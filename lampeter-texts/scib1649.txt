<HEAD><IT>The Description and Use of the</IT> Terrestrial Globe.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He <IT>Terrestrial</IT> or <IT>Earthlie Globe</IT> is an ar&rehy;tificial Respresentation of the Earth and Water under that form and figure of Roundness which they are supposed to have, describing the <IT>Situation</IT>, and measuring the Compass of the <IT>Whole Frame</IT>, and describing the Situation and measuring the Distances of all the Parts.
</P><P>This Description is either of the <IT>Earth</IT> and <IT>Water</IT> both together, and it is don by <IT>Circles</IT>; or of the Water consi&rehy;dered by it self; and is not so much a Description of that, as of the Mariner's cours upon it, or to shew <IT>The Waie of a Ship upon the Sea</IT>. And this is don by lines called <IT>Rumbes</IT>, which are not all Circles, but otherwise drawn according to the Point of the <IT>Compass</IT>, at which the Mariner set's forth. But of the <IT>Compass</IT> and these lines in the second Place; and first of the Description of the Whole Frame by Circles. Now look what <IT>Circles</IT> were imagined upon the Earth, the same are expressed upon, or framed with&rehy;out the <IT>Globe</IT>; and they are the <IT>Greater</IT>, or the <IT>Less</IT>. The <IT>Great Circles</IT> without the <IT>Globe</IT> are two; the <IT>Meridian</IT> and the <IT>Horizon</IT>: the one of Brass, the other of Wood. Circles indeed they are not so properly called; for, in the rigorous sens, no Line is supposed to have anie breadth, as both these have: But that was for the more convenience; for somthing more <PB
N="258">then ordinarie was to bee written upon them. And more&rehy;over they could not have been so disposed of, as they are, without the <IT>Globe</IT>, if they had not been exact Lines. But Use will have it so, and wee must call them the <IT>Meridian</IT> and <IT>Horizontal Circles</IT>.</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Meridian without the Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Brass Meridian is divided into 4 equal Parts or Quadrants, and each of them subdivided into 90 De&rehy;grees, that is 360 for the whole Circle. The reason why this Circle is not divided into 360 Degrees throughout, but still stopping at the 90&thsup;, and then again begining 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. is, becaus the Uses of this <IT>Meridian</IT>, so far as in Degrees they are concern'd, require not above that Number. As for an Example: One use of the <IT>Meridian</IT> is to shew the <IT>Elevation</IT> of the <IT>Pole</IT>, but the <IT>Pole</IT> cannot bee elevated above 90 Degrees. Another is to shew the <IT>Lati&rehy;tude</IT> or Distance of a Place from the <IT>Equator</IT>, which also can never exceed the 4&thsup; part of the Circle; for no Place can bee further distant from the <IT>Equator</IT> then the <IT>Pole</IT>, which is just that Number of 90 Degrees.
</P><P>Upon one of the North Quadrants of this <IT>Meridian</IT>, of som <IT>Great Globes</IT>, the <IT>Climes</IT> are set to the several Degrees of <IT>Latitude</IT>; and the Length of the longest Daie under the several <IT>Climes</IT>: which (if the Geographers would think so) might very fitly bee placed on the <IT>Lesser Globe's</IT>: for it were but dividing a Quadrant of the wrong side of the <IT>Meridian</IT> into 90 Degrees, and there would be room enough. In som other <IT>Globes</IT> the Climes are cast into a Table, and pi&rehy;ctured upon som void space of the <IT>Globe</IT>. But the Division upon a Quadrant of the <IT>Meridian</IT>, is much more artificial, as hereafter shall bee understood. And the reason why a North Quadrant onely need to bee divided, is, becaus for the <IT>Climes</IT> of the Southern <IT>Latitude</IT> the season is the same. And the reason why the Division is made upon a North Quadrant rather then the South, is, becaus our <IT>Globes</IT> are <PB
N="259">fitted for our Selvs, and all our share of the Earth lieth in the North <IT>Latitude</IT>.</P></DIV>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Axel and Poles of the Globe and of the Hour Circle</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Fic;Rom the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT> Ends of this <IT>Meridian</IT> a strong <IT>Wyer</IT> of Brass or Iron is drawn, or supposed to bee drawn (for the Artificers do not alwaies draw it quite through) by the Center of the <IT>Globe</IT> representing the <IT>Axel</IT> of the Earth. The North End whereof standeth for the <IT>North</IT>, the South End for the <IT>South Pole</IT> of the Earth. Upon the North End, a small Circle of Brass is set, and divided into two equal parts, and each of them into twelv, that is, twentie four in all. This Circle is the onelie one above the <IT>Globe</IT>, which is not imagined upon the Earth, but is there placed to shew the hour of the daie and night, in anie place where the Daie and night exceed not 24 hours: there&rehy;fore it is called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cyclus Horarius</FOREIGN>. The <IT>Hour Circle</IT>, for which purpose it hath a little Brass pin turning about upon the <IT>Pole</IT>, and pointing to the several hours, which therefore is called the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Index Horarius</FOREIGN></IT>.
</P><P>The small Circle is framed upon this ground, that in the <IT>Diurnal Motion</IT> of the Heaven 15 Degrees of the <IT>Equino&rehy;ctial</IT> rise up in the space of everie one hour, that is 360 De&rehy;grees, or the whole <IT>Circle</IT> in the space of 24. So that the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cyclus Horarius</FOREIGN> is to bee framed to that <IT>Compass</IT>, as that everie 24&thsup; part of it, or one hour is to bear proportion to 15 Degrees of the <IT>Equator</IT> below it. And so in turning the <IT>Globe</IT> about, one may perceiv, that while the Pin is moved from anie one hour to another, just 15 Degrees of the <IT>Equi&rehy;noctial</IT> will rise up above the Horizon upon one side, and as manie more go down below it on the other side. But this <IT>Circle</IT> is not much for the <IT>Geographer's</IT> use.</P></DIV>
<PB N="260"><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Horizon</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He other <IT>Great Circle</IT> without the <IT>Globe</IT> is the <IT>Horizon</IT>; upon which (yet not as due to this Circle more then anie other, but becaus there is more room) the <IT>Geographers</IT> set down the 12. Signs with their Names and Characters.
</P><P>And becaus everie Sign of the <IT>Zodiack</IT> containeth 30 De&rehy;grees, which is 360 for the whole Circle, the <IT>Horizon</IT> is divided into 360 Degrees indeed as it ought, but not from 10, 20, 30, 40, so throughout, but by Thirties, that is, 10, 20, 30. and 10, 20, 30, and so along to make the division conform to the 12 Signs, to each of which, as I said, is allotted the Number of 30 Degrees. And the reason of that is in reference to the Suns Annual Motion, in the Cours whereof hee dispatcheth everie daie one degree under or over. So that hee passeth through each of the <IT>Signs</IT> in, or in much about the space of 30 Daies. So that, though som of the 12 Moneths, answering to the 12 <IT>Signs</IT>, consist of one Daie more then thirtie, and one of 2 Daies less, yet take them one with another, and the Daies of everie Moneth correspond to the several Degrees of everie <IT>Sign</IT>, or without anie considerable difference. And after that rate, or much about it, they are placed upon the <IT>Horizon</IT>, to shew in what Degree, of what Sign the Sun is everie daie of the year. And to this purpose there is set down upon the same <IT>Horizon</IT> a <IT>Calendar</IT>, and that of three sorts in som Globes: Of two in the most, the one whereof is called the <IT>Julian</IT>, or <IT>Old</IT>, the other the <IT>Gregorian</IT>, or <IT>New Accompt</IT>, reckon&rehy;ing this latter 10 daies before the former, and the third sort, where it is found, thirteen. Now though it bee true that the greatest part of that which is written upon the <IT>Horizon</IT>, more nearly concerneth the <IT>Celestial</IT> then the <IT>Terrestrial Globe</IT>; yet it is not altogether unuseful here: and especi&rehy;ally it will bee nothing out of the <IT>Geographer's</IT> way to take along with him the ground of Difference in the 3, princi&rehy;pally in the 2 sorts of <IT>Calendars</IT>.</P></DIV>
<PB N="261"><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The Reason of the Difference in Computation be&rehy;twixt the</IT> Old <IT>and</IT> New Accompts.</HEAD>
<P>&Aic; Year is that space of time in which the <IT>Sun</IT> goeth through the whole Circle of the <IT>Zodiack</IT>, as from the <IT>Tropick</IT> of <IT>Cancer</IT>, to the <IT>Tropick</IT> of <IT>Capricorn</IT>, and so to the <IT>Tropick</IT> of <IT>Cancer</IT> again, or from the <IT>Equinoctial</IT> to the <IT>Equinoctial</IT>, or from anie other Point of the <IT>Zodiack</IT> to the same again. Now, becaus of the unequal Motion of the Sun (depending upon reasons deeply engaged in the <IT>Theo&rehy;rical</IT> Part of the <IT>Spheer</IT>, and therefore here to bee taken up&rehy;on trust) it ever was, and yet is, a very hard matter to de&rehy;termine exactly in what space of time this <IT>Revolution</IT> of the <IT>Sun</IT> in the <IT>Zodiack</IT> is made; insomuch that one said, that the Year consisted of so manie daies, and how much more or less no bodie knoweth. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT"><RO>Censori&rehy;nus</RO> de Die Natali</FOREIGN>.</NOTE>
</P><P>This uncertaintie brought so much confusion upon the Old <IT>Romane Calendars</IT>, that <IT>Time</IT> with them was grown a Commoditie, and bought and sold at a price. Their Priests, who had to do with this Affair, having in their power to make anie year longer or shorter at their pleasure; which the Emperor <IT>Julius C&aelig;sar</IT> looking upon as a mat&rehy;ter no waie below his greatest consideration, advised with som Egyptian Mathematicians about it, by whose Instru&rehy;ctions hee found that the Sun's yearlie Motion in the <IT>Zodi&rehy;ack</IT>, was performed in the space of 365 daies, and one 4&thsup; part of a daie, or 6 hours.</P>
<P>The 6 odd hours hee caussed to bee reserved in store till everie fourth year, that is, till they made 24 hours, or one whole daie; so accounting, that the 3 first years should consist of 365 daies, and the fourth of 366, one daie more; and everie fourth year was therefore (as still it is) called the <IT>Leap Year</IT>, and the thing it self <IT>Intercalation</IT>, or putting in betwixt the <IT>Calendar</IT>.</P>
<P>'Twas verie much that the Emperor did, and hee left as much to do; for though it cannot yet bee found out ex<PB
N="262">actly in what space of time the <IT>Sun</IT> goeth his yearlie cours, yet thus much is made good by infallible experience that the Emperor's <IT>Mathematicians</IT> allotted too much for the Number of daies: they were in the right, for <CORR
SIC="it it">it</CORR> is certain no year can consist of more then 365, but for the odd hours it is as certain that they cannot bee fewer then five, nor so manie as 6; so that the doubt is upon the <IT>Minutes</IT>, 60 whereof go to the making up of an Hour; a small matter one would think, and yet how great in the recess and con&rehy;sequence wee shall see.</P>
<P><IT>Julius C&aelig;sar</IT> allotted 365 daies and 6 hours to this Revo&rehy;lution, but the <IT>Sun</IT> goeth about in less time, that is, (ac&rehy;cording to the most exact Accompt) in 365 daies, 5 hours, 49 Minutes, and a little more; so that the Emperor's year is much about 10 Minutes greater then the <IT>Sun's</IT>, which must of necessitie breed a difference of so manie Minutes everie year, betwixt the <IT>Year</IT>, which the <IT>Sun</IT> it self de&rehy;scribe's in the <IT>Zodiack</IT>; and <IT>That</IT>, which is reckoned upon in the <IT>Calendar</IT>, which though for a year or two may pass in&rehy;sensibly, yet in the space of 134 years it will rise to an whole daie, that is the Begining of the year in the <IT>Calen&rehy;dar</IT> must bee set one daie back. As for Example: Let the year begin at the <IT>Vernal Equinox</IT> or Spring: In the Empe&rehy;ror's time that fell out to bee at the 24&thsup; of <IT>March</IT>, but now this year it fell out upon the 10&thsup; of <IT>March</IT>, 13 daies back&rehy;wards, and somwhat more, and so if it bee let alone will go back to the 1 of <IT>March</IT>, and 1 of <IT>Februarie</IT>, till <IT>Easter</IT> com to bee on <IT>Christmas Daie</IT>, and so infinitely.</P>
<P>To reform this difference in the Accompt, som of the later <IT>Romane Bishops</IT> earnestly endeavoured. And the thing was brought to that perfection it now standeth in (so much as it is) by <IT>Gregorie</IT> the 13&thsup;, in the Year 1582. His <IT>Ma&rehy;thematicians</IT> (whereof <IT>Lilius</IT> was the chief) advised him thus: That considering there had been an Agitation in the <IT>Councel</IT> of <IT>Nice</IT> somwhat concerned in this matter upon the motion of that Question about the <IT>Celebration</IT> of <IT>Easter</IT>: And that the Fathers of that Assemblie after due delibera&rehy;tion with the Astronomers of that time, had fixed the <IT>Ver<PB
N="263">nal Equinox</IT> at the 21 of <IT>March</IT>, and considering also that since that time a difference of 10 whole daies had been past over in the <IT>Calendar</IT>, that is, that the <IT>Vernal Equinox</IT> or Spring; which began upon the 21 of <IT>March</IT>, had prevented so much as to begin in <IT>Gregorie's</IT> daies at the 10&thsup; of the same, 10 daies difference or thereabouts; they advised that 10 daies should bee cut off from the <IT>Calendar</IT>, which was don, and the 10 daies taken out of <IT>October</IT> of that Year 1582, as being the Moneth of that Year in which that <IT>Pope</IT> was born; so that when they came to the 5 of the Moneth, they reckoned the 15, and so the <IT>Equinox</IT> was com up to it's place again, and hapned upon the 21 of <IT>March</IT>, as at the <IT>Councel</IT> of <IT>Nice</IT>. But that <IT>Lilius</IT> should bring back the <IT>Begining</IT> of the Year to the Times of the <IT>Ni&rehy;cen Councel</IT>, and no further, is to be marvelled at. Hee should have brought it back to the Emperor's own time, where the mistake was first entered, and, instead of 10, cut of 13 daies; however this is the Reason why these 2 <IT>Calendars</IT>, written upon the <IT>Horizon</IT>, differ the space of 10 daies one from the other. And as the <IT>Old Accompt</IT> was called the <IT>Julian</IT>, from the Emperor; so the <IT>New</IT> is called from <IT>Gregorie</IT> the <IT>Pope</IT> and <IT>Lilius</IT> the chief Agent, the <IT>Gregorian</IT> or <IT>Lilian Accompt</IT>: and the <IT>Julian</IT> is termed the <IT>Old Style</IT>, the <IT>Gregorian</IT> the <IT>New</IT>, as in the conversation of Letters betwixt Us and Those on the other side of the Seas wee may per&rehy;ceiv; Theirs to Us bare date (for the most part) such a daie of such a Moneth; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Stylo Novo</FOREIGN>; Ours to them such a daie; <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Stylo Veteri</FOREIGN></IT>: And Theirs may bee dated There, by their Accompt, and received here, before they were written by Ours.</P>
<P>For the third <IT>Calendar</IT> there need not much bee said, though it bee more absolute then the second; for it redu&rehy;ceth the Beginings of the Year to the Emperor's own Time, and so leaveth the <IT>Old Style</IT> 13 daies behinde as it ought to do. But it is very rarely found upon the <IT>Horizons</IT> of anie <IT>Globes</IT>, neither as yet translated to anie Common Use. In the outermost Limb of the <IT>Horizon</IT> are set down the Names <PB
N="264">of the 32 Windes of the <IT>Compass</IT>; to what end will bee shewed hereafter.</P></DIV>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Why the</IT> Meridians <IT>and</IT> Horizons <IT>which are so several upon the</IT> Earth, <IT>are but single without the</IT> Globe.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Reason of this will bee plain, if it bee considered that the <IT>Horizons</IT> and <IT>Meridians</IT>, in the use of the <IT>Globe</IT>, are to bee fitted to anie particular place at pleasure; as <IT>Oxford, Woodstock, Abingdon</IT>, &amp;c. this could never have been don upon the <IT>Globe</IT> it self; for there must a several <IT>Horizon</IT> and a several <IT>Meridian</IT> have passed through everie Citie, Town, or Castle upon the <IT>Globe</IT>, which if it had been don, besides the confusion, the Circles would have put out the <IT>Places</IT>; therefore it was ingenuously devised of those who first thought upon it, to set one <IT>Meridian</IT> and one <IT>Horizon</IT> without the <IT>Globe</IT> to serv for all: For in this case the <IT>Globe</IT> it self may bee turned and applied to the <IT>Ho&rehy;rizon</IT> and <IT>Meridian</IT> with as much eas, as the <IT>Horizon</IT> and <IT>Meridian</IT> with impossibilitie could not bee applied to the <IT>Globe</IT>, as it will hereafter more plainly appear, then it can do yet.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Quadrant of Altitude, and the Compass</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Mic;Oreover then the Circles framed without the <IT>Globe</IT>, two other <IT>Appendents</IT> are to bee noted upon; the one relating to the <IT>Meridian</IT>, the other to the <IT>Horizon</IT>: the first is the <IT>Quadrant</IT> of <IT>Altitude</IT>, and is a thin brass <IT>Plate</IT> repre&rehy;senting the fourth part of a <IT>Great Circle</IT>, and so divided into 90 Degrees, called therefore the <IT>Quadrant</IT>; and the <IT>Quadrant</IT> of <IT>Altitude</IT>, becaus it measureth the height of the Stars upon the <IT>Celestial Globe</IT>, to which it most proper<PB
N="265">ly belongeth. The business it hath to do in <IT>Geographie</IT>, is to set out the <IT>Zenith</IT> of anie Place, and consequently to shew the <IT>Angle</IT> of <IT>Position</IT>, or <IT>Bearing</IT> of one Place to ano&rehy;ther, as hereafter shall bee taught. It is therefore affixed to the <IT>Meridian</IT> with a little <IT>Screw-pin</IT>, to bee removed at pleasure from anie <IT>Ver&rehy;tical Point</IT> of anie <IT>Place</IT>, to the <IT>Vertical Point</IT> of anie other. The second is the <IT>Compass</IT>, which is a <IT>Needle</IT> touched with a <IT>Loadstone</IT>, and set in a Box upon the Foot of the <IT>Horizon</IT>, upon the South side, such ano&rehy;ther as wee see in ordinarie <IT>Pocket-Dyals</IT> for the <IT>Sun</IT>. The Use of it here (as in <IT>those</IT>) is to point out the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT> for the <IT>Rectification</IT> of the <IT>Globe</IT>, as shall bee more plainly said hereafter.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the</IT> Great Circles <IT>upon the Globe, and first of the</IT> Meridians.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He <IT>Great Circles</IT> painted upon the <IT>Globe</IT> are the <IT>Meridi&rehy;ans</IT>, the <IT>Equator</IT>, and the <IT>Zodiack</IT>; where wee must not think much to hear of the <IT>Meridians</IT> again. That of Brass without the <IT>Globe</IT> is to serv all turns, and the <IT>Globe</IT> is fra&rehy;med to applie it self thereto. The <IT>Meridians</IT> upon the <IT>Globe</IT> will easily bee perceived to bee of a new and another Use. They are either the <IT>Great</IT>, or the <IT>Less</IT>; not that the <IT>Greater</IT> are greater then the <IT>Less</IT>, for they have all one and the same <IT>Center</IT>, and equally pass through the <IT>Poles</IT> of the Earth: but those wich are called <IT>Less</IT>, are of less use then <IT>that</IT>, which is called the <IT>Great</IT>, though it bee no greater then the rest. The <IT>Great</IT> is otherwise called the <IT>Fixt</IT> and <IT>First Meridian</IT>, to which the <IT>Less</IT> are second, and respe&rehy;ctively moveable. The <IT>Great Meridian</IT> is as it were the <IT>Land&rehy;mark</IT> of the whole <IT>Sphere</IT>, from whence the <IT>Longitude</IT> of the Earth, or anie part thereof is accounted. And it is the onelie <IT>Circle</IT>, which passing through the <IT>Poles</IT>, is gradu&rehy;ated or divided into Degrees; not the whole Circle, but the one half, becaus the <IT>Longitude</IT> is to bee reckoned round about the Earth. This <IT>Great Meridian</IT> might have been <PB
N="266">planted in anie place, as at <IT>York</IT>, or at <IT>Richmond</IT>, but must of necessitie bee set in one certain place of the <IT>Globe</IT> or other, as it is in everie several Globe, though not in the same place in all.
</P></DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Concerning the Difference of Geographers in the pla&rehy;cing of their</IT> Great Meridian, <IT>and the Causses pretending thereto</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic;N assigning the place of this <IT>First</IT> or <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, I observ that the <IT>Geographers</IT>, whatsoever, still fix it in the <IT>Western Parts</IT>: And the Reasons are, not onely becaus <IT>those</IT> were more discovered then the <IT>Eastern</IT>, to those who had first to do in this matter; but more especially for that the <IT>Proper Motion</IT> of the Sun and Moon is from the <IT>West</IT> to the <IT>East</IT>, contrarie to their diurnal or dailie Motion; and therefore the <IT>Eclipses</IT> of the Moon are to bee observed from <IT>that Part</IT>, which is the most learned and certain Rule for the finding out of the <IT>Longitudes of Places</IT>, by observing how much sooner the <IT>Ecclips</IT> begineth in a Place more or less West then another. And moreover, wheresoever they place their <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, they still reckon the <IT>Longitude</IT> from West to East, that is, till they com up to 180 De&rehy;grees, or the <IT>Semicircle</IT>; where som of them staie and be&rehy;gin the <IT>Longitude</IT> again towards the East, calling the first <IT>Half, Eastern</IT>, the other, <IT>Western Longitude</IT>. But this Cours, howsoever Artificial enough, yet is not used by the later <IT>Geographers</IT>, for they account the <IT>Longitudes</IT> in the whole Circle throughout from West, by the East to West again, som few <IT>Spanish Geographers</IT> excepted, who, in the Descri&rehy;ptions of their <IT>New Indies</IT>, reckon the <IT>Longitudes</IT> quite con&rehy;trarie, from <IT>East</IT> to <IT>West</IT>, but which was thwartly in it self, and, in the proof, inconsiderably don. But as the <IT>Geogra&rehy;phers</IT> well enough agreed in the placing of this <IT>Great Me&rehy;ridian</IT> in the <IT>Western Parts</IT>; so they have differed much more then it becomed them in assigning out the <IT>Particular Place</IT>.

For the Situation of these Islands they lie not as <IT>Ptolomie</IT> placed them, within one Degree of <IT>Longitude</IT>, or little less, but more scattering, and lifted up a little above the <IT>Tropick</IT> of <IT>Cancer</IT> about the 30&thsup; Degree of the <IT>Northern Latitude</IT>, in that Part of the <IT>We&rehy;stern</IT> (otherwise called the <IT>Atlantick) Oce&auml;n</IT> which trendeth upon the Coast of <IT>Affrick</IT>, and are therefore reckoned by <IT>Geographers</IT> to the <IT>Affrican Isles</IT>. This was the furthest part of the Earth discovered towards the <IT>West</IT> to those of about <IT>Ptolomie's</IT> time: therefore the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> was fixed there, in the Isle <IT>Hera</IT>, or <IT>Junonia</IT>, as then it was called, now <IT>Tenariff</IT>: And from this <IT>Meridian</IT> all the <IT>Longitudes</IT> in the <IT>Greek-Geographie</IT> are taken.
</P><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The Arabick Meridian.</NOTE> This the <IT>Arabian-Geographers</IT> knew well enough; but holding themselvs not to bee inferior (as indeed they were not) either to the <IT>Indefatigation</IT> or <IT>Skill</IT> of the <IT>Greek&rehy;Geographers</IT>, they hoped to have the begining of <IT>Longitude</IT> taken from them, which therefore they appointed to bee drawn up on the uttermost Shoar of the <IT>Western-Oce&auml;n</IT> 10 Degrees more <IT>East</IT> then that of <IT>Ptolomie</IT>: but they deceived themselvs doubly; for first, Their <IT>Meridian</IT> would not bee brought into Example by others: and again, It was not so improvidently intended, as not to serv themselvs. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Alphraganus</IT> chap.10.</NOTE> For according to the loss, or gains of the Sea upon that Shore, their <IT>Longitudes</IT> have proved to bee importantly different, rightly enough assign'd, but falsifying with the Place, as <PB
N="268">they are justly served. There is not, for the present, anie verie great Use to the <IT>Geographer</IT> of the <IT>Arabick-Meridian</IT> more then to know it; for the <IT>Turkish Histories</IT> are not so com&rehy;pletely derived down to us as to Describe the Territories by <IT>Longitude</IT>, or <IT>Latitude</IT>. And for the <IT>Arabick-Nubian-Geogra&rehy;phie</IT> Translated into Latine by the <IT>Maronites</IT>, though other&rehy;wise of a rare, and pretious esteem, yet is not commend&rehy;ed for this, That the Distances of Places are there set down by a gross Mensuration of Miles: and <IT>John Leos Af&rehy;frica</IT> is not so well. But when the Learned, and long promised <IT>Geographie</IT> of <IT>Abulfedea</IT> the Prince shall com to light, there can bee nothing don there, without this <IT>Me&rehy;ridian</IT>. The Prince setteth down the <IT>Longitude</IT> of <IT>Mecca</IT> 67 Degrees. The <IT>Greek Geographie</IT> 77: and they are both right, and yet they differ 10 Degrees: for so much were their <IT>Meridian</IT> set <IT>East</IT>, or <IT>West</IT> one then the other. Yet nei&rehy;ther is this <IT>Meridian</IT> presently altogether unuseful, for besides the <IT>Longitudes</IT> of som places noted by <IT>Saracenus, Al&rehy;bategni</IT> and others, there is a <IT>Catalogue</IT> of Cities annexed to the <IT>Astronomical Tables</IT> of the King <IT>Alphonsus</IT> accounted all from this Great <IT>Meridian</IT>, but with this difference, That whereas <IT>Abulfedea</IT> the Prince setteth down but 10 De&rehy;grees distance betwixt the <IT>Fortunate Isles</IT>, and the <IT>Western Shore</IT>, the <IT>Catalogue</IT> reckoneth upon 17, and 30 Minutes: a Difference too great to bee given over to the <IT>Recesses</IT> of the <IT>Ocean</IT> from that Shore, and therefore I know not as yet what can bee said thereto.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The Magneti&rehy;cal Meridian.</NOTE> Our own <IT>Geographers</IT>, the later especially, have affected to transplant this great <IT>Meridian</IT> out of the <IT>Canarie Isles</IT> in&rehy;to the <IT>A&ccedil;ores</IT>, or <IT>Azores</IT>, for so the <IT>&ccedil;erilla</IT> will endure to bee pronounced.

And it is no stranger a thing, then that <IT>December</IT> should bee called by our <IT>Saxon</IT> Fore-fathers &wynn;olfe Monat, that is, <IT>Wolf-Moneth</IT>; for that in those Daies this <IT>Isle</IT> was mischievously pestered with such Wilde-Beasts, and in that Moneth more ragingly, <PB
N="269">though now such a sight is grown so forreign to these parts, that they are looked upon with the Strangeness of a Camel, or an Elephant. The <IT>Azores</IT> are otherwise termed <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Insul&aelig; Flandric&aelig;</FOREIGN>, or the <IT>Flemish Isles</IT>, becaus som of them have been famously possessed, and first Discovered by them. They are now in number Nine: <IT>Tercere, S&tsup; Micha&euml;l, S. Ma&rehy;rie, S. George, Gratiosa, Pico, Fayall, Corvo, Flores</IT>; they are situate in the same <IT>Atlantick Ocean</IT>, but North-West of the <IT>Canaries</IT>, and trending more upon the <IT>Spanish</IT> Coast, under the 39 Degree of <IT>Latitude</IT>, or therebouts. Through these <IT>Isles</IT> the Late <IT>Geographers</IT> will have the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> to pass, upon this conceit of reconciling the <IT>Magnetical Pole</IT> to That of the World. Their meaning is, That the <IT>Needle</IT> of the <IT>Mariner's Compass</IT>, which touched with the <IT>Magnet</IT>, or <IT>Loadstone</IT>, in dutie ought to point out true <IT>North</IT>, and <IT>South Poles</IT> of the World in all other Places, performeth it onely in these <IT>Isles</IT>, whereas for the most part elswhere it swerveth, or maketh a Variation from the true <IT>Meridian</IT> to&rehy;wards the <IT>East</IT>, or <IT>West</IT>, according to <CORR
SIC="tht">the</CORR> unequal temper of the Great <IT>Magnet</IT> of the Earth: therefore notwithstan&rehy;ding that the <IT>Greek Meridian</IT> was placed well enough in the <IT>Canaries</IT>, (as indeed it was, and best of all, becaus once fix&rehy;ed there) yet it pleased them to think that it would bee more Artificial, and Gallant to remove it into the <IT>Azores</IT>, where (as they would bear us in hand) the <IT>Magnetical Needle</IT> precisely directeth it self towards the <IT>North</IT>, and <IT>South</IT> of the Whole Frame without the least Variation, which might seem to bee a <IT>Natural Meridian</IT>, and therefore to bee yielded unto by that of <IT>Art</IT>, wheresoever placed before.</P>
<P>This <IT>Coincidencie</IT> of the <IT>Magnetical Meridian</IT> with that of the <IT>World</IT>, Som of them will have to bee in the Isles <IT>Corvo</IT>, and <IT>Flores</IT>, the most Western: Others in S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT>, and S. <IT>Marie</IT>, the more Eastern of the <IT>Azores</IT>. <NOTE

<P>But which is more, the <IT>Magnetical Needle</IT> hath no cer&rehy;tain <IT>Pole</IT> in the Earth at all, and under the verie same <IT>Meridian</IT> is found to varie in som places but 3, or 4 De&rehy;grees; in other 17, and more; and which is wors (if it bee true) the Variation it self hath been lately charged up&rehy;on with a verie strange and secret inconstancie by the Pro&rehy;fessor in <IT>Astronomie</IT> of <IT>Gresham</IT>-College. Hee saith that the Variation of the <IT>Needle</IT> at <IT>Limehous</IT> near <IT>London</IT>, which M&rsup; <IT>Burrows</IT> found to bee 11 Degrees, 15 Minutes, in the year 1580: M <IT>Gunter</IT> in the year 1622 found it to bee but 6 Degrees 13 Minutes. But Hee himself in the year 1634 found it to bee but 4 Degrees, or verie little more; which in the space of 54 years is a difference of 7 Degrees to the Less. So little reason is there why the <IT>Greek Meridian</IT> should give place to the <IT>Magnetical</IT>, besides the great confusion which must needs follow, as it hath.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">The <IT>Toletan</IT> Meridian.</NOTE> But yet more impertinently, the <IT>Spanish Describers</IT> remem&rehy;bred before, not onely account their <IT>Longitude</IT> from East to West, utterly against all other <IT>Geographie</IT>, but not content&rehy;ed with the <IT>Greek, Arabian</IT>, or any <IT>Magnetical Meridian</IT>, must needs reckon their <IT>Indies</IT> from that of <IT>Toledo</IT>.

REND="it" LANG="LAT">Exiguus quidem, sed notabilis & perpetuus</Q>, As <IT>smal</IT>, but as <IT>notable</IT> and <IT>perpetual</IT> as 'tis possible. The Island hee assigned was <IT>Teneriff</IT>, thought to bee the same with <PB
N="271"><IT>Ptolomie's Hera</IT>, or <IT>Junonia</IT>. The place <IT>Pico de Teide</IT>, or <IT>el pico, The Peak</IT>, a Mountain so called from the sharpness of the top, and therefore the place is <FOREIGN

<P>This <IT>Johnson</IT> a great Master of this Art considering with himself, though in his lesser <IT>Globe</IT> of the year 1602 hee had made the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> to pass through the Isles <IT>Cor&rehy;vo</IT> and <IT>Flores</IT>; yet since that, in his Greater of the year 1616 hee hath it drawn upon the <IT>Peak</IT> in <IT>Tenariffe</IT>, as hee ex&rehy;presseth himself in a void place of the <IT>Globe</IT>. Onely, whereas hee addeth that by this means the <IT>Arabick Meridian</IT>, and That of <IT>Ptolomie</IT> will bee all one upon the matter (which hee saith was fit to bee admonished) it must needs bee mista&rehy;ken. 'Tis true, that the <IT>Canaries</IT> lie near upon the Coast of <CORR
SIC="corick"><IT>Affrick</IT></CORR>: But the <IT>Arabians</IT> mean not this so much by the uttermost Shore, as the uttermost Points of the Western Land running along by the Streights of <FOREIGN
LANG="ARA" REND="it">Gebal Taric</FOREIGN>, or <IT>Ta&rehy;ric's</IT> Hill, as they rightly (wee <IT>Gibralter</IT>) call it, where the Pillars of <IT>Hercules</IT> were set of old, as our Stories deliver, but of <IT>Alexander</IT> they saie, to whom, and not to <IT>Hercules</IT> the <IT>Arabick Nubian Geographer</IT> asscribeth this Labor, naming there the verie Artificers which that great King provided himself of to force out the Streight; which may possibly bee the reason, why the <IT>Arabians</IT> (over and above their am&rehy;bition of Change) draw their Great <IT>Meridian</IT> by this Part, in honor to <IT>Alexander</IT>, whom therefore they call not so, but <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="ARA">Dhilcarnain</FOREIGN>, that is, <IT>The man of the two Horns</IT>, for that hee joined the Ends of the Known World together by those Pillars in the East upon one side, and these in the West on the other. Which seeing it is so, the Reduceing of the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> to <IT>Tenariff</IT> again will bee so far from closing with that of the Uttermost Western Shore, that ac&rehy;cording to the Account of som they will stand at 15 De&rehy;grees distance one from the other, which also maketh show <PB
N="272">of som reason of the Disagreement betwixt <IT>Abulfeda</IT> the Prince, and the King <IT>Alphonsus</IT> in assigning the difference of the <IT>Arabick Meridian</IT> from the <IT>Greek</IT>, the Prince allowing but 10, The <IT>Catalogue</IT> 17 Degrees, which was noted before.</P>
<P>For any concurrence therefore of the <IT>Greek</IT>, and <IT>Arabick Meridians</IT> by this means, wee are not to take the <IT>Ge&rehy;ographer's</IT> word; but nevertheless to embrace this Alterati&rehy;on of his Cours in bringing the <IT>Greek Meridan</IT> to his <IT>place</IT> again.</P>

<P>&Aic;Nd now if one may make so bold as to give Law to the <IT>Geographers</IT>, it cannot bee denied but that the readiest and least entangling waie of reckoning the <IT>Longitudes</IT> is to meet again upon the first <IT>Meridian</IT> in <IT>Tenariffe</IT>, but for want of this, and til it can bee rellish't universally, the likest waie <PB
N="273">to the Best is for the Describers either of the Whole, or any Part of the Earth not to fail of setting down the se&rehy;veral <IT>Meridians</IT> obteining as then. Also the Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt these <IT>Meridians</IT>, and lastly which of those they mean to go by. If I were to draw up (If I could) a New <IT>Geographie</IT> of the Whole Earth, This, or the like to this ought to prepare to the Description.
</P><P>That the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> by the most Antient <IT>Greek Geo&rehy;graphers</IT> was made to pass through the <IT>Fortunate Islands</IT>, now called The <IT>Canaries</IT>. That from thence it was translated by the <IT>Arabians</IT> to the uttermost Point of the Western-Shore. That our own <IT>Geographers</IT> removed it into the <IT>Azores</IT> pla&rehy;cing it som of them in S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT>, others in <IT>Corvo</IT>. That the Best of them brought it back to the <IT>Canaries</IT> again, and drew it upon the <IT>Pico</IT> in <IT>Tenariffe</IT>; The same, or thought to bee the same with <IT>Ptolomie's Junonia</IT>. That the Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> from <IT>El Pico</IT> to the <IT>Arabick Meridian</IT> is 10 De&rehy;grees more East according to <IT>Abulfeda</IT> the Prince. From <IT>Pi&rehy;co</IT> to the Isle of S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT> 9 Degrees. From <IT>Pico</IT> to <IT>Corvo</IT> 15, and both so much more West. And such, or such a <IT>Meridian</IT> I mean to follow.</P>
<P>To this very purpose the same <IT>Abulfeda</IT> in the Intro&rehy;duction to his <IT>Geographie</IT>. It is received by Tradition (saith hee) that the Inhabited Earth begineth at the West in the <IT>Fortunate Isles</IT>, as they are called, and lying waste as now. From these Islands som take the Begining of <IT>Longi&rehy;tude</IT>. Others from the Western Shore. The Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> is 10 Degrees accounted in the <IT>Equator, &amp;c.</IT> As for the <IT>Longitudes</IT> reckoned in this Book, they are all taken from the Shores of the Western Oce&auml;n, and therefore they are 10 Degrees short of those which are taken from the <IT>Fortu&rehy;nate Isles, &amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>If wee now exact (as I think wee may) to this Rule, which hath been lately don by our own Describers espe&rehy;cially, wee may perhaps finde it otherwise then wee thought for.</P>
<P>Here it will not need to take much notice of those who have described the Situation of Countries by the <IT>Climes</IT> and <PB
N="274"><IT>Paralells</IT>. Thus much onely, That they had as good as said nothing. I confess I conclude under this Censure, the verie good Autor of the Estates <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="FRA">du Mond</FOREIGN>, translated by <IT>Grimstone</IT>. But it was to bee noted. For what if I saie that Great <IT>Bri&rehy;tain</IT> lieth under the 9&thsup; and 13 <IT>Climates</IT> of the Northern Temperate <IT>Zone</IT> (as 'tis no otherwise Describ'd to the Site by a <IT>Geographer</IT> of our own) is this to tell where <IT>England</IT> is? No more then to tell where the Streights of <IT>Anian</IT> are much about the same <IT>Clime</IT> and <IT>Paralel</IT>, and yet 160 De&rehy;grees distant and more.</P>
<P>They are not much more accurate who Describe the Si&rehy;tuation of Countries by their <IT>Latitudes</IT> onely as the Gentle&rehy;man in his Description of <IT>Huntingdon Shire</IT> inserted into M. <IT>Speed</IT>. And the most learned Sir <IT>Henrie Spelman</IT> in his Description of <IT>Northfolk</IT>. It is no more to saie the Situation of this, or that place then of anie other in the Whole Sphere lying under the same <IT>Parallel</IT>. But to saie the truth, By reason of the Varietie of <IT>Meridians</IT>. The <IT>Longitudes</IT> were grown to such an uncertain and confused pass, that it was not everie man's work to set them down.</P>
<P>M&rsup; <IT>Carew</IT> in his Survey of <IT>Cornwall</IT> setteth down that Shire in the <IT>Longitude</IT> of 6 Degrees (I believ hee mean't 16) as most men account. But what doe's hee mean by that; or what manner of account is it which most men use in this case? <IT>Norden</IT> in the Introduction to his <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Speculum Britanni&aelig;</FOREIGN> saith, That the Center of this Land, which hee taketh to bee about <IT>Titburie Castle</IT> in <IT>Stafford-Shire</IT> is 21 Degrees and 28 Minutes of <IT>Longitude</IT>. But from what <IT>Meridian</IT> all this while? for the <IT>Longitude</IT> may bee manie Degrees more, or less, or just so much as hee saith, and yet all may bee true.</P>
<P>M&rsub; <IT>Speed</IT> more particularly professeth to follow <IT>Merca&rehy;tor</IT>; as in assigning the <IT>Longitude</IT> of <IT>Oxford</IT>, hee saith, that it is distant from the West 19 Degrees 20 Minutes by <IT>Mer&rehy;cator's</IT> Measure. So M. <IT>William Burton</IT> in the Description of <IT>Leicester-Shire</IT>. But how are wee the wiser for this? <IT>Merca&rehy;tor's</IT> Measure was not the same, for in his <IT>Globe</IT> dedicated to the Lord <IT>Granvella</IT> the great <IT>Meridian</IT> passeth through <PB
N="275">the <IT>Canaries</IT>; but in his great <IT>Map</IT> through the <IT>Azores</IT> M. <IT>Ga&rehy;briel Richardson</IT> in the State of Europe yet more distinctly telleth his Reader, That the <IT>Longitudes</IT> in his book shall bee taken from that <IT>Meridian</IT>, which passeth through the <IT>Azores</IT>. But whether from that in S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT>, or from the other in <IT>Corvo</IT> is not set down, and yet the Difference is 7 Degrees, and more: But hear lastly the Kingdom's <IT>Geo&rehy;grapher</IT> in the Preface to his <IT>Britannia</IT>. <Q

In <IT>Latitude</IT> I found them to differ from <IT>Ptolo&rehy;mie</IT> very much, but well enough agreeing among themselvs: and yet I cannot think that the Earth is any whit startled aside from it's Center, as <IT>Stadius</IT> did. These Tables there&rehy;fore I made use of. But in the <IT>Longitude</IT> I found no agree&rehy;ment at all. What should I do?

<P>And now the least that can bee exspected is, that the <IT>Longitudes</IT> of all Places in the <IT>Britannia</IT> are accounted from the <IT>Meridian</IT> which passeth by the <IT>Azores</IT>. But from which of the <IT>Meridians</IT>? If it bee as the book expresseth <FOREIGN

But I can perceiv that the <IT>Geographer</IT>, though otherwise most accomplished, yet was not so well seen in this piece of the Skill; for though it bee pretended in the Preface that all the <IT>Longitudes</IT> in the Description shall bee taken from the <IT>Azores</IT>, yet in setting down the <IT>Longitude</IT> of <IT>Oxford</IT>, hee saith, That as hee hath it from the Mathematicians of the Place, it is 22 Degrees from the <IT>Fortunate Islands</IT> which can never bee true, for 'tis but 19 from the <IT>Azores</IT> reckoning by S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT>: But this is not all: In assigning the <IT>Longi&rehy;tude</IT> of <IT>Pen-von-las</IT>; or, <IT>The Land's-end</IT> in <IT>Cornwall</IT>, Hee saith that is 17 Degrees <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">&agrave; Fortunatis Insulis vel poti&ugrave;s Azoris</Q>, from the <IT>Fortunate Islands</IT> or rather from the <IT>Azores</IT>. But <CORR
SIC="is is">is</CORR> the Difference so small did hee think? But 9 De&rehy;grees at least.</P>
<P>But I finde by the <IT>Longitudes</IT> that <IT>Mercator</IT> was the Man that set up all these for <IT>Geographers</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Mercator</IT> first of all kept himself to the Greek <IT>Meridian</IT>, as, <IT>Appian, Gemma Frisius, Maginus</IT>, and others; but under&rehy;standing by <IT>Francis</IT> of <IT>Deip</IT>, an experienced Mariner, that the <IT>Compass</IT> had no Variation in the Islands of <IT>Capo Verde</IT>. And by others, that it had very little in <IT>Tercera</IT>, and S. <IT>Marie</IT> of the <IT>Azores</IT>, but not anie at all in the Isle <IT>Corvo</IT>, that hee might go a mean waie to work, and complie with the Common <IT>Meridian</IT> of the World (as hee took it to bee). Hee made his Great <IT>Meridian</IT> to pass (as himself saith) be&rehy;twixt the Isles of <IT>Capo Verde</IT> and the <IT>Azores</IT>; that is, Through the Isles of S. <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT> and S. <IT>Marie</IT>, which was <PB
N="277">afterwards taken for Example by <IT>Plancius, Saunderson</IT>, and the common sort of others, so that little or no notice at all was taken of the <IT>Meridian</IT> by <IT>Corvo</IT>, no not by those of the biggest expectation, as M. <IT>Carpenter</IT>, M. <IT>Camden</IT>, M. <IT>Speed</IT>, and the rest; although this also was the known <IT>Meridian</IT> of som <IT>Globes</IT> of the very same Times; and before that, that is, before they had set their last <IT>hand</IT> to their <IT>Descriptions</IT>. And 'tis no mervail, for <IT>Mercator's Longitudes</IT> were more exactly accounted then before, and therefore they might well take his <IT>Meridian</IT> along with them. And 'twas not amiss to go by the most <IT>received</IT>, but then they should have said so, and withall, have set down the three severall <IT>Meridians</IT> at least, and the difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt them; and all this with more distinction then so, that ano&rehy;ther man should com after them to tell themselvs what <IT>Me&rehy;ridian</IT> they went by.</P>
<P><IT>And thus much of the First, or Great</IT> Meridian.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Lesser Meridians</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Lesser are those <IT>Black Circles</IT>, which you see to pass through the <IT>Poles</IT>, and succeeding to the Great at 10 and 10 Degrees as in most <IT>Globes</IT>; or as in som, at 15 and 15 Degrees Difference.
</P><P>Everie place, never so little more East, or West then ano&rehy;ther, hath a several <IT>Meridian.

N="278">bee 130 in all, but except the <IT>Globes</IT> were made of an Ex&rehy;treme and Unuseful <IT>Diameter</IT>, so manie would stand too thick for the Description. Therefore most commonly they put down but 18; that is at 10 Degrees distance one from the other, the special use of these Lesser <IT>Meridians</IT> beeing to make a quicker dispatch in the account of the <IT>Longitudes</IT>. Som others, as <IT>Mercator</IT> set down but 12 at 15 Degrees dif&rehy;ference, aiming at this, That the <IT>Meridians</IT> might bee distant one from the other a full part of time, or an hour: for seeing that the Sun is carried 15 Degrees off the <IT>Equi&rehy;noctial</IT> everie hour, as was said before. The <IT>Meridians</IT> set at that Distance must make an hours difference in the Rising or Setting of the Sun to the several places, as if the Sun Rise at such an hour, such a daie of the year at <IT>Oxford</IT>. In a place 15 Degrees more distant towards the East the Sun riseth an hour sooner. In a place 15 Degrees distant towards the West, an hour later, the same daie of this, or that year.</P>
<P>Now becaus the Spaces of time are reckoned by the same Degrees of the <IT>Equator</IT> as the Distances of Place, The De&rehy;grees of <IT>Longitude</IT> have been called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Tempora</FOREIGN>; which word <IT>Camden</IT> somtimes delighteth to use, as in the <IT>Longitude</IT> of <IT>Bath</IT> hee saith it is 20 <IT><FOREIGN

<P>&Tic;He <IT>Equator</IT> is the Middle Circle betwixt two <IT>Poles</IT> gra&rehy;duated throughout, and plainly dividing the <IT>Globe</IT> into two equal Parts, from North to South, This is the <IT>Circle</IT> of <IT>Longitude</IT>, as the <IT>Meridian</IT> of <IT>Latitude</IT>; for <IT>Lon&rehy;gitude</IT> is reckoned in the <IT>Equator</IT> from the <IT>Meridian: Lati&rehy;tude</IT> in the <IT>Meridian</IT> from the <IT>Equator</IT>.

<P>&Tic;He Cours of a Ship upon the Sea dependeth upon the Windes. The Designation of these, upon the certain Knowledg of one Principal; which considering the Situ&rehy;ation and condition of the whole Sphere, ought in nature to bee North, or South. The North to us upon this side of the Line, the South to those in the other Hemisphere; for in making this observation, Men were to intend them&rehy;selvs towards one fixed part of the Heavens, or other, and therefore to the one of these. In the South Part there is not found anie Star so notable, and of so near a distance from the <IT>Pole</IT>, as to make anie precise or firm Direction of that Winde. But in the North wee have that of the second Ma&rehy;gnitude in the Tail of the <IT>Lesser Bear</IT>, making so smal, and, for the Motion, so insensible a Circle about the <IT>Pole</IT>, that it cometh all to one, as if it were the <IT>Pole</IT> it self. This pointed out the North-winde to the Mariners of old especially; and was therefore called by som the <IT>Load</IT>, or <IT>Lead-Star</IT>. But this could bee onely in the night, and not alwaies then. It is now more constantly and surely shewed by the <IT>Needle</IT> <PB
N="280">touched with the <IT>Magnete</IT>, which is therefore called the <IT>Load</IT> or <IT>Leadstone</IT>, for the same reason on the leading and di&rehy;recting their Courses: in the Nature and Secret of which Stone, becaus the whole business of <IT>Navigation</IT> is so throughly concern'd, somthing is to bee borrowed out of that <IT>Philosophie</IT>.
</P></DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The Original of the Mariner's Compass from the Magnetical Constitution of the Earth</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Aic; <IT>Magnetical Bodie</IT> is described to bee <IT>That</IT>, which han&rehy;ging in the <IT>A&euml;rial</IT> or <IT>&AElig;therial</IT> Parts of the Univers, firmly seateth it self upon it's own <IT>Poles</IT>, in a <IT>Situation</IT> natu&rehy;ral and unchangeable, consisting also of som such parts as se&rehy;parated from the rest can take upon them the nature and conditions of the whole.
</P><P>Under this Description the <IT>Magnetical Philosophers</IT> com&rehy;prehend the Globes of <IT>Saturn, Jupiter</IT>, the <IT>Sun</IT>, &amp;c. but be&rehy;caus these Bodies are placed so far above the reach of our Experience, and purpose; it shall bee sufficient to make the <IT>Description</IT> good upon the <IT>Earth</IT>.</P>
<P>To do this, I think I may suppose, First, that the Con&rehy;stitution of the <IT>Whole Earth</IT> may bee gathered from the pre&rehy;vailing parts, such parts especially as do bear upon them the <IT>Marks</IT> and <IT>Signatures</IT> of the <IT>Whole</IT>.</P>
<P>Then secondly, That the parts of the Earth, which lie couched about the <IT>Center</IT>, are not of a different of dege&rehy;nerous compliance from these which lie scattered about the Surface; which if anie bodie lift to rais suspicions upon, as M&rsup; <IT>White</IT> hath don, they may: but I am sure they were no nearer <IT>Him, when hee lai'd the Foundations of the Earth</IT>, then wee.</P>
<P>The prevailing parts about the Surface of the Earth, are the Mines of <IT>Loadstone, Steel, Iron</IT>, &amp;c. of all which, it is certain, that they are indued with a virtue <IT>Magnetical</IT>, which enableth them to place themselvs in a set position betwixt <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT>: And not onely these, but even <IT>Claie</IT> it self, burnt to Brick, and cooled <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT>, if it bee hanged up in a close place, and left to it's libertie, will seat it self in the same Situation.</P>
<PB N="281"><P>But the most vigorous <IT>Magnetes</IT> are the <IT>Stone</IT> and the <IT>Steel</IT>, the <IT>Stone</IT> especially: And the <IT>Steel</IT> hath a capacitie to receiv a stronger virtue from the <IT>Stone</IT>, whereby it more firmly seat&rehy;eth it self in the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South-Position</IT> of the Earth, directly pointing out those Windes to the Mariner; not in all parts directly, becaus in following the Constitution of the <IT>Great Magnete</IT> of the <IT>Whole Earth</IT>, it must needs bee here and there led aside towards the <IT>East</IT> or <IT>West</IT>, by the unequal temper of the <IT>Globe</IT>, consisting more of <IT>Water</IT> then of <IT>Earth</IT> in som places, and of <IT>Earth</IT> more or less <IT>Magnetical</IT> in others.

<P>This Motion of the <IT>Needle</IT> was accidentally discovered by <IT>Robert Norman</IT>, a Man of great dexteritie in the framing and dressing up of the <IT>Mariner's Compass</IT>. It hapned to him, that, as often as hee had finished his <IT>Needles</IT>, and equally poized them upon their <IT>Pins</IT>, hee had no sooner touched them with the Stone, but still the <IT>North-Point</IT> of the <IT>Needle</IT> would forsake the parallel Site in which hee had placed it, and incline it self to the <IT>Axis</IT> of the <IT>Earth</IT>. The reason whereof not presently perceiv'd, escaped a while, with a conceit, as if the Artificer had deceived himself in ballancing <PB
N="282">the <IT>Needle</IT>; which therefore hee endeavoured to correct with a little peice of <IT>Wax</IT> stuck upon the lighter End (as hee took it to bee) till at last, beeing imploied in the framing of a <IT>Compass</IT>, the <IT>Needle</IT> whereof was to bee 6 inches in length, and having polished and levelled it with all possible care, and yet after the touching of it with the <IT>Stone</IT>, finding one end to weigh down the other, hee was forced to cut off som part of the heavier end, (as hee still mistook it) and so more, till hee had made the <IT>Needle</IT> unserviceable: whereupon, consul&rehy;ting with som knowing Friends, hee was advised to make som Instruments to trie out the experience. And it was found to bee this verie <IT>Inclination</IT> to the <IT>Axis</IT> of the Earth, and proportionably, though not equally, answering to the Degrees of <IT>Latitude</IT>.</P>
<P>But this Inclination also, as the Direction, is variable, and for the same causses of the Earth's unequal temper.</P>
<P>But all that which I have said will more evidently and ex&rehy;pertly appear, upon the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Terrella</FOREIGN>, or little Earth of <IT>Load&rehy;stone</IT>.</P>
<P>As the <IT>Great Magnete</IT> of the Earth, so everie <IT>Magnetical</IT> part thereof, and everie part of that, hath <IT>Poles, Axis, Equator, Me&rehy;ridians</IT>, and <IT>Parallels</IT> of it's own. The <IT>Magnetical Philoso&rehy;phers</IT> therefore, to represent unto themselvs the Great Na&rehy;ture of the Whole, take a strong small piece of a <IT>Rock</IT>, which having reduced into a <IT>Globous</IT> form, they first found out the <IT>Poles</IT> by the filings of Steel (or otherwise) which will all meet together upon the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South</IT> Points. A <IT>Circle</IT> drawn equidistantly from these describeth the <IT>Equator</IT>. This don, they take a smal Steel wyer, of about half an inch long, and applie it to anie part of the <IT>Equator</IT>, and it will precisely turn towards the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South Poles</IT>, which is <IT>Motion of Direction</IT>, and marketh out the <IT>Meridians</IT> of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Terrella</FOREIGN>. But supposing a Concavitie to bee let into this <IT>Little Earth</IT>, in anie part, either about the <IT>Equator</IT>, or be&rehy;twixt it and the <IT>Poles</IT>: In that case the <IT>Needle</IT> will not point directly to the <IT>Poles</IT>, but will make a <IT>Variation</IT>; unless it bee placed exactly towards the Middle of the <IT>Concavitie</IT>, and then it maketh no Variation at all, but turneth directly, as <PB
N="283">before; which from the Causses justifieth the <IT>Directions</IT>, and <IT>Variations</IT> of the <IT>Compass</IT>, towards and from the <IT>Poles</IT> of the <IT>Earth</IT>.</P>
<P>Remove this Wyer from the <IT>Equator</IT> towards the <IT>Pole</IT>, and the one Ende of it will rise up as <IT>Norman's Needle</IT> did, and the other End will stick down upon the <IT>Stone</IT>, making an <IT>Acute Angle</IT>, and describing a <IT>Parallel</IT>. Remove it nearer to the <IT>Pole</IT>, and the <IT>Angle</IT> will bee less and less acute, till at <CORR
SIC="a a">a</CORR> certain Parallel it becom a <IT>Right Angle</IT> to the Stone. Re&rehy;move it yet nearer, and the Angle will bee <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Recto Major</FOREIGN>, or more and more obtuse. Bring it up to the <IT>Pole</IT> it self, and it will there stand bolt upright, and make one Line with the <IT>Axis</IT> of the <IT>Stone</IT>; which maketh good the Inclination of the <IT>Needle</IT> to the <IT>Diameter</IT> of the Great <IT>Magnete</IT>: for if <IT>Norman</IT> had touched his <IT>Needle</IT> under the <IT>Line</IT>, it would have stood level upon the <IT>Pin</IT> without anie Declination at all. If hee had touched it in anie place beyond the <IT>Line</IT>, the In&rehy;clination, would have been on the <IT>South</IT> side; but living here more towards this <IT>Pole</IT>, it must needs fall out as hee found it. <IT><FOREIGN

The next thing is, that it bee placed in the <IT>North</IT> and <IT>South-Position</IT> of the Earth as di&rehy;rectly as it may. This dependeth upon the knowledg of the <IT>Meridian</IT> of the place, but may well enough bee don by a <IT>Needle</IT>, whose Variation is known, such an one as is used to bee set upon the South side of the Foot of som <IT>Globes</IT>, for the same purpose: then lift up the <IT>North-Pole</IT> above the <IT>Ho&rehy;rizon</IT> so manie Degrees as will answer to the <IT>Latitude</IT> of the Place unto which you mean to rectifie, which suppose to bee <IT>Oxford</IT>, therefore the <IT>Pole</IT> is to bee lifted up 51 Degrees, for that is the Elevation of this Place: then finde out <IT>Ox&rehy;ford</IT> in the <IT>Globe</IT>, and bring it to the <IT>Brass Meridian</IT>, and there staie it with a piece of paper, or the like, put between the <IT>Meridian</IT> and the <IT>Globe</IT>: And you have set before you <IT>Oxford</IT> with the verie same and all respects of <IT>Situation</IT> upon the <IT>Globe</IT>, as it hath upon the <IT>Earth</IT> it self.

<P>&Tic;Hese Terms of <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT> are understood ei&rehy;ther of the same or several Places. In the first sens they are absolutely called the <IT>Longitude</IT> or <IT>Latitude</IT> of this or that place. In the other sens wee use to say, The <IT>Difference of Longitude</IT> or <IT>Latitude</IT> between such and such a place. The <IT>Longitude</IT> of this or that place is the distance of it from the <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, to the <IT>Meridian</IT> of the Place reckoned in the Degrees of the <IT>Equator</IT>. The <IT>Latitude</IT> of a Place is the <IT>Di&rehy;stance</IT> of the <IT>Equator</IT> from the parallel of the place reckoned in the Degrees of the <IT>Meridian</IT>. Therefore if the place met with bee under the <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, it hath no <IT>Longitude</IT> at all, as the Hill in <IT>Tenariffe</IT>, unless it bee in respect of som other <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, as that by <IT>Corvo</IT>, or the other by S&tsup; <IT>Mi&rehy;cha&euml;l</IT>; and of such a place it will bee sufficient to know the <IT>Latitude</IT>. So again, if the place met with bee under the <IT>Equa&rehy;tor</IT>, it hath no <IT>Latitude</IT> at all; and of such a place it shall bee sufficient to know the <IT>Longitude</IT>. But if the place should fall out to bee in the verie <IT>Intersection</IT> it self of the <IT>Equator</IT>, and the <IT>Great Meridian</IT> it hath neither <IT>Latitude</IT> nor <IT>Longitude</IT>; and of such a Place it is sufficiently said, that <IT>There it is</IT>.
</P><P>But if the <IT>known Place</IT> lie at anie distance from the <IT>Equa&rehy;tor</IT>, it is but bringing it up to the <IT>Brass Meridian</IT>, and the <IT>Latitude</IT> is found by observing what Degrees the <IT>Meridian</IT> setteth off. Let <IT>Oxford</IT> bee the <IT>Place</IT> you meet with, turn the <IT>Globe</IT> till it lie precisely under the <IT>Meridian</IT>, and you will finde from the <IT>Equator</IT> 51 Degrees, 32 Minutes of <IT>Norther Latitude</IT>; and, by consequence, you also have the <IT>Elevation</IT> of the <IT>Pole</IT>: for that is alwaies equal to the <IT>Latitude</IT> of the <IT>Place</IT>.</P>
<P>With the same labor you may finde out the <IT>Longitude</IT>, if holding still the <IT>Globe</IT> you observ the Degrees of Interse<PB
N="288">ction cut off by the <IT>Meridian</IT> in the <IT>Equator</IT>: as put the case for <IT>Oxford </IT> still, it will bee found 22 Degrees from the <IT>For&rehy;tunate Islands</IT>, saith <IT>Camden</IT>; from S&tsup; <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT> in the <IT>Azores</IT> 'tis exactly true by which the <IT>Preface</IT> promised to go; but from the <IT>Fortunate Isles</IT> or the <IT>Pike</IT> in <IT>Tenariffe</IT>, not out 15.</P>
<P>In case anie of the <IT>lesser Meridians</IT> happen to pass through the Place, you may rekon of what number it is from the <IT>Great Meridian</IT>, as whether it bee the 3&dsup;, 5&thsup;, 9&thsup;, &amp;c. and so manie times 10 Degrees, (for at that distance they are set) is the <IT>Longitude</IT> of the Place. The same cours may bee taken by the <IT>Parallels</IT> to account the Degrees of <IT>Latitude</IT>.</P>
<P>And as the <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT> are found out by the <IT>Place known</IT>, so after the same manner anie <IT>Place</IT> may bee found out by the fore-knowledg of them. This fore-knowledg was first had by <IT>Observation</IT> of the <IT>Eclipses</IT> of the <IT>Moon</IT>, and the <IT>Meridian Altitude</IT> of the Sun or Stars, but may bee now more easily gotten out of the Tables of <IT>Peter Appian, Gem&rehy;ma Frisius, Mercator, Ortelius, Tycho</IT>, and that annexed to M&rsup; <IT>Hues</IT> his Treatise of the Use of the <IT>Globes</IT>, wherein the <IT>Longitudes</IT> and <IT>Latitudes</IT> of all the <IT>Principal Cities, Capes, Ri&rehy;vers</IT>, &amp;c. are set down, but not accounting all from the same <IT>Meridian</IT>, which therefore also must bee considered off: For the named Autors, <IT>Appian, Gemma Frisius</IT>, and <IT>Tycho</IT> reckoned from the <IT>Canaries</IT>, the rest from S&tsup; Micha&euml;l in the <IT>Azores</IT>.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Difference of Longitude and Latitude, and what is to bee observed in the con&rehy;verting of the Degrees of either into Miles</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Respect of several Places one to another, is called the <IT>Difference of Longitude</IT> or <IT>Latitude</IT>, as the <IT>Latitude</IT> of <IT>Oxford</IT> is 51 Degrees, the <IT>Latitude</IT> of <IT>Durham</IT> 55. The <IT>Difference of Latitude</IT> is 4 Degrees. The Use of <IT>Longitude</IT> and <IT>Latitude</IT>, in the absolute sens, was to make out the <IT>Position</IT> of anie <IT>Place</IT>, in respect of the <IT>Whole Sphere</IT>. In this other <PB
N="289">meaning, the Intent is to shew the <IT>Situation</IT> and <IT>Distance</IT> of anie Place from and in respect of anie other. The <IT>Situa&rehy;tion</IT> of a Place to another Place, is otherwise called the <IT>Angle of Position</IT>; but of the <IT>Distance</IT> first, and how that is to bee made into Miles.
</P><P>The several cases put by the <IT>Geographers</IT> of this <IT>Difference</IT>, are either of <IT>Places</IT> differing in <IT>Latitude</IT> onely, or <IT>Longitude</IT> onely, or both. Places differing in <IT>latitude</IT> onely, are all such as lie under the same <IT>Meridian</IT>, but <IT>several Parallels</IT>. This may so fall out, as that either both the Places may bee in <IT>North</IT>, or both in <IT>South Latitude</IT>, or one of them in <IT>each</IT>. If both the Places lie in <IT>North</IT> or <IT>South Latitude</IT>, then it is plain, that if the <IT>lesser Latitude</IT> bee subduced from the <IT>greater</IT>, the <IT>Re&rehy;manent</IT> of Degrees, multiplied into <IT>Miles</IT> by 60, sheweth the <IT>Distance</IT>, as the <IT>Isl' de Maio</IT> in the <IT>Latitude</IT> of 14 Degrees; and the Isle of S&tsup; <IT>Micha&euml;l</IT> 39 Degrees, are both under the <IT>same Meridian</IT>: the 14 Degrees are the <IT>lesser Latitude</IT>, which taken from the 39 the <IT>greater</IT>, the remainder is 25, which multiplied by 60, giveth the Distance in <IT>Miles</IT>. If one of the Places lie in <IT>North</IT>, the other in <IT>South Latitude</IT>, add the De&rehy;grees of both <IT>Latitudes</IT> together, and do the like.</P>
<P>The verie same Cours is to be taken, if the Places differ in <IT>Longitude</IT> onely, in case they both lie under the <IT>Line</IT> it self, becaus there the measure is in a <IT>Great Circle</IT>, as in the <IT>Meri&rehy;dians</IT> of <IT>Latitude</IT>; but if otherwise it fall out to be bee in anie <IT>Parallel</IT>, on this or that side of the <IT>Line</IT>, the case is altered.</P>
<P>Wee take for instance the Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt <IT>London</IT> and <IT>Charlton</IT>, or <IT>Charls-Town</IT>, in <IT>Charlton</IT> Island, so honored with the Name of <IT>CHARLS</IT> Prince of WALES, by Captain <IT>Thomas James</IT>, at his Attempt upon the <IT>North-West</IT> Passage in the <IT>Wintering</IT>, the 29&thsup; of <IT>Maie</IT>, the Year 1632, which was the Daie on His Highness Nati&rehy;vitie.</P>
<P>The Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> is 79 Degrees, 30 Minutes, as it was taken from an <IT>Eclips</IT> of the <IT>Moon</IT>, observed there by the Learned Captain, <IT>Octob.</IT> 29, 1631, and by M&rsub; <IT>Henrie Gellibrand</IT> at <IT>Gresham College</IT> at the same time. It is required that this Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> bee converted into <IT>Miles</IT>.</P>
<PB N="290"><P>The <IT>Latitude</IT> of <IT>Charlton</IT> is 52 Degrees, 3 Minutes; that of <IT>London</IT> much about the same. Here the proportion of 60 <IT>Miles</IT> to a Degree, will over-reckon the <IT>Distance</IT> almost by the half. The reason whereof shall bee first reported out of the Nature of the <IT>Sphere</IT>.
</P><P>However, it bee certain, that the <IT>Artificial Globe</IT> (as the <IT>Natural</IT> is supposed to bee is of a Form precisely round, and may bee drawn upon all over with <IT>Great Circles</IT> Meridional&rehy;ly, yet considered from the <IT>Middle Line</IT> to the <IT>Poles</IT>, it hath a sensible <IT>Inclination</IT> or <IT>Depression</IT> of <IT>Sphere</IT>, as it is termed in their words, so that if the <IT>Artificial Globe</IT> bee turned about upon it's <IT>Axel</IT>, several parts of the same Bodie shall bee more swiftly moved then other at the same time; for it is plain, that the <IT>Equator</IT> is moved about in the same duration of time, as the smallest <IT>Parallel</IT>, but the <IT>Circumferences</IT> are of a Vast and Visible Disproportion, and therefore is not pos&rehy;sible they should go an equal pace.</P>
<P>It is upon the same grounds, that the Author of the <IT>Use of the Globe <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Terram mobilem</FOREIGN></IT> will tell you, that in the Diur&rehy;nal Motion of the Earth, though <IT>Amsterdam</IT> (in the same <IT>Latitude</IT> with <IT>Oxford</IT>) keep pace with the Isle of S&tsup; <IT>Thomas</IT> under the <IT>Line</IT>, yet they are of a very different dispatch; for <IT>Amsterdam</IT> goeth but 548 Miles in an hour, whereas the Isle of S&tsup; <IT>Thomas</IT> posteth over 900 Miles in the same space of time, which is after the rate of 12 Miles in a Minute, and more. And all this is true (that is true to the <IT>Paradox</IT>) from the Inclination of the Sphere: But more plainly yet.</P>
<P>Wee see that the <IT>Meridians</IT> upon the <IT>Globe</IT> are set at 10 Degrees Distance, but wee may perceiv too that this Di&rehy;stance groweth less and less, as the <IT>Meridians</IT> draw nearer towards their concurrence in the <IT>Poles</IT>, as the <IT>Globe</IT> it self doth from the <IT>Equator</IT> upwards, and therefore the Degrees however accounted proportionable, yet cannot possibly bee equal in the Lesser <IT>Parallels</IT> to those in the <IT>Equator</IT>, but must needs make an orderlie Diminution from thence to either of the <IT>Poles</IT>.</P>
<P>When therefore it was formerly said that 60 Miles of the Surface of the <IT>Earthlie Globe</IT> answer to a degree in the <IT>Hea<PB
N="291">ven</IT>, it is to bee understood of the Degrees of a <IT>Great Circle</IT>, and so is alwaies true in those of <IT>Latitude</IT>, but in the De&rehy;grees of <IT>Longitude</IT> it holdeth onely in the <IT>Equator</IT> it self, but in the <IT>Parallels</IT> more North, or South the proportion diminisheth from 60 to none at all. So that if I would con&rehy;vert the <IT>Longitudes</IT> of the <IT>Molucca's</IT>, or anie other parts un&rehy;der the <IT>Line</IT> into Miles, it is but multiplying the Degrees of <IT>Longitude</IT> by 60 and the thing is don; but if I would do the like by <IT>Oxford</IT>, or anie other place betwixt the <IT>Equator</IT> and the <IT>Poles</IT>, I must first know what number of Miles answereth to a Degree in that <IT>Parallel</IT> of <IT>Latitude</IT>. The knowledg of this dependeth upon the proportion which the <IT>Equator</IT> beareth to the <IT>Parallels</IT>, which is learned out by the skill of <IT>Trigonometrie</IT>, but need not now bee so hardly attained to; for the Proportions are alreadie cast up into a <IT>Table</IT> by <IT>Peter Appian</IT> in the first Part of his <IT>Cosmographie</IT>. They are there set down according to the rate of <IT>German</IT> Miles, one of which maketh 4 of ours. According to our own Rate they are as followeth: </P>

To finde this out you are to ele&rehy;vate the <IT>Pole</IT> to the <IT>Latitude</IT> of one of the Places, then bring the Place to the <IT>Meridian</IT>, and it will fall out directly to bee in the <IT>Zenith</IT> of that <IT>Elevation</IT> upon this ground, That the <IT>Elevation</IT> is alwaies equal to the <IT>Latitude</IT>; then fasten the <IT>Qua&rehy;drant</IT> of <IT>Altitude</IT> upon the <IT>Zenith</IT>, and turn it about till it fall upon the other Place, and the End of the <IT>Quadrant</IT> will point out the Situation upon the <IT>Horizon</IT>. Let the Places bee <IT>Oxford</IT> and the Hill in <IT>Tenariff</IT>, set the <IT>Globe</IT> to the Elevati&rehy;on of <IT>Oxford</IT>, that is 51 Degrees of Elevation above the <IT>Horizon</IT>, then bring <IT>Oxford</IT> to the <IT>Meridian</IT>, and it falleth under 51 Degrees of <IT>Latitude</IT> from the <IT>Equator</IT>, therefore it is found in it's own <IT>Vertical Point</IT> 90 De&rehy;grees equidistantly removed from the <IT>Horizon</IT>: Fasten there the <IT>Quadrant</IT>, and move about the <IT>Plate</IT> till it fall upon the Hill in <IT>Tenariff</IT>, and the end of the <IT>Quadrant</IT> where it touch<PB
N="295">eth the <IT>Horizon</IT> will shew that the Hill in <IT>Tenariff</IT> beareth from <IT>Oxford</IT> South South-West: and if you multiplie <CORR
SIC="the the">the</CORR> Degrees of the <IT>Quadrant</IT> intercepted betwixt the two Places by 60, you have the Distance in Miles, which was pro&rehy;mised before.
</P><P>If you finde, as you needs must, that the Proportion of Miles upon the <IT>Globe</IT> doth not alwaies answer to that which wee reckon upon in the Earth, you are desired not to think much; for when it is promised that 60 of our Miles shall run out a Degree of a Great Circle above, it is inten&rehy;ded upon this Supposition, as if the Earth wee tread upon were precisely round as the <IT>Globe</IT> it self is, and not interrupted with Rivers, Hills, Vallies, &amp;c. which though they bear no proportion otherwise, yet becaus it cometh to pass by this that wee cannot set our cours in a Streight Line upon the Earth as the Demonstration is forced to presuppose, wee must bee contented if som difference fall out.</P>
<P>The more unhappie Difference will bee found in the <IT>Longitudes</IT> themselvs. The Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt <IT>Rome</IT> and <IT>Norenberg</IT> (as M. <IT>Gellibrand</IT> hath already made the Observation) is according <CORR
SIC="te">to</CORR> <IT>Kepler</IT>, but 4 Minutes of Time: <IT>Lansbergh</IT> reckoneth it at 10 Degrees, <IT>Mercator</IT> at 12, <IT>Stadius</IT> at 18, <IT>Longomontanus</IT> at 16, <IT>Stoffler</IT> at 18, <IT>Ma&rehy;ginus</IT> at 26, <IT>Werner</IT> at 32, <IT>Origan</IT> at 33, <IT>Appian</IT> at 34, <IT>Re&rehy;giomontanus</IT> at 36: with discouragement enough it may bee noted, for the Places are verie eminent, and of a near Di&rehy;stance: the Men professed able, and for the most part reckon&rehy;ing from the same Great <IT>Meridian</IT>; and yet the less to bee wondred at, if wee consider how much in this case must bee taken upon trust, even by these Men themselvs. Wee must not think they all spake this of their own Knowledg, for it is certain the thing might have been, and is don, though not without anie at all, yet without anie considerable dis&rehy;agreement. I saie the <IT>Longitudes</IT> for a very great part, are exact&rehy;ly enough agreed on. The perfection is not one Man's, nor one Ages Work, and must bee waited for. It must not seem strange if I tell you that you may distinguish the more certain from the doubtful by their disconvenience, for <PB
N="296">where you finde them to agree, you have caus to suspect (for the most part) that they have lien long upon the Lees of Time, not as yet enquired into. But if you finde them to disagree, you may conclude that they have been brought to a new Examination. And of these, you are to take the latest, and from such (if it may bee) as have don it by their own Observation, as out of the Tables of <IT>Tycho</IT> before others. The difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> by <IT>Tycho's</IT> Tables betwixt <IT>Rome</IT> and <IT>Norenberg</IT> is under 4 Degrees, which cometh nearest to <IT>Kepler</IT>, who also took it himself from two several observa&rehy;tions of the Moon. There will still seem to bee som want of satisfaction, but it is sufficient for anie man to know in this as much as anie other man doth.</P>
<P>If you would convert the Degrees of <IT>Longitude</IT> into Hours (for this also may bee don as well as into Miles) you are to allow 15 Degrees to one Hour, upon the Reasons taught before; and that which will bee gained by this is to know, by how much sooner or later the Sun Riseth, or Setteth to one Place then to another. As the Difference of <IT>Longitude</IT> betwixt <IT>Oxford</IT> and <IT>Charlton</IT> is 79 Degrees, 30 Mi&rehy;nutes: that is, 5 Hours, 18 Minutes: and becaus <IT>Charlton</IT> lieth West from <IT>London</IT>, the Sun Riseth so much sooner here then there.</P>

<P>&Tic;He <IT>Wisdom</IT> of the Antients (it was called so) held an Opinion that not our selvs onely, the <IT>Little Worlds</IT>, but the <IT>Great Globe</IT> of the <SC>Earth</SC> also is particu&rehy;larly reigned over by the Dominion of the 12 <IT>Signs</IT>, and Influence of the 7 <IT>Planets</IT>; upon which Principle (as wee receiv it by <IT>Ptolomie's</IT> Tradition) they divided this <IT>Globe</IT> into 4 <IT>Quadrants</IT> by the Intersection of the <IT>Equator</IT> with the Great <IT>Meridian</IT> passing by the <IT>Canaries</IT>. Every of these <IT>Qua&rehy;drants</IT> they again divided into 4 <IT>Trigons</IT>, consisting each of them of 3 <IT>Signs</IT> of the <IT>Zodiack</IT>, not orderly, but so as that everie <IT>Trigon</IT> night bee made up of one Fixt <IT>Sign</IT>, one Moveable, and the third Common, as they distinguish. The first <IT>Quadrant</IT> was reckoned from the <IT>Vernal</IT> by the <IT>Pole</IT> to the <IT>Autumnal Intersection</IT>, and was called the <IT>Quadrant</IT> of the <IT>Habitable World</IT>: for every one of the other three was to that Time a <FOREIGN

But this emptie Speculation stopped not here, but would make us believ too, that not Whole Countries onely, but everie Citie, Castle, Village, nay, not a private Hous, or a Ship that ride's upon the Oce&auml;n but is thus di&rehy;stinctly governed by their <IT>Planets</IT>. They do it upon this ground: Those men allow as earnest a livelihood to the Beam in the Timber, and Stone in the Wall as to themselvs. And when the first Stone of a Building is laid, a Citie or <PB

</P><P>The Emperor <IT>Constantine</IT> (though you would not think it) at the Building of his new <IT>Rome</IT> commanded <IT>Valens</IT>, (a named <IT>Astrologer</IT> of that Time) to Calculate the Nati&rehy;vitie, and make Judgment of the Life and Duration of that Imperial Citie. The <IT>Asscendent</IT> was <IT>Cancer</IT>, and the <IT>Astrologer</IT> said that the Empire should stand 696 years, and (whether hee knew so much or not) hee said true; the Citie lived longer indeed, but all the rest was but labor and sorrow.

Pre&rehy;pared thus, the <IT>Astrologers</IT> sit in Judgment upon the <IT>Inclina&rehy;tions</IT> and <IT>Fatalities</IT> of States and Men: and how little soever it may seem to us, or bee in it self, it was of moment to som of old, for <IT>Tiberius</IT> (an <IT>Astrologer</IT> himself) had the <IT>Genitures</IT> of all his Nobilitie by him, and according as hee found his own, or the Kingdom's <IT>Horoscope</IT> to bee well, or ill look't upon by theirs, so hee let them stand, or cut them off by <IT>Legislative Astrologie</IT>.</P>
