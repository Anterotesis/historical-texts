The following <IT>Experiment</IT> being of considerable Impor&rehy;tance, as serving to determine several Difficulties in the <IT>Natural History of Rains, Vapours, &amp;c.</IT> and being likewise very easily try&rehy;ed, it is desired it may be done with Care and Exactness in all Parts of the World. Get some <IT>Vessel</IT> either of Copper, Wood, or Earth, about 2. Foot wide, (or if wider the better) and at least a Foot and half deep; be sure it be <IT>firm</IT> and <IT>sound</IT>, and that it do not <IT>leak</IT> in the least. Fill it about 3/4 full of <IT>Water</IT>: Cover it over with a <IT>Net</IT>, or very thin fine <IT>Wier-grate</IT>, to keep off <IT>Birds</IT>, or other Creatures from drinking the Water; and then set it <IT>forth</IT>, either upon the <IT>Leads</IT> of some flat-roof't House, or in the midst of a Garden, or some other fit Place, where the <IT>Sun</IT> may shine upon it <IT>all Day</IT> from Sun-rising to Sun-setting, or at least as much as may be.

This Experiment ought to be <IT>continued</IT> thus for <IT>one whole Year</IT> at least, but longer if possible; only during the Time of <IT>Frost</IT>, no Observation need be made, the Water in the Vessel then neither rising nor falling.</P>

</ITEM></LIST><P>It would be of incredible <IT>advantage</IT> to this Design, were <IT>all</IT> the <IT>Thermometers</IT> and <IT>Hygrobaroscopes</IT> used in it adjusted nicely and ex&rehy;actly after some <IT>one common Standard</IT>. Which would be a Thing very easie to be done, were they all <IT>bought</IT> of the <IT>same Person</IT>. Nor can I, if I may presume to recommend one for this purpose, nominate a fitter than Mr. <IT>Hunt, Operator</IT> to the <IT>Royal Society</IT> at <IT>Gresham College</IT>; who will not only procure the two mentioned, (graduated very carefully) or indeed any of the other Instruments, but likewise be ready to <IT>direct</IT> any one, who shall desire it, in the method of <IT>using</IT> them; or to <IT>advise</IT> and <IT>assist</IT> them in any o&rehy;ther thing tending to the promoting of this <IT>Design</IT>. For the <IT>Ther&rehy;mometers</IT>, were they thus all of them, adjusted to the same <IT>Stan&rehy;dard</IT>, (to be kept constantly in the <IT>Repository</IT> at <IT>Gresham College</IT>, where any Man might have recourse to it) 'twere easie to make a true and <IT>certain Estimate</IT> of the <IT>Heat</IT> or <IT>Cold</IT> in any part of the World where these <IT>Thermometers</IT> were used, for they would all of them constantly <IT>answer to one another</IT>, in what Country soever they were. By this means the Heat or Cold of all Places in the <IT>same Climate</IT> or under the same Latitude may be compared and known, for any, or all, Seasons of the Year. The same way may a comparative judgment be made of the Heat or Cold of <IT>Climates</IT> tho never so <IT>different</IT> and distant: the Heat of <IT>one Countrey</IT> or Place may be <IT>conferred</IT> with <IT>another</IT>; of <IT>one Mine, Cole-pit, Grotto</IT>, or other <IT>Subterranean Cavern</IT>, with <IT>another</IT>: the temperature of <IT>Valleys</IT> or <IT>Plains</IT> with that of <IT>higher Ground</IT>, and with the sides or Tops of <IT>Mountains</IT>; which would be a thing of real and very <IT>great use</IT> in many respects. So likewise for the <IT>Hygrobaroscopes</IT>: were they all ad&rehy;justed after the same Standard, there would be a fixt and <IT>standing Rule</IT> whereby to judge of the <IT>Gravity</IT> of <IT>Fluids</IT> all over the World where<PB
N="20">ever these Instruments were used. The Gravity of the <IT>Water</IT> of <IT>one Sea</IT> might be <IT>compared</IT> with that of <IT>another</IT>: of the <IT>Northern</IT> with the <IT>Southern Seas</IT>: of the Seas under the <IT>&AElig;quinoctial</IT>, with those at the <IT>Poles</IT>. So also of <IT>different parts</IT> of the <IT>same Sea</IT>, the <IT>Shores</IT> with the <IT>Main</IT>, or the <IT>Waters</IT> of the very <IT>same place</IT>, taken up at <IT>different depths</IT>, with each other. In the same manner may be examined the <IT>Water</IT> of <IT>Lakes</IT>, of <IT>Rivers</IT>, of <IT>Mines, Cole&rehy;Pits, &amp;c.</IT> of <IT>Springs</IT> of all Sorts, both the <IT>Mineral</IT> ones and <IT>others</IT>, all over the World.</P>
