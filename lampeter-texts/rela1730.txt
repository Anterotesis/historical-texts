<P>&Tic;HE Erecting of a <IT>Play-House</IT> in the Neighbourhood obliges me to warn this Congregation of the great Evil and Danger in Frequent&rehy;ing them: So that though there are many Vices in Conversation, which this Text adviseth us to avoid, I shall at present only apply the same to the <IT>publick Actings</IT> of the <IT>Stage</IT> in <IT>Comedies</IT> and <IT>Tragedies</IT>, and other Diversions of the same Na&rehy;ture, and endeavour to shew, That we ought to <IT>shun</IT> those <IT>profane and vain bablings</IT>, since a long Experience doth fully convince us, that <IT>they</IT> do <IT>increase unto more ungodliness</IT>.
</P><P>In order to this it may be thought requisite, that I should prove these Diversions to be <IT>profane and vain bablings</IT>. But since this is as evident, as that the Sun shines at Noon-Day, since none in this Age deny it, except Persons of lewd Morals, and a reprobate Sense, I think, the Matter too no&rehy;torious to be at this Time insisted on, and only desire such, who doubt the Truth hereof, that <PB
N="4">they would seriously peruse <IT>the View of the Immo&rehy;rality and Profaneness of the</IT> English <IT>Stage, with the Sense of Antiquity on this Argument</IT>. <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><IT>By</IT> Jeremiah Collier.</NOTE> And also a smaller Treatise, entituled, <IT>A Representation of the Impiety and Immorality of the</IT> English <IT>Stage, with Reasons for Putting a Stop thereto, and some Questions address'd to those, who frequent the Play&rehy;Houses</IT>, or some others of those many Treatises which have been since published on the same Sub&rehy;jects; in the Perusal of which they may be fully satisfied, That the Misbehaviour of the <IT>Stage</IT>, in Respect to Morality and Religion, is intolerable, and it doth far exceed the Examples of the for&rehy;mer, and even of the Heathen Ages and Poets, and the Liberties, which they take, are often offensive to the Profession of <IT>Christianity</IT>, which plainly appears from their <IT>lewd and filthy Communication</IT>, their <IT>Swear&rehy;ing, Cursing, Blasphemy, Profaneness, and lewd Ap&rehy;plication of Scripture</IT>; their <IT>Abuse of the Clergy</IT>, to make the Religion, which they profess, vile and contemptible; and also their <IT>Giving great Cha&rehy;racters to Libertines</IT>, or Persons who scruple no Vice or Immorality, and Bringing them off with Honour and Success: How a fine <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Collier's <IT>View of the Stage, Page</IT> 143.</NOTE> Gentle&rehy;man is a whoring, swearing, cursing, smutty, atheistical Man. These Qualifications serve to compleat the Idea of Honour, and are the top Improvements of Fortune, and the distinguishing Glories of Birth and Breeding; and when all this is added to bold and daring Attempts after rich Fortunes, they are rewarded according to their Wishes, and instruct the Audience how to carry on the same Intreagues to the Ruin of other Fami&rehy;lies. In short, their Actions are chiefly designed <PB
N="5">to gratify such Persons, as are of vicious and de&rehy;bauched Principles, who <IT>fear not GOD, and re&rehy;gard not man</IT>; since it is generally from such, that they have their Wealth. Hence it is, that their Poets seldom scruple to speak Blasphemy, rather than lose a Fancy, and to affront their GOD, whilst they adore their Mistress. Hence it is, that they look upon the Regulating the Play-Houses, and Keeping them within the Bounds of Modesty and Religion, to be the greatest Persecution, and which would in the End prove the Suppressing of them. For as they have given a just Scandal to good Men; so if they had not such Acts and Expressions, which will please the bad, they must fall at once, and Necessity will compel them to take other Employments. I shall not therefore spend any Time in Proving these Things to be <IT>profane and vain bablings</IT>, but endeavour to shew you the Reasons which should induce us to avoid them, and especially that which is mentioned in the Text; because, if they are encouraged, <IT>they will increase un&rehy;to more ungodliness</IT>.</P>
<P>To this End let us first consider <IT>the Precepts</IT> and <IT>Examples of the Primitive Christians</IT>. It is <NOTE
N="(c)" PLACE="foot" REND="it"><RO>Collier's</RO> View of the Stage, from Page 250 to Page 276.</NOTE> very remarkable, that the <IT>ancient Fathers</IT> have spoken most fully, against the <IT>Plays</IT>, which were used both in <IT>Rome</IT> and <IT>Greece</IT>; and, if we did quote all, which hath been said by them upon this Subject, we must transcribe a great Part of their Works, since they have written particular <IT>Books</IT>, as well as <IT>Homilies</IT> or <IT>Sermons</IT>, upon this Occasion. <IT>Lactan&rehy;tius</IT> <NOTE
N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Lactantius, <IT>lib.</IT> 6. <IT>cap.</IT></FOREIGN> 20.</NOTE> wondered at the Practice of the <IT>Heathen Philosophers</IT>, who were present at the Actings of such <IT>publick Interludes</IT>, and saith, That <Q
REND="it">because <PB N="6">they are the publick Allurements of Vices, and do so effectually prevail to the Corrupting of Men's Minds, they ought to be suppressed; especially because they are not only unprofitable in Bringing us to Heaven, but are also very pernicious in Sending us to Hell.</Q> And in <NOTE
N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Lactantius, <IT>lib.</IT> 6. <IT>cap.</IT></FOREIGN> 21.</NOTE> another Place he asks this Question, <Q
REND="it">Who would not look upon that Man to be very wanton and wicked, who did suffer such Acts in his own House?</Q> And then he adds, That <Q
REND="it">there is no Difference, whether we are guilty of Lasciviousness alone at Home, or encourage it by Frequenting the same pub&rehy;lickly in the Theater.</Q> <IT>St. Cyprian</IT> <NOTE
N="(f)" PLACE="foot" REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cyprianus in Epi&rehy;stol&acirc; ad Donatum.</NOTE> saith, That <Q
REND="it">Adultery is learned, whilst these things are seen; and the chast Matron, who goes to behold such Sights, returns Home with a corrupt and debauched Mind.</Q> Here (saith he) <Q
REND="it">Wickedness is beheld most willingly and with Delight. What then cannot such Actions persuade others to do?</Q> And therefore he adviseth us to <Q
REND="it">consider, Whether a Person can be ei&rehy;ther innocent or modest, who is present at such Things?</Q></P>
<P>And as the <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Dr.</IT> Cave's <IT>Primitive Christianity, Book</IT> 2. <IT>Chap.</IT> 2. <IT>Page</IT> 32.</NOTE> <IT>Primitive Christians</IT> did con&rehy;stantly urge the Necessity of Abstaining from these <IT>Plays</IT>; so such, as owned themselves <IT>Christians</IT>, did as conscientously follow their Advice. They went not to the publick <IT>Games</IT>, nor frequented the <IT>Shows</IT>, which were made for the Diversion and Entertain&rehy;ment of the People; and this was so publickly known that the Heathens charged it upon them as a Crime. <IT>C&aelig;cilius</IT> in <IT>Minutius F&aelig;lix</IT> <NOTE
N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Pag.</IT> 34, Oxford <IT>Edition</IT>.</NOTE> com&rehy;plains thus, That <Q
REND="it">the <RO>Romans</RO> governed and en&rehy;joyed the World, whilst the <RO>Christians</RO> in the mean time were careful and mopish. They abstained from <PB
N="7">such Pleasures, they visited not the Shows, nor were present at the Pomps. They frequented not the pub&rehy;lick Feasts, but abhorred all such Diversions.</Q> This <IT>Octavius</IT>, the <IT>Christian</IT>, granted to be <IT>true</IT>, when he pleaded their Defence, and said in Answer to this Charge, That <NOTE
N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Page</IT> 106.</NOTE> <Q REND="it">since they were endued with Mode&rehy;sty and Sobriety, they had just Cause to abstain from those evil Pleasures, their Pomps and Shows, and to condemn them as hurtful Allurements.</Q> And he gives this Reason, <Q
REND="it">because in those Acts and scenical Representations their filthy Communication is as great as their Madness, whilst the Actors speaking of Adulteries incite them, and the Stage-Players by De&rehy;scribing of Lust do inflame their Hearers.</Q> In short, <NOTE
N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Dr.</IT> Cave's <IT>Primitive Christianity, Part</IT> 2. <IT>Chap.</IT> 2. <IT>Page</IT> 32.</NOTE> they thought, they could not be present at these Plays without great Sin and Shame, without Af&rehy;fronting their Modesty, and Offering a Distaste and Horrour to their Minds. They look'd upon the publick Sports and Pastimes of those Days, as the Scenes not only of Folly and Lewdness, but of great Impiety and Idolatry, as Places where the Devil eminently ruled, and reckoned those to be his Votaries, who went thither.</P>
<P>And as they thought it a great Crime to be present at such Sports; so they looked upon it as contrary to their <IT>Baptismal Vow</IT>. At the Time when Persons were baptized, they were <NOTE
N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Constitutiones Apostolic&aelig;</FOREIGN>, <IT>lib.</IT> 7. <IT>cap.</IT> 42. <IT>pag.</IT> 993.</NOTE> among others asked these two Questions, <Q
REND="it">Dost thou re&rehy;nounce the Devil, and all his Works, Powers, and Services? And dost thou renounce the World, and all its Pomps and Pleasures?</Q> And to each of these Questions the Party answered, saying, <Q
REND="it">I do re&rehy;nounce them.</Q> And each of these Questions they supposed to be directly levelled against the Thea<PB
N="8">ters. St. <IT>Cyril</IT> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Cyrillus Hierosolym. <IT>Catech. Myst. Vol.</IT></FOREIGN> 1. <IT>Page</IT> 510.</NOTE> expounding the Word <IT>Pomps</IT> (the Word which we still use in our Baptism, in a Question of the same Nature) expresly tells us, that thereby is meant <IT>The Sights and Sports of the publick Stage</IT>. Those <NOTE
N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Dr.</IT> Bray <IT>on the Church-Catechism, Sect.</IT> 19.</NOTE> <IT>pompous Spectacles, Plays, and scenical Representations</IT> exhibited in the <IT>Roman</IT> and <IT>Grecian Theaters</IT>, which, because they were so lewd, cruel, and impious, it was an early Cus&rehy;tom for the <IT>primitive Bishops</IT> and <IT>Fathers</IT> of the <IT>Church</IT>, in their Discourses to the <IT>baptized Persons</IT>, strictly to enjoin them not to frequent, or so much as once to be present or seen at such Places. They reckoned <NOTE
REND="it" N="(o)" PLACE="foot">It <CORR SIC="may may">may</CORR> be observed from St. <RO>Cyril,</RO> that the Word <RO>Pompa </RO>is used to signify the <RO>Acts </RO>of the Stage, tho' that is not its only Meaning. It may also be observed, that the Word was used in this Sense both by <RO>Heathens </RO>and <RO>Christians.</RO> The <RO>Heathen </RO>in <RO>Minutius F&aelig;lix </RO>charged the <RO>Christians </RO>with this pretended Crime, <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Non Pompis in&rehy;terestis</FOREIGN>; and the <RO>Christians </RO>confessed the Charge, saying <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">merit&ograve; malis voluptatibus, & Pompis vestris, & Spectaculis abstinemus</FOREIGN>. And therefore as the Word <RO>Pomps </RO>is expresly used in our Renuncia&rehy;tion at Baptism, and in our Church-Catechism; as also we ratify and confirm the same in our own Persons at Confirmation, and as the Word is of a <RO>Greek </RO>Original; so, I think, that there is Reason to take it according to the Sense of a <RO>Greek </RO>Father, and not confine it only to the Sense, in which the <RO>Latins </RO>often used it.</NOTE> all those <IT>Pomps</IT> as <IT>Allurements</IT> to <IT>Vice</IT>, and those <IT>Houses</IT> as so many <IT>Synagogues</IT> of <IT>Satan</IT>, and consequently, that by <IT>Renouncing the World and the Devil</IT> they also renounced them. Ac&rehy;cordingly <IT>Tertullian</IT> tells us <NOTE
REND="it" N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Lib. de Spectaculis</FOREIGN>. Page 701. Edit. Basil 1562.</NOTE> of a <Q
REND="it">Christian Wo&rehy;man, who, going to the Theater, was there possessed by the Devil; and when the evil Spirit at his Casting out was asked, How he durst set upon a Christian? he presently answered, I did but what was fit and just, for I found her upon my own Ground.</Q> Neither is this the only Instance, which <PB
N="9">he there mentions, but he saith, that <Q REND="it">there are other Examples of those, who, while they held Communion with the Devil by Frequenting those Shews, did at the same Time fall away from the Faith.</Q> And then he adds, <Q
REND="it">For no Man can serve two Masters. What Communion hath Light with Darkness? And what Fellowship hath Life with Death? We ought <RO>(saith he)</RO> to hate those Meetings and Assemblies of the Heathen, because there the Name of GOD is blasphemed.</Q> And after this he expostulates thus with those in his Time, <Q
REND="it">Do you doubt but that in the Minute, in which you shall be present at the Synagogue of Satan, all the Angels do look down from Heaven, and behold every one who speaks the Blas&rehy;phemy, and who hears it, who lends a Tongue, and who lends an Ear to the Devil to be employed against GOD? Will you not therefore avoid that Seat of the Enemies of CHRIST, that infectious Chair, and that Air, which is polluted with such wicked and profane Discourse?</Q> And therefore since our <IT>mo&rehy;dern Plays</IT>, which are acted in those Houses, are no less inferiour to the <IT>ancient</IT> Ones in <IT>Impiety</IT> and <IT>Lewdness</IT> than they are in <IT>Show</IT> and <IT>Pomp</IT>; we may suppose, that those <IT>ancient Fathers</IT>, if they had lived in our Days, would have expressed their Resentments now, in the same Language which they did then. Since they have such a malignant Influence upon Faith and Manners, (as it is own&rehy;ed almost by all Persons, and as it is generally complained that they have) they may be reckoned among the Works of the <IT>Devil</IT>, as well as those of former Ages, and therefore ought not to be en&rehy;couraged by such, who call themselves <IT>Christians</IT>. And since we also have been <IT>baptized</IT>, and have promised to <IT>Renounce the Devil and all his Works</IT>, as well as <IT>the vain Pomps and Vanities of this wick&rehy;ed World, and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh, so <PB
N="10">that we will not follow, nor be led by them</IT>; we ought, as they did, to consider the Nature of our <IT>Baptismal Vow</IT>, and <NOTE
N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Prov. ii.17.</NOTE> beware, lest we break that <IT>Covenant</IT>, which we so solemnly made <IT>with our</IT> GOD.</P>
<P>That this is our present Case may be abun&rehy;dantly seen in many Books and Treatises, which have been printed on this Subject; among which I shall only mention one of the greatest Rank among us, which is Archbishop <IT>Tillotson</IT>, who in <NOTE
REND="it" N="(r)" PLACE="foot">In his third Sermon concerning the Education of Children, Page 220. First Edition.</NOTE> one <IT>Sermon</IT> calls the <IT>Play-House</IT> the <Q
REND="it">Devil's Chapel</Q>, and <Q REND="it">the School and Nursery of Lewdness and Vice</Q>. And in another <NOTE
N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Vol.</IT> 11, <IT>Page</IT> 319,320,321.</NOTE> he saith, that <Q
REND="it">the Plays do intrench upon natural Modesty, and for that Reason are forbidden and condemned by the Christian Religion; and (as they are now ordered among us) are a mighty Reproach to the Age and Nation. <RO>That</RO> they are intolerable, and not fit to be permitted in a civilized, much less in a <RO>Christian</RO> Nation, and that they do most notoriously minister both to Infidelity and Vice. By the Profaneness of them they are apt to instil bad Principles into the Minds of Men, and to lessen that Awe and Reverence, which all Men ought to have for GOD and Religion. And by their Lewdness they teach Vice, and are apt to infect the Minds of Men, and dispose them to lewd and dissolute Practices. And therefore <RO>(as he adds)</RO> I do not see how any Person, pretending to Sobriety and Virtue, and espe&rehy;cially to the pure and holy Religion of our blessed SAVIOUR, can without great Guilt, and open Con&rehy;tradiction to his holy Profession, be present at such lewd and immodest Plays, much less frequent them, as too many do, who yet would take it very ill to be <PB
N="11">shut out of the Communion of <RO>Christians</RO>; as they would most certainly have been in the first and purest Ages of <RO>Christianity</RO>.</Q></P>
<P>And now let us consider the Reason, which the <IT>Apostle</IT> urgeth in the Text. If we should encou&rehy;rage this Evil, it will make Way for more: And, if we do not <IT>shun</IT> these <IT>profane and vain bablings, they will increase unto more ungodliness</IT>. In vain do we pretend to a <IT>Reformation of Manners</IT> and a <IT>Re&rehy;gulation of our Youth</IT>, when such Temptations lie in their Way, which, if frequented, will certain&rehy;ly debauch them. In this Case we must expect that Youth will follow what is most agreeable to their corrupt Inclinations; and whilst the Temp&rehy;tations are equally strong on either Side, and the Heart of Man is fully set in him to do Evil, we cannot but expect, that the Consequences hereof will be fatal to some, and that the <IT>Devil</IT> will not be wanting to make Use of such Opportunities to tempt Men to Sin, until they are involved in eter&rehy;nal Destruction. The sad Experience hereof made <IT>Menander</IT>, a Heathen <IT>Poet</IT>, to say, That <IT>evil Com&rehy;munications do corrupt good Manners</IT>; which was so certain and true, that it became a <IT>Proverb</IT> in <IT>Greece</IT>, and was afterward assented to by St. <IT>Paul</IT>, who inserts the same into the <IT>holy Scriptures</IT> with a particular Caution of his own, lest we should be deceived by such Insinuations. And therefore it may not be amiss to suppose, that St. <IT>Paul</IT>, di&rehy;recting his Epistle to <IT>Timothy</IT> at <IT>Ephesus</IT>, where the <IT>Comedies</IT> of <IT>Aristophanes</IT> were frequently acted, might have a particular Reference to these Enor&rehy;mities, when he advised him to <IT>shun profane and vain bablings</IT>, because <IT>they</IT> would <IT>increase unto more ungodliness</IT>: And indeed we there find the Effects thereof, for <NOTE
N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Strabo <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Geogr. lib.</FOREIGN> 14. <IT>pag.</IT> 41.</NOTE> their Manners were <IT>loose</IT> and <IT>pro&rehy;fligate, wanton</IT>, and <IT>effeminate</IT>; and they had an In&rehy;junction in their common Discourse, <IT>Let none of ours be thrifty</IT>. And if this was the Case in a City, where they could hardly be worse, what Degene&rehy;racy must be expected in a Place professing <IT>Christi&rehy;anity</IT>, and making, at least, some Show of Reli&rehy;gion?</P>
<P>But it is not sufficient to speak of the Increase of Ungodliness in general; and therefore I shall mention some particular Vices, which seem, in a great Measure, to be the Effects of our present Stage and their Actings.</P>
<P>The first is, The Profaning of GOD's Name by <IT>Swearing, Cursing</IT>, and <IT>Blasphemy</IT>. The In&rehy;crease of this Vice is most amazing, and no one that walks the Streets is sure, that he shall not hear People calling upon GOD to <IT>damn</IT> and <IT>con&rehy;found</IT>, sometimes themselves, and sometimes others, and more particularly that the <IT>Plague</IT> may rot them. There are innumerable and intolerable Ex&rehy;amples of these Sorts in our modern Plays, as they have been fully exposed by later Authors; and these are spoken as Patterns for the <IT>Bullies</IT> of the Age to imitate. The Disappointments in <IT>Come&rehy;dies</IT> are never thought to be sufficiently express'd, nor the Passions in <IT>Tragedies</IT> to be sufficiently rais'd, until their Resentments are mixed with such hellish Language. Neither are they contented with such as are more common, because it looks as if they had not Wit enough to affront GOD more effectu&rehy;ally than their Neighbours; but they are daily inventing a continual Variety of this Nature, as if the <IT>Play-House</IT> was only a Forge to hammer out new Pieces of Armour, whereby to rebel against GOD, and bid him Defiance. They who hear them with Delight soon learn them, and afterward use them in other Places; and thus like Persons sick <PB
N="13">of the Plague (which they often call for) they carry the Infection from Place to Place, and so it overspreads the Nation.</P>
<P><IT>Secondly, Murthers</IT> are often the Effects of the <IT>Stage</IT>. Many of our modern <IT>Tragedies</IT> are de&rehy;signed to shew the Success of such, who think their Wills to be a Law, who hector at, quarrel with, fight and destroy all before them. To these it is that the Actors pay Respect, give them great Ti&rehy;tles, admire their Courage, and praise their Vices, instead of Virtues. Such Sights, Bloodshed, and Murther, being shewn on a Stage, do by De&rehy;grees occasion the Spectators to be cruel and outrageous; and Men do there learn to be <IT>inhu&rehy;man</IT>. Such Persons, who are in the Heat of Youth, and are of a proud and passionate Tem&rehy;per, immediately think, that they may act the same Parts upon the publick Stage of the World, and come off with the same Success, until they are convinced of their Error, when perhaps it is too late. And it is very observable, that the great&rehy;est Persecutions, which were ever raised against the <IT>Christians</IT>, were began and carried on in <IT>Heathen Rome</IT>, where they had their <IT>Theaters</IT>, and their <IT>Tragedies</IT> were most frequently acted. This made them more cruel and delight in Bloodshed, inso&rehy;much that, at last, the Martyrdom of the Saints be&rehy;came their Diversion, and <IT>Christians</IT> were in Rea&rehy;lity brought forth, and devoured by wild Beasts, to make Pastime for those, who had pleased them&rehy;selves with such Resemblances. And since the Reformation it is as remarkable, that the most dread&rehy;ful Persecutions against the Protestants, and all their Designs to destroy our Religion, have either been begun, or, at least, carried on and promoted by that City. This is the <IT>great Whore</IT>, who hath been diverted by the <IT>Theaters, Carnivals</IT> and <IT>Ju<PB
N="14">bilees</IT>; and, as she was addicted to such Sports and Pastimes, it may be the less wondered at, that in all Ages she hath made herself so <IT>drunk with the Blood of the Saints</IT>. And even, among our&rehy;selves, it will be difficult to find one Instance of a Challenge or a Duel, except among such, whose Spirits have been warmed by being present at such a Furnace as this. But, having seen such Things in jest, they lose their Lives in earnest.</P>
<P><IT>Thirdly, Adulteries</IT> and <IT>Whoredoms</IT> are the com&rehy;mon Effects of the <IT>Stage</IT>. In one of our <IT>Plays</IT> <NOTE

For a Man may step into the <IT>Play-House</IT> Passage, and pick up Half-a-dozen for Half-a-crown.</Q></NOTE> an Actor boasts, that this Effect is so visible in their Neighbourhood, that their Hearers can&rehy;not fail of Opportunities for such a Purpose. And indeed the notorious Immodesty, both in Words and Actions, which are there both heard and seen, the filthy Songs which are there sung, and the <IT>Musick</IT> framed by the Composers with such Notes, as will most affect the Passions, are but as so many Temptations to Lust, and serve only to instruct the Hearers, how to carry on their own filthy Designs, that so, at their Departure thence in a mix'd Company, they may go (if possible) to a worse Place, and be the real Actors of what was thus represented. Neither do the Effects stop here. These Songs are taught to young Ladies to sing, before they are sensible what they mean, and so the Parents pay for the Ruin of their own Chil&rehy;dren. Thus they learn Love-Songs, and such as are frequently intermix'd with Smut, and even Mo&rehy;tives to Lust: These they are obliged frequently to repeat, before they can learn them, and the <IT>Musician</IT> seldom fails to set the worst Part off to <PB
N="15">the greatest Advantage; sometimes by a frequent Repetition of the Words, sometimes by Affecting Divisions, and always by such soft Notes, which, they too well know, will work upon that Passion. This of course makes them wanton, and so they think of Husbands, before they are capable to choose for themselves. Thus they are soon en&rehy;snared to gratify their Passions, by others who on&rehy;ly catch at their Fortunes; and are often tempt&rehy;ed to worse Acts, which prove the Ruin of them&rehy;selves, and the Sorrow of their Parents. Thus our noble Science of Musick is debased, and, like Cannon taken by the Enemy, is directly levelled against the first Proprietor. It was, at first, in&rehy;tended in the Church of GOD to set forth his Glory both in publick and private, and be a Help to us in our Way to Heaven; but, instead of this ancient Design, it is abused to his Dishonour, and there is very little private Use made of it, un&rehy;less it is to debauch Mens's Morals, to heighten their Lusts, and send them directly into the Road to Hell. Good Men may wish, and pray, and endeavour for a Regulation; but it must be an over-ruling Providence which can effect it, and to him alone in such a Case must the Glory be given.</P>
<P><IT>Fourthly, Idleness</IT> is the common Effect of the <IT>Stage</IT>. It is with great Difficulty, that Youth are kept to Labour and Industry; and therefore all Temptations to the contrary are prejudicial. But, when such leave their Callings to go to the Plays, it is but seldom, that the Masters have any Com&rehy;mand of those who are under them. They have a strange Inclination to go thither again and again; and so all necessary Business shall be neglected to gratify their Fancy. Besides, it is usually late, before the <IT>Plays</IT> are ended, and, if the Company <PB
N="16">is large, the Heat of the Place will make them thirsty. This exposeth them to go to <IT>Taverns</IT> and <IT>Alehouses</IT>, and then it is so much the later, before they return Home. By this Means Families are disordered, and forced to keep unseasonable Hours, and therefore they cannot be so early about their lawful Callings. After this, such Youth think themselves too good to be confined, and grow weary of the Station, in which GOD hath placed them. Thus the Principles of Idleness and Extravagancy are strangely infused into such People, as resort to these Places, which often tend to their utter Ruin. This may be an Argument to persuade all Trades&rehy;men and Shopkeepers to restrain their Children, Servants, and Apprentices. If they are suffered to go thither, they will be apt to frequent them; and, if they have no Money of their own for such a Purpose, they will be apt, as Occasion requires, to steal it from their Parents and Masters, which being done by little and little, it may be long before it is missed in the Way of Trade, and after that it will be impossible to know how much they have been injured.</P>
<P><IT>Fifthly, Contempt of all Religion</IT> is too often the Effect of the Stage. As such Persons seldom scruple to speak the most horrid Blasphemies, as a Diversion and Entertainment to their Company; so we cannot expect, that they, who are delighted with such Things, can be reckoned Men, who have any Sense of the Honour of GOD, or Fear of his Judg&rehy;ments. Nothing is more common here for such, than to affront their Maker, and make a Goddess of their Mistress, to think of no Heaven, except in her Company, and no Hell, but to be kept from her. This and much more, which one would tremble to relate, is the Language of the Play&rehy;House, and indeed some of the best. An Author <PB

If then our Prisons are filled with Persons for capital Crimes: If our Roads are infested with Robbers abroad, and our Streets with others near&rehy;er home: If Tradesmen cannot stir out for Fear of being knock'd down, and their Goods cannot be safe in their own Shops, it must be allowed, that the Poets, Actors, and Audience have given the greatest Encouragement to all these Misfortunes, and have done their utmost to shock the Autho&rehy;rity of the Laws, which are made to restrain them, and render the Punishments inflicted in those Cases as most contemptible.</P>
<P>Since therefore these <IT>profane and vain bablings</IT> do (as the Text saith) <IT>increase unto more ungodli&rehy;ness</IT>; this should exhort all such, who pretend to a Sense of Religion, or Love to their own Souls, to avoid them.

Now if we are afraid of a Disease, which will only kill the Body; how much more should we fear that Contagion, which, if not prevented, will <IT>destroy both body and soul in hell</IT>? Let us re&rehy;member the Charge, which GOD gives us in the Text, and not only there, but also in other Places of <IT>Scripture</IT>. Thus it is <IT>Eph.</IT> v.11,12. <Q

REND="it">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away; For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, except they cause some to fall. For they eat the bread of violence, and drink the wine of deceit.</Q> And <IT>Psalm.</IT> i.1,2. <Q
REND="it">Blessed is the man, that hath not walked in the cou&rehy;nsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sate in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the <RO>LORD</RO>, and in his law will be mediate both day and night.</Q> If these Places were not frequented, they would fall of course; and, when the Hope of their Gains was <PB
N="27">gone, they might betake themselves to some re&rehy;putable Method for a Livelihood. However, if some Men should be so obstinate and refractory, as to take no wholesome Advice in this Case; yet, one would think, that such <IT>Women</IT>, who have any Regard to their Reputation, will shun those Places. One would think, that such filthy Discourse would be very affronting in Conversation, and not to be endured by any young <IT>Lady</IT>, who values her Cre&rehy;dit. And one would think it strange, that such Liberties, which they would justly resent in pri&rehy;vate Conversation, should entertain and please them on the publick Stage. In short, their Going thither seems to be no other than Spending their Mo&rehy;ney to hear themselves abused, and their Modesty af&rehy;fronted; and in such Case it is much better to stay at Home. To suppose that such can like it, is a gross Reflection on their Virtue; and therefore it may rather be hoped, that they will take Care not to expose themselves. To sit contentedly and hear a Parcel of such lewd, wanton, and smutty Discourse, both in Prose and Verse: To see such Plots and Contrivances carried on both for Whoredom and Adultery without Detestation, makes the Rakes of the Town think, that these are as bad as themselves, and that it is not a Sense of the Sin, but rather of some temporal Inconveni&rehy;encies, or Want of Opportunity, which restains them from Committing the like. This exposeth them to such Adresses, which they themselves abhor; and then, being afraid wherever they go, they wish too late, that they had never given the Occasion.</P>
<P><IT>Lastly</IT>, Let us all be exhorted to put up our Prayers to GOD, <IT>First</IT>, For those who frequent such Places, that they may see their Error, repent of their Sin and Folly, and do so no more. If <PB
N="28">neither Sermons nor Advice can prevail; yet we know not but our Prayers may reach them, and GOD may have Mercy on them for our Sakes. <IT>Secondly</IT>, Let us pray to GOD for the whole Na&rehy;tion, that he would not lay these Sins to our Charge, but try and spare us a little longer. Never was there a greater Occasion for this than now. Do we think that there is a GOD? and that he is the Creator and Governor of the World and all that is therein? Can we <NOTE

<P>&Iic; Suppose that it will be urged, in Vindication of the Stage, that some of the Plays here mention'd are of an ancient Date, and are now out of Use.
</P><P>To this it may be answered, that if this is true, yet it cannot be ex&rehy;pected, that every Clergyman, who attacks the Profaneness and Lewdness of the <IT>Play-House</IT>, must have read the Stage quite through, or can be Judge, what are acted there, and what are not. The Reading of one or two, which are most frequented, will give a Man a Surfeit, who hath any Sense of <IT>Religion</IT>, and by these he may easily guess at the rest. However, this Objection is of no Force. <IT>First</IT>, Because they take the oldest Plays, which are fittest for their Purpose. Thus the Tragedy of <IT>Mackbeth</IT> continues in Esteem; and no visible Reason can be given for it, but because the Pleasures of Witchcraft are set forth to the greatest Advantage, and herein we have a full Account of the infallible Fore-knowledge of the Devil. <IT>Secondly</IT>, Those Plays, <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Love for Love, <IT>and</IT> Tunbridge-Walks, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></NOTE> which were justly exposed by <IT>Collier</IT>, at the first Attack upon the <IT>Stage</IT>, as most scandalous for Swearing, <PB
N="32">Cursing, Smut, Burlesquing the sacred <IT>Scriptures</IT>, and all other Sorts of Profaneness, continue still to be acted with the same Applause as formerly. To this may be added, that a Book was printed in the Year 1706, intituled, <Q
REND="it">The Evil and Danger of Stage-Plays, shewing their natural Tendency to de&rehy;stroy Religion, and introduce a general Corruption of Manners, in almost two thousand Instances, taken from the Plays of the two former Years, against all the Methods lately used for their Reformation</Q>; and since this another was printed in the Year 1719, intituled, <Q
REND="it">A Serious Remonstrance in Behalf of the <RO>Christian</RO> <IT>Religion, against the horrid Blasphe&rehy;mies and Impie&rehy;ties, which are still used in the</IT> Eng&rehy;lish Play-Houses, to the great Dishonour of Almigh&rehy;ty <RO>GOD</RO>, and in Contempt of the Statutes of this Realm, shewing their plain Tendency to overthrow all Piety, and advance the Interest and Honour of the Devil in the World; from almost seven thousand Instances, taken out of the Plays of the present Cen&rehy;tury, and especially of the five last Years, in Defi&rehy;ance of all Methods hitherto used for their Reforma&rehy;tion.</Q> Among others there are these <IT>Chapters</IT>, where&rehy;in the Contents are fully proved.</P>

<P><Q REND="it"><RO><SC>Chap.</SC> 20. </RO>The Holy Scriptures burlesqued by the Stage.</Q></P>
<P>Neither of these Books have yet been answered, neither hath there been any Method taken for their Reformation. They wholly act as their Interest guides them, without any Restraint; and we too plainly see, that their Interest guides them to pick out the worst Plays, which were ever acted in all Ages and Places. So that whatever hath been written upon this Subject, and any Quotation from any of their Plays, is of full Force at this <PB
N="34">Time, and may be alledged against their present Practice.</P>
<P><IT>Secondly</IT>, It is urged in their Vindication, That they are obliged to make profane Persons speak and act according to their Character. To this it may be answered, That this Liberty may be allow&rehy;ed in every thing, which is not sinful in it-self, but no further. But this hath been formerly and ef&rehy;fectually answered. <IT>Collier</IT> having exposed some Plays of <IT>Congreve</IT> for this Reason, he makes this Excuse in print, and urged it as far as it would go; to which <IT>Collier</IT> made a Reply, and shewed the Weakness and Insufficiency of this Pretence. So that they, who urge this Argument, ought first to answer that Book, or otherwise it stands as an Answer, to all that they still assert. But the still Insisting on this baffled Argument shews that such Men will never take an Answer, and with them there is no arguing. However, nothing of this can excuse the present Stage. All these horrid Blasphemies and the vilest Expressions are put into the Mouths of their principal Actors, whom they reward at last, and crown with Suc&rehy;cess. And this is the utmost, which can be done by them to promote it in the World.</P>
<P>In short, Profaneness, though never so well corrected, <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Collier's <IT>Short View of the Stage, Page</IT> 96.</NOTE> is not to be endured. It ought to be banished without Proviso or Limitation. No Pretence of Character or Punishment can excuse it, or any Stage-Discipline make it tolerable. It is grating to <IT>Christian</IT> Ears, dishonourable to the Majesty of GOD, and dangerous in the Ex&rehy;ample. And it tends to no Point, unless it is to wear off the Horror of the Practice, to weaken the Force of Conscience, and to teach the Lan<PB
N="35">guage of the Damned. When such Actors are made to prosper according to their Wishes, it is much more scandalous and provoking, and there is hardly any thing, which can exceed it, except the Pleading for it.</P>
<P><IT>Lastly</IT>, It may be urged in Vindication of the <IT>Tragedy</IT> of <IT>Mackbeth</IT>, that the Consulting with Witches is discouraged, because <IT>Mackbeth</IT> himself, the principal Person in the Play, came to an un&rehy;timely End by Consulting with them.</P>
<P>But to this it may be answered, <IT>First</IT>, That granting this to be true, yet there is no Dis&rehy;couragement of <IT>Witchcraft</IT> or <IT>Magick</IT>. The <IT>Witches</IT> act their Parts <NOTE

<P>But <IT>Secondly</IT>, It is not true, that Consulting with <IT>Witches</IT> is here discouraged: For <IT>Mackbeth</IT> is not the only Instance in this Case. <IT>Banquo</IT> had his Fortune told him, that he should be <NOTE

<P>And certainly, when the <IT>Poets</IT> make every Tit&rehy;tle thus fulfilled, they cannot do more to encour&rehy;age those <IT>diabolical Consultations</IT>. But if <IT>Mack&rehy;beth</IT> was destroyed for Consulting <IT>Witches</IT>, it will also be remember'd, that he gained a Kingdom by the same Method, and this is a sufficient Encouragement. If the Apprehensions of temporal Death will not freighten Men from capital Crimes in other Cases, then certainly it will not in such Cases as these. Besides, Men are willing to ob<PB
N="38">tain their ambitious Ends, and either look not on such distant Consequences, or think to prevent them by being fore-warned. If <IT>Mackbeth's</IT> Ex&rehy;ample signifies any thing, the Moral is this. A Man may gain a Kingdom by Consulting with <IT>Witches</IT>; but he is in Danger afterward of Coming to an untimely End. But lest this should be a Discouragement, the <IT>Poet</IT> takes Care to revive the Spirits of those, who might be afraid, and boldly tells the Audience, <NOTE
N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><IT>Page</IT> 31. <IT>Line</IT> 34.</NOTE> That<Q><LG
TYPE="couplet" REND="it"><L>Those who expect, and do not fear their Dooms,
</L><L>May hear a Message, tho' from Hell it comes.
</L></LG></Q></P>
<P>The Prophet <IT>Isaiah</IT> tells us, that <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xlii.9; <IT>and</IT> xliv.24. <IT>to the End</IT>.</NOTE> his <IT>former</IT> Prophecies <IT>are come to pass</IT>; he also <IT>declares new Things,</IT> and <IT>tells</IT> us <IT>of them before they spring forth</IT>; and <NOTE
N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xli.26; <IT>and</IT> xliii.8,9; <IT>and</IT> xliv.7, <IT>and</IT> xlv.20,21.</NOTE> he challengeth all the Heathen Idols to <Q
REND="it">shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know <RO>them to be</RO> gods</Q>. The <IT>Stage</IT> roundly an&rehy;swers to this Challenge, and ascribes it all to the <NOTE
N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Mackbeth, <IT>Page</IT> 10. <IT>Line</IT> 27.</NOTE> <IT>more than mortal</IT> of infallible Fore-knowledge of the <IT>Devil</IT>, and so make his Delusions, uttered by Witches, to vie with those sacred Oracles, former&rehy;ly revealed to the Prophets.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this <IT>Play</IT>, as being one most frequently acted. There are a vast Num&rehy;ber of others, which are more flagrant than this. However it is plain, that a single Sentence is of&rehy;ten catch'd at, and turn'd to excuse the <IT>Poet</IT>, when the whole Plot and Contrivance lies the con&rehy;trary Way. But, alas! the Antidote is too weak for the Poison, or rather in this Case is no <PB
N="39">Antidote at all. It serves only to lull the Consci&rehy;ence asleep, or gild the Pill, that the Poison may be swallowed without being suspected.</P>
<P>However, as from this Instance it is easy to guess at the rest; so this may lead us into the usual Methods of the <IT>Stage-Poets</IT>. They respresent the worst Vices in the best Dress, and sometimes make a feint Representation to the contrary, as suffici&rehy;ent to atone for all their Enormities. With this they endeavour to amuse the World, that Men may not think them so bad, as they really are. Thus they usually answer the Objections, which are brought against them; and when they drown the World with an overflowing Sea of Profane&rehy;ness, they would fain make us believe, that they are inoffensive.</P>

</P><P REND="it">Tower-Division.</P><P>"&Wic;Hereas it was publish'd in the <IT>Coffee-House Morning Post</IT>, of the 24th of <IT>Septem&rehy;ber</IT> last, that a Gentleman, well skilled in the Management of a Theater, is obtaining Letters Patents to erect one in <IT>Ayliffe-Street</IT> in <IT>Goodmans&rehy;Fields</IT>, by Way of Subscription, and that the Undertaking meets with a general Approbation. And also by an Advertisement published in the <IT>Daily Post</IT> of the 30th of the same Month, it appears that only seven or eight Persons have applied to the Justices against Erecting the said Theater, but that there has been no Meeting about it. These are therefore to certify, that <PB
N="40">the Erecting the said Theater is so far from meeting with a general Approbation, that great Numbers of Gentlemen and substantial Mer&rehy;chants and Tradesmen, residing in and near the said Street, have applied to His Majesty's Justi&rehy;ces of the Peace, acting for the Division of the <IT>Tower</IT>, at several Meetings appointed for that Purpose, and set forth to them the evil Conse&rehy;quences that will necessarily attend the Carrying on such a Design. The Justices present at those Meetings were so thoroughly convinced, that the Erecting the said Theater so near several publick Offices, and the <IT>Thames</IT>, where so much Busi&rehy;ness is negociated, and carried on for the Sup&rehy;port of Trade and Navigation, will draw away Tradesmens Servants and others from their law&rehy;ful Callings, and corrupt their Manners, and also occasion great Numbers of loose, idle, and disorderly Persons, as Street-Robbers, and com&rehy;mon Night-Walkers, so to infest the Streets, that it will be very dangerous for His Majesty's Sub&rehy;jects to pass the same, have already ordered Ca&rehy;veats to be enter'd in the proper Offices, to pre&rehy;vent the Gentlemen obtaining Letters Patents for Erecting the said Theater, and are resolved to the utmost of their Power, to shew their Disap&rehy;probation of the same, by doing every lawful Act they can, to prevent so great a Mischief.</P><P>Sign'd by Order, <IT>Sam.
