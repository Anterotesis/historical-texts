<P>&Sic;O plausible and favourable hath the Hypothesis of various <IT>Ferments</IT>, congenial to and perpe&rehy;tually resident in the various parts, principally in the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN> of Sanguineous and more per&rehy;fect Animals, seemed to many of the <IT>Virtuosi</IT> of this our inquisitive age; that they have not doubted to ascribe to them a powerful energy and necessary in&rehy;fluence in all the divers Motions, all the Mutations, all the Concoctions, all the Secretions, and other opera&rehy;tions instituted by Nature in such Animals, either for the conservation of them in their single beings, or for the propagation of their respective Species. Nor is it easie for us to name any particular function, any action, though really and manifestly Organical, which the Sectators of this Hypothesis will not pre&rehy;sently attribute to some peculiar Ferment lurking and operating in the part, by which that action is done, and conferring (forsooth) somewhat of efficacy to&rehy;ward the doing of it: as if the organical constitution of that part were insufficient to the function and uses for which it was designed, without the help and co&rehy;operation of a Specific Ferment; or as if the whole Animal Oeconomy depended upon no other Harmo&rehy;ny but that of numerose Fermantations. In a word, they make them only not Omnipotent. As <IT>Heracli<PB
N="2">tus</IT> the <IT>Ephesian</IT> dreamed [<FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">panta psych&omacr;n einai kai daimon&omacr;n pl&emacr;r&emacr;</FOREIGN>] that all places are full of Spirits and <IT>D&aelig;&rehy;mons</IT>, that presided over human actions: <NOTE
REND="it" TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Diogen. Laert. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in vita</FOREIGN> Hera&rehy;cliti.</NOTE> So these Gentlemen imagine all the parts of Animals to be full of I know not what Spiritual Ferments, that by occult influence regulate and diversifie their functions. And this Comment many have endeavoured to assert by their Writings, with as much confidence, as if the verity of it were evident, either from cogent rea&rehy;sons, or by Autopsy: when in truth they are no more able to prove by solid Arguments, or by sen&rehy;sible demonstration, the existence of many of their imaginary Fermentative liquors or Spirits in the dis&rehy;sected parts, to which they are pleas'd to consign them; than <IT>Heraclitus</IT> was able to exhibit to mens sight any one of his <IT>D&aelig;mons</IT>. I say, <IT>many</IT> of their imaginary Ferments; I do not say, <IT>any</IT>. Because the <IT>Acid Phlegm</IT> found in the Stomachs of various Ani&rehy;mals, may perhaps so far emulate the nature of a Ferment, as to deserve the same name. For being endowed with an incisive, penetrating, and dis&rehy;solving faculty; 'tis not improbable but it may con&rehy;duce to the dissolution and liquation of solid meats, and together with the drink, serve, as a fit <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Menstru&rehy;um</FOREIGN>, to extract the laudable and alimentary parts of them, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ad modum tinctur&aelig;</FOREIGN>. But this liquation of solid meats in the Stomach, seems to be effected by mo&rehy;tions placid, gentle, and imperceptible in the state of health; not by those violent commotions and ir&rehy;requiet agitations that always proceed from, and ac&rehy;company Ferments properly so call'd, during their working: as all men that enjoy good health, feed soberly, and keep a regular course of diet, may easily observe in themselves. And therefore this Acid Phlegm cannot properly, and in Philosophical strict<PB
N="3">ness, be referr'd to the family of Ferments. The same may with equal reason be said also of the <IT>Bile</IT> and <IT>Pancreatic</IT> juice commixt in the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Duodenum</FOREIGN>. They may perhaps conduce somewhat to the farther at&rehy;tenuation and exaltation of the Chyle; they may also promote both the separation of the Nutritive from the Excrementitious parts of the same Chyle, and the insinuation and permeation of the former through the coats or membranes of the Guts into the milky veins: all this they may do, and yet not by way of Fermentation, whereof there is neither ne&rehy;cessity, nor sense <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in statu sanitatis</FOREIGN>; and to argue from a preternatural state to a natural, is a Paralogism. Now if neither of these two so much celebrated Fer&rehy;ments, hath any more right to that denomination, than what is precariously derived from some remote and slender analogy or semblance imagined to be be&rehy;twixt their nature, qualities, and effects, and those observed in genuine and true Ferments; as certainly neither of them yet appears to have: What ought we to think of all the rest of invisible Ferments supposed to reside in places, where hitherto they have never been found? Why may we not, till they shall be by Anatomical and other convincing experiments shewn to us, believe that they have existence no where, but in the brains of fancyful men? For my part, I blush not, even in this venerable Assembly of most Learned men, where I have as many Judges as Auditors, openly to profess my self to be of this belief: because <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de non apparentibus, & de non existentibus eadem ratio est</FOREIGN>; and because I have heard an eminent Member of this first and more ancient Royal Society, a man renowned over all Europe for his Philosophical and Anatomical Writings, deliver this judgment of the multiplicity of Natural Ferments fancyed to be in the <PB
N="4">body of an Animal, that they were a new-found <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">asy&rehy;lum ignoranti&aelig;</FOREIGN>. I say, of <IT>Natural</IT> Ferments; lest what I have said should be detorted to the exclusion of <IT>Pr&aelig;ternatural</IT> Fermentations, which I do not de&rehy;ny to be incident sometimes to the bloud and other humours of the body, more signally in Fevers, and some other acute diseases: though perhaps not so often as vulgar Physicians imagine.
</P><P>What I have hitherto said, may perchance seem to some of my <IT>Auditors</IT> to be a digression; and they may be apt to think, that I have made my first step in a wrong path. I am therefore obliged, in my own defence, to advertise them, that having proposed to my self to enquire strictly into the natural necessity or Mechanical reasons of the Motions of the Bloud; and finding the aforesaid Comment of Ferments lying, like a block, in my way: I thought it concern'd me rather to remove than to leap over it, and leave it for others to stumble at. For, some there are, and those too, men whose names are deservedly celebrated for their profound knowledge both in Anatomy and the Mathematicks, who in their books have professedly taught, <IT>that even the bloud it self</IT>, the seat of life, <IT>also undergoes a certain natural Fermentation in the heart, lungs, and greater arteries, as necessary to its perfection and vitality</IT>. <NOTE
REND="it" TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Joan. Alphons. Borellus <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">de Motu Animal.</FOREIGN> part. 2. pag. 76. Willisius <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">de Ferment.</FOREIGN></NOTE> A doctrine, which to me (I profess) seems very improbable, and inconsistent with the wisdom of Nature.</P>
<P><IT>Improbable; First</IT>, Because of all the various li&rehy;quors found in the body of an Animal, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in statu Natu&rehy;r&aelig;</FOREIGN>, the bloud seems of it self least prone to Fermenta&rehy;tion; which is incident chiefly, if not solely, to new and musty liquors: whereas the greatest part by much of the bloud is old, and by repeated Circulations well <PB
N="5">def&aelig;cated in its proper Emunctories, and by insensi&rehy;ble transpiration; and by consequence needs no Fer&rehy;mentation. True it is indeed, that new Chyle is ever now and then brought into the rivulet of the bloud, out of the common cistern thereof, by the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ductus thoracicus</FOREIGN> and the <IT>Subclavian</IT> vein, for a recruit: but in a quantity so small (a few drops perhaps at once; for more will not be found to bear a just proportion, either to the capacity of the common <IT>Receptacle</IT> of the Chyle, which is but little, or to the narrowness of the Pipe leading from thence to the <IT>Subclavian</IT> vein) as cannot in reason be thought sufficient to perturb and excite a fermentation in the bloud, with which it is mixt. If a greater quantity of Chyle were mixt with the bloud at one time; certainly the bloud would soon lose its native purple, and put on the white livery of the Chyle, especially in the descending part of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vena cava</FOREIGN>, where the commixture is first made: which yet no Anatomist (for ought I know) hath ever observ'd. <IT>Secondly</IT>, When Ferments are com&rehy;mixt with liquors consisting of heterogeneous parti&rehy;cles, they are generally slow in exerting their power, and by degrees insinuate and diffuse their active parti&rehy;cles through the whole mass, before they can so far prevail, as to raise an universal commotion and tu&rehy;mult in them; as common experience testifies: but the newly commixt Chyle and bloud are in a moment, at most in the space of a few pulses of the heart, rapt out of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vena cava</FOREIGN>, first into the right Ear, and then into the right Ventricle of the heart; so that here is no <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">morula</FOREIGN>, no competent space of <IT>time</IT> given, to ex&rehy;cite an actual fermentation. <IT>Thirdly</IT>, Here is want&rehy;ing also convenient place. To all Fermentations is required fit room, wherein the liquors may have li&rehy;berty to undergo an impetuose commotion and agita<PB
N="6">tion of all their dissimilar and contrasting particles; nor will the Must of Wine it self ever ferment, if it be kept in close and strong casks, as appears from the making of <IT>Stum</IT>: but the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vena cava</FOREIGN>, the Heart, and Arteries are fill'd with bloud even to distention, till by their <IT>Systole</IT> they squirt it forth, and then in the next moment they are replenished. What room then is left for the bloud to ferment in? Seeing therefore that the bloud is by its own constitution unapt to fer&rehy;ment, as bearing a greater analogy to the nature of Milk, than to that of Wine, whatever the <IT>Willisians</IT> have said to the contrary; and seeing that neither the small supplies of Chyle which it daily receives, are sufficient to induce, nor the shortness of the time in which it passes through the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">pr&aelig;cordia</FOREIGN>, nor the want of convenient room, permit a fermentation: what reason have we to assent to their opinion, who teach, that a fermentation of the bloud is necessary to its perfection and vitality? especially if we farther con&rehy;sider, that the same opinion is also</P>
<P><IT>Inconsistent with the Wisdom of Nature</IT>. Whose custom always is, to institute the most direct and compendi&rehy;ous methods, for the attainment of her ends; nor ever to use many instruments, where one may suffice, to effect what she hath design'd: abhorring to multiply things, without inevitable necessity. To this her ad&rehy;mirable Wisdom then it is injurious, to imagine, that when she had ordained in the bloud a certain placid, regular, and benign motion, by which all the hete&rehy;rogeneous ingredients or constituent parts of it, should be so agitated among themselves, as by their mutual conflict to produce an alternate expansion and con&rehy;traction, from whence a vital heat results, and upon which original life continually depends: she should notwithstanding institute a second intestine motion, to <PB
N="7">be at the same time, in the same subject performed, <IT>viz.</IT> a Fermentation; which seems unnecessary at best, and which probably might not only hinder, and impugn, but also destroy the former. A Fermentation would indeed raise a tumultuous agitation of the same dissi&rehy;milar elements of the bloud: but such as would be violent, irregular, and of a far different manner from the Vital <IT>Mication</IT>. But not to insist now upon the manifest disparity of these Two Motions, which may more opportunely be collected from what I shall soon say of the genuine and true one; let it be supposed at present, that both may operate in the same manner, and produce the same effects in the bloud, as to the attenuation and comminution of the grosser, viscid, and unagile parts; and the facilitation of the expan&rehy;sive efforts of the Spiritual, volatile or elastic: yet still it will remain to be inquired, why Nature should in&rehy;stitute Two Motions, where either of the two might singly do her work as well, if not better. If there&rehy;fore any defendent of this opinion, which I have here, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="FRA">en passant</FOREIGN>, impugned, shall vouchsafe so far to illu&rehy;minate my gloomy understanding, as to solve this Problem: I shall acknowledge the favour, and re&rehy;cant my opposition of it. Mean while, I will sus&rehy;pend the farther consideration thereof, and now ad&rehy;dress my self to the more important part of my pre&rehy;sent province, the <IT>true and undoubted Motions of the Bloud, viz.</IT> the <IT>Mication</IT>, and the <IT>Circulation</IT>: by both which, though divers in their origines and kinds, yet mutually helping each other, and conducing the one to the accension as it were of original life, the other to the distribution of influent life, the bloud is perpe&rehy;tually moved in the vessels that contain it.</P>
<P>By the FORMER of these, the <IT>vital spirits</IT>, or if you please the <IT>elastick particles</IT> of the bloud, now <PB
N="8">passing through the Ventricles of the heart, from their own natural force or expansive energy, endeavour to expand or unbend themselves; while the grosser and viscid parts resist that endeavour to expansion, by com&rehy;pressing them. Hence instantly, and by natural ne&rehy;cessity, arises a certain <IT>Colluctation</IT> or mutual striving betwixt the expansive motion or endeavour of the Vi&rehy;tal Spirits, on one part, and the renitency of the grosser parts of the bloud, on the other. And from this <IT>Colluctation</IT>, an <IT>actual heat</IT> is quickly excited or kindled in the bloud: actual heat being nothing else but an expansive luctation of the particles of the body or subject in which it is, as I professedly labour'd to evince from various instances, and a strong chain of propositions, when I first had the honour to sit in this Chair. Moreover, because this expansive luctation is not violent, nor unequal, nor irregular, nor con&rehy;sequently noxious or hostile to the nature of the bloud; but on the contrary always (<FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in statu Natur&aelig;</FOREIGN>) moderate, equal, regular, amicable, and tending not only to the conservation of the bloud, but also to the exalta&rehy;tion of all its faculties and operations: and because it proceeds from an internal principle, from the energy of the vital spirit contain'd in and ruling the bloud, or (if this be more intelligible) from the Elasticity of the aereal particles commixt with the bloud: there&rehy;fore the brisk motion or heat thence resulting, is also <IT>vital</IT>. For in that very expansive motion of the bloud, doth the formal reason of <IT>life</IT> originally con&rehy;sist: which Theorem also I have formerly, in this place, endeavour'd to explicate and establish. This admirable motion, from the various notions or con&rehy;ceptions which Learned men have formed of it in their minds, hath acquir'd various <IT>names</IT>. By some it is call'd <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">motus sanguinis intestinus sive spontaneus</FOREIGN>, be<PB
N="9">cause it arises from an internal principle, the expan&rehy;sive endeavour of the spirituose, or elastic parts of the bloud, and to distinguish it from the circular mo&rehy;tion, which is impress'd by an external Movent, <IT>viz.</IT> the Heart. By others, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Motus fermentationis vitalis</FOREIGN>, from the similitude they fancyed between it and com&rehy;mon fermentations: but improperly, for the reasons by me just now alledged. By others again <NOTE

LANG="LAT">Oeconomiaelig; Ani&rehy;malis exercitat.</FOREIGN> <RO>6.</RO></NOTE>, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Micatio sanguinis</FOREIGN>, the panting, or reciprocal expansion and compression of the parts of the bloud. Of these denominations, the two last seem to me more fully and emphatically than the rest to signifie the nature and manner of the thing denominated; as equally comprehending the double motion in a single appellation. Wherefore I intend hereafter to use these promiscuously, when there shall occur to me any occasion of mentioning the same motion. Mean while, I proceed to</P>
<P>The LATER motion, the CIRCULATION of the Bloud; the most noble and most useful of all mo&rehy;dern inventions, first obscurely hinted (as some think) by <IT>Cesalpinus</IT>, but afterward with prodigious sagacity, most exact judgment, and happy diligence investiga&rehy;ted, and with such convincing evidence demonstrated by our immortal Dr. <IT>Harvey</IT>, that now the verity thereof is no longer doubted of in the world. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">In Exercitat. Peripatet.</FOREIGN></NOTE> I wish the same were as well understood, as it is generally acknowledged: and lest I be thought only to wish this excellent knowledge, and of so great importance to Physicians, I will now again do my best devoir to ex&rehy;plain so much of the mystery, as I my self have for&rehy;merly left not sufficiently explicated: omitting to re&rehy;cite what is vulgarly taught in the Schools and Books <PB
N="10">of Anatomists, and touching only those things, which have been either pretermitted, or not rightly ex&rehy;plicated by others, concerning the <IT>Causes, Mechanical modes</IT>, and <IT>circumstances</IT> of this <IT>life-conserving</IT> motion.</P>
<P>There intervenes (ye know) a double pause or re&rehy;spite, which by Anatomists is call'd <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">perisystole cordis</FOREIGN>, between the two contrary motions of the heart; one betwixt the <IT>diastole</IT> and the <IT>systole</IT>, another betwixt the <IT>systole</IT> and the <IT>diastole</IT>: and this of absolute necessi&rehy;ty, because it is impossible, that the same body should perform two contrary motions, without a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">morula</FOREIGN> or space of time, how short soever, be interposed betwixt them. Ye know also, that the force impelling the bloud, which is the Compression of the heart, doth not act continually, but interruptedly or <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">per vices</FOREIGN>, short and almost isochronic or equal quiets interposed: So that the bloud express'd by the heart, doth not flow thence in a continued course, as rivers and fountains do, that are without intermission carried on by the weight of their waters; but gush forth and stop alter&rehy;nately, though this vicissitude be exactly regular, and proceeds in a constant order. Now these things consi&rehy;dered, it may seem consentaneous to conclude, that the motion of the bloud cannot be <IT>continuus</IT>, since two pauses or quiets are interposed betwixt every two pul&rehy;sations or <IT>Systoles</IT> of the heart, during each of which the motion ceases: but on the contrary ought to be e&rehy;steem'd and call'd an <IT>interrupted</IT> and <IT>mixt</IT> motion. And yet notwithstanding the verisimilitude of this conclusi&rehy;on, I doubt not to lay down and expose to your exami&rehy;nation this</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it"><RO>First PROPOSITION,</RO> <LB>That the bloud is carried in a round through the body of an Animal, in a truly continued, and never interrupted mo&rehy;tion.</HEAD>

<PB N="11"><P>This perhaps may sound like a Paradox: but that shall not a-whit discourage me from asserting it, while I remember that remarkable sentence of <IT>Minutius Fe&rehy;lix</IT> (in <IT>Octavio</IT>) <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Inest & in incredibili verum, & in veri&rehy;simili mendacium.</Q>
</P><P>Though it be true and evident, that the heart doth not, in the time of its pauses, express any Bloud into the Arteries, yet it is not true, that the bloud contain'd in the Arteries, in the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, in the habit of the body, and in the Veins, doth at the same time stagnate, and stop its course: but on the contrary is always carried on in its journey, though with unequal velocity. <IT>First</IT>, the Verity of this appears in the <IT>Arteries</IT>. For the afflux of bloud from the heart being wholly inter&rehy;cepted, either by a Ligature applied to the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">aorta</FOREIGN> at its original, or by cutting out the heart it self, as is com&rehy;monly done in Frogs and Vipers; we see, that ne&rehy;vertheless the bloud wherewith the Arteries were fill'd, is by degrees squeez'd out, so that they are soon after left altogether empty. And doubtless this ex&rehy;inanition of the Arteries happens, because they by their own spontaneous motion constringe themselves, and contracting their Circular Fibres, express the bloud into the habit of the parts: and are at the same time compress'd also by the contraction and tension, or the peristaltick motion of all the Muscles of the Body. From the observation of this vulgar Ph&aelig;no&rehy;menon, <IT>viz.</IT> the emptiness of the Arteries in dead bo&rehy;dies; the <IT>Ancients</IT> perhaps took occasion to believe and teach, that not bloud, but only Vital Spirits are con&rehy;tein'd in the Arteries. <IT>Secondly</IT>, this appears also in the <IT>Veins</IT>. For, that the bloud doth continually flow on in them likewise, not only when it is urged forward by the Arterial Bloud pursuing it, but even in <PB
N="12">the time of the hearts pauses; is evinced from this, that then the bloud runs on through the trunk of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vena cava</FOREIGN> to replenish the right Ventricle of the heart. But why do I mis-spend time in alledging reasons to prove a truth that is manifest to sense in Phlebotomy? no sooner is a Vein open'd, than the Bloud flows forth with a swift stream, and while the wound is open, con&rehy;tinues to flow without pauses or interruption, which is a demonstration of the thing proposed, <IT>viz.</IT> of the continual motion of the Bloud in the Veins.</P>
<P>Being thus assured of the effect, let us proceed to investigate the <IT>Causes</IT>; which are not equally evident, nor can we hope certainly to solve this Problem, with&rehy;out enquiring the Mechanical reason of the continual motion of the Bloud through the Veins. This there&rehy;fore I will now attempt to do. That Nature hath in&rehy;stituted no immediate Communication betwixt the Capillary Arteries and the Capillary Veins, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">per ana&rehy;stom&ocirc;sin</FOREIGN>, is manifest to sense, and now acknowledged by all Learned Anatomists: and therefore it cannot stand with reason to imagin that the Bloud in its Cir&rehy;cular course is emitted immediately out of the Ar&rehy;teries into the Veins, these vessels being separate. And though we opine, that there is some secret commu&rehy;nication betwixt the extreme Orifices of the Arteries and those of the Capillary veins, by the intermediate Spongy substance of the flesh, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, and glandules, or by the Cribrose substance of the Bones, as by the Pores of a Pumice stone: yet we are still to seek, by what <IT>motive force</IT> the bloud may be carried on from those intermediate Porosities, and insinuated into the veins. <IT>First</IT>, because 'tis consentaneous, that the impulsive force, whereby the <IT>Systole</IT> of the heart squirts the Bloud into the Arteries, is by degrees weakned, and at length languid in those streights of the extreme <PB
N="13">vessels, and of the intermediate Porosities. <IT>Secondly</IT>, Because the Orifices of the Capillary veins cannot con&rehy;tinue always open and dilated; their consistence being not hard and bony, but membranose, soft and slippe&rehy;ry; so that they are apt to be closed by conniving, and consequently to hinder the ingress of the bloud newly arrived. <IT>Thirdly</IT>, Because here we can have no recourse to the <IT>compression</IT> of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, and the Muscles, whereby the bloud should be squeez'd into the Orifices of the Capillary veins; for we see, that the bloud is suckt up by the Capillary veins, not only when the Muscles are invigorated and upon the stretch, but also when they are quiet and relaxed, and do not exercise their compressive power; as is most evi&rehy;dent in sleep, when the <IT>Circulation</IT> proceeds without intermission. This is confirm'd from hence, that in the Brain, in the Medullary substance of the bones, where no compression can be admitted, the Capillary veins receive the bloud as freely as in the softer flesh it self. Seeing then that the <IT>effect</IT> cannot be denied, <IT>viz.</IT> that all the bloud effused out of the Arteries is after absorpt and carried off by the Veins, to be brought back again into the heart; and seeing also that this is not effected by way of <IT>Attraction</IT>, there being no such thing as attraction in Nature, as I have more than once elsewhere proved: we are compell'd to assert, that the Bloud is imbibed by the Capillary Veins for the same reason, and by the same Mechanick action, by which Syphons, Sponges, Filtres, Chords, and all Porose bodies are penetrated by water with which they are moistned: which power is no other than the <IT>gravity</IT> of the fluid it self, which is augmented by the <IT>impetus</IT> of its proper motion, and by the impulse com&rehy;municated to it from external force. So the motive force of <IT>Gravity</IT>, which the bloud can want no more <PB
N="14">than water can, when it finds the small chanels of the Capillary veins open (for they can never be so closely constringed by the flagging and connivency of their thin membranes, as to leave no entrance for a fluid; as appears in the Pores of Ropes how hard soever twisted) must of necessity overcome the weak resist&rehy;ence of the streights in all Filtres and Porose bodies: and consequently the bloud may be insinuated into the Capillary veins by a Mechanic action like that of Fil&rehy;tration. If this proposition be true, the greatest diffi&rehy;culty occurring in the whole mystery of the Circula&rehy;tion of the bloud, is now at length solved.</P>
<P>The bloud having in this manner passed the afore&rehy;said streights, and entred into the Canales of the small veins, by the same motive force, whereby it was insinuated (for such an ingress is not possible without motion) may be advanced a little farther in its way by its proper force, and by external force, and also by the impulse of the new bloud following behind; as we see water suckt up by a Filtre, to be carried on to the end of the list. Afterward, because many small veins meeting together, make one wider <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ductus</FOREIGN> or pipe; and because in this larger pipe the former impulsive force of necessity grows more and more languid and faint by degrees, and by consequence the motion of the bloud is retarded: therefore it stands in need of some auxiliary forces, to be carried on the rest of its journey. These are, <IT>First</IT>, the force by which the Circular Fi&rehy;bres of the Veins, that naturally have a peristaltic virtue, contract themselves always after they have been stretch'd, as all Nervose and other <IT>tensile</IT> bodies are observ'd to do: <IT>Secondly</IT>, The Compression of the Veins by the weight of the Circumambient air or Atmosphear, and the Elastic virtue of the air in&rehy;spired: <IT>Thirdly</IT>, The Tonic motion of the Muscles, <PB
N="15">when they act; together with the various motions of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, and of humours discurrent through the body; all which more or less compress the veins. Now, that the manner how this compression promotes the continual decurse of the bloud in the Veins, may be the more fully and clearly understood; I will take li&rehy;berty to lay down this</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it"><RO>Second PROPOSITION.</RO><LB>That by the artifice of the <RO>Valves</RO>, the Compressions of the Veins protrude the Bloud toward the heart with a moti&rehy;on doubly swifter; not indeed in a continual flux, but with little pauses interpos'd, and with unequal velocities</HEAD>
<P>We here behold in the <IT>Grural</IT> vein slit open from end to end, certain <IT>Valves</IT> placed at unequal distances in the inside of the Vein: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Figure</IT> I.</NOTE> which for demonstration sake are accurately represented in this <IT>Figure</IT> expos'd to sight. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Figure</IT> II.</NOTE> These <IT>Valves</IT> (ye see) are nothing but half pockets of a membranose substance, or little bladders affixt to the sides or walls of the Vein, and resembled by AONMP. and BONQR. They are found sometimes single, sometimes in pairs placed one op&rehy;posite to the other, and laterally touching each other; as at NO. the convex tops of which pair respect the Capillary beginnings of the Veins beyond HL; but the Orifices of their cavities PO, RO, open toward the heart, have respect to the parts IK. Now I am to demonstrate, that from this structure and situation of the Valves, it is necessary that the Bloud be pro&rehy;truded toward the heart. Imagine then, that the same portion of the Vein HMQL is replete with bloud; and because by the circular Fibres of the Vein itself, and by the ambient Muscles, and perhaps also by <PB
N="16">the gravity of the Atmosphear, one part of the Vein is constringed after another all along; it must be, that the lateral walls ST come nearer to each other to&rehy;ward V: and then the Vein so girded will lose its Cy&rehy;lindrical form, and be turn'd into two little funnels, HVL, MVQ; which are less capacious than the former Cylinder, and therefore the bloud which was contained in the spaces VHS, and VLT, will be expell'd out of the Orifice HL; but the remaining quantity of bloud contained in the spaces VSM, and VQT, will be squeez'd without the Orifice MQ, toward IK. It appears then, that from the above&rehy;mentioned compression of the sides or walls of the Vein, the bloud is express'd in equal quantity to the op&rehy;posite parts; and this would certainly happen, if the Valves were removed. But because to the walls of the Vein within, MP, QR, are fastned two Valves; it is necessary, that the bloud impuls'd by a compressi&rehy;on made in ST, be forced through the narrow chink NO; because the yielding fluid contain'd in the cavi&rehy;ties of the Valves, and urged by the advenient bloud, is constringed, and thrust out of them; and then in&rehy;stantly the sides of the Valves, that before touched each other, NO, receding one from another, leave an open way, by which the flux of bloud coming on from MSTQ, may be insinuated, and pass forward be&rehy;yond AB. Again, after the bloud hath passed the confines of the Valves PO, RO, there necessarily follows a restriction of the little chink NO. For, the bloud it self must, by reason of its heavy bulk, and fluidity, fill the little baggs of the Valves, and so their soft and pliable sides being dilated till they mutually touch, ought closely to shut the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">rimula</FOREIGN> NO.</P>
<P>Moreover, because the Vein is not constringed in all its parts at the same time, but part after part succes<PB
N="17">sively; therefore after the bloud is transferr'd beyond the Valves within the little funnel ABCD, there fol&rehy;lows a constriction of the walls AD, BC, in the same time, in which ST is not constringed. And because by reason of the close shutting of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">rimula</FOREIGN> NO, half the bloud, that was contain'd in the spaces EAG, FBG, cannot flow back toward AB, finding the obstacle AOB fill'd with bloud, and retain'd by the Valves; it is compell'd with a reflex motion, like that of a Ten&rehy;nis-ball rebounding from the wall, to flow toward DC: and since by the same compression, the Bloud that was contain'd in the spaces EDG, FCG, is protruded beyond DC: therefore a double quantity of bloud is in the same time, in which the compression is made, expelled through that same aperture DC: but when a double quantity of a fluid is in the same time emitted at the same Orifice, it must run out with a double Ve&rehy;locity. Thus is our Proposition verified. And as to <IT>single</IT> Valves; from what hath been said of the use of double, it may easily and genuinely be inferred, that they also help to promote the course of the bloud, though but half so much as the double. Wherefore Natures wisdom is admirable in placing single Valves both at less distance one above another, and for the most part where the Cavity of the Vein is a little narrower, or where a less Vein laterally exo&rehy;nerates it self into a greater: in both which cases the necessity of this demonstrated acceleration of the mo&rehy;tion of the Bloud, seems to be less. In the trunk of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vena cava</FOREIGN> no valves are found; as well because of its ample Cavity, as because of its contiguity to the trunk of the great Artery, by whose pulsations it can&rehy;not but be somewhat compress'd, and consequently the Bloud flowing through it, proportionately promo&rehy;ted. In the <IT>Jugular</IT> veins also none have yet been ob<PB
N="18">served; probably because in them the bloud descends swiftly enough, from its own weight and fluidity. In <IT>small</IT> veins they are not placed; unless in the <IT>Coronary</IT> veins of the heart, just at the place where they empty themselves into the right Ven&rehy;tricle of the heart: and of these too the use is, not to promote the course of bloud, of which there is no need in so small a circuit; but only to prevent the reflux of it out of that Ventricle, in the <IT>systole</IT> of the heart, as appears from their situation, and from their conformation. Nor are any found in the <IT>Arteries</IT>, in which the bloud, with migh&rehy;ty force impulst by the constriction of the heart, and of the Arteries, needs no additional machine to ac&rehy;celerate its motion: except those that are placed in the inlet and outlet of the left Ventricle, to obviate the re&rehy;gurgitation of the bloud into the <FOREIGN

<P>To come then to a conclusion, and draw all the lines of this scrutiny to a point; since it is evident, that nei&rehy;ther Father <IT>Paul</IT> himself, nor his disciple <IT>Aquapendens</IT> had a right notion of the proper use of the Valves; <PB

<P>Having inquired into the velocity of the motion of the bloud in the Veins, and the mechanic causes there&rehy;of; let us next consider the velocity of the motion of the same bloud in the Arteries. For the clearer under&rehy;standing of which I lay down this Third Proposition,</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it"><RO>PROPOSITION III.</RO><LB> That the Arteries of an Animal, their constriction or pul&rehy;sation being complete, do not remain wholly empty of Bloud.</HEAD>
<P>Evident it is even to sense, that all the veins of a Sanguineous Animal taken together, are larger or more capacious, perhaps in a quadruple proportion, than all the Arteries put together: and the whole mass <PB
N="25">of bloud runs through all both Veins and Arteries, which mass in full-grown men commonly exceeds not 18, or 20 pints: and though the Veins, by reason of their transparent coats, always appear full of bloud, yet a man may doubt, whether the Arteries also be always full; that is, whether they only give passage to the bloud in the time of the pulsation, and then in the time of their quiet remain wholly empty, or not. To resolve this doubt therefore, I say, that the Arte&rehy;ries, if they were wholly empty in the intervals of their pulsations, then being laid naked to the sight, they would appear constringed and lank, like chords extended: but our eyes assure us, that on the contra&rehy;ry they retain their round and plump figure, and be&rehy;ing press'd by the finger resist the pressure; neither of which can possibly consist with a total exinanition. Again, the Veins being laid naked, if, after the pul&rehy;sation of the heart, the Arteries remain'd empty; then certainly would the pipes of the Veins by the quantity of 5 pints of bloud crouded into them more than what they are proportion'd to contain, be distended at least a third part more than they ought: but this is sensibly false, for their coats are not distended beyond their usual rate. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ergo</FOREIGN>, the Arteries are at no time wholly empty.</P>
<P>Moreover, in Animals whose Arteries are transpa&rehy;rent, as in Snakes, Vipers, Eels, Froggs, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> we may from their Purple or bluish colour perceive the Arteries to be full of bloud. Which is alone sufficient to evince, that the Arteries do not remain empty after the pulsation of the heart, but contain at least a 4<IT>th</IT> part of the whole mass of bloud, which in a man is about 5 pints.</P>
<P>Yet farther, the Arteries, in the moment of their pul&rehy;sation, are highly turgid, when yet not above 3 ounces <PB
N="26">of bloud is emitted into them by the <IT>Systole</IT> of the heart. Therefore, if before the <IT>Systole</IT> the Arteries were wholly empty, a space 20 times greater than their bulk is, would inevitably be filled by the 3 ounces of bloud emitted by the heart: but this certainly is im&rehy;possible without such a rarefaction of the bloud, which no man of common sense will admit. Therefore to replenish so great a vacuity in the Arteries, there must come into them five pints of bloud, either from the heart, or back, out of the Veins: but neither of these is possible in nature.</P>
<P>Let us add, that 3 ounces of bloud emitted by the <IT>Systole</IT> of the heart, cannot fill a space greater than half a foot of the next Arteries to the heart. There&rehy;fore, if the Arteries were empty before the <IT>Systole</IT>; truly all the rest of the Arteries would remain empty also in the following <IT>Systole</IT>; and consequently could not beat at the same time with the heart, and the Cir&rehy;culation of the bloud through them would be inter&rehy;rupted or discontinued, contrary to the mechanic ne&rehy;cessity thereof.</P>
<P>In fine, we are convinced by common experience, when an Artery, whether it be great or small, is cut, the bloud is in every pulsation squirted out with mighty violence. Now it is impossible this should happen, unless all the Arteries were full of bloud all along from their beginning to their end; because the violence of the stream of bloud gushing from the in&rehy;cision, hath no other efficient cause, but the protru&rehy;sion of the bloud coming on behind and urging the antecedent. But in the following pulsation there is an accession of no more than 3 ounces of bloud; which cannot by its quantity replenish half the capa&rehy;city of the Arteries. Therefore unless there remain, after every pulsation, 5 pints of bloud in the Arteries, <PB
N="27">they cannot be made turgid again in the following pul&rehy;sation. So that nothing is more certain or more evi&rehy;dent than this, that in a living Animal the Arteries are never empty. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Quod erat ostendendum</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>From the pr&aelig;cedent Theorem naturally arises this <IT>Consectary</IT>:</P>
<P>That after the pulsation of the heart, there remains in the Arteries the 4<IT>th</IT> part of the whole mass of bloud conteined in the body of an Animal; and in a man commonly about 5 pints: and that the proportion of bloud expressed by the Systole of the heart into the Ar&rehy;teries, is about one twentieth part of the bloud con&rehy;tain'd in them. As also that 3 ounces of bloud ejected out of the heart into the Arteries, fill a space in the Arteries next to the heart no greater than half a foot, namely so much as is triple, or quadruple to the lati&rehy;tude of the Ventricles of the heart.</P>

<P>Because in the same time are absolved all these moti&rehy;ons, <IT>viz.</IT> the dilatation of the Pores of the heart, the restriction of its Cavities by the swelling inward of the walls of the Ventricles, the expulsion of the bloud contein'd in the Ventricles, the motion of the expulsed bloud in the Arteries, and the promotion of the mass of bloud pr&aelig;existent in them, caused by the urgency of the new bloud coming on out of the heart: all these actions, I say, are performed in the same time.</P>
<PB N="28"><P>And it appears, that the three former operations are performed with the same velocity in the heart, be&rehy;cause the Fibres of the heart, by reason of their abbre&rehy;viation, are with the same motion moved through the same space of the amplitude of the Ventricles, through which they are moved by restringing the same Ven&rehy;tricles, and squirting out the bloud that was conteined in them. And the two last operations likewise are per&rehy;formed with the same velocity. For look how much space the bloud expelled out of the heart runs through in the Arteries, just so much space must the mass of bloud pr&aelig;existent in them be driven through, in the same time; because one part of the bloud must give way to another urging it forward, as fast as that comes on behind.
</P><P>But if the motion of the constriction of the heart be compared with the progressive motion of the bloud in the Arteries; then doubtless they will not be found to be of equal velocity: because the former motion, <IT>viz.</IT> of the constriction of the heart, is made through a space equal to the latitude of the Ventricles of the heart, which at most excedes not 3 inches breadth: but the space through which the 3 ounces of bloud expressed out of the heart, run in the Arteries, is equal to the length of half a foot. Therefore the space will be triple at least to the space of the former motion: and yet both these motions are performed in the same time. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ergo</FOREIGN>, the motion of the bloud in the Arteries is threefold swifter than the motion of the heart, that causes it. <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Quod erat propositum</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>I add this remark, that the motion of the bloud in the Arteries is always the same, whether the three ounces of bloud emitted into them out of the heart, exactly fill the space dilated in them; or whether any portion of it be after their repletion expell'd out of <PB
N="29">them. For in both cases, the bloud pr&aelig;existent in the Arteries, is just so much promoved in its course, as 3 ounces newly emitted take up of space, which run through more of length than half a foot. &para; &because;</P>
</DIV><DIV><P>Here I cannot fairly decline to encounter a vulgar error, that stands in my way. Which is, That the bloud is expelled out of the Orifices of the Arteries into the substance of the Parts, by no other cause but the constriction of the Heart. To refute which I will assert this</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD REND="it"><RO>PROPOSITION</RO>,<LB>That the cause expelling the Bloud out of the Arteries, is not the Systole of the Heart alone, but the constrictive or peristaltic motion of the Arteries themselves natural&rehy;ly and necessarily succeeding their expansion.</HEAD>
<P>To the pulsation of the heart two effects are subse&rehy;quent, <IT>viz.</IT> the repletion of the Arteries by the bloud emitted into them, and the expulsion of the same bloud out of them into the habit of the parts. Now certainly these two operations cannot be performed together or at the same time; because the former is done by dilatation, and the other by constriction of the same Arteries, which two contrary motions cannot be co&rehy;incident. Wherefore it is of absolute necessity, that the repletion of the Arteries be precedent, and the evacu&rehy;ation be subsequent.</P>
<P>But the repletion cannot be made without a violent distention of the transverse or circular Fibres of the Arteries, and we all know, that all the Fibres of ves&rehy;sels, no less than those of the Muscles, of the Guts, Stomach, Tendons, Membranes, and the like Fibrose <PB
N="30">parts, naturally resist distraction, and have a power of contracting themselves after extension. Yea more, we see that all Fibres even in their natural posture are somewhat upon the stretch: for when they are cut, they instantly shorten themselves toward both ends: which would not happen, if they had been constituted in a middle state betwixt laxity and extension, as a Bow unbent is quiet, suffering neither contraction nor distraction of its parts.</P>
<P>Now if all Fibres even in their natural state suffer some degree of stretching; certainly when the Arte&rehy;ries are replenisht with bloud, their cavity must be dilated; and in the dilatation of their cavity, their transverse or circular Fibres must suffer much more stretching, than they did before. And because to this dilatation of the Arteries a constriction immediately succeeds, which is not possible to be effected without an abbreviation of the circular Fibres of the Arteries; and because that abbreviation or contraction is conna&rehy;tural to the Fibres themselves: therefore it is impossi&rehy;ble, that the Arteries, after that violent stretching caused by their repletion and turgency, should not ex&rehy;ercise, by natural necessity, that mechanic power they have of contracting them&rehy;selves, by vertue of their circular Fibres girding them inward: and equally impossible, that the Arteries should so contract themselves, without expelling at the same time out of their Orifices, the bloud that dilated them. Whence it ap&rehy;pears beyond dispute, that the spontaneous constricti&rehy;on of the distended Arteries is the cause of the expulsion of the bloud out of them into the substance of the parts; contrary to their opinion, who ascribe this expul&rehy;sion only to the <IT>Systole</IT> of the heart. &para; &because;</P>
</DIV><PB N="31"><DIV><P>The natural method of acquiring Science, ye know, is to begin from things more known, and then to ad&rehy;vance to things less known; to procede from effects to their causes. Seeing therefore that we are now certain that the bloud in Aminals is carried by a per&rehy;petual circular motion through all parts of the body; our next business is to enquire, what are the <IT>Causes</IT> of this admirable motion, as well the <IT>final</IT> as the <IT>effici&rehy;ent</IT>.
</P><P>I begin from the <IT>final</IT>; it being a question worthy our consideration, why or to what <IT>end</IT> Nature, all whose counsels and actions are ordained by an infi&rehy;nite wisdom, <IT>hath instituted this rapid Circulation of the bloud</IT>.</P>
<P>Constant it is even from common experience, that whenever the bloud is quiet or ceases from motion, whether within or without the body of an Animal, the red and grumose part of it soon curdles, and is separated from the serose or <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">albumen</FOREIGN>: and so the con&rehy;stitution or contexture of it is dissolved and corrupted: whereas on the contrary, while the bloud continues in perpetual motion within its vessels in the body of a living Animal, so long the ordinate mixture of its elements, due temper, and vital constitution of it is conserved; for mechanical reasons in our ensuing dis&rehy;course to be explained.</P>
<P>It seems then, that such a mixture of the constituent parts of the bloud, upon which the vitality of it doth necessarily depend, cannot be otherwise conserved, than by a continual agitation and concussion made in the vessels, first by the heart, with strong force im&rehy;pelling the bloud through the Arteries; then, that im&rehy;pulsive force languishing by filtration in the spaces intermediate betwixt the Arteries and Veins; next <PB
N="32">in the Veins, by the constriction of their circular Fibres, by the compression of the Muscles, and the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, and the inspired air. All which compressions would not suffice, were not <IT>Valves</IT> placed commodi&rehy;ously within the Veins, by which the motion of the bloud is accelerated, and a farther conquassation of it made.</P>
<P>And here we meet with a fair occasion to reflect upon the mutual <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Anastom&ocirc;ses</FOREIGN> of the Capillary Veins, and the infrequent distribution of <IT>Valves</IT> in one and the same Vein: for both these contribute also their proportions toward the end now under our disquisiti&rehy;on. For, the texture of the Veins being indeed lax and soft, yet such as may by virtue of their circular Fibres be constringed and contracted: hence it is, that by the bloud regurgitating in those tracts of the Veins, that have no Valves, by the great quantity and force of its regurgitation or recoiling, the lowest part of the Vein is much dilated; and on the contrary the highest part is contracted: So that the bloud being by this reflux, though inobservable, agitated and conquassated, may revive its due commistion, and conserve its vital con&rehy;stitution. It appears then, the <IT>defect</IT> of <IT>Valves</IT> also hath its use. Within the cavities of the <IT>Arteries</IT> (as I said before) no Valves are placed, because the grand force, by which the bloud is impell'd through them, is more than sufficient to conquassate and commix it, by wedging in as it were the more fluid albugineous particles among the red grumose particles, that from both sorts comixt <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">per minimas moleculas</FOREIGN> (as they say) and yet mutually reluctant, the <IT>Vital Mication</IT>, or <IT>Oscillatory</IT> intestine motion of the bloud may be con&rehy;tinued. So then here is neither need of, nor place for a <IT>Fermentation</IT>. Now from the consideration of these things premised, I conclude, that the <IT>Circulation of <PB
N="33">the Bloud was instituted for the conservation of its requi&rehy;site temper and vital constitution</IT>: Which was to be inquired, and which leads us to</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>The admirable <IT>effects</IT> and <IT>benefits</IT> arising to the Animal Oeconomy from the same Velocity of the Circulation of the Bloud;</HEAD>
<P>Which being certainly so great, that the whole mass of bloud runs its circular race in the twentieth part of an hour, or thereabouts, even in a sedentary and se&rehy;date man; as hath by many been demonstrated from the quantity of bloud commonly contein'd in the body, from the number of Pulses made in an hour, and from the quantity of bloud exprest by every pulse of the heart: and we having already seen what advan&rehy;tage redounds to the bloud it self from this velocity: our curiosity spurs us on to enquire also, what other scopes or ends Nature may probably be conceived to have proposed to herself, when she instituted this so rapid motion; or what emoluments and benefits from thence redound to the Oeconomy of the whole body.</P>
<P>Of these the <IT>first</IT> seems to be this, that in every pul&rehy;sation of the heart, a great quantity of bloud is effused and protruded out of the Capillary Arteries into the habit of the parts, for their refocillation by <IT>influent life</IT> (of which I have formerly discoursed copiosely in this place.) For, by how much swifter the motion of any liquor or other fluid through a pipe or canale is, so much a greater quantity of it is, in equal time, ef&rehy;fused at the Orifice thereof; as hath been ingeniously demonstrated by <IT>B. Castellus</IT>: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Lib. de aqua fluxu.</FOREIGN></NOTE> and therefore the bloud is, like a full and rapid torrent, impelled into the Pores of the flesh and <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>.</P>
<PB N="34"><P>The <IT>second</IT> is the energy of the stroke, with which the bloud projected by the heart, dashes against the same extreme parts: which energy is composed of the degree of velocity, and of the quantity of bloud im&rehy;pulsed, as that excellent Mathematician <IT>Jo. Alphonsus Borellus</IT> hath fully demonstrated. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Tract. de vi percussion. Cord. prop. 28.</FOREIGN></NOTE> By this stroke it is, that the newly emptied and conniving porosities of the Muscles and <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN> are forced open and replenished with the impulsed bloud, that communicates to them vital heat and fresh vigor: and that the torpid, use&rehy;less, and excrementitious particles there remaining, are protruded and expelled, partly through the pores of the skin, partly through vessels destined to their transportation and expulsion. So that by this rapid rushing in of the bloud, nature attains to not only a reviving of the solid parts of the body, but also to the expurgation of the bloud it self from its unprofitable and excrementitious parts, in the Emunctories or&rehy;dained for that office.
</P><P>A <IT>third</IT> advantage is, that by the same rapid ve&rehy;locity of the bloud, and its vehement intrusion into the narrow <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">meatus</FOREIGN> of the parts; the current thereof dislodges, rinses away, and carries with it many other amoveable particles of various kinds, Saline, Sulphu&rehy;reous, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> principally the reliques of the nutritive and nervose juices brought thither from the brain; which though unprofitable now to the refection and invigoration of the parts in which they were left, may yet be of some use to recruit and conserve the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Crasis</FOREIGN> of the bloud, and to expedite the secretion of its excre&rehy;ments. This artifice of nature we may more easily comprehend, by observing, that the foreign particles now mentioned are extricated and rinsed away by the bloud, not in ample vessels, but after the egress of the bloud out of the Capillary Arteries, in the intermediate <PB
N="35">spaces betwixt them and the Capillary Veins, where end innumerable small Canales, some of which bring in the nutritive and nervose liquors, others export the superfluous and less profitable particles of them; which small pipes are, like the Capillary roots of plants, almost every where disseminated into the fleshy parts, into the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN>, and (most frequently) into the glandules. And this seems to be done, to the end that so many particles of these spiritual and noble juices, being rinsed away by and commixt with the bloud, may advance and conserve the due con&rehy;sistence and constitution of it.</P>
<P>Now of these three considerable benefits, no one seems to me possible to be attained otherwise than by the perpetual and rapid motion of the bloud. Where&rehy;fore I am not destitute of a rational ground to support my conjecture, that for these ends Nature thought fit to institute the swift motion of the bloud in its Circulation. &para; &because;</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>But what may we conceive to be the reason that induced Her to institute also so multiplied a <IT>repe&rehy;tition</IT> of this course of the bloud through the same ways?</HEAD>
<P>A River, we know, though the water be in a con&rehy;tinual flux, is yet still the same river, because the elapsed parts are continually succeeded by new waters coming on with the same degree of speed to supply it. But to maintain this perpetual succession and supply, upon which the identity of the river necessarily de&rehy;pends, there is required, either an immense quantity of waters from a spring to feed the current, or the same elapsed water must be brought back again to the foun&rehy;tain whence it flowed, that so by perpetually reiterated <PB
N="36">circuitions the course of the river may be conserved, which otherwise would soon fail and cease.</P>
<P>We are then no longer to admire that Nature, having designed to bring the river of bloud with a most rapid course through the whole body of an Animal, for the various ends above explained; and resolved to make that course perpetual, during the life of the Animal: made use of the same expedient, <IT>viz.</IT> to <IT>repete</IT> the circuition of the same bloud without intermission. For the whole mass of bloud commonly found in the body of a man, not exceding 20 pints; and that quantity not suf&rehy;ficing to maintain the course above 5 or 6 first minutes of an hour: lest the current might cease, and so life also fail, it was necessary that the circulation of the same mass of bloud should be continually reiterated, for the conservation of life.</P>
<P>Besides this necessity, there are many admirable uses and advantages which Nature brings to an Animal, by often repeating the period of the circuition of the bloud through the same ways. For if the Circulation were not in this manner reiterated, the bloud could not be def&aelig;cated from it biliose excrement in the Liver, nor (according to the vulgar opinion) from the matter of Urine in the Kidneys; nor could either the Chyle be commixt with the bloud in the heart, or the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Lympha</FOREIGN> be brought to temper and dilute it in the Veins: nor could various other operations necessary to the Animal &oelig;co&rehy;nomy be performed. All which it were not difficult for me to deduce from this repeted circuition of the Bloud, if the shortness of the time appointed to me for the administration of my present province, did not ob&rehy;lige me to pass by all collateral disquisitions, and to per&rehy;use my principal Theme, the Motion of the Bloud. From the <IT>final</IT> causes of which I will therefore in a di&rehy;rect order procede to the <IT>Efficient</IT>. &para; &because;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY>
