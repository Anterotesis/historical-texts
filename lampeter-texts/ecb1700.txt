<P>&Tic;HE Highlands of <RO>Scotland, Wales, Biscay, Switzerland</RO>, and other Countries (not worth the conquering) continue still in possession of their Aborigines: Whereas, <RO>England</RO> being a Coun&rehy;try (as was said of the Tree of Paradice) good for Food, pleasant to the Eyes, and to be desired, hath been possessed by Five several Nations, and coveted by many more.
</P><P>Yet view its Coasts they'l appear Bold, and but thinly Inhabited, and the Civil Wars of our Island having occasioned the demolishing of its strong Holds, in case of Attack how can we be defended against Foreign powerful Enemies, but by a Naval Pow&rehy;er.</P>
<P>Allowing us Masters of more Tall Ships than any of our Neighbours. What Security can a nu&rehy;merous Navy afford, if Marriners be wanting.</P>
<P>Whether <RO>England</RO> wants Marriners best appears by our turning 'em o're from Ship to Ship, by our long, long Embargoes, and yet excessive Charge in Pressing, and by so many of our Ships being lost (during the late War) for want of their Com&rehy;plement.</P>
<PB N="[iv]"><P>Nor can the Number of our Seamen be readily Encreast, without Establishing a <RO>Fishery</RO>. For Men of War and Merchantmen spend many Marriners and breed Few, the great and best Nursery for Sea&rehy;men is the <RO>Fishery</RO>; where each Dogger brings up (it may be) Six, Eight, or Ten, new Men every Year, and the Fishermens Business lying where our Ship's Danger lies, makes them know how the Sands shift, where the Rocks and Shelves are; consequent&rehy;ly most able Coasters and admirable Pilots.
</P><P>Besides by frequent riding out great Storms in small Busses and Doggers, Fishermen become so steel&rehy;ed and habituated to Danger, that in Tempests and Engagements they work Wonders; and the Fish lying upon our own Coasts, the Men we employ to catch them (though out of his Majesties Pay) will be ever at Hand, and so ready for Service, as to make our watchfullest Enemies despair of surprizing us.</P>
<P><RO>Again</RO> <Q>"A due Care for our Poor, is an Act of great Civil Prudence and Political Wisdom, for Poverty in it self is apt to E&rehy;masculate the Minds of Men, or at least it makes Men tumultuous and unquiet, where there are very many Poor; the Rich cannot long or safely continue such; necessity renders Men of Phlegmatick and dull Natures, Stupid and Indisciplinable, and Men of more fiery or active Constitutions, Rapacious and Desperate.</Q> <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="inline" ANCHORED="NO">L.C.J.Hale <RO>in his Discourse touching Pro&rehy;vision for the Poor</RO>.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Poors Rates of <RO>England</RO> (besides Voluntary Charity) amounts to near a Million <RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Annum</FOREIGN></RO>; <PB N="[v]">by which its Evident, what vast Numbers of Beg&rehy;gers and Idle Persons live upon the Publick without return of Labour for their Bread; now Beggars Children (if not destroy'd in the Womb, or at the Birth) being bred up in Want and Laziness: Be&rehy;come of unhealthful Bodies, and more than ordinary subject to many loathsome Diseases, whereof abundance die in their tender Age; and such as attain to riper Years, by idle Habits contracted in their Youths, are rendred for ever unapt and undisposed for La&rehy;bour, and serve only to stock the Kingdom with Theives and Beggars: So that without a due Care for Relief of our Poor in a way of Industry, they'l daily Encrease.</P>
<P>Suppose, to employ our Poor any one Manufacture be encouraged: It may perchance remove the present Trade of one City or Country to another, and occa&rehy;sion such Complaints as the <RO>Button-Makers</RO> (not long since) made against Cloath Buttons, yet leave the generality of our Poor destitute of a convenient Support and Provision.</P>
<P>Nay, could we at once Encourage every Ma&rehy;nufacture in <RO>England</RO>, encreasing our Manufactures and not our Food, would only lessen the Misery of our present Poor by sharing it amongst all the People of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The most effectual Expedient then to employ our Poor, is to Establish a <RO>Fishery</RO>; which by affording them at once both Food and Employment, would quickly turn the great Burthen of our Nation into an equal Benefit.</P>
<PB N="[vi]"><P>Much more might be said to this Purpose; but at present shall only add that within thirty Years past, our active Neighbours the <RO>French</RO> have encreased their Navigation to a Proverb. Given <RO>Europe</RO> much disquiet, and cost <RO>England</RO> (in particular) abundance of Blood and Treasure. But had not <RO>Englishmen</RO> been guilty of more than <RO>Spanish</RO> sloath in not putting forth their Hands to take that Rich blessing, (the <RO>Fishery</RO>) which Providence by placing upon our Coasts, courts us (as it were) to receive all our Sovereignes (as well as Queen <RO>Elizabeth</RO>,) might have bounded the Numbers of the <RO>French</RO> Fleet, and by the blessing of God have been <LB><FOREIGN

<SP><SPEAKER><RO>Dutch-Man,</RO></SPEAKER><P>GOOD morrow Friend, what art musing on?
</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>English-Man</IT>,</SPEAKER> <P>Considering the Extent of these your Dykes, I was thinking what excessive Charge and Pains <IT>Holland</IT> is yearly at to de&rehy;fend it self against invading Waves: Whereas the Sea that encircles happy <IT>England</IT> (Barrier like) fenceth it against Surprize and Ravages, exempts us from the Charge and Terrour of Garrisons and Fortifications, and (with our Floating Castles) continues to us that quiet Li&rehy;berty and Security the rest of <IT>Europe</IT> more or less have lost.</P></SP>
<PB N="2"><SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>What though <RO>England</RO> be fenc'd in by the Seas, happier <RO>Holland</RO> hath a mighty Ocean of Wealth to defend it, and Money you know is the Sinews of War.
</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>E.</IT></SPEAKER> <P>The cold Winds (being moistened by the Vapours, or softned by the warmth of the Seas motion before they reach our Islands) are less fierce, and the Air is far more Mild and Temperate (if not more Healthy) than any part of the Continent under the same Climate; so that we have no necessity for Grotto's in Summer, or Stoves in Winter.</P></SP>
 <SP><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER><P>In my Opinion, that Country is still Happiest that is stored with the Richest growths and products for Trafick and Commerce, and the Air ever best where most Money is stirring; for Poverty and Want will render People unhealthy in all Climates.

<P>The <IT>Dutch</IT> have above an hundred Leagues to Sail before they come to the <IT>Herring Fishe&rehy;ry</IT>, which is only in the <IT>Brittish</IT> Seas, and when there, must lie at the mercy of the Winds for want of a Port to Friend, and in case of Un&rehy;loading have as far back again, which takes up a great deal of Time, hinders Business, and endangers the loss of their Markets: Whereas, in <IT>England</IT> we have the Fish upon our own Coasts, so near our Shoars, that in case of Storms, Unloading, taking in of Provisions, or the like, it is but four or five Hours work (commonly not so much) to recover an Har&rehy;bour, and without loss of time put to Sea a&rehy;gain; the work of Unloading, Repacking, and sending our Fish to Market going on in all Weathers.</P></SP>

<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER><P> What other Advantages can you boast?
</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER REND="it">E. </SPEAKER><P><IT>England</IT>, hath many convenient Tide&rehy;haven-Ports, as at <IT>Hull, Harwich</IT>, and Holy Island to the <IT>Northward</IT>, and <IT>Dover, Rye, Portsmouth, Southampton, Cowes, Weymouth, Dartmouth, Catwater, Hamose, Fowey, Fal&rehy;mouth, Hilford, Scilly</IT>, and <IT>Milford Westward</IT>, where at low Water all of them are small Chingle or hard Sand; so that our Vessels may easily haul a shore, and Wash and Tallow at Pleasure; nor are Creecks and commodious Places wanting in <IT>England</IT> to lodge our Busses and Doggers safe when not employed, so as to prevent wear of Cables, charge of Watching, danger of Fire, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P></SP>
<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>What else?</P>
</SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>E.</IT></SPEAKER><P> The Shores of <IT>England</IT> are bold, its Coasts high-land, easily discovered, several of our Cape-Lands opposite to <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Holland</IT>, make <IT>Eddy-Bayes</IT> whose depth of Water is mean as six, eight, ten, or twelve Fathom the Tides (on our own Coasts) are small Anchor hold, generally stiff Clay, Chalk or hard Gravel, so that we need not dread Winter Storms, besides the Advantage we have of lying in a moderate Climate, and in the very Cen&rehy;ter of the Trade of <IT>Europe</IT>, affords us oppor&rehy;tunity of sending to Forreign Parts, from di&rehy;vers of our Ports at all Seasons of the Year: <PB
N="17">Whereas the Coasts of <IT>Holland</IT> are extreamly Low, subject to be Hazy and Foggy, have ma&rehy;ny Shoals and Sands, some of which lie so far off at Sea, that frequently Ships are Stranded before they see Land; its Ports are bad, and of&rehy;ten choaked up with Quick-sands; its Haven's yearly frozen up two or three Months together: And the <IT>North west</IT> Wind (usually blowing the greatest part of the Year) makes <IT>Holland</IT> a Lee, and <IT>England</IT> a Weather-shore, so that (oft times) whil'st you are Wind bound or Frozen up at home, we can supply the Mar&rehy;kets abroad.</P>
<P>Besides, wanting Wood at reasonable Rates, you cannot share with us in the Red-herring Trade.</P>
<P>As for Pilchards, they cannot be well cured unless brought Fresh on Shore, and being taken on our Coast's, will be Stale e're they can be carried to Your's.</P>
<P>Not to mention our Rich New <IT>England Fi&rehy;shery</IT>, our <IT>Western</IT> Ports are incomparably scitu&rehy;ated for the <IT>Newfound-Land Fishery</IT>, and the Country it self belonging to the Crown of <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, you can have no footing there.</P>
<P>Near the Pile of <IT>Foudray</IT> in <IT>Lancashire</IT>, and in several other Places along the Shores of <IT>Wales</IT>; we can Fish even without the Charge of Busses, for by only setting Nets on the Sands at low Water, great quantities of Herrings are taken next Tide of Ebb.</P></SP>
<PB N="18"><SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>Those Herrings on the Coast's of <RO>Lancashire</RO> (coming newly out of the Ocean) are so fat they will not take Salt kindly, consequently are apt to Reast.</P>

</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER>E.</SPEAKER> <P><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Dies Diem docet</FOREIGN>; those noble Salt Rocks in <IT>Cheshire</IT>, (sufficient to supply all <IT>Europe</IT>) have not been many Years discovered.</P><P>Besides, of a Stone abounding in <IT>Shropshire</IT>, much Pitch is now made of so Excellent a Na&rehy;ture, Heat only causeth it to penetrate deeper into Plank, and Cold cannot make it crackle off; both which are Advantages <IT>Holland</IT> can't pretend to.</P></SP>

<SP><SPEAKER REND="it"><RO>D.</RO> </SPEAKER><P>What more?</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>E.</IT></SPEAKER> <P>The Coast's of <IT>Wales</IT> abound with Ash; which as far excels other Wood for drying Herrings, as its Bark doth all others for tanning Nets: Nor do we in <IT>England</IT> (as you) want Willow-hoops from <IT>Hamburgh</IT>.</P></SP>
<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER><P> Notwithstanding all the Advantages you speak of your Chief Fishing Towns, <RO>Yarmouth</RO> and <RO>Laystoffe</RO>, are beholden either to us at <RO>Enck&rehy;huijsen</RO>, or to the <RO>French</RO> at <RO>Diep</RO>, for selling them Nets?

<PB N="20"><SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>Nevertheless, we have all Naval Stores in Bar&rehy;ter for Herrings, which costs us little but the trouble of hawling up out of the Sea, which being considered, and how much the catching such Herrings (by em&rehy;ploying and encreasing our Ships and Marriners, adds to the Wealth and Strength of our Country,) it con&rehy;duceth far more to our Advantage, then if <RO>Holland</RO> had Naval Stores of its own Product: Whereas, to purchase <RO>East</RO> Country Wares, the <RO>English</RO> are year&rehy;ly forced to Export much Coin, to the great exhau&rehy;sting of their Treasure.
</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>E.</IT></SPEAKER><P> We do not (as you) depend solely up&rehy;on the <IT>East</IT> Country for Naval Stores; no, in case of Exaction or Rupture, we can be suf&rehy;ficiently supplied from our <IT>American</IT> Plantati&rehy;ons.
</P><P>But if a <IT>Fishery</IT> be Established in <IT>England</IT>, what should hinder us from having Naval Stores in Exchange for Herrings as well as you?</P></SP>
<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>Your white Herrings are not so bright and good as ours.

<SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>We build Cheaper in <RO>Holland</RO> than you do in <RO>England</RO>, and Sail our Vessels with fewer Hands.
</P></SP><PB N="21"><SP><SPEAKER><IT>E.</IT></SPEAKER><P> Our Ships are much Stronger and Abler to brook the Seas than Your's, and will last twice as long; and as to your sailing with few&rehy;er Hands, we envy not your Happiness, whil'st (in proportion to your Tunnage and Number of Marriners) you yearly loose (by slight building and undermanning) far more Ships and Mens Lives than we, for which Reason, in above three Parts of the World, our Ships yield better Freight, where then lies the Odds? Which were there any, could be only in Mer&rehy;chantmen to carry our Fish to Market; Bus&rehy;ses and Fisher Boats carry more Men to catch Fish than are needful to Sail them: And in the <IT>Greenland</IT> Trade, each Ship must have Three times the Crew that can Navigate her, to Man their Shallops when a Fishing, were not this true since in building, <IT>English</IT> Shipwrights know no Masters, surely we might easily cause our Ships to be built and manned after your Mode.
</P><P>But supposing your Assertion true, if as all Ships that carry Corn to <IT>Venice</IT>, are permitted to Load Currants at <IT>Zant</IT>; so all Bottoms which Exported <IT>English</IT> caught Fish, might be allowed to return with a Loading of Naval Stores, without paying Alians Duty: That would set us upon even Ground with you, as to the Business of our <IT>Fishery</IT>.</P></SP>

</P><PB N="23"><P>In <IT>England</IT>, we have no Sumptuary Laws: So that Mercers not foreknowing Fashions, dare not lay out their Stocks till the Spring, at which time their sudden great Demands ren&rehy;der Journey Men scarce, and oblige Weavers to draw in Numbers of Apprentices, who in few Months supply the Trade of the Nation; when being turned off, many (like the Inha&rehy;bitants of the <IT>Bath, Epson, Tunbridge</IT>, &amp;c. who live by exacting on Strangers in Summer), are ready to Starve for want of Employment before the next Spring.
</P><P>Were a National <IT>Fishery</IT> established in <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, our Gentry by causing their Footmen and Servants to rise early and employ their idle Hours in making Nets, might not only reap the Profit of their Work, but by accustoming them to Business in their Youths, beget in them such industrious Dispositions, as would prevent (what now too frequently happens) their be&rehy;coming Beggars, or worse in Old Age.</P>
<P>The time of Labouring, and industrious Peo&rehy;ple well Employ'd, is the best commodity of any Country; and were a <IT>Fishery</IT> established in <IT>England</IT>, how Advantagious would it be to the Publick: When all our disbanded Soldiers, poor Prisoners, Widows and Orphans, all poor Tradesmen, Artificers and Labourers, their Wives, Children and Servants, each vacant In&rehy;terval may be getting a Penny by braiding and beeting of Nets, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>

</P><P>But the more we want Marriners, the grea&rehy;ter Reason we have to Establish a <IT>Fishery</IT>; which (as is shown in the <IT>Preface</IT>) is the best way to Encrease their Number.</P>

<P>'Tis certain, our Mariners do as cheerfully undergo Hardships, and are as bold in Danger as any, and for hard Labour, the working of a Mine is incomparably harder than that of a Buss.

<P>The cheaper Provisions are, the less Taxes will serve in time of War, House-keeping will be less Chargeable, and a less Rate maintain our Poor: But where Provisions are Dear, Work and Wages, will rise in proportion to the great Detriment of Husbandry, and stop to <PB

<P>Catching much Fish, will Morally speaking, render <IT>England</IT> less subject to a Famine, which generally exhausteth more of our Wealth in one Year, than War doth in two.</P>
<P>Catching much Fish, will give work to ma&rehy;ny Thousands of both Sexes that now are cloathed in Rags, and (through Poverty) live only on Bread, Water Pulse, Roots, and the like, who when they come to have the re&rehy;wards of their Labours in their Hands, will En&rehy;courage the Woollen Manufacture, by buying New Cloaths; and our Farmers by a greater Consumption of the Product of the Earth, By drinking Strong-beer, will advance the King's Excise by encreasing the Number of Tenants, raise our Rents, yet lessen our Poor's Rate and Taxes, by helping to pay them.</P>
<P>Catching much Fish, will occasion the ex&rehy;pence of much Butter, and make our Farmers run much upon Daries, the Business whereof though performed by Women, turns to as good Account, as the hardest Labour the Husband&rehy;man can employ his Time in: <SIC>Put</SIC> case the Market should be over stock't at Home, <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> Butter is too Good a Commodity in <IT>Flan<PB

<P>The Cheaper our Provisions are, the more Navigation will be Encouraged, more Foreign Ships will Victual with us; fewer of our's in <IT>Ireland</IT>, and the more Beef, Pork, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> shall we Export to <IT>Barbadoes, Jamaica</IT>, &amp;c. so that supposing Meat should not always remain at a very excessive Rate, yet where a greater Con&rehy;sumption causeth a quick Market, though at a midling Price; if the Proverb be true, light gains will make a heavy Purse.</P>
<P>It is cheap Provisions that Enables the <IT>Indi&rehy;ans</IT> to Supplant the <IT>Europeans</IT> in their Manufa&rehy;ctures; and should a <IT>Fishery</IT> make Provisions in <IT>England</IT> but one Tenth part Cheaper, Wages would fall in Proportion, and our Artists grow never the Poorer, yet our Merchants be ena&rehy;bled (by underselling) to beat all the rest of <IT>Europe</IT> out of the Woollen Trade, and then our Farmers would gain far more by the rise of the <IT>Fleece</IT>, than they'd loose by the fall of the <IT>Flesh</IT>.</P>
<P>After all, the Profit of Land in <IT>England</IT> doth not wholy consist in Breeding, abate in Gra&rehy;sing, and plow up more Pasture, and <IT>Flesh</IT> will hold its Price.</P>
</SP><SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>Corn is so Cheap in <RO>England</RO>, your Far&rehy;mers are often Broke by it, what then could you do with greater Quantities.
</P></SP><SP><P><IT>E.</IT></P> <P>The Reason why Farmers sometimes want Vent for their Grain, is because we have <PB
N="29">not always Store, and therefore Merchants makes no provision for the Trade. But if we yearly Sow such Quantities of Corn beyond the Expence of the Nation, as Merchants may be no less certain of a constant supply here than they are in the <IT>Sound</IT> (where the Country depends as much upon their Harvest, as <IT>France</IT> does on its Vintages,) Plenty would soon cre&rehy;ate a Trade, and the Advantage of <IT>England's</IT> ly&rehy;ing so much nearer than <IT>Dantzig</IT> to the Places where Foreign Corn is exported, together with the Allowance granted by the 25. <IT>Car.</IT> 2. upon the Exporting thereof, will sufficiently Encourage Merchants to deal therein.</P><P></P>
<P>Most of our Ships are now sent light to <IT>Bil&rehy;boa</IT>, and <IT>Lisbon</IT>, (now what loads our Ships helps our Navigation,) and our Exports to <IT>Lis&rehy;bon</IT> not answering our Imports from thence; the more we send them in Corn, the less their Wines will cost the Nation in ready Money, or Bills of Exchange which is all one.</P>
<P>Gold and Silver Mines <IT>England</IT> hath none, and in time of Peace no way to get Bullion, but by Foreign Traffick; to which, nothing can more conduce than cheap Fishing, and cheap Working and Manufacturing the Com&rehy;modities, which compose the Exports of our Kingdom, and that is, <IT>not</IT> to be effected except Labour be Cheap, which it can never be where Provisions are dear: But the cheaper our Provisions are, the cheaper our Exports may be afforded, consequently the more Vent <PB
N="30">we shall have for them, and much Vent will cause many Workmen, and when the Wheel is set agoing, Trade begets Trade, as Fire be&rehy;gets Fire; and the more Trade encreaseth, the more will Industrious People from all Parts flock to us, and Tenant our Houses, enclose our Wasts, improve our Lands, encrease our Ma&rehy;nufactures, and enlarge our Products, far be&rehy;yond the whole Expence of our Nation, and thereby in Proportion add to its Wealth and Treasure, for Merchants exporting the Surplus, will in Returns bring back Gold, Silver, and other valuable Commodities, which in <IT>England</IT> that hath property by Succession of Contracts, will diffuse among its Inhabitants, and thus as the Number of Persons made Rich by their Labour and Industry encrease, and the Choice of Tenants and Chapmen are enlarged, a kind of Competition amongst them, must and will make Rents and Lands advance in Pro&rehy;portion: Witness <IT>Holland</IT>, and such of our Lands as lie near Great and Populous Corpora&rehy;tions. So true it is, that <IT>Trade and Lands are Twins, that always wax and wain together</IT>.</P>
</SP><SP REND="it"><SPEAKER><RO>D.</RO></SPEAKER> <P>Notwithstanding what hath been said, I advise all your Country Men not to be concerned in a <RO>Fishery</RO>, for in <RO>Holland</RO> we have Money at Three, whereas the Trade of <RO>England</RO> is burthened with Six <RO>per Cent</RO> Interest, consequently you can never keep pace with us.

N="31">Turkey, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal</IT>, &amp;c. nay, to quit all Navigation, and abandon our Selves to the next Comers. Was it not the Fishing Trade gave rise to all your Wealth, and as Mo&rehy;ney grew plentiful in <IT>Holland</IT>, did not Lands rise gradually to near forty Years purchase, and Interest fall by degrees from Eight to Three <IT>per Cent</IT>? Why then may not we expect, that a <IT>Fishery</IT> will do the same for <IT>England</IT>, and be a means to regain our <IT>Muscovy, Green&rehy;land, Norway</IT>, and <IT>East</IT> Country Trades?
