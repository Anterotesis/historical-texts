<P>&Tic;HE House (according to Order) took into Considera&rehy;tion the Report from the Lords Committees, to whom the Report and Original Papers delivered by the House of Commons at several Conferences, were referred; and who were Impowered by this House to Examine <IT>Christopher Layer</IT> and such other Persons as they from time to time should think proper: And the said Report being read, It is resolved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled, That this House is fully satisfyed and convinced, That a Detestable and Wicked Conspiracy has been formed and carried on, for solliciting a Foreign Force to Invade these Kingdoms, for Raising a Rebellion, and inciting Insur&rehy;rections in <IT>London</IT>, and divers other Parts of <IT>Great Bri&rehy;tain</IT>, and even for laying Violent Hands on the Sacred Person of His Majesty, and on His Royal Highness the Prince of <IT>Wales</IT>, in Order to Destroy Our Religion and Happy Constitution, by placing a Popish Pretender on the Throne.
</P><P><IT>Ordered</IT>, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parlia&rehy;ment Assembled, That the Thanks of this House be given, by the Lord Chancellor, to the said Lords Committees, for their having Discharged the Trust in them Reposed, with great Exactness, Care, Fidelity, and Candor. There&rehy;upon,</P>
<PB N="2"><P>The Lord Chancellor addressing himself to the Lords of the said Committee, (<IT>viz.</IT> Duke of <IT>Montrose</IT>, Duke of <IT>Dorset</IT>, Earl of <IT>Lincoln</IT>, Earl of <IT>Scarborough</IT>, Earl of <IT>Islay</IT>, Lord Viscount <IT>Lonsdale</IT>, Lord Viscount <IT>Torrington</IT>, Lord Bishop of <IT>Sarum</IT>, Lord Bishop of <IT>Lincoln</IT>) gave them the Thanks of the House in the following Words:
</P><QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><SALUTE>My Lords who were of the Committee,</SALUTE>
<P REND="it">I Am commanded by the House to give your Lordships the Thanks of this House, for your having discharged the Trust reposed in you, with great Exactness, Care, Fide&rehy;lity, and Candour.
</P><P>My Lords,</P>
<P REND="it">The Trust was as great as ever was reposed by this House in any of its Members. The Subject Matter of your Inquiry, a Conspiracy the most Dangerous as well as Detestable, big with Mischiefs of all kinds, and destructive of every thing that is valuable amongst us; carried on and managed in a new devised Method, with the utmost Cunning as well as Wickedness, and covered with all the Disguises the most art&rehy;ful Dexterity could contrive: and which therefore required the greatest Penetration and Skill to lay open. And the Papers, some of them of such Nature, that it was thought fit to refer them to your Lordships, lock'd up as they were, without reading them in the House.
</P><P>My Lords,</P>
<P REND="it">Your Lordships have fully answer'd the Expectations the House entertained, when they pitched upon you for this Trust.
</P><P REND="it">Your Application in going thro' so many Papers of af&rehy;fected and studied Obscurity; your Candour and Exact&rehy;ness in Examining the Persons concern'd, or any way ca&rehy;pable of giving any Satisfaction, and in representing what <PB
N="3">they said; the Accuracy and Judgment of your Remarks; the Light you have so happily given to several Passages in the Report of the Committee of the Commons, which, tho' in themselves just, were yet liable to Cavils, by such as were loath to have the Truth found out, give, I dare say, a sensible Pleasure to every Lord here, that has heard your Report read, and finds himself thereby enabled to form a Judgment with so entire Satisfaction to himself, concerning this abominable Work of Darkness, which the Actors have endeavoured to surround with impenetrable Obscurity.
</P><P REND="it">This noble Pleasure, of seeing the Truth, notwithstand&rehy;ing so many Contrivances to hide it, and of being thereby enabled to come to right Resolutions in a Matter of such Importance, has very naturally and agreeably broke out into so unanimous a Resolution of returning the Thanks of this House to your Lordships, to whom they so much owe it. And in Obedience to their Commands, I do, with par&rehy;ticular Pleasure, give your Lordships the Thanks of this House, for your having discharged the Trust in your Lordships reposed, with great Exactness, Care, Fidelity, and Candour.

<HEAD>A <BO>REPORT</BO> FROM THE <IT>Lords Committees, to whom the Report and Original Papers delivered by the House of Commons at several Conferences, were referred; and who were impowered by the House of Lords to examine</IT> Christopher Layer, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></HEAD>
<P>[N. B. <IT>The Numbers with Letters before them refer to the Appendix to the Re&rehy;port of the Committee of the House of Commons, and those without Letters refer to the Appendix to this Report</IT>.]</P>
<P>&Tic;HE Committee to whom the Report and Original Papers relating to the Conspiracy, delivered by the House of Commons at several Conferences, were referred; and who were impowered by your Lordships to examine <IT>Christopher Layer</IT>, and such other Persons as they from time to time should think proper; having carefully compared the said Report with the Original Papers referred to them, and having examined several Persons in relation to the Treasonable Practices and Cor&rehy;respondences therein set forth, are fully satisfied and convinced, That a detestable and wicked Conspiracy has been formed and carried on for sol&rehy;liciting a Foreign Force to invade these Kingdoms, for raising a Rebellion and inciting Insurrections in <IT>London</IT>, and divers other Parts of <IT>Great Britain</IT>, and even for laying violent Hands on the Sacred Person of His Majesty, and on His Royal Highness the Prince of <IT>Wales</IT>, in order to destroy our Religion and Constitution, by placing a Popish Pretender on the Throne.
</P><P>And the Lords Committees think themselves obliged in Justice to ob&rehy;serve, that the extraordinary Vigilance and Application which has been shewn by the House of Commons in detecting this Scene of Iniquity, and laying its most hidden Springs in so full and clear a Light, as it has greatly contributed to the Publick Safety, by opening the Eyes, and awakening the just Resentment of an injur'd Nation; so it cannot fail to excite a propor&rehy;tionable Zeal and Emulation in your Lordships, for concurring with that House in the no less necessary Work of bringing the Authors of these wicked Designs to such exemplary Punishment as may be a lasting Ad&rehy;monition to Posterity, that Artifice and Disguise can no more lessen the Danger, than mitigate the Guilt of Treason, and that they act under a fatal Delusion, who hope to abuse the Lenity of our Laws to the Ruin of our Constitution.</P>
<P>The Lords Committees think it a strong Confirmation of the Truth and Exactness of the said Report, that several material Observations which are there advanced as grounded on probable Conjectures only, have since been amply verified and supported by fresh Discoveries arising from the Papers lately referr'd to them by your Lordships; which Papers are contain'd in an <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">Number'd from 1 to 48 Inclusive.</NOTE> Appendix annex'd to this Report.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>The Intelligence sent by Colonel <IT>Stanhope</IT>, and Sir <IT>Anthony Westcombe</IT>, in Relation to the Pretender's Ships under <IT>Morgan</IT>, as well as the Explication given by the Committee of the House of Commons to several of the ficti&rehy;tious Names in the intercepted Correspondence, is very much illustrated and confirmed by Papers seized on Board the <IT>Revolution</IT>, and by the Exami&rehy;nations of some of the Prisoners belonging to that Ship.
</P><P>It appears by <NOTE N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">17--48.</NOTE> those Papers and Examinations, that <IT>Morgan</IT>, who went by the Name of <IT>Walton</IT>, and <IT>Gallwey</IT> (an <IT>Irish</IT> Roman Catholick) who went by the Name of <IT>Gardiner</IT>, with others acting under their Direction, have for several Years past been employ'd in fitting out Ships under <IT>English</IT> Colours, which were ready on all Occasions to attend the Motions of the Pretender, who in <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">19,20,21,25.</NOTE> several of the Letters is stiled <IT>their King</IT>, and <IT>their Royal Master</IT>. That the Money for these Ships was supply'd <NOTE
N="&sect;" PLACE="margin">23,29,31.</NOTE> partly by Persons in <IT>England</IT>, <NOTE
N="&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="margin">17,21,22.</NOTE> partly by <IT>Waters</IT> the Banker at <IT>Paris</IT>, and <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">17.</NOTE> partly the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT>; that one of these Ships, in the Year 1719, <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">36.</NOTE> was sent by <IT>Morgan</IT> to the <IT>Groyne</IT>, with an Express to fetch the late Duke of <IT>Or&rehy;monde</IT> to <IT>England</IT>; at which time it appears, <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">23.</NOTE> that <IT>Morgan</IT> and <IT>Gallwey</IT> were promis'd a Supply of Fifty Thousand Pounds from Friends in <IT>En&rehy;gland</IT>; that others of these Ships lay hovering about the Coast of <IT>Britanny</IT>, from the Year 1718, to 1721, <NOTE
N="&sect;" PLACE="margin">22,24,27,31,32,34.</NOTE> expecting to be employed either by <IT>Cane</IT> and <IT>Chivers</IT> (General <IT>Dillon</IT>) or <NOTE
N="&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="margin">27,31,32.</NOTE> by <IT>Hore</IT>, (Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT>) in what they call their <IT>Home Trade</IT>. That in the Year 1721, despairing of any Em&rehy;ployment of this kind, on account, as is express'd in <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">32.</NOTE> one of their Letters, of <IT>Hore</IT> and his Partners being Cowards in <IT>Trade</IT>, they engaged themselves in the Service <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">17.</NOTE> of the <IT>Swedish Madagascar</IT> Company, and in <IT>December</IT> 1721 rendezvouz'd in the Bay of <IT>Cadiz</IT> for this Purpose; but this Project like&rehy;wise failing, on account of some Deficiency on the Part of the <IT>Swedes, Morgan</IT> waited on the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT> at <IT>Madrid</IT>, and was by him supplied with Twelve Thousand Pieces of Eight, for fitting out the Ships <IT>Lady Mary</IT> and <IT>Revolution</IT> <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">47,48.</NOTE> for the Pretender's Service; <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">17.</NOTE> soon after <IT>Morgan's</IT> Return to <IT>Cadiz</IT>, the Arms and Ammunition which had been prepared for the <IT>Madagascar</IT> Voyage, consisting of Two Thousand Muskets, Two Thousand Bayonets, One Thousand Carbines, Four Hundred Barrels of Powder, and a proportionable Quantity of Match, Flints, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> were consign&rehy;ed to <IT>Morgan</IT>, and by him put on Board the Pretender's Ship, called the <IT>Lady Mary</IT>; and <IT>Morgan</IT> having embarked on Board the said Ship with several <IT>Irish</IT> Officers, set Sail from the Bay of <IT>Cadiz</IT> the latter End of <IT>April</IT> 1722, and went first <NOTE
N="&sect;" PLACE="margin">47,48.</NOTE> to <IT>Sancto Antonio</IT>, and then to <IT>Sancto Andero</IT> in the Bay of <IT>Biscay</IT>. </P>
<P>The Committee having sent for Mr. <IT>Gustavus B&acirc;hr</IT>, formerly a Captain in the <IT>Swedish</IT> Service, who being at <IT>Cadiz</IT> on account of the <IT>Madagascar</IT> Expedition, had Occasion to transact several Affairs with <IT>Morgan</IT>, and the other Officers of the Pretender's Ships, they were informed by him that the Arms above-mentioned were brought, part of them from <CORR
SIC="Gottemburg"><IT>Gottenburg</IT></CORR>, and part from <IT>Hamburg</IT>, by one of the Pretender's Ships, named the <IT>Fortune</IT>, commanded by one <IT>Butler</IT>. That two thousand of the said Arms be&rehy;longed to the <IT>Swedish Madagascar</IT> Company, and were delivered by him, <IT>B&acirc;hr</IT>, to <IT>Morgan</IT>.</P>
<P>That the Remainder, which belonged to Count <IT>Rhenstierna</IT> a <IT>Sweed</IT>, were also purchased by <IT>Morgan</IT>, but not till some Weeks after the first two thou&rehy;sand. That <IT>Morgan</IT> went to <IT>Madrid</IT>, and returned with twelve thousand Pieces of Eight in Bills and Money, which Sum, he, <IT>B&acirc;hr</IT>, saw in <IT>Mor&rehy;gan's</IT> Hands. That Baron <IT>Seebach</IT>, and one <IT>Osthoff</IT> (who are frequently mentioned in <IT>Morgan's</IT> Letters) as also Count <IT>Rhenstierna's</IT> Agent, who de&rehy;livered the Arms to <IT>Morgan</IT>, declared to him, B&acirc;hr, since his Return to <IT>Gottenburg</IT>, That <IT>Morgan</IT> was supplied with these twelve thousand Pieces of Eight from the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT>, and that the Arms were paid for out of the said Money. And <IT>Morgan's</IT> Son being examined by the Committee, owned that his Father went at that time to <IT>Madrid</IT>, that the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT> was then there, and that his Father did there receive Bills for fitting out the Ships, but from whom he cannot tell.</P>
<PB N="7"><P><IT>B&acirc;hr</IT> farther declared, That all the <IT>Swedish</IT> Officers at <IT>Cadiz</IT> looked on <IT>Morgan's</IT> Ships as belonging to the Pretender, and spoke of them in all Conversations as such, which was confirmed to him expresly by Baron <IT>Seebach</IT> and <IT>Osthoff</IT>; and one of the Sailors of the said Ships owned to the Committee, That they went from Port to Port without taking in any Cargo; That they had sometimes but sixty, and sometimes one hundred and thirty Men on board the <IT>Revolution</IT>, and often received Orders for Sail&rehy;ing with all possible Expedition, which Orders were afterwards counter&rehy;manded, without any apparent Reason for one or the other, and that this unaccountable Proceeding satisfied him, the said Ships were engaged in some unwarrantable Design. <IT>B&acirc;hr</IT> farther declared, That <IT>Osthoff</IT> told him, the Ship <IT>Revolution</IT> was at first purchased in <IT>England</IT>, for transporting the late King of <IT>Sweden</IT> in Person, in his projected Descent on <IT>Scotland</IT>; and that he, <IT>B&acirc;hr</IT>, saw the Name <IT>Carolus</IT> still standing in the Cabin of the said Ship, when he was last on board her. And <IT>Morgan's</IT> Son owned, That he had observed the Arms of the Crown of <IT>Sweden</IT> in the said Cabin, which he supposed were placed there as a Token that the said Ship was engaged in the Service of the <IT>Swedish Madagascar</IT> Company, tho' he owned that the other Ships engaged in the same Service had no such Token.
</P><P>Some of the Particulars above-related, do very much explain and con&rehy;firm <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">AA 5.</NOTE> <IT>O&horfill;'s</IT> Letters to <IT>L&horfill;</IT> of the 27th of <IT>April</IT>, as also <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">AA. 4,6.</NOTE> those to <IT>Dunville</IT> and <IT>Dodsworth</IT>, in which it is said, That the Hopes of Remit&rehy;tances from Persons in <IT>England</IT> had induced <IT>O&horfill;</IT> to supply <IT>M&horfill;</IT> (which appears to be <IT>Morgan</IT>). That <IT>O&horfill;</IT> could depend on two thou&rehy;sand Arms from <IT>M&horfill;</IT> (which appear to be the two thousand Arms de&rehy;livered to <IT>Morgan</IT> by <IT>B&acirc;hr</IT> <NOTE
N="&sect;" PLACE="margin">17.</NOTE> before the Date of <IT>O&horfill;'s</IT> Letter. That <IT>M&horfill;</IT> had writ from <IT>C&horfill;</IT> (which appears to be <IT>Cadiz</IT>) that he could get more Arms if he had more Money; and accordingly the Committee find that a second Supply of Arms was purchased by <IT>Morgan</IT> from Count <IT>Rhen&rehy;stierna's</IT> Agent. <IT>O&horfill;</IT> in his <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">AA. 5.</NOTE> Letter to <IT>L&horfill;</IT> dated the 27th of <IT>April</IT>, says; <Q>'I have order'd <IT>M&horfill;'s Ship</IT> to come to <IT>A&horfill;</IT>,'</Q> and it <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">17.</NOTE> appears that <IT>Morgan</IT> did at that very time embark on board the <IT>Lady Mary</IT>, with the Arms above-mentioned, and <NOTE
N="&sect;" PLACE="margin">47,48.</NOTE> went first to <IT>Sancto Antonio</IT>, and soon after to <IT>Sancto Andero</IT>.</P>
<P>The Sailors on their Examination having mentioned one <IT>Hilton</IT>, as com&rehy;manding a Ship under <IT>Morgan</IT>, and the Committee finding a <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">27.</NOTE> Letter from <IT>Morgan</IT>, directed to <IT>Don Nicholas</IT>, which in a subsequent <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">28.</NOTE> Let&rehy;ter is mentioned to have been writ to the said <IT>Hilton</IT>, they thought it probable <IT>Hilton</IT> might be a fictitious Name for <IT>Nicholas Wogan</IT>, in the same manner as <IT>Walton</IT> was for <IT>Morgan</IT>, and <IT>Gardiner</IT> for <IT>Gallwey</IT>; having accordingly examined the Sailors as to this Particular, one of them said, he believed <IT>Hilton</IT> was a fictitious Name, and <IT>Morgan's</IT> Son owned that <IT>Hilton's</IT> true Name was <IT>Nicholas Wogan</IT>, and that he had been confined in <IT>England</IT> on account of the <IT>Preston</IT> Rebellion, as he was told by <IT>Nicholas Wogan</IT>, Jun. who went by the Name of <IT>Paterson</IT>: and one of the Sailors declared that the said <IT>Wogan</IT>, Sen. obtained the Command of one of the Ships under <IT>Morgan</IT>, after their Arrival in the Bay of <IT>Cadiz</IT>.</P>
<P>These Particulars agree with <IT>Glascock's</IT> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="margin">E. 31.</NOTE> Letter to <IT>George Kelly</IT> of the 24th of <IT>April, O. S.</IT> in which he mentions <IT>Nicholas Wogan</IT> by the Name of <IT>Xoland</IT>, as being to have the Command of a Vessel at <IT>Cadiz</IT>, to Cruise against the <IT>Turks</IT>, or <IT>for other Views</IT>, on which he will not pretend to de&rehy;cide; and <IT>Kelly</IT> <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">E. 35.</NOTE> answering this Letter, wishes <IT>Wogan's Chief</IT> may suc&rehy;ceed in his Journey. The same Particulars confirm Mr. <IT>Crawfurd's</IT> <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">A. 30,31.</NOTE> Let&rehy;ters of the 18th and 25th of <IT>July</IT>, by which it appears, that the two <IT>Ni&rehy;cholas Wogan's</IT> were at that time come to <IT>Morlaix</IT>, expecting <IT>Morgan's</IT> Ships to follow them to that Port in order to their setting Sail for <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>; that the eldest of them was to have been Captain, and the other Lieu&rehy;tenant of one of those Ships, and that they owned the Project in <IT>Spain</IT>, <PB
N="8">by what they had learnt of it, was for the late Duke of <IT>Ormond</IT> to have landed in the <IT>West</IT> with <IT>Irish</IT> Officers and Arms.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <IT>June, N. S.</IT> Colonel <IT>Stanhope</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">A. 15.</NOTE> writ Word that the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT> was preparing to Embark with Arms and Officers for <IT>England</IT>. And your Committee find, that <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">47,48.</NOTE> about that time the Ship <IT>Re&rehy;volution</IT> set Sail from the Bay of <IT>Cadiz</IT>; That the Sailors knowing the <IT>Madagascar</IT> Voyage to be dropped, refused to do their Duty till they were satisfyed as to the Place they were designed for. That hereupon <IT>Gallwey</IT> assured them it was to <IT>Gibraltar</IT>, in order to clean the Ship; but having got them under Sail, and satisfyed them about their Wages, they proceeded to the Bay of <IT>Biscay</IT>; That they put in at <IT>Sancto Antonio</IT> to take <IT>Morgan</IT> on Board, and then joyned the <IT>Lady Mary</IT> at <IT>Sancto Andero</IT>. That upon their Arrival at this Place, the common Report on Shoar was, That the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT> and four Companies of Soldiers were to be taken on board the <IT>Revolution</IT>; That Corn and Cattle were provided for the said Soldiers; and that the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT> was within a short Day's Journey of <IT>Sancto Andero</IT>; That hereupon the first and second Mate of the said Ship, suspecting <IT>Gallwey</IT> to be engaged in some unwarrantable Design, agreed not to serve any longer, unless <IT>Gallwey</IT> would give them a Note under his Hand, that they were forced into the Service, and would also declare whither they were bound, and give them Security that they should not be employed in any other Voyage than such as he should de&rehy;clare to them; whereupon one of them was confined, and the other dis&rehy;countenanced by <IT>Gallwey</IT>.</P>
<P>But that <IT>Gallwey's</IT> real Expectations were to have come over with the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT>, appears to the Committee most evident from the <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">39.</NOTE> Copy of a Letter of his, dated the 16th of <IT>June</IT>, the Day before he set Sail from <IT>Cadiz</IT>, in which are these Words, <Q>"I hope the &horfill; will sail To-morrow; your not repeating Orders and Advice concerning the Business in Hand gives me a thousand Apprehensions; God send our Bankers and the rest of our Friends are safe, and stand their Ground. I intend to Embark my-self on Board the &horfill; for fear <IT>my Dear Aunt</IT> should have any Occasion for Assistance, of whom I am so tender that I would not if possible have the Care of her put into any other Hands.</Q></P>
<P>The Committee observe that the same Expression of <IT>My Aunt</IT> is used in the Letter to <IT>Dodsworth</IT> with such Circumstances as make it highly pro&rehy;bable that in that <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">AA. 6.</NOTE> Letter, as well as this of <IT>Gallwey's</IT>, it denotes the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT>. They likewise observe, that the Names of <IT>Manfield</IT> and <IT>Medley</IT> are used in <IT>Morgan's</IT> and <IT>Gallwey's</IT> Letters in such a Manner, as confirms those Names to mean the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde</IT>, agreeable to the Explication given them in the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons.</P>
<P><IT>Gallwey</IT> in his <NOTE N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">42.</NOTE> Letter of the 3d of <IT>November</IT> 1722, says, He has a couple of fine Grey-hounds, a Dog and a Bitch, for Mr. <IT>Freeman</IT>; the same Dogs are mentioned in <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">19.</NOTE> another Letter and in the <NOTE
N="&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="margin">47,48</NOTE> Depositions of two of the Sailors to have been a Present from the late Duke of <IT>Ormonde, to the Pretender</IT>; which confirms the Explication of the Name of <IT>Freeman</IT>, men&rehy;tioned in the said Report, to be true.</P>
<P>There was likewise seized on board the <IT>Revolution</IT>, a <NOTE

<P>The Lords Committees conceive, that the several Particulars above re&rehy;lated, will appear to the House very much to corroborate the Accounts received from Abroad of Ships provided for transporting the late Duke of <IT>Ormond</IT> to <IT>England</IT>, with Arms and Officers, the beginning of last Summer; and that they also confirm the Decyphering of the Letters, and Expli&rehy;cation of the Names, contained in the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons.</P>
<P>The Lords Committees observing that some Paragraphs of the Letters referr'd to them were writ originally in Cypher, thought it proper to call the Decypherers before them, in order to their being satisfied of the Truth of the Decyphering. The Account they receiv'd from those Persons, was, that they have long been versed in this Science, and are ready to produce Witnesses of undoubted Reputation, who have framed Letters in Cy&rehy;pher, on purpose to put them to a Tryal, and have constantly found their decyphering to agree with the Original Keys which had been concealed from them; it was likewise confirmed to the Committee, that Letters de<PB
N="10">cyphered by one or other of them in <IT>England</IT>, had exactly agreed with the decyphering of the same Letters performed by Persons in foreign Parts, with whom they could have no Communication; and that in some In&rehy;stances after they had decyphered Letters for the Government, the Keys of those Cyphers had been seized, and upon comparing them, had agreed ex&rehy;actly with their decyphering.</P>
<P>With respect to the intercepted Letters in Question, they alledged that in the Cypher used by <IT>George Kelly</IT>, they find the Words ranged in an alphabetical Order, answering the progressive Order of the Figures by which they are expressed, so that the farther the initial Letter of any Word is removed from the Letter A, the higher the Number is by which such Word is denoted; that the same Word will be found to be constantly denoted by one and the same Figure, except in the Case of Particles or Words of very frequent Use, which have two or three Figures assign'd to them, but those always following one the other in a progressive Order. They likewise set forth, that in the Cypher above-mention'd a certain Order is constantly observed as to the placing of the Words made use of, that under each Letter of the Alphabet the first Cyphers are allotted to the proper Names of Places, the next to the proper Names or Titles of Persons, the next to whole Words in common Use, and the last to denote single Letters.</P>
<P>As to the Truth of the Decyphering, they alledged that several Let&rehy;ters written in this Cypher had been decyphered by them separately, one being many Miles distant in the Country, and the other in Town, and yet their decyphering agreed; that Facts unknown to them and the Govern&rehy;ment at the time of their decyphering had been verified in every Cir&rehy;cumstance by subsequent Discoveries, as particularly that of <IT>H&horfill;'s</IT> Ship coming in Ballast to fetch <IT>O&horfill;</IT> to <IT>England</IT>, which had been so decy&rehy;phered by them two Months before the Government had the least notice of <IT>Halstead's</IT> having left <IT>England</IT>: That a Supplement to this Cypher ha&rehy;ving been found among <IT>Dennis Kelly's</IT> Papers the latter end of <IT>July</IT>, agreed with the Key they had formed of that Cypher the <IT>April</IT> before: That the decyphering of the Letters signed <IT>Jones, Illington</IT>, and 1378, being afterwards applied by them to others written in the same Cypher, did im&rehy;mediately make pertinent Sense, and such as had an evident Connexion and Coherence with the Parts of those Letters that were out of Cypher, tho' the Words in Cypher were repeated in different Paragraphs and dif&rehy;ferently combined. And they insist that these several Particulars duely weighed amount to a Demonstration of the Truth of their decyphering.</P>
<P>As to the other Cyphers made use of by <IT>Jernegan, Stanley</IT>, and <IT>Walter Grahame</IT>, they consist only of twenty four Figures , for the twenty four Letters of the Alphabet, and some other Figures for proper Names or whole Words, in the placing of which Names a certain Order is also ob&rehy;served.</P>
<P>These several Particulars they declared themselves ready to attest upon Oath, and to produce sufficient Witnesses to their Character and Integrity as well as their Skill.</P>
<P>The Committee being empowered by your Lordships to examine <IT>Chri&rehy;stopher Layer</IT>, did accordingly spend some time in the said Examination, which produced a tedious Repetition of the Particulars contained in his Ex&rehy;amination before the Committee of the House of Commons, and some few Circumstances which they found he had recollected by reading the printed Report and Appendix.</P>
<P>All that he confessed to them which is new, was, that he did before his setting out for <IT>Rome</IT> acquaint <IT>Plunket</IT> with his Intentions of carrying over a Note of the Names of the Tory Gentlemen of <IT>Norfolk</IT>, if <IT>Plunket</IT> thought it would be acceptable; that during his Stay at <IT>Rome</IT>, Sir <IT>William Ellis</IT> told him, that he had formerly corresponded with <IT>Plunket</IT> at the Request of the Lady <IT>Middleton</IT>, but that he had not for some time past corresponded <PB
N="11">with <IT>Plunket</IT>, or any one else, in relation to the Pretender's Affairs; for that from the time of the Action at <IT>Dumblain</IT> so many <IT>Scottish</IT> Noblemen and Gentlemen had come over to the Pretender, that he and all the rest of the old Servants had been forbid all Correspondence in <IT>England</IT>, or elsewhere. Upon <IT>Layer's</IT> desiring leave to correspond with him if it were practicable, he told <IT>Layer</IT>, that on Condition he would promise to write nothing but what might be shewn to the Pretender himself, he would settle a Corre&rehy;spondence with him; for that tho' he had followed the Fortunes of the late King <IT>James</IT> and his Family, ever since the Revolution; and had always been faithful to the Pretender, and for many Years his Cashier, yet if any of the <IT>Scottish</IT> Gentlemen that were about the Pretender should know he received a Letter without communicating it to him, it would cost him his Place, and he should be in utter Disgrace: That <IT>Layer</IT> promising to write nothing but what might be shewn, <IT>Ellis</IT> gave him a Cypher of his own Hand-writing, as also another Cypher of cut Paper for carrying on the Corre&rehy;spondence; that he <IT>Layer</IT> likewise settled a Cypher of fictitious Names with Mrs. <IT>Hughes</IT>, Nurse to the Pretender's Child, and received a Letter from her in relation to the Christening of his Daughter. He would not own that he knew of any other Cypher, and persisted that Mrs. <IT>Kin&rehy;der</IT> meant the said Mrs. <IT>Hughes</IT>, tho' in <IT>Ellis's</IT> Cypher it stands for Mrs. <IT>Fox</IT>. He said that the Paper which he desired a Copy of from Sir <IT>William Ellis</IT>, and which is referred to in <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">BY. 38.</NOTE> <IT>Ellis's</IT> Letter of the 30th of <IT>January</IT>, was a short Scheme relating to the <IT>Preston</IT> Affair shewn him by <IT>Ellis</IT> while he was at <IT>Rome</IT>, of which he remembers no other Particulars, but that Insurrections were to be begun in several Counties in a dark Night. That when he made Application to <IT>Plunket</IT> for the fictitious Names of <IT>Bur&rehy;ford, Steele, &amp;c.</IT> he was forced to acquaint <IT>Plunket</IT> with his having settled a Correspondence with <IT>Ellis</IT>, which <IT>Plunket</IT> resented, and said he thought <IT>Ellis</IT> had been forbid all Correspondence with Persons here. That the Reason of his asking <IT>Plunket</IT> for a fictitious Name for Lord <IT>Orrery</IT>, was that he had occasion to mention to <IT>Ellis</IT> a Club which <IT>Plunket</IT> had often told him of; That <IT>Plunket</IT> once shewed him a List of this Club of his own Hand-writing, which he read over two or three times, but that <IT>Plunket</IT> talk&rehy;ed so inconsistently of them, that he <IT>Layer</IT> verily believes it was a mere Fi&rehy;ction of his own, and that there never was any such Club. That he <IT>Layer</IT> thinks Lord <IT>Orrery</IT> mentioned to him Lord <IT>Strafford</IT>, as one of those who, with Lord <IT>North</IT>, Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT>, and others, were (as Lord <IT>Orrery</IT> was informed) going to do a rash thing in favour of the Pretender; but that he cannot be positive as to Lord <IT>Strafford</IT>. That he <IT>Layer</IT> wrote himself to the Pretender, concerning the Difference of Opinion which he observed in Lord <IT>North</IT> and Lord <IT>Orrery</IT> about the Means of restoring him and the Necessity there was that the Regent should permit General <IT>Dillon</IT> to come over here with some foreign Forces. That he also drew up a Scheme of a Lottery to have been opened here in favour of the Pretender, and en&rehy;closed the said Scheme in a Parcel with some Silk Stockings which he sent as a Present to the Pretender and his Spouse, by <IT>Andrew Haye</IT>, who travelled to <IT>Italy</IT> with Alderman <IT>Barber</IT>. That he delivered this Parcel to <IT>Haye</IT> with his own Hands, who promised to convey it to <IT>Ellis</IT>, and said he could do it with Safety. That <IT>Haye</IT>, as he believes, understood the Stockings to be for the Pretender and his Spouse; That he likewise had some Discourse with <IT>Haye</IT> about getting Copper Plates engraved at <IT>Rome</IT> in <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> and <IT>Italian</IT> for the Tickets of the said Lottery, and desired him to re&rehy;ceive Sir <IT>William Ellis</IT>'s Directions about it, which <IT>Haye</IT> promised to do. That while he <IT>Layer</IT> was at <IT>Rome, Haye</IT> asked him whether he would not see the King, meaning the Pretender; and that the said <IT>Haye</IT> went fre&rehy;quently to the Pretender's Family in the way of his Business, and was, as he believes, present while the Pretender's and his Spouse's Pictures were drawn.</P>
<PB N="12"><P><IT>Haye</IT> being examined by the Committee, owned the Receit of the Stockings, but denied their being delivered to him by <IT>Layer</IT>, or that he knew who they were for. He likewise owned the carrying a Packet to <IT>Belloni</IT>, the Banker at <IT>Rome</IT>, which was brought to him by a Porter from <IT>Layer</IT>, as he supposed.
</P><P><IT>Layer</IT> owns, that <IT>Haye</IT> told him <IT>Belloni</IT> was the Pretender's Banker, but denies his sending any such Packet by <IT>Haye</IT>; and in several other Particu&rehy;lars of their Examinations they contradicted each other.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">1.</NOTE> A Scheme of the Lottery above-mentioned (for raising 225,000 Pounds Sterling) having been found among the Papers of <IT>Walter Jefferyes</IT>, now in Custody, the Lords Committees thought proper to examine him now he came by it; he owned his being acquainted with <IT>Layer</IT> and <IT>Plunket</IT>, that he saw <IT>Layer</IT> about the time of his going abroad, and helped him to a Bill on a Banker at <IT>Antwerp</IT>; but he denied his knowing from whom he received the said Scheme, or his having had any Conversation with any one about it, and said it might be put into his Hands by <IT>Plunket</IT>, for ought he knew, but that he was not sure he had ever read it, and if he had known such a Paper had been in his Custody he should have destroyed it.</P>
<P>The Lords Committees being informed that <IT>Layer</IT>, between the time of his delivering the larger and lesser Bundle of Papers to Mrs. <IT>Mason</IT>, had deliver'd to her a large Parcel covered with blue Paper and sealed in several Places, and that he did within a few Days after take it back again, telling her he wanted to carry it to Lord <IT>North</IT> and <IT>Grey's</IT>, they examined <IT>Layer</IT> particularly on this head, but he denied that he ever delivered her any such Bundle.</P>
<P>The Lords Committees next proceeded to the Examination of <IT>John Plunket</IT>, who began with large Protestations of his Innocence, and offered of himself to account for three Facts charged upon him in the Report, and to shew they were great Mistakes. The first was, his receiving a Let&rehy;ter from <IT>George Kelly</IT>; the second, his receiving the Letter at <IT>Antwerp</IT>, signed <IT>Dixwell</IT>; and the third, his receiving the Letter from the Pretender, taken at Mrs. <IT>Creagh's</IT>. And as in his Examination before the Committee of the House of Commons he had fallen on the Expedient of substitu&rehy;ting <IT>Hugh Thomas</IT> to personate <IT>Rogers</IT>, so now they found he had fur&rehy;nished himself with three different Persons, at different Places, all of the Name of <IT>Plunket</IT>, to whom he would have it believed these Letters were written, without offering any the least Proof or Circumstance of Pro&rehy;bability to shew that such Persons were at all concerned in those Letters, or that there ever were any such Persons in being.</P>
<P>The Letter from <IT>George Kelly</IT>, he said was not writ to him, but to one <IT>Harry Plunket</IT>, who delivered it to him at <IT>Will's</IT> Coffee-House, <IT>Covent&rehy;Garden</IT>, and that it related to some Money that was to be raised on a Secu&rehy;rity of Mrs. <IT>Barnes's</IT>.</P>
<P>As to the Letter signed <IT>Dixwell</IT>, he said, there were two Clergymen of the Church of <IT>Rome</IT>, one or both of which travelled with him and <IT>Layer</IT>, from <IT>Dover</IT> to <IT>Antwerp</IT>; that one of them went by the Name of <IT>Loyd</IT>, but his real Name was <IT>Plunket</IT>. That this Man dropped the Letter signed <IT>Dixwell</IT>, at a Coffee-House, and he <IT>John Plunket</IT> taking it up with a design of restoring it to him in <IT>Lorrain</IT>, (to which place sometimes one and some&rehy;times both of these Clergymen were gone) shewed it to <IT>Layer</IT>, who took it into his Head that this Letter had been writ to him <IT>John Plunket</IT>.</P>
<P>The Letter from the Pretender, he said, fell into his Hands much in the same manner; that there is one Father <IT>Plunket</IT> at <IT>Rome</IT>, to whom the Pretender always writes when any Body is to be introduced to him. Being asked whether Father <IT>Plunket</IT> travelled with <IT>Layer</IT> to <IT>Rome</IT>, (because mention is made in the Pretender's Letter of a Companion of <IT>Plunket's</IT>) he said the Pretender always called the Person that was to be introduced by Father <IT>Plunket</IT>, his Companion. That this Father <IT>Plunket</IT> happening to shew him this Letter, and commending the Hand , he <IT>John Plunket</IT> <PB
N="13">said he had a Friend at <IT>Rome</IT>, that would be glad to see the Pretender's Hand writing. And Father <IT>Plunket</IT> having accordingly left the Letter with him, he shewed it to <IT>Layer</IT>, and forgot to return it to Father <IT>Plun&rehy;ket</IT>, who never called for it, having fifty more Letters of the same kind by him.</P>
<P>Upon the Lords Committees asking him whether he went by the Name of <IT>Rogers</IT>, he said he went by several Names in his Travels, that he might not be imposed upon in his Reckonings, as the <IT>English</IT> generally are. Being asked whether he took the Name of <IT>Rogers</IT> to prevent his be&rehy;ing thought an <IT>Englishman</IT>, he said that in <IT>Italy</IT> he was called <IT>Ro&rehy;gieri</IT>.</P>
<P>They farther asked him, whether he had dictated any fictitious Names to <IT>Layer</IT>, or had mentioned any thing to him of a <IT>Club</IT>; to which he answered, that he had given <IT>Layer</IT> the fictitious Name of <IT>Bedford</IT> or <IT>Bur&rehy;ford</IT>, for Lord <IT>Orrery</IT>, which Name he had from <IT>Neynoe</IT>. That one Night being in Company with <IT>Layer</IT>, and some Clergymen whose Names he has forgot, the Discourse turning on the Protests of the Lords, and the Names that were subscribed to them, one of the Company said, These are a Loyal Club; another said, They are Jacobites; and that he <IT>Plunket</IT> said there was a Loyal Club of eighty or ninety Lords who would stand in Defence of their Country.</P>
<P>He farther observed to the Committee, that in the Bill now depending before your Lordships, he is not mentioned by the Name by which he was baptized and confirmed; he said his Sirname was <IT>Plucknet</IT>, but his Christian Name he declined telling; and seemed to place some Hopes and Confi&rehy;dence in this Subterfuge.</P>
<P>The Committee finding him trifle with them in this egregious manner, asked him in general, whether he had ever been in Conference with the Pretender, or had corresponded with him, or any of his Agents; to which he answered in the Negative.</P>
<P>The Committee next sent for <IT>George Kelly</IT>, who told them that the Af&rehy;fair being soon to be brought before your Lordships, he desired to be excused from answering any Questions; so that they had no Opportunity of examining him as to the new Matters alledged against him in the De&rehy;positions of Mr. <IT>Philip Caryll</IT> and others.</P>
<P>However they thought it proper to send for the said Mr. <IT>Caryll</IT>, and to ask him whether he had any thing to add to or retract from his former Accounts. His Depositions being read over to him, he expressed himself very Angry and Uneasy at their being made Publick, and told the Com&rehy;mittee he was not disposed to answer any farther Questions, being sorry for what he had said already; he likewise insinuated, that what he had said had not been taken down exactly as he dictated it, and seemed appre&rehy;hensive that he was called upon to accuse himself of Matters that might be prejudicial to him. But upon the Committee's telling him that the most effectual way he could take to do himself Service, was to make a candid and ingenuous Discovery of the whole Truth, he said he had already given a candid Account, and hoped he should not have been a Sufferer for his Candour. Being asked whether his Depositions had not been read over to him before he signed them, he said they were; but that he was in a great Confusion at the time they were taken: Being then required by the Committee to read them over himself, and to shew in what Particulars they vary from his Sense and Meaning, he grew more composed; and ha&rehy;ving read over the first, dated the 27th of <IT>March</IT>, said, he believed it was right enough; in reading over the second (dated the 29th of <IT>March</IT>) he said it was not strictly true that Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> had <IT>told him</IT> what is there related, concerning an Invasion, Commission, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> but that it was true, he had heard Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> say so; that as to Lord <IT>Lansdown's</IT> being to Land in the <IT>West</IT>, he could not be positive, but he thinks Sir <IT>Harry Go&rehy;ring</IT> said so; he said, it was but a Supposition of his own, that the Discourse <PB
N="14">which occasioned the Bishop of <IT>Rochester's</IT> taking Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> by the Collar, related to the Pretender's Affairs; but that he remembers very well, Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> did affirm, that on his saying the Words there re&rehy;cited, this is Rocking the Cradle indeed<SIC>)</SIC> the Bishop did take him by the Collar, and that he, <IT>Caryll</IT>, did <IT>Apprehend</IT> the said Discourse to have Relation to the Pretender's Affairs. He said it was about two Years ago that being at Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT>'s he saw a Letter lye on his Scrutore, directed to Mr. <IT>Hore</IT>, and upon his asking Sir <IT>Harry</IT> who the said Letter was for, Sir <IT>Harry</IT> told him it was writ to himself; he said that the Words in his Deposition which Import, that he, <IT>Caryll, had Reason to believe Kelly</IT> and Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> were settling together a Key at his House at <IT>North</IT>, by which they might Correspond, are too strong; for that he, <IT>Caryll</IT>, did not see any such Key, only it was his Suspicion and Thought at that time that they were framing such a Key.</P>
<P>He likewise said, that what relates to <IT>Boyce</IT> in the said Deposition is rather stronger than he meant it, for that <IT>Boyce</IT> only told him he was afraid the Servant he <IT>Caryll</IT> had sent to him to help off was <IT>Sample</IT>, alledging this Reason, that he had observed he was disguised, and that he was afraid he was somewhat like the Description given of <IT>Sample</IT> in the Proclamation. All the other Particulars of his Depositions he averred to be true, but said, he had nothing farther to add, and that he would rather a thousand times die in <IT>Newgate</IT>, than be an Evidence.</P>
<P><IT>Boyce</IT>, being examined by the Committee, owned that Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> went to <IT>France</IT> in his Yatch, and that a Servant went over with him in a Black Whig, whom he had never seen with Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> before; but he utterly denyed his having conveyed over any Person sent to him by Mr. <IT>Caryll</IT>, or his having had any Discourse with <IT>Caryll</IT> about any Per&rehy;son's answering the Description of <IT>Sample</IT>.</P>
<P>The Committee having summoned before them <IT>William Beasing</IT>, of <IT>Horn Dean</IT>, and having read to him his former Depositions, find that he retracts what he had there deposed on Oath, of<IT>Caryll</IT> and Sir <IT>Harry Gorring</IT>'s being in Company at his House with the Person who had but one Hand; he says, such a Person was at his House with two other Gentle&rehy;men, but that he now recollects <IT>Caryll</IT> and Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT> were not there at that time. Being asked whether he had received any Letter or Message, since his being in Custody, which had helped to set him right in this Particular, he answered in the Negative.</P>
<P>The Committee observe from the Parts of Mr. <IT>Caryll's</IT> Depositions which he affirmed, that the Explication given to the Name of <IT>Hore</IT>, in the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons, as also the De&rehy;cyphering of that part of <IT>Kelly's</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">E. 35.</NOTE> Letter which mentions <IT>Hore's</IT> Com&rehy;mission, and the Conjecture of <IT>Goring's</IT> having carried over a new Cypher from <IT>Kelly</IT> to <IT>France</IT>, are very much confirmed. They likewise ob&rehy;serve that what is said in <IT>Glascock's</IT> <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">E. 79.</NOTE> Letter to <IT>Kelley</IT> of the 20/31 of <IT>October</IT>, concerning the Arrival of the little <IT>French</IT> Merchant, mentioned by <IT>Kel&rehy;ly</IT>, and the Precaution they intend to use in relation to him till some other appears with whom they may talk of Business more to the Purpose, has probably relation to <IT>Sample's</IT> being got safe to <IT>France</IT>. And the Letters signed <IT>Fra. Phillips</IT>, which <IT>Caryll</IT> owns he received from <IT>Kelly</IT>, not not only confirms <IT>Kelly's</IT> writing by fictitious Names, but is a strong Argument of his being the Person that writ the <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">E. 75.</NOTE> Letter to <IT>Bonnaville</IT> of the 27th of <IT>September</IT>, and consequently the other Letters charged upon him, in the Report. For as in his Letter to <IT>Caryll</IT>, he says: <Q>"<IT>I have never heard a Syllable</IT> from your other Lawyer, (Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT>) since you and I were with him, which you'll say <IT>is pretty surprizing</IT> and am afraid very <IT>Detrimental</it></q>. &horfill; so in that to <IT>Bonnaville</IT> (writ within five Days of the other) he says, <q><it>I have not heard a Syllable</IT> from <IT>D. Gainer</IT>, or <IT>G. Roberts</IT>, since Mr. <IT>G. Sampson</IT> went, which has <PB
N="15">been a great <IT>Surprize</IT>, and I may say no small <IT>Detriment</IT>, to some of their Friends."</Q></P>
<P>This Identity of Expression, in two Letters writ so near the same time, appears to be a farther Confirmation that the same Person writ them both, and confirms <IT>G. Sampson</IT> to be the same with the <IT>other Lawyer</IT>, which <IT>Caryll</IT> has explained to mean Sir <IT>Harry Goring</IT>.</P>
<P>The Lords Committees also find in the Papers referred to them new Evi&rehy;dence of <IT>Kelly's</IT> visiting, writing to and receiving Letters from the Bishop of <IT>Rochester</IT>, as appears by <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">13,14.</NOTE> Affidavits from the Persons who carryed <IT>Kelly</IT> to the Bishop's House, and who also delivered Letters from him to the Bishop, and brought back the Bishop's Answers; and Mrs. <IT>Levett</IT> <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">11.</NOTE> deposes on Oath, that Mrs. <IT>Barnes</IT> has told her <IT>Kelly</IT> received in one Day as many Letters from abroad as came to fourteen or fifteen Shillings, the Directions of which she <IT>Barnes</IT> saw, but they were in such odd fictitious Names, as no one could find out but <IT>Kelly</IT>, who had the Key; that among these Letters there was one for the Bishop of <IT>Rochester</IT>, (as <IT>Kelly</IT> told her) which he was at that time, gone to deliver to the Bishop. And <IT>John Malone</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">12.</NOTE> deposes, that among the Letters which he carryed from <IT>Kelly</IT> to the Post, there were some directed to <IT>Waters</IT> the Banker at <IT>Paris</IT>, under whose Cover it appears that most of the Treasonable Letters were sent, and the original <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">E. 21.</NOTE> Letter in <IT>Kelly's</IT> own Hand stopt at the Post-Office was inclosed in a Cover so directed. Mrs. <IT>Levett</IT> farther <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">11.</NOTE> deposes, that Mrs. <IT>Barnes</IT> told her, under Secrecy, that the Dog sent from <IT>France</IT> was a Present <IT>from the late Lord Marr</IT>, to the Bishop of <IT>Rochester's</IT> Lady; which is in some mea&rehy;sure confirmed by the Draught of the Affidavit prepared for <IT>Birming&rehy;ham</IT> at <IT>Paris</IT>, in which he is desired to swear that <IT>Lord Marr</IT> knew nothing of any such Dog; and though this Affidavit does not appear to have been sent over by <IT>Kelly</IT> directly, yet express Mention is made in the Letter to <IT>Gordon</IT>, that the said Affidavit is the Copy of a Note from the Person concerned, with the Substance of what <IT>he thinks requisite</IT>. This Circumstance of the Dog's having been sent by the late <IT>Lord Marr</IT>, which is not expresly alledged in any part of the Report of the Com&rehy;mittee of the House of Commons, is a new Confirmation that the <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">E. 32.</NOTE> Letter signed 918, which mentions the sending the Dog, is from <IT>Marr</IT>; and that <IT>Musgrave</IT>, to whom the Receipt of the Dog is acknowledged in <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">E. 35,42.</NOTE> two several Letters, is likewise a Name denoting <IT>Marr</IT>, agreeably to what is asserted in the said Report.</P>
<P>The Committee find by <NOTE N="&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="margin">15,16.</NOTE> two Affidavits referred to them, that <IT>George Kelly</IT>, the last time he was taken into Custody, offered the Woman of the House a Gold Watch, forty Guineas in Money, and a Note for forty Pounds more, to let him escape.</P>
<P>The Committee have laid the Substance of these several Examinations together, as having some Reference to <IT>George Kelly</IT>.</P>
<P>They likewise examined Mr. <IT>Dennis Kelly</IT>, who utterly denied his be&rehy;ing advised with, or knowing any thing relating to any Conspiracy. Se&rehy;veral Papers found in his Custody being shewn to him, he denied his having ever seen them before, except when some of them were shewn to him at former Examinations.</P>
<P>They next sent for Captain <IT>Pancier</IT>, and having ordered his <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">D. 1,2.</NOTE> former De&rehy;positions to be read to him, ask'd him whether he had any thing to Add, or Retract; he affirmed every Part thereof to be true, and said he had only this farther Particular to add, That having lately seen <IT>George Kelly</IT>, as he was brought down to the House of Commons, he recollects that he has of&rehy;ten seen him at the Gaming-Tables with <IT>Skeene</IT>, and that <IT>Skeene</IT> and the said <IT>Kelly</IT> were intimately accquainted, as he is able to prove by several Wit&rehy;nesses of Credit. <IT>Skeene</IT> being call'd in, and having heard <IT>Pancier's</IT> Depositi&rehy;ons read over to him, own'd, That he was acquainted with <IT>Pancier</IT>, and had been in Company with him at several of the Times and Places menti&rehy;on'd in the said Depositions; That he was taken Prisoner in the <IT>Preston</IT> <PB
N="16">Rebellion, but is not related to <IT>Marr</IT>, nor has ever seen <IT>Mackintosh</IT> since he parted from him at <IT>High-gate</IT>: He own'd he had had general Discourse with <IT>Pancier</IT> relating to a Plot, and that <IT>Pancier</IT> had ask'd him several Questi&rehy;ons about it, to some of which he (<IT>Skeene</IT>) assented, and to others not; but he deny'd his having told <IT>Pancier</IT> any farther Particulars than were in the News Papers, or in the Current Report of the Town. As for Instance, when <IT>Pancier</IT> asked him where the late Duke of <IT>Ormond</IT> was, he told him the News-Papers said he was at <IT>Corunna</IT>; but he <IT>positively</IT> de&rehy;nied his having ever mentioned to <IT>Pancier</IT> any <IT>Particular Persons</IT> as con&rehy;cerned in the Conspiracy, or any of the <IT>Particular Facts</IT> specified in his Depositions.</P>
<P>He farther said, he had reason to believe that <IT>Pancier</IT> had sent to him since his being in Custody, to advise him to make his Escape, for that one <IT>Gerrard Fitzgerald</IT> having been walking with <IT>Pancier</IT> in the <IT>Park</IT>, came di&rehy;rectly from thence to him, <IT>Skeene</IT>, at the Messenger's House, and advised him to make his Escape; tho' he owned that <IT>Fitzgerald</IT> made no mention of <IT>Pancier's</IT> having sent him any such Advice.</P>
<P><IT>Fitzgerald</IT> being sent for by the Committee, owned he had been to see <IT>Skeene</IT>, and finding no body at that time in the House but a Woman, told <IT>Skeene</IT> it would be an easy Matter for him to escape; but he cleared <IT>Pan&rehy;cier</IT> from having sent any such Intimation or Advice. He farther said, that <IT>Skeene</IT> told him he did not know but he might have talk'd foolishly to <IT>Pancier</IT>, but that if he had, <IT>Pancier</IT> was but a single Evidence, or to that effect.</P>
<P>The Committee find, among the Papers referred to them, a <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">7.</NOTE> Copy of the Orders which <IT>Arnold</IT> received from the Owners of the Ship <IT>Phineas</IT>, requiring him to follow the Directions of <IT>Roger Nowell (Halstead</IT>) during the Voyage; as also an <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">8.</NOTE> Affidavit, by which it appears, That the said <IT>Halstead</IT> was to visit the Bishop of <IT>Rochester</IT>, and staid an Hour at his House, a few Days before his setting out for <IT>Bilboa</IT>.</P>
<P>They also find a very remarkable <NOTE N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">6.</NOTE> Letter to one of the Secretaries of State, by an unknown Hand, dated the 12th of <IT>February</IT>, 1721-22, and inclosed in <NOTE
N="&cross;" PLACE="margin">5.</NOTE> one, dated the 31st of <IT>March</IT>; which first appears to be the Letter referred to in <NOTE
N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">E. 9.</NOTE> one of <IT>Neynoe's</IT> Examinations, as drawn up by <IT>Kelly</IT> and himself, and brought back to him corrected, as he believ'd, by the Bishop of <IT>Rochester</IT>.</P>
<P>They likewise find a <NOTE N="&dcross;" PLACE="margin">2.</NOTE> Paper taken in Lord <IT>North</IT> and <IT>Grey's</IT> Study at <IT>Catlige</IT>, which contains several very extraordinary Reasonings on the Nature of Oaths; tending to prove, That the Oaths to the present Government are not Obligatory, and that tho' the taking such Oaths is in its self un&rehy;lawful, and a grievous Sin, as being inconsistent with Prior Oaths, or Obligations, yet neither the taking nor breaking them can in strictness fall un&rehy;der the Denomination of Perjury.</P>
<P>This is the Substance of what the Committee have been able to collect from a careful Perusal of the Papers referred to them and a long Exami&rehy;nation of several of the Persons concerned, in some of whose Power they have Reason to believe it was to have made ample Discoveries, if they had been disposed to speak the Truth.</P>
<P>And tho' the Lords Committees cannot reflect, without Pity and Com&rehy;passion, on the misguided Zeal, and wretched Infatuation of those Men, who rather chuse to expose themselves to the greatest Dangers, than to discover the Authors or Accomplices of their Treasons; thereby declaring to the World, that the Leagues and Confederacies of private Villany are dearer and more sacred to them than the strongest Tyes and Obligations of Society; yet the Committee make no doubt but the Matters contained in the Report referred to them, and corroberated by the Result of their pre&rehy;sent Enquiry, will appear to your Lordships so clearly made out, that the Conspirators, sooner or later, will have leisure to repent of the rash and impious Choice they have made, of being rather true to one another, than to God, their Consciences, and their Country.</P>
