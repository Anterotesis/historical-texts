<HEAD>THE <BO>EQUITY</BO> OF PARLIAMENTS, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></HEAD>
<p>&Iic; Acknowledge my self a Person so retir'd, that the late Pamphlet, Inti&rehy;tled, <IT>The Crisis</IT>, though it treats on the important Subject of <IT>Property</IT>, might have escaped my Perusal, if it had not come to my Hand by the <IT>Penny-Post</IT>; per&rehy;haps, from some conscientious <IT>Senator</IT>, to check, and reprove me for having early dis&rehy;coursed, and concerned my self on this Subject of the <IT>Annuities</IT>, and for having promoted the <IT>Proposal</IT> of the <IT>South-Sea Company</IT>; I had heard such a Pamphlet was publish'd by the Governour of the Company of <IT>Comedians</IT>, therefore (as I had also at that time no lei<PB
N="4">sure) I slighted the Pamphlet, and laid it aside, expecting no extraordinary Performance on a Subject of this Nature from a Person so <IT>em&rehy;ploy'd</IT>; but by Chance observing soon after the well-known Name of the Author, I im&rehy;mediately read the Treatise.
</P><P><SC>This</SC> <IT>second Crisis</IT>, in the beginning of it, falls something foul on the ingenious Mr. <IT>A. H.</IT> because of the <IT>Estimate</IT> that Gentle&rehy;man publish'd of the <IT>National Debt</IT>, and the Remarks which were subjoin'd to some <IT>Cal&rehy;culations</IT> made in <IT>April</IT> 1717. This ingenious Gentleman assiduously attends the Service of his Country in Parliament; and at this time, especially, when the publick Debts and Ac&rehy;counts lie on the Table, may probably not be at leisure to publish any Thing further on this Subject, though his Words are quoted relating to the Funds; and his Thoughts and Reasoning thereon, openly Arraigned by our Author.</P>
<P><SC>I shall</SC> however touch but lightly what&rehy;ever respects the <IT>Calculation</IT>, and Arguments, grounded on the Topick of Profit and Loss; but shall keep to the more <IT>exalted Subject</IT> of Sir <IT>R&horfill;'s</IT> Treatise; a Subject sufficiently co&rehy;pious (<IT>viz.) The Law of Equity</IT>! A Law that demands out highest Regard, and strictest Conformity! A Law Sacred, Eternal, and Immutable!</P>
<P><SC>To</SC> undertake what relates to the accompt&rehy;ing Part, is indeed needless, after having been so well perform'd in the said celebrated <PB
N="5"><IT>Schemes</IT>, and <IT>Remarks</IT>; which have also been Revised, and in some Things amended by the accurate and elaborate Pen of Mr. <IT>Crookshanks</IT>; but these Schemes relate only to the <IT>Exche&rehy;quer</IT> and Parliamentary Funds.</P>
<P><SC>Sir</SC> <IT>R&horfill;</IT> would instruct us in the more universal Dealings between Merchants, whe&rehy;ther of the same, or different Nations, and likewise between sovereign Powers, and their own Subjects, or the Subjects of other Princes. If I should presume to meddle in these Things, Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT> who is rightfully in Possession of this Part of the Subject in Question, may esteem me a <IT>Trespasser</IT>, and thus I should ha&rehy;zard being attacked by both these Champi&rehy;ons; each skilful at his Pen! Each a Veteran of such Abilities, that I am very sensible they can do what they please with a <IT>Feather</IT>; a dangerous Weapon in some Hands! They Combat also both of them under the <IT>Buckler</IT>, the broad Shield of their Right of <IT>Session</IT> in the <IT>Senate House</IT>. I am a naked Man, a weak Opponent; a Shadow when compar'd with the <IT>Nestorian Race</IT> of the <IT>Iron-sides</IT>, now an <IT>Equestrian House</IT>; therefore with due Sub&rehy;mission, though without Fear or Despondency, I enter the Lists, relying on that <IT>supream Power</IT> to which Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> has Appealed; <IT>EQUITY</IT> is my Guard, and if that can&rehy;not defend me, I am sure to be foil'd, and am already disarm'd.</P>
<P><SC>Sir</SC> <IT>R&horfill;</IT> begins with a long <IT>Paragraph</IT>, which he mentions to be taken out of Mr. <PB
N="6"><IT>Hutchinson's Remarks</IT>; and wherein it is said, <Q>"That if the <IT>Annuitants</IT> were to account in <IT>Chancery</IT> as Mortgagees at 6. <IT>per Cent.</IT> Inte&rehy;rest, after the common Method of making up such Accounts, a large Sum will be due from the <IT>Lender</IT> to the <IT>Borrower</IT> even to the amount of 30. <IT>per Cent.</IT> at that time above Principal and Interest, instead of re&rehy;ceiving any Thing further from the Pub&rehy;lick.</Q> But the <IT>Equity</IT> of doing this doth not appear to me to be either recommended or asserted by the Author of the <IT>Remarks</IT>; nei&rehy;ther is the Re-purchasing of these Funds any otherwise mentioned, <Q>"than as a Matter which had been first opened on the Occasion of a Scheme for <IT>Redemption</IT> of the <IT>Publick Funds</IT>, which was made Publick before Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT> publish'd his Schemes.</Q> In this long Paragraph it is also mentioned, <Q>"That there had been an Attempt the then last Session for obtaining an Act which should have redu&rehy;ced the <IT>National Interest</IT> to 4. <IT>per Cent.</it></q> And in this Paragraph Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT> says further, <Q>"That if the Parliament should not be of Opinion to Re-purchase these Annuities, then there would be no need to mention them in any future State of the Publick Debts; but the Nation, in that case, must rest contented until the <IT>Expiration</IT> of the <IT>long Term</IT> of Years for which these Annuities (now called the long Annuities) were grant&rehy;ed.</Q> A <IT>melancholly Prospect</IT> for a Nation groaning under the Pressure of these Debts! <PB
N="7">But the Facts are fairly stated; and the Re&rehy;marker only further mentions as his Thought, <Q>"That if Interest is reduced to 4. <IT>per Cent.</IT> by Act of Parliament before these <IT>Annuities</IT> are Re-purchased, or an <IT>Agreement</IT> made by the Publick for <IT>Re-Purchasing</IT> them; in such Case, the <IT>Value</IT> of the <IT>Annuities</IT> will be <IT>in&rehy;creased</IT> the further Sum of Three Millions and an Half more than they then were, and that the same would be worth about Seven Millions and an Half more than the Money <IT>originally advanced</IT>; which would raise the value of <IT>these Funds</IT> to the Sum of <IT>Twenty Millions and an Half</it></q>. This must be what the <IT>Guardian</IT> of our <IT>Property</IT> in his <IT>Crisis</IT> terms Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT> his <IT>Opinion</IT>; and thereupon he affirms, <Q>"That if the Majority of the Ho&rehy;nourable House should be of the same Opi&rehy;nion, and act accordingly, we may bid Fare&rehy;wel to the <IT>Wealth</IT>, and <IT>Honour</IT> of <IT>Great Britain</it></q>.</P>
<P><SC>To</SC> this, I answer, that if a few Weeks more should demonstrate, that contrary to our Author's Expectation, the Parliament are of Opinion with Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT>, and also are con&rehy;vinced, that this Matter can be effectually Remedied without <IT>Breach</IT> of Publick Faith, or <IT>Iniquity</IT> in the Legislature (as certainly it may) in such Case, I say, I shall be inclina&rehy;ble to mistrust, that Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> has not well Reasoned, nor rightly Computed either with relation to these Schemes, or the Majority of Votes; and if thro' the forward Zeal, and <PB
N="8"><IT>now generous Proposal</IT> of the <IT>South-Sea Com&rehy;pany</IT>, we should be so happy as to obtain by the <IT>Aid</IT> of <IT>Parliamentary Equity</IT>, the Redemption of the Nation from this, and other <IT>heavy Burthens</IT> of Publick Debt, such a Conjuncture might justly be stiled the <IT>Crisis of Property</IT> (the Prospect whereof to our Comfort, appears not very remote) from such Proceedings, I shall conclude quite con&rehy;trary to our Author, and from this <IT>&AElig;RA</IT> shall date a prodigious Encrease of our Trade, our Wealth, and our Strength; and in consequence it must follow, that <IT>Great Britain</IT> will appear in Credit, in Honour and Renown beyond all past Ages. And this <IT>Aggregate Fund</IT> of the <IT>South-Sea</IT>, will at length prove in earnest the <IT>Spunge</IT> of the <IT>State</IT>; it will <IT>suck up</IT>, and <IT>wipe out</IT>, and pay off, all the rest of our <IT>old Scores</IT>!</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> to proceed, Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> in his 7th Page is surpriz'd that Mr. <IT>H&horfill;</IT> does seem to suppose, that the <IT>Borrower</IT> is <IT>Master</IT> of the <IT>Lender</IT>; and yet they who have been ac&rehy;customed to lend Monies, or have observed the Course of Business in <IT>Chancery</IT>, must have perceived, that the Borrower frequentl&rehy;y sets the Lender at <IT>Defiance</IT>, and will neither <IT>repay</IT>, nor <IT>perform Convenants</IT> until compell'd by the slow Methods of <IT>Equity</IT>; but in the Case before us, the difficulty probably will lie on the contrary side: The <IT>Lender</IT>, so much extoll'd for the good <IT>Friend</IT> of the Government, is in danger of <PB
N="9">appearing the wayward Party; what will Sir <IT>R&horfill; </IT> be able to say on his behalf, if this <IT>forward</IT> and <IT>adventurous Subject</IT> for the <IT>Good</IT> of the <IT>State</IT> (as he calls him) shall be found so <IT>resty</IT>, and obstinate, as neither to lead nor drive, and when left to his free Will and Pleasure to take his Choice, whether he will promote the publick Good, and his own In&rehy;terest, by accepting a Sum of Money for his <IT>Annuity</IT>, which shall bring him in a better Income; or an exchance of his Annuity for another sort of Annuity, which shall bring him in Yearly a larger Sum, and be also rea&rehy;dily Saleable for a greater Sum than his An&rehy;nuity at the highest would have sold for; yet shall this <IT>applauded, good, and generous Subject</IT> refuse to do either; but being per&rehy;swaded that he is in the Right, and encou&rehy;rag'd in it, shall sullenly <IT>Hug</IT> his <IT>Property</IT>, though to the Prejudice both of <IT>himself</IT> and the <IT>Publick</IT>!</P>
<P><SC>Our</SC> Author is a Man of a quick, pene&rehy;trating, and active Thought, therefore I shall avoid to swell this Discourse to a length, which is needless, and which my Affairs do not permit, but only to add some Hints which seem not to occur to Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT>, and leave him to reflect thereon at his Leisure.</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> with his Permission, I shall first for a while address my Discourse directly to the <IT>Annuitants</IT>, and tell <IT>you, Gentlemen</IT>, that they who would have <IT>Equity</IT>, must do <IT>Equitably</IT>; I am not delivering a <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Subp&oelig;na</FOREIGN></IT> to bring your <PB N="10">Cause into <IT>Chancery</IT>; but as I presume <IT>you</IT> are convinced, that the Determinations of that Court are <IT>Equitable</IT>, I would try your Pre&rehy;tensions on this Touch-stone of good Consci&rehy;ence, that you your selves, if you can be im&rehy;partial, may perceive the too near Resem&rehy;blance.</P>
<P><SC>I shall</SC> say nothing of the <IT>Bristol Bar&rehy;gain</IT>, because in that Practice, the Principal was receiv'd in Parcels, together with Inte&rehy;rest: But <IT>you, Gentlemen</IT>, after all the exor&rehy;bitant Gain of some of you hitherto by the 9. <IT>per Cent.</IT> and 14. <IT>per Cent</IT> &amp;c. are intended and desired to <IT>receive Back</IT> your Principal, not only intire, but with as <IT>vast</IT> encrease thereof, as those who speak for you pretend now to insist on, (if they are steady to any Thing, and do not rise more and more in their <IT>Demands</IT> as <IT>Concessions</IT> are made;) there&rehy;fore, I say, your <IT>Bargain</IT> is yet worse, (that is,) more Extortionous, much more destru&rehy;ctive to the <IT>Publick</IT>, the <IT>Borrower</IT>, than the <IT>Bristol Bargain</IT>, or than what the <IT>French</IT> call <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">Le fond perdu</FOREIGN></IT>, which Method was once at&rehy;tempted here, but our <IT>English</IT> Parliament did declare their dislike by <IT>rejecting</IT> that <IT>Offer</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>I own</SC> you are not to be dealt with as <IT>Mortgagees</IT>, yet your Case differs not so much in <IT>Point of Conscience</IT> from some of theirs, as your Advocate would represent; for he that Lends on a Mortgage, runs the Hazard of the <IT>Title</IT>, and of <IT>Incumbrances</IT>, &amp;c. as much or more than you; and since you are <IT>Lenders</IT>, <PB
N="11">consider a little, I pray you, the Proceedings of the <IT>Court of Chancery</IT>, and what <IT>Relief</IT> is given against Contracts and Convenants that relate to Interest on Mortgages, and to Re&rehy;demption.</P>
<P><SC>A Person</SC> lends Money at 5. <IT>per Cent.</IT> when six was not against Law, and might easily be had; the Borrower had also a <IT>Flaw</IT> in his <IT>Title</IT>, (but I shall wave that Matter.) The <IT>Borrower</IT> agrees to pay Interest Half&rehy;yearly, and Covenants, that if no part of the Interest of two Half-years together should be paid at the end of the Year, or within one Month after at the furthest, that then, and from thenceforth, such Year's Interest (where&rehy;of no part had been paid) should be deemed Principal, and from thenceforth should carry Interest: The Interest amounted to 400<IT>l.</IT> Half-yearly, yet no part of the Interest was paid within the first 13. Months; <IT>a second</IT> 13. <IT>Months</IT> incurr'd, yet not one Penny paid of the Interest: The Lender being now dissatis&rehy;fy'd, apply'd to <IT>Equity; a third Year</IT> in&rehy;curr'd, during the <IT>Proceedings</IT>, and when the <IT>seventh Half-year</IT> was past, and not one Penny of the Interest paid, this Matter receiv'd a Determination, <IT>viz.</IT> that the <IT>Lender</IT> should be repaid his Principal, with three Years and a Half's Interest at 5. <IT>per Cent. without any Addition</IT> thereto.</P>
<P><SC>Should</SC> I suppose my self in this Case to have been the <IT>Lender</IT>, yet I would not complain; if I should use Invectives, the <PB
N="12"><IT>Great Man</IT> who gave this Determination, is, I believe, as well able to <IT>justify</IT> his Opinion now, as he was then to support his <IT>Autho&rehy;rity</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>One</SC> other Case you may permit me to tell you; the Borrower had contracted to pay 5. <IT>per Cent.</IT> Interest, but covenanted, that if at any time two Half-year's Interest together should be behind, and no part thereof paid within one Month after the end of the Year, that then, and in such Case, the Borrower would allow and pay after the Rate of 6. <IT>per Cent</IT> Interest for such Year, (6. <IT>per Cent.</IT> be&rehy;ing then legal In&rehy;terest.) One Year and a Half passed, and no Interest was paid, nor could the Borrower be prevailed with to repay the principal Money with barely 5. <IT>per Cent.</IT> Interest; hereupon <IT>Equity</IT> was apply'd to, but after much Time and Money spent on this Matter, the Lender was allowed no more than barely his Principal with 5. <IT>per Cent.</IT> though his Matter was <IT>complicated</IT> with a Circumstance, which some eminent Practicers did agree, render'd it <IT>a hard Judgement</IT>. The Lender, in this last Case, was only an Assignee; the first Lender had the same Covenant for 6. <IT>per Cent.</IT> and the Interest in his time being ran far behind when the Mortgage was as&rehy;signed, (which was done with the consent, and at the earnest Request of the Borrower,) this <IT>first Lender</IT> was actually paid after the Rate of 6. <IT>per Cent.</IT> (according to the Con&rehy;tract and Covenants) for two Years, which <PB
N="13">were then behind, and due to him; yet (af&rehy;ter a further two Years and an Half's for&rehy;bearance, and much longer before this Mat&rehy;ter receiv'd a Determination) the <IT>Assignee</IT> was allowed only 5. <IT>per Cent.</IT> Interest; had this happen'd to me, it would certainly have in&rehy;clined me to have placed for the future my little Cash entirely in the Funds; but it hath been my Fate to know also, that <IT>bad Titles</IT> are to be met with by Mortgagees; for these Reasons I gladly accept the same Interest <IT>on the Funds</IT>, as before on a Mortgage, and now I have <IT>Quiet</IT>, and can fully depend on re&rehy;ceiving the Interest <IT>duly</IT>; however, your Ad&rehy;vocate will have it, that YOU <IT>Annuitants</IT> have extraordinary Merits, and are not in the Condition of other Subjects; I shall there&rehy;fore, without Exaggerating, tell you what I know of this Matter.</P>
<P><SC>It</SC> was once my good Luck to get <IT>Admit&rehy;tance</IT> at the <IT>Exchequer</IT> by <IT>Proxy</IT>, to subscribe for an <IT>Annuity</IT>, upon which Subscription, in little more than a Fortnight, I gained, at least, 800<IT>l.</IT> above Principal and Interest by the <IT>Sale</IT> thereof at the Price then Current, and which Price was daily <IT>advancing</IT>; this was done during the Winter; there was no <IT>Battle fought</IT>, nor any <IT>Treaty of Peace</IT> on Foot; and yet your Advocate doth assert such Gain to be <IT>Meritorious</IT>; but as most of you at this time may be only <IT>Assignees</IT> of the first <IT>Annui&rehy;tants</IT>, and know little of the true Circum&rehy;stances of these Transactions; I beseech you <PB
N="14">not to be too far misled by the insinuating and plausible Arguments, and the florid Dis&rehy;courses of your Advocate, but permit me, without offence, to represent your Case in a <IT>truer Light</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>The</SC> Views, and bewitching Prospect of <IT>excessive Gain</IT>, were such, when <IT>some An&rehy;nuities</IT> were subscrib'd for, that they well deserve to be remembred on this Occasion; sometimes Books were laid open, wherein the Subscriptions were immediately fill'd up, before sufficient Authority was given for laying open such Books; and when the <IT>Parliament</IT>, and the <IT>Exchequer</IT> had given the Authority and necessary Directions for doing it, (if the ill Consequences of these Sub&rehy;scriptions did not avert one's Mind from making sport with the Matter,) I should be apt to say, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Spectatum admissi risum teneatis</FOREIGN></IT>? How many <IT>Wealthy Citizens</IT> with their Agents? How many <IT>decrepid Usurers</IT> were crowding by break of Day to get in for&rehy;most on the first Opening? How many <IT>sat up all Night</IT> with their Bills and Notes in hand, or <IT>Luggage of Bags</IT>, brib'd the <IT>Door-keeper</IT> for Admission? And by this Means, some of these <IT>brave Warriors</IT> of the forlorn Hope, had opportunity of doing themselves the Honour within this <IT>Field of Battle</IT>, to lie all Night upon <IT>their Arms</IT>! These, and such like, as I have heard, were the true Circumstances attending some of these Subscriptions; and as for those <PB
N="15">whom your Advocate calls <IT>good Citizens and Patriots</IT>; they and their Agents (a few excepted) cannot justly be supposed to have acted thus only out of their abundant Affection for the <IT>Good</IT> and <IT>Safety</IT> of the <IT>State</IT>; it may, I think, with much more Justice be suspected, that many of them deserved rather the Name of <IT>Parricides</IT>, seeking to gorge themselves with the <IT>En&rehy;trails</IT> of their Country, at that time re&rehy;quiring their more compassionate Assistance; the Oppression and Artifice at such times as these cruelly practised, might justly be&rehy;fore now have deserved a <IT>Redress</IT> from <IT>Pub&rehy;lick Equity</IT>, if the Publick were inclinable to exercise the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Summum jus</FOREIGN></IT>, which your Ad&rehy;vocate pretends to fear. How excusable this would be in the present Parliament, if there were any Necessity for it, and they were disposed to act thus, will plainer appear, if you permit me the Liberty to assert, that sometimes there was in Fact somewhat of <IT>Ex&rehy;tortion</IT>, and want of <IT>Equity</IT> in many of those who lent their Money, and wrested these <IT>An&rehy;nuities</IT> from the hands of those who would have <IT>managed better</IT> for the Publick, if they had been at Liberty to have acted for the best; but too many among the <IT>Law-makers</IT>, and others then in Power, imposed these <IT>Bargains</IT> on the <IT>Publick</IT>, and were upon the Matter too near a-kin, being many of them both the <IT>Lender</IT> and the <IT>Borrower</IT>; that my Assertion herein, may not be represented to <PB
N="16">be groundless or partial, it is necessary to pro&rehy;ceed a little farther in stating what I know relating to this Matter, to the Honour of a <IT>Worthy</IT> and indefatigable <IT>Servant of the State</IT>, in Matters of this Nature; I stept sometimes out of the Court of <IT>Chancery</IT> to discourse with this Gentleman, proud of the Liberty he gave me in being admitted to do so; after I had twice urged him with Arguments <IT>against granting Annuities</IT>, he seem'd to be displeased, as if I reproach'd him and others who influ&rehy;enced these Things as Persons <IT>managing ill</IT> for the Publick; whether Mr <IT>L&horfill;ds</IT> can recollect this Discourse, I know not, but I very well remember, that at length it was an&rehy;swer'd me with some Resentment; <Q>"I don't want for Arguments to convince me that these <IT>Annuities</IT> are not the best Method of <IT>Raising the Supply</IT>; but what can we do? They will not be quiet without them!"</Q> And by the Tendency of this Discourse, I con&rehy;ceiv'd, (as I do not doubt but that it was true in Fact) too many of the Parliament, the Officers of the <IT>Exchequer</IT>, and the great Corporations in <IT>London</IT>, were the chief Subscri&rehy;bers to these <IT>Annuities</IT>; and in short, either I mistook him, or this Gentleman's Words did imply, that, at this time, it was chiefly the Members of Parliament themselves that were bent upon Raising the Money this way.</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> let us come yet closer in this Matter; for though I have not any <IT>Annuity in Posses&rehy;sion</IT>, I must own, Gentlemen, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">nos inter nos</FOREIGN></IT>, <PB N="17">that I have some <IT>Reversions</IT>; and do think that this were better to be discoursed among our selves, than to be thus exposed and pub&rehy;lish'd Abroad.</P>
<P><SC>The</SC> Members of this present Parliament will not easily be perswaded, that when your <IT>long Annuities</IT> were subscribed for, and pur&rehy;chased at very low Rates, the Government really was at that time in such <IT>imminent Dan&rehy;ger</IT> as is pretented; or that there was any <IT>sudden Hazard</IT>, and probable Loss foreseen: In <IT>Times of Danger</IT>, the Thoughts of Men are apt to be most quick and cautious; and who that had realy seen such Dangers <IT>at Hand</IT>, would have made this Choice; (the Purchasers might then have had almost what they would;) and certainly upon imminent Danger, or visible Hazard, an exorbitant In&rehy;terest <IT>for a short Term</IT> had been much better and safer; and it will scarcely be believed, that where a Man can see that the <IT>Title is dangerous</IT>, he would, notwithstanding, make Choice of a <IT>Lease</IT> for so long a Term as <IT>Ninety-nine Years</IT>, and guard himself also against the <IT>Right of Redemp&rehy;tion</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>If</SC> you, Gentlemen, are <IT>true Friends</IT> of the Government, and <IT>Lovers</IT> of your Country, you have <IT>now</IT> an opportunity of shewing it, and of serving your selves also, by <IT>assisting chearfully</IT> to set open the Gates of Redemption.</P>
<P><SC>The</SC> <IT>South-Sea</IT> Company's <IT>Proposal</IT> has <IT>raised</IT> your <IT>Annuities</IT> three or four Years pur<PB
N="18">chase; if <IT>you</IT> like not to deal with them, it is probable, however, that so many <IT>Others</IT> will be <IT>desirous</IT>, as shall serve during this Transaction, to keep up the Price of your <IT>Annuities</IT>; if you as a <IT>scatter'd Body</IT> do su&rehy;spect hard Usage from a powerful Corporati&rehy;on, your Access to the <IT>House of Commons</IT> is as easy as theirs; but if you endeavour to urge Things <IT>too far</IT>, I wish you to look back to the Case I have cited, where the <IT>Borrower himself</IT> allowed to the <IT>first Mortgagee</IT>, what the <IT>Court of Equity denied</IT> to his <IT>Assignee</IT>; yet I mistrust not the <IT>Favour</IT> of a <IT>British</IT> Par&rehy;liament towards you, while you seek not to oppose that <IT>great</IT> and <IT>good Work</IT> which they have encourag'd.</P>
<P><SC>In</SC> setting a value on your <IT>Annuities</IT>, you'll consider that your 10<IT>l. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Annum</FOREIGN></IT> will be in your own Hands <IT>a fixed Sum</IT>, and <IT>dead Weight</IT> on the Government; but if subscribed into the <IT>South-Sea</IT>, or purchased by them, it will <IT>after Midsummer</IT> 1727, begin to move off briskly, and will then be to them, and to the Government but 8<IT>l. <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Annum</FOREIGN></IT>; you'll consider also, that the Stock of the said Com&rehy;pany, may, and doth <IT>advance</IT> much <IT>faster</IT>, and higher in the Price, than your <IT>Annuities</IT>; and that their <IT>Dividend</IT> may be also greatly <IT>enlarged</IT>; but Yours as an Annuity with you will remain the same; these Things should chiefly incline you to set a higher or lower Value on the one, and the other, ac&rehy;cording as your own Reason, or better Ad<PB
N="19">vice shall direct you; but for you to apply to <IT>Parliament</IT> to <IT>fix a Price</IT>, (as some have discoursed, you do intend to do,) that you may <IT>be certain of Admission</IT> into the <IT>South&rehy;Sea Stock</IT> at that <IT>Price</IT>, this will be difficult to adjust, because of the greater <IT>Variation</IT> in the Price of <IT>their Stock</IT>; and if this were now fixed, the <IT>South-Sea Corporation</IT> would not be willing to be long <IT>tied down</IT> to such <IT>fixed Prices</IT>; nor can it be expected of them, while you remain still at Liberty to <IT>sell</IT>, or not, and to <IT>subscribe</IT> into them, or not, <IT>at your Pleasure</IT>! But this is not my Business; you among your selves will find out the Ways and Means for setling all Things to <IT>mutual Satisfaction</IT>; but what is part of my Business while I am Writing this, is to dis&rehy;swade from such Thoughts and Attempts as may prove the Ruin of many of your selves, and Families; I would apply this, not only to the <IT>Annuitants</IT>, but to all such <IT>other Per&rehy;sons</IT> as may be inclined, or drawn in to en&rehy;deavour to <IT>run down</IT> the Price of <IT>South-Sea Stock</IT>; or under a Notion of setting a cer&rehy;tain Price, or Value on this Stock, such a Price as is not in the least probable, (accor&rehy;ding to common Methods, and the Course of other Things,) it should exceed; and depend&rehy;ing on such like Notions, are eager to <IT>sell</IT> this Stock <IT>at time</IT> for higher Prices, esteem&rehy;ing the Gain this way, as good as certain; or by taking large <IT>Premiums</IT>, or earnest Mo&rehy;ney, to deliver this Stock at three Months, <PB
N="20">six Months, or twelve Months after, at a fixed high Price; as suppose it be 150, 200, 250, &amp;c. <IT>per Cent.</IT> Some also venture to sell this Stock when they have none; or do sell ten Times more than they have, or are able to make good upon a sudden Rise; such Notions and Practices, I say, may be the Ruin of many Families, and it is chiefly to <IT>caution</IT> against, and to use my endeavour to <IT>prevent</IT> this approaching and <IT>spreading Evil</IT> that I have taken Pen in Hand, and re&rehy;solved to publish these Sheets, great Mis&rehy;chief hath often befallen those who have used <IT>these Ways</IT> in other Stocks, but certain&rehy;ly it will be found more dangerous and <IT>fatal</IT> in this Stock of the <IT>South-Sea</IT> Company. The <IT>shallow Waters</IT> are more proper for the <IT>Fry</IT>, and <IT>smaller sized Fish</IT>; Men of great Estates may <IT>bear with</IT> Losses this way, as well as by other ways of <IT>Gaming</IT>; but for a <IT>light Purse</IT> there is not any <IT>Game</IT> more <IT>Fatal</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>The</SC> <IT>Enlarging</IT> the <IT>South-Sea Capital</IT>, and the Consequences thereof, as to the <IT>Ministry</IT> and the <IT>State</IT>, is a Production worthy of the <IT>Genius of Great Britain</IT>; but as to <IT>Men of mean Estate</IT>, it is, <IT><FOREIGN

<P><SC>But</SC> I am to ask Pardon of Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT>, and expect it from his 10th Page, where he pro&rehy;mises to have <IT>Patience</IT>; and to deserve this at his Hands, I shall proceed to give him those <IT>Hints</IT> I promised, <IT>viz.</IT> That in many Cases, <IT>Equity</IT> is exerted, where Persons out of <IT>Wilfulness</IT> do prevent their own <IT>Benefit</IT>, as well as the <IT>Publick Good</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>There</SC> are Men that will not suffer their <IT>boggy Land</IT> to be <IT>drained</IT>; others, such Lo&rehy;vers of <IT>Liberty</IT> and the <IT>Commonwealth</IT>, that they will not suffer Wasts, Heaths, or com&rehy;monable Grounds to be inclosed, though they might thereby become <IT>Owners</IT> of a Propor&rehy;tion in <IT>severalty</IT>; but in such Cases <IT>Equity Over-rules</IT>; in time of <IT>Danger by Fire</IT>, Houses are <IT>pull'd down</IT>, or blown up, for the <IT>Pub&rehy;lick Good</IT>, though against the Will of the Owners; also to <IT>preserve</IT> the <IT>Town</IT>, the <IT>Suburbs</IT> are frequently burnt or demolish'd; even the <IT>Town</IT> is destroy'd to preserve the <IT>Citadel</IT>. A Person in Danger of immerging through the Weight, or Force of another, may even <IT>destroy</IT> the other to <IT>preserve himself</IT>; and a <IT>Thousand</IT> such like Instances might be given.</P>
<P><SC>As</SC> to our Author's 14th Page towards the latter part, and in the beginning of the 21st Page, I am willing to suppose some <IT>Error of <PB
N="22">the Press</IT>; especially where it is said, that the Borrower ought not to intermeddle with what <IT>is Lent</IT>, but by the Command or Ap&rehy;plication of the Lender; this, I suppose, should have been <IT>the Security for what is Lent</IT>, which the <IT>Borrower</IT> is not to meddle with; (because <IT>this</IT> moves from the Borrower, and <IT>passeth</IT> to the Lender) for if it were meerly the <IT>Thing lent</IT>, (as suppose it to be <IT>Money lent</IT>, which the Borrower is not to in&rehy;termeddle with,) in such Case, if our Author will be so <IT>Equitable</IT> towards me, as to per&rehy;mit me for a while to intermeddle with, and <IT>borrow</IT> some of his Expressions, and to use, and apply them only for the present, as I think proper, in such Case, I would say, that this seems something like what he calls a <IT>Chimera</IT>, or <IT>Crudity</IT>; for at this Rate, his <IT>Lend&rehy;er</IT> would really be an <IT>Oppressor</IT>, and his <IT>Borrower</IT> a <IT>Bubble</IT>; and thus these Terms might be Synonimous, if not convertible; and our Author would have <IT>proved</IT> what he is not willing to own, (<IT>viz.</IT>) that his Lender not only <IT>had</IT>, but <IT>still hath</IT> too much <IT>Command</IT> over the Borrower.</P>
<P><SC>After</SC> the like manner, his Treatise <DEL

<P><SC>But</SC> I must neither advance too far into Sir <IT>R&horfill;'s</IT> Province, nor quite forget our Au&rehy;thor, &horfill; it is he that will dictate in the Se&rehy;nate; if he does this after the manner he has promis'd us in his 28th Page, were it not better that he would forbear it?

<P><SC>We</SC> have not, God be thanked, at this time, any <IT>urgent Motives</IT> that should prevail with us to buy <IT>Foreign Gold</IT> too dear; and to let other Nations into that <IT>great Gain</IT> they propose to make by the <IT>Rise</IT> of the <IT>South-Sea Stock</IT>, upon the <IT>Enlargement</IT> of their Capital; for which they are watching, and as it is said, are already preparing to catch the Op&rehy;portunity so soon as a <IT>Bill</IT> in Parliament shall be <IT>ready to pass</IT>; or, perhaps, <IT>only brought into the House</IT> for this purpose; if, therefore, at once, and as it were in an Instant, (before it can be known Abroad, and Commissi&rehy;ons sent hither,) the Stock of the <IT>prevailing Company</IT> should be advanced to near that <IT>Price</IT> which it ought to have, and may <IT>rea&rehy;sonably bear</IT>, the Annuitants hereby would <PB

LANG="FRA">Quincam&rehy;pois</FOREIGN></IT> will be <IT>avoided</IT>, and the Publick, may obstruct, and very much prevent that Gain, which other Kingdoms, and States propose to make (<IT>to our Loss</IT>) on this Occasion; the <IT>French Nation</IT> are now too <IT>late</IT> strugling with many <IT>Difficulties</IT> for want of timely Manage&rehy;ment, with regard hereunto; yet this, it is likely, has not arisen so much from any Over-sight, or Defect in the Schemes of that enterprizing Genius, who hath the <IT>chief Di&rehy;rection</IT>, or of others with whom he must <IT>Con&rehy;cert</IT>; but thro' an over-ruling Self-Interest, on account of the <IT>vast Gain</IT> to be <IT>privately made</IT> by the many Turns and <IT>Vibrations</IT> his <IT>Projects</IT> would admit of; which it should not be supposed that he did not foresee, or failed to concert his Measures accordingly; a Profit, and <IT>Gain</IT> capable of being so <IT>Im&rehy;mense</IT>, that, whatever the <IT>French Nation</IT> in general may <IT>suffer</IT> thereby, if the <IT>private Gain</IT> hath really been such, and so great as it may reasonably be imagined, the Effects thereof may <IT>too soon</IT> be such, as may prevent it's remaining <IT>long a Secret</IT> to the rest of <IT>Eu&rehy;rope</IT>; but my Pen hath already <IT>let fall</IT> too much <IT>Ink</IT> on this Subject; and, I fear, that what I have here only <IT>touched</IT>, may rather be taken for a <IT>Blot</IT>, than accepted as it is in&rehy;tended by me.</P>
<P><SC>This</SC>, however, may be <IT>repeated</IT>, that it would be greatly to our <IT>Advantage</IT>, by some <PB
N="26"><IT>timely</IT>, and proper <IT>Means</IT> to prevent <IT>other Countries</IT> from <IT>sharing</IT> too much, and car&rehy;rying away the Profit of that <IT>Advance</IT> of our <IT>Publick Securities</IT>, which seems to be at Hand; and the due <IT>Precaution</IT> herein, is more absolutely necessary, because our <IT>happy Constitution</IT> does not admit a Reliance on such Artifices, and <IT>After-Games</IT>, as in <IT>France</IT> are easy to be <IT>concerted</IT>, and may as <IT>suddenly</IT> be put in <IT>Practice</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>In</SC> stating, and <IT>arguing</IT> the Case of the <IT>Annuitants</IT>, there appears so <IT>little</IT> Occasion for introducing the <IT>Silesia Loan</IT>, and so much <IT>less</IT> for mentioning the <IT>Equivalent</IT> allowed to <IT>Scotland</IT>, and also the <IT>English Grants</IT>; that some take Umbrage, and fancy there was not any <IT>good</IT> Reason for <IT>picking out</IT> these Instances.</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> if the Question is to turn upon the <IT>Equity</IT>, and <IT>Power</IT> of <IT>Parliaments</IT>, it will be <IT>answer'd</IT> by only stating the Question <IT>right&rehy;ly</IT>; the <IT>Nation</IT> by a long and expensive War, is highly <IT>incumbred</IT>, and grievously <IT>Oppres&rehy;sed</IT> with many heavy <IT>Debts</IT>; the greatest, the most encreasing, the longest continuing, and the most <IT>obnoxious Debt</IT> is <IT>the Annuities</IT>; in short, the way thro' these <IT>Annuities</IT> is the on&rehy;ly Right, and ready Road thro' which the <IT>Government</IT> must <IT>pass</IT> to ease the Nati&rehy;on of the Burthen of <IT>all the rest</IT> of these Debts; Now, whether you will have the <IT>Government</IT> to Travel by <IT>Land</IT>, or by <IT>Wa&rehy;ter</IT>, it will be the same; if the <IT>Highway</IT> is <PB
N="27">such as is <IT>dangerous to Travellers</IT>, and can&rehy;not otherwise be <IT>amended</IT>, there must be an <IT>Act of Parliament</IT>; and (giving Satisfaction to the <IT>Owners</IT>,) whatever is needful in such Cases must be done; Gates, Bars, Hedges, and all Obstructions may be removed; and new Gates, new Bars, and Turnpikes erect&rehy;ed; and none may pass to buy, or sell, for the future, but by this <IT>new Road</IT>, and ac&rehy;cording to <IT>new Directions</IT>; also <IT>Penalties, Levies</IT>, and <IT>Tolls</IT> may be appointed for maintaining this <IT>new Highway</IT>; and, in like manner, for the <IT>Publick Benefit, Rivers</IT> are made <IT>Navigable</IT>; any Man's Lands are cut through, though <IT>against the Will</IT> of the <IT>Owner</IT>; and Goats, Sluices, Hatches, and Flood-Gates are erected; and must be <IT>main&rehy;tained</IT> by the Owners of such Lands.</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> let us suppose that <IT>many</IT> should take <IT>Offence</IT>, and in <IT>Opposition</IT> to these necessary, profitable, and publick Works, would <IT>act</IT> as <IT>Rioters</IT>, or <IT>Lunaticks</IT>; and that such a <IT>Number</IT> of Persons should act thus, that <IT>no other</IT> Pow&rehy;er but <IT>Parliament</IT> would undertake to <IT>meddle</IT> with them; would their <IT>Number</IT>, or the fear of their <IT>Resentment</IT>, awe the <IT>Senate</IT>, and prevent them from being used like other <IT>Lu&rehy;naticks</IT>, who would mischief either them&rehy;selves, or others? But, here, as to the An&rehy;nuitants, it is said, the <IT>Senate</IT> hath promis'd not to <IT>interpose</IT>, or use their <IT>Authority</IT>; and hath Enacted, that the <IT>Annuitants</IT> shall not be in the same Condition as <IT>other Subjects</IT>, <PB
N="28">but during Ninety-nine Years shall be <IT>exempt</IT> from any <IT>new Direction</IT>; in this Case, if there were any <IT>Court of Equity</IT> above the Power of Parliament, there would naturally lie an <IT>Appeal</IT> to such <IT>higher</IT> Power; but there being <IT>none</IT> such, is the reason why the Parliament wherein this was Enacted, is lia&rehy;ble to be controul'd, and <IT>over-ruled</IT> by the Power of a <IT>future Parliament</IT>; for in the Nature, and <IT>Constitution</IT> of the <IT>British Legi&rehy;slature</IT>, there is a <IT>tacit</IT> and <IT>indefezible Equity reserved</IT>, by Virtue whereof (as the Occasion of private, or publick Good shall require it) Acts of Parliament are, and will be explain&rehy;ed, or amended; continued, or suffered to expire; repealed, revived, revoked, or an&rehy;nulled: As I may appeal from the Judgment of Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> the <IT>last Month</IT>, to the Judgment of Sir <IT>R&horfill; better adviced</IT> this Month!</P>
<P><SC>But</SC> in his 12th and 13th Pages, our Au&rehy;thor mentions the Insurance of Ships as a pa&rehy;rallel Case to this of the <IT>Annuitants</IT>; and defies any Man <IT>breathing</IT> to shew a juster Comparison; hereon he throws down his <IT>Gauntlet</IT>; and who shall dare to take it up? Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> is not a Man of Straw; No! no! His Legs, his Arms, and his Sides are of Iron; his Countenance is terrible in Battle; though he can demolish a <IT>stong Fortress</IT> with a <IT>Goose Quill</IT>, yet the Staff of his Spear is like a <IT>Weaver's Beam</IT>; the Head thereof is of <IT>polish'd Steel</IT>, well pointed, and the Weight six Hundred Shekels.</P>
<PB N="29"><P><SC>In</SC> this Matter I shall only have Recourse to A. B. C. and least this <IT>Goliah</IT> of the <IT>Phi&rehy;listines</IT> should be offended, and think this to be only flinging of <IT>Stones</IT> at him, I refer it to the <IT>Gentlemen</IT> of the <IT>Inner-Temple</IT>, whe&rehy;ther these are not <IT>lawful Weapons</IT> in put&rehy;ting of Cases; others have much more <IT>Art</IT> in the Use of them; but I went for some Years to School in their <IT>Society</IT>, and very often to the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">Grande Sale d'Armes</FOREIGN></IT> in the Parish of St <IT>Margaret's</IT>, near the Collegiate-Church of St. <IT>Peter's</IT> of <IT>Westminster</IT>, where I learned from those <IT>expert Masters</IT>, the Lord <IT>S&horfill;</IT>, Sir <IT>N&horfill; W&horfill;</IT>, the Lord <IT>C&horfill;</IT>, the Lord <IT>H&horfill;</IT>, and Earl <IT>C&horfill;</IT>, all right well skilled in the <IT>High</IT> and <IT>Honourable Science</IT>.
</P><P><SC>To</SC> state this Case of <IT>Insurance</IT> plainly, we must suppose, that Sir <IT>R&horfill;'s Ship</IT> or <IT>Vessel</IT> was a very large <IT>first Rate</IT>; A <IT>HUGE</IT> one indeed! Almost as big as any Island in <IT>Europe</IT>; not quite so big as <IT>Great Britain</IT>, but about the size of the Kingdom of <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>. A. is the <IT>Master</IT>, or <IT>Captain</IT> of this Ship, B. represents the <IT>Lieutenant</IT>, the <IT>Chaplain</IT>, the <IT>Purser</IT>, the <IT>Cockson</IT>, the <IT>Master-Gunner</IT>, the <IT>Boatswain</IT>, the <IT>Cock</IT>, the <IT>Mates</IT>, and all the <IT>Midshipmen</IT>; C. represents the common <IT>Sai&rehy;lors</IT>, the <IT>Swabbers</IT>, the rest of the <IT>Ship's Crew</IT>, and all the <IT>Passengers</IT>; a prodigious Number! This huge Ship has not only all these Men on Board her, but also has a Cargo equal to the Goods and Effects of all <PB
N="30">the People of <IT>England</IT>. A. was himself on Board, and had large Effects of his own. B. was on Board with all his Effects, and the like of C; We are also to note, that C. represents almost all those who were them&rehy;selves to be insured. Now, is it reasonable to suppose, that B. and C. would agree to give a very high Premium for Insuring this Ves&rehy;sel to any who had themselves a large share in the Cargo, and were themselves on Board, and to go the same Voyage, unless there was something <IT>Extraordinary</IT> in the Matter? Which some, I say, did think, was this, that B. and C. who were to fix and settle the <IT>Rate of the Insurance</IT>, were sometimes willing the same should be very much to the Advan&rehy;tage of the Insurers; and having themselves the Liberty of writing first, they at those times <IT>subscribed</IT> very <IT>liberally</IT>, and after&rehy;wards parcelled out to the generality, on worser Terms, the greatest Part of their Subscriptions; more Words need not be be&rehy;stowed on this Matter; 'tis plain enough how unlike it is to the <IT>common</IT> Case of <IT>In&rehy;surance</IT>.</P>
<P><SC>I confess</SC>, that as to <IT>Publick Credit</IT> and <IT>Parliamentary Faith</IT> relating to <IT>Property</IT>, (if it were really in Question,) it would be very dangerous to make any Alteration without Consent of Parties; but is not <IT>Consent</IT> im&rehy;plied in whatever is <IT>Enacted</IT>? And if the <IT>Terms</IT> were to be <IT>abated</IT>, or any way <IT>altered</IT>, <PB
N="31">must not this be done by the Wisdom of the Nation on a <IT>Rehearing</IT> upon the <IT>Equity reser&rehy;ved</IT>? And shall it be gain-sayed, that it is for the <IT>Publick Good</IT>, or that it hath the <IT>Con&rehy;sent</IT> of Parties? I shall always acknowledge <IT>That</IT> to be <IT>Lawful</IT> and <IT>Right</IT>, which Parlia&rehy;ment shall do; for, I well hope, that they ne&rehy;ver will do any Thing but <IT>because</IT> it is Law&rehy;ful and Right! But Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT>, who hath a Right to <IT>Debate</IT> this within Doors, hath more <IT>Jealousies</IT> than others, and in six Pages more hath lost his <IT>Temper</IT>, and forgets that the Question will turn upon this, whether what is now doing, is <IT>Evil, or Not</IT>. If the <IT>Parlia&rehy;ment</IT> should do it, it is an <IT>Estoppel</IT> to me to say that it is <IT>Evil</IT>; I submit my <IT>Notions</IT> to what is done by the <IT>Legislature</IT>, and believe it will be for the <IT>Publick Good</IT>, and do assert <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Salus Populi suprema Lex</FOREIGN></IT>! But <IT>Appealing</IT> from the <IT>Senate</IT> to the <IT>People</IT>, is <IT>pre-judging</IT> the Cause, and censuring the <IT>Proceedings</IT>; why then hath Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> Recourse from the <IT>Wisdom</IT> of the <IT>Senate</IT>, to the Passions and Ignorance of the <IT>People</IT>, unless he could sup&rehy;port by just and unanswerable Arguments, that, <IT><FOREIGN

If the Matter should require a Decision in the <IT>Senate</IT>, (which there appears not yet any sufficient Occasion for;) why must we admit, that the <IT>Annuitants</IT> either were, or will be <IT>Over&rehy;power'd</IT>? If there were much Danger when they Lent, the less Power the then Parlia&rehy;ment had over them, for in Times of <IT>Pub<PB

<P><SC>I should</SC> have as little Temper as any Man, if it did appear, that any <IT>Wrong</IT> would be done to the <IT>Annuitants</IT>!

N="33">buy again much cheaper of the <IT>York Build&rehy;ing's</IT> Company; and with them, the <IT>An&rehy;nuities</IT> will be secured on the <IT>Lands</IT> they have, and shall Purchase. I grant also, that some few of the <IT>long Annuities</IT> were sub&rehy;scribed at times of <IT>Danger</IT>, and that such of these as remain still in the Hand of the <IT>Subscribers</IT>, or have never been Sold, do deserve a particular Regard: But still, I say, that our Author's Arguments, when strip'd of pompous <IT>Words</IT>, are bare Asser&rehy;tions, and are mostly so ill-grounded, as can neither convince me, nor any other, (who in earnest does with the National Debt fair&rehy;ly, and <IT>soon</IT> discharg'd,) that the <IT>Annuitants</IT> in general do merit his Encomiums, though he <IT>pleads</IT> for them with the Firmness of <IT>Mutius</IT>; if they were really such <IT>Lovers of</IT>, and <IT>Champions for</IT> their Country, where among them are the <IT>Decii</IT>? Who is now the <IT>Curtius</IT>? If it be true, that our consum&rehy;mate <IT>General</IT> hath left them; I mean, the <IT>British Hero always Victorious</IT>; but Sir <IT>R&horfill;</IT> meets with such <IT>noble Examples</IT> in <IT>Roman</IT> History, that by his 28th Page it is plain, that 'tis a very hard Matter for any Man, <IT>while in the Ministry</IT>, to please him. When I once complained as he does, I was told, that even <IT>Churchmen</IT>, were Men; <IT>Statesmen</IT>, were only Men emminent in the State; <IT>Parliament Men</IT>, but Men in the Parliament; and that the <IT>best of Men</IT>, were but <IT>Men at best</IT>!</P>
<PB N="34"><P><SC>Having</SC> received much Delight, and Sa&rehy;tisfaction from several of Sir <IT>R&horfill;'s</IT> Perfor&rehy;mances, I will say nothing to the <IT>Virulency</IT>, and <IT>Invectives</IT> in the close of his Pamphlet, only this, that I wish they were not to be found in it; when I read them, I was <IT>sur&rehy;priz'd</IT> to find a Person so versed in <IT>Schola&rehy;stick Authors</IT>, practice so contrary to the No&rehy;tions we imbibe from them in our Youth.

</P><P><SC>This</SC> manner of swelling Pamphlets with <IT>Invectives</IT>, and <IT>Complaints</IT>, brings to my Re&rehy;membrance what I heard from the late <IT>Speaker</IT> Sir <IT>T. Littleton</IT>; he happen'd to have in his Coach some <IT>Ladies</IT>, whereof One at every <IT>Shock</IT> of the Perch, or <IT>unequitable Motion</IT> of a Wheel, was ready to <IT>scream</IT>, and <IT>squeal aloud</IT>; Sir <IT>Tho&rehy;mas</IT> grew very uneasy, lest the Lady should fright her self into <IT>Fits</IT>, but her Neice said, <Q>"Don't be <IT>concern'd</IT> Sir <IT>Thomas</IT>, my Aunt is not more <IT>afraid</IT> than others; she <IT>commonly does thus</IT>; she hath an <IT>agreeable Voice</IT>, and thinks this <IT>squeal&rehy;ing</IT> becomes her!"</Q></P>
<P><SC>When</SC> some of these <IT>Annuities</IT> were granted, (if the Facts were as herein before&rehy;mentioned,) I should be apt to think, (though I will never say it,) that, the Terms of, and in such <IT>Annuities</IT>, were voted, not <IT><FOREIGN

<P><SC>But</SC> while the Realms are <IT>Bless'd</IT> with such a <IT>King</IT>, and we have such a <IT>Ministry</IT>, I shall not mistrust, that <IT>this Nation</IT> will either <IT>do</IT>, or <IT>suffer</IT> any publick Wrong.</P>
