<SALUTE><SC>Sir</SC>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic; Have considered the <IT>Discourses</IT> sent me, published lately about <IT>Indulgence</IT> and <IT>Toleration</IT>. At their first view, I confess I was not a little surprized with their <IT>Number</IT>, as not understanding the reason of their <IT>Multiplica&rehy;tion</IT> at this time, nor what it was that had made them <IT>swarm</IT> so unseasonably. Upon their per&rehy;usal, I quickly perceived a de&rehy;fect in them all, which could no other ways be supplied; whether it be so by this means or no, Impartial Men will judge. The De&rehy;sign seems to have been; That what is wanting in them singly in <IT>Reason</IT>, may joyntly be made up in <IT>Noise</IT>; and their respective defects in <IT>Argument</IT>, be supplied by their communion in <IT>Suf&rehy;frage</IT>. It will doubtless be the wisdom of those who are concer&rehy;ned in what they oppose, to stand out of their way, at least un&rehy;til the storm is over.

</L></Q></P><P>Their Reason will be better attended to, when this earnestness hath a little spent it self. For Men who have attained more than perhaps they ever aimed at, at least than they had just reason to <PB
N="4">expect, have commonly for a while strong desires to secure their possessions, which Time and a due consideration of their Title and Interest, may somewhat calm and allay. In the mean time, because <IT>You expect it</IT>, I shall give you a brief account of my thoughts concerning the Matter treated of by them; and if that do not too long detain me, of the reasonings also which they make use of. Some things I do much commend their <IT>Ingenuity</IT> in; For whereas two things were proposed to them, A Compli&rehy;ance with some by way of <IT>Condescention</IT>, and a Forbearance of others by way of <IT>Moderation</IT>, they equally declare against them both. They will neither <IT>admit</IT> others to them, but upon their own terms to the utmost <IT>Punctilio</IT>; nor bear with any in their <IT>dissent</IT> from them in the least different Observances; but all must be alike pursued by <IT>Law</IT> and <IT>Force</IT>, to their Ruine. Whether this seem not to be the frame of mens spirits, whose <IT>Fortune and Power</IT> (as one of them speaks) <IT>tempts them to an insolency</IT>, so&rehy;ber and dis-interested persons will judge. The minds I confess of <IT>fortunate Men</IT> are for the most part equal unto their Successes; and what <IT>befalls</IT> them, they count their <IT>due</IT>. Nothing else could perswade these men that they alone were to be esteemed <GO>English&rehy;Men</GO>, and that not onely as unto all Priviledges and Advantages attending that Title; but so far also, as to desire that all who differ from them, should be <IT>exterminated</IT> from their Native Soyl. It were well if we could see more of their endeavours to <IT>merit</IT> so high a favour, more of that usefulness, and advantage which they bring to the Kingdom, that might countenance them in pleading that they <IT>alone ought to be in it</IT>. For my part, I can see little consistency with Christianity, Humanity, or Prudence, in these Resolutions. For certainly if that be <IT>Christian Religion</IT> which we are taught in the Gospel, it inclines men, especially those who are <IT>Teachers of it</IT>, (such as the Authors of these Discourses, at least most of them, seem to be) unto a greater <IT>Condescention</IT> than that expressed, upon the Causes, and for the Ends of its being desired. The request of some for a <IT>Condescention</IT>, seems to be no more, but that the Rulers of the Church would forbear the pre&rehy;scription and imposition of such things on the <IT>Consciences</IT> and <IT>Practise</IT> of men, (for it is vain to pretend that Conscience is not concerned in practise in the worship of God) as there is not one word about, nor any thing inclining, leading, or directing <IT>to<PB
N="5">wards</IT>, in the <IT>whole Bible</IT>, that were never thought of, menti&rehy;oned or commanded by Jesus Christ, or his Apostles, or any <IT>A&rehy;postolical</IT> Men; that if they had not unhappily fallen upon the minds of some Men to invent, none knows <IT>who</IT>, nor <IT>where</IT>, nor <IT>when</IT>, would have had no concernment in Christian Religion.
</P><P>They indeed who impose them, say they are <IT>things indifferent</IT>. But the <IT>differences</IT> that have been almost this hundred years about these <IT>things indifferent</IT>, is enough to frighten and discourage un&rehy;biass'd men from having any thing to do with them. And what wise man, methinks would not at length be contended, that these <IT>differences</IT> and <IT>indifferent things</IT> may be parted withal together? Besides, they on whom they are imposed, account them not so: They look upon them as <IT>unlawful for them to use</IT> and practise (all circumstances considered) at least most of them do so. And they plead by the important Argument of their Sufferings, that it is meerly on the <IT>account of Conscience</IT> that they do not conform unto them. Others think that it is not so; but I am sure it is possible that it may be so; and if it be so, they cannot use them without endangering the Eternal Ruine of their own Souls; though others may speed otherwise in their observances, who have other thoughts and apprehensions of their Nature and Use. And yet on the other side, if those that <IT>impose</IT> these things, can make it appear with any probability, (I had almost said if they would but pretend) that they were <IT>obliged in Conscience to im&rehy;pose them</IT>, by my consent there should be an end of this strife. But whilst there is this Left-handed Contest, <IT>Real Will</IT> and <IT>Pre&rehy;tended Prudence</IT>, fighting against <IT>Conscience</IT> and <IT>Duty</IT>, it is like to be untoward and troublesome. And for what end is it that some desire that there might be at least some relaxation as to the present <IT>severe Impositions</IT> of some of the things which are thus contended about? They say it is meerly that they might serve God in the Gospel to the <IT>good of others</IT>, without sinning against him, to the ruine of themselves. They speak particularly unto Men who profess it to be their <IT>Calling</IT>, their Work, their Design to promote the blessed ends of the Gospel towards the Souls of Men: They desire of them that they may have leave to come and <IT>help them</IT> in reference unto this end. Nor can it be pretended, That they themselves are sufficient for the Work, and that they have no need of the <IT>Assistance</IT> of others: God and Man know that this cannot be reasonably pleaded.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>And this is a business, which certainly by such men as profess themselves to be Guides and Rulers of the Church, can hardly be justified unto him who is the great Lord of it. When the Disciples found some casting out of <IT>Devils in his name</IT>, they re&rehy;buked them because they <IT>followed not with them</IT>; a worse and greater <IT>non-conformity</IT> than that which some are now charged withal; and yet the rebuke of others, procured only <IT>one</IT> to themselves. He said well of old, concerning those who con&rehy;tended to promote common good; <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">agath&emacr; d&apos;eris h&emacr;de brotoisi</FOREIGN> <IT>This is a good strife for mortal men</IT>: So is that which is for pro&rehy;moting of the good of the souls of men by the preaching of the Gospel; and shall it be forbid for such things, <LB>&horfill; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Qu&aelig; dicere Nolo</FOREIGN>, <LB>of so little importance are they in this matter, which hath an influence into Eternity. What is answered unto this <IT>request</IT>? Stories are told of things past and gone; <IT>scattered</IT> interests, <IT>dissolved</IT> intrigues, buried miscarriages, such as never can have any <IT>aspect</IT> on the present posture of Affairs, and minds of men in this Nation, are gathered together, and <IT>raked</IT> out of their graves, to compose <IT>Mormoes</IT> for the affrightment of men from a regard to the ways of peace and <IT>moderation</IT>: This they enlarge upon with much <IT>Rhetorick</IT>, and some <IT>little Sophistry</IT>; Like him of old, of whom it was said, that being charged with other things,
<Q REND="it" LANG="lat"><L>&horfill; Crimina rasis
</L><L>Librat in antithetis; doctas posuisse figuras
</L><L>Laudatur &horfill;
</L></Q></P><P>Many inconveniencies are pretended, as like to ensue upon such a condescention: but in the mean time <IT>men die</IT>, and some it may be <IT>perish</IT> for want of that help and instruction in the things of Eternity, which there are many ready to give them, whilst it is altogether uncertain, whether any one of the pretended in&rehy;conveniencies will ensue or no: I fear whilst men are so enga&rehy;ged in their thoughts about what is good and convenient for them at the <IT>present</IT>, they do scarce sufficiently ponder, what ac&rehy;count of their actions they must make <IT>hereafter</IT>.</P>
<P>But neither is this all that these Authors contend for: Men <PB N="7">are not only denied by them an <IT>admission into their Societies</IT> to preach the Gospel, unless it be on such terms as they cannot in conscience admit of, and which others are no way obliged in con&rehy;science to <CORR
SIC="imposs">impose</CORR> upon them; but all <IT>forbearance</IT> of, or <IT>indul&rehy;gence</IT> unto them who cannot <IT>conform</IT> unto the <IT>present establish&rehy;ment</IT>, is decried, and pleaded against: What though men are <IT>peaceable</IT>, and <IT>useful</IT> in the Common-wealth? What though they are every way <IT>sound in the Faith</IT>, and cordialy imbrace all the doctrine taught formerly in the <IT>Church of England</IT>? What though those in this condition are <IT>many</IT>, and such as in whose peace and industry, the welfare of the Nation is exceedingly con&rehy;cerned? What if they offer to be <IT>instructed</IT> by any who will take that work upon them, in the things about which their dif&rehy;ferences are? What if they plead <IT>conscience</IT> towards God, and that alone, in their dissent; it being evidently against their whole <IT>temporal interest</IT>? What if they have given evidence of their readiness in the ways of Christ and the Gospel, to oppose <IT>every errour</IT> that is either <IT>pernicious</IT> to the souls of men, or any way of an evil aspect to <IT>publique peace</IT> and tranquility? All is one, they are neither severally, nor joyntly, no one of them, nor all of them, in the judgment of these <IT>Gentlemen</IT>, to be forborn, or to have any Indulgence exercised toward them; but Laws are to be made and put in execution against them to their ruine; ex&rehy;tirpation and <CORR
SIC="destrustion">destruction</CORR>. It may be it will be said, that these things are <IT>unduly imposed</IT> on them, seeing they press for a prose&rehy;cution of men by Laws and rigour, not for <IT>dissenting</IT> from what is established, or not practising what is prescribed in the <IT>publick Worship</IT> of God, but for practising what is of their <IT>own choice</IT> therein, in Meetings and Assemblies of their own; otherwise they may <IT>keep their consciences unto themselves</IT> without molesta&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>But it doth not appear, that this can be justly pleaded in their defence: For as the Prohibition of men under severe and di&rehy;structive penalties, from that exercise of the worship of God, which is suitable to their light, and which they are convinced that he requires of them, so that in nothing it <IT>interfere</IT> with the <IT>fundamentals</IT> of Christian Religion, or publick tranquility, is as destitute of all Foundation in Scripture and Reason at <IT>all <PB
N="8">times</IT>, and as things may be circumstantiated in Prudence or Policy; as the inforcing of them to a <IT>practical</IT> compli&rehy;ance with any <IT>mode</IT> or way of Worship against their Light and conscience; so the practice in this <IT>latter case</IT> hath been more <IT>severe</IT> amongst us, than in the <IT>former</IT>. For a Testimony hereof, we have those great Multitudes which at this day are <IT>Excommunicated</IT> by the <IT>Courts Ecclesiastical</IT>, meerly for their not attending the publique Assemblies of the Nation in their Administrations: And as they are by this means, as things now stand, cast, as they say, into the condition of men <IT>out-Lawed</IT> and deprived of all priviledges of their birth-right as <IT>English-men</IT> (of which sort there are forty times more, than have been pro&rehy;ceeded against unto the same issue in all his Majesties Courts of Justice in <IT>England</IT> for many years) so in the pursuite of that sentence, many are <IT>cast into prisons</IT>, where they lye perishing (sundry being dead in that state already) whilst their <IT>families</IT> are starved or reduced to the utmost extremity of poverty, for want of those supplies which their industry formerly furnished them with all: And what influence this will have into the state of this Nation; time will manifest, if men are not as yet at leasure to consider. The <IT>hands</IT> that by this means are taken off from labour, the <IT>stocks</IT> from imployment, the <IT>minds</IT> from contrivances of industry in their own concerns, the poverty that is brought on Families, in all which the common good hath no small Interest, are not I fear sufficiently considered by persons whose fullness and plenty either diverts their thoughts from taking notice of them, or keeps off any impressions on their minds and judgments from what is represented concerning them. Others begin to feel the evil, whose <IT>morning</IT> they saw not, gathering up towards them, in the <IT>decay</IT> of their Revenues, and intanglements of their Estates, which without timely remedy, will increase upon them, untill the <IT>breach</IT> grow too great for an ordinary healing.</P>
<P>And I am perswaded that none who have been active in these proceedings, will take upon themselves the trouble of con&rehy;firming this kind of <IT>Church Discipline</IT> out of the Scriptures, or Examples of the Primitive Churches, for some hundreds of years.</P>
<P>This therefore, is that which by these men is pleaded for; namely that all the <IT>Protestants in England</IT> who <IT>so</IT> dissent from the established Forms and Modes of Worship, as either to <IT>ab<PB
N="9">sent</IT> themselves from their Observances, or to attend unto any other way of Worship, which being suitable to the Principles of that Religion which they profess, (namely <IT>Protestantism</IT>) they are perswaded is according to the Mind of God, and which He requires of Them, be proceeded against, not onely with <IT>Ec&rehy;clesiastical Censures</IT>, but also with <IT>Outward, Pecuniary</IT>, and <IT>Corporal Punishments</IT>, to the depriving of Them in the progress, of Their whole Liberty, Freedom, and Benefit of the Laws of the Land, and in some Cases unto Death it self; and that no <IT>Dispensation</IT> or <IT>Relaxation</IT> of this severity, be countenanced or granted. And herein I confess, whatever Pretences be used, whatever Fears and Jealousies of Events upon a contrary Course, or the granting of an <IT>Indulgence</IT> be pleaded, I am not of their Minds; nor do I think that any countenance can be given to this <IT>severe Principle</IT> and Opinion, either from the Scriptures of the Old or New Testament, or from the Example of any who ever endeavoured a Conformity unto the Rules of them. This is the state of the Controversie, as by these Authors formed and hand&rehy;led; nor may any thing else be pretended, when such Multitudes are ready to give Evidence unto it, by what they have suffered and undergone. Do but open the Prisons for the relief of those Peaceable, Honest, Industrious, Diligent Men, who some of them have lain <IT>several</IT> Years in <IT>Durance</IT>, meerly in the pursuit of <IT>Ex&rehy;communication</IT>, and there will be Testimony enough given to this state of the Controversie.</P>
<P>This being so, pray give me leave to present you with my <IT>hasty Thoughts</IT>, both as to the Reasonableness, Conscience, and Prin&rehy;ciples of pursuing that Course of Severity towards Dissenters, which I find so many <IT>Concerned Persons</IT> to plead for: And also of the <IT>way</IT> of their Arguings and Pleas.</P>
<P>And first as unto <IT>Reason</IT> and <IT>Conscience</IT>, I think Men had need look well unto the Grounds of their Actings, in things wherein they proceed against the <IT>Common Consent</IT> of Mankind, expressed in all instances of the like occasion, that have occurred in the World; which is as great an Evidence of the Light and Law of Nature, as any can be obtained. For what all Men generally consent in, is from the common Nature of all. We are not in&rehy;deed much concerned to inquire after the <IT>practise of the Heathen</IT> in this matter, because as the Apostle testifies, their Idolatrous <PB
N="10"><IT><CORR SIC="Confnsion">Confusion</CORR> in Religion</IT> was directly and manifestly against the Light of Nature; and where the foundation was laid in a transgression of that Law, it is no wonder if the proceeding <CORR
SIC="npon">upon</CORR> it be so also. There was a Law amongst the <IT>Romans</IT>, reported by the Orator to be one of those of the <IT>Twelve Tables</IT>, forbidding any to have <IT>private Gods</IT> of their own: But this regarded the <IT>Gods themselves</IT>, the Object of their Worship, and not <IT>the Way of <CORR
SIC="Worsbipping">Worshipping</CORR> them</IT>, which was peculiar and separate to many Families and Tribes amongst them, and so observed. Scarce any Family or Tribe of note, that had not its special and separate <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sacra</FOREIGN>. Besides, they seemed to have little need of any <IT>new Authorized Gods</IT>, seeing as <IT>Varro</IT> observed, they had of them they owned, no less than thir&rehy;ty thousand. And I have often thought that Law was imposed on them by the craft and projection of <IT>Satan</IT>, to keep them off from the knowledge of the true God: For notwithstanding this Law, they admitted into their <IT>Superstition</IT> all sorts of Idols even the folly of <IT>Egyptians</IT> themselves, as having Temples in <IT>Rome</IT> unto <IT>Isis</IT> and <IT>Serapis</IT> Onely this Law was pleaded to keep off the knowledge of the true God, <IT>Act.</IT> 18.13. And of him they had the highest contempt, calling the place of his Worship, the Land <LB>&horfill; <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Dei incerti</FOREIGN></IT>. &horfill; <LB>And the Custome among the <IT>Athenians</IT> not to admit any strange <IT>Objects of Worship</IT>, any Unwarranted Devotion, was never made use of, but to oppose the <IT>Gospel</IT>, unless it were when they destroyed the <IT>Wisest and Best Man that ever the City bred</IT>, for giving some intimation of the true God, and not consenting with the <IT>City</IT> in Opinion about their <IT>Established De&rehy;votions</IT>: Other <IT>use</IT> of these Laws there was none. It is true, when any <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Sacra</FOREIGN></IT> or <IT>Superstitious Observances</IT> were actually used to induce Men and Women to Sin and Wickedness, contrary to the Light of Nature, the very Being of Civil Societies, the <IT>Ro&rehy;mans</IT> severely animadverted upon them: Otherwise this Law was not made use of, <CORR
SIC="bnt">but</CORR> onely against the <IT>Jews</IT> first, and the <IT>Chri&rehy;stians</IT> afterwards; whereby it was consecrated to the use of Ido&rehy;latry, and rendred unmeet for the Churches Service or Recep&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>The <IT>Jews</IT> were those who were first intrusted with the Truth <PB
N="11">of Religion and the Worship of God. And it is known what was their <IT>Law</IT>, their <IT>Custom</IT>, their <IT>Practice</IT> in this <IT>Matter</IT>. Whoever would dwell amongst them, if they owned their <IT>Fun&rehy;damentals</IT>, they afforded them the Blessing and Peace of the Land. All that they required of such Persons, was but the Observation of the <IT>Seven Noachical Precepts</IT>, containing the Principles of the Light of Nature, as to the <IT>Worship of one God</IT>, and Moral Honesty amongst Men; whoever would live amongst them of the <IT>Gentiles</IT>, and took upon themselves the observation of these <IT>Fundamentals</IT>, although they subjected themselves to no <IT>instituted Ordinances</IT>, they called <IT>Proselytes of the Gate</IT>, and gave them all Liberty and Peace. And in those who submitted unto the Law of <IT>Moses</IT>, who knows not what different Sects and Opinions, and <IT>Modes of Worship</IT> there were amongst them, which they never once supposed that they had any Rule to proceed against by external Force and Coercion.</P>
<P>The Case is yet more evidently expressed in the Judgement and Actings of the first Christians. It will be utterly superfluous to shew how that for three hundred years, there was not any a&rehy;mongst them who entertained thoughts of <IT>Outward Force</IT> a&rehy;gainst those who differed from the <IT>Most</IT>, in the things of Chri&rehy;stian Religion. It hath been done I perceive of late by others. And yet in that space of time, with that Principle, the Power of Religion subdued the World, and brake the force of that <IT>Law</IT> whereby the <IT>Romans</IT> through the Instigation of Satan, endea&rehy;voured with Force and Cruelty to suppress it. When the <IT>Em&rehy;pire</IT> became <IT>Christian</IT>, the same Principle bare sway. For though there were mutual Violences offered by those who dif&rehy;fered in great and weighty Fundamental Truths, as the <IT>Homou&rehy;sians</IT> and <IT>Arians</IT>; As to those who agreeing in the important Doctrines of <IT>the Gospel</IT>, took upon <IT>themselves</IT> a peculiar and se&rehy;parate way of <IT>Worship and Discipline</IT> of their own, whereby they were <IT>exempt</IT> from the common Course and Discipline of the <IT>Church, then in use</IT>, never any <IT>thoughts</IT> entered into men, to give unto <IT>them</IT> the least disturbance. The Kingdom of <IT>&AElig;gypt</IT> alone had <IT>at the same time</IT> above <IT>forty thousand Persons</IT>, Men and Women, living in <IT>their private and separate Way of Worship</IT>, without the least controul from the Governours of Church or State; yea, with their Approbation and incouragement.</P>
<PB N="12"><P>So was it all the World over, not to mention the many different Observances that were in and amongst <IT>the Churches themselves</IT>, which occasioned not <IT>Division</IT>, much less <IT>Persecution</IT> of one a&rehy;nother. And so prevalent is this Principle, that notwithstand&rehy;ing all their Design for a forcing unto an <IT>Uniformity</IT>, as their peculiar Interest, yet it hath taken place in the Church of <IT>Rome</IT> it self, and doth so to this day. It is known to all, that there is no Nation wherein that Religion is inthroned, but that there are thousands in it that are allowed their particular ways of Worship, and are exempt from the common ordinary Jurisdiction of the Church.
</P><P>It seems therefore, that we are some of the first who ever any where in the World, from the Foundation of it, thought of ru&rehy;ining and destroying Persons of the <IT>SAME RELIGION</IT> with our selves, meerly upon the choice of some <IT>Peculiar Ways of <CORR
SIC="Worsbip">Worship</CORR></IT> in that Religion. And it's but reasonable, as was ob&rehy;served, for men to look well to the grounds of what they do, when they act contrary to the Principles of the Law of Nature, exprest in so many Instances by the consent of Mankind. And I fear all men do not aright consider, what a secret Influence into the Ener&rehy;vating of <IT>Political Societies</IT> such Intrenchments on the Principles of Natural Light, will assuredly have. For those things which spring up in the Minds of Men without Arguing or Consideration from without, will insensibly prevail in them against all Law and Constitution to the Contrary. It is in vain to turn Nature out of doors, it will return. And whence shall we learn what Nature inclines unto, unless from the common practise of Mankind in all Instances, where an evident demonstration may not be given, of the prevalent influence of the interest of some Men unto the contrary? Which is, <LB>&horfill; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Pessimus Diuturnitatis custos</FOREIGN>.</P>
<P>It will not always prevail, nor ever any time without great <CORR
SIC="regreet">regret</CORR> and commotion in the minds of Men, who have no con&rehy;cern in that Interest.</P>
<P>Consider also the thing it self, of <GO>Forcing the Consciences of Men</GO>, in manner before expressed; and you will find it so <IT>un&rehy;couth</IT>; as I am perswaded you will not know well what to make <PB
N="13">of it. <IT>Learned Divines</IT> tell us, <GO>That Conscience is the Judge&rehy;ment that a man maketh of Himself and his Actions, with refe&rehy;rence to the future Judgement of God</GO>; or to that purpose. Now let others do what they will, Conscience will still make this Judg&rehy;ment, nor can it do otherwise. Whatever Men can alter in the Outward Actings of Mens Lives, they can alter Nothing in the Inward Constitution of the Nature given it by God in its Crea&rehy;tion, which refers to its Future End. How can this be forced?</P>
<P>It is said therefore, <IT>Let Men take this liberty unto themselves: Who forbids them to judge of Themselves and of their Actions, what they please? None goes about to take this Liberty from them</IT>.</P>
<P>But is this all? <IT>Conscience</IT> doth not judge of Men and their Actions, but with respect unto what in the Name of God it re&rehy;quires them to <IT>be</IT>, and to <IT>do</IT>. It first requires several things of them in the Name of God, and then <IT>judges</IT> upon their performance, with reference unto the Judgement of God: And this is the soveraign Dictate of it, <GO>Worship God according to that Light and Understanding which you have, of what is that Wor&rehy;ship which is acceptable with Him, in matter and manner, and no otherwise</GO>. If this Command be not obeyed, <IT>Conscience</IT> will <IT>judge</IT> with reference unto the Judgement to come. Let <IT>Consci&rehy;ence</IT> then have its Liberty for this Work, and this Difference is at an end.</P>
<P>But it will be said, If Conscience must be free as to it <IT>first Act</IT> of Directing and Commanding, as well as unto its Self-Judging, it may lead men to all Abominations, Wickedness, Murthers, Sedition and Filthiness; and so a Liberty unto them also must be granted. So I have heard men speak, but I have wondered also that any man that hath a <IT>Conscience of his own</IT>, or knows what Conscience is, should give entertainment to so fond an Imma&rehy;gination: I would ask any man whether ever he found any such direction in his own Conscience, or any Inclination that way? Nay, if he have not constantly found a severe Interdiction given in by his Conscience against all such things? And how can he then conceive it possible that the Conscience of any man should be of such a Make, and Constitution; seeing naturally it is abso&rehy;lutely the same in all. Besides, as was said, It is a mans judgment of himself in reference to the future Judgment of God. And <PB
N="14">this Intimation supposeth, that a man may judge that God at the Last day will approve of <IT>Adultery</IT>, Murders, Seditions and the like Evils! Which is to suppose all common inbred Notions of God to be blotted out of the mind: Nay it is utterly impos&rehy;sible, as implying a <IT>contradiction</IT>, that any man should consider <IT>God as a Judge</IT>, as Conscience doth always, and suppose his Ap&rehy;probation of the Evils specified, or of any of the like nature and importance: But men will yet say that Conscience hath been pretended for these things. I answer, <IT>never</IT> by any in their witts. And what any brain-sick, or <IT>Enthusiastick</IT> Person may say or doe in his <IT>Paroxisms</IT>, is not to have any place in considerations of what becomes a guidance of the Actions of Man-kind one to&rehy;wards another. It is true; that some things as they have been Circumstantiated, have been debated, even in Conscience, whe&rehy;ther they have been Lawful or no; that is whether God would approve of them, or condemn them at the last day. But what is evil in its self, and against the light of Nature, there is no directi&rehy;on unto it, no approbation of it from Conscience in the least. To take away this <IT>Liberty of Conscience</IT> in things of its proper <CORR
SIC="Cog&rehy;uizance">Cog&rehy;nizance</CORR> and Duty, seems to me, to be as much as to say, men shall not judge themselves with referrence to the Judgment of God to come; which is to put Gods great Vicegerent out of his place and Throne.</P>
<P>Let us now apply this notion of Conscience unto the present occasion. There is prescribed a way of Divine Worship, with Ceremonies, Forms of Prayer, and Orders for the Administrati&rehy;on of Sacraments, all things that concern the Joynt and Pub&rehy;lique Worship of God. What is the Work or Duty of Consci&rehy;ence in reference hereunto? Is it not, in the first place, to ap&rehy;ply the Mind and Understanding to consider of what sort it is, in referrence unto the future Judgment of God? This cannot be denied; the first Actings of a man who makes any Conscience of what he does, must be of this sort. If then it apprehend it to be such as God will approve of the Practice, and Observation of it at the last Day, Conscience is satisfied, and reflects no <IT>self-Condem&rehy;ning</IT> thoughts upon its Observance. But suppose a man doth not understand it so to be; he cannot conceive it to be appointed so by Christ, nor that any men have Warrant, Authority, or Commission to impose on the practice of others what is not so <PB
N="15">appointed by him. How shall he do to be otherwise minded? Can he <IT>force</IT> himself to <IT>assent</IT> unto that, whereunto in truth he doth not assent? Is it in his power so to do: Ask any man who hath an <IT>Understanding</IT>, whether he can apply it to what he will; that is to <IT>assent</IT>, or not <IT>assent</IT> unto what is proposed unto him: All men will assuredly say, that their <IT>assent</IT> necessarily followeth the <IT>evidence</IT> that they have of the truth of any thing, and that otherwise it is not to be obtained. The Mind despiseth all vio&rehy;lence, or coaction from the Will: Yea, it implys <IT>a Contradicti&rehy;on</IT> that a man should cause himself to <IT>assent</IT> unto that unto which he doth not assent. Can then other men compell this assent? It is so far otherwise that God himself will not; yea, be it <CORR
SIC="spok n">spoken</CORR> with reverence of his Holiness, cannot force such an assent, see&rehy;ing it implies a Contradiction; Namely, that a man should <IT>assent</IT> and <IT>not assent</IT> to the same Proposition at the same time: Neither can a man himself force himself, neither can all the men in the World force him, to understand more than he doth understand, or can do so. Men do not seem to have exercised many reflect Acts of Consideration on themselves, who suppose that any can command their Understandings to apprehend what they please, or to assent unto things at their will. These things follow Con&rehy;viction and Evidence; and so God himself procures the <IT>Assent of Men</IT> unto what he revealeth; and otherwise the Understand&rehy;ing is absolutly free from all imposition.</P>
<P>If a man then cannot understand these things to be approved of God, and accepted with him; suppose they are so, yet if a man cannot apprehend them so to be, what is the next work that <IT>Conscience</IT> will apply it self unto? Is it not to declare in the Soul, that if it practise these things, God will judge it the Last Day, and pronounce Sentence against him? For Conscience, as was said, is a Mans Judgement of Himself and his Moral Actions, with respect unto the future Judgement of God. And I am per&rehy;swaded that this is the condition of Thousands, in reference to the present Impositions. Their Apprehensions and Judgements of themselves in this Matter, are to them unavoidable and insu&rehy;perable. It is not in their power to think otherwise than they do, nor to judge otherwise of themselves in reference unto <CORR
SIC="the the">the</CORR> practise of the things imposed on them, than they do. Neither can all the men in the World force them to think or judge <PB
N="16">otherwise. If ever Light, and Evidence unto their Conviction of <CORR
SIC="he">the</CORR> Contrary, is imparted to them, or do befall them, they will think and judge according to it; in the mean time, they crave that they may not be forced to act against their Light and Consciences, and so unavoidably cast themselves into destruction. All then that some desire of others, is, That they would but give them leave to endeavour to please God; seeing they know it is a fearful thing to fall into his Hands as an Avenger of Sin. God deals not thus with Men; for although He requires them to believe whatever He reveals, and proposes as an object of Faith, and to obey whatever He commands, yet he gives them <IT>sufficient evidence</IT> for the one, and Warranty of his Authority in the o&rehy;ther; and himself alone is JUDGE of what Evidence is so sufficient. But men can do neither of these: They can neither give Evidence to their Propositions, nor Warrant to their Au&rehy;thority in their Impositions in Spiritual things, and yet they ex&rehy;act more than doth God himself: But so it is, when once his Throne is invaded, his Holiness, Wisdom, and Clemency are not proposed to be imitated, but a fond abuse of Soveraignity alone, is aimed at.</P>
<P>To impose Penalties then inforcing men to a Compliance and <CORR
SIC="Actlng">Acting</CORR> in the Worship of God, contrary unto what they are <IT>Convinced in their Consciences</IT> to be his Mind and Will, is to en&rehy;deavour the inforcing of them to reject all respects unto the fu&rehy;ture Judgments of God; which as it is the highest wicked&rehy;ness in them to do, so hath not God <IT>Authorized</IT> any of the Sons of men, by any means to endeavour their Compulsion unto it. For the former of these, <IT>that men may Act in the things of God, contrary unto what they are perswaded he requires of them</IT>; I suppose none will ever attempt to perswade themselves or others. Atheisme will be the end of such an Endeavour.</P>
<P>The <IT>sole Question</IT> is, Whether God hath Authorized, and doth warrant any man, of what sort soever, to compell others to Worship and serve him, contrary to the way and manner that they are in their Consciences perswaded that he doth accept and approve. God indeed where men are in <IT>Errours</IT> and <IT>Mistakes</IT> about his Will and Worship would have them taught, and In&rehy;structed, and sendeth out his own Light and Truth to guide them, as seemeth good <CORR
SIC="nnto">unto</CORR> him.</P>
<PB N="17"><P>But to affirm that he hath Authorized men to proceed in the way before mentioned, is to say, that he hath set up an Au&rehy;thority <IT>against himself</IT>, and that which may give controule to His.
</P><P>These things being so, seeing Men are bound Indispensably not to Worship God so as they are convinced and perswaded, that he will not be Worshiped; and to Worship him as he hath Ap&rehy;pointed and Commanded, upon the Penalty of Answering their Neglect and Contempt hereof with their everlasting Condition at the last day; And seeing God hath not Warranted or Autho&rehy;rized any man to <IT>inforce</IT> them to <IT>Act contrary to their Light</IT>, and that perswasion of his Mind and Will which he hath given them in their own Consciences; nor to <IT>punish</IT> them for yeilding Obedi&rehy;ence in <IT>Spiritual things</IT> unto the Command of God as his mind is by them apprehended, if the things themselves, though mistaken, are such as no way interfere with the common Light of Nature or Reason of Man-kind, the Fundamental Articles of Christian Religion, Moral Honesty, Civil Society, and Publike Tranquili&rehy;ty: especially if in the things wherein men acting, as is supposed, according to their own Light and Conscience in difference from others, are of small Importance, and such as they probably plead are unduly and ungroundedly imposed on their Practice, or Pro&rehy;hibited unto them, it remains to be considered whether the grounds and ends proposed in Exercise of the Severity pleaded for, be agreeable to common Rules of Prudence, or the state and condition of things in this Nation.</P>
<P>The ground which men proceed upon in their resolutions for Severity, seemes to be, That the <IT>Church</IT> and <GO>Common-Wealth</GO> may stand upon the same <GO>Bottome</GO> and <GO>Foundation</GO>; that their Interest may be every way the same, of the same <IT>breadth</IT> and <IT>length</IT>, and to be mutually <IT>narrowed</IT> or <IT>widened</IT> by each other.</P>
<P>The <IT>Interest of the Kingdome</IT> they would have to stand upon the <IT>Bottome of Uniformity</IT>: So that the Government of it should, as to the beneficial ends of Government, comprehend them on&rehy;ly, whom the Church compriseth in its <IT>Uniformity</IT>; and so the Kingdoms Peace, should be extended only unto them, unto whom the Churches Peace is extended. Thus they say, that the <PB
N="18"><GO>Kingdom and the Church</GO>, or its present Order and Establish&rehy;ment, are to be like <IT>Hypocrates</IT> <GO>Twins</GO>, not only to be Born to&rehy;gether, and to Die together, but to cry and laugh together, and to be equally affected with their mutual Concerns: But these things are evident mistakes in Policy, and such as Multiplied <IT>Ex&rehy;perience</IT> have evidenced so to be. The Comparison of <IT>Monar&rehy;chie</IT> or the Fundamental Constitution of the Policy and Govern&rehy;ment of this Nation, with the present Church-Order, and State, Established on a Right, <IT>mutable</IT> and changeable Laws; And which have received many alterations, and may at any time when it seems good to the King and Parliament receive more; is expressive of a <IT>Principle</IT> of so evil an Aspect towards the <IT>solid Foundation</IT> of the Policy of this Nation, as undoubted&rehy;ly those who are principally concerned in it, are obliged not to admit an avowance of. For whereas it is not the <IT>Gospel</IT> in gene&rehy;ral, nor Christian Religion, or Religion considered as it best corresponds with the Gospel, or the mind of Christ therein, but the <GO>present Church-Order, Rule</GO> and Policy, that is intended, all men know that it is Founded in, and stands solely amongst us, on such Laws, as is usual with Parliaments to Enact in one Sessi&rehy;on; and to repeale in another, or at least to Enact in one Age, and to repeale in another, according as use and Experience ma&rehy;nifests them to be conducing, or obstructing <CORR
SIC="uuto">unto</CORR> Publick Good. And whereas the constitution of the <GO>Civil Government</GO> of the Nation, is built upon no such <GO>Alterable or <CORR
SIC="Changeabl">Changeable</CORR> Laws</GO>, but hath quite another Foundation, Obnoxious to Nothing, but to the All-over. Ruling providence of the most High, it is a great shaking and weakning unto its <IT>Fixation</IT> and Interest in the minds of Men, to have it compared with things every day alterable at pleasure. And the attempt to Plant the <GO>Kingdomes Peace</GO>, on the Foundation of the <GO>Churches Uniformity</GO>, which may on a thousand occasions wherein the Peace of the Kingdom of it self is not in the least concerned, be narrowed unto a Scantling wholy unproportionate unto such a Superstruction, is without doubt as great a mistake in Government as any persons can fall into. All the World knows, how full at this day it is of <CORR
SIC="varions">various</CORR> Opinions, and Practises in things concerning Religion; and how unsuccess&rehy;ful the Attempts of all sorts have been for their Extinguishment. <PB
N="14[19]">It is no less known, as hath in part already been discoursed, how unavoidable unto Men, considering the various <IT>Alotments</IT> of their Condition in Divine Providence, their different Appre&rehy;hensions and Perswasions about these things are. He therefore that will build the Interest of a Nation, on an Uniformity of <IT>Sen&rehy;timent</IT> and Practices in these things, had need well fix this <IT>float&rehy;ing Delos</IT>, if he intend not to have his Government continually tossed up and down.</P>
<P>The true Civil Interest of this Nation, in the <IT>Policy, Govern&rehy;ment</IT>, and <IT>Laws</IT> thereof, with the <IT>Benefits</IT> and <IT>Advantages</IT> of them, and the <IT>Obedience</IT> that is due unto them, <GO>Every English-Man is born unto</GO>; he falls into it from the Womb; it grows up with him; he is <IT>indispensably</IT> engaged into it, and holds all his temporal Concernments by it: He is able also by <IT>Natural Rea&rehy;son</IT> to understand it, so far as in point of Duty he is concerned, and is not at liberty to dissent from the Community. But as for Religion, it is the Choice of Men; and he that chuseth not his Religion, hath none: For although it is not of necessity, that a Man <IT>formally</IT> chooses a Religion, or <IT>one way in Religion</IT> in an opposition unto, and with the <IT>rejection of another</IT>; yet it is so that he so chooses in opposition to no <IT>Religion</IT>, and with Judge&rehy;ment about it, and approbation of that which he doth embrace, which hath the nature of a voluntary choice.</P>
<P>This being the Liberty, this the Duty of every Man, which is, always hath been, and probably always will be issued in great vari&rehy;ety of Perswasions, and different Apprehensions, to confine the <CORR
SIC="Peaee">Peace</CORR> and Interest of Civil Societies unto any one of them, seems scarce suitable unto that Prudence which is requisite for the stee&rehy;rage of the present state of things in the VVorld. For my part, I can see no reason the <GO>Civil State</GO> hath to expose its Peace unto all those Uncertain Events which this Principle will lead unto. And it seems very strange, and I am perswaded that on due Con&rehy;sideration it will seem strange that any should continue in desire of confining the bottom of the Nations Interest in its Rule and Peace, unto that <GO>Uniformity in Religion</GO>, which as to a firm Foundation in the <IT>Minds</IT> and <IT>Consciences</IT> of <IT>Men</IT>, hath dis&rehy;covered it self to be no more diffused amongst the Body of the People, than at present it is, and from which such Multitudes do, <PB
N="20">upon grounds to themselves unconquerable, dissent; resolving to continue so doing, whatever they suffer for it; who yet otherwise unanimously acquiesce in the <GO>Civil Government</GO>, and are willing to contribute to the utmost of their Endeavours, in their several places, unto its Peace and Prosperity.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore be the Resolution as to a present <IT>procedure</IT>, I heartily wish that the <IT>Principle</IT> it self might for the future be cast out of the Minds of Men; that the State and Rule of the Nation, might not by plausible and specious pretences, suited to the interest of some few Men; be rendred obnoxious unto im&rehy;pression from the variety of Opinions about things Religious, which as far as I see, is like to be continued in the VVorld.</P>
<P>Especially ought this consideration, if I mistake not, be appli&rehy;ed unto those Differences about which alone this Discourse is intended; namely, those which are amongst men of the same Re&rehy;ligion in all the <IT>Substantials</IT> of it, and which having been of long continuance deduced from one Age to another, are greatly diffu&rehy;sed, and deeply rooted in the Minds of Men; being such also, as no countenance can be given to act severely towards them, from any thing in the Scriptures, or practise of the first Churches in the VVorld.</P>
<P>And I hope it will never more amongst sober and dis-engaged persons be said or thought, that the Interest of <IT>England</IT>, or of its Rule and Government, is in any thing confined unto a precise determination of the Differences in the Minds and Consciences of Men, so that those who are of one Mind in them, and would impose the Apprehension and Practise of their Perswasion upon others, should be alone comprehended therein.</P>
<P>But let the <IT>Ground</IT> of this Severity in proceeding against Dis&rehy;senters be never so weak or infirm, yet if the <IT>End</IT> proposed in it be accomplished, the Counsel will appear at last to have been <IT>adviseable</IT>. What then is the end of these things, of this <IT>Severity</IT> so earnestly pressed after, to be engaged into? Suppose the best <IT>appearing Success</IT> that in this case can be supposed, and all that seems to be desired; namely that by <IT>External Force</IT> and Compulsion, Men be brought unto an <IT>Outward Conformity</IT> in, and unto the things that are imposed on them. This is the utmost of what seems to be desired or aimed at. For no man surely is so <PB
N="21">vain as to imagine that <IT>Compulsion</IT> and <IT>Penalties</IT> are a means sui&rehy;ted to perswade or convince the Minds of Men. Nay, Com&rehy;monly it is known, that they have a contrary effect, and do ex&rehy;ceedingly confirm men in their own perswasions, and into an alie&rehy;nation from the things they are compelled unto.</P>
<P>Suppose then this <IT>End</IT> to be obtained: Is there better Peace or Establishment assured to the present Church-Order thereby, than what it may enjoy whilst Men have their <IT>Liberty</IT> to profess their dissent? Both Reason and Experience do testifie the con&rehy;trary.</P>
<P>Nor will the Church find any more <IT>dangerous Opponents</IT>, upon any emergent occasion, than those who have been <IT>compelled</IT> to <IT>Uniformity</IT> against their Conviction. For bearing their <IT>Condi&rehy;tion</IT> always as their <IT>Burthen</IT>, they will not be wanting unto an opportunity to ease themselves of it.</P>
<P>And it may be sundry Persons now vested with <IT>Ecclesiastical Power</IT>, if they would recollect their former Thoughts and <IT>Ex&rehy;pressions</IT>, might remember that they both conceived and declared their mind to this purpose; that <IT>former Severities</IT> in the like kind, were unduly and <IT>disadvantagiously</IT> pursued against that strong inclination in so many unto an Indulgence, and Freedom from their Impositions, which surely they cannot think to be now <IT>lessened</IT> or weakned.</P>
<P>But present Power is apt to change the minds of Men, and make them neither remember what were their former apprehen&rehy;sions, nor foresee what <IT>would</IT> be their thoughts upon a disap&rehy;pointment in their present Undertakings.</P>
<P>But neither yet can this rationally be supposed; nor is it pro&rehy;bable in the least, that the outward Conformity intended, will ever be obtained by Rigor; especially where the reasons of it are so remote from influencing the Consciences of Men. For what&rehy;ever Arguments may be used for a Restraint to be put upon <IT>Con&rehy;science</IT>, in things concerning <IT>Faith</IT> and the Worship of God, which must be taken from the nature of the things themselves, are utterly superseded and made useless, by the nature of the Diffe&rehy;rences that are in contest between the Imposers, and those that deprecate their Impositions. For as very little hath been done, especially of late, to prove the <IT>Lawfulness</IT> of the things imposed, nothing at all to assert their <IT>Necessity</IT>; so the nature of the things <PB
N="21[22]">themselves, about which the difference is; quite casts them out of the compass and reach of those Arguments which are pleaded in the case of Coercion and Penalties in the things of Religion or the Worship of God. For if men should be able to prove that <IT>Heresies</IT> and <IT>Idolatries</IT> are to be <IT>punished</IT> in the Persons of them that do assert them: no Conclusion will or can be thence made, as I suppose, for their Punishment and Ruine, who by the Con&rehy;fession of them that would punish them, are neither <IT>Hereticks</IT> nor <IT>Idolaters</IT>.</P>
<P>Force must stand alone in this case; and what small Influence it is like to have on the practices of Men, when it hath no pre&rehy;tence of Reason nor Judgment, wherein <IT>Conscience</IT> is concerned to give its countenance, is not uneasie to determine. Nay <IT>experi&rehy;ence</IT> hath sufficiently in most places baffled this attempt: Vio&rehy;lence hath been used in matters of Religion to the shame and stain of Christianity; and yet never succeeded any where, to Ex&rehy;tinguish that perswasion and Opinion which it was designed to <CORR
SIC="extripate">extirpate</CORR>.</P>
<P>It may be; for a while indeed, and sometimes it may obtain such <IT>succese</IT>, as to seem <CORR
SIC="ro">to</CORR> have effected the end amed at. But still within a short space, mostly in the compass of the same Age, it hath been manifest, that it hath but laid in Provision for future trou&rehy;bles, Oppositions, and Animosities.</P>
<P>Let the <GO>Prelates</GO>, or <GO>Rulers</GO> therefore of the Church advise, press unto, and exercise this Severity whilst they please; They may as evidently see the Issue of it, as if it were already accomplished. Some may be ruined, Multitudes provoked, the Trade of the Nation obstructed, some few be inforced unto an <IT>Hypocritical</IT> compliance with what is against the Light of their Consciences, compassion be stirred up in the residue of the People for innocent Sufferers, and by all Indignation against themselves and their ways encreased; considering <IT>what are</IT> the things about which these differ&rehy;ences are, How <IT>deeply</IT> rooted a dissent from the present Establish&rehy;ment is in the minds of Multitudes: For <IT>how long</IT> a season that perswasion hath been delivered down unto them, even ever since the first Reformation, gradualy encreasing in its Sufferage to this day, the Advantages that it hath had for its Growth and Im<PB
N="22[23]">provement, with <IT>successes</IT> evidently suitable unto them, and re&rehy;solution that mens Spirits are raised unto, to suffer and for&rehy;go the utmost of their earthly concernments, rather than to live and die in an open Rebellion to the commanding light of God in their Consciences: It is the utmost vanity to have other Expectations of the <IT>end</IT> of such a course of Rigor and Prosecu&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I am sure whoever gets by Persecution, the <IT>King</IT> looseth by it.</P>
<P>For what if some Officers of <GO>Ecclesiastical Courts</GO> have been inriched by the <IT>booty</IT> they have got from Dissenters? What ad&rehy;vantage is it all this while to the <IT>Kingdom</IT>? when so many Families are Impoverished, so many ruined, as are by <GO>Excommuni&rehy;cations</GO> and Imprisonments ensuing thereon, so many more dis&rehy;couraged from the exercise of their Faculties, or improvment of their Stocks, so many driven beyond the Seas; and yet all this nothing, unto what in the same kind, must and will ensue, if the course sometimes begun should be pursued. To me it seems that an <IT>attempt</IT> for the pretended Conformity, (for attained it will never be) is scarce a due Compensation for his <IT>Majesties</IT> loss in the diminishing of his <GO>Subiects</GO> and their Wealth, wherewith it is and will be certainly attended: Besides! to ruine men in all their <IT>Substantials</IT> of Body and Life, for <GO>Ceremonies</GO>, and those our own Country-men and Neighbours, seems to car&rehy;ry with it somewhat of that <IT>severity</IT> which <GO>English-men</GO> after the subsiding of the impetuous Impressions of Provocations, do naturally abhor, and will not long by any means give Counte&rehy;nance unto.</P>
<P>On the Consideration of these things, and other doubtless of more deep Investigation, his Majesty hath often declared, not only his <IT>Resolution</IT> to grant the <IT>Indulgence</IT> Intimated in his Graci&rehy;ous Declaration to that purpose, but also the exceeding Suitable&rehy;ness of those Intentions unto his own Inclination and Clemency. The Advantages which have already ensued unto the Nation, in the Expectation of <GO>Indulgence</GO> have been also remembred, and repeated by him with an uncontrouleable Manifestation of its conducibleness for the future, unto the Peace and Prosperity of the <PB
N="24">Kingdom. <GO>And it seems very strange, that so Noble and Royal Dispositions, such Thoughts and Counsels of Wisdom and Au&rehy;thority, such Projections of Care and Solicitude for the King&rehy;doms Good, should be all Sacrificed to the Interest of any one Party of Men whatsoever.</GO></P>
<P>I cannot but hope, that <IT>His Majesty</IT> will re-assume those blessed <IT>Counsels of Peace</IT>: Especially considering that the Spi&rehy;rits of Men are singularly disposed to receive and put a due Valu&rehy;ation upon the Execution of them. For all those who desiring <IT>an Indulgence</IT>, though differing amongst themselves in some things, do joyntly cast their Expectations and Desires into a de&rehy;pendance on His <IT>MAJESTY</IT>, with Advice of His <IT>PARLIAMENT</IT>.</P>
<P>And as notwithstanding their <IT>Mutual Differences</IT>, they are united in this Expectation, so may they be made Partakers of it: Although in other things their Differences continue, they cannot but agree in Loyalty and <IT>Gratitude</IT>: When <IT>the Denyal of it unto them</IT>, although they still differ <IT>in other things</IT>, will reconcile their Mindes in <CORR
SIC="regreet">regret</CORR> against the <IT>Impositions they Joyntly undergo</IT>.</P>
<P>And, whereas men have by the Fears, Dangers, and Sufferings which they have passed through, evidenced to all the World, that the <GO>Liberty</GO> and <GO>Freedome</GO> of their Consciences is of more con&rehy;sideration with them, than all other things whatever; and have learned themselves also how to esteem and value that <GO>Liberty</GO>, without which they are sensible how miserable their Condition is, and is like to be, it is impossible that any stronger Obligati&rehy;on unto Peaceableness Loyalty, and Thankfulness, can be put upon the <GO>Subiects</GO> of any Nation, then a Grant of the Indulgence de&rehy;sired would put upon Multitudes in this. This would set their minds at Liberty <CORR
SIC="fom">from</CORR> Fears and Contrivances for the Avoidance of Impendent Dangers; incourage them to engage the utmost of their Endeavours and Abilities in the businesses of Peace and Se&rehy;curity, leaving them no Fears, but only of any Disturbance of the state of things, which hath secured unto them all their prin&rehy;cipal Interests in the World.</P>
<PB N="25"><P>And how foolish, senceless, and <IT>unbecoming of Men</IT>, would any other Thoughts be? To think, <IT>That Men who have given this Evidence at least, That they are such as exercise</IT> <GO>A Good Conscience</GO> <IT>towards God and Others, in that they have suffered for it, and are ready yet farther so to do, should not despise and contemn all suggestions of unpeaceable Dispositions, or should suppose that <CORR

<P>Neither is this a matter of any <IT>Expence</IT>, but only of <GO>Ge&rehy;nerous Clemency</GO> in themselves, and the deposition of Wrath, Envy, and Revenge in some few others; things that may be parted withal, without the least detriment unto humane Society.

REND="it" LANG="LAT">Res dur&aelig; & regni Novitas me talia cogunt</FOREIGN>.
</P><P>The present Assurance of publique Peace and Tranquility, ad&rehy;mitts of Counsels impartially tending to the Good of all, unin&rehy;fluenced by a mixture of Fears and Jealousies.</P>
<P>But suppose the <GO>Peace</GO> and <GO>Prosperity</GO> of the Nation to be much <GO>Secured</GO> and <GO>Advantaged</GO> by an <GO>Indulgence</GO>, as undoubtedly under the Protection and Blessing of God, it will be; yet I have heard some say, and it is commonly pleaded, That the <IT>Church will not be able to keep its Station</IT>, or to retain <CORR
SIC="it">its</CORR> Members in compliance; but they will many, if not most of them, make use of the Liberty desired; especially if it be for and unto <IT>Prote&rehy;stants</IT>, which must be prevented. Now this I confess seems strange to me, that any such <IT>events</IT> should be feared or ex&rehy;pected.</P>
<P>Those who make this Objection, Suppose the <IT>Church</IT> to be really possessed of <IT>Truth and Order</IT> in the matters that are in difference; They express every day not only the great Sence they have of the <IT>Learning</IT>, Ability and Piety of the Clergy, but are ready also on all occasions, to contemn their Adversaries, as men Unlearned, Weak, and Inconsiderate. It is also granted that all outward Priviledges, Incouragements, Advantages, Pro&rehy;motions, Preferments, Dignities, Publick Conveniencies, Legal Maintainance, are still to be confined unto the Church, and its <IT>Conformists</IT>; as also that those who desire the benefit of <GO>Indulgence</GO>, must together with an Exemption from all these, pay all <PB
N="27">Dues required by the Law to them; and if they will joyn themselves unto others, besides a Deprivation of the great conveniencies of their usual places of Assemblies, and their Le&rehy;gal Interest in them, and the Inconveniencies of repairing unto other Assemblies, it may be far remote from their Habitations, contribute also to the Maintainance of their Teachers where it is indispensably needed.</P>
<P>If I say, all these and the like Considerations, with a Reputa&rehy;tion of publick Favour, and regard with Authority, be not suf&rehy;ficient to preserve and secure the <GO>Church</GO> in its Station, and its Members in the Communion of it, <GO>It is evident that they are things which have no Foundation in the Consciencies or Minds of Men, but stand meerly on the props of Law and Power</GO>. Which if true, is yet a Secret which ought not to be divulged.</P>
<P>I confess Chief Justice <IT>Hubbart</IT>, in his Reports, in the Case of <IT>Colt</IT>, and the Bishop of <IT>Coventry</IT> and <IT>Litchfield</IT>, says, <Q
REND="go">That though it be <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">de Jure Divino</FOREIGN>, that Christian People be provided of Christian Officers and Duties, as of Teaching, Administration of the Sacraments, and the like, and of Pastors for that purpose; and therefore to debar them wholly of it, were expresly against the Law of God</Q>; <GO>yet all other things</GO>, as he there shews, <GO>are not so:</GO> <Q
REND="go">For</Q> <RO>(saith he)</RO> <Q REND="go">We know well that the primitive Church in her greatest purity, were but Voluntary Congregations of Believers, submitting themselves to the Apostles, and after to other Pastors, to whom they did minister of their Temporals, as God did move them.</Q> A liberty for which state is pleaded for, the thing it self being owned to be according to the Pattern of the Primitive Church in her greatest Purity.</P>
<P>And if it be so as he speaks, all other Orders and Observances in the Church, must be built onely on <IT>Law</IT> and <IT>Custom</IT>. But yet such is their Force also on the minds of Men, that as atten&rehy;ded with the advantages and conveniences before mentioned, and fenced by the inconveniences and disadvantages which attend Dissenters; the Differences also contended about, being of no more weight than they are; there is no doubt but the most of men, at least to the full as many as without force to Consci&rehy;ence, will do so under the severest Penalties to the contrary, will <PB
N="28">continue their adherence to the present Church-state, although the Liberty of the dissent desired, should be indulged.</P>
<P>It may be this suggestion of Peace and Moderation, may not have an equal rellish unto all Pallats, nor find a like reception in the minds of all. The <IT>Interest</IT> of some, and the <IT>Prejudices</IT> of others, are so important with them, as that they cannot attend unto impartial Reason in this matter. I am perswaded that <IT>some</IT> have scarce any better or more forcible Argument, to satisfie their own Minds that they are in the right in Religion, than the inclination they find in themselves to hate and persecute them whom they suppose to be in the wrong; or at least that they can no longer believe that to be Truth which they profess, than whilst they are willing and ready to destroy with violence that which is contrary unto it. For what is <IT>forborn</IT>, they suppose must needs be approved; all which are so palpable misapprehensions, as there needs no Endeavour to lay them open.</P>
<P>It is far enough from being an evidence of Truth in any, that they are ready to destroy them that are otherwise minded. It is Errour and Superstition, which being conscious of their own <IT>weakness</IT>, are impatient until their Contraries are ruined. And never are there such Mutual Violences in Matters of Religion, as where the several opposite Parties are all of them most grosly er&rehy;roneous and superstitious.</P>
<P>The <IT>Egyptians</IT> were of old the scorn and sport of the World for their <IT>Devotions</IT> in general: <IT>Oxen, Apes, Crocodiles, Garlick</IT>, and <IT>Onions</IT>, being some of the best of their Deities: And yet about these they had amongst themselves such endless Animosities, and mutual Persecutions of one another, as can scarce be paral&rehy;lell'd. So he tells us:</P>
<Q REND="it" LANG="LAT"><L>Immortale odium & nunquam sanabile bellum,
</L><L>Ardet adhuc ombos & Tentyra; summus utrinque
</L><L>Inde furor vulgo, quod numina vicinorum
</L><L>Odit uterque locus.
</L></Q><P>And what was the ground and occasion of the Quarrel?
<PB N="29"><Q REND="it" LANG="lat"><L>&horfill; Crocodilon odorat
</L><L>Parsh&aelig;e, illa pavet saturam Serpentibus Ibin.</L></Q>
Their Controversie was about the Worship of a <IT>Crocodile</IT> on the one hand, and of a <IT>Fowl</IT> that <IT>devoured Serpents</IT>, on the other.
</P><P>Neither is the Difference of much more importance, or managed with much more moderation, which is at this Day between the <IT>Turks</IT> and <IT>Persians</IT>, about the true Successors of <IT>Mahomet</IT>.</P>
<P>So little Reason have Men to please themselves with a surmize of being <IT>possessed of the Truth</IT>, by the inclination that they find in themselves to persecute the contrary: Seeing such an in&rehy;clination is an inseparable Companion of Error and Superstition, and is generally heightened to Cruelty and Revenge, according as Men by them are drenched in Folly and Blindness.</P>
<P>It is yet pretended by some, <IT>That such a Toleration as will satisfie them that desire it, and secure the Publique Tranquility, however it may please in the</IT> <GO>notion</GO> <IT>of it, will yet be found</IT> <GO>un&rehy;practicable</GO> <IT>when it comes to be examined and instanced</IT>.</P>
<P>But it is evident that these pretences must be countenanced by some peculiar Consideration of this Nation, and Government thereof; seeing the utmost of what is here desired, is both esta&rehy;blished and practised in other Nations. The whole of it is plain&rehy;ly exercised in the <IT>Kingdom of France</IT>, where the <IT>Protestants</IT> paying all Duties to the Church, sustaining all Burthens and Of&rehy;fices in the Commonwealth, equal with others, are freed from <IT>Ecclesiastical Courts, Censures</IT>, and <IT>Offices</IT>, and all Penalties for their Dissent, with an <IT>allowance</IT> for the Worship of God in their own Assemblies, provided by themselves, and known to the Magistrates under whose Jurisdiction they are; which is the sum of all that is here desired. The like Liberty, if I mistake not, is granted to the <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT> Churches here in <IT>England</IT>. The <IT>United Provinces of the Netherlands</IT> have continued in the same practise ever since the Reformation. So also hath the Kingdom of <IT>Poland</IT>, where the Dissenters are both numerous, <PB
N="30">and divided among themselves. <IT>Lutherans</IT> are tolerated in the Do&rehy;minions of the <IT>Pauls-grave</IT>, Elector of <IT>Brandenburg</IT>, and Landt&rehy;grave of <IT>Hassia</IT>: So are <IT>Calvinists</IT> in many free Cities of the Empire; in some places of the Kingdom of <IT>Denmark</IT>: And both <IT>Lutherans</IT> and <IT>Calvinists</IT> in sundry Principalities in <IT>Germany</IT>, whose Magistrates are of the Roman Religion. In the <IT>Hereditary Dominions</IT> of the Emperour, where-ever Difference in Religion once made an entrance, either a Forbearance and Toleration is granted and continued, as in <IT>Hungary</IT>; or the Countries them&rehy;selves have been made utterly waste and desolate, as <IT>Bohemia</IT> and <IT>Moravia</IT>, and yet in a great measure continue so to be. The Attempts of the Duke of <IT>Savoy</IT> against it, have been condem&rehy;ned, detested and abhorred, by all Princes of the same Religion with himself, and yet have ended in some tollerable forbearance. It is also known, that the <GO>Kings of England</GO> have by vertue of their Power in things <GO>Ecclesiastical</GO>, in all Ages as occasion required, and as they saw meet, exempted Persons and Societies from the common and ordinary course and way of Church-Dis&rehy;cipline and Inspection.</P>
<P>Certainly therefore the <IT>unpracticableness</IT> of such an <GO>Indulgence</GO> lies in the desires of them, whose Interest, as they appre&rehy;hend, is opposite unto it; although it is more probable, that their Moderation known and declared in this matter, would give them a greater Interest in publique Esteem and Veneration, then by any other ways they are like to obtain. Neither is this at all by wise men to be despised, who are able to foresee the probable events of continued Exasperation. Why then should men pre&rehy;tend, that that cannot be done, which hath been done, and is done at this day in so many Kingdoms and Nations, with the wished-for success by Peace and Happiness?</P>
<P>And as it may be very <IT>few Instances</IT> can be given of such Se&rehy;verity against Dissenters, who come up to so full an <CORR
SIC="Agreemment">Agreement</CORR> in all material things with them from whom they dissent, as that of late practised, and still pressed for in <IT>England</IT>; so it will be found, that whether we respect the Nature and Temper of the People of this Land, or the admission of the Principles of Dis&rehy;sent, with the grounds of them, in Multitudes; or the Resolu<PB
N="31">tion to undergo all Difficulties and Sufferings, rather than to transgress against the Light of their Consciences; or their Va&rehy;luation of Forbearance above all Secular Things whatever: There is no Nation under Heaven, wherein such an INDULGENCE or TOLERATION as is desired, would be more Welcome, Useful, Acceptable, or more subservient to Tran&rehy;quility, Trade, Wealth and Peace.</P>
