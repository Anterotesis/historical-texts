<P>&Iic;N Christmas last past, I was intreated by some friends to write my judgement upon this yeares Actions, 1644. the 6. of January I finished it; since which time divers Coppies have been <CORR
SIC="obtanied">obtained</CORR> from me; insomuch, that fearing some Copy might surreptitiously be printed: I have given leave to a Friend for this Impres&rehy;sion. And whereas there are some months elapsed since its first writing, they that have any of my former Copies may perceive thereby, whether any materiall accidents have happened, as by me predicted, and then expect the same verity from the succeed&rehy;ing Months, sith all the judgement was drawne from the same fountaine of Learning. If this finde entertainement, thou mayest expect my Astrologicall Treatise of the ninth lesser Conjunction of <IT>Saturne</IT> and <IT>Iupiter</IT> 1642.1643. which hitherto is not handled to any purpose by any man, or to the credit of Astrology; I am therein copious, and de&rehy;liver to the world what I conceive of these our domestique Wars; when we may expect an end of them; what I conceive of most Nations of Europe; there I handle the effects of the remainder of influence of the last Comet in 1618. the cause of these Wars from the heavenly Constellations, as also the nine Conjunctions of <IT>Saturne</IT> and <IT>Iupiter</IT> in the watery Trygon, beginning in the time of <IT>Henry</IT> the sixth; as also the Conjunction of <IT>Saturne</IT> and <IT>Iupiter</IT> upon entrance of the fiery Trygon 1603. and since: If that Tractate please, I have also almost finished, <IT>The Government of the World by the seven Planetary An&rehy;gels under the severall Trygonicall Revolutions of Saturne and Iupiter</IT>, even to this yeare, from the beginning of the world. If any Astrologer of this or any other Nation, carpe at any judgement in the subsequent Discourse, I offer to maintaine against one or all the verity thereof, according to the fundamentals of Astrology: and I shall take it as an especiall favour but to receive the precise dayes of the month of any materiall accident from any well wishing Gentleman or Souldier; the better to rectifie my judgement an&rehy;other time: And I desire all English and Scottish generous Spirits to passe by the er&rehy;rours and failings of this maiden Worke (for errour there will be) so shall you engage little <IT>Merline</IT>, who is not ashamed that his name is</P><CLOSER><SIGNED><IT>William Lilly</IT>.</SIGNED><LB><IT>At the three Flower de Luces neere</IT> <LB>Somerset House, 1644.</CLOSER>

<P>&Iic; Desire to be modestly and Christianly censured for writing this subsequent discourse: <FOREIGN
REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Non quod falsa hominum judicia verear, sed ne quis nimium credulus obloquentium dictis ignorans de nobis scandalum sumat; omnis enim qu&aelig; scire unquam professus sum, cum Deo, & sine injuria fidei nostr&aelig; Christian&aelig; scio, & judicatus sum; licet ex mutis paucissimi queant inve&rehy;niri, qui mysteria occultarum influentiarum C&oelig;lestium intelligant</FOREIGN>.
</P><P>Its far from my thoughts that there's any binding or inevitable necessity in what I predict by the radiation of heavenly bodies; the stars have no such unlimited lawes, they are bounded, and give light to us or some small glimpses of the great affaires God intends upon earth, but if we rely on our judgement, without relation to the immediate rule and direction of his eternall provi&rehy;dence, alas, how soone of wise men we become errant fooles and Ideots: I have ever loathed fatall necessity, supposed by <RO>Plotinus</RO> to be maintained by <RO>Ptolomey</RO>; certainly I do not remember any Astrologicall, writer either <RO>A&rehy;rabian, Greek, Jew</RO>, or <RO>Latine</RO> that maintaines such an Atheisticall opinion. God created the heavens, Sun, Moone, fixed stars for the benefit of man, and his own glory: If the Heathens, the Caldeans, Syrians, or some absurd Indians, and Egyptians abused this knowledge, and these Celestiall creatures; shall we Christians suffer, which modestly use, but no way abuse either the Planets or their influence. We use the light of the Sun beames, we make the Sun no God, no incense do we offer; the Moone lights our wandrings in the night, and we are thankefull to God for it; by helpe of fixed stars we saile and performe many admirable secrets: By day I understand knowledge, by night ignorance: <RO>Jacob</RO> understood by the Sun himselfe, being Master of the Fa&rehy;mily, by the Moone his wife; by the <RO>II.</RO> fixed stars a multitude, &amp;c. This learning is ancient, and hath had society with Kings; its now despicable, it hath few favourers, and as few that understand it. I desire to be judged by those that apprehend something in Astrology, and not by the censorious criti&rehy;call Asse, that beleeves no influence, scarce a heaven: It was folly in me to judge of any science, I was never acquainted with; hee's as much foole as <RO>Phormio</RO> that censures my labour, and knowes not what I write of, nor the principles of that Art from which I draw my judgement; I beleeve God rules all by his divine Providence, and that the Stars by his permission are instruments whereby many contingent events may be foreseene as well in the generall accidents of the world as in particular mens fates, yet so, as, <PB
N="[iii]"><FOREIGN REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Astra nullum imperium in mentes eorum habent, qui spiritu ambulant con&rehy;sitente dominum Jesum Christum omnia in sua potestate habentem</FOREIGN>,</P>
<P>The discourse hath already found some friends, it must now expect as many enemies; I care not, I have avoided almost the termes of Art, that it might appear plaine and easie to the meanest; some things in my Copy the Li&rehy;censer expunged, its thereby lesse significant: I am contended; it might have appeared in better termes four moneths sooner, had I intended to print it. I conclude with that of Saint <RO>Augustine,</RO> <Q
LANG="LAT">Deus regit inferiora per superiora</Q>: The Planets and Stars are ministers not masters: Expect not that all accidents shall precisely happen to a day or a weeke, do not we first fit the ground, then sow, and after some expiration of time gather a crop: its impossible for the weakenesse of man at all times to hit the certaine day, or weeke of many accidents, sometimes we do, or very near, but not constantly: God keepes and reserves to himselfe many secrets, of which man hath no knowledge; he alters and changes times, seasons, and what he pleaseth, when, and where he will, so that we predict nothing but with this limitation, the hand of Almighty God considered or not impediting or preventing nature, for in his alone breast is all learning, science, knowledge, power and dominion for ever and ever.</P>

<P>If the rules of Astrology faile me not, or God Almighty cloud not my understanding, and so make me uncapable of judgement, some more then ordinary action and accidents shall this yeare happen in our Clymate, which is England; and in our neerest adjoyning neighbour Countries, which are Scotland, Ireland, France, Denmarke, the United (perhaps disjoynted) Provinces, as also in the Dominions of his Majesty of Spaine, in Flanders, and Brabant: The Celestiall Scheame it selfe is very strange, all the Angles being fixed, the Moone and <IT>Mars</IT> in fixed signes; the Sunne, <IT>Saturne Venus</IT> and <IT>Iupiter</IT> being all in the Equinoctiall and Cardinall signe<FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Aries</FOREIGN> the ascendant of England, as if by this their position they pointed out wee should have action enough, and va&rehy;riety of it, &amp;c. onely <IT>Mercury</IT> the father of lyes and untruths, and scandalous Pamplets is in a Common signe, as if he intended all this whole yeare to vex us with flying reports, continuall feares, false alarums, untoward speeches, contradictory newes, lying messen&rehy;gers, and cozening Accomptants, Receivers, Treasurers, and the like, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There doth succeed this ingresse of the Sun, two Conjunctions of <PB N="5"><IT>Mars</IT> with <IT>Saturne</IT> and <IT>Jupiter</IT> commonly called lesser Conjuncti&rehy;ons; of both which I may occasionally speake, for in their seasons they will instrumentally put forward the actions decreed by Al&rehy;mighty God for this yeare. At the time of the Suns ingresse, I finde the Moone in the tenth house seperated from an opposition of <IT>Mars; <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Accidunt rix&aelig;, mali rumores, dolores, mortes, effusiones sanguinis, falsa testimonia</FOREIGN></IT>: Bethem Apho. 37. The Moone seperated from <IT>Mars</IT>, we heare of brangling, ill rumours, sadnesse, death, the effu&rehy;sion of blood, false witnesses; she then applies to a trine aspect of <IT>Venus</IT> and <IT>Jupiter</IT>, which in the starry language tels us, that from <IT>Christmas</IT> untill our <IT>Lady</IT> day, there will be many hot skirmishes, and much bloodshed in those unseasonable times of the yeare, and principally in the <NOTE
N="(c)" PLACE="margin">This was ful&rehy;filled by the defeat the two brave Knights, Sir Tho&rehy;mas Fairfax, and Sir William Brereton gave to the Irish in the North West of this Kingdom.</NOTE> North West parts of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>And these stirring actions may be produced, by reason that <IT>Saturne</IT> and <IT>Mars</IT> the 12. of <IT>January</IT> come to a Quadrate aspect, and <IT>Mars</IT> and <IT>Jupiter</IT> on the sixt of <IT>February</IT>: Now if these Quadrate aspects of the three superiors, do in these dirty times stirre up any hostility or action, what will they do about the latter end of <IT>May</IT>, in <IT>June</IT>, and <IT>July</IT>, when they meet in Conjunction? at those times expect to heare of war, slaughter of men, division, Towns besieged, some ta&rehy;ken, some plundered, some relieved, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The precedent aspects being in Cardinall signes, shew the actions of this winter to be greater then may easily be conceived, and of greater <NOTE

<P>And yet I cannot finde it more then a likelihood of Unity, for the Proposer hereof, or Proposers, the Articles, propositions or the like, which either are or shall be framed, and are signified by <IT>Venus</IT>, and <IT>Jupiter</IT>, who behold the tenth house with trine aspect, which is of love and affection: but I say, for as much as neithe <IT>Venus</IT> or <IT>Ju&rehy;piter</IT> do behold the ascendant, which hath signification of the publique State.</P>
<P>I frame this Conjecture, that not onely they that shall frame these propositions, but the <NOTE

<P>There are also this yeare two Solar Eclipses, and they of long duration and great, though not visible in our Horizon; yet in a time of generall distemper they will operate and adde fuell to the fire: The first is in the ninteenth degree of <FOREIGN

REND="it" LANG="LAT">Magni prestantisq; viri inter&rehy;ritum, latrocinia, et rapinas terr&aelig; marique promiscuas minitatur: Proclus</FOREIGN>, it threatens the death or destruction of some eminent per&rehy;son, thefts and pillaging in a promiscous manner, as well by Sea as by Land. The second Eclipse is in <IT>August</IT>, in the ninth degree of <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Virgo: Calamitosum regis alcujus exitum & stragem ar&rehy;guit; famen, pestem, & seditiones mortalium</FOREIGN>: It argues a Tragicall end and discomfiture of some certaine King, Prince, or great man; and Hunger, Famine, the Plague, <PB
N="7">sedition or suddaine rising of men, with many miseries I forbeare to relate, cruelty, oppression, inhumanitie of the souldier, and that many Maritime Townes will be in great jeopardie, and sustaine much damage, it points out many sea fights, the death or destruction of some Empresse, Queene, Princesse, noble-woman or the like in our <IT>Europeian</IT> part of the world. Both the Revolution it selfe and the former Ecclipse acquaint us, that some Embassadour or Embassadours, Agents, Commissioners or the like from forraigne parts will arrive here to negotiate an accomodation, and in conclusion they may be discovered, or it will be doubted and mistrusted, they deale not so candidly as may or might be expected: <NOTE

I cannot say this is the man, or these the very men, but I say the most mischievous of all is such a man; one that hath formerly been imployed as Agent, Negotiator, Commissioner, Secretarie, or Embassa&rehy;dour, and is of stature pretty tall, of a swarty, sallow or Sun-burnt comp&rehy;lexion, a thin visage and ill countenance, but of a deepe and pestilent un&rehy;derstanding, he is not fluent in his speech, but covetous and envious, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> But sith <IT>Mercurie</IT> is with <IT>Cauda Draconis</IT>, and in <ADD

Doe not I evidently see, and may not a mode&rehy;rate Astrologer perceive, that their owne domestike servants shall betray them at home, and their correspondents abroad deceive them and falsifie their promises; is not <IT>Mercurie</IT> their <IT>significator peregrine</IT>, in detriment and in no support of any planetary aspect.
