<P>&Sic;WETHLAND is bounded on the East with <IT>Muscovie</IT>, on the West with the <IT>Dofrine</IT> hils which divide it from <IT>Norway</IT>; on the North with the great <IT>Frozen</IT> Ocean, spoken of before; on the South with <IT>Denmark, Liefland</IT>, and the <IT>Baltick</IT> Sea. So called from the <IT>Sueci, Suethans</IT>, or <IT>Suethidi</IT>, and the word <IT>Land</IT> added for a termination; of which more hereafter.
</P><P>It is in length from <IT>Stockholm</IT> unto the borders of <IT>Lapland</IT>, above a 1000 <IT>Italian</IT> miles; and in breadth from <IT>Stockholm</IT>, lying on the <IT>Bodner Sea</IT>, to the borders of <IT>Denmark</IT>, about twenty good dayes journey on horse-back: insomuch as they which have travelled the length and breadth of it on this side of <IT>Lapland</IT> and the <IT>Gulf</IT>, account it little lesse then all <IT>Italy</IT> and <IT>France</IT> together: but taking in <IT>Lapland</IT>, and the Provinces on the other side of the <IT>Gulf</IT>, bigger then both by the quantity of 900 miles.</P>
<P>The situation of it in regard of the heavenly bodies, is the same with <IT>Norway</IT>, under the same <IT>Pa&rehy;rallels</IT> and <IT>Degrees</IT>; but of so different a temper, both for soil and air, as if disposed of under <CORR
SIC="seve&rehy;verall">severall</CORR> and long distant <IT>Climes</IT>. For the Aire here is very pure, but not so sharp, and insupportable, as it is in <IT>Norway</IT>: though in some places where the <IT>Moores</IT> and <IT>Waters</IT> setle for want of care to open and cleanse the <IT>water-courses</IT>, they have great <IT>fogges</IT> and mists which doe somewhat putrefie it: And for the soil, it is more fertile then any of the other <IT>Northern</IT> Provinces: so that besides those necessa&rehy;ries which they keep for themselves, they usually transport into other Countries store of Malt and Barley; together with great quantities of Brasse, Lead, Steel, Copper, Iron, the hides of Goats, Bucks, Oxen, and costly furres. They have also some <IT>Mines</IT> of <IT>Silver</IT> not mixt with any other me&rehy;tall; plenty of fish in their Lakes and Rivers; abundance of <IT>Pine-trees</IT>, Firre, Oaks, both for ships and houses; yeilding besides, among the woods, good store of <IT>Tarre</IT>, and Honey, and some other necessaries. But hereof we shall speak more punctually in the severall Provinces.</P>
<P>The principall mountains of this Country are the <IT>Dofrine</IT> hils, a vast and continuall ridge of mountaines which divide it from <IT>Norway</IT>. And though they want not Rivers fit for common uses; yet partly by reason of their great frosts and flakes of Ice, partly by reason of the falling of trees which lie crosse their <IT>Channels</IT>; they have not many <IT>Navigable</IT>, or of any great fame. The principall of such as be, are 1 <IT>Meler</IT>, at the mouth whereof stands the City of <IT>Stockholm</IT>: 2 <IT>Lusen</IT>, 3 <IT>Dalecarlie</IT>, giving name to the Province so called, or as denominated from it. And of the <IT>Lakes</IT>, whereof here are exceeding many, that of most note is the lake of <IT>Werett</IT> which receiving it into 24 Rivers dis&rehy;burdneth it self at one mouth into the <IT>Baltick</IT>, with such noise and fury, that they call it commonly the <IT>Devils head</IT>.</P>
<P>The people are naturally strong and active, provident, patient, and industrious; <IT>hospitable</IT> towards strangers, whom they entertain with great humanity: so <IT>healthy</IT>, that if they doe not shorten their dayes by excesse and riot, they live commonly to 140 years of age; and so laborious, that a <IT>Begger</IT> is not seen amongst them: exceeding apt to learn as well Tongues and Sciences, as the <IT>Arts Mechanicall</IT>: <PB
N="140"><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Gothland</IT>.</NOTE>every man in a manner being his own <IT>Artificer</IT>, without imploying Smith, Mason, Carpenter, or any of other <IT>manuall</IT> trades: very valiant both on foot and horseback, which their long wars against the <IT>Danes</IT>, and their late wars in <IT>Germany</IT>, have given good proof of. Their women are discreet and mo&rehy;dest, free from that intemperance which these Northern parts are subject to. Both sexes use a corrupt <IT>Dutch</IT>, common to all three Northerne kingdoms: except in <IT>Finland</IT>, and the Provinces on the other side of the <IT>Bodner</IT> sea, where they partake somewhat of the <IT>Muscovite</IT> or <IT>Russian</IT> lan&rehy;guage.</P>
<P>The <IT>Christian Religion</IT> was first planted amongst them by the care and diligence of <IT>Ansgarius</IT> Archbishop of <IT>Breme</IT>, the <IT>Apostle</IT> general of the <IT>North</IT>; corrupt with <IT>Popish</IT> superstitions, it was <IT>reformed</IT>, accor&rehy;ding to the <IT>Augustane Confession</IT>, in the time of <IT>Gustavus Ericus</IT>, the first of the present Royall familie; sol&rehy;licited thereunto by one <IT>Petre Nevicius</IT> a <IT>Lutheran</IT> Divine, and <IT>Lawrence</IT> the <IT>Archdeacon</IT> of <IT>Strengnes</IT>; but chiefly moved (as others say) by a desire to appropriate to himselfe the <IT>goods</IT> of the <IT>Church</IT>. And this appeares to have had some strong <IT>influence</IT> upon him in it, in that he presently seised upon what he pleased; and made a <IT>Law</IT> that <IT>Bishops</IT> should enjoy no more then the King thought fit: yet having pretty well lessened their <IT>Revenues</IT>, he was content they should remain as formerly both in <IT>power</IT> and <IT>number</IT>, reserving to himselfe and his successours the <IT>nomination</IT> of the persons; but so as the <IT>appro&rehy;bation</IT> of the <IT>Clergy</IT> (in a kinde of <IT>election</IT>) doth usually goe along with the Kings appoint&rehy;ment.</P>
<P>The <IT>Bishops</IT> are in number seven, that is to say, 1 of <IT>Lincopen</IT>, containing in his Diocese 226 Pa&rehy;rishes; 2 of <IT>Vexime</IT>, under whom are 210. 3 of <IT>Scara</IT>, ruling over the same number of Churches; 4 of <IT>Strengnes</IT>, under whom are an hundred onely; 5 of <IT>Aboe</IT>, the greatest for extent of all, as com&rehy;prehending under it 500 Parishes; 6 of <IT>Wiburg</IT>, and 7 of <IT>Habsay</IT>, whose <IT>Dioceses</IT> for the most part lye out of the bounds of <IT>Sweden</IT>, in <IT>Muscovie, Livonia</IT>, and some other of the out parts of <IT>Poland</IT>: all of them under the Archbishop of <IT>Upsal</IT>, as their <IT>Metropolitan</IT>, whose <IT>Diocese</IT> extending into <IT>Lap&rehy;land</IT> and <IT>Finmarch</IT>, containeth 171 Parish Churches. By which accompt there are in all the king&rehy;dome of <IT>Swethland</IT>, but 1417 Parishes; but many of them of a thousand or eight hundred families: the people being dispersed in <IT>Forrests</IT> and other places, where they have store of <IT>timber</IT> to build them houses, and store of <IT>pasturage</IT> for their Cattell; which is the reason why they have not so many great townes, nor so well inhabited, as is usuall in far lesser Countries: As for the <IT>Authority</IT> of these <IT>Bishops</IT>, they still retaine their <IT>voice</IT> in <IT>Parliament</IT>, and with them so many of the <IT>inferiour Clergie</IT>, as are from every <IT>Socken</IT>, (a certain number of Parishes like our <IT>Rurall Deaneries</IT>) deputed to appeare there in the name of the Church: the affaires whereof the <IT>Bishops</IT> do direct and order aswell in as out of pub&rehy;lick meetings, according to the <IT>Ecclesiasticall Constitutions</IT> formerly established; and if any great occasion be, they may either advise with their <IT>Consistorials</IT>, or call a <IT>Diocesan Synod</IT>, (as they thinke most fit) and therein make such <IT>Lawes</IT> and <IT>Canons</IT>, as they conceive to be most proper for their owne edification.</P>
<P>The whole kingdom is divided into two parts, the one lying on the East, the other on the West side of the <IT>Bay</IT> or Gulf of <IT>Bodner</IT>, called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sinus Bodicus</FOREIGN> in <IT>Latine</IT>, being a large and spacious branch of the <IT>Baltick Sea</IT> extending from the most southernly point of <IT>Gothland</IT> as farre as to <IT>Lapland</IT> on the north. According to which division we have the Provinces of 1 <IT>Gothland</IT> and 2 <IT>Sweden</IT>, lying on the West side of the Gulfe; 3 <IT>Lapland</IT>, shutting it up upon the North, 4 <IT>Bodia</IT> or <IT>Bodden</IT>, and 5 <IT>Finland</IT>, on the East side thereof; and 6 the <IT>Swedish Islands</IT>, where it mingleth with the rest of the <IT>Baltick</IT>.</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>1. <IT>GOTHLAND</IT>.</HEAD>
<P><IT>GOTHLAND</IT>, is bounded on the East with the <IT>Bodner</IT> Sea, on the West with the Mountains which divide it from <IT>Norwey</IT>, and so much of <IT>Denmark</IT> as lies in the same continent with it; on the North with <IT>Sweden</IT>; on the south with the sea <IT>Baltick</IT>. So called either from the <IT>Gothes</IT>, whose origi&rehy;nall Countrey it is commonly affirmed to be; or <IT>quasi</IT> <FOREIGN

<P>It is divided commonly into <IT>Ostrogoth</IT>, or <IT>East Gothland; Westergoth</IT>, divided from the former by the great lake of <IT>Weret</IT> spoken of before; and <IT>South Gothland</IT>, subdivided into <IT>Smalandia, Tuiscia</IT>, and <IT>Verendia</IT>. Chief townes whereof in <IT>Ostrogoth</IT>, are 1 <IT>Lincopen</IT>, a <IT>Bishops</IT> See; 2 <IT>Loduse</IT>, adorned with a very fair Haven: in <IT>Westergoth</IT>, 3 <IT>Scara</IT> on the lake <IT>Weret</IT>, a <IT>Bishops</IT> See also; 4 <IT>Elseburg</IT> on the We&rehy;stern sea, betwixt <IT>Denmark</IT> and <IT>Norwey</IT>; a place of consequence; and flankerd with two very strong Castles in the parts adjoining, the one called <IT>Croneberg</IT>, and the other <IT>Goldberg</IT>. 5 <IT>Tragualle</IT>, remark&rehy;able for iron workes, occasioned by the <IT>mines</IT> adjoining. And finally in <IT>South Gothland</IT>, there is 6 <IT>Vexim</IT>, or <IT>Vexio</IT>, another of the <IT>Episcopall</IT> Sees: 7 <IT>Walburg</IT>, a reasonable fair Town, with a strong Castle. 8 <IT>Rottenby</IT>, and 9 <IT>Elcholm</IT> in <IT>Verendia</IT>, neer the confines of <IT>Denmark</IT>, 10 <IT>Colmar</IT>, a noted and well traded Port on the <IT>Baltick</IT> Sea, beautified with a Castle not inferiour to that of <IT>Millain</IT>; and so well fortified throughout, that at the taking of it by <IT>Christiern</IT> the fourth of <IT>Denmark</IT>, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">anno</FOREIGN> 1611. there were found mounted on the Workes 108 brasse peeces of Ordinance, six <PB

<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Gothes</IT></NOTE> The first Inhhabitants of these south parts of <IT>Scandia</IT>, are commonly affirmed to have beene the <IT>GOTHES</IT>, whom <IT>Jornandes</IT> in his Book <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de Rebus Geticis</FOREIGN>, makes to have issued out of this countrey, and to plant themselves on the north bankes of the <IT>Ister</IT>, nere the <IT>Euxine</IT> sea, some time before the <IT>Trojan</IT> war: ascribing to them whatsoever is reported in old writers of the antient <IT>Scythians</IT>, as their encounter with <IT>Vexoris</IT> or <IT>Sesostris</IT> the King of <IT>Egypt</IT>, the Act and acheivements of the <IT>Amazons</IT>, their congresse with <IT>Alexander</IT> the <IT>Great</IT> in his <IT>Persian</IT> war, and the like to these. In which <IT>Jornandes</IT> be&rehy;ing himself a <IT>Goth</IT>, is no more to be credited, then <IT>Geofrie</IT> of <IT>Monmouth</IT> a <IT>Welchman</IT>, in the storie of <IT>Brute</IT> and his successours, to whom he doth ascribe the taking and sack of <IT>Rome</IT> under the conduct of <IT>Brennus</IT>, whom he makes to be the brother of <IT>Belinus</IT> a King of <IT>Britain</IT>. Most probable it is that they were originally a <IT>Dutch</IT> or <IT>German</IT> people, part of the great Nation of the <IT>Suevi</IT>, called by <IT>Ta&rehy;citus</IT> the <IT>Gothones</IT>, inhabiting in his time (as it is conceived) in the land of <IT>Prussia</IT>. Who finding their own countrey too narrow for them might passe over the <IT>Baltick</IT> into the next adjoining Regions: and not well liking that cold clime might afterwards in some good numbers goe to seek new dwellings, and at lest seat themselves on the bankes of <IT>Ister</IT>, where <IT>Jornandes</IT> found them. That they were <IT>Dutch</IT> originally, besides the generall name of the <IT>Gothones</IT> or <IT>Gothes</IT>, and those of <IT>Ostro&rehy;gothes</IT>, and <IT>Wisigothes</IT>, into which they were afterwards divided; the particular names of <IT>Alaric, Theodorick, Riccared</IT>, (the names of their Kings and Captains) seem to me to evidence. That they were once seated in this Countrie doth appeare as plainly 1 by the name of <IT>Gothland</IT> here still remaining; 2 by the title of <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex Gothorum</FOREIGN>, which the Kings of <IT>Swethland</IT> keep in the <IT>Royall style</IT>; and 3 by some inscriptions in antient unknown <IT>Charcters</IT> engraven on the rocks neere <IT>Scara</IT> in the Continent, and <IT>Wisby</IT> in the Isle of <IT>Gothland</IT>, supposed by learned men to be some monument of that people. And finally that their fixt dwellings, when first known by this name amongst the <IT>Romans</IT>, was on the north side of the <IT>Ister</IT>; is evident by the testimony of all antient Writers, from the time of <IT>An&rehy;toninus Caracalla</IT>, with whom they had some <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">tumultuarie</FOREIGN> skirmishes in his way towards <IT>Persia</IT>; till their violent irruption into <IT>Italie</IT> and the Western Provinces: most famous in this <IT>intervall</IT> for a great fight with <IT>Decius</IT> the <IT>Roman</IT> Emperour, whom they overcame and slew in battell, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">anno</FOREIGN> 253. In the time of <IT>Valens</IT> and <IT>Valentinian</IT> the <IT>Roman</IT> Emperours a quarrell being grown amongst them, managed by <IT>Phritigernes</IT> and <IT>Athanaricus</IT> the leaders of the opposite factions, <IT>Phritigernes</IT> over throwne in fight had recourse to <IT>Valens</IT>, from whom he received such succours, that giving his adversary another day for it, he obtained the victory. Whereupon <IT>Phritigernes</IT> and his partie received the Gospell, but in&rehy;termixt and corrupt with the <IT>leaven</IT> of <IT>Arianism</IT>, by the practise of <IT>Valens</IT>, who sent them none but <IT>A&rehy;rian</IT> teachers, to whom and their faction in the Church, he was wholly addicted. Afterwards the whole Nation being driven over the <IT>Ister</IT> by the barbarous <IT>Huns</IT>, they obtained of <IT>Valens</IT> the out parts of <IT>Thrace</IT> for an habitation, on the condition they should serve under the pay of the Emperour, and become <IT>Christians</IT>: the cause that <IT>Arianism</IT> overspread the whole Nation generally, which had before infected but one partie onely. <IT>Ulphilas</IT> a devout and learned man, was their first Bishop; who for their bet&rehy;ter edification in the way of <IT>godlinesse</IT>, invented the <IT>Gothick Characters</IT>, and <IT>translated</IT> the <IT>Scriptures</IT> in&rehy;to that language: in the studie whereof they so well profited, that many of them in the time of their first <IT>conversion</IT>, suffered death for it at the hands of <IT>Athanaricus</IT>, and were counted <IT>Martyrs</IT>. Burdned by <IT>Valens</IT>, and denyed their accustomed pay, they harasse and depopulate the rest of <IT>Thrace</IT>, march&rehy;ing towards <IT>Constantinople</IT>: encountred in the way by <IT>Valens</IT>, whom they overcame, and killed, af&rehy;ter all his favours. Vanquished by <IT>Theodosius</IT> the succeeding Emperour in many battels, they became good neighbours, inlarging their bounds with his leave and license as far as <IT>Pannonia</IT>, and grown into such estimation with him that <IT>Ricimir</IT> and <IT>Franita</IT>, two of that Nation, did obtaine the <IT>Consul&rehy;ship</IT>: not to say any thing of that exorbitant power and favour which <IT>Gainas</IT> had attained unto in the Court it selfe. Made insolent by so great honours, and apt to pick quarrels with their <IT>Patrons</IT>, they invaded <IT>Italy</IT> in two great bodies, consisting of no fewer then 200000 fighting men: the first whereof under the conduct of <IT>Rhadaguisus</IT>, was discomfited and cut in pieces by <IT>Stilico</IT> Lieutenant to <IT>Honorius</IT> the <IT>Western</IT> Emperour, at <IT>Fesul&aelig;</IT> in the straits of the <IT>Appennine</IT>: the other by his treachery permitted to passe, sacked <IT>Rome</IT>, and subdued the most part of <IT>Italy</IT>, under the leading of <IT>Alaricus</IT>. He dying immediately after this great victory, left the fruits of it to his son <IT>Athaulfus</IT>, who marry&rehy;ing with <IT>Galla Placidia</IT>, the Emperours sister, relinquished <IT>Italy</IT>, and had all <IT>Gaul Narbonnoise</IT>, and a great part of <IT>Hispania Tarraconensis</IT> assigned unto him: where he erected the kingdome of the <IT>Wisi&rehy;Gothes</IT>, or <IT>Western Gothes</IT>, possessed of <IT>Spain</IT> and <IT>Tingitana</IT>, for the space of 300 years, and upward, when they lost that kingdome to the <IT>Moores</IT>, as hath there been said. In the meane time the <IT>Gothes</IT> which were left in their owne countries, distinguished from these by the name of <IT>Ostro-Gothes</IT> by rea&rehy;son of their more <IT>Eastern</IT> situation, kept themselves in quiet, first subdued by the <IT>Huns</IT>, and when by <IT>Wilamer</IT>, freed from that subjection, not intermedling or attempting any thing against the Em&rehy;pire, till called by <IT>Zeno</IT> Emperour of <IT>Constantinople</IT> into <IT>Italie</IT>, against <IT>Odoacer</IT> and the <IT>Heruli</IT>, who had then subdued it. Which action they managed with so much prudence and good fortune by their King <IT>Theodorick</IT>, that they vanquished <IT>Odoacer</IT>, possessed <IT>Italie</IT>, and held it above 60 yeares, when broken in many set battels by <IT>Belisarius</IT> and <IT>Narses</IT>, Lieutenants for the Emperour <IT>Justinian</IT>, their Kingdome and name there came unto an end.</P>
<P>As for the Kings of the <IT>Gothes</IT>, we have a succession of them in <IT>Jornandes</IT>, from <IT>Berig</IT>, who first conducted them out of <IT>Scandia</IT> towards the East, till the going of <IT>Theodorick</IT> into <IT>Italie</IT>: but made <PB

<P>And as the largest and principall part of this great body it containes in it many Provinces, and subdivisions, as namely 1 <IT>Upland</IT>, 2 <IT>Suderman</IT>, 3 <IT>Noricia</IT>, 4 <IT>Westman</IT>, 5 <IT>Dalecarle</IT>, 6 <IT>Wermelund</IT>, 7 <IT>Cop&rehy;perdale</IT>, 8 <IT>Gestricia</IT>, 9 <IT>Helsingen</IT>, 10 <IT>Middelphat</IT>, 11 <IT>Angerman</IT>, bordering on <IT>Lapland</IT>, the furthest of these Provinces towards the North. Many of which have no Townes or Cities of any greatnesse or beauty, the people living thin, and scattered, where they have <IT>wood</IT> for building, <IT>pasturage</IT> for their Beasts, and elbow roome enough for themselves and their Cattell. Of these the principall are 1 <IT>Upsal</IT>, an <IT>Archbishops</IT> See, and an <IT>Universitie</IT>, situate not far from the Bay of <IT>Bodner</IT>: beautified with a large <IT>Cathedrall</IT>, wherein many of the antient Kings of <IT>Swethland</IT> are interred.

<P>1 <IT>FINMARCH</IT>, being that part hereof which lyeth next to <IT>Norwey</IT>, is the more populous of the two, the people for the most part <IT>idolatrous</IT>, but by the neighbourhood of the <IT>Norwegians</IT>, and resort of strangers unto <IT>Wardhuys</IT>, and the parts adjoining, somewhat <IT>civilized</IT>; and in the borders of both king&rehy;doms savouring of <IT>Religion</IT>, possessed of <IT>sheds</IT> or sorry houses, & those house reduced to parishes, under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of <IT>Upsal</IT>, the chiefe of which, (if there be any chief amongst them) are named 1 <IT>Samman</IT>, and 2 <IT>Hielso</IT>.

<P>2 <IT>SCRICFINNIA</IT> lyeth between <IT>Finmarch</IT> and <IT>Russia</IT>, the name derived from the <IT>Finni</IT>, a great people of <IT>Scandia</IT>, and <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="DUT">Scriken</FOREIGN> a <IT>Dutch</IT> word signifying <IT>leaping, sliding</IT> or bounding, for such is their gate. An <IT>etymologie</IT> not much improbable, in that the <IT>wooden-soled shoes</IT> with sharp bottomes, which <PB

<P>These are indeed the naturall and proper <IT>Laplanders</IT>; and unto these the former <IT>character</IT> doth of right belong. Of stature very low, little more then <IT>Pigmeys</IT>, but strong and active, well skilled in <IT>Archerie</IT>, and patient of cold and labour. Much given to hunting of wild beasts whom they kill with their bowes, devoure the flesh, and cloath themselves with their skins, which they tie at the top of their heads, and leave no place open but for the sight, giving thereby occasion unto some to write, that they are <IT>hairie</IT> all over like kine or horses. Such <IT>Deere</IT> (whereof they have great plenty) as they take unkilled, they make to draw in little <IT>carts</IT>, as they shift their <IT>Quarters</IT>. But having served them for a while they are killed at last, though perhaps for nothing but their skinnes; a certaine number of which they pay yeerly to the King of <IT>Sweden</IT> in the way of <IT>tribute</IT>. Three companies of these <IT>Laplanders</IT>, so clad and armed as aforesaid, came into <IT>Germanie</IT> in the year 1630 to serve <IT>Gu&rehy;stavus</IT> in those wars; looked on with admiration by all <IT>spectators</IT>.</P>
<P>Townes we must look for none here, where no houses be: and yet there are some <IT>sheds</IT> and <IT>cabbins</IT> on the Sea shore; which <IT>Mariners</IT> having made for their refreshment when they came on land, have bestowed some names on, and possibly in time may become good townes, now not worth the naming.</P>

The countrey not very plentifull of grain or fruites, but full of great variety of wilde beasts, whose <IT>rich skins</IT> yeeld great profit unto the Inhabitants; and by reason of the commodious situation on all sides of the <IT>Bay</IT>, well stored with Fish.

<P>1. <IT>GOTHIA</IT>, or the Isle of <IT>GOTHLAND</IT>, is situate over against <IT>Colmar</IT>, a strong town in the Continent of <IT>Gothland</IT>; in length 18 <IT>Dutch</IT> miles, and five in breadth. Of a rich soile, but more fit for pasturage then tillage, yeelding great heards of Cattell, store of game for hunting, plenty of fish, excellent marble, and aboundance of pitch, which it sends forth to other Countreys.

REND="it" LANG="LAT">anno</FOREIGN> 1170) made it flourish mightily: the greatest traffick of the <IT>Baltick</IT> being managed here: but after that by reason of the long and continuall wars betwixt <IT>Denmark</IT> and <IT>Swethland</IT> for the possession of this Isle, it became unsafe; the <IT>Factorie</IT> was transferred unto other places.

By some conceived to be the <IT>Eningia</IT> spoken of by <IT>Pliny</IT>.</P>
<P>2 <IT>OELAND</IT>, or this Isles of <IT>Ulandt</IT>, so called in the plurall number because there are many of them, of which this the principall, is situate over against <IT>Abo</IT>, the chief City of <IT>Finland</IT>.

<P>The first Inhabitants of this kingdome, besides the <IT>Gothes</IT> and <IT>Finni</IT>, spoken of already, were the <IT>Sitones</IT>, and <IT>Suiones</IT>, mentioned in <IT>Tacitus</IT>; together with the <IT>Phavon&aelig;</IT>, the <IT>Phir&aelig;si</IT>, and the <IT>Levoni</IT>, whom we finde in <IT>Ptolemie</IT>, placed by him in the East and middle of this great <IT>Peninsula</IT>. Which being the generall names of some mighty Nations, are by <IT>Jornandes</IT> branched into lesser tribes, of the <IT>Suethans, Theustad, Vagoth, Bergio, Hallin, Liothida, Athelnil, Gaurigoth, Raumaric&aelig;, Rauragnicii, Grannii, Aganzi&aelig;, Unix&aelig;, Arochitamii, Enager&aelig;, Othingi</IT>, and divers others by him named. But from what root the name of <IT>Sweden, Swedes</IT>, or <IT>Swethland</IT>, by which the chief Province of it, the people generally, and the whole kingdome is now called, is not yet agreed on, nor spoken of at all by <IT>Munster</IT> or <IT>Crantzius</IT>, which two, (but specially the last) have written purposely of this people. <IT>Gaspar Peucerus</IT> deriveth them from the <IT>Suevi</IT>, who antiently inhabited in the North parts of <IT>Germanie</IT> beyond the <IT>Albis</IT>; from whom the <IT>Baltick</IT> sea was called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Mare Suevicum</FOREIGN>: which people hee conceiveth to have beene driven by the <IT>Gothes</IT> and <IT>Daci</IT> into this countrey, and by the change of one letter onely to be called <IT>Sueci</IT>. But this hath no good ground to stand on, though I meet with many others which are more improbable. For when they left those colder countreys, they fell into these parts which are still called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Suevia</FOREIGN> (the <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="GER">Schwaben</FOREIGN> of the modern <IT>Dutch</IT>) where we finde them in the time of <IT>C&aelig;sar</IT>. And after, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">in fatali illa gen&rehy;tium commigratione</FOREIGN>, when almost all the Northern Nations did shift their seats, we finde such of them as had staid behinde, to have accompanied the <IT>Vandals</IT>, in their on-fals into <IT>Gaul</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT>. Of any expedition of theirs crosse the <IT>Baltick</IT> seas, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ne gry quidem</FOREIGN>, nothing to be found in more antient Authors. We must therefore reserve the originall of this people either to the <IT>Suiones</IT>, or the <IT>Suethidi</IT>, or per&rehy;haps to both: both being antiently setled in these Northern Regions. Of the <IT>Suiones</IT> wee read in the booke of <IT>Tacitus</IT> inscribed <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">De moribus Germanorum</FOREIGN>; by whom reported to be strong in men, ar&rehy;mour and shipping: and that they were inhabitants of <IT>Scandia</IT>, appeares by two circumstances in that Authour. 1 That the people were not permitted to weare weapons, <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">quia subitos hostium incursus prohibet Oceanus</Q>, because the Ocean was to them a sufficient Rampart; which could not be affirmed of the antient <IT>Suevians</IT>, but agreeth very well with the situation of this present Countrey, defended by the <IT>Baltick</IT>, and vast Northern Ocean, from the sudden assaults of any enemy. 2. Because the Sea which hemmed in that people was conceived to be the utmost bound of the World; <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">trans <RO>Suiones</RO> mare aliud, quo cingi claudique terrarum orbis finis</Q>, as his words there are: which wee know to hold good of this Countrey. Adde unto these this passage of the old Annals of the Emperour <IT>Lewis</IT> the second, where it is told us of the <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Danes, relicta patria apud <RO>Suiones</RO> exulabant</Q>, that they were banished into the countrey of the <IT>Suiones</IT>, which cannot so well be understood of any place as of this <IT>Sweden</IT>; being next neighbour unto <IT>Denmark</IT>. And 4 that this people both by <IT>Munster</IT> and <IT>Crantzius</IT>, are as well called <IT>Suiones</IT> as <IT>Sueci</IT> or <IT>Suedi</IT>: which sheweth what they conceived of their true Originall. Then for <PB
N="146">the <IT>Suethans</IT> or the <IT>Suethidi</IT>, whom <IT>Jornandes</IT> speaks of in his book <FOREIGN

<DIV TYPE="part"><P>But leaving these things to the doubtfull issue of <IT>contingencie</IT>, let us next looke upon the <IT>forces</IT> and <IT>Revenues</IT> of the Crowne of <IT>Sweden</IT>, before the time of <IT>Gustavus Adolphus</IT>, or as hee found it at his succession to that Crowne. For though the <IT>Swedes</IT> pretend their Kingdome to be <IT>elective</IT>, especially since the failing of the Royall line in <IT>Magnus</IT> the fourth and <IT>Albert</IT> of <IT>Mecklenbourg</IT>; yet still the eldest son, or next heir succeedeth, unlesse put by, by faction and strong hand, as in the case of <IT>Sigismund</IT>, and his Uncle <IT>Charles</IT>. Which <IT>Charles</IT> so ordered his affaires that having engaged the kingdome in a warre against his <IT>Nephew</IT>, hee was sollicited at the last to accept of the Crowne: to which he would by no meanes yeeld till a Law was made for the entail&rehy;ing of the same for ever unto his posterity, whether male or female, as an <IT>Hereditary</IT> Crown. But whether <IT>Hereditary</IT> or <IT>Elective</IT>, the King once setled in the Throne is an <IT>absolute Monarch</IT>: ha&rehy;ving not onely power to <IT>levie taxes</IT> on his subjects, as hee seeth occasion, as five, six, seven, eight <IT>dollars</IT>, or more yearely, upon every housholder, according to the <IT>Proportion</IT> of his estate; <PB
N="148">but also to <IT>grant</IT> a certaine number of <IT>Paisants</IT> unto such as hee meanes to favour, to bee as <IT>subjects</IT> and <IT>vassals</IT> to him, according to his well deserving. And whereas in the <IT>constitution</IT> of this <CORR
SIC="Govervment"><IT>Government</IT></CORR> every <IT>Parish</IT> hath a <IT>Landsman</IT> or <IT>Consul</IT> to decide the controversies of the same; as every <IT>Territorie</IT> hath its <IT>Vicount</IT> and each <IT>Province</IT> his <IT>Lamen</IT>: there lyeth an <IT>Appeal</IT> from the <IT>Landsman</IT> unto the <IT>Vicount</IT>, and from the <IT>Vicount</IT> to the <IT>Lamen</IT>; who if they bee supposed not to judge uprightly, then the <IT>Appeale</IT> lies unto the <IT>Counsell</IT>, and from the <IT>Counsell</IT> of <IT>Estate</IT> to the <IT>King</IT> himselfe, (in whom is fixed the <IT>Soveraignty</IT> and <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="FRA">DERNIER RESORT</FOREIGN>) and not unto the <IT>King</IT> and <IT>Counsell</IT>, as before in <IT>Denmark</IT>.
</P><P>The <IT>Forces</IT> of this King are either by Sea, or Land. By Sea, hee is Commander wholly of <IT>Bodner</IT>, and hath a great power in all the rest of the <IT>Baltick</IT>: being able to set out 70 good <IT>Men of Warre</IT>; as <IT>John</IT> the second did in the yeare 1578. seven of which were good <IT>Gal&rehy;lions</IT>; and all the rest did carry above 50 cast peeces of all sorts; besides many other good Vessels fit for service. And if a <IT>Navie</IT> of this size will not serve the turne, hee is not onely fur&rehy;nished with timber, cordage, and all other necessaries for the building of Ships, and with good store of <IT>Ordinance</IT> and Ammunition for present use; but is able to raise upon a sudden 6000 Mariners, and upon little warning as many more: all which hee entertaineth at no o&rehy;ther charges in a manner then to finde them victuals, insomuch as <IT>John</IT> the second before mentioned did use to say, that that <IT>which cost the King of</IT> Spaine <IT>a Million of Crownes, cost not him</IT> 100000 <IT>Dollars</IT>.</P>
<P>For his <IT>Land-forces</IT>, they may best be estimated by the <IT>Trained Bands</IT>, (as wee may call them) in every Province: there being in all 32 <IT>Vexilles</IT> (or Ensignes) of <IT>Foot</IT> constantly trained and mustered in the severall Provinces; each <IT>Vexille</IT> comprehending 600 or 700 men, amounting in the totall to 20000 Foot, all in a manner <IT>Musketiers</IT>, ready to march whensoever the Kings occasion shall so require. And then for <IT>Horse</IT> there are eleven <IT>Cornets</IT> in continuall readinesse, for <IT>Sweden</IT>, and <IT>Gothland</IT>, and two for <IT>Finland</IT>, maintained at the charges of those Countries, to which the King may adde at his owne charges, as many more as hee pleaseth. And for an instance of what this King is able to doe, without putting his estates in hazard by drayning them too drye of men to make good his kingdome; wee finde that <IT>John</IT> the second in his Navie of 70 Ships spoken of before, had above 18000 <IT>Land-souldiers</IT>, beside Mariners: And in the Army, which <IT>Gustavus Adolphus</IT> the late King brought into <IT>Germanie</IT>, there were mustered no fewer at one time then 12000 <IT>Horse</IT>, and 34000 Foot, all <IT>Finnes</IT>, and <IT>Swethlanders</IT>. For the accommo&rehy;dating of which Armies with <IT>Artillerie</IT>, and the like Engines of war, it is thought that the kings here&rehy;of are masters of 8000 great peeces, for the most part brasse, with <IT>Mortar</IT> peeces and <IT>Granadoes</IT> in pro&rehy;portion to them.</P>
<P>But that which makes his <IT>Land-forces</IT> most considerable is their hardnesse in enduring the ex&rehy;tremities of winde and weather, insomuch that it is usuall with them to stand <IT>Centinell</IT> a whole Winters night of 18 houres long without being <IT>relieved</IT>: their exact Discipline, and obedience to their Commanders, and finally their indefatigable industry in making their owne shoes, Apparrels, stockes for Muskets, and all other necessaries. Which doth not onely make them fit to endure any labour which is put upon them in the warres; but keepes them from idle&rehy;nesse, and the pride of Mutinies, the ordinary effect in great Armies of sloth and ease. Nor doe they want incouragement on the Kings part neither; who first, gives to every souldier vi&rehy;ctuals, which hee accompts not in their pay, and that according to his obedience and desert; 2. If a souldier be taken Prisoner, him the King doth usually redeem at his owne charges: and 3 if a souldiers horse be slain under him, the King supplyeth him with another: which makes the souldiers (very sensible of such obligations) exceedingly conformable unto his commands, how dan&rehy;gerous soever they may seem to be.</P>
<P>Finally as for his <IT>Revenues</IT> they must needes bee great, there being foure wayes allowed him to amasse his treasures. First the <IT>Revenues</IT> of the Church, consisting before the <IT>Reformation</IT> of seven Bishopricks and sixty Monasteries, which enjoyed very great possessions; all seized on by <IT>Gustavus Ericus</IT>, and by him incorporate to the Crowne; excepting onely what is given back to maintaine the Bishops. 2 <IT>Mines</IT>, which are here of all metalls in very great plenty, except of <IT>Gold</IT> and <IT>Silver</IT>, which they have more sparingly; the <IT>tenth</IT> whereof in all places belongs to the King, and yeelds him such a fair <IT>Intrado</IT>, that in the yeare 1578. the Kings part out of two or three <IT>Mines</IT> of <IT>Copper</IT> onely amounted to 30000 <IT>Dollars</IT>. 3 <IT>Tenths</IT>, out of all increase, as Rie, Wheat, Barley, Fish, Oxen, Skinnes, and the like commodities; the summe whereof though not certainly knowne (because the increase is so uncertaine) yet it was once compu&rehy;ted that the <IT>tenth</IT> of the Oxen onely came in one yeare to 18000 <IT>Dollars</IT>, besides provision for his houshold. 4 And lastly, <IT>Customes</IT> imposed on <IT>Merchandise</IT>, and paid in all his Haven Townes for all commodities <IT>imported</IT>, or <IT>exported</IT> of what sort soever. Besides all which hee hath his <IT>Contributions</IT> in all times of warre, power of imposing taxes (though moderately used) as his necessities require: and on the <IT>marriage</IT> of a <IT>daughter</IT>, the kingdome is to provide her portion, which of late times hath beene fixed at the certaine summe of 100000 <IT>Dollars</IT>, besides Plate and <IT>Moveables</IT>. Out of which severall <IT>Items</IT> to summe up the <IT>totall</IT>, it was observed that in the yeare 1578. King <IT>John</IT> the second, (all charges ordinary and extraordinary being first deducted) did lay up in his Treasurie no lesse then 700000 <IT>Dollars</IT>: which was a vast summe for those times, considering especially the great charge which the King had beene at that yeare, in fur<PB
N="149">nishing a Navie of 70 sayle, and raising 18000 <IT>Land-souldiers</IT>, (besides Horse) for defence of his Realme against the <IT>Danes</IT>. And yet it is conceived by some knowing men that his <IT>Re&rehy;venues</IT> would be much greater then they are, if hee did employ strangers to worke the <IT>mines</IT>, which the Natives doe not husband to the best advantage; and yet are fearfull to discover them to other Nations, upon some <IT>jealousies</IT> which they are naturally addicted to: or if hee would turne <IT>Merchant</IT>, and in his owne ships send out <IT>Corn</IT> and <IT>Cordage</IT> with Masts and Timber fit for building, and in them bring back salt and other necessaries, which his kingdome wants, setting them at a farre lesse price then now they goe at, and yet gaining very greatly by it too.</P>
