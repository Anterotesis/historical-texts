<P>&Sic;<IT>Ir William Courten</IT> late of London Mer&rehy;chant, <IT>Endimion Porter</IT>, Esquire, <IT>John Weddal, Na&rehy;thaniel Mountney, George Townesend, Thomas Kyn&rehy;naston</IT>, Merchants, and divers others Participants with them, set forth severall great Shipps, laden with money and Marchandizes, for the Coast of In&rehy;dia, China & Japan the Years 1636. 1637. & fol&rehy;lowing Years, for trading voyages persuant to their letters Patents under the great Seal of England.
</P><P>After the death of <IT>Sir William Courten, William Courten</IT> his Son and Heir, and the surviving Partners, set forth the said Ships <IT>Bona Esperanza & Henry Bonadventura (<FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">inter alia</FOREIGN></IT>) in the Year 1641. for supply of their Factories, and to bring home their Effects from India and Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>Afterwards <IT>William Courten</IT> being indebted to divers Persons, in severall great sommes of Money, amounting unto 100000. Pounds and upwards, for which <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>, his Brother in law, stood obliged; The said <IT>William Courten</IT> did by his indenture and Bill of sale dated the 26. day of April 1642. graunt and assign all his Interest and share of stock in the said Ships and Factories in India to <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>, for his indemp&rehy;tnity from the said debts, provided the surplus should be returned to the said <IT>Courten</IT>.</P>
<P>Afterwards <IT>William Courten</IT> and <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>, reciting the first Bill of sale and a great debt of 24800 Pounds due to <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT>, they graunt and assign unto <IT>Sir Paul</IT> all their Interest and share of stock, in the Ships <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT> with all Freights, and pro<PB
N="6">ceeds by a tripartite Indenture and Bill of Sale dated the 19. of December 1642. Provided that the surplus should be applyed towards the discharge of <IT>Sir Edward Littleton's</IT> engagements.</P>
<P>On the 25. of June in the Year 1643, the said Ship <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> with her lading, was taken in an hostile manner in the Streights of <IT>Mallacca</IT>, in her passage from <IT>Goa</IT> towards <IT>Maccao</IT> in <IT>China</IT>, by two Ships of Warr cal&rehy;led the <IT>Vendilo</IT> and <IT>Portogallo</IT>, commanded by Captain <IT>Vermeerren</IT> and Cap&rehy;tain <IT>Geeland</IT> (and the Lieutenant of the Fort at <IT>Mallacca</IT>) belonging to the East-India Company of the Netherlands, under a pretence that Mr. <IT>Courten</IT> and his Partners, traded with the Portugalls their Ennemies, not&rehy;withstanding there was a Truce made between the King of <IT>Portugall</IT>, and the States Generall, for ten Years in all <CORR
SIC="parrs">parts</CORR> of <CORR SIC="rhe">the</CORR> Indies and Europe, which was concluded at the Hague on the 12. of June 1641. by <IT>Don Tristao de Mendoca Furtado</IT>, Embassadour from <IT>Don Iuan</IT> King of <IT>Portugall</IT>.</P>
<P>In the same Year 1643. the Officers of the said East-India Company toke the Ship <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT> with her lading into their possession, near the Island <IT>Mauritius</IT>, and converted both the Ships and Goods to their own use, to the loss and dammage of Mr. <IT>Courten</IT> and his Assigns, and the rest of the Partners, the summe of 85000 Pound Sterling, as by the proofs taken in the High Court of Admirallity in <IT>England</IT> appears.</P>
<P>On the 5. of September 1644, the Proprietors having addressed them&rehy;selves to the High Court of Admirallity, and procured an Admonition to be given unto <IT>Monsr. Albertus Ioachimy</IT>, the States Embassadour then re&rehy;sident in England, Intimating that they intended to examine Witnesses, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in perpetuam rei memoriam</FOREIGN></IT>, concerning the spoyls and dammages of the said Ships and lading; Which Admonition was also affixed upon one of the Pillars of the <IT>Royall Exchange</IT>, where it remayned eight dayes publickly, to the end that the East-India Company of the Netherlands, or any Person for them, might retain a Proctor to cross examine any of the said Wit&rehy;nesses if they pleased.</P>
<P>In the Year 1647. <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> makes a <CORR SIC="Ptocuration">Procuration</CORR> or Letter of at&rehy;torney to <IT>Jonas Abeels</IT> of Amsterdam Merchant, dated the 11. of Fe&rehy;bruary 1647/8. old Stile, and also sent him an authentick Copie of the said tripartite indenture, attested by <IT>Iosua Maniet</IT> of London Publicq No&rehy;tary.</P>
<P>In the Year following <IT>William Courten</IT> being insolvent by reason of other losses, absented himself and went privately to the Hague to <IT>Mr. Ia&rehy;cob Pergens</IT>, who was not ignorant of the Premises in every circumstance, having received the particulars of the dammages amounting unto 85000. <PB
N="7">Pound, yet nevertheless to imbroil the Subjects of both Nations, he perswaded <IT>Mr. Courten</IT> to make another Bill of sale dated the 22. of Fe&rehy;bruary 1647/8. reciting therein that <IT>Mr. Courten</IT> being indebted to the said <IT>Mr. Pergens</IT> in severall summes of monie, he graunted and assigned all his right and interest in the said Ships and lading to him the said <IT>Pergens</IT>, Pro&rehy;vided that <IT>Pergens</IT> should pay the surplus over and above his pretended debt to such person and persons lawfully clayming under <IT>Courten</IT>, which bill of sale was signed by <IT>William Courten</IT> and <IT>Iacob Pergens</IT>, and attested by <IT>Domi&rehy;nique Coulyn, David Goubard</IT>, and <IT>Salomon van der Heyde</IT> Publicq Notary in the Hague.</P>
<P>In the moneth of May following <IT>Gerrit Coren</IT> Publicq Notary at Am&rehy;sterdam by order of <IT>Ionas Abeels</IT>, insinuated his Procuration from <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> and the Originall bill of sale from <IT>William Courten</IT> and <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>, to the Directors of the East India Company, interdicting their payment of any monie for <IT>Courtens</IT> share and stock in the Shipps and lading aforesaid to any person or persons whatsoever, but unto the said <IT>Ionas A&rehy;beels</IT> in right of <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT>, <CORR
SIC="ptotesting">protesting</CORR> that if they did otherwise it should be no discharge unto them; which insinuation and Protest was done by the said Notary Publicq on the 25. of May 1648. in the Assembly of the said Directors at their Chamber in Amsterdam in the presence of <IT>Ian Iansen</IT> and <IT>Adrian Nys</IT> witnesses thereunto.</P>
<P>In the Moneth of October following, <IT>Ionas Abeels</IT> caused to be arrested in the hands of the said East India Company alle such summes of mony as should be found due from the said Company concerning the said two Shipps and their lading, that out of the said monies <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> share and pro&rehy;portion should be paid in the first place to him the said <IT>Ionas Abeels</IT> in his quallity; which Arrest was made the first of October 1648. by <IT>Goosen Da&rehy;niels</IT> Bode or Messenger; And a second Arrest was made by <IT>Willem Ian&rehy;sen</IT> Bode or Messenger, in November following both which the Court de&rehy;clared to be valid.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these Admonitions and proceedings the Directors of the East India Company at their Chamber in <CORR
SIC="Middelbutgh">Middelburgh</CORR> on the 18. of September 1649. made an underhand agreement with the said <IT>Iacob Per&rehy;gens</IT> for 85000. gilders upon Caution given by the said <IT>Iacob Pergens</IT> and <IT>Peter Boudaen Courten</IT> of Middelburgh Marchant to save the said Company harmeles and indempnified from <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> and others concerning the said Monie or any after claymes.</P>
<P><IT>Ionas Abeels</IT> on the 17. of May 1650. understanding of the underhand agreement at Middelburgh, summons the Directors of th' East India Com<PB
N="8">pany before the Magistrates of Amsterdam, and declares against them that they should be condemned to pay the 85000. gilders to him in right of <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> with dammages for the same untill effectuall payment.</P>
<P>Then the Directors of th' East India Company summoned <IT>Iacob Per<PB
N="8">gens</IT>, and <IT>Peter Boudaen Courten</IT> on the 13. of September 1650. to indem<PB
N="8">pnify them from <IT>Sr. Paul Pindar</IT> for the said money, and free them of all Costs accordingly, as by the Acts of the Court appears. In the same Year 1650. <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> dyed, and soon after <IT>Ionas Abeels</IT> dyed also. So the right of Action remained in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">statu quo</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>In the Year 1654. <IT>William Toomes</IT>, Executor of <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT>, and se&rehy;verall of the Proprietors and Adventurors, exhibited their claym for the Originall loss and Dammages of 85000 Pound Sterling, before the English and Dutch Commissioners at London, appointed by the Treaty made be&rehy;tween <IT>Oliver Cromwel</IT> and the States Generall, which by a provisoe in the said Treaty was referred to the Protestant Cantons of Switserland, if the said Commissioners did not compose the same within three moneths.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Proprietors and Adventurors applyed themselves to Mr. Secretary <IT>Thurloe</IT>, for a Commission to be directed to the Protestant Can&rehy;tons, who answered that most of the Proprietors being Delinquents by Act of Parlement, for adhering to the late King, and soe they had for&rehy;feited their Estates, they could not expect any protection from his High&rehy;ness <IT>Oliver Cromwel</IT>, therefore perswaded them to desist from any fur&rehy;ther Prosecution <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">pro tempore</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>In the Year 1660. upon His Majesty's most happy restauration, severall of the Proprietors and Adventurors on the behalf of themselves, and the rest of the Interessed made their address to <IT>Sir Edward Nicholas</IT>, Principall Secretary of State, to move His Majesty to recommend their case con&rehy;cerning the Ships <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadvantura</IT> to the States Generall for satisfaction and reparation.</P>
<P>Whereupon <IT>Sir Edward Nicholas</IT> having informed the King the true state of the case, and also intimated to His Majesty what great services and sufferings <IT>Sir William Courten</IT> and <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> had undergone for the Crown of England, both in the time of King <IT>Iames</IT> and the late King, as also of the particular sufferings of <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>, and severall of the other Proprietors, His Majesty was gratiously pleased to direct his Letter under his sign Manuall to the States Generall, signifying that the said spoils and dammages being committed against the Laws of common Amity, upon his Subjects who had merited so much from the Crown, he Earnestly required the States Generall to make satisfaction to the Persons interessed <PB
N="9">and injured, according to the proofs made in his high Court of Admiral&rehy;lity, signifying also that he was obliged in Justice and Honour to see it effected accordingly.</P>
<P>In persuance of which Letter and severall Orders of the Councell-Table for Instructions to <IT>Sir George Downing</IT>, who was then Envoy&eacute; Extraor&rehy;dinary for His Majesty at the Hague, divers Memorialls, Answers and Re&rehy;plyes passed between him and the States Generall in the Year 1662. con&rehy;cerning the said spoils and Dammages of those Ships <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT>, wherein the States Generall denyed not the matter of fact, but would have Evaded any other satisfaction to the proprietors and Participants, then what the East India Company by Combination had given to <IT>Iacob Pergens</IT> upon his fraudulent practise as aforesaid.</P>
<P>In that Year 1662. the States Generall having instructed <IT>Mr. Simon van Hoorn</IT> and <IT>Mr. Michiel van Gogh</IT> their Ambassadours in England, to get the said spoiles and depredations concerning the said Shipps to be morti&rehy;fied and Extinguished in the Treaty then depending at Whitehall, his Majestie declared he would breake of the said treatie unlesse satisfaction and reparation should be made for the said Shipps according to the said Letter of recommendation to the States Generall at the Hague as afore&rehy;said.</P>
<P>Where upon there was a particular Exception in the 15. Article of the said Treaty, concluded at Whitehall the 4. of September 1662. that the Dammages concerning those two Shipps <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonad&rehy;ventura</IT> should not be comprehended in the Extinguishment and mortification of former losses and Injuries in the East Indies, but reserved for reparation according <CORR
SIC="tot">to</CORR> his Majesties Letters of Recommendation as afore&rehy;said, and Expressed in these words <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">poterint litem inceptam prosequi &amp;c.</FOREIGN></IT> which agreement was also attested under the Hands and Seales of the late <IT>Duke of Albermarle</IT>, the <IT>Earle of Manchester</IT>, the <IT>Lord Hollis</IT>, the <IT>Lord Bartlet, Sir George Carteret, Sir Edward Nicholas</IT> and <IT>Sir William Morice</IT>, Commissioners that Treated with the States Embassadours.</P>
<P>In the Year following <IT>Sir George Downing</IT> in persuance of the said Trea&rehy;ty, held a Conference with the Pentionaris <IT>Iohn de Wit</IT> and the Deputies of the States Generall, in the presence of <IT>Mr. Peter van Dam</IT>, and two of the Directors of the East India Company in the Chamber of the States Generall to adjust the said Dammages, But in stead therof the Company made severall impertinent interpretations upon the Law of England in the Case of <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT> and <IT>Sir Edward Littleton</IT>; Notwithstanding the said Company had the Opinions by them under the hands of <IT>Sir <CORR
SIC="Iohnn">Iohn</CORR> <PB N="10">Glynn, Sir Iohn Maynard, Sir Edward Turnor</IT> and Master Serjeant <IT>Bald&rehy;wynn</IT>, affirming that <IT>William Courten</IT> had nothing in him to grant to <IT>Iacob Pergens</IT> after the Bills of Sale to <IT>Littleton</IT> and <IT>Pindar</IT>, which made them absolute proprietors by the Law of England. Only there was a possibillity left in <IT>Courten</IT> to call them to Accompt after their debt should be paid, which opinions were also confirmed by <IT>Sir Giles Sweit, Sir William Tur&rehy;ner, Sir VValter VValker</IT>, and <IT>Sir Tymothy Baldwyn</IT>, Doctors of the Civill Laws, and delivered to <IT>Mr. Peter van Dam</IT> the Advocate of the East India Company.</P>
<P>Then <IT>Iohn de VVit</IT> offred 30000. pound sterling. upon Accompt of all the Proprietors and persons interessed, reserving the Civil right of Ac&rehy;tion against <IT>Iacob Pergens</IT> and <IT>Peter Boudaen Courten</IT>, for the 85000. gil&rehy;ders paid upon their caution as aforesaid, which offer was not satisfacto&rehy;ry, so the Generall dispute remayned also <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in statu quo</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>Afterwards <IT>Sir George Downing</IT> did by his last Memoriall upon that sub&rehy;ject, dated the 24. of October 1664. give the States Generall a peremp&rehy;tory day to make of that business, intimating therein how ill the King re&rehy;sented it to be so slighted, and that his Majestie would not prostitute his Honour any further but Governe himselfe accordingly, yet all proved ineffectuall.</P>
<P>Then the Proprietors with others addressed themselves with a list of Dammages to the House of Commons in Parliament, the <IT>Bona Esperan&rehy;za</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT> being placed in the front of all demands; whereupon the Commons voted to assist his Majestie with their lives and fortunes in acquiring satisfaction and reparation, and soone after a decla&rehy;ration for Generall Reprisalls was ordered by the King and Councell a&rehy;gainst the States Generall and their Subjects, whereupon severall mil&rehy;lions of pounds Sterling were granted to his Majestie in Parliament for the prosecution thereof.</P>
<P>In the Year following the Earle of Shrewsbury, <IT>Sir Iohn VVolstenholme, Sir Iohn Ayton, George Carew</IT> and <IT>VVilliam Floyd</IT> Esquires, and others In&rehy;teressed, made application to his Majestie by petition for Espetiall Letters of Reprisall to remaine in force against the States Generall and their Sub&rehy;jects, untill the Originall losse and dammages should be reprised which was referred to the Judge of the Admirallity and his Majesties Advocates Generall, and severall other Doctors of the Civill Law, to Examine the whole matter and to reporte their opinion what was fitt for his Majestie to do further for his Subjects reliefe in that Case.</P>
<P>After severall Consultations and debates had betweene the said refer<PB
N="11">rees Concerning the premises, <IT>Doctor Exton</IT> then Judge of the Admiral&rehy;lity Court, <IT>Sir Robert VViseman, Sir VVilliam Turner</IT>, and <IT>Sir Timothy Baldwyn</IT>, made their report to his Majestie, that in this case of spoiles the&rehy;re was no remedie left but Especiall Reprisalls to continue in force against the States Generall and their Subjects, untill the debt and Dammages (wich they found upon proofes to arise unto the summe of 151612. pound sterling) should be recovered with Costs, or a Composition made for the same betweene the East India Company of the Netherlands and the parties Interessed, whereof the said Company were obliged by the Law of Nations to take notice of.</P>
<P>In persuance thereof Letters Patents under the Great Seale of England dated the 19. of May 1665. were granted unto <IT>Sir Edmond Turnor</IT>, and <IT>Mr. George Carew</IT> (Administrator of <IT>Sir Paul Pindar</IT>) their Executors Administrators and Assignes on behalfe of them selves and all the Interes&rehy;sed to continue in force accordingly, with this Especiall clause and Provi&rehy;soe therein contained, that notwithstanding it should happen that a peace and agreement should be made betweene his Majestie and the States Ge&rehy;nerall for the Generall Reprisalls, yet it should be lawfull for the said <IT>Tur&rehy;nor</IT> and <IT>Carew</IT> and their Executors and Assignes, to putt the said Letters Patents in Execution for Especiall Reprisalls from time to time untill they had recovered the said debt of 151612. pounds with all Incident Char&rehy;ges, or that the East India Company of the Netherlands should Com&rehy;pound with the Proprietors and other persons Interessed in the same.</P>
<P>In the Year 1666. <IT>Mr. Iames Boev&eacute;</IT> delivered a Copie of the said Letters Pattents to <IT>Mr. Peter van Dam</IT>, at the East India Chamber at Amsterdam, and requested him to move the said Company to compose the said debt and Dammages in an Amicable way rather then to leave it in dispute from Generation to Generation, to the prejudice of the States Generall and their Subjects.</P>
<P>In the Year 1667. during the Treaty at Breda, the States Generall ha&rehy;ving suprized the Kings Shipps at Chattam, severall of the Proprietors freinds in the Hague moved the Pentionaris <IT>Iohn de Wit</IT>, to incite the Sta&rehy;tes of Holland and the East India Company <CORR
SIC="te">to</CORR> give some Honorable satis&rehy;faction for the <IT>Shipps Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT> (which had bin so solemnely debated in former Treaties) being more for the Interest of their Country then to insist upon such scandalous Articles as they had framed and sent to Breda concerning the said Dammages, which could not extinguish the debt or make void the Letters Patents, to <IT>Turnor</IT> and <IT>Ca&rehy;rew</IT> any more then to disannull the 35. Article of the States Patent to the <PB
N="12">East India Company of the Netherlands, whereby they make peace and Warre with all Princes and States whatsoever at their pleasure from the Cape Bon Esperanza to the Streights of Magelanus, yet <IT>Iohn de Wit</IT> and his Complices persisted in their projects, and would not hearken to any other advice.</P>
<P>In the Year 1671. the States Generall having made severall Breaches of the Treaty at Breda, and denyed Common Justice to his Majesties Sub&rehy;jects in their ordinary Courts of Judicature in Holland and Zeland, severall of the proprietors and Interessed Persons in the said debt and Dammages, made fresh applications to his Majestie by petition, and prayed that his Majestie would please to insist upon reparation and satisfaction in an Ex&rehy;traordinary way according to the merits of their causes, and Espetially for the debt of 151612. pounds ascertained under the Greate Seale of Eng&rehy;land as aforesaid, which said petition was by order of Councell referred to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and the two principall Secreta&rehy;ries of State, who made a report to his Majestie, that the States Generall having bin refractory in severall Articles of the Treaty at Breda, his Maje&rehy;stie and his Subjects were at libertie both in justice and Equity to require full satisfaction and reparation in <IT>Mr. Courtens</IT> Case, notwithstanding the said Treaty at Breda.</P>
<P>In persuance thereof his Majestie was gratiously pleased on the 7. of Ju&rehy;ly 1672. to recommend the debt of 151612. pound with Dammages by his Letter under his signe Manuall sent by the said <IT>George Carew</IT> to his Gra&rehy;ce <IT>George Duke of Buckingham</IT>, and the Right Honorable <IT>Henry Earle of Ar&rehy;lington</IT>, his Majesties Plenipotentiaries and Embassadours Extraordinary to the French King and the States Generall then upon a Treaty at Uytrecht, commanding the said Plenipotentiaries to insist upon satisfaction accor&rehy;dingly; declaring therein his care to protect his Subjects in their Just rights as well as to assist them in the recovery thereof. But the said Treaty taking no effect, the said Plenipotentiaries removed from Uytrecht be&rehy;fore <IT>Mr. Carew</IT> arrived at Amsterdam. Then <IT>Mr. Carew</IT> returning for England in Company with <IT>Mr. John Sherland</IT> the Fiscall Generall by or&rehy;der of the States of Holland Committed them both to Prison on the 6/16. of August 1672. as Criminalls upon pretence they were Ennemies to the Country, and Charged <IT>Mr. Carew</IT> as a seditious person in seeking after Justice in the premises, and detayned them both close prisoners in the ge&rehy;vangen port, where <CORR
SIC="tbey">they</CORR> are subject to many affronts and reproaches upon
<PB N="13">every encounter and Alarum in the Countrey, and also obstructed in the Just prosecution of the debt and Dammages aforesaid, which is by an Es&rehy;peciall order of the Councell board dated at Whitehall the 2. of May 1673. recommended to the Lords Embassadours Extraordinary and Ple&rehy;nipotentiaries at Cologne, intimating therein that the case of the Adven&rehy;turors and Creditors of <IT>Sir William Courten</IT> being already fully stated should be first insisted upon in the list of all Complaints, wherefore the Letters Patents were exemplified and sent to Cologne accordingly, a true Copie thereof here after followes.

SIC="uujust">unjust</CORR> sufferings in that busi&rehy;ness, both by Our own Letters under Our sign Manuall to the States Generall of the United Provinces, and by <RO>Sir George Downing</RO> Knight and Barronet, Our Envoy Extraordinary, to whom We gave especiall command so to do, required satisfa&rehy;ction to be made according to the Rules of Justice, and the Amity and good correspondence, which We then desired to conserve with them firme and inviolable. <RO><SC>And whereas</SC></RO> after severall Addresses made to the said States Generall by Our said Envoy, and nothing granted effectuall for relief of Our said Subjects, (whom We take Ourselves in Honour and Iustice concerned to be satisfyed and repaid) We lately commanded the said <RO>Sir George Downing</RO> to intimate and signify to the said States, that We ex&rehy;pected their finall Answer, concerning satisfaction to be made for the said Ships and Goods by a time then prefixed and since elapsed, that We might so govern ourselves thereupon that Our aforesaid Subjects might be relieved according to Right and Iustice; And yet no satisfactory Answer hath been given, so that We cannot but apprehend it to be not only a fruitles endeavour, but a prosti&rehy;tuting of Our honour and dignity to make further Application, after so many denyals and slightings. <RO><SC>And whereas</SC> John Exton</RO> Doctor of Laws, Iudge of Our High Admiralty Court of <PB
N="16">England upon Our Command, to certify to Us the value, and losses, and dammages, susteyned by the said <RO>William Courten</RO> and Part&rehy;ners, whose Interest is now vested in Our loving Subjects <RO>Sir Ed&rehy;mond Turnor</RO> Knight, and <RO>George Carew</RO> Esquire, and Part&rehy;ners, hath upon full Examination and proofs thereof made by witnesses in Our High Court of Admiralty, reported and certified under his hand that the same do amount to the summe of one hun&rehy;dred fifty one thousand, six hundred and twelve Pounds.

<TEXT REND="go"><BODY><P>&Tic;O make a retrospect into all the former proceedings of this case, or to doubt the validity of the grant, af&rehy;ter all matters were brought into a solemn Act of Letters Patents under the great Seal of <RO>England</RO>; were not only to question his Majesties Soveraign Power, and Prerogative Royall in the protection of his Subjects, but to arraign the Judgements and opinions of all the Kings Ministers of State, Judges and publique Persons; that debated this business in Councells, in Treatyes, in Parliament, and inferior Courts of Judicature, before this speciall Comission was granted.
</P><P>As the King cannot be deceived in his grant, so he cannot do his Subjects any wrong, wherefore in most Pattents the Clause (<RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">quan&rehy;tum in nobis</FOREIGN></RO>) is incerted.</P>
<P>It's a maxime in Law that which belongs to another Man can&rehy;not be taken from him without his own consent.</P>
<P>In the Year <RO>1639. Sir William Boswell</RO> gave a Memoriall to the States Generall in the Kings name to have satisfaction and repa&rehy;ration for the spoils and Dammages done in the East Indies to his Majesties Subjects. And another Memoriall was given at the same time to that purpose in England, unto <RO>Mr. Albertus Joachymy</RO> the States Ambassador then Resident in ordinary there, unto both which Answers was given, that then could not treate with the King for the Damages done to the East India Company of Eng&rehy;land, who might question them for the same herafter, so the mat&rehy;ter rested <RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in statu quo</FOREIGN></RO>.</P>
<P>This Pattent was not made underhand as <RO>Mr. Pergens</RO> (who had no right) made the agreement with the East India Company <PB
N="21">of the Netherlands. Neither was the Company ignorant of the precedent grants to <RO>Sir Edward Littleton</RO> and <RO>Sr. Paul Pindar</RO> before they treated with <RO>Mr. Pergens</RO> any more then they were of this Pa&rehy;tent when they treated at Breda. Yet they had the confidence by advice of <RO>Iohn de Wit</RO> to frame their Articles rencounter to the Lawes of God and nature, impertinently using the words of morti&rehy;fying, obliterating, extinguishing, and disannulling all offen&rehy;ces, dammages, losses and injuries whatsoever sustained by the Subjects of either side, at any time whatsoever before that treaty: And that all actions, pretentions, and grants whatsoever for the same should be voyde, and for ever renounced, and revoaked, giveing every man liberty to take advantages of his owne wron&rehy;ge, which treaty was soone cancelled by new breaches, and his Majestie lest at liberty as if the treaty at <RO>Breda</RO> had never bin made.</P>
<P>What is repugnant to reason and Justice is voyde in it selfe, as (<RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">felo de se</FOREIGN></RO>) and distructive to all Civill Society and being. <RO>Iohn de VVit</RO> and his Brother were the first that used the words mortifi&rehy;cation and extinguishment in any Treaty of State, which God himselfe abhors in such cases, having decreed that the offendor shall restore three fould for what is wrongfully taken, which im&rehy;plyes the dammages sustained for want of that which was taken away from the Persons injured.</P>
<P>Those, two <RO>Wits</RO> were mortified and extinguished not only for u&rehy;sing such Arrogant expressions, but as a just reward to such Per&rehy;sons that indeavored to add force to violence, and fraude to oppres&rehy;sion, and treachery to both.</P>
<P>No man will deny but that the King of <RO>Great Brittain</RO> in diverse cases may suspend the Execution of Law in his own Kingdoms, but in no case can give or take away any mans right without a com&rehy;pensation.</P>
<P>The Hollanders have a great power beyond the Cape <RO>Bon Espe&rehy;rance</RO>; and have lately had the boldness to affront his Majesty in his own Seas, but to strike at the Laws and Customs of England, threatnes not only his Majesties prerogative, but shakes the very foundation and common Interest of every individuall Subject, which is nearer and dearer to them then their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P REND="it">&Iic;T's necessary now to shew what Presidents there are in former Treatyes, between the Belgick Provinces and the Crown of <RO>England</RO>, concerning <PB
N="22">spoyls, dammages and losses before the seaven United Provinces were a Common-wealth; and since they have been made a Republique.
</P><P>In the xxix. Article of the Treaty made between King <RO>Henry</RO> the seaventh, and <RO>Philip</RO> Duke of <RO>Austria</RO> and <RO>Burgundy</RO> concluded at <RO>London</RO> the <RO>24.</RO> of February <RO>1495.</RO> it was agreed that all and singular Letters of Reprisall marke and countermarke which were granted by the said Princes or their Predecessors, either out of their high Courts of Chancery or other inferior Courts should be held in suspension without further Execution to be done thereupon <RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">nisi super earum meritis habita cognitione indicta, ad hoc per ipsos Principis specialiter deputandum, alitur fuerit ordinatum</FOREIGN></RO>. So that there was no mortification or <CORR
SIC="extiuguishment">extinguishment</CORR> of the right, only a suspension of the execution, but yet if there were spetiall matter in the merits of the cause made knowne to the Princes respectively they ordered it otherwise untill satisfaction was given to the parties greeved:</P>
<P REND="it">&Aic;Nd if either of those Princes had had the like occasion given as his Ma&rehy;jesty (in this case) they would have entayled a Commission to Eternity if reparation were not found, or the matter composed.
</P><P><RO>Charles</RO> the first (of that name) <RO>King of Great Brittain</RO>, granted a speciall Commission for Reprisall, under the Great Seal of Eng&rehy;land, unto <RO>Mr. Pawlet</RO> on the behalfe of himselfe and other Mar&rehy;chants of London who had sustained losses by the Spanjards to the value of <RO>30000.</RO> pounds Sterling in time of Peace; which Commission was to continue untill satisfaction of the debt and Dammages: And at the Treaty concluded betweene the King of Spaine and the King of England at Madrid in the Year <RO>1630.</RO> Ca&rehy;re was taken by the Spagniards to satisfie the remainder of the debt not recovered by reprize, as appeares by the accounts stated in th' Admiralty and the recorde there of inrolled in the Chancery.</P>
<P>In the xxx. Article of <RO>Oliver Cromwels</RO> Treaty concluded with the States Generall in the Yeare <RO>1654.</RO> which was made in confor&rehy;mity to the Treaty with the Archduke of Austria aforesaid. It was agreed that at the delivery of the Ratefication of the said Treaty foure Commissioners should be nominated on both sides to meete at London the <RO>10.</RO> May <RO>1654.</RO> to examine and determine all diffe&rehy;rences and injuries committed from the Year <RO>1611.</RO> to the <RO>18.</RO> of May <RO>1652.</RO> as well in the East Indies, as in Greenland, <CORR
SIC="Mus&rehy;oovia">Mus&rehy;covia</CORR>, and Brazill, or in any other place. All the said particulars <PB
N="23">of losses to be delivered in writing to the said Commissioners before the <RO>18.</RO> of May and none after. And that what shall not be con&rehy;cluded within three moneths by the said Commissioners shall be re&rehy;ferred to the Protestant Cantons of Switzerland which were to be Arbitrators and to <CORR
SIC="conclnde">conclude</CORR> the business within six moneths follo&rehy;wing, the forme of an instrument <CORR
SIC="bein">being</CORR> agreed upon for that purpo&rehy;se: Nevertheless there was only <RO>80000.</RO> pound Sterling paid to th' East India Company of England for the spoyles and Damma&rehy;ges at Amboyna and <RO>3650.</RO> Pounds to the widdows and Orphants of the English Factors murthered there.</P>
<P>And in the xxij. Article of the Pyrenean Treaty concluded be&rehy;tween <RO>France</RO> and <RO>Spain</RO> on the <RO>7.</RO> of November <RO>1659.</RO> it was a&rehy;greed that all debts and Dammages contracted before the warre which upon the said day of the Publication of this Treaty shall be found not to have bin actually paid unto others by vertue of Jud&rehy;gements given upon Letters of confiscation or Reprisall <SIC>shalbe</SIC> <RO><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">bona fide</FOREIGN></RO> satisfied and paid. And upon the demands and persuites that shall be about them, the said Lords and Kings shall give or&rehy;der unto their Officers to render as good and speedy <CORR
SIC="Jnstice">Justice</CORR> unto the Forraigners as unto their owne Subjects without any distinc&rehy;tions of Persons.</P>
<P>By all which it appears there was no such words Mortification or extinguishment used, or others to barr any mans right of action for any things done or committed before the warre.</P>
<P>In the xb. Article concluded at Whitehall between the <RO>King of Great Brittain</RO> and the <RO>States Generall</RO> on the <RO>4.</RO> of September <RO>1662. John de Wit</RO> and his Faction, insisted and indeavored to have all the Dammages, Spoyles, and depredations in th' East Indies mortified and extinguished to that day, Argueing that the Treaty with <RO>Oliver Cromwel</RO> and the Treaty betweene <RO>Sir George Downing</RO> and the East India Company at the Hage in the Year <RO>1659.</RO> whereby they paid the further summe of <RO>50000.</RO> pounds ster&rehy;ling for the Shipps the <RO>Pellican</RO>, the <RO>Fredrick, Francis & John</RO> taken from English Marchants since <RO>Olivers</RO> Treaty should excuse them for the Dammages they had done to <RO>Courten</RO> and his Partners <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Anno</FOREIGN> <RO>1643.</RO> yet nevertheless a particular exception and provision was made in the said 15. Article, that satisfaction should be given for the Ships <RO>Bona Esperanza</RO> and <RO>Henry Bonadventura</RO>, according to his Majesties speciall recommendation as aforesaid, being a di<PB
N="24">stinct matter from all other spoyles and depredations committed by th' East India Company of the Netherlands.</P>
<P>In persuance whereof the two following Yeares being spent in fresh applications and addresses to the States Generall, the States of Holland, the Directors of th' East <CORR
SIC="Iudia">India</CORR> Company and to severall Participants without effect.</P>
<P>All Circumstances then considered there was one stepp further made in this speciall case, more then was in the <RO>Amboyna</RO> business to intayle the clayme by Letters Patents for a perpetuall Reprisall untill satisfaction and reparation should be recovered for the debt and Dammages sustained, which if it had not bin granted his <RO>Ma&rehy;jesty</RO> had lessened his owne honor and greatnes, as well as his po&rehy;wer and prerogative for the protection of his Subjects in their Just right, as also in assisting them in recoverie of the same.</P>
<P REND="ro">From whence this Conclusion naturally follows the premises, that there is no Appeale, Manifesto, Treaty Guifte, or reward whatsoever, or any other way or meanes under Heaven to <CORR
SIC="mor&rehy;fie">mortifie</CORR>, extinguish and discharge the debt and Dammages concerning the <IT>Bona Esperanza</IT> and <IT>Henry Bonadventura</IT>, but by satisfaction and reparation given to the persons interessed and injured, whe&rehy;reby a suffitient discharge may be had.
