<P>&Hic;Ow doth the Press labour (in this Scribling age) un&rehy;der the burthen which is put upon it, by every wilde and brain-sick fancy of our Republican Candidates; each of them, according to the length of that Worm which is crawling in his head, flinging in his Paper myte, though of never so base and counterfeit stuff, towards the erection of that, which is supposed in his opinion, but to look like matter of Defence, for this <IT>Utopian</IT> thing, of a <IT>Common-wealth</IT>, so much noysed and talked on amongst us, Though to sober and judicious persons, It cannot but be known, that the least blast proceeding from unbyassed, solid, and impartial truth, and prudence, scatters (as to us of this Nation) all those empty Nothings which seem to make such a fine and Gawdy shew, into meer ayr and bubble: For, let the pyth and substance of all, even the best of that matter (for some there is so frothy and full of filth that the very reading of it nauseates) that hath been said or writ on this sub&rehy;ject be pickt out, and but narrowly survey'd and considered, and what doth it all amount to, more, than what (as it relates to us) the apply&rehy;ing of one short Distinction, takes off the edge of all in it, which looks like any thing of Logick or Sense. It may surely be acknowledged, That, It is possible, a People may live happily enough, under any of the three chief forms mentioned in Story, viz. <IT>Monarchy, Aristocracy</IT>, or <IT>Democracy</IT>, so they have good Laws, and good Magistrates. The form in that case, doth not perhaps much add, or diminish; But to prefer any of the two last, before the first, is to deny that faith and experience which all good History hath taught us; And, as the case stands in this Nation, where Monarchy is more ancient than History it self, and so venerable and acceptable to the spirit and genius of the whole body of the People, of all sorts, our Laws (the absolutely best in the Christian <PB
N="2">world) being graffed into that stock, and having their birth and bree&rehy;ding under that happy Government, To attempt, or any way affect, the Desired alteration, were nought else but to Renounce and bid De&rehy;fiance to our reason and understanding. Were we a people newly Dropt from the Clouds, and now to begin the setling of a frame of Government for our selves, The best Directions, we could gather from all that hath hitherto been said, or indeed possibly can be excogitated, by the wit and invention of man, to recommend us to that, which some persons for their vile and ugly interest and ends so much hanker after, hath their whole fabrick built upon such suppositions as no rational or prudent man can possibly suppose all arguments for it; Taking for granted, That, which never was, is, or indeed can be found, amongst men clothed with corrupt Mortality: But when we are already under such a consti&rehy;tution as is premised, and which is the chief matter of the subsequent Discourse, To ravel all our Laws, Dig up such ancient Foundations, and unsettle that firm Bottom, which hath for so many ages rendred us an opulent, famous and flourishing people: It would be such a peece of folly and madness, That any Potent neighbour Prince, may surely have just cause to think that by the Law of Nations he may invade and possess our properties, upon the Title, score, and accompt of Idiotism, Lunacy, or Phrensie.
</P><P>It is possible, That some (otherwise very eminent and worthy per&rehy;sons) may by the subtilties and insinuations of others, be so far mislead, as to think very gloriously of that which is so much talked on, and so little understood, <IT>A Free State</IT>, or <IT>Common-wealth</IT>; and that the true and real essentials thereof cannot be had, and enjoyed, but in, and un&rehy;der such a popular frame and constitution as they fancy. These subtle men know well enough, that there is no easier way to cheat us out of our best condition than by the hopes of enjoying it in a better manner, and under a fuller freedome: And some of them know also, as well as the best sort of their bribed Pen-men, That there is a great and vast diffe&rehy;rence between the form of a thing, and the essence of it; The con&rehy;founding and not distinguishing whereof, in our considerations upon that subject: But being so presented, as if the one were not to be had without the other, is that, which gives them such advantage to insinu&rehy;ate their corrupt and crafty beguilings to such upon whose capacities and understandings they have hope to impose and prevail: And although their owne sinister and vitious ends therein, is so manifest and notorious, every body knowing well their inclination, temper, and disposition, and what it is, they hereby aim at, <IT>viz.</IT> Not to be in the least hazard or fear of punishment, or restitution, for whatsoever acted or rapin'd by them, during the late shakings and convulsions of the Times; for though they are or may be undoubtedly assured, of an <CORR
SIC="obsolute">absolute</CORR> and cer&rehy;tain indempnity, and a full and free injoying of what they are so fear&rehy;ful to be deprived of, yet (oh the fright and terrour of a guilty Soul!) <PB
N="3">That will not serve the turn, They cannot rest in quiet, nor injoy any calm thoughts, unless they tare up all by the roots, and utterly de&rehy;molish all footsteps of that Government and those Laws, which may in any sort continue the least of fear, hazard, or danger upon them: And whatever other fair and specious pretences are made, of a <IT>Free State</IT>, and <IT>Common-wealth</IT>, and other glorious and glossy things, to delude and captivate vulgar apprehensions; Yet their own consciences cannot but tell them, That from this currupt stem and root alone, springs all these fine, Gawdy and Republican leaves and blossomes; For this is openly manifest, That whilst some Grandees of this sort <CORR
SIC="sat tat he">sat at the</CORR> stern, al&rehy;though their discords in all other things were almost infinite, yet they still agreed in this, to destroy our fundamentals in order to complete their designs, and secure there own empty and pannick fears and je&rehy;lousies; which ingaged all sober and judicious persons, to detest their way and courses, and more firmly unite themselves, to the true loyal interest, as abhorring those violent confusions, and destracting altera&rehy;tions, amongst us, which they saw this <IT>Free state</IT> or Republick must of necessity introduce: Now, that this their fallacies, of thus con&rehy;tunding the formalities, and essentials, of a <IT>Common-wealth</IT> together; And insinuating the non-possibility, as it were, of the one to be with&rehy;out the other, may the more clearly and fully appear: Let us reflect a while upon the Government here amongst us, as it stood twenty years ago; which though truly Monarchical, yet did it by a frequent Refining of it self upon several occasions (rejecting the evil, and retaining the good of all the known best Governments in the world) raise it self to such a mirrour of perfection, That it became the envy of <IT>Monarchies</IT>, and shame of all <IT>Common-wealths</IT>, who therein might behold themselves so ecclipsed and silenced in all the pretentions to Liberty and Freedom; That it might be truly asserted of us, That with the most Choyce and signal ornaments of the Noblest Kingdomes, we injoyed all the Im&rehy;munities and Priviledges, of <IT>A Free State</IT>, and <IT>Common wealth</IT>. And although All nations have their several and peculiar Rights and Free&rehy;doms, yet none so truely free as the people of <IT>England</IT>, can they be but so happy, as to keep their fundamental Laws inviolate and unshaken.</P>
<P>The Excellency of these our Rights and Freedoms, consist princi&rehy;pally in these Particulars following,</P>
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> That we cannot be disseized or charged in our Freeholds, Fran&rehy;chises, or Goods, but by Law, or our own consent; and that in a Free and lawful Parliament, and for the publick good onely.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> There is such care taken of the Liberty and Freedom of our Per&rehy;sons, That none ought to be straitned or imprisoned but by a lawful Trial of his Peers, or the known Laws of the Land, executed by a law&rehy;ful Magistrate. The cause of the imprisonment is to be expressed in the warrant, and prosecution within a fit time to be made, or the party to <PB
N="4">be delivered by a <IT>Habeas Corpus</IT>, which the Judge cannot deny; and if an undue or illegal commitment be made, it is actionable at Law, a&rehy;gainst the Officers who are instrumental therein.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> That no Law hath force to bind, but such as by our own allowance, hath been or shall be established, by the soveraign of the Nation, or else hath been received <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ab antiquo</FOREIGN> by the constant usage of the People.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>4.</LABEL> No Judgment concludes us but such as is passed before Magistrates, of our own nation, who ought to be ordinarily called, duly authorized, and legally sworn to do us justice according to the known Laws of the Land.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>5.</LABEL> All our proceedings and Trials at Law ought to be publick, to our greatest ease, <IT>viz.</IT> in the open view of the County, Hundred, Society, or Corporation, where the cause of action is supposed to be given.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>6.</LABEL> Every particular person in matter of Crime or interest is Triable onely <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">per pares</FOREIGN>, his equals, fellows, or Neigbours, who make the said Trial upon their corporal oath, from which form of Trial, (in point of right) the Soveraign himself cannot plead exemption.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>7.</LABEL> That Justice according to Law, and that form of Trial, cannot be sold, delayed, or denyed to any person whatsoever.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>These are the chief heads of the Rights, Freedoms, and Liberties of the People of this Nation firmly setled and established, under Monarchy, which together with other particulars, collectable out of that above thirty times confirmed <IT>Magna charta</IT>, and the Petition of Right, and what were granted by the late King, in his last and never to be forgot&rehy;ten Parliament, sure such a stock of Immunity and Freedom for a people, that all the Free-states, and Common-wealths, that are, or ever were, extant, in any place throughout the whole universe, may be justly chal&rehy;lenged to shew if they can, the like Liberty and Freedom for their Ci&rehy;tizens and Subjects: We may truly say, that the Peoples Liberty walks with equal pace at least, and stands upon as firm if not firmer ground, than the Soveraigns Prerogative, nor are they esteemed less tender and sacred; For upon the least infringement, or violation of what belongs to the people, in point of Liberty and Immunity, far more loud alarms have been alwayes given to the whole Nation, Then have been taken by <CORR
SIC="Soveraigntive">Sovereignty</CORR>, when the very bowels of Prerogative have been deeply gashed, and in a manner quite torn out.</P>
<P>Some experience, we have of late years had, of a Common-wealth (as it was called) here amongst us, <IT>viz.</IT> from 1648, to 1653, and strange unknown Guardians it had set over it, and as strange and un&rehy;heard of acts of violence, and arbitrary exorbitancy; It was most free&rehy;quently guilty of, such as have cause enough to be by all remembred, and surely cannot easily be forgotten; And so, though in a very faint and stag&rehy;gering condition, it continued acting its illegal cruelties, upon all oc&rehy;casions, and that with all severity, until that fate befell it; which hap&rehy;pens to most of that sort, and kind, though of far better frame and con<PB
N="5">stitution than can possibly be ever expected amongst us, which is, that unless it can Truckle under some potent Neighbour Prince, shall be sure to be invaded by Usurpation, debauched by Oligarchy, or confounded by Anarchy: And this, how often since, it hath in this short time been our own case, it may with sadness enough be remembred by us; For how is it probable, or indeed possibly to be expected, that any Government e&rehy;rected and established by inequality and force (as ours must needs be, if we desert our old foundation) can ever subsist and fasten, without an exorbitant and all-devouring power, and force to uphold and maintain it; And on whose shoulders the burthen of that must needs lye, (the grand and standing Treasury and Revenue being exhausted, and squan&rehy;dred into private hands, and all publick Monies (or rather indeed Ra&rehy;pines) passing through the pitchy claws of such State harpies as we have already had experience of, and such or their like as cannot but be ex&rehy;pected hereafter) it is easy enough to be conjectured; In which, and manifold other respects, It is impossible to be imagined otherwise in reason, but that the little fingers of our upstart Lords and <CORR
SIC="Staes-men">States-men</CORR>, of such an empty new-rising State (be the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rota</FOREIGN>, or whymsical wheel terning or standing still) cannot possibly but prove more heavy and weighty to a tame and tired people, then the whole loyns of a Free born Heir, and of an ancient Monarchy setled as this is, whose Repu&rehy;tation, Title, and Self-sufficiency, will be <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">supersedeas</FOREIGN></IT> enough to the peo&rehy;ples discharge, of whatsoever may but look like oppression to them: And should we after all our expence, Toile, Torments of faction, and such emptying of our selves, fix and settle at length, into such a degree of possible permanency, as that we may but seem to stand a high-lone, though with the prop of an army (For that in no case must be left out) what Alarms and excitements should we presently give to all our neigh&rehy;bours, by our new upstart and strange shape? What State sol&oelig;scisme should we be guilty of, and very probable provocations to all our best Allies? And their being several Dormant accompts, in the memorials of Princes abroad, who watch but for their opportunity and advantage, can it in reason or prudence be otherwise imagined, but that in the conclusion, we must be forced to admit of theirs, or at best our own Soveraigns con&rehy;quest upon us: Besides, how will our <IT>State craftsmen</IT> fodder up the busi&rehy;ness, about those two ancient Monarchies of <IT>Scotland</IT> and <IT>Ireland</IT>: And whether they will be long contented (if at all) to Truckle under such a half, (or rather no) headed Bedsted as ours is like to be, and that without either Curtaines or Valence to it, when they may have a rich and royal Canopy, and Cloth of State of their own, That would sure&rehy;ly do well to be enquired into, and to have us assured of.</P>
<P>By what is premised, we may somewhat guesse at the cheat which would be put upon us, by those partially Byassed, and self-interessed men, who make this noyse and stir by themselves and their hyred Advocates, of all sorts, subtle, and silly, about this businesse of a Common-wealth <PB
N="6">which will be more illustrated upon farther contemplation of that hap&rehy;pinesse which we and our Ancestors have so long enjoyed, under that Celestial form of Government (<IT>Monarchy</IT>) our Lives, Liberties and Estates being under it, so well and amply secured by our Lawes, that what people was there under Heaven, that might with truth and since&rehy;rity, boast of a more flourishing and happy condition than we were in, till Ambition and Faction entred amongst us, and rent and tore in pieces, all the Gards and Seams, which linkt and bound us together, and which adorned and filled us with such beauty, health, vigor and pro&rehy;sperity, that we were become the envy and wonder of the whole Chri&rehy;stian world. And that which hath been by those rotten, and self-interessed men, so often imputed to Monarchy, and Kingship, (Tyranny) so fast and strongly tyed and chained up by our Lawes, from doing hurt or prejudice to us, in our best and deerest concerns, that we were be&rehy;come, even dainty, nice and wanton in our felicities; such a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cornu Copia</FOREIGN>, or <IT>Catholicon</IT>, of welfare, and happinesse, our Prince and Soveraignes gentle power was to us, that whilst it enjoyed its <CORR
SIC="justs">just</CORR> Rights, we re&rehy;ceived thence all the benefits of plenty, ease, and quiet, that possibly could be imagined. It was our curb to Tumults, our Moderator to Fa&rehy;ctions, our <CORR
SIC="Sanctnary">Sanctuary</CORR> for Remedies of all sorts, our assured preventer of Mischiefs, it topp'd Usurpation, administred Justice, afforded Equity, and indulged Clemency and Mercy: It was the very joy of our Hearts, and the breath of our Nostrils, and what is it but a kinde of black, hi&rehy;deous, and mischeivous Envy (had I said Blasphemy, there is good war&rehy;rant for it in Holy Writ) to despise, reject, and kick against it, and so against Heaven it selfe. Monarchy being the sole and onely Govern&rehy;ment ordained by God, and Kings and Kingdomes, his alone institution and planting, as is cleer by the whole current of Sacred Scripture, from <IT>Adam</IT> even till the Primitive Church after Christ; and Republiques, States, and such like, a meer depraved Institution of Man, for corrupt and sini&rehy;ster ends; and as it was, and is established here amongst us, so bounded by Law, and exempt from Tyranny, that it could not so much as oppresse a poor harmless Orphan. No Sheriffe, Constable, or Bailiffe, but was more terrible, powerfull, and petulant, in their severall and distinct wayes and powers, than the Soveraigne himself, and less subject to the curb, rule, and guidance of Law, in most of their actions and admini&rehy;strations: He neither made Lawes in his personall capacity, neither did he execute or interpret them. No Judge stood in awe of his single command, to justifie the least trespass. Nothing was more true than that great and general Maxime, <IT>That the King could do no wrong</IT>; for in the <CORR
SIC="cose">case</CORR> of any wrong done, the presumption of Law was, That he did it not, but his Officers or Agents were accomptable, and responsal to the Law for it; his Power was so limited by his Justice, that his dis&rehy;pleasure could streighten no mans liberty, but the Law would relieve him by a <IT>Habeas Corpus</IT>, which the Judge durst not deny. And yet this <PB
N="7">Innocuous, meek and gentle Authority, for the vile, base, and corrupt ends, of some bloody, covetous, and ambitious persons, must be branded with the odious name of Tyranny, and all the filth that can be cast up from their Rankerous Lungs must be flung upon it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, a Negative voice the Soveraigne had in the passing of Laws, but what (upon due consideration) did it signifie, but a meer weapon of defence, to shield the Government from being prostituted to altera&rehy;tion, at the will and pleasure of inferiority. And doth not late times tell us, there was a just necessity for it? and was there not such an e&rehy;quivalent awe and power in the People for this Negative voice, that as they could pass no Law without him, so could not he without them? besides, was not the publick purse in their hands, and dispose, to engage him to pass what they had a minde to? Were not all the Officers, and Ministers of State, and others, appointed by him, accomptable to Par&rehy;liaments, and to the Laws? or was it in his power to save any of them, or yeild him the least skreen, shelter or protection, in case they stood obnoxious. The Militia and Nations Sword he wore indeed, for decency sake only, but could not draw it for the oppression of the People, but by their own consents, he having no mercenary Redcoats at his com&rehy;mand; but the Armes of the Nation were in the hands of men of Estate and interest, the Officers being Gentlemen commonly of the better sort and quality, and the Soldier a Yeomen or Farmer at least. All of them such, as cannot in reason be conceived to joyne against Law, with the Lust and Ambition (could such a thing possibly be) of any single per&rehy;son of what quality soever, to abridge and destroy any just Freedome, they enjoyed as their Birth-right.</P>
<P>This was the state and condition of the Militia, and Armes and Force of the Nation, in those happy dayes of exercised Monarchy amongst us, which right or wrong, be the truth what it will, and never so manifest and notoriously known to be so, yet must, and shall by some, be still called Tyrannical; whereas ever since these blessed Halcion times, how have we found the case to be altered in that, and all other particulars, since this Rumble of a Free State, and Common-wealth hath brolled in our heads, especially when Fanatick Saintship and profession came in to bear sway amongst us? And the Good old Cause-mongers brought in their Canting Tones, and Phrases, which, like Gipsies, they used to know one anothers mindes by, whilst they munged the peoples Noses, and publiquely pickt their pockets. What strange and unheard of violen&rehy;ces, and outrages have our eyes beheld committed by those, who under such bare our Armes, and were paid for it by us, and in stead of protecti&rehy;on and defence to us, as in the dayes of our Monarchy duly exercised? what awe, dread and terror, did such keep the whole Nation under, from the highest to the lowest, of all sorts and qualities?</P>
<P>But why is that mentioned, which is in a manner the least of perver&rehy;sions, and a kind of a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="SPA">Peccadillo</FOREIGN>, to those many other grand and piacu<PB
N="8">lar Crimes and Offences, Rapines, Murthers, hideous and unparallel'd oppressions of <CORR
SIC="all all">all</CORR> sorts and kinds, which have been our lot and por&rehy;tion ever since we were made so unhappy, as to be deprived of our old Government, and Royal Race of Governours, and became slaves and bondmen to a generation of such State Empericks, pretending cure and healing to those wounds, which themselves (for cursed ambitious ends) had made; As that certainly none then we, have more rightly imitated the Dog in the fable, That have lost the substance of an opulent flou&rehy;rishing and happy Free State and <CORR
SIC="Comm-wealth">Common-wealth</CORR>, which really and in&rehy;deed we injoyed in all its essentials, and perfections, and caught, and embraced onely, an empty shadow, and sound of one in our ears (which (whatever may be pretended) is all we are ever like to enjoy, under any Government but our old one) when our Estates, Liberties, Bodies, Lives; nay, our very Souls have been, Torn, <CORR
SIC="Herassed">Harrassed</CORR>, Oppressed, Bu&rehy;chered, and Tortured, under the several vicissitudes, of all the most Tyrannical insolent and boundless powers of unlimited arbitrary usur&rehy;pation, that ever shewed themselves in any age or place, amongst the Sons of Christian men: And which are yet by these men (who and what sort and principles they are of, is manifest enough) laboured and endevoured to be continued amongst us, under the same spetious Title, Name, and Shew of a Free State and Common-wealth, whose shadow must still upon all occasions be freshly assumed, though the substance, Themselves know we have already in the best manner and most absolute perfection, anciently and firmly setled and established amongst us, by our Laws: But should they as formerly be in any sort returning upon us, in what shape soever (for let the outside be what it will, it is very well known what lies within, and what fruits and effects must needs be thence produced) It is hoped almighty God will so unite and animate the Nation with such a noble publick spirit, That our ancient and known fundamental Laws, and in them, the peace, quiet welfare, and happiness of our Countrey, may (next our duty to him) find the chiefest place in our hearts and minds, and arm us with a constant re&rehy;solution and undaunted zeal and courage, to use all just and lawful means, that this Divine Providence shall hold forth and season to our hands, for theirs and in them our self preservation, that we may shew, we have derived from our progenitors a true English Gallantry, defying all Hazards and Dangers in discharge of our Duties to God, our Laws, and our Countrey: Nor can any man be justly esteemed worthy, the in&rehy;heritance of his fathers Honours, Immunities, and Freedoms, who dares not convey them through all Difficulties and Dangers, to succeeding generations.</P>
<P>And that this resolution may be firmly fixed upon the spirits of those now in place and power. It is also hoped, that it will not by them be deemed nought and unseasonable to hint to them this <IT>Memorandum</IT>, or Quere, whether from the first beginning of that great contest, which hap<PB
N="9">ned between the late King and his Opposers; There was not any thing more chiefly and principally all along insisted upon, by both parties, than the upholding and maintaining the ancient known and fundamental laws of the Land? Was not the pretended violation and infringement of them, urged against those two great <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="HEB">Zanzummines</FOREIGN> of Church and <CORR SIC="Ssate">State</CORR>, the Arch-bishop of <IT>Canterbury</IT>, and the Earl of <IT>Strafford</IT>; And urges so far, as that their lives were layed down and sacrificed, for those laws, maintenance, and preservation; and hath not the swerving and devia&rehy;ting from those Laws, let in all those floods and torrents of Rapine, Misery, and Calamity, with which such an inundation have so long overspread <CORR
SIC="the the">the</CORR> face of this our Isle, and its dominions, and every where fill'd the same with horror and confusion; And is not this so cleer&rehy;ly manifest, and notoriously known, that the light it self that dayly shines amongst us, may by mortal power be sooner totally extinguished, than that undoubted truth; Nay, hath not this truth been often hinted and remembred by themselves, as may be seen in their printed publish&rehy;ments by way of vindication of themselves, concerning their <CORR
SIC="seclesion">seclusion</CORR> from the place and authority they are now in, with a cry and clamour to those then in power, to heal the sores and wasting divisions of the Nation, by a Reinduction of the known ancient and fundamental Laws thereof; and are not these things, and much more to this purpose, which may be truly asserted, but of yesterday, as it were, and very fresh and recent in the minds and memories of all men? how then may or can it any way be answered to God, our Saviour, and the world, by those now in authority, if after all this, and so sad and lamentable an experience made, and the care of all our doleful maladies, so cleerly apparent, to be ob&rehy;tained by no other, or better remedy, than by a continuance of the firm establishing of those Laws; And that remedy be plain and easie to be layed hold on, should they at such a time as this, be terrified, or upon any pretence whatsoever, be so far seduced, as to delay and neg&rehy;lect the same, or to put any bars or shackles upon the freedome, liberties, and birthrights of the people, so, or in that manner, as the same may be any way hindered or impeded; Nay, themselves also being cryed out too, and clamoured on, for this, by the general and universal vote, and earnest desire, of the whole body of the Nations, of all sorts, conditions, and qualities; And whatsoever the Interest be which seems to oppose it, as it is sinister, corrupt, and vitious, in its first being and origination, so is it odious and sacrilegious to God, and vile and contemptible, even in the eyes of the world, which it so much looks upon and respects; and however some of that Interest (for there are two sorts of them, one far more moderate, peaceful, and modest, than the other) would have the same thought to be of that bulk and magnitude, as thence to raise a con&rehy;sideration, in its favour, that may keep the wound still open, and the <CORR
SIC="gederal">general</CORR> peace either altogether unsetled, or done Republicanly, and so slightly infirmly, and not lastingly, so as that there may be still hopes <PB
N="10">left for them, of new booty and prey to be further obtained, and added to their former heap of spoils and devourings; Yet upon due search made, It will undoubtedly be found, that such of that Interest, who are thus minded, and so far intoxicated with its poyson, as to desire a new foun&rehy;dation, for our Laws to settle on, and so labour and endevour the aboli&rehy;shing of the old, and introducing a novel frame, and constitution a&rehy;mongst us, are so thin and tenuous, and so contemptibly inconsiderable a number, and most or all of them likewise, having such deep stains upon them (to say no more) that it cannot but be thought the most deplora&rehy;ble of all miseries, and calamities, that can befal a people and nation, nay three nations, and the numerous people thereof, And a strange kind of infatuation of that Authority over them, that any such care and provi&rehy;sion should be had and taken, for such a sort, and such an Interest, That the consideration thereof, should any way obstruct and hinder, that firm and lasting settlement, which concerns so many millions of persons, of all sorts, sexes, qualities, and conditions, and which is so woven into, and concentered in our Laws, and the very vital part of them, and of all our liberties, freedoms, and happinesse, which began likewise with the first natives of this Island the <IT>Brittains</IT>, and continued amongst us, for so many centuries of years, and recieved its approbation, by so many Ages and Generations of our Fore-fathers, and Ancestors, and rendred us a famous and flourishing People and Nation throughout the whole Christian World.</P>

SIC="what ver">whatever</CORR> vain and empty jealousies and fears they have to the contrary) But upon such a just and righteous settlement, of a firm and lasting peace, the wisdom of the Nation may, and no doubt but will, find out a way and means, That not a man of them shall be a penny damnified in their purchases and acquisitions of any sort or kind whatsoever: And yet both Crown and Church have a fitting and full patrimony too; which (when it comes to that) may with as much ease be demolished to any capable understanding, as this expression thereof is here set down to be read and perused: And if this be so, as to them, which clearly and with&rehy;out all controversie may (and that without much diffculty) be done, and no mans property intrencht upon, nor the publick body of the nation at all prejudiced or damnified; And the Church controversies by a national and legal Synod convened in due form, appeased, quieted and setled, so as no truly tender Christian conscience, may at all be imposed upon: But have that due evangelical liberty, which may in any kind, by the most sacred holy Writ be allowed, (And further, it is supposed no sober Christian will desire) what should hinder if the work were once strenuously, faithfully, and impartially set upon; But that yet we might hope for so much mercy from Heaven, as that after all these tempestuous stormy violences, rending wasting and consuming divisions, doleful and deplorable miseries and calamities, which have so long, <PB
N="11">and so fiercely raved, and raged amongst us. The Almighties hand may close up all our breaches, and we enjoy the blessed and happy bene&rehy;fit, of a well established firm and lasting peace; It is likewise hoped, that there is nothing premised in this paper, which may in any kind give offence to any now in place and power, either as to matters civil, or to that worthy and noble military General, by whose power & prudence much of our miseries have bin already released, and in whom it is by most believed there is such a generous and publick Ayre, and Spirit for the good and welfare of the Church and Nation; that however the mindes of some pious, sober, and judicious persons, are much flatted and dejected by se&rehy;verall particulars, which have passed and become publick; yet he being extricated and quitted, from the poysonous intoxications, of some very viperous Spirits, and the subtle and crafty insinuations of others, who, though not altogether so bad, yet much corrupted and misled by selfeish Interest and Faction: He will, upon due deliberation, seriously set his heart and thoughts upon the furtherance and advanceing that, and that onely, which may best conduce to the firme and lasting settlement of the peace, and quiet of a <UNCLEAR>torn</UNCLEAR>, tattered, and tyred people, whom he found plunged, and weltring in their own wretched and deplorable mi&rehy;series and calamities. And as he hath had the honour to serve faithfully, the conjunct interest of his Soveraigne, and the Nation in his former imployments, so he will not be now induced to sever them upon any cause, specious shew, or pretence whatsoever: For be it what it will be, that is insisted upon, to move him to affect such a partition and se&rehy;paration (come it cloathed in what shape or colour soever it will or can come) he may rest assuredly certain, that it comes not without its speciall designe upon himselfe, which, (if not avoided) in the end will be his undoubted utter ruine and destruction; let him bring it, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ad lydium lapidem</FOREIGN>, to the true Touch-stone, either of Religion, Law, Justice, Equity or Policy, and try it by either of these, or all these together, and see, how empty, light, vaine, false, and counterfeit it will prove, in all its shews and pretences. It is known well enough, that there are some persons (and perhaps from too many of them he hath no few corrupt whi&rehy;spers) who are so fixed and rivited to a desire of accomplishing their own covetous and ambitious ends, though by meanes never so vile and ruinous to others: And are by selfe-guilt, so filled with rankour, envy and ma&rehy;lice, against that person, which by all Laws of God, Nature, and the Land, should be sacred to them; That it is verily believed, that if an Angel or Seraphin from Heaven should appear, to perswade them to their duty in that particular, they like their seat and footing so well upon earth, and are so taken with the rule and domination, which they fansie they shall enjoy, in the Utopian Free State or Common-wealth, which they have floating in their own empty brains, and have so set up their heart, hopes, and faith upon it, that even such a message from Heaven it selfe, should not prevaile upon them. These men, let him please to <PB
N="12">avoid and shun (as to their whispers and Councels) as he would some noysome and hideous poyson, and hearken to the sober deliberations of the solid, judicious, and truly (not hypocritically) pious and moderate. And indeed (next to Almighty God, and his Sacred Word) consult but his own Soul and Conscience, which he hath professed, stands cleer, and <CORR
SIC="imdartial">impartial</CORR> to all Interests and Factions, in this great businesse of the Na&rehy;tion; And let not the Publick Genius and Inclination, nay, the hearty and earnest declared desire and longing for, of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty of all sorts, and from all parts and places thereof, be despicable to him, or slighted by him; but as he professeth his endeavours, for the publick settlement, so let him (declining all private junctoes) be directed therein, by publick advertisement. It is the whole People and Nations that must be obliged, let the whole People and Nations therefore freely be heard: should they desire in point of Government, (were it now in their choice) that which were not fit for them, if they be not hearkened to, they cannot be engaged: For as no man hath wrong with his consent, so certainly none in such case can be obliged against it. The generall and publick desires of the whole Nation in this particular, is known very well, nor is it doubted, but he will make good what he hath professed, and serve their publick true interest, and not the private cor&rehy;rupt interest and ends of some few. Many Millions there be on the one side, and some petty inconsiderable number, not worth naming on the other. Generall Peace, and a firm and lasting settlement, and happinesse on the one side; Warre, and distracting confusions, and in the end, general ruine and destruction on the other. Many other particulars may be hinted to him, but as he is noble and prudent, so it is verily expected, and earnestly hoped, we shall finde answerable effects thereof every way from him, and such as shall crown him with Riches and honour in this life, and eternall joy and happinesse in that which is to come.</P>
