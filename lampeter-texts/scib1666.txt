<P>1. &Fic;Irst of the Lines or Circles, every of which are actually or intellectually di&rehy;vided into 360 equall parts called Degrees, the more principle whereof are these tenn, which make up the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sph&aelig;ra armillaris</FOREIGN>, six whereof are great circles, as be all those which divide the Globe into two equall parts, or hemi&rehy;spheres, having the same center with the Globe; And the other foure are called smaller cyrcles, because they divide the Globe into two unequall parts or segments.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The 6 great cyrcles are these</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>1. The Horizon is that broad cyrcle upon the frame, this divideth the Globe into two hemispheres, the one which we see, is allwaies above the horizon, the other which we see not is below: And on the horizon are drawn <PB
N="5">divers cyrcles, <IT>viz.</IT> of the 12 Signes, and of the dayes of the Months, and the 32 winds.</P>
<P>2. The Meridian is the brasse cyrcle which standeth at right angles to the Horizon, and in which the Globe is hanged and turned about on its poles, which are the ends or extremity of the axis of the World, and upon the Meri&rehy;dian, is another little howre cyrcle fastened, with an index moving about upon the Pole.</P>
<P>3. The Equinoctiall is drawn upon the su&rehy;perficies of the Globe, in the middest between the two Poles of the World, and the degrees thereof are numbred with 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 360.</P>
<P>4. The Ecliptick line, this cutteth the E&rehy;quinoctiall in two poynts, and is divided into 12 Signes, each containing 30 degrees, and it passeth in the middest of the Zodiac, for the Zodiac is a broad cyrcle containing 16 degrees in breadth, and is the bounder of the 7 Planets.</P>
<P>5. The Equinoctiall Colure, this cutteth the Equinoctiall at right angles, in the two poynts where the Ecliptick passeth over the same E&rehy;quinoctiall line, and so passeth through the Poles of the World.</P>
<P>6. The Solsticall Colure, this passeth through the Ecliptick where it toucheth both the Tropicks, and cutteth both the Equino&rehy;ctial and Ecliptick at right Angles, and passeth <PB
N="6">through the Poles of the World, where also it cutteth the Equinoctial Coloure at right An&rehy;gles.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The 4 lesser Cycles are</IT>,</HEAD>
<P>1. The two Tropicks, each being parallel to the Equinoctial, and about 23 degrees, and 31 from it. That which is toward the <IT>North</IT> Pole, is called the Tropick of Cancer; That which is toward the <IT>South</IT> Pole, is called the Tropick of Capricorne, and these are the bounders of the greatest Declination of the Sun.</P>
<P>2. The two Polar Cyrcles, these are so far distant fromt the Poles of the World, as the Tropicks are from the Equinoctial; That which is next the <IT>North</IT> Pole, is called the Ar&rehy;tick Polar Cyrcle, and that which is next the <IT>South</IT> Pole, is called the Antartick Polar cyrcle.
</P><P>There are moreover drawn upon this Globe divers other great Cyrcles passing by the begin&rehy;ning of the twelve Signes, cutting each other in two opposite points, and these with the Sol&rehy;stitial Coloure, divide the Globe into 12 equal parts, and these are called the Cyrcles of the Longitude of Stars.</P>
<P>Also through every point of the Meridian, there are small Cyrcles imagined to be drawn parallel to the Equinoctial, which are called <PB
N="7">the parallels of Declination of the Sunne and Stars.</P>
<P>Also the like small Cyrcles are imagined to be drawn parallel to the Horizon, and these are called Almicantars, or Cyrcles of Altitude.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The second thing noted in the Delinea&rehy;tion, is the Points to be observed on the Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>1. &Tic;He more principal are these, <IT>viz.</IT> The two Points on which the Globe is han&rehy;ged and turned about within the Brazen Meri&rehy;dian, these represent the Poles of the World, from one of which to the other, there passeth a streight line through the Center of the Globe called the Axis of the World: where Note, that the two Poles of the World are the com&rehy;mon Sections of all the Meridian Cyrcles.</P>
<P>2. The two Poles of the Ecliptick, which are the two points in which the six Cyrcles of Longitude of Stars do cross or cut each other, and is near about 23 degrees 30 minutes di&rehy;stant from the Poles of the World.</P>
<P>3. The points of Zenith and Nadir, the Zenith is that Point in the Heavens which is di&rehy;rectly over our Head, and the Nadir, is on the contrary, directly under our Feet, these two are the Poles of the Horizon, being every <PB
N="8">where 90 degrees from it, and in these two points do all the Vertical or Azimuthal cyrcles meet or cut each other.</P>
<P>4. The points of <IT>East</IT> and <IT>West, viz.</IT> The two points where the Equinoctial cutteth the Horizon; these are also Diametrically oppo&rehy;site, and are the Poles of the Meridian being every where 90 degrees from it.</P>
<P>5. The two Equinoctial points of Aries and Libra, being two points where the Ecliptick cutteth the Equinoctial, and are Diametrically opposite, the former is called the vernal Equi&rehy;noctial because the Sun coming to it, the spring beginneth; the other is called the Autumnal Equinoctial, because when the Sun cometh to it, the Autumn beginneth.</P>
<P>6. The two Solstitial points, being also dia&rehy;metrically opposite, are the two points on the Globe, where the Ecliptick toucheth the two Tropicks and the Ecliptick in their touch point, <IT>viz.</IT> in the beginning of Cancer and Capricorn, and these two are called Solstitial points, be&rehy;cause the Sunne moving in the Ecliptick, near either of them, which is in <IT>June</IT> and <IT>December</IT>, it causeth the days to stand still a while, with&rehy;out a sensible lengthning or shortning.</P>
<P>Here is to be noted, that the Horizon and Meridian Cyrcles are said to be immoveable, because they are fixed to the same place; but all other cyrcles of the Sphear are said to be <PB
N="9">movable, because they being drawn upon the Surface of the Globe or Sphere, must needs move about with it in the Diurnal motion, yet other men denominate them by the contrary names.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>The third thing observed in the Deli&rehy;neations, are the Figures drawn up&rehy;on the Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;Here hath been 48 Asterismes or Con&rehy;stellations observed of ancient time, and about them in this Globe are described cer&rehy;tain Figures, not because there are any such Fi&rehy;gures in the Heavens, but are only imagined there to give denomination to the Stars of the Firmament, and yet not to all the Stars, for they are <CORR
RESP="annotator" SIC="numerable"><!-- place="supralinear" -->innumerable</CORR>, but onely to such as are most conspicuous, and whereof use may best be made, as occasion serveth.
</P><P>There are 12 Constellations of the Zodiack, through which the Zodiack passeth, and these give Denomination to the 12 Signes of the Zo&rehy;diack, in particular these with their number of Stars.</P>

&horbar;</DIV>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>The third thing to be observed in Generall is the use of this Globe,</HEAD>
<P>Which consisteth in these three things follow&rehy;ing. <IT>viz.</IT> The knowledge of the</P>
<LIST><ITEM>1. <IT>Motions</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <IT>Division</IT>,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And Operation of the
<LABEL>3.</LABEL> <IT>Propositions</IT>.</ITEM></LIST>
<PB N="14"><P>In the first place of the motions which are also three in number, <IT>viz.</IT>
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> The <IT>Diurnall</IT> motion.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> The <IT>Proper</IT> motion.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> The <CORR SIC="Tremblimg"><IT>Trembling</IT></CORR> motion.</ITEM></LIST>
</P><P>First concerning the Motions.</P>
<P>1. The <IT>Diurnall</IT> motion is made upon the Poles of the World, once about from East to&rehy;ward the West in 24 howres, and this is also called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">motus raptus</FOREIGN>, or the motion of the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">pri&rehy;mum mobile</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>2. The second motion is called the <IT>annuall motion</IT>, and is made within the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">primum mobile</FOREIGN> upon the Poles of the Ecliptick, according to the succession of the signes, which is contrary to that of the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">primum mobile</FOREIGN>, viz.</IT> from West toward East, and this motion is called <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Motus secundus</FOREIGN></IT>, or <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Motus proprius</FOREIGN></IT>, because that every Spheare hath a motion proper to it self, As that of the Sunne &sun; finisheth once about <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">secun&rehy;dum seriem signorum</FOREIGN></IT> in the space of 12 months, which is called the Solar yeare, Also <IT>Venus</IT>, &venus;, and Mercurie &mercury;, are moved about the same way in the same time, But the Moon &moon; is moved about in one month, and the Month is of two sorts, for the time wherein the Moon &moon;, departeth from any poynt of the Zodiack and <PB
N="15">returneth to it againe, is called the periodicall Month, or month of peragration, But the time wherein the Moon departeth from the Sunne &sun;, and overtaketh him againe is called the month of Consecution, or Synodicall month.</P>
<P><NOTE RESP="compiler" PLACE="none" ANCHORED="NO">this paragraph is printed on an inserted sheet in the original; the sequence of the text on p.15 is therefore not quite clear</NOTE> 3. The third Motion is called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Motus trepida&rehy;tionis</FOREIGN>, or the trembling or tottering Motion, made by the eighth Sphere of fixed Stars, and all other inferior Orbs, from North to South, and again from South toward North, and so back and forward by the space of 24. Minutes of a degree. This is the cause of the altera&rehy;tion of the greatest declination of the Sun and other Planets. But concerning these internal Motions, more is to be found in reading of the Theoricks of the Planets.</P>
<P>Mars &mars; moveth through the Zodiack in a&rehy;bout two Solar years, and that time is called the yeare of Mars &mars;.</P>
<P>Jupiter &jupiter; is moved through the Zodiack in about 12 Solar years, and that time is cal&rehy;led the yeare of Jupiter &jupiter;.</P>
<P>Saturne &saturn; in about 30 years runneth through the Zodiack, and that time is called the yeare of Saturne &saturn;.</P>
<P>The fixed Starrs, according to <IT>Ptolomie</IT> move about the Zodiack in 36000 Solar years; But according to the <IT>Alphonsines</IT> in 49000 years; And according to <IT>Copernicus </IT> in 17000 years; But <IT>Gassendus</IT> hath it 25000 years; And this time is called the great yeare, or <IT>Platoni&rehy;call</IT> yeare.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Secondly concerning the Divisions</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>1. First it is called <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sphera recta</FOREIGN>, or a right Sphere, because in such position, the Equino&rehy;ctiall cutteth the Horizon at right sphericall angles. The properties of this sphere is to have the poles of the world ly in the horizon, and the Equinoctiall passeth through the Ze<PB
N="16">nith and Nadir; and in this sphere not only the Equinoctiall, but also both the Tropicks, and all other the Equinoctiall parallels, are di&rehy;vided into two equall parts by the right hori&rehy;zon, which causeth the dayes, and nights, at all times of the yeare to be equall, <IT>viz.</IT> 12 howres long between Sun rising and setting without alteration, to those who live under the Equinoctiall line.</P>
<P>2. Secondly it is called <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sph&aelig;ra obliqua</FOREIGN>, whereof there are so many in number as there be degrees, minutes, seconds, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> in a qua&rehy;drant, And it is called oblique, because the E&rehy;quinoctiall cutteth the horizon with an oblique angle; The properties of this sphere is to have one pole elevated above the horizon, and the other as far depressed; Also because in this sphere the Equinoctiall is divided equally by the horizon, and the parallels of the Equino&rehy;ctiall unequally, therfore the days, and the nights are equall only twice a year, <IT>viz.</IT> in the beginning of the Spring, & Autumne, at which times the Sunne passeth over the first points of Aries &aries; and Libra &libra;, but at all other times of the year, the days and nights are unequall.</P>
<P>3. It is called <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Sphera parallela</FOREIGN> or a parallel Sphere, because the Equinoctiall being the same with the Horizon, all the parallels of the Equinoctiall are <CORR
SIC="olso">also</CORR> parallell to the Horizon; In this sphere, one of the poles of the World is <PB
N="17">the Zenith, and the other is the Nadir, and in this sphere the Sun continueth above the Ho&rehy;rizon above halfe a yeare together, and again as long under the Horizon, whereby the arti&rehy;ficiall day and night are each about half a year long.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Thirdly, now follow the propositions wrought by the Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>1. To find the Suns place in the Ecliptick first find the day of the Month, upon the Hori&rehy;zon, and within upon the limb of the Horizon standeth the degree in which the Sun is, this you may apply to the Ecliptick upon the Globe.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>To find the Suns Declination</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>2. First find the Suns place in the Eclip&rehy;tick upon the Globe, and bring it to the bra&rehy;zen Meridian, and there account how many degrees it is distant from the Equinoctiall, for the declination of any point in the heavens is its Meridionall distance from the Equator.</P>
<P>The declination of any star upon the Globe, is found by bringing it to the brazen meridian and accounting as before.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>To find the right ascention of the Sunne</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>3. Move the degree of the Ecliptick where&rehy;in the Sun is to the Meridian, and note the de<PB
N="18">gree of the Equinoctiall which cometh to the Meridian with it, for the arch of the Equino&rehy;ctiall conteyned between that point and the first point of Aries &aries;, is the right ascention, that is to say, it riseth with it in a right sphere.</P>
<P>The right ascention of a starr is to be ac&rehy;counted as before, if the starr be brought to the Meridian.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Longitude as it is taken on the Celestiall Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>4. The Longitude of the Sun, is that arch of the Ecliptick which is contained between the first point of Aries, and that point of the Ecliptick wherein the Sun &sun;, is; But the Lon&rehy;gitude of a Star <ADD
PLACE="supralinear" RESP="annotator">is</ADD> that arch of the Ecliptick which is contained between the first point of Aries, and the section of the Ecliptick with a great circle drawn from the pole of the Eclip&rehy;tick through the center of the starr, being <CORR
SIC="re&rehy;coned">reckoned</CORR> according to the succession of the signes.</P>
<P><IT>Which to finde</IT>,</P>
<P>Lay one end of the Quadrant of altitude up&rehy;on the pole of the Ecliptick, and the graduated edge thereof, upon the center of the starr, and so it shall shew in the Ecliptick, the signe and degree of Longitude.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Of the Latitude as it is taken on the Celestiall Globe</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>5. It is accounted in a great cyrcle distance <PB N="19">from the Ecliptick toward either Pole thereof, therefore the Sunn, or any starr being in the Ecliptick, hath no Latitude, but the Moon &moon;, or any other Planet being not in the Dragons Head &ascnode;, or Dragons taile &descnode;, or other stars being not in the Ecliptick, are said to have Latitude so many degrees as they <ADD
PLACE="supralinear" RESP="annotator">be</ADD> distant from the Ecliptick toward either pole thereof.</P>
<P><IT>Which to finde</IT>,</P>
<P>Lay one end of the quadrant of altitude up&rehy;on the pole of the Ecliptick, and the graduated edge thereof, upon the center of the starr, then may you see how many degrees thereof are contained between the starr and the E&rehy;cliptick, and that is the Latitude thereof.</P>
<P>But if you want the quadrant of Altitude then take a pair of compasses, and setting one point in the center of the starr, extend the o&rehy;ther till in the neerest distance it touch the E&rehy;cliptick, and the compasses so opened and ap&rehy;plied to the Equinoctiall, shall shew how many degrees the Latitude is.</P>

<P>Besides these common circles there are de&rehy;scribed upon this Globe divers other circles passing through both poles of the World, these are called Meridians, or circles of Longitude; Also certain other circles parallel to the Equinocticall, called circles or parallels of <DEL

PLACE="supralinear" RESP="annotator">Latitude</ADD>; Also certain oblique circular lines passing through the centers of certain roses (so called) and these are called Rhombs, Courses, or points of the compasse.</P>
<P>On this Globe are described the known parts of the World divided into severall quar&rehy;ters, <IT>Europe, Asia, Africa</IT>, and <IT>America</IT>, to which is added the unknown land about the South Pole called <IT>Megalanica</IT>. And these quar&rehy;ters of the World are subdivided into severall Kingdoms and Provinces, as may be seen in the <IT>Geographers</IT>.</P>
<DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD>The ZONES.</HEAD>
<P>This Globe is also divided into five Zones, one is called the Torrid or burnt Zone, and this lyeth between the Tropicks, the inhabitants hereof are called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Amphiscii</FOREIGN>, because they have two contrary meridionall shadows in a year.</P>
<P>Two are called temperate, and these lye be&rehy;tween the Tropicks and the Polar circles; The inhabitants hereof are called <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Heterescii</FOREIGN>, be&rehy;cause they have their Meridionall shadow <PB

<P>The two frigid Zones, are comprehended within the polar circles; The inhabitants whereof are called <FOREIGN

<P><IT>The Inhabitants of the Terrestiall Globe, do also receive other names relating to their positions each to other</IT>.</P>
<P>The <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Antipodes</FOREIGN> are such as dwell diametri&rehy;cally opposite each to other, & have all things contrary, as seasons of the yeare, and times of the day.</P>
<P>The <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ant&oelig;ci</FOREIGN> are such as dwell so far remote from the Equinoctiall on one side, as the other dwelleth on the other side, both under the same Meridian.</P>
<P>These have some things common, and some things proper, the common, as to have their noon tides together: Proper as that the win&rehy;ter of the one, is the others Summer time, and the longest day of the one, is the shortest of the other.</P>
<P>The <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Peri&aelig;a</FOREIGN> are such as live in the same pa&rehy;rallel of Latitude toward the same Pole, and are directly opposite each to other, both ha&rehy;ving the same meridian, These have their Summers, Winters, and increase, and shortning of dayes and nights together, but the night of the one is the day of the other.</P>
</DIV><PB N="30"><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>Parallels of the Longest day</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the parallels of Latitude formerly mentioned, there are other parallels immagi&rehy;ned to be drawn upon this Globe, which are called parallels of the longest day: The first of them is to be drawn at that distance from the Equinoctiall, where the longest day of the year is 12 1/4 howres long: The second where the longest day of the yeare is 12 1/2 howres long: The third where the longest day of the year is 12 3/4 howres long, &amp;c. through places increa&rehy;sing their longest day by 1/4 of an howre, till you come to the parallel where the longest day of the yeare is 24 howres long, which is under the polar cyrcles; these being drawn each way from the Equinoctiall toward each pole, divide the Globe into unequall parts or spaces, for though they be equall in time, yet they agree not in equall distance of place, but are greater or broader neer to the Equinoctiall, and are narrower the farther they are from it.</P>
</DIV><DIV TYPE="part"><HEAD><IT>CLIMATS</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>A Climate containeth two of the parallels of the longest day, and altereth the longest day by the space of half an howre, beginning at the Equinoctiall, and are in all 24, which end under the polar circle; but the antients, for want of knowledge of the parts under the Equinoctiall made at first but seaven Climats, and called them by names, & afterwards were added two <PB
