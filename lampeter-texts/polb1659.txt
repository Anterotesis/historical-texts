<P>To his Highness, OLIVER CROMWEL.</P>
<P><IT>May it please your Highness</IT>,</P>
<P>&Hic;Ow I have spent some hours of the leisure your Highness hath bin pleased to give me, this following Paper will give your Highness an accompt. How you will please to interpret it, I cannot tell; but I can with confidence say, my intention in it is, to procure your Highness that justice no body yet does you, and to let the people see the longer they defer it, the greater injury they do both themselves and you: To your Highnes justly belongs the honour of dying for the people; and it cannot choose but be un&rehy;speakable consolation to you in the last moments of your life, to consider, with how much bene&rehy;fit to the world your are like to leave it. 'Tis then onely (my Lord) the Titles you now usurp will be truly yours, you wil then be indeed the Deliverer of your Country, and free it from a Bondage little inferiour to that from which <IT>Moyses</IT> delivered his. You will then be that true Reformer, which you would be thought. Religion shall be then restored, Liberty asserted, and Parliaments have those priviledges they have fought for. We shall then hope that other Laws will have place besides those of the Sword, and that Justice shall be otherwise desin'd then the will and pleasure of the strongest, and we shall then hope men will keep Oaths again, and not have the necessity of being false and perfidious to preserve themselves, and be like their Rulers. All this we hope from your Highness happy expiration, who are the true Father of your Countrey; for while you live, we can call nothing ours, and it is from your death that we hope for our Inheritances. Let this consideration arm and fortifie your Highnesses mind against the fears of death, and the terrours of your evil Conscience, that the good you will do by your death, will something ballance the evils of your life. And if in the black Catalogue of High Malefactors few can be found that have lived more to the affliction and disturbance of Mankind, then your Highness hath done, yet your grea&rehy;test Enemies will not deny but there are likewise as few that have expired more to the universal benefit of Mankind then your Highness is like to do. To hasten this great good, is the chief end of my writing this Paper, and if it have the effects, I hope it will, your Highness will quickly be out of the reach of mens malice, and your enemies will onely be able to wound you in your memory, which strokes you will not feel. That your Highness may be speedily in this security, is the uni&rehy;versal wishes of your grateful Countrey. This is the desires and prayers of the good & of the bad, and it may be is the only thing wherein all Sects and Factions do agree in their devotions, and is our onely common prayer. But amongst all that put in their Requests, and Supplications for your Highnesses speedy deliverance from all Earthly Troubles, none is more assiduous, nor more fervent then he, who with the rest of the Nation hath the Honour to be

<PB N="3"><BODY><P>&Iic;T is not any Ambition to be in Print, when so few spare Paper and the Presse; nor any insti&rehy;gations of private revenge or malice (though few that dare be honest now want their causes) that have prevailed with me to make my self the Authour of a Pamphlet, and to disturb that Quiet which at present I enjoy, by his Highness great favour and <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin">Cato <IT>said of</IT> Pompey, <IT>It was alike Treason in him to usurp the giving him his life, as to take it away</IT>.</NOTE> injustice. Nor am I igno&rehy;rant to how little purpose I shall imploy that time and pains, which I shall bestow upon this Paper. For to think that any reasons or perswasions of mine, or conviction of their own, shall draw men from any thing wherein they see profit or security, or to any thing wherein they fear loss, or see danger, is to have a better opinion both of my self and them, then either of us both deserve.
</P><P>Besides, the subject it self is of that nature, that I am not only to expect danger from ill men, but censure and disallowance from many that are good; for these opinions only lookt upon, not lookt in&rehy;to, (which all have not eyes for) will appear bloody and cruel; and these compellations I must ex&rehy;pect from those that have a zeal, but not according to knowledge: If therefore I had considered my self, I had spared what ever this is of pains, and not distasted so many, to please so few, as are in man&rehy;kind, (the honest and the wise.) But at such a time as this, when God is not onely exercising us with a usual and common calamity, of letting us fall into slavery that used our liberty so ill; but is plea&rehy;sed so far to blind our understandings, and to debase our spirits, as to suffer us to court our bondage, and to place it among the requests we put up to him; Indignation makes a man break that silence that prudence would perswade him to use; if not to work upon other mens minds, yet to ease his own.</P>
<P>A late Pamphlet tells us of a great design discovered against the person of his Highness, and of the Parliaments coming (for so does that Junto profane that name) to congratulate with his Highness, his happy deliverance from that wicked and bloody attempt. Besides this that they have Ordered, that God Almighty shall be mockt with a day of thanksgiving, (as I think the World is with the plot) and that the people shall give publique thanks for the publique calamity, that God is yet plea&rehy;sed to continue his Judgments upon them, and to frustrate all means that are used for their deli&rehy;verance: Certainly, none will now deny, that the English are a very thankfull people. But I think if we had read in Scripture, that the Israelites had cryed unto the Lord, not for their own deliverance, but the preservation of their Task-masters, and that they had thanked God with Solemnity that <IT>Pha&rehy;raoh</IT> was yet living, and that there was still great hopes of the daily encrease of the number of their Bricks: Though that people did so many things not onely impiously and profanely, but ridiculously and absurdly; yet certainly they did nothing we should more have wondered at, then to have found them Ceremoniously thankful to God for plagues, that were commonly so brutishly unthankful for mercies; And we should have thought that <IT>Moses</IT> had done them a great deal of wrong, if he had not suffered them to enjoy their slavery, and left them to their Tasks and Garlick.</P>
<P>I can with Justice say, my principal intention in this Paper is not to declaim against my L. <IT>Pro&rehy;tectour</IT> or his Accomplices; for were it not more to justifie others, then to accuse them, I should think their own actions did that work sufficiently, and I should not take pains to tell the world what they know before. My design is, to examine whether if there hath been such a Plott as we hear of; and that it was contrived by Mr. <IT>Sindercombe</IT> against my <IT>L. Protectour</IT>, and not by my <IT>L. Protectour</IT> against Mr. <IT>Sindercombe</IT> (which is doubtful) whether it deserves those Epithites <IT>Mr. Speaker</IT> is plea&rehy;sed to give it, of bloody, wicked, and proceeding from the Prince of darkness. I know very well how uncapable the vulgar are, considering what is extraordinary and singular in every case, and that they judge of things, and name them by their exteriour appearances, without penetrating at all into their causes or natures. And without doubt when they hear the <IT>Protectour</IT> was to be kill'd, they streight conclude a man was to be murdered, not a malefactour punished: for they think the formalities do alwayes make the things themselves, and that 'tis the Judge and the Cryer that makes the justice, and the Goal the Criminal: And therefore when they read in the Pamphlet Mr. <IT>Speaker's</IT> Speech, they certainly think he gives these Plotters their right titles; and, as readily as a High-Court of Ju&rehy;stice, they condemn them, without ever examing whether they would have killed a Magistrate, or destroyed a <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="margin"><IT>See</IT> Plutarch. <IT>the Life of</IT> Timolion, <IT>ci&rehy;ted in the Con&rehy;tinuation of this Session of Parliament justified, lately printed</IT>.</NOTE> Tyrant, over whom every man is naturally a Judge and an Executioner; and whom the laws of God, of Nature, and of Nations expose, like Beasts of prey, to be destroyed as they are met.</P>
<P>That I may be as plain as I can, I shall first make it a question, (which indeed is none) Whether my <IT>Lord Protectour</IT> be a Tyrant or not? Secondly, if he be, Whether it is lawful to do Justice up&rehy;on him without Solemnity, <IT>that is</IT>, to Kill him? Thirdly, if it be lawful, Whether it is like to prove profitable or noxious to the Common-wealth?</P>
<P>The Civil Law makes Tyrants of two sorts, <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Tyrannus sine Tytulo</FOREIGN>, and <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Tirannus Exercitio</FOREIGN></IT>. The one is called a Tyrant, because he hath no right to govern; the other, because he governs Tyranni&rehy;cally. We will very briefly discourse of them both, and see whether the <IT>Protectour</IT> may not with great Justice put in his claim to both Titles.</P>
<PB N="4"><P>We shall sufficiently demonstrate who they are that have not a right to govern, if we shew who they are that have; and what it is that makes the power just, which those that rule have over the natural liberty of other men. To Father, within their private Families nature hath given a Supreme power. Every man, sayes <IT>Aristotle</IT>, <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Pol. l.</IT> 1. C. 1.</NOTE> of Right governs his wife and children, and this power was necessa&rehy;rily exercised <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Gen.</IT> 44.24.</NOTE> every where, whilest Families lived disperst, <NOTE
N="(c)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Arist. ibid.</IT></NOTE> before the constitutions of Com&rehy;mon-wealths; and in many places it continued after, as appears by the Laws of <IT>Solon</IT>, and the most Ancient of those of <IT>Rome</IT>. And indeed as by the Laws of God <NOTE
N="(d)" PLACE="margin">1 <IT>Tim.</IT> 5.8.</NOTE> and nature, the care, defence, and support of the family lies upon every man whose it is; so by the same Law there is due unto every man from his Family a subjection and obedience, in compensation of that support. But seve&rehy;ral Families uniting themselvs together to make up one body of a Comon-wealth, and being Indepen&rehy;dent one of another, without any natural Superiority or Obligation, nothing can introduce amongst them a disparitie of Rule and Subjection, but some power that is over them; which power none can pretend to have but God and themselves. Wherefore all power which is lawfully exercised over such a Society of men, (which from the end of its institution we call a Common-wealth) must necessarily be derived either from the appointment of God Almighty, who is Supream Lord of all and every part; or from the consent of the Society it self, who have the next power to his, of disposing of their own liberty, as they shall think fit for their own good. <NOTE

N="(e)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Ex.</IT> 215.</NOTE> persons; and when he interposes not his own authority and appoints not himself who shall be his Vice-gerents and rule under him; he leaves it to none but the people themselves to make the election, whose benefit is the end of all government. Nay when he himself hath been pleased to appoint rulers for that people, which he was pleased peculiarly to own, He many times made the choice, but left the Continuation and Ratification of that choice to the people themselves. So <IT>Saul</IT> <NOTE
N="(f)" PLACE="margin">1 <IT>Sam.</IT> 10.2.</NOTE> was chosen by God, and anointed King by his Prophet, but make King by all the people at <IT>Gigal</IT>. <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin">1 <IT>Sam.</IT> 12.2</NOTE> <IT>David</IT> was anointed King <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin">1 <IT>Sam.</IT> 16.14.</NOTE> by the same Prophet, but was afterwards, after <IT>Saul's</IT> death, confirmed by the people of <IT>Juda</IT>, <NOTE
N="(c)" PLACE="margin">2 <IT>Sam.</IT> 2.4.</NOTE> and 7. years after by the Elders of <NOTE
N="(d)" PLACE="margin">2 <IT>Sam.</IT> 5.3.</NOTE> <IT>Israel</IT>, the Peoples Deputies, at <IT>Chebron</IT>. And it is observable, that though they knew that <IT>David</IT> was appointed King by God, and anointed by his Prophet, yet they likewise knew that God allowed to themselves not only his confirmation, but likewise the limitation of his power; for before his Inauguration, they made a league <NOTE
N="(e)" PLACE="margin">2 <IT>Sam.</IT> 5.3.</NOTE> with him; that is, obliged him by compact to the performance of such conditions as they thought necessary for the <CORR
SIC="secueing">securing</CORR> their Liberty. Nor is it less remarkable, that when God gives directions to his people concerning their government, he plainly leaves the Form to themselves: for he sayes not, When thou shalt have come into the Land which the Lord thy God gives thee, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Statues super te Regem</FOREIGN></IT>; But, <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Si <NOTE
N="(f)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Deut.</IT> 17.14.</NOTE> Dixeris statuam</FOREIGN></IT>. God sayes not, Thou shalt appoint a King over thee; But if thou shalt say, I will appoint; leaving it to their choice, whether they would say so or no. And it is plain in that place, that God gives the people the choice of their King, for he there instructs them whom they shall choose, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Emedium fratrum tuorum</FOREIGN></IT>, one out of the midst of thy brethren: Much more might we say, if it were a less manifest Truth that all just power of Government if founded upon these two bases, of Gods immediate command, or the Peoples consent. And therefore whosoever arrogates to himself that power, or any part of it, that cannot produce one of those two titles, is not a Ruler, but an Invader, and those that are subject to that power, are not governed, but opprest.
</P><P>This being considered, have not the People of <IT>England</IT> much reason to ask the Protector this Que&rehy;stion, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Quis constituit te virum Principem & judicem super nos</FOREIGN>? Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us? If God made thee, make it manifest to us. If the People, where did we meet to do it? Who took our Subscriptions? To whom deputed we our authority? And when and where did those De&rehy;puties make the choice? Sure these interrogations are very natural, and I believe would much trou&rehy;ble his Highness his Council, and his <IT>Junto</IT> to answer. In a word, that I may not tire my reader, (who will not want proofs for what I say, if he wants not memory) If to change the government without the peoples consent: If to dissolve their Representatives by force, and disannul their Acts: If to give the name of the Peoples Representatives to confederates of his own, that he may establish iniquity by a law: If to take away mens lives out of all course of Law, by certain Murtherers of his own appointment, whom he names <IT>A High-Court of Justice</IT>. If to decimate mens estates, and by his own power to impose upon the people what Taxes he pleases: And to maintain all by force of Arms: If I say all this does make a Tyrant, his own impudence cannot deny, but he is as compleat a one as ever hath been since there have been Societies of Men. He that hath done, and does all this, is the person for whose preservation the people of <IT>England</IT> must pray; but certainly if they do, 'tis for the same Reason that the old Woman of <IT>Syracuse</IT> prayd for the long life of the Tyrant <IT>Dionysius</IT>, lest the Devil should come next.</P>
<P>Now if instead of Gods Command, or the Peoples Consent, his Highness hath no other Title but <PB
N="5">force and fraud, which is to want all Title: And if to violate all Laws, and propose none to Rule by, but those of his own will, be to exercise Tyranny he hath usurpt, and to make his Administration conformable to his claym: Then the first Question we proposed, is a Question no longer.</P>
<P>But before we come to the second, being things are more Easily perceived and found by the de&rehy;scription of their <IT>Exteriour Accidents, and Qualities</IT>, then the defining their Essences: It will not be Amiss to see, whether his Highness hath not as well the outward Marks and Characters by which Tyrants are known, as he hath their <IT>Nature and Essential</IT> properties: Whether he hath not the Skin of the Lyon, and Tayl of the Fox, as well as he hath the Violence of the one, and Deceipt of the other. Now in this Delineation which I intend to make of a Tyrant, all the Lineaments, all the Colours, will be found so Naturally to correspond with the life, that it cannot but be doubted, whe&rehy;ther his Highness be the Original, or the Copy. Whether I have in drawing the Tyrant, repre&rehy;sented him? or in Representing him, Exprest a Tyrant. And therefore I should be suspected to deal un-sincerely with his Highness, and not to have Applyed <IT>These</IT> following Characters, but made them, I shall not give you any of my own Stamping, but such as I find in <IT>Plato, Aristotle, Tacitus</IT>, and his Highness own <IT>Evangelist, Machiavell</IT>.</P>

<P>2. Tyrants accomplish their ends much more by fraud than force. Neither vertue nor force (sayes Machiavel) <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Il. princ. c.</IT> 9.</NOTE> are so necessary to that purpose, as <FOREIGN

LANG="ITA">Aggirare Lucervelli degli huomini con Astutia, &amp;c.</FOREIGN></IT></QUOTE> With cunning plausible pretences to impose upon mens understandings, and in the end they master those that had so little wit as to rely upon their faith and integrity. 'Tis but unnecessary to say, That had not his Highness had a faculty to be fluent in his tears, and eloquent in his execrations: Had he not had spungy eyes and a supple conscience; and besides to do with a people of great faith, but little wit; his courage and the rest of his Moral vertues, with the help of his Janizaries, had never been able so far to advance him out of the reach of Justice, that we should have need to call for any other hand to remove him, but that of the Hangman.</P>
<P>3. They abase all excellent persons, and rid out of the way all that have noble minds, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Et Terr&aelig; filius extollunt</FOREIGN>; and advance Sons of the Earth. To put <IT>Aristotle</IT> into other words, they purge both Parliament and Army, till they leave few or none there, that have ei&rehy;ther honour or conscience, either wit, <IT>Interest</IT>, or Courage to oppose their designs. And in these Purgations (saith <IT>Plato</IT>) <NOTE
N="(e)" PLACE="margin"><GAP REASON="missing in original"></NOTE> Tyrants do quite contrary to Physitians; for they purge us of our humours, but Tyrants of our Spirits.</P>
<P>4. They dare suffer no Assemblies. Not so much as Horse-races.</P>
<P>5.In all places they have their Spies and Dilators, that is, they have their <IT>Broughalls</IT>, their <IT>St. Joan's</IT> (besides innumerable small spyes) to appear discontented and not to side with them; that un&rehy;der that disguise they may get trust, and make discoveries. They likewise have their Emissaries to send with forged letters. If any doubt this, let him send to Major General <IT>Brown</IT>, and he will Satisfie Him.</P>
<P>6. They Stir not without a guard, nor his Highness without his Life-guard.</P>
<P>7. They impoverish the people, that they may want the power, if they have the will, to attempt any thing against them. His Highness way is by Taxes, Excise, Decimations, &amp;c.</P>
<NOTE TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Arist. Ibid. Arist. Ibid. Id. Ibid. & Plato de Re&rehy;pub. l. 9. Id. Ibid. Arist. Ibid. Machiev. Pr. cap. 19.</IT></NOTE>
<P>8. They make war to divert and busie the people: And besides, to have a pretence to raise mo&rehy;neys, and to make new Levies, if they either distrust their old forces, or think them not sufficient. The war with <IT>Spain</IT> serveth his Highness to this purpose, and upon no other Justice was it began at first, or is still continued.</P>
<P>9. They will seem to honour and provide for good men: That is, if the Ministers will be Ortho&rehy;dox and flatter: If they will wrest and torture the Scripture to prove his Government lawful, and furnish him with Title: his Highness will likewise be then content to understand Scripture in their favour, and furnish them with Tithes.</P>
<NOTE TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Machiavel <IT>adds, And do grateful things themselves. But that I omit; for I really am un&rehy;provided of an instance for his Highness, for I have not yet heard of any good he has done himself</IT>.</NOTE>
<P>10. Things that are odious and distastfull, they make others executioners of; and when the peo&rehy;ple are discontented, they appease them with Sacrificing those Ministers they imploy: I leave it to his Highness his Major Generals <CORR
SIC="tg">to</CORR> ruminate a little upon this point.</P>
<P>11. In all things they pretend to be wonderful careful of the Publique: to give general accompts of the money they receive, which they pretend to be levied for the maintenance of the State, and the prosecuting of the War. His Highness made an excellent Comment upon this place of <IT>Aristotle</IT> in his Speech to this Parliament.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>12. All things set aside for Religious uses they set to sale; that while those things last, they may exact the less of the people. The Cavaliers would interpret this of the Dean and Chapters Lands.
</P><P>13. They pretend inspirations from God, and responses from Oracles to Authorise what they do, his Highness hath been ever an Enthusiast. And as Hugh Capet, in taking the Crown pretended to be admonisht to it in a dream by St. <IT>Vallery</IT>, and St <IT>Richard</IT>: so I believe will his Highness do the same, at the instigation of St. <IT>Henry</IT>, and St. <IT>Richard</IT> his two Sons. <NOTE

<P>14. Lastly, Above all things they pretend a love to God and Religion. This <IT>Aristotle</IT> calls <QUOTE><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Artium Tyrannicarum Potissimum</FOREIGN></QUOTE>; the surest and best of all the Arts of Tyrants, and we all know his Highness hath found it so by experience. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Histor. of Fran. Ibid. lib.</IT> 5. c. 11</NOTE> He hath found indeed that in goodness there is great gain; and that preaching and praying , well managed, will obtain other Kingdoms as well as that of Heaven.

But the truth is, were it not for our honour to be governed by one that can manage both the Spiritual and Temporal Sword, and Roman like, to have our Emperor our High Priest: We might have had preaching at a much cheaper rate, and it would have cost us but our Tythes, which now costs us all.</P>
<P>Other Marks and Rules there are mentioned by <IT>Aristotle</IT> to know Tyrants by: but they be&rehy;ing unsuitable to his Highness Actions, and impracticable by his Temper, I insist not on them. As among other things <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Pol. lib.</IT> 5. c. 11.</NOTE> <IT>Aristotle</IT> would not have a Tyrant insolent in his behaviour, nor strike people. But his Highness is naturally chollerique, and must call men Rogues, and go to Cuffs. At last he concludes he should <SIC>o</SIC> fashion his manners, as neither to be really good, nor absolutely bad, but half one, half tother. Now this half good is too great a proportion for his Highness, and much more then his temper will bear.</P>
<P>But to speak Truths more seriously, and to conclude this first Question. Certainly what ever these Characters make any man, it cannot be denied but his Highness is; and then if he be not a Tyrant, we must confess we have no definition nor description of a Tyrant left us; and may well imagine there is no such thing in Nature, and that 'tis onely a Notion and a Name. But if there be such a Beast, and we do at all believe what we see and feel; let us now enquire, according to the method we proposed, whether this be a Beast of Game that we are to give law to, or a Beast of Prey to destroy with all means are allowable and fair?</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Whether it be lawful to kill a Tyrant</IT>?</NOTE> In deciding this question Authors very much differ, as far as it concerns supream Magistrates, who degenerate into Tyrants. Some think they are to be born with as bad <NOTE

Others think they may be questioned by that supream Law of the peoples safety; and that they are an&rehy;swerable to the peoples Representatives for the breach of their Trust. But none, of sober sense, makes private persons Judges of their actions; which were indeed to subvert all Government. But on the other side, I find none, that have not been frighted or corrupted out of their Reason, that have been so great Enemies to Common, and the Liberty of Mankind; as to give any kind of Indemnity to a Usurper, who can pretend no Title, but that of being stronger; nor chal&rehy;lenge the peoples obedience upon any other obligation but that of their necessity, and fear. Such a person, as one out of all bounds of humane protection, all men make the <IT>Ishmael</IT>, <NOTE
N="(e)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Gen.</IT> 16.12.</NOTE> against whom is every mans hand, as his is against every man. To him they give no more security then <IT>Cain</IT>, his fellow murtherer and oppressour, promised to himself, to be destroyed by him that found him first.</P>
<P>The reason why a Tyrants case is particular, and why in that every man hath that vengeance given him, which in other cases is reserved to God and the Magistrate, cannot be obscure, if we rightly consider what a Tyrant is, what his crimes are, and in what state he stands with the Com&rehy;mon-wealth, and with every member of it. And certainly if we find him an enemy to all Humane Society, and a subverter of all Laws, and one that by the greatness of his villanies, secures himself against all ordinary course of Justice: we shall not at all think it strange, if then he have no be&rehy;nefit from humane society, no protection from the law; and if, in his case, Justice dispenses with her forms. We are therefore to consider that the end for which men enter into society is not barely to live, which they may do disperst, as other Animals: but to live happily; and a Life answerable to the dignity and excellency of their kind. Out of Society, this happiness is not to be had, for singly we are impotent, and defective, unable to procure those things that are either of necessity, or or&rehy;nament for our lives, and as unable to defend and keep them when they are acquired. To remedy these defects, we Associate together that what we can neither enjoy nor keep, singly, by mutual benefits and assistance, one of another, We may be able to do both. We cannot possibly accom&rehy;plish these ends, if we submit not our passions and appetites to the Laws of Reason and Justice. For <PB
N="7">the depravity of mans will makes him as unfit to live in Society, as his necessity makes him una&rehy;ble to live out of it. And if that perverseness be not regulated by Laws, mens appetites to the same things; their avarice, their lust, their ambition would quickly make Society as unsafe, or more, then Solitude it self, and we should associate onely to be nearer our misery and our ruine. That therefore by which we accomplish the ends of a Sociable life, is our subjection, and submis&rehy;sion to Laws, these are the Nerves and Sinews of every Society or Common-Wealth; Without which they must necessarily dissolve and fall asunder. And indeed (as <IT>Augustine</IT> sayes) those Socie&rehy;ties where Law and Justice is not, are not Common-wealths or Kingdoms, but <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Magna Latrocinia</FOREIGN>, Great Confederacies of Thieves and Robbers. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">De civit. Dei.</FOREIGN></IT></NOTE> Those therefore that submit to no Law, are not to be reputed in the Society of Mankind, which cannot consist without a Law. Therefore <IT>Aristotle</IT> <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Pol. lib.</IT> 3. c. 12.</NOTE> saith, Tyrannie is against the Law of Nature, that is, the Law of Humane Society, in which Hu&rehy;mane Nature is preserved. For this reason they deny a Tyrant to be <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Partem Civitatis</FOREIGN></IT>; for every part is subject to the whole; and a Citizen (says the same Author,) <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Lib.</IT> 5. c. 8</NOTE> is he who is as well ob&rehy;liged to the duty of obeying, as he is capable of the power of commanding. And indeed he does obey whilest he does command, that is, he obeys the Laws, which (says <IT>Tully</IT>) <QUOTE
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Magistratibus pr&aelig;sunt, ut Magistratus pr&aelig;sunt Populo</QUOTE>, are above the Magistrates, as the Magistrates are above the people. And therefore a Tyrant that submits to no law; but his will and lust are the law, by which he go&rehy;verns himself and others, is no Magistrate, no Citizen or member of any Society, but an Ulcer and a Disease that destroys it, and if it be rightly considered, a Common wealth by falling into a Ty&rehy;rannie absolutely looses that name, and is actually another thing: <QUOTE
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Non est civitas qu&aelig; unius est viri</QUOTE> (says <IT>Sophocles</IT>) that which is one mans, is no City. For there is no longer King and People or Parlement and People; but those names are changed (at least their natures) into Masters and Servants, Lord and Slaves: And <QUOTE

N="(c)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Defur. bel. l.</IT> 3. c. 8</NOTE> where all are Slaves, 'tis not a City but a great Family. And the truth is, we are all members of <IT>Whitehall</IT>, and when our Master pleaseth, he may send for us thither, and there bore through our Ears at the door posts. But to conclude, a Tyrant, as we have said, being no part of a Common&rehy;wealth, nor submitting to the laws of it, but making himself above all law: There is no reason he should have the protection that is due to a member of a Common-wealth, nor any defence from laws, that does acknowledge none. He is therefore in all reason to be reckoned in the num&rehy;ber of those Savage Beasts, that fall not with other into any Heard: that have no other defence but their own strength; making a prey of all thats weaker, and, by the same justice, being a prey to all thats stronger then themselvs.</P>
<P>In the next place, let it be considered, That a Tyrant making himself above all Law, and defending his injustice by a strength which no power of Magistrates is able to oppose; he becomes above all punishment, above all other justice, then that he receives from the stroak of some generous hand. And certainly, the safety of mankind were but ill provided for, if there were no kind of Justice to reach great villanies, but Tyrants should be <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Immanitate Scelerum tuti</FOREIGN>, secured by the greatness of their crimes. Our Laws would be then but Cobwebs indeed, made only to catch Flies; but not to hold Wasps or Hornets: And it might be then said of all Common-wealths, what was said of <IT>Athens</IT>; That there onely small Theeves were hanged, but the great ones were free, and condemned the rest. But he that will secure himself of all hands, must know, he secures himself from none: He that flies Justice in the Court, must expect to find it in the street: and he that goes armed against every man; arms every man against himself. <QUOTE

REND="it" LANG="LAT">utique morietur vir ille</QUOTE> Deut. 17.12.</NOTE> death to that man that would do presumptuously, and submit to no Decision of Justice. Who can reade this, and think a Tyrant ought to live? But certainly neither that, nor any other Law were to any effect, if there were no way to put it in exe&rehy;cution. But in a Tyrants Case, Process and Citation have no place; and if we will onely have Formal Remedies against him, we are sure to have none. There's small hope of Justice, where the Malefactor hath a power to condemn the Judge.</P>
<P>All remedy therefore against a Tyrant is <IT>Ebud's</IT> Dagger; without which, all our Laws were fruitless, and we helpless. This is that High Court of Justice where <IT>Moses</IT> brought the <IT>Egyptian</IT>: whither <IT>Ebud</IT> brought <IT>Eglon</IT>; <IT>Samson</IT> the <IT>Philistins; Samuel, Agag</IT>; and <IT>Jehojada</IT>, the She-Ty&rehy;rant <IT>Athaliah</IT>.</P>
<P>Let us a little consider in particular these several Examples, and see whether they may be pro&rehy;portioned to our purpose.</P>
<P>First, as to the Case of <IT>Moses</IT> and the <IT>Egyptian</IT>; <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Exod. 2.11.12</NOTE> certainly every <IT>English-man</IT> hath as much Call as <IT>Moses</IT>, and more cause then he, to slay this <IT>Egyptian</IT> that is always laying on burdens, and always smiting both our brethren and our selves. For as to his Call, he had no other that we read of, but the neccesity his brother stood in of his help. He look't on his brethrens burdens, and seeing an <IT>Egyptian</IT> smiting an <IT>Hebrew</IT>, knowing he was out of the reach of all other kind of Ju&rehy;stice, slew him.</P>
<P>Certainly this was, and is as lawful for any man to do, as it was for <IT>Moses</IT>, who was then but a private man, and had no Authority for what he did, but what the Law of Nature gives every man; to oppose Force to Force, and to make Justice where he finds none. As to the Cause of that action, we have much more to say then <IT>Moses</IT> had: He saw one <IT>Hebrew</IT> smitten, we many <IT>Eng<PB
N="10">lish</IT> men murdered; He saw his brethrens burdens, and their blows, We, our Brethrens burdens, imprisonments, and deaths. Now sure if it were lawful for <IT>Moses</IT> to kill that <IT>Egyptian</IT> that opprest one man, being there was no way to procure an ordinary course of Justice against him: It cannot be but absurd to think it unlawful to kill him <NOTE

<P>The example of <IT>Ebud</IT> shews us the natural and almost the onely remedy against a Tyrant, and the way to free an opprest people from the slavery of an insulting <IT>Moabite</IT>, 'tis done by prayers and tears, with the help of a Dagger, by <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin">Judg. c. 3. v. 11,19,20</NOTE> crying to the Lord, and the left hand of an <IT>Ebud</IT>. Devotion and action go well together; for believe it, a Tyrant is not of that kind of Devil that is to be cast out by onely Fasting and Prayer. And here the Scripture shews us what the Lord thought a fit Message to send a Tyrant from himself: A Dagger of a Cubit in his belly, and eve&rehy;ry worthy man that desires to be an <IT>Ebud</IT>, a Deliverer of his Countrey, will strive to be the Mes&rehy;senger. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">V. 15</NOTE></P>
<P>We may here likewise observe in this, and many places of <IT>Judges</IT>, that when the <IT>Israelites</IT> fell to Idolatry, which of all sins is one of the greatest; <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">V. 20.</NOTE> God Almighty to proportion the punishment and the offence, still delivered them into the hands of Tyrants; which sure is one of the greatest of all Plagues.</P>
<P>In the story of <IT>Samson</IT> 'tis manifest, that the denying him his wife, and after the burning her, and her Father, which though they were great, yet were but private injuries, he took for suffici&rehy;ent grounds to make war upon the <IT>Philistins</IT>, being himself but a private man, and not onely not assisted, but opposed by his servile Countreymen. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Judg. 15.</NOTE> He knew what the Law of Nature allowed him; where other Laws have no place, and thought it a sufficient Justification for smiting the <IT>Phili&rehy;stins</IT> hip and thigh, to answer for himself, that as they did unto him, so had he done unto them. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">V. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now that which was lawful for <IT>Samson</IT> to do against many Oppressours, why is it unlawful for us to do against one? Are our injuries less? Our Friends and Relations are daily murdered before our faces. Have we other ways for reparation? Let them be named, and I am silenc'd. But if we have none, the Fire-brand, or the Jaw-bone, the first Weapons, our just Fury can lay hold on, may certainly be lawfully employed against that uncircumcised <IT>Philistin</IT> that oppresses us. We have too the opposition and discouragements that <IT>Samson</IT> had, and therefore have the more need of his courage and resolution. As he had the men of <IT>Judah</IT>, so we have the men of <IT>Levi</IT>, crying to us out of the Pulpit, as from the top of the Rock <IT>Etam</IT>, Know you not that the Phili&rehy;stin is a Ruler over you? <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">V. 14.</NOTE> The truth is, they would fain make him so, and bind us with <IT>Samson</IT> in new Cords; but we hope they become as Flax, and that they will either loose from our hands, or we shall have the Courage to cut them.</P>
<P>Upon the same grounds of Retaliation did <IT>Samuel</IT> do justice with his own hand upon the Ty&rehy;rant <IT>Agag</IT>. As thy Sword (says the Prophet) hath made women childless, so shall thy Mother be childless amongst women; nor is there any Law more natural and more just. <NOTE

<P>I should think now I had said much more then enough to the second question, and should come to the third and last I proposed in my Method; but I meet with two Objections lying in my way: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">2 <IT>Chron.</IT> 23.17.</NOTE> <NOTE
TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Object.</IT> 1.</NOTE> The first is, That these examples out of Scripture, are of men that were inspired of God, and that therefore they had that Call and Authority for their Actions, which we cannot pretend to, so that it would be unsafe for us to draw their actions into examples, except we had likewise their Justifica&rehy;tion to alledg. </P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Object.</IT> 2.</NOTE> The other Objection is, that there being now no opposition made to the Government of his High&rehy;ness, that the people following their callings, and trafficque, at home and abroad, making use of the laws, & appealing to his Highnes courts of justice: That all this argues the peoples tacit consent to the Government; and that therefore now tis to be reputed lawful, and the peoples obedience voluntary.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Sol.</IT> 1.</NOTE> To the first I answer with learned <IT>Milton</IT>, that if God commanded these things, 'tis a sign they were lawful and are commendable. But secondly, as I observed in the Relations of the examples themselves; Neither <IT>Sampson</IT> nor <IT>Samuel</IT> alledged any other cause or reason for what they did, but retaliation, and the apparent justice of the actions themselves. Nor had God appeared to <IT>Moses</IT> in the Bush when he slew the <IT>Egyptian</IT>; nor did <IT>Jehajada</IT> alledg any Prophetical Authority or other Call to do what he did, but that common Call which all men have, to do all actions of Justice that are within their power, when the ordinary course of Justice ceases.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Sol.</IT> 2.</NOTE> To the second my answer is, that if commerce and pleadings were enough to Argue the people's consent, and give Tyrannie the name of Government, there was never yet any Tyrannie of many weeks standing in this world. Certainly, we then extreamly wrong <IT>Caligula</IT> and <IT>Nero</IT> in calling them Tyrants, and they were Rebels that conspired against them; except we will believe, that all the while they reign'd in <IT>Rome</IT>, they kept their shops shut, and opened not their Temples, or their Courts. We are likewise with no lesse absurdity to imagine, that the whole 18 years time which Israel served <IT>Eglon</IT>, and 6 years that <IT>Athaliah</IT> reigned, that the Israelites quite desisted from traffique, pleadings and all publique acts: otherwise <IT>Ehud</IT> and <IT>Jehoiada</IT> were both Traytors, the one for killing his King, the other his Queen.</P>

But yet there be some, whose Cowardice and Avarice furnish them with some Arguments to the contrary; and they would fayn make the world believe, that to be base and degenerate, is to be Cautious and prudent: and what is in truth a servile fear, they falsely call a Christian patience. It will not be therefore amiss, to make appear, that there is indeed that necessity, which we think there is, or saving the Vineyard of the Common-wealth, if possible, by destroying the wild Boar that is broke into it. We have already shewed, that it is lawful; and now we shall see, whether it is expedient. First I have already told you, That to be under a Tyrant, is not to be a Common-wealth, but a great Family, consisting of Master and Slaves. <QUOTE

See but to what a degree we are come to already. Can there any Oath be found so fortified by all Religious Tyes; which we easily find not a Distinction to break, when either Profit or Danger perswades us to it? Do we Remember any Engagement? or if we do, have we any shame to break them? Can any Man think with patience upon what we have profest, when he sees what we Vilely do, and Tamely Suf&rehy;fer? What have we of Nobility amongst us but the name, the luxury and the vices of it? poor wretches, these that now carry that title, are so far from having any of the vertues, that should grace, and indeed give them their titles, that they have not so much as the generous vices that at&rehy;tend greatness, they have lost all Ambition and Indignation.

<P>But before I press this business farther, if it needs be any farther prest, that we should endeavour <PB
N="13">to rescue the honour, the vertue and liberty of our Nation, I shall answer to some few Objections that have occurred to me. This I shall do very briefly.</P>
<P>Some I find of a strange Opinion, That it were a generous and a noble action to kill his Highness in the field; but to do it privately they think it unlawful, but know not why. As if it were not generous to apprehend a Theef, till his sword were drawn, and he in a posture to defend himself and kill me. But these people do not consider, that whosoever is possest of power any time, will be sure to engage so many either in guilt or profit, or both, that to go about to throw him out by open force, will very much hazard the total ruine of the Common-wealth. A Tyrant is a Devill that tears the body in the exorcising; and they are all of <IT>Caligula's</IT> temper, That if they could, they would have the whole frame of Nature fall with them. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Sueton in <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">vit.</FOREIGN> Calig.</IT></NOTE> 'Tis an opinion that deserves no other refutation, then the manifest absurdity of it self; that it shoulde be lawful for me to destroy a Ty&rehy;rant with hazard, blood, and confusion, but not without.</P>
<P>Another Objection, and more common, is, the fear of what may succeed if his Highness were re&rehy;moved. One would think the World were bewitched. I am fallen into a ditch, where I shall certainly perish if I lye, but I refuse to be helpt out for fear of falling into another; I suffer a cer&rehy;tain misery for fear of a contingent one, and let the disease kill me, because there is hazard in the cure. Is not this that ridiculous policy, <QUOTE><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ne mortare, mori</FOREIGN></QUOTE>; To die for fear of dying. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Seneca</IT>.</NOTE> Sure, 'tis frenzy not to desire a Change, when we are sure we cannot be worse; <QUOTE><IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Et non incurrere in pericula, ubi quiescenti paria metuuntur</FOREIGN></IT></QUOTE>, and not then to hazard, when the danger and the mischiefs are the same in lying still.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have spoken in general to all English-men; Now I address my discourse particular&rehy;ly to those that certainly best deserve that name, Our Selves, that have fought, however unfortu&rehy;nately, for our Liberties under this Tyrant; and in the end couzened by his Oaths and Tears, have purchased nothing but our slavery with the price of our blood. To us particularly it belongs to bring this Monster to Justice, whom he hath made the Instruments of his Villany, and sharers in the Curse and Detestation that is due to himself from all good men. Others onely have their Li&rehy;berty to vindicate; We, our Liberty and our Honour. We engaged to the People with him, and to the People for him, and from our hands they may justly expect a satisfaction of punishment, being they cannot have that of performance. What the People at present endure, and Posterity shall suffer, will be all laid at our doors: for onely We under God have the power to pull down this Dagon which we have set up. And if we do it not, all Mankind will repute us Approvers of all the Villanies he hath done; and Authors of all to come, Shall we that would not endure a King attempting Tyranny, shall we suffer a profest Tyrant? <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Cic. in <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Epist. ad Octav.</FOREIGN></IT></NOTE> We that resisted the Lyon assailing us, shall we submit to the Woolf tearing us? If there be no remedy to be found, we have great reason to exclaime; <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT" REND="it">utinam te potius <RO>(Carole)</RO> retinuissemus quam hunc habuissemus, non quod ulla fit optanda servitus, sed quod ex Dignitate Domini minus turpis est conditio servi</FOREIGN>; We wish we had rather endured thee (O <IT>Charles</IT>) then have been condemned to this mean Tyrant; not that we desire any kind of slavery, but that the Quality of the Master something graces the con&rehy;dition of the slave.</P>
<P>But if we consider it rightly what our Duty, our Engagements, and our Honour exact from us, both our Safety and our Interest oblige us to, And 'tis as unanswerable, in us, to discretion, as 'tis to vertue, to let this Viper live. For first he knowes very well, 'tis onely we that have the power to hurt him, and therefore of us he will take any course to secure himself: he is conscious to him&rehy;self how falsly and perfidiously he hath dealt with us, and therefore he will alwayes fear that from our revenge, which he knowes he hath so well deserved.</P>
<P>Lastly, he knowes our Principles, how directly contrary they are to that Arbitrary power he must govern by, and therefore he may reasonably suspect, that we that have already ventured our liues against Tyranny, will alwayes have the Will, when we have the opportunity, to do the same again.</P>
<P>These Considerations will easily perswade him to secure himself of us, if we prevent him not, and secure our selves of him. He reads in his Practise of Piety, <NOTE
N="(a)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Macb. Pr. c.</IT> 5.</NOTE> <QUOTE><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">chi divine Patron</FOREIGN></QUOTE>, &amp;c. He that makes himself master of a City, that hath been accustomed to Liberty, if he destroyes it not, he must ecpect to be destroyed by it. And we may read too in the same Authour, and believe him, that <NOTE
N="(b)" PLACE="margin"><IT>Ibid. c.</IT> 3.</NOTE> those that are the occasion that one becomes powerful; alwayes ruines them, if they want the Wit and Courage to secure themselves.</P>
<P>Now as to our Interest, we must never expect that he will ever trust those, that he hath provo&rehy;ked and feared: He will be sure to keep us down, lest we should pluck down him. 'Tis the Rule that Tyrants observe, when they are in power, never to make much use of those that helpt them to <PB
N="14">it, and indeed 'tis their Interest and security not to do it: for those that have been the authors of their greatness being conscious of their own merit, they are bold with the Tyrant, and lesse indu&rehy;strious to please him. They think all he can do for them is their due, and still they expect more: and when they fail in their expectations, (as 'tis impossible to satisfie them) their disappointment makes them discontended, and their discontents dangerous. Therefore all Tyrants follow the ex&rehy;ample of <IT>Dionysious</IT>, who was said to use his friends, as he did his Bottles, when he had use for them, he kept them by him; when he had none, that they should not trouble him and lie in his way, he hung them up.</P>
<P>But to conclude this already over-long Paper, let every man to whom God hath given the Spi&rehy;rit of Wisdome and Courage, be perswaded by his Honour, his Safety, his own Good and his Countries, and indeed the duty he owes to his Generation, and to Mankind, to endeavour by all Rational means to free the World of this Pest. Let not other Nations have the occasion to think so meanly of us, as if we resolved to sit still and have our Ears bored: or that any discouragement of disappointments can ever make us desist from attempting our Liberty, till we have purchased it, either by this Monster's death, or by our own. Our Nation is not yet so barren of vertue, that we want noble examples, to follow amongst our selves. The brave <IT>Sindercombe</IT> hath shewed as great a mind, as any old <IT>Rome</IT> could boast of; and had he lived there, his name had been registred with <IT>Brutus</IT>, and <IT>Cato</IT>; and he had had his Statues as well as they.</P>
<P>But I will not have so sinister an opinion of our selves (as little Generosity as Slavery hath left us) as to think so great a vertue can want its Monuments even amongst us. Certainly, in every vertuous Mind there are Statues rear'd to <IT>Sindercombe</IT>. When ever we read the Elogies of those that have dyed for their Country; when we admire those great Examples of magnanimity, that have tired Tyrants cruelties: When we extoll their constancyes whom neither bribes nor ter&rehy;rours could make betray their Friends: 'Tis then we erect <IT>Sindercombe</IT> Statues, and grave him Monument: Where all that can be said of a great and noble mind, we justly make an Epitaph for him. And though the Tyrant caused him to be Smothered, lest the people should hinder an open Murder, yet he will never be able either to smother his memory, or his own Villany. His Poison was but a poor and common device to impose only on those that understood not Tyrants practises, and are unacquainted (if any be) with his cruelties and falshoods. He may therefore if he please, take away the Stake from <IT>Sindercomb's</IT> Grave; and if he have a mind it should be known how he dyed, let him send thither the Pillowes and Feather-bedds with which <IT>Barkstead</IT> and his Hangman smothered him. But to conclude, Let not this Monster think himself the more se&rehy;cure, that he hath supprest one great Spirit, <NOTE

<P>There's a great Rowl behind, even of those that are in his own Muster-Rolls, that are ambi&rehy;tious of the Name of the Deliverers of their Countrey: and they know what the Action is that will purchase it. His Bed, his Table is not secure; and he stands in need of other Guards to de&rehy;fend him against his own.

<P>&Iic; Heartily wish for Englands sake, that your number may be far greater then I fear it is; and that his Highness his frequent purgations may have left any amongst you, that by these Cha&rehy;racters are concern'd in this Dedication. That I and all men have reason to make this a doubt, your own action, as well as your tame sufferings do but too plainly manifest. For you that were the Champions of our Liberty, and to that purpose were raised, are not you become the instru&rehy;ments of our slavery? and your hands that the people employ'd to take off the yoak from off our necks, are not those very hands they that now put it on? Do you remember that you were raised to defend the Priviledges of Parliament, and have sworn to do it; and will you be employed to force Elections, and dissolve Parliaments, because they will not establish the Tyrants iniquity, and our slavery by a Law? I beseech you think upon what you have promised and what you do, and give not Posterity as well as your own Generation, the occasion to mention you with Infamie, and to cause that unfortunate valour, and success of yours, that onely hath gained victories (as you use them) against the Common-wealth. Could ever England have thought to have seen that Army that was never mentioned without the titles of Religious, Zealous, Faithful, Coura&rehy;gious, the fence of her liberty at home, the Terrour of her enemies abroad; Become her Goalers? not her Guard, but her oppressors? not her Souldiers, but a Tyrants Executioners, drawing to blocks and gibbets all that dare be honester then themselves? This you do; and this you are; nor can you ever redeem your own honour, the trust and love of your Country, the estimation of brave men, or the prayers of good; If you let not speedily the World see that you have been de&rehy;ceived; which they will onely then believe, when they see your vengeance upon his faithless head that did it. This if you defer too long to do, you will find too late to attempt, and your Repentance will neither vindicate you, nor help us. To let you see you may do this as a lawful action, and to perswade you to do it as a Glorious one, is the practical intent of this following Pa&rehy;per: Which, whatever effects it hath upon you, I shall not absolutely fail of my ends; for if it excites not your vertue and courage, it will yet exprobater your cowardice and baseness. This is from one that was once amongst you, and will be so again when you dare be so as you were.</P>

<P>&Vic;VHat is here treated of, appeareth to be lawful; there are not a few Examples, that it hath been followed amongst the <IT>Romans</IT>; the greatest part of their Emperours fell by the hands of private men: Some of them rather then they would fall by a private hand, or pub&rehy;lick hand of Justice, did follow the Counsel here prescribed the late Tyrant, that is, to free others from the trouble of hanging him according to his desert, by killing himself, as <IT>Nero</IT> and others did before him by poysons and other means. The Advice is good, for none that ever attained to that Estate of Dignity, or Villany, but their Imaginations were serued up to the deeming themselvs to be reckoned amongst the Immortal Gods: Men of less Dignity, though of much better mind, must not claim that acquaintance of the Gods, as these Wolves and Panthers. <IT>Nero</IT> must be deified 3 days before he was condemned to be whipt to death like a Rogue: All men desire rather to appear to be what they should be, than what they are. Their commands are of Divine Stamp: The preservation of themselves is reckoned at a higher rate then the pre&rehy;servation of the people. They can perswade themselves no otherwise, but their dignity is bestowed upon them out of singular love from above, and that all inferiour to them are given to be vassals; and that they should hold Life, Liberty & Estates, by no other Tenures than that of Courtesie: If it were profitable for the Tyrant to take all three from all, as well as one or all from some, he would do it: But he will not do that, because he must preserve them, or at least so many that by them he may subsist: those whom he destroyeth, are always the best of men. The Tyrant that is <PB
N="16">the Subject of this Discourse, since none would put in execution what is here urged; nor yet the Army, who should have deliverd him to Justice, and made him a famous Example to all after&rehy;ages; God, by his Divine Hand of Justice, did deliver this poor Captivated Nation from under his hand: His death was not a death like unto other men; though some would have it so: Not one drop of bloud was found in his Heart, who had delighted to drink so much innocent bloud as he did of many persons who were trappan'd by his Sicofants, who contrived the Plot, & drew in those persons, whose late sufferings prepared them, and made them apt matter for the recei&rehy;ving any thing propounded that had the least savour of Revenge, as Tinder to receive fire. These Sicovants afterward, became the discoverers of the Plots, and the Witnesses themselves; and the Army standing by as aiders and abettors of those horrid Inhumanities, of which the Army have (in part) repented: There remaineth yet of their Repentance, Newness of Life, that is, Never more to be instrumental in aiding a Tyranny, either in one or more. The Expedients for preven&rehy;tion thereof, are such as these; that seeing it is lawful to kill a Tyrant and Usurper, without any express Law, it would be much more commendable, and more encouragement, for Undertakers herein, if a Law were made, that in that Case onely it should be lawful for a man to kill another, that doth design, plot, conspire; or that setteth on foot any thing that tendeth to the erecting a Tyranny. Here it is not meant to countenance Murders, that after slaying a man, it shall be suffi&rehy;cient to plead he was erecting a Tyranny for himself or others: No, but his Plea for his Justifica&rehy;tion, <SIC>shalbe</SIC> attended with such Circumstances, and other Evidences and Proof, that it <SIC>shalbe</SIC> de&rehy;monstrable and evident that it was so. Without some such kind of Law, and the often reading thereof, as once it was a Custom, that <IT>Magna Charta</IT> should be read once a year in every Church throughout these Dominions, you shall never else be able to keep out Tyrants. Would you do it by Arms, he maketh them his: would you do it by Law, he lifteth himself above the Laws? In such a Case, no Hand can reach him, but a private Hand. To what purpose is it, that a Common-wealth shall ordain, that it shall be Treason for any to attempt the Supremacy, and that it shall be pu&rehy;nished with death, when such like Ordinances cannot take place, nor be put into execution: un&rehy;less that he who attempteth the Tyranny, do miscarry and fail of his Enterprise? But on the con&rehy;trary, if the Usurper doth accomplish and effect what he undertaketh, then such kind of Laws are but dead Letters; for that the Law by a publick Hand of Justice cannot reach him, in regard that now he hath made himself Master of the Law, and all Courts of Justice, in which the Law is administered; therefore a private Hand of Justice must reach him: to that end and purpose, to preserve a State free, you must ordain such a Law that great Rewards shall be given, and respect shall be had to such person or persons, as shall kill a Tyrant and Usurper, that shall attempt the Supremacie of a Nation. If such a Law had been in being at that day that the sitting of this Parliament was interrupted; and that in prosecution of that Law some one or two had put it in execution upon <IT>Cromwel</IT> and <IT>Harrison</IT> who took the Speaker by the hand, and drew him out of his Chair, it had doubtless prevented that Tyranny, that hath been over us for these six years, and might again the same day have given quiet to the sitting of the Parliament, if the same day the Execution had been done; the which, doubtless, would have been, if any such Law had been in being. Is't any other, then, in effect, than the same Law that it shall be death to attempt the Supre&rehy;macie; and that it shall be lawful for any one to kill him, that shall attempt the Supremacie: You design his death, that shall do such a thing by your Law; onely the manner of the Execution differeth: Both are good, and when ordinary Justice cannot reach him, Extraordinry ought. The Reward to the person that shall deliver his Countrey in this manner, ought to be great, he ought to have his Condition bettered ten times, of what it was under the Tyrant; which will invite some to undertake the work. Killing of a Tyrant is onely lawful, when other means faileth. It is not lawful, but when the Publick may probably reap the benefit of it. If you should kill one Tyrant to set up another, you sin against God, and Nature, and Law.</P>
