<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L.C.

It will behove you to make your Answer, what reason had you for it?</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Beasley</IT> Pris.</SPEAKER><P> I do not know the reason.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L. Ch. Just.</IT></SPEAKER><P> I speak to you, that you should give a reason; After all this trouble that we have had in this Nation, it is a sad thing that a great number of giddy-headed people must gather together, under pretence of Reformation, to disturb the peace of the Nation again, if you can say no more for your self, there will be little trouble with you.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Serj. Wilde</IT>.</SPEAKER><P> What was the meaning of your ga&rehy;thering together?</P></SP>

<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L Ch. Justice.</IT></SPEAKER> <P>How did you know which were Bawdy-houses? if you had known them you might have indicted them, there is law against them, but <PB
N="9">this is a strange kind of Reformation, if a Rabble come and saies, This man is a Papist, and this keeps a Bawdy-house, and would pull it down, this is a mad Reformation.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Messenger</IT> Pris.</SPEAKER><P> My Lord that man hath sworn I was out on <IT>Tuesday</IT>, it was <IT>Wednesday</IT> before I came forth, but staid at home with my wife, because I would not be among them.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L. Ch. Justice</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>Did not you carry a green Apron on a Pole for your Colours?</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Prisoner</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>My Lord, as I passed along by the Rout they flung a Bottle at me, and had like to have knockt me down, and tore my Apron off, and char&rehy;ged me to carry it on a Pole, and I would fain have come away from them, and could not.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L. Ch. Justice</IT>.</SPEAKER><P> Make this appear, that you would fain have got away, and that they did force you to do what you did, and I shall be glad of it.</P></SP>

<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Abraham Brookes VVitness</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>My Lord, he was in <IT>Peter Burlinghams</IT> house, and broke it down, so that you might have riden a Horse through it; I spake to him two or three times to leave off, and if I had not stoopt suddenly he had struck me down with a Bed-staffe.</P></SP>
<PB N="13"><SP><SPEAKER><IT>Cowley VVitness</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>I did see him on Tuesday with their Company, and I did see him strike at the Con&rehy;stable.</P></SP><SP><SPEAKER><IT>L. Ch. Justice to the Jury</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>Gentlemen of the Ju&rehy;ry, you have heard what these say; The Prisoners are Indicted for High-Treason, for Levying of Warr against the King: By Levying of warr is not only meant, when a Body is gathered together, as an Ar&rehy;my is, but if a Company of People will go about any Publick Reformation, this is High-Treason, if it be to pull down Inclosures, for they take upon them the Regall Authority, the way is worse then the thing: These People do pretend their Design was against Bawdy-houses, now for Men to go about to pull down Houses under the pretence of Bawdy&rehy;houses, with a Captain, and an Ensigne, and VVea&rehy;pons, if this thing be endured, VVho is safe? It is High-Treason because it doth betray the Peace of the Nation, for every Subject is as much wronged as the King; for if every man may reforme what he will, no man is safe: therefore this thing is of a des&rehy;perate Consequence, we must make this for a pub&rehy;lick Example: There is reason we should be very cautious, we are but newly delivered from Rebellion, and we know that that Rebellion first began under the Pretence of Religion and the Law, for the De&rehy;vill hath alwayes this Vizard upon it; VVe know that that Rebellion began thus, therefore we have great reason to be very wary that we fall not again <PB
N="14">into the same error, but it should be carried on with a watchful eye: And because Apprentices hereaf&rehy;ter shall not go on this Road, we will have the so&rehy;lemne Resolution of all the Judges, and therefore you are to find it specially. You must find the mat&rehy;ter of Fact, And We will Assemble all the Judges together in a Sober way, to give their Judgment, whether it be High-Treason or no; not that we do doubt of it now, for we know it is High-Treason, but for general satisfaction. It is proved that <IT>Bea&rehy;sley</IT> went as their Captain, with his Sword, and flou&rehy;risht it over his head; <IT>Messenger</IT> was there with his Green Apron on a Pole in <IT>Morefields</IT> on Tuesday, and on Wednesday he was in the same posture a&rehy;gain.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>Prisoners</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>My Lord, We would have our Wit&rehy;nesses heard.</P></SP>
<SP><SPEAKER><IT>L. Ch. Justice</IT>.</SPEAKER> <P>You shall have no wrong done to you?</P></SP>
<P>As for <IT>Greene</IT> it is proved he was with them shout&rehy;ing, and casting up his Cap: Now the Act that any one does in such a Tumult is the Act of all, if they all joyn together. He was on Tuesday following there, and on Wednesday he was taken. And then for <IT>Appletree</IT> he was the first Man that struck the Constable, and pull'd down <IT>Burlinghams</IT> house.</P>

<p>&Tic;He Jewry being dismiss'd to consider of their Verdict, after a short stay they return'd, and found that as to <IT>Messenger, Appletree, Beasley</IT> and <IT>Greene</IT>, that according to the time in the Indictment mentioned, they were met together in a riotous manner in East <IT>Smithfield</IT> in <IT>Middlesex</IT>, and about <IT>Moor-Fields</IT>, under colour to pull down the Baw&rehy;dy-houses. That their Captain was <IT>Beasley</IT>, who led them on with his Sword drawn, and that they had their Ensign carried by <IT>Messenger</IT>, which was an Apron carried upon a Pole, and so they marched with their Conductor. That they resisted the Con&rehy;stable who charged them in the Kings Name to keep the Peace, and struck him, and took away his Staff, and that these several persons were abetters in that tumult.
</P><P>And as to <IT>Bedle</IT> and <IT>Latimer</IT>, they found that a great number of people were met together armed with Swords, Clubs and Staves, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> at <IT>Clerkenwell&rehy;Green</IT> to break <IT>New-Prison</IT> there, and had their Commander who had a Pike in his hand, and came to <IT>New-Prison</IT>, and released the Prisoners, some whereof were committed for Felony; and that when they were commanded to be gone, they cried out that they had been Servants, but now they would be Masters, and that these persons were seen acting in the tumult and there taken.</P>
<PB N="29"><P>As for <IT>Cotton</IT> they found, that the riotous persons were met together upon the 24&thsup; of <IT>March</IT> with a great number of people armed with their swords, and such like warlike weapons, for pulling down of Bawdy-houses, that when Sir <IT>Philip Howard</IT> with the Kings Guards came up to them, and commanded them to depart, they refused, and when it was given out that Sir <IT>Philip Howard</IT> was the Duke of <IT>York</IT>, thinking thereby they would be appeased, they were enraged the more, and declared, that if the King would not give them Liberty of Conscience, they would make <IT>May day</IT> a bloudy <IT>May day</IT>, threatning to pull down <IT>White-hall</IT>, and very contemptuously sleighted the Kings Guards, because they were but a small number, and this <IT>Cotton</IT> was proved to be one of them in the Action, and all along acting in the Riot.
</P><P>And further, as to <IT>Limberick</IT>, he was met, with the same Pretence of pulling down of <IT>Bawdy-houses</IT>, being armed as the rest were, and was owned by the Rabble to be the Captain of their Company: that he with his Companions pulled down the House of <IT>Peter Burlingham</IT>, and stole his Goods; The rest were found Not-Guilty.</P>
<P>The Jury having thus found it specially, My <IT>Lord Chief Justice</IT> commanded the Prisoners again to the Bar, to whom he spoke to this effect, That we all now see what great cause we have to bless God, that we live under so merciful a Prince, and so good a Law as we now find we do live under; and that not only one Prince hath been so merciful, but such have been the gratiousness of other former Kings of <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, that we shall rarely find any severity used in the <PB
N="30">execution of penal Statutes, where any fair means (which constantly hath been used,) could have any effect at all, That our Justice is not privately, but publickly administred in the sight of all people, like a Beacon that gives warning to all; so that all might take notice thereof, and avoid the like dan&rehy;ger that others have fallen into. That the Prisoners more especially ought to bless God, and seriously to reflect within themselves this great mercifulness of our King and Law: for hereby they see, they have not been served so as they have served others (for then upon the very apprehending of them they might have received their execution) but contra&rehy;riwise, they have had a fair Trial, not by strangers, but by their own Country and Neighbours, having had the liberty to speak what they could for themselves, and Witnesses for them, so that if it were possible all might have been found innocent, and heartily wished all could have been so found, and that some, blessed be God, are not found guilty, and to them he hoped this would be a sufficient warning, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now as to all these Eight, against whom the Verdict was specially found, the Court took further time (because they would advise thereof before they would give their judgment whether High-Treason or no, it being declared by my <IT>Lord Chief-Justice</IT> to be matter of Law; and in the mean time these persons are to remain in safe Custody in His Majesties Goal at <IT>Newgate</IT>.</P>
