<HEAD>SOME REMARKS ON THE LIFE and DEATH OF Mr. <IT>VINCENT WING</IT>, Compared with his <SC>Nativity</SC>.</HEAD>
<P>&Mic;R. <IT>Vincent Wing</IT> was born at <IT>North Luffenham</IT> in the Coun&rehy;ty of <IT>Rutland</IT>, in the Year of our Lord 1619. on the Ninth Day of <IT>April</IT>, at Five Hours Forty-Eight Minutes <IT>P.M.</IT> or Afternoon. He was a <IT>branch</IT> of an honest and virtuous <IT>stock</IT>: as proceeding from <IT>Parents</IT> rather <IT>good</IT>, than <IT>great</IT>; who, with their <IT>Ancestors</IT> have been long seated in the said Town of <IT>Luffenham</IT>, en<PB
N="2">joying a greater blessing in their continued and setled condition, than many others in the Multi&rehy;tude of Riches: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><P>Mr. <IT>Wing's</IT> An&rehy;cestors 1st came out of <IT>Wales</IT>, and settled at great <IT>Panton</IT> neer <IT>Grantham</IT> in <IT>Lincolnshire</IT>, and neer 100. Yeares since Planted them&rehy;selves in <IT>North Luffenham</IT>, and as I have it as&rehy;certain'd me from an ho&rehy;norable hand, there have bin of <IT>them</IT> in that place three Generations successively, with himself.
</P><P>It frequently happens that far greater Fa&rehy;milies oftner change their Seats; & som&rehy;times, (in much shorter space) do also lose their Names.</P></NOTE> A <IT>fixed Habitation</IT>, being even the mightiest Mercy that <IT>Fortune</IT> can bestow upon <IT>Mortality</IT>; and so characterized by <IT>GOD</IT> Himself to <IT>Moses</IT> in the Mount. Whereas a <IT>wandring</IT> or erratique condition, or course of <IT>life</IT>, either in <IT>Persons</IT> or <IT>Families</IT>, is, not only a <IT>reproach</IT>, but a <IT>Curse</IT> to <IT>them</IT> that undergo it, and their <IT>future Generations</IT>. And this <IT>Cain</IT> in the beginning of time, and the <IT>Jewes</IT> since the <IT>Death</IT> of our <IT>Saviour</IT> have, by a long, and mi&rehy;serable experience, found <IT>certain</IT> and <IT>true</IT>. But Mr. <IT>Wing's Family</IT>, hath been happy above many <IT>other Families</IT>, in the inheriting so peculiar a blessing; and yet not more fortunate therein, than in the bringing forth this their <IT>ingenious</IT> and <IT>industrious Son</IT>: Who, from his own <IT>merit</IT> and endeavours, (with <IT>God's blessings</IT> thereupon) hath, not only preserved, but much augmented the <IT>Reputation</IT> of his deserving Predecessors; and so <IT>firmly planted</IT> his <IT>Name</IT> and Memory there, leaving to his <IT>Posterity</IT>, an Estate and For&rehy;tune considerable to support and maintain it, should their after endeavours be wanting there&rehy;unto; of which, I am (credibly) informed, there is at present no just cause to doubt.</P>
<P>Where a <IT>large Purse</IT>, or ample Fortune to a <IT>Father</IT> is wanting, the <IT>Son</IT>, though never so prompt and meritorious, must be content to miss of a <IT>liberal breeding</IT>; and thus it fared with Mr. <IT>Wing</IT>: <PB
N="3">whose <IT>Lot</IT> it was to be of capable years, and fit for <IT>Learning</IT>, even in the <IT>worst</IT> of <IT>times; Viz.</IT> at the beginning of <IT>our late unhappy Confusions</IT>: When <IT>Rebellion</IT> was opposed to <IT>Loyalty; Plun&rehy;dering</IT> and <IT>Free-Quarter</IT> to the providing for, and <IT>advancement of Posterity</IT>; The <IT>Pistol</IT> and <IT>Pole-Axe</IT> to <IT>Terence</IT> and <IT>Tully, &amp;c.</IT> <NOTE

<P>And (to go a little further in this Argument.) <IT>these configurations</IT> did, not only give <IT>him</IT> a great love unto, and a delight in <IT>knowledge</IT>, but a <IT>strength</IT> of <IT>mind</IT>, and <IT>ability</IT> of <IT>Body</IT> for the same.

<P>Among the many observables in Mr. <IT>Wing</IT>, this we may not omit in his <IT>Praise</IT>, and to his <IT>Eter&rehy;nal Honour</IT> let it be remembred: ------- <IT>That He was always a Loyal Person and good Subject, and in the worst of times, when it was esteemed a <PB

<P>Indeed, Mr. <IT>Wing</IT>, had, not only a just and <IT>Loyal Heart</IT>, but a good and <IT>Loyal Nativity</IT> to shew and to signify it.

The <IT>reason</IT> whereof, is (perhaps) <IT>a secret in Astrolo&rehy;gie, and scarce known to the best of Artists</IT>. It may be worthy thanks to divulge it; and it is this. ----- <NOTE

<P>Albeit, Mr. <IT>Wing</IT> was a Man of <IT>such admira&rehy;ble parts</IT> as you have heard, yet he was the <IT>least admirer of his own abilities</IT> of any Man in the World; but still industrious to improve them.

And though his attainments were <IT>great</IT>, yet was he known more to <IT>lament</IT> and <IT>bemoan</IT> his <IT>defects</IT>, and <IT>im&rehy;perfections</IT>, than any way to <IT>boast</IT> of his <IT>skill</IT>. He was no way <IT>Ostentatious</IT>, but on the contra&rehy;ry, very <IT>humble</IT>; and had nothing of the <IT>Pha&rehy;risaical temper</IT> or <IT>humour</IT>, but like the <IT>Laden Ear</IT> in <IT>Harvest</IT>, still bent his head downward; and (with the <IT>Peacock</IT>) more often <IT>look'd</IT> upon his <IT>Feet</IT>, than his <IT>Plumes</IT>: being ever observed in all company, to give unto others the <IT>prece&rehy;dence</IT>, or <IT>right hand</IT>, which perhaps did not <IT>in&rehy;herit</IT> the hundreth part of his <IT>understanding</IT> and <IT>knowledge</IT>.</P>
<P>But now, although he was of so self-denying a temper and disposition, and never apt to <IT>be&rehy;gin quarrels</IT> or <IT>contentions</IT> with any Man; yet hath it been his fortune (against his inclination) to be <IT>engaged</IT> in <IT>differences</IT>: he having been (by some <IT>ambitious</IT> and <IT>troublesome Persons</IT>) publickly <IT>abused</IT> in <IT>Print</IT>: by <IT>two</IT> especially, <PB

<P>Nor was Mr. <IT>Wing</IT> singular, or alone, in par&rehy;taking of the <IT>malice of Enemies</IT>, or of being un&rehy;worthily traduced. Mr. <IT>Wing's Saviour</IT> (who had the same <NOTE
