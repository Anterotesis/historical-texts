<HEAD>A <BO>JUST REBUKE</BO> TO One and Twenty <IT>Divines</IT>, (So called) &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He CAUSE of the <IT>GOD of TRUTH</IT> hath rarely wan&rehy;ted the Endeavours of men of greatest Power and Lite&rehy;rature in almost every Age to slander it, nor the constant <IT>Adherers</IT> to it, contumelious Treatment for their Integrity: No <IT>Virtue</IT> hath been so Conspicuous, no <IT>Quality</IT> so Great, no <IT>Relation</IT> so Near, as to protect them from the Fury of blind <IT>Tradition</IT> and prejudic'd <IT>Education</IT>. But as this ought not to discourage any that pursueth so <IT>Good and Heavenly an Interest</IT>, especially, when the Invincible <IT>Faith, Patience</IT> and <IT>Hope</IT> of those Holy Ancients that so heartily espoused it, stand before us as so many bright Examples and Encouragements; so neither have the many and great At&rehy;tempts of <IT>Men of divers, yea opposite Interests</IT>, to render us <IT>Unfit for the Earth, and</IT> (what in them lyeth) <IT>to invalidate our Claim to Heaven</IT>, abated one Grain of our Love to, Confidence in and Zeal for that worthy Cause: And Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord <IT>Jesus Christ</IT>, their <IT>Essayes</IT> have been Insuccessful, their <IT>De&rehy;signs</IT> frustrated, and not one of their <IT>Weapons</IT> form'd against our <IT>Sion</IT> hath yet prospered; But <LB>&horfill; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Crescit sub pondere Virtus.</FOREIGN> <LB>These very Sufferings God hath turn'd to our Enlargement, daily rewarding our Tribulations with Patience, and our Conflicts with Joy in the Holy Ghost; fulfilling to us that comfortable Saying <PB
N="4">of the Apostle, <IT>All things shall work together for good to them that love him</IT>. Having this <IT>Encouragement</IT> from God, what <IT>Injury</IT> so&rehy;ever we sustain from Men, well may we say with that Kingly Pro&rehy;phet, <IT>Whom should we fear? Of whom should we be afraid</IT>?
</P><P>With that Godly Resolution, which becometh the Justness of my Cause, I enter upon my present Work, and first of the Occasion.</P>
<P>We have been long threatn'd with a Report of the <IT>joynt-Endea&rehy;vours of many Ministers</IT>, which rais'd several into an Expectation of some notable Piece, some grave and moderate Disquisition of what had been as frivolously as fouly mannaged by our other petu&rehy;lant <IT>Adversaries</IT>, that the <IT>Controversy</IT> so long depending, might terminate with some Advantage to such as had made any sober En&rehy;quiry after it; but we had no sooner received and lookt into the Book, then we saw our selves under a very great Disappointment; for instead of some New Essay behold! an Old Discourse new vampt, or <IT>a new Impression of a Book</IT> twice largely consider'd, and some think, <IT>effectually Answer'd</IT>, I mean, John Faldo's <IT>Quakerism no Christianity</IT>, but <IT>now recommended</IT>, as the Title-page tells us, by the <IT>Epistles of many Learned, and Worthy Divines</IT>.</P>
<P>But since it hath pleased so many Persons under that <IT>Character</IT>, to fall in with his Discourse against us, <IT>to Commend it so highly, Re&rehy;commend it so earnestly, and bestow so liberal an Elogie on him that wrot it</IT>, I think I may without any the least Injustice, look upon them as <IT>Authors of this Impression</IT>, and consequently (by espousing his Endeavours) <IT>Responsible to the</IT> People call'd <IT>Quakers</IT>, for all those <IT>Miscarriages</IT> therein rightly chargable by them upon him: And I no waies doubt, through God's Assistance to evidence their <IT>Concern</IT> in this Affair to carry with it an utter <IT>Inconsistency</IT> with that Superbe <IT>Title</IT> they have either given themselves, or the <IT>Au&rehy;thor</IT> or <IT>Bookseller</IT> conferr'd upon them for the good turn of their so seasonable <IT>Epistle</IT>, viz. LEARNED, REVEREND and WOR&rehy;THY DIVINES; Words that make a fine jingle, and please and blow up Vain People at a strange rate.</P>
<P>The first Paragraph of their <IT>Epistle</IT> is a great Truth, both wor&rehy;thy of the Minds of good Men, and necessary to be consider'd at any's Entrance into the Judgment of another's Cause; It runs thus:</P>
<PB N="5"><P><IT>One and Twenty</IT> Divines.
</P><P REND="it"><QUOTE>That, as God is the Wise Distinguisher of Good and Evil; and so loveth the Good in any, as not to abate his Hatred of their Evil; and so hateth the Evil, as to love all that is Good; So is it no small part of the Wisdom and Integrity of his Servants to <RO>Imitate</RO> him herein; and not like Men blinded by Partiality, to justifie all in those whom they like, and <RO>Vilifie</RO> all in those whom they dislike,</QUOTE> &amp;c.
</P><P><IT>W. P.</IT></P>
<P>One would think by this that <IT>you</IT> had <IT>Imitated</IT> God in <IT>your</IT> Conduct towards the <IT>Quakers</IT>; and doubtless <IT>you</IT> writ it, that those that read it should think so: but why? I know not; unless be&rehy;cause <IT>you</IT> looking upon <IT>your</IT> selves his Servants, such ought to do so or else to give greater Credit to <IT>your</IT> Work then <IT>your</IT> selves perhaps believe it deserves: But let us hear what Use <IT>you</IT> the great Men of <IT>Uses</IT>, make of this Introduction; I find it in the next Paragraph in these Words.</P>
<P><IT>One and Twenty</IT> Divines.</P>
<P REND="it"><QUOTE>This Justice we must and will observe towards this People, called, <RO>Quakers</RO>, &horfill; The Fear of God and Love of Truth forbids us to ren&rehy;der them Worse or Better then they are.</QUOTE>
</P><P>W. P.</P>
<P><IT>Better</IT>! there is little Fear you will: You may turn <IT>Pelagian</IT> in the Case, and exclude all Divine Assistance; for I hope none are so igno&rehy;rant in this Age, as to think that Men of our Stamp need special Grace to keep you from the Sin of rendering the poor <IT>Quakers Better</IT> then they are: How much <IT>Worse</IT> will be the Question? I confess, you say fair; but what if you break your Word with us? Must not your Censure of us fall upon your own Heads? And will it not be reasonable for us to interpret your Use of so true an Expression to be a Trick to decoy People into a Belief, that you had taken right Measures of us, whilst you have really dealt most unjustly with us.</P>
<P>Let me a little expostulate with you in this Matter. You have either read or not read the Book ye recommend: If you have not read it, certainly you have done very Ill to recommend it, since you know not what you recommend: which is not <IT>to Imitate God</IT>, or do the <IT>Quakers</IT> Justice: If you have read it, you <PB
N="6">manifestly entitle your selves to all the Evils of it. Again, since the Strength of the Book depends upon <IT>Testimonies</IT> out of our Writings: either you have compared his <IT>Citations</IT> with the Books themselves, or ye have not; if you have not (and I am apt to think that's your Case) you commend him, and condemn us by rote: If you have compared and considered them, you must needs have offered great Violence to your Understandings in giving your Ap&rehy;probation, which anon we shall so undeniably evidence, as it would have been comparatively your Virtue, to have recommended the Book without reading it or examining the Citations.</P>
<P>Besides, the most of what he chargeth upon us to be our <IT>Prin&rehy;ciples</IT>, are not so laid down by any one of us, nor, say we, sayable by any of us upon our real Principles; but are such <IT>Consequen&rehy;ces</IT> as he through Ignorance or Malice hath indirectly drawn from our Words: For Instance, <IT>That there is no other Judgment, Heaven or Hell, then what is within us in this Life</IT>; Which is so far from being our <IT>Principle</IT> in <IT>Our</IT> Words, that it is as inconsistent with the Truth of our Creed, as Darkness is with Light: Charge this upon him , and he will tell you, I doubt not, <IT>That this is not the</IT> Quakers <IT>Faith</IT> <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">in terminis</FOREIGN>, <IT>but the Consequence of it</IT>; but then it is to be observed, that he must have the making of it. I would fain know of you, if you would be so treated with the Respect to the Articles of your own Creed? Would you esteem it just in me, to give my <IT>Consequence for your Principle</IT>, supposing I thought it a true Consequence, especially if you reject it? For Example; You are most, if not all of you, strict <IT>Calvinists</IT> in the Point of <IT>Election</IT> and <IT>Reprobation</IT>; would you take it for a candid Representation of your Judgment, that I should proclaim it to the World, <IT>T. Manton, T. Jacomb</IT>, &amp;c. believe, <IT>That God is the Author of Sin; That God's Secret Will crosseth his Revealed Will; That no Man is oblieged by the Laws either of God or men; That Men are not the Cause of their own Destruction; That there are neither Rewards nor Punishments, &amp;c.</IT> because perhaps I believe those <IT>Consequences</IT> to be deducible from the <IT>Calvinistical Principle</IT>? I am perswaded you would look upon me as an Injurious Person in so doing; yet this hath been the Practice of your <IT>Reverend Author</IT> J. Faldo: and which is less to your Credit, you have notwithstanding commended him in it, which, how well <PB
N="7">it suits with <IT>One and Twenty Learned and Reverend Divines</IT>, I leave to their Judgment who understand what Persons of such a Chara&rehy;cter ought to do and be. But I hope you do not think this to be <IT>Imitating of God</IT>; if you do, your Case is desperate.</P>
<P>But had your Carriage been less blamable in these Particulars, it had not only been your <IT>Discretion</IT>, but <IT>Duty</IT>, to have enquired if ever any thing had been writ in Answer to this Discourse you re&rehy;commend, by any of that People that it was writ against; if there had, to have procured and perused it, before you had so freely spent your peremptory Judgment against us.</P>
<P>You generally fling <IT>Infallibility</IT> at us, though it be about Matters of highest Importance to Salvation, as if it were a Capital Sin to be assured of what a <IT>Christian</IT> ought not to make a Doubt of, and yet nothing below asscribing such an <IT>Infallibility</IT> to your <IT>Reverend Au&rehy;thor</IT>, can excuse you in not examining him by our Discourses, before you conferr'd so kind an <IT>Epistle</IT> upon his Book: I ask you, if the like Practice would please you in your own Case? you have prov'd, it doth in ours, which makes not for your Honour: Some of you are Writers your selves, and thereby have ascended to no small Degree of Fame for some thing or other; tell me honestly if you would think it a Piece of Justice in any <IT>Class</IT> of Men to recommend a Book most abusive of your Religion to the World, <IT>for an In&rehy;genious Essay, an Exact Account of your Belief, a Tract that in</IT> Matter, Proof <IT>and</IT> Style (your own Words) <IT>merits the Notice of all such as desire an Information concerning your Principles of Religi&rehy;on</IT>, whilst you both disown the Principles of Religion it calls yours, and in <IT>Two large Answers</IT> have detected him of several hundred <IT>Miscarriages against your Persons and Principles</IT>? I am perswaded you will provide better for your selves. But if you must needs be so liberal, me thinks your <IT>Recommendation</IT> had been better be&rehy;stow'd upon his <IT>Vindication</IT>, since his writing <IT>That</IT>, proveth, <IT>This wanted it</IT>; and if it wanted it then, it wants it still, and yet it seems the <IT>Book Vindicated</IT> must be the <IT>Defence</IT> of the <IT>Vindication</IT>, and all the Return I am like to have to my <IT>Rejoynder</IT>, bating <IT>The E&rehy;pistle of many Learned, Reverend and Worthy Divines</IT>, in Praise of such a <IT>Book</IT>, and such an <IT>Author</IT>: May none of you, at least in this <IT>Temper</IT>, be <IT>Inquisitors</IT> when I am to be examin'd for my Re&rehy;ligion!</P>

<P REND="it"><QUOTE>The <RO>Quakers</RO> preach another Gospel, and endeavour to seduce well&rehy;meaning Souls, to whom they speak in unintelligible Words, and from whom they hide the Poyson of their Antifundamental Doctrines.</QUOTE>
</P><P>W. P.</P>
<P>Here is a great deal in a little, and very sowerly said: Were it as True as it is False, the Day were yours.</P>
<P>You say, <IT>We preach another Gospel</IT>: You do but <IT>Say</IT> it, and I thank God, <IT>You can Do no more</IT>. But doth it become <IT>One and Twenty</IT> Learned and Reverend <IT>Divines</IT>, to give so general and black a <IT>Charge</IT>, without making any the least Offer to <IT>Prove</IT> it ? Is not this to <IT>Calumniate</IT> rather then to <IT>confute</IT> us? If you say, your <IT>Reverend</IT> Author, <IT>John Faldo</IT>, hath done it for you, I must tell you, that he is an <IT>Irreverent</IT> Abuser of <IT>God</IT>, the <IT>Christian Religion</IT> and the <IT>Quakers</IT>; and which is more to my Contentment, whatever it be to his and yours, Some, and <IT>No Quakers too</IT>, think, <IT>I have prov'd him such</IT>. And let me ask you, <IT>If it be</IT> Another Gospel, <IT>To own Remission and Eternal Salvation by the Son of God, both as he appear'd above</IT> 1600 <IT>Years ago in the Flesh, and as he reveals himself within in Power and Spirit</IT>? What is the <IT>Gospel</IT> or Glad Ti&rehy;dings, but <IT>Deliverance from</IT> Sin <IT>here, and</IT> Wrath <IT>to come</IT>? And what can effect this, but the Powerful <IT>Grace of God that bringeth Salvation</IT>, which is dispens'd by <IT>Him</IT> to all men, <IT>who is full of Grace and Truth</IT>?</P>
<P>For the other part of your Accusation, That we should <IT>Say one thing & Mean another</IT>; It is by Consequence, to call us the worst sort of <IT>Knaves</IT>, by how much a Deception in matters of Eternal Moment, is more impious then any Cozennage about things of this Life; and yet you would be thought <IT>Charitable Men</IT>, and say, <IT>We want it</IT>: Is this the Way to supply us? But I would willingly know of you, <IT>By what Skill you arrive at the</IT> Knowledge of our Hearts? <IT>Inspiration</IT> is one part of our <IT>Heresy</IT>, if your <IT>Reverend Author</IT> is to be credited: The <IT>Scripture</IT> can not be your <IT>Rule</IT> in the Point; for that nowhere saith, <IT>The</IT> Quakers <IT>Say one thing and Mean another</IT>: and if you measure us by <IT>our Words</IT>, you must grant, that either <IT>you do not understand us</IT>, or we mean very <IT>Good <PB
N="9">Things</IT>; for you elsewhere say, <IT>That our obnoxious Tenets we usu&rehy;ally mask under Expressions Doubtful, Unintelligible or under Scri&rehy;pture and Orthodox Phrases</IT>: If <IT>Doubtful</IT>, your Consequences can not be Certain; If <IT>Unintelligible</IT>, you infer that which you do not know; If <IT>Scriptural and Orthodox</IT>, you must either tell us, how you come to know our <IT>Meanings</IT> to be <IT>Contradictory</IT> to our <IT>Phra&rehy;ses</IT>, and prove them such, or you must acknowledge that we stand upon Equal Terms with your selves; I do not say, upon <IT>no better</IT>, for as great <IT>Infidels</IT> as you would have us to be, we have both <IT>Dis&rehy;cretion</IT> and <IT>Religion</IT> enough, not to write such <IT>Abusive</IT> and <IT>Contra&rehy;dictory Things</IT>, as so fluently drop from the pens of <IT>One and Twenty Learned and Reverend Divines</IT>. But your <IT>Incharity</IT> far exceeds your <IT>Indiscretion</IT>; You make us to know <IT>Poyson</IT>, and to hide <IT>Poyson</IT>, giving <IT>for Antidotes, Destructives to the Souls of Men and Women</IT>. I would fain know, why the Conscience of a <IT>Quaker</IT> should not be as good as the Conscience of a <IT>Presbyterian</IT> or an <IT>Independent</IT>? what Mischiefs have we made our selves Authors of to the World, that it should not be as valid every Jot? Have we no Souls to be sav'd? Is there no Desire in us that they may be sav'd? No Honesty? No Conscience? No Fear of God? All animated to such Evil Pur&rehy;poses, as the <IT>Wilful Damning of our selves, & the Proselyting others into Eternal Misery; and rather then not compass such an End, expose our selves to all sort of Sufferings in this World</IT>? Oh bitter Invective! God, the Searcher of Hearts, will require this Injustice at your hands: You have unworthily traduc'd the Reputation of those who dare meet with you upon a publick Test, to prove their Integrity to God and Men. Why will you give such occasion to remind you of <IT>Old Stories</IT>? But of that anon. Had you judg'd us <IT>Ignoramus's</IT>, you had been kind to the Cruelty of making us <IT>de&rehy;signed Murderers to our own and other mens Souls</IT>: God forgive you. But this I must tell you, that it is not We, <IT>That say one thing and think another</IT>; but <IT>You</IT>, and such as you are, that <IT>make us think another thing then what we say</IT>, and then entitle us to your own In&rehy;ventions. I must further tell you, We make it not our Business, as you falsly insinuate, <IT>to decoy People into antifundamental Principles</IT>: for besides that we know none to be such that we hold, we make not our <IT>Religion</IT> to stand in a <IT>Belief of so many verbal Articles</IT>; <PB
N="10">but a <IT>Conformity of Soul to the Grace of God</IT> It is a great part of our Work, to dehort People from curious Enquiry after <IT>Notions & Opi&rehy;nions</IT>, be they never so <IT>true</IT> in themselves; knowing how much more beneficial it is to Men, and well pleasing to God, to have an <IT>Honest Heart</IT>, then a <IT>Full Head</IT>: DOING <IT>is degenerated into</IT> TALK&rehy;ING, <IT>and the</IT> LIFE of Religion <IT>into</IT> Contention <IT>about the</IT> NOTI&rehy;ON of it; Such <IT>Christians</IT> will not stand in God's Day: Besides, many of those, who are otherwise remote enough from saying any thing in favour of the <IT>Quakers</IT>, do frequently acknowledge, that <IT>They</IT> generally preach and press <IT>Good Living</IT>. It is our Desire to bring men into a <IT>Sence of God's Grace in their own Hearts</IT>, and to know the effectual <IT>Operations</IT> of it, to the <IT>Renewing of their Mind to God</IT>; And <IT>That Divine Assistance within</IT>, and right <IT>Use of the holy Scriptures without</IT>, are enough to inform them of what is fit to be believed. And though you would have People think very severe things of us, with respect to the <IT>Scriptures of Truth</IT>, by tel&rehy;ling them, the <IT>Quakers</IT> hold, <IT>That the</IT> Scriptures <IT>are not the Word of God, nor a Rule of Faith and Practice</IT>, yea, <IT>that we readily assert it in so many words</IT>: I must tell you, you have acted with us herein far from men of common Ingenuity; A man might, at this rate <IT>by Scripture</IT> prove, <IT>There is no God</IT>, if he would but leave out, <IT>The Fool hath said in his Heart</IT>. We deny the <IT>Scriptures</IT> in that sense wherein <IT>you deny them to be the Word of God</IT>, that is to say, <IT>The Word that was in the beginning with God, and was God</IT>, which you call <IT>the Essential Word</IT>; and, because we find in no place that it calls it self <IT>The Word of God</IT>, we rather chuse to say, <IT>The Scrip&rehy;tures</IT> given forth by Inspiration, <IT>are the Words of God</IT>. The like Abuse you put upon us about denying them to be a <IT>Rule</IT> of <IT>Faith</IT> and <IT>Practice</IT>: you leave what makes for us behind, that you may make your Advantage of what you take; That the Scripture is not a <IT>Rule</IT> in all things therein exprest, you your selves confess, re&rehy;specting the Dispensation of the <IT>Jews</IT>, and other things; and that there may be somethings wherein the Scriptures cannot be a <IT>Rule</IT>, I presume you will not deny: and that they are not a <IT>Rule</IT> in any Case, the import of your Charge, we utterly deny; for we believe and know they contain many godly Rules: I shall place this to the rest of your Account of <IT>Calumnies</IT>, and so proceed.</P>

How can you expect that we should have any to spare, whom you make to have so little, if any at all? And what need is there of giving to them that think they have so much already?

But blessed be God, his Grace has made us wiser then <IT>such</IT> Teachers; we know the Hea&rehy;venly Voice of our spiritual Shepherd, and can no more suffer our selves to be carried away with a <IT>Worldly Ministry</IT>; and that I aver to be such, which is not founded upon the <IT>Revelations and internal Motions of God's Holy Spirit</IT>, a Principle you do, in the Person of your <IT>Reverend Author J.

</P><P>Is this to act like a FRIEND to the <IT>Quakers</IT>, or give <IT>Testimo&rehy;ny</IT> of a <IT>Large Spirit and Principle</IT>, as you (to make a foul Matter fair) have so untruly intimated? Doubtless, no Man hath taken more Pains to abuse a poor People, then <IT>J.

And the Truth is, you were <IT>very hard put to it</IT> to make up the <IT>Recommendation</IT>; for in the Scope of four Pages, you <IT>three times</IT> compare us to <IT>Papists</IT> and <IT>Infidels; thrice</IT> charge and aggravate our designed Obscurity, with abundance of <IT>Impertinency</IT> and <IT>Contradiction;</IT> four Times <PB

<P>And by the Way I must needs take this notice of the <IT>New Ad&rehy;vertisement</IT> in this <IT>Impression</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>First</IT>, That he most horribly abuseth us in saying, <IT>We pretend all our Ministers to be Infallible</IT>. More then ten Times over hath he both scornfully and untruly cast this at us: We asscribe not an <IT>Infallibility</IT> to Men, but to the <IT>Grace of God</IT>, and to Men so far as they are led by it; for that it certainly teacheth what it doth teach.</P>
<P><IT>Secondly</IT>, Whereas he insinuates, as if <IT>I allowed of every Pas&rehy;sage he cited, as of the Books and Authors themselves</IT>: This is so great an Untruth, that many of them are <IT>misquoted</IT>, and almost every one of them <IT>mis-applyed</IT>; and this I have largely and fre&rehy;quently <IT>complained</IT> of in my <IT>Answer</IT>, and more particularly in my <IT>Rejoynder</IT>. I leave off <IT>Wondering</IT> at him; for he seems to have prepared his <IT>Conscience</IT> for any thing that may countenance his Attempts against the <IT>Quakers</IT>; which gives us Cause to sus&rehy;pect the altering of the <IT>folio</IT> of the <IT>Old Book</IT> in this <IT>Impression</IT>, is done on Purpose to hinder the <IT>Reader</IT> from finding his (in my <IT>Answers</IT> thereto referred) <IT>Miscarriages</IT>. But to you again.</P>
<P>Suppose we are as bad as you bespeak us; how can we help it? Your Principle takes away all Liberty from our Wills, and tells us of being <IT>ordained</IT> to all these Mischiefs: Would you have us bet&rehy;ter then we can be? that is, to expect <IT>Impossibilities</IT> at our Hands? Or would you that we should attempt to <IT>invalid God's Immutable</IT> and <IT>Absolute Decree</IT>, which, besides that it cannot be done (al&rehy;lowing your <IT>Notion</IT>) were a great Impiety but to think of; you should either change your Creed in this Particular, or seem less concerned at the Event of Things confessedly <IT>Irremedable</IT>. I re&rehy;member an Old Book published by <IT>Three and fifty Presbyterians</IT>, some of whom help to make up your <IT>One and Twenty Reverend Divines</IT>; it's call'd <IT>A Testimony to the Truth of Jesus Christ and our Solemn League and Covenant</IT> (for you know they must go together) the Bent of it is to collect the then held <IT>Errors</IT>, and bitterly to <IT>Exclaim</IT> on all that hold and plead for, or encline to favour a <IT>Toleration</IT>; and such were <IT>Episcopalians, Independents, <PB
N="23">Anabaptists</IT>, &amp;c.

And some Leaves off, thus express themselves, <QUOTE>"Doubtless, that old Serpent, call'd the Devil, hath been the grand Agent in propagating these <IT>stupendious Errors</IT>, all which <IT>Errors, Heresies</IT> and <IT>Blasphemies</IT>, we are confident we may <IT>loath, execrate and abhor, and that without the least Breach of Charity</IT>.</QUOTE> Oh the Strength and Religion of this <IT>Charity</IT>, that can <IT>loath, execrate and abhor to think that Christ dyed for all Men, or that all Men may be saved</IT>! as plain Scripture as any in Scrip&rehy;ture.

Which in short amounts to this; 1. All that quadrate not with <IT>Presbytery</IT> is <IT>Error, Heresie or Blasphemy</IT>. 2.

This Doctrine (with some Allay) in the <IT>Episcopacy</IT> you exploded for <IT>Antichristian, Popish and Tyrannical</IT>. When through such <IT>Pretences</IT> you had mounted the Chair, by a notable Figure, call'd <IT>Self-Interest</IT>, it became an excellent Doctrine with you, yea a most necessary part of your <IT>Creed</IT>: Pray tell me if this be <IT>Imitating of God? being Just to all men? Doing as you would be done by</IT>? Can you yet be so blind as not to see your selves to be a great way off from <IT>Christian Charity</IT>, and an universal <IT>Commu&rehy;nion of Christians</IT>, that even make <IT>Believing of plain Scripture</IT>, a Reason <IT>for your Abhorrence of their</IT> Communion <IT>that so believe</IT>; unless they will subject such obnoxious Passages to <IT>Calvinistical</IT> Interpretations? Is not this like the <IT>Egyptian Tyrant</IT>, that stretcht all <IT>longer</IT> that were shorter, and cut all <IT>shorter</IT> that were longer <PB

<P>I will begin with you who are called <IT>Presbyterians</IT>; Are you not <IT>Separatists</IT> from the Church of <IT>England</IT>? You know you are; And pray, what is the Ground of your <IT>Separation</IT>? Is it Difference <PB

And can I do it more candidly then <IT>in your own Words</IT>? I wish there had been no need for it: Only from hence you may observe your sort of Dislike of <IT>Separation</IT>; and how notably <IT>Presbyterians</IT> revile even Men that are one with them in the <IT>Essentials</IT> of Religion.

<P>This seriously consider'd, let me ask you, if you did not think these <IT>Independents</IT> either so <IT>Ignorant</IT>, or so <IT>Bad</IT>, as to be unworthy <PB
N="28">of your <IT>Communion with them</IT>, or being so much as tolerated in their separated <IT>Communion from you</IT>? Certainly, if so small a Dif&rehy;ference as that which remains between you and the <IT>Independents</IT>, finds not <IT>Charity</IT> enough with you to be tolerated, not only the <IT>Quakers</IT> have no Reason to expect <IT>Toleration</IT> from you, had you <IT>Power</IT> in your hands: But there is great need, that you should be ashamed of <IT>Censuring others</IT>, or being so <IT>Narrow-spirited</IT>, as not to <IT>Commune with People of a different Perswasion in Matters con&rehy;fessedly of greater Moment</IT>, then that upon which you have exerci&rehy;sed so much <IT>Gaul</IT>.</P>
<P>That You that are <IT>INDEPENDENTS</IT>, have thought the <IT>Presbyterians</IT> Unworthy of <IT>your Communion</IT>, it is needful only that we put you in mind of <IT>your Separating from them</IT>, and sitting down in distinct Congregations under a different <IT>Discipline and Administration of Ordinances</IT>; The <IT>Reason</IT> of which, if we will believe the <IT>Presbyterians</IT> in the Account they gave to the <IT>Parlia&rehy;ment</IT>, was, because you esteem them <IT>Prelatical, Tyrannical and Anti-christian</IT> in their <IT>Ministry</IT>: An ancient Acquaintance of mine, who had more Learning and Discretion then to be one of <IT>your</IT> Learned and Reverend <IT>Divines</IT>, in his Book against <IT>D. Cawdrey</IT>, doth affirm, <QUOTE><IT>That Ministry that cometh through Romish Succes&rehy;sion, and is no Ministry without it, can be no better then a</IT> Romish <IT>Ministry</IT></QUOTE>; and the Truth is, I am of his mind. <IT>J.

<P>From hence and that <IT>second great War between you and the</IT> Pres&rehy;byterians, <IT>who should inherit what you had joyntly gotten from an&rehy;other Party</IT>, are none of the clearest Proofs to us of <IT>your Brotherly Love and Christian Communion</IT>, though a great <IT>Check</IT> to both of you for your turning <IT>Judges</IT>, who are such notorious <IT>Criminals</IT>; and yet I will not say but the <IT>Presbyterians Fury</IT> was your Pro&rehy;vocation.

Tell you such an one is a <IT>Virtuous Person</IT>, and you answer us commonly, <IT>He is a Good Moral Man, but he hath no Saving Grace</IT>; as if <IT>Grace</IT> and <IT>Morality</IT> were at as great Distance as <IT>London</IT> and <IT>Constantinople</IT>: These Notions have abused <IT>Religion</IT>, and <IT>greatly injured</IT> the Souls of Peo&rehy;ple; 1. By giving them to conceit themselves <IT>Christians</IT>, though <IT>Unlike Christ</IT>. 2. In Distinguishing between a <IT>Good Man</IT> and a <IT>Christian</IT>, from whence hath flown that Stinginess of Spirit, that denies any to have <IT>Saving Grace</IT> that fall not in with their <IT>Princi&rehy;ples</IT>, and so divides <IT>Grace</IT> from <IT>Virtue</IT>, which God hath <IT>Insepara&rehy;bly joyned</IT>. This is the Doctrine that deceiveth Men, which make them too great for the rest of Mankind: <IT>Moral Men</IT> are no Com&rehy;pany for them; they may be that, and go to <IT>Hell</IT> for their Pains, if what some of you say be true. It is the <IT>Presbyterians</IT> special <IT>Grace</IT> that saveth; for <IT>Morality's</IT> Part, alas! she is a poor <IT>Hea&rehy;then</IT>, an <IT>Alien</IT>, an <IT>Infidel, without the Pale of the Church and Mercies of the Covenant</IT>; but then it is to be understood of the <IT>Scotch One</IT>.</P>
<P>Oh I <IT>beseech you</IT> for the sake of Jesus Christ, by whom alone God will judge you and I in the <IT>Dreadful Day of Account</IT>; let the <IT>Universal Principle</IT> in your Consciences have Power with you; the Divine Fruit of which is, <IT>first, A Discovery of Duty</IT> to be done; and as closed with there, <IT>next, Power and Ability to per&rehy;form it</IT>, which strips you of <IT>Self</IT>, and <IT>Glorying</IT> in it, and will work all necessary Works <IT>In you</IT> and <IT>For you</IT>: It will <IT>first correct</IT> and then <IT>comfort</IT> you; <IT>Its Wayes are Wayes of Pleasantness, and all her Paths are Peace; To Faith it adds Virtue, to Virtue Know&rehy;ledge, to Knowledge Temperance, and to Temperance Patience, and to Patience Godliness, to Godliness Brotherly-Kindness, and to Brotherly-Kindness</IT> CHARITY. Contend not against it; your <IT>Credit</IT> is a <IT>Temptation</IT> to you; sacrifice it for the sake of your own and other Mens <IT>Souls</IT> upon the Altar <IT>self-Denyal</IT>, and that Hum&rehy;ble and Heavenly <IT>Obedience</IT> you owe to the God of the whole Earth; and think not <IT>Repentance</IT> a Work to <IT>Mean</IT> for you, because you have been so long Preachers of it to others; your Time ha&rehy;stens on, and in the Grave it will be too <IT>late</IT>: If it was <IT>John's Honour</IT> to receive him when he came in <IT>Flesh</IT>; let it not be your <IT>Judgment</IT> to reject his coming in <IT>Spirit</IT>: God knows I have no <IT>Ill-will</IT> but much <IT>Kindness</IT> for you; I wish you were as <IT>truly taught</IT> of him, as you are great <IT>Teachers</IT> of others: could my Desires <PB
N="32">prevail, you should be such upon better Terms; but as <IT>We</IT> be unto them, who are <IT>sent</IT> and don't <IT>preach</IT>; so <IT>We be unto them who do preach and are not sent</IT>; It is not hard in this Sense to be <IT>Righte&rehy;ous overmuch</IT>, to be too <IT>Officious</IT>, and to act <IT>Thanklesly</IT> for God.</P>
<P>Oh that we may all consider what we are <IT>Building</IT> with, and whether our <IT>Works</IT> will stand the <IT>Tryal</IT> of God's <IT>Fire</IT>! whose <IT>Terrible Day</IT> hastens upon the World, in which he will severely plead with all Flesh that hath <IT>corrupted its Way</IT> before him; as with the <IT>Gentile</IT>, so with the <IT>Jew</IT>, as with the <IT>Prophane</IT>, so with the <IT>Professor, VVho hath had a Name to live, and yet will be found Dead, who calls himself a</IT> Jew, <IT>and yet is not; a</IT> Christian, <IT>and is not; who runs, and God hath not sent him, who cryeth, thus saith the Lord, and God hath never spoaken by him</IT>: Let us therefore be perswaded into a Serious Examination of our selves and Prepara&rehy;tion for this Great & Notable Day of the Lord, that the Sound of the last Amazing Trump may not surprize us, nor any of us be o&rehy;vertaken at unawares, but in Godly Fear wait till our great Change comes , that with Holy <IT>Habakkuk</IT>, we may <IT>all find Rest to our Souls in the Day of Trouble, Amen</IT>.</P>
