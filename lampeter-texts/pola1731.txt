<HEAD>THE <BO>CASE</BO> OF THE <IT>HESSIAN</IT> Forces, In the PAY of <BO>GREAT-BRITAIN</BO>, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HERE is nothing more remark&rehy;able in the Conduct of the <IT>Wri&rehy;ters against their Country</IT>, than re&rehy;peating the same Things, and in&rehy;sisting on the same Points, after They have been often confu&rehy;ted and expos'd. There is, perhaps, some little Policy in this manner of Writing, which may prove of Advantage to their <IT>Patron</IT>. It may serve his Purpose, for want of <PB
N="4">other Expedients, at a critical Point of Time. It may divert the Attention of the Publick from fresh Inquiries, by engaging their thoughts on the same exploded Topicks. It may give a Cue to his Creatures what is expected from them, and fur&rehy;nish them with Arguments, such as They are, for answering those Expectations and supporting Him in his Measures.
</P><P>This Winter hath been very fruitful of <IT>ministe&rehy;rial Apologies</IT>. We have had <IT>Observations on the Writings of the</IT> Craftsman; a <IT>Sequel to the Observa&rehy;tions; farther Observations; Sedition and Defama&rehy;tion display'd</IT>; the <IT>Crisis</IT>; a <IT>Defence of the Mea&rehy;sures of the present Administration</IT>; and <IT>Considerati&rehy;ons on the present State of Affairs</IT>; besides the weekly Artillery of those regular, standing Troops, the Authors of the <IT>London Journal</IT>, the <IT>Free Bri&rehy;ton</IT>, the <IT>Flying-Post</IT>, and their auxiliary the <IT>Daily Courant</IT>.</P>
<P>But as the chief Stress, in Point of Argument, seems to be laid on the <IT>Considerations</IT>, I shall con&rehy;fine my Remarks to that Piece, though it contains only a confident Repetition of Assertions, which have been often proved false, and of Reasonings upon them, which have been as often refuted. It is, in the main, only a Re-publication of the <IT>En&rehy;quiry</IT>, long since neglected and despised, but new&rehy;modell'd indeed, in some Parts, according to the Circumstances of the Times, and accommodated to the present Scheme of Affairs. I shall therefore be very short in my Observations on these Heads.</P>
<P><Q REND="it">That the Treaty of <RO>Vienna</RO></Q>, says our Author, <Q
REND="it">was the only Source and Foundation of all the Troubles, that have distracted <RO>Europe </RO>for some Years past, must be allow'd by all</Q>; though He knows very well that This hath long been a Point in Dispute, very strongly controverted; and He cannot be ig<PB
N="5">norant that, in the general Opinion of Mankind, it hath been determin'd against Those, who ad&rehy;vanc'd it. Did He never read <IT>John Trot's</IT> Let&rehy;ters upon this Subject; or, does He think that no Body else hath read them? Other Reasons may be there found for the <IT>Troubles of</IT> Europe, especi&rehy;ally with Relation to <IT>Great Britain</IT>, than the Trea&rehy;ty of <IT>Vienna</IT>; but there is no End of repeating the same Things. I must therefore refer the Rea&rehy;der to those <IT>excellent Pieces</IT>; and shall only ob&rehy;serve, in general, that it is far from being <IT>allow'd by all that the Treaty of</IT> Vienna <IT>was the only Source of all our Troubles</IT>, as this Writer asserts; or that the <IT>Union of the two Families</IT>, which He men&rehy;tions, was ever design'd; for all the Endeavours of <IT>France, England</IT> and <IT>Holland</IT> have not been since able to prevail upon the <IT>Emperor</IT> to consent to a <IT>Measure</IT>, which tends most effectually, in the pre&rehy;sent Circumstances of the <IT>two Families</IT>, to <IT>unite</IT> them; I mean to produce a <IT>Reunion of their Do&rehy;minions</IT>; but not in the House of <IT>Austria</IT>, as He supposes; for I take <IT>Don Carlos</IT> to be a Branch of the House of <IT>Bourbon</IT>; and therefore if the <IT>Contingency</IT>, which He mentions, should happen, and the <IT>Marriage</IT>, with which We have been so often threaten'd, should take Place, the Dominions of <IT>Spain</IT> and the <IT>Empire</IT> might be united in <IT>that Family</IT>.</P>
<P>The Assertion of <IT>secret Engagements</IT>, in the Treaty of <IT>Vienna, to deprive us of some of our Possessions and most valuable Privileges of Trade</IT>, is likewise repeated by <IT>this Writer</IT>; though the Course of so many Years as have pass'd since the Conclusion of <IT>that Treaty</IT>, and even our Reconci&rehy;liation with <IT>Spain</IT> have not yet brought any of <IT>those Engagements</IT> to Light. &horfill; Did the Design of the <IT>Ostend Company</IT> proceed from the Treaty of <PB
N="6"><IT>Vienna</IT>; or was not <IT>that Charter</IT> granted long before, upon the Pretension of a natural Right, not alienated by any <IT>Treaties</IT>? &horfill; How does it appear that the Demand, which <IT>Spain</IT> made, of the Restitution of <IT>Gibraltar</IT> was a Consequence of any Engagement in <IT>this Treaty</IT>? &horfill; Hath it not been fully proved, on the contrary, that their Pretensions to this Place, whether just or not, were always found&rehy;ed on a <SC>Letter</SC>, written by his late Majesty, now publick? &horfill; How does it appear that the <IT>Emperor</IT> ever concurred with the Court of <IT>Spain</IT> in any Design to deprive us of that <IT>inestimable Possession</IT>; or gave them any Assistance, when They actually besieged it? &horfill; Lastly, how does it appear that ei&rehy;ther <IT>Spain</IT> or the <IT>Emperor</IT> had concerted any ProLject, in Favour of the <IT>Pretender</IT>? &horfill; Did not his <IT>Imperial</IT> Majesty disown any such Design in the most solemn Manner; and hath not the King of <IT>Spain</IT> confirm'd his Asseveration, even since their <IT>Disunion</IT>, by a particular Clause in the Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT>, in which that Charge is call'd a <IT>Pretence</IT> only?</P>
<P>In short, the Treaty of <IT>Vienna</IT>, according to my Apprehension, hath never yet been proved to be any Thing more than an Accommodation of Differences between those <IT>two Courts</IT>, not in the least dangerous to <IT>us</IT>, after they had thought Them&rehy;selves very ill used by the <IT>Mediators</IT>, on whom they relyed. Sending back the <IT>Infanta</IT> from <IT>France</IT> was such an Indignity as the Court of <IT>Spain</IT> must cer&rehy;tainly resent; and though our <IT>Author</IT> is pleas'd to assert that the Conduct of <IT>Great Britain</IT> gave neither the <IT>Emperor</IT> nor <IT>Spain</IT> the <IT>least Pretence for a Complaint</IT>; I must take the Liberty to con&rehy;tradict Him, and can look upon such an Assertion in no other Light than as a shameless Insult on the common Sense and Knowledge of Mankind; <PB
N="7">for without insisting on the <IT>Refusal of the sole Me&rehy;diation</IT>, hath it not been often urg'd by <IT>these Writers</IT> Themselves that our <IT>Defeat of the Spanish Fleet in the Mediterranean</IT> lay still at their Hearts; and hath it not been as often proved that the Con&rehy;clusion of a <IT>private Treaty</IT> at <IT>Madrid</IT>, without the Knowledge of the <IT>Emperor</IT>, whilst He continued under our <IT>Mediation</IT>, gave Him some Reason to be offended, and to call our <IT>Impartiality</IT> a little in Question?</P>
<P>As these Reasons have been repeated in all our <IT>anniversary Pamphlets</IT>, to justify the Expediency of the Treaty of <IT>Hanover</IT>; so our Author is not ashamed to speak in the same Manner concerning the <IT>Accession of other States to this Treaty</IT>; though every Body knows that <IT>Holland</IT> acceded to it, un&rehy;der very large Restrictions; (not to say any Thing of the <IT>Peace</IT>, which was made for them with the <IT>Algerines</IT>) and it cannot be forgot that one of the Reasons, urg'd by Count <IT>Horn</IT> to the States of <IT>Sweden</IT> for their <IT>Accession</IT>, was <IT>that the Treaty of</IT> Hanover <IT>did not lay them under so many Obli&rehy;gations as former Treaties</IT>; though they had a Sub&rehy;sidy of <IT>fifty thousand Pounds a Year, for three Years</IT>; both from <IT>England</IT> and <IT>France</IT>, as a Con&rehy;sideration for <IT>acceding</IT> to it. I shall say nothing of the <IT>Convention of Denmark</IT>; because it does not appear that <IT>We</IT> paid any Thing for it; and I am at a Loss to think what Reason there can be for any <IT>new Convention with that Court</IT>, as We have been lately inform'd there is, which may be the Occasion of new Expences to this Nation; but it is plain, from this Account, that the formidable Union of <IT>Spain</IT> and the <IT>Emperor</IT> gave these <IT>two Courts</IT> no Alarm. They took Occasion to make a <IT>Penny</IT> of it, and were well paid for being ready to <IT>muster</IT>; that is, They have hitherto received their Money for being <IT>Faggots</IT>.</P>
<PB N="8"><P>Let us now see whether the Consequences of the Treaty of <IT>Hanover</IT> will not justify our Account of <IT>these Accessions</IT>. It was said, at first, to be a <IT>defensive Treaty</IT> only; and, indeed, it contain'd no <IT>offensive Stipulations</IT>, any more than the Treaty of <IT>Vienna. Holland</IT> would not have enter'd into it, even under the <IT>Limitations</IT>, upon which she acceded at last, if it had been an <IT>offensive Treaty</IT>; and neither <IT>Holland</IT> nor <IT>France</IT> did any Thing more, than prepare Themselves against <IT>Attacks</IT>; but <IT>England</IT> hath been charg'd with acting <IT>offensively</IT>, by sending two Fleets of Ships of War, one to the <IT>West-Indies</IT>, and the <IT>other</IT> to the <IT>Mediterranean</IT>. The <IT>former</IT> of These block'd up the Merchant Ships of <IT>Spain</IT> in their Port and lay in the most unwholsome Cli&rehy;mate in the Universe till the Ships were almost destroy'd, and scarce Men enough were left alive to bring them back in that ruinous Condition. The Consequence of This was, that <IT>Spain</IT> interrupted the <IT>British</IT> Commerce in all Parts, and plundered our Merchants without any Reprizals; for though the <IT>Considerer</IT> speaks of <IT>Hostilities between the Crown of</IT> England <IT>and of</IT> Spain, I do not remember any <IT>Hostilities</IT> that <IT>We</IT> have been guilty of towards <IT>Them</IT>, since the <IT>blocking up their Galleons</IT>. The War between <IT>Us</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT> seems to have been carried on in much the same Manner with That, mentioned in <IT>Terence</IT>,
<Q><LG LANG="LAT" REND="it" TYPE="stanza"><L>&horfill; nunquam vidi iniquius</L>
<L>Certationem comparatam, quam h&aelig;c hodie inter nos fuit. </L>
<L>Ego  <RO>vapulando,</RO> Ille <RO>verberando,</RO> usque ambo defessi sumus.</L></LG></Q>
</P><P>In the mean Time, <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Holland</IT> were permitted to carry on their Trade, without Molestation; as They suffer'd the <IT>Spani&rehy;ards</IT>, in Return, to besiege <IT>Gibraltar</IT>, without furnishing any Quota of <IT>Men, Ships</IT>, or <IT>Money</IT>, for the Defence of it; and indeed <IT>England</IT>, being thus charg'd with beginning <IT>Hostilities</IT>, was in <PB
N="9">a manner left without any <IT>Ally</IT>; engaged by the Treaty of <IT>Hanover</IT> to assist the <IT>other contracting Parties</IT>, in case They had been attack'd; but not intitled to their Assistance, when her own Posses&rehy;sions were attack'd; because she stood charg'd with being the <IT>Aggressor</IT>. &horfill; How this Step was under&rehy;stood by <IT>Spain</IT>, appears from the <IT>Marquis de Poz&rehy;zobueno's</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot">See <IT>Rousset's Collection, Tom. 3. p.</IT> 368.</NOTE> Letter to the Duke of <IT>Newcastle</IT>, the 1st of <IT>January</IT>, 1726-7; and surely, it could ne&rehy;ver be imagin'd that any other Interpretation could be given to such a Measure!</P>
<P>The <IT>Considerer</IT> having laid it down as an Axiom, which <IT>must be allow'd by all</IT>, and supported by <IT>undoubted Evidences in Facts</IT>, as He speaks in ano&rehy;ther Place, that the Treaty of <IT>Vienna</IT> made <IT>Coun&rehy;ter-Allyances</IT> necessary on our Part, proceeds to shew that an Allyance with <IT>France</IT> was the most proper Allyance in this Cafe.</P>
<P>He allows, indeed, that <Q REND="it">an Allyance with <RO>Hol&rehy;land</RO>, whose Interests in most Respects is inseparable from That of <RO>England</RO>, was certainly the most na&rehy;tural and obvious on this Occasion; but, <RO>it seems</RO>, the Constitution of that Republick makes it almost impossible to keep a Negotiation secret there.</Q> &horfill; Now, I cannot see any Reason why a <IT>Negotiation</IT> may not be kept as secret <IT>there</IT> as in any <IT>other Court</IT>. I confess, indeed, that when a <IT>Negotiation</IT> is form'd into a <IT>Treaty</IT>, it cannot be kept <IT>secret</IT>; because it must be brought before the <IT>States</IT> for their Con&rehy;sent; and I should be glad to know what good Purpose it can serve to keep any <IT>Treaty secret</IT>, after it is once concluded. I am sure, such <IT>clandestine Treaties</IT> have serv'd many a <IT>bad Purpose</IT> in our own Memory.</P>
<PB N="10"><P>Another Reason, given by <IT>our Author</IT>, for not treating with <IT>Holland</IT>, upon this Occasion, is that <Q
REND="it">We are farther remov'd from any sudden Resentment; <RO>and therefore it was thought</RO> the most adviseable Step, for the common good of both Nations, that <RO>Eng&rehy;land</RO> should first strengthen herself by an Allyance with some other considerable Powers, whose Interest it is to check <RO>the Imperial</RO> Power; and as the Oppo&rehy;sition between the <RO>Emperor</RO> and <RO>France</RO> must be con&rehy;stant in all Junctures and Events, and Allyance with <RO>France</RO> was certainly the most natural Allyance <RO>England</RO> could have, in this Case.</Q>
</P><P>I have put the <IT>Author's</IT> Argument in its full Strength, as He hath stated it, that He may have no Reason to complain of Misrepresentation; and I will leave the World to judge whether it can do his Cause any Service; for <IT>if</IT> England <IT>is farther remov'd from the Effects of any sudden Resentment</IT>, why should she be the first to provide against Dan&rehy;ger, and to strengthen Herself with any <IT>Allyances</IT>? Why did not <IT>France</IT> lead the Way; since the Con&rehy;sequences of the <IT>Vienna</IT> Treaty were so formida&rehy;ble to <IT>that Crown</IT>? Or what Danger could We ap&rehy;prehend from <IT>that Treaty</IT>, when the <IT>Opposition of</IT> France <IT>to the</IT> Emperor <IT>was so certain</IT>, and the In&rehy;terest of <IT>Holland</IT> made it so necessary for Her to court <IT>our Allyance</IT>, without any <IT>private Restriction</IT>, or <IT>preliminary Services</IT>? May it not likewise be ask'd, whether there is not as <IT>constant a Jealousy and secret Rivalship between</IT> France <IT>and</IT> England, <IT>as between</IT> France <IT>and the</IT> Emperor?</P>
<P>The <IT>Considerer</IT> seems to allow <IT>that</IT> France <IT>ab&rehy;stractedly hath no great Concern for the Rights and Possessions of</IT> Great-Britain; but then We are told that the <IT>Union of</IT> Spain <IT>and the</IT> Emperor, <IT>which must create the greatest Alarm and Uneasiness to</IT> <PB
N="11">France, <IT>would keep her faithful to her Engagements in Point of Interest, as long as</IT> that Union <IT>subsisted</IT>. &horfill; If so, was it our Interest to dissolve <IT>that U&rehy;nion</IT>; or can We rely on the Fidelity of <IT>France</IT> with the same Confidence, after the Cause of her Apprehensions, by the Dissolution of the <IT>Vienna Treaty</IT>, is remov'd? May not this Separation of <IT>Spain</IT> and the <IT>Emperor</IT> be follow'd by a new Union between <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT>, more formidable to <IT>Us</IT> than <IT>That</IT>, which We have dissolv'd? &horfill; Or, may it not be ask'd, why We converted the <IT>defen&rehy;sive Treaty of</IT> Hanover, which was so wisely pro&rehy;jected for the <IT>Peace of</IT> Europe, <IT>and the Interest of</IT> Great-Britain, into the <IT>offensive Treaty of</IT> Seville? For the Stipulation of <IT>Spanish Troops</IT>, in Contra&rehy;vention to the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, is certainly an <IT>offensive Stipulation</IT>, whether it should be ever exe&rehy;cuted or not; and We see that it hath already put <IT>Europe</IT> in Arms.</P>
<P>Yet this <IT>Separation of the two Courts</IT>, of <IT>Vienna</IT> and <IT>Madrid</IT>, hath been extoll'd as the greatest Master-piece of Politicks that any Minister ever performed; though one would think it did not re&rehy;quire any extraordinary Address to dissolve an <IT>Union</IT> between two Crowns, which hath been so often represented <IT>unnatural</IT> and <IT>unaccountable</IT> in the ve&rehy;ry Foundation of it. Did not the <IT>Emperor's Mi&rehy;nisters</IT> shew more Dexterity in cultivating <IT>such an Union</IT>; the <IT>same Ministers</IT>, who likewise <IT>found Means to detach the King of</IT> Prussia <IT>from the</IT> Ha&rehy;nover <IT>Allyance</IT>; though the <IT>Interest of the two Families of</IT> Brandenburg <IT>and</IT> Austria <IT>were incom&rehy;patible</IT>? &horfill; But <IT>this Author</IT>, it seems, is of ano&rehy;ther Opinion; and We are given to understand that nobody but a <IT>Machiavel</IT> could have <IT>negoti&rehy;ated</IT> Spain <IT>into such a Temper, as to abandon in<PB
N="12">tirely the</IT> Imperial <IT>Court; to quit her vast Expecta&rehy;tions from thence; and to enter into a strict Union with the</IT> Hanover <IT>Allies</IT>. &horfill; Pray, Sir, what <IT>vast Expectations</IT> do you mean? The great Advanta&rehy;ges of the <IT>Vienna Treaty</IT> were formerly supposed to lye on the Side of the <IT>Emperor</IT>; and if <IT>Spain</IT> had any <IT>Expectations</IT> of establishing the Succession of <IT>Don Carlos</IT> by an <IT>Union</IT> with the <IT>Emperor</IT>, They found Themselves disappointed; for as be&rehy;neficial as this Allyance was to Him, He would never consent to <IT>that Succession</IT>, upon their Terms. Nay, if We may believe the <IT>Considerer, Spain</IT> was so far from having any reasonable <IT>Expectations</IT> of this Nature, that one Design of the <IT>Vienna Treaty</IT> was to <IT>defeat the Succession of</IT> Don Carlos. As This is a very extraordinary Argument, in Justification of the <IT>Treaty of Seville</IT>, I will quote it at length. &horfill; <Q
REND="it">The Conduct of the <RO>Emperor,</RO> in endeavouring to delay and disappoint the Introduction of <RO>neutral</RO> Gar&rehy;risons and the Succession of <RO>Don Carlos;</RO> and the <RO><SC>Steps</SC></RO> taken with <RO><SC>That View</SC>,</RO> in the <RO><SC>Vienna Treaty</SC>,</RO> without the Consent of <RO>England</RO> and <RO>France,</RO> contracting Parties to the <RO>Quadruple Al&rehy;liance,</RO> sufficiently justified <RO>England</RO> and <RO>France</RO> in making this <RO>Variation,</RO> without the Consent of the <RO>Emperor</RO>.</Q> &horfill; Is it not very surprizing that <IT>Spain</IT> should pay so dear for a <IT>Treaty</IT>, which was cal&rehy;culated to disappoint her most <IT>favourite View</IT>? &horfill; Is it not very mysterious that in a <IT>Treaty</IT>, which was projected with a Design of <IT>uniting the two Fa&rehy;milies by Marriages</IT>, and laying the Foundation of an <IT>universal Monarchy</IT> in <IT>Europe</IT>, any Steps should be taken to <IT>defeat the Succession of a Prince</IT>, in whose Person this formidable Conjunction of Dominions was to take Place? &horfill; If This was one of the Designs of the <IT>Vienna Treaty</IT>, it must <PB
N="13">indeed be confessed a very <IT>unaccountable Allyance</IT>; and the Merit of having <IT>dissolv'd</IT> it will be great&rehy;ly diminish'd. Neither can We wonder at the Conduct of the <IT>Emperor</IT> in this Case; for how can We think it strange that He should endeavour to <IT>defeat the</IT> Succession of <IT>Don Carlos</IT>, by the In&rehy;troduction of <IT>Spanish Troops</IT> into <IT>Italy</IT>, when <IT>Spain</IT> herself had concurred in <IT>taking Steps, with that View, in the Treaty of</IT> Vienna? &horfill; But the <IT>Au&rehy;thor</IT> must have certainly been half asleep and nod&rehy;ding over his <IT>Treaties</IT>, when He let such Stuff fall from his Pen. I shall therefore consider this Affair a little farther, as if no such <IT>egregious Blunder</IT> had been committed.</P>
<P>At the Time of making the <IT>Hanover Treaty</IT>, the <IT>Emperor's</IT> Conduct, with respect to the Suc&rehy;cession of <IT>Don Carlos</IT>, was not thought a sufficient Reason for violating that Part of the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, which related to it. The Proposition of 6000 <IT>Spaniards</IT>, instead of 6000 <IT>Neutrals</IT>, seems to have been disapproved by <IT>England</IT> at the Congress of <IT>Soissons</IT>; and never relish'd, till some short Time before it was made a Stipulation of the <IT>Seville Treaty</IT>; that is, some Time before the Meeting of <IT>Parliament</IT>, last Year. The Consent of the <IT>Empire</IT> was obtain'd, and the <IT>Letters ex&rehy;pectative</IT> deliver'd before the Differences between the <IT>Empire</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT> were adjusted; so that the <IT>Emperor</IT> had made all his Engagements good; and <IT>Spain</IT> ought to have call'd on the <IT>Neutral Powers</IT>, who were to garrison the Places, at their own Expence, to perform their Engagements, as well as the <IT>Emperor</IT>. None of the Parties seem'd to think that there had been any affected Delay at <IT>Vienna</IT> in that Matter; but though the <IT>Qua&rehy;druple Treaty</IT> says that 6000 <IT>Neutrals</IT> are to be <PB
N="14">introduc'd, it does not say <IT>when</IT>. The Consent of the Duke of <IT>Tuscany</IT> was sought; whether ever obtain'd, I know not; but in the Year 1723, (<IT>Octob.</IT> 25,) He protested, by a <IT>solemn Act</IT> at <IT>Cam&rehy;bray</IT>, against the Stipulations of the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, relating to his Dominions; which <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>Rousset</IT>, Tom IV. p. 146.</NOTE> <IT>Act</IT> was repeated and confirm'd the 26th of <IT>January</IT> following. <IT>Spain</IT> never liked <IT>this Stipulation</IT>; and before and at the Congress of <IT>Cambray</IT> desired 6000 <IT>Spaniards</IT>; but the <IT>French</IT>, at that Time, did not care to risque and Accession of Power to the Crown of <IT>Spain</IT>, any more than the <IT>English. Both</IT> apprehended the King of <IT>Spain</IT>, at that Time, to have a Design of setting aside the <IT>Renunciations</IT>, founded on the Treaty of <IT>Utrecht</IT>, and of uniting <IT>France</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT>. The Persons in Power, in <IT>France</IT> since the Duke of <IT>Bourbon's</IT> Removal, have been thought to wish for such an <IT>Union</IT>; but as the <IT>French</IT> King hath <IT>Sons</IT>, those Designs must be laid aside; and as <IT>France</IT> hath now no Reason to fear such an Accession of Power as <IT>Tuscany</IT> would be to the Crown of <IT>Spain</IT>, it is her Interest to promote the Introduction of <IT>Spanish Troops</IT>; which may oblige the <IT>Emperor</IT> to keep a greater Body of Forces than formerly in <IT>Italy</IT>; by which Means <IT>France</IT> will meet with less Opposition, if ever They attack Him in <IT>Germany</IT>; as <IT>Spain</IT> will have a favourable Opportunity of enlarging their Territories in <IT>Italy</IT>; and This will be a Founda&rehy;tion of Friendship between <IT>those Crowns</IT>.</P>
<P>The Queen of <IT>Spain</IT> could not have desir'd the Change from <IT>neutral</IT> to <IT>Spanish</IT> Troops, but upon the Hopes that her Son may be King of <IT>Spain</IT>; <PB
N="15">the Prince of <IT>Asturias</IT> being very sickly and not likely to have Children.</P>
<P>It is said that <IT>France</IT> and <IT>England</IT> are Guaran&rehy;ties for the <IT>Emperor's</IT> Dominions in <IT>Italy</IT> against any Encroachments, which <IT>Spain</IT> may attempt to make upon them.</P>
<P>I answer, that the Purposes of the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT> would have been effectually secur'd by <IT>neutral Troops</IT>; but it is extremely probable that the Introduction of <IT>Spaniards</IT> will be follow'd by Invasions on the <IT>Emperor's</IT> Dominions; for though the Introduction of only 6000 <IT>Spaniards</IT> is stipu&rehy;lated, yet if They are put in Possession of <IT>Leghorn</IT>, They may admit as many more as They please by the Help of their Fleet, which is large enough for that Purpose, and will be as good as a Bridge be&rehy;tween <IT>Italy</IT> and <IT>Spain</IT>. In this Case, <IT>France</IT> will not be very forward, to execute their Engage&rehy;ments of Guaranty in the <IT>Emperor's</IT> behalf; and if <IT>England</IT> does, she must lose her Trade to <IT>Spain</IT> and to <IT>Leghorn</IT>. If <IT>France</IT> should think fit to quarrel with the <IT>Emperor</IT>, she will encourage <IT>Spain</IT> to invade his <IT>Italian</IT> Dominions; and when the <IT>Emperor</IT> complains of it, They will, without much Difficulty (according to the modern Way of interpreting the Obligations of <IT>Treaties</IT>) find out some Act or other of the <IT>Emperor</IT>, which They will alledge as a Reason for his having forfeited a Right to that <IT>Guaranty</IT>. But surely Princes should endeavour to concert their <IT>Treaties</IT> in such a Manner, that there may be Reason to hope their <IT>Guaranty will not be wanted</IT>, and not so as to be almost sure <IT>that it will</IT>! &horfill; In this <IT>latter Case</IT>, a Foundation is laid for a <IT>War</IT>; and as it will be the Interest both of <IT>France</IT> and <IT>England</IT> not to quarrel too easily with <IT>Spain</IT>, on Account of the Benefits <PB
N="16">of trading with Them; so the <IT>Emperor</IT> will not trust very readily to their <IT>Guaranty</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT> directed that when <IT>Don Carlos</IT> was in Possession, <IT>Spain</IT> should yield up to Him <IT>Porto Longone</IT>, which is now in the Hands of that Crown. The Reason of This was, that They might have no Place to land Troops at, to disturb him at their Pleasure. &horfill; I don't remember that the <IT>Seville Treaty</IT> takes any Notice of This.</P>
<P>How can this Author say, p. 40. that the In&rehy;troduction of <IT>Spaniards</IT> was necessary for the <IT>effec&rehy;tual Security of that Sucession</IT>? The Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT> it self expresses an Apprehension of Dan&rehy;ger to that Sucession from <IT>Spanish</IT> Troops; and stipulates that when <IT>Don Carlos</IT> is in quiet Possession, <IT>those Troops</IT> shall withdraw; that <IT>thereby</IT> it may be secure from all Events. The Provisions, in the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, against the Introduction of <IT>Spaniards</IT>, are founded on the same Apprehen&rehy;sion; and though the Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT> says that They shall withdraw, when <IT>Don Carlos</IT> is in <IT>quiet Pos&rehy;session</IT>; yet who is to be Judge when that <IT>Possession</IT> may be said to be <IT>quiet and free from Dan&rehy;ger of being disturb'd</IT>? Will not the King of <IT>Spain</IT> take the Decision of that Question upon himself, and give his Troops Orders to keep Possession of those Dominions, if He finds it his Interest? It cannot surely be doubted whether 6000 <IT>Neutrals</IT> are more proper for the effectual Security of that Succession than 6000 <IT>Spaniards</IT>, unless upon the Supposition that <IT>Don Carlos</IT> should be King of <IT>Spain</IT>, with which Crown the Possession of these Dominions was made incompatible by the <IT>Quadru&rehy;ple Allyance</IT>. Neutral Troops would oppose all At&rehy;tempts from the <IT>Emperor</IT>, or from <IT>Spain</IT> in Prejudice of <IT>this Succession</IT>; and <IT>Time and Experience</IT> have <PB
N="17">fully shewn that they may be more readily intro&rehy;duc'd; the <IT>Emperor</IT> having long since declared that He is willing to consent to <IT>their Introduction</IT>, and that he will not consent to the Introduction of <IT>Spaniards</IT>.</P>
<P>But if the <IT>Emperor's</IT> Conduct justifies the Mea&rehy;sures of the <IT>Seville</IT> Allies, what have the <IT>States</IT> of the <IT>Empire</IT> done to deserve this Treatment? Why should the Parties to the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT> engage, by the Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT>, to introduce <IT>Spanish</IT> Garrisons into their Fiefs, without their Con&rehy;sent, when the <IT>same Parties</IT> have declared that the <IT>Dominions</IT> in question cannot be dispos'd of <IT>with&rehy;out their Consent</IT>; nay, have engaged Themselves in a Guaranty of this very Provision? If the <IT>Em&rehy;peror</IT> consents to this <IT>Variation</IT>, as it is call'd, with&rehy;out their Concurrence, He will involve Himself in the Guilt of violating the <IT>Oath</IT>, taken at his Elec&rehy;tion, and be liable to the divested of the <IT>Imperial</IT> Dignity. The <IT>Imperial Ministers</IT> have declar'd This in very strong Terms in a <IT>Paper</IT>, handed a&rehy;bout at <IT>Ratisbon</IT>, in answer to <IT>another Paper</IT>, said to have been written by Monsieur <IT>de Chavigny</IT>, the <IT>French</IT> Minister there; and in <IT>that Paper</IT> They assert that, by a secret Article of the Treaty of <IT>Madrid</IT>, in 1721, between <IT>France, Spain</IT> and <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, the Introduction of <IT>Spanish</IT> Troops was sti&rehy;pulated. If This is true, it is very astonishing; and I hope the <IT>Considerer</IT> will allow that it might give the <IT>Emperor</IT> some little <IT>Pretence to complain of our Conduct</IT>, whilst He looked upon us as his Friend, and We were acting the Part of a <IT>Mediator</IT>. But certain it is that, in the Year 1721, a <IT>defensive Treaty</IT> was made between those three Powers (be&rehy;sides the <IT>Treaty of Commerce</IT> between <IT>Spain</IT> and <IT>England</IT>) and the Number of Troops to be fur<PB
N="18">nish'd by each was specify'd. This <IT>Treaty</IT> was carry'd on so privately, that neither Count <IT>Windis&rehy;gratz</IT>, nor Baron <IT>Pentenrieder</IT> were able to pene&rehy;trate into the Secret of it. This <IT>Treaty</IT> is printed in <IT>Rousset</IT>, (Tom. 4. p. 101.) though a <IT>certain Gentle&rehy;man</IT> asserted that the Treaty of 1721 was only a <IT>Treaty of Commerce</IT>, at which the <IT>Emperor</IT> could take no Offence.</P>
<P>It is said expressly in <IT>that Paper</IT>, agreeably to what was always said by the Publick, that the Plan of the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT> was settled by <IT>France</IT> and <IT>England</IT>, and by Them sent to <IT>Vienna</IT>; and that these <IT>two Powers</IT> offer'd <IT>Sicily</IT> to the <IT>Emperor</IT>, before <IT>Tuscany</IT> and <IT>Parma</IT> were brought into Que&rehy;stion; and indeed there are not any Words, in the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, which can lead one to imagine that <IT>Sicily</IT> was the <IT>Equivalent</IT> given to the <IT>Emperor</IT> for the Successions of <IT>Tuscany</IT> and <IT>Parma</IT>.</P>
<P>If the present Scheme of Negotiations is to bring the <IT>Emperor</IT> into the Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT>, in Case the <IT>States of the Empire</IT> will consent to the Intro&rehy;duction of <IT>Spanish</IT> Troops, and to promise his En&rehy;deavours to obtain their Consent, Affairs will be in a worse Situation than they were in at the Time of the <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>; and if the <IT>Emperor</IT> should be secure against any Danger from the <IT>Turks</IT>, He would certainly do what lies in his Power to prevent them from giving their Consent.</P>
<P>Thus stands our Case at present, and such are the Consequences of the <IT>happy Conclusion of the Treaty of</IT> Seville; which our <IT>Author</IT> calls, in seve&rehy;ral Places, a <IT>perfect and absolute Peace with</IT> Spain; though He drops an Observation, in one Place, that a <IT>War in Italy</IT> (which is the natural Consequence of <IT>this Treaty</IT>, unless prevented by some <IT>lucky Incident</IT>) must affect the whole Confederacy on <PB
N="19"><IT>each Side</IT>; that is, involve all <IT>Europe</IT> in a War. He tells us likewise that, by this <Q
REND="it">absolute Peace with <RO>Spain,</RO> all our Rights, Privileges and Posses&rehy;sions are renew'd and confirm'd; reasonable Stipula&rehy;tions are made for Reparations of past Damages; and the strongest Obligations given for putting our Trade on the Foot of former Treaties.</Q> &horfill; Such gross Assertions as These, the dull <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Crambe repetita</FOREIGN> of every <IT>Court Scribbler</IT>, require no Answer. They deserve only our Contempt. &horfill; I shall therefore pass over all his trite Panegyrick on <IT>prudent and steady Measures</IT>; (which He afterwards calls, some&rehy;what more properly, <IT>an</IT> Appearance <IT>of Steadiness and Force;) successful Negotiations; unwilling&rehy;ness to put the Nation to an extraordinary Expence, by any unnecessary Precautions; the happy Effects of the Treaty of</IT> Hanover; <IT>and the happy Conclusion of the Treaty of</IT> Seville! &horfill; I will not, I say, en&rehy;deavour to rob any Persons of the secret Pleasure and Gratification, which such <IT>Incense</IT> may give them.</P>
<P>But as this whole Deduction of Arguments is evidently made to recommend the Continuance of <IT>twelve Thousand</IT> Hessian <IT>Troops in our Pay</IT>; I will consider that Affair, as it deserves, in a manner partly <IT>serious</IT> and partly <IT>ludicrous</IT>; for though the Case of <IT>these Troops</IT> is become a Point of very so&rehy;ber Consequence to <IT>Great-Britain</IT>; yet the Rea&rehy;soning of <IT>this Author</IT>, in their Behalf, is so ridicu&rehy;lous, that it is impossible for the gravest Man to preserve his Temper, and forbear bursting out, now and them, into a Fit of Laughter.</P>
<P>In order to obviate the <IT>Clamours industriously raised against the</IT> Hessian <IT>Troops, which this Nation hath of late Years, been oblig'd to maintain</IT>, (for I shall not enter into any Debate, at present, concerning <PB
N="20">the <IT>Number of our Forces at home</IT>) He engages to prove that They were first taken into our Pay, and since continued, <IT>in Consequence of</IT> Treaties, <IT>made for the Interest of</IT> Great-Britain, <IT>and the Pre&rehy;servation of the</IT> Peace <IT>and Ballance of</IT> Europe, <IT>in&rehy;dependent of any other Interest and Consideration whatsoever</IT>.</P>
<P>If He had succeeded in this <IT>Undertaking</IT>, it would have saved me the Trouble of any <IT>Remarks</IT>; but I think it demonstrable that He hath not brought one tolerable Argument to support his Pro&rehy;position. That the <IT>Hessian Troops</IT> were taken in&rehy;to our Pay, <IT>in Consequence of Treaties</IT>, I shall not deny. Whether <IT>those Treaties were made solely for the Interest of</IT> Great Britain, <IT>and the Preser&rehy;vation of the</IT> Peace <IT>and</IT> Ballance <IT>of</IT> Europe; ap&rehy;pears in some Measure already by the <IT>happy Ef&rehy;fects of them</IT>, and my preceding Observations. But let us now examine a little more particularly how the <IT>Interest of Great Britain</IT>, as well as the <IT>Peace and Ballance of Europe</IT>, makes the Continuation of this great Expence necessary to us.</P>
<P>The <IT>Considerer</IT> tells us, that immediately after the Conclusion of the <IT>Treaty of Hanover, the Con&rehy;sequences of the Vienna Treaty began to shew them&rehy;selves openly</IT>, and obliged his late Majesty to ap&rehy;ply to his Parliament for extraordinary Assistance; <IT>which was agreed to</IT>, says he, <IT>by an Address of the House of Commons, on the 25th of March</IT>, 1726, <IT>who desired Him</IT> <Q>"not only to encrease his Num&rehy;ber of <IT>Seamen</IT>, but to concert such other Measures as would best conduce to the Security of the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom and the Preservation of the Peace of <IT>Europe</IT>; with Assurances that They would effectually make good <SC>All Such Expences</SC> and <SC>Engage<PB
N="21">ments</SC>, as should be made for obtaining those great and desireable Ends</Q> &horfill; A most ample <IT>Vote of Credit</IT> indeed! I hope it is not quoted by Way of <IT>Precedent</IT>, or to prepare the Nation for one of the <IT>same Nature</IT> this Year.</P>
<P><Q REND="it">At this Juncture</Q>, says the <IT>Considerer</IT>, <Q
REND="it">and in Consequence of the Measures, concerted between his Majesty and his Allies, the late King agreed with the Landgrave of <RO>Hesse Cassel</RO> for a Body of twelve thousand <RO>Hessians</RO>, to be ready to march for his Majesty's Service upon Demand.</Q></P>
<P>We are told that <IT>France</IT> likewise increas'd their Forces very considerably, for the Sake of the <IT>common Cause</IT>; and that the <IT>Dutch</IT>, having acce&rehy;ded to the <IT>Treaty of Hanover, immediately pro&rehy;ceeded to an Augmentation of their Troops; re&rehy;quiring at the same Time that</IT> England <IT>and</IT> France <IT>would have their respective Quotas of twelve thousand Men in readiness and at Hand</IT> for the Defence of the Republick, <IT>in Case of an im&rehy;mediate Attack; which They had more Reason to apprehend than any of the</IT> Allies, <IT>on Account of their Situation, with Respect to the</IT> Imperial <IT>Gar&rehy;risons in the low Countries, on</IT> one Side, <IT>and their being exposed, on the</IT> other, <IT>to the Forces of the King of</IT> Prussia, <IT>who had been lately gained by the</IT> Emperor &horfill; From hence it appears very plain&rehy;ly that <IT>England</IT> need not have courted <IT>Holland</IT> in&rehy;to an <IT>Allyance</IT>, which was so necessary to her <IT>De&rehy;fence against immediate Attacks</IT>, whilst <IT>England</IT> was far removed from the Danger; and I have shewn before that <IT>France</IT> was still more concern'd in Point of <IT>particular Interest</IT>, to oppose the De&rehy;signs of the <IT>Vienna Treaty</IT>; though I hope it will prove at last, that she had some Regard to the <IT>common Cause</IT> in the Augmentation of her Forces; <PB
N="22">but it is certain, from this very State of the Case, that <IT>England</IT>, being thus remotely concern'd in the Consequences of <IT>that Treaty</IT> might have hold a slower Pace and involv'd her self in <IT>fewer Incon&rehy;veniences</IT> than she hath felt, as well as procur'd <IT>more Advantages</IT> than she hath gain'd &horfill; But let us hear the <IT>Considerer</IT> a little farther.</P>
<P><Q REND="it">This equitable Demand</Q>, says He, <Q REND="it">on the Part of the <RO>States</RO> could hardly have been answer'd by the King, if He had rais'd no Troops but in <RO>England</RO>.</Q> &horfill; Why? &horfill; <Q
REND="it">Because the <RO>Dutch, it seems</RO>, are too well acquainted with the Accidents of the Sea, and the Difficulties and Delays, which attend the Transport&rehy;ing great Bodies of Troops, to depend upon such Help in a Case, which if it happen'd at all, would be sudden and too quick to be withstood by slow Move&rehy;ments.</Q> &horfill; Therefore it is necessary to keep <IT>twelve thousand foreign Troops</IT> in constant Readi&rehy;ness, at the Expence of <IT>Great-Britain</IT>, to march to their Assistance.</P>
<P>This is surely one of the most frivolous Argu&rehy;ments that was ever advanc'd in a Point of such Consequence. Will any Man, except <IT>this Author</IT>, pretend to say, that the <IT>Accidents of the Sea, and the Difficulties of transporting Troops from</IT> England <IT>to</IT> Holland, are a sufficient Reason for the Expence of maintaining such a Body of <IT>foreign Troops</IT>? What Power could intercept them? <IT>France</IT> was an original Ally in the Treaty of <IT>Hanover</IT>; and surely <IT>Spain</IT> was not able to cope with the Fleets of <IT>England</IT> and <IT>Holland</IT>! Nothing therefore but the <IT>common Accidents of the Sea</IT> could interrupt our Succours; and are We to avoid them, by such a constant Burthen of Expence, as a <IT>Land Tax of six Pence in the Pound</IT>, and, what is still worse, <IT>carried out of the Kingdom</IT>? But even allowing That to <PB
N="23">be true, against the Evidence of common Sense, will it be said that <IT>these Troops are the most pro&rehy;perly plac'd for this Purpose in case of Need</IT>? Can We suppose that the <IT>Landgrave of Hesse</IT> would leave his own Dominions in a defenceless Condi&rehy;tion, in case of any sudden Attempt from the <IT>Vi&rehy;enna Allies</IT>, and march immediately to the Assistance of <IT>Holland</IT>? &horfill; Or, even supposing Him so ho&rehy;nourably regardless of his own Safety, as to run any Hazards in the Execution of his Engagements; might not the March of these Troops into <IT>Hol&rehy;land</IT> be attended with many more <IT>Accidents, Diffi&rehy;culties</IT> and <IT>Delays</IT>, than the Transportation of Suc&rehy;cours from <IT>England</IT> ?</P>
<P>But there is another Consideration, which ren&rehy;ders this Argument still more ridiculous. The <IT>Consi&rehy;derer</IT> seems to allude to the Case of <IT>Embden</IT>, when He speaks of our Obligations to support <IT>Holland</IT> against the Attacks of the King of <IT>Prussia</IT>; where&rehy;as the Troops of <IT>Hesse Cassel</IT> can never be employ'd to assist the <IT>Dutch</IT> to protect <IT>that Place</IT> against the Execution of a Decree of the <IT>Aulick Council</IT>. It appears from the Papers in <IT>Rousset (Tom.</IT> 4.) that the <IT>States of Holland</IT> don't pretend to dispute the Authority of that <IT>Court of Justice</IT>. They only sollicited the Court of <IT>Vienna</IT> to suspend the <IT>Exe&rehy;cution</IT> of that Decree, in hopes that Matters might be amicably made up between the Prince and the <IT>States of East Friesland</IT>. They exhorted the <IT>Prince</IT> to desist from the Rigour of <IT>that Decree</IT> in his Fa&rehy;vour, and say that They are interested in the Con&rehy;sequence of the Execution of it, as it may be the Expulsion of their Garrison, which They have kept there 120 Years, to secure the Observation of Con&rehy;ventions between the <IT>Prince</IT> and <IT>States of East Fries&rehy;land</IT>. They say likewise that the Money lent by their <PB
N="24">Subjects to the <IT>States of East Friesland</IT> will be in Danger of being lost, if the Form of Government, establish'd in that Country, should be chang'd; and farther, They have always desired their Allies to support their Instances at the Court of <IT>Vienna</IT> for the Mitigation of this Decree. They at length say (<IT>July</IT> 9, 1728.) that They hope the <IT>Allies</IT> will consider This as <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Casus F&oelig;deris</FOREIGN>. They desire it may be carried to the <IT>Congress</IT>. Count <IT>Zinzen&rehy;dorf</IT> denies it to be a Matter, that can be consider&rehy;ed there, because the <IT>Decree of the Aulick Council</IT> regarded only the Administration of Justice in the <IT>Empire</IT>. When <IT>France</IT> was call'd upon to back the Instances of the <IT>States</IT> at <IT>Vienna</IT>, she said that <IT>she would, from Affection for their Interests</IT>; insinuating that she was not <IT>oblig'd</IT>. Let any one therefore judge whether in a Matter, thus circumstanc'd, and thus thought of by <IT>one of the Allies of</IT> Hanover, a <IT>Prince of the Empire</IT> would run the Hazard of being put to the <IT>Ban of the Empire</IT> for opposing, by his Troops, the <IT>Execution of a Decree of a Court of Justice of the Empire</IT>. &horfill; See <IT>Rousset</IT>, Tom. 4. p. 498, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>Nor can <IT>these Troops</IT>, or the Troops of <IT>Hanover</IT> (which are said likewise to be considerably augment&rehy;ed upon the <IT>Hanover Treaty</IT>) be employ'd, for the same Reason, to make a Diversion in <IT>Germany</IT>, by attacking the <IT>Emperor's hereditary Dominion</IT>, or otherwise acting offensively in the <IT>Empire</IT>, without offending against the Laws of the <IT>Empire</IT>. The Elector of <IT>Hanover</IT>, and the Landgrave of <IT>Hesse Cassel</IT> are oblig'd, as Members of the <IT>Germanick Body</IT>, to assist the <IT>Emperor</IT> to protect the Rights and Privileges of the <IT>Empire</IT>, when invaded by any Attempts to introduce Troops into their <IT>Fiefs</IT> with&rehy;out their <IT>Consent</IT>; which <IT>Consent</IT> the contracting <PB
N="25">Parties to the <IT>Seville Treaty</IT> have declar'd, by the Treaty of <IT>Quadruple Allyance</IT>, to be necessary; and unless there is some other Treaty besides That sign'd by Lord <IT>Townshend</IT> and General <IT>Diemar</IT> (for That refers only to the Case of the <IT>Hanover</IT> Trea&rehy;ty) there can arise no Case upon the <IT>Seville Treaty</IT>, which will oblige those Troops to act either <IT>offen&rehy;sively</IT> or <IT>defensively</IT>.</P>
<P>Our <IT>Author</IT> proceeds in the following sagacious Manner. &horfill; <Q
REND="it">But here, perhaps, it will be ask'd what hath <RO>Great-Britain</RO> to do with this String of <RO>foreign Troops</RO>? What have <RO>We</RO> to apprehend from the Forces of <RO>Prussia, Moscovy</RO>, or the <RO>Emperor</RO>? What Good can the <RO>Swedes</RO>, the <RO>Danes</RO>, the <RO>Hes&rehy;sians</RO>, or the <RO>Hanoverians</RO> do us?</Q> &horfill; Aye, what indeed? Our <IT>Author</IT> would do well to give a bet&rehy;ter Answer to <IT>these Queries</IT>. But He goes on with the same judicious Observations. &horfill; <Q
REND="it">It was our Business to lie by; to wait; and see the Conse&rehy;quences and Events of the <RO>Vienna Treaty</RO>, and to take our Measures accordingly, at a proper Season.</Q> &horfill; No Doubt on't, Mr. <IT>Considerer</IT>; but you seem to think that you have cut us quite down in what follows. It would be unfair therefore not to quote it. &horfill; <Q
REND="it">This indeed</Q>, say you, <Q REND="it">would have been a prudent Step, if the Terms of the <RO>Vienna Treaty</RO>, and the Measures taken, and the Forces rais'd in Consequence of it, by the contracting Parties, had not been directly levell'd at the Interest of <RO>Great&rehy;Britain</RO>. This would be a very plausible Doctrine, if the Possessions of <RO>Gibraltar</RO> and <RO>Port-Mahon</RO>; if the Trade to <RO>Italy</RO> and <RO>Spain</RO>, to the <RO>East</RO> and <RO>West-In&rehy;dies</RO>, and the <RO>Baltick</RO>; if the <RO>Ballance</RO> of <RO>Europe</RO>, and the <RO>present, happy Establishment</RO> were become indifferent Things to this Nation; as indeed, one would think, They were, especially the <RO>last</RO>, by the <PB
N="26">weekly licentious Writings of some Gentlemen, who would be thought to be Men of no little Consequence.</Q> &horfill; I have but a single Objection to all this Vein of shrewd Reasoning; which is, that every one of the Points, mention'd by the <IT>Author</IT>, remains to be prov'd, as I have observ'd before; and if They cannot be proved, He plainly owns the Folly of our Conduct. As to the <IT>last Point</IT>, I shall have Occasion to consider that Charge in a&rehy;nother Place; and will only observe, at present, that <IT>those Gentlemen</IT>, to whom He alludes, cannot have discover'd a <IT>greater Indifference to the present, hap&rehy;py Establishment, in their weekly, licentious Writings</IT>, than some <IT>other Gentlemen</IT> have discover'd, by their extraordinary Measures, to the <IT>Trade of this King&rehy;dom</IT> and the <IT>Ballance of Europe</IT>; the <IT>former</IT> of which is, I am afraid, too manifestly negotiated into <IT>French</IT> Hands, and the <IT>latter</IT> very much im&rehy;pair'd, in its most beneficial Branches, by some <IT>late wise Treaties</IT>.</P>
<P>Having given us these exquisite Reasons for taking the <IT>Hessian</IT> Troops into our Pay, He pro&rehy;duces a <IT>Muster-Roll</IT> of the Forces on both Sides, as They stood in the Year 1727; which I shall draw up in opposite Columns, or (to use the <IT>Author's</IT> Words) in <IT>Battle Array</IT>, against each other.</P>

</P><P>I wonder the <IT>Considerer</IT>, when He was giving us a List of the <IT>confederate Forces</IT>, (as He ex&rehy;presses it) on both Sides, should forget our great Ally, the Duke of <IT>Wolfenbuttle</IT>; who enter'd into a Guaranty of all the <IT>British</IT> Dominions; and sti&rehy;pulated, I think, to furnish a Body of 5000 Men, in Case of need; but perhaps, He consider'd the <IT>secret Articles</IT> of that Allyance; by which it is pro&rehy;vided that <IT>these Troops</IT> are not to move out of <IT>Germany</IT> in our Defence. &horfill; Let us therefore return to the State of <IT>two Allyances</IT> of <IT>Hanover</IT> and <IT>Vienna</IT>, as They stood in the Year 1727; upon which our <IT>Author</IT> makes the following Remark. &horfill; <Q

<P>I hope He will give me Leave to add my Opi&rehy;nion that this Arrangement of the Forces, in re<PB
N="28">gular <IT>Battalia</IT>, on both Sides, shews the busy Ge&rehy;nius of <IT>some Gentlemen</IT>, who have taken great Pains to arm all <IT>Europe</IT>, at the Expence of their <IT>own Country</IT>; and if They should be able to dis&rehy;arm it again, at an equal Expence, what other Merit will They have, than That of conjuring down a <IT>Spirit</IT> of their own raising? &horfill; But the Reader will perceive that the <IT>Considerer</IT> grows quite <IT>ludicrous</IT>, towards the latter End of his Performance; and the Laugh would be justly turn'd upon us, if We should enter into a <IT>grave</IT> Confutation of his Ar&rehy;guments.</P>
<P>He seems to insunate, by this <IT>List of the Forces on both Sides</IT>, that instead of 12,000 <IT>Hessians</IT> our <IT>excellent Ministers</IT> ought to have demanded 83,000; and that it is owing to their extreme Modera&rehy;tion, that the desireable Work of a <IT>Peace</IT> hath not been yet accomplished; for, according to the <IT>Rule of Three</IT>, if 12,000 <IT>Hessians</IT> can procure us a <IT>Peace</IT> in <IT>five Years</IT>, 83,000 <IT>Hessians</IT> would have done it in about the <IT>seventh</IT> Part of that Time.</P>
<P>To shew that the <IT>Hanover Allies</IT> went on, Hand in Hand together, He tells us that the <IT>Dutch</IT> not only augmented their <IT>Land Forces</IT>, but <IT>had like&rehy;wise made</IT> Preparations <IT>to fit out eighteen Men of War</IT>. Nay, He might have added that They ac&rehy;tually shew'd out a Fleet, at <IT>Spithead</IT>, for several Months together; and though it might not, per&rehy;haps, be victuall'd and provided for any <IT>farther Voyage</IT>; yet it must be confess'd to be an <IT>Appearance of Steadiness and Force</IT>, at least; and considering the great Advantages, which <IT>England</IT> hath reap'd from the <IT>Hanover Allyance</IT>, it may be put in Bal&rehy;lance against the several great Squadrons, which she hath been at the Expence of sending to all Parts of the World.</P>
<PB N="29"><P>As to the <IT>French</IT>, the <IT>same Author</IT> tells us that They had got every Thing ready <IT>for taking the Field</IT>. The only Question was <SC>Where</SC> <IT>They should take the Field</IT>; and at last a very wise Thought jump'd into the Head of a <IT>certain Gentleman, viz. to whose Advantage the Events even of a</IT> successful War <IT>might turn</IT>; which hath hitherto prevented them <IT>from taking the Field</IT> any where.
</P><P>However, this equal Co-operation of the <IT>Hano&rehy;ver Allies</IT>, with our <IT>Hessian</IT> Auxiliaries, made the <IT>Emperor</IT> look about Him, and consent to a Plan of <IT>Preliminaries</IT>; which would certainly have produc'd an <IT>absolute Peace</IT>, long before the <IT>Treaty of Seville</IT> effected it; had not <IT>Spain been provok'd at these Steps</IT>, taken without her Approbation, and <IT>entertain'd some small Hopes of Disturbances in</IT> England, <IT>on Account of the</IT> late King's <IT>Death</IT>. &horfill; It may be ask'd, per&rehy;haps, what <IT>Hopes</IT>, of this Nature, <IT>Spain</IT> could pos&rehy;sibly entertain upon his present Majesty's Accession to the Throne with the general Acclamations of all Parties? I answer, from the <IT>Change of the Ministry</IT>; which would have occasion'd <IT>Disturbances</IT>, no Doubt, of the utmost Consequence to all <IT>Europe</IT>.</P>
<P>However, these <IT>separate Negotiations with the Emperor</IT> (which his <IT>Ministers were artfully drawn into</IT>) gave such Umbrage to <IT>Spain</IT>, that They like&rehy;wise came into <IT>separate Negotiations</IT> with us and concluded that <IT>absolute Peace</IT>, call'd the <IT>Treaty of Seville</IT>, which gave the <IT>Emperor</IT> Umbrage, in his Turn; and This is the Foot, which We stand up&rehy;on at present.</P>
<P>Here the <IT>Considerer</IT> asks another wise Question; or, which is much the same Thing, puts it into the Mouth of an <IT>Adversary</IT>.</P>
<P><Q REND="it">But of what Use</Q>, says He, <Q REND="it">can the <RO>Hessians</RO> be for the Execution of the Treaty of <RO>Seville</RO>; and <PB
N="30">particularly for the Introduction of <RO>Spanish</RO> Garri&rehy;sons into <RO>Tuscany</RO> and <RO>Parma</RO>?</Q></P>
<P>In Answer to This, the <IT>Considerer</IT> gives us many weighty Arguments, to shew that <IT>these Troops</IT> are of the utmost Use, not only upon this Occa&rehy;sion, but likewise upon all Occasions, that can pos&rehy;sibly happen in <IT>Europe</IT>.</P>
<P>In order to set this Matter in the clearest Light, I must desire the Reader to recollect that it ap&rehy;pears by the Account of the <IT>two Allyances</IT>, as it stood when <IT>Spain</IT> and the <IT>Emperor</IT> were toge&rehy;ther, that the Land Forces on the <IT>Vienna</IT> Side over-ballanc'd Those of the <IT>Hanover Allies</IT> by 83,000 Men; but the Forces of <IT>Spain, (viz.</IT> 60,000) being taken from <IT>one Side</IT> and plac'd to the <IT>other</IT>, will make the Confederates of <IT>Hanover</IT> more numerous than Those of <IT>Vienna</IT> by 37,000; from whence it may be inferr'd, perhaps, that there is not so great a Necessity of the 12000 <IT>Hessians</IT>; which would be true, if it were fix'd on which Side the <IT>Hessians</IT> are to be; but as it is yet impossible to know which of the two Pow&rehy;ers (<IT>Spain</IT> or the <IT>Emperor</IT>) will be most refracto&rehy;ry; and as Care must be always taken of the <IT>Ballance</IT> of <IT>Europe</IT>; it follows, according to this <IT>Gentleman's</IT> incomparable Reasoning, that there will always be a Necessity of keeping up the <IT>Hes&rehy;sians</IT>, whether the <IT>Emperor</IT> or <IT>Spain</IT> stands out, or <IT>both</IT>, in order to maintain the <IT>Ballance</IT> of <IT>Eu&rehy;rope</IT>.</P>
<P>In short, I cannot compare the Author's Rea&rehy;soning, in this most excellent Dissertation, to any Thing, but a strong <IT>Chain</IT>, consisting of several Links; each of which, as it is infrangible in its self, so is it inseparable from any of the rest. It is necessary therefore to lay it out at its full <PB
N="31">Length, in order to form a true Judgment of it, and then observe how the whole is connected for the Interest of <IT>Great Britain</IT>.</P>
<P>In demonstrating the Necessity of keeping up the <IT>Hessians</IT>, the Author proceeds in the follow&rehy;ing Manner; and the first Joint of his <IT>Sorites</IT>, or <IT>Rat's Tail</IT>, is a <FOREIGN

<ITEM><LABEL>6.</LABEL> <IT>p.</IT> 28. The <IT>Peace</IT> not being yet concluded, at the Congress of <IT>Soissons</IT>, made it necessary to continue the <IT>Hessians</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>7.</LABEL> P. 29.

Therefore it was neces&rehy;sary to keep up the <IT>Hessians</IT>, that We might be in a Readiness to assist <IT>France</IT>, in order to make <IT>France</IT> ready to assist us.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>8.</LABEL> <IT>p.</IT> 32. The Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT> could never have been accomplished without the <IT>Hessians</IT>; and therefore the <IT>Security of our Possessions</IT> and the <IT>full <PB

<ITEM><LABEL>9.</LABEL> <IT>p.</IT> 34.

<ITEM><LABEL>11.</LABEL> <IT>p.</IT> 36. As there are now but small Hopes of gaining the <IT>Emperor's</IT> Consent to the Introduction of <IT>Spanish</IT> Troops, by Way of <IT>Negotiation</IT>; and as it is impossible to do it by <IT>Force</IT>, without the <IT>Hessians; Spain</IT> hath a Right, by the Treaty of <IT>Seville</IT>, to demand the <IT>Hessians; for why should</IT> England <IT>expect to reap the Fruits of successful Nego&rehy;tiations, without Expence</IT>?</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>12.</LABEL> P. 42. The <IT>Emperor</IT> having, at present, a large Body of Forces in <IT>Italy</IT>, makes it neces&rehy;sary to keep up the <IT>Hessians</IT>.</ITEM>

The Distress of <IT>Trade</IT>, the Loss of <IT>Gibraltar</IT> and <IT>Portmahon</IT>, the Reparation of <IT>Dunkirk</IT>, the <IT>Violation of all our Treaties</IT>, the total Subversion of the Protestant Establishment in the <IT>House of Hanover</IT>, and <IT>throwing the whole World <PB
N="33">into Confusion</IT>, will be the fatal Consequences of &horfill; disbanding the <IT>Hessians</IT>.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>From whence it follows that it is a <IT>most abo&rehy;minable Practice</IT> to talk of the <IT>Debts of the Na&rehy;tion</IT>, and <IT>sending Money abroad to pay foreign Troops</IT> in a Point of such <IT>publick Utility</IT> &horfill; as the <IT>Hessians</IT>. The <IT>Hessians</IT>! who are the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Triarii</FOREIGN> of <IT>Great Britain</IT>; her last Resort in all Cases, both in <IT>Peace</IT> and <IT>War</IT>; both at <IT>Home</IT> and <IT>Abroad</IT>; howsoever <IT>ally'd</IT>, or wheresoever <IT>distress'd</IT>!</P>
<P>But we must now be a little serious again; for the <IT>Subject</IT> requires it, though not the <IT>Author</IT> of his <IT>Manner</IT> of Reasoning.</P>
<P><Q REND="it">Although this Deduction</Q>, says He, <Q REND="it">is gone into so great a Length; yet it seems necessary, before I conclude, to remove some Insinuations, industriously spread against the <RO>Hessian</RO> Troops; as if they were not hired, or continued in our Pay, for the Sake and Interest of <RO>Great Britain</RO>.</Q></P>
<P>I think the <IT>Author</IT> Himself hath pretty plainly confirm'd the Truth of such <IT>Insinuations</IT>; but He prudently lays them to the Charge of the <IT>Enemies of the Government</IT>; (that is of the <IT>Ministry</IT>;) who are, in a Manner, defy'd to <IT>produce one Reason or Fact, during the Negotiations and Transactions of so many Years, to shew the Probability of such an Imputa&rehy;tion; and if the</IT> Author <IT>is rightly inform'd, not one Word had pass'd for some Years, before the Conclu&rehy;sion of the</IT> Treaty of Vienna, <IT>about</IT> Bremen <IT>and</IT> Verhden. &horfill; Though I am no <IT>Enemy of the Go&rehy;vernment</IT>, I very much suspect the Truth of this <IT>Information</IT>, and think myself able to prove the Falshood of it; but as I have not Room to enter into such a Deduction, at present, I shall content myself with presenting the <IT>Considerer</IT> with a Pas&rehy;sage out of the Works of one of his <IT>Fellow-La&rehy;bourers in the Ministry</IT>; by Name <IT>Francis Walsing<PB
N="34">ham</IT>, Esq; who, in Order to shew the superior Fidelity of the <IT>French</IT> to the <IT>Germans</IT>, gave us the following judicious Intimation, in his <IT>Free Briton</IT> of <IT>Thursday November the 26th</IT>, 1730, N&osup;. 52; &horfill; <Q
REND="it">Had the antient Proverb of <RO>German Faith</RO> been infallible, a <RO>certain great Prince</RO> had granted an <RO><SC>Investiture</SC>;</RO> which He once so&rehy;lemnly promised, on a very <RO>valuable Consideration;</RO> nor would He have expected a <RO><SC>Million Sterling</SC>,</RO> as a refreshing Fee.</Q> &horfill; I do not quote this <IT>low Fellow</IT>, by Way of <IT>Authority</IT>, but only for the Sake of <IT>Information</IT>; for as contemptible a <IT>Writer</IT> as He is in Himself, He sometimes blabs out <IT>Se&rehy;crets</IT>, which are intrusted to Him, in Confidence, by his <IT>Pay-master</IT>. &horfill; I wish therefore He would let us know, who this <IT>certain Prince</IT> is, <IT>what In&rehy;vestiture</IT> He means; what <IT>valuable Consideration</IT> was paid for it; and from <SC>Whom</SC> <IT>that Prince</IT> hath expected a <IT>Million Sterling</IT>, as a <IT>refreshing Fee</IT> &horfill; The Resolution of these Questions might, perhaps, clear up the Dispute, whether <IT>Sicily</IT> was granted as an <IT>Equivalent</IT> to the <IT>Emperor</IT> for his Consent to the Disposition of the <IT>Italian Dominions</IT>, in Favour of <IT>Don Carlos</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Votes of Parliament</IT>, which the <IT>Author</IT> quotes in Justification of the <IT>Hessians</IT>, and for the Sup&rehy;port of his Majesty's <IT>foreign Dominions</IT>, are very little to the Purpose; because what is prudent at <IT>one Time</IT> may not be prudent at <IT>all Times</IT>. &horfill; Besides, I presume, <IT>this Author</IT> will not insist upon a <IT>Vote of Parliament</IT> as an unanswerable Argument in it self for the Wisdom, or Reasonableness of any Measure. <IT>The Defeat of the</IT> Spanish Fleet <IT>in the Mediterranean</IT>, if I mistake not, was voted by Parliament a <IT>wise</IT> and <IT>just Action</IT>; and yet our <IT>Ministers</IT> seem to have quite different Sentiments of it, at present.</P>
<PB N="35"><P>The <IT>Considerer</IT> puts the Dominions of <IT>Hanover</IT> upon the same Foot with all other Dominions in <IT>Allyance</IT> with us; and from thenc argues that they have an equal Right to our Protection; espe&rehy;cially if they were attack'd out of Resentment for his Majesty's Conduct as King of <IT>Great Britain</IT>. But, even supposing This to be the Case, are they not a Weight upon the Strength of <IT>England</IT>? Are they not a constant Pledge, as it were, in the <IT>Em&rehy;peror's</IT> Hands; which may tempt Him, at any Time, to insist upon high Terms? Or would it be in his Power to molest us at all, if it were not for <IT>these Dominions</IT>?
</P><P>The <IT>Author</IT> speaks out at last, and tells us very plainly that though <Q
REND="it">there is no formal Allyance be&rehy;tween <RO>Great Britain</RO> and <RO>Hanover</RO> (the Quality of <RO>King</RO> and <RO>Elector</RO> residing in the same Person) yet the <RO><SC>Union</SC></RO> between the two Governments, and the Obligations of <RO>mutual Defence</RO> and <RO>Guaranty</RO> are as strongly and necessarily imply'd, as the most for&rehy;mal Treaties and Conventions could possibly make them.</Q></P>
<P>What <SC>Union</SC> <IT>of the two Governments</IT> can the <IT>Author</IT> possibly mean? Though We have the Hap&rehy;piness of living under the <IT>same Prince</IT>, I thank God, We do not live under the <IT>same Form of Go&rehy;vernment</IT>. Ours is <IT>limited</IT>; theirs is <IT>absolute</IT>; and whilst this Difference subsists, there can be no <IT>Union</IT> between them. But if the <IT>Obligations of</IT> mutual Defence <IT>and</IT> Guaranty <IT>are as strongly and necessarily imply'd as the most formal Treaties and Conventions could possibly make them</IT>; I should be glad to be inform'd what Effect that excellent Provi&rehy;sion in the <IT>Act of Settlement</IT> can ever have, which was made <IT>to secure us from the Danger and Ex&rehy;pence of Wars, on Account of any Dominions, not belonging to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms</IT>.</P>
<PB N="36"><P><IT>The single Question is (as our Author</IT> states it Himself) <IT>whether the Continuance of the</IT> Hessian <IT>Troops, in the Pay of</IT> Great Britain, <IT>be for the Ho&rehy;nour and Interest of the King and this Kingdom</IT>; which, I hope, hath been fairly examined in the preceding Pages.
</P><P>The only Observation, that I shall make farther, is, that though <IT>our Author desires this Controversy may be confin'd to the true Merits of the Question, without any Misrepresentations</IT>; yet He concludes with the basest Reflection on <IT>those Gentlemen</IT>, who differ from Him in this Measure, as Persons, <IT>who are really grieved, not that We have any Thing to do with</IT> Hanover Dominions, <IT>but that We have any Thing to do with the</IT> Elector of Hanover.</P>
<P>As infamous as the Design of this Reflection is, I will venture to say there are multitudes of Persons, in this Kingdom, zealously affected to the <IT>Elector of Hanover</IT>, who heartily wish that <IT>We had nothing to do with the</IT> Hanover Dominions; but We must al&rehy;ways expect these mean Arts from Men, who want better Arguments; for as <IT>no Bishop, no King</IT> was the Cant-Expression of one Reign; it is now turn'd into <IT>no W&horfill;le, no House of Hanover</IT>!</P>
<P>But We trust in his Majesty's Wisdom, that He will not only separate the <IT>Royal Character</IT> from the <IT>Minister</IT>, but likewise consider Himself in a <IT>double Capacity</IT>, as King of <IT>Great Britain</IT> and Elector of <IT>Hanover</IT>. He will have the Goodness to excuse the laudable Partiality of <IT>Englishmen</IT> to&rehy;wards their <IT>own Country</IT>, and not make the Case of <IT>Twelve Thousand Hessians</IT> (which They may appre&rehy;hend to be an useless Burthen upon them) the only Criterion of Loyalty to his Person and Affection to his Government.</P>
