<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Reader is to be adver&rehy;tis'd, not to expect in the fol&rehy;lowing Essay a Regular, or so much as a Coherent, Discourse. For it was intended only as a collecti&rehy;on of loose Experiments and Observati&rehy;ons about the Porosity of the parts of Bo&rehy;dies belonging <ADD
RESP="compiler">(</ADD>as Chymists speak) to the Animal Kingdom, and laid (not to say thrown) together, in order to what I had thoughts of offering, to&rehy;wards an Intelligible account of Occult Qualities. I am not ignorant, that even one of the most ancient and famous of Physicians hath said, that a mans body is <PB
N="[ii]">(almost) every where perspirable. But I judg'd that a Doctrine of such mo&rehy;ment, and which diverse things in the Theory and Practice of after Physicians may make one think they either disbe&rehy;lieved or disregarded, did not deserve to be slightly deliver'd, and in general terms, but to be more narrowly conside&rehy;red, and likewise made out by Particu&rehy;lar Instances, whose applyableness and usefulness to explain divers obscure <RO>Ph&aelig;nomena</RO>, may hereafter appear much greater, then perchance at the first sight they will be thought.
</P><P>And the foregoing advertisement, with a light change, which 'tis presum'd the Reader may easily make of <CORR
SIC="im&rehy;self">him&rehy;self</CORR>, is to be extended to the Essay tacked to this <RO>about the Pores of So&rehy;lid Bodies</RO>, and so may excuse the ab&rehy;sence of a distinct Preface to it.</P></DIV></FRONT>

<HEAD>An Essay of the POROUSNESS OF <BO>ANIMAL BODIES</BO>.</HEAD>
<P>&Aic;S the most numerous part of the Pores of Bodies is too minute to be seen, so the Contemplation of them has been thought too inconsiderable to be regarded. But when I consider, how much most of the Qualities of Bo&rehy;dies, and consequently their operati&rehy;ons depend upon the structure of their minute, and singly invisible, par&rehy;ticles, and that to this latent contex&rehy;ture, the bigness the figure and the collocation of the Intervals and Pores <PB
N="2">do necessarily concur with the Size, Shape and Disposition or contrivance of the substantial parts I cannot but think the Doctrine of the small Pores of Bodies, of no small importance to Natural Philosophy. And I scarce doubt, but if such little things had not escaped the sight of our Illustrious <IT>Verulam</IT>, he would have afforded a good Porology (if I may so call it) a place, (and perhaps not the lowest nei&rehy;ther,) among his <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Desiderata</FOREIGN>.
</P><P>And, <IT>though</IT> other imployments and avocations hinder me from attempting to treat of this subject as am&rehy;ply and particularly as it deserveth, or even as I had design'd in a Scheme drawn diverse years since, and seen by some <IT>Virtuosi; Yet</IT>, not to leave apart of Physicks, that seems to me so curious and important, altogether as unculti&rehy;vated as I found it; I shall present you as many of the Notes I had drawn together about this subject, as I can conveniently (for I do not pretend to do it methodically) reduced to three heads: Whereof the first, which <PB
N="3">will challenge to it self this present es&rehy;say, is the <IT>porosity of Animal Bodies</IT>, about which I shall not be solicitous to marshal my observations, since they all conspire to shew but this one thing; That the parts of Ani&rehy;mals, especially whilest these are alive, are furnished with numerous Pores.</P>
<P>Those parts of the Bodies of Ani&rehy;mals, wherein their porosity may be best shewn seem to be their Mem&rehy;branes or Skins, the Bones, the Flesh, and Coagmentations of Membranes, Flesh and Juices. And therefore it would be proper enough to treat of these Heads distinctly, and give In&rehy;stances of each of them in particular. But yet I think it will be more conve&rehy;nient, to set down in order the princi&rehy;pal Fountains, whence the Porousness of the substances belonging to the Ani&rehy;mal Kingdom (as the Chymists speak) may be derived, and to annex to each of these the Experiments and obser&rehy;vations, upon which I argue from it, and which it will be easy to refer, if <PB
N="4">that be thought fit, to this or that of the parts above mentioned (namely the Membranes, Bones, <IT>&amp;c.</IT>) whereto they shall (respectively) appear the most properly to belong.</P>
&horbar;
<DIV N="I" TYPE="chapter"><HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He first thing from which I will deduce the Porosity we have been speaking of, is, the Frame or Constitution of the stable Parts of the Bodies of Animals. For the Bo&rehy;dy of an Animal being not a rude and indigested lump of matter, but a curi&rehy;ous engine, admirably framed and con&rehy;trived for the exercise of several Fun&rehy;ctions as Nutrition, Generation, Sensa&rehy;tion, and many differing local Motions, it was necessary that it should be fur&rehy;nished with variety of Dissimilar and Organical parts not only very Skil&rehy;fully, but very differingly, contrived congruous to the several uses for which they were designed, or if you please, to the several Functions they <PB
N="5">were to perform. And, because 'twill be easily granted, that the Corpuscles, that are skilfully brought together for such purposes, must be so contexed as not to touch one another exactly every where, it will readily follow that they must leave little Intervals or Pores between them, and that, considering the multitude of particles that must go to the making up the Body of the Animal, and the great difference and variety in point of bigness and figure of the Corpuscles that are requisite to contex such differing parts, as Membranes, Fibres Bones, Grizles, Ligaments, Veins, Ar&rehy;terys, Nerves, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> Both the number and the variety of the Pores cannot but be very great. This argument will be much confirmed, by what there will be occasion to say further to the same purpose, in the Essay touch&rehy;ing the Porosity of even Solid Bodies. Wherefore I shall now proceed to the Second thing, whence we may derive that of Animal Sub&rehy;stances.</P>
</DIV><PB N="6">&horbar;
<DIV N="II" TYPE="chapter"><HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;His is afforded us by consider&rehy;ing the Nutrition of Animals. For there being continually a great waste made of their substance, partly by the exclusion of visible excrements, and partly by the avolation of <CORR
SIC="invisibles">invisible</CORR> steam, this great loss must ne&rehy;cessarily from time to time be <CORR
SIC="repair&rehy;paired">repair&rehy;ed</CORR> by the supplies afforded by Nu&rehy;trition of which the best, if not the only Intelligible, way of giving an ac&rehy;count, is, to conceive that the alimental Juice, prepared chiefly in the Stomach is impelled or attracted (for to our present purpose it matters not which) to the parts of the Body that are to be nourished by it, and the Corpuscles of the juice insinuate themselves at those Pores they find commensurate to their Bigness, and Shape; and those that are <corr sic="must">most</corr> congruous, being assimilated, add to the substance of the part wherein <PB
N="7">they settle, and so make amends for the Consumption of those that were lost by that part before. This may be illustrated by what happens in Plants, and especially Trees, in which, of the various Corpuscles that are to be found in the liquors, that moisten the Earth, and are agitated by the heat of the Sun and the Air, those that happen to be commensurate to the Pores of the Root, are by their In&rehy;tervention impelled into it, or imbi&rehy;bed by it, and thence conveyed to the other parts of the Tree in the form of Sap which passing through new strai&rehy;ners, (whereby its Corpuscles are se&rehy;parated, and prepared or fitted to be detained in several parts) receives the alterations requisite to the being turned into Wood, Bark, Leaves, Blos&rehy;soms, Fruit, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> But to return to Ani&rehy;mals, our argument from their Nutri&rehy;tion will be much confirmed, by con&rehy;sidering, that in Children and in other young Animals, that have not yet at&rehy;tained their due Stature and Bulk, the Nutrition is so copious as to amount <PB
N="8">to a continu'd Augmentation. For, as 'tis evident that Animals grow in all their parts, and each part according to all its Dimensions, in so much that even the cavities of Bones increase; so we cannot well conceive how this can be done, unless the Nutritive liquor be distributed through the whole Bo&rehy;dy of the part that is to be nou&rehy;rished and augmented. And to this distribution 'tis requisite that the Body abound with Pores into which the congruous particles of the Juice may be intimatly admitted, & penetrating even into the innermost recesses, may place or lodge themselves in the man&rehy;ner that is most convenient for the Na&rehy;tural Increase of the part. But the more particular Declaration of this Process I leave to Anatomists and Physicians.</P>

<P>&Hic;Aving premis'd once for all, that in this Essay, I often use the word Skin in the lax and popular sense of it, <PB
N="9">without nicely distinguishing the <IT>Epi&rehy;dermis</IT> or <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cuticula</FOREIGN>, called in English the <IT>Scarf-skin</IT>, from the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Cutis</FOREIGN></IT> it invests and sticks closely to; I shall proceed to another Topic, whence the Porous&rehy;ness of Animals may be argued, name&rehy;ly, the great plenty of matter that is daily carried off by Sweat, and insensible Transpiration. For, 'tis con&rehy;fest that Sweat is discharged at the Pores of the skin; and since there is no penetration of Dimensions, we may safely conclude, that the matter that is not wasted by Sweat, or by any o&rehy;ther sensible way of evacuation, must have small Pores or out-lets in the Skin, at which it may issue in the form of steams; though nothing hinders but that invisible <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN></IT> also may evapo&rehy;rate at the same Pores with the Sweat, though for want of plenty or grossness, or a fit disposition in the ambient, those <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN> be not at the Orifices of those pores brought into little Drops, such as those of sweat.
</P><P>That therefore the Skins of a mul&rehy;titude of Animals, though they seem <PB
N="10">close to the eye, may be porous, may (as we have been saying) be argued in many of them from their sweating. But because all of them have not been observed to sweat, as is wont to be particularly affirmed of Dogs, we shall add some other Instances to make it probable.</P>
<P>We may sometimes, in the smooth skin of a living man, discern Pores with good Microscopes, and, with one that is none of the best, we may easily on the inside of gloves, which are made but of skins drest, discern good store of these little out-lets: Some&rehy;times orderly enough ranged to make the sight not unpleasant. And though some of them may, I think, be su&rehy;spected to have been made by the Hairs that grew on the skin before 'twas drest, yet that greater numbers of them, than can be supposed to come from thence, are perforations that pass quite through the Leather, may, not improbably, be shewn by the usual Practice of Chymists, to purify Quick-silver by tying it up strictly <PB
N="11">in a piece of kids or sheeps Leather, and then wringing it hard to force it out; by which means the lower surface of the Leather will be covered with a Mercurial Dew or Sweat which will fall down and fly out, as the Pores happen to open this or that way, in a thick shower of globules, leaving the dross behind in the Leather. And tho when a mans skin is tanned it is of a greater thickness then one would expect, and that which I employed seem'd almost as thick as a Buck skin Glove yet having had the curiosity to try the same Experiment with the skin of a mans Arm, I found the Quick Sil&rehy;ver would be squeez'd out at the Pores of that also. 'Tis not necessary that I should here inquire, whether the lit&rehy;tle holes, unperceiv'd by the naked Eye, at which the Sweat is discharged, and perhaps the matter that the Body looses by insensible transpiration gets out, be not, at least most of them, the Orifices of small excretory vessels, belonging to those very numerous glandules which the excellent Anato<PB
N="12">mists <IT>Steno and Malpighi</IT> are said to have discovered beneath the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cuticula</FOREIGN>, and which for their smalness and shape have been called <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Glandul&aelig; miliares</FOREIGN></IT>. I need not, I say, engage in this inquiry, since according to this ingenious opi&rehy;nion also, the Skin must be allow'd a multitude of small Perforations or Pores, and that is sufficient for my pur&rehy;pose, from whencesoever this Porosity proceeds in a mans Skin. For the next observation will shew that some mem&rehy;branes of Animals may give passage to transpir'd matter without being perfo&rehy;rated by the excretory Vessels of Glan&rehy;dules.</P>
<P>The Membranes or Skins under the shells of Hens Eggs, though they be very thin, are of a Contexture very fine and close as may be confirmed by their resisting the sharp Corpuscles of Vinegar; and yet, that not only these Skins, but the shells that cover them, are porous, may be inferred from the Experiments I made, of keeping them suspended for a good while, and care&rehy;fully counterpoised in good scales; <PB
N="13">for by these it appeared, that the Eggs did from time to time manifestly lose in weight; which could not reasonably be imputed but to an invisible Tran&rehy;spiration, the rather, because usually in eggs that have been kept long, there will be at one end a cavity which is wont to increase with their age, and is made by the shrinking of the Membrane from the Shell, to ac&rehy;comodate it self to the diminished quantity of matter, that remains to be involved by it.</P>
<P>When I consider the plenty of mat&rehy;ter, that is wont to be discharged dai&rehy;ly by insensible Perspiration, especial&rehy;ly in Healthful men that exercise them&rehy;selves moderately, I cannot but think it probable, that the minute Pores, that suffice for the carrying off so much matter, are very numerous, and are much more so than even by the multitude of drops of sweat, that serve to wet the skin, men are wont to imagine. For <IT>Sanctorius</IT> in his ex&rehy;cellent little Tract <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">de Medicina stati&rehy;ca</FOREIGN> affirms, that what is barely car<PB
N="14">ryed off by insensible transpiration does ordinarily amount to more, that is, diminishes more the weight of a mans Body, than all the visible ex&rehy;crements (whether gross or liquid) put together. <IT>Aph. vt.</IT> He adds, If the meat and Drink, taken in one day, a&rehy;mount to the weight of eight pound, the insensible Transpiration ordinarily amounts to five pounds or thereabouts. And elsewhere says, that sometimes in the space of 24 hours, in the Win&rehy;ter time, a healthy Body may ex&rehy;hale fifty ounces or more. And some Tryals, that I have carefully made up&rehy;on my self, added to some others of a very curious as well as great Prince, that made use of a like instrument, & did me the honour to acquaint me with the events, gave me no cause to reject <IT>Sanctorius</IT>'s observations, considering the difference in point of heat, between the climate of <IT>Italy</IT>, where he writ, and that of <IT>England</IT>, where ours were made; only I fear, there has been com&rehy;mitted an oversight by those many that ascribe all the decrement of <PB
N="15">weight, that is not referrable to the grosser Excrements, to what transpires at the Pores of the visible parts of the skin, without taking notice of that great plenty of steams that is in expi&rehy;rations discharged through the Wind&rehy;pipe by the Lungs, and appear manifest to the Eye it self in frosty weather; though they may be presumed to be then less copious than those Invisible ones that are emitted in Summer, when the ambient Air is much war&rehy;mer. But <IT>though</IT> I look upon the Wind&rehy;pipe as the great Chimney of the Bo&rehy;dy in comparison of those little Chimneys (if I may so call them) in the Skin, at which the matter that is wasted by perspiration is emitted, <IT>yet</IT> the number of these little vents is so very great, that the fuliginous Ex&rehy;halations that steal out at them, can&rehy;not but be very considerable. Besides that, those that are discharged at the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Aspera Arteria</FOREIGN></IT>, do probably, at least for the most part, issue out at the la&rehy;tent Pores of the Membranes that in&rehy;vest the Lungs; which membranes <PB
N="16">may be lookt upon as external parts of the Body, in reference to the air, tho not in reference to our sight. But, to return to our Eggs, we may safely al&rehy;low a very great evacuation to be made at the Pores of the skin in man, who is a sanguineous and hot Ani&rehy;mal, since we see that even Eggs, that are still actually cold, transpire. And I elsewhere mention the copious transpi&rehy;ration even of Frogs, that are always cold to the touch; and the Decrement in weight of some Animals, soon after they are strangled or suffocated, when, their vital Heat being extinct, no more fumes are emitted by expirations at the wind-Pipe: To which signs may be added the trivial experiment of holding in warm weather the palp of ones Finger, as near as one can without contact, to some cold & solid smooth body, as to a piece of polished Steel or Silver; for you will often times see this Body presently sullyed or overcast, with the invisible steams that issue out of the Pores of the Fin&rehy;ger, and are by the cold and smooth <PB
N="17">surface of the Body condensed in&rehy;to visible steams, that do as 'twere cloud that surface, but upon the Removal of the Finger, quickly fly off, and leave it bright again.</P>
<P>The Perviousness of the skin out&rehy;wards may not improbably be argued from the quickness wherewith some Medicines take away some black and blew Discolorations of the skin, that happen upon some lighter stroke, or other contusions. For, since these pre&rehy;ternatural and unsightly colours are wont by Physicians to be imputed to some small portions of blood, that upon the contusion is forced out of the capillary vessels that lye beneath the surface of it, & being extravasated are obliged to stagnate there; it seems very likely, that if a powerful Medi&rehy;cine do quickly remove the discolora&rehy;tion, that work is performed by attenu&rehy;ating, and dissolving, and agitating the matter, and disposing it to transpire through the cutaneous Pores, though perhaps, when 'tis thus changed, some part of it may be imbibed again by <PB
N="18">the Capillary Vessels, and so by the circulation carryed into the mass of Blood. Now, that there are Medicines that will speedily work upon such black and blew marks, the Books and Practice of Physicians and Chirurge&rehy;ons will oblige us to admit. <IT>Helmont</IT> talks much of the great vertue of white Briony root in such cases. And a no&rehy;table Experiment made a while ago by a Learned acquaintence of mine in an odd case, did not give <IT>Hel&rehy;mont</IT> the Lye. And I know an emi&rehy;nent Person, who having some while since received a stroke, by a kick of an Horse, on his Leg, a very threat&rehy;ning contusion, which made the part look black and frightful, he was in a few hours cured of the pain of the hurt, and freed from the black part of the Discoloration by the bare ap&rehy;plication of the chopt leaves of Hissop mixt with fresh Butter into the form of a Pultess.</P>
<P>Nor is it only the Skin that covers the visible parts of the body that we judg to be thus porous, but in the Mem<PB
N="19">branes that invest the internal parts, we may reasonably suppose both nu&rehy;merous and very various Pores, ac&rehy;cording to the exigency of their pe&rehy;culiar and different Functions or Offi&rehy;ces. For, the two first causes of Poro&rehy;sity mention'd in this Essay, are as well applicable to the Membranes that cover the internal parts, as the Liver, the Spleen, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> as to the exter&rehy;nal Skin, or Membrane that covers the Limbs; and in some respects the transpiration through such Pores seems more advantaged, than that through the Pores of the surface of the Body; since the parts that environ the Spleen, Liver, Kidneys, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> in man, are hot in comparison of the ambient Air, and being also wet, which the Air is not, the laxity of the Pores of the internal parts is doubly befriended. And perhaps it may be allowable to conceive, both the Skin that covers the Limbs, and the Mem&rehy;branes that invest the internal parts of the Body, to be like worsted stock&rehy;ings, Wast-Coats, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> Which in their <PB
N="20">ordinary state have a kind of continu&rehy;ity, but upon occasion can have their Pores every way enlarged and stretch&rehy;ed, in this or that manner, as the A&rehy;gents that work on them determine them to be. This may be confirmed, by what we manifestly see in the fi&rehy;ner sort of leather, as that of Kid or Lamb, and by the latent Pores that may be opened in Sheeps Leather, and mans Leather, by the pressure of in&rehy;cluded Quick-Silver.</P>
<P>This Porosity of a living mans Skin and other Membranes, though inter&rehy;nal ones, will the more easily be assen&rehy;ted to if it appear that such thick and gross Membranes, as the urinary blad&rehy;ders of dead Animals, are Porous and Penetrable even by Water. This we tryed, by putting some salt of Tartar in a clean well dryed bladder (which ought to be afterwards tyed up close in the neck, lest the effect should be ascribed to the moist Air) and leaving the lower part of the blad&rehy;der as far as the Salt, reached immer&rehy;sed in common Water, whose parti&rehy;<PB
N="21">cles by degrees insinuated themselves into the Pores of the bladder, in plenty enough to resolve the Salt of Tartar into a liquor. And, that it may not be said that the Acrimony of the Salt, by fretting the bladder, made way for the Corpuscles of the Water, I shall add that the Experiment suc&rehy;ceeded, but much more slowly, when we tryed it with Sugar instead of Salt of Tartar. And there are some, who pretend that certain Sy&rehy;rups made this slovenly way, which they would have pass for a secret, are very much preferable to those made of common Water.</P>
<P>That the films that line the shells of Eggs are of a very close Contexture seems probable, as by other things, so by their resisting some liquors, sharp enough to corrode the shell, and yet that such Membranes are pervious to Liquors that are none of the most sub&rehy;tile of all, we found by the ensuing Ex&rehy;periment. This was made by taking an ordinary Hens Egg, and keeping it for two or three days in distill'd Vinegar, <PB
N="22">or in strong crude Vinegar. For then taking it out of the Liquor and wiping it well, it was visibly, and not incon&rehy;siderably, swell'd, which I concluded to be from the ingress of some parti&rehy;cles of the liquors, at the Pores of the Skins that invest the White of the Egg. For we found nothing broken, though we made the Tryal more than once. And to be satisfied that the manifest expansion proceeded from some other cause, than the meer dilata&rehy;tion of the White, or Yolk, or both, we compared the weight of the Egg, af&rehy;ter it was taken out and well wiped, with that which had been taken be&rehy;fore 'twas put into the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Menstruum</FOREIGN>, and found the Egg, notwithstanding the loss of the Shell, to be considerably heavier than 'twas before its immer&rehy;sion.</P>
<P>I shall add on this occasion that by a more unlikely way than that newly recited, both the Egg, Shell and Lining of an Egg, may be penetrated. For, not&rehy;withstanding the fine and close con&rehy;texture of the Membranes, that invest <PB
N="23">the Eggs, the <IT>Chineses</IT> have a way of Salting them in the shell, as I have been assured both by English and Dutch Merchants trading to the East <IT>Indies</IT>. And in one of the Dutch Jour&rehy;nals sent by the Council of <IT>Batavia</IT> to their Principals in <IT>Holland</IT>, and in&rehy;tercepted by an English man of War, I met with divers accounts of great numbers of salted Eggs, that were such or such a day of such a Month brought in by Sea to <IT>Batavia</IT> or other Ports. Long after which time, meet&rehy;ing with an ingenious Physician, that liv'd in <IT>Batavia</IT>, I learned by enquiry from him, that 'tis very true that such Eggs are frequently met with in those parts; he having divers times eaten of them there; some that he judged to have been either boyled or roasted, before they were salted; and others that were raw, when they came to be dressed for him, but yet remained a Briny tast. And, though the Mer&rehy;chants I enquired of could not tell me what way the <IT>Chineses</IT> employed to Salt their Eggs, without making them <PB
N="24">unfit for common use, yet by a tryal made with clay and Brine, in which I kept the Eggs for a competent time, I was perswaded that 'twas possible the <IT>Chineses</IT> should have the Art ascribed to them. For upon the breaking of an Egg coated with clay, after it had lain for a competent time in Brine, I found its Tast considerably Salt, but was, by I know not what accident, hindered from prosecuting the Experiment, and endeavouring to make it more practi&rehy;cable and useful.</P>
<P>I knew a Physitian of more lear&rehy;ning than vertue, who, being torme&rehy;nted with a violent and obstinate Colic of a peculiar kind, was wont to re&rehy;lieve himself by Clisters of Sack; th&ocirc; he usually found that not long after he had taken any of them, they would make him giddy, and fuddle him, as he himself confessed to me. But upon this Instance I lay not much weight, and less upon what was answered me by a great Chirur&rehy;geon, who having practised his Art in the <IT>West-Indies</IT>, and being asked <PB
N="25">by me whether he had not dressed Wounds and Ulcers with the recent juice of Tobacco (a plant I use to keep growing in my Garden for its excel&rehy;lent vertues in cuts, burns, and tumors;) and whether, if he employed it, he did not find it emetick, he told me among other things, that having Di&rehy;vers times dressed with this Juice a small Ulcer in a Womans leg, the pa&rehy;tient soon after the application would grow sick, and have her stomack tur&rehy;ned, or actually vomit. But, as I was saying, on this instance I lay no stress, because the Corpuscles of the Tobacco might probably enough get in at the small Orifices of some corroded Ves&rehy;sels, and so be conveyed inwards, ra&rehy;ther by the help of the Circulation of the blood, than on the account of the porousness of the Parts. And therefore I shall rather mention what has been related to me, by an eminent Phy&rehy;sician of the famous Colledge of <IT>London</IT>, namely, that he had divers times given himself a vomit, by a certain application of decocted Tobacco to <PB
N="26">his wrists, and some other external parts; which brings into my mind, what is affirmed to have been obser&rehy;ved in some Children that have scabb'd Heads, who have been made Drunk, by the application of Clothes or spun&rehy;ges wetted in Infusion of Tobacco, or of strong Liquors, and applied to the part affected. Though in this case the inebriating Particles may be suspected to have got in, not at the meer Pores, but rather at the Orifices of the Capil&rehy;lary Vessels, that were made accessible by such little solutions of Continui&rehy;ty, as are seldom wanting in scabbed Heads.</P>
<P>That Children may be purged by outward applications is asserted by some Physicians; and an experienced Person of that number has affirmed to me, that he can almost constantly do it by a Plaister. But 'tis more con&rehy;siderable what was related to me by an eminent <IT>Virtuoso</IT>, who being in&rehy;disposed to believe such things a while before he told me the story, was de&rehy;sired by a curious Person to shew him <PB
N="27">his Hand which the Relator having done the other took it in his hand, which was moistened (as was after&rehy;wards confessed) with a kind of sub&rehy;tile Chymical Oil, but so slightly, that the Relator scarce minded it, till some time after when he found himself prest with a motion, like that which a purge would have given him; for the other thereupon smiling, my acquaintance began to suspect what the matter might be, and was in a short time purged four times, without griping, or other pain or discomposure. But to re&rehy;turn to the Porousness of Membranes, it may serve to make way for your admitting it, to observe, that <IT>though</IT> Lute-strings be but Ropes of Fibres (which are at least the chief parts that Membranes consist of) dead, cold and stiff, <IT>yet</IT> when the lute is in tune they will sometimes in wet weather swell so forcibly as with noise and violence to break, which proceeds from the copi&rehy;ous ingress of moist vapors into their Pores, whereby they are not only shortened, but as I have tryed in <PB
N="28">nice scales, made manifestly heavier.</P>
<P>The Porosity of the internal parts of Animals by both the foremention'd ways (<IT>viz.</IT> of emission and reception of Corpuscles,) may be confirmed by the things that happen in some of the <IT>Metastases</IT> or Translations (as the Physitians call them) of the morbifick matter in diseased Bodies. 'Tis known to them that are any thing conversant with Hospitals, or the observations of Physicians, that there do not seldom occur in Diseases sudden Removes of the matter that caused them, from one part to another according to the na&rehy;ture and functions of which, there may emerge a new Disease, more or less dangerous than the former, as the invaded part is more or less noble. Thus oftentimes the matter, which in the sanguiferous Vessels produced a Feaver, being discharged upon some internal parts of the Head, produces a <IT>Delirium</IT> or <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Phrenitis</FOREIGN>; in the latter of which I have somewhat wondered, to see the Patients Water so like that of a Person without a Feaver; the same <FW
TYPE="catch">Febril</FW> <PB N="29">Febrile matter either by a deviation of Nature, or medicines improper or unskillfully given, is discharged sometimes upon the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Pleura</FOREIGN></IT>, or Membrane that lines the sides of the Chest; sometimes upon the throat; sometimes up&rehy;on the Guts; and causes in the first case a Pleurisie, in the 2d a Squinancy, and in the third a Flux, for the most part dysenterical. But, because I suppose, that many, if not most, of these trans&rehy;lations of peccant humors, are made by the help of the circulation of the Blood, I forebore at the beginning of this Section to speak in <IT>general terms</IT>, when I mentioned them in reference to the Porousness of the internal parts of the Body, and contented my self to intimate, that <IT>some</IT> of them may serve to confirm that Porosity.</P>
<P>This will not perhaps seem impro&rehy;bable, if we consider that 'tis in effect already proved, by the same argu&rehy;ments by which we have shewn, that both the Skin and the internal Mem&rehy;branes are furnished with Pores, Per&rehy;meable by Particles whose Shape and <PB
N="30">Size are correspondent to them. For we may thence probably deduce, that when a morbifick matter, whether in the form of Liquor, or of exha&rehy;lations, chances to have Corpuscles suited to the Pores of this or that part of the Body, it may, by a concourse of Circumstances, be determined to in&rehy;vade it, and so dislodge from its for&rehy;mer receptacle, and excite Disorders in the part it removes to.</P>

<P>&Aic;Nother thing whence the Po&rehy;rosity of Animals may be ar&rehy;gued, is, their taking in of <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN> from without. For these cannot get into the internal parts of the Body, to perform their operations there, with&rehy;out penetrating the Skin, and conse&rehy;quently entring the Pores of it.
</P><P>Now, That things, outwardly applyed to the Body, may without wound&rehy;ing the Skin, be convey'd to the inter&rehy;nal parts, there are many things that argue.</P>
<PB N="31"><P>And first, it has been observed in some Persons, (for all are not equal&rehy;ly disposed to admit the action of par&rehy;ticular Poysons) that <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cantharides</FOREIGN>, be&rehy;ing externally apply'd by Chyrurgions or Physicians, may soon, and before they break the Skin, produce great disorders in the Urinary Passages, and sometimes cause bloody Water. And I remember, that having once had a blistering Plaister, applyed by a skil&rehy;ful Chyrurgion between my shoulders, though I knew not that there were any <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Cantharides</FOREIGN></IT> at all mixt with the other Ingredients, yet it gave me about the neck of my Bladder one of the sensiblest pains I had ever felt, and forced me to send for help at a very unseasonable time of night.
</P><P>The Porousness of the Skin may be also argued from divers of the ef&rehy;fects even of Milder Plaisters. For, though some Plaisters may operate as they closely stick to the Skin, and hinder Perspiration from within, and fence the part from the external cold; yet, twill scarce be denied, that <PB
N="32">many of them have notable effects up&rehy;on other accounts, whereof none is so likely and considerable as the copi&rehy;ous ingress of the Corpuscles of the Plaister, that enter at the Pores of the Skin, and being once got in, act ac&rehy;cording to their respective Natures & Vertues. The like may be said of Ointments, whose operations, especi&rehy;ally on Children (whose Skin is ordinarily more soft and lax) are sometimes very notable. And I have known considerable things performed by them, in an internal Disease of grown men, where I should scarce have expected a Vegetable Ointment should perform so much: I say, a Ve&rehy;getable Ointment, for 'tis vulgarly known that by Mercurial Ointments Salivation may be excited; and some&rehy;times, against the Physitians will, the Corpuscles of the Quick Silver get so far into the Body, that he is not able to get them out again.</P>
<P>What we lately said of Plaisters, may be applyed to those that Physi&rehy;tians call <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Pericarpia</FOREIGN>, or Wrist-bands: <PB N="33">The better sort of which, though sometimes ineffectual, are oftentimes successful in stopping Fits or Agues, as I have frequently found in a mixture, elsewhere mention'd, of Currans, Hops, Baysalt well beaten together, by which, by Gods blessing, many, and I among others, have been freed from simple Tertians, and either double Ter&rehy;tians or Quotidians.</P>
<P>The Argument of the Porosity of Animals, drawn from those things that get in through their skins, without breaking or wounding them, may be much strengthned, if it can be made appear, that those Physitians do not deceive us, who ascribe sensi&rehy;ble Operations and Vertues, to things externally applyed, in so loose a way, that they do not so much as stick to the Skin, or perhaps immediately touch it; such as some call <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Periapta</FOREIGN> and <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Appensa</FOREIGN></IT>; divers of which are best known among us, by the name of Amulets; such as are the Quills con&rehy;taining Quick-silver or Arsenick, that some hang about their necks, and <PB
N="34">wear under their Shirts, against the Plague and other Contagious Dis&rehy;eases; and the Bloodstones that others wear against H&aelig;morrhages; and the stone which the Women use in the <IT>East Indies</IT>, for a quite contrary effect, in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Obstructione Mensium</FOREIGN></IT>. That many of these external Medicines, answer not the promises of those that extol them, having some of them no sen&rehy;sible operation at all, and others no considerable one, experience has as&rehy;sured judicious observers; but that some of them, especially on some Patients, may have considerable, not to say admirable, operations, I confess my self by other motives, as well as Authority, to be perswaded. Hav&rehy;ing been one summer frequently sub&rehy;ject to bleed at the Nose, and reduced to imploy several remedies to check that distemper; that which I found the most effectual to stanch the blod, was some moss of a dead mans Scull (sent for a present out of <IT>Ireland</IT> where 'tis far less rare than in most other Countrys) though it did but <PB
N="35">touch my skin till the herb was a little warm'd by it. And though I remember not that I have known any great matter done to stop H&aelig;morrha&rehy;gies by the bare outward application of other Blood-stones; yet of one that look'd almost like an Agate, I admired the effects, especially upon a young and extraordinarily Sanguin person. To which I shall add a memorable thing, communicated to the experienced <IT>Zwelfer</IT> by the chief Physitian of the States of <IT>Moravia</IT>. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="inline" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>If one would see this passage at large he may find it at the end of the Essay</IT>.</NOTE> For this learned man whom he extols for a great Physician and Philosopher; assures him, that having prepared some Trochischs of Toads according to <IT>Helmonts</IT> way, (which I remember I also was solici&rehy;tous to prepare, but had not occasion to make tryal of their vertue,) he not only found, that being worn as Amu&rehy;lets they preserved him and all his Domesticks, and Friends, from the Plague (though he daily visited the infected) but that having caused these <PB
N="36">Trochischs to be put upon the Plague sores of several persons, none of them died, but the venom of the pestilential Carbuncles was thereby so weakened that the ulcers were afterward easily cured by vulgar remedies.</P>
<P>And now, as to the difficulty, which I acknowledge not to be small, to conceive how Bodies actually cold can emit <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN>, capable of pene&rehy;trating (without moistening it) a Membrane of so close a Contexture as a mans Skin; I suppose it will be much lessened in the objectors opinion, by what he will meet with hereafter about the Pores of Bodies, and the Figures of Corpuscles. For supposing these to be congruous, it will not seem incredible, that the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN></IT> of Amu&rehy;lets should in tract of time get passage through the Pores of the Skin of a Living Body. And to make this the more probable, I will give an Instance in the Skin of a dead <IT>Animal</IT>. And, because this requires a Liquor I much employ in these trials about Porology, though I have many years since in <PB
N="37">another Tract taught how to make it for another purpose; yet I shall here repeat, that 'tis made by exactly ming&rehy;ling Flower of Brimstone, powdered <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Sal Armoniac</FOREIGN></IT> and good Quicklime in equal quantities, save that, if the Quicklime be not very dry and good, a fourth or fifth part must be super&rehy;added, for these being nimbly mixed, and distilled by degrees of Fire in a Retort, till the Sand be at length brought to be almost red hot, there will come over a smoaking Spirit, which must be kept very carefully stopt, and which for distinctions sake, I also use to call, The <IT>Permeating Menstruum or Liquor</IT>, and its expi&rehy;rations the Penetrant, or Permeating Fumes.</P>
<P>And now you will easily under&rehy;stand the experiment I was about to mention, which was this; We took a very clean piece of polish&rehy;'d Copper, in want of which one of silver will serve the turn, and having lapt it up in a piece of either Lambs or sheeps Leather, so that it was every way <PB
N="38">inclosed, we then held it over the Orifice of the Vial that contained the Spirit, at a pretty distance from the Liquor whose fumes nevertheless did quickly, (perhaps in a minute of an hour or less) pervade the Pores of the Leather, and operate upon the inclu&rehy;ded metal as appeared by the deep and lasting tincture it had given to the lower surface of it, though the interposed Leather it self was not deprived of its whiteness, nor at all sen&rehy;sibly discoloured; however it smelt of the <CORR
SIC="Sulplureous">Sulphureous</CORR> steams that had in&rehy;vaded it. And, if I misremember not, the same Experiment succeeded, though somewhat more slowly, when a double Leather was interposed between the fumes and a new piece of Copper coin. This will be thought the less strange, when I shall come to some other Instances of the Penetrancy of these Spirits. In the mean while I leave it to be considered, whether this may not suggest some conjecture at that strange <IT>Ph&oelig;nomenon</IT>, which is recorded by Authors of good repute, <PB
N="39">That sometimes in great Thunders the Lightening, among other opera&rehy;tions, has been found to have mani&rehy;festly discoloured mens money, with&rehy;out burning the Purses or Pockets wherein it lay. For in our experiment, the steams that in a trice pervaded the Leather, the most usual matter where&rehy;of Purses are made, were sulphureous, as the smell argues, that those which accompany the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Fulmen</FOREIGN> are wont to be; and whereas these, when they invade Bodies, are usually very hot, ours operated when the Liquor that emitted them was actually cold. And if it be said, that sometimes their mo&rehy;ney has been found discolored in their Pockets, who were not struck, by the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Fulmen</FOREIGN></IT>, but had it only pass near them, it may be objected, that tho the intire Body, whether fluid or so&rehy;lid, if there be any of this latter kind that is in Latine called <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Fulmen</FOREIGN></IT> (for our English word, <IT>Thunderbolt</IT> seems not so applicable to a fluid) did not touch them, yet it might scatter steams enough round about it, to cause <PB
N="40">the <IT>Ph&aelig;nomenon</IT>. For confirmation of which I shall take notice, that a con&rehy;siderable Person of my acquaintance, having had the Curiosity to ascend a burning mountain in <IT>America</IT>, till the sulphureous steams grew too offensive to him, he told me that, among other operations he observed them to have upon him, one was, that he found the money he had about him turned of a black and dirty colour, such as I have observed our sulphureous steams of&rehy;ten give both to Copper, and to Silver Coins. But whether or no our Spirits will justify the conjecture, they invi&rehy;ted me to mention, at least their so easily pervading the Skin of a dead Ani&rehy;mal may make it probable, that the Skin of a Living man may be easily pe&rehy;netrated by external steams whose ap&rehy;proach the Eye does not perceive, and whose operations, though not inconsi&rehy;derable, may therefore be unsuspected. I leave to Physitians to consider, what use may be made of this observation, in reference to the propagation of contagious Diseases, by the contact of <PB
N="41">infected Air, distinct from the Respi&rehy;ration of it, and by the penetration of the steams, that issuing from divers Bodies invade the Skin, and may perhaps be capable of operations, either hurtful or friendly, that are not usually suspected to proceed from such causes, and are therefore misa&rehy;scribed to others. And on this occasion it will not be impertinent to add, that by hanging up sheeps Leather or Lambs Leather in the free Air, the vapors of it would so insinuate themselves into the Pores in wet weather, that a moderate degree of moisture in the Air would add to it a not inconsiderable weight, of which dry weather, whether hot or cold, would deprive it.</P>

</P><P>Among the observations published by Physicians I have met with some by which it appears that <FOREIGN

<P>We see, that in Linnen Cloth, the <PB N="43">finer and more slender the threads are the closer and less Porous, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">c&aelig;teris paribus</FOREIGN>, the Linnen is: By analogy to which one may esteem the thin film that lines the shell of an Egg, to be of an exceeding close Contexture; and yet that even this film is not imper&rehy;vious to some Fumes, I have found by the following Tryal.</P>
<P>To make this, we slowly and warily pick'd off a sufficient part of the Shell of a Hens Egg, from the Skin that lay just beneath it, and is wont to stick so close to it, that their separation, without injuring the Membrane, is not easy. In this Skin, being wip'd, we wrapt up a flat piece of Copper, whose surface was made bright, that the change of Colour might be the better seen; and having kept this covered bit of Plate, over the Fumes of our smoaking Li&rehy;quor lately mentioned for a minute or two by our ghess we unfolded the Skin, and found, as we expected, that the lower surface of the Copper which was it that had been held over the <PB
N="44">Fumes, was turned of a very dark co&rehy;lour, which manifested that even so fine and closely contexed a Mem&rehy;brane was not only, as we have for&rehy;merly shewn, penetrable by Li&rehy;quors, but readily pervious to our sulphureous exhalations, tho these were probably but faintly emitted, since the Liquor they came from was then actually cold. But in making the Tryal it is fit to hold (as we did that newly recited) the Mem&rehy;brane against the light, to see if it be intire, and have escaped all those little lacerations that are hardly avoidable in severing it from the Shell it sticks so close to. If this caution be neg&rehy;lected, 'tis easy to be imposed on, by overlooking some little holes, that are not easily discerned when one looks down upon the Skin, and yet may be sufficient to make the Expe&rehy;riment deceitful. But, th&ocirc; when 'tis well made, it is a notable confirmation of the Doctrine endeavoured to be established in this Paper, yet I shall now subjoyn a more considerable <PB
N="45">Instance to the same purpose.</P>
<P>The Porousness of the Internal Membranes of the Body, will be more easily granted, if it be considered that either the Liquors, or the moist Exhalations, whose Action is pro&rehy;moted by the Natural Heat of the Parts, keeps them constantly wet or moist, and thereby renders them more lax, and more penetrable by subtle Spirits or other Corpuscles. In favour of this Reflection I made the follow&rehy;ing Experiment. We took a piece of a dryed Urinary Bladder, which was judged to have been a Calfs; and having lapt it about a new piece of Silver Coin, so that the Bladder was single where it covered the lower side of the Piece, we kept it for divers Minutes, by guess, over the Spirituous Fumes of our often mentioned Per&rehy;meating Liquor, but could not per&rehy;ceive that the Coin was thereby at all affected or ternished. Whence we concluded that the Pores of the dry Bladder were too close and narrow, to give passage to the Expirations of <PB
N="46">the <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Menstruum</FOREIGN>. But presuming that moisture would some what relax them with another piece of the same Bladder, made limber by being a little wetted in common Water, we lapt up another like peace of new Coin, as we had done the former, and kept it at the same distance as before, from the Liquor, but not for so long a time. For after about two Minutes, by guess, we remov'd and took out the Piece, and, as we ex&rehy;pected, found much of its lower sur&rehy;face (that regarded the Liquor) deeply discoloured. Which Experi&rehy;ment will not only justify what I lately said, of the greater Laxity of moist than of dry Membranes, but will be thought no mean confirma&rehy;tion of what is in this Essay delivered about the porosity of Membranes, since the Urinary Bladder does, as Anatomists well know, consist of more than one Membrane, though they stick so close together, as to ap&rehy;pear but one to the Eye. And this Bladder was speedily penetrated by <PB
N="47">the Fumes that our Liquor emitted in exceeding Cold and Frosty weather, though the Bladder it self was not in the warm Body of the live Animal, but had been so long kept dryed and cold, that probably the Moisture it introduced in scarce one minute of an Hour, could not restore it to the Laxity it had, whilst it was a part of the living Calf.</P>
<P>One of the notablest Instances I ever met with, of the Porosity of the In&rehy;ternal Membranes of the Humane Body, was afforded me by that <IT>British</IT> Nobleman, of whom our fa&rehy;mous <IT>Harvey</IT> tells a memorable, not to say matchless, story. This Gen&rehy;tleman, having in his youth, by an accident which that Doctor relates, had a great and lasting Perforation made in his <IT>Thorax</IT>, at which the motion of his Heart could be directly perceiv'd did not only out live the accident, but grew a strong, and somewhat corpulent man; and so robust, as well as Gallant, that he afterwards was a Souldier, and had <PB
N="48">the honour to command a Body of an Army for the King. This Earl of <IT>Mount-Alexander</IT> (for that was his last Title having mar&rehy;ryed one of my nearest kinswomen, and having been told that I was very desirous to see, what I had heard such strange things of, very obliging&rehy;ly came, at a fit time, to give me that satisfaction. In order to which he removed that which covered the wide Orifice of his Hurt, and gave me the opportunity of looking into his <IT>Thorax</IT>, and of discerning there the motions of the Cone, as they call it, or <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Mucro</FOREIGN> of the Heart. But these things I mention but upon the by, and be&rehy;cause of the strangeness of the fact; the thing I principally intended relates to my present argument. Having then made several inquiries fit for my pur&rehy;pose, his Lordship told me, that when he did, as he was wont to do from time to time, (though not every day) inject with a Syringe some actually warm medicated Liquor into his <IT>Thorax</IT>, to cleanse and cherish the <PB
N="49">Parts, he should quickly and plainly find in his Mouth the tast and smell of the Drugs, wherewith the Liquor had been impregnated. And I further learned, that, whereas he constantly wore upon the unclosed part of his Chest, a Silken quilt, stuffed with Aromatick and odorife&rehy;rous Powders, to defend the neigh&rehy;bouring Parts and keep them warm; when he came, as he used to do after some weeks, to imploy a new Quilt, the fragrant <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN></IT> of it would min&rehy;gle with his breath in exspiration, and very sensibly perfume it, not, as I declared I suspected, upon the score of the pleasing Exhalations that might get up between his Clothes and his Body, but that got into the Organs of Respiration, and came out with his Breath at his Mouth, as was confirmed to me by a grave & judicious States&rehy;man, that happened to be then pre&rehy;sent, and knew this General very well. Other circumstances I might add, but that I dare not trust my memory for them, and unhappily lost the paper, <PB
N="50">wherein the oddness of the things in&rehy;vited me to set them down, for fear of forgetting them.</P>
<P>That part of this Narrative which relates to Injections may be much confirm'd by what is delivered by <IT>Galen</IT> himself, who says that <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Mulsum</FOREIGN> or <IT>Honeyed Water</IT>, being injected at the Orifice of Wounds penetrating into the cavity of the <IT>Thorax</IT>, has been observed to be in part received into the Lungs, and discharged out of the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Aspera Arteria</FOREIGN></IT> by coughing. And this he mentions as a known thing, imploying it as a <IT>Medium</IT> whereby to prove another.</P>
<P>The mention that has been made, of the Porosity of Membranes, brings into my mind what I once observed at the Dissection, made by some Phy&rehy;sicians, and Anatomists, of a lusty Souldier, that was hanged for I know not what crime. This man, though otherwise young and sound, was observed to have been long molested with what they call a <IT>short, dry Cough</IT>, which made us expect to find some<PB
N="51">thing much amiss in his Lungs. But meeting with nothing there, we were at a loss for the cause of this Cough, till coming to consider the internal part of the Chest, we perceived some&rehy;thing on one of the sides, by tracing of which we discovered, that between the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Pleura</FOREIGN> and the substance of the intercostal muscles, there was lodged a certain matter, of the breadth of a Silver Crown piece, or thereabouts, of a roundish figure, and of the con&rehy;sistence and almost colour of new, soft Cheese, which odd stuff was concluded to have been the remains of some ill cured Pleurisy, and to have transmitted through the Pores of the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Pleura</FOREIGN></IT>, though that be a very close Membrane, some noxious<IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN></IT>, which ever and anon irrita&rehy;ted the Lungs into an irregular and troublesom motion, and so produced the Cough the Malefactor had been molested with.</P>

<P>&Iic; Am well aware that 'tis far less difficult, to prove the permeable&rehy;ness of single Membranes, than that of such a Part of the Body, as seems to be an aggregate of several parts, which in regard of their close adhesion, are looked upon but as one part, to which, on that account, men common&rehy;ly give a distinct name. But yet there are some <IT>Ph&aelig;nomena</IT> that seem to ar&rehy;gue, that even such compounded or re&rehy;sulting parts, if I may so call them, are not destitute of Pores, which whether they be not some of them the Orifices of exceeding slender and therefore unobserved Capillary Ves&rehy;sels, I must not now stay to enquire.
</P><P>When the cavity of the <IT>Abdomen</IT> in those Hydropical Persons that are troubled with an <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ascites</FOREIGN>, is filled with Water, or rather with a Liquor that I have found to be much more viscous, it justly appears strange, that by an <PB
N="53">Hydragogue, or some appropriated purging medicine, great quantities of this gross Liquor should in a short time be carryed off by Siege, and per&rehy;haps also by Urine, though to get into the cavity of the Guts, or that of either of the Kidneys, it seems neces&rehy;sary that it Permeate the Tunicles, and other component parts, of the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Viscera</FOREIGN></IT> it gets into.</P>
<P>I know not whether I may on this occasion take notice of what Physici&rehy;ans observe to occur now and then in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Empyema's</FOREIGN> that follow ill condition&rehy;ed <IT>Pleurisies</IT>. For it has several times been observed, that upon the bursting of such imposthumes into the cavity of the Chest, the Purulent matter hath been voided by Siege and Urine. I hesi&rehy;tate, as I was saying, whether I should alledge this <IT>Ph&aelig;nomenon</IT>, as a proof of what I now contend for, till it be de&rehy;termined whether this <IT>Metastasis</IT> be made by <IT>transudation</IT> properly so called, or by the ingress of the <IT>Pus</IT> into the imperfectly closed Orifices of the Vessels of the Lungs; <PB
N="54">where being once admitted and min&rehy;gled with the Blood they may with this circulating Liquor arrive at the Kidneys, or any other Parts fitted to make a secretion of this Heterogeneous matter.</P>
<P>But whatever be the Reason or manner of it, we find that the Lungs do sometimes odly convey things to distant parts of the Body. And if I may here mention a thing, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">cui honos pr&aelig;fa&rehy;tionis est</FOREIGN>, I shall add that I have seve&rehy;ral times observ'd in my self, that when I had been an actor or an assistant in the Dissection of a living Dog, es&rehy;pecially if his Blood or Body were rankly Scented, I should divers hours after plainly find that odour in the ex&rehy;crements I voided by Siege.</P>
<P>A famous Chirurgeon and Anato&rehy;mist relates, that one who was very ill of a dropsy, judged to arise from a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Scirrhus</FOREIGN> of the Spleen, coming to ask his counsel and assistance, though he judged the patients case desperate, yet to content him, he ordered him to dip a very large Sponge in good Quick<PB
N="55">lime-Water, and having squeezed out the superfluous Liquor, to bind it upon the region of the Spleen, only shifting it from time to time. He adds, that after some months he was much surprized to receive a visit from this Patient, with solemn thanks for his recovery; the outward Medicine having, it seems, resolved the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Scirrhus</FOREIGN></IT> and concurred with nature to evacuate the hydropical humour. For the re&rehy;solution of which hard tumour it seems necessary, that the sanative Cor&rehy;puscles of the external remedy should at length penetrate, not only the <IT>Epidermis</IT>, and the true <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Cutis</FOREIGN></IT>, but the Muscles themselves of the <IT>Abdo&rehy;men</IT>, and some other interposed parts.</P>
<P>These instances may be strengthen'd by an eminent observation of <IT>Galen</IT>, who takes notice that Bones being sometimes broken, without piercing the Skin that covers the part they be&rehy;long to, when the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Callus</FOREIGN> is making, and the broken parts of the bone begin to be conglutinated together, a Portion <PB
N="56">of that Blood which had flowed to the part affected is carryed to the Skin and permeats that, so as to wet and foul the Dressings or Bandages that are kept upon the limb affected by the Fracture.</P>

<DIV N="VII" TYPE="chapter"><HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>&Bic;<IT>Ones, Horns</IT>, and parts of the like Substance, being those that are granted to be the most solid of the Bodies of Animals, I come in the last place to shew by particular Experi&rehy;ments that these also have their <IT>Pores</IT>. I say, by particular Experiments, because in a general way, their <IT>Porosity</IT> has been already proved, by the same Arguments, from their original Tex&rehy;ture, Nutrition, Augmentation, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> That have been employed to manifest the <IT>Porousness of Animal substances in general</IT>.
</P><P>That the Nails of men, as well as their <IT>Skins</IT>, are Porous, may be gathered from their being easily and <PB
N="57">permanently tinged with divers me&rehy;talline solutions, and particularly those of silver in <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Aquafortis</FOREIGN>, and Gold in <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Aqua Regia</FOREIGN></IT>; the former of which solutions though cold, will but too easily tinge the Skin and Nails it chances to touch, and makes some little stay upon, with a dark and blackish colour; which I found not that I could wash out with water, or, even with a far more penetrating and abstersive liquor. The like durableness I found in the Purple spots, that I sometimes purposely made on my Nails, by letting some little drops of the solution of Gold in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Aqua Regia</FOREIGN></IT> dry upon them, which I now and then did, to observe the way of the Nails growth. For if the stain were made near the root of the nail, it would be still, though very slowly, thrust on by the new matter, till after some weeks it arrived to the further end of the Nail, and was fit to be pared off with it. But this only upon the by. 'Tis more to our pur&rehy;pose to take notice, that, though the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Menstruums</FOREIGN></IT> imployed in the recited <PB N="58">Experiments be of themselves very acid and corrosive, yet they are so changed by the metals they have dis&rehy;solved, that they are Acid no more, the solution of Silver being rather ex&rehy;treamly bitter, and that of Gold of a kind of <IT>Stiptic</IT> tast, almost like that which sloes, growing in the hedges, are wont to be of.</P>
<P>Ivory is a thing too well known to need to be described. And, since 'tis generally lookt upon (for I have had no opportunity to compare it with the Bones) as the solidest part of the vastest of Terestrial Animals, Expe&rehy;riments proving its porosity, will be strong presumptions for that of the hardest parts of other Animals. And the Porousness of Ivory may be argu&rehy;ed from the several ways of dying it with permanent colours. For in these colorations the Tinctures that make them, must penetrate into, and be lodged in the Substance of the Ivory, especially when the Substance remains smooth and glassy, as I have divers times made it do, when I employed <PB
N="59">fit <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Menstruums</FOREIGN> and Metalline Pigments. The solution I formerly mentioned of Silver in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Aqua fortis</FOREIGN></IT>, being laid upon Ivory, will soon give it a dark and blackish stain, which is not, that I have found, to be washed off. I remember also that I many years since taught some ingenious artificers, to adorn Ivory with a fine purple colour, by moistening it with, and suffering lei&rehy;surely to dry on it, a solution of Gold made in <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Aqua Regia</FOREIGN></IT>. And if occasion required, allayed with water, nor needs either of these solutions be applyed hot, any more than the Ivory needs to be heated. Both which cir&rehy;cumstances favour the Porousness of the solid Body.</P>
<P>Copper dissolved in <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Aqua fortis</FOREIGN> stains Ivory with a blewish colour, as I have sometimes seen in the hafts of knifes, about whose coloration never&rehy;theless another way is also employed. But I remember that without making use of any Acid or Corrosive <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Men&rehy;struum</FOREIGN></IT>, I have even in the cold stained Ivory, with a fine and permanent <PB
N="60">blew, like a Turquois, by suffering to dry upon it as deep a solution as I could make of Crude Copper, in an urinous Spirit, as that of <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Sal Ar&rehy;moniack</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>But now to return to Bones, their growth in all their dimensions, does, as I lately noted, argue their Porosity and the marrow that is found in the great hollow Bones, whether it nou&rehy;rish them or no, must it self be supply&rehy;ed by some alimental juice, that soaks or otherways penetrates, into the ca&rehy;vities that contain it.</P>
<P>Nor does it seem at all improbable, that Blood it self may through small Vessels be conveyed into the very sub&rehy;stance of the Bone, so as that the Vessels reach at least a little way in it, though perhaps the Liquor they carry may afterwards by Imbibition be brought to the more internal parts of the Bone. For not to urge that we manifestly see, that on each side of the lower Jaw, Nature has been careful to perforate the Bones and make a Chan&rehy;nel in the substance of it; which Channel <PB
N="61">receives not only a larger Nerve but a Vein, & Artery to bring in & carry back Blood for the nourishment of the Teeth, by distinct Sprigs sent from the great branch to the particular Teeth. Not to urge this, I say, (which I mention but to shew that the opi&rehy;nion lately proposed is agreeable to a known practice of Nature) I have been assured by eminent Anatomists, whom I purposely consulted, that they have observed Blood vessels to enter a great way into the substance of the larger Bones. And one of them affirmed, that he had traced a Vessel even to the great Cavity of the Bone. Which I the less scrupled to admit, because it has been observed, that in younger Animals the Cavity is in great part furnished with Blood, as well as Mar&rehy;row, and in those larger Pores, where&rehy;of many are found in the more Spongy Substance of divers Bones, Blood has been observed to have been lodged, as also in the spongy part of the Skull, that lies between the two Tables, as I have been assured by Skilful Eye&rehy;witnesses.</P>
<PB N="62"><P>The blackness also, that Bones ac&rehy;quire when put into a competent heat, and a peculiar kind of fat&rehy;ness which they may by heat be made to afford, shew that they harbour, even in their internal parts, store of Unctuous Particles, separable from the solid substance, (which still retains its shape and continues solid) in whose Pores they may thereby be argued to have been lodged. The Lightness of Bones, even when their Cavity is accessible to (Air and) Water, is also a great sign of their Porosity. And so is their being cor&rehy;roded by tinging liquors, if they be penetrative and well applyed. I know not whether I should add on this oc&rehy;casion, that having taken calcined and pulverized Bones, such as we use to make our Cupels of, and, after having given them a good heat, kept them for some time in the Air, but in a well covered place; I found the imbibed moisture of the Air to have manifestly increased their weight; and that I also observed in a curious <IT>Skeleton</IT>, <PB
N="63">where the Bones were kept together by wires, instead of other Ligaments, that though I kept it in a well cover&rehy;ed place, not far from a Kitchin Fire, yet in very moist weather the Bones seemed to swell, since those joynts that were easy to be bent, in dry weather, and that after several man&rehy;ners, would grow stiff and refractory, and indisposed to be put into such motions, when the weather was con&rehy;siderably wet. These particulars (as I was saying) I am somewhat doubt&rehy;ful whether I should here insert, be&rehy;cause one may suspect the <IT>Ph&aelig;no&rehy;mena</IT> may proceed rather from some&rehy;what else, than the imbibed moisture of the Air; and yet I would not omitt to mention these observations, because I do not yet see any cause to which they may more probably (or indeed so probably) be assigned.
</P><P>And on this occasion I shall subjoyn some observations made on large and solid Ox Bones, which in one of my Note Books I find thus registred. <IT>Nov.</IT> 15. We weighed two [entire or un<PB
N="64">broken] Marrow Bones, and found the one to weigh &ounce;xxix + &dram;ss;, and the other &ounce;xxiv + &dram;iv + 30 gr. <IT>Nov.</IT> 24. The former weighed &ounce;xxix + &dram;vi, and the latter &ounce;xxv + &dram;i + 30 gr. <IT>Decemb.</IT> 28. the former weigh&rehy;ed &ounce;xxix + &dram;iij. 55 gr. and the latter &ounce;xxiv + &dram;vii. + 39 gr. <IT>June</IT> 7th of the following year, the former weigh'd &ounce;xxix + &dram;ii. And the latter &ounce;xxiv + &dram;vii. By which observations purposely made at differing times of the year, and in very good scales, it seems that Bones do plentifully enough imbibe the Exhalations of the Air, and emit them again, together with some of their own, according as the ambi&rehy;ent happens to be disposed. And these alterations argue the Bones to abound with Pores, since the external steams must have Pores to receive them, and the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Effluvia</FOREIGN> must upon their recess leave Pores behind them.</P>
<P>I confess that to think (as with some Anatomists I lately seemed to do) that Bones themselves admit in&rehy;to their substance, Vessels capable of <PB
N="65">conveying a nutritive Liquor, we must suppose those Vessels extreamly slender. But that 'tis not only possible but somewhat credible, there may be such, I am induced to think, by what is known to happen in that disease, which from the Country it most infests is called the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Plica Polonica</FOREIGN>. For, tho one would think that the hairs of men are much too slender, to have cavities in them capable of visible Li&rehy;quors; and though I have found it very difficult, even with a good Microscope, to perceive any cavities in the hair of a man transversly cut; yet not only some other writers of good note, but the Judicious <IT>Sennertus</IT> himself deliver, that in this disease (of which he par&rehy;ticularly treats) it has been observed, that if the Patients cause their intan&rehy;&rehy;gled hair to be cut, as they sometimes do, by reason of its nastiness or un&rehy;sightliness, they are not only thereby endangered, but sometimes the single hairs will actually bleed, where the ends have been cut off; so that so thick a Liquor as Blood may be conveyed <PB
N="66">through Vessels, that can at most be but in a proper sense <IT>Capillary</IT> and must be far less than hairs, if their Perfora&rehy;tions be like those by which many Plants have their nourishment con&rehy;veyed to them, or such as are obvious in divers Canes, which being cut quite through transversly, discover a mul&rehy;titude of distinct Pores, that by some Experiments one may be induced to guess, reach all along, and make the Cane like a Cylindrical Bundle of Minute Pipes; or rather a multitude of small cavities, that perforate from end to end the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Parenchyma</FOREIGN></IT>, or Substance analogous to it, that gives them stabi&rehy;lity. And for the present this sort of Vessels seem to me, the more likely to be those that convey the Blood to the extream Parts of the Hair, be&rehy;cause even in Horse hairs, which yet are nourished and grow, I am not yet sure, that I have discovered with my Microscopes any cavity, and there&rehy;fore suspect there may be divers im&rehy;perceptible ones, for the Hair is nou&rehy;rished and grows, which it is not like <PB
N="67">it should do if the Body were solid; and if there were but a single cavity in it, as in the lower part of a Quill, 'tis like the Microscope I used would have dis&rehy;covered it, since with one much infe&rehy;riour I could easily see, that several little short Hairs, that grow upon the Animal that yields Musk, had each of them a cavity in it like that of the lower part of a Quill.</P>
<P>To the things that have already been said about the Porosity of Bones, I shall now add an observation of a very learned Physician, that is very remarkable to our present purpose, because it argues, that even Bodies not saline, nor actually moist, may from without get into the Pores and Cavities of Humane Bones. Divers Physicians have complain'd of the mis&rehy;chiefs done to the Bones by Mercu&rehy;ry, employ'd to salivate in Venereal Diseases. Whereof I remember I have read a very notable Instance, in a learned Book (which I have not now by me) of an eminent Roman Pro&rehy;fessor of Physick, who had the oppor<PB
N="68">tunity of making several curious ob&rehy;servations in the famous Hospital of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Incurabili</FOREIGN> at <IT>Rome</IT>; and is there&rehy;fore the more to be credited; where he relates, that in the Cavity of at least one Pocky-mans Bones, there was found real Quick Silver that had pe&rehy;netrated thither. And this brings into my mind a memorable observation of an ancient and experienced Physi&rehy;cian, who being famous for the cure of Venereal Diseases, was asked by me, what Instances he had found of the Penetration of Quick-Silver, either outwardly or inwardly administred, into the Bones of men? To this he answered, that he could not say he had himself taken notice of any Quick&rehy;Silver, in the Cavities of greater Bones, but that some other Practition&rehy;ers had told him, that they had met with such Instances, as I enquired after. But for himself, he only remem&rehy;bred that a Patient, who had been ter&rehy;ribly fluxed with mercurial Inunctions, coming afterwards to have one of the Grinders of his lower Jaw pulled out, <PB
N="69">because of the raging pain it had long put him to; my Relater had the cu&rehy;riosity to view narrowly this great Tooth, and found, to his wonder, a little drop of true Mercury in that slender Cavity of the Root, that ad&rehy;mits the small Vessels which convey nourishment and sense to the Tooth, in more than one of whose three Roots he affirmed to me that he found true, though but exceeding little, Quick-Silver. <NOTE

<P>&Iic; Am not ignorant that, among the Particulars laid together in the foregoing Essay, there are some that are not absolutely necessary, to prove the Porousness of the Bodies of Animals. But I thought it not impertinent to mention them, because I hoped that they, in conjunction with the rest, may be of some use to Naturalists, in giving an account of several things that pass in a Humane Body, whether sound or sick, especially if it be of a Topical dis&rehy;ease, and may remove, or much lessen that great Prejudice, that makes ma&rehy;ny (and some of them otherwise learned) Physicians despise the use of all <IT>Amulets, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Pericarpia</FOREIGN></IT>, and other ex&rehy;ternal Medicines in Distempers of the Inward parts, upon a confident, but not well grounded supposition, that these Remedies immediately touching but the outside of the Skin, can&rehy;not exercise any considerable opera<PB

</P><P>But though I have thus acknow&rehy;ledged some Passages of the foregoing Essay to be supernumerary, yet I must not dismiss it without intimating that I might from one Topick more have fetched a probable, though not a de&rehy;monstrative argument, in favour of the Porousness of Animals. For this may be very probably argued from hence, that even Inanimate, Solid and Pon&rehy;derous Bodies, that in all likelyhood must be of a far closer Texture than the living Bodies of Animals (whose various Functions require a greater number and diversity of Pores in their differing Organs) are not devoid of Pores, and have some of them very numerous ones, as will be sufficiently made out in the following Essay, to which I shall therefore hasten.</P></DIV></BODY>
