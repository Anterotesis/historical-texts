<HEAD>A <BO>LETTER</BO> FROM <IT>Mr. HUMPHRY HODY</IT>, TO A FRIEND.
Concerning a Collection of Canons, said to be <IT>deceitfully</IT> Omitted by him, in his Edition of the <IT>Oxford</IT> Treatise against <IT>SCHISM</IT>.</HEAD>
<SALUTE><SC>Sir</SC>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Aic; Day or Two ago, upon my Return out of the Country, I receiv'd your <IT>Letter</IT>, which had lain some time expecting me. In which you are pleas'd to advise me, concerning a <IT>Report</IT> industriously spread abroad, by the Abettors of our present <IT>Schism</IT>, That the <IT>Treatise</IT> against it, which I lately Translated out of the <IT>Barrocian</IT> MS. is <IT>Par&rehy;tially</IT>, and <IT>Deceitfully</IT> publish't; That there are some <IT>Canons</IT> belonging to it omitted, which would, if publisht, have <IT>unravel'd</IT> the Whole. I had heard of such a Report before I receiv'd your <IT>Letter</IT>, but I rather admir'd at the <IT>Heat</IT> and <IT>Judgment</IT> of those <PB
N="2">that first <UNCLEAR>perus'd</UNCLEAR> it, then thought it worthy to be taken notice off by me, and refuted. I could hardly believe, that they, that were the Authors of it, were really in <IT>earnest</IT>, when first the <IT>Noise</IT> was made; and, if they were in earnest, I knew that their Judg&rehy;ments were <IT>determin'd</IT> by so strong a <IT>Biass</IT> of <IT>Resent&rehy;ment</IT> and <IT>Zeal</IT> for a <IT>Cause</IT>, that all men must easily perceive it. I could not perswade my self, that any Person of common <IT>Ingenuity</IT> and <IT>Candour</IT>, could be&rehy;lieve me guilty of so <IT>dull</IT> a Piece of <IT>Knavery</IT>, a <IT>Kna&rehy;very</IT> so easily <IT>discoverable</IT>, and that by my own <IT>Di&rehy;rection</IT>. It was really very <IT>entertaining</IT> to observe, to what little <IT>Arts</IT> and <IT>Shiftings</IT> our Adversaries were reduc'd. I plainly saw by their <IT>Passion</IT>, and their holding up <IT>dirty Hands</IT>, that I had given 'em a <IT>Fall</IT>. And I could not wonder, that so <IT>small</IT> a Person as your Friend should be so <IT>stigmatiz'd</IT>, when even <IT>Cecilianus</IT>, the great Arch-Bishop of <IT>Carthage</IT>, was, by the Schismatical <IT>Donatists</IT>, call'd downright <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="inline"><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Nebulo</FOREIGN>.</NOTE> <IT>Knave</IT>, in a Letter to the Emperour <IT>Constantine</IT>; and that too, tho He himself had <IT>Judicially</IT> acquitted him, and declar'd him a worthy Arch-Bishop. 'Tis this is the <IT>Humour</IT>, and indeed the <IT>Unhappiness</IT>, of Mankind: If in your <IT>Opinions</IT>, or <IT>Actions</IT>, you chance to run counter to a <IT>Party</IT>, there is no expecting of <IT>Quarter</IT>: you are fallen in among <IT>Rapparees</IT>, and, if it lies in their power, <IT>God have mercy upon you</IT>, you will certainly <IT>fall</IT> by one <IT>Weapon</IT> or other; you must either be a <IT>Fool</IT> or a <IT>Knave</IT>. Where the <IT>Bluntness</IT> of the for&rehy;mer will not <IT>pierce</IT>, there the <IT>Sharpness</IT> of the latter must be try'd. They will <IT>stab</IT> one at the <IT>Heart</IT>, if they cannot <IT>knock</IT> one on the <IT>Head</IT>. This they will be sure to endeavour to do: but the best of it is, it <PB
N="3">does often happen, that there's no one <IT>hurt</IT> but Them&rehy;selves. I was confident it would prove so with me: I knew it was impossible, that the <IT>Dirt</IT>, wherewith I was so freely and bountifully <IT>bespatter'd</IT>, should <IT>stick</IT> long upon me, that a little <IT>Time</IT> would of course <IT>dry</IT> it off; and if not so, 'twould however come out by the least <IT>Rubbing</IT>. The Design of those, that first blew abroad that strange and <IT>improbable</IT> Rumour, was so obvious to all, that would give themselves leave to <IT>Think</IT>, that I could not imagine, any Per&rehy;sons of sound Understanding could possibly give Ear to it: The <IT>Fort</IT> I had <IT>happily</IT> rais'd was very <IT>strong</IT> and <IT>impregnable, well-mann'd</IT> with stout and uncon&rehy;querable <IT>Veterans</IT>; and who could not see through so common and usual a <IT>Stratagem</IT>, as that of a <IT>False Report</IT>? What else could be done to keep up the <IT>sink&rehy;ing</IT> Spirits of the Adverse Party? It was necessary they should be <IT>perswaded</IT>, that tho there was an Ap&rehy;pearance of many <IT>Brave</IT> Men upon the <IT>Walls</IT>, yet there lay in the <IT>Town</IT> conceal'd, a much stronger Party, <IT>Well-wishers</IT> to Them, that would shew Them&rehy;selves shortly, discover the <IT>Weakness</IT> of the rest, and deliver up the <IT>Place</IT>.
</P><P>These Considerations, <IT>Sir</IT>, made me altogether <IT>secure</IT>, and <IT>regardless</IT> of that <IT>idle</IT> and <IT>unlikely Tale</IT>: But you blame me, you say; I must not any longer despise it; It is still, as you tell me, con&rehy;tinu'd, and by many believ'd. And the Author of a <IT>Pamphlet</IT> entitl'd, <IT>An Apology for the New Separation, &amp;c.</IT> has made a publick Complaint of my <IT>Disin&rehy;genuity</IT> in this matter? He says, he is <IT>assur'd by his Friends in Oxford</IT>, that that <IT>Collection of Canons</IT>, which follows our <IT>Tract</IT> in the MS. is a part of the <IT>Tract</IT>, and that it shews plainly, that the Author <PB
N="4">of the <IT>Tract</IT>, when he contends, That <q rend=it>A Bishop unjustly depos'd ought not to make a Division in the Church provided his Successor be Orthodox</q>, is to be understood of onely a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>; By which he means, that the Author of the Treatise supposes, that, if a Bishop unjustly depriv'd, be depriv'd by a <IT>Secular Power</IT>, and not by a <IT>Synod of Bishops</IT>, then he is not oblig'd not to make a Separation. Upon this ac&rehy;count, I see 'tis high time to <IT>rowse</IT> up my self a little, since <IT>the Philistins are</IT> so much <IT>upon me</IT>. I shall now, <IT>Sir</IT>, obey your Commands, in laying before you those <IT>Canons</IT> which our Adversaries so much boast off, and the <IT>Reasons</IT> why I did not publish 'em to&rehy;gether with the Treatise; That you your self may judge what a <IT>Nothing</IT> that is, that has made such a <IT>Bounce</IT>; that 'tis onely <IT>meer Powder</IT>, that can hurt no one else but the Person that <IT>Fires</IT>.</P>
<P>In the first place, <IT>Sir</IT>, I must assure you, That when I transcrib'd our <IT>Treatise</IT> out of the <IT>Baroccian</IT> MS. I did it as an <IT>Historian</IT>, or a <IT>Philologer</IT>, or what&rehy;soever else you will call it, not imagining then, I should ever send it abroad upon such an Occasion: If therefore the aforesaid <IT>Canons</IT> do truly belong to the <IT>Treatise</IT>, it is to be imputed to the <IT>error</IT> and <IT>mistake</IT> of my <IT>Judgment</IT>, and not to an <IT>ill Design</IT>, that they are omitted. I perus'd 'em, I remember, at that time, and they seem'd to me (as they still do) not at all to belong to the <IT>Treatise</IT>. They are written, I grant, in the same hand, and immediatly follow the <IT>Treatise</IT>, but (for God-sake!) what then? Are they therefore a part of the foregoing Treatise? What a wretched Judgment must that needs be, that can draw so strange a Conclusion? Here I cannot but re&rehy;turn you that <IT>Story</IT>, which once, I remember, you told <PB
N="5">me, of that poor Country Person who would needs have the <IT>Book-binder's Leaf</IT> to be a part of his <IT>Bible</IT>: He was told, it came after the <IT>Index</IT> that was in that Bible, and was not at all to the Purpose; no matter for that, it was Printed, he said, in the very same Letter, and must therefore needs be a Part. If you pittied the <IT>Simpleness</IT> of that poor Man, what, <IT>Sir</IT>, will you say, when you see even <IT>Learned</IT> and otherwise <IT>Worthy</IT> Men so much prostitute their Judg&rehy;ments to <IT>Resentment</IT> and the <IT>serving of a Cause</IT>, that rather then not be <IT>Reveng'd</IT> on the <IT>saucy</IT> Publisher of so <IT>pestilent</IT> a Treatise, and supply their Adherents with an <IT>Antidote</IT> against it, they will let themselves down to the lowest degree of <IT>Absurdness</IT>? We grant that our <IT>Treatise</IT> and the <IT>Canons</IT>, that follow it, are written in a <IT>Hand</IT> somewhat different from the rest of the <IT>Volume</IT>: But what can be thence concluded? Are our Adversaries so extreamly Strangers to MS. Volumes, as not to know, that, as they consist very often of several Treatises, and of several Hands, so many times they have <IT>two</IT> Tracts together, or more, of one Hand? This is true in particular of that very Volume, out of which our <IT>Treatise</IT> was publisht. The other Parts of the Volume, besides our <IT>Treatise</IT> and the <IT>Canons</IT>, are not all written in the same Hand, but in several: In one Hand two or three Treatises, in another two or three Others; it being made up of the Pieces of several Volumes bound together.</P>
<P>First, <IT>Sir</IT>, it is to be observ'd, That he that Tran&rehy;scrib'd that Volume, out of which the Leaves of our <IT>Treatise</IT> and the <IT>Canons</IT> were taken, and put into that in which they now ly; He, I say, that Tran&rehy;scrib'd our <IT>Treatise</IT> and the <IT>Canons</IT>, seems himself to <PB
N="6">have took 'em for two distinct Pieces: For between the <IT>Abstract</IT>, or <IT>Summary</IT>, of the <IT>Treatise</IT> and the Be&rehy;ginning of the <IT>Canons</IT>, there is somewhat a <IT>wider</IT> Space, than between the Lines of the <IT>Treatise</IT>, or be&rehy;tween the <IT>Treatise</IT> and the <IT>Abstract</IT> of it. And what (I pray) if the <IT>Canons</IT> had been written just close upon the Treatise? I can shew you some <IT>Scores</IT> of Examples of <IT>Collections</IT> or <IT>Treatises</IT> wholy distinct, so closely connected in the Writing, without any Note of Distinction, that no one, but he that reads 'em, can possibly take 'em to be distinct. Who so little ac&rehy;quainted with this sort of Learning, as not to know, that <IT>Librarians</IT>, or Transcribers of Books, were oftentimes ignorant Persons, that did not at all under&rehy;stand what they wrote, but, like <IT>Horace's</IT> Painter, <IT>join'd</IT> oftentimes <IT>the Head of a Man to the Neck of a Horse</IT>?</P>
<P>In the Second place it is to be observ'd, That the <IT>Treatise</IT> as it is in the MS. and as it is publisht, is thus concluded: <Q>TO CONCLUDE ALL IN A WORD; ONE THING ONELY <IT>was requir'd by the Church (<FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK"><CORR>katholou gar eipein hen monon ex&emacr;iteito h&emacr; ekkl&emacr;sia	</CORR></FOREIGN> &amp;c.) that the new Bishop should profess the same (Orthodox) Faith with the other that was depos'd, but as for other Complaints and Accusations, except it were Heresy, she never made any Examination into them</it></q>. What Person of so little Sagacity and Judgment, as not to see, that here the <IT>whole</IT> Treatise is ended?</P>
<P>In the Third place, I shall give you as clear and plain a Demonstration, as can possibly be brought for the Confirmation of any thing of this Nature. It is this: Between the <IT>Conclusion</IT> of the <IT>Treatise</IT>, and the foresaid <IT>Collection of Canons</IT>, there comes in, in the MS. the <IT>Abstract</IT> or <IT>Summary</IT> of the Treatise, <PB
N="7">which stands, as it were, for an <IT>Index</IT>, as 'tis pub&rehy;lisht in <CORR
SIC="borh">both</CORR> the Editions. I cannot but admire, how it possibly could enter into any Man's Head, that that is a part of the <IT>Treatise</IT>, which follows the <IT>Abstract</IT> or <IT>Epitome</IT> of the Treatise.</P>
<P>In the Fourth place, it is to be <CORR SIC="obsetv'd">observ'd</CORR>, and this is likewise as clear a Demonstration as any one can possibly desire, That the Canons which follow our Treatise are barely transcrib'd, not at all connected by any words of the Transcriber; Not a word of his in either the beginning, or the end, or mixt with 'em, as I know by comparing them with those that are Printed; When yet it is certain, that the Author of our Treatise does every where use his <IT>own</IT> Style. Neither does he make any mention, in any part of his Treatise, that he would subjoin any <IT>Canons</IT>. If the <IT>Canons</IT> had belong'd to the <IT>Treatise</IT>, 'tis ab&rehy;surd to imagine that the Author would have said no&rehy;thing of 'em, not exprest his Design in transcribing 'em. And if he had produc'd 'em, as our Adversa&rehy;ries would have it believ'd, to shew that in the fore&rehy;going <IT>Treatise</IT>, he understood onely a <IT>Synodical De&rehy;privation</IT>, why does he not somewhere say so? Why make no mention of a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>? Why leave us to judge of his <IT>meaning</IT> by his <IT>gaping</IT>?</P>
<P>This News, <IT>Sir</IT>, I know, will surprize you, which I tell you concerning the <IT>bareness</IT> of the Canons, that they are <IT>nakedly</IT> transcrib'd, without any one Word added by the Transcriber; For you tell me, I remember, in your Letter, that they that talk of this Matter, are wont to bring this for an Argument that the <IT>Canons</IT> belong to the <IT>Treastise</IT>, That there are added some Words at the end of the <IT>Canons</IT>, which plainly refer to the <IT>Treatise</IT>. And for this, <PB
N="8">as you say, the Authority of a very great Man is wont to be quoted. Let me tell you, <IT>Sir</IT>, I can now <IT>leap about</IT> with a <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">heur&emacr;ka</FOREIGN>. It is true, The thing has been all along confidently affirm'd by a very great Man, as you very deservedly call him: But take my Word for't, You will hear no more of that Matter. I enquir'd, <IT>Sir</IT>, lately of that Learned and otherwise very Accurate Person, What Words those were which he meant; and I found he had mistaken a Part of the last of the Canons for the Words of the Transcriber. This is strange, <IT>you</IT> will say: I, for my part, shall say nothing of it; but leave it for others to judge. But this I must add, that the Words which were alleg'd by that Gentleman to be the Transcriber's own, supposing they were the <IT>Transcriber's</IT>, (as we know very well they are not) do contain nothing in 'em, that could prove the Transcriber to have been the same Man with our Author. There is nothing from whence it might be gather'd that the <IT>Canons</IT> did be&rehy;long to our <IT>Treatise</IT>; not a <IT>Tittle</IT> from whence it might be prov'd that our Author therefore transcrib'd 'em, to shew that he meant a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>. You will judge of this by and by, by reading the Words your self. You will easily see, that Men, whose <IT>Eyes</IT> have contracted a <IT>Yellowness</IT> (whatsoever otherwise their <IT>Temper</IT> or <IT>Constitution</IT> may be,) read every thing agreeably to the <IT>Colour</IT> in their <IT>Heads</IT>.</P>
<P>I come now lastly to the <IT>Canons</IT> themselves; Let them speak for themselves: We need nothing else to refute the strange <IT>Fancy</IT> and <IT>Dream</IT> of our Adver&rehy;saries. The Argument, you know, of the <IT>Treatise</IT>, is to shew by many Examples, That it's <IT>contrary</IT> to the <IT>Practice</IT> of the <IT>Antients</IT>, for a Bishop unjustly de&rehy;pos'd to recede from the <IT>Communion</IT> of an <IT>Ortho<PB
N="9">dox</IT> Successor. Pray look with both Eyes, and see if you can possibly find in the <IT>Canons</IT> any thing truly pertinent to that particular Subject. The Ar&rehy;gument and Design of them, is against private Con&rehy;venticles without a lawful Presbyter: against a Pres&rehy;byter or a Deacon's withdrawing from the Com&rehy;munion of his Bishop without a just Cause: that a Bishop being condemn'd by the Bishops of the same Province, it shall not be in the power of the Bishops of another Province to take the matter into their Cognisance: against such Presbyters as shall sepa&rehy;rate from their Bishops on pretence of some Crimes they can charge 'em with, before they be legally convicted: against such Bishops as shall pretend to condemn their <IT>Metropolitan</IT>, and to leave his Com&rehy;munion on pretence of his Vices, before he is legally condemn'd: and lastly, against such Metropolitans as shall act in like manner with relation to their <IT>Patriarch</IT>. I shall here translate you these Canons in the same order as they ly in the MS. In Doctor <IT>Beveridge's</IT> <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="ROGK">Synodicon</FOREIGN> you may read 'em all in the Original.</P>
<P><IT>Can. Apost. XXXI. If a Presbyter shall in con&rehy;tempt of his Bishop, gather a separate Congregation, and erect another Altar, his Bishop being not condemn'd</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="inline"><IT>Not.</IT> That the seeming supposition of this Canon, that its lawful for a Pres&rehy;byter to recede from the Communion of his Bishop, and to set up an Altar against him, if he be a Vicious Person, is <IT>unjust</IT>, as <IT>Balsamon</IT> affirms, and contrary to the express declaration of other Canons of the Greek Church, and particularly one of those that follow. But I scarce doubt, but that they that compos'd the Canons, in&rehy;tended that the Bishop should be judici&rehy;ally and Canonically condemn'd for the Crime alleg'd against him by the Presby&rehy;ter, tho the words, <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">m&emacr;den kategn&omacr;k&omacr;s en eusebeiai kai dikaiosyn&emacr;i</FOREIGN>, do not plainly express it.</NOTE> <IT>by him for any Impiety or Injustice, let him be depriv'd as Ambitious. For he is a Tyrant. In like manner others of the Clergy that shall ad&rehy;here to him. But let the <PB
N="10">Laity (that shall make themselves of his Party) be ex&rehy;communicated. And let these things be done after three Admonitions given by the Bishop</IT>. What is this (in God's Name!) to our Treatise? How does this prove our Author's Meaning to be of a <IT>Synodical</IT> Depriva&rehy;tion? What is this to the adhering to a Bishop not <IT>Synodically Depriv'd</IT>, in opposition to another put into his Place?</P>
<P><IT>Can. Concil. Gang. VI. If any one in contempt of the Church shall gather a private Congregation, and do those things which belong to the Church, without a Pres&rehy;byter appointed by the Bishop, let him be Anathema</IT>. What relation could this Canon have to the design of our Author? It was made, as <IT>Zonaras</IT> tell us, a&rehy;gainst the <IT>Eustathians</IT>, who despis'd the Congrega&rehy;tions of the Church, and set up Conventicles in their private Oratories; and here they are forbid to celebrate the Service of the Church, even in the pri&rehy;vate Chappels of their Houses, without a Presbyter appointed 'em by the Bishop. This our new <IT>Recu&rehy;sants</IT> would do well to observe.</P>
<P><IT>Can. Concil. Antioch. V. If a Presbyter, or Deacon, shall in contempt of his Bishop separate himself from the Church, and set up a Conventicle, and erect an Altar, and not submit to his Bishop after a second Admonition, let him be depos'd, and let him be uncapable for ever of being restor'd to his Honour, and the Cure of Souls. And if he goes on to raise Troubles and Seditions in the Church, let him be punisht by the Civil Power as a Rioter</IT>. How could this Canon be produc'd by the Author of our Treatise as pertinent to the Subject of it? What's this to a Bishop depriv'd by a <IT>Lay Power</IT>, and the leaving his Communion who is put in his place, which our Adversaries tell us is warranted by the Author of our Treatise?</P>
<PB N="11"><P><IT>The XVth Canon of the same Council. If a Bishop being accus'd of any Crimes, shall be condemn'd by all the Bishops of the Province, and all shall unanimously agree in the Sentence against him, he may not be judg'd again by others, but the Sentence past unanimously by the Bishops of the Province, shall be valid</IT>. This Canon was made to prevent Appeals, which a Bishop depriv'd by the Bishops of the same Province of which he was, might make to some other Bishop, or Bishops, of another Province. Pray, tell me, how it makes to the Busi&rehy;ness and Subject of our Treatise. What <IT>Lynceus</IT> so very strong sighted as to see a Thing at that <IT>Distance</IT>?
</P><P><IT>Can. Concil. Carthag. XI. If a Presbyter through Pride shall make a Schism against his Bishop, let him be Anathema</IT>. This is onely an Epitome of the XI. Canon of the Council of <IT>Carthage</IT>. What a rare relation it has to the particular Subject of our Trea&rehy;tise! What a plain Demonstration it affords, that the Author understands a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>!</P>
<P><IT>The XIII. Canon of the Council call'd the First and Second. The Devil scattering Heretical Seeds in the Church of Christ, and seeing them cut off at the Root by the Sword of the Spirit, has pitcht on another Me&rehy;thod, and endeavours to divide the Body of Christ, by the Madness of Schismaticks: The holy Council, in order to prevent this Snare as well as the other, has decreed, That if any Presbyter or Deacon having condemn'd his Bishop for any Crimes, shall dare to depart from his Com&rehy;munion, and refuse to recite his Name in the Publick Prayers of the Church, according to the usual Custom, before he be Synodically tryed and perfectly condemn'd, that Person shall be depos'd and depriv'd of all his Ho&rehy;nour in the Priesthood. For any one plac't in the order of a Presbyter, if he takes upon him to prevent the Judg<PB
N="12">ment of the Metropolitan, and to condemn and pass Sen&rehy;tence on his Father and Bishop, he is not worthy of the Honour or Name of a Presbyter. And they that adhere to such as have done so, if they are of the Priesthood, let them likewise be depriv'd of their Honour; if Monks, or of the Laity, let 'em be Excommunicated, till they leave the Schismatical Party, and return to their re&rehy;spective Bishop</IT>. I shall pass a Remark on this, and the other two which follow, together.</P>
<P><IT>The XIV. Canon of the same Council. If a Bishop upon charging his Metropolitan with a Crime, shall with&rehy;draw from his Communion, and refuse to recite his Name in the publick Service of the Church according to Custom, before he is Synodically tryed, the holy Council decrees he be depos'd, upon Proof that he made such a Schism. For all Men ought to observe their proper Duties, and the Presbyter must not despise his Bishop, nor the Bishop his Metropolitan</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>The XV. Canon of the same. What has been de&rehy;creed concerning Presbyters, Bishops, and Metropolitans, the same is yet more reasonable with relation to Patri&rehy;archs. If therefore any Presbyter, or Bishop, or Metro&rehy;politan, shall dare to recede from the Communion of his Patriarch, and does not, according to Custom, recite his Name in the Publick Service of the Church, but makes a Schism before his Patriarch has been Synodically try'd, and perfectly condemn'd, the holy Synod ordains, That, upon Proof made of such a Schism, he be depos'd</IT>. <NOTE

For in such a case they do not condemn true Bishops, but false Ones and they do not break the Unity of the Church by a Schism, but endeavour to deliver the Church from Schisms and Divisions</IT>. Here ends the <IT>Collection of Canons</IT>. That which follows immediately in the MS. is altogether forreign both to them and the Treatise, a Fragment of a Story concerning <IT>Artaxares</IT> and <IT>Chosroes</IT> of <IT>Persia</IT>.</P>
<P>And now, <IT>Sir</IT>, you have read all the so much cele&rehy;brated Canons, which have rais'd so great Expecta&rehy;tion, and been made the common <IT>Defence</IT> of those that have been prest with the Authority of the <IT>Ox&rehy;ford Antiquity</IT>. When you light on any of the Ad&rehy;versaries of the <IT>Oxford Antiquity</IT>, pray shew 'em free&rehy;ly to them, and desire them to make their best of 'em: Much good may they do 'em. If you meet with any of 'em so very <IT>Judicious</IT>, as to lay any Stress on the Mention that is made, in these Three last Canons, of a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>; pray desire them to be so just to you, as to give you a Reason. Let 'em give you a Proof that those <IT>Canons</IT> are a Part of the <IT>Treatise</IT>. Let 'em shew how it makes for their Cause, that in them there is mention made of a <IT>Synodical Deprivation</IT>; how it proves that the Author of our Treatise is onely to be understood of a <IT>Synodical</IT> Deprivation. Desire 'em but to open their Eyes, and then they will plainly see, that the whole Design of those <IT>Canons</IT>, is onely against a Se&rehy;paration from our Bishops, and the throwing off <PB
N="14">Canonical Obedience upon our own private Judg&rehy;ments and Pretences; that the Vices or Crimes of a Bishop ought not to be made an Occasion of a <IT>Sepa&rehy;ration</IT>, unless he be <IT>legally</IT> and fully condemn'd and depriv'd. This is still the Doctrine of our Church; and what we in <IT>England</IT> call <IT>Legal</IT>, the <IT>Greeks</IT>, when they spoke with relation to Bishops, call'd a <IT>Synodical</IT> Deprivation, 'cause the ordinary way of Depriving Bishops amongst them, was by the <IT>Metropolitan</IT>, and the rest of the Bishops of the Province; who, <IT>by the Consent of the Emperour</IT>, were constituted the <IT>ordi&rehy;nary</IT> Judges of the Causes of Bishops.</P>
<P>I shall here add, that it is easy for any Man of Judgment to observe, That therefore the <IT>Canons</IT>, which we have above produc'd, were by some Body tackt to our <IT>Treatise</IT> in the MS. because of some kind of Relation which they seem to have to the <IT>General</IT> or <IT>Material</IT> Subject of the Treatise, <IT>viz. Schism</IT> and <IT>Bishops</IT>, tho they have not any Pertinency or Rela&rehy;tion to the <IT>Formal</IT> or <IT>Particular</IT> Subject of it, <IT>The adhering to an Orthodox Bishop in possession, tho the for&rehy;mer Bishop was unjustly turn'd out</IT>. We know, that most of those MS. Volumes, which now our Libra&rehy;ries afford us, were nothing else but so many Vo&rehy;lumes as it were of <IT>Common Places</IT>, in which Men of Learning and Study heapt together such Things as seem'd to them something akin. And hence it is, that in most Theological MSS. or at least in very many, you meet with <IT>Canons</IT> of Councils disperst up and down according to the Subject of the Treatise foregoing. Hence likewise many Fragments of the Fathers subjoin'd to Discourses of Divinity, and o&rehy;thers out of the Historians subjoin'd to Historical Treatises, and the like. A Thousand Instances of <PB
N="15">this may be easily produc'd, if need were; but I shall not spend Pains and Paper in what will easily be granted by all that are acquainted with MSS.</P>
<P>I must not here omit, that besides the Copy of our Treatise which we ow to the <IT>Baroccian</IT> Volume, there is at this time extant another in <IT>France</IT>. It is men&rehy;tion'd by the famous <IT>Cotelerius</IT> in his Notes upon the Third Volume of his <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Monumenta Ecclesi&aelig; Gr&aelig;c&aelig;</FOREIGN>. He quotes it under the Title of a Treatise <NOTE

That that which he mentions is the same with our Treatise, appears by a certain Quotation of <IT>one of the Epistles of Methodius out of the Second Book of Nico</IT>, which is produc'd by <IT>Cotelerius</IT> out of it, and is in the very same words in our Treatise. Since I publisht the Treatise, I receiv'd this Observation from the Famous and Learned Mr. <IT>Dodwel</IT>. Now if any one is so very unwilling to be convinc'd, as not to be satisfied with what we have hitherto said, and he thinks it worth his Curiosity, he would do very well to desire an account of this <IT>Copy</IT> from some Body at <IT>Paris</IT>. It is, I suppose, to be found in the King's Library there, tho <IT>Cotelerius</IT> makes no men&rehy;tion where he had it. Five Hundred to One, but a Month or Six Weeks hence we may have a Report spread abroad, that Advice has been sent from <IT>Paris</IT>, that the aforesaid <IT>Canons</IT> are found in the MS. there in the self same manner as at <IT>Oxford</IT>. A spurious Letter, as from some considerable Man, the <IT>Libra<PB
N="16">rian</IT> himself, or some other, will do very well for that purpose. This would be but a very dull <IT>Im&rehy;posture</IT>, since the Canons make nothing to the Pur&rehy;pose of the <IT>Treatise</IT>: However, I shall here let you know, that it often happens, that Two distinct MS. Copies of a Treatise have the same things subjoin'd at the end of their Treatise. And the Reason is plain, <IT>viz.</IT> Because they were either transcrib'd from one another, or are both <IT>descended</IT> from the same. I know, This is very Dry <IT>Food</IT> for a Person of so deli&rehy;cate and nice a <IT>Digestion</IT> as you are; But however I shall give you one Instance. We have here in <IT>Ox&rehy;ford</IT> amongst the <IT>Barocian</IT> MSS. a Copy of <IT>Anastasius Sinaita (Nicenus</IT> some men miscall him) his <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Qu&aelig;&rehy;stiones Theologic&aelig;</FOREIGN></IT>; at the End of which there are added many Fragments of several Authors, which by the manner of Writing you would take to be part of the <IT>Work</IT>: Another ancient Copy of the same <IT>Work</IT> is extant in the aforesaid Library at <IT>Paris</IT>, in which the same Fragments are exactly found, as I know by a particular account of that Volume which I have met with; And yet it is certain that the Frag&rehy;ments, we speak off, are not part of the Work of <IT>Anastasius</IT>, but annex'd to it by some ancient Libra&rehy;rian. Concerning the Schism which was rais'd upon the account of <IT>Josephus the Presbyter</IT>, of which there is mention in the <IT>Paris</IT> Copy, as the occasion of our Treatises being written, I shall tell you something by and by.</P>
<P>Before I utterly dismiss this Cause, I shall begg your leave to observe, that the <IT>Council</IT> call'd <IT>First and Second</IT>, to which the Three last of the Canons above translated, do belong, was a Council call'd under <IT>Photius</IT> the Patriarch of <IT>Constantinople</IT>; in <PB
N="17">which the said <IT>Photius</IT>, tho made a Patriarch by the Emperour, when <IT>Ignatius</IT> the Patriarch was <IT>unjustly</IT> depos'd by the Emperour's bare Authority, was re&rehy;ceiv'd and own'd as rightful Patriarch, and that whilst <IT>Ignatius</IT> was living. And 'tis further observa&rehy;ble, That that same Council consisted of so many Bishops as to be call'd by <IT>Balsamon</IT>, the learned Pa&rehy;triarch of <IT>Antioch</IT>, <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">oikoumenik&emacr; synodos</FOREIGN> <IT>a General Council</IT>.</P>
<P>And thus much, <IT>Sir</IT>, for our <IT>Canons</IT>. The next thing I observe in your Letter, is what you tell me concerning a very learned and elaborate <IT>Answer</IT>, which you say is ready to be publisht, and very much talkt on, against the <IT>Oxford Antiquity</IT>. As for that, <IT>Sir</IT>, It is no News to Me, and no more than I ever expected. You know, there must somewhat be said. That's a Business of course. And <IT>Schism</IT> is a Thing of so <IT>ugly</IT> and <IT>horrid</IT> an <IT>Aspect</IT>, that it is not a Wonder, if They that have rashly <IT>espous'd</IT> it, think fit to give it a <IT>Paint</IT>; tho all the World knows, It is not its Natural <IT>Colour</IT>, and it plainly appears to be <IT>Dawbing</IT>. We have been now so <IT>Civil</IT> and <IT>Gentile</IT> to our Adversaries, as to <IT>clean</IT> our selves of that <IT>Dirt</IT>, which they themselves cast upon us, before We are to enter upon the <IT>Struggle</IT>. You may tell 'em, <IT>Sir</IT>, We are ready and prepar'd to <IT>close in</IT>, whensoever they please to come on. We are not Concern'd at what you say, That They are Great Men, <IT>Men of War from their Youth</IT>. For what avail the greatest Abilities, what avails the strongest <IT>Confederacy</IT>, when a Cause is not capable of Defence? What avails a great deal of Strength, when, like <IT>Mito</IT>, they are caught in an <IT>Oak</IT>? It is not, <IT>Sir</IT>, to be admir'd, that they that are engag'd in this <IT>Schism</IT> are so little mov'd and perswaded by the many Examples of <PB

In short, <IT>Sir</IT>, I must tell ye; The <IT>Place</IT>, before which we ly, has, to Me, no other Appearance (you will pardon, <IT>Sir</IT>, the <IT>youthful</IT> Comparison) but that of a <IT>Castle En&rehy;chanted</IT>, and I shall not pretend to be so <IT>Romantick</IT> a <IT>Champion</IT> as to force it to a <IT>Surrender</IT>.

<P>That We may not run on and mispend our Time, and Abuse the Patience of our Readers by Discourses not properly pertinent and close to the Matter depend&rehy;ing; When you meet with any of our <IT>Learned</IT> Adver&rehy;saries, the <IT>Emeriti</IT> of this Schism, who, you say, are publishing an <IT>Answer</IT> to our Treatise, and writing a Defence of their Revolt, Be pleas'd, <IT>Sir</IT>, to 
<GAP REASON="overstrike" EXTENT="ca. 25 chars"> desire 'em to demonstrate, if they can, the Two general <IT>Propositions</IT> which follow.</P>
<P>1. <IT>That the Civil Government has not any Autho&rehy;rity in it self to deprive a Bishop of his Bishoprick, who refuses to own it, and to submit to it</IT>. And here they <PB
N="20">are desired to consider, that the <IT>Civil Power</IT> or the <IT>Temporal Governor</IT> are no less of God's own Institu&rehy;tion than <IT>Bishops</IT> or the <IT>Governors of the Church</IT>, that both are equally <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Jure Divino</FOREIGN> with this onely differ&rehy;ence, that the former are instituted by God for our Peace and Happiness here in this World, the latter to conduct us to Happiness in that which is to come; That the <IT>Secular</IT> Government is antecedent to the <IT>Spiritual</IT>; That when Christ came into the world to establish a Church, he came not to abolish any Law that was necessary for the support of the Secu&rehy;lar Government, not to set up a Church that was any ways opposite to it; But that he himself submit&rehy;ted to the Secular Government which he found establisht, and commanded his Followers to do so; That after his Death the Apostles likewise did so, and commanded likewise all their Followers and Suc&rehy;cessors to do the same, to submit to the Temporal Power <IT>as the Ordinance of God</IT>. It is plain that our Sa&rehy;viour by establishing a Church, intended the establish&rehy;ment of such things onely as might well consist with the Safety and the <IT>Essentials</IT> of Government. From hence it follows, that none has receiv'd any Power or Commission from Christ to preach the Gospel, or to preside over the Church in any Country, but with this <IT>Supposition</IT>, and on this <IT>Condition</IT>, that he own and submit to the Temporal Government which God has ordained in that Country. It is, I say, with this <IT>Supposition</IT>, That he gives his Bishops, and his Ministers, a Commission to preside over the Church, and to preach his Gospel in such or such a Country; It is upon the same Condition that the Church ap&rehy;points 'em to preside or preach in that Place; and it is upon the same Condition that they are receiv'd, <PB
N="21">allow'd off, and protected by the State. If there&rehy;fore they fail of the Performance of that necessary Condition, their <IT>Commission</IT> then ceases as to that particular Government, which they cannot, or will not submit to. They become Deprivable by the State, and the Church is to constitute others who are willing to submit to the State, and whom the State shall approve of as fit to be trusted by it in that Post. Thus for Matters of Heresy; Christ has given no Authority to any to preach in his Name, or to govern in his Church, but on this <IT>Condition</IT>, that they preach and maintain the true Faith. If that <IT>Condition</IT> be not observ'd, the Church is then to de&rehy;prive 'em. In the Case of Heresy it belongs to the Church to Deprive, that being the proper Judge of that Question, What is the true Faith? In the Case of Rebellion, or of Non-submission to the Government, it belongs to the Government, as being the proper Judge of what is necessary for its own Support.</P>
<P>I lay down this as a <IT>Principle</IT>, on which both the Power of the Church, of Depriving for <IT>Spiritual</IT>, and likewise the Power of the State, of Depriving for <IT>Political</IT> Crimes, does depend.</P>
<P><IT>Query</IT>, What Security the <IT>Civil Government</IT>, which is God's own Institution, and antecedent to the <IT>Ec&rehy;clesiastical</IT>, can have, if a Bishop, that refuses to own it, and submit to its Authority, may not be De&rehy;priv'd by it? What Security can it have, Especially considering, that Men of that Character are gene&rehy;rally Persons of very great Power and Authority, and may easily go a great way in the Subversion of a Government, by the Influence of their Eloquence, and their great Reputation for Learning and Piety? In such a Case is the Bishop to be Depriv'd by a Synod <PB
N="22">of Bishops? Here a Second <IT>Query</IT> will follow. What if <IT>all</IT> the Bishops, that are under a Government should conspire against it? And what if we suppose, that there's onely one Bishop within the Bounds of that Government, a thing that has often happen'd; What must be done in that Case? Will our Adversa&rehy;ries grant, that supposing a Bishop should conspire against the Government or Rebel, the Government has Authority to imprison him, or to banish him; but not to <IT>Deprive</IT> him of his Bishoprick, so as that another may be plac'd in his See? If this be the Plea of our Adversaries, I shall then desire to be satisfied in one <IT>Query</IT> more. How does this consist with the Nature and End of Church Government? How can He continue a Pastor that is <IT>utterly</IT> banish'd from his Flock, and render'd <IT>utterly</IT> uncapable of doing the Duty of his Charge? Shall the Neighbour Bishops be his Delegates, and act by his Power and Autho&rehy;rity? But what if we recur to our former Suppo&rehy;sition, that all the Bishops of a Kingdom are Rebels? When they are all banish'd by the State, who then must govern the Church? Who <IT>ordain</IT>, and do other Duties that are proper to a Bishop? Or supposing that there is but one Bishop; when he is sent into perpetual Banishment, how must his Office be sup&rehy;ply'd? When in the first Planting of the Christian Religion in the several Parts of the World there was onely one Bishop in a Country, as at first in many Countries there was onely one, if that one had been banish'd for Rebellion, pray, what should the Chri&rehy;stians there planted have done? Should they have liv'd without Bishop during all his Life that was banish'd, or ought they not rather to have got a new one to govern 'em, to supply the Church with inferi<PB
N="23">our Clergy, and the like? Here, <IT>Sir</IT>, I shall put you in mind of those words of the great St. <IT>Chrysostom</IT>, which are urg'd in the Preface to the <IT>Oxford An&rehy;tiquity</IT>; when he was unjustly banish'd he charg'd his People, That <IT>as they hop'd for Salvation</IT>, they should be obedient to that Bishop who should succeed him as to himself, <IT>For the Church</IT>, says he, <IT>cannot be with&rehy;out a Bishop</IT>. And yet it is certain, that that great Man did never <IT>resign</IT> his Bishoprick, but continued to act as a Bishop of the Catholick Church during all the time of his Banishment, that is, as long as he liv'd. I shall onely add, that if the Banishment of a Bishop be no design'd to be perpetual, as that of St. <IT>Chry&rehy;sostom</IT> was, but onely for a Time, then there may not be any Necessity that another should be plac'd in his See. And this was the Reason, why, when St. <IT>Athanasius</IT>, the Patriarch of <IT>Alexandria</IT>, was banish'd by the Emperour <IT>Constantine</IT>, there was no new Pa&rehy;triarch created. That He was banish'd onely for a Time, and that the Emperour <IT>Constantine</IT> intended to recall him, and to re&rehy;store him to his Bishoprick, is expressly attested by the Younger Emperour <IT>Constan&rehy;tine</IT> in his <NOTE

<P>The Solution, <IT>Sir</IT>, of these <IT>Queries</IT>, which I have propos'd, will prove, if I am not mistaken, a work of no great Ease. I should gladly see the <IT>Knot</IT> fairly <IT>untied</IT>, without any <IT>Cutting</IT> and Violence. We will see on the contrary, if you please, how easily those <IT>Knots</IT> may be <IT>loos'd</IT>, which our Adversaries are wont to present us, as the greatest effects of their <IT>Skill</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Ob.</IT> 1. How does it consist with the Safety of the Church and of Religion, if the Secular Governour has Authority to turn out a Bishop? Then all Bishops may depend on his Sentence, and the Church and Religion be <IT>precarious</IT>. An <IT>Orthodox</IT> Bishop may be depos'd, and a <IT>Heretick</IT> placed in his See.</P>
<P><IT>Ans.</IT> It cannot be avoided but that the Church and Religion must be always, in some measure, Precari&rehy;ous, and depend upon the Civil Magistrat. If the Governour be an Enemy to Religion, there is no a&rehy;voiding Oppression, wheresoever we lodge the true Power of Depriving a Bishop. Now to answer di&rehy;rectly the Objection: If the Civil Governour should turn out our <IT>Orthodox</IT> Bishops, and put in <IT>Hereticks</IT> in their Places, or put in none at all in their places, then the Church is obliged to adhere to the old Ones turn'd out, or, if there be a necessity, to procure new Ones <PB
N="25">that are <IT>Orthodox</IT>. Thus if the Civil Magistrat should forbid the Christian Religion to be preach'd in his Country, he is not to be obey'd, because it is the Will of our Saviour that his Gospel should be preach'd to all Nations, as far as the Preaching of it does consist with those <IT>Rules</IT> that are truly <IT>essential</IT> to Government. And when <IT>Decius</IT> the Emperour aim'd to root out the Christian Religion in the City of <IT>Rome</IT> by destroying the Bishop <IT>Fabianus</IT>, and for&rehy;biding that any new Bishop should be Created in his Place; there was no Obligation on the Christians of that Church to obey his Will or Decree, since they did not pretend to choose such a Person as refus'd to submit to his Government. And therefore, tho they defer'd the Election of a new Bishop for above Sixteen Months, for fear of the Emperour, who then resided at <IT>Rome,</IT> <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Propter rerum & temporum difficultates</FOREIGN>, as the <IT>Clergy</IT> tell St. <IT>Cyprian</IT> in a Letter, yet as soon as the Emperour was engag'd in a Civil War, and had therefore remov'd from that City, they set about an Election, and plac'd <IT>Cornelius</IT> in the Chair. This Principle will secure Religion from depending on the Will of a Governour no less than that of our Ad&rehy;versaries, who would have Bishops to be Deprivable onely by Bishops. That likewise may have its ill Consequences, for what if those Bishops, who are suppos'd to Deprive another, should themselves be Heretical, or no true Friends of the Church?</P>
<P>This Rule is still to be observ'd, that neither the <IT>Civil</IT> nor the <IT>Ecclesiastical Power</IT> may so far <IT>usurp</IT> upon one another as to lessen that Authority which is ne&rehy;cessary for the <IT>Subsistence</IT> of Each. Where on either side their Pretensions exceed their due Bounds, there all there Authority ceases. We must neither erect a <PB
N="26"><IT>Protestant</IT> Popedom, nor yet an <IT>Erastian</IT> Kingdom: Not so <IT>interpret</IT> one <IT>Text</IT> as <ADD
RESP="errata">to</ADD> make it <IT>fall out</IT> with another. There is, as in other Things, so likewise in this, a sort of an <IT>Analogy of Faith</IT>: As they both pro&rehy;ceed from God, so they cannot in their own Natures disagree in the least. Neither must there such <IT>Maxims</IT> be advanc'd as may make 'em <IT>wage War</IT> with one another. So to order the <IT>Temporal</IT> Government as not to have Regard to the <IT>Spiritual</IT>, is <IT>Prophaness, Irreligion</IT> and <IT>Atheism</IT>; and to lay down such Rules in Favour of the <IT>Spiritual</IT> as that it may <IT>Top</IT> upon the <IT>Temporal</IT> is no less a <IT>Crime</IT> than it is a <IT>Vanity</IT>. In a Word: He cannot <IT>give to God</IT> all <IT>the Things that are Gods</IT>, that does not <IT>give to Cesar the Things that are Cesars</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Ob.</IT> 2. But it is not in the power of the Civil Go&rehy;vernment to take away that which it could not give, the <IT>Orders</IT> and Character of a Bishop.</P>
<P><IT>Answ.</IT> This Objection supposes that when a Bishop is depriv'd of his particular Bishoprick, his <IT>Orders</IT> are taken away, and he is not any longer a Bishop. If the thing be so; look they to it, who refuse to submit to the Civil Government which God has set over 'em. It appears from what has been said, that our Saviour has given no Commission to exercise the Office of a Bishop in such a particular Place, but to such as sub&rehy;mit to the Government of that Country in which they reside: and if they are not Bishops but in that one Place where first they were design'd to preside, if they have not (I say) any larger Commission, then whenever they refuse to acknowledge the Civil Go&rehy;vernment, their whole Commission is void, and they are not any longer Bishops. They are not depriv'd of their Orders by the Civil Power, but their Com&rehy;mission which they receiv'd from Christ to exercise <PB
N="27">the Office of a Bishop in that particular Place, is of it self void, as being given only on <IT>Condition</IT>, as soon as they <IT>appear</IT> to be Enemies to the Government, and are so declar'd. Look they, I say, to that. But it is not our opinion, that a Bishop is utterly <IT>Degraded</IT> whensoever he is justly <IT>Depriv'd</IT>. Neither is it agree&rehy;able to the Notions and Practice of our Church. For if the Character of a Bishop does depend upon the having a Bishoprick, how can a Bishop remain a Bishop after Resignation? How can he be restor'd after (lawful) Deprivation without a new Ordina&rehy;tion? How can he be translated without a new Ordi&rehy;nation from one Bishoprick to another, if, when he was Ordain'd, he was only Ordain'd to this or that particular Bishoprick? How can he <IT>Ordain</IT>, or do the Offices of a Bishop, out of his own Diocess? If the People of his City or Diocess should be all destroy'd by Wars, or be utterly disperst and lost, how can he remain invested with the Character of a Bishop? And as it is not agreeable to the Doctrine and Practice of our Church, so neither to the general Notions and Practice of the Ancients, as shall easily and plainly be made out, as soon as Occasion is given. At pre&rehy;sent it will be enough, to remind you of what is a&rehy;bove observ'd concerning St. <IT>Chrysostom</IT>.</P>
<P>Tho it be not my Design at present to enter upon the Authority of the Antients, yet I cannot forbear to take notice of a very strange Weakness of Judg&rehy;ment (for so I must call it) which <IT>Lucifer Calaritanus</IT> has discover'd in his Books to the Emp. <IT>Constantius in behalf of St. Athanasius</IT>. He affirms, amongst other things, that another Bishop ought not to be put into St. <IT>Athanasius's</IT> Place, as was done at that time, be&rehy;cause <IT>Athanasius</IT> was living. By which he seems to <PB
N="28">intimate that a Bishop could not be at all <IT>Depriv'd</IT>; but his meaning is, that he could not be Depriv'd by the Emperor.  So he says:<NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="inline" ANCHORED="NO"><Q REND="it" LANG="LAT">Persequeris eum per quem te audire pr&aelig;cepe&rehy;rit Dominus, agente eo in rebus humanis, coh&aelig;&rehy;reticum tuum Georgium mittis Successorem, cum tametsi fuisset liberatus jam Athanasius & corpore (l.&egrave; Corp.) tibi non licuerit mitte&rehy;re, sed fuerit ac sit in Dei manu, quem fuisset dignatus populo suo antistitem instituere, per servos viz. suos, hoc est Catholicos Episcopos.

He does not pre&rehy;tend to Traditi&rehy;on, or to lay it down as the Do&rehy;ctrine of the An&rehy;cients; but so he thinks fit to say, as being too angry to allow the Prince any <IT>Prerogative</IT>, and he proves it from hence, that <IT>Jo&rehy;suah did not succeed Moses till Moses was dead</IT>. What a strange Demon&rehy;stration that is! Yet so bad as it is, it holds as well against a Deprivation by Bishops, and likewise against a Deprivation <IT>by the People of the Diocess</IT>, which <IT>Lucifer</IT> himself in ano&rehy;ther place owns to be lawful, as against a Depriva&rehy;tion by the Prince: and so bad as it is, it is full as good, as a great many other Arguments, which are urg'd from the Scripture by that over Passionat, tho Orthodox, Bishop. It is true, that the Emperor did very ill in turning out St. <IT>Athanasius</IT> unjustly, and in <PB
N="29">putting in a Heretick into his Place. This we know. It is likewise true, that our Author deserv'd very well for his Zeal against the <IT>Arian</IT> Hereticks: But this however I must say, that he manages the Cause with much more <IT>Heat</IT> and <IT>Irreverence</IT> than <IT>Judgment</IT>. We may dare to affirm he had no great stock of the latter: And it is not at all to be wonder'd at, that He after&rehy;wards prov'd a <IT>Schismatick</IT>. Tis further alleg'd by the same Author against the said Persecuting Em&rehy;peror, that instead of being a Judge in the Cause of a Bishop, he ought by the Law of God to be <IT>Con&rehy;demn'd to Death</IT> for not submitting to the Doctrin of the Catholick Bishops. And this he proves from that place in <IT>Deuteronomy</IT> where God commands, that they that did not obey the <IT>Priests</IT> should be put to death; tho the Text be no other than this: (<IT>Deut.</IT> 17.12.) <q rend=it>And the Man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest (that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God) <ro>nor unto the Judge,</ro> even that man shall dy, and <CORR
SIC="thon">thou</CORR> shalt put away the evil from Israel</q>. After all I must add, That the Cruelty of that Emperor <IT>Constantius</IT> to the Catholick Bishops, may be pleaded to excuse both <IT>Lucifer</IT>, who himself suf&rehy;fer'd Banishment, and also some other Bishops of that Age, who were so far provok'd as to deny that the Emperor had any Authority at all over Bishops; For, as <IT>Solomon</IT> says,<q rend=it>Oppression maketh a Wise man mad</q>.</P>
<P>Here, <IT>Sir</IT>, it comes into my mind, what you men&rehy;tion in your Letter concerning St. <IT>Cyprian</IT>, That there's nothing more usual with the Advocates for the New Separation, than to plead upon all Occa&rehy;sions the Authority of that excellent Father. 'Tis, <IT>Sir</IT>, a <IT>merry</IT> Question, that which you are pleas'd to ask me, Whether ever he wrote a Treatise by way <PB
N="30">of <IT>Prophecy</IT> for the Cause of our Adversaries? One would think so, you say, by the Confidence and Tri&rehy;umph of those that are wont to quote him. I shall answer you, <IT>Sir</IT>, in short, but with a great deal of <IT>Se&rehy;riousness</IT>, that there is not a Word in St. <IT>Cyprian</IT> that makes a <IT>Whit</IT> for their Cause. I will give you, ac&rehy;cording to your Desire, a particular account of the meaning of all those Passages, which you say are usually alleg'd, and of the Occasion why they were written. You will then see, that even the greatest and learnedest men (for such, you tell me, some of the Quoters of St. <IT>Cyprian</IT> are) are in some respects no better than the <IT>Many</IT>; that when they are <IT>drowning</IT> and <IT>sinking</IT>, they will catch at <IT>Straws</IT> no less than other People.</P>
<P>The Words which you say are commonly quoted by our Adversaries out of St. <IT>Cyprian</IT> are</P>

How could they pretend to have Power to turn that Presbyter again out of the Church, as they plainly intimate they had?

If a Patri&rehy;arch or Metropolitan can Deprive a Bishop by the Authority of the Church, why may not a <IT>Lay-Judge</IT> do the like?
<PB N="37"></P><P>I shall close this Discourse concerning the Autho&rehy;rity of that Father, with that Question or Expostu&rehy;lation which I find in St. <IT>Augustine</IT> his 48.

In the same Epistle ha&rehy;ving quoted that place of St. <IT>Cyprian</IT> where he praises those <IT>African</IT> Bishops that refus'd to re-admit Adul&rehy;terers into the Church, yet did not break the Peace of the Church, and separate from those that were of a different Opinion, he adds, what likewise we may well say to our Quoters of St. <IT>Cyprian: What say you to this, Brother</IT> Vincentius? <IT>You see that this Man, this peaceful Bishop, and most valiant Martyr, was not more concern'd for any thing, than least the bond of Unity should be broken</IT>.

Yet this I shall demonstrat, that, tho in the time of <IT>Constantius</IT> some persecuted Bishops were pleas'd to deny that the Emperour had any Authority at all over Bishops, yet the Emperour <IT>Constantine</IT> himself (so great a Lover and Honorer of Bishops as he was) and likewise the succeeding <IT>Orthodox</IT> Emperours, did oftentimes Judge and Deprive Bishops by their own bare Authority: That the Church in the time of that Emperour, as well as in after Ages, submitted to and acknowledg'd that Authority: That those Ecclesiasti&rehy;cal <IT>Canons</IT> which ordain that Bishops (even for Po&rehy;litical Crimes) are to be depriv'd onely by Bishops, did never oblige any Secular Government, but as they were allow'd off, and so made <IT>Laws</IT>, by that Government. I could willingly give you a <IT>Foretast</IT> of a few illustrious Examples of Bishops depriv'd by the Emperour's sole Authority, and the Church's owning and acknowledging that Authority; but I find I have already exceeded what first I design'd on this Subject, and have done like a great many others, who, designing onely a <IT>Lodge</IT>, have been in danger of building 'em a <IT>Seat</IT>. I shall now proceed to the second general Proposition which our Adversaries are desir'd to make out, which is this,</P>
<P>2. <IT>That it is agreeable to the Practice of the Ancient Christians, for a Bishop unjustly depos'd</IT> (whether by the Emperour, or by Bishops) <IT>to withdraw himself from the Communion of his Successor tho' his Successor were not a Heretick</IT>. Let this be their Proposition: If they prove not that, they prove nothing. And the contrary is plainly demonstrated in our Treatise. <PB
N="39">There are Two things, you tell me, besides the <IT>Ca&rehy;nons</IT> above spoken off, which our Adversaries are wont to allege in Answer to that Treatise. They First endeavour to weaken the Authority of it, and Secondly they pretend that the Examples which it produces, are all of Bishops <IT>Synodically</IT> depriv'd, and therefore not to our Purpose. In answer to this se&rehy;cond Exception, I shall undertake to demonstrat these Two things.</P>
<P>1. <IT>That the Ancients had no greater regard to an unjust Synodical Deprivation, than they had to an unjust Impe&rehy;rial Deprivation</IT>.</P>
<P>2. <IT>That several of those Bishops that are mention'd in our Treatise, were not Depriv'd Synodically, or by Bishops, but by the Emperour's sole Power and Authority</IT>. Neither did they <IT>resign</IT> their Bishopricks, but were violently turn'd out.</P>
<P>As for the Objections of our Adversaries against the Authority of our Treatise, tho' I know not of any Treatise of that age and nature that deserves to be more esteem'd, yet to wave all impertinent Di&rehy;sputes, and to shew that what we assert is not ground&rehy;ed on that onely Bottom; we will fairly make 'em this Offer: We will lay aside, if they please, the Autho&rehy;rity of that Treatise, and enter the <IT>Lists</IT> with new <IT>Weapons</IT>. This is the Proposition we shall take upon us to demonstrat:</P>
<P><IT>That its contrary to the general Practice of the ancient Bishops, to recede, upon their being unjustly Depriv'd whether by the Emperour onely or by a Synod, from the Communion of an Orthodox Successor</IT>. I say, the <IT>gene&rehy;ral</IT> Practice: That's enough for us to demonstrat. For what if our Adversaries can produce us one or two Exceptions? How will that excuse Bishops who <PB
N="40">have always profest a great and due regard for the <IT>general</IT> Practice of the Ancients.</P>
<P>I must not conclude before I have told you, as I promis'd you, what <IT>Schism</IT> that was which was rais'd upon the account of <IT>Josephus the Presbyter</IT>, which, as appears by <IT>Cotelerius's</IT> Copy, was the occasion of the writing our Treatise. You must know, <IT>Sir</IT>, in short, that in the Year 1266. <IT>Arsenius</IT> the Patr. of <IT>CP.</IT> was depos'd by a <IT>Synod</IT>, whereof the Emp. <IT>Michael Pal&aelig;&rehy;ologus</IT> sat <IT>President</IT>, partly for certain Crimes of which he was accus'd, but chiefly for Contumacy in refu&rehy;sing to give his Appearance. He knew that the Em&rehy;perour was his Enemy, and therefore he pleaded that 'twas contrary to the <IT>Canons</IT> for Him to sit Judge in the Cause of a Bishop. The <IT>Synod</IT> (a very great one) both acknowledg'd, and asserted the Emperour's Au&rehy;thority, and alledg'd, it was agreeable both to <IT>Reason</IT> and the <IT>Practice of the Ancients. Germanus</IT> Bishop of <IT>Adrianople</IT>, who was put into <IT>Arsenius's</IT> Place, resign&rehy;ing after a few Months, <IT>Josephus</IT>, the Emperour's Confessor and an Abbot, was advanc'd to that Honour. Hence arose a famous <IT>Schism</IT> amongst the Monks and the Common-people, some adhering to <IT>Arsenius</IT>, as unjustly Depriv'd, others being averse to <IT>Josephus</IT> because they lookt upon him to have been formerly Excommunicated by <IT>Arsenius</IT> and not yet Absolv'd, and others pretending other Reasons. I said, <IT>Amongst the Monks and Common-people</IT>; for <IT>Pachymeres</IT> assures us, tho' a Friend and Well-wisher to <IT>Arsenius</IT>, that in all the Church there were but Three Bishops that engag'd in the Schism, <IT>viz.</IT> those of <IT>Alexandria, Thes&rehy;salonica</IT> and <IT>Sardis</IT>. Of whom, the two last were the especial Friends and <IT>Creatures</IT> of <IT>Arsenius</IT>. Nei&rehy;ther did those Bishops make a Schism because ano<PB
N="41">ther Bishop was put into <IT>Arsenius's</IT> Place, whilst he was alive; for they presently began it, as it plainly appears from <IT>Pachymeres</IT>, as soon as <IT>Arsenius</IT> was de&rehy;priv'd, before his Place was fill'd up; that is, they withdrew from the Communion (not of the Church in general, but onely) of those Bishops that Depriv'd Him: so <IT>Pachymeres</IT> expressly says of the Bishop of <IT>Alexandria</IT>. &horfill; Those Persons that refus'd to Communicate with <IT>Josephus</IT> upon the Account of <IT>Arse&rehy;nius's</IT> Deprivation, the Author of our Treatise en&rehy;deavours to convince, by shewing by many Exam&rehy;ples of Bishops unjustly Depriv'd, part of them by <IT>Synods</IT>, and part by the Emperour alone, how con&rehy;trary it was to the Practice of the Ancients to violate the Peace of the Church on the account of such un&rehy;just or uncanonical Deprivations.</P>
<P>Being now assur'd what <IT>Schism</IT> that was, that oc&rehy;casion'd the writing of our <IT>Treatise</IT>, we cannot any longer be ignorant of the true <IT>Age</IT> of the <IT>Author</IT>. It cannot reasonably be doubted, but that our <IT>Treatise</IT> was written about the beginning of the <IT>Schism</IT>, and of <IT>Josephus's</IT> Patriarchate, <IT>viz.</IT> in the Year 1267. for <IT>Josephus</IT> was consecrated Patriarch the First of <IT>Janu&rehy;ary</IT> 1266/7 as may easily be shewn, tho' <IT>Petrus Possinus</IT> would have it to be a Year later. This at least is ap&rehy;parent, that 'twas writ before the death of <IT>Arsenius</IT> which happen'd on the last of <IT>Sept.</IT> 1273. for it plain&rehy;ly appears from the Treatise, that the Patriarch, for whose sake the Schism was rais'd, was <IT>alive</IT> when the Treatise was writ. It may further be gather'd out of the Sixth Book of <IT>Nicephorus Gregoras</IT>, that this Schism lasted no longer than the Year 1275. for he tells us the manner how it was ended, just after he had spoken of <IT>Gregorius</IT> (Georgius) <PB
N="42"><IT>Cyprius's</IT> being promoted to the Patriarchate, and before he speaks of the Patriarch <IT>Veccus's</IT> Banish&rehy;ment; which happen'd both on the foresaid Year. Here, <IT>Sir</IT>, I must retract what I formerly con&rehy;jectur'd (tho very <IT>doubtingly</IT>) in my <IT>Preface</IT> to the <IT>Gr.</IT> and <IT>Lat. Edition</IT>, concerning <IT>Nicephorus Callisti</IT> his being the Author of our Treatise. For from what has been said it is manifest, that the Author of our Treatise was older than <IT>Nicephorus Callisti</IT>. For <IT>Ni&rehy;cephorus</IT> was not full 36. Years old when he publisht his <IT>Eccl. History</IT>, and yet when he publisht it, <IT>An&rehy;dronicus</IT> the Emperour (Son to the abovesaid <IT>Michael Pal.</IT>) who died in the Year 1327. near 70. Years of Age, was a <IT>very old Man</IT>, as he plainly declares in his <NOTE

To which may <PB
N="43">be added, that the Predecessor of <IT>Macedonius</IT>, that was depos'd by the Emp. <IT>Anastasius</IT>, is by <IT>Nicephorus</IT> both in his <IT>Catalogue</IT> and his <IT>Hist.</IT> nam'd <IT>Euphe&rehy;mius</IT> (as the more ancient Writers are wont to call him) but by the Author of our Treatise, <IT>Euthymius</IT>.

I do not won&rehy;der, <IT>Sir</IT>, you should so far forget that <IT>Pamphlet</IT>, when you wrote your Letter, as to throw it down to a <IT>Post&rehy;script</IT>, I rather wonder you should ever mind it at all, but above all I wonder, how you came to be so far forgetful of the Humour of your old Acquaintance, as to ask me that Question. How often have you heard me say, That I hate to <IT>strike</IT> on a Thing that is <IT>Hollow</IT> and <IT>Empty</IT>, which can onely return <IT>Noise</IT>! The Author of that Pamphlet is too much a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Felo de se</FOREIGN> to need the Hand of an Adversary. How excellently does he infer from one or two Mistakes, which he en&rehy;deavours to discover in our Treatise, that all the rest is nothing but <IT>Error</IT> and <IT>Blunder</IT>! An incomparable <IT>Ergo</IT>! A rare <IT>Logician</IT>! How pleasant is it to observe <PB
