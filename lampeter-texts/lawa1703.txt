<P rend=it><RO>&Cic;Harles Hore</RO>, the Complainer in the following Case, did in the Year <RO>1701</RO> make Complaint to the <RO>House of Commons</RO>, of a great Abuse Com&rehy;mitted in Her Majesty's Brew-house at <RO>St. Katharines</RO>; which Complaint was Referr'd to the Consideration of a Committee, who consider'd the matter of Fact, and Reported in special to the House, as follows;</P><QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><P><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Mercurij</FOREIGN> 18. <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Die Martij</FOREIGN>, 1701.</P>
<P rend=it>Mr. <RO>Edward Harley</RO>, according to Order, Reported, from the Committee ap&rehy;pointed to Examine into the Matter of the Complaint of a great Abuse Committed in Her Majesty's Brew-house at <RO>St. Katharines</RO>, the matter of Fact as it appeared to them; which they had directed him to Report to the House, which he Read in his place, and afterwards Delivered it in at the Table, where the same was Read.
</P><P>Resolved,</P>
<P>That it appears to this House, That there hath been a great Abuse Committed in Her Majesty's Brew-house at St. <IT>Katharines</IT>, by Drawing off the first Worts, to the Defrauding of Her Majesty, and Prejudice of the Seamen.</P>
<P>Resolved,</P>
<P>That the pretence of taking Perquisites in Her Majesty's Office of Victu&rehy;alling, tends much to the Prejudice of Her Majesty's Service.</P>
<P>Ordered,</P>
<P>That the said Resolution be laid before Her Majesty (by way of Ad&rehy;dress) by such Members of this House, as are of Her Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council.</P></BODY></TEXT></QUOTE>
<P>The Nature of this Complaint was, That the Officers and others belong&rehy;ing to the Brew-house, did take from the several Guiles of Sea Beer, Brewed for the Service of the Navy, large Quantities of the strongest and best Worts, for their own Use, and by the Addition of Water, made up the number of Barrels in each Guile; so that the Sailors had their full proportion of Drink, but the Strength and Heart of the Beer was left behind in the Officers Cellars.</P>
<P><IT>Hore</IT> made this Complaint in the first place to the Commissioners of Excise, who laid the same before the Commissioners of Victualling, as also sent their Officers to Enquire into the Fraud, who found it matter of Fact: And Mr. <IT>Denniston</IT>, a General Surveyor of the Excise, and several of his Officers, plainly proved the Fraud before the Committee of Parliament from their own Books; and gave the Committee a particular Account of the Strong Beer thus Embezell'd from the Sailors; which they found Con&rehy;ceal'd in the Officers Cellars, and in private Ware-Houses, in the Brew&rehy;House.</P>
<P><IT>Note</IT>, That notwithstanding this Complaint was laid before the Com&rehy;missioners of Excise and Victualling, as also before the Admiralty, no Justice was done the Nation in this particular, till such time as the Complaint had pass'd the Examination of Parliament; but on the Contrary, the Persons Complained against, were continued in their several Employments in the Brew-House.</P>
<P><IT>Note also</IT>, That by this Complaint, <IT>Hore</IT> saved the Nation at least Ten Thousand Pounds <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Ann.</FOREIGN></IT> by the Redress of the Complaint in the Brew&rehy;House, and by taking away the illegal Perquisites of the Officers by Vote of Parliament; for which Service he had only the Sum of One Hundred Pounds given him by the Lord High Treasurer; which Sum he had Ex&rehy;pended in the Prosecution of the Complaint in the several Offices, and at Parliament, besides his Loss of Time; all which did not Discourage him from making the following Complaint for the good of his Country.</P></DIV></FRONT>

<p>&Tic;Hat after Sir <IT>Richard Haddock</IT>, and Mr. <IT>Henry Greenhill</IT>, and others, by Order of Your Royal Highness, had Surveyed Her Majesties Stores and Provisions at the Victualling-Office, and in and about the Port of <IT>London</IT>; and a Report was given in to Your Royal Highnesses Council, that the said Stores were Extreamly Good, and fit for Her Majesties Service: Your Petitioner being assured of the Contrary, the said Surveyors having not Examined into all Her Majesties Stores, but that Considerable part of the said Stores were Concealed in Private Ware-Houses, did protest against the said Survey, a Copy whereof he delivered in at the Admiralty Board, to be Trans&rehy;mitted to Your Royal Highness.
</P><P>Your Petitioner afterwards Petitioned Her Most Excellent Majesty in Council, set&rehy;ting forth several great Hardships to Her Majesties good Subjects, who had given In&rehy;formation in Relation to several Discoveries of several Frauds and Abuses Committed in Her Majesties Victualling Office: And Her Majesty was Graciously Pleased to Refer the Petition aforesaid, to the Consideration of the <IT>Attorney</IT> and <IT>Solicitor</IT> General, who, upon hearing the whole matter, Declared, the Allegations in the Petition were fully proved; tho' not yet Reported to Her Majesty in Council.</P>
<P>Your Petitioner in the mean Time (being Zealous and Resolute in Her Majesties Service) Procured a Warrant from a Justice of Peace to Seize, and accordingly hath Seized several Hundreds of Tuns of Her Majesties Provisions in Ware-Houses, at <IT>Cuckolds-Point</IT>: Supposed to be Concealed and Embezzel'd.</P>

<QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><P rend=it>The Report of us, whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, being Inhabitants within the City and Liberty of <RO>Westminster</RO>, Touching a Survey of Sea Provisions (in&rehy;tended for Her Majesties Ser&rehy;vice) made on the 17th and 19th of <RO>July, 1703</RO>. In a Private Ware-House, at or near <RO>Cuckolds-Point</RO>, which Provisions were seized (as supposed) to be Embezzel'd from Her Majesties Stores.
</P><p>&Tic;Hat upon Inspection of the Provisions aforesaid, the Major Part of them Appeared to us, to the best of our Judgement and Knowledge, to be killed since <IT>Michaelmas</IT> last, (tho' at this time they are Stinking) and are altogether unfit for Her Majesties Ser<PB
N="14">vice; for this Reason, that upon opening the Casks, the Pickle appeared to be in a manner all Blood, which was Stinking and very Offensive; and the Flesh appeared to be Fresh, as if it had not been Salted above two Months: The Dammage of which Provisions is Occasioned for want of due care in Salting and Packing them; the Blood never having been Drained, nor the Salt ever Penetrated the Flesh: Whereas every Cock-Wench knows, that Flesh not mov'd or Repackt out of the Bloody Pickle, can never keep sweet six Months.
</P><P>We further declare that during the time of the said Survey, one <IT>Skipper Holman</IT> pre&rehy;tended he had bought the said Provisions and said that all were Rogues who came there, especially Mr. <IT>Hore</IT>, whose Ears he swore he would cut off, and Arrest him for five&rehy;Pound a Day, for every Day he waited there, being so much out of his way, and was very Impertinent and Troublesome. And one Mr. <IT>Cole</IT>, the Master Cooper of the Victua&rehy;ling Office; and likewise Mr. <IT>Jennings</IT>, one of the Commissioners, pretended the said Provisions were Condemned at <IT>Portsmouth</IT>, and sent up hither, and Repackt out of good Husbandry, to serve as petty Warrant Provisions for new Imprest Men Aboard the Tenders, with such like Various Discourses. But we Humbly Presume, stinking Pro&rehy;visions are never designed by Her Majesty and Government, or Imprest Men, or the <IT>West-Indies</IT>, or to destroy any of Her Subjects, in any of Her Majesties Dominions, Here or Elsewhere.</P>
