<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF <IT>FREE-THINKING</IT> IN <SC>Mathematics</SC>; <IT>&amp;c.</IT></HEAD>
<P><LABEL>I.</LABEL> &Wic;HEN I read your Defence of the <IT>British</IT> Mathematicians, I could not, Sir, but admire your Courage in asserting with such undoubting Assurance things so easily disproved. This to me seemed unaccountable, till I reflected on what you say (<IT>p.</IT> 32.) when upon my having appealed to every thinking Reader, whe&rehy;ther it be possible to frame any clear Con&rehy;ception of Fluxions, you express yourself in the following manner, <Q>"Pray, Sir, who are those thinking Readers you ap<PB
N="4">
peal to? Are they Geometricians, or Persons wholly ignorant of Geometry? If the former, I leave it to them: If the latter, I ask how well are they qualified to judge of the Method of Fluxions"?</Q> It must be acknowledged you seem by this Dilemma secure in the favour of one Part of your Readers, and the ignorance of the other. I am nevertheless persuaded there are fair and candid Men among the Ma&rehy;thematicians. And for those who are not Mathematicians, I shall endeavour so to unveil this Mystery, and put the Contro&rehy;versy between us in such a Light, as that every Reader of ordinary Sense and Reflection may be a competent Judge thereof.</P>
<P><LABEL>II.</LABEL> "YOU express an extreme Surprize and Concern, that I should take so much Pains to depreciate one of the no&rehy;blest Sciences, to disparage and traduce a Set of learned Men, whose Labours so greatly conduce to the Honour of this Island, (<IT>p.</IT> 5.) to lessen the Repu&rehy;tation and Authority of Sir <IT>Isaac New&rehy;ton</IT> and his Followers, by shewing that they are not such Masters of Reason as they are generally presumed to be; and to depreciate the Science they profess, by demonstrating to the World, that it <PB
N="5">
is not of that Clearness and Certainty as is commonly imagined. All which, you insist, appears very strange to you and the rest of that famous University, who plainly see of how great Use Mathema&rehy;tical Learning is to Mankind." Hence you take occasion to declaim on the Usefulness of Mathematics in the several Branches, and then to redouble your Sur&rehy;prize and Amazement (<IT>p.</IT> 19. and 20.). To all which Declamation I reply, that it is quite beside the Purpose. For I allow, and always have allowed, its full claim of Merit to whatever is useful and true in the Mathematics: But that which is not so, the less it employs Men's time and thoughts, the better. And after all you have said or can say, I believe the unpreju&rehy;diced Reader will think with me, that things obscure are not therefore sacred; and that it is no more a Crime to canvass and de&rehy;tect unsound Principles or false Reasonings in Mathematics, than in any other Part of Learning.</P>
<P><LABEL>III.</LABEL> YOU are, it seems, much at a loss to understand the Usefulness or Tendency or Prudence of my Attempt. I thought I had sufficiently explained this in the <IT>Ana&rehy;lyst</IT>. But for your further Satisfaction shall here tell you, it is very well known, that <PB
N="6">
several Persons who deride Faith and Mys&rehy;teries in Religion, admit the Doctrine of Fluxions for true and certain. Now if it be shewn that Fluxions are really most incom&rehy;prehensible Mysteries, and that those, who believe them to be clear and scientific, do entertain an implicite Faith in the Author of that Method; will not this furnish a fair <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Argumentum ad Hominem</FOREIGN> against Men, who reject that very thing in Religion which they admit in human Learning? And is it not a proper Way to abate the Pride, and discredit the Pretensions of those, who insist upon clear Ideas in Points of Faith, if it be shewn that they do without them even in Science?</P>
<P><LABEL>IV.</LABEL> AS to my timeing this Charge; why now and not before, since I had published Hints thereof many Years ago? Surely I am obliged to give no Account of this: If what hath been said in the Analyst be not sufficient; suppose that I had not Leisure, or that I did not think it expedient, or that I had no Mind to it. When a Man thinks fit to publish any Thing, either in Mathe&rehy;matics, or in any other Part of Learning; what avails it, or indeed what Right hath any one to ask, why at this or that Time; in this or that Manner; upon this or that Motive? Let the Reader judge, if it suffice <PB
N="7">
not, that what I publish is true, and that I have a Right to publish such Truths, when and how I please, in a free Country.</P>
<P><LABEL>V.</LABEL> I DO not say, that Mathematicians, as such, are Infidels; or that Geometry is a Friend to Infidelity; which you untruly insinuate, as you do many other Things; whence you raise Topics for invective: But I say there are certain Mathematicians, who are known to be so; and that there are o&rehy;thers, who are not Mathematicians, who are influenced by a Regard for their Au&rehy;thority. Some, perhaps, who live in the University, may not be apprised of this; but the intelligent and observing Reader, who lives in the World, and is acquainted with the Humour of the Times, and the Characters of Men, is well aware, there are too many that deride Mysteries, and yet admire Fluxions; who yield that Faith to a mere Mortal, which they deny to <IT>Jesus Christ</IT>, whose Religion they make it their Study and Business to discredit. The owning this is not to own, that Men who reason well, are Enemies to Religion, as you would represent it: On the contrary, I en&rehy;deavour to shew, that such Men are defec&rehy;tive in Point of Reason and Judgment, and that they do the very Thing they would seem to despise.</P>
<PB N="8">
<P><LABEL>VI.</LABEL> THERE are, I make no doubt, among the Mathematicians many sincere Believers in <IT>Jesus Christ</IT>; I know several such my self; but I addressed my Analyst to an Infidel; and on very good Grounds, I supposed that besides him, there were other Deriders of Faith, who had never&rehy;theless a profound Veneration for Fluxions; and I was willing to set forth the Incon&rehy;sistence of such Men. If there be no such Thing as Infidels, who pretend to Knowledge in the modern Analysis, I own my self misin&rehy;formed, and shall gladly be found in a Mistake; but even in that Case, my Remarks upon Fluxions are not the less true; nor will it follow, that I have no Right to exa&rehy;mine them on the Foot of humane Science, even though Religion were quite unconcerned, and though I had no End to serve but Truth. But you are very angry (<IT>P.</IT> 13 <IT>and</IT> 14.) that I should enter the Lists with reasoning Infidels, and attack them upon their Pretensions to Science: And hence you take Occasion to shew your Spleen a&rehy;gainst the Clergy. I will not take upon me to say, that I know you to be a Minute Philosopher your self: But I know, the Minute Philosophers make just such Com&rehy;pliments as you do to our Church, and are just as angry, as you can be, at any who un&rehy;dertake to defend Religion by Reason. If <PB
N="9">
we resolve all into Faith, they laugh at us and our Faith: And if we attempt to Rea&rehy;son, they are angry at us: They pretend we go out of our Province, and they re&rehy;commend to us a blind implicite Faith. Such is the Inconsistence of our Adversaries. But it is to be hoped, there will never be wanting Men to deal with them at their own Weapons; and to shew, they are by no Means those Masters of Reason, which they would fain pass for.
</P><P><LABEL>VII.</LABEL> I DO not say, as you would repre&rehy;sent me, that we have no better Reason for our Religion, than you have for Fluxions: But I say, that an Infidel, who believes the Doctrine of Fluxions, acts a very incon&rehy;sistent Part, in pretending to reject the Christian Religion, because he cannot be&rehy;lieve what he doth not comprehend; or because he cannot assent without Evidence; or because he cannot submit his Faith to Authority. Whether there are such Infidels, I submit to the Judgment of the Reader. For my own Part I make no Doubt of it, having seen some shrewd Signs thereof my self, and having been very credibly informed thereof by others. Nor doth this Charge seem the less credible, for your being so sen&rehy;sibly touched, and denying it with so much Passion. You, indeed, do not stick to affirm, <PB
N="10">
that the persons, who informed me are <q rend=it>a pack of base, profligate, and impudent liars</q>, (<IT>P.</IT> 27.) How far the Reader will think fit to adopt your passions, I cannot say; but I can truly say, the late celebrated Mr. <IT>Ad&rehy;dison</IT> is one of the persons, whom you are pleased to characterize in those modest and mannerly terms. He assured me that the In&rehy;fidelity of a certain noted Mathematician, still living, was one principal reason assign&rehy;ed by a witty man of those times for his being an Infidel. Not, that I imagine Geo&rehy;metry disposeth Men to Infidelity; but that from other causes, such as Presumption, Ig&rehy;norance, or Vanity, like other Men, Geo&rehy;metricians also become Infidels, and that the supposed light and evidence of their Science gains credit to their Infidelity.</P>
<P><LABEL>VIII.</LABEL> "YOU reproach me with Ca&rehy;lumny, detraction and artifice (<IT>P.</IT> 15.) You recommend such means as are in&rehy;nocent and just, rather than the crimi&rehy;nal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents (<IT>ibid</IT>.) You accuse me of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Odium Theologicum</FOREIGN>, the in&rehy;temperate Zeal of Divines, that I do <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">stare super vias antiquas</FOREIGN></IT>," (<IT>P.</IT> 13) with much more to the same effect. For all which charge I depend on the reader's candour, that he will not take your word, <PB
N="11">
but read and judge for himself. In which case he will be able to discern (though he should be no Mathematician) how passio&rehy;nate and unjust your reproaches are, and how possible it is for a Man to cry out against Calumny and practise it in the same breath. Considering how impatient all Mankind are when their prejudices are looked into, I do not wonder to see you rail and rage at the rate you do. But if your own Imagination be strongly shocked and moved, you cannot therefore conclude, that a sincere endeavour to free a science, so useful and ornamental to Humane Life, from those subtilties, obscurities, and para&rehy;doxes, which render it inaccessible to most Men, will be thought a criminal under&rehy;taking by such as are in their right Mind. Much less can you hope that an illustrious seminary of Learned Men, which hath produced so many free-spirited inquirers af&rehy;ter Truth, will at once enter into your pas&rehy;sions, and degenerate into a nest of Bigots.</P>
<P><LABEL>IX.</LABEL> I OBSERVE upon the Incon&rehy;sistency of certain Infidel Analysts. I re&rehy;mark some defects in the principles of the modern Analysis. I take the liberty de&rehy;cently to dissent from Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>. I propose some helps to abridge the trouble of Mathematical Studies, and render them <PB
N="12"> more useful. What is there in all this, that should make you declaim on the use&rehy;fulness of practical Mathematics? that should move you to cry out <IT>Spain, Inqui&rehy;sition,</IT> <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Odium Theologicum</FOREIGN>? By what figure of Speech, do you extend, what is said of the modern Analysis, to Mathematics in general, or what is said of Mathematical Infidels to all Mathematicians, or the con&rehy;futing an errour in Science to burning or hanging the Authors? But it is nothing new or strange, that Men should choose to indulge their passions, rather than quit their opinions how absurd soever. Hence the frightful visions and tragical uproars of Bigotted Men, be the Subject of their Bi&rehy;gotry what it will. A very remarkable in&rehy;stance of this you give (<IT>P.</IT> 27.) where, upon my having said that a deference to certain Mathematical Infidels, as I was credibly informed, had been one motive to Infidelity, you ask with no small emotion, <Q>"For God's sake are we in <IT>England</IT> or in <IT>Spain</IT>? Is this the language of a Fami&rehy;liar who is whispering an Inquisitor, <IT>&amp;c.</IT>"</Q> And, the page before, you exclaim in the following Words; <Q>"Let us burn or hang up all the Mathematicians in <IT>Great Britain</IT>, or halloo the mob upon them to tear them to pieces every Mother's Son of them, <FOREIGN
REND="it">Tros Rutulusve fuat</FOREIGN>, Laymen <PB N="13">
or Clergymen, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> Let us dig up the bodies of Dr. <IT>Barrow</IT> and Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>, and burn them under the Gal&rehy;lows.</Q></P>
<P><LABEL>X.</LABEL> THE Reader need not be a Ma&rehy;thematician, to see how vain all this Tra&rehy;gedy of yours is. And if he be as tho&rehy;roughly satisfied as I am, that the cause of Fluxions cannot be defended by rea&rehy;son, he will be as little surprised as I am, to see you betake your self to the arts of all bigotted men, raising terror, and cal&rehy;ling in the passions to your assistance. Whether those Rhetorical flourishes about the Inquisition and the Gallows are not quite ridiculous, I leave to be determined by the Reader. Who will also judge (though he should not be skilled in Geo&rehy;metry) whether I have given the least grounds for this and a World of such like declamation? and whether I have not constantly treated those celebrated Wri&rehy;ters, with all proper respect, though I take the liberty in certain points to differ from them?</P>
<P><LABEL>XI.</LABEL> AS I heartily abhor an Inquisition in Faith, so I think you have no right to erect one in Science. At the time of wri&rehy;ting your defence, you seem to have been <PB
N="14">
overcome with Passion: But now you may be supposed cool, I desire you to re&rehy;flect whether it be not wrote in the true spirit of an Inquisitor? Whether this be&rehy;comes a Person so exceeding delicate him&rehy;self upon that Point? And whether your Brethren the <IT>Analysts</IT> will think them&rehy;selves honoured or obliged by you, for having defended their Doctrine, in the same manner as any declaiming Bigot would defend Transubstantiation? The same false colours, the same intemperate Sallies, and the same Indignation against common Sense!</P>
<P><LABEL>XII.</LABEL> IN a matter of mere Science, where authority hath nothing to do, you constantly endeavour to overbear me with authorities, and load me with envy. If I see a Sophism in the writings of a great Author, and, in compliment to his un&rehy;derstanding, suspect he could hardly be quite satisfy'd with his own demonstra&rehy;tion: This sets you on declaiming for several pages. It is pompously set forth, as a criminal method of detracting from great men, as a concerted project to lessen their reputation, as making them pass for impostors. If I publish my free thoughts, which I have as much right to publish as any other man, it is imputed to rash<PB
N="15">
ness and vanity and the love of opposition. Though perhaps my late publication, of what had been hinted twenty five years ago, may acquit me of this charge in the eyes of an impartial Reader. But when I consider the perplexities that beset a man, who undertakes to defend the doctrine of Fluxions, I can easily forgive your anger.</P>
<P><LABEL>XIII.</LABEL> TWO sorts of learned men there are; one, who candidly seek Truth by rational means. These are never averse to have their principles looked into, and examined by the test of Reason. Ano&rehy;ther sort there is, who learn by <IT>route</IT> a set of principles and a way of thinking which happen to be in vogue. These betray themselves by their anger and sur&rehy;prise, whenever their principles are freely canvassed. But you must not expect, that your Reader will make himself a party to your passions or your prejudices. I freely own that Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> hath shew'd himself an extraordinary Mathematician, a profound Naturalist, a Person of the greatest Abilities and Erudition. Thus far I can readily go, but I cannot go the lengths that you do. I shall never say of him as you do, <Q><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vestigia pronus adoro</FOREIGN></Q>, (<IT>p.</IT> 70.) This same adoration that you pay to him, I will pay only to Truth.</P>
<PB N="16">
<P><LABEL>XIV.</LABEL> YOU may, indeed, your self be an Idolator of whom you please: But then you have no right to insult and ex&rehy;claim at other men, because they do not adore your Idol. Great as Sir <IT>Isaac New&rehy;ton</IT> was, I think he hath, on more occa&rehy;sions than one, shew'd himself not to be infallible. Particularly, his demonstration of the Doctrine of Fluxions I take to be defective, and I cannot help thinking that he was not quite pleased with it himself. And yet this doth not hinder but the me&rehy;thod may be useful, considered as an art of Invention. You, who are a Mathema&rehy;tician, must acknowledge, there have been divers such methods admitted in Mathe&rehy;matics, which are not demonstrative. Such, for instance, are the Inductions of Doctor <IT>Wallis</IT> in his Arithmetic of Infinites, and such, what <IT>Harriot</IT> and, after him, <IT>Des&rehy;cartes</IT> have wrote concerning the roots of affected &AElig;quations. It will not, neverthe&rehy;less, thence follow that those methods are useless; but only, that they are not to be allowed of as Premisses in a strict Demonstration.
</P><P><LABEL>XV.</LABEL> NO great Name upon earth shall ever make me accept things obscure for clear, or Sophisms for Demonstrations. Nor may you ever hope to deter me from freely speaking what I freely think, by <PB
N="17">
those arguments <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">ab invidia</FOREIGN> which at every turn you employ against me. You re&rehy;present your self (<IT>P.</IT> 52.) as a man, <q rend=it>whose highest Ambition is in the lowest degree to imitate Sir <ro>Isaac Newton.</ro></Q>. It might, per&rehy;haps, have suited better with your appel&rehy;lation of <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="ROGK">Philalethes</FOREIGN></IT>, and been altogether as laudable, if your highest ambition had been to discover Truth. Very consistently with the character you give of your self, you speak of it as a sort of crime (<IT>P.</IT> 70.) to think it possible, you should ever <IT>see further, or go beyond Sir</IT> Isaac Newton. And I am persuaded you speak the Senti&rehy;ments of many more besides your self. But there are others who are not afraid to sift the Principles of human Science, who think it no honour to imitate the greatest man in his Defects, who even think it no crime to desire to know, not only beyond Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>, but beyond all Mankind. And whoever thinks otherwise, I appeal to the Reader, whether he can properly be called a Philosopher.</P>
<P><LABEL>XVI.</LABEL> BECAUSE I am not guilty of your mean Idolatry, you inveigh against me as a person conceited of my own Abi&rehy;lities; not considering that a person of less Abilities may know more on a certain point than one of greater; not consider&rehy;ing that a purblind eye, in a close and <PB
N="18">
narrow view, may discern more of a thing, than a much better eye in a more exten&rehy;sive prospect; not considering that this is to fix a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ne plus ultra</FOREIGN>, to put a stop to all future inquiries; Lastly, not considering that this is in fact, so much as in you lies, converting the Republick of Letters into an absolute Monarchy, that it is even in&rehy;troducing a kind of Philosophic Popery among a free People.</P>
<P><LABEL>XVII.</LABEL> I HAVE said (and I venture still to say) that a Fluxion is incomprehensible: That second, third, and fourth Fluxions are yet more incomprehensible: That it is not possible to conceive a simple Infinitesimal, that it is yet less possible to conceive an In&rehy;finitesimal of an Infinitesimal, and so on&rehy;ward. <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>Analyst</IT>, Sect. 4. 5,6,<IT>&amp;c.</IT></NOTE> What have you to say in answer to this? Do you attempt to clear up the noti&rehy;on of a Fluxion or a Difference? Nothing like it; "you only assure me (upon your bare word) from your own experience, and that of several others whom you could name, that the Doctrine of Fluxions may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended; and that if I am puz&rehy;zled about it and do not understand it, yet others do". But can you think, Sir, I shall take your word when I refuse to take your Master's?</P>
<PB N="19">
<P><LABEL>XVIII.</LABEL> UPON this point every Rea&rehy;der of common sense may judge as well as the most profound Mathematician. The simple apprehension of a thing defined is not made more perfect by any subsequent progress in Mathematics. What any man evidently knows, he knows as well as you or Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>. And every one can know whether the object of this method be (as you would have us think) clearly conceivable. To judge of this, no depth of Science is requisite, but only a bare at&rehy;tention to what passes in his own mind. And the same is to be understood of all definitions in all Sciences whatsoever. In none of which can be supposed, that a man of Sense and Spirit will take any definition or principle upon trust, with&rehy;out sifting it to the bottom, and trying how far he can or he cannot conceive it. This is the course I have taken and shall take, however you and your Brethren may declaim against it, and place it in the most invidious Light.
</P><P><LABEL>XIX.</LABEL> IT is usual with you to admo&rehy;nish me to look over a second time, to consult, examine, weigh the words of Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>. In answer to which I will ven&rehy;ture to say, that I have taken as much pains as (I sincerely believe) any man <PB
N="20">
living, to understand that great Author, and to make sense of his principles. No industry nor caution nor attention, I assure you, have been wanting on my part. So that, if I do not understand him, it is not my fault but my misfortune. Upon other subjects you are pleased to compliment me with depth of thought and uncommon abilities, (<IT>P.</IT> 5. and 84.) But I freely own, I have no pretence to those things. The only advantage I pretend to, is that I have always thought and judged for my self. And, as I never had a master in Mathe&rehy;matics, so I fairly followed the dictates of my own mind in examining, and censu&rehy;ring the authors I read upon that subject, with the same freedom that I used upon any other; taking nothing upon trust, and believing that no writer was infallible. And a man of moderate parts, who takes this painful course in studying the prin&rehy;ciples of any Science, may be supposed to walk more surely than those of greater abilities, who set out with more speed and less care.</P>
<P><LABEL>XX.</LABEL> WHAT I insist on is, that the idea of a Fluxion, simply considered, is not at all improved or amended by any progress, though ever so great, in the Ana&rehy;lysis: neither are the demonstrations of the <PB
N="21">
general rules of that method at all cleared up by applying them. The reason of which is, because in operating or calculat&rehy;ing, men do not return to contemplate the original principles of the method, which they constantly presuppose, but are em&rehy;ployed in working, by notes and symbols, denoting the Fluxions supposed to have been at first explained, and according to rules supposed to have been at first de&rehy;monstrated. This I say to encourage those, who are not far gone in these Studies, to use intrepidly their own judg&rehy;ment, without a blind or a mean de&rehy;ference to the best of Mathematicians, who are no more qualify'd than they are, to judge of the simple apprehension, or the evidence of what is delivered in the first elements of the method; men by further and frequent use or exercise becoming only more accustomed to the symbols and rules, which doth not make either the foregoing notions more clear, or the foregoing proofs more perfect. Every Reader of common sense, that will but use his faculties, knows as well as the most profound Analyst what idea he frames or can frame of Velocity without motion, or of motion without ex&rehy;tension, of magnitude which is neither fi&rehy;nite nor infinite, or of a quantity having no magnitude which is yet divisible, of a figure where there is no space, of pro<PB
N="22">
portion between nothings, or of a real product from nothing multiplied by something. He need not be far gone in Geometry to know, that obscure principles are not to be ad&rehy;mitted in Demonstration: That if a man destroys his own Hypothesis, he at the same time destroys what was built upon it: That error in the premises, not rectified, must produce error in the conclusion.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXI.</LABEL> IN my opinion the greatest men have their Prejudices. Men learn the ele&rehy;ments of Science from others: And every learner hath a deference more or less to authority, especially the young learners, few of that kind caring to dwell long up&rehy;on principles, but inclining rather to take them upon trust: And things early admit&rehy;ted by repetition become familiar: And this familiarity at length passeth for Evi&rehy;dence. Now to me it seems, there are certain points tacitly admitted by Mathe&rehy;maticians, which are neither evident nor true. And such points or principles ever mixing with their reasoning do lead them into paradoxes and perplexities. If the great author of the fluxionary method was early imbued with such notions, it would only shew he was a man. And if by vir&rehy;tue of some latent error in his principles a man be drawn into fallacious reasonings, it is nothing strange that he should take <PB
N="23">
them for true: And, nevertheless, if, when urged by perplexities and uncouth conse&rehy;quences, and driven to arts and shifts, he should entertain some doubt thereof, it is no more than, one may naturally suppose, might befall a great genius grappling with an insuperable difficulty: Which is the light in which I have placed Sir <IT>Isaac New&rehy;ton</IT> <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>Analyst</IT>, Sect. xviij</NOTE>. Hereupon you are pleased to re&rehy;mark, that I represent the great author not only as a weak but an ill man, as a Deceiver and an Impostor. The Reader will judge how justly.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXII.</LABEL> AS to the rest of your colourings and glosses, your reproaches and insults and outcries, I shall pass them over, on&rehy;ly desiring the Reader not to take your word, but read what I have written, and he will want no other answer. It hath been often observed that the worst cause produceth the greatest clamour, and indeed you are so clamorous throughout your defence that the Reader, although he should be no Mathematician, provided he understands common sense and hath observed the ways of men, will be apt to suspect you are in the wrong. It should seem, therefore, that your Brethren the Analysts are but little obliged to you, for <PB
N="24">
this new method of declaiming in Mathe&rehy;matics. Whether they are more obliged by your Reasoning I shall now examine.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXIII.</LABEL> YOU ask me (<IT>p.</IT> 32.) where I find Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> using such expressions as the Velocities of Velocities, the second, third, and fourth Velocities, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> This you set forth as a pious fraud and unfair repre&rehy;sentation. I answer, that if according to Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> a Fluxion be the veloci&rehy;ty of an increment, then according to him I may call the Fluxion of a Fluxion the Ve&rehy;locity of a Velocity. But for the truth of the antecedent see his introduction to the Qua&rehy;drature of Curves, where his own words are, <Q><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">motuum velincrementorum velocitates nominando Fluxiones</FOREIGN></Q>. See also the second Lemma of the second Book of his mathematical principles of natural Philosophy, where he expresseth himself in the following manner, <q rend=it><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">velocitates incrementorum ac decrementorum, quas etiam, motus, mutationes & fluxiones quantitatum nominare licet</FOREIGN></q>. And that he ad&rehy;mits Fluxions of Fluxions, or second, third, fourth Fluxions, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> see his Treatise of the Quadrature of the Curves. I ask now, Is it not plain, that if a Fluxion be a Velocity, then the Fluxion of a Fluxion may agreea&rehy;bly thereunto be called the Velocity of a Velocity? In like manner if by a Fluxion <PB
N="25">
is meant a nascent augment, will it not then follow, that the Fluxion of a Fluxion, or second Fluxion is the nascent augment of a nascent augment? Can any thing be plain&rehy;er? Let the Reader now judge who is unfair.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXIV.</LABEL> I HAD observed, that the Great Author had proceeded illegitimately, in ob&rehy;taining the Fluxion or moment of the Rec&rehy;tangle of two flowing quantities; and that he did not fairly get rid of the Rectangle of the moments. In answer to this you al&rehy;ledge, that the error arising from the o&rehy;mission of such rectangle (allowing it to be an error) is so small that it is insignificant. This you dwell upon and examplify to no other purpose, but to amuse your Reader and mislead him from the Question; which in truth is not concerning the accuracy of computing or measuring in practice, but concerning the accuracy of the reasoning in science. That this was really the case, and that the smallness of the practical error no wise concerns it, must be so plain to any one who reads the Analyst, that I won&rehy;der how you could be ignorant of it.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXV.</LABEL> YOU would fain persuade your Reader, that I make an absurd quarrel a&rehy;gainst errors of no significancy in practice, and represent Mathematicians as proceeding <PB
N="26">
blindfold in their approximations; in all which I cannot help thinking there is on your part either great ignorance or great disingenuity. If you mean to defend the reasonableness and use of approximations, or of the method of Indivisibles, I have nothing to say. But then you must remem&rehy;ber this is not the Doctrine of Fluxions: It is none of that Analysis with which I am concerned. That I am far from quar&rehy;relling at approximations in Geometry is manifest from the thirty third and fifty third Queries in the Analyst. And that the method of Fluxions pretends to some&rehy;what more than the method of Indivisibles is plain; because Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> disclaims this method as not Geometrical. <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>See the Scholium at the end of the first Section</IT>, Lib. 1. Phil. Nat. Princip.

REND="it" LANG="LAT">In rebus mathematicis errores quam minimi non sunt contemnendi</FOREIGN>.</Q> Which ex&rehy;pression you have seen quoted in the Ana&rehy;lyst, and yet you seem ignorant thereof, and indeed, of the very End and Design of the Great Author in this his invention of Fluxions.</P>
<PB N="27">
<P><LABEL>XXVI.</LABEL> AS oft as you talk of finite quan&rehy;tities inconsiderable in practice, Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> disowns your apology. <Q><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Cave</FOREIGN></Q>, saith he, <q rend=it><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">in&rehy;tellexeris finitas</FOREIGN></q>. And although Quantities less than sensible may be of no account in practice, yet none of your masters, nor will even you yourself venture to say, they are of no account in Theory and in Reasoning. The application in gross practice is not the point questioned, but the rigour and just&rehy;ness of the reasoning. And it is evident that, be the subject ever so little, or ever so inconsiderable, this doth not hinder but that a person treating thereof may com&rehy;mit very great errors in Logic, which Lo&rehy;gical errors are in no wise to be measured by the sensible or practical inconveniences thence arising, which, perchance, may be none at all. It must be owned, that after you have mislead and amused your less qua&rehy;lified Reader (as you call him) you return to the real point in controversy, and set your self to justifie Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s method of getting rid of the abovementioned Rectan&rehy;gle. And here I must intreat the Reader to observe how fairly you proceed.
</P><P><LABEL>XXVII.</LABEL> FIRST then you affirm (<IT>P.</IT> 44.) <Q>"that, neither in the Demonstration of the Rule for finding the Fluxion of the rec&rehy;tangle of two flowing quantities, nor in <PB
N="28">
any thing preceding or following it, is any mention so much as once made of the increment of the rectangle of such flowing quantities."</Q> Now I affirm the direct contrary. For in the very passage by you quoted in this same page, from the first case of the second lemma of the second Book of Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s Principles, beginning with <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo auctum</Q>, and ending with <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">igitur laterum in&rehy;crementis totis a et b generatur rectanguli incrementum 
a B x b A Q. E. D.</Q>. In this very passage, I say, is express mention made of the increment of such rectangle. As this is matter of fact, I refer it to the Reader's own eyes. Of what rectangle have we here the Increment? Is it not plainly of that whose sides have <IT>a</IT> and <IT>b</IT> for their <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Incre&rehy;menta tota</FOREIGN>, that is of <IT>AB</IT>? Let any Reader judge whether it be not plain from the words, the sense, and the context, that the Great Author in the end of his demonstra&rehy;tion understands his <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">incrementum</FOREIGN> as belong&rehy;ing to the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Rectangulum quodvis</FOREIGN></IT> at the begin&rehy;ning. Is not the same also evident from the very Lemma it self prefixed to the Demon&rehy;stration? The sense whereof is (as the Au&rehy;thor there explains it) that if the moments of the flowing quantities <IT>A</IT> and <IT>B</IT> are cal&rehy;led <IT>a</IT> and <IT>b</IT>, then the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">momentum vel mutatio geniti rectanguli</FOREIGN> AB</IT> will be <IT>aB x bA</IT>. <PB
N="29">
Either therefore the conclusion of the de&rehy;monstration is not the thing which was to be demonstrated, or the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">rectanguli incremen&rehy;tum</FOREIGN> <GAP DESC="formula"><!-- a B x b A</formula>--></IT> belongs to the rectangle AB.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXVIII.</LABEL> ALL this is so plain that no&rehy;thing can be more so; and yet you would fain perplex this case by distinguish&rehy;ing between an increment and a moment. But it is evident to every one, who has any notion of Demonstration, that the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">incre&rehy;mentum</FOREIGN> in the Conclusion must be the <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">mo&rehy;mentum</FOREIGN></IT> in the Lemma; and to suppose it otherwise is no credit to the Author. It is in effect supposing him to be one who did not know what he would demonstrate. But let us hear Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s own words: <q rend=it><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Earum (quantitatum scilicet fluentium) incrementa vel decrementa momentanea sub nomine mo&rehy;mentorum intelligo</FOREIGN></q>. And you observe your self that he useth the word <IT>moment</IT> to sig&rehy;nify either an increment or decrement. Hence, with an intention to puzzle me, you propose the increment and decrement of <IT>AB</IT>, and ask which of these I would call the moment? The case, you say, is difficult. My answer is very plain and easy, to wit, Either of them. You, indeed, make a different answer, and from the Author's saying that, by a moment he understands either the mo&rehy;mentaneous increment or decrement of the <PB
N="30">
flowing quantities, you would have us con&rehy;clude, by a very wonderful inference, that his moment is neither the increment nor decrement thereof. Would it not be as good an inference, Because a number is either odd or even, to conclude it is neither? Can any one make sense of this? Or can even your self hope that this will go down with the Reader, how little soever qualified? It must be owned, you endeavour to obtrude this inference on him, rather by mirth and humour than by reasoning. You are merry, I say, and (<IT>P.</IT> 46.) represent the two ma&rehy;thematical quantities as pleading their rights, as tossing up cross and pile, as dis&rehy;puting amicably. You talk of their claim&rehy;ing preference, their agreeing, their boy&rehy;ishness and their gravity. And after this in&rehy;genious disgression you address me in the fol&rehy;lowing words. &horfill; <Q>Believe me there is no re&rehy;medy, you must acquiesce.</Q> But my answer is, that I will neither believe you nor ac&rehy;quiesce; there is plain remedy in common sense; and, to prevent surprise, I desire the Reader always to keep the controverted point in view, to examine your reasons, and be cautious how he takes your word, but most of all when you are positive or eloquent or merry.</P>
<PB N="31">
<P><LABEL>XXIX.</LABEL> A PAGE or two after, you very candidly represent your case to be that of an Ass between two bottles of hay; it is your own expression. The cause of your perplexity is, that you know not whether the velocity of <IT>AB</IT> increasing or of <IT>AB</IT> decreasing is to esteemed the Fluxion, or proportional to the moment of the rec&rehy;tangle. My opinion, agreeably to what hath been premised, is that either may be deemed the Fluxion. But you tell us (<IT>P.</IT> 49.) "that you think, the venerable ghost of Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> whispers you, The Velocity you seek for is neither the one nor the other of these, but is the ve&rehy;locity which the flowing rectangle hath, not while it is greater or less than <IT>AB</IT>, but at that very instant of time that it is <IT>AB</IT>." For my part, in the rectangle <IT>AB</IT> considered simply in it self, without either increasing or diminishing, I can con&rehy;ceive no velocity at all. And if the Reader is of my mind, he will not take either your word, or even the word of a Ghost, how venerable soever, for velocity without mo&rehy;tion. You proceed and tell us that, in like manner, the moment of the rectangle is neither its increment nor decrement. This you would have us believe on the authority of his Ghost, in direct opposition to what Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> himself asserted when alive. <q rend=it><FOREIGN

</P><P><LABEL>XXX.</LABEL> TO me it verily seems, that you have undertaken the defence of what you do not understand. To mend the matter, you say, <Q>"you do not consider <IT>AB</IT> as ly&rehy;ing at either extremity of the mo&rehy;ment, but as extended to the middle of it; as having acquired the one half of the moment, and as being about to acquire the other; or, as having lost one half of it, and being about to lose the other."</Q> Now, in the name of Truth, I intreat you to tell what this moment is, to the middle whereof the rectangle is extended? This moment, I say, which is acquired, which is lost, which is cut in two, or distinguish&rehy;ed into halfs? Is it a finite quantity, or an infinitesimal, or a mere limit, or nothing at all? Take it in what sense you will, I cannot make your defence either consistent or intelligible. For if you take it in either of the two former senses, you contradict Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>. And if you take it in <PB
N="33">
either of the latter, you contradict common sense; it being plain, that what hath no magnitude, or is no quantity, cannot be divided. And here I must intreat the Rea&rehy;der to preserve his full freedom of mind intire, and not weakly suffer his judgment to be overborn by your imagination and your prejudices, by great names and au&rehy;thorities, by Ghosts and Visions, and a&rehy;bove all by that extreme satisfaction and complacency with which you utter your strange conceits; if words without a mean&rehy;ing may be called so. After having given this unintelligible account, you ask with your accustomed air, <Q>"What say you, Sir? Is this a just and legitimate reason for Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s proceeding as he did? I think you must acknowledge it to be so."</Q> But alas! I acknowledge no such thing. I find no sense or reason in what you say. Let the Reader find it if he can.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXI.</LABEL> IN the next Place (<IT>P.</IT> 50.) you charge me with want of caution. <Q>"Inas&rehy;much (say you) as that quantity which Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> through his whole Lemma, and all the several Cases of it, constantly calls a <IT>Moment</IT>, without con&rehy;fining it to be either an increment or decrement is by you inconsiderately and arbitrarily, and without any Shadow of <PB
N="34">
of <CORR SIC="Reasou">Reason</CORR> given, supposed and deter&rehy;mined to be an increment."</Q> To which Charge I reply that it is untrue as it is peremptory. For that, in the foregoing citation from the first case of Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s Lemma, he expresly determines it to be an Increment. And as this particular Instance of Passage was that which I objected to, it was reasonable and proper for me to consider the Moment in that same Light. But take it increment or decrement as you will, the Objections still lie, and the Difficulties are equally insuperable. You then pro&rehy;ceed to extoll the great Author of the fluxio&rehy;nary Method, and to bestow some <IT>Brus&rehy;queries</IT> upon those who unadvisedly dare to differ from him. To all which I shall give no answer.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXII.</LABEL> AFTERWARDS to re&rehy;move (as you say) all Scruple and Difficulty about this affair, you observe that the Mo&rehy;ment of the Rectangle determined by Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>, and the Increment of the Rectangle determined by me, are perfectly and exactly equal, supposing <IT>a</IT> and <IT>b</IT> to be diminished <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">ad infinitum</FOREIGN>: and for proof of this, you refer to the first Lemma of the first Section of the first Book of Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s Principles. I answer, that if <IT>a</IT> and <IT>b</IT> are real quantities, then <IT>ab</IT> is something, and <PB
N="35">
consequently makes a real difference: but if they are nothing, then the Rectangles whereof they are coefficients become nothing likewise: and consequently the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">momentum</FOREIGN> or <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">incrementum</FOREIGN></IT>, whether Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s or mine, are in that Case nothing at all. As for the abovementioned Lem&rehy;ma, which you refer to, and which you wish I had consulted sooner, both for my own sake and for yours; I tell you I had long since consulted and considered it. But I very much doubt whether you have suf&rehy;ficiently considered that Lemma, its De&rehy;monstration, and its Consequences. For, however that way of reasoning may do in the Method of <IT>exhaustions</IT>, where quanti&rehy;ties less than assignable are regarded as nothing; yet for a Fluxionist writing a&rehy;bout momentums, to argue that quantities must be equal because they have no assign&rehy;able difference, seems the most injudici&rehy;ous Step that could be taken: it is direct&rehy;ly demolishing the very Doctrine you would defend. For it will thence follow, that all homogeneous momentums are e&rehy;qual, and consequently the velocities, mutations, or fluxions proportional thereto, are all likewise equal. There is, therefore, only one proportion of equality through&rehy;out, which at once overthrows the whole System you undertake to defend. Your <PB
N="36">
moments (I say) not being themselves as&rehy;signable quantities, their differences cannot be assignable: and if this be true, by that way of reasoning it will follow, they are all equal, upon which Supposition you cannot make one Step in the Method of Fluxions. It appears from hence, how unjustly you blame me (<IT>P.</IT> 32.) for omitting to give any Account of that first Section of the first Book of the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Principia</FOREIGN>, wherein (you say) the Foundation of the Method of Fluxions is geometrically demonstrated and largely explained, and difficulties and ob&rehy;jections against it are clearly solved. All which is so far from being true, that the very first and fundamental Lemma of that Section is incompatible with, and subver&rehy;sive of the doctrine of Fluxions. And, indeed, who sees not that a Demonstra&rehy;tion <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">ad absurdum more veterum</FOREIGN></IT> proceeding on a Supposition, that every difference must be some given quantity, cannot be admitted in, or consist with, a method, wherein Quantities, less than any given, are supposed really to exist, and be capable of division?</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXIII.</LABEL> THE next point you under&rehy;take to defend is that method for obtain&rehy;ing a rule to find the Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity, which is delivered in the introduction to the Quadratures, <PB
N="37">
and considered in the Analyst. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 13,14, &amp;c.</NOTE> And here the question between us is, whether I have rightly represented the sense of those words, <Q><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">evanescant jam augmenta illa</FOREIGN></Q>, in rendering them, let the increments vanish, <IT>i.e.</IT> let the increments be nothing, or let there be no increments? This you deny, but, as your manner is, instead of giving a reason you declaim. I, on the contrary affirm, the increments must be understood to be quite gone and absolutely nothing at all. My reason is, because with&rehy;out that supposition you can never bring the quantity or expression <GAP DESC="formula"><!--nx \sup n-1 + {nn-n\over 2} ox \sup n-2 +</formula--> &amp;c. down to <GAP DESC="formula"><!--nx \sup n-1 </formula-->, the very thing aimed at by supposing the evanescence. Say whe&rehy;ther this be not the truth of the case? Whether the former expression is not to be reduced to the latter? And whether this can possibly be done so long as <IT>o</IT> is suppo&rehy;sed a real Quantity? I cannot indeed say you are scrupulous about your affirmati&rehy;ons, and yet I believe that even you will not affirm this; it being most evident, that the product of two real quantities is some&rehy;thing real; and that nothing real can be <PB
N="38">
rejected either according to the <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">akribeia</FOREIGN> of Geometry, or according to Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s own principles; for the truth of which I ap&rehy;peal to all who know any thing of these matters. Further by <IT>evanescent</IT> must either be meant, let them (the increments) vanish and become nothing, in the obvious sense, or else let them become infinitely small. But that this latter is not Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s sense is evident from his own words in the very same page, that is, in the last of the Introduction to his Quadratures, where he expressly saith <Q><FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">volui ostendere quod in me&rehy;thodo Fluxionum non opus sit figuras infinit&egrave; parvas in Geometriam introducere</FOREIGN>.</Q> Upon the whole, you seem to have considered this affair so very superficially, as greatly to confirm me in the opinion, you are so an&rehy;gry with, to wit, that Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s followers are much more eager in applying his me&rehy;thod, than accurate in examining his prin&rehy;ciples. You raise a dust about evanescent augments which may perhaps amuse and amaze your Reader, but I am much mis&rehy;taken if it ever instructs or enlightens him. For, to come to the point, those evanescent augments either are real quantities, or they are not. If you say they are; I desire to know, how you get rid of the rejectaneous quantity? If you say they are not; you instead get rid of those quantities in the com&rehy;position whereof they are coefficients; but <PB
N="39">
then you are of the same opinion with me, "which opinion you are pleased to call (<IT>P.</IT> 58.) a most palpable, inexcusable, and unpardonable blunder, although it be a Truth most palpably evident".</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXIV.</LABEL> NOTHING, I say, can be plainer to any impartial Reader, than that by the Evanescence of augments, in the above cited passage, Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> means their being actually reduced to nothing. But to put it out of all doubt, that this is the truth, and to convince even you, who shew so little disposition to be convinced, I de&rehy;sire you to look into his <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="lat">Analysis per &aelig;qua&rehy;tiones infinitas</FOREIGN> (<IT>P.</IT> 20.) where, in his pre&rehy;paration for demonstrating the first rule for the squaring of simple Curves, you will find that on a parallel occasion, speak&rehy;ing of an augment which is supposed to vanish, he interprets the word <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">evanescere</FOREIGN> by <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">esse nihil</FOREIGN>. Nothing can be plainer than this, which at once destroys your defence. And yet, plain as it is, I despair of making you acknowledge it; though I am sure you feel it, and the Reader if he useth his eyes must see it. The words <Q
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Evanescere sive esse nihil</Q> do (to use your own expression) <Q>stare us in the face</Q>. Lo! "This is what you call (<IT>P.</IT> 56.) so great, so unaccounta&rehy;ble, so horrid, so truly <IT>B&oelig;otian</IT> a blunder" <PB
N="40"> that, according to you, it was not possible Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> could be guilty of it. For the future, I advise you to be more sparing of hard words: Since, as you in&rehy;cautiously deal them about, they may chance to light on your friends as well as your adversaries. As for my part, I shall not retaliate. It is sufficient to say you are mistaken, But I can easily pardon your mistakes. Though, indeed, you tell me on this very occasion, that I must expect no quarter from Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s followers. And I tell you that I neither expect nor desire any. My aim is truth. My reasons I have given. Confute them, if you can. But think not to overbear me either with au&rehy;thorities or harsh words. The latter will recoil upon your selves: The former in a matter of science are of no weight with indifferent Readers; and as for Bigots, I am not concerned about what they say or think.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXV.</LABEL> IN the next place you pro&rehy;ceed to declaim upon the following pas&rehy;sage taken from the seventeenth section of the Analyst. <Q>"Considering the various arts and devices used by the great au&rehy;thor of the fluxionary method: In how many lights he placeth his Fluxions: and in what different ways he attempts to <PB

Would you like it better if I should say, the various <IT>incon&rehy;sistent</IT> accounts, which this great author gives of his momentums and his fluxions, may convince every intelligent Reader that he had no clear and steady notions of them, without which there can be no de&rehy;monstration?

</P><P><LABEL>XXXVI.</LABEL> YOU, Sir, with the bright eyes, be pleased to tell me, whether Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s momentum be a finite quantity, or an infinitesimal, or a mere limit? If you say, a finite quantity: Be pleased to recon&rehy;cile this with what he says in the Scho&rehy;lium of the second Lemma of the first Section of the first book of his Principles: <Q

deerant momentorum dimidia</Q>, &amp;c. where the moments are supposed to be divided. I should be very glad, a person of such lu&rehy;minous intellect would be so good as to explain, whether by Fluxions we are to understand the nascent or evanescent quan&rehy;tities themselves, or their motions, or their Velocities, or simply their proportions: and having interpreted them in what sense you will, that you would then conde&rehy;scend to explain the Doctrine of second, third, and fourth Fluxions, and shew it to be consistent with common sense if you can. You seem to be very sanguine when you express your self in the following terms. <Q>"I do assure you, Sir, from my own Experience, and that of many o&rehy;thers whom I could name, that the Doctrine may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended"</Q> (<IT>p.</IT> 31.)

that several will be obliged to you who, I may venture to say, understand those matters no more than my self. But, if I am not much mistaken, you and your friends will modestly decline this task.</P>
<P><LABEL>XXXVII.</LABEL> I HAVE long ago done what you so often exhort me to do, dili&rehy;gently read and considered the several ac&rehy;counts of this Doctrine given by the great Author in different parts of his writings: and upon the whole I could never make it out to be consistent and intelligible. I was even led to say, "that one would be in&rehy;clined to think , He was himself suspi&rehy;cious of the justness of his own demon&rehy;strations: and that he was not enough pleased with any one Notion steadily to adhere to it." After which I ad&rehy;ded, "Thus much is plain that he own&rehy;ed himself satisfied concerning certain points, which nevertheless he could not undertake to demonstrate to others." See the seventeenth section of the Analyst. It is one thing when a Doctrine is placed in various lights: and another, when the principles and notions are shifted.

In all which it appears to me, there is not one uniform doctrine explained and carried throughout the whole, but rather sundry inconsistent accounts of this new Method, which still grows more dark and confused the more it is handled: I could not help thinking, the greatest genius might lie under the influence of false principles; and where the object and notions were exceeding ob&rehy;scure, he might possibly distrust even his own demonstrations. "At least thus much seemed plain, that Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> had sometime owned himself satisfied, where he could not demonstrate to others. In proof whereof I mentioned his letter to Mr. <IT>Collins</IT>; Hereupon you tell me: there is a great deal of difference be&rehy;tween saying, I cannot undertake to prove a thing, and I will not under&rehy;take it." But in answer to this, I de&rehy;sire you will be pleased to consider, that I was not making a precise extract out of that letter, in which the very words of Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> should alone be inserted. But I made my own remark and inference, <PB

from what I remembred to have read in that letter; where, speaking of a certain Mathematical matter, Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> expresseth himself, in the following terms. <Q>"It is plain to me by the fountain I draw it from; though I will not undertake to prove it to others."</Q> Now whether my inference may not be fairly drawn from those words of Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT>; and whether the difference as to the sense be so great between <IT>will</IT> and <IT>can</IT> in that particular case, I leave to be determined by the Reader.</P>

After this you employ (<IT>P.</IT> 65) your usual colouring, and represent the great Author of the method of Fluxions <Q>"as a Good old Gentleman fast asleep, and snoring in his easy chair; while dame Fortune is bringing him her apron full of beautiful theorems and problems, which he never knows or thinks of."</Q> This you would have pass for a conse<PB

I further appeal to the conscience of all the most profound Mathematicians, whether they can, with perfect acquiescence of mind free from all scruple, apply any proposition merely upon the strength of a Demonstra&rehy;tion involving second or third Fluxions, without the aid of any such experiment or analogy or collateral proof whatsoever? Lastly, I appeal to the Reader's own heart, whether he cannot clearly conceive a me&rehy;dium between being fast asleep and demon&rehy;strating? But you will have it, that I re&rehy;present Sir <IT>Isaac</IT>'s Conclusions as com&rehy;ing out right, because one error is compen&rehy;sated by another contrary and equal error, which perhaps he never knew himself nor thought of: that by a twofold mistake he arrives though not at science yet at Truth: that he proceeds blindfold, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> All which is untruly said by you, who have misap&rehy;plied to Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> what was intended for the <FOREIGN

But you seem to have grown giddy with passion, and in the heat of controversy to have mistaken and forgot your part. I beseech you, Sir, to consider, that the Marquis (whom alone, and not Sir <IT>Isaac</IT> this double error in finding the subtangent doth concern) rejects indeed in&rehy;finitesimals, but not on the foot that you do, to wit, their being inconsiderable in practical Geometry or mixed Mathematics. But he rejects them in the accuracy of Spe&rehy;culative Knowledge: in which respect there may be great Logical errors, al&rehy;though there should be no sensible mistake in practice: which, it seems, is what you cannot comprehend. He rejects them like&rehy;wise in virtue of a Postulatum, which I venture to call rejecting them without ce&rehy;remony.

And how this comes about, I have at large explained in the Analyst, and shewed in that particular case of Tangents, that the Rejectaneous Quantity might have been a finite quanti&rehy;ty of any given magnitude, and yet the conclusion have come out exactly the same way; and consequently, that the truth of this method doth not depend on the reason assigned by the Marquis, to wit, the <FOREIGN

That I have often expressed my self to the same effect, desiring the Reader to remember, that I am only concerned about the way of coming at your theorems, whether it be legitimate or illegitimate, clear or obscure, scienti&rehy;fic or tentative: That I have on this ve&rehy;ry occasion, to prevent all possibility of mistake, repeated and insisted that I consider the Geometrical Analyst as a Logician, <IT>i.e.</IT> so far forth as he reasons and argues; and his mathematical con&rehy;clusions not in themselves but in their premises; not as true or false, useful or insignificant, but as derived from such principles, and by such inferences". <NOTE

It is very plain, if you are in earnest, that you neither understand me nor your Masters.

But though you are not afraid or ashamed to represent the Analysts as very clear and uni&rehy;form in their Conception of these matters, yet I do solemnly affirm (and several of themselves know it to be true) that I found no harmony or agreement among them, but the reverse thereof, the greatest disso&rehy;nance, and even contrariety of Opinions, employed to explain what after all seem&rehy;ed inexplicable.</P>

<P><LABEL>XLV.</LABEL> HAVING gone through your Defence of the British Mathematicians, I find in the next place, that you attack me on a point of Metaphysics, with what success the Reader will determine. I had upon another Occasion many years ago wrote against Abstract general Ideas. <NOTE

(<IT>P.</IT> 74.) This implies that I hold there are no general Ideas. But I hold the direct contrary, that there are indeed general Ideas, but not formed by abstraction in the man&rehy;ner set forth by Mr. <IT>Locke</IT>. To me it is plain, there is no consistent Idea, the likeness whereof may not really exist. Whatsoever therefore is said to be some&rehy;what which cannot exist, the Idea thereof must be inconsistent. Mr. <IT>Locke</IT> acknowledg&rehy;eth it doth require Pains and Skill to form his general Idea of a Triangle. He further expresly saith, it must be neither oblique nor rectangular, neither equilateral, equi&rehy;crural, nor scalenum; but all and none <PB

of these at once. He also saith, it is an Idea wherein some parts of several diffe&rehy;rent and inconsistent Ideas are put toge&rehy;ther. <NOTE
N="&dag;" PLACE="foot"><IT>Essay on Humane Understanding</IT>, b.iv. c.vii. &sect;. ix.</NOTE> All this looks very like a Con&rehy;tradiction.

<P><LABEL>XLVI.</LABEL> I DESIRE to know, whether it is not possible for any thing to exist, which doth not include a contradiction: And if it is, whether we may not infer, that what cannot possibly exist, the same doth include a contradiction: I further desire to know, whether the reader can frame a distinct idea of any thing that includes a contradiction? For my part, I cannot, nor consequently of the above&rehy;mentioned Triangle; Though you (who it seems know better than my self what I can do) are pleased to assure me of the contrary. Again, I ask whether that, which it is above the power of man to form a compleat idea of, may not be called incomprehensible? And whether the Reader can frame a compleat idea of this imperfect, impossible Triangle? And if not, whether it doth not follow that it <PB
N="58">
is incomprehensible? It should seem, that a distinct aggregate of a few consistent parts was nothing so difficult to conceive, or impossible to exist; and that, therefore your Comment must be wide of the Au&rehy;thor's meaning. You give me to under&rehy;stand (<IT>P.</IT> 82.) that this account of a ge&rehy;neral Triangle was a trap which Mr. <IT>Locke</IT> set to catch fools. Who is caught therein let the Reader judge.</P>
<P><LABEL>XLVII.</LABEL> IT is Mr. <IT>Locke</IT>'s opinion, that every general name stands for a ge&rehy;neral abstract idea, which prescinds from the species or individuals comprehended under it. Thus, for example, according to him, the general name <IT>Colour</IT> stands for an idea, which is neither Blue, Red, Green nor any other particular colour, but somewhat distinct and abstracted from them all. To me it seems, the word <IT>Colour</IT> is only a more general name applicable to all and each of the particular colours; while the other specific names, as Blue, Red, Green, and the like are each re&rehy;strained to a more limited signification. The same may be said of the word Tri&rehy;angle. Let the Reader judge whether this be not the case; and whether he can distinctly frame such an idea of colour as shall prescind from all the species there<PB

<P><LABEL>XLVIII.</LABEL> I intreat my Reader to think. For if he doth not, he may be under some influence from your confident and positive way of talking. But any one who thinks may, if I mistake not, plainly perceive that you are deluded, as it often happens, by mistaking the terms for ideas. Nothing is easier, than to define in terms or words that which is incomprehensible in idea, forasmuch as any words can be either se&rehy;parated or joined as you please, but ideas always cannot. It is as easy to say a round square as an oblong square, though the for&rehy;mer be inconceivable. If the Reader will but take a little care to distinguish between the Definition and the Idea, between words or expressions and the conceptions of the mind, he will judge of the truth of what I now advance, and clearly perceive how far you are mistaken, in attempting to illu&rehy;strate Mr. <IT>Locke</IT>'s Doctrine, and where your mistake lies. Or, if the Reader is minded to make short work, he needs only at once to try whether laying aside the words he can frame in his mind the idea of an impossi&rehy;ble triangle; upon which trial the issue of <PB
N="60">
this dispute may be fairly put. This do&rehy;ctrine of abstract general ideas seemed to me a capital error, productive of number&rehy;less difficulties and disputes, that runs not only throughout Mr. <IT>Locke</IT>'s book, but through most parts of Learning. Conse&rehy;quently, my animadversions thereupon were not an effect of being inclined to carp or cavil at a single passage, as you would wrongfully insinuate, but proceeded from a love of Truth and a desire to banish, so far as in me lay, false principles and wrong ways of thinking, without respect of per&rehy;sons. And indeed, though you and other Party-men are violently attached to your respective Masters, yet I, who profess my self only attached to Truth, see no reason why I may not as freely animadvert on Mr. <IT>Locke</IT> or <CORR

But I am comforted under the severity of your reprehensions, when I con&rehy;sider the weakness of your arguments, which, were they as strong as your reproofs, could leave no doubt in the mind of the Reader concerning the matters in dispute between us. As it is, I leave him to re&rehy;flect and examine by your light, how clear&rehy;ly he is enabled to conceive a fluxion, or the fluxion of a fluxion, a part infinitely small subdivided into an infinity of parts, a nascent or evanescent increment, that which is neither something nor nothing, a triangle formed in a point, velocity with&rehy;out motion, and the rest of those <FOREIGN

And yet he very modestly gives his Reader to understand, that he is able to clear up all difficulties and objections, that have ever been made (<IT>P.</IT> 5). Mr. <IT>Walton</IT> in <PB

the beginning, like <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="GKGK">Philalethes</FOREIGN>, from a par&rehy;ticular case makes a general inference, supposing that Infidelity to be imputed to Mathematicians in general, which I suppose only in the person to whom the Analyst was addressed, and certain other persons of the same mind with him: Whether this extraordinary way of reasoning be the cause or effect of his passion, I know not: But before I had got to the end of his Vindi&rehy;cation, I ceased to be surprized at his Lo&rehy;gic and his temper in the beginning. The double error, which in the Analyst was plainly meant to belong to others, he with <IT><FOREIGN

And this wri&rehy;ter also, as well as the <IT>Cantabrigian</IT>, must needs take upon him to explain the mo&rehy;tive of my writing against Fluxions: which he gives out, with great assurance, to have been, because Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> had presumed to interpose in Prophecies and Revelations, and to decide in religi&rehy;ous affairs (<IT>P.</IT> 4.) which is so far from be&rehy;ing true, that, on the contrary, I have a high value for those learned remains of that Great Man, whose original and free Genius is an eternal reproach to that tribe of followers, who are always imitating, but never resemble him. This specimen <PB

But if he can no more make sense of what this Gen&rehy;tleman has written than I can, he will need no answer to it.

This Vindicator, indeed, by his dissembling nine parts in ten of the difficulties proposed in the Analyst, shew&rehy;eth no inclination to be catechised by me. But his Scholars have a right to be in&rehy;formed. I, therefore, recommend it to them, not to be imposed on by hard words and magisterial assertions, but care&rehy;fully to pry into his sense, and sift his meaning, and particularly to insist on a distinct answer to the following questions.</P>
<P><LABEL>IV.</LABEL> LET them ask him, whether he can conceive velocity without motion, or motion without extension, or extension without magnitude? If he answers that he can, let him teach them to do the same. If he cannot, let him be asked, how he reconciles the idea of a Fluxion which he gives (<IT>P.</IT> 13.) with common sense? Again, let him be asked, whether nothing be not the product of nothing multiplied by something? And if so, when the difference between the Gnonom and the sum of the rectangles <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>See Vindication</IT>, p. 17.</NOTE> vanisheth, whether the rectangles themselves do not also vanish? <IT>i.e.</IT> when <IT>a b</IT> is nothing, whether <GAP DESC="formula"><!--it>Ab + Ba</it></formula--> be not also nothing? <PB N="70">
<IT>i.e.</IT> whether the momentum of <IT>AB</IT> be not nothing? Let him then be asked, what his momentums are good for, when they are thus brought to nothing? Again, I wish he were asked to explain the difference be&rehy;tween a magnitude infinitely small and a magnitude infinitely diminished. If he saith there is no difference: Then let him be further asked how he dares to explain the method of Fluxions by the <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ratio</FOREIGN> of mag&rehy;nitudes infinitely diminished (<IT>P.</IT> 9.) when Sir <IT>Isaac Newton</IT> hath expressly excluded all consideration of quantities infinitely small? <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="foot"><IT>See the Introduction to his Quadratures</IT>.</NOTE> If this able Vindicator should say that quantities infinitely diminished are nothing at all, and consequently that, ac&rehy;cording to him, the first and last <IT>Ratio</IT>'s are proportions between nothings, let him be desired to make sense of this, or explain what he means by <IT>proportion between no&rehy;things</IT>. If he should say the ultimate pro&rehy;portions are the <IT>Ratio</IT>'s of mere limits, then let him be asked how the limits of lines can be proportioned or divided? After all, who knows but this Gentleman, who hath already complained of me for an uncom&rehy;mon way of treating Mathematics and Ma&rehy;thematicians (<IT>P.</IT> 5.) may (as well as the <IT>Cantabrigian</IT>) cry out, <IT>Spain</IT> and the <IT>In&rehy;quisition</IT>, when he finds himself thus closely pursued and beset with Interrogatories? <PB

That we may not, therefore, seem too hard on an innocent man, who probably meant nothing, but was betray'd by following another into difficulties and straits that he was not aware of, I shall propose one single expedient, by which his Disciples (whom it most concerns) may soon satisfy them&rehy;selves, whether this Vindicator really un&rehy;derstands what he takes upon him to vin&rehy;dicate. It is in short, that they would ask him to explain the second, third or fourth Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this the Touchstone of his Vindication. If he can do it, I shall own my self much mistaken: If he cannot, it will be evident that he was much mistaken in himself, when he pre&rehy;sumed to defend Fluxions without so much as knowing what they are. So having put the merits of the cause on this issue, I leave him to be tried by his Scholars.</P>
