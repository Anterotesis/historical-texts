<P>&Tic;HE eternall Happinesse of our immortall souls is to be found only in union and communion with <IT>Iesus Christ; Religion</IT> is that which gathers and binds up the spirit to close fellowship with <IT>Him</IT>; This bond is twist&rehy;ed out of those materials, which the severall pen-men of <IT>Holy Scriptures</IT> have prepared; <IT>Wise Solomon</IT> hath contributed a good share to this blessed work in his three Books, <IT>Proverbs, Eccle&rehy;siastes, Canticles</IT>.
</P><P>I will not confidently <IT>with Hierome and others</IT>, entitle <IT>Solomons three books</IT>, to his three <IT>Names</IT>; <NOTE

</P><P>But of this I am sure; The book of <IT>Proverbs</IT> is sutable to its <IT>Title</IT>, worthy of <IT>Wise Salomon the sonne of David king of Israel, Prov.</IT> 1.1.

Ancient Writers used many wanton Metaphors, and such a liberty of expression, before the mystery of iniqui&rehy;ty was discovered, which deluded others.

A Doctrine that undermineth the merit and satisfaction of our Savi&rehy;ours death; that will scarce allow faith to swimme, where reason cannot wade; that will so farre bring downe Religion to reason, that we must beleeve lit&rehy;tle more in Divinity, then we can see in reason. <IT>Ar&rehy;minianisme</IT> gratifieth the <IT>pride of will; Popery</IT> the <IT>pride of outward sense</IT>, and <IT>Socinianisme</IT> the <IT>pride of carnall reason</IT>.</ITEM>

After he had gon to <IT>Venice</IT> to the Popes Legate, with whom, out of carnall feare, he complyed, craving pardon of him, and yeelding to recant that religi&rehy;on he had publickely professed; when he <IT>returned to his house, he could not rest an houre, no not a minute, nor feele any ease of his continuall anguish</IT>; from that night he was much terrifyed with horror, and as he con&rehy;fesseth, <IT>He sawe plainely before his eyes all the torments of hell and the damned; and in his soule did heare the fearefull sentence, being drawne before the Judgement seate of Christ</IT>. Hold fast the Truth, let faith triumph over feares. If <IT>Peter</IT> will deny and forsweare his Master, at best he must returne by weeping crosse: <NOTE

REND="it">If any one draw backe, my soule shall have no pleasure in him.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly, <IT>That you will not sell Truth for your own private advantages</IT>. It was a wretched carriage in <IT>Demetrius</IT>, and his fraternity, who out of love to their owne gaine, did combine and consult how they might undermine and betray the Truth. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Act. 19.24,25.</NOTE> <IT>Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth</IT>; This made them so zealous for their <IT>Diana</IT>; and so fierce against the Gospell; If Truth doe prevaile, <IT>Diana</IT> must downe, and then farewell their profit. Resolve rather to re&rehy;semble <IT>Moses</IT> then <IT>Demetrius</IT>, who, <IT>Heb.</IT> 11.25. <Q
REND="it">Chose <PB N="57">rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</Q> His Faith did so rightly enforme his Judgement, that he counted the <IT>Reproaches</IT> of Christ, (which seem the bitterest thing in Christianity) <IT>greater riches then the treasures in Egypt</IT>, ver. 26. How much did he then preferre the Consolations, which come by Religion, before all worldly excellencies? Such a spirit was in <IT>Lu&rehy;ther</IT>, who when he was offered to be Cardinall, if he would be quiet, replyed, no, <IT>Not if I might be Pope</IT>. He had an holy scorne to be put off from his Religious designes, by such withering petty things.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <IT>Sell not Truth for politicke State ends</IT>.</P>
<P>When you come to settle Religion doe not deale onely like politicians, but like Christians. <IT>Worldly wisedome</IT> in the things of God is a rule too <IT>short</IT>, too <IT>crooked</IT>, too <IT>partiall</IT>, yea foolishnesse with God. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">1 Cor. 3.19.</NOTE> <IT>Ie&rehy;roboam</IT> would play the politician in Religion, he sold the true worship of God for his State ends, and for ever inherits this as a blot upon his name, 1 King. 15.30. <Q

In things about <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">meum</FOREIGN> & <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">tuum</FOREIGN>, that concerne our owne interest, we may be more liberall, but in Church af&rehy;faires the word of truth must guide us. It is not in <PB

<P>Fourthly, <IT>Sell not the Truth for pretences of Church peace</IT>. I confesse the name of peace smels very sweete; and now especially (in the midst of such Church distra&rehy;ctions and such wantonnesse of opinions) were to be purchased at any rate, except with the losse of Truth; <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Eph. 4.3.13.</NOTE> It is a most lovely sight to see unity of peace imbrace unity of faith; to behold the household of faith, the family of love; O that we could all ob&rehy;serve the present breaches with the same affectons that <IT>Augustine</IT> did the differences betwixt <IT>Hierome</IT> and <IT>Ruffine.</IT> <NOTE

We must not receive Babylonish inmates into the Lords House. Light and darkenesse, Truth and er&rehy;ror, will never long dwell quietly together.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <IT>Sell not Truth for the pompe of humane Ce&rehy;remonies</IT>. Admit that <IT>Ceremonies</IT> were first let into the Church, with the faire <IT>intention</IT> of the guiders and leaders; and entertayned by the <IT>credulity</IT> of well-meaning people, before the mystery of iniqui&rehy;ty was much knowne; yet since, being so <IT>superstiti&rehy;ously</IT> abused by the Pope and his party, and so rigid&rehy;ly pressed, for the upholding the pompe of Prelacy, <PB

<P>If you doe fully come off, to give in your hands, your hearts, your sealing actions, that you will not upon any termes sell the Truth, as you tread in good <IT>Hezekiahs</IT> steps, I doubt not but the Lord will Crowne your piety and paines with his Diadem, 2 <IT>Chron.</IT> 31.20,21.
