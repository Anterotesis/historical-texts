<P>&Bic;Eing on the 7 of this instant <IT>June</IT> 1649 informed by the Assessors of the Parish of <IT>Swainswicke</IT>, that I was assessed at 2l. 5.s. for three months <IT>Contribution</IT>, by vertue of a (pretended) <IT>Act of the Commons assembled in Parlia&rehy;ment</IT>, bearing date the 7 of <IT>April</IT> last, assessing the Kingdom at ninty thousand pounds monthly, beginning from the 25 of <IT>March</IT> last, and continuing for six months next ensuing, <IT>towards the maintenance of the forces to be continued in England and Ire&rehy;land, and the paying of such as are thought fit to be disbanded, that so Free-quarter may be taken off</IT>; whereof 3075l. 17s. 1 d.ob. is monthly imposed on the County, and 2l. 5s. 3d. on the small poor Parish where I live; and being since on the 15 of <IT>June</IT> required to pay in 2l. 5s. for my proportion: I returned the <IT>Collector</IT> this Answer, That I could neither in <IT>Conscience, Law, nor Prudence in the least measure submit to the voluntary payment of this illegal Tax, and unreasonable Contribution, (af&rehy;ter all my unrepaired losses and sufferings for the publick Li&rehy;berty) amounting to six times more then</IT> Ship-money (the times considered) <IT>or any other illegall Tax of the late beheaded King, so much declaimed against in our three last Parliaments by some of those who imposed this. And that I would rather submit to the painfullest death and severest punishment the Imposers or Ex&rehy;actors of it could inflict upon me by their arbitrary power (for le&rehy;gall they had none) then voluntarily pay, or not oppose it in my place and calling to the uttermost, upon the same, if not better reasons as I oppugned</IT> <NOTE

N="2">it not from meer obstinacy or sullennesse; but out of solid reall grounds of <IT>Conscience, Law, Prudence</IT>, and publick affection to the weal and Liberty of my native Country (now in danger of being enslaved unter <IT>a new vassalage</IT>, more grievous then the worst it ever yet sustained under the late, or any other of our worst Kings) I promised to draw up the Reasons of this my re&rehy;fusal in writing, and to publish them so soon as possible to the <IT>Kingdom</IT>, for my own <IT>Vindication</IT>, and the better information and satisfaction of all such as are any wayes concerned in the imposing, collecting, levying, or paying of this strange kinde of Contribution. In pursuance whereof, I immediately penned these ensuing <IT>Reasons</IT>; which I humbly submit to the <IT>imparti&rehy;all Censure</IT> of all <IT>conscientious</IT> and <IT>judicious Englishmen</IT>; de&rehy;siring either their <IT>ingenuous Refutation</IT>, if <IT>erronious</IT>; or <IT>candid Approbation</IT>, if <IT>substantiall and irrefragable</IT>, as my <IT>conscience</IT> and <IT>judgment</IT> perswade me they are, and that they will appear so to all <IT>impartiall Persons</IT>, after full examination.
</P><P>First, By the fundamental Laws, and known Statutes of this Realme, No Tax, Tallage, Ayd, Imposition, Contribution, Loan or Assessment whatsoever may or ought to be imposed or levied on the free men and people of this Realm of <IT>England</IT>, but by the WILL and COMMON ASSENT of the EARLS, BARONS, Knights, Burgesses, Commons and WHOLE REALM in a free and full PARLIAMENT, by ACT OV PARLIAMENT: All <IT>Taxes</IT> &amp;c. not so imposed, levyed (though for the common defence and profit of the Realm) <IT>being unjust, oppressive, inconsistent with the liberty and propertie of the Subject, Laws and Statues of the Realm</IT>; as is undeniably evident by the expresse Statues of <IT>Magna Charta</IT>, cap. 29. 30. 25.

And fully agreed and demonstrated by Mr. <IT>William Hackwell</IT> in his <IT>Arguments against Impositions</IT>; Judge <IT>Hutton</IT> and Judge <IT>Crook</IT> in their <IT>Arguments</IT>, and Mr. <IT>St. John</IT> in his <IT>Argument</IT> and <IT>Speech</IT> against <IT>Ship-money</IT>, with other <IT>Ar<PB

But the present Tax of Ninety Thousand pounds a Month, now exacted of me, was not thus imposed. Therefore it ought not to be demanded of, nor le&rehy;vied on me; and I ought in conscience, Law, and prudence to withstand it as unjust, oppressive, inconsistent with the Liberty and Property of the Subject, Law and Statutes of the Realm.</P>
<P>To make good the Assumption, which is onely questionable.</P>
<P>First, This Tax was not imposed in, but out of any Parlia&rehy;ment, the late Parliament being actually dissolved above two months before this pretended Act of these Tax-imposers taking away the King by a violent death, as is expresly resolved by the Parliament of 1.

The rather, because they are the far major part (above six times as many as those that sate and shut them out) and would no wayes have consented to this illegall Tax, or undue manner of imposing it, without the Lords concurrence, had they been present. And, I myself, being both an unjustly imprisoned and secluded Member, and neither of the Knights of the County of <IT>Somerset</IT>, where I live, present or consenting to this Tax or Act, one or both of them being forced thence by the Army, I conceive neither my self, nor the County where I live, nor the Burrough for which I served, in the least measure bound by this Act or Tax, but cleerly exempted from them, and ob&rehy;liged with all my might and power effectually to oppose them.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Object.</IT></NOTE> If any here object, That by the custome of Parliament 40 Members onely are sufficient to make a Commons House of Par<PB

<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Answ.</IT></NOTE> I answer, First, That though regularly it be true, that forty Members are sufficient to make a Commons House to begin prayers, and businesses of lesser moment in the beginning of the day, till the other Members come, and the House be full; yet forty were never in any Parliament reputed a competent num&rehy;ber to grant Subsidies, passe, or record Bils, or debate or con&rehy;clude matters of greatest moment; which by the constant Rules and usage of Parliament, were never debated, concluded passed, but in a <IT>free</IT> and <IT>full House</IT>, when all or most of the Members were present, as the Parliament <IT>Rolls, Journals, <FOREIGN

<P>Secondly, Though forty Members onely may peradventure make an House in cases of absolute necessity, when the rest through sicknesse, and publick or private occasions, are voluntarily or negligently absent; and might freely repair thither to sit or give their Votes if they pleased: yet forty Members never yet made a Commons House by custome of Parliament (there being never yet any such case till now) when the rest (being above four hundred) were forcibly secluded, or driven thence by an Army, through the practice or connivance of those forty sitting, of pur&rehy;pose that they should not over nor counter-vote them; much lesse an House to sequester or expell the other Members, or im&rehy;pose any Tax upon them. Till they shew me such a Law, Custom, or President of Parliament (not to be found in any age) all they pretend is nothing to purpose, or the present case.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Neither forty members, nor a whole House of Commons were ever enough in any age, by the Custom of Parlia<PB
N="10">ment, or Law of England, to impose a Tax, or make any Act of Parliament, without the King and Lords, as I have <NOTE

Baronet <IT>Camoyes</IT> Cafe, <IT>discharged from being Knight of the Shire by the Kings Writ and Judgment, be&rehy;cause a Peer of the Realm</IT>; the practice of sequestring and ex&rehy;pelling Commons by their fellow-Commons onely, being a late dangerous, unparliamentary usurpation (unknown to our An&rehy;cestors) destructive to the priviledges and freedom of Parlia&rehy;ments, and injurious to those Counties, Cities, Burroughs, whose Trustees are secluded; the House of Commons it self being no Court of Justice to give either an Oath or finall Sentence, and having no more Authority to dismember their fellow-Mem&rehy;bers, then any Judges, Justices of Peace, or Committees have to dis-judge, dis-justice, or dis-committee their fellow Judges, Ju&rehy;stices and Committee-men, being all of equall authority, and made Members onely by the Kings Writ and Peoples Election, not by the Houses, or other Members Votes; who yet now pre&rehy;sume both to make and unmake, seclude and recall, expell and restore their fellow-Members at their pleasure, contrary to the practice and resolution of former ages, to patch up a <IT>factious Conventicle</IT> in stead of an <IT>English Parliament</IT>. Therefore this Objection no ways invalids this first Reason; why I neither can nor dare submit to this illegall Tax in <IT>Conscience, Law</IT>, or <IT>Pru&rehy;dence</IT>, which engage me to oppose it in all these respects.</P>
<P>Secondly, Should I voluntarily submit to pay this Tax, and that by vertue of an Act of Parliament made by those now sit&rehy;ting, (some of whose Elections have been voted voyd; otheres of them elected by new illegall Writs under a new kind of Seal, <PB

As First, That there may be and now is a lawfull Parliament of England actu&rehy;ally in being and legally continuing after the Kings death, consi&rehy;sting only of a few late Members of the Commons House, with&rehy;out either King, Lords or most of their fellow Commons: which the very Consciences and judgments of all now sitting, that know any thing of Parliaments, and the whole Kingdome if they durst speak their knowledg, know and beleeve to be false, yea against their Oaths and Covenant. Secondly, That this Parliament (so unduly constituted and packed by power of an Army combining with them) hath a just and lawfull Authority to violate the Privi&rehy;ledges, Rights, Freedoms, Customes, and alter the constitution of our Parliaments themselves; imprison seclude, expell most of their fellow Members for voting according to their consciences; to repeal all Votes, Ordinances and Acts of Parliament they please, erect new Arbitrary Courts of war and Justice to arraign, condemn, execute the King himself, with the Peers and Com&rehy;mons of this Realm by a new kind of Martiall Law, contrary to <IT>Magna Charta</IT>, the <IT>Petition of Right</IT>, and <IT>Law</IT> of the Land: dis&rehy;inherit the Kings Posterity of the Crowne, extirpate Monarchy and the whole House of Peers, change and subvert the ancient Government, Seals, Laws, Writs, Legall proceedings Courts, and coyne of <CORR

N="12">selves (like so many antichristian Popes) with all the Subjects of <IT>England</IT> and <IT>Ireland</IT>, from all the Oaths and engagements they have made TO THE KINGS MAJESTY, HIS HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS: yea, from their very Oath of <IT>Allegiance</IT>, nothwithstanding this express clause in it (which I desire may be seriously and conscienciously considered by all who have sworne it) I <IT>do beleeve and in Conscience am resolved, that neither the Pope</IT>, NOR ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER HATH POWER TO ABSOLVE ME OF THIS OATH, OR ANY PART THERE&rehy;OF, which I acknowledge by good and full Authority to be law&rehy;fully ministred unto me, and DO RENOUNCE ALL PAR&rehy;DONS AND DISPENSATIONS TO THE CONTRARY: dispense with our Protestations, Solemn League and Covenant, so lately <IT>zealously urged and injoyned by both Houses on Mem&rehy;bers, Officers, Ministers, and all sorts of People throughout the Realme</IT>: dispose of the Forts, Ships, Forces, Officers, and Places of Honour, Power, Trust or profit within the Kingdom to whom they please; to displace and remove whom they please from their Offices, Trusts, Pensions, Callings, at their pleasures with&rehy;out any legall cause or tryall: to make what new Acts, Lawes, and reverse what old ones they think meet, to insnare inthrall our Consciences, Estates, Liberties, Lives: to create new <IT>monstrous Treasons</IT> never heard of in the world before; and declare <IT>reall treasons</IT> against <IT>King, Kingdome, Parliament</IT>, to be no <IT>treasons</IT>, and <IT>Loyalty, Allegiance, due obedience</IT> to our knowne Lawes, and consciencious observing of our Oaths and Covenant (the breach whereof would render us <IT>actuall Traytors</IT> and <IT>perni&rehy;cious persons</IT>) to be no lesse then <IT>High Treason</IT>, for which they may justly <IT>imprison, dismember, disfranchise, displace and fine us</IT> at their wills (as they have done some of late) <IT>and confiscate our per&rehy;sons and lives to the Gallowes, and our estates to their new Exche&rehy;quer</IT>; ( a Tyranny beyond all Tyrannies ever heard of in our Nati&rehy;on, repealing <IT>Magna Charta</IT>, c. 29. 5.

All which with other particulars lately acted and endowed by the Imposers of this <IT>Tax</IT>, by colour of that pretended Parliamentary Authori&rehy;ty by which they have imposed it, I must necessarily admit, ac&rehy;knowledge to be just and legall by my voluntary payment of it, of purpose to maintaine an Army to justify and make good all this, by the meer power of the Sword; which they can no wayes justify and defend by the Laws of God or the Realm, before a&rehy;ny Tribunall of God or Men when legally arraigned as they shall one day be. Neither of which I can or dare acknowledge with&rehy;out incurring the guilt of most <IT>detestable Perjury</IT>, and <IT>Highest Treason</IT>, <corr sic="against, King">against King,</corr> Kingdom, Parliament, Laws and Liberties of the People: and therefore cannot yeeld to this Assessement.</P>
<P><IT>Thirdly</IT>. The principall ends and uses proposed in the preten&rehy;ded Act and Warrants thereupon for payment of this <IT>Tax</IT> are strong Obligations to me, in point of <IT>Conscience, Law, Prudence</IT>, to withstand it; which I shall particularly discusse.</P>
<P>The First is, the maintenance and continuance of the present Army and forces in <IT>England</IT> under the Lord <IT>Fairfax</IT>. To which I say, First, as I shall with all readinesse, gratitude and due respect acknowledg their former Gallantry, good and faithfull Services to the Parliament and Kingdom, whiles they continued dutiful and constant to their first Engagements and the ends for which they were raised by both Houses, as far forth as any man; so in regard of their monstrous defections and dangerous Apostacy from their Primitive obdience, faithfulnesse and engagements in disobeying the Commands and levying open warre against both Houses of Parliament, keeping an horrid force upon them at their very doors, seising, imprisoning, secluding, abusing and forcing away their Members, printing and publishing many high and treasonable Declarations against the Institution, Priviledges, Members and Proceedings of the late, and being of all future Parliaments; imprisoning, abusing, arraigning, condemning and <PB
N="14">executing our late King, against the Votes, faith, and engage&rehy;ments of both Houses, and disinheriting his Posterity, usurping the Regal, Parliamental, Magistratical, and Ecclesiastical power of the Kingdom to their Generall Councel of Officers of the Army, as the supreme swaying Authority of the Kingdom, and attempting to alter and subvert the ancient Government, Parlia&rehy;ments, Laws, and Customs of our Realm: And upon serious consideration of the ordinary unsufferable Assertions of their Officers and Souldiers uttered in most places where they quar&rehy;ter, and to my self in particular, sundry times. <IT>That the whole Kingdom, with all our Lands, Houses, goods, and whatsoever we have, is theirs, and that by right of conquest, they having twice conquered the Kingdom: That we are but their conquered slaves and Vassals, and they the Lords and Heads of the Kingdome: That our very lives are at their mercy and courtesie. That when they have gotten all we have from us by Taxes and Free-quarter, and we have nothing left to pay them, then themselves will seise upon our Lands as their own, and turn us and our Families out of doors, That there is now no Law in England</IT> (nor never was if we beleeve their lying Oracle <IT>Peters) but the sword</IT>; with many such like vapouring Speeches and discourses, of which there are thousands of witnesses: I can neither in <IT>Conscience, Law</IT> nor <IT>Prudence</IT> assent, much lesse contribute in the least de&rehy;gree, for their present maintenance, or future continuance, thus to insult, inslave, and tyrannize over King, Kingdom, Parliament, people at their pleasure, like their conquered vassals. And for me in particular to contribute to the maintenance of those, who against the Law of the Land, the priviledges of Parliament, and liberty of the Subject, pulled me forcibly from the Commons House, and kept me prisoner about two months space under their Martiall, to my great expence and prejudice, without any parti&rehy;cular cause pretended or assigned, only for discharging my du&rehy;ty to the Kingdom, and those for whom I served in the House, without giving me the least reparation for this unparallell'd in&rehy;justice, or acknowledging their offence (and yet detain some of my then fellow-Members under custody by the meer power of the Sword without bringing them to tryall) would be not onely absurd, unreasonable, and a tacite justification of this their horrid violence and breach of priviledge, but monstrous un<PB
N="15">naturall, perfidious, against my Oath and Covenant.</P>
<P>2. No Tax ought to be imposed on the Kingdom in Parlia&rehy;ment it self, but in case of necessity, for its common Good, as is cleer by the Stat. of 25. E. 1. c. 6. and <IT>Cooks</IT> 2 Instit. p. 528. Now it is evident to me, that there is no necessity of keeping up this Ar&rehy;my for the Kingdoms common Good, but rather a necessity of disbanding it, or the greatest part of it, for these reasons: 1. Be&rehy;cause the Kingdom is generally exhausted with the late 7 years Wars, Plunders and heavie Taxes; there being more moneys levied on it by both sides, during these eight last years, then in all the Kings Reigns since the Conquest, as will appear upon a just computation: all Counties being thereby utterly unable to pay it. 2. In regard of the great decay of Trade, the extraordi&rehy;nary dearth of cattel, corn, and provisions of all sorts; the charge of relieving a multitude of poor people, who starve with famine in many places, the richer sort eaten out by Taxes and Free-quarter, being utterly unable to relieve them. To which I might add the multitude of maimed Souldiers, with the wi&rehy;dows and children of those who have lost their lives in the Wars, which is very costly. 3. This heavie Contribution to support the Army, destroys all Trade, by fore-stalling and engrossing most of the moneys of the Kingdom, the sinews and life of Trade; wasting the provisions of the Kingdom and enhansing their prices, keep&rehy;ing many thousands of able men and horses idle, only to consume other labouring mens provisions, estates and the publick Trea&rehy;sure of the Kingdom, when as their imployment in their trades and callings, might much advance trading, and enrich the King&rehy;dom. 4. There is now no visible Enemy in the field or Garisons, and the sitting Members boast there is no fear from any abroad, their Navie being so Victorious. And why such a vast Army should be still continued in the Kingdom to increase its debts and payments, when charged with so many great Ar&rehy;rears and debts already, eat up the Country with Taxes and Free-quarter, only to play, drink, whore, steal, rob, murther, quarrel, fight with, impeach and shoot one another to death as Traytors, Rebels, and Enemies to the Kingdom and Peoples Liberties, as now the Levellers and Cromwellists do, for want of other imployments, and this for the publick good, transcends my understanding. 5. When the King had two great Armies <PB
N="16">in the Field, and many Garisons in the Kingdom, this whole Ar&rehy;my by its primitive Establishment, consisted but of twenty two thousand Horse, Dragoons, and Foot, and had an Establishment only of about forty five thousand pounds a month for their pay; which both Houses then thought sufficient, as is evident by their <NOTE
N="(o)" PLACE="margin">Collect. &amp;c. pag. 599. 8m76.</NOTE> Ordinances of Febr. 15. 1644. and April 4. 1646. And when the Army was much increased without their Order, sixty thousand pounds a month was thought abundantly sufficient by the Officers and Army themselves to disband and reduce all su&rehy;per-numeraries, maintain the Established Army and Garisons, and ease the Country of all Free-quarter; which Tax hath been constantly paid in all Counties. Why then this Tax to the Army should now be raised above the first Establishment, when redu&rehy;ced to twenty thousand, whereof sundry Regiments are designed for <IT>Ireland</IT>, (for which there is thirty thousand pounds a month now exacted besides the sixty for the Army) and this for the common good of the Realm, is a riddle unto me, or rather, a Mystery of iniquity, for some mens private lucre, rather then the publick weal. 6. The <IT>Militia</IT> of every County (for which there was so great contest in Parliament with the late King) and these persons of livelihood and estates in every Shire or Corpo&rehy;ration who have been cordiall to the Parliament and Kingdom heretofore, put into a posture of defence under Gentlemen of quality and known integrity, would be a far better Guard to se&rehy;cure the Kingdom against forraign Invasions or domestick In&rehy;surrections, then a mercinary Army of persons and souldiers of no fortunes, and that with more generall content, and the tenth part of that charge the Kingdom is now at to maintain this Ar&rehy;my, and prevent all danger of the undoing pest of Free-quarter. Therefore there is no necessity to keep up this Army, or impose any new Tax for their maintenance, or defraying their pretend&rehy;ed arrears, which I dare averr, the Free-quarter they have taken in kinde, and levied in money, if brought to a just account, as it ought, will double if not treble most of their Arrears, and make them much indebted to the Country. And no reason they should have full pay and Free-quarter, too, and the Country bear the burthen of both, without full allowance of all the quarters levied or taken on them against Law, out of their pretended arrears.</P>
<PB N="17"><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Object.</IT></NOTE> And if any of the sitting <IT>Tax-makers</IT> here object, That they dare not trust the <IT>Militia</IT> of the Cities and Counties of the Realm with their own or the Kingdoms defence: Therefore there is a necessity for them to keep the Army, to prevent all dangers from abroad, and Insurrections at home.
</P><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin"><IT>Ans.</IT></NOTE> I answer, 1. That upon these pretences these new Lords may intail and enforce an Army, and Taxes to support them, on the Kingdom till Dooms-day 2. If they be reall members who make this objection, elected by the Counties, Cities and Bur&rehy;roughs for which they serve, and deriving their Parliamental Au&rehy;thority onely from the people (the <IT>only new fountain of all Power and Authority</IT>, as themselves now dogmatize) then they are but the Servants and Trustees, who are to allow them wages, and give them Commission for what they act. And if they dare not now trust the people, and those persons of quality, fidelity, and estate, who both elected, intrusted and impowred them, and are the primitive and supreme Power; it is high time for their Electors and Masters the people, to revoke their authority and trusts, and no longer to trust those with their purses, liberties, safety, who dare not now to confide in them, and would rather commit the safeguard of the Kingdom to mercinary, indigent soudiers, then to those Gentlemen, Free-holders, Citizens, Bur&rehy;gesses, and persons of Estate who elected them, whose Trustees and Attourneys only they professe themselves, and who have greatest interest both in them and the Kingdoms weal, and those who must pay these Mercinaries, if continued. 3. The Gentle&rehy;men and Free-men of <IT>England</IT> have very little reason any longer to trust the Army with the Kingdoms, Parliaments, or their own Liberties, Laws, and Priviledges safeguard, which they have so oft invaded; professing now that they did not fight to preserve the Kingdom, King, Parliament, Laws, Liberties. and Proper&rehy;ties of the Subject; but to conquer and pull them down, and make us conquered slaves instead of free-men: averring, that <IT>all is theirs by conquest</IT>. And if so, then this Army is not, cannot be upheld and maintained for the Kingdoms and peoples com&rehy;mon good and safety, but their enslaving, destruction, and the meer support of the usurped Power, Authority, Offices, Wealth, and absolute Domination only of those who have exalted them&rehy;selves for the present above King, Parliament, Kingdom, Laws, <PB
N="18">Liberties, and those that did intrust them, by the help of this trust-breaking Army, who have stained all the glory of their for&rehy;mer Noble Victories and Heroick Actions, by their late dege&rehy;nerous unworthy practices, and are become a reproach to the English Nation in all Christian Kingdoms and Churches.</P>
<P>The second end of this heavie Tax, is the support and mainte&rehy;nance of the Forces in <IT>Ireland</IT>, for which there was onely twen&rehy;ty thousand pounds a month formerly allowed, now mounted unto thirty thousand.</P>
<P>To which I answer in the first place, That it is apparent by the printed Statutes of 25. E. 1. c. 6. 1. E. 3. cap. 5.7. 18. E. 3. c. 7. 25. E. 3. c. 8. 4. H. 4. cap. 13. <IT>Cooks</IT> 2 Institutes p. 528. and the <IT>Protestations of all the Commons of England in the Parliaments</IT> of 1 H. 5. nu. 17. and 7. H. 5. n. 9. <QUOTE><IT>That no freeman of England ought to be compelled to go in person, or to finde Souldiers, Arms, Conduct-money, Wages, or pay any Tax for or towards the main&rehy;tenance of any forreign War in</IT> Ireland, <IT>or any other parts be&rehy;yond the Sea, without their free consents in full Parliament</IT>.</QUOTE> And therefore this Tax to maintain Souldiers and the War in <IT>Ireland</IT> (neither imposed in Parliament, much lesse in a full and free one, as I have proved) must needs be illegall, and no ways obli&rehy;gatory to me, or any other. 2. Most of the ancient Forces in <IT>Ireland</IT> (as the <IT>Brittish Army, Scots</IT>, and <IT>Inchiqueen's</IT>) towards whose support the twenty thousand pounds a month was de&rehy;signed, have been ever since declared <IT>Rebels, Traytors, Revol&rehy;ters</IT>, and are not to share in the Contribution: and those now pretending for <IT>Ireland</IT>, being members of the present Army and to be paid out of that Establishment, there is no ground at all to augment, but decrease this former monthly Tax for <IT>Ireland</IT>, o&rehy;ver what it was before. 3. Many of those now pretending for <IT>Ireland</IT>, have been the greatest obstructers of its relief hereto&rehy;fore: and many of those designed for this Service by lot, have in words, writing, and print protested they never intend to go thither, and disswade others from going, yet take free-quarter on the Country and pay too under that pretext. And to force the Country to pay Contribution and give Free-quarter to such Cheaters and Impostors, who never intend this Service, is both unjust and dishonourable. 4. If the Relief of <IT>Ireland</IT> be now really intended, it is not upon the first just and pious ground, to <PB
N="19">preserve the Protestant party there from the forces of the bloo&rehy;dy Popish Irish Rebels, with whom (if report be true) these sitting <IT>Anti-Monarchists</IT> seek and hold correspondence, and are now actually accorded with <IT>Owen Ro-Oneal</IT> and his party of blodiest Papists; but to oppose the Kings interest and title to that Kingdome, and the Protestant remaining party there adhering to and proclaiming, acknowledging him for their Soveraign; least his gaining of <IT>Ireland</IT> should prove fatall to their usurped soveraignty in <IT>England</IT>, or conduce to his enthroning here: And by what Authority these now sitting can impose, or with what conscience any loyall Subject who hath taken the Oaths of <IT>Supremacy, Allegiance</IT>, and <IT>Covenant</IT> can voluntarily pay any con&rehy;tribution to deprive the King of his hereditary right & undoubt&rehy;ed Title to the Kingdoms and Crowns of <IT>England</IT> & <IT>Ireland</IT> and alter the frame of the ancient Government & Parliaments of our Kingdoms <NOTE

<P><IT>Thirdly, Levying of the contribution by souldiers and force of arms, in case of resistance, and imprisoning the person by like force</IT>: ad&rehy;judged <IT>High Treason</IT> in the cases of the Earl of <IT>Strafford, and a levying of war within the Statute of</IT> 25.Ed.2. by the late Parlia&rehy;ment, for which he lost his head: and so proved to be at large by Master <IT>St. Iohn</IT> in his <IT>Argument at Law at the passing the Bill for his attainder, Printed by Order of the Commons House</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Fourthly</IT>, (Which heightens the illegality of these illegall means of levying it) if any person whose goods are destrained, or person imprisoned for this illegall tax, shall bring his <IT>Action at Law</IT>, or an <IT>Habeas corpus</IT> for his relief. The <IT>Committee of Indemp&rehy;nity</IT> will stay his legall proceeding, award cost against him, and commit him anew till he pay them, and release his suits at Law, and upon an <IT>Habeas corpus</IT>, their own Sworn Judges created by them, dare not bayle but remaund him against Law. An oppression and Tyranny, far exceeding the worst of the <IT>Behead&rehy;ed Kings</IT>; under whom the Subjects had <IT>Free-Liberty</IT> to sue and preceed at Law both in the cases of <IT>Loanes, Shipmony</IT> and <IT>Knight&rehy;hood</IT>, whithout any <IT>Councel Table, Committee of Indempnity</IT> to stop their suits, or inforce them to release them; and therefore in all these respects (so repugnant to the Laws and Liberty of the Sub&rehy;ject) I cannot submit to his illegall Tax, but oppugn it to the uttermost, most invasive on our Laws and Liberties, that ever was.</P>
<P><IT>Fifthly</IT>, The time of opposing this illegall Tax, with these un&rehy;lawfull ways of levying it, is very considerable and sticks much with me; it is (as the Imposers of it declare and publish in ma&rehy;ny of their new kind of Acts and devices) <IT>in the first yeare of Englands Liberty, and redemption from thraldom</IT>. And if this unsup&rehy;portable Tax, thus illegally to be levied, be the <IT>first fruits</IT> of our <IT>first years Freedom</IT>, and <IT>redemption from thraldom</IT>, how great may we expect our next years <IT>thraldome</IT> will be, when this <IT>little finger of theirs is heavier by far then the Kings whole loynes, whom they be&rehy;headed for Tyranny and Oppression</IT>?</P>
<P><IT>Sixthly</IT>, The Order of this Tax (if I may so term a disorder) or rather <IT>newnesse</IT> of it, engageth me, and all overs of their Countries Liberty, unanimously to withstand the same. It is the first, I finde, that was ever imposed by any who had been Mem<PB
N="21">bers of the Commons House after a Parliament dissolved; the Lords House voted down, and most of their fellow-Commoners secured or secluded by their connivance or confederacy with an undutiful Army. VVhich if submitted to, and not opposed as illegall, any forty or fifty Commoners, who have been Members of a Parliament, gaining Forces to assist and countenance them, may out of Parliament now, or any time hereafter, do the like, and impose what Taxes and Laws they please upon the King&rehy;dom and the secluded Lords and Commons that once sate with them, being incouraged thereto by such an unopposed prece&rehy;dent. VVhich being of so dangerous consequence and exam&rehy;ple to the constitution and priviledges of Parliament, and Liber&rehy;ties of the people, we ought all to endeavour the crushing of this new <IT>Cockatrice</IT> in the shell, lest it grow to a <IT>fiery Serpent</IT>, to consume and sting us to death, and induce the Imposers of it, to lade us with new and heavie <IT>Taxes</IT> of this kinde, when this expires (which we must expect, when all the Kings, Bishops, Deans and Chapters Lands are sold and spent) if we patiently submit to this leading <IT>Decoy</IT>; since <NOTE

Yea, it is such a Grievance, as exposeth the houses, goods, provisions, moneys, servants, children, wives, lives, and all other earthly comforts we enjoy, to the lusts and pleasure of every domineering Officer, and unruly common Souldier. And to impose an unjust, heavy Tax, and induce peo&rehy;ple to pay it upon hopes of freeing them from <IT>Free-quarter</IT>, is but to impose one grievance to remove another.</P>
<P>2. There have been <IT>many promises, Declarations and Orders of both Houses and the Generall</IT>, for taking <IT>off Free quarter heretofore</IT>, upon the peoples paying in their Contributions before-hand, as now: and <IT>then none should Free-quarter on them, under pain of death</IT>; Yet no sooner have they pay'd in their Contribution, but <PB
N="24">they have been freequartered on as much or more then formerly: the Souldiers, when we tell them of any Orders against Free&rehy;quarter, slighting them as so many wast papers, and carrying themselves more unruly: And when complaint thereof hath been made to the Officers, Members, or the Committee for the Army, or in the House; answer hath still been made, <IT>That as long as there is an Army on foot, there will be freequarter taken, and there can be no prevention of it, there being a necessity of it</IT>: and when any have craved allowance of it; they have found so many put-offs and delayes, and such difficulties in obtaining it, that their expences have equalled their allowance; and after allow&rehy;ances made, the moneys allowed have been called for again. So as few have had any allowance for quarters, and given over suing for them, being put to play an <IT>after-game</IT> to sue for them after all their contributions first paid, and not to deduct them out of their Contributions, which they are still put to do. This pre&rehy;text therefore of taking sway Free-quarter, is but a <IT>shoo-horn</IT> to draw on the payment of this Tax, and a fair pretext to delude the <IT>People</IT>, as they finde by sad experience every-where, and in the County and Hundred where I reside. For, not to look back to the last yeers free-quarter taken on us (though we daily paie our Contributions,) In <IT>April</IT> and <IT>May</IT> last past, since this very Tax imposed for taking away Free-quarter, <IT>Colonel Harrisons</IT> Troopers under the command of Captain <IT>Spencer</IT>, (who quar&rehy;tered six days together in a place, and exacted and received most of them 3s. others 3s. 6d. and the least 2s. 6d. a day for their Quarters, telling their Landlords, that their Lands, and the whole Kingdom was theirs) have put <IT>Bathwick, Bathford, Claverton, Combe, Hampton, Toustock, Walcot</IT>, and <IT>Wedcombe</IT>, small parishes in our Hundred and Liberty, as they will prove upon Oath, and given it me under their hands, to 94li. 4s. 3d. charge; beside what quarters in other parishes of the Hundred Sir <IT>Hardresse Wallers</IT> Souldiers upon pretext of collecting arrears of Contri&rehy;bution not due from the hundred, put it to at least 30l. charge more for free-quarter, they being very rude and disorderly; and no sooner were we quit of them: but on the 22 and 23 of <IT>May</IT> last, Col. <IT>Hunks</IT> his Foot under the conduct of Captain <IT>Flower</IT> and Captain <IT>Eliot</IT> pretending for <IT>Ireland</IT>, but professing they never intended to go thither, marching from <IT>Minehead</IT> and <IT>Dun&rehy;ster</IT> (the next Westerne Ports to <IT>Ireland</IT> further from it to op<PB
N="25">presse the Country, put <IT>Bathwick, Langridge, Witty, Beatheaston, Eu&rehy;therin</IT> and <IT>Ford</IT> to 28l. 7s. and <IT>Swainswicke</IT>, where I live, to about 20l. expences for three dayes Freequarter (by colour of the Generals Order dated the first of <IT>May</IT>) being the rudest and deboistest in all kinds, that ever quartered since the Warrs, and far worse then the worst of <IT>Goring's</IT> men, whereof some of them were the dreggs; and their Captain <IT>Flower</IT>, a Cavalier hereto&rehy;fore in arms (as is reported) against the Parliament. Their car&rehy;riage in all places was very rude, to extort money from the peo&rehy;ple, drawing out their swords, ransacking their houses, beating and threatning to kill them, if they would not give them two shillings six pence, three shillings, three shillings six pence, or at least two shillings a day for their quarters, which when extortet from some, they took free-quarter upon others, taking two, three, and some four quarters a man: At my house they were most exorbitant, having (as their Quarter-Master told me, who affirmed to me they had twice conquered the Kingdom, and all was theirs) <IT>direction from some great ones above</IT>, from <IT>some others in the Country</IT> (intimidating some of the Committee) <IT>and their own Officers</IT> (who absented themselves purposely, that the <IT>Souldiers</IT> might have none to controll them) <IT>to abuse me</IT>. In pursuance whereof some thirty of them coming to my house, shouting and hollowing in a rude manner on <IT>May</IT> 22, when their Billet was but for twenty, not shewing any Authority, but only a Ticket [Mr. <IT>Prynne</IT> &horfill; 20] climbed over my walls, forced my doors, beat my servants and workmen without any provocation, drew their swords upon me (who demanded whose Souldiers they were, by what authority they demanded free quarter, my house being neither Inne, nor Alehouse; and Free quarter against Law and Orders of Parliament, and the Generals) using many high provoking Speeches, brake some of my windows, forced my stong-beer cellar door, and took the key from my servant, ran&rehy;sacked some of my chambers under pretext to search for Arms, taking away my servants clothes, shirts, stockings, bands, cuffs, handkerchiefs, and picking the money out of one of their pock&rehy;ets; hollowed, roared, stamped, beat the Tables with their Swords and Muskets like so many Bedlams, swearing cursing, and blashpeming at every word; brake the Tankards, Bottles, <PB
N="26">Cups, Dishes, wherein they fetched strong beer against the ground, abused my maid-servants, throwing Beef & other good provisions at their heads, and casting it to the dogs, as no fit meat for Soul&rehy;diers, and the Heads and Conquerors of the Kingdom, as they called themselves; searched the out-houses for Turkies, which they took from their eggs and young ones, Veal and Mutton being not good enough for them: They continued drinking and roar&rehy;ing before, at, and after Supper, till most of them were mad&rehy;drunk, and some of them dead-drunk under the Table. Then they must have 14 beds provided for them (for they would lie but two in a bed) and all their linnen washed: My Sister answering them, that there were not so many beds in the house, and that they must be content as other Souldiers had been, with such beds as could be spared; they thereupon threatned to force open her chamber door, and to pull her and her children out of their beds, unlesse she would give them three shillings a peece for their beds, and next dayes quarters; and at last forced her for fear of their vio&rehy;lence (being all drunk) to give them eighteen pence a peece, assoon as they were forth of doors, and six pence a peece the next day, if they marched not; whereupon they promised to trouble the House no more. Upon this agreement all but eight (who were gone to bed) departed that night, and the rest the next morning. But I going to the Lecture at <IT>Bath</IT>, some thir&rehy;ty of them in my absence came about ten of the clock, not&rehy;withstanding the moneys received of my Sister for their Quar&rehy;ters, re-entered the house, and would have Quarters again, un&rehy;lesse she would give them three shillings a peece; which she re&rehy;fusing, they thereupon abused and beat the servants and work&rehy;men, forced them to drink with them all that day and night, swearing, cursing, roaring like so many Furies and Divels, brake open my Parlour, Milk-house, and Garden-doors, abused my Pictures and brake an hole in one of them; hacked my Table&rehy;boards with their swords from one end to the other, threw the chairs, stools, meat, drink about the house; assaulted my Sister, and her little children and Maid-servants with their naked swords, threatning to kill them and kick them to gelly, shot at them with their Muskets, forced them out of the House to save their lives: which I hearing of, repaired to my house, and find<PB
N="27">ing them all so Bedlam mad, and that they would not hearken to any reason, nor be quieted, I thereupon rode to seek their Captain and Officers at <IT>Bath</IT>, who purposely absented them&rehy;selves; and not finding them till the next morning, I acquaint&rehy;ed the Captain then, (as I had done the first night by Letter) with all these unsufferable outrages of his Souldiers (contrary to the Generals Orders to carry themselves civilly in their quarters, and abuse none in word or deed) which would render him and them odious, not onely to the Country and Kingdom, but all Of&rehy;ficers and Souldiers who had any civility in them, and be a dis&rehy;paragement to the <IT>Generall</IT>, by whose Proclamation he ought to be present with his Company to keep them in good order, un&rehy;der pain of cashiering: And therefore I expected and required Justice and Reparations at his hands; the rather, because I was informed by some of his own Souldiers and others, that they had not been so barbarously rude, but by his incouragement, which if he refused, I should complain of him to his Superiours, and right my self the best way I might. After some expostulations, he promised to make them examples, and cashier them, and remove them forthwith from my house: But the onely right I had, was, that more of his company repaired thither, ma&rehy;king all the spoil they could, and taking away some brasse and Pewter, continuing there till neer four of the clock; and then marched away onely out of fear I would raise the Country upon them; many of whom profered me their assistance; but I desi&rehy;red them to forbear till I saw what their Officers would do; who in stead of punishing any of them, permitted them to play the like <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Rex</FOREIGN> almost in other places where they quartered since, marching but three or four miles a day, and extorting what mo&rehy;neys they could from the Country by their violence and disor&rehy;ders. Now, for me or any other to give moneys to maintain such deboist <IT>Bedlams</IT> and <IT>Beasts</IT> as these (<IT>who boasted of their vil&rehy;lanies and that they had done me at least twenty pounds spoil in Beer and Provisions, drinking out five barrels of good strong Beer, and wasting as much meat as would have served an hundred civill persons</IT>) to be Masters of our Houses, Goods, Servants, Lives, and all we have, to ride over our heads like our Lords, and Conquerours, and take Free quarter on us, amounting to at <PB
N="28">least a full yeares contribution, without any allowance for it, and that since the last Orders against <IT>Free-quarter</IT>, and warrants for paying in this Tax to prevent it for the future, issued; is so far against my reason, Judgement and conscience, that I would ra&rehy;ther give all away to suppress, discard them, or cast it into the fire then maintain such graceless wretches with it to dis&rehy;honour God, enslave, consume, ruine the Country and King&rehy;dome; who everywhere complain of the like insolences; and of taking free quarter since the 9 of <IT>June</IT>, as above two <IT>hundred</IT> of Colonel <IT>Coxe</IT> his men did in <IT>Bath</IT> the last <IT>Lords day</IT>; who drew up in a body about the <IT>Majors</IT> House, and threatned <IT>to seise and carry him away prisoner for denying to give them free quarter, con&rehy;trary to the New Act for abolishing it</IT>. Lastly this pretended <IT>Act</IT> implies, that those who refuse to pay this contribution without distress or imprisonment shall be stil oppressed with freequarter: And what an height of oppression and injustice this will prove not only to distrain & imprison those who cannot in conscience, Law, or prudence submit to this illegall Tax, but likewise to un&rehy;doe them by exposing them to free-quarter, which themselves condemne as the heighst pest and oppression; let all sober men consider; and what reason I and others have to oppose such a dangerous destructive president in its first appearing to the world.</P>
<P>Ninethly, The principal end of imposing this Tax to main&rehy;tain the Army and forces now raised, it not the defence and safe&rehy;ty of our ancient and first Christian Kingdom of <IT>England</IT>, its Par&rehy;liaments, Laws, Liberties, and Religion, as at first, but to disin&rehy;herit the King of the Crown of <IT>England, Scotland</IT>, and <IT>Ireland</IT>, (to which he hath an <IT>undoubted right by common and Statute Law</IT>; as the Parliament of 1 <IT>Jacobi.</IT> ch. I. resolves) and to levy war a&rehy;gainst him to deprive him of it: To subvert the ancient Monar&rehy;chical Government of this Realm, under which our Ancesters have always lived and flourished, to set up a <IT>New republick</IT>, the oppressions and greivances whereof we have already felt (by in&rehy;creasing our Taxes, setting up arbitrary Courts and Proceedings to the taking away of the lives of the late King, Peers, and other Subjects against the Fundamental Laws of the Land, creating new monstrous Treasons never heard off in the world before, and <PB

<P>Tenthly, The payment of this Tax for the premised pur&rehy;poses, will (in my poor judgment and conscience) be offen&rehy;sive to God and all good men, scandalous to the Protestant Religion, dishonourable to our English Nation, and disadvan&rehy;tagious and destructive to our whole Kingdom, hindering the speedy settlement of our Peace, the re-establishment of our Laws and Government, establishing of our Taxes, disbanding of our Forces, revivall of our decayed Trade, by the renewing and perpetuating our bloudy uncivill Warrs; engaging <IT>Scotland, Ireland</IT>, and all forreign Princes and Kingdoms in a just War against us, to avenge the death of our late beheaded King, the <PB
N="30">dis-inheriting of his posterity, and restore his lawfull Heirs and Successors to their just, undoubted Rights, from which they are now forcibly secluded; who will undoubtedly molest us with continuall Warrs (what-ever some may fondly conceit to the contrary) till they be setled in the Throne in peace upon just and honorable terms, and invested in their just possessions. And there&rehy;fore I can neither in conscience, piety nor prudence, ensnare my self in the guilt of all these dangerous consequences, by any sub&rehy;mission to this illegall Tax.</P>
<P>Upon all these weighty Reasons, and serious grounds of Conscience, Law, Prudence, (which I humbly submit to the Consciences and Judgments of all conscientious and Judi&rehy;cious persons, whom they do or shall concern) I am re&rehy;solved by the assistance and strength of that Omnipotent God (who hath miraculously supported me under, and carried me through all my former sufferings for the Peoples publick Li&rehy;berties with exceeding joy, comfort, and the ruine of my grea&rehy;test enemies and Opposers) to oppugne this <IT>unlawfull Con&rehy;tribution</IT>, and the payment of it to the uttermost, in all just and lawfull wayes, I may; And if any will forcibly levie it by di&rehy;stresse or otherwise, without Law or Right (as Theeves and Robbers take mens goods and Purses) let them doe it at their own utmost perill. And I trust God and men will in due season doe me justice, and award me recompence for all the injuries in this kinde, and any sufferings for my Countries Li&rehy;berties. How-ever, fall back, fall edge, I would ten thousand times rather lose life, and all I have, to keep a good consci&rehy;ence, and preserve my native Liberty, then part with one farthing, or gain the whole world with the losse of either of them; and rather die a Martyr for our <IT>Ancient Kingdom</IT> then live a <IT>Slave</IT> under any new <IT>Republick</IT>, or remant of a broken, dismembred, strange Parliament of Commons, with&rehy;out King, Lords, or the major part of the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Realme, in being subject to their <IT>illegall Taxes</IT>, and what they call <IT>Acts of Parliament</IT>, which in reali&rehy;ty are no <IT>Acts</IT> at all to binde me, or any other subject, to obedi&rehy;ence, or just punishment for <IT>Non-obedience</IT> thereunto, or <IT>Non<PB
