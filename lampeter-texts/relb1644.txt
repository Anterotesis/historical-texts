<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 1.</NOTE> &Hic;E that would know the true proper full im&rehy;portance of the word <IT>Scandall or Offence</IT>, or to be <IT>Offended or Scandaliz'd</IT> (as they are taken for the same) need not seeke into many authors for it. The new Testament, and the Apocryphall bookes, and the Greeke transla&rehy;tion of the old Testament, are the prime authors that have used these words, and all other later Christian writers may justly be thought to have had them from that Fountaine; an&rehy;cient prophane writers not affording them. <NOTE
TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 2.</NOTE> From hence 'twill be sure just to inferre, that in as many senses as the scripture Canonicall and Apocryphall hath used the words in so many they may be justly used, and in no more. Now the uses of the word <IT>Scandall</IT> <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">skandalon</FOREIGN></NOTE> among them are either naturall (as generally in the old Testament,) or borrowed, <IT>i.e.</IT> metaphoricall, (as cheifly in the new.) It naturally signifies 3 things. <NOTE
TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 3.</NOTE> 1, A Trapp, a Gin, or Snare to catch anything: So in the Greeke transla&rehy;tion of <IT>Psal.</IT> 69.22. the word is us'd, (being joyn'd with 2 other words which signifie <IT>snare</IT> and <IT>gin</IT>,) and in our new translation is rendred a <IT>trapp</IT>: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">pagis kai th&emacr;ra</FOREIGN></NOTE> wherefore in the place of <IT>Rom.</IT> 11.9. where the same words are cited out of the Septuagints translation, and not out of the Hebrew text of the Psalme, I should conceive it should be rendred by analogy, not <IT>stum&rehy;bling blockes</IT> but <IT>gin</IT>, or some other word belonging to this <PB
N="2">first signification. In this sence it is used 1 <IT>Mac.</IT> 5.4. where it is all one with <IT>snare</IT>, and it is farther interpreted by (<IT>laying wait by the way) to catch them treacherously</IT>. So againe <IT>Wisd:</IT> 14.11. the word is used, and explained by another word, sig&rehy;nifying a <IT>trapp</IT>, or <IT>snare</IT>, the very same that was used in the Psalmes, and to the Romans.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 4.</NOTE> 2. It signifies any <IT>Obstacle</IT> or <IT>hindrance</IT> layed in a mans way, by which the passenger is detain'd or stopt, peculiarly a <IT>sharpe Stake</IT>, such as in time of warre men were wont to put in the fields where their enemy should follow, to wound their feet or leggs in their passage: against which being so ordinary in warre, they anciently used greaves of brasse to de&rehy;fend their feet or leggs. 1. <IT>Sam:</IT> 17.6. to which you may referre that Epithite so frequent in <IT>Homer</IT>, <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">&emacr;ykn&emacr;mides</FOREIGN>, and <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">chalkokn&emacr;mides Achaioi</FOREIGN>: to signifie those greaves brasen or other&rehy;wise, that the Grecians used; described by that Poet, <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">Il. Phi</FOREIGN>, by <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">kn&emacr;mis neoteuktou kassiteroio</FOREIGN> made of tin, and covering the whole legg to the knee, of so firme a substance that it made a loud noise at the stroake of the weapon on it, <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">smerdaleon konab&emacr;se</FOREIGN> saith he. Thus is the word <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">skandalon</FOREIGN> used, <IT>Judith</IT> 5.1. where we render it <IT>impediments</IT>, a word somewhat too generall to signify those sharpe stakes or other instruments to wound or gall the passengers, which are knowne to every body: for which I beleeve we have some proper english word, I thinke it is a <IT>gal-trapp</IT>.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 5.</NOTE> 3&lysup;. The word signifies a <IT>stone</IT> or <IT>blocke</IT> in the way, at which men are apt (if they be not carefull, or of they goe in the darke) to stumble and fall: and thereupon in the old Te&rehy;stament it is taken for a <IT>fall</IT>: and so sometimes for <IT>sinne</IT>, the <IT>fall of the soule</IT>, as <IT>Judith</IT> 12.2. (where these words [<IT>lest it be an offence</IT>] would more clearely be rendred out of the Greeke, <IT>lest it become an offence</IT>, 1.<IT>a sinne</IT> or pollution, as you may see in the same matter which is there treated of <IT>Dan.</IT> 1.8. <IT>Tob.</IT> 1.11. and 1.<IT>Sam.</IT> 25.31.) and sometimes for <IT>ruine or de&rehy;struction</IT>, the fall of the whole person, which we are brought to by sinne, as <IT>Judith</IT> 5.20. our English renders it <IT>ruine</IT>, and <IT>Psal.</IT> 49.13. where though we read <IT>folly</IT>, the <IT>Septuagint</IT> <PB
N="3">read <IT>Scandall</IT>, by that rendring an Hebrew word which sig&rehy;nifies both <IT>folly</IT> and <IT>ruine</IT>. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="HBHB">lesev</FOREIGN></NOTE> I confesse this last acception of the word for <IT>ruine</IT>, is somewhat rare (yet authoriz'd by our English in the place of <IT>Judith</IT>) and therefore if any dislike it, I shall not stand much upon it: because in both those pla&rehy;ces last mentioned it may well enough signifie <IT>sin</IT>, as that is a <IT>snare</IT> or <IT>stumbling blocke</IT>, an occasion of ruine, or falling, or destruction, in which sense I conceive 'tis used, <IT>Judg.</IT>: 8.27. where 'tis rendred a <IT>snare, i.e. a sinne ensnaring or occasioning ruine</IT>.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 6.</NOTE> Beside these 3 significations, in which the word in Greeke retain'd in our language, is read in the old Testament, I am confident there is no other, save once <IT>Psal:</IT> 50.20. for <IT>slan&rehy;der or calumny or defamation</IT>, (for so the Hebrew <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="HBHB">ifd</FOREIGN></NOTE> there signi&rehy;fies) a sense which is vulgar amongst us in English; by a Scandall meaning a slander: but that sence being but once met with in the whole Bible, or twice at most (<IT>Eccl:</IT> 27.23. where yet I conceive the translation might be mended) will not deserve to be taken into consideration.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 7.</NOTE> Now for the use of the word in the new Testament: 'tis first observeable, that the best nomenclature for hard words in that is the observing the use of them in the Greeke of the old, for the writers of the new Testament, being Jewes not Greekes, wrote in an idiom proper and peculiar to them on&rehy;ly, and those other Jewes that wrote also in Greeke, some&rehy;what differing from that of the Atticke, or naturall Greeke writers. And therefore we may well resolve, that the uses of the word, which we have there found and already observ&rehy;ed, will be very instrumentall to the understanding of the same word, and others derived from it in the new Testament. And so much the rather because, as I said, no prophane Greeke writer before the scripture, is knowne to have used it; only <IT>Aristophanes</IT> once a word neare it. <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><CORR
SIC="skandal&emacr;thristas"><FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">skandal&emacr;thr&apos;histas</FOREIGN></CORR></NOTE> This being premised, 'twill be worth our paines (at least by so doing we shall put the whole matter beyond exception) to survey breifly all the places in the new Testament, where the word is used.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 8.</NOTE> To that end I shall beginne with the first in my Concor<PB
N="4">dance, which is <IT>Matt</IT>, 13.41. <IT>the Angells shall gather out all Scandalls</IT>: 'tis in a sence borrowed from the second mention&rehy;ed signification of a <IT>sharpe stake</IT>, which he who has once met with and beene gall'd by it, is wont to gather up and cast into the fire, as there it followes the Angels for our sakes should do, v: 24. (to which Saint <IT>Paul</IT> also seemes to allude 2 <IT>Cor:</IT> 11.29. in putting <IT>Scandalizing</IT> and <IT>burning</IT> together) and de&rehy;notes simply whatsoever may <IT>wound</IT> or <IT>gall</IT> us in our Christi&rehy;an course, and by that meanes <IT>foreslow</IT> our pace, cause us to <IT>slacken</IT>, or give over, or ly downe in the service of Christ, so <IT>Mat:</IT> 17.27. Christ paies tribute, that he may not <IT>offend the Jewes, i.e.</IT> that they might not thinke him a Contemner of the Temple, to which the Tribute was due, and so foresake and not beleeve in him; that he might not discourage them from following him. So <IT>Mat:</IT> 15.12. the Pharisees hearing a doc&rehy;trine that gall'd them particularly, were <IT>offended</IT> and for&rehy;sooke him, that doctrine drave them away from following him. So againe (<IT>Mat:</IT> 18.7.) <IT>it must needes be that offences come</IT>, which seemes to referre to <IT>false doctrines and heresies</IT>, if you compare that verse with 1.<IT>Cor:</IT> 11.19. <IT>there must be He&rehy;resies</IT> (and <IT>Rom:</IT> 16.17. where <IT>offences</IT> are said to be <IT>contrary to the Apostles Doctrine</IT>, and that they must be <IT>avoided</IT>, as the <IT>Hereticke</IT> must <IT>Tit:</IT> 3.10.) the venting of which of all things most <IT>hinders others</IT> in their Christian <IT>course</IT>, but whether it be meant peculiarly of Heresies or exemplary sins it matters not. To which soever you apply it, another place, <IT>Luk.</IT> 17.1. will belong unto it also, being the place directly parallell to it. So <IT>Matth.</IT> 18.6. <IT>He that shall offend one of these little ones. i.e.</IT> he that shall occasion their falling off into any sinne; or, which the place especially imports, by contemning them, discourage them from the study of piety. For so on the contrary side to <IT>receive them, v:</IT> 5. is by Saint <IT>Marke</IT> 9.41. exprest to consist in doing them kindnesse <IT>to encourage them</IT> in the wayes of godlinesse. So Christ crucified is said a Scandall to the Jewes, <IT>i.e.</IT> they that were otherwise not ill opinion'd of him, and so <IT>followed</IT> him with the multitudes, when they saw him cruci&rehy;fied, were quite discourag'd, and fell away from him, (as they <PB
N="5">that are so <IT>gall'd</IT> by those <IT>stakes</IT> are faine to give over the pur&rehy;suit, to return) and so resolved, seeing him dye, that he was not the <IT>Messias</IT> whom they expected, a glorious temporall deli&rehy;verer. To which belongs that noteable place <IT>Matthew</IT> 11.6. <IT>Luk:</IT> 7.23. <QUOTE
REND="it">Blessed is he that shall not be offended in me</QUOTE>, <IT>i.e.</IT> shall not be <IT>gall'd</IT> and discourag'd, and so fall off by seeing the sufferings that befall me, and await my disciples or followers. So againe <IT>Mat:</IT> 13.57. <IT>Mark:</IT> 6.3. It is said, that the consi&rehy;deration of his knowne and meane birth occasioned their be&rehy;ing <IT>offended in him, i.e.</IT> their deserting and not <IT>beleeving of him</IT>, when the miracles which he had done inclin'd them some&rehy;what to a valuing of him. So <IT>John</IT> 6.61. When Christ talkes of <IT>eating the flesh of the sonne of man, they were offended</IT>, (that is) that speech carnally understood (either that Christ was to dye, (which the eating his flesh presupposed, and they did not like to heare of; dreaming of a temporall glorious <IT>Messias</IT>) or that they were to turne <IT>Canniballs</IT> and <IT>eate mans flesh,) dis&rehy;courag'd</IT> them from <IT>following</IT> him, at least from taking him for the <IT>Messias</IT>. So <IT>Gal:</IT> 5.11. persecution is called the <IT>Scan&rehy;dall of the Crosse</IT>, or that upon which so many are discourag'd from professing the crucified Saviour, according to that in the parable of the sower, <IT>Mat:</IT> 13.21. <IT>Mark:</IT> 4.17. upon the comming of persecution <IT>presently he is offended, i.e. gall'd, and falles off</IT>, and <IT>Mat.</IT> 24.10. on the same occasion and in the same sence. So <IT>Mat.</IT> 26.31. <IT>Mark</IT> 14.27. <IT>this night</IT> (to wit of my attachement) <QUOTE><IT>Ye shall all be offended because of mee</IT>.</QUOTE> i.e. <IT>fall backe, forsake mee</IT>: and so in Saint <IT>Peters</IT> answer, <IT>v.</IT> 33. <QUOTE><IT>Although all men should be offended, yet will I never be offended</IT></QUOTE>: upon which, that which Christ rejoynes (<QUOTE><IT>before the Cocke crow</IT></QUOTE>; i.e. before morning, or day breake, all one with <IT>this night</IT>, <IT>v.</IT> 31. <QUOTE><IT>thou shalt deny mee thrice</IT></QUOTE>) is an interpretation of the word <IT>offended</IT>, and shewes, that to be <IT>offended</IT>, is to deny Christ. And so <IT>Joh.</IT> 16.1. <QUOTE><IT>These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended</IT></QUOTE>; where Christ foretels the perse&rehy;cutions that should befall them, that they might be forewarn'd too, and not fall off, when they befall them.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 9.</NOTE> These are the chief, if not all the places to which the second <PB
N="6">old Testament acception of the word <IT>Scandall</IT> in a Metapho&rehy;ricall borrowed sense belongs, and of all of them, and each, you may observe, <NOTE
TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 10.</NOTE> 1 That <IT>Scandall</IT> signifies either some <IT>sinne</IT>, the <IT>occasion of farther sinne</IT> in others; or else somewhat else, which though it be not sinne, yet occasions sinne in others, though very indirectly sometimes, as the Crosse of Christ: and whether in one or other, the rule will be, that he that is <IT>offended</IT> or <IT>Scandalized</IT>, doth directly commit some sinne, and that, for most of the places, the sinne of infidelity, or foresaking or denying Christ.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 11.</NOTE> 2. That the being <IT>Scandaliz'd</IT>, falling <IT>off from Christ</IT>, (or the effect which followes that occasion,) hath no reflection or influence (in any of the places) on that which was the oc&rehy;casion; so as to make it sinfull or avoydable, if it were not so before, (as will appeare to any that will survey the places) and consequently that anothers being Scandaliz'd is not sufficient to lay a charge on him, whose action (otherwise not chargeable or criminous) was the occasion of his being scandaliz'd. Let the Crosse of Christ, with which so many were in this sense, scandaliz'd, suffice for a proofe of this.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 12.</NOTE> Other places there are which must be interpreted by bring&rehy;ing the metaphore from the first of the 3 senses, as it signifies a <IT>snare</IT> or <IT>gin</IT> to catch one in. So <IT>Mat.</IT> 16.23. <QUOTE
REND="it">Thou art an offence unto me</QUOTE>, <IT>i.e.</IT> by expressing thy detestation against my sufferings, thou labourest to bring me into an horrour and feare of suffering, and so in effect temptest me to sinne; where you must marke, that though <IT>Peter</IT> were an offence to Christ, that is, <IT>tempted</IT> him, laboured to <IT>ensnare</IT> him, yet Christ was not <IT>Scandaliz'd</IT>, offended, ensnared, or overcome by the temp&rehy;tation. In the same sense is that <IT>Revel.</IT> 2.14. of <IT>Balaam</IT> who taught <IT>Balaack</IT> <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">balein skandalon</FOREIGN>, we render it <IT>to cast a stumbling block</IT>; but sure it is most clearely, <IT>to lay a snare</IT> be&rehy;fore the Children of Israell, to intice them by their Daughters to Idolatry, and by Idolatry to <IT>intrap</IT> and destroy them.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Lud de Dein.</NOTE> In this sence <IT>Scandall</IT> is so perfectly all one with Temptati&rehy;on, that, as a learned man hath observed, the Ethiopick inter&rehy;preter of the new Testament, instead of Scandall puts a word <PB
N="7">that signifies <IT>Temptation</IT>, and the same that in the Lords pray&rehy;er is put for <IT>Temptation</IT>: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="HBHB">twsnm</FOREIGN> <IT>from</IT> <FOREIGN
LANG="HBHB">hsn</FOREIGN></NOTE> in this sense is that of the <IT>eye</IT> and the <IT>foot offending</IT> us, <IT>Mat.</IT> 5.29.18.8. <IT>Mark:</IT> 9.47. i.e. when a mans eye, or any other member of his body proves a <IT>snare</IT> to him, an inlet to temptations, a meanes of bringing him to any sinne.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 14.</NOTE> And of those places you must observe againe. 1. That no man is said to be offended, but he that commits the sinne to which he is tempted, and therefore Christ is not said to be offended, that is, really to be wrought upon by that <IT>Scandall</IT>: but as Satan tempted him, <IT>Mat:</IT> 4. yet he yeilded not, but overcame the tempter: So here hee uses that other Satan: for to have beene <IT>offended</IT> in this sence had beene all one with being overcome by a <IT>temptation</IT>.</P>

REND="it" LANG="LAT">de facto</FOREIGN> appeare that they did) though no body be taken in it, as he that temp&rehy;teth to evill commits a sinne, though his temptation prove not effectuall. The setting of a snare being a positive act, a note of a treacherous designe, though it do not succeed. And there&rehy;fore in 1. <IT>Macchab.</IT> 1.36. the <IT>laying of snares</IT> for to intrap the Isrealites, or bring them from observing the Law, is call'd there by the devills name, <IT>an evill Adversary</IT>, or as the Greeke hath it, a <IT>devill to Israell</IT>. <NOTE

<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 16.</NOTE> A third and last sort of places there are that referre to the third mention'd acception of the word, as it signifies a <IT>stum&rehy;bling blocke</IT>, so when the word <IT>stone</IT> is joyned with it, or the Greeke word that signifies <IT>stumbling</IT>, <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">petra skandalou proskomma</FOREIGN></NOTE> so <IT>Rom.</IT> 9.33. Christ is called a <IT>stumbling block, and rocke of offence, i.e.</IT> an occasi&rehy;on of fall, or sinne in many, and consequently of increasing their condemnation, as he saith, <Q
REND="it">if he had not come, <RO>&amp;c.</RO> they had not had sinne,</Q> <IT>i.e.</IT> had not beene so great sinners, had not beene guilty of the great sinne of unbeleife, and crucifying of <IT>Christ</IT>: and therefore <IT>Simeon</IT> prophesies of <IT>Christ</IT>, that he would be for the <IT>fall of many in Israel</IT>; many sinnes his com&rehy;ming should be the occasion of. So <IT>Rom.</IT> 14.13. <IT>That no man lay a stumbling blocke, or scandall</IT> (which we render an <IT>occasi<PB
N="8">on of falling</IT>) in his <IT>brothers way</IT>, that is, do or practise any thing, that may bring another that comes after him, upon his nose, or to commit any sinne. So 1 <IT>Pet.</IT> 2.8. <IT>Christ is called a stone of stumbling, and rocke of offence</IT>, at which to stumble is to be <IT>disobedient to Christ</IT>. so <IT>Rom</IT> 14.21. <IT>stumbleth or is offended, or is made weake, i.e.</IT> by following thee, doth fall, commits some sinne, doth some act unlawfull <IT>for him</IT>, (though simply it were not <IT>for thee</IT>; it being against his Con&rehy;science, though not against thine) and so by <IT>falling</IT> bruises and <IT>weakens</IT> himselfe, makes himselfe lesse able for Gods service, then he was: for so every sinne against Conscience being a <IT>greiving the spirit</IT>, is consequently the spirituall weakening of the man, or if you will (as in S&tsup; <IT>James</IT> <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">asthenein</FOREIGN> signifies c.5.14) the wound or disease of the soule. So againe, 1 <IT>Cor.</IT> 8.9. <IT>stumbling block to the weake</IT>, and <IT>v.</IT> 13. where the case is clearely the same that we last mentioned: that if any man by doing any indifferent thing (which he in Conscience is inform'd to be perfectly lawfull for him to do) shall occasion another mans sinne by doing that after him which he is not resolv'd to be lawfull, that man offends against that charity due to his brother, and therefore must thinke fit to deny himselfe the use of that liberty which Christ has given him. To this may belong that other place, 1 <IT>Jo.</IT> 2.10. where that phrase (<IT>there is no Scandall in him</IT>) seemes to signifie, falls not into those sinnes that ignorant men or uncharitable (who are said in the Antithesis, <IT>v. 11. to walke in the darke</IT>) are subject unto. One place more there is belonging to this parpose, where though the word <IT>Scandall</IT> be not used in the Text, yet <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">proskop&emacr;</FOREIGN>, <IT>offence</IT>, is used, and that I confesse to be all one, and it is 2 <IT>Cor.</IT> 6.3. <IT>giving no offence in any thing</IT>; where yet offence is interpreted by <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Beza, quippiam ad quod possint impingere</FOREIGN>, <IT>any thing that o&rehy;thers may stumble at</IT>, or be alien'd from the Gospell by; as if we faile in any Christian duty (mentioned <IT>v.</IT> 4.5.6.) they that see us, would be apt to do: and so that which followes imports also (<IT>that the ministry be not blamed</IT>) that is, that our Actions be not justly reprehended or found fault with, <IT>but in all things approveing our selves</IT>. &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="9"><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 17.</NOTE> And of this third sort of places 'tis observeable againe, 1. that he that is <IT>offended</IT>, sinnes himselve, stumbles, and falls, and bruises himselfe, and 2. that he that is the occasion of his fall doth not alwayes sinne (for Christ, and grace, and <IT>that which should have beene for their wealth, proves to many an occasion of falling</IT>) but yet sometimes he doth: as if he purpose&rehy;ly in a matter <IT>indifferent</IT>, when he might have chosen, doth any thing which another whose Conscience is <IT>doubtfull</IT>, doth after him, and so <IT>sinnes</IT>; nay if he do not absteine from that indifferent action, when he sees that consequent <IT>likely</IT> to fol&rehy;low; nay if he be not carefull to observe, whether the conse&rehy;quent be <IT>likely</IT> to follow, and if so, to <IT>absteine</IT>.

And therefore the case being thus set of the commendable usefull indifferent, not of the meere frivolous unconsiderable, when the use and gaine of my action to me is <IT>certaine</IT>, and the dan&rehy;ger of being mistaken by others at most <IT>but possible</IT>, and that also preventable by these other meanes, neither piety nor prudence will advise to absteine from that healthfull food, which if it be by accident unhealthfull to others, hath yet an antidote administred with it.

LANG="GKGK">aition tou pseudous</FOREIGN>) the reason that men think it a fault to do any indifferent thing that another is <IT>angry</IT> or <IT>displeased</IT> at, is first the equivocallnesse of the English phrase <IT>to be offended</IT> for that in English signifies to be displeased: but in Greeke (the language wherein the new Testament is written) it sig&rehy;nifies no such matter, unlesse by accident, when <IT>being displeas&rehy;ed with Christ</IT>, makes a man <IT>deny him and forsake him</IT>: but then also 'tis not the being <IT>displeased</IT>, but the <IT>forsaking or denying him</IT> that is meant by being <IT>offended</IT>, that is <IT>Scandaliz'd</IT>.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 35.</NOTE> Or Secondly the use of a word that sounds like this in that notable chapter concerning Scandall <IT>Rom.</IT> 14. for there in<PB

I hope 'twill be much more just that that one single word should receive its importance from the whole context, then the whole context from that one word. The whole context from the 13. to the last verse belongs to the 3 sort of <IT>Scandall</IT> when a weak brother seeing me eate what is lawfull for me, because my Conscience is instructed, followes me, and eates too, though it be with a <IT>doubting</IT> or resisting Conscience, and so falls into sinne; as appeareth <IT>v.</IT> 14. <IT>to him that thinketh a thing uncleane or unlawfull, to him it is so</IT>, and therefore if he shall do it, he sinnes by so doing, and <IT>v.</IT> 23. <IT>he that doubteth is damned if he eate</IT>, and therefore in all probability that must be the meaning of the 10 verse also. [Is <IT>greived] i.e.</IT> wounded, or falls into sinne.] explained by 3 words <IT>v.</IT> 21. <IT>stumbling</IT> being <IT>offended</IT>, and being <IT>weake or sicke</IT>. And so it may easily be resolv'd to signifie. For secondly <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">lype</FOREIGN>, <IT>greife</IT>, may be taken for the <IT>cause</IT> of greife, a disease, or wound, or fall &amp;c. as <IT>feare</IT> in Scripture signifies <IT>danger</IT>, which is the cause of feare, ac&rehy;cording to a vulgar Hebraisme ordinary in the <IT>new Testament</IT>, where for want of the conjugation <IT>hiphil</IT>, which in Hebrew signifies [to make to do any thing] the Greeke is faine to use the active to <IT>do</IT>. An observation which <IT>Hugo Grotius</IT> makes use of to explaine that Phrase (I shall not enquire how truly) <IT>Mat.</IT> 19.9. and resolves that there <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">moichatai</FOREIGN> [committeth a&rehy;dultery] must signifie [maketh her from whom he divorceth to commit adultery] parallell to what we read, <IT>Mat.</IT> 5.23. So also <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">penthein</FOREIGN>, to <IT>bewaile</IT> 2 <IT>Cor.</IT> 12.21. signifies to punish, to use sharpenesse, which will cause greife, or wayling in them that suffer it.

<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 38.</NOTE> To all which I shall here insert this appendage, that even for proper-scripture-scandalls, the criminousnesse of them is not to be measured by the event, but by the naturall scanda&rehy;lousnesse, or aptnesse to give <IT>Scandalls</IT> inherent in them; for I conceive God passes Judgement upon sinners by intuition, not by prevision, by seeing what the sinne is in it selfe, and in the aggravating circumstances that are inseperable from it (as that it is apt to give scandalls &amp;c.) not by the casuall conse&rehy;quents that may possibly either follow or not follow. And I conceive, that that opinion of the Papists (on which they lay part of the foundation of their Purgatory) that men may after their Deaths sinne, and have more acts of sinne lying on them, (by reason of other men sinning by the scandall which they gave in their lifes) then they had at their Death, and so require in just recompence, some punishments increaseable above what they could be adjudg'd to at their death, is but a phansy or Schoole-notion, that hath some shew of truth, but little sub&rehy;stance, seeing God punisheth every man by the verdict of his owne Conscience; and therefore that other sinne, which my sinne is apt to produce in another, will be by way of aggrava&rehy;tion, layed to my charge by God, that sees my heart, and the inherent scandalousnesse of that action of mine, (though that other man by the grace of God do resist the Temptation which my Scandall gave him,) as much as if he had not resisted it, and so as his not sinning shall not excuse and lessen my fault which was apt to have brought him to sinne; so in like manner, if he do not resist the temptation, or if by occasion of it, he fall by accident (<IT>i.e.</IT> by the motion of some other part of his temper) <PB

That <IT>the great sinne of Scandall in the use of things</IT> indif&rehy;ferent, that Saint <IT>Paul</IT> so speakes of, and resolves against, <IT>Rom.</IT> 14. <IT>is the sinne of uncharitablenesse, or pride in despising and not condescending to the weake brother</IT>; meaning by the <IT>weake bro&rehy;ther</IT> not every one that may fall into any sinne (for so every one living will come under that title) but particularly him that is <FOREIGN
LANG="GKGK">asthen&emacr;s t&emacr;i pistei</FOREIGN>, weake and <IT>ignorant, and unsettled in the faith</IT>; as it is opposed to <IT>the strong, i.e.</IT> the <IT>knowing Christian</IT>.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 42.</NOTE> And then let any judge whether this can belong to them who professe themselves leaders of others, and would be <PB
N="29">unwilling to be counted ignorant, and particularly who in the points wherein they professe themselves to be offended, are so knowingly resolv'd, that they will never be induced to do that after me which they affirme themselves scandalized at: which you may discerne, because they are angry and inveigh against me for doing of it, and do not so much as pretend that they are by my example enclined to do what I do, and so <IT>scandalized</IT>; but only angry at me, or my <IT>Action</IT>, and so <IT>offended</IT>.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 43.</NOTE> Meane while I cannot but confesse that any mans willfull sinne, though it cannot be called weakenesse in our vulgar no&rehy;tion; yet in the other notion of <IT>weakenesse</IT>, for disease of soule, it may well passe; and deserve to be the object of my charity and compassion, as much or more then <IT>weakenesse</IT> is: and there&rehy;fore the uncharitablenesse of my brother or his causles anger a&rehy;gainst me being such, I conceive myselfe bound to use any law&rehy;full meanes which I can hope may be able to prevent any such sinne in him, or to get or recover him out of it; especially if that sinne of his may become probably over and above his un&rehy;charitablenesse, a meanes to stoppe or hinder him in his course of reformation, or farther growth in piety; as probably it will be, if I against whom he is thus unjustly wrath, <corr sic="be">he</corr> is lawfull Pa&rehy;stor; for then that causlesse anger or rage of his against me may, through his farther default, occasion in him some vow or re&rehy;solution, never to heare me, never to be moved or perswaded by me in any thing, that out of the Pulpit or in private reason&rehy;ing or exhortation, I shall (never so convincingly) propose unto him.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 44.</NOTE> In this case it may be demanded whether I ought in charity to absteine from this indifferent action, which I foresee will be the matter, though not the cause of all this sinne in him, of uncharitablenesse and non-proficiency in his Christian course, and whether if I do not so absteine, this be not to <IT>scandalize</IT> my brother? To which I breifly answer, 1 That this anger or uncharitablenesse of his, is not the being scandaliz'd in the scripture sence, nor consequently in that respect my Action a Scandall, though it be the matter of the anger, or that which he is angry with.</P>
<PB N="30"><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 45.</NOTE> Secondly, 'Tis true indeed that his revolving against my preaching, is in him to be <IT>Scandaliz'd, i.e.</IT> to fall and be stopt in the service of God: but this only in a generall sense; as eve&rehy;ry other such hard-hearted obdurate resisting of Gods grace is, or may be called also: and that which occasions this being <IT>Scandaliz'd</IT>, is not my indifferent action, but his anger or un&rehy;charitable conceit of me for it, unlesse &aelig;quivocally, or remote&rehy;ly, as my action is the object of that anger, which anger is the Author of that profane resolution.
</P><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 46.</NOTE> Yet Thirdly, if I might foresee that my indifferent action would occasion, though unjustly, his anger, and his anger pro&rehy;duce the effect before mentioned, I thinke I should do well to absteine from that indifferent action, in charity to him.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 47.</NOTE> But that with these cautions, 1. Unlesse my indifferent acti&rehy;on be ordinable to some good Christian use, and designed by me to it; for then, as the Jewes resolve that a tree set for fruit though it chance to be worship't, is not made unlawfull by that meanes, so that indifferent <IT>usefull</IT> action of mine will not be made unlawfull by the possibility of that ill consequent: <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO"><IT>Maimon: <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de Idol:</FOREIGN> c.</IT> 5.</NOTE> Or secondly unlesse that action in it selfe indifferent, by lawfull authority be commanded, and so cease to be indifferent to me who am under that authority: Or thirdly, unlesse my abstein&rehy;ing may as probably prove matter of anger to some other of contrary perswasions: Or fourthly, unlesse that my absteining, or receding, or undoing what before I had done, be more likely to confirme him in his errour (which otherwise in time being not yeilded to, he may foresake) then to prevent or allay his causlesse anger and those effects of it. Or fifthly, unlesse I use some meanes in prudence not only sufficient, but probable to prevent this sinne of unjust anger in him before, or to re&rehy;forme it afterward.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 48.</NOTE> But if my absteining be like to fall into all or any of these inconveniences, then sure I ought not thus to absteine; because when these consequences do attend my absteining, they are nearer and more immediate to my absteining, then his resolv&rehy;ing against my preaching, is to my doing of it.</P>
<PB N="31"><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 49.</NOTE> And another consideration also may be taken, that he that will so causlessely be angry and resolve against the ordinary meanes of his salvation, will by the suggestion of the Devill or temptation of his owne corrupt humour, be likely to finde out some other matter of quarrell against me and my preach&rehy;ing. <IT>i.e.</IT> against his owne salvation, though I by absteining from that particular action, deprive him of that.
</P><P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 50.</NOTE> And lastly, though I shall not define, yet I would have it con&rehy;sidered, whether he that is so disposed in soule and affection, that so gives up the raines of his passions, as upon every or no occasion to breake out into causlesse anger, uncharitablenesse, and the effects of it forementioned, be at all the more innocent or lesse culpable in the sight of God by the not committing of some one act of that sinne, only through wanting that or any other one occasion of committing that act. For as in good things God accepts the will for the deed (if it be a firme and ratified will, a full actuall intention, & want nothing but oppor&rehy;tunity to shew it selfe) & againe accepts him that hath exprest that will by ten only acts, being by want of opportunity <CORR
SIC="depri&rehy;ed">deprived</CORR> of a possibility of adding one act more to the number, as&rehy;well as him, which having the opportunity that the other wanted, hath exceeded him in the number of outward acts. So there may be some reason to feare, that an unresisted, unre&rehy;strained propension or consent to evill, that wants nothing, but an occasion to actuate it, will be as criminous in the sight of God, as if (without any improvement or change, but only by meeting with that occasion) it breake forth into act: or that an habituall inclination to sinne in one man ten times actua&rehy;ted in the members, having no more occasions to actuate it, shall be as sadly punished, as the same degree of inclination and intention through presence of occasion once more actu&rehy;ated.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 51.</NOTE> The same Consideration will be proper to other particulars incident to the matter of Scandall. As when any thirsty drunkard actually importunate in the pursuite of his espous&rehy;ed sinne, shall by occasion of my feast fall into an open act of that sinne, (and a hundred the like.) The question then may <PB
N="32">be, whether supposing him bent to excesse, and not only ha&rehy;bitually guilty of it, but actually Intent upon it, and only kept off by want of Occasion, He would have had lesse guilt upon his soule, if I had not then invited him. I conceive it hard to maintaine the affirmative, for though with men, who see not the heart, no sinne is punishable but that in the members (un&rehy;lesse in case of Treason) yet with God the sinne of the heart and the hand seemes to be equally great, the act of the mind and the act of the body; And the minutely preparations of that to sinne as punishable, as the minutely execution of this. As in the Schoolemens resemblance the pressing of the stone to the ground is as great when it is with-held by my hand, as when it is actually moving toward the center.</P>
<P><NOTE TYPE="structure" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">&sect; 52.</NOTE> I confesse there is somewhat to be said, and perhaps with probability, on the other side. And I thinke Saint <IT>Augustine</IT> somewhere expresseth his opinion, that though in good things God mercifully accepts the will for the deede, yet out of the same mercy and indulgence he punisheth <IT>not so</IT> in evill things; Yet because Saint <IT>Augustine</IT> may perhaps meane the incom&rehy;pleate and not perfect act of the will, (which though we yeild to be lesse then the outward act, yet the compleate act of the will, wanting nothing but opportunity of execution, may still be as great,) Or however, because there are not such de&rehy;monstrable grounds of resolution, as to yeild cleare convicti&rehy;on to all in this matter, and too assure the Christian that such an Addition of any outward act of sinne shall make the punish&rehy;ment the heavier to the habituall sinner, and so the absence of that outward act alleviate it; therefore, although I said I thinke he should do well to absteine, I dare not yet affirme that he is bound in charity to do so; Nothing but charity binding him to it, and the man that still hath that propension unresist&rehy;ed, being (upon this supposition, which we have made not improbable) like to reape little profit from that charity.</P>
