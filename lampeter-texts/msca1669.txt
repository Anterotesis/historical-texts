<SALUTE><RO>May it please your <SC>Majesty</SC></RO>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic;N my Voyage from <RO>Malta</RO> to this place, wherein I have
used all the diligence the season hath given me leave, I touched at the
City of <RO>Catania</RO> in <RO>Sicily</RO>, and was there most kindly
Invited by the Bishop to lodge <PB N="4">in his Palace, which I
accepted, that so I might be the better able to inform Your Majesty of
that extraordinary Fire, which comes from Mount <RO>Gibel 15</RO> miles
distant from that City; which for its horrid&rehy;ness in the aspect,
for the vast quantity thereof, (for it is <RO>15</RO> miles in length,
and <RO>7</RO> in breadth) for its monstrous devasta&rehy;tion, and
quick progress, may be termed an Inundation of Fire, a Floud of Fire,
Cin&rehy;ders and burning Stones, burning with that Rage as to advance
into the Sea <RO>600</RO> yards, and that to a mile in breadth, which I
saw; and that which did augment my admiration was, to see in the Sea
this matter like ragged rocks, burning in four fathom water, two fathom
higher then the Sea it self, some parts liquid and mo&rehy;ving, and
throwing off, not without great violence, the stones about it, which
like a crust of a vast bigness, and red hot, fell <PB N="5">into the
Sea every moment, in some place or other, causing a great and horrible
noise, smoak and hissing in the Sea; and thus more and more coming after
it, making a firm foundation in the Sea it self. I stayed there from
nine a Clock on Saturday morning, to seven next morning, and this
Mountain of Fire and Stones, with Cinders, had advanced into the Sea
<RO>20</RO> yards at least, in several places; in the middle of this
Fire, which burn'd in the Sea, it hath formed a passage like to a River,
with its Banks on each side very steep and craggy, and in this Channel
moves the greatest quantity of this Fire, which is the most liquid, with
Stones of the same composition, and Cinders all red hot, swimming upon
the fire of a great magni&rehy;tude; from this River of Fire doth pro&rehy;ceed
under the great Masse of the Stones which are generally three fathom
high all <PB N="6">over the Country, where it burns and in other places
much more, there are secret Conduits or Rivulets of this liquid mat&rehy;ter,
which Communicates Fire and heat into all parts more or less, and melts
the Stones and Cinder by fits in those places where it toucheth them,
over and over a&rehy;gain; where it meets with Rocks or Houses of the
same matter (as many are) they melt and go away with the Fire; where
they find other compositions they turn them to lime or ashes, (as I am
in&rehy;formed.) The composition of this Fire, Stones and Cinders, are
Sulphur, Nitre, Quick-silver, Sal-Armoniac, Lead, Iron, Brass, and all
other Mettals. It moves not regularly, nor constantly down hill; in some
places it hath made the Valleys Hills, and the Hills that are not high
are now Valleys. When it was night I went upon two Towers in divers
places, and <PB N="7">could plainly see at <RO>10</RO> miles distance,
as we judged, the Fire to begin to run from the Mountain in a direct
line, the flame to ascend as high and as big as one of the highest and
greatest Steeples in Your Ma&rehy;jesties Kingdoms, and to throw up
great Stones into the Air; I could discern the River of Fire to descend
the Mountain of a terrible fiery or red colour, and stones of a paler
Red, to swim thereon, and to be, some as big as an ordinary Table. We
could see this fire to move in several other places, and all the Country
covered with Fire, ascending with great Flames, in many places, smoaking
like to a violent furnace of Iron melted, making a noise with the great
pieces that fell, especially those which fell into the Sea. A Cavalier
of <RO>Malta</RO>, who lives there, and attended me, told me, that the
River was as liquid where it issues out of the Mountain, as <PB N="8">water,
and came out like a Torrent with great violence, and is five or six
fathom deep, and as broad, and that no stones do sink therein. I assure
Your Majesty, no Pen can express how terrible it is, nor can all the Art
and Industry of the world quench, or divert that which is burning in the
Country. In <RO>40</RO> dayes time it hath destroyed the habitations of
<RO>27</RO> thousand persons, made two Hills of one, <RO>1000</RO> pa&rehy;ces
high, a piece, and one is four miles in compass, as Your Majesty will
see by the draught that I take the boldness to send herewith; it was the
best I could get, but hath nothing of the Progress into the Sea; the
confusion was so great in the City, which is almost surrounded with Moun&rehy;tains
of Fire, that I could not get any to draw one, but I have taken care to
have one sent after me for Your Majesty. Of <RO>20000</RO> persons
which inhabited <RO>Cata<PB N="9">nia, 3000</RO> did only remain; all
their Goods are carried away, the Cannons of Brass are removed out of
the Castle, some great Bells taken down, the City-Gates Walled up next
the Fire, and preparation made all to abandon the City.
</P>
<P>That Night which I lay there, it Rained Ashes all over the City, and
Ten Miles at Sea it troubled my Eyes. This <RO>Fire</RO> in its
Progress met with a <RO>Lake</RO> of four Miles in compass, and it was
not only satisfied to fill it up, though it was four fathom deep, but
hath made of it a <RO>Mountain</RO>.</P>

<P>&Mic;<IT>Ount &AElig;tna</IT>, or <IT>Monte Gibello</IT>, a Moun&rehy;tain
so Renowned throughout the World for its height and greatness, but much
more for those Prodigious Flames, Smoak, and Ashes which it hath cast
out from the top of it, whilst the other parts are continually (even in
the midst of Summer) cover'd with Snow, has been for many Ages observ'd
once, or sometimes oftner, in the space <PB N="12">of about fifteen
years, to throw up more than ordinary Flames, with much Smoak and
Stones, and great quantities of Ashes, which (though terrible to the
neighbouring Towns and Villa&rehy;ges) was yet wont, in little time, to
abate of its fury, and prove but seldom more injurous to the Countrey
near it, than by communicating large&rehy;ly its ashes, which though for
the present it did somewhat incommode them, they had after&rehy;wards a
considerable Compensation in the pro&rehy;duct of their Lands, which by
this means were render'd more fruitful.
</P>
<P>But on Friday the <IT>18/8&thsup;</IT> of <IT>March</IT> 1669. the
Sun was observed before its setting to appear of a pale and dead colour,
which (being con&rehy;trary to what it ever before appeared to
<UNCLEAR>us</UNCLEAR>) struck no small terror into the inhabitants, all
Objects appearing also of the same colour, with a paleness received from
that of the Sun. The same night happened in this City as well as the
whole Countrey hereabouts, a terrible and unusual Earthquake, whose
strong and une&rehy;qual motions, joyned with horrible Roarings from
<IT>Monte Gibello</IT> exceedingly frighted the Inhabitants, but was so
extraordinarily violent in the Countrey adjacent, that the people were
<PB N="13">forced to abandon their houses and to fly into the Fields to
avoid the danger threatned them from the falling of their houses. The
Village of <IT>Nicolosi</IT> was of all others the most dreadful&rehy;ly
handled by this furious Earthquake, the houses and other buildings being
shaken all in pieces, and buried in their own Ruines; the poor People
(who had preserved their lives by a timely flight, with such little of
their Goods as their hasty fears would permit them to carry out with
them) continued a night or two in the fields, beholding with grief and
astonishment the ruine of their habitations: but observing that by these
violent concussions, the Earth began to open in several places, and to
threaten them with inevitable ruine, they fled, though with much trouble
and amazement to this City. These shakings of the Earth being so
frequent and violent, that the People went reeling and staggering, with
much difficulty supporting one another from falling, in so much as what
with their want of sleep, the pains they were forced to take in
travelling, and the great terrors im&rehy;printed on them by what they
had seen and suf&rehy;fered, they appeared at their arrival in this City
as so many distracted People, wholly insensible of what they did.</P>
<PB N="14">
<P>This dreadful convulsion of the Earth was immediately followed on
Monday <IT>March</IT> 11. about 10 at night by 3 terrible Eruptions,
much about the same time, and at little distance one from the other.
</P>
<P>These said Eruptions were observed to be on the side of <IT>Monte
Gibello</IT>, about 2 miles beyond the Mountain called <IT>Montpileri</IT>,
from whence with a terrible noise it threw up its flames with much fury
and violence about a hundred yards in height, its noise not roaring only
in&rehy;wards from the belly of the Mountain as be&rehy;fore, but
violently cracking like peales of Ord&rehy;nance or thunder, from the
side of it throwing out vast stones, some of them of 300 pound weight,
which being (as it were) shot through the air, fell several miles
distant from the place, whilst the whole air was filled with smoak,
burning Cinders, and ashes, which fell like a fiery rain upon the
Country.</P>
<P>In the mean time issued from the side of this Prodigious Mountain a
vast Torrent of Melt&rehy;ed and burning Matter, which, like an Inunda&rehy;tion,
Drowned, as in a Flood of Fire, the Countrey on this side of it.</P>
<P>This Burning River ran down upon the <PB N="15">Mountain <IT>Monpileri</IT>,
which, opposing its direct course, it divided it self into two Streames,
which encompassed the said Mountain; one of them taking its way by <IT>La
Guardia</IT>, the <IT>Convent</IT> of St. <IT>Anne</IT>, and <IT>Malpasso</IT>,
the other by the Towns of <CORR SIC="onpileri"><IT>Monpileri</IT></CORR>,
and <IT>Falicchi</IT>, which in few hours were wholly destroyed and
lost, not so much as any sign of them remaining, with se&rehy;veral
lesser Villages and Farmes, and with them the Famous <IT>Image</IT> of
the blessed Lady of the <IT>Annunciata</IT>; which, though highly Re&rehy;verenced
throughout the whole <IT>Island</IT>, esteem&rehy;ed the Wonder of
<IT>Sicily</IT> and the whole World, and to which the People with much
Devotion resorted in Pilgrimage from the remotest parts, was also
swallowed up and consumed by this dreadful Torrent.</P>
<P>This Fiery and burning Deluge immediate&rehy;ly spread it self to
above six mile in breadth, seeming to be somewhat of the colour of melt&rehy;ed
and burning Glass; but, as it cooles, be&rehy;comes hard and Rocky, and
every where in its passage leaves Hills and Pyramids of that Matter
behind it.</P>
<P>At the same time <IT>Monte Gibello</IT> from its top ra&rehy;ged
with dreadful Flames, which with its Noise <PB N="16">and Concussions
of the Earth still continuing, added not a little to the Terror of the
People, who ran with Cries and Lamentations about the City and Country,
expecting nothing but to be swallowed up, or consumed by Fire, ha&rehy;ving
no other apprehensions but of Death, and a General Conflagration.</P>
<P>The two Torrents of Fire forward, de&rehy;stroying all things in
their way, and by Wed&rehy;nesday, <IT>March</IT> 13th, had on the West
side branched it self into several Streams, and over&rehy;ran <IT>Campo
Rotundo</IT>, St. <IT>Pietro</IT>, and <IT>Mostorbian&rehy;co</IT>,
with <IT>La Potielli</IT>, and St. <IT>Antonino</IT>; and on the East
part ruin'd the lower part of <IT>Masca&rehy;lucia</IT>, and <IT>Le
Placchi</IT>, taking its way towards this City.</P>
<P>On <IT>Thursday</IT> the 14th, the Wind came East&rehy;wards, on
which day fell abundance of Rain, which abated not the progress of the
Fire; which on the East side had from <IT>Mascalucia</IT> made its way
to St. <IT>Giovanni di Galermo</IT>, the lower part whereof it
destroy'd; and passing on seem'd to <sic corr="threaten">threatned</sic> this City on one side, as
did that on the West-side the other.</P>
<P>As the Fire approached the Religious every where appeared with much
Devotion, carrying <PB N="17">in Procession their Reliques, especially
those of <IT>St. Agatha</IT>, the famous Martyr of <IT>Catania</IT>,
in which they reposed no small confidence, fol&rehy;lowed by great
Multitudes of People, some of them Mortifying themselves with Whips, and
other signes of Penance, with great Com&rehy;plaints and Cryes,
expressing their dreadful ex&rehy;pectation of the Events of those
Prodigious Fiery Inundations.</P>
<P>Whil'st the People were thus busied in their Devotions, and
astonisht by their Feares, News was brought to the Magistrates of the
City, that a considerable number of Thieves and Robbers had taken the
opportunity of this ge&rehy;neral Distraction, to make a Prey of the
already distressed People, and that they had Murdered several of them
for their Goods; and that it was to be fear'd, that the City of <IT>Catania</IT>
it self might run some danger from the great numbers of them which were
about the Country, and from thence took their opportunities to get into
the Town. Whereupon, consultation being had for the prevention of
farther mischief from them, the Commander of the Castle was Or&rehy;dered
with a considerable number of Horse, and a Party of <IT>Spaniards</IT>,
to secure the Country <PB N="18">and City against these Robbers; who
imme&rehy;diately sent out several Parties with his provost&rehy;Marshall,
with Order to seize on all suspected Persons, and such as were not able
to give a good account of themselves: and, for such as were taken in the
Fact robbing, to Execute them by Martial-Law, without any farther Tryal,
and accordingly caused three pair of Gallowes to be set up for their
speedy Execu&rehy;tion; one before the Gate <IT>Di Aci</IT>, a second
in the <IT>Market-place</IT>, and a third before the Gate <IT>Della
Decima</IT>, setting strong Guards upon the Gates of the City, and
causing all suspected Houses to be searched, and Account to be given in
of all Lodgers, and such persons to be secu&rehy;red, as could any wayes
fall under a Suspiti&rehy;on.</P>
<P>The poor People out of the Country being by this Prodigious Calamity
stript out of all their Estates, and reduced to great extremity, fled
most of them for refuge and reliefe to this City, with great
Lamentations moving the Charity of the Magistrates, which was readily
inclined to give them the best assistance they were able; and the
Citizens, moved by their Complaints and Sufferings, freely open'd their
<FW TYPE="catch">Doores</FW> <PB N="19">Doors, filling their Houses
with as many of those distressed People, as they could possibly receive;
the Bishop, and all persons of Quality and Estate contributing largely
for their sup&rehy;port, till better Order could be taken for the
disposing of them.</P>
<P>The City of <IT>Messina</IT> also, and several other Cities
(informed of this extraordinary Cala&rehy;mity) sent Hither large
Supplies of Provisi&rehy;ons, offering their best assistance to this
place, in case of extremity.</P>
<P>All the Elements seemed at this time to make War upon us, and to
conspire together for the punishment of the Inhabitants: The Ayre was
continually darkened with Clouds and Smoke, agitated by great and
violent Winds, and often&rehy;times showred down great Raines, insomuch
as the Sun from the begining of these Eruptions, very seldome appeared
to us, and when it did, (with extraordinary paleness,) for a little time
only, and (as it were, abhorring so dreadful a Spectacle) soon hid its
face again under a thick Cloud.</P>
<P>The Sea ran much higher than it was wont to do, and by its
extraordinary Roaring, and in some places over-flowing its Bankes, added
<PB N="20">not a little to our consternation. The Land eve&rehy;ry
where infested with Thieves, insomuch, that till by the extraordinary
care taken by the Magistrates and Officers, severe execution was done
upon such as were apprehended in the Fact, no person was able to stirr
abroad without danger of his life; whilst the Fire by this prodigious
overflowing of the Mountain, threatned to take possession of all.</P>
<P>On Friday the 15th. the stream of fiery Matter which destroyed the
lower part of <IT>St. Giovanni di Galermo</IT> divided it self into two
parts, one of its branches taking its way to&rehy;ward <IT>Mosterbianco</IT>,
the other threatning the City of <IT>Catania</IT>, but this last was
observed to move with more slowness then before, ha&rehy;ving in 24
hours time scarcely gained one mile.</P>
<P>On the 18th being Monday, the Torrents being still seen to draw
nearer and nearer to this City, the Senate with Monsegnior <IT>Cam&rehy;buchi</IT>
the Bishop of this place, followed by all the Clergy Secular and
Regular, and an infi&rehy;nite number of people went in a solemn Pro&rehy;cession
out of this City to <IT>Monte de St. Sofia</IT>, carrying out with
greatest Devotion their <PB N="21">choicest Relicks, and upon an Altar
erected in view of the Mountain, exposed them, where they celebrated
Mass and used the Exorcismes accustomed upon such extraordinary occasi&rehy;ons,
all which time, the Mountain ceased not as before with excessive roaring
to throw up its smoak and flames with extraordinary vio&rehy;lence, and
abundance of great stones, which were carried through the Air, some of
them falling within their view, though at ten miles distance from the
Eruption; the Ashes which proceeded from thence were scattered in great
abundance, as well on this City as on the Countrey adjacent, every where
in the Fields with Cinders, and the heat of the said Ashes destroying
the Grass, which obliged the people to drive away their Cattle to a
farther distance, which would otherwise have perish&rehy;ed for want of
food.</P>
<P>These streams of ruine daily crept neerer and neerer to this City,
but by uneven and irregular motions, according as it was more or less
supply'd from its fountain; but on Wednesday the 20th we perceived that
that branch of it which seem&rehy;ed most to threaten this City from
<IT>St. Giovanni di Galermo</IT> was wholly extinguisht, and the o<PB
N="22">ther which bent its course towards <IT>Moster-bi&rehy;anco</IT>
ran but slowly and gave us some hopes that its fury was also near spent,
but the other Torent which had before overflown <IT>Mosterbian&rehy;co</IT>,
continued its motion with as much violence as ever, being in breadth
above a Musquet shot over; but in probability could not easily over&rehy;flow
to the Westwards which was defended by its Rocky scituation; another
branch which ran by <IT>Santo Pietro</IT> was observed to be much
larger then the rest, and its stream more quick and active, but meeting
with some op&rehy;position in its way, it made some stop, one&rehy;ly
sending out a Rivolet toward the East&rehy;wards about three or four
yards wide, of its most subtle and active matter, which direct&rehy;ed
its course towards a small Village about a furlong distant from its main
stream; another Branch threatned <IT>Campo Rotundo</IT>, but bent its
course westwards towards the Farme of <IT>Val&rehy;corrente</IT>, where
its Fiery body was scattered into several deep and rocky places, without
any considerable damage.</P>
<P>About this time we had hopes that the vio&rehy;lence of this
eruption had been over, the Mountain not throwing out its flames with
<PB N="23">that violence as before, and its noise and roar&rehy;ing in
a great measure ceased.</P>
<P>Those who at nearest distance took a view of the Mountain, informed,
that the top of it, was fallen in, and the Mountain supposed to want
near a mile of its former height; that the largest of the Mouths from
whence these Fiery streams were vented, was about halfe a mile in
compass, but the view of this dreadful inundation carried so much terror
in it as they were not able to express; from all these Mouths were
vomited Rivers of a thick and fiery substance of stone and Metals
melted, whose depth was various according to the se&rehy;veral places it
filled in its passage, in some places 4, in others 8, 12 or 15 yards and
up&rehy;wards; its breadth in some places 6 miles, in others much more;
its flame like that of Brim&rehy;stone, and its motion like that of
Quicksilver; advancing ordinarily very slowly, unless where it was
provoked by the addition of a fresh Torrent or some considerable
descent. Where&rehy;soever it passed, it left large heaps of its con&rehy;gealed
matter, with which it covered and burnt the earth, melting the walls of
Castles and Houses, throwing down and consuming all <PB N="24">before
it, nothing being yet found able to resist its force, nor any thing able
to quench its burning, water being observed rather to add to its fury;
wheresoever it has passed, it has left its dreadful marks behind it,
levelling some hills and raising others, so much chan&rehy;ging the
scituation, that not the least trace of any place or Town remains,
nothing being to be seen but confused heaps of ragged stone, which
yielding a noisome fume, strikes terror and astonishment into all that
behold it.</P>
<P>On Friday the 22, the Mountain again roar&rehy;ed with much
loudness, and threw up from its Mouths a vast quantity of matter, which
form&rehy;ed two large hills higher and larger then that of <IT>Monpilori</IT>,
with a large bank of the same matter to the Eastwards, sending down a vi&rehy;olent
stream of its liquid matter towards <IT>Mal&rehy;passo</IT>, much
enlarging the former Current, and passing thence to <IT>Campo Rotundo</IT>
and <IT>Santo Pi&rehy;etro</IT> compleated the ruines of those Towns,
driving furiously towards <IT>Moster-bianco</IT>; the other stream by
<IT>Santo Giovanni de Galermo</IT> be&rehy;ing wholly diverted and
extinguisht.</P>
<P>From this time till the 25th, the Mountain continued silent, but
then it burst out again <PB N="25">with more force than ever before,
its noise much louder, like Peales of Ordnance, and so forcible and
lasting, as for 24 houres it caused a shaking and trembling in our
Buildings, the Ayre so filled with Smoak and Ashes, as dark&rehy;ned the
Face of the Sky.</P>
<P>The Birds and Fowle about this time, either through want of Food, or
illness of Ayre, which was corrupted with the noysome smells arising
from these Burnings, were observed to lye dead in all places.</P>
<P>On the 28th. the Grand Current was advan&rehy;ced near the City as
far as the old <IT>Capucins</IT>, which struck so great a Terror into
the People, that most of them left the City, only some Of&rehy;ficers
remaining with such persons as were un&rehy;der their command, who have
secured and sent away the <IT>Magazine</IT> and all the Artillery from
the Castle.</P></BODY></TEXT>

<HEAD><IT>A Later</IT> Relation <IT>from</IT> Catania, <IT>bearing
Date the 27th of</IT> April, <IT>gives us this farther Account</IT>:
viz.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;He Dreadful Inundation from <IT>Monte Gi&rehy;bello</IT>
having destroyed many <IT>Castles</IT> and <IT>Towns</IT>, with an
infinite loss, and utter ruine to the Inhabitants, arrived lately with a
renewed Force at <IT>Mostor-bianco</IT>, which it has whol&rehy;ly
ruin'd; from thence passing on to <IT>Alba&rehy;nelli</IT>, in four
Dayes space destroyed all the Gardens and Vineyards, with 63 Thousand
Vines.
</P>
<P>On <IT>Wednesday, April</IT> 16. With an Impetu&rehy;ous Fiery
Torrent it came towards <IT>Sardanello</IT>, where all the remainder of
the Inhabitants of this City were Spectators of it, which resembled
<PB N="27">a River of melted and burning Brass, about ten Ells wide,
running with swiftness to the Arch of <IT>Marcus Marcellus</IT>, a
Famous Piece of Antiqui&rehy;ty, and passing under it ruin'd about 6
Ells of it, which was the breadth of the Current in that place: from
thence it ran to <IT>Madonna di Monserrato</IT>, which it wholly
destroyed: then falling down to <IT>Madonna delle Gratie</IT>, it
entred in at one Gate, and passed through another, without any
considerable hurt, and running through the Gate <IT>Della Decima</IT>,
filled all the Plaine <IT>Di Schiara Viva</IT>, where it was above six
Ells deep. Then taking its way towards the Bulwark, on the Sea-side,
under the Castle of this City, it ran by, two Ells deep into the Sea; in
which, (to the great wonder of all that saw it) it has made its Progress
a mile in length, and as much in breadth, and is drawing towards the
Gate of the Channel, which gives us great Appre&rehy;hensions, least it
may that way Invade the City it self: Nor is there less Danger on the
side <IT>Del Tindaro</IT>, where there runs a great Torrent of the same
Active matter, which drawes near, and seemes to threaten <PB N="28">the
Walls, and is in that place about a mile in breadth, having over-flowed
and de&rehy;stroyed all the Gardens, from the Gate <IT>Della Decima</IT>,
as farr as <IT>Madonna delli A&rehy;mellati</IT>.&horbar; &horbar;</P></BODY></TEXT></GROUP>
