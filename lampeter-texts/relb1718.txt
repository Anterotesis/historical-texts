<HEAD>THE <BO>PREFACE</BO> TO THE <SC>Author</SC> of the <GO>Flying-Post</GO>.</HEAD>
<SALUTE><IT>SIR</IT>,</SALUTE>
<P>&Iic; Was very agreeably surpriz'd, to see my Letter not only Publish'd, when I began to despair of you in Candour in that Point) but vouchsafed a particular An&rehy;swer: nor was the Satisfaction I took therein at all abated by the Sneer in your Title-Page, where you are pleas'd to call me the <IT>Colchester Amazon</IT>; for if I must pass for an <IT>Hyppolyta</IT>, I have the Vanity to think you are not the <IT>Her&rehy;cules</IT>, that shall lead me in Triumph.
</P><P>Had I known you to be a married Man, I should have directed my Letter to your Wife; for not only the Argument; but the Stile, <PB
N="iv">and foul Language with which your News&rehy;Paper abounds, smell much of a Woman: And whatever your Sentiments may be, I be&rehy;lieve most People will be of Opinion, that had your Wife or your self been instructed under Dr. <IT>Snape</IT> at <IT>Eaton</IT>, you would have learn'd better Sense and better Manners, than it appears you at present enjoy. That nei&rehy;ther of you were bred up in his Parish, I shall not at all question, but very readily take your Word for it; because to the best of my Remembrance, the Doctor's Parish is some&rehy;what remote from <IT>Billingsgate</IT>.</P>
<P>Why you should fancy me to be only an <IT>Amanuensis</IT>, I cannot imagine. The Reasons you give, are the Stile, Spelling, and Poin&rehy;ting of my Letter. Do you then think it im&rehy;possible for a Woman to Spell true, and Point a Sentence right? I hope you will not look on all the Sex with such Contempt: And as to the Style, which seems the only valid Rea&rehy;son; it is easily answer'd by a bare Mention of the Names of <IT>Sappho</IT>, Mrs. <IT>Behn</IT>, the Famous Queen <IT>Elizabeth</IT>, and other Females, who have excell'd in the Polite Parts of Lear&rehy;ning. My Mother was excellently well skill'd in the <IT>Latin</IT> Tongue, and not wholly igno&rehy;rant of the <IT>Greek</IT>; and I have the Vanity to think the Education she bestow'd on me, not thrown away; since my Style in the Judgment even of so severe an Adversary as your self, <PB
N="v">looks not much unlike that of the <IT>Reverend Dr.</IT> Bennet.
</P><P>I now proceed to Answer your <IT>civil Questi&rehy;ons</IT>, pag 7. and to the first I reply; that the sole Motive of my engaging in this Dispute, was a Love of Truth, and a just Indignation at that savage Treatment of the Doctor, by your <IT>pretended Correspondent</IT>. So that in An&rehy;swer to your second Question, I must tell you, that it is not because the Vigour of our <IT>Male&rehy;Champions</IT> is exhausted, that I have underta&rehy;ken to carry on the Controversy: But to let you know, that your senseless Calumnies are so far from having any Influence in the World, that even the <IT>Female Sex</IT> can see through your Sophistry, and detect your Fallacies.</P>
<P>If you expect, as the Third Question seems to imply, that Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT> should himself answer you: I beg leave to tell you, that you are foolishly Fond of your own Writings, and blinded with Self-Conceit; else you might rationally infer, that a Divine of his Station in the Church, has better Employment on his Hands, than to throw his Time away in an&rehy;swering every <IT>impertinent News-Writing Scandal-Monger</IT>. It was a great Piece of Con&rehy;descension in the Doctor, to vouchsafe to an&rehy;swer the first Letter you troubled him with; but if you expect you should meet with the same Regard, every Time that you are pleas'd to be starting trifling Objections and Cavils, <PB
N="vi">under the <IT>Pretence</IT> of receiving Letters on that Head from your <IT>Correspondents</IT>; I believe you feed your self with vain Hopes, and will deservedly be overlook'd with Contempt.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, in Answer to your last Question, I declare, that I am <IT>no Substitute of the Doctor's</IT>, nor have any farther Knowledge of him, than by his excellent Writings: As also, that I am no Person's <IT>Amanuensis</IT>; that the Hand and Argument are <IT>not more a Wo&rehy;man's</IT>, than the Style, Spelling and Pointing, which you think smell more of the <IT>Ferula</IT>, than the <IT>Distaff</IT>. As to the Contempt, you throw on the Argument, I shall leave every impartial Reader, after the Perusal of this, to judge for himself, whether it have really so much of a Woman in it; or whether on the contrary, it be not more probable, that, <IT>not&rehy;withstanding your Pretence</IT>, your Wife has answer'd me <IT>in Earnest</IT>.</P>
<P>I would now willingly pass to the Point in Controversy between us; but since you have been pleas'd to tell the World of a <IT>second railing Letter</IT> of mine, and endeavour'd to fix on me the Imputation of being a Scold; I am oblig'd not to conclude the Preface, till I have vindicated my self from the Ca&rehy;lumny.</P>
<P>I believe had you publish'd that <IT>second Letter</IT>, there are few would have found any <IT>Railing</IT> in it; for to tell a Person an unwel<PB
N="vii">come Truth in modest Terms is far from be&rehy;ing so. This Sir, is all I have done: I have applied the Text of Scripture in the Title&rehy;Page of my Book, <IT>to that more effectual Me&rehy;thod of propagating Scandal, than the Tongue, your Licentious Pen</IT>: I also told you, that <IT>Calumny was your Talent; that neither the Dead, nor the Living, Bishops, nor Kings, could escape your severest Censure</IT>. These, Sir, as unwelcome as they may be, are neverthe&rehy;less Truths; and tho' it may seem needless to prove them such to any, that has been your Reader for a Month; yet I shall make good the Charge, from the Book now before me, which is, by the by, one of the <IT>modestest</IT> of your Performances.</P>
<P>And here I pass over your Sneer on Dr. <IT>Snape</IT> in the beginning of your Answer; (tho' it might be justly expos'd, as foreign to the Purpose, forced, and ridiculous;) and pass to <IT>pag.</IT> 14. where you insinuate a Compari&rehy;son between the present worthy <IT>Metropolitan</IT>, and the <IT>Convocation</IT>, and the <IT>High-Priest and Sanhedrin</IT> of the <IT>Jews</IT> in our <IT>Saviour's</IT> Time; by which you would make the World be&rehy;lieve, <IT>that they rest in outside Performances, have made void the Law of God by their Ce&rehy;remonies and Traditions, and persecute such, as refuse absolute Submission to those Tradi&rehy;tions</IT>. This, as it is the first, so is it a very <PB
N="viii">flagrant Instance of the Truth of my Charge against you.</P>
<P>The Second is <IT>Pag.</IT> 17. much of the same Nature with the First; only to Calumny, you have there added a perverting the Scrip&rehy;ture: For in the Text by you quoted from St. <IT>John</IT>, our <IT>Saviour</IT> evidently speaks of the <IT>Excommunication</IT> of his own <IT>Disciples</IT> by the unbelieving <IT>Jews</IT>. There is not one Word of the <IT>Christian Clergy following their Exam&rehy;ple</IT>; and I challenge you to prove, that they are so much as hinted at.</P>
<P>Your Accusation of Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT>, for mis&rehy;quoting the Bishop of <IT>Bangor</IT> comes next, in which Mr. <IT>Sykes</IT> has since been your <IT>Second</IT>; believing therefore that the Doctor himself will answer him, I shall wave the Point, and desire you to wait till then for Satisfaction. Only I am apt to think, that it will at last be prov'd, (as it has once already, in relation to his quoting the Bishop's Words about our <IT>Sa&rehy;viour's Example</IT>) that, what he has left out, does not at all after the Sense of the Proposi&rehy;tion.</P>
<P>The next Calumny is <IT>Pag.</IT> 28. where you affirm, <q rend=it>That the High-Church Clergy, such as Archbishop <ro>Laud,</ro> Dr. <ro>Sibthorp,</ro>and Dr. <ro>Manwaring,</ro> in conjunction with their Bre&rehy;thren the Papists, did quite subvert our Consti&rehy;tution, and so far influence King <ro>Charles</ro> the First, that he turn'd our limited Monarchy into <PB
N="ix">a despotical Tyranny</q>. Here we have that <IT>Blessed Martyr, King</IT> Charles, branded by you with the Name of <IT>Tyrant</IT>; and the excel&rehy;lent Archbishop <IT>Laud</IT> stil'd a <IT>Brother to the Papists</IT>, and <IT>Subverter of the Constitution</IT>. But while the admirable Works of the <IT>Royal Martyr</IT>, and the Learned <IT>Conference</IT> of the good <IT>Archbishop</IT> with <IT>Fisher</IT> the <IT>Jesuit</IT>, are in every ones Hands; your Folly will be hiss'd at for venting itself in such senseless Calum&rehy;nies. There all may see how far the <IT>King</IT> condescended to the <IT>despotical Tyranny</IT> of his <IT>rebellious Subjects</IT>; how he gave away all, till he left himself defenceless; and would have complied with any Terms, which he could, without wounding his Conscience, grant: There they may behold the <IT>Prelate</IT> with great Judgment and Learning, triumphing over the Church of <IT>Rome</IT>, and establishing the <IT>Protestant Faith</IT> on <IT>Scripture, Reason</IT>, and the <IT>Fathers</IT>.</P>
<P>The <IT>Witnesses</IT> you have appeal'd to, I am a little surpriz'd at, for if any one read the Characters of the <IT>King and Archbishop</IT>, in my <IT>Lord</IT> Clarendon's <IT>History</IT>, he will find the very contrary to what you have affirm'd. Mr. <IT>Nelson</IT> is entirely against you; and if no more than his <IT>Preface</IT> be consulted, that will be sufficient to invalidate the Testimony of your <IT>last Witness Rushworth</IT>; whom he plain&rehy;ly demonstrates to be partial and unjust.</P>
<PB N="x"><P>I observe, that you have referred us to no Page in any of these Books, as conscious of the Falseness of your Calumny; but have barely nam'd them, and left us to turn over ten or twelve <IT>Folio's</IT>, and <IT>look for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay</IT>.
</P><P>In the next Page you say, the <IT>Dissenters</IT> were not guilty of the <IT>King's Murther</IT>; for the Proof of the contrary, I refer to the <IT>Scourge</IT>, N&o.sup; I. which being very common, I shall not surfeit the World with needless Re&rehy;petitions. The Words you quote from the 30th <IT>Act of the 12th of</IT> Charles I. are so far from being of any Service to you, that they expresly confute you. The Murder is there charg'd on <IT>Fanatick Miscreants</IT>: And I need not tell you, that <IT>Fanatick</IT> is a Synonimous Word for <IT>Dissenter</IT>. As to it's being said, <IT>they were as far from being true Protestants, as true Subjects</IT>; you may remember, that it has long been the Opinion of wise Men, that the <IT>Dissenters, the Pretended only Protestants</IT>, are secretly carrying on the Cause of the <IT>Church of</IT> Rome; and <IT>Faithful Comin</IT> is not the sole Instance of a <IT>Jesuitical Schismatick</IT>.</P>
<P>That the <IT>Presbyterians</IT> restor'd the <IT>King</IT> and <IT>Monarchy</IT> is equally false; and the Pas&rehy;sage in the <IT>King's Speech</IT> is <IT>very impertinently</IT> introduc'd to prove it: For there is not one Word about the <IT>Dissenters</IT> in it.</P>
<PB N="xi"><P>I cannot but wonder at your Confidence, when you tell us, <IT>Pag.</IT> 34. That a <IT>Church of</IT> England <IT>Parliament</IT> pull'd down the <IT>Church of</IT> England <IT>Hierarchy</IT>. Do you think, Sir, that all the World are grown Fools, that you would fobb so senseless a Lie upon us? Is not this the same, as if a Man should affirm, that the <IT>Pope</IT> in the Reign of <IT>Henry</IT> VIII. brought about the <IT>Reformation</IT>, and overturn'd the <IT>Papal Supremacy</IT>? I dare say, the one will as soon be believ'd, and may as easily be prov'd, as the other.
</P><P>With the <IT>same Air of Truth</IT>, you in the same Page assert, that the <IT>High-Church Party</IT> sacrific'd the <IT>Doctrine</IT> of the <IT>Church</IT> to <IT>Arminia&rehy;nism</IT> and <IT>Popery</IT>, and their so much admir'd <IT>Government</IT> and <IT>Discipline</IT>, to a <IT>Pope</IT> at <IT>Lam&rehy;beth</IT>, with a Train of <IT>Inquisitors</IT>, call'd a <IT>Court of High Commission</IT>. Here is another Insult on the Ashes of the <IT>Excellent Archbishop Laud</IT>: The Charge of <IT>Popery</IT>, I have already prov'd false; as to that of <IT>Arminianism</IT>, if by it be meant the <IT>Remonstrant Notions</IT> in the <IT>Quiquarticular Controversy</IT>; as the <IT>Archbishop</IT> gloried in maintaining it all his Life; so <IT>we</IT> glory in it to this Day.</P>
<P>The <IT>Articles of the Church of</IT> England, are very express in Favour of it, particularly that of <IT>Predestination</IT>, which the <IT>Learned Dr.</IT> Ben&rehy;net has prov'd to be, as to every Propositon, fully contain'd in the <IT>Writings of</IT> Arminius: <PB
N="xii">The <IT>Holy Scriptures</IT>, almost in every Page, confirm <IT>this Doctrine</IT>; and the <IT>Writings</IT> of all the <IT>Fathers</IT> of the <IT>four first Centuries</IT>, abundantly establish it. The contrary Do&rehy;ctrines, are the <IT>Stoical Notions of Fate new Vampt, the old Heresy of the</IT> Gnosticks <IT>reviv'd</IT>; and except the Name of the <IT>Great Austin</IT>, had recommended them to some inconsiderate Persons, they would long ago have been more universally exploded. The <IT>Supralapsarian Scheme</IT> of <IT>Calvin</IT> and <IT>Twisse</IT>, and the <IT>Sub&rehy;lapsarian</IT> of our <IT>Moderns</IT> is as monstrous a Do&rehy;ctrine, as contradictory to <IT>Scripture</IT> and <IT>Rea&rehy;son</IT>, as the <IT>Popish Transubstantiation</IT>; and he that has embraced the <IT>Former</IT>, is well pre&rehy;par'd to swallow <IT>the Latter</IT>. I defie you or any Man, to prove the <IT>Contra-Remonstrant Doctrines</IT> not to be contradictory to the whole Tenour of <IT>Scripture</IT>, destructive of all Virtue and Piety, derogatory to <IT>God's Justice, Truth, Mercy, and Goodness</IT>, and <IT>Blasphemous</IT> in the highest Degree.</P>
<P>When you say, <IT>Pag.</IT> 36. That the <IT>Dissen&rehy;ters</IT> in <IT>King</IT> Charles <IT>the First's</IT> Reign, were oblig'd to do what they did, in <IT>mere Self-De&rehy;fence</IT>, against the <IT>High-Church Party</IT>, who treated them with <IT>Cruelty almost equal to that of the Inquisition</IT>; I hope you do not expect to be believ'd, till you specifie what that <IT>Cruelty</IT> was, and by <IT>whom</IT> it was <IT>they</IT> were thus inhumanly treated. This, I am assur'd, <PB
N="xiii">you will never be able to do; your <IT>Scandal</IT> lies in <IT>Universals</IT>, and you are not able to de&rehy;fend any one <IT>particular</IT> Point of it.</P>
<P>The present <IT>Clergy</IT> fall next under your Lash, as <IT>Enemies to the Establishment in Church and State, ever since the Revolution</IT>. This is a <IT>Stale</IT> Piece of Slander, worn quite thread&rehy;bare, and so often answer'd already, that all I shall say to it, is, that you have the <IT>true Spirit</IT> of the rest of the <IT>Whigs</IT> in you, and tho' an Objection be ever so often and so solidly confuted, can continue it <IT>with the same Con&rehy;fidence and Assurance</IT>, as if not a Word had been replied to it. This is a Method used by many <IT>Dissenters</IT>, and meets with too much Success among the <IT>Populace</IT>.</P>
<P>Your last Attack is on <IT>Her late Majesty of Blessed Memory</IT>; whom you charge with ma&rehy;king a <IT>treacherous and inglorious Peace</IT>, the Intent of which, was to Sacrifice <IT>the three Nations</IT>, with all the <IT>Protestant Interest</IT> in the <IT>World</IT>, to <IT>Popery</IT> and <IT>Tyranny</IT>. This <IT>impu&rehy;dent Forgery</IT> there are few now alive, but can from their own Memory and Knowledge con&rehy;fute; and that is a sufficient Excuse for me to forbear enlarging on this Head. For I have not so much of <IT>Tommy Burnet</IT> in me, as to write <IT>merely to acquaint the World, with what they know already better than my self</IT>.</P>
<P>I am tired with raking in this Heap of Scandal; but as you cannot deny, that you <PB
N="xiv">have forced me to it, that will I hope (<IT>at least with you</IT>) be a sufficient Apology for me. And now having fully prov'd my Charge a&rehy;gainst you, I beg leave to repeat part of my <IT>second Letter</IT>, and once more tell you; <IT>that be the Cause you are engaged in, ever so just, it is but a Scurvy Trick to get a Habit of Ly&rehy;ing for the Truth</IT>. Whether you think <IT>Party&rehy;Zeal</IT> will justify you in such <IT>scandalous Pro&rehy;ceedings</IT>, I shall not take on me to Judge; but leave you to <IT>God</IT> and your own <IT>Conscience</IT>.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have done with the <IT>Pre&rehy;face</IT>, and shall proceed to the <IT>Answer</IT>, which you say, you are pleas'd to make to my Letter, <IT>because</IT> Solomon <IT>advises us to answer some People, lest they be wise in their own Conceit</IT>; that is, <IT>to answer a Fool according to his Folly</IT>. Thus do you <IT>very civilly</IT> call me, or rather the <IT>Colchester</IT> Doctor, whose <IT>Ama&rehy;nuensis</IT> you take me to be, <IT>a Fool</IT>: Pardon me, if I return not the <IT>Compliment</IT>; because <IT>Solomon</IT> in the preceding Verse advises us, <IT>not to answer a Fool according to his Folly, lest we also be like unto him</IT>. I shall therefore in the following Tract address my self to the <IT>candid and impartial Reader</IT>, and conclude my <IT>Pre&rehy;face to you</IT>, with subscribing my self,</P>

<HEAD>THE FLYING-POST POSTED, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></HEAD>
<P>&Aic;FTER a <IT>dull</IT> Piece of <IT>Insipid</IT> Railery, which I have in the <IT>Preface</IT> consider'd, the <IT>Author of the Flying-Post</IT> begins his Argument, with an Accusation of me for not having read my Lord of <IT>Bangor</IT> with sufficient Attention; by which means he thinks I have mistaken the State of the Question. The <IT>Religion</IT> in Debate, it seems, is not now any other, than the <IT>Christian Religion alone</IT>, as revealed in the <IT>New Testament</IT>: Though it was thought by the Generality, that the Dispute had been about <IT>Religion in general</IT>. If I have indeed mistaken my Lord of <IT>Bangor's</IT> Meaning, I am not the only Per&rehy;son by many Hundreds, that have been ob&rehy;noxious to this Mistake. Neither shall I have much Cause to blush, if <IT>affected Obscurity</IT>, <PB
N="2">and a <IT>studied Darkness</IT> have been too thick for a <IT>Female Eye</IT> to pierce through.
</P><P>However I shall (as others have been forc'd to do in this Controversy already) trace him through this <IT>other Meaning</IT>; and prove, that by this Change of the Point in Dispute, he has been so far from gaining any thing, that he has only brought himself to a <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Ne plus ultra</FOREIGN>, where it is <IT>impossible</IT> for him to avoid owning his Meaning, and as <IT>impossible</IT> to de&rehy;fend it. This will be sufficiently perform'd, by proving, that even in the <IT>Christian Religi&rehy;on</IT>; as reveal'd in the <IT>New-Testament</IT>, the Hopes and Fears of another World, are not the <IT>only</IT> Motives, that render our Actions <IT>Re&rehy;ligious</IT>.</P>
<P>But before I enter on the Proof of this, I think it proper to vindicate my Instances of the <IT>Jews, Ninevites</IT> and <IT>Sadducees</IT>, from the <IT>strange</IT> Misrepresentations of the <IT>Author of the Flying-Post</IT>.</P>
<P>He in a <IT>preposterous</IT> manner chuses to begin with the End of my Letter, and take my last Instance first; and because he shall not ac&rehy;cuse me of beginning with the End of his Answer, I shall for once comply with him so far, as to follow that Order.</P>
<P>In his <IT>ninth Page</IT> he says, that the <IT>Ninevites</IT> believed and repented upon what <IT>God</IT> had revealed to them by the Mouth of <IT>Jonas</IT>; and that the natural Inference from this is, <PB
N="3">that <IT>Christians</IT> must also believe as much as they are taught. Now if it be once made evident, (as I shall fully prove it is in the Se&rehy;quel of this Discourse,) that <IT>Christians</IT> have the Motives of Joy and Misery in this World, <IT>as well as in the next</IT>, propos'd to excite them to Obedience; this Argument will prove, that <IT>Christians</IT>, who say, the Hopes and Fears of another World are the <IT>sole</IT> Prin&rehy;ciple, from whence <IT>Religious</IT> Actions flow, do not believe as much as they are taught, and consequently are not so truly <IT>Religious</IT> as the <IT>Ninevites</IT>.</P>
<P>But, says the <IT>Pamphleteer</IT>, Pag. 10. It does not appear from the Text, that the <IT>Ninevites</IT> were not afraid of losing their Souls, as well as their Bodies and Houses. But, pray, does it appear that they were? If not, let the <IT>Si&rehy;lence</IT> of the <IT>Scripture</IT> in that particular, be a sufficient Proof, that it is a <IT>meer Chim&aelig;ra of his own Brain</IT>. In such Points, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Idem est non esse & non apparere</FOREIGN>: Where there is no Text to prove a Notion, that <IT>negative Argument</IT> is a full Confutation of it; though no <IT>positive</IT> Words of <IT>Scripture</IT> can be produc'd, that ex&rehy;presly deny it. There is no Text of <IT>Scripture</IT>, which says in express Words, that there is no <IT>Purgatory</IT>; yet all <IT>Protestants</IT> think that ridi&rehy;culous Notion abundantly refuted by the <IT>Si&rehy;lence of Scripture</IT> on that Head, and the Insuffi&rehy;ciency of those Texts alledg'd by the <IT>Papists</IT> to prove it.</P>
<PB N="4"><P>Besides, all this <IT>Scribler</IT> aims at, is, to shew a <IT>bare Possibility</IT> of the <IT>Ninevites</IT> belie&rehy;ving a Future State. I shall therefore put him in Mind of an <IT>old Metaphysical Maxim; <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">A Posse ad Esse non valet Argumentum</FOREIGN></IT>: That is, <IT>in plain English</IT>, an Argument drawn from the <IT>Possibility</IT> of a Thing's Existence to its <IT>actual</IT> Existence, is inconclusive. What is more ridiculous, than to argue thus? It is possible that <IT>London</IT> may be burnt down to Morrow? Therefore it will be actually burnt down. It is possible, that the <IT>Thames</IT> may overflow, and drown the City; therefore it does so. What can be more absurd and nau&rehy;seous than this? Yet of this Kind are the <IT>tri&rehy;fling Cavils</IT> of this <IT>paultry Scribler</IT>.
</P><P>But at last he has found an Argument, which he triumphs in, and which, he thinks, proves, that they actually believed a Future State: And that is, that <IT>Nineveh</IT> was founded by <IT>Noah's immediate Posterity</IT>; who being a <IT>Preacher of Righteousness</IT>, we have Reason to believe, taught <IT>his Posterity</IT> the same <IT>Faith</IT> he entertain'd himself. <IT>Ah! Unhappy Sophister!</IT> Was there no Argument but this; which if it prove any thing, will equally prove, that <IT>no Man ever</IT> disbelieved a Future State? Are not <IT>all Mankind equally</IT> descended from <IT>Noah</IT>? If their being <IT>his Posterity</IT> proves, that they retain the <IT>same Faith</IT>, which he entertain'd; how comes it, that there are so many hundred <PB
N="5"><IT>Heresies</IT> in the World; so many <IT>Sects</IT> and <IT>Parties</IT>, divided from, and contradictory to each other? Were not the <IT>Sadducees</IT> descen&rehy;ded from <IT>Noah</IT>? Are not all the <IT>Infidels</IT>, that ever lived since the <IT>Flood</IT>, his <IT>Posterity</IT>? Wherein then lies the Force of this Argu&rehy;ment? But perhaps, as a certain <IT>Free-Thinker</IT> has found out <IT>Men before the Flood not descen&rehy;ded from</IT> Adam, so you may have made a Discovery of <IT>Men after the Flood not descended from</IT> Noah.</P>
<P>To do you Justice, Sir, I must own, that the Stress of your Argument lies in their being <IT>Noah's immediate Posterity</IT>; by which you insinuate, that the <IT>Tradition</IT> of his <IT>Faith</IT>, could not be so soon wholly obliterated. To this I reply, that it still remains to be proved, that that <IT>Tradition</IT> in succeeding Generations was preserved uncorrupted, even till the Time of <IT>Jonas</IT>. The contrary may with great Reason be inferr'd from the Fate of that <IT>Tradi&rehy;tion</IT>, even in the <IT>Posterity of Shem</IT>, the Father of <IT>Ashur</IT>, Founder of <IT>Nineveh</IT>; whom for his eminent Vertue and Piety, some <IT>mistaken Commentators</IT> will needs have to be <IT>Melchise&rehy;dech</IT>, King of <IT>Salem</IT>. Now we find in the ninth Generation from him, his <IT>Posterity</IT> had so far deviated from the <IT>Faith</IT>, that they not only disbelieved a Future State; but were igno&rehy;rant of the <IT>True God</IT>, and followed <IT>Idols</IT>: Insomuch that when <IT>God</IT> reveal'd himself to <PB
N="6"><IT>Abraham</IT>, he call'd him out from his <IT>Idolatrous Country</IT> and <IT>Kindred</IT>, and separated him from the Danger of being infected by their Conta&rehy;gion. Was not <IT>Nimrod</IT> the great Grandson of <IT>Noah</IT>, the <IT>Head</IT> of that <IT>Rebellious Crew</IT>, who in Defiance of the <IT>Almighty</IT>, projected the building a <IT>Tower</IT> whose Top might reach to Heaven; thereby thinking to secure themselves from the Danger of <IT>another Flood in this World</IT>, which if they could effect, they stood in no Awe of <IT>any Flames in the next</IT>? Where now was <IT>this uncorrupted Tra&rehy;dition</IT>? What, quite lost and eras'd in the <IT>third Generation</IT> from <IT>Noah</IT>? How can it then be thought probable, that it should de&rehy;scend pure and entire to <IT>so distant an Age</IT>, as that in which the <IT>Prophet Jonas</IT> liv'd? Even after the giving of the <IT>Law</IT>, we find the <IT>Scriptures</IT> of the <IT>Old Testament</IT>, tho' in the Hands of the <IT>Sadducees</IT> did not secure them from the Disbelief of a Future State: And where a <IT>written Rule of Faith</IT> has fail'd, how much more insufficient will <IT>a Traditional one</IT> be?</P>
<P>This may serve also for an Answer to your Argument, <IT>Pag.</IT> 16. where you conclude from <IT>Job's</IT> Belief of a Future State, that it cannot be prov'd the <IT>Ninevites</IT> disbelieved it. For tho' it were ever so evident, that the Do&rehy;ctrine of a Future State was preserved pure and entire in the Days of <IT>Job</IT>, who lived, as <PB
N="7">all agree, before the giving of the Law; that is no Proof, that it descended in the same Pu&rehy;rity to the <IT>Co-Temporaries of Jonas</IT>, who lived so long after the <IT>Law</IT>.</P>
<P>I might have objected, that divers of the <IT>best Commentators</IT>, particularly <IT>Grotius</IT> and <IT>Patrick</IT>, are of Opinion, that the Words of <IT>Job</IT>, Ch. xix.25, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> refer only to that full Assurance he enjoyed of a Deliverance from his present Affliction, and the loathsome Dis&rehy;ease, which he then labour'd under. But I am not willing to enter into a needless Dis&rehy;pute: And since the <IT>Church of England</IT> in her <IT>Burial Office</IT> has applied this <IT>Text</IT> to a Future State, I <IT>humbly submit</IT> my <IT>private Judgment</IT> to <IT>her wise</IT> Determination, and to the excel&rehy;lent Reasons of the admirable Bishop <IT>Pearson</IT>.</P>
<P>If the Experience of modern Travellers as&rehy;sures us, that the <IT>most barbarous</IT> Nations in <IT>Asia</IT> now believe another World, that is nothing to the Purpose; for that proceeds from the <IT>Promulgation</IT> of <IT>Christianity</IT>; some Remains of which, the Learned Dr. <IT>Jenkin</IT>, in his admirable Treatise of the <IT>Excellence</IT> and <IT>Rea&rehy;sonableness</IT> of the <IT>Christian Religion</IT>, has large&rehy;ly proved to be still preserved in a Multitude of Nations, where the <IT>Substance</IT> is clouded and lost in <IT>Superstition and Infidelity</IT>.</P>
<P>I come now to his Answer to my Argument from the <IT>Sadducees</IT>, in which tho' he has <PB
N="8">been <IT>very large</IT>, I shall be <IT>somewhat brief</IT>, because all he has said is little to the Purpose.</P>
<P>The Question put to him, on this Head, in my Letter, was; <IT>Whether they, who be&rehy;liev'd not a Future State, as the</IT> Sadducees <IT>did not, upon Supposition of the Truth of the</IT> Bishop of <IT>Bangor's</IT> Notion, <IT>have any Obligation to Acts of</IT> Religion? This he complains, <IT>P.</IT> 26. is so <IT>ambiguously worded</IT>, that he cannot easily fathom my Meaning. I protest, <IT>I cannot fathom his</IT>; when in order to prove them so, he would interpret them, whether they could <IT>think</IT> themselves oblig'd to Acts of Religion? Is there one Syllable in my Question about <IT>their Thoughts</IT>? Is it not ask'd in express Words, whether they <IT>have</IT> any Obligation to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>; not whether <IT>they think they have or not</IT>? Where then is there any <IT>Ambi&rehy;guity</IT>, but of his own Inventing? The Truth is, he finds himself press'd with the Strength of the Argument, and to evade a Reply, pre&rehy;tends it <IT>Ambiguous</IT>: Yet in the <IT>same Paragraph</IT> he <IT>unluckily</IT> stumbles on the true Meaning of the Question; but not being able to answer it, he proves at large a Thing foreign to the Purpose, <IT>viz. That the</IT> Sadducees <IT>were</IT> a wicked Generation of Vipers, <IT>and denied</IT> the Resurrection. The contrary to this, No&rehy;Body ever maintain'd; I shall therefore pass over his <IT>impertinent</IT> Digressions on that Head.</P>
<PB N="9"><P>The Question is not what the <IT>Sadducces</IT> were; but what they were obliged to be: Not what <IT>Acts of Religion</IT> they did perform; but whe&rehy;ther it does not follow from the <IT>Bishop of</IT> Bangor's <IT>Notion</IT>, that they have no Obligati&rehy;on to perform any? And whether his Notion be not <IT>therefore</IT> Erroneous?
</P><P>That from the <IT>Bishop's Notion</IT>, it necessa&rehy;rily follows, that they were oblig'd to <IT>no Acts of Religion</IT>, I thus prove: No Man is oblig'd by God, to do that, which is impossible: Now, if, as the <IT>Bishop</IT> says, the Belief of ano&rehy;ther World is the <IT>only</IT> Principle, that can ren&rehy;der an Action <IT>Religious</IT>; then to them who believe not a World to come, the doing a <IT>re&rehy;ligious Act</IT> is <IT>impossible</IT>; because they want that Principle from whence <IT>alone, Religious Actions flow</IT>; and consequently can no more perform them, than a Bird can fly without those Wings, which <IT>Alone</IT> enable it to soar from the Earth: Therefore to these <IT>impossible Acts of Religion</IT>, they who disbelieve a Fu&rehy;ture State, are not oblig'd. I have here set down the Result of the <IT>Bishop's Notion</IT>: That of Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT> on the contrary, (which makes the <IT>Fear</IT> of <IT>God</IT>, whether it have Regard to this or the other World; Love and Gratitude for our Being and Preservation, and all his Temporal Mercies; Principles, from which <IT>Religious Actions may flow</IT>;) lays on the <IT>Sad<PB
N="10">ducees</IT> indispensible Obligations to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>: whereas they, according to <IT>my Lord of</IT> Bangor's <IT>Doctrine</IT>, can be accountable for nothing, but their <IT>bare Disbelief</IT> of a <IT>Resur&rehy;rection</IT>; not for those <IT>Religious Acts</IT>, which to Men so persuaded, <IT>himself</IT> affirms to be <IT>impos&rehy;sible</IT>: And I suppose, <IT>he</IT> is not ignorant of that <IT>universally received Maxim</IT> of the <IT>Casuists, <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Impossibilium nulla est Obligatio</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>In the twelfth Page, something of an Ar&rehy;gument is offer'd at, which I would consider, if the Texts quoted mention'd any thing of the <IT>Sadducees</IT>: But I can find nothing in the whole <IT>first Epistle to the</IT> Corinthians, that re&rehy;lates to them. If it be objected, that tho' the <IT>Persons</IT> disputed against <IT>in the 15th Chapter of that Epistle</IT>, are not the <IT>Sadducees</IT>; yet the <IT>Error</IT> there treated of, is the same with that <IT>they</IT> maintain'd and therefore, that the Argu&rehy;ment is still conclusive: I answer, that <IT>Mr. or Mrs.</IT> R&horfill;d&horfill;th, (for whether I am disputing with the Gentleman, or his Wife, the Weak&rehy;ness of the Argument gives me Cause enough to doubt,) quotes these Texts, to prove, that the <IT>Sadducees</IT> could not <IT>think</IT> themselves oblig'd to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>; whereas, if he would confute me, he should quote some&rehy;thing, which proves them <IT>actually</IT> under no Obligation to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>. I do not think my self oblig'd, when he flies from the Point <PB
N="11">in Dispute, to follow him to other Topicks, nothing at all to the Purpose.</P>
<P>From the Belief of another World being by St. <IT>Paul</IT> accounted the <IT>chief</IT> Hope of a <IT>Christian</IT>, he would infer, that Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT> contradicts St. <IT>Paul</IT>; and then asks, whom I will believe. Truly, Sir, St. <IT>Paul</IT>; if he indeed contradicts the <IT>Doctor</IT>. But I desire you to remember, that the <IT>Doctor</IT> does not <IT>exclude</IT> the Belief of another World from <IT>Religion</IT>, nor deny it to be the <IT>chief</IT> Hope of <IT>Christians</IT>; but affirms it not to be the <IT>Sole</IT> Principle, from whence <IT>Religious Actions flow</IT>: And that St. <IT>Paul</IT> himself affirms the same, I shall in its proper Place demonstrate. In the mean Time, I shall end this Point, with in&rehy;forming you, that tho' the <IT>Faith</IT> of <IT>Christians</IT> in a Future State be, if there be no such State, <IT>as to that Point</IT>, vain; it does not from thence follow, that there are no Promi&rehy;ses in the <IT>Gospel</IT>, but what relate to a Future State; which was the Thing you ought to have proved.</P>
<P>In his Collection from <IT>Josephus, Drusius</IT> and <IT>Scaliger</IT>, my Adversary contradicts him&rehy;self, and gives up the Cause, by owning, that the <IT>Sadducees</IT> observed the <IT>Law</IT>, (that is, did such <IT>Religious</IT> Acts as the <IT>Law</IT> enjoyns) to enjoy the <IT>Temporal</IT> Blessings it promis'd, and to escape the Punishments denounced to its <PB
N="12">Transgressors. Here we have <IT>Religious Actions</IT> flowing from the Hopes and Fears of <IT>this World</IT>, and <IT>himself</IT> confuted by <IT>himself</IT>.</P>
<P>Another Instance of Self-Contradiction in him, is <IT>Pag.</IT> 10. where he, in answer to my Question about the <IT>Sadducees (I suppose igno&rehy;rantly</IT>) owns, that their not believing another World, could not dispense with their Obliga&rehy;tions to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>. Here he confesses what Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT> and I have asserted, and leaves <IT>my Lord of Bangor</IT> in the Lurch. And yet, poor forgetful Man, he after writes three Pages to prove the contrary. There is an <IT>old Proverb</IT> about the Necessity of some Persons having a good Memory, which I wish he had given me no Reason for the Applicati&rehy;on of to himself.</P>
<P>Having said a great deal to prove the <IT>Sad&rehy;ducees</IT> did not think themselves oblig'd to <IT>Acts of Religion, my doughty Antagonist</IT> thus concludes: <Q>''This is enough to let you see, that the <IT>Sadducees</IT> could not by their Prin&rehy;ciples be oblig'd to any <IT>Act of Religion</IT>.''</Q> <IT>This Conclusion</IT> is somewhat strange from <IT>such Premises</IT>, and in Syllogism stands thus:</P>
<P>They who think themselves oblig'd to no <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>, are oblig'd to none.</P>
<P>The <IT>Sadducees</IT> thought themselves oblig'd to no Acts of Religion.</P>
<P><IT>Ergo</IT>. The <IT>Sadducees</IT> are oblig'd to none.</P>
<PB N="13"><P>Whether the <IT>Major</IT> of this Syllogism be not the Tenet of <IT>Deists and Atheists</IT>, let every one judge for himself. I shall quit this Head with observing, that <IT>it is plain</IT> from the Beginning and End of his Argument on this Topick, that he knew the true State of the Question; and <IT>as plain</IT>, that he constantly avoided speaking to it, because he indeed had nothing to say to the Purpose.
</P><P>It is now plain, that what he has already said, and I have already confuted, can be no Answer to my <IT>Quotation from the Proverbs</IT>: And that this <IT>Don Quixote</IT> amuses himself with <IT>fancied Conquests</IT>.</P>
<P>The Text from <IT>Solomon</IT> remains then still in full Force; and his striving to envince, that the <IT>Jews</IT> in his Reign were not ignorant of a Future State, is wholly impertinent, because I did not affirm that they were, but that they might do <IT>Acts of Religion</IT> out of the Hopes and Fears of <IT>this</IT>, as well as of the <IT>other</IT> World He would fain puzzle the Contro&rehy;versy, and have it thought, that we <IT>exclude</IT> the Belief of another World from <IT>Religion</IT>: Whereas in Truth, we <IT>exclude not</IT> another World, but oppose his <IT>excluding the Promises of This</IT>. We take the Promises and Threat&rehy;nings of <IT>both This and the other</IT> World into <IT>Religion</IT>; he <IT>excludes</IT> those, that relate to <IT>this World</IT>, and embraces only those, that re<PB
N="14">late to the <IT>other</IT>; and therefore his <IT>Religion</IT> from which <IT>one half</IT> of <IT>God's Threatnings</IT> and <IT>Promises is excluded</IT>, is truly and properly <IT>the half-fac'd Religion</IT>.</P>
<P>Having done with the <IT>Bishop's Knight-Errant</IT> I shall now come to <IT>himself</IT>, and state the Question in his own Words. In his <IT>Answer to the Committee</IT>, Pag. 151. <IT>his Lordship says:</IT> <Q
REND="it">"We are led by <RO>Christ</RO> to the firm Assurance of another World: The Belief of which, is what <RO>Alone</RO> renders our best Actions <RO>Religi&rehy;on,</RO> as it is the Principle within us, from whence they flow; and from whence, when they do not flow; they cease to be <RO>Religion.</RO>"</Q> Here it is affirm'd, that the Belief of another World is what <IT>Alone</IT> renders our best Actions <IT>Religion</IT>; which necessarily implies, that the Hopes and Fears of <IT>this World</IT> are no where propounded by our <IT>Saviour</IT>, as Motives to Obedience: For if they are, then Actions flowing from the Belief of God's Promises in <IT>this World</IT>, flow from a <IT>Religious Principle</IT>. And that we are led by <IT>Christ</IT> to the Belief of such Promises, is plain from his own Words, <IT>Matt.</IT> vi.33. <q rend=it>Seek ye first the Kingdom of <ro>God</ro> and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you</q>. In those Words a Future State in indeed the <IT>first and chief</IT> Mo&rehy;tive, but not as his <IT>Lordship</IT> affirms, the <IT>Sole</IT> Motive to Righteousness. <IT>Temporal Blessings</IT> <PB
N="15">are expresly promis'd; and because some Per&rehy;sons triumph in the many Warnings <IT>our Savi&rehy;our</IT> gives his Disciples of the <IT>Persecutions</IT>, they must undergo; and think that a strong Proof of a Future State being the <IT>Sole</IT> Motive to <IT>Religious Actions</IT> under the <IT>Christian Dispensa&rehy;tion</IT>: I desire it may be consider'd, that <IT>Christ</IT>, even in the same Sentence, in which he men&rehy;tions the <IT>Case of Persecution</IT>, promises his Disciples an Affluence of <IT>Temporal Blessings</IT>. This appears from <IT>Mark</IT> x.29,30. <q rend=it>And <ro>Jesus</ro> answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no Man, that hath left House, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my Sake, and the Go&rehy;spels; But he shall receive an Hundred-fold <ro>now in this Time,</ro> Houses, and Brethren, and Si&rehy;sters, and Mothers, and Children, and Lands, <ro>with Persecutions;</ro>and in the World to come Eternal Life</q>. Here our <IT>Saviour</IT> again joyns the Promises of this Life, with those of the <IT>next</IT>, even when the <IT>Case of Persecution</IT> was in his Eye: And what can be a more evi&rehy;dent Proof, that the Belief of the Promises of another World is not the <IT>Sole</IT> Principle, from whence <IT>Religious Actions</IT> in the <IT>Christian Dispensation</IT> flow; than that the <IT>Institutor</IT> of that <IT>Religion</IT> has joyned the Promises of the Blessings of <IT>this World</IT> to the Promises of those <IT>in the next</IT>, as Motives to our Obedience.</P>
<PB N="16"><P>I am sensible it may be look'd on as a Breach of good Manners, and a Piece of the highest Arrogance, for <IT>a Woman</IT> to contend with <IT>a Bishop</IT>: I shall therefore chuse to transfer the Controversy from my self to <IT>another Bishop</IT>, who, when alive, with Christian Zeal oppos'd <IT>his Lordship's Notions of Civil Government</IT>; and <IT>being dead yet speaketh</IT> against this <IT>his new Definition of Religion</IT>. The Person I mean is, <IT>the worthy Bishop</IT> Blackall <IT>of Blessed Memory</IT>, from whose sixty sixth Discourse on the Sermon in the Mount, I shall quote what is to any rational Man a sufficient Confutation of the Bishop of <IT>Bangor</IT>.
</P><P>To prove that <IT>Temporal Rewards</IT> are pro&rehy;mised in the <IT>Scripture</IT>, as Motives to <IT>Acts of Religion</IT>; that <IT>Pious Prelate</IT> quotes the <IT>Psal&rehy;mist's</IT> Words: <q rend=it>The Eye of the Lord is on them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mer&rehy;cy; To deliver their Soul from Death, and to keep them alive in Famine</q>, Psal. xxxiii.18,19. And again, <IT>Psal.</IT> xxxiv.10. <q rend=it>The young Lions do lack and suffer Hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing</q>. And again, <IT>Psal.</IT> xxxvii.18,19. <q rend=it>The Lord know&rehy;eth the Days of the Upright, and their Inheri&rehy;tance shall be for ever. They shall not be asha&rehy;med in the evil Time, and in the Days of Fa&rehy;mine they shall be satisfy'd</q>.</P>
<PB N="17"><P><Q>"These</Q>, <IT>says that good Bishop</IT>, <Q>some may say are <IT>Old Testament Promises</IT>, and so do not belong to <IT>us</IT>: But let it be consider'd, that <IT>God</IT> has been pleas'd also in the <IT>New&rehy;Testament</IT> to renew them, and to give us fresh Assurances of his Fatherly Care, in protecting and providing for good Men, <IT>even in this Life</it></q>.
</P><P><Q>St. <IT>Paul</it></q>, <IT>continues he</IT>, <Q>who writing only to <CORR
SIC="Christions"><IT>Christians</IT></CORR>, cannot be suppos'd to have encouraged them to their Duty by such Pro&rehy;mises, as do not belong to them, yet says expresly, 1 <IT>Tim.</IT> iv.8. that <IT>Godliness is pro&rehy;fitable unto all Things, having the Promise</IT> of this Life, that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship goes on to prove, <Q>that the <IT>Temporal Promises</IT> of the <IT>Old Testament</IT> are not yet out-dated, but do belong to <IT>Chri&rehy;stians</IT> as well as they did to <IT>Jews</IT>. This</Q>, he saith, <Q>we are clearly taught by the <IT>Au&rehy;thor of the Epistle to the</IT> Hebrews, <IT>Ch.</IT> xiii.5. where he declares, that the Promise made to <IT>Joshua, I will never leave thee nor for&rehy;sake thee</IT>; (altho' at the first making, it seemed to be particular and personal, made to <IT>Joshua</IT> alone) is yet to be understood, as an <IT>Evangelical Promise</IT>, made to <IT>every good Christian</IT>. And that not this Promise only, but likewise all such <IT>Temporal Pro<PB
N="18">mises</IT> in the <IT>Old Testament</IT> do belong to <IT>us Christians</IT>, no less than they did to the <IT>pious Israelites</IT>; the same <IT>Apostle</IT> plainly enough intimates in the next Words; <IT>ver.</IT> 6. by his citing another Text from thence, which he says we also may apply to our selves: So that we may boldly say, <IT>the Lord is my Helper, I will not fear what Man can do unto me</IT>."</Q></P>
<P>Thus far that excellent <IT>Prelate</IT>; to whose Argument from St. <IT>Paul</IT>, I beg leave to sub&rehy;join one of the same Nature from St. <IT>Peter</IT>; who speaking of a Blessing, to inherit which <IT>Christians</IT> are call'd by <IT>God</IT>, expresses the Na&rehy;ture of that Blessing in the Words of the Psal&rehy;mist, <IT>Psal.</IT> xxxiv.12,13,14. <q rend=it>He that will love Life, and see good Days; let him refrain his Tongue from Evil, and his Lips, that they speak no Guile; let him eschew Evil, and do good</q>, &amp;c. 1 <IT>Pet.</IT> iii.10.11.</P>
<P>From all this I thus argue;</P>
<P><IT>That Action, which flows from a firm Trust, and steadfast Belief in the Promises of God, flows from</IT> a truly Religious Principle.</P>
<P><IT>The Actions we are moved to by God's</IT> Tem&rehy;poral Promises, <IT>do (as well as those we are mov'd to by His</IT> Eternal) <IT>flow from a firm Trust in God and stedfast Belief of His Promises</IT>.</P>
<P>Ergo. <IT>The Action we are moved to by God's</IT> Temporal Promises, <IT>do (as well as those we <PB
N="19">are moved to by his</IT> Eternal) <IT>flow from</IT> a truly Religious Principle.</P>
<P>If this be granted, (and how it can be de&rehy;nied I can't see) it follows, that flowing from a <IT>truly Religious Principle</IT>, they are <IT>truly</IT> Reli&rehy;gion; and if they are <IT>truly Religion</IT>, it is false, that the Belief of another World is what <IT>Alone</IT> renders our best Actions <IT>Religion</IT>; and that when they flow not from thence; they <IT>cease to be Religion</IT>; For when <IT>each terminates in God, each constitutes an Action</IT> Religious.</P>
<P>Thus have I shewn, that the <IT>Bishop of</IT> Bangor's <IT>Definition</IT>, is, as Dr. <IT>Sherlock</IT> stiles it, <IT>a new Definition of Religion</IT>.</P>
<P>I shall close all, with observing, that if the <IT>Bishop</IT> was really the <IT>Doctor's Tutor</IT>, as the <IT>Author of the Flying-Post</IT> suggests; I cannot but congratulate the <IT>Doctor</IT> in being so like St. <IT>Cyprian</IT>, in relation to <IT>Tertullian</IT>; that is, in having copied all the <IT>Bishop's Excellencies</IT>, and with great Judgment <IT>avoided his Er&rehy;rors</IT>.</P>

<P>&Tic;HE <IT>Author of the</IT> Flying-Post, ha&rehy;ving impotently attack'd <IT>Dr.</IT> Sher&rehy;lock's <IT>Reasons for continuing the</IT> Test&rehy;Act; I shall vindicate the <IT>Doctor</IT> from his insolent Malice, and add a Word or two on that Subject. The Principle, on which the <IT>Doctor</IT> justifies that Act, is <IT>Self&rehy;Defence</IT>; and sure no Adherent of the <IT>Bi&rehy;shop of</IT> Bangor, <IT>that great Patron of</IT> Self&rehy;Defence to the <IT>State</IT>, will deny the same Priviledge to the <IT>Church</IT>. It is true the <IT>Dissenters</IT> are by some represented, as harm&rehy;less People, content with their <IT>Toleration</IT>; but the Reverend Mr. <IT>Lewis</IT>, in his Letter to Sir <IT>John Smith</IT>, has evinc'd the con&rehy;trary, and proved, that they aim at no&rehy;thing less, than a <IT>total Subversion to the Church of</IT> England. The Stab, they have <PB
N="21">so often repeated with their <IT>Pens</IT>, they would, if Power were in their Hands, as often repeat with the <IT>Sword</IT>.

Thus it ever was and ever will be with them: And to show that I am not singular in this Opinion, I shall quote a few Sentences from <IT>Parker's Ecclesiastical Polity</IT>, wrote in the Reign of <IT>King</IT> Charles <IT>the Second</IT>, which unanswerably prove it true. They are all collected out of his Fifth Chapter:
</P><P><Q>"No <IT>Party</IT> can ever be quiet or con&rehy;tent, as long as it is under any other, but will ever be heaving and struggling to dismount that Power, that keeps it down: And therefore we find, that <IT>all Dissenters from the establish'd Frame of Things</IT> are always assaulting it with open Violence, or undermining it by secret Practices. &horfill; Oppress'd they are as long as they are the weaker Party. &horfill; It is an eternal Truth with them; that <IT>for the Godly Party not to be uppermost, is and ever will be Persecution</IT>. &horfill; All <IT>Sects</IT> <PB

So that if all <IT>our Dissenting Sectaries</IT> were allow'd their entire Liberty, nothing can be expected, (especially from People of their Complexion) but that they should all Plot together against the <IT>present Esta&rehy;blishment of the Church</IT>. &horfill; Apprehen&rehy;ding the <IT>Way of Worship now establish'd by Law</IT>, Defective and Superstitious, they cannot but be bound in Conscience to endeavour its utter Ruin and Subversion. &horfill; We never find this Way of <IT>Toleration</IT> put in Practice under any Government, but where <IT>other Exigencies of State</IT> required and kept up a <IT>Standing Army</IT>. &horfill; So that unless we are willing to put our selves to the Expence and Hazard of keeping up <IT>Standing Forces, Indulgence to Dissenting Zealots</IT> does but expose <IT>the State</IT> to the perpetual Squabbles and Wars of <IT>Reli&rehy;gion</IT>. &horfill; Though the <IT>State</IT> think itself unconcerned to restrain Mens Persuasi&rehy;ons and Opinions; yet methinks they should be a little concerned to pre&rehy;vent the Tumults and Disturbances, that naturally arise from their Propagation. &horfill; <PB
N="23">For the Common-wealth will be eternally torn with intestine Quarrels and Commo&rehy;tions till it grow so wise again, as to sup&rehy;press <IT>all Parties but one</IT>; that is, till it re&rehy;turn to that Wisdom and Prudence, from whence it departed by <IT>Toleration</it></q>.</P>
<P>I hope no one will <IT>misapply</IT> any of these Sentences to a Meaning, never intended by the <IT>Author</IT> in Writing or <IT>me</IT> in quoting them: If any stretch them to such a Purpose, let him answer for it; I am not concern'd. I shall conclude the whole with <IT>one Quotation more</IT> out of his <IT>sixth Chapter</IT>, for the Application of which, I believe, few will be at a loss.</P>
<P><Q>"All the <IT>pious Villannies</IT>, that have ever disturb'd the <IT>Christian World</IT>; have shelter'd themselves in this grand Maxim; <IT>That</IT> Jesus Christ <IT>is the only Lawmaker to his Church; and whoever takes upon him to prescribe any Thing in Religion; invades his Kingly Of&rehy;fice</IT>."</Q> The <IT>Gnosticks</IT> of old so abus'd this Pretence, to justifie any Seditious and Licen&rehy;tious Practices, that they made <IT>heathen Princes</IT> look on <IT>Christianity</IT> as an Enemy to Govern&rehy;ment: And the <IT>Fanaticks</IT> of late, have so vex'd and embroil'd <IT>Christendom</IT> with the same Principle, that <IT>Christian Princes</IT> themselves be&rehy;gin to be of the same Persuasion. It is become the only Patron and Pretext of Sedition; and <PB
N="24">when any Subjects have a Mind to set them&rehy;selves free from the Laws of their Prince, they can never want this Pretence to warrant their Disobedience; seeing there is no Nation in the World, that has not divers Laws, that are not recorded by the <IT>four Evangelists</IT>. And therefore, if all <IT>human Institutions</IT> intrench upon <IT>our Saviour's Kingly Prerogative</IT>, they are, and ever must be provided with Matters of Quarrel <IT>to disturb Government and justify Rebellion</IT>.</P>
