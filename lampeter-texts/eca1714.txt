<HEAD>SOME <BO>OBSERVATIONS</BO>, SHEWING <IT>The DANGER of Losing the</IT> TRADE <IT>of the Sugar Colonies</IT>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<p>&Tic;HERE has been a Paper already offered to the Publick, concerning the State of the Sugar Plantations, with Respect to the Ecclesiastick, Civil, and Military Government, wherein some Remarks are also to be met with <IT>upon the Trade of those Colonies</IT>: But what is <IT>principally</IT> intended <IT>by this</IT>, is to consider more particularly the Nature and present Circumstances of this most <IT>valuable Trade</IT>, and to lay before the Parliament the imminent <IT>Dangers</IT> we are threatned with, of <IT>utterly losing</IT> the same, <IT>unless</IT> proper Mea&rehy;sures be <IT>quickly</IT> taken to settle it upon a better Foun&rehy;dation than it has been for many Years past.
</P><P>In order to this, it must be observed, That the <IT>Portugueze</IT> in <IT>Brazil</IT>, the <IT>Dutch</IT> in <IT>Surinam</IT>, and <IT>Isa&rehy;Cape</IT>, and the <IT>French in their Islands</IT>, especially in that great Island of <IT>Hispaniola</IT>, in which they have got a great Footing, are possess'd of large Coun&rehy;tries and great Tracts of fertile Land, which <IT>pro&rehy;duce</IT> Provisions, and most other Necessaries and <PB
N="4">Conveniences for Life, and likewise Materials and Requisites for manufacturing Sugar and other the Product of their Land, such as Timber, Horses, Cattle, <IT>&amp;c.</IT></P>
<P>And on the <IT>other hand, the English</IT> Sugar Planta&rehy;tions are upon <IT>small Islands; Barbadoes</IT>, which is but Twenty one Miles in Length, and about Twelve Miles over in the broadest Part, being the largest of them all, excepting <IT>Jamaica</IT>; and even that Island is not well inhabited; has a great Deal of <IT>Savanna</IT> Land, is very mountainous, and in War is very much ex&rehy;posed; so that if the Windward Islands should come to be deserted or lost, <IT>Jamaica</IT> could never be kept and improved so as to support the Sugar Trade to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Further, these our small Islands being <IT>obliged to the British Dominions</IT> for almost every Thing, such as Servants and Slaves, and Provisions of all Sorts, and for all Materials and Necessaries for manu&rehy;facturing their Sugar, and other the Product of their Ground, tho' they are thereby the more <IT>pro&rehy;fitable</IT> to this Kingdom, yet by this Means <IT>they make Sugar the dearer</IT>; but that which adds to their Misfortune, is, that their Land is so poor, that they must be at a great Expence in manuring it, and must plant the same Ground every other Year: Whereas in the Colonies of the aforesaid Nations, there's Room enough to change their Ground, and if there were not, yet the Land is so fertile, that they plant but once in seven, and sometimes but in ten Years, and that without Dung; so that in Con&rehy;sequence of all those Advantages over us, <IT>they must undersell us at Foreign Markets</IT>, and in time furnish our Markets at Home <IT>cheaper</IT> than we can, and in the end <IT>beat us entirely out of the Sugar Trade</IT>.</P>
<PB N="5"><P>This cannot be thought improbable, if it be con&rehy;sider'd, that in other Nations the same Causes have had the like Effects; for this was the Case many Years ago with a Part of the <IT>Turkish</IT> Dominions, where there were many Sugar-Works; for it seems, that they were at so great Expence and Charge in making Sugars, that they were furnished from us cheaper than they made them themselves; so that by Degrees <IT>we had</IT> all the Trade for Sugar to the <IT>Levant</IT>, for <IT>then</IT> it was that <IT>our Plantations flourished</IT>, the Land was fertile, and the <IT>Planters had Plenty</IT> of Timber, Provisions, and other Necessaries, and <IT>were</IT> also <IT>regularly</IT> supply'd with sufficient Numbers of Slaves at easie Rates: But since our Plantations <IT>have fallen to Decay</IT>, and the Land become barren, but <IT>especially since the Scarcity and Dearness of Slaves</IT>, we make Sugar <IT>so dear</IT>, that the <IT>Portugueze</IT> and others have in a great Measure beat us out of that bene&rehy;ficial Trade, because they can furnish those Markets cheaper than we; and for the same Reasons it will appear, that we <IT>are</IT> in Danger of being <IT>stripped</IT> of this, and of all our Foreign Sugar Trade, when it's considered, that the <IT>French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT> in their Co&rehy;lonies can make this Commodity as cheap as the <IT>Portugueze</IT> in <IT>Brazil</IT>.
</P><P>These Things, it's hoped, clearly <IT>demonstrate how near the Desolation of the Sugar Islands is at hand</IT>, upon the Footing that the Trade stands at present, which must be attended with the <IT>Loss</IT> of a con&rehy;siderable Trade to these Dominions; it may be computed one way or other at near <IT>two Millions Sterling <FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Annum</FOREIGN></IT>, which must bring Ruin upon many thousand Families in the Plantations, and ma&rehy;ny more Thousands in these Kingdoms.</P>
<PB N="6"><P>This doth not depend upon Speculation; the Facts are plain and most of them self-evident; and if any Doubt arises upon any of them, <IT>there are un&rehy;deniable Proofs ready to be offered to the Parliament</IT>, in order to confute every thing that can be suggested to the contrary.
</P><P>It is therefore humbly hoped, that in an Affair of so great Consequence, the Wisdom of the Legi&rehy;slature will at last, and while <IT>yet</IT> they have it in their Power, effectually interpose their Authority, and by their <IT>seasonable Resolutions</IT> prevent this impending Evil: And it is humbly offered by the Planters, who are most <CORR
SIC="immmediately">immediately</CORR> concern'd, and may be presum'd to know the State of this Case, at least as well as any other Men, that nothing will preserve and support the Sugar Plantations, but the <IT>securing</IT> as much as possible <IT>the whole Trade to Africa</IT>, in the Hands of the Subjects of <IT>Great Britain</IT>: By which Method we may <IT>yet</IT> put our selves into a Capacity of cutting off all other Nations, or at least of ma&rehy;king it difficult for them to get any great Number of Slaves from the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT>; the Conse&rehy;quence thereof must be, that then their Plantations <IT>for Want of Labourers</IT> would be so far from multi&rehy;plying and encreasing, that those they are already possess'd of must fall to Decay: So that to me it seems evident, that we have no other Way left, but only this, to recover and preserve the Sugar Trade in our own Hands.</P>
<P>Nor will this be impracticable, if it be remem&rehy;ber'd, that within less than thirty Years, when the <IT>African</IT> Company flourished, and had <IT>Power upon that Coast</IT>, they had much the greatest Part of the <IT>Negroe</IT> Trade; <IT>they had then</IT>, and for many Years before, <PB
N="7">such Interest among the <IT>Negroe</IT> Kings and great Men' and <IT>such Power</IT> over them, that the Natives in ge&rehy;neral could dispose of but very few <IT>Negroes</IT> to other Nations; nay, such was the Company's Power in those Times, that the <IT>French</IT> had not so much as one Factory upon the Gold Coast; it's true, they once attempted to make a Settlement, and for that end sent out a Squadron of six Men of War with Men, and Stores, and Ammunition, and all other Neces&rehy;saries to erect a Fortification; but after they had landed, and built a Fort, the very Night before they were to mount their great Guns, the <IT>Negroes</IT> came down upon them, and beat them off, and de&rehy;molished their Fort, and so they went on Board their own Ships again, <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">re infect&acirc;</FOREIGN></IT>.</P>
<P>Such was <IT>then</IT> the Interest of the <IT>English</IT> with those <IT>Barbarians</IT>, that they would not suffer the <IT>French</IT> to settle among them; it's true, the <IT>Dutch</IT> had and have a great many Forts and Factories all along this Coast, but <IT>their Slave Trade in those Days</IT> was very <IT>inconsiderable</IT> in comparison of ours: In&rehy;deed, since the Trade has been laid open by the late Act of Parliament; the great Contentions that have arisen between the Separate Traders and the Company; the Abuses committed by the Company's Agents upon the Coast, by confederating with the Separate Traders to the Prejudice of the Company; <IT>the Strugglings amongst the Separate Traders themselves</IT> at the Market, which has also greatly contributed to the Raising of the Prices of <IT>Negroes</IT> very high; and the many Violences, and unfair and illegal Practices committed by some of the open Traders on the Coast, for which the <IT>Company has often paid very dear</IT>: Such a Conjunction, I say, of fatal Circumstances, which are and always must be the unavoidable Con&rehy;sequences of a <IT>loose and precarious Trade</IT>, could not <PB
N="8">but tend exceedingly to the lessening and under&rehy;mining the <IT>British</IT> Power and Interest on that Coast; insomuch that, I may appeal to Experience, whe&rehy;ther the <IT>Dutch</IT> or the Natives of <IT>Africa</IT> have not been greater Gainers by that Act, <IT>than either</IT> Great Britain <IT>or the Plantations</IT>; as to the <IT>Dutch</IT> it's evident, that since the passing that Act, they have gained a greater Power and Trade on that Coast than they had before; and that they have wonderfully en&rehy;creased their Sugar Plantations in <IT>Surinam</IT> and <IT>Isa Cape</IT>; and as for the <IT>Africans</IT>, they are <IT>become so wise by our Divisions</IT>, that they have <IT>raised the Price of</IT> Negroes <IT>to near</IT> 20l. <IT>per Head</IT>, whereas formerly the Company bought them from 50<IT>s.</IT> to 3<IT>l.</IT> at most, and the Planters in those Days were furnished from 14<IT>l.</IT> to 18<IT>l. per Head</IT>, the choice Negroes; this advanced the <IT>Number</IT> of Slaves in the Island of <IT>Bar&rehy;badoes to near</IT> 80000, which <IT>produced</IT> in <IT>Barbadoes</IT> near 30000 <IT>Hogsheads of Sugar yearly</IT>, besides Cotton and other Commodities, which <IT>advanced</IT> the Re&rehy;venue, <IT>comsumed</IT> a great Quantity of the <IT>Manufactures of</IT> England, and employ'd near 500 Sail of <IT>English</IT> Shipping: But since by these Contentions upon the Coast, the Price of <IT>Negroes</IT> has been <IT>so high</IT>, the Planters have paid from 30<IT>l.</IT> to 40<IT>l.</IT> and in some of the Islands 50<IT>l. per Head</IT>, and this has <IT>lessened</IT> the Number of <IT>Negroes</IT>, which now is under 60000 in <IT>Barbadoes</IT>, and the Product which is under 20000 Hogsheads of Sugar, and other the Product in Pro&rehy;portion; so that the Consumption of the Manu&rehy;factures, the Revenue, and the Navigation have <IT>decreased</IT> also in Proportion, so that upon the whole it's very apparent from Experience, that nothing but an united Power upon the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT> can secure this Trade: Power, <IT>and the Purse, Force, and Merchandize must be united</IT>, and put into <IT>one</IT> and the same Hand.</P>
<PB N="9"><P>For this purpose a <IT>Considerable Stock</IT> must be Staked, which <IT>cannot</IT> be done Effectually any o&rehy;ther way than in a Body Exclusive of all others; this will be a certain Stake in the Hedge to sup&rehy;port the Trade; for the Body politick <IT>will always remain</IT>: The Men, 'tis true may be changed, but the Body it's self <IT>may be Obliged</IT> to supply the Plantations with sufficient Numbers of <IT>Negroes</IT> at reasonable Prices, whereas <IT>any other</IT> sort of Com&rehy;pany than that of a Joynt Stock, <IT>cannot</IT> Oblige themselves, nor can they give any Security that they will Trade, neither can they be secure of a suf&rehy;ficient Stock for carrying on the Trade, Merchants being at Liberty in all other sorts of Company's, whether they will come in or no; and if they do come in for one Year, <IT>may leave it the next</IT>. And it's presumed further that no other but a Joynt Stock Company will be tyed down to fur&rehy;nish the Plantations only with <IT>Negroes, for it's very well known</IT>, that <IT>most of the</IT> Negroes, Imported in&rehy;to the Plantations by the separate Traders; during the late Act of Parliament, <IT>were Exported again</IT> to the <IT>Spaniards, French</IT> and <IT>Dutch</IT>, but principally to the <IT>Spaniards</IT>. And certainly it can never be de&rehy;nyed, but that, if Merchants are left to their Liberty, they will Trade with those Nations who can better give 40<IT>l.</IT> per Head than the <IT>British</IT> Planter can give 20<IT>l.</IT> for Merchants <IT>will have regard to their own private gain</IT>; but it's not doubted but that the Parliament will consider that every <IT>Negroe</IT> sold to the <IT>British</IT> Planter, tho' under 20<IT>l.</IT> brings <IT>much greater</IT> advantage to this Kingdom, than one sold to other Nations at 40<IT>l.</IT> or even at Fourscore; because the Labour of a <IT>Negroe</IT> brings <IT>Annually ten Pounds</IT> during his Life; and as his Children grow up, their Labour amounts to as much more each. It's next to be considered, that, it will be <PB
N="10"><IT>Impossible</IT> to perform the Assiento Contract unless an Exclusive Company with a Joynt Stock be Established in Manner aforesaid; for if a Number of Men, open Traders, should enter into an Agree&rehy;ment for the performance of this Contract, <IT>they must make Subscriptions</IT>, and this will <IT>become</IT> a Stock, and <IT>Interfere</IT> with all other open Traders; and should such a thing happen, what advantage will the Out-ports of <IT>Great Britain</IT> have; when they try the Trade to <IT>Africa</IT>, they will find that the Numbers of Traders that live at <IT>London</IT> will so Govern the Market upon the Coast, that <IT>other Traders will not be able</IT> to come in Competition with them, or otherwise, what has been and is the Case already, will continue, <IT>viz.</IT> that by <IT>Struggling</IT> with one another upon the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT>, they will not only keep up the price of Slaves there, but raise it still higher, and so put the Trade in a <IT>worse Condition</IT> than it's now in; and make the <IT>A&rehy;fricans</IT> wiser and wiser by throwing the <IT>profit</IT> in&rehy;to their hands; so that at last they being at Li&rehy;berty to Trade with whom they please, will find the Sweet of Trading <IT>with other Nations</IT>, who <IT>can give</IT> them <IT>at least as much again</IT> as the <IT>British</IT> Mer&rehy;chants can, by which means it must in the End come to pass, that, even those that would pretend to secure the <IT>African</IT> Trade most, will not be able to purchase any Slaves at all: But should any Sett of open Traders pretend to secure the <IT>African</IT> Trade to this Nation; then it's presumed, they must have Forts, Castles and Factories; If they build them, <IT>they must Consider of whom they are to purchase the Land</IT>, and <IT>the great Expence</IT> that must attend such an undertaking; but allowing that such a Sett of Men could get over that, then it's plain there will be <IT>two Company's</IT>, the Consequence whereof need not be mentioned. But it may <PB
N="11">be supposed that this present Company may be <IT>Compelled</IT> to part with their Forts and Factories, and all their property upon the Coast; but <IT>can this be any more than changing Hands</IT>, if any Sett of Men be put in Possession of those Forts, <IT>&amp;c.</IT> and make Subscriptions sufficient to secure the Assiento Contract, and a sufficient Importation of <IT>Negroes</IT> to the Plantations at reasonable Prices. And <IT>if this Security is not given</IT>, then <IT>what will become</IT> of the Plantations and the Assiento Contract.
</P><P>Were it not therefore more consistent with Reason and Justice to consider, that, many Years ago, the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT> was by Charter granted to the present <IT>African</IT> Company; that at the time that that Charter was granted, <IT>the Trade was in a manner lost to this Nation</IT>, which the Company soon after <IT>recovered</IT> and vastly Improved; that they have since laid out great Sums of Money upon Forts and Factories and in <IT>carrying on</IT> this Trade; that for many Years they furnished the Plantations <IT>at easy Prices</IT>, and gave long Credit; that by these means the Sugar Colonies were Settled and did a&rehy;rise to a great Heighth; that in the first and second Years of the first of the two last Wars, they lost near Thirty Ships of their own; that the <IT>French</IT> committed great Depredations upon some of their Factories; that they have sustained great Losses by the Hurricane and Earthquake in <IT>Jamaica</IT>; and by their Out-standing Debts in that and the other Plantations; and lastly that they have <IT>suf&rehy;fered</IT> many great <IT>hardships</IT> by the late Act of Par&rehy;liament, which did indeed Ordain that all Sepa&rehy;rate Traders should pay 10 <IT>per Cent.</IT> to the Com&rehy;pany on all their Exports, for and towards the Maintenance of their Forts; whereas it appears from the Entries of the Separate Traders, that they never <PB
N="12">paid the Company above 1 <IT>per Cent.</IT> Would it not I say, be Justice to give this Company an Oppor&rehy;tunity of retrieving those Losses, and to Enable them to take Subscriptions, for a sufficient Stock to carry on the Trade, and to get the power of the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT> again into their own Hands: Which great point cannot otherways be gained but by Merchandize, and Power being in one and the same Hand, to make Alliances with the <IT>Negroe</IT> Kings, that they may sell their Slaves only to the Com&rehy;pany. Is it not very plain that since this late Act of Parliament, <IT>Negroes have risen</IT> in their Price upon the Coast, and that the <IT>Planters have paid much dearer</IT> in the Plantations, and have been but ill Supplied? Tho' it may be allowed that the Wars were part&rehy;ly the Cause of the last Evil, yet it cannot be thought so of the first, which was Occasion'd by the many buyers on the Coast, and they must ra&rehy;ther Increase in Peace, so that <IT>that Evil will still grow upon us</IT>.</P>
<P>But it is Objected that in a Company Exclusive, there being but one buyer, tho' that Company may buy Cheaper upon the Coast, yet they may Impose what Prices they please upon the Planters for their <IT>Negroes; to which</IT> I think it may be suf&rehy;ficient to <IT>answer</IT>, that <IT>the Planters have already found it to be otherwise</IT> by Experience, besides the Com&rehy;pany are willing, it seems, to be Subject to any Regulation or Enquiry that the Parliament shall appoint, if the Planters Complain.</P>
<P>Another Objection is, that this Company will be the only Buyer of the Manufactures in this Kingdom, and so Impose what Prices they please. But <IT>was this ever Complained of</IT>, even before the late Act of Parliament? Yea, did not the present Com<PB
N="13">pany almost every Year before that Act passed, either <IT>Increase their Exports</IT>, or set a-foot some <IT>new Manufacture</IT> or other; and may not the same Jealousie arise from any Set of Men combining in that Trade. As for the <IT>Out-Ports</IT> they may flatter themselves, but they will soon find their Mistake, and that by aiming at a Trade, they may <IT>be Instru&rehy;mental in losing of it to all Her Majesty's Dominions</IT>, and at last of ruining the Plantation Trade it self; which they now feel the Sweet of, and thereby be the Occasion not only of the Loss of the Consumption of 100,000<IT>l.</IT> of Merchandize Exported to the Coast of <IT>Africa</IT>, but also of <IT>the Loss of Two Millions a Year to all the Queen's Dominions</IT>, should the Planta&rehy;tions be deserted, which must happen in a few Years, if the Trade to <IT>Africa</IT> is not so settled that the <IT>British</IT> Planters may not only have <IT>sufficient</IT> Numbers of <IT>Negroes</IT> at easy Prices, but other Na&rehy;tions cut off as much as possible from that Trade.</P>
<P>It has been often said that the War occasioned the dear Prices of <IT>Negroes</IT> in the Plantations, no doubt the Navigation and every thing being dear, and the great Risque, must have raised the Price of <IT>Negroes</IT> in the Plantations: But are not the buying of them dear and the Mortality that frequently attends such Voyages too, much greater Causes of their high Prices, which a Company, being but one buyer, can only prevent; for when they Command the Price upon the Coast, they can have them Cheap, buy them up, and have them <IT>ready</IT> against the Arrival of their own Ships: So that they may be dispatched in a Month, or Six Weeks; where&rehy;as Separate Traders have been Obliged to stay sometimes Four or Five Months before they could purchase their Compliment of Slaves. Was it the War that was the Cause of the Planters being <PB
N="14">ill Supplied, when the Separate Traders affirm, in Seven Years, they imported into the Plantations 150,000 <IT>Negroes</IT>: No, if all those <IT>Negroes</IT> had been settled in the Plantations, there could have been no Complaint for want of Supply; but it's plain, if any truth in this great Importation, they were carried to other Nations: And I may Appeal to the Separate Traders, whether during the late Act of Parliament, they have not been Losers by what <IT>Negroes</IT> they have sold to the <IT>British</IT> Planters, take these 15 Years last past round; <IT>particular Men may have got</IT>, but its plain <IT>the Traders in General lost</IT>; and particular Men may get again, and after they have done their Business, leave off the Trade; but it's hoped that upon better Consideration, they will become more publick Spirited, and pre&rehy;ferr the preservation of the Plantations to their own private Gain, and become Subscribers to the Stock of the present Company; and Consent and Assist in supporting their Charter and Pri&rehy;vileges, by becoming Proprietors in the same, <IT>ra&rehy;ther than</IT> Endeavour <IT>to destroy the property</IT> of a Com&rehy;pany, that in a manner settled the profitable Su&rehy;gar Colonies, and have met with great Losses, which with the aforementioned Hardships and In&rehy;jury's have brought them Low, 'till the late Act of Parliament in Favour of their Creditors, which has revived them; for however their Necessities, during their misfortunes, might have forced them to some Shifts, which is even the Case, many times, with private Men; yet they cannot be de&rehy;nyed the Credit of this, that they have, under all these Discouragements, tho' at a very great Charge, kept Possession by the power of their Forts, Castles and Factories upon the Coast; and <IT>are now going on briskly with the Trade</IT>, that <IT>again</IT> Offers its self to this Kingdom; a Trade that Offers many advan<PB
N="15">tages, not only the Consumption of Manufactures for the purchase of <IT>Negroes</IT>, for carrying on the profitable Plantation Trade, but the great Con&rehy;sumption that may be Introduced amongst the <IT>Negroes</IT>, of our Manufacture, even Equal to that in New <IT>Spain</IT>: Besides, by <IT>penetrating</IT> into that great Country, no doubt Gold and Silver Mines may be found out Equal to the <IT>Spanish</IT> or <IT>Portu&rehy;gueze</IT> Mines; but then this can <IT>never be Effected by Separate Traders</IT>, or otherways, than by the power of a Company Exclusive; for the State and Con&rehy;dition of the <IT>Africans must not be compared</IT> to that of the <IT>Turks</IT> or <IT>Muscovites</IT>, from whom we must <IT>take</IT> Laws, and such Trade as they will agree to; but in <IT>Africa</IT> we might <IT>give</IT> not only the Natives, but even all other Nations, Laws, which can be no other way done, but by such an Establishment as has been mentioned.</P>
<P>We have been <IT>too many Years instructing</IT> the <IT>French, Dutch</IT> and <IT>Portugueze</IT>, to take this Trade into their own Hands, and have gone a good Length in <IT>teaching</IT> the <IT>Africans to keep us all under their Command</IT>; therefore <IT>it's high time</IT> to put this Trade on a <IT>certain Foot</IT>, for otherwise, <IT>Adieu</IT>, not only to the <IT>African</IT>, but to the Plantation Trade.</P>
