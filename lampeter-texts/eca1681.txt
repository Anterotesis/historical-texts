<P>&Fic;Orasmuch as there is a very great Complaint in most of the Market-Towns in this Kingdom, of the <IT>Great Decay of Trade</IT>, both by many Working, and especially by all Ancient Shop-keeping Trades&rehy;men, as <IT>The Woollen Draper, the Linnen Draper, the Mercer, the Grocer</IT>, and others, whose Trades were formerly the most Flourishing in this Kingdom, that now are become so mean and ordinary, that many interested therein cannot live upon them; This may afford matter of admiration to many Persons, whilest considering withal that there are as many Goods Imported into this Kingdom as ever there were, if not abun&rehy;dantly more; and so consequently, there is as much sold as ever there were, if not much more. Now the End of this Treatise is to shew, that the Reason is not from the total defect or want of Trade, but from the irregularity or disorder thereof, it being quite out of the Channel in which it was wont formerly to run. And this hath hap&rehy;ned through a neglect of a due Execution of those Laws that are in force concerning Trade; As likewise for want of Additional Laws to be made to keep it in its due bounds. (For a Law not executed is al&rehy;most as little significant as no Law at all.) Now the Ground of this Grievance is, because many do believe, That all Men promiscuously ought to have Liberty to set up any Trade for a Livelihood, and espe<PB
N="2">cially the Shop-keeping Trade, and that a Restraint hereof doth much impeach Ingenuity; Whence it is, that Tradesmen can seldom be Redressed herein, although they have often Attempted it to their great Cost and Charge. But certainly, in former Ages People were of another Opinion, as appeareth by that Statute of 5 Queen <IT>Eliz.</IT> which Prohibiteth the taking of any Artificers Son to be an Appren&rehy;tice to many Shop-keeping Trades that are mentioned in that Statute. And likewise the Son of any one, unless his Parent had forty shil&rehy;lings <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">per Annum</FOREIGN></IT>, a Freehold Estate; which was to be Certified un&rehy;der the Hands and Seales of three Justices of the Peace.</P>
<P>And for this Reason, a long time there hath been little or no Inspe&rehy;ction made into Trade, in the Cities and Market Towns in <IT>England</IT>; that all things in Trade are come to a wonderful Confusion, as will ap&rehy;pear by the Sequel of this Treatise. Nay, there is scarce any thing of Affairs in a Kingdom or a State, <CORR
SIC="bua">but</CORR> in time will be out of Order, if it be not prevented by Reviving Old, or Constituting New Lawes, additional thereunto; For humane Lawes are such, that in time there will be Reason, either to add some&rehy;thing to, or take something from them. And whilest that any thing is out of Order, all Men that are therein concerned are Prejudiced by it: And so it is at this time with Trade, which rendreth it unprofitable to all Men, and so doth rather hinder Ingenuity then further it and promote it; Profit being a chief and more immediate Encouragement thereof, which puts men upon all Praise-worthy and commendable Undertakings. Now to the end, that I may discover what it is that hath so much Empaired the Trade of this Kingdom, I shall faithfully Relate (as to matter of Fact) what is the Practice in most Places in <IT>England</IT>, and shall in each Particular suggest what may be necessary for the Repair&rehy;ing thereof.</P></DIV>
<DIV N="II" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. II <LB><IT>Concerning the Clothing Trade, or Woollen Manufacturer, that makes any thing with our Wooll</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic; Begin with this Trade, because it is like the Water to the Mill that driveth Round the Wheel of all other Trades. For by this the Poor <PB
N="3">hath Money of their own Earning, without being burthensom to the Parish; which they presently lay out again, either upon their Backs or Bellies, not keeping their Money against a wet day, (as the saying is) Now if it be considered, how Numerous the Poor of this Kingdom are, they would (had they money) make a very great Consumption, both of the Farmers Commodities, and of all other course and ordi&rehy;nary things, as is evident in that, in some Places where this Trade did once flourish, many Labourers therein would lay out five or six shil&rehy;lings every Week throughout the year upon Meat; where there is not so much now laid out by any such poor Man hardly in a whole year.</P>
<P>And indeed, of all the Trades in this Kingdom this ought chiefly to be encouraged, neither should any stone be left unturned to pro&rehy;mote it. For if it be so, as doubtless it is, that God hath given to e&rehy;very Countrey some particular Commodity, that is not to be had any where else, so that none may boast, but that every Countrey must be beholding unto another for something that they have not; then cer&rehy;tainly it must be this, that is the Commodity of <IT>England</IT>, because God hath not only given us <IT>Wooll</IT> in abundance that makes Cloth, but also another necessary Material, <IT>viz. Fullers Earth</IT>, without which this Commodity is not to be made, and (as they say) is not to be found any where else, but in this Land; which is a clear Demon&rehy;stration that it is the use of our Wooll that is the special Talent, which God hath put into our hands to emprove; and not to emprove it is doubtless a very great sin, and like the hiding our Talent in a Napkin. Wherefore it is, that God hath in a great measure taken this Trade from us, and given it to a People that are more Industrious then we are.</P></DIV>
<DIV N="III" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. III <LB><IT>Concerning the Transportation of Wooll, which is one Hindrance to the Clothing Trade</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Nic;OW it is granted by all Men, that this is one great Hindrance of this Trade, for hereby there is not only Cloth made with our <PB
N="4">Wooll, which might have been made by our own People, but by mixing our Wooll with the Wooll of other Countreys, there is al&rehy;most twice as much Cloth made as otherwise there could be; for without the help of our Wooll, there could be little or no ordinary low pric'd Cloth made, which is the Assertment that is mostly used, there being a far greater Number who wear this, then there are who wear any finer sort; and by this means it is, that our <IT>English</IT> Cloth is so great a drug in all places, as now it is: And unless we can keep our Wooll and Fullers Earth from being Transported, that so it may be wrought up by our own People, the Trade can never be good a&rehy;gain in <IT>England</IT>. Indeed, there have been many ways thought of to prevent this mischief, which of all others is the greatest to this King&rehy;dom, and therefore of late it is made Felony for any one to Trans&rehy;port Wooll, which Law, notwithstanding the great severity thereof, doth yet prove ineffectual. Now it may be supposed, that the Cause hereof is, the Paucity or Fewness of the Informers, (for the Life of the Man is concerned which offendeth in this Case) which would not be so, if there were only a good part of the Offenders E&rehy;state lying at stake. Seeing then that this, as well as other ways, have hitherto proved ineffectual, there may therefore (I humbly conceive) be new Measures taken: Wherefore I shall suggest what may be thought profitable in this Case.
</P><LIST REND="it"><ITEM><LABEL><RO>1.</RO></LABEL> That all Persons that live within six Miles of the Sea-side, round from beyond <RO>Newcastle</RO> to <RO>Bristol</RO>, should be Enjoyned by a Law to sell all their Wooll at a <RO>Market</RO>, and in default hereof should be liable to a Pe&rehy;nalty.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>2.</RO></LABEL> That these <RO>Markets</RO> be six or seven miles from the Sea-side.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>3.</RO></LABEL> That all Persons that are allowed to buy at these <RO>Markets</RO>, should be Enjoyned to give Security, <RO>viz.</RO> Their own Bond; And to take an Oath, that what Wooll they buy at these <RO>Markets</RO>, they will either use it them&rehy;selves, or not sell it again in any Place, within six or seven miles of the Sea-side, and that they will not any way be Instrumental in the Trans&rehy;porting of any of our Wooll or Fullers Earth, to any Parts beyond the Sea; And if they do know of any Wooll that is Transported, or that is <PB
N="5">about to be Transported, that they will forthwith discover the same; And that every one that hath taken this Oath, and given this Security, should have a Certificate of the same; And he that shall buy at any of these <RO>Markets</RO> before he hath this Certificate, should be liable to a Penalty.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>4.</RO></LABEL> Because the present Law is a little short in this Clause, until the Wooll be put a Ship-board, which being done is presently gone to Sea, and there is no discovery of it. Therefore it would be necessary that the Law should be in force in these following particulars.
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL><RO>1.</RO></LABEL> If any Wooll should be taken in any Creek, or Corner, by the Sea-side ready to be Shipt.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>2.</RO></LABEL> If any Wooll should be taken within six or seven Miles of the Sea&rehy;side driving towards the same, after such an hour in the evening, or before such an hour in the morning that shall be thought convenient.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>3.</RO></LABEL> If any Wooll shall be at any time driving towards the Sea-side in the day time, and within six or seven Miles of the same, it shall be lawful for any one to cause the Person that doth drive it to be examined by a Justice of Peace, and if upon examination of the said Person, or as any other person whom the Justice may think fit to examine concerning it, it shall be found that the Wooll was driving towards the Sea, with an intention of trans&rehy;porting the same, that then also the Law should be in force.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>4.</RO></LABEL> That if any person or persons shall see any of our <RO>English</RO> Wooll unload&rehy;ing out of any Ship beyound the Sea, or can by any means get the knowledge there&rehy;of, so as to testifie it upon Oath, that in this case, if ever the said Ship or Ship-Master should return again into <RO>England</RO>, they should be lyable to the Penalty of the Law, always provided that in this case there be more Witnesses then one.
</ITEM></LIST></ITEM><ITEM><P><LABEL><RO>5.</RO></LABEL> That all Merchants that shall Traffique beyond Sea, and all Captains of Men of War, and all Ship-Masters, with their Mates and Pursers, and every common Sayler do take this Oath, and give this Security, and do re&rehy;ceive a Certificate hereof before they are admitted to any of these employ&rehy;ments, and in default hereof should be lyable to a Penalty.
</P><P>Likewise all Merchants that are strangers who do reside in any of the Parts of <RO>England</RO>, and all Ship-Masters that are strangers, before either they break bulk, or take in fresh water, or Provision for their Ships in any <FW
TYPE="catch">Harbor</FW> <PB N="6">Harbour or place in <RO>England</RO>, that they should be enjoyned to give this Secu&rehy;rity, and to take this Oath, and to receive a Certificate hereof, and for default herein they should be lyable to a Penalty.
</P></ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>6.</RO></LABEL> It would be necessary also, that all persons that do live within six of seven Miles of the Sea-side, should take this Oath if they do not give the Se&rehy;curity; which may be done at their Court Leets, where every person is bound to appear.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>7.</RO></LABEL> That it would be necessary, that a very good Part of the Forfeiture should be given to him that shall discover the same.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>8.</RO></LABEL> That it may be lawful for the Clothiers, in the several Places of this Kingdom, to Hire any one to see that these Laws are put in Execution, in all the Parts of the Realm. Now if every one of these eight Particulars were made into a Law, I cannot understand but that they might be easily executed, and that they would effect the thing desired, were it not for two <RO>English</RO> Islands, <RO>viz. Jersey</RO> and <RO>Guernsey</RO>, that do live upon the Trade of Knitting of <RO>Worsted Stockins</RO>, they Knit also <RO>Worsted VVaste&rehy;coats</RO> and <RO>Petticoats</RO>; And for this Reason the Law Tolerateth several Hundreds of Tods of VVooll to be Transported thither, under which Pre&rehy;tence it is to be feared, that many hundred Tods are Transported into <RO>France</RO>; And what to do in this Particular more then hath been before Suggested, and what is already done by the Law, I cannot tell. Therefore it would be happy for this Kingdom, if they could be put upon some other employment, that so there may be no occasion to Transport any VVooll thi&rehy;ther; And we may Rationally Judge, that Knitting of Silk Stockins will be a very suitable Employment for them, because Knitting is their Trade already; And I know not but that Silken Knit Wastecoats, Petticoats and Sleeves for Women, might be as good a Commodity as they are in Worsted. Besides this, the making of Linnen Cloth may not be much improper for them.
<LIST><ITEM>First, because if we cannot supply them with Hemp and Flax out of <RO>Eng&rehy;land</RO>, they lie convenient to be supplied out of <RO>France</RO>.
</ITEM><ITEM>Secondly, because the Poor Work there at very low Rates.</ITEM></LIST></ITEM></LIST>
</DIV><PB N="7"><DIV N="IV" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. IV. <LB><IT>Concerning making our</IT> English <IT>Woollen Manufacture good and sound</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Wic;Hen this Trade was good, the Clothiers (out of a covetous mind) would extreamly stretch their Cloth upon a Rack; and many o&rehy;ther indirect ways were used, that have brought our <IT>English</IT> Cloth so much out of Credit beyond Sea, that it will be hard for us ever to re&rehy;trive it again.
</P><P>Indeed there is a law that all Cloth should be examined before it be put to sale, and that the Town Seal where it is made should be put up&rehy;on every Cloth that is made good and sound, and the letter <IT>F</IT> upon the faulty. But this is altogether neglected in most places: For the Aul&rehy;neagers that are chosen in any place are very poor men, who seldome or never Seal any Cloth, and if they were to do it, they being poor men would not dare to refuse the sealing of any rich mans Cloth, though very faulty.</P>
<P>And therefore to prevent this for the future, it would be necessary, that in all Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>, where any of our Woollen Manufacture is made, they were all in Companies, who might every year out of themselves choose Officers, that might not only seal their Cloth, but who should also promote their Trade, and rectifie and repair whatever shall at any time be amiss therein.</P>
<P>I do not mean that these Companies (according to the custom of Corporations at this time) should have any power to bar any one from setting up this trade in their Town, nor from being also of their Company, though they never served any Apprentiship to their Trade in any place whatsoever: And my reason for it is, because there cannot be too many of any such Trade in any place where the Materials that they work upon are of the growth of <IT>England, </IT>and that do imploy the poor of the Kingdom, unless that there should be so many of these Tradesmen that there will not be Materials enough for them to work upon; and that they cannot find poor enough to work them out. But in neither of these it cannot be, because of the great abundance of Wooll <PB
N="8">that we have in <IT>England</IT>, and of the abundance of Hemp and Flax we might have, did we but set to the sowing thereof, and the Numerous poor that are in all places of this Kingdom. Nay, if the Materials u&rehy;sed in a Trade be not of the growth of <IT>England</IT>, yet if the Trade be to employ the poor, as is the ma&rehy;king of Dimithys or Fustions, or the making of Buttons, or if it be the making of any thing (which upon suppo&rehy;sition that it were not made here in <IT>England</IT>) we should have it bought with our Money, and brought to us from beyond Sea, where it is made, as Bone-Lace, &amp;c. Surely in neither of these cases will it be for the com&rehy;mon good that any man should be barred from setting up any such em&rehy;ployment in any place whatsoever.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding a universal liberty (I mean, for any one to be of any Trade) would be very injurious to many Trades, as the Shop-keep&rehy;ers and many working Trades, as I shall shew in its proper place; and it would hinder men (as it doth) from falling into such employments that are for the common and general good of the Kingdom, as are all such employments before specified.</P></DIV>
<DIV N="V" TYPE="part"><HEAD>Sect. V. <LB><IT>Concerning making our Cloth Cheap as well as good</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Wic;E cannot make our <IT>English</IT> Cloth so cheap as they do in other Countreys, because of the strange idleness and stubbornness of our Poor, especially in all Places within fifty Miles of <IT>London</IT>, where the Poor are most Numerous, where Wooll is Cheapest, and where the Carriage of Oyles and Dying Stuffs is Cheaper then in most other Places in <IT>England</IT>, and therefore in all these Respects this would be the convenientest place for the setling of this Trade; But these Poor are so surly that most of them will not work at all, unless they might Earn as much in two days as will keep them a whole Week. And when they do Work, they will often Marr what they do; that hereby the Clothiers in all these Parts are greatly discouraged. Hence it is, that they cannot make their Cloth so good and so cheap as they do in other Countreys; the reason whereof is not because Pro<PB
N="9">vision is dearer in <IT>England</IT> then it is in other Countreys; For Butter and Cheese, the Poores Fare, are as Cheap here, as they are in most other Countreys; and Corn for many yeares hath been so cheap, that great quantities thereof have been Transported to the those Coun&rehy;treys where they make our Manufacture cheaper then we do.
</P><P>But one Reason hereof is, because <IT>Begging</IT> is suffered so Rife in this Kingdom, that of late years it is a sufficient Pretence for any one to beg, if they do but carry a few Commodities about the Countrey to sell. This is so much observed by all Persons, that of late the Grand Jury in many Counties have Presented it at the General Quar&rehy;ter Sessions. For there are Laws enough to suppress them, if the Ju&rehy;stices do but see after the Execution of them. Now if this Begging Trade be not suppressed, there will never be any good done, either up&rehy;on the Clothing Trade or any other, that is for a common and ge&rehy;neral good. Wherefore the <IT>Dutch</IT> do suffer no Beggars to be in their Countrey. And the <IT>French</IT> King doth endeavor to do the same in his, and we should not neglect to do the same in ours.</P>
<P>Mr. <IT>Cooke</IT> in a Treatise of his, doth give another Reason that the Poor are so surly in <IT>England</IT>; which is the Statute of the 43 of Queen <IT>Eliz.</IT> that doth Enjoyn all Parishes to provide for their Poor, and this makes them careless to provide for themselves by their own la&rehy;bour, either for the present or the future. And hence it is, if they do not beg, yet they will not work, but addict themselfes to idleness and pilfering, and to pulling of Hedges. And all this is, because they know that if they come to want the Parish is bound to keep them. Truly, this is a very ill use which they make of so Charitable a Sta&rehy;tute. But however, it would be strange cruelty not to provide for them, when they are really in want. Therefore there can be no better way, then to make them work for their living whilst they are able. And to this end it would be necessary that these following Rules were observed.</P>
<LIST REND="it"><ITEM><LABEL><RO>1.</RO></LABEL> That there be a House in every Parish at their Charges, for every Clothier, (or any other that hath any Employment for the Poor) to bring their Work unto, where shall be distributed unto each poor Person that <PB
N="10">Portion of Work which they can Perform against the Time appointed, which will save the Parish the Charge of having a stock of their own, as the Statute doth require.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>2.</RO></LABEL> That if the Poor of the Place do not know how to spin, or to do the Ma&rehy;nufacture of that Place, that then there be Dames hired at the Parish-charge to teach them; and Men may learn to spin as well as Women, and Earn as much money at it as they can at many other Employments.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>3.</RO></LABEL> That all poor People and their Children that cannot live without La&rehy;bour, and who are not otherwise Employed by the Neighbourhood, should be compelled to take Work from this House; And if they understand not how to do this Work, that they and their Children do come every day unto this Work-house, as unto a School to learn; And that they be Provided for by the Parish, until they can attain to the knowledge of this Art or Mystery, at least in some competent measure and degree. Now every old one, and every Cripple who hath the use of his hands and his eyes, may be able to do something towards a Livelihood, which if it were but two pence a day, this amounts to Twelve-pence in the Week, and two shillings will (as hath been observed) keep a poor Man or Woman (with good Husbandry) one whole Week. If then this were once put in execution, all Parishes would quickly finde their Collections for the Poor to be much less then now they are.</ITEM></LIST>
</DIV><DIV N="VI" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. VI. <LB><IT>Concerning the Damage and Loss, too often Accrewing to the Clothier, in the Sale of his Cloth</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Aic;Fter the Clothier hath taken all the care and pains that possibly he can, to make his Cloth both cheap and good, yet when he cometh to sell it, he cannot do it himself, the Factor having gotten this business wholly into his hands; for formerly, when the Clothiers left their Cloth with them to sell, allotting them a certain price; yet notwithstanding they would many times abate two pence or three pence in a yard, which the Clothier would not have done, had he sold it himself. Now so soon as the Buyers perceived this, they would buy of none but the Factor. And hence it is, they have usurped the sole Power of selling the Clothiers Cloth, both for what price and for what time, and to whom they please; in neither of which Parti&rehy;culars they will be limited.
<PB N="11"></P><P>Now by this means the Clothiers Cloth is not only sold for less many times then can be afforded, (that so the Factor might have his Salary) but they are also put to an unnecessary Charge, for formerly the Buyer always bought at <IT>Blackwell-Hall</IT>, but now he doth buy at home; and the Factor will at any time send him as many more Pieces of Cloth then he hath occasion to buy, and under pretence they are dis-heighted, will force the Clothier to pay three or four shillings a Piece for new Pressing.
</P><P>And so likewise they will sell for what time they please, detaining the Clothiers money as long as they please; for he shall not know when his Cloth is sold, nor to whom it is sold; yet a great space of time after, when the Factor is in a good Humour, then the Clothier shall know the selling of his Cloth; And after this also he must stay a considerable time before he hath his Money. And then neither shall he know to whom his Cloth is Sold; because by this means, he can at any time put the Clothier to have his Money for his Cloth, of a Person that is not solvent. So that should any Clothier ever attempt, either to take their business out of the Factors hands, or to give off their Trade, (as many of them are desirous to do, being so abused by the Factor) they can always by this means make the Clothier truckle under them. And sometimes, when they are so kind to let the Clothier have money for his occasions, they will Enter it in their Books as so much mony lent to them. Besides, should they come to know the Person to whom their Cloth is sold, yet they would be not much the better for it, for without the Factors consent they will not pay the Clothier one farthing, saying, they have had nothing to do with him, and so will not pay him any money at all; insomuch that the Clothier in selling his Cloth is as it were blind-folded, being always in the dark concerning it. And they have seldom any money to buy any thing that they deal in beforehand, for the Factor will let them have no more money then what will suffice to keep their Trade going, and that on a slow and dull pace, by which means it is impossible that either Wooll or Woollen Cloth should rise much higher then now it is. As is evident in the late briskness of that Trade, which had it not been for the Factors (as was acknowledged by an eminent Merchant) Cloth would have risen at least eighteen pence or two shillings in a yard.</P>
<PB N="12"><P>And hence it is there can be no poor Clothiers follow the Trade, that hath not a stock to lie in the Factors hands, which hath occasioned very great Confusion in many other Trades as well as this; for it hath put some upon Retailing what they make, and others upon Hawking their Ware all about the Countrey, until many of them are ruined by means of their great Charge in Travelling; but of both these Particulars I shall Treat hereafter in their proper place.
</P><P>Neither hath this been any benefit to the Merchant, for the Fa&rehy;ctors having so great a stock of the West-Countrey Clothiers in their hands, they can give what Credit they please, and can, and do make whomsoever they please Merchants, or turn Merchants them&rehy;selves, by which means the old experienced Merchants have been extreamly prejudiced and wronged. Now to Redress this great mis&rehy;chief to the Clothing Trade, these following Particulars would be necessary to be Offered.</P>
<LIST REND="it"><ITEM><LABEL><RO>1.</RO></LABEL> That no Clothier or Serge-maker, or any one that makes any Com&rehy;modity with our <RO>English</RO> Wooll, be allowed, either they themselves, or their Factors, to sell the same anywhere in <RO>London</RO>, but in <RO>Blackwell</RO>-Hall only.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>2.</RO></LABEL> That when the Factor doth sell any Clothiers Cloth, that he be obli&rehy;ged to give the Buyer a Bill of the Name of the Person, and of the place where he liveth whose Cloth he hath sold.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><CORR SIC="2."><RO>3.</RO></CORR></LABEL> That notwithstanding the Factors selling of the Clothiers Cloth, yet the Buyer should be Debtor to the Clothier, whose Cloth it is, and not to the Factor who sold the Cloth, and in default of Payment should be liable to be Sued by the said Clothier.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>4.</RO></LABEL> That if the Factor do sell the Cloth for less money then was set him by the Clothier, or should trust any Person without the Clothiers parti&rehy;cular consent to the trusting of that particular Person, that in this case the Factor should be Debtor to the Clothier for the full value of the Cloth, which was allowed him by the Clothier, in the same manner as if it were his proper Debt.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>5.</RO></LABEL> To the end that the Clothier might always know the time when his Cloth is sold, and to whom, it would be necessary that there were a Register <PB
N="13">in the Hall, wherein there might be Entred the time when the Cloth was sold, the Factors Name that sold it, the Clothiers Name and Place of A&rehy;bode, whose Cloth it is which is sold, and also the Buyers Name and Place of Abode that hath bought the same; And in this and all other Charges they observe a Mediocrity.
</ITEM></LIST><P>And then there is another inconvenience that the Clothier doth meet with in the selling of his Cloth, which is this, <IT>viz.</IT> That ma&rehy;ny times after the Buyer hath bought his Cloth at a price, and caused it to be sent out of the Hall to his own house, he hath pretended some fault to be in the Cloth, and unless the Clothier will yield to abate what he would have him, he must have his Cloth again, which hath often been a very great vexation to the Clothier.</P>
<P>Others there are who have very much abused the Clothier, by ex&rehy;acting unreasonable measure from him, and to this end many have used very indirect wayes, as the having that abomination of a yard and a yard. Nay, sometimes they have put the Cloth into a Tub of water, and after this they have Griped the Clothier exceedingly in the Measure.</P>

<P>&Wic;Hen once the Clothier hath made his Cloth both good and cheap, and is convenienced to sell it when it is made, then it would be necessary to promote the Exportation of it abroad into o&rehy;ther Countreys.
</P><P>1. Now we are very much hindred herein by the <IT>Dutch</IT>, who do make Cloth themselves, and sell it in those places where otherwise we should sell ours; but could we keep our Wooll and Fullers Earth from them, we should speedily prevent them. And it would be necessary for the Promotion of this Trade with us, that there were an high Impost laid upon all fine Cloth that shall be imported.</P>
<P>Yet the <IT>French</IT> doth deal far more unkindly with us then the <IT>Dutch</IT>, because we do take little of their Commodities; but of the other, (as it is Related by a <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="inline"><IT>Mr. Fortery</IT></NOTE> Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, in a Treatise of his, called, <IT>The Interest of</IT> England,) we do take so much, <IT>viz.</IT> of their Wines, their Linnens, and their Silken Stuffs, that the excess of these Commodities im&rehy;ported unto us, is as much as cometh to 1600000. in the year, more then our Commodities that are re-exported unto them; for which we <PB
N="15">do pay them ready money. And had not the <IT>French</IT> King found it to be true upon Examination, he would have Prohibited all our Com&rehy;modities from being brought into his Kingdom. Wherefore he laid only a very great Impost upon the same, which is <NOTE
N="*" PLACE="inline"><FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="FRA">Estus</FOREIGN>, a French Crown,</NOTE> <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="FRA">une Estus</FOREIGN></IT> upon an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="inline"><IT>Aulne</IT>, an Ell and Nail.</NOTE> <IT>Aulne</IT>. And this our Trade doth ex&rehy;treamly suffer also by all his New Conquest, where they were wont before to wear our <IT>English</IT> Cloth, which now they cannot, because of the high and great Impost that is laid upon it.</P>
<P>Now had this great Impost been laid only upon our Woollen Ma&rehy;nufacture, it might have been supposed that he did it only to neces&rehy;sitate his people to the making of the same; but seeing he hath laid the like Impost on our <IT>English</IT> Tobaccho too, argueth, his Design is to suppress any Trade whatsoever that doth belong to the <IT>English</IT>. It being then a manifest truth, that we do take off so much of their Commodities, to the great wrong and prejudice of our own Wea&rehy;vers and Tradesmen in <IT>London</IT> and <IT>Canterbury</IT>; it is very hard measure that they will take little or nothing of ours, especially seeing that this they have done formerly, and they might have continued to do the same still, had not the <IT>French</IT> King used all the Methods that possibly he could, to hinder the same or the like Negotiation, for they are as Numerous a people as ever they were, and should they wear of our <IT>Eng&rehy;lish</IT> Manufacture, as they were wont to do heretofore, that Country would be sufficient to take off almost as much as could be made in <IT>England</IT>.</P>
<P>It is true, we have endeavored to Retaliate upon some of their Commodities, especially upon their Wines; but our <IT>English</IT> Gentry do so much delight in the drinking thereof, that they do still make their way with us nothwithstanding their dearness, yet so doth not our Manufacture with them: Therefore it would be necessary to take the same Measures to beat them out of their Trade with us, as they have done to beat us out of our Trade with them. And if this were done, they would be as much perplexed for want of a Trade to put off their Wines, their Linnens and their Silken Stuffs, as we are now to put off our Wollen Manufactures. It will not then be irrational to judge that this may be done as to all three of their Commodities.</P>
<PB N="16"><P>First, As to their VVines, if the Gentry would but take to drink more Sider, and many other <IT>English</IT> Drinks, that of late are so Excel&rehy;lent, that they are little inferiour to their VVines (unless in Price) we should then have less occasion for them, and this would be a means to improve the Lands of our own Countrey; And would be a way greatly to advance our National profit and interest. Did we withal but sink the impost of <IT>Portugal</IT> Wine (equal, to <IT>French</IT> Wine) they would take off above 300000 pounds worth of our <IT>English</IT> Manufacture in a year. And then for their Linnens we might promote the making thereof in our own Nation, as shall be shewed hereafter.
</P><P>And for their Silks and other Superfluities that we do buy of them, (which (as some do judge) do amount to more Money then all their Wines and Linnen both) we have little or no occasion of them. And if they were all prohibited, it would mightily advance the Wea&rehy;vers Trade in the Cities of <IT>London</IT> and <IT>Canterbury</IT>.</P></DIV>
<DIV N="VIII" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. VIII. <LB><IT>Concerning the Hindrances of wearing our Woollen Manufacture at home</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>As it is necessary, that this Trade be promoted abroad, so it is as ne&rehy;cessary, that it be promoted as much as may be at home. This Trade is very much hindred by our own People, who do Wear many For&rehy;reign Commodities instead of our own; as may be instanced in many Particulars, <IT>viz.</IT> Instead of Green Sey that was wont to be used for Chil&rehy;drens Frocks, is now used Painted, and <IT>Indian-stained</IT>, and Striped Calico; and instead of a Perpetuana or a Shalloon to Lyne Mens Coats with, is used sometimes a Glazened Calico, which in the whole is not above twelve pence cheaper, and abundantly worse. For either Perpetuana or Shalloon will wear out two Coats, or when it hath worn out one Coat, it will serve for one use or other afterwards for children. And so in reality it is the cheapest. Because Glazened Calico will hardly wear out one Coat: And it is the same or worse, if they Lyne with a plain Calico or Dyed Linnen. And sometimes is used a Bangale that is brought from <IT>India</IT>, both for Lynings to Coats, and for Petticoats <PB
N="17">too; Yet our <IT>English</IT> VVare is better and cheaper then this, only it is thin&rehy;ner for the Summer. And of late there are abundance of Linnen Stuffs, that come from <IT>Hamborough</IT>, and are made to imitate our <IT>Norwich</IT> Stuffs, and many of them have been used for Gownes for VVomen, in&rehy;stead of our own Manufacture. To remedy this, it would be necessary to lay a very high Impost upon all such Commodities as these are, and that no Callicoes, or other sort of Linnen be suffered to be Glazened. There is a certain Necessity, that Womens Garments should be Lyned with plain Callico, yet not so for Mens. Therefore it would be ex&rehy;pedient that a Law were made, that no Person should have his Coat Lyned with any thing but what is made in <IT>England</IT>. And this will not only promote the Woollen Trade, but the Silk-Weavers Trade also, who make many Silken Stuffs as fit for Lyning of Gentlemens Coats, as any that is made in any Countrey whatsoever, and no Person can be offend&rehy;ed at it, because his Majesty, (for the encouragement of the Trade of his own people) is graciously pleased to Wear nothing but what is of the <IT>English</IT> make. The Statute for Burying in Woollen would have been of very good use, had it been executed, which (as it may be sup&rehy;posed) would in all this time have Consumed as much Wooll as there is at this time in <IT>England</IT>. And the way to have it put in execution, is to put the Administrator upon the proof of it. Therefore it would be necessary, that there were a Law made to enjoyn the Person concerned to prove the same upon Oath before some Justice of the Peace, within one Moneth after the Burial, and that he hath a Certificate hereof under the Justice his Hand and Seal: And without this Certificate the Church&rehy;Wardens should forthwith put the penalty of the Law in execution. There is one thing more that would be no small addition to the ad&rehy;vancement of this Trade, and that is to encourage Wearing of Flannel; There are some of the Gentry who have Worn it, do commend it ex&rehy;ceedingly, saying, that it doth Wear as well and as soft, either in Shirts or Shifts, as any Linnen whatsoever. And the courser sort would be better then Linnen for the Poor, because they may Wear it a Moneth without Washing. Now if the People should take to the Wearing of this, it would unspeakably Advance Trade in this Kingdom.</P></DIV>
<PB N="18"><DIV N="IX" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. IX. <LB><IT>Concerning the Causes of Impoverishing the Silk-Weavers Trade</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Nic;OW I have already shewed that the Importing of so many <IT>French</IT> wrought Silken Stuffs into this Kingdom, hath been one way to Im&rehy;poverish this Trade, and that the Prohibition of these Commodities would be very necessary for the benefit hereof; I shall further shew in another place that the Hawking and Retayling of their Commodities are two other means that have also contributed towards the Marring this Trade. But besides these, there are two more, the one is the Engines of late invented, that do Weave only narrow Ribbands, and those so ve&rehy;ry sleight, that if ever Sales-men should be suppressed, they would be of no use at all; and for this Reason the Retayling Shop-keepers can hard&rehy;ly sell any of them. It is then very much against the common and ge&rehy;neral good, that a thing so useless should be suffered; seeing that by this means there will also be many hands of the poor that will want work.
</P><P>Another thing that hath very much empaired this Trade is, that there are here and there a Silk-Weaver or two (of late years) crept into some Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>, who do employ such people that were never bound to the Trade. Now although what I speak of before (concerning License to set up any Trade that doth employ the poor) will hold good in this Trade also: yet in a differing manner, because in all other Trades that do employ the poor, they cannot effect their business with&rehy;out employing such as were never Apprentice to the Trade. As for In&rehy;stance, the Clothier must employ the Spinner and Stockarder, that per&rehy;adventure were never Apprentices to any Trade, else they could never accomplish their end. And it is the same in making of Buttons and Bone&rehy;lace, and the like. But it is not so in this Trade; for they that have been Apprentices to the Silk-weaving Trade, and able to make more Com&rehy;modities then can be easily disposed of. And the reason why there are such multitudes of this Trade is, because there hath not been for a long time any other but this, to place forth poor mens Children, and Parish Boyes unto; by which means the poor of this Trade have been very nu&rehy;merous, who can do nothing else almost, being bred up unto it from their youth. Therefore although it might not be against the common good, for any one to employ their Stocks in setting of these Weavers on <PB
N="19">work; yet it would be so, if either they should be suffered to Weave them&rehy;selves, or should employ any other to Weave for them, that were never Apprentices to the Trade. Therefore it would be necessary that no man of this Trade live alone, and in a private place: But it would be much more for the profit and interest of the Masters of this Trade, that they Cohabit and dwell together in some Eminent City or Town, which they might make not only the Seat of their Habitation, but also the Empori&rehy;um and Seat of their Trade. And if <IT>London</IT> and <IT>Canterbury</IT> cannot con&rehy;tain all of this Trade, then there may be appointed some other place for them to live in.</P>
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> The Reason hereof (besides what is premised) is, because a Market must be one way to Regulate some Abuses in this Trade as well as in others, as shall be shewed at large in another place: Now a man or two in a Town, or two or three in a County, can never make a Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> Because this is a very great injury to the Whole-sale Shop-keepers in <IT>London</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> Because they do prejudice the Retayl Shop-keepers also in those Market-Towns where they do live. For these do many times Retayl their Commodities, and many are furnished by them that never served any Apprentiship to any Shop-keeping Trade.</ITEM></LIST></DIV>
<DIV N="X" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. X. <LB><IT>Concerning the Woollen Manufacturer, and the Silk-Weaver, their Retayl&rehy;ing the Commodities which they make</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Nic;OW neither of these Manufacturers were wont formerly to Retayl what they made; which hath greatly empaired not only their own Trade, but many Shop-keeping Trades too. And if it may be thought that the Shop-keeping Trade is a conveniency to the people of this King&rehy;dom, and for the general good thereof (as <IT>I</IT> shall prove hereafter) then it will not be expedient that the former should be suffered. I have al&rehy;ready shewed what did occasion the Woollen Manufacturer to do this at first, <IT>viz.</IT> The great Abuse they did sustein by the Factors. And that which did at first occasion it in the Silk-Weavers, was their own covetousness. For they thought to advantage themselves by selling their Ware to Countrey Chapmen, which made them go to their Inns in <IT>London</IT> where they sold them their Commodities. Now so soon as the <PB
N="20">Whole-Sale-Men did perceive this, then he did all he could to beat down the Weavers price, that so he might keep his Countrey Chapmen. Hereupon their Commodities were sold far lower then before. Therefore many that could not sell to Countrey Chapmen, fell to Retayling of their Wares which they did make. Yet neither of these Manufacturers did hereby advantage themselves, because for this reason none of the Shop-keepers would buy of them that did Retail, and they not finding sale for their Commodities by Retail, sufficient to maintain them, have been (many of them) hereby Reduced to very great Necessities.
</P><P>Now the Silk-Weavers had no need at all to do this, because they had before a very good price for their Commoditie, and many of them are so sensible hereof, that they do heartily wish that the Trade might be re&rehy;duced again to the same state that it was in formerly.</P>
<P>But to return to the Clothier, who will not have that occasion to Re&rehy;tail his Cloth, if the abuse of the Factors be Rectified. Yet there is one Objection concerning him, and that is this,</P>
<P>Obj. <IT>If he should not Retail his own Cloth, what shall he do with a dam&rehy;maged Cloth, that he cannot sell at a Market</IT>?</P>
<P><IT>Answ.</IT> I Answer, that for all such damaged Cloth, and Remnants of Cloth, that will not pass Sale at the Market, the Clothier should not Retail these until they are Licensed by the Officers of their Company, who should view them, and they find them not fit for the Market, they should License the same Cloth, or Remnant of Cloth, to be Retailed, by putting the Seal of their Company at the end thereof in Wax.</P>
<P>And hereunto may be Added the injury that many Merchants do to the Shop-keeping Trade, by Retailing those Commodities they adven&rehy;ture for. Inasmuch as hereby Trade is brought out of its right Current. And to prevent this mischief it would be necessary, that no Person what&rehy;soever be admitted to Retail any Commodity belonging to the Shop&rehy;keeping Trade of buying and selling, that hath it at the first hand; not but that those Shop-keeping Traders might Retail those Commodities which they make, whose custom hath been to do so time out of minde: Such are the Shoomaker, the Brasier, the Pewterer and the like.</P></DIV>
<PB N="21"><DIV N="XI" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XI. <LB><IT>Concerning Hawkers that do Profer to sell Commodities by Whole-Sale</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Oic;F late years the whole Trade of this Kingdom is to Profer Com&rehy;modities to the Buyer both by Whole-sale and Retail, which hath much Empaired all Trades, because there is a vast difference between <IT>What will you give</IT>? and <IT>What shall I give</IT>? Now I shall first insist upon those that profer their Wares by Whole-sale, which are called Hawkers, and which are not only the Manufacturers themselves, but others besides them, <IT>viz.</IT> the Women in <IT>London</IT>, in <IT>Exceter</IT> and in <IT>Manchester</IT>, who do not only Profer Commodities at the Shops and Ware houses, but also at Inns to Countrey-Chapmen. Likewise the <IT>Manchester</IT>-men, the <IT>Sherborn</IT>-men, and many others, that do Travel from one Market-Town to ano&rehy;ther; And there at some Inn do profer their Wares to sell to the Shop&rehy;keepers of the place.
</P><P>That which did occasion Men at first to Retail those Commodities which they made, did at first occasion this also, and is no less disadvanta&rehy;geous then that was, not only to the Woollen Manufacturers and Silk&rehy;Weavers, but also to all the Shop-keeping Trades in <IT>England</IT>.</P>
<P>Now although at the first taking up of this Hawking way, there were some who did get Estates by it, there being then but few of them, by which means they took much more Money, and stayed for less time in a place, then now they do; but it is quite otherwise at this day, the number of them being much Augmented, by which means they take but little Money, and are forced to tarry long in a place, because Men do not minde their going away; for if one be gone, be sure another will quickly come. Whereupon some have stayed a Fortnight in a Countrey Market&rehy;Town; Nay, some Rug-makers have waited in <IT>London</IT>, absent from all their business at home, almost three Moneths before they could Vend their Wares. And the Charge of Horse-meat and Mans Meat is no less then before; So that by reason of their long abode in a place, it doth cost these more now, then formerly it did them that took six times more money; whereby many of them are quite undone, and the rest that remain, who are sufficient men, are so extreamly wearied with this way of dealing, that they would be heartily glad (as many of them have confessed) if there were a Law to suppress them, that then Trade <PB
N="22"> might return into its old Channel, where it hath ran far better then ever since.</P>
<P>Moreover, this Hawking Trade doth utterly empair the whole-Sale Trade, in all the Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>, but especially in the City of <IT>London</IT>, where are some Trades in a manner come to no&rehy;thing, because Countrey-Chapmen do not buy of them now, scarce an eighth part of what they were wont to buy formerly.</P>
<P>And it is no less injurious to the Retailing Shop-keeping Trade in all Cities and Market Towns in <IT>England</IT>.</P>
<P REND="it">First, because they have been an occasion to many, that never served an Apprentiship to any Shop-keeping Trade, to set up the same, not only in Cities and Market Towns, but also in every Countrey Village.
</P><P REND="it">Secondly, because when they have been Necessitated for Money, (as often they are by reason of their great Expences and their small Trade) to sell their Commodities by Retail, in the several Market-Towns where they have been, and that at as low Rates as they would sell by whole-sale, have hereby greatly imposed upon their Trades and themselves both. <RO>But hence may some raise these Objections following</RO>.
</P><P REND="it"><RO>Obj.1.</RO> If this Hawking Trade by suppressed, what more convenient way can be found, for the Manufacturer to sell his Wares, and also for the Buyer to furnish himself with what he wants.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> There is no better way both for the Manufacturer to sell his Wares, and also for the buyer to furnish himself with what he wants, then at a Market. Of which conveniency I intend to Treat hereafter.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>Obj. 2.</RO> But if Hawkers be suppressed, the Shop-keepers will not have the con&rehy;venience for the buying their Commodities then, as they have now.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> I answer, that most of the Shop-keepers in <IT>England</IT> are so sensible of the great wrong they have received from them, that they had rather Ride a hundred Miles to buy their Commodities, then they should be tolerated.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>Obj. 3.</RO> But if the Hawkers be suppressed, it will not be much the better for the Shop-keepers in Countrey Market-Towns; for then the <RO>Londoners</RO> and others will have Ware-Houses in places in the Countrey, which will be as injurious unto them as the Hawkers have been.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> For the prevention of this mischief to the Trade of the Countrey <PB
N="23">Market-Towns; it would be necessary that all persons were prohibited by a Law to have any Ware-house, or to keep any Factors or Servants to sell Commodities for them in any Market-Town or City in <IT>England</IT>; save only there where they do live with their Family.</P></DIV>
<DIV N="XII" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XII. <LB><IT>Concerning Trades-Men Breaking, and paying so little in the pound of their true Debts</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;His is a third thing that is very prejudicial, not only to the Woollen Manufacturer and Silk-Weaver, but also the Whole-sale Shop-keep&rehy;ing Trade and Merchant. It will be in vain to insist upon what hath been the Practice of many Persons in this Kingdom, concerning their break&rehy;ing and puting themselves into the Kings Bench, paying little or nothing of their just debts; For this is too Notorious to the whole Nation: There are then four things that occasion Mens breaking.</P><LIST
REND="it"><ITEM><LABEL>First,</LABEL> some sudden Contingencies as the Merchant may meet with. Great and sudden losses at Sea; Or the Shop-Keeper may be utterly undone by sud&rehy;den Fire, or the like; In these Cases there ought to be Mercy shewed to such Poor Men; and it is much to be Lamented there is not a Way thought on to Raise Moneys to set them up again.</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>2.</RO></LABEL> The Want of Success. Many a Man doth take a great deal of Care and Pains in his Trade, and yet all will not do, still he goes backward in the World; yet this is not common and usual, for God hath Promised to bless the Hands of the diligent; yet sometimes it may so fall out. However, this man ought to be honest, and to make a Discovery of his Condition in time, lest that he should spend upon other Mens money; and he that is a careful, honest and industrious man must needs know when he is sinking in his Estate.</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>3.</RO></LABEL> Ill Husbandry is another thing that doth occasion men to break; Some will spend their time in Drinking and Gaming, neglecting their business, un&rehy;til they are undone. And such Persons as these are ought to be dealt severely with. For why should they spend the money of other industrious men by their luxurious living.</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL><RO>4.</RO></LABEL> A design of Gain is another thing which doth occasion some men to break. They finde some have Got estates by breaking, and therefore they will do so too. Now we may conclude, that this man doth not deserve less punishment then he that taketh a Purse upon the High-way; for by the reason of this Mans <PB
N="24">pretended honesty he is trusted, but so is not he that Robbeth upon the Road.
</ITEM></LIST><P>I judge therefore it would be of very great use and benefit to the Trade of this Kingdom, if there were a Law made to inflict some bodily punishment upon every one that should break for above one hundred pounds, and should not pay fifteen shillings in the pound of his true and just debts; and thus no man could be so suddenly undone by bad debts: For then men would not lose so much by three hundred pounds, as now they commonly do by two, nay, by one.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>Object.</RO> But many a man hath been brought low in the World, and yet have got up again.</P>
<P><IT>Answ.</IT> Grant there have been some that have got up again, who have not been able to pay full fifteen shillings in the pound. I say, admit there have been such black Swans, yet this is <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">Rara avis in terris</FOREIGN></IT>. -- And these are few in comparison of the many hundreds, who have not risen again after such a fall. Therefore there ought to be a severe Penalty inflicted on these, to compel them to discover their condition before it cometh to be at this rate with them. Besides, this is the more probable way of their Recovery. For hereby they will be out of debt, and their Credi&rehy;tors, by reason they shall lose so little by them, will certainly be the more kinde unto them. 5. I might also add one thing more that is the reason of the breaking of many men, who are of Retailing Trades, or at least of not paying their Creditors so timely as otherwise they might, who might have been Ranked among those mentioned in the first particular, to whom there ought to be shewed much Mercy and Compassion. Such are those Retailers that are encouraged to trust Persons because of their great Estates and Revenues, who do neither take any care, nor make any con&rehy;science of paying their just and true debts; who will keep the Tradesman from his Money, sometimes two or three yeares, although they have been importuned by him, both to his expences and loss of time. And although some will be so fair as to give both good words and Promises, yet these have been but miserable Evasions and Put-offs, as is evident, in that they never minde the Performance of them. But then again, there are others that are so far from giving good words, that they give altogether menaces and threatnings, which have made many a Trades&rehy;man afraid to ask for his own, for fear of a Stab.</P>
<PB N="25"><P>And others there are, that will Pretend the Trades-man hath Cheated them in over-prizing his Commodities, and therefore he must stay longer for his Money, which is another shift. Whereas it is the Trades-man indeed that is cheated, in being forced to stay so long for his Money a&rehy;gainst his Will. For it is impossible that he that shall stay a Twelve&rehy;month for his Money, shall ever inhance the price of his Commodity so far, as to be sufficiently recompensed for staying so long a time for it. All men I think will grant, that if the Trades-man hath ready money, two shillings in the pound is but reasonable. Now then if he doth stay a Twelve-month before he is paid, he should have four shillings profit in the pound, if two years then six shillings in the pound, and so on, accord&rehy;ing to the time he shall stay for his money; because it will easily appear, that more then ten in the hundred profit might be made in a year, with ready money in a Trade. But now it is next to an impossibility for any Trades-man to gain four shillings in the pound, unless it be in some hidden Commodities, such as belong to the Apothecaries; and yet this in rea&rehy;son they ought to have, if they stay a Twelve-month for their Money. And if they can be no Gainer then, what will they be, if they shall stay two or three, nay, four years before they are paid. Assuredly, no man can possibly deny, but in this case a Trades-man must needs be a very great Loser.
</P><P>Further, it often hapneth, that after all this the Trades-man doth lose his whole debt, if it be not paid before the Person is dead, for then the Heir doth Claim the Inheritance, and the Widow her Joincture, and there is nothing left to pay the debts but the Personal Estate, which is seldom more then a Coach and Horses, and some Houshold Goods, which will not pay sometimes a tenth part of the debts. This is quite contrary to what was formerly wont to be. Then the truly Noble Gentlemen of this Kingdom, did esteem it their great honour, to fulfil exactly whatso&rehy;ever they had promised, although it had been never so much to their de&rehy;triment and loss. They would heretofore have disdained those Rig&rehy;lings and Shiftings which are used in our times: insomuch, that if the Trades-man had their Promise, they might more certainly have depend&rehy;ed on it, then now they may on their Bonds. And hence it was, that the Statute of Banquerupt did concern only Trades-man, because all others <PB
N="26">then were punctual to observe and to perform their word, and careful to pay all their just and true debts.</P>
<P>There are two things that probably would Remedy this, if it would not be thought too great a price of Presumption.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>First, the first is this</RO>, viz. That for all debts that are not paid within six Months time or thereabouts, after they are Contracted, the Debtor should af&rehy;terwards be liable to pay the interest; And likewise if any die, whose Personal estate will not reach to pay all their debts, there may be in this Case by a Law Commissioners, that might be Authorised to sell, and dispose of so much of the Land, that was Possessed by the Debtor deceased, that will fully pay all the debts; and certainly this would be of no ill consequence to the Kingdom. For it would not only be a conveniency to Tradesmen, but in all probability might be an inducement to all Persons to take greater care to live within the Compass of their Estates.</P></DIV>

For were it not for these, there would be a&rehy;bundance more Cloth and Stuff, and trimming of Suites used and worn out, then now there is. And they do not only wrong these Trades, but many others also, as the Tailor, the Hatter, the Sadler, the Shooe&rehy;maker and the Tanner; for, were it not for these Coaches, there would be far more of the Commodities used and vended then now there are. And they do not a little incommode all the Innes in all the Cities and Market-towns in <IT>England</IT>; for where are no Coaches frequenting the Innes, they have there little (if any thing) to do; and they who have them get no such advantage by them, being forced to take such under Rates for their Horse-meat, that the loss they thereby sustein, is greater then can be regained by the Guests which those Coaches do bring unto their Innes; and then the Owners of them do receive so little benefit, that many of late years have been utterly undone by them. And then they carry multitudes of Letters, which otherwise would be sent by the Post; And were it not for them there would be more Wine, Beer and <PB
N="27">Ale drank in the Inn then is now, which would be a means to Augment the Kings Custom and Excise; Furthermore, they hinder the Breed of Horses in this Kingdom, because many would be necessitated to keep a good Horse that now keeps none. Now seeing there are few that are Gainers by them, and that they are against the common and general good of this Nation, and is only a conveniency to some that have occasion to go to <IT>London</IT>, who might still have the same wayes, as before these Coaches were in use, (which hath not been much above twenty years) therefore there is good reason they should be suppressed. Not but that it may be lawful also to Hire a Coach upon occasion; but that it should be unlawful only to keep a Coach that should go long Journeys con&rehy;stantly, from one stage or place to another upon certain days of the Week, as they now do. And since I am speaking of the Innes, I shall relate one thing more that doth greatly incommode them, which is the great num&rehy;ber of Ale-houses that are suffered in all Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>, in one of which is more Beer drawn, then in many Innes that pay six times the Rent that they do. Besides, there are many poor men who do spend both their time and money in them, whilst their Wives and Children are ready to starve at home. And then, if so many were not suffered to run into this way, they would (it may be) get into some o&rehy;ther, which might be more for the general good of this Kingdom, such as the making of Linnen Cloth, Bone Lace, or the like.
</P><P>Furthermore, the Innes are a great conveniency, common to the whole Nation, being necessary for the Refreshing of wearied Travellers, and so ought to be encouraged. Besides, they pay great Rents to many Gentlemen in this Kingdom, which must inevitably fall, if they meet with such discouragements as these are. Now seeing it doth appear by what hath been said, that so many Alehouses are no way at all beneficial to the publick good, but many ways injurious to the same, then there is reason to suppress them; and I conceive there would be little less of Beer and Ale drank then now there is; for all sufficient men that can bear the expence of their money and time, would then frequent the Innes upon all occasions, as now they do the Alehouses.</P></DIV>
<PB N="28"><DIV N="XIV" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XIV. <LB><IT>Concerning the Shop-keeping Trades in this Kingdom</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;HAT which hath been the Bane almost of all Trades, is the too great number of Shop-keepers in this Kingdom. For as it is Related by Mr. <IT>Coke</IT>, in a Treatise of his concerning Trade, that there are ten thou&rehy;sand Retailing Shop-keepers more in <IT>London</IT> then are in <IT>Amsterdam</IT>.
</P><P>Now the reason hereof is, First, <IT>Because for many yeares there have been no other Trades but these to receive the Youth of this Nation</IT>. For&rehy;merly, when the Cloathing Trade did flourish with us, there were many sufficient Mens Sons put Apprentices to this Trade. Secondly, <IT>Because the Shop-keeping Trade is an easie life, and thence many are induced to run into it, and there hath been no Law to prevent it; or if there by any, it hath been very slackly executed, which maketh very many (like a mighty Torrent) fall into it, which hath been Verified for several years past, by many Hus&rehy;bandmen, Labourers and Artificers, who have left off their Working Trades, and turned Shop-keepers</IT>.</P>
<P>And of <IT>Quakers</IT>, great Numbers of late years are become Shop-keep&rehy;ers; for if a man that hath been very meanly bred, and was never worth much above a Groat in all his life, do but turn <IT>Quaker</IT>, he is presently set up in one Shop keeping Trade or other, and then many of them will Com&rehy;pass Sea and Land to get this New-Quaking Shop-keeper a Trade; And if he be of a Trade that no other <IT>Quaker</IT> is of in the Town or Village, then he shall take all their money which they have occasion to lay out and expend in his way, their Custom being to sell to all the World, but they will buy only of their own Tribe. Insomuch, that it is conceived by some wise men, that they will in a short time engross the whole Trade of the Kingdom into their hands.</P>
<P>And then again, there are some of the Silk-weavers, but more the Clothiers, that deal in as many if not in far more Commodities then any shop keeper doth, that hath been Apprentice to his Trade; for they sell not only the Cloth that they make, but Stuffs, Linnen and many other things; and have such wayes to put off their Commodities which the Shop-keeper hath not; for they will Truck them off for Shooes with <PB
N="29">the Shoomaker, for Candles with the Chandler, and sometimes with the Butcher for Meat, and will make their Work-folks to take the same for their Work, (although there be an express Statute against it) and then these Work-folks will sell the same again for Money, to buy such Necessaries which they want.</P>
<P>And it is not much better with them of the City of <IT>London</IT>, for there are many that do live in a Chamber, that do take twice as much Money as many Shop keepers do, who pay four times the Rent that they do, so that it cannot be imagined what an unnumerable Company of Shop-keepers are in every place; and such Practices as these have utterly empaired all Shop-keeping Trades in this Kingdom, which are Grie&rehy;vances never suffered in former times, being against the common good of the People of this Nation; And its desired they were speedily Redressed for these following Reasons.</P>
<P REND="it">First, Because the Shop-keeping Trade is both a convenient and easie Way for the Gentry, Clergy and Communalty of this Kingdom, to Provide for their younger Sons, that so the Bulk of their Estates may go to the Eldest. For there are few younger Sons, who are Trades-men, that have much above one years Revenue of their Fathers Estate for their Patrimony. Now these being kept close to business in the time of their youth, do many of them come to be sober and industrious men; and with this small Portion to live a little Answerable to the Family from whence they descended, being serviceable in their Generation both to their King and Countrey, and many times keep up the Name and Grandeur of their Family, when their Eldest Brother by his vi&rehy;tious and intemperate Life hath lost it. And oftentimes it proveth Advan&rehy;tageous to their Daughers too; for it doth frequently happen, when the Gen&rehy;try die, that they leave but small Portions to their Daughters, scarce sufficient to Prefer them to Gentlemen of great Revenues, (Parallel'd to their Fami&rehy;lies) yet nevertheless may be thought worthy and deserving of Trades-men, who are the younger sons of Gentlemen, and by their Matching with such as these, do come to live a little suitably to their Birth and Breeding.
</P><P>Indeed the Innes of Court and the Universities, must be acknowledg&rehy;ed to be both of them Places fit for the Preferment of younger sons; but every one hath not a <IT>Genius</IT> capable of Learning those Noble (yet ab<PB
N="30">struse) Sciences, there taught and profest, who notwithstanding are ca&rehy;pable enough of a Shop-keeping Trade. Besides, if every one were fit for either of these, yet they would not suffice to receive a third part even of this sort of youth, and then what should be done with the rest? Should they be brought up to no Employment? but be left to the <CORR
SIC="Ex&rehy;travigancy">Ex&rehy;travagancy</CORR> of their youthful lusts, to commit such impieties and de&rehy;bautcheries which may justly entitle them to the Compellations given by <IT>Augustus C&aelig;sar</IT> to his leud Children, <IT>viz. To be Called the Botches and Biles of their Family</IT>? As it is observable in those Countreys where the Gentry disdain to place forth their Children to Trades, who therefore turn very dissolute and vitious, and no way serviceable (in times of Peace) in their Generation, either to their King or Countrey where they live.</P>
<P REND="it">Secondly, because Shop keepers by Reason of their Education, were never used to labour, and should their Trades be destroyed by these meanes. they will not know how to maintain themselves and their Families; but they that have been bred to work, may labour in any other Employment, if that to which they have been bred will not maintain them.
</P><P REND="it">Thirdly, Because this hath Rendred the Shop-keeping Trade to be unpro&rehy;fitable, like unto many unstinted Commons that no body is the better for. Now where there is no Order or Rule there must be Confusion; as it is in Trades a this time. And yet there is Order and Rule observed in other Vocations, and why not so in this? <RO>The Minister must not Preach until he is Ordained; The Lawyer must not Plead before he is Called to the Barr; the <CORR
SIC="Chy&rehy;ragion">Chirurgeon</CORR> must not Practice before he hath his License; Neither can the Midwife Practise before she hath her License too</RO>: And therefore why should any set up a Shop-keeping Trade, before they have been made free of the same.
</P><P>This is one Reason why so few Apprentices, after they come out of their time, do get into the World, or can make any benefit of their Trades. Wherefore it concerneth all whatsoever, whether Gentlemen or Clergy-men, to be very solicitous for the Preservation of this way of life, which is so conducing to the Preferment of their Children.</P>
<P REND="it">Fourthly, because it will Cost a round Sum of Money, before a Child can <PB
N="31">be setled in any Shop-keeping Trade. First, To breed him at school and to make him fit for the same. Secondly, To place him forth to the said Trade when he is fit: Which will cost in a Countrey Market-Town, not less then fifty or sixty pounds, but in <RO>London</RO> upwards of an hundred; so that these Trades do seem to be purchased, and that not only with Money by the Parents, but with a Servitude also by the Son.
</P><P>Therefore as I conceive, they ought to have the properties of their Trades confirmed unto them, even as other men have the properties of their Lands confirmed unto them: That is, that no Person do set up any Shop-keeping Trade, unless they be made Free of the same. And if any should plead, that it might be lawful for one man to use anothers Land as his own for a Livelyhood, he would presently be accounted a Leveller and a Ridiculous Fellow: And certainly no less can he be accounted, that should argue it might be lawful for one man to use anothers Trade. For this Trade is bought with the Parents Money, and the Sons Servi&rehy;tude, and intended for a future Livelihood for the Son in the same man&rehy;ner as Land is bought by the Father, and setled upon the Child for his fu&rehy;ture Livelihood and comfortable subsistence.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>Object</RO>. But it may be Objected by many, that a restraint herein doth hinder Ingeniousness, the end of that liberty hitherto im&rehy;pleaded.</P>
<P><IT>Answ.</IT> I answer, the end by these opposers chiefly intended, is herein altogether frustrated, <IT>viz.</IT> A further improvement of the Shop-keeping Trade, which (beyond controversy) cannot be more improved then it is already, and therefore an uncontrouled liberty of undertaking these Trades upon this account, doth (as I conceive) rather pervert the opera&rehy;tions of a pregnant Wit and lively Phantasie, which might be better ex&rehy;erted in other employments, that are fitter subjects thereof, yet abundant&rehy;ly more conducing to the publick good; such are Mechanick Trades, and others, (that may set the Poor more on work) by inventing Artifices and wayes for the making such Commodities here, which are now bought beyond Sea, and brought to us from thence, where they are made. But I fear any thing of so good consequence <PB
N="32">will scarce be effected, whilest this Liberty of turning Shop-keepers is permitted to all Persons promiscuously. Indeed the Parliament made an Act to encourage the Making of Linnen Cloth, but for this Reason there are few or none who have Medled with it.</P>
<P REND="it"><RO>Obj. 2.</RO> But some may say, should the Gentry be encouraged to put their younger Sons to Trades, it might have a bad Aspect on the Safety and Weal of the Kingdom, as may appear from the benefit the <RO>French</RO> receive by a con&rehy;trary Practice, who instead of making them Apprentices, invite them to the Camp, by which means the <RO>French</RO> King hath alwayes multitudes of brave Souldiers, both for Valour and Conduct.
</P><P><IT>Answ.</IT> I grant, that if the <IT>French</IT> had not this way, they would ne&rehy;ver have an Army of any Note for Prowess and Courage, but would be as faint-hearted and low-spirited as Women; Neither could they have Alarm'd all <IT>Christendom</IT>, as of late. The Reason is this, there are in <IT>France</IT> but two sorts of People, <IT>viz.</IT> The High Gentry, and the poor Peasant; Now these latter are alwayes Enslaved by the former, and thereby so much dis-spirited, that they seldom prove stout and reso&rehy;lute Souldiers. And hence it is, that they have not had one Pitched Battel in all the time of the late Warres; but on the other hand the <IT>English</IT> are of better Metal, for whilest they are well paid, and preferred according to their Merits, there will be in them no want either of Courage or Conduct. As may appear by the late unhapy Warres, where there were many, and some of them but of a very mean Extraction, that were as Eminent both for Courage and Skill in Mili&rehy;tary Discipline as any sort or degree of Men whatsoever. But this is al&rehy;togher destructive in the Time of Peace and Tranquility, which is most for the good of Mankinde, and chiefly to be desired. For so many younger Brothers being out of all Employment for a Livelihood, do occasion great Mischief to a Countrey, either by Robbing, or by Insurrections, (which is worse,) and therefore the <IT>French</IT> King is al&rehy;ways engaged in VVars, either Intestine or Foreign.</P>
<PB N="33"><P>And it would be worse with us than it is with them, because the middle men of this Kingdom have plenty of children, and so have the Clergy, and were it not for the conveniency of trade to dispose of them, it would be impossible but that there would be great confusion. Now in <IT>France</IT> there are no middle sort of men to have children, and the Clergy have none, at least that they care for owning; so that it is manifest to all, by these reasons before pre&rehy;mised, that it is much against the general good of this Nation, that such liberty shou'd be permitted in the Shopkeeping Tade as now there is. But what way may be thought of to remedy the same? Now to this end I shall suggest some particulars that may be e&rehy;steem'd necessary; first for the setling of a right order herein, and afterwards for continuing the same when once established. For the setling of the Shopkeeping trade,
</P><LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> It would be necessary that all persons do prove (before some appointed for that end) that either they have been Shop-keepers fifteen or twenty years, or that they have been Apprentices to some Shopkeeping trade of buying and selling, and not to a working Shopkeeping trade, as is a Shoomaker, a Pewterer, or the like; nei&rehy;ther would it be necessary, the Son should be of any such trade, unless it could be proved, that the Father had served an appren&rehy;tiship to the same. So that if the Father be free only of a working trade, the Son also should be free only of the same; unless he hath served apprentiship to another trade and master; yet with this ca&rehy;veat, that there be not too great strictness used in this proof; be&rehy;cause many men that have truly served their apprentiship, may have lost their Indentures, or their masters may be dead; there&rehy;fore if any person concern'd can bring any one that will swear, that he did know, and was familiarly acquainted with the said appren&rehy;tice, at the latter end of his time, when he lived with such a one as his reputed apprentice, and that he never did hear or know any thing to the contrary, but that the said person did serve out his full time, that then this proof should be sufficient.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL><SIC>3.</SIC></LABEL> That upon this proof, the party concern'd should have a <PB
N="34">certificate of his freedom of the particular trade that he is free of; but without this proof and this certificate no person should be per&rehy;mitted to keep any wares in any Shop or Warehouse, or be of any Shopkeeping trade whatsoever.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>4.</LABEL> That in all the Cities and Market Towns in <IT>England</IT>, the Shopkeepers do all they can at the first setling of Trades to di&rehy;stinguish the same, as much as may be one from another. It is true, custom formeth Trades, and in some few places, they are hereby very well distinguished already; yet in many places they are not. And although every trade cannot be distinguished as they are in <IT>London</IT>, yet in many places, they may come near it, especially in some eminent Cities, and Market towns, as <IT>Oxford, Salisbury, Northampton</IT>, and the like; and we may instance farther in <IT>Marlborough</IT>, a little Town, (in comparison of these) where they al&rehy;most have this distinction, and live better upon their Trades than they do in more noted places, where their trades are not so distinct: for in these latter, many Shop-keepers do not get so much by their trades, as some Workmen do by their labour; the reason is clear; for if a man hath not a very great stock he can&rehy;not be sufficiently furnished with the commodities belonging to so many Trades. Yet there are few places of eminency, but may admit of these Trades as several and distinct, <IT>viz.</IT> A wool&rehy;len Draper, a Linnen Draper, a Mercer that may also sell all sorts of Silver and Gold Lace, and silks and butons, and all other silken wares that are for trimming either to mens or womens cloths; a Milliner, who should not be suffered to cut any wrought silks as the Mercers do, but only to sell them in Hoods and Scarfs ready made; the Semsterer, who should also sell Linnen only in things ready made; the Upholsterer, the Ironmonger, the Book&rehy;seller, the Apothecary, the Grocer, and the Chandler, who might sell Bacon and Eggs, Butter and Cheese, Oat-meal, and Salt, Fish and Fowl, Poultrey, and Rabbets, Mustard, and Verjuice, Hops, Brooms, Maps and Brushes. I have named all the Commodi&rehy;ties that may belong to this trade, because I find it in no place <PB
N="35">distinguished, and which would in most places be a good Trade. The Tallow Chandler, who might not only make and sell Tallow Candles, but Wax Candles also and Torches, who might sell all sorts of Glasses, and Bottles, Crochery and Earthen ware. The Haberdasher of Hats, in regard that Women of late years do not so commonly wear Hats as they were wont formerly, may be al&rehy;lowed to make their Hats, and so may their Trade be as good as most Shopkeeping working trades. The Bakers trade would be much bettered, if none but they were permitted to retail Meal, and that they did retail also all sorts of Grain. And when trade is once distinguished, it would be necessary to perserve it so; which must be by hindring others to deal in such commodities that do proper&rehy;ly appertain to another trade. This would be a very great advan&rehy;tage to young men, that have but stock enough to compass one trade, and none can in reason be against it; save only some o&rehy;vergrown Tradesmen, that have stock enough to engrose many Trades.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL>5.</LABEL> That all Apprentices who are now in that condition should have their Indentures register'd, that it might be known what trade every one is bound to, and how long they have to serve of their time.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL><SIC>2.</SIC></LABEL> And to the end that this good order may continue in the Shop&rehy;keeping trade, and that there might be other things thought of for the regulating the same, it would be necessary that all Trades were in companies; of the great conveniency whereof I do intend to treat at the latter end of this Book.</ITEM></LIST>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But if no person should be permitted to sell any commodity that belongeth to the Shopkeeping Trade, but Shopkeepers only, then what shall the Clothier do with such commodities that he receiveth in truck for his Cloth.</P>
<P><IT>An.</IT> If the Clothier be convenienced in selling his Cloth, then he will not be so much expos'd to ruck it as he was before; but how&rehy;ever, if he do at any time truck his Cloth for any of the Shop&rehy;keepers commodities, that then it should be lawful for him to <PB
N="36">sell the same in gross, and by whose sale, to those that are of the Shopkeeping trade, but not to buy and sell it as the Shop&rehy;keeper doth.</P>
&horbar;</DIV>
<DIV N="XV" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XV. <LB><IT>Concerning Taylers and others being Sales-men</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;His is another thing that doth add to the great number of Shopkeepers, which was never wont to be formerly; for al&rehy;though a Merchant-Tayler is a very ancient Trade; yet, it is sup&rehy;pos'd that either they themselves did transport those garments that they made, for which reason they were call'd Merchants, as well as Taylers; or else they sold many Garments together, by whole sale to them that did transport them; but not one single Garment at a time, as now our sales-men do; for if so, then there would have been many of this Trade in <IT>London</IT>, long before the memory of any man now living; but its far otherwise, for ma&rehy;ny remember when there were no new Garments sold in <IT>London</IT>, as now there are, only old Garments at second hand.
</P><P>Now this new Trade hath spoiled many other Trades, but e&rehy;specially the Woollen Draper, and the Mercer, which were for&rehy;merly such Trades, that the most sufficient men in the Kingdom did place their sons unto; and the Tayler they have also spoiled, which was, and which would be again, a far better trade than the Sales-man is now if they were suppressed; which is as uncer&rehy;tain a trade as any is in the Kingdom; and there be more that do fail in this trade, than in any other <CORR
SIC="whatsover">whatsoever</CORR>, that makes all men very cautious to trust them. And the reason hereof is; <LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> Be&rehy;cause they are obnoxious to loose not only by old fashion stuffs but by old fashion Garments too.
</ITEM><LB><ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> Because many of them set up with little or no Stocks, that they are often forced to sell for little or no profit; nay sometimes to loss, for ready Money to answer their Creditors.</ITEM></LIST></P>
<PB N="37"><P><IT>Obj.</IT> But Garments bought of them are abundantly cheaper than those bought at the Shops, and made up by accustomed Tay&rehy;lers, as they are called.
</P><P><IT>Sol.</IT> This is so in appearance only, and not in reality; for should they work up their sale Garments with as good Cloth, or Stuff, as is bought at the Shops, and put in as good Linings, and bestow as much workmanship therein, as the customed Tay&rehy;lers do, then they could not be cheaper. But the reason that they appear so cheap, is, because the stuff they use in the sale Garments, is so very sleight, that no body would buy the same in the Shop; and because the Linings are very ordinary, being often taken out of old Garments: and farther, they make up that in a day, that the customed Tayler doth not make up in four days at the least.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> I know there are some that will say that they do buy their Commodities cheaper than the Shopkeepers do, and therefore it is that they do sell cheaper.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> But this is a very great mistake; for there are no men that do generally buy their wares worse than they, and that for those reasons before premised.</P>
<P>But admit that they did sell cheaper (which as I say in reality they do not) yet they are a great hinderance to the common and general good of this Kingdom which should be chiefly prefered, for hereby is lost a greater conveniency than is gained by it; <IT>viz.</IT> three substantial Trades for the preferment of the Youth of the Nation, for one that is not near so good, as the meanest of the three, if this were away. For admit that a Gentleman of four or five hundred pounds a year, should save twenty or thirty Shil&rehy;lings a year, by his buying of the Sales man, (which as I con&rehy;ceive, might be the most that any such person can save by it) yet they cannot be so great a benefit to him as is the conveniency of two substantial Trades for the preferment of his younger Chil&rehy;dren; so that it will consist with good reason to suppress them, see&rehy;ing they are so injurious to the common good of this Kingdom. And few of them would be prejudiced by it, because most of them <PB
N="38">are Taylers, and so they may be still, and others that are not so, may be permitted to take up any other trade that they mangage.</P>

<DIV N="XVI" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XVI. <LB><IT>Concerning Pedlers, and petty Chapmen</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;Hese are such that do proffer wares to sale by retail either by crying it in Cities and Market Town, or by offer&rehy;ing it from door to door all about the Countrey, and which do greatly add to the number of Shopkeepers; for they carry their Shops at their backs, and do sell more that way, than many Shop&rehy;keepers do in their Shops, which is not only a prejudice unto them, but (if they are suffered) will (in time) be the utter ruin of all the Cities and Market Towns in <IT>England</IT>, for of late there is not any commodity to be named, and that can be any way ported, but that the Pedler doth carry all about the Countrey to sell; that people (after a while) will have little or no occasion to come to the Cities and Market Towns for any thing. This also was not wont to be formerly, and ought not to be now, as will appear if it be considered how much in these following particulars, the Shop&rehy;keepers are beneficial to the Common-wealth of this Kingdom; and hin how few of these the Pedlers are beneficial unto the same.
</P><LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> The Shop-keepers do bear a very great proportion in all the Taxes of this Kingdom, whether Parochial or National; but the Pedlers do pay little or no Taxes at all: and if in this great Tax that is expected to come forth this Sessions of Parliament, they were to bear no more proportion thereof than the Pedlers, it may be queried where it might be so easily gathered.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> The Shopkeepers do bear likewise all manner of offices, whe&rehy;ther Parochial, or National, which are very expensive unto them; but Pedlers bear no offices at all.</ITEM>
<PB N="39"><ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> The Shop-keepers do pay great Rents for the houses that they live in, which are more certain Rents to the Gentry than their Lands; but the Pedlers pay little or no Rent at all, for most of them do lie in Barns. And if the Rents should fall in Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>, as they do in most places, especi&rehy;ally in the City of <IT>London</IT>, they are never like to be rais'd again by Pedlers.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL>4.</LABEL> The Shop-keepers do keep good houses, and do relieve the poor at their doors, spending abundance of meat, and other of the Farmers commodities in their families, for which they do al&rehy;ways pay ready money; but the Pedlers are so far from being be&rehy;neficial to the Common-wealth in this particular, that they are bur&rehy;thensome unto the same; for they beg the most part of their Vic&rehy;tuals, and the Countrey people (when the men are in the Field, and there hath been none at home, but Women and Children) have been forced to relieve them for fear of being mischiefed by them.
</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL>5.</LABEL> They and their families do wear out abundance of Cloths, which doth promote the trade of the Nation, but it is very little advance of any trade that the Pedlers do make herein, for their Cloths do differ little from Beggars; and did they wear better, yet they could not wear out much, because few of them have Fa&rehy;milies to do it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>6.</LABEL> The Shop-keepers Trade is esteemed creditable enough, for the preferment of the best mens sons in the Kingdom, next unto the Nobility, but so is not the Pedlers trade; for surely sufficient men would disdain to have their sons Pedlers, and to wander a&rehy;bout the Countrey like Vagabond Rogues as they do.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P><LABEL>7.</LABEL> The Shop-keepers being sufficient mens sons, and being so&rehy;berly, and religiously educated, they come to have (for the most part of them) such principles in them, that they detest to use any indirect way in their dealings. And if they had not this inward principle, yet the consideration how Prejudicial any such thing would be unto them in their Trades by reason of their fixed ha<PB
N="40">bitations, doth make them to do <CORR SIC="thar">that</CORR> which is right and just in their dealings. But neither of these can rationally sway the Ped&rehy;lers, because their education usually is very base and vile, being (for the most part of them) wanderers from their youth, an im&rehy;ployment that few sober men do meddle with, so that no man knows whether they have any principle of Religion, yea or no, for it is seldom that any of them, are ever seen at any Church what&rehy;soever: and then they being Wanderers, makes them bold to use any indirect ways in their dealing, when they have an oppertu&rehy;nity; for when they have done, and taken their money, away they are gone into another Country, and are seen no more in that place.
</P><P>And this is the reason that they do often sell one thing for a&rehy;nother, as Callico for Holland, and do sell that by the yard, that is usually sold by the ell, and do often make less than measure, ex&rehy;treamly, cheating the ignorant Country people in the price of their commodities by their asking sometimes three times the price more than they can afford them.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>8.</LABEL> And as the Shop keepers are seldom guilty of any indirect ways in their dealings; so much less are they at any time guilty of any fellonious actions. But this cannot be said of the Pedlers, who very often are arraigned at the Bar for breaking open of houses, or such like things as these are, having by reason of their selling of Wares, access to all mens houses, and so do know the weakest part of every mans house; and if they are not actors herein themselves, yet they are able to inform any other person, who hath a mind to do it, which (doubtless) they do, as hath been acknowledged by some that have been arraigned for this thing; and then they are the receivers of all the stollen Goods, both of the Town, and the Country. Sometimes that which is stollen from Shop keepers in Market Towns upon their Market, and Fair days when they are busy; and sometimes that which is stollen from Country people, when their Linnen is hanged abroad to dry upon Hedges or other convenient places.</ITEM></LIST>
<PB N="41"><P>I shall not insist upon shewing wherein it is that they are prejudicial to the Shop-keepers, for this is obvious to every man alrea&rehy;dy, how they do come into any place where the Shop-keepers Trade doth lie, and there do take most the ready money of their customers, whilst Shop-keepers commodities lie by them, and braid at home. And by this means they sell but little, (unless any one do want to be trusted) for they seek no further than their Shops for a trade, depending upon the people that shall come unto them, that do live within six or seven miles of the Town where they do live.
</P><P>I might add many other arguments for the suppressing of them, were not these (already mentioned) sufficient.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But many will say that they do sell cheaper than the Shop&rehy;keepers will, because either they do buy their commodities cheaper, or else they do steal the customs, and so may afford them cheaper.</P>
<P><IT>Ans.</IT> This is impossible, except they be such commodities that have been stollen; for no man reasonably can apprehend, but that the Merchants will sell as cheap to the Shop-keepers as they will to the Pedlers; because if at any time they do want their money, they do know where to find the Shop-keeper, both him and his estate; but so they do not the wandring Pedler, neither him nor his estate. And then I suppose their stealing of custom will be no argument for their toleration.</P>
<P>Now if the Shop-keepers do buy as cheap, then they will sell as cheap as they; and there is no Shop-keeper whatsoever, <CORR
SIC="but but">but</CORR> will sell any such commodity that the Pedlers do sell, for a peny in the shilling or two shillings in the pound profit for ready money; and if they do sell for less profit, it can hardly be dis&rehy;cerned by the buyer: And if they shall sell their commodities for less than it cost them, this can be no argument for their toleration; because hereby they may impoverish those persons that they do deal with, as already they have, and such that have been reputed to be with 20000<IT>l.</IT></P>
<PB N="42"><P><IT>Obj.</IT> But should they be suppressed, what shall so many thou&rehy;sands of them do for a livelihood?
</P><P><IT>Sol.</IT> That for those that are Scotch-men, it doth little concern us, they being people of another Countrey: And for those that are English-men, there are few of them but were Labourers before they were Pedlers, and so they may be again, should they be sup&rehy;pressed. There are two more objections which I refer with their answers to the next Sect.</P>
<P>As touching the way whereby to suppress these sort of men, I deem there need no other than the Law that is already in force, only it would add more strength to the Law, if the Statute of the 39<IT>th</IT> of the late Queen <IT>Eliz.</IT> were interpreted by the Parliament, to be meant of all persons whatsoever that should either cry the selling any wares in any City or Market-Town, except victuals on&rehy;ly, or that shall wander about the Countrey, offering their wares to sell at the several places where they shall come.</P>

<P>&Tic;His is another thing that (as well as Pedlers) doth great&rehy;ly increase and add to the number of Shop-keepers, and doth likewise contribute towards the ruining of the Cities and Market&rehy;Towns in <CORR
SIC="Englaad"><IT>England</IT></CORR>, and which was never wont to be formerly; for now in every Country-Village where is (it may be) not above ten houses, there is a Shop-keeper, and one that never served any Apprenticeship to any Shop keeping Trade whatsoever; and ma&rehy;ny of those are not such, that do deal only in pins or such small wares, but such that deal in as many substantial commodities as any do that live in Cities and Market-Towns, who have not less than 1000<IT>l.</IT> worth of Goods in their Shops, for which they pay not once farthing of any Tax at all either Parochial or National.
<PB N="43"></P><P>Certainly all men must needs apprehend, that if this, and Ped&rehy;lers be suffered, that Cities and Market-Towns must needs be im&rehy;poverished, because then there will be little occasion (I say) to bring the Countrey people to them, the which hath happen'd in a very great measure already; for in some places there is not a fifth part of the money taken by the Shop keepers as was formerly, and in many places not half, and in some particular trades there is (as may be made appear) 25000<IT>l.</IT> stock made use of less than there was heretofore. And there are these several reasons following, why it is necessary that Market-Towns and Cities should be en&rehy;couraged and upheld in their trades.</P><LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> Because the people that do live in Cities and Market-Towns, do depend wholly upon a trade for the maintenance both of them&rehy;selves and their families: And if their trade be taken from them by such waies as these are, they will be at a very great loss to know what to do, because they were never bred to any thing else; yet so it is not with those that deal in Villages, who have been bred in some other way. And they have, or may have some other way of living besides the Shop-keeping trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> Because if Cities and Market-Towns be impoverished, then the general part of the people of this Kingdom will lose that ne&rehy;cessary conveniency before mentioned for the preferment of their children. And this is one reason that when many Parents have been at great charge in placing forth their children to trades in Cities and Market-Towns, and the children have faithfully served out their full time, that after all, they are but little the better for it, because Pedlers, and Shop-keepers in Villages, such that never served any Apprenticeship to any Shop-keeping trade, do inter&rehy;cept a very great part of the trade from <CORR
SIC="comiug">coming</CORR> to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> This will be a great means to depopulate not only the Cities and Market Towns, but also the whole Kingdom; for when men can find little or no incouragement in their trades, then they will endeavour to transplant themselves into other Countries, where they may have better incouragement, by which means we shall <PB
N="44">lose our people; whereas (in the opinion of many wise men) we do already want more people in <IT>England</IT> than now we have: there being very great numbers that have gone, not only into our own Plantations, but into <IT>Holland</IT>, and setled there.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>4.</LABEL> If Cities and Market-Towns be impoverished and depopula&rehy;ted, then there will not be raised out of them that proportion of all manner of Taxes as now there is; so that the burthen hereof will be the heavier upon lands and revenues in the Countrey. And it will be a very great diminution of all those standing taxes, that the Cities and Market-Towns do bear the only, or at least the greatest proportion, as they do in the excise of Beer and Ale, for little is gathered any where else: And the Farmers of the Excise are alwaies sensible of the ebbing and flowing of trade, whose Excise doth ebb and flow accordingly. And then if Cities and Market-Towns grow poor, the Chimney-money will never increase thereby. The gatherers of this Tax are able to give an account what multitudes of Paupers are exempted by certificates in Cities and Market-Towns in <IT>England</IT>; and yet notwithstanding there be many do pay, who had need also be exempted.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>5.</LABEL> If Cities and Market-Towns be impoverished, and depopu&rehy;lated of their wealthy and rich inhabitants for want of trade, the great and numerous poor that are in most of them will want to be relieved, which is a burthen that doth lie very heavy upon them already; for in some Market-Towns there are many that are not worth much above a hundred pound stock, which do not pay less than ten shillings a year towards the relief of the poor; which is such a burthen, that if it lay upon the Countrey Farmer, it would much weaken him in the paying of his rent. Now if the poor should not be relieved, what can be expected, but that swarms of them would go into the Country for relief, as already they do in many places? And when the ruder sort cannot get enough by beg&rehy;ging, they will by pilfering and stealing. So that the considera&rehy;tion of these poor, and the many younger Brothers that will be out of any way of living, with the like contingencies, will admi<PB
N="45">nister just occasion to any wise and intelligent person, easily to pre&rehy;sage the misfortunes and miseries that will hereupon necessarily ensue throughout this Kingdom.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>6.</LABEL> If Cities and Market-Towns be impoverished and depopula&rehy;ted for want of a trade, then what will the Countrey-man do to have money for all his commodities, as his Butter, his Cheese, his Cattel, his Wooll, his Corn, and his Fruit? the Shop-keepers in the Countrey Villages will yield but little help in this case, and the Pedlers much less. It is manifest, that the people living in Cities and Market-Towns, consume all these commodities of the Farmers, and do help them to ready money for the same; by which means they have wherewith to pay their rent, and serve their other occa&rehy;sions; and it is impossible for them to subsist but by this way. So that in all reason this kindness ought to be reciprocal, and when it is so, it is the better for both; for it cannot be supposed that trades&rehy;men in Cities and Market-Towns should ever hold out, to buy the Farmers commodities, and help them constantly to money for them, if they should alwaies go home, and lay out little or no part thereof again with them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>7.</LABEL> If Cities and Market-Towns be impoverished and depopula&rehy;ted for want of Trade, the Kingdom may then be obnoxious to its enemies upon all occasions: For these use to be the fences and bulwarks of a Countrey, insomuch that in some other Countries they are so far from admitting of Trades-men to live in Villages, that their Gentry do not live there, but in the great Cities and Towns; by which means they have greater Towns than we gene&rehy;rally have; and most of their Towns are walled, and so are not only able to resist an enemy, but also upon all occasions to succour and save those that shall fly unto them.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>Furthermore, the Kings of <IT>England</IT> have been alwaies furnished with men for their Wars out of the Cities and Market-Towns of this Kingdom; and the greater trade there is in any place, the more people commonly there are in that place: Therefore it con&rehy;cerns this Kingdom to have Trade promoted and encouraged in Ci<PB
N="46">ties and Market-Towns, that so we might have people enough at all times to resist an enemy that shall oppose us. Besides, poor and beggerly Cities and Market-Towns are a very great disparage&rehy;ment to a Country, but the contrary is a great honour: For what more graceful to a Kingdom than the many rich and wealthy Cities and Towns therein? for this reason, as well as for all those already mentioned, all persons that are of publick spirits, should do all they can to advance them, by encouraging of their trade; and no one way can do it more effectually, than to suppress those that do take their Trades from them.</P>
<P>I might add here also, that many of the houses in Cities and Market Towns do belong to many Gentry, and therefore they should be concerned for the encouragement of Trade therein, be&rehy;cause thereby they will advance their own revenue. But this par&rehy;ticular I have mentioned already under another head.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But these and Pedlers are a very great conveniency to the Countrey people, who have the opportunity of buying their com&rehy;modities at home.</P>
<P><IT>Ans.</IT> 1. If any person is so in love with this conveniency that he is unwilling to part with it, then it is pity that the said person had any other way but this for the vending both of his own, and Tennants Country Commodities.</P>
<P>2. There are very few of the Gentry in this Kingdom, but who have Horses and Servants, and so can send to a Market Town at any time, for any thing that they shall want; and for others there are few in <IT>England</IT> (especially within 80 or 100 Miles of <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT>) but they may either go or send thither two or three times in a Week. Formerly people had not this conveniency, and yet then they did well enough; for if they do not depend upon the having of any small thing at home, they will be sure to re&rehy;member, to have all that they want, when they either go or send to a Town.</P>
<P>However, if there be any such place, that is so remote from a Town, that they cannot send to it, without too much trouble, <PB
N="47">there a Shop-keeper may be allowed to set up, alwaies provided that he hath a certificate of his freedom of some Shop keeping Trade; and that the place where he shall set up in, be eight measured Miles from any Market Town, which is hardly six by computation.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> 2. But these and Pedlers do occasion more Wares to be sold, than otherwise there would be.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> If these and Pedlers be suppressed, then the people in the Countrey will frequent the Towns more, which will encourage the Shop-keepers to be better furnished than now they dare to be; and doubtless they will be as ingenious and as dexterous (though perhaps not so impudent) as the Pedlers to put off their Com&rehy;modities; and people when they are in Town, will be apt to buy more than now they do, that they may not want when they have occasion; and so by this means abundance of Wares may be u&rehy;sed more, because having thereof by them, they will be apt to spend the more; so that there will be little in this; besides, admit that these and Pedlers do promote the sale of some small trifles, yet they hinder the sale of those Commodities, that do more con&rehy;cern the publick good and interest; for if they be supprest, then people would frequent the Towns more, which will occasion more of Beer, and Ale, and Wine to be spent than now there is, which will advance both the King's Customs, and his Excise.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> 3. However some may say, it may be necessary for people in the Countrey to sell some small things, as pins, and the like.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> That under this pretence many will sell all other things, as hath been already shewed; and if men were of such publick spi&rehy;rits to endeavour to promote the trade of Cities and Market&rehy;Towns indeed, then it would be necessary that there were no trades permitted out of them, but such only that the Countrey cannot be without; such as a Black-smith, a Plow-wright, an ordinary Car&rehy;penter, and Mason, a Cobler, and a botching Taylor, fit only to mend and make the childrens clothes. Neither would it be ne&rehy;cessary that any Ale-houses in the Countrey be allowed to sell any <PB
N="48">Wine, or that they have any Bowling-green, or any thing else that might hinder the Gentry from coming to Market-Towns.</P>
<P>And as Shop-keepers in Villages, are a very great injury to Mar&rehy;ket-Towns, in the Countrey, even so are they to the City of <IT>Lon&rehy;don</IT>, that have (since the fire) set up in <IT>Convent-Garden</IT>, and on that side of the City; by which means many of the houses and Shops, are not tennanted, and those which are, the Rents of them are exceedingly fallen; and all this is for want of the Trade that they had formerly.</P>
<P>Now considering what a renowned City that is, both for go&rehy;vernment, for Trade, and for stately Edifices, that its thought, there is not the like in the whole World; and considering the geat charge that they have been at in the rebuilding of it, it is very re&rehy;quisite that they should be encouraged as much as may be, and that their Trade should not be taken away by such ways and means as these are. Now there are some Trades whose Commodities are such, that it would be very little more trouble for any one to go into the City to buy them, than to go to <IT>Convent-Garden</IT>, such as Wollen, or Linnen Cloth, Stuffs, or Hangings for Rooms, or Plate, or the like; if then all such Trades, were prohibited from setting up on that side of the City, it would presently fill their Shops and Houses with people, and their City with trade, I had thought to have treated here, how the Shopkeepers are inconvenienced to get in their small debts, which cannot be done any way without putting the people concerned to three times more charges than the debt is, which is likewise a great hinderance to the poor, as well as unto them; but this I shall omit, this book being already swollen much bigger than I did at first intend.</P></DIV>
<PB N="49"><DIV N="XVIII" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XVIII. <LB><IT>Some things suggested that might be for the improvement of Trade</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic;T is the custom of all Countreys to endeavour the improving of that which seemeth most nearly and chiefly to concern them; and other things that are more remote, not to be solicitous for; and therefore the <IT>Dutch</IT> do endeavour the promotion of Trade, for that is their nearest and chiefest concern; and we do chiefly en&rehy;deavour the improvement of rents and revenues, because this we apprehend is our nearest and chiefest concern. Trade seemeth to us to be more remote, although, as I humbly conceive, if it be rightly considered, that the way to improve rents and revenues, is first to improve trade; because the improvement hereof is the natural product of a good and flourishing trade. As for example if there happen to be a <CORR
SIC="fux">flux</CORR> of rain to fill all the little rivulets and dikes, they do naturally cause the greater river to rise by their flowing into it; and the greater confluence of waters there is in any of these rivulets, the higher will be the tide of the greater river. Now it is the same between trade and revenues; for if there be any flux of trade, that the trades-men thereby have a plenty, it presently advanceth all the Farmers commodities, and so consequently rents and revenues too; which are not only lands in the Countrey, but houses and shops in Cities and Market-Towns; and the freer current there is of trading, the higher will be the tide of rents and revenues. And so on the contrary, if the Far&rehy;mer be obstructed, the latter will be impeded and hindred. So that all persons are concerned to endeavour the promotion of trade. And for a farther incitement herunto, consider that the <IT>Dutch</IT> already have gotten into a trade with all the world, and the <IT>French</IT> King doth lay about him amain for his people to get into a trade too; and therefore it doth highly concern us to do the <PB
N="50">same; especially seeing that (as all Writers upon this subject do say) <IT>England</IT> hath as many conveniencies for trade as most places in the World, and the people are as industrious, only there wants laws to set their trade right, and afterwards to keep it in a right and good order: for if a watch be never so exquisitely and elabo&rehy;rately framed, yet if there be not a hand to set it right, and af&rehy;terwards to keep it so, it will quickly prove faulty, even as it is with trade at this time.
</P><P>Now to the end that trade might be promoted in this Kingdom, and that it may be regulated and set in such order, that it might run in its right current, and that we might be able to balance either the <IT>Dutch</IT> or <IT>French</IT> herein; I shall humbly suggest these three necessary particulars, that in all probability will effect the same.</P>
<P>1. If there were a counsel for trade made up of some eminent trades men of the City of <IT>London</IT>, mixt with some of the Coun&rehy;trey, and some eminent Clothiers, who might consider what might be necessary for the promotion of trade, and for the right setling thereof, and who might suggest the same to the Parliament when they do meet, that so they may have the less to do herein; for the whole structure of trade is very much out of frame at pre&rehy;sent, which would require much time to set it right again; and the Parliament do seldom sit above two or three months or there&rehy;abouts at a time, and then they have such a throng of other busi&rehy;ness obtruding them, that they have little or no leisure to mind the concerns of trade.</P>
&horbar;</DIV>
<PB N="51"><DIV N="XIX" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XIX. <LB><IT>Concerning all Trades being in Companies</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Iic;F all those of a Trade were of one and the same Company, and had power to make some by-laws for the good of their Trade, it would extremely conduce not only to the promotion of the same, but to the keeping of it in a right and good order, pre&rehy;serving (at least) a <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">temperamentum ad justitiam</FOREIGN></IT>, if not <IT><FOREIGN
LANG="LAT">ad pondus</FOREIGN></IT> in our trades and negotiations.
</P><P>And doubtless <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">ab origine</FOREIGN> it was so in <IT>London</IT>, as appears by the several denominations of their several Companies; the defect whereof, I judge, is the reason that the trade of that City is de&rehy;clining, and grown so consumptive, and (unless suitable and timely means be used in order to its recovery) will certainly and sudden&rehy;ly expire: For if none were of a Company but those only that were of the same trade, they would be freqently whetting one another to do something that might be for the advancement there&rehy;of; and every one would refrain the doing of any thing that might give a wound to the same, for fear of being reprehended by the Company.</P>
<P>But now if any persons trade do differ from the trade of his Company, of which he is free, he doth then mind but little the trade of that Company, because he hath a small benefit by it; but if his trade be the same with the Company of which he is free, then he is very often mindful of what may be necessary to pro&rehy;mote the same, because he doth expect a benefit by it.</P>
<P>Now (I conceive) this might easily be reduced to what it was at first; for it would be no prejudice to any of the Companies, for every one to have the liberty to come into that Company that his trade is of, and to be in the same state and degree therein, as he was in, in that Company that he came out of, without paying any thing more for it; because, as they shall hereby lose some of their <PB
N="52">members out of every Company, so will there be received some more into them.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> Now there are two Companies in <IT>London, viz.</IT> the Gird&rehy;lers and Fletchers, that the trades thereof are quite lost and gone, there being none of either of them; and if this device should take place, the rents belonging to those two Halls will be lost, be&rehy;cause there will be no body to look after them.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> That the Linnen-Drapers have no Hall, and is no Com&rehy;pany, which now is the most flourishing trade of the City; there&rehy;fore it would be very convenient to joyn these two Halls together, and to make them belong to the Linnen-Drapers Company.</P>
<P>And then to the end that this order might continue, it would be necessary that no person be suffered to set up the Trade of any particular Company, unless he be first made free of the same.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But if this be so, then the priviledg of the City will be lost; which is, that he that is free of any trade, may set up any other whatsoever, that he can best live upon.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> My meaning is, that he that hath been Apprentice to a working Trade, should not have the priviledg of setting up the Shopkeeping Trade, and that for the reasons that have been already given: Yet I deny not but that it might be convenient enough for any Shopkeeper (that is only of buying and selling) to have that priviledg to leave his own Trade, and to take up another Shop&rehy;keeping Trade, that he may live better upon. But then it would be necessary that he should be enjoyned to leave his own Trade altogether, and to quit his freedom of his Company, and that within a certain time, that may be thought convenient; and that he be also further enjoyned to take his Freedom of that Company as the Trade is of that he intends to set up, and that within such a convenient time.</P>
<P>And as this being in Companies, is necessary for Shopkeepers, and all other Trades, even so it is for Merchants too, that all they that do trafique to any particular Country, which should exceeding&rehy;ly encourage all Forreign trade; for there would be then such an <PB
N="53">order in the Trade of every particular Countrey, that men would gain thereby, whereas now it doth too often happen, that they do loose.</P>
<P>I know there are very wise men, that are very much against Mer&rehy;chants being in Companies, but I cannot find that any Merchan&rehy;dizing Trade is managed so well, as those that are managed by Companies; and this appeareth by the <IT>Dutch</IT>, who do trade al&rehy;together in Companies, and who is it that hath such success in Trade as they have; likewise our<IT>Hamborough</IT> trade was never carried on better, than when they were in a Company, and it was then better for Clothiers too, then ever it hath been since: and I cannot but believe that if the Fishing trade, that is so advanta&rehy;geous to the <IT>Dutch</IT>, were committed to a Company, it would in a short time turn to a very good account.</P>
<P>But I suppose that the reason that many are against merchants being in Companies, is because hereby many men would be bar&rehy;red from adventring to any Countrey, unless they were free of that same particular Company. Now to help this, it would be necessary that any one should have the liberty to be of any Company of Merchants that he hath a mind unto, always pro&rehy;vided that every such person do engage to submit to the Laws and Orders of the said Company; and if it be so, it can be no prejudice to any man, for he that hath an estate enough, may be free of many Companies, and so may adventure into many Countreys.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But now every particular trade, cannot be a particular Company in few other places but in <IT>London</IT>, by reason of the paucity of the Traders there.</P>
<P>But yet nevertheless, they may be in Companies in the Coun&rehy;trey Towns, for there may be many Trades that may conveni&rehy;ently be of one Company; as all these Shopkeeping trades, <IT>viz.</IT> The Woollen and Linnen Draper, the Mercer, the Milliner, the Apothecary, the Grocer, the Chandler, the Ironmonger, and the Book-seller; even so many Shop-keeping working Trades may be <PB
N="54">of another Company, and many other working Trades, that are not Shopkeeping Trades may be of another, and those that em&rehy;ploy the poor, may be a distinct company likewise.</P>
<P>Now it would be necessary also, that these Companies in Mar&rehy;ket Towns, should have the same priviledges, as they have in the City of <IT>London</IT>; that is to say, that they might choose their own officers, and have power to make by-Laws, for the benefit of their trades, and bind Apprentices, and make them free, and to give them a Certificate of their freedome, without which no per&rehy;son should set up any Shop keeping Trade in any place whatso&rehy;ever. Neither would it be fit for any one to manage two Shop&rehy;keeping trades, that is to say, such that either have been distinct trades of themselves, by the custom of the place, or that may be made so by agreement of the Shopkeepers of any place; for as I have said, it would be much for the benefit of the Shopkeep&rehy;ing Trades, that they are distinguished as much as may be. Nei&rehy;ther should any person be admitted to manage any other Trade but his own, unless he doth leave the same altogether within some convenient time after he hath set up another; and in default here&rehy;of he should be liable to a penalty. And then it would be expe&rehy;dient, that that irrational custom of Corporations be taken away, <IT>viz.</IT> That no one should set up a Trade in any place, but there only where the party was Apprentice. I can see no reason for this custom in any place but <IT>London</IT> only; for why should any man that hath served his time to a trade, be barred from setting up in ano&rehy;ther place, if he can have a better livlihood there, than he can where he served his time or; if a young man shall be offered a Shop, and a Wife in another place; why should he be barred of such an opportunity, that is so much for his preferment.</P>
<P>Therefore it would be necessary, that he that hath served an Apprentiship in any one place, might have the liberty to set up in any other whatsoever; always provided that he hath a Certifi&rehy;cate of his freedome, and that he is not likely to be chargeable to the Parish.</P></DIV>
<PB N="55"><DIV N="XX" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XX. <LB><IT>Concerning the great conveniences that Markets would be to the Woollen Manufacturer and others</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>3. &Iic;f there were weekly Markets appointed in convenient places of this Kingdom, for all the manifactures thereof to be sold, it would extremely help our trade, and be a very great benefit both to the Sellers, and also to the buyers.</P>
<P>For by this means, the Sellers, so soon as they have made their manufactures, would have presently a Market to go to, where they may meet with variety of Chapmen; and if the Market do not serve one day, it will be no great charge for them to go home, and to come another; when it may be their wares might go off bet&rehy;ter, and then all the rest of their time, they are at home looking after their affairs; whereas now, they are forced to spend a con&rehy;siderable part of their time, in running up and down the Countrey to sell them Wares, whilst their business doth go backwards at home.</P>
<P>And as it will be convenient to the Sellers, even so it will be to the Buyers too, who by this means will have the opportunity of the choise of goods, and of furnishing themselves with all the as&rehy;sertments of such commodities as are sold at that Market, which they could never be supplied with by the Hawkers.</P>
<P>Now one great reason, why so many manufacturers do run all about the Countrey, hawking of their Commodities, is because they have had hardly any other conveniency but this to sell them; except it be at Fairs, which (as it may be supposed) are not so con&rehy;venient as Markets; and that for these following reasons.</P>

N="56">ther, that it will not be very soon, that they shall have the oppor&rehy;tunity of another, and that it will be a charge to carry their Wares home, and bring them again the next ensuing Fair; they are there&rehy;fore very solicitous and earnest to put off their Commodities by trucking them for things that they know not what to do with; and this is the reason likewise, that the Clothiers do so much run into the Shop-keeping trade as now they do, and is the cause of ruining both the Trade of the Countrey, and more especially of the City of <IT>London</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> Because there being so far a distance of time between the Fairs, that the poor Manufacturer his Stock will not keep on his Trade so long, which doth put him upon the borrowing of Money, which he promising to pay again at the Fair, is many times forced to sell his Commodities for ready Money to a very great loss.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>Now a Market every week will remedy this, because when this poor man hath made as far as his Stock will go, there is a Market ready for him presently to go to, so that by this means, he may sel&rehy;dom have occasion to borrow Money to drive on his Trade.</P>
<P>Now concerning the places, that might be most convenient for these Markets, it would be necessary, that wheresoever any Com&rehy;modity is made, that there should be a Market for the same, <IT>viz.</IT> at <IT>Meer</IT> for Ticks, at <IT>Sherborne</IT> for Buttons, at <IT>Taunton</IT> and <IT>Exe&rehy;ter</IT> for Serges, and <IT>Manchester</IT> for Dimithys and Fustions, and o&rehy;ther Commodities made there; at <IT>Norwich</IT> for their Stuffs, and likewise at all Sea-ports, where any of our Manufacture is shipt off; as at <IT>Bristol, Southampton, Hull</IT>, and <IT>Newcastle</IT>, and the like; <IT>London</IT> will be a Market sufficient for all places within three&rehy;score Miles of it.</P>
<P>And then when once these Markets are setled in the several and respective places, it would be necessary that no person or persons whatsoever, have any liberty, either to buy or sell any such Com&rehy;modities, that are usually bought and sold by Shop-keepers, but either at the Market-place appointed in the several Cities and Towns, or at his or their own dwelling house, & he that should either <PB
N="57">buy or sell any such commodities that should be proffered, (unless it be in one of the aforesaid places,) they should be liable to a pe&rehy;nalty.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But should the Silk-weavers, and all others, be enjoyned to sell their wares at a market, it may be prejudicial to the whole-sale&rehy;trade in <IT>London</IT>; because many Countrey Chapmen may buy at these Markets.</P>
<P><IT>Sol.</IT> That they have already in <IT>London</IT> a by-law, that all wares are forfeited that are forreign bought, and forreign sold, and none but Free-men are allowed to buy at <IT>Blackwell-Hall</IT>; and so it may be at these Markets: And for the benefit of the City, it may be more strict, <IT>viz.</IT> That it should be unlawful for any Free-man to allow any other to buy at these Markets in his name.</P>

<DIV N="XXI" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XXI. <LB><IT>Concerning the making of Linnen-Cloth</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Nic;Ow all men do look upon this to be one of the best designs that ever was in <IT>England</IT>, because hereby our Poor will be employed, our Land will be improved, and many thousands of pounds will be saved from going out of the Kingdom for this commodity.
</P><P>Concerning the place that would be most convenient for the setling of this Trade; it should not be any where within sixty miles of <IT>London</IT>, especially all along by the river of <IT>Thames</IT>; for all the land in this distance doth bring forth little enough to sup&rehy;ply that City with Corn and other Provision: And besides, all these places would be most convenient for the clothing-trade, as appears by those reasons before given; neither would any of the West Countrey be convenient for it, because there they have a manu&rehy;facture that is sufficient to employ them already.</P>
<P>Therefore, as I conceive, that the only place for this Trade <PB N="58">would be in the Northern parts of <IT>England</IT>, especially if the <IT>Irish</IT> Act be repealed; and that for these reasons.</P>
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL>1.</LABEL> Because those lands that are now used for the breeding of cattel, may then be used for the sowing of Hemp and Flax, which doubtless in a very short time will be as great an improvement unto them as the breeding of cattel can be.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> Because there the Poor do work at very low rates, which will make the Linnen to be the cheaper, and therefore the more likely for the trade to take effect.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>3.</LABEL> Because hereby our Shipping will be employed in the same manner as it is now, from <IT>Morloix</IT> and St. <IT>Malo</IT>; for <IT>Hull</IT> and <IT>Newcastle</IT> will be both convenient Markets for the commodity, and convenient Ports too, from whence it may be shipt off for <IT>London</IT>, and other places.</ITEM></LIST>
<LIST><ITEM>Now for the effecting of this trade in <IT>England</IT>, it would be ne&rehy;cessary that the Farmer who doth sow the Hemp and Flax, should hackle it, and get all the stubs out of it before he offereth it to sale.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> When he hath so done, that then he bring it to a Market to sell as Wooll, or as any other thing is sold.</ITEM>
<ITEM><P><LABEL>3.</LABEL> That there be Linsters or Linneners in the Cities and Mar&rehy;ket-Towns in those parts, that should be encouraged, who might buy this Hemp and Flax of the Farmer, and cause it afterwards to be drest, and spun, and woven, and whiten'd, and made fit for the Market. And it would be necessary that the thread be whitened before it is made into Cloth, which will hereby the more resemble <IT>French</IT> Lockeram and Dowlas, and will be much the stronger Cloth.
</P><P>And the way to encourage the people to adventure upon this trade, would be to secure them from being losers by it; for those that are most likely to do good upon this trade, must be such that are stirring men, and that have some small stock of their own; which being all that they have to depend upon, are unwilling to hazard it in a publick concern; and there is no reason that they <PB
N="59">should, especially because its seldom but that he is a great loser who doth first adventure upon any new project. Now this is the way that the <IT>Dutch</IT> do take in any such design, and it must be the way that we must take to, if ever we intend to effect any thing of this nature in <IT>England</IT>, as is plain in that there have been but lit&rehy;tle or no progress made herein, though it be near fifteen years ago since the Parliament made a law to encourage it.
</P><P><IT>Obj.</IT> But if those that do undertake this business be secured from losing, then the Countrey may be cheated; for they may pre&rehy;tend to be losers when they are not.
</P><P><IT>Sol.</IT> It must be expected that in the obtaining of such a trade as this is, there must be some inconveniences dispensed with at first, which will be better born by a publick than by a private stock; and then this inconveniency may not be for any long continuance, but only unto such time that the people have learned the way, and are a little acquainted with the same. I shall not suggest any thing how this stock may be raised for the securing of those per&rehy;sons, because that may be easily done in the several and particular Counties where this manufacture shall be made.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>4.</LABEL> That it would be necessary that there be a Dame in every Parish (as was before suggested) to teach the Poor to spin this Lin&rehy;nen.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>5.</LABEL> That when once this Linnen-trade hath took effect, it would be necessary that we do lay as high an Impost upon all <IT>French</IT> Lin&rehy;nens, as they have laid upon all our Woollen manufacture.</ITEM></LIST>

<PB N="60"><DIV N="XXII" TYPE="part"><HEAD>SECT. XXII. <LB><IT>What Statutes in force may be injurious to Trade, and Trades men</IT>.</HEAD>
<P>&Tic;Here are several Statutes in force that are injurious to trade, but especially that for the subsidy of Aulneage, as will ap&rehy;pear, if any one do consider,
</P><P>1. The exceeding greatness of the forfeiture, which for not paying of two pence for a Seal, there may be lost a piece of Cloth worth fifteen Pounds.</P>
<P>2. That notwithstanding the greatness of this forfeiture, yet Trades men are continually obnoxious hereunto; it being not possi&rehy;ble to avoid it; for sometimes the Seal will rub off in carriage, which being found, hath cost some men dear; sometimes they rub off in shewing, and tumbling of the Wares in the Shops upon Market days; or when men are busy, they cut off the part that the Seal is annexed to, and do not mind it; and sometimes Ser&rehy;vants are careless herein; but in all these cases these Cloths, or these remnants of Cloth are liable to be lost; nay a Shop-keeper is hereby hindred from selling half a Cloth at any time to a Chap&rehy;man; because they cannot both have one Seal on their parts, and he that hath it not is likewise liable to loose his; so that by reason of this law, the Shopkeeper is in danger of losing.</P>
<P>By this means the duty is doubly paid, and more; for although there is not one Cloth or Serge that cometh into any mans Shop, without this duty being first paid, yet the Shopkeeper is forced to pay what the Aulneager will have every year; which commonly is more than the whole duty would come to, if he paid for every particular piece that he receiveth into his Shop; and if he desired more, the Shopkeeper must pay it; unless he will always be in fear of being prejudic'd. Certainly if Markets were established as is before suggested, they would remedy this, because then those <PB
N="61">concerned in the gathering of this Tax, may look only after the Cloth and Serge in the Markets, and so might not be permitted to examine any Mans shop, or at least, if they were, only whole pieces should be liable hereunto, and not any remnants; for no man for the saving of two pence, would cut his Cloth into rem&rehy;nants, and then it would be necessary, that the forfeiture doth not exceed five Shillings, which is enough for not paying of so small a sum; nay, and if the seal have been rubb'd off in the car&rehy;riage, and that the Shopkeeper can procure a Certificate under the hand and seal of a Justice of Peace, that the party of whom the Cloth was bought, hath testifyed upon his oath, that the said Cloth was sealed, and that the duty thereof was paid; that in this case the forfeiture should be omitted.</P>
<P>2. The Person before mentioned <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Mr. Cooke.</NOTE> doth say, that the Statute a&rehy;gainst Naturalization, is prejudicial to trade, because there is a great want of People in <IT>England</IT>; there being so great a multitude, that have transplanted themselves into other Countries, and many lost by the late Wars, and by the great Massacre in <IT>Ireland</IT>, and the late great Plague; all which have very much depopulated <IT>England</IT>; especially all places that are upwards of fifty or sixty Miles off <IT>London</IT>; and then there is abundance of wast Land in <IT>Eng&rehy;land</IT>, such are Commons, which would imploy multitudes of people more than we have, though the law forbid other Na&rehy;tions: other Countries have thought this to be their interest, in&rehy;somuch that they have not only invited the people of <IT>England</IT>, such that have had skill to work upon that Manufacture, that they have had a design to promote; but they have also encouraged them by appointing them a convenient place to live in, and exempted them for some years from paying those Taxes usually paid by the Natives; and if this be for the benefit of this Nation, (as is deemed, not only be the person before mentioned, but by many other judicious and Wise men,) then never was <CORR
SIC="their">there</CORR> a better op&rehy;pertunity for it than now, when so many parts are so sorely in&rehy;fested with Wars, that people would (in all likelihood) be easily <PB
N="63[62]">induced hereunto: indeed these <IT>Walloons</IT> that setled in <IT>England</IT>, in the raign of <IT>Qu. Elizabeth</IT>, were never hurtful but helpful to this Nation, and the Art of making their Manufacture is now as beneficial to this Kingdom, as any other whatsoever; and doubtless so would it be, if a Colony of people that had skill to make Linnen-cloth, were setled in the Northern part of this Nation.</P>
<P>The <IT>Irish</IT> act that prohibits the importation of their lean Cat&rehy;tel, doth greatly hinder Trade, in that the Money that was made of them was returned in Commodities; such as all sorts of Silks both wrought and unwrought; all sorts of Stuffs, both Hair and Worsted; Cloth Gold, and Silver, and Silk Laces, and many other Commodities, and then by this means there was meat in our Sea-ports for the victualling of Ships, which brought a Trade unto them from other parts; not only for Victuals, but for Tallow and Hides also; all which Trade by this Act is quite lost and gone.</P>
<P>2. It is injurious to the Grasiers too, in regard that these Cat&rehy;tel did cost less Money, and would fat sooner, and so did pay far better than would our <IT>English</IT> breed Cattel; and by reason that so much meat was vended into other Countries, from our Sea-ports, they always had a quick sale for their fat Cattel, which is not so now.</P>
<P>3. All men, both Gentlemen Trades men, and Countrey men, are injured by it, in that they pay at least a fifth penny more for their meat now, than they did before this Act was made, which if it were accounted from the time that this Act was made, it would amount to many hundred thousands of Pounds in the whole King&rehy;dom: seeing then it is so much against the general good, it would be happy for this Kingdom if it was repealed; for there is but one little spot of the Land in comparison of the whole that receiveth any benefit by it, which is only in the Northern parts for breeding of young Cattel upon their Land, which (as I have said) would be as well improved by sowing of Hemp and Flax if in those Parts the making of Linnen Cloth was encouraged.</P>
