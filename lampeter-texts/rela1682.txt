I owe much excuse to the world but cannot reasonably owe any to you, because your Judgment upon it ju&rehy;stified the Discourse; and your Autho&rehy;rity enjoyn'd me to deliver up the Copy.

<P>&Aic;Mongst all those various broods of Sects that ignorance and wilfulness have spawned in the World, there is none but is covetous that Antiquity should Patronize it; never decrying its venerable Testimony, nor fearing its ora&rehy;culous Answers, but when they distrust its votes opposite to their present espousals; Gray hairs being as well the Glory of an Opinion, as the Crown of the Old man. Hence is it that both Nations and Families have had such severe Contests with each other, concerning the time of their first rise, that from thence their Pedegree may appear Ancient, and they might gain re&rehy;nown from the date of their Original. <PB
N="2">And as in Persons and Opinions, so in things too, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">quo antiquius e&ograve; melius</FOREIGN>, by how much the more Ancient a thing is, by so much the more is it prized and va&rehy;lued by those that covet a strict inspection into the Periods that did preceed their own, who measure the proportions of an infant World, and thus antedate their own Beings: How precious is a Script of <IT>Tris&rehy;megistus</IT>? Or the least Workmanship of an inspired <IT>Bezaleel</IT>? The smallest Leaf of <IT>Solomon's</IT> Herbal would be deemed a Pre&rehy;sent Noble enough for the greatest Mo&rehy;narch; How do we prize an old piece of <IT>Roman</IT> Coin? Or an antiquated <IT>Grecian</IT> Monument? Nor is this a Truth recei&rehy;ving a general impress and confirmation, in respect of Artificial and Philosophical Objects; but even Divinity too, having for its Author the Ancient of Days, values that which carries Age furrowed in its Face, and has Gravity and Years visible on its Brow: And nothing seems more to as&rehy;perse and disparage whatever wears the Title of Religion than to accuse it of No&rehy;vity, and to bear the date of a late Inven<PB
N="3">tion: Hence <IT>Haman</IT> endeavoured from this Topick to brand the <IT>Jews</IT>, in that they used other Customs different from the an&rehy;cient Laws of the <IT>Persians</IT>, that their No&rehy;velty might render them odious to the King, being a crime it seems sufficient to ruin them, when <IT>Mordecai</IT> could not bow to so insulting a Favorite: <NOTE

N="4">our own Confines we shall find the two great struglers for the Western Empire of Conscience and Religion, still endeavour to Crown their Opinions with old Age, and to gain both Strength and Honour to their Establishment from time and dura&rehy;tion. The <IT>Romans</IT> would have the World to understand that the Pillars of their Church were founded with Christianity, and that our Saviour himself once held those Keys which he afterwards delivered to the Papal Succession. But though they had a firm Foundation, they have built upon it a tottering Superstructure. The Pro&rehy;testant would willingly obliterate the odi&rehy;um of a late Reformation, and will an&rehy;tedate <IT>Luther</IT> and the <IT>German</IT> heats, search&rehy;ing in the midst of a bloody Inquisiti&rehy;on; some being willing to Travel to <IT>Bohemia</IT> to derive their Principles from <IT>John Hus</IT>, and <IT>Jerom</IT> of <IT>Prague</IT>, not on&rehy;ly sending us to our own <IT>Wiccliffe</IT>, but eating through the Mountains to find out the more Ancient (though obscure) <IT>Wal&rehy;denses</IT>: others (and that more justly too) as if all this will not yet evince their Prin<PB
N="5">ciples Aged, will Travel farther to the Churches Cradle, and find out the Man&rehy;ger in which our Saviour himself was laid, and from his Mouth receive their Do&rehy;ctrine, reviving what might seem dead, having for some time been buryed in the dust and rubbish of mens Inventions; and freeing it from those Burdens and Cor&rehy;ruptions which a gainful Interest, and bold Presumption had loaded it withal, thus cause that to abide in them which Christians heard from the beginning.
</P><P>Antiquity then being so powerful a mo&rehy;tive to persuade to Religion, that all strive to catch and grasp it; I shall easily prevail for a diligent attention since what I deliver shall be that which has been heard from the beginning.</P>
<P>In which Text we have an Exhortation both Grave and Seasonable; Grave it is, avoiding those levities and varnish which Novices use to wrap their late and uncouth Opinions in, that they may be snatched at with the more greedy Appetite: As Phy&rehy;sicians put their bitter Pills in sweet Con&rehy;serves that the Patient may swallow them <PB
N="6">with the greater delight: and seasonable was this advice too; since <IT>Simon</IT>, and the <IT>Gnosticks</IT>, did now attempt the murdering Christianity when it was just born; as <IT>He&rehy;rods</IT> cruelty, drinking in, with an insatia&rehy;ble thirst, the blood of Infants, would have Crucified our Saviour in his Cradle, before Age had given him Strength and Stature, not only to publish his Fathers Message, but even to bear his own Cross. Nay least this accursed, and Antichristian Sect, provoking their desires to unlawful Lusts, detracting from Christianity by an impious and incoherent intermixture of Jewish and Heathen Rites and Practices, with what was now Solemn in its pro&rehy;posal, and Sacred by its establishment, should not be able to impede, or retard, the most glorious flourish of Gospel Truth, and forbid the spreading of the Christian Church, that Noble Vine but newly Planted; <IT>Cerinthus</IT> also now ad&rehy;vanced, with all the wild Boars of the Forrest, if possibly, to undermine and root her up, denying the Divinity of its first Author: An Heretick so foul and pol<PB
N="7">luted, that the blessed Pen-man of my present Text would not come into the same Bath in which the wicked <IT>Cerinthus</IT> washed, least he should be defiled with that water which had touched so filthy and loathsome a Carcass; and the Bath it self, sensible of its own pollution, should im&rehy;mediately fall to make a Grave for its self and possessours.</P>
<P>In the Exhortation then there are three Parts presented to our view <LIST
REND="runon"><ITEM><LABEL>(1.)</LABEL> A Duty, <IT>Let that therefore abide in you</IT>,</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL>(2.)</LABEL> Its Ob&rehy;ject, <IT>Which ye have heard</IT>;</ITEM><ITEM><LABEL>(Lastly)</LABEL> The Motive and Inducement to the Duty, Be&rehy;cause it was <IT>from the beginning</IT>.</ITEM></LIST></P>
<P>I must crave leave to invert the Parts, though it shall make no alteration in the Sence; that first the Object being explain&rehy;ed, and the Motive proposed, the Duty may be with the greater facility pressed and embraced. (1.) Then, Let the Object in the Text exhibite it self; and this is no&rehy;thing but what ye have already heard. As Faith it self is generated by the Ear, so what you have heard is nothing else but the Object of your Faith; for thus does the <PB
N="8">Apostle conclude the inference; <Q REND="it">Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God</Q>, (Rom. 10.17.) But as Hearing is the Conduit to convey Faith, so some&rehy;times is it the decoy to infidelity; because there are many false Prophets gone forth into the World; and a seeming truth may make the same impression with truth it self. Nay, our blessed Saviour, that he might not leave us without due Caution, has informed all Ages and Generations, that there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets; yea! and shall superadd Won&rehy;ders to their Oratory, not only to amuse the World, but to gain credit and repu&rehy;tation to their Doctrine; insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall prevail to the dismal shaking of the strongest Oakes, and the rooting up the tallest Cedars of <IT>Libanus</IT>; even to the putting a falacy upon the very Elect, (<IT>Matth.</IT> 24.24.) The Ear of Man, being the recepticle of all Sounds, no wonder that it admits the founding Brass and tinckling Cymbal, as well as the Trumpets of the Sanctuary. <IT>Simon Magus</IT> may be <CORR
SIC="as as">as</CORR> welcome to the <IT>Sama<PB N="9">ritans</IT>, as <IT>Paul</IT> and <IT>Barnabas</IT> to the Disci&rehy;ples at <IT>Antioch</IT>. If a vain-glorious <IT>Herod</IT> has but Confidence enough to make an O&rehy;ration, though repugnant to the first Prin&rehy;ciples of Religion, nor wonder that it makes such an impress upon the Multi&rehy;tude, that they give shouts, with the lou&rehy;dest Acclamations, and attribute to him the Wisdom of a Deity, who is scarce en&rehy;dowed with the Prudence of a Man; (<IT>Acts</IT> 12.22.) If a mechanick Silversmith, prompted with no other motive than what Avarice and Interest can dictate, shall con&rehy;fidently plead for the Shrines of <IT>Diana</IT>; the clamorous Multitude shall soon cry out, <Q
REND="it">Great is Diana of the Ephesians</Q>, (<IT>Act.</IT> 19.28.) So easily captivated are vulgar Affections, and of so slender a value is po&rehy;pular Applause. The mutable Croud will change their Religion with their Garments, and is of that still which is of the newest fashion. As if <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">novitas essendi</FOREIGN> were the Be&rehy;ing of Devotion, and Age were not the Measure of Divinity. As if the newest Stamp were to be deemed alwaies the tru&rehy;est Metal; and the last dictate of a falla<PB
N="10">cious Understanding were the best object for the Wills embracement: Then indeed our Saviours Argument would be nothing but a Sophism against Pharisaical Devor&rehy;ces; <Q
REND="it">From the beginning 'twas not so</Q>, (<IT>Matth.</IT> 19.8.) nor would the Advice in the Text be solid; <Q
REND="it">Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning.</Q></P>
<P>But it is not every thing that pleases the Ear that must be closeted and lodged in the Heart, lest Tares being sowed amongst the Corn, they spread, and flourish, and o'er-shadow the Grain: Our Saviour there&rehy;fore knowing our promptitude to imbibe what might seem pleasant, and to swallow Poyson if wrap'd up in gilded Pills; leaves a grave and severe Caveat, <Q
REND="it">Take heed what ye hear</Q>, (<IT>Mark.</IT> 4.24.) and lest our strict observation of the matter should make us regardless of the manner of performance; St. <IT>Luke</IT> delivers it, <Q
REND="it">Take heed how you hear</Q>; (<IT>Luke</IT> 8.18.) <NOTE
TYPE="marginalia" PLACE="margin" ANCHORED="NO">Eccles. 5.</NOTE> As well knowing that <CORR
SIC="too too">too</CORR> few look to their Feet when they ap&rehy;proach the Sanctuary of the Lord, but are more ready to offer the Sacrifice of Fools, then to hear their Vices redargued as they <PB

SIC="Too too">Too</CORR> many sooner bow their Ears to what may irritate and provoke their lust; to the frothy discourses of deceitful Tongues; to bold Rants, and jovial Catches; to those lewd Sonnets that are the loose com&rehy;posures of looser brains, which being heated with vice, boil over in scum and filth: men are more attentive to new Oaths, and unheard of Blasphemies; to such as jest, and droll down Religion, that it may no <PB
N="12">longer interrupt the pleasant wickedness of a degenerated Age; to such as are so hardy as to Lampoon Heaven, and make Satyrs against the Quire above; that would, if either method might prevail, Flout, or Hector, God Almighty from his Throne; whose Language is more exalted than rayling <IT>Rabshekeh's</IT>. These, that are spots in our Feasts of Charity, become the only Persons worthy of Entertain&rehy;ment; their black Language is viewed, and gazed on, as the brightest Oracles; every shrug raises admiration, and a little smile is enough to authorize a great jest: as if these wandering Comets were of more so&rehy;lidity than the fixed Stars; and the Lan&rehy;guage of Hell to be more diligently at&rehy;tended than the Voice of Heaven. God at once pardon and remedy it. The Am&rehy;bassadours of the Most High may take up the Lamentation of him that first gave them their Commission. <Q
REND="it">To whom shall we speak and give warning that they may hear? Behold their Ear is Uncir&rehy;cumcised, and they cannot hearken; Be&rehy;hold the word of the Lord is to them a <PB
N="13">reproach; they have no delight in it.</Q> (Jer. 6.10.)</P>
<P>Some indeed are much for the Ear; at&rehy;tending to those scandals and reproaches that the envious man will cast upon him whom his malice ruins, or his ambition undermines: others, even in Sacred things, reduce devotion all to the Ear; and when God, principally requires the Heart in Prayer, these will give little else but the Ear in Hearing; being as partial in their Sacrifices towards God, as they are in their Censures towards their Neighbours, as if the Decalogue were now abolished, and the only Command were, <IT>Hear O Israel</IT>. 'Twas the error of the <IT>Euchites</IT> to be al&rehy;ways Praying, and 'tis as great an error to be always Hearing: as if the School of our Saviour should not only be enjoyned Biennial silence, but be for ever mute. <IT>Porphyry</IT> indeed, (that great <CORR
SIC="Blaspemer">Blasphemer</CORR>, big with malice against the Heavens) when checks of Conscience forced him to speak out something of the results of his own Reason, teacheth us to Sacrifice our Souls to God in silence with Chast thoughts; <PB
N="14">How Chast men are at those seasons that ought to be attended with Solemnity, and Devotion, it would be presumption in any to judg: but sure I am that they put in practice this sage advice of their Fa&rehy;ther <IT>Porphyry</IT>, who thus pretend to Wor&rehy;ship God in silence: As if he that made the Tongue as well as the Ear, did not re&rehy;quire the one to make Oblations of Prayer and Praise, as well as the other to Hear his Word; or he that Created the whole man would be contented with a partial Sacrifice. And now if any one has Ears to hear let him hear; and not only so, but retain also what he has heard; so will the Exhortation in my Text be embraced: <Q
REND="it">Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to free man&rehy;kind from such diseases and distempers in Religion; I must now crave leave to at&rehy;tempt the recommendation of our duty; and persuade men to the diligent atten&rehy;tion to that Sacred Word, which is able to make us wise unto Salvation, and be greedy to receive it, when not extended <PB
N="15">in an adulterated hand: For as we cannot hear without a Preacher, so he cannot Preach that is not sent, (<IT>Rom.</IT> 10.15.) <NOTE

LANG="LAT" REND="it">Non permittitur mulieri in Eccle&rehy;si&acirc; loqui, sed nec docere, nec tinguere; nec offerre; nec ullius virilis muneris, nedum sacerdotalis officii, fortem tibi vindicare</Q>: or like those that St. <IT>Austin</IT> complains of, in the second Chapter of his first Book of the <IT>Trinity</IT>, that are <Q
LANG="LAT" REND="it">garruli ratiocinatores, e&rehy;latiores quam capaciores</Q>; that are pratling Disputants, more shrill than rational: How many dismal mourning souls, whose Education never advanced them to any degree above Mechanism, steal away the Priests Office, as <IT>Neanthus</IT> did <IT>Orpheus's</IT> Harps, who thinking to effect the same wonders <IT>Orpheus</IT> did, and make Woods <PB
N="16">and Trees dance after his melody, played so ill, that the very Dogs, being affrighted at his strange noise, tore him all in pieces. When we hear therefore, we must not throw away our attention upon usurping Schismaticks; whose very Preaching is their Crime, because without a Sacred and Divine Commission; and since giving them Audience is their encouragment, it can no less involve such easie Auditors in a snare and guilt.</P>
<P>And yet, since the Text exhibits some&rehy;thing that always has been heard, it does not only imply our duty of attention, but presents us with what we ought to hear; and thats the Gospel; what both the Apo&rehy;stles and Disciples were acquainted with from the beginning: And since, in that Sacred Testimony to our Saviour, there are various Truths which make up its Con&rehy;texture; those things are first to be heard and received that are in themselves most Fundamental; <Q
LANG="LAT" REND="it">Primarium dogma de Christi divinitate</Q>, (says <IT>Justinian</IT>) the chief Doctrine of the Divinity of our Saviour, without which the Foundation being sunk, the <PB
N="17">whole fabrick must of necessity be demo&rehy;lished: For since his Divinity gives merit to his Passion, by which his temporal pu&rehy;nishment bears proportion to an infinite offence; detract from his Deity and you spot his sufferings; and then if he be a Lamb with blemish, though he be slain, he cannot satisfie; and so the series of our Sal&rehy;vation becomes disordered, and our eternal safety undermined.</P>
<P>And now perhaps some wise person might take advantage to exhibite, or ad&rehy;venture at a Catalogue of Fundamentals; and a clamorous Adversary might with as much confidence and triumph demand them; but when we receive a particular of Explicits, we may then attempt a Ca&rehy;talogue of Fundamentals. In the mean time, since Faith is the general condition of the Gospel; and, <Q
REND="it">He that believeth, and and is baptised, shall be saved</Q> (Mark. 16.16.) Methinks we need disturb our selves no further for Fundamentals, than to de&rehy;fine what compleats that one thing, Faith. And though Interest and Opinion have rendered it as different from it self as one <PB
N="18">mans fancy from another, and we have created almost as many varieties of Faith, not only as there are Nations in the world, but men too; (multitudes dealing by it as <IT>Caligula</IT> did by the Image of <IT>Jupiter Olym&rehy;piacus</IT> when he took from it its head of Gold, and put upon it an head of Brass;) yet if we will admit the Father of the Faithful: to explain the difficulty, we shall find that the practice of the Patri&rehy;arch <IT>Abraham</IT>, (who is exhibited as a pat&rehy;tern for Gospel believers;) will give us a prospect of that Faith which had its being from the beginning. And though there are many acts of this ancient Faith pre&rehy;sented to our perusal in New Testament Pages, yet there are two comprehensive of all the rest, to wit Belief and Obedi&rehy;ence. For when he to whom all things are possible, had promised a branch should sprout forth from this dry Root; and that he would be his shield, and great reward (<IT>Gen.</IT> 15.1.) <IT>Abraham</IT> did not questi&rehy;on the word of a Deity, who, he knew, was able to controul the world, and alter the power of second Causes according to <PB
N="19">the pleasure of his own will: but stedfastly assented to the truth of what God had pro&rehy;mised; relying on it with Faith and Expe&rehy;ctation. And as this Action includes be&rehy;lief of the Promises, so the second pre&rehy;scribes obedience to the Commands; and it was that work which St. <IT>James</IT> says justi&rehy;fied him, even the offering up his Son <IT>Isaac</IT> upon the Altar (<IT>Jam.</IT> 2.21.) So that to sum up the whole Gospel in one word, that you may here have presented in an Epitome, what I humbly beg may abide in you: He that believes the Promises, so as to obey the Precepts; that accepts his Saviour as a King to rule, and a Prophet to teach, as well as a Priest to make at&rehy;tonement; and, consequently, submits to the authority of his Laws, and to the con&rehy;duct of his Ministry and Discipline; that relies upon the merits of his Cross, and persues the steps of his vertuous Life, in order to the securing his eternal Safety: He is the Person who retains what he has already heard; and he need not fear any deceiptfull Imposition, since he embraces that which was from the beginning. Which <PB
N="20">minds me of the Motive here proposed, to fortifie our resolutions, that what we have heard may abide in us, since it is no more than what was delivered from the begin&rehy;ning.</P>
<P>In Philosophical Propositions we usual&rehy;ly deem those most certain that later expe&rehy;riments prove, and evince: but, in Divine Truths, those are best that were from the beginning. Time, which is in a continu&rehy;ed flux, being in this like the swiftest Tor&rehy;rents, that carry down to us what is light and frothy; but sink that which is grave and ponderous: and indeed Reason, which is the result of our nobler part, if not disturbed by passion or interest, is the surest guide in the midst of perplexities; and this does, upon the first prospect of Religion, lead us to that which was from the beginning. And Christianity being that which pretends to be first begotten in Hea&rehy;ven, though brought forth here on Earth, owning not less than a God for its Author, whose great propositions are made up of Eternal Truths; and since the Apostles were inspired to a compleat delivery of <PB
N="21">what was at first Preached by our Savi&rehy;our, the same Doctrine, by a continued succession, having been derived and con&rehy;veyed to Posterity; it follows, by an ine&rehy;vitable conclusion, that the surest way, for us, to whom these Principles are exhibited, when any Objection, or different Opini&rehy;on, presents it self, to startle our appre&rehy;hensions; is to persue the first Rule, and follow that which was delivered from the beginning.</P>
<P>But since the various subdivisions of those that intitle themselves to the names of Christians, pretend to those infallible Maxims treasured up in the Sacred Book; there must be left a Judg of Controver&rehy;sies; or else there will remain no way of freedom from present disturbances, or certain method of reducing those who, being too fond of their own fancies, re&rehy;solutely adhere to their private Opinions, to the detriment of Christianity, and ruin of themselves, and the obstruction of Peace and Unity in the world. The Do&rehy;ctrine of the Gospel, although certain in it self, being conveyed to us in Words <PB
N="22">and Language which may admit of diffe&rehy;rent Constructions, suitable either to the use of words, or the apprehensions of men, cannot, (without such a judgment upon it as may oblige the various extravagancies of mankind to silence, and a passive sub&rehy;mission, whatever may be their internal belief;) be sufficient Clue to lead us out of these Labyrinths: Though had the multi&rehy;tude of its Followers justly measured and proportioned Understandings, rightly to discern the Fruits wrapped in those Leaves, it must appear to every man, the best, and only Conductor in the world. But, be&rehy;cause every person usurps Authority to interpret, and every Illiterate and Enthusi&rehy;astical head, if he has not reason to confirm his Gloss, has confidence however to pre&rehy;tend an Inspiration; necessity inforces us to seek some method to quiet our minds, and to allay the briskness of our own fan&rehy;cies, and those heats and fury, that our warmer contrivances introduce into the world: that so we may arrive at such cer&rehy;tainty as is possible to be obtained, of what was heard from the beginning.</P>
<PB N="23"><P>And though I shall not attempt the lead&rehy;ing any to St. <IT>Peters</IT> Chair, nor beg that <IT>Rome</IT> may be the place of Umpire; be&rehy;cause there is no need of fetching water from <IT>Tiber</IT> when we have clear Fountains at our own doors: yet reason must force this confession, that since it is not the let&rehy;ter, but the sence, of Scripture that is the proper Guide of life; there must be al&rehy;lowed some Interpretation, since our de&rehy;mands to one another may be the same with the Eunuch to St. <IT>Philip</IT>, how shall we Read without some Interpreter? And then the last question will be who are those that are most likely to exhibit to us the exact design of Scripture Phrase, and the infallible Rule that leads to Life?
</P><P>To produce therefore some conclusions touching this controverted, and difficult, Question; Those must certainly best inform one of the meaning of a Sermon, that have had the most familiar acquaintance with the Preacher; Capacities also to ap&rehy;prehend, and Fidelity to deliver what they have received from the mouth of the Ora&rehy;tor: upon which proposition those per<PB
N="24">sons, that seem most rational, attempt the proof of the Apostles Writings that are but the first Commentaries upon that Gospel which our Saviour Preached and Ushered into the World. From hence (secondly) it follows that the persons who were the immediate Disciples to those Holy Penmen of Sacred Writ, having the advantages of Converse, and the benefit of Audience, must of necessity be the fittest Judges of what is Controverted in matter of our Re&rehy;ligion, which we pretend to derive from their Books and Writings: and there seems to remain nothing to be doubted, but ei&rehy;ther their Capacities to receive, or their Faithfulness to deliver, what they heard from the beginning. Their Capacities and Parts their Writings publish; their Integri&rehy;ty and Honesty their Lives declared; nei&rehy;ther had they either reason, or advantage thus to cheat, or impose upon, the world. And therefore those Writers, who lived in the first Ages of Christianity, are first to be believed; that in difficulties and straits we are to have recourse unto; and conse&rehy;quently the later to be less confided in, <PB
N="25">as having met with greater and more sub&rehy;tile opposition, and therefore subject to more intermixtures of heat and passion; and like Rivers, the further off the Fountain, the less do they retain of their first purity, and the greater mingling of different wa&rehy;ters. As the nearer we are to the Fountain therefore, the clearer will the Stream be; so the nearer we Travel to that which was heard from the beginning, the more cer&rehy;tain and infallible will our Guide and Rule be. But because the reports and sayings of Fathers are like melted Wax that re&rehy;ceives the Image suitable to the Seal which makes the impression; and persons of di&rehy;vers Churches, and Persuasions, deal with their Sentences, as young Sophisters with a Text of <IT>Aristotle</IT>, by a distinction, or a figure, force them to countenance the va&rehy;rious Sentiments of their disturbed minds: If we rest here, we shall still be as far from the end of Controversie, as the Contro&rehy;versie from the beginning of Truth. To proceed further then, by the assistance of those means our Reason dictates, toge&rehy;ther with prayers and humility of mind, to <PB
N="26">the investigation of what we are to rest in, as that which was from the beginning. A General Council would quickly deter&rehy;mine it, did not an Empire now Canto&rehy;nized; the opposite Interest of Prin&rehy;ces among themselves; diversity of Fa&rehy;ctions sprung up among their Subjects; the great Prejudices that are in the world; and above all, over grown Popery, clear&rehy;ly obstruct its Justice and Freedom; and I might say, its Possibility too. As every Episcopal Church, therefore, was Planted, at the first, Independent of another; yet, to preserve a Church Catholic upon Earth, admitting an Universal Union, Correspon&rehy;dence, Advice; and, by consent, an Obli&rehy;gation upon particulars, by Authority from the whole. Every particular Episco&rehy;pal Church had a power of Discipline as well as Doctrine, committed to her trust and managery; the first Planters convey&rehy;ing downward, through a Sacred and un&rehy;interupted Succession, their Authority and Jurisdiction to this Age, and this Church, to which we now pretend a Rela&rehy;tion. In Controversie and difference (as <PB
N="27">the Case now stands with us) there can be no Example, or Rule, or more Rational Pat&rehy;tern, or Guide of Action, than that of the Primitive Planters of the Gospel; which is, that the Inferior be regulated by the Advice and Authority of the Superior, and all submit to the reasonable resolution of a National Council. Thus when the great dispute about Circumcision was raised at <IT>Antioch</IT>, the Metropolis of <IT>Syria</IT>, they Ap&rehy;pealed to <IT>Jerusalem</IT>, to which <IT>Antioch</IT> was subjected, being a place of Superior Juris&rehy;diction; and the determination of the Bi&rehy;shops of <IT>Judea</IT>, with <IT>Paul</IT> and <IT>Barnabas</IT>, Representatives of <IT>Antioch</IT>, fully silenced any farther Dispute, and was the infal&rehy;lible sentence in which they acquiesced. <IT>Acts</IT> 15.</P>
<P>But now, let not any men wonder that I call the Sentences of such Councils In&rehy;fallible; since 'tis only using a Popish word, to express Protestant sence, to our selves, which overthrows the <IT>Roman</IT> claims over us. For this being applied to our Coun&rehy;cils here; our Church neither erring in Fundamentals, nor pretending to usurp <PB
N="28">upon the Natural Priviledg of mankind to judge for themselves as far as they are capable; but only assists and helps their Understanding in what they are deficient for want of Education; creating no New Articles of Faith: nay imposing nothing on the belief of any, but what the Scrip&rehy;tures have Authorized before; and Or&rehy;daining nothing by its own power, but a limitation of the outward actions of men: its decrees in things that are thus the subject of human Laws, are either to be actually obeyed, or not publickly or tu&rehy;multuosly contradicted. And this is what I intend to be the sence of the Infallible Sentence of a National Council, without which, Controversie can never be ended, no Legislative Authority maintained, nor Peace and Order remain among us. For want of this moderate and sober apprehen&rehy;sion of things, men make themselves lya&rehy;ble to those Penalties of Laws which good natured Magistrates so unwillingly inflict, and well meaning Christians pity, and at the same time admire the Confi&rehy;dence of those who are so hardy, and <PB
N="29">willing to deserve them; especially when they consider, also, that the same persons can be tamely silent, in Forain Coun&rehy;tries where Principles of Religion more severely contradict the Sentiments of their minds.</P>
<P>'Tis true, indeed, a Council may err, unless they could put off their manhood, or to every decree have a fresh Inspiration, or receive a Divine Testimony from Hea&rehy;ven; and yet it is to us Infallible; (<IT>i.e.</IT>) to silence our open Disputes against it, and to be the Rule for our External Obedience. For frail men cannot possibly proceed far&rehy;ther in the searching out Divine Truths, than in the means, and way to find out the Revelation; and to understand it when it is found; leaving other indifferent things to the determination of those who have Autho&rehy;rity over us: and those means that I have mentioned seeming to be all that Reason and Discourse, when not disturb'd by Lu&rehy;nacy or Enthusiasm, are able to propose; and since the only Evidence we have to prove the objects of sense against the bold denial of a confident <IT>Sceptick</IT>, is to call <PB
N="30">in many, against the obstinacy of one, to give Testimony to what we see, or hear; and so to decide the difference betwixt us: If I err with submission to that Authority which I find the ultimate mean to deter&rehy;mine, my Crime, certainly, will not be so great, but a pardon will as necessarily at&rehy;tend it; since the most gracious God does not require my action to be beyond the Sphere of my capacity; nor my appre&rehy;hensions to exceed the Powers of my be&rehy;ing. But the Authority of Councils, as hitherto stated, may seem too naked to be submitted to; and yet we observed in the first times, a ready obedience to their de&rehy;crees, when backed by no Secular Power: If therefore they were obliging then, they engage us by another addition, and are strengthened by a Civil Sanction. For as, when the Emperors became Christians; what was before Established by our Savi&rehy;our and his Apostles, and asserted by Pi&rehy;ous Bishops, and Divines Congregated for that purpose, and drawn into Sacred Ca&rehy;nons, or Rules, received a Sanction from the Legislative Power resident on Earth; <PB
N="31">and were so embodyed with Imperial Laws, that the Magistrate was <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Custos utriusque Tabul&aelig;</FOREIGN>: so the Protestant Church, among our selves, has its Foundations, in the Word of God, (derived downward from prime Antiquity) so inlaid with the Tem&rehy;poral Laws of our own Kingdom, that the one cannot be invaded with Triumph, but the other nods; nay totters, till it falls in&rehy;to inevitable ruine; and we need not a new Experiment to shew it. This every one, at length, believes, that is not, by being engaged in past mischiefs, an enemy to both, and like <IT>Cataline</IT>, resolved on fu&rehy;ture evils to justifie, or secure, those that are past. But they, more distinctly, are acquainted with this, who are Learned in the Laws, than we, who being Divines, are willingly supposed ignorant of them. Yet this seems to be the great Reason why such as design to invade the Crown, make a pass at the Miter first, because the Church is a Guard to the Palace, as well as the Palace a defence to the Church. Till this therefore be wounded, or removed, the disturbers of the Peace <PB
N="32">of both, cannot, in probability, ascend the Throne, nor place a Duke of <IT>Venice</IT> there.</P>
<P>But, to return from this digression; a National Council ought more especially to determine the Controversies among us, so as to oblige us to Peace, because their De&rehy;crees are our own Acts, having chosen the persons who represent us in it. Yet to si&rehy;lence doubts, and scruples, about this matter: whatever regard we may all have to tender Consciences, that are not raw; the different thoughts of Worship among us, being such as produce squabble and contentions, these, for our necessary ease and pleasure, dividing us into separated Clans; and these making us fit for Conspi&rehy;racy, which, without any more Devils than our selves, may advance it self into an actual Rebellion: And when vari&rehy;ous, and severe Contests about Religion have openly distinguished men from each other, till they are hardly able to know themselves; when private Dispensations, shall, in some cases, vacat Publick Oaths by single Interpretations, and in Equivo<PB
N="33">cations, and Mental Reservations men are able to out-strip the Jesuit himself; this is a way to remove the Pope, only by bring&rehy;ing him into our own Bellies, and in&rehy;stead of a Union of Protestants among our selves, is the direct way to introduce Popery in Masquerade (that I may use some Rhetorical words) and to imbrace what we declame against, and every Pro&rehy;testant is bound in his own capacity, to withstand. But when Trade and Occupa&rehy;tions determine our Option, and past Acts (though evil in themselves) must regulate our present, and future, deportment: when persons chuse their Articles of Creed, as well as various ways of Worship, suit&rehy;able to what they gain from those with whom they seem Religiously to associ&rehy;ate: Conscience and Christianity do no longer guide them, but they give away their choice to Clients, Trade, and (a&rehy;mongst Divines) to the preferments of this World; and, all this while, 'tis Earth becomes their Supreme God, and Secular Interest governs their Religion. When Affairs therefore, through our own indis<PB
N="34">cretion, or the wickedness of others, are brought to this pass, that men will vio&rehy;late their Oaths to preserve Religion, or neglect Prayers to serve God; or attend Prayers to serve the Devil, and when, by such methods as these, the Prologue is made to the dismal Tragedy of a general Confusion, 'tis time to call for a solemn Consultation and for a Christian Magistrate to interpose by Law, least the Disorders in what we call by the Ancient and Vene&rehy;rable name of Religion, may have too se&rehy;vere an influence on the State, and both be ruined by the same hands; since these are like <IT>Hypocrates</IT> Twins, that weep and laugh both together. 'Tis time therefore (at such a Season) to call upon our sleep&rehy;ing Laws to awake, whose Penalties have an equal Sanction with themselves: and more especially, because punishment of Extravagant Offendors can be no Perse&rehy;cution, when the Christian Religion is not concerned, but the various Interests of this World; and Penalties (in this Case) will only restrain the inordinate Affection of some men to their private <PB
N="35">Concerns in relation to their abode here; and teach them how to be Crucified to this World, that they may more easily ascend into Glory in the next. 'Twill keep them steady whilst they walk upon the Earth, when the Wings of their Ambition are clyp'd and pois'd; and cause them to grow better, by Religion, and Loyalty; that by a peaceable de&rehy;parture out of this Life they may enter into the Joy of our Lord. This (though, to some, it may seem severe) can be no violence offered to Conscience, where we plainly see there is none at all. 'Twill be at most, no more than a limitation of Trade and Covetousness, by restraining the Contentions and Ambition of mankind. And now, if upon all this Dis&rehy;course, a carping <IT>Protestant</IT>, or angry <IT>Ro&rehy;manist</IT>, should blunder upon this Objection; that if the Church be infallible, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">quoad nos</FOREIGN>; so it was at the time of our withdrawing from the <IT>Roman</IT> Communion, and there&rehy;fore we then breaking the Principal Bond of Truth and Union, must remain guilty of the greatest Shism, unless we return to that <PB
N="36">Church from whence we have departed. It is, without any difficulty, replied, that he supposes that granted which we will not yield; for we were never lawfully subject to the <IT>Roman</IT> Church, in respect of Spiritu&rehy;als, any more than we were to the late Monster of Traytors, in respect of Tem&rehy;porals: a prosperous Usurpation giving them no better Title over our Church, which was distinct at its first reception of Christianity, than the others possession gave him right to his Sovereigns Throne; both being effected, by Subtilty, Force, and Usurpation.</P>
<P>Thus having, through this Discourse, ex&rehy;hibited a great Character of Truth, which is prime Antiquity; and given some slen&rehy;der account of what has been heard from the beginning: All that remains is to in&rehy;force the Apostles Exhortation to the du&rehy;ty, and beg that ancient Truths may a&rehy;bide in you. We have now had the Tryal of all things, let us therefore hold fast that which is good: we have been too long tossed in a storm, but having at last, ar&rehy;rived at a safe Harbour, let us no more sail <PB
N="37">out among the Rocks, nor put to Sea whilst the Winds rage, and the Waves roar. The True, Ancient, and Apostolick Faith was, for some time, like the lost sheep; it wan&rehy;dred about in a Wilderness of Error, and the by Paths of Heresie and Schism, being torn and scratched with Briars and Thorns, not only till it was smeered with blood, but at last it became Naked Truth: Naked, indeed; for being void of Hypocrisie, it became Naked of Friends too: But now, since we have found the lost sheep no wonder that I Exhort you, as he did his Friends in the Gospel; <Q
REND="it">Rejoyce with me for I have found the sheep that was lost.</Q> And since the search has been no less tedious, than in these times, full of hazard; let us no longer shift the Principles of our Religion, nor permit the wry Face of a man to draw our Souls and Bodies asside; but let those Truths abide in us which we have heard from the begining. Why should I use any Rhetorick to per&rehy;suade, when there is the Authority of God to command? <IT>Tacitus</IT> informs us of <IT>C&aelig;sar's</IT> Soldiers; <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Imperium potius quam concilium sequebantur</FOREIGN>; A word of Command was <PB
N="38">more to them than persuasion or advice in a formal Speech. And shall we that march under our Saviours Banner be more diso&rehy;bedient than a Heathen Militia? Why should we not for Edification submit to true Decency and Order, that we may no longer be like <IT>Samaritans</IT> and <IT>Jews</IT>, re&rehy;fuse kinder Correspondences with each other? As the Apostle therefore Exhorts those <IT>Jews</IT>, who, though dispersed, were uni&rehy;ted in Christian Faith and Discipline: so let me, with all Charity and Affection beg, that you would hold fast your Profession (<IT>Heb.</IT> 4.14.) Can we reasonably part with the Glorious Gospel which promises Crowns and everlasting Rewards; that takes care of us after we are Dead, and leaves us neither in Purgatory or the Grave; nay, that free us from the Tor&rehy;ments of Hell, and advances us to the Joys of Heaven: We cannot once depart from our Religion, but at the same time we a&rehy;bandon our selves, exchange our Reason for Folly and Madness, and barter our precious Souls for trifles; and what pro&rehy;portion in this exchange? <Q
REND="it">What is a man <PB N="39">profited</Q> (says our Saviour) nay, how is a man utterly undon if, <Q
REND="it">to gain the whole world, he loses his own soul?</Q> (Matth. 16.26.) Un&rehy;derstand what you are capable of appre&rehy;hending, and when you have found a Do&rehy;ctrine to be sound, take St. <IT>Pauls</IT> advice to <IT>Timothy;</IT> <Q
REND="it">Hold fast the form of sound words</Q>, (1.<IT>Tim.</IT> 1.13.) Many of our fierce and staring Seperatists, like their Ancestors of another denomination (the <IT>Papists</IT> I mean) embrace Principles and Ways of Wor&rehy;ship, though they understand them not. As <IT>Quintilian</IT> speaking of the <IT>Toscan</IT> Rights and the Soothsayings of the <IT>Salian</IT> Priests, <FOREIGN
REND="it" LANG="LAT">Vix Sacerdotibus suis intellecta, sed qu&aelig; mu&rehy;tari vetat Religio</FOREIGN>. Scarce apprehended by their Priests themselves, but yet their Prin&rehy;ciples and Religion forbid a change. But that Gospel which has been heard from the beginning, is no Airy Doctrine to be con&rehy;densed into a Cloud; nor so hot, as to be raised into a Pillar of Fire: we are not to be conducted as the <IT>Israelites</IT> were of old; nor, thanks be to God, and a Christian Government, is the Church yet in a Wil&rehy;derness condition; our Principles are as <PB
N="40">Plain as Honest; and our Religion as In&rehy;telligible, as it is Rational; and the Do&rehy;ctrine and Discipline, if our Practice Cor&rehy;responds, which the Church of <IT>England</IT> pretends a reverence for; by Gods bles&rehy;sing, being submitted to with meekness, will be sufficient to save our Souls, through him who first published it to the World, and died to make satisfaction for our sins. Let this therefore abide in you; that you may not be, like Waves of the Sea, al&rehy;ways rolling, and driven which way a Storm pleases; but setled, and immova&rehy;ble, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; which let God Cooperate and strengthen you in, for Christ Jesus's sake; <IT>To whom with the Father and his Eternal Spi&rehy;rit, be all Glory, and Honour, now, and for ever</IT>.
