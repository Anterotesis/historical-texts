<HEAD REND="ro">To His Excellency <BO>ARTHUR</BO> Earl of ESSEX,
Viscount <IT>Malden</IT>, Baron <IT>Capel</IT> of <IT>Hadham</IT>,
Lord Lieutenant General, and General Go&rehy;vernour of His Majesties
Kingdom of <IT>Ireland</IT>, Lord Lieutenant of the County of <IT>Hartford</IT>,
and one of the Lords of His Majesties most Honourable Privy Coun&rehy;cil
of both Kingdoms.</HEAD>
<SALUTE REND="ro">Most Honourable,
</SALUTE>
<P>&Hic;OW much <RO>Ireland</RO> (happy in your Government) is above
all other Nations in <RO>Europe</RO>, influenced by the power of <RO>Rome</RO>,
is to Your Excellency well known, as to the world, and by themselves
also acknowledged, and gloried in.
</P>
<P>But unhappy is it in being thereby, and by <RO>Romish</RO>
Emissaries (of malevolent and factious principles promoting other
interesses) carried on fatally, to the disturbance of the peace of the
Kingdom. Of this we have had Memorials of former Ages, some of them
fresh and bleeding; nor are we even now without jealousies of what may
yet be, were there opportunity for it.</P>
<P>This is not to be ascribed to the stars, or clime, or nature of the
people, who have had of old the character, justly, of a people peace&rehy;able,
harmless, affable to strangers, and in themselves, and to all, pious
<PB N="[iii]">and good. So was it, while the Religion professed by
their Forefa&rehy;thers was according to the primitive faith of purer
times of the Church (although not then without some soil.) And thus find
we it even now in those of the Nation who are of reformed and purer
principles.</P>
<P>But being in after times corrupted in Doctrine and Discipline, and
that the now Religion of the <RO>Irish</RO> is quite another thing from
that of their forefathers (of whom yet they boast themselves Children,
both as to faith and blood) we now find the Change great, as in
Religion, so in disposition and manners:</P>
<P>On which we collect, that the grounds of our peace from those, must
not be <RO>Extirpation</RO>, but <RO>Reformation</RO>, by removing
those of their false Teachers, who mis-inform and mis-lead the Nation;
and our withal instructing the people in the waies of peace and truth.</P>
<P>As to the latter I have observed, no people more desirous than are
these to hear and to be instructed, nor any better, being so educated.</P>
<P>In which I cannot but mention and recommend as a president to o&rehy;thers,
the zeal of a pious and learned Prelate, the present <RO>Archbishop</RO>
of <RO>Cashel</RO>, who has set himself on that work industriously by
instruct&rehy;ing the <RO>Irish</RO> in their own language; and hath
already gathered the comfortable fruits of his godly labours, drawing in
and retaining ma&rehy;ny of the Nation firm in the faith, the number
also of such encreasing.</P>
<P>The means for that in former times, and in some of our own me&rehy;mories,
was the translating and Printing our <RO>English</RO> Lyturgy, and the
New Testament into the <RO>Irish</RO> tongue, that testifying our care
of their salvation, and giving them thereby to understand in their own
language the truth we profess and teach, contrary to the mis-informa&rehy;tion
of others concerning us.</P>
<P>And to this purpose that learned Prelate Doctor <RO>Bedell</RO>
late Bishop of <RO>Kilmore</RO> (happy in his Zeal and labours that
way) to that of the <RO>New Testament</RO> and <RO>Common-Prayer</RO>
before translated and Printed in the <RO>Irish</RO> tongue, did add the
<RO>Translation into Irish of the Old Testament</RO> also, with <RO>David's
Psalms in meter</RO> This I have in my hands in the manuscript, and wish
it were for such a publick good, printed and published.</P>
<PB N="[iv]">
<P>In the mean time, to give some stop, if it might be, to the Current
of Popery, I conceived it might be convenient and necessary that it be
known and declared to this mis-lead people, as to others, <RO>who that
is whom they so follow, that he is that very Antichrist, by whom they
may be carried away by that deluge of Apostacy into perdition</RO>,
wherby these may by grace be brought to consider their waies.
</P>
<P>This is that which is in the following Treatise intended, and is, I
hope to some evidenced, which appearing, other points and erroneous
Doctrines of Popery will fall, depending on that the principal.</P>
<P>Of this in my late preaching it, I had the honour of your Excellen&rehy;cies
being then an hearer; and being prevailed with after for publish&rehy;ing
it, I thought it fittest for your Lordships Patronage, in whose hand is
the Government of that people for whom this is particularly design&rehy;ed.
it was a confident presumption in him, who under the letter <RO>I. S.</RO>
(it may be, far from his name) did <RO>offer to your Patronage an in&rehy;vective
against that Church of which you are, The Church of</RO> England <RO>your
Mother, as not being the Church of Christ, nor any part of it</RO>;
which had its full confutation by a learned piece, Doctor <RO>Andrew
Sall</RO>, I hope the contrary may find better acceptance from your
Excellency, this shewing <RO>that the Church of</RO> Rome, <RO>of
which J. S. shews himself to be, is <SC>Antichristian</SC>, and
communion there to be unto some dangerous, and damnable to others</RO>.</P>
<P>It is in this my Comfort, which was St. <RO>Paul's</RO> speaking
before King <RO>Agrippa</RO>) that I <RO>speak to one who knoweth
these things. And from whom I am perswaded (none of these things are
hidden</RO>, Acts 26.3.26.) For your Excellency is not a favourer only
of Learn&rehy;ing, but you your self also learned eminently, and
particularly versed in Church Antiquities, on which most of that here
spoken, is depend&rehy;ing.</P>
<P>Which your affection to Learning appears in your large collection of
Books, with which that your rich and compleat Library in <RO>England</RO>
is stored. The fame of which hath crossed the Seas hither, as elsewhere
a&rehy;broad. There may the learned find knowledge in variety, beside
what con&rehy;cerns Records both of <RO>England</RO> and <RO>Ireland</RO>,
such as are not other<PB N="[v]">where, unto which recourse may be had
as to a <RO><SC>Vatican</SC></RO>.</P>
<P>And as to <RO>Ireland</RO>, considering the few years of your
Government over us, I dare confidently aver, that none, so as your
Lordship, know&rehy;eth so much of the Kingdom, People, Manners, and
several Interesses there, and understands better the Measures, for
governing answerably; and such a person so knowing, this Kingdom
requires.</P>
<P>In your Excellency shines the Heroick Vertue and Courage of that
renowned Martyr for King and Country, your illustrious Father; and that
well tempered with your own personal Affability taking with, and
obliging all; yet to each with a becoming distance of state and place,
so as none to presume on more than just favour in Judgment, Ju&rehy;stice
being to all, and any without difference dispensed.</P>
<P><LB><FOREIGN REND="ro" LANG="LAT">Tros Tyriusve tibi nullo

</P>
<P>This is now testified in the present <RO>Connaght Court of Claymes</RO>
under your Government the <RO>Irish</RO> in that Province, having
therein their help, as had before the other parts of the Kingdom their
distri&rehy;bution of Lands in former Courts of like nature. In which
those of <RO>Connaght</RO> having been post-poned, they were given over
as re&rehy;mediless, until by his gracious Majesties continual care of
his People they were thus considered, and that by your Lordships
procurement and management.</P>
<P>God multiply his blessings on you in your Person, and in your
Excellent Lady, and Noble Progeny; and make us happy in the continuance
of your prosperous Government, generally desired; which are the prayers

<P>THat between the first and second coming of Christ the Church being

should arise a certain per&rehy;son notoriously wicked, an adversary to
Christ, an a cruel persecutor of the Church, whom the Scripture 1 <IT>John</IT>

<P><IT>And whereas the Apostles speak of a</IT> Mystery of iniquity
even then in those very times, working (2 <IT>Thes.</IT> 2.7.) <IT>and
that many</IT> Antichrists were then in the world (2 <IT>John v.</IT>

his time to be revealed (2 <IT>Thessal.</IT> 2.5. 1 <IT>John</IT>

<P REND="it">The knowledge of which <RO>Gradual Comming of Antichrist</RO>
leads us to the better understanding him as to his Person and Appearing:

<ITEM><LABEL>2.</LABEL> <IT>His after-appearing in the world</IT>.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. <IT>The</IT> Preparations to his Comming, <IT>or his being</IT>
conceived, <IT>and but yet an</IT> Embrio in the womb's, <IT>may be
those first times, when that</IT> ini&rehy;quity did work but in a
Mystery <IT>that is</IT> not yet so openly, <IT>as after, and</IT>
<PB N="[vii]">Antichrist <IT>not</IT> himself <IT>yet appearing, but</IT>

<IT>and from their</IT> number many Antichrists; <IT>and from their</IT>
chief <IT>called also</IT>, the Spirit of Antichrist who was to come, (<IT>John</IT>

<P>This period of time <IT>may be extended to</IT> the first 600 years
of the Church, <IT>of which although the first</IT> 300 <IT>be
acknowledged the purer, yet do the later</IT> 300, <IT>and the whole</IT>
600, <IT>pass generally under the name of</IT> pure, <IT>compared with
the following</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>In which</IT> 600 <IT>years it is granted, that many Errours
did creep in&rehy;to the Church; For while the</IT> husbandmen slept,
<IT>or were less vigilant, the</IT> enemy sowed Tares among the Wheat,
both growing together, <IT>as our Lord had forewarned, (Matth.</IT>
13.24, <IT>to</IT> 31.) <IT>yet it is not&rehy;withstanding
confidently averred</IT>, that within those 600 years there was not one
in the whole world might be properly called a Papist , <IT>saith our

<IT>For as the</IT> Title of Pope <IT>was not yet appropriated by and
to the</IT> Bishops of Rome, <IT>nor the name</IT> Papist <IT>from
them derived to their followers; so</IT> those Errours <IT>before
stolen in, and crept into the Church</IT>, were not then received, nor
passed for Truths; <IT>some of them being taken notice of</IT>, were
opposed both in the Eastern and Western Churches, particularly in <IT>France,

<P><IT>This was not to be expected within those first</IT> 600 <IT>years
of the Church when was wanting</IT> an Universal Bishop and Pope, <IT>by
whose power a</IT> Council might be ordered <IT>to adopt those growing
Errours for Truths, which after followed. For at the end of that sixth

<P>1. Antichrists Infant age, <IT>is what next followeth, and may be
sta&rehy;ted in the year</IT> 607, <IT>Boniface</IT> 3. who by favour
of <IT>Phocas the</IT> Emperor <IT>obtained and assumed the title of</IT>
Universal Bishop, or Pope, <IT>which had been ambitiously sought after
by</IT> John Patriarch of Constanti<PB N="[viii]">nople, <IT>as what
he thought was belonging to</IT> the chief seat of the Em&rehy;pire
<IT>Constantinople, which his so invading</IT> that proud title <IT>was,
by Gre&rehy;gory</IT> the great Bishop of <IT>Rome, declared</IT> a
sign of Antichrist's being then at hand, <IT>& that</IT> whosoever
assumed that title was Antichrist or a forerunner of Antichrist: <IT>not
dreaming how near that by him so spoken was to himself. For while he was
eyeing another person, and place this was soon after found</IT> in his
own See of <IT>Rome, and, there, in his very next successor but one</IT>,
Boniface. 3. <IT>he Arrogating that high name of</IT> Universal Bishop,
<IT>not content with</IT> Primacy <IT>without</IT> Suprema&rehy;cy:
<IT>not satisfied</IT> with being first among the five Patriarchs,
<IT>but to be</IT> above them also, <IT>and they sub&rehy;jected to
him, and his rule, so he to be over all Bishops, and the Church
throughout the whole World subjected to him as chief</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>And here see, how near the</IT> Pope's two <IT>so contrary
Titles came in, and began almost together, that of</IT>
<FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Servus Servorum Dei</FOREIGN> <IT>by</IT> Gregory;
<IT>and</IT> Universal Bishop <IT>by</IT> Boniface his successor.</P>
<P><IT>That also</IT> Antichrist had scarcely begun to shew himself in
this Western part of the World at <IT>Rome, as now in</IT> Boniface
<IT>when</IT> near upon that time Mahomet the false Prophet began to
appear in the East, <IT>both to the bane of the Church: the famous
Churches in the East suppressed by the one; and those in the West
corrupted by the other</IT>.</P>
<P>2. <IT>Yet</IT> was this but Antichrist's infancy; <IT>we have yet
to see him in</IT> his full growth of strength and stature <IT>under
following Popes, especially in</IT> <CORR SIC="Gregoy">Gregory</CORR>
7th. <IT>before called</IT> Hildebrand, <IT>who inlarged the Papal</IT>
power <IT>above all</IT> spiritual <IT>and</IT> temporal, <IT>not
only</IT> Bishops, <IT>but even</IT> Emperours also being <IT>brought
under him</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>As to the time of</IT> Gregory <IT>the</IT> 7ths <IT>Papacy,
which was</IT> about a thousand years from the destruction of <IT>Jerusalem</IT>
and Temple, by the <IT>Romans</IT>: In <IT>which time of the</IT>
destruction of <IT>Jerusalem was that</IT> Fulness of Christ's Kingdom,
and its coming in power; <IT>That is, the</IT> Gospel preached to other
Nations, <IT>and Jerusalem</IT> trodden down of the <IT>Gentiles,
(Luke</IT> 21.24.) <IT>Thereby also were the Temple, Jewish service,
worship and sacrifices taken out of the way, which, for a time, were
hindrances to the course of the Gospel</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>In this Christ's Kingdom of the Gospel so come there was to be
also a</IT> binding up of Satan for a thousand years <IT>after, so as
the</IT> Devil <IT>should be restrained</IT>, not in <IT>that time, to</IT>
seduce the world <IT>so freely, and so gene<PB N="[ix]">rally as
before, Rev.</IT> 20.1,2,3.) after which thousand years, Satan was to be
again at liberty, for mischief, <IT>which</IT> loosing of Satan <IT>was
the</IT> period of Antichrists being also at liberty, he coming with the
work&rehy;ing of Satan (2 <IT>Thes.</IT> 2.9. Satan <IT>and</IT>
Antichrist <IT>working by and for each other) Which</IT> thousand years
were then compleated in the Papacy of <IT>Gregory</IT> the 7th. <IT>mentioned</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>And it may be observed in this, what is also found in other
great Prophecies</IT>, that about the time of their fulfilling mens
minds have been then stirred up as by instinct to enquire after that
which was to be about that time expected.</P>
<P><IT>So was it about</IT> the time of the 70 years captivity, <IT>which
when at hand</IT>, Daniel <IT>is then more than before inquisitive and
look&rehy;ing after it's accomplishing</IT> (Dan. 9.23)</P>
<P><IT>So also when the</IT> fulness of time came <IT>for</IT>
Christs coming into the world (<IT>Gal.</IT> 4.4.) <IT>how were men
then more especially awakened for</IT> looking after any waiting in
<IT>Jerusalem</IT> for the salvation of <IT>Israel, (Luke</IT>
2.25.38.) <IT>so as when any eminent person appeared that might carry
any likelyhood for it; as</IT> Iohn B. <IT>he was</IT> sent unto,
solemnly to <IT>satisfy</IT> whether he were the Christ (<IT>Joh.</IT>
1.19,20:) <IT>so</IT> when the thousand years for Satans loosing, <IT>and</IT>
Antichrists consequently appearing , were expired, the expectations of
some were then greater, <IT>they ear&rehy;nestly enquiring</IT> whether
Antichrist was yet come? or when? <IT>As</IT> to the letter (saith
<IT>Richardus Victorinus</IT>) these thousand years are alrea&rehy;dy
expired, yet when Antichrist shall come, and Satan be loosed, we know
not. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="margin"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT"><IT>Rich.
Victor. in Apocal. l.</IT></FOREIGN> 6. c. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P><IT>Which mens</IT> not knowing Antichrist when come, and present,
and seen, <IT>and (by the time for his coming elapsed) concluded as</IT>
come. <IT>In that we see but what was, as to</IT> Christ himself. <IT>For
the time for his com&rehy;ing being fulfilled and he present in the
world, and seen and speaking dayly with them</IT>, yet was not known (<IT>Joh</IT>.
1.10,11.) <IT>but</IT> still <IT>expect&rehy;ed. So was it as to</IT>
Christ's Kingdom also; <IT>he himself being interrogated</IT>, when the
King&rehy;dom of God should come, <IT>he answered</IT> that the Kingdom
of God is within you, <IT>that is</IT> among you; <IT>that which they
saw not, was even then present, and with them, (Luk.</IT> 17.20,21.)
<IT>meaning</IT> his Kingdom of the Gospel: <IT>so were enquiries
after</IT> Antichrists comings when he was already come, <IT>yet not
observed</IT>.</P>
<P REND="it">But although some were then so to seek, as to <RO>Antichrist</RO>,
not knowing <PB N="[x]">or seeing him when present and to be seen, yet
was it not so with all; he being understood of others otherwise, so as
even to be pointed at, and de&rehy;clared as to his place and person.</P>
<P><IT>Particularly, as to</IT> Gregory the 7th. <IT>or</IT>
Hildebrand, <IT>of whom</IT> Ebe&rehy;rardus in Aventinus <IT>thus
speaketh. Hildebrand</IT> one hundred and se&rehy;venty years since, was
the first, who under colour of Religion laid the foundation of <IT>Antichrists
Empire</IT>. Those Babylonian Priests would reign alone, and equal they
cannot endure, they cease not to trample all under foot; <IT>they sit
in the Temple of God</IT>, and are exalted above all that is worshiped;
he who stiles himself Servant of Ser&rehy;vants, is Lord of Lords, as if
he were God. He frames to himself an Empire changing Laws; he
establisheth his own, he corrupts, robs, spoils, defrauds, kills, that
man of perdition whom they are wont to call Antichrist, in whose
forehead that name of contumely is writ&rehy;ten, I am God, I cannot
erre; he sitteth in the Temple of God ru&rehy;ling all and every-where;
many say that <IT>Gregory</IT> is Antichrist.

<P>He to whom all these agree, and in whom all meet together, is that
<IT>Man of Sin, this Son of perdition</IT> whom we now seek after.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV><HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><IT>His condition and quality</IT> is herein to be first
considered; that <IT>he is a Man of Sin</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>A Man of Sin</IT> is a Scripture-form of speaking for <IT>one
above others sinful</IT>. The word <IT>sinner</IT>, sometimes imports
the <IT>greater sort of sin&rehy;ners</IT>; and where the word sinners
is first found in Scripture (<IT>Gen</IT>. 13.13.) it is said of
Monsters of sin, <IT>those of</IT> Sodom <IT>who were sin&rehy;ners
before the Lord exceedingly</IT>. And surely <IT>a Man of Sin</IT>, in&rehy;tends
something more than a <IT>sinner. Beza</IT> renders it
<FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">merum sce&rehy;lus</FOREIGN>, meer or
very wickedness. <IT>A Man of Sin</IT> (saith <IT>Grotius) sig&rehy;nifieth
some person notably and above all others wicked</IT>.</P>
<P>And accordingly is this <IT>Man of Sin</IT> here <IT>one above
others sinful</IT>, both in <IT>life</IT> and <IT>profession.
Therefore</IT> called <IT>spiritually Sodom, (Rev.</IT> 11.8.) and as
<IT>to Faith and Doctrine</IT>; An <IT>Apo&rehy;state</IT> (and what
is in that kind worse?) <IT>falling away (v.</IT> 3.) <IT>departing
from the Faith</IT> (1 <IT>Tim.</IT> 4.1.) <IT>denying the Lord that
bought them</IT>, and <IT>bringing in damnable Heresies</IT> (2 <IT>Pet.</IT>
2.1.) and <IT>Doctrines of Devils, forbidding to marry, and commanding
<PB N="3">to abstain from meats</IT>, & c. (1 <IT>Tim.</IT> 4.1, 2,3.)
we know who do so. Of these Apostate Professors are those also of whom
St. <IT>John</IT> speaketh <Q REND="it">who de&rehy;ny that Jesus is
the Christ</Q>; adding, <Q REND="it">he is an Antichrist that denyeth
the Father and the Son, whosoever denyeth the Son hath not the Father</Q>
(1 <IT>John</IT> 2. 22, 23.) And <Q REND="it">every spirit that
confesseth not, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God;
and this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it
should come, and even now already, is it in the world</Q> (1. <IT>John</IT>
4.3. Not that <IT>Antichrist, or</IT> every <IT>Antichrist, denyeth
Christ come in the flesh</IT>; Some did so; nor do all hereticks speak
the same thing, but <IT>whosoever shall say that Christ is not come in
the flesh is an Antichrist</IT>.</P>
<P>In all is to be observed,</P>
<LIST><ITEM><P>1. <IT>That all false doctrines and heresies</IT>,
whether against <IT>the doctrine and truth of Christ</IT>, of which the
<IT>Apostle S. Paul</IT> speaks (1. <IT>Tim.</IT> 4.) or <IT>against
Christ's person or Natures</IT>, of whom St. John <IT>speaks; both
these are against Christ</IT>, and such as so teach and believe, are
therefore (because <IT>against Christ) Antichrist</IT>, so as <IT>every
deceiver is an Antichrist</IT> (2. <IT>John</IT> v. 7.) <Q REND="it">I
Judg</Q> (saith St. Hierom) <Q REND="it">all chief hereticks to be An&rehy;tichrist,
under the name of <RO>Christ</RO> teaching contrary to <RO>Christ</RO>.<GAP DESC="note" REASON="illegible">
</Q></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>2. Hereby we find that there are <IT>many Antichrists</IT>
(1 <IT>John</IT> 2. 18) and of those many that <IT>some</IT> were
then, in the Apostles. dayes, in the world. (1. <IT>John</IT> 4. 3.)
<IT>Apostates from the faith</IT> before professed; <Q REND="it">They
went from us, but were not of us</Q> saith the Apostle (1. <IT>John</IT>
2.18,19.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>3. Observe, <IT>that among those many Antichrists</IT> there is
<IT>one chief Antichrist</IT>, see both in 1. <IT>John</IT> 2. 18.
<Q REND="it">little children, it is the last time, as ye have heard,
that Antichrist shall come; even now are there many Antichrists.</Q>
</P><P>In this we find those <IT>two sorts of Antichrists</IT>
distinguished. 1. <IT>In number: Antichrists</IT> plurally, And <IT>many
Antichrists</IT>; the other but <IT>Antichrist</IT> singly: one among
many. 2. These two also are distinguished <IT>in time</IT>, Of those
many some <IT>already come</IT>, and <IT>then in the World</IT>; but
<IT>that one Antichrist then not yet come</IT>, yet expected (2 <IT>Thess</IT>.
2.) <IT>the revealed in his time</IT> (v. 7.8.) 3. see that one and
chief Antichrist a&rehy;bove the rest pointed at Emphatically, <IT>by
an Article</IT> which is in the <IT>Greek</IT>; not expressed in our
<IT>English</IT> <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">Ho antichristos</FOREIGN> that
<IT>Article</IT> <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">Ho antichristos</FOREIGN> <IT>or
that Antichrist</IT> (saith <IT>Grotius) points at some one Antichrist
among those many more noted</IT>. And with like Emphasis is this <IT>man</IT>
of sin, in the Text expressed by <IT>that man of sin, The Son of
perdition</IT> <PB N="4">(v. 3.) <IT>That wicked</IT> (v. 8) and even
him, <IT>whose coming is after the working of Satan</IT> (v. 9.)</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>4. Observe that great <IT>Antichrist</IT> in S. John, and
this <IT>man of Sin</IT> in <IT>S. Paul</IT> to be intended of the
same Person; <Q REND="it">none can doubt but that St. Paul doth speak
these things of Antichrist</Q> saith S. Augustine.

called <IT>Sodom</IT> and <IT>Egypt (Rev.</IT> II. 8. the <IT>great</IT>

man of sin</IT> (5) and by St. John, <IT>Antichrist</IT>. In which
variety of names, some one is at present to be principally used, for
avoiding confusion; in which I shall choose that of <IT>Antichrist</IT>,
as being a word both Scriptural, and <IT>Ecclesiastical</IT>,
frequently occurring in the <IT>Fathers</IT>, and <IT>Ecclesiastical</IT>
writers, ancient and modern.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><P>5. Observe that <IT>man of Sin</IT> or <IT>Antichrist</IT>,
although singularly, and Emphatically, and as it were, personally
pointed at, is <IT>not not&rehy;withstanding to be understood as
terminated in any one individual person whatsoever</IT>; but as those
many <IT>Antichrists</IT> make up that wicked society of Apostate
Hereticks, of what kind soever; so is this <IT>great Anti&rehy;christ</IT>
A chief of his great Apostacy, but <IT>as one in succession</IT>,
though <IT>diverse</IT> in person, so it is said of the
<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="margin"><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Aug. triumph. de

Papacy That as to the place and office of the Papacy all Popes from

alone</IT>, but of <IT>any and all in that succesion</IT>.</P></ITEM></LIST>
<P>Thus of <IT>Antichrist</IT>, as here <IT>considered</IT> in his
<IT>person, condition and quality. A man of Sin</IT>, one <IT>in
profession and faith</IT>, also in <IT>life and manners sinful
exceedingly</IT>; and how that is, will appear after in particulars.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV><HEAD>II. </HEAD>
<P>We have next to see <IT>this man of sin</IT>, as to his <IT>place</IT>,
where he should appear, and is to be expected; <IT>sitting in the
Temple of God</IT>.</P>
<P>Which words The <IT>Temple of God</IT>, some appropriate to <IT>Jerusalem</IT>,
and the <Q REND="it">Temple there, so understood properly</Q> (saith
Grotius) <Q REND="it">in both Testaments</Q>
<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="margin">Grot. <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">de Antichrist</FOREIGN></NOTE>
It seems also to make for this; what is instanced of <IT>Cajus</IT> one
of the Roman Emperours, who caused his <IT>Image or statue to be placed
in the Temple at Jerusalem</IT> to be worshipped: which agrees (say
some) with the Text literally, <IT>This man of sin, sitting in the
temple of God</IT> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="5">
<P>But this <IT>man of sin, or Antichrist</IT>, is intended of an
<IT>Apostate Chri&rehy;stian fallen away</IT> (v. 3.) such as <IT>was
not Caius</IT>, a Pagan, and never other&rehy;wise, therefore not he
this Antichrist.
</P>
<P>2. Nor is <IT>Antichrist</IT> one individual person, but a chief in
succession; heading an Antichristian State and Faction, therefore not
<IT>Caius</IT> nor <IT>Simon Magus</IT>, or any other such whosoever;
which will after appear more fully.</P>
<P>3. <IT>The Temple of God</IT> in the Text is interpreted the <IT>Christian
Church</IT>, by the Fathers St. <IT>Augustin, Chrysostom, Hierome,
Hilary, Theophylact, Theodoret</IT>, and others; also by <IT>Thomas
Aquinas</IT> and others of the Schoolmen.</P>
<P>4. Notwithstanding what is confidently averred by some, <IT>that in
both Testaments, the Temple of God is intended of that Temple in Jeru&rehy;salem</IT>,
the contrary appears; and that the Christian Church is also in that
pointed at in <IT>both Testaments</IT>. So in <IT>Zech.</IT> 6. 12,
13. <Q REND="it">Behold the man whose name is the Branch</Q> (meant of
Christ, <IT>Zech.</IT> 3. 8. <IT>Isa.</IT> 14, 1. <IT>Jer.</IT> 3,
8.33.15.) <Q REND="it">he shall grow out of his place, and he shall
build the Temple of the Lord, even he shall build the Temple of the
Lord, and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his
throne.</Q> In which is not intended <IT>the Temple of Jerusalem</IT>,
as if built by Christ, whose de&rehy;struction he declared; those dayes
also of its destruction being the time of the Lord's <IT>coming to
Judge that People</IT>, and then <IT>setting</IT> up his <IT>Temple of
the</IT> Christian Church, where <IT>he would be worshipped in spirit
and in truth</IT>; not any longer in Types and Sacrifices, as in <IT>Jerusalem
(John</IT> 4. 20. 21.23.) And the Christian Gospel-Church taken as Ca&rehy;tholique,
and of both Nations, is called <Q REND="it">the houshold of God, built
on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed
together groweth unto an <RO>Holy Temple</RO> in the Lord, in whom they
are also builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</Q>
(Ephes. 2.19,20,21.22.)</P>
<P>And <IT>as by the Temple</IT>, so by <IT>Jerusalem</IT> also is
the <IT>Gospel-Church of Jew and Gentile</IT> signified, and that also,
as the <IT>Church is Militant and Triumphant; Jerusalem which is above
being mother of us all</IT>, (Gal. 4. 25, 26, 27.<ADD>)</ADD></P>
<P>In which it is to be observed that the state of the <IT>Christian
Church</IT> is set forth in the Revelations by 2 <IT>Visions</IT> of 2
<IT>Women</IT>.</P>
<PB N="6">
<P><IT>One</IT> the <IT>Holy Christian</IT> Church, represented <IT>in
a Woman cloathed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her
head a crown of 12 starrs</IT>, she <IT>travailing with Child</IT>
(shewing her <IT>numerous Issue</IT>) who was before <IT>barren (Isa.</IT>
54.I.) she also, and hers <IT>prosecuted and persecuted by the dragon</IT>,
but <IT>preserved</IT> (Rev. 12. 1, 2, 3. 6. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.)
</P>
<P>But the <IT>other woman</IT> signifying the <IT>Church
Antichristian</IT>, persecuting the true Professors, and <IT>drunk with
the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus</IT>
(Rev. 17. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.)</P>
<P>Observe also that these 2 <IT>women</IT> (or the <IT>Church under
these 2 states and conditions</IT>) are also represented by 2 <IT>Cities</IT>,
the great City <IT>Babylon</IT> and <IT>Jerusalem</IT>: that City
named <IT>Babylon</IT> (Rev. 17.5,18.) being for that <IT>Antichristian
state</IT>: but the other City <IT>Jerusalem</IT> (Rev. 20.21, <IT>&</IT>
22.) for the Church of God, the new <IT>Jerusalem and Temple</IT>; no
won&rehy;der then if by <IT>Jerusalem and the Temple</IT> the <IT>Christian
Church</IT> be signi&rehy;fied.</P>
<P>5. And, that <IT>Jerusalem</IT> and the Temple there, could not be
the place where that man of sin or Antichrist was to sit, appears, in
that <IT>Babylon</IT>, the city contrary to <IT>Jerusalem</IT>, is
declared <IT>Antichrist's seat</IT>: Also, that the description given
to that City (the seat of Antichrist) no way suits with <IT>Jerusalem</IT>,
see for that (<IT>Rev.</IT> 17. 6, 7, 8, 18.) where, by <IT>Babylon</IT>,
the Romanists (we need go no further) <IT>intend Rome</IT>, and for
that the <IT>Rhemists</IT> earnestly contend in their Annotations on 1
Pet. 5.13. <Q REND="it">The Church that is at Babylon saluteth you</Q>
(saith St. <IT>Peter</IT>) which is their Scripture-proof <IT>for St.

the name <IT>Babylon</IT> in the Revelation, <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Certissimum

Rome <IT>is built on seven hills, nor was there any other city, which

new Rome</IT>, being also <IT>seated on hills</IT>, yet did not that
then in St. <IT>Johns</IT> dayes <IT>reign over the Kings of the Earth</IT>.
And as to <IT>Jerusalem</IT>, nothing of all that could be said of it,
<IT>neither</IT> that <IT>it was <PB N="7">so situated on seven hills</IT>,
nor <IT>then reigning over the Kings of the earth</IT> Jerusalem <IT>being
then with her children in Bondage</IT> (Gal. 4. 25.) and that to the
<IT>Romans</IT>; and by the <IT>Romans</IT> soon after destroyed.</P>
<P>And if <IT>Rome</IT> be the City for that malignant state, then
must the Temple of God be understood to be there, and <IT>Rome</IT> to
be the place for <IT>Antichrist's sitting</IT>. But it is objected, how
the Church of <IT>Rome</IT> should be then called the Temple of God
where <IT>Antichrist sitteth</IT>.</P>
<P>Res. So was <IT>Jerusalem</IT> also once the Faithful City. And
even when at worst, after their crucifying the Lord, it was then called
<IT>the Holy City (Math.</IT> 27. 53.) having that name from what
before it was. So was <IT>Rome</IT> once famous over the World for its
faith (<IT>Rom</IT>. 1.8.) and the Church there was the Temple of God.
And it was an honour to the Church of <IT>Rome</IT>, that it held out
longer than some other Churches and opposed the Heresies rising and
prevailing in the Eastern Churches; yet as those famous Churches of
<IT>Asia</IT>, fell from their Pu&rehy;rity (particular Churches may
fail) so did <IT>Rome</IT> it self after, and that <IT>once faithful
city became an Harlot</IT> (Rev. 17.5.) as was said of <IT>Je&rehy;rusalem</IT>,
and <IT>their silver was become dross, and their wine mixt with wa&rehy;ter</IT>
(Isa. 1. 21, 22.) <IT>once Pure</IT>, now Mixt and Corrupt with Errors
and they even Apostate from that Faith professed by their Forefathers:
yet from what once was, and from what is yet there left of Good (though
<IT>mixed and corrupt</IT>) that Church is called by the Apostle here
<IT>The Temple of God</IT> and <IT>there Antichrist sitting</IT>.</P>
<P>The summe of all is, that <IT>Babylon</IT>, which is acknowledged
to be <IT>Rome</IT>, and the <IT>Temple of God there</IT>, or the
<IT>Church of</IT> Rome <IT>Apostate from the Faith</IT> formerly
professed, is <IT>the place where Antichrist is to be expected and
found, which</IT> was the 2d <IT>circumstance</IT> here considerable
for <IT>Antichrist's discovery</IT>: his <IT>place: sitting in the
Temple of God</IT>.</P>

<P>The Next is that of <IT>time, when he should appear</IT>.</P>
<P>Little difference is between the Romanists and us, as to the <IT>place</IT>;
but the question is of the <IT>time</IT>, for as the <IT>Jewes</IT>
speak of <IT>Christ yet to come</IT>, so do they of <IT>Rome</IT>
concerning <IT>Antichrist</IT>, and that he <IT>is ex&rehy;pected
about the end of the World and at</IT> Rome, <IT>when</IT> Rome <IT>shall
turn Apostate</IT>, but we Assert <IT>that Antichrist is already come;
and that long <PB N="8">since; and that he is even now in the World
acting as is said of him</IT>: which is to be now examined.</P>
<P>The <IT>time for Antichrist's appearing</IT> is thus in the text
expressed (v. 5, 6, 7, 8.) <Q REND="it">Remember ye not</Q>, saith the
Apostle, <Q REND="it">That when I was yet with you I told you these

<FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Pontifex Maximus</FOREIGN>, thus

was an honorable office among the first 5. Governments</IT>; they were
supream, under which this was, although independent. Nor is it now as it
was after under the 6th <IT>Government</IT>, that of <IT>C&aelig;sars</IT>:
it having been <IT>then annexed to the Imperial Crown</IT>; but <IT>now
in the Ro&rehy;mish Pontificate</IT>, this <IT>that was</IT>, and <IT>after
was not, now is</IT>, being <IT>restored and created supream, where we
find even the very Title of</IT> <FOREIGN LANG="LAT">Pontifex Maxi&rehy;mus</FOREIGN>

exempted from civil power</IT>, and <IT>only accountable to him the now</IT>

he be&rehy;comes <IT>now in that exalted Power an eighth</IT>, the

<P>But to <IT>the introducing this seventh head in the Government of</IT>

<P>This required wary expressions, not thereby to raise persecutions to

the Jews objected to Christ. <IT>John</IT> the 18. 12, 15. and to his
<IT>Apostles. (Acts.</IT> 17.7.25.8.) Therefore we find the Apostle
here very circumspect in declaring himself in it, not speaking all, but
referring to what he had before told them in the ear, <Q REND="it">Remember
ye not what I told you of these things when I was yet with you?</Q> (2.

gradually comeing on according to the steps of the former's receding.</P>
<P>1. For on <IT>Constantines leaving Rome</IT>, and <IT>makeing
Constantinople the seat of his</IT> Empire <IT>thereby</IT> (<FOREIGN

Territories, held in Fee, and in Demeasn for ever. This I pass; it not
being my work at present to examine it. In this state things stood about
300 years, <IT>Romes</IT> Goverment being in that time by its Bishops,
yet subjected to the Emperor, by which they were kept within their
bounds, for <IT>Rome</IT> being but one of the 5 Patriarchs, although

and <IT>that Antichrist himself was not farr off</IT>. And <IT>now was
the Title of Pope appropriated to the Bi&rehy;shop of Rome</IT>, which
was before communicated to other Patriarchs, and Bishops also
indifferently.</P>
<P>And hitherto <IT>reached Romes Episcopal</IT> and <IT>Patriarchal
Government</IT>, of which it was said that it should <IT>continue a
short space, Rev.</IT> 7. 10. which was about 300 years, that being but
short compared with what followed from <IT>Boniface</IT> 3. when the
<IT>Title began to swell to its greatness, they</IT> being thenceforth
<IT>Universal Bishops, and Popes above</IT> all.</P>
<P>3. But after <IT>Boniface</IT> 3. <IT>Pope Leo.</IT> 3.
<FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">an</FOREIGN>, 800. made a farther <IT>Essay

for the Church, to Expell the Barbarians who had in&rehy;vaded <IT>Italy</IT>,
out of whose hands <IT>Rome</IT> was recovered, and restored to the
Pope, with addition of other large Territories.</P>
<P>4. But all this while, the Popes power, was in some things restrain&rehy;ed
by those Emperours of their own making, who <IT>reserved to them&rehy;selves
the choosing</IT> and <IT>placeing of Bishops</IT>, and the approbation
even of the very <IT>Popes</IT> also.</P>
<P>In this, <IT>Gregory</IT> 7th. contended with <IT>Henry</IT> the

him his subject <IT>Rodulphus</IT>, naming him Emperour, and giving the
Crown, with <Q LANG="LAT">PETRA DEDIT PETRO, PETRUS DIADEMA RODULPHO.</Q></P>
<P>Of the troubles, bloud, and destruction to <IT>Germany</IT> in

writers that glory given, that he was <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">Imperii
Pontificii fundator</FOREIGN>; others his Predecessors attempted the
reaching at the temporal power, but was not till now attained.</P>
<P>And after, the Emperour <IT>Henry</IT> 5th. coming to <IT>Rome</IT>
to be Crow&rehy;ned by Pope <IT>Paschalis</IT> 2d. the Pope would not
consent to his Coro&rehy;nation, he <IT>first did give over all Right
of Election</IT> of Popes, and of <IT>Investitures of Bishops by Staffe
and Ring</IT>; In which although that Pope failed then of his end, yet
was that after attained.</P>
<P>5. And although, In all this the Pope had gained the point of <IT>tem&rehy;poral
sovereignty</IT>, and the gaining also out of <IT>temporal hands</IT>
into the <IT>Popes power</IT>, the <IT>Investitures of Bishops</IT>,
by which he was in that kind absolute, yet could not that satisfie,
while the Pope was over-topped by a <IT>General Council</IT>, By which
he had been oft threatned, awed and some&rehy;times deposed.</P>
<P>The removing this therefore, was to be next attempted, and was at
length also by Pope <IT>Leo</IT> 10th. compassed, so far as the Popes
Coun&rehy;cil at <IT>Lateran</IT> could do towards it; of which <IT>Bellarmine</IT>

Councils, and reproveth a contrary de&rehy;cree in the Council of</IT>

<IT>confirming those Romish erroneus positions</IT> which had been long

<P>But before this be shut up, one doubt is to be removed, <IT>of the
Empire being not yet taken out of the way</IT>, which we now see in Be&rehy;ing.</P>
<P>Res. 1. Of that Empire which was in the Apostles dayes, is that by
the Apostle intended, that it should be first taken out of the way, the
standing of that being an hinderance to the Succeeding Government. But
that Empire was long since extinguished.</P>
<PB N="15">
<P>2. The present Empire is of another kind, being of the Popes own
erection, for restoring, promoting and preserving his greatness; His
hand being in that <CORR SIC="thoughout">throughout</CORR>.
</P>
<P>So <IT>Bellarmine</IT> writing of <IT>the Translation of the Roman
Empire</IT> in 3 bookes, he makes the summe of <IT>his first book</IT>,
The <IT>Roman Empire be&rehy;ing by authority of the</IT> Pope, <IT>translated
from the</IT> Gr&aelig;cians <IT>to the</IT> French. And the summe of
his 2d. book, <IT>The Roman Empire passing from the family of</IT>
Charles <IT>the</IT> Great, <IT>and the</IT> French, <IT>unto the
family of</IT> Otho, <IT>and the</IT> Saxons, <IT>by Authority of the
Bishop of Rome</IT>. The Title also of his 3d. book is, The 7 <IT>Electors
of the Empire to have been instituted by Pope</IT> Gregory 5th. See the
Popes hand in all; he also even now approv&rehy;ing and Crowning the
Emperour elected.</P>
<P>And therein we find that fulfilled which was prophesied of <IT>this
Se&rehy;cond Beast</IT> (the Papacy) <IT>Its setting up an Image of the
former beast which had a wound by a Sword, that it should live, speak
and be worshipped</IT> (Rev. 13. 12, 14, 15.) For <IT>that first beast</IT>
(the Emperour) having in <IT>Augustu&rehy;lus</IT>, the last Emperour
of that race, received <IT>that its deadly wound</IT>; It, was by the
2d. <IT>beast</IT> that succeeded (the <IT>Pope</IT>) again restored,
and an <IT>I&rehy;mage of the former, made by him an Empire</IT>, set
up; to which he <IT>gave life</IT>, so as to speak, and be worshipped,
that is, honoured and followed.</P>
<P>But 3dly. observe, that this is <IT>but an Image</IT>: so is the
now <IT>Roman</IT> Em&rehy;peror, compared with what was.</P>
<P><IT>The now Roman Emperor is but an Image of the Ancient Empire</IT>,
(saith Salmeron) <IT>and the Majestie of the People of Rome, by which
the World was of Old Governed, is now taken away from the Earth, and the
Emperour is now but an empty</IT> Title, <IT>and is but a shadow</IT>

<P>This (say some) shews <IT>Antichrist to be a Conjurer and Compactor
<PB N="20">with the devil, and such</IT> (saith they) <IT>was Simon

<IT>Popes also</IT>, as (to mention no more) <IT>Sylvester</IT>. 2.
<IT>Benedictor</IT> 9th. <IT>Gregory</IT>. 7. which I pass at present.</P>
<P>Neither insist I on those <IT>wonders</IT> by these acted, whether
<IT>seeming real by Satans working</IT> with them or for them; or that
they be <IT>lying wonders</IT>, whether <IT>feigned</IT>, or imposed
as true; or <IT>lying, serving for confirming lyes</IT> and untrue
doctrines of men; nor speak I of those <IT>ridiculous fables, with
which their Legends of Saints are stuffed</IT>, such as may be wondred
how learned and prudent men should give credit to them (if they do.) And
if they do; it must be surely from <IT>Gods giving them over</IT>,
Judicially <IT>to believe a lye; they not receiving the love of the
truth</IT> (so is the Text:) <Q REND="it">The seat of the beast on
which the An&rehy;gel poured out his vial, and his Kingdom is full of
darkness</Q> (<IT>Rev.</IT> 16.10.)</P>
<P>But I look on this here rather <IT>as a sign, and mark of
Antichrist</IT> by which he should act, and be known in the World, his
<IT>Antichristian Church boasting of wonders, making miracles a sign of
the true Church, and upbraiding us</IT> with <IT>our want</IT> (they
say) of <IT>Miracles</IT>.</P>
<P>To which we say. 1, That <IT>for the first introducing of truth,
miracles might be necessary</IT>, but that truth being once received,
such miracles were after unnecessary; such were in the <IT>first
planting of the Gospel, done by Christ and his Apostles, which we
challenge as ours</IT>. But that <IT>truth then delivered to the saints</IT>
being received and believed, what now need we more, or any renewed
miracles? For, <IT>miracles and wonders</IT>, as tongues, &amp;c. <IT>are
for unbelievers, not for them that believe</IT>, (1 <IT>Cor.</IT>
14.22. and it shews a <IT>novelty in those Popish Doctrines</IT>, that
need fresh confirma&rehy;tions, and shewes them <IT>unbelievers</IT>
that seek such. But in this is a pro&rehy;per <IT>mark of that
Antichristian Church, that and no other sort of professors or People in
the world, but</IT> Rome <IT>only and the</IT> Pope, <IT>adhereing so
to miracles</IT>.</P>
<P>V. But to proceed, <IT>Another mark of this man of Sin</IT>, by
which he is known, is, that he <IT>opposeth himself; that is</IT>, to
Christ; therefore cal&rehy;led <IT>Antichrist</IT>.</P>
<P><IT>Obj.</IT> But how, can that be said of the <IT>Pope</IT>; he
being for <IT>Christ</IT>, and his Vicar: <IT>for him</IT>, and <IT>not
against him</IT>?</P>
<P><IT>Resp</IT>: But the word <IT>Antichrist</IT> may signifie both
<IT>pro</IT> and <IT>con, for and against</IT>; and both here
applicable.</P>
<PB N="21">
<P>1. For <IT>Christ</IT>; <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">anti</FOREIGN>
sometimes signifies <IT>for</IT>, or in <IT>the place and room</IT> of
another; so <IT>Archelaus reigned</IT> <FOREIGN LANG="GKGK">anti</FOREIGN>
in <IT>the room of his father Herod (Mat.</IT> 2.22.) So <IT>pretends
the Pope</IT> to be <IT>for Christ</IT>, in his place and stead, his
Vicar on earth.
</P>
<P>This is agreable to what we read of <IT>Antichrist, what kind of
adver&rehy;sary he is</IT>: not such as is the <IT>Turk, an open and
declared enemie to Christ and Christians</IT>; but such <IT>an one as
sits in the Temple of God</IT>; profess&rehy;ing to be <IT>for Christ</IT>,
yet to him an <IT>underhand enemy</IT>; so saith <IT>Anselm: they seem
or pretend themselves servants of Christ, and of his Family, when in
truth they are the Ministers of Antichrist (in 2 Thess.</IT> 2. 2. they
there&rehy;fore who contend earnestly <IT>for the Turks</IT> being
<IT>Antichrist</IT>, must be greatly mistaken.</P>
<P>2. And yet while this Antichrist pretends himself <IT>Thus for
Christ, and for being his Vicar, see him even then opposing, he that
opposeth, is his description 2 Thess. 2. 4. under the name of Christ
acting for Anti&rehy;christ</IT>, as was said of <IT>Gregory</IT>, 7.
<IT>who was pointed at as Antichrist</IT>. As hath been shewed out of
<IT>Aventinus</IT>.</P>
<P>And to shew the Pope to be this Antichrist <IT>opposing Christ and
con&rehy;trary to him, see him contradicting</IT> and <IT>countermanding
Christ's Will and Commands</IT>: I instance only at present in <IT>those
Christ's two ordinances, his Word</IT> and <IT>Sacraments</IT>.</P>
<P>1. <IT>His word. We are by Christ our Lord commanded to search the
Scrip&rehy;tures, for in them we have eternal Life (John 5. 39.) unto
which ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light shining in a dark
place</IT>; saith S. Peter. (2. <IT>Pet.</IT> 1.19) and <IT>we find
Timothy commended</IT> by St. <IT>Paul</IT>, that <IT>from a child he
had known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make wise to salvation,
they being profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor&rehy;rection,
for instruction, in righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect,
throughly furnished unto all good works</IT> (2. <IT>Tim.</IT>
3.15,16,17.)</P>
<P>Hear now the Pope in this; <IT>search the Scripture</IT> (saith
<IT>Christ) do not search them, saith the Pope</IT>; It is <IT>well
done that you do it, saith</IT> St. Pet. It is <IT>not well done saith
the Pope</IT>; They <IT>are profitable, saith</IT> St. Paul, <IT>they
are dangerous saith the Pope. They are a light shining in a dark place</IT>,
saith St. <IT>Pet. they are dark saith the Pope</IT>. St. Paul <IT>commends</IT>
Timothy <IT>for being from a child acquainted with the Scriptures, they
are not for Children, saith the</IT> Pope, And much more of that kind;
see him in <PB N="22">this <IT>Antichrist opposing Christ his Word and
Commands, contradicting and countermanding, And whom in this we should
obey, God or man, Judge ye</IT>. Acts 4.19.</P>
<P>2. As to the <IT>Sacrament</IT> of the Lords Supper, our Lord gave
the bread broken, a sign of his body broken, and after that the <IT>cup</IT>;
the <IT>wine poured out</IT> being his bloud in his death shed for us,
<IT>commanding so to do till his coming again</IT>: and as to the <IT>Cup</IT>
particularly (foreseeing what would be after by opposers to the
contrary) our Lord added in that ministration, <Q REND="it">Drink ye
all of this</Q> (Math. 26.27.) it being said, that accordingly, <IT>they
did all drink of it</IT>, (Mark 14.23.) which, <IT>all to drink</IT>;
and <IT>all drinking</IT>, is in the <IT>wine expressed</IT>; and
implyed onely in the <IT>bread</IT>. Which Institution and command of
Christ our Lord in that, being his <IT>will and testament</IT> left to
his Church, is to <IT>be as his last will, observed</IT> to the last,
and ought not to be changed in the least, no, <IT>although it had been
but mans Testament</IT> onely (Gal. 3.5.) yet <IT>see Christ in that by
Antichrist opposed, Take the Bread</IT>, and <IT>also the Cup</IT>
(saith Christ) <IT>not so</IT> saith the Pope, <IT>the Cup may be
spared</IT>; for Christs <IT>bloud is in his Body by concomitancy</IT>;
and taking his Body, ye have by con&rehy;sequence his Bloud: But here it
is understood that <IT>his Body is given broken</IT>, and his <IT>Bloud
shed</IT>, both setting forth the <IT>Lords death</IT>, and not
otherwise; which <IT>countermand</IT> to Christs <IT>command</IT> in
that, is with a <IT><FOREIGN LANG="LAT">non obstante; licet</FOREIGN>
&horfill;. Although that Christ and the primitive Church did administer
the Sacrament in both Kinds; notwithstanding, is this custom of but one
Kind to be held for a law unreproveable</IT>. (so is it ordered in the
Council of <IT>Constance</IT>. Sess. 13.) And the <IT>Council of</IT>
Trent <IT>after; This Synod being taught by the Holy Ghost; and the
custom and Judg&rehy;ment of his Church doth declare and teach that the
Laiety and Clergie not celebrating, are not obliged to take the
Sacrament of the</IT> Eucharist <IT>under both Kinds, notwithstanding
that Christ did institute this Sacrament under both Kinds, and so gave
it to his Apostles</IT> (Concil. Trident sess. 21. c. 1.)</P>
<P>And <IT>is not the Pope in this an Antichrist? to Christ an
opposer? he that opposeth</IT>? Text v. 4.</P>
<P>VI. Rightly therefore is <IT>this that man of Sin</IT>, that <IT>wicked</IT>
here in&rehy;tended, which is his next mark here: and how <IT>agreeing</IT>

<PB N="24">
<P>Such is that <IT>Antichristian cruelty</IT>; and that yet worse, in
its being grounded on their very <IT>Doctrine, Religion, and Faith</IT>;

</P>
<P>Which <IT>Bloud-thirsty cruelty against the Worshippers of Christ</IT>,
sticks as <IT>a distinguishing mark of this Romish and Babylonian
Antichrist, in being drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and Martyrs of
Jesus</IT>. Which is pe&rehy;culiar to those alone, not to be found in
any other party of the Chri&rehy;stian World beside. In that is this
<IT>a man of sin</IT> above others, and <IT>wicked exceedingly</IT>.</P>
<P>3. Add that <IT>the being a man of sin</IT>, is as it were fixed to

any thing in that kind, but directed rather to the ways of his
Predecessors, with Fire and Sword to prosecute those, who object&rehy;ed
those Errours to the Court. His Oration to the Pope to that pur&rehy;pose
is extant.</P>
<P>On which, <IT>Pope Adrian</IT> discoursing after, privately, with
<IT>William Excourt</IT>, whom he after created Cardinal; and <IT>Theodorick

<P>The summe of all is,</P>
<LIST><ITEM><LABEL>I.</LABEL> That what that <IT>great</IT> City
<IT>Babylon</IT> of the <IT>Chaldeans</IT> was, as to <IT>oppression</IT>
and <IT>cruelty</IT>, to Gods people of old (<IT>Jer</IT>. 51.34,35.)
That should be to the Christian Church, another <IT>great City</IT>
called also <IT>in a Mystery</IT> Babylon <IT>the mother of the
Abominations of the Earth, drunk with the Bloud of the Saints and
Martyrs of Jesus</IT>. (Rev. 17.5,6.)</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>II.</LABEL> That <IT>this great</IT> City Babylon,
described <IT>a woman sitting on 7 moun&rehy;tains, and reigning over
the Kings of the Earth</IT> (Rev. 17.9,18.) is ac&rehy;knowledged to be
<IT>Rome</IT>. They therefore who send us to <IT>Jerusalem</IT>, or
<IT>Constantinople</IT> for the <IT>place</IT>, put us out of the way
in that enquiry.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>III.</LABEL> That in <IT>Rome</IT>, should sit one,

of the earth should be seduced</IT>, and <IT>drawn into dam&rehy;nable
Heresies</IT>: and that he the authour of those miseries and mischiefs
to the Church, should be <IT>a man of sin</IT> commonly called <IT>Antichrist</IT>.
This the <IT>Romanists</IT> themselves acknowledge.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>IV.</LABEL> That in so doing, this <IT>Antichrist</IT>
should <IT>sit in the Temple of God</IT>, as being <IT>of the Church</IT>,
and <IT>over the Church in chief, pretending for Christ</IT>, he the
while <IT>acting against Christ</IT>. A seeming friend, but secret
enemy; a secret, not an open, declared and professed enemy to Christ and
his followers. Therefore cannot this be the <IT>Turk</IT>, or any such.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>V.</LABEL> That this Antichrist, <IT>sitting in the
Temple of God</IT>, should be in the capacity of a <IT>seventh head of
the Government of</IT> Rome, <IT>next succeeding</IT> <PB N="26">the
sixth head or Government there, (<IT>that of</IT> C&aelig;sars) This
brings it home to the <IT>Papacy</IT>, That and none other <IT>being
the 7th.</IT> and that also long since on the Emperours removal setled.
Vain therefore are alle&rehy;gations for any others being this
Antichrist, not being of <IT>Rome</IT>, nor there so qualified.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>VI.</LABEL> That the Pope sitteth in the <IT>Temple of
God, as God, shewing himself there as God, and exalted above all that is
called God, and wor&rehy;shipped</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>VII.</LABEL> Here is to be added what is (in <IT>Rev.</IT>
17.3,4.) said of <IT>that wo&rehy;man, that great City</IT>, and <IT>Babylon</IT>:
That she did sit on a <IT>scarlet colour&rehy;ed</IT> Beast: and <IT>that
she (the woman) was</IT> arrayed in purple and scarlet co&rehy;lour, and

the <IT>proper attire both of Popes and Cardinals</IT>.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>VIII.</LABEL> Nor is to be omitted, what is (<IT>Rev.</IT>
17.5.) said in a way of further description of that <IT>woman</IT>;
that <IT>upon her forehead was a</IT> name <IT>written</IT>, Mystery,
<IT>Babylon</IT> the great, the mother of harlots, and Abo&rehy;minations
of the Earth. Concerning which is <IT>observed</IT>, that as the <IT>High
Priest</IT> under the Law, had in the Front <IT>his Miter engraven</IT>,
HOLI&rehy;NESS TO THE LORD (<IT>Exod</IT>. 29.36,37.) So the
<FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">summus Ponti&rehy;fex</FOREIGN>, the
<IT>Pope</IT>, had also in his <IT>Tiara</IT>, that name, <IT>Mystery</IT>.
Which having been observed and objected by King <IT>James</IT> of
blessed memory, in that his Excellent Work on the <IT>Revelation,
Lessius</IT>, his Antagonist, denies it not, but labours to put it off
slidingly: nor could it be de&rehy;nied, there being many <IT>Eye-witnesses</IT>
to averre it <IT>Down. de Antichr. l.</IT> I. c. 7. which his <IT>name</IT>
of <IT>mystery</IT>, well agrees with that <IT>mystery of ini&rehy;quity</IT>,
by which his evil and secret workings are described, (2 <IT>Thess.</IT>
2.7.) one (not unlikely) referring to the other. But from God it is
(sure&rehy;ly) <IT>providentially</IT>, that that word <IT>mystery</IT>
should so be seen <IT>in the whores forehead, shewing who she is</IT>;
notwithstanding that they who contrived it, might have had other ends in
it; as that the <IT>Popes Triple Crown</IT>, pointed to that <IT>mystery</IT>
of his <IT>Triple power and dominion</IT> in <IT>Heaven</IT>, and in
<IT>Earth</IT>, and in <IT>Purgatory</IT>.</ITEM></LIST>
<P>So as in the <IT>Papacy</IT> concur all these <IT>Scripture-marks
of Antichrist</IT>, And although some may be applicable otherwise, yet
are the princi&rehy;pal proper to the Pope alone; and taken altogether,
not meeting in any other but in the <IT>Pope</IT> only. Therefore on
the whole, who would <PB N="27">not conclude <IT>the Popes being
Antichrist; the man of sin; and son of Perdition</IT>.</P>

follows on the other ne&rehy;cessarily; for if he <IT>be a man of sin</IT>,
he must <IT>be a son of perdition</IT>.</P>
<P>Of this his fall it is here said, <IT>that the Lord shall consume
him with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy him with the

</P>
<P>1. That <IT>he consumed by the breath of the Lords mouth</IT>; The
<IT>breath of the Lords mouth</IT> is the <IT>preaching of the Gospel</IT>
which is <IT>the word of God</IT> so Generally interpreted; And to be
<IT>consumed</IT> implyes a <IT>lingring wear&rehy;ing away</IT>, and
by degrees wasting, and decaying; not a violent and suddain destruction,
such as was <IT>Simon-Magus his down-fall</IT>, said to have been <IT>on
St. Peters breath</IT> or prayers against him.</P>
<P>Of this Consumption <IT>of the Papal</IT> power and greatness by
the <IT>preaching of the word and Gospel in the world</IT>, we have
apparent evi&rehy;dence. I shall give it as by <IT>Bellarmine</IT>
expressed, he by that <IT>waining in the Papacy</IT>, arguing, <IT>against
the Popes being Antichrist</IT>, Antichrists great&rehy;ness and
prevailings in the World, being much spoken of, whereas his <IT>fall</IT>
and <IT>declining state</IT>, is also described as <CORR SIC="si">is</CORR>
his greatness. <IT>Bellar&rehy;mines</IT> words are these:</P>
<P><Q REND="it">Since that time when ye <RO>(Protestants)</RO> say
the Pope began to be Anti&rehy;christ, the Papal Empire was so far from
increasing, that thenceforth it every day more and more declined, And
(as you would have it) Antichrist reigning, the Roman See hath by little
and little decayed, it having lost al&rehy;most all Africa, a great part
of Asia; all Greece and even in our very days a great part of Germany,
Sweden, Gothland, Norwey, and all Denmark, A good part of England,
France, Helvetia, Poland, Bohemia, and part of Hungary are fallen away.</Q>

This way by <IT>Bellarmine</IT> written <FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">an</FOREIGN>.
1577, as appears in the Preface to <PB N="28">that work, so as that
decay in the Papal Empire was then within the space of 60 <IT>years</IT>,

<P>Thus of <IT>Babylon, Rome</IT>, and <IT>Antichrist's fall, as to
it self considered</IT>.</P>
<P>II. See that also as to their <IT>Adherents</IT>, in which our
charitable <PB N="29">thoughts of them have been by wrong measures
mistaken to some dis&rehy;advantage: that which we say in that, is:</P>
<P>1. That there was a time when Antichristianism was a <IT>mystery</IT>,
not understood, Antichrist not being yet so declared as after.</P>
<P>2. And that after Antichrist was pointed at in the Church of <IT>Rome</IT>,
yet while erroneous doctrines there were but disputable, not imposed, as
after in the Council of <IT>Trent</IT>, to be
<FOREIGN REND="it" LANG="LAT">de fide</FOREIGN>, with an <IT>Ana&rehy;thema</IT>
to such as thought of them otherwise, and to such as did not understand
the reach and depth of those evils; and where the light of the Gospel is
shut out, as in some places, and the knowledge of that denied, and
persecuted. For these, <IT>is our charity grounded</IT>, to say well of
them, as of those of <IT>Thyatira</IT>, who had not known the depths of
<IT>Sa&rehy;tan, as they speak (Rev.</IT> 2.24.) and those of <IT>Pergamus,
dwelling even where Satan's seat is</IT>; yet (saith our Lord) <IT>thou
hast held fast my name, and hast not denied my Faith, even in those
dayes wherein</IT> Antipas <IT>my faithful Martyr was slain among them
where Satan dwelleth</IT> (v. 12.) To be among <IT>Hereticks, and not
to believe Hereticks</IT>, or not being led by them, is St. <IT>Augustine's</IT>
distinction in that case; such ignorance may excuse.</P>
<P>But as to ignorance affected, having Light, and means of know&rehy;ledge,
and when called on to come out of <IT>Babylon</IT>, its ruine being de&rehy;clared,
and communion there declared perillous; To such we say, that their
continuing so in that state, is hazardous and full of danger: Nor can
such rely on ignorance, it not in that case excusing. For in <IT>this
is condemnation, where light is come; and men love darkness rather than
light (John</IT> 3.19.) and where the <IT>leaders of the People cause
to err, they that are led of them are destroyed (Is.</IT> 9.16.) and
<IT>the blind by them so led; both fall into the Ditch. (Math.</IT>
15.14.)</P>
<P>4. But as to those <IT>who are knowing</IT> and who <IT>defend and
plead for Baal, seducing, and being seduced</IT>, and <IT>so continuing</IT>,
the state of such is declared <IT>damnable; that they all may be
damned, saith the</IT> Text who <IT>believe not the truth but have
pleasure in unrighteousness</IT> (v. 12.) and to such belongs that evil
by the Angel declared, <IT>if any man worship the beast and his image,
and receive his Mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which is pou&rehy;red out without
mixture into the Cup of his indignation, and he shall be <PB N="30">tormented</IT>
&amp;c. <IT>Rev.</IT> 14.9,11. let such consider their State seriously
and seasonably.</P>
<P>And now to conclude with a word <IT>to our selves</IT>, that as
<IT>we are to bless God for calling us out of that Sate of evil</IT>,
so to be <IT>confirmed in the truth</IT>, and not to <IT>fall back</IT>,
whatever <IT>the Temptation be, good, or evil, saving life, or loosing
it</IT>; and that we desire <IT>the Lords grace in that for help and
support</IT>.</P>
<P>All which I shall shut up in the words of the Apostle, next after my
Text (v. 13,14,15,16,17.) <Q REND="it">We are bound to give thanks
alway to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath
from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of

by our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have
been taught, whether by word or by our Epistle: Now our Lord Jesus

everlasting consolation, and good hope through Grace, comfort your
