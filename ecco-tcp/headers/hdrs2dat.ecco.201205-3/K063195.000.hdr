Hazen suggests that this is the second edition; the half-title reads: 'Designs, &amp;c.'; there is an exclamation mark in the rows of printer's flowers on the third and fourth pages of the 'Explanation of the prints'; the compositor ran out of the letter "d" and used an inverted "p" for the last seven occurences on p.26.</NOTE><NOTE>Reproduction of original from the Harvard University Houghton Library.</NOTE><NOTE>Hazen, 42</NOTE><NOTE>English Short Title Catalog, ESTCT75219.</NOTE><NOTE>Electronic data.
