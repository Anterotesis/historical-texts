<HEAD>REASONS again&s;t the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</HEAD>
<P>_TO give an Account of the Small-Pox, or to run through the diffe|rent Sorts and Stages of it, would be too tedious at pre&s;ent; and which having been already done by Men of Eminency in the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick, it would be Pre&s;umption
<PB N="8" REF="7">and Trifling in me, to offend by a le&s;s perfect Account of my own.</P>
<P>THIS Epidemical contagious Di&s;ea&s;e, contracted from the In|&s;piration of Air heterogene to our Bodies, betrays it&s;elf by Pains of the Back and Head, Weari|ne&s;s in the Limbs, Vomitings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u&s;ually two or three Days before the Eruption of the Pu&s;|tules; after which, for the mo&s;t part, the Patient feels a Remi&s;|&s;ion of Symptoms: and the kind Maturation of the Pu&s;tules generally frees the infected Per|&s;on in twelve or fourteen Days, unle&s;s &s;omething unexpected &s;uc|ceeds. In this Di&s;temper, Nature labours with all her Force, to clear the Blood of the Poi&s;on, till by degrees &s;he drives it from the Center to the Surface, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">effects an univer&s;al Depuration: but how far this laudable Work will be carried on by the new Method of Ingrafting or Inocu|lating, &s;hall be our next Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>IN order to which, we will pre&s;ume the Infection of the or|dinary way to be with the Air fir&s;t admitted into the Lungs, whence, by the common Circle of the Blood, by degrees it per|vades the whole Body; which Pollution being thus gradually introduced, occa&s;ions not &s;uch mighty Revels in the Blood, as to take off one in twenty, unle&s;s a more Malignant Sort than u&s;ual (God be prai&s;ed) rages in our Clime; and then I fear the In|oculation of &s;uch a one would prove as dangerous to us as the wor&s;t of the accidental. And
<PB N="10" REF="9">unle&s;s the pre&s;ent Method was wholly void of any fatal Symp|toms, and the Patient entirely &s;ecure in the Experiment, (
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Lord <HI>Sandecland</HI>'s Son, who dy'd of this ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Method.</NOTE> of which we have had a late melan|cholly In&s;tance to the contrary) it would be the highe&s;t Piece of Ra&s;hne&s;s and Cruelty to give up our Children Sacrifices to the fond Delu&s;ion of averting an Ill that may be, by the Anticipation of it at pre&s;ent, when the Pro|&s;pect of a good Event in this, is as uncertain as it may prove to them in any Period of Life from the other; nay, perhaps the long|e&s;t may be &s;pun without the Tryal of it at all.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tilling of Poi&s;on into a Wound has always been ac|counted
<PB N="11" REF="10">the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of any; for though the Blood thus fermented may betray it&s;elf in the &s;hape of the Small-Pox, yet it has always a Re&s;ort to a poi|&s;onous Fountain, from which it every Moment receives new Sup|plies: and as by degrees the ve|nomous Particles in the Wound begin to abate of their Fury, the Symptoms become more lan|guid, which though incapable to excite the highe&s;t Di&s;orders, yet in their Return may create Ob|&s;tructions in the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els of the Groins, Arm-pits, Joints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Con&s;equences of which are frequently greater than the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, and &s;ometimes in|curable.</P>
<P>WHICH brings to my Memo|ry an Experiment of a Pretender to Phy&s;ick, who&s;e Ability con&s;i&s;|ted
<PB N="12" REF="11">in a Secret to fortify the Sto|mach again&s;t the Attacks of the mo&s;t malignant Poi&s;on: The Curio&s;ity of the Populace &s;oon eas'd him of his Packets, in which was found this plain Di|rection, <HI>Take this, you'll want no other;</HI> and indeed he &s;poke Truth: for the Patient who&s;e Stupidity led him to the Tryal, narrowly e&s;caped with Life; of which, if he makes a Repetition, he ju&s;tly de&s;erves to lo&s;e it. However, the Quack got what he wanted, and the Peoples Safe|ty was the lea&s;t of his Con|cern.</P>
<P>IT is very ob&s;ervable in Pha|gedenical Ulcers, when at any time they appear dryer than ordinary, that the lea&s;t Portion of Matter lick'd up by the Ve&s;|&s;els, excites Fevers, Frenzies, and
<PB N="13" REF="12">other direful Symptoms; and if Nature is not compen&s;ated by &s;ome critical Swelling, or other Evacuation, the Patient dies: in whom oftentimes the Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, are &s;o affected, as to become mon&s;trou&s;ly big and knotty. How then can we determine for the Infu&s;ion of this Poi&s;on, that it &s;hall not pro|duce the like Effects? There is a wide Difference between extra|va&s;ated Matter in a State of Di|ge&s;tion, and the Poi&s;on of the Blood not yet thrown out: the former, as the Yea&s;t or Flowers of fermented Liquors, will in the &s;malle&s;t Proportion &s;ubdue large Quantities; when the other whil&s;t it maintains its common Cour&s;e with the Blood, receives con&s;tant Checks from the repeat|ed Additions of that Liquor, and the &s;everal Ways of Evacuation;
<PB N="14" REF="13">as is evident from &s;ome In&s;tances of the Small-Pox, where the Skin is &s;o &s;paringly be&s;et with Pim|ples, as not to exceed five or &s;ix in number, and yet the Pa|tient as &s;ecure from a &s;econd Infection as tho&s;e who have &s;uf|fered from a Redundancy of them. Yet even in the&s;e, when there &s;hall happen a Recall of that Matter, though incon&s;ide|rable in Quantity, the wor&s;t of Symptoms ari&s;e, and Death often|times follows.</P>
<P>THE Degrees of Activity in the Poi&s;on of this Di&s;temper, will vary much, according to the Degrees of Exaltation it may receive from the different Jui|ces of different Con&s;titutions, the Stimulus of which will in &s;ome be more pointed, and in others le&s;s; and the Injuries &s;uc|ceeding,
<PB N="15" REF="14">of cour&s;e will be ade|quate to the Nature of the&s;e Spi|cula or Darts, &s;o inimical to the Cra&s;is of our Blood.</P>
<P>WE find in the Poi&s;on of the Viper, when thoroughly pro|voked to an Emi&s;&s;ion of it, the Salts of that Liquor to be &s;o obdurate and inflexible, that un|le&s;s &s;ome of the Fat of that Ani|mal be in&s;tantly in&s;till'd into the Wound made by his Teeth, no Remedy proves equal to the Cure; and if perchance the Pa|tient &s;urvives the Accident, I dare be bold to &s;ay, a &s;econd Attack would prove as fatal as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be reply'd, That it is peculiar to the Small-Pox to affect us but once; in|deed Experience happily de|clares
<PB N="16" REF="15">this Truth; for were we &s;ubject to the Repetition of it, Life would prove a Burden: and we might well with St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Of all, we are the mo&s;t Wretched.</HI> But how far this new Exhibition of it will agree with the accidental Infection, &s;hall be our next Task.</P>
<P>THE rendring a Wound in any part of the Body, and in|flaming the &s;ame with a poi|&s;onous Juice, till by the Irrita|tion of it, each Fibril becomes &s;o fretted, as to produce an Ul|cer, is a dangerous Experiment; for that, what&s;oever Blood is &s;ent to that Part, will be changed into the Nature of the Leaven in the Sore, which may furni&s;h it with greater Supplies than the Con&s;titution can bear, the Ran|cour of which increa&s;ing every
<PB N="17" REF="16">Moment in proportion to the Ferment made there, the Symp|toms will ha&s;ten according to the Addition receiv'd, that if a kind Maturation en&s;ues not in a &s;ta|ted time, the Part thus wounded may be in danger of a Gan|grene, and the Malignancy of the Sore &s;o complicated, as to communicate the Corruption of the one, and the Infection of the other, at the &s;ame time. From whence I need not prog|no&s;ticate the Event, which would but too evidently infer Death, or at lea&s;t the Lo&s;s of that Mem|ber.</P>
<P>WHEN in the natural Way the Matter is gradually thrown out, and is contained under the Skin, where it forms to it&s;elf di&s;tinct Eminencies or Pu&s;tules, receiving their common Cap&s;ule
<PB N="18" REF="17">from the Cutis, or true Skin; which pu&s;hing forwards, the more watery or thin Sub&s;tance tran|&s;pires, and rai&s;es the Cuticula in|to the like Protuberances, that you may plainly di&s;cern a Pock contained in a Pock; that in the Cutis holding the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sub|&s;tance, and mo&s;t fitted for Di|ge&s;tion, according to the In|crea&s;e of which, is the Bulk of the other. Which Contrivance is admirable; for that the Cold|ne&s;s of the Air frequently damps the more &s;uperficial Appearances, which &s;ink and flatten, when by the U&s;e of warm Internals, the inward ones revive, and both are renew'd afre&s;h; at la&s;t the thin|ner Part is per&s;pired, and the thicker left to incru&s;tate and &s;hell off, without any Fears of fre&s;h Supplies of Infection. Na|ture having by this kind Suppu|ration
<PB N="19" REF="18">fini&s;hed her Work, when in the inoculated Way, the Sore &s;hall continue for Weeks after the Pox, and not without Diffi|culty heal at la&s;t. And though the Blood be di&s;pirited and bro|ken from its late Conflict, as not ea&s;ily to admit a &s;econd, or to occa&s;ion the &s;ame Velocity or Heat, yet &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions may be made on it, as to di&s;po&s;e it for Swellings on the Joints, Shoulders, Groins, and other Parts; Con&s;equences confe&s;&s;ed by Dr. <HI>Nettleton,</HI> in his Book to Dr. <HI>Whittaker,</HI> to have happen'd.</P>
<P>IT is certain that Poi&s;on lick'd up by the Ve&s;&s;els from a Wound, will ever produce Effects an|&s;werable to its Nature; and tho&s;e Pu&s;tules thrown out by this new Method, are but &s;o many Efforts indu&s;triou&s;ly made to expel the
<PB N="20" REF="19">Enemy; which Method, as of|ten as renew'd, will cau&s;e the &s;ame Symptoms either to tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by the natural or artificial Pox, as has been ex|perienced on a Patient at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Ho&s;pital; who though he had had them, yet labour'd with the u&s;ual Symptoms of their new Method. Nor can Rea&s;on ju&s;ti|fy the contrary; for the Condi|tion of this Matter, thus infu&s;ed, will always be the &s;ame; that unle&s;s we could &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome &s;ingular Vertue to remain in the Blood as a proper Antagoni&s;t, it would be ab&s;urd to think them &s;ecure from a &s;econd In|&s;ection, any more than that the Trans&s;u&s;ion of the Blood or Matter of a venereal pocky Per|&s;on into a &s;ound Habit, &s;hould &s;ecure him from any future A|mour with Impunity. What
<PB N="21" REF="20">though the Symptoms may ape tho&s;e of the Small-Pox, and the Protuberances of the Skin bear a near Re&s;emblance, yet the Way of Communication differs much. Here the Blood is &s;ated with a gro&s;s tenacious Matter, impregnated with the mo&s;t en|venom'd Salts, which will nece&s;|&s;arily create Ob&s;tructions in the Capillary Ve&s;&s;els; from whence tho&s;e Pains in the Head: And as the Circulation becomes le&s;s free, the Ve&s;&s;els will be more turgid, till by degrees the Pre&s;|&s;ure affects the Nerves, and the Pains of the Back en&s;ue; which are Symptoms not uncommon to other Di&s;tempers, and can be no certain Proof of this.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the&s;e inoculated Pu&s;tules are thrown out in the manner of tho&s;e proceeding
<PB N="22" REF="21">from Wines mingled with Ar&s;e|nick, where the Quantity has been too &s;mall immediately to offend the Stomach and Guts, which being mixed with the Blood, innumerable Pu&s;tules of bad A&s;pect, of a fiery red kind, ari&s;e like the inocu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated ones, having no regular Increa&s;e, or &s;tated Period for their Declen|&s;ion; but depend wholly on the contaminated Fountain (I mean the Wound) to determine both. While tho&s;e of the natural &s;ort are &s;lowly ejected, and contain at fir&s;t a Latex, or thin watry Sub|&s;tance, which, from the Heat of the Part, thickens, and converts to Pus u&s;ually in the &s;pace of nine D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being covered with a thin and fine Pellicle. The&s;e In|oculated, are at fir&s;t produced from Blood, and are of a hard Sub&s;tance; which &s;hows the
<PB N="23" REF="22">manner of their Propagation to be different from the others; and po&s;&s;ibly the Symptoms from this in&s;u&s;ed Poi&s;on, no more than what might have en&s;u'd from the Infu&s;ion of any other: that it may be ju&s;tly que&s;tioned, Whe|ther this artificial Pox &s;o &s;quares with the natural one, as to de|&s;erve the &s;ame Appellation; much le&s;s, from the Mode of its Operation, &s;hould it &s;ecure to us the Ble&s;&s;ing of having it but once. Be&s;ides, the fortui|tous Contraction of this Di&s;tem|per being from infected Air, the Ve&s;icles of the Lungs may be|come &s;o altered and changed, as to their Texture, as not to &s;uffer Violence from the &s;ame venenate Effluvia a &s;econd time: which cannot be &s;aid of a &s;ermented Matter admitted into the Blood by a Sore, that at any time it
<PB N="24" REF="23">&s;hould prove innocent, though the &s;ame were repeated after a Recovery.</P>
<P>WE will now recite the Symptoms of this inoculated Pox, as &s;et down by Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> in his Book to Dr. <HI>Whittaker,</HI> and &s;how how incon&s;i&s;tent to Rea|&s;on and Self-Pre&s;ervation the Experiment is.</P>
