<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you will not be offended at the liberty I take in recom|mending the following Work to your pro|tection&mdash;And I am the rather confirmed in this hope as well from its Name, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay on Humanity,</HI> as its object, &s;o virtually cor|re&s;ponding with &s;uch name.&mdash;</P>
<P>It has been remarked of Authors, that their writings were the ju&s;te&s;t de&s;cription of their di&s;po&s;itions, and I think the Ob|&s;ervation may with great propriety be ex|tended to their Patrons; for, in the con|&s;titution of human concerns, I believe there has &s;eldom a work been in&s;cribed to a pa|tron, the qualities of who&s;e mind, or di&s;|po&s;itions of who&s;e heart, did not bear a congenial relation&s;hip to the &s;ubject treated of. The Gentleman, which I now have the honor and happine&s;s to addre&s;s, is a liv|ing example of the ju&s;tice of this ob&s;erva|tion, who&s;e private life is one uniform ex|ertion
<PB N="iv" REF="3">of the diffu&s;ive virtues of genero&s;ity and benevolence. It is upon this expanded principle, Sir, that I ground my hopes of your indulgence in patronizing&mdash;An E&s;&s;ay on Humanity, and which, by a &s;pecies of relative attraction, you have drawn to &s;eek &s;helter under your fo&s;tering protection.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here re&s;train the effu&s;ions of a grateful mind, le&s;t malignity might con|&s;true the genuine language of heart-felt gratitude into unworthy adulation&mdash;which I am perfectly confident, you are as much aver&s;e to receive as I am to offer:&mdash;Ju&s;tice, however, demands this public declaration, that whatever benefit (which I hope will not be incon&s;iderable) may hereafter re&s;ult to &s;ociety from the pre&s;ent Performance, will be, principally, attributable to you in con&s;equence of your liberality to the author.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>AS the in&s;titution of public charities is univer&s;ally applauded, &s;o their abu&s;e &s;hould be univer&s;ally condemned: to correct, therefore a public evil of this tendency is the object of the following &s;heets.</P>
<P>The nation is loud in its prai&s;es on the be|nevolence of the Humane Society, in&s;tituted for the recovery of per&s;ons <HI>apparently</HI> dead; and certainly prai&s;e could never be more ju|diciou&s;ly be&s;towed nor more ju&s;tly merited. As a grateful individual of &s;ociety, it claims my particular veneration: and as the plan which I have recommended here, is projected upon the &s;ame principles of indi&s;criminate benevolence, I fondly anticipate a portion of the public approbation for attempting to pro|mote a public good.</P>
<P>The Humane Society may in the exerci&s;e of <HI>ten</HI> experiments be &s;ucce&s;sful perhaps but in <HI>one,</HI> their exertions are neverthele&s;s laud|able: but the in&s;titution of a <HI>Humane Com|mittee</HI> (which I have in the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay recommended to be appointed in ho&s;pi|tals) may exerci&s;e the functions, annexed to it with greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, as, per|haps, that in <HI>ten</HI> attempts to re&s;tore health and prolong life, <HI>one</HI> will not mi&s;carry. As therefore the object of the <HI>Humane Society</HI> is to re&s;cue from premature death our fellow-creatures, &s;urely that in&s;titution formed upon
<PB N="vi" REF="5">&s;imilar principles of univer&s;al benevolence and which has in its comprehen&s;ion the pro|bability of &s;aving Ten for one of the human race, mu&s;t be allowed a decided &s;uperiority, and con&s;equently command a proportionate earne&s;tne&s;s in its being e&s;tabli&s;hed into a &s;y&s;tem of permanency.</P>
<P>I am well apprized, that imputations ad|duced again&s;t public in&s;titutions, or public characters, are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to "take their ri&s;e in envy or di&s;appointment, and not from any di&s;intere&s;ted or public &s;pirited mo|tives." How far the degeneracy of human-nature will ju&s;tify &s;uch an illiberal charge, it is not for me here to inve&s;tigate, therefore &s;hall not attempt to refute the inju&s;tice, or acknowledge the propriety of it: neverthe|le&s;s I think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary thus pub|lickly to declare, that &s;uch motives have not the lea&s;t influence, either immediate or remote, in the pre&s;ent undertaking, and that however &s;ingular the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the times may make the declaration appear, I profe&s;s my&s;elf a volunteer in the cau&s;e of humanity only.</P>
<P>Upon this principle it will not be e&s;teemed pre&s;umptious to hope, that this pamphlet will obtain a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate inve&s;tigation from the benevolent governors and &s;ub&s;cribers to the different ho&s;pitals in and about London, and al&s;o a candid examination of its utility from a di&s;cerning, generous, and impartial public, who&s;e judgment I hope, in this re|&s;pect,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">will be directed by the magnitude of the object recommended by it, and for who&s;e benefit it is avowedly written.</P>
<P>I al&s;o think it nece&s;&s;ary to declare, that I was not influenced by any general di&s;appro|bation I did or do entertain of the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic or &s;urgery, or again&s;t any particu|lar profe&s;&s;or of tho&s;e half-divine arts; on the contrary, it has ever been my opinion, that benevolent and intelligent phy&s;icians and &s;ur|geons, were characters that gave additional dignity to human nature: but the gentlemen of the faculty them&s;elves will be my witne&s;&s;es, when I &s;ay that there are &s;everal characters in the profe&s;&s;ion who do not come &s;trictly under this venerated denomination; and in who&s;e hands a man's life would be in as much dan|ger, as his property in tho&s;e of an unprinci|pled pettifogging attorney.</P>
<P>The &s;arca&s;ms &s;o liberally thrown out again&s;t both profe&s;&s;ions, are the greate&s;t pannigerycks upon the re&s;pectable part of the profe&s;&s;ors.&mdash; It is only for ignorance, in&s;en&s;ibility and in|ju&s;tice, to &s;mart under the rod of &s;atyrical cha&s;ti&s;ement, intelligence, humanity and in|tegrity will be ever above its reach.</P>
<P>That want of literary merit which mu&s;t ever di&s;tingui&s;h maiden productions (and which is &s;o very con&s;picuous in the follow|ing E&s;&s;ay) will I hope in &s;ome mea&s;ure be overlooked by the critic eye of cla&s;&s;ical ac|curacy,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">in con&s;ideration of the benignity of its intention; for though my capacity in pour|traying this &s;ubject in the affecting colours it would admit of, is inferior to many, yet, in a benevolent anxiety for its happy accom|pli&s;hment, I am inferior to none:&mdash;For if ever I could entertain &s;o inordinate a wi&s;h, as to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the captivating, pathetic, and per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of Mr. Burke, it would be, that I might (like him) with more &s;ucce&s;s plead the cau&s;e of humanity.</P>
<P>The antient Romans, the mo&s;t un&s;ullied model of human perfection which hi&s;tory pre&s;ents us with, carried their love of hu|manity to &s;o exalted a pitch, that they decreed the particular honor of a civic crown to every individual who &s;hould &s;ave the life of <HI>one</HI> citizen. This was a generous incitement,&mdash; an honorable &s;timulative to the virtues of humanity and benevolence! And as the Bri|ti&s;h nation is the only living copy on the face of nature of &s;o illu&s;trious an original, I hope that my feeble endeavours, which are level|led at the pre&s;ervation of the lives of <HI>thou|&s;ands</HI> of my fellow-citizens and fellow-crea|tures (in future) will entitle me to the more <HI>envied di&s;tinction</HI>&mdash;their approbation. And though I &s;hould not be &s;o happy as to gain this flattering reward&mdash;yet I &s;hall not relax my per&s;everence in endeavouring to de&s;erve it, by availing my&s;elf of every opportunity of di&s;charging the benevolent duties of A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON HUMANITY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no le&s;s a compliment to the libe|rality and wi&s;dom, than to the huma|nity of Great Britain, that it takes prece|dence of all other &s;tates in Europe for the number, variety, and affluence of its cha|ritable in&s;titutions. The large voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions in &s;upporting ho&s;pitals for every &s;pecies of calamity, entailed on hu|man nature, excite &s;entiments of the mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;ibility in the feeling brea&s;t.&mdash; All benevolent de&s;criptions of mankind mu&s;t &s;ympathetically partake of ble&s;&s;ings thus indi&s;criminately diffu&s;ed. And though our feelings may be wounded, either by the &s;ight or recital of the afflictions in&s;epara|ble from the con&s;titution of human nature, yet we are in a great mea&s;ure con&s;oled by the reflection, that the&s;e man&s;ions of ho&s;|pitality are erected for their alleviation.&mdash; The great ma&s;s of mankind ever has been, and ever will be, formed of two compo|nent parts, good and bad.&mdash;The one ever
<PB N="10" REF="9">&s;olicitous to promote the happine&s;s of their fellow-creatures; the other to counteract the&s;e laudable efforts. This is a truth &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed by the experience of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive ages, that a further commentation on it here, might be ju&s;tly con&s;idered an impertinent prolixity. I am led to this reflection from the wanton abu&s;e which is known but too generally to prevail in the above mentioned god-like in&s;titutions.&mdash; Where avarice and in&s;en&s;ibility in the offi|cers and &s;ervants (not to &s;ay neglect in the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons) belonging to the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments frequently prevent the un|happy patients from receiving that con&s;o|lation in them that the nature of their ma|lady demands, and which was the primi|tive object of their pious and humane foun|ders. To correct the&s;e enormities is the avowed object of the pre&s;ent work, and &s;ucce&s;s in the undertaking, will be to me the mo&s;t acceptable reward of my labour. It will ever be admitted by the advocates for humanity, that the greater the di&s;tre&s;s of the object, the greater his recommen|dation to the care of philanthropy; but &s;ome in&s;tances, which I &s;hall hereafter men|tion, &s;eem to confirm, that they maintain a contrary opinion in ho&s;pitals; and that the greater the di&s;tre&s;s of an object, &s;olicit|ing relief there, the greater the difficulty of removing it &s;hould &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="10">The following circum&s;tance (which may be depended upon as authentic) I &s;hall mention, as well for its &s;ingular cruelty, as a confirmation of the imputation ju&s;t men|tioned Curio&s;ity led me to St. Bartholo|mew's ho&s;pital on a taking-in-day, as it is termed) when a patient was admitted into the ward where I was; and after pa&s;&s;|ing through the extra-formalities nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch admi&s;&s;ion, he was introduced by one of the beadles to the &s;i&s;ter of the ward, who at fir&s;t received him with that affect|ed cordiality and &s;eeming tenderne&s;s which pecuniary expectations make low minds a&s;|&s;ume; after which &s;he a&s;ked him,&mdash;"Had he got his wardage?"&mdash;The unhappy man &s;aid, "He had no money&mdash;That the la&s;t &s;ix-pence he had in the world he gave to the beadle who &s;hewed him into the ward." The <HI>tender</HI> hearted &s;i&s;ter on this informa|tion flew into the mo&s;t outrageous pa&s;&s;ion, and in an imperious elevation of voice, in which were blended in&s;olence, ignorance, and barbarity, demanded, "How he dare come there without it? Did he not know it was cu&s;tomary? and that it was her due or perqui&s;ite?"&mdash;with a number of other interrogatories equally dive&s;ted of decency, as humanity. The trembling patient mo|de&s;tly replied, He believed it might be cu&s;tomary; but alledged his inability as his only rea&s;on for non-compliance to it. This
<PB N="12" REF="11">affecting confe&s;&s;ion, &s;o far from &s;oftening the heart of the inexorable &s;i&s;ter, exa&s;pe|rated her &s;till more, in &s;o much, that &s;he ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted on his turning out of the ward immediately, and actually proceeded to pu&s;h him out: &s;hock'd at &s;uch unexam|pled inhumanity, I arre&s;ted her in the ex|ecution of her unfeeling purpo&s;e.&mdash;"Hold, mon&s;ter, &s;aid I, here is your wardage, and may the gin you procure for it, rid human nature of &s;o great a reproach to it!" This inveterate imprecation I could not re&s;train, in the moment of my indignant re&s;entment and dete&s;tation, for &s;uch unparrallelled in|&s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul!</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave the mind of &s;en&s;ibility to make its native &s;ympathetic comment on unfortunate wretches in the &s;ituation above de&s;cribed, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that &s;uch inhumanity is in diametric oppo&s;ition to the very name and nature of an ho&s;pital; and &s;hews a lamentable degeneracy of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>This perqui&s;ite of wardage operates va|riou&s;ly to the di&s;advantage of patients;&mdash;It makes the &s;i&s;ter look with the eye of anx|iety on the patient in all the progre&s;&s;ive &s;i|tuations and &s;tages of his cure; not from a humane concern for the re&s;toration of his health, but with an avaricious expectation
<PB N="13" REF="12">of having him di&s;charged, as &s;he is to get 3s. from the per&s;on whom accident or de|cea&s;e makes his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and as, perhaps, &s;he has no other bed in her ward to accom|modate &s;uch ca&s;ual &s;ucce&s;&s;or with, but that occupied by &s;ome half-cured patient. It is therefore very evident, that the <HI>number of cures</HI> effected in the ward committed to her <HI>humane</HI> &s;uperintendance, is not &s;o much the object of her &s;olicitude, as the number of patients admitted into it, as &s;he has 3s. for each. It is very rea&s;onable to infer, from this circum&s;tance that her tenderne&s;s will not be much exerted towards the pati|ents: the very rever&s;e is ju&s;tly to be appre|hended, as &s;he mu&s;t know from experience, that moro&s;ene&s;s and brutality might induce &s;ome to quit the ho&s;pital before their cures were accompli&s;hed, though tenderne&s;s and humanity would be an additional induce|ment to them to &s;tay for that very de&s;irable purpo&s;e, to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Another infamous practice of the&s;e wretches, to multiply their perqui&s;ites, is to prefer complaints to the &s;teward again&s;t the unhappy patients; for if in the acute|ne&s;s of their pains they are guilty of the lea&s;t vehement expre&s;&s;ion, they are imme|diately repre&s;ented to the &s;teward as intol|lerably noi&s;y and trouble&s;ome. Thus for not having the con&s;tancy to maintain an
<PB N="14" REF="13">equality of temper in the extremity of pain, they are painted out as intolerable and for no other human rea&s;on, than that perhaps their agonies are &s;o! and a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion &s;oon after, notwith&s;tanding any pathetic remon&s;trance to the contrary, is frequently the con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>This de&s;potic act of power in the <HI>Lord Steward</HI> is faithfully copied by the <HI>Lady Matron</HI> in her department, with this dif|ference only, that the delicacy of the com|plaints, which females frequently labour under, will not di&s;pen&s;e with &s;o immediate a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, but in any circum&s;tances where they will, her plenitude of arbitra|ry authority will be as &s;everely, and as in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly exerci&s;ed; and for the &s;ame iniquitous rea&s;on already mentioned.</P>
<P>Is it not a melancholy con&s;ideration, that the health, or perhaps the life, a u&s;e|ful member of &s;ociety &s;hould thus fall a facrifice either to the avarice of the &s;i&s;ter, or the captice of the &s;teward? and it a|mounts to more than a pre&s;umption, that this is frequently the ca&s;e, when patients are turned out of the ho&s;pital before their cures are effected. The di&s;order, upon the point, perhaps, of being conquered by the regimen pre&s;cribed and followed, when the proce&s;s of medicinal application is inter|rupted,
<PB N="15" REF="14">returns to its wonted &s;trength, at a time that the body is con&s;iderably exhau&s;t|ed by the ab&s;tinence impo&s;ed by regimen: when a conflict between <HI>recruited</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, and <HI>harra&s;&s;ed</HI> nature en&s;ues, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate in human di&s;&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>The number of evils ari&s;ing from this pernicious perqui&s;ite of wardage, are as obvious as they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the poor afflicted part of the community; it is there|fore hoped, the governors and &s;ub&s;cribers to ho&s;pitals will apply a radical cure to the evil, by totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, and &s;ub&s;ti|tute in its room an additional equivalent of &s;alary to the &s;i&s;ters and nur&s;es; for, to the eternal reproach of human nature, I mu&s;t own, that while the degraded princi|ple or pa&s;&s;ion of &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;tands in op|po&s;ition to the di&s;charge of any duty, there will be found very few, e&s;pecially in the inferior orders of mankind, who will not make that duty &s;ub&s;ervient to their intere&s;t, however important to &s;ociety the faithful di&s;charge of &s;uch a tru&s;t may be! And indeed I may venture to affirm, that the ills and calamities <HI>ideally</HI> a&s;cribed to Pan|dora's box, will be <HI>realized</HI> by the conti|nuance of this, with other prohibitions on humanity, which I &s;hall hereafter mention. How many are the unfortunate objects, who
<PB N="16" REF="15">from having large families, painful illne&s;s, or a long want of employment, are in ac|tual want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, it is not therefore &s;trange, that under the pre&s;&s;ure of any, or all of the&s;e calamities, they &s;hould want a few &s;hillings; but it is very &s;trange indeed, that this want &s;hould be the foundation on which the want of being cured is built, as they can not get into the ho&s;pital without it, as has been already &s;ufficiently demon&s;trat|ed? This illu&s;trates and explains that ne|gative text in the &s;cripture, &s;o remarkable for its ob&s;curity, "And from tho&s;e that have nothing, even that which they have will be taken from them."&mdash;It applies immedi|ately to the peculiarly unfortunate wretches I have been ju&s;t de&s;cribing&mdash;having nothing but hope, and even that is taken away from them by this ill-timed rejection of their double claim to compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o cu&s;tomary (nay indeed it is in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, in order to be admit|ted into the ho&s;pitals) for the patient to bring two clean &s;hirts with him be&s;ides the &s;hirt he wears, which mu&s;t be clean al&s;o; to the propriety, decency, and utility of this regulation, I very readily &s;ub&s;cribe, where the circum&s;tances of the patient will admit of a conformity to it. I admit it is al&s;o a co-operative a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the re&s;tora|tion and pre&s;ervation of health in the cour&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="16">of medical application&mdash;for as filth is as obnox ous to health as to &s;en&s;e &s;o is clean|line&s;s as u&s;eful to the one as agreeable to the other. But do all the&s;e rea&s;ons united ju&s;tify the cruelty of rejecting an unhappy patient for non-conformance to this ho&s;pi|tal mandate, e&s;pecially when unrelenting nece&s;&s;ity is the cau&s;e? Will any good, in|tended to be promoted by it, counterba|lance the evil promi&s;cuou&s;ly entailed on every unhappy wretch thus rejected? No&mdash;I am confident it will not! Let us for a moment enter into the thoughts of the unhappy creature thus di&s;appointed.&mdash;All his le&s;s acute &s;orrows, which before lay in a &s;tate of torpitude, are now new-edged by this recent aggravation of his calamities! His poverty, his haple&s;s helple&s;s irremedi|able poverty he ju&s;tly con&s;iders as the cau&s;e of this con&s;ummation of human woe! his mind is alternately torn with the pa&s;&s;ions of grief and de&s;pondence, when he &s;ees even the probability extingui&s;hed of hav|ing his health re-e&s;tabli&s;hed!</P>
<P>Though the above is a melancholy, yet it is a true picture of the human mind bending under the complicated lead of grief, poverty, and pain.&mdash;Therefore, how|ever commendable it may be, to relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures, it
<PB N="18" REF="17">is much more &s;o to prevent them, by the timely exertions of wi&s;dom and liberality in their behalf. For accompli&s;hing &s;o me|ritorious a purpo&s;e, I would recommend it to the governors, &amp;c. to have half a dozen or a dozen of coar&s;e cloth &s;hirts in each ward, and that the &s;i&s;ters and nur&s;es might be ordered to accommodate &s;uch unfortu|nate patients as above de&s;cribed, in &s;uch manner as their re&s;pective nece&s;&s;ities &s;hould demand. The object of additional expence on this occa&s;ion would be very incon&s;ider|able, but when put in competition with the ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting to individuals, and to &s;ociety at large from it, it would entirely vani&s;h. This indulgence not to be extend|ed to any but tho&s;e who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities alone &s;hould entitle them to it. How many u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, by the exten|&s;ion of this well timed benevolence, would be enabled to re&s;ume a life of honourable indu&s;try, who might, through the want of this means of &s;eeking to recover their health, become an incumbrance to &s;ociety, as would al&s;o their relatives, who&s;e imme|diate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was drawn from the exer|ci&s;e of their trade?</P>

<P>It frequently happens, that pari&s;h patients are brought to Ho&s;pitals, to the very great prejudice of the patients who are before warded in them, as the&s;e pari&s;h patients have a di&s;tinction paid them very injurious to the convenience, and &s;ometimes to the health of tho&s;e other patients, who are re|moved out of their beds, though they &s;hould be even in the extremity of a fever, to make room for the pari&s;h patients; and only for the pitiful con&s;ideration of four|pence a day! which the pari&s;h allows in &s;uch ca&s;es; and which becomes the per|qui&s;ite of the &s;ervants belonging to the ho&s;pitals.

<P>With re&s;pect to the quality and quantity of food appointed for the u&s;e of the pati|ents, it appears to me, in a general &s;en&s;e, tolerably well calculated to an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed by it; but notwith&s;tanding, &s;ome alterations and additions might be made in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, exclu&s;ive of the ho&s;|pital

An ab&s;tinence from a &s;ufficiency of food, in a con&s;titution thus circum&s;tanced, lays the foundation of &s;eve|ral di&s;orders&mdash;as belchings, windy cholics, dizzine&s;s in the head, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in juve|nile con&s;titutions it is the undoubted fore|runner of a con&s;umption&mdash;a line of di&s;tinc|tion &s;hould be therefore accurately drawn between tho&s;e who, from the nature and malignity of their complaints, can not <HI>eat &s;o much</HI> as the ho&s;pital allowance, and tho&s;e who from contrary rea&s;ons could <HI>eat more,</HI> without endangering their health, or retard|ing their cure. Such patients &s;hould by all means have an additional allowance, le&s;t the re&s;training them in this particular &s;hould be productive of the unhappy con&s;equences above particularized.</P>
<P>Though this encrea&s;e of food would incur a &s;mall additional expence, yet it would be a temporary one, and in its con&s;equences would prove a &s;aving.

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Having now pointed out &s;ome of the Enormi|ties of the <HI>Servants,</HI> I &s;hall take the Liberty of making &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the Con|duct of the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> belonging to the Ho&s;pitals.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately antecedent to a patient's di&s;|charge from the ho&s;pital, he pa&s;&s;es through a very ridiculous unnece&s;&s;ary formality:&mdash; He is called into a room where the Phy&s;i|cians and Surgeons attend, and a&s;ked&mdash;If he has any complaint again&s;t the &s;i&s;ters or nur&s;es, &amp;c. In the name of common &s;en&s;e I would a&s;k&mdash;admitting he had&mdash;Of what con&s;equence would it, or could it be, to &s;ay &s;o then? What advantage would re&s;ult to him, to tell the gentlemen, That he was not treated with the tenderne&s;s he expect|ed? and which from the intention, as well as con&s;titution of the charity, &s;hould be &s;hewn him? or that the peculiar circum|&s;tances of his complaint demanded:&mdash;Of what utility could it po&s;&s;ibly be to him, ju&s;t at the moment he was to be di&s;charged, to &s;ay, he was not tenderly or carefully nur&s;|ed. Such information now, would, like a malicious accu&s;ation, e&s;pecially when it could not have for its object the redre&s;s of
<PB N="24" REF="23">&s;uch grievances, as to him&s;elf! Had the&s;e que&s;tions been propo&s;ed to him during his re&s;idence in the ho&s;pital, for in&s;tance (the fir&s;t week after his admi&s;&s;ion) the fear of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the gentlemen might exact that tenderne&s;s from the &s;i&s;ters and nur&s;es, which the fear of violating the obligations of humanity could no. This therefore I take to be an after-piece of at|tention, and con&s;equently nugatory and unavailing: for if any thing can equal its ab&s;urdity, it is its palpable inutility.</P>
<P>Without intending the lea&s;t di&s;parage|ment to the re&s;pectibility of their profe&s;|&s;ion, or the integrity of their principles, I would earne&s;tly recommend to the&s;e gen|tlemen a more humane regard to the feel|ings of their unhappy patients. I have fre|quently heard, and beheld with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, gentlemen who arrived to the highe&s;t pitch of eminence in their profe&s;|&s;ion, u&s;e exceeding har&s;h language and ap|parently unfeeling treatment to their pati|ents, when in the mo&s;t agitating mental anxiety, and under the mo&s;t excruciating corporeal pain. This is a conduct which is by no means reconcileable to the dignity of the gentleman, the &s;en&s;ibility of the man, or the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;urgeon. Peo|ple of this a&s;&s;umed or natural au&s;terity of
<PB N="25" REF="24">manners, &s;hould reflect, that there are &s;ome con&s;titutions &s;o delicately con&s;tructed by nature, that though they have arrived to maturity in years, are but infants in the great virtues of patience and re&s;ignation; and con&s;equently require the &s;ame cordia|lity and affability in their treatment.</P>
<P>Another prevailing practice in an ho&s;pital, and which, to excite general indignation, needs only to be mentioned, is, That if a Surgeon's patient has the misfortune to have a leg or an arm dangerou&s;ly afflicted, am|putation is immediately propo&s;ed, without any previous con&s;ultation, whether a po&s;|&s;ibility exi&s;ts of effecting a cure, without having recour&s;e to this de&s;perate alterna|tive! Surely in a matter of &s;uch magni|tude to human nature, as the mutilation or di&s;&s;olution (which frequently follows it) of one of our &s;pecies, it merits the utmo&s;t profe&s;&s;ional deliberation, before &s;uch unre|lenting re&s;olutions are decidedly adopted.&mdash; For, exclu&s;ive of the horrible fears that an|ticipation unavoidably excites in the pa|tient's mind, preparatory to amputation, the excrutiating pain of the operation mu&s;t be inde&s;cribeably great! Why then wanton|ly or incautiou&s;ly condemn a fellow-crea|ture to &s;uch intolerable pains of mind and
<PB N="26" REF="25">body, if there are any po&s;&s;ible human means to avoid it!</P>
<P>But long experience and impartial ob&s;er|vation &s;ugge&s;t to me a con&s;ideration, which at the &s;ame time that it accounts for this inhuman premature propen&s;ity to amputa|tion, reflects very little honour on the prin|ciples of the chirurgical tribe, which is,&mdash; <HI>That experiments of this de&s;perate nature are made on the</HI> POOR, <HI>that they may be practiced with more probability of &s;ucce&s;s on the</HI> RICH. Though this is a har&s;h imputation, yet I con&s;cientiou&s;ly believe it to be true in vari|ous in&s;tances; but, for the honour of hu|man nature, I hope there are a number of exceptions to it.</P>
<P>Indeed I am confident to a&s;&s;ert, and ready to prove, that in many in&s;tances, there is not that attention paid to ho&s;pital patients that there ought to be; for, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;ingular affliction attracts the attention of the gentlemen, the patients frequently lan|gui&s;h under <HI>common complaints</HI> with as little pro&s;pect of redre&s;s <HI>in</HI> the ho&s;pital, as <HI>out.</HI></P>
<P>In order to the &s;ub&s;tantiating what is al|ledged above relating to amputation, I &s;hall recite the following in&s;tance, which came under my own immediate knowledge.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<P>Some few years ago there was a patient in St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, who labour|ed under a violent inflammation in his left arm: a certain great profe&s;&s;ional character, who&s;e amputating abilities are as univer&s;al|ly known as admired, ordered amputation immediately on the fir&s;t &s;ight of the arm, without ever con&s;ulting the patient, or giv|ing him&s;elf a moment's time to enquire into his habit of body, or di&s;po&s;ition of mind, on &s;o momentous an event. The man anticipated his advice from his general character, but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to comply with it, very rationally con&s;idering, that if a cour&s;e of medicine was pre&s;cribed, for the purpo&s;e of correcting and purifying the blood, it would probably abate the in|flammation, and on that event's taking place, external applications might operate more effectually. This rea&s;onable expec|tation was &s;oon afterwards ju&s;tified, for in le&s;s than the &s;hort &s;pace of a month, the patient was di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital with his arm perfectly healed! a living mo|nument of the cruelty and ju&s;tice of hav|ing recour&s;e to amputation, unle&s;s in ca&s;es where the unequivocal &s;ymptoms of mor|tification make it indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. I have every rea&s;on to apprehend the in|&s;tances of &s;uch cruel inattention are not few, nor the &s;till more cruel con&s;equences
<PB N="28" REF="27" MS="y">with which they are attended; nor can the circum&s;tance of this unrelenting practice, not being more generally known, in the lea&s;t invalidate the probability of tho&s;e humane apprehen&s;ions being ju&s;t, as can be very rationally inferred from the ca&s;e ju&s;t mentioned.</P>

<P>Having now repre&s;ented what bodily in|conveniencies patients labour under, I &s;hall proceed to examine the inattention &s;hewn to the &s;till more exalted and important concern, their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Ingratitude, it is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, is a crime of Syrian dye; but alas! it is a crime from which very few of the human race can plead an exemption; particularly to that &s;upreme Being who&s;e mercies to us demand our mo&s;t animated gratitude! while in the meridian of health and pro&s;perity we neglect tho&s;e great duties we <HI>ought</HI> to perform, and which, when de&s;cended under the clouded horizon of &s;ickne&s;s and adver&s;ity, we <HI>cannot</HI> perform. It is in this &s;tate the mind re&s;umes its &s;alutary attribute of reflection&mdash;It is then &s;he would wi&s;h, by a life of prudence and penance in fu|ture,
<PB N="29" REF="28">to ward off calamities which ante|cedent intemperance or impiety make her dread for the pre&s;ent, both as to body and &s;oul! When the human mind is in this &s;u&s;ceptible di&s;po&s;ition, a wi&s;e and humane clergyman &s;hould avail him&s;elf of its &s;itu|ation (as in it we are more inclined to hear and follow good advice than at any other time) by vi&s;iting patients in &s;uch &s;ituati|ons, and admoni&s;hing them to refrain from a repetition of tho&s;e irregularities, which perhaps laid the foundation of their pre&s;ent &s;ickne&s;s; and that &s;uch &s;ickne&s;s was the con&s;equent puni&s;hment, of their criminal neglect of the performance of their religi|ous duty:" or in any other pathetic manner, that the love or duty of Chri&s;tianity might dictate.&mdash;For, as the &s;tate of heat, in me|tallic &s;ub&s;tances, is the &s;tate wherein they are made capable to a&s;&s;ume new or beau|tiful forms, &s;o the &s;tate of affliction is the &s;tate to mould the human mind to every pur&s;uit that is congenial to the dignity of its nature. But, I am extremely &s;orry to &s;ay, that there is very little attention paid to the di&s;charge of this indi&s;pen&s;ible duty in an ho&s;pital; more e&s;pecially at the time that it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, towards the ap|proach of death!&mdash;For, it is truly lamen|table to &s;ee, how &s;hamefully negligent in this momentous concern, are the people

I would not dwell &s;o long on this matter, but from an internal conviction, that vir|tue and good morals are as often the means of <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> health, as medicine is in <HI>re|&s;toring</HI> it.

<P>Having now &s;hewn the neglect and abu&s;e of ho&s;pitals, I &s;hall proceed to the method of correcting them; and in their room to recommend regulations which, if adopted, will be productive of the mo&s;t &s;alutary ef|fects, with very little additional expence to the in&s;titutions. For the accompli&s;hment of this de&s;irable purpo&s;e, I would re|commend it to the governors, &s;ub&s;cribers, &amp;c. to appoint a committee from among&s;t them&s;elves, to be called, <HI>The Humane Com|mittee,</HI> who&s;e office might be to examine minutely into the arrangement and treatment of the patients; to di&s;cover any neglect or inattention to the cure of their re&s;pective maladies, in order as well to remedy them, as trace out the &s;ource from which &s;uch inhuman negligence originates.</P>
<P>This Committee &s;hould have a di&s;creti|onary power from the governors, &amp;c. to examine, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous atten|tion, the di&s;po&s;ition and character of tho&s;e who are candidates for any office, internal or external, belonging to ho&s;pitals.

<PB N="32" REF="31">
<P>What life did they lead antecedent to this particular period? whether moral or debauched? religious or profligate?</P>

<P>And particularly, what was generally re|puted to be the natural bent of their di&s;|pofition; whether moro&s;e or humane? for, from the man of humanity, the di&s;charge of all &s;ocial obligation is as rea&s;onably expected, as their violation is to be appre|hended from a man of a contrary &s;tamp.</P>
<P>If the candidates could undergo a liberal examination of this tendency, corroborat|ed by &s;ome re&s;pectable characters of their acquaintance, they might with propriety be admitted, otherwi&s;e not.</P>
<P>This would infallibly annihilate partial recommendation&mdash;the contaminated &s;ource from which various evils flow to the hu|man race&mdash;as there is no line of di&s;crimi|nation or di&s;tinction drawn by it, between the worthy and unworthy, often be&s;towing upon ignorance and inhumanity appoint|ments, to which in moral rectitude geni|us,
<PB N="33" REF="32">us and philanthropy have the ju&s;te&s;t claim. I am very well convinced from my ob&s;er|vations on human nature in the melancho|ly &s;tages of perturbation of &s;pirit, and cor|poreal pain, that a patient's cure is as much accelerated by the tenderne&s;s and humanity of the nur&s;e, as by the mo&s;t obedient con|formity to the pre&s;criptions of the doctor; and that to effectuate a cure in the body, I hold it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain peace in the mind. It is evident from this, how e&s;&s;ential it is to the health of a patient, to have an affectionate tender nur&s;e; and con&s;equently how nece&s;&s;ary the precaution here recommended for the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch&mdash;as al&s;o the rejection of &s;uch others, as do not fall under this denomination.</P>

<P>The committee &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of about eight per&s;ons, of which number a phy&s;i|cian and &s;urgeon &s;hould always make two. The nece&s;&s;ity of adding profe&s;&s;ional gen|tlemen

<PB N="38" REF="37">far as courage is nece&s;&s;ary to the perform|ance of tho&s;e hazardous undertakings; but this admi&s;&s;ion by no means implies, that <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility</HI> is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in the con&s;titution of a &s;urgeon: the contrary, as has been already &s;hewn, is the ca&s;e. He mu&s;t &s;et out with very <HI>little</HI> humanity in|deed, who has lo&s;t it <HI>all</HI> before he has ac|quired &s;o much knowledge in his profe&s;&s;ion as will in &s;ome &s;ort apologize for the want of it. But as the con&s;ideration of youth makes this matter as much the object of admonition as reprehen&s;ion, I would re|commend it to tho&s;e young gentlemen to con&s;ider, that humanity will always &s;tamp a dignity on the profe&s;&s;ion, which moro&s;e|ne&s;s will rob it of; and that in their en|deavours to become &s;urgeons, they &s;hould never forget&mdash;that they are men&mdash;and gen|tlemen&mdash;appellations, to which a per&s;eve|rance in an unfeeling conduct of this kind, will utterly exclude them from having the lea&s;t pretentions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Humane Committee</HI> &s;hould vi&s;it the ho&s;pital every week, that is, a phy&s;ician and three other members, one week; and a &s;urgeon and three other members, the next; and &s;o on alternately: but if the intervention of any unexpected or extraor|dinary circum&s;tance made it nece&s;&s;ary, ac|cording as each divi&s;ion informed the other, the whole to attend.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="38">
<P>That in the cour&s;e of the&s;e joint exa|minations, they &s;hould make a report to the governors or &s;ub&s;cribers, &amp;c. at their ge|neral meetings of every thing, which in the cour&s;e of &s;uch enquiry, pre&s;ented it&s;elf to them as a proper object of reformation or correction, which mu&s;t be collected prin|cipally from the &s;tate and information of the patients&mdash;&s;uch as inattention, &s;everity, or partiality, or any other inconvenience ari&s;ing to the patients by omi&s;&s;ion or com|mi&s;&s;ion, from the &s;ervants, nur&s;es, &amp;c. either by a cen&s;urable neglect, or a wanton violation of the &s;acred obligations of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>It will probably be objected here, by &s;ome critic who has more <HI>imaginary</HI> wi&s;|dom than <HI>real</HI> humanity, that giving a power of &s;o exten&s;ive a latitude to <HI>one phy&s;ician</HI> and <HI>one &s;urgeon,</HI> as to &s;uperin|tend the practice and conduct of all the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons attending each re|&s;pective ho&s;pital, where this regulation &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, would multiply the evil it was calculated to remove, by being productive of profe&s;&s;ional alteration. But this objection will be entirely obviated, when it is con&s;idered, that the phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon belonging to the <HI>Humane Com|mittee</HI> being inverted with no further au|thority, than to &s;ee that the patients <HI>are
<PB N="40" REF="39">not neglected in their re&s;pective profe&s;&s;ional department,</HI> their office con&s;equently can|not be con&s;idered as a tribunal to bring characters of well e&s;tabli&s;hed abilities in their profe&s;&s;ion, to the bar of examination. Their abilities are not the &s;ubject or object of the committee's enquiry: it is the im|partial, attentive and humane exerci&s;e of tho&s;e abilities which will fall under their inve&s;tigation. And as the idea of their &s;uperior abilities is generally and I think ju&s;tly acquie&s;ced in, &s;o the exerci&s;e of them in the line of their dute &s;hould be enforced. Merit, it is true, is the principal recom|mendation to any public employment whatever; but it is not the only one, for next to the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of know|ing any public profe&s;&s;ional duty is that of &s;aithfully performing it. But care &s;hould be always taken in accurately drawing a line of di&s;tinction between <HI>accidental</HI> and <HI>intentional</HI> guilt. That is, acting contrary to the &s;pirit of the in&s;titution from <HI>igno|rance,</HI> or from <HI>a depravity of &s;entiment.</HI> It will in &s;uch ca&s;es be in the di&s;cretion of the Committee to proportion the puni&s;h|ment to the crime.</P>
<P>This committee &s;hould be perpetual, as well to prevent future, as to correct pre&s;ent abu&s;es. It &s;hould be cho&s;en annually, or quarterly, &amp;c. as the wi&s;dom of the go|vernours
<PB N="41" REF="40">&s;hould point out, or as the nece&s;&s;ity of the patients might demand. A &s;alary to be appointed to the u&s;e of the phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, bearing proper proportion to their merit, and the fidelity with which they would be found to di&s;charge the humane appoint|ment they &s;hould be now called to.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom and experience have found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary in di&s;charging the great commercial con&s;titutional duties of the &s;tate, to in&s;titute reciprocal checques in the different departments of it&mdash;and to this in&s;titution is principally owing the fidelity with which the&s;e important tru&s;ts are di&s;charged. The rule will immedi|ately apply to the di&s;charge of the offices of humanity in ho&s;pitals,&mdash;and &s;urely the one is not le&s;s important than the other&mdash;con&s;e|quently demands an equal vigilance in its ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>I would have the <HI>Humane Committee</HI> &s;ee that the clergyman &s;hould vi&s;it the ho&s;pital every day&mdash;preparing tho&s;e that are <HI>likely to die,</HI> for &s;o tremendous a change, and admoni&s;hing tho&s;e that are <HI>likely to live,</HI> to pur&s;ue the paths of virtue, as the mo&s;t likely means of pre&s;erving future health, and procuring hap|pine&s;s&mdash;for it is an indelible reproach to Chri&s;tianity, the general neglect of this great&mdash;this important con&s;ideration at pre&s;ent. And as divines in general are not remarkable for doing <HI>more</HI> than their duty, I would &s;ee that
<PB N="42" REF="41" MS="y">in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e they &s;hould not do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>le&s;s.</HI> And that this additional labour &s;hould not militate again&s;t <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t, they &s;hould have an additional &s;alary for performing it. This would make <HI>their</HI> duty <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t.&mdash;and I believe (without intending any offence to the cloth) I may &s;ay would be <HI>one rea&s;on</HI> why they would perform &s;uch duty with alacrity.</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations to enforce the foregoing Motives of Reform.</HEAD>
<P>Though the internal regulations of ho&s;pi|tals may vary in particulars, yet their general object is the &s;ame. They are all appropriat|ed to &s;ome benevolent purpo&s;e or other&mdash;for the relief of human mi&s;ery, in whatever vari|ety of &s;hapes it may a&s;&s;ume, and to comfort the comfortle&s;s. As this is a fact univer|&s;ally known, what I write re&s;pecting <HI>one</HI> ap|plies to <HI>all.</HI> I therefore mo&s;t pathetically re|commend a general enquiry to be made into the abu&s;es here complained of&mdash;and &s;incerely wi&s;h, that a general reformation may be the con&s;equence. There cannot be a more ample field for the exerci&s;e of general benevo|lence than &s;uch an inve&s;tigation&mdash;and if en|tered upon with the &s;pirit of unanimity, mu&s;t re&s;cue the national character from the illiberal, though unju&s;t imputation of foreigners, on the intolerable abu&s;e of our public charities, who &s;ay, "That there are very few monu|ments of our humanity here be&s;ides &s;tone!"</P>
<PB N="43" REF="42">
<P>I have chalked out the foregoing line for accompli&s;hing this much-to be-wi&s;hed-for re|formation, without being the lea&s;t tenacious, whether the plan I have delineated will be <HI>literally</HI> pur&s;ued or not. To the &s;uperior wi&s;|dom of the governors, &amp;c. I implicitly &s;ub|mit my humble efforts, in recommending a better regulation in our ho&s;pitals than at pre|&s;ent characterizes them, and if the <HI>moae</HI> I have &s;ugge&s;ted does not meet their approbation, as to <HI>manner,</HI> I have the plea&s;ure to anticipate it will be adopted as to <HI>matter.</HI> It is indifferent to me <HI>what means are pur&s;ued &s;o the end is ob|tained.</HI> An effectual reformation of the a|bu&s;es here alluded to, was my motive in tak|ing up my pen, and I have a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in hoping, that the co-operation of the go|vernors, &amp;c. will bring, to a benevolent con|clu&s;ion, what I had the good fortune to begin, not doubting, but their humanity will adopt the hint, and their wi&s;dom point out the mo&s;t effectual means of carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>The French nation (though di&s;tingui&s;hed for peculiar levity and national volatility) are by no means dive&s;ted of the exalted feelings of humanity. Their ho&s;pitals are many, and under excellent regulations, particularly &s;ince a reformation of the nature here recommend|ed has taken place there, which brought to light a number of enormities that otherwi&s;e would have lain covered in the oblivion of venality. But there is not &s;o exten&s;ive a field
<PB N="44" REF="43">for abu&s;e in their charities as in ours&mdash;as in point of wealth our ho&s;pitals have a decided &s;uperiority&mdash;and this advantage, which could be converted to the additional accommodation of the&s;e receptacles of affliction, is one of the &s;ources from whence the majority of the evils here complained of flow&mdash;for, exten|&s;ive wealth will ever give birth to peculation, and peculation to infidelity, in the di&s;charge of lucrative tru&s;ts.&mdash;</P>
<P>As it mu&s;t be admitted, that we frequently copy the fa&s;hionable ab&s;urdities of our Gallic neighbours, let us convince <HI>them</HI> and <HI>the world,</HI> that we are al&s;o capable of imitating their virtues, by adopting a plan &s;imilar to that they have pur&s;ued, for correcting the flagrant abu&s;es committed in the admini&s;|tration of our public charities: a work, which whoever &s;ets on foot, that will redound no le&s;s to <HI>their</HI> immortal honour, than the endow|ments of the&s;e ho&s;pitals do to their godlike founders, and will, in conjunction with &s;uch dignified names, hand <HI>theirs</HI> down to the late&s;t po&s;terity, with the veneration and re&s;pect, that di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and humanity will ever re|ceive from a &s;en&s;ible and generous people.</P>
<P>Humanity is the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tic of human perfection&mdash;any man di|ve&s;ted of it, &s;hould be dive&s;ted of all the &s;o|cial privileges of a <HI>rational</HI> being. It is in
<PB N="45" REF="44">man, what mercy is in the gracious author of our exi&s;tence! and the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of excellence our nature (con&s;idering its in&s;eparable imperfections) is capable of arriving at, is to be humane&mdash;It comprehends every &s;ocial obligation that unites man to man. Religion is but a name, and man a two leg|ged mon&s;ter without it. As humanity is therefore the unadulterated religion of nature, I would wi&s;h to impre&s;s this con&s;equential truth on the minds of mankind; THAT AN EXTERNAL CONFORMITY TO GOSPEL IN|JUNCTIONS, CAN NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE TO GOD, UNACCOMPANIED BY INTERNAL MOTIVES OF HUMANITY, AND THE AC|TUAL DISCHARGE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS.</P>
<P>The love of God is religion; the love of man, humanity. So that it is evident it is no le&s;s a Chri&s;tian duty, <HI>"To love God above all things, than our neighbours as our&s;elves."</HI>&mdash; The latter duty, left unperformed, makes the pretentions to the former as ab&s;urd as impious. How nece&s;&s;ary therefore to recommend and enforce this &s;econdary obligation of mankind! e&s;pecially as our own happine&s;s is &s;o immedi|ately connected with the di&s;charge of this benevolent duty&mdash;as we have the mo&s;t une|quivocal a&s;&s;urance, from the divine author of our redemption, that if we act with huma|nity towards our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren, he will act with mercy towards us; that is, if we &s;hew benevolence, we &s;hall find mercy. This
<PB N="46" REF="45">is a con&s;ideration of the greate&s;t magnitude that can po&s;&s;ibly attract the attention. or ex|erci&s;e the rational faculties of man! and con|&s;equently the mo&s;t u&s;eful to be preached and practiced. This is the religion which every man &s;hould <HI>openly profe&s;s</HI> and <HI>inwardly believe;</HI> and in which no man need be a&s;hamed to live or afraid to die! Humanity with any &s;y&s;tem of Chi&s;tian religion mu&s;t be acceptable to hea|ven; any without it, an abomination!</P>
<P>I hope therefore the united motives of Chri&s;tianity and humanity will animate every generous &s;park of benevolence in the mind of the governors, &amp;c. (in which tho&s;e vir|tues appeared to be &s;u&s;pended by &s;uffering with impunity the abu&s;es and neglects here complained of), and that they will accord|ingly take &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps as will guard tho&s;e benevolent in&s;titutions from abu&s;e, neg|lect, or degeneracy. What a heart-felt con|gratulation it mu&s;t be to them, in every &s;ub|&s;equent &s;tage of life, to reflect, that at one and the &s;ame time, they have di&s;charged the &s;acred duties of Chri&s;tianity, and complied with the natural dictates of humanity! but, on the contrary, how agonizing would it be to their exalted &s;en&s;ibility, to apprehend that tho&s;e pious and humane intentions &s;hould be counteracted by the depravity of the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the execution of them. The native benevolence of his own mind, prevents a good man from even &s;u&s;pecting that &s;uch
<PB N="47" REF="46">depraved characters as are here de&s;cribed, have an exi&s;tence&mdash;his own innate goodne&s;s being the &s;tandard by which he charitably, tho' erro|neou&s;ly, e&s;timates the characters of others by: but though this un&s;u&s;picious good-nature is the mo&s;t infallible characteri&s;tic of a generous mind; yet it by no means implies a nece&s;&s;ary knowledge of mankind, for it is well known, that both in principle and practice, no two di&s;tinct things, &s;tand in more diametric op|po&s;ition to one another, than man and man. It is therefore but half of a good man's duty to <HI>act well him&s;elf;</HI> the other half con&s;i&s;ts in making <HI>tho&s;e</HI> under his immediate controul <HI>act well al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>In a matter of &s;uch importance to &s;ociety at large, as the re&s;toration of the health of perhaps &s;ome thou&s;ands, &s;o as to be enabled to re&s;ume lives of independent indu&s;try, too much care cannot be taken, to &s;ee that the operations for &s;o &s;alutary a purpo&s;e are not retarded by the intervention of any &s;ini&s;ter or intere&s;ted motives, or even by the neglect of tho&s;e, who&s;e immediate province it is to &s;ee the&s;e benevolent purpo&s;es carried into execu|tion. Humanity is capable of degenerating into a criminal forgivene&s;s in good-natured minds. From this mi&s;guided notion of its principle, good-natured men frequently for|give through compa&s;&s;ion, what they ought to puni&s;h through ju&s;tice. This error they are in&s;en&s;ibly led into by endeavouring to a|void
<PB N="48" REF="47">the oppo&s;ite character of &s;everity. But, it &s;hould be engraved with an damantine pencil, on tablets of the mo&s;t la&s;ting temper|ed &s;teel, as a maxim for the regulation of the conduct of mankind&mdash;<HI>That there &s;hould always be a</HI> WREATH <HI>for the</HI> ADVOCATES, <HI>and a</HI> ROD <HI>for the</HI> ENEMIES <HI>of Humanity.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall make no apology for the above di|gre&s;&s;ion, from a conviction, that my humane readers will coincide with me in the opinion, that any deviation from the immediate &s;ubject which is calculated to enforce the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that exi&s;ts of a reformation in our Ho&s;pitals (and al&s;o the general good likely to ari&s;e from it) cannot be con&s;idered as un|intere&s;ting or unimportant.</P>
<P>Should the adoption of the foregoing hints of reformation be thought likely to conduce to the obtaining the ends propo&s;ed, <HI>The Hu|mane Committee</HI> would, in the exerci&s;e of their new-inve&s;ted authority, inavoidably be pre&s;ent|ed with numberle&s;s objects of <HI>correction</HI> and <HI>reformation</HI> at the &s;ame time. This con&s;ider|ation re&s;trains a great many particulars; which I otherwi&s;e would here recommend to their attention. But &s;hould I have the happine&s;s to &s;ee, that the&s;e labours of mine &s;hould be productive of an enquiry into the abu&s;es al|luded to, and that any con&s;equent re&s;olutions &s;hould be entered into for the final accom|pli&s;hment of &s;o benevolent a purpo&s;e, I will
<PB N="49" REF="48">chearfully give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the power of my circum&s;cribed abilities, towards &s;ugge&s;t|ing or dige&s;ting a plan, for the better di&s;po&s;i|tion and arrangement of the reformation here recommended; and for the facilitating and carrying into execution, &s;uch a &s;cheme in all its po&s;&s;ible latitude, and with as little <HI>additi|onal</HI> expence as may be, to the re&s;pective in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>There is &s;hortly, it is reported, a general regulation and reformation intended to take place in our pri&s;ons and work hou&s;es by a revi&s;ion of the &s;tatutes relating to them. I devoutly wi&s;h it may be true! for humanity calls loudly for it. Why &s;hould <HI>the temporary legi&s;lators</HI> of ho&s;pitals be backward in <HI>&s;etting</HI> or <HI>copying</HI> &s;o laudable an example?
