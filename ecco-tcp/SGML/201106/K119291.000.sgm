<HEAD>REMARKS ON Dr. LEAKE's PAPER ON THE USE OF HIS FORCEPS.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent confu&s;ion, I &s;hall examine the doctrine laid down in each paragraph, according to the order in which they ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. The de&s;cription of the Forceps is not correct. The Forceps ought to be con&s;idered as an In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ting of two Levers, acting alternately from two centres, which are tho&s;e parts of the child's head undergoing the greate&s;t friction. It is true, that with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, the centre of motion will be at that part where the blades unite; but when in the hands of the Operator, and containing a body within their Curve, the alternate motion nece&s;&s;ary for the extraction of that body through a &s;mall &s;pace, changes the whole circum&s;tance. Then all that part of the blades, not bearing upon the child's head, becomes an additional length of Lever.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P N="2">II. Profe&s;&s;ors have generally mi&s;led us in the pur&s;uit of practical knowledge, being too often of that order of men, who are the bane of real improvement. <Q><HI>"Inquirunt,</HI></Q> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> <Q><HI>non quomodo res &s;unt, &s;ed quid alii dicunt".</HI></Q> I believe there are rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;pecting that M. <HI>Crantz</HI> is but little qualified for laying down rules for the u&s;e of In&s;truments in Midwifery; and M. <HI>Levrette</HI> is not unexceptionable authority: The latter however &s;et an example highly worthy of imitation, when he condemned the u&s;e of his Tire Tete, after having univer&s;ally recommended it in the unexperienced part of his Life.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> &s;ays, <Q>"When the Child's head is wedged within the bones of the Pelvis, it cannot be extracted by <HI>Smellie</HI>'s Forceps, becau&s;e of their &s;hortne&s;s; and when the Hind-head is forced over the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes, it cannot be got hold of, within the Curve of the Blades, becau&s;e they are only curved in one direction, and being applied along the Ears, they are apt to &s;lip over the Face, more e&s;pecially as they are taper towards the point".</Q></P>
<P>When the Head is <HI>incuneatum, enclave&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>wedged</HI> in the Pelvis, it is a ca&s;e in which Forceps of any kind cannot be u&s;ed with prudence. If we did try them, we &s;hould happily mi&s;carry in the attempt; for if we &s;ucceeded, dreadful would be the con&s;equence to the &s;oft parts of the Mother, cru&s;hed between the Child's head and Forceps on one hand and the bones of the Pelvis on the other.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the Hind-head is forced over the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes. Whenever this is the ca&s;e, it is not po&s;&s;ible to apply Forceps of any kind with advantage, or without the utmo&s;t danger; and I call upon every Gentleman conver&s;ant in practice to confirm the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion. This &s;ituation can only be occa&s;ioned by the projection of the Sacrum and la&s;t Vertebrae of the Loins. The Doctrine of applying Forceps before the bulk of the Head has pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis, carries great danger and un&s;ur|mountable
<PB N="4" REF="4">difficulties on the face of it. Tho&s;e who have endeavoured to reduce it to practice (for it is an old and ob&s;olete doctrine) have in their accounts given us hi&s;tories of their attempting it, of the diffi|culties they met with, of the mi&s;chief they did and a retraction of their errors.</P>
<P>The Cen&s;ure on Dr. <HI>Smellie</HI>'s Forceps is unprofitable. He was a man of great Candour, Indu&s;try and Ingenuity, and we are all indebted to him. Perhaps he pur&s;ued his favourite opinion too far, but let us attribute his errors to the common infirmity of Human Nature. Dr. <HI>Smellie</HI>'s Forceps are not taper at the point.</P>
<P>The only po&s;&s;ible advantage to be reaped from the third blade of the Forceps, is, the prevention of their &s;lipping over the face, which does not happen once in a hundred times, if the Forceps are properly applied and the head of the child be low enough for their application.</P>
<P N="3">III. Independent of the dimen&s;ions of the Pelvis, it is well known that there are many ca&s;es which require the u&s;e of the Forceps.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Objections are made to the u&s;e of the Forceps, 'till the bulk of the head of a child has pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis, not only for the rea&s;on &s;pecified by Dr. <HI>Leake,</HI> but al&s;o be|cau&s;e force cannot be exerted in a proper direction. It is true that terrible accidents have followed from the cau&s;es here mentioned; &s;eldom of nece&s;&s;ity however, but generally from mi&s;management or innatention after delivery. They do not happen near &s;o frequently when a Labor is wholly re&s;igned to the efforts of Nature, as when the Forceps are injudiciou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P N="5">V. The largene&s;s of the Head and the narrowne&s;s of the Pelvis are relative Terms. However de&s;irable it might be to deliver a Woman under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Facts prove, that if the bulk of
<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">the head is not de&s;cended through the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis, the attempt with Forceps would be fruitle&s;s with re&s;pect to the living Child and exceedingly pernicious with re&s;pect to the Mother.</P>
<P>No Practitioner who has a competent knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ever thinks of turning a Child when the head has entered the Pelvis and the Uterus is contracted. If the head is wedged in the Pelvis, this operation is ab&s;olutely impracticable.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed in this paragraph, I believe never can happen at the upper part of the Pelvis; if it is meant at the lower part, the ca&s;e requires no In&s;truments. For before it is perfectly turned, the Hind-head begins to emerge from under the arch of the Pubes. All pre&s;entations of the head, with regard to in&s;trumental delivery, may be devided into two kinds;&mdash;with the face to the Sacrum;&mdash;or to the Pubes. Yet neither of the&s;e are exact at the time when it is judged nece&s;&s;ary or proper to apply In&s;truments. At the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis the head de&s;cends with one ear to the Pubes, with the other to the Sacrum, or diagonally. As it progredes it nece&s;&s;arily turns to one of the general pre&s;entations, and it is compelled to this turn by the converging form of the internal &s;urface of the Pelvis, and by the &s;pinal proce&s;&s;es of the I&s;chia. Now the Head is not placed with the Ears to each &s;ide, but diagonally, in all ca&s;es, <HI>invariably,</HI> when it is nece&s;&s;ary to apply the Forceps. When they are applied, if the action be gentle with them, as it ought, the head will be turned, without our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, into the mo&s;t favourable po&s;ition, as in a natural Delivery. My rea&s;on for preferring the &s;treight Forceps is a conviction that this opinion is true, and that under the&s;e circum|&s;tances the curvilinear Forceps become inconvenient, except with regard to the pre&s;ervation of the Perinaeum. I do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not think any one ca&s;e &s;ufficient for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any practice.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I know enough of the hi&s;tory of Vectes, in as able hands as
<PB N="6" REF="6"><HI>Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s, to convince a rea&s;onable man that much mi&s;chief may be and has been done by them. It is not &s;ufficient to know that Women have been delivered; we &s;hould be acquainted with the general events, or we cannot form any comparative judgement of the pro|priety of this or that Practice. <HI>Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s Vectis changes it's centre of action, and though it may be fir&s;t fixed again&s;t the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes, the Ramus of the I&s;chium, near the obtu&s;e proce&s;s, mu&s;t become the Fulcrum, or you will not be able to extract the head. I allow his In&s;trument to be very dangerous, but not to &s;uch a degree as the Forceps applied and acting before the bulk of the head has pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The application of a third blade is as free from danger as of either of the other blades.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The re&s;i&s;ting point is not particularly where the Hind-head pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Pubes;&mdash;the head is <HI>wedged</HI> and pre&s;&s;es on many points.</P>
<P>X. The line of action will certainly be from the extremity of the curve. Without great caution, when the curved Forceps are intro|duced, we &s;hall fix them on a part we do not mean, and when we act with them, we &s;hall do it in a wrong direction.</P>
<P>The uniformity of the compre&s;&s;ive force does not prevent the laceration of the Perinaeum; but &s;lowne&s;s in acting and a recollection that the Vagina has an axis different from that of the Pelvis. Compre&s;&s;ive force is not intended in the u&s;e of the Forceps, but it alway sis produced,</P>
<P>XI. There is a po&s;&s;ibility of exerting in&s;initely more power with every kind of Forceps that has been contrived, than can be u&s;ed, if we attend either to the &s;afety of the Mother or Child. The de&s;igns of Nature are effected very &s;lowly. The only method by which we can
<PB N="7" REF="7">avoid every inconvenience which attends the u&s;e of the Forceps, is by imitating the progre&s;s of a Natural Delivery.</P>
<P>XII. Great advantages are &s;aid to be obtained by the u&s;e of Forceps curved, though of the common &s;ize. I object to the u&s;e of all curvilinear Forceps, becau&s;e the head of the Child is <HI>always</HI> in a diagonal &s;ituation when it is proper or nece&s;&s;ary to apply them The curve of M. <HI>Levrette</HI>'s Forceps &s;eems the mo&s;t convenient, and Mr. <HI>O&s;born</HI> has contrived a very elegant pair, by dimini&s;hing the &s;ize of <HI>Levrette</HI>'s and very little alteration be&s;ides.</P>
<P>XIII. Allowing Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> the full force of his own rea&s;oning, I cannot conceive the advantage ari&s;ing from this complicated In&s;tru|ment. But the ca&s;e is really thus:</P>
<P>If we act with the Forceps, from handle to handle, the third blade can do no &s;ervice, but mu&s;t do much mi&s;chief by brui&s;ing the &s;oft parts.</P>
<P>If we act with the Lever, the Forceps are u&s;ele&s;s or prejudicial.</P>
<P>I pay great regard to Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s abilities, but being convinced that the In&s;trument which he has recommended will do great mi&s;|chief, if the attempt to introduce it into practice &s;hould &s;ucceed, I have taken the trouble of writing the&s;e Remarks.</P>
