<HEAD>TO THE MASTERS <HI>or</HI> GOVERNORS OF THE <HI>My&s;tery and Commonalty of</HI> BARBERS <HI>and</HI> CHIRUR|GEONS <HI>of</HI> London.</HEAD>
<P>_NOT doubting but you will be very ready to join in any Thing that may be of U&s;e to Mankind; and I having pra|cti&s;ed Surgery many Years, and al&s;o been acquainted with the Practice of many of the mo&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="3">eminent of our Profe&s;&s;ion, who hone&s;tly and &s;ucce&s;sfully practi|&s;ed it: Yet, being of Opinion, that Surgery might &s;till be ve|ry much improved, by publi&s;h|ing &s;uch Ca&s;es as de&s;erve it; and thinking you the mo&s;t pro|per Per&s;ons to encourage it; therefore am de&s;irous, and &s;hould be glad, you would appoint &s;ome of your Members to re|ceive, and fairly and favourably examine and con&s;ider &s;uch Ca|&s;es as &s;hall be offered to them by long experienced Practitio|ners, and give your Approba|tion of &s;uch as de&s;erve to be made publick. This, I conceive, would very much contribute to the Reputation of Surgery, and be of great Advantage to Pa|tients.
<PB N="3" REF="4">And, to &s;hew how &s;in|cere I am in what I propo&s;e, I here offer to your &s;erious Con|&s;ideration a Ca&s;e I formerly communicated to &s;ome Phy&s;i|cians and Surgeons, and Sir <HI>Hans Sloan</HI> de&s;iring me, I, in the Year 1721, left the following Ac|count in his Hands.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1715, I was &s;ent for to a Man who had a Mortification on the Foot, from an internal Cau&s;e, the Fever very high, attended with the irregular Pul&s;e that is u&s;ual in the Ca&s;e; I made deep Inci|&s;ions into the Part mortified to the Bone, and &s;carified all round as far as there was any Inflama|tion, and u&s;ed the common Ap|plications;
<PB N="4" REF="5">upon which the Fe|ver abated, the Pul&s;e became not only calm, but al&s;o regu|lar, and in a few Days I had a Dige&s;tion at the Edges: I was obliged to leave it to the Care of an Apothecary: But in a &s;hort Time I was &s;ent for again, the Fever being returned, and the Part mortified higher, I u&s;ed the &s;ame Method as before, with the &s;ame Succe&s;s; but all the former Symptoms returned the third Time; but upon repeating the &s;ame Method again, cea&s;ed: I thought it to no Purpo&s;e to take off the Leg, having too often found Returns after it, the Fault being in the Blood and Juices. But Providence now fir&s;t directed me to order the
<PB N="5" REF="6">Bark in this Ca&s;e, whil&s;t there was a Remi&s;&s;ion of the Fever; it an&s;wered beyond what I expected; the Fever no more returned; the Leg was taken off, and I &s;aw the Per&s;on well and lu&s;ty many Years afterwards; and I have &s;ince &s;everal times had the Experience of the good Effects of it in the like Ca&s;e, which has been no &s;mall Satis|faction to me.</P>
<P>I think it as much my Du|ty to make a publick Acknow|ledgement of an Error of my Judgment for very many Years, becau&s;e (others al&s;o of greater Eminency giving the &s;ame Judg|ment) I do verily believe it has been the Occa&s;ion of &s;everal
<PB N="6" REF="7">unfortunate Women, not only to continue in a deplorable State, but al&s;o often to have a mi&s;erable Exit, which by my too late Practice, attended with Succe&s;s, I have now Rea&s;on to believe, might have been pre|vented, if their Brea&s;ts had been taken off in Time. This I think is worthy to be compa&s;&s;ionately con&s;idered by all Surgeons, lea&s;t the too long Omi&s;&s;ion of it, may &s;ome Time become an Un|ea&s;ine&s;s to them, as it now is to me, when I reflect of it. I hope none can put that Con|&s;truction upon this, as if I ex|pected, that in all Degrees of Cancers, taking off the Tumor, would be effectual; for &s;ome are of that Malignancy, even to
<PB N="7" REF="8">&s;o poi&s;onous a Nature, which, if blended with the Blood and Juices, nothing will an&s;wer; but I would not have any too much di&s;couraged by the ill A&s;|pect of them; for two I had Succe&s;s in, appear'd as ill and threatning as mo&s;t I have &s;een; and therefore I would not have taken them off, if the Patients had not earne&s;tly de&s;ired it. I think fit to intimate, that the fewer Medicines have been taken, whil&s;t the Tumor remains on, the better; for any Thing that cau&s;es the lea&s;t Fermentation of the Humours, does the more contaminate, and &s;poil the Blood and Juices.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould think fit to en|courage any Thing of this Na|ture,
<PB N="8" REF="9">in the Way I propo&s;e, or any Way you &s;hall think more proper; I have &s;everal Ob&s;erva|tions to offer to you, which I hope may be of U&s;e:</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to me a very melancho|ly Con&s;ideration, that in a Nation &s;o happy in its Laws and Government, there &s;hould be &s;o little Care taken to prevent the great Misfortunes that are very often brought upon the mi&s;era|ble Subjects, by &s;uffering tho&s;e to practice Surgery (the ancient|e&s;t and certaine&s;t Part of Phy|&s;ick) with Impunity, that are &s;o very ill qualified for it. Tho'
<PB N="10" REF="11">I hope as far as your Power ex|tends, this Mi&s;chief is in a great Mea&s;ure prevented. But for the Sake of the Country-People, &s;o numerous and nece&s;&s;ary a Part of our Fellow-Subjects; it is certainly the Duty of all tho&s;e that are &s;en&s;ible of it, to u&s;e their be&s;t Endeavours to get it put upon a better Regula|tion.</P>
<P>And if you can propo&s;e a Method to do it, if your Char|ter gave you Power &s;ufficient, you can never have a more fa|vourable Opportunity to obtain the Enlargement of it for &s;o good a U&s;e; their pre&s;ent Maje&s;ties having always &s;hewn a humane Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion for all their Sub|jects.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>And if any new Law &s;hould be wanting to compleat &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary a Work; it is not to be doubted, but that a Parlia|ment that has made &s;o great Improvements in the Law, for the Pre&s;ervation of the E&s;tates and Rights of the Subjects; will al&s;o, if it be properly laid before them, take the &s;ame Care for the Pre&s;ervation of the Lives, Limbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the People, in which a particular Provi&s;ion may be made for the Advantage of the Poor of the Pari&s;hes, by ere|cting an Infirmary in the Cen|ter of every County, to receive &s;uch Poor as have Occa&s;ion for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good Sur|geon; and for want of it, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, become Cripples,
<PB N="12" REF="13">and in others, lie long in a lan|guid and mi&s;erable Condition, to the great Expence of the Pari&s;hes.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN your printed Let|ter directed to the Go|vernors of our Company was read in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, before a Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, our Clerk was then order'd to return you our Thanks for the Same, and to de&s;ire you to &s;end us &s;uch other curious Ca&s;es, as you were then plea&s;ed to promi&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to &s;econd your Intention for the
<PB N="13" REF="14">Advancement of Surgery, 'twas order'd, to print four times a Year, the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants Or|der, which you have or will read from Time to Time, in &s;everal of the publick Papers, to encou|rage every Surgeon to follow your laudable Example; all the&s;e Ca|&s;es, together with &s;uch as will be found in the Sea-Surgeons Journals, being entered in a Book, will from Time to Time be peru|&s;ed by the Court of Examiners, and printed at the Company's Expence, as the Gentlemen who &s;end them &s;hall approve: I wi&s;h your other Propo&s;al in the print|ed Letter, for e&s;tabli&s;hing an Ho&s;pital or Infirmary in the &s;e|veral Counties, could take effect, but at pre&s;ent I cannot find out
<PB N="14" REF="15">any Parliament-Men that will undertake &s;o beneficial an Under|taking. I am now to acknow|ledge yours of the <HI>17th</HI> In&s;tant, and to acquaint you, that from your Example I have given the <HI>Bark</HI> in all Mortifications with &s;uch Succe&s;s as has encouraged the Gentlemen you mention to admini&s;ter it. I have now un|der my Care a Gentleman of <HI>78,</HI> who owes his Life to that Medicine; his Ca&s;e was at fir&s;t a Gangreen after a Phlegmon; the u&s;ual Means &s;eem'd to have removed the Danger, but the Fever continuing without Remi&s;|&s;ion or Intermi&s;&s;ion, a Sphacelus &s;oon appeared, which nothing did &s;top the Progre&s;s of till the <HI>Bark</HI> was u&s;ed, and in Twenty four
<PB N="15" REF="16">Hours and le&s;s, the Separation began, with a laudable Pus. The &s;ame thing happen'd to a Jew who&s;e Sphacelus had got ground for three Weeks in &s;pight of all Means, where &s;everal Surgeons were concerned &s;ome Years ago, and to another Patient of mine, I have now u&s;ed it in &s;even Ca&s;es, the Circum&s;tances in each being different, and yet in all the <HI>Bark</HI> has taken Effect: Even within the&s;e few Days to Mr. <HI>Delenor,</HI> who kept the Bagnio in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Street, in whom a Mortification happened, after &s;everal punctures in Drop&s;ical Legs, the <HI>Bark</HI> &s;topt the Progre&s;s in le&s;s than twenty four Hours, and the Sluffs be|gan to &s;eparate, but the Patient having a Jaundice, and &s;pent
<PB N="16" REF="17">with Evacuations, it revived and came into the other Leg, of which tho' he died, yet the Power of the <HI>Bark</HI> was &s;o plain, that from this and the other Ca&s;es, I think it evident that we may be as &s;ure of getting the Better of, or at lea&s;t of &s;topping a Morti|fication, from any internal Cau&s;e, by the <HI>Bark,</HI> as conquering an Ague thereby.</P>
<P>As to the Cure of Cancers by Amputation, there are but few Surgeons here that flatter them|&s;elves of it; of late we recom|mend them to the Drinking about two Quarts a Day of the Wa|ter at the <HI>Dog and Duck</HI> in St. <HI>George</HI>'s Fields, <HI>Southwark,</HI> which I can aver, &s;tops the Pro|gre&s;s of, and likely will get the

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heartily thank you for the Favour of yours, for until now, I had rea&s;on to believe, that our Company &s;lighted my Letter, for your Clerk never wrote any thing to me about it, nor did I hear any thing of it before your kind Letter informed me, for no publick Papers that come into the&s;e Parts (that I ever &s;aw) mention any thing of the good Method, the Company has taken. But if at the &s;ame time, care be
<PB N="19" REF="20">not taken, to get Surgery not to be &s;uffered to be practi&s;ed by any, but tho&s;e that are regularly brought up and &s;ufficiently exa|min'd, the Country People will be the more impo&s;ed upon by Quacks being made (if po&s;&s;ible) more bold and impudent, by put|ting into their Hands what they are not capable of making a good U&s;e of, and Surgeons of Value (who have the Misfortune to live in the Country) will be much injured by it, which I &s;hould be very &s;orry any ways to contribute to. This can't appear &s;o plainly to you, as to tho&s;e that live in the Country, but I doubt not but your Goodne&s;s will have re|gard to it, by &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider|ing it, in order to prevent &s;o
<PB N="20" REF="21">ill a Con&s;equence. I hope I &s;hall not tire your Patience, by giving you an account of a Ca&s;e of a Patient of mine this Spring, who was far gone in a Drop&s;y and A&s;thma, attended with very ma|ny ill Symptoms, which daily increa&s;ed, though he had a very good Phy&s;ician (Dr. <HI>Freeman</HI>) who made u&s;e of all proper in|ternal Means, but they not an|&s;wering I was con&s;ulted; his Legs and Thighs were grown to a very great Bulk, and did appear to me (and al&s;o to the Doctor) as if they would &s;oon mortify; I told the Doctor I had never found that Punctures would be &s;ufficient to relieve in &s;o dangerous a Ca&s;e, but I was of Opinion that nothing but ma|king
<PB N="21" REF="22">many large Inci&s;ions into the Legs could be of U&s;e, tho' I was unwilling to begin &s;uch a Work; but in a few Days we plainly &s;aw that he could not continue long, if not &s;oon reliev'd; the Doctor encouraging me, I was re&s;olved to venture my Re|putation, rather than the Patient &s;hould be lo&s;t, tho' I knew the cen&s;orious Age, did not &s;pare to reflect on Surgeons, when they u&s;ed any new Method without Succe&s;s; but I can with Plea&s;ure tell you, that the Patient was &s;oon reliev'd by it, and by often u&s;ing Fomentations, and as often changing the Catapla&s;ms, I not only pre&s;erv'd the Tone of the Parts, but al&s;o con&s;tantly di&s;|charged va&s;t Quantities of the
<PB N="22" REF="23">watry Humour for more than two Months, until it was all carried off, from all Parts of the Body; and the Legs have recovered their true Tone, and are as &s;mall as they were before he was ill, and do not &s;o much as &s;well at Night, tho' he daily goes about his Bu&s;ine&s;s performing it with chearfulne&s;s, and is better in every re&s;pect than he has been for many Years.</P>
<P>I am very glad to hear, that you have had &s;o many demon|&s;trations of the good Effect of the <HI>Bark,</HI> tho' certainly a great deal ought to be imputed to your good and proper directing of it: I beg leave ju&s;t to mention, that leaving off the <HI>Bark</HI> too &s;oon, a Patient of mine had a Return
<PB N="23" REF="24">of the Mortification, in about five Days time, but &s;carifying and repeating it, I pre&s;ently had the good Effect of it again, and &s;he is now perfectly recover'd; and tho' &s;he had a very ill Habit of Body before, is now better than &s;he has been for &s;everal Years, and her Looks &s;hew it to all that knew her before, tho' &s;he is fifty Years of Age.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear of any thing that gives Relief in Cancers; but if the Tumor be not perfectly reduced by it, I fear no Cure will continue, unle&s;s the Tumor be fir&s;t removed; but I &s;hall wave this, until I have the Happine&s;s to &s;ee you, which I hope to do at the beginning of the next Se&s;|&s;ions of Parliament; for I am
<PB N="24" REF="25">very de&s;irous to gain the Point of having Infirmaries, and tho' my Intere&s;t be but &s;mall, yet join'd with yours and others that I hope we &s;hall meet with, I do not de&s;|pair; and I flatter my &s;elf that you will excu&s;e the length of this from,</P>

<P>WHereas in a Po&s;t&s;cript to a Letter to the <HI>Surgeons Company</HI> (Oct. 18, 1731.) men|tion is made of the erecting of an Infirmary in the Center of every County, for the Reception of &s;uch Poor as &s;hall have Oc|ca&s;ion for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good Surgeon, and for want of it, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, become Crip|ples, and in others, lie long in a languid and mi&s;erable Condi|tion, to the no &s;mall Expence of the Pari&s;hes: This De&s;ign the Propo&s;er thinks him&s;elf par|ticularly obliged (and by Judg|ment and Inclination is led) to

<PB N="27" REF="28">the following Adverti&s;e|ment was put into the <HI>Gazette, Nov.</HI> 20, 1731. viz.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABout two Months ago, I was &s;ent for to a Gentleman about 50 Years of Age, who had a Mortification on the back of his Foot, from an internal Cau&s;e.
<PB N="31" REF="32">Upon &s;ight of it, I &s;carified it and dre&s;s'd it up, <HI>S. A.</HI> and his Phy&s;icians ordered him the <HI>Conf. Raleigh. Rad. Serpt. Ther. V.</HI> &amp;c. of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Medicines. Next Day Mr. Serjeant <HI>Dickins</HI> and Mr. <HI>Che&s;&s;elden</HI> were con&s;ulted, and they confirmed what we had done, and de&s;ir'd us to go on, which we did to no manner of Purpo&s;e, for eight Days, for the Mortification encrea&s;ed, and the Fever did not abate, upon which we had another Con&s;ulation, in which we agreed, that in all pro|bability he would not hold out 24 Hours longer: Then Mr. <HI>Dic|kins</HI> propos'd the <HI>Bark,</HI> not upon his own Experience, but upon your Authority, and Mr. Serjeant <HI>Amyand</HI> (who had al&s;o made &s;e|veral
<PB N="32" REF="33">&s;ucce&s;sful Experiments with it) which was with &s;ome Diffi|culty agreed to. Upon taking the <HI>Bark</HI> the Fever &s;oon left him, the Mortification &s;topt, the Wound dige&s;ted, and the Sloughs ca&s;t off, to the great Surprize of every one that ever &s;aw or heard of it. I think this new U&s;e of the <HI>Bark</HI> (for which we are more oblig'd to you, than to him who fir&s;t &s;hewed the U&s;e of it in In|termitting Fevers) is of too much Con&s;equence, not to be commu|nicated to the Fraternity; there|fore I beg the Favour of you to fend me a farther Account of the &s;end me a farther Account of the Experience you have had of the U&s;e of the <HI>Bark</HI> in Mortifica|tions, than you gave in your printed Letter to our Company,

<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Your mo&s;t obedient humble Servant,</HI> Jo. Douglas.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>As this gives me Rea&s;on to de&s;ire the Surgeons Company farther to take my Letter into Con&s;ideration; &s;o I take this Opportunity once again, to de|&s;ire the Gentlemen of <HI>England,</HI> to con&s;ider what I before propo|&s;ed, (in an Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>Gazette, Nov.</HI> 20, 1731.) for erecting an Infirmary in every
<PB N="34" REF="35">County; for I &s;hall be very &s;orry if I mu&s;t own, (excepting <HI>Lon|don</HI>) in this Kingdom there does not appear, that generous Re|gard to the Health, and Life of Man, as in &s;everal Foreign Parts; and if their Charitable Care of the poor Sick and Maimed, be an Effect of their Religion. I blu&s;h to think, that we (who call our &s;elves the Reform'd) &s;hould come &s;o far &s;hort of them in this great Chri&s;tian Duty: And as the Gentlemen of this County, did not think fit to take any Notice of what I propo&s;ed to them, I &s;hall be very ready to &s;ub&s;cribe fifty Pounds, if an Infirmary be erected in any neighbouring County, that the Poor may not &s;uffer for Want of Advice and
<PB N="35" REF="36">Medicines, as the Rich often do, by having too much.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that I intimate to all Surgeons, what I have mention'd to our Company (in a Letter the 17th of this Month) that I would not be under&s;tood by my printed Letter, as if the <HI>Bark</HI> would an&s;wer in Mortifica|tions from all internal Cau&s;es, for in &s;ome it is not proper, as Sur|geons may ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And that the A&s;per&s;ion of the Adage of <HI>Tres; Duo;</HI> may not be ca&s;t upon Surgeons, as it is upon the Practicers of the other Branch of Phy&s;ick: I &s;hall con|clude with heartily wi&s;hing, that we may endeavour to prove our &s;elves Chri&s;tians, by being kind|ly
<PB N="36" REF="37">affectioned one towards an|other, and al&s;o publick Spirit|ed; not &s;eeking meerly our own Things, but every one al&s;o the Things of others, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Com|mon Good.</P>
<P>Having within the&s;e few Days met with an Account formerly given (by an ingenious Phy&s;ician in his Time) of great Cures (in Surgery) done by Mineral Wa|ters; (it has given me great Sa|tisfaction, in hopes that the Water at the <HI>Dog</HI> and <HI>Duck</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> mentioned in the Letter of our worthy Ma&s;ter, Mr. Serjeant <HI>Amyand,</HI> may prove of great U&s;e in Cancers) among many rational Thoughts how this is performed, he takes no|tice,
<PB N="37" REF="38">That as the Juice of deli|cious Fruit, plays upon the Or|gans of Ta&s;t, &s;o doth the right Healing Waters upon the Ulcers: at fir&s;t touch, it &s;eems to tear the Fle&s;h off deeper, but im|mediately changes the beginning of deep Pain into a deeper Plea|&s;ure; and after many A&s;&s;aults and quick Slidings, the Rugo&s;i|ties of the Wounds, or of the Liquor, or of both, are by their dancing Vibrations &s;mooth'd into a delightful Accord; and we may perceive, how &s;ome Waters, may by their rolling Particles, be the greate&s;t Probes, and yet the &s;ure&s;t Searchers, Clean&s;ers, and Healers. And hence al&s;o on the contrary, we may &s;ee, how &s;ome Waters, which cure Ulcers
<PB N="38" REF="39">and Cancers by outward Appli|cation, may be too bu&s;ily corro|&s;ive and dangerous, if taken inwardly.</P>
<P>He mentions &s;everal of the old <HI>Holy-wells,</HI> &s;o call'd; one he &s;ays he can affirm upon his own knowledge, has done many Cures, upon putrid and faetid Ulcers, which were many Years deplored for incurable, he had &s;een it tried often, and always to good effect, &s;ometimes con|&s;iderably wonderful; it is &s;ome|what a&s;perous, but plea&s;ing to malignant Ulcers.</P>
<P>Now I fear the Monks and Prie&s;ts making an ill U&s;e of the&s;e Wells, by pretending they had their &s;anative Vertues given to them by their Saints, and by lea|ding
<PB N="39" REF="40">the People to Super&s;tition thereby, has been a great Means to bring them out of Credit, by which many mi&s;erable Peo|ple may have been deprived of the great Benefit they might have received by them; and therefore it may be nece&s;&s;ary at this time to take them again into con&s;i|deration, by comparing &s;ome of the Waters, of the old <HI>Holy-wells,</HI> with tho&s;e at the <HI>Dog</HI> and <HI>Duck;</HI> and al&s;o that they may with di|ligent and &s;trict Ob&s;ervation (by &s;ome neighbouring Surgeon) be tried upon Cancers; that no Care may be wanting to promote &s;o great and good a Work, as the Cure of Cancers.</P>
