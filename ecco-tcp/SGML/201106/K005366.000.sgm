<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the reque&s;t which you urged in &s;o obliging a manner, I am now to pre&s;ent you with a few re|marks on the nature, cau&s;es, and method of cure, of Nervous Di&s;orders. Under this denomination, in its full extent, are included &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es of the mo&s;t dan|gerous kind; as the apoplexy, epilep&s;y, and convul&s;ions, be&s;ide the hy&s;teric pa&s;|&s;ion and hypochondriacal di&s;ea&s;e. The enquiry, however, &s;hall be re&s;tricted to tho&s;e complaints more particularly deno|minated nervous, and which &s;eem to de|pend
<PB N="2" REF="3">upon extreme &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;ti|tution. But the nerves being the ba&s;is of our &s;ubject, it may be proper to pre|mi&s;e a few words on tho&s;e delicate parts of the human frame, univer&s;ally admit|ted to be the medium of intercour&s;e to the body and &s;oul.</P>
<P>The nerves are minute ramifications, re&s;embling chords; proceeding either from the brain or the &s;pinal marrow, and di&s;|tributed to the various parts of the body, for the purpo&s;es of &s;en&s;ation and motion. With regard to their &s;tructure anatomi&s;ts are divided; &s;ome holding them exqui|&s;itely fine tubes; others, filaments with|out any cavity. The former hypothe&s;is, countenanced alike by experiment and analogy, is con&s;equently far the more probable. Tho&s;e who maintain the tubu|lar formation, conclude that the nerves are furni&s;hed with a fluid &s;ecreted in the brain, and known by the name of animal &s;pirits.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>Nervous complaints are &s;o various and eccentric, that a volume would hardly &s;uffice to a complete de&s;cription of them. The mo&s;t common &s;ymptoms are, weak|ne&s;s, flatulence, palpitations, watchful|ne&s;s, &s;leepine&s;s after eating, timidity, fla&s;hes of heat and cold, numbne&s;s, ri|gors of different parts, vertigo, pains, e&s;pecially of the head, back, and loins, hiccup, difficulty of re&s;piration and de|glutition, anxiety, dry cough, limpid urine, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An opinion prevails that nervous di&s;|orders are more frequent in this country at pre&s;ent, than in any former period. This is commonly imputed to the drink|ing of tea, now &s;o general among people of all ranks. Whether this celebrated exotic really proves &s;o injurious as has been imagined, may &s;till be matter of di&s;pute. That in many con&s;titutions it excites nervous &s;ymptoms, &s;uch as tre|mors, palpitations, and watchfulne&s;s, we
<PB N="4" REF="5">are certain from experience; but we al&s;o know that in others it is regularly taken, not only without any &s;en&s;ible bad effects, but even with advantage. It relieves a headake, di&s;pels drow&s;ine&s;s, and is often ob&s;erved to promote dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Should we examine the whole econo|my of per&s;ons mo&s;t addicted to tea-drink|ing, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e who are imagined to be chiefly affected by it, perhaps we might di&s;cover other probable cau&s;es of weakne&s;s. The numerous modes of in|dulgence practi&s;ed in times of refinement and luxury, ought all to be allowed their re&s;pective &s;hare in producing this effect. The farther we depart from &s;implicity and temperance in diet, and the more we &s;acrifice the whole&s;ome exerci&s;es to the inactivity attending dome&s;tic amu&s;e|ments, the greater will be the influence of every phy&s;ical error in dimini&s;hing the vigor of the con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>When we con&s;ider that tho&s;e cau&s;es have more or le&s;s operated, at &s;ome pe|riod or other, in every country where re|finement has any time exi&s;ted; and when we take into the account the numerous cau&s;es of weakne&s;s which have ari&s;en from accident or di&s;ea&s;e, there might &s;eem rea&s;on for concluding, that in the &s;pace of &s;ome thou&s;and years, the con&s;titution of man has undergone an extraordinary change. But &s;uch an opinion, however plau&s;ible, is much to be que&s;tioned. On a &s;ubject of this nature we can draw no argument from experience. The vigor of one age has declined, before that of another has arrived at maturity; and no &s;tandard is tran&s;mitted, by which we may determine the comparative &s;trength of ge|nerations. Perhaps it will be &s;aid, that this point has long been &s;ettled by the poets.</P>

<P>Had the human race degenerated, &s;ince the Augu&s;tan age, in the &s;ame progre&s;|&s;ion, to what a degree of weakne&s;s mu&s;t mankind have by this time dwindled!</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P>If the problem were determinable by facts, it would be &s;o by in&s;tances of lon|gevity; but even tho&s;e are far from being deci&s;ive. There is rea&s;on to doubt whe|ther longevity be a certain criterion of uncommon vigor. Perhaps it may be a&s;cribed rather to &s;oundne&s;s of con&s;titu|tion than to &s;uperior &s;trength. Admitting the poetic authorities in favor of the primitive ages; admitting the extraordi|nary mu&s;cular force of a Hector, a Tur|nus, or a Hercules; &s;till the vigor of tho&s;e heroes can reflect no general lu&s;tre on the times in which they lived; nay their fame implies a great inferiority of the contemporary inhabitants of the world.</P>
<P>But to di&s;pute with former ages the palm of con&s;titutional vigor, is not the object of enquiry. The &s;peculation could only be &s;o far u&s;eful as it might enable us to a&s;certain what circum&s;tances in the modern way of living appear the mo&s;t &s;ubver&s;ive of corporeal &s;trength. The
<PB N="8" REF="9">di&s;tinctions characteri&s;tic of fa&s;hionable life are idlene&s;s and intemperance; the never-failing concomitants of high re|finement. Cel&s;us ob&s;erves that tho&s;e two vices had fir&s;t &s;poiled the con&s;titution of the Greeks, and afterwards of his coun|trymen the Romans, when they had be|come ma&s;ters of the luxury, as well as the territories, of that polite people. In &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the &s;ame cau&s;es have &s;imilarly operated; and their united in|fluence may, independently of any parti|cular &s;pecies of modern luxury, continue to produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally admitted, that the pre|di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of nervous di&s;orders is too great irritability of con&s;titution, which may be either hereditary, or acquired in various ways; for in&s;tance, by a &s;eden|tary life, too great application to &s;tudy, intemperance of any kind, tedious di&s;|ea&s;es, profu&s;e evacuations, or the depre&s;&s;|ing pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<P>Nervous di&s;tempers are alike incidental to both &s;exes; with only this difference, that in the female, from the natural de|licacy of con&s;titution, and the manner of life, they are, in general, more frequent and violent than in the other. Being pe|culiar to neither &s;ex, they are not re&s;trict|ed to any period of life; but u&s;ually mo&s;t prevalent during the middle &s;tages of it.</P>
<P>Though a weakne&s;s of the nervous &s;y&s;tem be often hereditary, it &s;eldom re|ceives any augmentation in the earlier part of life; the playfulne&s;s of children, and their exemption from cares, at lea&s;t from &s;uch as are productive of habitual anxiety, counteracting the progre&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition. The &s;ame cau&s;es may con|tinue to operate after the commencement of adult age, unle&s;s men&s;trual irregulari|ties in one &s;ex, or pernicious exce&s;&s;es in the other, call forth the latent &s;eeds of con&s;titutional debility.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P>At whatever period the di&s;order fir&s;t appears, its progre&s;s in different per&s;ons is liable to great variation. In &s;ome it remains a &s;tationary complaint, with in|termi&s;&s;ions, however, but without exacer|bations, for &s;everal years; while in others it fluctuates through all the gradations, from the fainte&s;t &s;ymptom of &s;pa&s;modic affection, to its con&s;ummation in the epi|lep&s;y, apoplexy, or hy&s;teric pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When but one cau&s;e &s;timulates nervous affection, the health may not be greatly impaired for a time: but when two or more operate in conjunction; for in|&s;tance, when to a &s;edentary life is joined the influence of grief or anxiety; and when watchfulne&s;s, the natural concomi|tant of each, is rendered more ob&s;tinate by the combination of all; the &s;trength mu&s;t fa&s;t decline, and the di&s;ea&s;e advance with proportionable rapidity.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>An eminent author has ob&s;erved, that there is &s;carce a di&s;ea&s;e which the ner|vous ailment will not counterfeit: he might have added, that there is hardly any which it may not realize. The debilitat|ed &s;tate of the concoctive powers, and the general con&s;equent relaxation, are par|ticularly favorable to the production of chronic di&s;orders; while the irritability of the nervous &s;y&s;tem no le&s;s di&s;po&s;es to tho&s;e of the acute kind.</P>
<P>When a weakne&s;s of the nerves is he|reditary, the origin of their di&s;ea&s;es is lo&s;t in the general debility of the &s;y&s;tem: but if it has been acquired by errors in what are called the non-naturals, the be|ginning of tho&s;e complaints may, for the mo&s;t part, be traced to a weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach and bowels; whence if tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es do not actually derive their earlie&s;t exi&s;tence, at lea&s;t the &s;igns of their inva|&s;ion are there mo&s;t perceptible. They commonly begin with an oppre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="12" REF="13">and &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s in the &s;tomach after eating: the &s;leep is much interrupted with dreams: frequently the per&s;on feels a &s;light pain in the &s;tomach or belly. Tho&s;e &s;ymptoms are at times accompanied with a &s;inging in the ears, and with fits of gid|dine&s;s, particularly in &s;tooping.</P>
<P>That a di&s;ea&s;e which depends upon ir|ritability, and is &s;upported by a &s;ympathy in the nervous &s;y&s;tem, derives its origin from the &s;tomach and bowels, is an opi|nion &s;trongly confirmed by the texture and offices of tho&s;e parts. Furni&s;hed with numerous branches of nerves, they are ex|tremely &s;u&s;ceptible of irritation; to which they are al&s;o particularly expo&s;ed from the weight or re&s;i&s;tance of the food, its occa|&s;ional acrimony, and the &s;timulating na|ture of the ga&s;tric fluids, rendered yet more acrimonious by vitiated dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the di&s;order, be|fore the patient has either been cautioned
<PB N="13" REF="14">by the phy&s;ician, or in&s;tructed by experi|ence, to ab&s;tain from a hearty &s;upper, it is not uncommon for this indulgence to be &s;ucceeded, in the night, by a great op|pre&s;&s;ion about the heart and &s;tomach. This &s;tate is frequently accompanied with a convul&s;ive motion of the tongue and jaws; during which the former lolls out, and is expo&s;ed to the gna&s;hing of the teeth.</P>
<P>When a great weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach and bowels has been introduced, many are the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of irritation from which nervous &s;ymptoms may en&s;ue. In general, whatever, by quantity or qua|lity, relaxes the &s;olids, or by acrimony &s;timulates into &s;pa&s;ms; whatever dimi|ni&s;hes the energy, or excites to irregu|lar motion, of the animal &s;pirits, tends either immediately or remotely to the pro|duction of nervous di&s;orders.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
<P>The occa&s;ional cau&s;es may be divided into the following cla&s;&s;es: 1. Wind, phlegm, worms, or acrid matter, in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. 2. Acrid matter in the blood. 3. The diminution or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome accu&s;tomed di&s;charge. 4. Inani|tion, whether occa&s;ioned by ab&s;tinence or evacuation. 5. Violent pa&s;&s;ions. 6. Ob|&s;tructions in the abdominal vi&s;cera. 7. The effluvia of &s;ome odorous &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Though tho&s;e cau&s;es may operate &s;ing|ly towards the production of nervous &s;ymptoms, it is not uncommon for two or more of them to act at the &s;ame time, and when this happens, the di&s;order which they excite in the animal economy, as has been already ob&s;erved, is propor|tionably violent.</P>
<P>Of all the cau&s;es of nervous complaints, none is more pernicious than profu&s;e &s;e|minal evacuation. It has been alledged that this di&s;charge always accompanies a
<PB N="15" REF="16">chronic weakne&s;s: the remark is per|haps not &s;ufficiently confirmed by autho|rities. When &s;uch a ca&s;e occurs, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;eminal weakne&s;s had preceded the nervous di&s;|order. On the appearance of the latter, however, the former is liable to be in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In attempting the removal of the nerv|ous complaint, the greate&s;t attention is nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the preci&s;e origin, whether &s;ingular or plural, whence it de|rives its &s;upport: for without &s;uch know|ledge, in vain &s;hall we endeavor to pre|vent the effects of irritation. With every advantage on our &s;ide, we &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to regret the ob&s;tinacy of the di&s;|ea&s;e. Indeed, that nervous di&s;orders &s;hould prove difficult of cure, will not appear &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con&s;ider how much they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a variety of oppo&s;ite indications and circum&s;tances,
<PB N="16" REF="17">of a po&s;itive and negative, of a phy&s;ical and moral kind. Amid&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of nouri&s;hment, is every impediment to di|ge&s;tion. The impurity of the blood we find aggravated by great irregularity of the di&s;charges. Sleep, however indi&s;pen&s;|able for recruiting the exhau&s;ted &s;trength, in many ca&s;es comes not &s;pontaneou&s;ly; nor can it be procured by medicine, with|out increa&s;ing relaxation. Exerci&s;e, ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, is often prevented by a li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, utterly aver&s;e to motion. In morbid irritability, which requires the mo&s;t &s;oothing treatment, the patient is peculiarly liable to perturbations of body and mind. Notwith&s;tanding incidental or habitual lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, which &s;eems to indicate the expedience of &s;ome exhilarating liquor, even the moderate u&s;e of cordials may be neither effectual nor &s;afe. Anxiety, natural to the com|plaint, and increa&s;ed by every con&s;idera|tion, mu&s;t yet be &s;upported with patience.
<PB N="17" REF="18">And la&s;tly, though &s;o complicated a di&s;|temper might &s;eem to demand the mo&s;t active remedies, it is often ob&s;erved to be aggravated even by tho&s;e of the gent|le&s;t kind.</P>
<P>It may well be imagined, that a di&s;|ea&s;e which for the mo&s;t part originates from an irritability of the alimentary ca|nal, or is always accompanied with it, requires particular attention to diet. In no other chronic di&s;order is a dietetic re|&s;triction equally indi&s;pen&s;able: for the per&s;on who would either &s;top the com|plaint, or obtain a recovery, mu&s;t be not only temperate, but circum&s;pect, in all convivial gratifications. The infinite di|ver&s;ity of temperaments renders it im|po&s;&s;ible to deliver rules accommodated to every individual; but in general, the re|gimen of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to ner|vous complaints may be compri&s;ed under the following directions. &mdash; The food ought to be ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and chief|ly
<PB N="18" REF="19" MS="y">of the animal kind: vegetables, on account of the flatulence they occa&s;ion, being commonly hurtful. Pa&s;try-work, and butter-&s;auces, are prejudicial; as are likewi&s;e fat meats. Even bread &s;hould be eaten &s;paringly, and never on the day that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is baked: for, if new, it occa&s;ions a great fermentation in the &s;tomach. Wine, for the mo&s;t part, cau&s;es di&s;tur|bance, if not in the &s;tomach, at lea&s;t in the bowels of the valetudinary. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of malt-li|quors: but to &s;ome con&s;titutions porter, in the quantity of half a pint, or not ex|ceeding a pint, is often found &s;alutary. For the majority, however, of the nerv|ous, water, either alone, or mixt with a &s;mall portion of brandy, which is lighter on the &s;tomach than rum, is the be&s;t adapted drink. Whatever kind is u&s;ed, dilution &s;hould always be moderate. Sup|per ought either to be omitted, or taken in a very &s;paring quantity, and at an ear|ly hour.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="20" MS="y">
<P>This attention is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as errors committed in diet never fail to affect the nightly re&s;t; a con&s;ideration of the greate&s;t importance. For, though di|ge&s;tion may have hitherto proceeded with|out much unea&s;ine&s;s, yet when its pro|gre&s;s is retarded by a recumbent po&s;ture, which al&s;o greatly impedes the di&s;charge of flatulence from the &s;tomach; when the aliments, by retention in the bowels, have acquired a more con&s;iderable degree of acrimony; and when the body, by the relaxing warmth of the bed, is rendered more &s;u&s;ceptible of irritation, &s;leep, if not entirely prevented, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, is at lea&s;t &s;o much interrupted as hardly to afford any refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Previous to an account of the cure of nervous di&s;orders, it cannot be improper to make a few remarks on the method by which it has hitherto been u&s;ually con|ducted. We know too little of the phy|&s;iology of the nerves, to be intimately ac|quainted
<PB N="20" REF="21">with the nature and modifica|tions of their di&s;ea&s;es. Our theory is conjectural; and our practice, if not founded on principles too vague, is fre|quently indi&s;criminate. Among the oc|ca&s;ional cau&s;es mentioned above, only a few may be &s;afely oppo&s;ed by an imme|diate recour&s;e to a&s;tringent and &s;trength|ening remedies: yet too often has this method been pur&s;ued under different cir|cum&s;tances of the complaint. Of this prepo&s;terous practice not the only ill con|&s;equence is the fruitle&s;s admini&s;traction of corroborants: for the proce&s;s of cure be|ing commenced where it ought to have ended, the requi&s;ite preparation is neglect|ed, and a foundation laid for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When nervous di&s;orders ari&s;e from in|anition, or from the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome accu&s;tomed di&s;charge, their origin may be a&s;certained from either of tho&s;e cau&s;es. If they proceed from the latter, the eva|cuation
<PB N="21" REF="22">ought to be recalled; if from the former, ha&s;ty repletion mu&s;t be avoided. Without this caution the dige&s;tive powers will be oppre&s;&s;ed, and a load of impure humours will be generated; which, by farther weakening the body, contaminat|ing the blood, and hazarding ob&s;tructions in the bowels, will not only increa&s;e the original, but may give ri&s;e to two other principal cau&s;es of the complaint.</P>
<P>If the weakne&s;s productive of nervous di&s;tre&s;s be owing to any &s;udden and great evacuation, recour&s;e &s;hould immediately be had to &s;trengthening remedies: but in all ca&s;es, except the above, preparation is nece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;tomach being either primarily or &s;econdarily affected, the treatment might do well to begin with a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha or camomile flowers. The next indication is a laxa|tive, to be repeated occa&s;ionally through the cour&s;e of the complaint, when the patient is &s;ubject to co&s;tivene&s;s; a &s;tate
<PB N="22" REF="23">that generally accompanies nervous di&s;|orders, and always tends to increa&s;e them. In different ca&s;es different laxatives are proper. When bilious humours cau&s;e ir|ritation, rhubarb may prove mo&s;t &s;uit|able; but if acid humours, as often, pre|dominate, a tea-&s;poonful or two of mag|ne&s;ia may be given, either alone, or mix|ed with a few grains of the former. All rough and violent purges are to be avoided, as they increa&s;e at once irritation and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>After di&s;charging from the &s;tomach and bowels any acrid humours which may have occa&s;ioned irritation, pre&s;cription &s;hould be adapted to the particular cau&s;e, or cau&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ed to produce or promote the di&s;ea&s;e. Thus, if there &s;hould be rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect worms, anthelmintic me|dicines mu&s;t be given. But when ob|&s;tructions in the abdominal vi&s;cera appear the cau&s;e of the di&s;order, recour&s;e is to be had (after blooding, if the patient be

It is difficult, indeed, to a&s;certain &s;uch ob|&s;tructions, unle&s;s, what &s;eldom happens, the tumors be perceptible to the touch. But if the &s;igns of weak dige&s;tion be at|tended with fixt pains in the belly, and a quick pul&s;e, without much heat or thir&s;t, the exi&s;tence of this cau&s;e may be pre|&s;umed.</P>
<P>Of all the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of nervous complaints, wind in the &s;tomach or bowels is the mo&s;t frequent, and that which uni|ver&s;ally excites the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms. For di&s;pelling it the u&s;ual recour&s;e is carminatives: but, unle&s;s the wind be in the &s;tomach, tho&s;e &s;el|dom afford immediate relief; &s;ometimes they even aggravate the complaint. A more certain remedy is a tea-&s;poonful of the &s;piritus aethereus, diluted with two table-&s;poonfuls of water. For the &s;ame
<PB N="24" REF="25">end, nothing is more efficacious than opi|um, pre&s;cribed with a&s;&s;a foetida; which proves equally &s;ucce&s;sful, whether the fla|tulence be in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines. In nervous di&s;orders, however, opiates are never to be given without great re|&s;erve, as they impair the &s;trength, and increa&s;e the depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, &s;o com|mon in tho&s;e ca&s;es. A gla&s;s of cold wa|ter, by contracting the mu&s;cular coat of the &s;tomach, will &s;ometimes immediately operate the di&s;charge of flatulence. But &s;hould this &s;imple expedient prove inef|fectual, it mu&s;t not again be attempted.</P>
<P>In oppre&s;&s;ion from the above cau&s;e, ex|ternal applications may al&s;o be &s;ucce&s;sful. Much benefit has been received from rub|bing, at bed-time, upon the &s;tomach and bel|ly, &s;ome of Bate's anodyne bal&s;am, mixt with half its quantity of the expre&s;&s;ed oil of mace, and a fourth part of the oil of mint. An antihy&s;teric pla&s;ter may like|wi&s;e be employed with advantage.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="26">
<P>It is advi&s;able for per&s;ons troubled with flatulence to rub the belly a little, in a circular direction, in the morning, before getting up. For this purpo&s;e the hand were preferable to the fle&s;h-bru&s;h, did it not expo&s;e the joints of the fingers to &s;welling: a con&s;equence to which nerv|ous patients are peculiarly liable, and when it does take place, the pain is often in&s;tantaneou&s;ly exa&s;perated, on taking the &s;malle&s;t quantity of wine, or any &s;trong liquor.</P>
<P>In flatulent complaints of the &s;to|mach and bowels, to rub the legs fre|quently with a fle&s;h-bru&s;h has been found of good effect; which &s;eems to be produced by exciting agreeable o&s;cillations. This exerci&s;e, however, ought not to be continued above a few minutes at a time; otherwi&s;e it is apt to occa&s;ion languor, and increa&s;e irritabi|lity.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="27">
<P>A &s;ymptom not uncommon with nerv|ous per&s;ons is a coldne&s;s of the extremi|ties, particularly the feet. To this they are chiefly expo&s;ed in the winter, when they &s;it by a bad fire, and fix their atten|tion on any object. In &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;hould they venture to bed, the con&s;e|quence is almo&s;t certain that they will continue awake, until by &s;ome means or other the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation be removed. The be&s;t expedient is to chafe the feet with warm bricks, or any application cal|culated to an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For the nervous pain in the &s;mall of the back, &s;ometimes &s;o acute that the patient can hardly &s;tand upright, it is advi&s;able to fold round the body a napkin, which has either been warmed at the fire, or, what is better, likewi&s;e impregnated with the &s;teams of myrrh, benzoin, and frank|incen&s;e, burnt on a &s;hovel. In many ca&s;es, this application gives almo&s;t in&s;tant relief.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="28">
<P>The immediate cau&s;e of nervous di&s;or|ders appearing to be either a deficiency, or irregular motion, of the animal &s;pirits, the mo&s;t efficacious might &s;eem to be &s;uch medicines as exert the &s;peedie&s;t influence on the nervous &s;y&s;tem. For whatever warms the &s;tomach, and excites in it an agreeable &s;en&s;ation, affords a temporary relief. This remark may be thought to &s;ugge&s;t the di&s;crete u&s;e of cordials; which, doubtle&s;s, in &s;ome ca&s;es, may have their propriety. Several rea&s;ons concur, how|ever, to pre&s;cribe with great moderation, where not entirely to prohibit the recour&s;e to tho&s;e remedies, whether of the vinous or of the &s;pirituous kind. The former, by the fermentation they undergo in the &s;tomach and bowels, are apt, as before ob&s;erved, to create di&s;turbance in nervous habits; and the latter, it is well known, have an injurious effect on the vi&s;cera. But when wine does not di&s;agree with the patient, and when &s;pirituous liquors are &s;ufficient|ly diluted, it would be hard, in ca&s;es &s;o
<PB N="28" REF="29">entitled to &s;ympathy, to prohibit any pru|dent gratification.</P>
<P>In this di&s;ea&s;e, the be&s;t cordials are tho&s;e that have no immediate tendency to exhilarate, in the manner of intoxicating liquors; but &s;uch as rather allay than ex|cite an irregular motion of the &s;pirits, and enliven only by removing the ob&s;tacles to their placid and equable exertion. For medicines to accompli&s;h this important purpo&s;e, have the various departments of nature been ran&s;acked. Long and whim|&s;ical was the pre&s;cription of animal &s;ub|&s;tances, and many the fruitle&s;s re&s;earches among the mineral tribes; until modern practice learned to place its dependence on the &s;imples of the vegetable kingdom, and principally on tho&s;e of the fetid cla&s;s. Happy recour&s;e, were its efficacy equally e&s;tabli&s;hed, and it&s;elf directed by more determinate rules. With the common method of admini&s;tering tho&s;e remedies, however, &s;mall is the rea&s;on to be &s;ati&s;|fied. Frequent is the practice to give
<PB N="29" REF="30">them at &s;tated times, without con&s;idering whether they be duly indicated. The con&s;equence of &s;uch repetition is, that they gradually lo&s;e their &s;edative and anti|&s;pa&s;modic power; an inconvenience again&s;t which we cannot be too guarded, in the treatment of &s;o tedious a di&s;ea&s;e; where palliative remedies, though u&s;ed only when requi&s;ite, by habit become nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;titution. Cautiou&s;ly are we, therefore, to re&s;erve them for the more urgent &s;ymptoms; for languors, faint|ings, oppre&s;&s;ion from flatulence, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fetid medicines, taken at bed-time, by a&s;&s;uaging nervous agitations, favor a di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;leep. But they will be taken to no purpo&s;e, and may even increa&s;e perturbation, if the patient retire prema|turely to bed, while the ga&s;tric, or abdo|minal region is di&s;tended with flatulence. On tho&s;e occa&s;ions, it is of great advan|tage to promote the di&s;charge of wind from the &s;tomach, by gentle pre&s;&s;ure with
<PB N="30" REF="31">the hand; which method &s;hould al&s;o be practi&s;ed &s;itting up in bed, if unea&s;ine&s;s, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, be felt in a recum|bent po&s;ture.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting the radical cure of ner|vous complaints, the mo&s;t efficacious re|medies are &s;teel, the Peruvian bark, and the cold-bath. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the two fir&s;t may with propriety be combined; in others, one of them only can be admini&s;|tered with advantage. When the pul&s;e is &s;low, either may be given; if frequent, unle&s;s this &s;ymptom be occa&s;ioned by weakne&s;s, &s;teel e&s;pecially is unadvi&s;able. It ought, however, to be remarked, that in tho&s;e di&s;orders, the pul&s;e is &s;ubject to great irregularity; and therefore, that no po&s;itive indication &s;hould be drawn from it, without the concurrence of other cir|cum&s;tances. Both &s;teel and bark are im|proper while the patient is plethoric, or afflicted with fixt pains in the belly. Cha|lybeate waters are indicated in the &s;ame
<PB N="31" REF="32">circum&s;tances with &s;teel medicines, and may be found alike beneficial.</P>
<P>By nothing is the body more effectual|ly &s;trengthened than by the cold-bath, which &s;hould, therefore, never be neglect|ed, when no particular circum&s;tance for|bids. To bathe three or four times a|week, is &s;ufficient; and at the end of every three months the practice ought to be intermitted, for a week or ten days; a caution al&s;o to be adopted with regard to the &s;trengthening medicines.</P>
<P>The method of u&s;ing the cold-bath in &s;ummer and autumn, and the internal cor|roborants in the winter and &s;pring, is li|able to exception. For the former, by far the more efficacious, is by this means too long interrupted, and in the &s;ea&s;ons when, if the bath be of fre&s;h water, its influence is &s;en&s;ibly greater. A more ad|vi&s;able method is to u&s;e the bath, with the bark and chalybeates, in &s;horter alterna|tions;
<PB N="32" REF="33">bathing two or three weeks, and then taking the medicines half that time. Nay, there lies no objection again&s;t the u&s;e of the Peruvian bark every day the per&s;on does not bathe; ob&s;erving to inter|mit the medicine occa&s;ionally for a few days. A light tincture of the bark, join|ed to bitters, may be u&s;ed in this manner with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When acids do not di&s;agree with the &s;to|mach, twenty or thirty drops of the elixir of vitriol may be taken once or twice a|day, in a &s;mall di&s;h of camomile or ro&s;e|mary tea.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide tho&s;e remedies, and a &s;trict at|tention to diet, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the pa|tient u&s;e daily exerci&s;e; than which no|thing is more conducive to promote di|ge&s;tion, facilitate &s;leep, and re&s;tore to the con&s;titution the po&s;&s;ible degree of &s;trength. Both the kind and duration of exerci&s;e mu&s;t be &s;uited to the &s;tate of the patient.
<PB N="33" REF="34">The mo&s;t beneficial is riding on hor&s;e|back. Whatever be the exerci&s;e, the per|&s;on &s;hould carefully avoid fatigue, which not only retards the cure, but excites pal|pitations and &s;pa&s;ms of different parts, with variety of unea&s;ine&s;s. In tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, fetid medicines have peculiar power. Of u&s;e they may be al&s;o to allay the craving of the &s;tomach, to which nervous per&s;ons are frequently &s;ubject. But this &s;ymptom finds, perhaps, no bet|ter remedy than a cru&s;t of bread, or any thing &s;olid.</P>
<P>A dry air, temperately cool rather than warm, is mo&s;t favorable to the cure of nervous di&s;orders. If ever the Peruvian bark be preferable to cold-bathing, it is during a moi&s;t &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere. At lea&s;t in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons it might be alternat|ed with the other. In moi&s;t weather, the fle&s;h-bru&s;h is al&s;o of particular &s;ervice; but it &s;hould always be admini&s;tered by an attendant. For a nervous per&s;on is &s;oon
<PB N="34" REF="35">fatigued with the exerci&s;e: and as the mo&s;t proper time for it is that of going to bed, the con&s;equence of &s;uch fatigue might be continued watchfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the treatment of nervous di&s;orders, no care is more important than that of pre&s;erving tranquillity. Vexation, grief, and de&s;pondence are peculiarly injurious; while on the other hand, chearfulne&s;s, and whatever promotes it, as agreeable com|pany and amu&s;ement, e&s;&s;entially conduce to the cure; which may be al&s;o con&s;ider|ably forwarded by the practice of early ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>When the di&s;order may have re&s;i&s;ted all the above remedies, from the u&s;e of a milk-diet has relief &s;ometimes been ef|fected. But this final re&s;ource mu&s;t either be continued during life, or quit|ted with great caution, and by &s;low de|grees.</P>
