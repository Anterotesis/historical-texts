<P>ACCORDING to my promi&s;e, made this morning at our parting, I &s;hall dedicate all my lei&s;ure moments to my dear Eliza, and amu&s;e her with the little occurrences, or ob&s;ervations of the day, ju&s;t as they pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my pen;
<PB N="4" REF="4">I &s;ay, ju&s;t as they pre&s;ent them&s;elves, by way of giving you warning, that you are not to expect much order or method in my Letters: but I fancy our former cor|re&s;pondence may have given you &s;ome idea that my &s;tyle is not renowned for either. However, if you are diverted, that is the chief point with me, for I have my fears that great part of your time will pa&s;s but heavily, as I am very apprehen&s;ive your mother's health will &s;uffer by going from a very warm hou&s;e in town, to a very cold one (&s;urrounded by ponds and lakes) in the country, at this dreary &s;ea&s;on, you know what bad effect it had on her la&s;t winter, though the weather was uncom|monly mild; and I really think it was very unnece&s;&s;ary for her to run any ha|zard, as the chief purpo&s;e of her going could have been accompli&s;hed as well, had &s;he &s;taid in town; it is, I allow, a very laudable cu&s;tom to be kind to the tenants, to entertain them, and make them happy at the approaching &s;ea&s;on; but I think, as &s;he is &s;o delicate, Mr. Skef|fington might as well have done the ho|nours of Chri&s;tmas to your tenants as his own, &s;ince it mu&s;t be done in his hou&s;e, your's being &s;ett. I hope, however, my fears may prove without foundation, both
<PB N="5" REF="5">for her &s;ake and yours; for then I know you will be happy any where with her, and another per&s;on that &s;hall be namele&s;s. &mdash;You contrived mighty ill to leave town to-day, for by &s;o doing you lo&s;t a mo&s;t glorious &s;ight; a large body of our Volunteers a&s;&s;embled, to honour the me|mory of King William, who made a ve|ry fine appearance, and fired &s;everal vol|lies, even better than the Regulars, who performed the &s;ame ceremony an hour or two after. Every one looked delighted, except &s;ome few, who want to be thought friends to Government, but for me who am an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e of Liber|ty and my country, I was wonderfully delighted to &s;ee our men of the fir&s;t rank and property, as well as our mo&s;t eminent citizens, voluntarily arming in defence of both: I think it warms one's heart, and I really pity your lukewarm &s;ouls, who can &s;ee &s;uch a &s;ight without emotion.&mdash;</P>
<P>November 5th. I had wrote thus far ye&s;terday, and &s;hould perhaps have ex|patiated for &s;ome time on the love of our country, but that I was agreeably interrupt|ed by the arrival of an unexpected vi&s;itor; a thundering rap at the door, threw all
<PB N="6" REF="6">the family into con&s;ternation, as it was a very unu&s;ual hour for company: I, who &s;at by the window, &s;tood up, and looking through the gla&s;s, &s;aw a po&s;t-chai&s;e and four hor&s;es up to their bellies in mud, the po&s;tilions and &s;ervants all in black: the door was &s;oon opened, and out &s;tepped the prettie&s;t young widow I ever &s;aw; I be|lieve you will ea&s;ily recollect this de&s;crip|tion &s;uits but one of our acquaintance; it was no other than our dear Emily: I flew to welcome her, and in a minute a thou&s;and que&s;tions were a&s;ked by each, without either waiting for an an&s;wer: however, when we were &s;eated, and be|gan to be more coherent, I told her &s;he &s;hould be my gue&s;t, as I had &s;pare beds for her and her maid, and the men might go with their hor&s;es, for I had not room for them; and if I had, &s;he knew, I could not abide to run foul of a &s;ervant fellow every &s;tep I took about my hou&s;e: &s;he &s;miled at the expre&s;&s;ion, but &s;aid, &s;he had as little liking to them as I, when they could be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and that &s;he would gladly accept my invitation, that &s;he might have as much of my company as po&s;&s;ible while &s;he &s;taid. Gertrude, who, you know, is the mother of this family, no &s;ooner heard this affair regulated, than
<PB N="7" REF="7">&s;he quitted the room to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders; for that is a trouble &s;he takes entirely on her&s;elf, and indeed &s;he makes a much better figure in the office than I &s;hould do, &s;o I am mighty willing to in|dulge her in it. Emily and I being left quite to our&s;elves till tea-time, you may imagine we had no lack of chat; I found the bu&s;ine&s;s that hurried her to town was to admini&s;ter to her hu&s;band's will; it &s;eems her tender care of him, during an illne&s;s of &s;ix months, touched his con&s;cience, and by way of amends for the very un|kind treatment he had given her, all the while &s;he was his wife, he made a will, to which he appointed her Executrix, and left her the intere&s;t of a large &s;um of ready money during her life, in addition to her jointure, and &s;ome part of the principal at her di&s;po&s;al: &s;he is al&s;o to be guardian to the child, and have the care of the e&s;tate; I know no one more capa|ble of managing it for the child's advan|tage: the man certainly meant well at la&s;t, but I think the greate&s;t favour he could confer on her was his dying; for her own fortune is &s;o large, that &s;he only wanted to be allowed to enjoy it in comfort, and what he has left her, will, I am &s;ure, be no great addition to her happine&s;s, for
<PB N="8" REF="8">I know few that value riches le&s;s than &s;he, nor none that make a better u&s;e of them. Lovely as &s;he was when la&s;t you &s;aw her, you can &s;carce have an idea of what &s;he is now! She is of the middle &s;ize, ele|gantly formed, and has a feminine &s;weet|ne&s;s in her air and manner, that is ea&s;ier imagined than de&s;cribed; her weeds be|come her amazingly; and there is a lan|gour in her countenance, contracted du|ring the two unhappy years &s;he was a wife, &s;o peculiarly &s;uited to her habit, that it intere&s;ts one, you cannot think how much, in her favour. I cannot with any degree of patience reflect on her being &s;acrificed to a man, with whom it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could be happy, merely becau&s;e his e&s;tate and her father's were contiguous: it is a&s;toni&s;hing to think, that &s;uch ridiculous motives can actuate rational creatures, in the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances of life: I cannot &s;ay I &s;hould have been quite &s;o obedient as Emily was; for a child has a natural right to a negative voice, when it concerns the happine&s;s of her life. I do not mean by that to ju&s;tify all the pretty ma&s;ters and mi&s;&s;es who in direct oppo&s;ition to the will of their parents, as well as to every dic|tate of rea&s;on and di&s;cretion, are daily
<PB N="9" REF="9">performing the tragedy of, All for Love; and indeed, it u&s;ually turns out a very deep tragedy to them; for whatever they may think before marriage, they &s;oon after di&s;cover, that a competency, ac|cording to their rank in life, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to matrimonial felicity: but I think in chu&s;ing a hu&s;band for a girl, her friends &s;hould be careful to fix on one, who&s;e qualities of mind and temper, are &s;uch as would be capable of in&s;piring her with that tender e&s;teem, which, according to my notions, is much more likely to be la&s;ting than fierce flaming love; for that being more a pa&s;&s;ion than a &s;entiment, is, like all other violent pa&s;&s;ions, very apt to &s;ub&s;ide, and leave no traces but what are unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>I took the opportunity of Emily's be|ing out on bu&s;ine&s;s, to fini&s;h my letter for the po&s;t, as I think you will be unea&s;y if I defer it longer. I hear her carriage &s;top, &s;o &s;hall conclude, for as her &s;tay will be but &s;hort in town, I would not wi&s;h to leave her when &s;he is at home; &s;he is come up and bid me &s;ay a thou&s;and kind things for her, to dear Eliza: Gertrude expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf much in the &s;ame man|ner.
<PB N="10" REF="10">But I hope you have more con&s;ci|ence than to expect I &s;hould impart all they &s;ay: I &s;hall therefore leave you to &s;uppo&s;e them; and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Mi&s;s FITZGERALD, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Ca&s;tle-Skeffington, <DATE>Nov. 7. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot imagine, Loui&s;a, how much I was di&s;appointed this morn|ing, when the &s;ervant returned from the po&s;t-hou&s;e without a letter from you! I &s;uppo&s;e I looked vexed, for Charles, who ju&s;t then come into the room, a&s;ked what occa&s;ioned my chagrin, and when he heard, ob&s;erved, you had promi&s;ed to write; but tho&s;e who relied on women's promi&s;es, would generally find them&s;elves di&s;appointed; and added &s;ome unfavour|able reflections on female friend&s;hip; this affronted me, and I told him, if men were but half &s;o &s;incere in their friend|&s;hips, there would be a good deal le&s;s de|ceit and fraud in the world than there is at pre&s;ent: he &s;aw I was warm, and tak|ing my hand, &s;aid, my dear Eliza, you &s;eem angry, &s;ure you cannot &s;uppo&s;e I was &s;erious, for you know I have the highe&s;t re&s;pect for Mi&s;s Mortimer, and if I had not, I would not willingly &s;ay any thing to offend you; I really did but joke, and thought you would take it as
<PB N="12" REF="12">&s;uch: I accepted his apology, and we be|came friends again.</P>
<P>But are not you &s;urpri&s;ed at my warmth on &s;uch a trivial matter, and what might well be taken as a je&s;t? I allow it mu&s;t &s;eem &s;o to you; but I was di&s;plea&s;ed with, and had rea&s;on to think he was more &s;eri|ous, than, on recollection, he cho&s;e to pre|tend. You mu&s;t know, I have di&s;covered in him a propen&s;ity to jealou&s;y, which has al|armed me mo&s;t exceedingly, as it may be productive of great unhappine&s;s to us both. But to tell my &s;tory with &s;ome method, I mu&s;t inform you, that at the la&s;t Inn we lay at, we were joined by a Mr. Hamilton, a young man of large fortune in the county of Derry, who be|ing alone, Charles invited to &s;up with us, and we e&s;teemed him no &s;mall acqui&s;iti|on to our company; for he has had a li|beral education, is ju&s;t returned from his travels, and makes &s;uch ob&s;ervations on the laws, cu&s;toms and manners of differ|ent nations, as do credit to his under|&s;tanding, and promi&s;e fair for his being an ornament to his own country. You may think &s;uch a companion made us all very chearful, and I, who delight in &s;uch &s;ubjects, drew him on to give us a little
<PB N="13" REF="13">de&s;cription of the mo&s;t material places he pa&s;&s;ed through, which he did in &s;uch ea&s;y, elegant language, that when he re|tired to his chamber, he left us full of his prai&s;es, that is, my mother and I, for Charles had grown very grave, and very &s;ilent for &s;ome time before; when my mother ob&s;erved it &s;he a&s;ked the cau&s;e, and he attributed it to a head-ach, upon which we &s;eparated for the night, in hopes re&s;t would relieve him. In the morning he &s;eemed quite recovered; Mr. Hamil|ton joined us at breakfa&s;t; politely re|gretted that he was to take a different road, and gave Charles a pre&s;&s;ing invita|tion to his hou&s;e, where he &s;hould be in le&s;s than a month, as he was to &s;tay about that time on a vi&s;it to a relation in this country: Charles promi&s;ed to go, on condition he would return with him. This point being &s;ettled, and breakfa&s;t over, he attended us to our carriage, where taking a very re&s;pectful leave of my mo|ther, and a very gallant one of me; we all &s;et out on our different journeys, and reached home in the evening without meet|ing any other adventure. I took notice that Charles was at times very thoughtful, and though I had a &s;mall &s;u&s;picion of the cau&s;e, I &s;till hoped I was mi&s;taken, till I
<PB N="14" REF="14">was put out of doubt this morning, by Kitty, who, while &s;he attended me, &s;aid, &s;he thought it her duty to inform me Mr. Skeffington had a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions concerning my opinion of Mr. Hamilton, whether I had talked of him, when &s;he was undre&s;&s;ing me la&s;t night, and in &s;hort was &s;o inqui&s;itive, that the girl, who you know, has not much pe|netration, perceived he was jealous. I was very &s;orry he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf, and very much vexed that he had talked in &s;uch a manner to my &s;ervant, which was in effect making her a &s;py over me; be&s;ides that, if &s;he was ill di&s;po&s;ed it was putting it in her power to tell lies, and make mi&s;chief, for &s;ake of a bribe he offered her, to tell him the truth; his behaviour hurt me greatly, and was the cau&s;e of my anger at what he had &s;aid this morning, which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have thought worth notice; however, his being &s;o concerned at di&s;plea&s;ing me, and the particular attention he has paid me all day, &s;hew how anxious he is to be agreeable to me, and makes it impo&s;&s;ible for me to retain any di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him; I flatter my&s;elf my conduct will cure him of that unhappy propen&s;ity; but I will be very &s;ure it has before I
<PB N="15" REF="15">think of being united to him. I have no doubt but to-morrow's po&s;t will bring a letter from you, and will leave this unfi|ni&s;hed till then, though it is already of a rea&s;onable length; but, for my own part, I think letters of friend&s;hip can never be too long, nor tho&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s too &s;hort.</P>
<P>Nov. 8th. As I expected, this po&s;t has brought a letter from you, in which you fully account for the delay, the arri|val of &s;uch a welcome vi&s;itor, is &s;ufficient apology; I am however well plea&s;ed &s;he gave you an opportunity of di&s;patching your epi&s;tle next day; for I think my pa|tience would not have held out another po&s;t, and I &s;hould have joined Charles, in exclaiming again&s;t the ficklene&s;s of wo|man. It was very mal-a-propos of Emily, not to come into town 'till the day I left it; for I &s;hould have great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing her ea&s;y and happy; and though it is a &s;hocking thing to &s;ay, yet &s;he certainly never could be either while Mr. Rochfort lived, as an unkind hu&s;band mu&s;t de&s;troy any woman's peace: I am glad for his own &s;ake he had the ju&s;tice to acknowlege her merit before his death; however, he was of &s;uch an unhappy temper, that had he recovered, I doubt not, he would have relap&s;ed into his former caprice and ill-nature,
<PB N="16" REF="16">I am no great friend to &s;econd marriages; but I think Emily would be ve|ry excu&s;able &s;hould &s;he make choice of one with whom &s;he's likely to be happy; for &s;he is now at an age very &s;ubject to tender im|pre&s;&s;ions, and the time &s;he pa&s;&s;ed with her hu&s;band, can only be reckoned a time of &s;lavery: Whatever &s;tate &s;he chu&s;es, I hope &s;he will enjoy all the happine&s;s in it &s;he &s;o well de&s;erves: thank her and Gertrude for their kind remembrance of me; and tell them no one loves them better. I &s;hall not be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to expect you will be a very punctual corre&s;pon|dent while your gue&s;t is with you, as &s;he is not to &s;tay long; but I flatter my|&s;elf, when you can &s;teal half an hour, you won't forget your promi&s;e.&mdash;O! but I was quite unlucky in leaving town the day I did; for be&s;ides mi&s;&s;ing Emily, I lo&s;t &s;eeing the Volunteers, which I am very &s;orry for, as I think them a mo&s;t re&s;pectable body, and you know I am as public-&s;pirited as any Roman Ma|tron, in the mo&s;t virtuous ages of the commonwealth, I mean; for I would not chu&s;e to compare my&s;elf to a Roman, after they were governed by the Em|perors, becau&s;e that Government was the cau&s;e of their being degenerated, and &s;unk
<PB N="17" REF="17">in luxury and corruption; &s;o you &s;ee I have no &s;mall opinion of my&s;elf, at lea&s;t of my public virtue; and whatever others may think, I am &s;atisfied, if women were taught di&s;intere&s;ted love for their coun|try, there would be more patriots among&s;t the men than there are at pre&s;ent, for &s;e|veral obvious rea&s;ons; particularly that, as there are few of them that don't wi&s;h to recommend them&s;elves to our favour, they would be very cautious how they acted in their public capacity, if they knew our contempt would be the con&s;equence of their apo&s;tacy. No doubt the ancients were of this opinion; for you may find, in the mo&s;t glorious times of Greece and Rome, the women were ju&s;t as warm in their country's cau&s;e, as the men: and hi&s;tory has applauded them for it; though now people affect to think tho&s;e things above our capacity, and indeed the pre&s;ent mode of education for our &s;ex is &s;o very trifling, that I fear there is &s;ome truth in the &s;up|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>When I am writing to you, my pen, I think, runs on of it&s;elf, and I know not when to &s;top it; &s;o plea&s;ing are the com|munications of unre&s;erved friend&s;hip! the hour for the po&s;t going out reminds me,
<PB N="18" REF="18">it is time to conclude. It is probable you will hear from me very &s;oon again, as I don't intend &s;tanding on ceremony with you, e&s;pecially while Mrs. Rochfort is in Dublin.</P>

<P>COUSIN James Fitzgerald came here ye&s;terday, to &s;tay with us till he &s;ets off for Dublin, to attend Parliament, which will be to-morrow, and I could not think of letting him go without a line to my dear Loui&s;a, as I know the fir&s;t vi&s;it he makes in town will be to you: for I a&s;&s;ure you, you &s;tand very high in his opi|nion; and let me tell you, all the young ladies in the country &s;et a great value on them&s;elves, if they can obtain his appro|bation; for, as you have often ob&s;erved, he has a good head, and a good heart, and is e&s;teemed accordingly. There is few of our gentlemen that would not wi&s;h him for a &s;on-in-law: but though he makes him&s;elf perfectly plea&s;ing in women's company, and likes being among them, no one &s;eems, as yet, to have made any impre&s;&s;ion on him. I bid him guard his heart again&s;t the fair widow, but he is no way apprehen&s;ive, he &s;ays; however, I in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="20">on it to him, that Mrs. Rochford will over|come all his &s;en&s;ibility at fir&s;t &s;ight, though I am far from believing what I &s;ay, as I am certain when he attaches him&s;elf to any woman, it will be from conviction that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the beauties of the mind, even in preference to tho&s;e of the per&s;on, which are the only motives to tho&s;e who fall in love at fir&s;t look; a foundation that promi&s;es no great permanency in the pa&s;|&s;ion; for I look on it as a proof either of a very weak mind, or uncommon &s;u&s;|ceptibility; or perhaps a mixture of both, and in any of the ca&s;es, great ficklene&s;s is to be expected.</P>
<P>I wrote to you &s;o lately, that I have now nothing material to impart, except that I hope Charles's good &s;en&s;e has con|quered his late tendency to jealou&s;y; for I have not &s;een the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of it &s;ince, though there has been &s;everal agree|able young men to vi&s;it us, within the&s;e few days; this hope has given infinite &s;atisfaction: for I confe&s;s his affection is nece&s;&s;ary to my happine&s;s, yet I never could think of being his wife &s;hould he continue in that unfortunate di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="21">
<P>We are to have vi&s;itors to-morrow; a Mr. Boyle and his daughters; they came to this neighbourhood ju&s;t before I went la&s;t to town, I paid my compliments to them, but leaving the country two days after, I did not &s;ee them &s;ince, &s;o I cannot &s;ay much about them: if they &s;hould prove agreeable they will be an acqui&s;iti|on, as they are but a &s;hort walk from us. I believe I told you, Bell-Park was left to Mr. Boyle by his uncle, who was a de|lightful old man: I hope his relations may be as plea&s;ing. In my next, you &s;hall have my opinion of them. My mother is pretty well as yet; I &s;hall be very happy if &s;he does but continue &s;o till we get to town again, for it alarms me much to have her ill here.</P>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;teal a moment &s;ince I wrote la&s;t, to tell my Eliza how much I am concerned at the defect you have di&s;covered in Mr. Skeffington's tem|per; it may cau&s;e you a deal of unea&s;i|ne&s;s, for it is &s;eldom cured. I depend but little on your hopes of his having con|quered it, for you are a partial judge, be|ing &s;o prejudiced in his favour; be&s;ides people are apt to believe what they wi&s;h; but when you all come to town, I &s;hall have a watchful eye over him, and will not let you deceive your&s;elf in a point &s;o material to your happine&s;s. I doubt that you will think your&s;elf much obliged to me, though I am &s;ure you ought, for you mu&s;t allow, a woman in love &s;tands in need of a friend to &s;ee things in a proper light for her, as &s;he is utterly incapable of &s;eeing with her own eyes, when the beloved object is any way concerned. I think if Charles does not mend his man|ners, you &s;hall marry Mr. Hamilton;
<PB N="23" REF="23">that is, if I do not; for I fancy I &s;hould like him for my&s;elf, by your de&s;cription of him, but we will con&s;ider of the&s;e matters hereafter. At pre&s;ent I want to tell you, I received your la&s;t epi&s;tle by your very agreeable letter-carrier, who de|livered it him&s;elf the day after he arrived in town. Emily was out when he came, but I a&s;ked him for the evening, and then in|troduced him to her; he admires her as every one does, but as to any thing more, I do not take his heart to be very vulne|rable. Do you know that a hand&s;ome widow, of eighteen, is too great an at|traction for a &s;ober, &s;edate &s;pin&s;ter to have in her home.</P>
<P>I am ab&s;olutely fatigued with entertain|ing all the fine fellows that come here &s;ince &s;he has been my gue&s;t. They pay me the compliment of their vi&s;its, but I am not &s;o vain as to take them to my&s;elf, for I know if &s;he was not here, I &s;hould not be honoured with their company above once in a month, and indeed I think it often enough in all con&s;cience to be trou|bled with them, for my &s;pirits are quite|wearied with the ince&s;&s;ant peal of non&s;en&s;e they think it nece&s;&s;ary to ring in the ears.
<PB N="24" REF="24">of every woman of this &s;ide forty: after that age, I fancy one would be pretty free from them. To be fure &s;ome of them could not talk &s;en&s;e, but I &s;hould be glad tho&s;e that can, would be convinced that women are rational creatures as well as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I really think the generality of young women have more &s;olid &s;en&s;e than the young men; at lea&s;t, it is &s;o in the circle of my acquaintance. But this is ENTRE|NOUS: for &s;hould it be known I thought &s;o, the whole Male Sex would be up in arms again&s;t me at once, becau&s;e good|&s;en&s;e is one of the things they would willingly make us believe they have an exclu&s;ive patent for. But I, who hate monopolies, cannot help putting in a claim to &s;hare of the commodity for &s;elf and Co. to &s;peak in the trading &s;tyle, which is mighty convenient when one is in ha&s;te, though &s;o laconic.</P>
<P>You are a good girl in laying a&s;ide ceremony in our corre&s;pondence; it would be quite barbarous to in&s;i&s;t on an an&s;wer to every letter, now my time is not my own; it is very well if I can give you a
<PB N="25" REF="25">&s;hort acknowlegement for two or three at a time.</P>
<P>Emily will, I fancy, &s;tay longer than &s;he at fir&s;t propo&s;ed: &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s has occured that cannot be &s;oon concluded. True it is &s;hocking enough to date a wo|man's happine&s;s from the death of her hu&s;band; but if hu&s;bands will be brutes, they mu&s;t expect both their wife and her friends will wi&s;h them dead. Emily behaves with the utmo&s;t propriety; never &s;peaking a reproachful word of Mr. Roch|ford, for tho' one mu&s;t think &s;he is plea&s;ed at her relea&s;e, it would not be decent in her to &s;ay &s;o. I like your political &s;enti|ments, they exactly coincide with my own: I &s;ee no rea&s;on why women &s;hould not be patriots; for &s;urely, if tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion are e&s;tabli&s;hed in a country, they are more liable to &s;uffer from it, both in their per&s;ons and properties than men, becau&s;e le&s;s able to defend them&s;elves: it, therefore, concerns them much, to u&s;e all their influence in oppo&s;ing it; and doubtle&s;s that influence is more powerful than people are aware of; they &s;hould, therefore, be taught to u&s;e it for the good of mankind, both as it relates to indivi|duals, and the community at large. What
<PB N="26" REF="26">a pity you and I were not born in anci|ent Greece! we &s;hould have made a noble figure in Hi&s;tory, as Spartan wives or mo|thers.</P>
<P>Yes, I was &s;urpri&s;ed at your warmth, before I knew the cau&s;e, and for that matter, I am &s;urpri&s;ed &s;till: for you are &s;uch a &s;oft, gentle, &s;oul, &s;o formed for the tender pa&s;&s;ion, that I did not think it was in nature for you to be di&s;plea&s;ed with your beloved two minutes together; e&s;pecially when his crime proceeded from his too great affection for you. I am glad, however, to find you are getting a little &s;pirit; I often advi&s;ed you to it, and you &s;ee what effect it had: your anger brought him out of his airs in an in&s;tant, where|as I will venture to &s;ay, your tenderne&s;s would not have done it in a month. No|thing like &s;hewing one's authority now and then; it makes one appear of con|&s;equence, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep down the domineering temper of tho&s;e lords of the creation.</P>
<P>I am going with Emily and Gertrude, to &s;pend the evening with a friend. Oh! I have a &s;ecret to tell you of Gertrude;
<PB N="27" REF="27">it is a love affair too, therefore ju&s;t fit for your ear: how was it &s;he never made you her confidant. I cannot tell it now, as they wait for me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 14.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to promi&s;e, I go on writing to my dear Loui&s;a, without waiting for an an&s;wer: I do not, howe|ver, want to pa&s;s it on you as a great obligation, for I think I could not exi&s;t any time without communicating to you all the little incidents that occur, and con&s;titute part of my happine&s;s; but I will acknowlege, hearing from you, is a material addition to it.</P>
<P>I informed you in my la&s;t, Mr. Boyle and family were to be with us next day; they came much earlier than is u&s;ual with &s;trangers, to &s;hew us, as he &s;aid, they wi&s;hed to be on a friendly footing, and hoped we would follow the example, which we did the very next day, for we were plea&s;ed with each other: we did not part till after &s;upper, nor would they quit us, till we promi&s;ed to return their vi&s;it
<PB N="29" REF="29">&s;o immediately. I wi&s;hed for you often, you would be infinitely charmed with Mr. Boyle, who is a true born Iri&s;h-man: generous, ho&s;pitable and humane; accom|panied with a quality for which our coun|try-men are not much renowned. That is, &s;uch a prudent &oelig;conomy as prevents him from out-running his fortune, though every thing in his family is in the gen|teele&s;t &s;tyle of life, and he is continualy doing good-natured or charitable actions; but he does not throw away his money; nor do his daughters think it beneath them to attend to the management of hou&s;hold affairs. He is mighty chearful, and has, I think, all the good di&s;po&s;ition of his uncle. His daughters are rather pretty, the younge&s;t mo&s;t &s;o, and &s;he knows it; &s;he is about eighteen, her &s;i&s;ter two years older. Mi&s;s Boyle plea&s;es me be&s;t, for &s;he is &s;en&s;ible and agreeable, without any airs. Mi&s;s Harriet has a good under&s;tand|ing, improved by reading, but &s;he has a degree of affectation that &s;poils her, when &s;he lays that a&s;ide, which &s;he can do, &s;he is very plea&s;ing. I believe it is the effect of a fooli&s;h vanity on account of her per|&s;onal charms; and I am &s;urpri&s;ed that one who&s;e mind is &s;o amply endowed, &s;hould
<PB N="30" REF="30">fall into &s;uch a weakne&s;s; but probably a few years will cure her of that folly, and &s;he will then be an amiable woman. I am very happy in having them for neigh|bours, as there is not a young per&s;on of my own &s;ex in any of the families very near us, except one, and &s;he is as unfit a companion for a rational being as any ve|getable in her garden, which is the only thing in life &s;he &s;eems to have any know|lege of. Unfortunately for the poor girl, &s;he will have a very large e&s;tate, and her mother thinks it unnece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould have any thing el&s;e to recommend her. I really pity the poor thing; for, no doubt, &s;he will, &s;ome time or other, find her ignorance a great inconvenience to her. What ill-judging people they mu&s;t be, who can look on money as a good &s;ub&s;ti|tute for all the u&s;eful and agreeable qua|lifications of the mind.</P>
<P>I will lay this by for a while, in hopes of hearing from you; be&s;ides the Mi&s;s Boyle's are come in to tea, and I dare &s;ay, I &s;hall have no more time for writing this evening.</P>
<P>November 18th. I gue&s;&s;ed right when I &s;aid I &s;hould have no time for writing
<PB N="31" REF="31">that day. The young ladies were ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;tay &s;upper, as their father was not expected home till next day, he was gone &s;ome miles off to &s;ee a friend. We had al&s;o &s;ome gentlemen that Charles had brought home with him, and we were a very chearful happy party: my mother was quite delighted, for you know how happy &s;he is to &s;ee me plea&s;ed: and I had the &s;atisfaction to find that her pre&s;ence was no re&s;traint on the young folks. In|deed it need not, for though &s;he is elderly and not healthy, &s;he does not forget &s;he was once young her&s;elf: and therefore endeavours to promote innocent mirth in youth, which, as &s;he &s;ays, is the proper &s;ea&s;on for it; and &s;he is loved and re&s;pected accordingly. I am &s;ure her advice would have much greater weight with them, than that of any of your formal peevi&s;h old la|dies, who having lo&s;t a reli&s;h for amu&s;e|ments them&s;elves are continually preaching again&s;t them, be they ever &s;o innocent, or moderately pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The gentlemen &s;taid here till this morn|ing, and we had a good deal of company in the forenoon, &s;ome of them &s;taid din|ner.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="32">
<P>Ye&s;terday we all &s;pent an agreeable even|ing at Bell-Park, by invitation; both the ladies are proficients on the Harp&s;icord, and have &s;weet voices; and one of our gentlemen played enchantingly on the flute; &s;o we made up a little concert, and the cards were laid a&s;ide, except Mr. Boyle, who challenged my mother at pic|quet, and was not a little plea&s;ed at beat|ing her, becau&s;e &s;he plays the game infi|nitely &s;uperior to him.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received your epi&s;tle; how could you be &s;o tea&s;ing as to &s;ay you had a &s;ecret to tell me? and then leave me to puzzle my brains about it, perhaps for this week to come: you &s;uppo&s;e every one to have as little curio&s;ity as your&s;elf; though you know it is a legacy de&s;cended to us from our grandmother Eve, of which very few have not a large &s;hare.</P>
<P>I have thought of all the young men that vi&s;it you, but cannot recollect that Gertrude ever &s;hewed the &s;malle&s;t partia|lity for one of them; though I know &s;ome of them admired her much: who can it be? I may as well bid you adieu,

<DIV3 TYPE="letter proper">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 17. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE retired to my chamber rather earlier than u&s;ual, that I may acknow|lege the receipt of my dear Eliza's la&s;t favour; and gratify her curio&s;ity, which, I find, is at the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>I really did not think of di&s;tracting your mind &s;o much, when I mentioned Ger|trude's affair, as it would not have had that effect on me; and when I con&s;idered, that I had no right to di&s;clo&s;e another per&s;on's &s;ecrets: I determined to tell you my &s;eru|ples on that head, and leave you in ig|norance till time &s;hould di&s;cover it. How|ever, your letter made me alter my mind, and Gertrude being pre&s;ent, I &s;hewed it to her, and telling her I had thoughtle&s;sly given you a hint of it, a&s;ked her permi&s;|&s;ion to inform you of the affair. She &s;miled at your eagerne&s;s to know the event, and &s;aid, it would be a pity to deprive me of &s;uch an agreeable corre&s;pondent
<PB N="35" REF="35">on that account, as &s;he was &s;ure it would be &s;afe with Mi&s;s Fitzgerald: and &s;he believed you would make allowances for the weakne&s;s of her heart, your own was &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible. So you &s;ee, my dear, your tenderne&s;s is very vi&s;ible, though you flat|tered your&s;elf no one perceived it but me.</P>
<P>As to this love tale, you may gue&s;s, it was mere accident di&s;covered it to me; for as you ob&s;erve, I have very little curio&s;ity. But if I had ever &s;o much, it could not have been excited in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e I had no &s;u&s;picion: and thus it happened.</P>
<P>A few days before I wrote to you la&s;t, I was to have company in the evening; and when I was dre&s;&s;ed, &s;tepped into Ger|trude's chamber to a&s;k her &s;ome que&s;tions; &s;he &s;at with her back towards me, &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that &s;he never heard me, though I was near enough to &s;ee. She held in her hand a miniature picture of a beautiful youth, in the uniform of the French military, on which her eyes were intently fixed. You cannot imagine what an aukward &s;ituation I found my&s;elf in, when I &s;aw &s;he had not heard me. I &s;elt as if I had purpo&s;ely &s;tolen on her priva|cy,
<PB N="36" REF="36">though I was con&s;cious I had not, but it mu&s;t appear &s;o to her. I therefore, thought, if I could go out unperceived, it would &s;ave us both a deal of confu&s;ion; and was turning about to do &s;o, when the ru&s;tling of my gown again&s;t her chair, rou&s;ed her from her reverie, and &s;tartled her &s;o much, that I thought &s;he would have fainted: I am &s;ure I looked very &s;illy my&s;elf, but thinking it be&s;t to take no notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed, I a&s;ked the que&s;tion I came about, and then &s;aying I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would &s;oon be ready to come down, I left her to recover her&s;elf from the flutter into which I had unin|tentionally thrown her.</P>
<P>She did not come into the drawing|room, till &s;ome of the company were come, and I could ob&s;erve, her &s;pirits &s;eemed quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but &s;he exerted her&s;elf to conceal it, and as &s;he is naturally rather &s;eri|ous, it pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed by every one al|&s;o. I paid more than u&s;ual attention to her, that &s;he might &s;ee I was not offended at her re&s;erve: for I am certain, it pro|ceeded more from ba&s;hfulne&s;s than want of confidence in my friend&s;hip. Though &s;he lived &s;o long in France, &s;he &s;till has
<PB N="37" REF="37">that amiable mode&s;ty, which is there call|ed, MAU VAIS HONTE; but which in my opinion, is quite becoming in a young girl, though it is now reckoned a capital offence again&s;t all the rules of good-breed|ing to be capable of blu&s;hing. And it is part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of French dancing|ma&s;ters, to cure their pupils of that vul|gar propen&s;ity, and &s;ub&s;titute an a&s;&s;ur|ance, that will enable a Mi&s;s of fourteen to come into a room full of company with a broad &s;tare, as if &s;he meant to defy them to put her out of countenance. An undaunted woman of any age, is, I think, &s;hocking, but in a young creature it is ab&s;olutely di&s;gu&s;tinge be&s;ides, &s;etting a girl above &s;hame, is breaking through one of the &s;tronge&s;t barriers of female virtue: and we &s;ee daily examples of it in Eng|land, where the fa&s;hionable mode of edu|cation has introduced a levity among&s;t the women, that even out-does their neigh|bours on the Continent. I much fear we &s;hall catch the infection; for where the intercour&s;e is &s;o frequent, it will be next to a miracle if the contagion does not &s;pread; and I have long ob&s;erved, that neither the manners nor morals of my
<PB N="38" REF="38">country people are at all improved by a jaunt to England.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay I have wandered far from my &s;ubject; but I intend giving Gertrude's &s;tory a &s;heet of paper to it&s;elf, that your patience may not be put to &s;uch a trial, as being obliged to go through &s;o much of my letter to come at it.</P>
<P>I congratulate you on the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch agreeable neighbours, and hope they will come to town, that I may endeavour to rival your mother in Mr. Boyle's good graces; for I &s;hould like of all things, to have a flirt above fifty, and I &s;uppo&s;e he is that age at lea&s;t. And be&s;ides that, I would try to cure Mi&s;s Harriet of her affectation, which, by your de&s;cription, is the greate&s;t defect &s;he has. Well, there is none of us perfect; &s;o we mu&s;t take human nature as we find it, and make allowance for its frailties: it is be&s;t to laugh people out of their follies, and be &s;evere on their vices.</P>
<P>I know who your female vegetable is, it was the happie&s;t idea you ever had, for you could not chu&s;e a more &s;uitable ap|pellation. I am by no means &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="39" REF="39">that her mother &s;hould think a large e&s;tate required no other qualification, becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf had no other; and to be &s;ure her father is of the &s;ame opinion, as it was all he thought nece&s;&s;ary in a wi&s;e. Is it not amazing that any man of &s;en&s;e, can make choice of a woman to pa&s;s his life with, that has not a &s;ufficient under|&s;tanding to make her an agreeable com|panion, even for an hour? yet one &s;ees &s;uch wives every day; and the poor things think they are of great con&s;equence, and have an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of their creation, if they can &s;cold their &s;ervants, and &s;warm the hou&s;e with chil|dren, though they are totally incapable of in&s;tructing their children in any one thing that is proper for them to know. I have no doubt but the men chu&s;e them, that their own &s;uperiority in wi&s;dom and knowledge may appear to greater advan|tage by the contra&s;t, and &s;ome of them, I am &s;ure, dread a competitor in tho&s;e things.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have a bad opinion of your vi&s;itors, if they di&s;liked your mother's company. A woman of her di&s;po&s;ition, though not very young, cannot be a re|&s;traint on any one, unle&s;s they wi&s;h to
<PB N="40" REF="40">behave improperly. Good night, I mu&s;t begin my &s;tory, which will keep me up an hour longer, and I feel I &s;hall be very &s;leepy before it is fini&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD>Count de ROUSSILLON, and Mi&s;s S. GEORGE.</HEAD>
<P>GERTRUDE came into my chamber next morning ju&s;t as I was ri&s;ing; and telling Sally &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me to dre&s;s, as &s;he wi&s;hed to be alone with me; the girl withdrew, and with much he&s;i|tation and vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, &s;he began, &s;aying; the di&s;covery I had made the day before, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her more than &s;he would expre&s;s, le&s;t I &s;hould imagine her re&s;erve proceeded from want of confidence in my affection for her, which &s;he earne&s;tly a&s;|&s;ured me, was not the ca&s;e: &s;he &s;hould think her&s;elf very ungrateful if it was. But indeed, cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing to death, the truth is, I could never get re|&s;olution enough to tell you.</P>
<P>I had 'entangled my&s;elf in &s;uch an af|fair while I was &s;o very young&mdash;Here I interrupted her, to clear my&s;elf of any de&s;ign, to pry into her &s;ecrets, and re|que&s;ted &s;he would not think her&s;elf under any obligation to di&s;clo&s;e them, if it gave her the lea&s;t pain. She knew me too well not to be convinced I &s;poke truth; but
<PB N="42" REF="42">&s;aid, &s;he had long wi&s;hed to break it to me, and now, that accident had done that for her, &s;he would take the opportunity of opening her whole mind to me.</P>
<P>You already know my aunt St. George's ill health obliged her to re&s;ide above two years at Montpelier; during that time, Gertrude contracted an intimacy with a young lady of her own age, daugh|ter to the Count de Rou&s;&s;illon, who&s;e chatteau was in the neighbourhood. Her mother al&s;o became acquainted with the Count and Counte&s;s, who were very po|lite, and even friendly to any genteel &s;trangers, who frequented the town: our friends received uncommon civilities from them; for they in&s;i&s;ted on their pa&s;&s;ing great part of their time with them, which made their &s;tay very agreeable, e&s;pecially to Gertrude, who found a mo&s;t plea&s;ing companion in Mademoi&s;elle Adelaide; &s;he often heard the young Count mentioned in the family, particularly by his &s;i&s;ter, who &s;poke of him with all that fond par|tiality, which the ties of blood and af|fection are apt to create; and frequently wi&s;hed his return, that &s;he might intro|duce him to her pretty Iri&s;h woman, by
<PB N="43" REF="43">which appellation Gertrude was known at Montpellier: &s;he had been more than a year there, before the young gentleman, who was at the Military Academy, came home.</P>
<P>He arrived one day, rather unexpected, and a me&s;&s;enger was immediately di&s;|patched to bring my aunt and cou&s;in to the Chatteau, to rejoice with the family on the occa&s;ion. Adelaide pre&s;ented Ger|trude to him, with a thou&s;and kind ex|pre&s;&s;ions in her favour; and told him, &s;he loved her better than any woman in the world: a French man could not &s;ay le&s;s than, he would love her as well as &s;he did, which was really the an&s;wer he made: and it &s;eems it was prophetic; for he ve|ry &s;oon &s;hewed an attachment to her, but it pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, as it would there be thought unpolite in a young man, not to behave with &s;ome degree of gallantry to a girl, who was &s;o often at the hou&s;e He was only a year older than his &s;i&s;ter, and there was a remarkable &s;imilitude both in their per&s;ons and di&s;po&s;itions, which was exceedingly amiable: the fir&s;t created admitation, the latter e&s;teem. No wonder, the unguarded heart of my young cou&s;in, fell a victim to the charms
<PB N="44" REF="44">of mind and per&s;on, united in this agree|able foreigner, who&s;e con&s;tant &s;tudy it was to render him&s;elf plea&s;ing to her; and the perfect amity that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween him and his &s;i&s;ter, gave him con|tinual opportunities of recommending him&s;elf to her favour, in which, I find, he &s;ucceeded &s;o&punc; well, that when he de|clared his pa&s;&s;ion to her, &s;he was, before they parted, brought to acknowlege, &s;he would have no objection, if the con&s;ent of their parents could be obtained.</P>
<P>When &s;he related this circum&s;tance, &s;he &s;eemed a&s;hamed at having &s;o &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed her &s;entiments to him; but told me, it happened one evening that the beautiful &s;erenity of the &s;ky invited Adelaide and her to take their Guitars to a delightful arbour in the garden, by which a gentle rivulet murmured. There they were en|tertaining them&s;elves with &s;ome of David Rizzio's mo&s;t plaintive Scotch airs, when the young Count joined them: and while the plea&s;ing effects of the &s;oft melody was &s;till powerful in her heart, he made his declaration, and his &s;i&s;ter pleaded &s;o earne&s;tly in his favour, that &s;he could not refu&s;e to their joint &s;olicitations, the ac|knowlegement of &s;entiments which her
<PB N="45" REF="45">prudence told her &s;he &s;hould have con|cealed.</P>
<P>The old gentleman having an employ|ment at court, was then attending the King at Ver&s;ailles, and the young folks agreed, not to mention it to their mo|thers, till his return, when his &s;on was to a&s;k his approbation, which he had no idea would be refu&s;ed, as Gertrude was a great favourite with him, and her fortune and connexions were &s;uch, as he could not object to.</P>
<P>Their time rolled on in uninterrupted &s;cenes of happine&s;s and content during three months that the Count remained at court; but his return da&s;hed all their pro&s;pects of felicity; and the di&s;appoint|ment was the more &s;en&s;ibly felt, becau&s;e it was unexpected. It was, however, a cha&s;ti&s;ement they in &s;ome mea&s;ure de|&s;erved, for allowing their affections to be &s;o &s;trongly engaged, before they knew that their parents would approve it.</P>
<P>Louis (that was the youth's name) could not mention it to his father, the day he came home, but determined he would de|fer it no longer than the morning. That
<PB N="46" REF="46">evening the Count &s;ent for him to his &s;tudy, and after informing him, he was appointed to a company in the Count D'Artois' regiment, &s;aid, he had &s;till bet|ter news, which was, he had agreed with the Marquis de Bretagne, to conclude a marriage between him and that noble|man's only daughter; who, as he knew, was a mo&s;t amiable young lady, the King him&s;elf had been &s;o kind to propo&s;e it, and the Marquis and he had joyfully con&s;ented to it, as it would be a &s;till &s;tronger cement to the friend&s;hip that had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was like a thunder clap to the young Count; and for &s;ome mi|nutes totally deprived him of utterance; during which time his father went on, enumerating the many advantages that would attend his alliance with a family &s;o powerful at court, not to &s;peak of the fortune &s;he would bring him, which was much larger than his e&s;tate, (though a good one,) entitled him to expect; and concluded, by bidding him prepare to &s;et out for Ver&s;ailles in two days to make his acknowlegements to his Maje&s;ty for his goodne&s;s to him, as well in that affair, as in promoting him, before he had ever
<PB N="47" REF="47">joined his regiment; (for it &s;eems he has had a commi&s;&s;ion &s;ince ever he was born, which the late King, who was his god|father, pre&s;ented him with on that occa|&s;ion;) and al&s;o, to pay his compliments to the young lady; for they meant to celebrate the marriage as &s;oon as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary preparations could be made.</P>
<P>By that time the old gentleman had cea&s;ed &s;peaking, his &s;on had recovered the u&s;e of his &s;peech, and ventured to &s;ay, he was &s;orry they had gone &s;o far, before they knew that the young lady would be di&s;po&s;ed to accept of him; and hinted the difference of religion, as an objection to the match; for his family are Prote&s;|tants; but his father who could not bear the lea&s;t contradiction, flew in a violent pa&s;&s;ion at his rai&s;ing any difficulty, and told him, the thing was determined, and nothing &s;hould make him recede from his word, or affront the Marquis, by menti|oning &s;uch a frivolous ob&s;tacle: and &s;tern|ly ordering him to take care that he ac|quitted him&s;elf properly in his addre&s;&s;es to the lady, he flung out of the room, and left poor Louis in a &s;tate of mind not be de&s;cribed. Unable to fix on any rule of conduct for him&s;elf, he went to his
<PB N="48" REF="48">&s;i&s;ter's apartment, to whom he related the cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s. Adelaide, who ten|derly loved her brother, and had a &s;incere affection for Gertrude, was much affected at the di&s;appointment of their fond hopes, but too well knew her father's determined temper, to hope to move him, by telling him the true &s;tate of his &s;on's heart, which &s;he judged would at pre&s;ent only ex|a&s;perate him; &s;he therefore advi&s;ed he &s;hould carefully conceal it from every one, but the young lady her&s;elf, to whom he &s;hould reveal it in confidence; and if &s;he de&s;erved half the prai&s;es &s;he had heard given her, &s;he would &s;pare him the inde|licacy of refu&s;ing her, as well as the pain of di&s;obliging his father. She was &s;ur|prized he made light of the difference of religion, becau&s;e he was &s;trongly attached to his own, and &s;aid, &s;he thought it an un|&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle, even if his heart had no pre-engagement: he a&s;&s;ured her, he did not mention it merely to rai&s;e an objection, but becau&s;e it was his &s;enti|ments; that people of different per&s;ua|&s;ions could not be happy in marriage, as the education of their children would be a continual &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s; and as Mademoi&s;elle was reckoned very &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="49" REF="49">he had hopes &s;he would be of the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>He then reque&s;ted his &s;i&s;ter would break the matter to Gertrude, in the be&s;t man|ner &s;he could, and procure him an inter|view with her the next day; &s;he promi&s;ed to do &s;o, and having con&s;oled him greatly by her conver&s;ation, he retired from her apartment, much more compo&s;ed than when he entered it.</P>
<P>Next day Adelaide ordered her carri|age, &s;aying, &s;he would call on Gertrude to take an airing with her, which &s;he of|ten did, and the Counte&s;s bid her engage Mrs. St. George too, to come and &s;pend the day with them, which &s;he accordingly did: and my aunt having &s;ome morning vi&s;itors, promi&s;ed to be at the chatteau by the time they returned from their air|ing. Adelaide, who was well plea&s;ed &s;he did not offer to go with them, as &s;oon as &s;he found her&s;elf alone with Gertrude, informed her as cautiou&s;ly as &s;he could, of what had pa&s;&s;ed between Louis and his father, and will all the tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip, pointed out to her, the rea&s;on they had to expect the lady would refu&s;e him; but to prevent her being any way
<PB N="50" REF="50">alarmed, a&s;&s;ured her, from her brother, that though he held him&s;elf bound by duty, not to marry without his father's con&s;ent, nothing could ever prevail on him to think of any other woman.</P>
<P>Gertrude &s;ays, &s;he received this intel|ligence with more fortitude than &s;he thought &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; but the truth is, her pride was hurt, that any man &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal his attachment to her: &s;he therefore told Adelaide, it would give her much con|cern to be the cau&s;e of any mi&s;under|&s;tanding between the Count and his &s;on, to prevent which, &s;he would advi&s;e him to marry the lady that was cho&s;e for him. As for her, &s;he never would have encou|raged his addre&s;&s;es, had &s;he thought it pro|bable there could be any objection; but &s;ince there was, her rank in life &s;et her above forcing her&s;elf into any family again&s;t their con&s;ent; (are not you proud of her &s;pirit?)</P>
<P>Adelaide &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at her man|ner of receiving news which &s;he thought would greatly affect her; but no doubt, quickly penetrating into the real cau&s;e, &s;he took her hand, and &s;aid, my dear Gertrude intirely mi&s;con&s;trues my meaning; I can
<PB N="51" REF="51">&s;afely affirm, that every one of our fami|ly would think them&s;elves honoured by a connexion with you: the misfortune lies in my brother not having declared his attachment to you before my father went to Paris; he left home &s;uppo&s;ing his &s;on's heart di&s;engaged; and, at the King's de&s;ire agreed to marry him to the daugh|ter of his deare&s;t friend; that, &s;urely, can|not be looked on as an affront to you. I acknowledge my father's fault is ob&s;tinacy, he never will retract from a re&s;olution once taken, and expects unlimited obe|dience from his children, in &s;uch a ca&s;e. Your own good &s;en&s;e will &s;hew you the impropriety of mentioning the affair to him now; e&s;pecially when we have fixed on a &s;cheme very likely to &s;ucceed, with|out provoking my father. Let me then be&s;eech you, not to add to the inquietude my poor brother labours under, by ex|pre&s;&s;ing a di&s;plea&s;ure he really does not de&s;erve from you.</P>
<P>Gertrude, who could not but a&s;&s;ent to the truth of what Adelaide &s;aid, promi&s;ed &s;he would not; but was determined in her own mind, not to be prevailed on to enter into any private engagement with him, which &s;he doubted not he would
<PB N="52" REF="52">propo&s;e at the interview &s;he had con&s;ented to give him. It being near dinner-time, they returned to the Chatteau, where they found my aunt and a widow lady of the neighbourhood. The day pa&s;&s;ed off not &s;o agreeable as u&s;ual; for the Counte&s;s and Adelaide were low-&s;pirited at parting with Louis &s;o &s;oon; and he and Gertrude, you may think, could not be very lively: &s;o that my aunt and the other lady were the only unconcerned per&s;ons, and kept the re&s;t from being quite &s;ilent. After they had taken their coffee, the three old ladies and the Count &s;at down to qua|drille, and the three young folks went into the garden, and entering their fa|vourite arbour, &s;at down to enjoy the plea&s;|ing &s;cene, and li&s;ten to the &s;weet warbling of an infinite variety of birds, that inhabit|ed the trees around them: the &s;oft notes charmed them for a while to &s;ilence; but the young Count could not long defer the &s;ubject next his heart; and told his tale &s;o pathetically, that Gertrude could with difficulty refu&s;e a promi&s;e he endeavoured to draw from her; but &s;he thought it too humiliating to engage her&s;elf to wait for a man, who&s;e father would, perhaps, ne|ver con&s;ent to their union. She, there|fore,
<PB N="53" REF="53">did refu&s;e it, though he &s;olemnly &s;wore, never to marry any other woman, while &s;he remained &s;ingle.</P>
<P>She had intended to return his picture, and demand her's which he had, [they were both of his own drawing [but his di&s;traction was &s;o great at parting with her, that &s;he thought it &s;hould be barba|rous to mention it; and I dare &s;ay, was well plea&s;ed to have any excu&s;e for keep|ing the dear re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>The farewel was, no doubt, very ten|der on his &s;ide; and, I believe, a little &s;o on hers', notwith&s;tanding all her di&s;|cretion. However, upon the whole, &s;he certainly behaved heroically, if we con|&s;ider her youth, for &s;he was but fifteen; and that &s;he really loved the man, his merit and the pains he took to win her heart, is &s;ufficient apology. She deter|mined not to tell her mother, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be unea&s;y on her account, and &s;he had come to a re&s;olution, not to let it prey on her &s;pirits, but wait patiently to &s;ee how matters would turn out.&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;et off with his father very early the next morning, and the fir&s;t account
<PB N="54" REF="54">&s;he had from him, was in a letter to his &s;i&s;ter, wherein he informed her, he had waited on the lady, but had no oca&s;ion to make her his-confidant, for knowing the motive of his vi&s;it, &s;he, with a plea&s;ing frankne&s;s, told him, he might &s;pare him|&s;elf the trouble of declaring it, for there was an in&s;uperable objection to their uni|on; which was, his Religion. She had been educated in a Convent, where &s;he had imbibed all the uncharitable doctrines of Popery: and &s;aid, &s;he hoped he could not take it ami&s;s if &s;he told him, &s;he could not think of ri&s;king her &s;alvation by marry|ing a Heretic; for in this ca&s;e, &s;he thought it be&s;t to &s;peak plain, that he might know her re&s;olution was fixed.</P>
<P>He &s;aid all that was proper on the occa|&s;ion, and left her with a heart quite at ea&s;e; but found it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal his &s;atisfaction, when he came into his father's pre&s;ence, to whom he related her an&s;wer. The Count had &s;carce patience to hear him out; taking it for granted, the fault was intirely his, as he had, at fir&s;t mention of the affair, made that objection. He was in an ab&s;olute rage; and though Louis gave him all the a&s;&s;urances po&s;&s;ible, that the lady had pronounced her refu&s;al before
<PB N="55" REF="55">he had well &s;poke, it was to no purpo&s;e. He forbid him to appear in his &s;ight; and next day &s;ent him an order from the King to repair to his regiment, and not pre&s;ume to leave it without his Maje&s;ty's particular permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was then preparing to obey this un|welcome command; and as it was very uncertain when he &s;hould be able to plead his own cau&s;e, he reque&s;ted his &s;i&s;ter to be his advocate with her fair friend, and if po&s;&s;ible, to keep up an intere&s;t for him in her heart.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after wrote to her under cover to his &s;i&s;ter, which he &s;till continues to do, though &s;he never an&s;wers his letters, ex|cept by me&s;&s;ages in tho&s;e &s;he writes to Adelaide.</P>
<P>I have &s;een his letters; they are &s;en&s;ible and well-wrote, but full of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;io|nate exclamations, with which FRENCH love-letters always abound, but which in our language &s;ounds very ill; at lea&s;t I think, Ah! Oh! and Alas! have a mighty bad effect in an Engli&s;h letter. But to proceed with my &s;tory: the war breaking out, my aunt determined to &s;et out for
<PB N="56" REF="56">Ireland, and Gertrude did not at all regret quitting France, as the Counte&s;s and Ade|laide were &s;oon to go to Paris, where the Count's employment obliged him to re&s;ide during the war. The parting was very painful to the young friends, who promi&s;|ed a mutual corre&s;pondence, as often as opportunity would permit: and it is &s;till continued, though Adelaide was married very &s;oon after &s;he went to Paris, to a man of large fortune, M. de St. Veriolle. Her father's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t his &s;on, is not yet removed, nor can they prevail on him to get leave for him to come home to &s;ee them before the regiment embarks, which is now under orders for America.</P>
<P>Though Gertrude would not give him a promi&s;e, I believe he is quite as &s;ecure of her as if &s;he had, for &s;he is now her own mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eems not the lea&s;t inclined to encourage any other. She never told her mother a word of it; indeed it was u&s;ele&s;s to give her any di&s;quiet about it; as the cold &s;he got on her journey occa&s;ioned &s;uch a rapid decline of her health, (before very precarious) that as you know, &s;he did not &s;urvive above two months after her coming home.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="57">
<P>Having always lived with my father, &s;ince her widowhood, and after his death with me, &s;he reque&s;ted Gertrude &s;hould remain in my hou&s;e till &s;he was married, if agreeable to us both, which &s;he hoped it would be; for though Gertrude was by her father's will to be of age at &s;ixteen, yet &s;he thought that too young for a girl to be left to her own direction, and as I was a few years older, and had more ex|perience, &s;he wi&s;hed Gertrude would be always advi&s;ed by me, who&s;e affection for her, &s;he was &s;ure, &s;he might depend upon. You know it has been my &s;tudy to make her happy: I thought her rather &s;erious for her age; and wondered &s;he had not got &s;ome of the French vivacity, as &s;he went a|mong&s;t them while a child. I did not then &s;u&s;pect her heart had learned a le&s;&s;on which is apt to give a thoughtful turn to the mo&s;t &s;prightly temper.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed very apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing my good opinion, by informing me of this affair, as &s;he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible her conduct in it, would not bear to be &s;cru|tinized by any unprejudiced per&s;on. I freely blamed her for giving him any en|couragement, without fir&s;t acquainting her,
<PB N="58" REF="58">mother, and bid her ob&s;erve, that all the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had &s;uffered &s;ince, was in con&s;equence of that one deviation from the path of duty; had they both con&s;ulted their parents in proper time, it is mo&s;t probable there would have been no ob&s;ta|cle to their happine&s;s. I prai&s;ed her, however, for her di&s;cretion in the other circum&s;tances, particularly refu&s;ing to con|tract her&s;elf to him; and &s;he was quite happy that I approved any part of her conduct. I hope you will acknowlege your&s;elf under uncommon obligations to me, for &s;itting up half a night to write a love-tale for you. I now leave you to read it, for my eyes are ju&s;t clo&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. Mi&s;s FITZGERALD, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 20. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t received my dear Loui&s;a's packet of the 17th In&s;t. and do indeed acknowlege my&s;elf much obliged to you, for &s;acrificing a night's re&s;t to gratify my curio&s;ity. Could I have had a notion the &s;tory would run to &s;uch a length, I &s;hould not have been &s;o unrea&s;onable as to a&s;k you to communicate it, but I thought it was &s;omething that had lately occurred, and would be related in a few lines. In|&s;tead of that, it is quite a little novel; and has afforded me an hour's plea&s;ing amu&s;ement. I &s;incerely hope it may end happily for Gertrude and her agreeable French-man.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations were very ju&s;t: &s;he was certainly wrong in concealing it from her mother at fir&s;t; however, I could make a thou&s;and excu&s;es for her, and to tell truth, I fear had I been in her &s;ituation, I
<PB N="60" REF="60">&s;hould not have been above half &s;o prudent. I think &s;he mu&s;t have had an uncommon &s;hare of re&s;olution to refu&s;e his reque&s;t at their la&s;t meeting: but no doubt, being &s;o nearly related, &s;he has a tincture of your philo&s;ophy: nothing le&s;s could enable her to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of the man &s;he loved, when con&s;i&s;tent with virtue. I own it was perfectly pru|dent; and I think &s;he de&s;erves great prai&s;e for it. But you will grant it requires a degree of fortitude &s;eldom to be met with in &s;o young a per&s;on, to act up to our du|ty in every re&s;pect, on an occa&s;ion where the heart is &s;o much concerned. For my part, I am thankful I never had any &s;uch trials. As I have great doubts of my&s;elf, for I know I am but too &s;u&s;ceptible of ten|derne&s;s, though I hoped no one had made the ob&s;ervation but you, who are acquaint|ed with the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my mind; for though I have been &s;o fortunate as to place my affections ju&s;t where my friends wi&s;hed, I &s;hould be &s;orry to deviate from the paths of delicacy in my behaviour; which I really think would be the ca&s;e if my attachment to Mr. Skeffington was vi|&s;ible to &s;trangers: but I flatter my&s;elf, Gertrude being an adept her&s;elf, has more denetration in the&s;e matters than the ge|nerality
<PB N="61" REF="61">of people. I am &s;atisfied at her di&s;covering my &s;u&s;ceptibility, as it procur|ed me her confidence; and &s;he may be &s;ure, I &s;hall make all the allowance for her weakne&s;s (if it de&s;erves that name) which I &s;hould hope for my&s;elf in like ca&s;e; be|ing in &s;ome-what of &s;imilar circum&s;tances, u&s;ually makes one follow the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, of doing as we would be done by; though I am &s;orry to &s;ay, we are but too apt to forget that be&s;t of all Rules, where we do not think the &s;ituation is ever likely to be our own.</P>
<P>Be &s;ure inform me whenever there is news from France; for I &s;hall long to hear if the Count lets his &s;on go to America without &s;eeing him: if he does, I &s;hall hate him, it will betray &s;uch a want of paternal affection.</P>
<P>Tell Gertrude, when I go to town I will expect to &s;ee the letters, now that we are all En Confidance; I dare &s;ay you mu&s;t both have felt aukward enough, when you made the unexpected di&s;covery; though &s;he that is &s;o well acquainted with your di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t at once acquit you of any de&s;ign to pry into her &s;ecrets: but accident &s;ometimes leads one into &s;ituati|ons
<PB N="62" REF="62">extremely di&s;agreeable, and which makes one &s;eem to them&s;elves as if they had done wrong, though con&s;cious they did not mean it &s;o; which I am &s;ure was altogether your ca&s;e. The accident will be of u&s;e to Gertrude, for now the ice is broke, &s;he will not be a&s;hamed to con&s;ult you on the affair, when &s;he has occa&s;ion for advice. After the hint you had given me, I &s;hould have &s;carce admitted your qualm of con&s;cience as an excu&s;e for with|holding the re&s;t of the &s;tory; &s;o you did well to get permi&s;&s;ion to tell it; yet I mu&s;t acknowlege, that without that permi&s;&s;ion, you had no right to divulge it; and there was no fear but you could recollect that, for I never knew you to deviate from the right path: or if you did, it was but mo|mentary, and you recovered your &s;tep im|mediately. Why do not I always think &s;o ju&s;tly? e&s;pecially when your example has been continually before me; for you have acted according to the rule of right, as long as I have remembered you; at lea&s;t as long as I have been capable of judging.&mdash;</P>
<P>You did not mention Emily in your la&s;t, nor cou&s;in James, but once &s;ince he went to town; he writes to Charles often, but
<PB N="63" REF="63">their corre&s;pondence is chiefly on political affairs; &s;o we have all that &s;ort of news from him. I need not tell you he is a &s;taunch patriot; indeed I hope none of my family will ever be otherwi&s;e, for there is &s;omething &s;o unnatural in de&s;erting the intere&s;t of our country, that I could not have a good opinion of any one that was guilty of it; be&s;ides, it is &s;uch a mean|ne&s;s of &s;pirit in a man of family, to &s;ub|mit to be made the tool of any Admini|&s;tration, that I could not help de&s;pi&s;ing &s;uch a one, if he was my brother; I think the King cannot confer any honour equal to that of being an hone&s;t man, and a &s;teady patriot: Court favours are no long|er&punc; de&s;irable when they cea&s;e to be the reward of merit; Charles is of the &s;ame opinion; &s;o I do not fear he will be di&s;|graced by any when he is a Senator.</P>
<P>I have often wondered what could be the rea&s;on that the very young ladies of this age were &s;o amazingly undaunted when fir&s;t brought into company, but I did not then know it was a &s;cience they were made to &s;tudy under their dancing-ma&s;ters; I am obliged to you for the in|formation, for while I thought it was na|tural to them, I cannot but &s;ay, it gave
<PB N="64" REF="64">me very great di&s;gu&s;t; now I know it is acquired, I am in hopes &s;ome of them may have a little mode&s;ty in their hearts, though they are a&s;hamed to &s;hew it. But I agree with you, that taking pains to eradicate the natural ba&s;hfulne&s;s of the &s;ex may be of very bad con&s;equence to their virtue; and certainly a girl that keeps genteel company, will of cour&s;e learn an ea&s;y behaviour, without being taught an impudent &s;tare.</P>
<P>What a pretty picture you have drawn of ignorant women, and a very ju&s;t one too; it brought fre&s;h to my memory &s;ome ladies of our acquaintance, who are, I think, the originals from which your piece is taken: I vi&s;it them as &s;eldom as I can, becau&s;e I am &s;ure to be entertained with nothing el&s;e but the carele&s;sne&s;s of their waiting-maid, and the wit of their chil|dren: now, though I will allow the little creature's prattle may be perfectly enter|taining to a parent, or even to a &s;tranger if they were pre&s;ent, it will very &s;eldom bear a repetition: however, I mu&s;t ac|knowlege it is generally as &s;en&s;ible as any thing the mother could &s;ay; for a woman who&s;e mind is uncultivated, &s;carce ever &s;ays any thing to the purpo&s;e. You are
<PB N="65" REF="65">rather &s;evere on the men who marry &s;uch women, yet there is no other way of ac|counting for their choice; and I have of|ten ob&s;erved, that men would rather pa&s;s their time with the meere&s;t trifler of our &s;ex than with a girl who is reckoned &s;en&s;i|ble, and has read a good deal; which is no great credit to their under&s;tanding, and a clear proof of their incon&s;i&s;tency; for they are ever accu&s;ing us of neglecting to improve our minds; yet where mental ac|compli&s;hments are to be found, they &s;eem afraid of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. I am come to the end of my paper before I ob&s;erved it, and have only room to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. Mi&s;s MORTIMER, to Mi&s;s FITZGERALD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 24. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL now be more punctual in an|&s;wering my dear Eliza's letters than I have been hitherto, for as Emily will be with me &s;ome time, I &s;hall not think it nece&s;&s;ary to confine my&s;elf to her &s;o much as while I thought her &s;tay would be very &s;hort; and &s;he has reque&s;ted I would not u&s;e any ceremony with her, indeed I ne|ver meant it in that light, but gave up my time to her purely to enjoy as much of her company as I could, becau&s;e &s;he meant to &s;tay but two or three weeks; it is now probable you will find her in Dub|lin when you come, for her father and mother are coming up.</P>
<P>Mr. O'Neil had lately a &s;udden attack of the gout in his &s;tomach, it was &s;oon remov|ed, but has alarmed him &s;o much, that he is coming to town for advice, and will &s;tay the winter, for fear of a return of his com|plaint: there is not a good phy&s;ician with|in
<PB N="67" REF="67">many miles of his hou&s;e, and only there was one attending at a neighbour's when he was taken ill, he might have died before he could get help: he never thought of that inconvenience while he was in health, but with the fear of death before his eyes, it appears very terrible to him.</P>
<P>Emily has taken lodgings for them ve|ry near us, it was a hou&s;e he de&s;ired, but all the furni&s;hed hou&s;es were &s;et,&mdash;which &s;he is not &s;orry for, becau&s;e &s;he could not have excu&s;ed her&s;elf from &s;taying with them if they had room for her, and &s;he would much rather be with me, though no child can be fonder of parents than &s;he is, but her father has &s;ome particulari|ties, that makes it not plea&s;ing to live with him; &s;uch as going to bed at ten o'clock, and expecting all his family to do the &s;ame; at lea&s;t they mu&s;t be at home at that hour, and cannot have company after it, as the doors are then locked, and the keys taken to his room. He makes no allowance for the alteration of cu&s;|toms and manners &s;ince he was a young man; &s;o if his daughter was with him, &s;he could neither pay nor receive any but morning vi&s;its, unle&s;s &s;he could pre|vail on the people to dine and &s;up at the &s;ame hours they did forty years ago.</P>
<PB N="68" REF="68">
<P>Mr. O'Neil was an old batchelor when he married, and had got &s;everal oddities, (as people who live alone are apt to do) which he &s;till retains, for his wife, though a very young woman, accommodated her|&s;elf to his ways, by which means he ne|ver was broke off them, as it is likely he would have been, had &s;he gone a little more into the gay world; but &s;he was ju&s;t the gentle temper of Emily, and feared even a grave look; it was all &s;he had to fear, for he was not an ill-tempered man, as I have heard my father &s;ay, who blamed her for not bringing him off the&s;e peculi|arities which makes men di&s;agreeable that would otherwi&s;e be very plea&s;ing. If ever I marry an old batchelor, I &s;hall take pains to make him as plea&s;ing as I can.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erved I did not mention Emily, I hope you are &s;atisfied now I have filled half my paper about her and her family. As to your cou&s;in James, I knew he wrote to Mr. Skeffington, and concluded you mu&s;t know more of him than I could, though he often favours me with his com|pany, and I am always glad to &s;ee him, for I do not put him on a footing with &s;ome others that vi&s;it me, becau&s;e one gets
<PB N="69" REF="69">both information and entertainment from his conver&s;ation. If I am any judge in the&s;e matters, his heart is not quite &s;o whole as when he came to town, not that he has given the &s;malle&s;t hint to the con|trary; but his behaviour to Mrs. Roch|ford &s;hews it very plain: the minute at|tentions, or as the French expre&s;s it, LE PETIT SOINS, are never thought of but by a lover. Any man of politene&s;s will think of all the civilities which they know we expect from them; but none but a man in love will think of attending to every trifling circum&s;tance that may oc|cur. I never yet found my&s;elf mi&s;taken in the ob&s;ervation; however, I would not have you mention it to Charles, le&s;t he &s;hould hint it to Mr. Fitzgerald, who would know you had it from me, and there would be an indelicacy in it's coming from her friends: I would not caution you about it, only I know, you think Charles is all di&s;cretion, and to be intru&s;t|ed with any &s;ecret; but I know the men all tell each other tho&s;e fort of &s;ecrets.&mdash; I have teized Emily a good deal on the &s;ubject, but &s;he affects not to perceive his attachment; and when I tell her that is only to make him &s;peak plain, &s;he
<PB N="70" REF="70">prims and looks &s;o matronly, and &s;o di&s;|creet, that I am obliged to be &s;ilent. She certainly, does not di&s;like him; but I am convinced &s;he would not at pre&s;ent li&s;ten to any man on that &s;ubject; &s;he has too ju&s;t notions of propriety: be&s;ides her un|happine&s;s in marriage is &s;o recent in her memory, that I think &s;he will con&s;ider well, before &s;he enters into the &s;tate again; was I in her place, I &s;hould have got a compleat &s;urfeit.</P>
<P>I cannot accept of your compliment, becau&s;e I feel I am by no means the per|fect creature which your partial friend|&s;hip has de&s;cribed me; though I am &s;ure you only &s;ay what you have per&s;uaded your&s;elf to think; it does not, however, require &s;uch a &s;hare of philo&s;ophy as you &s;eem to imagine, to enable us to controul our pa&s;&s;ions when we are accu&s;tomed to to give way to them, in oppo&s;ition to our rea&s;on; and I think my&s;elf infinitely ob|liged to my parents, for teaching me to curb them before they grew ungoverna|ble: &s;o that what you call philo&s;ophy, is purely the effects of a proper education, enforced, I acknowlege, by religious mo|tives, &s;ince I have been capable of com|prehending them; for though I am of a
<PB N="71" REF="71">very chearful turn of mind, I can think &s;eriou&s;ly on &s;ubjects of importance.</P>
<P>Gertrude is highly flattered by your approbation, and &s;ays, &s;he begins to be better reconciled to her&s;elf, &s;ince you and I think her conduct excu&s;able. She bids me tell you, &s;he will let you &s;ee the let|ters when you come to town, and all that &s;he may yet receive from the Count; &s;he expects to hear &s;oon, as he will certainly write before he goes to America.</P>
<P>Harry Maun&s;el &s;urpri&s;ed us ju&s;t as we &s;at down to tea la&s;t night, I did not ex|pect him, for I had a letter from his &s;i&s;|ter very lately, which mentioned his in|tention of going to Corke on bu&s;ine&s;s; but it &s;eems &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion has brought him to Dublin; and he &s;ays, will detain him great part of the winter. I find Charles and he corre&s;pond, and by &s;ome words he let fall, I am &s;ure he has mentioned his unea&s;ine&s;s about Mr. Ha|milton to him; if &s;o, it is probable we &s;hall di&s;cover his real &s;entiments, and whether, as you think, his rea&s;on has con|quered his jealou&s;ly; but as yet, I have no time to enter into a conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="72">
<P>Harry, who has not &s;een Mrs. Roch|fort &s;ince &s;he was with me, a year before her marriage, was &s;o &s;truck with the loveline&s;s of her countenance and figure, that I had &s;ome hopes &s;he would rival me, and ob&s;erved him clo&s;ely to &s;ee if it was &s;o, but have rea&s;on to think his admiration was nothing more than the plea&s;ing effect which the fir&s;t view of &s;omething very beautiful always has on the mind, but which, as it grows familiar to the &s;ight, cea&s;es to attract the attention. You will think it an odd expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;ay, I had hopes of being rivalled; however, for his &s;ake, I &s;incerely wi&s;h it had been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Is Charles as great a book-worm as ever? You &s;hould endeavour to wean him a little from his &s;tudies, as he is not to follow any profe&s;&s;ion; it is high time he &s;hould &s;tudy the manners of the world, which he is really too ignorant of. I &s;hall talk to Henry about giving him a little advice on that head, now I find there is &s;uch an intimacy between them.</P>
<P>Gertrude begs you will not make your|&s;elf unea&s;y at what &s;he &s;aid of your &s;u&s;|ceptibility;
<PB N="73" REF="73">for though that is very per|ceptible, your delicacy remains unim|peached, in which opinion I join, and think you a good, decent behaved girl, notwith&s;tanding you are a perfect turtle in love and con&s;tancy. I wonder how it is that Charles and you have continued to like each other &s;o long; it &s;eldom happens that a fancy of that kind, taken in child|hood, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts when the parties grow up: be&s;ides, from the manner you were rear|ed together, I am &s;urpri&s;ed you did not rather mi&s;take each other for brother and &s;i&s;ter. Was I in your place, I &s;hould be a little afraid the whole &s;tock of tender|ne&s;s on both &s;ides, would be exhau&s;ted before marriage; if it is not, I can only &s;ay you have an amazing fund of it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Chri&s;tmas was over, that you might come to town; and on con&s;iderati|on I do not &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity there was for your going almo&s;t two months before, that you might be there at the time; but Mrs. Fitzgerald is &s;o methodical, &s;he does not like to break through old cu&s;toms, and it is very fit you &s;hould comply with her inclinations, her actions are always go|verned by &s;ome laudable motive.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="74">
<P>What a long epi&s;tle here is, with little or nothing in it; however, as I am in a &s;cribling vein, it is likely it would be &s;till longer, but luckily for you, who will have the fatigue of reading it, I mu&s;t break off, for your cou&s;in James and Harry Maun|&s;ell, are to gallant Gertrude and I to the play; and it is ju&s;t tea-time, no doubt they will &s;oon be here.. Emily &s;pent the day at her aunt's, you may think &s;he does not as yet go to any public place, which has confined me a great deal. Our beaux are arrived; have only time to &s;ay, I am,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 25. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR ELIZA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Conver&s;ation I had with Harry Maun&s;ell this Morning, determined me to write directly, though I had di&s;|patched a letter to you by la&s;t night's po&s;t; but as I think I have &s;omething in|tere&s;ting to &s;ay, I would not delay it a moment.</P>
<P>Harry was with me all the forenoon, and Emily and Gertrude being out &s;hop|ing, I had an opportunity to &s;peak to him about the hint he dropt in regard to Mr. Hamilton. He immediately told me all he knew of the matter; he had it from Mr. Skeffington; and taking a letter out of his pocket, gave it to me to read. When I had fini&s;hed, I went for your fir&s;t letter, and read the account you gave me of the affair; then ob&s;erving to him, how nece&s;&s;ary it was to your happine&s;s to
<PB N="76" REF="76">be acquainted with Charles's real &s;enti|ments upon the occa&s;ion; obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion to take a copy of it for your peru|&s;al. Nothing but that con&s;ideration could have tempted him to give it; but I a&s;|&s;ured him, he might rely on your di&s;cre|tion, that you would de&s;troy it as &s;oon as read: you will ea&s;ily &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o doing, and here you &s;hall have the copy.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Ca&s;tle-Skeffington, <DATE>Nov. 10.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR MAUNSELL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE left Dublin on the 4th, as I in|formed you we &s;hould, and ar|rived in due time; but met with an ad|venture on the road, which has rou&s;ed a latent &s;park of jealou&s;y in my bo&s;om, and given me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, that I could not &s;ufficiently compo&s;e my mind to write to you &s;ooner; though I never had more occa&s;ion for your coun&s;el.</P>
<P>A Mr. Hamilton of the county of Der|ry joined us on the la&s;t night of our jour|ney; he is, I mu&s;t acknowledge, a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young man. Being lately returned from his travels, the conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="77" REF="77">turned on the manners and cu&s;toms of the places he had vi&s;ited, which he de&s;cribed with &s;o much under&s;tanding, and elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, that my aunt was delighted, and Eliza quite charmed, which gave me pangs I never felt before, and ca&s;t &s;uch a damp on my &s;pirits, that I was incapable of taking any part in the conver&s;ation: every word &s;he addre&s;&s;ed to him was a dagger to my heart, and the particular attention he paid her, added to my unea&s;ine&s;s; for his per&s;on is really faultle&s;s, and his addre&s;s perfectly plea&s;|ing; attractions &s;ufficient to gain any wo|man, and alarm any man that loves as I do, and is not very partial to his own merit.</P>
<P>When he retired, the ladies were lavi&s;h in his prai&s;e, and Eliza ob&s;erved, what an advantage Travel was to young men of &s;en&s;e, as it enlarged their ideas, and gave them a knowledge of the world, which they could never obtain from books alone. As I took this ob&s;ervation to be intirely directed to me, who wanted that advantage, it confirmed my &s;u&s;picions, and increa&s;ed my ill temper; &s;o that my gloomine&s;s was, I am &s;ure, apparent, for I caught Eliza attentively looking at me
<PB N="78" REF="78">&s;everal times, and my aunt taking notice of my &s;ilence, I was forced to pretend a head-ach, on which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould go to bed, and ever attentive to my health, ordered whey and hart&s;horn to be given me; but knowing that was not a cure for my real complaint, you may gue&s;s I did not take it. I went to bed in a &s;tate of mind little &s;hort of di&s;traction, and lay cur&s;ing the whole fickle &s;ex and my own misfortune, in being &s;o &s;trongly attached to one of them, that I felt it impo&s;&s;ible to tear her from my heart. The agitation I endured, at la&s;t fatigued my &s;pirits, and threw me into a &s;ound &s;leep: when I a|woke, I found my&s;elf refre&s;hed and com|po&s;ed; and on revolving impartially, every circum&s;tance that had pa&s;&s;ed the preceding night, I was a&s;hamed to ac|knowlege to my&s;elf, that I had not any any one tolerable rea&s;on to a&s;&s;ign for the &s;u&s;picions that gave me &s;o much di&s;quiet. Convinced I had been in an error, I reco|vered my temper and my &s;pirits, and met the ladies in my u&s;ual manner: my aunt congratulated her&s;elf on the &s;ucce&s;s of her medicine, and Eliza, with a glow of plea&s;ure on her check, rejoiced I was &s;o much better.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="79">
<P>Mr. Hamilton breakfa&s;ted with us, and gave me a very genteel invitation to his hou&s;e, where he will be before Chri&s;tmas; he regretted much we were &s;o &s;oon to part, and when we were ready, handed Eliza to the carriage, and took leave with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch looks, as to me ap|peared a proof that &s;he had made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, which again di&s;|concerted me; but as &s;he remained quite chearful after he had left us, I cur&s;ed my ri&s;ing di&s;&s;atisfaction, to prevent her &s;u&s;|pecting the cau&s;e, but determined to take &s;ome method of di&s;covering her &s;entiments towards him: I abhor my&s;elf for the mean|ne&s;s this di&s;tracting pa&s;&s;ion made me com|mit. I que&s;tioned her maid, and even offered her money to betray her mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ecrets: &s;he &s;tedfa&s;tly denied ever hearing her mention Mr. Hamilton, except to her mother or me.</P>
<P>I &s;oon &s;aw the impropriety I had been guilty of, in expo&s;ing my weakne&s;s to this girl, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, &s;aying, I only wanted to try her integrity. This hap|pened early in the morning after our ar|rival, and when Eliza came down to breakfa&s;t, I gue&s;&s;ed from her &s;erious air,
<PB N="80" REF="80">when &s;he &s;poke to me, that her maid had informed her what pa&s;&s;ed between us, and I was &s;oon after convinced of it; for being di&s;appointed of a letter &s;he expected to receive from Mi&s;s Mortimer, I threw out &s;ome &s;arca&s;tical ob&s;ervations on female friend&s;hip and &s;incerity, at which &s;he im|mediately took fire, and expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with &s;o much warmth, that I who knew my&s;elf in fault, was glad to make an apology; and finding I could not bear her di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;pent the whole day in re|in&s;tating my&s;elf in her favour, which from her natural &s;weetne&s;s of temper, was not difficult to accompli&s;h; and we are now on as good terms as ever, but I can per|ceive &s;he watches me clo&s;ely when there is any young men here, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to penetrate into my heart, and &s;ee if jea|lou&s;y &s;till lurked there; however, none of our vi&s;itors rai&s;e any emotions of that kind in my bo&s;om, as I think they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s any &s;uperior degree of merit, and &s;he has, be&s;ide been acquainted with them from her infancy, but I cannot be &s;o ea&s;y in regard to Mr. Hamilton; for I feel that his pre&s;ence would quite de&s;troy my peace, yet I wi&s;hed they would meet again, that I might know my fate, for I cannot bear &s;u&s;pence, though I dread the certainty.
<PB N="81" REF="81">When &s;he is pre&s;ent my &s;u&s;picions vani&s;h, and I am happy; but the in&s;tant I am alone, all my doubts return. Do, dear Maun&s;ell, give me your advice and opi|nion. You that have loved, will, I am &s;ure, pity my anxiety, even though you may blame me.</P>
<P>I have thoughts of pre&s;&s;ing our marri|age, which is delayed till I am of age, on account of &s;ettlements; if &s;he confents, it will calm my fears, for I think I could not &s;u&s;pect her virtue if &s;he was my wife; but I &s;hall do nothing till I hear from you.</P>

</LETTER>
<PB N="82" REF="82">
<P>I believe this letter needs no comment to convince you, you were much deceived when you imagined he had conquered his foible; for it is plain, his good hu|mour depended on Mr. Hamilton's ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Perhaps Harry's arguments may by this time have had &s;ome effect on him; for he &s;ays, he placed the improbability of your giving him any cau&s;e of &s;u&s;pici|on in the &s;tronge&s;t light he could, and as it really appeared to him; but advi&s;ed him to make his promi&s;ed vi&s;it to Mr. Hamilton, and bring him to the ca&s;tle, that he might be certain he was cured of all doubts before he urged you to marry him; otherwi&s;e he would in&s;ure mi&s;ery both to him&s;elf and you.</P>
<P>In his an&s;wer to Harry, he &s;eemed a&s;hamed of his folly, and promi&s;ed to fol|low his advice; &s;o we mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend our judgment for a while: and I am more ea&s;y on that &s;ubject than I was, now I have a method of knowing his real &s;en|timents; for I was very apprehen&s;ive you would be too willing to tru&s;t to appearan|ces, and deceive your&s;elf into an opinion
<PB N="83" REF="83">that he was ju&s;t what you wi&s;hed him to be. He is in every other re&s;pect, a mo&s;t e&s;timable character, and wants only a lit|tle knowledge of the world to make him an accompli&s;hed young man.</P>
<P>I would, if I dare, advi&s;e his travelling for a couple of years, but I fear to give you pain by mentioning his ab&s;ence for &s;o long a time; however, if you cannot bring your|&s;elf to bear it, I would have you marry, and go abroad with him; I mean when you are quite convinced he is cured of this fooli&s;h imagination that has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him. Is it not very unaccountable, that he who is, on other occa&s;ions, rather too un|&s;u&s;pecting, &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly grow &s;u&s;|picious where he has lea&s;t cau&s;e? it mu&s;t proceed from too humble an opinion of him&s;elf; if you could in&s;pire him with but half &s;o high an idea of his own me|rit as mo&s;t young men have, he would never be jealous again, and that I believe is the only advantage that can &s;pring from &s;elf-conceit.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 28. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dear Loui&s;a's letters of the 24th and 25th, are now before me; and &s;hall begin with the latter, as it is wholly on a &s;ubject in which I am deeply inter|e&s;ted.</P>
<P>I was a good deal di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when I read the copy you &s;ent me, for I could no long|er doubt that I had been deceived in my hopes of his having laid a&s;ide his cau&s;ele&s;s jealou&s;y, which affected my &s;pirits not a little; and I &s;hould have been quite in the horrors, only I was obliged to exert my|&s;elf, being engaged to &s;pend the day at Mr. Boyle's, to take leave, as the whole family are going to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas with a &s;i&s;ter of his near Belfa&s;t, and the young ladies will go from that to Dublin with their aunt, to &s;tay the remainder of the winter. They will be a material lo&s;s to me while I am here. We pa&s;&s;ed the day &s;o agreeably, that my melancholy was in|&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="85" REF="85">di&s;pelled, and things appeared in a better light, for I then recollected that Mr. Maun&s;ell's advice and opinion had probably great weight with Charles, and would convince him of the folly of his &s;u&s;picions, and I had &s;ome rea&s;on to think it had; for I have lately been in company at Belle Park with &s;ome very accompli&s;hed young men that I was not acquainted with from my infancy, which Charles &s;eemed to lay a STRESS on, and he did not appear the lea&s;t di&s;concerted, though one of them paid all his attention to me, and I did not d&s;courage it, purely to try how Charles would bear it; it did not alarm him one bit, which I think a very good &s;ymptom: however, I &s;hall &s;oon be a better judge of the matter, for he had this morning a let|ter from Mr. Hamilton, reminding him of his promi&s;e, and appointing to meet him about twenty miles off, where he will be in two days, on his way home, and in&s;i&s;ts on Charles going with him. He &s;ays he will go, and &s;ent an an&s;wer to that pur|po&s;e by the &s;ervant; &s;o that he will cer|tainly meet him: but I find, he intends, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevail on Mr. Hamilton to come and &s;pend a few days here before he proceeds on his journey. I wi&s;h he may
<PB N="86" REF="86">come, as that would put us all out of &s;u&s;|pence, though I dread the certainty; for if the wor&s;t &s;hould happen, I fear I &s;hould but ill &s;upport my&s;elf. However, I will not anticipate misfortunes, as I think I have &s;ome rea&s;on to hope it will turn out well.</P>
<P>It is now time to return Mr Maun&s;ell thanks for permitting you to copy the let|ter for me: I &s;hall take care no bad con|&s;equence &s;hall attend his kindne&s;s. I knew Charles and he corre&s;ponded, but never thought of mentioning it to you.</P>
<P>As to what you advi&s;e about Mr. Skef|fington's going abroad, I am &s;en&s;ible it would be a great advantage to him; I know he wants it more than mo&s;t young men, becau&s;e he has pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with &s;uch unremitting application, that he really &s;ecluded him&s;elf from company and amu&s;ement a great deal more than was proper for his rank in life: but to you I will acknowlege, I cannot bring my&s;elf to think of it with any degree of fortitude; I cannot even reconcile my&s;elf to his go|ing to England, though I know he mu&s;t go in Spring; and if the idea of his being ab&s;ent two or three months is &s;o painful,
<PB N="87" REF="87">what would two or three yeas be? My imagination is &s;o fertile in creating trouble, that I &s;hould be mi&s;erable from the appre|hen&s;ion of dangers, which perhaps, he &s;hould never experience. I am really a|&s;hamed of my weakne&s;s, but cannot con|quer it; if we &s;hould be ever united, I would have no objection to going with him; for I do not fear dangers to my&s;elf half &s;o much as to tho&s;e I love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very happy to find Emily in Dublin when I return, which I hope will be &s;oon after Chri&s;tmas; for indeed the country is very dreary this time of year, and the air much too &s;harp for my mo|ther, who begins to complain of the rheu|mati&s;m, as well as for her daughter, who&s;e con&s;titution, you know, is but delicate.</P>
<P>I am glad Mr. O'Neil is to be in lodg|ings, that Emily may remain with you, which mu&s;t be more agreeable to her, though I have no doubt of her affection to her parents, yet one would not wi&s;h to be confined to their particularities, when it would oblige us to give up all the re&s;t of our friends.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="88">
<P>It would give me great plea&s;ure if your conjecture re&s;pecting cou&s;in James's at|tachment to her &s;hould prove true; they are worthy of each other; and I do not know where either of them could have a better pro&s;pect of happine&s;s. I &s;hall not hint it to Charles, though I am cer|tain he would not repeat it, if I de&s;ired him not, but I think there is a delicacy in the&s;e matters, where our female friends are concerned, that makes it improper to talk of them to men.</P>
<P>You deny that you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any degree of philo&s;ophy, and yet wi&s;h your|&s;elf to be rivalled; now, in my opinion, that is as great a &s;tretch of philo&s;ophy as DIOGENES him&s;elf could boa&s;t, though &s;o renowned for &s;elf-denial. But there is &s;omething in the affair between you and Mr. Maun&s;el, that has ever been a my&s;te|ry to me; yet as you always &s;eemed de|&s;irous to avoid the &s;ubject, I was unwil|ling to a&s;k any que&s;tions: that he loves you, cannot be doubted; indeed he does not endeavour to conceal it; and tho&s;e little attentions which you your&s;elf allow to be a proof, are very ob&s;ervable in him;
<PB N="89" REF="89">for I think the &s;malle&s;t minutiae that can be plea&s;ing to you, does not e&s;cape his notice. You cannot have had any quar|rel, becau&s;e the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between you; what then can pre|vent your union? I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s &s;ince there is no one to controul either of you.</P>
<P>Your wi&s;hing for a Rival, has drawn me in to a&s;k que&s;tions that are imperti|nent; however, I beg you will not think your&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer them; if it is in the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable to you, you have only to pa&s;s over this part of my letter in &s;ilence, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I will never mention it again.</P>
<P>If Charles and I &s;hould ever be mar|ried, (which probably a few days will determine) I flatter my&s;elf our affection will never be exhau&s;ted; though I am not romantic enough to expect it will continue ju&s;t what it is now, but I hope it will &s;ub&s;ide into a tender and la&s;ting friend|&s;hip, that will end only with our lives: and I think I have great rea&s;on to hope it will be &s;o, as neither of us have the &s;mall|e&s;t degree of ficklene&s;s in our di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="90" REF="90">el&s;e it mu&s;t have appeared by this time, which accounts too for our liking having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long; a circum&s;tance that &s;eems to &s;urpri&s;e you; but I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily account for our not looking on each other as brother and &s;i&s;ter, which might very well have happened from the manner we were brought up together; had that been the ca&s;e, it would have occa&s;ioned no &s;mall chagrin to our friends; and if I &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to break with him, I dread the effect it would have on my mother, who loves him as if he was her child, and has no joy equal to the pro&s;|pect of &s;eeing me his wife; for which rea&s;on, I have never given her a hint of what has pa&s;&s;ed in regard to Mr. Hamil|ton, till I &s;ee how it ends; I wi&s;h you were with me, for my &s;pirits begin to &s;ink at the apprehen&s;ion of what may happen when he comes, but I will call up all my re&s;olution, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to my peace to know for a certainty if Charles be likely to conquer his folly; for indeed I can give it no other name.</P>
<P>Let me hear from you very &s;oon: you &s;hall know how matters go on here, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 30. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I REJOICE to find my dear Eliza has cau&s;e to hope matters will turn out to her &s;atisfaction; and I am of opinion from what you tell me, that Charles is giving his rea&s;on fair play. What a deal of un|ea&s;ine&s;s he would have avoided, had he done &s;o before!</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very impatient to hear the event of Mr. Hamilton's vi&s;it; if he &s;hould come to the ca&s;tle, which I really wi&s;h he may; becau&s;e if there is the lea&s;t &s;park of jealou&s;y lurking in Charles's bo&s;om, he will not then be able to conceal it &s;o well, but the traces of di&s;content will be vi&s;ible on his countenance, and you will know to what it is to be attributed.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be well plea&s;ed to be with you for the time, as I &s;hould be more at lei&s;ure to make ob&s;ervations than you will be, and le&s;s partial; but I hope you will con&s;ider
<PB N="93" REF="93">your happine&s;s is at &s;take, and not be blind|ed by your tenderne&s;s; it will be a folly to conceal the truth from me, as you know. Harry will hear it, and then I &s;hall.</P>
<P>I have a high e&s;teem for Charles, but love you &s;till better, and cannot con&s;ent to your being his wife till we are quite &s;ure he has recovered his rationality.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry you are lo&s;ing the Boyle's; an agreeable neighbour in the country is a very material lo&s;s; but I hope it will de|termine your mother to come to town as &s;oon as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly can, now you have no companion. I always think of the good any evil may produce, which le&s;&s;ens the ill greatly, at lea&s;t makes it more &s;upporta|ble.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. O'Neil arrived la&s;t night, and have brought their little grand-daugh|ter: 'tis a beautiful infant, and as they tell me, the very temper of it's mother; &s;he had left it at home under the care of a re|lation that lives with her, a genteel, di&s;|creet woman; but Mr. O'Neil had it at his hou&s;e &s;ome part of every day, and when he was coming to town could not bear to be &s;o long without &s;eeing it; &s;o
<PB N="94" REF="94">brought the nur&s;e and little one off. Emi|ly, who did not expect it, was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed; for &s;he had often regretted leav|ing it, but &s;he meant to return &s;o &s;oon, and be&s;ides that, was afraid of offending her father, who adores it. We had it here to-day for a while, Emily had it on her knee when Mr. Fitzgerald came in; after paying his compliments, the child attracted his notice; the re&s;emblance is &s;o &s;triking, he knew it was Emily's, and took it in his arms to ki&s;s it, when the baby, who is but ju&s;t attempting to &s;peak, called him Papa; it &s;eems &s;he calls all men &s;o, but her mother's confu&s;ion is not to be de&s;cribed, and it was no way le&s;&s;ened by his &s;aying, he &s;hould be happy indeed, if he had a title to that appellation; at the &s;ame time giving Emily a look infinitely more expre&s;&s;ive than his words. She was &s;truck intirely dumb; Gertrude had a &s;mile full of meaning, and you cannot ima|gine any &s;cene more ridiculous than it was, till I, in compa&s;&s;ion, &s;et them all laugh|ing, by wi&s;hing the child was mine, that I might have &s;uch pretty things &s;aid to me; this &s;et us talking non&s;en&s;e, and gave her time to recover from the palpita|tion which his &s;peech had given her; but
<PB N="95" REF="95">I have a &s;trong notion this trifling circum|&s;tance has opened the way for a more &s;e|rious declaration from him, the fir&s;t con|venient opportunity: at pre&s;ent I am &s;ure &s;he will not accept him, for the rea&s;ons mentioned already, though I think he need not de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding in time; and indeed I join with you in opinion, that &s;he could not have a fairer pro&s;pect of happi|ne&s;s with any man I know.</P>
<P>Gertrude has a &s;mile in one eye, and a tear in the other; &s;he had a letter from her &s;wain this day, informing her, he had ju&s;t got his father's permi&s;&s;ion to take leave of him, and was in con&s;equence, &s;etting off for Paris, where his &s;tay would be ve|ry &s;hort, as they were in daily expectati|on of embarking, but &s;ays, he will cer|tainly inform his father of the true &s;tate of his heart, before he leaves home, and will let her know the re&s;ult. This is the mo&s;t material part of his letter; the re&s;t contains only love-like expre&s;&s;ions of fear for what may happen during his ab&s;ence, and &s;oldier-like hopes of a &s;peedy return, crowned with laurels.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="96">
<P>You may gue&s;s, the account of his fa|ther &s;ending for him, is very plea&s;ing to her, but the thoughts of his going to America ca&s;ts a damp on her &s;pirits: &s;he is the picture of an April day, alternate clouds and &s;un-&s;hine, as each reflection happens to predominate. She begged I would tell you the news, as you were &s;o kind to expre&s;s a de&s;ire to be informed of any circum&s;tance that occured.</P>
<P>I have not forgot your que&s;tion about Harry Maun&s;ell, nor do I intend to pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence; though I confe&s;s, it is a jubject I have hitherto avoided: but I hope my dear Eliza does not look on my re&s;erve in that particular, as any breach of the perfect confidence that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between us; for it's the only occurrence of my life in which I have not been quite open, and you mu&s;t con&s;ider, the mo&s;t material cir|cum&s;tance relating to it, pa&s;&s;ed while you were too young to be my confidant; and &s;ince that, I thought the le&s;s was &s;aid of it the better; for it has the appearance of vanity to talk of having refu&s;ed a man; and looks too, as if one wi&s;hed to prevent his marrying another; for cer|tainly, it could not recommend him much to any lady he might addre&s;s, to know
<PB N="97" REF="97">he would not think of her, if he could have had me; and till very lately, I had no notion he would be &s;o fooli&s;hly roman|tic, as to determine on living &s;ingle, be|cau&s;e I cannot marry him. But you mu&s;t know, in that letter, which I believe I had from his &s;i&s;ter, before &s;he knew he was coming to town, &s;he mentioned, &s;he had great rea&s;on to think her &s;i&s;ter-in|law, Mi&s;s Herbert, liked Harry; and &s;he had &s;ome hopes that &s;he was plea&s;ing to him, as he paid more attention to her, than ever &s;he had &s;een him pay to any woman, except one; and &s;ince his pa&s;&s;ion for that one was hopele&s;s, nothing would be more agreeable to her than a union be|tween him and Mi&s;s Herbert, who was both as to per&s;on and fortune, a de&s;irable match for him,</P>
<P>I had another letter from Mrs. Her|bert, by Harry, reque&s;ting I would en|deavour to di&s;cover his real &s;entiments for her &s;i&s;ter, as a circum&s;tance had happened &s;ince her la&s;t, that made her fear he thought not of her in that way &s;he had hoped, and at the &s;ame time left no doubt of her attachment to him; which was &s;o very vi&s;ible, &s;he was &s;ure he mu&s;t have
<PB N="98" REF="98">perceived it, though he would not &s;eem to do &s;o; which looked as if he did not mean to make any advantage of it. However, &s;he begged I would u&s;e my influence, which, &s;he &s;ays, is all-powerful, to pre|vail on him to think &s;eriou&s;ly of it: and even de&s;ired me to inform him of the la|dy's partiality towards him, which &s;he thought might induce him to make her a return: at all events &s;he &s;aid, I mu&s;t in|&s;i&s;t on his being quite explicit; for if he will not comply with our wi&s;hes, it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to inform Mi&s;s Herbert of the &s;tate of Harry's heart, that &s;he may recall her own, before it is too late.</P>
<P>I executed my commi&s;&s;ion with very bad &s;ucce&s;s; for my influence joined to every argument I could employ were in|&s;ufficient to per&s;uade him to return the lady's pa&s;&s;ion, (which he &s;aid he had with concern di&s;covered, ju&s;t before he left home) and only drew from him a decla|ration, that as there was an in&s;uperable bar between him and I, he was determin|ed never to marry. I endeavoured to &s;hew him the folly of &s;uch a re&s;olution, but to no purpo&s;e; and when I &s;ound
<PB N="99" REF="99">him &s;o determined, I told him he &s;hould then be cautious how he gave any girl room to think &s;he was agreeable to him; and he a&s;&s;ured me, it was Mi&s;s Herbert's re&s;emblance to me, both in per&s;on and manner, that attracted his notice; but he hoped I would acquit him of any de&s;ign to gain her affections, when he knew he could make her no return; he &s;hould abhor him&s;elf if he could be guilty of &s;uch a di&s;honourable action; indeed I do not &s;u&s;pect him for it; vanity is not among&s;t his faults. I wi&s;h, for his own &s;ake, he had le&s;s con&s;tancy; for I think an old bat|chelor the mo&s;t forlorn being in the Uni|ver&s;e, though an old maid may be quite the rever&s;e; the dome&s;tic life being natu|ral to women, they can manage their hou&s;e and &s;ee company as well without a hu&s;band as with one, if not better; and if they di&s;like living alone, they cannot fail of a &s;emale companion, unle&s;s their temper is very bad; and in that ca&s;e they could not be happy in marriage.</P>
<P>But all this while you will &s;ay, you are not a bit the wi&s;er re&s;pecting this &s;ame &s;aid my&s;tery between Harry and me: true,
<PB N="100" REF="100">my dear, nor are you likely, till next po&s;t, for I am called down to company, and can only add, that I am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 1&s;t. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS I imagine my dear Eliza's curio&s;ity is on full &s;tretch for the delightful hi&s;tory of Henry and Loui&s;a, I take the fir&s;t lei&s;ure hour to give it you, for I &s;up|po&s;e I &s;hould be quite out of favour if I pa&s;&s;ed one po&s;t, and perhaps&punc; I might not have time to-morrow.</P>
<P>I believe you may remember that in old Mr. Maun&s;ell's time the family &s;pent every winter in Dublin, and as they were our next door neighbours, there was a great in|timacy between him and my father; their example was followed by their children, and Patty Maun&s;ell and I (who were much of an age) were &s;carce ever a&s;under. Harry was but a year older than his &s;i&s;ter; and as we were all children when our fir&s;t ac|quaintance commenced, he was u&s;ually with us till he was &s;ent to a public &s;chool, and I recollect when he came to take leave of our family, he could not be forced from
<PB N="102" REF="102">me without the greate&s;t difficulty; as for me, after &s;hedding a few tears I was con|&s;oled for his lo&s;s; &s;ince Patty was &s;till with me, I did not &s;ee him for three years after our fir&s;t &s;eparation, as the ill health of his mother and mine took both the families to Spa, where, and in France we remained about two years and a half when we return|ed, and had the misfortune to lo&s;e two of the be&s;t women in the world in a few months after. My mother died fir&s;t, and I received all the comfort and attention from poor Mrs. Maun&s;ell, that was in her power to give; for tho' &s;he was declining fa&s;t her&s;elf, &s;he let Patty &s;tay entirely with me, till the fir&s;t &s;hock was over, and I be|gan to be reconciled to my lo&s;s; &s;he did not long &s;urvive, and when &s;he found &s;he could not live many days, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee her &s;on, who was accordingly &s;ent for; when he arrived I was returning the me|lancholy compliment to Patty, a&s;&s;i&s;ting in her attendance on her mother, and endea|vouring to comfort her for the lo&s;s &s;he was going to &s;u&s;tain: my father being out of town on bu&s;ine&s;s, I could dedicate all my time to this friendly office; and indeed I never left her for a day, till his return, which was not for a month after Mrs. Maun&s;ell's death. During that time, the
<PB N="103" REF="103">childi&s;h affection which Harry expre&s;&s;ed for me, before he went to &s;chool, &s;eemed to be ripened into a more &s;erious attachment: he did not in plain terms tell me &s;o, but &s;ome body has &s;aid actions have a language, and his were &s;o eloquent as not to be mi&s;|taken; I did not however &s;eem to perceive it, tho' I acknowledge I was far from being indifferent about him: you who know him will not be &s;u&s;pri&s;ed at that, e&s;pecially when I tell you, that joined to a mind as faultle&s;s as human nature could ad|mit, he then, notwith&s;tanding his youth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e manly graces of per|&s;on for which you have &s;o often ad|mired him; add to that, we had parted children, and now met, when both our per&s;ons and manners were &s;trikingly im|proved, and we at an age when the heart is but too open to &s;oft impre&s;&s;ions; and being in the &s;ame hou&s;e for a month we made a greater progre&s;s in each other's e&s;|teem, than if we had met on temporary vi&s;its for a twelve-month.</P>
<P>Soon after I went home Harry entered the college, and while he was in it, his at|tendance on his duties, (in which he was very a&s;&s;iduous) kept the family longer
<PB N="104" REF="104">in town every &s;ummer than was u&s;ual, by which means he had &s;uch con&s;tant oppor|tunities of &s;eeing me, that his pa&s;&s;ion never had time to cool, which probably it would have done, had we been &s;eparated ju&s;t when it was beginning; unfortunately for him, that did not happen till he was going to travel in three years after, and by that time his love was proof again&s;t ab&s;ence; yet he had &s;o much prudence as never to make any declaration, or attempt to draw me into any engagement that might have in|volved us in difficulties; but before he &s;et out, Patty took an opportunity of lament|ing to me, that her brother was never likely to be &s;ettled to his mind during their father's life; for tho' the allowance he gave him, was ample for a &s;ingle man, it would not &s;upport a wife, as the woman he would wi&s;h to marry ought to be &s;upported, not could he think of offering him&s;elf to any one, while he was unable to make &s;uch a &s;ettlement as &s;he had a right to expect; and his father had given him to under&s;tand he had done all he could afford to do, with|out &s;tinting him&s;elf, which he would not do, nor would Harry permit him if he was inclined; for you know, Loui&s;a, continued &s;he, my father was always u&s;ed to profu&s;ion, and is not at a time of life to be debarred
<PB N="105" REF="105">of what he has been accu&s;tomed to; it is much fitter Harry &s;hould &s;uffer for a time, tho' I am &s;ure it is no &s;mall mortification to him.</P>
<P>I was very &s;en&s;ible this di&s;cour&s;e was in|tended as an apology to me for his &s;ilence on a &s;ubject, which his behaviour gave me all the rea&s;on in the world to expect he would come to an explanation about, before he went abroad. I took no other notice of it however, than to join in opinion with her, that their father ought not to be put to any inconvenience; tho' I dare &s;ay my looks betrayed a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inten|tion of her &s;peech, or at lea&s;t, my not a&s;king who the lady was, might convince her I gue&s;&s;ed her meaning, and did not chu&s;e to have it farther explained, which was the real truth.</P>
<P>Harry left us &s;oon after, and as we were always on the mo&s;t friendly footing, I did not he&s;itate to expre&s;s a moderate concern at lo&s;ing him for &s;o long a time; he endea|voured in vain to re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion with|in the bounds he had hitherto pre&s;cribed to it; the idea of parting was too &s;trong for his prudence, and he took &s;uch a tender farewel as convinced me of the &s;entiments
<PB N="106" REF="106">he entertained for me, more than a thou|&s;and vows and prote&s;tations would have done.</P>
<P>He wrote regularly to his &s;i&s;ter, who al|ways &s;hewed me his letters while &s;he was in town, and when &s;he left it u&s;ed to &s;end them to me, by his de&s;ire, no doubt, as he knew I would be entertained with his account of of the countries thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed; and be&s;ide that, I was always mentioned in a manner that would have been plea&s;ing, even tho' my heart was quite unconcerned.</P>
<P>He had been about a year away, when I made a con&s;iderable conque&s;t one even|ing at a drum; a gentleman, that &s;hall be namele&s;s; (becau&s;e I don't think it genteel to &s;peak of tho&s;e we have refu&s;ed) &s;tood at the back of my chair while I lo&s;t two or three rubbers, and perceiving it did not ruffle my temper, wi&s;ely concluded I would make a mo&s;t de&s;irable wife, and paid a vi&s;it to my father with whom he had a &s;light acquaintance, and without farther doubting my acceptance of an offer &s;o ad|vantageous, added to the powerful induce|ment of a title, and a very ancient family,
<PB N="107" REF="107">(the latter joined to &s;ettlements that were far above my expectations) had great wright with my father, who being de&s;cend|ded from the olde&s;t families in England, hold a long pedigree in great veneration; but tho' I too have all due re&s;pect for tho&s;e things, I thought &s;omething more was needful, and could not marry any man for the merit of his ance&s;tors; and I could &s;ee no one agreeable quality in him&s;elf: be&s;ide that from what I had heard of his di&s;po&s;ition, I though it probable he might put his wife's temper to trials more &s;evere than that of lo&s;ing at cards, and tho' my patience held out again&s;t bad fortune, I could not an&s;wer for its being &s;o com|plai&s;ant to a bad hu&s;band; then his apply|ing to my father, without fir&s;t endeavour|ing to gain my approbation, di&s;gu&s;ted me exceedingly, as it &s;hewed he mu&s;t either think my good opinion of very little con&s;e|quence, or el&s;e he mu&s;t have a large &s;hare of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, that made him take it for granted I could not refu&s;e him: take it any way, there was &s;o little delicacy in it, and &s;o much the appearance of thinking he conferred a favour, that it was a plea&s;ure to me to mortify his pride by rejecting him, which I did when he came in full confidence of being joyfully accepted, as I
<PB N="108" REF="108">could &s;ee from the a&s;toni&s;hment vi&s;ible in his countenance, and which indeed was &s;o great that he had not power to &s;peak; &s;o when I fini&s;hed my &s;peech, which was very laconic, I made my curt&s;y and with|drew, leaving my father to reconcile him to his di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed between them after I was gone I cannot &s;ay, but my father informed me that evening, his lord&s;hip had begged his permi&s;&s;ion to continue his vi&s;its, in hopes a little attention on his &s;ide might re|move my objections, as he feared he had been too ha&s;ty, for it was u&s;ual for young ladies to expect to be &s;olicited &s;ome time before they were required to give an an|&s;wer. And I hope, &s;ir, &s;aid I (with quick|ne&s;s) you did not encourage him: and why not child was his an&s;wer; &s;uch offers are not to be met with every day, and de|&s;erve at lea&s;t to be con&s;idered before they are refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>If that be all, &s;ir, &s;aid I, he has nothing to hope from giving me time to con&s;ider, for I di&s;like the man, and never can bring my&s;elf to marry him: rather &s;ay, Loui&s;a, &s;aid my father, you like another man, and are meanly waiting till he thinks proper to
<PB N="109" REF="109">a&s;k you. This unexpected attack con|founded me a good deal, but as it really was not the cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent refu&s;al, I &s;oon recovered my&s;elf, and a&s;ked him who he &s;u&s;pected of having &s;uch influence over me.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly replied, I believe your own heart will tell you, it is Harry Maun&s;ell I mean; he is a young man I have a high e&s;teem for, and if he has any thoughts of you, and had made a proper declaration of it before he went abroad, I &s;hould have no objection; but as it is, if he was a prince, and you can be &s;o abject as to wait his plea&s;ure&mdash;you are no daughter of mine.</P>
<P>This unu&s;ual &s;everity of &s;peech from a father who had been always &s;o indulgent, threw me into tears, which in&s;tantly &s;oft|ened him, and taking my hand, my dear; &s;aid he, I did not mean to di&s;tre&s;s you, but I cannot bear with patience that any man &s;hould think he may have you, at any time he finds him&s;elf at lei&s;ure to a&s;k.</P>
<P>Convince me Harry is not the cau&s;e of your refu&s;ing his lord&s;hip's offer, and tho I greatly approve it, I will immediately free you from his addre&s;&s;es: I a&s;&s;ured him I could
<PB N="110" REF="110">with great truth aver, he was not the cau&s;e, for my di&s;like proceeded from circum|&s;tances I had heard, and ob&s;ervations I had made of his lord&s;hip's di&s;po&s;ition, which was really true, as I had often met him at the &s;ame hou&s;e before that unlucky night when he took a fancy to me, but to put the matter out of all doubt, I gave a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to marry Harrry Maun&s;ell.</P>
<P>My father &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with me, re&s;umed his wonted good humour, and I heard no more of my noble admirer, except that the lady of the hou&s;e where I &s;aw him, told me, it was with great dif|ficulty he could be per&s;uaded to re&s;ign his hopes of gaining me.</P>
<P>What a long winded tale is here!&mdash;I am &s;o tired of it that I mu&s;t defer the remainder to another opportunity.

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 2.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I GREATLY long to hear from my dear Eliza, as I expect your next will contain a full and true account of the effect Mr. Hamilton's vi&s;it, (that is &s;uppo&s;ing he came to the ca&s;tle) had on Charles; and I dare &s;ay, before this reaches you, you will be quite as impatient for the continuation of my romance. I cannot deny but I felt &s;ome regret, when fir&s;t I reflected on the re&s;trictions I had laid my&s;elf under, but it proceeded chiefly from the pain I thought it would give Harry, when he &s;hould be informed of it; however, the plea&s;ure I enjoyed in being freed from the &s;olicitations of a man I di&s;liked, &s;oon reconciled me to it, but I wi&s;hed much for an opportunity of telling Patty what had happened, that &s;he might hint it to her brother, yet I could not think of writing it to her, as &s;he had never &s;poke to me in plain terms on the &s;ubject, &s;o I determined to let it lye till
<PB N="113" REF="113">&s;he came to town, when I thought it likely I might find means of introducing it; but in that I was di&s;appointed; for before their u&s;ual time of leaving the country &s;he was married to Mr. Herbert, which detained them &s;ome time, and ju&s;t when they intended coming up, her father was &s;eized with that illne&s;s which occa&s;ioned his death, after confining him to his room the whole winter, during which time Patty never quitted his Hou&s;e; and when he was gone her hu&s;band took her home, the &s;ea&s;on being then &s;o far ad|vanced, it was not worth the trouble of coming to town, for the &s;hort time they could have &s;taid.</P>
<P>Mr. Maun&s;ell's death ha&s;tened Harry's return, who arrived at Cork in May, which was about three months after, but his father having left his affairs in rather an un&s;ettled &s;tate, owing to indolence in attending to his agents accounts, that bu|&s;ine&s;s detained him in the country till win|ter; by which means I had time enough to be prepared for an interview, which I believe would have affected me a good deal had it happened a few months &s;ooner, but by this time I was perfectly &s;atis|fied
<PB N="114" REF="114">with what I had done. I was how|ever a little fluttered when I &s;aw his carri|age &s;top at his own hou&s;e, where he did not remain ten minutes before he paid me a vi&s;it, and though my father's pre&s;ence a little re&s;trained his tongue, his eyes plain|ly told me what he wi&s;hed to &s;ay; com|pany coming in he &s;taid only till tea was over, as he &s;aw it would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak to me that evening, but next morn|ing he came in, at an hour he knew my father would be out, and after many tender profe&s;&s;ions of joy at &s;eeing me, offered him|&s;elf and fortune to my acceptance, and begged my permi&s;&s;ion to make &s;uch pro|po&s;als to my father, as he hoped would meet his approbation.</P>
<P>I hardly knew how to go about telling him a circum&s;tance, that would at once da&s;h all the hopes of happine&s;s with which he had been &s;o long flattering him&s;elf; but it mu&s;t be done, and I accompli&s;hed it in the be&s;t manner I was able: it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to give you an indea of the agitation that appeared in his counte|nance while I &s;poke; I felt for his di&s;ap|pointment, and u&s;ed every argument in my power to &s;often the &s;everity of it; but he
<PB N="115" REF="115">was for a time ab&s;olutely incapable of li&s;|tening to rea&s;on. He execrated the man who&s;e offers had been the occa&s;ion of my making &s;uch a promi&s;e, and cur&s;ed the family pride that had in&s;tigated my father to require it; in &s;hort, he &s;aid a thou&s;and extravagant things, and railed him&s;elf out of breath before I could bring him to any degree of compo&s;ure; at la&s;t I convinced him that as his behaviour to me had been always &s;o particular that every one ob&s;erved it, my father had great rea&s;on to think I I was ill treated when he went abroad with|out explaining his &s;entiments, and of cour&s;e it was natural for him to re&s;ent it, as it mu&s;t hurt him much to have it &s;uppo&s;ed I was waiting any man's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>All his anger was then turned on him&s;elf, for not declaring both his pa&s;&s;ion and his &s;ituation in pecuniary matters, before he left Ireland; but he determined to clear it up to my father that he might be rein&s;tated in his good opinion, though it could an|&s;wer no other purpo&s;e, as the promi&s;e I made was &s;olemn and unconditional, there|fore could not be revoked.</P>
<P>I &s;aid all I could to per&s;uade him to look out for &s;ome other woman, capable of
<PB N="116" REF="116">making him happy, which would be the be&s;t method of blotting me from his mind, except as a friend, in which light I &s;hould ever e&s;teem him; but my arguments had no effect, and though I thought a lit|tle time would change his romantic noti|ons, I find he is now as determined as ever. When my father was acquainted with the nature of his &s;ilence, he expre&s;|&s;ed much concern at the ob&s;tacle that was between us, and &s;aid, if it would &s;atisfy my &s;cruples, he would willingly free me, as far as in him lay, but as I had &s;hewed no reluctance in making the promi&s;e, he believed I could not ea&s;ily be brought to think he could relea&s;e me from it; but that Harry did not tell me, till I had giv|en a final an&s;wer; which was, I did not think any power on earth could di&s;pen&s;e with a &s;olemn vow, unle&s;s it was taken by compul&s;ion, and that was not the ca&s;e with me. I therefore intreated Harry never to mention the affair again, and by that means he might bring him&s;elf to forget it. As to the fir&s;t part, he &s;aid he &s;hould certainly obey me, but the latter he knew was impo&s;&s;ible; it was too deeply engra|ven on his heart. I have often &s;ince, at his &s;i&s;ter's reque&s;t, pre&s;&s;ed him to think of
<PB N="117" REF="117">marrying, but though deprived of all glimmering of hope, his attachment &s;eems &s;tronger every time we meet; and you know we are very much a&s;under: but he really may &s;ing, "His pa&s;&s;ion's con&s;tant as the &s;un."&mdash;For me, I acknowlege, I have the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip for him; and find it very flattering to be the &s;ole object of attention, to a mo&s;t amiable young man, who&s;e love, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t be of the pure&s;t kind, &s;ince he can have no intere&s;t to gratify, nor the lea&s;t expec|tation of gratifying his pa&s;&s;ion. I do not, however, at all, regret being debarred from marrying him; had I thought it a &s;tate capable of making me happier than I am, I &s;hould not have carried the Ro|mance &s;o far as to refu&s;e &s;ome other young men, that you know addre&s;&s;ed me, and who certainly had merit &s;ufficient both to gain my heart, and keep it; I never had a high idea of matrimonial felicity: and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, the ob&s;ervations I have made among&s;t my married acquaintance has not altered my opinion. My notions of happine&s;s, may, perhaps, be &s;ingular, and I do not wi&s;h to make converts to it; if many thought as I do, it would be of the wor&s;t con&s;equence; there would be an
<PB N="118" REF="118">end of all the tender relation&s;hips that bind mankind to each other, and the world would be one continued &s;cene of di&s;cord and confu&s;ion: the in&s;tituion is certainly good and capable of making us happy; but human nature is &s;o perver&s;e that we have ingeniou&s;ly contrived to fru&s;trate the beneficent intentions of heaven in that, as well as other things, and turned to our mi&s;ery what was meant to promote our happine&s;s, it is not however nece&s;&s;ary that every one &s;hould marry, and I really be|lieve Providence de&s;igned me for a &s;ingle life, as it always appeared to me the mo&s;t elegible, and, I am convinced, is mo&s;t &s;uited to my di&s;po&s;ition; if every one con|&s;idered their own temper, there would probably be fewer unhappy matches than we now &s;ee, but that is what we &s;hall never per&s;uade the generality of people to think nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o we mu&s;t even let them go on, ki&s;&s;ing one moment, and quarrelling the next, to the end of the chapter; and I have &s;een violent advocates for wedlock pa&s;s their whole life that way; but I &s;uppo&s;e they thought it happine&s;s, or they would not have &s;o &s;trongly recommended the &s;tate to others.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Mi&s;s FITZGERALD, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 5. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DELAYED writing to my Loui&s;a the&s;e many days, for two rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, till I had the whole of your intere&s;ting na|rative: &s;econd, till Mr. Hamilton was gone, and I &s;hould be able to tell you, how we went on here.</P>
<P>Charles met him at the place appointed, and ea&s;ily prevailed on him to pa&s;s a &s;ew days here, before he &s;et out for home; he did not leave us till this morning, when Charles accompanied him according to promi&s;e, and is not to return this fort|night. You cannot imagine how &s;olitary I &s;eem without him: but to the material point, which I am &s;ure will give you great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He never &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;ympton of jealou&s;y or unea&s;ine&s;s, the whole time Mr. Hamilton was here, though I could per|ceive, he &s;crutinou&s;ly ob&s;erved every look
<PB N="121" REF="121">and word that pa&s;&s;ed between him and me, and I was well plea&s;ed he did, as it mu&s;t tend to cure him of his &s;u&s;picions, as far as they related to me; and Mr. Hamilton, I &s;aw, avoided addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf &s;o par|ticularly to me, when Charles was pre&s;ent, as he would do at other times; no doubt, for fear of giving him pain; for he had heard, &s;ince fir&s;t we met, how matters were circum&s;tanced between us, and I dare &s;ay, gue&s;&s;ed at Charles's foible from his beha|viour at the Inn; el&s;e why that caution? for his addre&s;s to me at all times, was on|ly what might be expected from a man of politene&s;s; though he had told me, he had heard of the intention of our family, with regard to Mr. Skeffington and me, ju&s;t in time to recall his heart: I believe I looked rather &s;imple; but I cho&s;e to take that opportunity of acknowleging my at|tachment, and an&s;wered, it was true, our parents had always intended us for each other, and happily for me, Mr Skeffing|ton's amiable qualities, made my duty and inclination go hand in hand. He paid me &s;ome genteel compliments on what he called my ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;aid, Mr. Skeffington was, indeed, a happy man in meeting with a lady &s;o far above the little
<PB N="122" REF="122">punctilios of the Sex, as not to be a&s;ham|ed to acknowlege the impre&s;&s;ion his merit had made on her heart. It was a compli|ment, however, that I did not de&s;erve, for I felt very much a&s;hamed at making the acknowledgment, and certainly would not have done it, but that I had rea&s;on to think he had &s;ome little liking for me; and if I was &s;ilent he might take it for en|couragement; for though I never &s;aw any thing like vanity in him; and there is few men ignorant of their own perfecti|ons, and I dare &s;ay, he is &s;en&s;ible that both as to per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, he is &s;uch as might gain any woman's favour, who had no pre-engagement.</P>
<P>I told you I dreaded his coming here, though I wi&s;hed it; but I had a thou&s;and fears, le&s;t Charles &s;hould be unable to command his temper, and therefore ex|po&s;e him&s;elf, and throw me into a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation; but as it happened, my fears were needle&s;s; he behaved very well, and we were all ea&s;y and chearful. Part of the time we had &s;ome other com|pany, yet I wanted the Boyle's very much; they went to Belfa&s;t a day or two before I wrote la&s;t, and I cannot repair my lo&s;s while I am here; but my mother will go
<PB N="123" REF="123">to town as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after Chri&s;t|mas.</P>
<P>I am now to thank you for giving up &s;o much of your time to my amu&s;ement; and indeed your little Story affords both entertainment and in&s;truction, in the man|ner you tell it; but how few could follow your example! in &s;o intirely &s;ubjecting their pa&s;&s;ion to their rea&s;on, as not even to repine at obeying your father, though we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s it mu&s;t have affected you much at the time: your good &s;en&s;e enabled you to bear a di&s;appointment that mo&s;t girls, at the age you then were, would have thought in&s;upportable, the object con&s;ider|ed: for certainly, Harry Maun&s;ell's me|rit would be a powerful excu&s;e for refu&s;ing to abjure all hopes of being united to him, when one knew it was a generous motive prevented him from explaining his &s;entiments. I cannot help thinking you have an uncommon &s;hare of Philo&s;ophy, though you will not allow me to &s;ay &s;o; but as it is po&s;&s;ible Harry has not &s;o much, I pity him exceedingly: his re&s;olution to remain &s;ingle, is a convincing proof of the &s;trength of his affection. I mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, acknowlege, it &s;avours more
<PB N="124" REF="124">of the Romantic than I &s;hould have &s;u&s;|pected him, or any other young man of this age for.</P>
<P>Whenever I hear the Platonic &s;y&s;tem di&s;puted, I hope you will give me leave to produce you and your Swain, as a proof in favour of the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Your opinion has &s;uch weight with me, that I am heartily &s;orry it is &s;o unfavour|able to matrimony; for I know you con|&s;ider a &s;ubject mo&s;t deliberately before you form a judgment: and I am &s;atisfied you would not determine again&s;t the &s;tate, if you did not think there was a &s;mall chance of happine&s;s in it. I never could form the lea&s;t idea how Mr. Maun&s;ell and you were circum&s;tanced, nor could I gue&s;s why you did not marry him: I plainly &s;aw he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of you; and to tell truth, I thought you had no di&s;like to him; therefore, could by no means gue&s;s at the cau&s;e of delay, when you had both been &s;o long at your own di&s;po&s;al. Will you give me leave to blame your father? however indulgent in other re&s;pects, he was, &s;urely, too &s;evere in exacting &s;uch a promi&s;e from you, as the only terms on
<PB N="125" REF="125">which he would free you from the ad|dre&s;&s;es of a man you a&s;&s;ured him you could not like, if you had never &s;een Harry. I think he might have depended on you for not doing any thing beneath the family you &s;prung from; for though you are not haughty, you have that proper degree of pride, which would prevent your bearing an indignity; therefore, he might be &s;ure you would not accept of Harry or any other man, who&s;e behaviour, when ex|plained, would not meet the approbation of your friends.</P>
<P>Do not you think Patty was too clo&s;e, when &s;he told you, her brother could not marry while his father lived? and the rea&s;on of it, had &s;he &s;aid plainly, you were the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his heart; it would have prevented the di&s;agreeable con|&s;equence that en&s;ued, becau&s;e you could then have told your father, but in the manner &s;he &s;poke, it would really have looked very vain to take it to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am &s;o &s;orry for Mr. Maun&s;ell, that I am di&s;po&s;ed to find fault with every one who was any way the cau&s;e of his di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<PB N="126" REF="126">
<P>I made a thou&s;and reflections as I read, but will not, at pre&s;ent, trouble you with any more of them, except, that I cannot imagine how you kept it &s;uch a &s;ecret; for though I have heard many expre&s;s their &s;urpri&s;e that you did not marry him, I never yet heard a rea&s;on why you did not; and in general, tho&s;e &s;ort of affairs are very &s;oon whi&s;pered about.</P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed with what you men|tion of cou&s;in James and Emily; he could not bring any one into the family that would be more agreeable to all his relati|ons; I an&s;wer for them all, becau&s;e I have heard it wi&s;hed for among&s;t the old folks who knew her.</P>
<P>I &s;ympathi&s;e with Gertrude, both in her joy and &s;orrow; I judge what &s;he mu&s;t fed at the idea of the Count going abroad, from what I &s;hould feel my&s;elf; but I hope &s;he has more fortitude than I &s;hould have on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, el&s;e &s;he mu&s;t be very unhappy.</P>
<P>I am quite obliged to her for de&s;iring you to tell me what occurred, and beg you will never forget to inform me when &s;he
<PB N="127" REF="127">hears from him, as I am really intere&s;ted in the event on her account; &s;ure his fa|ther cannot have any objection to the choice he has made.</P>
<P>If Charles &s;hould write to Mr. Maun&s;ell, no doubt you will &s;ee the letter, and I believe I need not reque&s;t you will let me know the contents, or procure me a &s;ight of it, for I dare &s;ay, you would not wi&s;h to conceal any thing that is material to know.</P>

<P>A CONTINUAL round of company at home, and vi&s;iting abroad, this week pa&s;t, prevented me from acknow|ledging my dear Eliza's la&s;t favour, which I was &s;orry for, as I &s;uppo&s;e you are rather in the di&s;mals on account of Charles being away; but I hope you have too much &s;en&s;e to let &s;uch a trifle depre&s;s your &s;pirits very much.</P>
<P>I am heartily glad Mr. Hamilton's vi&s;it pa&s;&s;ed off &s;o well, e&s;pecially as he really does admire you: you &s;ee how quick|&s;ighted jealou&s;y is, for Charles perceived the impre&s;&s;ion you had made on him im|mediately, as he mentions, in his letter to Harry; if he writes on this occa&s;ion, I &s;hall certainly inform you; but by what you &s;ay of his behaviour, I have great hopes he has recovered his rea&s;on; for I think he could hardly have di&s;&s;embled his unea&s;ine&s;s during &s;o many days.</P>
<PB N="129" REF="129">
<P>I am happy in having amu&s;ed you with my little &s;tory; as to the in&s;truction I can|not &s;ay much about it; for was it public, probably more would condemn than ap|prove my conduct: at lea&s;t I am &s;ure I &s;hould be held in abhorrence by all tho&s;e who think LOVE an excu&s;e for every act of imprudence or di&s;obedience, they can be guilty of: but I do not take &s;uch merit to my&s;elf as you are willing to allow me, for not repining at what is pa&s;t; I have no claim to your prai&s;es on that head, becau&s;e the &s;ingle &s;tate is really mo&s;t &s;uitable to my inclinations, yet notwith&s;tanding it is more than probable if I had not made that pro|mi&s;e, Mr. Maun&s;ell might have prevailed on me to marry, again&s;t the conviction of my rea&s;on; but as that is now impo&s;&s;ible, no other man is likely to have &s;ufficient in|fluence over my heart, to make me do any thing contrary to my judgment; &s;o that in&s;tead of repining, I rather think I have cau&s;e to rejoice, that I have a certainty of pa&s;&s;ing my life in the &s;tate mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me. But you may, perhaps, think, it requires all the philo&s;ophy you talk of, to enable me to &s;upport the re|proachful appellation of an Old Maid; it might be &s;o formerly, but do not you re|member,
<PB N="130" REF="130">my dear, that Mr. Twi&s;s has kindly re&s;cued us in this kingdom from unde&s;erved contempt, by allowing the old maids of Ireland to be perfectly plea&s;ing and agreeable; and &s;ince he acknowledges it, I think I have nothing to dread; for you know he allowed no perfection either in the country or the people, that he could po&s;&s;ibly detract from. I doubt the Plato|nic &s;y&s;tem would not gain much by pro|ducing Harry as proof of it's exi&s;tence; for I fear his pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o perfectly re|fined as that requires, though I grant you it is more romantic than what we u&s;ually meet with, indeed more &s;o than is for his peace, becau&s;e he certainly did not wi&s;h to live &s;ingle, and has determined to do &s;o, merely in con&s;equence of his di&s;appoint|ment; it is a re&s;olation I by no means ap|prove, as I think he will be apt to repent it, or at lea&s;t have cau&s;e to do &s;o, when youthful pa&s;&s;ion has &s;ub&s;ided, and he finds him&s;elf a &s;olitary being in his own hou&s;e, without any companion, and depending on the care of &s;ervants: if ill health &s;hould be the attendant on old age, as u&s;ually is, my arguments will then have all their weight in his mind, and he will be &s;orry he would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be con|vinced by them before it was too late.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="131">
<P>You are &s;o ab&s;orbed in compa&s;&s;ion for him, that you do not take the lea&s;t notice of poor Mi&s;s Herbert, who&s;e haple&s;s love I expected would have a large &s;hare of your pity.</P>
<P>I wrote Patty an account of my un&s;uc|ce&s;sful pleading in behalf of her &s;i&s;ter-in|law; and as I was convinced it would be in vain to hope for any alteration in Harry's &s;entiments, I advi&s;ed her to take the fir&s;t opportunity of letting the lady know the whole of the affair between him and me, and his determination to remain unmarried, that &s;he may withdraw her affections be|fore they are &s;o &s;trongly fixed as to make the effort painful.</P>
<P>I have had an an&s;wer, wherein &s;he tells me, &s;he bad let Mi&s;s Herbert into the &s;e|cret of Harry's attachment to me, the day after &s;he received my letter, &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e happening between them which introduced it very a-pro-pos; &s;he &s;ays, &s;he li&s;tened very attentively while &s;he &s;poke; her colour frequently changing, and now and then interrupted her with tender ex|pre&s;&s;ions of pity for his di&s;appointment;
<PB N="132" REF="132">at the conclu&s;ion &s;he &s;ighed heavily, and &s;aid, &s;he wondered how any woman could di&s;like Mr. Maun&s;ell, to whom he endea|voured to render him&s;elf agreeable; but when &s;he heard it was quite otherwi&s;e, Patty &s;ays, her a&s;toni&s;hment is not to be de&s;cribed: &s;he could not conceive it po&s;|&s;ible, that any con&s;ideration even of duty, &s;hould have force to prevail on a woman that loved Mr. Maun&s;ell, to give him up for ever.</P>
<P>Oh! madam, &s;aid &s;he, had Mi&s;s Mor|timer qualified the promi&s;e &s;o as to leave it in her father's power to relea&s;e her, they might have been happy; but now they mu&s;t &s;urely be wretched. Patty &s;aid, in|deed, &s;he knew no body happier; for my pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o intirely under the go|vernment of rea&s;on, that I never &s;uffered them to interrupt my peace. The tears &s;tood in the poor girl's eyes, and &s;he only &s;aid, &s;uch fortitude &s;eldom fell to the &s;hare of our &s;ex.</P>
<P>She was very ill the remainder of that day and the next, but when Patty wrote, was much better, and tried to be chearful, though it was plain it did not come
<PB N="133" REF="133">from her heart: however, as &s;he has ve|ry good &s;en&s;e, no doubt &s;he will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of overcoming an attachment, that promi&s;es her nothing but unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly &s;orry Harry could not, or would not, return this young lady's regard, as from the character I hear of her temper and di&s;po&s;ition, I am &s;ure they would have been happy. He him|&s;elf &s;ays, &s;he is de&s;erving any man's affection, who had a heart to give.</P>
<P>If you mu&s;t prai&s;e my heroi&s;m, let it be in wi&s;hing and endeavouring to per|&s;uade him to marry; for that I confe&s;s, is a great degree of &s;elf-denial, &s;ince it would of nece&s;&s;ity put an end to that a|greeable intercour&s;e, which at pre&s;ent con|tributes to my happine&s;s: for the friend&s;hip I entertain for him, is the &s;ofte&s;t, mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;entiment, that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined; and the re&s;erve that mu&s;t take place (if he was married) of the delight|ful confidence that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between us, would leave a vacuum in my heart, that would ever remain; yet as his wel|fare is of infinitely more weight with me, than any gratification of my own; I have
<PB N="134" REF="134">&s;incerely wi&s;hed to &s;ee him cured of his unfortunate attachment: but here he is, and I mu&s;t lay down my pen.&mdash;</P>

Then I have &s;omething for your pe|ru&s;al, which, perhaps, you would chu&s;e to mention to her; and put into my hand a &s;hort letter from Charles, which he per|mits me to enclo&s;e, and which I &s;hall leave you to read.

<DATELINE>Hamilton-Hall, <DATE>Dec. 11.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will &s;ee by the date of this, what good effect your advice had on me; &s;ince I am now in the hou&s;e of a man, whom I could &s;carce bear the &s;ight of when I wrote to you la&s;t, but the force of your arguments opened my eyes, and re|&s;tored me in &s;ome degree to my&s;elf, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to enable me to con&s;ider the mat|ter more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately than I had yet done; and the re&s;ult was, that I would pur&s;ue your plan, and, if po&s;&s;ible, get Mr. Hamilton to the ca&s;tle, and ob&s;erve both his and Eliza's behaviour when together, by which means I could judge what founda|tion I had for my doubts, and al&s;o know if they were likely to be removed.</P>
<P>He reminded me by a polite letter of my promi&s;e to &s;pend &s;ome time at his hou&s;e before Chri&s;tmas, and appointed me to meet him at a place he mentioned, to ac|company
<PB N="136" REF="136">him home; I went and ea&s;ily prevailed on him to pa&s;s a few days with me before we &s;et out for Derry; accord|ingly we came directly to the ca&s;tle, where he continued till the 6th when I accompa|nied him to this place, which is perhaps one of the mo&s;t beautifully improved &s;pots in the univer&s;e, and during his ab&s;ence has been kept by his mother in the &s;ame ele|gant order it was left by her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;ubject; by all the ob&s;ervations I could make while Mr. Ha|milton was with me, I am &s;till of opinion he admires Eliza; but as he heard after our fir&s;t meeting how we were circum&s;tanced, I am &s;ure I have nothing to fear from him, unle&s;s he received encouragement from her behaviour, which I could not &s;ee the lea&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend, &s;o that I find my&s;elf at pre&s;ent very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>However, keeping your advice &s;till in mind, I do not not intend to mention ha&s;tening our marriage, till after my re|turn from England, where bu&s;ine&s;s will call me in five or &s;ix weeks at farthe&s;t, but I do not know exactly how long I &s;hall &s;tay there; I &s;uppo&s;e a few months will do
<PB N="137" REF="137">to put matters on a proper footing, which are very indifferently managed by the pre|&s;ent agent; and I think if I find Eliza en|tertains the &s;ame &s;entiments for me when I return, that &s;he has always &s;eemed to do, I &s;hall be cured of tho&s;e jealou&s;ies that have of late interrupted my peace, and will then pre&s;s her to compleat my happine&s;s, which will be very imperfect till I am cer|tain I po&s;&s;e&s;s both her heart and hand.</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer your la&s;t &s;ooner, be|cau&s;e I was quite undetermined how to act, (though in mine I had promi&s;ed to do as you advi&s;ed) till the opportunity of getting Mr. Hamilton to the ca&s;tle &s;o much &s;ooner than I expected, determined me to follow your opinion, which I inclined to all a long, but I feared it would be a length of time before I could &s;ee them together, and I could not bear the &s;u&s;pence I was in long, for it was a &s;tate, I am convinced, infi|nitely wor&s;e than Popi&s;h purgatory. Jea|lou&s;y is the wor&s;t of fiends: Why is it an attendant on &s;o &s;weet a pa&s;&s;ion as love? But you Maun&s;ell are free from it, and yet I know you are a lover!

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 15. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Loui&s;a,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of your's, with the inclo&s;ures, and am much obliged both to you and Mr. Maun&s;ell for giving me the peru&s;al of it: I &s;hall return it with this. I cannot but &s;ay I had better hopes of Charles before I &s;aw it than I have now, for you may ob&s;erve he &s;eems doubtful him|&s;elf, that he &s;hall be able to conquer his weakne&s;s, (as he calls it) from which I in|fer, he &s;till finds it more powerful than he acknowleges, but as he wi&s;hes to be cured, I have hopes he will accompli&s;h it; and if it depends on his finding me in the &s;ame &s;entiments on his return from England, I think I may an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>I now &s;ee the folly of parents endea|vouring to attach children to each other, before they know what their di&s;po&s;itions
<PB N="140" REF="140">will be, for when the affections are &s;trongly engaged it is not ea&s;y to withdraw them; though our rea&s;on may tell us we were not formed to make each other happy; at lea&s;t I find it &s;o, and fear I have a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s before me. You I know would find no difficulty in doing what your rea&s;on dictated; but as Mi&s;s Herbert ob&s;erves, &s;uch fortitude is not common in women; and I think I have even le&s;s of it than others.</P>
<P>That letter has quite depre&s;&s;ed my &s;pirits, which were not very good &s;ince Charles left us, and to make them wor&s;e my mother has been ill the&s;e two days; if &s;he continues &s;o, I &s;hall be frighted to death: I wi&s;h we were &s;afe in Dublin, there I &s;hould have the comfort of your &s;ociety, which would enable me to bear any affliction better than I can do, when un&s;upported by your friendly council.</P>
<P>Though my regard for you and Harry took up all my thoughts when I wrote la&s;t, yet I a&s;&s;ure you Mi&s;s Herbert was not without my pity; but as her liking was but of a &s;hort &s;tanding, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;appointment cannot very greatly affect
<PB N="141" REF="141">her for any time, though at fir&s;t &s;he may feel it &s;everely, as &s;he imagined him di&s;en|gaged, and had no rea&s;on from his beha|viour to expect any ob&s;tacle; however a beginning inclination may &s;oon be conquer|ed.</P>
<P>I do indeed, Loui&s;a, allow you great prai&s;e for your whole conduct; particularly your endeavours to per&s;uade him to marry; &s;ince that is what your heart is mo&s;t re|pugnant to, and I own I cannot help being plea&s;ed at his determination, though I a&s;&s;ent to your opinion in regard to old batchelors; but I think he mu&s;t be happier even in that &s;tate, than married to one woman while he pa&s;&s;ionately loves another, and as that is the ca&s;e, it would be a pity to take from your happine&s;s without adding to his; for certainly in your pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion you enjoy more real &s;atisfaction than any one I ever met with, and I begin to think you have cho&s;en the right road to content; for that mu&s;t be the &s;ure&s;t way that does not depend on the caprice of another.&mdash;Why have not I re&s;olution enough to make the &s;ame choice? and put an end at once to all the anxieties I have &s;uffered, &s;ince I came to the knowlege of
<PB N="142" REF="142">Mr. S&s;keffington's temper; but your good &s;en&s;e enables you to correct that too great &s;en&s;ibility, which is the thing will ever pre|vent me from that happy repo&s;e, (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) that you continually enjoy.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 18.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to find my dear Eliza's &s;pirits are &s;o very low, and reque&s;t you will not give way to that encroaching di&s;order, which if not &s;truggled again&s;t in time, creeps on imperceptibly, and gains &s;uch an a&s;cendant over us that we will not en|deavour to conquer it. I often cautioned you again&s;t encouraging that &s;en&s;ibility, which you allow interrupts your happine&s;s, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw it would do &s;o, and I know if you could make the trial, you might correct it as well as me; it is not the want of &s;en&s;e, but re&s;olution prevents you; you had always a propen&s;ity to indulge melancholy ideas: for my part, I own I do not wi&s;h for &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility as &s;hould make me wretched; for as &s;ome of our female poets, (I do not remember who) expre&s;&s;es it,</P>
<Q><L>"Nor ea&s;e nor peace the heart can know,</L>
<L>That like the needle true,</L>
<PB N="144" REF="144">
<L>Turns at the touch of joy, or woe,</L>
<L>But turning, trembles too."</L></Q>
<P>Yet do not imagine I wi&s;h to &s;tand un|moved at the joys or griefs of my&s;elf or fellow creatures; far from it,&mdash;but then I would chu&s;e to feel them as a chri&s;tian out; I would not be beyond mea&s;ure elated with one, nor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the other: I would moderate my own afflictions by pati|ent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and firm reliance on Provi|dence, and I would endeavour to mitigate tho&s;e of others, by affording either a&s;&s;i&s;tance or con&s;olation as the ca&s;e required, or my abilities extended; though tenderne&s;s of heart is certainly very amiable in a woman, it requires a proper degree of re&s;olution, to prevent its degenerating into weakne&s;s, which it is but too apt to do; fortitude is as becoming in a woman as a man, and quite as nece&s;&s;ary; for how very unfit mu&s;t that woman be to offer con&s;olation to her hu&s;|band, her family, or friends in affliction, that &s;uffers her&s;elf to &s;ink under the mo&s;t trifling di&s;appointment; be&s;ides it betrays &s;uch a di&s;tru&s;t in Providence, to depend on every untoward accident of life, as renders us very unworthy of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, whom we are taught to hope will ex|tricate
<PB N="145" REF="145">us from our difficulties, provided we put a proper confidence in him, and endeavour to de&s;erve his protection. Ex|cu&s;e me, my dear girl, for preaching to you, but I feel my&s;elf &s;o intere&s;ted in your hap|pine&s;s, that I cannot be &s;ilent when I &s;ee you likely to lo&s;e it, merely for want of a little exertion of that under&s;tanding with which heaven has liberally endowed you.</P>
<P>Your mother is not, I dare &s;ay, in any alarming way; and for what relates to Charles, I do not think his letter need ef|fect your &s;pirits &s;o much; for though I grant he is not yet perfectly cured, we may well hope he will, &s;ince he &s;eems de|termined to u&s;e his own efforts for the pur|po&s;e; but I have a great notion his ab&s;ence, more than any thing el&s;e, occa&s;ions your melancholy; at lea&s;t I hope &s;o, for then his return will &s;et all matters to rights. Do pray get out of your lachry mals be|fore you write again; for I fear a few &s;uch letters as your la&s;t would infect me.&mdash;True, Harry is certainly better as he is, if he can|not conquer his pa&s;&s;ion; but what I con|tend for is, he might conquer it if he would try, for I believe pa&s;&s;ion of any kind may be &s;ubdued if we chu&s;e to do it.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="146">
<P>I will tell you why you cannot make the &s;ame re&s;olution I have done, which you &s;eem unable to account for; in the fir&s;t place you are too much in love; and in the &s;econd, the &s;ingle &s;tate is not your choice, nor indeed is it fit for you; you are much too timid to go through life alone, and therefore want &s;ome one on whom you can depend for protection in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs. If any thing happened to &s;eparate Charles and you, it would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for you to make another choice. Now you need not make any prote&s;tations again&s;t it, becau&s;e I do not think it likely the thing will come to pa&s;s; but if it &s;hould, I would have you take a few months to con&s;ider, before you make any declaration of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>I was interrupted by Gertrude, who walked in with a packet of letters in her hand, and plea&s;ure &s;parkling in her eyes; they were from France, &s;he &s;aid, and if I had time, would be glad I would read them before I fini&s;hed my letter, that I might acquaint Mi&s;s Fitzgerald with the contents; I accordingly run them over; there is three of them, one from the count,
<PB N="147" REF="147">one from his &s;on, and another from his daughter, all on the &s;ame &s;ubject; the &s;ub&s;tance is, the count has been informed of his &s;on's inclination, and quite approves it; is only di&s;plea&s;ed he was &s;o long kept ignorant of it.</P>
<P>He has wrote in very genteel terms to Gertrude, hoping, that as &s;he is &s;till un|married &s;he will remain &s;o a while longer if Louis has been &s;o happy as to gain her e&s;teem, as nothing would give him greater plea&s;ure than a union between them; he &s;ays, his &s;on cannot avoid going out with his regiment, and &s;erving one campaign, for his honor is concerned, which he is &s;ure &s;he will think of &s;ufficient importance to to plead his excu&s;e, for not throwing him|&s;elf at her feet immediately, but promi&s;es to obtain leave for him to return as &s;oon as the campaign is over, when he flatters him&s;elf, his behaviour in the field will render him &s;till more worthy her favour.</P>
<P>The young man's letter is truly a love letter, expre&s;&s;ing hopes and fears, grie&s;s and joys, every other word, to the end of a large &s;heet of paper; and concludes with a reque&s;t, that &s;he will now indulge
<PB N="148" REF="148">him with an an&s;wer; a thing &s;he has never yet done, except in her letters to his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Adelaide's joy I think is greater than her brother's, becau&s;e le&s;s intermixed with fears: &s;he mentions this happy change in her father, was brought about by his being at la&s;t convinced by the lady her&s;elf, that &s;he really had refu&s;ed his &s;on; and &s;he a&s;|&s;ured him &s;he would have done &s;o, had he been a king, and of a different religion from her own: this brought the count to hear rea&s;on, and he con&s;ented to &s;ee Louis, who immediately declared his attachment to Gertrude, and obtained his father's ap|probation, who &s;aid, if he had known it before he propo&s;ed the other match for him, it would have &s;aved them all &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, as there could be no objection either to Mi&s;s St. George or her family, who he knew were people of rank.</P>
<P>This has quite &s;atisfied our pride, which I a&s;&s;ure you was up in arms, and we were determined to keep up a proper dignity, in ca&s;e the old gentleman did not con&s;ent with a good grace: you may gue&s;s I en|couraged her in that, as affront of that nature was not to be put up with. So this
<PB N="149" REF="149">love affair is likely to come to the &s;ame end which mo&s;t love affairs do, I mean matri|mony, that is if a cannon ball does not occa&s;ion a more melancholy cata&s;trophe, which I hope will not be the ca&s;e, for Gertrude is a de&s;erving girl, and I &s;hould be be &s;orry to &s;ee her afflicted. I &s;hall have an un&s;peakable lo&s;s when this young Frenchman takes her from me.</P>
<P>I have forborn to mention political tran&s;actions this &s;ome time, as I know you have the mo&s;t material occurrences from Mr. Fitzgerald, and the public prinis; by them you are informed our commons have demanded a FREE TRADE; I do not however give them the credit of it, except tho&s;e few who have uniformly been actu|ated by love of their country; as for the re&s;t they were impelled to it, by the &s;pirit that at pre&s;ent pervades all degrees of people, and which they dare not &s;et them|&s;elves again&s;t: the &s;ame rea&s;on will oblige England to comply, becau&s;e &s;he is not in a &s;ituation to refu&s;e; but I am clear of opinion, that if we do not watch her with unremitting attention, &s;he will, by &s;ome artifice, the fir&s;t convenient opportunity, contrive to render every thing &s;he grants
<PB N="150" REF="150">of no effect, for they are &s;elfi&s;h, illiberal peo|ple, and look with a jealous eye on every advantage enjoyed by their fellow &s;ubjects, either envying their pro&s;perity, or looking on it as &s;o much taken from them; like &s;ome individuals, who are as anxious to detract from other people's merit, as if they thought it would add any thing to their own. To repine at another's pro&s;pe|rity is a mo&s;t odious di&s;po&s;ition, even in private per&s;ons; but it is &s;till wor&s;e, when it is the temper of a whole nation, becau&s;e it then affects millions of people, who are connected with, or dependant on them; and who in con&s;equence, are &s;ure to be oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The uniform conduct of the Engli&s;h towards this kingdom, as well as to Ame|rica, ju&s;tifies my opinion of them; and I dare &s;ay, a little time will &s;hew what de|pendance we can have on their affection, that is, provided we give them an oppor|tunity; for no doubt they will di&s;&s;emble till they are &s;ure of carrying their point.</P>
<P>How &s;ome of the wi&s;e heads would laugh at a girl pretending to give an opinion in politics; it is not, I believe, a very u&s;ual
<PB N="151" REF="151">&s;ubject for young ladies to corre&s;pond on; but I know you have been taught to think, the welfare of our country is of as much con&s;equence to women as men; and when public affairs are the general topic, to write on them is an agreeable variety, and at lea&s;t as improving as intrigue or &s;candal, which the men generou&s;ly allow us to talk of as much as we plea&s;e, and indeed make no bad figure in &s;uch conver&s;ation them|&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Mi&s;s MORTIMER, to Mi&s;s FITZGERALD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 26.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dear Loui&s;a's very agreeable epi&s;tle of the 18th had all the effect you could wi&s;h in re&s;toring my &s;pi|rits; for you point out the folly, and I may &s;ay, impiety of &s;inking under every trivial di&s;tre&s;s in &s;uch forcible language, that I grew a&s;hamed of my own weak|ne&s;s while I read, and have ever &s;ince manife&s;ted &s;uch re&s;ignation and compo|&s;ure, though my mother is confined with the rheumati&s;m, and Charles did not ar|rive till the 22nd, that I am &s;ure you would be a&s;toni&s;hed at my improvement in your Philo&s;ophic Doctrines, joking a-part. I wi&s;h you were always near, to teach me to &s;upport di&s;agreeable accidents with &s;ome degree of re&s;olution: I fear I &s;hall very &s;oon &s;tand in need of all your argu|ments on that head, as the time for Charles going to England advances fa&s;t,
<PB N="154" REF="154">and there is little probability that my mo|ther will be able to go to town before then, as &s;he intended. But I will not anticipate unea&s;ine&s;s, if I can help it.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, according to ancient cu&s;tom, Charles's tenants were entertained in the Great Hall, with roa&s;t beef and plumb|pudding; mine were treated in the &s;ame manner the day before, the Steward and Hou&s;e-keeper doing the honours of the table. My mother was not able to come among&s;t them, which was a great morti|fication to her; but I went, di&s;pon&s;ed my u&s;ual pre&s;ent of a guinea to each of the young girls who was cloathed in her own hou&s;ewifery; and that, you may be &s;ure, was every one that was pre&s;ent; but if on enquiry I found any of them &s;o indu&s;|trious as to help to cloath the younger children of the family, I added a &s;econd guinea, by way of encouragement to her, and to in&s;pire the re&s;t with emulation: a cap and ribbon to each of the little ones, makes them attend both to their book and their needle; and my approbation makes them all compleatly happy; for I often call in at each of their hou&s;es, when I take an airing, and then the mothers in|form me how they go on at &s;chool, and
<PB N="155" REF="155">I prai&s;e or chide them, according to the account I hear.</P>
<P>I pay for the &s;chooling of tho&s;e who&s;e parents cannot well afford it, becau&s;e I think reading and writing may be u&s;eful to them, if they &s;hould happen to be hereafter in any &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s: be&s;ides, they can be better in&s;tructed in religion, if they are able to read the Bible.</P>
<P>Charles accompanied me into the Hall, and chatted with the old folks, while I was di&s;tributing my favours among&s;t the young ones. A large bowl of punch was brought in for them to drink my health, and one of the old men made me look ve|ry &s;idy, by adding a wi&s;h, that their next meeting might be to rejoice on my lady|&s;hip's marriage with his honour: you may think I could not an&s;wer &s;uch a &s;peech, but Charles relieved me by thanking him for his wi&s;h, and hoping he &s;hould &s;ee them very &s;hortly on that happy occa&s;ion. The girls &s;impered, and their mothers finiled: I recovered from my confu&s;ion enough to &s;ay &s;omething kind to them all, and then left them to enjoy their mirth the re&s;t of the evening; and diverted my mo|ther
<PB N="156" REF="156">with what had pa&s;&s;ed, who was ra|ther inclined to be low-&s;pirited at being un|able to go down to them, for &s;he u&s;ed to take great delight in &s;eeing them all &s;o happy; and has made it a reque&s;t, that I will never drop the cu&s;tom, which I could ea&s;ily promi&s;e, as it is quite agreeable to my inclination.</P>
<P>Charles's behaviour, &s;ince he returned from Hamilton-Hall, is ju&s;t what it u&s;ed to be, before he di&s;covered any &s;ymptoms of that unhappy failing, which has this while pa&s;t interrupted our peace; but I dare not flatter my&s;elf his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;i|tion will hold, as his letter to Mr. Maun|&s;ell &s;hews, how doubtful he is about it.</P>
<P>I rejoice to hear Gertrude's little Novel is likely to conclude to her &s;atisfaction; though to be &s;ure, his ab&s;ence will give her much unea&s;ine&s;s; but &s;omething may happen to occa&s;ion his return &s;ooner than &s;he expects; there may be a peace, or ce&s;&s;ation, not that there is now any ap|pearance of it; but &s;he mu&s;t hope the be&s;t. She will, indeed, be a great lo&s;s to you; you &s;hould think of &s;ome one to &s;upply her place; for it will not be plea&s;ing for
<PB N="157" REF="157">you to be alone, nor you need not, as you have &s;everal young relations, who, I dare &s;ay, would like well to be with you.</P>
<P>Your bit of Poetry was happily cho&s;en to illu&s;trate your own &s;entiments; I am convinced you are perfectly right, not to let your &s;en&s;ibility run away with your happine&s;s, and &s;incerely wi&s;h, I could fol|low your example, but fear I have not &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient for the pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>I am of your opinion, both as to our own Parliament and the Engli&s;h nation, and I find cou&s;in James thinks as you do; for in one of his letters, he &s;ays, "There is no doubt but our demands will be granted, as it would be too dangerous to refu&s;e them; but I am &s;ure England will &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity to render her conce&s;&s;ions abor|tive." I hope we may all find our&s;elves mi&s;taken; yet I am afraid we &s;hall prove too good politicians in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I know mo&s;t men di&s;approve of women pretending to any opinion on the&s;e &s;ub|jects; but the men of your family and mine were above that vulgar prejudice,
<PB N="158" REF="158">and took pains to make us capable of judging with &s;ome degree of preci&s;ion; and I think we are obliged to them for it, &s;ince it enables us to conver&s;e &s;ometimes on matters of importance, and not be al|ways confined to triflles; a little of each is agreeable.</P>
<P>I wonder the men are not more di&s;creet in their behaviour before &s;trangers, for I &s;hould think it not plea&s;ing to them&s;elves to have their attachments public, before they know how they will be received: mo&s;t men look on it as very mortifying to be refu&s;ed, and would think them&s;elves very ill treated if the lady &s;hould publi&s;h it; though they &s;carce ever fail of making it known to every body, they make very little u&s;e of their under&s;tanding on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. James is a &s;triking proof of it, for by what you &s;ay, a giddy lad could not be more fooli&s;h; and yet in every o|ther circum&s;tance of life, he is quite a pat|tern of propriety of manners; and it cer|tainly is far from that to draw people's eyes on Emily, and &s;et them telling of her &s;e|cond marriage, before &s;he is out of her weeds: why do not you &s;peak to him a|bout it? but indeed, as it is a fault, or a
<PB N="159" REF="159">folly (call it which you plea&s;e) mo&s;t of them are guilty of, I &s;uppo&s;e they cannot help it.</P>
<P>Charles has ju&s;t got a letter from Eng|land, which, he &s;ays, will ha&s;ten his de|parture; he talks of going in two or three days, and all your le&s;&s;ons are in&s;ufficient to make me hear it with any compo&s;ure; all I could do was, to re&s;train my tears till he had quitted the room. I can only add, that I am your's,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mi&s;s FITZGERALD, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Dec. 27. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WRITE to me, my dear Loui&s;a, and comfort me if you can; for when you receive this, I &s;hall be a wretched creature, as you will ea&s;ily believe, when I tell you it will be delivered by Mr. Skeffington, on his way to England.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you could in&s;pire me with a lit|tle of your fortitude, to enable me to part him with any degree of compo&s;ure, for I fear to expo&s;e my weakne&s;s to my mother, who is very ill, and is, you know, greatly affected by every thing that af|flicts me; &s;o kind is this tender parent. However, as he does not &s;et out till to|morrow, I will endeavour to conquer my folly before then, or at lea&s;t to conceal it.</P>
<P>I once thought of per&s;uading him to go through Scotland, to avoid the dan|ger
<PB N="161" REF="161">of the &s;ea between Dublin and the Head, but on recollection I did not men|tion it, for it occurred to me, he would hazard his life as much in a long journey, this inclement &s;ea&s;on, in a very &s;evere cli|mate. Yet if the air does but move a blade of gra&s;s, my heart dies within me, at the idea of the &s;hip's being da&s;hed a|gain&s;t the rocks; or what would be &s;till wor&s;e, it's foundering at &s;ea, for then he would have no chance of e&s;caping. In &s;hort, I have a thou&s;and fears, and from the terror I feel at parting, am half per|&s;uaded, we &s;hall never meet again.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h he would not go, but I am a|&s;hamed to hint my wi&s;hes, as I know he has material bu&s;ine&s;s: it is very unfortu|nate for me, that I have been from my infancy u&s;ed to his company, as it makes me unable to bear a &s;eparation with any degree of fortitude, though I know the nece&s;&s;ity of it, and fear that nece&s;&s;ity will often recur; but what one has been long accu&s;tomed to, grows habitual, and is not ea&s;ily conquered.</P>
<P>My father's death, which I can but ju&s;t remember, occa&s;ioned my mother' break|ing
<PB N="162" REF="162">up hou&s;e, and going to live with her brother, who&s;e wife being dead, they thought it would be more plea&s;ing to both, as each had but one child, and they too young to be their companions; and the &s;ociety of tho&s;e to whom we are attached, by any tender ties, whether of blood or affection, is very de&s;irable.</P>
<P>My mother and uncle found it &s;o agree|able, that they continued together till death (as you know) deprived us of him about two years &s;ince.</P>
<P>The education of Charles and me took up the greate&s;t part of their attention; and as they were both too fond of us, to bear us for any length of time out of their &s;ight, they determined to employ proper teachers for us in the hou&s;e, and have us in&s;tructed under their own eye; by which means we were continually to|gether, and indeed, never wi&s;hed to part, which, I believe, was the very thing our parents had in view. However, though I think a home education, where proper in&s;tructors can be afforded, is by far the mo&s;t preferable for a woman; it has great inconveniencies with regard to men, as it &s;ends them into the world totally unac|quainted
<PB N="163" REF="163">with all its ways, and of cour&s;e liable to be impo&s;ed on, by the fir&s;t that &s;hall find it worth their while to make a dupe of them, which is another of my fears, on Charles's account; for I know good &s;en&s;e, without a knowlege of man|kind, is not &s;ufficient to guard and un&s;u&s;|pecting mind, again&s;t the wiles that are practi&s;ed by both &s;exes, to &s;educe the young and inexperienced into their nets.</P>
<P>But why do I teize you with my fool|i&s;h fears? yet write to me, if it be but to chide my weakne&s;s; for I have no one here, either to con&s;ole or advi&s;e me, and you know what a timid creature I am, and how very ea&s;ily my &s;pirits are de|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>"Oh! what pain it is to part."&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT a tragedy has my dear Eliza wrote on the departure of Mr. Skeffington: no Hereine of Romance ever lamented the ab&s;ence of her Swain in more pathetic terms. How could the barbarous man think any bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ufficient mo|ment to be preferred to LOVE and you? I hope, however, he has the excu&s;e of not knowing how deeply you were af|fected at his going, which I am apt to think was the ca&s;e, as I never &s;aw him more lively than he was the few hours he pa&s;&s;ed with me, in his way through Dublin.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, keep him in ignoranc, if you wi&s;h to maintain any degree of con|&s;equence in his opinion; for men are as &s;ubject to vanity as women, and quite as
<PB N="165" REF="165">ready to make a bad u&s;e of their power over the heart they are &s;ure of.</P>
<P>Now for my part, &s;uch a thought would never have occurred to me, as not &s;eeing him again, any more than the perils and dangers of a voyage from this to Holy-Head, which you have painted in &s;uch di&s;|mal colours, as would make one's heart ach, in anticipating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a &s;hip|wreck; if we did not luckily recollect, that the thing &s;carce ever happens. I thank heaven, my nerves are not of &s;uch a delicate texture; or my heart is not &s;o tender as your's, el&s;e I &s;hould be wretched &s;omething more than three-fourths of the year; for about &s;o long am I without &s;ee|ing Harry: yet I bear it with great phi|lo&s;ophy, and even think the plea&s;ure of meeting, which we could not know with|out parting, far out-balances any unea&s;i|ne&s;s that may give; it is quite an Epicu|ri&s;m in Love, of which you can have no idea, becau&s;e you have not yet experienc|ed it. Indeed I do not &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;i|ble to keep an attachment alive for any length of time, without frequent &s;epara|tions; it would be quite as dull as being married to the man, to have him like a fixture in your hou&s;e, never to be moved:
<PB N="166" REF="166">but when he has been a while away, he has a thou&s;and things to tell you; ten thou&s;and &s;oft profe&s;&s;ions of con&s;tancy to make; and in &s;hort, one feels &s;uch agree|able &s;en&s;ations, that when you come to en|joy that refined plea&s;ure, you will agree with me, that being perpetually together, is the mo&s;t in&s;ipid thing in the world.</P>
<P>I hope this reflection will make you &s;ub|mit with a better grace to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ometimes parting from this idol of your heart, as you probably mu&s;t do it often, &s;ince his e&s;tate in England will, no doubt, require his pre&s;ence at lea&s;t once a year, to &s;ee that ju&s;tice is done, both to his tenants and him&s;elf: now he is nearly at age, you mu&s;t expect he will attend to his own bu|&s;ine&s;s. I &s;hould hope your good &s;en&s;e would prevent your wi&s;hing him to act otherwi&s;e; as the large&s;t fortune cannot hold out again&s;t the neglect of its owner, but will, by degrees, wa&s;te away; and mo&s;t probably fall into the hands of tho&s;e to who&s;e care it was committed: &s;o that your own intere&s;t, which will &s;hortly be con|nected with his, &s;hould keep you from en|couraging him to indolence, a fault which men of rank are too apt to fall into, with regard to their own affairs.</P>
<PB N="167" REF="167">
<P>I &s;hall conclude like all other preachers, by de&s;iring you to con&s;ider what has been &s;aid, and I hope your next letter will con|vince me it has had a proper effect: give your rea&s;on fair play, and I am &s;ure it mu&s;t. Farewel, my &s;weet friend, &s;ays,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your LOUISA MORTIMER.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>It being late, I was in &s;uch ha&s;te to con|clude, that I forgot to take notice of one of your fears, though I think it the lea&s;t groundle&s;s of any you mention; that is, the danger your cou&s;in may fall into from his ignorance of the world. I con|fe&s;s, I think it more than probable his pur&s;e will &s;mart for it, if he makes any &s;tay in London, where all kinds of &s;harping is brought to a degree of perfection, (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) that is yet unparal|lelled, and where a dangerous glo&s;s is put on every vice. However, as he has good &s;en&s;e, and good principles, I hope he will come off with the lo&s;s only of a little money, and he will know more of mankind by the time he goes there again.</P>
<PB N="168" REF="168">
<P>I am much concerned for your good mo|ther's indi&s;po&s;ition, and wi&s;h &s;he was able to come to town, which would be a more eli|gible place for you both than where you are.

<P>I HOPE my dear Eliza has, by this time, &s;uffered her rea&s;on to get the better of her fooli&s;h fears, and that &s;he is enough compo&s;ed to be a&s;hamed of them. Fool|i&s;h I mu&s;t call them, becau&s;e they were groundle&s;s, and conjured up by your own imagination, merely for an excu&s;e to make your&s;elf wretched. I could not help &s;mil|ing at your giving me &s;uch a long account of the manner you were brought up toge|ther, as if I had been quite ignorant of it; but as you were making it an excu&s;e for your being &s;o unrea&s;onably affected at parting, I &s;uppo&s;e you cho&s;e to refre&s;h my memory on every particular circum&s;tance, that it might the better plead your apolo|gy, which was natural enough in you; when you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, you &s;tood in
<PB N="170" REF="170">need of every excu&s;e that could be made. However, I take it for granted, you have e'er now, recovered your &s;en&s;es, which were certainly &s;u&s;pended for a while, and are capable of reflecting on the bad con|&s;equence of letting any pa&s;&s;ion get &s;o powerful a dominion over you, as quite to overwhelm your under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A man of &s;en&s;e, though it may flatter his vanity to be &s;o extravagantly beloved, would not be much delighted to have his wife &s;o mi&s;erable when he was out of her &s;ight, as it would be a continual draw|back on his enjoyments, if he had any regard for her; and a man that had either &s;en&s;e or affection, would have it always in his power to make you unhappy.</P>
<P>Harry could not conceal his a&s;toni&s;h|ment, when I read your letter to him.</P>
<P>Sure, &s;ays he, <Q REND="margQuotes">Mr. Skeffington does not know how tenderly he is beloved, or he could not harbour &s;uch jealou&s;ies.</Q> But, added he, <Q>perhaps he may fear &s;he is too &s;u&s;ceptible, for that is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e.&mdash;</Q></P>
<PB N="171" REF="171">
<P>I leave you to con&s;ider whether it be prudent to give room to &s;uch an idea.</P>
<P>You will, I doubt not, hear from Charles in a few days, for he has as fair a wind as can blow; and to be &s;ure he will write as &s;oon as he lands at the Head. He begged I would advi&s;e you to get your mother to town, whenever &s;he was able to bear the journey; for he cannot be ea&s;y till he hears you have left the ca&s;|tle, as he knows how lonely you mu&s;t be, &s;ince you lo&s;t the Boyle's, and every one el&s;e will be coming to Dublin, when the Holy-Days are over.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed to mention it to you, but told him, I was &s;ure your own inclination would bring you the in&s;tant your mother could venture to move.</P>
<P>Harry and he walked out together, and had, I find, a deal of conver&s;ation on the old &s;ubject. He &s;eemed convinced that rea&s;on did not warrant his &s;u&s;picions; but &s;aid, Love or Jealou&s;y had little to do with rea&s;on; and when he con&s;idered Mr. Ha|milton's accompli&s;hments, and knew that
<PB N="172" REF="172">he liked Eliza, he could not help fearing &s;he might think too favourably of him; but &s;aid he, if I find no alteration in her &s;entiments when I return, I think I &s;hall be quite ea&s;y; &s;o there it re&s;ts; and as it depends on that circum&s;tance, I fancy you have nothing to dread.</P>

<P>MY dear Loui&s;a's very agreeable let|ter, &s;hewed me to my&s;elf in &s;uch a ridiculous light, that I could not forbear laughing as I read it. I que&s;tion, howe|ver, if it would have all the effect you wi&s;hed, had not the &s;ame po&s;t brought a letter from Charles, informing me of his &s;afe arrival at the Head, which, as it made my mind ea&s;y, rendered me more capable of attending to your arguments; and they are, I confe&s;s, unan&s;werable; but though my rea&s;on is convinced, I cannot conquer my folly, and fear I &s;hall have frequent returns of what you call the Horrors, du|ring Mr. Skeffington's ab&s;ence; all I can

<P>You tell me, with what philo&s;ophy you bear Mr. Maun&s;ell's ab&s;ence, greate&s;t part of the year; you might too, have remind|ed me, of the patience with which you re|&s;igned him at your father's de&s;ire; when your affection for him was at the highe&s;t, and I could only have an&s;wered, that to follow your example, required more for|titude than I am mi&s;tre&s;s of: but when I go to town, you &s;hall read lectures to me on the &s;ubject, and I will be all attention, till I become what you wi&s;h me.

I grant I am; but can you, Loui&s;a, expect I &s;hould ever love another, after being &s;o cruelly di&s;appoint|ed in him, that has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my heart &s;ince I was a child?

<P>NO, indeed, I did not expo&s;e my dear Eliza's weakne&s;s, my regard for her is too &s;incere; and if it was not, my parti|ality to my own Sex, would prevent my letting any of the fellows (not excepting Harry Maun&s;ell) know that an attachment to one of them, could make a good, &s;en|&s;ible girl, behave like a fool, on the tri|fling occa&s;ion of parting with him for a month or two. I only took that method to convince you, you were wrong, by the di&s;tre&s;s I knew you would feel on the &s;up|po&s;ition of its being known to any one but me. Do not, however, think, that what I &s;aid was merely my own words; for I a&s;&s;ure you, I have heard Harry, as well as other men, make the ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="179" REF="179">that people who are very &s;u&s;ceptible, were u&s;ually very fickle al&s;o; being &s;ub|ject to tender impre&s;&s;ions, for every plea&s;|ing object they meet with. Though I know you are an exception to this rule, yet if Mr. Skeffington happens to be of tho&s;e &s;entiments, his jealou&s;y is ea&s;ily ac|counted for; not having an high opinion of him&s;elf, it is natural enough for him to fear a more accompli&s;hed per&s;on may &s;upplant him.</P>
<P>If you think this likely to be the ca&s;e, no doubt it will be a &s;tronger motive with you to correct the too great tender|ne&s;s of your heart, than any I could of|fer, and I hope we &s;hall have no occa&s;i|on to renew the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzgerald is become a violent fa|vourite with Mr. O'Neil; they met here, (for the old gentleman frequently vi&s;its me) and James, artfully enough, accom|modated him&s;elf to his opinions, which are rather &s;ingular; and &s;o plea&s;ed him, that he received an invitation to call in and play Back-gammon whenever he had an hour to &s;pare. I believe he goes there two or three times a week, and lo&s;es every game
<PB N="180" REF="180">he plays, for he has no &s;kill at it, and pretends a great de&s;ire to be in&s;tructed by Mr. O'Neil, who prides him&s;elf on be|ing an adept in whatever was fa&s;hionable in his younger days; and thinks the pre|&s;ent age degenerated in every thing, even their amu&s;ements; a common notion among&s;t old people, who mi&s;take their own incapacity to enjoy amu&s;ement, for &s;ome defect in the entertainment it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was, however, no bad policy in your cou&s;in to ingratiate him&s;elf there; for if he can gain her father's approbation, it will go a great way in recommending him to Emily, who is a perfect pattern of obe|dience; but I fancy it will take time to bring that matter about.</P>
<P>Gertrude an&s;wered all the letters from the family of Rou&s;illon, in REALLY a very pretty manner; I am &s;ure I could not have wrote half &s;o well on the &s;ubject, but you young ladies, who are &s;o conver|&s;ant in Love matters, are never at a lo&s;s on your favourite theme.</P>
<P>I doubt not if Louis will get her letter, as &s;he had one from him ye&s;terday, dated
<PB N="181" REF="181">on board the fleet, which was only wait|ing for &s;ailing orders; &s;o &s;he has had a mo&s;t rueful countenance ever &s;ince, and we are all employed in diverting, or ra|ther laughing her out of her di&s;mals: to do her ju&s;tice, though &s;he bears it very well, for &s;he does not torment her&s;elf with far-fetched terrors, but as he is going into very imminent dangers, one cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;he is affected by it.</P>

<P>ONLY think, Eliza, how unexpectedly things come about, and learn to de&s;|pend on the wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of events. What Gertrude could not have hoped for in le&s;s than a year, is now come to pa&s;s in a moment, as one may call it, and that by the very means which &s;he thought &s;uch a formidable bar to her wi&s;hes; I mean the young Count being ordered abroad. But to be a little methodical, (a thing I am not much ad|dicted to) as I &s;at reading this morning in my dre&s;&s;ing room, where we u&s;ually break|fa&s;t, waiting for the two ladies who had not yet appeared, Jenny announced the arrival of a &s;trange gentleman, who, &s;he &s;aid, &s;eemed to be a foreigner, and enquired for me; &s;he had &s;hewn him into the par|lour, and I cho&s;e to go to him rather than a&s;k him up, it was &s;uch an early hour; his back was to me as I went in, but when he turned his &s;trong re&s;emblance to the pic|ture
<PB N="184" REF="183">I &s;aw with Gertrude, at once inform|ed me who he was, before he had time to &s;peak; and I a&s;ked him had I not the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing the Count de Rou|&s;illon? he an&s;wered he was the per&s;on, but could not gue&s;s by what means I came to know him, which I &s;oon explained; and he proceeded to inform me that the fleet had been but three days from France, when a violent &s;torm aro&s;e which &s;eparated them, and the ve&s;&s;el he was in having &s;uffered greatly during the gale, was endeavouring to make the port they had &s;o lately quitted, when they were attacked by an Engli&s;h frigate, to which they were obliged to &s;trike, not being in a condition to fight, and were brought into Cork; from whence he had come on parole, to pay his devoirs to my lovely kin&s;woman, but not wi&s;hing to &s;urpri&s;e her, had taken the liberty of fir&s;t introducing him&s;elf to me. He concluded with &s;aying, though he was di&s;appointed of the glory he promi&s;ed him&s;elf in the campaign, his love would not &s;uffer him to call the accident a misfortune, &s;ince it would be the means of procuring him the happine&s;s he had long &s;ighed for.</P>
<P>As I know the happine&s;s he meant was Gertrude's pre&s;ence, I was not &s;o unfeeling
<PB N="185" REF="184">to deprive him of that plea&s;ure long, and thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to prepare her a little, as his delicate caution had hinted, I went up and met her ju&s;t quitting her chamber; we came to my dre&s;&s;ing room together, and by degrees I let her know who was in the hou&s;e: her agitation was &s;o great I thought &s;he would have fainted, and calling for help, in ran her maid in as bad a &s;tate as her mi&s;tre&s;s, having got a glimp&s;e of the Count, and &s;uppo&s;ing it was his gho&s;t; the fooli&s;h girl ran about the room like one frantic, crying out, O! madam, the Count! the Count! Her exclamations helped to rou&s;e Gertrude, and brought Emily into the room, who &s;tood &s;taring at us all, to|tally unable to account for &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, till the Count him&s;elf hearing the hurry, no longer able to check his impatience, and following the &s;ound of our voices, flew into the room, and cla&s;ping Gertrude in his arms, &s;aid a thou&s;and tender things which explained the my&s;tery to Emily, and re|lieved Sally from her terrors, who had on his fir&s;t appearance covered her face with her apron, to avoid &s;eeing what &s;he firmly believed to be a &s;pirit.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of &s;uch an un|expected interview had &s;ub&s;ided, the Count
<PB N="186" REF="185">gracefully apologized for the freedom he he had taken; and Gertrude who was blu&s;hing to death at having &s;o quietly per|mitted it, would, I believe, have remained &s;ilent till now, if I had not relieved her by &s;aying I would venture to engage for his pardon, as I &s;aw in her eyes &s;he was not mortally offended; therefore I hoped he would be able to partake of our breakfa&s;t, and I &s;eated my&s;elf at the table; they all followed my example, and Sally being re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es, paid her tribute of joy on the happy occa&s;ion, (for &s;he knew the whole affair) and withdrew, leaving us to enjoy a little rational conver&s;ation, and compo&s;e our&s;elves after the hurry of &s;pirits &s;ome of us had undergone.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily excu&s;e Gertrude for any little imprudence &s;he committed in attaching her&s;elf to this young man, without know|ing how either of their friends would reli&s;h it, for he is &s;o perfectly amiable in his per&s;on, and his &s;entiments &s;o uncommon|ly refined, as I could ob&s;erve from the little conver&s;ation I have had with him, that it would require a large &s;hare of &s;toi|ci&s;m to li&s;ten to his &s;oft tale with indiffer|ence, provided one was free from any other prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="187" REF="186">
<P>He is of the fine&s;t &s;tile of manly beauty, both as to face and per&s;on; much &s;uperior to his picture, which is very hand&s;ome too; but he was quite a &s;tripling when that was drawn; and Gertrude &s;ays, he is amazing|ly improved in his form.</P>
<P>He has all the agreeable vivacity of his country, tempered by an excellent under|&s;tanding; in &s;hort, I am a little in love with him my&s;elf, and quite entertained with his chat, for he &s;peaks broken Engli&s;h di|vinely, and gives it &s;uch a &s;oftne&s;s as makes it wonderfully plea&s;ing; it is what the language much wants; its native ac|cent is &s;o very tart, it always gives me an idea of &s;colding, &s;o that in my mind a &s;oft Mun&s;ter brogue is an improvement to it, provided it be not a vulgar one.</P>
<P>As he did not like continuing at a Hotel, I &s;ent Jenny to take a lodging for him near this, and &s;he got a hand&s;ome apartment in the next &s;treet, with which he is greatly plea&s;ed; Harry Maun&s;ell to who&s;e care I have recommended him, attended him home ju&s;t now, for he was ea&s;ily pre|vailed on to &s;tay all day with his adorable.</P>
<PB N="188" REF="187">
<P>Harry will introduce him to all the men of genteel rank, and takes him to all the places worth &s;eeing; it was lucky enough that he happened to be in town.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay the Count will not think of leaving this till he takes Gertrude with him; &s;o if you wi&s;h to be at the wedding you mu&s;t not make much delay in the country; for I expect we &s;hall be put all into a hurry when he gets letters from home. As he has wrote from Cork, it is not to be doubted but he has a&s;ked per|mi&s;&s;ion to conclude an affair &s;o intere&s;ting to him while he is here.</P>
<P>Gertrude has been &s;o prettily fluttered all day, that if it was not for a little of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he would not have been able to &s;tammer out a &s;ingle &s;entence of common &s;en&s;e; but when I &s;aw her likely to make a very &s;illy figure, I &s;topt her &s;hort with &s;ome very ridiculous ob&s;ervation, that drew the laugh upon me, and gave her &s;ome time to recollect her&s;elf, by which means I &s;aved her from a good deal of raillery, which I &s;aw Harry and your cou&s;in James was much inclined to;
<PB N="189" REF="188">as they pre&s;ently di&s;covered how matters &s;tood between her and the Count: indeed her own confu&s;ion would have betrayed the &s;ecret, if his particular attention to her had not done it.</P>
<P>Surely this letter will di&s;pel your me|lancholy ideas, and teach you to think every thing will turn out for the be&s;t, if our own perver&s;ene&s;s does not prevent it.</P>
<P>Mr. Skeffington's &s;udden departure, and your con&s;equent low &s;pirits, having given me a &s;ubject for my two la&s;t epi&s;tles, I forgot to tell you, I was quite plea&s;ed with your account of the method by which you encourage your tenants children, to indu&s;|try as well as to the learning that is nece&s;|&s;ary for them; and I agree with you, in regard to the advantage of their knowing how to read, though I have heard people argue again&s;t it; but I never heard them &s;ay any thing convincing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that your mother &s;hould be mortified at not being able to go among&s;t them, as was her cu&s;tom during &s;o many years; and to a mind like hers it
<PB N="190" REF="189">mu&s;t give &s;ingular &s;atisfaction to &s;ee &s;o many people chearful and happy, whom &s;he knows &s;he contributes to make &s;o; it is well for them, and I am &s;ure, a great plea&s;ure to her, that you are di&s;po&s;ed to follow her example.</P>

<P>HOW kind is my dear Loui&s;a to take &s;o much pains to amu&s;e me, as well as to rea&s;on me out of my melancholy; it would be ungrateful if I would not let her endeavours &s;ucceed, by &s;econding them with my own efforts, e&s;pecially when I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to the force of your arguments; they had &s;uch an effect that I was growing quite chearful, when, (I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to tell you) an unlucky dream, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, as rendered me totally unfit to write to you for two days, which was the cau&s;e of my not an|&s;wering your's of the 6th &s;ooner. Do not however be very angry with me, &s;ince I acknowledge my own folly, and have got the better of it, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent: be&s;ides you know my mother, who is in
<PB N="192" REF="191">other re&s;pects a &s;en&s;ible woman, has great faith in dreams which is &s;ome little apology for me.</P>
<P>I never heard Charles &s;ay any thing, that gave me room to think he was of the &s;ame opinion which you &s;ay Mr. Maun&s;ell, and many other men are; but if we ever meet again I will try to di&s;cover his &s;en|timents, and be that as it will, I will cer|tainly try to correct what is ami&s;s in my own di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I did not think James had &s;o much art, and though it is a talent I do not much approve in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I cannot help wi&s;hing him &s;ucce&s;s; for &s;ince Emily does not di&s;like him, it is no harm to u&s;e a little artifice to obtain her father's good graces.&mdash; Your's of the 8th is ju&s;t brought me, I mean I have ju&s;t read it, and heartily con|gratulate Gertrude on the agreeable acci|dent that has put an end to all her fears. It is indeed a proof that we &s;hould never de&s;pond, let our pro&s;pect be ever &s;o dark, &s;ince the &s;cene may be changed in a mo|ment when we lea&s;t expect it; though &s;triking the in&s;tance, it is probable I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it over unnoticed, if
<PB N="193" REF="192">your judicious ob&s;ervations had not point|ed it out to me, with intention, I know, that I &s;hould profit by it, which I hope I &s;hall.</P>
<P>I read part of your letter to my mother, who was highly plea&s;ed both with your &s;erious reflexions, and your &s;prightly de|&s;cription of the confu&s;ion the Count's arrival occa&s;ioned in your family. Sally's terror diverted us much; I cannot but &s;ay it was natural enough in the girl, who thought he was on his way to America, to be frightened at his &s;udden appearance, and concluded it was &s;omething &s;uperna|tural; for I dare &s;ay, &s;he is quite con|vinced that Gho&s;ts are continually &s;talking about the world.</P>
<P>Your picture of the Count is very cap|tivating, and does great credit to Gertrude's choice; I &s;hall be horridly di&s;appointed if he leaves Dublin before I get there, at pre|&s;ent I cannot judge when that will be, my mother's health is &s;o uncertain, &s;ometimes better, &s;ometimes wor&s;e; though on the whole, &s;he is not near &s;o bad as &s;he was, becau&s;e &s;he is not &s;o bad for a con&s;tancy; therefore I am in hopes &s;he will recover
<PB N="194" REF="193">time enough for me to be at the wedding, as there mu&s;t be letters from France, and &s;everal preliminaries &s;ettled before it comes to that.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urprized that Gertrude was &s;o much fluttered; had I been in her place it would have half killed me, but &s;he is not &s;uch a weak creature as I am, though her form is very delicate.</P>
<P>I like as well as you to hear foreigners &s;peak Engli&s;h; they give &s;omething I can|not de&s;cribe to the language, which im|proves it prodigiou&s;ly. I &s;uppo&s;e you are partial to the Mun&s;ter brogue, becau&s;e Harry Maun&s;ell is of that Province; not that I think he has more of the accent than ju&s;t what is agreeable; no doubt you think &s;o too, and therefore give it the pre|ference.</P>

<P>I do but laugh at his rueful face, and tell him, &s;ituated as we are, it is ab&s;o|lutely ridiculous to &s;ee him always at my elbow; be&s;ides it is not in nature to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of flirting with a French man, they do it &s;o agreeably.

<PB N="199" REF="198">I did not revive his &s;pirits by a &s;weet &s;mile, which he interprets to his own liking, I &s;hould be a little afraid he would be found hanging in his garters: it is mighty &s;illy however in him, to in|dulge him&s;elf in &s;uch a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; the&s;e &s;ort of early entanglements &s;ome|times prevent the happine&s;s of our future lives, we &s;hould be therefore very cautious of a fir&s;t attachment; but the mi&s;chief is, we are en&s;nared be|fore we think of the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Perhaps I may be a little partial to the Mun&s;ter accent; nothing extraordi|nary that, &s;ince it has been made plea&s;ing to my ear, by my fir&s;t hearing the &s;oft language of love in that tone, to which I think it is exceedingly well adapted; no doubt the northern ac|cent is mu&s;ic to you.</P>
<P>I expect to hear in your next Charles is &s;afe arrived in London, for you may have had a letter from him by this time.&mdash;This unmerciful Frenchman thinks we &s;hould never be weary of public amu&s;ements, and is continually hurrying us from one to another, till I am

<P>I ACKNOWLEGE my dear Loui&s;a is not only the mo&s;t punctual, but the mo&s;t agreeable corre&s;pondent I could po&s;&s;ibly have, and I might add, the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, without being accu&s;ed of flattery; for any one who &s;aw your letters mu&s;t allow, more per&s;ua&s;ive ar|guments cannot be advanced, than what you &s;et forth to engage me to conquer the little weakne&s;&s;es of my di&s;po&s;ition. I am thankful for your kind intentions, and determined to follow your advice and example, and become a rational creature as fa&s;t as I can, or I find I am likely to be very unhappy, &s;ince one &s;hould in this life meet perpetual cau&s;e for unea&s;ine&s;s, if, as I have done, they
<PB N="202" REF="201">always look at the wor&s;t &s;ide of every event, and give them&s;elves up to fruitle&s;s repinings: I will therefore try to fortify my mind again&s;t di&s;agreeable circum&s;tan|ces, as I think it very probable I &s;hall have &s;ome &s;uch to encounter, from that unfortunate defect in Charle's temper, which he &s;eems him&s;elf to have &s;uch doubts of conquering.</P>
<P>I have had a letter from him &s;ince I wrote to you; he was in London, but meant to leave it next day and &s;et out for Su&s;&s;ex, to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s he went on. He took over young McNeil, and will &s;ettle him there as his agent, &s;ince he is of tried integrity; and the per&s;on that hitherto managed his Engli&s;h e&s;tate, has certainly not been hone&s;t.</P>
<P>When Charles has concluded his bu|&s;ine&s;s he will return to London, and &s;ee every thing that is worth &s;eeing there, before his return: but a month, he &s;ays, will be more than &s;ufficient for that; and he hopes to find me in Dublin, as he will not go to the ca&s;tle till &s;ummer, unle&s;s my mother's illne&s;s &s;hould detain me there longer than we expected. He
<PB N="203" REF="202">&s;ays the Engli&s;h women are hand&s;ome, and in general, fairer than the Iri&s;h; yet he gives the prefernce to his country-women, for the mode&s;t &s;weetne&s;s of their looks.</P>
<P>I cannot but join with Mr. Maun&s;ell, in thinking it rather cruel of you to give another the plea&s;ure of attending you, when you know it would make him happy, e&s;pecially &s;ince (as he ob&s;erves) it is the only happine&s;s he is likely to enjoy with you; and be&s;ides, he &s;eldom has opportunity for that; being the greate&s;t part of his time &s;eparated from you; that I think he de&s;erves &s;ome little con&s;ideration: but I believe, my dear Loui&s;a has now and then a &s;mall pro|pen&s;ity towards flirting.</P>
<P>But pray how does Gertrude approve of your engaging the Count? I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would not be much obliged to you for the exchange, as it is likely Mr. Maun&s;ell is not at &s;uch times a very chearful companion, though he is u&s;ually extremely plea&s;ing. I allow his con|&s;tancy to you, who have cru&s;ed all his hopes, is no great proof of his wi&s;dom,
<PB N="204" REF="203">but I would be glad to know, who that loved was ever wi&s;e except your&s;elf, and we cannot expect to meet with prodi|gies often. You advi&s;e me to what mo&s;t people would think a bad remedy for low &s;pirits; to vi&s;it the afflicted: I always thought &s;o my&s;elf, and therefore avoided it, though my pur&s;e was al|ways open to tho&s;e who applied to me: however I have &s;uch an opinion of your judgement, that I am re&s;olved to try what effect it will have. On con|&s;ideration, I believe you are quite right, for they mu&s;t have very little huma|nity that would not forget their own afflictions, when they &s;aw others &s;uf|fering much greater; and very little religion, that would not be thankful to Heaven for exempting them from &s;uch calamities.</P>
<P>The obvious con&s;equence is, one will be a&s;hamed to complain of trifling ills.&mdash; Why could not I think of that be|fore? but you &s;ee by it how much I need your in&s;tructions, and that they do carry conviction, though they did not take effect all at once: &s;o I hope you will not give up an office, you
<PB N="205" REF="204">are &s;o capable of; for without your advice, I feel that I &s;houl often act very fooli&s;hly.</P>
<P>Your arguments again&s;t believing in dreams, is &s;o conclu&s;ive, I could not help reading it to my mother, who u&s;ed to be a great advocate for them; &s;he &s;eemed &s;truck with what you &s;aid, and, after a &s;hort &s;ilence, indeed Eliza, &s;ays &s;he, I never con&s;idered the matter in that light, and do not know that it can be confuted: but this I know, I never met with any young lady who has &s;o ju&s;t a way of thinking on every &s;ubject as Mi&s;s Mortimer; I am &s;ure, my dear, you will not be jealous that I do not except you, which with all my partiality I cannot; but your friend is four years, at lea&s;t, older than you, and has made &s;o good u&s;e of her time, that many women old enough to be her mother, might be improved by her con|ver&s;atio.</P>
<P>I will not tell you all &s;he &s;aid of you, becau&s;e I know it di&s;tre&s;&s;es you to hear your own prai&s;es; but you may believe, it gratified me very much.</P>

<P>ARE not you &s;urpri&s;ed at my long &s;ilence? to be &s;ure you are, as it is very un&s;ual with me to neglect writing to my dear Eliza for &s;o many days; but your wonder will cea&s;e when I tell you, I am ab&s;olutely out of breath with the hurry this wicked Count has put us all into. You have not the lea&s;t chance of being at the wedding, for the preparations are going on with unrea&s;onable &s;peed, and the &s;ettlements are actually very near fi|ni&s;hed, he has &s;o effectually quickened the clerks.</P>
<P>He got letters from France &s;oon after I wrote to you la&s;t, I believe the day or two after; he &s;ays him&s;elf, it was as &s;oon as an an&s;wer could po&s;&s;ibly arrive; and immediately he communicated them to Gertrude and me, reque&s;ting if we di&s;|approved of any part, I might &s;ay &s;o,
<PB N="208" REF="207">and it &s;hould be altered. There was, however, no objection to be made, every thing was done &s;o genteely by his fa|ther. When I &s;ignified my approbati|on, (for you mu&s;t know I am her guar|dian on this occa&s;ion) he told me, he &s;hould immediately give proper orders to an Attorney, and hoped I would u&s;e my influence with Mi&s;s St. George, to prevail on her not to make unnece&s;&s;ary delays, but fix an early day for his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I undertook the emba&s;&s;y, and gave it as my opinion, that &s;he &s;hould not take an unrea&s;onable time, as he is appoint|ed to a place at Court, and will return home as &s;oon as he conveniently can; for I believe he will be permitted to go on parole. She mentioned four or five weeks, and then &s;aid &s;ix or &s;even, upon which I left her, left &s;he &s;hould increa&s;e it to &s;o many months; and telling him what &s;he had &s;aid, he began to exclaim mo&s;t vehemently in French, again&s;t her determination; and begged me to re|member what a tedious time that would be to him, who had already &s;uffered &s;uch a long probation, by lo&s;ing her ju&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="208">at the time he had hoped to be united to her for ever.</P>
<P>I then told him, if he would leave it to me, I would endeavour to get her con&s;ent for the 10th of next month, which will be her birth-day, and &s;ooner than that, he could not expect. He &s;aid he would abide by my deci&s;ion, and after much per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he agreed to it, but in&s;i&s;ted it looked like being in too great a hurry.</P>
<P>This weighty point being &s;ettled, there is a thou&s;and little matters to be done, as we do not know how &s;oon af|ter the marriage they will &s;et out for France. The &s;ight of tho&s;e preparati|ons recalls to poor Harry's memory the time when he returned to Ireland, in full hope of being in that &s;ituation, and the idea, that all his pro&s;pects of happine&s;s in that way, are now &s;hut in, makes him &s;igh; and at times rai&s;es a momen|tary &s;adne&s;s in my heart; not that I cannot marry him, believe me, I have no regrets on that account, but becau&s;e I &s;ee the di&s;appointment continues to &s;it too heavily on him. The Count, whom I find, he has let into the &s;ecret, &s;aid to
<PB N="210" REF="209">me to-day, <Q REND="margQuotes">Ah! Mi&s;s Mortimer, my happine&s;s reminds poor Mr. Maun&s;ell of his di&s;appointment; can you give him no hope?</Q> I laid my hand upon his mouth; <Q REND="margQuotes">that is a prohibited &s;ubject, Count; the thing is impo&s;&s;ible; Mr. Maun&s;ell knows it is.</Q> He &s;hook his head, and with the &s;ofte&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of compa&s;&s;ion in his eyes, (you know how expre&s;&s;ive French eyes are) &s;aid, "'tis "pity, 'tis great pity!" I am &s;ure he makes Harry much wor&s;e than he would be, by pitying him, and indulging him in talking over the affair; for he was chear|ful and ea&s;y before.</P>
<P>You &s;ay it is cruel in me to let any one el&s;e attend me; you do not, however, con&s;ider, that though there may be no impropriety in his making a public &s;hew of his attachment to me, it would not be quite &s;o proper for me to do &s;o; which I &s;hould in effect, if I refu&s;ed the little offices of politene&s;s from any other man: and notwith&s;tanding you &s;ay, I have a propen&s;ity to flirting, you know me too well to think I could find any plea&s;ure in giving pain to a heart that doats on me: but you mu&s;t confe&s;s, we are in a very peculiar &s;ituation, and it
<PB N="211" REF="210">requires &s;ome degree of circum&s;pection to avoid the tongue of &s;lander.</P>
<P>Gertrude was not a bit di&s;plea&s;ed with me for leaving Harry to be her Gentle|man-U&s;her; for be&s;ides that, he is a great favourite with her, &s;he was well plea&s;ed not to be the object of the Count's attention in public.

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. Mi&s;s FITZGERALD, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Jan. 28. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK this la&s;t jaunt of mine to the country has produced nothing but di&s;agreeable events. In the fir&s;t place, it &s;eparated me from my Loui&s;a; then it deprived me of meeting Emily; of &s;ee|ing the Volunteers; gave occa&s;ion for Charles's jealou&s;y to break out; and to &s;um up all, the coldne&s;s of the place brought on my mother's illne&s;s, which will now detain me from Gertrude's wed|ding; and that, I acknowledge, is a very great mortification to me; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, I have no one plea&s;ing reflec|tion to make me amends for all my di&s;|appointments,
<PB N="213" REF="212">appointments, except that my mother continues tolerably, and I have hopes we &s;hall get to town in le&s;s than a month.</P>
<P>I never liked the Country in winter, and from this time, I believe I &s;hall hate the &s;ight of it.</P>
<P>My acquaintance with the Mi&s;s Boyle's is the only agreeable circum&s;tance that has occurred &s;ince I left Dublin: I fancy they will be in town before me, as the &s;ervants they left in the hou&s;e, tell our's, they expect their ma&s;ter &s;oon; and I know he was to come home when his daughters &s;et out for town. When I come, I will introduce them to you.</P>
<P>I have been trying the experiment you recommended to me, Loui&s;a, and it has &s;ucceeded to the utmo&s;t of your wi&s;hes. I am a&s;hamed of having ever been &s;o unthankful for the many ble&s;|&s;ings I enjoy; as to overlook them all, and make my&s;elf unhappy with the ap|prehen&s;ion of evils, that, perhaps, may never come to pa&s;s; and if they did,
<PB N="214" REF="213">would not be equal to half the mi&s;eries which I have &s;een one family patiently &s;uffering; but people bred up in ea&s;e and affluence, have no idea of what real misfortune is; and therefore lament as &s;uch, trifles that ought not to give a rea|&s;onable creature a moment's pain.</P>
<P>The day after I wrote to you la&s;t, I took Kitty with me in the chai&s;e, and went about three miles off, where &s;he told me there were &s;everal poor Cottagers on the e&s;tate of a young gentleman now on his travels; for thank Heaven, the lower cla&s;s of tenants on Charles's e&s;tate, or mine, are none of them in want. We had turned into a bye-road that led to a few &s;cattered cabbins, and were driving towards the neare&s;t, when I &s;ay a pretty girl, about nine years old, run out, and clapping her hands together, in an agony of grief, cried out, "Oh! my mammy! my mammy!" and with|out &s;eeming to hear the carriage, in a manner flew acro&s;s the road to a cottage at the other &s;ide, into which &s;he went. The child's exclamation rai&s;ed both my pity and curio&s;ity, as I gue&s;&s;ed it mu&s;t
<PB N="215" REF="214">be occa&s;ioned by &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s &s;he had left her mother in; and calling John to &s;top, I &s;tepped out, followed by Kitty, and went directly into the hou&s;e: but what a &s;cene of woe pre&s;ented it&s;elf! at one &s;ide of the room lay the corp&s;e of a man, on a bed; at the other, near the dying embers of a turf fire, lay the wo|man on a bed of &s;traw, in a fainting fit; an infant about three days old, &s;leeping at her &s;ide. With Kitty's a&s;&s;i&s;tance I rai&s;ed her, and applied my Eau de Luce to her no&s;e, which &s;oon revived her, and &s;he looked wildly round; when ca&s;t|ing her eyes on her dead hu&s;band, &s;he clapped her hands over them, as if una|ble to bear the &s;ight, and cried out, who was &s;o cruel as to bring me back to a life of mi&s;ery! I bid her be comforted, as I hoped &s;he and her children would yet be happy. The &s;trange voice &s;truck her ear, (for I believe &s;he never ob&s;erv|ed my appearance) and &s;he took down her hand to view me, ju&s;t as the little girl came in, followed by an old wo|man.</P>
<P>They all looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;eem|ed at a lo&s;s to account for what they
<PB N="216" REF="215">&s;aw; when I, who was &s;upporting the poor woman, and apprehen&s;ive &s;he would faint again, a&s;ked if they had any thing fit to give her? The old woman with tears in her eyes, an&s;wered, &s;he feared there was nothing but a little butter-milk, and a few potatoes, which the poor neighbours brought in. I then called for &s;ome water, and gave her a little, with Eau de Luce in it, which re|covered her from the fainti&s;hne&s;s; and tears flowing plentifully, &s;he was much relieved, and we laid her down again.</P>
<P>I &s;ent John to an Inn about half a mile off, for a bottle of Wine, and &s;ome other refre&s;hments; and while he was away, enquired of the old woman, how the people came into &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. She told me the man had been a Linen-Weaver, near Armagh; and lived very comfortably, till he fell into a lingering illne&s;s; which di&s;abled him from work|ing, and having nothing to &s;upport him but what his wife earned by &s;pinning, they were forced to &s;ell mo&s;t of their furniture, to pay their rent, and brought
<PB N="217" REF="216">the &s;mall remainder to the place they were now in, where they had been but a few months; they made a &s;hift to main|tain them&s;elves by the woman's indu&s;|try, and what little the child could do, till the man grew &s;o bad, his wife could do nothing but attend him, and they were reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, when to add to it, &s;he was brought to bed a few days ago; that &s;he &s;taid with them as much as &s;he could, and had not left them half an hour, when the child ran to tell her, her father was dead, and her mother dying; &s;he concluded with &s;aying, &s;he hope Heaven had &s;ent me that way for their relief.</P>
<P>John returned &s;ooner than I could have expected, and I gave the woman &s;ome warm Wine and Water, and gave directions for a Chicken he had brought to be made into broth for her, and the old woman undertook to &s;tay and do e|very thing that was proper, to whom I gave &s;ome money to provide &s;iring, and whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for that night: promi&s;ing to &s;end a &s;upply from our hou&s;e next day.</P>
<PB N="218" REF="217">
<P>You may be &s;ure I rewarded her for her trouble, in a manner that will &s;ecure her attendance while it is wanted; and as &s;oon as the woman is well enough, I intend to bring her to a neat little hou&s;e that is now unoccupied on my lands, where &s;he &s;hall be rent-free, till &s;he can, by her indu&s;try (for I do not wi&s;h to en|courage idlene&s;s) get a few guineas to lay by, and then I will let her have it at a very ea&s;y rent: the garden is now well cropped, &s;o that &s;he will have nothing to do but attend her &s;pinning for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>I am now convinced that the wi&s;e man's &s;aying, <Q REND="margQuotes">It is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourning,</Q> provided one makes a proper u&s;e of the le&s;&s;on it teaches; for tho&s;e poor people's di&s;tre&s;s has engro&s;&s;ed all my thoughts; and relieving them, given me more plea&s;ing reflections than ever I enjoyed before on doing a charitable action: becau&s;e till now, I never &s;aw the wretchedne&s;s from which I relieved the objects of my com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="219" REF="218">
<P>While I &s;tay in the country, I &s;hall often &s;tep into the little huts, and &s;ee what way the poor inhabitants are in, and in Dublin the news-papers frequently furni&s;h us with notice where to find the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: for the future I &s;hall always vi&s;it them my&s;elf; it will teach me to &s;et a proper value on the ble&s;&s;ings that are extended to me, and to bear light evils without repining.</P>
<P>I will not again pretend to blame you in regard to Mr. Maun&s;ell, for I acknow|lege you are uncommonly circum&s;tanc|ed; nor do I know a woman, except your&s;elf, that would act with &s;uch pro|priety in the &s;ame &s;ituation: but I can|not help pitying him. No doubt, the Count, who has &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, is quite affected with his melancholy tale.</P>
<P>I hope &s;oon to hear from Charles in London, for then his &s;tay in England will not be very much longer; perhaps we may reach Dublin nearly at the &s;ame time. Do you think James has made any declaration to Emily yet? I find
<PB N="220" REF="219">all our family look on it as a match very likely to take place: I hope it may.</P>

<P>What a bu&s;tle a wedding makes in a family; even the &s;ervants are anxious to have their finery ready on the occa&s;ion; and I a&s;&s;ure you, our maidens will make no &s;mall figure, as Gertrude in&s;i&s;ted on
<PB N="222" REF="221">bedizening them all at her own expence, not excepting Emily's dam&s;el, who by the way, is quite a Belle among&s;t her own cla&s;s, and I believe is much delight|ed at being permitted to throw off her mourning for that night, when I dare &s;ay, &s;he will appear in all her airs, for I &s;ee &s;he lays her&s;elf out for admirati|on.</P>

<PB N="223" REF="222">which they repeated with amazing volu|bility, all talking at once; and I dare &s;ay, have talked and thought of little el&s;e &s;ince: though we do not mean to make any great parade of it, there mu&s;t be a good many people, as it is a com|pliment &s;he cannot avoid paying &s;ome uncles, aunts, and cou&s;ins, that are now in town; I think it be&s;t &s;o, for I always ob&s;erve, the more company there is, the le&s;s notice is taken of the Bride, their attention being engaged by each other.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the affair was over for Ger|trude's &s;ake, who begins to look &s;erious as the day draws near; I am not &s;urpri&s;ed &s;he &s;hould, as it will make &s;uch a mate|rial in every circum&s;tance of her life; it is not only the change from a &s;ingle &s;tate, in which &s;he is intirely mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions, to one wherein &s;he mu&s;t accommodate her&s;elf to the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of another, but it will al&s;o re|move her from her country, and all her connexions, and place her among&s;t peo|ple who can have no other attachment to her, than what her own merit may en|title
<PB N="224" REF="223">her to. No wonder her reflections &s;hould be rather melancholy; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think &s;he &s;tands in need of all her affection for the Count, and a large &s;hare of philo&s;ophy be&s;ides, to enable her to &s;upport her &s;pirits. One thing is much in her favour, that is, &s;he is &s;o lit|tle alone, that &s;he has &s;carce any time for thinking. Was I in her place, it is my opinion I &s;hould have declared off, when I came to con&s;ider the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Harry expects to hear from Charles when he has &s;een a little of London; I am not &s;ure that I did not tell you that before.</P>
<P>I was a good deal affected for your poor family, and &s;hould have been quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed but that I knew, now you had met with them, they would be effectually relieved: I mu&s;t beg of you to give them five guineas, to make &s;ome little additi|on to their furniture and cloaths, and &s;et it down to my account, it would be too much for you to take it all upon your|&s;elf,
<PB N="225" REF="224">when you will meet with &s;o many others that want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I knew your vi&s;iting the afflicted would have the de&s;ired effect, becau&s;e you are alive to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of your fellow-crea|tures. You are not one of tho&s;e who fancy they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperfine feel|ings, yet never feel for any one but them|&s;elves, and are &s;o apprehen&s;ive of hurt|ing their &s;pirits, that their deare&s;t friends, if in &s;ickne&s;s or affliction, mu&s;t find &s;ome one of le&s;s feeling, and more humanity, to perform the tender offices of friend|&s;hip; for in this age of delicate nerves, the terms are by no means &s;ynonimous. I am &s;ure we know one or two ladies who are always talking of their fine feelings, and were never yet known to do a good-natured or charitable action.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your approba|tion, though at the expence of the re&s;t of the Sex; it is no reflection on them, however, for I believe a peculiarity of &s;entiment is nece&s;&s;ary to enable one to conduct them&s;elves in &s;uch a particular
<PB N="226" REF="225">&s;ituation as mine; and that cannot be ex|pected from many, nor do &s;uch circum|&s;tances often occur. Indeed there is very few to whom my example &s;hould be re|commended; for it would be a mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;tate to tho&s;e who have great &s;en|&s;ibility, and very little command of their pa&s;&s;ions, to keep up an intimate friend|&s;hip with a young man they like, and are effectually re&s;trained from marrying: the tryal would be too great for female forti|tude to &s;upport, if not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch a &s;ingularity of di&s;po&s;ition as I happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. If Harry's was &s;imilar, there would be no more debating on Platonic Love, as we &s;hould be proof po&s;itive of its exi&s;tence. As it is, I think the point mu&s;t remain undecided.</P>
<P>Yes, the Count deplores Harry's mi&s;|fortune in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, and Harry, in con&s;equence, is mighty &s;ad, and mighty &s;illy: I &s;hould be obliged to alter my conduct towards him, if I did not conclude that his friends departure, which is is not far off, will re&s;tore him to his under&s;tanding.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="226">
<P>What a detail you have given of the di&s;agreeable events produced by your go|ing to the country; they were not very plea&s;ing to be &s;ure, however, I look upon the accident which occa&s;ioned Charles's jealou&s;ly to break out, as rather fortunate than otherwi&s;e: had it been &s;mothered till after you were married, the con&s;e|quence would have been much wor&s;e, &s;ince you would have no remedy but parting, which will be much better done before marriage, if you &s;hould find him incurable, but I hope you will not.</P>
<P>No, I do not believe Mr. Fitzgerald and Emily have come to any explanation; but his behaviour cannot be mi&s;taken, &s;he is forced to acknowlege it cannot, and is grown more re&s;erved to him upon it, probably that deters him from &s;peaking; he fears to give her offence by entering on &s;uch a &s;ubject &s;o early in her widow|hood, as he mu&s;t &s;ee &s;he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoids giving him any opportunity. I am, how|ever, of opinion, it will come to &s;ome|thing in due time, for &s;he does not di&s;like him, and can have no other objection to
<PB N="228" REF="227">him, unle&s;s her father forbid the banns, on account of his fortune not being equal to her's; but I am in hopes he will allow his birth to make up for the deficiency, as I know he &s;ets &s;ome value on ancient gentility; a new title would not have half the weight with him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have thought of the ob|jection, only Mr. O'Neil is &s;o fond of mo|ney; otherwi&s;e I would &s;uppo&s;e he might think his fortune and her's together, quite &s;ufficient for happine&s;s, as his is not in|con&s;iderable, and her's very large, exclu|&s;ive of what is &s;ettled on the child. James is exceeding fond of the little thing, and I can tell you, that is no bad way of pay|ing his court to its grandfather, who is mighty fooli&s;h about the baby: it is a pretty creature too, and one cannot help taking notice of it.</P>
<P>My next will give you an account of the wedding; Gertrude wi&s;hes you could
<PB N="229" REF="228">be with her. Tea waits, while I tell you, I am, mo&s;t affectionately,</P>
