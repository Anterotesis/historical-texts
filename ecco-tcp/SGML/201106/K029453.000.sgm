<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE great and unde&s;erv|ed Honour you have been pleas'd to grant me, of laying the&s;e Pa|pers at the Feet of your ROYAL HIGHNESS, ju&s;tly demands
<PB REF="3">the mo&s;t thankful Acknowledgement: Ina&s;much, as it mu&s;t be a Means of pre&s;erving me from the Cen&s;ures, or Su&s;picions of tho&s;e, whom my own Character, little known in the World, may not &s;atisfy of the Impartiality and Regard to Truth, which I have ob&s;erv'd therein. For it will not &s;urely be imagin'd, that I &s;hould pre&s;ume to offer to &s;o Great, &s;o Good, and &s;o di&s;cerning a PRINCESS, any Account of a Matter of &s;o much Con&s;equence to Mankind, but what is in all Re&s;pects ju&s;t and true, to the be&s;t of my Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is, MADAM, by &s;uch an Ac|count, that the Practice of Inocu|lation mu&s;t &s;tand, or fall. If upon a fair and exact Balance of the
<PB REF="4">good and ill Succe&s;s of it, it appear in the main to be beneficial to Man|kind; it will in Time, in de&s;pite of Clamour and unrea&s;onable Oppo&s;i|tion, be reckon'd among the many Ble&s;&s;ings, for which the&s;e Nations, under the Divine Providence, are in|debted to the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of BRUNSWICK: And if it prove the contrary, I need not &s;ay, that nei|ther the Name and powerful Patro|nage of your ROYAL HIGHNESS, nor the happy Succe&s;s it has been attend|ed with on the growing Hopes of BRITAIN, will be able to protect it. For if this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;ame Noble and God-like Motive of doing Good, which has hitherto prompted you to countenance this Practice, will then no le&s;s powerfully induce you to

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF The Succe&s;s of Inocula|ting the SMALL POX in <HI>Great Britain, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Di&s;putes about the Pra|ctice of Inoculating the SMALL POX, like many of our other Differences, have been carry'd to &s;o great a Height, that it is difficult for any one to write upon this Subject, without being drawn into Con|trover&s;y, even tho' he delivers only Matter of Fact, or the undeniable Con&s;equences drawn from it, and that with the greate&s;t Impartia|lity, and the &s;tricte&s;t Regard to Truth.
<PB N="2" REF="7">Tho' &s;uch a Procedure, one would imagine, &s;hould &s;o far entitle the Writer to the good Nature and Protection of the World, as to &s;e|cure him from the Attacks of either Party; e&s;pecially as in acting thus, he cannot favour or prejudice either of them, any otherwi&s;e than as the Facts them&s;elves declare for, or again&s;t them. At lea&s;t, tho&s;e who contend only for Truth, ought never to be out of Humour with him, who indifferently furni&s;hes either Side with the proper Materials for the Support of their Opinion, or the Conviction of its being not to be maintain'd.</P>
<P>With this De&s;ign I laid before the World a little
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter to Dr.</HI> Cote&s;worth.</NOTE> Piece the la&s;t Year, and intend, God willing, to continue &s;o doing, from Year to Year, 'till the Practice of Inoculation &s;hall ei|ther be e&s;tabli&s;h'd on a firm and la&s;ting Foot, or &s;hall be ju&s;tly exploded; the Fate thereof being, as I conceive, only to be determin'd by Matter of Fact and Experience faithfully related.</P>
<P>In Order to be able to do which, I have u&s;ed my be&s;t Endeavours, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Friends, to procure the mo&s;t Authen|tick Accounts I was able; and I &s;hall be thankful to all Per&s;ons, who at any Time hereafter, will be plea&s;ed to &s;end me well atte&s;ted Relations of any Particulars relating to the Succe&s;s of this Practice, bad as well as good; all which, they may be a&s;&s;ured, &s;hall be ju&s;tly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>To impo&s;e upon the World in any Particu|lar, is di&s;ingenuous and ba&s;e; but to deceive them in an Affair &s;o nearly concerning the
<PB N="3" REF="8">Lives of Mankind, is a Wickedne&s;s worthy of the utmo&s;t Abhorrence and Dete&s;tation. I hope none, that know me, will think me capable of any Thing &s;o criminal; and as for others, I beg they will not too ea&s;ily give Credit to flying Reports, with which the World is too often amu&s;ed, without any ju&s;t Foundation; but that, in Ca&s;e of Doubt about any Thing which I &s;hall here deliver, they will be plea&s;ed to give them&s;elves the Trouble of peru&s;ing the Materials in my Hands, which I &s;hall carefully pre&s;erve, and be ready to &s;hew them for their Satisfaction, as Vouchers of my Fidelity.</P>
<P>This Controver&s;y, though drawn out into many Particulars, &s;eems principally to turn upon the two following Points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether the Di&s;temper given by Inocu|lation be an effectual Security to the Patient, again&s;t his having the Small Pox afterwards in the natural Way?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether the Hazard of Inoculation be con&s;iderably le&s;s than that of the natu|ral Small Pox?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If the&s;e two Points were effectually &s;ettled, there would, I &s;uppo&s;e, be an End of the Di&s;pute, at lea&s;t among Phy&s;icians. For, if either of them be fairly determin'd in the Negative, the Practice of Inoculation mu&s;t on all Hands be given up. And on the other Hand, if the Te&s;t of Experience &s;hould plainly
<PB N="4" REF="9">declare for the affirmative Side of both the&s;e Que&s;tions, I doubt not but that every Gen|tleman, who has the Honour to &s;erve his Country in the Capacity of a Phy&s;ician, will have Integrity and Humanity enough to de|clare him&s;elf hone&s;tly and openly in Favour of the Practice. At lea&s;t, he will con&s;ider, whether it will be for his Reputation, when his Friend and his Patient &s;hall put his Life, or the Lives of his Children, into his Hands, to amu&s;e him&s;elf with Theological Di&s;putes and Scruples, whether it be lawful to &s;ave them. For if the Practice of Inoculation be really found to be a Means of pre&s;erving Life, it will not be ea&s;y to make the World believe, that it is criminal to u&s;e it.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, therefore, of the&s;e Que&s;tions, though it will require a con&s;iderable Length of Time, and a much greater Number of Ex|periments than have yet been made, before it can be ab&s;olutely determin'd; yet thus much may at pre&s;ent be &s;aid, that our Expe|rience, as far as it goes, has hitherto &s;trongly favour'd the affirmative Side. For tho' many Trials have been purpo&s;ely made by Phy&s;i|cians and others, both upon Children and grown Per&s;ons, who have had the Small Pox by Inoculation, in cau&s;ing them not only to conver&s;e with, but to handle, to nur&s;e, and to lie in the &s;ame Bed with others &s;ick of the natural Small Pox; yet there is no In&s;tance, as far as I have been able to learn, of any one Per&s;on either in <HI>Turky, New-England,</HI> or here at Home, who has receiv'd the Small Pox by In|oculation, that has afterwards had it in the na|tural
<PB N="5" REF="10">Way. If any &s;uch Ca&s;e &s;hall hereafter come to my Knowledge, I &s;hall not fail to lay it faithfully before the World; tho' it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that a &s;ingle In&s;tance or two of this Kind, out of a very great Number of Per&s;ons inoculated, ought not in Rea&s;on to overthrow the Practice. For it cannot be expected, that a Per&s;on who receives the Small Pox by Ino|culation, &s;hould be &s;afer from having it again, than one that has undergone it in the natural Way; and we are not certain, that the Small Pox does never, tho' perhaps exceeding rare|ly, happen twice naturally to the &s;ame Per|&s;on. For my own Part, I have never known it: But my ingenious Friend, Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Ma&s;|&s;ey,</HI> Apothecary, whom I the rather name, becau&s;e he is known to be no Friend to Ino|culation, has a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he &s;aw the &s;ame Per&s;on twice undergo the natural Small Pox. This, however, undoubtedly happens very &s;eldom; but if it does happen in the natural Way, it may happen likewi&s;e after Inocula|tion; and con&s;equently, a Per&s;on who has receiv'd the Di&s;temper by this Means, mu&s;t content him&s;elf with no greater a Degree of Security, than if he had undergone it natu|rally.</P>
<P>But if the Per&s;on inoculated does not re|ceive the Di&s;temper in any Degree from that Operation, as &s;ometimes falls out; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e we have no Rea&s;on to be &s;urpriz'd, if he afterwards happen to be taken with it in the natural Way. Inoculation, like all other Applications in Phy&s;ick or Surgery, will not always produce the intended Effect.
<PB N="6" REF="11">And no Wonder. We know from a thou|&s;and In&s;tances, that of &s;everal Per&s;ons, equal|ly expo&s;ed to the &s;ame contagious Di&s;ea&s;e, Part &s;hall e&s;cape, and Part be infected; and the &s;ame Per&s;on, expo&s;ing him&s;elf in the &s;ame Manner, at different Times, to the &s;ame Danger, &s;hall e&s;cape at one Time, and be &s;eiz'd at another. The &s;ame has happen'd twice in the Ca&s;e of Inoculation: Two Chil|dren, who had been inoculated without any Manner of Effect, as is atte&s;ted, not only by the Phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Nettleton,</HI> but by the Cer|tificates of the Parents them&s;elves, were af|terwards &s;eiz'd with the Small Pox, when it raged epidemically where they were; they had it favourably, and recover'd. The Re|lation &s;ent up to me, with the Certificates, by Dr. <HI>Nettleton,</HI> was publi&s;h'd &s;ome Months ago in the <HI>Daily Journal,</HI> and is reprinted at the End of this Paper, the Originals being &s;till in my Hands. And the&s;e are all the Ca&s;es of this Kind that are come to my Know|ledge, except a like Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>De Grave</HI> the Surgeon's Daughter; an Account of which, under the Father's own Hand, has been pub|li&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>Maitland.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to come to &s;ome Determination of the &s;econd Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Hazard of Inoculation be con&s;iderably le&s;s than that of the natural Small Pox? It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t Place, to know what is the Proportion between the Numbers of tho&s;e that undergo the Small Pox in the natural Way, and tho&s;e that die of them. With this View,
<PB N="7" REF="12">I have prov'd in my Piece
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letter to Dr.</HI> Cote&s;worth.</NOTE> publi&s;h'd la&s;t Year, that at lea&s;t a fourteenth Part of Mankind die of the natural Small Pox; and I have, I think, render'd it probable, that, of Per|&s;ons of all Ages undergoing that Di&s;temper, there die at lea&s;t two in &s;eventeen. The&s;e Deductions are drawn from the Con&s;ideration of the Bills of Mortality for 42 Years pa&s;t: And from an actual Account of a great Num|ber of Per&s;ons that underwent that Di&s;ea&s;e, as taken in &s;everal Places, by a careful En|quiry from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, I have there &s;hown, that there died one in between five or &s;ix, or about two in eleven. I &s;hall now re|peat that Account with &s;everal others, which have &s;ince been communicated to me by Per|&s;ons of Credit, in the following Table.</P>

<P>The Re&s;ult is, that as far as the&s;e Accounts can inform us, there dies nearly one out of &s;ix Per&s;ons &s;ick of the Small Pox in the na|tural Way, or (more accurately) five out of thirty one: Which Proportion we mu&s;t con|tent our &s;elves with for the pre&s;ent; 'till by obtaining Accounts from more Places, we may by the Largene&s;s of the Numbers, come near|er to the true Proportion.</P>
<P>Such therefore being the Hazard of dying of the Small Pox in the natural Way; we come now to con&s;ider what is the Hazard of dying of the Inoculated Small Pox; in Order to which, we offer the following Li&s;ts of Per|&s;ons inoculated; which we hope may be de|pended

<PB N="12" REF="17">
<P>The &s;econd Table contains the Number of Per&s;ons of every &s;everal Age there expre&s;s'd, that were inoculated, with the Effect of the Operation</P>
<P>In Order to make which the better under|&s;tood, as well as for the Information of tho&s;e Readers, who may have Occa&s;ion to make U&s;e of this Practice, I &s;hall here give &s;ome Account of what is to be done, and what is u&s;ually ob&s;erv'd in Inoculation, as I have extracted it from a careful Examination and Compari&s;on of the &s;everal Relations tran&s;|mitted to me, with Regard, 1&s;t, To the Sub|ject to be inoculated: 2d, The Preparation: 3d, The Choice of the infectious Matter: 4th, The Operation: 5th, The Sickening, or the Symptons preceding the Eruption: 6th, The Eruption: 7th, The Running of the Inci&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Great Care ought to be taken to inocu|late none but Per&s;ons of a good Habit of Body, and free, not only from any appa|rent, but, as far as can be judg'd, from any latent Di&s;ea&s;e; for which Rea&s;on, every prudent Per&s;on will, in this Ca&s;e, have the Advice and Opinion of his own Phy&s;ician, whether the Subject to be inoculated, be in a fit Condition to undergo the &s;mall Pox; that &s;o he may not have that Di&s;temper, and a bad Con&s;titution, or perhaps another Di|&s;ea&s;e, to &s;truggle with at the &s;ame Time; of which there have been &s;everal fatal In&s;tances, thro' the Neglect of this Caution. In &s;ome Ca&s;es indeed it has fallen out, that the Per&s;on inoculated, has by this Means got free of an|other Di&s;ea&s;e, under which he labour'd be|fore;
<PB N="13" REF="18">as &s;ometimes happens likewi&s;e in the natural Way, though the contrary is much more frequent.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Body, e&s;pecially if Plethorick, ought to be prepared by proper Evacuations, as bleeding, purging, vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' in many Ca&s;es there will be Occa&s;ion for very little or none of the&s;e, it being &s;ufficient to enjoyn a temperate Diet, and proper Regi|men: But this mu&s;t be left to the Judgment of the Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P N="3">3. The utmo&s;t Caution ought to be u&s;ed in the Choice of proper Matter to communicate the Infection. It &s;hould be taken from a young Subject, otherwi&s;e perfectly &s;ound and healthful, who has the Small Pox in the mo&s;t favourable Manner. When the Pu&s;tules are perfectly, maturated, and ju&s;t upon the Turn, or &s;oon after, two or three of them &s;hould be ripp'd with a Glover's Needle, or &s;mall Lancet, and a couple of &s;mall Pledgets of Lint, or Cotton, are to be well moi&s;tned with the Matter, and immediately put into a little Vial, or Box, and carry'd in the warm Hand, or Bo&s;om of the Operator, to the Hou&s;e of the Per&s;on to be inoculated.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Inci&s;ions are u&s;ually made with a &s;mall Lancet in the brawny Part of both Arms, or in one Arm and the oppo&s;ite Leg, cutting ju&s;t into, or at mo&s;t thro' the Cutis, or true Skin, for the Length of a Quarter of an Inch, half an Inch, or at mo&s;t an Inch. This being done, one of the Pledgets moi&s;tned with the infectious Matter, is to be laid upon each Inci&s;ion, and to be kept on by Means of
<PB N="14" REF="19">a Bit of &s;ticking Plai&s;ter laid over it, for about four and twenty Hours; after which, all may be taken off, and the Inci&s;ions dre&s;t with common <HI>Diachylon,</HI> or with only warm Cabbage or Colewort Leaves, once a Day at fir&s;t; and afterwards, when the Di&s;charge is con&s;iderable, twice a Day 'till they heal; or only with a Linnen Roller, to defend them from the Air.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Per&s;on inoculated, &s;ometimes re|ceives the Small Pox without any previous Sickne&s;s, as often happens in the mo&s;t favou|rable Sort in the natural Way. But the great|er Part begin to be a little feveri&s;h, and have more or le&s;s of the u&s;ual Symptoms preceding the natural Small Pox, mo&s;t commonly upon the eighth Day from Inoculation, tho' pretty often upon the &s;eventh, and very rarely a Day or two &s;ooner or later.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Patients are &s;ometimes taken with flu&s;hing Heats, which di&s;appear again in a lit|tle Time, about the 4th or 5th Day; but the Eruption of the Pu&s;tules happens generally within a Day, or &s;ometimes two or three, after the &s;ickening, <HI>viz.</HI> mo&s;t commonly on the ninth Day, le&s;s frequently on the 10th, and &s;till le&s;s on the 8th or 11th; in a few Ca&s;es it has appear'd on the 7th or 12th, in one Ca&s;e on the 18th, in one on the 24th, in one on the 6th, and in another on the 3d. The la&s;t Patient but one had the confluent Sort, and dy'd: The la&s;t was very full of the di&s;tinct Kind, and recover'd.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Inci&s;ions begin to grow &s;ore and painful about the 4th or 5th Day, and about
<PB N="15" REF="20">the 6th, 7th, or 8th, they begin to dige&s;t, and run with a thick purulent Matter, which gradually encrea&s;es 'till about the Turn of the Di&s;temper, during which Time the Wounds grow wide and deep; afterwards the Running gradually abates, and they u&s;ually heal up in about a Month, &s;ometimes in three Weeks, though in &s;ome they continue running five or &s;ix Weeks, or &s;omething lon|ger. The greater the Di&s;charge is by the In|ci&s;ions, the more favourable the Di&s;temper is found in other Re&s;pects. When the Ino|culation does not take Effect, the Inci&s;ions heal up in a few Days, like a common Cut. Where Children happen to have I&s;&s;ues before Inoculation, they begin in a few Days to run in a much greater Quantity than u&s;ual, and continue &s;o doing, in the &s;ame Manner as the Inci&s;ions, during the State of the Di|&s;temper, after which, they return to their ordinary Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In this Table, by having an imperfect Small Pox, is meant, the having &s;ome &s;ligh|ter Eruption, of but a few Days continuance, but this attended with an Inflammation and Running of the Inci&s;ions for the u&s;ual Time, and generally preceded by &s;ome of the com|mon Symptoms of the Small Pox; this be|ing e&s;teem'd, by the Accounts from <HI>Turkey,</HI> and our own Experience at Home, as far as it goes, to be an effectual Security again&s;t ha|ving the Small Pox afterwards in the natural Way.</P>
<P>Under the Article of <HI>No Effect,</HI> are com|prehended, not only all tho&s;e Per&s;ons upon
<PB N="16" REF="21">whom the Operation produced no Effect of any Kind, but al&s;o tho&s;e upon whom the E|ruption was &s;o &s;light, and the Running of the Inci&s;ions &s;o little in Quantity, or of &s;o &s;hort a Duration, as to render it ju&s;tly doubt|ful whether it would amount to a Security, or no. Two of the&s;e were known to have had the Small Pox before, and were inocula|ted only for Experiment Sake, and &s;everal of the re&s;t underwent the Operation upon a Doubt whether they had had the Small Pox before or no, the Di&s;temper which they had un|dergone in the natural Way, having been &s;o &s;light and &s;o favourable, as to make their Pa|rents, them&s;elves, or their Phy&s;icians, to &s;u&s;pect that it was not the true Small Pox. But there were &s;ome, upon whom Inocula|tion did not produce the Di&s;temper, tho' there was no Su&s;picion of their having had it be|fore.</P>
<P>Under the Head of dying after Inocula|tion is compriz'd every Per&s;on, as far as I have been been able to learn, that has either by the Friends, or Adver&s;aries, to this Pra|ctice, been &s;u&s;pected to have dy'd of Inocula|tion.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>From this Table it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. That of 474 Per&s;ons inoculated, 440 have receiv'd the Small Pox from that Opera|tion; to which if it be thought proper to add the five, who had an imperfect Small Pox by Inoculation, the whole Number will be 445.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Operation has of ner fail'd of taking Effect upon tho&s;e of more advanc'd Ages, than upon young Children, as was naturally to be expected from the Rea&s;ons mention'd above; it being more likely that Per&s;ons of &s;uch Ages have had the Small Pox before, than Children.</P>
<P N="3">3. That however more favourable the na|tural Small Pox generally is to Children than grown Per&s;ons, yet Inoculation has been at|tended
<PB N="18" REF="23">with better Succe&s;s in the latter than in the former; and in particular, that out of 50 or 53 Per&s;ons of 20 Years of Age and upwards, that have had the Small Pox by Inoculation, not one has mi&s;carry'd.</P>
<P N="4">4. That 9 is the Number of Per&s;ons, who have been &s;u&s;pected to have died of Inocula|tion; &s;o that, if this Operation was really the Cau&s;e of all their Deaths, the Hazard of dying of the inoculated Small Pox mu&s;t be that of 9 in 440, or 445, that is, of one in 49, or 50.</P>
<P>But the curious Reader will doubtle&s;s ex|pect, that I &s;hould give him &s;ome farther In|formation, in Order to enable him to judge, whether, or no, all the&s;e Per&s;ons really died of Inoculation. This I &s;hall endeavour to do with all the Fidelity, that a Ca&s;e of &s;o much Importance requires, and with &s;uch Im|partiality, as to give no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence to either of the contending Parties. With this View I &s;hall here &s;et down the Name of every Per&s;on, that has been &s;u&s;pected by the one Side to have died of Inoculation; and on the other Hand, I &s;hall communicate the Accounts of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, as they have been tran&s;mitted to me by the Gentlemen con|cern'd in inoculating tho&s;e Per&s;ons, &s;ubjoin|ing every one's Name to his own Account.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is the Ca&s;e of the Honourable Mr. <HI>William Spencer,</HI> aged about three Years, who was inoculated in Town, <HI>April</HI> 2d, 1722, and died on the 21&s;t of the &s;ame Month. The Eruption appear'd on the 9th Day; he had a fair and full Eruption of Pu&s;tules of
<PB N="19" REF="24">different Sorts, ob&s;erving the common Periods and Symptoms of Inoculation; and after the greate&s;t Part of the Pu&s;tules were dry'd off, he was &s;eiz'd, on a &s;udden, on the 21&s;t Day, of a convul&s;ive Fit, of which he died. The Occa&s;ion of his Death may be farther enquir'd into, from the printed Account. Mr. <HI>Maitland. Vid. Maitland</HI>'s An&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Wagg|&s;taffe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Mi&s;s <HI>Rigby,</HI> aged a Year and &s;ix Months, was inoculated in <HI>London, April</HI> 29, 1722. She had a fair Eruption of Pu&s;tules, appearing on the eighth Day, and a much more favoura|ble Di&s;ea&s;e than her Si&s;ter, who recover'd: But one of her Arms &s;well'd and impo&s;thuma|ted, (as is u&s;ual &s;ometimes in the natural Small Pox) and whether it was by that, or breeding her Teeth (for &s;he cut &s;ome Teeth about that Time) is uncertain; however &s;he continu'd &s;ickly, feveri&s;h and hectick, and died about 8 Weeks after the Inoculation. <HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> declin'd the inoculating her with her Si&s;ter; but the Father having had a fa|vourable Account of this Practice from the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchants, would have it done; and there was another unlucky Circum&s;tance in this Affair; Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> was &s;eiz'd with a violent Fever for the Space of three Weeks, from the Day &s;he was inoculated, which, he thinks, might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure have occa|&s;ion'd the Sorene&s;s of her Arm, no &s;uch Thing having happen'd where he has been able to attend. Mr. <HI>Maitland.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Lord <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI>'s Servant, aged 19, was inoculated in <HI>London, April</HI> 30, 1722. He
<PB N="20" REF="25">was lately come from the Country into my Lord's Hou&s;e, where five of his Lord&s;hip's Children were then &s;ick of the Small Pox: He was ill for &s;ome few Days before he was inoculated, and his Complaints were &s;uch, that 'twas apprehended 'twould be the Small Pox. Therefore he was remov'd to a Nur&s;e's in <HI>Swallow-Street, Piccadilly,</HI> who provides for Per&s;ons in that Way. By Mr. <HI>Mead</HI>'s Di|rections he was blooded, and vomited, and took &s;everal cordial Powders; whereby being re&s;tor'd to Health it was thought proper to inoculate him. The Small Pox appear'd on him the 9th Day after Inoculation, of the favourable di&s;tinct Kind, whereby his Com|plaints were allay'd; but returning the next Day with bilious Vomitings frequent Stools, and a <HI>Delirium,</HI> a great many of the fluxed Kind then appear'd. The&s;e continu'd more or le&s;s upon him, notwith&s;tanding all the Medicines which Dr. <HI>Arbutbnot,</HI> and after|wards Dr. <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> in Conjunction wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h him did pre&s;cribe. He died on the 7th Day from the Eruption. His Lungs were found inflam'd and mortify'd. Serjeant <HI>Amyand.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Mi&s;s <HI>Rolt,</HI> aged between 9 and 10 Years, was inoculated in <HI>London,</HI> together with a Child of between 2 and 3 Years of Age, both with the &s;ame Matter, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25, 1723. Then both began to &s;icken on the eighth Day from Inoculation, and on the 10th the Small Pox appear'd on both of the di&s;tinct Kind. The Boy recover'd. Mi&s;s <HI>Rolt,</HI> the Day before the Eruption, complain'd of great Pains in her Shoulders, Elbows and Knees,
<PB N="21" REF="26">and the Fever continuing, the Small Pox flux|ed upon her the 3d Day from the Eruption. Sir <HI>Hans Sloane</HI> and Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot</HI> attended her. She went thro' the Di&s;temper with Ea&s;e; the Small Pox began to turn on her the 7th Day; but 'twas not dry'd all over 'till the 14th. The Fever, that aro&s;e then, occa|&s;ion'd her being blooded, and &s;oon after &s;everal Tumours appear'd in the Neighbour|hood of &s;everal Joints, which were open'd. The Fever &s;till continu'd, and more &s;uppu|rated Tumours were daily appearing, which were di&s;charg'd as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Some|times &s;he was troubled with a <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> whereby, as well as by the Suppuration of 20 or 30 Boils that were open'd, &s;he was &s;pent, &s;o that &s;he dy'd the 27th of <HI>November</HI> following, that is 9 Weeks after the Inocu|lation. Her Inci&s;ions continu'd running to the la&s;t. By all Accounts, &s;he had a bad Habit of Body; &s;he &s;truggled with the Jaun|dice the Year before, during &s;ix Months; it &s;hew'd its Head again in the Spring, but was &s;oon conquer'd; and as I have been inform'd of late, &s;he recover'd of the Mea&s;les but 10 Weeks before &s;he was inoculated. Had I been inform'd of this before, as well as of her ir|regular Life, no Ways &s;uited to one of her Years, I would hardly have adventur'd the Inoculation on her; tho' all that Time, &s;he &s;eem'd to me in a perfect State of Health, and perfectly recover'd of the Mea&s;les, which &s;he had had in the mo&s;t favourable Manner: Serjeant <HI>Amyand.</HI></P>
<PB N="22" REF="27">
<P N="5">5. Mi&s;s <HI>Brook&s;bank,</HI> aged 15 Months, was inoculated at <HI>Ealand</HI> near <HI>Halifax,</HI> in <HI>June</HI> 1723. She dy'd &s;uddenly on the 11th Day from the Eruption. <HI>Vid.</HI> Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s, and the Parent's Account at the End of this Paper.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mi&s;s <HI>Betty a Court</HI> 4 Years of Age, in|oculated at <HI>Ivy-Church</HI> near <HI>Sali&s;bury, Sept.</HI> 20, 1723.</P>
<P>She may very well be &s;aid to be born an infirm Child, for it is notoriou&s;ly known, that her Mother was &s;o ill almo&s;t all the Time of going with her, that her Midwife often de&s;pair'd of her Life, as believing &s;he would not go out her Time. The Child, two or three Months after &s;he was born, was &s;eiz'd with an <HI>Ophthalmia</HI> in both Eyes, and after that &s;he had a Humour to a great Degree, which broke out under her Chin, her Throat being very raw from Ear to Ear, which by purging, cutting an I&s;&s;ue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> went off. But &s;till at Spring and Fall &s;he was &s;ubject to the&s;e Humours, but to a le&s;s De|gree than at fir&s;t. Her I&s;&s;ue by the Negli|gence of the Nur&s;e, was dry'd up &s;ome con|&s;iderable Time before the Child was inocu|lated, as Mr. <HI>a Court</HI> him&s;elf told me; and that the Child had &s;omething of the&s;e Hu|mours broke out upon her, not above 3 Weeks before the Operation was perform'd, I was a&s;&s;ur'd by the Servants in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was inoculated with her four Bro|thers and a Servant Maid, all with the &s;ame Matter, from a Boy about 8 or 9 Years old, that had a kind Sort. I heard nothing of any of their Complaints 'till the eighth Day,
<PB N="23" REF="28">and then one had a Pain in his Head, ano|ther in his Back, one was taken with a Shi|vering, another with a Vomiting, and in &s;hort every one of them had &s;omething or other of the Symptoms of the Small Pox, except the Maid Servant. Mi&s;s's Complaint was chiefly in her Head and Back; the next Day, after the Symptoms came on, &s;he was flu&s;h'd in her Face rather like an <HI>Ery&s;ipelas</HI> than the Small Pox, and in 24 Hours after that the Pu&s;tules appear'd very thick in her Face, her right Arm and right Thigh, and &s;eem'd to come on pretty well. They were as full on her Brea&s;t, the <HI>Abdomen</HI> and In&s;ide of the Thighs; yet they continu'd always flat and langui&s;hing, without coming to Ma|turity, notwith&s;tanding all the Doctor could do to rai&s;e them. The Fever encreas'd on her every Day, and &s;he grew more and more re&s;tle&s;s, tho' her Inci&s;ions di&s;charg'd after a wonderful Manner. For all round each Arm, from her Shoulders to her Elbows, they ran like large Bli&s;ters, being as thick of Pu&s;tules as they could &s;tand under the Dre&s;&s;ings, which gave us &s;ome faint Hopes &s;he might get over it, 'till a Day or two before &s;he died. The Pu&s;tules on her Face, her right Arm and Thigh, turn'd the 7th and 8th Day; but then the &s;econd Fever came on, and it getting Ground every Day, &s;he continu'd in a languid State, and grew weaker and weaker, 'till &s;he expir'd, which was the 22d Day from the Inci&s;ions. Mr. <HI>Goldwyer.</HI></P>
<P>A Daughter of Mr. <HI>a Court</HI>'s, 4 Years of Age, was inoculated under a very ill Habit
<PB N="24" REF="29" MS="y">of Body, and &s;ubject to inflammatory cuta|neous Eruptions from its Birth. Per&s;ecuted always by a hectick Heat, the Child was thin and weak, too weak, indeed, to with&s;tand the Malignity of the confluent Kind &s;he la|bour'd under. But the four Sons inoculated at the &s;ame Time, with Matter taken from the &s;ame Per&s;on, had Di&s;ea&s;es of the di&s;tinct Kind, and are recover'd, though not the mo&s;t proper Per&s;ons for this Operation. Dr. <HI>Hele,</HI> Phy&s;ician in <HI>Sali&s;bury.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> E&s;q; 17 Years of Age, was inoculated at <HI>Earlbam</HI> near <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wich,</HI> with his Si&s;ter, <HI>Sept.</HI> 11th, 1723. The In|ci&s;ions did not inflame, but healed in about 10 Days, like a common Cut: No Fever, nor any Sort of Eruption follow'd; he was kept in breathing Sweats in Bed the 9th and 10th Day; a Day or two after he was purged, and &s;o a 2d, and a 3d Time.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> a &s;econd Attempt was made with Matter taken from his Si&s;ter; the Succe&s;s was the &s;ame; he was purged again as before, and releas'd from his Con|finement. During this whole Proceeding, he &s;lept very well, had a very good Appetite, and made not the lea&s;t Complaint, 'till up|on taking the Air in a very &s;harp Day, to|wards the latter End of <HI>October,</HI> he grew feveri&s;h that Night, with Pains in his Head and Limbs; his Pul&s;e was &s;trong, his Urine high colour'd, with a good Sediment; he was not very hot, nor thir&s;ty, but inclinable to &s;weat; the greate&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s he felt, was from a decay'd Tooth, which he was forc'd
<PB N="25" REF="30">to have drawn. This Di&s;order went off in 3 Days by natural Sweats: All that was given him, was 3 or 4 Papers of <HI>Pulv. e Chel. Cancr. comp.</HI> with <HI>Ca&s;tor, &amp;c.</HI> he being &s;ometimes a lit|tle low &s;pirited. A Faintne&s;s remain'd up|on him, four or five Days after the Fever went off, with want of Appetite: But upon taking a little Rhubarb once or twice, he &s;oon recover'd his Stomach, and &s;eem'd per|fectly well, when he return'd to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> about the Middle of <HI>November.</HI> The only Difference I ob&s;erv'd in him, was, that he was paler than u&s;ual, which I imputed to a long tedious Confinement and a &s;pare Diet, together with &s;ome little Anxiety from the Di&s;appointment he had met with. What happen'd at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to, leaving that Part to the Phy&s;ician that at|tended him; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that this young Gentleman has been very &s;ubject to Fevers, attended with nervous Symptoms; and that a Per&s;on nearly related to him, who &s;aw him in both Ca&s;es, told me, that this la&s;t Illne&s;s differ'd in nothing, except in the Violence of the Symptoms, from a Fe|ver he was &s;eiz'd with about three Years ago. Dr. <HI>Offley.</HI></P>
<P>This young Gentleman was taken ill of a nervous Fever, &s;uch as he had been ill of &s;everal Times before, about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> la&s;t, and dy'd on the 5th of <HI>Jannary.</HI> No Spot, nor Eruption of any Kind appear'd upon him; but a little before his Death, a great Quan|tity of Blood and Matter gu&s;h'd out at his
<PB N="26" REF="31">No&s;trils. Mrs <HI>Bacon,</HI> Mr. <HI>Profe&s;&s;or Green,</HI> Dr. <HI>A&s;henhur&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Mary Waller,</HI> five Years and a half old, was inoculated near <HI>Go&s;port, Oct.</HI> 18, 1723; together with two other Children, all with the &s;ame Matter. The other two &s;icken'd on the 7th Day, the Small Pox appear'd on the 9th, and they did very well: But this Child &s;icken'd at the Completion of the 4th Day, and the Eruption appear'd on the &s;ixth. She had the confluent Kind all over her, with many Purples, and died on the 18th Day after &s;he was inoculated. From the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>pag.</HI> 14.</NOTE> Ear|line&s;s of her Sickening, and the Eruption, it is not improbable, that &s;he had taken the Infection the ordinary Way before. This Opinion is farther &s;trengthen'd by the fol|lowing Circum&s;tance. A Maid was violent|ly &s;eiz'd with the Small Pox in the common Way, a little before the Operation, and con|tinu'd there two Days in a narrow Room, her Breath &s;melling &s;trong of the Infection, and the Child was &s;ometimes with her. To what is &s;aid, may be added, that the Child was leprous. Mr. <HI>Waller.</HI></P>

<P>From the Facts here laid down, I am &s;en|&s;ible the Inoculators will rai&s;e &s;everal Ob|jections again&s;t the E&s;timate of the Hazard of Inoculation, which I have given above, and to do them Ju&s;tice, I am obliged to lay
<PB N="27" REF="32">what are, or may be their Arguments, be|fore the World.</P>
<P N="1">1. They will maintain that the 4th, 6th, and 8th Ca&s;es ought to be left out of the Computation, becau&s;e the Patients were un|healthy Subjects, and therefore no Argument can be drawn from their dying, to increa&s;e the Hazard of tho&s;e who &s;hall be inocula|ted in perfect Health, pur&s;uant to the Cau|tion above given; and con&s;equently, that the Hazard to heathful Per&s;ons, can at mo&s;t be reckon'd to be no more than that of &s;ix in 440, or 445, that is of one in 73, or 74.</P>
<P N="2">2. They may object, that the &s;eventh Ca&s;e is intirely out of the Que&s;tion, the Per&s;on hav|ing been well &s;o long after the Operation, and in his la&s;t Illne&s;s, which happen'd near three Months after the &s;econd Inoculation, having had no Manner of Appearance of the Small Pox, nor any other Symptons, (as ap|pears by the Acknowledgement of his near|e&s;t Relations and others,) but what he had had more than once in former Fevers; ex|cept only the Eruption of Blood and Matter from his No&s;trils, a little before his Death; which often happening in other Ca&s;es, &s;eems not to be ju&s;tly chargeable upon Inoculation, e&s;pecially at &s;o great a Di&s;tance of Time from that Operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. They may ju&s;tly plead, that in a Com|pari&s;on between the Hazard of the natural and inoculated Small Pox, either only &s;uch, as die in the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, ought to be &s;et down on both Sides; or that, if in the Ca&s;e of Inoculation, I will charge the
<PB N="28" REF="33">Con&s;equences of the Operation, in occa&s;ion|ing other Di&s;ea&s;es, of which, the Patients happen to die after the Small Pox are en|tirely gone off, that I ought to do the &s;ame in the Ca&s;e of the natural Small Pox, it being notorious, that this Di&s;temper frequent|ly occa&s;ions other Di&s;ea&s;es, of which the Patients die a con&s;iderable Time after: And if I cannot do this in the natural Way, be|cau&s;e the Death of the Patient is, in this Ca&s;e, &s;et down in the weekly Bills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the other apparent Di&s;ea&s;e, then I ought to omit all &s;uch Ca&s;es in the Way of Inocula|tion, and con&s;equently the 2d, as likewi&s;e, the 4th and 7th for this Rea&s;on, be&s;ides the others before given, ought to be left out of the E&s;timate.</P>
<P N="4">4. They may likewi&s;e object to the 1&s;t, 3d, and 5th In&s;tances, from the Circum&s;tan|ces mention'd in the Account of tho&s;e Ca&s;es, and con&s;equently will not allow of more than one Ca&s;e, where the Patient can be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have died of Inoculation: And per|haps even that will be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e &s;everal Objections are of Weight, is &s;ubmited to the Determination of tho&s;e, who mu&s;t and will judge for them|&s;elves, that is, to every intelligent Reader, who being thus appriz'd of the Facts, may ea&s;ily, by &s;triking off &s;uch of the In&s;tances given above, as he thinks rea&s;onable, form to him&s;elf a Judgment of the Hazard of Life in this Operation: And to &s;uch therefore I leave it But to &s;ave him &s;ome little Trou|ble, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if upon the
<PB N="29" REF="34">Rea&s;ons here mention'd, he &s;ees Cau&s;e to ex|cept one Per&s;on out of the Number of tho&s;e that are &s;u&s;pected to have died of Inocula|tion, the Hazard mu&s;t then be e&s;timated to be that of one in 55, or 56.</P>

<P>It may perhaps be expected from me by &s;ome Per&s;ons, that in giving Account of the Mi&s;carriages of Inoculation, I &s;hould not con|fine my &s;elf barely to Lo&s;s of Life; but that I &s;hould likewi&s;e relate all the le&s;&s;er Acci|dents, as the breaking out of Boils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have follow'd upon that Practice, where the Patient has e&s;cap'd with his Life. But to &s;uch I mu&s;t reply, that in a De&s;ign to make a Compari&s;on between the Hazard of the Di|&s;temper in the natural Way, and when given by Inoculation, it would be improper and u&s;ele&s;s to in&s;ert &s;uch an Account, if it could be obtain'd, on the one Side, unle&s;s it were done likewi&s;e on the other. And every Phy&s;i|cian knows, that &s;uch like Accidents frequent|ly happen upon having the natural Small Pox, which it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible to make a perfect Collection of, and as im|practicable to &s;et that Collection in &s;uch a
<PB N="30" REF="35">Light, as would be requi&s;ite, in Order to make a Compari&s;on between it and the Accidents owing to Inoculation. For this Rea&s;on, I limit my Compari&s;on to the Hazard of Life it&s;elf, and &s;ee no Rea&s;on to doubt, but that &s;uch Way of having the Di&s;ea&s;e as le&s;s en|dangers Life, mu&s;t be likewi&s;e more favour|able in all other Particulars. This is affirm'd by the Practi&s;ers of Inoculation, and their Adver&s;aries, I think, do not offer to deny it.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, it may not be impro|per, to take &s;ome little Notice of an Article lately in&s;erted in one of our publick Papers. that in the Year 1722, there died of the Small Pox, within the Bills of Mortality, 2167 Per|&s;ons, and that in the Year 1723, <HI>the Year of Inoculation,</HI> there died 3271, exceeding the former Number by 1104.</P>
<P>With what View this was publi&s;h'd, is be&s;t known to the Authors of that, and &s;ome other &s;uch like Articles: But the U&s;e that I have heard made of it in Conver&s;ation, is, that in|oculating the Small Pox, contributed very much to the &s;preading of the Di&s;temper, and con&s;equently to the great Increa&s;e of the Mortality above-mention'd.</P>
<P>To obviate, which, I mu&s;t take Notice in the fir&s;t Place, that by the Accounts now lying before me, it appears, that in the Year 1722, there were 63 Per&s;ons inoculated with|in the Bills of Mortality, and in the Year 1723, which this Writer calls <HI>the Year of Inoculation.</HI> the Number inoculated was 68, ju&s;t five more than the Year before.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="36">
<P N="2">2. That as there died of the natural Pox, 3271 Per&s;ons in the Year 1723, the whole Number &s;ick of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e that Year, mu&s;t have been, by the Proportion laid down before, of &s;ix and &s;omething more to one, about 20000 Per&s;ons, and con&s;equently the &s;preading of the Di&s;temper by Means of Ino|culation, could bear no greater a Proportion to the natural Propagation of it, than that of 68 to 20000, or of one to 300. For it will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be pretended, that the Small Pox given by Inoculation, is more infectious than the natural Sort. I believe every Per|&s;on, who has been acquainted with both, will think it le&s;s &s;o, in Proportion, as it is more favourable.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if I have not already taken up more of the Reader's Time upon this Head, than the Thing is worth, I would de&s;ire him to ca&s;t his Eye upon the following Account of the Mortality of the Small Pox, for &s;everal Years before Inoculation was introduc'd among us, in &s;ome of which, he will find it greater, and in others, nearly equalito the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Out of every thou&s;and Per&s;ons that were bury'd, there died of the Small Pox,</P>

<P>The Con&s;ideration of the Bills of Mortali|ty puts into my Head another Remark, which I mu&s;t beg leave to make.</P>
<P>For the&s;e ten Years la&s;t pa&s;t, there have died of the Small Pox, within the Bills of Mortality, at a <HI>Medium,</HI> 2287 Souls <HI>per Annum.</HI> Let us now con&s;ider a little, what may be the Con&s;e|quence, in Ca&s;e Inoculation &s;hould hereafter become a general Practice. If we allow all the Oppo&s;ers of Inoculation contend for, we &s;hall find but one in 49 to die of Inoculation, and in the natural Way, we have &s;hown it to be one in &s;ix: It follows, that if we &s;ub&s;ti|tute Inoculation for the natural Way, the Number of the Dead would be reduc'd &s;even Parts in eight, and con&s;equently 2000 Per|&s;ons, that are yearly cut off, within the Bills of Mortality alone, and tho&s;e generally in the Beginning, or Prime of Life, might be pre&s;erv'd to their King and Country. Let the warm Oppo&s;ers of Inoculation, lay their Hands upon their Hearts, and con&s;ider, whe|ther the &s;aving of &s;o many Lives, be con|trary to any Precept of Law, or Go&s;pel.

<P>I Was very much &s;urpriz'd to find it in|&s;erted in &s;everal of the News Papers of the la&s;t Po&s;t, as a current Report, that I had been lately call'd to a Patient, who was in|oculated about a Year ago, and who is &s;ince dead of the natural Small Pox; and I cou'd not omit this fir&s;t Opportunity to a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;aid Report is entirely fal&s;e, none who have been inoculated, having died of the natural Small Pox afterwards, neither have we any Rea&s;on to think wor&s;e of the Practice here, than when I writ to you la&s;t, tho' we were far from expecting that any Thing, in this World, &s;hould be &s;o compleat, as to be free from all Inconveniencies and Misfortunes. The Method has not been at|tended with any Di&s;a&s;ter in the&s;e Parts, ex|cepting only one, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, gave Ri&s;e to the&s;e Reports in the publick Papers, and of which, I &s;hall give you a very particular Relation; for I &s;hou'd be highly blameable, if I did either conceal, or mi&s;repre&s;ent any Circum&s;tance relating to a Matter of &s;o great Con&s;equence to Mankind.</P>

<P>THERE have been &s;ome Occurrences here, in the Method of Inoculation, which have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, of which it is nece&s;&s;ary the Publick &s;hould have a true
<PB N="35" REF="40">and impartial Account. It was altogether a Mi&s;take to affirm, that one who had been inoculated a Year ago, was lately dead of the natural Small Pox: But it is very true, that one who had the Small Pox by In|oculation did die; and al&s;o, that two others, whom we attempted to inoculate, but with|out Effect, had the Di&s;temper afterwards in the natural Way. The Facts are contain'd in the following Certificates, which will be at|te&s;ted upon Oath, by the Parties concern'd, whenever it &s;hall be requir'd.</P>
<P>We have Rea&s;on to believe, that the Death of the Child hereafter mention'd, was owing to &s;ome other Cau&s;e be&s;ides the Small Pox; but if, to avoid Di&s;pute, we yield that Point, it mu&s;t then be acknowledged, that out of Seventy four, who had the Small Pox by In|oculation hereabouts, one has died; all the re&s;t are at this Time alive, and in good Health.</P>
<P>We have been told by all tho&s;e, who have writ upon the Subject of Inoculation, that it may &s;ometimes fail, and produce nothing at all; in which Ca&s;e, it can be no more Secu|rity again&s;t the Di&s;temper, than if nothing had been done. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have been inoculated here, have been as much expos'd, as the&s;e two Children who have taken the Infection &s;ince; but we have not yet found, that any, who had the Small Pox by this Method, tho' in the lowe&s;t Degree, ever had it again in the natural Way. If any &s;uch Thing &s;hould happen, I &s;hall not fail to ad|vi&s;e you of it. There has nothing occurr'd

<P>The&s;e may certify, that in <HI>February,</HI> 1721/2, the Small Pox was inoculated upon two of our Daughters, the one about five, and the other four Years of Age, who had, as far as we could judge, the true Small Pox, through which Di&s;temper they got with very great Ea&s;e. Some time after, the &s;ame Operation was perform'd upon a Boy of ours, aged about three Years, but without any Effect: The Child was not in the lea&s;t di&s;order'd, had no Appearances upon his Skin, neither did the Places of Inci&s;ion &s;well or inflame as in the other Children, &s;o that we then concluded it would avail him nothing. About five Months ago, the Di&s;temper being then in the Neigh|bourhood, and &s;everal having dy'd of it in the natural Way; we had the Small Pox ino|culated upon a Daughter of ours, aged about 15 Months; with this Child the Di&s;temper was more &s;evere than u&s;ual; &s;he was very full, tho' the Pu&s;tules were di&s;tinct. She went on as well as we cou'd expect, and on the eleventh Day, was very chearful and bri&s;k, free from Heat or Thir&s;t, and the Small Pox were many of them cru&s;ted and
<PB N="37" REF="42">gone off, in&s;omuch, that we thought her out of Danger: However, that Night &s;he died &s;uddenly, even before any Alteration for the wor&s;e was perceiv'd by tho&s;e that attended her. This unhappy Event may po&s;&s;ibly ex|po&s;e us to the Cen&s;ure of the World; but the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done our Duty in u&s;ing the mo&s;t likely Means, to pre&s;erve Life in a Time of common Danger, makes us ea|&s;y and content. About ten Days after this, our Son abovemention'd, upon whom the Inoculation had no Effect, was &s;eized in the natural Way, had a very kindly Sort, and recover'd very well. The Di&s;temper was, at that Time, very rife in two or three neigh|bouring Families, in&s;omuch, that none e&s;|cap'd, who had not had it before; among&s;t the&s;e, there were &s;ix Per&s;ons who had the Small Pox by Inoculation, &s;ome of which were con&s;tantly, and the re&s;t frequently, in Company with tho&s;e that were &s;ick of the natural Sort, without being any Way affected.</P>

The Boy was from one that was inoculated; but I had the Misfortune to come too late; the Pu&s;tules were wither'd, and almo&s;t gone, and the Matter was chiefly taken from the Inci&s;ion in the Arm. I did not think nece&s;&s;a|ry to mention this Particular, in the Ac|count I gave of this Boy formerly, becau&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="44">I could not conclude from one Tryal, any Thing certainly. It is now very well known, that the Matter taken from the Pu&s;tules of the inoculated Small Pox, will convey the Di&s;temper, as well as the natural; but I be|lieve, that which runs from the Inci&s;ions will not. I can give no Account how the Opera|tion happen'd to fail in Mr. <HI>Brook&s;bank</HI>'s Boy; for two other Children were inoculated at the &s;ame Time, with the &s;ame Matter, in whom it &s;ucceeded very well.</P>
