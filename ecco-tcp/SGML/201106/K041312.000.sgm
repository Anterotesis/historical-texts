<HEAD>THE Old MAN's GUIDE.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTHFUL old age is the mo&s;t valuable and happy period of hu|man Life. Experience has ren|der'd the antient more able than tho&s;e who have &s;een le&s;s, and felt le&s;s, to con|duct them&s;elves and their de&s;cendants; and being freed from the empire of the pa&s;|&s;ions they enjoy quiet.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy pretends to this condition; but age gives it truly. Whatever their heirs may think, it is worth pre&s;erving; and in that &s;en&s;e I write the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>A hundred are cut off at this advanced period, by di&s;orders which a proper regi|men might have prevented, for one who dies of age, or its unavoidable effects. Many fall by accidents, to one who is fairly call'd away by nature: and the&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="4">accidents and di&s;orders it is propo&s;ed here to give the means of avoiding.</P>
<P>Old mens di&s;ea&s;es are hard to cure, but they are ea&s;ily prevented: and the &s;ame means which pre&s;erve their health give happine&s;s. It mu&s;t be a good natural fa|brick which has pre&s;erved it&s;elf entire &s;o long, and thro' &s;o many chances; and the &s;ame &s;trength will keep it, perhaps, much longer together under a good re|gulation.</P>
<P>Moderate diet and proper exerci&s;e are the be&s;t guardians of the health of old and young: and in the advanced period here con&s;idered there are two great pre|&s;ervatives be&s;ides; the&s;e are EASE OF MIND and CHEERFULNESS OF DISPOSITION, both are the natural offspring of health; and they will continue the ble&s;&s;ing to which they owe their origin.</P>
<P>We &s;hall con&s;ider fir&s;t the hale and healthy old man; and afterwards the weakly, and the &s;ick: for our purpo&s;e is fir&s;t to direct tho&s;e how to pre&s;erve health who have it, and afterwards to re&s;tore, or to recover it where it is attack'd or en|feebled by di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> How the old man may know he is in health.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS allow'd that we know &s;o little of nothing, as of our&s;elves: It has been &s;aid principally of the mind, but it is &s;carce le&s;s true of the body. The fancying we have di&s;ea&s;es will often bring them upon us; and there is as much danger in forcing our&s;elves to believe again&s;t our feel|ing, that we are well, when &s;ome di&s;order is in the body. This is the le&s;s common error; but there are more in&s;tances of it than may be thought.</P>
<P>To avoid both let the old man read here with a free mind. Let him not &s;up|po&s;e, becau&s;e God has ble&s;&s;ed him with long health, he is above the reach of &s;ick|ne&s;s; nor neglect the care which may conquer, in its beginning, a di&s;ea&s;e that will el&s;e in the end conquer him. Let him be as ready to acknowledge real di&s;|orders, as careful to avoid the imaginary.</P>
<P>Health con&s;i&s;ts in a good dige&s;tion of the food, and a free circulation of the blood. The appetite and the condition of the &s;tomach after eating will &s;hew the fir&s;t; and the latter may be known be&s;t by the pul&s;e.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>That old per&s;on's dige&s;tion is good, who has a &s;harp but not voracious appetite; and who feels no pain or &s;ickne&s;s after meals. To pre&s;erve this let him always be content with le&s;s than the full of what he could eat: for the &s;ure way to keep the &s;tomach in order is not to overload it.</P>
<P>The time of feeling the pul&s;e is in a morning, &s;ome time after getting up, and before breakfa&s;t. It &s;hould be a rule never to omit this examination. A con|&s;tant and regular attention to it will &s;hew the &s;lighte&s;t variations; and whenever &s;uch happen, care mu&s;t be taken of the health.</P>
<P>There are mechanical methods of count|ting the &s;trokes by a watch; but the plainer way is better. The general regular mea|&s;ure is &s;eventy-four &s;trokes in a minute: but pul&s;es differ greatly in various per&s;ons; and nature may be injur'd by forcing her toward a condition &s;he, perhaps, never had, nor requires.</P>
<P>A frequent examination will inform any per&s;on what is the condition of the pul&s;e when in health; and the deviations from this are the rules to know &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>While an old man feels his pul&s;e re|gular, finds his dige&s;tion good, and with a mind at ea&s;e can take his u&s;ual exerci&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="7">freely, he may laugh at the expectation of the next in inheritance: he may be cer|tain he is well; and we &s;hall tell him how to keep &s;o: For when the fault is &s;een in time it is ea&s;ily remedy'd. If the pul&s;e beat too quick and high the diet mu&s;t be a little lower; if too &s;low, and weak, the food mu&s;t be richer. This &s;hort direction will prevent di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The doctors will not thank me for this, but I do not write it for their &s;ervice: they mu&s;t own 'tis true, tho' they di&s;|like the publi&s;hing it. If men would pay more regard to their own con&s;titutions, they would want little of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; which always comes too late to prevent mi&s;chief; and often to relieve it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of pre&s;erving a healthful &s;tate in old age.</HEAD>
<P>EXERCISE has thro' the younger part of life been very in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving the health: when we grow old we cannot u&s;e &s;o much; and we mu&s;t therefore be doubly careful in our diet. That will go off with exerci&s;e, which will overload the body when kept quiet: that will nouri&s;h while we walk abroad, which, when we &s;tay at home, breeds fevers. The
<PB N="8" REF="8">le&s;s exerci&s;e we u&s;e the le&s;s we &s;hould eat; and what we do &s;hould be of the milder nature.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not make this change violent|ly: for all &s;udden alterations in the diet are dangerous. Our &s;trength for exerci&s;e will leave us by degrees, and we mu&s;t re|duce our food in quantity and quality ac|cordingly; by a little at a time, not by a har&s;h change at once.</P>
<P>Winter is the &s;ea&s;on when old men are lea&s;t healthy; therefore they mu&s;t then be mo&s;t careful. They are colder than young per&s;ons, therefore cold more affects them. The weakne&s;s of their circulation makes them cold, and this is known by their feeble and &s;low pul&s;e. They will know therefore that the cold weather has hurt them, when they perceive the pul&s;e more weak and &s;low than u&s;ual; and they mu&s;t pre&s;erve them&s;elves again&s;t it; and recover the new damage by more warmth, and a &s;omewhat higher diet.</P>
<P>If per&s;piration have been &s;top'd by ex|ternal cold, and no other ill effect follow, it will be &s;een by the urine being paler and more in quantity than u&s;ual. In this ca&s;e let flannel be put on carefully, it will encrea&s;e, or re&s;tore the per&s;piration, and the urine will come to its due colour and
<PB N="9" REF="9">quantity: after that let it be very carefully left off again.</P>
<P>The good we &s;hew it can do, proves it may al&s;o do harm. Health con&s;i&s;ts in the evacuations having all their proper cour&s;e and quantity; and flannel will dimini&s;h one as much as it encrea&s;es another.</P>
<P>No di&s;order is more trouble&s;ome to old people than co&s;tivene&s;s: and the u&s;e of flan|nel improperly will &s;ometimes occa&s;ion this; by taking off too much of the natural moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>By this, as by the other rules, the old per&s;on will &s;ee that a careful attention to his health is the only way to pre&s;erve it: and that things are excellent when properly u&s;ed, which may otherwi&s;e be de&s;truc|tive.</P>
<P>If the appetite fail, or wind oppre&s;s the &s;tomach after meals, let the per&s;on take more air, and exerci&s;e; and read or &s;tudy le&s;s: for much &s;tudy always hurts the dige&s;tion; and when that is impaired, wor&s;e mi&s;chiefs will follow.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the diet of old men.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been cu&s;tomary to recommend a particular diet to old per&s;ons; as if one cour&s;e of living could &s;uit all con&s;ti|tutions: but this is very wrong. Old men differ as much from one another, as old from young; and according to their &s;e|veral con&s;titutions, a various cour&s;e of life is nece&s;&s;ary in this re&s;pect. There|fore we &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h no peculiar diet as fit for every old per&s;on; but only lay down certain general rules. The&s;e will hold univer&s;ally, becau&s;e they are calculated for old people, merely as they are old; not as they are of one or another con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Lighter diet is more proper for aged per&s;ons than young; and this in their li|quors as well as &s;olid food.</P>
<P>Beef and pork &s;hould be avoided: for the &s;tomach will rarely be able to dige&s;t the&s;e when it is not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Lamb, veal, pig, chickens, and tame rabbet are very excellent food for old per&s;ons; and out of the&s;e, if there are no others, a tolerable management may pro|duce &s;ufficient variety.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<P>No aged per&s;on &s;hould eat more than one meal of &s;olid food in the day. The &s;tomach will be able to manage a dinner when the breakfa&s;t and &s;upper have been light: otherwi&s;e the load of one meal not being gone off before another is brought in, neither will be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tantial meal &s;hould be dinner; and this &s;hould not be eaten too early, that the appetite may not be violent for &s;upper. It has been ob&s;erved already, that the quantity of food at a meal &s;hould be le&s;s for old per&s;ons than for young: and the older they grow, the more this &s;hould be dimini&s;hed. This was the prac|tice of Hippocrates; and by the ob&s;erv|ance of it Carnaro lived to his extreme age.</P>
<P>This regulation principally concerns dinner, which is the capital meal: with re|&s;pect to &s;upper, the lighter it is the better; though we do not agree with tho&s;e who advi&s;e the omitting that meal intirely. Moderation is the rule of health in all life; but mo&s;t of all in the old man's life. They were in the right who declared the mi&s;chief of &s;olid or heavy &s;uppers; but the poets have long &s;ince &s;aid what &s;ort of people tho&s;e are, who, in avoiding a fault, ru&s;h into its contrary. There is a
<PB N="12" REF="12">medium between a heavy &s;upper and emp|tine&s;s; and this is be&s;t. Since all agree &s;olid food at this meal is wrong, let the old man eat liquid; and of all liquid diets, tho&s;e which are partly compo&s;ed of milk are be&s;t.</P>
<P>'Tis only in the extreme of age that men become children again in their un|der&s;tandings; but in their bodily faculties they approach this condition &s;ooner: for they grow weak as they grow aged, and weakne&s;s is weakne&s;s whether it be in old men or children. For this rea&s;on the food of children is fit for them, at lea&s;t in the le&s;&s;er meal. Their dige&s;tive faculties are le&s;s powerful; but milk is in a manner ready dige&s;ted. They want an ea&s;y nou|ri&s;hment; and this affords it, without loading the &s;tomach, or oppre&s;&s;ing it dur|ing the hours of re&s;t.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;es milk is mo&s;t ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and mo&s;t nouri&s;hing; and a pint of that, with a &s;mall toa&s;t, eaten two hours before bed-time, will be nouri&s;hing, and &s;it ea&s;y on the &s;tomach. The value of a&s;&s;es milk is its lightne&s;s: that of the cow is richer and heavier. Tho&s;e who u&s;e the latter in this ca&s;e in the country &s;hould mix it fir&s;t with equal parts of &s;oft water: in London
<PB N="13" REF="13">this care is unnece&s;&s;ary, tho&s;e who &s;ell milk do it for them.</P>
<P>There are many other methods in which milk is plea&s;ant and proper: milk pottage, thin rice milk, and other &s;uch di&s;hes, will give a variety without having re|cour&s;e to other things. But &s;ome farther change is not denied them: weak broths of veal, chicken, and mutton may be eat occa&s;ionally; and gellies hone&s;tly made at home, are proper, &s;afe, and nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>With this choice, the old man need not de&s;ire meat &s;uppers; and the&s;e things will an&s;wer the double purpo&s;e of nouri&s;hing and moi&s;tening the body; for aged per&s;ons are naturally too dry in their con&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t is the only meal remain|ing to be con&s;idered, and this is not a very important one. Tho&s;e who eat no &s;upper are too hungry in a morning; and the &s;tomach is loaded with what they take at that time, and therefore is the le&s;s able to dige&s;t a dinner.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on we advi&s;e old per|&s;ons to eat &s;uppers, provided they be of a right kind; the&s;e take off the edge of the morning's appetite, and there will remain ju&s;t &s;o much de&s;ire to eat as will
<PB N="14" REF="14">lead them to get &s;omething into the &s;to|mach without loading it.</P>
<P>This is nece&s;&s;ary to health. We know men may fa&s;t away their appetite; and their power of dige&s;tion goes in a great mea&s;ure with it. The conduct of the ap|petite regulates the health; and this is not enough regarded. Young people may take liberties with them&s;elves; for nature is &s;trong: but the older mu&s;t pay more regard to her weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is as e&s;&s;ential to health not to keep the &s;tomach empty, as not to overload it. Wind is the con&s;equence of emptyne&s;s, and this di&s;turbs the office of the &s;tomach. It &s;hould be always kept at its due em|ployment in advanced periods of life; and this by &s;mall quantities of proper food.</P>
<P>For the&s;e plain rea&s;ons, breakfa&s;ts are as proper, nay as nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;uppers. Tho&s;e who are troubled with phlegm &s;hould eat le&s;s at this meal than others; but all &s;hould eat &s;ome. A cup of chocolate, not made too &s;trong, is a good breakfa&s;t. Coffee I cannot advi&s;e generally: but the exceptions again&s;t tea, are in a great mea|&s;ure groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who drink a great quantity of tea, and are carele&s;s in the making it, u&s;ing a bad kind, and drinking the la&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="15">di&s;hes cool and palled, will unque&s;tion|ably weaken their &s;tomachs: but this is not the ca&s;e with &s;uch as are more care|ful. If the old man likes tea he need not deny it to him&s;elf for breakfa&s;t. Let him u&s;e the plain green tea, of &s;ixteen &s;hillings a pound; and make it well: taking care water boils, and allowing &s;o much tea that it may be of &s;ufficient &s;trength with|out &s;tanding too long upon the leaves. This way we have the &s;pirit, flavour, and virtue of the plant; whereas weak, half cold, bad tea has ju&s;t the contrary qual|ties.</P>
<P>Let the old man drink three moderate cups of this tea, with a little &s;ugar and a good deal of milk; and &s;wallow it neither too hot, nor mawki&s;hly cool. Let him eat with it a thin &s;lice or two of good bread, with a little butter; and he will find it nouri&s;hing and excellent.</P>
<P>The virtues of tea thus drank are as con&s;iderable as its bad qualities when ill managed. In this manner, it &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion: it keeps the body from being empty without loading it: and the appetite for dinner will be the better, and the dige&s;tion al&s;o more perfect. To this we are to add, that tea in this quantity is &s;ufficient for
<PB N="16" REF="16">the great purpo&s;e of diluting; and that it refre&s;hes the &s;pirits more than any other liquid.</P>
<P>The be&s;t drink at meals is malt liquor, not too &s;trong, and neither new nor &s;tale. For this rea&s;on &s;mall ale is better than table-beer, becau&s;e it will bear keeping to a due time for &s;afe u&s;e. For the more cordial liquors wine is the be&s;t. A little of this is nece&s;&s;ary to old men, and ac|cording to the con&s;titution and former manner of life, more may be born with|out inconvenience, or indeed with advan|tage. The kind of wine mu&s;t be &s;uited to the peculiarity of the con&s;titution; of which we &s;hall treat hereafter: here we &s;peak generally. But for mo&s;t old per&s;ons of all wines &s;ack is the be&s;t, if it can be obtained pure and genuine.</P>
<P>As occa&s;ion &s;hall require the &s;upper foods here directed may be u&s;ed by way of dinner; and broths may be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome times for breakfa&s;t. This will be known from the circum&s;tances. When the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t &s;olids, the&s;e liquid nouri&s;hments mu&s;t &s;upply the place; and when more nouri&s;hing things are wanted, a broth breakfa&s;t is excellent. Vipers are extolled, but 'tis an idle fancy: I have
<PB N="17" REF="17">found, on repeated tryals, broth of veal and chickens is better.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the foods old men &s;hould avoid.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER directing what is proper, we &s;hall conclude this article of diet, by pointing out tho&s;e things which are hurtful to per&s;ons advanced in years: and this is the more nece&s;&s;ary becau&s;e many of them are un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Every thing that is heavy, and hard of dige&s;tion, mu&s;t be avoided: and tho' vege|tables may be thought innocent, there are many ca&s;es in which they prove hurtful.</P>
<P>No general prai&s;e, or general cen&s;ure, can be pa&s;&s;ed upon them in this re&s;pect; for they differ according to their kinds as much as animal foods.</P>
<P>Carrots are to be avoided, for no old &s;tomach can dige&s;t them. On the con|trary potatoes are innocent, and par&s;nips are nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Among herbage raw &s;allads &s;hould be &s;hunned: cabbage, and all its kinds, breed wind, and are therefore wrong: but a&s;paragus is diuretick; and is excellent
<PB N="18" REF="18">again&s;t that common old man's com|plaint, the gravel.</P>
<P>Heavy chee&s;e &s;hould be carefully a|voided; and there is nothing wor&s;e than eating too much butter: but very fine Che&s;hire chee&s;e, or the parmezan in a &s;mall quantity after other food, are not ami&s;s.</P>
<P>All &s;harp ta&s;ted things, whether food or drink, are carefully to be &s;hunned. They cannot be neutral upon the &s;to|mach; and they are much more likely to do harm than good. Such things are to be con&s;idered as medicines, and as care|fully u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fruits in general are to be avoided by old men; but of all others, mo&s;t carefully raw pears.</P>
<P>Wall-fruit, and the other produce of our garden trees and &s;hrubs, when they have grown in a good &s;oil, and are exact|ly of a due degree of ripene&s;s, are inno|cent: but this is the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of them, and to de&s;erve this all tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances are requi&s;ite; otherwi&s;e they hurt the &s;tomach and often bring on cholicks.</P>
<P>Cucumbers, and the like productions of the kitchen garden, weaken the dige&s;|tion,
<PB N="19" REF="19">and greatly prevent the natural and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>The pine-apple, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant of all fruit, is the mo&s;t dangerous. Its &s;harp|ne&s;s fleas the mouth, and 'tis ea&s;y to know what effect &s;uch a thing mu&s;t have upon the &s;tomach and bowels of per&s;ons weak|ened by age. I have known it bring on bloody fluxes, which have been fatal. There are &s;everal kinds of this fruit &s;ome|what differing in quality, and the per|fect degree of ripene&s;s in a great mea&s;ure takes off its bad effects; but the&s;e are nice di&s;tinctions; and he who is wi&s;e will judge as he does of mu&s;hrooms; where many are dangerous, avoid all.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide avoiding things which are hurt|ful in them&s;elves, tho&s;e who are far ad|vanced in years &s;hould be upon their guard again&s;t &s;uch as they are not accu&s;tom'd to. Particular con&s;titutions, in medicine, will &s;hew unfore&s;een aver&s;ions to parti|cular things: and it is the &s;ame in foods. Let him who knows what agrees with him &s;tick to that. Change is wrong, and it may be hazardous: and 'tis idle to run into the way of danger when there is no advantage.</P>
<P>All mixtures of food upon the &s;tomach are bad; and there is not a greater
<PB N="20" REF="20">error in an old per&s;on than to eat of many things at one meal. He mu&s;t not deceive him&s;elf by arguing that all are innocent: two things of known qualities will often on the mixing produce a third that is per|fectly different from them both: and the&s;e are dangerous trials in an old man's &s;to|mach.</P>
<P>The management in the&s;e articles is nearly as important as the choice; and a regularity of eating is the next care to the &s;electing proper food, and fixing on a right quantity.</P>

<P>It is &s;trange, that many live to a great age in London, where the air has neither of the&s;e characters; where we breathe &s;moak, and the mixt &s;tench of a thou&s;and putrifying &s;ub&s;tances, which cannot eva|porate through the thick and foul atmo&s;|phere of the place.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="21">
<P>But though none will que&s;tion the &s;u|perior quality of a clear country air, yet let not him who has attained to a healthy three&s;core and ten, then think of leaving London, to continue his days to a longer period. They &s;ay u&s;e is a &s;econd nature. It becomes nature it&s;elf: and bad things, to which an old man has been very long accu&s;tomed, are better than &s;udden chan|ges. It is well known, &s;ome who have reached an uncommon date of life, have peri&s;hed at la&s;t by a &s;udden change in their food: and the air is &s;carce of le&s;s con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>He who would increa&s;e the period, and the healthy condition of his days by a country air, &s;hould begin it at an earlier time; when his con&s;titution can better bear the &s;hock of alteration.</P>
<P>In regard to choice of air, the rea&s;on we declare again&s;t that which is too bleak is plain: for bleak and cold are always found together. Cold air chills the blood, and in old men we want rather to warm it. This is the air at the tops of hills: and &s;uch &s;ituations all old men &s;hould avoid.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the warme&s;t air of the country is that of vallies, &s;heltered by ri&s;ing grounds; but this is u&s;ually
<PB N="22" REF="22">damp; and more mi&s;chief will ari&s;e from it than good.</P>
<P>Therefore the choice re&s;ts &s;olely upon a gentle a&s;cent: the be&s;t place of all is toward the bottom of a ground, which does not in any part ri&s;e to a very great height; and if there be a running water at the bottom it is &s;o far perfect.</P>
<P>But more than this mu&s;t be con&s;ulted for the country re&s;idence of the old man, or of any who would live to be old. The &s;oil is of va&s;t con&s;equence; and &s;o is the ex|po&s;ure. A clayey bottom mu&s;t be avoided; becau&s;e it is always cold, and the air about it raw and damp. Rains cannot get thro' it, and they lodge till they are evaporated, chilling the ground, and loading the air with their moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>A clean gravel is the be&s;t of all. The air over this is warm, and naturally dry; for rain &s;oaks through it.</P>
<P>The north and north-ea&s;t winds are wor&s;t for old men: therefore let them &s;helter them&s;elves from the&s;e by a proper choice of &s;ituation. Let the de&s;cent of the ground face the &s;outh-we&s;t; and then the natural ri&s;e will keep off the bleak and cold air from the oppo&s;ite quarters. This may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted al&s;o by plantations of trees; and thus the true &s;eat of health and plea|&s;ure
<PB N="23" REF="23">may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o far as the&s;e great points concern them.</P>
<P>He is happy who has made &s;uch a choice in time; and he &s;till happier who finds him|&s;elf now in good time to make it. The later &s;uch a re&s;idence is cho&s;en, the more care|fully mu&s;t the owner accu&s;tom him&s;elf to it: fir&s;t in &s;ummer; and by degrees and at times at other periods of the year. An air thus cho&s;en, will then give all the great articles age wants, appetite, dige&s;tion, and a free circulation.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e will be ea&s;y; and it will be plea&s;ant in &s;uch a &s;pot: but let this be under the regulation of good &s;en&s;e. No|thing is better than walking; but let not the old man do him&s;elf more hurt by a ra&s;h and carele&s;s indulgence in this than it can do him &s;ervice. Let him never enjoy the air but when it is in a condition to do him good, nor venture upon the ground but when it is fit for his feet.</P>
<P>No country hou&s;e is without a garden; and the be&s;t part of this will be a good gravel walk. Let it be open to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and well defended from the dangerous quarters. Let it be laid toler|ably round, that the water may not lodge; and let it be kept well rolled, hard and &s;mooth.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
<P>In favourable weather he may walk in pathways in the fields: but in &s;uch as is not &s;o good, this walk will be highly u&s;eful: let him never come upon it till the dew is off the gra&s;s; and let the &s;etting &s;un be the la&s;t object he &s;ees from it; even in the be&s;t weather.</P>
<P>The air of early morning and of late evening is cold and unwhole&s;ome: but &s;ome hours of the fir&s;t part of the day, pa&s;&s;ed con&s;tantly on &s;uch a walk, will add many years to life; and what is much better, it will give health with them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of exerci&s;e for old men.</HEAD>
<P>AIR led us to mention already the fir&s;t of exerci&s;es, which is walking; and for tho&s;e who can indulge them&s;elves in this, there is none better: but feeble|ne&s;s and various accidents often deny its u&s;e to tho&s;e who mo&s;t of all want mo|tion. In this ca&s;e, riding on hor&s;eback is the next in excellence. And the be&s;t hours of the day mu&s;t be cho&s;en for that, in the &s;ame manner as for the other. In &s;evere weather it is nece&s;&s;ary to keep un|der &s;helter; and at all times to avoid damp or bleak places.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="25">
<P>Diver&s;ions afford excellent exerci&s;e. Bowling is one: but the &s;ame care mu&s;t be taken, that this be at a proper time. A chariot may &s;upply the place of a hor&s;e to tho&s;e who are more feeble; and when even this is too much, there will be a great deal of good in being driven along in tho&s;e chairs which are made to run about gar|den-walks.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are fond of gardening, nothing affords &s;o happy, or &s;o con&s;tant exerci&s;e. We do not mean that they &s;hould dig, or weed the ground: but that employment which will give exerci&s;e without labour, and which no hand will &s;o well perform as that of the Ma&s;ter; the trimming of &s;hrubs, and flowering plants, the management of e&s;paliers; the removal of &s;eedling-flowers; the thining of fruit upon the trees; and the following and overlooking the other &s;everal works. Here will at lea&s;t be more and more bri&s;k walking than otherwi&s;e; and in many things the little u&s;e of the hands will com|pleat that exerci&s;e; continuing it perfect|ly through the body.</P>
<P>The only danger of this healthy and happy cour&s;e, is that it is too tempting. Let him who falls into it take an invariable
<PB N="26" REF="26">re&s;olution, never to let his fondne&s;s for the garden carry him out too early, or keep him out too late.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of &s;uccedaneums for exerci&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE benefit of exerci&s;e all know; but all cannot take it. The wea|ther will &s;ometimes deny the u&s;e of tho&s;e kinds we have named to &s;uch as are mo&s;t able to take them: and in this ca&s;e, any bu&s;tling about within doors, whether in the light of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement, will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. The adju&s;ting an e&s;critoire, or the new arranging the vo|lumes in a book-ca&s;e have often produced this good effect; and billiards, or other entertainments which afford means of &s;tir|ring within the hou&s;e, an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are too weak for exer|ci&s;e, even the milde&s;t, and in the be&s;t weather, the be&s;t relief is a fle&s;h-bru&s;h; and its effects are more than can be ima|gined. We know what we expect from exerci&s;e; and in old men, the greate&s;t of its advantages is the a&s;&s;i&s;ting circulation. The fle&s;h-bru&s;h does this nearly in as
<PB N="27" REF="27">great a degree, excepting for the imme|diate time: but to have the full benefit, it mu&s;t be con&s;tantly and frequently repeated.</P>
<P>Another excellent &s;uccedaneum for ex|erci&s;e is wa&s;hing the body with warm water and rubbing it very well with re|peated dry cloaths afterwards. This has many peculiar advantages: the warmth a&s;&s;i&s;ts per&s;piration; the wa&s;hing opens the pores; and the rubing afterwards is at lea&s;t equal to the effect of the fle&s;h-bru&s;h. The warmth and moi&s;ture join al&s;o in &s;oftening the &s;kin, and rendering it &s;upple; and this is a great point, for it is apt to grow hard and dry with age.</P>
<P>Care mu&s;t be taken to avoid taking cold after this. The be&s;t time for it is even|ing in a warm bedchamber; and the bed &s;hould be ready immediately, that the per&s;on may go into it hot.</P>
<P>The hands and feet &s;hould have their full &s;hare in this wa&s;hing and rubing, for the circulation is weake&s;t there, and the pores are mo&s;t liable to be &s;toped. The warm bath an&s;wers, in &s;ome degree, this purpo&s;e; and will be &s;poken of hereafter: but it is rather to be u&s;ed as a remedy than a pre&s;ervative; and we are here treating of old men in health.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="28">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of a regulation of the temper. And of the pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT entering into the pro|vince of the morali&s;t or preacher, we may &s;ay the pa&s;&s;ions demand great re|gard in pre&s;erving the health of old men. The motion of the blood in circulation is greatly affected and altered by them; and the nerves &s;uffer more. The whole frame is di&s;ordered; and I have often &s;een di&s;|ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes immediate death the con&s;equence of giving full way to them.</P>
<P>Nothing in this world is worth the trouble and di&s;tre&s;s men bring upon them|&s;elves about it, by giving way to immo|derate pa&s;&s;ions. Life is the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ing, and health the next; and the&s;e &s;uffer by that fond indulgence.</P>
<P>That the circulation is di&s;ordered by pa&s;&s;ions, we know from the true and certain indication of the pul&s;e. In anger it beats violent and hard; in grief faint and &s;low; terrors make it irregular; and &s;hame impedes its motions.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="29">
<P>The&s;e are &s;ure notices of a di&s;ordered circulation; and old men cannot bear this even for a time without damage. The &s;trength of youth re&s;tores all to its for|mer &s;tate when the gu&s;t is over: but age is weak, and cannot. Philo&s;ophy teaches the governing our pa&s;&s;ions; and it is true wi&s;dom. The old man &s;hould love him|&s;elf too well to indulge them. It is not worth his while. Quiet and regularity of life in every re&s;pect are his bu&s;ine&s;s: and as he is pa&s;t the fluttering plea&s;ures of youth, let him place him&s;elf above its troubles.</P>
<P>Good humour, and a &s;atisfaction of mind will give the aged many more years, and much happine&s;s in them. Di&s;con|tent and di&s;turbance wear out nature: but the temper, we advi&s;e, pre&s;erves her in good condition.</P>
<P>Of all pa&s;&s;ions let the old man avoid a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s for women. This ne|ver will &s;olicit him, for nature knows her own time, and the appetite decays with the power; but if he &s;olicit that which he cannot enjoy, he will di&s;turb his con|&s;titution more than by any other means whatever; and while he is &s;hortening his life; and robing the poor remainder
<PB N="30" REF="30">he allows of peace, he will be only making him&s;elf the ridicule of tho&s;e who &s;eem to favour his vain and ineffectual de|&s;ires.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ionate people, what we blame as their fault, is often their misfortune. Some, from a tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition, have fixed this humour upon them&s;elves by cu&s;tom, with no other cau&s;e; but for one of the&s;e there are a hundred who&s;e fury of temper is owing to a di&s;order in their body.</P>
<P>We know madne&s;s is a di&s;ea&s;e; and vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion is a temporary madne&s;s. This al&s;o ari&s;es often from a redundance of hu|mours, and medicines will cure it.</P>
<P>Let the pa&s;&s;ionate old man con&s;ider, that he hurts him&s;elf more than any body el&s;e, by his anger; and he will then wi&s;h to be cured of its tyranny. Let him examine him&s;elf, whether it be a di&s;order of his mind; and his phy&s;ician, whether it lie in his body. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e the re|medy is philo&s;ophy; but in the latter, a few medicines will re&s;tore him to temper: to that temper on which his life and hap|pine&s;s depend.</P>
<P>Let the ha&s;ty old man cool him&s;elf by phy&s;ic and a low diet: and let him who
<PB N="31" REF="31">is melancholy and gloomy bani&s;h the everla&s;ting fear of death by warmer foods, cordial medicines, and that be&s;t of cordials, wine. The&s;e will drive away much more than the apprehen&s;ion of death, they will put off the reality: for melancholy would have &s;unk the feeble, long before his time.</P>
<P>Of all &s;tates in the mind a di&s;turb'd hurry of the nerves is mo&s;t to be avoided. The blood and &s;pirits are di&s;order'd by this much more than by exerci&s;e or bodi|ly motion; and they are much longer in coming to them&s;elves again. Exerci&s;e cea&s;es ab&s;olutely when 'tis over: but the &s;torms of the mind leave a &s;welling &s;ea, which &s;trength of body alone can calm: and in age this &s;trength is faint.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e is more mi&s;chievous to weak old per&s;ons than a purging: and I have &s;een this brought on in&s;tantly by a fit of pa&s;|&s;ion, or a fright. Medicines have at|tempted to relieve the patient in vain. That which would have been &s;top'd, if natural, by a &s;poonful of chalk julep, or a do&s;e of dia&s;cordium, has in this ca&s;e re|duced the per&s;on to a &s;keleton, and &s;unk him into the grave in &s;pite of all help.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="32">
<P>Why &s;hould the old man di&s;turb his mind with pa&s;&s;ion? or what &s;hould he dread? Death is his great terror; and he is very ab&s;urd who brings it on by le&s;&s;er fears.</P>
<P>Joy, tho' only a greater degree of &s;ati&s;|faction, is in a violent or outrageous de|gree as hurtful as the other pa&s;&s;ions: it hurries the circulation vehemently and ir|regularly; it exhau&s;ts the &s;pirits; and it has often occa&s;ioned &s;udden death. It is a violence of youth; it belongs to that period of life properly: that can bear it, and to that let us leave it. Let the old man be as the quakers in this point, al|ways chearful but never merry.</P>
<P>La&s;t let me caution the aged man who would be happy, and would live much longer, to combat with all his power that dangerous enemy covetou&s;ne&s;s. 'Tis known univer&s;ally, and we have &s;acred atte&s;tation of it, that too earne&s;t careful|ne&s;s brings age before its time; and in age it brings death prematurely. The old are in no danger of extravagance, and the care of heaping up for others, when it &s;hortens their own life, is more than any heir can de&s;erve from them.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="33">
<P>Ea&s;e and good humour are the great in|gredients of a happy life, and the principal means of a long one. The whole le&s;&s;on extends but thus much farther, that the old man love life &s;o well, and value &s;o little all the accidents that belong to it, that he do not give a vain attention to a part which may rob him of the whole.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of &s;leep for old men.</HEAD>
<P>INtemperance has converted day into night, in the cour&s;e of the gay young world; but this needs not influence tho&s;e in years. Midnight entertainments are no part of the oeconomy of their peace|ful lives; therefore they may come nearer to the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;leep is a material ar|ticle; and the time not le&s;s. The old man has been cautioned again&s;t the cold air of evenings; and after a light &s;upper, and an hour or two of &s;ocial conver&s;ation with his family and his neighbours, bed will be his be&s;t place.</P>
<P>Sleep was intended to recruit nature, and re&s;tore the wa&s;ted &s;pirits. This is nece&s;&s;ary to all per&s;ons; but to the aged
<PB N="34" REF="34">mo&s;t, becau&s;e they can lea&s;t bear the wa&s;te of them. The pa&s;&s;ions will di&s;|turb all con&s;titutions, but tho&s;e of old per&s;ons mo&s;t: &s;leep compo&s;es the&s;e. There|fore 'tis of excellent u&s;e to them: and they may indulge in it longer than the young.</P>
<P>Six hours is as much as a per&s;on in the prime of life &s;hould &s;leep; but in age eight or ten, according to the peculiar con&s;titution, will be more proper.</P>
<P>The natural &s;ea&s;on of &s;leep is night, and let the old man go to bed in &s;uch time that he may pa&s;s the&s;e hours of re&s;t with|out breaking in upon the morning. In general the mo&s;t healthful cu&s;tom is to go to bed at ten at night, and ri&s;e at eight in the morning.</P>
<P>If the mind be hurry'd, or from any other cau&s;e the per&s;on finds he cannot compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t &s;oon after going to bed, let him &s;till ri&s;e at the &s;ame time the following morning: and the next evening prepare him&s;elf for better &s;leep. Let him go into a warm bath; and in|dulge him&s;elf with a gla&s;s of wine, be|yond the ordinary allowance, a little be|fore bed time. This will take off his watchfulne&s;s; and he will &s;ink into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;lumber.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
<P>The contrary practice of lying in bed in the morning, to make up for want of &s;leep at night, is every way extreamly wrong. As nothing refre&s;hes like &s;ea&s;on|able &s;leep, nothing weakens and dejects a per&s;on more than long lying in bed in the morning. There is al&s;o this far|ther ill con&s;equence, that the per&s;on is never &s;leepy again at the due time of the evening &s;ucceeding; and thus what was at fir&s;t an accident, becomes by indulgence a cu&s;tom; the more difficult to be con|quer'd and the more hurtful.</P>
<P>He who has ob&s;erved a temperate diet, and goes to bed regularly at ten o'clock, will naturally wake towards eight: and when he wakes let him get up: he will then be in &s;pirits for the day. If on the contrary he lies do&s;ing, he will get into a weakening &s;weat: and he will be low &s;pi|rited during the following day; and wak|ing and watchful at night.</P>
<P>On the&s;e little circum&s;tances do the health or &s;ickne&s;s, the happine&s;s or un|ea&s;ine&s;s of old per&s;ons depend in a great mea&s;ure. We do not perceive them, or we overlook them: let us be for the future more careful. There is no pain in the living regularly in old age; and the
<PB N="36" REF="36">con&s;equence of it is certain, a longer life, and every day of it more agreeable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the particular faults in old mens con&s;titutions.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have treated of the condition of per&s;ons advanced in years who are healthy: and the rules we have laid down are for pre&s;erving and continuing that &s;tate. He who ob|&s;erves them duly will not fail of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>We now &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;everal faults in the con&s;titution at this period of life; and the di&s;ea&s;es ri&s;ing from them. The old man may be &s;o far his own doc|tor, as to amend the general di&s;tempera|ture of his body, and to prevent tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es: but if he fall into them, by neglect of the&s;e cautions, or in &s;pite of their force, let him then call in the phy&s;ician. We can advi&s;e him how to pre&s;erve health when he has it; and how to remedy general di&s;orders &s;o as to prevent more particular ones, if a due regimen may do that: but he is a very ill judge of the human frame, who will pre|tend to remedy its di&s;ea&s;es without know|ledge
<PB N="37" REF="37">in its &s;tructure, and the virtues of re|medies: and he would be a bad member of &s;ociety who gave &s;uch advice. It were as ea&s;y to teach any other art by writing; and as rational to attempt making a watchmaker, or a &s;hipbuilder, by de&s;crip|tions of the tools. The whole life of the phy&s;ician &s;pent in attention and experi|ence hardly qualifies him for the un|dertaking: how then &s;hould a few words give due information?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of a fulne&s;s of blood.</HEAD>
<P>AN over-fullne&s;s of blood naturally brings on a redundance of the o|ther humours: for as they are &s;eparated from the blood, they naturally encrea&s;e with it in quantity; and the one or the other may, and naturally will, occa&s;ion di&s;orders; much more both.</P>
<P>The old man may know he has too much blood in his veins from the&s;e plain &s;ymptoms: his pul&s;e will be full and &s;trong, and quicker than it &s;hould; his complexion ruddy; and his urine high coloured. The veins al&s;o will be &s;welled, and his breathing difficult.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="38">
<P>The occa&s;ion of all this has been too large feeding, and too little exerci&s;e: therefore the plain method to abate the &s;ymptoms, and prevent the mi&s;chief they threaten, is by more motion, and an ab|&s;temious diet.</P>
<P>This is the change to be made: but it mu&s;t not be &s;udden. We have ob&s;erved before, that all ha&s;ty alterations are dan|gerous; but as this is &s;lowly, let it be re|gularly brought on. As there is in &s;uch a ca&s;e no di&s;ea&s;e come on as yet from the fulne&s;s, there will not any come on during a gradual cour&s;e of emptying the ve&s;&s;els by this practice. Nature will be relieved thus in a &s;atisfactory manner, whereas &s;he would have been too violently di&s;turbed by a &s;hock.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rule is to retrench one third part from the fle&s;h eaten at dinner; of whatever kind that be. We have advi&s;ed the ab&s;taining from beef and pork: but in this ca&s;e mutton &s;hould be al&s;o let alone, or very rarely eaten; and the din|ner being made &s;olely of the tender and young meats in this reduced quantity; and the next care mu&s;t be, that the&s;e are al|ways well and thoroughly done.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="39">
<P>Let the per&s;on ri&s;e an hour before the u&s;ual time in a morning, and every day encrea&s;e the quantity of exerci&s;e a little: but with great care not to go out at im|proper hours to endanger taking cold. In getting rid of one evil let us not run into another. This fulne&s;s is a &s;tate in which di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t ea&s;ily brought on, and will be mo&s;t violent. Colds are very dangerous to people in this condition, and therefore are mo&s;t carefully to be avoided.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e will &s;hew whether this method reduces the redundance: and if it do not take a vi&s;ible effect in five days, it will be proper to be blooded. After this the &s;ame regimen will compleat the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and there will be no need for medicines.</P>
<P>If all this fail, the warm bath every other day will probably an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. In all old mens ca&s;es 'tis be&s;t to avoid medicines, if it could be done with &s;afety; for they di&s;turb the con&s;titu|tion: and the be&s;t guard of the&s;e per&s;ons health is quietne&s;s.</P>

<P>WHEN old per&s;ons fall into this condition, it generally carries them off. But many may be &s;aved by timely care, to whom no remedies will be of &s;ervice after a fir&s;t neglect.

If it be too &s;trong, or if he take too much, the dige&s;tive faculty, impaired by general weakne&s;s, cannot manage it. He will ha&s;|ten his death by &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>The rule is to eat only innocent and nouri&s;hing things, and the&s;e in moderate quantities: chicken, young lamb, and veal boiled down almo&s;t to jelly, are the pro|per foods for dinner, and of the&s;e let him eat le&s;s than his appetite demands.</P>
<P>Two hours before dinner, let him take half a pint of chicken broth; and as his
<PB N="41" REF="41">his &s;tomach &s;trengthens, veal or mutton broth; and the &s;ame one hour after his light dinner.</P>
<P>Let the breakfa&s;t be a yolk of an egg, beaten up with half a pint of a&s;&s;es milk, and a quarter of an ounce of con&s;erve of ro&s;es: and his &s;upper veal broth nearly boiled to a jelly.</P>
<P>Every afternoon let him take half a pint of a&s;&s;es milk alone: and while this is doing, let there be no violent evacuations. A purging would be de&s;tructive; and morn|ing &s;weats are very hurtful. Let him there|fore ri&s;e early: and to compleat the cure, let him believe the&s;e methods will perform it: an ea&s;y mind will do more than food or phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Quiet, good humour, and complacen|cy of temper will prevent half the di&s;ea&s;es of old people; and cure many of the others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Again&s;t &s;harp humours.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ign of &s;harp humours in the bodies of old per&s;ons is an un|ea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;tomach: then comes on a want of appetite, with &s;our belchings, wind, purgings, and defluctions; thir&s;t, and a feveri&s;h di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The fault lies originally in the &s;tomach; and generally an irregular diet has been the cau&s;e: high &s;auces, bad wines, and &s;picy foods. The fir&s;t &s;tep to a cure is to ab&s;tain from the&s;e; and life depends upon it: for to aggravate tho&s;e &s;ymptoms is to de&s;troy the con&s;titution utterly: in|curable fevers, or fatal purgings follow.</P>
<P>The be&s;t beginning is by a vomit: and after this the diet mu&s;t be all of the mild and cooling kind. Every morning let the per&s;on take two &s;poonfuls of &s;yrup of &s;nails made by brui&s;ing them with &s;ugar, and hanging them up in a flannel bag till the juice runs out: and at meals, let the drink be a tea made of mar&s;hmallow and liquorice-root, with one third part milk, and drank ju&s;t warm. If the &s;kin grow yellow, or the white of the eyes
<PB N="43" REF="43">appear of that colour, a do&s;e of rhubarb once in three days will be needful. The be&s;t method of taking it is by chew|ing.</P>
<P>This is as much phy&s;ick as we would have the old man u&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e: the re&s;t mu&s;t be done by a proper regimen: let him regulate his pa&s;&s;ions: violent anger will increa&s;e this di&s;order more than the mo&s;t improper foods. Let him al&s;o ba|ni&s;h fear. If he thinks him&s;elf in dan|ger, he will bring on that danger.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t never overload his &s;tomach; nor ever &s;uffer it to be empty. Once in two hours he &s;hould &s;wallow &s;ome|thing Jellies of hart&s;horn, truly made, are excellent; but they mu&s;t be prepared at home: for cheating is &s;o ea&s;y, and the true method with hart&s;horn only is &s;o te|dious, that few who make them for &s;ale will do it hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>Often this complaint ri&s;es from a &s;top|page of per&s;piration in &s;ome part, particu|larly in the feet. Then the bu&s;ine&s;s is to bring it on again by additional warmth: as by flannel &s;ocks and yarn &s;tockings. This will in many ca&s;es alone perform the cure; and in all others, where &s;uch a &s;toppage
<PB N="44" REF="44">has been a part of the cau&s;e, it will a&s;&s;i&s;t the other methods.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e, which was at fir&s;t too quick, will grow moderate as the&s;e cautions take place, and this promi&s;es a cure. To com|pleat it, the patient mu&s;t go to bed in time, and u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e in the be&s;t hours of the day. He mu&s;t eat no fat meats, drink little wine, and avoid care and unea&s;ine&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>If he do not &s;leep well, he mu&s;t take a &s;mall do&s;e of &s;yrup of diacodium every night.</P>
<P>This method will re&s;tore him to health, and it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved with due care afterwards, el&s;e relap&s;es in this ca&s;e are frequent. A vomit once in &s;ix weeks, and a do&s;e of rhubarb every ten days, with a careful diet, will make this a very healthy con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The great care is taking the defect in time; for new di&s;orders are ea&s;ily con|quered, but e&s;tabli&s;hed ones are too ob|&s;tinate for &s;uch con&s;titutions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of pains and inflammations.</HEAD>
<P>IT is proper to treat of the&s;e together, becau&s;e they generally come together. We need not tell the old man where he is in pain: but he mu&s;t examine careful|ly whether there be inflammation with it.</P>
<P>This he will know by his pul&s;e beat|ing hard and quick, and by high coloured urine: his fle&s;h al&s;o will be hotter than u&s;ual. When pains come on without the&s;e &s;ymptoms, warmth in the part, and pa|tience are the remedies: they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the lot of age, and born ac|cordingly: but when the&s;e &s;ymptoms join with them they threaten dangerous con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep is bleeding: and this with ab&s;tinence from all hot foods often per|forms the cure.</P>
<P>If there be no relief, the next day but one a vomit will be proper. If the body be co&s;tive, it inflames all the &s;ymp|toms; and if purges be given, they in|crea&s;e the violent motion of the blood: and therefore do more hurt than &s;ervice. Cooling and oily gly&s;ters are the proper
<PB N="46" REF="46">method; and they &s;hould be repeated every morning.</P>
<P>The diet mu&s;t be light and cool: all &s;olid foods &s;hould be omitted for the fir&s;t four or five days, and in their place a&s;&s;es milk &s;hould be taken: and chicken broth and jellies mu&s;t be the nouri&s;hment dur|ing this period.</P>
<P>After this, as the di&s;order abates, the &s;trength mu&s;t be con&s;idered; and by de|grees the u&s;ual diet &s;uch is as here recom|mended for healthy old men may be in|troduced. But this mu&s;t be done gradu|ally, and with great caution; otherwi&s;e, a &s;udden change, from low to richer diet, will certainly bring on the complaint again; and wor&s;e inflammation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of fluxes.</HEAD>
<P>AGED people bear a too co&s;tive ha|bit much better than they do fluxes or purgings: for they are ea&s;ily weakened; and nothing does it more than the&s;e.</P>
<P>The great rule in old men's di&s;orders is to take them in time. This will be cured by proper diet when it is regarded early: otherwi&s;e medicines mu&s;t be called in, and perhaps they will be ineffectual.</P>
<P>The quantity of &s;olid food &s;hould be abated; but it &s;hould not be left off whol|ly. The drink &s;hould be made of burnt hart&s;horn and comfry root, two ounces of each boiled in two quarts of water to three pints, the liquor poured clear off, and drank warm with a little red wine.</P>
<P>Rice-milk, with &s;ome cinnamon boiled in it, is excellent for breakfa&s;t; and rice-pudding for &s;upper; two hours before bed|time. Sea-bi&s;cuit &s;hould be eat in&s;tead of bread, and the patient mu&s;t u&s;e more than ordinary exerci&s;e, to promote per&s;pira|tion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of the gravel and &s;tone.</HEAD>
<P>OLD per&s;ons are very &s;ubject to ob|&s;tructions in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; and the various degrees of the gravel and &s;tone follow. The&s;e are di&s;orders difficult of cure; but they are ea&s;ily prevented in mo&s;t con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to &s;light com|plaints of this kind avoid wine, and &s;up|ply its place by beer of a due &s;trength.</P>
<P>Let the diet be cooling: and in regard to exerci&s;e, the rule is moderation. Vio|lent motion, or re&s;t for a long time toge|ther, are equally wrong. Let the patient walk every day in the proper hours; and when the weather does not permit that, let him u&s;e the &s;ame exerci&s;e in his cham|ber.</P>
<P>When fits come on, let him take man|na and oil: this is an ea&s;y and effectual medicine. Two ounces of manna &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of water, and &s;ix &s;poonfuls of &s;allad oil added to it. A &s;poonful of this taken every half hour will &s;tay upon the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;wage pain, &s;top
<PB N="49" REF="49">the vomitings which often attend this complaint; and at the &s;ame time procure &s;tools: and while it ea&s;es the cholick pains will give pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tone.</P>
<P>This is the cour&s;e in the violence of a fit. When it is perceived coming on, an infu|&s;ion of BURDOCK ROOT &s;lic'd, is the be&s;t remedy. Two ounces of the fre&s;h root and a quart of boiling water poured on it makes this infu&s;ion. The liquor is to be &s;trained off as &s;oon as cold: and half a pint, a little warmed again, with a quarter of a pint of milk, and &s;weetened with honey, is to be taken every four hours.</P>
<P>This is the medicine lately publi&s;hed for the gout; and which many are now taking for that di&s;ea&s;e with great &s;ucce&s;s. The gout and gravel are nearly ally'd, and it is not &s;trange the &s;ame remedy is &s;o effectual al&s;o in this ca&s;e. The wonder is, that a plant of great virtue, and &s;o common, has been &s;o long neglect|ed by the practi&s;ers of phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Of the gout it would be vain to treat here. 'Tis a peculiar &s;ubject, and requires a larger compa&s;s than any &s;ingle article can be allowed in this work: and it has been con&s;idered &s;eparately in that treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of weakne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>OLD men mu&s;t expect a decay of &s;trength: and it would be as idle to call it a di&s;ea&s;e, as vain to think of re|medies. But, be&s;ides this which is natu|ral and nece&s;&s;ary, weakne&s;s is &s;ometimes accidental, and it may thus be remedied.</P>
<P>Great evacuations, inten&s;e &s;tudy, violent pa&s;&s;ions, or a too low diet will &s;ometimes bring it on before the natural time, and a proper care and regimen may remove it.</P>
<P>A lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e, feeblene&s;s of the limbs, a palene&s;s of the face, wa&s;te of fle&s;h, and low &s;pirits are the &s;ymptoms by which this is known; and the remedies are cordial medicines, and a &s;omewhat richer diet.</P>
<P>The medicine I have found mo&s;t effec|tual is this: a quarter of an ounce of &s;af|fron, a dram of cinnamon, and an ounce of confection alkermes in a quart of white wine: when this has &s;tood two days it &s;hould be poured off, and half a wine|gla&s;s of it drank once a day.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="51">
<P>Re&s;t of mind and body are al&s;o in this ca&s;e great articles toward the cure. Let not the patient think he is in danger: let him venture to eat &s;omewhat richer meats, but in a moderate quantity, and indulge in one extraordinary gla&s;s of wine at every meal.</P>
<P>Let him ri&s;e early; but not go out 'till the air is well warmed by the &s;un, and the dews are di&s;per&s;ed. If he re&s;ide in London at the time, let him immediately go into the country: if he be too loo&s;e in his bowels let him check it moderately by the means we have directed; and let his malt liquor be &s;trong of the hop.</P>
<P>Between breakfa&s;t and dinner let him every day take a yolk of a new laid egg beat up in a gla&s;s of &s;trong white wine. The company of agreeable friends will be the be&s;t medicine in an evening; and good broth his fitte&s;t &s;upper.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Of the a&s;thma.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a common complaint with aged per&s;ons; and there is none more trouble&s;ome. 'Tis difficult of cure: but relief is ea&s;y: and it will depend as much on the air as all other con&s;iderations together.</P>
<P>The great care in this re&s;pect is that the air of the place be neither thick nor damp.</P>
<P>The &s;moak of London is very bad; and the ill &s;mells from many of the trades carried on there is as hurtful. No per&s;on &s;ubject to an a&s;thma &s;hould live near tan|ners in the country, nor tallow chandlers, or the like offen&s;ive trades in London.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e at proper times is va&s;tly bene|ficial in this ca&s;e. Walking or riding be|fore dinner and &s;upper are particularly proper.</P>
<P>Frequent wa&s;hing the feet in warm water, with good rubing with dry cloaths afterwards, is al&s;o highly &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>All cold and vi&s;cous foods mu&s;t be avoided. The &s;tomach mu&s;t not be &s;uf|fered to be empty, nor mu&s;t it be loaded.
<PB N="53" REF="53">The food &s;hould be of the riche&s;t kind that is proper for per&s;ons advanced in years; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion two or three di&s;hes of good tea, made carefully and taken with little &s;ugar and without milk, &s;hould be drank con&s;tantly, two hours and a half after dinner.</P>
<P>Vegetables &s;hould be avoided, and one great caution &s;hould be not to drink too much of any liquor what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Bleeding is u&s;ually nece&s;&s;ary; and the condition of the blood will &s;hew whether it &s;hould be in larger or &s;maller quantity; and whether or not it will require to be &s;oon repeated.</P>
<P>If the blood be &s;izey the&s;e repeated bleedings will be nece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;ame condition of it &s;hews the body can &s;pare the&s;e quantities. It &s;hews al&s;o, that with|out the&s;e bleedings medicines can take no effect.</P>
<P>After this the greate&s;t pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t &s;harp or repeated fits is the famous gum ammoniacum. A quarter of an ounce of this being di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of water, two &s;poonfuls &s;hould be taken, according to the &s;ymptoms, every night, or every &s;econd or third night.</P>
<PB N="54" REF="54">
<P>This method will prevent many fits, and abate the &s;everity of tho&s;e which can|not be put off.</P>
<P>Thus the old man, even again&s;t the fury of this wor&s;t di&s;turbance of his life, and all the re&s;t, will live happy: and be ought to value that happine&s;s the more becau&s;e he will owe it to his own di&s;cretion.</P>
