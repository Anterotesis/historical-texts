<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Minehead, <DATE>Dec. 14. 1740.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE truly generous, noble, and indefatigable Spirit you have exerted on the Behalf of the Com|monwealth, during your &s;itting in Parliament, has drawn upon you the Trouble of this Application. You have &s;hewn, not only Inclination, but Ability to do real Service to your Country, by promoting and car|rying on &s;everal Bills, which will greatly contribute to the publick Good,
<PB N="4" REF="3">and tran&s;mit your Name with Ho|nour to Po&s;terity. You are a true Patriot, in the pure&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word; and, as &s;uch, I don't doubt, but you will think the following Pages highly worthy of your &s;erious Con|&s;ideration; and if you find any Hint in them fair, rea&s;onable, and cal|culated for the Intere&s;t of your Fel|low-&s;ubjects, you will gladly improve it, and readily concur in building upon it &s;uch an whol&s;ome Law as may redre&s;s the Grievance complained of. I think it will be ea&s;ily granted, that the Health of the Body is full as valuable as the Property of E&s;tates. How difficult would it be for any Per|&s;on to believe, that our Legi&s;lature is of that Opinion, who &s;hould ob&s;erve, that there are &s;o many good Laws en|acted by every Parliament for the De|fence
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the one, and &s;carce ever any Care taken of the Pre&s;ervation of the other? Indeed, within a long Series of Years, the Parliament has been mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ca&s;t an Eye towards the Health of the People, by an Act impowering Phy&s;icians to in|&s;pect Apothecaries Shops; by an Act for preventing the Retailing &s;pirituous Liquors; and by an Act for the Encouragement of the Publication of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Remedies. However, the&s;e In&s;tances, few as they are, prove, that the Honourable Hou&s;e does not think the Health of the Nation intirely below their Care and Con&s;i|deration; and therefore we ought to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Rea&s;on why Acts of Parliament for the like good Purpo&s;es are not more frequent, is, that the Hou&s;e is not applied to on &s;uch Sub|jects
<PB N="6" REF="5">in a proper manner; that the Grievances the People labour under are not fairly and plainly laid before the Members, or practical Methods of Redre&s;s are not pointed out.</P>
<P>The Health of a People can only be pre&s;erved by all the whol&s;ome Laws the Wi&s;dom of a Legi&s;lature can contrive, to prevent Luxury, De|bauchery, and every kind of Immora|lity, which infallibly produce Di&s;ea&s;es, or by frequent In&s;pections into the State of Phy&s;ick in their Country, be|cau&s;e Abu&s;es will daily creep into every Society, or Set of Men, who find them&s;elves under no Re&s;traint, from any Apprehen&s;ions of being called to an Account for their Method of treat|ing Mankind, in their mo&s;t moment|ous Concernments. Tho' the fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="6">Part of this general Plan is highly worth your Con&s;ideration, yet I &s;hall beg Leave to &s;ay a few Words to you in regard to the latter only.</P>
<P>The Reformation of the State of Phy&s;ick in general is greatly wanting in this Nation, and, I believe, mo&s;t warmly wi&s;hed by every hone&s;t Man, even of the Faculty it&s;elf. But tho' general Reformations may be as dif|ficult as they are de&s;ireable, yet &s;ome crying Enormities may them&s;elves point out the Method of their own Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the publick Hu|mour of the good People of <HI>England</HI> for the&s;e la&s;t Twenty Years, one &s;hould be apt to conclude, that certain odd Conjunctions of the heavenly Bodies
<PB N="8" REF="7">brought on epidemical Follies, as well as Di&s;ea&s;es. How have <HI>Shake&s;peare, John&s;on, Otway,</HI> and all the Plays capable of delighting the Mind, in|&s;tructing the Head, or mending the Heart, been totally neglected, or cold|ly received, while dear <HI>Harlequin!</HI> charming Devil! has filled all our Affections, triumphed over our Judg|ments, and emptied our Pockets! During an Aera like this, when &s;uch crowded Audiences, compo&s;ed of the great Vulgar and the &s;mall, gave &s;uch plain Demon&s;trations of their polite Ta&s;te, and profound Wi&s;dom, is it to be wonder'd, that there &s;hould appear, from the malign Influences of the &s;ame Stars, Marks of an epi|demical Madne&s;s in other Parts of the Town, as well as in the Theatre? No; Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> will have the Ho|nour
<PB N="9" REF="8">to be handed down to Po&s;terity as the illu&s;trious Contemporary of a <HI>Mapp,</HI> a <HI>Taylor,</HI> and a <HI>Ward.</HI> The Hi&s;torian of our Days will be able to inform his Readers, that the Infatu|ation was &s;o general, that <HI>Freind, Mead,</HI> and <HI>Pellet,</HI> were as much eclip&s;ed by this bright Con&s;tellation, as <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI> then was by a more happy Genius; a Gentleman, who, with &s;urprizing Activity, could turn him|&s;elf into all Shapes, and appear to be any Animal but what he really was. Such are the irre&s;i&s;tible Charms of Delu&s;ion! Such the Happine&s;s of be|ing deceived, that all our Applau&s;es ri&s;e in Proportion to the Artfulne&s;s of the Impo&s;ition, and the Difficulty of di&s;covering the Cheat!</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>Let Mrs. <HI>Mapp</HI>'s Bones re&s;t in Peace, tho' &s;he tortur'd &s;o many in the Days of her Fame.</P>
<P>Let the dexterous Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> be able to purge the vi&s;ual Ray of our neighbour Nations, that they may &s;ee their true Intere&s;t to con&s;i&s;t in treat|ing <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with Honour and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> is the only medicinal Meteor which yet continues to &s;hine among&s;t us, who&s;e Fame has rai&s;ed him to the highe&s;t Degree of E&s;teem and Admiration with the <HI>Gay</HI> and the <HI>Polite,</HI> on who&s;e Authority and Judgment Thou&s;ands, and Tens of Thou&s;ands, of the lower Part of Man|kind, &s;wallow his Medicines with im|plicit Faith, and are &s;aid thereby to
<PB N="11" REF="10">receive mo&s;t wonderful Cures, in al|mo&s;t incurable Di&s;tempers. The In|fluence of this Gentleman's Reputa|tion being now become &s;o very exten|&s;ive, his Manner of practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick cannot be thought a Subject unwor|thy the Notice and Con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature. I am &s;ure, Sir, you will afford it your Attention, for a few Minutes, as it is of Importance to the Service of the Publick, to which I well know how much every Mo|ment of your Time is dedicated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall by no means take upon me to determine, whether the numberle&s;s Deaths laid to this Gentleman's Charge by his Oppo&s;ers, or the unparallel'd Cures he is &s;aid to have performed by his Admirers, come neare&s;t the Truth. What he owns him&s;elf, and what all
<PB N="12" REF="11">his Friends allow, may, I hope, be taken for granted. He confe&s;&s;es, with great Candour, that he is wholly ig|norant of the Hi&s;tory and Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es; that he under&s;tands nothing of Anatomy, or the animal Oecono|my; and that he only pretends to &s;ome Knowledge in Chymi&s;try, by which Art he has di&s;covered a few Medicines, of greater Efficacy in parti|cular Ca&s;es, than tho&s;e in common U&s;e among regular Phy&s;icians. Suppo&s;e then, that what this Gentleman a&s;&s;erts is true, and that he has &s;uch powerful chymical Secrets in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; mu&s;t they not be capable of doing as much Harm, when ignorantly and promi&s;cuou&s;ly admini&s;tered, as they would be of doing Good in the Hands of a Per&s;on duly qualified to know in what Ca&s;es, how, and when, properly
<PB N="13" REF="12">to apply them? Will that noble chri|&s;tian Charity, which from this Gentle|man's <HI>known moral Character</HI> cannot but be believed to be the &s;ole Motive of his great Bounty to the Crowds of poor People who daily attend him, make amends for his dealing out the&s;e powerful Medicines &s;o indi&s;criminate|ly to all who &s;hall pay him the Com|pliment of being willing to &s;wallow them? Do the Multitude of Patients whom he never &s;aw before, or will &s;ee afterwards, want no Attendance during the violent Operation of their Phy&s;ick? No Per&s;on acquainted with the Nature of their Medicines, to re|lieve or correct any Accidents, which &s;o often attend the mo&s;t common and gentle Remedies? Surely it mu&s;t ap|pear, to every unprejudiced Per&s;on, that the mo&s;t u&s;eful Drugs, under
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;uch Management, mu&s;t be a &s;ore Evil, and therefore that nothing can be more uncharitable, than thus to de|ceive and hurt a Multitude under the &s;pecious Pretence of Charity? But however faulty this Gentleman's Me|thod of Practice may be, yet his Me|dicines may in them&s;elves, and under proper Direction, be extremely valuable. Let us grant, that they are &s;o; Is it not then incumbent on tho&s;e who have the Good of the People at Heart, to endeavour to render the&s;e valuable Secrets a publick Benefit, which, un|der their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, are &s;o great a Calamity? Every Man ought to be rewarded for his Di&s;covery of any thing that may be beneficial to Society. Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> &s;hould not be de&s;ired to part with his Property (and his No&s;trums are undoubtedly
<PB N="15" REF="14">&s;uch) without a rea&s;onable Equivalent. The Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is able to grant him this Equivalent, and they have a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>demand</HI> the Knowledge of his Secrets on ju&s;t and equitable Terms. An <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a Piece of Ground which interrupts the making a River navi|gable, is <HI>obliged</HI> to part with his Pro|perty for the Good of the Commu|nity: Surely Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Property in his Secrets is not more inviolable, than what every Man has in his own Land; and therefore it cannot be looked upon as any Hard&s;hip, if he &s;hould be forced to part with them on like Conditions. Should &s;uch a Demand be made upon him by Parliament; &s;hould the Reward appointed be ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ainable only by the Proof, before competent Judges, of his Medicines,
<PB N="16" REF="15">when divulged, performing the &s;ame Cures on fair Subjects, which they are now &s;aid to do on his private Pa|tients; and &s;hould he refu&s;e to &s;tand that only Te&s;t, what could be con|cluded from &s;uch a Refu&s;al, but that he did not believe in his own Con|&s;cience, that they would perform what he and his Friends do now per|&s;uade the World to believe that they will do? Would not &s;uch a Refu&s;al be a ju&s;t and equitable Ground for the Parliament to forbid his farther dealing out the&s;e Medicines, (of which they would have Rea&s;on to believe that he had him&s;elf no Opinion) and by a whol&s;ome Law, to prevent hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Maje&s;ty's Subjects from being any longer cheated of their Money, if no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> robb'd of their Lives. But as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gentleman's great Cures are &s;o wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="17" REF="16">atte&s;ted by many Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion, who&s;e Knowledge in &s;uch Matters cannot be di&s;puted, I have no Rea&s;on to fear, that he would at all &s;u&s;pect the Efficacy of his Medicines, in all the de&s;perate Ca&s;es, which he now &s;o confidently undertakes. He will there|fore undoubtedly &s;ubmit them to an impartial Trial with the greate&s;t Chearfulne&s;s, e&s;pecially as he will, over and above the Reward appointed by Parliament, be &s;ure of gratifying his mo&s;t charitable Di&s;po&s;ition in the Satisfaction of knowing, that, whereas before only &s;ome Thou&s;ands of his Countrymen enjoyed the Fruits of his Labours, then he will become a ge|neral Good to Mankind. The ho|nourable Gentlemen who now talk of his Medicines as divine, and of his Cures as little le&s;s than miraculous,
<PB N="18" REF="17">will all mo&s;t heartily join in promoting this Publication; they will congratu|late their Country on the ine&s;timable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Secrets, which, but for the Care of our Legi&s;lature, might have &s;lept in the &s;ingle Brea&s;t of their Author, and have been buried with him in Oblivion, to the irreparable Lo&s;s of all future Ages!</P>
<P>As the Number of Inhabitants is the Riches of a Nation, while &s;o many brave Men are lo&s;ing their Lives abroad in the Service of their Coun|try, let us not &s;uffer tho&s;e who remain at home to be daily thinned, either by the improper Application of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Medicines, under his pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration of them, or for want of their being made more univer&s;ally u&s;eful by a &s;peedy Publication.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>The Gin Act is a glorious In&s;tance of the tender Care of our Parliament for the Lives and Healths of our Peo|ple, to whom that pernicious Liquor was promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and &s;ometimes <HI>charitably,</HI> retailed, by &s;uch who pre|ferred their own wicked Gains to the Welfare of all human Creatures.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Act is a plain Proof of the true Sen&s;e your honourable Hou&s;e has of the great Benefit of making any u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in Phy|&s;ick; and it is likewi&s;e a proper Pre|cedent of the Manner in which &s;uch Publications &s;hould be made, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">he Te&s;ts and Trials &s;uch di&s;covered Medicines mu&s;t undergo in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ntitle their Authors to their due Re|ward.

If his Medicines will per|form the Cures openly and fairly, which are now attributed to them, I think the Parliament cannot pay too much for the Knowledge of them, or Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> receive too great Honours from a grateful People. But &s;hould this Gen|tleman be &s;o blind to his own Intere&s;t as to refu&s;e to become this publick Ble&s;&s;ing, on any Terms, can he expect to enjoy the warm Affections of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> Countrymen, to whom he will appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o charitable, and &s;o hard-hearted, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame time?

<P>But to You, Sir, I humbly &s;ubmit the Con&s;ideration of this <HI>important</HI> Point; I call it <HI>important;</HI> and what concerns the Lives of &s;o many of the Innocent, and the Ignorant, de&s;erves to be &s;o called. I &s;peak as a Friend to Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> as well as to my Country. I propo&s;e a Method, by which, in&s;tead of being the Idol of a Few, he &s;hall become the Darling of a whole People! by which he &s;hall remove that huge Load of Scandal, which now lies upon him, to the great Chagrin of his Enemies, who &s;hall pine with Envy at the Brightne&s;s of his Glory. The black Li&s;t of his private Murders, which is now maliciou&s;ly handed about by Phy&s;icians, and their Emi&s;&s;aries,
<PB N="22" REF="21">&s;hall whiten into a pompous Regi&s;ter of publick Cures, performed by his Medicines, on the mi&s;erable Objects, who had been delivered over to the iron Jaws of Death, by the Ignorance or Indolence of tho&s;e Doctors, fal&s;ely &s;o called, who have had no Oppor|tunity of under&s;tanding Phy&s;ick, but their having been bred to the Profe&s;|&s;ion. By this means this worthy Gen|tleman &s;hall be freed from that La|bour and Toil with which he now &s;erves his Country in his private Ca|pacity. He &s;hall do even more Good, and yet, as is mo&s;t meet and fit, he &s;hall be able to retire from the World, full of Days and Honours; he &s;hall &s;pend the few la&s;t Years he has to come in Dignity and Ea&s;e, enjoying the calm Evening of a well-&s;pent Life, conver&s;ing with Nature in the mo&s;t endearing Inti|macy,
<PB N="23" REF="22">to which he has arrived by tor|turing her ten thou&s;and Ways, till he made her confe&s;s tho&s;e very Secrets, which he has now communicated for the publick Good, and which &s;hall draw down Ble&s;&s;ings on him, and his Po&s;terity, through all future Ages.</P>
<P>I beg therefore, Sir, for my Sake, as your Fellow-Citizen; for Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Sake, who can do us all &s;o much Service; and for your Country's Sake, who&s;e Intere&s;t you have &s;o &s;in|cerely and warmly at Heart, that you will think &s;eriou&s;ly on this Matter.
