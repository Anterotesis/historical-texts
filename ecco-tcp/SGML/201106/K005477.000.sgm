<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my &s;ole motive for becoming a member of this &s;ociety was the plea&s;ure I always derived from the enlightended con|ver&s;ation of gentlemen of the Medical Profe&s;&s;ion, and as I have hitherto attended to the &s;cience only as a matter of en|tertaining curio&s;ity, and not as a pur&s;uit to which I have any pre&s;ent intention of devoting my&s;elf, I might, perhaps, with|out encountering the cen&s;ure of the candid and con&s;iderate, have endeavoured to excu&s;e my&s;elf from the execution of a talk to which the nature of my pur&s;uits mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily render me &s;o inadequate. But, as I am no friend to privileges, and would have every member of &s;ociety endure his proportion of the public burthens; and as, above all, I would wi&s;h to ex|clude the idle drone from the hive of &s;cience, I felt my&s;elf cal|led upon to perform the part allotted by our in&s;titutions, and
<PB N="2" REF="6">to give every gentleman that opportunity of canva&s;&s;ing and controverting my opinions, which, with re&s;pect to theirs, I have occa&s;ionally exerci&s;ed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have di&s;carded, therefore, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the timidity naturally attendant upon the many di&s;advantages under which I labour, and launching into a new and untried region, have brought my little tribute of phy&s;ical <HI>knowledge,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;pe|culation,</HI> to the general fund; confident only in the hope, that the &s;mallne&s;s of its value will in &s;ome degree be compen&s;ated by the cheerfulne&s;s with which it is contributed.</P>
<P>My <HI>Theory</HI> will no doubt be found, in many re&s;pects, defec|tive, from the want of more general information in the &s;ciences of Anatomy and Phy&s;iology; and may, perhaps, be erroneous in others, from the mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of &s;cattered facts, im|perfectly collected, without the concatenation of circum&s;tances by which they might be elucidated and explained. But &s;uch as it is, I am &s;ure the &s;ociety would pardon its imperfections, if they knew the numerous avocations among which it has been dige&s;ted, and the &s;mall proportion of time I have been enabled to devote to its compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I make the&s;e ob&s;ervations, not to abate the ardour of con|trover&s;y, or re&s;train the keenne&s;s of inve&s;tigation. It is from that <HI>ardour,</HI> from that <HI>keenne&s;s,</HI> and not from any vague con|jectures
<PB N="3" REF="7">in this e&s;&s;ay, that edification is to be expected by the &s;ociety; and &s;o far am I from wi&s;hing to &s;helter my hypo|the&s;is behind the &s;creen of any per&s;onal con&s;ideration, that I &s;hould neither be di&s;plea&s;ed at being convinced that I am wrong, nor backward in acknowledging my conviction. Re|putation is not to be expected from &s;o tran&s;ient an attention as I have been enabled to pay to this &s;ubject; nor can there be any di&s;grace in the failure of an attempt, which is the re|&s;ult rather of nece&s;&s;ity than of choice.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>candour of judgment,</HI> and not <HI>indulgence in inve&s;|tigation,</HI> is what I &s;olicit from the &s;ociety; and for that I &s;hall not &s;olicit in vain.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, however, before I proceed to my &s;ubject, to premi&s;e one remark. I do not here profe&s;s to delineate a perfect &s;y&s;tem. I have entitled my paper an E&s;&s;ay, and as &s;uch only I wi&s;h it to be con&s;idered. I &s;hall not therefore be expected to demon&s;trate every propo&s;ition, or to draw out every part of my theory with amplitude and per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>This, I believe, is what has never yet been done; nor, from the limits of our pre&s;ent knowledge, can it rationally be ex|pected of any hypothe&s;is upon this &s;ubject. The Anato|mical Phy&s;iologi&s;t him&s;elf is frequently left to wander in the regions of conjecture. The functions of almo&s;t every organ
<PB N="4" REF="8">may be traced farther than the exi&s;tence of &s;uch organs can be detected by the minute&s;t enquiry: Analogy, therefore, is often called upon to &s;upply the place of Demon&s;tration; or the more ea&s;y expedient is appealed to, of pa&s;&s;ing over in &s;ilence what cannot be readily accounted for. Many of the conjectures, it is true, which the imperfection of the &s;en&s;es, or the deficiency of ob&s;ervation, has rendered nece&s;&s;ary to pro|fe&s;&s;ors, have gathered confidence from the great authorities by which they have been &s;anctioned: yet let it not be forgotten, that it is not in the nature of authorities to change conjectures into proofs. Let us remember al&s;o, that <HI>rea&s;on is the greate&s;t authority of all;</HI> and that when &s;y&s;tems cla&s;h, and demon|&s;trations are not to be had, we ought not to con&s;ider who is the author of this, or who of that opinion, but which it is that involves the fewe&s;t ab&s;urdities, or is be&s;t &s;upported by analogy, and the corre&s;pondence of the general laws of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY, TOWARDS A DEFINITION OF ANIMAL VITALITY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an apparent paradox, but it is not therefore the le&s;s true, that tho&s;e ideas, or phenomena, that are mo&s;t fami|liar to us, &s;hould frequently be the mo&s;t difficult to explain. This is particularly the ca&s;e with the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>Life is a <HI>term</HI> &s;o con&s;tantly recurring, and, indeed, as one would at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, an <HI>image</HI> &s;o perpetually pre&s;enting it&s;elf to our &s;en&s;es&mdash;and the difference is &s;o &s;triking, between the pale in&s;en&s;ate corp&s;e, and a living being, with all the expre&s;&s;ions, actions, and attributes with which, in the higher &s;cale of animals, he generally offers him&s;elf to our
<PB N="6" REF="10">eyes, or our imaginations, that a vulgar ob&s;erver would &s;neer at the philo&s;opher who &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t the difficulty of a&s;certain|ing in what vitality con&s;i&s;ts: yet where is the &s;tudent, who, upon &s;erious examination, has found him&s;elf &s;atisfied with any thing that has been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject?</P>
<P>Does not the greate&s;t anatomical philo&s;opher, even of the pre&s;ent enlightened age, tacitly confe&s;s the confu&s;ion of his ideas in this re&s;pect, when he declares that, <Q>"From an exa|mination and &s;urvey of <HI>animal matter when dead,</HI> only we gain an idea of <HI>living animal matter;"</HI></Q> and that <Q>"as from <HI>life</HI> only we gain an idea of <HI>death,</HI> &s;o from death only we gain an idea of <HI>life?"</HI></Q></P>
<P>Before we can po&s;&s;ibly derive any &s;ort of information from this antithe&s;is, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be in&s;tructed how life and death may be accurately di&s;criminated; for how are we to make compari&s;ons between objects which we are unable to &s;eparate from each other? But even this has never &s;ucce&s;sfully been attempted; for though there are certain &s;igns (as putrefaction, &amp;c.) by which the death of the animal may be demon&s;trated; yet, as it is not even pre|tended that putrefaction is the <HI>act of vital di&s;&s;olution,</HI>&mdash;or, in other words, that the body which is not putrid is nece&s;&s;arily alive&mdash;death mu&s;t have taken place, independently of any &s;uch change; and we are, therefore, ju&s;t as much in the
<PB N="7" REF="11">dark as ever with re&s;pect to the ultimate te&s;t by which the <HI>pre&s;ence of life</HI> may be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>Treati&s;e after treati&s;e has been written on the Vital Prin|ciple; theory has pulled down theory without end; and the gro&s;s contradictions which have marked the opinions of the greate&s;t characters upon the &s;ubject, might induce one to think that, even with re&s;pect to the <HI>general idea,</HI> we are &s;till entirely at a lo&s;s; that we are &s;eeking for an <HI>imaginary &s;ome|thing</HI>&mdash;a phantom of the brain, which, perhaps, has no real exi&s;tence: and, indeed, if the <HI>term</HI> is to be literally under|&s;tood&mdash;if this Vital Principle is to be con&s;idered as a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> or <HI>independent e&s;&s;ence,</HI> &s;eparable from the effects and actions by which the <HI>&s;tate of vitality</HI> is to be a&s;certained, I am not &s;ure that this conclu&s;ion will be found to involve as much ab&s;urdity as is included in the contrary opinion.</P>
<P>I am well aware that there are &s;ome, who, from the fir&s;t blu&s;h of this ob&s;ervation, may be inclined to &s;mile, and con|&s;ider it as the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of &s;ceptici&s;m: but the philo&s;o|pher will do well to keep the di&s;tinction between <HI>a vital principle,</HI> and <HI>the &s;tate of vitality,</HI> con&s;tantly in his mind: the former properly meaning a <HI>living</HI> CAUSE&mdash;the latter &s;imply a <HI>modification</HI> or <HI>effect,</HI> to which the <HI>name of life</HI> is given, and which may be <HI>the re&s;ult of a co-operation of other cau&s;es,</HI> neither
<PB N="8" REF="12">of which need, in them&s;elves, of nece&s;&s;ity be alive.&mdash;In other words, to contend for the exi&s;tence of a <HI>Vital Principle,</HI> is to contend that there is &s;uperadded to organized matter a di&s;tinct &s;omething, in it&s;elf alive, by which the vital functions are carried on; while, on the other hand, the <HI>State of Vitality</HI> need not of nece&s;&s;ity be con&s;trued, as mean|ing any thing more than the condition of the animal body during the continuance of tho&s;e functions.</P>
<P>Now&mdash;that there is a &s;tate of animal exi&s;tence, that may properly be called the <HI>State of Life,</HI> and be put in direct contradi&s;tinction to that of <HI>Death,</HI> and that upon the previous induction of this &s;tate depend all the higher functions of the &s;en&s;itive being, are certainly among the mo&s;t &s;elf-evident of all &s;imple propo&s;itions. Nor is it le&s;s certain, that there mu&s;t be an exact and preci&s;e moment (nay, <HI>fraction,</HI> or, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, <HI>mathematical point</HI> of a moment), in which this <HI>&s;tate of life cea&s;es,</HI> and that of death begins; though whe|ther that moment can ever be a&s;certained by any &s;en&s;ible and po&s;itive mark of di&s;crimination, is matter of con&s;iderable doubt: but if this <HI>Vitality</HI> is to be con&s;idered, <HI>ab origine,</HI> as a <HI>Principle,</HI> (by which, <HI>phy&s;ically</HI> or <HI>philo&s;ophically</HI> &s;peaking, I conceive is always to be under&s;tood, <HI>a &s;imple, elementary, and fir&s;t natural cau&s;e</HI>), and not, as it&s;elf, an effect of the co-ope|ration of other principles, or <HI>natural</HI> and pre-exi&s;ting cau&s;es,
<PB N="9" REF="13">I own, for my own part, I mu&s;t be rather &s;low in yielding my a&s;&s;ent; and, while I bow with re&s;pect to &s;uperior judg|ments, mu&s;t claim the prerogative of exerci&s;ing my own.</P>
<P>Egypt, Greece and Rome are, it is true, again&s;t me:&mdash;the ancients and the moderns&mdash;Ari&s;totle and Plato, Plutarch, Mo&s;es, and John Hunter; and yet again&s;t this ho&s;t of Giants I pre&s;ume to lift my pigmy lance, and brave the unequal combat.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient of the opinions tran&s;mitted to us upon this &s;ubject, I believe, is that of the Egyptians, which con|&s;iders the <HI>Soul</HI> (or <HI>living Principle</HI>) as a kind of <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> or <HI>aerial &s;ub&s;tance,</HI> diffu&s;ed through every part of the body, animating every limb, and partaking of all its proportions.</P>
<P>Man, according to them, con&s;i&s;ts of three parts&mdash;a <HI>gro&s;s peri&s;hable body</HI>&mdash;an <HI>intellectual principle,</HI> or <HI>intelligent mind,</HI> by which he is elevated above the brute creation&mdash;and an <HI>image,</HI> or <HI>&s;oul,</HI> exactly re&s;embling the body in &s;hape, in magnitude and feature, upon which animation, and all the functions of the animal frame depend; and in which, al&s;o, they conceive the intellectual principle to be en&s;hrined.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<P>That the&s;e were con&s;idered, in the proper meaning of the word, as <HI>di&s;tinct principles,</HI> is evident, &s;ince they are treated as being capable of independent exi&s;tence&mdash;the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> or <HI>vital principle,</HI> continuing many of its functions after its &s;epara|tion from the body; and the <HI>mind,</HI> or <HI>intellectual power,</HI> after the final &s;eparation, being &s;ometimes con&s;igned to a different re&s;idence from the <HI>&s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>This opinion (which &s;till, with &s;ome &s;light variations, con|tinues to be popular among Divines and Morali&s;ts, and has been mangled and metamorpho&s;ed even by our philo&s;ophers them&s;elves) was adopted by the Greeks, was infu&s;ed into the &s;ubtile and intricate philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle, dilated upon by the divine genius of Plato, beautified by the &s;ublime inven|tion of that mo&s;t ancient of their poets and philo&s;ophers, the immortal Homer; and, at length, was taught by Plutarch to the Roman World, in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>"Man,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>"is a compound &s;ubject, but not of two parts, as is commonly believed, becau&s;e the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> is generally accounted a part of the <HI>&s;oul;</HI> whereas <HI>it</HI> as far exceeds the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> as the <HI>&s;oul</HI> is diviner than the <HI>body.</HI> Now the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> when <HI>compounded</HI> with the <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> makes REASON, and, when <HI>compounded</HI> with the <HI>body,</HI> makes PASSION; whereof one is the &s;ource or principle of
<PB N="11" REF="15">plea&s;ure or pain&mdash;the other of vice or virtue. Man, therefore, properly dies two deaths; the fir&s;t makes him two of three, and the &s;econd makes him one of two."</Q></P>
<P>This hypothe&s;is has certainly beauty and ingenuity to re|commend it to our imaginations; and is al&s;o, to my concep|tions at lea&s;t, &s;omewhat more comprehen&s;ible than tho&s;e &s;y&s;|tems which refer the operations of gro&s;s matter to immaterial agency. It is, however, like all the &s;peculations of the an|cients upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, unfounded in experimental en|quiry, and un&s;upported by facts or ob&s;ervation: yet St. Paul, (who derived much of his in&s;piration from the ancient poets and philo&s;ophers) has given it the &s;anction of his authority, by dividing, in di&s;tinct terms, the <HI>triune</HI> man into Body, Soul, and Spirit.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, it is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing that modern philo&s;ophy &s;hould have been more anxious to frame &s;uch &s;y&s;|tems as were reconcileable with this tripartite divi&s;ion, than &s;uch as might be con&s;i&s;tent with known facts, or maintain|able on the grounds of rea&s;on; and that we &s;hould accord|ingly find this theory &s;o &s;toutly defended to the pre&s;ent hour, with the &s;light alteration only of tran&s;po&s;ing the <HI>&s;oul</HI> into the place of <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>Vital Principle</HI> in the place of <HI>&s;oul.</HI> Some philo&s;ophers, however, by con&s;idering
<PB N="12" REF="16">the <HI>immaterial e&s;&s;ence</HI> as the animating principle, and others, by con&s;idering the <HI>animating principle</HI> as the only medium of intelligence, have reduced human exi&s;tence to a two-fold nature: I, for my part, &s;hall &s;implify the &s;ubject &s;till far|ther&mdash;and, regarding man as differing from other animals rather in the extent than in the nature of his powers, &s;hall con&s;ider him, together with the inferior tenants of creation, in an individual point of view only; as con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;im|ple organized frame, from the &s;u&s;ceptibility and pre&s;ence, or the non-&s;u&s;ceptibility, or ab&s;ence of &s;timuli in which ari&s;es the whole di&s;tinction between the <HI>living</HI> body and the <HI>dead.</HI> Wherever there is a perfect organization of the animal &s;ub|&s;tance, there, I conceive, we have the <HI>&s;u&s;ceptibility</HI> (or, as it may, perhaps not improperly, be called, the PRE-DISPOSING CAUSE) of Life: whatever may be that &s;pecific &s;timulus, by which &s;uch &s;u&s;ceptibility may be di&s;po&s;ed to be excited, that, I conceive, mu&s;t be admitted to be the REMOTE CAUSE, or agent by which Life is to be produced: from the intimate combination of the&s;e re&s;ults, that meliorated or altered &s;tate of the organized frame, which may be con&s;idered as the PROXIMATE CAUSE; and the Vital Action, as it may pro|perly be called, or the power by which the vital functions are performed, being the ultimate effect of the&s;e co-operat|ing cau&s;es, is, in reality, as I humbly pre&s;ume, to be con&s;i|dered as that Life, or Animal Vitality, for which, under &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="17">many denominations and imaginary forms, the Philo&s;opher and the Medical Profe&s;&s;or have &s;o long been &s;eeking.</P>
<P>Such is the general idea, which, upon the &s;imple princi|ples of materiali&s;m, I have formed of life; and &s;o to define this idea as to account for the phenomena, without appealing to the fanciful creations of the vi&s;ionary brain, or ab&s;tru&s;e and unmeaning terms of pretended &s;cience, is the ta&s;k I have undertaken.</P>
<P>But before I enter more particularly into the &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow &s;ome con&s;ideration on another theory that has lately very much amu&s;ed, and, according to my judgment, mi&s;led the &s;cientific world&mdash;The theory, I mean, of the Vital Principle being re&s;ident in the blood.</P>
<P>This doctrine, in all probability, had its origin in the re|mote&s;t antiquity; &s;ince the fatal con&s;equences that re&s;ult to the animal frame, from the &s;pilling of this important fluid, mu&s;t have been frequently ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially in the ages of bar|bari&s;m and violence, long before the faculties of man were &s;ufficiently improved for refined &s;peculations, or philo&s;ophi|cal re&s;earches into nature: but the prejudices of ignorance have <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> been <HI>a&s;certained,</HI> and <HI>more frequently adopted,</HI> by the luminaries of &s;cience and the world; and this ha&s;ty opi|nion
<PB N="14" REF="18">(for &s;uch to me at lea&s;t it appears) has not wanted &s;up|porters among tho&s;e who will long continue to claim the ap|plau&s;e and admiration of mankind.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I mu&s;t particularize, that this doctrine has re|ceived the direct &s;anction of the great Jewi&s;h Law-giver (or whoever was the author of the Five Books of Sacred Hi&s;tory generally a&s;cribed to him) in the following, among a variety of texts of a &s;imilar nature&mdash;<Q><HI>"For it is the life of all fle&s;h; the blood of it is the life thereof: therefore I &s;aid unto the children of I&s;rael, Ye &s;hall eat of the blood of no manner of fle&s;h: for the life of all fle&s;h is the blood thereof; who&s;oever eateth it &s;hall be cut off."</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am very well aware, that the &s;ublime language of Reve|lation is not always to be interpreted with philo&s;ophical pre|ci&s;ion&mdash;the enthu&s;ia&s;m of divine in&s;piration frequently elevat|ing the &s;tyle of the holy penman to a degree of poetical hyperbole, which would be perfectly unintelligible to the cold perceptions of rea&s;on and enquiry, if it were not for the friendly appeals of the commentator to my&s;tical allegory, and metaphorical elucidation: but as the doctrine here quoted is merely illu&s;trative of the &s;imple mandate, that the Jews &s;hould not eat of the blood of animals &s;lain for their &s;u&s;tenance, there can be no doubt of its being intended to be literally
<PB N="15" REF="19">under&s;tood as the opinion of Mo&s;es, that the blood is ab&s;o|lutely the Vital Principle.</P>
<P>For this opinion, I am very much inclined to &s;u&s;pect, that no better foundation will be di&s;covered than the acknow|ledged fact, that when the blood, or any very con&s;iderable portion of it, is drawn away, the vital functions of the ani|mal will cea&s;e: but, unfortunately for this theory, the&s;e functions will al&s;o cea&s;e, without the proportion of this fluid being at all dimini&s;hed: and as there are al&s;o &s;everal other parts entering into the compo&s;ition of the animal, which, if &s;ubtracted, even in part, re&s;ign the body to inevitable de|&s;truction, we might as well &s;ay, that the &s;tomach thereof, or the kidneys, or the liver thereof, <HI>is the life thereof,</HI> as that the blood is to be &s;o con&s;idered. Nay, from what we are now ac|quainted with concerning the nervous &s;y&s;tem, there would be much better rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, with &s;ome later philo&s;ophers, that the life of the animal is in the <HI>brain,</HI> rather than in the <HI>blood,</HI> &s;ince &s;o much of the latter may be lo&s;t without e&s;&s;ential injury, while the former cannot receive the &s;lighte&s;t wound without bringing on immediate di&s;&s;olution; and though, upon &s;erious reflection, there is every rea&s;on to believe, that the fatal cata&s;trophe is produced as much, at lea&s;t, by the con&s;equent extrava&s;ation of the blood, as by any imme|diate &s;u&s;ceptibility of injury in the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain;
<PB N="16" REF="20">yet this does not weaken the argument, &s;ince it is evident, that it is not the lo&s;s of blood from the ve&s;&s;els which is the real cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief (for much larger quantities may be drawn from the &s;ame part by mere external wounds, without any alarming con&s;equences); but that the injury produced by the extrava&s;ation re&s;ults from the con&s;equent oppre&s;&s;ion on the organ, by which its active energy is re|&s;trained and benumbed, and, of cour&s;e, its vital functions will be &s;topped.</P>
<P>From this, and a variety of other con&s;iderations, it is evi|dent that the brain is, at lea&s;t, more vital than the blood, &s;ince the compre&s;&s;ion of the former is more dangerous than even a very con&s;iderable deduction of the latter.</P>
<P>But it might, perhaps, be objected to the whole of this rea&s;oning, that many animals have life, which have neither brain, nor kidneys, nor liver, nor, &s;trictly &s;peaking, even &s;to|machs; for I know not how the &s;imple cavities of the <HI>leech</HI> or <HI>polipus</HI> can, in &s;trict propriety, be con&s;idered as &s;to|machs.</P>
<P>This objection being founded in truth, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould give it its utmo&s;t force, and admit it as a demon|&s;tration, that animal life neither con&s;i&s;ts in, nor is ab&s;olutely
<PB N="17" REF="21">dependant upon any one of the&s;e particular organs: but as it will be admitted, that though they have not the&s;e, they have &s;ome other organs, which, as far as is nece&s;&s;ary for the performance of their functions, &s;upply the place of the&s;e, the ca&s;es will &s;till be found to be in &s;ome degree parallel&mdash;for, &s;trictly &s;peaking, many of the mo&s;t imperfect animals have no blood (at lea&s;t, according to the general idea which is given of it in the de&s;criptions of anatomi&s;ts), there being, perhaps, as much difference between the ichor, which &s;upplies its place in &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of in&s;ects and reptiles, and the com|pound fluid, which, in the more perfect animals, we call by the name of blood, as between this ichor and the &s;ap of vege|tables, and a variety of other &s;imple juices of animal or ve|getable &s;ub&s;tances. If, therefore, the <HI>Vital Principle</HI> is to be &s;ought in the circulating fluids, we ought rather to &s;ay, that <HI>the</HI> SERUM <HI>thereof is the life thereof,</HI> than the BLOOD.</P>
<P>But as I am informed, that the immortal Harvey upheld a doctrine &s;imilar to that I am combating; and as &s;o great an authority as John Hunter has thought proper, in &s;ome de|gree, to &s;anction the opinion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to treat it more at large, and to abandon the cur&s;ory ob&s;ervation of the Jewi&s;h Law-giver, for the more elaborate and practical re&s;earches of the Briti&s;h Anatomical Philo&s;opher.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="23">
<P>Now, whether all or any, either of the particular fluid or &s;olid parts,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I treat the word parts here, not as alluding to limbs or proportions, but as referring to the &s;eparate and different &s;pecies of &s;ub&s;tance of which the body is con&s;tituted&mdash;as bone in contradi&s;tinction to mu&s;cle, mu&s;cle in contradi&s;tinction to nerve, nerve to membrane, and the like.</NOTE> po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>in them&s;elves</HI> (that is to &s;ay, either &s;e|parately, or ab&s;olutely) a principle of life, I do not at pre&s;ent enquire, becau&s;e it &s;eems to involve the general que&s;tion, (which mu&s;t be referred to its proper place in my E&s;&s;ay); namely&mdash;Whether life it&s;elf is to be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct and po&s;itive e&s;&s;ence, or, &s;imply, as the re&s;ult of a particular harmony and corre&s;pondence of the whole, or aggregate combination, pre&s;erved and acted upon by a particular &s;timulus? On this &s;ubject, indeed, it is &s;ufficiently evident that I have the misfortune to differ from the illu&s;trious authority before me; but as I am now examining the doc|trine only of the Vitality of the Blood, it is but nece&s;&s;ary for me ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that as nothing more is directly a&s;&s;erted in the propo&s;ition, than that the blood of the living body is <HI>equally</HI> alive with the bones and ligaments, and mu&s;cular fibres, &amp;c. of which &s;uch living body is compo&s;ed, it does not &s;eem to lie con&s;iderably in the way of my theory; be|cau&s;e, if in other re&s;pects I can but &s;ub&s;tantiate my opinion, the difference will not be very great, whether we admit the <HI>blood</HI> as participating in the Vitality, produced as I &s;hall en|deavour

Nay, when he afterwards proceeds to a&s;&s;ert, that <Q>"Blood is not only alive it&s;elf, but al&s;o, by circula|tion through every part of the body, becomes <HI>the means of,</HI> and <HI>carries Life</HI> to, the other parts;"</Q> I do not yet perceive the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of entering the li&s;ts upon this part of the &s;ubject, becau&s;e he does not palpably a&s;&s;ert, that the Life to be conveyed is, <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> or originally <HI>in the blood;</HI> but only that this fluid is the agent by which the Vitality is communicated to the re&s;pective parts; and it is my intention to admit that the blood, in the <HI>more perfect,</HI> and the &s;erous fluid, &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, in the <HI>le&s;s perfect</HI> animals, is the appropriate medium, by which alone the &s;timuli nece&s;&s;ary for the production and &s;u&s;tainment of Life can be ab&s;orbed and properly diffu&s;ed through the organized frame: and, indeed, &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages might be produced to countenance the &s;u&s;picion, that this ju&s;tly admired Lecturer &s;o far agrees with the Theory I mean to enforce, as to admit that the Vital Principle is, at lea&s;t, <HI>&s;u&s;tained</HI> and re-invigorated (if not ab&s;olutely generated), not independently by the blood it&s;elf, but from &s;omething imbibed in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs; for he acknowledges, that <Q>"Before blood is capable of <HI>giving
<PB N="21" REF="25">life,"</HI></Q> (in other words, according to his own theory, before it is alive), <Q>"it mu&s;t have circulated through the lungs, where it undergoes &s;ome e&s;&s;ential change. Perhaps,"</Q> continues he, <Q>"it is <HI>then</HI> in its &s;econd &s;tate, or vivification."</Q></P>
<P>It is obvious to remark, that if the blood is not <Q>"in its &s;tate of vivification"</Q> till it has pa&s;&s;ed through the lungs, Vitality cannot be the property of the blood it&s;elf, but only a con&s;equence of &s;ome <HI>action,</HI> or <HI>&s;uperaddition,</HI> acquired in its pa&s;&s;age through that organ; and, con&s;equently, that the <HI>Vital Principle</HI> (to u&s;e the language of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who con&s;ider Life as a &s;eparate e&s;&s;ence) is to be &s;ought, not in the blood, but in that &s;ubtile element, or whatever it is, which is imbibed by means of the re&s;pitory &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But (if it is not pre&s;umption for me to &s;ay &s;o) there &s;eems to be &s;ome degree of <HI>ob&s;curity</HI>&mdash;perhaps, if I were &s;peaking of any man but John Hunter, I &s;hould venture to &s;ay <HI>contradiction,</HI> in the doctrines of the Lecturer, upon this &s;ub|ject; for he immediately afterwards denies that the blood derives its Vitality from its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs, in the following words: <Q>"Perhaps it might be thought that Life is given to the Blood in the Lungs in con&s;equence of the heat applied there, as heat is &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon the Egg; but it mu&s;t be remembered, that <HI>Life is not given to
<PB N="22" REF="26"> the Egg</HI> by heat, only <HI>action produced by it."</HI></Q> By which it &s;hould &s;eem that he means to be under&s;tood as con&s;idering the Vital Principle to be <HI>a property of the blood it&s;elf</HI> (&s;o long as it continues in its perfect &s;tate) independent of re&s;piration; and that this action of the Lungs is only nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of circulation, and the production of action in the other parts of the frame, by the di&s;tribution of this principle.</P>
<P>And yet, if the Egg be alive (which, let it be remember|ed, I do not po&s;itively admit), how can this be? &s;ince (pre|vious to the alteration taking place, from the application of heat, during the period of incubation), it contains no blood whatever; and, con&s;equently, if the <HI>Vital Principle</HI> be in the blood, mu&s;t be alive without the principle of life&mdash;a paradox, which, perhaps, it would be a little entertaining to hear the advocates of this doctrine explain.</P>
<P>Not, however, to dwell upon &s;o ambiguous a pa&s;&s;age, there are, in the Lectures of this truly great man, &s;ufficient foundations for the opinion apparently entertained by the Editors of the work above quoted, as well as by &s;everal of his pupils and admirers&mdash;namely, That he means to repre&s;ent <HI>Vitality,</HI> or, according to his own expre&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Vital Prin|ciple,</HI> as re&s;iding originally, and in an emphatic &s;en&s;e, in the
<PB N="23" REF="27"><HI>blood,</HI> and derived from it to the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. He even, in the cleare&s;t manner, affirms its <HI>&s;uperior vivifica|tion</HI> over the nerves in particular: for while the&s;e, accord|ing to one of his aphori&s;ms on the <HI>Vitality of the Blood,</HI> are not concerned in <Q>"conveying life to parts, but only direct the motions of the parts,"</Q> the blood is explicitly affirmed not only to <Q>"convey life to the other parts,"</Q> but to be ab|&s;olutely <Q>"the <HI>living &s;upport</HI> of the nerves them&s;elves:"</Q> by which it is evident, that we mu&s;t under&s;tand not only that the <HI>nouri&s;hment</HI> of the&s;e &s;en&s;itive organs, but even their <HI>Vitality,</HI> is derived, not from their organization and the &s;timuli (of which they are, perhaps, the important repo&s;itories, or re&s;er|voirs), but from the Vital Principle peculiarly re&s;ident in the blood, and depo&s;ited there for the purpo&s;e of being commu|nicated and diffu&s;ed to other parts.</P>
<P>The&s;e other parts then being dependant (according to this theory) upon the blood, not only for their &s;upport and en|largement, but, al&s;o, in an immediate view, for their Vitali|ty, it is clear that if the &s;y&s;tem of the Lecturer does not go the whole length with Mo&s;es, of &s;aying that the blood of the animal is the life thereof, at lea&s;t that he &s;uppo&s;es Life, of it&s;elf, and independent of any particular <HI>action</HI> or &s;timu|lus to belong to, or be a property of, the blood; while to the re&s;t of the animal &s;ub&s;tance, it only belongs in a &s;econdary
<PB N="24" REF="28">&s;ignification, as being imparted by the blood. And this, per|haps, we are the more bound to con&s;ider as his real meaning, as he maintains the doctrine of its vitality even after coa|gulation; and even delivers it as his opinion that this phe|nomenon <Q>"is owing to an action of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation in the blood, or to an effort for its continuance."</Q> So that, ac|cording to this po&s;ition, and the arguments that follow upon the circum&s;tance of coagula becoming va&s;cular under parti|cular circum&s;tances, we are not to con&s;ider the vitality of the blood as the con&s;equence of its &s;tate, condition, and har|mony, with the other <HI>parts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Note, page 19.</NOTE> of the body, but to look upon it as a principle inherent in it, and equally a property of it, whether in one &s;tate and &s;ituation, or another&mdash;whether in its ve&s;&s;els, or in a &s;tate of extrava&s;ation&mdash;whether in a fluid or a &s;olid form&mdash;a circum&s;tance attributed to no other of the component parts of the animal frame: the&s;e being con|&s;idered as having no other principle of life, but what they immediately derive either from the blood, or from their harmony with the &s;y&s;tem in general; who&s;e re&s;ources mu&s;t cea&s;e before any material change in their nature and &s;ub&s;tance can take place. And yet, if this argument is properly &s;ifted, I que&s;tion whether it will make much for the Vitality of the blood, in any point of view whatever. For as no &s;imilar change in any other fluid was ever brought forward as an evidence of a Vital Principle in &s;uch fluid, I cannot
<PB N="25" REF="29">&s;ee that any phenomenon, that would not be con&s;idered as a proof of Vitality, or of an effort of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, in any other in&s;tance, &s;hould have &s;uch &s;tre&s;s laid upon it, for &s;uch purpo&s;es in the ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the generality, probably to all, of the fluids capable of <HI>congelation,</HI> it might, perhaps, be objected, that they afford no parallel example of permanent change of &s;tructure; as they are capable of re&s;olution to their original form, which blood is not. But petrified &s;ub&s;tances, in which the change is permanent and entire, might at lea&s;t be &s;aid, in this re&s;pect, to have as good a claim to the attributes of a vital principle and action of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, as the blood, which is here &s;aid to metamorpho&s;e it&s;elf into &s;omething el&s;e, in order to continue its exi&s;tence. Be&s;ides, if the coagulation of the blood be an action of its Vitality, and an effort of its Vital Principle for its pre&s;ervation, how comes it that it will coagulate after having been frozen; for John Hunter admits, that what he calls the Vital Principle of the Egg, is de&s;troyed by freezing; and, indeed, nothing is more injurious to vitality of every kind, than the frigorific proce&s;s: and yet Mr. Hew&s;on informs us, that blood may be completely frozen, and pre|&s;erved in that condition (as other dead animal &s;ub&s;tances may) for a con&s;iderable time; and yet, after it is again re|duced, by an increa&s;e of temperature, to its fluid form, it will coagulate ju&s;t as u&s;ual.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="30">
<P>Having thus examined the general &s;tate of the que&s;tion, I &s;hall preceed to review the &s;ix arguments brought forward upon the authority of the lecturer, in the Encyclopedia, in &s;upport of the opinion previou&s;ly quoted&mdash;(<HI>vide page</HI> 18 <HI>of this E&s;&s;ay.)</HI> For the more ample &s;tatement of the&s;e, how|ever, (not to &s;well my E&s;&s;ay to an unnece&s;&s;ary length, by quotations from a book, which is in the hands of every body) I &s;hall refer to the work it&s;elf.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, derived from <Q>"the power which the blood po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of uniting living parts,"</Q> it is to be remembered, that this is only the ca&s;e in tho&s;e in|&s;tances where blood is immediately &s;upplied by the parts to be united, and where, con&s;equently, from its temperature, its a&s;&s;imilitude to the parts with which it is to enter into com|bination, its glutinous texture, and a variety of obvious rea&s;ons, it may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to form the be&s;t cement|ing medium; and the healing of wounds, by other applica|tions, which have evidently no Vital Principle, appears to me &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that this is no proof of Vitality. All that is requi&s;ite, in either in&s;tance, being to keep the living parts in contact, and exclude the air, and other injurious, extra|neous particles, till Nature has a &s;ufficient opportunity of ex|erting her re&s;toring powers.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="31">
<P>The blood, yet warm, and fluid from the wound, may na|turally enough be expected to enter intimately into the dif|ferent portions of the &s;evered parts; and all further injuries being thus prevented, it is neither &s;ingular nor &s;trange, that the &s;eparated ve&s;&s;els &s;hould again unite, from the attraction of &s;imilar particles &s;o frequently ob&s;erved, when circum|&s;tances are favourable to the experiment; and that the &s;tream of blood, driving towards its u&s;ual cour&s;e, &s;hould at la&s;t find its way again through the coagulum formed by the blood thus bound up with the injured parts, and complete their re&s;to|ration.&mdash;2 and 6. Exactly upon the &s;ame principle I account for the phenomenon from which the &s;econd argument is drawn; namely&mdash;That <Q>"coagula of extrava&s;ated blood will become va&s;cular:"</Q> for this, I believe, is never the ca&s;e, except when the coagula come in contact, or nearly in contact, with arteries previou&s;ly formed. This, therefore, &s;eems to prove nothing more than that coagulated blood, when pre&s;erving a proper degree of temperature, from its &s;ituation, is the proper medium, or &s;oil, into which the arteries may &s;trike and ramify&mdash;all living parts, perhaps, having a tendency to grow and enlarge, &s;o long as &s;ufficient &s;timuli are &s;upplied, and the proper medium is pre&s;ented. For my own part, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that all the preparations I have &s;een, intended to &s;up|port this argument, have only &s;ugge&s;ted a proce&s;s &s;imilar to that ob&s;ervable in vegetation, where the moi&s;t earth, in contact

And hence it is, that I find no difficulty in accounting for the junction of the te&s;ticle of the cock, to the liver of the hen, into who&s;e abdomen it had been introduced, as mentioned in illu&s;tration of the fir&s;t argument; or, for the va&s;cular appear|ance of the coagulum, found between the &s;eparated parts of the fractured <HI>os humeri,</HI> upon which the <HI>&s;ixth,</HI> or rather the reiteration of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> argument, is founded.&mdash;3. As for the third argument, drawn from the power of the blood, to pre|&s;erve an equal degree of temperature in the living body, dur|ing the prevalence of different temperatures of the atmo&s;|phere&mdash;I &s;hall at pre&s;ent make no other an&s;wer to this, than by ob&s;erving, that if the Theory I am about to &s;ugge&s;t is well founded, <HI>that</HI> will be &s;ufficient to account for this pheno|menon, without appeal to any other hypothe&s;is: for if the air may be admitted to be <HI>&s;ufficiently impregnated</HI> with the &s;ame &s;pecific &s;timuli in the colde&s;t, as well as in the hotte&s;t day, there can be no rea&s;on why the blood &s;hould be expect|ed to have a lower degree of temperature on the former than on the latter&mdash;whether it be admitted to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Vital Principle independent of &s;uch &s;timuli, or not.&mdash;4. As for the <Q>"Blood being capable of being acted upon by a &s;timulus,"</Q>&mdash;this is &s;aying no more than may be proved of a variety of things that have confe&s;&s;edly no preten&s;ions to life
<PB N="29" REF="33">whatever: and as the only particular effect which is in&s;tanced as produced by the &s;timulating influence on the blood, (namely coagulation), would never be admitted as a proof of life in any other fluid whatever, it cannot, as far as I am able to di&s;cover, be made any u&s;e of in illu&s;tration of the point in que&s;tion. 5. The fifth argument, that <Q>"the blood pre|&s;erves life in different parts of the body,"</Q> is equally applica|cable to the Theory of the Lecturer, and to my own; for, whether it be con&s;idered as retaining in it&s;elf the <HI>Vital Prin|ciple,</HI> or being the &s;ole medium through which Vitality can be produced, we mu&s;t equally admit its importance, not only in pre&s;erving, but in diffu&s;ing life: I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that the collateral part of the argument, which a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>"when the nerves, going to a part, are tied, the part becomes paralytic,"</Q> is, I believe, overthrown by later experiments; and that &s;en&s;ation only, and not the power of acting the mu&s;cles, is interrupted by the ligature of nerves. Upon this, however, (as I certainly do not mean to rob the blood of its vital honours, to be&s;tow them on the Brain and Nerves), I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enlarge; but &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay upon this &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving that, per|haps, the whole doctrine of the Vitality of the Blood (in whatever point of view it may be taken) originated in the mind of the Lecturer, from ob&s;erving the important offices it performs in the fu&s;tainment and reproduction of parts con|fe&s;&s;edly
<PB N="30" REF="34">and palpably alive. Now, that the nerves (for ex|ample), as well as every other part of the animal body, are nouri&s;hed by the blood, is &s;ufficiently evident, and that, but for &s;uch nouri&s;hment, the&s;e parts mu&s;t, by exhau&s;tion, lo&s;e their Vitality, is equally obvious; but that the fluid, nou|ri&s;hing and &s;u&s;taining a living part, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be it&s;elf alive, is what I cannot readily admit, becau&s;e it &s;eems to con|tradict the known laws and phenomena of nature. Air and water are the proper and nece&s;&s;ary nouri&s;hment of plants, without which vegetation mu&s;t quickly be exhau&s;ted and ex|pire; but no one will, therefore, contend, that air and water are alive: nor will the difficulty be removed, by objecting, that air and water are only the <HI>food</HI> of plants, and that the nouri&s;hment of the vegetable is <HI>immediately</HI> derived from the circulating &s;ap, as that of the animal from the blood; for as no dige&s;tive proce&s;s can be a&s;&s;igned to the plant, air and water mu&s;t be the <HI>immediate</HI> nouri&s;hers of the &s;ap; and, con|&s;equently, the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t either be, that the <HI>living &s;ap</HI> is nouri&s;hed by air and water, which <HI>are not alive,</HI> or that the <HI>&s;ap, which is not alive,</HI> nouri&s;hes the <HI>living plant;</HI> which, with re&s;pect to the argument before us, is ju&s;t the &s;ame: in &s;hort, it might as well be maintained, that <HI>whatever &s;upports a &s;en&s;i|tive part mu&s;t it&s;elf be &s;en&s;itive;</HI> or that nothing but nerve &s;hould nouri&s;h a nerve, or mu&s;cle but mu&s;cle, &amp;c. which would drive us back to the ob&s;olete opinion of tho&s;e philo&s;o|phers,
<PB N="31" REF="35">who maintained, that all things contain the compo|nent parts of all things; and, in &s;hort, would even compel us to appeal to the doctrine of an ancient &s;ect of Athei&s;ts, who, to get rid of the nece&s;&s;ity of a Deity, in&s;i&s;ted upon the original and eternal Vitality of matter, and accounted for the growth and nouri&s;hment of living things, by arguing, that the particles that nouri&s;hed them were them&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a living principle. If, however, we abide by the mode of rea&s;oning &s;ugge&s;ted by the known phenomena of nature, a much more &s;imple theory will pre&s;ent it&s;elf, in the evident tendency of &s;mall accumulations of matter (when placed under favourable circum&s;tances) to a&s;&s;imilate, and even identify them&s;elves with the larger ma&s;&s;es to which they adhere, or with which they enter into combination; which will &s;ufficiently account for the nouri&s;hment and growth of the living body, without attributing Vitality to the blood, by which it is &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Having thus taken as brief a &s;urvey as the nature of the &s;ubject would permit, of &s;ome of the principal opinions, that have, at different times, commanded the attention of the &s;cien|tific world, I &s;hall proceed to the profe&s;&s;ed object of my E&s;&s;ay; namely&mdash;to con&s;ider of the Definition. Of this un|dertaking the difficulty mu&s;t be readily admitted; or, &s;hould pride or petulance be inclined to deny it, the &s;ubterfuges to
<PB N="32" REF="36">which the mo&s;t ingenious ornaments of medical &s;cience have been driven, would furni&s;h a &s;ufficient reply. Some have given it up entirely, and &s;atisfied them&s;elves with a <HI>nega|tive te&s;t,</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>po&s;itive definition;</HI> a&s;&s;erting, that the only criterion of its ab&s;ence is putrefaction: but the&s;e cautious maxims, though they may be adopted, for &s;ecurity, by the practitioner employed in the benevolent labour of &s;natching from premature di&s;&s;olution the pale victims of accident or de&s;pair, will not &s;atisfy the &s;pirit of the philo&s;ophical en|quirer: he, indeed, may frequently be <HI>compelled</HI> to wander in the gloom of doubt and negation; but his active mind will &s;corn &s;uch &s;ullen darkne&s;s, and pant for the glorious pro&s;pects of truth and certitude; to which, however, I have not the arrogance to profe&s;s that I &s;hall conduct him.</P>
<P>By &s;ome it has been contended, that life con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>action,</HI> or excited irritability; by others, &s;imply in organization: but both of the&s;e would admit a variety of in&s;tances, that can lay no claim to any &s;ort of Vitality, much le&s;s to that &s;ort of Vitality which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent paper: with re&s;pect to the former, I need only in&s;tance, that parch|men, leather, thread, &amp;c. may be excited to con&s;iderable action by either heat or moi&s;ture, as may al&s;o a variety of light bodies, by the application of electricity: and, as for orga|nization, this I con&s;ider to be no other than <HI>that arrangement
<PB N="33" REF="37">of di&s;&s;imilar parts, by which a harmony and communication of the whole is produced, &s;o as to enable it to pre&s;erve it&s;elf in a given &s;tate, and re&s;i&s;t its own di&s;&s;olution.</HI> This, therefore, is very inadequate to our idea of life; for matter will continue to be organized when LIFE has cea&s;ed; as it al&s;o, I conceive, mu&s;t be organized before LIFE begins; in illu&s;tration of which, I &s;hould rather be inclined to quote the in&s;tance of the Egg, which (with all the deference due to the high authority of John Hunter) appears to me <HI>to be organized,</HI> though <HI>not alive,</HI> previous to incubation: I conceive al&s;o, that many bodies may be con&s;idered as organized, that were never intended to live at all. To tho&s;e, however, who wi&s;h to con&s;ider life as en|tirely dependant on Organization, I &s;ubmit the following Definition: <HI>That perfect harmony of organized parts, by which the animal frame is rendered &s;o far &s;u&s;ceptible of the proper &s;timuli, as to have its functions, or any of them, induced upon &s;uch &s;timuli being applied:</HI> and this the Society will be kind enough to keep in their minds, as what I mean, when I come hereafter to &s;peak of <HI>Specific Organization.</HI>&mdash; Others have con&s;idered Animal Life as con&s;i&s;ting in the performance of the Animal functions: but this definition would exclude, from all preten&s;ions to Vitality, many beings, which common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t admit to be alive; for an animal may certainly live, when it neither does, nor can perform, all its functions; and, as for a&s;certaining which may be di&s;|pen&s;ed
<PB N="34" REF="38">with, and which may not, this, I believe, has never been &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted.</P>
<P>The definition of John Hunter appears to me particu|larly vague and un&s;atisfactory. <Q><HI>"Life,"</HI></Q> &s;ays he, <Q><HI>"does not con&s;i&s;t in any modification of matter:</HI> it either is <HI>&s;omething &s;u|peradded to matter,</HI> or el&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>peculiar arrange|ment of certain fine particles of matter,</HI> which, being <HI>thus di&s;po&s;ed,</HI> acquire the properties of Life."</Q> The Di&s;ciples of this ju&s;tly celebrated man mu&s;t pardon me, if I am inclined to &s;mile at this definition, or rather indefinite de&s;cription of Life, and to declare, that I never in my life met with any thing more completely incomprehen&s;ible. <Q>"Life does not con&s;i&s;t in any <HI>modification of matter</HI>;"</Q> and yet, perhaps, <Q>"it con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>peculiar arrangement</HI> of certain <HI>fine particles of matter,</HI> which, being thus <HI>di&s;po&s;ed,</HI> acquire the <HI>properties</HI> of Life!"</Q> What is the <HI>finene&s;s</HI> of the&s;e particles of matter, but a <HI>modification of matter?</HI>&mdash;What is the <HI>peculiar arrangement</HI>&mdash; what the <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the&s;e particles, but a modification of matter? In &s;hort, is not this telling us, in other words, that Life po&s;itively <HI>is not a modification of matter,</HI> but that yet, per|haps, it <HI>is a modification of matter?</HI> As for the other po&s;ition, that Life con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;omething &s;uperadded to matter,</HI> I had once occa&s;ion to controvert this incomprehen&s;ible axiom at the Lyceum, when, all of a &s;udden, a &s;neer went
<PB N="35" REF="39">round the Theatre, and a hundred mouths were filled with fury again&s;t me, as though I had &s;tood up, in the pre&s;ence of the Pope and his Cardinals, to deny the doctrine of the Tri|nity. I &s;hall venture, however, once more to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;piritual allu&s;ions of this &s;entence are too fine for the gro&s;s conceptions of my material organs. According to my dull comprehen&s;ions, <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>vacuum</HI> &s;tand preci&s;ely in the &s;ame degrees of contradi&s;tinction as <HI>&s;omething</HI> and <HI>nothing;</HI> and, in the former ca&s;e, as in the latter, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to admit <HI>the negation of the one,</HI> without, at the &s;ame time, acknow|ledging <HI>the affirmation of the other.&mdash;Where there is not matter, there there is vacuum;&mdash;where vacuum is not, there there mu&s;t be matter.</HI> Tho&s;e effects, which are not produced by the operations of &s;ome <HI>modification of matter,</HI> or, in other words, of <HI>&s;omething,</HI> mu&s;t of cour&s;e be produced by &s;ome <HI>modification of vacuum,</HI> or, in other words, <HI>of nothing;</HI> and how vacuum, or nothing, can be &s;o modified as to produce Life, I leave to the con&s;ideration of the Metaphy&s;icians. It is evident, however, that this is not what the Lecturer means; becau&s;e, though he denies the modification of matter, he admits the &s;uperaddition of <HI>&s;omething.</HI>&mdash;But what is this <HI>&s;omething that is not matter?</HI>&mdash;Is it <HI>Spirit?</HI> I certainly do not think it the part of a philo&s;opher ab&s;olutely to deny the exi&s;tence of every thing that he cannot demon&s;trate; but, as contradic|tions are not to be admitted, I mu&s;t, for my own part, main|tain, that if there is any &s;uch <HI>thing</HI> entering into the animal
<PB N="36" REF="40">compo&s;ition (though our &s;en&s;es have never yet been capable of taking cognizance of it) as <HI>Spirit,</HI> having an exi&s;tence &s;e|parate and di&s;tinct from organization, and that gro&s;s peri&s;h|able kind of &s;ub&s;tance we call body, that &s;uch <HI>Spirit,</HI> how|ever &s;ubtile, however refined, mu&s;t &s;till be material: and then, indeed, the ab&s;urdity vani&s;hes&mdash;becau&s;e that more &s;ub|tile matter can act upon that which is more gro&s;s and inert, we have &s;ufficient evidence in the action of air, and of the electric fluid. And that this (a fine and &s;ubtile, or aeriform e&s;&s;ence) is the real and genuine meaning of the term <HI>Spirit,</HI> about which divines and philo&s;ophers have &s;o long been con|tending, is, I conceive, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trable, not only from its etymology, but al&s;o from the common application of the word in the other &s;en&s;es in which it is &s;till retained: as, for example,&mdash;by the &s;pirit of any di&s;tilled or fermented fluid, we always mean to expre&s;s that more &s;ubtile and vola|tile principle (the <HI>alkohol</HI> of the chemi&s;ts) mixed with, and dif|fu&s;ed through &s;uch fluid, and who&s;e materiality (notwith|&s;tanding its &s;uperior &s;ubtility) is no more to be que&s;tioned than that of the gro&s;&s;er parts of the fluid with which it en|ters into combination. In &s;hort, it will perhaps be found, that all Nouns, immediately or arbitrarily derived from Verbs,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The natural mode of derivation &s;eems to be of the Verb from the Noun; this being evidently likely to precede in the fir&s;t rude attempts at language: but there are many words now in u&s;e, which mu&s;t have come to us in the contrary direction&mdash;as <HI>Heaven,</HI> for example, which &s;till retains, &s;imply and ab&s;olutely, the meaning (that which is <HI>heaved</HI> or <HI>lifted up</HI>), which it brought from the parent verb, <HI>to beave.</HI></NOTE> whether of the &s;ame, or any other language, &s;till re|tain,
<PB N="37" REF="41">in a con&s;iderable degree, their paternal &s;ignification; and &s;pirit mu&s;t, perhaps, be admitted to bear no other mean|ing than the Latin <HI>&s;piro (to breathe),</HI> from which it is con|fe&s;&s;edly taken: or, if we mu&s;t needs make a di&s;tinct living exi&s;tence of it, then can it po&s;&s;ibly mean no other than a vital a&euml;riform &s;ub&s;tance, diffu&s;ed though the frame, and giv|ing animation to the re&s;pective parts. So that, at any rate, this <HI>&s;omething &s;uperadded to matter,</HI> can only be a more re|fined &s;pecies of matter added to that which is more gro&s;s; and, of cour&s;e, it con&s;titutes that very modification which the Lecturer denies.&mdash;It has been &s;tated, in defence of this pa&s;&s;age, that by &s;ome <HI>thing</HI> &s;uperadded, no more is meant than &s;ome <HI>quality;</HI> but this would by no means mend the matter, &s;ince nothing can be added but what has a previous and &s;eparate exi&s;tence. Two things brought together may, it is true, occa&s;ion the exi&s;tence of a third, different from both; but this third is not added, but produced. Now <HI>qualities</HI> have no &s;eparate exi&s;tence, nor can they even be conceived in the imagination, otherwi&s;e than as connected with the things of which they de&s;cribe the &s;hades or attri|butes: they are, in fact, &s;olely and purely, modifications of matter, and, con&s;equently, this interpretation involves all the ab&s;urdity and contradiction of which I have before com|plained.</P>
<P>But it is much more ea&s;y to find fault with the definitions of others, than to frame &s;uch as are not faulty: I &s;hall pro|ceed,
<PB N="38" REF="42">therefore, to my ta&s;k with caution; and, beginning with a general, proceed to a particular definition.&mdash;Life then, in the animal, we will &s;ay, is <HI>that &s;tate of action, by which the functions, or any of the functions of the animal, are carried on.</HI> This definition, it is true, neither points out how the action is &s;uppo&s;ed to be induced, nor the &s;tate of the animal previous to the induction: I proceed, therefore, to add, that, <HI>previous to the exi&s;tence of life, the body mu&s;t have attained a</HI> SPECIFIC ORGANIZATION; and that <HI>Life,</HI> or, in other terms, <HI>the Vital Action, is induced by the application of proper &s;timuli:</HI> thus, then, <HI>life in the animal is that &s;tate of action (induced by &s;pecific &s;ti|muli upon matter &s;pecifically organized), by which the animal functions, or any of them, are carried on.</HI> To the whole of this, I know, may be objected, the a&s;&s;ertion of that great man, whom, with &s;uch repeated arrogance, I have ventured to op|po&s;e: namely&mdash;That Life may exi&s;t without matter, being in <Q>"a &s;tate of action, and the property of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation may alone be pre&s;ent, Life being at the &s;ame time pre&s;ent in its full force."</Q> To the &s;olitary in&s;tance, however, brought in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, I mu&s;t reply, that the life of the Egg is by no means obvious to my under&s;tanding; for, although the Egg be &s;o far organized as to be endowed with the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; &s;o, al&s;o, are various fruits, &amp;c. who&s;e Vitality, I &s;uppo&s;e, after they are plucked, will not be contended for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some, perhaps, will contend for the life of the kernels, &s;eeds, &amp;c. I, how|ever, &s;hould content my&s;elf with contending for their &s;pecific organization; by which, upon the application of proper &s;timuli, they are rendered &s;u&s;ceptible of Life.</NOTE>. In &s;hort, it does not appear to have any one
<PB N="39" REF="43">property or attribute, which, in any other &s;ub&s;tance, would be deemed a &s;ufficient te&s;t of Vitality, till the &s;timulus of heat, being properly applied, &s;o meliorates the arrangement of par|ticles, as to induce the <HI>&s;pecific organization</HI> e&s;&s;ential to the &s;u&s;ceptibility and production of Vital Action.&mdash; By this, then, it will appear, that I con&s;ider <HI>the prelimi|nary principles of life</HI> to be a <HI>&s;pecific organization</HI> and a <HI>&s;pecific &s;timulus; the perfect contact of the&s;e</HI> to be <HI>the immediate cau&s;e,</HI> and <HI>life it&s;elf</HI> to be <HI>the &s;tate of action produced by this union.</HI></P>
<P>It will now only be expected, that I &s;hould give an opi|nion upon the nature of the &s;timulus required. But, in order to do this, I mu&s;t fir&s;t premi&s;e, that I con&s;ider the Blood, in|dependent of its nutritive power, as the &s;pecific medium by which the &s;timuli mu&s;t be conveyed to the different parts of the organized frame, &s;o as to produce the Vital Action. This Blood, then, in its pa&s;&s;age through the Lungs, collects a &s;omething, which generates a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> heat (for it is evident, that heat, unle&s;s thus generated, will not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e), which it diffu&s;es through the whole va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and then (exhau&s;ted of its vivifying power) returns again to the lungs, to exhale whatever noxious particles it may have collected, and to inhale a fre&s;h portion of the &s;ame vivifying principle. But what is this &s;omething&mdash;this vivifying principle?&mdash;Is it atmo&s;pheric air it&s;elf?&mdash;Certainly not. The coats of the ar|teries, and the membranous linings of the cells of the lungs, forbid the acce&s;s of &s;uch an element; be&s;ides, it has been
<PB N="41" REF="44">proved by experiment, that in the arteries of the living body there is no air. Something, however, it mu&s;t be, that is con|tained in the atmo&s;phere, and &s;omething of a powerful and exqui&s;itely &s;ubtile nature.</P>
<P>If, then, we look upon the component parts of our atmo&s;|phere, what can we di&s;cover &s;o competent to the ta&s;k&mdash;&s;o &s;ubtile, &s;o powerful, &s;o nearly approaching to that idea of an ethereal medium, which &s;ome philo&s;ophers have &s;uppo&s;ed ne|ce&s;&s;ary to complete the chain of connection between the di|vine immortal e&s;&s;ence, and the dull inertion of created mat|ter, as the electrical fluid?&mdash;that principle, who&s;e pre&s;ence, under &s;uch a variety of forms, is con&s;tantly pre&s;enting it&s;elf to the re&s;earches of the philo&s;opher!&mdash;who&s;e agency, in &s;o many of the phenomena of Nature, we are daily detecting! and which, perhaps, will one time be di&s;covered to be the real principle by which all heat and action are originally generated and maintained!</P>
