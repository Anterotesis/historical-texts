<P>A melancholly accident having, within the&s;e few days, taken place in this neigh|bourhood, from a quantity of Opium given to a young boy, by mi&s;take for a different medicine, which &s;oon proved fatal, gave ri&s;e to the following remarks. The Author hopes the public will receive them with candour, &s;ince they are laid before them to guard them in future, and prevent them from keeping in their hou&s;es, as family medicines, drugs of violent operation, undi&s;tingui&s;hed by proper labels from more innocent &s;ub|&s;tances
<PB N="4" REF="4">of the Materia Medica: or &s;hould the like again take place, that they may from the&s;e hints, be the better prepared to put in force the means of cure, he &s;ubmits to their con&s;ideration, which on many &s;uch occa&s;ions, (for too many &s;uch are on record) have been found effectual when they were had early recour&s;e to, and &s;trenuou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P>THIS drug of high u&s;e, and de&s;erved e&s;|timation in Medicine, like many others of the virulent Vegetable Poi&s;ons, becomes, when incautiou&s;ly exhibited by tho&s;e le&s;s acquainted with its powers, and when given thro' mi&s;take, &s;peedily de&s;tructive; chang|ing the regular motions of the living body into irregular and violent; inducing &s;tupe|faction; convul&s;ions; appoplexy &amp;c. &s;oon to be followed by a total deprivation of life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eos, qui Opium copio&s;ius acceperunt, &s;equitur in &s;omnum gravem collap&s;io, mentis &s;opor, et &s;en&s;us ab|lienatio cum frigiditate et pruritu vehementi, ita ut hom|inem exitet.

<P>WITHOUT entering into a di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ubject at large, or a detail of the various opinions, and hypothe&s;es that have lately, as well as heretofore, been advanced relative to its mode of operation as a medi|cine, this being foreign to my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e, let me at once &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a quan|tity received into the &s;tomach, as mu&s;t in a &s;hort time induce death, &s;hould attempts, (and the&s;e almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly) not be made to prevent its baneful effects; and indeed, admitting them made, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, (&s;o great may the force of the poi&s;on be) that its effects may be exerted even in a very &s;hort time, altogether be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of obviating, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="6" REF="6">the mo&s;t diligent application of the mo&s;t rational means.</P>
<P>THIS reflection, however, &s;hould not &s;lacken our endeavours or damp our ardour, but ought rather to &s;timulate us to a trial of all the methods that have been known to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing then to which we are to turn our attention, is the u&s;e of emetics: and let one be thrown down the mo&s;t &s;peedy in its operation.&mdash;Powders of Ipecacuanha, Tartari&s;ed Antimony, Vinegar of Squills, or, perhaps what may &s;till be more quick in exciting the action of the &s;tomach, White Vitriol.&mdash;The contents of the &s;tomach, &s;uppo&s;e the operation &s;ucceeds, &s;hould be examined to find whether any of the Opium has been evacuated; this will be ea&s;ily di&s;|covered by its &s;mell, and will afford en|couragement
<PB N="7" REF="7">to pur&s;ue our fir&s;t advantage, by continuing the vomiting till this organ be compleatly evacuated.</P>
<P>THE do&s;es u&s;ed mu&s;t be in proportion to the exigencies of the ca&s;e, to the dimini&s;hed energy, and &s;en&s;ibility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem in general, and the &s;tomach in particular. If the Opium has begun to exert its effects, the more will be nece&s;&s;ary; and as there is no time to loo&s;e, and inevitable danger, per|haps death, awaiting, we mu&s;t hazard the larger quantities in proportion to the ac|cu&s;tomed do&s;es, and per&s;i&s;t in their u&s;e.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;tupefaction as far as in our power, and the con&s;equent train of bad &s;ymptoms, &s;trong agitation may be u&s;ed, &s;uch as walking, running, &s;haking, &amp;c. this has been &s;trenuou&s;ly recommended by &s;everal Authors. In one ca&s;e, as I am
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y">lately informed by a Medical Gentleman in this county, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter was the &s;ubject of the trial, it appears to have had no &s;mall &s;hare in the cure. The gentleman when a child about &s;ix years of age, having ob|&s;erved his mother take &s;omething from a bottle in her clo&s;et, went afterwards and brought it to his &s;i&s;ter, a child about a year younger than him&s;elf, per&s;uading her to take of it, which he intended to do al&s;o, but his &s;i&s;ter after taking &s;ome complained it was bad ta&s;ted, on which he took none; &s;he &s;oon became affected, the family were a|larmed, and their Apothecary was &s;ent for. Among other things he ordered the child to be walked about though in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, being held up between two &s;ervants, and kept in con&s;tant motion for &s;everal hours. She recovered with difficul|ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<P>To the&s;e &s;hould be added Stimulants of all kinds, as Volatile Salts to the no&s;e, Bli&s;ters to the &s;kin, &amp;c. If epi&s;pa&s;tics are applied, they &s;hould be placed on the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts, or joints, as the ancles, arms, in&s;ide of the legs, and &s;oles of the feet, and wherever the body is thinne&s;t of fle&s;h, and the nervous fibrillae mo&s;t numerous.</P>
<P>IT may be objected to the u&s;e of bli&s;ters, that they will act too &s;lowly in a ca&s;e of this nature, where expedition is &s;o requi&s;ite. But without attempting formally to remove this objection, which we think might be ea&s;ily done, as it is not their evacuant, but their &s;timulant effects for which we con|&s;ider them expedient, we &s;hall only &s;ay, that their application even in that ca&s;e, can do no harm by interrupting other means; and on this ground alone, I would not have them omitted.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<P>IF we can rou&s;e the mind &s;o far that it will feel pain, &s;o far one point is thereby gained, which adds &s;omewhat to our hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;hould quicken our exertions.</P>
<P>I know not how far Electricity might in this &s;en&s;e be advantageous. As it is acknow|ledged, however, one of the mo&s;t powerful, though tran&s;ient &s;timulants, and as it may be applied to the human body, even for a length of time, and frequency with the utmo&s;t &s;afety, we can run no great hazard in giving it a trial, e&s;pecially as machines for its commodious application are now in almo&s;t every body's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The poi&s;on being of the highe&s;t &s;edative nature, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timulants would &s;eem obviou&s;ly indicated as its antidote.</P>
<P>IN the ca&s;es of drowned per&s;ons, and tho&s;e &s;uffocated by the fumes of charcoal
<PB N="11" REF="11">&amp;c. the analogy thus far holds good, that in <HI>this</HI> as in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> there is a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the functions from a deprivation of &s;en&s;ibility in the &s;y&s;tem. In <HI>tho&s;e</HI> Electricity is &s;trongly recommended.</P>
<P>THE writer of the&s;e hints will not enter here into that part of the Pathology which &s;uppo&s;es the operation of the Opium to be by augmenting, or rarefying the volume of the blood in the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem in general, and the head in particular, where|by a turge&s;cence, and over-di&s;tention of the Ve&s;&s;els of this organ are &s;aid to be parti|cuarly pre&s;ent, and from which the &s;ymp|toms of apoplexy are argued to ari&s;e. Of this opinion among others was the celebra|ted Mead. He affirms that it enflames the Stomach, and rarefies the blood to &s;uch a degree, that the Ve&s;&s;els cannot again reco|ver
<PB N="12" REF="12">their tone, whereupon apoplectic &s;ymp|toms, &amp;c. will en&s;ue; to prove which he relates an experiment which he made with it on a Dog.</P>
<P>PERHAPS all &s;timulants, (and it appears to me, by the bye, that all &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach exert fir&s;t a &s;timulant power, whatever their after action may be,) have the effect le&s;s or more of &s;ending a greater quantity of blood to the head, at lea&s;t quickening the circulation by which the face becomes flu&s;hed; but &s;urely &s;timu|lants, for this rea&s;on alone, are not here to be omitted. The &s;timulant power of the Opium &s;eems tran&s;itory, the &s;edative &s;oon follows. And now, if we can rou&s;e the powers of the heart to exert their wonted action, and renew the motion of the blood flowing at pre&s;ent languidly, we need the le&s;s dread this &s;uppo&s;ed plethora, as the con&s;equence
<PB N="13" REF="13">mu&s;t be a more equitable circulation, and di&s;tribution of the blood. I know no proof, however, that this fluid is augmenting in its volume, but that it is in a &s;tate almo&s;t of &s;tagnation is evident.</P>
<P>Dr. Al&s;ton, in the pre&s;ence, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Fullarton, a gentleman &s;killed in micro&s;copical ob&s;ervations, in Augu&s;t 1733, conveyed into the &s;tomach of a frog &s;ome Opium di&s;&s;olved in water, and after putting it into a gla&s;s cylinder, they adapted the micro&s;cope to the membrane between the toes, in &s;uch a manner, that they had a di&s;tinct view of the circulation of the blood in this part. The Dr. had found before that Opium killed the&s;e ani|mals, and his de&s;ign now was to ob&s;erve its effects on the circulation; no change, however, took place either in the colour or
<PB N="14" REF="14">con&s;i&s;tence of the blood; but the diminu|tion of its velocity was extremely evident, <Q>"for it did not move half &s;o &s;wiftly as it u&s;ed to do in the&s;e creatures."</Q> This ob&s;ervation was repeatedly made; and as the effects of the Opium went off, the blood became gradually quicker in its motion. When the frog had entirely recovered its vigour, they forced more Opium into its &s;tomach, and ob&s;erving again, &s;aw again the &s;ame diminution of the blood's velocity.</P>
<P>FROM Mr. Ram&s;ay's experiment (made in April 1755) on a dog, we have a fur|ther proof of the pul&s;e becoming &s;lower. The heart of this animal in its natural &s;tate beat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Med. E&s;s.</NOTE> 150 times in a minute. Four minutes after the injection of the Opium into the cavity of the abdomen, he fell down &s;en&s;e|le&s;s. Mr. R. opened the thorax, which &s;eemed to give the Dog no pain, and he felt
<PB N="15" REF="15">plainly the motion of the heart thro' the pleura. It beat now only 76 times in a minute, and became &s;lower. Immediately after counting the pul&s;e, he cut the ribs on each &s;ide of the &s;ternum in the common way, and laid them back, by which the heart was brought into view. It appeared quite turgid.</P>
<P>FROM Dr. Whytt's experiments, we have likewi&s;e ample proof of the le&s;&s;ened motion of the blood, after the application of Opium, "the veins," he &s;ays, "after a large do&s;e of Opium e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the brain become much &s;welled, whence it has been thought, that Opium produces its effects in the bodies of animals partly at lea&s;t, by rarefying the blood, and com|pre&s;&s;ing the brain; but this di&s;tention of the veins &s;eems to be no more than a con|&s;equence of a very &s;low motion of the blood
<PB N="16" REF="16">thro' the heart, on account of the in&s;en&s;i|bility with which this organ is affected." The Author tells us that in frogs, into who&s;e &s;tomach, and inte&s;tines he had in|jected Opium, he not only found the heart's auricle, but the great viens leading to it much di&s;tended with blood. From all this it mu&s;t follow, that the heart and arterial &s;y&s;tem being &s;o reduced in their irritability cannot propel the blood with &s;ufficient force thro' the larger ve&s;&s;els near, much le&s;s thro' the extreme ones, and le&s;s &s;till thro' the Veins.</P>
<P>Dr. Leigh gave two grs. of the re&s;in of Opium to a healthy man, of 30 years of age, his pul&s;e was then at 60 &s;trokes in a minute, half an hour after it ro&s;e to 72; this proves what we have already hinted, that the fir&s;t operation of this, as well as other drugs, is that of a &s;timulus; but be|hold!
<PB N="17" REF="17">in a &s;hort time it fell down to 55. was full and &s;trong; and now head-ach, vertigo, and drow&s;ine&s;s &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame gentleman gave three grs. of the gummy part of Opium to a young woman. In ten minutes her pul&s;e fell 13 &s;trokes; became al&s;o full and &s;trong.</P>
<P>To a third per&s;on al&s;o, he gave Opium, pul&s;e ro&s;e &s;ix &s;trokes in a minute, but in a quarter of an hour it fell 15, and became extremely full.</P>
<P>ON the &s;uppo&s;ition, however, of rare|faction of this fluid, as well as inflam|mation, which has been contended was produced. Geoffroy, and others of the antient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot is among the number who advi&s;e bleeding, from the u&s;e of Opium, in a quantity too great for health, in my opinion, without a ju&s;t foundation; he &s;ays the patient is to be treated as if he had a &s;anguine apoplexy.</NOTE> phy&s;icians recommended, and
<PB N="18" REF="18">practi&s;ed, V. S. without duly con&s;idering, we apprehend, that it is a mo&s;t powerfully debilitating means, le&s;&s;ening the vigour of tho&s;e functions which are already become too debile; and without reflecting, that as the &s;tomach is the place of action, the part fir&s;t affected, relief can only be ra|tionally &s;ought for by applications chiefly to this organ. Should evacuations, how|ever, by blood letting be at all practi&s;ed, &s;carifications on the head, or opening the jugular veins, or temporal artery would appear preferable to general V. Section.</P>
<P>FROM an experiment of the celebrated Dr. Mead on a dog, which he killed by Opium, this practice would &s;eem to re|ceive &s;ome countenance, for on di&s;&s;ection he found the blood ve&s;&s;els of the brain very full, and took a large grume of concreted blood from the upper part of it, as he cut
<PB N="19" REF="19">into the &s;inus longitudinalis.&mdash;No extra|va&s;ated &s;erum was found either in the ven|tricles, or any of the membranes. The &s;tomach was wonderfully di&s;tended, though empty of every thing but &s;ome water and Opium; parcels of frothy mucus &s;wam in it, and its in&s;ide was as clean as if &s;craped and wa&s;hed from all the &s;lime of the glands; &s;ome redne&s;s was di&s;covered here and there, as if in the beginning of an inflammation; the pylorus was found contracted.</P>
<P>BUT even under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;hould be inclined to defer opening the&s;e ve&s;&s;els till &s;ymptoms of apoplexy had com|menced, and other means, better adapted to the cure, had been pur&s;ued ineffectually.</P>
<P>Dr. Al&s;ton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Doctor denies the rarefaction of the fluids in the&s;e ca&s;es.</NOTE> makes a curious ob&s;erva|tion, which may be mentioned here;
<PB N="20" REF="20">while he viewed the &s;low motion in the foot of the frog, as above related, he took notice that the frequency of the pul&s;e was as u&s;ual, but the heart was weak, and had not power to propel the fluid with its wonted force to the extremities. "One thing," &s;ays he, "was ob&s;ervable all along, that notwith&s;tanding the dimini&s;hed velocity of the blood, there was no &s;en|&s;ible dimunition in the frequency of the pul&s;e; yet, when there was no circulation, or progre&s;&s;ive motion of the blood, in this part, (the foot) the pul&s;e was vi&s;ible by an undulatory motion; that is, the blood returned as far back at every <HI>dia&s;tole</HI> of the heart, as it was protruded by the preceding <HI>&s;y&s;tole;</HI> this continued till the frog was quite dead."&mdash;He opened it, and "found nothing in its &s;tomach but a clear mucus, like a jelly, a little coloured with the Opium. Every thing el&s;e &s;eemed perfectly natural: this experiment we often re|peated."
<PB N="21" REF="21">He adds, "and it had always the &s;ame appearance and event."</P>
<P>AFTER the u&s;e of the emetics, the next practice, that I would recommend, is that of cathartics, they &s;eem to hold the &s;econd place; nay, both emetics and cathartics may be conveniently exhibited at the &s;ame time. The&s;e, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons we gave in the u&s;e of emetics, &s;hould be powerful, and of a &s;ufficiently &s;timulating nature. Aloetics, with others, from the tribe of re|&s;inous purges have been recommended; the powder of jalap, &s;cammony, and calomel, are all active; yet vinegar of &s;quills may be perhaps conveniently added to the number; and in &s;ome re&s;pects, at lea&s;t, it may be found preferable, as it both vomits and purges, if admini&s;tered to any extent.</P>
<P>NEUTRAL &s;alts, and e&s;pecially Glau|ber's, have been likewi&s;e recommended:&mdash;
<PB N="22" REF="22">while we u&s;e the&s;e we are not to omit gli&s;|ters: and the&s;e may be made of &s;alt and water, or &s;trong brine, to which may be added purgative ingredients, as may be&s;t &s;ute the pre&s;criber's intention: they &s;hould be thrown up as warm as convenient.</P>
<P>Mr. Ram&s;ay injected into the inte&s;tinum rectum of a &s;mall dog, a &s;olution of two &s;cruples of Opium, in an ounce of water, blood warm, to which he added a drachm of T. Opii. in about a minute his hind legs became convul&s;ed, and in a few mi|mutes more their &s;en&s;ibility was &s;o de|&s;troyed, that when pinced, they &s;eemed in|&s;en&s;ible to pain; in ten minutes more he became quite &s;tupid; fell into a <HI>"profound &s;leep,"</HI> and was convul&s;ed. On ob&s;erving this, a &s;trong &s;olution of &s;ea &s;alt, in water, was injected into his guts; this purged him &s;everely, and occa&s;ioned a prolop&s;us
<PB N="23" REF="23">ani. Soon after he awoke from his &s;leep, and gradually recovered the u&s;e of his hind legs. In a few hours he &s;eemed well in every re&s;pect, but could take no food for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>BEFORE the enema be injected, I would recommend the u&s;e of a &s;uppo&s;itory, this may be prepared in an in&s;tant, with &s;ome paper twi&s;ted up, of a proper thickne&s;s, well covered with oil or hogs lard, and introduced per anum. It will at once bring away the faeces that are hardened, and filling up that part, and thus give room for the enema to penetrate farther into the inte&s;tine.</P>
<P>Dr. Dob&s;on's patient, at Liverpool, was cured by the u&s;e of Glauber's &s;alts and emetics. He had &s;wallowed, in the &s;pace of 24 hours, 26 grains of &s;olid Opium,
<PB N="24" REF="24">in the &s;hop compo&s;ition, called pil. &s;apo|nac. By mi&s;take for pil. aloetic. an ounce. The Doctor ju&s;tly concluded, that in all probability, this would have proved fatal, but for the following favourable circum|&s;tances: Fir&s;t, That the Opium was in a &s;olid form: Secondly, That a &s;trong eme|tic was ordered, and repeated till it pro|duced the de&s;ired effects: And Thirdly, That a free di&s;charge by &s;tool was ob|tained, by per&s;i&s;ting in the u&s;e of Glau|ber's &s;alts. He ob&s;erves what is worthy of remark, that the neutral &s;alts gave relief even before they had occa&s;ioned any eva|cuation. The &s;alts were continued, at proper intervals, for three days after.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;trengthened our hopes, by evacuations, per os &amp; anum, the next to be thought of is that by the per&s;pirable pores. To a&s;&s;i&s;t our endeavours here, the pa|tient
<PB N="25" REF="25">&s;hould be immer&s;ed in warm water, and I &s;hould prefer that of a &s;timulant to that of a relaxing heat; or, the water &s;hould be &s;omewhat above the tepid tem|perature mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed, when the warm bath is applied.</P>
<P>IRECOMMEND this, though at the &s;ame time I am well aware, that too great a degree of heat is unfavourable to per&s;pi|ration; but we are to keep in view the want of due &s;en&s;ibility; and that &s;ince, for this rea&s;on, we were obliged to aug|ment the do&s;es of emetics and purgatives, &s;o mu&s;t we now make u&s;e of a higher de|gree of heat to produce the &s;ame effect. Tho&s;e who contend for a rarefaction of the blood, and the pre&s;ence of &s;anguinous apoplexy, will, no doubt, think this part of our practice unfavourable to the end we have in view, the recovery of the patient,
<PB N="26" REF="26">as it will have a tendency to encrea&s;e the rarefaction of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, and the fluids in general: but they will remem|ber that we thought it more than probable, &s;uch a &s;tate of the fluids did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t us in opening the per&s;pirable pores, diluents and diaphoretics mu&s;t be conjoined; for without a due proportion of diluents we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily force a &s;weat. The principle on which I go, by advi&s;ing &s;weating, is from a &s;uppo&s;ition that the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem has ab&s;orbed part of the Opium, and that it is by this means mixed with the fluids in the ge|neral habit. And as our chief view is to evacuate it as compleatly as po&s;&s;ible, that part of it which has been ab&s;orbed, and which creates a great &s;hare of the &s;ymp|toms, cannot be evacuated by means more effectual than by &s;udorifics.</P>

<P>I NEED not quote the experiments of profe&s;&s;or Monro on this part of my &s;ubject. He is clear that it is taken up by this &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, becau&s;e, among other proofs, both urine and &s;weat &s;mell of it. The heart is a mu&s;cle very irritable. When the Opium is ab&s;orbed, the nerves of its inner &s;urface mu&s;t be affected, becau&s;e it is then applied immediately to them, as well as to the nerves of the in&s;ide of the arteries; and through this medium, as well as through the nerves of the &s;tomach, it mu&s;t induce its peculiar &s;ymptoms. The diaphoretics, that have been gene|rally u&s;ed, were of the warm kind, &s;uch as confect. aromatic. mi&s;tur. camphe|rat. &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>A MAN who &s;wallowed an ounce of L. Laud. within the &s;pace of an hour, in &s;mall punch, recovered by vomits, purg|ing,
<PB N="28" REF="28">bli&s;ters, and &s;weating. And a lady, eighteen years of age, who took the &s;ame quantity, was cured by much the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>A CHILD, of eighteen months old, la|bouring under the hooping cough, had a do&s;e of elix. paregor. given, with the in|tention of moderating the cough; the quan|tity uncertain. It was admini&s;tered at night, and the &s;ymptoms were not no|ticed till next morning, when deep &s;leep and convul&s;ions were ob&s;erved: recovery was here brought about by &s;trong cor|dials. The quantity of the elix. appears not to have been &s;o large as to induce tho&s;e &s;ymptoms that end in &s;peedy death.</P>
<P>Dr. Clark's patient, who in July 1766, &s;wallowed a drachm of &s;olid Opium, was al&s;o cured by vomits, purges, gli&s;ters, and &s;weating. The patient was an adult;
<PB N="29" REF="29">he took half a drachm, and repeated the do&s;e at a &s;hort interval; in the &s;pace of 20 minutes it began to operate.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on, I pre&s;ume, to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;udorifics, &s;ome &s;udorifics, at lea&s;t, blunt the action of Opium. It is well known, that when emetics, neutral &s;alts, and Opium are united, a much larger do&s;e of the Opium may be admini&s;tered with &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s, as a medicine, than when given alone; its action by this ad|dition being modified.</P>
<P>A PROOF of this we have in the com|po&s;ition, commonly known by the name of Dover's &s;weating powder. This is an union of Opium, ipecac: and vitriolated tartar. To a&s;&s;i&s;t then both in modifying the action of the Opium and procuring &s;weat, either ipecac. in powder, or an
<PB N="30" REF="30">antimonial may be employed in warm water, to which a &s;mall quantitiy of a neutral &s;alt may be added; the Opium, being, as we pre&s;ume, already in the &s;to|mach, will form a &s;trong &s;udorific, and thus, part at lea&s;t of the offending matter be converted into an antidote to de&s;troy its own noxious quality, by hurrying it through the circulating fluids, and expel|ling it by the pores of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>SHOULD the patient have lo&s;t the power of deglution, for this has &s;ometimes hap|pened; the&s;e, and the other medicines we have recommended, mu&s;t be forced into the &s;tomach by a &s;mall tube. A woman was killed, as Dr. Al&s;ton relates, by taking a quantity of liniment for the haemorrhoides compo&s;ed of Opium and Myrrh, by mi&s;take for a purge. When the mi&s;take was di&s;|covered, a vomit was given, but though
<PB N="31" REF="31">this was not above three quarters of an hour after the bolus had been taken, &s;he was &s;o convul&s;ed as to have lo&s;t the <HI>power of deglution.</HI> She died in &s;ome hours after. Pul&s;e large, full, and not very fre|quent. When her phy&s;ician fir&s;t &s;aw her, there appeared a pale livor on her cheek, and in other re&s;pects &s;he was like a per|&s;on drunk.</P>
<P>THERE are few &s;urgeons without hol|low bougees; provided nothing more con|venient be at hand, one of the&s;e may be employed to convey the medicines down, e&s;pecially for children, where the ae&s;o|phagus is &s;horter than in the adult.</P>
<P>IF the tube be long enough to pa&s;s be|yond the epgilottis, or the pa&s;&s;age into the lungs, it is all that is requi&s;ite; the liquid, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t drop into the &s;tomach;
<PB N="32" REF="32">and this is no great length, as is well known to tho&s;e who have u&s;ed the probang, in pu&s;hing down, &amp;c. &s;ub&s;tances accident|ly &s;ticking in the throat; or who will take the trouble to examine the di&s;tance be|tween the lower jaw and the top of the &s;ternum, where the trachaea and ae&s;ophagus dip under it.</P>
<P>SEVERAL authors have &s;poken highly in favour of acids, both among the an|tients and moderns, for their power of modifying the noxious effects of Opium; among the&s;e, al&s;o, have been men of much celebrity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wedelius, among&s;t others, &s;trenou&s;ly a&s;&s;erts the u&s;e of acids.</NOTE></P>
<P>To acids Dr. Mead advi&s;es alkaline &s;alts to be added. Dr. Cullen embraces the opinion that acids po&s;&s;e&s;s this power, and he &s;peaks of his having found them &s;o
<PB N="33" REF="33">from his own experience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Another means of weakening the powers of Opium is the application of acids, and we have found this very effectual." Cullen's Mat. Med.</NOTE>. We wi&s;h the Doctor had mentioned the in&s;tances to which he alludes, and the other means which he pur&s;ued at the &s;ame time, as we would then have been more able to deter|mine what &s;hare they exerted, and what might be, at the &s;ame time, attributed to the other methods he pur&s;ued. He does not, however, pretend that it changes the nature of this drug; for when it is given thus in union with Opium, in a large enough quantity, he allows it to have all the &s;ame effects as Opium alone.</P>
<P>Doctor Web&s;ter, an eminent medical teacher, at Edinburgh, and whom I have the honour to rank as one of my pre|ceptors in this &s;cience, has the following
<PB N="34" REF="34">ob&s;ervation, which may be found in his Syllabus. "Acids render the &s;tomach le&s;s capable of being acted on by other matters, as &s;pirits, ale, &amp;c." In the cour&s;e of his lectures, the Doctor enlarges on the ob&s;ervation, by &s;aying, that "the action of Hemlock, Opium, and Ipeca|cuanha, are moderated much by the ad|dition of an acid."</P>
<P>AN ingenious phy&s;ician, who has not long &s;ince made many experiments on this article of the Mat. Med. denies that any &s;uch effects follow. He affirms that acids render the &s;tomach le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the operation of Opium, if given previous to it; but &s;hould the Opium be fir&s;t admi|ni&s;tered, and its effects have began, in any degree, to appear, the acid then cannot le&s;&s;en them.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
<P>HE gave to a boy, of twelve years of age, an ounce of common vinegar; a quarter of an hour after 40 gutts of L. Laud.; in half an hour it produced a &s;e|vere &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach, but no vo|miting. His head now began to be a little affected, but this did not continue long; the pul&s;e remained &s;teady, except when the nau&s;ea appeared; the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;oon went off, and the boy was re&s;tored to his u&s;ual &s;ituation.</P>
<P>To a healthy young man he gave two ounces of the common vegetable acid, and in a quarter of an hour after 80 gutts of T. Opii.; two hours after taking it he complained of a little nau&s;ea and head|ach; the&s;e &s;ymptoms continued only a &s;hort time, when he felt him&s;elf as u&s;ual, except a little &s;ickne&s;s about the &s;tomach. The Doctor could di&s;cover no change in
<PB N="36" REF="36">the pul&s;e what&s;over: he made &s;imilar ex|periments both on dogs and rabbits, and concludes, by &s;aying, "that the Opium &s;eldom had much effect, if an acid was previou&s;ly given."</P>
<P>HE in&s;tituted other experiments both on frogs and dogs; to &s;atisfy him&s;elf farther, how far the acid would act if the Opi|um was given, and had begun to exert its effects before the other was exhi|bited. His conclu&s;ion is this,&mdash;"That the acid, if given after the Opium began to operate, had not the &s;malle&s;t power of correcting its dangerous tendency." Hence it it is plain, if we put any credit in the experiments of this ingenious gentleman, that the &s;uppo&s;ition of acids correcting the deleterious effects of Opium, like many other of the antient theories, has no ex|i&s;tence in reality, and that, we mu&s;t not,
<PB N="37" REF="37">therefore, place our dependance in their u&s;e when the patient is in danger from the noxious powers of Opium, though a different doctrine be &s;upported by great names, both among the antient and modern phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>HOW far diuretics may conduce to the cure I dare not determine. As our great and chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to evacuate the Opium from the habit, and as the urine is found to contain it, which is indicated by its &s;mell, I am inclined to think they may, in their turn, be advantageou&s;ly had recour&s;e to. The di&s;charges by the &s;kin are generally ob&s;erved to le&s;&s;en that by the kidnies; but both, I am per&s;uaded, may be forwarded to a certain degree at the &s;ame time. Di|luents was recommended to keep up a &s;weat; diluents, in plenty, will excite the urinary di&s;charges: to the&s;e may be added
<PB N="38" REF="38">medicines more directly &s;timulating the urinary organs. Par&s;ley tea may be drank; &s;p. aether. nitros. has been generally con&s;ider|ed as having &s;pecific effects on the kidnies.</P>
<P>OTHER methods more effectually for eli|minating this poi&s;on from the human body, I know of none; and I fully believe, where the circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that hopes can be entertained, none other are nece&s;&s;ary. Let me again recommend, however, expedi|tion and diligence in their application. Dr. Willis informs us of a robu&s;t man, who, after taking a large do&s;e of laudanum, was dead in &s;o &s;hort a time as four hours. Others have died in ten, twelve, and &s;ix|teen.</P>
<P>Dr. Leigh gave only five grains to a wo|man, and it threw her into violent con|vul&s;ions; he gave her a few grains of ipe|cucuanha
<PB N="39" REF="39">to remove it, and afterwards 60 gutts of aether; &s;he was not well, how|ever, for two days after. The &s;ame gen|tleman gave to a dog, for an experiment, an ounce di&s;&s;olved in water. In a very &s;hort time it threw him into convul&s;ions, and killed him. We may remark, by the bye, that his &s;tomach was immediately laid open, and the coats attentively examined, but not the &s;malle&s;t marks of inflammation were perceivable; a much le&s;s quantity would mo&s;t undoubtedly have killed him. Dr. Mead gave a quarter of an ounce to a dog, and in &s;o &s;hort a time as a quarter of an hour he began to &s;leep; then was con|vul&s;ed; fell into univer&s;al tremblings; breathed &s;hort and laborious; lo&s;t the u&s;e of both his fore and hind legs; and then, as the Doctor expre&s;&s;es it, "his limbs on a &s;udden grew limber, and he in&s;tantly expired."</P>
<PB N="40" REF="40">
<P>WHEN, unhappily, this drug has been &s;wallowed to this quantity, our fir&s;t enqui|ry &s;hould be, how long it has been in the &s;tomach, and in what form it was admi|ni&s;tered? whether in a liquid, or &s;olid form? whether united with other &s;ub&s;tances, and what the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances were? In a liquid form it is found to exert its effects much &s;ooner than when taken in a &s;olid; and according to the experiments of the Abbe Fontana, in conjunction with &s;pirits, it is the more powerfully deleterious.</P>
<P>Mr. Hender&s;on, the comedian, it has been &s;aid, died in a &s;hort time, by &s;ome mi&s;take in taking Opium; and the &s;ame has been a&s;&s;erted of the late Dr. Brown, who in a &s;tate, it &s;eems, of intoxication, took up|wards of 500 gutts of laudanum, and was found dead next morning. If this be true, it was a new way of taking off the effects
<PB N="41" REF="41" MS="y">of intoxication; if he took it with this intention, it was like adding oil to extin|gui&s;h flame; for Opium and &s;pirituous liquors, in their effects, are very analogous to each other, and the means, in general, that cures the one will cure the other; with this con&s;ideration, that dilution is even <HI>more</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, where &s;pirits have been drank to a dangerous exce&s;s, than when Opium has been taken to the &s;ame extent.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole; if we do not &s;peedily have recour&s;e to emetics and the other means already mentioned; all other efforts, when &s;trong convul&s;ions and apo|plectic &s;ymptoms have taken place, afford but little hopes that life can be &s;aved. If the do&s;e be &s;wallowed from even 15 mi|nutes to 30 minutes, to an hour, accord|ing to the &s;trength and age of the per&s;on, and the quantity taken, its operation may
<PB N="42" REF="42">have already gone &s;uch lengths, and ex|erted its baneful powers &s;o far on the ge|neral &s;y&s;tem, as to render every &s;ucceeding attempt to &s;ave life altogether abortive, even under the management of the mo&s;t active phy&s;icians of &s;teady per&s;everance, and ready thought.</P>

<P>I Am &s;orry I cannot &s;end you a more perfect account of the ca&s;e you re|quire, than that which you will now re|ceive; the girl's name, who was the &s;ub|ject of it, I forget<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her name, as I am told, was Lydia Spratt.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JUNE the 3d, 1787, I was &s;ent for, between &s;ix and &s;even in the morning, to
<PB N="44" REF="44">a &s;ervant girl of a farmer, who lives about four miles from hence. The only in|formation which I received, was, that they could not awake her; accordingly, on my going to her ma&s;ter's, I found her in a deep &s;leep, attended with laborious breath|ing and great &s;weating; knowing that the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e frequently took lau|danum for a complaint in the &s;tomach, I enquired whether the girl might not have taken &s;ome. The phial was accordingly &s;ought for. And mi&s;&s;ing it, upon farther &s;earch, we found it under her pillow, and empty. The phial had been filled the day before, and contained two ounces; therefore, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, we made no doubt but &s;he had taken the whole about eleven o'clock the preceding night. I immediately gave her two &s;cru|ples of ipecacuanha without the lea&s;t ef|fect; &s;he did not &s;eem to have the power
<PB N="45" REF="45">of deglution at any one time, during my attendance, which was four hours; but the fluids which I gave &s;eemed to go down her throat without any effort on her part. She had a florid look, but a languid pul&s;e; however, I bled her about four ounces; I made a large orifice, but the blood came away very &s;lowly, and was very black: I gave her vinegar and brandy, mixed with &s;ome of the &s;pirit: ammon: comp: I likewi&s;e had her well rubbed in different parts of the body with the &s;ame mixture. After we had continued this method about two hours, I had her car|ried into the air, and laid upon a ca&s;k, which we kept moving about; when after all I found &s;he remained in a total in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate, I had her &s;et in a chair, where &s;he remained till &s;he died, which was about another hour. Her breath|ing became more and more laborious; at
<PB N="46" REF="46">the end of every expiration, there &s;eemed to be a total inactivity of the lungs for &s;ome moments, and the &s;ucceeding in&s;piration was long. I &s;hould call her death, a for|getting to breathe. Her eyelids were clo&s;ed all the time, and when lifted up the pupils appeared very much dilated, and not to have the power of contraction.</P>
