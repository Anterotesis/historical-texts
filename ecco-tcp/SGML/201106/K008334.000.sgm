<P>RECEIPTS FOR Preparing and Compounding THE PRINCIPAL MEDICINES Made USE of By the late Mr. <HI>WARD.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>FRIENDSHIP, and perhaps Gratitude, having incited the late Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> of <HI>White|hall,</HI> in his la&s;t Illne&s;s, to order his Book of Medicinal Secrets to be delivered to me, as my Property, in ca&s;e of his Death, I &s;hould think my&s;elf unworthy of a Beque&s;t of this Nature, and made upon &s;uch Honourable Principles, if I was not di&s;po&s;ed to apply it to the Noble&s;t of all Purpo&s;es, <HI>The Common Good of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion I felt, upon the Information I received, of my being made Ma&s;ter of this Book, (valuable for its Contents) although I under&s;tood it to be given to me, as it certainly was, in the mo&s;t Liberal Manner; to be ab&s;olutely at my own Di&s;po&s;al; and without Condition, Di|rection, or Limitation of any kind whatever.</P>
<P>Many and various have been the Thoughts which have occurred to me, and the Opinions I have heard, as to the Be&s;t Method to be taken in order to an&s;wer the Great End I wi&s;hed to accompli&s;h: And many were the Difficulties which pre&s;ented them&s;elves, and encountered the Idea of Di&s;pen&s;ing the Principal Medicines made u&s;e of by Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> under the Direction of a Regularly bred Phy&s;ician, of known Honour and Integrity; as well as That of throwing them open to the World; taking Care,
<PB N="2" REF="3">at the &s;ame time, to have the &s;aid Medicines duly prepared, in the &s;ame manner they u&s;ed to be, and Publickly &s;old, at Prices &s;o moderate, that the lowe&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's indu&s;trious Subjects may have the Benefit of them.</P>
<P>However, as I was inclined to allow Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Executors a Rea&s;onable Time to di&s;po&s;e of the pre|pared Medicines, which became their Property; I had thereby Lei&s;ure to deliberate upon the&s;e two Principal Propo&s;itions. The latter of the two I always &s;tood mo&s;t inclined to adopt.</P>
<P>But vain would have been my Inclination in this Particular, had not His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Benevolent Di&s;po&s;ition and Exten&s;ive Bounty removed an in|&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacle which &s;tood in my Way; by making ample Provi&s;ion for certain Ingenious Chymi&s;ts, who had been employed by Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> the Moment it came to be Humbly repre&s;ented to Him.</P>
<P>By His Maje&s;ty's Royal Bounty, then, the&s;e Men were made willing to give me that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I could not, in Con&s;cience, have otherwi&s;e a&s;ked or expected from them; as it would have been injurious to them&s;elves; and without which I could not have made all the&s;e Medicines known to the World, on account of certain Omi&s;&s;ions and Inaccuracies di&s;covered, upon Examination, in the Book: Since none, but &s;uch as have been em|ployed in making the Chymical Medicines, could give a Clear and Perfect Account of the Proce&s;&s;es which had been actually u&s;ed in the preparing of them.</P>
<P>Having pre&s;umed to &s;uppo&s;e that what I have, by His Maje&s;ty's Bounty, been enabled to do; and am now, in con&s;equence thereof, going to do, will prove Beneficial to Mankind in general, it may be thought rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onable that I &s;hould inform the Publick
<PB N="3" REF="4">upon what Foundation I rai&s;e my Expectation of &s;eeing &s;o happy an Effect re&s;ulting from it.</P>
<P>It is, &s;hortly, this. I knew the late Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> before he began to admini&s;ter Medicines; and, when he did, I re&s;ided there for a con&s;ider|able Time, at different Periods. I had attention to the Operation and Effects of them there; as well as here, when their Reputation had opened his Way to his Native Country.</P>
<P>I took his Emetic Drop and Sweats my&s;elf, a|bove Thirty Years ago; and at a time when I was reduced (by a Complication of Di&s;orders, occa&s;ion|ed by my Stomach having lo&s;t the Power of <HI>di|ge&s;ting</HI> properly the mo&s;t &s;imple Food) to &s;o low and wretched a State, both in Body and Spirits, that tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand mo&s;t, and knew me be&s;t, looked upon me as pa&s;t all Hope of Recovery.</P>
<P>To the U&s;e of the&s;e Medicines, under God, I always thought I owed the happy Removal of the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of all my Di&s;orders. I have often given them, with Succe&s;s, in my own Family; and, at times, to that part of it which &s;at neare&s;t my Heart: I have encouraged many to apply them|&s;elves to Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> in very &s;trong Ca&s;es: I have di&s;tributed his Medicines to the Afflicted, in vari|ous Di&s;orders, which he u&s;ed to give me for that Purpo&s;e: And I can wind up all I have &s;aid upon this Head with averring to the Publick, that I my|&s;elf never, as far as I can recollect, knew any Per|&s;on, excepting one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Per&s;on here referred to, had great Pains in the Body; and took Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Sweating Powders Thirty-two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nights; taking &s;ometimes half, &s;ometimes three Quarters of a Do&s;e, which brought on a Weakne&s;s, of which this Per&s;on complained: But this &s;eems to have been owing to the Quantity of the&s;e Powders, taken in &s;o &s;hort a time, and not to their Quality.</NOTE>, who thought him&s;elf hurt by taking, or di&s;&s;atisfied for having taken Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s
<PB N="4" REF="5">Medicines; on the contrary, I have known many Great, and Radical Cures effected upon tho&s;e of my Acquaintance who have taken them, in the Space of more than Thirty Years; and that, without com|plaining of the <HI>Medicines for their Manner of Ope|rating.</HI></P>
<P>When I have &s;aid this, no one will wonder that I not only hope, but pre&s;ume to expect that the Publication of the&s;e Medicines, and cau&s;ing them to be &s;old at very low Prices, will prove Beneficial to Mankind; whatever &s;ome may think, who&s;e Minds remain warped by Prejudice; or others may &s;ay, who&s;e Intere&s;t, perhaps, may have prompted them to infu&s;e tho&s;e Prejudices.</P>
<P>To the former of the&s;e I cannot help &s;aying, I &s;hould wonder extremely (if Time and Ob&s;ervation had not &s;hewed me the great Force of Prejudice) that any &s;trong Su&s;picion &s;hould &s;till remain of the&s;e Medicines being Dangerous, when taken in proper Quantities, and under proper Regulations, now that all the World knows they have been gaining Ground and Reputation for &s;o many Years, only by the Force of their own Acts; notwith&s;tanding they had to break their way through the &s;trong Barriers of Intere&s;t, Prejudice and Ridicule.</P>
<P>To the latter I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the Medicines I am <HI>now</HI> going to make Publick are &s;uch as have been mo&s;tly applied to Ca&s;es called Chronical; and, generally, to &s;uch as were of Old-&s;tanding, before the Sufferers under them would con&s;ult Mr. <HI>Ward:</HI> And if, in the &s;ame &s;ort of Ca&s;es, they &s;hould hereafter be taken, <HI>without waiting &s;o long,</HI> I hope the Gentlemen of the Faculty, e&s;pecially the Can|did and Re&s;pectable, will not &s;et up an Oppo|&s;ition to them, and endeavour to di&s;courage the Middling and Lower Sort of People from taking what will co&s;t &s;o little, and probably do them a great deal of Good.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>In this rea&s;onable Hope, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall not be di&s;appointed: Yet, if that &s;hould happen to be the Ca&s;e, I &s;hall be &s;ure of their Approbation for one certain Effect of this Publication; (and which, indeed, was a great Motive to it) &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Practice of Ignorant Pretenders to the Know|ledge of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s <HI>Secrets;</HI> and thereby prevent|ing the Mi&s;chiefs which would otherwi&s;e be done by &s;uch Bold Practitioners di&s;pen&s;ing, under the Name of the&s;e Excellent Medicines&mdash;One knows not What.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trouble the Publick no farther, now, upon this Subject, in general; but proceed to give the Genuine Receipts for making each Particular Me|dicine; &s;pecifying the Do&s;es, and the &s;everal Di&s;|orders to which they have been u&s;ually applied, ac|cording to my Ob&s;ervation, and the be&s;t Informa|tion I have been yet able to obtain.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Method of preparing Antimony, for the PILL and DROP.</HEAD>
<P>PROVIDE your&s;elf with an Earthen un-glazed Pan, that will hold three or four Quarts; &s;et it on a naked Fire, and have in readine&s;s, of the fine&s;t and pure&s;t crude Antimony, as much as you plea&s;e; (that which appears in long &s;hining Needles, and is the ea&s;ie&s;t powdered, is the be&s;t; being mo&s;t free from metallic, or other heterogeneous Bodies) pow|der it indifferently fine; put ten or twelve Ounces into your Pan, &s;tirring it continually with an Iron Spatula, and increa&s;ing your Fire till it &s;ends forth white Fumes, and a Flame like burning Brim&s;tone: Continue that Degree of Fire, continually &s;tirring, till it burns or fumes no more; but is become a grey or a&s;h-coloured Powder. If it &s;hould melt,
<PB N="6" REF="7">and run into Lumps, in the Beginning of your Ope|ration, you mu&s;t take it out of your Pan, and pound it again; putting it in again, and &s;tirring as before, till it be thoroughly calcined. Then put in four Ounces more of your crude Matter; proceeding as before, and continuing &s;o to do, till you have as much as you de&s;ire. By this Method you will cal|cine your Antimony with much le&s;s Labour and Time, than in doing it all together, as is u&s;ual: For, by putting your crude Antimony to your cal|cined, its melting will be prevented, and the Fumes will fly off much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>[<HI>N. B.</HI> It mu&s;t be done in a Chimney; other|wi&s;e the Fumes will be hurtful to the Operator.]</P>
<P>Take a clean Crucible, which will hold about a Quart; put into it about two Pounds of your cal|cined Antimony; &s;et it in a melting Furnace, and make a gradual Fire under it; put Coals nearly to the Top of your Crucible; keep it in a moderate Fu&s;ion, &s;ometimes &s;tirring it about with an Iron Rod: Care mu&s;t be taken that your Fire be not too violent, while your Matter is in Fu&s;ion; or it will liquify it to &s;uch a Degree, and render it &s;o &s;ubtle, that it will all run through the Pores of your Crucible, into your A&s;h-hole; not leaving one &s;ingle Drop, or Grain behind.</P>
<P>When you find your Matter, which adheres to your Rod, tran&s;parent and bright (which it will be, in about half an Hour after it is in Fu&s;ion, if you have kept a proper Degree of Fire) have, in readi|ne&s;s, a &s;mooth Marble Stone, well dried, and heated as hot as you can bear your Hand upon it; for fear your hot Matter &s;hould break it. [It will be pro|per to have an Iron Curb round your Marble, to ri&s;e half or three Quarters of an Inch above its Sur|face, to prevent your Matter from running off.] Pour your vitrified Matter upon your Stone; and if you have any more of your calcined Matter, put
<PB N="7" REF="8">your Crucible again into the Fire; put in more, and proceed as before. If your Crucible is good, and your Fire moderately governed, you may u&s;e the &s;ame Crucible five or &s;ix times; as I, my&s;elf, have frequently done</P>
<P>Thus have you <HI>a fair and pure Gla&s;s of Anti|mony,</HI> of a light red Colour.</P>
<P>As I have been informed that mo&s;t, if not all the Gla&s;s of Antimony, u&s;ed in this kingdom, is im|ported; and that the erroneous Proce&s;s, in making it, is al&s;o introduced here; I &s;hall make the follow|ing Ob&s;ervation upon it.</P>
<P>As the Gla&s;s of Antimony, u&s;ed here, is made abroad, we cannot be competent Judges whether it is made of pure Antimony, or &s;uch as may be mixt with other heterogeneous Matter. I have al&s;o ob|&s;erved, that keeping the Crucible covered, during the time of its Fu&s;ion, both hinders the Vitrification, and makes the Gla&s;s le&s;s pure, by preventing the remaining combu&s;tible Parts of the Antimony from flying off.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>The <HI>Pill and Drop</HI> are made as follows.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE, of the afore&s;aid Gla&s;s of Antimony, as much as you plea&s;e; Pound it in a clean Iron Mortar, and &s;ift it through a fine Lawn Sieve; then grind, or levigate it, on a &s;mooth Marble Stone, to an impalpable Powder. Take al&s;o Dragon's Blood, dried and powdered. To four Ounces of your levigated Gla&s;s, put one Ounce of this Dra|gon's Blood; grind them very well together; and with good Sack, or rich Mountain Wine, make into a Ma&s;s for Pills, of about One Grain and half each, which is a full Do&s;e for a Man or Woman.</P>
<P>The Drop, &s;o called, is made by putting about half an Ounce of your levigated Gla&s;s of Antimony into a Quart of the riche&s;t <HI>Malaga</HI> Mountain, or
<PB N="8" REF="9">Sack. Shake them well together, and let them &s;tand two or three Days to &s;ettle, and grow clear. Then pour it off gently, to be quite fine.</P>
<P>The full Do&s;e (half an Ounce) is for a Man, or Woman: But be&s;t to begin with the half or two thirds; according to Age or Strength of Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Common Gla&s;s of Antimony, as &s;old at the Shops, though reckoned a very rough Medicine, is, I find, pre&s;cribed in Di&s;pen&s;atories from Two to Eight Grains: Therefore I &s;hall make the following Ob|&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As I have made large Quantities of Gla&s;s of Antimony, for Mr. <HI>Ward;</HI> &s;o I find a very e&s;&s;ential Difference between what I made by the foregoing Proce&s;s, and what I have bought in the Shops: Mine being of a brighter Red, much &s;ofter, and not &s;o har&s;h and gritty in the Pulveri&s;a|tion, and Levigation: Whence I imagine, that the Gla&s;s of Antimony <HI>imported,</HI> is not prepared from <HI>pure Antimony,</HI> or <HI>not genuinely prepared.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I apprehend that, where it has been pre&s;cribed, and given inwardly, it has only been powdered and &s;ifted; whereby it is not reduced to the Hundredth Part of the <HI>Finene&s;s</HI> to which it is brought by the afore&s;aid <HI>Levigation,</HI> if duly per|formed. It is well known to the Learned in Chy|mi&s;try, that, by <HI>Trituration</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Quincy</HI>'s Di&s;pen&s;atory, on <HI>Trituration,</HI> Page 10, 11 Ed. 1736.</NOTE>, &s;everal rough Bo|dies may be rendered &s;oft and &s;mooth: corro&s;ive Mercury, by repeated Operations, is changed from a violent Poi&s;on, to a &s;afe Medicine, frequently pre|&s;cribed, even for Children. I have found, by Ex|perience, that the <HI>Pill</HI> and <HI>Drop</HI> is a &s;afe and very efficacious Medicine, when prepared, as before directed.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<P>I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that, by <HI>Grinding</HI> and <HI>Incorporating</HI> the vitrified Antimony with the Dra|gon's Blood, which is a Bal&s;amic Gum, the Medicine is rendered &s;till more <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>&s;mooth.</HI></P>
<P>Atte&s;ted <HI>December</HI> 1, 1762, by me, <HI>JOHN WHITE.</HI></P>
<P>The Pill and Drop were the two fir&s;t Medicines which Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> admini&s;tred at <HI>Paris;</HI> and were, to the be&s;t of my Remembrance, the Principal Things made u&s;e of, when he fir&s;t returned from thence to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were in 1736, attacked in a Printed Pam|phlet, by Mr. <HI>Jo&s; Clutton,</HI> Apothecary and Chy|mi&s;t; who, <HI>being hone&s;tly concerned for the Publick Good</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Preface, Pag. 3.</NOTE>, told the World he had di&s;covered the Com|ponent Parts of the Pill to be <HI>Red Ar&s;enic and Gla&s;s of Antimony, equal Parts; with about one &s;ixteenth Part of Calcined Cobalt</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pamphlet, Pag. 108.</NOTE></P>
<P>This he pretended to have proved, with &s;o much Plau&s;ibility; and rea&s;oned upon the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed Proof</HI> with &s;o much real Art, and &s;eeming Sincerity, that he had well nigh &s;unk the Credit of the&s;e Medicines: For Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> could only <HI>deny</HI> what was <HI>averred</HI> upon pretended Chymical Demon&s;tration; unle&s;s he would have declared his Secret; which was, at once, depriving him&s;elf of all future Benefit from it, as this <HI>Candid</HI> Writer well knew.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Truth prevails, as it generally does &s;ooner or later: And it is now known to the Pub|lick, that there was neither the lea&s;t Particle of Ar&s;enic nor Cobalt in the Compo&s;ition of the&s;e Medicines, which I have &s;o often &s;een taken, with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing Succe&s;s, in various Ca&s;es, that I am
<PB N="10" REF="11">convinced Gla&s;s of Antimony, duly prepared, and given in proper Quantities, will often prove a Re|medy in Ca&s;es which may baffle the Skill of the able&s;t Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Wherefore I hope tho&s;e Gentlemen will pardon my Pre&s;umption, if I venture to recommend it to their &s;erious Attention, and wi&s;h them to make Ex|periments upon &s;ome of their Ho&s;pital Patients, in de&s;perate and perplexing Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>To encourage them thereto, and farther to apo|logize for the Liberty I have taken, I proceed to re|late the following Facts.</P>
<P>In the Year 1733, being then in the Country with my Family, my Hou&s;ekeeper, from forty to fifty Years of Age, had long complained of Indi|ge&s;tions, Reachings, at &s;ome times Sickne&s;s, and at others Pains in her Stomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which &s;he took the u&s;ual Remedies, and was &s;ometimes bet|ter &s;ometimes wor&s;e, for what &s;he took; but the greate&s;t Relief &s;he found, from the be&s;t Advice to be had at <HI>Newbury,</HI> was very tran&s;ient; and her Di&s;order increa&s;ed until &s;he became, as they call it, <HI>very bad indeed.</HI> This inclined her to venture upon One of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Pills; which had no other Ef|fect than that of a <HI>Vomit;</HI> and, by clearing her Stomach, &s;eemed to have wrought a perfect Cure. However I remember that I advi&s;ed her to take a &s;econd Pill, in about a Fortnight or three Weeks. It did not operate near &s;o much as the fir&s;t, the of|fending Matter being greatly dimini&s;hed, but e&s;ta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;hed the Cure: For &s;he lived with me &s;everal Years afterwards, without any Complaints of that Nature.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, a Man-Servant of mine had frequent Complaints in his Bowels; to which, he &s;aid, he had been long &s;ubject. At length he grew very ill, the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;eeming to be ob&s;tructed, and he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of a Stool. Under
<PB N="11" REF="12">the&s;e Circum&s;tances, I gave him one of the&s;e Pills, which very &s;oon relieved him; for it moved him <HI>downwards,</HI> and carried off his Pains. I do not remember to have heard him complain, during &s;ome Months, which he afterwards remained in my Service.</P>
<P>The Third, and la&s;t Ca&s;e I &s;hall mention, is that of a woman-Servant, at the &s;ame time in my Fa|mily. She was confined to her Bed, by violent Rheumatick Pains all over her body. I gave her this Pill, having before &s;een very extraordinary good Effects from it, in Rheumatick Ca&s;es. It cau&s;ed her to <HI>&s;weat</HI> profu&s;ely, for &s;everal Hours; during which time &s;he &s;aid &s;he felt little Workings in the Leg mo&s;t affected; and, in a few Days, &s;he was able to do her Bu&s;ine&s;s about the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e three Particular Ca&s;es, only to &s;hew, that, in my own Hou&s;e, and in a very &s;hort Space of Time, this Pill cured three People of Com|plaints very different in their Nature, by as many different, though proper Operations. From whence, and other In&s;tances, which I have &s;een, I am in|clined to think, that the Nature of Antimony, thus prepared, is to work &s;afely upon vicious Humours in the Body; to carry them off by the proper Channels; and to remove Ob&s;tructions, in &s;ome Degree, if not totally, wherever it meets with them. But if it meets with neither Ob&s;tructions to remove, nor bad Humours to work upon, it pa&s;&s;es quietly through the Body, without giving it the lea&s;t Di&s;|turbance; as I have known it do, in the Shape of the&s;e Pills, after taking three or four of them, with|in a Month; and even the fir&s;t time when taken, by a Per&s;on in perfect Health; which Fact I &s;aw verified, by a Gentleman who took one of them in Contempt of its Size<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are few Medicines which will bear the Change of Climate, the Damps and Clo&s;ene&s;s of a Ship in long Voyages: Whereas the&s;e Pills neither &s;uffer by Time, nor tho&s;e Altera|tions; and there is &s;carce a Remedy applicable to &s;o many Di&s;|orders; as is &s;ufficiently evinced by the Ca&s;es above-mentioned; At the &s;ame Time that the Cheapne&s;s of them will render an Experiment very ea&s;y, to Seafaring Men.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, (to deal Candidly, in all Re&s;pects) I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it is not advi&s;eable, according to my Information, to admin&s;ter the&s;e Pills in Ca&s;es wherein the Vi&s;cera or Inwards are judged to be unfound.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid a great deal upon the&s;e Pills; and more, perhaps, than may be thought Prudent, tho' True: But as my View is, what I at fir&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ed, to promote the common Good of Mankind; the Object is too great, and I am too much in Ear|ne&s;t in the Pur&s;uit, to &s;uppre&s;s Truth; or my Opi|nion, founded upon Truth; although the Cau|tious may impeach my Under&s;tanding; and the Intere&s;ted may Ridicule it.</P>
<P>The DROP, &s;o called, (though not with &s;trict Propriety, as appears from the Manner of pre|paring it) has been u&s;ually given in Di&s;orders oc|ca&s;ioned by foul Stomachs, and Indige&s;tion. It generally operates as an Emetick, as it did with me; yet, &s;ometimes, it moves both ways; as does the Pill. They both make the Patient Sick, very much like Sea-Sickne&s;s, for a &s;hort time be|fore the Di&s;charge, if <HI>upwards,</HI> and the Stomach be loaded with a great quantity of very foul Mat|ter; but not otherwi&s;e. If the Stomach be thus foul, the putting the Matter into Motion mu&s;t Occa&s;ion Sickne&s;s, in proportion to its Quantity, and Quality; but it came from me, and I have &s;een it do the &s;ame in Others, with more Ea&s;e, and le&s;s Straining than is ocea&s;ioned by the Emeticks u&s;ually given.</P>
<P>With this Medicine it is not nece&s;&s;ary to drink large Quantities, to Gorge the Stomach. Half a
<PB N="13" REF="14">Pint of Warm Water, or thin Gruel, when the Sickne&s;s comes on, may generally &s;uffice. When that is come away, and the Reaching over, for that time; half a Pint more may be taken; going on thus, till the Sickne&s;s returns no more.</P>
<P>I have taken about three of the&s;e Emetick Drops, treating them in the Manner above de|&s;cribed; and don't remember that any of them worked more than &s;ix times; not always &s;o often; yet they may work oftener, where the Peccant Matter, to be brought away, is more Abun|dant.</P>
<P>The full Do&s;e, in which it will be made up and &s;old, is for a Man, or Woman.</P>
<P>For young Per&s;ons, it mu&s;t be proportioned to the re&s;pective Age and Strength of each Individual. Even full Grown People, if of Weakly Con&s;titu|tions, may abate of the full Quantity, for the fir&s;t Time, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The chief Object before me in Publi&s;hing the&s;e Receipts, being, as I have &s;aid, Promoting the Com|mon Good of Mankind; I &s;hould act very incon|&s;i&s;tently with that Profe&s;&s;ion, if I was not explicit upon this Important Subject.</P>
<P>Upon this Principle, I think my&s;elf obliged to inform the Publick that the Book, left me by the late Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ed to contain full and clear Receipts for preparing <HI>all</HI> the Medicines he made U&s;e of) does not, upon Examination, fully an&s;wer that End.</P>
<P>What the Omi&s;&s;ions and Inaccuracies are to be imputed to, I am not able to determine. All I know is, that &s;ome few Receipts are not yet found in this Book; and &s;ome Alterations, if not Mi|&s;takes, appear in the Entry of Others. However, by the Help of the Chymi&s;ts employed by Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> and other Information, I have been enabled
<PB N="14" REF="15">to get tho&s;e Defects &s;upplied and rectified, to my Sa|tisfaction; as far as this Publication extends.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the Receipts for pre|paring the two Original Medicines, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pill and Drop, are as yet no where di&s;covered in the Book: But Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> has owned to me, that the principal Ingredient in them is <HI>Antimony,</HI> prepared in a particular manner: Every Circum&s;tance attend|ing their Operation, I am told, confirms it; and Mr. <HI>White</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>White</HI> is the Ingenious Chymi&s;t, who carried on the Great Vitriol Works, at <HI>Twickenbam,</HI> for Mr. <HI>Ward;</HI> and was employed by him in other Chymical Preparations.</NOTE>, (per&s;uaded that <HI>Gla&s;s of Antimony,</HI> prepared by him, for Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> was the <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> Ingredient made u&s;e of in the&s;e Medicines) a&s;&s;ures me, that he has long made and admini&s;tered them in his Family, &amp;c. and upon a Compari&s;on as well of their Operation, as Analization, he found them, at that time, to an&s;wer exactly to tho&s;e made by Mr. <HI>Ward.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and Others which I forbear to mention, I have no Doubt that the above Re|ceipts point at the Genuine and Be&s;t Manner of pre|paring the Pill and Drop.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>The true and genuine Method of preparing the <HI>WHITE DROP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>POUND and brui&s;e fourteen Pounds of the Cleane&s;t Copperas into a Rough Powder; then dry it, with a very gentle Heat, &s;preading it thin, till it becomes a dry and &s;ubtile Powder, to appear|ance like Quick Lime, only much Whiter. [Care mu&s;t be taken, at the Beginning of the drying, that the Heat be very moderate; otherwi&s;e it will melt, and &s;hut up the Pores of the Copperas, and greatly injure your future Operation.]</P>
<PB N="15" REF="16">
<P>When your Copperas is thus become dry and &s;ubtle (which may be done in about 6 or 7 Days) weigh it, and take an equal Quantity of good and clean Rough Nitre, or Salt Petre, which let al&s;o be tolerably dry. Pound your Nitre and dried Copperas together, and &s;ift them through an in|differently fine Hair Sieve: Then put them into a large Gla&s;s Retort, coated at the Bottom, and &s;et it in a Sand Furnace: Let not your Retort be above an Inch from the Bottom and Sides of your Sand-Pan: Fix on a very large Receiver, and lute it; but leave a &s;mall Vent-hole in the Joint, by &s;ticking in the Point of a &s;mall Skewer, to let out the Wind, (which will i&s;&s;ue from the Matter at the fir&s;t making of your Fire) by drawing it out, and putting it in as you &s;hall &s;ee Occa&s;ion, to prevent your Retort or Receiver's bur&s;ting. Make a gen|tle Fire for the fir&s;t three or four Hours; then in|crea&s;e it, gradually, for four Hours longer, till your Iron Pan be Red at Bottom: Continue your Fire for about thirty Hours; then let it out, and when all is cool, you will have a mo&s;t powerful <HI>Aqua For|tis.</HI> Put it into a Bottle, and &s;top it clo&s;e: let it &s;tand &s;ix or eight Days (the longer the better) to dige&s;t it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Put this <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> into a Gla&s;s Retort; let it be about half, or two Thirds full; &s;et it in your Sand-heat, and fix on a Receiver, which need not be very large: Make an indifferent Fire, till all your <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> is come over into your Receiver; leaving behind only a Brown Reddi&s;h Earth, which was forced over, by the Violence of the Fire, in the fir&s;t Di&s;tillation. Thus have you a mo&s;t &s;trong and pure <HI>Aqua Fortis.</HI></P>
<P>[As I have never been able to procure any <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> proper for making the &s;aid Drops, but what I made my&s;elf; I have here &s;et down a true and full Proce&s;s for making it.]</P>
<PB N="16" REF="17">
<P>Take of your rectified <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> as much as you plea&s;e; put it into a large Bolt-head, with a long Neck, but not above a Quarter full. Then take, of the pure&s;t and fine&s;t Volatile Sal Armo|niac, in which there is not the lea&s;t Acid Salt, or Lime.</P>
<P>[As I have u&s;ually bought this Volatile Salt ready made, and doubt not but it may be had pure and genuine at Apothecary's Hall, I have omitted here &s;etting down the Proce&s;s for making it; having bought it of Mr. <HI>Godfrey,</HI> Chymi&s;t.]</P>
<P>To &s;ixteen Ounces of the afore&s;aid <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> in your Bolt-head, take &s;even Ounces of the &s;aid Volatile Sal Armoniac; and, by half an Ounce at a time, put it into your Bolt-head, to your <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> immediately &s;topping the Mouth of your Bolt-head, till the Fermentation is over; yet not &s;o clo&s;e, but to leave &s;ome &s;mall Vent, for fear the Wind, cau&s;ed by the violent Fermentation, &s;hould bur&s;t your Gla&s;s. When all your Sal Armoniac is in, let it &s;tand two or three Hours, till the Fumes are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>&rindx; [N. B. This is the Right and exact Propor|tion; if your Operations in making your <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> are rightly performed; and your <HI>Volatil Sal Armoniac</HI> be good and pure.]</P>
<P>Now put it into a &s;maller Bolt-head, half full, and &s;et it in a moderate Sand-heat; when it is warm, put in four Ounces of the fine&s;t <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> to each Pound (of &s;ixteen Ounces) of your Solu|tion; and let it &s;tand, in that Heat, till all the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> is di&s;&s;olved. Increa&s;e your Fire a little, and put in a &s;mall Quantity more of <HI>Quick&s;ilver;</HI> thus letting it di&s;&s;olve, by gentle Additions, as much as it will. When it will di&s;&s;olve no more, take it out of the Bolt-head, put it into an open Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;el, or a large White Stone Bowl. [I ge|nerally cut off a large Gla&s;s Body in the Middle.]
<PB N="17" REF="18">Set it in a Moderate Sand-heat, and let it evapo|rate till a Pellicle or Skin comes over the Top of it. Then take it from the Fire, and let it &s;tand in a cool Place to congeal. [Great Care mu&s;t be taken, that your Heat be not too great in your Evaporation; nor continued too long; or it would coagulate, and mix the corro&s;ive Oil (which is to be poured off after its Congealment) with the fine pure Salt; and quite &s;poil the Medicine.]</P>
<P>There will remain, uncongealed, a Heavy Li|quor, or Oil, which pour off, and let it drain, until no more will run or drop from it. Take the remaining Salt, put it into a Gla&s;s Body, and to each Pound (&s;ixteen Ounces) put Three Pounds of the fine&s;t Ro&s;e Water; &s;topping the Mouth of your Body, by tying over it a Piece of doubled brown Paper. Set it again in your Sand-heat; make an indifferently hot Fire, till all your Salt is di&s;&s;olved; which is u&s;ually done in 24 Hours.</P>
<P>Thus the WHITE DROP is prepared.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>This Medicine, thus rendered extremely Mild, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be accounted Dangerous; &s;eeing that, in the Do&s;e of two Drops, u&s;ually taken in 24 Hours, the Quantity of Mercury does not amount to Half a Grain.</P>
<P>Atte&s;ted <DATE><HI>December</HI> 1&s;t, 1762,</DATE> by me <HI>JOHN WHITE.</HI></P>
<P>This WHITE DROP was wholly and con&s;tantly prepared by Mr. <HI>White,</HI> for Mr. <HI>Ward.</HI> I, who am neither Chymi&s;t nor Phy&s;ician, do not pre|tend to &s;ay any Thing as to the Nature of this excellent Anti&s;corbutic Medicine; and, therefore, &s;hall confine my&s;elf, merely, to its Effects; which,
<PB N="18" REF="19">under my Eye, have been very Extraordinary, in the &s;everal Stages of that Di&s;temper; and, even, where the Patients have been &s;uppo&s;ed to derive their Di&s;orders from their Parents.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e; and, as I am thoroughly convinced that the&s;e Drops are a mo&s;t Excellent, perhaps the greate&s;t known Anti&s;corbutick, and be&s;t Purifier of the Blood; &s;o, I cannot help flat|tering my&s;elf with a Hope, that they would be a great Pre&s;ervative again&s;t that fatal Di&s;temper, which de&s;troys, in a Year, &s;o many of our brave Seamen; and often occa&s;ions National Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointments, in the mo&s;t important Under|takings.</P>
<P>The Method I would propo&s;e is, that they be given to the Seamen, under proper Direction, from the time of their &s;ailing upon long Voyages: And I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h &s;ome Experiments, of this kind, may be made of them; as I am per&s;uaded that they may be tried without the lea&s;t Hazard; and the Expence too trifling to be mentioned as an Objection.</P>
<P>For if they prove Succe&s;sful, and an&s;wer the End hereby propo&s;ed, and hoped for; it will be Happy for the Publick; for the valuable Indivi|duals; and for Me, who have pre&s;umed to re|commend the Experiment.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="20">
<P>It appears, at fir&s;t View, that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> mu&s;t have made a Mi&s;take in ordering Nitre and Vi|triolated Tartar to be fulminated together: For Vitriolated Tartar will not fulminate with Nitre: Wherefore I apprehend that the Manner in which tho&s;e Ingredients are to be prepared, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Take four Ounces of Refined Nitre, and the &s;ame Quantity of Vitriolated Tartar. Rub them together, in a Mortar, into a Powder. Take a Crucible, (not of the blue Sort) &s;et it in the Fire; and when it begins to be Red, put in about Half of your Nitre and Tartar; &s;tirring it about with an Iron Rod. There will ari&s;e Red Fumes; which take care to avoid, for they are Noxious. When the Red Fumes cea&s;e, put in the Remainder of your Matter, &s;tirring it as before, till no more Fumes ari&s;e.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Ipecacuanha mu&s;t be pickt of &s;uch a Sort as will break ea&s;ily; and not of the Tough Woody Sort.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Powders are thus prepared, they &s;hould be &s;pread thin upon White Stone Di&s;hes, and &s;et in a Cool Place, for about two Days; mixing them very well together, and &s;preading them again, twice a-day: Then dry them before the Fire, or &s;ome gentle Heat.</P>

<HEAD>SWEATING POWDERS, N^o. II.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE Common Tartar, and Refined Nitra, each one Pound; fulminate them together in a Crucible, or Iron Pot; which will reduce them
<PB N="20" REF="21">to about fifteen Ounces, after the Fulmination. To the&s;e add of White Hellebore, and Liquorice Powder, each &s;ix Ounces; of Opium five Ounces. Powder all the&s;e together; and &s;ift them through a fine Lawn Sieve.</P>
<P>Do&s;e, from Twenty-five to Fifty Grains,</P>
<P>For, <HI>it is to be ob&s;erved,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> advi&s;ed &s;uch of his Patients, as had never taken any of his Sweats, to begin with half a Paper only, (con|taining the full Do&s;e) and to increa&s;e the Quan|tity, or not, according to its Operation, or the Age and Strength of the Patient.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Sweating Powders, from what I have &s;een and felt, are, in my Opinion, the mo&s;t Excellent of all Sweats, for removing <HI>Rheumatic,</HI> and other Pains, occa&s;ioned by Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>They generally rai&s;e plentiful Sweats; the Pa|tient drinking moderately, now and then, &s;ome|thing Warm. They do not fatigue the Body, nor exhau&s;t the Spirits. In&s;tead of being re&s;tle&s;s, as is commonly the Ca&s;e in a Sweat, all tho&s;e who can bear Opiates, find them&s;elves comfortably at Ea&s;e, during the Sweat. Tho&s;e, with whom Opiates do not perfectly agree, need not be afraid of the fir&s;t of the&s;e Sweats: For though I cannot bear even Venice Treacle, or Diacodium, on ac|count of their Narcotic Quality; yet I have taken the&s;e Powders, without finding that Inconvenience. This, I am told, is to be attributed to the Correct|ing Ingredients, and the Manner of preparing and compounding them. Whether tho&s;e, who have informed me, Rea&s;on ju&s;tly or not, is not my Province to determine: But the Fact, in regard to my&s;elf, is &s;trictly True.</P>
<P>I have &s;een One of the&s;e Sweats re&s;tore a Limb rendered almo&s;t U&s;ele&s;s, by a Paralytic Di&s;order: And, in <HI>Rheumatic Ca&s;es,</HI> Cures performed, where
<PB N="21" REF="22">the U&s;e of all the Limbs had been quite taken away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> always advi&s;ed tho&s;e who took <HI>The&s;e,</HI> and all Sweats, to put them&s;elves rather between <HI>Blankets</HI> than Sheets; which I have experienced to be the mo&s;t agreeable Way, notwith&s;tanding a lit|tle Prejudice again&s;t trying the Experiment.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e Receipts is taken from Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book; and I do believe it to be his fir&s;t Manner of making them, and what he con|tinued to give for &s;ome Years: For I remember his telling me (when I related to him the Sen&s;ations I felt during their Operation) that there was Opium and Ipecacuanha in them.</P>
<P>Yet I am of Opinion that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> has, in &s;ome Degree, departed from his <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Manner; and made them according to the <HI>Latter Receipt:</HI> For I am credibly informed, that they have been &s;o made, and &s;old, &s;ince his Death; excepting in the Quantity of Opium; of which there are three Eighths le&s;s in this Receipt, than was put into the Powders &s;o made and &s;old. This Alteration is made, upon hearing that tho&s;e, who took them, complained of the Effects of &s;o large a Quantity of Opium. However, I believe that Both are very good, with this Abatement of that Ingredient in the Latter: And, therefore, Care will be taken that Both the&s;e Sweats be prepared, and &s;old: Where|by the Tryal may be made, and the Preference given to <HI>That</HI> which &s;hall be found mo&s;t agreeable to each re&s;pective Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Powders &s;eems to be mo&s;t proper for tho&s;e who have not been u&s;ed to take <HI>Opiates,</HI> or have found them to di&s;agree; (as they, in general, do with me) and the <HI>Latter</HI> for &s;uch, with whom they are known to agree: For there &s;till remains (notwith&s;tanding the beforementioned Abatement) a larger Quantity of Opium in the
<PB N="22" REF="23"><HI>Latter,</HI> than in the <HI>Former</HI> of the&s;e two Re|ceipts.</P>
<P>By Way of Experiment, I prevailed on a Per|&s;on to take one of the <HI>Latter</HI> Sweats, charged with the full Quantity of Opium; (that is, three Eighths more than in the above Receipt) and he told me that it affected his Head very much.</P>
<P>At a proper Interval he took one of tho&s;e, ac|cording to the fir&s;t Receipt; and a&s;&s;ured me that <HI>Both</HI> &s;weated him very well; but the <HI>Former</HI> much more agreeably than the <HI>Latter.</HI></P>

<P>TAKE a Pound of Alicampane Root; Three Pounds of Fennil Seeds, and One Pound of Black Pepper. Pound the&s;e &s;eparately, and &s;ift them through a fine Sieve.

<P>Atte&s;ted by me, <HI>F. J. D'OSTERMAN.</HI></P>
<P>As to this Fi&s;tula Pa&s;te, it is not above Twelve Years &s;ince Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> fir&s;t made u&s;e of it; and it has happened, that but one of my Acquaintance has been afflicted with this Wretched Complaint. He was under Sentence for Cutting; and was to have
<PB N="23" REF="24">been Cut, had not a &s;udden, and &s;evere Fro&s;t hin|dered the Operation. In the mean Time, the Gen|tleman (hearing that I had &s;poken of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Medicine, which cured many of this Di&s;temper, when the Operation had failed) &s;ent to me to en|quire whether what he had heard was true; and whether I thought he had a Chance of being re|lieved by Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> without undergoing &s;o pain|ful an Operation, at a Time when he had an Hec|tic Fever; and was, upon the whole, very ill.</P>
<P>Having a Confidence in what I had heard of the Cures made by Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> with this Pa&s;te; I di&s;|patched the Gentleman's Servant to <HI>London,</HI> with a Letter to Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> and the Gentleman's Ca&s;e in Writing, drawn up by his Surgeon. Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> &s;ent down a Ball, weighing one Pound, of this Pa&s;te; directing him to take the Size of a Nutmeg two or three times a Day. He did &s;o; and, in le&s;s than three Weeks his Feveri&s;h Di&s;order left him; his Appetite returned; and, in about three Months he was perfectly cured of his Fi&s;tula, without any vi&s;ible Operation, or taking any other Medicine; to the great Surprize of his Surgeon. However, Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> ordered him to take another Ball, to confirm the Cure; which he did, at proper Inter|vals, and has had no Return of his Di&s;order, that I have heard of, though &s;ome Years have pa&s;t, and the Gentleman lives within a few Miles of my Hou&s;e in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Receipt for making this Pa&s;te &s;tands entered in Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book, in &s;ome re&s;pects dif|ferent from that I have given from Mr. <HI>D'O&s;ter|man:</HI> For, in the former, there is double the Quan|tity of Alicampane, to what there is in the latter. The Book likewi&s;e directs clarified Honey alone; whereas the above Receipt orders Honey and Sugar, equal Quantities, clarified together.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> entered his
<PB N="24" REF="25">Receipt &s;ome Time ago, and mi&s;took the Quan|tity of Alicampane: For I am a&s;&s;ured and con|vinced, that Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman</HI> always prepared this Pa&s;te for Him, in the Manner he &s;old it; that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> never &s;old any but of Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman</HI>'s pre|paring; and Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman</HI> affirms he never put a greater Quantity of Alicampane into this Pa&s;te, than is mentioned in this Receipt, &s;igned by him; and that the Addition of the Sugar was made, in order to pre&s;erve the Pa&s;te from turning Mouldy; as it is, otherwi&s;e, apt to do.</P>
<P>I think it proper, in this Place, to acquaint the Public, that Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman</HI> is another ingenious Chymi&s;t, who has been, for &s;everal Years pa&s;t, con&s;ulted and employed by the late Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> in wholly preparing &s;everal of the Medicines which he di&s;pen&s;ed; and particularly tho&s;e which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary for Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman</HI> to atte&s;t, as they differ, in &s;ome Particulars, from the Entries made in Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book.</P>

<P>Though the above Receipts &s;o nearly agree; yet as the Ingredients differ in &s;ome Re&s;pects, I have given both. The fir&s;t is taken from Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book. The &s;econd is vouched by Mr. <HI>D'O&s;ter|man,</HI> to be the &s;ame he prepared for Mr. <HI>Ward;</HI> and he a&s;&s;ures me that the Powder, thus prepared, was what Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> gave, with great Succe&s;s, in Drop&s;ical Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I am informed, by a Per&s;on &s;kilful in Pharmacy, that the latter is the Softer, and Smoother Medi|cine: For which Rea&s;on, and the A&s;&s;urance given me by Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> di&s;pen&s;ed it, chiefly, of late Years at lea&s;t; I make no Scru|ple of preferring it.</P>
<P>I am not able to &s;ay any Thing, <HI>of my own Ex|perience or Knowledge,</HI> upon the Subject of the&s;e Powders; for I never took any of them my&s;elf; nor ever knew any Body that did: But I have heard &s;o much of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Succe&s;s in this Di&s;|temper, and of the Efficacy of the&s;e Powders, that I have not the lea&s;t Doubt of their Merit.</P>

<P>TAKE two Pounds of true <HI>French</HI> Spirits of Wine: Put them into a large &s;trong Bottle; and add two Ounces of Roch Allum, in very fine Powder; Four Ounces of Camphor, cut very &s;mall; Half an Ounce of E&s;&s;ence of Lemon; and four Ounces of the &s;tronge&s;t Volatile Spirit of Sal Am|moniac.
<PB N="27" REF="28">Stop the Bottle quite clo&s;e, and &s;hake it three or four Times a Day, for five or &s;ix Days.</P>
<P>The Method of u&s;ing it, is to rub the Hand with a little of it, and hold it hard upon the Part affected, until it is dry. If the Pain is not quite relieved, repeat it twice or three times.</P>
<P>Atte&s;ted by me, <HI>F. J. D'OSTERMAN.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e Receipts is taken from Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book; and, I &s;uppo&s;e it to be a very good one: Yet, I give the Preference to the la&s;t, &s;igned by Mr. <HI>D'O&s;terman;</HI> who a&s;&s;ures me that the E&s;|&s;ence, long u&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> to remove Pains in the Head, Side, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by outward Application, was prepared and delivered by him, from time to time, to Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> at a certain Price.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> never &s;old any of this E&s;&s;ence; nor would He ever give any of it even to me: But He once cured me of the Head-Ach with it; and afterwards told me that He had entirely removed a Pain long &s;ettled in the upper Joint of His late Maje&s;ty's Thumb; when many other Remedies had been tried, without Effect: And <HI>that,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as he cured my Head-Ach.</P>
<P>From many other In&s;tances, which I have, occa|&s;ionally, been informed of, I do believe that this E&s;&s;ence, applied as above, will very often remove Local Pains.</P>
<P>What Deficiencies have occurred in Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Book, re&s;pecting the foregoing Receipts, I have got &s;upplied to general Satisfaction, I hope, as well as my own.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="29">
<P>That there are a great many more Receipts, of various Kinds, contained in the &s;aid Book, I ac|knowledge; yet, I have thought it be&s;t for the Publick, to confine my&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, to &s;uch as are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the Principal, the mo&s;t Effica|cious, mo&s;t known, and be&s;t under&s;tood.</P>

<P>The Difference, in Price, between what the above Medicines were &s;old for, and that at which they will now be &s;old, is undoubtedly great; and yet, there &s;till remains a con&s;iderable Difference between the Expenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of making them, and the Prices now put upon them: But when it is con&s;idered that a Profit mu&s;t be made, to pay tho&s;e who are to have the Trouble of &s;elling them; and a Per&s;on, who mu&s;t be employed to carry them from the Makers to the Venders, and keep an Account with each: What a va&s;t Number mu&s;t be &s;old, at <HI>&s;uch low Rates,</HI> to rai&s;e a Sum &s;ufficient to an&s;wer <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and, perhaps, other nece&s;&s;ary Contingent Charges: And that the <HI>Surplus,</HI> after di&s;charging the&s;e Ex|pences,
<PB N="29" REF="30">will, under certain Limitations, be equally divided between two Charitable Foundations: When all this is, I &s;ay, con&s;idered; no Di&s;&s;atisfaction can, I think, ari&s;e upon account of <HI>Price.</HI> Neither can I &s;uppo&s;e, that any Prudent or Well-di&s;po&s;ed Per|&s;on can, or will be inclined to <HI>buy</HI> the&s;e Medicines of any <HI>New Makers</HI> of them, though offered at a lower Price, when he con&s;iders that <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who have been <HI>long practiced</HI> in preparing Medicines of this kind, are mo&s;t likely to do it in the <HI>be&s;t Manner:</HI> And that the <HI>Net Profits,</HI> accruing from the Sale of tho&s;e made by the two ingenious Chymi&s;ts before-mentioned, will go towards the Support of two Laudable Undertakings; the One, intended to pre|&s;erve young de&s;titute Girls from Pro&s;titution and Wretchedne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> A&s;ylum.</NOTE>: The Other, to retrieve them from Both<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The</HI> Magdalen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have now explained which of the late Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Medicines I propo&s;e to lay open to the Pub|lick, at this time; and, why I &s;top here. The very low Price, at which it is intended they &s;hall be &s;old, has been mentioned: But let not this Circum&s;tance, which &s;hews how little they co&s;t in making, and renders them attainable to the <HI>Lower Cla&s;s of Man|kind,</HI> cau&s;e them to be de&s;pi&s;ed by the <HI>Highe&s;t;</HI> who ought always to remember, that they are of the &s;ame Species with the Lowe&s;t; and that <HI>Price</HI> does not alter the Nature of Things; though I have &s;een it influence Ta&s;te; which, like other of our Sen&s;es, is too often governed by Imagination.</P>
<P>Nor let this Circum&s;tance of <HI>Cheapne&s;s</HI> detract, in the lea&s;t from the Character of my late Friend; nor add too much to mine: For it &s;hould be made known&punc; and not forgot, that He obtained &s;ome of his Medicines by Experiments; &s;ome from his A&s;|&s;i&s;tants in the Chymical Way, whom he paid; and
<PB N="30" REF="31">others, perhaps, he bought at High Prices: That, when he returned from <HI>Paris,</HI> His &s;ole Dependence was upon the Sale of his Medicines; and that He was at con&s;iderable Expences, to keep him&s;elf up|on a Re&s;pectable Footing. Wherefore, if for the&s;e Purpo&s;es, and the better to enable him to gratify his Inclination in giving to the <HI>Poor,</HI> he made the <HI>Rich</HI> pay, who will blame Him?</P>
<P>But, to me He <HI>gave</HI> the&s;e valuable Secrets: And I (who am not, Thanks be to God, in the Situa|tion in which Mr. Ward was, at the time I have been &s;peaking of,) give them to the Public.</P>

<P>TAKE two Drops, in a &s;mall Gla&s;s of Water, in the Morning fa&s;ting, or at Night, going to re&s;t, for two or three Days together. Then for|bear as many Days as you took them; and pro|ceed as before, till the Bottle is fini&s;hed.</P>

<P>The Day you take it, avoid <HI>Milk, Greens,</HI> and <HI>Fruit.</HI></P>
<P>It has been experienced, with great Succe&s;s, in Ca&s;es where the Stomach or Bowels are foul; or the Pa&s;&s;ages ob&s;tructed: And, particularly, in in|veterate <HI>Rheumatic</HI> Di&s;orders.</P>

<P>WHEN the Sickne&s;s comes on, drink about half a Pint of warm Water, or thin Water-Gruel; and continue to do &s;o every time it works.</P>
<P>It has been found to clean&s;e the Stomach more effectually than the Vomits u&s;ually given; and that, without occa&s;ioning uncommon Reachings.</P>
<P>The Bottle is a full Do&s;e for a Man or Woman; which mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened, according to the Age and Strength of the Patient.</P>

<P>At fir&s;t taking, it may be proper to begin with half a Do&s;e; increa&s;ing it gradually, as Occa&s;ion may require.</P>
<P>If half the Quantity does not rai&s;e a proper Sweat; then take, the next Night, three Quarters, or the whole Do&s;e; and repeat it, every other Night, at Di&s;cretion; and for as long a Time as &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary; or as they agree with the Con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>In <HI>&s;tubborn Rheumatic Ca&s;es,</HI> and other &s;ettled Pains in the Limbs, the <HI>Red Pill</HI> has been found to an&s;wer better than the&s;e Powders.</P>
