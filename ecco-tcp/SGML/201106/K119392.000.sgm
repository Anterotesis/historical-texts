<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAIDSTONE is &s;ituated upon the banks of the river Medway, nearly in the center of the county of Kent. The country around it is remarkably fine, highly cultivated, and exceedingly rich and fertile; and, from its continual diver&s;ity of &s;urface, affords as great a variety of plea&s;ing views and beautiful land&s;capes as can well be con|ceived. The &s;oil is dry, firm, and rocky, abounds with excellent water, nor are there any putrid mar&s;hes or &s;tagnant pools within or without to corrupt its atmo&s;phere. The air is therefore pure and &s;alubrious; and a lofty ridge of hills &s;erves as a &s;creen again&s;t the unwhol&s;ome vapours and per|nicious bla&s;ts of the north and north ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The population, and of cour&s;e the trade and pro&s;perity, of the town &s;eem to have been greatly advanced, during the pre&s;ent century. The inhabitants were numbered in the year 1695, by the Reverend Mr. Innys, with a minutene&s;s and particularity which de&s;cended to the prefe&s;&s;ion, &s;ex, and age of each individual; and there were at that time, in the town and pari&s;h, 3676 per&s;ons; in March 1781 a very careful, and, there is rea&s;on to believe, not inaccurate &s;urvey again was taken, when the number was 5739, con|&s;equently an increa&s;e of 2063 inhabitants in the cour&s;e of about 86 years; from a &s;trict and fair examination of the
<PB N="4" REF="3">pari&s;h regi&s;ter, it appears, at lea&s;t with a &s;trong degree of probability, that the greater part of this addition of more than half the original number has been made during the la&s;t go years; the very period when ingenious and &s;pecu|lative men have believed and a&s;&s;erted that the depopula|tion of Great Britain has been uncommonly rapid, and that we have as it were been &s;inking fa&s;t into ab&s;olute annihilation.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to our intended ob&s;ervations, it may not be ami&s;s to illu&s;trate the advantages to be derived from accurate regi&s;ters of mortality in the words of Dr. Percival. "The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a judicious and accurate regi&s;ter of births and burials, in every town and pari&s;h, would be attend|ed with the mo&s;t important advantages, medical, political, and moral. By &s;uch an in&s;titution, the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of certain di&s;ea&s;es; the comparative healthine&s;s of different &s;ituations, climates and &s;ea&s;ons; the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity; with many other cu|rious circum&s;tances, not more intere&s;ting to phy&s;icians, than beneficial to mankind, would be a&s;certained with tolerable preci&s;ion. In a political view, exact regi&s;ters of human mortality are of &s;till greater con&s;equence, as the number of people, and progre&s;s of population in the kingdom, may in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and unexceptionable manner be deduced from them. They are the foundation likewi&s;e of all calculations concerning the values of a&s;&s;urances on lives, rever&s;ionary payments, and of every &s;cheme for providing annuities for widows and per&s;ons in old age; in a moral light al&s;o &s;uch <HI>Tables</HI> are of evident utility, as the increa&s;e of vice or virtue may be determined, by ob&s;erving the proportion which the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from luxury, intemperance, and other &s;imilar cau&s;es bear to the re&s;t; and in what particular places di&s;|tempers
<PB N="5" REF="4">of this cla&s;s are found to be mo&s;t fatal." Percival's e&s;&s;ays, vol. 2d.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h regi&s;ters of this kingdom, indeed, have not generally been kept with that degree of minute and accurate di&s;crimination nece&s;&s;ary for all the u&s;eful and curious deduc|tions here &s;ugge&s;ted, nor can it be pretended that that of Maid&s;tone in particular has. It appears, however, that the in&s;ertion of bapti&s;ms, marriages, and burials in it, after the common and ordinary way, has been always &s;o extremely regular as to afford, in conjunction with actual &s;urveys at different periods, much plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory information. Nay it may be truly added, that during the la&s;t 20 or 30 years, it has &s;ome peculiar recommendation, which will be apparent from the tables &s;ubjoined. Should the matter en|gage the attention of the medical gentlemen of the town (who are certainly be&s;t able to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct in an under|taking of this kind) it will probably for the future have every requi&s;ite di&s;tinction, and be annually publi&s;hed as regular bills of mortality. The cities of Norwich and Carli&s;le, the towns of Northampton, Eccles, and &s;ome others have &s;et the example. Maid&s;tone need not be a&s;hamed to follow; as it will appear, that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;he is little inferior to <HI>any,</HI> and greatly &s;uperior to <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of them. In the mean time, and till the regi&s;ter acquires this de&s;irable perfection, we will make the be&s;t u&s;e we can of it, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>

<P>The &s;lighte&s;t in&s;pection of this table &s;ugge&s;ts many curious conclu&s;ions. The fir&s;t 30 years, that is, during the reigns of James the 2d, of William the 3d, and of queen Ann, we ob&s;erve that both the bapti&s;ms and burials, and of cour&s;e the number of people were con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed; notwith&s;tanding that the thread manufacture, which is now dwindled to almo&s;t nothing, was then in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P>From this aera quite through the reign of George the 1&s;t, and to the latter end of George the 2d, the bapti&s;ms were continually increa&s;ing. The burials however advanced in a much greater proportion, and at intervals with &s;ingular <HI>ine|quality,</HI> in&s;omuch that in the 10 years, beginning with 1732 they were the more numerous by above 200, or almo&s;t one 6th of the whole. We cannot therefore certainly conclude that the inhabitants were much augmented, but only that the mortality of the town, from whatever cau&s;e, was greatly in|crea&s;ed. From that time to the pre&s;ent, the bapti&s;ms have been almo&s;t continually gaining on the burials, till in the 10 years, now immediately pa&s;t, they have got nearly 200 be|fore them, which probably indicates the double advantage of multiplied numbers and dimini&s;hed unhealthine&s;s. Upon ca&s;ting an eye over the <HI>annual</HI> li&s;ts of burials we &s;ee, that, be|fore the modern improved practice of inoculation was in|troduced every 5 or 6 years the average number was almo&s;t con&s;tantly doubled; and it is found upon enquiry, that at &s;uch intervals nearly the &s;mall pox u&s;ed to repeat its dreadful periodical vi&s;its. The numbers which died of this di&s;temper were not particularly noticed in the regi&s;ter till the year 1753; when they amounted to 70 per&s;ons out of the 209 that died in that year, and 102 out of 223 in 1760, and 54 out of 181 in 1766.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>Prior to the&s;e in&s;tances it broke out in the year 1734, and twice more in the cour&s;e of about 11 years immediately &s;ub|&s;equent to that; at each of which times it raged with greater violence and made much more terrible havock than in either of the periods above-mentioned; we may therefore very fairly conclude that in the &s;hort &s;pace of 30 years it deprived the town of between 5 and 600 of its inhabitants; whereas in the 15 or 16 years that have elap&s;ed &s;ince the general in|oculation it has occa&s;ioned the death of only about 60. Ample and &s;atisfactory evidence of the va&s;t benefit the town has received from this &s;alutary invention! And it appears, with a high degree of probability, upon proofs &s;imilar to the above, that, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, in the kingdom at large not le&s;s than 4 or 500,000 lives were lo&s;t in the former of the periods now &s;tated, and that nearly half that number has been &s;aved in the latter.</P>
<P>In the year 1695 the inhabitants were only, as before ob&s;erved, 3676; the annual burials on an average of 10 years immediately preceding were 147; and the annual mortality 1 in 25 of the whole population. In 1781 the people were 5739; the annual burials, upon an average of the &s;ame num|ber of years, taken in the &s;ame relation, only 152, and the proportionate mortality about 1 in 37&frac25;; of cour&s;e a diminu|tion thereof has happened of more than a 4th &s;ince the for|mer aera. This may perhaps in &s;ome &s;mall degree be a&s;cribed to the greater care and cleanline&s;s ob&s;erved in our pri&s;ons; the bettered condition of many of our inhabitants as well as hou&s;es; the improvements in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery, and the generally more &s;kilful treatment of various di&s;orders; but principally and chiefly to that di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ing of provi|dence <HI>inoculation.</HI></P>

<P>From this table we may conjecture the progre&s;s of popula|tion during the la&s;t 20 years, in the prodigious increa&s;e both of marriages and bapti&s;ms. The annual average of bapti&s;ms for the 5 years beginning with 1762 was only, 143; but for the 5 years now immediately pa&s;t it has been 188&frac15;; the marriages in the former period were annualy 44&frac45;; in the latter 55&frac35;. Making the one or the other the &s;tandard of computation, or both united, the town &s;eems to have ac|quired almo&s;t &frac15; of its pre&s;ent inhabitants &s;ince the year 1761; and after every fair deduction it can &s;carcely be le&s;s than 6 or 800 per&s;ons. And it may here be ob&s;erved that the marriage regi&s;ter, while &s;upported by corre&s;pondent bapti&s;ms,
<PB N="11" REF="10">is at once a pre&s;umptive evidence of the pa&s;t and the pre&s;ent, and a faithful promi&s;e with regard to the future.</P>
<P>The marriage regi&s;ter con&s;idered in another point of view bears very honourable te&s;timony in favour of the inhabitants. One of the be&s;t and mo&s;t accurate of the French writers on the &s;ubject of population e&s;timates the average proportion of marriages to the whole number of people in France at about 1 to 120; and in the city of Paris at 1 to almo&s;t 160. When it is con&s;idered what multitudes their eccle&s;ia&s;tical in&s;titutions ab&s;urdly condemn to celibacy, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that the proportion with us is much higher. By the following table we &s;ee that in Maid&s;tone, it is as 1 to 103; which is not only higher than the French average, with all the prodigious advantage derived from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he country pari&s;hes, but &s;uperior to mo&s;t other towns of &s;imilar de&s;cription, though inferior &s;ize, even in England.</P>

Now this was the very period in which the <HI>marriage act</HI> took place, and this decrea&s;e of weddings may at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;ugge&s;t a conclu&s;ion greatly to its di&s;advantage; and induce one to &s;uppo&s;e that it has operated as a powerful re&s;traint upon matrimony; but nothing can be more fallacious than &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. The marriage act has doubtle&s;s promoted regularity and order, has &s;ometimes re&s;trained folly and prevented mi&s;ery; but &s;carcely a &s;hadow of evidence has yet been produced, that it has at all ob&s;tructed judicious con|nections,
<PB N="13" REF="12">encouraged illicit intercour&s;e, or dimini&s;hed legal population. The diminution of marriages in the in&s;tance before us, evidently aro&s;e from hence. A &s;urrogate con|&s;tantly re&s;ided in the town. Before the marriage act he had often no doubt influence &s;ufficient to engage the parties to whom he granted a licence, to grant <HI>him</HI> in return the privilege of marrying them. But this was afterwards effec|tually prevented by their being obliged to have the &s;olem|nity performed in the pari&s;h to which one of them belonged; hence the &s;urrogate mi&s;&s;ed the additional advantage of the marriage &s;ee, and the weddings in the town were immedi|ately dimini&s;hed but unque&s;tionably they are to be found in the regi&s;ters of the neighbouring pari&s;hes. For taking a va&s;t number and variety of pari&s;hes of every &s;ize, &s;ituation, and de&s;cription, it appears that the aggregate proportion of marriages and burials has been con&s;iderably greater &s;ince the marriage act took place than before; which if it be not ab&s;olute demon&s;tration, is at lea&s;t &s;trong pre&s;umptive evi|dence, that in&s;tead of di&s;couraging matrimony, it has greatly promoted it, and been a powerful check to licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>We here &s;ee that the ratio of marriages to bapti&s;ms and burials jointly, in the former period, was about as 1 to 6 &frac14;; in the latter nearly as 1 to 5 &frac45;; of marriages to bapti&s;ms alone, in the former period, as 1 to 3 20/105; in the latter, as 1 to 3 10/100; of marriages to burials alone, in the former pe|riod, as 1 to 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7/100; in the latter, as 1 to 2 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">/100. The faire&s;t conclu&s;ion from this, is, that the wi&s;e and judicious regula|tions of the above-mentioned act have greatly increa&s;ed the number and proportion of marriages by rendering it more difficult for any per&s;ons to enjoy the <HI>reputation</HI> of matrimony without being really and actually married.</P>
<P>A very &s;triking circum&s;tance offers it&s;elf in the regi&s;ter of burials. By the &s;urvey of 1781 it appears that the number of maies was 417 fewer than the females, and yet on an ave|rage of the la&s;t 10 years, the male burials were annually about 8 more than the female; and it will be found upon making the requi&s;ite computations that only 1 in more than 40 have annually died of the females, and almo&s;t 1 in 32 of the males; and the &s;ame proportion has probably held through|out the 100 years, as the total of male deaths are to the female nearly as 14 to 13. What can this prodigious difference be owing to? Some allowance is doubtle&s;s to be made for the great number of female &s;ervants who come principally from the country, at perhaps the mo&s;t healthy period of human life, and who by the late &s;urvey alone amounted to 375 of the 417 by which the females exceed the males. But this circum&s;tance will not account for the 5th part of the di&s;|proportion before us.</P>
<P>Both French and Engli&s;h philo&s;ophers &s;eem to concur in opinion that women are naturally longer lived than men. But it may perhaps be doubted whether this be founded upon evidence &s;ufficiently various and exten&s;ive. From
<PB N="16" REF="15">mere analogical rea&s;oning ju&s;t the contrary might be con|cluded. Men are a greater number of years in coming to their full perfection, both in body and mind; and it is a gene|ral law of nature, that by how much longer any animal or vegetable is in growing, by &s;o much the longer it is in de|caying. Men are al&s;o of a con&s;titution more firm and robu&s;t; nor are they liable to an equal number and variety of di&s;ea&s;es: On every account therefore they appear fitted for a more extended duration; and agreeable to this obvious inference, it is a wellknown and generally acknowledged fact, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> men <HI>have</HI> lived to a greater age than even <HI>any</HI> women have done.</P>
<P>The very ingenious Dr. Hey&s;ham of Carli&s;le has remark'd "that the con&s;titutions of males are fitted for laborious ex|ertions, and that their mu&s;cular and nervous fibres may therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to become &s;tiff, rigid, and incapable of performing the functions nece&s;&s;ary to health and life &s;ooner than tho&s;e of females, both on account of their original tex|ture and the friction which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occur from la|borious exerci&s;e." But this rea&s;oning, however plau&s;ible, cannot perhaps be admitted; becau&s;e in country pari&s;hes, where the laborious exertions of the men are beyond com|pari&s;on the greate&s;t, the difference re&s;pecting the mortality we are &s;peaking of is va&s;tly the lea&s;t; and &s;ome times like|wi&s;e much in &s;avour of the male inhabitants; as is eminently the ca&s;e in the pari&s;h of Brightling, in Su&s;&s;ex; and many other in&s;tances &s;imilar to it might ea&s;ily be produced.</P>
<P>Men, it is true, are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to greater dangers and more numerous hard&s;hips than women; yet excepting &s;oldiers, failors, fi&s;hermen, colliers, and miners, and proba|bly a few manufacturers, this circum&s;tance has a very con|fined and trivial operation.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>There is one cau&s;e &s;till behind univer&s;ally allowed to operate, and which alone perhaps is funy adequate to the effect. Men are in general e&s;pecially in large and popu|lous towns, more intemperate than women, both in eating and drinking, and are likewi&s;e more commonly chargeable with every other irregularly and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of conduct. To the&s;e therefore may their greater mortality be mo&s;t fre|quently imputed; and thus this &s;ingular circum&s;tance of re|gi&s;ter evidence becomes a &s;erious topic of moral admoni|tion.</P>

<P>With regard to the great increa&s;e of population above demon&s;trated, we need not indulge the gloomy idea that it has ari&s;en from the depopulation of the country around.

The increa&s;e of the one has perhaps been at once the cau&s;e and the con&s;equence of the increa&s;e of the other. Allowing for extraordinary ca&s;es, where ever you have a large and flouri&s;hing town, you will &s;oon have a well cultivated and populous country, and where you have a well cultivated and populous country, you will &s;oon have a large and flouri&s;hing town; and it is amaz|ing how the oppo&s;ite apprehen&s;ion could ever have become

Their mutual riches encou|rage their mutual indu&s;try; their mutual indu&s;try &s;upply their mutual wants; the wealth of the town flows into the country, and the products of the country return into the town; their communication is eagerly rendered more and more ea&s;y by every po&s;&s;ible means; new roads are made, or old ones im|proved; fens and mar&s;hes are drained wa&s;te grounds and commons are inclo&s;ed, manured and cultivated; bridges are built, rivers are navigated canals are cut more hands are employed, and every quarter becomes at once more populous, more healthy and animated. This in &s;ome mea|&s;ure and with the exception of a few particulars has been the ca&s;e with Maid&s;tone and its vicinity for the la&s;t 20 or 30 years; but it has been &s;o in the fulle&s;t and ample&s;t degree with re&s;pect to more than half the kingdom; and it may be &s;afely affirmed upon &s;atisfactory evidence, that notwith&s;tand|ing the temporary and local checks we have received from the burdens of the pre&s;ent war.

<P>It mu&s;t here be ob&s;erved, that in the &s;urvey of 1781, were comprehended the women and children belonging to 4 or 500 &s;oldiers then quartered in the town, together with all other tran&s;ient and temporary lodgers. Of the former of the&s;e deno|minations we have now not any, and the latter are entirely un|noticed. It may al&s;o be remarked, that the time of the year at which this latter enumeration has been performed, is rather unfavourable for our numbers appearing to advantage; as &s;ome of our people are doubtle&s;s ab&s;ent in different parts of the cir|cumjacent country, upon harve&s;t-work and other labours of the &s;ea&s;on; a few we have unque&s;tionably furni&s;hed to the public &s;ervice of the kingdom, both in the army and navy; and the
<PB N="22" REF="21">peculiar unhealthine&s;s of the la&s;t winter and &s;pring, as well as the general hard&s;hip and pre&s;&s;ure of the times mu&s;t each have &s;omewhat checked our growth. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;advantages, our inhabitants now amount to 5755, which is 16 more than they were in March 1781; and after due attention to the &s;everal con&s;iderations now &s;ugge&s;ted, our actual perma|nent population can &s;carcely have been le&s;s augmented during the la&s;t 18 months, than 100 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>To the evidence already adduced, in proof of the extraordi|nary healthine&s;s of the town, may be added, from the pre&s;ent &s;urvey, the high proportion of children under 15 and of men and women above 70 years of age, as no unequivocal te&s;timony of the &s;ame plea&s;ing fact. In the city of Che&s;ter, the &s;alubrity of which has with ju&s;tice been con&s;idered as very highly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, the number of per&s;ons in the year 1774 above 70, was about 1 in 23&frac12; of the total population; in Carli&s;le in the year 1779, in 29&frac13;; whereas in Maid&s;tone it is &s;o high as nearly 1 in 20&frac56;. Again, the ratio of children under 15 in the city of Che&s;ter at the above-mentioned period, to the total number of inhabi|tants, was about 1 to 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; in Maid&s;tone it is more than 1 to 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; a &s;uperiority, it may fairly be pre&s;umed, which the diminution of the number between 15 and 70, from the peculiar circum|&s;tances of the times, can by no means deprive us of.</P>
<P>The number of reputed di&s;&s;enters from the church of Eng|land, of every denomination in the town and pari&s;h, if not exactly are very nearly as follows: tho&s;e u&s;ually &s;tiled Pre&s;|byterians 209&mdash;Bapti&s;ts 41&mdash;Independents 42&mdash;Methodi&s;ts 138&mdash;Quakers 2&mdash;In all 437.</P>
<P>N. B. Out of the 1115 Hou&s;es contained in the town and pari&s;h, there are only 12 empty, and &s;everal of tho&s;e merely for the purpo&s;e of being repaired.</P>
