<P>I Shall not amu&s;e the READER with Accounts how this Di&s;temper had its Fir&s;t Ri&s;e, or how it was brought into <HI>Europe,</HI> and to <HI>England</HI> in particular, or the &s;everal Ways by which it is Con|tracted, but &s;hall proceed to give you a True De&s;cription of every Stage of this Di&s;order, and the &s;everal Methods of Cure, in a mo&s;t certain, &s;afe and expedi|tious Manner, and &s;o plain, that every one may under&s;tand their own Ca&s;e, and cure them&s;elves without making it known to any.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The Symptoms, which formerly at|tended, were the falling out of the Eyes, Teeth and Nails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which hath not lately happen'd to any Body.</P>
<P>Several others are not now &s;o com|mon or &s;evere as formerly, &s;uch as the falling off of the Hair, Cru&s;ts all over the Body, Caries of the Bones, foul Ulcers of the Palate, Uvula, Jaws and No&s;trils, Nocturnal Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There are now only Four Symptoms left, and the&s;e are a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> a <HI>Bubo, Chancres,</HI> and <HI>Peri</HI> or <HI>Warts,</HI> which &s;eem to comprehend the whole Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Generally it con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> only, nor indeed do the other Symptoms &s;hew them&s;elves, unle&s;s the Cure is neglected, or managed by Unskilful Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> admits of an ea&s;ier Cure than formerly, and is often carried off without Medicines inwardly, if timely taken in Hand, and a due care taken in the Regimen.</P>
<P>As for the other Three Symptoms tho' they require a more Elaborate Treatment, yet they are now much le&s;s ob&s;tinate than formerly, all which &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed of in their proper Places and Order.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>GONORRHAEA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe fir&s;t Degree of Infection appears in Men, with a Gentle Running or dropping from the Urinary Pa&s;&s;age, pro|ducing a plea&s;ant Sen&s;ation, and as it were glewing up the Orifice, the Extremity of the Urethra, grows hot, and gapes wider than u&s;ual. The Parts of Generation are affected with an uncommon Titula|tion, e&s;pecially at the Time of making Water, without Pain, but with a Sen&s;e of Heat that daily increa&s;es.</P>
<P>If the Infection &s;preads, or is not &s;o mild, the Tention and Induration of the <HI>Penis</HI> come on with Pain, thick Drops of the more fluid part of the Semen, or Seed, flow in greater Quan|tity, of a yellowi&s;h or greeni&s;h Colour, often with Heat, Redne&s;s, Tenderne&s;s, &s;mall pu&s;tles, Bli&s;ters and Ulcers both within and without the Urinary Pa&s;|&s;age, with great Sharpne&s;s and Sen&s;e of Heat, through the whole Urethra after making Water.</P>
<P>The next Symptoms are more violent, the <HI>Perineum</HI> &s;wells, grows painful, the Urine &s;calds, with frequent Provocations
<PB N="6" REF="5">to make Water, and but a little at a Time, with a Di&s;tortion and Bending of the <HI>Penis,</HI> called a <HI>Cordee,</HI> with frequent and involuntary Erections, occa&s;ioning great Pain to the Patient, on every &s;uch Occa&s;ion, and when warm in Bed, a violent Running <HI>Phimo&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Paraphi|mo&s;is,</HI> that is when the Fore-skin is ei|ther &s;o &s;well'd as it cannot be brought forward to cover the Nut of the Yard, or that it cannot be drawn backward, one or both of the Te&s;ticles, or Stones &s;welled and enraged with Pain, increa|&s;ing as the Gleet or Running is ob|&s;tructed. Sometime cau&s;ing cold Trem|bling and Fainting, but as they abate &s;o the Running multiplies, and comes away more freely, of an A&s;h-colour, &s;ome|times marked with Specks, Streaks, or Threads of Blood; &s;tinking, yellow, green, and corrupt, and the&s;e are the u&s;ual or common Claps.</P>
<P>WOMEN. The Ca&s;e is almo&s;t the &s;ame in Women, but this is to be ob&s;erved, That after the Infection is received, the Female Parts of Generation are wet with an unu&s;ual Moi&s;ture, and are troubled with frequent Itching and Heat, almo&s;t painful and daily advances.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>The Heat, Burning, Redne&s;s and Pain of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> or Urinary-pa&s;&s;age, being in|crea&s;ed, the Admi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Penis</HI> is &s;carcely to be indur'd: The Urine is &s;harp and &s;calding, but in general not &s;o &s;harp as in Men, the Running plentiful, like Matter, bloody, yellow, green, and &s;tink|ing, and by the Tention of the <HI>Pudendum</HI> and <HI>Vagina,</HI> bring on great Pain.</P>
<P>If the Running is of a clear white, or a&s;h-colour, and any Thing ropy, &s;hews the Infection &s;light.</P>
<P>If of a Saffron Colour, dark yellow, or brown, from being mixt and di&s;coloured with Blood, is the <HI>&s;econd Degree</HI> of a <HI>Clap.</HI></P>
<P>If a yellowi&s;h green, green, or very dark green, mixt with Matter plainly &s;hews that the Inflamation is attended with Ulcers, and is the <HI>la&s;t Stage</HI> of a <HI>Clap.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e different Symptoms appear, but vary according to the Temperament of Body, Habit and Con&s;titution of the Patient, and the greater or le&s;&s;er Degree of the Infection, and the Di&s;tance of Time &s;ince the Injury was receiv'd.</P>
<P>You are to ob&s;erve, That the greater the Degree of the <HI>Venereal Poi&s;on</HI> is, the &s;ooner it appears, but a &s;light Hurt will remain for &s;ometime before it &s;hews it&s;elf; but the &s;ooner it appears the ea&s;ier
<PB N="8" REF="7">is the Cure perform'd. From what hath been &s;aid it plainly appears, That there are Three Di&s;tinct SPECIES of the <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> which only differ in Degree, the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> will ea&s;ily degenerate into the <HI>Second,</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> into the <HI>Third,</HI> if the Vehemence of the Symptoms be not quickly re&s;train'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Three Degrees are divided into Four <HI>Stages,</HI> that is, the Beginning, Increa&s;e, Height, and Declintion.</P>
<P>Neither Man or Woman can indulge in the U&s;e of <HI>Venery,</HI> whil&s;t they are in this State of a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> without violent Pain; and what is wor&s;e, without mani|fe&s;tly increa&s;ing the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing to be con&s;ider'd is, to learn and under&s;tand your own Ca&s;e, by ob&s;erving the Nature of it; there|fore it is expedient to remark, what Effect the <HI>Venereal Poi&s;on</HI> hath on the Body, according to the &s;everal Symp|toms herein before di&s;cribed, whereby you will plainly di&s;cover the Degree of Infection, and by that Means be directed in the Method of Cure.</P>
<P>I proceed now to give proper Directi|ons to each Per&s;on to cure this Di&s;ea&s;e in its &s;everal Stages, and &s;hall trace them all in a Regular Manner; but ob&s;erve
<PB N="9" REF="8">that every <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> if Medicines are timely admini&s;tred, is free from Danger, and ea&s;ily admits of a Cure, &s;ooner or later, in Proportion to the Vehemence of the Symptoms, the Acrimony of the Infection, and the Con&s;titution of the Blood; but if neglected, and come to a great Hight, is &s;ometime before it will yield to any Medicine, therefore too early an Application cannot be made for Cure.</P>
<P>An Information therefore follows of &s;uch Antivenereal Remedies as are in|dued with all the Natural Qualities re|qui&s;ite to perform a &s;peedy and &s;afe Cure, in all the Ca&s;es herein de&s;cribed, and that the Patient may be directed, and readily know how to be furni&s;hed with all &s;uch Medicines, and be &s;ecure from all Bad Preparations, (&s;old at &s;e|veral Shops in <HI>London</HI>) by Authors who conceal their Names, which they would have no Occa&s;ion to do, did their Pre|parations an&s;wer what they pretend for them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t Degree of this Di&s;tem|per being Exterior, and only in the Top of the Urinary-pa&s;&s;age, may be cured by External Means, for as that part is
<PB N="10" REF="9">of a Spongy Nature, it as ea&s;ily imbibes any Liquid, as the Venereal Poi&s;on, for which the INCOMPARABE LOTION, or WASH is recommended as the mo&s;t ea&s;y and private Method of Cure what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>And this is performed by only pour|ing &s;ome of the Liquid into a Cup, wa&s;hing the part with it, and &s;oaking it therein two or three Times a Day, for two or three Minutes together or longer, as you have an Opportunity; but be &s;ure to let the Water cover the Nut of the Yard, and to take fre&s;h Liquor for every Wa&s;hing. Surely no Per&s;on that is not in Love with Pills, Bolus, and Electuaries, will refu&s;e &s;o ea&s;y a Cure as this, and &s;o &s;oon performed.</P>
<P>This Remedy mu&s;t be of &s;ingular Be|nefit to all Travellers, who cannot po&s;|&s;ibly take Phy&s;ick on their Journey, therefore this LOTION is advi&s;ed to them, let the Degree of Infection be what it will, for if not to be cured by this Remedy alone, yet it will mo&s;t cer|tainly prevent their growing wor&s;e, un|til they have an Opportunity of taking other Medicines, which mu&s;t be of great Advantage to them.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>Tho&s;e who are taking phy&s;ick, if they u&s;e this INCOMPARABLE LOTION will &s;oon find it to forward the Cure to Ad|miration, by drawing out the Infecti|ous Venom, while the Internal Medi|cines by their anodine and detergent Qualities a&s;&s;wage the pain, and cleans the Ulcers of the Seminary Receptacles.</P>
<P>This LOTION is to be had only of the Author RIHARD ROCK, at his Hou&s;e in <HI>King's-Arms-Court, Ludgate-Hill,</HI> and ready to be deliver'd to any Me&s;&s;enger, by asking for a <HI>Bottle</HI> of <HI>Wa|ter</HI> for the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> Price 4 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> where you may have Advice and proper Re|medies (prepared by the Author) in all other Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>As &s;ometimes the Cure will not be performed perfectly by the LOTION only, by Rea&s;on of the Di&s;po&s;ition of the parts of Generation; for &s;ome Ve|nom may lay hid in the Wrinkles of the <HI>Frenum</HI> or <HI>Prepnce,</HI> and the lea&s;t Seeds of Morbifick Matter being introduced into a Sound Body, in the &s;malle&s;t Quantity, will by Degrees increa&s;e, in Bulk, Form and Efficacy, and &s;ooner or later, infect and corrupt the whole Ma&s;s of Humours.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>Therefore for Fear of &s;uch an Acci|dent, and to make the Cure certain and &s;afe, the INFALLIBLE ANTIVE|NEREAL BOLUS is recommended, which is plea&s;ant to take, and will mo&s;t certainly eradicate any Lurking Poi&s;on, which the Water may not happen to reach, two or three of which will be &s;uf|ficient to perform the Cure, without any Danger of Return. To be had as be|fore directed, by asking for the BOLUS for the RHEUMATISM, <HI>Price</HI> 1 s. each. Tho&s;e who &s;u&s;pect they have received an Injury, or have any Relicts of a for|mer Di&s;order, may by taking a Do&s;e or two, be perfectly freed from &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>This Medicine hath no unplea&s;ant Ta&s;te, never cau&s;es any Sickne&s;s, Gripe|ings, or other Di&s;orders of the Body, e&s;pecially after the Fir&s;t Do&s;e or two. But as the very Name of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> is nau|&s;eous to &s;ome Per&s;ons, they may wet a piece of Wafer in a Spoon by dipping it into Water, then put in the Bolus and cover it with the Wafer, and then there can be no Ta&s;te, but of the Water only in taking it. The&s;e Wafers are to be
<PB N="13" REF="12">had at every Confectioner's, you may have a great many for 2 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Be &s;ure to ab&s;tain from all Acts of Venery whil&s;t under Cure, for one &s;ingle Act will increa&s;e the Di&s;order more than three Do&s;es of Phy&s;ick can rectify.</P>
<P>The le&s;s Wine or Strong Liquor that you drink the better; but Spirituous Liquors mu&s;t not be touched, yet you may in the Evening drink a Gla&s;s or two of Wine to &s;upport the Spirits, if you find Occa&s;ion, always remembring the le&s;s you drink of Strong Liquors the better: Neither &s;hould you eat any High-&s;ea&s;on'd Meats, Pepper, or other Spice, and the more &s;pareing you are in Diet, much the &s;ooner will the Cure be perfected, for the more Impure Bodies are nouri&s;hed, the wor&s;e they grow al|ways. But to drink plentifully of Small-Beer, or Milk and Water a little warm, when the Phy&s;ick is not working, is good, and Water-Gruel or Green Tea at all Times. Of any of the&s;e Liquors you cannot drink too much.</P>
<P>You may go Abroad while you take Phy&s;ick, but be careful to guard again&s;t Wet, Windy, or very Cold Weather; at
<PB N="14" REF="13">&s;uch Times it is be&s;t to confine your&s;elf, if your Affairs permit.</P>
<P N="2">2d. For the Second Degree of Infec|tion, the Per&s;on that hath this Di&s;order mu&s;t take a <HI>Bolus</HI> every other Day, very early in the Morning until he finds the Heat of Urine gone, and the Running decrea&s;ed, or but little in Quantity, neat, clear and white, and become &s;omewhat Ropy, which will appear by touching &s;ome of it with your Finger and Thumb, and pulling them a&s;&s;under gently; and if it draws out in Strings, or ropy, in &s;uch Ca&s;e you may be a&s;&s;ured the Cure is near perfected, and nothing then remains but to &s;trengthen the Weakned parts; &s;o then he mu&s;t leave off taking any more <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and take of the <HI>Bal&s;amick Re&s;trictive</HI> ELIXIR, 50 Drops betimes every Morning, at Four in the After|noon, and at Night going to Re&s;t, al|ways fa&s;ting an Hour before and after taking it, and this you mu&s;t continue un|til the Running is wholly cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It neither purges or gives any Man|ner of Di&s;order, but keeps the Body in a due Temperament, &s;trengthning all Weakne&s;s of the Back, Genitals, and Reins, Seminal and Urinary Ve&s;&s;els, and
<PB N="15" REF="14">thereby mo&s;t certainly prevents a Gleet, which frequently happens after a Vene|real Injury, for want of taking &s;uch Re|&s;trictive and Strengthning Medicines.</P>
<P>If the Heat of Urine &s;hould be vio|lent, during the Time you are taking Phy&s;ick, or that you are troubled with a Stranguary or Difficulty in making Wa|ter, be&s;ides the <HI>Bolus,</HI> he mu&s;t take of the following <HI>Diuretick Powder,</HI> drink|ing plentifully as often as you can, too much you cannot, of thin Water-Gruel, Green Tea, or Milk and Water a little warmed, &s;weetned to your Ta&s;te with Sugar, and this mu&s;t be continued until &s;uch Unea&s;ine&s;s and Pain is gone.</P>
<P>This will occa&s;ion you to make Water in a con&s;iderable Quantity at each Time, and clear or of a pale Colour; if of a high Colour, it is for want of drinking &s;o much of tho&s;e Liquors as you ought</P>

<P N="3">3d. Now if from the great Acrimony, or Quantity of the received Infection; from the Neglect of applying proper Re|medies,
<PB N="16" REF="15">in Time, to check the Di&s;order; from great Irregularity in Drinking, or Diet; from the previous Acrimony of the Blood; or from the Weakne&s;s of the Parts the Symptoms increa&s;e, then ari&s;es the Hight or la&s;t Stage of a Clap,</P>
<P>For the Cure of which, the Patient mu&s;t ob&s;erve all the Rules and Direc|tions before given in the Slighter Ca&s;es of this Di&s;order, and ought to take the Quantity of a &s;mall Nut on the point of a Knife, every other Morning, of the Mo&s;t Noble ANTIVENEREAL ELEC|TUARY, or &s;o much as he finds will give him five or &s;ix Stools, until the Heat of Urine is gone, and the Run|ning appears clear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as before, and then the BALSAMICK ELIXIR is to be taken as in other Ca&s;es; by taking of which (and ob&s;erving all former Di|rections) in a very &s;hort Time the Heat of Urine, all Sorene&s;s and Pain, will be perfectly removed, and all other unea&s;y Symptoms.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Per&s;ons Six Do&s;es of this mo&s;t Excellent ELECTUARY, will carry off all the Malignant Di&s;order, in others 10, 12, or more are required, according to the Teperament of Body, or the
<PB N="17" REF="16">Stubborne&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and as the <HI>Party</HI> &s;hall be more or le&s;s ab&s;tinnous.</P>
<P>I would not have any think the Cure long, for nothing can be more perniti|ous to the <HI>Patient,</HI> than too &s;hort a Cure, (if it may be termed &s;o) for by &s;topping the Running &s;o &s;uddenly, the Blood and Juices are infected, the <HI>Patient</HI> poxed, and probably he and his Po&s;terity ruin'd; whereas when all the Degrees of this Di&s;ea&s;e are wholly taken off, not too &s;ud|denly, but by a due Method and proper Remedies, which is the onle &s;afe and &s;ure Way, there can be no Danger of any ill Con&s;equences following, which this <HI>Ele|ctuary,</HI> I aver, will perform.</P>
<P>One Thing more I have to offer, that is, whoever takes of this <HI>Electuary,</HI> will never be troubled with a <HI>Gleet,</HI> which mo&s;t of the other common purging Me|dicines will do. The <HI>Price</HI> of this <HI>Ele|ctuary</HI> is 6 <HI>s.</HI> a <HI>Pot.</HI> Enquire for a <HI>Pot</HI> of <HI>Electuary</HI> for the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>

<P>There remains a Fourth Species of the <HI>Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> to be added to tho&s;e which we have already de&s;cribed.

<P><HI>Cau&s;ticks</HI> may be us'd to con&s;ume the&s;e Excre&s;&s;encies, but the Pain is hardly to be endur'd, and frequently brings on In|flammations; therefore to take them off with a Knife or Sci&s;&s;ors is the mo&s;t cer|tain and ea&s;ie&s;t Way, for then the Affair is fini&s;h'd in a Moment; otherwi&s;e the Pain mu&s;t be very acute for &s;ome Length of Time: But if the Patient dreads the Knife or Sci&s;&s;ors, he mu&s;t be indulg'd with the U&s;e of <HI>Cathaeretics.</HI> After the Inci&s;ion the Sore is to be treated in the &s;ame Manner as a Green Wound.</P>
