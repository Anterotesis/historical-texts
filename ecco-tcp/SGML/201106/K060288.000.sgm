<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the</HI> GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS is a Di&s;temper of that inveterate and malig|nant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the be&s;t Phy&s;icians of all Ages: No Method of Phy&s;ic, Diet or Habit, however regular, rea&s;ona|ble and orderly, no Pre&s;criptions, tho' bearing the &s;pecious and plau&s;ible Sanction of Academic Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Di&s;temper, or reach its &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es; for, re|tiring into the Extremities of the fine Capillary Ve&s;&s;els, where, by rea&s;on of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in tho&s;e Parts, its venemous Particles are &s;uffer'd to attract one another with great Violence: It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oft|ner yield to one lucky No&s;trum, than all the repeated A&s;&s;aults of what they call Regular Practice, which is never more ineffectual and at a Lo&s;s, than in this Ca&s;e; and more e&s;pecially, if that No|&s;trum be prepared as The&s;e DROPS are, for &s;uch a Species of Simples as are capable of being render'd, by &s;uch Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmo&s;t nervous Colls, increa&s;e the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood, till having di&s;turb'd their At|traction, and broke them, by repeated Colli&s;ions, one again&s;t an|other, into the minute&s;t Parts, it forces mo&s;t of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Per&s;piration, obtunding, ab&s;orbing, and carrying the re&s;t away with it in its Cour&s;e, till arriving at the Kidneys, they are &s;ecreted there from the Blood, and pa&s;s away by Urine. All which Operations, The&s;e DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Ab&s;orbent, and Detergent Qualities; opening at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forcing off, through them, the very Root and Ba&s;is of the Di&s;temper they are to cure; and that this is the only effectual, rational Method of treating this ob&s;tinate Di&s;temper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Na|ture, Dr. Sydenham, who &s;ays, What&s;oever is a&s;&s;i&s;tant in di&s;charg|ing the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of an&s;wering the Intention of Cure for which it is de&s;ign'd, whether in the Gout, Rheumati&s;m, or any other Cronic Di&s;temper. And his Authority, I &s;hould think, ought not rea&s;onably to be di&s;puted in the Cure of this Di&s;temper, whom, not only a va&s;t Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a prodigious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but al&s;o a continued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, con|firm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Di&s;temper; which is al&s;o confirm'd by what tho&s;e two admiral Phy&s;icians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us con|cerning the Cau&s;e of it; which, &s;ay they, is created by the mucila|ginous
<PB N="5" REF="5">Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and &s;tiff, by Means of a &s;harp acid Humour flowing thereon, which, coagulating the oily Liquor &s;ecreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their &s;everal Articulations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, in&s;tead of promoting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting that Motion, impeed, and prevent it, by clogging the Inter&s;tices &s;o that they cannot move at all, at lea&s;t, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwi&s;e taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the mi&s;erable Patient, as daily Experience manife&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now you are to ob&s;erve, That the Particles which compo&s;e this &s;harp acid Humour, are &s;urrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Ve&s;&s;els thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood it&s;elf, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but the&s;e being either obtunded and blunted, and the Points of them, as it were, &s;heath'd and wrap'd up in &s;ome of the Particles of this Medicine, or el&s;e drove violently again&s;t one another with a Force &s;ufficiently to break off tho&s;e little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Per&s;piration by others; or el&s;e &s;o di&s;turb'd and &s;epa|rated by this new Auxillary Force, that they cannot attract one an|other, but un willingly di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in the Blood, and are many of them &s;ecretted and carried off by Urine; This, I &s;ay, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily an&s;wer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are render'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Cour&s;e, the Di&s;temper before caus'd by them, mu&s;t by Degrees abate, and at length ab&s;olutely cea&s;e. To which Ends and Purpo&s;es, The&s;e DROPs are &s;o excellently adapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature &s;o very Ab&s;orbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Opera|tion of tho&s;e three Qualities, which are &s;carce to be met with, in any con&s;iderable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, &s;ome who under&s;tand no more of this Di&s;temper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will &s;ay, That, probably in the former Stage of this Di&s;temper, the&s;e Drops may be effectual; but, &s;ay they, mine is in my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objec|tion this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Pha&s;e of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakne&s;s and debility of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Cour&s;es of u&s;ele&s;s Phy&s;ic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes &s;o weak and languid, and its Motion &s;o &s;low and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e Parts, which can only be remedied by &s;uch Things as warm and in|crea&s;e the Blood's inte&s;tine Motion, &s;o breaking and di&s;turbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and &s;ending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpo&s;e, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than The&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="6">Drops, which have &s;uch a fine invigorating Alexiterial Property in them, as to render them one of the be&s;t Cardiacs in the whole Materia Medica.</P>
<P>THE Do&s;e, in the former Pha&s;e of the Di&s;temper, is a large Spoon|ful, in any warm Vehicle, as Mountain Wine, &s;trong Ale, &amp;c. made as hot as you can drink it, repeated three Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, going to Bed, and, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, you need not fear Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the latter Pha&s;e, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd, and invigorated, it is nece&s;&s;ary that you increa&s;e your Do&s;e as the Cau&s;e may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; compo&s;ing your &s;elf after it, and encouraging the Sweat by all proper Methods.</P>
<P>After this, in order effectually to rout this mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">errible Enemy; it is nece&s;&s;ary you continue to take a &s;mall Do&s;e of about 100, or 150 Drops, every. Three Nights alternately; taking three Nights, and mi&s;&s;ing three Nights; till &s;uch time as you find the Strength of the Di&s;temper to abate, which it will &s;en&s;ibly do in a &s;mall time, and at length quite go off.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of the Cure of this Di&s;temper, by The&s;e DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Per&s;ons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would &s;atisfy the Curious of their wonder|ful Effect in that Intention; but not being willing to tire the Reader; and the&s;e Drops by their continual Succe&s;s, &s;o &s;trongly recomending them&s;elves; I &s;hall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few, as you will find at the end of this Treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the</HI> Rheumati&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in the foregoing Chapter, been &s;o very particular in de&s;cribing the Origin, Nature, Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s and Cure of the Gout; there will be the le&s;s need of enlarging in this upon a Di&s;&s;emper, &s;o near a kin to it as the Rheumati&s;m; even &s;o near, as, in many Con&s;titutions, to be owing to the &s;ame Cau&s;e, with this only Difference in the Effect, that as the former preys chiefly upon the Joints, and extream parts of the Body; This, for the mo&s;t part affects the Membrana communis Mu&s;culorum, or rather, to &s;peak more properly, the Membrana adepo&s;a; at lea&s;t that part of it which lyes between the Mu&s;cles, and the Cutis, and is the Ba&s;is or the Cel|lulae adepo&s;ae; being full of &s;mall, fine Glands for the &s;ecretion of that Oily. Sulphureous Matter, of which the Adeps or Fat is compo&s;ed, which Sulphureous Oil being coagulated, by the &s;ame means, &s;ays a learned Author, and from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, as the Juices of the Mu|cilaginous glands in the Joints, are in the Gout; that is to &s;ay, from the Attraction of &s;harp, acid Particles, &s;ecreted from a vi&s;cous Blood; this Membrane, in which tho&s;e Glandulae adepo&s;ae are &s;cituated, be|comes &s;uff, har&s;h and rigid, and unapt for Motion, the Oil which tho&s;e Glands continually di&s;charge for lubricating the Mu&s;cles, be|ing all turn'd by Coagulation into a fizey thick Jelly: So that every time the Mu&s;cle or Mu&s;cles, round which that part of this Membrane is wrap'd, contract, in order to perform Mu&s;cular Motion; they
<PB N="7" REF="7">are, in&s;tead of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted therein by that lubricating Oil, impeeded and confin'd by the &s;tiffne&s;s of the Coagulum, and the Rigidity and Har&s;hne&s;s of the &s;urounding Membrance, 'till, by force of the ner|vous fluid flowing into the Fibres, and extending them in the Con|traction, they force it to give way; which is not without great Pain, and con&s;equent Weakne&s;s and Sorene&s;s of that Part: Not to men|tion the Pains cau&s;ed by the unnatural Di&s;tentions of the Ve&s;&s;els, from the Quantity of Vi&s;cid Serum ob&s;tructing them and hindring the free Circulation of the Blood; e&s;pecially in the fine Capillary Channells, without a con&s;iderable Dilatation; from whence, not &s;eldom proceed A&s;tma's, Pleuri&s;yes, Peripneumonys, Inflamations, Fevers and Death.</P>
<P>This is only to be remedy'd by Diluents and Evacuating Medicines, as in the Gout; but not by any common Evacuators; many or mo&s;t of which weaken Nature too much in their Operations, and being us'd without proper Diluents, will evap'rate all the real natural Se|rum, and leave nothing but a &s;ort of Serous Jelly in the Blood; which thereupon will either immediately Stagnate, or Efferve&s;ce in &s;uch a manner, as to cau&s;e a violent putrid Fever, and, without al|mo&s;t a Miracle, the certain Death of the Patient: It is true, they may ea&s;e the violent Pains of this Di&s;temper, but if at the &s;ame time they increa&s;e the Inflamation, and Efferve&s;cence of the Blood, the Fever proportionably increa&s;es, and the poor deluded Patient dies; as too many do by common Practice: Whereas the&s;e DROPS dilute and expel what is redundant; whereby the Blood is re&s;tored to its na|tural Cra&s;is, it's due Velocity, and Impetus recover'd, the Pains cea&s;e, the Fever abates, perfect Health en&s;ues. Be&s;ides which by their Alex|iterial, Cardiac Qualities, at the &s;ame time that they thus encrea&s;e the Impetus and Moment of the Fluids to the Di&s;charge of the Mor|bific Matter in Pre&s;piration; they al&s;o warm and comfort the whole nervous Si&s;tem, a&s;&s;i&s;t mightily in repairing the Wa&s;te of the animal Spirits, occa&s;ion'd thereby; which is evident in what has been alrea|dy &s;aid of them concerning the Gout in the Stomach, and Bowels, proceeding from a real Weakne&s;s and Decay of Nature.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, no Preparation was ever yet found out &s;o &s;uitable to the very Nature of this Di&s;temper as the&s;e DROPS; which will plain|ly appear from the va&s;t number of Certificates of Cures wrought by them every Week, out of which I have thought fit to trouble you with but a few.</P>
<P>THE Do&s;e and manner of ordering your &s;elf, is the &s;ame as be|fore directed in the Gout; to be varied according to the Di&s;tem|por, and &s;trength of the Patient's Con&s;titution, from 80, to 150 or 200 Drops, in any convenient Vehicle; which need not be &s;o &s;trong and &s;piritous as in that Di&s;temper; but mu&s;t be drank as warm as po&s;&s;i|ble going to Bed, and Covering your &s;elf up warm, as before.</P>

<P>This Di&s;temper ari&s;es from ob&s;tructions in the Glands of the Liver thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them, in that Vi&s;cus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith gives a Yellow Tiucture to the Mucus or Corpus Reticulare &s;pread under the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Colour: This is the fir&s;t and common Pha&s;e of this Di&s;temper; but it will &s;ometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and more e&s;pecially in hard Drinkers, arrive to that height, as to Cau&s;e a frequent Spitting and Vomiting of Blood, which is general|ly reckon'd a Mortal Symptom; for it is cau&s;ed by the Ob&s;tructions it the Hepatie Glands becoming &s;chirrous, and &s;o indurated, as with great Difficulty (if at all) to be opened again; which &s;traitens the Motion of the Blood through that Vi&s;cus &s;o much, as to cau&s;e it to revul&s;e with a great Motion into the Ga&s;trick Arteries, which go of from the Hepatic, in&s;omuch, that breaking through them, it drains into the Stomach, and by that means the Cour&s;e of that fluid is alter'd the Secretion of the Bile at an End, and the whole Sy&s;tem de&s;troy'd.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of</HI> ASTHMAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE prodigious Variety of Cau&s;es from whence this Di&s;tem|per proceeds, in different Con&s;titutions, gives it &s;o many va|rious Species and Degrees, as to render it one of the mo&s;t difficult Di&s;orders to be skilfully manag'd of any affecting the human Sy&s;tem. But the chief &s;orts are, the Humid, the Dry, and the Nervous A&s;thma; of each of which I will &s;eparately give a few Hints concerning their Cau&s;es and Sy&s;tems, and then proceeding to the De&s;cription of the Effects of the&s;e Drops in all tho&s;e Intentions.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e what an A&s;thma is in general; That it is a frequent, difficult, and &s;hort Re&s;piration, or Breath|ing, join'd with a hi&s;&s;ing Sound, and a Cough; e&s;pecially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Po&s;ture, or lying down: The former becau&s;e the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;phere is greater in the Night than in the Day, when the noxious Vapours are exhal'd and di&s;pel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by rea|&s;on of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circumambient Cold, our Tran&s;piration is le&s;&s;en'd, and con&s;equently a Gravedo or Weight of per&s;pirable Matter en&s;ues; which being flung upon the Lungs, clogs them, and renders them le&s;s apt to perform their Office; and in the la&s;t Ca&s;e, from the Pre&s;&s;ure which the Contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Po&s;ture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby le&s;&s;ening the Capacity of the Thorax or Brea&s;t, &s;o that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate them|&s;elves &s;ufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, it will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, how the&s;e &s;e|veral Kinds of A&s;thmas are produc'd: The fir&s;t or Humid, call'd al|&s;o the Pleuretic A&s;thma, ari&s;es from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and vi&s;cous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to pa&s;s through the &s;mall Fibres of the Lungs &s;tick clo&s;e to the Sides of tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, and ob&s;truct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts &s;well and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feveri&s;h Habbits, and dif|ficulty of breathing: Or el&s;e the pituitous Particles are &s;pewed out into the Bronchiae, e&s;pecially if not impregnated with a due Pro|portion
<PB N="10" REF="10">of Salts, cau&s;ing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Ca&s;es all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretics, and whatever attenuates and le&s;&s;ens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Ve&s;&s;els, and working a Revul&s;ion of the &s;tagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect than the&s;e DROPS, which evacuate both by Per&s;piration and Urine, and are certainly, at the &s;ame time, one of the very be&s;t Cardiacs in the whole World.</P>
<P>The next Species of this Di&s;temper, is the dry or plethoric A&s;thma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochy mious Blood call'd a Plethora, or el&s;e by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in its Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far di&s;tend|ed; and con&s;equently there is not room enough for the Air to in|flate the Ve&s;&s;els, which produces an Inability of Re&s;piration, for want of a due Degree of Expan&s;ion in that Vi&s;cus: Such Per&s;ons are generally crying out for Air; they always &s;eem as if girted hard upon their Che&s;t, and are almo&s;t become Victims to a long Scorbutick Cachetic Habit; of which this is the la&s;t, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remrdies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; for in this Ca&s;e there is no time to u&s;e Alteratives, which work but &s;lowly in the Ma&s;s of Blood; whereas, here we want an immedi|ate A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Car|diacs and Diapheretics, both which Qualities are eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hable in the&s;e DROPS; which can therefore never fail the Inten|tion of Cure in this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The Third and la&s;t Sort of A&s;thma I ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on'd, was the Ner|vous; which is occa&s;ion'd by a Deficiency of the Pectoral Mu&s;cles, for want of a &s;ufficient Quantity of Spirits to nouri&s;h and contract them; and is the dire Effect of a nervous Atrophy; and to be re|medy'd by high, and vigorous Cardiacs; to rou&s;e and invigorate decaying Nature, and, as it were, re-enkindle the almo&s;t extingui&s;h'd Lamp of Life; which nothing can perform more effectually than the&s;e DROPS, which have a prodigious Influence in reviving the drooping Spirits, warming and comforting the Nerves, encrea&s;ing the Moment of the Blood, and doing every other Office requi&s;ite to call back the almo&s;t fleeting Life, by their admirable Cardiac Qua|lity; in&s;omuch that many have been re&s;tor'd to a Miracle, from even Death's Door by them alone, both in this and other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Do&s;e in all the&s;e three Ca&s;es, is as before in the Gout, in any convenient Vehicle, but good Mountain Wine is be&s;t, if it can be procur'd, made very warm, as before; and taking Care you do not get Cold after it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of Colds, Agues, Fevers,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Put the&s;e Di&s;tempers all in one Cla&s;s, becau&s;e they have a mu|tual Relation the one to the other, as the Cau&s;e has to the Ef|fect, &amp; Econtia, and as different Effects produced from the &s;ame Cau&s;e have to one another; for it may generally be allow'd,
<PB N="11" REF="11">that what we call Colds are the Ba&s;is, or Groundwork of mo&s;t of tho&s;e Epedemic Fevers, which &s;o commonly rage in this Kingdom: for per&s;piration being dimini&s;h'd thro' a Contraction of the pores, caus'd by the perception of external Cold, the per&s;pirable Matter flies off in a le&s;s Quantity than when the pores are more relax'd; and that part thereof which cannot get out, returns back into the Blood, which it heats and irritates more or le&s;s, according to the Quantity of Matter retain'd, forcing it to di&s;tend it's Ve&s;&s;els, and producing thence frequently a Solutio continui, whence follows the Idea of pain in that part, with a Gravedo or He wine&s;s of the whole Frame, but e&s;pecially of the di&s;eas'd part; or el&s;e, a Coryza or Defluxion of &s;erous, &s;harp Humours from the Glands of the Head, thro' the Eyes, No&s;e, Mouth, &amp;c. from whence, if &s;peedy Care is not taken, are engender'd A&s;thma's, Con&s;umptions, Fevers, &amp;c. and a whole Train of Evils which may be ea&s;ily and certainly pre|vented, by a timely U&s;e of &s;ome proper Evacuator, which &s;hall by its Diaphoretic Quality, di&s;charge the Blood of its Load of fo|reign deleterious Matter; and force off the offending Particles thro' the Pores; which we call Sweating: To which Purpo&s;e, there is no one Thing in Nature more effectual than the&s;e Drops, which are a mo&s;t powerful Diaphoretic, and never fail of Succe&s;s in the mo&s;t &s;tubborn Cold whatever.

<P>And &s;o 'tis here, a &s;ingle Do&s;e &s;eldom or never fails curing a Cold, whereas if you let that Cold grow into a Fever, it may be the Work of &s;everal to compleat the Cure; and glad you may be to come off &s;o; for nothing corrupts the Blood more than a Cold, by irritating, and inflaming it to the highe&s;t Degree; whence proceed Putrefacti|ons, which if not evacuated by proper Remedies, increa&s;e the Fer|vour, and often generate acute, putrid, and malignant Fevers, who&s;e dire Effects daily Examples &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate to every one's Experience. The&s;e deleterious and malignant Particles are therefore to be evacuated, both by augmenting the before dimi|ni&s;h'd Per&s;piration, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ary Secretion; for by that means, a great Quantity of them pa&s;s off with the di&s;charg'd Sarum, and on Cour&s;e leffen the Fermentation in the Blood: But unle&s;s at the &s;ame Time, you u&s;e proper Cardiacs to refre&s;h Nature, &s;he will &s;ink under this va&s;t Burthen, for the Hurry and Heat the Blood is in, ne|ce&s;&s;arily con&s;umes a va&s;t Quantity of the animal Spirits, which de|caying fa&s;ter than N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ure can po&s;&s;ibly return them, &s;he mu&s;t certain|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all beneath the prodigious Wa&s;t; unle&s;s reliev'd by &s;ome auxilia|ry Force.

<PB N="12" REF="12">
<P>As for Agues they are only the Intermi&s;&s;ions of Fevers, the cold Fit being only an accidental, and not an e&s;&s;ential Property there|unto; &s;o that as they are properly a Species of a Fever, they are to be treated after the &s;ame Manner, and the Method and Intention of Cure, is the very &s;ame; and if &s;o then con&s;equently the &s;ame Remedy that prevails again&s;t one, cannot fail in the other.</P>
<P>And here, I cannot omit mentioning one peculiar Property in the&s;e Drops, &s;ufficient of its &s;elf to recommend them effectually to all the rea&s;onable Part of Mankind; who are not wedded to me|thodical Error; and that is, their mo&s;t powerful Energy in clearing the Blood from the Dregs of that fa&s;hionable (but in many Ca&s;es pernicious) Drug the Bark of Peru; commonly call'd, The Je&s;uites Bark. This is the publick A&s;ylum of Mankind, the Panacea of the World, the &s;overeign and univer&s;al Orvietem again&s;t all the Di&s;ea&s;es of Pandora's Box, and what not, in the Opinion of tho&s;e valetu|dinarian Wretches, who dare not eat a Meal's Meat, open a Cham|ber Window, or &s;o much as go to Stool, without the Leave of their Phy&s;ician; who&s;e con&s;tant Pre&s;cription is &s;till the Bark, in &s;ome Form or other: If Madam has got a Fit of the Vapours, the Bark will chear her Spirits; If &s;he has taken too plentiful a Do&s;e of Ratifea, the Bark will make her as &s;ober as a Nun; If &s;he is Love&s;ick, the Bark is to moderate her De&s;ires; and if &s;he's in the raging Fever of Jealou&s;y, the Bark is to make her believe that her Husband is as con&s;tant as a Turtle: In &s;hort, whenever the Privy-Counceller of Health is at a Lo&s;s what to do for his Guinea, he per&s;uades his Pa|tient &s;he has an Intermitting Fever, and Bark is the Word to &s;ave the Expence of further thinking. Now by this you may judge, whe|ther this gigantic Protean Drug, which is whim&s;ically apply'd to &s;o many chimaerical Evils, is of any valuable U&s;e, any &s;ub&s;tantial Be|nefit to Mankind in real Di&s;orders, and Maladies, ari&s;ing from a vitiated State of the Fluids. We &s;eldom play with &s;erious Matters, nor make Children Rattles of Diamonds. One learned Practitioner &s;ays, the Bark is a violent Styptic, and A&s;tringent; another, it is &s;olutive, and will of it's &s;elf, without proper Alteratives, pa&s;s im|mediately downwards; One &s;ays it con&s;i&s;ts of a fix't Salt. another of a volatile, and a third that it is a Compo&s;ite of both: One that it gives a Spur to the inte&s;tine Motion of the Blood; another that it locks up every Thing in the Blood, Some and tho&s;e of Note too a&s;&s;ert, that if given in large Quantities, it will by 'tis attenuating Pro|perty create an Ana&s;arca, or Drop&s;y; others that it is it&s;elf &s;uffici|ent if taken in Time to cure a Drop&s;y: One forbids the U&s;e of it in Rheumatick Fevers, for fear it's attenuating Virtue rarely the Ma&s;s of Blood, and thereby enlarge the Dimen&s;ions of it's Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o far, as to occa&s;ion an Aneuri&s;ma or Rupture, or at lea&s;t greatly encrea&s;e the Idea of pain, of which Opinion, are no le&s;s Men then the fa|mous Morton and Sydenham; whereas another later practitioner, no ways inferiour to either, by all means indicates the Bark in this Ca&s;e, grounding his Notion upon Rea&s;on, and to u&s;e his own Words, conte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing and changing the common and trite but de|ceitful Method of Practice by Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
<P>Now if this be the Ca&s;e, that the&s;e great and learned Men cannot agree among them&s;elves, neither as to the Nature, nor Effect of this magical Drug; is it not greatly to be fear'd, and that with very good Rea&s;on, that if one is mi&s;taken, they may all of them be &s;o; the Con|&s;equence whereof will be, that this famous panacea, like the Jay in the Fable, &s;trip't of all it's borrow'd pomp, will appear to be of no other U&s;e, but to fill up the Variety of Nature's Works; receiving a value only from Opinion, grounded on the Weakne&s;s of one part of the World, and the Wileyne&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>But if there be ana Virtue in this Drug, the Ta&s;t it&s;elf &s;eems to point it out to be Styptic, and A&s;tringent, which is al&s;o generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Fa&s;hion &s;ake they admit of other Qualities, as it were by pre&s;criptive Right; and for Intere&s;t invent new ones to authorize it's Admini&s;tration in &s;ome pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptick and A&s;tringent, it points out directly to the Manner of it's Ope|ration and Effect; in &s;eemingly giving a Turn to &s;ome certain pe|riodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally admini&s;&s;er'd, as intermitting Fevers, Hemicranea's, Haemoptoes, Epilep&s;ies, and Hy&s;teries; which &s;ays a great and learned Author, are to be re|liev'd by the Cortex only; but what Way is this Relief to be had? why, &s;ays the &s;ame Author, the Cortex locks up the febrile Ferment in the Blood; and, &s;ays he, in another Place, If Catharticks be gi|ven &s;oon after it they make the Type of the Fever return in it's old Shape, for when the Bark is carried off, what locks up the Di&s;tem|per? From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plau&s;ible Appearances, and in&s;tead of really working a Cure, only po&s;tpones the Exacerbation, it may be for a Week, or a Fortnight, by locking the Cau&s;e up in the Veins; which upon any accidental Cold, little Irregularity, or imprudent Management, breaks out again with double Violence; the Con&s;equence whereof is not &s;eldom attended with the Death of the Patient, as common Experience daily confirms; unle&s;s with Morton you continue do&s;ing your Patient with it every ten Days, till the next Syzygy; or el&s;e with another gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Phy&s;ician give him as much after the Di&s;temper is taken off as was &s;ufficient to take it off in or|der to prevent a Return, &s;uppo&s;ing that</P>
