<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE terrible Havock the <HI>Small Pox</HI> hath of late made among&s;t Mankind in &s;everal Parts of the World, together with the fearful Apprehen&s;ions &s;o many Thou&s;ands now lie under, dreading the Effect of this fatal and &s;ore Di&s;order, induces me to offer the following Pages to the Public. For I cannot appear ju&s;tifiable to my&s;elf, that a Secret which hath never failed to procure this Di&s;tem|per in the mo&s;t &s;afe, ea&s;y, and mild Manner, &s;hould be any longer kept from the Public. But, in the Pro&s;ecution of this (perhaps) a few Individuals, who&s;e principal Motive is Self-Intere&s;t, may be offended at my publi&s;hing a Subject to the World which they think &s;hould be confined to the Faculty only. <HI>Salus Populi,</HI> I think, will hold good in the Matter, and to an&s;wer this Purpo&s;e more effectually I &s;hall omit all &s;et Phra&s;es and technical Terms; as the Intention of this is not meant to di&s;play the Grammarian or Orator, Humanity being the leading Principle, for Advantages I want none. Humane it mu&s;t evidently be, to point out a certain, plain, and infallible Me|thod of relieving the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our Fellow-Creatures; few Di&s;orders having produc'd more public Calamity than that loath&s;ome Di&s;temper, and from Time to Time, the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians have on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions found them&s;elves at their <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore a Method which is here offer'd, not only regarding the Preparation of the Patient, but likewi&s;e the Treatment during the whole Cure; the Efficacy of which being hereby laid open to
<PB N="iv" REF="3">the Public, the &s;urprizing &s;alutary Service re&s;ulting will &s;peak more for the Author than any pompous Apology.</P>
<P>Di&s;coveries of any Kind, however rational or beneficial, are ge|nerally received with &s;ome Degree of Dubiety: It mu&s;t not there|fore &s;eem &s;trange if this of mine &s;hould be objected to by &s;ome, who, for want of other Arguments, will quarrel with it on a religious Account: But to tho&s;e good People I &s;hall &s;tate this Ca&s;e of Con|&s;cience by ob&s;erving. That the Almighty God in his great Mercy to Mankind hath taught us a Remedy to be u&s;ed to prevent the fatal Effects of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> upon the U&s;e of which, the Patient will be unattended with tho&s;e direful and dreadful Apprehen&s;ions, &s;o long the Companions of this Di&s;temper; and in con&s;equence of the Means here offered, neither Health nor Life in Danger. To the&s;e People I appeal, whether a Chri&s;tian may not employ this Remedy, and be very thankful to a Supreme Being for his Good Providence in cau&s;ing Mankind to be able to make a Di&s;covery, &s;o beneficial and valuable in its Nature; and the peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing attending the Succe&s;s thereof, evidently to be produc'd by the Thou&s;ands which have happily and &s;afely recovered without Pain, or even Confinement to their Beds.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly there may be tho&s;e, whom no Arguments can prevail upon. I &s;hall therefore &s;pend no more Time in the Attempt to convince them of the Lawfulne&s;s and Goodne&s;s in the Practice of Inoculation, but refer them to Experience, which will certainly open the Eyes of tho&s;e few Oppo&s;ers to this &s;afe and &s;alutary Method. The whole of which I have endeavoured to lay down in a plain and ea&s;y (tho' not elegant) Dre&s;s; for my Endeavour is to be under&s;tood by every Body, and the Reader may depend that no Medicine is here offered but what is founded upon, and is the Re&s;ult of, long Ob&s;er|vation and Experience.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with ob&s;erving, that tho&s;e who make u&s;e of the Means here offered them will be &s;ufficiently convinced of the Humanity and Integrity of the Author.</P>

<HEAD>INOCULATION MADE EASY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fatal Con&s;equences which in general attend that loath|&s;ome and very dangerous Di&s;temper, the SMALL POX, the dreadful Havock it has made, from Time to Time, among&s;t Mankind has induced &s;everal humane, learned, and able Men, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to find out a Method to render this alarm&icirc;ng Di&s;order more mild and favourable. INOCULATION was then thought on. The <HI>Greeks</HI> are &s;aid to be the fir&s;t Nation that practi&s;ed this Method; the <HI>Turks</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have borrowed it from them, and practi&s;ed it with the greate&s;t Succe&s;s, not only for the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but even for the <HI>Plague</HI> it&s;elf. The frequent Accounts we had of their great Succe&s;s in almo&s;t putting a total Stop to the Fata|lity of this &s;ore Di&s;temper, induced us to follow their Example; but, however this may be, it was practi&s;ed by us at fir&s;t with no very con&s;iderable Succe&s;s, yet it proved much more favourable in its Effects than the natural Kind. This occa&s;ioned &s;everal others to attempt a &s;till farther Improvement, and has from Time to Time, been brought to a &s;till greater Degree of Perfection, &s;o that out of an Hundred Patients, perhaps only Two or Three have lo&s;t their Lives; tho' a great Part of them have had the Di&s;temper in a very &s;ore and terrible Manner. But by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Providence we have now brought it to the very utmo&s;t and greate&s;t Degree of Perfection imaginable; &s;o that in fact it now cea&s;es to be any longer
<PB N="6" REF="5">a Di&s;temper; for what can be a greater Proof, what can a&s;certain the Excellency of this new Method more than the plain and con|vincing Demon&s;trations we have now before our Eyes, and the Thou&s;ands of living Witne&s;&s;es to prove it? for Nine Thou&s;and People or more, who have been inoculated, (within Thirty Miles round the Town of <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and within the Space of the&s;e two la&s;t Years) not a Single Patient has lo&s;t his Life; and what is &s;till more extraordinary, they have had this Di&s;temper in &s;o mild and favourable a Manner, that the greater Part of them have been capable of carrying on their Trades and Bu&s;ine&s;s during the whole Time, not being confined by it one Hour to their Bed or Room; except out of a Complement to tho&s;e who have not had it, and would be fearful of catching it from them, may have induced &s;ome to keep up a few Days, but not from the Effect of the Di&s;tem|per. This Method has al&s;o the&s;e &s;everal Advantages with it; <HI>viz.</HI> That it has been tried and an&s;wers with all Ages and Complexions, on every Con&s;titution; the robu&s;t and infirm, the black and the fair, the corpulent and the lean; and in each extreme Sea&s;on of the Year, the Summer and the Winter. Nor has it failed in any one In&s;tance; the Patient being &s;ubject to very &s;light Symptoms, &s;en&s;ible of very little Sickne&s;s; nor do what few Eruptions they have, ever leave any Scars or Pits behind them.</P>
<P>I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing farther in Behalf of this excellent Method of recovering the Di&s;temper. Therefore &s;hall immediately proceed to lay before my Readers the Manner and Me|dicines, which will an&s;wer all tho&s;e extraordinary Virtues above mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to the Manner of preparing the Body to receive the Infection.&mdash;But as the Preparation is material, and of &s;ome Im|portance, I hope no one, who intends to be inoculated, will be &s;o far an Enemy to them&s;elves, as not to be &s;trictly careful and atten|tive to the Rules here laid down; which are meant to lower the Blood and Humours, and render the Body &s;ufficiently prepared to receive the Infection in the mo&s;t favourable Manner.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t ab&s;tain from all Salt Provi&s;ions whatever, nor mu&s;t you eat any Kind of Meat or Butter; nor drink Beer or Spirituous Liquors, not even Wine; Chee&s;e and &s;piced Foods are likewi&s;e prejudicial.&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="6">But to make it more clear, I have &s;et down a Regimen, or Method of preparing, which mu&s;t be continued and per&s;evered in for Nine Days at lea&s;t, and is as follows:</P>

<HEAD>Directions for taking the <HI>Preparative Powders.</HI></HEAD>
<P>After having &s;trictly ob&s;erved the foregoing Rules for Nine Days, you mu&s;t take one of the Papers of Powders at Bed-Time, in the Pulp of a roa&s;ted Apple, or any Jelly, and next Morning a Paper of the Salts, di&s;&s;olved in a little boiling Water, drinking plentifully of Water-Gruel, Chee&s;e-Whey, or Small Tea, as they work. The Patient &s;hould be very careful of Cold, during the Operation of
<PB N="8" REF="7">the Phy&s;ic; and if it does not operate Six or Eight Times in about Six Hours, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take half another Paper of the Salts, (more or le&s;s as Occa&s;ion requires). Or if they be vomited up &s;hortly after being taken, as &s;oon as the Sickne&s;s is entirely off, one of the other Papers of Salts mu&s;t be given. The other Powders and Salts are to be taken as above, omitting Three Days between each Do&s;e. The Deficiency of Salts may be had at an Apothecary's: It will be requi&s;ite for the Patient to have a Stool on each of the intermediate Days during the Preparation, in order to which Stew'd Prunes, Roa&s;ted Apples, or Tamarinds, &s;hould be eaten occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now inform my Reader how to make every Medicine to be u&s;ed throughout the Di&s;order, and fir&s;t the PREPARATIVE POWDERS are as follows.</P>
<P>Take ten Grains of Calomel and one Grain of factitious Cinnabar, and mix them well together for one Do&s;e.</P>
<P>A Child of &s;ix Years old may take a fourth part of a Paper; from eight Years old to twelve half a Paper, and from twelve Years old to fifty a whole Paper; from &s;ixty Years old to an hundred half a Paper; be careful not to omit taken the Salts in the Morning as before ordered; the Salts are <HI>Glauber</HI>'s Salts. A grown Per&s;on may take from half an Ounce to an Ounce, Children half an Ounce only: The&s;e POWDERS greatly clean&s;e the Blood, are not only very effec|tual to prepare the Body for the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> but may al&s;o be depend|ed upon as a never failing Remedy for Worms, as it &s;cours away tho&s;e roped vi&s;cid Humours which are apt to breed them in the Bowels; they may be taken with the greate&s;t Safety by Men, Women and Children, ob&s;erving the above Rules: they are good likewi&s;e in Cutaneous Di&s;|orders, &s;uch as Foulne&s;s of the Skin, or Sores or Ulcers, and teterous Eruptions, the Itch and Lepro&s;y; and tho&s;e who are unwilling to be Inoculated, yet fearful of catching the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> in the natural Way, may in a great Mea&s;ure, be &s;ecured from it by taking the above POWDERS, for it Purifies the Blood in &s;uch a Manner as to render it le&s;s liable to the receive the Infection. Or if the Di&s;temper &s;hould be caught after taking the POWDERS, the Patient may depend upon having it in a more favourable Manner. The&s;e POWDERS are al&s;o very valu|able
<PB N="9" REF="8">as a Common Purge in the Spring of the Year, but Salts mu&s;t in all Ca&s;es be taken after them. Ob&s;erve, that when Children from two to five Years old are to be Inoculated, it will not be proper to give them the POWDER, but in&s;tead of which you mu&s;t give them a Dram of Manna di&s;&s;olved in warm Milk or Water, repeat it each Day, and continue it for a Week or ten Days, at the End of which time you may Inoculate them.</P>
<P>After the Patient has &s;ufficiently prepared him&s;elf by &s;trictly follow|ing the Directions for the Regimen; that is, having Dieted him&s;elf one Week, and the next Week dieting as before, and taken his POW|DERS, he is now fit for Inoculation, which is very ea&s;ily perform'd as follows: You mu&s;t get &s;ome Matter out of a Ripe Pock upon the Point of a Needle, &s;harp-top Pen-knife, or Launcet, and with any of the&s;e In&s;truments (having the fre&s;h Matter on its point) you mu&s;t make a &s;mall Inci&s;ion or Prick on the Arm, between the Elbow and the Shoulder; you need only make the &s;malle&s;t Drop of Blood appear, and wiping the mattery Part of the In&s;trument on the Place, 'tis done. In about four or five Days the Inoculated Part will grow a little red; in a few Days more it will ri&s;e to a Kind of Pu&s;tule ha|ving Matter in it; after which it decrea&s;es and goes away of it&s;elf. Several of my Patients have only had this Eruption, and no other Appearance of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> upon them; but it is as effectual as having a large Number of Pu&s;tules. In about &s;ix or &s;even Days af|ter the Inoculation, the Patient &s;ometimes feels a Kind of a &s;light Pain in the Inoculated Arm, in his Back and Head, but all tho&s;e Symptoms &s;oon go off. About five Days after the Inoculation, the Patient (if of a robu&s;t gro&s;s Habit of Body) mu&s;t at Night, going to Bed, take one of the <HI>Repellent Pills;</HI> if it operates but little, take an|other in the Morning; if that &s;hould have no con&s;iderable Effect, take two more Pills again at Night; on the contrary take only one, the remainder to be taken the next Morning. The Intention of the&s;e Pills are to carry off the Matter which would occa&s;ion Eruptions. The Pills are made as follows<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Patient mu&s;t ob&s;erve to continue &s;trictly to the Regiment till all the Symptoms of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> have left him: which from the Preparation to the Recovery is gene|rally about three Weeks.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> REPELLENT PILL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take</HI> ten Grains of Kermes Mineral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Virtues of Kermes Mineral, <HI>See</HI> Dr. <HI>James</HI>'s Di&s;pen&s;atory.</NOTE>, twenty Grains of the be&s;t Succotrine Aloes, and ten Grains of Camphor, add a &s;ufficient quantity of Spirits of Wine to make them into a Ma&s;s for Pills, which is done by beating them together in a Mortar; of this Com|po&s;ition make four Pills.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>You mu&s;t fir&s;t pound the Camphor with a few drops of Spirits of Wine, then mix the other Ingredients.</HI></P>
<P>Some few have a &s;light Fever at the time of breeding the Pock, tho&s;e are de&s;ired to drink plentifully of the following Decoction, or <HI>Punch,</HI> as it is termed in <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>The Patient may have it made, or make it him&s;elf, the Effects of which is to carry off the Fever. The Receipt is as follows.</P>
<P>Take unground Oats a Handful, and boil them for &s;ome time in a Quart of Spring-Water, then &s;train it, with which mix half an Ounce of Stibiated Nitre, half an Ounce of Citron, or Lemon-Juice, and an Ounce and half of the Sirup of Violets. About &s;ix or &s;even Days after Inoculation this Liquor &s;hould be drank very plentifully, as it tends from its cooling Quality to carry off every Symptom of the Fever.&mdash;[The Ingredients may be had at any Apothecary's; nor mu&s;t the Patient be without it.]</P>
<P>But to make this u&s;eful Liquor more cheap and ea&s;y to the Poor, I have &s;et down another Method of making of it, which in a great Mea&s;ure will an&s;wer all the Intentions of the fir&s;t, and is as follows.</P>
<P>Boil a Handful of Oats in a Quart of Spring-Water, add to it after it is &s;train'd, half an Ounce of Salt-Petre; &s;harpen this Liquor with a little Lemon Juice or Vinegar, and &s;weeten it to the Palate with brown Sugar or Honey.</P>
<P>This will not be &s;o plea&s;ant as the fir&s;t Method of making it, tho' almo&s;t as effectual; by drinking plentifully of this the Fever will be almo&s;t immediately lowered: The fir&s;t taking of it &s;hould be to drink half a Pint, or more at going to Bed at Night.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the whole Progre&s;s of the Cure, and if all the Rules here laid down are &s;trictly attended to, the Patient may de|pend upon having the Di&s;temper in the mo&s;t favourable manner.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>The great Succe&s;s which in general attends this Method of Ino|culation is no ways &s;urpri&s;ing; nor need we wonder at &s;o many dying with it that have it in the Natural Way; for when we come to con&s;ider, that while the contagious Matter is exerting its Malig|nity upon the Humours, (which is generally &s;even or eight Days) Quietne&s;s, Moderation in Diet, together with clean&s;ing Medicines, and every thing el&s;e is &s;trictly ob&s;erved in Inoculation; whereas ma|ny incur the Natural Di&s;temper on a &s;udden, when the Blood is heated with Wine and Exerci&s;e, by which means all the Symptoms mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prove more &s;evere and dangerous.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, that I do not pretend to per&s;uade the Public, that all the Inoculators in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> make u&s;e of the&s;e Medicines exactly as here &s;et down, or that all of them make u&s;e of the &s;ame Com|po&s;itions: I only &s;ay that the greate&s;t Succe&s;s may be depended upon from a proper u&s;e of the&s;e Medicines, they having all that Virtue comprehended in them, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render the Di&s;order mild and favourable, as I have happily experienced by the Number of Patients, who have recovered from this Di&s;temper without being confined to their Bed or &s;carce &s;en&s;ible of any Pain.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Treati&s;e with &s;ome few Cautions to tho&s;e who take the Medicines. Tho&s;e of a very weak and delicate Con&s;titution, may prepare with taking only half a Paper of the POWDERS at a time with the Salts, and go on till all the Papers are taken. In ca&s;e the POWDERS &s;hould cau&s;e the Mouth to water, or an Inclination to Spitting, (which I never knew happen in the Cour&s;e of my Practice) upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, the Patient mu&s;t take larger Do&s;es of Salts, and about an Hour after take near half an Ounce of Flour of Brim|&s;tone, which will prove an effectual Remedy. Be careful of the Subject which you Inoculate from, that it be a mild and favourable Sort, and that the Per&s;on is free from any other Di&s;temper. The Patient, as I have before ob&s;erved, mu&s;t the fir&s;t Week prepare by Diet, &amp;c. the next Week prepare to take the POWDERS, (living as by Direction above) then Inoculate, and upon breeding the Pock, drink plentifully of the <HI>Punch</HI> before mentioned, and the Patient will find this Method an&s;wer his mo&s;t &s;anguine Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>In about a Week after the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>is quite over, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for the Patient to lo&s;e a little Blood, and take a Do&s;e of Salts.</HI></P>
