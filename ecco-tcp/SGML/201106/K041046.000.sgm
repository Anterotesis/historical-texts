<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is, perhaps, no &s;ubject in phy&s;iology, and very few in philo&s;ophy in general, that has en|gaged more attention than that of the u&s;e of <HI>re&s;piration.</HI> It is evident, that without breathing mo&s;t animals would pre&s;ently die; and it is al&s;o well known, that the &s;ame air will not long an&s;wer the purpo&s;e: for if it has been fre|quently re&s;pired, the breathing of it is as fatal as the total deprivation of air. But by what property it is, that air contributes to the &s;upport of animal life; and why air that has been much breathed will no more an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, &s;eems not to have been di&s;covered by any of the many philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians who have pro|fe&s;&s;edly written upon the &s;ubject; and it might have con|tinued to elude all <HI>direct inve&s;tigation,</HI> when it di&s;covered it&s;elf, without any trouble or thought, in the cour&s;e of my re&s;earches into the properties of different kinds of air, which had at fir&s;t quite another object.</P>
<P>In the&s;e experiments it clearly appeared, that re&s;piration is a <HI>phlogi&s;tic proce&s;s,</HI> affecting air in the very &s;ame manner
<PB N="4" REF="3">as every other phlogi&s;tic proce&s;s (<HI>viz.</HI> putrefaction, the efferve&s;cence of iron-filings and brim&s;tone, or the calcina|tion of metals, &amp;c.) affects it; dimini&s;hing the quantity of it in a certain proportion, le&s;&s;ening its &s;pecific gravity, and rendering it unfit for re&s;piration or inflammation, but leaving it in a &s;tate capable of being re&s;tored to a tolerable degree of purity by agitation in water, &amp;c. Having di&s;|covered this, I concluded, as may be &s;een Phil. Tran&s;. vol. LXII. p. 187. and <HI>Ob&s;ervations upon Air,</HI> vol. I. p. 78. 277. that the u&s;e of the lungs is to carry off a putrid <HI>effluvium,</HI> or to di&s;charge that phlogi&s;ton, which had been taken into the &s;y&s;tem with the aliment, and was become, as it were, <HI>effete;</HI> the air that is re&s;pired &s;erving as a <HI>men&s;truum</HI> for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>What I then concluded to be the u&s;e of <HI>re&s;piration</HI> in ge|neral, I have now, I think, proved to be effected by means of the <HI>blood,</HI> in con&s;equence of its coming &s;o nearly into contact with the air in the lungs; the blood appearing to be a fluid wonderfully formed to imbibe, and part with, that principle which the chemi&s;ts call phlogi&s;ton, and changing its colour in con&s;equence of being charged with it, or being freed from it; and affecting air in the very &s;ame manner, both out of the body and in the lungs; and even notwith&s;tanding the interpo&s;ition of various &s;ub|&s;tances, which prevent its coming into immediate con|tact with the air.</P>
<P>As it may not be unplea&s;ing or unu&s;eful, I &s;hall, before I relate my own experiments, briefly recite the principal of the opinions which have been held con|cerning
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">the u&s;e of re&s;piration, from HALLER'S excellent <HI>Sy&s;tem of Phy&s;iology,</HI> and &s;ome others of the mo&s;t eminent writers upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HIPPOCRATES reckoned air among the <HI>aliments</HI> of the body. But it was more generally the opinion of the an|cients, that, there being a kind of <HI>vital fire</HI> kept up in the heart, the heat of the blood was tempered in the lungs. GALEN al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es, that there was &s;omething equiva|lent to a fire con&s;tantly kept up in the heart; and that the chief u&s;e of the lungs was to carry off &s;uch vapours as were equivalent to &s;moke thrown off from that fire. HALLER, vol. III. p. 354. CARTESIUS maintained the &s;ame vital fire in the heart, &s;uppo&s;ing that air was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for cooling and conden&s;ing the blood. <HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 343.</P>
<P>Of the more modern phy&s;iologi&s;ts, &s;ome have thought that the air it&s;elf is taken into the lungs; others, that it is only &s;omething extracted from the air, as the more &s;ubtle parts of that fluid, an ether, or aerial nitre; while others &s;uppo&s;e it to be the air it&s;elf, but di&s;&s;olved in water, and therefore in an unela&s;tic &s;tate, <HI>ibid.</HI> p. 321.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who think that air is taken into the blood &s;uppo&s;e it to be taken in by the lungs, <HI>ibid.</HI> p. 330. Some &s;uppo&s;e, that the effect of the admi&s;&s;ion of this air into the blood is a fermentation, p. 332. Others &s;uppo&s;e, that it acts by its &s;pring, preventing the too clo&s;e contact of the globules, and thereby pre|&s;erving its fluidity, inte&s;tine motion, and heat, <HI>ibid.</HI> BER|TIER &s;uppo&s;ed, that the circulation of the blood was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the admi&s;&s;ion of air into it. VAN HELMONT a&s;cribed the volatility of the fixed ele|ments
<PB N="6" REF="5">in the food to this air, p. 336.; and STEVENSON thought, that the air which had circulated in the blood, and which had heated the blood too much, was exhaled by the lungs, p. 355.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that the air it&s;elf is not admitted into the blood, but only &s;ome active, &s;pirituous, and ethereal par|ticles; that this vital &s;pirit pa&s;&s;es from the lungs to the heart and arteries, and at length becomes the animal &s;pi|rits, which are by this means generated from the air, p. 333. Others, who do not admit that the animal &s;pirits are derived from the air, &s;till &s;ay that &s;ome other <HI>vital principle</HI> comes from thence. This vital principle MAL|PIGHIUS &s;uppo&s;es to be a &s;aline vapour; LISTER, a hot, inflammable, &s;ulphureous &s;pirit; VIEUSSENIUS, a volatile acid &s;alt, which keeps up the fermentation of the blood; and BRYAN ROBINSON, the aerial acid, which pre&s;erves the blood from putrefaction; pre&s;erves al&s;o its den&s;ity, and &s;trengthens the animal fibres. For this rea&s;on he &s;up|po&s;es it is that we feel our&s;elves refre&s;hed in cold air, as it abounds with a more plentiful acid quality, p. 334. They who &s;uppo&s;e that nitre is taken from the air into the blood, a&s;cribe to that principle its fermentation, its heat, and its den&s;ity, p. 334.</P>
<P>It is a received opinion, that one u&s;e of the lungs is to attenuate the blood, p. 359; and MALPIGHIUS adds, that by this means, the different particles of the blood become thoroughly mixed together; while others think that the blood is conden&s;ed in the lungs; and others, that the globules, and all the finer humours, receive their con|figuration there, <HI>ibid.</HI> Some, without con&s;idering the
<PB N="7" REF="6">air as of any other u&s;e than to put the lungs in motion, think, that heat is produced in the lungs by the attrition of the blood in pa&s;&s;ing through them. <HI>Mi&s;c. Taurin.</HI> vol. V. p. 36. The red colour of the blood has been thought by &s;ome to be cau&s;ed by this attrition in the lungs; but LOWER refuted this notion, chiefly by ob&s;erving, that the attrition of the blood is greater in the mu&s;cles, from which, however, it always returns black, <HI>Ibid.</HI> vol. I. p. 74.</P>
<P>Dr. WHYTT thought there was &s;omething of a vital and &s;timulating nature derived from the air into the blood, by means of which it made the heart to contract, HALLER, vol. III. p. 336.</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE &s;ays, that air not changed is deadly; not on account of heat, rarefaction, or den&s;ity, but for &s;ome other occult cau&s;e. <HI>Mi&s;c. Taurin.</HI> vol. V. p. 30.</P>
<P>Dr. HALES, who has thrown much more light upon the doctrine of air than all his predece&s;&s;ors, was equally ignorant of the u&s;e of it in re&s;piration; and at different times &s;eems to have adopted different opinions concern|ing it.</P>
<P>In his <HI>Statical E&s;&s;ays,</HI> vol. II. p. 321. he &s;uppo&s;es, that air is rendered alcaline by breathing, and corrected, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the fumes of vinegar.</P>
<P>In agreement, as he ob&s;erves, with BOERHAAVE, he &s;ays, p. 100. that the blood acquires its warmth chiefly in the lungs, where it moves with much greater rapidity than in any other capillary ve&s;&s;els of the body, vol. II. p. 87; but that one u&s;e of the air is to cool the blood, p. 94; and he makes an e&s;timate of the degree of this refrigeration. The red colour of the globules of blood, he &s;ays, p. 88,
<PB N="8" REF="7">intimates their abounding with &s;ulphur, which makes them more &s;u&s;ceptible and retentive of heat than tho&s;e bodies which have le&s;s of it.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es, p. 102, that another great u&s;e of the lungs is to attenuate and &s;eparate the globules of blood; and that the floridne&s;s of the arterial blood above the ve|nal may, in a good mea&s;ure, be owing to the &s;trong agita|tion, friction, and comminution, which it undergoes in pa&s;&s;ing through them. In like manner, in an experiment which he made for the purpo&s;e, blood much agitated in a clo&s;e gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el was ob&s;erved to be very florid, not only on its &s;urface, but through its whole &s;ub&s;tance, as arterial blood is, vol. II. p. 102. I would ob&s;erve, however, that in this expement, the blood mu&s;t have acquired its florid colour from the air with which it was agitated.</P>
<P>He adds, that it is probable, that the blood may, in the lungs, receive &s;ome other important influence from the air, which is in &s;uch great quantities in&s;pired into them. In other places, however, he explodes the doctrine of a <HI>vivifying &s;pirit</HI> in the air. It has long, he &s;ays, been the &s;ubject of inquiry to many, to find of what u&s;e it is in re&s;piration; which, though it may in &s;ome re&s;pects be known, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we are &s;till much in the dark about it, vol. II. p. 102.</P>
<P>Suffocation, he &s;ays, vol. II. p. 271. con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the falling flat of the lungs, occa&s;ioned by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the particles of a thick noxious air, they being, in that floating &s;tate, mo&s;t ea&s;ily attracted by each other, as we find that &s;ulphur, and the ela&s;tic repelling particles of air are;
<PB N="9" REF="8">and con&s;equently unela&s;tic, &s;ulphureous, &s;aline, and other floating particles, will mo&s;t ea&s;ily coale&s;ce, whereby they are rendered too gro&s;s to enter the minute ve&s;icles, which are al&s;o much contracted, as well by the lo&s;s of the ela&s;ti|city of the confined air, as by the contraction occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulating acid &s;ulphureous vapours. And hence it is not improbable, that one great de&s;ign of nature in the &s;tructure of this important and wonderful <HI>vi&s;cus,</HI> was to frame the ve&s;icles &s;o very minute, thereby effectually to hinder the ingre&s;s of gro&s;s, feculent particles, which might be injurious to the animal economy.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, he concludes, that the effect of re&s;piration is to abate, and in part de&s;troy, the ela&s;ticity of the air; and as this was effected by &s;uphureous vapours, and he could breathe for a longer time air that had pa&s;&s;ed through cloaths dipped in a &s;olution of &s;alt of tartar, he con|cluded, that the air had been mended by the tartar hav|ing &s;trongly imbibed the &s;ulphureous, acid, and watery vapours, vol. I. p. 267.</P>
<P>HALLER, after reciting the opinions of all that had gone before him, &s;uppo&s;es, with Dr. HALES, that, in con|&s;equence of the air lo&s;ing its &s;pring in the lungs, they cannot be kept dilated; and therefore, they mu&s;t collap&s;e, and the circulation of the blood be impeded, vol. III. p. 258. When he &s;tates his opinion concerning the u&s;e of the lungs more fully, he &s;ays, that the true u&s;e of them is partly inhaling, and partly exhaling, p. 351. That the lungs inhale both water and air; but that in the lungs the air lo&s;es its ela&s;tic property, &s;o as to be ea&s;ily &s;oluble in water or vapour, p. 352.: and he thinks it
<PB N="10" REF="9">probable, that this air &s;erves as a cement to bind the earthy parts together. He al&s;o makes no doubt, but that various other matters, mi&s;cible with water, are inhaled by the lungs; and he even thinks it not improbable, that the air may carry &s;ome electric virtue along with it. The principal exhalation of the lungs, he thinks, to be water, abounding with oily, volatile, and &s;aline principles; and the&s;e oily and fetid vapours, he thinks, to be the <HI>fuligines</HI> of GALEN and other ancients, p. 354.</P>
<P>Mr. CIGNA of Turin, has given much attention to this curious &s;ubject, as appears by two Memoirs of his; one in the fir&s;t volume of the <HI>Mi&s;cellanea Taurinen&s;ia,</HI> in which he very well accounts for the florid red colour of the blood; and the other, which is a much more elaborate Memoir, intitled, <HI>De Re&s;piratione,</HI> in the fifth volume of the &s;ame work, ju&s;t publi&s;hed, or about to be publi&s;hed, the copy of the article having been &s;ent to me by the author.</P>
<P>He takes it for granted, that air which has once been breathed is unfit for farther re&s;piration, on no other ac|count than its being loaded with <HI>noxious vapours,</HI> which di&s;cover them&s;elves by a fetid &s;mell. <HI>Mi&s;c. Taurin.</HI> vol. V. p. 30. And he takes it for granted, that the ela&s;ticity of air is dimini&s;hed by re&s;piration, though he does not con&s;ider that diminution of ela&s;ticity as the cau&s;e of its noxious quality. He therefore concludes, that air which has been breathed, &s;uffocates by means of the irritation which it occa&s;ions to the lungs, by which the bronchia, and the lungs them&s;elves, are contracted, &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t the entrance of the air; and therefore, that re&s;pired air is
<PB N="11" REF="10">noxious on the &s;ame account as mephitic vapours, or tho&s;e of burning brim&s;tone, p. 31; that, in frequently breath|ing the &s;ame air, it becomes &s;o loaded with the&s;e vapours, as to excite a convul&s;ion in the lungs, and thereby render them unfit for tran&s;mitting the blood, p. 42.</P>
<P>This philo&s;opher &s;uppo&s;es that air enters the pores of the blood, retaining its ela&s;tic power, p. 50. and that it continues at re&s;t there, becau&s;e its endeavour to e&s;cape is counteracted by the equal pre&s;&s;ure of the ambient me|dium, p. 52. This air, he &s;uppo&s;es to be introduced into the blood by the chyle, and never by the way of the lungs, except when, by &s;ome means or other, the equili|brium between the air in the blood and the external air is lo&s;t, p. 57. If the external air be rarer than the inter|nal, the air in the blood, expanding it&s;elf, will inflate the animal, and have the &s;ame effect as air introduced into the veins.</P>
<P>What we are chiefly indebted to M. CIGNA for, is his deci&s;ive experiments with re&s;pect to the florid colour of the blood, which he clearly proves to be cau&s;ed by the contact of air; though he afterwards &s;eems willing to de|&s;ert that hypothe&s;is. It was often imagined, that the rea&s;on why the lower part of a quantity of blood was black, while the &s;urface was red, was, that the black par|ticles, being heavier than the re&s;t, &s;ub&s;ided to the bot|tom; but this opinion our author clearly refutes. He found, that when he put a little oil upon a quantity of blood, it remained black throughout; but that when he took away the red part, and expo&s;ed to the air the lower
<PB N="12" REF="11"><HI>laminae,</HI> which were black, they al&s;o became &s;ucce&s;&s;ively red, till the whole ma&s;s acquired that colour, <HI>Mi&s;c. Tau|rin.</HI> vol. I. p. 73. Al&s;o, at the reque&s;t of M. CIGNA, Fa|ther BECCARIA tried what would be the effect of expo&s;ing blood in <HI>vacuo;</HI> and he found, that in tho&s;e circum|&s;tances, it always continued black; but that, by expo&s;ing it again to the air, it became red, p. 68.</P>
<P>M. CIGNA concludes his fir&s;t di&s;&s;ertation with ob&s;erving, that it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay how it comes to pa&s;s, that the lower part of a ma&s;s of blood becomes black, whether by the air which it had imbibed e&s;caping from it, or by its depo&s;it|ing &s;omething &s;aline, nece&s;&s;ary to contribute to its red|ne&s;s, or by the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere; but he in|clines to think, that air mixed with blood, and interpo&s;ed between the globules, pre&s;erves its redne&s;s: but that by concreting it is expelled from it, or becomes &s;o fixed as to be incapable of making it red. This opinion, he thinks, is rendered in &s;ome mea&s;ure probable, by the in|crea&s;ed den&s;ity of concreted blood, and by the emi&s;&s;ion of air from other fluids in a concre&s;cent &s;tate, p. 74.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what he had advanced in his fir&s;t Memoir, yet in the &s;econd, which was written &s;everal years after it, he doubts whether the change of colour in the blood takes place in the lungs; but if it does, he inclines to a&s;cribe this effect to the <HI>evaporation</HI> from the blood in the lungs: and though he always found, that the co|lour of the blood was changed by the contact of air, yet when he con&s;idered that evaporation mu&s;t, as he thought, nece&s;&s;arily attend the contact of air, he imagined, that this
<PB N="13" REF="12">effect might equally be attributed to this circum&s;tance. But he acknowledges, that this hypothe&s;is ought not to be received till it be confirmed by experiments, <HI>Mi&s;c. Taurin.</HI> vol. V. p. 61.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he concludes, that the principal u&s;e of air to the <HI>blood,</HI> is to pre&s;erve the equilibrium with the ex|ternal air, and to prevent the ve&s;&s;els from being rendered unfit to tran&s;mit the blood, on account of the external pre&s;&s;ure; whereas, by means of the air they contain, the fluids move in their proper ve&s;&s;els as freely as in <HI>vacuo,</HI> and the membranes and vi&s;cera al&s;o ea&s;ily &s;lide over each other, p. 63. And with re&s;pect to the u&s;e of the <HI>lungs,</HI> &s;ince he imagined that air is not introduced into the blood by means of them, he thinks, that becau&s;e &s;uch lungs as tho&s;e of man are given to the warmer animals only, the chief u&s;e of re&s;piration is exhalation, and con&s;equently the cooling of the blood, p. 65.</P>
<P>The la&s;t writer whom I &s;hall quote upon this &s;ubject, is the late ingenious Mr. HEWSON; who &s;ays, in his <HI>Ex|perimental Inquiry into the Properties of Blood,</HI> p. 9. <Q>"As the colour of the blood is changed by air out of the body, it is pre&s;umed, that the air in the lungs is the immediate cau&s;e of the &s;ame change in the body."</Q> That this change is really produced in the lungs, he is per&s;uaded, he &s;ays, from experiments, in which he di&s;|tinctly &s;aw the blood of a more florid red in the left au|ricle of the heart than it was in the right; but how this effect is produced, he &s;ays, is not yet determined.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>Since &s;ome of the neutral &s;alts, and particularly nitre, has a &s;imilar effect on the colour of the blood; &s;ome, &s;ays he, attribute this difference to the nitre ab|&s;orbed from the air, while in the lungs. But this, he adds, is a mere hypothe&s;is, for air contains no nitre, and mo&s;t of the neutral &s;alts produce the &s;ame effect in &s;ome degree.</P>
<P>Since, however, a &s;olution of nitre does produce this effect upon blood, in&s;tantly making the very blacke&s;t of it of a beautiful florid red, though this effect is not pe|culiar to nitre (for a &s;olution of common &s;alt does nearly the &s;ame thing) I own I am inclined to a&s;cribe this effect to the air; e&s;pecially &s;ince I have proved, as I apprehend, that atmo&s;pherical air con&s;i&s;ts of earth and &s;pirit of nitre. Po&s;&s;ibly, therefore, the air we breathe may be &s;o far de|compo&s;ed, as to communicate &s;omething of nitre to the blood, in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs.</P>
<P>After this review of the ob&s;ervations and opinions of others on this important que&s;tion in phy&s;iology, I &s;hall proceed to recite my own. It may appear &s;omething ex|traordinary, that among &s;uch a variety of opinions concern|ing the u&s;e of re&s;piration, the right one &s;hould never have been &s;o much as conjectured, though un&s;upported by the proper proof. But indeed, this animal function, and the phlogi&s;tic proce&s;&s;es in chemi&s;try, e&s;pecially that of the calcination of metals, which is, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;imple of them, are to appearance very different things; and therefore, it is the le&s;s to be wondered, that no per&s;on
<PB N="15" REF="14">&s;hould have imagined, they would produce the &s;ame effect on the air in which they were performed.</P>
<P>That re&s;piration, however, is, in reality, a true phlogi&s;tic proce&s;s, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt, after its being found, that the air which has &s;erved for this purpo&s;e is left in preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;tate as that which has been ex|po&s;ed to any other phlogi&s;tic proce&s;s. And &s;ince all the blood in the body pa&s;&s;es through the lungs, and, accord|ing to Mr. HEWSON's ob&s;ervations and others, the re|markable change between the colour of the venal and arterial blood takes place there, it can hardly be doubted, that it is by means of the <HI>blood</HI> that the air becomes phlogi&s;ticated in pa&s;&s;ing through the lungs; and there|fore, that one great u&s;e of the blood mu&s;t be to di&s;charge the phlogi&s;ton with which the animal &s;y&s;tem abounds, imbibing it in the cour&s;e of its circulation, and imparting it to the air, with which it is nearly brought into contact, in the lungs; the air thus acting as the great men&s;truum for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Though I had no doubt concerning this conclu&s;ion from my former experiments, I thought &s;o great a pro|blem de&s;erved as much illu&s;tration as could be given to it; and therefore I was willing to try, whether the blood was of &s;uch a nature, as to retain any of this power of affect|ing air when congealed, and out of the body, that it has when it is fluid, and in the body; and the experiments have fully an&s;wered my expectations.</P>
<P>Having taken the blood of a &s;heep, and let it &s;tand till it was coagulated, and the &s;erum was &s;eparated from it (after which the &s;urface, being expo&s;ed to the common
<PB N="16" REF="15">air, is well known to a&s;&s;ume a florid red colour, while the in&s;ide is of a much darker red, bordering upon black) I introduced pieces of the cra&s;&s;amentum, contained in nets of open gauze, or of wire, &s;ometimes through water, and &s;ometimes through quick&s;ilver, into different kinds of air, and always found that the blacke&s;t parts a&s;&s;umed a florid red colour in common air, and more e&s;pecially in de|phlogi&s;ticated air, which is purer and more fit for re&s;pi|ration than common air (and accordingly the blood al|ways acquired a more florid colour, and the change was produced in le&s;s time in this than in common air) whereas the brighte&s;t red blood became pre&s;ently black in any kind of air that was unfit for re&s;piration, as in fixed air, inflammable air, nitrous air, or phlogi&s;ticated air; and after becoming black in the la&s;t of the&s;e kinds of air, it regained its red colour upon being again expo&s;ed to com|mon air, or dephlogi&s;ticated air; the &s;ame pieces becom|ing alternately black and red, by being transferred from phlogi&s;ticated to dephlogi&s;ticated air; and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e experiments the blood mu&s;t have parted with its phlogi&s;ton to the common air, or dephlogi&s;ticated air, and have imbibed it, and have become &s;aturated with it, when expo&s;ed to phlogi&s;ticated, nitrous, inflammable, or fixed air. The only difficulty is with re&s;pect to the fixed air; for all the other kinds certainly contain phlogi&s;ton. But, as I have ob&s;erved in the account of my experi|ments on vitriolic acid air, phlogi&s;ton &s;eems to be nece&s;|&s;ary to the con&s;titution of every kind of air; and be&s;ides, the blackne&s;s of the blood may ari&s;e from other cau&s;es
<PB N="17" REF="16">than its acquiring phlogi&s;ton. GABER, for in&s;tance, ob|&s;erves, that blood becomes black when it begins to pu|trify, as it does al&s;o whenever it is dried and hardened near the fire. Father BECCARIA al&s;o found, as I have ob|&s;erved, that red blood <HI>continued</HI> (and he could hardly fail to ob&s;erve al&s;o, that it <HI>became</HI>) black in <HI>vacuo,</HI> where it could not have imbibed phlogi&s;ton. This I found to be the ca&s;e when the blood was covered two inches and a half with &s;erum; but it regained its florid colour when it was expo&s;ed to the open air.</P>
<P>In general, however, it cannot be expected, that when blood has become black without having received phlo|gi&s;ton <HI>ab extra,</HI> it will recover its florid colour by being expo&s;ed to the air. For the delicacy of its texture, and con&s;equently its capacity of being ea&s;ily affected by phlo|gi&s;ton, may be e&s;&s;entially altered by internal cau&s;es of blackne&s;s. This is even the ca&s;e when blood has become black by being expo&s;ed to nitrous and inflammable air, though this change is probably effected by its imbibing phlogi&s;ton.</P>
<P>I expo&s;ed pieces of the &s;ame ma&s;s of red blood to the&s;e two kinds of air, and al&s;o to fixed air at the &s;ame time. They all became black; but that which was in the in|flammable air was the lea&s;t &s;o, and none of them reco|vered their florid colour in the open air. But at another time, a piece of cra&s;&s;amentum, which had become black in fixed air, did, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, and very &s;lowly, reco|ver its florid colour in dephlogi&s;ticated air. Perhaps the pieces that had lo&s;t their colour in the nitrous and
<PB N="18" REF="17">inflammable air might have recovered it by means of this more powerful men&s;truum.</P>
<P>Since, however, blood, after becoming black in phlo|gi&s;ticated air, is always capable of re&s;uming its red co|lour on being again expo&s;ed to pure air, it may be con|cluded, that the preceding blackne&s;s, di&s;charged in the pure air, and producing the con&s;tant e&s;&s;ect of phlogi&s;ton, in depraving the air, was owing to the phlogi&s;ton it had imbibed in the former &s;ituation, and which it parted with in the latter. And this is remarkably the ca&s;e when blood is transferred from phlogi&s;ticated into dephlogi&s;ti|cated air. Even the circum&s;tance of the <HI>deeper colour</HI> is &s;ufficient to give a chemi&s;t a &s;u&s;picion that it contains more phlogi&s;ton than blood of a lighter colour.</P>
<P>When I had found how readily pieces of blood changed their colour, according to the quality of the air to which they were expo&s;ed, I proceeded to examine the &s;tate of that air, in order to ob&s;erve what change had taken place in it; and as dephlogi&s;ticated air admits of a more &s;en&s;i|ble change of quality than common air, I gave it the pre|ference in this experiment; putting a piece of cra&s;&s;a|mentum, about the bigne&s;s of a walnut, into the quantity of about five ounce mea&s;ures of this air.</P>
<P>This proce&s;s I continued for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, changing the blood about ten or twelve times; after which I found the air &s;o far depraved, that whereas, at the beginning of the experiment, one mea&s;ure of it and two of nitrous air occupied the &s;pace of no more than half a mea&s;ure, the &s;ame mixtures afterwards occupied
<PB N="19" REF="18">the &s;pace of a mea&s;ure and a half. Now &s;ince air is uni|ver&s;ally depraved by phlogi&s;ton, and in this &s;en&s;e, I be|lieve, by nothing el&s;e, it is evident, that this black blood mu&s;t have communicated phlogi&s;ton to the air; and con|&s;equently its change of colour from black to a florid red mu&s;t have been occa&s;ioned by the &s;eparation of phlo|gi&s;ton from it.</P>
<P>The next day, when, of cour&s;e, the blood was nearer to a &s;tate of putrefaction, in which every kind of &s;ub|&s;tance, without exception, will injure re&s;pirable air, I put a quantity of red blood, tinged in a few places with black, which I could not ea&s;ily &s;eparate from it, to about the &s;ame quantity of the &s;ame dephlogi&s;ticated air, and &s;uffered it to &s;tand, without changing, for the &s;ame &s;pace of time; when it was &s;o little injured, that the mea&s;ures abovemen|tioned occupied the &s;pace of only two-thirds of a meafure.</P>
<P>That blood has a power of taking phlogi&s;ton from air, as well as imparting phlogi&s;ton to air, I &s;atisfied my|&s;elf by expo&s;ing blood of a very beautiful florid colour to nitrous air, inflammable air, and phlogi&s;ticated air. The two fir&s;t mentioned kinds of air were con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the proce&s;s, which was continued two days, during which time the blood had been changed five or &s;ix times.</P>
<P>The nitrous air, by this means, lo&s;t a great proportion of its power of dimini&s;hing, that is, phlogi&s;ticating, common air. For now two mea&s;ures of common air and one of this occupied the &s;pace of 2&frac14;, in&s;tead of 1&frac34; mea|&s;ures. The inflammable air, though &s;till inflammable,
<PB N="20" REF="19">was rendered in &s;ome degree whole&s;ome by the proce&s;s; being, after this, con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by nitrous air, which is a &s;tate to which it is brought by agitation in water, and which, continued longer, deprives it of its in|flammability likewi&s;e. It cannot be doubted, therefore, but that, in both the&s;e ca&s;es, the red blood, by becoming black, received phlogi&s;ton from the&s;e two kinds of air.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the phlogi&s;ticated air, I only ob&s;erved that, after a few hours expo&s;ure to the red blood, it was &s;en&s;ibly, but not much, dimini&s;hed by nitrous air, which otherwi&s;e it would not have been in the lea&s;t degree. This blood, however, was of the lighte&s;t colour; that is, according to my hypothe&s;is, the mo&s;t free from phlo|gi&s;ton, of any that I have ever &s;een; and I have tried the &s;ame thing, without &s;ucce&s;s, with blood of a le&s;s florid colour, though as florid as the common <HI>air</HI> could make it. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the proper function of the blood is not to receive phlogi&s;ton from <HI>air,</HI> not meeting with any phlogi&s;ticated air in the cour&s;e of its circula|tion, but to communicate phlogi&s;ton to air; and there|fore, there is by no means the &s;ame rea&s;on to expect, that air will be mended by red blood, as that it will be injured by black blood.</P>
<P>It may be objected to this hypothe&s;is, concerning the u&s;e of the blood, that it never comes into actual contact with the air in the lungs, but is &s;eparated from it, though as Dr. HALES &s;tates it, at the di&s;tance of no more than a thou&s;andth part of an inch. The red globules al&s;o &s;wim
<PB N="21" REF="20">in a large quantity of &s;erum, which is a fluid of a quite different nature.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the effect of the&s;e circum&s;tances, I took a large quantity of black blood, and put it into a bladder moi&s;tened with a little &s;erum, and tying it very clo&s;e, hung it in a free expo&s;ure to the air, though in a quie&s;cent &s;tate; and the next day I found, upon exami|nation, that all the lower &s;urface of the blood, which had been &s;eparated from the common air by the intervention of the bladder (which is an animal membrane, &s;imilar to that which con&s;titutes the ve&s;icles of the lungs, and is at lea&s;t as thick) and likewi&s;e a little &s;erum, had acquired a coating of a florid red colour, and as thick, I believe, as it would have acquired, if it had been immediately ex|po&s;ed to the open air; &s;o that this membrane had been no impediment to the action of the air upon the blood. In this ca&s;e it is evident to ob&s;erve, that the change of co|lour could not be owing to <HI>evaporation,</HI> as Mr. CIGNA con|jectures. This experiment I repeated, without previou&s;ly moi&s;tening the bladder, and with the very &s;ame re&s;ult.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved al&s;o, that when I cut out a piece of the cra&s;&s;amentum, and left the remainder in the ve&s;&s;el with the <HI>&s;erum,</HI> not only that part of the &s;urface which was expo&s;ed to the air, but that which was &s;urrounded with <HI>&s;erum,</HI> and even covered with it to the depth of &s;e|veral inches, acquired the florid colour; &s;o that this deep covering of &s;erum, which mu&s;t have effectually prevented all evaporation, was no more an impediment to the mu|tual action of the blood and the air, than the bladder had
<PB N="22" REF="21">been. The &s;erum of the blood, therefore, appears to be as wonderfully adapted to an&s;wer its purpo&s;e, of a vehicle for the red globules, as the red globules them&s;elves: for the &s;lighte&s;t covering of water, or <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> effectually pre|vents the blood from acquiring its florid colour; and Mr. CIGNA found that this was the ca&s;e when it was covered with oil.</P>
<P>That it is really the air, acting through the &s;erum, and not the &s;erum it&s;elf, that gives the florid colour to the blood, is clearly a&s;certained by the following experiment. I took two equal portions of black blood, and put them into equal cups, containing equal quantities of &s;erum, which covered them to the depth of half an inch. One of the&s;e cups &s;tanding in the open air, and the other being placed under an exhau&s;ted receiver, the former pre&s;ently acquired a florid colour, while the other continued twelve hours as black as at fir&s;t. Being taken out of the receiver, it &s;tood all night in the open air without becoming red, and continued black ever after, even when the &s;erum was poured off.</P>
<P>I al&s;o more completely &s;atisfied my&s;elf of the influence of the air upon the blood, through a body of &s;erum, by the rever&s;e of this experiment. For I found that red blood became black through the depth of two inches of &s;erum, when the ve&s;&s;el containing it was expo&s;ed to phlogi&s;ticated air; &s;o that the red globules of the blood both receive, and part with phlogi&s;ton by means of the air, notwith&s;tanding the interpo&s;ition of a large body of the fluid in which they naturally float.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<P>Except &s;erum, <HI>milk</HI> is the only animal fluid that I have tried, through which the air can act upon blood: for black blood became red when it was plunged in milk, in the &s;ame manner as if it had been covered with &s;erum. In urine, indeed, black blood becomes in&s;tantly red; but this is not owing to the action of the air, through the urine, but to the &s;aline nature of that fluid.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, care mu&s;t be taken to di&s;tingui&s;h the floridne&s;s with which &s;ome detached parts of a quantity of blood are tinged, from that which penetrates the &s;olid parts of it. In <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> and in water impregnated with alkaline &s;alt, fixed or volatile, and al&s;o in &s;pirit of wine, the extreme angles and edges of pieces of cra&s;&s;amentum and &s;mall detached parts, floating in tho&s;e liquors, will appear of a very florid red, while the compact ma&s;s of blood continues dark. The florid colour of the promi|nent and detached parts, in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;eems to be the mere effect of the minute divi&s;ion of the parts of the cra&s;&s;amentum in the fluid in which tho&s;e parts float; when at the &s;ame time it has no &s;uch effect on tho&s;e parts which remain compact, nor has the air the lea&s;t power of acting on the blood through the liquor.</P>
<P>I had imagined, that &s;ince black blood contains more phlogi&s;ton than red blood, that difference would have appeared in the <HI>air</HI> produced from them, either by being &s;imply di&s;&s;olved in &s;pirit of nitre, or when dried and made into a pa&s;te with that acid. But the difference was too &s;mall to be &s;en&s;ible to this kind of te&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, however, I had &s;ome blood drawn from the vein
<PB N="24" REF="23">of a &s;heep, and al&s;o took &s;ome that came fir&s;t after killing it, as the butchers u&s;ually do, by dividing the <HI>carotid</HI> ar|tery; but though I di&s;&s;olved the black part of the for|mer, and the red part of the latter, in equal quantities of the &s;ame &s;pirit of nitre, I found no &s;en&s;ible difference in the air that they yielded. The air that I got from them when dried, and made into a pa&s;te with &s;pirit of nitre, was likewi&s;e equally indi&s;tingui&s;hable. The quantity of air from this proce&s;s was very great, and was produced irregularly, as I have ob&s;erved it to have been when pro|duced by a &s;olution in &s;pirit of nitre without drying. <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Air,</HI> vol. II. p. 155. Half of this pro|duce was fixed air, and the re&s;t phlogi&s;ticated, except that a candle burned in it with a lambent blue flame. It is evident, however, from this experiment, that even the mo&s;t florid blood contains a con&s;iderable quantity of phlogi&s;ton; for, otherwi&s;e, this air would have been de|phlogi&s;ticated.</P>
<P>I would conclude this paper with ob&s;erving, that I have found a very great difference in the con&s;titution of blood with re&s;pect to its property of being affected by the influence of the air; &s;ome becoming very &s;oon of a light florid colour, and the <HI>&s;tratum</HI> of this colour &s;oon grow|ing very thick; whereas, in other ca&s;es, the colour of the blood, in the mo&s;t favourable circum&s;tances, has con|tinued much darker, and the lighter colour has never penetrated very far.</P>
<P>As the principal u&s;e of the blood &s;eems to be its power of receiving and di&s;charging phlogi&s;ton, and the degree
<PB N="25" REF="24">in which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this power is ea&s;ily a&s;certained by the eye, it might not, perhaps, be unworthy of being par|ticularly attended to by phy&s;icians. To e&s;timate the goodne&s;s of blood, according to this criterion, nothing is requi&s;ite but to ob&s;erve the lightne&s;s of the colour, and the depth of the light-coloured <HI>&s;tratum,</HI> after it has been expo&s;ed to the air for a given time. In ca&s;es in which the blood is unu&s;ually black, and but little affected by common air, it &s;hould &s;eem, that breathing a purer air might be pre&s;cribed with advantage.</P>
<P>In general, the blood that I have been able to procure in the city has not been &s;o good as that which I have got in the country; owing, perhaps, to the cattle having been much driven, and heated before they were killed.</P>
