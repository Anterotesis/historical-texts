<P>_THE next day, after dinner, the Triumvirate, being tempted by the finene&s;s of the evening, took a walk to the &s;ea beach, between two double lines of elms, planted &s;o artfully, that every tree of the outward rows, covered the interval between two of the inward ones; which &s;erved to &s;hade you, both from &s;un and wind, as effectually as if they had been

all placed in the &s;ame lines; and yet left, at the &s;ame time, the trees them&s;elves their due pro|portion of air and &s;oil, to thrive in. This avenue extended about a quarter of a mile, and was terminated by a cIump of trees, which though only nineteen in number, were &s;o in|geniou&s;ly and paradoxically placed, that they formed ju&s;t nine rows, with five trees in each<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frame a regular hexagon&mdash;in&s;cribe two equilateral triangles, draw diagonals from angle to angle, and the points, with the inter&s;ections, mark out the &s;tation of the trees.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this regular confu&s;ion, there was a &s;eat formed round the center elm, under who&s;e umbrella they &s;at down together, fixing upon that a&s;pect, which regarded the &s;ea. Here they all remained mute, for a con&s;iderable time, as that element had occa&s;ioned reflections to ari&s;e in each of their minds, which occupied their whole thoughts, in &s;ilent and &s;elf-contem|plations. At length Mr. Andrews, who by be|ing the mo&s;t certainly unhappy of the three, was therefore become more collected and com|po&s;ed, than tho&s;e who remained &s;till in &s;u&s;pence, fir&s;t broke &s;ilence, and turning to Mr. Carewe, claimed his promi&s;e, who thus readily began his &s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCVII. <HI>The &s;tory of Mr.</HI> Charles Carewe.</HEAD>
<P>MY father is, for he is &s;till alive, a gentle|man of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, in this kingdom. And my mother, who died lately, brought him a portion of five thou&s;and pounds, and was a woman of remarkable beauty. I was their fir&s;t, and only &s;on&mdash;But my mother happened, unluckily, to be delivered of me, about a fortnight before the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>As &s;uch accidents are known frequently to have happened, and that her character was irre|proachable, the world, contrary to its u&s;ual bent, refrained from all manner of cen&s;ure, upon this event. Nor did my father, who loved her as well as he was capable, &s;eem to receive the lea&s;t alarm, upon that occa&s;ion; but rather in a coar&s;e jocular manner, as was his way, ap|plauded his own prowe&s;s, as he termed it, which could bring that matter <HI>to bear,</HI> &s;uch was his quibble, in about eight months, which re|quired nine, with another.</P>
<P>However, about ten years after, he began to grow jealous and unea&s;y, about this very article, upon the following incident. A gentleman,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
who was no way related, either to him or my mother, who had lived above an hundred miles di&s;tant from us, and had never even vi&s;ited at our hou&s;e, happened to die unmarried, and left his e&s;tate, which was about a thou&s;and pounds a year, to me, appointing tru&s;tees for it, till I &s;hould become of age.</P>
<P>This per&s;on, it &s;eems, had been a lover of my mother's, before her marriage, and was well received upon tho&s;e terms, by her father; but more advantageous conditions happening to intervene, before matters had been concluded upon, &s;he was compelled by her parents, to break off her engagements there, and was im|mediately married to my father.</P>
<P>The&s;e three concurring circum&s;tances, her being wre&s;ted out of a lover's arms, the prae|maturity of my birth, with this adoption, joined all together to rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion in my father's mind, which had never once occurred to him, till the la&s;t of the&s;e unlucky circum&s;tances had happened.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t alarm, he with a precipitancy which was natural to him, and without giving my poor mother an opportunity of vindicating her&s;elf, from &s;o foul a reproach, took a &s;olemn oath that he would never &s;ee my face again, and immediately hurried me off to the tru&s;tees of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
my fortune, to be educated and maintained, out of my own <HI>patrimony,</HI> as he &s;tiled it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of this &s;tory, the cau&s;e of my excile, I knew nothing of, till &s;ome years after this event, when my mother had ob|tained leave to vi&s;it me, at the &s;chool where I had been placed by my guardians, about forty miles from my father's &s;eat. She then related to me the particulars I have ju&s;t mentioned, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he would never have informed me of, but le&s;t they might, by any chance, happen to come to my knowledge hereafter, from any other hand, and then po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion &s;ome doubts to ari&s;e in my mind, which were unworthy of her. To obviate which, &s;he im|mediately entered into a vindication of her&s;elf, with &s;uch an air of &s;incerity and virtue, that mu&s;t have removed all manner of &s;u&s;picion, from any but uncharitable and di&s;ingenuous minds.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, &s;he afforded me the extreme plea&s;ure of being informed, that &s;he had per|fectly quieted my father's unea&s;ine&s;s, by giving him every &s;atisfaction that a chri&s;tian could offer; which, with his own reflections upon the pru|dence and nicety, and of her whole conduct, ever &s;ince they had been married, had rendered him &s;o con&s;cious of the ha&s;tine&s;s and inju&s;tice of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
his &s;u&s;picions, that he declared to her, according to his rough manners, and illiberal notions, that he would actually have a&s;ked her pardon, <HI>if he was not her hu&s;band.</HI> And as for that poor fellow, Charles, &s;aid he, I am &s;orry I took that ra&s;h oath, d'ye &s;ee me, but that's pa&s;t and gone, and he mu&s;t &s;tay where he is now; for, &s;ince I have &s;worn it, let who will go to the devil for a liar, by the Lord I am re&s;olved that it &s;han't be me, d'ye mind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XCIX.</HEAD>
<P>I Remained at this &s;chool, continued Mr. Ca|rewe, till I had compleated the cour&s;e I had begun at a former one, before my bani&s;hment; and was thence removed to the univer&s;ity of Oxford; where I pa&s;&s;ed through my &s;tudies and exerci&s;es, with as much credit and &s;ucce&s;s, as mo&s;t of my cotemporaries.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay, that I applied my&s;elf to books, with the &s;ame &s;edulity that either of you, gentlemen, &s;aid he, bowing, would pro|bably have done, in &s;o advantageous a &s;ituation for letters; I was too volatile, and fond of plea|&s;ure, to ingage deeply in &s;tudy; but I had ever a certain pride of character, which notwith&s;tand|ing my di&s;&s;ipations, and the <HI>di&s;advantages of an independent fortune,</HI> propelled me always, ju&s;t to fill up the <HI>&s;triked</HI> mea&s;ure of my duties, though to &s;ay truth, I &s;eldom <HI>heaped</HI> it.</P>
<P>And in truth, the college cour&s;es there, are &s;o very ea&s;y, to any per&s;on well in&s;tructed, and
<PB N="14" REF="13">
attended to at &s;chool, that I have been fre|quently &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many young men, of &s;en&s;e and parts &s;ufficient, pa&s;s through them, or rather, <HI>pa&s;s them by,</HI> with &s;o little credit, or ad|vantage. For a per&s;on may be perfectly idle, in a moral &s;en&s;e, without being &s;o, in a literary one. Let him but diligently apply only that time, to his &s;tudies, which he cannot find room for, in his plea&s;ures, and I'll an&s;wer for it, that he &s;hall pa&s;s through all his degrees, with ea&s;e, and ho|nour too.</P>
<P>But the misfortune is, that young fellows do not, time enough, take up a &s;en&s;e of this oeco|nomy, at the beginning, and then, like other bad managers, the arrear of bu&s;ine&s;s they find on their hands, often affrights them from adju&s;ting their accounts, till it may be, perhaps, too late to retrieve either their time, or their fortunes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="100" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. C.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was at the univer&s;ity, I hap|pened to attach my&s;elf particularly, to a young man, who was of the &s;ame hall with me. He was a perfect Adonis, in face and per|&s;on.
<PB N="15" REF="14">
This, you may be certain, was a matter of no manner of con&s;equence to me; but &s;ome friendly pieces of &s;ervice, which happened to fall in my way to do him, with his &s;en&s;e and grati|tude for them, mutually endeared us to each other.</P>
<P>He was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any great logical fa|cultles, but had a refined ta&s;te for poetry, painting, mu&s;ic, and the cla&s;&s;ics; with a re|markable facility in learning languages; and he applied him&s;elf with &s;uch diligence to this <HI>&s;uper|ficial part of literature,</HI> that he could not only read French, Italian, Latin, and Greek, but &s;peak them too, with perfect ea&s;e, fluency, and correctne&s;s.</P>
<P>But in the deeper or more ab&s;tru&s;e parts of &s;tudy, &s;uch as phy&s;ics, metaphy&s;ics, and mathe|matics, in fine, through mo&s;t of the arts and &s;ciences, he was remarkably backward and flow. He u&s;ed to attend diligently indeed, all the lec|tures upon natural philo&s;ophy, on account of the experiments, which he &s;eemed pa&s;&s;ionately fond and curious about, but would very gladly have excu&s;ed him&s;elf from the rea&s;onings upon.</P>
<P>He was &s;en&s;ible of this weakne&s;s, and &s;o mor|tified at it, that he was re&s;olved to u&s;e every a&s;|&s;i&s;tance toward coquering this imbecillity; and as the&s;e were branches of learning in which I had
<PB N="16" REF="15">
happened be&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, and who was two cla&s;&s;es above him, he u&s;ed frequently to come to my chambers in a morning, or invite me to his, and intreat me to help him forward with the&s;e <HI>tough bu&s;ine&s;&s;es,</HI> as he termed them.</P>
<P>I was flattered, and he obliged, by the&s;e con|ferences; and it was this which fir&s;t founded our mutual friend&s;hip; which was afterwards farther cemented by a piece of humanity and politene&s;s, I had frequent opportunities of exerting toward him, after our union, and which I am ju&s;t go|ing to mention to you.</P>
<P>He was very lively, had a good deal of wit and frolic, and was a perfect rake too, as far as &s;itting up all night, which he would frequently do; but then he indulged him&s;elf in no other kind of exce&s;s, at the&s;e, or at any other times. He would neither drink, nor &s;cour the watch, nor ran&s;ack brothels. His amu&s;ements, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, were conver&s;ation, reading, drinking coffee, playing cards, walking by moon-light, or hiring a coach, with two or three friends, and &s;etting out at midnight, to be early enough to &s;ee &s;ome fine &s;eat or improvement, fifteen or twenty miles off.</P>
<P>But &s;ome of the idle fellows who happened to be of our parties, u&s;ed to pre&s;s him &s;ometimes, quite rudely, to join with them in their debau|cheries;
<PB N="17" REF="16">
which perceiving in him &s;uch a vir|tuous aver&s;ion to, I u&s;ed con&s;tantly to defend him from, though I was frequently too ductile my&s;elf, toward &s;uch idlene&s;s and exce&s;&s;es.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="101" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CI.</HEAD>
<P>THIS harmony had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us for about two years, when my poor friend happened to have a very aukward piece of bu&s;i|ne&s;s fall upon his hands. He had been at bil|liards, which he played remarkably well; he had much the advantage of the party; but men are not, at all times, ma&s;ters of their art, and he lo&s;t the game by one manife&s;t bad &s;troke.</P>
<P>Upon this, an ha&s;ty Welchman who &s;tood by, and had lo&s;t a few &s;hillings on a bett, &s;wore by St. Taffit, hur had played buty. My friend re|&s;ented the a&s;&s;ertion, and quick replied, that no per&s;on could have &s;u&s;pected him of &s;uch a ba&s;e|ne&s;s, who was not capable of it him&s;elf. Hur plood poiled over, at this &s;arca&s;m, and &s;natch|ing up one of the tacks, he broke it over my friend's head; who retired out of the room, with an "I &s;hall find a time, Sir."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">It was late in the evening, and the poor di&s;|comfited &s;quire retired home to his own apart|ments&mdash;He had been reared under his mo|ther's eye, who employed the curate of the pa|ri&s;h as his private tutor, in her own hou&s;e. This was by no means a proce&s;s of education likely to in&s;pire much prowe&s;s; and accordingly my pretty effeminate friend had not the lea&s;t &s;park of chivalry about him. He pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, and with very unea&s;y &s;truggles, and reflections, between the opinion of the world, and his <HI>mortal aver&s;ion to killing people.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning early, he called upon me, looked pale and di&s;turbed, told me with a trem|bling voice, the adventure of the night before, and a&s;ked my advice after what manner he &s;hould conduct him&s;elf, upon this unlucky oc|ca&s;ion. I replied, that the te&s;ty <HI>Wallian</HI> had left him but one rule of <HI>action,</HI> which was <HI>re-action,</HI> and that I was ready to carry him a challenge in&s;tantly, as there was no time to lo&s;e. That a thing of this &s;ort, &s;hould always be re&s;olved on quick, and acted bri&s;kly; for that the &s;ooner we vindicate our character, and the &s;horter time we bear re&s;entment, the better.</P>
<P>He replied that it was not for &s;uch advice he had called upon me, on this occa&s;ion; that he knew full well what the fal&s;e notions of the
<PB N="19" REF="18">
world had too &s;trongly e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;uch ca&s;es; but that his principles of morals and religion, &s;tood more &s;trongly &s;till, on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. He added, that &s;upported by the&s;e, he could mu&s;ter up philo&s;ophy &s;ufficient to with&s;tand a mere popular hi&s;s; but that this was not his &s;ole difficulty, for his whole fortune depended on the favour of his grandfather, who had already declared him heir to two thou&s;and pounds a year; but having been bred all his life in the army, and totally ignorant of any cha|racter but a military one, had compri&s;ed all worth, all virtue, in bravery alone; and had been often heard to &s;wear, <Q>by the Lord, no coward &s;hould ever inherit an acre of his e&s;tate, which had been all purcha&s;ed by the &s;word.

<P>I Cro&s;&s;ed the &s;quare directly, to the apartment of our antagoni&s;t, whom I found at break|fa&s;t, with a gentleman commoner from Llan|gefny. I told them my errand; but &s;aid at the &s;ame time, that I &s;hould not have taken this di&s;|agreeable commi&s;&s;ion upon me, only with a

I appointed the park, and the pre&s;ent minute.</P>
<P>At my return, I found my poor-&s;pirited friend in the greate&s;t agitation, both of body and mind. He a&s;ked no que&s;tion, but looked inquiry. I really pitied his di&s;tre&s;s, and was &s;o much af|fected with it, that I declare I would readily have fought the &s;ulky South Britain, my&s;elf, to have rid him of his fears and danger; but that I thought this would be only acting the bravo, and have injured my own character, without redeeming his.</P>
<P>I told him that ap Shones was a bear, that we mu&s;t take the field on the in&s;tant, that matters were unluckily come to that pa&s;s at pre&s;ent, there

For &s;hame, &s;aid I, &s;hake off this womani&s;h weakne&s;s&mdash;Arou&s;e&mdash;Be a man, &amp;c.</P>
<P>During this military oration, he made no manner of reply, but fixing his eyes upon the floor, with a kind of &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility, as if he was falling into a lethargy, muttered to him&s;elf, in allu&s;ion to my la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Would to heaven that I were either perfect man, or woman!</HI></P>
<P>This extraordinary &s;oliloquy &s;truck my ear with &s;urpri&s;e, but I had only time for this re|flection, which I &s;poke aloud, that an hermo|phrodite had neither body, nor &s;oul, worth &s;aving. While I &s;aid this, I took down a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, which I had charged the day before, on an idle affair of my own, which happened to pa&s;s luckily over, and taking my feeble <HI>Epicaene</HI> bri&s;kly under the arm, hurried <HI>it</HI> away to the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
ground, without permitting time, or power to di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We found the enemy had taken the field be|fore us, had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, were properly &s;tationed, and appointed, with their bright arms glittering in the &s;un&mdash;<HI>A terrible &s;how!</HI> As I was leading, or rather dragging my poor-&s;pirited friend up to what I judged to be the due point of di&s;tance, and before we could at|tain it, or that I could put a pi&s;tol into his hand, and retire, the ha&s;ty Welchman let fly a &s;hot between us, which however, luckily mi&s;&s;ed us both.</P>
<P>I then thought this act of ba&s;ene&s;s a ju&s;tifiable occa&s;ion for &s;aving the credit of my friend, and making the quarrel now become my own; &s;o quitting his arm, and de&s;iring him to move off to the left, I ru&s;hed up to the &s;tation, crying out, Since I find you aim at both, have at you for one. But before I could form my po&s;ture, or pre&s;ent my pi&s;tol, I &s;aw the enemy fairly wheel <HI>to the right about,</HI> and betake him&s;elf mo&s;t nimbly, to his heels.</P>
<P>Llangefny &s;puttered, cur&s;ed, &s;wore, and hol|looed after him to &s;tand hur ground like a &s;hen|tleman, but the winds and ap Shones were equally deaf and &s;wift. So turning to the &s;econd, I ju&s;t &s;aid, a flying enemy is not worth pur&s;uit,

<P>AS &s;oon as we arrived, my friend threw him&s;elf-into a chair, with an heavy &s;igh. I &s;at up all night, &s;aid he faintly&mdash;doubts and anxieties di&s;tracted me. I eat nothing all this morning, and my perturbations, with the hur|rying to and from the park, have &s;o over-powered me, that I perceive my &s;trength and &s;en&s;es beginning to fail.

<P>I caught him up in my arms, laid him on my bed, and plenteou&s;ly bedewed his pale face with water&mdash;but in vain.&mdash;I &s;earched his pockets for &s;ome <HI>eau de luce</HI> I had &s;een him &s;nuff up &s;everal

<P>I was di&s;tracted&mdash;The Welchman's &s;hot mu&s;t have taken place&mdash;I opened all his cloaths be|fore, and lifted up his &s;hirt to &s;earch the wound, but viewed a &s;potle&s;s form. No, no, the wound was re&s;erved for my heart alone. Such a poli&s;hed &s;kin! &s;uch limbs! &s;uch brea&s;ts! &s;uch a gender! I gazed enraptured on the perfect fair. An age of friend&s;hip ru&s;hed at once to love! I be&s;prink|led her lovely body all over, and the water applied to parts unu&s;ed before to cold, began &s;oon to awaken &s;en&s;e. My hopes revived, and thinking the tran&s;ition again from cool to warm, might more quickly compleat the cure, I &s;tript off my cloaths in an in&s;tant, &s;prang into bed, and en|folded her lovely body in my arms. The ro&s;es returned into her cheeks and lips, her eyes began to dawn, her breath expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in murmuring &s;ighs, and her <HI>pul&s;e beat tremblingly alive all o'er.</HI></P>
<P>Soon as her bright orbs had twinkled into life, &s;he quick perceived her &s;ituation, and endea|voured to di&s;ingage her&s;elf from my embrace. I leaped from the bed, threw my&s;elf on my knees by the &s;ide of it, intreated her forgivene&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
urged my exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, vowed ten thou&s;and years of love and con&s;tancy, then caught her again in my arms, while through a charming mixture of &s;urpri&s;e, confu&s;ion, gratitude, fear, irre&s;olution, and de&s;ire, the yielding fair one

<P>I then begged the favour of her to let me into the mi&s;tery of her extraordinary metamorpho&s;is &mdash;But fir&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, prithee let us have &s;ome breakfa&s;t.

<P>I THEN repeated to my fair chum, the re|que&s;t I had made her before breakfa&s;t, and &s;he thus readily began: My father was a cler|gyman of the dioce&s;e of &mdash; you'll excu&s;e

me; and had about three hundred pounds a year in the church, but no other patrimony. My mother was daughter to captain &mdash; you'll excu&s;e me there again, in a regiment of foot, I forget the number. She was extremely hand&s;ome, but had no fortune, and my father married her for love. She had a &s;i&s;ter, a year younger than her&s;elf, a perfect beauty, al&s;o, who was, &s;ome time after, married upon the &s;ame terms, to a gentleman of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, in the adjoining county.</P>
<P>Soon after my mother's marriage, her father was commanded abroad, and happening to be &s;tationed in the Ea&s;t Indies, where in a few years he ro&s;e to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, returned home with a fortune of near three&s;core thou&s;and pounds, which he had ama&s;&s;ed by &s;poil and plunder, among the nabobs of that coun|try.</P>
<P>When my grandfather came home, he was pre&s;ented with two grandchildren, one by my mother, and another by my aunt. They were both daughters, which di&s;appointed the old &s;ol|dier extremely. He &s;ettled a thou&s;and pounds apiece, upon each of the children, and laying out the remainder of his acqui&s;itions on the purcha&s;e of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, declared to his daughters, that he would make the fir&s;t grand|&s;on his heir. <Q>A pack of pi&s;s-kitchens, &s;aid he,

<P>This we may &s;tile a figure&mdash;not of <HI>&s;peech,</HI> in|deed&mdash;but rather, of <HI>&s;ilence;</HI> which may there|fore, not improperly be called the <HI>&s;ilent minute.</HI> This is not the <HI>hiatus,</HI> or mark of vacancy, which we &s;ometimes meet with in certain broken tracts or imperfect manu&s;cripts; but rather the &s;ign of <HI>pleona&s;m,</HI> the full &s;top; the <HI>punctum &s;tans,</HI> or <HI>conjugate point,</HI> of geometry; the <HI>punctum cri|ticum,</HI> of morals; the <HI>punctum generatum,</HI> in co|nics; the <HI>punctum &s;aliens,</HI> or <HI>punctum lachrymale,</HI> in anatomy; or the <HI>point &s;en&s;ible,</HI> in phy&s;ics, as Mr. Lock terms it. 'Tis finally, the dropping of the curtain, and clo&s;ing of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This method &s;eems to imitate the antient cho|rus of the Greek drama, which u&s;ed to hint what was not thought proper to be brought upon the &s;cene of action.

<P><PB N="32" REF="31">Therefore all rapes and murders were intirely excluded from their performances.

<P>But then, this expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>before the audience,</HI> is to be under&s;tood literally, that is, <HI>before their eyes;</HI> for where rapes or murders happened to be any way nece&s;&s;ary to the carrying on of the plot, they were always related to the public, by &s;ome <HI>by-&s;tander,</HI> in all the particulars of the action. I mean the latter, only; for as to the fir&s;t, what|ever <HI>diver&s;ion</HI> there may be, it has really &s;o little <HI>diver&s;ity</HI> in it, that it by no means, affords us variety &s;ufficient for an ingenious de&s;cription.

<P>I remember one reflection &s;he made, ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed the fla&s;k of champaigne, for &s;he drank but two gla&s;&s;es of it: Were I, &s;aid &s;he, an heathen, I &s;hould be apt to expo&s;tulate thus: If, as the &s;toics urge, all crimes be equal, why &s;hould not every vice &s;hock our nature, as much as murder does? and for my part, added &s;he, I cannot help imputing it as a &s;in to the gods, to annex the &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, to any kind of wickedne&s;s, what&s;oever.

<P>THIS &s;ame <HI>Henry,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, was my&s;elf. My mother, in the extremity of her grief upon my father's death, re&s;olving, like a cha&s;te matron as &s;he was, to live and die a widow, concluded that &s;he had then but one game to play for the fortune; and determined within her&s;elf, that let matters turn out as they might, &s;he would either bring forth a &s;on, or el&s;e im|po&s;e an heir upon her father. One &s;hould <HI>&s;huffle</HI> well who <HI>deals</HI> for an e&s;tate. The nur&s;e and midwife were bribed, and the cheat pa&s;&s;ed. For my grandfather was &s;o rejoiced, and my uncle
<PB N="36" REF="35">
&s;o mortified, at this event, that the lea&s;t thought of <HI>matriculation,</HI> never once entered into either of their heads.</P>
<P>My mother reared me with the greate&s;t cir|cum&s;pection imaginable, hardly ever &s;uffering me to be out of her &s;ight, and keeping my nur&s;e con&s;tantly to attend me, till I was fifteen years of age; which &s;o &s;candalized the old colonel, that I heard him once &s;ay to my mother, By Mars, that fellow will &s;oon beget &s;ofter brothers for him&s;elf, upon that wench there.</P>
<P>This home-bred and feminine kind of educa|tion, with the detaining me from a public &s;chool, placing me under the private tuition of an old curate of our pari&s;h, and never &s;uffering me to mix, or play with boys, u&s;ed &s;ometimes, to put the old gentleman out of patience. You'll &s;poil that child, he would &s;ay, you'll rear him a <HI>ne&s;t-cock,</HI> a coward; then fare him well, for me, for by the Lord, Madam, if ever he &s;hould betray the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of that <HI>vice</HI> and di&s;grace to my blood, I will transfer my e&s;tate from him to his cou&s;in Tommy, that boxed a great hulk of a barber's boy &s;o &s;toutly, before my face, t'other day.</P>
<P>My mother, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, would play him off with pleading the &s;lightne&s;s and tender|ne&s;s of my frame, which rendered it hazardous
<PB N="37" REF="36">
to rear me after that carele&s;s and robu&s;t manner that other boys were treated in. <Q>It was my grief for his dear father's death," &s;he would cry, "that has weakened my poor child's con|&s;titution, in the la&s;t month&mdash;Should I not then endeavour to repair the damage I have my&s;elf done him?</Q> He was tender-hearted, for he was brave, and &s;uch reflections would &s;often him.</P>
<P><Q>As for this &s;ame precious quality of cou|rage," &s;he would at other times &s;ay, "let it be ever &s;o valuable, it mu&s;t be too dearly purcha&s;ed at the price of mode&s;ty or religion, neither of which are &s;ufficiently taken care of, in the common, or what is &s;tiled the <HI>liberal education</HI> of young men, in the&s;e days.

<P>But this philo&s;ophical blunder of mine, was &s;oon after exploded, when I was about thirteen: A young fellow, who taught the guitar, hap|pened to arrive in our neighbourhood. I had a tolerable voice, and intreated of my mother that I might be &s;uffered to learn this in&s;trument, to
<PB N="39" REF="38">
accompany it, which &s;he con&s;ented to. I found a &s;ort of plea&s;ure in looking at the young man, though he was not any way remarkably hand|&s;ome; but whenever he took hold of my hands, in order to place them properly on the guitar, I u&s;ed to find my&s;elf affected with the very &s;ame kind of emotion I had before felt, when cou&s;in Tom u&s;ed to ki&s;s me. Certain private intima|tions, or inward &s;en&s;ations, I knew not what, or why, and which I could not po&s;&s;ibly re&s;olve into any manner of &s;entiment, or philo&s;ophy, what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This alarmed me extremely, I apprehended that I was contracting &s;ome dangerous di&s;order, and mentioned the&s;e unaccountable effects to my mother. She blu&s;hed, ca&s;t down her eyes, and &s;eemed to be in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion ima|ginable. I felt frightened and a&s;hamed, from &s;ympathy and filial tenderne&s;s, without being able to gue&s;s, or daring to a&s;k the rea&s;on. But the very next day, my mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed; and I declare that I felt my&s;elf plea&s;ed at it, without knowing why.</P>

<P>SOON after this event, my dear mother be|gan to decline in her health&mdash;She had been ill for &s;ome time, of a &s;low fever on her &s;pirits, which terminated in a gradual decay, under which &s;he pined for about two years. At length, finding her&s;elf drawing near her end, &s;he called me to her bed-&s;ide, wept, ble&s;&s;ed, and embra|ced me.</P>
<P>Here my fair friend poured forth a torrent of pious tears, to the memory of her mother, which interrupted her &s;tory, for that time; nor did I pre&s;s her to renew it, the re&s;t of the day. And really, gentlemen, &s;aid he, the recollection of her filial concern upon that occa&s;ion, is &s;o &s;trongly renewed, at pre&s;ent, in my own mind, that you'll excu&s;e me now, I hope, as I then did her, from pur&s;uing this &s;ubject, till to|morrow evening.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews and Mr. Beville bowed, Mr. Ca|rewe wiped his eyes, and after taking a &s;ilent turn or two, along the &s;hore, they returned home together, &s;upped, conver&s;ed, and parted.</P>

<P>THE next evening, the Triumvirate return|ing to their former &s;tation, amid&s;t the clump of elms, Mr. Carewe thus proceeded: That day, &s;aid he, I dined and &s;upped with my lovely orphan, but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my returning home to my own chambers, at night. Our liv|ing &s;o intirely together, both at bed and board, &s;aid &s;he, may po&s;&s;ibly be taken too much notice of. I confe&s;s too that I begin to feel my&s;elf a little frightened at our adventure, &s;ince this pau&s;e has given me &s;ome lei&s;ure for reflection. Be&s;ides, I really want &s;leep and re&s;t. Farewel, farewel, &s;aid &s;he, till the morning, and I will then call upon you to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>I replied, that I was neither ravi&s;her, nor bravo, that I &s;corned to take advantage of an accident, or a &s;urpri&s;e, and would never claim any other tye over her, than her own inclina|tions. But then, my charming <HI>Harriot,</HI> cried I out, and cla&s;ping her in my arms, will you not pa&s;s the <HI>day natural</HI> then with me, to-morrow? If, replied &s;he, with a &s;igh, and a &s;mile, at the &s;ame time, and pre&s;&s;ing me clo&s;e to her bo&s;om, grace &s;hall not return in &s;leep, un&s;ought for, I
<PB N="42" REF="41">
will. I bowed, &s;he bowed, then curt&s;ied&mdash;we laughed, and I retired.</P>
<P>I had now, in my turn, &s;ome lei&s;ure for my own reflections. I pa&s;&s;ed part of the night in them. I pitied her misfortune, and would re|pair it. But how? On my own part, I exa|mined well my brea&s;t, and found I loved her not. Adventure, frolic, and de&s;ire, only, had attached me to her. That my&s;tic Gordian knot, of two entwined hearts, which time it&s;elf can ne'er re&s;olve, but the &s;heers of <HI>Atropos</HI> alone mu&s;t &s;ever, was wanting here. And on her part, &s;he had &s;eemed to have acquie&s;ced too readily in the intrigue; her conver&s;ation, &s;ince that event, appeared rather too free; and though &s;he &s;till pre&s;erved her mode&s;ty, &s;he had, me|thought, re&s;igned her cha&s;tity with too &s;mall reluctance. The <HI>veni, vidi, vici,</HI> may enrich the &s;poils of war, but always impoveri&s;hes tho&s;e of love.</P>
<P>However, upon the whole, I firmly re&s;olved, at the hazard, nay the full expence both of life and fortune, to &s;teer her &s;afely through the auk|wardne&s;s of her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; to con|firm her mind, if not in female, at lea&s;t in manly virtues; and to be her friend, guide, and champion too, through every incident of life, be her future conduct what it might. For
<PB N="43" REF="42">
from me &s;he could never po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve ill, who had my&s;elf, too much unde&s;erved from her, al|ready. This re&s;olve then, &s;erving me in&s;tead of a prayer, I folded my arms, and &s;lept quietly till morning.</P>

<P>SHE came to breakfa&s;t, according to her promi&s;e, and immediately after, re-a&s;&s;umed her &s;tory. My dear <HI>daughter,</HI> &s;aid my mother&mdash; This expre&s;&s;ion both &s;urpri&s;ed, and alarmed me. I thought that &s;he had fallen into a delirium, and was ju&s;t going to expire. I threw my&s;elf on my knees by the bed-&s;ide, and taking hold of her hand, cried out, 'tis your &s;on, 'tis Henry, dear madam, you are now &s;peaking to. I know full well, replied &s;he, <HI>who</HI> you are, but alas! you little know <HI>what</HI> you are; and I am now going to un&s;old a &s;ecret to you, that will a&s;to|ni&s;h you much more, but will, at the &s;ame time, explain the propriety of that expre&s;&s;ion, which has ju&s;t now &s;urpri&s;ed you.</P>
<P>She then revealed to me the whole mi&s;tery of my metamorpho&s;e, in the manner I have before
<PB N="44" REF="43">
related it to you, and then concluded her &s;peech in the&s;e words: <Q>My dear daughter, &s;aid &s;he, for now you will give me leave to call you by that name, behold with fear and caution, the difficult and hazardous cour&s;e you have for the future, to &s;teer alone! I would have guided your little bark, and guarded this &s;e|cret from you, for &s;ome years longer, had fate permitted. But I mu&s;t now intru&s;t you to your&s;elf, at the mo&s;t dangerous time of life, without the protection of any other ma|tron, but your own &s;en&s;e and virtue. 'Tis however, &s;ome con&s;olation to my mind, to think that your pre&s;ent ma&s;k will &s;creen you from all outward perils, and I tru&s;t that tho&s;e principles, both of honour and religion, in which I have &s;o carefully educated you, even from your li&s;ping years, have by this time, &s;ufficiently &s;hielded you within.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I have taught you that religion &s;hould be our principal bu&s;ine&s;s in this life, as it will certainly become our only concern in the next. I have in&s;tructed you that cha&s;tity was a virtue, required even in a man; how much more then, mu&s;t you think it requi&s;ite, in your pre&s;ent &s;ex, when the opinion of the world, and the laws of civil &s;ociety both, join to demand it! And for this purpo&s;e, be|lieve
<PB N="45" REF="44">
me, that mode&s;ty is the &s;ure&s;t bulwark you can rai&s;e; 'tis the advanced guard, which upon being a&s;&s;aulted, gives timely notice to the citadel, for its defence.</P>
<P>With this great view then, you may have ob&s;erved that I have all along, bred you up, rather as a woman, than a man; giving you the very &s;ame education, both in morals and manners, with your &s;i&s;ter; that you might have nothing to unlearn, &s;hould you here|after, at any time, be induced to confe&s;s your real &s;ex. For ma&s;culine manners are very incompatible with female morals, as liberty in one way, is apt to extend it&s;elf in an other; and the departing from our character, in any part of our conduct, is &s;o apt to lead us a&s;tray, that we may not always be able to find our way home again.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that I have &s;ometimes repented me of this &s;tratagem," continued &s;he, "more particularly &s;ince I have fallen ill; beginning to think that this world it&s;elf, were too dearly purcha&s;ed, even with the lea&s;t deceit. But then I con&s;idered again, that my nephew will derive a very good fortune from his father, and that I have done nothing more, by this fine&s;&s;e, than e&s;tabli&s;h my own father's e&s;tate in the elde&s;t branch of his family, where by the
<PB N="46" REF="45">
rights of <HI>primogeniture,</HI> it &s;hould naturally re|main, were it not for that too partial di&s;tinc|tion between the male and female line, which I make little account of, as founded more in law, than nature; that you will, by this means, have it in your power to do more good; and la&s;tly, that to di&s;cover the &s;ecret now would be to brand my own character with an indelible &s;tain. The world would then cry, it was wickedne&s;s in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, and weakne&s;s in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I therefore recommend it to you, my dear child, &s;aid &s;he, to continue the ma&s;querade, till you come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate; when you may go out of the&s;e kingdoms, live abroad, and change your condition, as well as your garb, as you may find your&s;elf inclined hereafter.</P></Q>
<P>She then embraced me, and I parted from her in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and difficulty. I could not believe my &s;en&s;es. I &s;u&s;pected all this novel to be merely vi&s;ionary, either in my mo|ther's mind, or my own comprehen&s;ion of it. I ran to my nur&s;e, and examined her about this &s;tory, but &s;he confirmed every particular of it; and, to put the matter beyond all di&s;pute, gave me, alas! too certain demon&s;trations of my &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">The effect of this extraordinary di&s;covery in me, is not to be de&s;cribed. My &s;pirits &s;unk &s;uddenly, like tho&s;e in a <HI>thermometer,</HI> upon a chilling bla&s;t. I felt a &s;en&s;ation creeping through my veins, like an ague fit, with a &s;ort of timorou&s;|ne&s;s &s;tealing o'er my &s;houlders, like children left in the dark. I felt aukward and helple&s;s, like one who had lo&s;t a limb; I wept my <HI>fall,</HI> mourned my imperfect &s;tate, and like another Adam, blu&s;hed at the di&s;covery of my <HI>nakedne&s;s.</HI> In &s;hort, I was affected all over, rather like a per&s;on that had really &s;uffered the metamorpho|&s;is, from man to woman, than one who had been but barely informed of it. And becoming now a woman indeed, I fell from one hy&s;teric fit, into another, and laughed and cryed my&s;elf by turns, out of them again.</P>

<P>ABOUT two days after, my dear mother expired in my arms. I grew incon&s;ola|ble: A double di&s;tre&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed my mind, to lo&s;e her, and to find my&s;elf! My grandfather
<PB N="48" REF="47">
came to the hou&s;e the day &s;he died, ju&s;t time enough to give her his ble&s;&s;ing, and to bid her farewel. He lamented her, after his manner, <Q>Poor girl, &s;he was indeed a good creature! but good or bad, d'ye &s;ee me, we mu&s;t all go, one time or another.</Q></P>
<P>Then turning to me, cried, Hearkee me, youth, no more of your piping and &s;niveling now, for though you have lo&s;t a mother, d'ye mind, you have got a much better thing, which is a father, child. You have been too long tied to an apron-&s;tring already, but 'tis I that &s;hall have the management of you, now. I de&s;ign you for the army, d'ye mark me, but you &s;hall go to the colleges fir&s;t; for though I am not much book-learned my&s;elf, look you, I don't think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be a blockhead, to be a good &s;oldier. No&mdash;far from it&mdash;I have known &s;everal officers fight &s;toutly enough, though they had both &s;en&s;e and learning to boot. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, d'ye mind, is not only the bra|ve&s;t general in the world, but the compleate&s;t too, in other matters. Not that they &s;ignify, in the lea&s;t, believe me, as to the main point; but what I mean, is, that they don't hinder. As the renowned Don Quixotte &s;ays, The pen blunts not the lance&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">Now there's an example for you, my boy, fellow me that, I &s;ay&mdash;And indeed I don't doubt, but with a little of my in&s;tructions, after you have done with your books, for good and all, you may. I don't love much bragging about the matter, d'ye mind, but let me tell you, younker, for all that, <HI>I know the thing,</HI> that's certain. Nay, that's given up to me by all.</P>
<P>You may rea&s;onably conclude, &s;aid &s;he, that I was by no means in a temper of mind, to re|li&s;h all this harangue, e&s;pecially the fighting part of it; however, I looked &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, called him my father, my only parent now; and promi&s;ed him that his commands &s;hould always be the rule of my obedience.</P>
<P>He lett off the hou&s;e, brought my &s;i&s;ter and me home with him, and in about a year after, di&s;po&s;ed of her in marriage, with an additional portion of two thou&s;and pounds, to a gentleman of fortune in the neighbourhood; and placed me at this univer&s;ity, about two years ago.

<P>I Don't know how it might have &s;truck my readers, as probably few of them may be philo&s;ophers, but I affirm, that from the fir&s;t, I began to &s;u&s;pect this extraordinary per&s;onage to be a woman. <Q>He was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any great logical faculties, but had a refined ta&s;te, a facility in languages, but in the deeper &s;tudies and &s;ciences, dull and &s;low. He was fond and curious about experimental philo&s;ophy, but never troubled his head about the rea&s;ons of them,</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See chapter C. &s;econd and third paragraphs.</NOTE> Prithee are not the&s;e the characteri&s;tics of a woman? And need &s;he wear petticoats, to declare her gender.</P>
<P>Epictetus &s;ays, that <Q>attempting to catch weak minds, with &s;tudy, is like fi&s;hing for cu&s;tard, with an hook.</Q> Now I confe&s;s that this image is a very ab&s;urd one, for it conveys no &s;ort of natural idea. Hu&s;wives never throw cu&s;tards into a river, though the yellowne&s;s of the Tiber, upon the banks of which Epictetus lived, or rather <HI>&s;tarved,</HI> might have led him to imagine they did. But if they had, &s;urely no
<PB N="51" REF="50">
alderman of tho&s;e days, unle&s;s they were more &s;tupid than tho&s;e in the pre&s;ent times, which I think morally impo&s;&s;ible, would have ever thought, as well as they love them, of &s;uch an in&s;trument to catch cu&s;tard with.</P>
<P>But your antient philo&s;ophers had but &s;lob|bering notions of things, in compari&s;on of our modern adepts; and as they are generally inter|preted, more by gue&s;s, than con&s;truction, I &s;up|po&s;e the &s;en&s;e of Epictetus, to be, that women have rarely a &s;ufficient <HI>depth,</HI> for heavy lading; for that <HI>the weight which might balla&s;t a &s;hip, would &s;ink a boat.</HI> There may perhaps, have been <HI>amazons</HI> in literature, as well as in war; but all I contend for here, is, that let the <HI>Thracians,</HI> or <HI>Samothracians,</HI> boa&s;t what they will, there never was an <HI>army</HI> of them.</P>
<P>And this natural oeconomy, in the di&s;tribu|tion of parts, was certainly, mo&s;t admirably de&s;igned, by Providence. The ea&s;tern allegory conveys the hint to us, in a very ingenious man|ner. Woman, 'tis &s;aid, was formed of the &s;lighte&s;t rib of man, on the left &s;ide, which em|braced the heart. Now, by a metonymy, let us &s;ub&s;titute the heart for the rib; and this we know to be &s;en&s;ible of impre&s;&s;ion, but incapable of rea&s;on. Women therefore, were given to us, for the &s;ole purpo&s;es of <HI>feeling,</HI> and &s;he who
<PB N="52" REF="51">
would pretend to a&s;&s;ume an higher character in life, in my opinion well de&s;erves a <HI>rib-roa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Tacitus &s;ays of the Engli&s;h, when the Romans had e&s;tabli&s;hed an empire among them, <HI>Jam domiti ut pareant, nondum ut &s;erviant.</HI> They were &s;o far conquered, as to become &s;ubjects, but not &s;laves. And this &s;hould be the motto of wives. A man and his wife may be compared to the nominative and genitive ca&s;es, in gram|mar; the fir&s;t always <HI>governs,</HI> the &s;econd never. Women have confe&s;&s;edly certain <HI>privileges,</HI> but they become rebels when they would extend them to <HI>prerogatives.</HI> The Salique law&mdash;the Sa|lique law.</P>
<P>They were de&s;igned, not to harden our mo|rals, but to &s;often our manners, not to &s;tiffen our philo&s;ophy, but to relax our &s;tudies. All &s;ubjects of ta&s;te then, as Shaft&s;bury &s;ays they may be referred to <HI>&s;en&s;ation,</HI> fall properly enough within their province. Mu&s;ic, poetry, painting, dre&s;s, entertainments, &amp;c. Topics of the&s;e kinds, though we &s;hould differ about them, can never rai&s;e the heat of argument between us, &s;ufficiently high to interrupt that harmony and concord, which &s;hould ever &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the &s;exes; for you know the adage, <HI>de gu&s;tibus non, &amp;c.</HI> But &s;hould &s;ubjects of &s;cience once ari&s;e, then the argument, then the vindiction, then

Nay, even <HI>drawers</HI> are too much &mdash;They are &s;ymbolical.</P>
<P>Then again, what between her gender, and her garb, &s;he might be deemed to be neither man or woman, but both between; and <HI>between two &s;tools</HI>&mdash;You know the re&s;t of the proverb.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">But &s;he re&s;igned her cha&s;tity too ea&s;ily, you &s;ay&mdash;Perhaps &s;he could not help it. A lock ne|ver refu&s;es the key, when 'tis in order. This was an adage of Vulcan's, though &s;ome mytho|logi&s;ts, with more probability, attribute it to the black&s;mith's wife. Per&s;ons may be burned in their beds, but would it be fair to &s;tile them <HI>&s;uicremators,</HI> upon that account? The flame might be none of theirs, though the <HI>combu&s;tibles</HI> were. The &s;mell of fire, 'tis &s;aid, renders the &s;en&s;es lethargic, and 'tis too late to fly, when the flames &s;urround us.</P>
<P>Now there are flames, even &s;tronger than tho&s;e of fire; and whatever inclines, is more power|ful &s;till, than that which compels us. A re&s;i&s;t|ing combatant may wear out his antagoni&s;t, but to take away the power of re&s;i&s;tance, is a com|pleat conque&s;t indeed. Now pray con&s;ider the intire circulation of her blood &s;u&s;pended for a quarter of an hour, then &s;et a flowing again by the warmth of a young fellow's embrace; and the tepid tide ru&s;hing from the heart into all parts of the body, at once.

<P>WE lived together, for &s;ome time, in the plea&s;ante&s;t way in the world, by <HI>ming|ling love and books together,</HI> till my poor pope Joan began to perceive her&s;elf to be with child. At fir&s;t &s;he knew not what ailed her, and did not in the lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pect the truth of the matter. And in|deed how &s;hould &s;he? She was always con&s;i|dered as a boy, and therefore women never &s;poke freely before her, as 'tis po&s;&s;ible they may &s;ometimes do, among them&s;elves; and her mo|ther died, and her nur&s;e was di&s;charged, too &s;oon after the di&s;covery, to in&s;truct her in the nature of tho&s;e things.</P>
<P>And indeed, &s;he has &s;ince declared to me, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t notion, of any couple's being capacitated to beget children, except a mar|ried one. That having heard of <HI>the mi&s;tery of marriage, the wedding ring, the indi&s;&s;oluble knot,</HI> that man and wife were thereby <HI>rendered one fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. &s;he had carele&s;sly concluded, that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome &s;ort of a free ma&s;on's &s;ecret in the matter, which the prie&s;t had the &s;ole power of initiating the couple into, when he per|formed the ceremony. And that &s;he had ima|gined
<PB N="58" REF="57">
what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, might have been indeed, the uncha&s;te joys of lovers, but could really never have conceived them to have been the cha&s;te duties of the marriage rites.</P>
<P>But when &s;he was made &s;en&s;ible of her mi&s;|take, &s;he grew extremely unhappy, &s;he upbraided me &s;everely, called me &s;educer, betrayer, &amp;c. in one breath, and in another, pre&s;&s;ed me to marry her. I replied with a line in a Scotch &s;ong,
<Q>"Jockey would loo, but he wo'na marry,"</Q>
adding, that ceremony among friends, was ab|&s;urd, but to take up forms, where one &s;hould leave them off, ridiculous to the la&s;t degree. That we had really as much matrimony already between us, as might &s;atisfy any two rea&s;on|able people, and that a clau&s;e of &s;urrender, always rai&s;ed the value of any tenure. That marriage would be quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the plot that was carrying on for the e&s;tate, that it mu&s;t expo&s;e us to the nece&s;&s;ity of making a new confidant, which would certainly be too idle an hazard to run, for a bare punctilio. That I would take care to extricate her from this diffi|culty, with &s;ufficient addre&s;s, and it would be time enough then, to &s;ettle plans for future con|duct.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="58">This &s;ort of je&s;t and earne&s;t apology, &s;ilenced, though not &s;atisfied her; but &s;erved however, to render her &s;eemingly ea&s;y, for the pre&s;ent.

<P>LADIES, I am much afraid that there is one particular, in this &s;tory, which will &s;hock your faith extremely. A girl of eighteen, not to know how a womon is got with child! a probable, tale, truly! And yet I do really think
<PB N="60" REF="59">
&s;uch a thing may be very po&s;&s;ible; fir&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he affirms it; next, becau&s;e her mother and her nur&s;e guarded her equally from the conver&s;e of man and woman. And they were much in the right of it to defend particularly again&s;t the latter, for fear of a di&s;covery. 'Tis mother's maids that debauch all boys. I'll tell you the &s;tory of my fir&s;t <HI>&s;urpri&s;e,</HI> &s;ome time or other, when I am in the humour, and I a&s;&s;ure you it will en|tertain you va&s;tly. Be&s;ides, might &s;he not have read the &s;tory of Jupiter and Ganymede, the <HI>Formo&s;um pa&s;tor Corydon ardebit Alexim,</HI> the ac|count of Sappho and the Le&s;bian maids, the co|medy of <HI>Love's Labour lo&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Concubitus &s;ine Lu|tin&acirc;,</HI> &amp;c? And is not a mixture of learning, apt to breed indige&s;ted ideas, and lead one into very unphilo&s;ophical inferences?</P>
<P>And in the la&s;t place, who could ever imagine, from the mere light of nature alone, or from any manner of <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> rea&s;oning, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of <HI>experimental</HI> philo&s;ophy, or <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori</HI> evidence, that a woman could po&s;&s;ibly be got with child, <HI>&s;o ridiculou&s;ly?</HI></P>
<P>I have really known a few in&s;tances, my&s;elf, of this ignorance, in girls, who have lived <HI>very far</HI> in the country; and I remember a young lady once, of about &s;eventeen, who upon hear|ing a gro&s;s expre&s;&s;ion one day, by accident,
<PB N="61" REF="60">
came up to me, and repeating it, a&s;ked me, as a &s;cholar, what was the meaning of that <HI>hard word?</HI></P>
<P>I met lately, among &s;ome French tracts, with an authentic &s;tory of two young pea&s;ants, which I will relate to you after my own manner, not having the book by me. Take it as follows:</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="story">
<HEAD>The &s;tory of <HI>Lubin</HI> and <HI>Annete.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THEIR parents were both poor, and lived in a little village on the river Seine, in France, which con&s;i&s;ted only of their two cab|bins, and huts for their cattle. The fathers and mothers, on both &s;ides, happened to die, before <HI>Lubin</HI> was eighteen, and when <HI>Annete</HI> was about &s;ixteen. They were cou&s;in Germans, and both extremely hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>As there was no fortune, in either of their fa|milies, worth the while of guardians, executors or tru&s;tees to pillage them of, each of the heirs took peaceful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pective claims, which con&s;i&s;ted of a few cows, &s;ome &s;heep, goats and poultry, with a &s;mall vineyard, which their fathers had held in partner&s;hip before,</P>
<P>The&s;e young per&s;ons had been bred up toge|ther, from their infancy, and had contracted a mutual pa&s;&s;ion for each other, without knowing
<PB N="62" REF="61">
it; taking it to be only the u&s;ual warmth of friend&s;hip. When the la&s;t of their parents died, they joined their &s;tocks, lived in common, and in the <HI>true &s;tate of innocence,</HI> together.</P>
<P>There was a &s;mall market town, within two miles of their <HI>hamlet,</HI> to which one or the other of them u&s;ed to carry a lamb, a kid, or any thing el&s;e to &s;ell, ju&s;t as they might have them fit to di&s;po&s;e of. One day, Annete went alone to market, with a ba&s;ket of chickens on her arm. The bailiff of the town, took notice of the roundne&s;s of her wai&s;t, and a&s;ked her if any thing ailed her? No indeed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, dropping a curt&s;y, I thank you&mdash;I am as well as ever I was in my life, thank God. What makes your hips &s;well &s;o of late then, my pretty Annete? Indeed Sir, I cannot gue&s;s the rea&s;on, but I find my&s;elf growing fat every day, without knowing why, for I labour as hard as ever, and don't eat, drink, or &s;leep, a bit more than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>You are married then, I &s;uppo&s;e, replied the bailiff? No indeed, Sir. You have got a lover, my pretty Annete? No indeed, Sir. I never &s;aw one in all my life. Pray tell me who &s;leeps with you a-nights now, my pretty la&s;s? Why my cou&s;in Lubin, to be &s;ure, an&s;wered the in|nocent. Then cou&s;in Lubin is a rogue, &s;aid the bailiff, and has got you with child, my pretty
<PB N="63" REF="62">
Annete. Upon this expre&s;&s;ion &s;he &s;tared, a&s;ked how? and then clapping her hands for joy, cried out, <HI>Je ferai peute &ecirc;tre un petit Lubin!</HI></P>
<P>The fair <HI>Raravis</HI> returned home to her cottage, extremely rejoiced at this news, and chid her Lubin for not letting her into the &s;ecret before. He was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as &s;he, and declared his equal ignorance of the matter; &s;aying, 'tis an odd way truly, of getting children, by romping, and tickling one another!</P>
<P>The prie&s;t of the pari&s;h, hearing of this ex|traordinary &s;tory, came to the village, and rated them &s;oundly, about living in &s;o criminal a &s;tate together. This &s;urpri&s;ed them both, &s;till more, than the other. They replied, like &s;im|pletons and illiterates, as they were, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly imagine them&s;elves to have been guilty of any manner of crime, in what had pa&s;&s;ed. We had neither of us any envy, hatred, or malice, in what we did&mdash;we injured no body, and we plea&s;ed our&s;elves. To which Lubin added, can a &s;in, and its contrary, be both criminal, at the &s;ame time? Are we guilty in killing one per&s;on, and in bringing another into life, al&s;o?</P>
<P>Tu&s;h, tu&s;h, cried the prie&s;t, you add pre|&s;umption to your crime, by daring to rea&s;on with me. But is it po&s;&s;ible, added he, that you
<PB N="64" REF="63">
can be &s;o very ignorant, as to doubt that the bringing a ba&s;tard into the world, is a crime? The holy father then will kill it, cried out the &s;imple Annete, and leaning on Lubin's &s;houlder, wept bitterly.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t Lubin then turning to the prie&s;t, fell upon his knees, &s;aying, O father! I a&s;k God's pardon, and yours, for happening, though by mere accident, to get a child without your con&s;ents; but I am mo&s;t willing to marry my cou&s;in, this in&s;tant, in order to prevent &s;uch wickedne&s;s, for the future.</P>
<P>Son, replied the father, I am as willing as you can be, to &s;top up the gap of fornication, and lay open the gates of cha&s;tity; but 'tis proper fir&s;t, that you acquaint me, what kind of rela|tion you bear to this young woman? I think you &s;tiled her cou&s;in, a while ago? pray what degree of kindred does &s;he &s;tand in toward you?</P>
<P>Good father, replied the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lubin, Annete is my fir&s;t cou&s;in. What! cou&s;in Ger|man? Yes, father, the &s;ame. This is more unlucky &s;till, replied the prie&s;t, for it is not now in my power, any way to accommodate your misfortunes; as the church ab&s;olutely forbids all &s;uch con&s;anguineous unions.</P>
<P>Upon this la&s;t &s;entence, the unhappy innocents retired home, weeping together, to their cot|tage,
<PB N="65" REF="64">
where from &s;cruples of con&s;cience, they re&s;olved to keep &s;eparate beds, for life. They continued in this &s;tate of divorce for &s;ome time, pining away, and langui&s;hing at each other, till the lord of the manor, having been told their &s;tory, &s;ent for them both, and after examining them, and being fully convinced of their real &s;implicity and innocence, took compa&s;&s;ion on them, and obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation for them, from pope Benedict the fourteenth, to beget good catholics for the future, <HI>according to form.</HI></P>

<P>THE ingenious Mon&s;ieur Marmontel was &s;o &s;truck with this &s;tory, that he has worked it up into a pretty novel, and in&s;erted it among his writings, under the title of <HI>Hi&s;toire Veritable,</HI> in order to di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;ome others, which were only founded in fiction. In the preface to it, he &s;peaks thus: <Q>If it be dangerous, &s;ays he, to render young people too knowing, it is, on the other hand, rather more &s;o, to let them remain too ignorant; for there are offences again&s;t laws, which do not
<PB N="66" REF="65">
appear to be &s;o again&s;t nature; and I am here going to afford you one in&s;tance how far inno|cence may err, when the bandage is kept too clo&s;e upon the eyes.</Q></P>
<P>You may &s;ee, ladies, from the&s;e examples, joined to that of mother Eve, that <HI>a &s;tate of inno|cence,</HI> is <HI>a &s;tate of fall.</HI> Therefore, as I have ever known you to &s;wallow advice, <HI>as the &s;and does rain,</HI> and to keep both ears open to it, <HI>that it may go in at one, and out at the other,</HI> I would re|commend it to you to be always, as to be &s;ure you are already, <HI>innocent as doves,</HI> but <HI>wily as &s;er|pents,</HI> at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But in truth, girls, I cannot contrive what in the world to do with ye. Your mothers are quite at a lo&s;s, between freedom and re&s;traint, to know how to educate ye. It really requires a great depth in natural philo&s;ophy, for ethics will not do alone, to be able to conduct ye &s;afe through life, con&s;idering ye &s;till as free agents. Therefore women are unequal to the ta&s;k, and men are improper for it.</P>
<P>What's to be done then? for my part, I prefer the ea&s;tern manner of cloy&s;tering ye, to any other. For as women mu&s;t be &s;laves, either to <HI>opinion,</HI> or <HI>re&s;traint,</HI> I think it much le&s;s &s;everity to put their cha&s;tity out of danger, than to annex infamy to the lap&s;e of it. Women are in a pitia|able

condition indeed! our &s;ex &s;educe them, and their own preven their reformation!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>IN our new &s;ojournment we kept our&s;elves quite retired, nor ventured to &s;tir abroad, except to take a &s;hort walk in the evenings, in a walled garden which belonged to the hou&s;e where we lodged. We neither of us brought any &s;er|vants with us, from the univer&s;ity, for fear of a di&s;covery, but I hired a man, and &s;he a maid, in the village where we were &s;ituated.</P>
<P>I &s;uffered my &s;hare of anxiety, as well as &s;he, during this interval, till one night about ten o'clock, after we had &s;upped, the pains of la|bour came upon her. I called up the midwife, nur&s;e, and landlady to her, and then ran up to my own room, which lay ju&s;t over her's. Her groans pierced my ears and heart. I could not &s;tand them. I ran down the fir&s;t flight of the &s;tairs, in order to get out of the hou&s;e, but as her pains increa&s;ed, her cries became &s;o &s;hock|ing, that I had not re&s;olution enough to pa&s;s by her door&mdash;I ran back again, and locked my&s;elf in, like one pur&s;ued for a murder.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">I felt like <HI>Jaffeir,</HI> when he had betrayed his friend to the rack. I opened the window, with a de&s;ign of leaping out of it, into the garden, when I heard her &s;creeches &s;ub&s;iding to a moan, and the landlady, &s;oon after, running up &s;tairs, cried out, Your wife is &s;afe, and I wi&s;h you joy of a &s;on. I ha&s;tily opened the door, caught her in my arms, and thanked her for the joyful news, but adding, in a generous tran&s;port, <Q>'Tis well! but by Heaven I never will get her with child again, unle&s;s &s;he vexes me.</Q> The good woman cried Tu&s;h, you fool, is that the way you'll reward her labour? and ran laughing down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>This happy event much relieved both our minds, and our joy was doubled in our pre&s;ent aukward circum&s;tances, that it was not a daugh|ter. We congratulated each other upon this occa&s;ion, and as we were both of us univer&s;ity <HI>lads,</HI> we re&s;olved to have all the antient ceremo|nies performed, in honour of our <HI>terrae filius.</HI> Accordingly, on the fifth day, we pa&s;&s;ed him through the rites of the <HI>amphidromia,</HI> and ap|pointed the <HI>fe&s;tus nominalis,</HI> five days after, for his chri&s;tening; both of which were executed according to the mo&s;t exact formalities, of the Greek and Roman antiquities.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">When the curate a&s;ked me the name of the child, I an&s;wered <HI>Hermaphrodite.</HI> The par&s;on, mi&s;taking the name, for the nature of the infant, refu&s;ed to go on with the ceremony. It is not orthodox, &s;aid he, to give &s;uch a creature bap|ti&s;m. It can never be <HI>a good Chri&s;tian,</HI> that's plain. How can it <HI>make a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h?</HI> how <HI>&s;erve the Lord with all its members?</HI> how <HI>be fruitful and multiply?</HI> All which things I do af|firm to be required of a perfect Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>I laughed at the doctor's mi&s;take, and told him that this was a <HI>patro-matro-nimic,</HI> given to the &s;on of Mercury and Venus; and that I looked upon ours al&s;o, to be the child of wit and love, alluding to the mother's beauty, and my being reared in the <HI>lap of the mu&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>May be &s;o, may be &s;o, replied the doctor. I have forgot all your heathen &s;tories, intirely&mdash; An heap of idle inventions, all of them. I &s;tick to the Bible&mdash;I am &s;ure there are as extraordi|nary ones there&mdash;One need not turn to the <HI>Pan|theon,</HI> to look for them. And if they read the Bible at Oxford, in&s;tead of your Ovid's Meta|morpho&s;es, I am po&s;itively &s;ure and certain, that it would do every bit as well&mdash;nay better too, for one may learn a great deal of good out of the Bible, moreover. But Chri&s;tianity is di&s;re|garded
<PB N="70" REF="69">
now-a-days, and all our youth are bred up perfect heathens.</P>
<P>In the interim of this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the nur&s;e had &s;lily unpinned the child's rocket, &s;tripped up its flannels, and pre&s;ented it, heels foremo&s;t, to the doctor. He then put on his &s;pectacles, which he had been twirling about his thumbs, during the harangue, and after examining the in|fant, <HI>matriculatively,</HI> cried, Ay, ay, this will do; this child is within a very few words of becom|ing an excellent Chri&s;tian; and then proceeded to the con&s;ummation of it.</P>
<P>After the ceremony was over, &s;he &s;miled at my whim in the nomination of the child, but de&s;ired, le&s;t perhaps other people might be led into the &s;ame mi&s;take with the doctor, that we &s;hould &s;tick to the male part of the derivation, and &s;tile our &s;on <HI>Hermes</HI> only, for the future. This I readily agreed to, and the doctor concur|red with us, &s;aying, it certainly was a much more <HI>Chri&s;tian name,</HI> than the other.</P>
<P>During her confinement here, I never &s;tir|red from her bed-&s;ide, except when I retired to meals, or that &s;he fell into a &s;lumber; reading to and cover&s;ing with her con&s;tantly, to keep up her &s;pirits; and as we pa&s;&s;ed under the character of man and wife, and that I had changed my name, we had this &s;ame curate of
<PB N="71" REF="70">
the pari&s;h to read prayers for us, morning and evening; and when &s;he was able to &s;it up at meals, I a&s;ked him frequently to dinner, which was a great relief to us both, as &s;he was become very re&s;erved and thoughtful, and that I began to grow intolerably unea&s;y at the confinement.</P>

<P>ABOUT a fortnight after &s;he was brought to bed, gentlemen, continued Mr. Ca|rewe, an adventure happened to me, which I &s;hall relate to you here, in its proper place.</P>
<P>My landlord took me a&s;ide, one evening, and told me that there was a lady ju&s;t come to his hou&s;e, who de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. I never &s;taid to inquire who &s;he was, what &s;he was, or what her bu&s;ine&s;s? My only que&s;tion was, Where is &s;he? He led me down &s;tairs to the par|lour, and opening the door, cried, Madam, here is the gentleman you want, and retired.</P>
<P>I walked into the room, and a lady richly dre&s;&s;ed, remarkably tall, finely made, and about five and twenty, ro&s;e gracefully from her &s;eat, curt&s;ied, and moved forward. I bowed,
<PB N="72" REF="71">
and we advanced bri&s;kly toward each other, I to &s;alute her, and &s;he to &s;hut the door, which &s;he did, and bolted it too, at the &s;ame time, taking a ki&s;s <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI> Then returning to her &s;eat, and placing me clo&s;e by her, &s;he turned a very hand&s;ome face toward me, and thus began:</P>
<P>The freedom I have taken with you, Sir, mu&s;t certainly &s;urpri&s;e a &s;tranger, but the bu&s;ine&s;s I have to propo&s;e to you, will probably do &s;o much more. I have been married the&s;e &s;even years, to a gentleman in this neighbourhood; and my hu&s;band has really behaved toward me, during all that time, not indeed as well as it was po&s;&s;i|ble, but as well, I &s;uppo&s;e, as men generally do to their wives; &s;o that upon that &s;core, I have no manner of complaint again&s;t him.</P>
<P>How irk&s;ome, dear Sir, mu&s;t it then be, to a woman who has no charge to bring again&s;t an hu&s;band, on her own part, to be reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of urging one, and of the blacke&s;t dye too, again&s;t him, on a foreign account; without malice, re&s;entment, or the lea&s;t man|ner of provocation, to impel her to it.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch, however, is my unfortunate &s;itua|tion, continued &s;he, applying her handkerchief to her large blue eyes; for my hu&s;band has been lately guilty of a mo&s;t barbarous, cruel, and premeditated murder, which not only cries
<PB N="73" REF="72">
aloud to Heaven for vengeance, but to me in a mo&s;t particular manner, for ju&s;tice, as I am per|haps the &s;ole per&s;on alive, who can detect this villany, as being the only one who knows any thing of the malice praepen&s;e, which could have induced a man, in other things tolerably good, to perpetrate &s;o atrocious a crime.</P>
<P>Nothing, you may be a&s;&s;ured, dear Sir, con|tinued &s;he, could have induced me to enter into &s;uch a pro&s;ecution, but the clamorous cries of ju&s;tice, and of blood, which &s;uper&s;ede all other obligations, and make me dread the divine ven|geance on my&s;elf, as an accomplice, &s;hould I &s;uffer my ears to be &s;hut again&s;t their urgent calls.</P>
<P>You may think it extraordinary, perhaps, that I &s;hould addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, who are a &s;tranger, and a man of no power or authority, in this &s;hire. But &s;hould I have applied to any of the neighbouring ju&s;tices, I was afraid, as they are all my hu&s;band's friends, le&s;t they might privately convey an hint to him to make his e&s;cape, to lock me up, or probably, by &s;ome <HI>more effectual method,</HI> to put it out of my power ever to appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I bethought my&s;elf, therefore, of placing my|&s;elf and my cau&s;e, under your protection; for having &s;een you &s;everal times at church here,
<PB N="74" REF="73">
and taken notice of your re&s;pectable appearance, as a young man of fortune and fa&s;hion, and be|ing informed, upon inquiry, that you were come to re&s;ide, for &s;ome time, at this hou&s;e, I believed that your interfering in this matter, would not only a&s;&s;i&s;t me to obtain ju&s;tice, but al&s;o &s;creen me from the violence and re&s;entment of my hu&s;band, upon this melancholic occa&s;ion. Here &s;he clo&s;ed her charge, continuing &s;till to weep, as &s;he had done almo&s;t through the whole of her harangue.</P>
<P>I was &s;hocked, a&s;toni&s;hed, and concerned. For God's &s;ake, madam, &s;aid I, what are the particulars of this horrid murder? what inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s have you to accu&s;e him upon? or what outward circum&s;tance, to prove him guilty of the fact? Sir, replied &s;he, the body was found murdered, in a pit, and the per&s;on's hor&s;e lay killed ju&s;t by him, to prevent his running home to rai&s;e the alarm too &s;oon. My hu&s;band was the la&s;t per&s;on known to be in his company, and has for &s;ome time, &s;u&s;pected him of an in|trigue with me, &s;ince which &s;urmi&s;e he has never &s;uffered him to come within his doors, bearing him con&s;tant grudge, and deadly malice.</P>

<P>I Told her that I did not &s;ee &s;ufficient grounds, upon the whole of the &s;tory, to take away a man's life, who had any rank or character in the world; but your internal evi|dence, madam, &s;aid I, which &s;eems the mo&s;t material, with you, will never &s;way, nor ought it, with a jury. I therefore advi&s;ed her to return home, to &s;ay nothing of her intended pro&s;ecu|tion, which &s;hould for ever be buried in &s;ilence with me, to leave the detection of this crime to Providence, and the puni&s;hment of it to the laws; for that, if there was any foundation, from facts or circum&s;tances, to charge the mur|der upon her hu&s;band, there would probably, &s;oon ari&s;e more natural and unque&s;tionable pro|&s;ecutors again&s;t him, than a &s;u&s;pected, and pro|voked wife could ever po&s;&s;ibly be deemed.</P>
<P>What effect can your evidence probably have, added I, except to fix the indelible &s;tain upon your own character, of two the mo&s;t abomina|ble and unju&s;tifiable crimes in nature; an of|fence again&s;t an hu&s;band's bed, and an attempt upon his life? The fir&s;t may ever remain pro|blematical, if the latter does not add demon&s;tra|tion to it. <HI>The adultre&s;s will hunt for the precious
<PB N="76" REF="75">
life.</HI> And with regard to him, continued I, it mu&s;t rather &s;erve to acquit, than condemn him; for the very cau&s;e of your &s;u&s;picion, may in &s;ome &s;ort, be deemed the rea&s;on of his excu&s;e.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t injury and mortification a man can po&s;&s;ibly receive, went I on, is from an of|fence of this nature&mdash;The re&s;entment and pro|vocation mu&s;t therefore, ri&s;e, in proportion to the wrong. This is &s;o well under&s;tood, and ad|mitted of, by legi&s;lators, continued I, that there is always an indulgence &s;hewn, in the admini|&s;tration of the laws, upon the fatal effects of any &s;udden tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But per&s;ons may not always be able, or &s;uf|ciently prepared, to execute their re&s;entment, upon the fir&s;t di&s;covery; and as the Chri&s;tian <HI>code</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the Jewi&s;h laws the adulterer and adultre&s;s, were both &s;toned to death.</NOTE> has not thought proper to adequate a pe|nalty to the offence&mdash;for what are fines or impri&s;onment, to a man's own &s;en&s;e of the wrong?&mdash;I really think that a re&s;entment, &s;hewn upon the fir&s;t opportunity, as well as upon the fir&s;t provocation, may be perfectly agreeable to rea&s;on, though not, it &s;eems, to law. <HI>He will not regard any ran&s;om, neither will he re&s;t content, though thou give&s;t many gifts.</HI> Nor may this be deemed of the nature of malice praepen&s;e, nei|ther,
<PB N="77" REF="76">
while the injury continues &s;till in&s;tant to the &s;oul, and that the &s;en&s;e of it may rather gain &s;trength, from reflection. For <HI>jealou&s;y is the rage of a man, therefore he will not &s;pare, in the day of vengeance.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to &s;um up all, madam, &s;aid I, and ri&s;ing from my &s;eat, give me leave to add, that the ju&s;tice which you &s;ay, and which I &s;hall &s;till pre&s;erve charity enough to pre&s;ume you are actuated by, is much mi&s;taken in this point; for there are, believe me, let the &s;toics urge what they will, certain duties, within duties, which may render that action, which would be ju&s;t in one, unju&s;tifiable in another.</P>

<P>SHE &s;eemed extremely confounded, ro&s;e and walked toward the window, wiped her eyes, and then turning about to me, with a con&s;trained compo&s;ure in her air; So young a preacher, &s;aid &s;he, I have never heard before, and you may be an orthodox one too, for aught I know; but this I am &s;ure of, that after the &s;teps I have already ta|ken, this day, in fir&s;t charging my hu&s;band with
<PB N="78" REF="77">
the murder, and then eloping from him, it is now too late for me to think of returning home again. Even &s;hould he receive me, how could it be po&s;&s;ible for us ever to live on any terms, together, after his having &s;u&s;pected me of adul|tery, and my accu&s;ing him of murder!</P>
<P>I have therefore no re&s;ource left me now, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, and countenance full of di&s;tre&s;s, but to pur&s;ue this point, at lea&s;t &s;o far, as to frighten him into &s;ome terms of &s;eparate mainte|nance; which, after what you have &s;aid to me, upon this extraordinary occa&s;ion, &s;hall, I a&s;&s;ure you, be the utmo&s;t of my malice again&s;t him. And &s;urely, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, catching hold of my hand, and falling on her knees before me, you will not refu&s;e me your humane and generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as may be requi&s;ite to extricate an unfortunate woman, out of &s;o &s;hock|ing a dilemma.</P>
<P>I rai&s;ed her up in my arms, and&mdash;I am quite a&s;hamed of it, gentlemen, &s;aid he, looking at Andrews and Beville&mdash;I could not refrain from embracing her. I had really conceived the mo&s;t virtuous abhorrence, of her crimes, but&mdash;I don't know how it was, I found the ki&s;&s;ing her, mo&s;t wickedly plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>I then promi&s;ed to take her per&s;on under my protection, though I would not patronize her vice;
<PB N="79" REF="78">
and telling her that it would not be proper for me to be &s;een any more in her company, for the remainder of that evening, I left her in the care of my landlady, and retired to &s;ee how my fair invalid had re&s;ted &s;ince I had parted from her.</P>
<P>I found her ju&s;t awakened from a refre&s;hing &s;lumber, and with that &s;teady calm temper which &s;he had con&s;tantly pre&s;erved, through the whole cour&s;e of her confinement in this place. She was thoughtful, but not grave; ea&s;y, though not gay; and had that kind of even chearfulne&s;s always about her, which flows rather from a compo&s;ure of mind, than a mirthfulne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>I did not mention a word of my adventure below &s;tairs, and had given the &s;ame caution to the whole hou&s;e, as I was afraid that the &s;hock|ing circum&s;tances of the &s;tory, might have too much affected the weakne&s;s of her &s;pirits, in her pre&s;ent invalid &s;tate; and that po&s;&s;ibly, it might have alarmed her with a little jealou&s;y, al&s;o, as there was &s;ufficient rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the lady's chief concern about the matter, might have been for the lo&s;s of one galant, and her principal end in applying her&s;elf to me, be for the compa&s;&s;ing another.</P>
<P>I &s;at and conver&s;ed with her, till her nur&s;e-tender di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, and then retired up &s;tairs
<PB N="80" REF="79">
to my own apartment, read for an hour or two, and went &s;upperle&s;s to bed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="122" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXXII.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, about eight o'clock, I was awakened by &s;ome body coming into my chamber; and as I never &s;hut the windows, at night, in order to ri&s;e early, I perceived a gentleman whom I had never &s;een before, walk into the room, in boots, with a pale, frightened look, and a pi&s;tol in each hand. I called out to him to &s;tand, and declare his bu&s;ine&s;s, in&s;tantly, or I would fire at him; leaping into the floor, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bed, and &s;natching up one of my pi&s;tols, which lay on a chair, ju&s;t by it.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered me as quick as I could &s;peak, in the&s;e words: Dear Sir, I a&s;k pardon for this abrupt appearance, and be a&s;&s;ured that I wear not the&s;e arms, to offend you, but to defend my&s;elf; and &s;o far from meaning to a&s;&s;ault you, Sir, I am rather come hither to require your protection. I then de&s;ired him to lay down his arms, on the table, and take his &s;eat, till I
<PB N="81" REF="80">
&s;hould have put on my cloaths. He did &s;o, but while I was dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, proceeded thus:</P>
<P>I am come, Sir, &s;aid he, to compleat the adventure you had with a certain lady, ye&s;ter|day evening. I am, alas! the unfortunate hu&s;|band of that wicked woman, who in revenge for my not having repudiated her, &s;ome time &s;ince, which I am now convinced &s;he was di&s;appointed in, is at pre&s;ent, endeavouring to &s;et her&s;elf free from the marriage chain, by the mo&s;t diabolical &s;tratagem, imaginable. She eloped from me, ye&s;terday evening, continued he, after &s;ome very warm expre&s;&s;ions, on both &s;ides, &s;he quit|ted the room in a rage, and left me in &s;uch a&s;to|ni&s;hment and confu&s;ion, that I did not know &s;he had gone away from my hou&s;e, till the bell rang for &s;upper.</P>
<P>I then &s;ent &s;ervants all round the neighbour|hood, to inquire after her, and about five o'clock this morning, one of them returned back and informed me, that &s;he had been &s;een alighting at this hou&s;e, from behind a tenant of mine, who lives in a little village near me. I was &s;till &s;it|ting up, &s;o mounted my hor&s;e, and rode off di|rectly hither.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I arrived, I inquired from the landlord, what he knew about her, and he told
<PB N="82" REF="81">
me that when &s;he came to his hou&s;e &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with the gentleman &s;tranger who lodged here, that he immediately introduced you, Sir, to her, and then left you together, in the parlour; that you remained there but about half an hour, and then retired up &s;tairs to your own apartments, for the remainder of the night.</P>
<P>I then de&s;ired him to &s;hew me the chamber where &s;he lay, and having left my pi&s;tols in his charge, for fear of alarming her, I went &s;oftly into the room, opened the window-&s;hutters, and then going to the bed-&s;ide, gently put a&s;ide the curtain, to &s;ee if &s;he was awake. She opened her eyes, ju&s;t at the time, looked at me for half a minute, before &s;he could recollect her&s;elf, then &s;hrieked out, and hid her head under the cloaths.</P>
<P>I &s;at down by the bed-&s;ide, and de&s;ired her to be under no manner of apprehen&s;ion of any vio|lence from me, that I only came to expo&s;tulate with her, calmly, upon her ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ions, and precipitate flight; and al&s;o de&s;ired to know, how far &s;he intended to carry her wickedne&s;s and di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>She then uncovered her head, and with a &s;teady countenance, replied, that &s;he really deemed me a murderer, and had therefore fled from my hou&s;e, in fear of her own life; that, on the
<PB N="83" REF="82">
way, her con&s;cience had urged her to a pro&s;ecu|tion again&s;t me, and that de&s;pairing of ju&s;tice, from any of my own <HI>quorum,</HI> &s;he had applied to a &s;tranger, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who had generou&s;ly promi&s;ed it to her.</P>
<P>By this time I was dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;itting down by him, repeated to him all the circum&s;tances of the charge his wife had brought again&s;t him. I told him that there was certainly foundation enough, to put him upon his tryal, at lea&s;t, that guilty, or not, this affair mu&s;t be attended with con&s;iderable &s;candal, trouble, expence, and ha|zard. But that be he criminal, or be he not, taking all circum&s;tances together, I compa&s;|&s;ionated his unhappy &s;ituation, and if he would candidly relate to me the whole truth of the &s;tory, I would be his friend, &s;o far, as to put a &s;top to the iniquitous and unnatural pro&s;ecution, on his wife's part.</P>
<P>Sir, replied he, with an expre&s;&s;ion of joy and &s;urpri&s;e in his countenance, your genero&s;ity and humanity have won a &s;ecret from me, which I never &s;hould, nor indeed ought to have revealed, to any other per&s;on breathing; but now, &s;aid he, ri&s;ing, and lifting up his hands and eyes to the ceiling, with the &s;ame &s;incerity with which I in|treat of Heaven forgivene&s;s for my offence, I will confe&s;s my crime, in this article, fully to

you. So &s;aying, he returned to his &s;eat, and thus began:</P>

<P>MY father died &s;oon after I became of age, and left me, who was his only child, a clear e&s;tate, of about a thou&s;and pounds a year. I lived an idle, debauched life, like other young men, till I was two and thirty. At that unlucky aera, I fir&s;t &s;aw this woman, fell in love, and married her, without a fortune.</P>
<P>She was then, about eighteen, and from what &s;he appears to be this day, one may ea&s;ily judge what a charming per&s;on &s;he mu&s;t have been, at that age. We lived in perfect harmony together, for near &s;ix years, during which interval, &s;he bore me one &s;on, and a daughter.</P>
<P>About a year ago, and near the unhappy end of this too happy period, a gentleman arrived from the univer&s;ity, at his &s;eat about four or five miles di&s;tant from me. As this is a neighbour|hood in the country, and that I had been for|merly well acquainted with his father, I paid in due cour&s;e, the fir&s;t vi&s;it to him.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="84">He was a young man, of about two and twenty, not hand&s;ome, but of a genteel per&s;on, and had that peculiar ea&s;y air about him, which denotes both birth and breeding. He was hardly endowed with even a moderate &s;hare of under|&s;tanding, but had that kind of liveline&s;s, and nonchalance in his manners, which is too apt to captivate women, becau&s;e it does not alarm them &s;ufficiently to put them&s;elves upon their guard.</P>
<P>In about a month after, he returned my vi&s;it, and &s;taid a week with us. He was all frolic, and di&s;&s;ipation. He gave a &s;hift, to be run for by the girls of the village, a hat, to be cudgeled for, a &s;addle, for a hor&s;e-race, and tobacco, to be grinned for by old women. He made me &s;end for a fiddler, and &s;ummon all the young people in the neighbourhood, to a ball; and u&s;ed to din our ears, in the morning, with the noi&s;e of his hounds, and French horns.</P>
<P>He gave us an invitation at parting, and in a few days, we returned his vi&s;it. The &s;ame kind of active idlene&s;s and extravagance, continued while we &s;taid there. Strange, giddy creature! my wife would &s;ometimes &s;ay, he is as innocent and unde&s;igning, as an infant&mdash;but he will run through his fortune and con&s;titution, as other young heirs do, before he has given him&s;elf time
<PB N="86" REF="85">
for the enjoyment of either. A friend, &s;uch as you are, &s;he would add, who has &s;o much the <HI>advantage</HI> of him, in years and &s;obriety, mu&s;t be of va&s;t &s;ervice, to prevent his falling into the hands of harlots, and &s;harpers. I thought as &s;he &s;poke, and therefore incouraged a frequent in|tercour&s;e between us.</P>

<P>I Have &s;eldom known a good end come of inmates, of this kind, in a man's hou&s;e. The hu&s;band is &s;ometimes en de&s;habille, both in temper, and habit. The friend always decked out, in dre&s;s and chearfulne&s;s. The hu&s;band carele&s;s, the friend attentive&mdash;the hu&s;|band old, and the friend new. Novelty and compari&s;on give the advantage. Freedoms in|crea&s;e, and it is never fafe for a woman to be familiar, but with her husband. There are cer|tain periods in female virtue, which philo&s;ophers &s;tile <HI>critical minutes,</HI> when cha&s;tity, by long watching, I &s;uppo&s;e, begins to nod, and the
<PB N="87" REF="86">
clo&s;e be&s;ieger mu&s;t, &s;ooner or later, catch her off her guard.</P>
<P>An old and faithful &s;ervant, who had been butler to my father, and continued in the &s;ame &s;tation, with me, came to me, one day, about a month ago, and after a good deal of he&s;ita|tion and difficulty, gave me &s;ome hints of a criminal intercour&s;e, between my wife and <HI>my friend.</HI> I caught fire, and in a peremptory tone, commanded him to reveal all his knowledge in that affair, without the lea&s;t re&s;ervation or di&s;|gui&s;e.</P>
<P>He then told me, that the morning before, as he was going to wind up the clock, on the &s;tair|ca&s;e, he &s;aw him going into his mi&s;tre&s;s's bed-chamber. I was &s;urpri&s;ed, at fir&s;t, &s;aid the poor old man; but con&s;idering his free carele&s;s man|ner, that he might not have known your ho|nour was up, and called in to rou&s;e you, or might have imagined &s;he her&s;elf was up, and have gone in to hurry her to breakfa&s;t, I did not harbour much &s;u&s;picion, at that time; e&s;pecially as I &s;aw you all, &s;oon after, at the tea-table, together, and that I did not perceive the lea&s;t manner of guilt, in either of their countenances, which I &s;uppo&s;ed that no wicked per&s;ons could ever di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="87">But, this morning, continued he, as I was coming down from my own room, later than u&s;ual, with my &s;hoes in my hand, to avoid making a noi&s;e as I pa&s;&s;ed by your door, I per|ceived him again coming out of my mi&s;tre&s;s's chamber, upon which I turned back, for a while, to let him pa&s;s by, as if unnoticed. I then be|gan to grow unea&s;y in my mind, &s;aid he, and thought it my duty to inform your wor&s;hip, of &s;uch practices.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck dumb for &s;ome minutes, and then directed him to lie on the lurch, the next morning, and the moment he &s;hould &s;ee him go into the room, to come and acquaint me of it. I went immediately into the clo&s;et, and charged my pi&s;tols, afre&s;h. I endeavoured to appear ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, all that day; I did not &s;tir out, indeed, but walked about the par|lour, humming a tune, or &s;at in the window, reading a pamphlet, till dinner. In the evening, we played parties of picket together, and I took notice of many freedoms between them, both in words and action. Catching hold of her hand, when &s;he cut the cards, or pre&s;ented them to him to be dealt. Free &s;peech&punc; and arch looks; with other ribaldry, of the &s;ame &s;ort. Such impertinences might have pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed, at another time, but <HI>trifles light as air,</HI> &amp;c. We
<PB N="89" REF="88">
&s;upped, and parted, about eleven o'clock, all in &s;eeming harmony.</P>
<P>The anxiety of that night, is not to be ima|gined. I doubted, I believed&mdash;I he&s;itated, I re&s;olved&mdash;I hoped, and I de&s;paired. I recollec|ted a thou&s;and circum&s;tances, to think her inno|cent&mdash;a thou&s;and others, to deem her guilty. Her touch digu&s;ted me. I lay on the &s;tock of the bed, &s;lept little, and waked in a perfect fever. She &s;lept &s;ound, and did not in the lea&s;t, per|ceive my di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The next morning, I ro&s;e early, in order to give iniquity fair play, and retired to my &s;tudy; where I waited with impatience, till my confi|dent came to tell me, that my wife was come down to breakfa&s;t, and he had not ob&s;erved any thing, of what he had lain in wait for, though he had kept his &s;tation, ever &s;ince he heard me go down &s;tairs, till that every moment.</P>
<P>O Sir! cried he out, at this period of his di&s;|cour&s;e, is it not a &s;hocking thing to &s;ay, that I felt my&s;elf di&s;appointed, at this report! but &s;uch, however, was my wretched &s;ituation. Delayed revenge is like a late fea&s;t, the appetite palls upon it. This day pa&s;&s;ed over, in the &s;ame manner as the foregoing.</P>

<P>THE next morning, the butler came run|ning to me out of breath, and told me he had ju&s;t then, &s;een him go into the chamber. I de&s;ired him to remain upon the &s;pot I left him, till I &s;hould call him up. I walked up &s;tairs, di|rectly, went into the room, with a pi&s;tol in my hand, and &s;hut the door after me. 'Tis too late to hide your ba&s;ene&s;s now, villain, &s;aid I, in a low voice, but I will, notwith&s;tanding, &s;pare your life. Ri&s;e in&s;tantly, open the window, and leap out into the garden; then return into the hou&s;e, call for breakfa&s;t, and leave the re&s;t to me.</P>
<P>He flew to obey my commands, and as &s;oon as I had &s;hut down the window after him, I opened the door, and going to the &s;tair-head, called up John. Friend, &s;aid I, I cannot find him here, but do you go in and &s;eek for him. He declined it, till I pre&s;ented the pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t. He then &s;earched the room diligently, and upon his di&s;appointment, looked agha&s;t, and trembled.</P>
<P>Old man, &s;aid I, fear nothing; your infor|mation has &s;hewn an hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition in you,
<PB N="91" REF="90">
but your eyes begin to fail you. You mu&s;t have mi&s;taken me, who might have gone in and out, the two former mornings, and this day you mu&s;t have taken one of the maids for a galant. The poor fellow then threw him&s;elf upon his knees, acknowledged his error, crying, that three&s;core and ten had rarely eyes to be depended upon, and intreated forgivene&s;s, both of God, and us.</P>
<P>I granted his pardon, &s;aid I would intercede with his mi&s;tre&s;s, bid him never mention a word of the affair, and de&s;ired him to go down &s;tairs, and lay the tea-table. But how was his &s;urpri&s;e augmented, and his mi&s;take confirmed, when he met the gentleman in the parlour, and intreating for breakfa&s;t, &s;aying that he was obliged to &s;et out for London, that very morn|ing.</P>
<P>I then returned into the chamber, where my wife had lain &s;ilent, and motionle&s;s, during the whole tran&s;action. She ro&s;e up, on her knees, conjuring me to believe her innocent, the truth of which &s;he offered to certify to me, by the mo&s;t &s;acred oath. She &s;aid that the young man had always a giddy free romping way with him, which &s;he had frequently reprimanded him for, and had finally threatened to inform me of it, if he &s;hould continue his impertinence. But that in
<PB N="92" REF="91">
thought, word or deed, a ve&s;tal was not purer than &s;he, and then bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>I replied, that I hoped, for my own &s;ake, and had charity enough to believe, for hers too, that no criminal intercour&s;e had ever pa&s;&s;ed between them; that her indi&s;cretions had been indeed, almo&s;t unpardonable, but that I had given &s;uf|ficient proof of my having deemed them only &s;uch, by my command of temper, upon this trying occa&s;ion, with the &s;tratagem I had made u&s;e of, in order to &s;creen her character even from a footman's cen&s;ure; and that I hoped her con|duct would thenceforth, become thoroughly re|formed, from a grateful &s;en&s;e, of my behaviour, and a proper condemnation, of her own.</P>
<P>She did not come down to breakfa&s;t, but after the table was removed, and the coa&s;t clear, the gentleman made me many a&s;&s;everations, and &s;wore all the u&s;ual oaths, of <HI>men of honour,</HI> upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. To which I an&s;wered, that my wife's innocence re&s;ted not upon his ju&s;tification, that I dared not even to think her guilty, though I believed him to be a villain, which I would then re&s;ent, more emphatically by deeds, than words, if the regard I had already &s;hewn by my late contrivance, toward her character, had not reprieved him from my vengeance. He ac|knowledged
<PB N="93" REF="92">
his inho&s;pitality, a&s;ked my pardon, and retired with precipitation, and confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>MY behaviour, upon this occa&s;ion, con|tinued he, mu&s;t appear very extraordi|nary, to you, and &s;o indeed it was; but my rea&s;ons for it, were the&s;e: Had I found them together, the fir&s;t day, as I expected, I &s;hould certainly have &s;hot him through the head, and might probably, have di&s;patched her too, imme|diately after him. But the di&s;appointment, and the interval, had given me time for reflection. My re&s;entment was by no means abated; but my prudence and my pride, had tied down its hands.</P>
<P>I did not think her actually guilty, at that time, though her behaviour &s;ince, and at pre|&s;ent, has now fully convinced me that &s;he was. There are a &s;ort of women, who from a &s;hame|ful neglect in their education, will too freely give, and take, improper liberties; thinking it &s;ufficient virtue to ab&s;tain from mere <HI>matter of
<PB N="94" REF="93">
fact.</HI> I have &s;een women &s;ometimes, handle and pre&s;ent a pi&s;tol, out of a bravo, who would be terrified to death, at the thoughts of letting it off. I hoped the be&s;t, and imagined &s;he might be one of the&s;e. Though, after all, where is the dif|ference, between a wife who is really, or only &s;eemingly guilty? If, as the ver&s;e &s;ays,
<Q>"She &s;till is virtuous, if &s;he &s;o is deem'd,"</Q>
the rever&s;e of this maxim has, I am &s;ure, much greater truth in it.</P>
<P>In the next place, the thoughts of my dear children, came acro&s;s my mind. I believed them both my own, and loved them, with a true father's fondne&s;s. Could I then think of expo|&s;ing their mother, the mother of my daughter more particularly, to infamy? <HI>for a mother in di&s;honour, is a reproach to the children.</HI> My own pride al&s;o, came in bar, on the apprehen&s;ion that &s;uch misfortunes, from the unrea&s;onable and unaccountable opinions of the world, gene|rally occa&s;ion a man to fall into contempt.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations, joined together, ope|rated upon my mind, and wrought my temper to that calm conduct, which I manife&s;ted upon this mortifying occa&s;ion. They governed my behaviour toward her al&s;o, for there is certainly no medium, between &s;eeming to think a wife
<PB N="95" REF="94">
guilty, and turning her out of doors; and it hurt my pride le&s;s, to appear credulous, than tame.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="127" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>MY wife did not, by any means, behave properly, upon this cri&s;is, though po&s;&s;ibly &s;he meant to do &s;o; &s;he was very ill-tempered, and in&s;olent, perhaps from imagining that mild|ne&s;s and humility, might argue a &s;en&s;e of guilt; and rendered the poor old butler &s;o unea&s;y in his &s;ervice, that he gave me warning, in a week after this adventure; which obliged me to di&s;|charge him, and &s;ettle an annuity on him, for life.</P>
<P>Thus matters went on, a little aukwardly, be|tween us, for about three weeks, till the day be|fore ye&s;terday; when I happened to go to dine at a neighbour's, in a free way, without invita|tion, or knowing who were to be of his com|pany. There I chanced, mo&s;t unluckily, to meet the per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent tragedy. We took no manner of notice of each other, which however, being in a mixed com|pany,
<PB N="96" REF="95">
was not ob&s;erved. The bottle went bri&s;kly about, and I drank hard, and in an ill temper, which is always a dangerous thing.</P>
<P>When we broke up, and came to mount our hor&s;es, this gentleman's &s;ervants were out of the way. He was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;tay, and an&s;wered, that he was under an engagement to &s;ome com|pany at his own hou&s;e, that night, but lamented the want of one of his men, whom he called his guide, as he knew the road, acro&s;s the country, and that it was now late, and dark. No matter for that, replied our ho&s;t, follow your friend, there, &s;aid he, pointing to me, to his avenue-gate, 'tis not half a mile about, and it is &s;trange if you are not able to find the way from thence, which you have been galloping to and fro, both night and day, for the&s;e twelve months pa&s;t.</P>
<P>This unlucky reflection increa&s;ed my rancour. I made no manner of reply to the propo&s;ition, but mounting my hor&s;e, bowed to the gentle|man of the hou&s;e, and rode off. This ab&s;urd per&s;on followed me. I was piqued at it. It ap|peared a fre&s;h in&s;ult. It was making too &s;light of my re&s;entment. I mended my pace to get rid of him, but he pur&s;ued me &s;till. I had not the lea&s;t thought of it, the in&s;tant before. I am con|vinced that this may have been often the ca&s;e. People &s;hould be particularly careful therefore,
<PB N="97" REF="96">
never to indulge, as we are too apt to do, that malice, or habit of mind, which may temper them for a crime that opportunity, or the devil, may &s;uddenly tempt them to.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when we came to a certain pa&s;s, I turned into a field, and pulling up my bridle, cried out to him, I have taken the lead from you, long enough&mdash;I now re&s;ign it to you. Pu&s;h away, acro&s;s this fair field, and we &s;hall recover the road again, at the end of it. He clapped &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and in an in&s;tant I heard them both, in full &s;peed, fall tumbling down the precipice. I li&s;tened for a minute, but heard neither mo|tion or groan, from man or bea&s;t. I was &s;truck with horror&mdash;I grew &s;ober in a moment&mdash;I re|pented too late. And through the awful &s;ilence, and horrid darkne&s;s of the night, rode home a wretch indeed!</P>
<P>This, Sir, concluded he, is the intire truth, and total circum&s;tance, of my unhappy &s;tory; and to &s;hew you that I am not quite guilty, I have been obliged to let you into the &s;ecret, how far I am &s;o. Not guilty, perhaps, according to the laws of man, but too &s;urely criminal, to the full, again&s;t tho&s;e of God!</P>

<P>HE then told me, that the coroner's inque&s;t had brought in a verdict, of accidental death, the evening before, as no marks of vio|lence, appeared upon either of the bodies, but what had been occa&s;ioned by the fall. Thus you &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid he, upon what ground I &s;tand, with regard to any pro&s;ecution about this affair; &s;o that nothing but the confidence which your generous deportment, with the kind hint you have dropped of extricating me out of this dif|ficult bu&s;ine&s;s, have tempted me to place in you, need have induced me to let you into the &s;ecret of my being, in any manner acce&s;&s;ory, to this <HI>murder,</HI> which in all my future prayers and pe|nitence, I &s;hall ever con&s;ider, and endeavour to atone for, as one, in all its mo&s;t horrid and cul|pable forms. Amen!</P>
<P>He then claimed my promi&s;e, about <HI>qua&s;hing the indictment:</HI> I told him how I had rea&s;oned, and how far prevailed with the lady, the even|ing before. That, upon what I had heard, from both parties, I could judge that there was now no po&s;&s;ibility of their ever living together, again, and that I thought he would make a prudent
<PB N="99" REF="98">
bargain, in giving her a <HI>bill of divorce,</HI> with two hundred pounds a year, to get quietly rid of this trouble&s;ome and unhappy affair. He embraced me and the propo&s;al, together.</P>
<P>I went down &s;tairs to acquaint my fair client with this negotiation, and &s;he willingly accepted of the terms, on condition that I &s;hould be her <HI>tru&s;tee.</HI> I mentioned this article to the husband, who very readily con&s;ented to it. I &s;ee plainly, &s;aid he, her further &s;cheme in this: You are an hand&s;ome young fellow, and &s;he has no de&s;ign, I dare &s;ay, of retiring into a nunnery. She would keep up an intercour&s;e with you. Be it &s;o. She has now <HI>the world before her, where to chu&s;e,</HI> and though it is &s;ome con&s;olation to my humanity, at the &s;ame time, I think &s;he has better fortune than &s;he de&s;erves, to fall into the hands and protection of a gentleman of worth and honour, he was plea&s;ed to add, as you, Sir, appear to be.</P>
<P>Immediately upon this, I &s;ent off an expre&s;s to the next town, for an attorney, who came, and while the gentleman and I were at break|fa&s;t, drew up the article for a &s;eparate mainte|nance; we then went into the room, to the lady, for their mutual &s;igning and &s;ealing; which when over, he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, made a low bow to her, without &s;aying a word, but
<PB N="100" REF="99">
threw a bill of fifty pounds into her lap, and let fall &s;ome tears. Then turning toward me, thanked, embraced me, and retired.</P>
<P>This moving &s;cene affected me, extremely. It was near half an hour before I could get the better of it. Had I been twenty years older, I I might po&s;&s;ibly not have got rid of it, &s;o &s;oon. She appeared a good deal di&s;compo&s;ed, al&s;o. She wiped away a few tears, cried, <Q>Dear Sir, am I not extremely to be pitied? But 'tis pa&s;t, 'tis over now; and 'tis a je&s;t to think of re&s;i&s;ting de&s;tiny.</Q> This is a fine &s;alvo that &s;ome folks have got&mdash;They &s;in away, without remor&s;e, and impute their crimes, to fate.</P>
<Q>"The &s;tars are more in fault than they."</Q>

<P>I Then went up &s;tairs to &s;ee how my fair pri&s;oner had re&s;ted, and found her ju&s;t done breakfa&s;t. She a&s;ked me where I had been truanting, for the hour pa&s;t, and I replied, that there had happened a &s;mall law-&s;uit in the neigh|bourhood, that I had been appointed umpire,
<PB N="101" REF="100">
on both &s;ides, and had &s;ettled the di&s;pute to the intire &s;atisfaction of the parties. Ay, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, you can be good, if you plea&s;e. I &s;taid with her, reading and talking to her, by turns, till her chicken came upon the table, and then retired to my own meal, as u&s;ual, for the flavour of beef or mutton were yet too &s;trong for her.</P>
<P>I went down &s;tairs, paid a vi&s;it to my new ward, and joined my dinner to hers. Our behaviour toward each other, was a good deal con&s;trained. She thought, perhaps, that a free carriage might have given me too &s;light an opinion of her character; and I imagined, that a cavalier air, on my part, would &s;eem too much like taking advantage of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. We drank a bottle of wine together, after din|ner, talked of indifferent matters, and I then took my leave, pretending &s;ome extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s called me away; for I had given a cau|tion to the family not to acquaint her with my particular engagements in the hou&s;e, and &s;he &s;eemed a &s;tranger to them her&s;elf. At parting, &s;he invited me to return to &s;upper, which I pro|mi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I drank tea and played picquet with my fir&s;t charge, till nine o'clock, and then retired. I felt my&s;elf unea&s;y, all the evening. I was di&s;&s;a|tisfied
<PB N="102" REF="101">
with the di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of my own conduct, and was alarmed at my entering too far into vice. I had virtue enough to condemn &s;uch cour&s;es, but not re&s;olution &s;ufficient to quit them.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, the fair refugee and I appeared a good deal more at our ea&s;e together. We en|tered into a very galant conver&s;e, made a je&s;t of prudes, and ridiculed par&s;ons; deemed matri|mony but mere form, and that the unlucky ex|pre&s;&s;ion, of man and wife becoming <HI>one fle&s;h,</HI> was apt, from the very idea of <HI>homogeneity,</HI> to make them con&s;ider each other, too much as the legs or arms, of the &s;ame body, affording little more enjoyment in the conjugal embrace, than if they were only <HI>hugging them&s;elves.</HI> Ob&s;erved, that David was a man after God's own heart, without troubling our&s;elves to fix the aera when he became &s;o. Preferred the <HI>Canticles,</HI> in the literal &s;en&s;e, to all the re&s;t of the Bible; and agreed, that Epicurus was the be&s;t, of all moral philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>We drank two bottles together during this entertainment; toward the clo&s;e of which, &s;he began to grow full of &s;orrow, and lamented her misfortunes&mdash;I became full of compa&s;&s;ion, and comforted her. She &s;eemed perfectly plea&s;ed with my company, and wi&s;hed frequently, as
<PB N="103" REF="102">
&s;he was &s;o kind to expre&s;s her&s;elf, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of my &s;ex, &s;en&s;e, and &s;pirit. They are all at your &s;ervice, Madam, &s;aid I&mdash;There is a nation in the world, who think that by killing an enemy, they &s;hall be endowed with all his fa|culties, and I would die to &s;erve you. No, no, replied &s;he, you are not my enemy, and I think I could &s;ooner kill my&s;elf, than injure you. The good-natured creature!</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid I, there is another way of compa&s;&s;ing your flattering wi&s;h. You have read the Ea&s;tern Tales, I pre&s;ume. There is a &s;tory among them, of a certain dervi&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the faculty of &s;hooting his &s;oul into any dead body he plea&s;ed, and re-animating it again, while his own lay a breathle&s;s coar&s;e be&s;ide it. This fable, believe me, Madam, is verified among us adepts, at Oxford, now-a-days; and I my&s;elf have been thoroughly initiated into the my&s;tery of tran&s;migration. Take an example now, &s;aid I, go &s;tretch your&s;elf, at full length, upon that couch there, in the very po&s;ture of a dead per&s;on, and counterfeit a trance. I will then in&s;tantly let fly my &s;oul into you, upon the wings of love, and revive you again, to the wonderful delight of all &s;pectators; while my inanimate body &s;hall then lie panting by your &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103">It was now the &s;ea&s;on which midwives di&s;tin|gui&s;h by the title of <HI>gander-month.

<P>WHEN I found that my fair academie was perfectly recovered, I began to re|new my galantries toward her again. One night, after we had &s;upped and parted, as u&s;ual, I re|turned back from my apartment, with my night|cap in my pocket, and went into her bed-chamber. I found her on her knees, and earne&s;t at prayer, I was confounded, and retired into
<PB N="107" REF="106">
the ante-chamber; where I &s;tood mu&s;ing, till I heard her begin to move; but before I could gain the door, &s;he had &s;hot the bolt on the in&s;ide, and walked away to the farther end of the room. I became &s;en&s;ible of a certain inward rebuke, upon this occa&s;ion, and immediately returned up &s;tairs, to my own chamber.</P>
<P>The next morning, we met at breakfa&s;t; du|ring which we appeared under a mutual con|&s;traint and aukwardne&s;s, toward each other. After the tea-table was removed, I attempted to open the conver&s;ation, upon the la&s;t night's inci|dent, but faltered in the fir&s;t &s;entence; upon which &s;he interrupted me thus&mdash;<Q>Never, never, Mr. Carewe, mu&s;t we meet again, on any other terms but tho&s;e of friend&s;hip. A wo|man may be betrayed into error, by another's crime, but it mu&s;t be her own vice that &s;uf|fers her to continue in it. I have had, by this time, &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for reflection, and have pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere ones, on my former con|duct. But I rejoice in the &s;mart, which heals whil&s;t it corrodes. Good God! cried &s;he out, in a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, was it not enough, that I &s;hould &s;ink, at once, from man to wo|man, but that I mu&s;t again fall, even below the only character e&s;timable in her, too!</Q></P>
<P>She was going on, but I interrupted her by
<PB N="108" REF="107">
catching her in my arms, in a &s;udden tran&s;port of genero&s;ity, and fondne&s;s, and offering to marry her, that very in&s;tant. "No," &s;he replied, and wre&s;ting her&s;elf from my embrace, <Q>you have once denied me that happine&s;s, already&mdash;'Tis enough&mdash;I will not accept it now: For I &s;hall never receive from your honour, what I can|not owe to your love. Had you ever loved, before, I might perhaps, be led to accept of the pre&s;ent cool terms you offer. That dan|gerous cri&s;is once over, I might po&s;&s;ibly, be induced to compound for your friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; but while I have that hazardous aera to dread, I mu&s;t always keep a re&s;erve over my own affections toward you, which would be incon&s;i&s;tent with that union, which your genero&s;ity alone has challenged you now to proffer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This reflection will be explained in chapter cxxxix.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ever &s;ince that fatal day&mdash;or rather happy one, as I may now deem it," continued &s;he, when you revealed to me the unfortunate &s;ituation I was in, my thoughts have con|&s;tantly turned inward on my&s;elf. The &s;pring of that religious and virtuous education, with which my dear mother had imbued my mind, reverberated then &s;o &s;trongly on my
<PB N="109" REF="108">
heart, that it quickly awakened every pious &s;en&s;e, which avocation, idlene&s;s, and plea|&s;ure, had till then, lulled to &s;leep.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I meditated on the dependency of our earthly &s;tate, on the relation, duty, and obe|dience, we owe to our Creator; I weighed well the worth of all worldly enjoyments, and upon comparing time with eternity, have fixed my &s;oul &s;o firmly, upon higher concerns, that my mind has at length, happily arrived to this ju&s;t reflection, that nothing here below, but innocence, peace and ea&s;e, are worth my care.</P>
<P>I will to-morrow," continued &s;he, "re-a&s;&s;ume my former di&s;gui&s;e, and &s;till carry on the ma&s;querade, both on account of my dear mo|ther's commands, and for one of the rea&s;ons &s;he gave too; namely, that it will &s;ave me from the irk&s;omene&s;s and danger of any far|ther &s;ollicitation, or attempt; which by that means, I &s;hould have e&s;caped from you, al&s;o, if &s;o unfore&s;een and unprovided an accident, had not unfortunately, thrown me too much into your power.</P></Q>
<P>She &s;poke all this, with a collected &s;pirit, and &s;toici&s;m, which a&s;toni&s;hed, and charmed me. It rai&s;ed my e&s;teem for her, to the highe&s;t pitch, but at the &s;ame time, affected me with &s;uch a

tenderne&s;s and contrition, that I could not po&s;|&s;ibly refrain from tears; which &s;he perceiving, called out to me in a manly tone, and with a &s;mile at the &s;ame time, What, Mr. Carewe, &s;aid &s;he, are you going to change your &s;ex, al&s;o? <Q>For &s;hame, added &s;he, &s;hake off this wo|mani&s;h weakne&s;s&mdash;Arou&s;e, and be a man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were the very words he made u&s;e of to her, when he was &s;piriting her up to the duel.

<P>This whole day we &s;pent together, in a gene|ral conver&s;e, through which I behaved my&s;elf with the highe&s;t politene&s;s and decorum; both in my deportment toward her, and in avoiding the mo&s;t oblique hint, which might revive in her mind the remembrance of our former con|nection. This charming woman &s;eemed much flattered with the re&s;pect and delicacy of my manners; &s;he declared that &s;he &s;incerely e&s;teemed this day to be the happie&s;t, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant, we had ever &s;pent together, and I endeavoured to think &s;o.</P>
<P>The next morning, &s;he hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e to carry her to her grandfather's, where &s;he told me &s;he de&s;igned to &s;tay during the remainder of the vacation, and then return to the univer&s;ity, to

fini&s;h her &s;tudies.

<P>I remained for &s;ome time, at the gate, looking after the carriage while it continued in view, and contemplating upon this virtuous and ex|traordinary woman; I then returned into the hou&s;e, di&s;charged my bills, embraced my <HI>Hermes,</HI> took po&s;t-hor&s;es, and rode back to college, not &s;o plea&s;antly indeed, but much more com|po&s;ed in mind, however, than when I left it.</P>

<P>I Pa&s;&s;ed a very unea&s;y time of it, there, for a week. I felt an aukward want of half my|&s;elf, and if not the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, at lea&s;t the plea&s;ante&s;t part of me. I was dull in company, and melancholic, when alone. I began to &s;u&s;|pect I loved her; but this I was &s;ure of, that had &s;he given me time enough for it, I &s;hould certainly have done &s;o.</P>
<P>At one while, I was for carrying her off, and ravi&s;hing her into matrimony. Nor was this generous thought at all checked, by reflecting on her large fortune, for that article I was firmly re&s;olved to have made ea&s;y to my&s;elf: I &s;corned to accept the portion of fraud, and would have re&s;tored it to the rightful heir.</P>
<P>At another time, I had one curio&s;ity already gratified, and another &s;till to &s;atisfy; namely, to try how long a &s;pliced cha&s;tity could hold out, and whether this experiment might not be like <HI>new wine put into old bottles,</HI> or <HI>a new piece into an old garment.</HI> At length, time and u&s;e, which generally blend all our wants and lo&s;&s;es with the common complexion of life, re&s;tored my carele&s;ne&s;s and &s;pirits to me again.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="112">On the commencement of our term, my dear <HI>Levis Agyeu</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the names of Apollo, from his having no beard.</NOTE> returned to college. As &s;oon as I heard of her arrival, I went to wait on her at her apartments&mdash;She received me with great civility and affection, but immediately putting on her hat, &s;aid it was a fine morning, and de&s;ired the plea&s;ure of my company to take a walk with her in the park, as &s;he wanted a little private conver&s;ation with me, which might be inter|rupted by other vi&s;itants. I approved of, but was di&s;&s;atisfied at, this caution of hers.</P>
<P>When we were alone in the park, &s;he told me that the old colonel &s;eemed extremely rejoiced at her vi&s;it, but much concerned at &s;eeing her look &s;o pale and thin. You have &s;tudied your eyes out, my child, &s;aid he, and 'tis high time to be done with that &s;ame work, now. You have been chewing upon three years of crabbed learning already, at that &s;ame univer&s;ity, as 'tis called, be&s;ides all you &s;wallowed before, at &s;chool, and if you are not as wi&s;e as Solomon, by this time, the devil's in it for me. But there's an end of all farther puzzling now, as I have lately procured a cornetcy for you, from my old friend the &s;ecretary of war; and I long &s;adly, to &s;ee you &s;trut the parade, in your mili|tary uniform, &s;hortly.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="113">You know, &s;aid &s;he to me, that I am no Amazon, and yet this declaration of his did not di&s;tre&s;s me &s;o much as you might naturally ex|pect&mdash;I was prepared for it, from his frequent re&s;olutions, in that way, and had therefore, furni&s;hed my&s;elf with an an&s;wer. I returned him thanks for this, and all his other kind intentions in my favour, but added, that with regard to the profe&s;&s;ions of life, it was always both pru|dent, and rea&s;onable, to grant the party en|gaging, &s;ome liberty of choice, in a matter of &s;o much moment, both to them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>Zounds, &s;aid he, thou isn't afraid, is thee? No, Sir, I replied, with an a&s;&s;ured countenance, I thank God, that I fear nothing now, but him|&s;elf and you. But it is my duty to the fir&s;t of the&s;e mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, continued I, which makes me he&s;itate about too implicit an obe|dience, to your commands. Very fine, very fine! replied the colonel, all this begins very finely indeed, but tell me quickly, now, with|out any more of your logic, or &s;ophi&s;try, what the devil is all this about?</P>

<P>I Thus went on. When I entered upon the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy, Sir, at the univer&s;ity, I was charmed and &s;urpri&s;ed at the internal art and contrivance of the al|mighty artificer, in many &s;ubjects, which I had looked upon &s;uperficially, before. Still as I proceeded, &s;till as my knowledge improved, in mathematics, gravitation, attraction, and a&s;tronomy, my mind enlarged, and my &s;oul was impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of awe and wonder, at the amazing greatne&s;s, goodne&s;s, and oeconomy of Providence. Nor needs all this to refute the fool of David<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, there is no God.</NOTE>&mdash;Shew him but a &s;traw, and when he has accounted for that, let him then di&s;pute a Deity.</P>
<P>Afterwards, Sir, when I had entered into my cour&s;e of moral philo&s;ophy, I quick perceived the duties, the relations, the dependencies, both of civil and religious obligations. I almo&s;t thought the &s;y&s;tem perfect; but there &s;eemed &s;till to be &s;omething yet wanting. I loved vir|tue, but feared not vice. I adored the Deity,
<PB N="116" REF="115">
but feared impiety, in prayer. I a&s;ked for ble&s;|&s;ings, and yet dreaded them as cur&s;es. There needed two things, yet, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the &s;cheme. Certain &s;anctions for our virtue, and a revelation, to in&s;truct our wor|&s;hip.</P>
<P>The&s;e great <HI>de&s;iderata</HI> then, directed my inqui|ries toward religion. I here found all was per|fect harmony. The &s;cene extended, my views enlarged, the concordance, between divine and human things, apparent; virtue encouraged, and vice deterred. And to &s;um up all, a form of wor&s;hip appointed, which aboli&s;hed idolatry, in&s;tructed prayer, and re&s;trained enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>What the devil, is all this for, interrupted the old &s;oldier? Was this harangue nece&s;&s;ary, &s;aid he, to let us know you were a Chri&s;tian? I always honoured religion, as much as you, or any &s;cholar of Oxford, or Cambridge, either; ay, by G&mdash;, as much as the chaplain of our regi|ment, him&s;elf, who, by the Lord, was as ho|ne&s;t, and jolly a fellow, as any of the corps. But a man may &s;erve God, and his king, and country, too, at the &s;ame time, I hope. Grant me but that, and there's an end of the argu|ment.</P>
<P>You are certainly in the right of it, Sir, replied I, and your ob&s;ervation is indeed, very ju&s;t.
<PB N="117" REF="116">
But then, Sir, in return, I hope that you will allow me there may be more ways than one, of doing all three. How in the name of God, now, is that po&s;&s;ible, an&s;wered he? can we pre|&s;erve the prote&s;tant religion, Hanover, or Old England, any other way, but by fighting?</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;aid I, I am far from di&s;puting the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting, for as the world is at pre|&s;ent con&s;tituted, there mu&s;t be &s;oldiers, as well as other <HI>handicraftmen.</HI> But pray, Sir, is not a divine, in&s;tructing his congregation, or reform|ing his pari&s;h, more &s;erviceable to God, the king, and his country, than a colonel of hor&s;e, or foot, exerci&s;ing his regiment on the parade?</P>
<P>Is not the making of good &s;ubjects, more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, than the training of &s;oldiers? One may be hired, the other not&mdash;What &s;o fitted to make men brave, as religion? And what to regulate the di&s;cipline of an army, as morals? The di|vine, then, is nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance&mdash; The &s;oldier, only in the &s;econd. The &s;oldier's profe&s;&s;ion, is but temporal and temporary. The divine's, cele&s;tial and eternal!</P>
<P>Preach me no preachments, interrupted old Mars; a par&s;on, indeed, were he &s;uch as I am afraid few par&s;ons are, might perhaps, do &s;ome &s;ervice to religion, and his country, in the way you &s;uppo&s;e; but never tell me, man, that all
<PB N="118" REF="117">
the preaching in the world, can ever be able to defend Hanover. No, no, Bilbo is the word, there, and right or wrong, nolus, volus, we mu&s;t all fight for Hanover, that's a &s;ure thing.</P>
<P>I replied, there was no fear but there would be always people enough found to fight for Hanover, or a ca&s;tle in the air, if they were paid for it; but as all men were not to be &s;oldiers, we might be left at liberty to chu&s;e our profe&s;|&s;ions; and that, for my own part, I had for &s;ome time, been &s;en&s;ible of &s;o &s;trong a propen|&s;ity toward putting on the gown, that I took it to be an inward <HI>call</HI> from the &s;pirit, to enter into holy orders.</P>
<P>Call me no calls, replied old Te&s;ty, you are a coward, &s;irrah, I &s;ee you are. You are no man, but an hodmandod<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;hell-&s;nail.</NOTE>, and would rather fight the devil, than a Frenchman. Call of the &s;pirit! No, &s;neaker, 'tis want of &s;pirit that is your call, and like a criminal, flying for his life, you would take &s;anctuary in a church, would you? Yours is no <HI>call,</HI> I &s;ay, 'tis <HI>proffered &s;ervice,</HI> and you know the proverb, you &s;h&mdash;n a&mdash;e fellow you.</P>
<P>Call of the &s;pirit, for&s;ooth! but 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome people &s;hould pretend it, or how few
<PB N="119" REF="118">
of the pulpits, in England, would be filled, now-a-days! How many do I know, my&s;elf, who were never called by the &s;pirit, nor ever call upon it, either. But bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be done; and they marry and chri&s;ten, as well as the be&s;t; for a par&s;on's a par&s;on, and there's an end on't. What the devil need we de&s;ire more?</P>
<P>But here's another difficulty, continued he, you have brought upon me too, by your &s;trange notions of &s;pirit and pulpit, and &s;uch <HI>tringum-trangums</HI>&mdash;What will your <HI>quaking &s;pirit</HI> help me to do now, with the commi&s;&s;ion, that I have laid out all my intere&s;t to procure for you, and which I mu&s;t now return &s;o thankle&s;sly, upon my friend's hands again? By no means, Sir, &s;aid I, you may di&s;po&s;e of it more properly, than even by giving it to me&mdash;My cou&s;in Tom, Sir, will readily accept of it. It will be looked upon as a kind of pre&s;ent to him, and I would willingly obviate every occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y, which might po&s;&s;ibly, ari&s;e between us.</P>
<P>And &s;o, by G&mdash;d, I will, replied he, &s;harply, and if I &s;hould leave him my e&s;tate too, what would you &s;ay to that, youth! I &s;hould &s;ay no|thing, Sir, but &s;hould think, that as you have made the fortune by your own valour, you have certainly a right to be&s;tow it according to your own favour; and if, Sir, added I, your
<PB N="120" REF="119">
opinion or inclinations, &s;hould point him out, as the more worthy object, I &s;hall be perfectly re&s;igned, both to the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, and yours.</P>
<P>Pugh, pugh, &s;aid he, you won't let me have my own way, in any thing, I &s;ee&mdash;I am not u&s;ed to the&s;e old-fangled notions, and I don't know, for the blood of me, how to deal with them. I wi&s;h, with all my &s;oul, that either you, or I, were different &s;ort of people, that we might under&s;tand one another, rightly. But let us have done with it now, child, &s;aid he, and go bid them lay the cloth for &s;upper.</P>

<P>YOU may be &s;urpri&s;ed, perhaps, &s;aid &s;he, at the ea&s;ine&s;s with which I &s;eem to have re&s;igned a fortune in which might be compre|hended all the flattering pro&s;pects and enjoy|ments of life. But, Mr. Carewe, pur&s;ued &s;he, with a &s;igh, I had already &s;haken hands with this life. And though I think I have now hap|pily attained to &s;uch a pitch of firmne&s;s and fortitude of mind, that were it po&s;&s;ible to be
<PB N="121" REF="120">
either my duty, or obligation, to fight, I could this in&s;tant draw the &s;word, and like another <HI>Joan d' Arc,</HI> ru&s;h into the midmo&s;t battle. But to enter a volunteer in arms, would have been a pre&s;umption unbecoming my real character, and therefore I declined it.</P>
<P>And as to the worldly con&s;iderations, which might naturally have perplexed me, upon this occa&s;ion, continued &s;he, I had already wrought my mind to this determination about them. I do not think that female virtue con&s;i&s;ts in cha&s;tity alone, though certainly, both pru|dence and decency require this to be our di&s;tingui&s;hing character. This duty we owe, fir&s;t to religion, and next to our&s;elves; but ju&s;|tice is an higher point of virtue, becau&s;e we owe this, both to God, to our&s;elves, to our neigh|bour, and to the rights of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I had hitherto carried on the deceit, in obe|dience to my mother's commands&mdash;But ever &s;ince I began to con&s;ider things in an higher light, and to compare my fir&s;t and &s;econd duty, together, I had re&s;olved to act, in this matter, that equitable, and ingenuous part, which I am certain &s;he would her&s;elf direct, were &s;he now to return upon earth, to in&s;truct me.</P>
<P>What then had I to apprehend from my grandfather's re&s;entment, but that event which I
<PB N="122" REF="121">
had before re&s;olved upon in my own mind? The virtue of the act, was already perfect in re&s;olve, and the merit of the gift I was willing to re&s;ign to another. I could not imagine that my grandfather would have ca&s;t me off to ab&s;o|lute beggary; and any rea&s;onable provi&s;ion he might have made for me, would have &s;erved to &s;upport me in that &s;cheme of life which I had already re&s;olved upon: For I am determined, &s;aid &s;he, to put on the gown, for one additional rea&s;on more than my dear mother gave me for wearing a male habit; which is, that a re&s;pect to my profe&s;&s;ion, may re&s;train both that prophane, and immode&s;t manner of &s;peaking, before me, which I have already &s;u&s;tained too much of among men.</P>
<P>I was charmed, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, at the no|blene&s;s of &s;oul, in this virtuous woman, but was &s;omewhat mortified, however, to find that I was not capable my&s;elf, of the &s;ame refinement of &s;entiment, in one particular; for I confe&s;s that I felt di&s;appointed at her having prevented me from recommending to her the very action, &s;he had already re&s;olved upon; and from offering her three hundred pounds a year, out of my own fortune, in con&s;ideration of her re&s;igning the e&s;tate to her cou&s;in; which I a&s;&s;ure ye, gentle|men,
<PB N="123" REF="122">
&s;aid he, had for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been fully my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was going once to mention this to her, but thought it might have had a di&s;ingenuous air; and in &s;hort, &s;aid he, I was really, as much puzzled, as old Square Toes, him&s;elf, to know how to deal with her <HI>old-fangled</HI> notions, as he &s;tiled them, and almo&s;t wi&s;hed as he did, that either of us were different &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>However, this not &s;incerely, for I thought it too &s;oon for my&s;elf, to quit the pur&s;uit of plea|&s;ure, and indeed, for her too; as the &s;mall <HI>&s;nack</HI> &s;he had got of it, was hardly, in my opinion, worth &s;o much repentance; but as grace comes earlier to &s;ome people, than to others, I would not wi&s;h to di&s;turb her peace, or attempt to interrupt her cour&s;e of virtue, but for a moment, to gratify even my warme&s;t de|&s;ires; for I was re&s;olved, upon all occa&s;ions of this kind, to qualify, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;inner, with the &s;aint; and never to mix up a greater <HI>potion</HI> of vice with my plea&s;ure, than was ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary as a <HI>vehicle</HI> to it. By which means, I ever retained an <HI>hank in hand,</HI> as the jockeys phra&s;e it, to pull up, before I was got to the brink of the precipice.</P>

<P>WHILE I was revolving the&s;e things in my mind, the fair prolocutor thus went on. The next morning, &s;aid &s;he, after break|fa&s;t, the old gentleman called me into his apart|ment, and after &s;ome minutes &s;ilence, during which time he &s;at mu&s;ing and looking at the fire, he lifted up his head, and turning his face toward me, in a good-humoured tone of voice, Mr. Par&s;on, &s;aid he, I could not well &s;leep, la&s;t night, for the &s;ermon you preached to me, ye&s;terday evening.</P>
<P>It put me in mind of your poor mother, &s;he was a great rea&s;oner, and would &s;ometimes ar|gufy the ca&s;e with me, till &s;he u&s;ed to put me into a pa&s;&s;ion, for I always hated women's prate. But it does well enough in a man, e&s;pe|cially a &s;cholar, as you are; for what does peo|ple learn for, d'ye &s;ee me, if they don't &s;hew it? Therefore, I con&s;ent, d'ye mind, that you make your&s;elf a par&s;on, as &s;oon as you will, and though I mu&s;t &s;ay that you have di&s;appointed me hugely, in my fir&s;t de&s;ign for you, I don't doubt, in the lea&s;t, but you may be a good man yet, for all that; and we will now be as good
<PB N="125" REF="124">
friends as ever, &s;aid he, and &s;haking me by the hand at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I thanked him on my bended knee, but he ordered me to ri&s;e quickly, &s;aying, Never kneel, child, but to the king, God ble&s;s him, or your prayers&mdash;That is my notion, &s;on, and I don't doubt but I &s;hall &s;ee you chaplain to our regi|ment yet, and you &s;hall be &s;o, believe me, ad|ded he, if &s;trong drink can kill a par&s;on, and that I have any intere&s;t with <HI>&s;ome people,</HI> and I never &s;ay a thing that I don't mean to do; that's my way, d'ye mark me?</P>
<P>You'll live a roving, jolly life, of it, then, you dog you, and know more of the world, in one year, there, than you would do in &s;even, in this pari&s;h, or the next. But I have &s;ent for your cou&s;in Tommy, and will give him the com|mi&s;&s;ion <HI>you know.</HI> No&mdash;you &s;hall give it to him, your&s;elf, it &s;hall be your gift, it will make him love you, and I would have families live well together, child, after I am dead and rotten.</P>
<P>He then gave me the &s;ecretary of war's letter, which mentioned that he had procured a cor|netcy for him, at his reque&s;t, in the &mdash; regiment of cavalry, and de&s;ired him to write the per&s;on's name, at the bottom of that letter, and return it to him immediately, in order to have the commi&s;&s;ion filled up. I thanked him
<PB N="126" REF="125">
for the plea&s;ing office he had a&s;&s;igned me&mdash;For giving, is certainly one of the plea&s;ante&s;t things, in the world.</P>
<P>In the evening, my cou&s;in arrived, equipt perfectly <HI>&agrave; la militaire;</HI> for my aunt, in compli|ment to the martial enthu&s;ia&s;m of her father, had ever &s;ince he was put into breeches, affected to have him dre&s;&s;ed like an officer, with cock|ade, &s;word, and gambadoes. He is perfect ma&s;ter of his exerci&s;es, which, with a little &s;mattering of French, is the only part of educa|tion his parents had ever attended to. He has an hand&s;ome, genteel per&s;on, and has that kind of forwardne&s;s and air of confidence, which per&s;ons who know one thing, a little, and are quite ignorant of every thing el&s;e, are apt to a&s;|&s;ume. He had lately challenged a young apo|thecary, in the town where his father lived, for &s;aying, that it was ridiculous to &s;ee a chit pretend to &s;trut about, with a &s;word on, who was only of fit &s;ize, to wear a gly&s;ter-bag <HI>armed</HI> And the pi&s;tol and the pe&s;tle were going to it, <HI>ding dong,</HI> when &s;ome friends happened to interpo&s;e, and put an end to this martial &s;trife.</P>
<P>After the mutual &s;alutes were over, I took him a&s;ide into another parlour, and &s;hewed him the letter from the &s;ecretary of war. He con|gratulated me upon my good fortune, but &s;aid,
<PB N="127" REF="126">
with a &s;igh, that he would rather be in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of that commi&s;&s;ion, than of the old Don's e&s;tate, for that the army was the only profe&s;&s;ion for a gentleman, all the re&s;t of the world being divided into <HI>pay&s;ans,</HI> and <HI>bourgeois;</HI> and that he longed mo&s;t bloodily, to be at &s;la&s;hing work with the French.</P>
<P>Then cou&s;in, &s;aid I, you &s;eem to be a much fitter per&s;on for this bu&s;ine&s;s, than I am, for upon my word, I bear no manner of malice to any people breathing, not even to my foes. So &s;aying, I carele&s;sly took up a pen, which lay on the table, and writing down <HI>Thomas Irwin</HI> at the foot of the letter, pre&s;ented it to him.</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed it, hugged me, and drawing his &s;word, made &s;everal pa&s;&s;es at an old Wind&s;or chair, &s;wearing that there &s;hould not be a French|man in the world, by the end of the campaign; and that he would then gather all the women together into a &s;eraglio, and people the king|dom over again, him&s;elf, with good Pro|te&s;tants.</P>
<P>Come along, my gallant &s;oldier, &s;aid I, and pay your acknowledgments, where they are more properly due; for the gift is our grand|father's, though he was &s;o kind as to appoint me the giver. We then went up &s;tairs to the old gentleman's room, where the bri&s;k cornet

returned him ha&s;ty thanks for his preferment, and in&s;tantly begged leave to &s;et out, that even|ing, for London, to deliver the letter, and ex|pedite the commi&s;&s;ion. The good old man cried, There's a lad for you that is in ha&s;te to fight, then gave him his ble&s;&s;ing, with a bill of an hundred pounds, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>

<P>HERE we were interrupted, by the coming up of three or four of our college ac|quaintance, with whom we walked a few turns, till the bell &s;truck three o'clock. I then pre&s;&s;ed her to come home, and dine with me, which &s;he refu&s;ed; upon which I offered to go home with her, that &s;he might be at liberty to fini&s;h the re&s;t of her &s;tory, if any yet remained, but &s;he re|plied, that &s;he had nothing prepared at her chambers, and propo&s;ed to the re&s;t of the com|pany, that we &s;hould all go to the tavern toge|ther, which was agreed upon.</P>
<P>After dinner, we entered into a lively conver|&s;ation, in which &s;he bore her part with great wit and &s;pirit, and &s;eemed to be more chearful and
<PB N="129" REF="128">
di&s;ingaged in her manner, than I had known her for many months pa&s;t. This &s;truck me as a confirmation of her virtue. The conflict &s;eemed to be over. My heart exulted with joy.</P>
<P>We drank our friends, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e, and then one of the company, who had been appointed <HI>magi&s;ter bibendi,</HI> propo&s;ed a round of &s;entiments, and began him&s;elf decently enough, with <HI>the joys of friend&s;hip, love, and wine.</HI> The next turn fell to me, and I gave <HI>the &s;ea&s;on of May, and the age of fifteen.</HI> But this &s;ort of cha&s;te archne&s;s, did not long continue, for the next per&s;on called upon, launched out beyond all innu|endo, which began to give my delicate friend &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. She ca&s;t a look of di&s;tre&s;s, to|ward me, and I immediately put a &s;top to the round, by acquainting the company that our friend there, had lately taken the re&s;olution of going into orders, and that &s;uch ribaldry mu&s;t certainly be offen&s;ive to him. She bowed, and the re&s;t were &s;ilent,</P>
<P>I then propo&s;ed, as we were all &s;cholars, that we &s;hould toa&s;t &s;ome cla&s;&s;ical rounds, of me|mories, beginning with the philo&s;ophers, while we were &s;ober, and re&s;erving the poets for our more jovial cups. The fancy took, becau&s;e the thought was new, and each per&s;on declared his &s;ect, by his toa&s;t. Plato led the way, becau&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="129">
he wore good cloaths, and kept a good table. Democritus came next, becau&s;e he was a merry fellow, and taught, long before Copernicus, that the world turned round. Then followed Zeno, not on account of the &s;everity of his philo&s;ophy, but becau&s;e he had done ju&s;tice on him&s;elf for it, by an halter.</P>
<P>When it came to my turn, I named Ari&s;tip|pus, on account of the character that Horace gives of him, <HI>Omnis Ari&s;tippum decuit, color, &amp; &s;tatus, &amp; res.</HI> Then my fair philo&s;opher con|cluded the round with Socrates, as being, in the opinion of Era&s;mus, a Chri&s;tian, before Chri&s;tianity; and then immediately, ro&s;e up, and quitted the company. I offered to attend her home, but &s;he forbad it; &s;aying, that &s;he had her lectures to look over before examina|tions; and appointed me to meet her, the next morning, in the park, as before, to conclude her &s;tory. I returned to my company, and fini&s;hed the evening, <HI>a la mode.</HI></P>

<P>THE next day, I met my charming friend, &s;aid he, at the time and place appointed, and after a quarter of an hour's conver&s;ation upon general topics, &s;he proceeded with the thread of her narration. Thus far, &s;aid &s;he, had I tolerably well extricated my&s;elf, from a very difficult piece of bu&s;ine&s;s; but my principal point had not been yet obtained. There was a matter of much higher con&s;equence, &s;till to be di&s;po&s;ed of, which I confe&s;s I was &s;o impatient to have adju&s;ted, that I was, one or twice, very near declaring the whole &s;ecret of my di&s;gui&s;e, to my grandfather, had not a tenderne&s;s for my mother's character, prevented me.</P>
<P>I then determined with my&s;elf to keep the matter &s;till a &s;ecret, thinking that no accident could di&s;appoint the hone&s;t purpo&s;e I had already framed; for &s;hould I happen to die before my grandfather, the e&s;tate would devolve of cour&s;e, into the right line; and &s;hould I outlive him, I might then re&s;ign it, with equal advantage to my cou&s;in, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome &s;cruples aro&s;e, that ju&s;tice delayed, was in &s;ome &s;ort, ju&s;tice denied, and that it was always prudent to be hone&s;t, while
<PB N="132" REF="131">
one may, le&s;t the general frailty of human na|ture, might perhaps, ob&s;truct the fair intent, when the time may call upon us to perfect it by action. Be&s;ides, &s;aid &s;he, the matter lay a dead weight upon my mind, and I was impatient to get rid of it, in order to dedicate my whole &s;oul, to the contemplation and enjoyment of philo|&s;ophy, and religion.</P>
<P>Upon this re&s;olve, I went up directly, into my grandfather's chamber, who was much con|fined by the gout; I took occa&s;ion to commend the &s;pirit and accompli&s;hments of my cou&s;in, in which he &s;eemed heartily to join me with a certain martial joy in his countenance, at the &s;ame time. I added, that I imagined he mu&s;t have been ju&s;t &s;uch a bri&s;k young fellow, him|&s;elf, at his years, all fire and activity. The very counterpart, exactly, replied he, with a &s;mile of &s;atisfaction. I am extremely &s;orry then, Sir, &s;aid I, that you have not &s;uch an heir, to repre&s;ent you; who might &s;erve to perpetuate your fame, and keep your character alive, after you are gone, better than I can po&s;&s;ibly do, in my confined &s;cheme of life, who am likely to hide both, under a gown, and bury their me|mory, in &s;ome country cure.</P>
<P>What do'&s;t mean, boy, replied he, with a good deal of &s;urpri&s;e? Han't I told you already,
<PB N="133" REF="132">
that we are as good friends now, as ever? Pri|thee, what &s;ort of a crotchet ha&s;t got in thy noddle, at pre&s;ent, lad? Pray explain it quickly, now, without more ifs or ands. To which I replied, that I was then come to ju&s;tify my cha|racter to him, by giving a convincing proof of the &s;incerity with which I had made my option of the gown, in preference to the &s;word, by begging leave to renounce all future preten&s;ions to his favour, with regard to the e&s;tate. That as I did really mean to &s;eque&s;ter my&s;elf in|tirely, from the world, firmly re&s;olving never to marry, &s;o great a fortune might be either a temp|tation, or an incumbrance to me. For that for|tune, titles, rank, and grandeur, are dangerous &s;ophi&s;ters, and too often per&s;uade us that the fal&s;e goods of life, are the true ones. That his other grand&s;on was more likely to wear it with honour, and being capable of bu&s;tling in camps, and &s;hining in courts, and &s;enates, was a fitter per&s;on to put foremo&s;t in the world, at the head of a family which his own virtue and bravery had &s;o lately brought into re&s;pect and notice. That for my part, I &s;hould perfectly acquie&s;ce, in whatever portion his kindne&s;s might think proper to allot me, which though ever &s;o &s;mall, &s;aid I, if I have virtue, will be as much
<PB N="134" REF="133">
as I &s;hall want, and if not, will be more than I &s;hall de&s;erve.</P>
<P>The good old man, continued &s;he, at the&s;e words, bur&s;t into tears, &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, in an hurrying manner, Boy, boy, you were born to be my plague, and are &s;till cro&s;&s;ing me, in every &s;cheme I have. But perceiving that my tears fell fa&s;ter than his own, he cried, Prithee be quiet, child, and don't di&s;tre&s;s me any far|ther&mdash;Don't be angry, I don't mean what I &s;ay, to vex you, all I meant, was&mdash;But indeed, I don't know what to mean, or &s;ay, you have made &s;uch a fool of me. We continued both &s;ilent, for &s;everal minutes, before we could ei|ther of us compo&s;e our&s;elves &s;ufficiently, to &s;peak any farther, upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We then entered into &s;everal expo&s;tulations, on both &s;ides, but upon finding me determined in my purpo&s;e, he at length, acquie&s;ced in my propo&s;al, and a&s;ked me upon what provi&s;ion I had formed my oeconomy. Speak, &s;aid he, and be it what it will, you &s;hall have it, by G&mdash;. I declined this offer, &s;aying, that it would not be becoming in me, to parcel out his bounty, nor to &s;tipulate conditions, as if I was &s;elling the e&s;tate, only thus far I might pretend to pre&s;cribe, that I &s;hould prefer a &s;um of money to an an|nuity,
<PB N="135" REF="134">
in order to have &s;omething in my power, to leave, to friend&s;hip, or to charity.</P>
<P>Well then, my dear child, &s;aid he, I gave your &s;i&s;ter three thou&s;and pounds, d'ye mind, and I will give you four, if that will content you. But, hearky me, cried the worthy &s;oldier, at the &s;ame time, don't be mealy-mouthed about the matter, in the lea&s;t, for you &s;hall have what you plea&s;e, as I told you before. I &s;aid 'twas ample, bowed, and thanked him.</P>
<P>The next morning, continued &s;he, he &s;ent for me into his chamber, and &s;hewed me the draught of the pre&s;ent will he de&s;igned to per|fect, by which he had made the provi&s;ion of four thou&s;and pounds, in my favour, and &s;ettled his e&s;tate on my cou&s;in, but with a remainder over, to me, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not leave any heirs male behind him&mdash;For you de&s;erve it, &s;aid he, if I had ten e&s;tates, by the Lord, you de&s;erve them all.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed a proper &s;en&s;e of gratitude, upon this occa&s;ion, &s;taid with him till he could hobble about the hou&s;e, received his ble&s;&s;ing, and came off hither, to fini&s;h my &s;tudies, &s;aid &s;he, and to take upon me the profe&s;&s;ion of holy orders, which I have already declared to you.</P>

<P>DUring the cour&s;e of her &s;tory, I was af|fected, and amazed. I dropped tears, at &s;ome parts of it, and would have prai&s;ed her, in others, but that there appeared a noblene&s;s, and a &s;pirit, in her virtue, which &s;eemed above it, and awed me into &s;ilence. I found my&s;elf in a &s;ituation, too difficult to be de&s;cribed. Your own &s;entiment and delicacy, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, mu&s;t repre&s;ent it to you. I could not ad|mire, without lamenting, nor commend her, without condemning my&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, there was one part of her di&s;cour&s;e, which had dwelt upon my mind ever &s;ince the fir&s;t propo&s;ition of it, and which I then laid hold of, to extricate my &s;peech. I was di&s;|plea&s;ed at her purpo&s;e of going into orders. She was perfect enough, intrin&s;ically, and needed not the cloak of &s;anctity: and cleric pride, joined to female vanity, methought would be enough to demoli&s;h the pure&s;t &s;aint, that ever was canonized. I therefore, took occa&s;ion, from this &s;ubject, to open my mouth, and gave her the following opinion upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="136">I told her, that there was &s;omething very un|orthodox, in her &s;cheme. Women are ordered <HI>to keep &s;ilence, in the churches,</HI> &s;o that the bu&s;ine&s;s of catechi&s;ing, preaching, or exhorting, can never become any part of their province. That were there even no offence, in the thing it&s;elf, yet the di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of the act, was unwor|thy of her. That the carrying on a deceit, at the foot of the altar, even with the be&s;t intent, was dangerous hypocri&s;y. Nor was &s;uch a <HI>pious fraud</HI> at all nece&s;&s;ary to her purpo&s;e, as we may dedicate our &s;ervices to Heaven, under any character, or in any profe&s;&s;ion. And that the world is, at pre&s;ent, &s;o con&s;tituted, that the pre|cept, or example, of one virtuous layman, would have more effect, than the preaching of ten par&s;ons.</P>
<P>I added, that &s;hould &s;he even be able to pre|&s;erve the &s;ecret, during her life, her death at la&s;t, mo&s;t certainly would reveal it. That the &s;tory of pope Joan, was a di&s;grace even to that reli|gion, that was before a di&s;grace to it&s;elf; and that this di&s;covery might &s;upply &s;mall wits and libertines, with matter of &s;coff, would bring a reflection upon her memory, and occa&s;ion her body to be the object of public view. <HI>I will &s;et thee as a gazing-&s;tock. I will &s;hew the nations thy nakedne&s;s, and the kingdoms thy &s;hame.</HI> Nahum.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="137">She a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he had never con&s;idered the matter in any of the&s;e lights, before. That knowing of no <HI>&s;alique law,</HI> in &s;cripture, to ex|clude women from the mini&s;try<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor in France, to exclude them from the throne, nei|ther, though it was con&s;trued and &s;trained to that &s;en&s;e by Philip de Valois, in order to exclude Edward the IIId, of England, from the crown.</NOTE>, &s;he had pre|&s;umed that nothing but <HI>negative</HI> cu&s;tom merely, which e&s;tabli&s;hes no law, &s;tood again&s;t it. But that what I had ju&s;t hinted to her, had &s;truck her in &s;uch a way, as to make her &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he had u&s;ed &s;omewhat of that kind of ingenious &s;ophi&s;try with her&s;elf, which &s;he had already condemned, in her dear mother. But that at pre&s;ent, &s;he found both her &s;cruples and deli|cacy &s;ufficiently alarmed, to re&s;olve on laying a&s;ide her purpo&s;e. She then thanked me for my advice, and concluded her &s;peech by &s;aying, that &s;he was plea&s;ed <HI>to owe me any thing.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;natched her hand, with eagerne&s;s, crying out, <Q>My charming &s;aint, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould ever be indebted to him who&s;e life and fortunes you have already, &s;o fully purcha&s;ed. The pittance you have com|pounded for, with your grandfather, is too &s;canty a provi&s;ion for you, for life&mdash;Take half my e&s;tate, in addition&mdash;I here mo&s;t</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="139" REF="138">
Hold, Mr. Carewe, interrupted &s;he&mdash;Keep your fortune, but amend your life. This would be true genero&s;ity to me, indeed; and this the only pre&s;ent, be a&s;&s;ured, I &s;hall ever accept of, from your hands.</P>
<P>However, &s;aid &s;he, &s;eeing me affected, and confounded, let us &s;till continue friends, for life. I find a perfect di&s;po&s;ition, in my&s;elf, to|ward this cha&s;te connection, and I &s;hould hope that your heart, however libertine it may be, is not totally devoid of all Platonics, neither. Some company appeared in &s;ight, and came &s;trolling up to us ju&s;t as &s;he had fini&s;hed this expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;he retired home, immediately afterwards.</P>
<P>Yes, my cherub, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, and gazing after her, my friend&s;hip, my admiration, my e&s;teem, can never po&s;&s;ibly be rai&s;ed higher, to|ward any mortal object. Then why, O nature! ha&s;t thou &s;uffered love to be a pa&s;&s;ion di&s;tinct from the&s;e! I would this moment, &s;acrifice my life for thy &s;ervice, and yield my fortune in exchange for love.

<P>THIS reflection of Mr. Carewe, is both na|tural and mortifying, at the &s;ame time. How mu&s;t it hurt one's moral, not to be able to rai&s;e, or direct our pa&s;&s;ion, toward an object, whom rea&s;on, honour, virtue, and obligation, even with the addition of youth and beauty, may point out to us, as in this, and frequent other in&s;tances, has been the ca&s;e?</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, how mu&s;t it pique our pride, to be reduced to wear the chains of &s;ome idiot, of an harlot, or, what is infinitely wor&s;e, a &s;hrew, even with beauty and youth, but often, without either? of which I could quote you many examples.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, who, though a man of both &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, had laboured for &s;ome years under this predicament, after many fruit|le&s;s &s;truggles to &s;et him&s;elf free, compared him|&s;elf, aptly enough, to a lion in heraldry, held fa&s;t by the lower parts, and pawing to get loo&s;e.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinct from that charming, and rational union of hearts and minds, which is the gene|ral &s;ympathy of the mo&s;t perfect natures, there ari&s;es &s;ometimes, a certain extraordinary and
<PB N="141" REF="140">
unaccountable fever in the blood, more a phrenzy, than a pa&s;&s;ion, and rather an in&s;tinct, than a &s;entiment, which it is &s;aid people are, at one time or another of their lives, <HI>afflicted</HI> with.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people are born with the &s;eeds of this pa&s;&s;ion, as well as of the &s;mall-pox, in their con&s;titution, which &s;ooner or later, break out, as the blood, or humours of the body, happen to be apt, or fit, to nouri&s;h the di&s;temper. The&s;e two unavoidable incidents are &s;o much alike, in &s;everal particulars, that I &s;hall carry on the allu|&s;ion, the better to illu&s;trate my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>One is a di&s;order in the blood, and the other <HI>an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind,</HI> from the fir&s;t of which, no temperance, or art in phy&s;ic, and from the latter, not the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, or mo&s;t exerci&s;ed phi|lo&s;ophy, are able to defend us.</P>
<P>I &s;tile this &s;ort of love, <HI>an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all &s;entimental pa&s;&s;ion, or any principle in human nature&mdash;excluding all manner of de&s;ire, admiration, or e&s;teem, in|&s;pired by youth, beauty, or merit&mdash;As the&s;e may be fairly accounted for, from phy&s;ical, or moral rea&s;ons; and may con&s;equently, become effects, as often as the&s;e cau&s;es &s;hall operate.</P>
<P>But the love I mean, is a mad enthu&s;ia&s;m of the &s;oul, a &s;ingular caprice of the affections, that
<PB N="142" REF="141">
&s;ometimes, <HI>makes us doat on what,</HI> at another time, <HI>we &s;hould fear to look on.</HI> Tis <HI>a fancy, that pa&s;&s;es beauty,</HI>
<Q>Alba ligu&s;tra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur;</Q>
'Tis a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> which is enamoured of <HI>folly,</HI> a <HI>&s;ight</HI> that <HI>blinds</HI> us, a <HI>thraldom</HI> we <HI>rejoice</HI> in, a <HI>plague</HI> which we <HI>&s;olicit</HI>&mdash;In fine, a fa&s;cination, a cri&s;is, or anomalous effect, which like the operations of witchcraft, proceeds unaccountably, without any apparent cau&s;e, deducible either from rea&s;on or nature.</P>

<L>"Enamelled fields, and verdant trees.</L>

<L>"It mu&s;t be &s;ome enchanted grove,</L>
<L>"And in he leaps, and down he &s;inks."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>We often e&s;cape both <HI>infections,</HI> where one might naturally, have apprehended the greate&s;t danger, and catch them, perhaps, at a time, when we may have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to imagine any probability of our being affected. We are

often &s;truck, at fir&s;t &s;ight, and &s;ometimes, by the mo&s;t unamiable objects&mdash;So that I have known per&s;ons to catch one, as well as the other, from a &s;hock.</P>
<P>When people fancy that they have been more than once, affected by this di&s;order, it mu&s;t be by mi&s;taking &s;omething el&s;e for it, as the mea|zles often may impo&s;e it&s;elf upon the patient, for the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>There is one lucky circum&s;tance then, in which they both agree&mdash;That we are never at|tacked by either, more than once in our lives&mdash; But, alas! how &s;light our triumph, when ef|fects &s;ometimes remain for life, almo&s;t as mi|&s;erable, as the malady! <Q>Such another victory, as a certain general &s;aid, would undo me.</Q></P>

<P>THIS term compleated my college cour&s;e, and my guardian acquainted me, that he had entered my name in the Temple books. The night before I was to leave the univer&s;ity, I gave a parting &s;upper, to my &s;elect friends, among whom I had principally invited my fair Stoic. But &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf, by a billet, in which were only the&s;e words: <HI>Tender adieus are apt to leave impre&s;&s;ions&mdash;'Tis ea&s;ier to fly, than &s;trug|gle. Farewel.</HI></P>

<P>I WAS now entered upon a more enlarged &s;cene of life and action, had an unre&s;trained dominion over my own fortune, and was not accountable, either for my diligence, or idle|ne&s;s, to any one, but my&s;elf&mdash;the wor&s;t of all ma&s;ters, let people boa&s;t of liberty as much as they plea&s;e. My &s;tudies were quite of a dif|ferent nature from any thing I had been u&s;ed to read before. It was beginning &s;chool again. I would recommend <HI>Coke</HI> upon <HI>Lyttleton</HI> to be always taught, immediately after grammar, while the memory is &s;trong, and before the mind may have imbibed the lea&s;t tincture of ta&s;te, or po|lite erudition. For as the &s;tudy of it is a work of labour, not of genius, it comes to great di&s;|advantage after Virgil, Homer, Cicero, or Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="145">However, I tugged away at this oar, for &s;ome time, till the world began to get hold of me. I had more pre&s;umption than knowledge, and greater &s;pirit than judgment; which naturally, led me into two fatal errors, at once. I ima|gined, that my under&s;tanding required no far|ther improvement; and that a thou&s;and pounds a year, needed no oeconomy. I was naturally full of fire&mdash;But, for want of fuel to maintain the flame, I &s;pent my&s;elf in a blaze.</P>
<Q>Ut quondam in &s;tipul&acirc; magnus &s;ine viribus ignis.</Q>
<P>I &s;et up an equipage, and kept a pack of hounds, about ten miles from London. I hired a genteel <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> out of livery. I em|ployed the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable taylor, and left the rates of every thing, to him&s;elf. I &s;truck my&s;elf out of commons, lived in taverns; and&mdash; rented <HI>private lodgings,</HI> near the Temple.</P>
<P>I learned more of life, at this &s;chool of the world, in &s;ix months, than I had known at Oxford, in the five years that I was &s;tationed there. For though we had treble the number of &s;tudents, at the univer&s;ity, yet they were not enough their own ma&s;ters, to exhibit that infinite variety of characters, with which mankind abound. If you &s;ee one Frenchman, one Spaniard, one Ita|lian,
<PB N="147" REF="146">
you are furni&s;hed with &s;pecimens of their &s;everal nations; but you may be acquainted with an hundred Engli&s;hmen, without knowing the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>It would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k to enumerate, or de&s;cribe all the various characters I met with in this <HI>microco&s;m;</HI> &s;ome of which, indeed, exceeded to &s;uch extravagance, that they might more pro|perly be &s;tiled <HI>caracatura</HI>'s, of mankind; while others were &s;o very anomalous to human nature, that you would imagine I was de&s;cribing the te|nants of &s;ome other planet, in&s;tead of our own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This diver&s;ity was more apparent among the Templars, than in any other &s;et of men in Eng|land; becau&s;e they live more upon an equality together, and are le&s;s re&s;trained by the deco|rums of mixed &s;ocieties, where different profe&s;|&s;ions, different ranks, and different &s;exes, join. So that <HI>Every man in his humour,</HI> may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled <HI>The Temple Comedy.</HI> To which may be ad|ded one very unhappy cau&s;e al&s;o, which is, that they are, in general, tied down by no cer|tain mode, or &s;y&s;tem of religion, theirs being mere philo&s;ophic dei&s;m, alone.</P>

<P><PB N="148" REF="147">And here, gentlemen, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, as I have &s;pent &s;ome years in this &s;ociety, I think proper to ju&s;tify my&s;elf from certain &s;u&s;picions, which may po&s;&s;ibly, have ari&s;en in your minds, upon this occa&s;ion. And I will now give you a &s;incere, and ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of my faith, with regard to this mo&s;t dread, and intere&s;ting article; and which I &s;hall attempt to explain, upon the &s;imple dictates of rea&s;on alone, without the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of my&s;terious &s;y&s;tems, or venturing into the inextricable labyrinths of polemic di|vinity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. CXLII.</HI> Mr. <HI>Carewe</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, I take it for granted, that whatever there may have been, in profe&s;&s;ion and practice, there never was a real athei&s;t, in belief. Some omnipotent, omni&s;cient <HI>monad,</HI> &s;ome cau&s;e of cau&s;es, light of light, there mu&s;t have been, before all worlds, nece&s;&s;arily, inde|pendently,
<PB N="149" REF="148">
and &s;elf-exi&s;ting, coeval with eter|nity.</P>
<P>In the next place, I believe, that this intelli|gence did, by &s;ome &s;upernatural conviction, in|dependent on rea&s;on, or philo&s;ophy, manife&s;t, or reveal it&s;elf, to the fir&s;t race of mankind. I draw my argument, from the number of erro|neous, ab&s;urd, and unnatural &s;y&s;tems of reli|gions, and beliefs, which have appeared in the world, from the mo&s;t early ages of record.</P>
<P>For had religion its ri&s;e from the pretence of legi&s;lators, or been the re&s;ult of mere philo&s;ophy, the &s;cheme of it would have been contrived more con&s;onant to human rea&s;on, like that of the Turks, which is con&s;i&s;tent enough in its doctrines, though erroneous in its faith. But the pure&s;t revelation from heaven, handed down by tradition, and interpreted by prie&s;ts, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have involved both our belief and wor&s;hip, in all the impiety and bla&s;phemy, of the heathen rites, and pagan &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, with Socrates at their head, finding the world in &s;o forlorn a &s;tate, cried out to Heaven, for a new revelation, to di&s;pel the mi&s;ts of ignorance, and reduce our wanderings into the right line. It was rea&s;ona|ble to hope for &s;uch a guide, from the goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice of our Creator; and from our know|ledge
<PB N="150" REF="149">
and experience of the ways of Providence, I firmly believe, that whatever is be&s;t to do, it always does perform.</P>
<P>I think that the Chri&s;tian religion has at length &s;upplied this great <HI>de&s;ideratum,</HI> by conveying to us the mo&s;t perfect moral, and the pure&s;t wor|&s;hip, that ever yet was propo&s;ed to man. If we remain &s;till in error, 'tis &s;urely the &s;afe&s;t one we can po&s;&s;ibly fall into. For the proofs, both in|ternal, and external, are &s;o con&s;i&s;tently framed, that the whole wit and philo&s;ophy of mankind, cannot defend from the illu&s;ion. We err with &s;aints, we err with wi&s;dom, we err with virtue, we err with piety; we err with infidelity con|verted, and te&s;tifying its conviction through the martyrdom of death and tortures! Heaven mu&s;t then, either reward our faith with glory, accept the will in atonement for the deed; or pardon with impunity that error, which it&s;elf hath &s;uf|fered to be with &s;o much plau&s;ibility impo&s;ed upon us.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider then, a dei&s;t, who writes, or ar|gues, upon the <HI>religion of nature,</HI> alone, as he cannot po&s;&s;ibly be an infidel to Chri&s;tianity, upon conviction, to be an immoral man, and a dan|gerous citizen of the world. We have, alas! too frequent, and &s;ad experience of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;anctions of rewards and puni&s;hments, being
<PB N="151" REF="150">
too weak for the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men; and whoever would attempt to &s;et us &s;till more at liberty from the re&s;traints of virtue, mu&s;t probably, have conceived &s;ome mi&s;taken intere&s;t in the indulgences of their own vice, or in the tempting of others to the &s;ame fatal latitude.</P>
<P>In fine, without ever entering into a religious argument, upon the &s;ubject, we may venture to pronounce a profe&s;&s;ed athei&s;t, or dei&s;t, to be ei|ther fool, or knave; becau&s;e they but di&s;courage the good, and &s;et the bad more at liberty.</P>
<Q><L>Fear fir&s;t <HI>made gods,</HI> the impious athei&s;t cries,</L>
<L>And fear <HI>unmade them,</HI> the divine replies.</L></Q>
<P>An athei&s;t is certainly, the mo&s;t <HI>credulous</HI> fool breathing. He <HI>believes,</HI> contrary to all philo&s;o|phy, that matter produced motion fir&s;t, and that then, they both laid their heads together, and created intelligence.</P>
<P>We cannot conceive <HI>thought</HI> to be immaterial, &s;ay &s;ome philo&s;ophers; but can they conceive matter to be intelligent? We are con&s;cious of our own ideas, therefore we have undoubtedly a conception, of &s;omewhat, di&s;tinct from <HI>matter.</HI></P>
<P>It is much more philo&s;ophic to imagine, with Berkley, an univer&s;e of <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> than with Hobbes, an univer&s;e of <HI>matter;</HI> for it is certainly, more rational to think, that &s;pirit might <HI>create,</HI> or, ac|cording
<PB N="152" REF="151">
to Berkley's metaphy&s;ical refinement, <HI>impre&s;s the idea of matter,</HI> than to &s;uppo&s;e, that mere <HI>matter</HI> could ever rou&s;e it&s;elf, to thought, or action.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXLIII.</HEAD>
<P>I DID not think it proper or decent, to in|terrupt Mr. Carewe, while he was <HI>at con|fe&s;&s;ion;</HI> for though I &s;ometimes, pretend to be jocular, give me leave to a&s;&s;ure the reader, that the greate&s;t heathen of Greece, or Rome, ne|ver had an higher re&s;pect for virtue, nor the dul|le&s;t par&s;on in a country cure, a more &s;tedfa&s;t faith in the Chri&s;tian religion, than the per&s;on who here a&s;&s;umes the title of <HI>Biographer Tri|glyph.</HI></P>
<P>This being premi&s;ed, and finding that Mr. Ca|rewe does not chu&s;e to treat you with a de&s;crip|tion of any of the characters he hints at, as it would lead him into &s;ome &s;atyrical &s;trictures, which are, by no means, his turn of wit, I &s;hall here entertain you with one &s;tory, out of his budget, which is a mo&s;t extraordinary, and cer|tain
<PB N="153" REF="152">
matter of fact, already known to many of my London readers:</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="story">
<HEAD>The &s;tory of the <HI>Weeping Cull.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of Mr. Carewe's friends was a man of remarkable good &s;en&s;e, and agreeable manners; but of a very grave deportment, and a &s;erious air; which however, did not appear to be natural to him, as he had a lively eye, an healthful &s;tate of body, a florid complexion, and &s;eemed to be fond of company.</P>
<P>He had been a re&s;ident there, for three years beyond the <HI>terms</HI> requi&s;ite to be called to the bar; and could not be deemed a &s;tudent, in any &s;en&s;e, at this time, for he neither read law, divinity, humanity, or prophanity. He u&s;ed to &s;pend mo&s;t of his mornings, in riding or walk|ing; and his evenings, in the &s;ociety of a few friends. He was a &s;ober man, of good morals, and a con&s;tant churchman, twice a day.</P>
<P>Once a week, on every Thur&s;day, he kept a fa&s;t, till night, and toward the du&s;k of the evening, after prayers, u&s;ed con&s;tantly, on that day, to take his &s;tation, on the Strand, to &s;ee <HI>the girls of the town</HI> pa&s;s in review before him, till he had fixed upon his object, whom he would invite home to his own chambers, to
<PB N="154" REF="153">
&s;upper. He did not generally pitch upon the hand&s;ome&s;t wench, for he cho&s;e always one of a particular de&s;cription. She mu&s;t be tall and fair, but pale and red-haired.</P>
<P>He would treat her with an elegant collation, and a bottle of wine. Would &s;up with her, and make her &s;ing, if &s;he happened to have any manner of voice; he would drink two or three gla&s;&s;es of wine, and then walk mu&s;ing about the room till &s;he had fini&s;hed the remainder of the bottle; which if &s;he happened to delay too long, he would grow impatient, and pre&s;s her to, with all the &s;eeming ardour of a lover.</P>
<P>When &s;he had drank the buzza, he would very politely take her by the hand, and lead her into an inner apartment, which was lighted up with half a dozen large wax tapers. There was no bed in this room, but a large oak table in the middle of it; upon which was placed a very hand&s;ome cedar coffin, lined with white &s;attin, neatly crimped and quilted, with the foot of it placed directly oppo&s;ite to the door.</P>
<P>Then taking up a fine pinked &s;hroud, he would put it into the girl's hand, and a guinea into the other, de&s;iring her to &s;trip her&s;elf to her &s;hift, and lie down in the coffin, ju&s;t like a corp&s;e, with her arms placed cro&s;s-wi&s;e over her bo&s;om, and her eyes &s;hut; and when &s;he had
<PB N="155" REF="154">
compo&s;ed her&s;elf in this manner, to expre&s;s one heavy moan, and then remain motionle&s;s and &s;ilent, as the grave. While this &s;ad office was performing, he would, through decency, retire out of the room, and wait at the door, till he heard the &s;igh, or &s;ignal of admi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He would then, open the door, &s;oftly, as if he apprehended he was going to pay a vi&s;it to the &s;ick, and march up &s;lowly, to the foot of the coffin; then &s;tart, as if &s;urprized, &s;tand agha&s;t, wring his hands, take out his handker|chief, and move &s;tep by &s;tep, up to the head of the coffin; &s;obbing, weeping, and &s;ighing, all the way, as if lamenting over &s;ome dear and real lo&s;s. Then, after gazing for &s;ome minutes on her face, he would lay his hand gently on the brea&s;t of the living corp&s;e, &s;toop down his head, and give her a parting and a pa&s;&s;ionate ki&s;s. This ob&s;equy performed, he would im|mediately retire out of the room, leaving the girl at lei&s;ure to re-dre&s;s her&s;elf, and walk about her bu&s;ine&s;s, in que&s;t of more lively &s;port.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, when he took up this very odd fancy, it was with great difficulty he could get a girl to undergo this di&s;mal ceremony; e&s;pecially, as the very idea of death, mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;hocking reflections, to reprobates. Be&s;ides, they were not aware how far the farce might have been
<PB N="156" REF="155">
intended to be carried on; &s;o that it u&s;ed to co&s;t him three, four, &s;ometimes five, or &s;ix guineas, to purcha&s;e a corp&s;e, to his mind. But in a &s;hort time, he became &s;o well known on the Strand, that he was &s;tiled <HI>The Weeping Cull,</HI> and whenever he appeared, all the long, gho&s;t-like gingers, u&s;ed to crowd about him, and offer them&s;elves voluntarily, to perform a &s;cene in his tragedy; which reduced the price, at length, to a &s;upper and a guinea.</P>
<P>His &s;tory was this: He had been, for &s;ome years, in love with a young lady, of the de&s;crip|tion in the latter end of the third paragraph, of this chapter. She returned his pa&s;&s;ion with a reciprocal flame; but her father, who was a rich citizen of London, oppo&s;ed their union, becau&s;e &s;he was his only child, and that he was in hopes of matching her into &s;ome decayed noble family, who&s;e <HI>arms</HI> might want <HI>&s;up|porters.</HI></P>
<P>The lovers were immediately &s;eparated, upon the fir&s;t overture of the match, and became in|con&s;olable. But the lady, having a more tender &s;en&s;e of &s;uch di&s;appointments, pined for &s;ome time, fell afterwards into a decay, and the phy|&s;icians at length began to de&s;pair of her recovery. Her father was moved at this report, con&s;ented
<PB N="157" REF="156">
to the marriage, and gave her leave to acquaint her lover with the news.</P>
<P>He was, at this time, near an hundred miles from London, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, about five hundred pounds a year, upon his fa|ther's death. The moment he received the joy|ful &s;ummons, he mounted his hor&s;e, and rode off, po&s;t, to London. When he arrived, he found the hou&s;e open, and &s;tole up &s;tairs di|rectly to her apartment, without meeting any body in his way; but when he opened the cham|ber-door, and was going to ru&s;h into the arms of his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;aw her ju&s;t laid in her coffin.</P>
<P>He grew immediately di&s;tracted, fell into a fever, and was confined to his bed and room, for near &s;ix months, before he recovered his health and rea&s;on. Some part of the phrenzy &s;till remained with him. There is a plea&s;ure in indulging gloomy reflections. He was re&s;olved to enjoy them; and immediately in&s;tituted the above funeral rite to her memory, to be per|formed weekly, on her <HI>death-day.</HI> Which ex|traordinary and fune&s;t extravagance, he had continued for above a year, when Mr. Carewe quitted the Temple, and re&s;olved to per&s;evere in, during the remainder of his life.</P>

<P>SOON after I had been &s;ettled at the Tem|ple, continued Mr. Carewe, I received a letter from the fair Divorc&eacute;e, which had been returned to me from Oxford. It was in the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Tru&s;tee,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t half year of my alimony, will be due to-morrow. I am di&s;tre&s;s'd for money. I beg the favour of you to di&s;charge it imme|diately&mdash;without <HI>advice,</HI> which I hate. I lodge at Mr. Seawell's, merchant, in Leadenhall-&s;treet, London, and am, dear guardian, your dutiful ward, and affectionate humble &s;ervant.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This hint rendered me unea&s;y. She had be|trayed dangerous principles, and I was afraid of entering into any manner of connection with her. I did not care to have her name joined to mine, on my fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world. Men's characters are generally marked, though very unfairly, by their fir&s;t &s;teps in life. 'Tis hard to judge of per&s;ons, at an age when their pa&s;&s;ions are &s;tronge&s;t, their di&s;cretion weake&s;t, and their
<PB N="159" REF="158">
experience lea&s;t. My fir&s;t adventure with that lady, was <HI>naturally</HI> unavoidable. This would have been <HI>morally</HI> premeditative.</P>
<P>Upon this reflection, I immediately &s;at down and drew a bill upon her hu&s;band, for the half year's &s;tipend; which received due honour by the return of the po&s;t. The next day, I went to the Royal Exchage, inquired for Mr. Seawell, and paid him the money, for his fair lodger; taking his receipt, in her name. I de&s;ired him to deliver my compliments to the lady, and make an apology for my not waiting on her, at that time; as I was then going out of town, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXLV.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ma&s;querade that was exhibited in London, after my entrance at the Tem|ple, I prepared my&s;elf for, in the gaye&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;uperb manner I could devi&s;e. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf perfectly <HI>en Turc,</HI> and carried the folly to &s;uch extravagance, that the expences of my ha|bit, and appurtenances, amounted to above an hundred pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159">The vanity of human nature is unaccounta|ble, in &s;ome things. What po&s;&s;ible advantage or enjoyment, could I have purpo&s;ed to my&s;elf, from &s;o magnificent an appearance; unknowing others, and my&s;elf unknown? To &s;pend mo|ney upon pa&s;&s;ions, or pur&s;uits, is defen&s;ible, but 'tis really, a &s;ort of <HI>&s;uicide</HI> in oeconomy, to &s;tab one's fortune, without having either plea&s;ure or profit in view.</P>
<P>The oddne&s;s and variety of the appearances, &s;urpri&s;ed and diverted me, for &s;ome time; but I &s;oon grew tired of the farce; and felt my&s;elf offended at &s;eeing human nature &s;o deformed, and &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed. I had no rational amu&s;e|ment here, for I could neither enjoy &s;ociety, nor &s;oliloquy. At one time, I compared my&s;elf to Adam, when he had collected together all the animals of the creation, to call them names. At another time, a more &s;erious image occurred to me, of the <HI>la&s;t day,</HI> when all the various na|tions of the earth, &s;hall be gathered into one groupe, for <HI>judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Such reflections, with the intolerable warmth of the room, &s;oon began to lower my &s;pirits, and I retired frequently, to the &s;ide-boards, to recruit them. I happened to drink too freely there; and afterwards, ingaged too indi&s;creetly at play, with a &s;ett of per&s;ons who&s;e characters
<PB N="161" REF="160">
I was as little acquainted with, as with their ma&s;ks.</P>
<P>I had the misfortune to have won con&s;iderably at fir&s;t, which excited my pa&s;&s;ion, and joined to the wine, threw me intirely off my guard. I pu&s;hed away at every thing, accepted all manner of betts, without waiting to compute the odds, and lo&s;t and won, by turns, without ever con|&s;idering how the balance of accounts &s;tood for, or again&s;t me; till upon the &s;umming up of the reckoning, at the clo&s;e of the night, I found my&s;elf indebted to &s;undry unknowns, to the amount of three thou&s;and, five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf in a very aukward and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, at this period, as I had not above three hundred pounds about me, at that time. I took off my ma&s;k, to let my creditors &s;ee that I was not afraid to &s;hew my face, though at the &s;ame time, I acknowledged to them, that I was a&s;hamed to do it; that I was unu&s;ed to play, and had ingaged my&s;elf, unawares, beyond my pre&s;ent means. I told them that I was a per&s;on of fortune, &s;ufficient to an&s;wer their demands, and offered to go with them to a tavern, and pa&s;s &s;ecurities for their re&s;pective claims.</P>
<P>They refu&s;ed me this indulgence, &s;aid that play-debts were not recoverable at law, that it was probable a man who could, among perfect &s;tran|gers,
<PB N="162" REF="161">
accept of betts, beyond his pur&s;e, might be likely to <HI>plead the &s;tatute,</HI> when called upon for payment; that they were gentlemen, per&s;ons of honour, would be treated as &s;uch; and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>While they were, one and all, bullying after this manner, they &s;urrounded me, and &s;eemed to make one common cau&s;e of it, as in truth, I believe they were an a&s;&s;ociated gang; &s;o that I had great rea&s;on to apprehend &s;ome har&s;h treat|ment, or unhappy event, from this fooli&s;h ad|venture; from which I was preparing to defend my&s;elf, after the be&s;t manner I could, and had ju&s;t laid my hand to my &s;cymetar, when a little man, in a domino, who had &s;tood clo&s;e by my &s;ide, from the time I had entered into play, and had frequently warned me, unheeded, inter|po&s;ed on my behalf, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the banditti, &s;aid that he did not look upon the debt in &s;uch a de&s;perate light as they &s;eemed to do; that from my dre&s;s, my <HI>indi&s;cretion,</HI> and my ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e me to be a young man of <HI>modern</HI> fa&s;hion. That, ac|cording to the game&s;ter's phra&s;e, he was ready to <HI>back his opinion with his money,</HI> and that, if they would but wait his return, for a few mi|nutes, he would bring ca&s;h &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy their demands.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="162">He retired immediately, took a chair, came &s;oon back, with Ea&s;t-India bonds to the amount of my debts, and divided them among the ad|venturers, in proportion to their claims. I was affected with a proper &s;en&s;e of gratitude, upon this occa&s;ion, and invited the little Domino to a tavern, in order to pa&s;s a &s;ecurity to him for his generous loan; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying, that he was in reality, an u&s;urer, that a &s;imple obligation would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, and he would wait upon me, the next morning, to breakfa&s;t, and there propo&s;e his terms. I thanked him, however, and gave him my addre&s;s&mdash;We then &s;hook hands, and parted.</P>
<P>I was extremely happy, at having got &s;o well rid of this unluky adventure, and quitted that <HI>grote&s;que</HI> a&s;&s;embly, with a full re&s;olution of never wearing a fool's coat there, again, during my life. Ju&s;t as I was going out, I was acco&s;ted by a female ma&s;k, in a Grecian habit, and of an engaging figure, who addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to me, in the&s;e words&mdash;I am in a difficult &s;ituation, <HI>Seignior,</HI> I have mi&s;&s;ed my company, in the crowd, I am afraid of venturing home alone, and beg leave to place my&s;elf under your <HI>Highne&s;s</HI>'s protection, to convey me &s;afe to my lodgings.</P>
<P>Yours, extempore, &s;aid I, then taking her by the hand, put her into a chair, de&s;iring her to
<PB N="164" REF="163">
lead the way, and followed her in another. When we &s;topped at her door, I bad her farewel, and directed my chair to the Temple; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my going in to drink a gla&s;s of wine, and receive the thanks of her friends, for my politene&s;s and galantry toward her.</P>
<P>I bowed obei&s;ance, handed her into the hou&s;e, &s;he led me into her own apartments, then &s;hut|ting the door, let fall her ma&s;k, and &s;prang my fair Divorc&eacute;e into my arms. &mdash;</P>

<P>THE reader, perhaps, may here inquire, how the Divorc&eacute;e &s;hould know Mr. Ca|rewe's name, and addre&s;s, or he him&s;elf happen to be informed of either of the&s;e particulars, re|lative to her hu&s;band; as none of them appear to have been provided for, already. But it is more than probable, that the tru&s;t-deed, between the&s;e parties, was drawn up by the attorney,
<PB N="165" REF="164">
with all the u&s;ual forms and requi&s;ites; among which, the real names of the contractors, with their additions, and abodes, are always fully expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, that my friend, Mr. Carewe, has rather too &s;uccinct a manner of telling a &s;tory&mdash;too little of the <HI>narrative,</HI> by a great deal. Witne&s;s the clo&s;e of the la&s;t chap|ter, with many other di&s;appointing in&s;tances, of the &s;ame kind, in various and &s;undry places of his memoirs. He might, perhaps, have been pardonable for omitting tho&s;e <HI>minutiae,</HI> at fir&s;t, becau&s;e he might not have immediately fore&s;een that they would be nece&s;&s;ary in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tory; but here he was certainly inexcu&s;a|ble to neglect it, and &s;hould have interrupted him&s;elf, with a <Q>But, Gentlemen, fir&s;t it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that"&mdash;Or, "I had forgot to mention to ye, in the former part of my adventure with this &s;ame lady, how &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I would give fifty guineas, with all my heart, that this &s;ame laconic <HI>Triumvirate</HI> had been bet|ter read, than they appear to be, in the modern novels and memoirs which are publi&s;hed here every day; and I would ingage to make cent. per cent. of my money, by it, too. For there is certainly, matter &s;ufficient, in their &s;tories, to
<PB N="166" REF="165">
have <HI>furni&s;hed out</HI> a third volume to this work, had they been properly &s;killed in the manner, &s;tile, and conduct, of &s;uch performances. But &s;o far from &s;upplying me with any helps of this kind, I really think that I &s;hould hardly have &s;queezed out more than a &s;ingle volume, from among this co&s;tive <HI>Trio,</HI> if I had not eked out a &s;econd, by the addre&s;s of introducing my&s;elf &s;o often, no matter how impertinently, into the &s;cene, and <HI>choru&s;&s;ing</HI> it away, chapter after chap|ter, in the manner I am holding forth at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>I agree with Mr. Carewe, intirely, that ma&s;querades can never an&s;wer any fair purpo&s;e, in England. It might have been a good contri|vance enough, in Italy, where they were fir&s;t contrived, becau&s;e the only freedom that nation enjoys, is under a <HI>vizard.</HI> But, to adopt &s;uch a <HI>&s;creen</HI> in the&s;e kingdoms, was really &s;uperfluous, And the pre&s;ent age &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible of this ab&s;urdity, at la&s;t; for ma&s;querades have been abo|li&s;hed of late, &s;ince liberty has become &s;o very <HI>bare-faced,</HI> as it appears to be in the&s;e days.</P>
<P>You &s;ee here, another mere ca&s;ual adventure, of poor Mr. Carewe's. He had taken all pru|dent means, and virtuous re&s;olutions, imagina|ble, again&s;t renewing any manner of commerce with this very dangerous woman&mdash;But, he hap|pened to take off his ma&s;k, at play, and &s;he im|mediately
<PB N="167" REF="166">
lays violent hands upon him. Now what &s;ecurity, in this wicked world, for male cha&s;tity! For if men &s;hould ever become coy, women will mo&s;t certainly, ply &s;tratagem again&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. CXLVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, I ro&s;e early, my double obligations to my little Domino, both of equity and honour, ren|dered me unea&s;y. The fair Divorc&eacute;e pre&s;&s;ed me to be frequent in my vi&s;its, I promi&s;ed, her maid lent me a riding-hood to conceal my <HI>Grand Seignior&s;hip,</HI> and led me out through a back door, into a private alley. I &s;oon met a chair, and re|turned plea&s;ed, and di&s;&s;atisfied; re&s;olving, and irre&s;olute; home to my chambers in the Temple.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, my friend Domino called upon me, and brought a bond, ready filled up, for the money exactly, which he had advanced for me the night before. I thought it prudent in him not to add the fee of u&s;ury, in the <HI>obligation,</HI> but after I had &s;igned the deed,
<PB N="168" REF="167">
I threw my pur&s;e upon the table, and de&s;ired him to pay him&s;elf whatever <HI>gratuity</HI> he plea&s;ed, out of it.</P>
<P>But he declined my offer, &s;aying, that the expre&s;&s;ion he had thrown out, the night before, was merely made u&s;e of to conceal him&s;elf the better&mdash;That he never had dealt in u&s;ury or extortion; but being ca&s;hier to a <HI>company</HI> of merchants in the city, he u&s;ually attended, in|cog. at public places of play, in order to pick up &s;ecurities for money which he could venture to make free with; and which it might be im|prudent in him to hazard in trade, or lend out in the offices of <HI>notaries,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould <HI>take wind</HI> among the <HI>company.</HI></P>
<P>Then putting the bond into his pocket, and ri&s;ing up from his &s;eat, I hope, Sir, &s;aid he, that this tran&s;action, in&s;tead of a debt, may be|come a purcha&s;e to you. A proper reflection upon this marked occa&s;ion, may turn your lo&s;s to gain. The entering into play, in your cir|cum&s;tances of fortune, &s;ufficient, but not a|bounding, is, give me leave to &s;ay, unpardon|ble indi&s;cretion. 'Tis ri&s;quing what you want, for what you do not need. 'Tis Ae&s;op's fable exactly, hazarding the &s;ub&s;tance, to gra&s;p the &s;hadow.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="168">You &s;eem, Sir, continued he, to be a young man, ju&s;t entering into life, of a liberal, and in|genuous nature, and a few more admonitions, from experience, may, and I hope will, be both u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to you. Always leave your pur&s;e at home, never carrying more money about you, than the probable expences of the day; for you'll find more <HI>borrowers</HI> than <HI>lenders,</HI> in this world, believe me. As you &s;hould con|ceal your vices, out of decency, &s;o &s;hould you even your very virtues, out of prudence; other|wi&s;e, the lea&s;t worthy objects, being the mo&s;t forward, will be apt to throw them&s;elves in your way, preventing mode&s;t merit. Seek occa&s;ion, rather than &s;uffer it to &s;eek you; and let your liberality be the re&s;ult of virtue, not of weakne&s;s. This &s;aid, he bowed, and retired.</P>
<P>He was a mean-looking, middle-aged man, and mechanically dre&s;&s;ed, which made his re|fu&s;ing the praemium, with the officious friend|&s;hip which he te&s;tified toward me upon this occa&s;ion, &s;eem the more unaccountable, and extraordinary. In fine, his words and actions were &s;o much above his appearances, that I could only reconcile them in my mind, by &s;etting the whole of this matter down to the account of <HI>character,</HI> with which, as I ob&s;erved before, our nation &s;o peculiarly abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="169">His exhortation had this good effect upon me, that I immediately put down my equipage, and di&s;po&s;ed of my hounds and hunters in the country.</P>

<P>I HAD promi&s;ed the Divorc&eacute;e to &s;ee her again, and accordingly paid her a vi&s;it in a few days after, with a purpo&s;e though, of with|drawing my&s;elf from any manner of future en|gagement with her, but without that abruptne&s;s which would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the decorums of galantry. It was in the evening, I found her at home, and Mrs. Seawell, at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lodged, at tea with her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seawell was about twenty years old, and had been two years married. Her hu&s;band had been a widower, and appeared to me, when I &s;aw him on the Exchange, to be above &s;ixty. She was of a middle &s;tature, fair and plump; &s;he had bright dark che&s;nut-coloured hair, and very white teeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anne of Au&s;tria u&s;ed to &s;ay, that good teeth were the mo&s;t <HI>natural</HI> beauty, becau&s;e the only one that was of <HI>real u&s;e.</HI></NOTE>; but what was extremely
<PB N="171" REF="170">
remarkable, they were naturally brilliant cut, &s;o that when &s;he &s;poke, or &s;miled, the glittering &s;pangles would catch the eye, and rivet your attention, like the ba&s;ili&s;k.</P>
<P>Her other features were nothing extraordinary, except her eyes, which were a dark blue, with more of langui&s;hment than &s;pirit in them; but &s;he had a certain <HI>riantcy</HI> about the lower part of her face, which was extremely captivating. In fine, the contra&s;ted air of her features, might well be compared to a <HI>tragi-comedy,</HI> there was &s;uch a mixture of mirth and melancholy in them.</P>
<P>She did not appear to have much under&s;tand|ing, but whenever I &s;poke, &s;he &s;eemed to &s;hew an attention that was flattering; and when I hap|pened occa&s;ionally, to throw out any little com|pliment of galantry toward her, it would in|&s;tantly diffu&s;e &s;uch an air of <HI>aukward fondne&s;s,</HI> o'er all her countenance, as was at once ex|pre&s;&s;ive, both of pa&s;&s;ion, and compliance.</P>
<P>We three played parties of picquette, and &s;up|ped together. It was po&s;t-night, and Mr. Sea|well did not quit his office, while I &s;taid. Nor indeed, did either of the ladies &s;end any very pre&s;&s;ing me&s;&s;ages to invite him up &s;tairs. I di|vided my addre&s;&s;es as equally as I could, between them, felt my &s;ituation difficult and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing,

promi&s;ed that my vi&s;its &s;hould be frequent, and retired home to the Temple&mdash;No&mdash;It was to my <HI>private lodgings</HI> near it&mdash;Chanting out Mac|heath's &s;ong to my&s;elf, all the way.</P>

<P>THE next day, &s;ome young Templars dined with me, we went in the evening, to the play, picked up more company there, and went all together, to &s;upper at a tavern. Here, gen|tlemen, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, I blu&s;h to own, that I was a &s;econd time, led into deep play; though without de&s;igning, or de&s;iring it. But re&s;olution was never among my heroics; and I have ever been the &s;lave of my company. One is too apt to be a&s;hamed of di&s;&s;enting from their fellows, and fal&s;e mode&s;ty is a pimp to vice. I lo&s;t at fir&s;t, and pu&s;hing away to retrieve my&s;elf, was finally involved for four thou&s;and pounds&mdash;Pur|cha&s;ing anxiety at the rate of a thou&s;and pounds an hour.</P>
<P>I could not &s;leep all night; I felt &s;hocked at my own madne&s;s; I recollected my good friend Domino's advice, too late, and eked it out
<PB N="173" REF="172">
with more &s;evere reflections of my own. Gaming is a <HI>vice,</HI> not a <HI>pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions have bounds, vices none&mdash;It &s;hould not be called a <HI>love,</HI> but a <HI>lu&s;t</HI> of play&mdash;'Tis not <HI>natural,</HI> but <HI>accidental,</HI> to mankind. What Addi&s;on &s;ays of <HI>&s;wearing,</HI> may be here applied; that no one can plead the being born of <HI>a gaming con&s;titution.</HI> Ambition is con|nate; 'tis emulation; it both excites, and exer|ci&s;es noble and generous faculties; it has, or may have, &s;ome great and liberal end in view. Play is merely &s;elfi&s;h; and confines the &s;oul to mean and &s;ordid objects. No man ever yet ventured his fortune on the die, with a purpo&s;e of relieving the poor, a&s;&s;i&s;ting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or re&s;cuing an oppre&s;&s;ed people, with his &s;ucce&s;s. A game&s;ter comprehends the character, both of fool and knave; for he &s;ets out <HI>a dupe,</HI> and re|turns <HI>a &s;harper.</HI> But what &s;ignify all &s;uch re|flections! the world will never be the better for them&mdash;For 'tis not <HI>&s;ober coun&s;el,</HI> but <HI>&s;ad experience,</HI> that will ever make men wi&s;e!</P>

<P>THE next morning, I began to meditate upon methods of di&s;charging this mo&s;t irk&s;ome incumbrance, and recollecting that I had &s;ome valuable woods on my e&s;tate, I wrote directly to my agent, to get them valued, and then come up to London. He did as I had directed, and told me the purcha&s;e was com|puted at about five thou&s;and pounds; upon which I de&s;ired him to publi&s;h the &s;ale in the papers; comforting my&s;elf after my too carele&s;s manner, that tho&s;e trees, which had been before, but <HI>ne&s;ts for ravens,</HI> were likely now, to become <HI>habitations for men.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the adverti&s;ement had appeared in print, I received a vi&s;it from my extraordinary friend, the little Domino, who, after &s;ome &s;hort intercour&s;e of civility, a&s;ked me what &s;udden emergency had pre&s;&s;ed upon me, &s;ince our part|ing, to &s;acrifice <HI>the honours,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, of my e&s;tate? Has any public calamity fal|len upon the times? Is &s;ome dear friend, or fond connection, langui&s;hing at pre&s;ent, in a gaol? Or&mdash;I was piqued at his &s;arca&s;m, and interrupted him peevi&s;hly, with &s;aying, that of|ten

the heavie&s;t circum&s;tance of being in debt, was the rendering one&s;elf liable to the overbear|ing in&s;olence of pur&s;e-proud creditors; that I was not accountable to any per&s;on what&s;oever, for the exerci&s;e of a dominion over my own e&s;tate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Domino collected him&s;elf, upon this rebuke, and made an apology for the freedom he had u&s;ed, by a&s;&s;uring me that he came to wait upon me, merely as a friend, and was pre|pared to advance whatever &s;um I might need, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in order to &s;pare my woods, which he told me he was informed would not be in a condition to fell with advan|tage, for &s;everal years to come.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf a&s;hamed at the folly and extra|vagance which had humbled me to &s;uch morti|fying circum&s;tances; my re&s;entment imme|diately &s;ub&s;ided, I thanked him for his friendly offer, accepted it, pa&s;&s;ed my bond to him for four thou&s;and pounds, and ran to di&s;charge my notes of <HI>honour,</HI> on the in&s;tant.</P>

<P>WHEN I had compo&s;ed my&s;elf a little after this di&s;agreeable adventure, I went to amu&s;e my&s;elf, one morning to Leadenhall-&s;treet. I found the two ladies &s;itting together, and Mrs. Seawell attempting to read a French book into Engli&s;h, for the entertainment of her friend, who did not under&s;tand a word of the language.</P>
<P>She &s;topped, on my coming in, but I begged &s;he would proceed for a page or two, that I might be able to judge how far &s;he was a mi&s;|tre&s;s of French. She read on a little farther, but finding her to be a mere <HI>dictionary &s;cholar,</HI> like mo&s;t of our modern tran&s;lators, I took the book out of her hand, and con&s;trued a few pages with an ea&s;e and fluency which plea&s;ed them both.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Le Sopha;</HI> and coming to that pa&s;&s;age, where the writer, &s;peaking of the pronene&s;s to intrigue, in women, imputes it principally, &agrave; le <HI>de &s;aeuvremnt</HI> perp&eacute;tuel dans lequel elles langui&s;&s;ent, I &s;hut the book, crying out in a tran&s;port, Deus no|bis <HI>haec otia</HI> fecit! and putting it into my pocket, a&s;ked the ladies to take the air with me a little
<PB N="177" REF="176">
way out of town, promi&s;ing that I would fini&s;h the remainder of the novel for them, in the coach. They accepted the invitation, and we drove off to Ranelagh together.</P>
<P>The day was fine, and after we had walked a turn or two, in the gardens, we &s;at our&s;elves down in an arbour, and the ladies claimed my promi&s;e of reading the Sopha to them. To which I replied, that I would fir&s;t give Mrs. Sea|well &s;ome in&s;tructions in French, as &s;he &s;eemed to need only a few le&s;&s;ons in the <HI>auxiliaries,</HI> to become a compleat &s;cholar. The dear pupil appeared plea&s;ed at my propo&s;al, the other lady oppo&s;ed it, but being out-voted, was obliged to &s;it dully, and impatiently by.</P>
<P>I then began pedantically enough, with the verb <HI>avoir,</HI> and went very &s;eriou&s;ly, through the indicative and imperative <HI>moods;</HI> but when I came to the <HI>optative, potential,</HI> and <HI>&s;ubjunctive</HI> parts of the <HI>conjugation,</HI> the very titles hinted an applicable &s;ubject to me; &s;o digre&s;&s;ing from old grammar, I laid hold of this opportunity, of telling her in French, that the difficulty of &s;epa|rating her from her companion, had reduced me to this <HI>ru&s;e d'amour,</HI> to frame an occa&s;ion of de|claring the pure&s;t, and warme&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for her, that I had been &s;truck at fir&s;t &s;ight, and this &s;o &s;trongly too, that ages could neither increa&s;e nor

dimini&s;h my flame&mdash;That&mdash;But here perceiving her countenance falling into &s;ome confu&s;ion, I quick &s;hifted my di&s;cour&s;e to &s;ome of the <HI>ten&s;es</HI> of the <HI>verb,</HI> and then &s;peaking to her in Engli&s;h, de&s;ired her to repeat any &s;peech, p&s;alm, or prayer, &s;he had by heart, in French, in order to try her pronunciation.</P>
<P>She then &s;poke a &s;tanza or two of <HI>Une Chan&s;on &agrave; boire;</HI> and having by that time, recovered her|&s;elf a little, concluded it by thanking me for the compliment I had paid her, and a&s;&s;uring me, in a &s;ort of he&s;itating voice, and embarra&s;&s;ed man|ner, that while I &s;hould pre&s;erve the decorums of <HI>Platonics,</HI> which was all her <HI>pre&s;ent circum&s;tances</HI> could admit of, &s;he would return my pa&s;&s;ion with the warme&s;t friend&s;hip and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>All this &s;he &s;poke in a broken and interrupted manner, as if &s;he was only trying to recollect the remainder of her &s;ong; then &s;peaking in Engli&s;h, &s;aid, with an arch &s;mile, that this was enough for the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on, and turning to her friend, cried, Indeed, my dear, you mi&s;s a va&s;t plea&s;ure, in not under&s;tanding French.

<P>AFTER this manner, and in walking, we amu&s;ed the time, till Mrs. Seawell, look|ing at her watch, told us it was ju&s;t three o'clock, and full time to &s;et out toward London. I was &s;ent off, to order the coach to the door, and returning &s;oon back led the ladies into a little parlour, where a &s;mall, but elegant colla|tion had been prepared, by my private direc|tions on our fir&s;t coming into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;eated my&s;elf at the table, in|treating the favour of my fair gue&s;ts to take their places on each &s;ide of me, which the Divorc&eacute;e readily con&s;ented to, and placed her|&s;elf directly on my right hand; but Mrs. Sea|well he&s;itated a little, le&s;t her hu&s;band might be di&s;plea&s;ed at her &s;taying abroad, without notice. The other laughed at her &s;cruples, &s;aying, My dear friend, 'tis good policy &s;ometimes, to act a little irregularly, in innocent and indif|ferent

matters, &s;o &s;hall you be at liberty in things of higher moment. Practi&s;e &s;wimming, my girl, within your depth, and it may &s;ave you at a plunge. She &s;miled, and blu&s;hed.

<P>We were each of us extremely lively, drank bri&s;kly, exhau&s;ted all the <HI>modern</HI> wit of <HI>&s;entimen|tal</HI> toa&s;ting, and our whole conver&s;ation was &s;upported with &s;pirit and galantry. The Di|vorc&eacute;e &s;poke her opinions pretty freely, upon this latter &s;ubject; and while &s;he meant only to ju&s;tify her own <HI>amour,</HI> &s;he was, without per|ceiving, or intending it, a&s;&s;i&s;ting mine.</P>
<P>When we had got into the coach, to return to London, I propo&s;ed to my pretty pupil, that we &s;hould conver&s;e in French together, for a while, upon any common topic, ju&s;t to try how far &s;he had profited of my le&s;&s;ons, in the morning. The other lady, who in truth preferred <HI>plain Engli&s;h,</HI> objected, but was, as before, over-ruled in the que&s;tion, which left us again at our liberty.</P>
<P>I took advantage of this &s;econd favourable cri&s;is, to urge my now increa&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, with the united warmth of youth and wine; to which &s;he an&s;wered, in a tender accent, that if &s;he had

<P>WE three had frequent parties together in London, at the play, the tavern, and the china-&s;hops, where I laid out a good deal of money, in pre&s;ents, to both of the ladies; for I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew &s;ome more certain tokens of fondne&s;s and galantry to my lovely

<P>However, all my caution did not avail me long; for my attentions, my langui&s;hments, on one &s;ide, with &s;ome unpardonable neglects and omi&s;&s;ions, on the other, &s;oon vi&s;ibly marked the preference. The for&s;aken fair had betrayed a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s and pique, at this, once or twice before; but one night, after &s;up|per, at a tavern, when my pupil and I were ex|changing a few <HI>bons mots,</HI> in French, &s;he &s;tarted up from the table, expre&s;&s;ing her re&s;entment, in the&s;e words:</P>

<P>She was an alarming figure all together. Her eyes fla&s;hed fire, her cheeks flu&s;hed blood, her whole frame was convul&s;ed; and her charms became, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, both heightened and deformed.

<P>I Could not compo&s;e my &s;pirits &s;ufficiently, that night, to lie down in my bed, and &s;at up till day-break, mu&s;ing o'er the taper. My reflections ran thus: I was apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the violence of the di&s;appointed Divorc&eacute;e, might tran&s;port her to expo&s;e the fair victim to her hu&s;|band. I was re&s;olved to vindicate her <HI>actual in|nocence,</HI> and to &s;upport her through the con&s;e|quences of our mutual indi&s;cretion, &s;o far as it had already proceeded; and was &s;o affected with

the dangerous &s;ituation to which my libertini&s;m had reduced her, that I re&s;olutely determined never more to re-vi&s;it Leadenhall-&s;treet again; and compounded for the lo&s;s of a fond mi&s;tre&s;s, by the getting rid of a jealous virago.</P>
<P>Having thus far qualified the difficulty and unea&s;ine&s;s of my mind, I began to turn my thoughts inward on my&s;elf&mdash;What a life is mine! without purpo&s;e, or end!

<P>Then, upon comparing my Temple, with my college life&mdash;That, letters, love, and oeconomy &mdash;This, di&s;&s;ipation, debauchery, and extrava|gance&mdash;I &s;tarted from my chair, crying out, Where is &s;he, my lovely academic, now? my virtuous mi&s;tre&s;s, my di&s;intere&s;ted friend, my &s;ociety alone!

<P>MY &s;entiments, with regard to the charming <HI>Eloi&s;a,</HI> were not, at fir&s;t, &s;olely the de|ductions of rea&s;on, but rather the in&s;pirations of pa&s;&s;ion. This will &s;urpri&s;e you, perhaps. I had parted from her, with tolerable ea&s;e to my|&s;elf, becau&s;e I had the &s;atisfaction to have no manner of apprehen&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon her own account. I had left her &s;afe, both in for|tune and in virtue. So far had I acquitted my|&s;elf, to the calls of honour, and the claims of ju&s;tice; and on my own part, I had youth, fro|lic, and adventure, before me, to keep up my &s;pirits, on the parting.</P>
<P>But, I had never pa&s;&s;ed a day, &s;ince our la&s;t adieu, without wi&s;hing for her &s;ociety; nor a night, without longing for her fellow&s;hip. Wo|men and wine had lo&s;t their flavour; company became in&s;ipid, books dry, and amour wanted ze&s;t. In fine, &s;he was my health, which I had in&s;en&s;ibly enjoyed, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and only lamented, in the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>My la&s;t night's &s;hock had, like a burning-gla&s;s, collected all the&s;e &s;cattered rays of love and vir|tue together, in an in&s;tant, and their <HI>vis unita</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="189">
force was irre&s;i&s;tible. My re&s;olves are &s;udden, and my action quick. I took po&s;t-hor&s;es imme|diately, and drove down to Oxford.</P>
<P>My inquiry about <HI>her,</HI> there, was fruitle&s;s. I was informed, that <HI>he</HI> had lived intirely &s;eque&s;|tered, from the time I quitted college, appear|ing only at the public lectures, and the public &s;ervice; and that as &s;oon as he had taken his de|gree, he had &s;truck his name out of the books, and retired, whither unknown, without having taken leave of any body.</P>
<P>I lay that night in the town, and was pre|paring to pur&s;ue my dear fugitive further, the next morning, when &s;ome &s;elect friends of mine, who had become fellows of the univer&s;ity, and had been informed of my arrival, came to the inn, and arre&s;ted my cour&s;e. We loved one another, we walked together o'er the cla&s;&s;ic ground; particularly the park, where my dear chum had related to me all her tran&s;actions with her grandfather; and O! where the action with <HI>Ap Shones</HI> had happened, which was the prologue to my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>We &s;pent the day together, often &s;peaking of our <HI>pretty collegiate,</HI> as they called her, and at &s;eve|ral times I was in danger of expo&s;ing the &s;ecret, by the tran&s;ports that I found it difficult to re&s;train, upon the mention of her name. I loitered at

<P>FROM Oxford I proceeded to our former &s;ojourn, for the double plea&s;ure of em|bracing my little Hermes, and hearing, proba|bly, &s;ome account of his dear mother. But in both was I di&s;appointed. My old landlady in|formed me that about a month before, a very pretty young gentleman, who called him&s;elf my wife's brother, and was as like her as a twin, had come to his hou&s;e, brought a maid-&s;ervant in the chair with him, and carried away the child, who had been long weaned, and was a fine healthy, lovely boy.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="191">This additional circum&s;tance &s;unk my &s;pirits to the lowe&s;t ebb.

She had never mentioned him to me, by any other title than the <HI>Old Colonel,</HI> or <HI>Grand&s;ire.</HI></P>
<P>Nor indeed, had I ever a&s;ked her any thing about the matter my&s;elf, becau&s;e, from the auk|ward circum&s;tance of my own family affair, I did not chu&s;e to be communicative in the like particular, my&s;elf. Nay, the &s;ame re&s;erve I have &s;till continued to pre&s;erve, even toward you, gentlemen, &s;aid he to Mr. Andrews and Beville, for <HI>Carewe</HI> is not my real name, but only one that I have a&s;&s;umed to my&s;elf becau&s;e I did not care to u&s;e my own, while my father and I re|main upon &s;uch unhappy terms.</P>
<P>Thus was I blown out to &s;ea, again&mdash;But though I lo&s;t my <HI>haven,</HI> I was re&s;olved to take what care I could of the cargo; and for one in|&s;tance of it, I immediately wrote a letter to the gentleman with whom I happened to have the adventure at this hou&s;e, de&s;iring him to make his remittances of alimony through the hands of Mr. Seawell, for the future; telling him that
<PB N="193" REF="192">
I found it very inconvenient to act any longer as agent in that bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I did not, however, re&s;ign the office of tru&s;tee at the &s;ame time&mdash;The mo&s;t worthle&s;s per&s;on, the greate&s;t criminal, has a right to ju&s;tice from us, though not to favour; and a breach of con|fidence is &s;omething more than an offence again&s;t morals.</P>

<P>I FELT my&s;elf in the world alone. I had now no <HI>point of view</HI> to guide my <HI>per&s;pective,</HI> no referable object to direct my actions toward. The mind is active, and like a conjured demon, will ra&s;e, or build a church, according to the &s;pell that rai&s;ed it:

I returned back, forlorn, to London, to folly, intemperance, and to <HI>&s;ingle joys.</HI> However, I &s;hut my&s;elf up in my chambers, at fir&s;t, and &s;tudied law with great application, in order to
<PB N="194" REF="193">
keep my attention from wandering upon outward objects, and to attach it to &s;ome rational pur|&s;uit in life.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after I had thus &s;eque&s;tered my&s;elf from the world, I received the followed billet, one morning:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Certain friend of yours, is at pre&s;ent in a very unhappy &s;ituation&mdash;If you are a gen|tleman of honour, you will repair in&s;tantly to Leadenhall-&s;treet, and there you &s;hall hear the particulars from, dear Sir, your truly afflicted, and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Jane Seawell.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This note alarmed me. I concluded that &s;ome aukward piece of bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t have fallen out, from the jealous re&s;entment of the Divorc&eacute;e. But whatever it might be, I was re&s;olved to bear my&s;elf through it, like a man; &s;o putting on my &s;word, I took coach, and drove off directly to the rendezvous appointed.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the hou&s;e, I was led into the parlour, where I found Mr. and Mrs. Sea|well together, and alone. He was walking in a di&s;turbed manner, about the room, while &s;he &s;at weeping in the window. Ju&s;t as I gue&s;&s;ed, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, Mr. Seawell received me with

a formal and embarra&s;&s;ed air, and his wife, wiping her eyes, ro&s;e quickly from her &s;eat, and running toward me, cried out, Oh! Sir&mdash;our poor unhappy friend is <HI>lo&s;t, ruined, and undone.</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;hocked greatly, at this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, but began &s;oon to grow ea&s;ier in my mind, than I had felt my&s;elf on my entrance, and de|&s;iring to be informed of the nature and circum|&s;tances of that unfortunate lady's difficulties, Mr. Seawell gave me the following account:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="159" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. CLIX.</HEAD>
<P>A Young merchant Jew, ju&s;t entered on the <HI>'Change,</HI> having had frequent bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act at my <HI>counter,</HI> was often invited to my table, where this lady was always one of the company. She threw out her lure, and incou|raged his addre&s;&s;es, <HI>extempore.</HI> This was ob|vious enough on the fir&s;t interview; but as there <HI>may be</HI> flirts, who would not be &s;trumpets, I &s;uffered the amour to be carried on before my face, for about a fortnight; till her behaviour at la&s;t, her affecting always to &s;it by him, her lay|ing hold of his hand to fix him in di&s;cour&s;e, her fond inclinings, her gloting eyes, &amp;c. began to
<PB N="196" REF="195">
give me &s;uch offence, and alarm too, on ac|count of the example before my wife, that I marked it to both the lovers, the la&s;t night they &s;upped together here; and forbore a&s;king him farther than my <HI>counting-office,</HI> for the future, whenever his bu&s;ine&s;s gave him pretence to call upon me.</P>
<P>This difficulty embarra&s;&s;ed the <HI>inamorato's</HI> a good deal, and reduced them to the nece&s;&s;ity of making appointments el&s;ewhere. They met in the park, at the play, and other places, which are not material to the &s;tory, therefore I &s;hall now pa&s;s on to the pre&s;ent cri&s;is of this bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This morning &s;he was arre&s;ted at my hou&s;e, upon an information for having &s;tolen a diamond ring, value five hundred pounds, from the Jew. She immediately threw her&s;elf at my feet, con|tinued Mr. Seawell, &s;upplicating me not to &s;uffer her to be hurried away to a gaol, before &s;he had an opportunity of &s;peaking a word or two with the merchant, whom &s;he intreated me to go for, in per&s;on, and bring to her, on the in&s;tant. My wife joined in the reque&s;t, I prevailed on the bailiffs to wait my return, and immediately re|paired to the Jew's lodgings.</P>
<P>He told me the whole cour&s;e of the intrigue, ever &s;ince the la&s;t evening they had pa&s;&s;ed toge|ther
<PB N="197" REF="196">
at my hou&s;e, till two nights pa&s;t, when &s;he was prevailed upon to &s;up with him at his own lodgings. Here, &s;aid he, I happened to amu&s;e her by &s;hewing a parcel of valuable jewels, which had been con&s;igned to me by a corre&s;pondent at Venice, and were that evening ju&s;t come to hand.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday morning, &s;aid he, I mi&s;&s;ed the ring in que&s;tion, and wrote her a civil line, to know whether &s;he had taken it way, either in mi&s;take, or je&s;t, to alarm me? To which &s;he replied, that &s;he knew nothing at all of the matter, had not even di&s;tingui&s;hed the ring from the re&s;t of the jewels, and la&s;tly, that I was welcome to her affidavit, if I &s;hould be mean and ungene|rous enough, to charge her &s;till with &s;o ba&s;e a fraud.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wer confounded me, continued he. I could no longer &s;u&s;pect her, after this la&s;t para|graph&mdash;<HI>though &s;he is a Chri&s;tian</HI>&mdash;Such was the Jew's expre&s;&s;ion. I then looked all through my bureau again, &s;earched my rooms and my pockets, above twenty times; but in vain. By this time, &s;aid he, the day was far &s;pent, &s;o that it was late before I could go about the city, to give notice at all the jewellers &s;hops; but had the mortification to find that my warning came too late, for that the ring had been di&s;po&s;ed of
<PB N="198" REF="197">
at one of them, early in the morning, by an ordinary woman, who appeared to be a &s;ervant-maid.</P>
<P>Upon this I began to challenge the purcha&s;er, for having ventured to buy &s;uch a commodity, in &s;o clande&s;tine a manner; but he &s;topped me &s;hort, by acquainting me that, in this particular, he had conducted him&s;elf with &s;ufficient mercan|tile caution; for, upon &s;u&s;pecting the per&s;ons who had offered the ring to &s;ale, he had threat|ened to detain her till &s;he &s;hould be able to give him a &s;atisfactory account, both of her&s;elf and the jewel.</P>
<P>Upon this, &s;aid he, &s;he led me to one Mr. Seawell's hou&s;e, in Leadenhall-&s;treet, where a lady, of a very re&s;pon&s;ible appearance, who, it &s;eems, lodges there, vouched the property to be her own. Upon which I returned with the wench, back again to my &s;hop, and paid her, before witne&s;&s;es, what I hope may be deemed pretty near the value of the ring.</P>
<P>After this, continued the Jew, I thought I had no other mea&s;ure to keep, but that of ju&s;|tice. I immediately gave in examinations be|fore a magi&s;trate, and have now delivered the wretched woman over into the hands of the law, where &s;he &s;hall abide her doom, for me. I pre&s;|&s;ed him to come along with me to &s;ee her, at

lea&s;t, as &s;he had &s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, but he peremptorily refu&s;ed. For to what purpo&s;e, &s;aid he? I would not forgive the <HI>debt,</HI> even to a <HI>Jew;</HI> much le&s;s the <HI>theft,</HI> to a <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>I then returned home, concluded Mr. Sea|well, and delivered the pri&s;oner up to the bailiffs, who carried her immediately away, and lodged her in the Poultry-compter. That fooli&s;h chicken-hearted woman there, added he, fell into di&s;traction, at the merited di&s;tre&s;s of her hopeful friend, and wrote you the note which has brought you, Sir, hither, and given you a trouble that I apprehend can po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer no manner of purpo&s;e, in the world.</P>
<P>The lovely Seawell then falling on her knees before me, implored my a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward re&s;cu|ing our poor unhappy friend, from her mi&s;era|ble &s;ituation. I would &s;natch her from the ground, but &s;he was immoveable in her &s;uit. I promi&s;ed every thing in my power, &s;aid that it was not ea&s;y to frame any manner of device, on the in&s;tant, but I would fly to comfort her, and con&s;ult together all po&s;&s;ible means of &s;aving her life, at lea&s;t. Ju&s;tice forbids it, added I, but humanity intercedes, even for vice. I then rai&s;ed the &s;uppliant fair; but in the mid&s;t of my moral, found my&s;elf, e'er I was aware, pre&s;&s;ing her hand, &s;omewhat too tenderly.</P>

<P>WHEN I entered the gaol, I felt my&s;elf affected with a crowd of &s;en&s;ations and reflections; the noi&s;ome &s;cents, the &s;allow com|plexions, the &s;qualid garments, &s;hocked my &s;ight and &s;mell. But I found my&s;elf much more di&s;|turbed at the boi&s;terous merriment I heard among the pri&s;oners; which made their wretch|edne&s;s appear &s;till more wretched; and added <HI>Bedlam</HI> to the <HI>Mint.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;pied the unhappy woman &s;itting in a corner of the common hall, her face all pale with guilt and dread, her arms cro&s;&s;ed over her brea&s;t, and eyes turned up to Heaven; while a parcel of raggamuffins, male and female, were rifling her pockets for <HI>garni&s;h. The oppre&s;&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>How I felt, is not to be de&s;cribed. Her beauty, her vice&mdash;her &s;ituation, her &s;ex&mdash;That form which I had once folded in my arms, with fondne&s;s and de&s;ire! her jealou&s;y, my vanity&mdash; her di&s;tre&s;s, and my compa&s;&s;ion! I &s;cattered money among the contending mob, &s;eized her arm, and hurried her into an inner room, be|fore &s;he could perceive who I was. Then taking her gently by the hand, and beginning to
<PB N="201" REF="200">
&s;peak I know not what, my tongue &s;tood &s;till, and my eyes o'erflowed.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he ob&s;erved me, &s;he gave a loud &s;hriek, her &s;trength failed her, and &s;he &s;unk down upon the floor, murmuring to her&s;elf, <Q>This is too much, O ju&s;tice! to be con|fronted with the per&s;on who knows &s;o many vices in me! loaded as I am with guilt, this added &s;hame reaches beyond my powers!</Q> It gave me extreme &s;atisfaction to find her &s;u&s;cep|tible of any &s;park of virtue, of humility, or con|trition. I rai&s;ed her up, embraced her, bid her repent, hope, and depend upon my utmo&s;t ex|ertion in her defence.</P>
<P>She then confe&s;&s;ed the felony to me, pretend|ing that had I been con&s;tant to her, this misfor|tune could never have happened; that love alone, with me, would have &s;atisfied all her de&s;ires; but finding her&s;elf di&s;appointed in that fond wi&s;h, &s;he had re&s;olved to make all her future amours &s;ub|&s;ervient to her intere&s;t.</P>
<P>She told me that with this view, &s;he had en|gaged in an intrigue with the Jew, becau&s;e he was reckoned rich. That &s;he had endeavoured to get money from him, once or twice, on pre|tence of being con&s;iderably in debt, but &s;ound him to be a mean-&s;pirited fellow; and that &s;he was tempted to &s;lip the ring into her bo&s;om,
<PB N="202" REF="201">
in order to pay her&s;elf; imagining that perhaps he might not have readily mi&s;&s;ed it from among &s;o large a parcel of jewels; or that if he &s;hould, &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly not have been &s;u&s;pected; might wheedle him out of it; or finally, com|pound the matter with him, by re&s;toring it again. But&mdash;having once obtained the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize, &s;aid &s;he, my avarice began to lay violent hands upon it; and the temptation proved, alas! too &s;trong for my weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus, continued &s;he, did I &s;ap the founda|tions of my hone&s;ty, as I had done before of my cha&s;tity, by <HI>&s;alvo's.</HI> My <HI>fir&s;t</HI> failure&mdash;I may deem it my only one&mdash;For one breach in virtue, renders a woman bankrupt for life. Honour is our true virginity&mdash;Di&s;honour never &s;trikes us twice&mdash;My affair with the unfortunate young man that is dead, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh and a tear, was never intended, or the con&s;equences even apprehended, by me. He was forward, and took freedoms, which I permitted, rather for want of <HI>breeding,</HI> than of <HI>mode&s;ty;</HI> and I find|ing &s;till my purpo&s;e hone&s;t, indulged too great a latitude to my actions; determining however, mo&s;t re&s;olutely, to oppo&s;e the <HI>la&s;t attack.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! he had gained ground on me, &s;o gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly, that the <HI>la&s;t favour,</HI> be|ing but little more than what he had obtained
<PB N="203" REF="202">
the day before, I was ruined, e'er I perceived my danger.

<P>I Staid to dinner with her, in this wretched &s;cene, endeavouring to &s;upport her &s;pirits by frequent a&s;&s;urances of my friend&s;hip and com|pa&s;&s;ion, which I promi&s;ed to exert for her &s;er|vice, to the utmo&s;t &s;hilling of my fortune; but at the &s;ame time, &s;trongly recommending to her an unfeigned penitence, and a thorough refor|mation of life. Prepare your&s;elf for death, ad|ded I, not through de&s;pair, but by the only preparation that is fit for life. Hope, and virtue. She wept, vowed, and prayed.</P>
<P>At parting, I de&s;ired her to give me the mo|ney &s;he had received on the &s;ale of the ring, that I might carry it to the Jew, and endeavour to bribe him into a compo&s;ition of the felony, with
<PB N="204" REF="203">
it. Here &s;he fell into tears again, exclaiming out, Oh, Sir! too &s;urely is folly the natural con|comitant of vice! I thought I &s;hould have &s;creened my&s;elf, by employing another per&s;on, and one unknown, to di&s;po&s;e of the jewel; and I imagined I might have &s;afely intru&s;ted my own maid, who had lived with me &s;ince we were both of us children&mdash;but &s;he has never returned to me, &s;ince &s;he received the money.</P>
<P>No matter, I replied, the expedient I intended, &s;hall be &s;upplied out of my own pur&s;e&mdash;So pro|mi&s;ing to return the next morning, I retired, without taking any other leave of her, than by a bow, and adieu. A gaol is no &s;cene of galantry, and after my fir&s;t tran&s;port of humanity toward her, was over, I kept quite clear of all manner of dalliance, for the remainder of the day&mdash;both upon her account, and my own. Vice is con|tagious, as well as di&s;temper; and I was re|&s;olved to hold no farther connection with it, than what was barely nece&s;&s;ary for its cure.</P>
<P>However, I felt my&s;elf extremely unea&s;y at leaving the unhappy woman in &s;uch a place, and circum&s;tance, alone, and would have given bail for her my&s;elf, but I was told by the gaoler, that a <HI>po&s;itive felony</HI> would not admit it. I then gave him five guineas, to treat the lady with the ut|mo&s;t humanity and re&s;pect, had her placed in

<P>I WAS impatient, Mr. Reader, till Mr. Ca|rewe had fini&s;hed the la&s;t chapter, that I might indulge my&s;elf in the opportunity of &s;ay|ing a few words, upon a &s;ubject which he touches a little at, in the beginning of it. Namely, <HI>a gaol.</HI></P>
<P>Every per&s;on's humanity, though ever &s;o uni|ver&s;al, &s;till &s;elects to it&s;elf one favourite object of compa&s;&s;ion. Some, the lunatic&mdash;others the beggar&mdash;&s;ome, the &s;lave; and others, the cri|minal. Mine is the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea pri&s;oner.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>lunatic</HI> is a &s;ad object, indeed! Swift &s;aid that this was a &s;ight which he could never look on, without an inward &s;hock. I am, my|&s;elf&mdash;God pre&s;erve my &s;en&s;es! as much affected at this appearance, as he could be, though I have not &s;o much wit to lo&s;e&mdash;<HI>Sed mi&s;erum e&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="205">
perdere naulum</HI>&mdash;But then, this is con&s;idering the madman as an <HI>object,</HI> merely&mdash;for, as a <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> he is frequently an happy creature&mdash;and fools bid faire&s;t for that character!</P>
<P>The <HI>mendicant</HI> enjoys freedom, air, and cha|rity&mdash;<HI>Turki&s;h captives,</HI> or <HI>galley-&s;laves,</HI> have exer|ci&s;e, and its <HI>&s;weet lacquey,</HI> re&s;t. And even the&s;e, or <HI>mine,</HI> or <HI>row,</HI> in hopes of redemption&mdash; For &s;uch is the mi&s;taken charity of Chri&s;tians, that they often pa&s;s by the moans of <HI>Southwark,</HI> and the <HI>Fleet,</HI> to &s;et &s;laves free in Barbary! The Culprit! why he is not a pri&s;oner <HI>for life</HI>&mdash;but <HI>for death,</HI> only. His confinement is but &s;hort&mdash; <HI>Aut cita mors, aut victoria laeta!</HI></P>
<P>The confined <HI>debtor</HI> is a wretch, who vexed with all their griefs, has not a &s;ingle &s;olace of their reliefs. He has the <HI>Bedlamite</HI>'s re&s;traint, without the ignorance of his mi&s;ery! he is a beggar, without freedom, air, or charity! a &s;lave, without the whole&s;ome vici&s;&s;itudes of la|bour and re&s;t! a pri&s;oner, without the <HI>permu|tatio foelix,</HI> of death or liberty! The criminal may have &s;ome hope, from the favour of a jury, or the mercy of a judge&mdash;but the har&s;h creditor is, at once, both judge, jury, and executioner too, to the extreme&s;t letter of the law. The <HI>Jew of Venice</HI> was tender-hearted&mdash;he would have a pound of fle&s;h only, and let the re&s;t go free&mdash;

the <HI>Chri&s;tian gaoler</HI> &s;keletons the whole body with pining want, manacles the limbs to noi|&s;ome dungeons, and wa&s;tes the mind in repi|nings and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>I &s;peak not here, of common ca&s;es, for I tru&s;t in my <HI>Redeemer,</HI> that there are but few like this; for many debtors have &s;ub&s;tance, and <HI>&s;ome creditors</HI> want not humanity&mdash;but I &s;peak only of tho&s;e wretches, who <HI>cannot pay,</HI> and tho&s;e greater ones, who <HI>cannot forgive</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Matthew, chap. xviii. beginning at ver&s;e 21.</NOTE>.

<P>The legi&s;lature would certainly interpo&s;e, in &s;uch hard ca&s;es as the&s;e, but upon the pre&s;ump|tion that no <HI>human creature</HI> can be totally devoid of <HI>humanity.</HI> The bankruptcy act does not reach it.

<P>A &s;tanding act, of this kind, comprehending every per&s;on, and at all times, who was willing to take the relief of it, would be nece&s;&s;ary to abrogate this <HI>&s;ummum jus,</HI> this <HI>tyranny within</HI> the

<P>AS &s;oon as I returned home, &s;aid Mr. Ca|rewe, I &s;ent a note to my good old friend Domino, addre&s;&s;ed for him at the compting-hou&s;e, where he had directed me to pay the intere&s;t of my bonds, as it &s;hould become due; begging the favour of him to let me have five hundred pounds, if po&s;&s;ible, the next morning, upon a very pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>He came to me the next day, before ten o'clock, and brought the money along with him, telling me, while he was filling up the bond, that this was the la&s;t &s;hilling he had, at pre&s;ent, or might perhaps, for ever have it in his power to lend. No matter for that, replied I, &s;o far as relates to my&s;elf, for I have had a &s;ufficient &s;urfeit of extravagance already, and I promi&s;e you, that as &s;oon as I &s;hall have got rid
<PB N="209" REF="208">
of a certain difficult bu&s;ine&s;s, which I am ju&s;t now engaged in, I will retire from the world, to books, and oeconomy, till love and matri|mony, which I am now in que&s;t of, added I, with a &s;igh, &s;hall engro&s;s me &s;ole. Little Do|mino much commended both of the&s;e prudent and virtuous re&s;olutions, and took his leave.</P>
<P>I flew immediately to Leadenhall-&s;treet, to reque&s;t the favour of Mr. Seawell to carry this five hundred pounds to his friend the Jew, and tempt him to withdraw the pro&s;ecution; as I thought that a collu&s;ion of this kind, might be more &s;ucce&s;sfully managed in privacy between them&s;elves, than by the negotiation of any third per&s;on. It was with great difficulty I could pre|vail on him to tran&s;act this affair, but by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his wife's tears and intreaties, we at length got him out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Seawell remained in the parlour with me, till her hu&s;band's return, expre&s;&s;ing great apprehen&s;ions and concern for her friend, one minute, and begging of me, the next, to tell her the whole &s;tory of our amour, for that &s;he loved to hear <HI>little novels,</HI> va&s;tly. I defended my&s;elf, by replying that the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion was too &s;erious a time, to amu&s;e with &s;uch light tales as this, while the life of the unhappy &s;ub|ject of it, remained &s;till under &s;u&s;pence; and
<PB N="210" REF="209">
that memoirs, of the kind &s;he &s;eemed to ima|gine ours to have been, were very improper and dangerous recitals for wives to li&s;ten to.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, how you talk, now! replied &s;he, how differently from what you u&s;ed to do! but the extremity of your grief for the <HI>fair</HI> pri|&s;oner&mdash;though &s;he is much fallen off, in my opinion, in that particular, of late&mdash;has, I be|lieve, made a &s;waddler of you. Prithee now, could your telling an arch &s;tory of our friend, among our&s;elves here, have any manner of effect upon her tryal? And for my own part, I really cannot &s;ee why any wife in the world might not read an intrigue this hour, and &s;ay her prayers the next. Nay, the warmer perhaps, for that rea&s;on, as it might afford her a hint to pray more earne&s;tly again&s;t the temptation&mdash;I hope this la&s;t reflection, Mr. Methodi&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;mile, will plea&s;e you.</P>
<P>I laughed at her giddy liveline&s;s, but mu&s;t confe&s;s that I was once or twice, very near for|getting my&s;elf, on this <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> party. Her morning <HI>de&s;habille</HI> had &s;omething extremely ele|gant and familiar in it; her robe was loo&s;e, and made of a French lute&s;tring, azure ground, clouded with pale pink: &s;he had no &s;tays on, but a fine ticken ve&s;t, which &s;uffered all the pliancies of an ea&s;y, well-turned &s;hape, to appear through
<PB N="211" REF="210">
it. Her bright glo&s;&s;y hair, which had a natural curl in it, flowed carele&s;sly over her &s;houlders, and was interwoven before, with ribbon, like a victim dre&s;&s;ed for the &s;acrifice. The few drops of pity &s;he had ju&s;t &s;hed, added another <HI>water</HI> to the brilliancy of her eyes. Her neck was un|covered, excepting a &s;light black gauze handker|chief, which was cro&s;&s;ed before, and folded in between her brea&s;ts, to mark the parted &s;now. She appeared to be finely limbed, her &s;lippers were of light blue Per&s;ian, with a &s;ilver fringe, her &s;tockings white &s;ilk, and her petticoats &s;o &s;hort, that the ta&s;&s;els of her garters were to be &s;een, as &s;he &s;at leaning on the couch with one leg hanging over the cu&s;hion, and the other reaching to the floor.</P>
<P>Her <HI>toute en&s;emble</HI> was &s;o very alluring, that a more perfect &s;aint than I was, might perhaps have fallen into the temptation; but virtue had for me, the counter-charms of a <HI>new mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> I reflected on the late danger to which &s;he had her|&s;elf been expo&s;ed, from the rival&s;hip of the Di|vorc&eacute;e; I ruminated upon the depth of vice which the other had fallen into, from perfect innocence, through one unguarded &s;tep&mdash;and could I think of expo&s;ing her to the &s;ame &s;in! The place too, warned my virtue&mdash;Scipio, a Pagan, forewent the rights of conque&s;t, from a
<PB N="212" REF="211">
principle of honour, alone&mdash;and &s;hould I, a Chri&s;tian, dare profane the &s;acred laws of ho&s;pi|tality! But more, in aid, to my exalted &s;en&s;e appeared the lovely academic, like an angel heavenly bright! &s;he firmed my foot&s;teps, like <HI>a fixed point of view,</HI> which guides the equilibri&s;t &s;afely o'er the precipice, upon a &s;ingle plank.</P>
<P>I pre&s;erved the &s;pirit of the&s;e reflections, through my whole conver&s;ation with her; &s;often|ing however, the au&s;terity of them, with a guarded mixture of gaiety and politene&s;s; and endeavoured to recommend virtue, as libertines do vice, by &s;etting forth the plea&s;ures of it, till Mr. Seawell returned to us, with an account of his having happily concluded a treaty with the Jew; who had been prevailed upon to accept the money, and engaged not to appear upon the tryal.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>I WAS tran&s;ported at this event, and &s;o ap|peared the lovely Seawell too, at the fir&s;t&mdash; But&mdash;female friend&s;hip! her joy began to flatten; which upon perceiving, I took notice of to her. She replied, that it really did afford her great plea|&s;ure, to find that the <HI>poor woman</HI>'s life was &s;afe, but feared, at the &s;ame time, for her <HI>wretched &s;oul</HI>'s &s;ake, that &s;he would never die &s;o well pre|pared, as &s;he had a chance of doing upon this <HI>lucky warning.</HI> To which &s;he added, that &s;he apprehended &s;till farther, <HI>upon my account,</HI> le&s;t her beauty&mdash;<HI>what remained of it</HI>&mdash;her <HI>wickedne&s;s and arts,</HI> might hereafter lead me into &s;ome more expen&s;ive or dangerous mi&s;hap, than I had hi|therto &s;u&s;tained from her.</P>
<P>I returned her thanks for her friendly concern about me, but a&s;&s;ured her that all &s;uch fears for me, were groundle&s;s; for that vice, or even beauty, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ail my heart in vain, who&s;e af|fections were already fixed upon an adamantine rock, of love, and virtue. And that be&s;ides, with regard to the lady in que&s;tion, I was re&s;ol|ved, as &s;oon as the tryal &s;hould be over, to make u&s;e of all my influence to per&s;uade her to quit
<PB N="214" REF="213">
the kingdom immediately, and leave her &s;hame behind her. She &s;eemed to rejoice both in my &s;ecurity, and in my &s;cheme, and immediately of|fered to accompany me to the gaol, to carry the happy news to her <HI>dear friend.</HI></P>
<P>I declined going my&s;elf, at that time, &s;aying that I &s;hould not chu&s;e to &s;ee the unhappy wo|man, till after her fir&s;t emotions were over; and that the acknowledgements her gratitude might prompt her to make, would render me aukward and unea&s;y; but &s;aid, that I &s;hould be much plea&s;ed, if &s;he would carry the good news her|&s;elf, and prepare her to receive me, agreeably to my own &s;entiments of this matter. That if &s;he would &s;tay to dinner there, I would remain with Mr Seawell till evening, and by the time that I might imagine the lady's &s;pirits to be a little compo&s;ed, he and I &s;hould wait upon them to &s;upper. Her hu&s;band con&s;ented to this propo&s;al, and &s;he went off directly in a chair.</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e, in thus putting my&s;elf upon Mr. Seawell, was with a de&s;ign of cultivating an intimacy and friend&s;hip with him, in order to &s;trengthen my virtue, by an alliance with my honour. I had a farther view al&s;o, of becoming a watchful guardian over his wife's behaviour; as the galantries I had practi&s;ed toward her, hav|ing &s;eemed to have had &s;ome little effect upon
<PB N="215" REF="214">
her mind, rendered me an&s;werable for her future conduct.</P>

<P>I Spent the remainder of the day plea&s;antly enough, with Mr. Seawell, and a very &s;en|&s;ible, good &s;ort of elderly country gentleman, who was his near relation, and happened to dine with us. Our ho&s;t was a plain, rational man, without either wit or learning; but one who appeared to know the world &s;ufficiently, and to under&s;tand mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s extremely well. I was with him for &s;ome time in his compting-hou&s;e, before dinner; and after he had fini&s;hed his letters for the po&s;t, and that his friend had taken his leave, we took coach, and went to wait upon our ladies together.</P>
<P>We found them both very properly employed; the pri&s;oner was reading one of the volumes of Sherlock, while Mrs. Seawell was attending, and &s;prigging a flower in the border of an hand|kerchief. The fair Confined, upon &s;eeing me enter the room, fell on her knees; I ran to take her up, and vowed I would quit the place
<PB N="216" REF="215">

<P>She ro&s;e immediately, and a&s;ked my pardon, for having forgot the <HI>generous injunction,</HI> as &s;he termed it, which I had &s;ent her by Mrs. Seawell; adding, that it was increa&s;ing the obligation to do &s;o, as it mu&s;t have been impo&s;&s;ible for her to have found words &s;trong enough to expre&s;s the grateful &s;entiments &s;he bore toward her kind deliverer.</P>

<P>I Pa&s;&s;ed great part of every day, during her confinement, with the fair reformed; and in reality, &s;he appeared to be a truly penitent one. I acted as her <HI>ordinary,</HI> and was highly &s;en&s;ible of the tran&s;cendent joy of <HI>mini&s;tering to a mind di&s;ea&s;ed.</HI> I u&s;ed to carry a variety of books in my pocket, and read &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages out of them, to her, fitted to alleviate her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he would throw her&s;elf on her knees, and pray; at others, in a female expre&s;|&s;ion of gratitude, catch me in her arms, and weep. Then, with joined hands, and uplifted eyes, walk acro&s;s the room, crying out, <Q>How happy was it for me to have felt this &s;evere, yet healing affliction! Had not Divine Pro|vidence, in its great mercy, thus awakened my &s;oul to attention, I might have &s;till gone on, from bad to wor&s;e, to wor&s;t. Is there in &s;en&s;uality an age of joy, equal in poignancy, or degree, to one hour of that horror and anxiety I have endured, &s;ince my committal hither! and yet, the&s;e terrors are what even the mo&s;t fortunate &s;inners mu&s;t &s;oon, or late,
<PB N="219" REF="218">
&s;u&s;tain; for though they &s;hould e&s;cape <HI>a &s;caf|fold, a death-bed has no reprieve!</HI></Q></P>
<P>At other moments, &s;he would &s;tart up from her &s;eat, with wildne&s;s and de&s;pair in her looks, crying, <Q>Where is my hu&s;band! where my children! where is that generous hand, which rai&s;ed me from indigence to affluence! and where tho&s;e lovely babes, that doubly ble&s;&s;ed my fortunes! you have&mdash;you have, &s;he would add, &s;uborned the evidence again&s;t my life&mdash; but oh! who &s;hall bribe off the&s;e bitter te&s;ti|monies again&s;t my &s;oul!</Q></P>
<P>Such &s;ad reflections, and &s;elf-expo&s;tulations as the&s;e, u&s;ed to throw her into &s;woonings almo&s;t to convul&s;ions, which I endeavoured to relieve, in vain, till after a &s;hower of contrite tears, had a&s;&s;waged the tempe&s;t in her brea&s;t, and recovered her, but rather to a torpid, than a calm &s;tate of mind.</P>
<P>I became quite charmed with my fair peni|tent. She &s;eemed &s;ometimes in&s;pired. She talked above her rea&s;on, and often exerted an energy, beyond her native force. I contributed every argument in my power, to &s;trengthen and confirm the&s;e good &s;entiments in her. She only wrought her&s;elf into the&s;e exta&s;ies, when we were alone together, but &s;he diffu&s;ed the &s;pirit of them, through all her conver&s;e with Mrs. Sea|well,
<PB N="220" REF="219">
who always &s;pent every evening with her; and thus helped to &s;econd the fair intentions, which I had before conceived, toward that very pretty, but very weak young woman.</P>
<P>On the po&s;t-evenings, Mr. Seawell never paid us a vi&s;it, and I u&s;ed to walk home with my fair pupil, to Leadenhall-&s;treet, and deliver up my charge, at the door. She told me, one night, as I was conducting her, with a <HI>no-thanks</HI> to me, that the Divorc&eacute;e had related her whole &s;tory to her, at &s;ome interval &s;he happened to be with her alone, not by way of <HI>narrative,</HI> but <HI>confe&s;&s;ion;</HI> and gave me &s;uch warning, and coun|&s;el, upon &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of it, &s;aid &s;he, that I hope, and believe I &s;hall be the better for, all my life.</P>
<P>At another time, &s;he &s;aid that &s;he really ima|gined our friend to be perfectly &s;incere in her reformation; which had rendered her a truly edifying example&mdash;And yours al&s;o, &s;aid &s;he, turning to me, greatly confirms the &s;trength of it; for it proves that virtue may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, even in the mid&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion. To tell you the truth, went &s;he on, what had put me almo&s;t out of conceit with goodne&s;s, before&mdash;I mean, &s;aid &s;he, catching her&s;elf up, the <HI>appearances</HI> of it, was that one &s;eldom &s;ees it preached, or practi&s;ed, but by certain old folk, who &s;eem to grow
<PB N="221" REF="220">
good, merely when they are become <HI>good for nothing;</HI> and poorly think to heal example, by precept.</P>
<P>I agreed with my fair morali&s;t, that this was too generally the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially with women; who once entered into vice, rarely quit the <HI>&s;in,</HI> till the <HI>&s;inner</HI> for&s;akes them. And as their affections, being naturally &s;trong, mu&s;t be occupied, and their fond hearts engaged, they then become de|vot&eacute;es, and enter into a cour&s;e of Platonics with Heaven. The object only changed, the pa&s;&s;ion &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, then, replied &s;he, we had better remain as we are, for women, it &s;eems, are &s;candalous, in &s;in, and become ridiculous, when they would put on the appearances of growing good again. Your &s;cheme, &s;aid I, is certainly the be&s;t; for 'tis the ea&s;ie&s;t, the &s;afe&s;t, and upon experience, will be found to be the plea&s;ante&s;t, al&s;o.</P>

<P>AT length, the irk&s;ome day of tryal arrived; a cri&s;is, which even to the innocent, or the &s;ecure, mu&s;t occa&s;ion great matter of pertur|bation. My penitent did not appear to be the lea&s;t di&s;turbed at its approach. She a&s;&s;ured me that virtue and religion had, even within &s;o &s;hort an interval, &s;o perfectly calmed every pa&s;|&s;ion in her mind, that &s;he was very certain, had not the pro&s;ecution been purcha&s;ed off, I &s;hould have &s;een her upon this occa&s;ion, rather more compo&s;ed than &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he was at the pre|&s;ent; for &s;he owned that there lay one concern heavy on her mind, now, which &s;he would not much have attended to, then. This was her being expo&s;ed a public &s;pectacle in a court, upon an indictment for &s;o mean a crime.</P>
<P>This thought plea&s;ed me extremely. It gave me a&s;&s;urance of her virtue. Mode&s;ty is the great bulwark of that &s;ex; and the &s;ure&s;t &s;ign of a re|turning grace in them, is its being accompanied with a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. I was re&s;olved therefore, to extricate her from this difficulty; and imme|diately calling in the gaoler, I told him how the ca&s;e &s;tood, with regard to his pri&s;oner; that
<PB N="223" REF="222">
there was to be no manner of pro&s;ecution; and therefore, as there was nothing more than mere matter of form to pa&s;s through, I would give him ten guineas to procure any ordinary woman to &s;tand in the dock, and hold up her hand at the bar, in this lady's name.</P>
<P>The money tempted him, he &s;tept out of the room, and returning back again in about five minutes, told us he had bribed his own maid-&s;ervant, to put on her riding-hood, and act the culprit part for the pri&s;oner. But at the &s;ame time, he in&s;i&s;ted upon locking the lady up &s;afe, le&s;t the pro&s;ecution might unexpectedly go on, and he be obliged then, to plead a mi&s;take, and produce the real per&s;on, who&s;e name was upon his calendar.</P>
<P>We &s;ubmitted to this caution; and I con|&s;ented, at her reque&s;t, to be confined along with her; having retained &s;ome eminent lawyers to attend the tryal, and placed Mr. Seawell as a guard upon the Jew. When we were left alone, tears bur&s;t from her eyes, and turning them to me, You cannot bear acknowledgements, &s;aid &s;he, therefore I &s;hall only &s;till continue to oblige, by a&s;king further favours from you. Will you then, in this &s;ad &s;cene, and at this dread hour, join your voice with mine, in fervent prayer? I kneeled down by her, at the word, and we
<PB N="224" REF="223">
both continued in that po&s;ture, till we heard the door unlocked; when Mr. Seawell came running into the room, to wi&s;h her joy.</P>
<P>She behaved with her <HI>new temper,</HI> upon this occa&s;ion; and with a compo&s;ed countenance, and &s;teady voice, replied, I heartily thank my friends, both for their kindne&s;s and generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance, during my di&s;tre&s;s, but O! far above all do I acknowledge my eternal obligations to the <HI>Mo&s;t Highe&s;t,</HI> for his infinite goodne&s;s and mercy, in having thus tried and proved me, by this <HI>happy affliction.</HI></P>
<P>We immediately took coach, and went off together to Leadenhall-&s;treet, where we found Mrs. Seawell in the fonde&s;t anxiety and impa|tience, as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, to receive her dear friend &s;afe into her arms; and both &s;he and I had already &s;et forth the reformation of the Divorc&eacute;e, in &s;uch a light, that Mr. Seawell was prevailed upon, at my reque&s;t, to accept of her as a lodger in his hou&s;e again.</P>
<P>I &s;taid to dine with them; in the evening the two ladies went to prayers, and at their return, I read Amana to them, a new dramatic poem, which had been ju&s;t publi&s;hed that day. They appeared to be both charmed with the &s;pirit, &s;tyle, and &s;entiments of the writing, and &s;aid
<PB N="225" REF="224">
they were flattered by it al&s;o, as it was written by a woman.</P>
<P>We &s;upped together; and when I was taking my leave, I paid the reclaimed Divorc&eacute;e all due compliments, upon her proper &s;en&s;e and merit on the late occa&s;ion; and concluded with this injunction to the re&s;t, that on account of this con&s;ideration, no part of her pa&s;t conduct, or private hi&s;tory, &s;hould ever be repeated out of our little &s;ociety, nor even remembered in it. The Seawells made a &s;olemn vow of confidence, to the purport of my propo&s;ition, and I retired, leaving the retrieved fair di&s;&s;olved in tears of tendere&s;t gratitude.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. CLXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Returned home with the mo&s;t exulting heart imaginable. I had re&s;cued one woman, and prevented another, from ruin. So far well&mdash;for them. But, for my&s;elf, I had another woman, more precious than the whole &s;ex be&s;ides, &s;till to recover. This acqui&s;ition was nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="226" REF="225">
confirm my virtue, and compleat my happine&s;s at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But, where to find her&mdash;by what clue to trace her out! London was neither a probable place to expect, nor a po&s;&s;ible one to &s;earch for her in; and to what part of England &s;he might have re|tired, with her little <HI>Hermes,</HI> then about three years old, it mu&s;t have been impo&s;&s;ible for me, even to have gue&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next morning, I &s;ent a card to Leaden|hall-&s;treet, to inquire how the ladies did, but did not pay them a vi&s;it for &s;everal days, which I pa&s;&s;ed retired in my chambers, in a very low-&s;pirited way, ari&s;ing from the de&s;pondent reflec|tion ju&s;t mentioned; praying and hoping that either her friend&s;hip for me, or natural curio&s;ity at lea&s;t, to know what &s;cheme, or cour&s;e of life, I was pur&s;uing, or &s;ome lucky accident or other, might re&s;tore me to the happine&s;s of &s;eeing her once more; and re&s;olving, upon a tru&s;t in this fond hope, to hold both my heart and hand at liberty to dedicate to her.</P>
<P>The la&s;t evening of my retirement, Mr. Sea|well called to &s;ee me. He told me that his la|dies had gone to morning and evening prayers, at &s;ix and &s;ix, every day &s;ince we parted; and that his wife had objected to the early &s;ervice, at fir&s;t, but had been per&s;uaded to it by her friend,
<PB N="227" REF="226">
as an&s;wering a double purpo&s;e at once, both of health and devotion. He added that he owed great obligations to this extraordinary woman, who kept his wife almo&s;t con&s;tantly in her com|pany, read to her, and endeavoured all in her power, to improve her mind, and regulate her conduct.</P>
<P>He concluded his vi&s;it, with telling me that the ladies were much &s;urpri&s;ed at my long ab|&s;ence, and had &s;ent him to inquire whether any accident, or di&s;gu&s;t, had happened to deprive them the plea&s;ure of my company. I returned my compliments to the fair queri&s;ts, and a&s;&s;ured him that I had purpo&s;ed to wait upon upon them the next morning, before he had called upon me.</P>

<P>THE day following, I went to Leadenhall-&s;treet, about twelve o'clock; and after a few minutes conver&s;ation with Mr. and Mrs. Seawell, below &s;tairs, I walked up to pay a vi&s;it to my now e&s;teemed friend; who received me
<PB N="228" REF="227">
with great chearfulne&s;s in her manner, and plea|&s;ure in her looks.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked me, in a friendly way, why I had ab&s;ented my&s;elf &s;o long, from friends who had &s;o well-grounded an e&s;teem for me? But I re|collect your delicacy, &s;aid &s;he, you were afraid of acknowledgements, and knowing the world tolerably well, might very ju&s;tly have concluded that a few days interval would have &s;upplied a bumper of <HI>Leth&eacute;</HI> to obligation. No, Mr. Ca|rewe, added &s;he, though my &s;peech may be condemned to &s;ilence, my actions &s;hall ever bear an higher te&s;timony of my gratitude toward you.</P>
<P>I hope, continued &s;he, with a &s;mile, that my behaviour for &s;ome time pa&s;t, may not be under|&s;tood as any contradiction to my pre&s;ent pro|fe&s;&s;ions; but the innocent, yet frail Mrs. Sea|well, has candidly confe&s;&s;ed her weakne&s;s, with regard to you; &s;he has tran&s;lated to me all your French conver&s;ations together, and has owned the dangerous preference, which it was too na|tural for a young galant to have obtained over an old hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But my exhortations, my remon&s;trances, &s;aid &s;he, with the prevalence of my own &s;ad exam|ple, who with&mdash;I may without pre&s;umption add &mdash;better &s;en&s;e, and le&s;s temptation to err, had
<PB N="229" REF="228">
merely through indi&s;cretion, been led from one &s;tep to another, into the very gulph of de&s;truc|tion, have been &s;o &s;trongly urged by me, as a warning to her conduct, that I think I may, as far as female &s;incerity can be depended upon, give a&s;&s;urance of her conduct for the future.</P>
<P>To this I replied, in the &s;ame &s;tyle with which &s;he had acco&s;ted me, that &s;he had infringed one article of her covenant, for &s;o far from re&s;training her &s;peech, &s;he had te&s;tified her obli|gations to me in the highe&s;t manner, in thus employing it to co-operate by her advice and coun&s;el, with my own hone&s;t intentions toward the per&s;on &s;he mentioned. And if the lady has done me ju&s;tice, added I, you mu&s;t be already convinced of this a&s;&s;ertion, from my conver&s;a|tion and manners with regard to her, for &s;ome time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;he replied, that my friend has not made me a confidant, in this particular, you are not to expect &s;uch ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in our &s;ex &mdash;and to tell you the truth, &s;aid &s;he, I think it would not be prudent in either of us, to take any notice of it to her. Women are naturally weak, and vain; and 'tis the be&s;t philo&s;ophy always to oppo&s;e the&s;e foibles again&s;t each other. Now &s;hould her virtue appear to have ari&s;en from any other principle but her own native force, believe
<PB N="230" REF="229">
me it would much weaken the incitement to it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant the door opened, and a lovely boy of about eight years of age, walked into the room&mdash;&s;he looked, &s;he doubted&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed, &s;he &s;tarted&mdash;then giving a loud &s;hriek, &s;prang forward, caught him up in her arms, and would have &s;tifled him with her embrace, if a mo&s;t beautiful girl, about a year younger, had not appeared immediately after&mdash;&s;he let her &s;on drop, and had not power to advance toward her daughter&mdash;but when her hu&s;band entered the room, &s;he &s;wooned away on the floor, before he could run up to &s;u&s;tain her.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was beyond my powers&mdash;I ran in|&s;tantly down &s;tairs, to rejoice with my friends below, upon this happy event, which I had al|ready prepared them for.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="170" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD>CHAP. CLXX.</HEAD>
<P>YOU were kinder to them, than you have been to us, interrupted Mr. Andrews and Beville, with one voice, for this was indeed a cri&s;is, which no part of your recital could in any manner have warned us of. I was &s;o impatient to obtain this favourite point, replied Mr. Ca|rewe, that I neglected the u&s;ual cour&s;e of narra|tive, to arrive at it. The &s;tory, in &s;hort, is this:</P>
<P>When I perceived the fair Penitent ri&s;ing into virtue, by &s;uch degrees as gave a&s;&s;urance of &s;ta|bility; her repentance; her re&s;ignation; her grateful &s;entiments of her obligations to her hu&s;|band; her reflection about her children; her &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; and finally, the receiving, and rejoicing in her affliction, as a mercy and a ble&s;&s;ing from the hands of Providence; I thought her now become a fit object for the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting connections of life, either as a friend, a mother, or a wife.</P>
<P>Upon this <HI>not unphilo&s;ophic</HI> &s;entiment, I wrote a letter to her hu&s;band, the very night of her ac|quittal, &s;aying that I had &s;omething to commu|nicate to him, of con&s;equence to his children
<PB N="232" REF="231">
and him&s;elf, and reque&s;ting the favour of him to bring them up to London immediately, for that I &s;hould not explain my&s;elf any farther, by letter. Curio&s;ity hurried him up expre&s;s, and the morn|ing before I carried him to Leadenhall-&s;treet, he came to my apartments in the Temple.</P>
<P>I then told him that the bu&s;ine&s;s I had &s;um|moned him about, was to acquaint him with an event, which mu&s;t naturally afford the extreme&s;t &s;atisfaction, to an humane mind; namely, the mo&s;t compleat reformation in his wife, both in mind and manners, that ever <HI>Grace</HI> had yet vouch&s;afed to a &s;inner.</P>
<P>I then gave him an account of her behaviour and expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ince her arre&s;t, as far as I could do &s;o without revealing any part of her &s;tory, which would have been to her di&s;advan|tage; but affected to &s;peak of her amendment, as commencing immediately, upon the &s;epara|tion.</P>
<P>I &s;aid that her actions and conduct had now cea&s;ed to be a &s;candal to her hu&s;band, or a re|proach to her children; and that her &s;en&s;e and virtue were &s;ufficient to recommend her, at pre|&s;ent, both as a companion to the one, and a guide to the other. For my part, &s;aid I, were &s;he free, and my own heart di&s;ingaged, from the thorough conviction I have conceived of her
<PB N="233" REF="232">
firmne&s;s in morals and religion, I &s;hould not have the lea&s;t manner of &s;cruple about accepting her my&s;elf, into the nice&s;t and mo&s;t honourable connections of life; regarding her former vice and errors, be they what they may, but as the &s;pots of pe&s;tilence, or deliriums of a fever, un|imputable now to her re&s;tored health and rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid I, taking hold of him by the hand, whom Heaven hath forgiven, let not man for|&s;ake! receive her, dear Sir, again into your fa|vour and protection, at once to reward and to confirm her virtue; and be a&s;&s;ured that you will find the exerci&s;e of this kindne&s;s, this charity, this humanity, mo&s;t extremely plea&s;ing on the experiment, for perhaps, there may be few things, more grateful to a generous mind, than to have <HI>&s;omething to forgive.</HI></P>
<P>I perceived the workings of his mind ri&s;ing by degrees, and aiding my purpo&s;e, &s;till as I went on, but when I came to this la&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion, he bur&s;t &s;ilence with the&s;e words: "For|give!" &s;aid he, and leaning his hand upon my &s;houlder, "I have, alas! nothing to for|give! my crime has been greater than her's, even &s;uppo&s;ing her to have been guilty; and we have nothing now to do, but to commute forgivene&s;s. And as I hope that my contri|tion
<PB N="234" REF="233">
has already earned full pardon for my &s;in, we meet now upon equal terms of peni|tence&mdash;why not then, of love? O! lead me to her, thou excellent young man, that I may &s;hew the &s;trength of that pa&s;&s;ion, with which I fir&s;t embraced her, by its &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;till in force, after a &s;eparation of three years, and one &s;o &s;trongly marked as ours."</P>
<P>I li&s;tened with plea&s;ure, and embraced him with tran&s;port&mdash;I then appointed the next morn|ing for the completion of their re-union; and told him that I would not &s;uffer her to receive the lea&s;t notice of her approaching happine&s;s, in order to have their meeting as &s;trongly marked, as was their parting.</P>

<P>I SAT below with Mrs. Seawell, who was prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing me for my goodne&s;s, till dinner was &s;erved; when I went up &s;tairs to &s;ummon this little happy united family. I embraced them all, not without tears; and taking her by the hand, led her down into the parlour.</P>

<P>HAVING now rid my mind of all diffi|culties with regard to others, my own unea&s;ine&s;s pre&s;&s;ed more heavily upon me. I owed a treble obligation, to honour, to virtue, and to love; but was deprived of the charming means of acquitting my&s;elf to them all, at once. Reflection upon this &s;cheme the more confirmed my purpo&s;e; and di&s;appointment augmented &s;till my ardour.</P>
<P>I helped to relieve my &s;pirits, by reading, and &s;eeing the fair Seawell often, at her own hou&s;e, or by invitation with her hu&s;band, at my cham|bers; and our behaviour toward each other, was ever perfectly polite, and platonic. We u&s;ed all the freedom of a brother and &s;i&s;ter toge|ther, pre&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, the pure&s;t innocence of &s;uch correlatives.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation had I continued for &s;ome time, when one evening I received this letter by the penny-po&s;t, gentlemen, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, taking out his pocket-book, and pre&s;enting them with a paper to read, the contents of which were in the following words:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="237" REF="236">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you may be deemed, in &s;ome &s;ort, ac|countable for my conduct in life, perhaps it may pa&s;s for a kind of duty in me, to acquaint you with every particular of it, &s;ince we la&s;t parted; a faithful relation of which, &s;hall be the &s;ubject of this letter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had taken my degree at Oxford, I &s;truck my name out of the books, and re|turned home to my grandfather's. He was re|joiced to &s;ee me, &s;aid a great many fond and flattering things to me, and pre&s;&s;ed me &s;everal times in his arms. I felt my&s;elf extremely un|happy, on this interview, as his kindne&s;&s;es ap|peared &s;o much unmerited, on my part; fir&s;t, from the equivocation of my &s;ex; and next, from that <HI>ultimate misfortune,</HI> which had rendered me &s;o very unworthy of my real one.</P>
<P>He told me that he hoped I had come home, with a re&s;olution of remaining with him during the &s;hort remnant of his life; and I had indeed really purpo&s;ed to do &s;o. But I &s;oon found it very di&s;agreeable, and &s;ometimes inconvenient to my&s;elf, to live intirely in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was too fond of my company, and never afforded me the lea&s;t opportunity for reading, or reflection, except the few hours which I u&s;ed to
<PB N="238" REF="237">
&s;teal to my&s;elf in the mornings, by ri&s;ing &s;o much earlier than he; and during the &s;hort <HI>&s;ie&s;to's,</HI> or evening naps he took every day, after dinner.</P>
<P>I loved him for his good-nature, I re&s;pected him for his virtues, and I honoured him as a parent&mdash;but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e regards, his conver&s;ation &s;oon became tedious to me. He would tell old &s;tories, and his memory, or fre&s;h topics failing him, would repeat them over again. He would al&s;o tire me with a&s;king a number of frivolous que&s;tions, which one mo|ment's reflection might have either an&s;wered to him&s;elf, or &s;hewn him the in&s;ignificancy of. But this is after the manner of old people, who find it ea&s;ier to <HI>talk,</HI> than <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>There were &s;ome other particulars, which rendered my abode with him difficult and unea&s;y to me. He lived ho&s;pitably, and &s;aw more com|pany than was agreeable, either to my inclina|tions, or circum&s;tances. He would be &s;ome|times peevi&s;h, if I did not drink <HI>a bottle with my friends</HI>&mdash;who cared not whether I was drunk, or &s;ick with it, or no&mdash;and that I would not <HI>di&s;ho|nour</HI> my&s;elf, to do the <HI>honours</HI> of his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When young ladies happened to be of the company, he would di&s;tre&s;s me greatly, by pre&s;|&s;ing me to exert my galantries toward them. I
<PB N="239" REF="238">
u&s;ed &s;ometimes to attempt it, in complai&s;ance to him, but my addre&s;s was always too much em|barra&s;&s;ed. I could neither a&s;&s;ume the a&s;&s;urance of my apparent character, nor dive&s;t my&s;elf of the ba&s;hfulne&s;s of my real one; and this auk|wardne&s;s appeared &s;o very ridiculous, that it has frequently &s;et the girls a laughing at me.</P>
<P>But there was one difficulty, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me more than any of the re&s;t. When his hou&s;e was crouded with gue&s;ts at nights, he would de|&s;ire me to offer <HI>&s;hare of my bed,</HI> to &s;ome of the jolly fox-hunters of the company. The fir&s;t time that this happened, I feigned a &s;udden ill|ne&s;s, as &s;oon as the old colonel had retired; and &s;at up, taking an emetic, till the <HI>early horn</HI> &s;ounded, which &s;ummoned my chum to the chace, and left me the bed to my&s;elf. A &s;econd time, upon fore&s;eeing the like circum&s;tance, I pretended a va&s;t impatience of paying my duty to my aunt, and accordingly ordered the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and drove off to her hou&s;e, immediately after dinner.</P>
<P>Upon a con&s;ideration of all the&s;e circum&s;tances, I re&s;olved to retreat &s;ome-where or other, where I might pa&s;s my life in a manner more retired and agreeable, to my&s;elf, and to my real character. I told the good old man that I required the con|ver&s;ation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome eminent divines,
<PB N="240" REF="239">
to &s;ettle my <HI>orthodoxy;</HI> that I had a mind to &s;ee a little more of the world, before I &s;eque&s;tered my&s;elf from it; and that therefore I &s;hould be infinitely obliged to him, if he would let me have the portion he had been &s;o good as to al|lot me, and &s;uffer me to &s;eek my fortunes in the world, at large.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t excellent parent received my pro|po&s;al with regret; but after &s;ome pau&s;e, Thou ha&s;t &s;o much &s;en&s;e and virtue, he was &s;o kind to &s;ay, that I do not think I &s;hall fail in the duty of a guardian, in tru&s;ting you with your own con|duct in life. And as to the portion you have cho&s;en to &s;tint your&s;elf to&mdash;remember it was all your own doing&mdash;I think, d'ye mind, that you have been too fair a purcha&s;er, to have that little <HI>modicum</HI> with-held from you, upon demand &mdash;&s;o God ble&s;s you, boy&mdash;you'll come, d'ye hear, and &s;ee your old father, often. God Almighty guide and protect my child!</P>
<P>The next morning he gave me an order on his banker for four thou&s;and pounds, and open|ing his bureau, made me a pre&s;ent of two hun|dred guineas, al&s;o. We both of us wept &s;in|cerely, and the next day I borrowed his equipage, to &s;et me down in London. I placed the four thou&s;and pounds, along with the &s;ame &s;um, which you had been &s;o generous as to re|mit to me at Oxford, in the funds. I hired a
<PB N="241" REF="240">
&s;mall hou&s;e there, and &s;ent for my nur&s;e and fo&s;ter-father to come up, and attend me in it.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for &s;electing the&s;e two per&s;ons, was, that as &s;he was the only confidant of my meta|morpho&s;e, from whom I apprehended any di&s;|covery, I thought it prudent to retain her, both in my friend&s;hip, and my &s;ervice; and, as her hu&s;band was a very rational di&s;creet man, who had been my father's pari&s;h-clerk, had kept a Latin &s;chool in the village, was a good Chri&s;tian, and tolerably well read in morality and hi&s;tory, I thought he might be u&s;eful toward a&s;&s;i&s;ting me in the fir&s;t parts of my dear child's education; whom, at the proper age for beginning in&s;truc|tion, I have &s;ince brought home to me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here a&s;k pardon of you, for this theft; but fearing le&s;t you might not have had the genero&s;ity to be&s;tow him to me, had I made the reque&s;t; and being likewi&s;e offended, at the apprehen&s;ion of his ever coming to di&s;cover what kind of relation&s;hip he bears to you, I ventured to &s;teal him from you. Be&s;ides, what is, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> my &s;ole happine&s;s, might have been, perhaps, rather an incumbrance to you. He is lovely, lively, healthy, and intelligent. I will be re&s;pon&s;ible for his education and morals.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for chu&s;ing London, as an <HI>a&s;ylum</HI> from the world, was, that I thought I might
<PB N="242" REF="241">
live there more di&s;ingaged and unknown, than I could po&s;&s;ibly have done in any village or coun|try-&s;eat in England. One is be&s;t hid in a croud. Another inducement to this choice, was that I might &s;ometimes enjoy the plea&s;ure, though an unea&s;y one, of &s;eeing you, at a di&s;tance, of at|tending to your conduct, of watching over you, like a guardian-angel, un&s;een, and of doing you, perhaps, &s;ome little friendly offices, which your too giddy and di&s;&s;ipated life might po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ooner or later, afford me an opportunity of ex|erting towards you.</P>
<P>I have &s;een you often at church, and at the play; and having directed &s;ome private inqui|ries about your conduct, character, and manner of life, I was informed that you had prepared a mo&s;t expen&s;ive habit, to appear in at the fir&s;t ma&s;querade of la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, which dre&s;s I received a particular de&s;cription of.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with the whim of &s;eeing you and this fanta&s;tic &s;cene, together. I went there, dre&s;&s;ed in a <HI>domino.</HI> The re&s;t of that night's ad|venture, perhaps, may occur to your own re|collection, now. I employed my fo&s;ter-father to carry on the ma&s;querade with you the next morning, and twice &s;ince, by per&s;onating a mer|chant's clerk.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="242">I had determined to have remained in London, quite di&s;ingaged from any manner of connec|tion, &s;uffering our dear &s;on to pa&s;s for my ward, till he &s;hould be fit to enter into college, when I purpo&s;ed to carry him to Cambridge, and re&s;ide with him there. But &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which you happened to let drop, the la&s;t morning my agent was with you, have quite altered my &s;cheme of life. You hinted, with a fond &s;igh, that you were then in pur&s;uit of <HI>love and matri|mony.</HI> May all the &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s, <HI>that your merit &s;hall intitle you to,</HI> attend you in every ingagement and connection of life! To wi&s;h more were impious&mdash;</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;incerity of this prayer, notwith&s;tanding the religion, the phi|lo&s;ophy, and the re&s;ignation, with which I flattered my&s;elf that I had &s;ufficiently armed my mind, I find I cannot&mdash;I confe&s;s my weakne&s;s&mdash; think of remaining in the &s;ame city, or even in the &s;ame kingdom, with you, after &s;uch an event. Some unlucky chance might po&s;&s;ibly, hereafter, occa&s;ion you and I to meet&mdash;and I would &s;pare us both the difficulty and di&s;turbance of &s;uch an interview.</P>
<P>I deferred &s;ending you this letter, which has been written for &s;ome time, till I was on &s;hip|board,

<P>WHAT mu&s;t have been my &s;ituation, when I had come to the conclu&s;ion of this letter! what a fate had befallen me, that tho&s;e very expre&s;&s;ions of love and honour, which the overflowings of my fond heart had occa&s;ionally poured out toward her&s;elf, &s;hould have been the &s;ole cau&s;e of her being bani&s;hed from my hopes for ever! I began to grow &s;u|per&s;titious, and dread le&s;t &s;ome evil contingency might po&s;&s;ibly have been interwoven with my de&s;tiny, and fell into a kind of de&s;pondency and de&s;pair, which I continued under for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>At length I was rou&s;ed out of my reverie, by Mr. Seawell's calling on me one morning, and &s;hewing me an invitation to &s;pend &s;ome days in the country, which had been addre&s;&s;ed to him, his wife, and to me, from the gentleman, men|tioned
<PB N="245" REF="244">
before, with whom I had dined one day, in Leadenhall-&s;treet, and who lived about five miles from London.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of May, and the weather fine. I thought that company and country air might a&s;&s;i&s;t me to relieve my &s;pirits, and at lea&s;t alleviate, in &s;ome &s;ort, my pre&s;ent di&s;|appointment. I accordingly accepted of the invitation, and the next morning took a coach, called on my two friends, and drove down to the country, with a de&s;ign of &s;pending a week there together.</P>
<P>Our ho&s;t entertained us with great chearful|ne&s;s and ho&s;pitality; but finding that wine rather depre&s;&s;ed, than rai&s;ed my &s;pirits, I retired to the ladies, &s;oon after dinner&mdash;I drank a di&s;h of cof|fee with them, and perceiving that my melan|choly damped the &s;pirit of their conver&s;ation, I &s;tole out of the room, and went to &s;aunter in the gardens alone.</P>
<P>I had walked there about half an hour, when cro&s;&s;ing one of the alleys, I met Mrs. Seawell, who told me &s;he had made &s;ome pretence to quit her company, and had followed me into the garden out of a friendly curio&s;ity and con|cern, to inquire what &s;udden or extraordinary misfortune had affected me &s;o very remarkably,
<PB N="246" REF="245">
the whole day, both in looks, appetite, and manners?</P>
<P>When the mind is full, and the heart &s;of|tened, &s;ollicitation and &s;ympathy are apt to in|duce a confidence. 'Tis a relief be&s;ides, to the o'er-burdened &s;oul, to find a friendly prop to re&s;t its load upon; and in love peculiarly, it is &s;ome &s;olace, even to make the object of our affections, a &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation. I treated her then, to the <HI>little novel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See her own expre&s;&s;ion, chap. clxiii. parag. 4.</NOTE> of my amour; but with &s;uch re&s;erve, as &s;till pre&s;erved both the lady's character, and &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I told her that I had formerly paid my ad|dre&s;&s;es to a very amiable young lady, without any de&s;ign but general galantry; that I had hap|pened unluckily, to have won her heart, before I perceived that I had lo&s;t my own. That after I had parted from her, and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome dangerous and extravagant &s;cenes of idle and debauched life, I found that my attachments had been already fixed upon this dear object, without my own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the matter. That upon this conviction, I had gone to &s;earch for her, at her former re&s;idence; and upon mi&s;|&s;ing, and not being able to gather any account of her, or her family, there, I had been in que&s;t of her ever &s;ince, in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="246">I then concluded my &s;tory, with telling her that about a week pa&s;t, I had received a letter from this lady, dated from on &s;hip-board, and taking leave of me, for life. I added al&s;o, the circum&s;tance which had, through mi&s;take, been the unlucky occa&s;ion of our ultimate &s;eparation. I &s;topt, I &s;ighed, and &s;hed a tear&mdash;&s;he took me by the hand, pre&s;&s;ed it, and dropt a tear al&s;o. Through all her features was &s;trongly marked the charming <HI>morbidezza,</HI> or tender langui&s;h. She wi&s;hed her&s;elf the happy fair; or that for|tune might throw it in her way to di&s;cover, and pre&s;ent her to my arms.</P>

<P>THIS conver&s;ation had led us a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, when hap|pening to pa&s;s by an <HI>apiary,</HI> ju&s;t as one of the hives began to &s;warm, &s;he &s;tarted at the hum, and &s;prang over a border, into the oppo&s;ite al|ley. But on her alighting at the other &s;ide, &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed her footing, and fell quite pro&s;trate on the gra&s;s-walk; doing her&s;elf, at the &s;ame
<PB N="248" REF="247">
time, an accidental piece of ju&s;tice, by reveal|ing the mo&s;t beautiful limbs, even above her garters, that I had ever yet beheld.</P>
<P>I <HI>walked</HI> over the border, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; plea&s;ed, though &s;urpri&s;ed, at her remaining mo|tionle&s;s on the ground, in &s;uch a po&s;ture, and <HI>de&s;habille,</HI> as if waiting till I &s;hould come to rai&s;e her up; but it &s;eemed that &s;he had &s;prained her left ancle, and wrenched both her wri&s;ts, which had rendered her quite unable to &s;tir, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I took her in my arms, and carried her out of the &s;un, into a little green arbour that I &s;pied at &s;ome paces off, where I &s;et her down on the gra&s;s, as there was neither chair, or bench, in the place. She moaned greatly, through pain, and both her hands being di&s;abled, &s;he could not rub, or foment her leg her&s;elf; but perceiving the ancle beginning to &s;well, I kneeled down before her, and performed that piece of &s;urgery for her, as we were too far from the hou&s;e, to provide her with more decent a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I kept down the &s;welling, and by degrees &s;he found her&s;elf able to move her ancle &s;ufficiently to limp home. She then returned me thanks for my obliging care, expre&s;&s;ed great concern at the trouble &s;he had given me, and &s;eemed ex|tremely
<PB N="249" REF="248">
impatient to be gone from that &s;u&s;picious place.</P>
<P>I gave her my hand to rai&s;e her; but when &s;he attempted to &s;tir, &s;he was obliged to &s;cream out, from an exce&s;s of &s;udden pain, and remained &s;till on the ground. This &s;econd di&s;tre&s;s pro+ceeded intirely from her over-&s;crupulous mo|de&s;ty; for, that &s;he might expo&s;e no more of her leg than was ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be chafed, &s;he had contracted the &s;inews of it &s;o much, that it occa&s;ioned a violent cramp in the calf of that limb.</P>
<P>I had now an higher operation to perform, upon my too lovely patient. I began in&s;tantly to rub the <HI>ga&s;terocnemium</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A term in anatomy, for the calf of the leg.</NOTE>, till the convul&s;ion, ri&s;ing by degrees into the <HI>biceps femoris</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A mu&s;cle of the thigh, which &s;erves to move the leg,</NOTE>, and the <HI>gemini</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Harris's Lexicon Technicum.</NOTE>, I was tempted to pur&s;ue the retreat|ing enemy too far, till at length, I had fallen my &s;elf into the ambu&s;h. &mdash;</P>

<P>POOR Carewe! you &s;ee, ladies, that he cannot peep his no&s;e abroad, but tempta|tion and opportunity &s;tare him full in the face. But in truth, he had for &s;ome time, mo&s;t unphy|&s;ically mi&s;taken an ague for virtue, and the hot fit had now, very naturally &s;ucceeded the cold one. Con&s;ider his &s;ituation.

<P>The unfortunate Seawell too! her accident &s;eems to have been intirely owing to her total ignorance in <HI>natural philo&s;ophy.</HI> Familiarity with men, though upon the cha&s;te&s;t principles ima|ginable, is always dangerous.

<P>In &s;hort, take my word for it, ladies, tho&s;e few of you who have had no experience in this

matter, that Platonics are a mere farce. 'Tis as dull and unintere&s;ting, as <HI>hunting a drag,</HI> with|out any <HI>quarry</HI> at the end of it. They are the devil's features, under an angel's ma&s;k. In ge|neral, they are but pretended, in order to in|dulge a vice, under the cloak of virtue; but even where they are &s;incere, as in innocent and unexperienced minds they &s;ometimes may be, yet let &s;uch &s;till beware, that refined pa&s;&s;ions, like dried gunpowder, are thereby but rendered the more &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;park; and whether the flame be caught from an earthly fire, or a coe|le&s;tial ray, it equally rai&s;es the combu&s;tible to an explo&s;ion.</P>
<P>There happened to be another &s;cience too, which the fair, but illiterate Seawell &s;eems to have been totally ignorant of, upon this cri&s;is; namely, <HI>anatomy.</HI> Mr. Carewe appears to be perfectly &s;killed in the mu&s;cles <HI>ga&s;terocnemium,</HI> the <HI>biceps femoris,</HI> and the O <HI>gemini!</HI> but the poor lady had unfortunately, never learned the u&s;e of the <HI>tendon,</HI> &s;tiled <HI>Sartorius</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is called in anatomy, the <HI>Taylor's Mu&s;cle,</HI> as it is that which enables us to <HI>cro&s;s our legs.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>I pur&s;ued her into the garden, and &s;oon over|took her labouring toward the hou&s;e, in pain and di&s;traction. I took hold of her hand, threw my&s;elf at her feet, implored her forgivene&s;s, pleaded &s;urpri&s;e, pa&s;&s;ion, madne&s;s, nature, &amp;c. She &s;till continued to weep, and remained &s;ome time &s;ilent while I was &s;upporting her under the arm, till I led her near the hou&s;e, when &s;he made u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion: <Q>I neither blame you, Sir, nor my&s;elf, &s;aid &s;he, but wi&s;h &s;in|cerely, that my death, this morning, had been as &s;udden, and unexpected, as <HI>your</HI> crime.</Q></P>
<P>The accident of her fall, the marks of which became now very vi&s;ible in her leg and wri&s;ts, accounted for her confu&s;ion and tears, and my walking off abruptly, as I did, to London, as &s;oon as I had &s;eated Mrs. Seawell in the drawing-room, was apologized for, by her telling the company the &s;tory I had made her a confidant of, in the garden; and which al&s;o made an excu&s;e for my gloomy re&s;erve, and avoidance of &s;ociety, all the day.</P>
<P>I did indeed fly precipitately from the hou&s;e, the moment I had di&s;ingaged my&s;elf, being a&s;hamed to look <HI>&s;ome of the company</HI> in the face,

and afraid al&s;o of embarra&s;&s;ing the unfortu|nate fair one, with my pre&s;ence.

<P>I Remained at home, for about a week, &s;pend|ing my time between mu&s;ings and books; often ki&s;&s;ing and reading over my dear Domino's letter, till I am very certain that I could repeat every &s;yllable of it by heart. I found that I owed her eight thou&s;and pounds; which though an heavy debt, gave me this &s;atisfaction, that by this means I might po&s;&s;ibly have the happine&s;s of &s;oon finding her out; for as it was the whole of her fortune, &s;he mu&s;t be obliged to draw bills upon me for the intere&s;t; and I was in hopes that I &s;hould then be able to di&s;cover the place of her re&s;idence, from the date of her fir&s;t <HI>ad|vice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="254">I thought it prudent, during this avocation and lei&s;ure, to look a little into my own affairs, and make &s;ome calculation about my other debts and expences; and upon this inquiry had the &s;urpri&s;e to find, that be&s;ides this eight thou&s;and pounds, I owed in &s;undry &s;ums, each of which was too &s;mall in it&s;elf to alarm me, to the amount of two thou&s;and pounds, more.</P>
<P>Thus had I the &s;hame and mortification of reflecting that almo&s;t half my fortune had been the prey of vanity and extravagance, without having purcha&s;ed me any one re&s;pon&s;ible plea|&s;ure, even a tran&s;itory one, except the five hun|dred pounds which I had be&s;towed upon the Divorc&eacute;e, and which will ever remain a &s;olid and permanent one, to me. For all the joys I had ever yet experienced, had been contingen|cies merely, without having been either my purcha&s;e, or pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The cheape&s;t thing a man can po&s;&s;ibly do, is to pay his debts; and 'tis cheaper &s;till to &s;ell, than borrow. I applied immediately to a <HI>land-jobber,</HI> for this purpo&s;e, and marked out a di&s;|tinct portion of my e&s;tate to him, which I was re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;e of. We &s;oon agreed upon the terms, but when he came to look into the title, I was di&s;covered to have been made but
<PB N="256" REF="255">
bare <HI>tenant for life,</HI> with remainder over, to &s;ome di&s;tant relation of the te&s;tator.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t knowledge I ever had re|ceived, of the re&s;triction which my fortune was tied down to. My honour was extremely &s;hocked, upon this information, on account of the danger to which my unfortunate creditors, but principally my dear <HI>wife and child,</HI> were ex|po&s;ed, upon the precariou&s;ne&s;s of my life.</P>
<P>I held a frequent corre&s;pondence with my dear mother, during her life, and had &s;everal inter|views with her, by her appointments, at a rela|tion's hou&s;e of her's, about a day's journey from my father's&mdash;From her I learned that he was, at this time, but ju&s;t entering into his fiftieth year, and was of a robu&s;t, hale, fox-hunter's con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, I thought it would be extremely idle in me, to live on upon contin|gency, and very di&s;hone&s;t too, to refer my cre|ditors to &s;o in&s;ufficient a &s;ecurity. I therefore, for the &s;afety of all parties, immediately re&s;olved upon a &s;cheme of oeconomy, which I accord|ingly put in practice the very next day.</P>
<P>I found that though I had been made <HI>tenant for life,</HI> by the will, yet I was left <HI>di&s;puni&s;hable for wa&s;te,</HI> &s;o I di&s;po&s;ed of my woods, to a per|&s;on who had been in treaty with me for them,
<PB N="257" REF="256">
upon my adverti&s;ement, for the &s;um of five thou|&s;and pounds. I might perhaps have rai&s;ed more money, upon this &s;ale, had I given notice of it in the public papers; but I tran&s;acted the mat|ter clande&s;tinely, as it were, le&s;t it might po&s;&s;ibly have come to the knowledge of my dear wife, and have given her an alarm, with regard to her own fortune, or rendered her generous mind unea&s;y, about mine.</P>
<P>I laid out this money in the funds, with a re&s;olution to confine my expences to the income of it. I al&s;o ve&s;ted the rents of my e&s;tate, in the hands of a tru&s;tee, a bencher of the Inner Temple, and a friend of mine; giving him a &s;chedule of my debts, directing principally, that the intere&s;t of the eight thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be kept &s;acred, again&s;t all half-yearly demands, and three thou&s;and pounds of the principal pro|vided for likewi&s;e, out of the fir&s;t receipts, the wood-money being depo&s;ited as a &s;ecurity for the remainder; and that the re&s;t of my creditors &s;hould be paid off in cour&s;e, with a preference &s;till, in favour of the mo&s;t needy.</P>

<P>ONE morning, about a fortnight after my adventure in the arbour, as I was reading in my chambers, Mr. Seawell came into the room, after a very abrupt manner, &s;hut the door ha&s;tily, and turning the bolt of the lock, <Q>You'll excu&s;e my manners, Sir, &s;aid he, but my bu&s;ine&s;s with you, at pre&s;ent, requires privacy.</Q></P>
<P>He appeared to be much di&s;turbed, and you mu&s;t imagine, gentlemen, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, that I could not have been perfectly at ea&s;e my|&s;elf, upon this extraordinary interview. O what a powerful thing is guilt! That &s;pirit of youth and nature, which but a minute before dared have braved a lion, now trembled at a man.</P>
<P>This affair, my dear Andrews, &s;aid he, had like to have ended very fatally, both to you and me, for it was that very five hundred pounds, which the unfortunate man's difficulties then called upon me to join him in a bond for, that &s;ome time after involved your genero&s;ity, in &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s and danger. But this relief happened not to be at all effectual to the poor man, for his di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es in trade, fell &s;o
<PB N="259" REF="258">
quick upon him, that he was obliged to quit the kingdom &s;oon after, and ab&s;conded with his wife, into Holland.</P>
<P>When the hone&s;t man found that he could not &s;tand his ground, he &s;ent me private notice to lay on an execution, in order to &s;ecure my|&s;elf in a debt which he had contracted &s;olely with a view of pre&s;erving his credit, on the <HI>'Change.</HI> I did as he directed, and received the five hundred pounds, upon the &s;ale of his ef|fects.</P>
<P>The next day I paid a vi&s;it to the Jew mer|chant, already &s;poken of, and depo&s;ited this &s;um in his hands, with directions to remit it over to his friend in Holland, as a &s;upport to the&s;e poor unhappy fugitives. He executed this commi&s;|&s;ion with punctuality, and I had the &s;atisfaction, &s;ome time after, to hear that by this help, joined to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Dutch merchants, who had been his corre&s;pondents at London, he had been enabled to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf very comforta|bly in trade again, at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>This debt, now becoming my own, I imme|diately added to the &s;chedule which I had al|ready given in to my tru&s;tee.</P>

<P>HAVING now prudently contracted my expences to the bare intere&s;t of five thou|&s;and pounds, I thought it proper to quit the Temple, and retire from among a &s;ett of cotem|poraries, with whom I had been u&s;ed to &s;pend a much larger income.</P>
<P>I took lodgings at a milliner's, a widow, in London, and kept my&s;elf pretty much retired there, &s;eldom &s;tirring abroad, except to &s;up, now and then, with my friend and tru&s;tee; or &s;ome|times &s;pending a night or two with him, at a little <HI>villa</HI> he had near town.</P>
<P>Some evenings when I happened to be tired of reading, or not in a fit di&s;po&s;ition of mind to &s;it down to it, I would invite my landlady and her daughter up &s;tairs, to drink tea, or &s;up with me. The mother u&s;ed to entertain me with mi&s;taking one word for another that had a &s;imilar &s;ound, and would really have been a trea&s;ure to <HI>Fielding,</HI> when he was drawing the character of his <HI>Slip-Slop.</HI></P>
<P>Her daughter was young, hand&s;ome, and for|ward. The mother would frequently leave us together, when &s;he was called down &s;tairs, about
<PB N="261" REF="260">
the bu&s;ine&s;s of her &s;hop. The&s;e are hazardous experiments. I had before experienced male cha&s;tity to be a je&s;t, and am apt to believe too, that opportunity is generally an over-match for female virtue, al&s;o. <HI>The Parthian exerci&s;e is their be&s;t di&s;cipline</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An happy expre&s;&s;ion made u&s;e of by the lady who tran&s;lated the memoirs and writings of Ninon de l'Enclos.</NOTE>. This adventure &s;oon added ano|ther five hundred pounds, to my <HI>&s;chedule.</HI></P>
<P>A batchelor's life, who has any principles of honour, is a very aukward and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing one. I have often wi&s;hed that philo&s;ophy could point out &s;ome way or other, to reconcile morals with nature, and &s;trike every thing out of the cata|logue of vices, which is not entered in the li&s;t of rea&s;on. I would marry, but could not. The per&s;on upon whom my virtue and affections had been fixed, was &s;natched from my arms; and while even the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of recovering her, remained, it would have been di&s;honourable in me to have entered into engagements, with any other woman. <HI>Quoi faire, donc?</HI></P>
<P>It was here I lodged, my dear Andrews, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, when your bravery and genero&s;ity re&s;cued me on Ludgate-hill; and from the day of our parting at I&s;lington, I retired into the country of England, without remaining long in
<PB N="262" REF="261">
any one place, in order to avoid fixing my af|fections on any woman, who might, during the uncertain and fluctuating &s;tate of my mind, have po&s;&s;ibly attached them too much, either for my honour, or repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The interval of my life, between that day and this, continued Mr. Carewe, has been chiefly employed in reading, or amu&s;ed with a very few de&s;ultory adventures, without connection, or con&s;equence, and therefore not worth relating; excepting one, which being equally whim&s;ical and ridiculous, I &s;hall entertain you with, at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>IN one of the villages where I lodged, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, I happened to become ac|quainted with a gentleman in the neighbourhood, by his dining &s;ometimes with my landlord, with whom I boarded. He had great fund of enter|tainment in him, not indeed derived from any extraordinary &s;en&s;e, wit, or learning; but he was an <HI>humouri&s;t,</HI> had a peculiar ca&s;t of charac|ter, and was what the French &s;tile <HI>un di&s;eur des bons mots,</HI> but &s;ea&s;oned high with &s;arca&s;m, which rendered him, at once, the delight, and terror, of all his acquaintance; for he was very free of &s;peech, and his de&s;criptions of the principal per|&s;onages,
<PB N="267" REF="266">
male and female, of that country, which he u&s;ually made the topics of his conver|&s;ation, were doubly pointed, both critical and &s;evere.</P>
<P>One evening he invited me, along with a good deal of company, to &s;upper at his hou&s;e. His wife was a pretty kind of woman, hand&s;ome, lively, good-humoured, and about thirty years of age. He was him&s;elf an hale man, &s;omewhat above forty. They had been ju&s;t &s;even years married, that day, without ever having had a child; or the lea&s;t alarm about one.</P>
<P>We &s;pent the night very chearfully and agree|ably together, &s;ome in dancing, and others in playing cards, till &s;upper was &s;erved; which was a very elegant one, in honour, as he told us, of his wedding-day. About twelve o'clock, the company divided, the ladies retired up-&s;tairs, with his wife, and the men &s;taid below with our landlord, to fini&s;h what wine was upon the ta|ble, and to e&s;cort the ladies home.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour, a bell was rung, and our ho&s;t immediately ri&s;ing up from his chair, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, ye were mo&s;t of you pre&s;ent, this very night &s;even years, at the ceremony of <HI>throwing the &s;tocking,</HI> and I have in|vited you all, this evening, in order to be &s;pecta|tors of a rite, which I de&s;ign to introduce, of
<PB N="268" REF="267">
<HI>ca&s;ting the night-cap.</HI> We &s;miled at the expre&s;&s;ion, though without thoroughly comprehending the meaning of it, and followed him up &s;tairs into his wife's apartment.</P>
<P>We found her in bed, with the re&s;t of the ladies &s;tanding round it. As &s;oon as her hu&s;|band entered the room, he took up his night-cap, which had been placed upon his own pil|low, and with an audible voice, repeated the following lines:
<Q><L>Vainly I've in the vineyard plied,</L>
<L>Seven years of fruitle&s;s love have tried,</L>
<L>An hard apprentice&s;hip, alack!</L>
<L>When e'er 'tis &s;erved the trade grows &s;lack!</L>
<L>With equal wi&s;h tho' toiled my dame,</L>
<L><HI>Love's labour lo&s;t</HI> was all our game.</L>
<L>What folly 'twere then, to repeat it,</L>
<L>So thus I <HI>ca&s;t my night-cap</HI> at it.</L></Q></P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed his rhimes, he rai&s;ed up the cloaths with one hand, and with the other &s;lung his brown beaver into the middle of the bed. The whole company laughed heartily, and &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with the humour. For my part, I confe&s;s that I could not much reli&s;h the indecency of the action, in it&s;elf, though his being a &s;ort of privileged per&s;on, and this frolick
<PB N="269" REF="268">
a &s;troke in character, did in &s;ome mea&s;ure, take off a good deal from the impropriety of it.</P>
<P>When I was taking my leave, I &s;tooped down, and &s;aluted the fair pro&s;trate; then turning about to the hu&s;band, <Q>I&s;&s;ue, Sir, &s;aid I, is more the gift of Providence, than of nature; and tho&s;e from whom this ble&s;&s;ing is with-held, would do well to think that in the di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven, &s;ome parents may be left without children, becau&s;e &s;ome children are left de&s;|titute of parents.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eemed to be &s;truck with my expre&s;&s;ion. Your hint &s;hall not be thrown away upon me, replied he. We &s;hook hands, and parted. In a few days after, I had the plea&s;ure to hear that he had adopted two orphans in the pari&s;h, a boy and a girl, whom he cloathed, and put to &s;chool, with a declared, and provided purpo&s;e, of apprenticing and portioning them, here|after.</P>

<P>THIS Mr. Carewe &s;eems really to be a mo&s;t excellent young man. You'll pardon him, ladies, the few &s;nacks of wenching he takes, now and then, as you &s;ee that this is not his purpo&s;e, and that he would do better, if he could. His &s;entiment in this place, is extremely beautiful. The reflection is fine, and the thought intirely new. But in truth, it were a &s;hame if a Chri&s;tian had not been able to have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, when a Pa|gan, Epictetus, was capable of &s;aying, that <HI>there were no orphans, for Jupiter, the parent of mankind, liveth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could per&s;uade your <HI>old maids</HI> to pick up a little moral, out of this &s;entiment of Mr. Carewe: It would be much better for their poor &s;ouls, than <HI>peevi&s;hne&s;s, envy, and &s;candal.</HI> It might po&s;&s;ibly, al&s;o recommend them &s;ometimes to widowers; and after they were pa&s;t the hopes of being ever made <HI>mothers,</HI> them&s;elves, give them a chance of becoming <HI>&s;tep-mothers</HI> to others, at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>And in towns, I would have one, two, or or three women, pa&s;t their teemings, e&s;tabli&s;hed in every pari&s;h, according to the &s;ize of it, who &s;hould be ready to be &s;ummoned, in aid, to pre|vent hu&s;bands from <HI>gandering</HI> away their health, and &s;quandering their &s;ub&s;tance, when wives lie in; and when they die, to take upon them the go|vernment of the hou&s;e and family, in order to keep widowers from injuring their children, by &s;econd marriages.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>&s;uccedaneums</HI> to matrimony, &s;hould be always lodged at the apothecary's, ready to be <HI>admini&s;tered,</HI> as occa&s;ion may require; and ought to be &s;upported by a pari&s;h ce&s;s, to be levied along with the poor-hou&s;e rates, and watch-money. And with regard to the moral of the matter, in polity, as well as war, may it not be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to appoint <HI>des enfans perdu&euml;s,</HI> or a <HI>forlorn-hope,</HI> to be &s;acrificed, for the good of the community?</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="271">I think proper, in this place, to explain and vindicate my&s;elf, upon a pa&s;&s;age, in my &s;ub|&s;cription-li&s;t, where I make a di&s;tinction between <HI>old maids</HI> and <HI>old virgins,</HI> which it &s;eems, has given great offence to a very re&s;pectable &s;ociety, as I have been informed by a letter I received lately, from a lady who &s;tiles her&s;elf <HI>pre&s;ident</HI> to an academy of old maidens, in the city; and who concludes her epi&s;tle in the&s;e words: <Q>'Tis very hard truly, Sir, that you will not allow us even <HI>the virtue of nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> nor leave us the <HI>merit</HI> of cha&s;tity, to make us &s;ome &s;mall amends, for the <HI>mortification</HI> of it.</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e ladies have mi&s;apprehended me greatly, if they imagine that I meant to ca&s;t any manner of reflection upon their purity, by this di&s;tinction&mdash;far from it: but my philo&s;ophy about the matter, is really this: Let maidens guard their virginity, ever &s;o vigilantly, from man, that &s;ly, &s;low ravi&s;her, which be&s;ieges them, both night and day, <HI>time</HI> will, at length, &s;teal it imperceptibly away, in de&s;pite of cha&s;tity, even while they are at their <HI>la&s;t prayers,</HI> or wrangling at quadrille.</P>
<P>For virginity, like other flowers, though you &s;hould not pluck it, falls off it&s;elf, when ripe, leaving a dry and &s;terile &s;talk behind it. Milton &s;ays,
<Q><PB N="273" REF="272">It withers on the &s;talk, with langui&s;h'd head;</Q>
And Shake&s;pear,
<Q><L>But earthlier happier is the ro&s;e di&s;tilled,</L>
<L>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn,</L>
<L>Grows, lives, and dies, in &s;ingle ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</L></Q>
So that <HI>old maids,</HI> be they never &s;o cha&s;te, can|not, with any manner of propriety, be &s;tiled <HI>virgins</HI>&mdash;but the <HI>haums</HI> of virginity, only.</P>
<P>Old maids and batchelors may be compared to <HI>ram-pikes,</HI> which remain &s;olitary in the wood|land, after their fellows have been made into uten&s;ils for the u&s;e and &s;ervices of &s;ociety.</P>

<P>I Pa&s;&s;ed the tedious interval &s;ince our parting, in this &s;ort of vagrant life, in the country of England, except &s;everal half-yearly excur&s;ions, which I took to France, Italy, Germany, and Holland, in pur&s;uit of my dear Domino, upon receiving her bills from any of tho&s;e places.
<PB N="274" REF="273">
But all my &s;earch was vain, for it &s;eems &s;he had provided her&s;elf with a letter of credit, upon go|ing abroad, by depo&s;iting my bonds in the hands of her banker, which enabled her to re|ceive value for her bill, at the time of &s;igning it. However, &s;he never did this, till &s;he was ju&s;t &s;etting out upon her purpo&s;ed tour; and I found it impo&s;&s;ible to trace her cour&s;e by any inquiries I could make at her banker's, or even at her lodgings, which I had &s;ometimes hit upon.</P>
<P>About a month ago, I was &s;ummoned up to London, upon the death of my worthy friend and tru&s;tee, in order to &s;ettle accounts with his executor, and to transfer the tru&s;t. Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed this bu&s;ine&s;s, I received a foreign letter, directed to my former apartments at the Temple.</P>
<P>I knew the hand, ki&s;&s;ed it, and trembled. But when I turned it about to tear open the &s;eal, finding the wax black, and the edges of the pa|per mourning, my heart gave one loud throb, and cea&s;ed all motion. My &s;tomach grew in|&s;tantly &s;ick, and my voice was ju&s;t able to falter out, <HI>My Hermes is no more.</HI></P>
<P>In this opinion I was but too much confirmed, after I had had re&s;olution enough to open the letter, by &s;eeing, at the top of it, an order to her banker, to cancel my fir&s;t bond of four thou|&s;and
<PB N="275" REF="274">
pounds, which was the very provi&s;ion I had allotted as a portion for my dear child.</P>
<P>The letter dropt from my hands, and I walked about the room, for &s;ome time, before I had power to take it up again. For to the lo&s;s of my &s;on, upon who&s;e honours was built my whole ambition, was added the de&s;pair of ever recovering his dear mother again; all tender, all natural, all virtuous connection, thus at once cut off!</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe then pre&s;ented the letter to Mr. Andrews, who read as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of returning you the por|tion you had conferred upon our dear Hermes, as he has now no longer any occa&s;ion for your maintenance, and that perhaps it may, at pre&s;ent, be nece&s;&s;ary to your own.</P>
<P>My life has been pur&s;ued by lo&s;&s;es and misfor|tunes, &s;ince I left England. La&s;t year, my dear grandfather died, of the gout in his &s;tomach; and about a month ago, my gallant cou&s;in, who had by his bravery rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the rank of major, was killed in the late action in Germany. I have mo&s;t &s;incerely lamented their deaths, though an e&s;tate of two thou&s;and pounds a year has, by the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, devolved to me.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275">I &s;hall continue the &s;ame cour&s;e of life I have hitherto pur&s;ued abroad, by &s;pending my time in reading, prayer, and travel. I &s;hall never love again, <HI>for your &s;ake;</HI> nor marry, <HI>for my own.</HI> I have however, at length brought my mind to be able to think of you without perturbation, though not without regret; and thanks to reli|gion, have now the power of &s;ub&s;cribing my&s;elf, my &s;till too dear Abelard, yours Eloi&s;a&mdash;but <HI>without her conflicts.</HI></P>
<P>Our charming Hermes continues to improve in every amiable quality of face, per&s;on, &s;en&s;e, and di&s;po&s;ition. His fondne&s;s and attention to|ward me, &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of a child; for ignorant as he is of my being his parent, even his young mind &s;eems already to impute an higher merit than duty, to my love and attachment towards him.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The la&s;t part of this letter, &s;aid Mr. Carewe, revived my &s;pirits. It cancelled my fears indeed, but the former part of it, had before bereft me of my hopes. I lamented my forlorn condition, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as her hu&s;band, or rather her mournful widower, and put on black for her relations, as if they had been my own. At the &s;ame time I directed one thou&s;and pounds, out

of my <HI>adventitious</HI> fortune, to be given to the tru&s;tees for the <HI>Magdalen-Ho&uacute;&s;e,</HI> in aid of that great and two-fold charity, toward both &s;oul and body.</P>
<P>The very day I got to London I had inquired for you, my dear friend, at your hou&s;e, &s;aid he to Mr. Andrews, and being there referred to your attorney, had the &s;atisfaction of hearing that you were &s;ettled in this country; and the moment I had fini&s;hed my bu&s;ine&s;s in town, I flew down hither, to throw my&s;elf into the arms of friend&s;hip and philo&s;ophy, with a determined purpo&s;e of taking &s;ome lodge near you, and &s;pending the remainder of my days in &s;tudy, contemplation, re&s;ignation, and retirement.</P>

<P>MR. Andrews and Mr. Beville were ex|tremely charmed and entertained with Mr. Carewe's account of him&s;elf. The adven|tures he had related, both of his own, and tho&s;e of others, were uncommon, intere&s;ting, and extraordinary; and the generous and virtuous tenor of conduct he had pre&s;erved throughout,
<PB N="278" REF="277">
though interrupted now and then, by the natu|ral lap&s;es of human frailty, had &s;tamped a cha|racter for him, as perfect, I am afraid, as fle&s;h, <HI>male</HI> fle&s;h at lea&s;t, is capable of.</P>
<P>They highly approved and commended the honour and virtue of his de&s;ign, in marrying the mo&s;t amiable and excellent Eloi&s;a; and joined cordially in condoling with him, on ac|count of the unlucky di&s;appointments he had met with, in &s;o hone&s;t and proper a pur&s;uit. They rejoiced extremely at his purpo&s;e of taking a hou&s;e in their neighbourhood, and that decla|ration had now rendered this friendly Triumvi|rate as happy, as it was po&s;&s;ible for them to be, in their pre&s;ent re&s;pective circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>They lived together in perfect harmony, at the farm, during the remainder of the &s;ummer; but there was one particular, with regard to Mr. Carewe, that puzzled and &s;urpri&s;ed his two friends extremely. He had related his memoirs to them, with all the appearance of frankne&s;s and confidence imaginable, &s;o as that no per&s;on who had heard him, could po&s;&s;ibly have &s;u&s;|pected that any one &s;ecret, or anecdote, even of the mo&s;t trifling con&s;equence, had &s;till remained behind. And yet, they had &s;een him frequently receive letters, the &s;uper&s;cription a &s;air and female hand, which he never communicated the lea&s;t
<PB N="279" REF="278">
of, to either of them; and whatever an&s;wers he wrote, he always u&s;ed the re&s;erve of carrying to the po&s;t-office him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There was another circum&s;tance, with regard to this corre&s;pondence, that joined to rai&s;e their &s;urpri&s;e &s;till higher; which was, that the&s;e letters were written on mourning paper, and &s;ealed with black wax. This particular inclined them to &s;u&s;pect that they had come from the fair fugitive, or mi&s;taken exile; and what further article, re|lative to her, need now remain a my&s;tery be|tween them, was both their curio&s;ity and won|der. However, it was too delicate a point to touch upon&mdash;We have no right over other peo|ple's &s;ecrets; &s;o let this continue one, till he may him&s;elf think proper to reveal it.</P>
<P>The three friends remained together on the&s;e terms, till about the middle of September, when Mr. Carewe, on the receipt of one of the&s;e un|communicated epi&s;tles, told Mr. Andrews that he &s;hould be obliged to take leave of him for a &s;hort time, upon bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome con&s;equence, which was not then ripe enough to communi|cate with his good friends at the farm.</P>
<P>Mr. Beville who was pre&s;ent, joined with Mr. Andrews in wi&s;hing him a good journey, a &s;ucce&s;sful event to his new adventure, and a quick return into his pre&s;ent &s;ociety. Mr. Ca|rewe
<PB N="280" REF="279">
thanked them, and appeared for the re&s;t of that day, more chearful and di&s;engaged in his conver&s;ation and manners, than he had been at any time during his re&s;idence among them. The next morning he ro&s;e before day, and rode off from the farm, without di&s;turbing his friends.</P>

<P>ABOUT a fortnight after their &s;eparation, Mr. Andrews received the following mo&s;t extraordinary letter from Mr. Carewe, dated from <HI>Condi&s;ciple-Hall:</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;o unre&s;erved and voluntary a re|lation of the various incidents of my life, it mu&s;t certainly appear a great in&s;tance of di&s;in|genuou&s;ne&s;s in me, to have &s;ecreted any one particular of my private hi&s;tory from you. But your having mentioned the name of <HI>Ethelinda,</HI> with Mr. Bevill's unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion for her, was the rea&s;on of my not informing you &s;ooner, that my connections with that lady, were of a
<PB N="281" REF="280">
much ealier date, than his acquaintance with her.</P>
<P>I happened to be out of the kingdom, when &s;he was married; &s;he too ea&s;ily &s;ubmitted to the arbitrary commands of a father, and yielded to duty, without approbation, or choice. I be|came acquainted with this misfortune, time enough only to lament, but not prevent the too di&s;cordant union.</P>
<P>She was however, &s;oon relea&s;ed from her heavy bondage; for your friend died in a few days after your departure from hence, of the di&s;order you had left him labouring under, la&s;t Chri&s;tmas; and leaving her a childle&s;s widow, has, in con&s;ideration of her merit and behaviour towards him, endowed her with his whole for|tune, amounting to fifteen hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain you longer, on a &s;ubject which mu&s;t be extremely unea&s;y to Mr. Beville, con&s;equently to you, and am in ha&s;te to inform you that in a &s;ort of clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence which I held with this lady, while I was at your hou&s;e, I have had the fortune to prevail on her to adventure upon the &s;tate of matrimony again; and I mu&s;t now beg leave to intreat the plea&s;ure of your's and Mr. Beville's company to &s;pend the <HI>honey-moon</HI> with us, at this place, from the
<PB N="282" REF="281">
beginning of next month. I &s;hould not have had the pre&s;umption to make this reque&s;t, if the fair Ethelinda did not join me in it. Ye were both pre&s;ent at her fir&s;t marriage, at another's fuit, and ye are now invited to her &s;econd, at her own.</P>
<P>Let not my &s;incerity be at all impeached, upon this occa&s;ion. I do &s;till love the dear Eloi&s;a, with all that warmth of pa&s;&s;ion I have &s;o lately expre&s;&s;ed before you, and declare that were &s;he within my gra&s;p, I would this in&s;tant, kneel down with her, before the altar. But even hope is fled! this lady then, holds only the &s;econd rank in my affections&mdash;but I &s;incerely wi&s;h her happy, and may perhaps, without vanity, pro|nounce that I have it in my power to render her &s;o. The fond lover wi&s;hes his own happine&s;s; the generous one that of his mi&s;tre&s;s. This for Mr. Beville. Adieu.</P>

<P>MR. Andrews was both a&s;toni&s;hed and per|plexed, upon reading this letter. He did not know how to reconcile the purport of it, to honour; nor yet could he &s;ay upon what punc|tilio of moral, to reprehend it. Mr. Carewe's having entered into an engagement with one woman, while he was riding po&s;t after another; his &s;upplanting a man, with whom he had ap|peared voluntarily to have linked him&s;elf in a league of friend&s;hip; and his rivalling a real lover, without even pleading pa&s;&s;ion for an ex|cu&s;e; &s;eemed all perfectly incon&s;i&s;tent with the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his character.</P>
<P>And yet, on the other hand, might he not have engaged him&s;elf in this amour, at &s;ome interval before his honour and virtue had been awakened toward the amiable Eloi&s;a? Might not the interpo&s;ition of parents have &s;natched this fair one from his arms, when he had ju&s;t won her affections? Might not the de&s;pair of ever being able to recover his fir&s;t object, have &s;uf|fered the &s;econd to take place? like mercantile bills, <HI>Pay this my &s;econd of exchange, the fir&s;t not paid.</HI> Whenever a que&s;tion can admit of a fa|vourable
<PB N="284" REF="283">
con&s;truction, charity &s;hould ever adopt it; as in the Engli&s;h laws, every per&s;on is &s;up|po&s;ed to be innocent, till the contrary is proved.</P>
<P>After the&s;e reflections, Mr. Andrews ventured to communicate the letter to his friend. He re|ceived it like a man&mdash;with re&s;entment and re&s;o|lution. He lamented his having never heard of the Condi&s;ciple's death, till it was too late to profit of it. And yet what a mortification and di&s;appointment had he e&s;caped, by his ignorance of it! he regretted his death, which had afforded him at lea&s;t the hope of po&s;&s;ibility, merely to &s;hut it out for ever.</P>
<P>He then &s;eemed generou&s;ly to rejoice in an event, which had yielded his adored Ethelinda &s;o fair a pro&s;pect of happine&s;s for life. He had him&s;elf &s;u&s;tained no wrong, had &s;uffered no in|ju&s;tice. The injury he had received was from fate alone, and he was re&s;olved to di&s;appoint its malice, by &s;hewing him&s;elf, through re&s;ignation, unworthy of the infliction.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews &s;econded his philo&s;ophy, by adding the latter part of his own reflections, mentioned above, in order to reconcile him to Mr. Carewe, and prevail on him to accept of his invitation to the wedding. This however, he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, for &s;ome time. But
<PB N="285" REF="284">
Mr. Andrews urging Ethelinda's reque&s;t, who&s;e knowledge of his pa&s;&s;ion he had never been in|formed of, and which intirely &s;creened the im|propriety of her invitation, at length prevailed upon him to exert a bravery which Mr. Andrews was charmed with; for after that effort &s;hould be over, he was in hopes of retrieving his dear friend back again into the world, once more.</P>
<P>The&s;e two philo&s;ophic friends then imme|diately began to prepare them&s;elves for the un|grateful journey; but were prevented by Mr. Beville's falling ill of a &s;low fever, which had been creeping on him for &s;everal days, and at la&s;t confined him to his room, the very day that had been fixed on for their departure. His feel|ings were too &s;trong for his philo&s;ophy, and though the mind had triumphed, its victory was over the body.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews &s;ent directly for a phy&s;ician, and wrote an apology to Mr. Carewe, wi&s;hing him and the fair Ethelinda compleat happine&s;s, both in his own name, and Mr. Beville's al&s;o, who had generou&s;ly de&s;ired his compliments to be added, upon this occa&s;ion. Mr. Andrews was extremely alarmed at his friend's danger, and a good deal puzzled al&s;o, with regard to the widow's character. From Mr. Carewe's letter did it not appear that there had been an engage|ment
<PB N="286" REF="285">
between them, before her marriage; and yet, at the time &s;he was made acquainted with Mr. Beville's unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, did &s;he not &s;peak, though with a becoming prudence and mode&s;ty, yet in &s;uch a manner, as might have in&s;pired the fonde&s;t hopes, &s;hould her hand have ever been again at her own di&s;po&s;al? and yet&mdash; but woman is woman&mdash;varium et mutabile! and love has its own laws; arbitrary, and ca|pricious!</P>

<P>MR: Beville declined every day, notwith|&s;tanding all the aid of phy&s;ic, and his life was almo&s;t de&s;paired of, when to poor Mr. Andrews's great &s;atisfaction, he &s;aw his worthy friend, the clergyman, alight at the door. This vi&s;it had an happy effect upon our patient, his conver&s;ation &s;oothed his &s;pirits, the &s;ociety of a friend ranks high among the Materiae Me|dicae, and his pre&s;cription &s;oon re&s;tored his health. He admini&s;tered James's powders to him, and his fever quitted him the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286">The re-union of the&s;e three friends, was &s;uch a plea&s;ure, as the reader, who has either virtue or &s;entiment, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e to him&s;elf, better than I can expre&s;s it; and if he wants &s;en&s;e or feeling, no words can convey an idea of it to him. Mr. Beville continued for &s;ome days con|fined to his bed, which left Mr. Andrews an opportunity of communicating to his friend the clergyman, when they were alone, Mr. Carewe's letter, with ju&s;t &s;o much of his &s;tory, and of Beville's, as was nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>explain,</HI> and render it <HI>unaccountable,</HI> at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The morning that Mr. Beville found him&s;elf able to quit his chamber, and while they were walking about the parlour, and conver&s;ing toge|ther in a more free and di&s;ingaged manner than u&s;ual, they perceived a coach and &s;ix, with a large retinue, driving toward the hou&s;e. They all looked out at the window, without being able to gue&s;s what new adventure was going to occur, when the equipage &s;topt at the door, and they &s;aw Mr. Carewe alight, leading forth the fair mourning bride, by the hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews and the clergyman were much embarra&s;&s;ed, upon this occa&s;ion, on account of poor Mr. Beville, who changed colour at the &s;ight, and walked in&s;tantly away from the window; but quickly recollecting him&s;elf, he turned about

<P>MR. Andrews was in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that he &s;uffered his new gue&s;ts to come into the room before he could &s;tep forward to meet them. Welcomes, embracings, and wi&s;hing of joy, were given, and received, with equal &s;tiff|ne&s;s;

It mu&s;t have been a greater painter of the pa&s;&s;ions than <HI>Le Brun,</HI> who could have drawn this groupe of per&s;ons up to the life. For though our new gue&s;ts might have been ever &s;o capable of ju&s;ti|fying their own conduct, upon logical princi|ples, yet <HI>beyond the fixed and &s;ettled rules,</HI> there is an undefinable moral; and in the &s;lighte&s;t ap|pearance of di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, &s;omething highly offen&s;ive to liberal minds.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="288">The beauty of the lovely widow tran&s;cended her wedding charms, which had then wanted a year of their perfection. Her per&s;on was now compleatly formed, her carriage ea&s;ier, and more free her air. A lively &s;pirit had informed her eyes&mdash;not by &s;upplanting mode&s;ty, but cor|recting ba&s;hfulne&s;s. The ro&s;es in her cheeks were fuller blown, the cherries became more ripened in her lips, and the pearly whitene&s;s of her &s;kin, &s;hone with &s;uperior lu&s;tre &s;et in weeds.</P>
<P>This garb declared her &s;till to be a widow, which added to the di&s;tre&s;s of the three friends, who were in hopes the marriage-ceremony had been over, without their being obliged to be the mournful witne&s;&s;es of it. After about two hours con&s;trained conver&s;ation, among four of the company, Mr. Beville doing nothing all the while, but gaze and &s;igh, dinner was &s;erved; which did not hold them long at table, for Mr. Andrews had not been &s;ufficiently prepared for a wedding fea&s;t.</P>
<P>After tea and coffee was over, and that Ethe|linda had retired to the library, Mr. Carewe, turning to the clergyman, &s;aid that he looked upon it as a fortunate circum&s;tance, to meet him at the farm, upon this occa&s;ion, as the character he had been taught to conceive of him, from Mr. Andrews's repre&s;entation, might pro|mi&s;e

<P>My dear brother and benefactor, my unhappy &s;i&s;ter brought you no fortune, and her worth needed no addition; but as her lo&s;s wants much repair, you'll give me leave to pre&s;ent you with this bill, which Providence &s;eems to have kept detached from the re&s;t of its unmerited bounties to me, in order to inable me to pay my debts, both of obligation and of honour.</P>

<P>THE &s;torm commenced at ten o'clock in the morning, was at the height at five in the evening, and continued without abatement, till twelve at night. It then began to &s;ub&s;ide, and about four the next morning, the wind &s;eemed to cea&s;e, as being out of breath; when Mr. Andrews was awakened by his &s;ervants coming into his chamber, to tell him that one of the neighbouring villagers had ju&s;t then run up to the hou&s;e, to acquaint him that a &s;hip had been &s;tranded and beat to pieces, near the farm; that the few pa&s;&s;engers who had e&s;caped the waves, were in the highe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and that the country was ha&s;tening down upon the &s;hore, to <HI>make a wreck</HI> of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews, who&s;e whole &s;oul had received the in&s;piration of public virtue, had taken out a commi&s;&s;ion of the peace for the &s;hire of York, as &s;oon as his hou&s;e was built; which with the character he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, even in the &s;hort

<P>He aro&s;e in&s;tantly, and &s;ent to Mr. Carewe and the clergyman, to do the &s;ame. They all dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, armed them&s;elves, their &s;ervants, and the labourers, without di&s;|turbing Mr. Beville, for fear of alarming the bride; mounted their hor&s;es, and galloped down to the &s;hore. At about a mile's di&s;tance, they &s;aw the &s;hip, in a &s;hattered condition, lying on its &s;ide, in &s;hallow water, on the tide's ebb.</P>
<P>They perceived many bodies floating, &s;everal per&s;ons wading through the &s;ea, &s;ome &s;tanding &s;till, with imploring arms extended toward the &s;trand, others fainting through weakne&s;s, and thrown often on their faces by the &s;lighte&s;t wind or wave. The populace that had lined the &s;hore, awed by authority, and <HI>arms,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed immediately upon the appearance of Mr. An|drews, who with Mr. Carewe rode through the tide, attended by their party, to the &s;uccour of this poor &s;hip-wrecked crew, and &s;oon brought them all, the dead, the dying, and the &s;urviving, to a little village near the &s;hore.</P>

<P>MR. Carewe, in vi&s;iting one of the <HI>ho&s;pitals</HI> in his department, was told by the wo|man of the hou&s;e, that a beautiful young lady had been given into her charge, who appeared to be dead, but that on holding her up by the heels, for &s;ome time, till a great quantity of water had run off from her &s;tomach, then put|ting on a warm &s;hift, and placing her in an aired bed, &s;he had &s;eemed to afford &s;ome tokens of returning life, and might probably be &s;aved, if any one could be got to bleed her in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe quick ran through the &s;treets, crying out for a &s;urgeon, a barber, or even a lance; when the clergyman hearing him, came out of a cottage, with a bloody lancet in his hand, and offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;aying that he had ju&s;t then performed an operation with &s;uc|ce&s;s, on a young gentleman who was mourned as dead, by his weeping &s;ervants. Mr. Carewe ran back with him to his fair patient. The cler|gyman pierced her arm, and &s;ome blood flowed &s;lowly for about half a minute, toward the end of which &s;he &s;eemed to breathe, and at length her eyes opened.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="297">During this interval, Mr. Carewe leaned over the bed, examining the features of the patient, with a look of earne&s;tne&s;s, of doubt, and in|quiry; but on her opening her eyes, he threw him&s;elf on his knees, and catching her in his arms, cried out, My lo&s;t, my recovered love, my con&s;tancy's reward, my virtue's praemium! O turn, and behold your friend, your lover, your hu&s;band, a penitent at your feet! O let&mdash; He was going on, when at the &s;ound of the&s;e la&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he interrupted him with a &s;ud|den &s;tart, and turning her languid eyes upon him, endeavoured to utter &s;omething, when her arm &s;topped bleeding, and &s;he, without a figh or &s;truggle, in&s;tantly expired in his arms.</P>
<P>The wretched Carewe &s;tared wildly on the corp&s;e for a time, without drawing his breath, or &s;peaking a word; then cla&s;ped its cold bo&s;om clo&s;e to his brea&s;t, endeavouring, but in vain, to weep; when after holding it there for a mi|nute, with his eyes fixed, as in death, he ca&s;t it &s;uddenly from him, and &s;pringing upon his feet, cried out, I am damned&mdash;&s;he is gone, Heaven's me&s;&s;enger, to &s;end the furies for me! Infinite ju&s;tice mu&s;t have atonement for innocence de|filed! No &s;alvo's here! I have but one life to pay, but give it freely&mdash;O may it be accepted
<PB N="299" REF="298">
like the widow's mite, and wipe from out my &s;core, the multitude of my offences!</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he &s;natched up the lance, which the clergyman, through his a&s;toni&s;hment and terror at this extraordinary and affecting &s;cene, had left neglected on the table, and would have de&s;troyed him&s;elf with it, if he had not, on the in&s;tant, recovered pre&s;ence of mind enough to &s;pring forward with a bri&s;k action, and catch hold of his arm. The poor di&s;tracted Carewe &s;truggled for a while, till wa&s;ting his &s;trength in exclamation, and dropping the lance on the floor, he &s;unk into a chair.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this moment the door opened, and the young man who had been recovered by bleeding, walked &s;lowly into the room, leaning on Mr. Beville, with his arm tied up, his air languid, and his face &s;icklied o'er with weakne&s;s, fatigue, and grief. But under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, it was ea&s;y to perceive a mo&s;t beautiful compo&s;i|tion of features, a fine proportioned &s;hape, with a mo&s;t graceful figure. He was led toward the bed, but upon viewing the corp&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed an heavy moan, and fainted on the body.</P>

<P>MR. Carewe, who&s;e chair had been turned from this &s;cene, being rou&s;ed by the noi&s;e, &s;tarted ha&s;tily up, and beholding the dy|ing embrace, cried out, What, a rival in death, al&s;o! O haple&s;s youth&mdash;O happy rather&mdash;no more the object of my jealou&s;y, but envy&mdash; who&s;e grief equalling thy love, hath forbid thy life one moment to &s;urvive thy lo&s;s!</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Beville and the cler|gyman did every thing in their power to recover the young man from his &s;woon; and after they had rai&s;ed him up, &s;prinkled water in his face, and applied &s;alts to his no&s;e, they had the plea|&s;ure to find him coming a little to his &s;en&s;es; upon which they placed him in a chair, and &s;pread a covering over the corp&s;e, to hide it from the view of the di&s;tracted corrivals.</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe &s;tood all this while in the middle of the room, with his arms folded acro&s;s, his eyes fixed on the ground, and his &s;oul labour|ing with the mo&s;t di&s;mal reflections; when upon hearing the young man's voice, who had now begun to make acknowledgments to his kind a&s;|&s;i&s;tants, he &s;tared, he li&s;tened, he &s;tarted, and
<PB N="301" REF="300">
extending wide his arms, Gracious Heaven! cried he out, what will the fates do with me? What! dead, and alive, at once! does Provi|dence then make &s;port of torments! 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible&mdash;and yet 'tis certain&mdash;'Tis &s;he, my Har|riot lives! O let me catch her in the&s;e arms, once more, though the extreme of bli&s;s &s;hould prove too &s;trong for life it&s;elf to bear!</P>
<P>He &s;prung forward at the&s;e words, fell kneel|ing at her feet, gra&s;ped her hand with rapture, and gazed upon her face with fondne&s;s, &s;urpri&s;e, and joy. Her a&s;toni&s;hment was likewi&s;e great, and her difficulties no le&s;s; though Mr. Beville, upon the fir&s;t alarm of this di&s;covery, was &s;o polite as to remove &s;ome of them, by quitting the room, and taking the clergyman along with him.</P>
<P>Eloi&s;a trembled all over, and could not re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t tran&s;ports, her own pa&s;&s;ion &s;ympathi&s;ing with his; but recollecting her&s;elf &s;oon, and forcing her&s;elf from his hold, Mr. Carewe, &s;aid &s;he, with a blu&s;h, the &s;urpri&s;e of this adventure, has thrown us both too much off our guard&mdash; there is one, I pre&s;ume, to whom the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, the&s;e regards, more properly belong; and I in|treat that you may no longer injure your own honour, nor attempt to di&s;turb my peace, again.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="301">Oh! my lamented, far-&s;ought love, my ever-e&s;teemed, and long-purpo&s;ed wife, cried he out with impatience, your mi&s;take in this particular, has been the fatal cau&s;e of our tedious and un|happy &s;eparation. The expre&s;&s;ion I made u&s;e of to your &s;teward, was fondly meant toward you; and I had before then been for &s;ome time in que&s;t of you, and have ever &s;ince, with con|&s;tant ardour, pur&s;ued your flight in vain, through mo&s;t of the countries in Europe.</P>
<P>I do confe&s;s my truant youth had been too in&s;en&s;ible of the love I bore you, at our parting; but upon comparing my &s;entiments of you, with the tran&s;ient and un&s;atisfactory pa&s;&s;ions, with which all other objects had been capable of in|&s;piring me &s;ince, I &s;oon perceived my happine&s;s wound up in yours; your love alone the means, and your alliance the &s;ole end of all my future bli&s;s.</P>
<P>As he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words, a &s;udden bur&s;t of triumphant tears flowed down her lovely cheeks, and &s;he &s;unk into his arms, &s;upporting her&s;elf from falling, by a clo&s;e embrace; while the o'erpowered Carewe could an&s;wer only with his arms, his looks, and &s;ighs.

<P>MR. Carewe, as &s;oon as he could recollect any thing which did not immediately relate to his pa&s;&s;ion, led his Eloi&s;a out of the room where the corp&s;e lay, into one adjoining it, on pretence that &s;he might remain more pri|vate here to change her dre&s;s, and commence <HI>a woman</HI> now for life. In order to which tran&s;|formation, he &s;ent into the next cottage, where the farm-wardrobe had been depo&s;ited, and ob|tained for her a compleat &s;uit of female cloaths and linen.</P>
<P>He was extremely unhappy about his &s;on, whom he apprehended to have been &s;wallowed up in the waves, but was too tender to make any inquiry concerning him, which might awaken his Eloi&s;a to di&s;traction. However, upon find|ing her, without either lamentation or inquiry after him, returning again to tears and exclama|tions, on the death of the lady in the next room, he &s;topt her &s;hort, by crying out, But fir&s;t my
<PB N="304" REF="303">
Hermes, O what of him? Thanks to all-pro|tecting Heaven, replied &s;he, in a tran&s;port, I left him behind at Thoulou&s;e, when my dear &s;i&s;ter, who has ju&s;t expired, called on me there with her hu&s;band, in their route from Mont|pelier to Portugal.</P>
<P>I loved her, &s;aid &s;he, renewing her tears, with the fondne&s;s of a &s;i&s;ter enlivened by the warmth of a friend. It was &s;ome years &s;ince we had parted la&s;t, I found my&s;elf unhappy at the thought of her quitting me &s;o &s;oon, and re&s;olved to accompany her on her tour; &s;o leaving our dear child in the care of my faithful &s;teward, I proceeded on the journey along with my &s;i&s;ter and brother, and arrived &s;afe at Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t amiable pair, continued &s;he, about a year before, had lo&s;t two lovely children, their whole &s;tock, in the &s;mall-pox. The grief of the parents was immoderate, and in a &s;hort time affected both their healths. My poor &s;i&s;ter had got the addition of a &s;evere cold, by &s;itting up day and night with her children. Her di&s;order fell upon her lungs, and &s;oon &s;hewed certain &s;ymptoms of a decay.</P>
<P>My dear brother, who loved her pa&s;&s;ionately, had a con&s;ultation of phy&s;icians upon her ca&s;e; who after having <HI>practi&s;ed on her,</HI> without effect, advi&s;ed her going to Spa; from thence &s;he was
<PB N="305" REF="304">
&s;ent to Aix, thence to Montpelier, and then to Li&s;bon. This <HI>cour&s;e,</HI> which we may better &s;tyle <HI>a tour,</HI> had it been capable of an&s;wering any other end than mere amu&s;ement, was as nece&s;|&s;ary to her hu&s;band, as to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Men's minds, they &s;ay, are &s;tronger than ours, and I believe it; but then, I am of opinion al&s;o, that their &s;trength &s;erves them bet|ter to re&s;i&s;t, than to endure misfortune. Throw them but a moment off their guard, till calamity &s;hall have &s;lipt into their brea&s;ts, their re&s;ent|ments and &s;truggles being greater, the &s;ooner weaken their force. The convul&s;ions of a giant are an earthquake to tho&s;e of a dwarf.</P>
<P>Whether &s;uch was the ca&s;e, or no, with re|gard to this worthy man, or whether his unhap|pine&s;s infinitely exceeded her's, by fore&s;eeing her early death, I cannot determine, but about a month ago, after we had been at Li&s;bon near a quarter of a year, he was attacked by a fever on his &s;pirits, which put an end to his life in ten days.</P>
<P>What a wretch did he leave behind him! &s;he was deprived of rea&s;on for three days, and the moment &s;he recovered it, &s;he re&s;olved upon quitting the kingdom in&s;tantly. She was redu|ced now to a weaker &s;tate than ever, and I
<PB N="306" REF="305">
would have deferred her voyage till the &s;pring, but &s;he was inflexible.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked the phy&s;icians there, what climate they would now recommend to my dear &s;i&s;ter, to breathe in; but they replied, that Li&s;bon was the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of health, and that &s;ince it had not done her any &s;ervice, they feared no other region on the globe would avail, except the re|turning again to her <HI>native air,</HI> might produce &s;ome &s;alutary effect; and which was a thing fre|quently recommended, by the <HI>college.</HI></P>
<P>We then began to prepare for our voyage, for I was re&s;olved to accompany her into England, and retire with her to &s;ome private country &s;cene, where &s;he had never &s;een either her chil|dren, or her hu&s;band, or any thing which might remind her particularly of either.</P>
<P>There would I have remained with her, till &s;he &s;hould be either relea&s;ed from a &s;ickly and unhappy life, or &s;o far re&s;tored to health, as to be able to accompany me in my &s;cheme of travel|ling, and purpo&s;e of living abroad. We waited &s;ome time for a &s;hip, at la&s;t we embarked, the wind changed and &s;hifted us out of our cour&s;e, and after &s;ome days &s;ailing to and fro, drove us at length, amid&s;t this perilous &s;torm. The re&s;t you know.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="306">Mr. Carewe embraced her at this period, wi|ping away her tender tears with ki&s;&s;es; then leaving her to change her dre&s;s, went out to in|quire after &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers, whom &s;he &s;aid were per&s;ons &s;he had lately become acquainted with, and conceived a friend&s;hip for; and who&s;e &s;afety therefore, &s;he was &s;incerely intere&s;ted in.</P>
<P>When he got into the &s;treet, he met Mr. Be|ville coming from vi&s;iting one of the cottages, and taking him by the arm, You &s;ee, my dear brother, &s;aid he, that Providence has at length, thought fit to ble&s;s my wi&s;hes with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the amiable Eloi&s;a again; but I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it that you never reveal the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of our love, to any per&s;on what&s;oever, not ex|cepting my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Had I retained the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope, of ever recovering her again, I &s;hould not have been &s;o unguarded, even to my deare&s;t friends. But though there is nothing in her mo&s;t private memoirs, &s;o circum&s;tanced, and &s;o uninformed as &s;he really was, at a cer|tain aera, which ought to affect her character, in the opinion of philo&s;ophy or candour, yet wo|men or the world are apt to cen&s;ure failings, which their own feelings &s;hould incline them to excu&s;e.</P>

<P>DURING all the&s;e tran&s;actions, Mr. An|drews was extremely active in his depart|ment, &s;upplying wine which he had ordered down from his own hou&s;e, and raiment which he purcha&s;ed from the inhabitants, to the &s;ailors, and poor pa&s;&s;engers who had e&s;caped the wreck, and came half naked to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The captain of the ve&s;&s;el too, was one of the objects which fell under his attention; but he refu&s;ed any kind of help, except brandy; nor did he afford the lea&s;t manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to any
<PB N="309" REF="308">
one of the crew, though well enough able to have done it, as he had e&s;caped free from all damage, but wetting. He &s;at by a cabbin fire, drying the cloaths, on his back, &s;moaking a pipe, quaffing off half pints of brandy at a draught, and &s;wearing at the &s;torm &s;o loud and impiou&s;ly, as were enough to have provoked a &s;econd tem|pe&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews, having now fini&s;hed his circuit, and provided for every thing in his rounds, came at length to the hou&s;e where we are at pre&s;ent, to re&s;t him&s;elf, and pay his particular compli|ments to the ladies whom he had before left un|der the care of Mrs. Beville. He arrived ju&s;t at the time that Beville and Carewe came to the door, and they all walked into the parlour toge|ther; where they were hardly &s;eated, when the clergyman, who had been active in his office of vi&s;iting, praying by, and exhorting of the &s;ick, came in, and took his &s;eat among them.</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe, impatient to communicate his joy, taking Mr. Andrews by the hand, cried out, in a tran&s;port, O my dear friend, my Eloi&s;a is found among the wreck, is recovered to life, and has this moment accepted my hand. Mr. Andrews, overcome both with plea&s;ure and &s;ur|pri&s;e, had power to expre&s;s him&s;elf no other
<PB N="310" REF="309">
way, than by catching him in his arms, and &s;hedding &s;ilent, &s;peaking tears.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. Carewe could di&s;engage him|&s;elf, he turned toward Mrs. Beville and the clergyman, who though one of them knowing nothing at all, and the other nothing material of his &s;tory, were both mo&s;t heartily wi&s;hing him joy, and immediately related to them a &s;hort extempore novel of his love, which &s;ati&s;|fied their curio&s;ity, as well as the real adventure would have done.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t difficulty his invention had to &s;truggle with here, was how to account for his Harriot's appearance in men's cloaths; but the turn he gave to it at la&s;t, was, that being re|&s;olved to inform her&s;elf of every thing worth &s;eeing or knowing, while &s;he was in Portugal, &s;he had di&s;gui&s;ed her &s;ex under a male habit, that attended by her brother-in-law, &s;he might enjoy a freedom which by the manners of that country, women are re&s;trained from.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews quick perceived the delicacy of Mr. Carewe's intention, and was highly plea&s;ed with his addre&s;s and readine&s;s of invention&mdash; <HI>Splendide mendax</HI>&mdash;He then &s;ent up his compli|ments to the two ladies above &s;tairs, to inquire how they were; and being an&s;wered that they were not yet prepared to admit a vi&s;it, he with
<PB N="311" REF="310">
the re&s;t of his company, went out together to pay their compliments to their new and fair ally &mdash;They found her compleatly dre&s;&s;ed, in Ethe|linda's fir&s;t wedding &s;uit, and rivalling the beau|ties of her bridal day.</P>
<P>A roral blu&s;h, which had diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over all her features, on &s;eeing this unexpected com|pany come into the room, enriched her charms, and bani&s;hed from her face all traces of fatigue or grief. They became enamoured of her, at fir&s;t &s;ight; and Mr. Carewe al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed im|proved beauties, and acquired graces, both in her ripened features, and now fini&s;hed form.</P>
<P>He performed the office of gentleman-u&s;her, and introduced the company to the bride, men|tioning the relation, connection, or character, of each per&s;on, re&s;pectively. She received them all with the polite addre&s;s of new acquaintances, joined to the generous warmth of old friend&s;hips; and after the u&s;ual congratulations, and occa|&s;ional civilities had been pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed among them, Mr. Andrews took Eloi&s;a by the hand, and led the way back to the hou&s;e he had ju&s;t come from, as it was the large&s;t in the vil|lage, and that he had &s;ome further ho&s;pitalities to offer to the two di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ladies who were lodged there.</P>

<P>SOON after they had come into the hou&s;e, a me&s;&s;age was delivered to Mr. Andrews, from the ladies above &s;tairs, that they would be glad of his company, along with his friends, to return them all thanks for the humane and cha|ritable a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded them, in this great ar|ticle of di&s;tre&s;s and danger. They obeyed the &s;ummons, and went up together. They found a lady alone in the room, of a genteel per&s;on, and about fifty years of age, &s;itting on the &s;ide of a bed, who upon their entrance, ro&s;e up to receive them, and addre&s;&s;ed them thus:</P>
<P>My generous friends, I have the extreme&s;t gratitude to acknowledge to you all, for your timely and nece&s;&s;ary aid, in this our great cala|mity; but my thanks are more particularly due to you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, turning her&s;elf toward Mr. Andrews, who I have the plea&s;ure to learn has been the fir&s;t mover, and chief in&s;trument, under Providence, upon this occa&s;ion. As &s;oon as I was capable, continued &s;he, of inquiring upon what coa&s;t of England I had been thrown, and had heard your name &s;ounded from below, it afforded me a &s;ingular joy, to find that we
<PB N="313" REF="312">
had owed our lives to a per&s;on, for whom, though but little known, I had been taught by others, to conceive &s;o true a friend&s;hip and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and con|founded at &s;o partial a compliment, but moving up &s;lowly toward her, and beginning by degrees, to recollect her per&s;on, cried out at length, Thou generous parent of my lo&s;t Fanny! welcome from death, and to the&s;e arms again! O! &s;ince thy kindne&s;s could not &s;ave her precious life, yet let it be &s;ome alleviation of my grief, that I have had the fortune to re&s;cue yours.</P>
<P>After they had tenderly embraced each other, the lady begging leave to &s;it down, and intreat|ing all the company to do the &s;ame, applied her&s;elf again to Mr. Andrews, &s;aying, with great emotion, O my dear nephew, urge not a &s;ubject o'er again, which is now pa&s;t lamenting for you, and but revives a fruitle&s;s grief in me; who if I feel it le&s;s, at pre&s;ent, am weaker &s;till, to bear it! &s;peak to me rather of your&s;elf, your children, and your fortunes. The&s;e be our only cares now, &s;ay what of the&s;e?</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews then gave her as &s;hort an ac|count of him&s;elf and his family, as po&s;&s;ible, by &s;aying that he was rich, and they were well; being impatient to inquire about her daughter's
<PB N="314" REF="313">
health, which he pleaded his emotion and &s;ur|pri&s;e, for not having done &s;ooner. She an&s;wered, with the fondne&s;s of a mother, My dear and only child, thank Heaven and you, is in the room within there, and out of danger; but both her mind and body, being more ea&s;ily affected than mine, have prevented her from being able yet to appear, and join in my acknowledgments.</P>

<P>JUST then, Mr. Andrews's &s;teward, who had been appointed to land the pa&s;&s;engers effects from the &s;hip, came into the room to inform him, that he had brought all the luggage &s;afe a&s;hore, and lodged them in the parlour be|low. The aunt, upon hearing this, immediately ordered a large deal box to be brought up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>She then told Mr. Andrews that &s;he had two pre&s;ents to make him, on condition that he would &s;ummon his philo&s;ophy, in aid, and arm the whole man within him, to abide the te&s;t. O! madam, exclaimed he, and cla&s;ping his hands together, Lo&s;&s;es which can be e'er for|got, may have their &s;en&s;e renewed; but in me
<PB N="315" REF="314">
what monument can awaken griefs, which never yet have &s;lept!</P>
<P>When the box was opened, &s;he took out a picture, and placed it on a chair before him. It was the horrid &s;pectacle of his wife, gho&s;t-like, and &s;low expiring, on a death-bed. He &s;tarted at fir&s;t, though prepared; then &s;tanding mute, and motionle&s;s, before it, with uplifted hands, and head reclined, gazed at the portrait, till it almo&s;t became his own. Fond Beville wept, the re&s;t joined too, in &s;ilent grief; and even the aunt, to whom notwith&s;tanding this object had now grown familiar, here dropt her &s;ympathetic tear.</P>
<P>After &s;he had &s;uffered them for a while, to in|dulge in this <Q>&s;ad luxury, to vulgar minds un|known,</Q> &s;he took out another picture, and placed it on the &s;ame chair, before the fir&s;t. This object &s;urpri&s;ed the whole company, more than the la&s;t; becau&s;e it puzzled them, with regard to the order of its &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was the portrait of Mrs. Andrews, drawn in perfect health, and beauty's bloom. The a&s;toni&s;hed hu&s;band viewed it o'er with rapture, crying aloud, Ju&s;t &s;uch &s;he was, ju&s;t &s;uch &s;he is again, an angel heavenly bright! but where the crown of glory, where the &s;eraph's plumes, which &s;hould have marked her &s;pirit for the &s;kies!
<PB N="316" REF="315">
He was continuing thus to rave, when his exta&s;y was &s;uddenly interrupted, by the original ru&s;hing into the room, and flying into his arms.</P>

<P>IN imitation of the great Timanthes, in his fa|mous picture upon the &s;acrifice of Iphigenia, I mu&s;t here <HI>let fall the curtain,</HI> to hide tho&s;e fea|tures, which no painting can expre&s;s. O reader, there is no de&s;cribing of this &s;cene! the wonder, the joy, the emotion!</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at this interview, and &s;o I hap|pened to be on the late execution at Lisbon. But this affected me much more. In the crimi|nal ca&s;e, one goes prepared with re&s;olution, a reflection on the crime, abates compa&s;&s;ion, and ju&s;tice acquie&s;ces in the rack. Philo&s;ophy be|&s;ides, informs us, that pain is tolerable, only to a certain degree, beyond which, it cea&s;es, with life together. But here, the &s;pectator is fir&s;t taken by &s;urpri&s;e, and then a willing captive, &s;urrenders him&s;elf up, bound hand and foot, to a tran&s;port of plea&s;ure, exceeding into pain.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="316">After the fir&s;t effects of amazement and joy, had a little &s;ub&s;ided, the clergyman &s;tepping for|ward, begged, that before any one &s;hould call for an explanation of this miracle, the whole company &s;hould join him in wor&s;hip, to that Almighty Being, who is the worker of all mira|cles, <Q>who &s;tilleth the raging of the &s;ea, and the noi&s;e of his waves, and the madne&s;s of the people.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxv. ver. 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The propo&s;al was readily embraced, and the re&s;t of the hou&s;e being called together, they all kneeled down to prayer. In the mid&s;t of it he introduced part of the 107th P&s;alm, from the 19th to the 32d ver&s;es, both inclu&s;ive; which was &s;o extremely applicable to the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion, that the whole congregation repeated it af|ter him, with as much fervency of devotion, as if it had been an extempore hymn.</P>
<P>When this pious duty to Providence, was ended, and that proper in&s;tructions had been given, about the unfortunate widow's funeral, they all prepared to &s;et out for the farm.

<P>AFTER dinner, tea, and the happy Eloi&s;a's wedding, were over, and that all inter|ruption of &s;ervants was removed, Mrs. Beville &s;eemed very impatient to have the my&s;tery ex|plained, of Mrs. Andrews's recovery, her long ab&s;ence from her hu&s;band and children, with her total &s;ilence toward them, during that &s;o intere&s;ting an interval.</P>
<P>She looked fir&s;t at Mr. Andrews, then at Mr. Beville, thinking it mo&s;t natural for one or other of them, to begin the inquiry&mdash;But their whole &s;ouls were &s;o much wrapt up, in the reality of her exi&s;tence, that the lea&s;t thought about reconciling of appearances, never once entered into their heads.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="318">She then turned her&s;elf toward the clergyman, wtth an eye of curio&s;ity, hinting the que&s;tion &s;he would have propo&s;ed; but he happened to be &s;o intirely occupied, in contemplations of an higher nature, that he did not remark the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of her countenance, any more than Beville or Andrews had done.</P>
<P>After the&s;e di&s;appointments, applying her&s;elf to her brother, &s;he begged of him, in a low voice, to make the propo&s;ition; but neither he, nor Eloi&s;a, to whom &s;he al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, gave the lea&s;t attention to her reque&s;t; for their hearts and minds were &s;o happily engaged in their own mutual di&s;coveries, he of her per&s;on, and &s;he of his love, that they &s;eemed to have no manner of curio&s;ity, at that time, about any matter, foreign to their own concerns.</P>
<P>The impatience of the fair Ethelinda, increa&s;ed at every difficulty&mdash;Women love <HI>little novels</HI> ex|tremely, as Mrs. Seawell &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. clxiii. parag. 4.</NOTE>, and finding that the opening of the &s;cene, re&s;ted &s;olely upon her|&s;elf, &s;he at length addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf directly to the old lady, in the&s;e words: Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I have borne my &s;hare, with great &s;incerity, in the ge|neral joy, which this happy and unexpected event in your family, has diffu&s;ed among us all; but as I happen to be one of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who

are not &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied with merely being happy, wihout knowing how they have become &s;o, I mu&s;t intreat the favour of you, to afford us a detail of all the extraordinary incidents, which mu&s;t have happened to this lady and to you, &s;ince your leaving this kingdom together.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition immediately engaged the at|tention of the re&s;t of the company, and they all joined their voices in the &s;ame reque&s;t. The good old lady bowed, and prepared her&s;elf to &s;a|tisfy their curio&s;ity&mdash;but, upon opening her mouth, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with &s;uch a fit of yawning, that &s;he was not able to utter one &s;yllable, for a con&s;iderable time; and when &s;he had compo&s;ed her mu&s;cles &s;ufficiently to &s;peak, it was only to de&s;ire a re&s;pite, till the next morn|ing; &s;aying, that the fatigue &s;he had undergone, both of body and mind, the foregoing day and night, was then calling upon her &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly, for re&s;t, that &s;he mu&s;t beg leave for the pre&s;ent, to retire to bed. The whole company bowed, and &s;ome of them <HI>nodded</HI> too; upon which hint, the aunt's motion &s;oon became general; and each party following her example, took up a can|dle, and walked away &s;upperle&s;s to their chambers.</P>

<P>PErhaps, reader, if you are a female, you may feel your&s;elf as much di&s;appointed here, madam, as the inqui&s;itive Ethelinda appears to have been, la&s;t night&mdash;but if you are a man, you have rea&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, to be greatly re|joiced at this interruption, for it is much better that &s;he &s;hould yawn her&s;elf to &s;leep, before &s;he began the &s;tory, than that you &s;hould be obliged to &s;tretch your jaws, at her <HI>narration.</HI></P>

<P>AFTER Mrs. Andrews had been given over by the phy&s;icians, at <HI>Spa,</HI> the aunt was writing a letter, one night, to Mr. Andrews, when her daughter came crying into the room, &s;aying that her dear cou&s;in had ju&s;t then expired, in her arms. The aunt ran immediately to her bed-&s;ide, and judging from all appearances, that &s;he was really dead, after &s;ome effu&s;ions of grief, returned to her letter, and added the&s;e words, <HI>Alas! our Fanny is no more!</HI> then &s;ealing it with black wax, &s;ent it off to the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Fanny, it &s;eems, had only fainted, through weakne&s;s, at this time; and the nur&s;e-tender perceiving &s;till &s;ome &s;igns of life in her patient, called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by the applica|tion
<PB N="323" REF="322">
of proper remedies, &s;he was recovered to &s;en&s;e again, before the next morning.</P>
<P>The aunt would then have recalled the la&s;t paragraph of her letter, but it was too late for that, and yet too &s;oon to venture to contradict it. Her death &s;eemed only delayed, and &s;he thought it would have been cruel, after he had received the &s;hock, to have amu&s;ed Mr. Andrews with a fruitle&s;s hope, which none of her phy&s;i|cians had in the lea&s;t encouraged.</P>
<P>Her fair cou&s;in, who was her&s;elf in a deep de|cay, and loved her with a double &s;ympathy, of affection and di&s;order, prevailed upon her, a day or two after her &s;woon, to &s;uffer her picture to be drawn, in the very &s;ituation &s;he then lay; for which &s;he gave this virtuous and philo&s;ophic rea&s;on, that the looking on it &s;ometimes, might &s;erve to mortify every vain, proud, or pre&s;ump|tuous thought, which &s;hould ever hereafter hap|pen to ari&s;e in her own brea&s;t, by &s;hewing to what a condition, even health, youth, and beauty, might be &s;o &s;uddenly reduced.</P>
<P>Mrs. Andrews continued in this langui&s;hing way, all the winter; one week giving hopes, and another de&s;pair, of her recovery, till at length, toward &s;pring, the phy&s;icians, upon find|ing her &s;till holding out in a fluctuating &s;tate, pronounced that po&s;&s;ibly, the warm air of Li&s;|bon
<PB N="324" REF="323">
might e&s;tabli&s;h her health; which hint was readily taken hold of by the aunt, both out of affection to her niece, and that &s;he imagined her own daughter might al&s;o receive &s;ome benefit from the &s;ame climate.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible for them to begin their journey, this female Triumvirate &s;et out from Spa, travelling to <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> by &s;low marches, to prevent fatigue to the two invalids.

<P>HERE, reader, have I &s;aved you a world of embarra&s;&s;ment, in this part of the &s;tory, by &s;natching it out of the mother's mouth. Why &s;hould you be reduced to grieve for a per&s;on, whom you knew not &s;ufficiently, to be con|cerned about? and why &s;hould you be delayed the plea&s;ure of hearing, that upon this lo&s;s, the aunt, to whom by her husband's will, the

<P>Whether the motion of the &s;ea, like <HI>&s;tirring up of land,</HI> might have given &s;ome latent &s;eeds of health a power to germinate&mdash;whether the &s;pring of the air, in this dry climate, might have cau&s;ed a bri&s;ker circulation in her blood&mdash;or finally, which is by no means the lea&s;t phy&s;ical <HI>hypothe&s;is</HI> of the three, whether the &s;atisfaction created in her mind, by finding her&s;elf, her husband, and her children, thus redeemed from difficulty and want, to affluence and ea&s;e, might have given a &s;alutary ela&s;ticity to her nerves, I am not philo|&s;opher enough to pronounce; nor indeed is it worth our inquiry here, while this truth is cer|tain, that Mrs. Andrews began vi&s;ibly to recover at Lisbon, in a &s;hort time after her landing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was re&s;tored to health and fea|tures again, her aunt got her portrait taken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. cxcvi. la&s;t parag.</NOTE>, for a rea&s;on of pretty much the &s;ame religious ca&s;t, with her daughter's; to &s;hew, by placing it near the former, that the hand which, to prove the

<P>WHILE Mrs. Andrews continued in a de&s;perate &s;tate of health, and even after her recovery appeared to be po&s;&s;ible, the phy&s;i|cians at Spa, had laid all per&s;ons about her, un|der an injunction to keep her mind, as much, or even more than her body, free from all manner of emotion, either of joy or grief, &s;uffering every pa&s;&s;ion and affection of the &s;oul to &s;ub&s;ide to <HI>whole&s;ome apathy.</HI></P>
<P>Our aunt took advantage of this re&s;triction. She had never ventured to tell her niece of the mi&s;taken paragraph, in her letter to Mr. Andrews; and yet without doing &s;o, how could &s;he be able to account for &s;o fond an husband's never writing a line to his wife, or troubling him&s;elf, even with inquiring about her health, from the aunt?</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="326">This precept of the phy&s;ician, then, mo&s;t luckily removed that difficulty; and having been delivered before the patient her&s;elf, the aunt immediately declared that &s;he would acquaint Mr. Andrews of this re&s;triction, by the next po&s;t; forbidding him to write any letter to his wife, thenceforward, till he &s;hould receive a licen&s;e from her, to renew his corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, &s;he a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he would direct her &s;teward to &s;end her con&s;tant ac|counts, of her husband, father, and children, which &s;he would communicate freely to her, while they all continued in an uniform and un|intere&s;ting tenor of health; but that &s;he mu&s;t not expect to hear even of a tooth-ach, or a kibed heel, till her mind &s;hould be able to &s;tand upon its own legs again.</P>
<P>The expiring Mrs. Andrews acquie&s;ced in this di&s;po&s;ition of things, not &s;o much for the expe|diency of the advice, as becau&s;e her mind had for &s;ome time, begun to wean it&s;elf from all hu|man connections; not in the lea&s;t by weakening their force in her brea&s;t, but by infinitely out|weighing them, with the regards of another life.</P>
<P>The good old woman did accordingly direct her &s;teward, in the manner &s;he had promi&s;ed, and received continued advice from him, of every change in Mr. Andrews's &s;ituation and cir|cum&s;tances;
<PB N="328" REF="327">
his <HI>debri&s;e</HI> in Hertford&s;hire; his fa|ther's death, and will, with his pre&s;ent re&s;idence near Scarborough; it was by knowing of this la&s;t particular, that &s;he had di&s;covered him &s;o quickly, at the village, upon ju&s;t hearing the name of Andrews pronounced.</P>

<P>HOwever, all the&s;e articles of his fortunes, both good and bad, with old Beville's death al&s;o, &s;he kept &s;till a &s;ecret from her niece, till after her being pronounced out of danger, at Lisbon; and then, upon her beginning to re|commence a corre&s;pondence with her husband, &s;he was made acquainted with the truth of the &s;tory. This information rendered her extremely unhappy, &s;he reflected with va&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, upon her dear husband's &s;till continuing in the &s;ame error; and was for immediately letting fly an expre&s;s to England, with a letter from her own hand, to acquaint him of her recovery.</P>
<P>But her aunt re&s;trained all this exta&s;y, by &s;ay|ing that the too &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e and joy, of &s;uch an unlocked and unhoped-for di&s;covery, might
<PB N="329" REF="328">
po&s;&s;ibly produce &s;ome dangerous effect upon his health, or mind; that &s;he might have the happi|ne&s;s of &s;eeing him, and her children together, much &s;ooner by &s;etting out immediately for Eng|land, her&s;elf, than by waiting for his coming to Lisbon; that &s;he would hire a &s;hip, and &s;ail di|rectly to <HI>Harwich,</HI> which was near her own &s;eat; and that an expre&s;s from thence, would reach him &s;ooner than the pacquet from Lisbon, going round by London.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this very good old gentlewoman, was to have wrote to Mr. Andrews, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould arrive at her own hou&s;e, to come to her, and bring his children along with him; without undeceiving him about his wife. This miracle &s;he meant to have opened to him, by degrees; and one of the methods which &s;he had purpo&s;ed to have employed toward that end, was to &s;hew him the two portraits, in the &s;ame order that &s;he did at the village.</P>
<P>She imagined that upon his &s;eeing the <HI>living picture,</HI> &s;o rever&s;ely &s;ucceed the <HI>dying one,</HI> it might naturally rai&s;e &s;ome hope, &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, &s;ome inquiry, in him, at lea&s;t, how it was po&s;&s;ible to have obtained the &s;econd portrait, after death. But we have already &s;een how little &s;ucce&s;s &s;he had upon that experiment; for the hurry of Mr. Andrews's pa&s;&s;ions, when his dear Fanny
<PB N="330" REF="329">
was the object, left him no lei&s;ure for the exer|ci&s;e of his rea&s;on or reflection. Which, joined to the impatience of the fond Mrs. Andrews, precipitated the deno&uuml;ement, before the plot had ripened to maturity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Andrews approved extremely, of this whole plan of operation, and they began to pre|pare them&s;elves for the voyage, with the utmo&s;t expedition; and hired a &s;hip to &s;et &s;ail the next morning, for England; when an extraordinary accident happened, which detained them at Li&s;|bon, for above four months after their prepara|tions for &s;etting out.</P>

<P>THERE was a prie&s;t, who lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with them, and with whom they had become very intimate, by their frequent intercour&s;e with the people of the family. He was a lively agreeable per&s;on, with an elegant ta&s;te in polite literature; and having been born and bred a Frenchman, had &s;omething extremely ea&s;y and polite, in his addre&s;s and manners.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="330">The only point of good breeding, in which he &s;eemed to be deficient, was his too frequently urging the argument of religion, in conver&s;ation. But all his &s;chola&s;tic divinity, and je&s;uitical &s;o|phi&s;try, were with ea&s;e expo&s;ed, by Mrs. An|drews, from the extreme per&s;picuity of her own natural &s;en&s;e, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in&s;tructions &s;he had &s;o frequently received, from her learned and in|genious friend, the clergyman.</P>
<P>Mrs. Andrews's under&s;tanding, with her re|turning beauty, began &s;oon to attract the regards of the abb&eacute;; and his particular addre&s;s toward her, became at length, &s;o remarkable, as to give her offence. When &s;he perceived it, &s;he com|menced a re&s;erve, by degrees, till &s;he had with|drawn her&s;elf intirely from any manner of &s;o|ciety with the family where &s;he lodged; and af|terwards refu&s;ed the vi&s;its of the abb&eacute;, on pre|tence of indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Affairs were in this &s;ituation, when a &s;hip was hired, and the ladies were to have &s;et &s;ail the next morning, at ten o'clock. But at the hour of twelve, the night before, after they had both been in bed for &s;ome time, they were awakened by a loud knocking at the portal of the hou&s;e. The door was opened, and the noi&s;e cea&s;ed there for a few minutes, but was again repeated at the bed-chamber
<PB N="332" REF="331">
door, where Mrs. Andrews and her aunt lay.</P>
<P>They immediately called out to inquire the cau&s;e of this di&s;turbance, and were an&s;wered by their landlady, who in a mo&s;t doleful tone of voice, informed them that the mo&s;t high and holy court of Inqui&s;ition, had &s;ent their &s;ecretary with a guard, to take Mrs. Andrews into <HI>&s;afe</HI> cu&s;tody, till a tryal &s;hould be appointed her, for certain bla&s;phemies, and profane expre&s;&s;ions, uttered by her again&s;t holy mother the church, in derogation of antient reliques, modern mira|cles, and <HI>divine</HI> &s;aint-wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The unhappy Mrs. Andrews quick perceived the prie&s;t's hand, and the <HI>cloven-foot</HI> together, in this mo&s;t horrid pro&s;ecution; which appeared &s;till plainer, after &s;he and her aunt had dre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves, and opened the door, when &s;he &s;aw the abb&eacute; enter the room, alone, with his arms folded, and his countenance ma&s;ked under an a&s;&s;umed vizard of &s;orrow and compa&s;&s;ion. But &s;oon &s;hifting his &s;aint's look to a &s;atyr's leer, he whi&s;pered to her in French, that it was in her power to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;uit, on the in&s;tant; and that upon &s;uch very ea&s;y terms as the&s;e&mdash;merely to prefer love, liberty, and life, to pri&s;on, death, and torture.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="332">I hope that none of my readers will harbour the lea&s;t manner of doubt, with regard to Mrs. Andrews's option, upon this occa&s;ion. My fe|male readers, I dare &s;wear, have already deter|mined the choice for her, between the&s;e alter|natives, as the &s;tory of the nuns of <HI>Collingham</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who cut off their no&s;es to pre&s;erve their cha&s;tity.</NOTE>, is one of their &s;tronge&s;t articles of faith.</P>
<P><Q>I doubtle&s;s do prefer, &s;aid &s;he, &s;peaking aloud, love, liberty, and life, to pri&s;on, death, and torture&mdash;but then, by infinitely greater odds, do I prefer pri&s;on, death, and torture, before pro&s;titution, infamy, and wrath. I therefore &s;ubmit my&s;elf, not to the juri&s;diction of this court, but to the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Providence, which has already re&s;|cued me from a more imminent danger, even than the pre&s;ent; but if a &s;econd miracle in my favour, may be too much for me to ex|pect, I &s;hall &s;till hope, that implored Heaven will proportion my &s;trength to the &s;truggle, and rai&s;e my virtue above my torments.</Q></P>

<P>THE condition of the unhappy aunt, who remained in uncertainty about her dear niece's life or death, during &s;everal months, may well be imagined, without the aid of de&s;cription. For the walls of the Inqui&s;ition cut off from the wretched pri&s;oner, all manner of communica|tion with the world, during her di&s;mal confine|ment in that purgatory.</P>
<P>She frequently applied to the judges of that mo&s;t iniquitous court, for leave only to &s;ee her niece, even in the pre&s;ence of any of their own officers; but was inhumanly denied that &s;ati&s;|faction. She then drew up a petition, and watched an opportunity of pre&s;enting it, in per|&s;on, to his Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty; which happened to have this good effect, that though it did not obtain her relea&s;e, it pre&s;erved her, by the king's <HI>interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> from &s;u&s;taining any manner of vio|lence, or undergoing a tryal, during her confine|ment there. For the mini&s;ter, upon hearing that a Briti&s;h &s;ubject of &s;ome note, was in que&s;|tion, thought it politic to tempori&s;e with &s;o po|tent an ally as England, while a Spani&s;h war was depending.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="334">The aunt, at one time, drew up a memorial, &s;etting forth the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, with the iniquity and malice of the abb&eacute;'s pro&s;ecution; which &s;he had de&s;igned to have delivered into the court of Inqui&s;ition. But upon communicating it to her landlord, he advi&s;ed her mo&s;t &s;tre|nuou&s;ly, again&s;t it; &s;aying that in&s;tead of re|deeming her niece by this method, &s;he would infallibly involve her&s;elf, in the &s;ame misfortune, even without the lea&s;t hope of redemption; for that the defamation of a prie&s;t, or the lea&s;t cen|&s;ure again&s;t <HI>the church,</HI> was held, among them, to be an infinitely more deadly &s;in, than the highe&s;t profanation of God, or religion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this dreadful &s;ituation had both the&s;e un|happy women remained, for about four months, without any manner of con&s;olation; except this only, which they each &s;eparately enjoyed, that poor Mr. Andrews had not been yet unde|ceived, with regard to his dear Fanny's &s;up|po&s;ed death. At the end of this period, Eloi&s;a, with her brother and &s;i&s;ter, arrived at Lisbon, and happening to take lodgings in the &s;ame <HI>h&ograve;tel</HI> with our aunt, became &s;oon acquainted with this unhappy &s;tory.</P>
<P>They all mo&s;t cordially commi&s;erated her misfortune; and the brother-in-law happening fortunately to be nephew to the new amba&s;|&s;ador,
<PB N="336" REF="335">
who had lately arrived from England to renew a treaty of alliance between the two crowns, went in&s;tantly to wait upon him, and obtained his promi&s;e that he would &s;olicit the mini&s;ter of Portugal, for Mrs. Andrews's relea&s;e, and if refu&s;ed, would even proceed &s;o far, as to intere&s;t his own court, on her behalf.</P>
<P>He kept his word punctually, with his ne|phew, and &s;ucceeded in his &s;uit; but not time enough to afford him the &s;atisfaction of knowing it; for that good and unhappy man died before Mrs. Andrews had been &s;et at liberty, which &s;he obtained but ju&s;t time enough to acknowledge her obligations to the ladies, and to accompany them, along with her aunt, in their voyage to England.</P>

<P>BUT to return to the farm. The&s;e eight per&s;ons formed one of the mo&s;t extraordi|nary and mo&s;t amiable &s;ocieties, that can well be imagined. The &s;en&s;e, virtue, fondne&s;s, friend&s;hip, and chearfulne&s;s of the whole com|pany, rendered them not only agreeable to each other, but the objects of envy or admiration, to all the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The only interruption to their enjoyments, was what Mrs. Carewe's grief for her brother and &s;i&s;ter, u&s;ed often to occa&s;ion, at fir&s;t, till it had &s;ub&s;ided by degrees, to a tender, but com|po&s;ed concern for their lo&s;s, which was confined to her own brea&s;t, and rarely broke out any more, to the di&s;turbance of the company.</P>
<P>This charming groupe of friends continued together at the farm, till the middle of Decem|ber, when Mr. Beville invited them all to &s;pend the Chri&s;tmas with him, at Condi&s;ciple-Hall&mdash; From thence they proceeded to the decea&s;ed colonel's &s;eat, to pa&s;s their Ea&s;ter with Mr. Ca|rewe; and then returned to the farm, on the Whit&s;untide following.</P>
<P>In this &s;tated rotation of friendly vi&s;its, the Triumvirate ingaged to each other, to enjoy the
<PB N="338" REF="337">
three great fe&s;tivals of religion together, during their lives; appointing the worthy clergyman to be chaplain and almoner to this &s;ociety, which &s;ub&s;cribed among them, a pur&s;e of three hun|dred pounds a year, to be di&s;tributed in charity, at his &s;ole di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The union and harmony of this happy family of friends, &s;ub&s;i&s;t unbroken &s;till, and ever mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for their connections are founded on virtue, and reciprocal obligation. Nothing worth relating has &s;ince occurred among them, except the birth of children, and the death of Mr. Carewe's father, by which his fortune has received an addition of three thou&s;and pounds a year,</P>
