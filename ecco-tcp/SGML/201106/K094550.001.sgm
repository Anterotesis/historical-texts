<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this enlightened age, when men judge intuitively of all things, it may not be improper to &s;ay a few words concerning the following work, if only to &s;ave critical &s;agacity from the misfortune of being led a&s;tray by the title.</P>
<P>In the Hi&s;tory of the Prince of Betlis, there is not one &s;oft &s;cene of love, one &s;entiment of loo&s;e de&s;ire. Outrageous Virtue is never gratified with anecdotes of private Scandal; nor Licentiou&s;ne&s;s flattered with the &s;acred name of Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">It mu&s;t not, though, be concluded from hence, that Ar&s;aces is a meer morali&s;t, or held up as a pattern of perfection, a mon&s;ter which Nature never formed. He is drawn as he was, with all his faults upon his head, &s;ubject to the power, but not the &s;lave of Pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;peaks with freedom the &s;entiments &s;ugge&s;ted by the occa&s;ion, whether gay or grave, of reprehen&s;ion or applau&s;e.</P>
<P>To wipe off the fal&s;e colourings of Prejudice, and &s;hew Truth in her native purity, is the writer's aim. How he has &s;ucceeded, is not for him to &s;ay. There is, at lea&s;t, &s;ome merit in the attempt, and upon that he humbly re&s;ts his fate.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">Amid the variety of incidents, with which our hero's life was filled, the learned reader may probably not be di&s;plea&s;ed to find &s;ome curious points of hi&s;tory brought to light, which have too long lain in unde|&s;erved ob&s;curity: Nor will he be offended at the writer's not having paid more minute attention to the manners of the times and countries, in which the various &s;cenes of his work are laid. He has endeavoured to draw the univer&s;al manners of Nature, which &s;uit all climes and ages. Greater particularity would have been only pedantry.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>AS Temugin was riding through his army, on the morning after his victory over Mohammed had added the mighty empire of Khouare&s;m to his bound|le&s;s conque&s;ts, he ob&s;erved among the captives of the war, a youth ju&s;t &s;inking under a double weight of chains, while the dignity of con&s;cious virtue &s;hone through his di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hewed a &s;oul &s;uperior to misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="22">Temugin was &s;truck with the &s;ight; and calling to the leader of the band, which guarded the captives, enquired who that youth was, and how he had merited &s;uch &s;everity.</P>
<P><Q>Lord of the Earth,</Q> an&s;wered the &s;ol|dier, <Q>this &s;lave de&s;erveth every cruelty which can be inflicted on him. He it was, who ye&s;ter evening &s;lew the valiant Togrul; and by his ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, for &s;ome time delayed the victory, which crowned your arms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Say rather,</Q> returned the captive, with a look and accent of indignant contempt, <Q>that I &s;upported faithfully the cau&s;e in which I fought; and di&s;daining life, without its greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, liberty, &s;trove, though alas! in vain, to lo&s;e both honourably together.</Q></P>
<P>The manner in which the captive &s;poke the&s;e words, heightened the favourable im|pre&s;&s;ion which his appearance had before
<PB N="3" REF="23">
made upon the heart of Temugin. <Q>Take off his chains,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>and lead him to my tent: I will examine him more particularly, when I &s;hall be at better lei&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;oldier in&s;tantly obeyed; and the captive, pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the em|peror, expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude for a favour, which darted a ray of hope through the gloom of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Other cares prevented Temugin from thinking more of this adventure for the remainder of that day; but when he re|tired in the evening to re&s;t, the idea of the captive recurred to his mind, and took &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, as to forbid every approach of &s;leep. Calling there|fore one of the eunuchs, who watched at the entrance of his tent, he commanded him to order his attendance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the captive entered, <Q>I have &s;ent for thee,</Q> &s;aid the emperor, <Q>to
<PB N="4" REF="24">
learn the &s;tory of thy life. What is thy country, thy lineage, and thy name? And by what actions ha&s;t thou &s;upported the &s;entiments, which I have heard thee utter with &s;uch energy? Ari&s;e! &s;peak the words of truth, and expect a candid hearing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Conqueror of the World,</Q> an&s;wered the captive, as he aro&s;e from the empe|ror's feet, <Q>the incidents of a life of mi&s;|fortune will afford but little entertain|ment, to one who is rai&s;ed above the reach of &s;uch him&s;elf; as they cannot intere&s;t a &s;ympathetic regard.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No &s;tate,</Q> interrupted the emperor, <Q>is exempt from the common lot of huma|nity: nor is he capable of enjoying happine&s;s him&s;elf, who is in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;ufferings of another.</Q></P>
<P>The captive replied not; but &s;eating him&s;elf on the ground, at the foot of the emperor's couch, began in the&s;e words.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<Q><P>MY name is Selim. I come from the Valley of Amoim, in Arabia the Happy; where the wi&s;dom and virtues of Abudah, my father, procured him, in a private &s;tation, a re&s;pect more &s;in|cere, than that which is u&s;ually paid to wealth and power. Much had he read, and thought &s;till more. He had al&s;o tra|velled through many nations; and by a compari&s;on of their manners, di&s;pelled the prejudices which too often &s;pread a cloud over a contracted &s;phere.</P>
<P>But he was &s;topped in his pur&s;uit of knowledge, by the nearer duties of do|me&s;tic life. The cultivation of his mind had refined, not extingui&s;hed the pa&s;|&s;ions of nature. He viewed in a light of ju&s;t contempt, the mi&s;taken, imper|fect happine&s;s of celibacy; and in obe|dience to the fir&s;t purpo&s;e of his Crea|tion, took a wife into his bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="26">Heaven &s;eemed at fir&s;t to &s;mile upon his marriage-bed; but the blo&s;&s;oms of his hope were &s;oon bla&s;ted; the hour which gave him a &s;on, depriving him of a wife.</P>
<P>Severely as he felt this lo&s;s, he &s;unk not under it. Rea&s;on &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t emotions of nature; and his piety trem|bled at the apprehen&s;ion of offending heaven, by repining at its irre&s;i&s;tible decrees. &mdash; Pardon, gracious lord, this mention of a father, to whom life is my lea&s;t obligation. It is a nece&s;&s;ary intro|duction to the &s;tory of my misfortunes. It is a tribute to his memory, which Nature will obtrude through all re|&s;traint.</P></Q>
<P><Q>Di&s;grace not rea&s;on,</Q> an&s;wered Te|mugin, <Q>by making an excu&s;e for vir|tue. Duty to a father, as it is the foun|dation, &s;o al&s;o is it the be&s;t a&s;&s;urance of loyalty to a &s;overeign. A good &s;on can|not be a bad &s;ubject.&mdash;Proceed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="27"><Q>The love,</Q> re&s;umed the captive, wip|ing away the pious tear which trickled down his cheek, <Q>which Abudah had felt for his wife, was transferred to her wretched orphan, and doubled the force of paternal affection. As &s;oon as he had paid the la&s;t debt of humanity to her beloved remains, he laid me in his bo|&s;om, and turned his &s;teps home to his native land, where his tenderne&s;s well &s;upplied the lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained.</Q></P>
<Q><P>His fir&s;t care was to lay a foundation for that health, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the enjoyment of life, and the perform|ance of all its duties. He taught me to feel no wants but tho&s;e of nature, who&s;e inevitable imbecilities were not aggra|vated by injudicious fondne&s;s. Hunger &s;weetened the mo&s;t &s;imple fare; and exerci&s;e made me find refre&s;hment in &s;leep, which was never allured by luxu|ry, nor indulged to enervating exce&s;s; while my body, gradually inured to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons, required not
<PB N="8" REF="28">
the voluptuous incumbrance of cloath|ing to &s;creen it from the &s;evere&s;t incle|mencies of weather. My food was vege|tables. I drank of the brook: and I wore no cloaths but barely what the laws of decency demanded.</P>
<P>Yet intent as he was on e&s;tabli&s;hing my health, his care was not confined to that alone. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on began to enlighten my mind, he directed my thoughts to &s;uch objects, as nece&s;&s;arily led to wi&s;dom and virtue. He imprinted upon my &s;oul a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the obedience which I owed to the Author of my being, by explaining to me my dependance on him. He taught me to read the &s;acred proofs of his wi&s;|dom, his goodne&s;s, and his power, in the tremendous volume of his works. The &s;tars of heaven &s;hewed me the glory of their Maker. The &s;un by day, and the moon by night bore witne&s;s to his power. My &s;oul was humbled before the Lord of the Univer&s;e, and adored
<PB N="9" REF="29">
the goodne&s;s which ince&s;&s;antly &s;upports the creatures of his hand.</P>
<P><Q>As the life of man is de&s;igned for action,</Q> he would &s;ay, <Q>all knowledge which leadeth not to the practice of virtue, is but vanity.</Q>&mdash;While my mind therefore was expanded by the&s;e &s;ublime &s;peculations, he explained to me the principles and rea&s;on of every duty of &s;ocial and civil life; proving that obedience, which ari&s;eth not from conviction of the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ary obligation of a law, has no more real merit, than the habitual &s;ervility of a brute animal.</P>
<P>He then unfolded to me the compli|cated relations in which man &s;tands to man, both as an individual, and as a member of a community; and from them deduced all the various duties of either &s;tate. <Q>The highe&s;t degree of perfection,</Q> would he frequently &s;ay, <Q>to which the human nature can ari&s;e,
<PB N="10" REF="30">
con&s;i&s;teth in the imitation of the divine, which is po&s;&s;ible only in benevolence; and con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of all the moral, &s;ocial, and civil virtues, how|ever varied in their appearances, in the various circum&s;tances and connections of life, from the pea&s;ant in the field, to the prince upon his throne.</Q></P>
<P>The example of his actions enforced the precepts of his wi&s;dom, and led me in&s;en&s;ibly to practi&s;e the virtues he in|culcated, as ri&s;ing years afforded ability. I &s;uffered hunger, to feed the hungry; the feeble and aged found a &s;upport in the &s;trength of my youth; and I ru&s;hed into danger to re&s;cue the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor were his in&s;tructions limited to the narrow &s;phere of our private &s;tation. As the powers of my mind became capa|ble of more extended exertion, he rai&s;ed my view to higher &s;cenes. He traced government to its origin in the gene|ral welfare and happine&s;s of mankind,

<Q><P>MY mind had followed the words of my father, continued the captive, without difficulty or doubt, while he explained the duties of life upon the principles of rea&s;on, and truth; but when he de&s;cended from them to the practice of mankind, when he came to &s;peak of the cau&s;es, and con&s;equences of war, the &s;cene was changed. I lo&s;t the awe of divine ju&s;tice, which had led me hitherto; and wandered in the perplex|ing labyrinth of human life. I &s;aw no|thing but contradictions in the ways of man. All profe&s;&s;ed to &s;eek happine&s;s, but wilfully turned away from the paths, which led directly to it. All profe&s;&s;ed virtue, but practi&s;ed vice.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="34">Fal&s;e &s;hame, (&s;hould I not rather call it pride!) would not permit me to di&s;|clo&s;e the difficulties in which I was en|tangled, to my father. I thought I could &s;truggle through them, by the &s;trength of my own mind, without be|traying my weakne&s;s, by having re|cour&s;e to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A pre&s;umption, ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by all the mi&s;eries I have &s;uffered &s;ince.</P>
<P>De&s;titute thus of the guide, who had always led my &s;teps in &s;afety, I attempted in vain to grope my way, through the darkne&s;s, with which I was enveloped on every &s;ide. I attempted to trace con&s;equences to their cau&s;es; but the attempt &s;till left me in greater uncer|tainty. I &s;aw vice triumphant! I &s;aw virtue depre&s;&s;ed! I was utterly at a lo&s;s to know, whence this could proceed. If from good, why was the contrary pre&s;cribed? If from evil, why was it permitted? My mind was perplexed with many doubts. I attempted to
<PB N="15" REF="35">
mea&s;ure the ways of heaven with the line of human rea&s;on, but it was too &s;hort; and the more I thought of the &s;ubject, I was only perplexed the more; in &s;o much, that I was at &s;ometimes al|mo&s;t tempted to doubt, whether virtue and vice differ'd more than in name! Whether heaven really interfered in the government of the world, or left it merely to chance.</P>
<P>As I &s;at one evening, on the bank of the rivulet, which runs through the vale of Amoim, wrapt in the&s;e &s;peculations, my &s;en&s;es were &s;uddenly overwhelmed with &s;leep, and I &s;aw, as in a vi&s;ion, a Being, &s;uch as the cele&s;tial &s;pirits, who watch over the actions of mankind, are repre&s;ented to be, &s;tanding be&s;ide me.</P>
<P>Regarding me for &s;ome time, with a look of reprehen&s;ion &s;oftened by pity, <Q>Son of Abudah,</Q> methought he &s;aid, in a voice which thrilled my &s;oul, <Q>thy un|happine&s;s is beheld with compa&s;&s;ion. I
<PB N="16" REF="36">
come to put a &s;top to re&s;earches, which if pur&s;ued too far, would over-turn rea&s;on. Thy knowledge is only &s;pecu|lative. Thou &s;ee&s;t man, but as in a mirrour; and do&s;t thou attempt to in|ve&s;tigate all the my&s;teries of his nature! Vain pre&s;umption! Fir&s;t look into real life; nor pretend to judge of the &s;ub|&s;tance from the &s;hadow.</Q>&mdash;Saying this he vani&s;hed from my &s;ight; and at that in&s;tant I awoke.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome moments before I re|covered from the extatick awe, with which this vi&s;ion &s;truck me. Starting up at length, and continuing the illu&s;ion of imagination, I looked eagerly around for my kind in&s;tructor; and could hard|ly believe that I had &s;een him only in a dream.</P>
<P>Nor did the di&s;covery put an end to that illu&s;ion. I con&s;idered the words of my father, <Q>that heaven often opens its will in the vi&s;ions of &s;leep, when the
<PB N="17" REF="37">
&s;oul, freed from the clogs of &s;en&s;e, is more capable of entering into inter|cour&s;e with the &s;piritual beings, which continually &s;urround us, though im|perceptible to corporeal &s;ight.</Q> &mdash; And I looked upon the reverential awe, with which I had been over-powered, as an inconte&s;tible proof, that the being, I had &s;een, was my better angel, &s;ent to me with a command from heaven, to which it was my duty to pay implicite, and in&s;tant obedience.</P>
<P>But this obedience was attended with difficulties of the weightie&s;t nature. Again&s;t the will of my father, I was &s;en&s;ible that it would be impious to be|gin, in vain to expect &s;ucce&s;s in any undertaking: And the anxiety he al|ways &s;hewed, if the ardour of the chace, or any other accident detained me out of his &s;ight, only a few minutes longer than he expected, left me no room for hope, that he would con&s;ent to my plunging thus alone, into
<PB N="18" REF="38">
the difficulties and dangers of the world.</P>
<P>In a cooler moment, this reflection would have been &s;ufficient to deter me from any attempt: but my &s;oul was now on fire; and inclination, co-ope|rating with the power of imagination, proved too &s;trong for rea&s;on. I thought I only preferred the &s;uperior duty, ex|pre&s;sly commanded by heaven, when I re&s;olved to leave my father's hou&s;e, that very night; and launch into the bound|le&s;s ocean of life, without giving him any notice of my de&s;ign; an expedient, by which I flattered my&s;elf, that by avoid|ing an expre&s;s inhibition, I evaded the crime of direct di&s;obedience, never re|membering the maxims invariably incul|cated by him, <Q>that candour is of the e&s;&s;ence of every virtue;</Q> and that <Q>no good, in the end propo&s;ed, can ju&s;tify any evil in the means made u&s;e of to attain it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="39">Vain as this eva&s;ion was, it &s;ilenced all my &s;cruples; and I attended the call of my father to our evening's repa&s;t, with a &s;erenity in my looks, which my heart was far from feeling.</P>
<P>But my &s;oul &s;oon &s;hrunk back from &s;uch deceit, and I dared not to meet his eye, or return with equal warmth the ki&s;s of love, with which he &s;ealed his benediction, when he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me, as he fondly hoped, to re&s;t. Inau&s;picious omen! Alas, too &s;trictly fulfilled by the unhappy event. Oh! where was then my guardian angel? Why had not my &s;oul &s;ome pre&s;age, that this ki&s;s would be the la&s;t, with which I &s;hould ever be ble&s;&s;ed by him! That thought would have opened my eyes; and brought me back to rea&s;on, and to virtue.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>A flood of tears here choaked the ut|terance of Selim. He hung down his head; and &s;obbing aloud gave vent to

the grief, with which the recital of this unhappy event had over-charged his heart; while Temugin kindly &s;ympathi|zing with him, interrupted not the pious offering of filial duty and affection.</P>

<P>NATURE at length being relieved by this indulgence, the captive thus con|tinued. <Q>Having but few wants, I re|quired little preparation for my intended expedition. As &s;oon as my father re|tired into his own tent to re&s;t, I girded on the &s;abre, and mounting the hor&s;e, which he had provided for me to learn the exerci&s;es of war, departed without having &s;o much as con&s;idered whither I &s;hould direct my &s;teps.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But my infatuation was too &s;trong to permit my attending to any thing, be|&s;ide compleating my e&s;cape. I therefore travelled forward during the whole night, without be&s;towing one thought on the
<PB N="21" REF="41">
folly and danger of &s;uch an undeter|mined &s;tate; or &s;topping even for a moment, till the appearance of day re|minded me of the duties of religion, when alighting from my hor&s;e, and &s;prinkling my face with an handful of &s;and, for I had no water to perform the ablution, I offered up the prayers of the morning.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Break not your narra|tive thus, by enumerating the perform|ance of religious duties,</Q> interrupted Temugin; <Q>We will &s;uppo&s;e them al|ways regularly performed.</Q> The cap|tive bowed his head in obedience, and proceeded.</P>
<Q><P>The &s;acred awe which always accom|panies acts of devotion, &s;tilled for &s;ome moments the tumult in my mind, and turned my thoughts in upon my&s;elf. I &s;tarted at the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of my &s;itua|tion, which now began to open upon me. I dared not to look back; and before me, all was darkne&s;s and di&s;may.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="42">I pau&s;ed to con&s;ider how I &s;hould pro|ceed; but before I could determine upon any thing, the power of determin|ing for my&s;elf was taken from me. A troop of Bedouins ru&s;hed from the co|vert of &s;ome trees, near to which I had &s;topped, and &s;eized me as I lay pro&s;trate on the earth.</P>
<P>All the horrors of my &s;ituation in|&s;tantly aro&s;e to my view. The more than brutal ignorance and barbarity of tho&s;e lawle&s;s ravagers, of which I had heard too many melancholy in&s;tances, left me but little hope of favour at their hands. However, in the in&s;tinctive im|pul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, I threw my&s;elf at the feet of their leader, and embracing his knees, conjured him to take compa&s;|&s;ion on my youth, and &s;uffer me to return to an aged father, who&s;e grey hairs the lo&s;s of his only &s;on would other|wi&s;e bring with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="43">But I prayed to the winds. In&s;tead of being moved by my intreaties, the ruffian &s;purned me from him with his foot; and nodding to his followers, they in&s;tantly bound my arms, and putting me on my hor&s;e, led me away with them.</P>
<P>What I now felt, at the thought of being thus torn, probably forever, from the arms of my father, &s;ugge&s;ted to me the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, on mi&s;&s;ing me that morning. I &s;aw, tho' too late, my crime in its proper colours; I owned the ju&s;tice of heaven, in my own fate; and only grieved for the unhappine&s;s with which I had overwhelmed him.</P>
<P>But I was not &s;uffered to indulge &s;uch reflections. The rapidity, with which the ravagers hurried me along, kept my &s;pirits in involuntary motion; and the novelty of their manners excited a cu|rio&s;ity, which in &s;ome degree diverted my attention from my own di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="44">On a divi&s;ion of the captives of the expedition, I fell to the lot of the leader of the troop, by whom I was appointed to the lowe&s;t offices in his &s;qualid oeco|nomy. But I repined not. I remem|bered the words of the prophet, that <Q>the days of man are numbered; and the events of his life written on the table, which &s;tandeth before the throne of God, from the beginning of the world.</Q>&mdash;I therefore humbled my&s;elf before heaven; and &s;ubmitted without murmuring to its decrees.</P>
<P>Nor did this re&s;ignation, to the divine will, pa&s;s without reward. It was taken by my ma&s;ter for a willing acquie&s;cence under his authority; and in a &s;hort time gained me his good opinion &s;o far, that he &s;et me over the other &s;laves of his hou&s;ehold.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THE fir&s;t u&s;e which I made of my new authority, was to lighten the yoke of bondage upon my fellow-captives. They received &s;ufficient &s;u&s;tenance; their labours were &s;uited to their &s;trength and capacities; and their &s;ouls were not wounded by unmerited in&s;ult or re|proach.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence &s;oon ju&s;tified this conduct. The work of our ma&s;ter was performed to his &s;atisfaction; and he &s;lept in &s;afety among &s;laves, who had no cau&s;e to wi&s;h him evil.</P>
<P>But I was far from enjoying &s;uch happine&s;s as they &s;eemed to feel at this change of their condition. My &s;oul, impre&s;&s;ed with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of piety and virtue, was &s;hocked at &s;uch an ab|&s;ence of both, as degraded man below the level of the brutes which peri&s;h; and I trembled with fear, that the force
<PB N="26" REF="46">
of example might infect my heart, and &s;ink me down to their degenerated &s;tate. Moral virtue and religion, my father had often and mo&s;t earne&s;tly inculcated to me, are &s;o e&s;&s;entially connected, that the one cannot exi&s;t without the other. Of the truth of this maxim I had abun|dant proof in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As the revelations of the divine will, vouch&s;afed as guides to rea&s;on in mat|ters above the inve&s;tigation of its own powers, were either utterly unknown, or at lea&s;t &s;o corrupted as to bear no re&s;emblance to the &s;acred originals; &s;o were the very rules of conduct, and mutual intercour&s;e invariably imprinted by the hand of Nature on the human heart, for the mo&s;t part effaced among them. Their knowledge of a Deity was uncertain, and deba&s;ed with notions contradictory to tho&s;e principles of his e&s;&s;ence, which open them&s;elves to rea|&s;on in its fir&s;t efforts. For beneficence or gratitude they had not even a name;
<PB N="27" REF="47">
and ju&s;tice was no farther known or re|garded by them, than as it &s;erved the convenience of pre&s;erving their re&s;pec|tive property, and having that recour&s;e to force among them&s;elves by which all their di&s;agreements with others were decided.</P>
<P>Though the horrors in&s;eparable from &s;lavery, were aggravated an hundred fold under &s;uch ma&s;ters, I never lo&s;t hope; nor &s;lackened my a&s;&s;iduity in the execution of the tru&s;t committed to me. <Q>I will do my duty,</Q> &s;aid I, whenever de&s;pair began to &s;teal upon me, <Q>and depend upon the ju&s;tice of Heaven.</Q> A re&s;olution, which by keeping my thoughts employed, prevented them from brooding over my own unhap|pine&s;s, and thereby enabled me to &s;upport its weight.</P>
<P>The effects of my management &s;oon became too evident to remain unno|ticed; though my ma&s;ter, who held it
<PB N="28" REF="48">
beneath him to look &s;o low, was the la&s;t to perceive the change. Awakened at length from his inattention, he gazed around him in &s;tupid amazement; and enquiring the cau&s;e of what he &s;aw, opened his eyes and mouth into a broad &s;tare, while I explained the rea&s;ons, and in&s;tanced the advantages of my con|duct; then awkwardly relaxing his fea|tures into the fir&s;t &s;mile of complacency they had ever felt, expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething like approbation.</P>
<P>Nor did he &s;top here. He repre|&s;ented me in &s;o favourable a light to the tribe, that looking upon me now as one of them&s;elves, they admitted me to accompany them in their excur&s;ions for prey; an honour never before con|ferred upon a captive.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THOUGH &s;uch a cour&s;e of life was equally contrary to the principles in&s;tilled into me by my father, and to the di&s;po&s;ition of my own heart, the hope of one day regaining my liberty, and returning to him, which it &s;eemed to open to me, outweighed every other con&s;ideration, and &s;trengthened my hand on &s;everal occa&s;ions in &s;uch a manner as gained the approbation of my new companions.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this &s;tate, when in one of our expeditions, we happened to fall in with a caravan, &s;o numerous and well provided for de|fence, that it appeared madne&s;s in us to attack them.</P>
<P>But the pro&s;pect of rich plunder, over-balanced every thought of danger;
<PB N="30" REF="50">
and we fell upon them with the fury of wild bea&s;ts enraged by hunger, rather than like human creatures.</P>
<P>The event was &s;uch as the ra&s;hne&s;s of the attempt de&s;erved; and we were repul&s;ed, with the lo&s;s of more than half our number.</P>
<P>As I was not blinded by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions with the re&s;t of our troop, I had pre&s;ence of mind to effect our re|treat, after they had all given up every hope of it; the importance of which &s;ervice rai&s;ed me &s;o high in their opi|nion, that their leader being among the &s;lain, they conferred his po&s;t upon me.</P>
<P>This &s;eeming honour, only added anxiety to additional fatigue; for as they pay implicit obedience to the orders of their leader, during their excur&s;ions, the care of conducting which is thrown entirely upon him;
<PB N="31" REF="51">
&s;o every failure of &s;ucce&s;s is imputed to him as a crime, and expo&s;es him to wor&s;e than brutal outrage.</P>
<P>But the fa&s;cination of command, made me blind to every objection; and I entered upon my new office with all the eagerne&s;s of inexperience, encouraging my&s;elf with this reflection, that at any rate it was better to rule than to &s;erve &s;uch &s;avages: and that I &s;hould have it in my power to direct their motions to the way mo&s;t favour|able to my e&s;caping from them.</P>
<P>As I &s;aw that di&s;appointment of the plunder &s;at heavier upon the &s;urvivors than the lo&s;s of their fellows, I con&s;i|dered whether it might not &s;till be po&s;&s;ible to compa&s;s by &s;tratagem, what we had failed of by force; and revolv|ing in my mind various &s;chemes, I at length hit upon one, which proved &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="52">For &s;ome days after our defeat, we hovered about the caravan, unable to bear the thought of quitting it, and giving up our hopes, though we could &s;ee no pro&s;pect of obtaining them.</P>
<P>Having advanced thus a con&s;iderable way into the de&s;art, a &s;trong wind aro&s;e one morning, ju&s;t after the caravan had begun to march. This incident in|&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted to me, what I had hitherto wearied my thoughts in fruit|le&s;s &s;earch of.</P>
<P>Drawing our people out in a &s;ingle line, at &s;ome interval from each other, I led them above the caravan, in the wind; and galloping rapidly along, we rai&s;ed a cloud of &s;and, which the wind poured down upon them in a torrent horrible to imagination.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had reached the end of the caravan, in this manner, I turned off with the foremo&s;t of my followers,
<PB N="33" REF="53">
and taking a &s;ufficient compa&s;s, to avoid incommoding our own men, I was time enough back in the rear, to continue the line, as the la&s;t begun to move.</P>
<P>Having repeated this, as long as I thought it po&s;&s;ible for human nature to &s;upport it, we attacked them in the mid&s;t of their di&s;tre&s;s, when &s;inking under what they had &s;uffered, and con|cluding, from the manner in which I had kept up the line, that our numbers mu&s;t be many times greater than they were, they lo&s;t all &s;pirit, and made but feeble re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of victory, to prevent a car|nage, to which the inequality of num|bers unhappily gave the appearance of nece&s;&s;ity; but as &s;oon as their fury be|gan to cool, I exerted my&s;elf to put a &s;top to that, and all the other outrages, too generally offered to captives.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="54">The booty gained on this occa&s;ion was &s;o great, as for &s;ome time to &s;atisfy de&s;ires which had never known bounds before; a circum&s;tance mo&s;t favourable to my farther de&s;igns.</P>
<P>When the captives were &s;ecured, the next thing was to take mea&s;ures for our &s;afe return home, which it was far from being ea&s;y to effect, as we were liable to be attacked by the other troops of Bedouins, who range the&s;e boundle&s;s de&s;arts, and make no di&s;tinction of per&s;ons, where there is a pro&s;pect of prey.</P>
<P>As this care fell entirely upon me, I re&s;olved to execute it in &s;uch a man|ner, as to procure the liberty of as many as I could of the captives, who&s;e lives I had &s;aved. Accordingly, when all things were in readine&s;s for our march, I &s;elected tho&s;e who&s;e youth made them be&s;t able to bear the yoke of &s;lavery; and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the re&s;t

in peace, with provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for their journey: an act of humanity un|known to the Bedouins, who&s;e cu&s;tom it was to &s;lay all &s;uch captives as they thought u&s;ele&s;s to them.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;itions I made for our march, and the vigilance with which it was conducted, &s;ecured our retreat through the mid&s;t of many dangers, &s;everal troops of much &s;uperior force having met us on our way; but deceived by our appearance, they did not dare to attack us.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THOUGH the authority of the leaders of tho&s;e tribes has relation only to the conduct of their excur&s;ions, and cea&s;es at their return home, I flattered my&s;elf with a fond hope, that the great &s;ervice I had done them would procure me an influence which might enable me to do them &s;ervices &s;till greater, by
<PB N="36" REF="56">
enlightening the brutal ignorance of their minds, and humanizing their manners.</P>
<P>I was not in&s;en&s;ible of the difficulties and dangers of attacking prejudices, grown &s;acred by long u&s;e; and that ignorance, always captious, &s;eldom fails to revenge the imaginary affront of in|&s;truction; but the thought of &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o plea&s;ing, that I was not to be di&s;couraged from the attempt by any apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing, nece&s;&s;ary for accom|pli&s;hing my de&s;ign, was to &s;elect &s;ome per&s;on, on whom my in&s;tructions might be be&s;towed to be&s;t advantage, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t me by communicating the information he &s;hould receive, and re|commending it from his own experience.

<P>The only &s;cience of which the Bedou|ins had even the fainte&s;t conception, was that which regards the motions of the heavenly bodies. But though the clearne&s;s of their hemi&s;phere, and the circum&s;tance of their being obliged by the heat of the &s;un, to perform the greate&s;t part of their occupations in the night, gave them the mo&s;t favourable opportunities for pur&s;uing this &s;tudy to advantage, they had made no farther progre&s;s in it, than barely what was
<PB N="38" REF="58">
nece&s;&s;ary to direct their &s;teps through the pathle&s;s de&s;art, where they could have no land-marks to guide them in their way. On this &s;cience therefore, as that mo&s;t likely to intere&s;t their at|tention, I propo&s;ed to found my at|tempt.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I took occa&s;ion to enter into conver&s;ation with Khaled, as if accidentally, on the various appear|ances of the heavens; and beginning with the fir&s;t rudiments of the &s;cience, led him, as it were, &s;tep by &s;tep, up to the Creator of them, proving the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of his exi&s;tence from the exi&s;tence of his works; and his wi&s;dom, his power, and his goodne&s;s, from the wonderful con&s;truction, and &s;upport of them.</P>
<P>Having thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in his mind, the fir&s;t principle of religion, in the belief of a Deity, I proceeded to de|duce from thence the duties of piety,
<PB N="39" REF="59">
and moral virtue. But my endeavours, in this latter in&s;tance, were far from being attended with equal &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>While my in&s;tructions had been con|fined to matters of meer &s;peculation, he li&s;tened to me with willing attention; and not only a&s;&s;ented to truths, which interfered not with the tenour of his life, but al&s;o exerted his utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity to communicate and inculcate them to others.</P>
<P>But when he &s;aw, that an utter change in his whole conduct was to be the con|&s;equence, that pa&s;&s;ion was to be &s;ub|jected to rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice made the rule of action, no evidence, however clear and conclu&s;ive, was of force &s;uffi|cient to combat habits, plea&s;ing in practice; and as it were &s;anctified by long and general reception. On the contrary, from that moment, he with|drew his confidence from me; and I
<PB N="40" REF="60">
&s;oon found that he counteracted, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my endeavours.</P>
<P>Though I was well aware of the dif|ficulties, which this defection of Khaled threw in the way of my de&s;igns, I was too &s;anguine in the pur&s;uit to be deterred by it; and re&s;olved to try, whether I could not effect by example, what I had failed of by the force of rea&s;on; taking care to commence with &s;uch things, as from their obvious advantage in a political, as well as rectitude in a moral light, I concluded mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily command in&s;tant a&s;&s;ent.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THE lo&s;s, &s;u&s;tained in the late ex|pedition, had reduced the numbers of the tribe &s;o low, that they were obliged to remain at home, for fear of being over-powered by &s;ome of the other tribes, whom they might meet in their excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>As they were &s;en&s;ible of this di&s;ad|vantage, the &s;evere&s;t to them, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had any &s;en&s;e, I judged that an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to remedy it, mu&s;t be embraced with the greate&s;t readine&s;s and joy.</P>
<P>Though the violation of the marriage bed, was guarded again&s;t among them, by every preventive care, every terror of puni&s;hment, the female &s;ex, before that bond, was abandoned to the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s pro&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="62">Criminal as this cu&s;tom was, the me|thod taken to remedy what were looked upon to be the only bad effects of it, was &s;till a greater crime. The wretched fruits of this licentious commerce were expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in the de&s;art, without regard to the duty of paternal tender|ne&s;s, or the welfare of the community thus robbed of its &s;upport.</P>
<P>Again&s;t a practice, &s;o contradictory to nature, as well as to rea&s;on, I urged every argument which either could &s;ug|ge&s;t; and to give weight to my words, began the reformation of it among my own &s;laves, branding with a mark of infamy every female per&s;i&s;ting in pro|mi&s;cuous pro&s;titution; and obliging every male to rear, and maintain by ex|traordinary labour, every infant a&s;&s;igned to him.</P>
<P>Though, as I have before ob&s;erved, the public advantage was as obvious, as
<PB N="43" REF="63">
the private virtue of this regulation, a general outcry was in&s;tantly rai&s;ed again&s;t it. The unmarried of both &s;exes exclaimed that they were robbed of the liberties and rights of nature; and the whole tribe declared again&s;t the intoler|able tyranny and crime of &s;uch an inno|vation, which, as they alledged, would compel people to rear children again&s;t their wills; and contrary to their con|venience.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what I felt at this utter di&s;appointment of hopes, upon which I had &s;o &s;trongly &s;et my heart. I now, too late, remembered what I had often heard from my father, that <Q>though it is the duty of every per&s;on, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;tation may give influence to their ex|ample, to live according to the dictates of rea&s;on and virtue, yet a general re|formation of manners is not to be too &s;anguinely expected from the mo&s;t emi|nent example, or be&s;t concerted &s;cheme,
<PB N="44" REF="64">
if the circum&s;tances of the times are not a&s;&s;i&s;ting; but when the&s;e co-operate, the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable, and improbable means are found &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the greate&s;t ends.</Q>&mdash;But my thoughts were &s;oon diverted from the&s;e reflections, to matters of nearer concern to me.</P>
<P>The charge of making innovations in their e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, was looked upon to be &s;o atrocious a crime, that they re&s;olved in&s;tantly to put a &s;top to it, by the mo&s;t exemplary puni&s;hment, in order to deter any future pre&s;umption of the kind; for which purpo&s;e, they &s;uddenly &s;urrounded my tent, and having &s;eized me before I could attempt either defence or e&s;cape, were proceeding to drag me out of the camp, in order to &s;tone me to death, when I owed my &s;afety to a principle, from which I had never ex|pected to receive &s;o great a benefit.</P>
<P>Khaled, who had totally e&s;tranged him&s;elf from me, for &s;ome time, and
<PB N="45" REF="65">
was now become one of my loude&s;t ac|cu&s;ers, no &s;ooner perceived their inten|tion, than he ru&s;hed out of the croud, and claimed me for his &s;lave, as having been the property of his father.</P>
<P>I availed my&s;elf of the momentary check, which this claim gave to their fury, to &s;peak in my own defence. I demanded to know my crime, and my accu&s;ers. I pleaded my &s;ervices. I cal|led upon their gratitude. I argued, up|braided, and be&s;ought; but all equally in vain. My voice was drowned in the cry of <HI>innovation,</HI> which was roared from every mouth; and without deigning to make any other reply, they directly gave me up to Khaled, to return to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, from which I was deemed unworthy to be freed, &s;eizing upon my &s;laves, and every thing which belonged to me, as public property; or rather I &s;hould &s;ay, as proper objects of public rapine.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="66">As &s;oon as the croud was di&s;per&s;ed, I turned to Khaled, and thinking he had devi&s;ed this claim only to &s;ave my life, was advancing to embrace him, in te&s;ti|mony of my gratitude; but I was &s;oon undeceived. Without &s;hewing the lea&s;t concern for my misfortune, or even taking notice of ever having known me before, he ordered me to be thrown into a kind of dungeon, where they were wont to keep &s;uch &s;laves, as were found un&s;erviceable to them, till a certain &s;ea|&s;on of the year, when they di&s;po&s;ed of them, and &s;uch other parts of their &s;poil, as they had no occa&s;ion for them|&s;elves, to merchants, whom they went to meet for that purpo&s;e, in exchange for matters of more immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e occurrences were far from clear|ing up the doubts, which had been the cau&s;e of my leaving the bo&s;om of my father. On entering the dungeon, my &s;oul &s;hrunk in upon it&s;elf in horrour. <Q>If this be real life,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>better did

it appear in the mirrour of &s;peculation. More favourably was the &s;hadow to be judged of, than the &s;ub&s;tance!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>It was &s;ome happine&s;s to me however, not to be left long to the&s;e reflections. That very evening, a party of the Bedouins &s;et out to meet the merchants, and took me with them, among the other u&s;ele&s;s lumber, which they wanted to di&s;po&s;e of; when Khaled &s;hewed his proficiency in knowledge, and virtue, by the value he &s;et upon his in&s;tructor, giving me in exchange for a wallet, made of the &s;kin of an a&s;s.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THE merchant, who&s;e property I thus became, thinking he &s;aw &s;omething in my appearance, not unworthy of his favour, as &s;oon as the Arabs had con|cluded their markets, and departed, a&s;ked me in a humane manner, <Q>for what fault I had been &s;old at &s;o low a price?</Q></P>
<P>As my tongue knew no language but that of truth, I not only informed him of what he enquired, but al&s;o of the fir&s;t motive and manner of my leaving my father, and the end propo&s;ed by my travels: to all which he li&s;tened with attention; and then told me, when I had concluded, that <Q>the&s;e were mat|ters, about which he had never con|cerned him&s;elf; that all his care was to buy and &s;ell as well as he could; and that he was content to take the world as he found it, without enquiring
<PB N="49" REF="69">
farther into the actions of men, than as they might affect his own intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Contracted as the&s;e &s;entiments then appeared to me, I was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the advantage in my change of &s;ituation. My new ma&s;ter had much experience of the world, and its ways; and where a view to intere&s;t did not interfere, formed ju&s;t conclu&s;ions from what he &s;aw.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of &s;uch a man, which I enjoyed in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved intimacy, &s;weetened the bitter cup of &s;lavery, affording me plea&s;ure, and in|&s;truction, at the &s;ame time. Without attempting to trace motives, or con&s;e|quences, he related plain facts; and in them &s;upplied a kind of artificial expe|rience, unincumbered with tho&s;e di&s;|qui&s;itions, which for the greater part only ob&s;cure what they pretend to illu|&s;trate, and are more apt to mi&s;lead, than guide rea&s;on to the right way.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="70">One evening, as I was &s;itting by my|&s;elf in his tent, indulging the fond hope, which my ma&s;ter's favour &s;eemed to open to me, of returning to my father, he entered, and &s;eating him&s;elf near me, <Q>Selim,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I have ob&s;erved your demeanor ever &s;ince you have been with me, and &s;ee that your wi&s;dom much exceeds your age. I have therefore re&s;olved to con&s;ult you on an affair, which gives me much anxiety; and if your &s;entiments concur with mine, &s;hall be glad of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry them into execution.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I have followed this painful profe&s;&s;ion of a merchant, with various &s;ucce&s;s, for many years, without being ever able to acquire a &s;ufficiency for the &s;upport of old age, in comfort and decency. Often indeed, have I thought my&s;elf within &s;ight of the end of my wi&s;hes, but &s;ome unfore&s;een misfortune hath as often di&s;appointed my hopes. A re|ver&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="71">
which I have too much rea&s;on to apprehend at this time.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my pre&s;ent journey, it has been my fortune to purcha&s;e a female &s;lave, of &s;uch exqui&s;ite beauty, and rare accompli&s;hments, that I may well expect to &s;ell her to the Sultan of Cairo, whither I am now going, for &s;o high a price, as &s;hall make the re&s;t of my days happy, if her own perver&s;ene&s;s does not prevent me.</P>
<P>An invincible melancholy has preyed upon her heart, from the fir&s;t day of her coming into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. She keeps a gloomy &s;ilence, which neither threats, promi&s;es, nor intreaties can prevail upon her to break. She turns away, with di&s;gu&s;t, from every attempt made to entertain her; and the &s;u&s;te|nance &s;he takes is &s;o little, that it &s;hews &s;he wi&s;hes to &s;horten the number of her days.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="72">Such a conduct alarms me with ap|prehen&s;ions, not only of mi&s;&s;ing my expected profit, but al&s;o of lo&s;ing the great price I have given for her. A lo&s;s, which I can not bear. What I have to propo&s;e to you therefore, is that you will &s;trive to in&s;inuate your|&s;elf into her confidence; I am not in|&s;en&s;ible of the danger of &s;uch a tru&s;t; but I know your di&s;cretion, and depend upon your virtue.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect that her heart fo&s;ters &s;ome &s;ecret grief! If it could be di&s;covered, means might po&s;&s;ibly be found to ad|mini&s;ter alleviation to it, at lea&s;t. Will you then try to make this di&s;covery? The human heart finds comfort in the communication of it's woes; and if you can once engage her attention, I have no doubt, but &s;he will open her|&s;elf to you.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o uncommon in the nature of this propo&s;al, that it
<PB N="53" REF="73">
rai&s;ed a curio&s;ity I had never felt before. Totally engaged in the pur&s;uit of know|ledge, under the eye of my father, I had never had any particular intercour&s;e with the female &s;ex; nor formed any notion of that power, which nature has given them over the heart of man.</P>
<P>I had a de&s;ire therefore to &s;ee a wo|man, on whom were founded expecta|tions, which appeared to me &s;o extraor|dinary; and readily undertook a com|mi&s;&s;ion, with the dangers of which I was unacquainted; if I &s;hould not rather &s;ay, that the mention of tho&s;e dangers was my fir&s;t motive for under|taking it, as it &s;eemed to promi&s;e an opportunity of rai&s;ing my&s;elf &s;till higher in the opinion of my ma&s;ter, by my &s;urmounting them.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THE fir&s;t time I &s;aw her, &s;he was &s;itting in her tent, with her eyes fixed upon the ground, and motionle&s;s, as if the action of every &s;en&s;e was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>Struck with the &s;ight, I gazed on her, and while my eyes eagerly devoured her beauties, thought I was only &s;tudy|ing how to addre&s;s her in the manner mo&s;t likely to an&s;wer the hopes of my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I had &s;tood thus for &s;ome moments, melting in &s;en&s;ations utterly new to me, when the fair &s;lave, not having perceived my entrance, exclaimed with a &s;igh, which &s;eemed to bur&s;t her heart, <Q>Un|happy Sappho! To what new mi&s;ery am I re&s;erved?</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;ound of her voice awoke me from the exta&s;y, in which I had &s;tood
<PB N="55" REF="75">
entranced. Throwing my&s;elf eagerly at her feet, <Q>Lovely Sappho!</Q> &s;aid I, &s;eizing her hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it to my heart, <Q>unfold the cau&s;e, the nature of your unhappine&s;s, and depend upon every effort, in the power of man to make, for your relief.</Q></P>
<P>Her &s;urprize at &s;o unexpected an ad|dre&s;s deprived her of utterance for &s;ome moments. Recovering at length, <Q>In&s;i|dious man,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, tearing away her hand with indignation, <Q>to intrude upon my &s;olitude, in order to &s;teal the &s;ecrets of my &s;oul! But your ba&s;e arts &s;hall not avail! In my name, you know more, than I ever intended to di&s;cover! But more than that &s;hall you never know.</Q>&mdash;Saying which &s;he wrapped her&s;elf in her veil; and re&s;umed her &s;ilence, which my mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate en|treaties could not prevail upon her to break.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="76">This repul&s;e threw a damp upon my &s;pirits, which I knew not how to ac|count for. I was &s;urprized at what I felt. I que&s;tioned my heart, whence it could proceed; and at length re&s;olved it into my anxiety to &s;erve my ma&s;ter, heightened perhaps, as I thought, by compa&s;&s;ion for &s;o fair a creature.</P>
<P>This thought encouraged me to pro|ceed, with double a&s;&s;iduity; in the execution of the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned me. I walked be&s;ide her camel, as &s;he tra|velled, beguiling the way, with tales of entertainment; and ver&s;es, which I hourly compo&s;ed in prai&s;e of her beauty. I lulled her to &s;leep with &s;ongs of love, and con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Such a conduct could not fail to affect an heart naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of the ten|dere&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. She relaxed her re&s;erve. She received my &s;ervices with complacency; and admitted me to a familiarity, which was &s;oon improved
<PB N="57" REF="77">
into that tender kind of friend&s;hip, which can &s;ub&s;i&s;t only between the dif|ferent &s;exes.</P>
<P>As I was walking one evening, by the &s;ide of her camel, conver&s;ing with her on indifferent &s;ubjects, &s;he dropped &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urprize, at my never having &s;hewn any curio&s;ity to know who &s;he was, or by what means &s;he had been brought into her pre&s;ent unhappy &s;tate.</P>
<P>This was an opening, which I had anxiou&s;ly watched for. I replied, <Q>that far from being incurious about any thing which concerned her, my heart panted with the eagere&s;t de&s;ire to know every incident of her life, in hope of making &s;ome di&s;covery, which might &s;ugge&s;t the means of removing her unhap|pine&s;s; but that I had been kept &s;ilent by re&s;pect, and fear of awakening that grief, which I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee in &s;ome mea&s;ure beginning to &s;ub&s;ide.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="78">Thanking me for my delicacy, &s;he &s;aid with a reprehen&s;ive &s;mile, that her griefs were too deeply imprinted on her heart, ever to be forgotten; but though &s;he could not flatter her&s;elf with the fainte&s;t hope, of its being po&s;&s;ible for me to afford her relief, &s;he owed too much to my humanity to refu&s;e gratify|ing me, with the information I de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he pau&s;ed for a few minutes, to recover her &s;pirits; then wiping away a tear, which accompanied the recollection of her misfortunes, &s;he began in the&s;e words.</P></Q>

<Q><Q><P>MY name you already know. I was born in the i&s;land of Mytilene, of a family which never knew di&s;grace, be|fore I was unhappily added to it.</P>
<P>The fondne&s;s of my father viewing, in too favourable a light, the poor en|dowments be&s;towed upon me by na|ture, he &s;pared no pains to improve them, by every accompli&s;hment of education, flattering him&s;elf with the hope, that they might rai&s;e me to a more exalted rank in life, by alluring the affection of &s;ome of our young nobility, who&s;e own riches could enable them to con&s;ult inclination only in the matrimonial choice, as he had not him|&s;elf a fortune to give with me, equal to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>We often owe the di&s;appointment of our de&s;igns to the very means, upon
<PB N="60" REF="80">
which we build our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The power of plea&s;ing, in which nature was thought to have been mo&s;t liberal to me, was my voice. Fond of mu&s;ic him&s;elf, my father omitted no|thing, which could conduce to perfect me in an accompli&s;hment &s;o univer&s;ally admired. I was in&s;tructed in the u&s;e of every in&s;trument. I had ma&s;ters of every country to modulate my voice, and form my judgment, and fame &s;aid that their endeavours were not un|&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e ma&s;ters, the mo&s;t cele|brated was one, who had been educated in the &s;eraglio of the Khalif of Bag|dat. The care taken in that jealous court, to prevent the mini&s;ters of plea|&s;ure from abu&s;ing the acce&s;s, which their occupations nece&s;&s;arily give them to the female &s;ex, prevented al&s;o my father's having any apprehen&s;ion of dan|ger,
<PB N="61" REF="81">
from the familiarity of his acce&s;s to me. I practi&s;ed with him every hour, alone, in every dre&s;s and every attitude he thought proper; to try, as he pretended, which &s;uited be&s;t the powers of my voice.</P>
<P>Of all the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, that which captivates the &s;oul mo&s;t &s;trongly is mu&s;ic. By its command over the pa&s;&s;ions, it commands the heart, while it &s;ilences rea&s;on by its union with &s;enti|ment.</P>
<P>Nor is this command exerted only over the hearer. The feelings of the performer advance with his execution, till he becomes in&s;en&s;ibly the &s;lave of his own art, as I &s;oon unhappily ex|perienced.</P>
<P>The prai&s;es, which I received for my proficiency, warmed my heart with gratitude to my teacher, to who&s;e inde|fatigable a&s;&s;iduity I was &s;en&s;ible of my
<PB N="62" REF="82">
being indebted for them; and doubled my attention to his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>In vocal expre&s;&s;ion, the attitude of the body naturally accompanies the &s;en|timent. My teacher practi&s;ed this to an extreme, which I at fir&s;t thought ridiculous, and di&s;gu&s;ting. But that di&s;gu&s;t &s;oon wore off. I &s;aw him, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, only with my ears; and found &s;uch plea&s;ure in his voice, that every thing he did plea&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Such a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour could not long e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation. He perceived it too plainly; and took an advantage of it, equally ba&s;e and ab|&s;urd, to attempt improving my admi|ration of his voice into a pa&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>With this intent, whenever we prac|ti&s;ed alone together, he cho&s;e none but the mo&s;t tender themes of love for his
<PB N="63" REF="83">
le&s;&s;ons; and not content with my accompanying his voice, as before, taught me al&s;o to imitate his looks and ge&s;tures, in which he proceeded to every endearment of the pa&s;&s;ion he expre&s;&s;ed, till Nature, catching fire, realized the imitation on my heart, and I felt the flames he only acted.</P>
<P>My &s;oul had, till now, been &s;o to|tally engro&s;&s;ed by my pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic, that I had never before felt the impul&s;e of any other. Plea&s;ed therefore with &s;en&s;ations I did not un|der&s;tand, I took no pains to conceal them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage of my father, at a di&s;covery &s;o de&s;truc|tive to his hopes, &s;o fatal to his fond|ne&s;s for me. He directly turned off my teacher in the mo&s;t opprobrious manner; and loading me with every reproach of ingratitude, degeneracy,
<PB N="64" REF="84">
and folly, interdicted my ever &s;eeing him, with the &s;evere&s;t menaces.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hews the natural right of the human &s;oul to liberty &s;o &s;trongly, as the reluctancy with which it bears every &s;emblance of re&s;traint.</P>
<P>Though my heart had been warmed by the care&s;&s;es of my teacher, I was &s;o far from having a confirmed pa&s;&s;ion for him, that I knew not even what that warmth meant; and would have rejected any direct offer of love from him with indignation. But my pride was now piqued on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, by this treatment from my father; and I thought it no more than a ju&s;t a&s;&s;ertion of my liberty, to do that which he had unju&s;tly attempted to prevent my doing.</P>
<P>My teacher, who had found means to have intelligence of every thing which pa&s;&s;ed upon the occa&s;ion, &s;oon
<PB N="65" REF="85">
availed him&s;elf of this &s;pirit of liberty, (&s;hould I not rather call it contradic|tion?) which my father had rai&s;ed in me. He reque&s;ted a private interview, which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my mind I made no difficulty of granting; when pre&s;&s;ing his &s;uit with all the ardor of de&s;ire, and treating the charge of its ab&s;urdity with contempt, as a calumny devi&s;ed only to deceive my inexpe|rience, he worked up my pa&s;&s;ions, par|ticularly my re&s;entment, to &s;uch an height, that he obtained from me a promi&s;e of marriage under the &s;anction of the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows.</P></Q></Q>

<Q><Q><P>A moment's reflection &s;hewed me all the mi&s;ery into which I had plunged my&s;elf; but I was not long permitted merely to reflect upon it.</P>
<P>My promi&s;ed hu&s;band could not con|ceal his triumph over the contempt and contumely with which he had been treated by my father. The con&s;equence of this indi&s;cretion was equally &s;evere upon us both. He was thrown into the common pri&s;on, where he &s;uffered all the indignities and wretchedne&s;s of poverty and guilt among the vile&s;t male|factors, for having &s;educed a pupil, whom he had been entru&s;ted to teach for hire; while my father, in virtue of his paternal authority, confined me to my chamber, in which I was guarded with the mo&s;t rigid vigilance, and de|nied every thing like plea&s;ure, or even comfort; in order to puni&s;h me for my
<PB N="67" REF="87">
pa&s;t di&s;obedience, and bend me to his purpo&s;e of breaking the engagement into which I had entered.</P>
<P>But this &s;everity di&s;appointed it&s;elf, and only hardened my re&s;olution into ob&s;tinacy. Though I &s;aw all the wretch|edne&s;s I had to expect, with &s;uch a hu&s;band, in a life of vagrant poverty, dependance and di&s;grace, I dreaded &s;till more the &s;coffs of my acquaintance, and the bad treatment of my family, of which I had already ta&s;ted &s;o bit|terly, &s;hould I remain among them.</P>
<P>I therefore determined to feign a pa&s;&s;ion which I did not feel, as the only excu&s;e for my folly; and take my fate, however hard, among &s;tran|gers, away from the &s;lights and re|proaches of my friends.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, a pa&s;&s;ion which I did not feel. For upon examining my heart, I found in it none of that enthu&s;ia&s;m,
<PB N="68" REF="88">
that madne&s;s of love, which is de|&s;cribed as delighting in dangers, and &s;weetening di&s;tre&s;s. I found it had been the mu&s;ic I had loved, not the man; and that the connection between them had even le&s;&s;ened that love. I had dreamed of happine&s;s, but I awoke to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>My ob&s;tinacy at length &s;o effectually weaned me from my father's love, that he ca&s;t me off from his care, and aban|doned me to my fate; when the fir&s;t u&s;e I made of my liberty was to fly to my teacher, and perform my pro|mi&s;e of marriage, amid all the horrors of his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Formed by nature for love, the hu|man heart &s;ympathizes in&s;tinctively in the misfortunes too often occa&s;ioned by it. This act of mine had &s;uch an ap|pearance of the infatuation of that pa&s;|&s;ion, that it moved the pity of all who were not immediately intere&s;ted in the
<PB N="69" REF="89">
honour of my family; and my hu&s;band found protectors, who &s;oon re&s;tored him to liberty.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation, however, &s;eemed to be but little amended. We were at liberty to go whither we li&s;ted; but we wanted the means; and to remaining where we were, could we even have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted there, I would have preferred peri&s;hing of famine in any other place.</P>
<P>At length the cold hand of charity, &s;cantily enabled us to travel to the me|tropolis; where curio&s;ity to hear a voice, which had had power to invert the laws of nature, for &s;ome little time drew &s;uch crowds to my hu&s;band's per|formances, that we were relieved from the immediate pre&s;&s;ure of poverty.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t dearly did I purcha&s;e this relief. The curio&s;ity of the public was not confined to my hu&s;band. They mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee the &s;ubject of his triumph;
<PB N="70" REF="90">
the fool, who had &s;acrificed &s;en&s;e to &s;ound. Every one, who patronized, a&s;&s;umed a right to vi&s;it him. I was &s;hewn from morning till night, to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;trangers, who broke in at all hours, without re&s;pect or cere|mony; and gazed at me with as much indelicacy and in&s;olence, as if I had been a mon&s;ter exhibited to &s;ight for hire.</P>
<P>Nor did I &s;uffer from their gazing only. They in&s;ulted me ince&s;&s;antly, with &s;uch ribbald que&s;tions, and &s;uch ba&s;e propo&s;als, as were an outrage upon the female character: and when I ven|tured to expre&s;s di&s;approbation of their behaviour, though in the mo&s;t humble terms, they treated my tears with ridi|cule; and threatened to puni&s;h me for &s;uch pre&s;umptuous affectation, as they gibingly called it, by withdrawing their favour from my hu&s;band.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="91">Much as I was humbled in my own eyes, my &s;pirit was not yet &s;ufficiently &s;ubdued to &s;ubmit to &s;uch u&s;age. I complained to my hu&s;band, in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul; and declared my re&s;olution to &s;hut my&s;elf up from the &s;ight of the world, rather than &s;uffer a repetition of it.</P>
<P>But I was far from receiving the ap|probation of my conduct, much le&s;s the protection I expected from him. He an&s;wered me coldly, that my &s;en&s;i|bilities were too lively, and took unne|ce&s;&s;ary offence; that what I complained of was merely a thing of cour&s;e; that we mu&s;t humour the caprices of tho&s;e, by who&s;e favour we lived; and that other women, in&s;tead of being offended by the propo&s;als made to me, would have turned them to good advantage, as they were indeed one of the be&s;t re&s;ources in our way of life.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="92">It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what I felt on his &s;aying this. I thought I had before &s;een all the horrors of my &s;itua|tion; but the&s;e words opened new, of which I had not had the remote&s;t conception; and betrayed the infa|mous origin of all his ba&s;e de&s;igns upon me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fullne&s;s of my heart permitted me to &s;peak, I an&s;wered him with a look of the mo&s;t poignant di&s;|dain, <Q>that what he meant by <HI>his</HI> way of life, I knew not, nor de&s;ired to know; but that <HI>mine,</HI> though a life of folly and misfortune, had ever been, and ever &s;hould be, a life of virtue and honour, nor would I add to the di&s;|grace I had already brought upon my family, by departing from tho&s;e prin|ciples, to &s;ave my&s;elf from peri&s;hing of famine, as I ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</Q>&mdash; Saying which, I retired to my cham|ber; nor could all his expo&s;tulations,
<PB N="73" REF="93">
menaces, or entreaties, ever prevail upon me to alter my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity which our &s;trange ad|venture had rai&s;ed, was no &s;ooner gra|tified, than my hu&s;band's voice lo&s;t its attraction; and we &s;unk back into our former di&s;tre&s;s; for &s;uch a &s;lave was he to the appetites which he could indulge, that he always lavi&s;hed his acqui&s;itions in the in&s;tant; nor ever let the wants of ye&s;terday, warn him to make provi&s;ion for the morrow.</P>
<P>I was now obliged to fly my native country, and enter upon a life of va|grancy, literally for a mor&s;el of bread; without the illu&s;ion of hope, or gratifi|cation of pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ilence the reproaches of rea&s;on, and divert my thoughts from dwelling upon the wretchedne&s;s into which I had plunged my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was the &s;ame wherever we went. Curio&s;ity, for he took care to
<PB N="74" REF="94">
make my folly known, at fir&s;t procured us momentary relief, which was as quickly di&s;&s;ipated; &s;o that we were always in the extremes of poverty or profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>My only &s;hadow of &s;atisfaction was, that my hu&s;band de&s;i&s;ted from his ba&s;e &s;ollicitations; in expectation, as I &s;oon &s;aw, that the conver&s;ation of &s;uch com|pany, of either &s;ex, as I was obliged to con&s;ort with, would in time under|mine my principles, and reconcile me to enter willingly into all their ways.</P>
<P>But his nece&s;&s;ities &s;oon became too urgent, to permit his waiting for an effect, of which he thought him&s;elf &s;o &s;ecure; and he compleated the villainy of his fir&s;t &s;eduction, by &s;elling me for a &s;lave to this merchant.</P>
<P>My re&s;entment, as the ba&s;e wretch never dared to &s;ee me more, fell ju&s;tly upon my&s;elf; and I re&s;olved to &s;horten

the days of my mi&s;ery gradually, by ab&s;tinence, as the lea&s;t painful way. But your kind con&s;olations have &s;haken that re&s;olution.

<Q><P>WHEN the fair &s;lave had fini&s;hed, I left her to recover her &s;pirits, which appeared to be exhau&s;ted by the length and nature of her &s;tory; and upon con&s;idering the circum&s;tances of it, I thought I had found the object of my &s;earch, in the &s;ource of her misfortunes. <Q>All the evil in this world, all the errors in the conduct of man,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>cer|tainly proceed from wrong education. How could &s;he e&s;cape the &s;nare, into which &s;he was led by tho&s;e, whom Na|ture and Rea&s;on taught her to look
<PB N="76" REF="96">
upon as her &s;afe&s;t guides? With what colour of ju&s;tice could her father blame her, for a conduct which was the nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence of his own indi&s;cre|tion? From wrong education certainly proceed all the evils which deform human life.</Q></P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed with this di&s;covery; and plumed my&s;elf not a little upon the &s;aga|city which had made it. But my exul|tation la&s;ted not long.</P>
<P><Q>But if her father's indi&s;cretion,</Q> I continued on farther reflection, <Q>was the cau&s;e of her fir&s;t error, was his exertion of the &s;acred right of paternal authority, a ju&s;t cau&s;e for per&s;i&s;ting in that error? For aggravating it by di|rect di&s;obedience to his ju&s;t command? Did this indi&s;cretion of the father, in giving his daughter &s;o wrong an educa|tion&mdash;Did the villainy of the hu&s;band in ba&s;ely &s;elling into &s;lavery the victim of his ba&s;e &s;eduction, proceed from
<PB N="77" REF="97">
errors in their education al&s;o?&mdash;There is more in this matter than I was aware of. I &s;hould be acquainted with every particular, to be able to form a ju&s;t judgment of the whole.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And even, if I knew all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, is it &s;afe to extend a judg|ment formed upon one event, or one &s;eries of events, to the infinitely varied tenor of human life? I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend my opinion, till I &s;hall have &s;een far|ther into the interior principles on which it is conducted. A wrong education is certainly the &s;ource of many evils; but it is not equally certain, that it is the &s;ource of all.</Q></P>
<P>Though many circum&s;tances in the &s;tory of the fair &s;lave had nece&s;&s;arily lowered her in my opinion, they &s;eemed to have a contrary effect upon my heart. To the compa&s;&s;ion which I had before felt for her &s;ufferings, was now added a de&s;ire to correct the errors from which
<PB N="78" REF="98">
they &s;prung; a ta&s;k which I flattered my&s;elf would be as ea&s;y as plea&s;ing, from the candor with which &s;he had con|fe&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Happy in this thought, I entered abruptly, at our next meeting, into tho&s;e particulars, in which I thought &s;he had been mo&s;t to blame; and exa|mining them clo&s;ely, proved by argu|ments more conclu&s;ive than complai&s;ant, that all her misfortunes had proceeded from her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Though her looks &s;ufficiently &s;hewed that this &s;ubject was far from being plea&s;ing to her, &s;he heard me to the end, without interruption; when in&s;tead of making any reply to the purpo&s;e of what I had been &s;aying, &s;he hummed a tune for a few minutes, and then a&s;ked me, if I had heard whether the &s;ultan was fond of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="99">So contemptuous a repul&s;e embarra&s;&s;ed me &s;o much, that it was &s;ome time be|fore I could make her any an&s;wer. At length, bowing coldly, I told her, that the &s;ultan's ta&s;te was one of the&s;e &s;ecrets of the &s;eraglio, with which the voice of fame pre&s;umed not to meddle: adding, with a &s;ignificant &s;mile, that I had plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the hopes of turn|ing her attention to objects more worthy of it.</P>
<P>She &s;aw my embarra&s;&s;ment, and &s;eemed unwilling to encrea&s;e it. <Q>Your inten|tion,</Q> &s;he an&s;wered, <Q>did not e&s;cape my notice; but I cannot accommodate my&s;elf to it. You have drawn &s;o favour|able a picture of the life led in the &s;eraglio, that I have fixed my heart upon entering into it. If the &s;ultan is fond of mu&s;ic, I have no fear but I &s;hall gain his favour. Such a conque&s;t only can compen&s;ate for my pa&s;t mis|fortunes; and I would attempt it to|morrow, if I were at liberty, and able
<PB N="80" REF="100">
to follow my own inclinations. Any advice therefore, which you can give me to accompli&s;h this, I &s;hall receive with gratitude. To any other purpo&s;e it will be in vain for you to ad|vi&s;e me.</Q></P>
<P>So peremptory a declaration effectu|ally &s;ilenced me. I bowed my head re&s;pectfully, and left her, without &s;ay|ing another word, re&s;olved never to think of her more.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that the only way to fulfil this re&s;olution was to avoid her company. I therefore told the mer|chant what &s;he had &s;aid to me, who thanked me in the warme&s;t terms for the &s;ervice I had done him, in reconciling her to his views; and acquie&s;ced in my opinion, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary for me to continue my vi&s;its to her.</P>
<P>Such a &s;acrifice to rea&s;on was not un|attended with pain; nor am I certain
<PB N="81" REF="101">
that I could have per&s;i&s;ted in my re&s;o|lution, but that our arrival at Cairo produced &s;uch an unexpected change in my &s;ituation, that if the remembrance of the fair &s;lave would at times force it&s;elf upon me, it &s;oon gave place to other objects.</P></Q>
<P><Q>How unju&s;t is the pride of &s;pecula|tive wi&s;dom,</Q> interrupted the emperor. <Q>You were offended at her, becau&s;e &s;he would not li&s;ten to advice &s;he could not follow. What could &s;he think of, but improving a fate, which &s;he could &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding? In reality, it was you who gave cau&s;e of offence. Impracticable advice is only in&s;ult to the unfortunate.&mdash;</Q></P>
<Q>But &s;top! The appearance of the morning calls my attention to other matters. I have not lei&s;ure to li&s;ten to thee longer now. At &s;ome other time, my curio&s;ity may po&s;&s;ibly require

the continuation of thy &s;tory. In the mean while, remain at thy liberty among my attendants; and &s;et thine heart at ea&s;e. Thou art not now among the Bedouins.</Q>

<P>SOME days pa&s;&s;ed before Temugin could attend to the continuation of the captive's &s;tory; but his curio&s;ity, though re&s;trained, was far from being &s;atisfied. The fir&s;t evening he could &s;pare from his weightier cares, he commanded his atten|dance; when he re&s;umed his narrative, in the&s;e words.</P>
<Q><PB N="84" REF="104"><P>From the general tenour of the mer|chant's conver&s;ation, I had been led to think his principles &s;trictly ju&s;t, and generous to the be&s;t of his conception; but I &s;oon found that the difference be|tween &s;peculation and practice is equally great, in every &s;tation of life. On the third day, after our arrival at Cairo, he fulfilled his profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, and gratitude for the &s;ervice I had done him, by &s;elling me as a &s;lave to the grand vi&s;ier.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, in ju&s;tice to him, omit a particular circum&s;tance, which happened on this occa&s;ion. When he was delivering me to the vi&s;ier, he told me, as an excu&s;e of his di&s;appoint|ing the hopes of liberty, which he had always given me, that it had not been his intention to &s;ell me, but the vi&s;ier, who had been plea&s;ed with &s;omething in my appearance, offered him &s;o high a price, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly refrain from accepting it; <Q>for you know, he
<PB N="85" REF="105">
concluded, that it is a rule with us, who live by buying and &s;elling, never to refu&s;e a good offer.</Q></P>
<P>This excu&s;e took effect, though not in the manner it was intended. It gave me &s;uch a contempt for the man, who made it, that I left him with plea&s;ure, though to continue in &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The accounts which I had received from my father of the perfection, to which every power of human art and genius had been carried in Egypt, had rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity &s;o high to &s;ee the country, that I almo&s;t forgot the wretch|ed &s;tate, in which I went thither. But how was my expectation di&s;appointed! The ruins of ancient magnificence only made pre&s;ent mi&s;ery the more remarkable. The rulers prided them&s;elves in brutal violence, in the de&s;truction of works they could not imitate; and the con|tempt of &s;ciences above their compre|hen&s;ion. The people, a mixture of that
<PB N="86" REF="106">
draff of all nations, who de&s;titute of principle or &s;entiment, ramble from their native homes, and &s;ubmit to all the in|&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ion of foreign tyranny for the &s;ordid &s;ake of &s;craping up wealth, which they dare not enjoy, had neither lei&s;ure, genius, nor &s;pirit to cultivate either art or &s;cience.</P>
<P>My &s;oul &s;ickened in the contempla|tion of &s;uch degeneracy. I would have preferred returning to the Bedouins in the de&s;art, to remaining in a country, once the pride of nature, had I been ma&s;ter of my&s;elf. There was a po&s;&s;i|bility at lea&s;t that tho&s;e &s;avages might be reclaimed in time; but here, every thing was evidently growing wor&s;e; nor could imagination &s;et bounds to their fall, when the height, from which they had already fallen, was con&s;idered.</P>
<P>But I was &s;oon delivered from the pain of &s;uch contemplations. In le&s;s than a moon, after I was &s;old to the
<PB N="87" REF="107">
vi&s;ier, he was depo&s;ed, and &s;trangled; and all his property confi&s;cated to the u&s;e of the &s;ultan.</P>
<P>In the di&s;&s;ipation, u&s;ual on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, it fell to my lot, to be given to an officer, who was &s;ent the very next morning to execute a like &s;entence, on Almanzor, the brother of the late vi&s;ier, who commanded the Egyptian army on the confines of Biledulgerid, and took me in his train.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of his commi&s;&s;ion, that he &s;hould execute it, before the fate of the late vi&s;ier &s;hould come to the knowledge of his brother, to put him on his guard, as his great abilities and virtues had endeared him &s;o highly to his troops, that they would, to a man, have defended his life, with their own, we traver&s;ed the inho&s;pitable de&s;art of Barca, with the utmo&s;t expe|dition.</P></Q>

<Q><P>ON the fourth morning of our jour|ney, as we &s;at upon the bank of a river, to refre&s;h nature after &s;o &s;evere a fatigue, we were &s;urprized at the &s;ight of a troop, which came pouring down upon us, from every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of univer&s;al war, in which we knew the rovers of tho&s;e de&s;arts live with all mankind, left us no room to doubt of their intentions; at the &s;ame time, that their numbers &s;hewed it was in vain to attempt re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, there was not a moment to deliberate. I &s;prung in&s;tantly upon my hor&s;e, whom I had learned from the Bedouins never to quit; and calling to all tho&s;e, who preferred death to &s;lavery, to follow me, I plunged into the river: But not above three or four

followed my example; the re&s;t, &s;tupe|fied by the affright, and fond of life, even in its mo&s;t abject &s;tate, not daring to make &s;o de&s;perate an effort to pre&s;erve their liberty.</P>
<P>The rapidity of the &s;tream hurried me away, with a violence which &s;oon di|verted my attention from every thing, but the immediate danger of my life. Thrice was I &s;wallowed in the whirl|pools, which foamed among the rocks, that broke the current of the river; but the &s;trength and &s;pirit of my hor&s;e, to whom I clung in the in&s;tinctive impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, after I had lo&s;t &s;en&s;e of every thing el&s;e, bore me through to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore.</P>
<P>When I had recovered my&s;elf a little, and returned thanks to heaven, for &s;o &s;ignal a mercy; I looked wi&s;hfully around for my companions, but all in vain. However as I had been borne by the

torrent, out of the view of the enemy, I lingered awhile on the bank, to &s;ee if they might not happily have gained &s;ome other part; till at length lo&s;ing every &s;hadow of &s;uch hope, and growing ap|prehen&s;ive, that the rovers might find &s;ome &s;afer place to pa&s;s the river, and pur&s;ue me, I turned about, and plunged into the pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s, ignorant whither to direct my &s;teps.</P>
<P>I proceeded thus, guided only by de|&s;pair, till the approach of night, when the roaring of the various bea&s;ts i&s;&s;uing from their dens in &s;earch of prey, warned me to provide for the &s;afety of the pre&s;ent moment, however dreadful the farther pro&s;pect, which lay before me. Accord|ingly fa&s;tening my hor&s;e to the root of a lofty tree, I climbed its &s;ummit, and imploring the divine protection, di&s;po&s;ed my&s;elf to re&s;t among the branches, in the be&s;t manner &s;uch a &s;ituation would admit.</P>

<P>At the approach of morning, when my &s;en&s;es were refre&s;hed, and the facul|ties of my mind had recovered their vigour, I &s;aw a vi&s;ion, and in the power of imagination beheld the &s;ame cele&s;tial being, which had appeared to me, in my dream, the morning before I left the hou&s;e of my father.</P>
<P><Q>Selim,</Q> methought he &s;aid, regarding me with a look of reprehen&s;ion, <Q>from thine own pre&s;umptuous folly have ari&s;en thy misfortunes. Let experience teach thee wi&s;dom.

<P>My vi&s;ion was broken off, as he &s;poke the&s;e words, by a mo&s;t tremendous noi&s;e, at which I in&s;tantly awoke; when the fir&s;t object I &s;aw was an huge-lion, which had ju&s;t &s;eized upon my hor&s;e, and was tearing him piece-meal.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s, with which I was affected at this &s;ight, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. The &s;en&s;e of my dreadful &s;ituation, deprived thus of my be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to traver&s;e tho&s;e boundle&s;s wilds, was heightened by gratitude to the noble creature, which had &s;o lately &s;aved my life.

tempted by de&s;pair to precipitate my&s;elf upon him, and either revenge, or &s;hare his fate.</P>
<P>But a recollection of the words, which I had ju&s;t heard in my vi&s;ion, prevented my being guilty of &s;uch ra&s;hne&s;s. I con&s;idered that the dangers, which made my pre&s;ent pro&s;pect &s;o terrifying, were yet le&s;s immediately terrible, than tho&s;e which I had &s;o lately e&s;caped; and gathering hope from thence, I implored a continuance of the divine protection, and re&s;igned my&s;elf with humility to the di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven.</P>
<P>This re&s;tored my mind to &s;ome &s;e|renity, and enabled me to con&s;ider, which way I &s;hould direct my cour&s;e, as &s;oon as the departure of the lion &s;hould permit me to de&s;cend from my place of &s;afety; but &s;o many ob&s;tacles pre&s;ented them&s;elves on every &s;ide, that rea&s;on could find no hope, whereon to form a choice.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="114">In this perplexity, it occurred to me at length to pur&s;ue the journey, in which I had been engaged; and &s;trive to join, if po&s;&s;ible, the army of Almanzor, though with a different intention from that with which I had been &s;ent.</P>
<P>No re&s;olution, which was not ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible, could have been at|tended with greater difficulties. I had &s;till an immen&s;e tract of this inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s to traver&s;e. I knew not my way through it. I knew not even where the army of Almanzor lay.

I &s;oon awoke, and rai&s;ing my eyes, what was my a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee a being, who&s;e ap|pearance was &s;uch as mu&s;t &s;trike the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible heart with awe.

<P>My heart almo&s;t died within me, at the &s;ight. I was &s;en&s;ible that I was awake; and wanted that intrepidity, with which &s;leep prepares us to behold its own creatures.

<P>It was a circular building of va&s;t ex|tent, the walls of which had been &s;o high, that though a great part of them was fallen, in &s;everal places, that which remained &s;tanding, was &s;till &s;ufficient to exclude every creature, without wings: nor could I perceive a place of entrance, for any other, as he led me all around it.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t going to expre&s;s my &s;ur|prize at this, when my conductor

<P>I found my&s;elf, now, in a large gal|lery, arched over-head, and &s;upported by ma&s;&s;y pillars, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip.

<P>When I had indulged my curio&s;ity for &s;ome minutes, in gazing at objects &s;o new to me, we de&s;cended into a &s;pacious apartment, under the gallery; in the middle of which there aro&s;e a fountain, that filled a bath of the white&s;t marble;

<P>When I had purified and refre&s;hed my|&s;elf, after my fatigue, he led me back into the gallery, where &s;he had laid for us, a variety of fruits, &s;ome dried in the &s;un, and others fre&s;h-plucked from the trees, with a va&s;e of living water, ju&s;t drawn from the fountain.</P>
<P>My ho&s;t, having thanked heaven for its ble&s;&s;ings, reached me &s;ome of the fruits; and encouraged me to eat by his example.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied the cravings of na|ture; and being in &s;ome degree re|lieved by his beneficence, from the awe, with which his appearance had &s;truck me, I began to recover my &s;pirits; and look around me, with le&s;s embar|ra&s;&s;ment.</P>

<P>Misfortune had &s;oftened the minds of this new people; and taught them all tho&s;e duties of humanity, which are too often neglected in the high blood of a pro&s;perous e&s;tate.

<Q><P>WHEN all things were &s;ettled in this pro&s;perous cour&s;e, Narbal, who&s;e views were too exten&s;ive to be confined to the pre&s;ent moment, a&s;&s;embled his whole people; and laying before them the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of their affairs, re&s;igned into their hands the authority with which they had entru&s;ted him; advi&s;ing them to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome permanent form of government, which might give a rational hope of &s;ecuring the continuance of their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But they, who had learned wi&s;dom in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, were not to be tempted by any allurements of power, to forego the advantages which they ex|perienced under his care. They not only refu&s;ed to accept his re&s;ignation, but in the warmth of their gratitude and confidence, offered to chu&s;e him directly for their king.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="140">Though this far out-went the intention of Narbal, he thought proper to accede in appearance to their propo&s;al for the pre&s;ent, as the method for accompli&s;h|ing the great de&s;ign he had in view; but declined actually receiving the crown, till he &s;hould make &s;ome preparations, which he e&s;teemed nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o &s;olemn a ceremony.</P>
<P>The opportunities Narbal had had of comparing the various forms of govern|ment, in all the various countries thro' which he had travelled, having enabled him to di&s;cover the defects and advan|tages in each, he directly applied him|&s;elf with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity and atten|tion, to &s;elect from all, &s;uch particular parts, as when dige&s;ted into one con|&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem, might be mo&s;t likely to procure the happine&s;s of the community, the great end of all government, in the purity of its original intention.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="141">When he had compleated his de&s;ign, he again convened the people, on a mount which aro&s;e in the mid&s;t of the city; and having offered up &s;acrifices and prayers to the gods, to be propi|tious to his undertaking, the mo&s;t vene|rable of the elders informed them of the cau&s;e of their being a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>An univer&s;al bur&s;t of joyful acclama|tion te&s;tifying their a&s;&s;ent, Narbal ad|vanced to the altar, and waving his hand to demand attention, declared with a determined look and accent, that as he was come there that day, to take upon him the government of the &s;tate, at their reque&s;t, not by his own de&s;ire, he expected they would permit him to explain the terms, on which alone it was his invariable re&s;olution to enter upon that equally difficult and impor|tant charge.</P>

<P>Ju&s;tly &s;en&s;ible that the pro&s;perity of a &s;tate is nece&s;&s;arily derived from and dependent on the favour of heaven, he ordained, that all the &s;acred rites of religion &s;hould be con&s;tantly performed with piety and proper order; and to enable the per&s;ons &s;et apart for the per|formance of them to attend to that

<P>The mi&s;eries which he had invariably &s;een the people groan under, in tho&s;e countries where the prince knows no law but his own will, and executes that law him&s;elf, over-balanced every temp|tation

with which power could a&s;&s;ail his generous heart, and determined him again&s;t a form of government, where greatne&s;s is purcha&s;ed at &s;o dear a price; as on the other hand, he had before his eyes, in the unhappy fate of his native country, a melancholy proof of the evils attending tho&s;e governments, in which the &s;upreme power is lodged &s;olely in the collective body of the people, who&s;e councils are too often dictated by caprice or intrigue, and who&s;e motions, where the object is not in&s;tantly pre&s;ent, are as &s;low and feeble, as their re&s;olutions are precipitate and ra&s;h.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two extremes, the wi&s;|dom of Narbal cho&s;e a mean, in which he hoped to avoid the evils incident to both.</P>
<P>To give dignity and vigour to the &s;tate, he ordained, that it &s;hould be governed by a king; as he al&s;o ordained, that the crown &s;hould de&s;cend by regu|lar
<PB N="125" REF="145">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion in one family, to obviate the fatal con&s;equences which attend the &s;truggles of ambition; being too well read in the human heart, to tru&s;t the people with the right of chu&s;ing their &s;overeign on every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; a right ine&s;timable in its fir&s;t principle, where rea&s;on directs the choice to merit only, but liable to &s;uch abu&s;e in the practice, as over-balances every advantage.</P>
<P>To prevent the abu&s;e of power, when thus rendered hereditary and certain, he appointed limits to the authority of the crown, by laws which a&s;certained the rights of the people; which laws were to be acknowledged by every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeign, on his a&s;cending the throne; and his ob&s;ervation of them made the condition of the people's obedience.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;overeign with their ad|vice, in the arduous affairs of govern|ment, he in&s;tituted a council compo&s;ed of the elders and chiefs of the Cartha|ginian
<PB N="126" REF="146">
families, who had been the com|panions of his flight, to whom he joined a few of the natives, mo&s;t eminent for their virtue, to obviate any apprehen|&s;ion, that their intere&s;ts might be &s;acri|ficed to tho&s;e of their new fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>That this council &s;hould not be &s;ub|ject to the influences of fear or merce|nary motives, he appointed them &s;everal honourable and important privileges, and con&s;igned to each a con&s;iderable property out of the public &s;tock, which privilege and property were to de&s;cend to their po&s;terity, who were to be the hereditary coun&s;ellors of the king, and guardians of the laws, &s;o long as they per&s;evered in the principles of private as well as public virtue, for which they were rai&s;ed to &s;uch honour; but on their falling off from them, or di&s;&s;ipating the property thus given to &s;ecure their inde|pendance, all tho&s;e advantages were to be forfeited, their families reduced to a
<PB N="127" REF="147">
private rank, and their places filled with per&s;ons more worthy of them.</P>
<P>Le&s;t this preeminence &s;hould tempt this hereditary council to infringe upon the authority of the &s;overeign, or join him in oppre&s;&s;ing the people, above whom they were thus rai&s;ed, Narbal in&s;tituted a &s;econd council, inferior in rank, to be cho&s;en annually by the people from among them&s;elves, to watch over their intere&s;ts, and defeat any at|tempt which might be made either by the &s;overeign, or the &s;uperior council, to exceed the limits re&s;pectively ap|pointed to them; which &s;econd council was to be convened at a certain time in every year, to examine pa&s;t tran&s;actions, and concert future mea&s;ures; during their attendance on which duties, they were to enjoy the &s;ame privileges as the &s;uperior council; but at the end of that attendance, to return to their former private &s;tate; and this &s;hort duration of their authority was ordained, that in ca&s;e

this repre&s;entative council, or any of its members, &s;hould deviate from the &s;en&s;e of their con&s;tituents, or betray their confidence, the people might have a timely remedy in their power, by cor|recting their choice; and entru&s;ting their rights into more faithful hands, before any evil or error committed by them &s;hould take too deep a root.</P>
<P>By the&s;e two councils, in conjunction with the &s;overeign, were to be framed all future laws for the government of the &s;tate, as well in its interior policy, as in re&s;pect to its connections and inter|cour&s;e with other &s;tates; which con|junction was &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that the di&s;&s;ent of the &s;overeign, or either council, pre|vented the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the law pro|po&s;ed: and of all laws, the execution was committed to the king, with a power of appointing per&s;ons proper for that purpo&s;e; but under this re&s;triction, that no per&s;on &s;hould be appointed to
<PB N="129" REF="149">
execute the laws, who was him&s;elf known to per&s;i&s;t in the violation of any law.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, to &s;upport the dignity of the crown, and defray the nece&s;&s;ary ex|pences of the &s;tate, he appointed a cer|tain portion of lands to be cultivated by &s;uch delinquents, as by their crimes &s;hould de&s;erve the lo&s;s of liberty; being &s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity and inju&s;tice to the public, of depriving it of the &s;ervice of its members, by puni&s;hing any crime, be&s;ide murder, with the death of the criminal; and that as all other crimes proceed ultimately from idlene&s;s, their proper puni&s;hment is labour, the appre|hen&s;ion of which accumulated as far as the &s;trength of the criminal could po&s;|&s;ibly &s;upport, and continued for his life, mu&s;t be much more effectual to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch crimes, than any other puni&s;hment, however &s;evere, but of &s;hort duration; and till there &s;hould be a &s;ufficient number of &s;uch delinquents, or if happily there never &s;hould, then

by the lower ranks of the people for hire, to be paid out of the produce of their labour.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of government it was impo&s;&s;ible to make any objection.

<Q><P>THE &s;ame wi&s;dom and public &s;pirit which had dictated this form of govern|ment, appeared in every act of Narbal's reign. He promoted virtue, and pu|ni&s;hed vice. He &s;ecured the civil rights and private property of his &s;ubjects, by plain and equitable laws. He e&s;tabli&s;hed order in the &s;tate; and regulated its in|ternal policy. He re&s;trained o&s;tentatious expence, luxury, and exce&s;s. He en|couraged indu&s;try, and application to the u&s;eful arts; and his own conduct was the be&s;t comment on his laws.</P>
<P>When he had &s;ettled the&s;e mo&s;t im|mediate objects of his care, he extended it to others more remote, though not le&s;s important.</P>
<P>He knew that indu&s;try is the true parent of &s;trength; and commerce the only inexhau&s;tible fund of wealth to a
<PB N="132" REF="152">
&s;tate: but he had learned from the un|happy fate of Carthage, that even com|merce may be pur&s;ued too far, and that exce&s;s of wealth is weakne&s;s. He there|fore directed the &s;pirit of indu&s;try to a more &s;olid object.</P>
<P>Of all the ways, in which the com|bined force of the human mind and body can be exerted, the mo&s;t advan|tageous, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t truly honourable, is agriculture. It creates that wealth, which commerce only collects: it &s;upports the arts, by &s;upporting life for the exerci&s;e of them: it increa&s;es population, and provides for that encrea&s;e. In a word, as much as the &s;upply of natural, is more important than that of artificial wants; as much as life it&s;elf, than the phanta&s;tic emolu|ments of it, by &s;o much is agriculture &s;uperior to every other art: and for this rea&s;on, the fir&s;t and great aim of Nar|bal's policy, through the whole cour&s;e of his reign, was to improve agriculture,
<PB N="133" REF="153">
and promote it by every encouragement of intere&s;t and honour.</P>
<P>Nor was his care confined within the circle of his own kingdom. He &s;tudied the genius and intere&s;ts of all the neigh|bouring nations; and laid down rules for the conduct proper to be ob&s;erved in every po&s;&s;ible intercour&s;e with them.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t aim of Narbal's po|licy was peace, and his fir&s;t laws calcu|lated for the cultivation of it, he was too well acquainted with human nature to expect that &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing could be pre|&s;erved to his people without the &s;upport of force, to repel the attacks of envy, intere&s;t, and ambition.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h this force therefore, in con&s;tant readine&s;s for &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a pur|po&s;e, he ordained that all the Byr&s;an youth &s;hould learn the warlike arts, and appear at certain &s;tated times in every year before him, to &s;hew their expert|ne&s;s
<PB N="134" REF="154">
at them; encouraging emulation by honorary prizes; but at the &s;ame time taking every po&s;&s;ible precaution to &s;uppre&s;s ambition and an indi&s;criminate pa&s;&s;ion for war.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of the&s;e in&s;titutions &s;oon appeared. His people were held in e&s;teem and re&s;pect by all the neighbour|ing nations. They were happy in them|&s;elves; and their country flouri&s;hed in all the ble&s;&s;ings of indu&s;try and peace; and as far as human rea&s;on could look forward into time, the firmne&s;s of the ba&s;is upon which his happine&s;s was founded, &s;ecured its duration.</P></Q>
<P><Q>But why do I dwell thus fondly on the excellencies of a government, which is now no more? The theme mu&s;t be di&s;intere&s;ting to you; but my mind is &s;o filled with the revered idea, that in the over-flowing of my heart, I have in&s;en&s;ibly ran into lengths, beyond my

<P><Q>HEAVEN,</Q> continued my ho&s;t, <Q>re|warded the virtue of Narbal, in the ample&s;t manner. He &s;aw all his pious labours crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; and died full of years, and full of glory, leaving his crown to a &s;on, worthy to &s;ucceed him.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The kingdom of Byr&s;a flouri&s;hed for many ages, under a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes of the race of Narbal; who all adhered faithfully to the great prin|ciples of his government, every change which became nece&s;&s;ary, in the change of times, being regulated by them.</P>
<P>But unhappily the &s;ame care was not ob&s;erved, perhaps was not po&s;&s;ible to be ob&s;erved, in the minuter matters of dome&s;tic policy. A long cour&s;e of pro&s;|perity made the Byr&s;ans forget, that their &s;tate owed its origin to misfortune; and wealth, accumulated by frugality,
<PB N="137" REF="157">
was thought to remove the nece&s;&s;ity of that virtue.</P>
<P>The natural wants of man are few, and ea&s;ily &s;upplied; but the artificial are infinite, and in&s;atiable. Not content with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, he looks around for the conveniences, from which to the luxuries the a&s;cent is in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the &s;umptuary laws, &s;o &s;trictly enjoined by Narbal, began to be relaxed, than the &s;pirit of commerce, con&s;equentially, and de&s;ignedly re&s;trained by them, broke through all bounds; and ran&s;acked every quarter of the earth to gratify the phanta&s;tick demands of luxury and caprice.</P>
<P>The opportunities, which this opened, of bartering from one to another, the various products of all the various na|tions, with whom they traded, afforded them &s;uch gain, that as their wealth had
<PB N="138" REF="158">
made them luxurious, &s;o their luxury made them wealthy.</P>
<P>The effects of this were &s;oon felt. The wealth of individuals exceeded that of the &s;tate, in every degree of ju&s;t pro|portion: and their expence exceeded that wealth. A fal&s;e refinement uni|ver&s;ally took place of that &s;ublime &s;im|plicity of &s;entiment and manners, which had been the honourable characteri&s;tic of the Byr&s;an nation. Their buildings were rai&s;ed more for o&s;tentation than u&s;e. Their garments were fa&s;hioned by vanity. Their food was cho&s;en meerly for its expence, however di&s;agreeable to the ta&s;te, or de&s;tructive to health. Re&s;pect was mea&s;ured by riches. Ho|nours were openly &s;old; or conferred for &s;ervices, in their nature mo&s;t di&s;|honourable. Virtue and merit were de|pre&s;&s;ed by contempt and neglect; while vice found favour, and injudicious mercy encouraged crimes, by di&s;arming ju&s;tice of its terrors.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="159">In a word, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life was di&s;&s;ipation; and every thing &s;erious, every regard to decency, moral virtue, and religion, was turned into ridicule.</P>
<P>In order to carry on their commerce to greater advantage, the Byr&s;ans planted colonies, in different parts of the earth, which drained their own country of its mo&s;t u&s;eful inhabitants; none who were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable wealth, or who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions did not immediately mini&s;ter to the gratification of luxury, finding any encouragement, or even being able to live at home, where the fa&s;cination of example had made a pro|fu&s;ion in expence unavoidable; and idle|ne&s;s and vanity had &s;o far enhanced the price of the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;aries of life, as to involve the indu&s;trious poor, who&s;e labour is the natural &s;upport, as their numbers make the real &s;trength of a &s;tate, in all the mi&s;eries of want; and oblige them to &s;eek &s;ub&s;i&s;tence el&s;e|where.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="160">Time &s;hewed the con&s;equence of this conduct. The&s;e colonies, encrea&s;ing in numbers, in proportion to the depopu|lation of their mother country, by &s;uch emigrations; and flouri&s;hing in all the arts carried from thence, at length felt their own &s;trength; and &s;corning a de|pendance no longer &s;upported by &s;uffi|cient power, took the fir&s;t plau&s;ible occa&s;ion to &s;hake it off; and ever after carried them&s;elves like &s;tates allied upon equal terms, rather than &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Nor was the exterior polity of the Byr&s;ans, ruled by principles of greater wi&s;dom, or virtue. Proud of their wealth, they looked with contempt on every poorer nation; and blindly mi&s;tak|ing that wealth for &s;trength, &s;crupled not to invade their rights, as views of intere&s;t or ambition chanced to tempt them.</P>
<P>Such a conduct often nece&s;&s;arily en|gaged them in wars, with the neigh|bouring
<PB N="141" REF="161">
nations; and gave the &s;anction of ju&s;tice to the attacks, which envy of their pro&s;perity had before de&s;igned again&s;t them; but as the&s;e attacks were always made on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion, and &s;ingly by the people then aggrieved, they con&s;tantly failed of their effect, and only encrea&s;ed by &s;uch exertion, the power they were intended to over-turn.</P>
<P>In this manner did they proceed for many ages, flouri&s;hing in a fal&s;e pro&s;|perity, the cau&s;e of which in&s;en&s;ibly undermined its foundation, like a tree, growing by the &s;ide of a river, who&s;e waters, at the &s;ame time, that they make its branches &s;pread, and cover them with bloom, wa&s;h away the earth from its roots; till it falls unexpectedly in the mid&s;t of its glory, over-turned by the &s;lighte&s;t gu&s;t of wind; and buries every thing near it, in its ruins.</P></Q>

If you alledge a particular reve|lation of your religion, do not others re&s;t upon a like foundation? And doth not every man believe his own to be true?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="164"><Q>In &s;uch a contrariety, by what virtue have you alone merited the preference of being right? Or rather, how hath the place of your birth merited that preference? For by that was deter|mined the mode of your religion: And would a matter of &s;uch importance have been left depending on a circum&s;tance &s;o meerly accidental?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be&s;ide, to allow what you contend for, that your religion is the only one, which is right, hath the Deity delegated to you a power, which he hath not ex|erted him&s;elf, of compelling all men to think alike? Or, if he intends &s;uch compul&s;ion, doth he want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance to effect it? Can not he, who createth the mind, mould it as he plea&s;eth? And is it not in vain; is it not impious for man to attempt controuling that which the Deity hath left free?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor is it le&s;s &s;o, to attempt u&s;urping his vengeance: If he would puni&s;h,
<PB N="145" REF="165">
are not famine and pe&s;tilence, as &s;words, in his hand? Does not the thunder roar? Do not the foundations of the earth tremble at his word? Univer&s;al bene|volence is the &s;acrifice mo&s;t acceptable to heaven; nor can any religion be derived from thence, which would en|join a breach of that invariable, eternal duty.</Q></P>
<P>Then ob&s;erving that I was ready to bur&s;t with indignation, and eagerne&s;s to controvert what he &s;aid; <Q>Repre&s;s your zeal, my &s;on,</Q> he continued, &s;oftening his voice, and regarding me, with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s; <Q>and examine di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, before you pre&s;ume to judge.

<P><Q>If only one manner of wor&s;hip could be acceptable to the Deity, would he not have made that manner known to all mankind, at their creation? Would he not have made the mind conceive it as invariably, as he made the &s;en&s;es repre|&s;ent their objects? Would he not have made it as &s;elf-evident, as the founda|tion of moral virtue, which is received without variation, by all mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Probably,</HI> DO, AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY.</NOTE>.&mdash; If eternal unhappine&s;s was to be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of differing from this manner, would it have been con|&s;i&s;tent, either with his goodne&s;s, or his ju&s;tice, to have left by &s;o much the greater part of mankind ignorant of it? This would have been to create them on purpo&s;e for unhappine&s;s. An im|putation,

which is the greate&s;t offence po&s;&s;ible for man to offer to God, &s;o far as re&s;pects him&s;elf only.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Con&s;ider, that the mode of wor&s;hip, which prevails mo&s;t in the world, is not known to the hundredth, perhaps not to the thou&s;andth part of its inhabi|tants. &mdash; Con&s;ider al&s;o how many ages have pa&s;&s;ed away, before any of the pre&s;ent modes were known at all; and then you will &s;ee the impious ab&s;urdity of excluding from mercy, all but the few profe&s;&s;ors of a particular one among them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who then &s;hall dare to call the man, who profe&s;&s;es a different mode of wor|&s;hip, an enemy to heaven? And how can it be a duty to attempt propagating by force, an uniformity, which is not pre&s;cribed? Should he not rather con|clude from its not having been pre|&s;cribed, that the variety is plea&s;ing; in the &s;ame manner as the beauty of &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="148" REF="168">
objects ari&s;eth from variation in their parts. Wherever I hear the prai&s;es of the Deity &s;ung, my &s;oul &s;hall accom|pany them, without objecting to the manner; nor will I hazard the profana|tion of &s;o &s;acred a duty, by arrogantly attempting to obtrude any other.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To prove the nece&s;&s;ary obligation of mutual benevolence, man was created in a &s;tate of indi&s;pen&s;ible dependance upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, from the fir&s;t moment of his life. Shall he not, then, give that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he has received; and mu&s;t continue to re|ceive? Have all, who have admini&s;tered relief to his wants, profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame religion with him? And would their profe&s;&s;ing another make their a&s;&s;i&s;tance ineffectual to his relief? Be the religion of a man what it will, while the mor&s;el of bread, which I receive from his hand, yields me whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment, never will I think my&s;elf ab&s;olved from, much le&s;s interdicted the duty of ad|mini&s;tering
<PB N="149" REF="169">
relief to his wants. No|thing le&s;s than an immediate interpo|&s;ition of the Deity, by a total change of natural effects, being &s;ufficient to abrogate a law, made nece&s;&s;ary by him, to my nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a word, my &s;on, the wor&s;hip, truly acceptable to the Deity, is the im|mediate act of the &s;oul, and con&s;i&s;ts in gratitude for his ble&s;&s;ings, and re&s;igna|tion to his will; while I pay that with &s;incerity of heart, I fear not his taking offence at the po&s;ture of my body, or any other&mdash;</Q></P></Q>

<P><Q>THE Byr&s;ans,</Q> re&s;umed the captive, <Q>who at the time of the arrival of tho&s;e &s;trangers were beginning to deviate from the &s;age in&s;titutions of Narbal, and turn all their attention from agriculture to commerce, gave no ob&s;truction to this new &s;ettlement; either not thinking tho&s;e mountains worth cultivating, or per|haps not being yet &s;o intoxicated by good fortune, as to forget the origin of their own &s;tate.</Q></P>
<Q><P>For &s;everal ages there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but little intercour&s;e between the Byr&s;ans and their new neighbours, who had a&s;&s;umed the name of Coptes; the Byr&s;ans, in the pride of pro&s;perity, di&s;daining to take notice of a people &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;s; and the Coptes, in the &s;ullen diffidence of that di&s;tre&s;s, keeping at
<PB N="151" REF="171">
an equal di&s;tance from &s;uch unfeeling neighbours.</P>
<P>While the Byr&s;ans therefore were ex|tending their commerce to the extremi|ties of the earth, and revelling in the luxuries which it produced, the Coptes, precluded by their &s;ituation from every foreign intercour&s;e, applied them&s;elves entirely to agriculture, in which the natural di&s;advantages of their country obliged them to exert all their indu&s;try, in order to procure the indi&s;pen&s;ible ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>But the&s;e di&s;advantages were more than made amends for by the con&s;e|quences. They &s;ecured them from the pernicious effects of luxury, and all the train of vices and evils which attend on wealth. If they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but little, they wanted &s;till le&s;s! They were &s;trong in body, and re&s;olute of &s;pirit; and their habitations were filled with a numerous and healthful progeny.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="172">In the cour&s;e of time, &s;uch unremitted indu&s;try changed the face of the coun|try, and remedied all the unkindne&s;&s;es of nature. The hills were covered with flocks and herds. The &s;ong of the hu&s;|bandman echoed in the vallies; and the voice of plenty and content was heard through all the land.</P>
<P>Such a change at length rai&s;ed the envy and avarice of the Byr&s;ans, who were then in the zenith of their glory. They &s;ent haughtily to the Coptes, to demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country, which they alledged to belong to them&s;elves; and without even waiting for an an&s;wer, prepared to march a powerful army to &s;eize by force, that which they were con&s;cious they had no right to receive peaceably.</P>
<P>The Coptes naturally were &s;urprized at &s;uch a demand; and directly &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in their &s;tate, to &s;hew the inju&s;tice of it.
<Q><PB N="153" REF="173">They alledged the length of the time, during which they had been in undi|&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, which their ance&s;tors had found de&s;olate, and unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any inhabitants. That the Byr&s;ans, far from claiming any right to it at that time, as they cer|tainly would have done, had they thought it belonged to them, took not the lea&s;t notice, much le&s;s offence at their &s;ettling there; nor had ever men|tioned &s;uch a claim in any of the tran&s;|actions which had occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ed between the two nations &s;ince. And finally, that the title of the Coptes to the country which they inhabited, was equally good with that of the Byr&s;ans to theirs; both people having been compelled by nece&s;&s;ity to fly from their native homes, and fix them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner, wherever they could find a place of refuge.</Q></P>
<P>Unan&s;werable as the&s;e arguments were, they had no force with the Byr&s;ans,

who &s;carcely deigned to wait till the king &s;hould give the amba&s;&s;adors an audience.</P>
<P>At this unhappy period commences the &s;ad &s;tory of my misfortunes, which were &s;o immediately derived from tho&s;e of my country, that I thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to give this &s;hort detail, as an intro|duction to the events of my own life.</P></Q>
<P>The entrance of an eunuch to acquaint Temugin with the arrival of an expre&s;s from the general of one of his armies, interrupted the captive at this place. He was commanded to withdraw, and wait the emperor's plea&s;ure to hear the con|tinuation of his narrative at &s;ome other time.</P>

<Q><P>The hou&s;e of my father derived its origin from Narbal, by his younge&s;t &s;on, Mago; who&s;e de&s;cendants always ju&s;ti|fied by their merits, the claim which their blood gave them to the fir&s;t offices in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>My father, who beheld with grief every deviation, from the wi&s;e in&s;titu|tions of his royal progenitor, took par|ticular care to in&s;truct me in the true &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of them, from a fond hope that heaven would one day offer &s;ome favourable opportunity for re&s;toring the government, to the purity and vigour

of its fir&s;t principles; as he well fore&s;aw, from its pre&s;ent relaxation, that &s;ome great change mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be near. But happy for him, he lived not to &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of his pre&s;age.</P>
<P>To prove the excellency of the&s;e in|&s;titutions, by compari&s;on with tho&s;e of other nations; and to avoid the dan|gerous influence of &s;uch an example, as the manners of the Byr&s;an youth then exhibited, upon an unexperienced mind, my father re&s;olved that I &s;hould travel into foreign lands, as &s;oon as rea&s;on was ripened to &s;ufficient &s;trength, to form a proper judgment upon a per&s;onal know|ledge of the ways of man.</P>
<P>Having prepared all things for this purpo&s;e, he led me into his garden, on the evening preceding the day appointed for my departure, and &s;eating me be&s;ide him, on the margin of a fountain, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me in the&s;e words!
<PB N="158" REF="178">
words, indelibly written on the tablet of my heart.</P>
<P><Q>I &s;ee, with delight,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>my &s;on, the impre&s;&s;ion, which the precepts of my care have made upon thy mind; and I fear not but heaven will enable thee to carry them into execution.</Q></P>
<Q><P>To facilitate this great end, I &s;end thee to &s;earch for wi&s;dom in the world! To read the heart of man, in his actions; and from them learn to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the appearance, and reality of things.</P>
<P>Were I to con&s;ult the tender impul&s;e of nature, I &s;hould keep thee &s;till in my bo&s;om; but I prefer thy advantage to my own plea&s;ure; (&s;hould I not rather &s;ay that thy advantage is my greate&s;t plea&s;ure!) and I part with thee for a time, in a&s;&s;ured hope of thy return|ing enriched with wi&s;dom and virtue to &s;upport the feeble &s;teps of my old age
<PB N="159" REF="179">
down the hill of life; and crown my urn with the &s;acred honour of having begotten a &s;on, worthy to &s;erve his country.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay, that my hope of thy happy return is a&s;&s;ured, I would not be under&s;tood to mean, that there are no dangers in thy way. The floating &s;ands of the de&s;art, the rage of the tempe&s;t, or the hidden rocks in the &s;ea, are le&s;s dangerous than the allure|ments, vice lays in the way of the tra|veller: Allurements, which it requires the immediate guidance of heaven to avoid, they offer them&s;elves in &s;uch various &s;hapes, and &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly &s;imu|late the very virtues, which they coun|teract.</P>
<P>I will not burthen thy mind with a repetition of the advice, which it has been the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of my life, to in&s;till into it. The few following hints, as they relate immediately to the &s;cene,
<PB N="160" REF="180">
on which you are ju&s;t entering, are all I &s;hall &s;ay at pre&s;ent; and then com|mit thy &s;teps to that guidance, which is never withheld from virtue, if &s;ought with humble, and ardent &s;upplication.</P>
<P>Open thine eyes, and thine ears; but bar the door of thy lips. A&s;k no que&s;tions! Enter not into arguments. Concern not your&s;elf in the affairs of others; nor reveal your own, where the importance of the occa&s;ion doth not make &s;uch a confidence indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Silence is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed to be the con&s;equence of wi&s;dom. It there|fore engages confidence; and commands re&s;pect.</P>
<P>If you meet any thing, which you do not directly comprehend, conclude that the difficulty ari&s;es from your own inattention; and con&s;ider the matter again, with better care. One doubt, thus &s;olved by your&s;elf, will open your
<PB N="161" REF="181">
mind more, by exerci&s;ing its powers, than the &s;olution of many, by another.</P>
<P>As for arguing, in&s;tead of elucidat|ing difficulties, it only creates ani|mo&s;ity, and confirms error; the pride of man making him more anxious to &s;upport his own opinion, than to in|ve&s;tigate truth. And this was the rea|&s;on of that my&s;terious &s;ilence enjoined to his pupils, by one of the wi&s;e&s;t of the we&s;tern &s;ages.</P></Q>

<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed thro' &s;everal regions, in all of which, under appearances, and by means utterly contradictory to each other, I &s;aw the &s;ame end of pre&s;ent gra|tification univer&s;ally pur&s;ued, with the mo&s;t anxious and in&s;atiable eagerne&s;s, I arrived at length upon the banks of the great river Euphrates, whither I was drawn by an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire to receive in&s;truction from the mouth of the &s;age Myrza, the fame of who&s;e wi&s;dom and &s;anctity had gone forth into all the na|tions of the Ea&s;t.</P>

<P>Though report proclaimed him to have mea&s;ured more than twice the u&s;ual life of man, and knowledge was writ|ten in characters of deepe&s;t reflection in his face, his eye had not lo&s;t the pene|trating fire, nor his limbs the &s;trength of youth. He was crowned with all the

<P>Having kindly enquired the motive of my coming, he led me to his habi|tation, at the entrance of which he re|&s;umed his &s;eat, placing me be&s;ide him, while my &s;laves pitched their tents among &s;ome lofty trees at a little di&s;|tance on the bank of the river; then ob&s;erving that I had not yet overcome the awe with which his pre&s;ence had &s;truck me, <Q>Knowledge, my &s;on,</Q> &s;aid he, with a &s;mile of the mo&s;t encourag|ing complacency, <Q>is a gift be&s;towed with a &s;paring hand, and to but very few; the utmo&s;t abilities of man reach|ing little farther than to di&s;cover his own ignorance.

<P><Q>So happily would the circle of man's day wind up, were his de&s;ires limited within the &s;ame bounds. I &s;peak of the de&s;ires of rea&s;on as well as &s;en&s;e; for rea&s;on and nature never differ. A wi&s;h for &s;omething more would not prevent his enjoyment; nor di&s;appointment break his re&s;t.

<P><Q>Surely,</Q> I returned, <Q>O my father, the way to knowledge cannot be with|out end to him, who &s;ets out early, and is &s;o happy as to have an in&s;tructor ca|pable of directing his &s;teps?</Q></P>

When he was a&s;ked the cau&s;e of the&s;e properties, and why &s;uch forms and arrangements produced tho&s;e effects, he was unable to give an an&s;wer &s;atisfactory even to him&s;elf, much le&s;s to the enquirer.</P>
<P>The pride of wealth being hurt by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this ignorance, he de|termined to &s;ave his &s;ons from &s;uch di&s;|grace, by giving them a liberal educa|tion before he &s;hould begin to teach them his art.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, he procured them the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters, in all the &s;everal branches of philo&s;ophy, who executed their charge with the greate&s;t fidelity, though not with equal &s;ucce&s;s to their pupils, the turn and powers of
<PB N="171" REF="191">
who&s;e minds were totally different from each other.</P>
<P>Kerker, the elder, was lively in the extreme degree. His imagination out|ran the precepts of his in&s;tructor. With|out waiting to examine farther than the fir&s;t glance, he catched at the conclu|&s;ion, before they could adduce half the proofs; and his tongue never wanted the happie&s;t words to expre&s;s his con|ceptions.</P>
<P>Ha&s;&s;an, on the contrary, was given to doubt. He paid no re&s;pect to autho|rity, nor would admit any thing with|out the cleare&s;t proof, in examining which, he was &s;o cautious and &s;low, that he wore out the patience of in&s;truc|tors, who he&s;itated not to pronounce him incapable of learning, and there|fore coun&s;elled his father to apply him wholly to his trade.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="192">While Kerker, con&s;equently, was in|dulging him&s;elf in ranging through the boundle&s;s regions of theory, and rea&s;on|ing upon cau&s;es and effects according to the various &s;y&s;tems of the philo&s;ophy he had &s;tudied, Ha&s;&s;an was obliged to con|fine his thoughts to his labour; and to re&s;t &s;atisfied with that &s;mall pittance of knowledge, which he could elicit from experience.</P>
<P>Though Mu&s;tapha felt this di&s;ap|pointment of his hopes in his younger &s;on with the fondne&s;s of a father, he found con&s;olation in the rapid progre&s;s made by the elder; and his heart ex|ulted when he heard him di&s;play his learning to the crowds whom his fame collected round him.</P>
<P>But this exultation la&s;ted not long. The knowledge of Kerker was merely &s;peculative; and by mi&s;application de|feated the end it was de&s;igned to obtain. Confiding in it, he had di&s;dained to
<PB N="173" REF="193">
apply him&s;elf to the gradual practice of an art, with the principles of which he was &s;o well acquainted; and think|ing he could execute whatever he thought he under&s;tood, he affected to mount at once to that eminence of &s;kill, which can be attained only by long and careful application.</P>
<P>He could explain the nature of pre|cious &s;tones, and account for the dif|ferent degrees of their perfection; but when they were placed before him, he was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e degrees; and often bought the wor&s;t in&s;tead of the be&s;t. He could de&s;cribe the effects produced by the various combinations of their colours, but he knew not how to combine them &s;o as to produce the effects he de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence naturally was, that his knowledge was turned into ridicule. He lo&s;t his bu&s;ine&s;s, and wa&s;ted the wealth earned by his father, in &s;o much
<PB N="174" REF="194">
that he would have wanted a mor&s;el of bread in his old age, had he not found a re&s;ource in his younger &s;on; who thinking for him&s;elf, while the elder read the opinions of others, and labour|ing while he talked, had drawn real knowledge from its true &s;ource, expe|rience; and arrived regularly at the end, which his brother had mi&s;&s;ed, by mi&s;taking the effect for the cau&s;e, and beginning where he &s;hould have ended.</P></Q>
<P>Surely, my father, &s;aid I, ob&s;erving that Myrza pau&s;ed at the&s;e words to leave the application to my&s;elf, the moral of this tale cannot have reference to my ca&s;e! To think of arriving at excellence in manual arts by &s;peculative in&s;truction, without a regular gradation of practice, were mo&s;t ab&s;urd. But may I not dare to doubt if &s;cience is within the &s;ame rule! Is there not, for in|&s;tance, an e&s;&s;ential difference between polity and mechani&s;m? Between know|ledge
<PB N="175" REF="195">
of the intere&s;ts of nations, and of the value of precious &s;tones?</P>
<P><Q>The difference between &s;cience and art,</Q> replied the &s;age, <Q>&s;o far as they have reference to the u&s;es of life (and to con&s;ider them farther were foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e) is confined to their objects, and extends not to their manner of operation.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Even in &s;cience meerly &s;peculative, which terminates in it&s;elf, the mind proceeds by as regular a gradation, as the hand in works of art: but becau&s;e the &s;teps of this gradation are not &s;o immediately &s;een, the vanity of man overlooks it, and attempts to ri&s;e to the &s;ummit at a &s;ingle bound; and hence proceed mo&s;t of the errors which defeat his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>In&s;truction teaches the mind the u&s;e of its own powers; and points out the directe&s;t path to knowledge; but there
<PB N="176" REF="196">
its purpo&s;e ends. To acquire that knowledge, the mind mu&s;t prove the truth of precept by practice. A &s;pe|culative jeweller is not liable to commit greater errors in his profe&s;&s;ion, than is a &s;peculative king.</P>
<P>Can it be thought le&s;s difficult to di&s;cover the different characters, and apply their abilities properly, which is the perfection of the art of governing, or polity; than to know the value of jewels, and combine their colours? Why is not government arrived at greater perfection; and the intere&s;ts of nations more improved? Is it that they will not admit of more improve|ment; and that the nature of man can|not be better governed? By no means. The fault is in the agent, not the &s;ub|ject. The errors of a prince, lifted from the cradle or &s;eraglio to the throne, of a vi&s;ier cho&s;en meerly from favour, undo in one hour the work of an age, and require the wi&s;dom of an|other
<PB N="177" REF="197">
to bring things back to their fir&s;t &s;tate: and this it is which hath pre|vented polity from arriving at greater perfection.</P></Q></Q>

<P><Q>The wi&s;dom of thy father,</Q> returned the &s;age, <Q>hath &s;ent thee forth into the world, with a mind well prepared by in&s;truction to draw from experience that practical knowledge, which is nece&s;&s;ary to conduct thee &s;afely through life, and enable thee to fulfil the duties of it; but his fondne&s;s hath thrown ob&s;tacles in thy way, which if not timely re|moved, may di&s;appoint his hopes.</Q></P>

<P>Before the wealthy, all men wear a ma&s;k. His equals in wealth di&s;gui&s;e their &s;entiments under an appearance of politene&s;s; and &s;hew only the bright &s;ide of their country, from emulative pride.

<P>To &s;ee the world properly, you mu&s;t enter into it. You mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s your long train of attendants, lay a&s;ide your purple robes, and mix with the multi|tude without any mark of di&s;tinction to
<PB N="179" REF="199">
put them on their guard. Thus only can you learn their real &s;entiments, and trace the motives of their actions.</P></Q>
<P>'But is there no danger in doing this?' I returned, hurt at an injunction &s;o hu|miliating to the pride of condition, &s;o contrary to the cour&s;e of life in which I had been brought up. 'Is not a traveller &s;ubject to many accidents and di&s;a&s;ters, which require care and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance? Are there not menial offices, which a man cannot &s;o well perform for him&s;elf?'&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>And who performs them for thy &s;lave?</Q> replied the &s;age. <Q>Who &s;preads a carpet for the pilgrim in the wilderne&s;s? or guards the mariner from the dangers of the &s;ea?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But this is the vanity of man! Is thy nature &s;uperior to theirs? And is not the di&s;tinction between you merely accidental? Man wants not a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="180" REF="200">
to perform, for him&s;elf, the very few offices which are really nece&s;&s;ary for him! Nor is one &s;tate of life expo&s;ed to greater dangers than another. Be &s;uperior to this vain weakne&s;s. The power which protects and provides for every living thing, will not neglect you, while you de&s;erve his care.</Q></P>
<P>The force of truth is irre&s;i&s;tible. I was humbled in my own eyes; and hung down my head aba&s;hed before him. After a pau&s;e of a few moments, I threw my&s;elf at his feet, and em|bracing his knees, 'I &s;ee, I acknow|ledge my error, &s;aid I, and will cor|rect it. I will go directly to Bagdat, and there &s;ell all tho&s;e &s;laves, of who&s;e attendance thou ha&s;t &s;hewn me the evil; happy if by this obedience I may ap|pear not unworthy of thy farther in|&s;truction; to implore which, I will return to you.'</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="201"><Q>And why &s;hould'&s;t thou &s;ell them?</Q> he returned, rai&s;ing me tenderly from the ground. <Q>Why not re&s;tore them to that liberty which is the common right of all mankind; tho' &s;o many are unju&s;tly deprived of it, that grown familiar, and in a manner &s;anctified by u&s;e, the inju&s;tice hath almo&s;t lo&s;t its native appearance, and pa&s;&s;es for a right.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>'Are then all men equal?' &s;aid I, amazed at what I heard. 'And have all a right to the &s;ame &s;tations in life?'</P>
<P><Q>That all are equal in their nature,</Q> he replied, <Q>Rea&s;on will infallibly &s;hew you; as it will al&s;o &s;hew, that they have an equal right to the &s;ame &s;tations, if they can arrive at them, by ju&s;t means.

<P>His words in&s;tantly di&s;pelled the clouds of prejudice, in which my mind was involved, opening my heart, with delight, to &s;entiments, which vindicated human nature from &s;uch indignity. I &s;et all my &s;laves at liberty; and was proceeding to divide among them the wealth, which my father had given me, to defray the expences of my journey: but Myrza re&s;trained me.</P>
<P><Q>Hold,</Q> &s;aid he. <Q>Prudence is a virtue, equally with genero&s;ity; and a man may be unju&s;t to him&s;elf, no le&s;s than to another. Give them the means of &s;upporting life, by hone&s;t indu&s;try, or the gift of liberty will be of little value to them. But make not your|&s;elf poor, to make them unnece&s;&s;arily rich.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="183" REF="203"><P>I perceive that the greate&s;t part of the wealth, given to you by your father, con&s;i&s;ts in precious &s;tones. Re&s;erve the&s;e for your&s;elf.

If not; they will be too much.</P>
<P>Nor would I coun&s;el you to di&s;mi&s;s all your attendants indi&s;criminately; and launch into the world ab&s;olutely alone: You are yet too inexperienced in its ways, for &s;uch an adventurous enter|prize. Is there not among them &s;ome one, whom your father hath particu|larly

<P>The&s;e cares con&s;uming the re&s;t of the day, I remained that night the gue&s;t of Myr&s;a, who, after we had clo&s;ed the evening, in the &s;ame manner as the pre|ceding, lodged me in one of the rece&s;&s;es of his grottoe.</P>

<Q><P>I WOULD have departed the next morning; but Myrza in&s;i&s;ted on my tarrying with him for a few days, every hour of which added to my knowledge, as he always turned his conver&s;ation to the &s;ubjects mo&s;t in&s;tructive; and en|couraged me to declare every doubt, which oppo&s;ed my a&s;&s;enting to his words.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom, which he &s;hewed in &s;olving the&s;e doubts; and his &s;agacity in frequently anticipating my declaration of them, as if he &s;aw into my very &s;oul, confirmed me &s;o &s;trongly in the opinion propagated by fame, of his holding conver&s;e with the &s;piritual be|ings,
<PB N="186" REF="206">
who watch over the actions of man, that I could not forbear taking occa&s;ion, one evening, as we &s;at on the bank of the river di&s;cour&s;ing on various &s;ubjects, to a&s;k him how it might be po&s;&s;ible to obtain the happine&s;s of an intercour&s;e with them.</P>
<P><Q>That there are &s;piritual beings, my &s;on,</Q> &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, as if to con&s;ider &s;o difficult a &s;ubject, <Q>which inhabit the &s;everal ele|ments of which this world is compo&s;ed, as well as the earth is inhabited by man, is an opinion, founded on &s;uch te&s;timony of the fact, and which hath &s;o univer|&s;ally prevailed in every age, and coun|try, that it were offering an affront to the human mind to &s;uppo&s;e it utterly without foundation.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Nor doth its credit depend &s;olely on this invariable con&s;ent. Rea&s;on receives it with reverence, as one of tho&s;e &s;ublime probabilities, which though above its
<PB N="187" REF="207">
power to prove, yet contradict none of tho&s;e te&s;ts, on which it re&s;ts the proof of matters, incapable of direct demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>The infinite variety of animated be|ings, which we behold cover the face of the earth, &s;o as not to leave one atom of it uninhabited, gives cau&s;e to conclude that the other elements are peopled al&s;o as fully, by beings to who&s;e organs of life they are adapted, though impercep|tible to the gro&s;&s;er &s;en&s;es of man; as el&s;e there would be a void, an u&s;ele&s;s part in the works of the Deity; a &s;up|po&s;ition contradicting the &s;acred, and &s;elf-evident truth, that he doth nothing in vain.</P>
<P>But though rea&s;on can thus re&s;t it&s;elf &s;atisfied in the exi&s;tence of &s;uch beings, its re&s;earches into their nature and oc|cupation meet not with equal &s;ucce&s;s: Whether they are immortal, and were all created at the &s;ame time? Or if not,
<PB N="188" REF="208">
in what manner the &s;pecies is continued; and whether they are immaterial, or only compo&s;ed of matter more &s;ubtile than the objects of human &s;en&s;e; being que&s;tions, in the pathle&s;s, illimitable contemplation of which, the mind wan|ders at a lo&s;s, for any certain point, whereon to re&s;t belief.</P>
<P>As to their occupation, the &s;ame uni|ver&s;al opinion, which agrees in their exi&s;tence, agrees al&s;o in a&s;&s;igning to them the conduct of man's actions, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be good or bad, according to the nature of the &s;pirit, which directs them. But this opinion, be&s;ide that it is un&s;upported by other proof like the former, is attended with great difficulties, and mu&s;t for many rea&s;ons be received with great, and mo&s;t cautious limitations.</P>
<P>If the actions of man are entirely directed by &s;uch beings, what becomes of his free-agency, on which alone can
<PB N="189" REF="209">
depend the merit, or demerit of tho&s;e actions? And are not tho&s;e beings ju&s;tly chargeable with them, not he?</P>
<P>But this difficulty, and many others attending this opinion, which are &s;o evident that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat them, will vani&s;h, if in&s;tead of a&s;&s;ign|ing to tho&s;e beings the direction of man's actions, we &s;uppo&s;e them em|ployed in his protection from the many dangers incident to his nature, and in which his pa&s;&s;ions every moment en|tangle him.

<Q><P><Q>IN re&s;pect to what you mentioned of an intercour&s;e between man and the&s;e beings, that al&s;o is a que&s;tion, attended with many difficulties, and to be mo&s;t cautiou&s;ly received.</Q></P>
<P>How! I exclaimed, a&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;appointed at what I heard. Is not the te&s;timony of &s;o many wi&s;e, and holy men, who a&s;&s;ert their having both &s;een, and heard them, a &s;ufficient proof of this intercour&s;e?&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I deny not the reality of the inter|cour&s;e,</Q> replied the &s;age. <Q>I only am in doubt concerning the manner of it; whether perceptibly to the &s;en&s;es, or only in the power of imagination.</Q></P>
<Q><P>If they are immaterial, how can they have a form to be &s;een? How can they emit a voice to be heard? If they are
<PB N="191" REF="211">
material, how can they appear in&s;tantly clo&s;e to a man, without any appear|ance of gradual approach? How can they melt into air, and di&s;appear totally, in an in&s;tant, without gradual departure? And is it not more con&s;onant to rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that being <HI>mind</HI> them&s;elves, they hold intercour&s;e only with the mind, and are reflected upon the &s;en&s;es, by the power of imagination, in the &s;ame manner as objects in a dream. A &s;uppo&s;ition, on which that te&s;timony may po&s;&s;ibly be found to depend chiefly for credit; &s;o many ab&s;urdities and contradictions being &s;upported by it, equally with the mo&s;t important truths; that without this method of accounting for the deception of the te&s;tifier, the mind would reject the latter, becau&s;e of the former.</P>
<P>Not that this &s;uppo&s;ition is unat|tended with difficulties either. Such a manner of conver&s;ing is certainly above our comprehen&s;ion; but then it con|tradicts
<PB N="192" REF="212">
not rea&s;on; and if we refu&s;e a&s;&s;ent to every thing, which we cannot clearly comprehend, our knowledge will be reduced within very narrow limits. I know that my hand moves in obedience to my will; but I know not how my will operates upon my hand to effect that motion. We de|ceive our&s;elves with vain words. Our boa&s;ted knowledge extends only to facts; but the manner, in which the&s;e are ef|fected, is hidden from us.</P></Q>
<P>'But doth not the admi&s;&s;ion of this po&s;&s;ibility of deception,' I returned, 'at the &s;ame time weaken, if not over-turn all hi&s;toric faith, which depends entirely upon te&s;timony?'</P>
<P><Q>Not in the lea&s;t,</Q> replied the &s;age. <Q>Te&s;timony is certainly &s;ufficient proof of facts, which run in the regular cour&s;e of nature. But where this is deviated from, too much caution can not be taken in examining the end of that

deviation; and the competency of the te&s;timony, by which it is &s;upported.</Q></P>
<Q><P>When you tell me, that the city of Byr&s;a was founded by Narbal, on the de&s;truction of Carthage by the Romans, I he&s;itate not a moment to give credit to your words; becau&s;e people who lived at the time, and therefore may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ac|quainted with the fact, have left written memorials, which have been handed down regularly from them to us, that there was &s;uch a city as Carthage; and that it was de&s;troyed by a people called Romans&mdash;becau&s;e there is nothing out of the common cour&s;e of things, in &s;uch a de&s;truction; or in a prince's flying from the conquerors, with a number of the citizens, and founding a &s;tate, in another country; and be|cau&s;e you have &s;ufficient ability, and may have had &s;ufficient opportunity to trace the &s;tate, in which you were born,
<PB N="194" REF="214">
to its origin; and can have no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to attempt impo&s;ing a fal&s;ehood upon my credulity.</P>
<P>But &s;hould you tell me, that the flight of Narbal was in con&s;equence of a &s;pirit's having appeared to him; and commanded him to leave his own coun|try, and go to that where he founded his &s;tate, I might receive the relation with re&s;pect, becau&s;e of the virtue of the relator, and the importance of the end propo&s;ed by &s;uch appearance; but not without a doubt, when I balance again&s;t his te&s;timony the po&s;&s;ibility of its being only in the power of imagina|tion, and the irregularity of the fact, in the common cour&s;e of nature; and al&s;o, becau&s;e it may have been feigned by him to promote an expedition, on which he was intent, and doubted the &s;ufficiency of his own influence to carry into execution, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch an authority.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="215">But &s;hould you add, that on his arrival at that place, the &s;tones and trees in&s;tantly formed them&s;elves into a city for the reception of his people, to &s;ave them the delay and labour of building, I &s;hould directly reject the whole, as a fiction devi&s;ed &s;ince his time, for the purpo&s;e of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Nor is there any danger of this prin|ciple's breaking the vigour of the mind, by inducing a general doubt, if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not applied beyond its proper limits.</P>
<P>Credulity, and &s;ceptici&s;m are the ex|tremities of a line, in the middle of which true knowledge is placed.</P>
<P>By believing indi&s;criminately, the mind lies open to receive the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t dangerous errors; by indi&s;cri|minate doubt, to reject the mo&s;t im|portant truths. To find the mean, be|tween the&s;e, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of rea&s;on, which it &s;eldom fails in, when per|mitted
<PB N="196" REF="216">
to &s;eek for it, without pre|judice.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that if we deny every thing, which we do not clearly com|prehend, our knowledge will be reduced within very narrow bounds! Perhaps the&s;e bounds are already narrower, than we are well aware.</P>
<P>I know that I exi&s;t, becau&s;e I per|ceive the operations of my mind. I know that I derive not my exi&s;tence from my&s;elf, becau&s;e I know not how I came to exi&s;t. I therefore know that another being, from whom I derive my exi&s;tence, mu&s;t al&s;o exi&s;t; and I know that this being mu&s;t exi&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily, without deriving exi&s;tence from any other, becau&s;e an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is impo&s;&s;ible: And la&s;tly, I know, that as all other beings derive their exi&s;tence from this being, &s;o they can exi&s;t only by him; and therefore that it is their duty to obey tho&s;e laws, which he hath

thought proper to pre&s;cribe to them: but farther than this, I know nothing.</P>
<P>And with this portion of knowledge, I am humbly and gratefully content; not will I mi&s;apply the gift, by attempt|ing to pry farther, &s;atisfied that, little as it may appear, it is amply &s;ufficient to conduct me in &s;afety, through the dangers of this life, to the happine&s;s of the next.</P></Q>
<P>Though the plea&s;ure, I found in the conver&s;ation of Myrza, encrea&s;ed every hour, with the increa&s;e of knowledge, which I derived from it, I forgot not my&s;elf &s;o far, as to engro&s;s too much of that time, which &s;hould be a com|mon benefit to all mankind. At the end of fifteen days, I departed from him, and committing my&s;elf with hum|ble re&s;ignation to the guidance of heaven, re&s;umed my travels, in company with the friend whom he had &s;elected for me.</P></Q>

<Q><P>THE &s;un had but ju&s;t began to gild the firmament, with the fir&s;t beams of day, when I left the grottoe of Myrza. The &s;ound of his voice was &s;till in my ears. I exulted in the proficiency I had made under his in&s;tructions; and thought my&s;elf &s;uperior to every incident of life.</P>
<P>But I had not proceeded far, before this confidence began to cool. I &s;oon felt the fatigue of travelling, in a man|ner to which I was unaccu&s;tomed; and the thought of my being alone, for with a &s;ingle companion I e&s;teemed my|&s;elf little better, awoke &s;en&s;ations, in no re&s;pect plea&s;ing. I &s;tarted in affright; and blu&s;hed at my own weakne&s;s! I rea&s;oned again&s;t it; but it eluded my rea&s;ons. At length, I compounded the conte&s;t. I re&s;olved to continue my jour|ney to Bagdat; and if I &s;hould find the
<PB N="199" REF="219">
inconveniencies overbalance the ad|vantage, to provide new attendants there.</P>
<P>But my fellow traveller, and friend, &s;aved me from &s;uch a weakne&s;s. He perceived my unea&s;ine&s;s, and was alarmed for my health; by limiting his enquiries to which he per&s;uaded me that he had not di&s;covered my di&s;order to be in my mind, and rouzed the &s;pirit of pride to conceal my &s;hame.</P>
<P>This employed my thoughts, till the cau&s;e of my unea&s;ine&s;s became familiar to me, when it totally vani&s;hed; and I only wondered that I had been unea&s;y.</P>
<P>On the third day of our journey we joined a numerous caravan of merchants, who had pitched their tents on the bank of the river, to avoid the heat of the &s;un, which had now mounted high in the heavens.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="220">The habits of Faquirs, which we had a&s;&s;umed by the advice of Myrza, gained us immediate admi&s;&s;ion into their company, where I was in&s;tantly &s;truck with the openne&s;s of their behaviour, which &s;eemed to flow directly from na|ture, without de&s;ign or re&s;erve.</P>
<P>This was entirely new to me. <Q>I revere thy wi&s;dom, &s;age Myrza,</Q> &s;aid I to my&s;elf! <Q>I now &s;ee life, in its genuine colours! How happy am I at being freed from the crowd of atten|dance, who have hitherto &s;tood between me, and mankind?</Q></P>
<P>But this happine&s;s did not continue long unclouded. They were going to eat; and de&s;ired me to ta&s;te a mor&s;el of bread with them. I &s;at down accord|ingly; but &s;tarted to &s;ee a &s;lave &s;eat him&s;elf next to me; and my heart re|volted at my being obliged to fetch water from the river for my&s;elf to drink.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="221">A very little u&s;e, however, reconciled me al&s;o to this deba&s;ement, as I at fir&s;t thought it, better than all the in&s;truc|tions of Myrza had been able to do; and convinced me of the vanity of that wi&s;dom, which is acquired only by in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>On being informed that the caravan journied to Bagdat, I de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to continue with them; which was readily granted to me; and I re&s;olved to begin the practice of Myrza's pre|cepts. I accordingly ob&s;erved with the &s;tricte&s;t attention every thing I &s;aw, and heard; and the doubts of one day were generally &s;olved by the next, without my a&s;king any &s;olution of them.</P>
<P>This conduct &s;oon gained me the re&s;pect and confidence of the whole company. I was e&s;teemed wi&s;e, becau&s;e I betrayed not my ignorance, by a&s;king information: And every one was eager to communicate his &s;ecrets to me, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="222">
I never enquired into them; there being nothing which &s;o effectually coun|teracts curio&s;ity, as the di&s;covery of it.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes, which this confidence opened to me, would have amply over|payed my &s;ilence, had it been never &s;o contrary to my temper. I now &s;aw things, in colours the mo&s;t different from tho&s;e, in which they had appeared to me, at my fir&s;t joining the caravan; and found that the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions rule the human heart, in every &s;tate of life; even the coar&s;e je&s;t, the loud laugh of mer|riment, tho&s;e reputed characteri&s;tics of vulgar happine&s;s, I could too often trace to motives the mo&s;t unhappy; and &s;ee them joined in and enjoyed only in proportion to the malignancy of the allu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This general confidence though was not unattended by its inconveniences. Every one, who told me his &s;ecrets, taking my &s;ilence for approbation, ex|pected
<PB N="203" REF="223">
that I &s;hould enter into his views; and was continually obtruding upon me his &s;chemes for their accompli&s;hment, in which he thought him&s;elf entitled to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o far as to look upon my holding the common intercour&s;e of humanity with his adver&s;ary, as an act of treachery to him: A &s;ituation too embarra&s;&s;ing to have been long &s;upported.</P>
<P>One evening, as I was ruminating upon the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies, and con&s;ider|ing how I &s;hould di&s;entangle my&s;elf from the con&s;equences of them, one of the principal merchants in the caravan ac|co&s;ting me in a friendly manner;</P>
<P><Q>Ha&s;&s;an,</Q> &s;aid he, (for I had changed my own name of Himilco, for this, to avoid being traced by any of my late attendants) <Q>I have ob&s;erved your de|meanor, ever &s;ince you have come among us; and &s;ee that your wi&s;dom
<PB N="204" REF="224">
exceeds your age. I have therefore re|&s;olved to make a propo&s;al to you, which will give you the &s;tronge&s;t proof of my e&s;teem.</Q></P>
<Q><P>You have been informed that this caravan journies to Bagdat. It is not my intention to accompany it, &s;o far. I &s;hall turn off to-morrow evening to the country of Far&s;i&s;tan, whither &s;ome matters of importance call me; after I &s;hall have executed which, I propo&s;e continuing my travels, through that once flouri&s;hing country, to the regions, who&s;e happy people are fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of the &s;un, on his emerg|ing from the ocean, to enlighten the world.</P>
<P>From your habit, I judge, that the motive of your travelling is to acquire knowledge. If &s;o! this is the path, which leads directly to it. The &s;ages of antiquity never thought their thir&s;t
<PB N="205" REF="225">
for wi&s;dom &s;atisfied, till they came, and drank at this fountain head.</P>
<P>If you chu&s;e to accompany me, in this journey, we will drink out of the &s;ame cup, as brothers. My people are &s;ufficient in numbers to defend us from the dangers of the way; and the pro|fit, which I &s;hall gain by my merchan|dize, will enable me to make provi&s;ion for the wants of both our future lives. I &s;hall not attempt to influence your compliance by any arguments of per|&s;ua&s;ion. You be&s;t know the motives which ought to direct your conduct, and will be guided by them.</P></Q>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the emo|tions, which I felt at this propo&s;al. I had long had the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee the countries, whither he was going; but then the length of the way mu&s;t detain me much beyond the time pre|&s;cribed by my father for my return.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="226">The difficulty was mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. But after revolving various &s;chemes, I at length thought of one, which ap|peared to reconcile my duty to my in|clination. I re&s;olved to &s;end back my companion to my father, in order to inform him of my intended journey; and obviate his apprehen&s;ions at my pro|tracted ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The merchant approving of this de|&s;ign, I proceeded immediately to put it in execution. The parting between my friend and me was mo&s;t tender. Gra|titude for the re&s;titution of his liberty, had exalted his attachment to me, into the warme&s;t affection. He embraced my knees, he be&s;ought me, with many tears, to let him accompany me, in my long, and perilous journey; and &s;end &s;ome other in his place.</P>
<P><Q>Who will &s;erve you, in the day? Who will watch over you, in the night?</Q> &s;aid he wringing his hands in angui&s;h of
<PB N="207" REF="227">
&s;oul. <Q>You are not &s;ufficiently inured to hard&s;hip! Your years are too few; your &s;trength is unequal to the fatigues, into which you are plunging! Should &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;a&s;ter befal you, who is to admini&s;ter relief?&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>That power, I an&s;wered, in the words of Myrza, who&s;e goodne&s;s is the &s;up|port of all his works; or human care and relief would be in vain. A &s;up|port, in which the piety of my father will think me &s;afe. Not that I am in|&s;en&s;ible to your affection. I would gladly &s;end another, but you know it is not in my power. Of all, whom I might have &s;ent, you only remain with me; nor would my father give the &s;ame credit to the words of any, as he will to your's!&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;aw that it was in vain to urge me farther, and would not di&s;tre&s;s me, with fruitle&s;s &s;olicitation.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="228">My mind was &s;o full of the gratifi|cation, I promi&s;ed to my curio&s;ity, in this journey, that I never attended to the circum&s;tances in which I undertook it. Circum&s;tances in reality much more terrifying, than tho&s;e which had lately &s;truck me with &s;o many terrors. I then had an experienced, a careful, and an affectionate friend with me. I had now implicitly entru&s;ted my&s;elf to the faith of people, who were in a great mea&s;ure &s;trangers to me. But it was too late to look back.</P></Q>

<Q><P>ON our entering the empire of Far|&s;i&s;tan, I was &s;truck with horror, to be|hold the de&s;olation and havoc which deformed the face of a country, made &s;o beautiful by the hand of nature. The lands were uncultivated the cities lay in ruins! and the few wretched people, de&s;titute of every comfort, and almo&s;t of every nece&s;&s;ary of life, wandered from place to place, to &s;eek the precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the day.</P>
<P>But this univer&s;al mi&s;ery affected me not more than the advantage taken of it by the merchant, who exacted the higher prices for his commodities, the greater he &s;aw nece&s;&s;ity for them; ag|gravating public calamities, by turning them to private gain.</P>
<P>Nor was my abhorrence of &s;uch &s;or|did inhumanity greater than my &s;ur|prize,
<PB N="210" REF="230">
when I compared it with his conduct on other occa&s;ions. For tho' the habit of taking advantage in his dealing had gained &s;o &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, that he could not refrain from it on any con&s;ideration of circum|&s;tances; in every other in&s;tance he was generous and humane; and would rea|dily be&s;tow upon the &s;ame per&s;on of who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities he had taken &s;uch cruel advantage, more than he had exacted from him; as, &s;hould he come the next moment to purcha&s;e any thing el&s;e, he could not avoid repeating his exaction of the very money which he had ju&s;t before given him in charity; and would give him again, if reque&s;ted, from the &s;ame motive.</P>
<P>Our journey through the territories of Far&s;i&s;tan afforded no incident worthy of relation. The country continued to exhibit one &s;cene of de&s;olation, more painful to the view than the barren de|&s;art; the traces of former pro&s;perity
<PB N="211" REF="231">
aggravating the contemplation of pre|&s;ent mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>My fellow traveller &s;aw what I felt, and endeavoured to divert my thoughts to more plea&s;ing objects. <Q>When we &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed the great river of In|dus,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the &s;ight of that coun|try will amply compen&s;ate for the&s;e di&s;agreeable &s;cenes. Indu&s;try there flou|ri&s;hes in the &s;miles of freedom. Com|merce is encouraged in all its various branches. An univer&s;al plenty covers the land; and the people are numerous, healthy, and happy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor le&s;s &s;o were the people of this country once; till ambition overturned the works of art, and marred the ble&s;|&s;ings of nature. The magnificence of the ruins, which &s;till remain, &s;ufficiently prove its former happine&s;s. But among &s;laves, nothing can flouri&s;h.

<P><Q>THE appearance of the country, after we had pa&s;&s;ed the great rivers,</Q> re|&s;umed the captive, <Q>&s;upported not the repre&s;entations of the merchant.

<Q><P>While he was preparing to exhibit his merchandize for traffic, in the fir&s;t city at which we arrived, I walked forth, as was my cu&s;tom, to view the place, and ob&s;erve the manners of the people.

<P><PB N="214" REF="234">The admonition of my father, that moment recurred to my mind. I re|&s;olved to wait for information, from accident, without making any enquiries, for fear of involving my&s;elf in whatever misfortune had happened to him.</P>

<Q><P><Q>THE difference in the produce of the different parts of the world,</Q> continued the Bramin, <Q>hath been ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to a beneficent de&s;ign in the Creator, to rai&s;e a friendly intercour&s;e between the inhabitants, by laying them under a nece&s;&s;ity of applying to
<PB N="218" REF="238">
each other for the mutual &s;upply of their wants.</Q></P>
<Q><P>In &s;uch an intercour&s;e, this country, of all under heaven, &s;hould naturally &s;eem entitled to the preeminence, as having not only every nece&s;&s;ary, but al&s;o every convenience, and unhappily, almo&s;t every luxury of life within it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But alas! it is the u&s;e which con&s;e|crates the ble&s;&s;ing. This very plenty is made to di&s;appoint the end for which it was given. It blunts the reli&s;h of enjoyment; and deprives the body of &s;trength and the mind of vigour, by taking away the nece&s;&s;ity of care and labour. Wanting nothing, we wi&s;h not, we &s;trive not for any thing; but &s;it in indolent expectation of that which we know the revolving &s;ea&s;on will bring to us, till we become an ea&s;y prey to tho&s;e, who&s;e fortunately le&s;s favourable clime and &s;oil oblige them to &s;truggle with difficulties, and brave dangers, in
<PB N="219" REF="239">
order to procure el&s;ewhere, tho&s;e things which Nature has denied to them at home.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, a company of the&s;e prowlers, who had wandered acro&s;s the great ocean, from the remote&s;t re|gions of the We&s;t, landed upon our coa&s;ts, in want and wretchedne&s;s. The hardine&s;s of &s;uch an undertaking &s;truck us. We received them with humanity. We relieved their nece&s;&s;ities; and gave them the good things of our land, in exchange for trifles, who&s;e only value aro&s;e from their novelty.</P>
<P>Nor did we &s;top there. Engaged by the artifices, and re&s;pecting the un|daunted &s;pirits of tho&s;e our new ac|quaintances, we permitted them to erect habitations on our coa&s;ts, to which they might bring their merchandizes in fu|ture times; and from this ill-judged ho&s;pitality have proceeded all the mi&s;e|ries which at pre&s;ent overwhelm our
<PB N="220" REF="240">
country, and will probably bring it to utter ruin in the end.</P>
<P>The accounts which the&s;e adven|turers gave of our wealth, and ea&s;ine&s;s to part with it, at their return home, encouraged others to make the &s;ame adventure. They came in &s;uch num|bers, as &s;hould have alarmed a ju&s;t &s;u&s;|picion of their de&s;ign. They fortified their habitations, under pretext of de|fence again&s;t injuries never intended them; but in reality to &s;ecure their depredations, and over-awe our &s;ove|reigns, whom they forced to enter into treaty with them, on terms of equality.</P>
<P>Since that time, their conduct hath been a continued &s;eries of the mo&s;t atro|cious crimes. Hardier in their nature, they take advantage of our pu&s;illani|mity and weakne&s;s; and unre&s;trained by tho&s;e obligations, which are the &s;afe|guards of &s;ociety, the a&s;&s;urance of ju&s;|tice and peace, they break through
<PB N="221" REF="241">
every thing which would oppo&s;e their will; and laugh at our credulity, for having thought them capable of good faith.</P>
<P>They grind the faces of the poor. The hu&s;bandman dares not to ta&s;te the fruits of his own labour; the artificer to &s;ell the work of his hands, without their permi&s;&s;ion; a permi&s;&s;ion for which they make the wretches pay &s;o dearly, that all indu&s;try is di&s;couraged, and the ble&s;&s;ings of nature turned into the &s;eve|re&s;t cur&s;e, by being thus withheld from them, though within their reach.</P>
<P>Nor are their outrages confined to the poor. They make our princes pa&s;s under harrows of iron; and lead our kings into captivity to extort their wealth from them. How long Heaven, in its wrath, will &s;uffer them to con|tinue this flagitious cour&s;e, I pre&s;ume not to divine. But this is evident; that if there is not a &s;udden &s;top put to

<Q><P>WHEN I was preparing to depart, the next morning, my ho&s;t a&s;ked me, how long I intended to remain in that city; and with an air of benevolence, offered me every &s;ervice in his power. <Q>As I never interfere with the concerns of any man,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I flatter my|&s;elf, that I am beloved by the people of my own nation.

<P>I was involved in the greate&s;t per|plexity by this propo&s;al. To embrace it mu&s;t put a &s;top to my travels, which was contrary to my firme&s;t re&s;olution, as the time drew near, when I had pro|mi&s;ed to return to my father.

<P>My &s;oul &s;ickened at the &s;ight; and I was almo&s;t driven to give up my pur|po&s;e, and depart, for fear of being infected by &s;uch &s;ociety, when the Bra|min and I were &s;ummoned to our au|dience.</P>
<P>We found the great man lolling on a &s;opha, in all the mimickry of &s;tate; his awkward unea&s;ine&s;s under which, &s;hewed his inexperience in the reality. All was bu&s;tle, hurry, and confu&s;ion. His orders contradicted each other, every moment. He knew not what he ought to approve, and therefore placed his judgment, in finding fault; as he &s;hewed his greatne&s;s by looking with contempt at every thing around him.</P>
<P>Our entrance was announced to his excellency, by a &s;ervant, on a bent

<P><Q>Son of good fortune!</Q> an&s;wered the Bramin, <Q>I have found &s;uch a per&s;on, as you de&s;ired me to &s;eek for you, the la&s;t time I had the honour of paying my duty to your greatne&s;s; and have brought him to receive your com|mands.</Q></P>
<P>His excellency, rolling his eye back and forward from the Bramin to me, for &s;ome moments, with a &s;u&s;picious &s;tare, at length demanded to know, what per&s;on he meant.</P>
<P><Q>A per&s;on,</Q> an&s;wered the Bramin, <Q>who hath travelled through all the

<P><Q>Not I indeed!</Q> replied his excellency, with a look and accent of offended im|portance. <Q>You quite mi&s;under&s;tood me. I want no in&s;truction in &s;uch matters. What I &s;poke to you about, was a &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, who under|&s;tands the languages of tho&s;e countries, and can write my orders to the &s;ove|reigns of them; as I have not time to throw away, on learning their jargon my&s;elf.

<P><Q>The mi&s;take,</Q> returned the Bramin, <Q>is not material. My friend is qualified for either office. His capacity will be found on trial; and I will vouch for his fidelity.</Q></P>

<Q><P>ON our return to the habitation of the Bramin, <Q>As you are now entering into a &s;cene of life,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>utterly new to you; it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to give you a &s;ketch of the character of the man, to whom you are going, in order to direct your conduct toward him.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The manner, in which he bears his pre&s;ent elevation, &s;hews that it is not natural to him. But you mu&s;t not form your judgment of him, in other re&s;pects, from thence; few men ex|hibiting a &s;tronger proof, that &s;uperior talents are far from being the &s;ole pro|perty of the &s;uperior ranks of life.</P>
<P>Born in the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of mankind, and bred to one of the meane&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ions, by which indu&s;trious poverty &s;trive to earn a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he
<PB N="233" REF="253">
has rai&s;ed him&s;elf by the meer force of his own genius, to his pre&s;ent height of affluence, and power; a ri&s;e, it is true, to which his principles have con|tributed little le&s;s than his abilities, as they never re&s;trained him from any thing, by which he could propo&s;e ad|vantage: A qualification, common to almo&s;t all the men, who have been honoured by the world, with the name of <HI>Great.</HI></P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice though to acknow|ledge that the actions by which he has thus rai&s;ed him&s;elf, have, in their fir&s;t effect, merited from his &s;uperiors (for even he, high as he holds him&s;elf here, is no more than the &s;ervant of &s;ubjects in his native country) all the rewards, which they have be&s;towed upon him.</P>
<P>But if we &s;trip tho&s;e actions of the blazonry of &s;ucce&s;s, and mea&s;ure them by the rules of public, as well as pri|vate virtue; we &s;hall find, that by
<PB N="234" REF="254">
blackening ambition with perfidy, cor|rupting private fidelity, and &s;taining victory with murder, he has exceeded in the mo&s;t nefarious iniquity all the ravagers of the earth, who have built their greatne&s;s upon the mi&s;eries of mankind; as the con&s;equence will prove, that in&s;tead of giving &s;anction to &s;uch crimes, by loading him with honours, his &s;uperiors &s;hould have puni&s;hed him with the mo&s;t ignominious death, to have given permanency to the very advantages, he has acquired for them; the divine vengeance, though hitherto &s;u&s;pended, being now ready to bur&s;t in thunder on their heads for this inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>His a&s;&s;ociates, emulous of his &s;ucce&s;s in ama&s;&s;ing wealth, but incapable of effecting it, as he had, by actions at the &s;ame time &s;erviceable to their &s;u|periors, have imitated him in the mo&s;t flagitious parts of his conduct, and laid the axe to the root of the advantages,
<PB N="235" REF="255">
which they drew from this country, by robbing the wretched natives of the means of &s;upplying it; for who will work, when he knows that the fruit of his labour will be ravi&s;hed from him?</P>
<P>Of this, indeed, they &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible them&s;elves. But in&s;tead of be|ing moved by that &s;en&s;e to change their mea&s;ures, they have only changed the object of them.</P>
<P>Seeing that the ruined land can no longer &s;upply matter for their rapacity, they have turned it again&s;t their &s;upe|riors, whom they have brought to the verge of equal ruin, by a peculation of the wealth, entru&s;ted to their care; lavi&s;hing it, in erecting fortre&s;&s;es to guard again&s;t impo&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;aults; and maintaining forces to fight again&s;t ene|mies, who do not exi&s;t, that they may have an opportunity of appointing each other to all the lucrative employments,
<PB N="236" REF="256">
which attend armies, and make war at pre&s;ent, little le&s;s ruinous to the victors, than to the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Thus one is to &s;upply materials, another to &s;uperintend the building; this to provide food, that cloathing for the men; and &s;o on, arms, ammuni|tion, every article po&s;&s;ible to be wanted by an army, for all which, as they are to pay them&s;elves, they contract in the greate&s;t quantities, and at the highe&s;t rates, which mutual connivance can venture to impo&s;e upon common &s;en&s;e; at the &s;ame time, that not one of them hath the remote&s;t intention of fulfilling &s;uch contracts, either in the quantity, or quality of the things to be provided; but &s;uffer the mi&s;erable bands of rob|bers, which they call armies, to &s;truggle with all the &s;everities of climates not natural to them, and the want of every convenience, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life, if they can not plunder them from the defencele&s;s, and therefore more mi&s;e|rable

<P>This faithful repre&s;entation will prove the truth of what I have &s;aid before, that if a &s;udden &s;top be not put to the&s;e ravagers, our country mu&s;t be ruined. In fact, they will &s;oon be forced to &s;top of nece&s;&s;ity.

<Q><P>ON my repairing next morning to the pavillion of the chief, I found him in conver&s;ation with a few of his a&s;&s;ociates, on &s;ome &s;ubject which &s;eemed to embar|ra&s;s them not a little.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he ca&s;t his eyes upon me, he turned &s;hort to the others, and told them, with an exulting look, that I could give them the information they wanted, having travelled lately through all tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>One of his a&s;&s;ociates having pre&s;umed to expre&s;s &s;ome doubt, whether it was &s;afe to entru&s;t a &s;tranger with a matter of &s;uch moment, the &s;agacity of the chief took in&s;tant offence. He a&s;ked, with a &s;upercilious air, When he had been known to be mi&s;taken in any man? Adding, that he had taken me for his &s;ecretary, on the recommen|dation
<PB N="239" REF="259">
of a man of honour: not that I wanted any better voucher, to a man of di&s;cernment, than the hone&s;ty written in my countenance.</P>
<P>The other believing, or at lea&s;t not thinking it proper to di&s;agree with him, a&s;ked me if there was not a pro&s;pect of the greate&s;t plenty, in tho&s;e countries, at the approaching harve&s;t; and on my bowing in affirmation, added a number of que&s;tions, concerning the prices of the different nece&s;&s;aries of life in diffe|rent places.</P>
<P>It in&s;tantly occurred to me, that this was &s;uch an opportunity as I &s;ought, to &s;erve my fellow-traveller. I an&s;wered therefore, that the&s;e were matters with which I was utterly unacquainted, hav|ing never bought any thing but what was immediately nece&s;&s;ary for my own u&s;e, the purpo&s;e of my travelling having been only to indulge curio&s;ity, and ac|quire knowledge: but that I knew a
<PB N="240" REF="260">
per&s;on, who had followed the profe&s;&s;ion of a merchant for many years, and was able to give him every information he could wi&s;h, in every branch of com|merce; and on informing him whom I meant, gave &s;o high a character of the merchant's judgment and probity, that they all &s;eemed inclined to employ him.</P>
<P>But there was a difficulty in my way, which I plainly perceived would defeat my de&s;ign, if it could not be removed. This was his merchandize, which they had &s;eized, and thought he would ex|pect to have re&s;tored to him, before he would enter into their &s;ervice: a &s;acri|fice to ju&s;tice which they could not pre|vail upon them&s;elves to make, to any uncertain pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>On their expre&s;&s;ing doubts, therefore, of the danger of placing confidence in a man utterly unknown to them, I replied, that they had a &s;ecurity for his hone&s;ty in their own hands: that they might re|tain
<PB N="241" REF="261">
his merchandize till he &s;hould exe|cute their commi&s;&s;ion; and then return it, or not, as he &s;hould de&s;erve; by which means they would make it his intere&s;t to be hone&s;t to them.</P>
<P>This thought &s;ettled the whole affair. The chief in&s;tantly approved of my pro|po&s;al, paying a compliment to my judg|ment, in making intere&s;t the be&s;t mo|tive to hone&s;ty; and I was directly &s;ent to conduct the merchant to them.</P></Q>

<Q><P>I cannot expre&s;s what I felt, on enter|ing the dungeon where the unhappy man was confined, even without any charge of a real crime. Dark, damp, and noi&s;ome, it &s;eemed to have been de|&s;igned to render the horrors of impri|&s;onment &s;till more horrible.</P>
<P>In the indignation of my &s;oul at &s;uch tyranny, I could not forbear exclaiming
<PB N="242" REF="262">
in my native language, <Q>What a re|proach is it to human nature, that the men, who have them&s;elves been &s;ubject to the heavy hand of power, are the lea&s;t proper to be entru&s;ted with it over others!</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he heard my well-known voice, he rai&s;ed his head from the ground, on which he lay, loaded with chains; and looking eagerly at me, <Q>Oh, my friend,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>have my mi&s;|fortunes overwhelmed you al&s;o? Is your innocence ruined, merely for hav|ing known &s;uch a wretch as me? And yet, what is my guilt? What have I done, to draw this ruin upon me?</Q></P>
<P>His fears had taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, that it was difficult to unde|ceive him, as to the cau&s;e of my com|ing; difficult to per&s;uade him that there was any pro&s;pect of his being re&s;tored to his liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="263">At length, when he &s;aw his chains taken off, and the doors of the pri&s;on opened to him, a new anxiety &s;eized his &s;oul; <Q>But will they re&s;tore me my effects al&s;o?</Q> &s;aid he, &s;topping &s;hort at the door of the pri&s;on, and fixing his eyes earne&s;tly upon me: <Q>if not, of what advantage is liberty? I had better die here, than be obliged to beg my bread among &s;trangers. My mi&s;ery will be &s;horter, at the lea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>I could &s;carcely &s;uppre&s;s his emotions &s;ufficiently for him to appear before the arbiters of his fate. I &s;oothed! I comforted! I encouraged him to hope the be&s;t; till I in &s;ome mea&s;ure recalled his rea&s;on, and made him pre&s;ent to him&s;elf; for I was not permitted to un|fold to him the immediate occa&s;ion of his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>When at length I introduced him to them, he an&s;wered all their que&s;tions with preci&s;ion; and undertook to exe|cute
<PB N="244" REF="264">
their commi&s;&s;ion without he&s;itation, on condition of having his property re&s;tored to him, at his return with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The nature of this commi&s;&s;ion, and the readine&s;s with which he embraced it, &s;truck me with &s;uch horror, that I re&s;olved directly to &s;eparate my&s;elf both from him and his employers. But that very readine&s;s defeated my de&s;ign. It made them &s;u&s;pect that he wanted only to get out of their power, and therefore they in&s;i&s;ted that I &s;hould remain as an ho&s;tage for his fidelity.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid agreeing to this condition, without ex|po&s;ing him, and probably my&s;elf al&s;o to de&s;truction; as they would naturally have concluded, that we had concerted a &s;cheme to deceive them. I a&s;&s;ented therefore, with an appearance of readi|ne&s;s, to that which I did not dare to refu&s;e; and purcha&s;ed my fellow-tra|veller's
<PB N="245" REF="265">
liberty at the price of my own, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ion entru&s;ted to him was to buy up all the produce of the year from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in order to &s;ell it back to them at an higher price, when their nece&s;&s;ities &s;hould become &s;o pre&s;&s;|ing, as to oblige them to give whatever &s;hould be required for it: the chief hav|ing an a&s;&s;ured per&s;ua&s;ion, that they had buried immen&s;e trea&s;ures in the earth, to evade the exactions of him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem improbable to you, as it did at the time to me, that any people &s;hould be &s;o infatuated, as to put them|&s;elves thus into the power of their known oppre&s;&s;ors, for their very &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; but there is nothing &s;o ab&s;urd, which the force of avarice cannot effect.</P>
<P>The merchant, on my objecting this difficulty, treated it with contempt.

<Q>Give them,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>this day, one penny more than the current price, and they will accept it greedily, without ever con&s;idering what may be the con|&s;equence to-morrow.

Be&s;ide, am I not armed with power to compel them, &s;hould they unexpectedly have the imprudence to refu&s;e complying with my propo&s;als? They are in a &s;nare, out of which they can no way e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P>Nor did he pay greater re&s;pect to the di&s;approbation which I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing, at the readine&s;s with which he undertook &s;uch horrid work.</P>
<P><Q>Your virtue, my friend,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is too refined ever to be carried into practice, when placed in the &s;cale again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful principles of human nature.

<P>The &s;cenes of which I was a melan|choly witne&s;s, while the merchant was engaged in the execution of his com|mi&s;&s;ion, were too horrid for de&s;cription.

<Q><P>THE return of the merchant relea&s;ed me, at length, from the &s;ight of &s;uch mi&s;ery, from the &s;ociety of men, who were a di&s;grace to the human name.</P>
<P>He had executed their commi&s;&s;ion, with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s; and, as I thought, much more faithfully, than
<PB N="248" REF="268">
they performed their promi&s;e of reward|ing him for it.</P>
<P>Every time he claimed the re&s;titution of his merchandize, &s;ome new difficulty was &s;tarted, &s;ome new delay made, under pretences the mo&s;t frivolous, and &s;hame|le&s;s; till growing apprehen&s;ive that they might compleat their inju&s;tice by taking away his life to free them&s;elves from his importunity, he reduced his demand to the means of &s;upport in his return to his native country; their conde&s;cending to grant which, after much entreaty, they affected to con&s;ider, as an act of the greate&s;t genero&s;ity, and favour.</P>
<P>When he was ready to depart, he affectionately pre&s;&s;ed me to accompany him. <Q>Do not be di&s;couraged, my friend,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>at the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of our journey hither. Matters are not &s;o bad, as they may appear to be. I knew my employers too well, to tru&s;t entirely to their ju&s;tice. An

agent under&s;tands but little of his bu&s;ine&s;s, who can not make it pay it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>Had I not before covenanted with my own heart to &s;eparate my&s;elf from him, the very argument on which he re&s;ted his &s;olicitation, would have determined me to decline it. I wi&s;hed him an happy journey, &s;aying that my fate led me another way.</P>
<P>I was too well acquainted with the power of habit over the human heart, to be &s;urprized at this in&s;tance of the merchant's mea&s;uring ju&s;tice by the rule of his own intere&s;t. It was but con|&s;i&s;tency of character. Not that I can &s;ay, I was di&s;plea&s;ed with the con&s;e|quence, how much &s;oever I di&s;approved of the motive of his conduct. His employers, and he, had been guilty of equal breaches of tru&s;t; and I there|fore adored that Power, which thus
<PB N="250" REF="270">
made one act of inju&s;tice puni&s;h an|other.</P>
<P>The condition, upon which I had con&s;ented to &s;tay among the&s;e people, being thus fulfilled, I re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of departing, with|out giving them any notice of my de|&s;ign; being taught by their treatment of the merchant, what confidence was to be placed in their promi&s;es, and appre|hen&s;ive that they might think me too deeply acquainted with the my&s;teries of their iniquity to di&s;mi&s;s me.</P>
<P>While I waited for &s;uch an oppor|tunity, the &s;ucce&s;s of the merchant's commi&s;&s;ion appeared in effects, not to be recollected without horror.</P>
<P>The natives, as he had predicted, either from avarice, or compul&s;ion, had &s;old him all the produce of the land, which his employers no &s;ooner got into
<PB N="251" REF="271">
their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than they rai&s;ed the prices to &s;uch an height, that the wretches, after having expended every re&s;ource to purcha&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible &s;up|port, were reduced to all the dreadful extremities of famine; while the au|thors of their ruin looked on, with un|concern; nor would relax their extortion to &s;ave the very name of the people from being blotted out, from among the inhabitants of the earth.</P>
<P>Virgins offered them&s;elves to violation in the &s;treets, for a mouthful of food. The &s;on &s;old his father into &s;lavery. The mother devoured the infant, which &s;ucked her brea&s;t. The living were not able to bury the dead.</P>
<P>Amid all the&s;e horrors, my &s;oul had a peculiar con&s;olation, for &s;ome time. The jewels, which I had retained by the advice of Myrza, now &s;erved the bene|ficent purpo&s;e, for which he had advi&s;ed me to re&s;erve them. I gave them to
<PB N="252" REF="272">
my friend, the Bramin, who di&s;po&s;ed of them, and applied the price to the relief of the general di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But alas! he proceeded not with &s;uf|ficient &s;ecrecy. He was di&s;covered, by the inhuman tyrants. He was &s;eized. He was put to torture, to di&s;cover if he had any more, and from whom he had received them. He pre&s;erved his faith to me; and died under the torture, without making any di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Unfortunate was it for him, that I knew not of his &s;ufferings, till they were at an end. My life &s;hould not have been &s;aved, at the price of his.</P>
<P>Such &s;cenes are difficult to be believed. The pride of con&s;cious virtue is unwil|ling to admit even a po&s;&s;ibility of the human nature's &s;inking &s;o low. But when it is con&s;idered by whom the&s;e crimes were perpetrated, it will be
<PB N="253" REF="273">
owned, that they were no more, than might have been fore&s;een.</P>
<P>The weight of power is too great to be &s;u&s;tained, under the mo&s;t advan|tageous circum&s;tances. It too often intoxicates the be&s;t head; and warps the be&s;t heart. What then mu&s;t its effects be, in the oppo&s;ite extream? How could it rationally be expected, that men rai&s;ed to ab&s;olute power, from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of &s;ervility, and from the lowe&s;t poverty, &s;hould be able to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of abu&s;ing that power to acquire wealth; when &s;uch abu&s;e was, in a manner, ju&s;tified by practice, and encouraged by impunity?</P></Q>

<Q><P>AS I had been detained by the&s;e events, beyond the time of my pro|mi&s;ed return to my father, I felt the anxiety of his love, for my &s;afety; and therefore, for the greater expedition, embarked &s;ecretly in a &s;hip, which was intended to &s;ail directly for Suez, pre|ferring the performance of &s;o dear a duty to any plea&s;ure or advantage, which I could promi&s;e to my&s;elf, in the further pur&s;uit of my travels.</P>
<P>Heaven &s;eemed at fir&s;t to &s;mile upon our way. We &s;ailed with a favourable wind, till we entered the &s;traits of <HI>Dira,</HI> when a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, which in de&s;pite of all the efforts of our ma|riners, who &s;truggled with it, for &s;eve|ral days, at length drove our &s;hip upon &s;ome rocks, where &s;he was in&s;tantly torn to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="275">It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe what I felt in that dreadful moment. The darkne&s;s of midnight was conden&s;ed tenfold, by the fury of the &s;torm. All was horror, and di&s;may.</P>
<P>Though the mo&s;t re&s;olute had lo&s;t every hope of e&s;caping; we all, in the in&s;tinctive impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, laid hold on &s;uch pieces of the wreck, as chance threw in our way, and cling|ing to them, were driven about at the mercy of the winds and waves, in which many peri&s;hed by a milder death, than awaited mo&s;t of tho&s;e who gained the land.</P>
<P>It was my fate, to be thrown upon the &s;hore, without any appearance of life; a &s;ituation, to which, as I after|wards found, I owed my &s;afety.</P>
<P>The day had ju&s;t begun to dawn, when I recovered my &s;en&s;es, the fir&s;t efforts of which &s;erved only to pre&s;ent
<PB N="256" REF="276">
me with &s;cenes &s;till more horrible, than that from which I had e&s;caped. I found my&s;elf entirely naked, at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the &s;ea, whither, I &s;up|po&s;e, I mu&s;t have been dragged for the better convenience of &s;tripping off my cloaths.</P>
<P>But this treatment, however cruel in it&s;elf, was kindne&s;s in compari&s;on, of what I &s;aw inflicted on my unhappy companions, as many of whom as reached the &s;hore alive, were in&s;tantly &s;laughtered, and then &s;tripped by the natives, who in&s;tead of relieving a &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s, which &s;hould have moved every humane pa&s;&s;ion, looked upon them, and their property, as lawful prey.</P>
<P>Shocked as my &s;oul was, at &s;uch bar|barity, nature directed my fir&s;t thoughts to my own &s;afety. I lay, as motionle&s;s as if I was really dead, till I &s;aw the &s;avages depart, laden with the &s;poils of the wretches, whom they had &s;laugh|tered;
<PB N="257" REF="277">
when rai&s;ing my&s;elf, as well as weakne&s;s and the pain of many brui&s;es would permit, I crept to the &s;ea &s;ide to try if I could happily admini&s;ter relief, to any, who might have e&s;caped, in the &s;ame manner with my&s;elf, and find &s;ome cloaths to cover me, which had been over-looked by the ravagers, in the hurry of their rapacity.</P>
<P>But I was di&s;appointed at the fir&s;t in either hope. They were too well ex|perienced in the work, to leave it un|fini&s;hed; and I was ju&s;t going to depart, though I knew not whither, when ca&s;ting my eyes, once more, wi&s;hfully to the &s;ea, I thought I perceived &s;omething floating toward the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The &s;torm having by this time nearly &s;pent its force, I ventured into the water to &s;ee, what the object before me might be; when I found one of my fellow-pa&s;&s;engers, with whom I had contracted a particular intimacy, with his arms
<PB N="258" REF="278">
cla&s;ped round a coffer, to which he was tied. I in&s;tantly rai&s;ed his head, above the water, and perceiving &s;ome &s;igns of life, exerted all my &s;trength, to draw him up on the dry land, where my care &s;oon re&s;tored him to his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>The moment he opened his eyes, and &s;aw me bu&s;ied about him, his &s;ituation &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to him in the wor&s;t light, my being naked preventing his knowing me; and making him imagine I was one of the &s;poilers, with who&s;e nefarious practices he was too well acquainted. Lifting his hands therefore, in a &s;up|pliant manner, <Q>O! &s;pare my life,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>&s;pare the life of an old man, who will never di&s;turb your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what you have acquired.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What!</Q> I returned: <Q>Do you not know me? Can Ha&s;&s;an be taken for a &s;poiler, by his friend?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="279">He &s;tarted, on hearing my voice; and looking eagerly at me, <Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible?</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>Can I be &s;o happy? But where is the coffer to which I was bound? If that is lo&s;t, my life is of little value to me.</Q></P>
<P>I then &s;hewed him the coffer, where it &s;till lay in the water, upon which he aro&s;e with a vigour, not to have been expected from his &s;ituation, and running toward it, <Q>Let us then &s;ecure it in|&s;tantly,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>before the &s;poilers come, or they will not only rob us of all it contains, but murder us al&s;o, to &s;ecure the &s;poil.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had drawn it to the land, he opened the locks, and taking out a ca&s;ket, put it into his bo&s;om, and was preparing to depart, without &s;eeming even to think of any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="280">Such an in&s;en&s;ibility to the &s;ituation I was in, affected me. <Q>How!</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>and will my friend de&s;ert me, thus naked and alone?</Q></P>
<P>He &s;tarted; and pau&s;ing for a mo|ment, as if ju&s;t awakened from a dream, <Q>De&s;ert you!</Q> he returned; <Q>no, never will I de&s;ert my pre&s;erver. But what can we do? The &s;poilers will come upon us, the moment they di&s;cover that our &s;hip has been wrecked. The vulture is not more quick to find his prey, nor the tyger more cruel, than the inhabitants of the &s;ea-coa&s;ts to de|&s;troy tho&s;e, whom the more merciful waves throw into their power.</Q></P>
<P>I then acquainted him, that they had been already there, &s;hewing him the &s;laughtered bodies on the &s;hore, to which I added my own condition, as proofs of their bloody rapacity.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="281">His thoughts were &s;o intently fixed upon him&s;elf, that he &s;eemed to have no feeling for the misfortunes of any other. <Q>Thank heaven,</Q> &s;aid he, embracing the ca&s;ket, <Q>that we have e&s;caped though; and that my jewels are &s;afe! But we mu&s;t not remain here! As &s;oon as they have left their &s;poil at home, they will return, to try if they can glean up any more. I will &s;hare my garments with thee for the pre&s;ent. We &s;hall &s;oon be able to procure every thing we want.</Q></P>
<P>He was proceeding to &s;trip him&s;elf, when the occa&s;ion was unhappily re|moved. The &s;ea threw up, near to the place where we &s;tood, the body of one of our companions, whom finding to be dead, I yielded to the horrid ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking his cloaths to cover my&s;elf.</P></Q>

<Q><P>WE had not advanced far into the country, before we di&s;covered a cottage, the poor appearance of which &s;hewed the poverty of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>On our approaching the door, which &s;tood open to give light to the family, whom we found &s;eated around a little fire, at a meal of &s;imple vegetables, the ma&s;ter invited us in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner to partake of his humble fare.</P>
<P>Though I knew him, at the fir&s;t ca&s;t of my eye, to be one of tho&s;e, who had been mo&s;t active in murdering and &s;poiling my unhappy companions, my a&s;toni&s;hment was not greater at the pre|&s;ent contra&s;t in his conduct, than to hear him addre&s;s us, in the Byr&s;an language.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="283">'Gracious heaven!' I exclaimed, 'where am I? Is it po&s;&s;ible that this is the country of the Byr&s;ans? That &s;uch barbarous crimes &s;hould be committed, in defiance of the mo&s;t beneficent laws?'</P>
<P>The cottager, who knew not the cau&s;e of my exclamation, appeared to be &s;ur|prized; nor made me any an&s;wer, till I repeated my que&s;tion, when he in|formed me, that I was in my native country.</P>
<P>But my companion, who under&s;tood my meaning, having often heard me boa&s;t of the laws of Byr&s;a, as &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all other nations, would not mi&s;s &s;uch an occa&s;ion of reproving my vain partiality. <Q>Why &s;hould not &s;uch crimes,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>be committed in this country, as &s;oon as in any other? It is not the laws, but the execution of them, which hath an effect upon the manners of a people. The be&s;t laws, if badly admini&s;tered, only encourage
<PB N="264" REF="284">
the crimes, which they were de&s;igned to prevent.</Q></P>
<P>The cottager, having directed us the way to Byr&s;a, returned to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, to &s;eek for more &s;poil, in contempt of every argument, I could u&s;e to di&s;|&s;uade him; while we proceeded toward the hou&s;e of my father, my heart pant|ing with filial love and joy, at the thought of being &s;o near him.</P>
<P>The contradiction between the conduct of the cottager, when at home, and on the &s;hore, was &s;o &s;triking, that I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize to my companion, who accounted for it, in a manner mo&s;t di&s;graceful to the polity of any civilized people.</P>
<P><Q>The nature of man,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>is in it&s;elf benevolent. Cruelty is ever the con&s;equence of error in opinion or of bad example. In his cottage you &s;aw this man, in his natural character.

His conduct, on the &s;hore, proceeded from a notion derived from the laws of times of ignorance, and barbarity, that the plunderers could not be compelled to make re&s;titution of their &s;poil, if no man belonging to a &s;hip, which was wrecked, remained alive to claim it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If then, the legi&s;lature of Byr&s;a really merited the prai&s;e, which you have &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed upon it, would not proper means have been taken to eradicate &s;uch a notion, and prevent its horrid con&s;equences, by confi&s;cating to the &s;tate every wreck, where all the people peri&s;hed; and on the other hand, allowing a part thereof to the inhabitants of the coa&s;t, in pro|portion to the number of lives &s;aved by them; in&s;tead of the pre&s;ent ab&s;urd method of puni&s;hment for plundering, which they evade by murdering all, who might prove their guilt?</Q></P>

<Q><P>MY meeting with my father is not to be de&s;cribed. He had been for &s;ome time &s;inking under the infirmities of age; and &s;eemed to have &s;truggled to pre&s;erve life, only till he could re&s;ign it, in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The moment he was informed of my arrival, he called me eagerly to him; and throwing his arms around my neck, as I kneeled by the &s;ide of his bed, <Q>It is enough!</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>Gracious hea|ven, it is enough. I embrace him once more; and now I die content.</Q>&mdash;</P>

<Q><P>I have informed you of the claim, which the Byr&s;ans made to the neigh|bouring country of the Coptes. It had plea&s;ed heaven to lead me home, ju&s;t as their army was preparing to march, to inforce that claim.</P>
<P>Though I had determined upon a retired life, the principles, in which I had been educated by my father, mak|ing me di&s;approve a mea&s;ure, &s;o con|trary to ju&s;tice, I thought it my fir&s;t duty to endeavour to prevent it, before
<PB N="270" REF="292">
I would attend to any thing, which re|lated &s;olely to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved therefore to demand an audience of the king, to whom my rank in the &s;tate gave me a right of &s;peaking my &s;entiments on public af|fairs; and lay before him the rea&s;ons of my di&s;&s;enting from the general voice, on &s;o important an occa&s;ion; not doubt|ing but I &s;hould be able to open his eyes to the evils, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The war appeared to me &s;o flagrantly unju&s;t, that I imagined there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;ecret rea&s;ons for it, to which my ab&s;ence had made me a &s;tranger, or it could never have been re&s;olved on. Before, therefore, I would pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e it, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to en|quire more particularly into the matter, as I knew the danger of judging, on a partial view.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="293">For this purpo&s;e I went directly to a per&s;on, who&s;e having held &s;everal of the fir&s;t offices in the &s;tate, I concluded mu&s;t enable him to give me the information I wanted; and which an alliance be|tween our hou&s;es gave me a right to require.</P>
<P>On entering his habitation, I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find every thing wear a gloomy a&s;pect. The very looks of the &s;ervants &s;poke an unhappy ma&s;ter. He received me, with an air of dignity and re&s;pect, but clouded with a re&s;erve, which made it di&s;agreeable, and &s;eemed de&s;irous to confine his conver&s;ation to general que&s;|tions, relating to the countries, which I had &s;een in my travels.</P>
<P>This, however, gave me an ea&s;y op|portunity of leading him to the &s;ubject of the approaching war, without ex|pre&s;sly declaring the purpo&s;e of my coming, which I apprehended might have made him &s;till more re&s;erved: I
<PB N="272" REF="294">
therefore, as occa&s;ionally, de&s;ired to know his opinion of it, as a direction to mine, which, probably for want of proper information, I owned to be again&s;t it.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t mention of the affair, I &s;aw his eyes &s;parkle with indignation, which aro&s;e as I proceeded, till it en|tirely di&s;&s;ipated the gloom, which hung upon his brow, and broke through his re&s;erve.</P>
<P><Q>I am happy,</Q> &s;aid he, with a look of the warme&s;t complacency, <Q>to find your &s;entiments concur with mine, on this important occa&s;ion, for, if you are not &s;atisfied with the apparent, much le&s;s will you be, with the real motives of this war. The former have at lea&s;t &s;omething like a colour, how|ever fal&s;e, of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to deceive the people, who can never be led into any thing, which they know to be unju&s;t, how ea&s;ily &s;oever
<PB N="273" REF="295">
they may be deceived; but the latter are a my&s;tery of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t iniquity, in every &s;en&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Good heaven!</Q> I returned; <Q>Whence can this proceed? The youth of our &s;overeign opened with the faire&s;t hopes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor hath he ever fallen from tho&s;e hopes!</Q> interrupted he, eagerly. <Q>One vice hath never &s;tained his private life, one act of inju&s;tice warped his public conduct. Yet &s;till, a character, le&s;s pure, might have proved more advan|tageous to his people. To form a pro|per judgment of a man, his &s;tation mu&s;t be con&s;idered. The virtues mo&s;t &s;ublime in a &s;ubject, are often but amiable weakne&s;&s;es in a &s;overeign.</Q></P>
<Q><P>I &s;ee that your ab&s;ence hath made you a &s;tranger to the &s;ecret &s;prings, upon which our government moves at this time. The balance between its parts, and their mutual check upon
<PB N="274" REF="296">
each other, which gave it the pre-emi|nence over all the other governments upon earth, exi&s;t now only in name.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior council, by di&s;&s;ipating the property, appointed to &s;upport its independance, is fallen ab&s;olutely under the influence of the crown; as the in|ferior daily betrays to it the tru&s;t com|mitted to them, to acquire matter for a like di&s;&s;ipation; the gratification of luxury being the only object attended to by every cla&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>You may naturally conclude that the power of the &s;overeign mu&s;t become ab&s;olute by this pro&s;tration of the fences, in&s;tituted to re&s;train it. But the contrary is the fact. All the power, which he &s;eems to obtain in this man|ner, is wa&s;ted in the very means, made u&s;e of to obtain it; and him&s;elf kept in a kind of &s;lavery to the in&s;truments of this corruption, in which they have &s;o entangled the whole &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment,

that it now appears to be one of its fir&s;t principles; and often compels him to give the &s;anction of his name and authority to mea&s;ures, the mo&s;t contrary to his own &s;entiments; of which there can not be a &s;tronger in&s;tance, than this war, which is lite|rally forced upon him, by his &s;ervants, though as contrary to their inclinations, as to his; their ambition and abilities being equally limited to the dark works of &s;eduction.</P>
<P>But the people have of late begun to look &s;o narrowly into their conduct, and to &s;hew &s;uch &s;ymptoms of di&s;con|tent, that apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;e|quence, they adopted this expedient to turn the attention of the public from them&s;elves, blazoning the war, with &s;uch hopes of private advantage, as have made the inju&s;tice of it ea&s;ily pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="298">Nor is the power of this hope to be wondered at. We have lived &s;o far before-hand, that it is terrifying to look forward.

<P>The horrid re&s;olution, with which he concluded this melancholy repre&s;enta|tion, aggravated the pain it gave me, ten thou&s;and fold.

<Q><P>I was diverted from the painful re|flections, which &s;uch a &s;cene naturally &s;ugge&s;ted, at my return, by the entrance of a per&s;on, who had been one of the mo&s;t intimate acquaintances of my early youth.</P>
<P>As I had been informed, that he had wa&s;ted his fortune, in every mode of idle di&s;&s;ipation and expence, I was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urprized at his appearance, every thing in which &s;poke affluence, and a mind at ea&s;e. He &s;aluted me with the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of regard; and we in&s;tantly continued our former intimacy, as if it had never been inter|rupted.</P>
<P>After &s;ome reciprocal inquiries of per&s;onal affection, I informed him of the conver&s;ation, which had pa&s;&s;ed, at
<PB N="280" REF="302">
the vi&s;it, from which I was ju&s;t re|turned.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a few moments, as &s;truck by what I had &s;aid, then with a look not well a&s;&s;ured, <Q>I &s;hall not pretend,</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q>to vindicate in all things, either the mea&s;ures of the government, or the manners of the age! But the motives of this per&s;on's di&s;approbation, greatly weaken the force of it. He &s;peaks from the rage of di&s;appointment, not from principle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That political corruption, again&s;t which he inveighs with &s;uch acrimony, did he him&s;elf carry to &s;uch lengths, when in power, that it was too gro&s;s to be &s;upported; and occa&s;ioned his de|po&s;al; nor is there a moral vice, which hath not &s;tained his character; but as &s;ome of the&s;e vices have been retorted again&s;t him&s;elf, and he is no longer permitted to practi&s;e that corruption, he now declaims again&s;t it, in this
<PB N="281" REF="303">
manner. But you mu&s;t not tru&s;t too implicitly to his repre&s;entations. Be|cau&s;e the world does not go, as he likes, he mode&s;tly &s;ays it is going to ruin.</Q></P>
<P>The human heart is &s;o fond of hap|pine&s;s, that we give ea&s;y credit to what we wi&s;h. I looked upon the gloomy picture, which had been drawn to me, to have proceeded meerly from the clouds, which over-ca&s;t the painter's mind; and did not doubt but my friend would &s;et every thing in a very differ|ent light.</P>
<P>I therefore de&s;ired him to acquaint me, if there were any rea&s;ons for the approaching war, be&s;ide tho&s;e publicly given, which I &s;crupled not to &s;ay were &s;o flagrantly unju&s;t, that I had re&s;olved to exert my utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="304"><Q>My dear friend,</Q> he an&s;wered, &s;taring at me with <Q>&s;urprize, what you &s;ay, may po&s;&s;ibly be very true; but the&s;e are matters, about which I never give my&s;elf any trouble.</Q></P>
<P>'How!' I returned, a&s;toni&s;hed at what he &s;aid, 'not give your&s;elf trouble about matters of the greate&s;t importance to a &s;tate, in which you hold &s;o high a rank? In the government of which you have ever undertaken a part, not to be executed without trouble? You are not; you can not be &s;erious! But this is a &s;ubject, mo&s;t improper for plea&s;antry!'</P>
<P><Q>I &s;peak my &s;entiments, I a&s;&s;ure you!</Q> he replied. <Q>I never did, nor ever will give my&s;elf trouble about any thing. If I would have taken trouble, with matters of this nature, I might probably have conducted them my&s;elf. My purpo&s;e is to enjoy the plea&s;ures
<PB N="283" REF="305">
of life, while I can, without troubling my&s;elf about con&s;equences, which all my trouble may not be able to pre|vent.</Q></P>
<P>'But!' &s;aid I, interrupting him &s;hortly: 'If you were determined not to take trouble, why did you take an office, which required it? You know my plainne&s;s! Is it con&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour, or even with common hone&s;ty to take the wages, without doing the work?'</P>
<P><Q>You were always an enthu&s;ia&s;t!</Q> he an&s;wered with a forced &s;mile; <Q>and I find you will ever remain one. I was in hope, that &s;eeing the world would have opened your mind; and &s;hewn you the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch antiquated notions. I took the office, becau&s;e I had occa&s;ion for the emoluments of it; as the vi&s;ier gave it, to attach me to his intere&s;t: And on the &s;ame terms, is every office given and accepted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="306"><Q>If you imagine, that any one under the vi&s;ier pre&s;umes, in virtue of his office, to do any thing, you are utterly mi&s;taken.

<Q><Q><P>BUT let us wave a &s;ubject, on which we only wa&s;te our time. I have come to reque&s;t a favour from you, which I promi&s;e my&s;elf you will not refu&s;e me.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, that I am in one of the mo&s;t whim&s;ical &s;ituations, po&s;|&s;ible to be conceived. You remember our old friend Mago. The intimacy, which begun with our lives, hath con|tinued to this day; though it was lately endangered by one of the odde&s;t acci|dents, which ever happened. Can you
<PB N="285" REF="307">
think it po&s;&s;ible, that he and I &s;hould fall in love with each other's wife, and &s;ucceed in our loves too?</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, matters went on, as &s;moothly as we could wi&s;h, neither of us &s;u&s;pecting the other, till growing too &s;ecure, he happened one day to &s;urprize his wife and me in a &s;ituation of more familiarity, than common forms allow. You know his ha&s;ty tem|per. He drew his &s;abre in&s;tantly, and advanced to attack me.</P>
<P>I am not a coward: but I know not how it happened. A qualm of con|&s;cience I &s;uppo&s;e came upon me; and I did not care to run the hazard of lo&s;ing my own life in &s;o fooli&s;h a cau&s;e, or adding his death to the injury I had already done him.</P>
<P>I therefore demanded a parley, &s;word in hand; and after &s;ome preliminaries, in making which I believe I looked
<PB N="286" REF="308">
&s;illy enough, I frankly told him, that in the way he &s;ought &s;atisfaction, the odds were again&s;t him; but that if he would take my advice, I could direct him to a better, which would bring us more upon a level; this was, to return me in kind the good office I had done him; and then there would be nothing to complain of, on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The look he gave me, as I &s;aid this, is not to be de&s;cribed. He fixed his eyes upon me, for a few moments, to &s;ee if I was &s;erious, then bur&s;ting into a loud laugh, 'Give me your hand, brother;' &s;aid he: 'I applaud your prudence; and to tell you a &s;ecret, have not waited for your permi&s;&s;ion, to do what you propo&s;e. So let us e'en &s;hake hands, and make the be&s;t of our bar|gains.'</P>
<P>From that day, all was harmony and good-fellow&s;hip between us; to make which, as we thought, the &s;tronger, and
<PB N="287" REF="309">
as the affair had &s;ome way taken wind, we repudiated our own wives re&s;pec|tively, and wedded tho&s;e of each other, to &s;atisfy their delicacy, and repair their reputations.&mdash;</P></Q>
<P>My indignation, which had been ri&s;ing &s;till higher, at every word he &s;poke, could be re&s;trained no longer. 'How,' I exclaimed, 'wed a woman of who&s;e di&s;honour you were your&s;elf a witne&s;s! What! though you were an accomplice in her guilt, your partici|pation le&s;&s;ened not the crime in her; nor can you expect that &s;he will be more faithful to you, than &s;he was to your friend. In the fir&s;t &s;tep is all the dif|ficulty. A woman, who hath once &s;urmounted that, &s;eldom feels any re|luctance to proceed in the &s;ame way. Be&s;ide your own honour&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>You are too &s;queami&s;h! quite too &s;queami&s;h!</Q> he interrupted, not de|&s;iring to hear more. <Q>The world is
<PB N="288" REF="310">
grown wi&s;er, than to view the&s;e matters in &s;o &s;erious a light, as formerly. How can a man's honour be injured by the levity of a woman? That is another of tho&s;e antiquated ab&s;urdities, which are now only laughed at; and you will &s;oon be a&s;hamed of.</Q></P>
<Q><P>As to her future conduct, that is her own affair. If &s;he &s;hould be caught tripping, &s;he knows the con&s;equence. What is pa&s;t is nothing. Cu&s;tom has &s;anctified the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>But to return to my purpo&s;e. The mi&s;chief now is, that this &s;econd mar|riage has &s;poiled all. Whether it is the thought of re&s;traint, or that there is &s;omething di&s;gu&s;ting in the name of matrimony, I know not; but &s;o it hath happened, that we were all &s;oon &s;ur|feited of our exchange; and wi&s;hed for our own back again.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="311">Now as this is a new ca&s;e, which will create a good deal of impertinent noi&s;e, and be attended with much trouble and delay, what I propo&s;e is to have a law made, which &s;hall authorize an exchange of wives, as often as all the parties are willing; and then the num|bers, who, I know, will take advan|tage of it, will keep us in coun|tenance.</P>
<P>The favour, therefore, which I have to reque&s;t of you, is to introduce the matter for me to the legi&s;lature, as a thought of your own, which occurred to you, in your travels, on ob&s;erving the evils, which univer&s;ally attend in|di&s;&s;oluble marriages.</P>
<P>The &s;obriety of your character will give weight to the &s;cheme; and obviate the per&s;onal allu&s;ions which would be made, if I were to take the lead in it my&s;elf. You may al&s;o, to make the
<PB N="290" REF="312">
thing &s;till more popular, add, that no &s;ingle man &s;hall &s;uffer for having an amour with a married woman, pro|vided he will take her off her hu&s;band's hands, and marry her him&s;elf, which will endear you to all ranks of people, much more than oppo&s;ing the war; &s;uch marriages, though allowed at pre&s;ent, and &s;ometimes practi&s;ed, being attended with &s;o much trouble and expence, that very few can afford them, whereby many a wife is obliged to baulk her in|clinations, and many an hu&s;band to wear his horns in &s;ilence, for want of &s;uch a law to relieve them.</P></Q></Q>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV.</HEAD>
<Q><P>I know not whether my indignation or contempt was mo&s;t moved by this propo&s;al. 'Such a law, as you mention,' I replied, '&s;eems to be the only thing wanted to compleat that di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, which marks the character of the Byr&s;an nation, with deeper di&s;grace, than ever di&s;honoured any other people.</P>
<P>A legi&s;lature, which had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of honour, in&s;tead of authori&s;ing, would u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means to prevent &s;uch infamous marriages. Marriages, which defeat the very intention of mar|riage, by providing a reward for that breach of faith, which it was in&s;tituted to prevent.</P>
<P>The law, too evidently nece&s;&s;ary, is to brand public vice, with public in|famy;
<PB N="292" REF="314">
and prevent a repetition of the breach of matrimonial fidelity, by pro|hibiting the offender from ever marry|ing again. Indeed, &s;o &s;acred &s;hould the honour of the female &s;ex be held, that a woman, who could &s;o far forget her own dignity, as to &s;uffer &s;eduction even in a &s;tate of freedom, and without the additional guilt of conjugal infidelity, &s;hould not be admitted to marry even with her &s;educer. As the crime is in|delible, the puni&s;hment &s;hould be in|evitable.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;en&s;e of that people, who&s;e &s;uperior virtue over-turned the di&s;&s;olute city of Carthage, and forced our ance&s;tors to fly from their native country; a fate, which evidently threa|tens their degenerate offspring, and this more di&s;&s;olute city of Byr&s;a.'&mdash;Saying which I turned away in di&s;dain, waving my hand to him to depart.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="315">The horror, with which I was &s;truck by the conver&s;ation of the&s;e men, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I held it as im|po&s;&s;ible, that a &s;tate, in which the only firm bond of human connection, moral virtue, is univer&s;ally broken, &s;hould not &s;eparate, and fall to ruin; as I know it to be, for any other than religious principles to &s;upport man, through the evils inevitably incident to his nature; a truth, confirmed by too many melan|choly in&s;tances among the Byr&s;ans, who ignorant of the illimitable extent of divine mercy, or not daring to look up to it, &s;unk into de&s;pair, on the lighte&s;t di&s;appointment; and ra&s;hly threw away lives, which a better &s;en&s;e might have rendered happy to them&s;elves, and u&s;e|ful to their country.</P>
<P>Di&s;couraged as I was by the&s;e reflec|tions, I knew it to be my duty not to de&s;pair of the public welfare, or relax my endeavours to promote it; and there|fore
<PB N="294" REF="316">
re&s;olved to go without farther delay to the king, and lay my &s;entiments of the war before him.</P>
<P>As I was departing from my own habitation for this purpo&s;e, I was &s;topped by a &s;tranger, who &s;aid, with a my&s;te|rious look, that he had an affair of im|portance to impart to me.</P>
<P>On my retiring with him, into an inner chamber, he told me, he was &s;orry to trouble me, on a di&s;agreeable occa&s;ion; but that his friend&s;hip for the per&s;on who had ju&s;t left me, would not permit his refu&s;ing to come from him, to demand &s;atisfaction for my treatment of him, in our la&s;t conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Such a demand &s;truck me with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. I an&s;wered, that his friend mu&s;t certainly be mi&s;taken, as I could not charge my&s;elf with having
<PB N="295" REF="317">
treated him, or any other man ill, in my life.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he thought I was terrified, and therefore that he might the more &s;afely pre&s;s upon me. He replied with an haughty air, that his friend had too high a &s;en&s;e of honour to be &s;atisfied with &s;o poor an eva&s;ion, and that I mu&s;t either in&s;tantly meet him, or take the con&s;equence of my cowar|dice.</P>
<P>But he overacted his part. Such a menace, in&s;tead of fear or re&s;entment, rai&s;ed only my contempt. I an&s;wered him with the colde&s;t indifference, that I was &s;urprized to hear honour attributed to a man, who by his own confe&s;&s;ion had forfeited every claim to it; and that if he thought him&s;elf aggrieved by my treatment of him, he mu&s;t correct the conduct, which had given occa&s;ion
<PB N="296" REF="318">
for it; and then he need not fear meet|ing the like from me again.</P>
<P>Such a repul&s;e &s;hewed him his error. Lowering the tone of his voice, he &s;aid, <Q>he hoped I would con&s;ider that it was a delicate point; and wi&s;hed &s;ome method could be found to adju&s;t it, without coming to extre|mities.</Q></P>
<P>But this moderation was affected too late. I replied, that I knew no me|thod, but that which I had propo&s;ed of his changing his conduct in life, upon which I would certainly change mine to him; and not till then; and that as for the con&s;equences, which he had thought proper to threaten, I gave my&s;elf no concern about them, as I had too ju&s;t a re&s;pect for true honour to pay any to the &s;hadow, which he affected to wor&s;hip, or &s;ubmit my own principles to public opinion, by de&s;cending to put
<PB N="297" REF="319">
my&s;elf on a level with a man, who had given up every thing really re&s;pectable, in the human character.</P>
<P>This was an an&s;wer, he &s;eemed not to have been prepared for. He pau&s;ed for &s;ome minutes, as if con&s;idering what to reply; and then withdrew without even attempting to &s;peak another word.</P></Q>

<Q><P>AS &s;oon as the agitation, naturally rai&s;ed by &s;uch a &s;cene, had &s;ub&s;ided, I went to the king; and in the humility of loyal duty examined before him the cau&s;e, and looked forward to the con|&s;equences of the war; and having &s;hewn that the&s;e were as dangerous, as that was unju&s;t, be&s;ought him to inter|po&s;e his authority to prevent it.</P>
<P>He heard me with attention; and even &s;eemed &s;truck with what I &s;aid; but without attempting to refute it, an&s;wered in general terms, that the war was al|ready re&s;olved upon; and the minds of the people &s;o intent upon it, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Severely as I was affected by this re|pul&s;e, it was not the only thing which gave me pain, on the occa&s;ion. No
<PB N="299" REF="321">
&s;ooner was my di&s;approbation of the war known, than I was appointed to a prin|cipal command in the army prepared to carry it on.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on, unacquainted with the principles, which prevailed among the Byr&s;ans, at that time, this mu&s;t appear a de&s;igned in&s;ult. But no &s;uch thing was thought of; it was intended as a mark of re&s;pect; as a gratification of the purpo&s;e of my oppo&s;ition. This mu&s;t be explained.</P>
<P>There is no human in&s;titution, how|ever wi&s;e, and &s;alutary in its natural effects, which the depravity of man can not pervert to the mo&s;t pernicious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The great council, which Narbal had appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;overeign, in the difficulties of government, with their advice; and watch over the intere&s;ts of
<PB N="300" REF="322">
the people, with which they, as a part, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be better acquainted than he could be, often acted directly contrary to that intention, lo&s;ing all con&s;equence under a &s;pirited and poli|tic prince; and on the other hand, when one of a different character offered op|portunity, ri&s;ing upon his weakne&s;s, and u&s;urping the power, while he had only the name of &s;overeignty.</P>
<P>In the former in&s;tance, honorary di&s;|tinctions, and the emoluments of go|vernment always afforded a prince, who had abilities to apply them properly, the means of influencing the members of the council, and making them &s;ub|&s;ervient to his purpo&s;e; but tho&s;e, which they employed again&s;t him, may not be &s;o obvious to you, though they were equally ready.</P>
<P>As the council had a right to delibe|rate upon the mea&s;ures of government,
<PB N="301" REF="323">
it was ea&s;y for a de&s;igning member to carp at &s;uch, as though nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;trictly ju&s;t, might appear exceptionable to a &s;uperficial view; in which he was &s;ure of being followed by the unthink|ing populace, as the tutelary a&s;&s;ertor and guardian of their rights; till they rai&s;ed him to &s;uch a con&s;equence, as enabled him to enhance the price of his ac|quie&s;cence with the will of the prince, or perhaps wre&s;t his authority out of his hands.</P>
<P>Nothing could be a &s;tronger proof of the wi&s;dom of Narbal, than that even &s;o gro&s;s an abu&s;e of his in&s;titution was not &s;ufficient to counterbalance the advantages, ari&s;ing from this council, and make the abolition of it nece&s;&s;ary; the very means, by which this abu&s;e was perpetrated, preventing the obvious and wor&s;t con&s;equences of it; and pre|&s;erving the great principles of the go|vernment from being lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="324">For in order to acquire this popularity, it was nece&s;&s;ary to explain tho&s;e princi|ples to the people, who &s;oon &s;aw their intere&s;t, and ability to pre&s;erve them; and though they joined in their abu&s;e, would never have &s;ubmitted to their being fundamentally overturned.</P>
<P>On this &s;y&s;tem therefore the vi&s;ier judging of me, by all tho&s;e, who had on other occa&s;ions oppo&s;ed public mea|&s;ures, concluded that the readie&s;t way of gaining me to his intere&s;t, was to give me this command, the incon&s;i&s;tency of my accepting which, with my op|po&s;ition to the war, was &s;ufficiently countenanced by the general practice.</P>
<P>But &s;uch an example had no weight with me; and I refu&s;ed his offer with indignation, till my &s;overeign him&s;elf conde&s;cending to reque&s;t my compliance, per&s;onal re&s;pect to him, and a &s;en&s;e of the &s;acred duty of &s;ubjection, obliged
<PB N="303" REF="325">
me to accept it, however contrary to my inclination.</P>
<P><Q>How blind,</Q> interrupted Temugin, <Q>will attachment to a favourite &s;y&s;tem make the be&s;t informed mind? This man, who wanted not wi&s;dom in other matters, could &s;ee no imperfection, in the principles of a government, which teemed with the cau&s;e of its own di&s;&s;o|lution, from the fir&s;t hour it was in&s;ti|tuted. A &s;tate, in which the power of the &s;overeign can be counterbalanced by that of his &s;ubjects, is like a body without an head, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall to ruin.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I will hear the conclu&s;ion of his &s;tory at &s;ome other time.</Q></P></Q>
