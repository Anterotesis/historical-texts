<P>THE Publication of "Ob&s;ervations on the Cure of the Crooked Spine," which were adver|ti&s;ed, has been delayed &s;ome &s;hort time, that the opportunity might be taken of accompanying them with remarks on the following &s;ubject, which have been rather ha&s;tily drawn up, that they might ap|pear before the winter &s;ea&s;on, as they were thought important and intere&s;ting, in no &s;mall degree, to every family, more e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent times, on account of the prevailing fa&s;hion in female dre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE object of the en&s;uing pages is to endeavour to prevent or le&s;&s;en the de&s;tructive effect of fire, when applied to the human body, by means which &s;eem to be not gene|rally known, or not &s;ufficiently attended to.</P>
<P>There are few accidents or maladies to which mankind are &s;ubject, which have met with a greater variety of treatment than burns; and, as it appears to me, the&s;e various methods have in general been received and adopted as things of cour&s;e, and handed down without any fixed principle or determined idea annexed to them: as we continually &s;ee
<PB N="2" REF="6">in &s;imilar ca&s;es of burns, &s;calds, &amp;c. applica|tions made u&s;e of which entirely vary from each other in their nature and effect.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the ancient writers on this &s;ubject, we find a great variety of remedies, con&s;i&s;ting of decoctions of different herbs and ointments of various ingredients, many of which form compo&s;itions totally oppo&s;ite to each other; but which were all in their turns recommended and brought into u&s;e.</P>
<P>There does not appear any great improve|ment in the applications introduced by the moderns on &s;uch occa&s;ions. As far as I have been able to collect from ob&s;ervation and en|quiry, the treatment of the&s;e ca&s;es for years pa&s;t has been confined to the following or &s;i|milar remedies.</P>
<P>Linen dipped in &s;pirit of wine, applied to the burn and often renewed, is now in fre|quent u&s;e. This was al&s;o advi&s;ed by Syden|ham and other authors; but whatever advan|tage
<PB N="3" REF="7">is to be derived from it, it can only, with propriety, be applied to &s;uperficial burns; &s;hould any ulceration, or even excoriation have taken place, &s;pirituous applications would be more likely to increa&s;e than abate the pain and inflammation.</P>
<P>Some practitioners think it right to bleed, to take away the wrinkled cuticle, and then to apply to the part, ointments compo&s;ed of preparations of lead, and poultices impreg|nated with this mineral.</P>
<P>Some recommend the extract of lead and tincture of opium, mixed with water to be applied immediately, and &s;imple dre&s;&s;ings afterwards.</P>
<P>Or a mixture of vinegar and water, or of fine oatmeal and cold water.</P>
<P>Or &s;pirits of wine and vinegar, in the pro|portion of two ounces of each, mixed with eight ounces of water, and applied <HI>warm.</HI></P>
<P>Another remedy which has been much
<PB N="4" REF="8">commended, con&s;i&s;ts of potato-juice and di&s;|tilled water, to which is added as much com|mon &s;alt as can be di&s;&s;olved in it, with a &s;mall quantity of crude opium.</P>
<P>Grea&s;y applications al&s;o are commonly u&s;ed, &s;uch as olive oil by it&s;elf, or mixed with &s;permaceti ointment, or oil and lime water well &s;haken together.</P>
<P>There are other formulae which might be mentioned; but the&s;e will &s;uffice to &s;hew the common practice, and to prove the di&s;|cordance and uncertainty prevailing in the treatment of burns. In general they appear to be intended to cool, relax, or give ea&s;e, and &s;everal of them an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es in &s;ome mea&s;ure, but they certainly do not fur|ni&s;h effectual means to &s;top the progre&s;s, or le&s;&s;en the powerful action of the matter of fire, in whatever it con&s;i&s;ts, but which pro|bably continues to exi&s;t in the burnt part, and to extend its influence for &s;ome time.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I had been long di&s;|&s;atisfied with all the&s;e methods of treatment, as they &s;eemed of very little efficacy, for not|with&s;tanding their application, I had too of|ten witne&s;&s;ed that the pain was very little abated, that bli&s;ters aro&s;e, and &s;loughs took place in no very inferiour degree to what might have been expected if no means had been employed; the&s;e ob&s;ervations often led me to wi&s;h for a better method than the u&s;ual practice &s;eemed to offer; when, &s;ome years &s;ince, I was &s;ent for to a medical gentleman, who being near a bottle of &s;pirits of wine, which had been imprudently heated to a great degree, by &s;ome accident it took fire, the bottle bur&s;t and its contents flew over his hands, face, and upper part of his neck, all of which were mi&s;erably burnt. At a con&s;ultation on this unfortunate ca&s;e, the u&s;ual modes of treating burns were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="6" REF="10">and from a thorough conviction of the little good to be derived from the applications in common u&s;e, it was agreed that after the lo&s;s of &s;ome blood, cold water alone &s;hould be ap|plied to bathe the parts; and this, being found to give ea&s;e, was continually renewed, and the patient during &s;everal days drank nothing but cold water, and took very little nouri&s;hment. By the&s;e means he was kept in a cool and to|lerably ea&s;y &s;tate, though the pain often re|turned at &s;hort intervals; &s;ome bli&s;ters aro&s;e, which however in little more than a week &s;ub&s;ided and no &s;car was produced.</P>
<P>A misfortune of a &s;imilar nature is related to have happened to the illu&s;trious Boerhaave by the bur&s;ting of Papin's machine or dige&s;t|er, in con&s;equence of which his face and arm were &s;calded by hot water. The whole face was in a little time bli&s;tered and the eyelids &s;o much &s;welled as totally to ob&s;truct his
<PB N="7" REF="11">&s;ight. He immediately ordered him&s;elf to be bled <HI>ad deliquium,</HI> and the next day cau&s;ed the venae&s;ection to be repeated; and afterwards took a pretty &s;trong purgative, although he had been reduced nearly to <HI>a &s;tate of fainting</HI> by the &s;lighter purgatives. He took care to have his face anointed only with unguentum nu|tritum, and covered with empla&s;trum ex la|pide calaminari. After the&s;e profu&s;e evacua|tions the tumour of the parts &s;ub&s;ided and by the u&s;e of a thin diet, and the plentiful drink|ing of cooling liquors, the cure of this dan|gerous &s;cald was &s;o happily advanced in eight or nine days, that he was able to appear again in public, his eyes having e&s;caped from &s;o great a danger; an un&s;ightly &s;car however re|maining in his arm after a <HI>tedious &s;uppuration.</HI></P>
<P>Now it appears to me that in this ca&s;e had more cooling topical applications been u&s;ed, &s;uch plentiful evacuations and &s;uch &s;evere treatment of his con&s;titution would not have
<PB N="8" REF="12">been nece&s;&s;ary. If for in&s;tance &s;ome cool|ing fluid had been applied which would have been &s;oon evaporated, in&s;tead of the burnt and inflamed parts being covered with grea&s;y ointments and pla&s;ters, which ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;top the pores, ob&s;truct per&s;piration and confine the heat, perhaps the accident might have ended &s;till more favorably, and po&s;&s;ibly without any tedious &s;uppuration. We know from experiment that the effects of aqua-fortis when applied to the body are more violent than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from hot water, yet the gentleman before alluded to, by the plan which he pur&s;ued, avoided any &s;uppuration, and even the &s;eparation of the cuticle to any con&s;iderable extent. As I had every rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied with the termination of his ca&s;e, I frequently af|terwards on &s;imilar occa&s;ions u&s;ed cold water, and all applications in as cold a &s;tate as po&s;|&s;ible, notwith&s;tanding the opinion of many re|&s;pectable
<PB N="9" REF="13">authors and practitioners in favour of warmth to be applied to the parts. The good effect of this mode of treatment I expe|rienced on many occa&s;ions, yet &s;omething further &s;eemed wanting; for though this plan well followed up and renewed as often as po&s;|&s;ible, le&s;&s;ened the pain, and abated the heat, it did not quickly &s;ubdue them; and in large and &s;evere burns it &s;eemed di&s;proportioned to the violent effect produced by the fire.</P>
<P>Some years after this, I was &s;ent for to a lady who&s;e neck and face were very much burnt, from her neck-kerchief having taken fire: at a con&s;ultation on her ca&s;e, Sir Walter Farquhar, who was pre&s;ent, propo&s;ed to apply ice to the whole of the burnt parts, although they were very exten&s;ive. As my experience had hitherto been &s;o much in favor of cold ap|plications, my a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;al was mo&s;t readily given, ice was accordingly applied, and appearing to give immediate ea&s;e, was conti|nued
<PB N="10" REF="14">uncea&s;ingly during &s;everal nights and days, after which I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the lady recover without any &s;car re|maining, and without any injury to her health from the cold &s;tate in which &s;he had &s;o long remained.</P>
<P>Not long after this accident, I had occa|&s;ion, in my own family to make trial of this plan. A little boy about three years old, playing with his brothers, was thrown down on the hearth, and to &s;ave him&s;elf caught hold, with one hand, of a hot bar of the grate. Before I &s;aw him, which was in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, the nur&s;e had wrapped his hand in oil. I found him in exqui&s;ite pain, and in&s;tantly &s;ent for ice, with which I covered the hand. The child felt immediate ea&s;e; but as &s;oon as the ice was melted, which was at fir&s;t in a &s;hort time, the pain returned, and he cried out for more. A bli&s;ter aro&s;e, which, by degrees, in one large
<PB N="11" REF="15">bladder, occupied the whole of the palm of the hand, and the in&s;ide of the thumb and fingers, and it increa&s;ed &s;o as to become glo|bular, and nearly of the &s;ize of a hen's egg. The opening or breaking of this was mo&s;t carefully avoided; and ice was con&s;tantly ap|plied to the whole hand, it being immerged, during the day, in a ba&s;on of ice and ice-wa|ter, and at night wrapped in cloths, or co|vered with &s;craped potatoes, &s;oaked in it. Whenever this application was recent, the child was ea&s;y and &s;lept; but at intervals, as the hand grew hot, from the melting of the ice, he became re&s;tle&s;s and cried until it was renewed, when his &s;leep was again compo&s;ed. This plan was continued during a week, at the end of which an ab&s;orption of the extrava&s;ed lymph took place, the cu|ticle which had been elevated, to &s;o great an extent, began to &s;hrink and &s;hrivel; in a few days it became ragged and torn, and was
<PB N="12" REF="16">taken away, without any painful &s;en&s;ation, a perfectly well-healed &s;urface appearing un|derneath.</P>
<P>This method having been thus fortunately pur&s;ued, I have the happine&s;s to &s;ay that my boy enjoys the perfect u&s;e of his hand, and I take this opportunity to expre&s;s my obli|gation to Sir Walter Farquhar for the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of the plan, and for his obliging at|tention on this occa&s;ion. In &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent conver&s;ations which have pa&s;&s;ed between us, it has been mutually regretted that this prac|tice was &s;o little known, which has probably given ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent attempt toward in|troducing it to more general notice.</P>
<P>If I am allowed to judge from the &s;everity and &s;ituation of the burn and from the &s;oft and tender &s;tructure of the parts concerned in the ca&s;e ju&s;t de&s;cribed, and to rea&s;on from what I have &s;een, in many others, I am decidedly of opinion that, had it been treated by any of
<PB N="13" REF="17">the means commonly employed, the inflam|mation would have ri&s;en much higher, and continued much longer; con&s;equently the pain would have been more &s;evere and of longer duration, accompanied with fever. From the greater degree of heat and irritation the bli&s;ter would have continued to increa&s;e, and, if the intentional opening of it which by &s;ome was advi&s;ed, had been avoided, it would have bur&s;t. The admi&s;&s;ion of air would have pro|duced a &s;lough, in which the tendons would have been implicated, in con&s;equence the mu&s;|cles no longer &s;erviceable would have become contracted, and the hand for ever been left maimed and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Some years previous to this accident my own leg was &s;calded with hot oil, on the out|&s;ide, from the knee to the ankle. The be&s;t remedies then in practice were applied, but did not prevent my &s;uffering exce&s;&s;ive pain for many hours, which was followed by the &s;epa|ration
<PB N="14" REF="18">of the cuticle and an ulceration which was not healed for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>Since I have found the advantage ari&s;ing from ice, I have had many opportunities of u&s;ing it on large and exten&s;ive burns, which have &s;erved to confirm me in my good opinion of its beneficial effects, whenever it has been timely and properly applied. In &s;everal ca&s;es it has happened, that either from motives of de|licacy on the part of the patient, or from the at|tention of every one concerned being occupied with the mo&s;t apparent injuries, parts which were burnt have not been di&s;covered in time to receive benefit from the cold application, in con&s;equence of which the cuticle in tho&s;e parts has &s;eparated, &s;loughs have formed, and have been ca&s;t off, leaving &s;ores difficult to be healed; while the parts in their neigh|bourhood more &s;everely burnt, but covered with ice, have e&s;caped without a blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>I could detail many in&s;tances of mi&s;chief
<PB N="15" REF="19">prevented, and cures effected by the&s;e means; but as the progre&s;s of them was in general &s;imilar to the two ca&s;es already. mentioned, it does not appear to be nece&s;&s;ary to add to their te&s;timony.</P>
<P>I &s;hall however take notice of one which occurred very lately.&mdash;A gentleman was much &s;calded by the overturning of a tea-urn. I &s;aw him &s;oon after the accident, and &s;ent to the neare&s;t confectioners for ice, with which the burnt parts were bathed; the heat and pain were &s;oon le&s;&s;ened, and afterwards he felt very little inconvenience.</P>
<P>And I cannot pa&s;s over another unhappy ca&s;e of a poor woman, who, in a fit, fell into the fire. The injury extended over the whole of the neck, back and brea&s;ts, in &s;hort nearly half of the body was &s;corched, and there was one continued burn, which made a &s;urface, by mea&s;urement, of more than four hundred inches. A con&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed after
<PB N="16" REF="20">the accident before &s;he was brought to the ho&s;pital, &s;o that the heat of the fire had had &s;cope enough to do great mi&s;chief; added to this, the inflammatory attack had been ag|gravated by the injudicious application of &s;pi|rits of turpentine, &s;o that her &s;ufferings were extreme. The burnt parts were covered as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible with pounded ice and ice|water, from which &s;he found immediate ea&s;e, and lived three weeks without complaining of much pain, and without that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fever, which u&s;ually accompanies &s;evere burns; after which &s;he &s;unk under the profu&s;ene&s;s of the di&s;|charge from &s;o large a &s;urface, and expired.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e probably the injury was too deeply inflicted at fir&s;t, to allow of a po&s;&s;i|bility of the burnt parts being prevented from &s;loughing off and leaving a &s;ore; for it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed that any means can prevent the effects ari&s;ing from the de&s;truction which the fir&s;t contact of the fire has cau&s;ed. If
<PB N="17" REF="21">that has been &s;ufficiently violent to de&s;troy the living principle of the parts in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, ice being applied may take off the heat, abate inflammation and give ea&s;e, but if the patient lives, the dead parts mu&s;t be thrown off by the living, as happens in all ca&s;es of mortifications from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;evere as this ca&s;e certainly was, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what a more early application of ice might not have effected; but in my opinion, much greater advantage would have been obtained; &s;ince in other in&s;tances, where it has been applied early, and where, though the burn has been both exten&s;ive and deeply inflicted, a &s;top has been put to the heat and inflammation, and &s;loughs have been pre|vented from forming. But con&s;idering this ca&s;e ab&s;tractedly, if ice could act with &s;uch effect as to keep this patient &s;o long alive and ea&s;y, what may not be expected from it in &s;lighter burns?</P>
<PB N="18" REF="22">
<P>From repeated ob&s;ervation of &s;imilar ca&s;es, I am confident that this wretched woman by the common modes of treatment would have continued to &s;uffer great pain, and would have exi&s;ted but a few hours longer.&mdash;Perhaps the prolongation of life in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and under &s;uch circum&s;tances is not greatly to be de&s;ired; but to pre&s;erve it in all ca&s;es, as far as lies in our power, is our duty.&mdash;The re&s;t we leave to Heaven.</P>
<P>It was not my intention, as I have ob|&s;erved, to adduce any more in&s;tances, but &s;ince the preceding pages were printed, I have been favoured with an account of an accident which happened to a young lady, in Cur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on Street. May Fair, written by her&s;elf, and which having permi&s;&s;ion to in&s;ert, I conceive it would not be doing ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject of this e&s;&s;ay if it were omitted; it will therefore be related in her own impre&s;&s;ive words.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="23">
<P>Early in the month of March, 1792, one morning ju&s;t after breakfa&s;t, I went into the parlour, to &s;peak to my mother who was &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide, &s;o that I &s;tood on the hearth with my back to the fire; and as &s;oon as I had communicated what I had to &s;ay to her and my &s;i&s;ter, who was with her, I was going to quit the room, when the latter looking up, perceived that the back of my dre&s;s was on fire. Fright deprived her of all power to act, but my mother immediately endeavoured to ex|tingui&s;h the flames by wrapping her clothes round me, but in vain; the fire was become too &s;trong; and as &s;he concluded the carpet was nailed to the floor, &s;he went out of the room to get &s;omething to throw over me; my fir&s;t impul&s;e was that of following her, when, providentially, I had the pre&s;ence of mind to &s;ee that &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t prove fa|tal;
<PB N="20" REF="24">and throwing my&s;elf down on the car|pet, I rolled over and over, begging my &s;i&s;ter would try and cover me with it, which &s;he could not do, being deprived of &s;trength by her fear; my mother &s;oon returned with a large mat, and the &s;ervants, who had been alarmed by my &s;creams, came in at the &s;ame in&s;tant to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; they threw the mat over me, and them&s;elves upon it, in order to &s;mother the fire; and after &s;ome little time &s;ucceeded; but not before I was &s;everely burnt in two places in the &s;mall of my back; the back of my neck, and the under parts of both arms, ju&s;t above the elbows. I had burnt the fingers of my right hand in at|tempting to untie my mu&s;lin &s;a&s;h. My mo|ther's hands al&s;o &s;uffered; as, on rai&s;ing me from the floor, &s;ome fire &s;till blazed from the back of my handkerchief and cape of my gown, which &s;he &s;troked down from my head and pre&s;&s;ed out with her hands.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="25">
<P>When I had a little recovered from the &s;hock, I &s;ent off directly to reque&s;t the favour of Mr. Farquhar, if at home, to come to me immediately; if not, that he might be in|formed of the accident as &s;oon as he return|ed, and that I was impatient to &s;ee him; three or four hours having elap&s;ed, I &s;ent again to Mr. F. and as he was not come home, one of the gentlemen from his hou&s;e very obligingly came to me; yet I declined availing my&s;elf of his advice, being deter|mined to wait till Mr. Farquhar could come to me, owing to the anxious wi&s;h I had of having his opinion and advice in preference to all others. In the mean time I had applied &s;craped potatoes to my hand, and &s;ome oil to the re&s;t of the burns. About ten o'clock in the evening Mr. Farquhar arrived; and after he had &s;een the places which were burnt, he ordered &s;ome ice to be &s;ent for in&s;tantly, and that I &s;hould have &s;omebody &s;it up with me
<PB N="22" REF="26">all night, who was to keep con&s;tantly apply|ing to the burns cloths dipped in the ice, and to be changed as &s;oon as the chill went off; that if I became weary, and could &s;leep, they &s;hould get &s;ome fre&s;h hogs-lard, and fir&s;t wa&s;h it extremely well with water; after which it was to be beat up with ice &s;pread on linen, and laid on the burns: but as &s;oon as I waked, to u&s;e the ice &s;imply as before. When Mr. F. left me, I had my bed immediately laid on the floor, as being more ea&s;y and con|venient to tho&s;e who attended me, and &s;trictly followed Mr. Farquhar's directions the whole night. On fir&s;t applying the ice, it made me &s;hudder for a minute or two; but the pain I felt was &s;oon abated, and in the cour&s;e of the night I got a little &s;leep. At noon, next day, when Mr. Farquhar came, he found me in a fair way of doing well, and only re|que&s;ted I would per&s;evere in applying the ice frequently, and in the intervals keep the
<PB N="23" REF="27">hogs-lard and ice to the burns. I &s;oon expe|rienced the benefit of this method of treat|ment, for in a few days the fire was entirely drawn out, and though all the bli&s;ters had broke, not one of them had the lea&s;t tendency to become a &s;ore. Con&s;idering how much I was burnt, the pain I &s;uffered was comparative|ly trifling; which I am per&s;uaded, was entire|ly owing to the application of the ice: and my mother, who al&s;o u&s;ed the ice to her hands, was cured in a few days. In the cour&s;e of a month or five weeks, I perfectly recovered; and have never &s;ince &s;uffered the &s;malle&s;t in|convenience from that accident; nor did I at the time catch any cold, though I &s;at up for the mo&s;t part of the fir&s;t night, with &s;carce any cloathing, and as the ice di&s;&s;olved, of cour&s;e I was very wet, and although I had before this accident, been for more than two years greatly indi&s;po&s;ed by nervous com|plaints, I had not any fit, or tho&s;e nervous
<PB N="24" REF="28">&s;ymptons which my friends were apprehen|&s;ive would have been the ca&s;e after the ter|ror and fright I &s;uffered by the accident.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable time appears to have elap|&s;ed in this lady's ca&s;e before the ice was re|&s;orted to, notwith&s;tanding which it &s;eems to have acted with great power and efficacy. On the whole I cannot too &s;trongly recommend the u&s;e of this remedy in burns of every de|&s;cription, as I pre&s;ume we may fairly conclude from what has been premi&s;ed that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great capability of giving ea&s;e, and preventing the deplorable ravages and mi&s;chief which &s;uffering the heat to remain in the part pro|duces, for from every ob&s;ervation I have made, the fire does not produce all its effects on the fir&s;t attack, or immediate contact with the part; but afterwards lies rankling in
<PB N="25" REF="29">it, and continues to &s;pread its de&s;tructive in|fluence until its fury is &s;pent, or its power counteracted: as is evident from the continu|ance and even encrea&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive pain and inflammation.</P>
<P>Whether modern philo&s;ophers will allow that fire applied to any part of the human body does remain united to it for a time, I am not certain; but &s;uch appears to me to be the fact, and this opinion has, I find, been main|tained by &s;everal very re&s;pectable authors.</P>
<P>Hildanus mentions it as his opinion, and &s;eems to lay great &s;tre&s;s, as indeed mo&s;t of the old writers did, on the frequent change of the dre&s;&s;ings in burns. In a ca&s;e which he de&s;cribes, he &s;ays, that he renewed the pla&s;ters four times every hour, for the fir&s;t day, and by tho&s;e means drew out the greate&s;t part of the fire.</P>
<P>Fernelius a&s;&s;erts that fire it&s;elf applied near, is its own antidote to drive out the fire of the burnt part, and by which pain is aba|ted.
<PB N="26" REF="30">He adds that &s;ome remedies applied to the parts entice out the fire.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e Parey al&s;o &s;ays, if we carry the burnt part near to a candle, or live coal, and hold it there long enough, the fire will at|tract the igneous particles which have been imbibed, and which are the cau&s;e of the pain. This, though a painful proce&s;s, will, I believe, be generally allowed to be efficacious, as it certainly does after a time cool the part and give ea&s;e. May not this effect be cau&s;ed by the attraction which takes place between &s;imilar particles, and from the ab&s;orption of a &s;maller body of fire into the larger ma&s;s? Or may it not happen from the air &s;urround|ing the burn being rarified and deprived of its oxygen by the pre&s;ence, of the larger body of fire, &s;o as to become le&s;s capable of afford|ing pabulum to the heat in the burnt part, and which is thus gradually extingui&s;hed? Or does it ari&s;e from the &s;ame principle, what|ever
<PB N="27" REF="31">that may be, by which the rays of the &s;un thrown on a fire extingui&s;h it?</P>
<P>However, in whatever way it is account|ed for, if it be admitted that, by any means, we can immediately abate pain by le&s;&s;ening heat in a burnt part, it &s;urely proves that it did there &s;uperfluou&s;ly exi&s;t; and as there is perhaps but one &s;pecies of heat throughout all nature, which, whether evident to the &s;ight or only &s;en|&s;ible to the touch, whether it gives life to the blood and vegetation to plants, or fu&s;es me|tals, and decompo&s;es combu&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, is &s;till only a different modification of the &s;ame element, it may be ea&s;ily conceived that a much greater quantity of its particles may be added to a living part, to which fire it|&s;elf has been applied, than can po&s;&s;ibly be produced by the powers of animal life; and with regard to the retention of it, the tem|porary continuance of &s;uperabundant heat in every &s;pecies of matter is &s;elf-evident. If then
<PB N="28" REF="32">dead animal parts are capable of retaining it for a time, is it not likely to be longer pre|&s;erved in living parts, who&s;e powers of per|petually keeping up a con&s;iderable degree of heat under every variety of climate are &s;o univer&s;al? In &s;ome mea&s;ure to prove that this is the fact, it may be ob&s;erved, that if any &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance as &s;craped potatoes be ap|plied to a burnt part of the body, it will very &s;oon become heated, and to &s;uch a degree, as to emit &s;moke; and if the &s;ame be made to co|ver an inflammation on the &s;urface of the body, from an internal cau&s;e, it will certainly grow hot, but in a very inferior degree: which &s;urely &s;hews, that heat in a part ari&s;ing from a burn, is &s;omething more than mere inflammation.</P>
<P>But whether the theory be doubted or not it mu&s;t be univer&s;ally allowed, that the mo&s;t rational and be&s;t practice will be to oppo&s;e the action of fire as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by every means in our power. And to ef|fect
<PB N="29" REF="33">this purpo&s;e, I mu&s;t again ob&s;erve that I think my&s;elf well warranted in main|taining ice to be &s;uper-eminently u&s;eful The mode of its action on a burn may po&s;&s;i|bly be accounted for on the &s;ame grounds at the pa&s;&s;age of the electric fluid, by the doc|trine of plus and minus, ice being a &s;ub&s;tance which has acquired &s;olidity by the depriva|tion of heat, readily ab&s;orbs it from warmer bodies till they become of the &s;ame degree of temperature. Ice applied to a hand in a na|tural healthy &s;tate, gives pain, and why? be|cau&s;e it deprives it of its due, inherent, vital heat; on the &s;ame principle if a part &s;uffers pain by being overcharged with heat from having been expo&s;ed to the application of fire, ice will give ea&s;e, by ab&s;orbing the &s;u|per-abundant heat which had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>It follows then that the &s;ooner it is applied after the accident has happened the better, as
<PB N="30" REF="34">the fire will have le&s;s time to do mi&s;chief, if the application be deferred till bli&s;ters are formed, and &s;loughs produced, a great degree of ea&s;e may be obtained, but the de&s;truction of parts which has already taken place, can|not entirely be prevented from going through its u&s;ual cour&s;e of &s;loughs and &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>In London this remedy may be readily procured, indeed it is now &s;o common an ar|ticle of luxury, that in mo&s;t large towns, and often at gentlemens country &s;eats, it is to be had at all &s;ea&s;ons. If however it &s;hould at any time be wanting, the colde&s;t water, or any other good conductor of heat may be &s;ub&s;tituted. The method of freezing water by the &s;olution of neutral &s;alts may in ca&s;es of urgency be well adapted to our purpo&s;e; and as this can be performed with materials to be procured in almo&s;t every neighbourhood, we have happily this valuable application &s;el|dom out of our reach.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="35">
<P>Equal parts of &s;al ammoniac and &s;alt-pe|tre finely powdered and mixed together, in the proportion of three ounces of each put into four ounces of water, produce a &s;olution which &s;inks the thermometer thirty &s;ix degrees, and as it is ea&s;y even in &s;ummer to procure water as cool as fifty degrees, a &s;ufficient degree of cold may be obtained at once to freeze water in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el immer&s;ed it it.</P>
<P>Even a &s;aturated &s;olution of common &s;alt in water, will con&s;iderably increa&s;e the cold of water immer&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>Cold fluids may be u&s;ed either by plung|ing the burnt parts into them, if the limbs have received the injury, or by &s;craped potatoes, or linen moi&s;tened with them, or by other means, and the plan &s;hould not be di&s;conti|nued &s;o long as heat and pain remain, the idea being con&s;tantly kept in view, that the effect of heat in the&s;e ca&s;es is be&s;t counteracted by cold.</P>
<P>There is certainly &s;omething alarming
<PB N="32" REF="36">and very repugnant to our feelings, in the ap|plication of &s;o cold a &s;ub&s;tance as ice to a large &s;urface of the body, particularly of per&s;ons of a weak and delicate con&s;titution; and it can|not be wondered at if the friends of the party, and al&s;o medical men &s;hould at fir&s;t object to it, as likely to give cold, cau&s;e rheumati&s;m, or do perhaps as much harm, as the burn it|&s;elf might have occa&s;ioned; but from repeat|ed experience, I can affirm that it may be u&s;ed with &s;afety; indeed it appears that the &s;ame effect does not follow the application of cold to the body in this &s;ituation, as would infallibly happen at any other time; which may, I think, be accounted for from the body being in a &s;tate of heat and irritation, and therefore capable of re&s;i&s;ting the effect of cold more than at another time, or in other words, from the additional heat counteracting the cold, and preventing its u&s;ual effect on the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="37">
<P>Ever &s;ince I have been convinced of the powerful effect of ice in the&s;e ca&s;es, I have endeavoured by practice and conver&s;ation to inculcate the u&s;e of it. If by thus making it more publicly known I &s;hall at all contri|bute to re&s;train the ravages cau&s;ed by fire ap|plied to the human body, or prevent the de|formity which is the u&s;ual con&s;equence of &s;e|vere burns, my feelings will be abundantly gratified.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the deformity which is often cau&s;ed by burns, I &s;hall take the op|portunity of adding a few words on that &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>The cicatrix which takes place on the healing of a wound, after the de&s;truction of the &s;kin and cellular membrane by fire, ge|nerally makes a very un&s;eemly appearance,
<PB N="34" REF="38">even where it is &s;uperficial, owing princi|pally to the contraction of the circumference toward the center, and the lo&s;s of the true &s;kin which is never perfectly re&s;tored. But when unnatural adhe&s;ions take place between parts which &s;hould be &s;eparate, it becomes an object of infinitely greater importance, as be&s;ides the &s;hocking fight which &s;uch in|&s;tances exhibit, the u&s;e of the parts concerned, if not wholly de&s;troyed, will be, more or le&s;s according to circum&s;tances, re&s;tricted and di|mini&s;hed. Every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved melancholy in&s;tances of this nature, and pro|fe&s;&s;ionally I have been obliged to &s;ee many; in &s;ome the head drawn down &s;ideways has been fixed to the &s;houlder, in others the fore arm bent has adhered to the upper arm: the leg I have &s;een contracted and firmly in con|tact with the thigh. Such and &s;imilar ca&s;es are not infrequently brought to St. Bartholo|mew's Ho&s;pital, in hopes that the parts may
<PB N="35" REF="39">be re&s;tored to their natural functions; but in general, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;urgery can af|ford in the&s;e ca&s;es is by no means adequace to the expectation or wi&s;hes of the unfortunate &s;ufferers, for although the mo&s;t prominent part of the contraction, and that which ap|pears to be the main cau&s;e or hindrance to the replacement of the parts in their natural &s;i|tuation be divided, &s;uch is the rigidity pro|duced in all the neighbouring parts, from the lo&s;s of the cellular membrane, and from that degree of cri&s;pation which is cau&s;ed by the fire in all the &s;urrounding mu&s;cles, membranes, and ligaments, that after the divi&s;ion of the principal cord, as it may be called, is perform|ed, the parts contiguous will not recede or give way; and when joints are included in the burn they too often remain completely locked, or retain a very confined motion. But although a complete cure cannot be promi&s;ed, the&s;e mi&s;erable ca&s;es are not to be abandoned with|out
<PB N="36" REF="40">attempting &s;ome means for their relief, as they may &s;ometimes receive advantages be|yond what could be expected.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een a boy about &s;ix years old, who nine months before had been mo&s;t dread|fully burnt in the neck and face, the cicatrix had drawn the under lip down toward the lower part of the neck, over which the &s;aliva was con&s;tantly flowing, the under jaw was connected by a tight rigid cord to the brea&s;t; on the whole, as may be ea&s;ily conceived, the child was a mo&s;t pitiable and frightful object.</P>
<P>Although con&s;iderable benefit was not ex|pected to be derived from any operation in this ca&s;e, it was in it&s;elf &s;o deplorable, that it was determined to give it the chance of what might ari&s;e from the divi&s;ion of that part of the cord, which appeared to be the prominent or principal cau&s;e of detaining the chin in &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a &s;ituation, more e&s;pe|cially as it appeared to be formed in a great
<PB REF="41">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="37" REF="42">degree of hardened &s;kin which with perfect &s;afety might be divided. On the divi&s;ion I found as I had &s;u&s;pected, that it was compo|&s;ed of a rigid ma&s;s which gave but little way, while all the parts contiguous retained an un|alterably fixed contraction, and no great ad|vantage appeared likely to be gained from the operation; however, the edges of the wound being kept apart as much as po&s;&s;ible during the healing of it, I had the plea&s;ure to find, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ticking pla&s;ter and bandage we were enabled to rai&s;e the chin, and bring the lip much nearer to the mouth; and thus, with con&s;tant attention, the appearance which &s;uch a di&s;tortion of &s;o principal a feature had occa&s;ioned is con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened, the &s;a|liva and food no longer e&s;cape from the mouth and the &s;peech is rendered articulate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e was &s;o remarkable that I have been induced to in&s;ert two &s;ketches, one drawn before the operation, the other to repre&s;ent its pre&s;ent &s;tate, by an ingenious &s;tudent in &s;urgery.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="38" REF="43">
<P>But though the chirurgical art is much re|&s;tricted in its powers of remedying the&s;e dread|ful con&s;equences of fire, it can do a great deal by way of preventing them from taking place. This however will depend not only on the &s;kill and management of the &s;urgeon, but of|ten on the attention of nur&s;es, and in many ca&s;es the re&s;olution and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the pa|tients them&s;elves mu&s;t be called in aid.</P>
<P>If the effect of the fire has been &s;o violent as to cau&s;e the &s;kin and cellular membrane and perhaps the fa&s;cia, or even the parts &s;till deeper to &s;eparate from the living, at the time when the &s;loughs are ca&s;ting off and during the healing of the wounds, great care &s;hould be taken to keep the parts a&s;under by every means in our power; if for in&s;tance the fin|gers are burnt, they &s;hould be carefully kept apart by dre&s;&s;ings and bandages, otherwi&s;e they will adhere together and become one ma&s;s as I have often &s;een. When the parts
<PB N="39" REF="44">&s;urrounding joints are burnt, the patient, if let alone and tru&s;ted to his own judgment and di&s;cretion, in order to obtain a little ea&s;e will generally place the &s;uffering limb in a &s;tate of flexion; but this &s;hould be oppo&s;ed as much as can prudently and properly be done, and the patient al&s;o &s;hould be warned of the ill con&s;equences ari&s;ing from &s;uch po&s;ition, and be per&s;uaded to lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward placing and maintaining the limb in a proper &s;ituation; for if the joint mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be locked, as frequently in &s;pite of all our endea|vours will be the ca&s;e, the parts connected with the joint will be more u&s;eful in an ex|tended than in a contracted &s;tate. But though this will apply to joints in general, as the neck, knee, or ancle, the lower-arm is an ex|ception; for if the parts &s;urrounding the joint of the elbow be &s;o burnt that all hopes of pre|&s;erving its motion are given over, and con&s;e|quently there is no expectation when the
<PB N="40" REF="45">wounds are healed, but that it mu&s;t remain locked, it will be a more u&s;eful member in a bent po&s;ition than in a &s;trait one. The fin|gers al&s;o will be mo&s;t properly left in in a &s;tate of &s;emiflexion.</P>
<P>What has been ob&s;erved with regard to the burns of the arm will apply to fractures in the elbow joint, in which it &s;ometimes hap|pens that a portion of one of the condyles of the humerus, or the head of the radius is broken off and forced into the joint, or placed in &s;uch a po&s;ition as to cau&s;e an anchylo&s;is. In all the&s;e ca&s;es when it can be brought a|bout, the arm &s;hould be placed in a bent po|&s;ition: if then a &s;tiff joint be the con&s;equence, the hand can a&s;&s;i&s;t in admini&s;tering food, and be u&s;eful for mo&s;t of the ordinary purpo&s;es of life. The&s;e circum&s;tances may appear too
<PB N="41" REF="46">obvious to require to be noticed; but the plain|e&s;t facts do not always occur mo&s;t readily to the recollection. And this is a ca&s;e which re|quires immediate deci&s;ion; for if the limb be not laid properly very early, before ten&s;ion and inflammation take place, it &s;oon becomes out of our power to alter it. I have more than once &s;een an arm laid and kept &s;trait with a fracture in the joint of the elbow, in con&s;e|quence of which an anchylo&s;is was formed, and the limb became irrecoverably u&s;ele&s;s: I have therefore thought the caution not un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>However &s;evere and irremediable the effect of fire on the joints may be, in many in&s;tances, after the fir&s;t and mo&s;t violent inflammation is a little &s;ub&s;ided, &s;ome degree of motion may be given, at lea&s;t an attempt from time
<PB N="42" REF="47">to time &s;hould be made, and continued if po&s;|&s;ible during the progre&s;s of &s;uppuration and cicatrization.</P>
<P>Parey and Hildanus advi&s;e opening the bli&s;ters ari&s;ing from burns, and &s;ome modern &s;urgeons recommend this practice, but I am clearly of opinion that the cuticle &s;hould not be removed &s;o long as it will remain to cover the part and defend it from the air. Every one knows how extremely painful it is to have any part of the body touched from whence the cuticle is abraded; if the bli&s;ters are let alone, the extrava&s;ed lymph will often be ab&s;orbed and di&s;&s;ipated, and when the &s;ubjacent &s;kin is covered with a new cuticle, that which was elevated into bli&s;ters &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;eparates of it&s;elf without any pain. Soft ointments, fomentations and poultices may be occa&s;ion|ally applied, but great attention &s;hould be paid to repre&s;s and keep down the granulations, which in the healing of wounds after burns,
<PB N="43" REF="48">are particularly apt to be luxuriant, and to cau&s;e an uneven, un&s;ightly cicatrix.</P>
<P>That mi&s;erably maimed and deformed ob|jects ari&s;ing from burns, often happen through neglect, I am ready to admit; but am far from concluding that the &s;urgeon is always to blame: I know the peculiar difficulties which attend the&s;e ca&s;es, where, be&s;ides the di&s;po&s;i|tion which after lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance by burns, the parts &s;urrounding have to contract, the natural inclination which patients feel to obtain ea&s;e, by putting the parts in a wrong &s;ituation, will often counteract the be&s;t inten|tions; and in infants, added to the cries and re&s;i&s;tance of the child, the mi&s;placed tender|ne&s;s of parents and nur&s;es is &s;ometimes to be encountered. But in &s;pite of every ob&s;tacle, it &s;hould never be &s;uffered to e&s;cape the memory, that if ulcerations ari&s;ing from burns, are not watched with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and daily attention, contractions and unnatural adhe&s;ions
<PB N="44" REF="49">will often take place, which will remain to the end of life; but which, by artificial and &s;kilful management, may be very frequently prevented. However, I &s;hall conclude with repeating what I firmly believe to be true, that the&s;e dreadful ca&s;es would happen much le&s;s frequently, or might often be totally and ab|&s;olutely prevented by the timely application of ice.</P>
