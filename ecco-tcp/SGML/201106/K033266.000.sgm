<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is wrote for the benefit of per&s;ons afflicted with the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, in its various &s;tages; for the regulation of their diet and conduct on any emergency that may happen, when it is not in their power to ap|ply immediately to their Surgeon; and al&s;o proper in&s;tructions for con|ducting them&s;elves while under cure; I have therefore not given any ana|tomy
<PB N="iv" REF="3">of the parts, nor entered into the minutiae of the di&s;ea&s;e, more than is nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;toring the con&s;titu|tion, and given means for future pre|vention. Such a &s;mall work as this will appear peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to every one. In the fir&s;t place, from the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, prudent per&s;ons will be on their guard, and libertines have a method to prevent any future injury; by which means po&s;terity will be benefited, and un|happy &s;ufferers will here have full directions; which will not only be acceptable to them, but to all per&s;ons of either &s;ex.</P>

<P>THE Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ancient records, 1376 and 1398 public &s;tews and brothels were tolerated under certain regulations; and tho&s;e girls that had the Burning, as it was called, were &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and forbid to lie with man while &s;he had it.

<P>Having thus far given the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, from the beginning to the end, that every one may know how to avoid tho&s;e who are unfortu|nate enough to have any of the above appearances, I &s;hall now proceed to give advice to tho&s;e who labour under its baneful influence.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, let me injoin you to temperance, &s;oberne&s;s, and cha&s;tity; three moral virtues here indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Your diet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neither purging nor a low diet are nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of the gonorrhoea; dra&s;tic purging will in|crea&s;e the inflammation.</NOTE> mu&s;t be moderate, and roa&s;t meat is preferable to boiled; beef and mutton, to veal or lamb; the former is the more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; but mutton is the ea&s;ie&s;t of all. Avoid &s;pices, or high &s;auces; for, as it is in its fir&s;t &s;tage a topical inflammation, every thing which increa&s;es the cir|culation of the blood will promote the di&s;ea&s;e; con&s;equently all exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;es mu&s;t be avoid|ed,
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;uch as riding on hor&s;e-back, leaping, jump|ing, &amp;c. You may drink wine; but beware of intoxication, or you will &s;uffer the next day &s;e|verely. Though at this time Venus attracts your thoughts, yet pay no homage at her &s;hrine. In &s;hort, eat when you are hungry, but &s;mall quan|tities at a time; let your drink be moderate, and be &s;atisfied when your thir&s;t is quenched. The pa&s;&s;ions of the mind have here great influence; avoid them; they irritate the di&s;ea&s;e; and when indulged to exce&s;s, they have been known to bring on alarming &s;ymptoms. I mu&s;t lay particular &s;tre&s;s on cleanline&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;pecies of lues venerea prevails in the we&s;t of Scotland, which the natives call Sibbins, or Sivvins, owing to uncleanline&s;s.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially in the fair &s;ex; for without this the di&s;ea&s;e rapidly increa&s;es, from the corroding virus lying on the parts, or hid in the folds, by which means the irritation is in|crea&s;ed, and con&s;equently the inflammation will extend, bringing on chancres, buboes, &amp;c. which
<PB N="17" REF="16">in many in&s;tances, by timely care, might have been avoided: and to this end always wa&s;h the parts with a little milk and water two or three times a day; or, what is better, a &s;cruple of calomel in two or three ounces of ro&s;e water; and between the folds put a little lint, which change every time. To tho&s;e who in the fir&s;t &s;tage u&s;e injections, retain them in the parts as long as po&s;&s;ible; to let it come away immediately is of very little &s;ervice. By the improper u&s;e of a&s;tringent injections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A&s;tringent injections are &s;uch as the vitriol, alum, and the preparations of lead. About 10 or 15 drops of the extract of lead, in four ounces of &s;oft water, are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to wa&s;h the parts when a pariphi|mo&s;is takes place; it acts as a &s;editive, and will abate the inflammation; but ought to be &s;paringly u&s;ed.</NOTE> the running at fir&s;t is frequently &s;topped, and the un|happy &s;ufferer thinks he is cured, till, alas! appear|ances too &s;oon inform him of his fatal mi&s;take. On the contrary, injections that are &s;erviceable at fir&s;t increa&s;e the di&s;charge; your body &s;hould be
<PB N="18" REF="17">kept moderate, neither bound nor loo&s;e. If you find a painful &s;en&s;ation in your groin, or te&s;ticle, and at this time it is not convenient to apply for advice, &s;u&s;pend the te&s;ticle in a bag, and rub it with a little mercurial ointment mixt with cam|phor; the &s;ame by the buboe; but remember, in the latter, rub rather below the part, that the lym|phatis may carry it through the glands; but if they &s;till increa&s;e, apply a poultice of bread and milk, mixt with the blue mercurial ointment, which, in general, will carry them off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There certainly is no occa&s;ion to bring the buboe to &s;uppuration, giving the patient unnece&s;&s;ary pain and trouble; I do, and always think it advi&s;able to &s;up|pre&s;s them, e&s;pecially at the beginning, as they fre|quently ari&s;e from irritation, which cau&s;es inflamma|tion in the glands, and hence ob&s;tructions. I mu&s;t here a&s;k the gentlemen of the faculty, if abating the inflammation, le&s;&s;ening the irritation, and by any means removing the ob&s;tructions, can pox the patient? On the contrary, I think letting it proceed to &s;uppura|tion, and expo&s;ing a &s;urface to the air, is the mo&s;t like|ly means in the world. [I knew a worthy practitioner in the country &s;o bigotted to the idea of a &s;uppurated buboe curing the di&s;eafe, that after he has applied his cau&s;tic, he &s;eldom took any further notice of it.] But if the patient applies too late, and &s;uppuration is at its height, I &s;eldom open them in men&mdash;in women, never. If an opening is required, I guage the lancet between my finger and thumb, and by drawing the &s;ame acro&s;s the buboe, from left to right (and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> as occa&s;ion may require) open it with ea&s;e and &s;afety; by this means the patient is not frightened with the knife, nor tortured with the cau&s;tic. The dre&s;&s;ing cannot be too &s;light; and for the fir&s;t day or two apply a poultice of white bread and milk mixt, with a little mercurial ointment over all; this takes off the callous edges, &s;o much complained of when the knife is u&s;ed.</NOTE>, or relieve
<PB N="19" REF="18">till you can get a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buboes &s;ometimes, by ill treatment, or a bad ha|bit of body, become phagedenic, i. e. when the lips of the wound are hard, loo&s;e, and for the &s;pace of an inch does not adhere to the &s;urface of the ulcer; under|neath this a probe may be pa&s;&s;ed; all round there is a livid appearance, di&s;charges a thin fluid very different from the true pus. Some practitioners have been in|duced to give mercury at this time, while &s;uppuration is going on, and likewi&s;e after matter has been evacu|ated, which will irritate, inflame, and produce a truly phagedenic &s;ore; when this is the ca&s;e, I would recom|mend the bark and &s;ar&s;aparilla; the patient at the &s;ame time &s;hould have a milk and vegetable diet, with coun|try air. There is no medicine that &s;o &s;peedily re|moves the effects of mercury, as &s;ar&s;aparilla given in powder or decoction, and bark will &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;|tem. After this treatment has been u&s;ed for &s;ome time, and the &s;ore brought into a good &s;tate, it will be apt to &s;pread, and break out again, from being af|fected by the venereal matter returning, when mercu|ry mu&s;t be had recour&s;e to, but with a great deal of caution. If the &s;ore &s;hould again have phagedenic appearances, mercury mu&s;t be de&s;i&s;ted from, and the bark and &s;ar&s;aparilla as before; and when at a favour|able &s;tate, the mercury again continued. The&s;e kind of ulcers are the mo&s;t difficult to cure in all &s;urgery; outward applications &s;hould be mild; the be&s;t is a white bread poultice.</NOTE>. If a phimo&s;is comes on, &s;oak the part in milk and water, &s;yringe the
<PB N="20" REF="19">glands with the calomel injection frequently, after which put up a little lint round the nut with a probe,
<PB N="21" REF="20">or &s;kewer. The pariphimo&s;is treat the &s;ame; but always have your &s;urgeon's advice, e&s;pecially in the latter, as delays here would be injurious. I would always advi&s;e, as long as any &s;calding con|tinues, to drink plentifully of lin&s;eed tea, or to eat gum arabic; the&s;e mucilaginous &s;ub&s;tances will abate the acrimony of the urine. If any hard knot &s;hould ari&s;e, rub them with the ointment before-mentioned. Another &s;ymptom attending this &s;tage, is a chordee; no plea&s;ant companion; but it is &s;oon removed, by rubbing the part with a little ointment, and applying a pla&s;ter of the &s;ame upon it.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<P>Having thus far given you cautions, I will now proceed to a more plea&s;ant &s;ubject, namely, &s;ymp|toms of an approaching cure; which is, when the &s;calding abates, the di&s;charge thickens, the green appearance gradually vani&s;hes, yellow &s;uc|ceeds, till at la&s;t it is white, and does not &s;tain the linen, and may now be called a common gleet, which is removed by bal&s;amic medicines, fre&s;h air, and moderate exerci&s;e; to which I will add, frequent topical cold bathing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The parts are always, after a gonorrhoea, relaxed, or lame; and nothing is more conducive to re&s;tore the tone of the fibres than topical cold bathing: what I mean by this is, to pour a bottle of cold water on the parts as &s;oon as you ri&s;e in the morning; this &s;ome call cabbaging.</NOTE> If from ill treat|ment, or neglect, the urethra is filled with carno|&s;ities, or callofities, &s;o as to ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of urine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Where there are &s;trictures in the urethra, the urine is always divided into two &s;treams; and there is always matter on the bougie where the &s;tricture or ulcer is. A bougie will &s;ometimes cau&s;e a chordee in an healthy per&s;on; but, as above, it is the mo&s;t painful at the part affected.</NOTE>, then bougies become ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary;
<PB N="23" REF="22">but always be careful to tie a piece of thread round the top, bind and fa&s;ten it gently around the nut.</P>
<P>Though thus far I have treated it as a &s;imple inflammation, and &s;uppo&s;ed it to be cured on that principle; yet always take &s;ome alterative medi|cine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mercurials, in &s;mall do&s;es, are the be&s;t alterative medicines; and during their cour&s;e I always give the following diet drink&mdash;Take of &s;a&s;&s;afras chips 4 oz. &s;ar&s;aparilla 2 oz. guaiacum &s;havings 3 oz. mezerian root 2 drams; pour on this three quarts of boiling water, and when cold, it is fit for u&s;e; a gill four or five times a day.</NOTE>, to guard again&s;t any lurking mi&s;chief; for I am certain too great &s;ecurity here, or rely|ing

I am certain it is from this our ho&s;|pitals are &s;o crouded&mdash;from this lurking mi&s;chief breaking at a di&s;tant period in various forms, well de|&s;erving the name of Hydra.</NOTE>, has, in the end, been the ruin of many; for the di&s;ea&s;e lying dormant for a number of years, has after|wards broke out in the various forms above-men-mentioned, which, had they taken &s;ome alterative medicines, would never have happened. Where this is the ca&s;e, alterative medicines are the &s;peedi|e&s;t and &s;afe&s;t cure; they act without injuring the &s;y&s;tem, and, joined with cleanline&s;s, never fail in the mo&s;t confirmed pox. The fir&s;t thing to be thought of is frequently cleaning the teeth, and
<PB N="25" REF="24">gargling the throat, change of linen, frequently wa&s;hing the body, and beware of catching cold. If any &s;caley eruptions appear, wa&s;h them with bran and water; or warts, clip them off with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and apply the ointment over them. If your throat, or no&s;trils are affected, u&s;e the fumes of mercury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The be&s;t method of applying mercury in fumes, is to put ten or fifteen grains of cinnabar on a hot iron, drawing the &s;moak into the throat, or up the no&s;e, twice a day, through a funnel.</NOTE>, or apply immediately to your &s;ur|geon. If nodes ari&s;e, rub them every night with the ointment; keep the body temperate; and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, it is advi&s;able to wear a flannel jer|kin and drawers next the &s;kin. When you find all the &s;ymptoms abate and vani&s;h, leave not off your medicines too &s;uddenly. After which I would advi&s;e a cour&s;e of bark, exerci&s;e, change of air, and cold bathing, to take off the irritability the di&s;ea&s;e has cau&s;ed in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>Before this advice is clo&s;ed, I &s;hall give a few hints on the u&s;e of mercury.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I do not agree with &s;alva|tion, even in the wor&s;t of ca&s;es. It is from this imprudence that this &s;acred medicine has been thrown a&s;ide; a medicine which, when admini|&s;tered with caution, is not injurious to the human frame; on the contrary, expel it from the Mate|ria Medica, how many millions would &s;uffer from the &s;curvy, gout, rheumati&s;m, yaws, bilious com|plaints, &amp;c.? It &s;hould be given in &s;mall do&s;es, with|out any perceptible action. In this manner, what are its effects? it increa&s;es the action of the lympha|tic &s;y&s;tem; the con&s;equence is, the glands, before ob&s;tructed, have now a free circulation, the offend|ing virus is ab&s;orbed, and thrown off by the pores of the &s;kin, urine, &s;tool, &amp;c. the blood is purified, and the body now re&s;tored to health. On the contrary, if too large a quantity is taken, a foul breath, rotten gums, carious teeth, &amp;c. en&s;ues;
<PB N="27" REF="26">the glands are irritated to &s;ecretions beyond their power, the appetite is lo&s;t, the inte&s;tinal canal af|fected, the head &s;wells, the tongue hangs out of the mouth, and &s;aliva is continually running from it; copious &s;weats, and univer&s;al debility follow; at this period few come near him, from the offen|&s;ive &s;mell. Suppo&s;e he &s;tops here, and the di&s;ea&s;e is cured, how dearly is it paid for, when &s;o &s;afe a remedy is at hand? He lingers out the re&s;t of his life with a debilitated, irritable con&s;titution.&mdash; How many by this are brought to an early grave! From this cau&s;e &s;alivation is now ju&s;tly exploded.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole, I would advi&s;e, that in the fir&s;t &s;tage of a gonorrhoea, or clap, the method of cure &s;hall be to le&s;&s;en the inflammation and ir|ritability of the &s;y&s;tem, to promote gentle per&s;pi|ration, to correct the acrimony of the fluids, and to protect the body from infection. Injections that will abate the inflammation, that are void of a&s;tringency, are preferable; they are applied to the
<PB N="28" REF="27">part di&s;ea&s;ed, and certainly will cure more &s;peedily than medicines taken by the mouth. With pro|per injections, where they have applied as &s;oon as they have di&s;covered the injury, I have complete|ly cured, in a few days, the mo&s;t virulent gonor|rhoea. What medicines are taken internally &s;hould be anti-inflammatory. After this, when the &s;calding is abated, the colour gone, a &s;imple gleet only remaining, bal&s;amics are the mo&s;t pro|per; but, after all, it is prudent to guard the con|&s;titution by a few alterative medicines. In the lues venerea alteratives are what we mu&s;t depend on; but when joined to bal&s;amics, and others that will promote a gentle per&s;piration, they are &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. By the&s;e principles I have always &s;ucceeded in the wor&s;t of ca&s;es; and weak debilitated habits, ari&s;ing from exce&s;&s;es of any kind what&s;oever, by cordial tonic medicines, cold bathing, change of air, and exerci&s;e, are &s;ure to meet with relief.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
<P>I mu&s;t here guard youth from that diabolical practice of machinery; &s;o far is it from being a pre&s;ervative, that numbers have been poxed from too great a &s;ecurity. There is now another fa&s;hionable vice, no le&s;s injurious in debilitating the &s;y&s;tem, by forcing nature further than her &s;trength will bear, and bringing on a train of ner|vous complaints; I mean, whipping. I cannot help wi&s;hing, with Dr. Faulk, that fools who la&s;civiou&s;ly u&s;e this exerci&s;e to &s;tir up their lu&s;t, might be &s;witched after emi&s;&s;ion, as they endured it before; which would &s;oon cure them of this diabolical practice.</P>
<P>To conclude; I &s;hall now lay down the mo&s;t &s;afe means of preventing this loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e. After intercour&s;e with a &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, always wa&s;h the parts with a little warm water, or &s;oap; or if not at hand, your own urine. Be careful to wa&s;h between the folds, or round the glands; and when you get home, u&s;e the following&mdash;calomel
<PB N="30" REF="29">1 &s;cruple, ro&s;e-water 2 ounces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot &s;peak too highly of this preparation; it is the mo&s;t &s;afe and efficacious application to old ulcers and cancers of every kind, it producing good matter in a few dre&s;&s;ings; and when the ears are affected, and di&s;charge a foetid matter, they &s;hould be &s;yringed with it three or four times a day.</NOTE>, and leave &s;ome of it on. Some throw it up the parts with a &s;y|ringe, and they are &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s; even if a &s;light gonorrhoea has taken place, it will cure without any further application. In women it is the be&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, and &s;afe&s;t remedy; not only here, but al&s;o in the flower albus; it being thrown up the va|gina 3 times a-day, and the patient taking a little bark to &s;trengthen and brace the &s;y&s;tem, nothing el&s;e is further required. By having this by them, they may at all times keep free from the di&s;ea&s;e. Some chu&s;e to rub a &s;mall quantity of blue mercu|rial ointment on the groin and parts; this too, like the other, is certainly de&s;troying the infection
<PB N="31" REF="30">in the bud, and advi&s;able when the other cannot be procured; but there is one caution, always to have the calomel pure and mild: what I prepare for the purpo&s;e, and for private practice, under|goes a number of wa&s;hings in lime water, &amp;c. to take off every minute particle of acid.</P>
