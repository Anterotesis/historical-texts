<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have been many Years a Debtor to the World, and &s;ince I have not as yet been able to pay off my old Scores, to my own Satisfaction, the following Di&s;&s;ertation comes out by way of Compo&s;ition:
<PB N="vi" REF="3">which I hope will be accepted in part of Payment, till the original Debt can be di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>That this comes out alone, is from an Impre&s;&s;ion that I have had upon my Spirits for &s;ome Weeks pa&s;t, that it would be highly criminal in me to let another Mi&s;letoe Sea&s;on pa&s;s, without inform|ing the World what a Trea|&s;ure God Almighty has every Year pre&s;ented to their View; and that no body, at lea&s;t very few, have received any Benefit from it.</P>
<P>The Article of <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> in the Bills of Mortality of this great City, is by much the
<PB N="vii" REF="4">large&s;t of any, very common|ly amounting to about a fifth Part of the Whole; and, as I have been credibly inform'd, happens principally among&s;t Infant Children: from whence it &s;eems plain, that a Gene|rous Anti-Convul&s;ive Remedy is wanting. I have publi&s;h'd the Noble Qualities of this Wonderful Medicine, in the mo&s;t plain and familiar man|ner, that thereby it may be rendred of more publick U&s;e; and I am not without the greate&s;t Hopes that People of all Ranks will receive Benefit from it.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be blamed for the Earne&s;tne&s;s of my Re|commendation
<PB N="viii" REF="5">of this Neg|lected, but Extraordinary Plant; becau&s;e my only Aim in &s;o doing, is to pre&s;s People to the U&s;e of that, which every Family may one time or other receive Advantage from.</P>
<P>The Performance is rough and unpoli&s;h'd; but I have cho&s;en rather to &s;uffer Re|proach upon that account, than let another Sea&s;on &s;lip, which I am &s;atisfied would be to the Detriment of many.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING <HI>MISLETOE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HAVING &s;ome Years &s;ince had a very terrible In&s;tance of an Epileptical Ca&s;e in one that was mo&s;t near and dear unto me, and which baffled all Endea|vours that were u&s;ed for his Recovery; it occa&s;ion'd me many &s;ad and &s;erious Reflections upon the Subject. As he
<PB N="2" REF="7">was daily before my Eyes, &s;o his Di&s;|tre&s;s made the more &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;|&s;ions upon me. I had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t Celebrated Remedies recommend|ed in all Ages, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Friends mo&s;t Eminent in their Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Four or five Years were &s;pent in fruitle&s;s Attempts, he every Year grow|ing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till at la&s;t he be|came Cataleptick: he would be &s;eiz'd as he was &s;tanding, and continue in that po&s;ture like a lifele&s;s Statue, with|out Sen&s;e or Motion. When he was &s;o &s;eiz'd, he was con&s;tantly laid upon a Bed or Couch; his Fit would la&s;t &s;ome Hours: but I am confident, that had he been let alone, he would have continued in the &s;ame po&s;ture in which he was &s;eiz'd, during the whole time of the Fit.</P>
<P>Being one day upon a Journey, I &s;aw &s;ome Hazle-Trees plentifully &s;tock'd with Mi&s;letoe. It immediately enter'd into my Mind, that there mu&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="8">be &s;omething extraordinary in that un|common beautiful Plant; that the Almighty had de&s;ign'd it for farther and more noble U&s;es, than barely to feed Thru&s;hes, or to be hung up &s;u|per&s;titiou&s;ly in Hou&s;es to drive away evil Spirits; and that the Mi&s;letoe that grew upon other Trees, was ca|pable of being as &s;erviceable to Man|kind, as that which grew upon the Oak.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many other Authors that have wrote concerning the Epilep&s;y, I had lately read <HI>Marcus Marci,</HI> his <HI>Litur|gia Mentis;</HI> the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory Trea|ti&s;e upon the Subject, as to Theory, that I have met with, and indeed to lay a Foundation for a Phy&s;ician to practi&s;e rationally in the Cure of all Convul&s;ive Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Having made the mo&s;t &s;trict Inquiry into the Nature of Mi&s;letoe that I was capable of, I concluded, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> That it was a Medicine very likely to &s;ubdue not only the Epilep&s;y, but all
<PB N="4" REF="9">other Convul&s;ive Di&s;orders, upon the foot of <HI>Marcus Marci</HI>'s Hypothe&s;is. I mean the ordinary and common Mi|&s;letoe. The Prai&s;es of Mi&s;letoe of the Oak had been proclaim'd for many Ages pa&s;t, and none el&s;e e&s;teem'd or regarded, as to any Medicinal Virtue.</P>
<P>The Youth before mentioned had indeed taken Mi&s;letoe in &s;mall quan|tities in the <HI>Pulvis de Guttet&acirc;,</HI> and other Compound Remedies recommended in Epileptical Ca&s;es; but when I re|flected that Mi&s;letoe was but one In|gredient among&s;t a <HI>Farrago</HI> of others, there was no determining from the Effects of tho&s;e Medicines, whether Mi&s;letoe were capable of doing any thing towards the conquering of &s;o <HI>Herculean</HI> a Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>In reading the &s;catter'd and imper|fect Accounts of the <HI>Druids,</HI> formerly Prie&s;ts and Philo&s;ophers in this I&s;land and other neighbouring Countries, who were had in the highe&s;t Venera|tion by People of all Ranks; I con|jectur'd
<PB N="5" REF="10">that this Veneration in great mea&s;ure proceeded from the Wonder|ful Cures they wrought by means of the Mi&s;letoe of the Oak: this Tree being &s;acred to them, but none &s;o, that had not Mi&s;letoe upon them; which Con&s;ideration al&s;o further prompted me to try common Mi&s;le|toe in its utmo&s;t extent. After I had &s;een &s;ome of its amazing Effects, I conclude that it was from this Divine Remedy that they had almo&s;t Divine Honours paid them.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;letoe of the Oak being the only Mi&s;letoe recommended as good for any thing, I was in great Straits how to procure a quantity of it; for I did not remember in all my Tra|vels to have &s;een any of it: &s;o among&s;t all my Acquaintance, from that time to this, I do not know that I have met with above two that have.</P>
<P>This put me upon con&s;idering whe|ther or no the Mi&s;letoe receiv'd any Advantage from the Tree upon which
<PB N="6" REF="11">it grew, or whether all Mi&s;letoe were not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>After my Thoughts had been &s;ome time employ'd upon this Subject, I concluded that the Mi&s;letoe of the Crab, the Lime, the Pear, or any other Tree, were of equal Virtue with that of the Oak, for the following Rea&s;ons; and which has been con|firm'd to me &s;ince by large Experience, which is beyond every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e that the Mi&s;letoe of the Oak does &s;urpa&s;s that of all other Trees; yet from ten Years large Ex|perience I find the ordinary Mi&s;letoe to be the mo&s;t Noble Medicine I ever knew: and &s;ince it's every where to be had, at lea&s;t in this I&s;land, it ought to be e&s;teem'd as a great Ble&s;&s;ing; and if the other excel it, tho&s;e that are capable of procuring it, ought to e&s;teem it accordingly.</P>
<P>But if the Mi&s;letoe were in any manner produced from the Tree upon which it grows, as the Gaul is from
<PB N="7" REF="12">the Oak; then it might rea&s;onably be expected that it &s;hould partake of the Quality of the Tree that produces it, as the Gaul does, having the &s;ame &s;tip|tick Qualities with the Acorn, or the Bark of the Tree. But as it's propa|gated by the way of Inoculating, or Grafting, it's quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>An Apricock or a Peach grafted upon a Plumb-Stock, or a fine Apple or Pear upon a Crab-Tree one, will not produce Plumbs or Crabs, but Apricocks and Peaches, and fine Pears and Apples.</P>
<P>As far as I can learn, Mi&s;letoe is commonly propagated after the fol|lowing manner: There is a Bird ge|nerally known by the Name of the Mi&s;letoe Thru&s;h; which Name, I &s;up|po&s;e, it derives from its feeding upon Mi&s;letoe-Berries during the Winter Sea|&s;on. From the Pulp of the Berries it is nouri&s;hed, but the Seeds are di&s;|charged with the Excrement undige&s;ted. Now the Excrement being of a &s;limy
<PB N="8" REF="13">nature, &s;ticks fa&s;t to the Branches of the Trees upon which it falls; and if there be any Crack in the Bark, there the Seed lodges it&s;elf, and produces a Plant the next Year. The Excrement being of the nature of Birdlime, and Birdlime, as it's &s;aid, being to be made of the Berries of the Plant; I &s;uppo&s;e gave ri&s;e to that very old Say|ing, That <HI>Turdus cacat in &s;ui Excidium.</HI></P>
<P>It has been often propagated by cut|ting a Slit into the Bark of a Tree, and &s;ticking in a Seed. I have been told of one that has adorn'd his Trees with it, to make them delightful in the Winter-Sea&s;on; and &s;urely a more beautiful Plant can &s;carce be &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays, That it is apt to exhau&s;t and wear out the Tree upon which it grows: in which I am inclined to be|lieve he was mi&s;taken. The Rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, that induced him to be of that Opinion, was, That it mo&s;t fre|quently grows upon old Trees. Now I conclude, that it more frequently
<PB N="9" REF="14">grows upon them than young ones, becau&s;e the Twigs and Branches of the old Trees are more liable to Cracks and Accidents than young ones are: and being mo&s;t commonly &s;een upon old Trees, he from thence concluded that they were worn out by it.</P>
<P>There &s;eems however to be a Dif|ference betwixt this Plant and all other Trees propagated by Grafting or In|oculating; they being mo&s;t certainly intirely nouri&s;hed by the Juice of the Stock into which they are in&s;erted: notwith&s;tanding which, as is before ob&s;erv'd, they change the Nature of the Juice, brought up by the Stock, into their own. But whether Mi&s;letoe receives its full Nouri&s;hment from the Juice of the Tree, &s;eems to me a Doubt. It's true, it continues alive during the Summer, but it does not begin to flouri&s;h and appear in Vi|gour, till the Sap of the Tree is fallen, or otherwi&s;e &s;pent, and the Leaves dropt. Its Berries are full ripe, and
<PB REF="15">in perfection, about the latter end of <HI>December;</HI> and the more rigorous and &s;evere the Weather is, the more vigo|rous and flouri&s;hing is the Mi&s;letoe. Now con&s;idering that the Sap or nu|tritious Juice of the Tree is at this time in a manner &s;pent, I am inclin'd to conjecture that it derives its princi|pal Support from the Air. I have had &s;ome thoughts that it was no hard matter to try, by ea&s;y Experiments, whether this be &s;o or not; but being confin'd to the Town, I have wanted Conveniencies of &s;o doing.</P>
<P>How it thrives in hot Countries, or whether it ever grows upon tho&s;e Trees that never ca&s;t their Leaves, I am ig|norant of.</P>
<P>Of all the antient Authors that take notice of it, which I have read, <HI>Pliny</HI> in his <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> &s;eems to be mo&s;t full; but what he &s;ays, is little to the purpo&s;e: and almo&s;t every body el&s;e recommends Mi&s;letoe of the Oak in Epileptical Ca&s;es, but none of them
<PB N="11" REF="16">give Directions how even that &s;hould be u&s;ed in a rational manner.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Moderns, the Ho|nourable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> in the &s;econd Part of his <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s of Experimental Philo&s;o|phy,</HI> pag. 174. gives the following Re|lation.</P>
<P><Q>"A young Lady of great Birth having been long troubled with an almo&s;t Hereditary Epileptical Di&s;|temper, and after having been wea|ry'd by Cour&s;es of Phy&s;ick pre&s;crib'd her by the famou&s;e&s;t Doctors that could be procured, without at all mending, but rather growing wor&s;e; &s;o that &s;ometimes &s;he would have in one day eight or ten of &s;uch di&s;mal Fits as you and I have &s;een her in; was cured only by the Powder of the true Mi&s;letoe of the Oak, given as much as would lie upon a Sixpence, early in the Morning, in Black-Cherry Water, or even in Beer, for &s;ome days near the full Moon. And I am a&s;&s;ured, partly by the Patient
<PB N="12" REF="17">her&s;elf, and partly by tho&s;e that gave her the Medicine, that though it had &s;carce any &s;en&s;ible Operation upon her, and did not make her &s;icki&s;h, e&s;pecially when &s;he &s;lept upon it; yet after the fir&s;t day &s;he took it, &s;he never had but one Fit. And this Remedy an antient Gentleman, who, being ca&s;ually pre&s;ent when &s;he &s;uddenly fell down as dead, gave it her, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf con&s;tantly to have cured that Di&s;temper with it, when he could procure the right Sim|ple, which is here exceeding &s;carce. And what further Experiments &s;ome Friends of yours have &s;ucce&s;sfully made, I may el&s;ewhere have occa|&s;ion to relate."</Q></P>
<P>My mo&s;t worthy Friend Dr. <HI>Cole,</HI> encouraged by the common Voice of Antiquity, and being farther prompted to it by this Relation of Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> was induced to try what it would do upon a Patient that fell into his hands by the Death of his former Phy&s;ician,
<PB N="13" REF="18">who for three Months had in vain been attempting his Cure. He relates the Ca&s;e and the Circum&s;tances of his Cure as follows.</P>
<P><Q>"A certain Youth of a &s;prightly Genius, of about fifteen Years of Age, who at fir&s;t had laboured un|der a Fever, from which he was per|fectly freed, was &s;oon after attack'd with an Epileptical Fit, which was about three Months &s;ince: after a few days another, and after that with many, but without any regular Pe|riods. The&s;e Fits had &s;o affected his Nerves, and brought &s;uch a Weakne&s;s upon all his Joints, that he could not walk without difficulty, nor lift the Weight of a few Ounces with his Hands, nor hold a Pen to write withal, in which he before ex|celled. To this Youth various Re|medies having before been given without &s;ucce&s;s, I pre&s;cribed a Vo|mit of Salt of Vitriol; then a Purge or two with &s;ome Calomel. After|wards
<PB N="14" REF="19">I took care that Mi&s;letoe of the Oak &s;hould be given him twice a day, with &s;ome Cephalick Vehicle; and the Apothecary had procured the Mi&s;letoe that was genuine: (Hap|py he! for to this time I could ne|ver procure any.) Proceeding in this order, his Fits never returned. The Mi&s;letoe being continued to this time, he &s;en&s;ibly perceiv'd a gradual Re&s;toration of the Strength of all the Parts; &s;o that he could now not only walk, but run, and write elegantly, of which I was an Eye-witne&s;s. So that I have rea&s;on to hope, that from the continued U&s;e of this Medicine, he may be per|fectly freed from his Illne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Good Doctor was one of tho&s;e that afforded his utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Youth before mention'd; but no Mi&s;letoe of the Oak being to be procured, all other Mi&s;letoe was look'd upon as de&s;picable; and the rea&s;on why the <HI>Pulvis de Guttet&acirc;</HI> did no
<PB N="15" REF="20">good, was judg'd to proceed from the Apothecaries making u&s;e of common Mi&s;letoe in the Compo&s;ition of it, in|&s;tead of that of the Oak. But be that as it will, and let the Difference be never &s;o great, the quantity of Mi&s;le|toe in that Compo&s;ition is &s;o &s;mall, as to render it of no effect. And as for the Mi&s;letoe contain'd in the Anti-Epileptick Waters, the Great <HI>Zwelfer</HI> has remark'd, that it will not yield any of its Virtues by ordinary Di&s;tillation.</P>
<P>Mi&s;letoe of the Oak not being to be obtain'd, I furni&s;h'd my&s;elf with a large quantity of that of the Lime; the Trees in one of the Parks at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> affording great plenty, at lea&s;t they did &s;o at that time. I order'd it to be gather'd at the latter end of <HI>December:</HI> The Leaves, Ber|ries, and very tender Twigs, I got dry'd over a Baker's Oven, where there was a con&s;tant gentle Heat, and then had it made into very fine Pow|der, to be put into a Gla&s;s cover'd with
<PB N="16" REF="21">Bladder or Leather, and kept in a very dry place. If it be not kept clo&s;e and dry, it will contract a Dampne&s;s, grow mouldy, and be good for no|thing: If it be &s;corch'd by the Fire in drying, it will al&s;o be &s;poil'd, and of no effect.</P>
<P>The larger Stalks mu&s;t al&s;o be care|fully dry'd and pre&s;erv'd, for Decoc|tions and Infu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Furni&s;h'd with my Medicine, though of no Reputation, not being &s;u&s;pended upon the Oak; I was very impatient to &s;ee the Effect of it, and immediate|ly went to work with it.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Youth had for five Years been labouring in vain, and eve|ry Month grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e; &s;o that his Con&s;titution both of Body and Mind were &s;poil'd to &s;uch a de|gree, that I could not be &s;o pre&s;ump|tuous as to hope for a Cure: The ut|mo&s;t I could wi&s;h for, was &s;ome Re|lief, and to render the Remainder of his Life &s;omeway comfortable to him.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="22">
<P>From being one of the &s;prightlie&s;t of Youths at Twelve Years of Age, at Seventeen he was a perfect Mope, a mo&s;t melancholy Spectacle both in and out of his Fits. However, bad as he was, having carefully inquired into the Nature of my Medicine, I went to work with it; I was &s;ure it could do him no hurt, if it did him no good.</P>
<P>His Fits in the beginning kept pace with the Moon, rarely having any but about the New or the Full; but in Tract of Time he had them at all Sea&s;ons: &s;o I began with him, with|out any regard to that Affair.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t I gave him half a Dram of the Powder, made into a Bolus with Syrup of Pioneys, every &s;ix Hours; and after it a large Draught of a &s;trong Infu&s;ion of the Stalks brui&s;ed, and &s;weetned with Syrup of Pioneys.</P>
<P>To my great &s;urprize he had not one Fit from the time he began to take
<PB N="18" REF="23">this Glorious Medicine for a Month or more, and never one Cataleptick Fit to the day of his Death. He con|tinued to take it on for three Years, but after &s;ome Months, only Night and Morning; and in the main, du|ring that whole Space, he enjoy'd his Health tolerably well. But as his Memory had been almo&s;t intirely lo&s;t by the former Five-Years Calamity, &s;o it was not judg'd proper to &s;et him to any &s;ort of hard Study, or employ him in any Bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;hould give him any trouble: Upon which &s;core it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him into the Country, to a good AIr, with one con&s;tantly to keep him company, and to &s;ecure him again&s;t Accidents.</P>
<P>There he lived, with great Com|fort to him&s;elf, and Plea&s;ure to tho&s;e he convers'd with; and was &s;ome|times capable of applying him&s;elf to his Studies. He would now and then have a Fit, but &s;ometimes not one in three Months; and tho&s;e Fits he had,
<PB N="19" REF="24">very favourable ones, which he had al|ways Warnings of before-hand, &s;o that he could be tru&s;ted on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he was taken ill, in a man|ner different from what he had former|ly been, and died in about four and twenty Hours. I could not &s;ee him after he was dead, but de&s;ired that his Head &s;hould be open'd; having great rea&s;on to believe, that the beginning of his Illne&s;s proceeded from an un|fortunate Blow upon the left Temple, in which Part he would often com|plain of great Pain, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t part of his Illne&s;s, before he be|came &s;tupid. And the Account I had of that matter, was, That there was a blacki&s;h Spot upon the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> of the bigne&s;s of a Shilling, ju&s;t under the <HI>Os Temporis.</HI></P>
<P>It's true here was no Cure, neither could I expect one: I had the utmo&s;t Succe&s;s I could rea&s;onably propo&s;e to my&s;elf, which was to render the &s;hort Remains of a mi&s;erable Life com|fortable
<PB N="20" REF="25">and ea&s;y: And by &s;o doing, to have a rea&s;onable Opportunity of introducing to the World a mo&s;t Glo|rious and U&s;eful Medicine; which has one peculiar Property attending it, That it is capable of doing the greate&s;t Good in the mo&s;t formidable of Di&s;|ea&s;es, and, I dare &s;ay, will never do any Hurt.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits Bark is a mo&s;t Noble Medicine in Fevers regularly intermit|ting, and in &s;ome other Ca&s;es: but I have frequently known the Mi&s;applica|tion of it, of terrible and fatal con&s;e|quence. But for Mi&s;letoe, I dare en|gage for it, that it will never hurt any one; and tho it be &s;o innocent, yet it will frequently cure Di&s;ea&s;es, that in appearance (as the Great Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> re|pre&s;ents them, in his De&s;cription of the Epilep&s;y, in his Tract <HI>de Morbis Convul&s;ivis</HI>) do not much differ from tho&s;e we read of in the Go&s;pels, that were cured by the Redeemer of the World, the Eternal Son of God: But
<PB N="21" REF="26">his Cures were wrought by a Word, and not by Medicines. Glory be to him, that in the ab&s;ence of him&s;elf has created &s;uch Medicines for the Re|lief of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as this I am treating of!</P>
<P>No one can think that I am &s;o far dive&s;ted of Rea&s;on, as to recommend this Medicine in the manner I do, there not being the lea&s;t Pro&s;pect of Advantage to my&s;elf in it; but that I am &s;ure of its Effects, from thorough Experience, and that I have all ima|ginable Rea&s;on to believe that it will prove of general advantage to the World: there not being a Family, to which it may not at one time or other be of the greate&s;t u&s;e.</P>
<P>I have many times known about a Scruple of the Powder, mix'd with a little Black-Cherry Water, re&s;tore Chil|dren that have been agonizing with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Convul&s;ions that can be conceived; but then it has been repeated in le&s;s quantity very often,
<PB N="22" REF="27">till they were perfectly well. I hardly ever knew it given to Children with|out advantage: A Cure is not always to be expected, but Relief is a great Ble&s;&s;ing in &s;uch mi&s;erable Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It's good in their Gripes, either to obtund the Acrimony of the Bile or Pancreatick Juices; and if they will not take it any other way, may be given in their Pap, Pannadoe, or Brea&s;t-Milk. Even to Infants there can be no Error in giving them too much, but the more they take, the better; it being of a nouri&s;hing Quality, and no ways hot, or in the lea&s;t tending to throw them into a Fever; nay, is ra|ther of it&s;elf a Febrifuge. I have often found it of great u&s;e in the di&s;mal &s;low Fevers, attended with Convul&s;ive Symptoms.</P>
<P>I have never, through the Cour&s;e of my Practice, &s;een but two Per&s;ons la|bouring under that frightful Di&s;temper called the <HI>Chorea Sancti Vitis,</HI> or St. <HI>Vi|tes</HI>'s Dance; or at lea&s;t that might be
<PB N="23" REF="28">truly called &s;o. The fir&s;t was before I knew the U&s;e of Mi&s;letoe: She had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Phy&s;icians be|&s;ides me; but in &s;pite of all that could be done, &s;he died mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>About three Years &s;ince, the &s;econd, a Girl of about Seven Years of Age, was brought to me. Every Mu&s;cle of her &s;eem'd to be convuls'd; if &s;he were upon her Feet, &s;he was always danc|ing, and throwing her Arms about; the Mu&s;cles of her Face would be variou&s;|ly di&s;torted, and her Head moving backward or forward, or from &s;ide to &s;ide, &s;o as to be a mo&s;t moving Ob|ject of Compa&s;&s;ion. If &s;he were in Bed, &s;he was under the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances; one being obliged to be con|&s;tantly by her, to keep the Clothes upon her, and &s;he had no Sleep. She took about two Drams of the Powder every day, and by that time &s;he had taken twelve or fourteen Ounces, &s;he was made perfectly well, and &s;o con|tinues. She grew better by that time
<PB N="24" REF="29">&s;he had taken it two days, and in a manner well in about a Fortnight; but I order'd the Continuance of the Me|dicine, till &s;he had taken the quantity before mention'd, to &s;ecure her again&s;t Returns.</P>
<P>I have an intimate Acquaintance, an exellent Gentlewoman, who had labour'd under Convul&s;ive Di&s;orders for twenty Years, and did not want the be&s;t Advice; her Life was render'd thoroughly mi&s;erable: But by the U&s;e of the Powder of Mi&s;letoe for a Year or two, &s;he is become perfectly well, enjoying the Comfort of Life as much as any one does.</P>
<P>I have known &s;o many In&s;tances, both in Young and Old, in Rich and Poor of both Sexes, &s;ome of whom had been many Years afflicted with Epilep&s;ies, and other Convul&s;ive Di&s;|orders, that have been either cured or received Benefit from this Divine Re|medy; that I think my&s;elf bound in Con&s;cience to divulge the U&s;e of it to
<PB N="25" REF="30">the World; &s;ince, as I have be|fore ob&s;erv'd, it is capable of doing greater things than ever I knew per|form'd by any one Remedy, and I think it uncapable of doing any Hurt.</P>
<P>Another principal Rea&s;on that has induced me to it, is for the &s;ake of the Poor, the Meane&s;t being able to procure it as well as the Rich, and that it wants little or no Skill in the Admini&s;tration of it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Virtues of Mi&s;letoe were confin'd to that of the Oak only, it was of little or no U&s;e to the World, as not being to be procured. I have been five and thirty Years a diligent Searcher after it, but never could yet &s;ee one Sprig; and as I have before ob&s;erv'd, have never met with above two that had. If the common Mi&s;le|toe that is to be met with in every County of our Fortunate I&s;land, is capable of doing as great things, as have ever been recorded of the Mi&s;le|toe
<PB N="26" REF="31">of the Oak; I &s;hall have that Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction of Mind, which generally redounds to tho&s;e that have the Happine&s;s of being Be|nefactors to the Age they live in, which I have in every Part and Cir|cum&s;tance of Life endeavour'd.</P>
<P>But if from the common Voice of all Ages, and the modern In&s;tances I have produced, Mi&s;letoe of the Oak mu&s;t &s;till be prefer'd; I do not doubt but every Oak in <HI>England</HI> may be made to produce Mi&s;letoe, by the Me|thod I have before propos'd. And perhaps the <HI>Druids</HI> took that Method to propagate it upon &s;uch Oaks as were for their turn. And when that can be had in plenty, it will be no great difficulty to di&s;tingui&s;h whether it excels or not: But I am really of opinion, that all Mi&s;letoe is the &s;ame, for the Rea&s;ons before alledg'd.</P>
<P>In this Di&s;&s;ertation I have carefully avoided entering into the Rea&s;on why Mi&s;letoe is &s;o excellent a Remedy in
<PB N="27" REF="32">Epilep&s;ies, and of con&s;equence in all other Convul&s;ive Di&s;tempers; but re|commend it to the U&s;e of the World from the large Experience I have had of it, which is the &s;ame way that the famous <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark was u&s;her'd in: and perhaps the Experience of future Practitioners may make that matter more clear, than at pre&s;ent I am ca|pable of doing. Nay, &s;hould I at|tempt it, it would &s;well the Bulk, and of con&s;equence the Price of this Di&s;|&s;ertation, and be of no advantage to the ordinary &s;ort of People, who&s;e Benefit by this Publication I propo&s;e as much as the Rich.</P>
<P>I began with it upon a Rational Foundation, and the Succe&s;s has an|&s;wer'd my Expectation, even to my Amazement in &s;ome In&s;tances. I don't doubt but others will try whe|ther what I have &s;aid be true; and when they &s;ee that it an&s;wers their Ex|pectations al&s;o, I hope it will exerci&s;e the fine Genius's of the Age, to draw
<PB N="28" REF="33">Con&s;equences from it, that may be of great u&s;e.</P>
<P>As the Bark does &s;ometimes want an Auxiliary, to enable it intirely to overcome an ob&s;tinate Quartan Ague; &s;o I have &s;ometimes found that Mi&s;le|toe has done better in &s;ome ob&s;tinate old Epilep&s;ies, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Auxiliary, than alone.</P>
<P>A Dram of <HI>Sal Martis</HI> added to an Ounce of the Bark, will make that Ounce more effectually to cure an in|veterate Quartan, than &s;ix times the quantity of the Bark alone will do without it: So I have &s;ometimes known a Dram of <HI>A&s;&s;a-foetida</HI> added to an Ounce of the Mi&s;letoe Powder, and made into an Electuary, make it act much more powerfully than a|lone.</P>
<P>Gentle Purging, and &s;ometimes Bleeding, are u&s;eful before the giving of the Mi&s;letoe: but I have been for &s;ome Years afraid of giving Vomits, even of the gentle&s;t &s;ort, in Convul|&s;ive
<PB N="29" REF="34">Di&s;tempers, from &s;ome terrible Accidents that have been like to en&s;ue, from moderate Do&s;es of Ipecacuana it&s;elf; the &s;afe&s;t, and perhaps the be&s;t Vomit, that ever was made known to the World, barely as a Vomit to clean&s;e the Stomach.</P>
<P>If the Plant be not dry'd, powder'd, and pre&s;erv'd in the manner I have directed, there is &s;carce any other way of keeping it, but that it will be ren|dred intirely u&s;ele&s;s. This I de&s;ire may be carefully ob&s;erv'd by every body.</P>
<P>I don't doubt but even Mi&s;letoe of the Oak it&s;elf, or what People have called &s;o, has often un&s;ucce&s;sfully been given, from not being gather'd in right time; or if it has been &s;o, ei|ther ill dry'd, or not carefully pre|&s;erved afterwards.</P>
<P>From the Hints I have given, I hope others will be di&s;po&s;ed to try this Medicine to a further Extent than I have been able to do: I have been
<PB N="30" REF="35">cramp'd in it, becau&s;e it was not to be had in more than two Apotheca|ries Shops, that I could depend upon for its being regularly managed. But for the future, &s;ince it will put them but to very &s;mall Expence, I hope no Shop in the Kingdom will be with|out it.</P>
<P>If any one will be &s;o good, as to communicate to me any, either Medi|cinal or Natural Ob&s;ervations, that they have already, or &s;hall hereafter make, in relation to the Subject here treated of, they &s;hall not fail of my mo&s;t Grateful Acknowledgments.</P>
