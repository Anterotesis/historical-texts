<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY inscribing the following trifle to you, I enjoy the highest of gratifications, as it furnishes me with an opportunity of publicly thanking you, for that noble exertion of justice and independence, which, at the same time that it defeated political im|posture, recorded your names in letters of adamant among the glorious assertors of your country's rights.</P>
<P>To you, indeed, the following pages almost exclusively belong: they were written during my dreary confinement in the Tower; they were seized with my other papers, <HI>after a bill of indictment was found against me;</HI> and it is to your courage, justice&punc;
<PB N="II" REF="3">and discernment, that I now live to lay them before the world, after having been detained from me till the 20th of February last.</P>
<P>In pronouncing my acquittal, you did not vio|late your own feelings. It would, indeed, be an affront to your understandings, enlightened as they were by the manly eloquence of an Adam and a Gurney, to suppose that you would give the least credit <HI>to four mere hearsay</HI> witnesses, in|consitent with each other and with themselves; more especially when one was proved a noto|rious liar and insane; two others appeared to have been actuated by malice, a fourth did not know me when he saw me, and never had a moment's conversation with me in his life; nor did one of them, except the madman, pretend to any degree of intimacy with me. Whether it was probable that I should have made <HI>him</HI> my confidant was certainly no very intricate question. Yet these were the witnesses on whose credibility my shameless persecutors rested their case: nor can I assign any reason for the de|lay of my trial, except that of rendering it impossible for me to controvert their evidence. This plan (if it really was laid) had almost proved successful; for, of near seventy witnesses, whose names I had given in to my Solicitor, only two, owing to this very delay, could be procured. Had the business been brought on at an earlier period, not one of the four <HI>hearsay</HI> witnesses would, in all probability, have ventured into court; at least if he had, he would hardly have escaped a conviction for wilful per|jury, so completely false was the whole of <HI>this</HI> evidence.</P>
<PB N="III" REF="4">
<P>The pretended death of Upton was, perhaps, the most curious piece of evidence ever produced or ad|mitted in a court: his wife had <HI>been told</HI> by a water|man that he was drowned: this <HI>hearsay</HI> evidence was to serve as a proof of his being able to demonstrate what the other four <HI>hearsay</HI> witnesses pretended to have heard, and you were <HI>supposed</HI> to be perfectly convinced by this unsupported report, that <HI>four</HI> dis|cordant stories were <HI>all true.</HI> Whether to admire most the excessive candour of the court, in refusing to hear evidence of Upton being then alive, or the exceeding modesty of the Attorney-general, in ad|mitting the fact, I do not really know; but, it seems, it availed nothing to prove him to be living, unless we could prove him to have been kept away by the prosecutors; and for that we had <HI>only Upton's own word.</HI> In my opinion, they <HI>might</HI> have produced him; for it can hardly be believed, that, if they wished him to appear, they would have suffered a man to go at large, whose prevarication had for|merly induced them to commit him to prison: but had the Attorney-general brought forward in evi|dence, as a proof of my guilt, that the Pope was seen in a gin-shop in St. Giles's, I am not sure whether I should, by the same rule have been allowed to set up an <HI>alibi</HI> on the part of his Holiness, <HI>unless I could prove he was kept away by authority.</HI></P>
<P>It was stated that I run away to Bristol to secrete myself; but this flight proved only a visit to a friend who had given me an invitation, and my secreting did not, it seems, extend either to my person or my sentiments. My leaving England was not out of any fear of a prosecution, it was simply in conse|quence of a plan I had long before formed of visiting
<PB N="IV" REF="5">the southern hemisphere for the purpose of cultivat|ing natural history; I had provided every thing ne|cessary for bringing home an extensive collection, together with an astronomical, chemical, and anato|mical aparatus. Having once made up my mind to go, and prepared for the voyage, I certainly should not have staid an hour in consequence of any message or summons whatever; however I received neither. I sailed in January, and about a month after it was publicly known that I was gone, out came a procla|mation offering a reward of two hundred pounds for apprehending me.</P>
<P>During my confinement in the Tower, when I was deprived of every means of vindicating myself, no pains were spared to prejudice the public opinion against me; a practice the more base and unwarrant|able, as the law of England holds it a very high of|fence to print or write any thing that may tend to influence a decision even in the most trifling matters. In my case it amounted to a premeditated murder; but, thanks to your honest and independent minds, this villanous attempt was frustrated!</P>
<P>To those, however, who are acquainted with mi|nisterial papers and ministerial scribblers, it can be no matter of surprise that you as well as myself have been exposed to the grossest, falsest, and most scurri|lous libels. In fact, as no prosecution could more completely terminate in the disgrace of the prosecu|tors, the virulence of their hirelings, must be expect|ed to display itself in the most extravagant manner; and since the witnesses brought forward could not persuade you that I deserved to be hanged, the next step naturally was to endeavour to persuade the world that <HI>you</HI> did. Yet, as you well know, nothing that
<PB N="V" REF="6">could even be quibbled into a treasonable act appeared in evidence against me.</P>
<P>For my own part, I have been highly en|tertained by their railing: and there is even a satisfaction in reflecting, that a poor scoundrel, whom no body would believe either on his word or his oath, can procure a dinner by scribbling an inno|cent lie on you or me in a ministerial paper. Nay, we do not know but we may have saved some of these miserable wretches from Botany Bay, since they might, perhaps, if they had not made a little money of our names, have been driven to the despe|rate resource of picking a pocket.</P>
<P>I am in possession of most of their names and haunts (for they have not <HI>all</HI> fixed places of abode), and could, were I so disposed, take a severe revenge upon the greatest part of them, by publishing their addresses, leaving to such of their creditors as may despise or have forgotten the old adage "Sue a beggar," &amp;c. the task of punishing their delinquency.</P>
<P>As it is, I shall honour them with no farther notice than one would bestow on a pack of snappish, hungry curs, who, in hopes of a crust from their masters, are ready to snarl at and bite any innocent passenger that is pointed out to them. I beg pardon for having wasted so much time and paper on such miscreants; but it is the first, and shall be the last time I shall bestow either a word or a thought on a nest of toothless reptiles, who may indeed hiss, but cannot bite. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With the sincerest esteem and respect, GENTLEMEN; Your grateful countryman, R. T. CROSFEILD.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little production, from the nature of the situation in which it was composed, must naturally be expected to abound in imperfec|tions; nor can it boast any merit except its containing a plain and faithful detail of facts. With a desire of benefiting mankind, as well as of solacing the tedious hours of confinement (and what can be a more solacing re&s;lection, than that one is endeavouring to render service to one's fellow-men?) the author committed to writing what he had seen, whilst it was yet fresh in his memory. Denied the access of his friends, ignorant of the specific charge on which he was confined, and unable even to guess at the nature of the evidence to be adduced against him, (which the copy of his indictment, when delivered to him, could no way explain, as he was indicted for con|spiring with three men whom he did not even know by sight) he could not but look upon himself as a devoted victim; yet, glowing with contempt for the authors of his injurious treatment, and determined that nothing should discourage him from doing what he thought his duty, he resolved to write, and leave his observations to their fate, hoping that they might perhaps incite some man enjoying greater opportunities, or greater abilities, either to confirm or confute them. Not much order or exactness can therefore be expected in such a work, for he had no books to refer to, nor has he made one alteration since his papers have been re|stored to him, which however might have been done earlier had he known the proper channel of application. To any gentleman whose opinions or labours may have been mistated, overlooked, or mis|understood, he hopes the natural defects of a few pages written solely from memory, will plead a sufficient excuse.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE SCURVY, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Sea Seurvy has been &s;o often and &s;o well treated upon, by various eminent authors, that any additional remarks may &s;eem almo&s;t &s;uperfluous. But as it has been my hap to ob|&s;erve a few facts that may perhaps have been unnoticed by others in &s;imilar &s;ituations, it ap|peared to me an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to commit them to paper, in hopes that they may furni&s;h &s;ome u&s;eful hints to my fellow-labourers in the medical art.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of this di&s;ea&s;e, either with re&s;pect to its &s;ymptoms, ri&s;e, or progre&s;s, is too well known to need repetition; I &s;hall, there|fore, content my&s;elf with remarking, that, among the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners in France, there was &s;carcely any malady who&s;e appearance it did not put on, though a few days always cleared up the deception.</P>
<P>That the &s;curvy &s;hould lurk under the ma&s;k of rheumati&s;m or a&s;thma was, indeed, nowi&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="9">&s;urpri&s;ing; but it &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hed me to meet with it under the complete re&s;emblance of pleuri&s;y; particularly in the months of June and July. I knew too much of this in&s;idious enemy, to &s;uffer my&s;elf to be deceived by a full, or even pretty hard pul&s;e; but I once had the curio&s;ity to draw about four ounces of blood from an otherwi&s;e healthy and robu&s;t young man, to &s;atisfy my&s;elf as to the pre&s;ence of the inflammatory cru&s;t. The event, however, &s;hewed the great propriety of ab&s;taining from phlebotomy, even in tho&s;e ea&s;es that &s;eem mo&s;t to demand it; for the blood, during its flowing, exhibited a very remarkable broken &s;parkling, and, as it were, &s;andy a&s;pect; nor did it, on &s;tanding, &s;eparate into &s;erum and era&s;&s;amen|tum, as u&s;ual, but remained in a ma&s;s of various hues, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing but little firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the &s;curvy often borrowed the&s;e forms, it mo&s;t frequently a&s;&s;umed its ordinary &s;ymptoms:&mdash;the&s;e were &s;tinking breath, &s;welled, &s;pongy, and bloody gums, tumours, &s;tiffne&s;s of the joints (particularly of the knees), black, brown, purple, or livid &s;pots, &s;ome no larger than a flea-bite, others very large, re&s;embling brui&s;es, accompanied by great debility and dejection of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy has formerly been erroneou&s;ly repre&s;ented by &s;ome as a new di&s;ea&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was said to have first appeared in 1556; but Dr. Solomon de Leon, in an "Inaugural Dissertation," published at Leyden, in 1790, proves clearly that it was known to the Ancients under the name of <HI>Stomacace.</HI></NOTE> and the almo&s;t <HI>peculiar</HI> progeny of cold climates, but experience has &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated that it is no &s;tranger even to the warme&s;t. Cold, e&s;pe|cially when joined with moi&s;ture, has, however,
<PB N="3" REF="10">&s;uch manife&s;t influence in its production, when &s;uperadded to &s;alt, and otherwi&s;e bad diet, that a &s;light &s;ketch of the weather, and treatment we experienced in France may not be ami&s;s.</P>
<P>The latter part of the year 1794, and the be|ginning of 1795, were perhaps as cold as any in the memory of man; nor was the cold confined to one country only; but very &s;everely felt al|mo&s;t through Europe. About the middle of February the weather grew warmer (in France at lea&s;t); but early in March it again became cold and rainy, nor did it remarkably change for the better until the beginning of May, when there were a few fine warm days. At this time cold, chilling, ea&s;terly winds began again to &s;et in, accompanied for the mo&s;t part by rain and remarkably damp weather. Notwith&s;tanding the wind &s;ometimes &s;hifted to the oppo&s;ite points &s;till the &s;ame cold, damp, and un&s;ea&s;onable tem|perature of the air continued; nor did it become more plea&s;ant and &s;ea&s;onable till towards the end of July: after that it continued mild and plea&s;ant till we left France.</P>
<P>During the colds of the early part of &s;pring, mi&s;erable indeed was the &s;tate of too many of our captive countrymen. Several, particularly &s;oldiers belonging to the Loyal Clare regiment had neither beds nor a change of linen; the con&s;equence of which, joined to natural indo|lence and habits of dirt, rendered them the fir&s;t victims of di&s;ea&s;e. Nor were even &s;ome ma&s;ters of merchantmen in a much better &s;ituation; for, having been captured by, or put on board tho&s;e French men of war that were lo&s;t in the &s;torms of the month of January, they were barely able to pre&s;erve their lives with the lo&s;s of every article of their wearing apparel.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<P>The ca&s;tle of Bre&s;t being full of pri&s;oners, many (to the amount of 1200) were forced to be put on board &s;ome old Indiamen, which lay in the harbour, and &s;erved as temporary pri&s;on &s;hips; here they were crouded without di&s;|tinction into confined and dirty apartments, and underwent un&s;peakable hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>It was my lot, on my arrival there, Feb. 23, to be put on board the Elizabeth, which though reputed the mo&s;t tolerable of the whole, was horrid beyond de&s;cription!</P>
<P>We had no place to &s;it down in, even to eat, but the open deck; our diet con&s;i&s;ted of rice &s;oup, or, more properly &s;peaking, rice water, qualified with a little rancid, &s;tinking oil; about &s;ix ounces of bad, cour&s;e, &s;alt beef; and every third day our rice was alternated with a me&s;s of hor&s;e beans, and our beef with &s;alt fi&s;h, or half rotten dried pilchards. We had, how|ever, plenty of good bread, and three half pints of poor &s;mall adulterated wine, but no vegetables whatever, and the wine it &s;eems was withheld from &s;everal of the other &s;hips. The water allotted <HI>us</HI> was foul and putrid, though there was plenty of good water on board, nor was any allowed for the purpo&s;es of cleanline&s;s. Such were the mi&s;eries of the day; but tho&s;e of the night far exceeded them, nor were perhaps ever outdone, unle&s;s by the horrors of the black hole of Calcutta!</P>
<P>The place allotted for us to &s;leep in was a part of the &s;hip's hold, whither we were thru&s;t down at &s;un-&s;et, and which afforded no more than four inches in breadth to &s;ix feet in length for each man. Our number was about 240; many, therefore, were obliged to &s;leep upon the floor, notwith&s;tanding two, and in &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="12">parts three tiers of hammoes had been hung one under the other. After having been in|clo&s;ed in this den of mi&s;ery for about an hour the heat grew intolerable, and the odour ari&s;ing from the effluvia of our bodies horribly offen|&s;ive. Tho&s;e on the floor were incommoded by the &s;aliva and urine of tho&s;e above, who were often &s;o faint with the heat and &s;tench of tho&s;e that lay below, that they could not move even for the homelie&s;t occa&s;ions; and, to add to the&s;e troubles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were the soldiers of the Loyal Clares, who laid hold of the situations next the hatchway: the other prisoners, therefore, relin|quished their claim, not caring to contend with men who each com|manded and maintained a legion.</NOTE> the Iri&s;h &s;oldiers gave them&s;elves up to dirt and idlene&s;s in &s;uch a manner, that as it was totally impo&s;&s;ible to crawl in or out of our dungeon without touching &s;ome of their hammoes with our backs, we were &s;ure to find vermin upon our clothes on coming upon deck in the morning.</P>
<P>As the heat and &s;tench increa&s;ed, many fainted, &s;ome broke out into raving madne&s;s, uttering the mo&s;t incoherent and horrid impre|cations; and we had the affliction, more than once, to &s;ee an unfortunate fellow-&s;ufferer, on the fir&s;t moment of his expo&s;ure to the cold air of the morning, drop down on the deck to ri&s;e no more.</P>
<P>It was in vain that the captain of the &s;hip, a humane and good man, endeavoured to re|lieve our &s;ufferings and check abu&s;es. He gave orders that the hatches &s;hould be left open at nights, and that his &s;urgeon &s;hould look after the &s;ick; but as he had little compul&s;ive power, no &s;ooner was he gone to bed than &s;ome one or other, in &s;pite, as they &s;aid, to
<PB N="6" REF="13">George and Pitt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When we consider the very <HI>re&s;tutable</HI> business of the forged as|signats, the war of La Vendee, and other similar great exploits, we cannot be surprised at the detestation in which the English are held by the French. Wars have ever been carried on with blood, rapine, and plunder, but forgery is certainly a modern improvement; nor need we wonder that our enemies should alike detest that Government which they supposed to have planned, and that People which they knew to have put in practice such a base and cowardly species of warfare. It was however hard, that the weight of their resentment should fall on men who detested such practices as much as themselves.</NOTE>, laid the hatches down; the &s;urgeon of the &s;hip too was &s;o ignorant, that after one of the &s;ick had applied to be &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, he confidently a&s;&s;erted, that nothing ailed him; in le&s;s than an hour, how|ever, this poor fellow contradicted his a&s;&s;ertion by dying upon deck.</P>
<P>On the 2d and 3d of March, we were re|moved from this di&s;mal place and put on board &s;ome Engli&s;h cartels that had arrived from the We&s;t India I&s;lands with pri&s;oners, and had been detained &s;ince the preceding &s;ummer in Lan|derneau road.</P>
<P>Here our condition was much mended; but &s;everal met with a great mortification, for they now perceived that their trunks, &amp;c. had been privately broke open during their abode in the di&s;mal man&s;ions of the Elizabeth, and many articles of value &s;tolen out; among the re&s;t, I thinking, upon my arrival on board one of the&s;e cartels, to regale my&s;elf with a clean &s;hirt, di&s;|covered on looking that it was out of my power, they having been all &s;tolen.</P>
<P>Our allowance of provi&s;ions &s;till continued the &s;ame, but tho&s;e who fortunately had &s;aved a little money, or goods that were &s;aleable, had an opportunity of purcha&s;ing provi&s;ions of all kinds, which the French &s;oldiers brought, partly by &s;tealth, from Bre&s;t and Landerneau. After we had been here about a month, fre&s;h beef was
<PB N="7" REF="14">&s;erved out to the pri&s;oners; but, from what cau&s;e I know not, this allowance was &s;oon di&s;|continued; and, to our mortification, bread likewi&s;e became &s;o &s;carce and bad, that &s;ick|ne&s;s and famine &s;eemed to unite for the de&s;|truction of tho&s;e who were obliged to live upon &s;uch mi&s;erable fare.</P>
<P>The poor fellows, who were our guards, were, however, in the &s;ame condition, nor had either more or better provi&s;ions than the pri&s;oners; and the paper-money was &s;o depreciated, that a merry old Frenchman &s;wore heartily to me that his pay would not find in him &s;nuff; yet the laugh and the dance, and the &s;ong, conti|nued their u&s;ual round among the&s;e inflexible republicans.</P>
<P>As the fre&s;h beef could be no longer procured the commandant, Captain Forterie, u&s;ed to &s;end his boat every Saturday to Landerneau, to pur|cha&s;e provi&s;ions for &s;uch as could pay the market price for them; this (which the butcher's bill regularly brought with them, always made known) was eight livres ten &s;ous a pound for mutton, and &s;ix livres ten &s;ous for veal; but if we recollect, that from one thou&s;and to one thou&s;and four hundred livres were then the price of the louis d'or, or guinea, we mu&s;t re|duce the pound of mutton to two pence, and that of veal to one penny halfpenny.</P>
<P>It was on our arrival in Landerneau river that my attendance on the &s;ick commenced; a very laborious ta&s;k, and replete with ince&s;&s;ant vexation. We had no medicines but &s;uch as had been put on board the &s;hips before their leaving England, for the u&s;e of their re&s;pective crews. The&s;e, originally of an inferior quality, and many of them compounded without &s;kill,
<PB N="8" REF="15">had been much damaged by length of time: nor was there a po&s;&s;ibility of procuring proper diet for the &s;ick. The commandant's &s;urgeon u&s;ed, indeed, to come pretty often to &s;end &s;uch as he thought fit to the ho&s;pitals; but the&s;e were &s;o crouded that none could po&s;&s;ibly be ad|mitted except they were very ill,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How many died is impossible for me to ascertain, many remained in the hospitals after they were cured, many ran away, and several were sent to other prisons.</NOTE> and &s;o very few returned of tho&s;e that went that others were unwilling to go; not to mention that &s;everal mu&s;t have peri&s;hed unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be procured more &s;peedily than their turn of ad|mittance came on.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t part of the &s;pring the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t common were fevers, in which there was little remarkable, except the early attack of de|lirium; which in &s;ome ca&s;es preceded every other &s;ymptom. The patients complained of pains in the head and back, &s;ickne&s;s and vomit|ing; mo&s;t commonly of diarrhoea, but &s;ome|times ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, with which they had for the mo&s;t part been troubled &s;ome days previous to the coming on of more urgent &s;ymptoms. The pul&s;e was low and generally about 110, but &s;ometimes during the fir&s;t day or two very little accelerated or different from the healthy &s;tate; the tongue was u&s;ually white and foul, but &s;ometimes very clean, and the patients generally complained of a bitter ta&s;te in the mouth, together with vertiginous affec|tions of the head.</P>
<P>The plan of cure was obvious; for, after clearing the &s;tomach by a gentle emetic, the &s;timulant plan, with acidulated drinks, com|pleted the cure, without failing even in one
<PB N="9" REF="16">in&s;tance. Bli&s;ters however availed nothing in removing the delirium, which yielded only to free do&s;es of opium.</P>
<P>About the middle of April the &s;curvy made its appearance, and &s;oon &s;pread to an alarming de|gree, without any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;topping its pro|gre&s;s. The &s;hips were, indeed, &s;moaked with gunpowder and vinegar, cleanline&s;s was endea|voured to be enforced, and vinegar was &s;erved out to &s;uch as cho&s;e to apply for it; but all in vain.</P>
<P>The &s;everely cold and damp weather chilled and benumbed a number of poor wretches, half|naked and half-&s;tarved, who, to avoid its incle|mency, could neither be prevailed upon to come upon deck, nor wa&s;h their apartments. Nor was this all, for the crowd and dirt cau&s;ed them to be overrun with vermin, in &s;uch a manner that it was a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s to go among them, even for the few moments nece&s;|&s;ary to render them what little a&s;&s;i&s;tance lay in my power.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy, in the mean time, was daily extending its ravages: &s;carce a day occurred but one or more were added to the number of the &s;ick; nor did a week pa&s;s in which ten at lea&s;t were not &s;ent to the ho&s;pitals of Bre&s;t or Landerneau; in&s;omuch, that by the middle of May, not more than one-third of the original complement remained.</P>
<P>It was perhaps unfortunate that mo&s;t of the &s;hips, being lately arrived from the We&s;t India I&s;lands, had rum on board, The &s;everal captains were willing to accommodate the pri&s;oners with this, which indeed was a great refre&s;hment when temperately u&s;ed; but &s;ome &s;ailors, having got
<PB N="10" REF="17">them&s;elves intoxicated, broke open the holds of the &s;hips and plundered every thing they cho&s;e.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s was carried on with &s;urpri&s;ing regularity, being put in practice on board all the &s;hips at the &s;ame hour; and, &s;hame to tell! was encouraged by &s;ome who&s;e &s;ituations ought to have induced them to &s;et a far different exam|ple. This increa&s;ed the &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ome were even &s;aid to have died under intoxication.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of May I was removed, by the commandant's order, at the de&s;ire of the three captains below, from the &s;hip in which I originally was, to the Humphreys, as a mark of re&s;pect, that being the plea&s;ante&s;t &s;ituation; and as from that time &s;ome degree of intimacy commenced between the commandant and my&s;elf, it then lay in my power to render more &s;ervice than for|merly; I therefore declined the offer of going upon parole, re&s;olving to abide by my country|men in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in preference to con&s;ulting my own ea&s;e or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is with infinite plea&s;ure I write the names of Captain Anthony Collins, of the Humphreys; Captain Wm. Yellowley, of the Re&s;olution; and Captain Rob. Alexander, of the Berwick, three men to whom the thanks of their country are ju&s;tly due, for the pre&s;ervation of many valuable lives. The three &s;hips to which they belonged were moved clo&s;e together in one tier, and as the greate&s;t harmony and friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among them, they united their endeavours to relieve the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e on board their ve&s;&s;els. With this view they di&s;tributed among the pri|&s;oners, at their own ri&s;que, &s;uch &s;tores as were on board of bread, peas, oatmeal, beef, &amp;c. in a regular manner. To the &s;ick they gave tea,
<PB N="11" REF="18">&s;ugar, and other accommodations, bought at their own expence; and tho&s;e ma&s;ters of &s;hips and pa&s;&s;engers, with whom they had any ac|quaintance, or who &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s any merit, they entertained at their own tables. The&s;e la&s;t amounted to ten in number, and we contrived to make our &s;ituation at lea&s;t tolerable. The &s;tock of medicines was now made common, and the direction of it was my province.</P>
<P>The work of humanity went on from this time more cheerfully: the &s;corbutic was &s;ent off more frequently to the ho&s;pitals; for our three marine philanthropi&s;ts were &s;o much re&s;pected by the French, as well as the Engli&s;h, that whatever they reque&s;ted was immediately granted.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that were &s;ick of other di&s;ea&s;es generally remained with us, except they were de&s;titute of clothing, in which ca&s;e they were recommended immediately, on the attack of any &s;erious illne&s;s whatever, to go to the ho&s;pitals. Though the French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It consists chiefly in administering decoctions of simples and ptisans of different sorts. They are mighty friends to phlebotomy, blisters, and clysters; nor do they scruple to use very rough emetics. But in general their prescriptions are very inert; for instance, &rx; pulv. cort. Peruv. pulv. rhabarb &amp; pulv. sal. nit. aa. gr. x. to be given every third hour. Nor do they scruple to wake a patient in the night to give him his dose.</NOTE> medical practice is certainly much in|ferior to the Briti&s;h, the advantages of proper diet, comfortable accommodations, and clean clothes (all which they had at the ho&s;pitals), perhaps more than counterbalanced that infe|riority: at all events it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to effect a cure where all the&s;e were wanting.</P>
<P>But though this imperfect practice promi&s;ed not much to other patients, the &s;corbutic very con&s;tantly found relief from the diet; and tho&s;e from Landerneau pretty generally returned to
<PB N="12" REF="19">us; tho&s;e &s;ent to Bre&s;t frequently were put into the ca&s;tle there; but the&s;e in either ho&s;pital &s;eldom were in any hurry to return.</P>
<P>About the beginning of June the fevers began to a&s;&s;ume a different and more dangerous form. The &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting no longer yielded to emetics; the tongue was foul, blacki&s;h, or a deep yellow; the pul&s;e generally, as in the former fevers, only lower; but the delirium was, if po&s;&s;ible, more early in its attack, and remarkably ob&s;tinate. On the third, fourth, or fifth day, a con&s;iderable degree of icterus came on, often followed by a diarrhoea, which removed the other &s;ymptoms. This was the milde&s;t and mo&s;t favourable form; for many times the vo|miting would only &s;top with the eruption of &s;weat; profu&s;e haemorrhages exhau&s;ted the pa|tient's &s;trength, without in the lea&s;t relieving any of the &s;ymptoms; the icteric &s;ymptoms came on with much pain in the region of the liver; and, the flux, by its profu&s;ion and ob&s;ti|nacy, threatened the wor&s;t con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It was here evident that the former plan of cure mu&s;t be changed, in part at lea&s;t. The vomiting and &s;ickne&s;s could only proceed from one of two cau&s;es, BILE, or that general dia|the&s;is which frequently prevails in contagious and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, and which only cea&s;es with the appearance of &s;weat, &s;ome pu&s;tular eruption, or glandular &s;welling; for putrid &s;or|des, though frequently the occa&s;ion of very trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms in the more advanced &s;tate of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, rarely, if ever, exi&s;t at their commencement.</P>
<P>When, therefore bile was &s;u&s;pected for the cau&s;e, the vitriolic acid was naturally pointed out as the obvious remedy; otherwi&s;e a combi|nation
<PB N="13" REF="20">of opium and antimonials, or opium alone, was u&s;ed to promote a free diaphore&s;is.</P>
<P>When the vomiting was checked, if the pul&s;e was tolerably &s;trong, and not much delirium pre&s;ent, as was u&s;ually the ca&s;e when bile abounded, a gentle purgative was next admi|ni&s;tered, which frequently completed the cure without needing a repetition.</P>
<P>In the other ca&s;es, after &s;weat has been ex|cited, the icteric &s;ymptoms coming gently on, were, for the mo&s;t part, a &s;ign that the wor&s;t was over: and if the diarrhoea came on with moderation, I u&s;ually &s;uffered it to proceed. Many ca&s;es however occurred which required the utmo&s;t attention and exertion.</P>
<P>Delirium and haemorrhage were the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms I had to encounter. The cortex<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This might be owing to the bad quality of that we had.</NOTE> peruvianus availed nothing, nor were bli&s;ters of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ervice; but, happily, the opium an&s;wered both the&s;e ends. If liberally given it procured &s;leep, and removed the deli|rium: and in ca&s;e of &s;udden haemorrhage (no unfrequent occurrence) it was my cu&s;tom to give Tinct. opii gtts L. or gr. iij of the Extract, which u&s;ually &s;topped the bleeding in a few minutes.</P>
<P>Very trouble&s;ome fluxes were &s;ometimes the con&s;equence of the &s;pontaneous diarrhoea, or even of a &s;ingle do&s;e of rhubarb, given during the icteric &s;tage; but the&s;e were when nece&s;&s;ary checked with great certainty and &s;a&s;ety by the opiate.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, aided by the generous and humane exertions of Captains Collins, Alexander and Yellowley, I was fortunate enough to lo&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="21">only one patient in, I may &s;afely &s;ay, near an hundred; whereas of tho&s;e that went for the&s;e complaints to the ho&s;pitals, where they were treated on a very oppo&s;ite plan of cure, not one tenth returned.</P>
<P>I had never, during all this time, attempted even to palliate a &s;corbutic complaint, con&s;cious that nothing effectual could be done without &s;uch a change of diet as was impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ick to procure. But, about the middle of July, we were flattered with the hopes of a &s;peedy exchange, and our numbers were then reduced by death and &s;ickne&s;s (notwith&s;tanding two drafts from the ca&s;tle at Bre&s;t) to little more than three hundred. It then became impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the entreaties of a number of mi&s;erable men, all anxious to revi&s;it their native &s;oil. Terrified at the idea of being left behind in an ho&s;pital, from whence but few had returned, they were de&s;irous, however &s;ick, to undergo every hard&s;hip rather than remain longer where they were; I therefore began, though with little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, to con&s;ider of the means probable to <HI>relieve</HI> tho&s;e whom I was convinced it was impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>cure.</HI></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my reflections on this &s;ubject, I found rea&s;on to di&s;&s;ent from many received opinions; and, by comparing what I had read with what I then &s;aw, endeavoured to acquire more ju&s;t ideas on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy has generally been repre&s;ented as the offspring of cold, of &s;alt provi&s;ions, and of dirt; it has even been repre&s;ented as infec|tious, and capable of being communicated like common contagious complaints, by a &s;hort abode among the &s;ick. But though the circum&s;tances
<PB N="15" REF="22">of cold, &s;alt provi&s;ions, and diet, certainly con|tribute much to its formation, they are, in my opinion, by no means its principal cau&s;e, nor could I trace, in any in&s;tance, the &s;malle&s;t &s;ymp|toms of infection.</P>
<P>That &s;alt provi&s;ions are by no means its &s;ole cau&s;e, is plain from the hi&s;tory given us by Dr. Milmann of two women who had contracted the &s;curvy in a very &s;evere degree, though their diet con&s;i&s;ted entirely of bread and tea; nor was dirt (in that ca&s;e) the cau&s;e, for the&s;e two poor women were <HI>remarkably cleanly.</HI></P>
<P>The man, who&s;e ca&s;e is de&s;cribed by Dr. Huxham as having taken the horrid re&s;olution of &s;tarving him&s;elf, died with as many &s;corbutic &s;ymptoms upon him as &s;o &s;hort a time could be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce. The other per&s;on men|tioned by him, as having de&s;troyed his health by eating immen&s;e quantities of concrete vola|tile alkali, comes nearer to the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being produced by &s;alt. But here it mu&s;t be remarked, that a total lo&s;s of appetite accom|panied the whole di&s;ea&s;e, from whence we are fairly entitled to draw the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, as well as from the following facts.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who, by habits of intemperance, have lo&s;t their appetites, often exhibit appearances exactly re&s;embling the &s;ea-&s;curvy. Every per|&s;on in the lea&s;t conver&s;ant with the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t have &s;een it frequently attack tho&s;e in a conva|le&s;cent &s;tate from other complaints; and we know the African &s;laves are extremely liable to it, though their diet is almo&s;t entirely vegetable.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;es of the two women, there was cer|tainly no cau&s;e but defect of nutriment; the &s;ame was al&s;o evidently true of the man that
<PB N="16" REF="23">&s;tarved him&s;elf; and as we know that vegetable diet will but poorly &s;upport tho&s;e accu&s;tomed to animal food, the &s;ame rea&s;oning may probably apply to the negroes. It may, however, be ob|jected, that the labourers in many places live chiefly on meal, and that they exhibit no &s;cor|butic complaints; but it &s;hould be remembered, that they make up by quantity for the defect of the quality. Tho&s;e who by intemperance lo&s;e their appetites, and con&s;equently impair the dige&s;tive powers, certainly mu&s;t be in the &s;ame predicament of defective nutrition; nor is the &s;curvy often found even among tho&s;e obliged to live on &s;alt provi&s;ions, unle&s;s they are deficient in quantity.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, upon their recovery from other di&s;ea&s;es, are attacked by the &s;curvy, do not im|mediately, on the turn of their former maladies, perceive its approach. For a few days their convale&s;cence goes on as u&s;ual; but, in a week's time, or perhaps near a fortnight, they begin to complain of pains in the limbs, and other &s;cor|butic &s;ymptoms. This, as well as the other ca&s;es, &s;eems plainly to refer to the head of inanition; for we all know that convale&s;cents require not only <HI>more</HI> but <HI>better</HI> nutriment than tho&s;e who have not been &s;ick.</P>
<P>It was before ob&s;erved, that nothing occurred that could countenance the idea of infection, nor can I by any means &s;ub&s;cribe to that opinion, however re&s;pectable the authority of its main|tainers. If by an infectious di&s;ea&s;e, we mean one capable of being communicated by contact, of an infected per&s;on or thing, or a &s;hort abode among the &s;ick, or in infected places, &s;curvy can hardly be referred in the cla&s;s of infectious
<PB N="17" REF="24">di&s;ea&s;es. This opinion has, if I mi&s;take not, been chiefly founded on ob&s;ervations made upon the coa&s;t of Africa, where it was frequently found that the &s;laves were &s;eized with &s;curvy in a few days after they arrived on board the &s;hips. I have, however, been informed by &s;e|veral gentlemen, who, though not of the faculty, are every way qualified for making ob&s;ervations, that tho&s;e who are &s;o early attacked are &s;uch as have been previou&s;ly debilitated by di&s;ea&s;e or hunger; for the men, or rather brutes, that bring the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures to the &s;hips, are often under the nece&s;&s;ity of marching them through the woods for many hundred miles, by which means they frequently catch violent fluxes, and are always liable to great fatigue and hunger.</P>
<P>If, indeed, the &s;curvy were at all infectious, the marine ho&s;pitals would be continually full of &s;corbutic patients, and tho&s;e that went thither to be cured of any other &s;light di&s;ea&s;e, would be almo&s;t &s;ure of contracting a wor&s;e. But we find the ca&s;e very different; nor do the healthy ex|perience the &s;malle&s;t detriment from admitting the &s;corbutic among them. We need not how|ever much wonder that the &s;curvy has been &s;tyled infectious, when the gout it&s;elf has more than once undergone the &s;ame &s;lander.</P>
<P>That the &s;curvy is neither the peculiar pro|duction of heat nor cold is plain, from its being alike to be found in the hotte&s;t and colde&s;t re|gions; but there can be no doubt that either, if carried to a debilitating degree, will a&s;&s;i&s;t much in its formation.</P>
<P>It does not then appear that there is any one circum&s;tance in which all the ca&s;es of &s;curvy agree, except that &s;ingle one of defective nutri|tion,
<PB N="18" REF="25">which we may therefore lay down as the remote cau&s;e of the whole di&s;ea&s;e; though other adventitious circum&s;tances certainly tend very much to influence its particular forms. I can|not think with Dr. Trotter, that the cau&s;e of &s;curvy lies in any peculiar &s;tate of the blood; for though &s;uch a &s;tate accompanies it, I &s;ee no rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the cau&s;e, as it may equally well be the effect.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that it has been known to appear contrary to my &s;uppo&s;ition among tho&s;e who had plenty, and who <HI>might</HI> have at lea&s;t eaten as much as they plea&s;ed. I mu&s;t own I doubt the fact: but grant it true, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, on the other hand, that &s;alt provi|&s;ions are by no means &s;o nutritive as a much le&s;s quantity of fre&s;h. If eaten without &s;teeping the exce&s;&s;ive &s;altne&s;s renders them almo&s;t into|lerable, and if too long &s;teeped (as is generally the ca&s;e) they become almo&s;t a mere <HI>caput mortuum.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the very pains which are taken to ren|der the provi&s;ions <HI>fre&s;h,</HI> &s;erve perhaps more than any indige&s;tible property of the food it&s;elf to prejudice the health. This I very &s;en&s;ibly felt; for, being obliged to live for &s;everal days on provi&s;ions &s;o treated, I found them deprived of all their juices, and reduced by a very moderate boiling, to an almo&s;t in&s;ipid <HI>bouill&eacute;,</HI> which retain|ed &s;earcely any ta&s;te except a faint ru&s;ty one. The older the provi&s;ions are, the more readily they thus part with their mo&s;t nutritive parts; which may be another rea&s;on why &s;curvy more frequently appears on board merchant &s;hips, who&s;e provi&s;ions are often old, than &s;hips of war.</P>
<P>There is, be&s;ides, a certain natural propen&s;ity in the human frame to a variety of food: any
<PB N="19" REF="26">one kind &s;oon cloys; and if once the quality becomes thoroughly di&s;agreeable, the &s;tomach will not, without loathing, receive it in any con&s;iderable quantity. Vegetables, either fre&s;h or dried, as they require &s;alt to render them palatable, very much di&s;po&s;e the &s;tomach to receive &s;alted food; and though they afford but little nutriment them&s;elves, yet by qualify|ing the di&s;agreeable flavour of that which is more nutritious, render e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice.</P>
<P>How much difference the quantity as well as the quality of the food makes, was fully demon|&s;trated to me, by the &s;triking example before my eyes; for the &s;ailors belonging to the cartels, who had plenty of &s;alt provi&s;ions (with now and then a meal of fre&s;h) were very little &s;ubject to the &s;curvy, unle&s;s debilitated by previous di&s;ea&s;e; whereas the pri&s;oners, who&s;e food was as mi&s;er|ably deficient in quantity as in every other re&s;pect, were daily falling victims to it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es it was rea&s;onable for me to conclude, that the only radical cure for the &s;curvy was to be obtained not from medicine but from change of diet; yet that &s;ome pallia|tion might be expected from tho&s;e means that could be u&s;ed to increa&s;e the appetite, joined with &s;uch as give what may be called artificial &s;trength. Such are the &s;everal acids, bark, opium, wine, and &s;trong liquors, taken in mo|deration; but none of the&s;e could be &s;uppo&s;ed to do more than relieve for a few days.</P>
<P>Before I had perfectly &s;atisfied my own mind on the &s;ubject, an event, le&s;s the effect of de&s;ign than of accident, convinced me that I was not totally wrong. An old man having &s;uffered in|tolerable pain, and lo&s;t the u&s;e of his legs by the
<PB N="20" REF="27">&s;curvy, took at night a pill of extract. opii, to alleviate his torment. He was &s;o much relieved in his complaints, by this &s;ingle do&s;e, that I gave him a few &s;mall pills, with directions to take one three or four times a day: to my great, and very plea&s;ing &s;urprize, not only his pains le&s;t him, but the &s;tiffne&s;s of his joints likewi&s;e; the blackne&s;s which had almo&s;t completely &s;urround|ed the knee, in a great mea&s;ure di&s;appeared; nor did I find any difficulty in keeping him &s;uf|ficiently well, to remain on board, till we &s;ailed for England.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, I pro|ceeded to extend the &s;ame practice to others in different &s;tates of the di&s;ea&s;e, till I a&s;certained the important fact, that opium, prudently admini|&s;tered, is capable of palliating, for <HI>many days,</HI> the mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms of &s;ea &s;curvy, at lea&s;t in its incipient &s;tate; and thus enabling the poor &s;uf|ferers to hold out till perhaps &s;ome ho&s;pitable &s;hore may afford the only radical cure&mdash;dry air, moderate exerci&s;e, and plentiful diet.</P>
<P>It now remains for me to lay down a few prac|tical rules for the general management of &s;cor|butic complaints, as well in the curative as pre|ventive intention; as likewi&s;e &s;ome hints that may facilitate the admini&s;tration of opium in tho&s;e ca&s;es where its effects are deficient or exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The prevention of &s;curvy is not attended with any remarkable difficulty. Every ob&s;tacle has been nearly removed by the illu&s;trious Captain Cook, who&s;e plans are now pretty exactly fol|lowed in the Briti&s;h navy.</P>
<P>Nearly the &s;ame method might be adopted on board every &s;hip bound on a long voyage, were not ob&s;tinate bigotry to old cu&s;toms a too
<PB N="21" REF="28">prominent feature in the character of mo&s;t na|vigators. Captain Cook's fir&s;t improvement was to divide his &s;hip's company into three watches in&s;tead of two, a practice which might be more frequently imitated than it is. It does not very often happen that the whole watch (when the crew is formed into two watches only) is wanted on deck at the &s;ame time; it would certainly then be better to le&s;&s;en their fatigue, by dividing them into three, &s;o as to allow one-third to have eight hours uninterrupt|ed re&s;t each night. This would allow &s;ufficient time to wear off the effects of bad and rainy weather, and to refre&s;h completely tho&s;e that have been hara&s;&s;ed with labour. Two-thirds might often &s;erve, when, according to the pre|&s;ent cu&s;tom, all hands are called; and when that is practicable, the advantage of having a reinforce|ment of fre&s;h hands every eighth hour is too obvious to be overlooked.</P>
<P>Next to providing again&s;t over-fatigue, dry and &s;ufficient clothing &s;hould be attended to. This, though effectually done on board &s;hips of war, is too little attended to on board merchant &s;hips. The &s;ailors them&s;elves are certainly of all men the lea&s;t proper to be tru&s;ted with lay|ing in their own nece&s;&s;aries. Few of them have the fortitude to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of a gla&s;s of gin or a &s;trumpet; and, to indulge them&s;elves in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, they will, without &s;cruple, expend their la&s;t farthing, and go to &s;ea in the mo&s;t deplorable condition.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter, therefore, who wi&s;hes to conduct his &s;hip through a long voyage in &s;afety, will always take care to have on board a &s;ufficient &s;tock of nece&s;&s;ary clothing, to &s;upply tho&s;e who
<PB N="22" REF="29">are to make the voyage, and may have come out in want. It would not, for obvious rea&s;ons, be prudent for him to advance too much before their leaving port, but at &s;ea a mutual power ought to exi&s;t for him to be enabled to compel the men to have nece&s;&s;ary clothes, and for them to demand to be &s;o &s;upplied by him, to be ac|counted for out of their wages, at a fair price.</P>
<P>The article of provi&s;ions is of the greate&s;t im|portance; but in this little choice can be had after the fre&s;h &s;tock has been expended. Some means may perhaps be di&s;covered of pre&s;erving animal &s;ub&s;tances at a moderate expence, without &s;alt, or at lea&s;t with a &s;maller quantity than is commonly employed for that purpo&s;e: at all events, a di&s;covery &s;o very important and &s;alutary, is highly worthy the labours of the philo&s;opher, and ought, in a commercial coun|try, to be encouraged by a mo&s;t ample reward.</P>
<P>However, as this de&s;irable di&s;covery has not yet been made, all that can now be done is to modify and correct the ordinary &s;alt provi&s;ions, as to render them as little noxious as po&s;&s;ible. Too much &s;teeping, as was before ob&s;erved, ex|hau&s;ts the nutritious parts of the &s;alted beef or pork, which &s;eems to be chemically combined with the &s;alt. Moderate wa&s;hing is quite ne|ce&s;&s;ary to remove that &s;uperfluity of &s;alt which would otherwi&s;e render the meat too acrid to be eaten; but beyond certain limits it is certainly detrimental. If pea&s;e, beans, callivances, or other farinacea, are eaten along with the &s;alt provi&s;ion, thus treated they will not only render it much more palatable, but (as they them&s;elves contain no very de&s;picable &s;hare of nutriment) contribute much to the pre&s;ervation of health.
<PB N="23" REF="30">This can however only be &s;aid of them in a &s;ound and perfect &s;tate; for, when &s;poiled with long keeping, or full of vermin, they become totally u&s;ele&s;s and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Bi&s;cuit for long voyages cannot be kept too clo&s;ely headed up in ca&s;ks. Many per&s;ons are of opinion, that it requires now and then to be opened and aired; but experience, as well as rea|&s;on, prove the contrary; for I have &s;een bi&s;cuit which has been kept, with no other precaution than that of being put into a tight ca&s;k, more than three years, perfectly fre&s;h and plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Vegetables are, doubtle&s;s, of con&s;iderable u&s;e in combination with other food, and in the inten|tion of rendering it more palatable may be u&s;ed fre&s;h or pickled; but if u&s;ed alone they are neither able to check nor prevent the &s;curvy. I have ever &s;een them hurtful when eaten too freely or raw. It has been lately imagined by &s;ome of our navigators, that potatoes eaten raw are a &s;pecific in this di&s;ea&s;e; but ocular demon&s;tration has convinced me that this nau&s;eous do&s;e pro|duces little or no effect. The &s;ame I can affirm of cabbages, with this addition, that &s;everal were taken ill in con&s;equence of not being able to dige&s;t the&s;e vegetables when too plentifully u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The juices of ace&s;cent vegetables, infu&s;ions of malt, vinegar, &amp;c. po&s;&s;e&s;s in them&s;elves no anti&s;corbutic powers; but by whetting the ap|petite and a&s;&s;uaging thir&s;t, they facilitate the reception and dige&s;tion of &s;alt food. Were it otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould find that a little vinegar or lemon juice would cure the di&s;ea&s;e at &s;ea; but the miracles &s;aid to be wrought by vege|tables
<PB N="24" REF="31">have in general been performed on &s;hore, where fre&s;h meat is likewi&s;e to be had, with tho additional luxury of a pure and dry air.</P>
<P>It has often been matter of &s;urprize to me, that dried and &s;moked meats &s;o &s;eldom enter into the lift of &s;hips' provi&s;ions. Prepared in this manner, though they are much inferior in nutrition and &s;alubrity to fre&s;h, they are much &s;uperior in both the&s;e re&s;pects to the ordinary &s;alt beef and pork. It &s;eems, indeed, notwith|&s;tanding this inferiority, if we may tru&s;t to the numerous in&s;tances of the inhabitants of the north, who&s;e diet is almo&s;t &s;olely compo&s;ed of the&s;e dried meats and oatmeal, that, aided by the ordinary &s;tores of meal, pea&s;e, &amp;c. they would hardly, if at all, produce the &s;curvy among &s;ailors. The great difference between dried and pickled meat is farther obvious, if we reflect, that in the one the nutritious juices are but lightly impregnated with &s;alt, and dried, as it were, into a &s;irm glutinous ma&s;s of ea&s;y &s;olu|tion; but, in the other, they are in one of two &s;tates, either kept con&s;tantly in a &s;tate of &s;olu|tion by the &s;urrounding pickle, or el&s;e &s;o &s;ixed by the &s;ait as not to yield to an aqueous men&s;truum. But the exce&s;&s;ive in&s;ipidity of pickled beef, fre&s;h|ened by long &s;teeping, plainly &s;hews that the juices are by no means fixed: on the contrary, they are di&s;po&s;ed to ea&s;y &s;olution, and ready to be wa&s;hed away along with the &s;alt that pre&s;erves them from putrefaction.</P>
<P>The catching of fi&s;h is always encouraged, as it furni&s;hes many a fre&s;h meal when no other can be had. The larger and &s;tronger ta&s;ted ought to be boiled rather than fried, and always u&s;ed when quite fre&s;h; fortunately when fi&s;h can
<PB N="25" REF="32">be caught, there are few &s;orts which a little oil and lemon juice, or vinegar, will not render very tolerable.</P>
<P>While the beer la&s;ts, not only the &s;curvy, but other di&s;ea&s;es are generally very rare; but when that is con&s;umed the men often begin to grow &s;ickly. The water &s;oon becoming putrid and di&s;gu&s;ting, the &s;ailors ab&s;tain as much as po&s;&s;ible from it, nor will they, unle&s;s compelled, mix their allowance of wine or &s;pirits with it, but prefer drinking each &s;eparate. In proportion to their &s;tomachs becoming palled with their pro|vi&s;ions, their appetites and dige&s;tions fail, and the obvious con&s;equence, inanition, takes place. They are directed, by a kind of in&s;tinct, to &s;up|port a &s;ort of artificial &s;trength with their allow|ance of wine and &s;pirits; the&s;e produce that effect for a &s;hort time, but lo&s;e their efficacy by degrees, till at la&s;t the unhappy mariner falls a victim to the flow, but mercile&s;s di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing contributes more than a cheerful mind and moderate bodily exertion to prevent at|tacks of the &s;curvy, of which I &s;aw &s;ome &s;triking in&s;tances in France. One in particular, a little, lively fellow, who though his fare was no better than his fellow-&s;ufferers, e&s;caped every &s;corbutic taint, which I could attribute to nothing but his activity and good &s;pirits. It has indeed long been remarked, that the &s;kulkers are the fir&s;t &s;uf|ferers: every means therefore &s;hould be u&s;ed to promote cheerfulne&s;s and gentle exerci&s;e, which la&s;t is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the life of a failor is either that of the &s;evere&s;t drudgery or downright indolence.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hing the mouth well in a morning with &s;alt water and vinegar, may, as tending to clean|line&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="33">be productive of &s;ome good; but from this I can entertain little higher expectations than from mo&s;t other popular no&s;trums. If foulne&s;s of the &s;tomach, or ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, create unea&s;ine&s;s, they mu&s;t be immediately remedied; evacuations of all &s;orts mu&s;t however be cauti|ou&s;ly employed, and phlebotomy, after men have been &s;ome time at &s;ea, &s;hould never be performed without the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The whole of the prophylactic plan may be &s;ummed up in a very few GENERAL RULES, of which the <HI>preceding remarks</HI> may &s;erve for an explanation.</P>

</LIST>
<P>The cure of &s;curvy at &s;ea is certainly next to impo&s;&s;ible, nor does the palliation of its mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms appear to me to admit of great variation in the practice. The excellent effects of opium have already been mentioned, but I &s;hall here &s;omewhat enlarge upon that as well as a few other u&s;eful articles of the <HI>materiae medica.</HI></P>
<P>The acids and their effects have been already examined, nor does it &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to add any thing farther on them, except that as condiments
<PB N="27" REF="34">they are both u&s;eful and agreeable. The Peru|vian bark I had but little opportunity to try, nor indeed would any trials made by me have been in the lea&s;t deci&s;ive; as all the bark we had was not only &s;poiled by long keeping, but originally of the wor&s;t quality.</P>
<P>Of all the medicines propo&s;ed for the eure of this complaint, I can find none that has produced any remarkable effects except opium; but as ex|periments of its utility are (&s;o far as I know) in their infancy, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;ubjoin|ing a few hints on its more general u&s;e, &s;incerely wi&s;hing, that others who&s;e opportunities of ren|dering &s;ervice to mankind exceed mine, may find it as &s;ucce&s;sful as I have done.</P>
<P>Among the various officinal forms of this in|comparable article the &s;olid, unprepared, or, as commonly called, <HI>crude opium,</HI> &s;eems the be&s;t cal|culated for u&s;e in &s;corbutic ca&s;es; the tincture, and even the &s;ofter extract, being too &s;udden, violent, and tran&s;itory in their effects. The &s;olid will indeed agree with many per&s;ons who cannot take it in any other form, though &s;ome are &s;aid to be incapable of bearing it in any form whatever. This however (though certain idio&s;yncra&s;ies are beyond explanation) &s;eems in general an ill-founded opinion; and that either the opium has been admini&s;tered when not wanted, or without attending to the &s;tate of the <HI>primae viae.</HI></P>
<P>On this account we mu&s;t con&s;ider what are the &s;tates in which the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages are found, and what are the means indicated by rea&s;on, and confirmed by experience, for the remedying &s;uch as are morbid.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach in a healthy &s;tate neither abounds
<PB N="28" REF="35">in acid, bile, phlegm, nor putrid &s;ordes, but per|forms its offices readily, and with ea&s;e; yet it is liable, more or le&s;s readily, to contract any of the above morbid &s;tates.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tates are commonly the concomitants of certain habits of living. The &s;tomach generally abounds in acidities in the fat and indolent; in bile, in per&s;ons who&s;e exce&s;&s;es in drinking deprive them of appetite, in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to hot climates and &s;ea&s;ons, and in tho&s;e who have endured long anxiety of mind, and in both acid and bilious &s;tate it is likewi&s;e apt to be &s;tuffed with phlegm. All the&s;e conditions of the <HI>primae viae</HI> may, accord|ing to circum&s;tances, be either the cau&s;e or con&s;e|quences of various di&s;ea&s;es; but the putrid, when not owing to putrid inge&s;ta, is, I believe, the &s;ole production of di&s;ea&s;e continued for a length of time. No&s;ologi&s;ts have indeed talked of an al|kaline &s;tate, and have adapted a &s;et of medicines to it under the barbarous name of <HI>Antalkalina;</HI> but &s;uch a &s;tate is not, I believe, very commonly found, at lea&s;t no in&s;tance of it has ever come to my knowledge.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t (the acid) the re&s;ins and gum re&s;ins are nearly in&s;oluble; purgatives of that cla&s;s operate &s;lowly, and with griping; and opium, though given in very large do&s;es, produces but little effect. The corrector for this is obvious, and was proved even to demon&s;tration in the epidemic <HI>diarrhoea</HI> of 1789, which prevailed almo&s;t all through England. Rhubarb even increa&s;ed the di&s;ea&s;e, and opium alone produced little effect, but conjoined with either the fixed, or volatile alkali, magne&s;ia, or even common chalk, operated in the happie&s;t manner.</P>
<P>We may take, as a farther in&s;tance, a di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="36">chiefly incident &s;o old men, which I have twice met with. It is &s;o far, as I know, a nonde&s;cript, and perhaps mi&s;taken for a &s;purious apoplexy; but the perfect &s;imilarity of the two ca&s;es, as well as their cure, &s;hew that neither was &s;in|gular.</P>
<P>"I was &s;ent for to an old farmer, who was &s;aid to have been &s;eized with a fit, and found him lying in a profound &s;leep, with a full &s;low pul&s;e, deep &s;norting, and <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum:</HI> he had been attempted in vain to be let blood in both arms, nor did I entertain the lea&s;t doubt of his ca&s;e being apoplectic.</P>
<P>"In about a quarter of an hour he came &s;ome|what to his &s;en&s;es, and vomited a &s;mall quantity of phlegm, but pre&s;ently his eyes were di&s;torted, his head drawn a&s;ide, he uttered a piercing cry, and in&s;tantly relap&s;ed into the &s;ame &s;tate in which I had found him.</P>
<P>"On inquiry, I found he had complained of pain at the &s;tomach before his fits; and as there was &s;ome mint water at hand, I gave him, as foon as he was able to take it, a &s;mall tea-cup full, with a few drops of tinct. opii. This how|ever he &s;oon rejected, and relap&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as before.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;ing that his complaint might proceed from &s;ome putrid &s;ub&s;tance lodged in the &s;to|mach, I ordered him a draught containing gr. x. of kali ppt. with gtts. xxx. tinct. opii, to be immediately followed by &s;uce. limon &ounce;&s;s. In the hurry of giving it to him the lemon juice was &s;pilt, and before any more could be pro|cured the patient found him&s;elf &s;o much better that he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to take it. Next morning I found him almo&s;t well, his chief com|plaint
<PB N="30" REF="37">being of the &s;orene&s;s of his mouth and throat, which were almo&s;t excoriated by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive acidity of what he had vomited: he &s;aid his whole complaint had lain in his &s;tomach, and that he had found immediate relief upon taking the <HI>(alkaline)</HI> draught.</P>
<P>"He has &s;everal times &s;ince been threatened with &s;imilar attacks, but always repels them by means of a mixture, containing a con&s;iderable portion of the <HI>confectio aromatica &amp; magne&s;ia,</HI> which he keeps con&s;tantly by him."</P>
<P>The other ca&s;e was &s;o &s;trictly &s;imilar, that nothing more need be &s;aid, but that I removed the whole di&s;ea&s;e at once with the following draught:

</LIST></P>
<P>The next &s;tate of the &s;tomach to be con&s;idered is the BILIOUS, in which all the re&s;inous &s;ub|&s;tances operate with remarkable force. The purgatives of this cla&s;s act bri&s;kly and quickly; and opium very often occa&s;ions delirium.</P>
<P>Here the vitriolic acid is indicated both by rea&s;on and experience, for the purpo&s;e of de|compo&s;ing the bile, and removing its hurtful effects. Emetics have, it is true, been the con|&s;tant re&s;ource of phy&s;icians, ever &s;ince the days of Hippocrates; and where the &s;tomach is known to abound in phlegm are certainly proper. But this mode of practice ought to be cautiou&s;ly pur|&s;ued, unle&s;s there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething more than bilious &s;ordes in the &s;to|mach.
<PB N="31" REF="38">In many robu&s;t con&s;titutions unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tomach, vertigo, and bitter, di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in the mouth are removed with great cer|tainty by an emetic; but in tender and weakly per&s;ons the &s;ame &s;ymptoms often require a very different method of cure. After the&s;e feeble patients have taken an emetic, they &s;eem, per|haps for a day or two, to be relieved by it, but are &s;ometimes about that time attacked by a cholera morbus, which proves remarkably &s;evere.</P>
<P>When, therefore, the want of &s;trength gives the lea&s;t ground for &s;u&s;picion, and there is no rea&s;on to believe that the complaint originates from any other cau&s;e than redundant bile, the vitriolic acid taken in &s;mall do&s;es, as occa&s;ion may require, will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In the autumn of 1790, there appeared a bilious diarrhoea, which if not prudently treated, was very apt to run into cholera morbus in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The ordinary a&s;tringents excited vomiting, in proportion as they checked the flux; purga|tives, however gentle, brought on the <HI>cholera,</HI> and opium cau&s;ed delirium; but by premi&s;ing a few drops of acid. vitriol. dilut. any of the&s;e might be admini&s;tered with &s;afety.</P>
<P>Where the primae viae are clogged with phlegm, there is perhaps no way of removing it but by evacuation; nor mu&s;t we be di&s;cou|raged if a do&s;e of extraordinary magnitude &s;hould be required. This tenacious &s;ub&s;tance lines the &s;tomach and alimentary tube in &s;uch a manner as to render them incapable of being acted upon by ordinary do&s;es; at the &s;ame time it ob&s;tructs the orifices of the lacteals; and until
<PB N="32" REF="39">it is cleared away the patient &s;inks under a train of &s;ymptoms, often &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from other cau&s;es. This is no where more &s;trongly exemplified than in the chronie colic; de&s;cribed by Aretaeus. Here it &s;hould &s;eem very bri&s;k purgatives are quite nece&s;&s;ary, as is made to appear by the ca&s;e (the only one I believe on record) publi&s;hed by me in the New London Medical Journal, vol. I. part II.</P>
<P>The putrid &s;tate of the &s;tomach, or lower in|te&s;tines, is ea&s;ily known, and can only be reme|died by the carbonic acid, whether it proceeds from putrid &s;ub&s;tances taken in by the mouth, or from previous general di&s;ea&s;e. Riverius was, I believe, the fir&s;t that applied this acid, in the form of the fermenting mixture, in the putrid vomiting, which takes place in &s;ome fevers; but &s;ince his time, other phy&s;icians have con&s;ider|ably extended its u&s;e, upon rational grounds, with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. When trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms are excited by putrid &s;ub&s;tances re|ceived by the mouth, it is equally efficacious; an in&s;tance of which may be found in the Medical Journal above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Many other medicines have been mentioned as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing high anti&s;eptic. powers, but their effects &s;eem very incon&s;iderable; nor, &s;ince we are provided with one of &s;uch approved efficacy, is it of much con&s;equence whether we have any more.</P>
<P>I have been in&s;en&s;ibly tempted into a long, and, perhaps, unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion; but as the correction of medicines once was a favourite theme in phy&s;ic, and has of late been much ne|glected, I could not forbear giving my &s;enti|ments on a &s;ubject, which, when rationally
<PB N="33" REF="40">attempted, is of more importance than feems at this time commonly imagined. Nor did I think it &s;uperfluous to facilitate as much as lay in my power the u&s;e of one of the mo&s;t active and excel|lent articles of the <HI>materia medica.</HI></P>
<P>When indeed I fir&s;t undertook the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic &s;ome rules, beyond what are commonly taught, &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary for extemporaneous pre|&s;cription. The u&s;e of articles confe&s;&s;edly inert &s;truck me as a criminal &s;pecies of trifling; following implicitly the formulae of others &s;eemed to be treat|ed mildly, by being only called &s;ervile indolence; nor did the u&s;e of di&s;puted medicines, or the ran|dom application of the more active, appear at all warrantable. Be&s;ides, it has frequently happened that one phy&s;ician, guided by experience, has ex|tolled to the &s;kies an article which another, on the very &s;ame ground, has pronounced totally inert. No other rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned for this, (if one or both have not been deceived by u&s;ing it in com|bination with other drugs, on which its power &s;olely depended), but that &s;ome local circum&s;tance has been overlooked. On this account it was obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to inquire into tho&s;e &s;tates of the living &s;y&s;tem which could produce any remark|able difference in the power of medicines, and the above is &s;ome part of the re&s;ult of that inquiry.</P>
<P>But to return to our &s;ubject. Having corrected the &s;tate of the <HI>primae viae,</HI> we may generally pro|ceed to admini&s;ter the opium to our &s;corbutic pa|tients. Sometimes, however ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s renders its immediate u&s;e improper, and this mu&s;t be removed by the u&s;e of gentle cathartics, given in &s;uch do&s;es as are ju&s;t &s;ufficient to produce their proper effects. But though this practice in general is nece&s;&s;ary, it is not always &s;o; for &s;ometimes
<PB N="34" REF="41">the opium, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, produces an evacuation, even when &s;mall do&s;es of carthartics fail; an effect only to be accounted for on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the faeces are retained, becau&s;e the inte&s;tinal tube is too much debilitated to expel them.</P>
<P>The patients mu&s;t be kept dry and warm, but not too hot; nor &s;hould any &s;pecies of cleanline&s;s be omitted. If they can move them&s;elves, they &s;hould be as much as po&s;&s;ible in the open air, when the weather is fine: gentle exertions &s;hould be encouraged; and even tho&s;e who are them&s;elves incapable of motion, will find much refre&s;hment on being carried in their hammocs, or otherwi&s;e, upon deck. All &s;urprizes, and &s;udden emotions and exertions, ought to be carefully avoided, cheer|ful ideas &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed, but even the&s;e &s;hould be of the &s;teady kind; amu&s;ements &s;hould be encouraged, but not laborious ones; and the plea&s;ing hope of reaching land in a few days &s;hould be con&s;tantly in&s;tilled into the mind. Even when that de&s;irable event takes place, it ought to be gradually &s;ignified to the&s;e mi&s;erable objects. The exertions of the mind have much effect on the body nor can I attribute the &s;udden deaths of &s;corbutic patients, on their arrival in port, to any other cau&s;e than exce&s;s of joy. When the body is much de|bilitated, any &s;light exertion, or pa&s;&s;ion, produces very great effects; nor perhaps is a &s;tate of greater debility any where to be found than in this di&s;ea&s;e; for here we often find per&s;ons who the moment before were &s;peaking cheerfully, &s;uddenly expire on attempting to ri&s;e from their beds.</P>
<P>Scorbutic ulcers mu&s;t be kept clean; but whether the practice of dre&s;&s;ing them with vegetable acids is of much avail, experience can alone determine.
<PB N="35" REF="42">In general the fewer applications are made to wounds and ulcers the better; if the dre&s;&s;ings be &s;oft, and &s;ufficient to keep out dirt and cold, little more is required.</P>
<P>The earth-bath has been much commended, both as a topical and general application in &s;corbutic complaints. It is &s;aid to occa&s;ion great pain on being fir&s;t u&s;ed, but in a few repetitions the pains wear off, and the whole habit quickly amends. How far this is the ca&s;e I am unable to determine; but as the earth-bath can only be practi&s;ed on &s;hore, the change of diet which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to obtain at that that time may perhaps effect the cure. The application of the fre&s;h earth may perhaps palliate the &s;ymptoms, but it mu&s;t &s;trike every one as a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity, to imagine that the morbid effects can permanently cea&s;e whil&s;t their cau&s;e (bad and in&s;ufficient food) remains.</P>
<P>If it is nece&s;&s;ary to attempt the palliation of &s;corbutic complaints at &s;ea, the anti&s;corbutic diet, particularly &s;o far as relates to nutriment, mu&s;t be adopted. If &s;uch food cannot be procured, the addition of a little wine to the &s;alt beef, when &s;tewed, will render it more palatable, without de|&s;troying its nutritive powers. The portable &s;oups are highly proper, and may be rendered &s;till more &s;o, by being united with pea&s;e, as it appears from experiment, that fluid food is not &s;o readily acted upon by the &s;tomach as that which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome degree of &s;olidity.</P>
<P>For drink the liquors mu&s;t be &s;uited to the climate. But in all ca&s;es, as the creating of arti|ficial &s;trength is the principal object, wine, punch, or beer, may be taken, as appears mo&s;t &s;uitable. No liquor, perhaps in point of coolne&s;s and bri&s;k|ne&s;s, exceeds &s;pruce-beer, and as the e&s;&s;ence of &s;pruce is perfectly portable, it becomes within the reach of every navigator.</P>

<P>The&s;e rules are likewi&s;e proper to be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence from other di&s;ea&s;es; for &s;uch are (as was before ob&s;erved) very liable to attacks of the &s;curvy, every &s;ymptom of which however after di&s;appears as they regain their &s;trength.</P>
<P>For the u&s;e of &s;uch as are much reduced by acute di&s;ea&s;es, an emul&s;ion may be made as fol|lows; which, if well prepared, can hardly be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from cow's milk, and &s;erves for tea or coffee equally as well:</P>
<P>Grind together in a marble mortar about a drachm of fine loaf sugar, half a drachm of gum-arabic, and half a teaspoonful of common salt: when well powdered and mixed, add from twenty to thirty blanched sweet al|monds; bruise the whole well together, and form them into a paste; to which add by degrees a pint of boiled water. The slower the water is added, and more pains is taken with rubbing them, the better will be the liquor; and when all the water is added, strain through a fine linen cloth.</P>
<P>Upon &s;tanding, it throws up a fine rich cream, which may be collected in &s;uch quantity, if we u&s;e enough of the emul&s;ion, as to become a mo&s;t delicate article of luxury.</P>
<P>If to half a pint of this liquor a little spirits and sugar be added, it forms a grateful and refreshing draught in any climate, hot or cold; nor can it perhaps be paral|leled unless by the luxurious milk of the cocoa nut.</P>
<P>In the mean time small doses of opium; for in&s;tance, pills of grj. Each must be administered at short in|tervals.</P>
<P>A &s;oon as ever the &s;curvy makes its appearance on board a &s;hip, the fir&s;t con&s;ideration ought to be the po&s;&s;ibility of making land in a &s;hort time. It is in vain to flatter our&s;elves that the di&s;ea&s;e may not &s;pread, becau&s;e perhaps only one man is &s;ick.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of this cruel malady once &s;own, they
<PB N="37" REF="44">only wait for a favourable opportunity to pro|duce their horrid fruit. Every little fatigue will be &s;everely felt, and a few, a very few days of bad weather may reduce a numerous crew to the mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;tate; incapable alike to improve a favour|able gale, or to guard again&s;t the perils of a &s;torm. To ve&s;&s;els in this &s;ituation no &s;uch thing &s;hould exi&s;t as an enemy's port. The animo&s;ities of am|bition &s;hould be obliterated by the tears of huma|nity. This has more than once been the ca&s;e, when &s;hips in di&s;tre&s;s have put into the ports of their enemies; they have been relieved and &s;et at liberty, and would always be &s;o was man per|mitted to act for him&s;elf. In few ca&s;es, indeed, will he, if left to his own feelings, do wrong. The &s;acred voice of mi&s;ery will ever be heard with attention; nay, &s;ometimes the hand of wretchedne&s;s, impelled by want, has been held privileged even in violating the fir&s;t rules of mora|lity. The natural di&s;po&s;ition of man is to good|ne&s;s; his heart yearns with benevolence towards his fellow-creatures. Cruelty con&s;titutes no part of his native character; but cu&s;tom and education often &s;orely warp the naturally &s;traight wand. Born with feelings tremblingly alive to every re|pre&s;entation of woe, vicious habits rooted by time too often render him in&s;en&s;ible to the mi&s;eries of others; he can &s;ee them without pity, he can inflict them without remor&s;e: but, permitted to obey the dictates of his own heart, without any vicious precedent to pervert his actions, they are for the mo&s;t part generous, great, and good.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the above went to pre&s;s, it has been &s;ugge&s;ted to me that the fevers attended with icteric &s;ymptoms, p. 12, might po&s;&s;ibly have been brought by the &s;hips from the We&s;t Indies, and communicated by infection to the pri&s;oners who &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ept upon the mattre&s;&s;es the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers had u&s;ed in tho&s;e i&s;lands where the yellow fever raged. That clothes and bedding are capable of retaining and communicating infection, I am far from denying; but I cannot at the &s;ame time allow, that the yellow fever, properly &s;o called, is at all infectious. When that fatal epidemic appeared at Philadelphia, no tolerably atte&s;ted in|&s;tance of contagion is related of it. The weather, during July, Augu&s;t, September, and October, was remarkably hot, calm, and droughty; but about the 8th of November it became colder, and a good deal of rain fell, when the number of deaths im|mediately decrea&s;ed from upwards of two thou|&s;and, who died in October, to about an hundred and twenty. If the yellow fever makes its appear|ance in the We&s;t Indies in war-time, when the ho&s;pitals are crouded with &s;ick, there can be no doubt but that tho&s;e in the ho&s;pitals will be liable to that contagious di&s;ea&s;e which is proper to tho&s;e places; but as all intercurrent di&s;ea&s;es partake of the form of the reigning epidemic, the&s;e will put on the general form of the yellow fever, though of a widely different origin, and that they may be communicated by infection is very evident.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="46">
<P>In all the ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e originating from con|tagion that I have been able to trace, <HI>delirium</HI> is &s;eldom or never an early &s;ymptom: in the wor&s;t ca&s;es of the &s;mall-pox the patient is very rarely delirious for &s;everal days. But when di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from the con&s;titution of the air, the ca&s;e is widely different, and the fir&s;t attack is often di&s;covered by a derangement of intellect. In tho&s;e fatal maladies that attack Europeans who re&s;ide in &s;ome parts of Africa during the rainy &s;ea&s;on, a kind of light delirium often precedes every other &s;ymptom; when the <HI>angina maligna</HI> rages epide|mically this is often the fir&s;t harbinger of the di&s;ea&s;e; when the plague ravaged London in 1665, it &s;eems to have been preceded by an epi|demic delirium, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf among the people by frantic pretences to prophecy and power of &s;eeing &s;pectres; and finally, whil&s;t I was in France, a gentleman, who was not in the way of any infection, was &s;eized with a violent fever, which fir&s;t declared it&s;elf by his being taken de|lirious whil&s;t &s;itting at breakfa&s;t. We may perhaps then make early delirium a criterion of an epide|mic generated upon the &s;pot, and not imported from any foreign climate; nor, in fact, do I believe there ever was an in&s;tance of an epidemic being brought out of one country into another: one or two per&s;ons may certainly be infected by this mode of communication, but to enable the conta|gion to &s;pread to any extent, many other circum|&s;tances mu&s;t concur.</P>

<HEAD>Shortly will be Published, <HI>BY THE SAME AUTHOR, A TRANSLATION OF THE</HI> Genuine Works of Hippocrates, <HI>WITH HIS LIFE;</HI> As collected from the best Authorities.</HEAD>
<P>THIS work has been the labour of &s;everal years, and was originally undertaken &s;olely for the Author's own u&s;e. It was indeed perfectly evident to him on the fir&s;t peru&s;al of the writings of the Venerable Fathers of Medicine, that his Tran&s;|lators and Commentators had in general not only mi&s;conceived his ideas, but even gro&s;sly mi&s;under&s;tood his language. In his Aphori&s;ms the&s;e blunders are often of the fir&s;t magnitude; they not only di&s;tort the Author's meaning, but &s;ometimes entirely do it away, or el&s;e render grand and u&s;eful Theorem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trifling and non&s;en&s;ical. In his other works, which are of a le&s;s didactic ca&s;t, blunders, though not of &s;o great importance, are, neverthele&s;s, unplea&s;ant to the reader. The great u&s;e of a correct Tran&s;lation of an Author, from whom more than half the Medical Writings of the la&s;t two thou&s;and years have been copied, &s;tolen, or perverted, needs no remark: the Author &s;ubmits his performance to the judgment of his brethren, who will, he doubts not, prai&s;e or cen&s;ure him according to his merit.</P>
