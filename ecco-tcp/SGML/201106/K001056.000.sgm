<P>BEING convinced from de|liberate reflections, that the imagination of pregnant women, can make no impre&s;&s;ion on the form of the foetus: and, being witne&s;s to

<P>As it is a &s;ubject, under &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances, of very great importance to the fair &s;ex, I am induced to ad|dre&s;s my&s;elf to them in particular; in hopes &s;uch addre&s;s may engage an attentive peru&s;al; from whence, I flatter my&s;elf, I &s;hall be the means of alleviating tho&s;e anxious fears rai&s;ed by prejudice, and but too ge|nerally attendant on the pregnant &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE Force of Imagination, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the imagination of pregnant women is capable to mutilate or deform the foetus, is an opinion of a very ancient date, and has been &s;upported by the &s;entiments of the young, and old, wi&s;e, and un|wi&s;e for &s;everal centuries pa&s;t. The ill effects of adopting this erroneous doctrine, I &s;hall forbear to enlarge
<PB N="2" REF="7">on. If I prove it to be built on irra|tional &s;uper&s;titious notions, the in|tent of the following pages will be &s;ufficiently an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Preparatory to this intention, I beg leave to ob&s;erve, "by imagination I under&s;tand (as Pope and Gay ex|pre&s;s it) that power which forms ideal or mental pictures;" this I apprehend is taking the word in its utmo&s;t la|titude; and, under this acceptation, we are to con&s;ider its effects, as they may tend to external objects; or, as they may influence the animal ma|chine.</P>
<P>It will require very little force of argument to &s;hew how ineffectual is the power of imagination, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, to influence, or obtain any change on external objects.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<P>The utmo&s;t exertion of its force can neither deprive the load&s;tone of its attraction, prevent the vegetation of plants, or &s;top the de&s;cent of rain. For, in &s;pite of our mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h|es, nature's laws will be predomi|nant; the load&s;tone will attract, plants will vegetate, and rain de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Could imagination &s;creen us from want, who&s;e wants would be un&s;up|plied? the mi&s;er would no longer have an object for his avarice, the ambitious would po&s;&s;e&s;s the extent of his ambition; and every man arrive to the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The impotency of ideal concep|tions being &s;o glaringly obvious, it would be an in&s;ult to our under&s;tand|ing to &s;uppo&s;e any change, either de|&s;igned, or unintended, could take
<PB N="4" REF="9">place on external objects; re&s;pecting their form, bulk, &s;ub&s;tance, or po|&s;ition, without &s;ome intervening pow|er. Hence then to form an object concording with our ideas, requires an a&s;&s;i&s;tance found only in art. By the intervention of this, we are enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t or prevent the effects of na|ture, though to pervert the &s;y&s;tem, baffles all human invention.</P>
<P>Being convinced of the inability of ideal conceptions to produce any change on external objects, it na|turally occurs to con&s;ider what influ|ence the imagination has over the human machine.</P>
<P>To attempt the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this con&s;ideration in its full extent would lead me into a labyrinth of philo|&s;ophic theories, doubts, and di&s;pu|tations.
<PB N="5" REF="10">The pa&s;&s;ions of the mind are an inexhau&s;tible fund for philo|&s;ophical inquiries. Every day &s;ome in&s;tances are to be ob&s;erved where anger, grief, joy, and &s;urprize have produced a&s;toni&s;hing changes in the human con&s;titution: neverthele&s;s, the&s;e effects remain inexplicable by the narrow limits of our phy&s;iologi|cal knowledge. Hence then I &s;hall limit this con&s;ideration to the point in que&s;tion, viz. the influence of the imagination on the foetus.</P>
<P>To judge of the propriety of what is hereafter to be advanced on this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome idea &s;hould be formed of the connections con&s;i&s;ting between the mother and embryo.</P>
<P>The foetus, or embryo during its &s;tay in the womb, is envelloped in a
<PB N="6" REF="11">peculiar &s;et of membranes (of a va&s;cu|lar, &s;pongy texture) aggregately term|ed the burden: from the attachment the burden forms to the womb &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts a con&s;tant circulation of blood between the mother and child.</P>
<P>This attachment is formed by an adhe&s;ion of the &s;pongy cells of the burden, to the veins and arteries of the womb; one &s;eries of the ve&s;&s;els contained in the burden, being fill|ed by means of its attachment to the womb with blood from that organ, after a variety of convolutions, empty their contents into the veins, form|ing a part of the umbilical cord, or navel-&s;tring. This cord, pa&s;&s;ing from a certain place in the burden, enters the body of the foetus at the navel; from whence, by wonderful mecha|ni&s;m, the blood is tran&s;ported to e|very
<PB N="7" REF="12">very part of the foetus, and ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e. To pre&s;erve a con&s;tant and free circulation, with|out which the foetus mu&s;t &s;uffer, the blood is returned from the child to the arteries of the navel-&s;tring, from whence it is di&s;per&s;ed into the burden; and, pa&s;&s;ing into the &s;pongy cells connected to the womb, enters the circulation of the mother; and hence between her and the child the inti|mate connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. The ill con&s;equences attending a detachment of the &s;pongy cells of the burden from the womb, are too obvious to need mentioning: to prevent them, comes not only under the province of the phy&s;ician, but the prudent care of every one.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician will tell you that a di&s;tention of the blood-ve&s;&s;els from
<PB N="8" REF="13">a preternatural fulne&s;s, or a relaxation from emptine&s;s; an undue velocity in the circulation, or too great lan|guor, are all capable of &s;eparating the burden from the womb; con&s;equent|ly, are all capable of producing abor|tion and mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>Your own good &s;en&s;e, ladies, will inform you that fear, grief, anxiety, joy, or &s;urprize, will retard or ac|celerate the circulating fluids, accord|ing to the actuating motive; hence, from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, mi&s;carriages fre|quently en&s;ue: and give me leave to add, this is the greate&s;t effect the foetus can experience from the power of imagination.</P>
<P>On a review of the connection &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between the mother and child, together with a reflection on the na|tural properties and u&s;e of the blood
<PB N="9" REF="14">in adults, it is very apparent nature intended this circulation, &s;olely for the nutrition and perfection of the foetus. From the &s;imilitude of its office, I think it may very aptly be compared to water, poured on a plant or &s;eed, without which, neither the plant would thrive or the &s;eed vege|tate. The &s;eed of a plant put into water, will by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a due degree of warmth and moi&s;ture, vegetate and produce a plant bearing the &s;ame characteri&s;tic marks, as that from which the &s;eed was gathered. The good or ill quality of the earth, the abundance or deficiency of wa|ter, the proper or improper tempe|rature of the air, will affect the &s;eed in no other way, than either totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ing its vegetation, or cau&s;ing it to &s;hoot forth in a more or le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="15">healthy &s;tate, as its nutritive e&s;&s;entials, earth, air, and water, were better, or wor&s;e adapted for vegetation in the &s;pecies of plant.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic marks of the plant all &s;pring from that &s;mall atom, the &s;eed; this particle is from the po&s;itive laws of nature decreed to &s;hoot forth into &s;uch marks, colours, and fibres, as the plant from which it was gathered is di&s;tingui&s;hed. The proper nouri&s;hment, as I &s;aid before, that is nece&s;&s;ary to vegetation, con|&s;i&s;ts of a due mixture and tempe|rature of the earth, air, and water. Notwith&s;tanding any defect that may occur in the&s;e nutritive princi|ples, the &s;eed, when it vegetates, will produce the characteri&s;tic marks of the plant, though in an unhealthy a&s;pect. To an impregnated woman,
<PB N="11" REF="16">it is ordained, by the &s;ame di&s;pen|&s;ing power, to produce an offspring bearing the characteri&s;tic marks of the human race. It is the office of the circulation, pa&s;&s;ing between the mother and child, to afford nouri&s;h|ment to the embryo; as it is the office of the elements to produce ve|getation in the vegetable kingdom.</P>
<P>Should &s;ickne&s;s, anxiety, or any cau&s;e what&s;oever, debilitate the con|&s;titution of the woman, the circu|lating fluids being thoroughly ren|dered incapable of affording proper nouri&s;hment; abortion, or the birth of a weakly, puny child, will be the con&s;equence. But the defects in the mother's con&s;titution, from whatever cau&s;e they may ari&s;e, can no more alter the original form the foetus was endued with, than earth, air, and
<PB N="12" REF="17">water, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the art of man, is capable to produce the flower of a ro&s;e from the &s;eed of a thi&s;tle. The inference I draw from this &s;imilitude, &s;erves only to corro|borate this indi&s;putable fact, viz. the organization of the embryo from the hour of impregnation; a fact every one tacitly acknowledges, who adopts the opinion, that impre&s;&s;ions are made on the foetus by the force of imagination. Such impre&s;&s;ions are &s;aid to be produced in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and not confined to any term of pregnancy.</P>
<P>The defects of a leg, toe, arm, or finger, have been a&s;cribed to a &s;udden &s;urprize on &s;eeing objects in that lamentable &s;tate. The very &s;uppo&s;ition tacitly implies the foetus was once perfectly formed, or rather
<PB N="13" REF="18">that the parts were, previous to the &s;urprize, in a natural &s;tate. If then the lo&s;s of a member is thus &s;uddenly accompli&s;hed, I &s;hould wi&s;h to know how the haemorrhage, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue from the di|vi&s;ion of &s;uch parts, was re&s;trained, and what became of the &s;eparated parts. For among all the tales I have heard relative to this &s;ubject, I do not recollect one that mentions the appearance either of an haemor|rhage, or of the &s;eparated part.</P>
<P>The impo&s;&s;ibility, &s;atisfactorily to an&s;wer the&s;e inquiries, would, I &s;hould think, &s;ufficiently evince the ab&s;urdity of the &s;uppo&s;ition. But as the&s;e inquiries are unan&s;werable, to explain them is never attempted, be|cau&s;e &s;uch an attempt, if impartially pur&s;ued, mu&s;t rai&s;e a train of ideas
<PB N="14" REF="19">that would inevitably de&s;troy an opi|nion that, as it has been &s;trongly in|culcated by the prejudice of educa|tion, requires more trouble to dive&s;t our&s;elves of, than mankind in gene|ral choo&s;e to take. But to return more immediately to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that ideal concep|tions can make no impre&s;&s;ions on ex|ternal objects; but as &s;uch we can|not con&s;ider the foetus (from it's be|ing &s;o intimately connected with the mother). Let us view it then in its proper light, viz. organized matter, placed in the womb, there to be nou|ri&s;hed, and brought to a certain degree of perfection, and then to be expelled.</P>
<P>We have ob&s;erved, that the nutri|tion nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of
<PB N="15" REF="20">the foetus, is obtained by the circu|lating fluids pa&s;&s;ing between it and the mother. Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e fluids, we know of no intercour&s;e, con&s;equently of no power, pa&s;&s;ing from the mother to the child, that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ub&s;ervient to the mother's imagination. Hence then, if to mutilate or deform the foetus is the effect of the mother's imagi|nation, the blood alone mu&s;t be the immediate acting principle. Whe|ther this principle has powers equal to the effects a&s;cribed, let plain common &s;en&s;e decide; and when it reflects that blood is a &s;mooth, oily fluid, will immediately acknow|ledge &s;uch con&s;i&s;tence &s;ufficiently demon&s;trates the blood's incapacity to mutilate the foetus, or impre&s;s any form imagination can devi&s;e.
<PB N="16" REF="21">Were the form of the foetus in the power of imagination, our offspring would be as &s;ubject to the ca|priciou&s;ne&s;s of mankind as our cloaths.</P>
<P>The form of the child's mouth, no&s;e, eye, eye-brow, or any of its features, would as much depend on the reigning fa&s;hion, as the cut of a cap, coat, or any part of our dre&s;s.</P>
<P>No fortunes would then be for|feited for deficiency of male heirs; nor unea&s;ine&s;s at the birth of a &s;on, when the mother ardently longed for a daughter.</P>
<P>If the imagination could take off, or place on, the foetus, a leg, toe, or arm, it could certainly remove all kind of blemi&s;hes. With &s;uch pow|erful
<PB N="17" REF="22">a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who would bear the deformity of wens, carbuncles, warts, &amp;c. the&s;e being excre&s;cences nou|ri&s;hed by the circulating fluids, and connected to the patient by blood|ve&s;&s;els, as the foetus is nouri&s;hed and connected to the mother? If the&s;e fluids are &s;o powerful in &s;ome ca&s;es, we may, from parity of rea&s;oning, expect the &s;ame in other.</P>
<P>It is evident the imagination, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted, can have no manner of effect on external objects: that as the foetus, from its &s;ituation, and intimate connection with the mo|ther, is to be con&s;idered as part of her fabrick; yet, as to mark, or mutilate, requires a due degree of force; and the only power capable of conveying &s;uch force to the foetus, in con&s;equence of the imagination,
<PB N="18" REF="23">is the blood; I think it is a very ob|vious inference, that the imagination is as incapable of effecting any im|pre&s;&s;ion on the foetus, as on any ex|ternal body what&s;oever.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, I hope I have &s;atisfactorily proved, the imagination can make no im|pre&s;&s;ion on the foetus. I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew, that the marks attributed to the force of imagination are effects proceeding from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The exact manner the&s;e marks are formed, is beyond the reach of my comprehen&s;ion to explain. To con|vince you they are not the effects of the cau&s;e a&s;cribed, let us convey our ideas to the vegetable and brute creation. In the former of the&s;e,
<PB N="19" REF="24">we &s;eldom &s;ee a collection of apples, pears, plumbs, nuts, &amp;c. but we di&s;cern &s;ome protuberance or defi|ciency in their re&s;pective form, &s;ome|thing altogether out of the general cour&s;e of nature. In the brute crea|tion, it is by no means a very un|frequent occurrence to meet cats, dogs, &s;heep, &amp;c. &amp;c. di&s;membered, and impre&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t va|riety of marks. Can we attribute the&s;e appearances to the force of imagination? We know of no &s;uch exi&s;tence in the vegetable kingdom; and in the brute creation, under the form of in&s;tinct only. It is univer|&s;ally acknowledged, there is no &s;a|tisfactory way to account for the&s;e appearances; we call them defi|ciences or luxuriances of nature. If, then, nature proves deficient in the
<PB N="20" REF="25">productions of the animal and vege|table kingdom, by what &s;y&s;tem of logic are we to expect &s;he will be infallible to the offspring of man?</P>
<P>Man claims a &s;uperiority over all other created beings, from his pecu|liar endowment, rea&s;on. This ble&s;&s;|ing con&s;titutes his dominion. Ne|verthele&s;s, the &s;ame omnipotent wi&s;|dom is ob&s;erved in the mechanical &s;tructure of a fly, as in the formation of man. Hence we may conclude, that no peculiar providence is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the perfection of man|kind, beyond tho&s;e laws of nature framed by the omnipotent Being for the perfection of every created object. When infants come into the world with narrow brea&s;ts, one &s;houlder higher than another, or with in|verted feet, we do not always attri|bute
<PB N="21" REF="26">them to the force of imagina|tion, but &s;ometimes to inexplicable cau&s;es in nature. If thus we ac|knowledge nature protrudes &s;ome parts, and contracts others, I think it would be a greater proof of our rea&s;on to attribute all impre&s;&s;ions and marks to the &s;ame &s;ource, than to believe the idle tales of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. It has never been &s;uppo&s;ed the imagination could change the &s;ex of the child; that has ever been deemed impo&s;&s;ible: but the &s;ame chain of arguments that will convince us of the imprac|ticability of &s;uch metamorpho&s;is, mu&s;t al&s;o convince us, that to mu|tilate or deform the foetus by the &s;ame power is equally impracticable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next offer to your con&s;i|deration a few thoughts on the long|ings,
<PB N="22" REF="27">and &s;trange ideas &s;ome preg|nant women are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with. Strange as the&s;e ideas are, they are not, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, pecu|liar to pregnancy, but are to be ob|&s;erved in men and maidens. What|ever may be the cau&s;e, I think they are evidently the &s;ymptoms of a de|praved ta&s;te or appetite.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e conver&s;ant in the practice of phy&s;ic, find it no very unu&s;ual thing for a patient (either in a fever, in an in&s;ane &s;tate of mind, or in the green-&s;ickne&s;s, which is the mo&s;t familiar) to crave after what, in an healthy &s;tate, they had conceived a great aver&s;ion to. Can we account for the&s;e cravings in any other way, than &s;aying they are the &s;ymptoms of a vitiated ta&s;te, brought on by a di&s;ea&s;e in the circulating fluids? To
<PB N="23" REF="28">believe this a fact, (and that it is &s;o, to me appears inconte&s;table) we mu&s;t im|mediately infer, that, as ta&s;te is a &s;en&s;e liable to be vitiated by an alteration in the circulating fluids, and as the di&s;po&s;ition of the circu|lating fluids evidently becomes alter|ed from impregnation, the de&s;ires and longings of pregnant women are to be con&s;idered, like tho&s;e of men, the mere effects of a depraved or vitiated ta&s;te.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, I hope, ladies, you are now &s;en&s;ible, no power of imagination can effect any mark or impre&s;&s;ion on the foetus. Neverthele&s;s, I apprehend, though your rea&s;on may in this coincide with my opinion, yet the prejudice of education is &s;o very predominant,
<PB N="24" REF="29">that you cannot totally dive&s;t your|&s;elves of the contrary opinion.</P>
<P>The many tales you have heard in its favour, has, as it were, forti|fied your mind again&s;t the convict|ing power of rea&s;on. To remove that barrier is a very difficult ta&s;k, as it is not always in our power im|mediately to dive&s;t our&s;elves of tho&s;e prejudices that have been adopted by our friends, and by them incul|cated with our education.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that all the tales which have formed the&s;e prejudices, and told us by our ance&s;tors with all the confidence of truth, believed by our prejudiced friends, who, to corroborate their father's, or grandfather's report, will atte&s;t &s;imilar occurrences to have happened within their own know|ledge:
<PB N="25" REF="30">I &s;ay for me to declare all the&s;e tales are fal&s;e and erroneous, would be deemed to their author's veracity the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ult, and in me &s;uch a &s;tep would appear the highe&s;t pitch of arrogance. To a|void the fir&s;t, and wave the imputa|tion of the latter, I &s;hall only &s;ay as my private opinion; that our friends rea&s;on hath been mi&s;led; and ei|ther the hi&s;tories have been mi&s;re|pre&s;ented, or the events recorded in them, ignorantly accounted for. In defence of this opinion, I beg leave to produce &s;ome in&s;tances, wherein will appear the ignorant credulity of two of the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers, as ever adorned the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>The great Sir Francis Bacon at|tributes the cure of &s;ome warts he
<PB N="26" REF="31">was afflicted with, to rubbing them with &s;ome lard, to which adhered the &s;kin, which was afterwards expo|&s;ed to a &s;outh wind.</P>
<P>The Hon. Mr. Boyle records as facts, among many other, the follow|ing hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>A great lady (far from being cre|dulous) confe&s;&s;ed to me, as al&s;o did &s;ome of her &s;ervants, that with the common remedy of a&s;h-a&s;hes, formed by warm urine, into &s;even or nine cakes, and buried &s;ome days in a dunghill, &s;he was cured of the yellow jaundice, after having pa&s;&s;ed thro' a tedious cour&s;e of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician afflicted with a mara&s;|mus, (a &s;pecies of con&s;umption) boil|ed an egg till it was hard, in his own urine; and with a bodkin perforated
<PB N="27" REF="32">the &s;hell in many places, and buried it in an ant's hill; where, as the emmets devoured it, he found his &s;trength return, and his di&s;ea&s;e de|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>Riverius tells us, that the daugh|ter of a great officer was exce&s;&s;ively tormented with a whitloe, for which he ordered her finger to be put into the cat's ear, and within two hours after &s;he was freed from pain.</P>
<P>The&s;e few in&s;tances I have &s;elect|ed, are &s;uch, that to believe them in the light the&s;e great men have &s;hewn them in, no one in this age, who boa&s;ts common &s;en&s;e, unentrammeled with &s;uper&s;tition, will pretend to. Neverthele&s;s, they are told with a confidence of their veracity, and told by men of inconte&s;ted learning, and
<PB N="28" REF="33">abilities. From &s;uch authorities why do we di&s;credit them?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, that &s;pirit of free enqui|ry, and general improvement, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the pre&s;ent aera, has con|vinced us, (tho' the facts may be deemed indi&s;putable) that neither expo&s;ing the lard's &s;kin to a &s;outh wind; burying the &s;even, or nine cakes of a&s;h-a&s;hes under a dunghill; the de&s;truction of the egg by the ants; or placing the finger in the cat's ear, effected the cure re&s;pec|tively a&s;cribed to each.</P>
<P>The melancholy effects &s;aid to a|ri&s;e from the &s;ting or bite of the tarantula, cured only by the charms of mu&s;ic, are almo&s;t univer&s;ally be|lieved, and too well-known to need a repetition; yet the&s;e effects are now
<PB N="29" REF="34">rejected by people of &s;en&s;e and di&s;|cernment, as tales propagated by knavery and impo&s;ition. The exi&s;t|ence of the tarantula is not doubted; but its bite, from experience, has been found attended with no other incon|venience, than would have en&s;ued from the &s;ting of a large gnat, or wa&s;p.</P>
<P>The &s;tories fir&s;t told of the &s;trange &s;ymptoms attending the bite of this &s;pider, were undoubtedly rai&s;ed to an&s;wer &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter view. The cre|dulous, &s;uper&s;titious multitude &s;wal|lowed the bait; and thus have ena|bled the cheat to be carried on to this very day, by cunning vagabonds, who, taking advantage of the &s;uper|&s;titious folly of the country, act, in confederacy with the fidler, (to excite
<PB N="30" REF="35">charity) the wild extravagant ge&s;|tures, &s;aid to be the &s;ymptoms pro|duced by the venomous bite of the tarantula.</P>
<P>This contradiction to the received opinion is now well atte&s;ted; but I believe the united te&s;timonies of all the learned in England, will never eradicate the contrary notions from the vulgar and illiterate.</P>
<P>In every age and clime, the crafty knave has found a multitude to re|ceive his impo&s;itions. The powers of amulets and charms; the bottle con|juror; rabbit woman; Cock-lane gho&s;t; witchcraft and fortune-tell|ing, are perpetual te&s;timonies of En|gli&s;h credulity.</P>
<P>If we pa&s;s to our neighbours un|der the papal juri&s;diction, we &s;hall
<PB N="31" REF="36">there find credulity in (if po&s;&s;ible) a more glaring, ab&s;urd light. When we reflect on this prevailing folly of mankind; and that phy&s;ick was once in the hands of prie&s;ts, &s;ubjected to all the impo&s;itions pagani&s;m, ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition could devi&s;e; we can|not wonder there &s;hould remain &s;ome tints of its former &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are wanting either of lei&s;ure or abilities to think for them|&s;elves in matters of &s;cience, are apt to place too great a faith in all that is told them: hence a continuance of error. And I think it is pretty obvious, while this oral tradition con|tinues, there ever will be &s;ome, who will rely on the influence of the moon and &s;tars; the powers of amulets and charms; and all &s;uch idle, unphilo&s;o|phical notions.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="37">
<P>The &s;ame chain of ideas, that &s;hews the impropriety of believing the cure of a tooth-ach by a charm; the de&s;truction of warts, by turning thief, and &s;tealing raw meat; the cure of the cramp, by wearing ro&s;e|mary, or placing the &s;oals of our &s;hoes uppermo&s;t when we go to bed: I &s;ay, the &s;ame chain of ideas that &s;hews the impropriety of believing the&s;e ab&s;urdities, will, when applied with a real de&s;ire to be informed, whether the imagination in pregnant women po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the powers a&s;cribed, convince the enquirer, that the tales told of the mother's imagination ex|erted on the foetus, are a collection of fal&s;ities formed by &s;uper&s;tition and ignorance, and continued by preju|dice and credulity.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="38">
<P>I have now, ladies, fini&s;hed my in|tended plan. Am &s;en&s;ible how dif|ficult a ta&s;k it is to remove deep|rooted prejudice: but, however un|&s;ucce&s;sful my attempt may be to that purpo&s;e, my intentions, I flatter my&s;elf, are irreproachable: and if the arguments I have u&s;ed, have not &s;uf|ficient weight to induce my fair rea|der to adopt my opinion, they are &s;uch as will not incur her cen&s;ure.</P>
