<HEAD>TO MR. G. HOLLAND, NO. 99, HIGH-HOLBORN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with yours of January 30th, inclo&s;ing &s;ome &s;pecimens of your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> and reque&s;ting my opinion concerning in medical properties, and the di&s;ea&s;es in which I think it is mo&s;t likely to prove beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P>As you a&s;&s;ure me that the fir&s;t hint of the medical utility of your manufac|ture was taken from my Dome&s;tic Medicine; and, that the favourable opi|nion which I expre&s;&s;ed of the &s;mall &s;ample you &s;hewed to me &s;ome years ago, had induced you to take out a Royal Patent for making it, I find my|&s;elf called upon to &s;upport my opinion; and I comply with your reque&s;t the more readily, as I am convinced that your di&s;covery will prove of e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice to many of my fellow creatures, labouring under the mo&s;t excruciating maladies.</P>
<P>Every one who is at all conver&s;ant in the&s;e matters knows, that, in this country, the mo&s;t fruitful &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e is ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. While the &s;ecretion from the &s;kin goes duly and uniformly on, few di&s;ea&s;es affect even the weak and delicate; but where this is ob&s;tructed the mo&s;t robu&s;t can|not long enjoy health.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The celebrated Sanctorius &s;ays, the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration alone di&s;charges more than all the &s;en&s;ible evacuations together; and that the proportion of this to all the other evacuations, is as five to three: though this proportion va|ries in different ages, climates, and con&s;titutions, yet it is of &s;uch importance in all, that where it is in any con&s;iderable degree deficient, a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the body will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Our in&s;ular &s;ituation renders the atmo&s;phere of this country liable to great and frequent changes, and as the&s;e changes are often very &s;udden, every one ought, as far as lies in his power, to guard again&s;t their influence, by adapting his clothing to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the &s;tate of the weather. In doing this he only imitates nature, who never fails to fortify tho&s;e animals which are left to her care again&s;t the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons, in tho&s;e countries where they are produced. Thus we find the foxes, bears, and other animals, in cold climates, covered with a thick coat of fur, which keeps continually varying with the &s;ea&s;ons, and gradually becoming longer and thicker, as the cold increa&s;es.</P>
<P>What nature does for the brute creation, art enables man to do for him|&s;elf, and he &s;eldom errs in following her example. Care is no doubt nece&s;|&s;ary in making the&s;e changes; but even here nature has not left us without a guide, &s;he effects this purpo&s;e by &s;low gradations, and never &s;tarts from one extreme to another. Though man cannot exactly copy her, in this re&s;pect, yet it is in his power to avoid all great and &s;udden tran&s;itions. Tho&s;e who heap on loads of clothes on the approach of winter, and are &s;o imprudent as to throw them off on the fir&s;t appearance of &s;pring, have them&s;elves only to blame, if the con&s;equences prove hurtful.</P>
<P>There is indeed a great &s;ource of deception in our &s;ea&s;ons; &s;ometimes the winter &s;ets in with all its rigour before it is expected, at other times it conti|nues mild throughout, and there is occa&s;ion for very little additional clothing, even to the delicate. But the mo&s;t in&s;idious &s;ea&s;on, in this country, is &s;pring. We have often in March, or April, a few days &s;o warm as to make us believe that &s;ummer is arrived, when all of a &s;udden it becomes more inten&s;ely cold than in the middle of winter. Indeed December is &s;ometimes mild through|out, while every day of May is cold and wet.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>This irregularity of our &s;ea&s;ons, renders it very difficult to lay down parti|cular rules for regulating the clothing of invalids. It is their bu&s;ine&s;s, there|fore, to watch the changes of the weather, and, as far as they conveniently can, to counteract their influence, by &s;uiting their clothing to the temperature of the air. The hardy and robu&s;t have indeed le&s;s to fear from the changes of wea|ther; but there is no per&s;on &s;o &s;trong as to be wholly &s;uperior to their influ|ence, and the fool-hardy often lo&s;e their lives by de&s;pi&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper clothing for counteracting the inclemency of our atmo|&s;phere, is certainly that which affords the greate&s;t warmth with the lea&s;t weight. There has not been hitherto, in the article of clothing, any thing invented where the&s;e properties have been &s;o happily combined, as in your <HI>Patent Ho&s;iery.</HI> I am informed that a &s;ingle blanket can be made equal, in point of warmth, to &s;ix of the common &s;ort, while it does not exceed the weight of one.</P>
<P>This difference, in re&s;pect of weight, is of great importance to the invalid. Hardly able to &s;upport his own weight, he can &s;till le&s;s bear a load of cloth|ing; and even to tho&s;e who are able to bear a load of clothes they prove hurtful. They compre&s;s the ve&s;&s;els, and impede the free circulation of the fluids, on which not only health, but even life it&s;elf depends; be&s;ides they encumber the body, and render it le&s;s fit for active exertions.</P>
<P>The manner in which your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> is made, gives it a degree of ela&s;ticity not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by cloth of any kind, from which many advantages are derived. Thus it adapts it&s;elf more readily to the figure of the body, or of any part to which it is applied; and, by acting like a perpetual &s;pring, the inner &s;urface operates as a fle&s;h-bru&s;h, by which means the di&s;charge from the &s;kin is promoted, and at the &s;ame time carried off by the conducting power of the wool.</P>
<P>In point of cleanline&s;s, its preference to fur mu&s;t be obvious to every one. It is not only free from the unplea&s;ant &s;mell which accompanies &s;kins of all kinds; but it can, at any time, be wa&s;hed with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, and without any con&s;iderable expence, or diminution of its properties; be&s;ides, it is cer|tainly le&s;s apt to harbour vermin, or communicate infection, than the &s;kins of animals.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>But the mo&s;t decided &s;uperiority of the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the powers which wool is found to po&s;&s;e&s;s, over all other articles of clothing, in ab|&s;orbing and conducting moi&s;ture. This appears from the experiments read before the Royal Society by Sir Benjamin Thom&s;on, which were made with a view to a&s;certain the powers of different &s;ub&s;tances, in ab&s;orbing moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments were made with &s;heeps wool, beavers fur, eider down, cotton wool, linen, and &s;ilk; and the re&s;ult was, that wool po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater power of ab&s;orbing moi&s;ture than any of the others, and was likewi&s;e better calculated for conducting or carrying off the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture from the body. Sir Benjamin's experiments are made with &s;uch accuracy, and the conclu&s;ions drawn from them, tend &s;o fully to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;uperiority of your manufacture over every other &s;pecies of clothing, that I &s;hall take the liberty of in&s;erting the ingenious author's inductions in his own words.</P>
<P>"I was totally mi&s;taken," &s;ays this candid writer, "in my conjectures rela|tive to the re&s;ults of the experiments with the other &s;ub&s;tances. As linen is known to attract water with &s;o much avidity, and as, on the contrary, wool, hair, feathers, and other like animal &s;ub&s;tances, are made wet with &s;o much difficulty, I had little doubt but that linen would be found to attract moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere with much greater force than any of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and that, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, it would be found to contain far more water; and was much confirmed in this opinion, on recollecting the great difference in the apparent dampne&s;s of linen and woollen clothes, when they were both expo&s;ed to the &s;ame atmo&s;phere. But the&s;e experiments have con|vinced me, that all my &s;peculations were founded on erroneous principles.</P>
<P>"It &s;hould &s;eem tho&s;e bodies which are the mo&s;t ea&s;ily wetted, or which receive water, in its unela&s;tic form, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, are not tho&s;e which in all ca&s;es attract the watery vapour di&s;&s;olved in the air with the greate&s;t force.</P>
<P>"Perhaps the apparent dampne&s;s of linen, to the touch, ari&s;es more from the ea&s;e with which that &s;ub&s;tance parts with the water it contains, than from the quantity of water it actually holds; in the &s;ame manner as a body appears hot to the touch, in con&s;equence of its parting freely with its heat, while ano|ther
<PB N="7" REF="6">body, which is actually at the &s;ame temperature, but which holds its heat with greater ob&s;tinacy, affects the &s;en&s;e of feeling much le&s;s violently.</P>
<P>"It is well known that woollen clothes, &s;uch as flannels, &amp;c. worn next the &s;kin, greatly promote in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. May not this ari&s;e principally from the &s;trong attraction which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between wool and the watery vapour which is continually i&s;&s;uing from the human body? That it does not depend entirely upon the warmth of that covering is clear; for the degree of warmth produced by wearing more clothing of a different kind, does not produce the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>"The per&s;piration of the human body being ab&s;orbed by a covering of flannel, is immediately di&s;tributed through the whole thickne&s;s of that &s;ub|&s;tance, and by that means expo&s;ed to a very large &s;urface to be carried off by the atmo&s;phere; and the lo&s;s of this watery vapour which the flannel &s;u&s;tains on the one &s;ide by evaporation, being immediately re&s;tored from the other, in con&s;equence of the &s;trong attraction between the flannel and the vapour, the pores of the &s;kin are di&s;encumbered, and they are continually &s;urrounded by a dry, warm, and &s;alubrious atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>"I am a&s;toni&s;hed that the cu&s;tom of wearing flannel next the &s;kin, &s;hould not have prevailed more univer&s;ally. I am confident it would prevent a mul|titude of di&s;ea&s;es; and I know of no greater luxury than the comfortable &s;en&s;ation which ari&s;es from wearing it, e&s;pecially after one is a little accu&s;|tomed to it.</P>
<P>"It is a mi&s;taken notion that it is too warm a clothing for &s;ummer. I have worn it in the hotte&s;t climates, and in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and never found the lea&s;t inconveniency from it. It is the warm bath of a per&s;piration, confined by a linen &s;hirt wet with &s;weat, which renders the &s;ummer heats of &s;outhern climates &s;o in&s;upportable; but flannel promotes per&s;piration, and favours its evaporation; and it is well known that evaporation produces po|&s;itive cold.</P>
<P>"I fir&s;t began to wear flannel, not from any knowledge that I had of its pro|perties, but merely on the recommendation of an able phy&s;ician; and when I began my experiments, I little thought of di&s;covering the phy&s;ical cau&s;e of the good effects which I had experienced from it, nor had I the mo&s;t di&s;tant
<PB N="8" REF="7">idea of mentioning the circum&s;tance. I &s;hall be happy, however, if what I have &s;aid, or done upon the &s;ubject, &s;hould induce others to make a trial of what I have &s;o long experienced with the greate&s;t advantage, and which I am confident they will find to contribute greatly to health, and con&s;equently to all the other comforts and enjoyments of life."</P>
<P>Had Sir Benjamin known how far your Manufacture exceeds flannel, both in agreeablene&s;s and u&s;e, he would have been &s;till more lavi&s;h in its prai&s;e. Indeed it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay too much in favour of a medicament of &s;uch exten&s;ive powers, and which is &s;o plea&s;ant in the application. Many people, who cannot bear the har&s;h feel of flannel, find the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> extremely agreeable, and indeed the fine&s;t down cannot be more delicately &s;oft than fine wool &s;pread on the &s;urface of a texture &s;imilar to that of your manufac|ture. That it is infinitely more plea&s;ant to the wearer, I can atte&s;t from my own experience.</P>
<P>On a review of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in which flannel is known to act, either as a preventive, or remedy, they will be found more numerous than all that are cured by any one article of the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> yet the powers of flannel, even in its mo&s;t improved &s;tate, fall greatly &s;hort of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery.</HI> It is not only of a &s;uperior fabric, but its warmth can be increa&s;ed to almo&s;t any degree, which cannot be done with flannel without rendering it too heavy for u&s;e.</P>
<P>Your invention is &s;till in its infancy; but, from what has already been done, we may venture to foretell, that it will become one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive branches of manufacture, as well as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful remedies; and that it will be of greater &s;ervice to the afflicted than all the boa&s;ted no&s;trums of the age, while it is entirely free from their dangerous qualities.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in which your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> will be found the be&s;t application, not merely as a preventive but as a remedy; and here I mu&s;t &s;tudy brevity, as the &s;ubject is by far too exten&s;ive to be fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the compa&s;s of a letter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> will, in general, be found an excellent medicine, both for the prevention and cure of all di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from ob&s;tructed per&s;piration.
<PB N="9" REF="8">The&s;e in our climate include a great variety of di&s;orders; as colds and coughs, catarrhal affections, fevers, fluxes, aches and pains, rheums, inflammations, &amp;c. To treat of all the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from this cau&s;e would require a vo|lume, I &s;hall therefore only touch on &s;uch as occur the mo&s;t frequently, and in which I think your manufacture the mo&s;t likely to prove u&s;eful.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>COLDS AND COUGHS.</HEAD>
<P>The phy&s;ician who &s;aid that colds killed more than plagues, told a &s;erious truth. Had he taught us how to avoid them, he had been one of the greate&s;t benefactors to the human race that ever appeared. Though your manufac|ture may not ab&s;olutely effect this great purpo&s;e; yet the proper u&s;e of it will go a greater length, both in the prevention and cure of colds, than the appli|cation of any other medicine with which I am acquainted. Mo&s;t people place confidence in drugs when they have caught a cold, which only de&s;troy their appetite, while the complaint might with ea&s;e and &s;afety be removed by a pro|per addition to their clothing; but it is in the nature of man to de&s;pi&s;e things that are plain and obvious, and to hunt after &s;ecret medicines; he neglects what is in his own power, while he has implicit faith in the boa&s;ted no&s;trum, merely becau&s;e he is ignorant of what it con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CATARRHAL AFFECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Catarrhal affections are of the nature of colds, and ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, viz. an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. An increa&s;ed &s;ecretion from the glands of the no&s;e, fauces, and throat, accompanied with &s;ome degree of fever, mark this di&s;ea&s;e, which, in cold and moi&s;t &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere, proves often &s;o common as to con&s;titute a true epidemic in this country. The only method of avoiding &s;uch complaints is to counteract the influence of the weather, as far as lies in our power. Your happy di&s;covery has enabled us to do this more effectually than any thing heretofore invented; without loading the body with clothes, it may now be kept &s;ufficiently warm, and the per&s;piration pretty uni|formly &s;upported, even in the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<HEAD>FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>That the &s;imple inflammatory fever is generally occa&s;ioned by an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, admits of no doubt. The effect of cold is to augment the tone of the &s;y&s;tem, by which means the action of the heart and arteries is increa&s;ed, and what is called the inflammatory diathe&s;is induced. Indeed every &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e &s;hews a plethora, or too great fullne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, which is the well-known effect of an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. The way to prevent this fever, of cour&s;e, is to keep up a regular per&s;piration: and to re&s;tore it when dimi|ni&s;hed, is the be&s;t method of cure.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Local affections of the inflammatory kind, as Saint Anthony's fire, the acute rheumati&s;m, inflammation of the brea&s;t, bowels, &amp;c. are likewi&s;e the genuine offspring of ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. In countries where the per&s;pira|tion goes on uniformly, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are hardly known; but every one knows their frequency, and multitudes feel their direful effects, in this country. They are &s;till however more dreadful in colder climates, where, as we learn from Boyle's Hi&s;tory of Cold, the inhabitants often die of affections of the Bowels, accompanied with the mo&s;t excruciating torment. There can be no doubt but a proper application of your manufacture might be of great u&s;e in pre|venting the&s;e maladies.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DIARRHOEA.</HEAD>
<P>The diarrhoea, and other affections of the bowels, are often occa&s;ioned by ob&s;tructed per&s;piration; nor can any thing relieve the&s;e complaints more ef|fectually than re&s;toring this nece&s;&s;ary evacuation. I have often known an ob|&s;tinate loo&s;ene&s;s cured by the patient's wearing flannel next his &s;kin; but what|ever can be done by flannel, more is &s;urely to be expected from the u&s;e of your manufacture; and I would advi&s;e all per&s;ons who have tender bowels, to keep up a due per&s;piration, by wearing it of a proper thickne&s;s. This will be found more agreeable, and likewi&s;e more &s;afe than the u&s;e of a&s;tringent medicines.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HEAD>HYPOCHONDRIACAL AFFECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>All people of delicate nerves have tender bowels, and though they &s;hould not wear it any where el&s;e, they would do well to keep the &s;tomach and bowels covered with a piece of your comfortable clothing, of a &s;ufficient thickne&s;s. Even this partial u&s;e of it will, in many ca&s;es, be of &s;ingular &s;ervice. Tho&s;e who have weak lungs, will reap equal advantage from wearing a piece of it over the brea&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to the common angina, or inflammation of the throat, will find a piece of your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> worn about the neck, the be&s;t preven|tive, nor is it by any means an indifferent remedy. It is more efficacious, and much more agreeable, than the common practice of applying a dirty &s;tock|ing round the neck.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>Among&s;t the foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, where the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> is proper, &s;tands the gout. Per&s;ons &s;ubject to this di&s;order ought to keep up the per&s;piration at all times, e&s;pecially in the extremities. This will be found one of the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t preventives, and al&s;o the mo&s;t agreeable that can be employed. To keep the part ea&s;y, &s;oft, and uniformly warm, is almo&s;t all we can do, during a paroxy&s;m or fit of the gout. For this purpo&s;e there is not any thing better calculated than the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery.</HI> I have recommended wool in the gout, for above thirty years, and have never found cau&s;e to change my opinion of it. Your manufacture, however, is in many re&s;pects pre&s;era|ble to wool, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all its properties without the incoveniences attending the application of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>The rheumati&s;m is not only a more common, but al&s;o a more ob&s;tinate di&s;order than the gout. That it admits of no remedy, &s;ave <HI>patience and flannel,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="11">is an old adage. We can now, however, boa&s;t of a remedy far &s;uperior to the be&s;t flannel. The advantages of the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> over flannel will appear on the flighte&s;t in&s;pection; but on trial it is &s;till more obvious. I have often re|commended it in rheumatic affections, and have never been di&s;appointed in my expectations from it. In the chronic rheumati&s;m, indeed, it requires time; yet even here it will be found to perform a cure &s;ooner than any other remedy.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ACHES AND PAINS.</HEAD>
<P>In every part of this i&s;land, where I have been, the old people univer&s;ally complain of what they call pains in their limbs. This is evidently a &s;pe|cies of the rheumati&s;m, and is peculiarly incident to women who live on poor diet, are thinly clothed, and inhabit cold damp hou&s;es. It does not appear to me, that any thing could be &s;o beneficial to the&s;e people as to have their limbs clothed in your comfortable woollen manufacture. This would cer|tainly prove the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t tho&s;e pains, which not only render the&s;e poor people very mi&s;erable, but often a burthen to &s;ociety. They can|not indeed always purcha&s;e it them&s;elves, but the benevolent could not em|ploy their charity better than in &s;upplying them with an article &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for health; and even tho&s;e who have the care of the poor ought, on princi|ples of economy, to &s;upply them with this kind of clothing, to prevent their becoming totally unfit for labour, and con&s;equently a greater burthen to the public.</P>

<P>There is no di&s;ea&s;e the cure of which depends more on promoting per&s;pira|tion than the drop&s;y. In all patients labouring under this malady the &s;ecre|tion from the &s;kin is defective, and ought by all means to be promoted. This cannot be done &s;o agreeably, and I will add &s;o effectually, as by wearing your manufacture of a &s;ufficient thickne&s;s. I am credibly informed that the drop&s;y has been cured by the patient's wearing your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> after the mo&s;t powerful medicines, accompanied with the u&s;e of flannel, had proved totally ineffectual.</P>

<HEAD>ASTHMA.</HEAD>
<P>People afflicted with the a&s;thma are always in danger, and often lo&s;e their lives from a &s;udden check of per&s;piration. They ought carefully to watch the changes of the weather, and to fortify them&s;elves again&s;t them by adapt|ing their clothing to the temperature of the atmo&s;phere. I would advi&s;e a&s;thmatic patients to beware of the cold, raw, ea&s;terly winds, which prevail in our &s;pring, and towards the &s;etting in of winter, and to avail them&s;elves of your happy di&s;covery for counteracting their influence.</P>

<HEAD>APOPLEXY.</HEAD>
<P>The apoplexy is now &s;o frequent as to become truly alarming. It &s;eldom, however, attacks people till the decline of life, when the per&s;piration becomes defective, and the &s;kin grows dry and rigid. When the di&s;charge from the &s;kin is ob&s;tructed to &s;uch a degree, that the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture of the body cannot be carried off by the other emunctories, or common outlets, a <HI>plethora,</HI> or too great fullne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, mu&s;t en&s;ue. This will induce a predi&s;po&s;i|tion to apoplexy. To ward off the dreadful blow as long as po&s;&s;ible, the per&s;piration mu&s;t be kept up; and I know not any thing more proper for this purpo&s;e than your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> prudently applied, and accompanied with a &s;ufficient degree of bodily exerci&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>PALSY.</HEAD>
<P>The apoplexy and pal&s;y make their attack about the &s;ame time of life, and often accompany each other, which renders it probable, that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, they depend on the &s;ame cau&s;e. That your manufacture is calcu|lated to prevent the pal&s;y, I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but I am certain that, in many ca&s;es, it will be found a very proper remedy. The torpor of a paralytic limb renders &s;ome warm and &s;timulating application nece&s;&s;ary, and this intention is more likely to be an&s;wered by your ho&s;iery than flannel, as it not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater degree of warmth, but is, from its texture, better adapted to act as a &s;timulus to the &s;kin.</P>

<HEAD>DEAFNESS.</HEAD>
<P>Few things prove more trouble&s;ome to per&s;ons in the decline of life than deafne&s;s. This is generally occa&s;ioned by cold in the head. I have often known deafne&s;s cured by a warm night-cap; and would recommend it to all who are afflicted with this malady, to wear caps of your manufacture. The&s;e caps will not only remove deafne&s;s, but will be found likewi&s;e to obviate many other complaints, as the tooth-ach, head-ach, pains of the face, &amp;c. In all ca&s;es where the head is wet, either by bathing or violent exerci&s;e, the&s;e caps will be found of the greate&s;t &s;ervice. This I am told has been fre|quently experienced by &s;port&s;men, who, by u&s;ing them when heated in the chace, have never caught cold. There are no people &s;o carele&s;s as the in|habitants of this country, with regard to the covering of their heads during the night; and this neglect is the &s;ource of many di&s;orders, be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned above.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SKIN DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>Cleanline&s;s and warm clothing are the great preventives of &s;kin di&s;ea&s;es. Where the &s;kin is not &s;ufficiently defended again&s;t the inclemency of the wea|ther, it becomes rigid, and con&s;equently unfit for tran&s;mitting the per&s;pirable matter through its pores. The internal di&s;orders, ari&s;ing from this cau&s;e, have already been taken notice of. The external are, &s;cabby and &s;caly eruptions, foul blotches, defedation of the &s;kin, chilblains, and &s;uch like. The&s;e are al|ways found to prevail mo&s;t among the poor, who go dirty and are ill clothed. The chilblains, indeed, affect young people of all ranks, yet this complaint might generally be prevented by keeping the feet and legs dry, and &s;ufficiently warm. For this purpo&s;e I know of no application equal to your foot-&s;ocks and fleecy ho&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> is not only beneficial in many di&s;ea&s;es, but in various &s;ituations, where men are nece&s;&s;arily placed, it will be found the be&s;t pre&s;er|vative of health. For example, in countries where agues prevail, and the pallid inhabitants are &s;hook, like the a&s;pine leaf, for at lea&s;t one half the year, there is rea&s;on to believe, that a &s;pecies of clothing &s;o perfectly adapted to defend
<PB N="15" REF="14">the body again&s;t the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, and keep up an uniform de|gree of warmth, would be found &s;uperior, both in &s;afety and efficacy, to any in|ternal medicine whatever. Indeed the internal medicines made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, are generally of &s;uch a nature that, if they keep off one di&s;ea&s;e, they induce others, which prove equally if not more fatal.</P>
<P>How pernicious that kind of clothing mu&s;t be which retains the moi&s;ture, and keeps it in continual contact with the body, to men who work in damp &s;ituations, will appear from Sir Benjamin Thom&s;on's experiments; and the advantage of the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> in conducting it off, will be no le&s;s obvious. Spalden, the celebrated diver, told me that he could not live under water in any dre&s;s but flannel. In other clothing he was chilled with cold, but, with a &s;ufficient quantity of flannel, he found him&s;elf pretty comfortable. Had he known the &s;uperior advantages of your manufacture, he would no doubt have been &s;till more &s;o.</P>
<P>To travellers, in cold countries, your manufacture mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t u&s;e, particularly the fleecy gloves and foot ba&s;kets. The extremities always &s;uffer mo&s;t from cold, and are in the greate&s;t danger of mortification. I &s;hall not be &s;urprized if your manufacture become the common clothing of the northern nations. Where the inhabitants are obliged to have recour&s;e to furs in winter, the fleecy clothing will, I am convinced, be found to an&s;wer their purpo&s;e much better, and will likewi&s;e prove far more agreeable to the wearer.</P>
<P>It will not, however, &s;o readily occur, that the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> is the mo&s;t proper clothing for the inhabitants of hot climates; yet this is acknowledged to be the ca&s;e by all who have made the trial. It can certainly be made more light than any other kind of cloathing, and with &s;o thin a &s;prinkling of wool, as to act more as a cooler than a heater of the body, while it conducts off the moi&s;ture from the &s;kin much fa&s;ter than any other kind of cloathing.</P>
<P>There is no &s;et of men to whom the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery</HI> is likely to prove more beneficial, than tho&s;e who have lived in hot climates; they univer&s;ally complain, that, even with the warme&s;t flannel and thicke&s;t clothing, they are not able to &s;upport the inclemency of our winters. Tho&s;e, however, to whom I have
<PB N="16" REF="15">had an opportunity of recommending your manufacture, have all told me, that, by wearing it next their &s;kin, they have found them&s;elves &s;ufficiently warm and comfortable, even in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons who &s;it to read, write, or work, e&s;pecially in cold rooms, ought to have their feet and legs clothed in your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery.</HI> In &s;uch peo|ple, the circulation in the limbs is ob&s;tructed by &s;itting, and a chilly torpor brought on the feet and legs, which paves the way to edematous &s;wel|lings, paralytic affections, and the like.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of &s;u&s;pended animation, as it is called, where a per&s;on is to all appearance dead, and where the great object is to recall the latent principle of life, by re&s;toring the genial warmth, and exciting the actions of the &s;y&s;tem, it will be readily allowed that few things are likely to have a more happy effect than wrapping the body in &s;ome of the thicke&s;t of your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> made as hot as po&s;&s;ible. This will not only receive a much greater degree of heat than a common blanket, but, retaining the heat longer, will be found a much more &s;uitable application than the other, while it is &s;ooner and more ea&s;ily prepared than a warm bath.</P>
<P>I can imagine many &s;ituations where your manufacture would be of &s;ingular &s;ervice, both to &s;ailors and &s;oldiers. The former are often obliged to keep on their wet cloaths for whole days together, and the latter to continue in camp during cold and wet &s;ea&s;ons, or in a low damp country. I have been told by &s;everal of the officers who lay in camp on Newca&s;tle Moor, in winter 1745, that half the army mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by cold, had it not been for the flan|nel wai&s;tcoats given to the &s;oldiers by the&s;e good people called Quakers. No one who has &s;een it needs to be told, that your manufacture would prove more beneficial than flannel to men in &s;uch &s;ituations.</P>
<P>In point of economy, few things will be found to equal your invention. It will not only &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of furs, but, in many ca&s;es, even of fuel; which, to the inhabitants of cold countries, proves very expen&s;ive. Nor does the evil end here. Per&s;ons who &s;it roa&s;ting them&s;elves near a great fire injure their health. They breathe a burnt, unwhole&s;ome air, and, after all, are but half warmed. A per&s;on clothed in a fufficient thickne&s;s of your
<PB N="17" REF="16">manufacture will hardly find occa&s;ion for fire in any &s;ituation; and he will feel him&s;elf much more comfortable than by the fire-&s;ide, where he is burnt on on the one &s;ide, and frozen on the other. In one word, your invention may truly be &s;aid to unite economy, plea&s;ure, and u&s;efulne&s;s; which is more than mo&s;t of our modern di&s;coveries can boa&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this letter, already too long, by recommending to you the mo&s;t active per&s;everance in the pro&s;ecution of your plan. You have not only made a great improvement in the woollen manufacture, but al&s;o in medicine. Your <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> judiciou&s;ly applied, will not only in many ca&s;es pre&s;erve health, but prove more beneficial to the afflicted than any thing that has been di&s;covered in the medical art for the&s;e many years: like other u&s;eful di&s;overies, however, it will meet with oppo&s;ition; but patience and per&s;everance will overcome it all, and you will find, be&s;ide the brave defender of Gibraltar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Right Honourable Lord Heathfield wrote a letter to the patentee, &s;etting forth the benefits he had received from the <HI>Fleecy Ho&s;iery,</HI> and promi&s;ing to recommend it to his friends, both at home and abroad,</NOTE>, many who will &s;tep forward to do ju&s;tice to your u&s;eful invention</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IF the &s;entiments contained in this letter wanted the &s;anction of authority, it would be ea&s;y to adduce a number of eminent authors, both ancient and modern, who have entertained the &s;ame ideas. The celebrated Boerhaave u&s;ed to &s;ay, that nobody &s;uffered from cold, except beggars and fools: the former not being able to purcha&s;e clothes, and the latter not having &s;en&s;e to u&s;e them. This certainly &s;hews, that, in the learned Doctor's opinion, the effects of cold might be obviated by a proper attention to clothing.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of the celebrated Mr. Boyle, who&s;e delicacy of con&s;titution rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to adapt the warmth of his cloathing to the &s;tate of the weather, that he had a ve&s;ture &s;uited to every &s;ea&s;on of the year; and it is much in favour of his plan, that, although a valetudinarian, he died at an advanced age.</P>
<P>But the author who&s;e &s;entiments are mo&s;t in point is the learned Sancto|rius, Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ic at Padua, who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the doctrine of in|&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration on undeniable grounds, and &s;hewed its importance in the animal economy, and its influence on health. Though the doctor lived in a more temperate climate than ours, yet the following aphori&s;ms, which are &s;elected from a great number, will &s;hew how much he thought health de|pended on the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration being duly and regularly kept up.</P>
