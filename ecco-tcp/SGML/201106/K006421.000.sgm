<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS On the BILLS of MORTALITY, In CARLISLE, for the YEAR 1779.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages which may be derived from accurate regi&s;ters of Mortality, are thus illu&s;trated by an ingenious Philo&s;opher and Phy&s;ician; "The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a judicious and accurate regi&s;ter of the births and burials, in every town and pari&s;h, would be attended with the mo&s;t important advantages, medical, political, and moral. By &s;uch an in&s;titution, the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of certain di&s;ea&s;es; the comparative healthine&s;s of different &s;ituations, climates, and &s;ea&s;ons; the influence of particular trades and manu|factures on longevity; with many other curious circum&s;tances, not more intere&s;ting to Phy|&s;icians, than beneficial to mankind, would be a&s;certained with tolerable preci&s;ion. In a poli|tical view, exact regi&s;ters of human Mortality are of &s;till greater con&s;equence, as the num|ber of people and progre&s;s of population in the kingdom, may in the mo&s;t ea&s;y and unexcep|tionable manner, be deduced from them. They are the foundation likewi&s;e of all calculations concerning the values of a&s;&s;urances on lives, rever&s;ionary payments, and of every &s;cheme for providing annuities for widows, and per&s;ons in old age. In a moral light al&s;o &s;uch <HI>Tables</HI> are of evident utility, as the increa&s;e of vice or virtue may be determined, by ob&s;erving the proportion which the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from luxury, intemperance, and other &s;imilar cau&s;es bear to the re&s;t; and in what particular places di&s;tempers of this cla&s;s are found to be mo&s;t fatal." <HI>Percival's E&s;&s;ays, vol.</HI> 2d.</P>
<P>CARLISLE is &s;ituated in Latitude 54.55 North, and is &s;urrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference. The &s;ituation is rendered exceedingly plea&s;ant by its vicinity to three beautiful Rivers, with which it is almo&s;t &s;urrounded. <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Eden</HI> on the north ea&s;t &s;ide, <HI>Peterel</HI> on the &s;outh ea&s;t, and <HI>Caldew</HI> on the north we&s;t. CARLISLE contains two Pari&s;h Churches, <HI>viz. St. Mary's and St. Cuthbert's,</HI> be&s;ide two Pre&s;byterian, and a Quaker's Meeting Hou&s;e. A very con&s;iderable Linen Manufactory is carried on in this City, and the Printing of Calicoes is &s;till more exten&s;ive. The air about CARLISLE is pure and dry, the &s;oil chiefly &s;and and clay. No mar&s;hes or &s;tagnant waters corrupt the the atmo&s;phere; its neighbourhood to a branch of the &s;ea, and its due di&s;tance from the mountains on all &s;ides render the air temperate and moderate.</P>
<P>In July 1763, at the reque&s;t of the late Lord Bi&s;hop of CARLISLE, the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the <HI>Rev. Mr Richard&s;on,</HI> the <HI>Rev. Mr Simp&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Mr Alderman Hodg&s;on.</HI> There were at that time in the City and Suburbs, 1059 families, and 4158 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In January 1780, a very careful and accurate &s;urvey was made by <HI>Mr Stanger and Mr Howard,</HI> under my own in&s;pection. When there were in the di&s;trict before &s;urveyed, 891 hou&s;es, 1605 families, and 6299 inhabitants. For a more particular account of the &s;urvey &s;ee Tables I. II. III.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>This a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of 2141 inhabitants, which is above half of the original number, in the &s;mall &s;pace of &s;eventeen years, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be attributed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactories for the Printing of Calicoes. About the year 1761, <HI>Mr Brummel</HI> intro|duced this kind of manufactory; and notwith&s;tanding the many difficulties, which naturally attend any new in&s;titution, by his activity, per&s;everance, and abilities he &s;urmounted them all, and the art is now brought to great perfection. Soon after, &s;everal other gentlemen followed his example. There are at pre&s;ent four companies who daily employ about eight hundred indu&s;trious poor, in this Manufactory.</P>
<P>This increa&s;e of population too has taken place, during that very period, in which <HI>Dr Price</HI> a&s;&s;erts the depopulation of <HI>Great Eritain</HI> to have been rapid and progre&s;&s;ive. And what makes this increa&s;e more remarkable, CARLISLE has during the whole period alluded to, been con&s;tantly &s;upplying the army, the navy, the metropolis, and even the di&s;tant regions of <HI>India</HI> with her hardy, active, and enterprizing &s;ons.</P>
<P>From Tables No. II. and IV. we can with plea&s;ure demon&s;trate the extreme &s;alubrity of CARLISLE even in a very unhealthy year; a year in which no le&s;s than 129 per&s;ons were cut off by two epidemic di&s;orders, <HI>viz.</HI> the Small Pox and Scarlet Fever. By the Bills of Mor|tality publi&s;hed in different towns in <HI>England,</HI> as well as the Continent it appears on an ave|rage, that in Vienna about 1 in 19 and a half of the inhabitants die annually; in London 1 in 20 and three quarters; in Edinburgh 1 in 20 and four fifths; in Leeds 1 in 21 and three fifths; in Dublin 1 in 22; in Rome 1 in 23; in Am&s;terdam 1 in 24; in Bre&s;law, 1 in 25; in Berlin 1 in 26 and a half; in Northampton and Shrew&s;bury 1 in 26 and a half; in Liver|pool 1 in 27 and a half; in Manche&s;ter 1 in 28; in Che&s;ter 1 in 40; but in the year 1774 when the Small Pox were very general and fatal 1 in 27; and in the Pari&s;h of Sedburgh in the County of York 1 in 37 and a half; and in Blandford Forum in Dor&s;et, 1 in 39; in CARLISLE this year 1 in 30 and three ninths.</P>
<P>Tables No. III. and V. are of the utmo&s;t importance to the Phy&s;ician, the Politician, and the Calculator of Annuities, and to every one who has the health and happine&s;s of him&s;elf and family at heart. They at one view &s;hew what di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t incident and fatal to particular periods of life. They clearly demon&s;trate as far as one year's ob&s;ervation can have weight, what periods of life are the mo&s;t healthy, what are the mo&s;t obnoxions to di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee in CARLISLE one in 6 and nine tenths nearly, of all the inhabitants under 5 years old, die annually; betwixt 5 and 10 years old 1 in 64 and &s;ix &s;evenths; 10-15, 1 in 119 and one &s;ixth; 15-20, 1 in 168 and three fourths; 20-30, 1 in 132 and four fifths; 30-40, 1 in 146 and one &s;ixth; 40-50, 1 in 95 and one third; 50-60, 1 in 58 and four fifths; 60-70, 1 in 24 and one third; 70-80, 1 in 13 and three fifths nearly; 80-90 1 in 4 and five &s;ixths; and between 90 and 100 years exactly 1 in 5. As no particular epidemic di&s;ea&s;e occurred la&s;t year which had any con&s;iderable effect on the lives of adult per&s;ons, it is apprehended the&s;e calculations for the periods above 10 years old, will not be attended with much variation in other years.</P>
<P>That women in general live longer than men, is almo&s;t univer&s;ally agreed, and the following ob&s;ervations tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion. During the la&s;t year 12 per&s;ons died between 30 and 90 years old, 8 of the&s;e were females, and between 90 and 100, 2 died, both females. See Table IV. In Table III. we &s;ee two people are above 100 years old and the&s;e likewi&s;e are &s;emales.</P>
<P>Table II. which contains the number of Hu&s;bands, Wives, &amp;c. Shews how inferior in number Widowers are to Widows. There are above four Widows to one Widower, an a&s;ton|i&s;hing
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">di&s;proportion, in what manner is it to be accounted for? The following cau&s;es are conceived to operate con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>I. Men are in general more intemperate than women. II. They are expo&s;ed to greater hard&s;hips and dangers. III. Widowers perhaps in general have greater opportunities of get|ting wives, than widows have of getting hu&s;bands. IV. Widows have a greater propen|&s;ity to live in towns than widowers. V. and la&s;tly, The con&s;titutions of males, as &s;itted for more violent and laborious exertions, are firmer and more robu&s;t than tho&s;e of females; their mu&s;cular and nervous &s;ibres, may therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to become &s;tiff, rigid, and incapable of performing the functions nece&s;&s;ary to health and life &s;ooner than tho&s;e of females, both on account of their original texture, and the friction which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occur from laborious exerci&s;e. But from whatever cau&s;es the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may ari&s;e, the fact it&s;elf is &s;ufficiently a&s;certained by Table IV. where we find that between the ages of 60 and 70, altho there are a greater number of wives than hu&s;bands, yet 11 hu&s;bands and only four wives have died, and of all different ages 29 hu&s;bands and 16 wives.</P>
<P>The Table of Deaths and Di&s;ea&s;es No V. is as accurate as circum&s;tances and the &s;ituation of things would po&s;&s;ibly admit. With re&s;pect to the Small Pox, and Searlet Fever, their &s;ymptoms and marks are &s;ufficiently evident to prevent any ambiguity. 24 have died of unknown di&s;ea&s;es, which is a great number, but which mu&s;t ever be the ea&s;e at CARLISLE where many of the lower cla&s;s (although they may have advice gratis) never call in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Only &s;eventeen have fallen victims to Con&s;umptions, a number but &s;mall, when compared with the number, which u&s;ually die of that di&s;order in other towns, and &s;till &s;maller when we con&s;ider how many are employed in the manufactories of weaving and Calicoe printing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding the impurity of the air breathed by Calicoe Printers, and the &s;udden changes of heat and cold which they are &s;ubject to, yet men following that bu&s;ine&s;s, are ob&s;erved to be very healthy. May not this be owing to the acid &s;teams continually exhaling in a Print Shop?</NOTE>, where they continually breathe air by no means the mo&s;t pure; and where they are &s;ubject to &s;udden alterations of heat and cold. 5 per&s;ons have died of this di&s;ea&s;e between 20 and 30 (&s;ee Table No V.) which con&s;irms the general ob&s;ervation, that during that period of life people are mo&s;t liable to Con&s;umptions. It therefore behoves &s;uch to be very cautious upon catching cold, lea&s;t by neglect and delay, a complaint which at the beginning might have been ea&s;ily removed, &s;hould gather &s;trength, and at la&s;t terminate in a fatal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Three died of Drop&s;y <HI>(viz. Ana&s;arca)</HI> which in all was evidently occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive intemperance. Nervous and putrid fevers are not very frequent; no more than five have &s;uf|fered by both the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which mu&s;t appear &s;omewhat a&s;toni&s;hing to one who knows how many inhabitants there are of the lowe&s;t rank, who are crouded in clo&s;e and &s;mall apartments where they &s;leep, eat, and prepare their victuals; who&s;e food can not be the mo&s;t nutritive; who &s;eldom change their cloaths; and who pay but little attention to cleanline&s;s. May not the &s;treams of water, which fortunately run near the mo&s;t crouded parts of the town, tend to purify the air and prevent putrid fevers.</P>
<P>Agues or intermittent fevers are &s;carce ever known, a &s;trong proof that the effluvia ari&s;ing from mar&s;hes is the principle &s;ource of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In February, a poor girl either for &s;ome real, or imaginary complaint, was advi&s;ed by an acquaintance as ignorant as her&s;elf, to take a large quantity of &s;teel filings, which had been procured from a White Smith, or Watch-Maker. Not long after &s;he had taken them, &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="4">was &s;eized with pains in her &s;tomach and bowels, which &s;oon increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t violent de|gree. Every remedy which could be &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;eful either in a &s;evere cholic, or inflammation of the &s;tomach, was fried, but in vain. She continued in the greate&s;t agony for two days and then expired.</P>
<P>During her &s;ickne&s;s &s;he was repeatedly a&s;ked, if &s;he coud a&s;&s;ign any cau&s;e for her di&s;order, but &s;he always an&s;wered in the negative. Soon after her death, however, &s;ome &s;teel &s;ilings were found in her room, and another &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, on being examined, confe&s;&s;ed that the decea&s;ed had taken three tea &s;poonfuls mixed with treacle, a few hours before &s;he began to be ill. Three tea &s;poonfuls of the filings which were found, weighed &s;ix drams and a half, and upon examining them with a magnet, I found a quantity of lead and &s;ome copper filings. Had the &s;teel been pure, the quantity alone was &s;ufficient to have produced fatal effects, but here no doubt the lead and the copper would add con&s;iderably to its acrimony.</P>
<P>Let the death of this unfortunate young woman be a caution to others; and let Watch-Makers and White Smiths be careful to whom they &s;ell &s;teel filings, e&s;pecially till they are &s;eparated from every impurity by the load&s;tone or &s;ome other method.</P>
<P>During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence, and &s;wept off a great num|ber of children, <HI>viz.</HI> the Small Pox and a &s;pecies of the Scarlet Fever. As the <HI>Scarlatina Angiur&s;a</HI> or Scarlet Fever and Sore Throat is rather an uncommon di&s;ea&s;e, and not perfectly un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;tood, it will not be improper to take notice of it in this place. The limits, however, of this &s;heet, will by no means admit a thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a di&s;ea&s;e, which has within the&s;e two years been &s;o general and &s;o fatal to children. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with defining the Scarlet Fever and Sore Throat as it occurred at CARLISLE; afterwards attempt to point out its nature; the &s;ymptoms by which it is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from other di&s;ea&s;es; its ter|minations; and la&s;tly its method of cure. This epidemic made its appearance in July, was at its <HI>acme</HI> during September and October, and gradually abated till the latter end of De|cember, when it almo&s;t entirely di&s;&s;appeared.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DEFINITION.</HEAD>
<P>The Scarlet Fever and Sore Throat, is a contagious inflammatory fever. On the &s;econd day of the fever, the throat becomes &s;tiff and &s;ore, attended with &s;ome difficulty of &s;wallowing; on the third, &s;ometimes not till the fourth, the face begins to &s;well and grows florid; this &s;welling and redne&s;s, &s;oon become &s;o univer&s;al, as to make the whole body re&s;emble a boiled lob&s;ter in colour. On the &s;eventh, or eighth day, the &s;welling and &s;carlet colour gradually abate, and the &s;carf &s;hin becomes rough, and peels off in &s;mall branny &s;cales.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DIAGNOSTIC SYMPTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>To an inaccurate ob&s;erver, this di&s;ea&s;e may &s;eem to bear a very near re&s;emblance to many eruptive fevers; the intelligent and attentive practitioner, will however, find no difficulty in di&s;criminating it from all, but the <HI>Cynanche Maligna</HI> or Putrid Sore Throat, which e&s;pe|cially at the commencement of the Epidemic will be no ea&s;y matter. The di&s;tinction how|ever, is extremely nece&s;&s;ary, as the method of cure is almo&s;t diametrically oppo&s;ite. We
<PB N="5" REF="5">&s;hall therefore attempt it. Both di&s;ea&s;es are highly contagious; both attended with a fever; both with an affection of the throat; and both with an eruption of the &s;kin. Yet each di&s;|ea&s;e has its peculiar fever; peculiar &s;ore throat; and peculiar eruption. In the <HI>Cynanche</HI> (both for the &s;ake of brevity and per&s;pecuity we &s;hall make u&s;e of the Generic term) the fever is con|&s;tantly accompanied with a weak, quick, &s;mall and un&s;teady pul&s;e. In the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> the pul&s;e is quick, full, but &s;eldom hard. In the <HI>Cynanche</HI> the throat and fauces are full of creeping ulcers, covered with browni&s;h a&s;h coloured &s;loughs. In the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> there are &s;eldom any ulcers, but often whiti&s;h mucous &s;loughs &s;ometimes extending over the whole tongue and in&s;ide of the mouth, which may be ea&s;ily wa&s;hed off with a little wine and water. The eruption in the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> is florid, univer&s;al, &s;mooth, &s;eldom prominent, and always dry. In the <HI>Cynanche,</HI> neither &s;o florid, nor &s;o univer&s;al, and in general rough, prominent, and often moi&s;t. The <HI>Cynanche</HI> chiefly affects the weak and delicate; females, more frequently than males; whereas robu&s;t, and plethoric children are more &s;ubject to the <HI>Scarlatina.</HI> The <HI>Cynanche</HI> is almo&s;t con&s;tantly accompanied with a fetid breath, and an acrid corro&s;ive humour is di&s;charged from the mouth, no&s;e, and anus, which excoriates the &s;kin. The&s;e di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms rarely occur in the <HI>Scarlatina.</HI> In the <HI>Cynanche,</HI> the colour of the blood is florid, its texture loo&s;e and tender. In the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> it is firm and covered with a buffy coat. The <HI>Cynanche</HI> is cured by tonics and anti&s;eptics; bleeding, purging, and emetics, are uni|ver&s;ally hurtful. The principal remedies to be depended upon in the cure of the <HI>Scarlatina,</HI> are blood letting, emetics and the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen. La&s;tly the <HI>Cynanche</HI> is highly putrid. The <HI>Scarlatina</HI> is inflammatory, as may be ea&s;ily deduced from the following cir|cum&s;tances, 1&s;t. The robu&s;t and plethoric are more &s;ubject to it than the weak and delicate. 2d, There is a manife&s;t &s;welling, redne&s;s and inflammation of the &s;kin. 3d, The pul&s;e is full, and generally ri&s;es after the fir&s;t bleeding. 4th, The &s;urface of the blood is covered with a firm buffy coat. 5th, In ca&s;es, where the lancet was not freely u&s;ed, &s;uppurations &s;ome|times occurred in the throat. 6th, and la&s;tly, evident advantages were derived from bleeding.</P>

<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>From the definition already delivered, we learn that the Scarlet Fever and Sore Throat is a contagious di&s;order. The occa&s;ional or immediate cau&s;e mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily be a peculiar kind of poi&s;on, of a volatile nature, readily mixing with the air. And many circum&s;tances render it probable that it is fir&s;t applied to the mucus membrane which lines the mouth, no&s;e, fauces, &s;tomach, &amp;c. Emetics therefore are indicated, as remedies the mo&s;t likely, to expel either the whole or a part of this poi&s;onous matter; and if they were u&s;ed &s;oon after the application of the poi&s;on, it is probable the di&s;ea&s;e might in many ca&s;es be prevented. It is a certain fact, they have been employed with great advantage, and ought never to be omitted. The efficacy of Emetics does not however, by any means &s;olely depend on their expelling the contagious virus; they unload the &s;tomach, often gently move the belly, and have con&s;ider|able effect in producing a copious &s;weat, and in removing a &s;pa&s;m of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els on the
<PB N="6" REF="6">&s;urface of the body, which is a part of the proximate cau&s;e of all Fevers. <HI>Emetic Tartar</HI> di&s;&s;olved in water appears to be the be&s;t vomit.</P>
<P>Of all the remedies made u&s;e of in this Epidemic, none were of more real advantage than bleeding, which was &s;ometimes repeated three or four times; &s;o great was its efficacy, that I believe not one patient died, who lo&s;t a &s;ufficient quantity of blood early in the di&s;ea&s;e. Many ca&s;es however occurred where the mildne&s;s of the complaint rendered bleeding and al|mo&s;t every other remedy unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Saline Mixture with a &s;mall addition of Tartar Emetic, was of &s;ignal &s;ervice. It acted as a diuretic, &s;udorific and gentle laxative. Immer&s;ion of the feet and legs in warm water, often promoted per&s;piration and a tendency to &s;leep. A Gargle of red wine and wa|ter was u&s;eful in wa&s;hing off any mucous &s;loughs. The judicious application of the&s;e reme|dies, with plenty of diluents, and the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen &s;eldom or never failed to pro|duce the mo&s;t happy effects.</P>
<P>Nearly about the &s;ame time, the Small Pox (&s;ee table No V.) began to rage with great violence. As the per&s;ons affected with this di&s;ea&s;e were chiefly of the lower cla&s;s, who &s;el|dom called in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the preci&s;e number: from the in|formation however which I have had, it appears, that about 300, were during the la&s;t &s;ix months of the year, &s;eized with the Small Pox in the natural way. Of the&s;e no le&s;s than 90 fell victims to its virulence. Hence near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural Small Pox, which while at the &s;ame time it &s;erves as a melancholy proof of its fatal effects, points out the great and &s;alutary advantages which are derived from inoculation. During the &s;ame period &s;everal hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of CARLISLE, and it is a plea&s;ing truth, that not one of them died. Had tho&s;e 300 been inoculated it is more than probable that of the 90 not above 6 would have died, and even the&s;e not of inocula|tion but of other di&s;orders. Hence we &s;ee 84 per&s;ons might have been &s;aved to their parents and the public. Yet &s;o great is the prejudice again&s;t the &s;alutary practice of inoculation among&s;t the vulgar, that few, very few, can be prevailed upon either by promi&s;es, rewards, or intreaties to &s;ubmit to the operation. No wonder that in rude, ignorant, and barbarous times, &s;uper&s;tition hurried men into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities; when in a poli&s;hed and enlightened age; in an age too, when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demon&s;trated the utility of inoculation, we &s;ee the bulk of mankind ready to &s;acrifice their children and all that is dear to them, to a fooli&s;h prejudice.</P>
