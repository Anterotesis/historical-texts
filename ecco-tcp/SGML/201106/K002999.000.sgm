<P>ALTHO' Fractures of the Ster|num are de&s;cribed by every writer on the accidents to which the bones are &s;ubject, yet they appear to have &s;eldom occurred, even to the olde&s;t practitioner. All tho&s;e authors whom I have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting, very fully de&s;cribe in what manner this accident may hap|pen, and as fully pre&s;cribe the rules to be ob&s;erved in the treatment of it. They &s;eem, however, to have copied from each other, without adducing any proofs to corroborate their a&s;&s;er|tions. DU VERNEY, in his excellent Treati&s;e on the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Bones,
<PB N="iv" REF="4">is the only writer (that I have met with) who enters fully and circum|&s;tantially into Fractures of this part, he mentions three ca&s;es which had occurred to him, two of which proved in&s;tantly fatal; and the third recover|ed, but the patient remained an in|valid during the re&s;t of his life. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erts, that all Fractures of the Sternum are to be regarded as mortal; <Q>"tho' there have been pa|tients who&s;e con&s;titutions have held out, and have been cured."</Q> I can only regret that he gives no informa|tion where tho&s;e ca&s;es are recorded.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of the following ca&s;e, the unexpected favourable ter|mination
<PB N="v" REF="5">of it, together with the &s;olicitations of my friends, are the motives which induce me to have a few copies printed for their peru&s;al.</P>
<P>My particular thanks are due to my worthy Friend and Colleague DR. SKEETE, and to MR. HAIGHTON, for their kind advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance during the progre&s;s of the cure. They who are acquainted with the profe&s;&s;ional abilities of tho&s;e Gentlemen, will rather approve my &s;ilence, than com|mend me for any further eulogium on their merits.</P>

<HEAD>CASE OF A FRACTURED STERNUM.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN OATES, aged 38, by trade a cabinet-maker, being in company with &s;ome friends at a Tavern, and drink|ing freely, a di&s;pute aro&s;e, which termi|nated in blows, and he was unfortunately thrown down with &s;uch violence on the edge of a chair, as to cau&s;e a fracture of the Sternum, about four inches above the en&s;iform cartilage.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>Being carried home, a neighbouring Apothecary was &s;ent for, who ordered &s;ome draughts to be taken, and a volatile liniment to embrocate the part. Symptoms, how|ever, &s;oon became alarming, great pain and difficulty in re&s;piration, cough, and oppre&s;&s;ion on the lungs. The&s;e complaints were &s;uffered to increa&s;e, without any means being u&s;ed to alleviate them, for the &s;pace of one week. He often &s;poke with cer|tainty of his brea&s;t being broken, and &s;aid he could <Q>"feel the bones jar again&s;t each other."</Q></P>
<P>Obtaining no relief, and being po&s;itively told that his complaint was only a brui&s;e, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Apothecary, and applied to the NEW FINSBURY DISPENSARY, on <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> the 23d <HI>January,</HI> 1787. He was immediately vi&s;ited by DR. SKEETE
<PB N="9" REF="8">and my&s;elf, with MR. HAIGHTON, who happened to call on me that morning. On examination, we perceived that a fracture had taken place as de&s;cribed above, but how much of the bone was depre&s;&s;ed, or how deep the depre&s;&s;ion might be, we could not readily a&s;certain, owing to an inflam|mation which occupied the inferior and middle part of the Sternum, and which &s;eemed ha&s;tily advancing to &s;uppuration. His pul&s;e was hard and full, the cough frequent, and attended with &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety to the patient, that he &s;aid he &s;hould be perfectly well if the cough could be &s;topped; for at that time he could plainly feel the broken edges of the bone grate on each other, the irritation of which was al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable, and prevented his taking any re&s;t.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>He was immediately blooded to the quantity of &s;ixteen ounces, which was much inflamed, a laxative mixture ordered to be taken occa&s;ionally, an emul&s;ion of Sperm. Ceti, cum Sal. Nitri, and Tinct. Thebaic. every three hours; and every other means u&s;ed to obviate the effects which we imagined would be the con&s;equences of &s;uch an acci|dent. On the day following, the pul&s;e was rather &s;ofter, and the re&s;piration not quite &s;o laborious; ten ounces more of blood were taken from him, which had the &s;ame inflammatory appearance; the inflam|mation on the Sternum was more circum|&s;cribed, and evidently &s;hewed that &s;ome pus was already formed. The laxative medicine was ordered to be repeated, and thirty drops of Tinct. Thebaic to be taken at night.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>Symptoms continued much the &s;ame till Saturday, the 27th of January, when Mr. COOPER, Surgeon to Guy's Ho&s;pital, fa|voured me with his company, and was of opinion that the ab&s;ce&s;s on the Sternum &s;hould be immediately opened. About &s;ix ounces of pus were di&s;charged. On pa&s;&s;ing my finger to the bottom of the wound, I expected to have di&s;covered the broken portion of bone, but did not, probably owing to the parts having become thickened in con&s;equence of the preceding inflamma|tion. The fracture, however, was evident to one &s;en&s;e, though not to the other; for on the patient de&s;iring us to place our ear on the wound, we could hear the edges of the bone grate on each other at every in|&s;piration. The pul&s;e being &s;till full, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to draw &s;ix ounces more of blood. He had no re&s;t this night, the
<PB N="12" REF="11">cough being ince&s;&s;ant. On Sunday, the 28th, the countenance appeared much de|jected, the &s;kin hot, but the pul&s;e calm; I ordered the opiate to be increa&s;ed to &s;eventy drops of Tinct. Thebaic, and ap|plied a bandage, or rather a girt, (&s;uch as I u&s;e in fractures of the ribs, and which is made to buckle to what degree of tight|ne&s;s may be requi&s;ite) in hopes of being able to confine the motion of the Sternum, and thereby prevent the irritation which the fracture produced. I intended to have ap|plied this bandage when I fir&s;t vi&s;ited him, but it was thought that if much pre&s;&s;ure was thrown on the ribs, it might probably cau&s;e the inferior broken part of the bone to protrude through the inflamed integu|ments, and be productive of much danger; the bandage was therefore deferred till the ab&s;ce&s;s was opened, and the bone not being
<PB N="13" REF="12">evident to the touch, we had le&s;s to fear from the application of a moderate pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>He experienced much relief in con&s;e|quence of the bandage being applied, the cough was greatly abated, the opiate pro|cured a &s;ound &s;leep, and the bone was not trouble&s;ome in in&s;piration; the pul&s;e was perfectly calm, and the wound di&s;charged a healthy pus. He was now ordered &s;ome mutton broth, having hitherto been confined to water-gruel.</P>
<P>From this time to Monday the &s;ixth of February, the &s;ymptoms indicated much danger; he &s;weated profu&s;ely, coughed in|ce&s;&s;antly, and what he expectorated was often tinged with blood. He took liberally of a decoction of Bark with Elixir of Vitriol, drank warm milk every morning, and u&s;ed &s;uch nouri&s;hing articles of diet as
<PB N="14" REF="13">were directed by DR. SKEETE. This plan &s;eemed to &s;ucceed, for from the 6th to 12th of February, the &s;weats were much dimini&s;hed, and the cough le&s;s frequent; but the wound di&s;charged a foetid ichor in great abundance, which proceeded from a &s;inus extending above, and for &s;ome &s;pace round the &s;uperior part of the wound. We were now of opinion that this ichorous di&s;|charge might proceed from the edges of the broken bone, if &s;o, it became advi&s;e|able to make a further opening, to endea|vour to reach the foundation of the mi&s;|chief, and then pur&s;ue &s;uch a cour&s;e as might be indicated from examining the condition of the parts.</P>
<P>This, however, was delayed till Saturday, the 17th of February, as for &s;ome days we plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the idea that the
<PB N="15" REF="14">parts would unite independent of our in|terference, e&s;pecially as the di&s;charge from the wound became thicker; (DR. SKEETE having added Gum Myrrh to the decoction of Bark) but we were unhappily di&s;ap|pointed in our expectations; and as no time was to be lo&s;t, I informed him of the plan which (on con&s;ultation) we intended to follow, viz. to make an inci&s;ion down to the bone, to examine its condition, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, to remove whatever part of it might, in our opinion, be an ob&s;tacle to a perfect union. He readily a&s;&s;ented to what|ever might be judged expedient for his relief; not on his own account, having &s;uffered &s;o much that life was become a burden, but for the &s;ake of his wife and five infant children, who&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;tence de|pended &s;olely on his labour. I made an inci&s;ion from about an inch above the edge
<PB N="16" REF="15">of the old wound, and continued it to the bottom, the knife grated on the bone, and the inferior part became evident to the touch, tho' covered externally with a &s;mooth granulation. It now appeared that the fracture was not immediately on the centre of the Sternum, but more inclined to the right &s;ide of it; that portion to which the ribs are united was firmly attached to them, and in con&s;equence of the inci&s;ion, the fractured part had &s;eparated from its &s;itua|tion, and expo&s;ed the cavity of the media&s;ti|num. I pa&s;&s;ed my finger into the cavity, and felt the parts <HI>apparently</HI> carious on each &s;ide. We now could only conjecture that a large exfoliation would en&s;ue; but, in all proba|bility, the con&s;equence of this operation might prove fatal, either by the pus lodging in the cavity of the media&s;tinum, or by cau&s;ing that irritation often con&s;equent to
<PB N="17" REF="16">the expo&s;ure of cavities. Theory certainly ju&s;tified us in the&s;e conclu&s;ions, but practice has happily convinced us that notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couragements, there was &s;till a method left to prevent what we had &s;o much rea&s;on to fear. The bone, tho' broken, was not denuded, both the &s;uperior and inferior portions were covered with granulations; it then became an object to endeavour to promote a union of tho&s;e parts by incarnation, &s;imilar to what occurs in compound fractures, in which light it might now certainly be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that on the day fol|lowing, I found him much better, he be|came ea&s;ier after the operation, coughed but little, and &s;lept the greate&s;t part of the night without taking the opiate; this was the fir&s;t natural &s;leep he had enjoyed &s;ince
<PB N="18" REF="17">the accident happened, for the opiates only &s;erved to palliate the cough, without pro|curing any refre&s;hing &s;leep, altho' he gene|rally took one hundred drops of Tinct. Thebaic; the expectoration al&s;o appeared more frothy, and he had no difficulty in di&s;charging it from the lungs. This amend|ment was but temporary, for from the 17th to the 24th of February, the opiates were again obliged to be given. Our attempts to procure a union of the parts proved abortive, and the inferior edge of the bone protruded through the wound at every in|&s;piration, and con&s;equently expo&s;ed the cavity of the media&s;tinum. There &s;eemed no pro&s;pect of any exfoliation, I therefore omitted the former bandage, as it appeared to have no power to an&s;wer the intention we had in view, and pa&s;&s;ed a common roller round the inferior part of the Sternum;
<PB N="19" REF="18">the pre&s;&s;ure of this brought the lower por|tion in contact with the upper, and we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing a union effected in a few days. The &s;weats from this time totally cea&s;ed, and the cough was not trouble&s;ome. I removed him to I&s;lington, for the benefit of the air, there the cough entirely left him, and he &s;lept without taking the opiate.</P>
<P>When he attempted a deep in&s;piration, he felt a &s;mall pre&s;&s;ure on the fractured part, and al&s;o on the right &s;ide of the wound; which &s;ide was evidently enlarged, and felt as if the cartilages of the ribs had received &s;ome injury from the fall. He complained that the air was too &s;harp for him, and (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion) <Q>"felt like vinegar in his no&s;trils;"</Q> indeed this was &s;o much the ca&s;e, that if he &s;tood at the
<PB N="20" REF="19" MS="y">window when open, or attempted to walk out, the air in&s;tantly cau&s;ed him to &s;neeze violently, which gave great pain to the fractured part. I was therefore obliged to remove him from I&s;lington, where he only continued four days; and for two or three nights after he returned home, the cough again became violent, &s;o that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating the opiates. As the wound healed, the cough abated, and his only complaint was that of great weak|ne&s;s, and a total inability to u&s;e his arms with any freedom of motion. He could &s;toop to buckle his &s;hoe, could take up any weight, but was utterly unable to perform any <HI>lateral motion.</HI></P>
<P>March. During this month, he was perfectly free from complaint; had taken Pulv. Cort. Peruv. 3. ter die. The
<PB N="21" REF="20">enlargement related to have been on the right &s;ide of the wound was much le&s;&s;ened, but an ab&s;ce&s;s formed on that &s;ide imme|diately on the brea&s;t, which broke on Friday, the 30th of March. It appeared quite &s;uperficial, and to have had no con|nection with the original injury.</P>
<P>April. The wound on the Sternum was now healed to about the &s;ize of a &s;ix-pence, and from this a va&s;t di&s;charge was daily evacuated; &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome &s;inus, I pa&s;&s;ed the probe, and found one, which extended about two inches on the right &s;ide between the two inferior cartilages, directly above that enlargement already mentioned. This &s;inus was laid open, and continued di&s;charg|ing till the beginning of Augu&s;t, when it was propo&s;ed to apply a cau&s;tic on the part; the action of which laid bare the
<PB N="22" REF="21">fractured portions of the bone, the &s;uperior edge greatly depre&s;&s;ed, and the intermediate &s;pace filled with a kind of membranous &s;ub&s;tance, which had prevented an o&s;&s;ific union of the parts. It was now curious to ob&s;erve the proce&s;s which nature was daily executing, in order to fill up the vacuity; at every dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome new excitement was perceived; increa&s;ed va&s;cularity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In order more fully to comprehend what I mean by an "increa&s;ed va&s;cularity," it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that when the &s;lough (which the action of the cau&s;tic had produced) was &s;eparated from the Sternum, a very large portion of the inferior part of the bone <HI>appeared</HI> to be entirely deprived of the living principle; but fortunately this was not the ca&s;e; every day's in&s;pection fully proved it, by that portion becoming more and more florid, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a gla&s;s, we could plainly di&s;cover new ve&s;&s;els &s;hooting in a tran&s;ver&s;e direction through the o&s;&s;eous fibres. I therefore tru&s;t that the term of "increa&s;ed va&s;cularity," is not mi&s;|applied, and I am at a lo&s;s for any other to expre&s;s my meaning more intelligibly.</NOTE> in the living portions of bone, by which the carious
<PB N="23" REF="22">part became more &s;eparated, and granu|lations ari&s;ing from the &s;urrounding &s;oft parts. On the 10th of October, the exfo|liation from the inferior part took place, the portion of bone was but &s;mall, healthy granulations being &s;ub&s;tituted in its place.</P>
<P>We now a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with an ela&s;tic tru&s;s, which proved of &s;o much &s;ervice as to enable him again to follow his bu&s;ine&s;s of a cabinet-maker. This tru&s;s makes an equal pre&s;&s;ure on each &s;ide of the brea&s;t, and &s;upports the &s;ternum in &s;uch a manner, that if he takes it off, he &s;ays, he feels <Q>"as if his in&s;ide was falling in pieces."</Q> With|out it, he is incapable of performing any lateral motion.</P>
<P>The wound now healed, without any in|terruption, and was perfectly cicatrized on the 23d of October.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<P>The following ob&s;ervations are &s;uch as will naturally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves on an at|tentive con&s;ideration of the above facts.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the ca&s;e was attended with con&s;iderable danger, throughout the greater part of its progre&s;s; but from very different, and even oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances, at different periods. In the beginning, the &s;ymptoms of inflammation in the Thorax &s;eemed to be &s;o general and violent, that without the free u&s;e of the lancet, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by dilution and the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen, it is pro|bable that a fatal termination would &s;peedily have en&s;ued; but the only method by which this could be prevented, doubtle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted in inducing that &s;tate of debility and hectic under which the patient was afterwards in danger of &s;inking, and which required the liberal exhibition of Bark, Elixir of Vitriol,
<PB N="25" REF="24">Myrrh, and &s;uch nouri&s;hing articles of diet as were judiciou&s;ly pre&s;cribed by Dr. Skeete. The &s;ame thing happens in many ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e which fall under the care of the Surgeon; and the pre&s;ent in&s;tance is a &s;trong illu&s;tration of the nece&s;&s;ity of a particular attention being required to the &s;tate of the con&s;titution, as well as to the condition of the di&s;ea&s;ed part.</P>
<P>Secondly, It may appear extraordinary, that notwith&s;tanding the frequent expo&s;ure of the cavity of the Media&s;tinum, which &s;eemed to take place when the broken edges of the bone were &s;eparated, during the alternate motions of in&s;piration and expi|ration, that this expo&s;ure was not followed by any repeated attack of inflammation, or by any effu&s;ion of pus into the cavities of the Thorax, tho' we had more than once &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to apprehend &s;uch effects,
<PB N="26" REF="25">e&s;pecially when the expectoration a&s;&s;umed a purulent and bloody appearance, with &s;ymptoms of hectic. The event therefore &s;eems to prove that &s;uch adhe&s;ions mu&s;t have taken place between the Lungs and Pleura in the neighbourhood of the injured part, as compleatly to have prevented any &s;uch effect.</P>
<P>Thirdly, After &s;ome months, the treatment was almo&s;t entirely confined to the part; the healing of the wound being prevented by the &s;tate of the bone underneath, as has been already mentioned.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance which the Sternum has &s;u&s;tained, is at pre&s;ent &s;upplied by granulation only; and whether nature will in this ca&s;e, as in many others, re&s;tore the part to its original &s;tate, by a bony depo&s;ition, time alone will be able to di&s;cover.</P>

<P>SINCE the foregoing &s;heets came from the pre&s;s, I have read an account of a Fractured Sternum, in the EDINBURGH MEDICAL COMMENTARIES, Vol. IV. p. 185, by Mr. George Borthwick, Surgeon to the 14th regiment of Dragoons. In many in|&s;tances the &s;ymptoms agreed with tho&s;e mentioned in my ca&s;e, particularly the grating noi&s;e in the time of re&s;piration. Mr. Borthwick being immediately called in, prevented that train of dangerous &s;ymptoms which unfortunately befel my patient. The account being drawn up with great preci&s;ion, I refer my reader to the book it&s;elf for further information.</P>
