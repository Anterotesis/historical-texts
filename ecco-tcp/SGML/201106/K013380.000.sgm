<P>A few days ago, I received from the country an account of a woman who was delivered of five children at a birth in April la&s;t.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MARGARET WADDINGTON, aged twenty-one, a poor woman of the town&s;hip of Lower Darwin, near Blackburn in Lanca&s;hire, formerly delivered of one child at the full term of pregnancy, conceived a &s;econd time about the beginning of December 1785, and from that period became affected with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms that attend breeding. At the end of the fir&s;t month, &s;he became lame, complained of con&s;iderable pains in her loins, and the enlargement of her body was &s;o remarkably rapid, that &s;he was then judged by her neighbours to be almo&s;t half gone with child. At the end of the &s;econd month &s;he found her&s;elf &s;omewhat larger, and her breeding complaints continued to increa&s;e. When the third month was completed, &s;he thought her&s;elf fully as large as &s;he had formerly been in her ninth month, and to her former &s;ymptoms of nau&s;ea, vo|miting, lamene&s;s, and pain of the loins, &s;he had now added a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;hortne&s;s of breath. She continued to increa&s;e &s;o rapidly in &s;ize, that &s;he thought &s;he could perceive her&s;elf growing larger every day, and &s;he was under the frequent nece&s;&s;ity of widening her cloaths. When &s;he reckoned her&s;elf eighteen weeks gone, &s;he fir&s;t perceived &s;omewhat indi&s;tinctly the motion of a child. By the 20th of April, 1786, all her complaints were become much more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; &s;he had much ten&s;ion and pain over all the abdomen, her vomiting was in|ce&s;&s;ant, and &s;he now could not make water but with the utmo&s;t difficulty. The &s;ymptoms being palliated by Mr. LANCASTER, &s;he advanced in her pregnancy to Monday the 24th of April, when being &s;uppo&s;ed to have arrived at the twentieth week, &s;he was &s;eized with labour pains. The&s;e continued gradually to increa&s;e till the next day, about two in the afternoon; at which time I was &s;ent for, Mr. LANCASTER being ab&s;ent;
<PB N="6" REF="5">and &s;he was &s;oon delivered of a &s;mall, dead, but not putrid, female child. The pains continuing, this was &s;oon followed by a &s;econd le&s;s child; to this very &s;oon &s;ucceeded a third, larger than the fir&s;t, which was alive; to the&s;e a fourth &s;oon followed, &s;omewhat larger than the fir&s;t, and very putrid; la&s;t of all, there &s;oon &s;ucceeded a fifth child, larger than any of the former, and born alive. The&s;e five children were all fe|males; two were born alive; and the whole operation was per|formed in the &s;pace of fifty minutes. The fir&s;t made its ap|pearance at two in the afternoon, and the la&s;t at ten minutes before three. Each child pre&s;ented naturally, was preceded by a &s;eparate bur&s;t of water, and was delivered by the natural pains only. In a &s;hort time after the birth of the la&s;t, the placenta was expelled by nature without any haemorrhage, was uncommonly large, and in &s;ome places beginning to be putrid. It con&s;i&s;ted of one uniform continued cake, and was not divided into di&s;tinct placentulae, the lobulated appearance being nearly equal all over. Each funis was contained in a &s;eparate cell, within which each child had been lodged; and it was ea&s;y to perceive, by the &s;tate of the funis, and that part of the pla|centa to which it adhered, in which &s;ac the dead, and in which the living children had been contained. I examined the &s;epta of the cells very carefully, but could not divide them as u&s;ual into di&s;tinct laminae, nor determine which was chorion or which amnios. I could not prevail on the good women to allow me to carry it home, to be more narrowly in&s;pected; and I &s;ubmitted more readily to their prejudice for its being burned, as its very &s;oft texture &s;eemed to me to render it hardly capable to bear injection. The two living children having &s;ur|vived their birth but a &s;hort time, I was allowed to carry them home; and I have pre&s;erved the whole five in &s;pirits, and have
<PB N="7" REF="6">&s;ince weighed and mea&s;ured them, and find their proportions to be as follows in Avoirdupois weight, inches and parts.</P>

<P>The mother, in &s;pite of the crowds with which her cham|ber was continually filled, continued to recover, and was able to be out of bed on the 27th and 28th, her third and fourth days; but finding her&s;elf then weak, by my advice, kept her bed till the 11th of May, when &s;he went out of doors, and on the 21&s;t walked to Blackburn, two miles di&s;tant. This was the 27th day from her delivery, &s;he having entirely recovered her &s;trength without any accident.

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on numerous Births.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the females of the human &s;pecies produce mo&s;t commonly but one child at a birth; and though their formation with only two brea&s;ts, and one nipple to each, renders it probable they were not originally intended to produce in general more than two; yet, from what we know of the womb and its appendages, and what from the late&s;t experiments we are led to conjecture as to the mode of con|ception, we cannot pre&s;ume <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> to &s;et limits to the fertility of nature, nor determine deci&s;ively what number of foetu&s;es may be conceived and nouri&s;hed to a certain period in the human uterus at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ingular and well-atte&s;ted ca&s;e a&s;&s;ures us, that five have certainly been born at once, and we have no title ab&s;olutely to reject all the te&s;timonies of even more numerous births, or to &s;ay that, in &s;ome rare in&s;tances, this number has never been exceeded.</P>
<P>What has tended to render relations of this &s;ort ridiculous, and to throw a degree of di&s;credit on the whole, is the many marvellous, and evidently ab&s;urd and incredible hi&s;tories, which not only the retailers of prodigies, but even the credulous writers of medical ob&s;ervations, have collected.</P>
<P>I need only refer tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to amu&s;e them&s;elves with &s;urpri&s;ing relations of this kind, to the curious collections of SCHENKIUS, SCHURIGIUE, AMBROSE PAREY, and others.</P>
<P>But, in order to &s;hew how very uncommon births of this kind are, and how truly &s;ingular the ca&s;e communicated by Mr. HULL to Dr. BLANE is, I take the liberty to &s;ubjoin a
<PB N="9" REF="8">&s;hort view of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature in this matter among our own country-women, where we are lea&s;t likely to be deceived.</P>
<P>Though female fertility certainly varies according to the climate, &s;ituation, and manner of life; yet, I believe, it may be taken for a general rule, that where people live in the mo&s;t &s;imple and natural &s;tate, if they are the be&s;t nouri&s;hed, and if they enjoy the firme&s;t health and &s;trength, they will there be the mo&s;t fertile in healthy children; but we have no <HI>data</HI> to determine that they will there have the greate&s;t number at one birth.</P>
<P>At the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital, where we have had 18,300 delivered, the proportion of twins born has been only one in 91 births. In the We&s;tmin&s;ter Di&s;pen&s;ary, of 1897 women delivered, the proportion of twins has been once in 80 births; but in the Dublin Lying-in Ho&s;pital, where above 21,000 have been delivered, they have had twins born once every &s;ixty-&s;econd time. The average of which is once in 78 births nearly, in the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>The calculations made in Germany from great numbers, in various &s;ituations, &s;tate twins as happening in a varied propor|tion from once every &s;ixty-fifth to once every &s;eventieth time.</P>
<P>But in a more accurate and later calculation made at Paris, by M. TENON, Surgeon to the Salp&ecirc;triere, we learn, that in 104,591 births the proportion of twins was only one in 96, which is only a &s;mall degree le&s;s than we have calculated at the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>It would be ea&s;y to add other calculations, all differing from the&s;e and from one another, more or le&s;s; but I hope the&s;e are &s;ufficient to &s;hew that nature ob&s;erves no certain rule in this
<PB N="10" REF="9">matter; and that even twins, the mo&s;t u&s;ual variation, is not a very common occurrence.</P>
<P>When we advance to triplets, or three born at once, we find comparatively very few in&s;tances in this or any other country; and though every one has heard of &s;uch events as now and then happening, yet very few have &s;een them.</P>
<P>In all tho&s;e 18,300 women delivered at the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital, there has not been one &s;uch ca&s;e. In the London Lying-in Ho&s;pital, where, being in&s;tituted later, much fewer have been delivered, they have had two &s;uch recorded as prodigies. In the We&s;tmin&s;ter Di&s;pen&s;ary, in 1897 women delivered, there has been but one &s;uch event.</P>
<P>In the Dublin Ho&s;pital, in 21,000 births, they have had triplets born thrice, or once in 7000 times, but have never exceeded that proportion or number, born at one time.</P>
<P>In a pretty exten&s;ive practice of above thirty years, both in the county of Rutland and in London, I have attended but one la|bour where three children were born; am per&s;onally acquainted but with one lady who, at Dumfries, in Scotland, after bearing twins twice, was delivered of three children at once; and I was never acquainted with any one who produced a greater number.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o much does this matter vary at Edinburgh, that Dr. HAMILTON, Profe&s;&s;or of Midwifry, writes, he had &s;een trip|lets born there, five or &s;ix times in le&s;s than twenty-five years.</P>
<P>MAURICEAU, in a long life of very exten&s;ive practice at Paris, with opportunities of knowing mo&s;t things extraordi|nary that happened in his time in France, tells us, he had &s;een triplets born but a few times; had heard of four in that city but once, and mentions no greater number.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance which he relates is &s;o far worthy of atten|tion, as it accords with one &s;omewhat &s;imilar &s;ubjoined to Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="10">HULL's ca&s;e now read, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>"That the hu&s;band of one of tho&s;e women who bore three children was by trade a pain|ter, and had been, for two years preceding this birth, para|lytic over one-half of his body, and yet had no rea&s;on to doubt the fidelity of his wife."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e facts, as far as they are to be depended on, may &s;hew us, that the capacity of procreation in the male may remain under very infirm health; and that we ought to judge with candour of &s;uch wives as are fruitful when living with very ailing hu&s;bands, and who produce healthy children in the eighth, or even ninth, month after their death; as we can never &s;ay determinately under what degree of di&s;ea&s;e the male is totally incapable of procreation: more e&s;pecially as we are very certain, that the female is not, when labouring under very de&s;perate, and certainly fatal, di&s;ea&s;es, provided the prin|cipal organs of generation be &s;ound. Nay, in ca&s;es of pulmo|nary phthi&s;is, the life of the female &s;eems to be protracted by pregnancy; and I have attended a lady, who, after being pronounced irrecoverably hectic, lived long enough to be twice delivered naturally of healthy children at the full time.</P>
<P>But what particular circum&s;tances of con&s;titution, or &s;tate of health, can capacitate the male to become the father of more than one child at a birth, or how this could be effected, &s;hould it be wi&s;hed, remains among tho&s;e &s;ecrets of nature which our want of facts and ob&s;ervations renders us utterly incapable to &s;peculate upon.</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable, and the&s;e two ob&s;ervations, as well as SPALLANZANI's, and other late experiments, would rather incline us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e numerous births do depend mo&s;t on the &s;tructure and &s;tate of the female organs; but
<PB N="12" REF="11">nothing, that I know of, has ever been di&s;covered in this ob&s;cure matter.</P>
<P>The occurrence of four born at once we find to be much more uncommon; and, I think, HALLER's conjecture rather than calculation of its happening once in 20,000 births, very much under-rated, as it appears that once in 100,000 would be much nearer the truth. Of this, however, we have &s;everal well authenticated ca&s;es which have happened in this i&s;land. In the year 1674, there was publi&s;hed in London a quarto pamphlet, intituled, <Q>"The fruitful Wonder, or a &s;trange Re|lation, from King&s;ton upon Thames, of a Woman who, on Thur&s;day and Friday, the Fifth and Sixth Days of this In&s;tant March, 1673-4, was delivered of Four Children at one Birth, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Sons and One Daughter, all born alive, lu&s;ty Children, and perfect in every Part, which lived Twenty-four Hours, and then died, all much about the &s;ame Time, with &s;everal other Examples of numerous Births, from credible Hi&s;torians, with the Phy&s;ical and A&s;tro|logical Rea&s;ons for the &s;ame. By J. P. Student in Phy&s;ic."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. PLOTT, in his Hi&s;tory of Stafford&s;hire, p. 194. men|tions ELEANOR, the wife of HENRY DIVEN, of Watlington, who was delivered of four children at a birth in the year 1675.</P>
<P>Sir ROBERT SIBBALD, in his <HI>Scotia Illu&s;trata,</HI> after men|tioning a ca&s;e of three born at once, adds, <Q>"Imo in variis regni locis repertae &s;unt mulieres quae quatuor foetus uno partu ediderunt;"</Q> but makes no mention of more.</P>
<P>In the Gentleman's Magazine, which is reckoned a pretty authentic record of the times, we have the following accounts of numerous births.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>ANN BOYNTON, of Hen&s;bridge, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, was this day, June 1, 1736, delivered of three daughters and one &s;on; one of the daughters died, the re&s;t are likely to live. The mother has been married but four years, and has had twice twins before, which completes the number of eight children at three births.</P>
<P>October 3, 1743, at Rate, in Berk&s;hire, JOAN GALLO|WAY was delivered of two boys and two girls, three of whom were alive.</P>
<P>In January, 1746, the wife of PLUMER, a labouring man, at Mill-Wimley, near Hitchin, Hertford&s;hire, was delivered of three living boys and one dead.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 22, 1746, the wife of WILLIAMS, of Coventry-&s;treet, Piccadilly, was delivered of two boys and two girls, all likely to live.</P>
<P>June, 1752, a woman in the pari&s;h of Tillicultrie, near Stirling, in Scotland, was delivered of four children, which were all immediately bapti&s;ed, and all died at the &s;ame time next morning.</P>
<P>In September, 1757, a poor woman, of Burton Ferry, Glamorgan&s;hire, was delivered of three boys and a girl.</P>
<P>Dr. HAMILTON before mentioned writes, that, not many years ago, a woman was delivered of our children, at Penny|cuick, the &s;eat of Sir JOHN CLARK, Bart. near Edinburgh, when &s;he was advanced to the middle of her la&s;t month of pregnancy, and that &s;ome of the&s;e children lived two or three years. He further &s;ays, that, five years ago, he attended a woman at Edinburgh, who, in the &s;eventh month of her pregnancy, after a journey of thirty miles, was &s;uddenly deli|vered of four children, all perfect and well grown for the time, of which one was born dead, and three alive; but tho&s;e three
<PB N="14" REF="13">died next day. He further adds, that the&s;e are the only ca&s;es of quadruplets, or any larger number, he had ever heard of, as born in Scotland, in his memory.</P>
<P>Though ca&s;es &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent of five children born at once, are &s;till much more uncommon; and though HALLER's a&s;&s;ertion of their not happening above once in a million of births, may be reckoned a very moderate calculation, yet we are not altogether without &s;uch in&s;tances in this country.</P>
<P>From the Gentleman's Magazine we learn, that on the 5th of October, 1736, a woman at a milk-cellar, in the Strand, was delivered of three boys and two girls at one birth; and that in March, 1739, at Wells, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, a woman was delivered of four &s;ons and a daughter, all alive, all chri&s;tened, and all then &s;eeming likely to live.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Commercium Literarium Norimbergen&s;e</HI> for the year 1731, we have two &s;uch ca&s;es; one happening in Upper Saxony, the other near Prague, in Bohemia; in each of which five children were born and chri&s;tened, all of whom were arrived to that equal degree of maturity, which rendered it probable, they were all conceived about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I learned from two foreign Profe&s;&s;ors, when in London la&s;t winter, that they had each heard of a ca&s;e of five children born near Paris, and near Ghent in Flanders; but the particu|lars not being &s;ent as promi&s;ed, I pre&s;ume they may have been mi&s;informed.</P>
<P>When we advance farther we get into the region of tradi|tion and improbability; and it would ill become me to trouble a Society, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ed object is truth and &s;cience, with the numerous and wonderful relations which many grave and learned authors have recorded as facts they them&s;elves believed; yet I &s;till think we have no authority to reject ab&s;olutely every
<PB N="15" REF="14">relation of this kind, when AMBROSE PAREY, a very hone&s;t though credulous man, tells, that in his time, in the pari&s;h of Sceaux, near Chambellay between Sarte and Maine, the mo|ther of the then living lord of the noble hou&s;e of MALDE|MEURE had, in the fir&s;t year of her marriage, brought forth twins, in the &s;econd triplets, in the third four, in the fourth five, and in the fifth year &s;ix children at one birth, of which labour &s;he died; and when he adds, that of the&s;e <HI>la&s;t &s;ix</HI> one is yet alive, and is now Lord of Maldemeure, how can we di&s;|believe this circum&s;tance? This &s;tory may very po&s;&s;ibly be in|accurately &s;tated, yet the whole cannot be a fiction, as it was publi&s;hed among the very people, and in the age when it hap|pened, and never has been &s;ince contradicted &s;o far as we know. Though the wonderful regularity of the progre&s;s gives an appearance of fable to the whole, yet we mu&s;t believe the thing to be po&s;&s;ible; and that this then exi&s;ting lord might be the only one of the &s;ix who lived long enough to be born at the full time, in a mature &s;tate; the whole, or mo&s;t of the other five, as we have &s;ometimes &s;een in ca&s;es of twins, hav|ing been born as dead abortions, which had never arrived to a bulk &s;ufficient to interfere with his growth.</P>
<P>I leave the learned to pay what degree of credit they plea&s;e to the wonderful relations we read of the extreme fertility of the women of Egypt, Arabia, and other warm countries, as recorded by ARISTOTLE, by PLINY, and by ALBUCASIS, where three, four, five, and &s;ix children are &s;aid to have been fre|quently born at once, and the greate&s;t part of the&s;e reared to maturity; and will only &s;ay, that though a late traveller M. SAVARY gives ample te&s;timony of the extreme general ferti|lity of Egypt in all vegetable and animal productions, and par|ticularly
<PB N="16" REF="15">of its abundant population, he mentions nothing of the numerous births recorded by the ancient naturali&s;ts and hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Of &s;till more fruitful births I will pa&s;s over a number of in|&s;tances which I could adduce from JOHANNES RHODIUS, LUCAS SCHROECKIUS, CASPAR BAUHIN, JOHANNES HELVIGIUS, BIAN|CHI, and others, and fini&s;h with one ca&s;e more, recorded by PETRUS BORELLI in his Second Century of Ob&s;ervations, pub|li&s;hed at Paris in the year 1656; a collection indeed filled with many wonderful &s;tories, though by a man of equal integrity and ingenuity: he tells us, that in the year 1650, ju&s;t five years before, the lady of the then pre&s;ent Lord DARRE produced at one birth eight perfect children, which he owns was a very unu&s;ual event in that country.</P>
<P>I think it totally unnece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue this enquiry farther; but mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the pre&s;ent is the only ca&s;e I have found, where the children were all females; that the males have in all the other ca&s;es been at lea&s;t equal, and generally the mo&s;t numerous; that in many of them, at lea&s;t a part was dead born; and that mo&s;t commonly the re&s;t died in a &s;hort time. It is thence clear, that tho&s;e numerous births are cer|tainly unfavourable to population, as very few indeed of tho&s;e children can be carried to near the full term of pregnancy, and fewer &s;till to that degree of &s;trength that admits of their being reared, where more than two are born at one time.</P>
<P>As from Mr. JOHN HUNTER's very curious Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, read lately to this Society, on the Procreation of Swine, we are led to believe, that a certain determined number of ova, capable of receiving male impregnation, are originally formed in each ovarium; and which number, when exhau&s;ted, the female con&s;titution has no power to renew; if this be the
<PB N="17" REF="16">true account of the oeconomy of nature in this particular, which has every appearance of probability, tho&s;e numerous births mu&s;t occa&s;ion a very fruitle&s;s profu&s;ion and wa&s;te of the human race, and become every way detrimental to its increa&s;e.</P>
<P>From the united te&s;timony of the foregoing ca&s;es, it is undeniably clear, that the females of the human &s;pecies, though mo&s;t commonly uniparous, are, in certain circum&s;tances to us unknown, every now and then capable of very far ex|ceeding their u&s;ual number; and I mu&s;t again repeat, that it does not appear that we can &s;et any bounds to the powers of nature in that re&s;pect; or pretend, as &s;ome have done, with certainty to &s;ay, what may be the utmo&s;t limits of human fertility.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ca&s;e, which made &s;ome noi&s;e in this city, and was publi&s;hed in all the News Paper la&s;t June, as a real in&s;tance of five children produced at one birth, happened too late to find a place in my Paper, and, not being communicated to the Society, could not be in&s;erted in the Tran&s;actions. However, as it was attended with with &s;ome very uncommon circum&s;tances, it appears to be a very proper appendix to tho&s;e copies I have had thrown off to gratify the curio&s;ity of my friends. From this recent in&s;tance which happened under our own eyes as it were, we may be taught with what caution we ought to receive all marvellous reports which the world in
<PB N="18" REF="17">general are ever di&s;po&s;ed to believe and propagate. The rela|tion I &s;ubjoin, I wrote down Thur&s;day June 21, 1787, from the mouth of Mrs. SALTER the midwife, a lodger in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the patient, who then lay dead, at N^o 10, Little Ayliffe-Street, Goodman's-Fields, and was te&s;tified by the hu&s;|band and &s;i&s;ter, who were both pre&s;ent, and certified by Mr. GILSON, of White-Chapel, to be the &s;ame account that was given him by all the people who were in the hou&s;e along with this woman.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH WELLBORN, of Liverpool, was married in September, 1786, to &mdash; FERBER, of Stra&s;burgh, a mariner, being then in her twenty-eighth year. She was very &s;oon &s;eized with all the common &s;ymptoms of beginning pregnancy, only in a more &s;evere degree than mo&s;t women are. She in a &s;hort time became remarkably large, and by degrees &s;o heavy and unwieldy (though a &s;tout and healthy woman before) as with difficulty to be able to &s;upport the burden of her preg|nancy, and under much unea&s;ine&s;s and bad health &s;he dragged on a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing life, till &s;he had completed nine months and four days from her marriage. On Thur&s;day the 7th of June, &s;he was &s;eized with &s;ymptoms of approaching labour which the midwife called fever, continued in that &s;tate all the next day, and on the Saturday morning the labour was thought to have made &s;ome progre&s;s, and the head of a child to be pre|&s;enting in the natural way. This, towards the evening, receded, and the breech of what &s;he imagined to be another child pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, which, after three hours, was delivered by the natural pains at nine o'clock at night, on Saturday the 9th of June, 1787, and proved to be a &s;mall living girl, &s;eemingly at the full time. No placenta followed, and &s;he continued tole|rably ea&s;y till Monday evening the 11th, when &s;he again fell
<PB N="19" REF="18">into labour, and was delivered about twelve at night, fifty-two hours after the birth of the fir&s;t, by the natural pains, of a &s;econd living girl, larger than the former, and a double pla|centa &s;oon followed. She continued unea&s;y all that night, and on Tue&s;day the 12th, at eleven o'clock in the morning (eleven hours after the la&s;t labour), &s;he was delivered of what the midwife called <HI>a fal&s;e conception,</HI> which &s;he de&s;cribes as a large ma&s;s of &s;olid fle&s;h covered with a thick &s;kin, and mea|furing near ten inches in circumference; but in which, when it was cut through the middle and examined, &s;he could not find the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of a foetus. On Wedne&s;day the 13th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, &s;he was delivered by natural pains of a putrid female child, &s;ix inches in length: and on Thur&s;day the 14th, at &s;even o'clock in the morning, ju&s;t &s;ix|teen hours after the birth of the third child, &s;he was delivered of a fourth child, of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize with the third. A double placenta, which &s;eemed to have belonged to the&s;e two la&s;t children, &s;oon followed in a putrid &s;tate. The birth of the&s;e four children was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by all the common &s;ymp|toms of the mo&s;t dangerous &s;pecies of puerperal fever. Mr. GILSON, of Whitechapel, was then called in, and found her in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;ituation. But before Mr. GILSON came, both the placenta and the fal&s;e conception were de&s;troyed, &s;o that we are at a lo&s;s to determine whether this la&s;t was only a mere coagulum of blood conden&s;ed into this form by &s;low extrava&s;ation, and the length of time in which it had under|gone the compre&s;&s;ing action of the uterus; or whether it was the increa&s;ed &s;ecundines of a real fifth conception, where the foetus had died &s;o early as to be totally di&s;&s;olved, and &s;o mixed with the coagulated ma&s;s as not to be di&s;covered by a mid|wife, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to determine
<PB N="20" REF="19">preci&s;ely what the nature of this &s;ub&s;tance was. But it has been repeatedly a&s;certained, that all mola's, or what are vul|garly called fal&s;e conceptions, are either the one or the other.</P>
<P>This poor woman gradually grew wor&s;e; and on the Saturday the 16th &s;he was &s;eized with convul&s;ions, and on Sunday the 17th of June, in the evening at half pa&s;t ten, &s;he died, being the fourth day after the delivery of the fourth child, and the ele|venth after that of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t-born children &s;eem healthy and promi&s;ing, are put to a &s;uckling nur&s;e, and are of the common &s;ize of &s;mall twins. The elde&s;t weighed in her cloaths four pounds and one quarter, and the younger &s;carcely four pounds; both together barely the weight of a common full grown mature foetus.</P>
<P>I add the following quotations from reputable authors, with|out pretending to &s;ay, whether any degree of credit ought to be given to them or not.</P>
<P>CHAMBON DE MONTAUX<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maladie de Gro&s;&s;e&s;&s;a, tom. ii. p. 367.</NOTE> quotes a letter, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Journal de Savans,</HI> from M. SEIGNETTE, Phy&s;ician at Ro|chelle, to M. LEMERY, in which he mentions a woman of Saintonge, who was, at one birth, delivered of nine well|formed children, &s;o far advanced that their &s;exes could be ea&s;ily di&s;covered. And J. B. BIANCHI<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Naturali in Humano Corpore vitio&s;a Morbo&s;aque Generatione Hi&s;toria Aug. Tauri. 1741, p. 249.</NOTE>, an author of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="21" REF="20">reputation for candour and accuracy, tells us, that in his time, in the city of Turin, three children at one birth had happened more than once; that in &s;ome of the di&s;tricts of Piedmont there had been &s;ometimes five; and that in the Dutchy of Milan, a very little time preceding the year 1741, when he publi&s;hed, &s;even had been born at one time; and he adds the following very extraordinary hi&s;tory, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be well authenticated, as he received it from M. P. R. DAVID, a very re&s;pectable Clergyman and Dean of the Chapel of the Academy of Turin, <Q>"That, fourteen years before this, M. DAVID had met and conver&s;ed with a woman, who&s;e hi&s;tory he had frequently before heard, who a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he her|&s;elf had, at one very painful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing labour, produced in a &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;even living and healthy children of different &s;exes;"</Q> and that one of the&s;e children, then a boy of eleven or twelve years of age, was pre&s;ent with his mother when &s;he told him the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Of fruitful females we have the following hi&s;tory in the Harlem Courant for 1755. A man was pre&s;ented to the Em|pre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, remarkable for being the father of &s;eventy-two children, born to him by two wives. The fir&s;t had four chil|dren at a birth four times; &s;he next produced three at a birth &s;even times, and afterwards twins ten times, in all amounting to fifty-&s;even children by one wife. The &s;econd, after bearing three &s;ingle children, had twins &s;ix times, amounting to fif|teen; and the two together to &s;eventy-two.</P>
<P>The daughter of GERARD VANDERGUICHT, Engraver to Sir HANS SLOANE, confirmed lately to Dr. COMBE, a fact he had often heard in his own family, that her mother, who is now alive and in her eighty-&s;ixth year, had, during her marriage with the &s;aid VANDERGUICHT, borne thirty-two children at
<PB N="22" REF="21">one and thirty births, the la&s;t being twins; and that they all lived to be chri&s;tened.</P>
<P>Mr. KIRWAN, a very re&s;pectable philo&s;opher, and Fellow of the Royal Society, has often told me, that he had con|ver&s;ed with a gentleman, who affirmed to him, that he him|&s;elf was the younge&s;t but one of forty &s;ons, all produced in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from three different wives, by one father, in Ireland, and who all arrived at the age of manhood; and Mr. KIRWAN often declared, he had no rea&s;on to doubt the truth of this relation.</P>
<P>As it is more than probable, that a number of facts, &s;imilar to the&s;e, may have taken place in &s;ituations where no public notice has been taken of them, the pre&s;ent communication may, perhaps, &s;timulate &s;ome to make known to the Royal Society, any remarkable and well authenticated phaenomena of this kind, which either have already happened, or may in future.</P>
