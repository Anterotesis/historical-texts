<HEAD>An <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> of the <HI>CONTRIBUTION</HI> for making Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s <HI>MEDICINES</HI> public; with &s;ome <HI>REASONS</HI> for it, and <HI>ANSWERS</HI> to the mo&s;t Remarkable <HI>Objections</HI> made again&s;t it.</HEAD>
<P>_THE fal&s;e Pretences to Methods of di&s;&s;olving Stones in the Uri|nary Pa&s;&s;ages have been &s;o many, and &s;ome of them &s;o pernicious, that Phy&s;icians of Character and Experience &s;eem for &s;ome time to have left off enquiring into the Nature and Efficacy of Medicines &s;aid to di&s;&s;olve Stones; contenting them&s;elves with pre&s;cribing opiate and lenient Remedies, where the Stones were &s;uppo&s;ed too large to pa&s;s; or advi&s;ing the Operation for tho&s;e in the Bladder, if the Age, Strength and other Circum&s;tances of the Patient made it proper to be attempted. But &s;till the thing is not impo&s;&s;ible; the active Principles di&s;|covered in Stones have always afforded &s;ome Hopes to the careful Enquirers into Nature, that a &s;afe Di&s;&s;olvent might at la&s;t be found; and, what is above all, Matters of Fact may ju&s;tly claim a fair Hearing, e&s;pecially in a Ca&s;e of great Import|ance. In order to obtain this for Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, I &s;ome time ago publi&s;hed a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>Ten Ca&s;es of Per&s;ons who have taken Mrs.</HI> Stephens<HI>'s Medicines for the Stone; with an Ab&s;tract of &s;ome Experiments, tending to illu&s;trate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;e Ca&s;es.</HI> Since this a Contribution has been begun, and is now carried on at Mr. <HI>Drummond</HI>'s, Banker at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s,</HI> for the rai&s;ing 5000<HI>l.</HI> in order to purcha&s;e the Secret from Mrs. <HI>Stephens;</HI> and his Grace the Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> Lord Privy Seal; his Grace the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Lenox;</HI> his Grace the Duke of <HI>Montague;</HI> the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Pembroke;</HI> the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Scarborough;</HI> the Right Honourable the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Lon&s;dale;</HI> the Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> the Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Right Honourable the Lord <HI>Baltimore;</HI> the Right Honourable <HI>Arthur On&s;low,</HI> E&s;q; Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons; the Right Honour|able <HI>Stephen Poyntz,</HI> E&s;q; and the Honourable <HI>Thomas Town&s;hend,</HI> E&s;q; have con&s;ented to become Tru&s;tees and Judges between the Public and Mrs. <HI>Stephens,</HI> and have taken Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> and My&s;elf into their Number. Every 1000<HI>l.</HI> as it ari&s;es, is to be ve&s;ted in <HI>South Sea</HI> Annuities, in the Names of the Tru&s;tees, and when the 5000<HI>l.</HI> is completed, Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> will di&s;cover her Me|dicines. They will then be made public, and tried in the Ho&s;pitals, in the mo&s;t &s;trict and authentic manner, upon Per&s;ons who are to be examined by the Catheter both before and after taking them. She is to have the Intere&s;t of the 5000<HI>l.</HI> from the time of di&s;covering her Medicines, in Con&s;ideration of the great Profits which &s;he forfeits by di&s;covering them; and the Principal it&s;elf, whenever it &s;hall appear to the Tru&s;tees, or a Majority of them, that her Medicines are able to di&s;&s;olve Stones in the Blad|der; but if this does not appear, the Principal will be returned to the Contributors. The&s;e are the Propo&s;als which appeared mo&s;t rea&s;onable and practicable to the Gentlemen whom I con&s;ulted in this Affair; and I beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure the Public, that had I known a better Scheme, I &s;hould have embraced it with &s;till more Readine&s;s; but I hope, &s;mall Difficulties and Objections will be over|looked, and I &s;hall now endeavour, in the be&s;t manner I can, to remove all &s;uch con&s;iderable ones as I have heard mentioned, giving fir&s;t &s;ome Rea&s;ons, which &s;eem to me to render the pre&s;ent Propo&s;als worthy of the Encouragement of all generous Minds.</P>
<P>It has been a prevailing Notion, that Stones of the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages cannot be di&s;&s;olved by any Liquid, except &s;uch as is too acrimonious for the Pa&s;&s;ages them&s;elves. But this is plainly a Mi&s;take. For Mon&s;ieur <HI>Littre,</HI> a Member of the Royal Aca|demy of Sciences at <HI>Paris,</HI> found, that the com|mon Waters of <HI>Paris,</HI> one of which leaves great Incru&s;tations upon the Pipes thro' which it runs, di&s;&s;olved Stones, even without Heat; and there is an Account of his Experiments in the Memoirs of that Academy for the Year 1720. Dr. <HI>Hales</HI> al&s;o wa&s;ted &s;everal Gravel-&s;tones both in warm and cold Water, and found, that <Q>"tho&s;e in warm Water di&s;&s;olved much &s;ooner than the other."</Q> <HI>Hoema&s;taticks,</HI> p. 216. And it appears by the Ex|periments which I have publi&s;hed, that <HI>Thames</HI> Water, <HI>New River</HI> Water, and <HI>Pump</HI> Water are all able to di&s;&s;olve a great Variety of Stones, by barely &s;uffering the Stones to lie in them, in a Heat equal to that of Urine in the Bladder. The Stones I made u&s;e of were taken from the human Bladder, &s;ome of them were exremely hard, they were of different Sizes, the bigge&s;t weighing about half an Ounce, and wa&s;ted away entirely. There &s;eem therefore to be in Stones them&s;elves &s;ome Prin|ciples, which have a great Tendency to Putre|faction and Di&s;&s;olution, &s;ince the&s;e Effects are pro|duced upon them by mere Water only, either cold or moderately warm. And to &s;ay that an acrimo|nious Liquid is nece&s;&s;ary for this Purpo&s;e, is a ha&s;ty A&s;&s;ertion, contrary to the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t obvious Experiments.</P>
<P>However, this does not come home to the Point. Tho' a Rill of warm Water pa&s;&s;ing thro' the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages would indeed wa&s;te all the Stones lying in them by Degrees, yet this is what no Art can procure. The great Que&s;tion is, Whe|ther Urine, which naturally increa&s;es Stones, as appears by the daily Experience of tho&s;e unhappy Per&s;ons who are afflicted with the Stone, can be &s;o changed by any Medicines, as to di&s;&s;olve Stones in the &s;ame manner as common Water has been &s;hewn to do. In order to determine this Point, I tried what Effect my own Urine, altered by taking the Medicines, would have upon a Variety of Stones taken from the human Bladder, in a Heat equal to that of Urine in the Bladder; and found, that they were di&s;&s;olved entirely by lying in it, much in the &s;ame manner as the corre&s;ponding Pieces in common Water; and at the &s;ame time that other corre&s;ponding Pieces were increa&s;ed by lying in common Urine with the &s;ame Heat. Af|terwards I tried the Urine of another Per&s;on who took Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, and found that it had the &s;ame di&s;&s;olving Power as mine, or rather, as I gue&s;&s;ed, one &s;omething greater; &s;o that tho&s;e who take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines have evidently a Liquid running thro' the urinary Pa&s;&s;ages, which is a Solvent for Stones in a Heat no greater than that of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages. And this is &s;uch a Pre|&s;umption in Favour of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, as few others can pretend to from Theory.</P>
<P>It will probably afford &s;ome Satisfaction to mention what Alterations the Urine receives from the&s;e Medicines. The&s;e are a volatile putrid Smell;
<PB N="2" REF="2">a turbid and milky Appearance at the time of making; a copious white Sediment, by the falling of which the Urine becomes clear, and which may be dried into a chalky Sub&s;tance; and an alkaline Quality, as appears by Trials both with the mi|neral and vegetable Acids, and al&s;o with Syrup of Violets. Now it is not at all improbable, that Urine with the&s;e Properties &s;hould fir&s;t lo&s;e its ce|menting, accreting Power, and then render the Stones, which lie in it, rotten by Degrees. For common Urine, when it putrefies, di&s;&s;olves its own Gravel; Wine in corrupting di&s;&s;olves its own Tartar; and the mineral Waters, as Dr. <HI>Hales</HI> has a&s;&s;ured me, take up their own Sediment, after they have been putrefied for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>But what will and ought to weigh mo&s;t with every Body is, that many Per&s;ons, who have had all the Symptoms of Stones in the Kidneys and Bladder, have taken the&s;e Medicines, voided much Grit, with many plain Scales and Pieces of Stone, have become free from all their Complaints, and continued &s;o. Now tho' it happens, that many Per&s;ons who have the Stone void Pieces without taking any Medicines, yet the&s;e Pieces are gene|rally few in Number, hard when voided, and the Per&s;ons them&s;elves continue to have the &s;ame Complaints, becau&s;e the main Body of the Stone &s;till remains; whereas the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e who take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines regularly, hav|ing the true Symptoms of the Stone, void either Grit, or Scales, or Fragments of Stone, or all, in great Quantities, and continue to do &s;o, till they are freed from their Symptoms; that is, as one may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, from the great Quantities voided, till the Stone be quite wa&s;ted. This is a con&s;tant regular Effect, like tho&s;e of the principal Medicines u&s;ed in Phy&s;ic, all which fail &s;ometimes thro' the Irregularity or particular Con&s;titution of the Patient, and always require a different Do&s;e, a different Time for taking Effect, or a peculiar Accommodation, according to the Nature of the Ca&s;e. Let the&s;e common equitable Allowances be made to Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, and the Ca&s;es of tho&s;e who have taken them will prove their di&s;&s;olving Power as &s;trongly, as the Virtue of any other Medicine can be proved by a like Number of Ca&s;es, taken with the &s;ame Advantages and Di&s;advantages; and without doubt this di&s;&s;olving Power in them will be no more que&s;tioned &s;ome Years hence, than the anodyne Quality of Opium is now.</P>
<P>I publi&s;hed Ten Ca&s;es, but there are many more of the &s;ame kind, which I have either &s;een, or been well informed about. Each of the&s;e, &s;ingly taken, favours the di&s;&s;olving Power of the Medi|cines; Three or Four taken together become a &s;trong Pre&s;umption; but the united Force of the whole cannot be thought le&s;s than a full Proof, by tho&s;e who know them accurately. It mu&s;t not be expected, that the&s;e Medicines &s;hould cure every one who takes them; &s;ome cannot take them regu|larly, &s;ome are negligent, and &s;ome have their Kidneys in great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed, or labour under incurable Di&s;tempers of another kind; and be&s;ides this, &s;ome Stones may perhaps be too hard to be affected by them; but if they will di&s;&s;olve only the greate&s;t Part of the Stones of the Kidneys and Bladder, they are worthy of all Encourage|ment; and the Evidence for this is as great as can any way be expected. A Medicine which did really di&s;&s;olve far the greate&s;t Part of the Stones of the Kidneys and Bladder, need not have given greater Proofs of it in the &s;ame Number of Trials. Nothing more could be expected from &s;uch a Me|dicine, but that Scales and broken Pieces of Stone of various Shapes and Sizes, &s;hould be voided after taking it, in &s;o &s;oft or rotten a State, as to &s;hew plain Marks of Di&s;&s;olution, till at la&s;t the Patient was freed from his Complaints. And this is the ge|neral Ca&s;e here. The Scales and Pieces voided are of all Sizes capable of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Urethra,</HI> every way irregular in their Shapes, for the mo&s;t part &s;oft, or at lea&s;t &s;o rotten, as to crumble ea&s;ily, have their Surfaces white, and often honey-comb'd; and, in &s;hort, all Appearances an&s;wer to the Expe|riments made upon the Stones with my Urine, and that of the other Per&s;on who took the Medicines. And be&s;ides this, there is one Evidence from the Examination by the Catheter, as &s;trong as a &s;ingle one can well be. Mr. <HI>Holland,</HI> Warder of the Tower, had the Symptoms of a Stone in the Blad|der for Three Years, and was examined in <HI>No|vember</HI> la&s;t by Mr. <HI>Hawkins;</HI> Governor <HI>William|&s;on,</HI> Dr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> and my&s;elf being pre&s;ent. We all felt a Stone. He took the Medicines, voided many Scales and Pieces of Stone, with an entire one, as large as could well pa&s;s, and grew free from all his Complaints, tho' he was driven over the Stones in a Hackney Coach with the utmo&s;t Vio|lence. On the 19th of la&s;t Month he was exa|mined again by Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of Dr. <HI>Sandys,</HI> Dr. <HI>Shaw,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> when a Catheter was introduced three different times, and he was put into different Po&s;tures, but no Stone could be found. And there are &s;everal others, who having been found to have Stones in the Bladder by the Catheter, take the Medicines, void Pieces, and are expected to be well &s;hortly.</P>
<P>This is in general the Evidence for the di&s;&s;olv|ing Power of the&s;e Medicines, and I cannot &s;ee what is to be &s;aid again&s;t it; but indeed I do not know that any thing is &s;aid again&s;t it by tho&s;e who are well informed of the Facts. However, it is not intended to do more by this Evidence, than &s;o far to engage the Attention and Favour of the World, as to rai&s;e the 5000<HI>l.</HI> and have the Medicines made public. This is de&s;irable without doubt, becau&s;e they have plainly done mo&s;t eminent Service in many terrible Kidney and Bladder Ca&s;es, where the common Practice could do nothing, whether they di&s;&s;olve Stones or no. But Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> is &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of their di&s;&s;olving Power, that &s;he puts all upon that Foundation, and particularly upon their di&s;&s;olving Stones in the Bladder, &s;ince this admits of the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Evidence; &s;he is content to be entirely without the Reward, if this Fact be not proved to a Majority of the Tru|&s;tees: She is willing and de&s;irous, that as many Pa|tients as the Tru&s;tees &s;hall think fit, be put into any or all of the Ho&s;pitals, that they be examined by the Catheter in the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t public man|ner; and if this Evidence does not an&s;wer, &s;he gives up all Title to the Reward, and each Con|tributor will have his Contribution returned. Now upon the&s;e Conditions, e&s;pecially where there are &s;uch unque&s;tionable Judges, a &s;lender Probability &s;eems &s;ufficient Foundation for a Contribution; nay, it would not be very improper, if there were no Probability at all; for this would at lea&s;t be a means of detecting a Pretence which has impo&s;ed upon many Gentlemen of Worth and Knowledge in other Matters; and if there be no Remedy but the Operation, it is better that this be had early, while the Parts are &s;ound, and the Strength entire.</P>
<P>I will now con&s;ider the mo&s;t remarkable Difficul|ties and Objections which I have heard mentioned.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That a Trial of the&s;e Medicines by the Catheter ought to have been made in the Ho|&s;pitals before the Contribution was propo&s;ed. But there are &s;everal Inconveniencies attending this Method of proceeding. Fir&s;t, Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> has already more Per&s;ons who take her Medicines than &s;he can make up for con&s;i&s;tently with her own Health, and it would be very hard to leave any of
<PB N="3" REF="3">the&s;e, in order to make up for the Ho&s;pitals, as every body would think in their own Ca&s;e. Se|condly, When it was proved in this way, that Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines were able to di&s;&s;olve Stones in the Bladder, there would be a Nece&s;&s;ity for another Trial, to know, whether &s;he commu|nicated the&s;e Medicines faithfully; whereas, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent Propo&s;als, &s;he will have no Reward unle&s;s &s;he communicates a Medicine able to di&s;&s;olve Stones in the Bladder. Thirdly, There are in all Parts of the World many unhappy Per|&s;ons, either dying or living in Pain, thro' the Cru|elty of this Di&s;temper, who&s;e Mi&s;ery calls for the mo&s;t &s;peedy Relief; &s;o that if the&s;e Medicines &s;hould be effectual, their Publication ought not to be deferred a Moment longer than nece&s;&s;ary. But it would be a con&s;iderable Time before the few Trials to be made of the&s;e Medicines, while kept &s;ecret, could determine either way; and this was the principal Rea&s;on for contriving a Method, which admitted of an immediate Publication. La&s;tly, The greater Number of Trials made when the Medicines are known to the World, will render the Judgment formed upon them much more &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That there is no Stre&s;s to be laid upon what is voided, becau&s;e any one would do the &s;ame upon taking the Medicines, whether he had a Stone or no. But this Objection will vani&s;h upon a due Attention to the Facts. For the Per&s;ons who take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines void Pieces of Stone, as evidently &s;uch, as if a Stone was broke in a Mor|tar into Pieces of all Sizes capable of pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Urethra.</HI> As to the Sediment which falls to the Bottom of the Urine, it may perhaps be in great mea&s;ure the Effect of the Medicines, but there is no Evidence that it does not al&s;o contain Stone, becau&s;e no body cares to take the Medicines without fir&s;t being apprehen&s;ive at lea&s;t that he has a Stone. On the contrary, it is probable, that &s;ome Part of this Sediment is Stone in an impalpable Form; for if the Stone come away in large Pieces, it may much rather be voided in an impalpable Powder from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, whatever it be; and many of the Stones in my Experiments had a white powdery Sub&s;tance upon their Surfaces, that might be rubbed off with the Finger; which has al&s;o been the Ca&s;e with &s;ome Pieces of Stone that have been voided.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the&s;e Medicines are nothing more than Soap. That Soap is one Part is very plain, but it is as plain, that there is another Part which is not Soap. Be&s;ides, Soap will not di&s;&s;olve Stones, and if it would, this would be the Inven|tion of Mrs. <HI>Stephens,</HI> for which &s;he de&s;erves the &s;ame Reward as for inventing any other Solvent.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the&s;e Medicines may probably force Grit and Gravel from the Kidneys, and pre|vent the Growth of Stones, but cannot di&s;&s;olve Stones in the Bladder. But this Objection will al&s;o vani&s;h upon a due Attention to the Facts. Mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons who&s;e Ca&s;es I publi&s;hed, had the plain|e&s;t Symptoms of Stones in the Bladder. And &s;eve|ral of the&s;e, with many others, have voided Pieces too large to pa&s;s the <HI>Ureters</HI> without Pain, and which accordingly have given Pain in pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Urethra,</HI> who yet had no previous Pains in the Region of the Kidneys or Ureters. The Medi|cines are indeed Diuretic, but not more &s;o than many others in common U&s;e, and therefore their good Effects mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome other Property.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the Medicines are certainly good in Bladder Ca&s;es, and have done much Ser|vice, but that their di&s;&s;olving Power may &s;till be que&s;tioned. Be it &s;o. However, &s;ince they have done much Service in Bladder Ca&s;es, where large Pieces of Stone have been voided, as was &s;aid in the la&s;t Paragraph, the&s;e Bladder Ca&s;es mu&s;t have been Stones in the Bladder; and a Medicine which does Service in Stones of the Bladder, by making the Per&s;on void Pieces, and grow free from his Complaints at la&s;t, bids fair for a Solvent.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the Medicines are nau&s;eous, oc|ca&s;ion great Pains, and are attended with Danger. That they are very nau&s;eous is certain; the In|crea&s;e of Pain is al&s;o &s;ometimes very con&s;iderable, but then it is generally of &s;hort Continuance; and they may be, and I believe are, dangerous, with|out proper Care and due Regulations; yet with the&s;e I &s;ee no Danger. And the Public may be a&s;|&s;ured, that I, who have taken them con&s;tantly for a Year, cannot but have enquired very &s;trictly in|to this Matter. The &s;ame Objections may be made to many of the be&s;t Medicines in daily U&s;e; which would be unan&s;werable, did not the Care and Skill of Phy&s;icians remove them, or the Pain and Danger attending Di&s;tempers over-rule them. And in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e one may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that Phy&s;icians will make great Improvements in the manner of giving the&s;e Medicines; and if they do not, the Medicines, upon the wor&s;t Suppo&s;ition, are &s;till far preferable either to the Stone, or the Operation of Cutting. I ought however to ob|&s;erve, in Ju&s;tice to Mrs. <HI>Stephens,</HI> that her manner of proceeding is in general very careful and ratio|nal, and that &s;he &s;uffers much from the Negli|gence and Irregularity of tho&s;e who take her Me|dicines; which Phy&s;icians know to be often their own Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That many Per&s;ons who have the Stone, grow ea&s;y without any vi&s;ible Rea&s;on. However, this is very rare; and the&s;e Medicines, which are Diuretic, and occa&s;ion Pain at fir&s;t, are very unlikely to be Palliatives, or even to permit a Per&s;on to be ea&s;y till the Cau&s;e be removed.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the Sum of 5000<HI>l.</HI> is too large. But by what Rule of E&s;timation &s;hall one deter|mine this Matter? If we &s;peak &s;trictly, and accord|ing to the Obligations which we are all under to con|&s;ult public Happine&s;s at all Events, I &s;uppo&s;e nei|ther Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> nor any one el&s;e is &s;o generous and di&s;intere&s;ted as the&s;e Obligations require. However, in common Language, Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> has a Right to her own Secret, and may &s;et what Price &s;he plea&s;es upon it, e&s;pecially if it be no more than what &s;he may rea&s;onably hope to make of it in another way. And the thing it&s;elf, if it be a Solvent for the Stone, is &s;urely of more Import|ance to Mankind than 5000<HI>l.</HI> can be of to the Contributors.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That this will encourage Quacks. I believe not. There are few Quacks who will venture to appeal to &s;uch Judges, and to &s;uch a Method of Examination.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That the mo&s;t eminent Gentlemen of the Faculty ought to have been made Judges. This is very true; and one of the fir&s;t Steps which I took was, to de&s;ire tho&s;e to whom I had the Ho|nour to be be&s;t known, to become Judges in the Affair; but they declined it. However, I beg of them once more to attend to the Facts; and, if they plea&s;e, to contribute, becau&s;e this would &s;oon bring the Matter to a Trial. And I need not &s;ay, that their Judgment will have the greate&s;t Weight as well with the Tru&s;tees, as with every body el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That I ought to have publi&s;hed all the Failures and ill Accidents as well as the Ten Ca&s;es, which favour the di&s;&s;olving Power of the Medicines. But I have met with nothing of this kind &s;ufficient to render the Medicines &s;u&s;pected either of being ineffectual or pernicious. And the full Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Medicines, with all their U&s;es, Defects and Cautions, is more than I have had Opportunity to obtain, but may ea&s;ily be
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">procured from the Trials which will be made of them in the Ho&s;pitals and other Places before the Reward be a&s;&s;igned. I have omitted many more Ca&s;es in Favour of the Medicines than I have given, and it is a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for a farther Trial of them, that &s;o many Per&s;ons have received Benefit from them, and &s;o few Harm.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, That I my&s;elf have received no Be|nefit. My Ca&s;e is in &s;hort this: I have the Symptoms of a Stone or Gravel in both Kidneys, and of a Stone in the Bladder, having Pain in both Sides now and then; Pain at the Neck of the Bladder, in the <HI>Urethra</HI> and <HI>Glans;</HI> Pain and Difficulty in making Water; a &s;udden Stoppage frequently; and I make bloody Water upon Mo|tion. I have been examined twice, but no Stone could be found. However, &s;ince my taking the&s;e Medicines I have voided, and do &s;till void, little angular Bits of Stone very frequently; and in &s;o &s;oft a State as to crumble ea&s;ily. And as I had no con&s;iderable Pain before I began the Medicines, except upon Motion, &s;o I &s;till am ea&s;y while at Re&s;t. The Medicines agree extremely well with my general Health; and as it &s;eems to me, both that I have a Quantity of Stone &s;omewhere in the Pa&s;&s;ages, and al&s;o that this is coming away gradu|ally, tho' very &s;lowly, I go on with the Medicines, hoping that they will at la&s;t be effectual, and not knowing what el&s;e to do. And it would be very unrea&s;onable in me to conceal a Medicine of great Importance to Mankind, becau&s;e I my&s;elf have as yet received no Benefit from it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with begging the Favour of all tho&s;e who have a compa&s;&s;ionate Sen&s;e of the Mi|&s;ery of others, to be &s;o good as to pay in their Contributions of them&s;elves, and without Delay. This may be done in the Country by &s;ending them to the Po&s;tma&s;ter of any neighbouring Town, who will remit them, with the Names of each Contri|butor, to Mr. <HI>Drummond.</HI> It may be done in <HI>London,</HI> by &s;ending a Servant to Mr. <HI>Drummond</HI>'s at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s;</HI> and Care will be taken to have Li&s;ts of the Contributors printed from time to time, for the Satisfaction of the Public. There is now upwards of 900<HI>l.</HI> paid in, and in a great Variety of Sums, from 5<HI>s.</HI> to 100<HI>l.</HI></P>
