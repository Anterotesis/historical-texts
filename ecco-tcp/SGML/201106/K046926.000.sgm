<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is now upwards of Four Years &s;ince the following Sheets were fini&s;h'd, and ju&s;t going to the Pre&s;s, when a tedious Sick|ne&s;s of a dear Relation, which at la&s;t ended in Death, inter|po&s;ed, and not only for that time &s;u&s;pended my Thoughts of publi&s;hing them then, but even extingui&s;h'd my Intentions of ever doing it at all. This I thought nece&s;&s;ary to pre|mi&s;e, that what may be found either in the Body, or Hi&s;torical Accounts of the follow|ing Di&s;cour&s;e, may not be &s;uppo&s;ed in any way to relate to the Contentions which have ari&s;en between &s;ome eminent Practi&s;ers, con|cerning Purging in the Declen&s;ion of the Small Pox; but whatever is there, I look upon
<PB N="ij" REF="4">my &s;elf to be an&s;werable for, whither Bad or Good.</P>
<P>For as on one Hand, it would be an inex|cu&s;able Partiality and Peevi&s;hne&s;s, to find fault with any Di&s;covery, that may be made in Practice upon &s;o difficult a Di&s;ea&s;e as the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> frequently proves to be, in as much, as by &s;uch Sugge&s;tion, &s;ick Per&s;ons, or tho&s;e about them, may be deterred from ma|king u&s;e of &s;uch Things as may be &s;er|viceable and in&s;trumental towards the &s;aving their Lives: So would it be as unpardonable a Levity on the other Hand, for any one to depart from a Method he had found &s;uc|ce&s;sful, with very little Interruption, in a Di&s;ea&s;e under its general De&s;ignation; and without any at all, when &s;o particularly circum&s;tantiated as the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is in Wo|men with Child; which has been always look'd on as a &s;ingular Di&s;advantage to Per|&s;ons labouring under it at that time.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t In&s;tances the Learned Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> gives in his Treati&s;e, <HI>de Purga|tione in &s;ecunda fibre,</HI> &amp;c. is of a Per&s;on that mi&s;carried; upon which Account he con|&s;ulted with the celebrated Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI> who&s;e peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t frequently lead him into Ob&s;ervations of that kind more than any others; and as the Ca&s;e is very extra|ordinary in all its Particulars, Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> clo&s;es the Relation after this Manner; That the learned Gentleman he con&s;ulted with, a&s;|&s;ur'd
<PB N="iij" REF="5">&s;ur'd him, that 'twas one of the fir&s;t Pati|ents he ever knew recover under tho&s;e Di&s;|advantages. And indeed, In&s;tances of &s;uch Succe&s;s have been very rare. Which very Ob&s;ervation, well reflected on, &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies and vindicates any Regular and Ra|tional Attempt (and &s;uch I hope the fol|lowing will appear to be) that may be made to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the tender Sex being reduc'd to &s;uch an unhappy Condition and Di|lemma. For by Abortion, the Life of the Child is certainly de&s;troy'd, and at the &s;ame time, and on the &s;ame Account (let others &s;ay what they plea&s;e) that of the Mother is brought into the utmo&s;t Jeopardy. And as the fir&s;t can be &s;aved by no other Means than by preventing the Mi&s;carriage: So is the la&s;t in the mo&s;t probable way of being pre&s;erv'd by the &s;ame Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t laid the&s;e few Ob&s;ervations before the very learned Dr. <HI>Bateman,</HI> the then Pre&s;ident of the College of Phy&s;icians, he was plea&s;ed to encourage my publi&s;hing them in the following Terms.</P>
<P><Q><HI>"Your Treati&s;e of the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>de&s;erves highly to be publi&s;hed, not only for the Hi&s;tories you give of the good Succe&s;s of your Powder; but e&s;pecially for the Ca&s;es of the Women, which is quite new. I thank you al&s;o for the rare U&s;e of Bli|&s;ters, in Ca&s;e of</HI> Haemorrhages, <HI>which I never heard of before,</HI> &amp;c."</Q></P>
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
<P>So kind an Approbation, and from &s;o great a Hand, is &s;ufficient to encourage my Publi&s;hing it at this time, had I no other; but when I have, through God's Ble&s;&s;ing, met with the &s;ame Succe&s;s here in <HI>London</HI> as in the <HI>Country;</HI> and at the &s;ame time look back upon the two la&s;t Years Bills of Mor|tality, and &s;ee &s;o va&s;t a Number of Per&s;ons carried off by the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and the Week|ly Bills &s;till continuing in that Article not low: I need make no Excu&s;e &s;urely, if I endeavour to give a helping Hand in &s;o great a Calamity.</P>
<P>The Manner of treating Women with Child in the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> is as the foremen|tion'd Learned Gentleman does me the Ho|nour to a&s;&s;ure the World, quite new. And yet I will take the liberty at the &s;ame time to affirm, that the Practice is founded upon Rea&s;on and Truth in the natural Di&s;po&s;ition, Admini&s;tration and Function of the Parts during the time of their being &s;o, which is indeed undeniable. By this Te&s;t all former Practice ought to be examin'd, and upon this Foundation all new Di&s;coveries in Medicine ought to be laid. And if upon &s;uch Prin|ciples and Con&s;iderations, Succe&s;s has con|&s;tantly attended the Practice, what more can be de&s;ir'd? And it will not certainly be taken for a precarious Way of proceeding, to pre|&s;ume, that &s;ome of the Thou&s;ands that were &s;wept away by the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> the two
<PB N="v" REF="7">la&s;t Years, might be Women with Child; and the being in&s;trumental in the &s;aving but one Life, will abundantly ju&s;tify the pre&s;ent Work; which common Humanity obliges eve|ry one to confe&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the Powder here propo&s;ed, I mu&s;t freely acknowledge, that it chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch Parts as are well and commonly known in U&s;e and Practice. But the manner of its Compo&s;ition is &s;omewhat new; and then as to the Salt of <HI>Amber,</HI> being directed as an Alexipharmick, (and it is certainly the noble&s;t and mo&s;t generous one in the whole Pharmaceutick Kind) that I think is al&s;o &s;omething new. But that I might neither impo&s;e upon my &s;elf nor my Readers, I have again and again review'd the whole <HI>Materia</HI> of Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> Dr. <HI>Morton,</HI> and others, and cannot once find it admini&s;tred as &s;uch; which has been Matter of greater Wonder than Plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve. I could willingly enter into a long Account of its Excellency, and a Rationale of its Operation; but I &s;hall abridge my &s;elf of that Plea&s;ure, and in few Words only &s;ay, That though it be rec|koned among the Volatile Salts, yet as it va&s;tly excells any of them in its Effects, it great|ly differs from them in its very Nature. Mo&s;t, if not all the other, have a Burning Can&s;tick Quality in them, as is evident in <HI>Sal volat. Corn. Cerv. Cranij, vel o&s;&s;ium Humanorum.</HI> And all Sorts of Volatile Salts of Bones and
<PB N="vj" REF="8">Bone-like Sub&s;tances, or tho&s;e &s;ublim'd from other &s;aline Bodies, as <HI>Sal Salis Armon. Sal Urinae,</HI> &amp;c. and even <HI>Sal Viperarum,</HI> is not much cooler. This any one may &s;atisfy him|&s;elf in, who will but venture to ta&s;t them naked as they are. And mu&s;t con&s;equently create a Thir&s;t, and are hardly in any Ve|hicle po&s;&s;ible to be reconcil'd to the Ta&s;te or Stomach. But <HI>Sal Succini</HI> is really almo&s;t as cool as the mo&s;t natural Elemental Salt, and even extingui&s;hes Feveri&s;h Heats. In &s;hort, it is <HI>Alexipharmick,</HI> as it is an excel|lent Counterpoi&s;on; it is <HI>Cephalick,</HI> greatly relieving the Head, and the whole Nervous kind, and wonderfully reviving the Spirits at the &s;ame Time: It is <HI>Diuretick</HI> and <HI>Dia|phoretick,</HI> in its provoking, and that gently, both Sweat and Urine: Nay, it prevents the other warm <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> from acting in too inflamatory a Manner, and yet gives them Energy and Action. And further &s;till, it guards and Defends the Brain from the <HI>Deliriums, Stupors,</HI> or any <HI>Comato&s;e</HI> Af|fections, which the <HI>Opium</HI> might cau&s;e; &s;o that thus taken, there is &s;eldom any more than a gentle and refre&s;hing Sleep produc'd; &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary through all the Stages of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> I could here proceed to place it in Oppo&s;ition to all the <HI>Theriacalia</HI> and <HI>Bezoardica</HI> whatever; but it would carry me too far; once for all I will &s;ay, that it is the be&s;t I ever made u&s;e of, neither
<PB N="vij" REF="9">have I in &s;ome Hundreds found it di&s;agree|able to the Stomach or Head of any one.</P>
<P>The Proportion of the <HI>Laudanum</HI> may be ob&s;erv'd to be about one Grain to <HI>&scruple;jj,</HI> and thus it may be adapted to the &s;malle&s;t Infant, for if <HI>&scruple;jj</HI> be mix'd with a Julep of Six Ounces, or that may con&s;i&s;t of about Twelve Spoonfuls, one Spoonful at a Time will con|tain &s;o little <HI>Laudanum,</HI> that not the lea&s;t of any Danger can be apprehended from it; and with Truth, Confidence, and Experience I can atte&s;t, that as an <HI>Anodyne</HI> it far ex|ceeds <HI>Diacodium,</HI> or any the milde&s;t Opiats: Be&s;ides, it may be prepar'd without the <HI>Laudanum;</HI> but all this mu&s;t be left to the Di&s;cretion of the attending Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Whether it may be of U&s;e in the Time of the Plague, &s;hould the Almighty for our Sins vi&s;it us with that dreadful Scourge, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the Learned of the Faculty. How|ever, this in the mean time may be &s;aid, that it is conformable to what we find in Books written on that Subject by Phy&s;icians, who liv'd and practi&s;ed in &s;uch Times, when this and other Nations were afflicted with the <HI>Plague.</HI> And is agreeable to the Mea|&s;ures now taken in <HI>France</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Phy&s;icians, as they have communicated their way of proceeding to the World in <HI>[The Succinct Account of the</HI> Plague <HI>at</HI> Mar|&s;eilles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>] Be&s;ides, the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is truly accounted among&s;t Pe&s;tilential Fevers; and
<PB N="viij" REF="10"><HI>Portus</HI> with &s;ome others &s;tick not to call it <HI>Pe&s;tis Minoris Gradus,</HI> a Pe&s;tilence of a lower Degree; and very properly they think, &s;ince from its manner of being communicated by Contagion; its too frequently fatal Event: the vi&s;ible Malignity with which it &s;ome|times in &s;ome Per&s;ons appears, together with many particular Analogical Symptoms, it re|&s;embles the <HI>Plague</HI> not a little. But this only by the by.</P>
<P>To proceed a little farther; the inventing of good efficacious Medicines, is the Duty and Bu&s;ine&s;s of every Phy&s;ician, and the Inte|re&s;t of the Publick that he &s;hould make it &s;o, and is well recommended by a late In|genious Author in the following Words: <HI>By Study and Practice (&s;ays he) the</HI> Ma|teria Medica <HI>is improv'd and enlarg'd by the Addition of Efficacious Medicines, as well Simple as Compound, not known be|fore, or not apply'd to &s;uch U&s;es for which they have been found to &s;erve better than others in U&s;e. For by every u&s;eful new Medicine &s;o added, the Faculty is &s;o much enlarg'd, and &s;omething contributed to|wards the common Benefit of Mankind.</HI> Which is a general, and I think a &s;ufficient Defence for the pre&s;ent Attempt in offering after this Manner, what (with &s;ome Confi|dence I hope) may be &s;erviceable to the Pub|lick in a dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;uch an one from which this great Place, is &s;eldom,
<PB N="ix" REF="11">if ever totally free, and which proves too generally fatal.</P>
<P>To conclude; the&s;e are the Mea&s;ures I have taken, this is the Method I have con|&s;tantly of late Years ob&s;erv'd and follow'd; upon which I have had very great, I may &s;ay, unu&s;ual Succe&s;s. And I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on why the &s;ame fairly and hone&s;tly applied, may not be as &s;ucce&s;sful in the Hands of another as my own, for which Rea&s;on I make them Publick.</P>
<P>Let me throw one Word more into the Mouths of the Criticks, before they devour me, and I have done. It may be &s;aid, that what is contain'd in the Regimen, is mean, common, or trifling: To which I An|&s;wer, that if what is there is truly u&s;e|ful, as I am &s;ure it is, the more common they are, the more practicable and intelligible they will certainly be; which I reckon as an Excellency, whatever others may do; and if a Man's Endeavours are but &s;uc|ce&s;sful, he need not much care who acts in the more pompous Manner. But let us in this hear what our great Ma&s;ter the Di|vine <HI>Hippocrates</HI> &s;ays on that Head.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Honour'd</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Take the Liberty at la&s;t of pub|li&s;hing the&s;e few Pages, and giving them the Ornament of prefixing your Name to them. If there be any Thing that is Valuable in them in my own E&s;timation, it is contain'd in the&s;e two Particulars, the
<PB N="2" REF="13">kind Opinion you are pleas'd to have of them, and the Good I hope they may be in&s;trumental of in the Di&s;ea&s;e of which they treat.</P>
<Q>Te Cernimus, Albi, No&s;trorum Candide judex, Curantem quidquid dignum &s;apiente, Bo|no&abque; e&s;t.</Q>
<P>With all Submi&s;&s;ion I proceed to &s;peak of the following Di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> that is, of the Method I have taken in the curing of it. In which I &s;hall be very &s;hort, as to the Definitions, Signs, Diog|no&s;ticks, or other <GAP DESC="foreign">; &s;uch Parts having been very copiou&s;ly treated of by many great Authors, and in almo&s;t every Bodies Hands. The chief Stre&s;s of what I humbly propo&s;e, depending upon Hi&s;to|rical In&s;tances, and Matters of Fact: Not but it will be allow'd, and it frequently happens, that the Succe&s;s of Medicines and their various and multiform manner of U&s;e and Application, has given light into the Nature and Indoles of Di&s;ea&s;es; as the Ef|fect of &s;everal Parts of an Animal in Food or Medicine, hath been made u&s;e of to ex|plain their Nature, and even exemplify the Parts of which they may con&s;i&s;t; which may be &s;een in our two Famous Profe&s;&s;ors Dr. <HI>Gli&s;&s;on</HI> and Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> the fir&s;t in his
<PB N="3" REF="14"><HI>Anatomia,</HI> Cap. vi. the other in many places of his <HI>Anima Brutorum;</HI> as al&s;o in Sir <HI>George Ent,</HI> Dr. <HI>Morton,</HI> and &s;everal others; &s;o that Phy&s;iology and Practice thus attended to, may be ob&s;erv'd to illu&s;trate each other. And here, Sir, I mu&s;t again beg your Par|don, that I &s;hall be forced to place before you <HI>Cramben Recoctam,</HI> having already troubled you very much, with many of the Particulars I mu&s;t here recount. But before I can come to them, I mu&s;t &s;peak to a General or two: The fir&s;t of which is as to the general <HI>Regimen</HI> to be u&s;ed, the Cold or the Hot, as they are generally and vulgarly di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>For the Fir&s;t, Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> and his Fol|lowers &s;trenou&s;ly appear again&s;t the uni|ver&s;al Practice of tho&s;e that preceded him, as well as his Contemporaries; and I may &s;ay, again&s;t Nature her &s;elf: For tho' we may find inter&s;pers'd in their reciting the <HI>Pharmaceutica,</HI> &s;ometimes what will &s;eem to countenance the Cold Regimen, (in which the Countries and Climates where they practis'd might probably be a great Inducement) yet it is very plain, that they chiefly depended on <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> and the warm Method. <HI>Amatus Lu&s;itanus,</HI> who was as bold, I think, as any one in the U&s;e of the <HI>Refrigeria,</HI> yet has in a <HI>Scho|lium</HI> the&s;e Words, <HI>Quod variolarum &amp; Mor|billorum ad Cutem eruptio, quaedam a Na|tura
<PB N="4" REF="15">non &s;olum con&s;tituta, &s;ed de&s;tinata Cri|&s;is &s;it: Con&s;equens erit cum Hippocrate &amp; Galeno a&s;&s;everare; quod quando Natura eam conficere tentat, tunc Medicus Materiam fluere di&s;po&s;itam conden&s;are, aut a vi&acirc; &s;ua cohilere non debet; &s;ed Magis ip&s;am di&s;po|nere, ut per eam viam incedat per quam Na|tura expellere Conatur; juxta illud Hippoc. Quo Natura maxime vergit per loca confe|rentia, eo ducere.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this <HI>Scho|lium</HI> is hardly to be reconcil'd with his Practice, either in the Precedent, or fol|lowing <HI>Curatio;</HI> in this la&s;t, he tells us, that being &s;ent for to a Boy blind for Three Days of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which he mentions as an extraordinary Occurrence, he imme|diately fell to wa&s;hing and other Applica|tions to his Eyes, and with great Plea&s;ure acquaints his Reader, <HI>ex tenebris Puer ip&s;e revocatus.</HI> This would be mad Practice in <HI>England,</HI> whatever it was in <HI>Tu&s;cany;</HI> but this I mention to &s;hew, how little (as I &s;aid before) is to be depended on Ca&s;es Hi&s;torically only related: And that in dif|ferent Climates, it is not the di&s;cordant Opinions Phy&s;icians maintain again&s;t each other; but there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for that very Rea&s;on to take Mea&s;ures &s;omewhat dif|ferent. <HI>Reverius</HI> declares for the <HI>Alexi|pharmicks,</HI> and the warm Regimen, <HI>Primo ut Aeger in loco Calidiu&s;culo detineatur, quo Pori Cutis aperiantur, &amp; variolarum Erup|tio
<PB N="5" REF="16">adjuvetur,</HI> &amp;c. I forbear quoting that celebrated Practi&s;er at length, that I may be as little trouble&s;ome as po&s;&s;ible, and be|ing of no great Con&s;equence to the Rea|ders I chiefly intend this for. The &s;ame Thing might be repeated out of all the Au|thors of any Con&s;ideration, or Antiquity, which would be as Nau&s;eous, as it would be Endle&s;s. The Mi&s;chief which has ari&s;en is this; that in Practice, while there have been Endeavours u&s;ed towards an Inprove|ment, &s;ome have advanc'd from a Genial nece&s;&s;ary Warmth to almo&s;t actual Fire; and in&s;tead of keeping the cold de&s;tructive Air out, have perfectly &s;uffocated the poor Patients, by letting them have none at all; making at the &s;ame Time &s;uch va&s;t Fires (whatever be the Temper of the Air, or of the Sick Per&s;on) which cau&s;e Faintings with other Irregularities coincident with it. And on the other Hand, I &s;hall take the Liberty to &s;ay, that the Reformers have &s;tarted &s;o far out of that Method, in order to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by their new Di&s;coveries in di&s;avowing the Warm Regimen; that one would think there's no being Cool or Refre&s;hing for the Patient without Freez|ing. Let me therefore beg leave to follow the Celebrated Dr. <HI>Morton,</HI> who&s;e Practice is Regular and Rational, and who&s;e Suc|ce&s;s was An&s;werable. He po&s;itively de|clares for the Warm; and both throughout
<PB N="6" REF="17">his Precedent Rationale, as well as in the &s;ub&s;equent Hi&s;tories, reprehends the con|trary Proceeding; which he deliberately confutes, and de&s;cends even to mention the <HI>Materia</HI> made u&s;e of in the Cold Re|gimen; &s;uch as <HI>Spiritus vitrioli, Decoctum Album, Diacodium,</HI> and the like; nay, he &s;ays, that he was inform'd Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> him&s;elf had towards the latter Part of his Life gone off from that Opinion. Be that as it will, he was in the wrong, as Dr. <HI>Mor|ton</HI> thought, and will appear more to be &s;o, if we take but very little Pains to con|&s;ider the Aetiology of the Di&s;ea&s;e it &s;elf, or the Operations of Nature under it. For what is it that Nature is doing, or how can &s;he perform that vi&s;ible <HI>Diaplore&s;is,</HI> (if I may &s;o call the Eruption) but by a Warmth &s;omewhat higher than her con|&s;tant Tenor; &s;o that &s;he acts her &s;elf in the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> way; and that mu&s;t be|yond Contradiction be the right. Could we either &s;ub&s;titute any other Di&s;charge to carry off by it with &s;afety the repell'd Morbid Humours, or if ever a Sudorifick, or Expul&s;ive Operation (of that kind) could be perform'd, without the Con&s;titution be|ing &s;omewhat more than commonly warm; there would be room to &s;ay &s;omething; but when this can never be, which mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd by all, there will need but very little Argument or Per&s;ua&s;ion, to direct us
<PB N="7" REF="18">which of the two Regimens ought to be cho&s;en. And yet, notwith&s;tanding the apparency of the Ca&s;e, there are &s;till &s;ome &s;o blindly devoted to the following that otherwi&s;e great Man; and even notwith|&s;tanding their own ill Succe&s;s, they go on in a &s;upine, fatal Bigotry, and Dependance on his Word; and think that <HI>Sydenham</HI>'s Name is &s;ufficient to &s;helter, and ju&s;tify their own Inattention to Nature her&s;elf. In&s;omuch that I have heard it (with &s;ome Pain) affirm'd, that <HI>Diacodium</HI> was the <HI>Pa|nacea,</HI> which would do every Thing, and that nothing could be done well without it: That it was in the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> like the <HI>Cortex</HI> in intermitting Fevers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and however diver&s;ified the Di&s;ea&s;e might be, it has been, upon the ill Succe&s;s of the fir&s;t, doubled and trebled, and given the Patient without the lea&s;t Guard. <HI>Diacodium</HI> is que&s;tionle&s;s &s;ometimes a proper, as it is a Pacifick Medicine. But &s;uppo&s;e we meet with a Comato&s;e &s;leepy Di&s;po&s;ition in the Beginning, and it &s;hould attend the Di&s;temper in the other Stages, which in Flegmatick Pituito&s;e Habits is very fre|quent; mu&s;t we &s;till proceed to give this Roapy <HI>Opiat?</HI> Why, yes, if we believe the Sophi&s;try above, and which I have known pur&s;ued as long as Nature has la&s;ted. But enough of this unwelcome Subject.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="19">
<P>The next General I &s;hall trouble you with is Blood-letting. Tho' indeed, I think it ought not to be term'd a General, it being impo&s;&s;ible, but that it mu&s;t be de|&s;tructive in many Ca&s;es, and I believe very dubious in its Succe&s;s in any. There is a Que&s;tion, Sir, I have wanted long to be re&s;olv'd, and is as difficult to &s;tate, I believe as to re&s;olve. I have in debating occa&s;i|onally, whether Bleeding were generally good in the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> heard it affirm'd, that it certainly was, if timely admini&s;ter'd: The &s;ame Affirmation I have under the Hands of &s;ome Men Eminent in Practice; we find it likewi&s;e in many celebrated Au|thors already extant among us. As to the Time, it is agreed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t before the Eruption is in any Mea&s;ure perform'd; the Rea&s;ons alledg'd are, that it gives &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion to the excruciating Pains, and even dimini&s;hes the Morbid Mat|ter; &s;o that the Enemy being weaken'd, Nature mu&s;t be the better enabled to with|&s;tand the remaining Force. Before I come to expo&s;tualte on the Particulars, give me leave to &s;ugge&s;t, Fir&s;t, that it may be fre|quently ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in &s;ome Families is very &s;ignally, and as it were Hereditarily Fatal. This we find both Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> and Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> have ob&s;erv'd, and granted. Suppo&s;e then, Secondly, That in one Family Three Children of the
<PB N="9" REF="20">&s;ame Father and Mother &s;hould be treated in the <HI>Sydenhamian</HI> Way: The fir&s;t is blooded, has the benign, di&s;tinct &s;ort of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> and does well. The next after the &s;ame manner is Blooded, has the Confluent, malign &s;ort, and dies. The Third under the &s;ame Admini&s;tration of Bleeding, upon which appear the <HI>Maculae Nigrae, Lividae, Purpureae,</HI> &amp;c. and Na|ture under &s;o mi&s;erable a Pro&s;tration of Spi|rits, that &s;he quite gives up the Conten|tion; and yet for any Thing that could be &s;een or apprehended, this la&s;t might have been the di&s;tinct kind, which as Hi&s;tories are two to one. Such Events as the&s;e ought certainly to put us to a &s;tand; and for the Truth of the Facts, I can produce undeniable Evidence; but wave it here, be|cau&s;e I would not revive the Grief of tho&s;e, who make but too &s;evere Remarks upon the Proceeding. What Mea&s;ures therefore, Good Sir, mu&s;t we take? Will the taking of Blood away, alter the Indoles of the Di|&s;ea&s;e from the Malignant or Confluent kind, to the Benign and Di&s;creet &s;ort; if &s;o, it ought in all Subjects, and on all Occa&s;ions to be u&s;ed; and this is what they mean, by &s;aying it will le&s;&s;en the Quantity, or for my Part I know not what to make on't: But if this be difficult and uncertain, nay, I will &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible to make apparent; then they put Per&s;ons on a very great Ha|zard,
<PB N="10" REF="21">who make u&s;e of &s;uch dangerous Methods by weakening Nature, and in no re&s;pect le&s;&s;ening the Di&s;ea&s;e: Which Charge, how|ever &s;evere and heavy, mu&s;t in the general be confe&s;s'd to be true. For here, by the way, I mu&s;t take &s;o much Liberty, &s;trongly to pre&s;ume, that the kind of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in re&s;pect to its degree, is determin'd upon the fir&s;t imparting of the Contagion: Tho' out of doubt, the Di&s;po&s;ition the Blood and other Juices of the Body are in at that Time, does &s;trongly di&s;po&s;e to one or the other; &s;uch as was before &s;aid, the inhe|rent Cra&s;is of the Blood and Spirits, in re|&s;pect to the Parents we are De&s;cendants of, violent Exerci&s;e, hard Drinking, or other crapulous Di&s;orders, and the like; which not only expo&s;e us the &s;ooner to the re|ceiving the Infection (as is vulgarly and truly expre&s;s'd) but the Poi&s;onous <HI>Mia&s;|mata</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, are immediate|ly imparted to every Particle of the Fluids, being thus made &s;u&s;ceptible of them; and thus the Confluent kind of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is form'd, and as I &s;aid, determin'd, before it is po&s;&s;ible to admin&s;ter any Re|medy. So that except by Bleeding we can undertake to change the very Indoles of the Di&s;ea&s;e, even after it is form'd, tho' not render'd Vi&s;ible, which I believe is im|po&s;&s;ible; we &s;hall be in Danger of adding to the Di&s;ea&s;e, and ab&s;tracting from the
<PB N="11" REF="22">Strength of the Patient. For 'twill hardly ever be found, that the taking of Blood away, can re&s;tore it, from a Fu&s;ion to its natural Cra&s;is, that is, the <HI>Sphaerical</HI> red Parts, to their ju&s;t Magnitude, and the re&s;t, of what Denomination &s;oever, to their Natural Size, Figure, and Cohe&s;ion
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Dr.</HI> Morton<HI>'s Eleventh Hi&s;t.</HI></NOTE>. By the Lo&s;s of Blood, 'tis well known, that the Ma&s;s is attenuated; and for that very Rea&s;on is Phlebotomy admini&s;tred in many In&s;tances, as in Pleuri&s;ies, the <HI>Malacia, &amp;c.</HI> that &s;o there may be more room for the Heart in its Pul&s;es, to da&s;h and to&s;s, as it were, the Blood, by which Action the Lentor or too cohae&s;ive Parts may be divi|ded into &s;maller Portions. To this I mu&s;t add, that <HI>Haemorrhages,</HI> from whatever Part they flow, are not occa&s;ion'd, at lea&s;t very rarely, from a <HI>Plethora</HI> &s;imply &s;o call'd, or from the Strength and Force of the Pul&s;e; for then the mo&s;t robu&s;t Ani|mals, and tho&s;e that u&s;e the mo&s;t violent Exerci&s;e, would be mo&s;t liable to them, either Man or Bea&s;t; which is hardly ever ob&s;ervable: But mo&s;t frequently from the <HI>Prava Diathe&s;is</HI> of the Blood it &s;elf in the Loo&s;ening of its Texture; &s;o that in pa&s;|&s;ing the Capillaries, it is as it were perco|lated through 'em, or render'd &s;o keen, that

<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Whether the <HI>Indoles,</HI> that is, the Sort or Kind of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> be de|termin'd in each individual Per&s;on up|on the very fir&s;t Attack of the In|fection.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether it be po&s;&s;ible by any Admini&s;tration, e&s;pecially Bleeding, to make any Alteration or Mutation from Bad to Good, from the Conflu|ent to the Di&s;crete Kind.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, my Opinion by what has been already &s;aid, which I very humbly &s;ubmit to better Judgments.</P>
<P>At the End of the precedent Paragraph I have &s;aid, that Bli&s;ters are good in re|moving, or putting a Stop to that mi&s;chie|vous Symptom, namely, the <HI>Haemorrhages</HI> that frequently attend the Beginnings of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> The&s;e &s;ometimes appear, even before any other Signs, and prevent
<PB N="13" REF="24">the Struggle Nature generally makes to throw off the Di&s;ea&s;e from the Center to the <HI>Peripheria</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Morton<HI>'s Seventh Hi&s;t.</HI></NOTE>. Sometimes Bleeding at the No&s;e, Spitting of Blood, or an immo|derate Flux of the <HI>Men&s;es,</HI> appear ju&s;t at the Eruption; by which Nature in that ne|ce&s;&s;ary Effort is &s;o debilitated, that &s;he can't perform, nor go through that Task; and then the Enemy again retires to the Vitals, and acts all imaginable Mi&s;chief. I am well aware what <HI>Botallus</HI> and many others &s;ay, that the Lo&s;s of Blood will not produce the Effect here charg'd; but I mu&s;t de&s;ire to be excus'd, from re&s;igning my Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on; both which I mu&s;t do, &s;hould I make any Doubt of the retiring of the poi&s;onous Particles of this Di&s;ea&s;e; when upon the Lo&s;s of Blood, I &s;ee the Humours &s;ecreted from the Blood di&s;appear, and a vi&s;ible Palene&s;s &s;pread in its &s;tead, both on the Face, and all over the Body, which no one can deny, who has made any Number of regular Ob&s;ervations. But to return to Bli&s;ters. The&s;e Bleedings, as I &s;aid before, being occa&s;ion'd by the di&s;&s;ol|vent Pe&s;tilential Particles in the Serum of the Blood, breaking and dividing the Red Globules into a preternatural Smalne&s;s, and by that putting the Blood into a Fu&s;ion,
<PB N="14" REF="25">forces it through the Capillary Branches of the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els: But the Bli&s;ters drawing off Part of this Saline, Deleterious Serum, by abating its Quantity, the Globules afore|&s;aid are at Liberty to attract each other, and by that means to form them&s;elves in|to their genial and natural Size; and &s;o the Symptom cea&s;es: For I have had frequent Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in Per&s;ons that have been &s;eiz'd with the mo&s;t violent Effu&s;ion of Blood, that as &s;oon as the Serum has be|gun to fill the Bli&s;ter-Bladder, the Bleeding has con&s;tantly cea&s;ed. And thus even the Quantity of the peccant Matter may be &s;aid to be dimini&s;h'd. But where Per&s;ons are aver&s;e to Bli&s;ters, as too frequently they are, we need not be entirely at a Lo&s;s, nor have recour&s;e to that de&s;perate Expedient of Phlebotomy; for I do a&s;&s;ure you the Powder does it as certainly, and after a manner (as I &s;uppo&s;e) much like the Bli&s;ters; for by very &s;oon procuring a <HI>Dia|phore&s;is,</HI> the morbid Matter is brought to the Exteriors, and by Sweat the Deleterious Serum le&s;&s;en'd.</P>
<P>And here, by the way, give me Leave to &s;ay, with great Submi&s;&s;ion, that I take the Blood to be the fir&s;t <HI>Nidus</HI> of the con|tagious Particles, and not the Spirits, as Dr. <HI>Morton</HI> a&s;&s;erts; for as the Matter which fills the Bli&s;ters, and al&s;o what fills the Pu&s;tles of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> are Secretions
<PB N="15" REF="26">directly from the Blood; it is but rea&s;onable, I think, to conclude, that the <HI>Fomes</HI> or <HI>Pena</HI> is there for both. Be&s;ides, as the Spirits are form'd from the finer Parts of the Blood, and con&s;tantly receive their Sup|ply and Re&s;toration from that Magazine; &s;o it is but natural to conclude, (till the contrary can be demon&s;trated) that what Detriment, Labefaction, or Pollution &s;oever they receive, mu&s;t be communicated the &s;ame way. As to the Quickne&s;s of its Com|munication, that can be no Objection to any one, that con&s;iders the Pul&s;e of the Heart and Arteries, and the Motion of the Blood in them; &s;o that it requires but a very few Minutes, after the receiving of the Infectious <HI>Lentor</HI> into the Blood, before it may by &s;topping in the fine Capillaries of the <HI>Meninges,</HI> Brain, and Spinal Mar|row, give Occa&s;ion to all tho&s;e violent Or|ga&s;ms exercis'd, and communicated through the whole <HI>Sy&s;ta&s;is Nervo&s;a;</HI> and which, while loo&s;ely carry'd in the <HI>Rivus</HI> of the Blood, has little Opportunity of exerting tho&s;e excruciating and dolorous Sen&s;ations. And farther &s;till, it may be made almo&s;t a daily Ob&s;ervation, that Per&s;ons having been conver&s;ant in Places infected, have remov'd to others free of the Di&s;ea&s;e; yet after many Days the In&s;ults of the Di&s;ea&s;e have begun upon the Nerves, which is a pretty plain In&s;tance. But this by the by. How|ever,
<PB N="16" REF="27">when we come to con&s;ider the Di|&s;temper once form'd as Phy&s;icians, the Spirits have their Share, and &s;uffer violent|ly; and except we con&s;ider the Blood and Spirits in this complex View, we &s;hall ne|ver di&s;cover the true curative Indications; which is what I come now to &s;peak of, and &s;hall do it in a very few Words.</P>
<P>Without repeating what has been already &s;aid, the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Spirits, the <HI>Diathe&s;is</HI> the Blood is then in, and the Na|ture of the Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hew, I think, the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Proceeding in the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> Way, by promoting a general <HI>Diaphere&s;is</HI> in a gentle manner, by &s;uch Medicines as will invigorate the Nerves and Spirits, by fitting them for, as well as putting them upon Action; and at the &s;ame time pro|mote a Sudoriferous Per&s;piration over the whole Body: So that Neurotick, Volatil, Cephalick Medicines, mix'd with Anodines, and &s;uch as will cau&s;e Sweat without an Inflamation, (all which is to be obtain'd by a Right proceeding, and the <HI>Alexipharma|con</HI> here propo&s;ed) is, and mu&s;t &s;urely be acknowledg'd to be the regular Way and Means of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Nature in this Exigency. I have often wonder'd to find &s;o few of that Cla&s;s of Medicines, call'd Cephalicks, in the <HI>Materia</HI> of Dr. <HI>Morton,</HI> who proceeds on &s;uch Principles in affirming the fir&s;t At|tacks to be made upon the Nerves, and
<PB N="17" REF="28">their Propagines; for want of which, many of the noble&s;t <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> are render'd not only ineffectual, but hurtful, by doing nothing el&s;e than inflaming the Blood, and &s;corching the Vitals, &s;uch as Saffron, <HI>Rad. Serpent.</HI> &amp;c. The like Mi&s;chief may be charg'd upon Opiates &s;imply given, with|out the Guard of Volatil Medicines to at|tend them; which &s;top and impede Nature in the Di&s;charge; and in&s;tead of procuring that gentle Requies and Refre&s;hment of Sleep, &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> cau&s;e horrible Deliriums, Convul&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But that I may give you no farther Trouble, I proceed now to lay before you the Series of the Cure, a Method I have (by God's Ble&s;&s;ing) found more than com|monly &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as there is any Su&s;picion of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> let the Per&s;on attack'd go imme|diately to Bed, and endeavour, if po&s;&s;ible, to get &s;ome Sleep: Towards the attaining of which, let there be kept the profounde&s;t Silence; (which is a Rule to be ob&s;erv'd through the whole Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e:) For it is hardly to be imagin'd, what inexpre&s;|&s;ible Di&s;advantages &s;ick Per&s;ons labour un|der, and what Symptomatick Mi&s;chiefs they heap upon them&s;elves, by &s;triving (as they call it) again&s;t the Di&s;ea&s;e: By going into the Air, they &s;ometimes repel the mor|bid Humours to the Vitals; which may be
<PB N="18" REF="29">done even before there be any vi&s;ible Ap|pearance of them upon the Surface of the Body. Others by Exerci&s;e, Diver&s;ion, hard Drinking, and the like, thinking to divert, greatly increa&s;e the Di&s;ea&s;e. Which can be of no Advantage in the Beginning of any Fever, but in this does often prove perni|cious. Let the Patient be cover'd with as many Cloaths as may rea&s;onably be &s;up|pos'd will produce &s;uch a Warmth, as is natural, acceptable, and plea&s;ant in the Winter, and no farther. If the Pains and unquiet To&s;&s;ings be &s;uch, that no Re&s;t can be obtain'd without Help; at the End of Twelve Hours from the fir&s;t Attack, and not &s;ooner without apparent Nece&s;&s;ity, let the following Draught be taken.</P>
<Q><HI>&rx;</HI> Aq. Lactis Alexit. Germ. Querc. <HI>a~ &ounce;j.</HI> Theriacal. <HI>&dram;vj.</HI> Pulv. Alex. no&s;tri <HI>&dram;&s;s</HI> vel <HI>&scruple;ij.</HI> Syr. de Aurantiis <HI>&ounce;&s;s</HI> Ms. f. Hau&s;t.</Q>
<P>And let it be repeated every Eight Hours. But if there be violent Symptoms, &s;uch as Bleeding at the No&s;e or Mouth, <HI>Fluxus Men&s;ium immodicus vel praematurus,</HI> excru|ciating Pains, Watching, or the like, it may be repeated every Six or every Four Hours. The precedent Do&s;e is fitted for Adult Per&s;ons: But for Children of one, two, or three Years old, five Grains is &s;uf|ficient; and to be repeated according to the
<PB N="19" REF="30">Age and Strength of the Patient, or the Quantity each time given. The Vehicle above-mention'd is what I generally make u&s;e of; but the Powder may be given in a little Syrup, &s;mall Sack-Whey, or any thing el&s;e, except <HI>Diacodium.</HI> If the &s;ick Per|&s;ons are able, let them be help'd out of Bed once every Day; but in this, let their own De&s;ires, join'd with common Prudence, be the Rule; for no other can be &s;et.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;ider'd, is the Quantity of Liquids to be allow'd. I am not for &s;uch large Quantities of Malted Liquors, I mean Small Beer, as is generally in pre&s;ent Practice admitted; neither am I totally for denying them. But a Decoction of Figs with &s;ome <HI>Cochineel,</HI> and in&s;pirited with &s;ome &s;mall Portion of right good Ca|nary, I permit in good Plenty almo&s;t to the Patient's Choice. As,
<Q><HI>&rx;</HI> Ficuum Pinginum <HI>lb&s;s</HI> Cochinel. <HI>&dram;&s;s.</HI> coqr. in aq. Fontan. &s;. q. ad <HI>lbij</HI> &s;ub fi|nem addendo Vini Canarij <HI>&ounce;iiij</HI> pl&ugrave;s minu&s;v&egrave; Bulliant &s;emel tum adde Syr. de Rubo Ideo <HI>&ounce;&s;s</HI> fiat Apozema &amp; refrigeratum libat ad Libitum.</Q> This Liquor exceeds any that I have known made u&s;e of; for it keeps the Throat and Pa&s;&s;ages of the Lungs free and open, gent|ly promotes the Eruption; at the &s;ame time
<PB N="20" REF="31">that it exhilerates the Spirits, and abates the Thir&s;t: And I have not among &s;ome Hundreds met with any one Per&s;on, but was pleas'd with it. For in Small Beer, there is generally in Fevers a mo&s;t unwel|come Clammine&s;s &s;ucceeding the drinking of it.</P>
<P>When the Eurption is perfected, &s;o that the fir&s;t Symptoms are abated, the Draught above-mention'd need be repeated but every Night at the Hour of Re&s;t; nor even then if there be a Natural Propen&s;ity to &s;leep, and the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> be of the mild di&s;tinct Kind, (yet I always advi&s;e to have it in <HI>promptu);</HI> but in the Confluent Kind I think it ought to be taken every twenty|four Hours at lea&s;t, through the whole Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. When the time of Maturation, or according to the Vulgar Idiom, the filling and ripening of the Pu&s;tles commences; which according to Dr. <HI>Mor|ton,</HI> may be reckon'd to begin about three Days after the total Eruption; the fore&s;aid Draught is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to be taken twice every Twenty-four Hours: And then I do very much recommend the drinking of large Quantities of what we call Milk-Porridge, made after this Manner: The Oatmeal being finely fifted may be boil'd in a due Quantity of Water for Half an Hour, or very little more, then add a Third Part of New Milk, and ju&s;t give it
<PB N="21" REF="32">one Boil &s;o as to mix it well together, and 'tis enough. This I order &s;ometimes to be taken Hot as <HI>Tea</HI> or <HI>Coffee,</HI> thus taken it will keep the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Throat clear; and frequently as I have ob&s;erv'd, will make the Scabs of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which are en|gag'd in the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;cale off, and come away. At other Times to drink a good Draught of the &s;ame very near Cold, and &s;ometimes to be taken warm as Food. This &s;mooth mild <HI>Pabulum</HI> cloaths, and indeed does as it were dige&s;t the <HI>Ichorous Serum</HI> of the Blood, to which <HI>Diathe&s;is</HI> in the con|fluent Kind it is very much di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;upplies it with a &s;oft Chylo&s;e Matter, wherewith to fill the Pu&s;tles. It likewi&s;e &s;upplies the Salivation, where it happens with a proper Fluid, gently rai&s;es it when it abates, and keeps up the nece&s;&s;ary Tume|&s;actions of the Extremities. It may be al&s;o a rea&s;onable Means to prevent any Tabid or Con&s;umptive Di&s;po&s;itions, which are here frequently founded: And I have always ob|&s;erv'd the Patients very &s;oon recover their Strength, who have plentifully taken of this &s;imple innocent Food. In the mean time, the Decoction of the Figs is not to be omitted being &s;ometimes taken.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, am I come to the la&s;t Stage, the Cri&s;is and Declination of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which is attended with le&s;s or more Diffi|culty, according as the Precedent have
<PB N="22" REF="33">been treated; and in which I have found little trouble, where I have had the Op|portunity of directing its &s;etting out; and even &s;till are the <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> to be u&s;ed, tho' at greater Di&s;tances, &s;o that I recom|mend the &s;ame Draught every Night, then every other Night, and &s;o to be left off. I confe&s;s at this time, too frequently appears the direful Symptons in the confluent Kind, and require the utmo&s;t Penetration to find out Means to a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature, that &s;he may defend her &s;elf again&s;t this la&s;t A&s;&s;ault. As for Bleeding, I hope, &s;uch Adventrous Un|dertakings are quite out of Thought. And really, Sir, I have not been able to collect any great Advantage even from Bli&s;ters as commonly directed, that is on any other Part of the Body except the Head; for at this time the chief Intention is to &s;timulate Nature in her &s;everal Offices to act the re|maining Part with &s;ome Vigor. Neither have I found there has been any rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the good Con&s;equences, though the Bli&s;ters have had their common Effect; for there having been &s;o va&s;t an Expence of Juices already, there is apt to follow Deli|quiums, and a great Pro&s;tration of Spirits upon this &s;econd additional Di&s;charge; but Bli&s;ters on the Head, from who&s;e Office we expect little more than to excite and &s;tir up the remaining Force, are, and have been of excellent U&s;e. Nay, Sir, I have made u&s;e,
<PB N="23" REF="34">I do a&s;&s;ure you, of actual Fire upon the Head, and vi&s;ibly, under God, deliver'd two Per&s;ons who were in the very Article, when all was thrown up, and others had withdrawn them&s;elves, and nothing but Death expected every Moment. But where the U&s;e of this, by rea&s;on of its &s;eeming Severity, &s;hould be deny'd the Phy&s;ician, in&s;tead of it I advi&s;e, that after as much Hair of the Head can be taken off, as the pre&s;ent Urgency will admit of (tho' I always order that to be done at the beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e) then to fill a Broad, Thin, Linnen Bag, with brui&s;ed Cantharides, and having dipp'd it into boiling Vinegar, to lay it almo&s;t &s;calding Hot upon the Head. This, I confe&s;s, I never had occa&s;ion to make Tryal of but once, and then 'twas with evident Succe&s;s, the Per&s;on being now living, but e&s;pecial Care mu&s;t be taken to &s;ee the Bag keeps warm, for if it turn cold it may prove mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>Having thus far &s;poken of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> in regard to Per&s;ons that may be Patients under it, in an indifferent and general Man|ner; I now intreat your Permi&s;&s;ion, Good Sir, to &s;peak of Women with Child, who are afflicted with that Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ingularly, and in a Place by them&s;elves; their Condi|tion having been always look'd on as full of Hazard upon many Accounts; and for who&s;e Sake chiefly you have all this Trou|ble,
<PB N="24" REF="35">and the pre&s;ent Publication (if it may be &s;o) is made to the World. Not but that the Di&s;temper is the &s;ame in every re&s;pect that regards it &s;elf, and mu&s;t be generally &s;o treated. But the &s;ad Fatality which &s;o commonly attends the&s;e poor People at that time; the con&s;idering that Two Lives are included in one Individual, and therefore that one Fate mu&s;t attend them, and both be &s;av'd or lo&s;t together; with other Cir|cum&s;tances, which too often go along with it, that it mo&s;t frequently happens on a Woman's fir&s;t Pregnancy; &s;o that the Ex|pectations of a Family on one Side are cer|tainly extinct, and &s;ometimes it hath fallen out that both have been.</P>
<P>The&s;e and other moving Incidents put me upon the utmo&s;t Stre&s;s of con&s;idering their Ca&s;es, with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t heedful Attention I was Ma&s;ter of. And I do here, and ever mu&s;t with all the Grati|tude of my Soul, acknowledge and adore the Divine Goodne&s;s on the&s;e poor Endea|vours; and which I hope are agreeable to the Proceedure of Nature, and the <HI>Ars Medica,</HI> by what follows.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t again inculcate, as I mu&s;t on all Occa&s;ions, that the &s;trict Enquiry in|to the Animal Oeconomy is and has been the ju&s;t, regular, and only Means for di&s;|covering u&s;eful Remedies; at lea&s;t the proper Way of rendring any of the Parti|culars
<PB N="25" REF="36">of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> rationally, and therefore as con&s;tantly &s;ucce&s;sful as the Strength of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or the Weakne&s;s of Humanity will admit of. Thus Dr. <HI>Her|man Grabe</HI> puts it into a Kind of exempla|ry Method; and in di&s;tinct Chapters tells us, what Ways we are to take, if ever we intend or de&s;ire to make any commendable Di&s;coveries in Chirurgery or Pharmacy; and therefore propo&s;es to our Imitation, the Examples of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Phy&s;iolo|gi&s;ts of the Time he liv'd in, or a little be|fore it; beginning at our Great Country|man Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> and in&s;tances in many Particulars, what Light the Knowledge of the Circulation of the Blood has given to the Pathology of Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Secrets that may be di&s;clo&s;ed from the Ob&s;erva|tions thereon. He proceeds afterward to the Di&s;coveries made by <HI>Bartholine, Whar|ton, Steno, Sylvius,</HI> and <HI>Willis;</HI> and &s;eve|rally hinting, what u&s;eful Inventions have been, and &s;till may be made for the Good of Mankind by following their Pattern, which he pre&s;&s;es very earne&s;tly to all the Practi&s;ers in that noble Art. And here I beg you will indulge me &s;o far, to affirm to you, that if there be any thing valuable in what I now lay before you, it is owing to the con&s;idering the Parts of a Gravid Fe|male more intimately than ordinary, at the Time when the&s;e Parts of the Kingdom
<PB N="26" REF="37">were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> And find|ing &s;o little Encouragement; and on the contrary, &s;o much Forbiddance in the Suc|ce&s;s of the common Procedure, either in Books or Ob&s;ervation; there &s;eem'd to me to be a Kind of tacit Demand made by the tender Sex upon all the Practi&s;ers in the Science, to have their Ca&s;e peculiarly con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>To &s;peak fir&s;t in general, and to con&s;ider, that Nature is then intent upon the great Work of propagating and perpetuating her|&s;elf in the Species: And that this is a Task the mo&s;t arduous in its Performance of all natural Functions, is &s;ufficiently ob&s;ervable from the great Turn, and, as it were, Re|volution made in the Con&s;titution. Not to entertain you with the &s;hocking Expre&s;|&s;ions of the Act of Generation, though really ob&s;ervable enough, but the Con&s;e|quences of it. Upon the fir&s;t &s;etting out of the <HI>Primordia</HI> of Conception, the <HI>Men|&s;es</HI> are intercepted; &s;o that the Blood, Spi|rits, Lymph, and the whole <HI>Genus fluidum</HI> of the Sy&s;tem take a new Turn; and this not purely for the Nutrition of the but ju&s;t conceiv'd <HI>Faetus,</HI> which it does not, nor is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould receive the thou&s;andth Part, but for many other U&s;es and Rea&s;ons, and for this general one among&s;t the re&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he would not admit of any Avoca|tion, or Interruption in this &s;o great an
<PB N="27" REF="38">Undertaking. And we almo&s;t always &s;ee, that Mi&s;carriages (not to &s;peak of the Lo&s;s of the <HI>Embryo,</HI> which however ought to be con&s;ider'd, and &s;eems to be a Duty im|ply'd in our Oaths) are incomparably more full of Danger, and ruinous, even to the Health of the Mother, than natural and timely Births. And this, I &s;uppo&s;e, no one will put me upon proving, when Na|ture, and every Day's Experience, manife&s;ts it to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial Ob&s;ervation. But when to this is added, the violent In&s;ults of a little le&s;s than Pe&s;tilential Fever; when &s;he is forced from this her grand Intention, call'd off and diverted to contend with what is &s;o frequently too &s;trong of it &s;elf, and which God in his merciful Admini&s;tra|tion and Providence has &s;o order'd, that human Nature is rarely, if ever, more than once in each Individual &s;ubjected to it. When to the&s;e general Di&s;advantages, &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of the Mother, as the <HI>Foetus,</HI> when of any Magnitude, mu&s;t be accounted, is in Danger, if not timely pre|vented, of being torn from her; by which &s;o great an Effu&s;ion of Blood, and other Fluids, &s;uch an Exhau&s;tion of Spirits mu&s;t immediately follow: What Inten&s;ene&s;s of Thought and Sedulity mu&s;t the&s;e Con&s;ide|rations rai&s;e in every one, that de&s;ires, or intends to make him&s;elf &s;erviceable in his Employ, to which he has a&s;&s;ign'd him&s;elf,
<PB N="28" REF="39">and is, as it were, elected? Upon &s;uch like Ob&s;ervations as the&s;e, I thought my &s;elf excu&s;able, if I took a Method &s;omewhat pe|culiar, to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, that which might be otherwi&s;e de&s;tructive of the Mo|ther and Offspring; and without this be|ing done, every Day's &s;ad Experience &s;uf|ficiently &s;hews, that both mu&s;t generally be lo&s;t together. To detain you therefore no longer; As &s;oon as ever I have been call'd to a Woman with Child, and there has been Rea&s;on to believe &s;he would be &s;eiz'd with the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> as by the u&s;ual Symptoms in the Per&s;on her &s;elf, or the Place where &s;he lives being vi&s;ited, together with her own Fears and Apprehen&s;ions be|ing &s;trongly employ'd or affected; in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, without &s;taying for the appearing of any other Sign, to make the Diagno&s;tick certain, I always give &s;omething to prevent Mi&s;carriage; and in this, I dare pre&s;ume you, Sir, will agree with me, that I am regularly di&s;charging my Duty, becau&s;e &s;uch Admini&s;tration can have no Male-Tendency: Be&s;ides, the <HI>Lucta</HI> is &s;o great, the Convul&s;ion frequently &s;o violent, at the &s;ame time that the poi&s;onous <HI>Mia&s;mata</HI> are making their In&s;ults upon the Internals be|fore the Eruption, that the <HI>Placenta</HI> is in great Danger of being very much loo&s;en'd, if not immediately torn and divided from the Mother; upon which, all the Symptoms
<PB N="29" REF="40">before recited, and many more, mu&s;t be exa&s;perated. And under this Oppre&s;&s;ion, while Nature is held in this unhappy Di|lemma of attending one or the other, either to expel the Di&s;ea&s;e, or pre&s;erve the <HI>Em|bryo,</HI> and is not able to perform both; du|ring the He&s;itation, both Mother and Child are in the mo&s;t eminent Danger of being lo&s;t: Immediately therefore I order the following <HI>Bolus</HI> and Draught.</P>
<Q><P><HI>&rx;</HI> Pulv. Rad. Tormentil. <HI>&dram;&s;s</HI> Bi&s;tort. gr. <HI>x.</HI> cort. Cinnamon. gr. <HI>vij.</HI> Con&s;. Cynosbat. <HI>&scruple;ij.</HI> Syr. de Ro&s;is &s;iccis q. &s;. f. Bolus. Quem capiat Aegra quamprimum &amp; &s;uperbibat Hau&s;tum &s;equentem.</P>

<P>After this has been taken about Two Hours, I then order the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> Draught before-mention'd. In which you &s;ee, I regard both the Pregnancy of the Mother, as well as endeavour to get the Enemy at the &s;ame time remov'd to that convenient Di&s;tance from the Vitals, that we may with &s;ome tolerable Safety parly with him. The <HI>Bolus</HI> and Draught again&s;t Abortion, I certainly repeat at the End of four Hours after taking the fir&s;t; but then
<PB N="30" REF="41">omit it for twelve Hours, except &s;ome pe|culiar Rea&s;ons from the Patient oblige me to repeat it &s;ooner. The Signs of an ap|proaching Mi&s;carriage, and that of the na|tural Birth being &s;o very like, and Women being &s;o abundantly &s;en&s;ible of the Particu|larities in that Ca&s;e, I need not take up any room here in reciting them: Upon which Occa&s;ions and Informations, I repeat the <HI>Bolus</HI> and Draught every three, four, or five Hours, as Need &s;hall require; the Per|&s;en her&s;elf being kept in Bed in the mo&s;t quiet Di&s;po&s;ition and Po&s;ture that is po&s;&s;ible, till the&s;e threatning Signs abate. For at this time I am &s;o intent on tying, as it were, all things fa&s;t in the Communication be|tween the Mother and <HI>Foetus,</HI> that in truth I think nothing &s;afe, or like to be &s;o, till that great Point is &s;ecur'd; and that the foremention'd <HI>Bolus,</HI> or the <HI>Rad. Tormentil.</HI> (in what Form the Phy&s;ician &s;hall think fit, or the Prtient can be&s;t take it) will do; at lea&s;t I never yet knew it fail. But &s;till I would have the Decoction of Figs before &s;poken of, in proper Intervals freely u&s;ed (and likewi&s;e the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> Draught &s;ometimes) as being what will dilute the Fervency of the Blood, and help to break and divide the morbid and peccant Matter from it, and is a good <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> be&s;ides. After this, I generally repeat the two Me|dicines again&s;t Abortion once every Twen|ty
<PB N="31" REF="42">four Hours, as there is Opportunity, &s;o as not to interfere with the Medicines ne|ce&s;&s;ary to bring forward the general Di&s;ea&s;e. But however, when that is near the State, and grows towards a Cri&s;is, I never omit giving it twice at lea&s;t in Twenty four Hours. After that is over, I withdraw tho&s;e re&s;tringent Medicines to once in that Time: Then to once in Two natural Days; and then to once in three or four Days. But if the Di&s;ea&s;e be of the milde&s;t Kind, then neither this, nor any other Medicine, directed to what Intention &s;oever, need be &s;o frequently repeated. But if it be of the Confluent, or even of the Cohaerent Kind, if we keep not upon the Guard, we &s;hall be in Danger of being &s;urprized; for in &s;uch Kind of Fevers that are, or are near like Pe&s;tilential, there is &s;uch Relaxation, or, may I not call it, a Di&s;&s;olution in all the Juices, and al&s;o in the internal Membranes, that they too frequently fall, as it were, in &s;under; and thus &s;ometimes di&s;appoint us in our mo&s;t confident and &s;anguine Expecta|tion. When the Cri&s;is is pa&s;s'd, and all the Symptoms much abated, and Nature un|der a &s;en&s;ible Alleviation and Refre&s;hment, we may with Rea&s;on believe the Patient out of Danger, con&s;ider'd &s;ingly in the Mother; &s;o that the <HI>Embryo</HI> ought now to be our pe|culiar Regard. As &s;oon therefore as it is manife&s;t that it may be done without Ha|zard,
<PB N="32" REF="43">I would have the inferior Inte&s;tines empty'd of the <HI>Faeces</HI> by the common do|me&s;tick Cli&s;ter of Milk and Sugar. The &s;ame may be repeated the next Day; and then intermitting a Day, it may be again made u&s;e of, if the Strength of the Patient will admit of it. But I do po&s;itively de|clare again&s;t any purging Medicine being taken at the Mouth by Women with Child; becau&s;e it puts the Child into the utmo&s;t Danger of being expell'd before its time: Of which, with Permi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall give you Two pretty plain In&s;tances.</P>
<P>A Gentlewoman of this Town, who had the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in the milde&s;t manner ima|ginable, &s;o that there was little or no Oc|ca&s;ion for any A&s;&s;i&s;tance on any re&s;pect whatever, was (tho' with Child) treated at the latter End, as in common Ca&s;es, with purging Medicines, by which (in her own Opinion, and al&s;o in that of mo&s;t about her) &s;he mi&s;carry'd. Again:</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Snow,</HI> a Gentlewoman who was mo&s;t &s;everely handled, as by her Ca&s;e here|after recited appears, upon her Recovery from the utmo&s;t Danger, was &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Nece&s;&s;ity of being purg'd after &s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e, that notwith&s;tanding all I could &s;ay, would not be prevail'd with, but purg'd &s;he would be. I order'd her nothing el&s;e but</P>
<P>&rx; <HI>Mannae, Sal Cathartic. Glauberaa.</HI> &ounce;&s;s.
<PB N="33" REF="44">to be taken in Gruel; by which &s;he had Five moderate Stools: Yet even this cau&s;ed in the Child &s;uch tremulous, fluttering and di&s;order'd Motions, and in her &s;elf &s;uch parturient Pains, that without waiting to know whether the Purge had fini&s;h'd its full Operation, I was nece&s;&s;itated to give the Draught and <HI>Bolus</HI> again&s;t Abortion: Upon which &s;he was abundantly convinced, and de&s;ir'd &s;he might have no more Purges. Neither indeed had &s;he any more, nor any one el&s;e with whom I was concern'd, who were with Child, any thing of that Kind, but the Cli&s;ter before-mentioned, till after the Time of their Delivery. They and their Children are all alive, and in perfect Health, (Mrs. <HI>Dove</HI> being long &s;ince &s;afely deliver'd.) And more I think I need not urge. I only therefore beg your Patience for one Word more of Comfort to Women with Child. And pardon, I intreat you, good Sir, any &s;eeming Vanity in it. As I have laid their Ca&s;e, as well as I can, be|fore you, I may with &s;ome A&s;&s;urance, as well as Plea&s;ure, &s;ay, that thus con&s;ider'd, their Condition is even not &s;o dangerous as other Women: For it is ob&s;erv'd by Au|thors, and may be &s;o very often in our own Practice, that the Proceeding and Advance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and its Cure, is interrupted by the Men&s;truation of Female Patients, even in their timely and regular manner;
<PB N="34" REF="45">and is enumerated
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Marton,</HI> Cap. 3. P. 207.</NOTE> as one &s;ingular Di&s;ad|vantage in their Ca&s;e, and is much wor&s;e when (as it frequently happens) it appears before its Time. For a Confirmation of what I now &s;ay, I refer my &s;elf to Dr. <HI>Mor|ton</HI>'s Hi&s;torical Ob&s;ervations in the 9th, 18th, 36th, 37th, 41&s;t, 52d Hi&s;tories of <HI>Puretology.</HI> And for the unhappy Events &s;ub&s;equent on Abortions, the 43d and 44th Hi&s;tories of the &s;ame Author are &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies. I &s;hall add but this one gene|ral Ob&s;ervation more, on which it cannot but be imagin'd I mu&s;t reflect with &s;ome Satisfaction, that during the Continuance of the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> in the&s;e Parts, there was not one Per&s;on with Child, for whom I was con&s;ulted, whom I treated not in the Me|thod above de&s;crib'd; and not one of them but is now alive, and &s;o are their Children: Except Mrs. <HI>Withnoe</HI>'s, which liv'd above a Fortnight, and then I believe died on the fir&s;t In&s;ults of the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> there being a Nece&s;&s;ity, by rea&s;on of the weak Condition of the Mother, and other Di&s;orders of the Family, to keep it con&s;tantly in a Room, where Three others lay mi&s;erably afflicted of the Confluent Sort of <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> And I can't learn from the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiry I have made, that any e&s;cap'd that were not
<PB N="35" REF="46">thus dealt withal; but both mi&s;carried and died, except the Gentlewoman before hin|ted at, who only mi&s;carry'd upon her being purg'd after the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, I &s;hall take Leave to lay before you &s;ome Hi&s;torical Ca&s;es: Which I hope, Sir, will not only &s;eem excu&s;able, but nece&s;&s;ary, and even incumbent on me; that &s;o any Per&s;on may be &s;atisfied, that &s;hall think fit to enquire into the Truth of the Relations from the Per&s;ons them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Fir&s;t</HI> CASE.</HEAD>
<P>A Servant-Maid of Mrs. <HI>Blythe,</HI> at the <HI>Red Lion</HI> in <HI>Stamford,</HI> was &s;eiz'd on the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> 1715. with Vomiting, a racking Pain in her Head, Back, and Loins; which after about four Hours remitted, and &s;he was able, though very weakly, to at|tend the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e. On the 15th her Pains return'd, when I was &s;ent for; and enquiring whether &s;he had had the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> before, and being an&s;wer'd in the Negative, I told them there was great Rea|&s;on to believe &s;he now would. Pre&s;ently after the <HI>Men&s;es</HI> broke &s;omewhat before the natural Time in a pretty large manner, at which the Patient was greatly terrified. At Night they remov'd her, with great Care,
<PB N="36" REF="47">to another Part of the Town; and &s;hewing a great Di&s;inclination to the taking of any Medicine, from a covetous Fear, as I per|ceiv'd, of the Charge, I left her without any. On the 16th, very early in the Morning, Mrs. <HI>Blythe</HI> came to me, told me that her Maid was dying, and that the <HI>Men&s;es</HI> flow'd from her like the Floodings of a Woman after Delivery. I found her indeed in a very weak Condition, her Pul&s;e quick and low, her &s;elf very &s;hort breath|ing, and in frequent <HI>Deliquiums.</HI> I order'd her to take the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> Draught im|mediately, and to be repeated every four Hours for three times; for &s;he had got no Sleep, and at the &s;ame time a large Bli&s;ter to be laid to her Neck. At Night I found her much refre&s;h'd, and the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> be|ginning to appear in large Spots on &s;everal Parts, as the Confluent Kind generally does: the <HI>Fluxus Catmeniorum</HI> was &s;omewhat re|&s;train'd. I order'd the &s;ame Draught to be repeated at the Hour of Re&s;t; and the Bli&s;ter, which had been neglected, to be apply'd. On the 17th, in the Morning, I found the Eruption general, the Patient had taken pretty good Re&s;t, and the <HI>Delirium,</HI> which had before at intermitting times tor|mented her, gone off. The <HI>Men&s;trua</HI> &s;till continued, and this Day more than that before. But the Bli&s;ter, through the &s;tupid Conceitedne&s;s of a poor ignorant Nur&s;e,
<PB N="37" REF="48">was not yet apply'd; and finding there was no Dependance on her, I laid it on with my own Hands, and repeated the &s;ame Draught as before. At Night I found all things much amended, the <HI>Men&s;es</HI> &s;topp'd, the Eruption come much forward, the Bli&s;ter having taken a full Effect, and the Patient, after a good Sleep, much refre&s;h'd. I con|tinued the U&s;e of the Draught every Night only, till near the Cri&s;is, and then repeated it Night and Morning for three or four Days. All this Time &s;he took plentifully of the Decoction of Figs; and towards the Time of ripening, very freely of Milk-Porridge: And thus, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing, under many Di&s;advantages, &s;he perfectly recover'd.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Second</HI> CASE.</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1715. The Wife of <HI>William Weight</HI> of <HI>Uffington</HI> near <HI>Stamford,</HI> was &s;eiz'd with the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> On the Fifth Day of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;econd of the Eruption, I was &s;ent for, by which time it &s;ufficiently appear'd to be the confluent Kind. She had for Twelve Hours been tormented with a violent Loo&s;ene&s;s, and Griping before I came to her; and was now at every Stool Fainting and Swooning: Upon her Brea&s;t, Arms, and many other
<PB N="38" REF="49">Parts, appear'd Black, and Livid Spots; which I &s;hewed her Si&s;ter, who expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t tender Care and Concern for her; at the &s;ame time telling her how little Hopes there was of the Patient. This was the 21&s;t of the Month, and about Noon I order'd her the Draught, with &scruple;ij. of the <HI>Alexipharmick</HI> Powder to be pre&s;ently taken, and &s;tay'd by her to &s;ee the Event. In about an Hour an Half the <HI>Lax</HI> &s;eem'd to be &s;topp'd, and &s;he fell into a Sleep for al|mo&s;t an Hour.
