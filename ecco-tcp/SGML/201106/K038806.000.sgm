<P>I Flatter my&s;elf my friends will readily conceive, when fir&s;t I made the &s;ub&s;equent memorandums, that they were not de&s;igned for the peru&s;al of any other per&s;ons than my two daughters; nor &s;hould I have been tempted to have made them known, had it not been at the earn|e&s;t reque&s;t of a young lady, who, (having the misfortune to lo&s;e her parents when very young, and by a late marriage was removed at a di&s;|tance from her friends,) rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ing (from my having been the mother of &s;even children, &s;he knew I had &s;uckled and &s;uperintended) that experience would have enabled me to give her &s;ome in&s;tructions that might be u&s;eful to her in her con|dition; from tho&s;e con&s;iderations

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I con&s;ider how much your pre&s;ent &s;ituation de|mands the advice of a real friend, I &s;hall exert my en|deavours, though I fear in|adequate to the undertaking, to give you &s;uch in&s;tructions as I am per&s;uaded will tend much to your relief; you very rea&s;onably imagine, in con&s;equence of the natural cour&s;es incident to our &s;ex not appearing at their regular time, that you are breeding; from that circum|&s;tance, I readily &s;uppo&s;e, you have taken particular notice when nature was la&s;t on you; &s;hould you continue without any far|ther alteration, you may begin to reckon from the tenth day after the la&s;t time: this method my mother taught me with my fir&s;t child, and I do a&s;&s;ure you that my midwife
<PB N="4" REF="6">paid her a very high compliment on the oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ri&s;e at your u&s;ual time; and, if you breed &s;ick, (which is u&s;ual,) order a cup of camo|mile-tea, or pump-water, as &s;oon as you come down &s;tairs in the morning; that will help to keep your body open. If tea does not agree with you, try coffee, chocolate, milk, milk-porridge, water-gruel, balm-tea, or a calf's-foot boiled in milk; &s;ome one of which, mo&s;t likely, will.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may have little or no appe|tite early in a morning; if &s;o, give a general order to have &s;omething brought you at eleven o'clock; &s;hould you not be inclined to eat, let it not be removed, for, though it &s;hould not be agreeable then, it may a little time af|terwards.</P>
<P>By no means ever go out hungry; from that cau&s;e the de&s;ire of a per&s;on, for many things they &s;ee, or &s;mell, in general proceeds; to avoid being &s;o, I would wi&s;h you to carry a bi&s;cuit, or &s;omething of that kind, at all times in your pocket. Should you be &s;o un|fortunate
<PB N="5" REF="7">as to mark the child, be not di&s;|couraged, as it will not be of any bad con&s;e|quence, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the receipts at the end of the book.</NOTE> remedy may be applied.</P>
<P>During your pregnancy, &s;hould you chance to meet, or &s;ee, any di&s;agreeable object, &s;uch as lame, blind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do not &s;uffer it to make any impre&s;&s;ion on your mind, as you may then re&s;t a&s;&s;ured it will have no effect on you or the child.</P>
<P>When you are three months advanced, on no account keep it &s;ecret, as many ladies preju|dice them&s;elves thereby; &s;hould you be hot, or feveri&s;h, and frequently &s;ick, it is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould make your condition known to your midwife, (that he may order you, at that time, to lo&s;e a little blood,) other|wi&s;e you may depend upon it you will have &s;ore nipples, or your navel &s;tart; from both tho&s;e circum&s;tances I &s;uffered much, with my fir&s;t child: it therefore behoves you to be particu|larly careful, to avoid tho&s;e inconveniences, and, believe me, you cannot do your&s;elf, or midwife, ju&s;tice to conceal from him or
<PB N="6" REF="8">her your condition; a gentleman will under|&s;tand your meaning at the in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Should your body not be regular every day, eat fruit, vegetables, or a few jar-rai&s;ins.</P>
<P>When you are five months advanced, put on jumps, wear very broad bandages to your upper and under petticoats; &s;ew an eye to the jumps, that they may hook on; by this me|thod you take the weight off the loins: and at this time you &s;hould engage with a nur&s;e.</P>
<P>When turned of &s;ix months, &s;hould feveri&s;h heats, fixt pains in the &s;ide, or any inflamma|tory &s;ymptoms appear, lo&s;e more blood, which will give you immediate relief. Should you perceive your water warmer than u&s;ual, take a table-&s;poonful of gum arabic twice a-day: be &s;ure, at this time, to have your child-bed linen well aired, and put into a large tin-box, in a warm place, for fear of a &s;even-months child, damp linen being particularly hurt|ful; &s;trictly ob&s;erving that napkins are not applied to you, or the child, hot, as they would occa&s;ion a violent inflammation in both.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="9">
<P>As you find your&s;elf grow weighty, lie down between the blankets at lea&s;t three times a-day, to alter the po&s;ture; from which you will find great relief.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to have two motions a-day the two la&s;t months; the la&s;t fortnight you &s;hould drink a gla&s;s of mountain, with a table-&s;poonful of &s;weet oil in it, as it relaxes, and will be of great &s;ervice in labour.</P>
<P>Should you, my dear madam, find your|&s;elf very unea&s;y the latter-part of your time, make not your&s;elf unhappy, as it is mo&s;t pro|bable you will come the quicker and better for it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as you are taken in labour, comb your hair &s;mooth, have an inch cut off be|hind and before, or you will find it comb off very much at the month's end. I know &s;everal ladies who have lo&s;t very fine heads of hair by this omi&s;&s;ion. The next thing, put on your night-cap, which will prove very comfortable: &s;ome ladies will not be per|&s;uaded to it, and, by that means, are very
<PB N="8" REF="10">much di&s;turbed. Four people about you are quite &s;ufficient, the midwife, nur&s;e, and two a&s;&s;i&s;tants; more only heat the room, create confu&s;ion, baulk your pains, and prevent your taking them as you otherwi&s;e would: to prevent flooding, which is too often the ca&s;e, or the fatigue of rai&s;ing your&s;elf up, I would recommend a &s;ilver &s;ucking-&s;pout, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which you may drink without being moved.</P>
<P>A half-&s;hift and body-cloth, with &s;trings, a double napkin to your brea&s;ts, and a &s;ingle wai&s;tcoat, with &s;leeves, to come as low as your elbows, (made by a &s;kilful taylor, as &s;oon as your are with child,) are all that are nece&s;&s;ary; when you &s;it up in your bed, throw a double handkerchief over your neck, and &s;lip on your bed-gown; lie warm, but not hot.</P>
<P>Providence has &s;o ordained it, that a wo|man, with her fir&s;t child, has &s;eldom or ever any after-pains; if you are well, and can eat a bi&s;cuit, or cru&s;t of bread, the minute after delivery, it will keep the wind out of your &s;tomach, and &s;trengthen you very much. Be
<PB N="9" REF="11">&s;ure to have &s;perma-ceti, &s;ugar, and nutmeg, and plenty of very weak brandy and water: and, in a few hours afterwards, a half-pint ba&s;on of barley-jelly; but no caudle, on any con&s;ideration, till the milk has been at the height, and is quite gone off, &s;o that you have not the lea&s;t fever; as, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the milk at that time, according to in&s;truc|tions, you will gain &s;trength very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t twelve days, take of &s;ugar and &s;perma-ceti about one-third of an ounce fre|quently; and, every or every other day, take a quarter of an ounce of manna, as you find occa&s;ion, one motion a day being &s;ufficient; without which, in all probability, you will have a fever, owing to confinement.</P>
<P>You may eat part of a boiled rabbit, chicken, or &s;uch like food, every day for the fir&s;t week; and, about eleven o'clock, in the fore|noon, have &s;ome good broth, beef-tea, or calf's-foot jelly, by way of change, with the barley-jelly; after which time (if you follow my directions) you may live as the family do, provided they dine at one o'clock.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>If your &s;trength will admit, I would wi&s;h you to get up the &s;econd day, to have your bed made; about the fourth or fifth put on your jumps, and pin your gown quite clo&s;e; by attending to that, it will &s;trengthen your back much; and, from that day, endeavour to &s;it up an hour, and &s;o on by degrees, by which means you will recover your &s;trength &s;ooner than you are aware of: the weak &s;tate, ladies in general are reduced to, ari&s;es from lying in bed too long.</P>
<P>The fifth day you may drink half a pint of beer, with a gla&s;s of mountain in it; and, if you have any de&s;ire for chee&s;e, at your din|ner, eat a piece the &s;ize of a nutmeg, after which drink a gla&s;s of port-wine. The &s;eventh or eighth day you may venture to drink beer alone; in that ca&s;e, at and after dinner, drink a gla&s;s of port-wine: &s;ome time after lie down between the blankets, for an hour or more; if you can compo&s;e your&s;elf to re&s;t, it will be of great &s;ervice. In this manner you &s;hould proceed the fir&s;t three weeks; during which time always breakfa&s;t in bed, and lie two hours after; before you ri&s;e be &s;ure to have &s;omething warm.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="13">
<P>Dine at one o'clock, and by no means drink tea later than five; for, if you do, it will inter|fere with the undre&s;&s;ing your child and getting your &s;upper.</P>
<P>Between your tea and &s;even o'clock drink a little warm jelly, or a gla&s;s of wine with a cru&s;t of bread; otherwi&s;e, undre&s;&s;ing your child and &s;uckling will be too great a fatigue. Sup at nine o'clock, and be in bed by ten; af|ter that time do not &s;uffer any per&s;on to come into your room, as it will di&s;turb you, and very likely prevent your &s;leeping.</P>
<P>Avoid &s;eeing much company; for the weak &s;tate you may probably be in will not admit of it: &s;hould you be &s;o, attend to this for the fir&s;t three weeks, by which means you will regain your &s;trength &s;ooner.</P>
<P>When your month is up, and you are able to go abroad, I earne&s;tly recommend you to ob&s;erve, that if, by any means, you have been prevent|ed &s;uckling for &s;ix, eight, or ten, hours, which will &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e, you will u&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tant in&s;tead of applying the child; &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="14">your exerci&s;e have thrown you into a per&s;pi|ration, however gentle, make water, put a|nother cloak on, and drink &s;omething warm; the milk then will be fre&s;h and good: &s;hould it not have vented it&s;elf in &s;uch a number of hours, you will be convinced, by its &s;melling offen&s;ively, that it mu&s;t be hurtful to the infant; and without tho&s;e preparations the countenance will immediately turn pale, cau&s;e it to cry, have a &s;tool, or perhaps both; and then it is the blood gets foul: by this omi&s;&s;ion I lo&s;t a fine boy, four months old. As every di&s;a|greeable eircum&s;tance injures the milk; if your brea&s;ts are hard, and overful, be a&s;&s;ured you have taken cold, which is impo&s;&s;ible to be avoided without great precaution; and thus numbers of children, by the foulne&s;s of the milk, have been thrown into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have great rea&s;on to believe, had I not drawn my brea&s;ts at lea&s;t four&s;core times, with each of my two la&s;t children, I &s;hould not have been able to have reared them, from trouble of mind, fatigue, and cold.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="15">
<HEAD>THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INFANT.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the treatment of your in|fant, though it be your reque&s;t that I &s;hould offer my advice, yet I do not pre&s;ume to dictate to your midwife, as I very much ap|prove of their method in general; however, I have no doubt that, by pur&s;uing the following directions, great advantage will be found.</P>
<P>As to the dre&s;s, it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of a belly|band, made of a piece of fine linen cloth, dou|bled about three fingers wide; when the navel|&s;tring is off, put it &s;ingle; when quite well, leave it off, as the &s;hirt with &s;trings an|&s;wers that purpo&s;e; a blanket, a &s;hort loo&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="16">roller, a little gown, and one cap; a long &s;tay may be made u&s;e of, if you think proper, but not continued more than three weeks, either night or day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the child is dre&s;&s;ed, I would have you give it of &s;yrup of mar&s;h-mallows and oil of &s;weet almonds two tea-&s;poonfuls of each, mixed together, which clean&s;es more than &s;ugar and butter; as the former &s;ticks to the mouth, cau&s;es &s;ore nipples, and fre|quently throws children into the watery gripes.</P>
<P>In the next place, the child &s;hould be put to the brea&s;t; if the milk cannot be obtained, let it be fed with beef-tea, without &s;ugar; &s;hould it be, even in that ca&s;e it mu&s;t be fed with the tea three times a-day, for a &s;ucking-child requires victuals oftener than you are aware of; if it continues to &s;uck, the milk will clean&s;e it &s;ufficiently; &s;hould it not, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give it three do&s;es of phy&s;ic, by your doctor's or apothecary's order; as I I am per&s;uaded few nur&s;es under&s;tand enough of drugs to clean&s;e it properly.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<P>Should you have overheated your&s;elf, had any uncommon unea&s;ine&s;s during your preg|nancy, or you or your hu&s;band have any hu|mours in your blood, lay a bli&s;ter on as &s;oon as the child is born. I am well acquainted with an eminent and &s;kiful midwife who never brings a child into the world without applying one before it is dre&s;&s;ed, and orders gum-arabic, about a tea-&s;poonful at a time, to be given di&s;cretionally into its victuals or alone.</P>
<P>On the eleventh day, as &s;oon as the child is dre&s;&s;ed, to a pap-&s;poonful of purifying lo|tion add &s;ix drops of each of the head tinc|tures, with which the head, forehead, eye|brows, neck, throat, loins, and knees, &s;hould be rubbed well; it will give &s;pirits and &s;trength to the infant, and may be u&s;ed with &s;afety, &s;ick or well; be careful to dry the head, and as &s;oon as done put on the cap, not u&s;ing pomatum on any account. Children, in common, have a great deal of weak hair; by pur&s;uing this method every day, it will either take it off at the month's end, or give &s;trength and make it grow: it will clean&s;e an infant's head in ten days, &s;hould it have ever
<PB N="16" REF="18">&s;o great a quantity of white or yellow &s;curf, without the lea&s;t hazard of giving the child cold.</P>
<P>The mi&s;-management of childrens heads, in general, induced me to try the experiment on one of my own, by which means I made the di&s;covery; I therefore &s;trongly recom|mend it to you, as I am per&s;uaded it will be of great &s;ervice to your child, and will pre|vent the fever in the head mo&s;t children are &s;ubject to from improper treatment.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;orders incident to an in|fant, in the month, viz. the red-gum and thru&s;h; the latter &s;hould be very clo&s;ely watch|ed for, that it may be &s;ent through as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If the child is &s;ubject to the hicup, which is a &s;pecies of convul&s;ions, and proceeds from the wind getting into the &s;tomach, it &s;hould be put to the brea&s;t, that it may &s;uck it away; if it neither will nor can, give it &s;ome warm beef-tea.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="19">
<P>At the end of three weeks I would have you coat the child, which, with the &s;tay, &s;hould be half a yard in length: the &s;hirt to be one inch longer, and the frock rather longer than the re&s;t; they &s;hould all tie behind, by which means you may put on the dre&s;s in a minute. Feed your child as directed, keep it to regu|lar hours, and cool in the night; you will then have little trouble, about that time, Should the child be well, it will then endea|vour to &s;tep up the nur&s;e's &s;tomach, and get on her head. Is it not then ab&s;urd that it &s;hould be clothed in &s;uch a manner as to deprive it of the proper u&s;e of its limbs? which it often is, from the common mode of dre&s;&s;ing, at lea&s;t &s;ix months. How did our fir&s;t pa|rents &s;helter them&s;elves from cold? The Scrip|ture tells us they came naked into the world, and, had they not touched the forbidden fruit, they would never have known the want of clothing. Nature points out to us to keep our&s;elves cool: the great folly of childrens wearing long clothes, I attribute to a mi&s;taken notion, taken from that pa&s;&s;age in the Scrip|ture, where we are told <Q>"Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was wrapped in &s;wadling clothes, and laid
<PB N="18" REF="20">in a manger, as there was no other room for him in the inn."</Q> At that time the rea|&s;on was ju&s;t, being the depth of winter: but &s;urely there can be none given now for cloth|ing a child &s;o hot, who is confined for the fir&s;t month, and, for the mo&s;t part, a quarter of a year, either to the lying-in room or nur&s;ery; which, in general, may be more properly compared to a bagnio than any other place.</P>
<P>When you take an infant of three weeks old in your arms, &s;it as upright in your chair as if at your harp&s;ichord; from that po&s;ition you will have the full u&s;e of your arms; dance it from thigh to thigh, which you will find gives it a notion of &s;tepping. That you may not be at a lo&s;s after your nur&s;e has left you, when the child is at the brea&s;t, avoid talking loud, as it affrights and makes it quit it; &s;hould you have done &s;o by chance, &s;peak in a low tone of voice, it will look up in your face, &s;mile, and, in all probability, &s;uck again.</P>
<P>The time of day an infant is dre&s;&s;ed, in general, is about eleven or twelve o'clock, which I look upon to be an improper one; it &s;hould be early in a morning, as it not only
<PB N="19" REF="21">tires, but refre&s;hes, and gives it an appetite to its breakfa&s;t: when fini&s;hed, if not &s;leepy, &s;end it into the air. I mean at that &s;ea&s;on of the year when the &s;hortne&s;s of the days, and the inclemency of the weather, will otherwi&s;e prevent its enjoying the benefit of it at a proper time of day: in &s;ummer it is not material.</P>
<P>At &s;ix weeks old it &s;hould have no other co|vering, to &s;leep in, but a &s;hirt, and a little &s;hift, or bed-gown, half an ell long; &s;hould it not be kept cool, as much &s;trength will be lo&s;t in one night as gained in two days.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;taken opinion that an infant will &s;leep the fir&s;t quarter; &s;ome may, but, believe me, it is not natural. The fir&s;t four months being the time to give them a notion of their feet; at &s;ix weeks, if you &s;uffer the child to &s;tand on your left thigh, you will find it &s;hove forwards, and put out its fee to &s;tep; you may then with &s;afety put on the Nur&s;e's-Relief, which I have &s;o contrived, that it takes off the whole weight of the child, and may be worn at all times. It grieves me to hear parent de&s;ire the nur&s;e to take the child; it is &s;o heavy &s;he cannot hold it. In ju&s;tice to your&s;elf and it,
<PB N="20" REF="22">to which particular attendance mu&s;t and &s;hould be given for the fir&s;t twelve months, which will fully employ the time of any one per&s;on; by that means you will, in all proba|bility, have your child out of arms in that time; on the contrary it may be almo&s;t two years. You will ea&s;ily judge, by taking it into your arms occa&s;ionally, whether it is properly nur&s;ed or not.</P>
<P>Some ladies are &s;o particular that they think a child &s;hould not be &s;et on its feet till expi|ration of the fir&s;t eight months, which is a fal&s;e notion; for, as I ob&s;erved before, the fir&s;t four months the child &s;hould exerci&s;e its limbs; after that time (and in many children before) the teeth are &s;hooting into the gums, and that is often attended with wor&s;e con&s;equences than actual t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">thing it&s;elf; becau&s;e an infant is &s;ubject to the &s;trangury; and a parent's not knowing or con&s;idering that circum&s;tance is what occa&s;ions children to be taken off, from the age of four months to three years old; an in&s;tance of which I will give you.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who takes in children to nur&s;e, who&s;e hou&s;e I had occa&s;ion frequently to pa&s;s,
<PB N="21" REF="23">taking notice of my little boy, then in arms, led me naturally to enquire after her nur&s;ing child, whom I had often &s;een, and remark|ed to have been a fine boy: the poor wo|man dropped a tear, and &s;aid the child was dead. The agitation of mind &s;he then ap|peared to be in would not permit me to a&s;k any other que&s;tions; but, as I was pa&s;&s;ing in the evening, I took the opportunity, while &s;he was &s;tanding at the door, of enquiring if he had been long ill; &s;he &s;aid he had not: and what age he was, about five months; and had two teeth looked &s;o blue, that &s;he had no doubt would have been cut the next day, which led me farther to a&s;k concerning the child's wa|ter. Fir&s;t, whether &s;he perceived any &s;top|page; &s;econdly, if he cried before he made any; and thirdly, when he did, if it was not extremely hot; really, &s;aid the woman, I did not take &s;ufficient notice. Another per&s;on, who occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and was then confined to her bed, in the next room, (over|hearing the conver&s;ation,) de&s;ired I would walk in, when &s;he informed me &s;he recollect|ed that the child not only cried when it made water, but that the water was &s;o extremely
<PB N="22" REF="24">hot it almo&s;t fleed him; but that is common. They then &s;ent for the apothecary, but, before he could come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the child was carried off in a fit, occa&s;ioned by the &s;trangury, which he, being unacquainted with, directly pronounced it to be occa&s;ioned by the two teeth.</P>
<P>As a farther proof, I will give you an in|&s;tance of a child of twenty weeks old, I was called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n by a neighbour to look at, whom I found in a violent fit of crying, in which it had been about two hours; ob&s;erving the child's knees drawn up to its chin induced me to a&s;k if it had made water in that time; I was told it had not. In about an hour after I look|ed in again, and found the child in a &s;ound &s;leep; upon enquiry, I was told he had been very unea&s;y before he made water, but, as &s;oon as he had, it relieved him, and he be|came compo&s;ed; and, as in the ca&s;e before|mentioned, his thighs were almo&s;t fleed by the heat of its water; in con&s;equence of which I advi&s;ed her to give it &s;ome gum-arabic water, which had the de&s;ired effect. The following day &s;he perceived two under teeth look blue, which I recommended her to rub with a gold ring; &s;he did, and they came
<PB N="23" REF="25">through with great ea&s;e, encouraged by the gum-arabic, carrying the fever off, by urine, incident to tho&s;e ca&s;es. She has continued it ever &s;ince in every thing he eats and drinks; and he is now a fine boy: his grand-mother is of opinion that his life was &s;aved by that means. In order to keep the mouth cool, when you perceive the child about its teeth, the fir&s;t thing given it in a morning &s;hould be a tea-&s;poonful of cold &s;pring water.</P>
<P>Every mother or nur&s;e &s;hould con&s;tantly feel the child's pul&s;e once every day, that &s;he may judge whether it is in health or not: for my own part, though I do not profe&s;s any &s;kill, yet, by accu&s;toming my&s;elf to this me|thod, feeling the water, and examining the &s;tools, I am able to &s;orm a better judgement than mo&s;t people would imagine. I am in|debted to a very eminent phy&s;ician for this hint, and I do verily believe it is a very e&s;&s;en|tial one to any who have the care of an infant.</P>
<P>If a child's water appears of the colour of milk, neglect not to give it the gum-arabic three or four times a day, as you may be a&s;|&s;ured it has either caught cold or is about its
<PB N="24" REF="26">double teeth; in either ca&s;e it has been found of great u&s;e, unle&s;s it operates as a purgative, which is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e; if it does, o|mit it a day or two.</P>
<P>Some little time after the foregoing ob&s;er|vations, I met a gentleman of the faculty, (the father of a large family,) who&s;e opinion I a&s;ked concerning a child's having the &s;trangu|ry, and at what age; he &s;aid at or about two years old. The earne&s;t manner in which I put the que&s;tion to him, I &s;uppo&s;e, led him to a&s;k me whether I had rea&s;on, from the ex|perience I had had in attending my own chil|dren, to imagine it appeared before; I e|vaded the que&s;tion, as at that time it did not &s;uit me to make the confe&s;&s;ion, knowing it would be of great advantage to every per&s;on that purcha&s;ed a Nur&s;e's-Relief of me, as I then intended to make a point of convincing them how nece&s;&s;ary it is for a parent or nur&s;e to have the gum-arabic water by them the fir&s;t three years, as few children cut all their double teeth &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Should the child frequently heave, when the &s;tomach is oppre&s;&s;ed, which is common
<PB N="25" REF="27">from &s;ix weeks to four or five months old, &s;end for your apothecary, that he may order &s;omething for its relief; otherwi&s;e, by not checking the di&s;order in time, you will mo&s;t likely throw the infant into convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is very ab&s;urd for any one to imagine the faculty do not under&s;tand the di&s;orders inci|dent to infants: in many in&s;tances you will find their opinion requi&s;ite; &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, I earne&s;tly entreat you will make it a rule to a&s;k in what manner he expects the medicines to operate: they will all acquaint you; but &s;ome, through hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, omit it, by which they are often under the nece&s;|&s;ity of attending a &s;econd time, to &s;atisfy the doubts and fears of the nur&s;e, who, from the child's having two or three motions in an hour, and perhaps frequently &s;ick, alarms her&s;elf with apprehen&s;ion of danger; though, at the &s;ame time, it may be quite nece&s;&s;ary, and the infant could not be relieved without.</P>
<P>I was greatly alarmed in a &s;imilar ca&s;e with my la&s;t child, and &s;hould have been more &s;o, had it not been for my mother, who told me the medicine, the apothecary &s;ent, would take
<PB N="26" REF="28">the effect as above mentioned: or, probably, by means of the fright, I might have lo&s;t my milk; in&s;tances of which have been frequent; as &s;oon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you have given the medicines, (for they do not always operate alike,) put a dou|ble napkin round its ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, and lay it in your lap at lea&s;t an hour; it po&s;&s;ibly may fall a|&s;leep; if &s;o, the better; and it is a great chance, when it awakes, if it be not &s;ick, or have a motion; perhaps both: it may otherwi&s;e pa&s;s off by urine; in which ca&s;e, &s;hould it be a little convul&s;ed, do not alarm your&s;elf, as it will not be of any bad con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Should the child be in a cold clammy &s;weat, do not let it make you unea&s;y. Apply warm napkins to the neck, face, hands, and bottom; lay your hand on the navel, and gent|ly rub the &s;tomach, carefully avoiding to over|heat the child; as &s;oon as it is ea&s;y it will re|ward your tender care with a plea&s;ing &s;mile; endeavour to compo&s;e it, and then you may, with &s;afety, put it in the bed or cradle, taking care not to di&s;turb it on any con&s;ideration: &s;hould it &s;leep five, &s;ix, or eight, hours, be &s;ure, in that time, to draw your brea&s;ts twice,
<PB N="27" REF="29">as more children &s;uffer by that omi&s;&s;ion than you are aware of: among the number, I lo&s;t a fine boy of my own, four months old, by that neglect.</P>
<P>When your child is five months old, pro|vided you follow my directions, you may put it into a go-cart, which I am per&s;uaded will be found very convenient; after it is in, tie the cart to the leg of a table or chair; conti|nue it thus for a fortnight, that it may feel its feet properly; it will take great plea&s;ure in &s;tanding &s;o: if you do not ob&s;erve this cau|tion, but &s;uffer the cart to run on the floor at fir&s;t, it may very likely intimidate the child, and give it a di&s;like to it. I have given direc|tions for one to be made with a flag to it, to encourage the child to &s;tand upright; and a chair on a different con&s;truction from tho&s;e made u&s;e of in common, of which I very much di&s;approve, as they are too great a con|finement.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved by my own children, when ill, that they have frequently taken a little warm victuals or drink, becau&s;e the fatigue of
<PB N="28" REF="30">&s;ucking has been too great; but, as &s;oon as a child finds it&s;elf ea&s;y, it will readily receive the nouri&s;hment from the brea&s;t, de&s;igned by nature. When you take the child out of the cradle or off the bed, after &s;leeping, it &s;hould not be &s;et on its feet immediately, as it is apt to make it cro&s;s; the feeble &s;tate we our|&s;elves are in, on our fir&s;t getting out of bed, plainly &s;hews the utility of the above caution; you will therefore do well to &s;et the child in its chair, and divert it for five minutes; after that time it may, with &s;afety, be allow|ed to go to play.</P>
<P>I do not approve of a back-&s;tring; nor do I allow a child to run alone till it can get up of it&s;elf, after falling: neither do I &s;uffer any body to take it off the ground, when young; &s;hould you accu&s;tom them to that, they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie and &s;cream till you do; on the contrary, if no notice is taken, they will get up of them|&s;elves, go to play, and not mind a fall &s;o much, even if an accident happened by it.</P>
<P>I hope by the&s;e in&s;tructions, which you have from under my hand, you will be a bet|ter
