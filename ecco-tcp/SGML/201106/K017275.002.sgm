<HEAD>THE BIRTH-DAY PRESENT.</HEAD>
<P>"MAMMA," &s;aid Ro&s;amond, after a long &s;ilence, "do you know, what I have been thinking of all this time?"</P>
<P>"No, my dear.&mdash;What?"</P>
<P>"Why, mamma, about my cou&s;in Bell's birth-day; do you know what day it is?"</P>
<P>"No, I don't remember."</P>
<P>"Dear mother! don't you re|member its the 22d of December; and her birth-day is the day after to - morrow?&mdash;Don't you recollect now? But you never remember
<PB N="2" REF="3">about birth-days, mamma: that was ju&s;t what I was thinking of, that you never remember my &s;i&s;ter Laura's birth-day, or&mdash;or&mdash;or <HI>mine,</HI> mamma."</P>
<P>"What do you mean, my dear? I remember your birth-day perfectly well."</P>
<P>"Indeed! but you never <HI>keep</HI> it though."</P>
<P>"What do you mean by keeping your birth-day?"</P>
<P>"Oh, mamma, you know very well&mdash;as Bell's birth-day is kept.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place there is a great dinner."</P>
<P>"And can Bell eat more upon her birth-day than upon any other day?"</P>
<P>"No; nor I &s;hould not mind about the dinner, except the mince pies. But Bell has a great many nice things; I don't mean nice eat|able
<PB N="3" REF="4">things, but nice new playthings given to her always on her birth-day; and every body drinks her health, and &s;he's &s;o happy."</P>
<P>"But &s;tay, Ro&s;amond, how you jumble things together! Is it every body's drinking her health that makes her &s;o happy; or the new playthings, or the nice mince pies? I can ea&s;ily believe that &s;he is happy whil&s;t &s;he is eating a mince pie, or whil&s;t &s;he is playing; but how does every body's drinking her health at dinner make her happy?"</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond pau&s;ed, and then &s;aid &s;he did not know. "But," added &s;he, "the <HI>nice new</HI> playthings, mo|ther!"</P>
<P>"But why the nice <HI>new</HI> play|things? Did you like them only becau&s;e they were <HI>new?"</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
"Not <HI>only&mdash;I</HI> do not like play|things <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e they are new, but Bell <HI>does</HI> I believe&mdash;for that puts me in mind&mdash;Do you know, mo|ther, &s;he had a great drawer full of <HI>old</HI> playthings that &s;he never u&s;ed, and &s;he &s;aid that they were good for nothing becau&s;e they were <HI>old;</HI> but I thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones.&mdash;Now you &s;hall be judge, mamma; I'll tell you all that was in the drawer."</P>
<P>"Nay, Ro&s;amond, thank you, not ju&s;t now; I have not time to li&s;ten to you."</P>
<P>"Well then, mamma, the day after to-morrow I can &s;hew you the drawer: I want you to be judge very much, becau&s;e I am &s;ure I was in the right.&mdash;And, mother," added Ro&s;amond, &s;topping her as &s;he was
<PB N="5" REF="6">going out of the room, "will you&mdash;not not now, but when you've time&mdash;will you tell me why you never keep my birth-day&mdash;why you never make any difference between that day and any other day?"</P>
<P>"And will you, Ro&s;amond&mdash;not now, but when you have time to think about it&mdash;tell me why I &s;hould make any difference between your birth-day and any other day?"</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond thought&mdash;but &s;he could not find out any rea&s;on: be&s;ides, &s;he &s;uddenly recollected that &s;he had not time to think any longer, for there was a certain work ba&s;ket to be fini&s;hed, which &s;he was making for her cou&s;in Bell, as a pre&s;ent upon her birth-day. The work was at a &s;tand for want of &s;ome filigree paper, and as her mother was going out &s;he a&s;ked her to take her with her, that
<PB N="6" REF="7">&s;he might buy &s;ome.&mdash;Her &s;i&s;ter Laura went with them.</P>
<P>"Si&s;ter," &s;aid Ro&s;amond, as they were walking along, "what have you done with your half-guinea?"</P>
<P>"I have it in my pocket."</P>
<P>"Dear! you will keep it for ever in your pocket: you know my god|mother when &s;he gave it to you &s;aid you would keep it longer than I &s;hould keep mine; and I know what &s;he thought by her look at the time.&mdash;I heard her &s;ay &s;omething to my mother."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Laura, &s;miling, "&s;he whi&s;pered &s;o loud that I could not help hearing her too: &s;he &s;aid I was a little mi&s;er."</P>
<P>"But did not you hear her &s;ay that I was very <HI>generous?</HI> and &s;he'll &s;ee that &s;he was not mi&s;taken.&mdash;I hope &s;he'll be by when I give my
<PB N="7" REF="8">ba&s;ket to Bell&mdash;won't it be beautiful?&mdash;there is to be a wreath of myrtle, you know, round the handle, and a fro&s;t ground, and then the medal|lions&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Stay," interrupted her &s;i&s;ter; for Ro&s;amond, anticipating the glo|ries of her work-ba&s;ket, talked and walked &s;o fa&s;t, that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, without perceiving it, the &s;hop where the filigree paper was to be bought.&mdash;They turned back. Now it hap|pened that the &s;hop was the corner hou&s;e of a &s;treet, and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane: a coach full of ladies &s;topped at the door ju&s;t before they went in, &s;o that no one had time immediately to think of Ro&s;amond and her fili|gree paper, and &s;he went to the win|dow, where &s;he &s;aw that her &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="8" REF="9">Laura was looking earne&s;tly at &s;ome|thing that was pa&s;&s;ing in the lane.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the window, at the door of a poor looking hou&s;e, there was &s;itting a little girl weaving lace. Her bobbins moved as quick as lightning and &s;he never once looked up from her work.</P>
<P>"Is not &s;he very indu&s;trious?" &s;aid Laura; "and very hone&s;t too," added &s;he in a minute afterwards; for ju&s;t then, a baker with a ba&s;ket of rolls on his head pa&s;&s;ed, and by accident one of the rolls fell clo&s;e to the little girl: &s;he took it up eagerly, looked at it as if &s;he was very hun|gry, then put a&s;ide her work, and ran after the baker to return it to him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was gone, a footman in a livery laced with &s;ilver, who be|longed to the coach that &s;tood at the
<PB N="9" REF="10">&s;hop door, as he was lounging with one of his companions, chanced to &s;py the weaving pillow, which &s;he had left upon a &s;tone before the door. To divert him&s;elf (for idle people do mi&s;chief often to divert them|&s;elves) he took up the pillow, and entangled all the bobbins. The little girl came back out of breath to her work; but what was her &s;uprize and &s;orrow to find it &s;poiled: &s;he twi&s;ted and untwi&s;ted, placed and replaced the bobbins, whil&s;t the footman &s;tood laughing at her di&s;tre&s;s. She got up gently, and was retiring into the hou&s;e, when the &s;ilver-laced footman &s;topped her, &s;aying in&s;olently&mdash;"Sit &s;till, child."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t go to my mother, &s;ir," &s;aid the child; "be&s;ides, you have &s;poiled all my lace&mdash;I can't &s;tay."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
"Can't you," &s;aid the brutal footman, &s;natching her weaving pil|low again; "I'll teach you to complain of me." And he broke off, one after another, all the bob|bins, put them in his pocket, rolled her weaving pillow down the dirty lane, then jumped up behind his mi&s;tre&s;s's coach, and was out of &s;ight in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"Poor girl!" exclaimed Ro&s;a|mond, no longer able to re&s;train her indignation at this inju&s;tice: "Poor little girl!"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant her mother &s;aid to Ro&s;amond&mdash;"Come now, my dear, if you want this filigree paper buy it."</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," &s;aid Ro&s;amond; and the idea of what her godmother and her cou&s;in Bell would think of her genero&s;ity, ru&s;hed again upon
<PB N="11" REF="12">her imagination. All her feelings of pity were immediately &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Satisfied with be&s;towing another ex|clamation upon the <HI>"Poor little girl,"</HI> &s;he went to &s;pend her half-guinea upon her filigree ba&s;ket. In the mean time &s;he that was called the <HI>"little mi&s;er,"</HI> beckoned to the poor girl, and opening the window &s;aid, pointing to the cu&s;hion, "Is it quite &s;poiled?"</P>
<P>"Quite! quite &s;poiled! and I can't, nor mother neither, buy ano|ther: and I can't do any thing el&s;e for my bread."&mdash;A few, but very few, tears fell as &s;he &s;aid this.</P>
<P>"How much would another co&s;t?" &s;aid Laura.</P>
<P>"Oh, a great&mdash;<HI>great</HI> deal."</P>
<P>"More than that?" &s;aid Laura, holding up her half-guinea.</P>
<P>"Oh, no."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
"Then you can buy another with that," &s;aid Laura, dropping the half|guinea into her hand, and &s;he &s;hut the window before the child could find words to thank her; but not before &s;he &s;aw a look of joy and gratitude, which gave Laura more plea&s;ure probably than all the prai&s;e which could have been be&s;towed upon her genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Late on the morning of her cou|&s;in's birth day, Ro&s;amond fini&s;hed her work-ba&s;ket. The carriage was at the door&mdash;Laura came run|ning to call her; her father's voice was heard at the &s;ame in&s;tant; &s;o &s;he was obliged to go down with her ba&s;ket but half wrapped up in &s;ilver paper, a circum&s;tance at which &s;he was a good deal di&s;concerted; for the plea&s;ure of &s;urpri&s;ing Bell would be utterly lo&s;t if one bit of the fili|gree
<PB N="13" REF="14">&s;hould peep out before the pro|per time. As the carriage went on, Ro&s;amond pulled the paper to one &s;ide and to the other, and by each of the four corners.</P>
<P>"It will never do, my dear," &s;aid her father, who had been watch|ing her operations; "I am afraid you will never make a &s;heet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"It is not a box, father," &s;aid Ro&s;amond, a little peevi&s;hly; "its a ba&s;ket."</P>
<P>"Let us look at this ba&s;ket," &s;aid he, taking it out of her unwilling hands; for &s;he knew of what frail materials it was made, and &s;he dreaded its coming to pieces under her father's examination.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
He took hold of the handle rather roughly, and &s;tarting off the coach &s;eat, &s;he cried&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh, &s;ir! father! &s;ir! you will &s;poil it indeed!" &s;aid &s;he with en|crea&s;ed vehemence, when, after drawing a&s;ide the veil of &s;ilver paper, &s;he &s;aw him gra&s;p the myrtle-wreathed handle.</P>
<P>"Indeed, &s;ir, you will &s;poil the poor handle."</P>
<P>"But what is the u&s;e of <HI>the poor handle,"</HI> &s;aid her father, "if we are not to take hold of it? And pray," continued he, turning the ba&s;ket round with his finger and thumb, rather in a di&s;re&s;pectful manner&mdash;"pray is this the thing you have been about all this week? I have &s;een you all this week dabbling with pa&s;te and rags, I could not conceive what you were about&mdash;Is this the thing?"</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
"Yes, &s;ir&mdash;You think then that I have wa&s;ted my time, becau&s;e the ba&s;ket is of no u&s;e: but then it is for a pre&s;ent for my cou&s;in Bell."</P>
<P>"Your cou&s;in Bell will be very much obliged to you for a pre&s;ent that is of no u&s;e; you had better have given her the purple jar."</P>
<P>"Oh, father! I thought you had forgotten that&mdash;it was two years ago; I'm not &s;o &s;illy now. But Bell will like the ba&s;ket I know, though it is of no u&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then you think Bell is &s;illier <HI>now,</HI> than you were two years ago.&mdash;Well, perhaps that is true; but how comes it, Ro&s;amond, now that you are &s;o wi&s;e, that you are fond of &s;uch a &s;illy per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"<HI>I,</HI> father?" &s;aid Ro&s;amond, he&s;itating; "I don't think I am <HI>very</HI> fond of her."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
"I did not &s;ay <HI>very</HI> fond."</P>
<P>"Well, but I don't think I am at all fond of her."</P>
<P>"But you have &s;pent a whole week in making this thing for her."</P>
<P>"Yes, and all my half-guinea be&s;ides."</P>
<P>"Yet you think her &s;illy, and you are not fond of her at all; and you &s;ay you know this thing will be of no u&s;e to her."</P>
<P>"But it is her birth-day, &s;ir; and I am &s;ure &s;he will <HI>expect</HI> &s;omething, and every body el&s;e will give her &s;omething."</P>
<P>"Then your rea&s;ons for giving are becau&s;e &s;he expects you to give her &s;omething. And will you, or can you, or &s;hould you always give, merely becau&s;e others <HI>expect,</HI> or be|cau&s;e &s;omebody el&s;e gives?"</P>
<P>"Always!&mdash;no, not always."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
"Oh, only on birth-days."</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond, laughing, "Now you are making a joke of me, papa, I &s;ee; but I thought you liked that people &s;hould be generous&mdash;my god|mother &s;aid that &s;he did."</P>
<P>"So do I, full as well as your godmother; but we have not yet quite &s;ettled what it is to be gene|rous."</P>
<P>"Why, is it not generous to make pre&s;ents?" &s;aid Ro&s;amond.</P>
<P>"That is a que&s;tion which it would take up a great deal of time to an&s;wer.&mdash;But, for in&s;tance, to make a pre&s;ent of a thing that you know can be of no u&s;e, to a per&s;on you neither love nor e&s;teem, becau&s;e it is her birth-day, and becau&s;e every body gives her &s;omething, and be|cau&s;e &s;he expects &s;omething, and be|cau&s;e your godmother &s;ays &s;he likes
<PB N="18" REF="19">that people &s;hould be generous, &s;eems to me, my dear Ro&s;amond, to be, &s;ince I mu&s;t &s;ay it, rather more like folly than genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond looked down upon the ba&s;ket, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Then I am a fool! am I?" &s;aid &s;he, looking up at la&s;t.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e you have made <HI>one</HI> mi&s;take?&mdash;No. If you have &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee your own mi&s;takes, and can afterwards avoid them, you will never be a fool."</P>
<P>Here the carriage &s;topped, and Ro&s;amond recollected that the ba&s;ket was uncovered.</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that Ro|&s;amond's father had not been too &s;evere upon Bell when he called her a &s;illy girl.&mdash;From her infancy &s;he had been humoured; and at eight years old &s;he had the misfortune to
<PB N="19" REF="20">be a &s;poiled child: &s;he was idle, fretful and &s;elfi&s;h, &s;o that nothing could make her happy. On her birth-day &s;he expected, however, to be perfectly happy. Every body in the hou&s;e tried to plea&s;e her, and they &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that between breakfa&s;t and dinner &s;he had only &s;ix fits of crying. The cau&s;e of five of the&s;e fits no one could di&s;cover; but the la&s;t, and mo&s;t lamentable, was occa&s;ioned by a di&s;appointment about a worked mu&s;lin frock. Her mother had promi&s;ed her a new frock, and accordingly at dre&s;&s;ing|time her maid brought it to her, ex|claiming&mdash;"See here mi&s;s! what your mamma has &s;ent you on your birth-day&mdash;Here's a frock fit for a queen&mdash;if it had but lace round the cuffs."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
"And why has not it lace round the cuffs? mamma &s;aid it &s;hould."</P>
<P>"Yes, but mi&s;tre&s;s was di&s;ap|pointed about the lace; it is not come home."</P>
<P>"Not come home, indeed! and didn't they know it was my birth|day? But then I &s;ay I won't wear it without the lace&mdash;I can't wear it without the lace&mdash;and I won't."</P>
<P>The lace, however, could not be had; and Bell at length &s;ubmitted to let the frock be put on. "Come, Mi&s;s Bell, dry your eyes," &s;aid the maid who <HI>educated</HI> her; "dry your eyes, and I'll tell you &s;omething that will plea&s;e you."</P>
<P>"What, then?" &s;aid the child, pouting and &s;obbing.</P>
<P>"Why&mdash;but you mu&s;t not tell that I told you."</P>
<P>"No&mdash;but if I am a&s;ked?"</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
"Why, if you are a&s;ked, you mu&s;t tell the truth to be &s;ure.&mdash;So I'll hold my tongue, mi&s;s."</P>
<P>"Nay, tell me though, and I'll never tell&mdash;if I <HI>am</HI> a&s;ked."</P>
<P>"Well, then," &s;aid the maid, "your cou&s;in Ro&s;amond is come, and has brought you the mo&s;t <HI>beau|tifulle&s;t</HI> thing you ever &s;aw in your life; but you are not to know any thing about it till after dinner, be|cau&s;e &s;he wants to &s;urpri&s;e you; and mi&s;tre&s;s has put it in her wardrobe till after dinner."</P>
<P>"Till after dinner!" repeated Bell, impatiently; "I can't wait till then, I mu&s;t &s;ee it this minute."</P>
<P>The maid refu&s;ed her &s;everal times, till Bell bur&s;t into another fit of crying, and the maid, fearing that her mi&s;tre&s;s would be angry with <HI>her,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="23">if Bell's eyes were red at dinner-time, con&s;ented to &s;hew her the ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>"How pretty!&mdash;But let me have it in my own hands." &s;aid Bell as the maid held the ba&s;ket up out of her reach.</P>
<P>"Oh no, you mu&s;t not touch it; for if you &s;hould &s;poil it what would become of me?"</P>
<P>"Become of you, indeed!" ex|claimed the &s;poiled child, who never con&s;idered any thing but her own immediate gratification&mdash;"Become of <HI>you,</HI> indeed! what &s;ignifies that&mdash;I &s;han't &s;poil it; and I will have it in my own hands.&mdash;If you don't hold it down for me directly, I'll tell that you &s;hewed it to me."</P>
<P>"Then you won't &s;natch it?"</P>
<P>"No, no, I won't indeed," &s;aid Bell; but &s;he had learned from her maid a total di&s;regard of truth.&mdash;
<PB N="23" REF="24">She &s;natched the ba&s;ket the moment it was within her reach; a &s;truggle en&s;ued, in which the handle and lid were torn off, and one of the me|dallions cru&s;hed inwards, before the little fury returned to her &s;en&s;es. Calmed at this &s;ight, the next que&s;|tion was, how &s;he &s;hould conceal the mi&s;chief which &s;he had done. After many attempts the handle and lid were replaced, the ba&s;ket was put exactly in the &s;ame &s;pot in which it had &s;tood before, and the maid charged the child "<HI>to look as if no|thing was the matter."</HI></P>
<P>We hope that both children and parents will here pau&s;e for a moment to reflect.&mdash;The habits of tyranny, meanne&s;s, and fal&s;ehood, which chil|dren acquire from living with bad &s;ervants, are &s;carcely ever conquered
<PB N="24" REF="25">in the whole cour&s;e of their future lives.</P>
<P>After &s;hutting up the ba&s;ket they left the room, and in the adjoining pa&s;&s;age they found a poor girl wait|ing with a &s;mall parcel in her hand.</P>
<P>"What's your bu&s;ine&s;s?" &s;aid the maid.</P>
<P>"I have brought home the lace, madam, that was be&s;poke for the young lady."</P>
<P>"Oh, you have, have you, at la&s;t?" &s;aid Bell; "and pray why didn't you bring it &s;ooner?"</P>
<P>The girl was going to an&s;wer, but the maid interrupted her, &s;aying&mdash;"Come, come, none of your ex|cu&s;es; you are a little idle good for nothing thing, to di&s;appoint Mi&s;s Bell upon her birth-day.&mdash;But now you have brought it, let us look at
<PB N="25" REF="26">it." The little girl gave the lace without reply, and the maid de&s;ired her to go about her bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to expect to be paid; for that her mi&s;tre&s;s could not &s;ee any body, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> &s;he was in a room full of company.</P>
<P>"May I call again, madam, this afternoon?" &s;aid the child, timidly.</P>
<P>"Lord ble&s;s my &s;tars!" replied the maid, "what makes people &s;o poor, I <HI>wonders!</HI> I wi&s;h mi&s;tre&s;s would buy her lace at the warehou&s;e, as I told her, and not of the&s;e folks.&mdash;Call again! yes, to be &s;ure&mdash;I believe you'd call, call, call twenty times for two-pence.</P>
<P>However ungraciou&s;ly the per|mi&s;&s;ion to call again was granted, it was received with gratitude: the little girl departed with a chearful countenance: and Bell teized her
<PB N="26" REF="27">maid till &s;he got her to &s;ew the long wi&s;hed for lace upon her cuffs.</P>
<P>Unfortunate Bell!&mdash;All dinner|time pa&s;&s;ed, and people were &s;o hungry, &s;o bu&s;y, or &s;o &s;tupid, that not an eye ob&s;erved her favourite piece of finery. Till at length &s;he was no longer able to conceal her impatience, and turning to Laura, who &s;at next to her, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;"You have no lace upon your cuffs; look how beautiful mine is!&mdash;Is not it? Don't you wi&s;h your mamma could afford to give you &s;ome like it?&mdash;But you can't get any if &s;he would, for this was made on purpo&s;e for me on my birth-day, and nobody can get a bit more any where, if they would give the world for it."</P>
<P>"But cannot the per&s;on who made it," &s;aid Laura, "make any more like it?"</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
"No, no, no!" cried Bell; for &s;he had already learned, either from her maid or her mother, the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or u&s;eful, but for being &s;uch as nobody el&s;e can pro|cure.</P>
<P>"Nobody can get any like it, I &s;ay," repeated Bell; "Nobody in all London can make it but one per|&s;on, and that per&s;on will never make a bit for any body but me, I am &s;ure&mdash;mamma won't let her if I a&s;k her not."</P>
<P>"Very well," &s;aid Laura, coolly, "I do not want any of it; you need not be &s;o violent: I a&s;&s;ure you that I don't want any of it."</P>
<P>"Yes, but you do though," &s;aid Bell, more angrily.</P>
<P>"No, indeed," &s;aid Laura, &s;mil|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
"You do in the bottom of your heart; but you &s;ay you don't to plague me, I know," cried Bell, &s;welling with di&s;appointed vanity.&mdash; "It is pretty for all that, and it co&s;t a great deal of money too, and no|body &s;hall have any like it if they cried their eyes out."</P>
<P>Laura received this &s;entence in &s;ilence&mdash;Ro&s;amond &s;miled. And at her &s;mile the ill-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed rage of the &s;poiled child bur&s;t forth into the &s;eventh and loude&s;t fit of crying which had been heard upon her birth-day.</P>
<P>"What's the matter, my pet?" cried her mother; "Come to me, and tell me what's the matter."</P>
<P>Bell ran roaring to her mother; but no otherwi&s;e explained the cau&s;e of her &s;orrow than by tearing the fine lace, with frantic ge&s;tures, from
<PB N="29" REF="30">her cuffs, and throwing the fragments into her mother's lap.</P>
<P>"Oh! the lace, child!&mdash;are you mad?" &s;aid her mother, catching hold of both her hands. "Your beautiful lace, my dear love&mdash;do you know how much it co&s;t?"</P>
<P>"I don't care how much it co&s;t&mdash;it is not beautiful, and I'll have none of it," replied Bell, &s;obbing&mdash;"for it is not beautiful."</P>
<P>"But it is beautiful," retorted her mother; "I cho&s;e the pattern my&s;elf.&mdash;Who has put it into your head, child, to di&s;like it?&mdash;Was it Nancy?"</P>
<P>"No, not Nancy, but <HI>them,</HI> mam|ma," &s;aid Bell, pointing to Laura and Ro&s;amond.</P>
<P>"Oh fie! don't <HI>point,"</HI> &s;aid her mother, putting down her &s;tubborn finger; "nor &s;ay <HI>them,</HI> like Nancy;
<PB N="30" REF="31">I am &s;ure you mi&s;under&s;tood&mdash;Mi&s;s Laura, I am &s;ure, did not mean any &s;uch thing."</P>
<P>"No, madam; and I did not &s;ay any &s;uch thing that I recollect," &s;aid Laura, gently.</P>
<P>"Oh no, indeed!" cried Ro&s;a|mond, warmly ri&s;ing in her &s;i&s;ter's defence. But no defence or expla|nation was to be heard, for every body had now gathered round Bell to dry her tears, and to comfort her for the mi&s;chief &s;he had done to her own cuffs.</P>
<P>They &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady's eyes, and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour; and the bu&s;ine&s;s be|ing thus happily hu&s;hed up, the mo|ther, as a reward to her daughter for her good humour, begged that Ro|&s;amond
<PB N="31" REF="32">would now be &s;o good as to produce her "charming pre|&s;ent."</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond, followed by all the company, among&s;t whom to her great joy was her godmother, proceeded to the dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>"Now I am &s;ure," thought &s;he, "Bell will be &s;urpri&s;ed, and my godmother will &s;ee &s;he was right about my genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony, and the filigree ba&s;ket appeared in all its glory.</P>
<P>"Well, this is a charming pre|&s;ent indeed!" &s;aid the godmother, who was one of the company; "<HI>My</HI> Ro&s;amond knows how to make pre|&s;ents." And as &s;he &s;poke &s;he took hold of the ba&s;ket, to lift it down to the admiring audience. Scarcely had
<PB N="32" REF="33">&s;he touched it when lo! the myr|tle wreath, the medallions, all drop|ped&mdash;the ba&s;ket fell to the ground, and only the handle remained in her hand.</P>
<P>All eyes were fixed upon the wreck. Exclamations of &s;orrow were heard in various tones; and "Who can have done this?" was all that Ro&s;amond could &s;ay. Bell &s;tood in &s;ullen &s;ilence, which &s;he ob&s;tinately pre&s;erved in the mid&s;t of the enquiries which were made about the di&s;a&s;ter. At length the &s;ervants were &s;ummoned, and among&s;t them Nancy, Mi&s;s Bell's maid and gover|ne&s;s: &s;he affected much &s;urpri&s;e when &s;he &s;aw what had befallen the ba&s;ket, and declared that &s;he knew nothing of the matter, but that &s;he had &s;een her mi&s;tre&s;s in the morning put it quite &s;afe into the wardrobe;
<PB N="33" REF="34">and that, for her part, &s;he had never touched it, or thought of touching it, in her born days&mdash;"Nor Mi&s;s Bell neither, ma'am, I can an&s;wer for her; for &s;he never knew of its being there, becau&s;e I never &s;o much as mentioned it to her, that there was &s;uch a thing in the hou&s;e, becau&s;e I knew Mi&s;s Ro&s;amond wanted to &s;ur|pri&s;e her with the &s;ecret&mdash;&s;o I never mentioned a &s;entence of it&mdash;Did I, Mi&s;s Bell?"</P>
<P>Bell, putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her, an|&s;wered boldly, <HI>No;</HI> but &s;he had hold of Ro&s;amond's hand, and at the in|&s;tant &s;he uttered this fal&s;ehood &s;he &s;queezed it terribly.</P>
<P>"Why do you &s;queeze my hand &s;o?" &s;aid Ro&s;amond, in a low voice; "What are you afraid of?"</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
"Afraid of!" cried Bell, turning angrily; "I'm not afraid of any thing&mdash;I've nothing to be afraid about."</P>
<P>"Nay, I did not &s;ay you had," whi&s;pered Ro&s;amond; "But only if you did by accident&mdash;You know what I mean&mdash;I &s;hould not be angry if you did&mdash;Only &s;ay &s;o."</P>
<P>"I &s;ay I did not!" cried Bell, furiou&s;ly; "Mamma!&mdash;Mamma!&mdash;Nancy! my cou&s;in Ro&s;amond won't believe me! that's very hard&mdash;It's very rude! and I won't bear it&mdash;I won't."</P>
<P>"Don't be angry, love&mdash;don't;" &s;aid the maid.</P>
<P>"Nobody &s;u&s;pects you, darling;" &s;aid her mother.&mdash;"But &s;he has too much &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;Don't cry, love, nobody &s;u&s;pected you."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
"But you know," continued &s;he, turning to the maid, "&s;omebody mu&s;t have done this, and I mu&s;t know how it was done; Mi&s;s Ro&s;a|mond's charming pre&s;ent mu&s;t not be &s;poiled in this way, in my hou&s;e, without my taking proper notice of it.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ure you I am very angry about it, Ro&s;amond."</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond did not rejoice in her anger, and had nearly made a &s;ad mi&s;take, by &s;peaking loud her thoughts&mdash;<HI>"I was very fooli&s;h</HI>&mdash;" &s;he began and &s;topped.</P>
<P>"Ma'am," cried the maid, &s;ud|denly, "I'll venture to &s;ay I know who did it."</P>
<P>"Who?" &s;aid every one eager|ly.</P>
<P>"Who?" &s;aid Bell, trembling.</P>
<P>"Why, Mi&s;s, don't you recollect that little girl with the lace, that we
<PB N="36" REF="37">&s;aw peeping about in the pa&s;&s;age: I'm &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t have done it, for here &s;he was by her&s;elf half an hour or more, and not another creature has been in mi&s;tre&s;s's dre&s;&s;ing-room, to my certain knowledge, &s;ince morn|ing. Tho&s;e &s;ort of people have &s;o much curio&s;ity, I'm &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t have been meddling with it;" added the maid.</P>
<P>"Oh yes, that's the thing," &s;aid the mi&s;tre&s;s, decidedly.&mdash;"Well, Mi&s;s Ro&s;amond, for your comfort, &s;he &s;hall never come into my hou&s;e again."</P>
<P>"Oh, that would not comfort me at all," &s;aid Ro&s;amond; "be&s;ides, we are not &s;ure that &s;he did it; and if&mdash;" A &s;ingle knock at the door was heard at this in&s;tant: it was the little girl, who came to be paid for her lace.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
"Call her in," &s;aid the lady of the hou&s;e; "let us &s;ee her di|rectly."</P>
<P>The maid, who was afraid that the girl's innocence would appear if &s;he were produced, he&s;itated; but upon her mi&s;tre&s;s's repeating her com|mands, &s;he was forced to obey.</P>
<P>The child came in with a look of &s;implicity; but when &s;he &s;aw the room full of company &s;he was a little aba&s;hed. Ro&s;amond and Laura look|ed at her, and at one another with &s;urpri&s;e; for it was the &s;ame little girl whom they had &s;een weaving lace.</P>
<P>"Is not it &s;he?" whi&s;pered Ro&s;a mond to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Yes it is; but hu&s;h," &s;aid Lau|ra, "&s;he does not know us.&mdash;Don't &s;ay a word, let us hear what &s;he will &s;ay." Laura got behind the re&s;t of
<PB N="38" REF="39">the company as &s;he &s;poke, &s;o that the little girl could not &s;ee her.</P>
<P>"Va&s;tly well!" &s;aid Bell's mo|ther; "I am waiting to &s;ee how long you will have the a&s;&s;urance to &s;tand there with that innocent look. Did you ever &s;ee that ba&s;ket be|fore?"</P>
<P>"Yes; ma'am;" &s;aid the girl.</P>
<P><HI>"Yes, ma'am,"</HI> cried the maid, "and what el&s;e do you know about it?&mdash;You had better confe&s;s it at once, and Mi&s;tre&s;s perhaps will &s;ay no more about it."</P>
<P>"Yes, do confe&s;s it;" added Bell, earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>"Confe&s;s what, madam?" &s;aid the little girl; "I never touched the ba&s;ket, madam."</P>
<P>"You never <HI>touched</HI> it; but you confe&s;s," interrupted Bell's mother, that you <HI>did &s;ee</HI> it before&mdash;And pray
<PB N="39" REF="40">how came you to &s;ee it? you mu&s;t have opened my wardrobe."</P>
<P>"No, indeed, madam," &s;aid the little girl; "but I was waiting in the pa&s;&s;age, ma'am, and this door was partly open; and looking at the maid, you know, I could not help &s;eeing it."</P>
<P>"Why, how could you &s;ee it through the doors of my wardrobe?" rejoined the lady.</P>
<P>The maid, frightened, pulled the little girl by the &s;leeve.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer me," &s;aid the lady, "where did you &s;ee this ba&s;ket?"</P>
<P>Another &s;tronger pull.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw it, madam, in her hands," looking at the maid; "and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, and what became of it afterwards?"</P>
<P>"Ma'am," he&s;itating, "Mi&s;s pulled, and by accident&mdash;I believe, I
<PB N="40" REF="41">&s;aw, ma'am&mdash;Mi&s;s, you know what I &s;aw."</P>
<P>"I do not know&mdash;I do not know: and if I did&mdash;you had no bu&s;ine&s;s there&mdash;and mamma won't believe you, I am &s;ure."</P>
<P>But every body el&s;e did, and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>"What do you all look at me &s;o for?&mdash;Why do you all look &s;o? &mdash;And am I to be &s;hamed upon my birth-day?" cried &s;he, bur&s;ting into a roar of pa&s;&s;ion; "And all for this na&s;ty thing!" added &s;he, pu&s;hing away the remains of the ba&s;ket, and looking angrily at Ro&s;amond.</P>
<P>"Bell; Bell! Oh fie! fie! now I <HI>am</HI> a&s;hamed of you&mdash;that's quite rude to your cou&s;in," &s;aid her mo|ther, who was more &s;hocked at her daughter's want of politene&s;s than at
<PB N="41" REF="42">her fal&s;ehood. -"Take her away, Nancy, till &s;he has done crying;" added &s;he to the maid, who accord|ingly carried off her pupil.</P>
<P>Ro&s;amond, during this &s;cene, e&s;|pecially at the moment when her pre&s;ent was pu&s;hed away with &s;uch di&s;dain, had been making reflections upon the nature of true genero&s;ity. A &s;mile from her father, who &s;tood by, a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the cata&s;|trophe of the filigree ba&s;ket, gave ri&s;e to the&s;e reflections; nor were they entirely di&s;&s;ipated by the con|dolence of the re&s;t of the company, nor even by the prai&s;es of her god|mother, who to con&s;ole her &s;aid&mdash;'Well, my dear Ro&s;amond, I ad|mire your generous &s;pirit. You know I prophecied that your half-guinea would be gone the &s;oone&s;t&mdash;Did I not, Laura?" &s;aid &s;he, ap|pealing
<PB N="42" REF="43">in a &s;arca&s;tic tone to where &s;he thought Laura was.&mdash;"Where is Laura? I don't &s;ee her."</P>
<P>Laura came forward.</P>
<P>"You are too <HI>prudent</HI> to throw away your money like your &s;i&s;ter; your half-guinea, I'll an&s;wer for it, is &s;nug in your pocket&mdash;Is it not?"</P>
<P>"No, madam;" an&s;wered &s;he, in a low voice. But low as the voice was, the poor little lace-girl heard it; and now for the fir&s;t time, fixing her eyes upon Laura, recollected her be|nefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Oh, that's the young lady!" &s;he exclaimed, in a tone of joyful gratitude&mdash;"The good!&mdash;good young lady, who gave me the half-guinea, and would not &s;tay to be thanked for it&mdash;but I <HI>will</HI> thank her now."</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
"The half-guinea, Laura!" &s;aid her godmother&mdash;"What is all this?"</P>
<P>"I'll tell you, madam, if you plea&s;e;" &s;aid the little girl.</P>
<P>It was not in expectation of being prai&s;ed for it, that Laura had been generous, and therefore every body was really touched with the hi&s;tory of the weaving-pillow; and whil&s;t they prai&s;ed, felt a certain degree of re&s;pect, which is not always felt by tho&s;e who pour forth eulogiums. <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> is not an improper word, even applied to a child of Laura's age; for let the age or &s;ituation of the per&s;on be what it may, they command re&s;pect who de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>"Ah, madam!" &s;aid Ro&s;amond to her godmother, "now you &s;ee&mdash;you &s;ee &s;he is <HI>not</HI> a little mi&s;er: I'm &s;ure that's better than wa&s;ting half a
<PB N="44" REF="45">guinea upon a filigree ba&s;ket&mdash;Is it not, ma'am?" &s;aid &s;he, with an eagerne&s;s which &s;hewed that &s;he had forgotten all her own misfortunes in &s;ympathy with her &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;"This is being <HI>really generous,</HI> father, is it not?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Ro&s;amond," &s;aid her fa|ther, and he ki&s;&s;ed her&mdash;"this <HI>is</HI> being really generous. It is not only by giving away money that we can &s;hew genero&s;ity, it is by giving up to others any thing that we like our&s;elves: and therefore," added he, &s;miling, "it is really generous of you to give your &s;i&s;ter the thing you like be&s;t of all others."</P>
<P>"The thing I like the be&s;t of all others, father," &s;aid Ro&s;amond, half plea&s;ed, half vexed; "What is that I wonder?&mdash;You don't mean <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> do you, &s;ir?"</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
"Nay, you mu&s;t decide that, Ro&s;amond."</P>
<P>"Why, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, ingenu|ou&s;ly, "perhaps it <HI>was</HI> ONCE the thing I liked be&s;t; but the plea&s;ure I have ju&s;t felt, makes me like &s;ome|thing el&s;e better."</P>

<HEAD>THE MIMIC.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and MRS. MONTAGUE &s;pent the &s;ummer of the year 1795 at Clif|ton, with their &s;on Frederick, and their two daughters, Sophia and Marianne&mdash;They had taken much care of the education of their chil|dren, nor were they ever tempted by any motive of per&s;onal convenience, or temporary amu&s;ement, to hazard the permanent happine&s;s of their pupils.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the extreme importance of early impre&s;&s;ions, and of the power|ful
<PB N="82" REF="81">influence of external circum&s;tances in forming the character, and the manners, they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas, and new objects, which would &s;trike the minds of their children, &s;hould ap|pear in a ju&s;t point of view.</P>
<P>"Let children &s;ee, and judge for them&s;elves," is often incon&s;iderately &s;aid.&mdash;Where children &s;ee only a "part," they cannot judge of the "whole"&mdash;and from the &s;uperficial view which they can have in &s;hort vi&s;its, and de&s;ultory conver&s;ation, they can form only a fal&s;e e&s;timate of the objects of human happine&s;s, a fal&s;e notion of the nature of &s;ociety, and fal&s;e opinions of characters.&mdash;For the&s;e rea&s;ons Mr. and Mrs. Montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintance, as they were well aware, that whatever pa&s;&s;ed in con|ver&s;ation
<PB N="83" REF="82">before their children, be|came part of their education.&mdash;When they came to Clifton, they wi&s;hed to have had a hou&s;e entirely to them|&s;elves, but as they came late in the &s;ea&s;on, almo&s;t all the lodging hou&s;es were full, and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a hou&s;e in which &s;ome of the apart|ments were already occupied.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t fortnight, they &s;carcely &s;aw or heard any thing of one of the families, who lodged on the &s;ame floor with them.&mdash;An elderly Quaker, and his &s;i&s;ter Birtha, were their &s;ilent neighbours.&mdash;The bloom|ing complexion of the lady, had indeed attracted the attention of the children, as they caught a glimp&s;e of her face when &s;he was getting into her carriage to go out upon the Downs.&mdash;They could
<PB N="84" REF="83">&s;carcely believe that &s;he came to the Wells on account of her health.&mdash;Be&s;ides her blooming complexion, the delicate white of her garments had &s;truck them with admiration, and they ob&s;erved that her brother carefully guarded the&s;e from the wheel of the carriage as he handed her in.&mdash;From this circum&s;tance, and from the be|nevolent countenance of the old gen|tleman, they concluded, that he was very fond of his &s;i&s;ter&mdash;that they were certainly very happy, only they never &s;poke, and could be &s;een but for a moment.</P>
<P>Not &s;o the maiden lady who occu|pied the ground floor.&mdash;On the &s;tairs, in the pa&s;&s;ages, at her window, &s;he was continually vi&s;ible, and &s;he &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the art of being pre&s;ent in all the&s;e places at once.&mdash;Her voice was eternally to be heard, and it was
<PB N="85" REF="84">not particularly melodious. The very fir&s;t day &s;he met Mrs. Montague's children on the &s;tairs, &s;he &s;topped to tell Marianne, that &s;he was a charm|ing dear! and a charming little dear! to ki&s;s her, to enquire her name, and to inform her that her own name was "Mrs. There&s;a Tattle;" a circum|&s;tance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance, for in the cour&s;e of one morning at lea&s;t twenty &s;ingle, and as many double raps at the door, were &s;uc|ceeded by vociferations of "Mrs. There&s;a's Tattle's &s;ervant!"&mdash;"Mrs. There&s;a Tattle at home?"&mdash;"Mrs. There&s;a Tattle not at home."</P>
<P>No per&s;on at the Wells was often|er at home and abroad than Mrs. Tattle; &s;he had, as &s;he deemed it, the happine&s;s to have a mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive acquaintance re&s;iding at Clif|ton&mdash;&s;he
<PB N="86" REF="85">had for years kept a regi&s;ter of arrivals. She regularly con&s;ulted the &s;ub&s;criptions to the circulating libraries, and the li&s;ts at the Ball and the Pump-Rooms; &s;o, that with a memory unincumbered with litera|ture, and free from all dome&s;tic cares, &s;he contrived to retain a mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing and correct li&s;t of births, deaths, and marriages, together with all the anecdotes, amu&s;ing, in&s;tructive, or &s;candalous, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the conver&s;ation of a water-drinking place, and e&s;&s;ential to the character of a "very plea|&s;ant woman."</P>
<P>"A very plea&s;ant woman," Mrs. Tattle was u&s;ually called, and con|&s;cious of her accompli&s;hments, &s;he was eager to introduce her&s;elf to the acquaintance of her new neighbours; having, with her ordinary expedition,
<PB N="87" REF="86">collected from their &s;ervants, by means of her own, all that could be known, or rather all that could be told, about them. The name of Montague, at all events, &s;he knew was a good name, and ju&s;tified her courting this acquaintance. She courted it fir&s;t by nods, and becks, and &s;miles, at Marianne, whenever &s;he met her; and Marianne, who was a very little girl, began pre|&s;ently to nod and &s;mile in return; per&s;uaded, that a lady who &s;miled &s;o much, could not be ill-natured. Be&s;ides, Mrs. There&s;a's parlour door was &s;ometimes left more than half open, to afford a view of a green parrot. Marianne &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed very &s;lowly by this door. One morning it was left quite wide open, &s;he &s;topped to &s;ay "Pretty Poll," and immediately Mrs. Tattle begged
<PB N="88" REF="87">&s;he would do her the honour to walk in and &s;ee "Pretty Poll;" at the &s;ame time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plumb cake.</P>
<P>The next day Mrs. There&s;a Tattle did her&s;elf the honour to wait upon Mrs. Montague, "to apologi&s;e for the liberty &s;he had taken, in inviting Mrs. Montague's charming Mi&s;s Marianne into her apartment to &s;ee "Pretty Poll;" and for the &s;till greater liberty &s;he had taken in offering her a piece of plumb cake, incon&s;iderate creature that &s;he was! which might po&s;&s;ibly have di&s;agreed with her, and which certainly were liberties &s;he never &s;hould have been induced to take, if &s;he had not been unaccountably bewitched by Mi&s;s Marianne's &s;triking, though highly flattering re&s;emblance, to a young gentleman, an officer, with whom
<PB N="89" REF="88">&s;he had danced; &s;he was &s;orry to &s;ay, now nearly twelve years ago, at the races in&mdash;&s;hire, of the name of Montague, a mo&s;t re&s;pectable young man, and of a mo&s;t re&s;pectable fa|mily, with which, in a remote de|gree, &s;he might pre&s;ume to &s;ay, &s;he her&s;elf was &s;omeway connected, having the honour to be nearly related to the Jones's of Merioneth|&s;hire, who were cou&s;ins to the Manwairings, of Bedford&s;hire, who married into the family of the Griffiths's, the elde&s;t branch of which &s;he under&s;tood had the honour to be cou&s;in german to Mr. Montague, on which account &s;he had been im|patient to pay a vi&s;it &s;o likely to be productive of mo&s;t agreeable con&s;e|quences, in the acqui&s;ition of an ac|quaintance, who&s;e &s;ociety mu&s;t do her infinite honour."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="89">
Having thus happily accompli&s;hed her fir&s;t vi&s;it, there &s;eemed little pro|bability of e&s;caping Mrs. Tattle's far|ther acquaintance. In the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t week, &s;he only hinted to Mr. Montague, that "&s;ome people thought his &s;y&s;tem of education ra|ther odd, that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to him if he would, &s;ome time or other, when he had nothing el&s;e to do, ju&s;t &s;it down and make her under&s;tand his notions, that &s;he might have &s;omething to &s;ay to her acquaintance, as &s;he always wi&s;hed to have when &s;he heard any friend attacked, or any friend's opi|nions."</P>
<P>Mr. Montague declining to &s;it down and make this lady under&s;tand a &s;y&s;tem of education only to give her &s;omething to &s;ay, and &s;hewing unaccountable indifference about the
<PB N="91" REF="90">attacks with which he was threatened, Mrs. Tattle next ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Mrs. Montague, prophecying, in a mo&s;t &s;erious whi&s;|per, "that the charming Mi&s;s Ma|rianne would &s;hortly and inevitably grow quite crooked, if &s;he were not immediately provided with a back|board, a French dancing-ma&s;ter, and a pair of &s;tocks." This alarming whi&s;per could not, however, have a permanent effect upon Mrs. Monta|gue's under&s;tanding, becau&s;e, three days afterwards, Mrs. There&s;a, up|on the mo&s;t anxious in&s;pection, mi&s;took the hip and &s;houlder which &s;hould have been the highe&s;t. This danger vani&s;hing, Mrs. Tattle pre|&s;ently, with a rueful length of face, and formal preface, "he&s;itated to a&s;&s;ure Mrs. Montague, that &s;he was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed about her daughter
<PB N="92" REF="91">Sophy; that &s;he was convinced her lungs were affected; and that &s;he certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening; and above all things, mu&s;t keep one of the Pa|tiro&s;&s;a lozenges con&s;tantly in her mouth, and directly con&s;ult Dr. Cardimum, the be&s;t phy&s;ician in the world, and the per&s;on &s;he would &s;end for her&s;elf upon her death bed; becau&s;e, to her certain knowledge, he had recovered a young lady, a relation of her own, after &s;he had lo&s;t one whole globe of her lungs."</P>
<P>The medical opinion of a lady of &s;o much anatomical preci&s;ion, could not have much weight; nor was this univer&s;al advi&s;er more &s;ucce&s;sful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick, who, "&s;he apprehended, mu&s;t want one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek, and dead lan|guages,
<PB N="93" REF="92">of which &s;he ob&s;erved it would be impertinent for a woman to talk, only &s;he might venture to repeat what &s;he had heard &s;aid by good authority, that a competency of the dead tongues could be had no where but at a public &s;chool, or el&s;e from a private tutor, who had been abroad (after the advan|tages of a cla&s;&s;ical education, fini&s;hed in one of the Univer&s;ities) with a good family, without which intro|duction, it was idle to think of reaping &s;olid advantages from any continental tour; all which requi&s;ites &s;he could, from per&s;onal knowledge, aver concentrated in the gentleman &s;he had the honour to recom|mend, as having been tutor to a young nobleman, who had now no farther occa&s;ion for him, being,
<PB N="94" REF="93">unfortunately, for him&s;elf and his family, killed in an untimely duel.</P>
<P>All her &s;ugge&s;tions being lo&s;t upon the&s;e unthinking parents, Mrs. There|&s;a Tattle's powers were next tried upon the children, and pre&s;ently her &s;ucce&s;s was apparent. On Sophy, in|deed, &s;he could not make any impre&s;|&s;ion, though &s;he had expended on her &s;ome of her fine&s;t &s;trokes of flattery-Sophy, though very de&s;irous of the approbation of her friends, was not very &s;olicitous to win the favour of &s;trangers. She was about thirteen, that dangerous age at which ill edu|cated girls, in their anxiety to di&s;|play their accompli&s;hments, are apt to become dependent for applau&s;e upon the prai&s;e of every idle vi&s;itor; when the habits not being formed, and the aftention being &s;uddenly turned to dre&s;s and manners, girls are
<PB N="95" REF="94">apt to affect and imitate, indi&s;crimi|nately, every thing that they fancy to be agreeable.</P>
<P>Sophy, who&s;e ta&s;te had been cul|tivated at the &s;ame time with her powers of rea&s;oning, was not liable to fall into the&s;e errors; &s;he found that &s;he could plea&s;e tho&s;e whom &s;he wi&s;hed to plea&s;e, without affect|ing to be any thing but what &s;he really was; and her friends li&s;tened to what &s;he &s;aid, though &s;he never repeated the &s;entiments, or adopted the phra&s;es, which &s;he might ea&s;ily have caught from the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who were older, or more fa&s;hionable than her&s;elf. This word fa&s;hionable, Mrs. There&s;a Tattle knew had u&s;ually a great effect even at thirteen, but &s;he had not ob&s;erved that it had much power upon Sophy; nor were her documents concerning grace and
<PB N="96" REF="95">manners, much attended to. Her mother had taught Sophy, that it was be&s;t to let her&s;elf alone, and not to di&s;tort either her per&s;on or her mind, in acquiring grimace, which nothing but the fa&s;hion of the mo|ment can &s;upport, and which is al|ways detected and de&s;pi&s;ed by peo|ple of real good &s;en&s;e and polite|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me!" &s;aid Mrs. Tattle to her&s;elf, "if I had &s;uch a tall daughter, and &s;o unformed, before my eyes from morning to night, it would certainly break my poor heart. Thank God I am not a mother! Mi&s;s Marianne for me, if I was!"</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Marianne had heard &s;o often from Mrs. Tattle that &s;he was charm|ing, that &s;he could not help believing it; and from being a very plea&s;ing, unaffected little girl, &s;he in a &s;hort
<PB N="97" REF="96">time grew &s;o conceited, that &s;he could neither &s;peak, look, move, or be &s;ilent, without imagining that every body was, or ought to be, looking at her; and when Mrs. There&s;a &s;aw that Mrs. Montague looked very grave upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;he, to repair the ill &s;he had done, would &s;ay, after prai&s;ing Marianne's hair or her eyes, "Oh, but little ladies &s;hould never think about their beauty you know; nobody loves any body you know for being hand&s;ome, but for being good." People mu&s;t think children are very &s;illy, or el&s;e they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds, if they imagine that children will be|lieve the words that are &s;aid to them by way of moral, when the counte|nance, manner, and every conco|mitant circum&s;tance tell them a dif|ferent
<PB N="98" REF="97">tale. Children are excellent phy&s;iognomi&s;ts, they quickly learn the univer&s;al language of looks, and what is &s;aid of them always makes a greater impre&s;&s;ion than what is &s;aid to them; a truth of which tho&s;e prudent people &s;urely cannot be aware, who comfort them&s;elves and apologize to parents by &s;aying, "O but I would not &s;ay &s;o and &s;o to the child."</P>
<P>Mrs. There&s;a had &s;eldom &s;aid to Frederick Montague, "that he had a va&s;t deal of drollery, and was a mo&s;t incomparable Mimic;" but &s;he had &s;aid &s;o of him in whi&s;pers, which magnified the &s;ound to his imagina|tion, if not to his ear. He was a boy of much vivacity, and had con&s;iderable abilities; but his ap|petite for vulgar prai&s;e had not yet been &s;urfeited; even Mrs. There&s;a
<PB N="99" REF="98">Tattle's flattery plea&s;ed him, and he exerted him&s;elf for her entertain|ment &s;o much, that he became quite a buffoon. In&s;tead of ob&s;erving characters and manners, that he might judge of them and form his own, he now watched every per&s;on he &s;aw, that he might de|tect &s;ome foible, or catch &s;ome &s;ingu|larity in their ge&s;ture or pronuncia|tion, which he might &s;ucce&s;sfully mimic.</P>
<P>Alarmed by the rapid progre&s;s of the&s;e evils, Mr. and Mrs. Montague, who, from the fir&s;t day that they had been honoured with Mrs. Tattle's vi&s;it, had begun to look out for new lodgings, were now extremely impa|tient to decamp. They were not people who, from the weak fear of offending a &s;illy acquaintance, would hazard the happine&s;s of their family.
<PB N="100" REF="99">They had heard of a hou&s;e in the country which was likely to &s;uit them, and they determined to go directly to look at it. As they were to be ab&s;ent all day, they fore&s;aw their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children. They did not choo&s;e to exact any promi&s;e from them which they might be tempted to break, and therefore they only &s;aid at parting, "If Mrs. There&s;a Tattle &s;hould a&s;k you to come to her, do as you think proper."</P>
<P>Scarcely had Mrs. Montague's car|riage gone out of hearing, when a note was brought directed to "Fre|derick Montague, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> junior," which he immediately opened, and read as follows:</P>
<P>"Mrs. There&s;a Tattle pre&s;ents her very be&s;t compliments to the enter|taining Mr. Frederick Montague; &s;he
<PB N="101" REF="100">hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening, and bring his charming &s;i&s;ter Marianne with him, as Mrs. There&s;a will be quite alone, with a &s;hocking head|ach, and is &s;en&s;ible her nerves are affected; and Dr. Cardimum &s;ays, that (e&s;pecially in Mrs. T. T's. ca&s;e) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an in&s;tant; &s;he therefore tru&s;ts Mr. Frederick will not refu&s;e to come and make her laugh.</P>
<P>"Mrs. There&s;a has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite, who &s;aid &s;he was particu|larly fond of them the other day.</P>
<P>"Mrs. There&s;a hopes they will all come at &s;ix, or before; not forget|ting Mi&s;s Sophy, if &s;he will con|de&s;cend to be of the party."</P>

At the fir&s;t reading of this note, "the entertaining" Mr. Frederick, and the charming Mi&s;s Marianne, laughed heartily, and looked at Sophy as if they were afraid that &s;he &s;hould think it po&s;&s;ible they could like &s;uch gro&s;s flattery; but upon a &s;econd peru&s;al Marianne ob&s;erved, that it certainly was good-natured of Mrs. There&s;a to remember the macaroons; and Frederick allowed, that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman becau&s;e &s;he had the head-ach. Then twi&s;ting the note in his fingers, he appealed to Sophy: "Well, Sophy, leave off drawing for an in&s;tant, and tell us what an|&s;wer can we &s;end?" "Can! we can &s;end what an&s;wer we plea&s;e." "Yes, I know that," &s;aid Frederick; "I would refu&s;e if I could, but we ought
<PB N="103" REF="102">not to do any thing rude, &s;hould we? &s;o I think we might as well go." "Hey! becau&s;e we could not re|fu&s;e if we would, I &s;ay."</P>
<P>"You have made &s;uch confu&s;ion, replied Sophy, between "could n't," and "would n't," and "&s;hould n't," that I can't under&s;tand you; &s;urely they are all different things."</P>
<P>"Different! no," cried Frederick, "could, would, &s;hould, might, or ought," are all the &s;ame thing in the Latin grammar; all of 'em &s;igns of the potential mood, you know."</P>
<P>Sophy, who&s;e powers of rea&s;oning were not to be confounded even by quotations from the Latin grammar, looked up &s;oberly from her drawing, and an&s;wered, "That very likely tho&s;e words might be &s;igns of the &s;ame thing in the Latin grammar,
<PB N="104" REF="103">but that &s;he believed they meant per|fectly different things in real life."</P>
<P>"That's ju&s;t as people plea&s;e," &s;aid her &s;ophi&s;tical brother, "you know words mean nothing in them|&s;elves. If I cho&s;e to call my hat my cadwallader, you would under|&s;tand me ju&s;t as well, after I had once explained it to you, that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put upon my head; cadwal|lader and that would then be ju&s;t the &s;ame thing to you."</P>
<P>"Then why have two words for the &s;ame thing?" &s;aid Sophy; "and what has this to do with could and &s;hould? You wanted to prove"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I wanted to prove," interrupted Frederick, "that it's not worth while to di&s;pute for two hours about two
<PB N="105" REF="104">words. Do keep to the point, Sophy, and don't di&s;pute with me."</P>
<P>"I was not di&s;puting, I was rea|&s;oning."</P>
<P>"Well, rea&s;oning or di&s;puting. Women have no bu&s;ine&s;s to do either, for how &s;hould they know how to chop logic like men."</P>
<P>At this contemptuous &s;arca&s;m up|on her &s;ex, Sophy's colour ro&s;e. "There!" cried Frederick, exulting, "Now we &s;hall &s;ee a philo&s;ophere&s;s in a pa&s;&s;ion. I'd give &s;ixpence, half price for a harlequin entertainment, to &s;ee Sophy in a pa&s;&s;ion. Now Marianne, look at her bru&s;h dab|bling &s;o fa&s;t in the water!"</P>
<P>Sophy, who could not ea&s;ily bear to be laughed at, with &s;ome little in|dignation, &s;aid, "Brother, I wi&s;h," &mdash;"There! There!" cried Frede|rick,
<PB N="106" REF="105">pointing to the colour which ro&s;e in her cheek almo&s;t to her temples; "Ri&s;ing! Ri&s;ing! Ri&s;ing! Look at the thermometer. Blood heat! Blood! Fever heat! Boiling water heat! Marianne."</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Sophy, &s;miling, "you &s;hould &s;tand a little farther off, both of you; leave the thermometer to it&s;elf for a little while; give it time to cool. It will come down to tem|perate by the time you look again."</P>
<P>"Oh, brother," cried Marianne, "&s;he's &s;o good humour'd, don't teize her any more; and don't draw heads upon her paper; and don't &s;tretch her rubber out; and don't let us dirty any more of her bru&s;hes: See! the &s;ides of her tumbler are all manner of colours."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106">
"Oh, I only mixed red, blue, green, and yellow, to &s;hew you, Marianne, that all colours mixed together make white. But &s;he is temperate now, and I won't plague her; &s;he &s;hall chop logic if &s;he likes it, though &s;he is a woman."</P>
<P>"But that's not fair, brother," &s;aid Marianne, to &s;ay woman in that way. I'm &s;ure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa &s;hewed to us ye&s;terday, long before you did, though you are a man." "Not long," &s;aid Frederick; "be&s;ides, that was only a conjuring trick."</P>
<P>"It was very ingenious, though," &s;aid Marianne, "and papa &s;aid &s;o; and be&s;ides, &s;he under&s;tood the rule of three, which was no conjuring trick, better than you did, though,
<PB N="108" REF="107">&s;he is a woman; and &s;he may rea&s;on too, mamma &s;ays."</P>
<P>"Very well, let her rea&s;on away," &s;aid the provoking wit; "all I have to &s;ay is, &s;he'll never be able to make a pudding." "Why not, pray bro|ther," enquired Sophy, looking up again very gravely. "Why, you know papa him&s;elf the other day at dinner, &s;aid, that that woman who talks Greek and Latin as well as I do, is a fool after all; and that &s;he had better have learned &s;ome|thing u&s;eful; and Mrs. Tattle &s;aid &s;he'd an&s;wer for it &s;he did not know, how to make a pudding."</P>
<P>"Well, but I am not talking Greek and Latin, am I?"</P>
<P>"No; but you are drawing, and that's the &s;ame thing."</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108">
"The &s;ame thing! O Frederick," &s;aid little Marianne, laughing.</P>
<P>"You may laugh, but I &s;ay it is the &s;ame &s;ort of thing. Women that are always drawing, and rea|&s;oning, never know how to make puddings; Mrs. There&s;a Tattle &s;aid &s;o when I &s;hewed her Sophy's beau|tiful drawing ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>"Mrs. There&s;a Tattle might &s;ay &s;o," replied Sophy, calmly, "but I do not perceive the rea&s;on, brother, why drawing &s;hould prevent me from learning how to make a pud|ding."</P>
<P>"Well, I &s;ay you'll never learn to make a good pudding."</P>
<P>"I have learned," continued Sophy, who was mixing her colours, "to mix &s;uch and &s;uch colours together to make the colour that I want, and why
<PB N="110" REF="109">&s;hould I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter, and &s;ugar and egg together, to make the ta&s;te that I want?"</P>
<P>"Oh, but mixing will never do, unle&s;s you know the quantities, like a cook; and you would never learn the right quantities."</P>
<P>"How did the cook learn them, cannot I learn them as &s;he did?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but you'd never do it exactly, and mind the &s;poonfuls rightly, by the receipt, like a cook, exactly."</P>
<P>"Indeed! indeed but &s;he would," cried Marianne eagerly, "and a great deal more exactly, for Mamma has taught her to weigh and mea&s;ure things very carefully; and when I was ill, &s;he always weighed my bark &s;o nicely, and dropped my drops
<PB N="111" REF="110">&s;o carefully; not like the cook. When Mamma took me down to &s;ee her make a cake once, I &s;aw her &s;poonfuls, and her ounces, and her handfuls; &s;he da&s;hed and &s;pla&s;hed without minding exactne&s;s, or the receipt, or any thing. I'm &s;ure Sophy would make a much better pudding, if exactne&s;s only is want|ing."</P>
<P>"Well, granting that &s;he could make the be&s;t pudding in the whole world, what does that &s;ignify? I &s;ay &s;he never would, &s;o it comes to the &s;ame thing."</P>
<P>"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?"</P>
<P>"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?"</P>
<P>"Why now look at her, with her books, and her drawings, and all this apparatus; do you think &s;he would ever jump up,
<PB N="112" REF="111">with all her nicety too, and put bye all the&s;e things, to go down into the grea&s;y kitchen, and plump up to the elbows in &s;uet, like a cook, for a plumb pudding?"</P>
<P>"I need not plump up to the elbows, brother," &s;aid Sophy, &s;mil|ing, "nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould be a cook; but if it were nece&s;&s;ary, I hope I &s;hould be able to make a pudding."</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, yes," cried Marianne, warmly, "that &s;he would, jump up and put by all her things in a minute, if it was nece&s;&s;ary, and run down &s;tairs and up again like lightning, or do any thing that was ever &s;o di&s;agree|able to her, even about the &s;uet, with all the nicety, brother, I a&s;&s;ure you, as &s;he u&s;ed to do any thing; every thing for me when I was ill la&s;t Win|ter.
<PB N="113" REF="112">Oh, brother, &s;he can do any thing! and &s;he could make the be&s;t plumb pudding in the whole world, I'm &s;ure, in a minute, if it was nece&s;&s;ary."</P>

<P>A KNOCK at the door from Mrs. There&s;a Tattle's &s;ervant, recalled Marianne to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>"There," &s;aid Frederick, "we have &s;ent no an&s;wer all this time. It's nece&s;&s;ary to think of that in a minute."</P>
<P>The &s;ervant came with his mi&s;tre&s;s's compliments, to let the young ladies and Mr. Frederick know that &s;he was waiting tea for them.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="114">
"Waiting! then we mu&s;t go," &s;aid Frederick.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant opened the door wider to let him pa&s;s, and Marianne thought &s;he mu&s;t follow her brother, &s;o they went down &s;tairs together, whil&s;t So|phy gave her own me&s;&s;age to the &s;er|vant, and quietly &s;taid at her u&s;ual occupations.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tattle was &s;eated at her tea|table, with a large plate of macaroons be&s;ide her, when Frederick and Marianne entered. She was "de|lighted" they were come, and "grieved" not to &s;ee Mi&s;s Sophy along with them. Marianne co|loured a little, for though &s;he had precipitately followed her brother, and though he had quieted her con|&s;cience for a moment, by &s;aying, "You know Papa and Mamma told us to do what we thought be&s;t;"
<PB N="117" REF="115">yet &s;he did not feel quite plea&s;ed with her&s;elf; and it was not till after Mrs. There&s;a had exhau&s;ted all her compliments, and half her maca|roons, that &s;he could re&s;tore her &s;pirits to their u&s;ual height.</P>
<P>"Come, Mr. Frederick," &s;aid &s;he, after tea, "you promi&s;ed to make me laugh; and nobody can make me laugh &s;o well as your&s;elf."</P>

<P>"Now brother, &s;uppo&s;e that it is after dinner," &s;aid Marianne, "and &s;hew us how the doctor goes to &s;leep."</P>
<P>Frederick threw him&s;elf back in an arm chair, leaning his head back, with his mouth open, &s;noring; nodded from time to time; cro&s;&s;ed and un|cro&s;&s;ed his legs; tried to waken him&s;elf by twitching his wig, &s;et|tling
<PB N="122" REF="120">his collar, blowing his no&s;e, and wrapping on the lid of his &s;nuff|box.</P>
<P>All which infinitely diverted Mrs. Tattle; who, when &s;he could &s;top her&s;elf from laughing, "declared it made her &s;igh too, to think of the life poor Mrs. Carbuncle led with that man, and all for nothing too; for her jointure was nothing, next to nothing, though a great thing to be &s;ure her friends thought for her, when &s;he was only Sally Ridgeway, before &s;he was married. Such a wife as &s;he makes! continued Mrs. There&s;a, lifting up her hands and eyes to Heaven, and &s;o much as &s;he has gone through, the brute ought to be a&s;hamed of him|&s;elf if he does not leave her &s;ome|thing extraordinary in his will; for, turn it which way &s;he will, &s;he can never keep a carriage, or live like
<PB N="123" REF="121">any body el&s;e, on her jointure, after all. She tells me, poor &s;oul! a &s;ad pro&s;pect after her hu&s;band's death, to look forward to, in&s;tead of being comfortable, as her friends expected; and &s;he, poor young thing, know|ing no better when they married her.

<P>"Cry! Ble&s;s me," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, "mighty odd! very extra|ordinary! but one can't be &s;urpri&s;ed at meeting with extraordinary cha|racters among&s;t that race of people. Actors, by profe&s;&s;ion you know, who are brought up from the egg to make their fortune, or at lea&s;t their bread by their oddities. But, my dear Mr. Frederick, you are quite pale, quite exhau&s;ted; no wonder; what will you have, a gla&s;s of cow&s;lip wine?"</P>
<P>"Oh, no, thank you, ma'am," &s;aid Frederick.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="130">
"Oh, yes; indeed you mu&s;t not leave me without taking &s;omething; and Mi&s;s Marianne mu&s;t have ano|ther macaroon; I in&s;i&s;t upon it," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, ringing the bell. "It is not late, and my man Chri&s;topher will bring up the cow&s;lip wine in a minute."</P>
<P>"But Sophy! and Papa and Mamma you know will come home ju&s;t now," &s;aid Marianne.</P>
<P>"Oh, Mi&s;s Sophy has her books and drawings, you know, &s;he's never afraid of being alone; be&s;ides, to-night it was her own choice; and as to your Papa and Mamma, they won't be home to-night, I'm pretty &s;ure, for a gentleman, who had it from their own authority, told me where they were going, which is far|ther off than they think, but they
<PB N="133" REF="131">did not con&s;ult me; and I fancy they'll be obliged to &s;leep out, &s;o you need not be in a hurry about them. We'll have candles."</P>
<P>The door opened ju&s;t as Mrs. Tat|tle was going to ring the bell again for candles, and the cow&s;lip wine. "Chri&s;topher! Chri&s;topher!" &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, who was &s;tanding at the fire, with her back to the door when it opened. "Chri&s;topher! pray bring&mdash;Do you hear?" But no Chri&s;|topher an&s;wered; and, upon turning round, Mrs. Tattle, in&s;tead of Chri&s;|topher, beheld two little black figures, which &s;tood perfectly &s;till and &s;ilent. It was &s;o dark that their forms could &s;carcely be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>"In the name of Heaven who, and what may you be? Speak, I conjure you! What are ye?"</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="132">
"The chimney &s;weepers, ma'am, an' plea&s;e your lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Chimney &s;weepers," repeated Frederick and Marianne, bur&s;ting out a laughing.</P>
<P>"Chimney &s;weepers!" repeated Mrs. There&s;a, provoked at the recol|lection of her late &s;olemn addre&s;s to them. "Chimney &s;weepers! and could not you &s;ay &s;o a little &s;ooner? And pray what brings you here, gentlemen, at this time of night?"</P>
<P>"The bell rang ma'am," an|&s;wered the &s;queaking voice.</P>
<P>"The bell rang! yes, for Chri&s;|topher. The boy's mad, or drunk."</P>
<P>"Ma'am," &s;aid the talle&s;t of the chimney &s;weepers, who had not yet &s;poken, and who now began in a very blunt manner; "Ma'am, your bro|ther de&s;ired us to come up when the bell rang; &s;o we did."</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="133">
"My brother, I have no brother, dunce," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a.</P>
<P>"Mr. Eden, madam."</P>
<P>"Oh, ho!" &s;aid Mrs. Tattle, in a more complacent tone, "the boy takes me for Mi&s;s Birtha Eden, I per|ceive;" and, flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney &s;weeper, for a young and hand&s;ome lady, Mrs. There&s;a laughed, and informed him, "that they had mi&s;taken the room; that they mu&s;t go up another pair of &s;tairs, and turn to the left."</P>
<P>The chimney &s;weeper with the &s;queaking voice, bowed, thanked her lady&s;hip for this information, &s;aid, "Good night to ye quality;" and they both moved towards the door.</P>
<P>"Stay," &s;aid Mrs. Tattle, who&s;e curio&s;ity was excited, "What can the
<PB N="136" REF="134">Edens want with chimney &s;weepers at this time o'night, I wonder? Chri&s;|topher, did you hear any thing about it?" &s;aid the lady to her footman, who was now lighting the candles.</P>
<P>"Upon my word, ma'am," &s;aid the &s;ervant, "I can't &s;ay, but I'll &s;tep down below and enquire. I heard them talking about it in the kitchen, but I only got a word here and there, for I was hunting for the &s;nuff-di&s;h, as I knew it mu&s;t be for candles, when I heard the bell ring, ma'am, &s;o I thought to find the &s;nuff-di&s;h before I an&s;wered the bell, for I knew it mu&s;t be for candles you rang. But if you plea&s;e I'll &s;tep down now, ma'am, and &s;ee about the chimney-&s;weeps."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;tep down, do, and Chri&s;|topher, bring up the cow&s;lip wine, and &s;ome more macaroons for my lit|tle Marianne."</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="135">
Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a ki&s;s which Mrs. Tattle was going to give her, for &s;he was &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her foot|man. She had not been u&s;ed to the&s;e manners in her father and mother, and &s;he did not like them.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Mrs. Tattle to Chri&s;topher, who was now returned, "what is the news?"</P>
<P>"Ma'am, the little fellow with the &s;queaking voice has been telling me the whole &s;tory. The other morn|ing, ma'am, early, he and the other were down the hill, &s;weeping in Paradi&s;e-row; tho&s;e chimnies, they &s;ay, are difficult; and the &s;quare fel|low, ma'am, the bigge&s;t of the two boys, got wedged in the chimney; the other little fellow was up at the top at
<PB N="138" REF="136">the time, and he heard the cry, but in his fright and all he did not know what to do, ma'am, for he looked about from the top of the chimney, and not a &s;oul could he &s;ee &s;tirring, but a few that he could not make mind his &s;creech. The boy within almo&s;t &s;tifling too. So he &s;creeched, and &s;creeched, all he could; and by the greate&s;t chance in life, ma'am, old Mr. Eden was ju&s;t going down the hill to fetch his morning walk."</P>
<P>"Aye," interrupted Mrs. There&s;a, "friend Ephraim is one of your early ri&s;ers."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Marianne, impa|tlently.</P>
<P>"So, ma'am, hearing the &s;creech, he turns and &s;ees the &s;weep, and the moment he under&s;tands the mat|ter&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="137">
"I'm &s;ure he mu&s;t have taken &s;ome time to under&s;tand it," interpo&s;ed Mrs. Tattle, "for he's the &s;lowe&s;t creature breathing, and the deafe&s;t in company. Go on, Chri&s;topher. So the Sweep did make him hear?"</P>
<P>"So he &s;ays, ma'am; and &s;o the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney, with much ado, ma'am."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me!" exclaimed Mrs. There&s;a, but did old Eden go up the chimney him&s;elf after the boy, wig and all?"</P>
<P>"Why, ma'am," &s;aid Chri&s;topher, with a look of great delight, "that was all as one, as the very 'dentical words I put to the boy my&s;elf when he telled me his &s;tory. But, ma'am, that was what I could n't get out of him neither, rightly, for he is a
<PB N="140" REF="138">churl; the big boy that was &s;tuck in the chimney, I mean, for when I put the que&s;tion to him about the wig, laughing like, he would n't take it laughing like at all, but would only make an&s;wer to us like a bear, "He &s;aved my life, that's all I know;" and this over again, ma'am, to all the kitchen round, that cro&s;s-que&s;tioned him. So when I finds him &s;o &s;tupid and ill-mannered like (for I offered him a &s;hilling, ma'am, my&s;elf, to tell about the wig) but he put it back in a ways that did not become &s;uch as he, to no lady's butler, ma'am: whereupon I turns to the &s;lim fellow, and he's &s;marterer and more manner|ly, ma'am, with a tongue in his head for his betters, but he could not re|&s;olve me my que&s;tion neither, for he was up at the top of the chimney the be&s;t part o' the time; and when he
<PB N="141" REF="139">came down, Mr. Eden had his wig on, but had his arm all bare and bloody, ma'am."</P>
<P>"Poor Mr. Eden!" exclaimed Marianne.</P>
<P>"Oh, Mi&s;s," continued the &s;er|vant, "and the chimney-&s;weep him|&s;elf was &s;o brui&s;ed, and mu&s;t have been killed."</P>
<P>"Well, well! but he's alive now; go on with your &s;tory, Chri&s;topher," &s;aid Mrs. T. "Chimney &s;weepers get wedged in chimnies every day, its part of their trade, and its a happy thing when they come off with a few brui&s;es. To be &s;ure," added &s;he, ob|&s;erving that both Frederick and Ma|rianne looked di&s;plea&s;ed at this &s;peech, "to be &s;ure, if one may be lieve this &s;tory, there was &s;ome real danger."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="140">
"Real danger! yes, indeed," &s;aid Marianne, "and I'm &s;ure I think Mr. Eden was very good."</P>
<P>"Certainly, it was a mo&s;t com|mendable action, and quite providen|tial; &s;o I &s;hall take an opportunity of &s;aying, when I tell the &s;tory in all companies; and the boy may thank his kind &s;tars, I'm &s;ure, to the end of his days for &s;uch an e&s;cape. But pray, Chri&s;topher," &s;aid &s;he, per&s;i&s;t|ing in her conver&s;ation with Chri&s;|topher, who was now laying the cloth for &s;upper, "Pray which hou&s;e was it in Paradi&s;e-row? where the Eagles, or the Mi&s;s Ropers lodge? or which?"</P>
<P>"It was at my lady Batter&s;by's, ma'am."</P>
<P>"Ha! ha!" cried Mrs. There&s;a, "I thought we &s;hould get to the bot|tom of the affair at la&s;t. This is ex|cellent!
<PB N="143" REF="141">This will make an admirable &s;tory for my lady Batter&s;by the next time I &s;ee her. The&s;e Quakers are &s;o &s;ly!&mdash;Old Eden I know has long wanted to get him&s;elf introduced in that hou&s;e, and a charming charitable expedient he hit upon! My lady Bat|ter&s;by will enjoy this of all things."</P>

<P>"NOW," continued Mrs. There&s;a, turning to Frederick, as &s;oon as the &s;ervant had left the room, "now, Mr. Frederick Montague, I have a favour&mdash;&s;uch a favour to a&s;k of you&mdash;its a favour which only you can grant; you have &s;uch talents, and would do the thing &s;o admirably! and my lady Batter&s;by would quite adore you for it. She will do me the honour to be here to &s;pend an evening to-morrow. I'm convinced Mr. and Mrs. Montague will find them&s;elves obliged to &s;tay out
<PB N="146" REF="143">another day; and I &s;o long to &s;hew you off to her lady&s;hip; and your doctor Carbuncle, and your coun&s;ellor Puff, and your Mi&s;s Croker, and all your charming characters. You mu&s;t let me introduce you to her lady&s;hip to-morrow evening. Promi&s;e me."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh, ma'am," &s;aid Frederick, "I cannot promi&s;e you any &s;uch thing, indeed. I am much obliged to you, but I cannot come indeed."</P>
<P>"Why not, my dear &s;ir? Why not? You don't think I mean you &s;hould promi&s;e, if you are certain your Papa and Mamma will be home."</P>
<P>"If they do come home I will a&s;k them about it," &s;aid Frederick, he&s;i|tating for though he by no means wi&s;hed to accept of the invitation, he had not yet acquired the nece&s;&s;ary power of &s;aying NO decidedly.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="144">
"A&s;k them!" repeated Mrs. There&s;a, "my dear &s;ir, at your age, mu&s;t you a&s;k your Papa and Mamma about &s;uch things?"</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t! no ma'am," &s;aid Fre|derick; "but I &s;aid I would; I know I need not, becau&s;e my fa|ther and mother always let me judge for my&s;elf about every thing al|mo&s;t."</P>
<P>"And about this I am &s;ure," cried Marianne; Papa and Mamma you know, ju&s;t as they were go|ing away, &s;aid, "If Mrs. There&s;a a&s;ks you to come, do as you think be&s;t."</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, "you know it re&s;ts with your|&s;elves, if you may do as you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure I may, madam," &s;aid Frederick, colouring from that
<PB N="148" REF="145">&s;pecies of emotion which is ju&s;tly called fal&s;e &s;hame, which often con|quers real &s;hame, "to be &s;ure, ma'am, I may do as I plea&s;e."</P>
<P>"Then I may make &s;ure of you," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, "for now it would be down right rudene&s;s to tell a lady you won't do as &s;he plea&s;es. Mr. Frederick Montague, I'm &s;ure, is too well bred a young gentleman to do &s;o impolite, &s;o ungallant a thing!"</P>
<P>The jarcon of politene&s;s and gal|lantry is frequently brought by the &s;illy acquaintance of young people, to confu&s;e their &s;imple morality and clear good &s;en&s;e. A new and unin|telligible &s;y&s;tem is pre&s;ented to them, in a language foreign to their under|&s;tanding, and contradictory to their feelings. They he&s;itate between new motives and old principles; from the
<PB N="149" REF="146">fear of being thought ignorant, they become affected; and from the dread of being thought to be children, act like fools. But all this they feel, only when they are in the company of &s;uch people as Mrs. There&s;a Tat|tle.</P>
<P>"Ma'am," Frederick began, "I don't mean to be rude, but I hope you'll excu&s;e me from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow, becau&s;e my father and mother are not ac|quainted with lady Batter&s;by, and may be they might not like&mdash;</P>
<P>"Take care, take care," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, laughing at his perplexity, you want to get off from obliging me, and you don't know how. You had very nearly made a mo&s;t &s;hocking blunder, in putting it all upon poor lady Batter&s;by. Now you know its impo&s;&s;ible Mr. and Mrs. Montague
<PB N="150" REF="147">could have in nature, the &s;lighte&s;t objection to my introducing you to my lady Batter&s;by at my own hou&s;e; for don't you know, that be&s;ides her lady&s;hip's many unexceptionable qua|lities, which one need not talk of, &s;he is cou&s;in, but once removed to the Trotters of Lanca&s;hire, your mother's great favourites. And there is not a per&s;on at the Wells, I'll venture to &s;ay, could be of more advantage to your &s;i&s;ter Sophy, in the way of part|ners, when &s;he comes to go to the balls, which it's to be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he will &s;ome time or other; and as you are &s;o good a brother, that's a thing to be looked to, you know. Be&s;ides, as to your&s;elf, there's no|thing her lady&s;hip delights in &s;o much as in a good mimic; and &s;he'll quite adore you!"</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="148">
"But I don't want her to adore me, ma'am," &s;aid Frederick, bluntly; then correcting him&s;elf, added, "I mean for being a mimic."</P>
<P>"Why not, my love, between friends can there be any harm in &s;hewing one's talents, you that have &s;uch talents to &s;hew? She'll keep your &s;ecret, I'll an&s;wer for her; and, added &s;he, you need n't be afraid of her critici&s;m, for between you and I, &s;he's no great critic, &s;o you'll come. Well, thank you, that's &s;et|tled. How you have made me beg and pray; but you know your own value, I &s;ee, as you entertaining people always do. One mu&s;t a&s;k a wit, like a fine &s;inger, &s;o often. Well, but now for the favour I was going to a&s;k you."</P>
<P>Frederick looked &s;urpri&s;ed, for he thought that the favour of his com|pany
<PB N="152" REF="149">was what &s;he meant; but &s;he explained her&s;elf farther.</P>
<P>"The old Quaker who lodges above, Old Ephraim Eden, my lady Batter&s;by and I have &s;o much diver|&s;ion about him, he is the be&s;t cha|racter, the odde&s;t creature! If you were but to &s;ee him come into the rooms with tho&s;e &s;tiff &s;kirts, or walking with his eternal &s;i&s;ter Birtha, and his ever|la&s;ting broad brimmed hat, one knows him a mile off. But then his voice, and way, and all together, if one could get them to the life, they'd be better than any thing on the &s;tage; better even than any thing I've &s;een to-night; and I think you'd make a capital Quaker for my lady Batter&s;by; but then the thing is, one can never get to hear the old Quiz talk. Now you who have &s;o much invention and cleverne&s;s; I have no invention my|&s;elf,
<PB N="153" REF="150">but could not you hit upon &s;ome way of getting to &s;ee him, &s;o that you might get him by heart. I'm &s;ure you, who are &s;o quick, would only want to &s;ee him, and hear for half a minute, to be able to take him off, &s;o as to kill one with laughing. But I have no invention.</P>
<P>"Oh, as to the invention," &s;aid Frederick, "I know an admirable way of doing the thing, if that was all. But then remember, I don't &s;ay I will do the thing, for I will not. But I know a way of getting up into his room, and &s;eeing him, without his knowing I was there."</P>
<P>"O tell it me, you charming clever creature!"</P>
<P>"But remember, I do not &s;ay I will do it."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="151">
"Well, well, let us hear it, and you &s;hall do as you plea&s;e after|wards."</P>
<P>"Merciful goodne&s;s!" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, "do my ears deceive me? I declare I looked round and thought the &s;queaking chimney &s;weeper was in the room!"</P>
<P>"So did I, Frederick, I declare," cried Marianne, laughing, "I never heard any thing &s;o like his voice in my life."</P>
<P>Frederick imitated the &s;queaking voice of this chimney &s;weeper to great perfection.</P>
<P>"Now," continued he, "this fellow is ju&s;t my height; the old Quaker, if my face were blackened, and if I were to change cloaths with the chimney &s;weeper, I'll an&s;wer for it he would never know me."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="152">
"Oh, its an admirable invention, I give you infinite credit for it!" ex|claimed Mrs. There&s;a. "It &s;hall, it mu&s;t be done: I'll ring, and have the fellow up this minute."</P>
<P>"Oh, no; do not ring," &s;aid Fre|derick, &s;topping her hand, "I don't mean to do it. You know you pro|mi&s;ed that I &s;hould do as I plea&s;ed; I only told you my invention."</P>
<P>"Well, well, but only let me ring and a&s;k whether the chimney &s;weepers are below: you &s;hall do as you plea&s;e afterwards."</P>
<P>"Chri&s;topher, &s;hut the door; Chri&s;|topher," &s;aid &s;he to the &s;ervant, who came up when &s;he rang, "Pray are the &s;weeps gone yet?"</P>
<P>"No, ma'am."</P>
<P>"But have they been up to old Eden yet."</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="153">
"Oh, no, ma'am; nor be not to go till the bell rings, for Mi&s;s Birtha, ma'am, was a&s;leep, laying down, and her brother would n't have her wakened on no account what|&s;omever; he came down his &s;elf to the kitchen to the &s;weeps though; but would n't have, as I heard him &s;ay, his &s;i&s;ter waked for no account. But Mi&s;s Birtha's bell will ring, when &s;he wakens, for the &s;weeps, ma'am, t'was &s;he wanted to &s;ee the boy as her brother &s;aved, and I &s;up|po&s;e &s;ent for 'em to give 'em &s;ome|thing charitable, ma'am."</P>
<P>"Well, never mind your &s;uppo|&s;itions," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, "run down this very minute to the little &s;queaking chimney &s;weep, and &s;end him up to me. Quick, but don't let the other bear come up with him.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="154">
Chri&s;topher, who had curio&s;ity as well as his mi&s;tre&s;s, when he return|ed with the chimney &s;weeper, pro|longed his own &s;tay in the room by &s;weeping the hearth, throwing down the tongs and &s;hovel, and picking them up again.</P>
<P>"That will do, Chri&s;topher; Chri&s;|topher, that will do I &s;ay;" Mrs. There&s;a repeated in vain. She was obliged to &s;ay, "Chri&s;topher you may go," before he would depart.</P>
<P>"Now," &s;aid &s;he to Frederick, "&s;tep in here to the next room, with this candle, and you'll be equipped in an in&s;tant. Only ju&s;t change cloaths with the boy; only ju&s;t let me &s;ee what a charming chimney &s;weeper you'd make; you &s;hall do as you plea&s;e afterwards."</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="155">
"Well, I'll only change cloaths with him ju&s;t to &s;hew you for one minute."</P>
<P>"But," &s;aid Marianne to Mrs. There&s;a, whil&s;t Frederick was changing his cloaths, "I think Frederick is right about"&mdash;</P>
<P>"About what, love?"</P>
<P>"I think he is in the right not to go up, though he can do it &s;o ea&s;ily, to &s;ee that gentleman, I mean on purpo&s;e to mimic and laugh at him afterwards; I don't think that would be quite right."</P>
<P>"Why, pray, Mi&s;s Marianne?"</P>
<P>"Why, becau&s;e he is &s;o good na|tured to his &s;i&s;ter. He would not let her be wakened."</P>
<P>"Dear, its ea&s;y to be good in &s;uch little things; and he won't have long
<PB N="159" REF="156">to be good to her neither; for I don't think &s;he'll trouble him long in this world any how."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" &s;aid Ma|rianne.</P>
<P>"That &s;he'll die, child."</P>
<P>"Die! die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks! How &s;orry her poor, poor brother will be. But &s;he will not die, I'm &s;ure, for &s;he walks about, and runs up &s;tairs &s;o lightly! O you mu&s;t be quite entirely mi&s;taken, I hope."</P>
<P>"If I'm mi&s;taken, Dr. Panado Cardimum's mi&s;taken too then, that's my comfort. He &s;ays, unle&s;s the waters work a miracle, &s;he &s;tands a bad chance; and &s;he won't follow my advice, and con&s;ult the doctor for her health."</P>
<P>"He would frighten her to death, perhaps," &s;aid Marianne. "I hope
<PB N="160" REF="157">Frederick won't go up to di&s;turb her."</P>
<P>"Lud, child, you are turned &s;im|pleton all of a &s;udden, how can your brother di&s;turb her more than the real chimney &s;weeper?"</P>
<P>"But I don't think its right," per|&s;i&s;ted Marianne, "and I &s;hall tell him &s;o."</P>
<P>"Nay, Mi&s;s Marianne, I don't commend you now; young ladies &s;hould not be &s;o forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers una&s;ked; and Mr. Frede|rick, and I, I pre&s;ume, mu&s;t know what's right, as well as Mi&s;s Ma|rianne. Hu&s;h! here he is! O the capital figure, cried Mrs. There&s;a! Bravo! bravo! cried &s;he, as Frede|rick entered in the chimney &s;weeper's dre&s;s, and as he &s;poke, &s;aying,</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="158">
"I'm afraid, plea&s;e your lady&s;hip, to dirty your lady&s;hip's carpet."</P>
<P>She broke out into immoderate raptures, calling him "her charming chimney &s;weeper!" and repeating that &s;he knew before hand the character would do for him.</P>
<P>She in&s;tantly rung the bell, in &s;pite of all expo&s;tulation&mdash;ordered Chri&s;|topher to &s;end up the other chimney &s;weeper&mdash;triumphed in ob&s;erving, that Chri&s;topher did not in the lea&s;t know Frederick when he came into the room; and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney &s;weeper would mi&s;take him for his companion.&mdash;And &s;o he did: and when Frederick &s;poke, the voice was &s;o very like, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have perceived the difference.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="159">
Marianne was diverted by this &s;cene, but &s;he &s;tarted, when in the mid&s;t of it they heard a bell ring.</P>
<P>"That's the lady's bell, and we mu&s;t go," &s;aid the blunt chimney &s;weeper.</P>
<P>"Go, then, about your bu&s;ine&s;s, and here's a &s;hilling for you to drink, my hone&s;t fellow. I did not know you were &s;o much brui&s;ed when I fir&s;t &s;aw you&mdash;I won't detain you. Go," &s;aid &s;he, pu&s;hing Frederick towards the door.</P>
<P>Marianne &s;prang forward to &s;peak to him, but Mrs. There&s;a kept her off; and though Frederick re&s;i&s;ted, the lady &s;hut the door upon him by &s;uperior force; and having locked it, there was no retreat.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tattle, and Marianne, waited impatiently for Frederick's return.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="160">
"I hear them," cried Marianne. "I hear them coming down &s;tairs."</P>
<P>They li&s;tened again, and all was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At length they heard &s;uddenly a great noi&s;e of many &s;teps, and many voices in confu&s;ion in the hall.</P>
<P>"Merciful!" exclaimed Mrs. The|re&s;a, "it mu&s;t be your father and mother come back."</P>
<P>Marianne ran to unlock the room door, and Mrs. There&s;a followed her into the hall.</P>
<P>The hall was rather dark, but under the lamp a crowd of people. All the &s;ervants in the hou&s;e were gathered together.</P>
<P>As Mrs. There&s;a approached, the crowd opened in &s;ilence, and &s;he be|held in the mid&s;t Frederick, blood &s;treaming from his face; his head
<PB N="164" REF="161">was held by Chri&s;topher, and the chimney &s;weeper was holding a ba|&s;on for him.</P>
<P>"Merciful! Gracious Heaven! what will become of me!" exclaimed Mrs. There&s;a. "Bleeding! good God! he'll bleed to death! Can nobody think of any thing that will &s;top blood in a minute? A key&mdash;a large key down his back; a key&mdash;has nobody a key? Mr. and Mrs. Montague will be here before he has done bleeding. A key! Cobwebs! a puff-ball! for mercy's &s;ake! Can nobody think of any thing that will &s;top blood in a minute! Gracious me! he'll bleed to death, I be|lieve!"</P>
<P>"He'll bleed to death! O my brother!" cried Marianne, catching hold of the words, and terrified, &s;he
<PB N="165" REF="162">ran up &s;tairs, crying, "Sophy! O Sophy! come down this minute, or he'll be dead! my brother's bleeding to death.&mdash;Sophy! Sophy! come down, or he'll be dead!"</P>
<P>"Let go the ba&s;on, you," &s;aid Chri&s;topher, pulling the ba&s;on out of the chimney &s;weeper's hand, who had all this time &s;tood in &s;ilence, "you are not fit to hold the ba&s;on for a gen|tleman."</P>
<P>"Let him hold it," &s;aid Frede|rick, "he did not mean to hurt me."</P>
<P>"That's more than he de&s;erves. I'm certain &s;ure he might have known well enough it was Mr. Frederick all the time, and he'd no bu&s;ine&s;s to go to fight&mdash;&s;uch a one as he, with a gentleman."</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="163">
"I did not know he was a gentle|man," &s;aid the chimney &s;weeper, "How could I?"</P>
<P>"How could he indeed?" &s;aid Frederick, "he &s;hall hold the ba&s;on."</P>
<P>"Gracious me! I'm glad to hear him &s;peak like him&s;elf again, at any rate," cried Mrs. There&s;a. "Lord ble&s;s us! and here comes Mi&s;s So|phy too."</P>
<P>"Sophy!" cried Frederick, "Oh, Sophy! don't you come&mdash;don't look at me, you'll de&s;pi&s;e me."</P>
<P>"My brother! where! where!" &s;aid Sophy, looking, as &s;he thought, at the two chimney &s;weepers.</P>
<P>"Its Frederick," &s;aid Marianne, "that's my brother."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Sophy, don't be alarmed," Mrs. There&s;a began, "but gracious goodne&s;s, I wi&s;h Mi&s;s Birtha"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="164">
At this in&s;tant, a female figure in white appeared upon the &s;tairs; &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;wiftly on, whil&s;t every one gave way before her.</P>
<P>"Oh, Mi&s;s Birtha!" cried Mrs. There&s;a, catching hold of her gown to &s;top her as &s;he came near Fre|derick, "Oh, Mi&s;s Eden, your beau|tiful India mu&s;lin!&mdash;take care of the chimney &s;weeper, for Heaven's &s;ake." &mdash;But &s;he pre&s;&s;ed forwards.</P>
<P>"Its my brother; will he die?" cried Marianne, throwing her arms round her, and looking up as if to a being of a &s;uperior order, "Will he bleed to death?"</P>
<P>"No, my love!" an&s;wered a &s;weet voice, "do not frighten thy|&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I've done bleeding," &s;aid Fre|derick.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="165">
"Dear me, Mi&s;s Marianne, if you would not make &s;uch a rout," cried Mrs. Tattle. "Mi&s;s Birtha, its no|thing but a frolic. You &s;ee Mr. Fre|derick Montague only in a ma&s;querade dre&s;s. Nothing in the world but a frolic, ma'am. You &s;ee he &s;tops bleeding. I was frightened out of my wits at fir&s;t; I thought it was his eye, but I &s;ee it is only his no&s;e; all's well that ends well. Mr. Frede|rick, we'll keep your coun&s;el. Pray, ma'am, let us a&s;k no que&s;tions, its only a boyi&s;h frolic. Come Mr. Frede|rick this way, into my room, and I'll give you a towel, and &s;ome clean water, and you can get rid of this ma&s;querade dre&s;s. Make ha&s;te, for fear your father and mother &s;hould pop in upon us."</P>
<P>"Do not be afraid of thy father and mother, they are &s;urely thy be&s;t
<PB N="169" REF="166">friends," &s;aid a mild voice. It was the voice of an elderly gentleman who now &s;tood behind Frederick.</P>
<P>"Oh, &s;ir! Oh, Mr. Eden!" &s;aid Frederick, turning to him&mdash;</P>
<P>"Don't betray me! for goodne&s;s &s;ake, &s;ay nothing about me," whi&s;|pered Mrs. Tattle.</P>
<P>"I am not thinking about you&mdash;Let me &s;peak," cried he, pu&s;hing away her hand, which &s;topped his mouth, "I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about you, I promi&s;e you," &s;aid Frederick, with a look of contempt.</P>
<P>"No, but for your own &s;ake, my dear &s;ir, your Papa and Mamma! Ble&s;s me! is not that Mrs. Monta|gue's carriage?"</P>
<P>"My brother, ma'am," &s;aid So|phy, "is not afraid of my father and mother's coming back. Let him
<PB N="170" REF="167">&s;peak&mdash;he was going to &s;peak the truth."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure, Mi&s;s Sophy, I would n't hinder him from &s;peaking the truth; but its not proper, I pre&s;ume, ma'am, to &s;peak truth at all times, and in all places, and before every body, &s;ervants and all. I only want|ed, ma'am, to hinder your brother from expo&s;ing him&s;elf. A hall, I apprehend, is not a proper place for explanations."</P>
<P>"Here," &s;aid Mr. Eden, opening the door of his room, which was on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hall to Mrs. Tattle's, "Here is a place," &s;aid he to Frederick, "where thou maye&s;t &s;peak the truth at all times, and be|fore every body."</P>
<P>"Nay, my room's at Mr. Frede|rick Montague's &s;ervice, and my
<PB N="171" REF="168">door's open too. This way, pray," &s;aid &s;he, pulling his arm.</P>
<P>But Frederick broke from her, and followed Mr. Eden.</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir, will you forgive me!" cried he.</P>
<P>"Forgive thee!&mdash;and what have I to forgive?"</P>
<P>"Forgive, brother, without a&s;k|ing what," &s;aid Birtha, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"He &s;hall know all," cried Frede|rick; "all that concerns my&s;elf, I mean. Sir, I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf in this dre&s;s; I came up to your room to|night on purpo&s;e to &s;ee you, without your knowing it, that I might mimic you. The chimney &s;weeper&mdash;where is he?" &s;aid Frederick, looking round, and he ran into the hall to &s;ee for him&mdash;"May he come in? he may&mdash;he is a brave, an hone&s;t, good, grateful boy. He never gue&s;&s;ed who I was;
<PB N="172" REF="169">after we left you, we went down to the kitchen together, and there I, fool that I was, for the plea&s;ure of making Mr. Chri&s;topher and the &s;er|vants laugh, began to mimic you. This boy &s;aid, he would not &s;tand by and hear you laughed at;&mdash;that you had &s;aved his life;&mdash;that I ought to be a&s;hamed of my&s;elf;&mdash;that you had ju&s;t given me half-a-crown:&mdash;and &s;o you had;&mdash;but I went on, and told him, I'd knock him down if he &s;aid another word.&mdash;He did&mdash;I gave the fir&s;t blow&mdash;we fought&mdash;I came to the ground&mdash;the &s;ervants pulled me up again.&mdash;They found out, I don't know how, that I was not a chimney &s;weeper&mdash;the re&s;t you &s;aw. And now can you forgive me, Sir," &s;aid Fre|derick to Mr. Eden, &s;eizing hold of his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="170">
"The other hand, friend," &s;aid the Quaker, gently withdrawing his right hand, which every body now ob&s;erved being much &s;welled, he put it in his bo&s;om again&mdash;"This hand and wel|come," &s;aid he, offering his other hand to Frederick, and &s;haking his with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>"O that other hand!" &s;aid Frede|rick, "that was hurt I remember.&mdash; How ill I have behaved&mdash;extremely ill.&mdash;But this is a le&s;&s;on that I &s;hall never forget as long as I live. I hope for the future I &s;hall behave like a gentleman."</P>
<P>"And like a man&mdash;and like a good man, I am &s;ure thou wilt," &s;aid the good Quaker, &s;haking Frederick's hand affectionately, "or I am much mi&s;taken friend in that black counte|nance."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="171">
"You are not mi&s;taken," cried Marianne, "Frederick will never be per&s;uaded again by any body to do what he does not think right; and now, brother, you may wa&s;h your black countenance."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance, a double knock was heard at the door. It was Mr. and Mrs. Montague&mdash;who went into the hall to meet them.</P>
<P>"What will you do now?" whi&s;|pered Mrs. There&s;a to Frederick, as his father and mother came into the room.</P>
<P>"A chimney &s;weeper! covered with blood!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Montague.</P>
<P>"Father, I am Frederick," &s;aid he, &s;tepping forward towards them as they &s;tood in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="172">
"Frederick! my &s;on!"</P>
<P>'Yes, mother, I'm not hurt half &s;o much as I de&s;erve; I'll tell you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay," interrupted Birtha, "let my brother tell the &s;tory this time, thou ha&s;t told it once, and told it well&mdash;no one but my brother could tell it better."</P>
<P>"A &s;tory never tells &s;o well the &s;econd time, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Mrs. There&s;a, "but Mr. Eden will cer|tainly make the be&s;t of it."</P>
<P>Without taking any notice of Mrs. Tattle, or her apprehen&s;ive looks, Mr. Eden explained all that he knew of the affair in a few words, "your &s;on," concluded he, "will quickly put off this dirty dre&s;s&mdash;the dre&s;s hath not &s;tained the mind&mdash;that is fair and honourable. When he felt him&s;elf in the wrong, he &s;aid &s;o; nor was he in ha&s;te to conceal his adventure from
<PB N="176" REF="173">his father; this made me think well of both father and &s;on. I &s;peak plain|ly, friend, for that is be&s;t. But what is become of the other chimney &s;weeper? he will want to go home," &s;aid Mr. Eden, turning to Mrs. There&s;a.</P>
<P>Without making any reply, &s;he hurried out of the room as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and returned in a few mo|ments, with a look of extreme con|&s;ternation,</P>
<P>"Good Heaven! here is a cata|&s;trophe, indeed!&mdash;now indeed, Mr. Frederick, your Papa and Mamma, have rea&s;on to be angry. A new &s;uit of cloaths!&mdash;the bare-faced villain!&mdash;gone!&mdash;no &s;ign of them in my clo&s;et, or any where&mdash;the door was locked&mdash;he mu&s;t have gone up the chimney, out upon the leads, and &s;o
<PB N="177" REF="174">e&s;caped; but Chri&s;topher is after him. I prote&s;t, Mrs. Montague, you take it too quietly.&mdash;The wretch!&mdash;a new &s;uit of cloaths, blue coat and buff wai&s;tcoat.&mdash;I never heard of &s;uch a thing!&mdash;I declare, Mr. Montague, you are va&s;tly good now not to be in a pa&s;&s;ion," added Mrs. There&s;a.</P>
<P>"Madam," replied Mr. Montague, with a look of much civil contempt, "I think the lo&s;s of a &s;uit of cloaths, and even the di&s;grace that my &s;on has been brought to this evening, fortunate circum&s;tances in his educa|tion. He will, I am per&s;uaded, judge and act for him&s;elf more wi&s;ely in future; nor will he be tempted to offend again&s;t humanity, for the &s;ake of being called, "The be&s;t Mimic in the World."</P>
