<P>THE propriety of addre&s;&s;ing the &s;ub&s;equent Remarks on Medical Ju|ri&s;prudence to you, appeared obvious&mdash;and I am convinced, if they are deemed important by your Lord&s;hip, will not be con&s;idered as intru&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are three important ca&s;es in which Surgeons are particularly called up|on to a&s;certain by di&s;&s;ection the cau&s;e of death. Fir&s;t, where external injury has been &s;uffered. Secondly, where it is &s;u&s;pected poi&s;on has been admini&s;tered. Thirdly, where a woman is accu&s;ed of having mur|dered her child. The&s;e are occa&s;ions which require in the &s;urgeon a practical knowledge of anatomy, without which he can never ac|curately di&s;tingui&s;h appearances that may ari&s;e from injury or di&s;ea&s;e, from tho&s;e &s;pontaneous changes all dead bodies nece&s;&s;a|rily undergo. A good practical anatomi&s;t is rare among &s;urgeons, even in a great city,
<PB N="2" REF="6">and &s;eldom or never to be met with in the country; from this defect many dreadful mi&s;takes have been committed, to the &s;can|dal of the profe&s;&s;ion, and irretrievable in|jury of the per&s;on accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE are no fituations in which the ge|neral malignity of popular clamour is more con&s;picuous than in tho&s;e of &s;uppo&s;ed mur|der: no &s;ooner is a per&s;on &s;u&s;pected, than the rumour of it rapidly &s;preads, and as it flies exaggerates every circum&s;tance that may tend to criminate the unhappy culprit. To young practitioners tho&s;e are e&s;teemed favourable occa&s;ions for di&s;playing their medical di&s;crimination and attracting pub|lic attention: Opinions are ha&s;tily promul|gated, generally contradictory, often ab|&s;urd, and frequently grounded on &s;uppo|&s;itious facts. The con&s;equence is, that the accu&s;ed is publickly condemned before he is juridically tried, and falls at la&s;t, per|haps an innocent victim to popular preju|dice. I have on many occa&s;ions been pre&s;ent at inque&s;ts where the attending &s;urgeon, unu&s;ed to di&s;&s;ection, did not even know the method of expo&s;ing to view the different cavities of the body; and it may readily be conceived how little capable he mu&s;t have been to decide on &s;o important a point.
<PB N="3" REF="7">Yet in tho&s;e ca&s;es the &s;urgeon, when called on, has no alternative; he mu&s;t either avow his ignorance, or deliver his opinion; and in the &s;truggle between con&s;cience and pride, I very much fear the former is often &s;acri|ficed to the latter.</P>
<P>THERE is not (I will affirm) on record a more melancholy and &s;triking in&s;tance of the unhappy effects of popular prejudice, and the fatal con&s;equences of medical igno|rance than the ca&s;e of Captain Donnellan, who was executed in England about ten years ago, for the murder of Sir Theodo|&s;ius Boughton: It appears that eight or nine days after Sir Theodo&s;ius was buried, a &s;urgeon had the body rai&s;ed, although it was in the month of June, and proceeded to the di&s;&s;ection, notwith&s;tanding a phy&s;i|cian and another &s;urgeon pre&s;ent declared that, from the putrid &s;tate of the body, no information could be obtained on which any opinion could be grounded re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of death; and that &s;uch an inve&s;ti|gation was even attended with much per|&s;onal danger: yet regardle&s;s of this joint opinion and advice, the fir&s;t &s;urgeon pro|ceeded in the di&s;&s;ection, &s;aying, that to him &s;uch a &s;ubject was rather a <HI>po&s;y;</HI> and de|cidedly gave his opinion, that Sir Theo|do&s;ius died of poi&s;on, nor could the te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="4" REF="8">of the celebrated John Hunter, who &s;wore that it was impo&s;&s;ible to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of death in &s;uch a &s;tate of gene|ral putrefaction, do away the impre&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t evidence, on either the mind of the Judge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The judge is always con&s;idered as the advocate of the pri&s;oner;&mdash;in Capt. Donnellan's ca&s;e he &s;eems to have acted as lawyer for the crown.</NOTE> or Jury; for the fir&s;t, in his charge, oppo&s;es to the opinion of Hunter, which he &s;ays, he can call but a doubt, the po&s;itive declaration of the fir&s;t &s;urgeon who opened the body and of &s;ome phy&s;icians, that the decea&s;ed died of poi&s;on. Now Hunter's opinion was po&s;itive as to the phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibility of deciding on the cau&s;e of death, and only doubtful when interrogated as to the admini&s;tration of poi&s;on. In this country a ca&s;e not long &s;ince happened, where the medical men concerned decided that a man died of poi|&s;on; and I have very good rea&s;on to believe his death happened in con&s;equence of a rupture.&mdash;The unfortunate accu&s;ed in both ca&s;es were convicted, and &s;uffered an igno|minious death, for crimes they, both, at their dying moments, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner denied.</P>
<P>No &s;tronger in&s;tances can be adduced of the fatal and melancholy effects of popular
<PB N="5" REF="9">prejudice when joined with medical igno|rance. From this it appears how nece&s;&s;ary it is for &s;urgeons to avail them&s;elves of every opportunity that may tend to im|prove them in practical anatomy, by which they will acquire a knowledge of the na|tural appearance of the contents of the dif|ferent cavities, and when called on, be able to di&s;criminate with accuracy between a &s;ound and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the parts, and not mi&s;take tho&s;e changes which take place after death for morbid appearances, a cir|cum&s;tance that I have known &s;ometimes to have happened to experienced &s;urgeons not u&s;ed to di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>WHEN it is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pect a body, in order to a&s;certain the cau&s;e of death, the &s;ooner afterdeath the in&s;pection takes place the more accurate the inve&s;tigation will prove. As tho&s;e remarks are particularly addre&s;&s;ed to the younger part of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to point out the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances that &s;hould be at|tended to in the general order of the di&s;|&s;ection.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t object of enquiry &s;hould be in|to the principal circum&s;tances that attend|ed, and have been deemed to have occa&s;i|oned the per&s;on's death; for tho&s;e, when
<PB N="6" REF="10">known, will direct the &s;urgeon's attention in opening the body, to many important points that otherwi&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly (in the hurry of di&s;&s;ection) e&s;cape him. Fully informed as to all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, the body &s;hould be cleaned and placed on a ta|ble, in clear day-light; candle-light, for obvious rea&s;ons, is extremely improper on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The external appearances &s;hould be fir&s;t carefully examined, and we &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e bloody &s;uffu&s;ions and putrid di&s;ten&s;ions which al|ways rapidly take place after &s;udden death, in full habits, from tho&s;e that may ari&s;e from contu&s;ion or di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e are cir|cum&s;tances that require the utmo&s;t caution in the &s;urgeon, for people not u&s;ed to in|&s;pect dead bodies are very apt to be &s;truck by &s;uch appearances, and in&s;tantly decide that the per&s;on's death was cau&s;ed by &s;ome injury. After a careful examination of the external &s;urface of the body, we begin to open the different cavities, but fir&s;t the one in which we may expect to find the cau&s;e of death; if it proceeded from exter|nal injury, we cannot be at a lo&s;s where to begin; but if from poi&s;on, the &s;tate of the alimentary canal &s;hould be our principal object.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<P>AND here I mu&s;t reque&s;t the young prac|titioner &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid all un&s;ea&s;on|able levity, or making any remarks on the ca&s;e as he proceeds in the di&s;&s;ection, for the attendants are attentive and will recollect; and I have known &s;ome in&s;tances where the occa&s;ional remarks of the &s;urgeon and his ultimate deci&s;ion did not corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>THE three great cavities are tho&s;e we ge|nerally expo&s;e. I will begin with the head.</P>
<P>I NEED not remind the young &s;urgeon, that before he proceeds to open the head, he &s;hould have it clean &s;haved. In &s;hort, I cannot too &s;trongly recommend in di&s;&s;ecti|on, the utmo&s;t attention to cleanline&s;s, and a decorum that &s;hould prohibit the ex|po&s;ing unnece&s;&s;arily any parts that may hurt the feelings of the lookers on, or ca&s;t an injurious reflection on tho&s;e of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;calp ought to be fir&s;t carefully ex|amined. If there appears any contu&s;ion, wound, or &s;pontaneous &s;eparation of the pericranium from the &s;kull, the extent of tho&s;e different injuries &s;hould attentively be traced. We &s;hould next proceed to ex|amine the cranium, and let the young ope|rator be careful not to fall into the error of
<PB N="8" REF="12">Hippocrates, who mi&s;took a &s;uture or na|tural &s;ulcus for a fracture, all injuries of the bone &s;hould be traced and carefully attended to. The upper part of the crani|um being removed, the dura mater becomes expo&s;ed; this membrane in its natural &s;tate has a firm, va&s;cular, and filamentous connexion to the whole in&s;ide of the &s;kull, its detachment therefore in any part mu&s;t be the effect of violence or con&s;equence of di&s;ea&s;e. In large exten&s;ive fractures and depre&s;&s;ions where death has &s;uddenly fol|lowed, we frequently find a con&s;iderable detachment of the dura mater under the part injured, and more or le&s;s extrava&s;ated blood on its &s;urface; in other injuries of the cranium, it becomes &s;ub&s;equently de|tached by inflaming and &s;uppurating; but let me caution the &s;urgeon to proceed far|ther in his di&s;&s;ection, before he pronounces on the cau&s;e of death. Before we have done with the dura mater, the &s;tate of the &s;inu&s;es &s;hould be remarked, as they are frequently found in many injuries of the brain unna|turally di&s;tended with blood. We &s;hould then expo&s;e the pia mater to view; it is a va&s;cular web, and the connecting medium between the various ve&s;&s;els that pervade the brain. When death is the con&s;equence of concu&s;&s;ions of the brain or injuries of the cranium, we will find the cau&s;e of death
<PB N="9" REF="13">either in extrava&s;ation, &s;uppuration, or a ge|neral collap&s;ion of the brain, &s;o that it does not fill the cavity of the cranium. If death immediately &s;ucceeds the injury, we mu&s;t look for extrava&s;ation either on the &s;urfaces of the pia mater, corpus callo&s;um, in the ventricles or about the ba&s;is of the brain; for all &s;hocks which the head receives are readily communicated to the pia mater, and either produce a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the circu|lation through it (as happens when a man is knocked down or &s;tunned) or el&s;e &s;ome of the fine ve&s;&s;els are ruptured, and a fatal ex|trava&s;ation of blood en&s;ues. In the various injuries of the cranium which after &s;ome time cau&s;e death, we always find the &s;uppu|ration formed in the pia mater; for the effect of all concu&s;&s;ions are in&s;tantaneou&s;ly propa|gated throughout this va&s;cular membrane; and although a rupture of &s;ome of the finer ve&s;&s;els may not be produced, &s;till the tempo|rary derangement in the general circulation through the brain, particularly when com|bined with local injury, mu&s;t ever be looked on as a &s;trong exciting cau&s;e to future in|flammation and &s;uppuration; and this is every day confirmed by experience: for in more than five-and-twenty years exten&s;ive practice, in which time I have opened more heads than, I believe, mo&s;t other practiti|oners,
<PB N="10" REF="14">I never, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, found the contrary.</P>
<P>SHOULD our in&s;pection have for its object the a&s;certaining the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e, our en|quiry mu&s;t be directed by the leading &s;ymp|toms that attended it; apoplexy or hydro|cephalus are the two mo&s;t frequent occa&s;ions for &s;uch examination: in the fir&s;t extrava&s;a|tions of blood are frequently found in the ventricles from a rupture of &s;ome of the ve&s;|&s;els in the plexus choroides, or in the folds of the pia mater; in the &s;econd, we &s;hould take care not to mi&s;take the water, that is generally found in the ventricles, for a mor|bid accumulation.</P>
<P>As to other di&s;ea&s;ed appearances that may occur in di&s;&s;ections of the brain, &s;uch as &s;tea|toma and fungous tumors of the dura mater, tho&s;e enquiries do not admit of any particu|lar direction.</P>
<P>WE now proceed to the examination of the thorax; and, fir&s;t, we &s;hould carefully examine any wound that may externally ap|pear, and trace its traject: Ob&s;erve whether the ribs, &s;ternum, or dor&s;al vertebrae, be fractured. After this is done, the cavity of the thorax &s;hould be expo&s;ed. We &s;hould ex|amine
<PB N="11" REF="15">the different cavities, right and left, the duplicature of the pleura or media&s;tinum, the pericardium, and &s;ee whether there be extrava&s;ation of blood, water or matter, in any of tho&s;e different cavities. We &s;hould ob&s;erve whether the lungs fill the cavity of the thorax, or are in a collap&s;ed &s;tate, and perhaps wounded: it is often difficult to trace a wound through the lungs. I have more than once been embarra&s;&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;i|ons, and but for the extrava&s;ation in the ca|vities would have found it difficult to deter|mine whether the &s;word pa&s;&s;ed through the lungs or heart, for by the collap&s;ion of the parts the traject of the wound became effaced. Our next object &s;hould be to examine whe|ther the lungs are inflamed, gangrened, tu|bercular, or any part of them in a &s;tate of &s;uppuration: on tho&s;e points we may decide from their appearance, weight and den&s;ity, or by cutting into them, the large blood-ve&s;|&s;els, and the thoracic duct &s;hould next be in|&s;pected; and we &s;hould carefully look whe|ther aneuri&s;m, polypi, or wound has taken place in them. Having &s;atisfied our&s;elves as to tho&s;e different points, we proceed to open the abdomen.</P>
<P>THE external appearances as to wounds, contu&s;ions and fractures of the vertebrae,
<PB N="12" REF="16">&s;hould be fir&s;t enquired after; then the dif|ferent parts of the abdomen, where ruptures u&s;ually appear, &s;hould be carefully examined. In ca&s;es of &s;u&s;pected poi&s;on, great attention &s;hould be paid to this enquiry, for the &s;ymp|toms of a rupture under the circum&s;tances of &s;tricture may, by the ignorant, be imputed to the admini&s;tration of poi&s;on, as, in both ca&s;es, the patients are harra&s;&s;ed with ince&s;|&s;ant vomitings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Satisfied as to all tho&s;e points, we proceed to expo&s;e the cavity of the abdomen, and examine if it contains ex|trava&s;ations of water, matter or blood: the fir&s;t will be at once obvious; the &s;econd may be in the cellular membrane that envelopes the p&s;oas mu&s;cles, or lines the pelvis. Blood will generally de&s;cend and be found about Poupart's ligament. The different vi&s;cera next &s;hould be accurately in&s;pected, le&s;t any of them &s;hould be wounded, or in a di&s;|ea&s;ed &s;tate. I need not &s;urely remark, that the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, and organs of genera|tion lie out&s;ide the abdomen; and if there appears any nece&s;&s;ity for it, they may be &s;e|parately examined.</P>
<P>WE next proceed to open the alimentary canal; and ab&s;tracted from wounds, our en|quiry will be directed in general to a&s;certain whether poi&s;on had been admini&s;tered; this
<PB N="13" REF="17">we do by an accurate examination of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tinal canal, and a che|mical analy&s;is of their contents; but it will be fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary minutely to enquire into the leading circum&s;tances and &s;ymptoms that preceded the per&s;on's death. Poi&s;on is a very relative term. It is an old adage, that what is one man's meat is another man's poi&s;on. It depends not only on the quality, but the quantity, of the &s;ub&s;tance given, and its activity on the vehicle in which it is mixed or &s;u&s;pended. There are but few poi&s;ons that have not been medi|cinally admini&s;tered from time to time, without producing any dangerous com|plaints; nay, Morgagni affirms that moun|tebanks have been known to &s;wallow ar&s;enic rolled up in &s;uet, or lard, and retain it for &s;ome time in their &s;tomachs; then vomit it up, without &s;ub&s;taining the lea&s;t injury.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it is difficult to define poi&s;on medically, yet mankind judge rationally, and con&s;ider <HI>that</HI> as poi&s;on, which given in a certain quantity, induces &s;udden death, and which is admini&s;tered in &s;uch quantity for &s;uch purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>POISON may be drawn from the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. The two
<PB N="14" REF="18">fir&s;t will form the only objects of our pre|&s;ent enquiry, being the &s;ub&s;tances u&s;ually given for the purpo&s;e of poi&s;oning. Of the mineral poi&s;ons ar&s;enic is mo&s;t frequently admini&s;tered; the action of all mineral poi|&s;ons is immediately on the &s;tomach; which it throws into violent &s;pa&s;ms, induces in|ce&s;&s;ant vomiting, pain, hiccough, di&s;tention of the abdomen, and in &s;ome ca&s;es which I have &s;een, it appeared as if drawn in to|wards the back, frequent deliquium, cold &s;weats, convul&s;ions and death; the body turns &s;uddenly putrid, becomes horridly inflated; the head, tongue, fauces, mon|&s;trou&s;ly &s;welled and black; the whole car|ca&s;e emits the mo&s;t putrid &s;tench, and the &s;carf-&s;kin peels off on touching it. On view|ing the &s;tomach, it appears inflated, often inflamed with gangrenous &s;pots, or rather &s;uffu&s;ions, here and there &s;pread over its &s;urface, and the blood ve&s;&s;els di&s;tended. When opened, the villous coat has all the appearance of having &s;uffered great inflam|mation: often an e&s;char is ob&s;erved, en|circled by an inflammatory ring: this has been deemed characteri&s;tic of the action of ar&s;enic; but, I know to a certainty, that it is not. An inver&s;ion of the inte&s;tinal canal is al&s;o frequently &s;een. Having fini&s;hed the anatomical in&s;pection of tho&s;e parts, we
<PB N="15" REF="19">next proceed chemically to examine the contents of the &s;tomach: I am convinced that many erroneous and fatal opinions have been drawn in tho&s;e ca&s;es from the mo&s;t bungling and inaccurate proce&s;&s;es: the mo&s;t deci&s;ive methods of a&s;certaining the exi&s;tence of ar&s;enic in the contents, is by expo&s;ing the detached &s;ub&s;tance we deem to be ar&s;enic to the effects of fire, when an aliaceous &s;mell will be emitted; to make the experiment u&s;ually tried on copper, which it turns white; or to precipitate it by a preparation of &s;ulphur. If we but for a moment con&s;ider the circum&s;tances that happen previous to death, the ince&s;&s;ant vomitings, con&s;tant dilution, and often &s;mall quantity of the poi&s;on taken in, it will not be &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould elude all chemical inve&s;tigation, and that the whole of the poi&s;on may be frequently ejected &s;oon after it has been received, al|though its deleterious effects continue. Be|&s;ides, few bodies are opened until twelve or twenty-four hours after death; and at tho&s;e periods very important changes rapidly take place; &s;o that to detach ar&s;enic from all adventitious &s;ub&s;tances (under tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances) is more to be wi&s;hed for than expected, and all mineral poi&s;ons, as to their immediate action, if given in &s;uch

<P>I ATTENDED two healthy men that were poi&s;oned by drinking claret made up with &s;ugar of lead&mdash;a frequent practice in cor|recting &s;our wine; they both died in the cour&s;e of forty eight hours after; and it was impo&s;&s;ible, either from the &s;ymptoms that preceded death, or the appearances found on di&s;&s;ection, to determine what kind of mineral poi&s;on had been admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>VEGETABLE poi&s;ons, particularly the laurel, may be ranked among the mo&s;t pow|erful; their action &s;eems more immediately to engage the nervous &s;y&s;tem, than locally to affect the &s;tomach; therefore con|vul&s;ions, epilep&s;y, apoplexy, and death, &s;oon &s;ucceed: nor can the effects, particu|larly of the laurel, be ob&s;erved, on in&s;pect|ing the &s;tomach and alimentary canal.&mdash; Any opinion founded on the &s;mell of the contents, or giving them to a dog di&s;gui&s;ed in food, I con&s;ider of no weight in deciding on &s;o important a que&s;tion. I will ju&s;t re|mark, that where death has in a few hours followed the admini&s;tration of poi&s;on, if mineral, the excitement is fir&s;t local; &s;oon after the nervous &s;y&s;tem becomes affected:
<PB N="17" REF="23">if vegetable, the nervous &s;y&s;tem becomes at once engaged, and no characteri&s;tic local ef|fect can be perceived on di&s;&s;ection. In either ca&s;e death &s;eems to me to be more immedi|ately produced by pain, the fatigue of vomit|ing, convul&s;ions, and, in &s;hort, general &s;ym|pathy, than from any organic injury.</P>
<P>I HAVE been frequently called on in ca&s;es of death, where poi&s;on was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been given; and after the mo&s;t accurate anatomical inve&s;tigation, I never could de|cide, the appearances were &s;o ambiguous. Should this appear extraordinary, it ought to be remembered that in all ca&s;es of &s;udden death, (particularly if the decea&s;ed was of a full habit), the body &s;wells, and &s;uddenly turns putrid: although this event may in a &s;horter time take place, and in a more exten|&s;ive way, where poi&s;on has been admini&s;|tered; yet this is a matter involved in &s;o much doubt, and depends &s;o much on con|tingency ari&s;ing from &s;ea&s;on, &s;ituation, and various other circum&s;tances, as to render it of little weight in deciding on &s;o important a point.</P>
<P>POISONS of all kinds induce &s;udden pu|trefaction, and &s;o do &s;pirits, when drank to &s;uch exce&s;s as to cau&s;e death.&mdash;I remem|ber the ca&s;e of a woman accu&s;tomed to drink
<PB N="18" REF="24">&s;pirits in &s;uch quantities as to be almo&s;t continually drunk: this woman was found dead in her room; I was called a few hours after; &s;he was then &s;o putrid that I &s;melt her from below &s;tairs. On examining the body, it was horridly inflated, bur&s;ting with putrefaction, the &s;carf &s;kin peeled off with the &s;lighte&s;t touch. On opening the &s;tomach, an aliaceous &s;mell, or that of garlic, was ex|tremely perceptible; this convinced a gentle|man pre&s;ent, that ar&s;enic had been admini&s;|tered. It was in vain I informed him that ar&s;enic, unle&s;s expo&s;ed to the action of fire, was inodorous: the family became alarmed, doubt and terror &s;eized them; Providence directed me to a clo&s;er examination, and I found a box of a&s;afoetida pills (which &s;he u&s;ually took from time to time) in the win|dow. This immediately &s;o &s;truck me, that I turned out the contents of the &s;tomach into a ba&s;on, and found a pill undi&s;&s;olved. I need not mention from what impending mi|&s;ery a hu&s;band (who was the per&s;on &s;u&s;|pected of having poi&s;oned her) was &s;aved.</P>
<P>AS to the appearances of inflammation and gangrene, all who are conver&s;ant in di&s;|&s;ections, know that they indicate the com|mencement of putrefaction as frequently as the effects of di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;There is hardly a &s;tomach of tho&s;e who die of &s;hort illne&s;s, that
<PB N="19" REF="25">does not pre&s;ent &s;uffu&s;ed &s;pots, the ga&s;tric juice often acts on the &s;tomach as a &s;olvent af|ter death, and from this cau&s;e the &s;tomach has been found eroded in different parts, as if acted on by &s;ome of the mineral poi&s;ons, which by the ignorant may be taken for morbid ap|pearances; I therefore am decidedly of opini|on, that unle&s;s ar&s;enic is found actually in the &s;tomach, all the other marks of its having been admini&s;tered, are extremely equivocal, and &s;hould be of no weight in determining on a point of &s;o much con&s;equence, and where (&s;hould any mi&s;take ari&s;e) the accu&s;ed per&s;on may &s;uffer an ignominious death.</P>
<P>JURIES therefore in all ca&s;es of &s;u&s;pected poi&s;on, in forming their opinion, &s;hould at|tend more to the other circum&s;tances that may occur in the cour&s;e of the trial, than to the report of the &s;urgeon; all medical opini|ons in tho&s;e ca&s;es being more frequently founded on mere conjectures, than real facts, are little to be relied on.</P>
<P>THE next circum&s;tance in which the opi|nion of a &s;urgeon is u&s;ually demanded, is, the ca&s;e of &s;uppo&s;ed infanticide.</P>
<P>I HONOUR the memory of the late Doctor Hunter, for a paper which he publi&s;hed in the &s;ixth volume of the London Medical Ob|&s;ervations,
<PB N="20" REF="26">on this &s;ubject; it is replete with anatomical di&s;crimination, directed to the mo&s;t humane purpo&s;es. He is of opinion (and that founded on long experience and an intimate knowledge of the feelings of the &s;ex, in the mo&s;t critical and trying moments) that infanticide is rarely a premeditated act. &mdash;In fact, women who are pregnant, with|out daring to avow their &s;ituation, are gene|rally poor, deluded, credulous creatures, abandoned by the objects of their affection and cau&s;e of their misfortune, often left to &s;truggle with neglect, poverty, and di&s;ea&s;e. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, they retire to &s;ome &s;olitary place when in labour, and abandon them&s;elves, in de&s;pair to the event, without &s;eeking any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Delivery in tho&s;e circum&s;tances is frequently attended with haemorrhage either during the time, or immediately after; the placenta is detached, it frequently lies half in the vagina and os uteri, for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a deli|quium is frequently induced, from terror and lo&s;s of blood; and when the unfortunate woman recovers, perhaps &s;he finds the child dead; and in this &s;ituation, &s;urely her con|cealing the cau&s;e of her &s;hame is an impul&s;e of nature, and &s;hould not be adduced as a proof of guilt: Yet this very circum&s;tance (without making any allowance for the &s;tate of mind in tho&s;e moments of terror and &s;hame) gives ri&s;e to &s;u&s;picion, and often leads to an
<PB N="21" REF="27">enquiry, that in the event, has con&s;igned many an innocent woman to an ignominious death. If the appearances of poi&s;on are found extremely equivocal on di&s;&s;ection, tho&s;e of infanticide are &s;till more &s;o; no judgment ab&s;tracted from evident external injury, ought to have the lea&s;t weight; the &s;uffu&s;ed and bloated look of a child in tho&s;e ca&s;es, is rather characteri&s;tic of its being &s;till|born, particularly if occurring after a tedious or difficult labour.&mdash;The experiments gene|rally tried on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, in order to a&s;|certain whether the child was born alive or not, are all made on the lungs: it is con|cluded, if they float on being thrown into water, that the child came into the world alive; if they &s;ink, that it was born dead: no appearances are le&s;s to be relied on. Pu|trefaction will occa&s;ion the lungs to be &s;pe|cifically lighter than water, and cau&s;e them to &s;wim on the &s;urface although they never had been inflated, and by inflammati|on they may become den&s;e, and &s;ink to the bottom, although the child had breathed; be&s;ides, the child may have partially or ju&s;t breathed, and expired on being born.&mdash;In &s;hort, all &s;uch appearances &s;o much depend on a variety of contingent circum&s;tances, as render them of little importance in determin|ing in ca&s;es of &s;u&s;pected infanticide.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="28">
<P>HAVING anatomically in&s;pected the body, the young &s;urgeon &s;hould retire, and recon|&s;ider the ca&s;e before he makes his report: his character is at &s;take, as well as the ac|cu&s;ed per&s;on's life; both, by imprudence, may be irretrievably lo&s;t. In delivering his opinion, or explaining the cau&s;e of death, the &s;urgeon's narrative &s;hould be &s;imple and candid; let him u&s;e as few technical terms as po&s;&s;ible, both for the better information of the jury, and to avoid giving a lawyer an opportunity of embarra&s;&s;ing him.</P>
<P>AS, ab&s;tracted from wounds, fractures, and other external injuries, the cau&s;es of death are generally equivocal; wherever the &s;urgeon cannot a&s;certain them beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, he &s;hould decide in favour of the accu&s;ed: better ninety and nine guilty &s;hould e&s;cape puni&s;hment than one innocent per&s;on &s;uffer.</P>
<P>THE remaining points to be con&s;idered are the manner of making reports, and the attendance on inque&s;ts.</P>
<P>NO people &s;uffer more from malicious pro&s;ecutions than tho&s;e of the lower order in Ireland; every di&s;pute is with them generally terminated <HI>fu&s;tibus et gladiis;</HI> and
<PB N="23" REF="29">he who has got the wor&s;t of the battle, &s;wears again&s;t the victorious party: two motives &s;eem principally to induce them &s;o uniformly to have recour&s;e to law for re|dre&s;s; the fir&s;t is re&s;entment, the next money; and in the pur&s;uit of both, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the flagrant in&s;tances of perjury every day exhibited in our Crown Offices.&mdash;I never attended a trial of this kind that I was not &s;hocked at the contra|dictory a&s;&s;ertions of both parties, many of which I knew, at the in&s;tant, to have no foundation in truth: the witne&s;&s;es are gene|rally tutored for the evident purpo&s;e of per|jury previous to the trial, and, in the com|mon language, are ready to <HI>&s;wear any thing</HI> that may be deemed conducive to gaining their &s;uit. The mode of pro&s;ecution is &s;imply as follows:&mdash;When a man has re|ceived a wound, or any other injury, he immediately goes to a magi&s;trate and lodges examinations again&s;t the per&s;on from whom he received it, and &s;wears he is under the care of a &s;urgeon, and his life is in danger; the magi&s;trate grants a warrant for appre|hending the offending party, and, if taken, he is immediately committed to goal.&mdash; Now, all this is generally done without much enquiry whether the allegations are well-founded or not.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="30">
<P>TO be committed to goal is, in it&s;elf, I conceive, a very great puni&s;hment, and I am convinced has been the means of corrupt|ing many an innocent man; for &s;hame and character, tho&s;e barriers again&s;t vice, are at once lo&s;t: the accu&s;ed mu&s;t lie in pri&s;on until bailed out, on the &s;urgeon's report of the per&s;on injured being out of danger. How many hone&s;t innocent men have I known ruined before this report was ob|tained, their families in &s;upporting them in pri&s;on, reduced to beggary, and them|&s;elves, by wicked a&s;&s;ociation, the effects of de&s;pair, the lo&s;s of character, become drunken, idle, and profligate during the remainder of their lives.</P>
<P>THERE is hardly a man in &s;ociety that may not innocently become the unfortu|nate victim of a malicious pro&s;ecution. To convince the mo&s;t incredulous, and to &s;hew to what extent &s;uch things are &s;ometimes carried, I will, out of many in&s;tances, pro|duce one.</P>
<P>A CLERGYMAN of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church hearing his wife and &s;ervant-maid di&s;put|ing in the kitchen about &s;ome trivial mat|ter, went down and only interfered &s;o far as to repel &s;ome rudene&s;s offered by the girl to her mi&s;tre&s;s, by pu&s;hing the &s;ervant one
<PB N="25" REF="31">&s;ide. She either accidentally, or on purpo&s;e, fell again&s;t the dre&s;&s;er, and received a &s;light contu&s;ion over the eye, of no &s;ort of con&s;e|quence; &s;he immediately went up &s;tairs, &s;tood at the &s;treet door, told the people pa&s;&s;ing by &s;he had been almo&s;t murdered by her ma&s;ter; and to confirm this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;he immediately dropped into an apparently &s;trong epileptic fit. She was then carried as one expiring to an ho&s;pital, and without far|ther inquiry the unfortunate clergyman and his wife, were both dragged to Newgate. The indignation of the populace was at &s;uch an height, that the windows of his hou&s;e were broken, and the furniture thrown out into the &s;treet. In the evening the account of this dreadful murder was cried about the &s;treets by the news-hawkers. The next day this woman was removed out of the ho&s;pital to private lodgings, where &s;he continued to be attended by &s;ome of the faculty for ten or twelve days, during which time &s;he never could be got to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;igns of &s;en&s;e or recollection, but &s;eemed to be (particularly when examined) violently agitated and convul&s;ed. I was at this time called into con&s;ultation, and on examining her rather unexpectedly, I was at once convinced &s;he laboured under no real complaint, and that &s;he was a vile im|po&s;tor:
<PB N="26" REF="32">There are two objects a medical man &s;hould have in view in tho&s;e inquiries &mdash;to alarm the party by fear of operation, or to rou&s;e them into &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion by abu&s;e: I took the latter method, and with &s;ome har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions told her, I would in&s;tantly &s;end her to Channel-row; &s;he, as one electrified bounced up, and &s;wore I dare not: My bu&s;ine&s;s was now effected; I im|mediately went to the late Sir Samuel Brad|&s;treet, related the whole tran&s;action, and had the clergyman and his wife liberated. On coming back I called to &s;ee in what &s;ituation my patient was, but &s;he, as &s;oon as I had left the hou&s;e, put on her clothes, and decamped without leave.&mdash;It is need|le&s;s to comment on this ca&s;e; I will only add, that the terror and &s;hame, of being &s;o publickly expo&s;ed, made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on this poor man's mind, as brought his life into the mo&s;t imminent danger; and the expences attending his confinement, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;urrounded as he was with a large family, con&s;iderably injured his circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IN order to obviate tho&s;e abu&s;es in our medical juri&s;prudence, magi&s;trates &s;hould not grant a warrant for committing a man to goal on the mere oath of the injured per&s;on, and unle&s;s the attending &s;urgeon
<PB N="27" REF="33">certifies his life to be in danger. When a per&s;on is once committed to goal for an offence of this nature, without a &s;urgeon's report, that the injured party is not in dan|ger of his life, he cannot be admitted to bail. Formerly giving certificates of this kind formed a very lucrative part of the practice of &s;urgeons, for they often, in tho&s;e ca&s;es, with-held making any report until paid their demand for their whole attend|ance. I have known thirty, forty, nay eighty guineas, given, before a report could be obtained. In &s;hort, if the accu&s;ed was rich, or if they thought they could get much money, all parties mu&s;t be &s;atisfied before a report would be thought of.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the di&s;tre&s;s that this iniquitous practice has reduced whole fa|milies to. I have known the poorer people in &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;ell or pawn every nece&s;&s;ary they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in order to get as much money as would &s;atisfy the &s;urgeon, who was generally the principal object, and relea&s;e perhaps a hu&s;band or brother from pri&s;on. During this negociation, it was al|ways thought nece&s;&s;ary that the injured per&s;ons &s;hould keep in bed, and appear ex|tremely ill; and they were generally &s;o well in&s;tructed, and &s;uch good actors, that it re|quired no &s;mall &s;hare of di&s;crimination to detect them, for they would &s;uffer even &s;e|vere
<PB N="28" REF="34">operations, or any thing that was thought nece&s;&s;ary to the carrying on the deception. I have in many of tho&s;e ca&s;es unexpectedly vi&s;ited a fellow and found him eating heartily of beef-&s;teaks, who perhaps two hours before appeared with all the &s;ymptoms of a fractured &s;kull. Out of many in&s;tances I will produce one:&mdash;A man deemed to be rich, gave another a blow with a &s;tick on the head, and cut him: he was the next day &s;worn again&s;t, and lodg|ed in goal; the man was attended by a &s;urgeon long &s;ince dead: another was call|ed: no report could be made, as no terms were offered by the man in goal, that would be accepted. Days and weeks pa&s;&s;ed in this kind of negociation; for although the man was wealthy, he was tenacious: At length a third &s;urgeon was called; he found that the man had originally but a &s;light cut: but that it had been thought nece&s;&s;ary (on account of irregular &s;hiverings which the man &s;aid he had) to &s;calp him: (an opera|tion as then performed attended with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain, and by which the &s;kull was laid bare to near the breadth of half a crown.) No other dangerous circum&s;tance appearing, the con&s;ulted &s;urgeon, fully con|vinced of the impo&s;ition, in order to terrify the man propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be imme|diately trepaned; the patient enquired the
<PB N="29" REF="35">nature of that operation; the other coolly replied, it was only to bore a hole through his &s;kull with an in&s;trument much like a large augre. This was going too far;&mdash; terms were immediately propo&s;ed, and accept|ed: the &s;hiverings cea&s;ed, and the man in goal (after a confinement of &s;ix weeks) was relea&s;ed, at the expence of near five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>THE Royal College of Surgeons early &s;aw tho&s;e flagrant abu&s;es, and have done every thing in their power to counteract them; for by one of their by-laws, no member of the college can demand more than two guineas for a report to a magi&s;trate; and &s;hould he be convicted of making a fal&s;e and corrupt one, he is publickly expelled the college.</P>
<P>THE only point that remains for con&s;i|deration, is, the attendance on inque&s;ts. This has always been deemed a profe&s;&s;ional duty which &s;urgeons owe to public ju&s;tice; and undoubtedly, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, it really is &s;o: however, public motives alone will &s;el|dom induce men to act contrary to their pri|vate intere&s;ts.&mdash;To attend an inque&s;t is, to the &s;urgeon, unprofitable, the lo&s;s of time highly inconvenient, and in the event may be productive of very di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences; for he is bound to appear at the
<PB N="28" REF="36"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="29" REF="37"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="30" REF="38">trial, whence, &s;hould he be ab&s;ent, even on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing profe&s;&s;ional occa&s;ion, he may be heavily fined.&mdash;Tho&s;e are very &s;trong motives for &s;urgeons to endeavour, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid being engaged on &s;uch occa&s;ions. I was my&s;elf fined fifty pounds by the late Judge Robin&s;on, although he had been previou&s;ly informed that I had only ju&s;t quitted the court, on being &s;ent for to a man who&s;e thigh I had amputated in the morn|ing, and who was &s;aid to have had a bleeding from the &s;tump: to this excu&s;e the judge paid not the lea&s;t attention, as, I believe, he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be ill-founded; &s;o impo&s;ed the fine. It is true, I got it taken off next day. But there is &s;omething extremely humiliating and vexatious in the various applications ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be made on tho&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>A SURGEON not long &s;ince had a keeper put on his hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of a green|wax proce&s;s, for non-attendance, although he had not been half an hour ab&s;ent from court; but unfortunately the trial com|menced in the interim. This ca&s;e was ex|tremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, for he was a man &s;ur|rounded with a &s;mall family, and could not po&s;&s;ibly command half the &s;um. The con&s;e|quence was, the keeper remained on his hou&s;e for eight weeks, as the judge who impo&s;ed the fine was ab&s;ent on circuit, and nothing
<PB N="31" REF="39">could be done in the affair until he came back. So after &s;uffering this di&s;grace, and being at more than ten pounds expence, at length the fine was remitted.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e different circum&s;tances are duly con&s;idered, no reflection can ju&s;tly fall on gentlemen of the profe&s;&s;ion, for endea|vouring to avoid an attendance that mu&s;t &s;o materially interfere with their other duties. However there can be no doubt that it is ex|tremely nece&s;&s;ary that inque&s;ts &s;hould be properly attended, and that the wor&s;t con&s;e|quences may ari&s;e, and frequently do, from the want of a good anatomi&s;t and experienced &s;urgeon to a&s;&s;i&s;t on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. It is ab&s;olutely &s;hameful that, in ca&s;es where life and death are at i&s;&s;ue, the jury, in the more important point of the trial, &s;hould have no better direction to form their opinion by, than (perhaps) the evidence of an appren|tice, &s;o that ju&s;tice may be evaded, or inno|cence condemned.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of attending inque&s;ts &s;hould be therefore made a di&s;tinct appointment, or annexed to &s;ome of the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ional e&s;tabli&s;hments: &s;o that in all ca&s;es of &s;up|po&s;ed murder, the in&s;pection of a good ana|tomi&s;t and experienced &s;urgeon, may no longer be a matter of mere contingency.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="40">
<P>BEFORE I conclude tho&s;e general remarks, I reque&s;t the reader will con&s;ider that it ne|ver was my intention to go much into detail. The &s;ubject undoubtedly is important, and required more time and attention than I was able to give it; but, if what I have advanced, will lead to any u&s;eful enquiry, or be the means of detecting ignorance or defeating malice, my views are fully completed.</P>
