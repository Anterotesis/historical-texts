<HEAD>Lues Venerea.</HEAD>
<P>_THOSE who fetch the Origi|nal of this Di&s;temper no far|ther back than the Siege of <HI>Naples</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> 1494, thence calling it the <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ometimes the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t only mean that it received its pre|&s;ent Name there, that it became more common, or that luckily about that Time &s;ome Remedy was found better adapted to its Cure than any before known: For no doubt it reaches in An|tiquity the Fir&s;t Ages; it being irratio|nal either to &s;uppo&s;e a World drowned for their Sins, Strangers to the Vice that contracts it, or that their Wickedne&s;s any more than ours de&s;erved Exemp|tion. No; Providence, we may &s;afely
<PB N="2" REF="5">believe, &s;tamped an immediate Puni&s;h|ment on this, as on all other Intempe|rance and Sin, <HI>ab Origine,</HI> that the Pains and Sufferings &s;ucceeding a vicious Cour&s;e of Life, might, if nothing el&s;e would, re&s;train us to Vertue, and be both a natural and moral Good to us. We find <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> de&s;cribing a Lepro&s;y, <HI>Levit.</HI> 13 and 14, that corre&s;ponds with the Symptoms, and &s;eems to have been a Species of this Di&s;temper; &s;o does the Difficulty of the Cure, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. where it is &s;aid, <HI>The botch and &s;cab of Egypt of which thou can&s;t not be healed:</HI> And tho&s;e many Laws found here relating to a Le|pro&s;y, would &s;uffer a greater Di&s;appoint|ment than &s;eems intended, as well from the Ob&s;tinacy as infrequency of the Di|&s;temper, if applied only to what we now &s;trictly under&s;tand by that Term: The &s;ame may be &s;aid of many Ancient Phy|&s;ical Authors, who with the like or grea|ter Plainne&s;s have de&s;cribed the Symp|toms, tho' not under the modern Titles.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this Subject I pro|po&s;e to &s;et forth the Nature and Manner of In&s;ection in all tho&s;e Symptoms com|monly under&s;tood by a Clap, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrhea, Chancre, Phymo&s;is, &amp;c.</HI> and then exhibit a Method of Cure; mentioning
<PB N="3" REF="6">the Symptoms occa&s;ionally under either Head, as they &s;erve to enlighten each o|ther: And <HI>First</HI> of the <HI>Gonorrhaea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> is benign or malign: The fir&s;t &s;ort is an Emi&s;&s;ion of Humour from the <HI>Glandulae pro&s;tatae,</HI> a Weakne&s;s only, and commonly proceeding from great Strains, and where the natural Strength has been too far exerted in any &s;ort, whether by Labour or Venereal Plea|&s;ures; it has its Symptoms as well as Proce&s;s of Cure very different from the malignant, which at pre&s;ent I &s;hall make the only Subject of my Enquiry, and that under two Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. By &s;hewing how either Sex be|comes infected. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. A Cure for that Infection.</P>
<P>And 1st. Of the Woman: Her I look on mu&s;t be primarily and originally Infe|cted, that is <HI>&s;ine amplexu infecto,</HI> to intro|duce the being of this Di&s;temper in the World: For let a Man corre&s;pond with what Variety he plea&s;es (provided they are &s;ound) he receives no Malignancy, which could it be &s;o with her, I cannot &s;ee why we ever &s;hould thus unhappily have had its Knowledge; but Experience too fatally contradicting this, is a Con|viction, that Coition with Numbers has
<PB N="4" REF="7">fir&s;t of all, and probably does &s;till, at &s;ome times effect the &s;ame, as at other times Communication with an infected Per&s;on; and this I &s;hall endeavour to make out in a few Words.</P>
<P>Such who &s;ay the promi&s;cuous Mixture of different Sperms excites a Ferment, which in a little Time throws off &s;uch an Ex&s;pumation as we call a Running, do agree that Numbers (tho' &s;ound) car|ry Infection, we only differ in the Man|ner they accompli&s;h it, which I rather &s;uppo&s;e to be thus: When the Venereal Appetite is jaded with the too intempe|rate Efforts of &s;everal Men, it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e Parts to &s;uffer the continued Frictions made there (as common Women do) without excori|ating and fretting the Membranes of the Vagina; and &s;uch Excoriations, how &s;mall &s;oever in the beginning, meeting with an ill Habit of Body, together with the natural Incale&s;cence and Moi&s;ture of the Parts, will &s;oon degenerate to an Ul|cer; which Ulcer will be the Di&s;temper: And perhaps herein lies the Difference be|tween a <HI>Fluor Albus</HI> and <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> (when thus contracted) that the one is a Weak|ne&s;s from too frequent Irritations made there, and the other be&s;ides that extrin&s;i|cal
<PB N="5" REF="8">Accident, has an ill Habit of Body joined, that induces Intemperies.</P>
<P>What I think gives Credit to this Opi|nion is the Cu&s;toms of the Jewi&s;h, Maho|metan, and many other Countries, who allow a Plurality of Wives, and an unli|mited Number of Concubines, re&s;train|ing their Sex at the &s;ame time to one: For this, tho' an inferiour Motive of the Law, argues the World to have previou&s;|ly experienced &s;uch a Liberty in them more de&s;tructive of Health and a &s;ound Con&s;titution than in us. Among other Creatures there is an In&s;tinct an&s;wering &s;uch a Purpo&s;e of the Law whereby the Females are <HI>provoked only at certain Sea|&s;ons to Propagation,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;tain after Con|ception;</HI> Nature <HI>intimating by it a Le&s;&s;on of Cha&s;tity to the Fair; that it &s;hould be their</HI> peculiar <HI>as well as most</HI> ornamental <HI>Vertue.</HI></P>
<P>Again&s;t it, I can form to my &s;elf only two Objections: Fir&s;t, That it may be alleged the Activity of &s;ome Men this Way, might prejudice a weak Woman the &s;ame as a Number: And Secondly, it may be asked how an Ulcer, <HI>in Va|gina,</HI> can acquire Malignity enough to communicate Infection on Coition, when the greate&s;t Degree of Virulen|cy
<PB N="6" REF="9">in another Ulcer produces no &s;uch Effect?</P>
<P>But, to the&s;e it may be an&s;wered, That the Strength and Activity of any two in Health will &s;eldom be found &s;o di&s;pro|portionate as to become hurtful, when it is; the Di&s;order en&s;uing can be no more than a <HI>Fluor Albus,</HI> or a Weak|ne&s;s without Malignity. And as to the other; why an Ulcer here &s;hould &s;ooner impart its Mi&s;chief than any other? Is, that the Parts concerned are in all Re&s;pects more commodious for giving and receiving any Injury, and that the Heat rai&s;ed and excited by Lu&s;t gives a Force and Activity to the Salts gene|rated under the Corruption; whereas a|ny other Ulcer, tho' never &s;o virulent, cannot emit Effluvia's in &s;uch Force or Numbers, nor to Parts &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of their Reception; but if they had tho&s;e Advantages, it is likely their Effects would be equal, many ill Con&s;equences following from an Ulcer with Virulency in any Part incautiou&s;ly dry'd up.</P>
<P>That Lu&s;t al&s;o is a very nece&s;&s;ary Ad|junct for communicating Infection, and giving Force to tho&s;e virulent Mia&s;ms that are as it were darted by it from her, we judge by that particular Power and
<PB N="7" REF="10">Influence, Imagination is found to have in the Commotion of the&s;e Parts: In this Ca&s;e it is &s;o much, that many infe|cted Women avoid hurting their Hu&s;|bands principally on the Moderation and Coolne&s;s of their Enjoyments, whereas a Stranger inciting more inten&s;e and vi|gorous De&s;ires as &s;eldom e&s;capes. The &s;ame may be &s;aid where two or three, with weaker or &s;tronger Inclinations, lie with one and the &s;ame infected Wo|man, that one perhaps &s;hall be catch'd, and the others come off unhurt, chiefly as the Fancy on either &s;ide is brisk and lively, inclin'd or di&s;inclin'd.</P>
<P>Venereal Contact &s;eems of &s;uch Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for communicating Infection, that with me it is a very unlikely thing for Venereal Matter ever to do it without, tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;erted the contrary of this have done it in &s;uch improbable In|&s;tances, which whoever can a&s;&s;ent to, will be very unrea&s;onable if they deny their Acquie&s;cence in what I have ad|vanced of Numbers. For In&s;tance:</P>
<P>The <HI>Practical Scheme</HI> (Page 4.) &s;ays, It is not always nece&s;&s;ary a Woman be clapp'd to give it a Man, but that he may take off all the virulent Matter left in the Pa&s;&s;age by a preceding Gallant,
<PB N="8" REF="11">and &s;he remain perfectly well; or that &s;he may give it him by only taking the corrupted Matter from her Body in her Hand and wetting his Privities.</P>
<P>And others relate its highe&s;t Degene|racy, or a Pox, to be Contagious by wearing the Clothes, Lying, or Cohabi|ting with an infected Per&s;on; e&s;pecially if we &s;uppo&s;e it of that Stage of the Di|&s;temper wherein the Body becomes over|&s;pread with Cutaneous Eruptions and Blotches.</P>
<P>There are but Two Ways in this latter Ca&s;e (for the former I have no Notion of) whereby Contagion can be &s;uppo|&s;ed to pa&s;s, and that is by their throwing off a greater Quantity of noxious and virulent Effluvia, able to contaminate where they reach, or el&s;e, (like what is related in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions concerning Contagion in the Itch) <HI>A|nimalculae,</HI> are bred in tho&s;e Globules, di&s;per&s;ed about the Skin, which making their Way through, &s;hift from Place to Place, and &s;o carry Infection, they liv|ing (&s;ays the Relation) two or three Days when from the Body.</P>
<P>But how well the&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;ignata</HI> may re|&s;olve other contagious Di&s;tempers, they will here be found but light in the Bal|lance,
<PB N="9" REF="12">Fact baffles Philo&s;ophy, and if all tho&s;e who have &s;uffered this Way are like what have fallen to my Share, there is not one who could &s;tand by any other Pretence than Coition: Whence we ought to account the Di&s;temper a Mark of Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and a pre&s;ent bodily Correction for our Sin, that the Sen&s;e of our own Intere&s;t, might work on us, and bring us back to Temperance and Vertue.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>How a Man becomes infected.</HEAD>
<P>WOmen we have adjudged &s;ome|times to become infected by the Admi&s;&s;ion of Numbers, tho' &s;ound and healthful; but a Man cannot by the &s;ame Means, becau&s;e among other Rea|&s;ons there is this invincible one, That Nature is not able to &s;upport the Repeti|tions of tho&s;e Acts to &s;uch a Multiplicity, or in &s;uch Mea&s;ure as with her who is pa&s;&s;ive; but could that be, I believe al&s;o he might &s;o contract it: In&s;atiable and impotent Efforts, or too painful Enjoy|ments through the Straitne&s;s of the <HI>Vagina,</HI> frequently di&s;covers &s;omething like this, in what we call <HI>&s;imple Gonor|rhaea's</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13">and <HI>Chri&s;tallins,</HI> which perhaps Time and an ill Habit would change, and make to become virulent, did not Pain or the Debility of Nature prevent a further U&s;e of the Cau&s;e that fir&s;t produced them, and hinder our Actions from keeping Pace with the Viciou&s;ne&s;s of our Wills and Inclinations. For this Rea&s;on therefore Venereal Symptoms thus contracted, never &s;ettle or terminate in a Pox; and I am apt to think all Ma|lignity that does &s;o to him, or is contagi|ous, <HI>Mu&s;t always be from an infected Per&s;on, and always by Coition:</HI> For a clearer Un|der&s;tanding of which, and <HI>the Manner of Communication,</HI> I &s;hall <HI>Cite</HI> Two or Three <HI>Celebrated Opinions about it,</HI> and then <HI>&s;ub|&s;cribe my own.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> &s;ays, <HI>It's Conveyance is by the Ela&s;ticity of the Air, thru&s;ting the Morbifick Matter into the Excretory Ducts of the Pro|&s;latae, which are empty on Coition; and that a &s;imple</HI> Gonorrhaea <HI>is nothing, but a Corro|&s;ion of the Spongious Borders of tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els terminating in the Urethra.</HI></P>
<P>Some think, <HI>a Gonorrhaea to be the Effect of a Fermentation made between the Infectious Liquor, and that of the</HI> Pro&s;tatae, <HI>and &s;o with|out Corro&s;ion an Efflux thrown off like Ye&s;t from Beer.</HI></P>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<P>La&s;tly, Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> &s;uppo&s;es <HI>a Gonor|rhaea to be the encrca&s;e of that Liquor that is di&s;charged by the Excretory Glands of the U|rethra, and done by the Venereal Stimulus, in the &s;ame manner as</HI> Cantharides <HI>apply'd would do; the Quantity of Matter di&s;charg'd being in proportion to the Stimulating Force they are affected with: And this</HI> Stimulus (he &s;ays) <HI>encrea&s;ing its Acrimony, does in Proce&s;s of time, make Ulcers in the</HI> Urethra. This he farther oppo&s;es to Dr. <HI>Keil</HI>'s Opi|nion, by &s;aying, the <HI>Urethra</HI> will admit very little, and that there is no <HI>Mu&s;cle, Membrane,</HI> or <HI>Machine</HI> alleged to help it for ward.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Opinions, be&s;ides their Op|po&s;ition to one another, are deficient in carrying their Aim &s;ingly to a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> without any Attempt at the Cau&s;e of a <HI>Chancre, Chordee,</HI> or <HI>Phymo&s;is,</HI> which Men often become infected with, without a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> I &s;hall therefore begin my Enquiry here, being a&s;&s;ured that they at lea&s;t want another and different Ex|plication, which perhaps when found, will facilitate al&s;o our Search in a <HI>Go|norrhaea;</HI> and if I am right in my Con|jecture, They ari&s;e from the Strength, Activity, and Solidity of the Salts hid with the Corruption, which being di|&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="12" REF="15">about the <HI>Vagina,</HI> are volatiliz'd and made fitter for Communication by the Heat of Lu&s;t, and received by the enlarged Pores of the <HI>Penis,</HI> where, by their Pointedne&s;s, they &s;hortly effect an Ero&s;ion.</P>
<P>The manner of this Imbibing or Suc|tion on the Man's &s;ide, is not ab&s;urdly ac|counted for by the general Relaxation that attends all &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, of which Coition is perhaps the greate&s;t: Now, as it mo&s;t exqui&s;itely affects us, the Parts are relaxed and made more ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of any Venom to be tran&s;|mitted, and that again from her becomes enabled to in&s;inuate and e&s;cape through the Pores by the Pungency of their Salts, and Power they are darted with; and if the Degree of Relaxation in any Part be in Proportion to the Plea&s;ure, (as in the agreeable Objects of any other Sen&s;e, it is, where tho' &s;ome Degree of it re|&s;ults to the whole Man, yet &s;omething remains peculiar to the Sen&s;e of which it is an Object) then the In&s;truments of Generation, by being mo&s;t relaxed, will be al&s;o mo&s;t fitted on that Account for the Reception of morbifick Matter.</P>
<P>Hence the Genital Parts &s;hould always &s;uffer fir&s;t, and amorous Men &s;oone&s;t.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<P>And if virulent Matter, thus externally lodged, can act like Cantharides, and produce a <HI>Chancre, Chordee,</HI> or <HI>Phymo&s;is,</HI> then I believe we may al&s;o, without any repugnancy to Rea&s;on, think this out|ward Application of it in Coition &s;uffi|cient to produce a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> The Diffi|culty again&s;t it being only how this Taint can be tran&s;mitted hence to the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> which will not be &s;o hard to Imagine, if we con&s;ider what has been already &s;aid of the Power impelling, and the Aptitude to receive. We find all Parts of the Body Porous, and by many Experiments re|ceptive of any proper Matter incumbent on them, conveying and mixing a Por|tion with the Humours of the Body, as in Bathing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In all Tran&s;lations of Tumours, whe|ther by Revul&s;ion or Derivation, this Sympathy and Communication of Parts is evident, and particularly in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, where, on an improper handling, the Virulency will revert into the Blood, and produce all the Symptoms of a <HI>Pox,</HI> and indeed all outward Applications to any Malady deeper than the Skin (without this) would be impertinent: Why then &s;hould it be thought &s;o extra|ordinary for infectious Matter arm'd with
<PB N="14" REF="17">other Properties than bare Fluidity, to affect the&s;e Glandules at &s;o &s;mall a Di|&s;tance? Since it mu&s;t be acknowledged the &s;everal Parts of a Member have a much ea&s;ier Communication with them|&s;elves than with the whole, as we often &s;ee in the quick and ready Tran&s;lation of a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> to the Groin and Te&s;ti|cles, <HI>&amp; Vice Ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The only remaining Objection to this Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion by the Pores is, that the greate&s;t Corro&s;ions at the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Prae|putium</HI> are rarely attended with a <HI>Gonor|rhaea,</HI> whereas were &s;uch Corro&s;ions thus effected, as it would be an Argument of a &s;tronger Infection, and the Corro&s;ive|ne&s;s of that Venereal Matter to be grea|ter, it &s;hould as &s;eldom mi&s;s. This &s;eems to be from the Contraction, Pains and Swelling that attend tho&s;e Ulcers, whereby the Pa&s;&s;ages to the <HI>Pro&s;tatae</HI> are &s;traitned and ob&s;tructed; but a &s;lighter Degree, creating no &s;uch Impediments, ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;es, and is &s;u&s;&s;icient to propel that Humour from the Glands which in a le&s;s Proportion is their Nature and Office. From hence we may learn a <HI>Go|norrhaea</HI> to be the milde&s;t Species of In|fection.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<P>If any one &s;hould yet object and think the <HI>Mucous Glands</HI> of the <HI>Urethra</HI> more ea&s;ily reached than the <HI>Pro&s;tatae,</HI> and &s;o to be the <HI>Seat</HI> of a <HI>Gonorrhaea:</HI> I &s;hall no further in&s;i&s;t, but only remark to the Favourers of &s;uch an Opinion, That a Running is not produced by an Ulce|ration or Corro&s;ion of the <HI>O&s;tiolae</HI> of the Glands terminating there, for &s;uch would be an irreparable Lo&s;s, and is the very Cau&s;e of &s;ome <HI>Gleets,</HI> being incu|rable; but it is rather from the Con&s;titu|ting Ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e Glands being rendred weak and flaccid, that were before vi|grous and ela&s;tick, parting ea&s;ily (for that rea&s;on) with their Contents.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Cure of this Di&s;temper:</HI> And Fir&s;t its <HI>De&s;cription.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>AVirulent Gonorrhaea</HI> or <HI>CLAP,</HI> is <HI>the Emi&s;&s;ion of infectious Matter from the corroded Glandulae Pro&s;tatae,</HI> or <HI>tho&s;e of the Urethra,</HI> accompanied with a DISURIA; or in other Words, <HI>the involuntary Flowing of Matter through the Urethra,</HI> with <HI>Pain, Inflammation</HI> and <HI>Heat of Urine;</HI> The&s;e are its <HI>Patho|gnomick Signs,</HI> and the Degree they are in, with Re&s;pect to Con&s;i&s;tence and Colour in the <HI>Running</HI> (as <HI>Yellow, Green,</HI> or the like) or <HI>Pain in Water,</HI> are what we may take the Mea&s;ure of Virulency from, and will be found more or le&s;s in different
<PB N="17" REF="20">Subjects, according to the Malignity of the infected Per&s;on, and Con&s;titution of the Receiver.</P>
<P>A <HI>Di&s;uria</HI> is a Nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the <HI>Running,</HI> it being a Pain from the <HI>Acriminious Salts</HI> of Urine wa&s;ting thro' the Parts which that has excoriated.</P>
<P>The Cure I &s;hall lay down under the&s;e two Intentions:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To conquer and carry off the Malignancy, and</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To heal and &s;trengthen the Debilitated Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> only is able to an&s;wer our fir&s;t Intention, and effectually to &s;ubdue the Poi&s;on of this Di&s;temper: The Rea&s;on why it has a Power beyond other Medi|cines for this purpo&s;e, is its <HI>Gravity,</HI> and becau&s;e its con&s;tituent Parts are extreme &s;mall, &s;mooth and &s;phaerical: The latter Qualification fits them for an admittance into the &s;malle&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages (even tho&s;e al|mo&s;t indi&s;cernible ones of the Glands) and its weight breaks all Coagulations, and fits the Morbifick Matter for natural Se|cretions. And whatever &s;lights &s;ome may put on this common Road of proceeding; yet, till better convinced in the Vertues of the &s;everal applauded <HI>Specificks</HI> that have appeared abroad in the World, I
<PB N="18" REF="21">take leave to defend it, as a <HI>Safe Practice:</HI> For altho' a tedious, or an ill Cure, may now and then happen, it is not ju&s;tly &s;o much a Charge on the Medicine, as the Method; when we leave off too &s;oon, or continue it with Purges too long, a Practice equally Mi&s;chievous. But more of this by and by.</P>
<P>I am &s;urprized, that every body, by their Practice, &s;hould allow <HI>Mercury</HI> to be the only Foundation and Retreat for Cure, in the la&s;t and &s;tubborne&s;t Stage of this Di&s;temper, a <HI>Pox,</HI> and yet deny its Ver|tues in a milder Sea&s;on. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, there are too often &s;een many ill Effects from this Mineral; and on a &s;eri|ous Reflection, I cannot but think, mo&s;t of tho&s;e deplorable Objects found in Ho&s;pitals, or el&s;ewhere, who&s;e ruined Con&s;titutions are attributed to the <HI>Lues,</HI> to be with more Truth and Ju&s;tice, a&s;cri|bed to <HI>Mercury;</HI> but then this is not the <HI>U&s;e,</HI> but <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of it; an unskilful Ma|nagement often precipitating Patients, (and that in a &s;hort time) into &s;uch mi&s;e|rable Circum&s;tances, as the Di&s;temper, left to it &s;elf, could not in Years (if ever) have produc'd: From this Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion many take a handle to recommend their
<PB N="19" REF="22">infallible <HI>No&s;trums,</HI> which when good for any thing &s;till have this for their Ba&s;is.</P>
<P>The Ingenuity of making <HI>Mercury Spe|cifical,</HI> will lie in the Mea&s;ure and Manner of Admini&s;tration; that it &s;uit &s;uch De|grees of Infection, and &s;uch Con&s;tituti|ons; a Point wherein one Man will excel another, according to their different Ca|pacities, and Opportunities of Experi|ment: All other ways are &s;upported by nothing but a <HI>Bra&s;s Front.</HI> The many &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s Attempts of tho&s;e who publick|ly invite Men to <HI>Safe and Speedy Cures,</HI> have pretty well expo&s;ed their Credit; and People &s;ee it to be nothing but a Compe|tition in Cunning, who &s;hall betray with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, without the lea&s;t Candour, or regard to the Promi&s;es they make: nor is it a &s;mall Di&s;paragement to <HI>Arcana</HI>'s here, that they are generally lodg'd with the Illiterate. I &s;hall further &s;trengthen this Argument for <HI>Mercury,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to other Specificks, by a &s;hort Excur&s;ion on the <HI>Practical Scheme;</HI> becau&s;e it has made the loude&s;t Noi&s;e of late, and has been Famous, if not for attracting Poi|&s;on, yet for attracting the Pence, <HI>Popu|lus vult decipi.</HI></P>

<P>I T. H. <HI>of <GAP DESC="blank"> having been for many Months afflicted with a Swelling in my Belly, Gripings, great Pains in my Limbs, and in a weak and langui&s;hing Condition, for which I had been a long while under the Pre|&s;criptions of &s;everal eminent Phy&s;icians, but to &s;uch purpo&s;e, that I was reduced even to Death's Door: At la&s;t, in a De&s;pondency of Mind, I betook my &s;elf to little Dr.</HI> Le F ... <HI>at the upper end of</HI> Three C...Alley: <HI>On examining my Ca&s;e, and what had been done for it, he &s;hook his Head and &s;aid,</HI> His Bre|thren had very much mi&s;took the Illne&s;s, or el&s;e they would not have bottom'd their Hopes on Medicine Internal or External; That the Planets were more concern'd in this Affair, and had <Q><HI>"United their &s;electe&s;t Influences again&s;t me"</HI></Q>: He bid me be cheery and confident in him, and only

At his Return he told me My Bu&s;ine&s;s was done: That I &s;hould have only one &s;evere Fit of Gripes more, but be perfectly recover'd in a Week. After the Doctor had taken his Leave, my Curio&s;ity led me to enquire of</HI> John, <HI>what had been done at the Fore&s;t, and he told me, all he knew was, that he had &s;een the Doctor bore &s;everal Holes in an old Oak, put my Water in them, and then fill'd them up with Trunnels again, muttering withal &s;ome Words inwardly which he could not un|der&s;tand.

<P>THE other Symptoms of <HI>Virulency</HI> which Denominate a Per&s;on Clapp'd, and that as well without as with a <HI>Gonorrhaea,</HI> are the <HI>Chordee, Phymo&s;is; Paraphymo&s;is, Chancre</HI> and <HI>Bubo.</HI> The&s;e I chu&s;e to &s;peak of &s;eparately in their Cures, becau&s;e they require (be&s;ides an Internal u&s;e of <HI>Mercurials</HI>) Local Applications.</P>
<P>A <HI>Chordee</HI> is a painful Contraction of the <HI>Fraenum</HI> in Erection, cau&s;ed from an Inflammation of that Membrane, which on that accounr being thicker, is con&s;e|quently &s;horter, and mu&s;t excite a Pain when the Erection of the <HI>Penis</HI> &s;tretches it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes another Chor|ding Pain, ari&s;ing from a Sore or Ulcer in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> as often as it comes to be compre&s;s'd by an Erection of the <HI>Penis,</HI> and infers from it, how far within the <HI>U|rethra</HI> the Seat of a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> is: But a|gain&s;t this I object,</P>
<P>That if an inflated <HI>Penis</HI> can &s;o pain|fully compre&s;s this Ulcer on all &s;ides, why
<PB N="33" REF="36">&s;hould not a greater Compre&s;&s;ion with the Hand do it without Erection.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If a <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> be an Ulcer in the <HI>Urethra,</HI> and the Chording Pain a Com|pre&s;&s;ion on that Ulcer, then they mu&s;t be in&s;eparable Companions, and no <HI>Gonorrhaea</HI> could be without it.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I have known the <HI>Chordee</HI> often continue after a Running has been &s;topp'd, which by this Allegation could not be true; &s;uppo&s;ing (as we rea&s;onably may) that where there is no Running there is no Ulcer: The proper local Remedies to it are <HI>Fotus's</HI> of Milk wherein Lilly, Elder, or Mar&s;hmallow-Root has been boiled, and a little <HI>Sacchar.

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Symptons of the <HI>Pox</HI> are cuticu|lar Eruptions, Blotches, Ulcers in the Throat and Palate, Nocturnal Pains of the Head, Shoulders and Shins, <HI>Caries,</HI> Night-Sweats, <HI>Alopecia's,</HI> falling off of the Nails, <HI>Gummas,</HI> Nodes, <HI>Talpas,</HI> Con&s;um|ption and <HI>Mara&s;mus.</HI></P>
<P>How a Clap comes to end in &s;uch contu|macious and intractable Symptoms, may be partly attributed to the Malignancy of the Original Infection, partly to the Pre|di&s;po&s;ition, or ill Habit, whereby the Blood becomes more ea&s;ily receptive of that Ve|nom, but mo&s;t often to an irregular Ma|nagement of Cure, and u&s;e of <HI>Specificks:</HI> It exceeds my De&s;ign, as well as Capacity, to unriddle further the Nature of this Ve|nom, in its &s;everal Appearances under that general Denomination of a <HI>Pox;</HI> hav|ing only intended here the &s;hort <HI>Hi&s;tory of
<PB N="37" REF="40">a Salivation,</HI> by which the mo&s;t of them are effectually to be removed.</P>
<P>A <HI>Salivation</HI> is dangerou&s;ly undertaken with Aged People, with &s;uch as are lean, or dejected thro' Trouble or Misfortunes, or much emaciated; but e&s;pecially with tho&s;e who&s;e Lungs are any way di&s;temper'd, that are Hectical, Phthy|&s;ical and Con&s;umptive, becau&s;e, as this Ha|bit is acquired by the Glandulous Secretions being increas'd, <HI>Mercury</HI> pejorates the Mi&s;|chief, and the more &s;o, if &s;uch Indi&s;po&s;ition has proceeded from a former ill u&s;e of it. Dr. <HI>Moulin</HI> a&s;&s;ures us from Experiments, that <HI>Mercury</HI> is very prejudicial to the Lungs, becau&s;e they want that &s;trong brisk Motion the Mu&s;cles have in other Parts, and by their lax and &s;pongy Texture are extreme|ly unfit for clearing them&s;elves of &s;o trou|ble&s;ome a Gue&s;t: This <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> we daily &s;ee from Per&s;ons often flux'd; who are af|terwards ob&s;erv'd to die of Con&s;umptions, that will not give way to any Cour&s;e of Me|dicine: To which likewi&s;e agrees many in|ter&s;per&s;ed Places in Mr. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Collection of <HI>BAWDY Letters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> ordinarily Operates by a Flux thro' the Salival Glands, and by the parvity of its compounding Parts has a peculiar Ap|titude thereto: The Benefits from it &s;eem as much from the uninterrupted

<P>A <HI>Salivation</HI> is rai&s;ed by <HI>Mercurials</HI> and that either Externally or Internally u&s;ed; Two or three Purges always precede as preparative, and after that if we intend it by Unction, make up the following Ointment, and draw on a pair of Gloves and Stockings after the u&s;e of it, to keep the Linen and Bedcloaths clean.</P>

If there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity to check its A|ctivity, <HI>Flos Sulphuris</HI> is the Medicine.</P>
<P>I account the Salivation well rai&s;ed, if I can make it amount to about two Quarts in a Natural Day, and continue it &s;o for eight or ten; but let the highe&s;t Quantity be what it will, whenever it le&s;&s;ens regn|larly, it &s;ignifies the Mercury to have &s;pent its utmo&s;t Force and Power, and puts us on Con&s;iderations for our Third and la&s;t Branch, <HI>The Recovery, or State of Declen|&s;ion.</HI></P>
