<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s <DATE>Feb. 12, 1748-9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Take the liberty to &s;end you a few ob&s;erva|tions on a particular kind of Scarlet Fever, that hath lately obtained in this place, and &s;ome towns adjacent. The only circum&s;tances, which can entitle this &s;heet to the trouble of your peru&s;al, are the novelty of the &s;ubject, and a careful repre&s;en|tation of facts. Nor &s;hall I obtrude upon you any vague conjectures, or precarious hypothe&s;es, relating to the cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e; much le&s;s take up your valuable moments in the pur&s;uit of u&s;ele&s;s, unmean|ing quotations from other authors.</P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1748. a Scarlet Fe|ver began to appear in this town. At fir&s;t chil|dren only were &s;eized with it; but afterwards it at|tacked adults. The manner of &s;eizure was not al|ways one and the &s;ame. There was &s;ome diver&s;ity
<PB N="4" REF="3">herein; as likewi&s;e in the &s;ymptoms, and &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e. Its period al&s;o was &s;ometimes va|rious in various patients. And as there was a dif|ference in the time, &s;o likewi&s;e there was in the manner of its terminating.</P>
<P>In general, the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms were &s;ickne&s;s, vo|miting and purging. But the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;eemed pretty much confined to children. A &s;ore throat either attended the&s;e di&s;charges of the inte&s;tinal tube, or immediately followed. The Ton&s;ils, Parotids, and maxillary glands ha&s;tily &s;welled to a con&s;idera|ble degree. In &s;ome, the Ton&s;ils only were inflam|ed and &s;welled; in &s;ome a &s;welling of the Parotids accompanied the inflammatory tumours of the Ton|&s;ils; in &s;ome, all the glands abovementioned tume|fied at the &s;ame time. Upon looking into the mouth, there were frequently &s;een, e&s;pecially after the di&s;ea&s;e was a little advanced, <HI>ulcu&s;cula,</HI> &s;catter|ed up and down the <HI>fauces,</HI> which were pretty broad upon, and about the Ton&s;ils, &s;uperficial, (at lea&s;t all, that I &s;aw, were &s;uperficial) and cover|ed with a whiti&s;h &s;lough. The eyes appeared wa|try, and the countenance, particularly the eye-lids
<PB N="5" REF="4">were puffed up, as in the Mea&s;les. In many, the neck, arms, and hands were puffed up, and &s;welled likewi&s;e. And it is not improbable, that the trunk of the body was al&s;o &s;welled, if we could as ea&s;ily have di&s;cerned &s;uch a general en|largement, as we could the enlargement of a par|ticular member. In &s;ome, a cough al&s;o accom|panied the preceding &s;ymptoms. But there was a great difference as to the cough: for in &s;ome, it was &s;light, and rather abated, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanc|ed; while in others, it encrea&s;ed, and grew &s;everer each day than the preceding.</P>
<P>The &s;carlet Efflore&s;cence differed as to degree, and time of its appearance. In &s;ome it appeared immediately on the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e; and That, not always gradually, as many eruptive di&s;|orders do; but in &s;ome it was &s;udden, univer&s;al, and of an inten&s;e red; as inten&s;ely red &s;ometimes upon its fir&s;t appearance, as when the di&s;ea&s;e was further advanced. In &s;ome, there intervened one or more days between the fir&s;t &s;ickening, and the &s;carlet efflo|re&s;cence; and in &s;ome, this efflore&s;cence was par|tial, and gradual in its advances. The legs and thighs
<PB N="6" REF="5">were &s;potted up and down with &s;pots of various di|men&s;ions, &s;ome as large, or larger than a &s;ix-pence, while the trunk of the body was covered with &s;uch an infinite number of them, and &s;o clo&s;ely &s;et toge|ther, that no inter&s;tices appearing, the body was in &s;ome per&s;ons as red almo&s;t, as if it had been dipped in blood. In others again the &s;carlet efflore&s;cence was trifling as to the degree of colour; and &s;o very &s;lightly was the &s;kin tinged, that the di&s;ea&s;e was known, more from the collateral &s;ymptoms, than from the efflore&s;cence. Yet the &s;amene&s;s of &s;ome &s;ymptoms, happening in a family to one or two, where the re&s;t had the di&s;ea&s;e compleat, abun|dantly &s;atisfied me as to the genius of the di&s;tem|per.</P>
<P>From this diver&s;ity of &s;ymptoms, I have found &s;ome practitioners inclined to think, that this di&s;ea&s;e could not with propriety be called a &s;carlet fever. But I imagine, that &s;uch di&s;putes are about words only. For altho' there is a con&s;iderable difference be|tween the pre&s;ent &s;carlet fever, and that milder one, which <HI>Sydenham</HI> de&s;cribes; yet if an increa&s;ed num|ber of &s;ymptoms, and a more exa&s;perated degree
<PB N="7" REF="6">thereof, would authori&s;e a phy&s;ician to alter the name of the difea&s;e, I fear, that confu&s;ion would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a liberty. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the &s;mall Pox might &s;uffer a change in its name; becau&s;e there is not &s;o great, or a greater difference between a former, and the pre&s;ent Scarlet Fever, than there is between &s;mall pox and &s;mall pox; more e&s;pecially if the compari&s;on be made between the milde&s;t degree of the <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> and the mo&s;t violent degree of the <HI>confluent</HI> &s;ort. But if a man con&s;ults <HI>Morton,</HI> as well as <HI>Sydenham,</HI> he will find, that the <HI>febris &s;carlatina</HI> of the former differs greatly from the <HI>febris &s;carlatina</HI> of the latter, as to the appearance, degree, and period of the di&s;ea&s;e. For however mildly <HI>Sydenham</HI> repre&s;ents this di&s;temper, <HI>Morton</HI> &s;cruples not emphatically to term it a plague; and his rea&s;ons are the &s;everity of &s;ome of the &s;ymptoms. In his eleventh ca&s;e, towards the clo&s;e, &s;peaking of a patient, he hath the&s;e words, <HI>a pe&s;te, inquam, eva|&s;it.</HI> And afterwards he goes on thus, <HI>quantum ton&s;il|las, uvulam, fauces, nares, et quamdiu intumui&s;&s;e vidi! quam turgida nonnunquam labia! et quam &s;ordida &s;cabie obducta et exulcerata ab eadem cau&s;a animadverti!</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<P>I might ob&s;erve, that this &s;carlet e&s;hore&s;cence not only differed as to degree in different per&s;ons, but in one and the &s;ame per&s;on, there was often this diver&s;ity. The efflore&s;cence on the face, neck, and brea&s;t was even with the &s;uperficies of the &s;kin (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry&s;ipelas</HI>-like) at lea&s;t &s;o far as the eye could di&s;co|ver; while in other parts, the eruptions were more prominent, and carried the exact appearance of a <HI>Ra&s;h,</HI> (with this difference only, that they were very red) and the cuticle felt with all the a&s;perity of <HI>Fi&s;h|&s;kin,</HI> that &s;pectacle ca&s;es and the like are frequently made of.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the Fever, which in mo&s;t was high, that is to &s;ay, inten&s;e thir&s;t, and the &s;en|&s;ation of a burning heat upon the &s;kin, were the prevailing complaints of the greater part of tho&s;e, who laboured under the di&s;ea&s;e. But even with all this extraordinary heat and increa&s;ed celerity of the blood's motion, the tongue was commonly moi&s;t, furred but &s;lightly, and here and there a per&s;on not very thir&s;ty. Some underwent extreme anxiety and inquietude; &s;ome were delirious for four,
<PB N="9" REF="8">or more days together, without one lucid inter|val or &s;lumber, ince&s;&s;antly talking incoherently. Others were comatous, and when awaked to drink, immediately relap&s;ed to &s;leep again. Only a few complained of head-achs; and even &s;ome of tho&s;e, who were afterwards mo&s;t delirious, did not complain of previous pain in the head. Several were &s;leeple&s;s whole days and nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any de|lirium. Almo&s;t all complained of great dejection of &s;pirits, and &s;udden lo&s;s of &s;trength, which leads me to &s;peak of the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pul&s;e in general was very quick, and very &s;mall; which circum&s;tance, in conjunction with lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and impaired &s;trength, contri|buted a good deal to embarra&s;s the method of cure. For however the inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition of the blood might &s;eemingly call for Bleeding, the untoward &s;ymptoms abovementioned &s;eemed ei|ther to forbid this di&s;charge, or to permit it in &s;uch &s;mall quantities, that little &s;ervice could rea&s;onably be expected from it. And in fact I found that bleed|ing, tho' recour&s;e was had to it at the beginning, was very little beneficial towards the cure of the fe|ver,
<PB N="10" REF="9">tho' often &s;erviceable to the inflamed throat. But of bleeding more hereafter. Let me here add, that there were a few, who&s;e pul&s;e was quick, and not weak; and in this ca&s;e, I ordered plen|tiful bleeding, and even repeated it, if the difficulty of deglutition was con&s;iderable. I remember two patients particularly, the one about eleven years of age, the other about eighteen, each of whom I blood|ed the &s;econd and third day of the di&s;ea&s;e. The fir&s;t bleeding was followed with little, or no benefit to either of them. The next day, finding their ton|&s;ils &s;till greatly &s;welled and inflamed, and appre|hending danger of &s;uffocating in a few hours, I di|rected a further quantity of blood to be taken away, which pre&s;ently abated the&s;e complaints. Their blood was &s;izey each time of bleeding. But tho' in the&s;e, and a few more per&s;ons, the blood was &s;izey, yet in others it was not &s;o, notwith&s;tand|ing they were bled after the di&s;ea&s;e was pretty far ad|vanced: for it is well known, that even in the &s;mall pox, and many other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, the blood, when taken away at the beginning, is fre|quently not &s;izey, tho' found to be &s;o, upon bleeding &s;ome days afterwards. Nor can I recollect, that any
<PB N="11" REF="10">ill effect followed upon bleeding, where I directed it. Tho' there frequently occurred ca&s;es, where the &s;mallne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and lowne&s;s of the &s;pirits deterred me from it. But then the&s;e circum&s;tances were &s;o obvious and glaring, that they could not e&s;cape an inattentive practitioner.</P>
<P>The urine was &s;eldom high coloured, not even the urine of adults; it was generally the complexion of water &s;aturated with a paler clay. And when the fever abated, the urine, as u&s;ually, &s;eparated, and depo&s;ited a thick clay-coloured &s;ediment. In &s;ome indeed, who were remarkably delirious, the urine was limpid and pale, as is common under &s;uch circum&s;tances; but, as the patient mended, the urine had a better colour and con&s;i&s;tence, and threw down a plentiful &s;ediment.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome diver&s;ity in the terminating of this di&s;ea&s;e, both as to the time and manner. When it was not very violent, it terminated, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the fourth or fifth day; that is, the di&s;ea&s;e at that period had arrived to its height, and was on the de|cline. In few or none did the fever leave the pati|ent
<PB N="12" REF="11">&s;o totally, but it recurred once, twice, or more, the evenings following; and grew &s;o mild at each re|turn, as to be little more, than barely noticed: at which time too, all the glandulous &s;wellings common|ly vani&s;hed. But in &s;ome, altho' the fever evident|ly remitted of its &s;everity on the fourth, or fifth day, its returns were of more hours duration, and higher in degree; and a large &s;hare of inquietude continu|ed, even to the eighth, or ninth day. In one per&s;on particularly, the delirium continued after the fever was off, the &s;kin cool, the efflore&s;cence dying away, and the pul&s;e &s;low and regular. In another, when the fever was pa&s;t its height, the Parotids began to &s;well for the fir&s;t time, and continued to enlarge for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; when &s;uddenly they &s;ub&s;id|ed, in a night's time, one half of their increa&s;ed mag|nitude. In two per&s;ons, after the fever was quite re|moved, and the appetite for food returned, the tu|mor of the Parotids &s;till continued, which daily en|crea&s;ed in their bulk, and gradually grew harder, till a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, the right Parotid of the one, and the left Parotid of the other &s;uppurated largely.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>The di&s;temper left a great many very low &s;pirited, complaining of an ill ta&s;te in their mouth, with lo&s;s of &s;trength, and a &s;lowly recovering appetite. The cuticle of almo&s;t all peeled off, as in other &s;carlet fe|vers; and many complained for a long time, that their bodies were as &s;ore within, as without. Such a &s;en&s;ibility indeed they &s;uffered, as rendered them quite unhappy.</P>
<P>In &s;ome the nervous &s;y&s;tem was &s;hattered to &s;uch a degree, that the dejection of &s;pirits, which had accompanied the di&s;ea&s;e thro' all its &s;tages, &s;till continued, when the di&s;temper was over; and the patient dreaded the approach of the evening with an unu&s;ual kind of horror, a&s;&s;uring me, that the &s;hadows which were con&s;equent upon the lighting up of candles, affected their minds with extrava|gant terrors and perturbations. And I well remem|ber, that in a child near three years old, this cir|cum&s;tance was &s;o very remarkable, that upon the candles entering the room, and the &s;hadows ari&s;ing thereupon, the boy appeared with a gha&s;tly &s;tare; and cried with a vehemence not to be pacified, on
<PB N="14" REF="13">di&s;covering the moving &s;hades on the walls of the chamber.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the cure, the method whereof was different in different patients. When the di&s;ea&s;e began with &s;ickne&s;s and purging, as it generally did, I commonly ordered a &s;alt of wormwood mixture, with the te&s;taceous powders in it; upon which the vo|miting and diarrhoea u&s;ually &s;topped, and truly I hardly remember, that they ever returned again. Then if the inflammation and &s;welling of the ton|&s;ils, and parts adjacent required, and the pul&s;e per|mitted, I directed bleeding, and repeated it as the &s;ymptoms indicated. If this method did not take &s;peedy effect, I ordered a ve&s;icatory between the &s;houlders; and for internals, I commonly pre&s;cribed draughts of <HI>&s;perma ceti</HI> and <HI>nitre,</HI> with plentiful dilu|tion, by means of barley-gruel, white wine whey, and other liquors. Sometimes too I ordered <HI>linctu&s;|es,</HI> gratefully acidulated with &s;pirit of vitriol, or in lieu of linctu&s;es, black currant jelly; in order to keep the parts &s;oft and flexible, and to remove or abate that aridity, which is an attendant of inflamed parts, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are expo&s;ed to the air; and the
<PB N="15" REF="14">ton&s;ils may be ju&s;tly regarded in this view, becau&s;e the no&s;trils being generally &s;topped, the patient was obliged to in&s;pire thro' his mouth.</P>
<P>And by this method alone the di&s;temper, when not violent, went thro' its &s;tages with &s;ucce&s;s. But if <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendinum, deliria,</HI> and other threatening &s;ymptoms appeared, I immediately applied <HI>bli&s;ters</HI> likewi&s;e to the arms. And if &s;ymptoms were not obviated hereby, but the pul&s;e al&s;o began to &s;ink, I directed a ve&s;icatory to the head, and exchanged the <HI>nitre</HI> for warmer medicines, &s;uch as the <HI>pulvis bezoardicus, contrayervae comp,</HI> and <HI>confectio cardi|aca.</HI></P>
<P>If the ulcers on the ton&s;ils and <HI>fauces</HI> were foul|er than common, deter&s;ive and a&s;tringent gargari&s;ms were found to be of &s;ervice, by contributing much to bring away the &s;loughs, and facilitate degluti|tion.</P>
<P>If the fever ran high, and the body was very co&s;tive, I ordered an emollient cly&s;ter. But the ob&s;ervati|ons made on bleeding held true likewi&s;e here. For
<PB N="16" REF="15">the u&s;ual weakne&s;s of the patient, and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, &s;eemed to hint, that the&s;e inte&s;tinal di&s;charg|es were the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;carlet efflore&s;cence &s;eemed likewi&s;e to forbid a too great laxity being brought upon the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall conclude, by throwing together a few general ob&s;ervations, which could not conveni|ently be cla&s;&s;ed under the foregoing articles.</P>
<P>Opiates had no beneficial influences to remove watchfulne&s;s. This perhaps is not to be wondered at, during the febrile ebullition; tho' <HI>Sydenham</HI> recom|mends paregorics under the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms, that he hath mentioned of this di&s;ea&s;e. But in three per|&s;ons or more, where the fever was in great part, or altogether off, I gave opiates aromatized; to one, that I might calm the delirium; and to others, that I might procure &s;leep after many nights watching. But all to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I bled one patient, who&s;e pul&s;e was tolerably &s;trong, to remove the delirium and loquacity, that &s;till continued, after the fever was &s;eemingly gone.
<PB N="17" REF="16">But no benefit ari&s;ing in a few hours after bleeding, I ordered bli&s;ters to the arms, admini&s;tered more cor|dial medicines than before; and that night the pati|ent &s;lept &s;everal hours without waking, and after|wards mended apace.</P>
<P>The blood had no &s;ize upon it, the &s;erum was a bright citron, and bore a due proportion to the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> as in health.</P>
<P>In others, under pretty much the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, as the foregoing, but where the pul&s;e was not &s;o &s;trong indeed, I omitted bleeding, and pre|&s;cribed ve&s;icatories, and generous medicines, but no &s;leep en&s;ued hereupon.</P>
<P>I was called to a child of four years old, the &s;e|cond day of the di&s;ea&s;e. He appeared quite bereaved of &s;en&s;e, almo&s;t &s;uffocated, and at the point of death. Immediately I ordered him to be blooded to &s;ix ounces, &s;peedily after which he revived, and came to him&s;elf. The child was naturally &s;ubject to enlarged Ton&s;ils. But this &s;ymptom of &s;trangling ha|&s;tily came on, I think, within the &s;pace of half an
<PB N="18" REF="17">hour, or thereabouts. On the fourth day, at two in the afternoon, it returned again with greater &s;everity, if po&s;&s;ible, than before; tho' &s;everal bli&s;ters that had been applied, di&s;charged mo&s;t copiou&s;ly. The Ton&s;ils were &s;welled to that de|gree, as threatened every minute to preclude all ad|mi&s;&s;ion of air. Whereupon a Surgeon was called in, who attempted to relieve the child, by making in|ci&s;ions on the&s;e glands. And &s;o far the operation an&s;wered the end, that the boy who appeared before in danger every moment of being &s;uffocated, lived 'till about &s;even in the evening. The operation was followed by a pretty deal of blood, and a little purulent matter, which was very offen&s;ive to the &s;mell.</P>
<P>There were two things remarkable in bli&s;tering; the one was, that oftentimes no good effect accrued hereby to the fever, tho' the pul&s;e by the&s;e means was generally rai&s;ed, and the difficulty of degluti|tion &s;omewhat abated. The &s;pirits too were improv|ed by the&s;e applications. And indeed in a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o &s;eemingly threatening, perhaps it would be impru|dent to omit the&s;e applications. For altho' the fever
<PB N="19" REF="18">did not yield to them, &s;o as to &s;horten its &s;tages; yet it is probable, that &s;ymptoms were hereby pre|vented from ri&s;ing to a more dangerous height. And in general it was true, that few were delirious, who&s;e complaints of the throat obliged them to the early application of bli&s;ters. However this ob&s;ervati|on did not always hold good; for there were a few, who had bli&s;ters timely applied, and neverthele&s;s, a &s;ub&s;equent delirium not prevented.</P>
<P>Another remark worth noticing, was the great length of time, that the bli&s;ters continued to di&s;charge. In &s;ome, for eight or ten days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and in &s;ome, much longer.</P>
<P>In general, few &s;weated plentifully, till towards the conclu&s;ion of the cure; <HI>i. e.</HI> till the fever was pa&s;t its height. The younger the patients, the earlier, and the more they &s;weated, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>The appearance of the efflore&s;cence &s;eemed to command but little regard, as to the method of cure. For I have &s;een &s;ome per&s;ons raving, with the erup|tion
<PB N="20" REF="19">fully out, and inten&s;ely red; and I have &s;een others equally delirious, with the eruption &s;paring and pale. So that latterly I did not much con&s;ult the appearance of the efflorence, but I ordered bleed|ing &amp;c. as other circum&s;tances indicated.</P>
<P>It is a general law in eruptive di&s;orders, that the more liberally the eruption comes out, the &s;ecurer is the patient rendered thereby. And yet &s;o little did this rule hold true here, that in two patients, who died, the efflore&s;cence was univer&s;al, and florid to the la&s;t. And in one of them, that <HI>anxietas circa praecordia,</HI> which is u&s;ually mo&s;t urgent in other eruptive fevers, before the eruption breaks out, was in this ca&s;e as exqui&s;ite, when the efflore&s;cence had attained its highe&s;t colour, as before the efflo|re&s;cence made its appearance.</P>
<P>Under the article of cure, I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that the univer&s;al &s;orene&s;s within, which multitudes complained of, was alleviated much by &s;olutions of <HI>&s;perma ceti,</HI> light oleaginous mixtures, broths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when the cough continued, bleeding and a&s;&s;es milk removed this complaint.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<P>But the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom, which oc|curred after the fever was removed, was that great dread upon the &s;pirits mentioned before, which oc|ca&s;ioned the unhappy patient to fear the approach of the evening. Here no <HI>nervous</HI> medicines, as they are called, &s;eemed to take any immediate effect. But air and a re&s;torative diet gradually re&s;tored the per&s;on to better &s;pirits.</P>
<P>From the whole, that I have advanced upon this di&s;ea&s;e, I think it appears, that general rules of cure were precarious and uncertain; and that particular rules were not a&s;certainable, on account of the various appearances, and &s;ymptoms of the di&s;|ea&s;e, and the various con&s;titutions of various patients. And this perhaps furni&s;hes a hint, why mankind are &s;o often di&s;appointed in the peru&s;al of medicinal writers. We are apt to expect too much from them; indeed more, than it is po&s;&s;ible for the art to &s;upply. When authors write generally upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, they &s;eldom write very u&s;efully; and when they write particularly, we grow weary of their prolixity. And perhaps, after the pains of turning over a varie|ty
<PB N="22" REF="21">of volumes, we &s;till find, that the particular ca&s;e we wanted, is either not mentioned at all, or too partially and &s;uperficially, to &s;erve our purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>So that it is in Medicine, as in Navigation. Rules may be laid down, and Charts exhibited; but when a man hath made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the&s;e, he will often find him&s;elf among &s;helves and quick&s;ands; and mu&s;t at la&s;t have recour&s;e to his own natural &s;agacity, to extricate him&s;elf out of the&s;e difficulties.</P>
<P>When ob&s;curities ari&s;e, and emergencies pre&s;s, every practitioner knows, how poor and in&s;ufficient all <HI>&s;y&s;tematic</HI> authors are; and how tedious, and oftentimes unavailing the be&s;t <HI>ob&s;ervators.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity therefore, and &s;uperiority of a phy&s;ician's own judgment, in many ca&s;es, to the writings of others, Your practice and Your &s;ucce&s;s mo&s;t abun|dantly te&s;tify. I am, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect,</P>
