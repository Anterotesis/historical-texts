<HEAD>SHORT ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there is nothing &s;hould le&s;s plead for an apology to the public than addre&s;&s;ing them on what &s;o immediately and import|antly concerns them, the <HI>continuance and re&s;toration of their health;</HI> yet in a metropolis like this, &mdash; where the <HI>nece&s;&s;itous,</HI> the <HI>ignorant,</HI> and <HI>adventurous</HI> are every hour practi&s;ing on the con&s;titutions of their fellow-creatures;&mdash;the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;&s;ibility of my being cla&s;&s;ed in this number would have prevented this addre&s;s, was I not at the &s;ame time &s;o con&s;cious, from many years ab&s;olute experience in a variety of ca&s;es, of the &s;uperior efficacy of this medicine; that, ab|&s;tracted from all other con&s;iderations, I &s;hould hold my&s;elf chargeable, in point of duty, to omit making it as univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, then, and the corroborating &s;ucce&s;s of this medicine for many years I beg leave to recommend to the Public
<Q>NORRIS's ANTIMONIAL DROPS;</Q> which, upon a certainty of their compo&s;ition and &s;alu|tary effects, I pronounce a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> in the following
<PB N="4" REF="4">di&s;orders &mdash; <HI>Inflammatory Fevers, Putrid Bilious Fevers, Slow Latent</HI> (commonly called) <HI>Nervous Fevers,</HI> and <HI>Putrid Sore Throats,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;omuch that, in a va&s;t variety of ca&s;es, where life has been often de&s;paired of, and un|der &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the faculty, there has been no one in&s;tance (at lea&s;t that has ever come to my knowledge) of their being found ineffectual.</P>
<P>I am however aware, that, from the <HI>title</HI> of this medicine, many may have their doubts; as <HI>Antimony,</HI> of all other phy&s;ical productions, has been con&s;i|dered as the mo&s;t violent, and dangerous in it's effects: I will not contradict this popular appre|hen&s;ion; on the contrary, I think it generally well founded; but this I will pledge my&s;elf to &s;ay, that from my particular manner of preparing it, it's <HI>efficacy</HI> can only be equalled by it's <HI>&s;afety;</HI> that it is a medicine of &s;uch &s;ingular or <HI>unique</HI> quality, that it may be taken with equal &s;afety in infancy or old age, by delicate or robu&s;t con&s;titutions in &s;mall or large quantities; and &s;o far from producing any of tho&s;e violent operations, the u&s;ual effects of Antimony, it recovers nature in the mo&s;t friendly manner imaginable, operating without any &s;en&s;ible difference than a degree of per&s;piration, &amp;c. propor|tioned to the nece&s;&s;ity of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that, upon many occa&s;ions, in fevers, phy&s;icians are obliged to wait for what they call the cri&s;is of the di&s;order, and many days are often elap&s;ed in this intermediate, doubtful &s;tate, before any thing can be pronounced in re&s;pect to an opinion on the patient; but this medicine is &s;o immediate, yet
<PB N="5" REF="5">innocent, in it's effects, that it waits for no cri&s;is or particular period; it may be taken in the fir&s;t, mid|dle, or latter &s;tages of the di&s;order, and in any quan|tities, with &s;afety; in &s;hort, it wants but to meet the di&s;ea&s;e to give it an ab&s;olute overthrow.</P>
<P>From the&s;e <HI>po&s;itive</HI> declarations, I am not in&s;en2ible what a ri&s;que I may be thought to run, both in re|&s;pect to my own character and fortune; and indeed I &s;hould feel my&s;elf unworthy not only of the public patronage I have received, but of the common bene|fits of mankind, could I be &s;o lo&s;t to my own honour and con&s;cience, for the mere &s;ake of intere&s;ted views, thus to recommend a medicine, which I even remotely doubted of it's &s;ucce&s;s; but the repeated proofs I have had of it's <HI>never-failing efficacy,</HI> it's immediate, powerful, and &s;afe effects, all give me a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of communicating it to the world under the mo&s;t po|&s;itive and certain a&s;&s;urances.</P>
<P>The&s;e drops, be&s;ides being a &s;pecific for fevers, I have often known &s;ucceed in a variety of other di&s;|orders, &s;uch as <HI>bad dige&s;tion, nervous head-aches, latent &s;curvies,</HI> (the &s;ource of many evils) and infallably in <HI>gouty habits,</HI> where <HI>in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration</HI> is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. And indeed when the extent of their powers, as an univer&s;al deob&s;truent, which lead to a general &s;trengthening and re&s;toration of nature, are con&s;i|dered, the univer&s;ality of their effects will cea&s;e to be wondered at.</P>
<P>Having thus given a &s;ummary account of the virtues of the&s;e <HI>Antimonial Drops,</HI> I am aware of the objections which will naturally ari&s;e from a compara|tive
<PB N="6" REF="6">view of the general mode of medicinal admini|&s;tration, and that which prevails in this e&s;&s;ay: I am likewi&s;e aware of the formidable oppo&s;ition which every great di&s;covery in medicine mu&s;t unavoidably meet with, not only from it's oppo&s;ition to e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, but the uncharitable endeavours of intere&s;ted men, who, under the &s;pecious pretence of it's not being in <HI>common u&s;e,</HI> have invariably reprobated all &s;uch (however beneficial to mankind) as dangerous or uncertain. Though the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Antimonial Drops</HI> would be a convincing an&s;wer to &s;uch in&s;inuations; yet, as many have not experienced their effects; and as I would willingly obviate every difficulty, as well for the &s;ake of my own reputation as the &s;atisfaction of the Public; I &s;hall &s;ubmit the following apology for my conduct.</P>
<P>It is generally objected to tho&s;e, who have labour|ed through a painful cour&s;e of years, and have been at great expences in the di&s;covery, and preparation of medicine, that to make a my&s;tery for private emolu|ment of what &s;o e&s;&s;entially affects public benefit, is repugnant to tho&s;e principles of univer&s;al charity, which &s;hould actuate the human brea&s;t:&mdash;This, at fir&s;t blu&s;h, I own &s;eems plau&s;ible, but then it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the <HI>means</HI> of throwing this into <HI>Com|mon U&s;e,</HI> may de&s;troy its effects; as the excellency of a medicine depends not &s;o much on the &s;ubject from which it is taken, as the great care and judgement in the preparation. A common chemi&s;t, in &s;horten|ing the nece&s;&s;ary period of preparation, di&s;pen&s;ing with accidents &s;ub&s;tituting apparently-&s;imilar bo|dies
<PB N="7" REF="7">or by any of tho&s;e various means, which may &s;ave his time, or increa&s;e his profits, may think him&s;elf &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified for &s;o doing by <HI>the u&s;age of trade:</HI> But the more careful chemi&s;t, con|&s;cious that the lea&s;t accident or mi&s;management is frequently &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h the virtues of his proce&s;s, and having nothing &s;o much at heart, as the credit of his medicine, is barred by no labour, no time, no expences, no di&s;appointments, in bringing to perfection this his favourite object.</P>
<P>Permit me then to rank my&s;elf in this la&s;t cla&s;s, who, from dedicating the be&s;t part of my life to Che|mical proce&s;&s;es, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well acquainted with the minute&s;t preparation of me|dicine; and on the credit of this experience let me add; that, what from the judgment and accuracy required, together with the many accidents to which it is liable, the proce&s;s of my <HI>Antimonial Drops</HI> can &s;carcely be compleated in the way of <HI>Common bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> This con&s;ideration then alone, I flatter my&s;elf, will fully ju&s;tify my conduct to the judicious and im|partial part of mankind.</P>
<P>I have already been &s;ufficiently explicit in enu|merating the virtues of this medicine; I do not therefore mean to take up any more of the attention of the Public; otherwi&s;e, than as the PRESERVATION and RESTORATION of health form the principal and greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of life, that they &s;trictly examine into it's merits. If it turns out to be productive of tho&s;e benefits I have mentioned; &s;urely I cannot be thought pre&s;uming to expect that a public reward &s;hould follow &s;o public a benefit. If on the contrary I &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="8">be found one of tho&s;e forward daring empyricks, who are heedle&s;s what &s;acrifices they make to their own intere&s;ts; let me be branded with that infamy, which tho&s;e who endeavour to deceive mankind in &s;uch important matters de&s;erve.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave to reque&s;t all tho&s;e who have honoured me with their confidence, and who by ex|perience or ob&s;ervation are vouchers of the efficacy of this medicine, to favor me with their names and addre&s;s, that, by the permitted publication of &s;uch authority, to be from time to time added to this e&s;&s;ay, I may be the better enabled to render as univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible &s;o great a benefit to mankind.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>F.</HI> a re&s;pectable trade&s;man in the city of Lon|don. His daughter, a weakly delicate child, about five years of age, was &s;orely afflicted with a &s;welled &s;tomach, and con&s;tipation in her bowels; together with indige&s;tion, a Slow Fever, and a &s;harp corro&s;ive humour in her blood. To the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of her parents, who had de&s;paired of her recove|ry, &s;he is happily re&s;tored to health, by the virtues of this invaluable medicine. Two of his &s;ervants were cured of a Putrid Fever; the one in his own hou&s;e, very &s;peedily, and went about his bu&s;ine&s;s in a few days; the other &s;oon after was attacked with the &s;ame di&s;order: for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to his ma&s;ter he &s;ent him to I&s;lington, and put him under the care of an apothecary there, but hearing very un|favorable accounts of him daily, he went to &s;ee him, and &s;ent for the apothecary, who told him, among other things, that his Fever was a very dangerous one, and mu&s;t wait for a cri&s;is, &amp;c.

<P>This young man after bleeding, bli&s;tering, leeches applied to his temples, and every other means in common practice made u&s;e of to no good purpo&s;e; his brother, with whom he lives, was advi&s;ed to try in this de&s;perate ca&s;e my Antimonial Drops; he made &s;ome enquiries about me at the Carolina Coffee-hou&s;e in Birchin-lane, where I frequently go when in the city; &s;atisfied with Mr. Carr's, and &s;everal gentlemens re|port of me there, the Drops were immediately ad|mini&s;ter'd according to directions; the next day I happened to call at the coffee-hou&s;e, when Mr. Carr, who keeps it, after reciting what had pa&s;t, was &s;orry to inform me the young man was no better, and then pa&s;t all hope; that as I was &s;o near he thought it ad|vi&s;eable I &s;hould call; I did; and, never did I &s;ee a human being &s;o near death: I could feel no pul&s;e; he lay on his back with his eyes wide open and fixed, &s;peechle&s;s, and motionle&s;s to all appearance. Being the fir&s;t in&s;tance of my Antimonial Drops failing in Fevers, at lea&s;t that ever came to my knowledge, made me more particularly inqui&s;itive about the admini&s;tra|tion of them, when, (to my great &s;urprize) the bro|ther of my patient a&s;&s;ured me with much concern, they

There was no time to be lo&s;t in reproof; it was now one o'clock at noon, I imme|diately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Mr. Parker's, for a half guinea bottle of Drops, a table &s;poonful of which was poured down that in&s;tant, with di|rections, if he lived an hour and an half, to re|peat it, and continue to give him that quantity every two hours after, till a &s;weat or &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;igns of amendment were di&s;covered; and then to dimi|ni&s;h the do&s;e gradually; that no other medicine &s;hould be admini&s;tered on any account, but, to let him have as much baum tea, or any &s;imple di|luting liquor as they could get down, by little and little, every now and then; the blunder committed before, made them now doubly diligent and punctual; I called the next day, and found the Fever was quite gone; but &s;uch a la&s;&s;itude and &s;tupidity re|mained as exceeds all de&s;cription. The nur&s;e in|formed me he lay very quiet till five o'clock; about &s;ix, he began to per&s;pire, and continued &s;o to do the whole night plentifully; &s;leeping all the time; which from his laying very &s;till and motionle&s;s, and as &s;he thought breathle&s;s too, made her &s;everal times conclude he was dead, till by laying on her hand every now and then &s;he was &s;atisfied to the con|trary.

<P>This gentleman informed me, that from Africa to St. Kitt's, he had lo&s;t upwards of &s;eventy &s;laves, not being able to prevail on the &s;urgeon to admi|ni&s;ter my Antimonial Drops to them. When he arrived at St. Kitt's the doctor quitted the &s;hip, and the captain then had about &s;eventy &s;laves left, which he was to take to Carolina: in the pa&s;&s;age ten or twelve of them were &s;eized with the &s;ame Fever the others died of; being then with|out a &s;urgeon, he had recour&s;e to my Antimonial Drops, which recovered them; verily believing, if
<PB N="21" REF="21">timely admini&s;tered, nine out of ten of tho&s;e that were lo&s;t might have been &s;aved. The&s;e Drops were &s;ent, by way of experiment, at the in&s;tance of a worthy gentleman, a merchant in the city, much in|tere&s;ted in African affairs, and under the peculiar care of Captain Reynolds, the only one, he &s;aid, he could depend upon to make a ju&s;t report; before which, and &s;ince, &s;everal &s;mall boxes were &s;ent to merchants at Liverpool, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and &s;ome few from the port of London al&s;o; but, &s;trange to tell! when immediately under the care and admi|ni&s;tration of the &s;urgeon, all their influence were gone, and they became of none effect. It would be no very ea&s;y matter to prevail upon many commanders of &s;hips who &s;ail without &s;urgeons, to credit this report from their own experience. This I am very well a&s;&s;ured of, and could venture my credit, reputation, and fortune, upon the event, that if the &s;urgeons of &s;hips were actuated by the &s;ame di&s;intere&s;ted principles; my Antimonial Drops would prove a great acqui&s;i|tion not only to the African company in pre&s;erving their negroes, but the lives of thou&s;ands &s;ubject to putrid fevers in hot climates.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="22">of the effects of your Antimonial Drops, in the cour&s;e of my late voyage to and from Falkland's I&s;land.</P>
<P>In the outward pa&s;&s;age, by the &s;urgeon of the &s;hip's report to me, of the 5th of April la&s;t, it appeared, that Geo. Hunter, and Laur. Pittman, two of the &s;eamen, were taken ill with Malignant Fevers; that having for &s;everal days been given the u&s;ual medicines without effect, he thought them pa&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility of recovery; judging this a fit opportunity to make a trial of the efficacy of your drops, (for notwith&s;tanding the recommenda|tions which were given me of them, and which induced me to take them with me, I had re&s;olved to let every u&s;ual means take place before I gave them) I then therefore gave a bottle to the &s;urgeon, and de&s;ired they might be admini&s;tered; he &s;aid, it would, he believed, be of little con&s;equence whatever was given them, as he thought they could not live to the next day, however, he would try them; the next morning, in his account to me of the &s;ick, he told me the men were much better, and he believed they would recover, which from that time they did, and were &s;oon after able to do their duty in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July following, being in the &s;outhern part of the Torrid zone, Mr. Jo&s;lin, the boat&s;wain of the &s;hip, was taken ill of the &s;ame Fever, with the like &s;ymptoms as the two former, and after the &s;urgeon had repre&s;ented to me, that he had u&s;ed all the means in his power for his re|covery,
<PB N="23" REF="23">to no purpo&s;e, the Antimonial Drops were given, and had the de&s;ired effect, by his imme|diate recovery.</P>
<P>Sometime afterwards, in the &s;outhern ocean, Ja. Hamm, and Evan Williams, the one a boy, the other a marine, were &s;eized with a fever, and were, by the &s;urgeons report to me, given over for many days; the Drops were given them al&s;o, which pro|duced a plentiful &s;weating, and their immediate recovery. Such repeated &s;ucce&s;s gives me the highe&s;t opinion of the virtues and efficacy of your Antimonial Drops, and on the&s;e grounds I cannot too &s;trongly recommend them.</P>

<SALUTE>"Much re&s;pected Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THY favour, with a box of Antimonial Drops, I received by means of our Friend Eyre, about 16 la&s;t 12 mo. They have gained great reputation in the&s;e parts, and being the time of our general a&s;&s;embly in Newbern, and my own ac|quaintance being very exten&s;ive in this province, I had an opportunity of recommending them to many people; carried &s;ome to our good governor Mar|tin. Immediately on receiving them, I gave &s;ome to my own child, about two years old, who was feveri&s;h, and much out of order. Every one in my family could ob&s;erve a &s;udden change for the better: I have continued to give him a few at times, and the child is brave and hearty. Another child, about twelve months old, that had been long &s;ick, had lo&s;t all appetite, I advi&s;ed them, which in a few days recovered his health and appe|tite. A negro man in my own employ, about 23 years of age, by much wading in the water, got a &s;evere pleuri&s;y; it being about 20 miles from where I re&s;ide my&s;elf, they bled him, after &s;ome days &s;weated him; he went out before his &s;weat was off, and grew &s;o bad, they &s;ent me word they thought he would die. I immediately di&s;patched orders to
<PB N="26" REF="26">give him the Antimonial drops, and he &s;oon reco|vered.</P>
<P>Two per&s;ons, that had them of me, were cured of &s;tubborn coughs, which, I believe, would &s;oon have terminated in con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>A married woman, not with child, catched a con&s;iderable cold, which occa&s;ioned a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the m&mdash;, with fever and great pains. I ad|vi&s;ed the u&s;e of the drops, which &s;oon abated the pains, fever, and head-ach, and in about two days time &s;et nature to act for her&s;elf in the natural way.</P>
<P>I mention tho&s;e few particulars, more for the conviction of others than thy own confirmation. Indeed, for my own part, I believe the drops to be the mo&s;t &s;overeign remedy ever yet found out, for what thou recommends them, and may prove advantageous in many ca&s;es which are not mentioned in thy directions."</P>
