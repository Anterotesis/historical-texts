<HEAD>PREFACE, ADDRESSED TO PARENTS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced, that the fate of empires depended on the education of youth.</P>
<BIBL><HI>ARISTOTLE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Motto from Ari&s;totle may appear pedantic, but it was cho&s;en merely to oppo&s;e &s;uch high authority to the following a&s;&s;ertions of Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>"Education," &s;ays he, <Q>is as well known, and has long been as well known as ever it can be. Endeavouring to make children prematurely wi&s;e is u&s;ele&s;s labour. Suppo&s;e they have more know|ledge at five or &s;ix years old than other children, what u&s;e can be made of it? It will be lo&s;t before it is wanted, and the wa&s;te of &s;o much time and labour of the teacher is never to be re|paid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bo&s;well's Life of John&s;on.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash;The remainder of this pa&s;&s;age contains &s;uch an illiberal attack upon a celebrated female
<PB N="iv" REF="4">writer, as ought &s;urely to have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Dr. John&s;on's biographer. When the Doctor at|tempted to ridicule this lady for keeping an infant boarding-&s;chool, and for conde&s;cending to write ele|mentary books for children, he forgot his own eu|logium upon Dr. Watts, of whom he &s;peaks thus:</P>
<P><Q>For children he conde&s;cended to lay a&s;ide the philo&s;opher, the &s;cholar, and the wit, to write little poems of devotion, and &s;y&s;tems of in&s;truc|tion adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn of rea&s;on, to its gradation of advance in the morning of life. Every man acquainted with the common principles of human action, will look with veneration on the writer, who is at one time combating Locke, and at another time making a catechi&s;m for <HI>chilaren in their fourth year.</HI> A vo|luntary de&s;cent from the dignity of &s;cience is per|haps the harde&s;t le&s;&s;on which humility can teach.</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems however a very ea&s;y ta&s;k to write for children. Tho&s;e only who have been intere&s;ted in the education of a family, who have patiently fol|lowed children through the fir&s;t proce&s;&s;es of rea&s;oning, who have daily watched over their thoughts and feelings: tho&s;e only, who know with what ea&s;e and rapidity the early a&s;&s;ociations of ideas are formed, on which the future ta&s;te, character, and happine&s;s de|pend, can feel the dangers and difficulties of &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5">
For a length of time education was cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the &s;ubjects of vague and metaphy&s;ical &s;peculation; but, of late, it has attained its proper &s;tation in ex|perimental philo&s;ophy.&mdash;The &s;ober &s;en&s;e of Locke, and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic eloquence of Rou&s;&s;eau, have di|rected to this object the attention of philo&s;ophers and men of genius. Many theories have been in|vented, &s;everal ju&s;t ob&s;ervations have been made, and &s;ome few facts have been e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Dr. Reid remarks, that <Q>if we could obtain a di&s;tinct and full hi&s;tory of all that hath pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of a child, from the beginning of life and &s;en&s;ation, till it grows up to the u&s;e of rea&s;on, how its in&s;ant faculties began to work, and how they brought forth and ripened all the various no|tions, opinions, and &s;entiments, which we find in our&s;elves, when we come to be capable of re&s;lec|tion, this would be a trea&s;ure of natural hi&s;tory, which would probably give more light into the human faculties, than all the &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;o|phers about them, &s;ince the beginning of the world. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Reid, on the Intellectual Powers of Man.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Indeed in all &s;ciences the grand difficulty has been to a&s;certain &s;acts&mdash;a difficulty which, in the &s;cience of education, peculiar circum&s;tances con&s;pire to in|crea&s;e. Here the objects of every experiment are &s;o
<PB N="vi" REF="6">intere&s;ting, that we cannot hold our minds indiffe|rent to the re&s;ult. Nor is it to be expected, that many regi&s;ters of experiments, &s;ucce&s;sful and un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, &s;hould be kept, much le&s;s &s;hould be pub|li&s;hed, when we con&s;ider, that the combined powers of affection and vanity, of partiality to his child, and to his theory, will act upon the mind of a pa|rent, in oppo&s;ition to the ab&s;tract love of ju&s;tice, and the general de&s;ire to increa&s;e the wi&s;dom and happi|ne&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties, an attempt to keep &s;uch a regi&s;ter has actually been made: it was begun in the year 1776, long before Doctor Reid's book was publi&s;hed. The de&s;ign has from time to time been pur&s;ued to this pre&s;ent year; and though much has not been collected, every circum&s;tance and conver&s;ation that has been pre&s;erved is faithfully and accurately related.</P>
<P>The&s;e notes have been of great advantage to the writer of the following Stories; and will probably, at &s;ome future time, be laid before the public, as a collection of experiments upon a &s;ubject which has been hitherto treated theoretically.</P>
<P>The following tales have been divided into two parts, as they were de&s;igned for different cla&s;&s;es of children. The que&s;tion, whether &s;ociety could &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without the di&s;tinction of ranks, is a que&s;tion
<PB N="vii" REF="7">involving a variety of complicated di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which we leave to the politician and the legi&s;lator. At pre&s;ent, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the education of different ranks &s;hould, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be different; they have few ideas, few habits in common; their pecu|liar vices and virtues do not ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es, and their ambition is to be directed to diffe|rent objects. But ju&s;tice, truth, and humanity, are confined to no particular rank, and &s;hould be en|forced with equal care and energy upon the minds of young people of every &s;tation; and it is hoped that the&s;e principles have never been forgotten in the fol|lowing pages.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t &s;tories, "The Orange Man," and "Tru&s;ty," were written for a much earlier age than any of the others, and with &s;uch a perfect &s;im|plicity of expre&s;&s;ion as, to many, may appear in|&s;ipid and ridiculous. This degree of &s;implicity is, however, nece&s;&s;ary &s;or very young children, who, when they begin to learn to read, &s;hould be rewarded for the trouble of decyphering every word, by being enabled to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of the whole. Since the&s;e two Stories were written, a number of excellent little books have &s;upplied the deficiency which was then complained of by all parents. It was not, therefore, thought nece&s;&s;ary to write any more for that age. In the tales which &s;ucceed to them in this
<PB N="viii" REF="8">collection the &s;ame &s;implicity of language has <HI>not</HI> been ob&s;erved. The u&s;e of elementary books is to &s;tore the minds of children with facts, and to enlarge their vocabulary. After the&s;e purpo&s;es have been effected, it is wa&s;te of time, and a mere u&s;ele&s;s ex|erci&s;e of the memory, to continue this &s;pecies of reading. As the ideas of children multiply, the lan|guage of their books &s;hould become le&s;s &s;imple; el&s;e their ta&s;te will quickly be di&s;gu&s;ted, or will remain &s;tationary. Children that live with people who con|ver&s;e with elegance, will not be contented with a &s;tyle inferior to what they hear from every body near them.</P>
<P>It may be remarked, that almo&s;t all language is metaphorick&mdash;from the conver&s;ation of the maid in the nur&s;ery, who lulls a cro&s;s infant to &s;leep, to that of the lady in the drawing-room, who, with &s;illy civility, takes a child upon her lap to entertain it by a repetition of fa&s;hionable phra&s;es. <HI>Slang</HI> (the term is di&s;gracefully naturalized in our vocabulary) contains as much and as ab&s;tract metaphor as can be found in the mo&s;t refined literary language. Nor have we rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that one kind of meta|phor is more difficult than another to be under&s;tood by children; they frequently hear the mo&s;t compli|cated metaphorical expre&s;&s;ions in conver&s;ation, &s;uch as allude to our fa&s;hions and the prejudices of &s;ociety, with which they are utterly unacquainted.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="9">
All poetical allu&s;ions have however been avoided in this book&mdash;only &s;uch &s;ituations are de&s;cribed, as children can ca&s;ily imagine, and which may con&s;e|quently intere&s;t their feelings.&mdash;Such examples of virtue are painted as are not above their conception of excellence, and their powers of &s;ympathy and emulation.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to give <HI>rewards</HI> to children, which &s;hall not indirectly do them harm, by fo&s;tering &s;ome hurtful ta&s;te or pa&s;&s;ion. In the &s;tory of Lazy Law|rence, where the object was to excite a &s;pirit of in|du&s;try, care has been taken to proportion the reward to the exertion, and to point out, that people feel cheerful and happy whil&s;t they are employed. The reward of our indu&s;trious boy, though it be money, is only money con&s;idered as the means of gratifying a benevolent wi&s;h. In a commercial nation, it is e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eparate, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;pirit of indu&s;try and avarice; and to beware le&s;t we introduce Vice under the form of Virtue.</P>
<P>In the &s;tory of Tarlton and Loveit are repre&s;ented the danger and the folly of that weakne&s;s of mind, and ea&s;ine&s;s to be led, which too often pa&s;s for good-nature; and, in the &s;tory of the Fal&s;e Key, are pointed out &s;ome of the evils to which a well-educated boy, when he fir&s;t goes to &s;ervice, is ex|po&s;ed, from the profligacy of his fellow-&s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10">
In the Birth-day Pre&s;ent, in the Hi&s;tory of Mademoi&s;elle Panache, and in the character of Mrs. There&s;a Tattle, in the &s;econd part, the Parent's A&s;|&s;i&s;tant has pointed out the dangers which may ari&s;e in education from a bad &s;ervant, a &s;illy governe&s;s, and a common acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the Barring-out, the errors to which a high &s;pirit and the love of party are apt to lead, have been made the &s;ubject of correction; and it is hoped that the common fault of making the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous characters appear the mo&s;t <HI>active,</HI> and the mo&s;t in|genious, has been as much as po&s;&s;ible avoided. <HI>Un|&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> cunning will not be admired, and cannot induce imitation.</P>
<P>It has likewi&s;e been attempted in the&s;e Stories to provide antidotes again&s;t ill-humour, the epidemic rage for di&s;&s;ipation, and the fatal propen&s;ity to admire and imitate whatever the fa&s;hion of the moment may di&s;tingui&s;h. Were young people, either in public Schools or in private families, ab&s;olutely free from bad examples, it would not be advi&s;eable to intro|duce de&s;picable and vicious characters in books in|tended for their improvement. But in real life they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ee vice, and it is be&s;t that they &s;hould be early &s;hocked with the repre&s;entation of what they are to avoid. There is a great deal of difference between innocence and ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11">
To prevent precepts of morality from tiring the ear and the mind, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make the &s;to|ries in which they are introduced in &s;ome mea&s;ure dramatic; to keep alive hope, and fear, and curi|o&s;ity, by &s;ome degree of intricacy. At the &s;ame time care has been taken to avoid inflaming the ima|gination, or exciting a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of adventure, by exhibiting fal&s;e views of life, and creating hopes which, in the ordinary cour&s;e of things, cannot be reali&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on&mdash;to recur to him, not from a &s;pirit of contradiction, but from a fear that his authority &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h dangerous errors&mdash;Dr. John&s;on &s;ays, that <Q>Babies do not like to hear &s;tories of babies like them&s;elves; that they require to have their imaginations rai&s;ed by tales of giants and fairies, and ca&s;tles and inchantments.</Q>&mdash;The fact remains to be proved: but &s;uppo&s;ing that they do prefer &s;uch tales, is this a rea&s;on why they &s;hould be indulged in reading them? It may be &s;aid that a little ex|perience in life would &s;oon convince them, that fai|ries, and giants, and enchanters, are not to be met with in the world. But why &s;hould the mind be filled with fanta&s;tic vi&s;ions, in&s;tead of u&s;eful know|ledge? Why &s;hould &s;o much valuable time be lo&s;t? Why &s;hould we vitiate their ta&s;te, and &s;poil their appetite, by &s;uffering them to feed upon &s;weetmeats?
<PB N="xii" REF="12">It is to be hoped, that the magic of Dr. John&s;on's name will not have power to re&s;tore the reign of fairies.</P>
<P>But even when the improbability of fairy tales is avoided, care &s;hould be taken to keep objects in their ju&s;t proportions, when we attempt an imitation of real life.</P>
<P><Q>Love, hatred, fear and anger, are to be rai&s;ed in the &s;oul,</Q> &s;ays an eminent poet, <Q>by &s;hew|ing their objects out of their true proportion, ei|ther greater than the life or le&s;s; but in&s;truction is to be given, by &s;hewing them what they really are.</Q></P>
<P>And &s;urely a writer, who &s;incerely wi&s;hes to in|crea&s;e the happine&s;s of mankind, will find it ea&s;y to give up the fame that might be acquired by elo|quence, when it is injurious to the cau&s;e of truth.</P>

<P>VERY, very little children mu&s;t not read this &s;tory, for they cannot under&s;tand it; they will not know what is meant by a liear, and a boy of truth.</P>
<P>Very little children, when they are a&s;ked a que&s;tion, &s;ay "yes," and "no," without know|ing the meaning of the words; but you, chil|dren, who can &s;peak quite plain, and who can tell, by words, what you wi&s;h for, and what you want, and what you have &s;een, and what you have done; you who under&s;tand what is meant by the words "I have done it," or "I have not," you may read this &s;tory, for you can under&s;tand it.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="16">mother of it; and when any body a&s;ked him about any thing which he had done or &s;aid, he always told the truth; &s;o that every body who knew him believed him: but nobody who knew his brother Robert believed a word which he &s;aid, becau&s;e he u&s;ed to tell lies. Whenever he did any thing wrong, he never ran to his father and mother to tell them of it; but when they a&s;ked him about it, he denied it, and &s;aid he had not done the things which he had done. The rea&s;on that Robert told lies was, becau&s;e he was afraid of being puni&s;hed for his faults if he confe&s;&s;ed them. He was a coward, and could not bear the lea&s;t pain; but Frank was a brave boy, and could bear to be puni&s;hed for little faults: his mother never puni&s;hed him &s;o much for &s;uch little faults, as &s;he did Ro|bert for the lies which he told, and which &s;he found out afterward.</P>
<P>One evening the&s;e two little boys were play|ing together in a room by them&s;elves; their mother was ironing in a room next to them, and their father was out at work in the fields, &s;o there was nobody in the room with Robert and Frank; but there was a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle dog Tru&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ving by the fire-&s;ide. Tru&s;ty was a pretty
<PB N="3" REF="17">playful little dog, and the children were very fond of him.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid Robert to Frank, "there is Tru&s;ty lying be&s;ide the fire a&s;leep, let us go and waken him, and he will play with us."&mdash;"O yes, do, let us," &s;aid Frank. So they both ran to|gether towards the hearth to waken the dog. Now there was a ba&s;on of milk &s;tanding upon the hearth, and the little boys did not &s;ee where|abouts it &s;tood, for it was behind them: as they were both playing with the dog, they kicked it with their fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and threw it down; and the ba&s;on broke, and all the milk ran out of it over the hearth, and about the floor; and when the little boys &s;aw what they had done, they were very &s;orry, and frightened, but they did not know what to do: they &s;tood for &s;ome time looking at the broken ba&s;on and the milk, with|out &s;peaking. Robert &s;poke fir&s;t.</P>
<P>"So, we &s;hall have no milk for &s;upper to|night," &s;aid he, and he &s;ighed &mdash;</P>
<P>"No milk for &s;upper!&mdash;why not?" &s;aid Frank; "is there no more milk in the hou&s;e." "Yes, but we &s;hall have none of it; for do not you remember, la&s;t Monday, when we threw down the milk, my mother &s;aid we were very
<PB N="4" REF="18">carele&s;s, and that the next time we did &s;o, we &s;hould have no more,&mdash;and this is the next time; &s;o we &s;hall have no milk for &s;upper to|night."</P>
<P>"Well, then," &s;aid Frank, "we mu&s;t do without it, that's all: we will take more care another time; there's no great harm done; come, let us run and tell my mother. You know &s;he bid us always tell her directly when we broke any thing; &s;o come," &s;aid he, taking hold of his brother's hand. "I will come ju&s;t now," &s;aid Robert; "don't be in &s;uch a hurry, Frank&mdash;can't you &s;tay a minute?" So Frank &s;tayed: and then he &s;aid, "Come now, Ro|bert." But Robert an&s;wered, "Stay a little longer, for I dare not go yet&mdash;I am afraid."</P>
<P>Little boys, I ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e you, never be afraid to tell the truth; never &s;ay <HI>"&s;tay a minute,"</HI> and, <HI>"&s;tay a little longer,"</HI> but run directly, and tell of what you have done that is wrong. The longer you &s;tay, the more afraid you will grow; till at la&s;t, perhaps, you will not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to tell the truth at all. &mdash; Hear what happened to Robert.</P>
<P>The longer he &s;tayed, the more unwilling he was to go to tell his mother that he had thrown the milk down; and at la&s;t he pulled his hand
<PB N="5" REF="19">away from his brother, and cried, "I won't go at all; Frank, can't you go by your&s;elf?" &mdash; "Yes," &s;aid Frank, "&s;o I will; I am not afraid to go by my&s;elf: I only waited for you out of good-nature, becau&s;e I thought you would like to tell the truth too."</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;o I will; I mean to tell the truth when I am a&s;ked; but I need not go now, when I do not choo&s;e it:&mdash;and why need you go either?&mdash;can't you wait here?&mdash;&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y my mo|ther can &s;ee the milk when &s;he comes in."&mdash; Frank &s;aid no more, but, as his brother would not come, he went without him. He opened the door of the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> room, where he thought his mother was ironing; but when he went in, he &s;aw that &s;he was gone, and he thought &s;he was gone to fetch &s;ome more clothes to iron. The clothes, he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, were hanging on the bu&s;hes in the garden; &s;o he thought his mo|ther was gone there, and he ran after her to tell what had happened.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t Frank was gon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Robert was left in the room by him&s;elf; and all the while he was alone he was thinking of &s;ome excu&s;es to make to his mother, and he was &s;orry that Frank was gone to tell her the truth. He &s;aid
<PB N="6" REF="20">to him&s;elf, "If Frank and I both were to &s;ay, that we did not throw down the ba&s;on, &s;he would believe us, and we &s;hould have milk for &s;upper. I am very &s;orry Frank would go to tell her about it." Ju&s;t as he &s;aid this to him&s;elf, he heard his mother coming down &s;tairs. "Oh ho!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "then my mother has not been out in the garden, and &s;o Frank has not met her, and cannot have told her; &s;o now I may &s;ay what I plea&s;e."</P>
<P>Then this naughty, cowardly boy determin|ed to tell his mother a lie.</P>
<P>She came into the room; but when &s;he &s;aw the broken ba&s;on, and the milk &s;pilled, &s;he &s;top|ped &s;hort, and cried&mdash;</P>
<P>"So, &s;o! &mdash;what a piece of work is here! &mdash; who did this, Robert?"</P>
<P>"I don't know, ma'am," &s;aid Robert, in a very low voice.</P>
<P>"You don't know, Robert! &mdash;tell me the truth&mdash;I &s;hall not be angry with you, child&mdash; you will only lo&s;e the milk at &s;upper; and as for the ba&s;on, I would rather have you break all the ba&s;ons I have, than tell me one lie.&mdash;So don't tell me a lie. &mdash;I a&s;k you, Robert, did you break the ba&s;on?"</P>

"<HI>No, ma'am,</HI> I did not," &s;aid Robert, and he coloured as red as fire.</P>
<P>"Then, where's Frank?&mdash;did he do it?" &mdash;"No mother, he did not," &s;aid Robert; for he was in hopes, that when Frank came in, he &s;hould per&s;uade him to &s;ay that he did not do it.</P>
<P>"How do you know", &s;aid his mother, "that Frank did not do it?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e, ma'am," &s;aid Robert, he&s;itating, as liars do for an excu&s;e&mdash; "becau&s;e I was in the room all the time, and I did not &s;ee him do it."</P>
<P>"Then how was the ba&s;on thrown down? If you have been in the room all the time you can tell."</P>

"Tru&s;ty, Tru&s;ty," &s;aid his mother, turning round; and Tru&s;ty, who was lying before the fire, drying his legs, which were wet with the milk, jump|ed up, and came to her. Then &s;he &s;aid, "Fie! fie! Tru&s;ty!" and &s;he pointed to the milk.
<PB N="8" REF="22">"Get me a &s;witch out of the garden, Robert; Tru&s;ty mu&s;t be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t for this." Robert ran for the &s;witch, and in the garden he met his bro|ther: he &s;topped him, and told him, in a great hurry, all that he had &s;aid to his mother; and he begged of him not to tell the truth, but to &s;ay the &s;ame as he had done.</P>
<P>"No, I will not tell a lie," &s;aid Frank.&mdash; "What! and is Tru&s;ty to be beat!&mdash;he did not throw down the milk, and he &s;han't be beat for it&mdash;let me go to my mother."</P>
<P>They both ran toward the hou&s;e; Robert got fir&s;t home, and he locked the hou&s;e door, that Frank might not come in. He gave the &s;witch to his mother. Poor Tru&s;ty! he looked up as the &s;witch was l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fted over his head, but <HI>he</HI> could not &s;peak, to tell the truth. Ju&s;t as the blow was falling upon him, Frank's voice was heard at the window,&mdash;"Stop, &s;top! dear mo|ther, &s;top!" cried he, as loud as ever he could call; "Tru&s;ty did not do it&mdash;let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&mdash;I and Robert did it&mdash;but do not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Robert."</P>
<P>"Let us in, let us in," cried another voice, which Robert k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew to be his father's; "I am ju&s;t come from work, and here's the do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lock|ed." Robert turned as pale as a&s;hes when he
<PB N="9" REF="23">heard his father's voice, for his father always whipped him when he told a lie.</P>
<P>His mother went to the door, and unlocked it. "What's all this?" cried his father, as he came in; &s;o his mother told him all that had happened;&mdash;how the milk had been thrown down; how &s;he had a&s;ked Robert whether he had done it; and he &s;aid that he had not, nor that Frank had not done it, but that Tru&s;ty the dog had done it; how &s;he was ju&s;t going to beat Tru&s;ty, when Frank came to the window and told the truth. "Where is the &s;witch with which you were going to beat Tru&s;ty?" &s;aid the father.</P>
<P>Then Robert, who &s;aw, by his father's looks, that he was going to beat him, fell upon his knees, and cried for mercy, &s;aying, "Forgive me this time, and I will never tell a lie again."</P>
<P>But his father caught hold of him by the arm&mdash;"I will whip you now," &s;aid he, "and then, I hope, you will not." So Robert was whipped, till he cried &s;o loud with the pain, that the whole neighbourhood could hear him.</P>
<P>"There," &s;aid his father, when he had done, "now go to &s;upper; you are to have no
<PB N="10" REF="24">milk to night, and you have been whipped. See how liars are &s;erved!" Then, turning to Frank, "Come here, and &s;hake hands with me, Frank; you will have no milk for &s;upper, but that does not &s;ignify; you have told the truth, and have not been whipped, and every body is plea&s;ed with you. And now I'll tell you what I will do for you&mdash;I will give you the little dog Tru&s;ly, to be your own dog. You &s;hall feed him, and take care of him, and he &s;hall be your dog; you have &s;aved him a beating, and I'll an&s;wer for it you'll be a good ma&s;ter to him. Tru&s;ty, Tru&s;ty, come here." Tru&s;ty came; then Frank's father took off Tru&s;ty's collar. "To-morrow I'll go to the brazier's," added he, "and get a new collar made for your dog: from this day forward he &s;hall always be called after you, <HI>Frank!</HI>&mdash;And, wife, whenever any of the neighbours' children a&s;k you why the dog <HI>Tru&s;ty</HI> is to be called <HI>Frank,</HI> tell them this &s;tory of our two boys: let them know the difference between a liar and a boy of truth.</P>

<HEAD>THE ORANGE MAN; OR, THE HONEST BOY AND THE THIEF.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES was the name of the hone&s;t boy; and Ned was the name of the thief. Charles never touched what was not his own; <HI>this</HI> is being an hone&s;t boy: Ned often took what was not his own; this is being a thief. Charles's father and mother, when he was a very little boy, had taught him to be hone&s;t, by always puni&s;hing him when he meddled with what was not his own: but when Ned took what was not his own, his father and mother did not puni&s;h him; &s;o he grew up to be a thief.</P>
<P>Early one &s;ummer's morning, as Charles was going along the road to &s;chool, he met a man leading a hor&s;e which was laden with panniers. The man &s;topped at the door of a public-hou&s;e which was by the road fide; and he &s;aid to the landlord, who came to the door,
<PB N="12" REF="26">"I won't have my hor&s;e unloaded, I &s;hall only &s;top with you whil&s;t I eat my breakfa&s;t; give my hor&s;e to &s;ome one to hold here on the road, and let the hor&s;e have a little hay to eat." The landlord called, but there was no one in the way; &s;o he beckoned to Charles, who was going by, and begged him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old the hor&s;e. "Oh," &s;aid the man, "but can you engage him to be an hone&s;t boy? for the&s;e are oranges in my ba&s;kets; and it is not every little boy one can leave with oranges."&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid the landlord, "I have known Charles from the cradle upwards, and I never caught him in a lie or a theft; all the pari&s;h knows him to be an hone&s;t boy; I'll engage your oranges will be as &s;afe with him as if you were by your&s;elf."&mdash; "Can you &s;o?" &s;aid the orange man; "then I'll engage, my lad, to give you the fine&s;t orange in my ba&s;ket, when I come from break|fa&s;t, if you'll watch the red whil&s;t I am away."&mdash; "Yes," &s;aid Charles, "I <HI>will</HI> take care of your oranges." So the man put the bridle into his hand, and he went into the hou&s;e to eat his breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Charles had watched the hor&s;e and the oranges about five minutes, when he &s;aw one
<PB N="13" REF="27">of his &s;choolfellows coming towards him; as he came nearer, Charles &s;aw that it was Ned. Ned &s;topped as he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good-morrow to you, Charles; what are you doing there? who&s;e hor&s;e is that? and what have you got in the ba&s;kets?"&mdash;"There are oranges in the ba&s;kets," &s;aid Charles; "and a man, who has ju&s;t gone into the inn here to eat his breakfa&s;t, bid me take care of them, and &s;o I did; becau&s;e he &s;aid he would give me an orange when he came back again."</P>
<P>"An orange!" cried Ned; "are you to have a whole orange?&mdash;I wi&s;h I was to have one! However, let me look how large they are." Saying this, Ned went towards the pan|nier, and lifted up the cloth that covered it. "La! what fine oranges!" he exclaimed, the moment he &s;aw them. "Let me touch them to feel if they are ripe."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Charles, "you had better not; what &s;ignifies it to you whether they are ripe, you know, &s;ince you are not to eat them. You &s;hould not meddle with them, they are not yours, &mdash;you mu&s;t not touch them." "Not touch them! &s;urely," &s;aid Ned, "there's no harm in <HI>touching</HI> them. You don't think I mean to &s;teal
<PB N="14" REF="28">them, I &s;uppo&s;e." So Ned put his hand into the orange-man's ba&s;ket, and he took up an orange, and he felt it; and when he had felt it, he &s;melled it. "It &s;mells very &s;weet," &s;aid he, "and it feels very ripe; I long to ta&s;te it; I will only ju&s;t &s;uck one drop of juice at the top." Saying the&s;e words, he put the orange to his mouth.</P>
<P>Little boys, who wi&s;h to be hone&s;t, beware of temptation; do not depend too much upon your&s;elves; and remember, that it is ea&s;ier to re&s;olve to do right at fir&s;t, than at la&s;t. People are led on, by little and little, to do wrong.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ight</HI> of the oranges tempted Ned to <HI>touch</HI> them; the touch tempted him to <HI>&s;mell</HI> them; and the &s;mell tempted him to <HI>ta&s;te</HI> them.</P>
<P>"What are you about, Ned?" cried Charles, taking hold of his arm. "You &s;aid, you only wanted to &s;mell the orange; do, put it down, for &s;hame!"</P>
<P>"Don't &s;ay <HI>for &s;hame</HI> to me," cried Ned, in a &s;urly tone; the oranges are not your's, Charles!" &mdash; "No, they are not mine, but I promi&s;ed to take care of them, and &s;o I will: &mdash; &s;o put down that orange!"</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="29">
"Oh, if it comes to that, I won't," &s;aid Ned, and let us &s;ee who can make me, if I don't choo&s;e it; &mdash; I'm &s;tronger than you."</P>
<P>"I am not afraid of you for all that," re|plied Charles, "for I am in the right." Then he &s;natched the orange out of Ned's hand, and he pu&s;hed him with all his force from the ba&s;ket. Ned, immediately returning, hit him a violent blow, which almo&s;t &s;tunned him. Still, how|ever, this good boy, without minding the pain, per&s;evered in defending what was left in his care; he &s;till held the bridle with one hand, and covered the ba&s;ket with his other arm, as well as he could. Ned &s;truggled in vain, to get his hands into the pannier again; he could not; and, finding that he could not win by &s;trength, he had recour&s;e to cunning. So he pretended to be out of breath and to de&s;i&s;t; but he meant, as &s;oon as Charles looked away, to creep &s;oftly round to the ba&s;ket, on the other &s;ide. Cunning people, though they think them&s;elves very wi&s;e, are almo&s;t always very &s;illy.</P>
<P>Ned, intent upon one thing, the getting round to &s;teal the oranges, forgot that if he went too clo&s;e to the hor&s;e's heels, he &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="30">&s;tartle him. The hor&s;e indeed, di&s;turbed by the bu&s;tle near him, had already left off eating his hay, and began to put down his ears; but when he felt &s;omething touch his hind legs, he gave a &s;udden kick, and Ned fell backwards, ju&s;t as he had &s;eized the orange.</P>
<P>Ned &s;creamed with the pain; and at the &s;cream all the people came out of the public hou&s;e to &s;ee what was the matter; and among&s;t them came the orange-man.</P>
<P>Ned was now &s;o much a&s;hamed, that he almo&s;t forgot the pain, and wi&s;hed to run away; but he was &s;o much hurt, that he was obliged to &s;it down again. The truth of the matter was &s;oon told by Charles, and as &s;oon believed by all the people pre&s;ent who knew him: for he had the character of being an hone&s;t boy, and Ned was known to be a thief and a liar.</P>
<P>So nobody pitied Ned for the pain he felt. "He de&s;erves it," &s;ays one. "Why did he meddle with what was not his own?" &mdash;"Pugh! he is not much hurt, I'll an&s;wer for it," &s;aid another. "And if he was, it's a lucky kick for him, if it keeps him from the gallows," &s;ays a third. Charles was the only per&s;on who &s;aid nothing; he helped Ned away to a bank. For brave boys are always good-natured.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="31">
"Oh, come here," &s;aid the orange-man, calling him; "come here, my hone&s;t lad! what! you got that black eye in keeping my oranges, did you? &mdash; that's a flout little fellow," &s;aid he, taking him by the hand, and leading him into the mid&s;t of the people. Men, wo|men, and children, had gathered around, and all the children fixed their eyes upon Charles, and wi&s;hed to be in his place.</P>
<P>In the mean time the orange man took Charles's hat off his head, and filled it with fine China oranges. "There, my little friend," &s;aid he, "take them, and God ble&s;s you with them! If I could but afford it, you &s;hould have all that is in my ba&s;ket."</P>
<P>Then the people, and e&s;pecially the children, &s;houted for joy; but as &s;oon as there was &s;ilence, Charles &s;aid to the orange-man, "Thank's, ma&s;ter, with all my heart; but I can't take your oranges, only that one I earned; take the re&s;t back again: as for a black eye, that's no|thing! but I won't be paid for it; no more than for doing what's hone&s;t. So I can't take your oranges, ma&s;ter; but I thank you as much as if I had them." Saying the&s;e words, Charles offered to pour the oranges back into the ba&s;ket, bat the man would not let him.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="32">
"Then," &s;aid Charles, "if they are hone&s;tly mine, I may give them away;" &s;o he emptied the hat among&s;t the children his companions. "Divide them among&s;t you," &s;aid he; and without waiting for their thanks, he pre&s;&s;ed through the crowd, and ran towards home. The children all followed him, clapping their hands, and thanking him.</P>
<P>The little thief came limping after. Nobody prai&s;ed him, nobody thanked him; he had no oranges to eat, nor had he any to give away. <HI>People mu&s;t be hone&s;t, before they can be generous.</HI> Ned &s;ighed as he went towards home; "And all this," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "was for one orange; it was not worth while." No. It is never worth while to do wrong. Little boys who read this &s;tory, con&s;ider which would you rather have been, <HI>the hone&s;t boy,</HI> or <HI>the thief.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TARLTON.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Hardy was educated by Mr. Free|man, a very good ma&s;ter, at one of the Sunday &s;chools in &mdash;&s;hire. He was hone&s;t, obedient, active, and good-natured; &s;o that he was e&s;|teemed and beloved by his ma&s;ter, and by his companions. Beloved by all his companions who were good, he did not de&s;ire to be loved by the bad; nor was he at all vexed or a&s;hamed, when idle, mi&s;chievous, or di&s;hone&s;t boys at|tempted to plague or ridicule him. His friend Loveit, on the contrary, wi&s;hed to be univer|&s;ally liked; and his highe&s;t ambition was to be thought the be&s;t natured boy in the &s;chool:&mdash; and &s;o he was. He u&s;ually went by the name of <HI>poor Loveit,</HI> and every body pitied him when he got into di&s;grace, which he frequently did; for though he had a good di&s;po&s;ition, he was often led to do things, which he knew to be wrong, merely becau&s;e he could never have the courage to &s;ay, <HI>no;</HI> becau&s;e he was afraid to offend the ill-natured, and could not bear to be laughed at by fools.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="34">
One fine autumn evening, all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a plea&s;ant green meadow, near the &s;chool. Loveit, and another boy, called Tarlton, began to play a game at battledore and &s;huttlecock, and a large party &s;tood by to look on; for they were the be&s;t players at battledore and &s;huttlecock in the &s;chool, and this was a trial of &s;kill between them. When they had kept it up to three hundred and twenty, the game became very in|tere&s;ting: the arms of the combatants grew &s;o tired, that they could &s;carcely wield the battle|dores: &mdash;the &s;huttlecock began to waver in the air; now it almo&s;t touched the ground, and now, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectators, mounted again high over their heads; yet the &s;trockes became fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bler and feebler; and "now Loveit!" "now Tarlton!" re&s;ounded on all &s;ides. For another minute the victory was doubtful; but at length, the &s;etting &s;un &s;hining full in Loveit's face &s;o dazzled his eyes, that he could no longer &s;ee the &s;huttlecock, and it fell at his feet.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t &s;hout for Tarlton's triumph was over, every body exclaimed, "Poor Loveit!" &mdash;he's the be&s;t natured fellow in the world!&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="35">what a pity that he did not &s;tand with his black to the &s;un."</P>
<P>"Now I dare you all to play another game with me," cried Tarlton, vauntingly; and as he &s;poke, he to&s;&s;ed the &s;huttlecock up with all his force: with &s;o much force, that it went over the hedge, and dropped into a lane, which went clo&s;e be&s;ide the field. "Hey-day!" &s;aid Tarl|ton, "what &s;hall we do now?"</P>
<P>The boys were &s;trictly forbidden to go into the lane; and it was upon their promi&s;e not to break this command, that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field.</P>
<P>No other &s;huttlecock was to be had, and their play was &s;topped. They &s;tood on the top of the bank peeping over the hedge. "I &s;ee it yonder," &s;aid Tarlton; "I wi&s;h any body would get it. One could get over the gate at the bottom of the field, and be back again in half a minute," added he, looking at Loveit. "But you know we mu&s;t not go into the lane," &s;aid Loveit, he&s;itatingly. "Pugh!" &s;aid Tarl|ton, "why now what harm could it do?"&mdash; "I don't know," &s;aid Loveit, drumming upon his battledore; "but&mdash;" "You don't know, man! why then what are you afraid of? I a&s;k
<PB N="22" REF="36">you."&mdash;Loveit coloured, went on drumming, and again, in a lower voice, &s;aid <HI>"he didn't know."</HI> But upon Tarlton's repeating, in a more in&s;olent tone, "I a&s;k you, man, what you're afraid of?" he &s;uddenly left off drum|ming, and looking round, &s;aid, "he was not afraid of any thing that he knew of."&mdash;"Yes, but you are," &s;aid Hardy, coming forward. "Am I," &s;aid Loveit; "of what, pray, am I afraid?" "Of doing wrong!" "Afraid <HI>of doing wrong!"</HI> repeated Tarlton, mimicking him, &s;o that he made every body laugh. "Now hadn't you better &s;ay, afraid of being flogged?" &mdash;"No," &s;aid Hardy, coolly, after the laugh had &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, "I am as little afraid of being flogged as you are, Tarlton; but I meant&mdash;" "No matter what you meant; why &s;hould you interfere with your wi&s;dom, and your meanings; nobody thought of a&s;king <HI>you</HI> to &s;tir a &s;tep for us; but we a&s;ked Loveit, be|cau&s;e he's the be&s;t fellow in the world."&mdash;"And for that very rea&s;on you &s;hould not a&s;k him, becau&s;e you know he can't refu&s;e you any thing?" "Indeed though," cried Loveit, piqued, "<HI>there</HI> you're mi&s;taken, for I could refu&s;e if I cho&s;e it." Hardy &s;miled; and Loveit,
<PB N="23" REF="37">half afraid of his contempt, and half afraid of Tarlton's ridicule, &s;tood doubtful, and again had recour&s;e to his battledore, which he ba|lanced mo&s;t curiou&s;ly upon his fore finger. "Look at him!&mdash;now do look at him!" cried Tarlton; "did you ever in your life &s;ee any body look &s;o &s;illy!&mdash;Hardy has him quite under thumb; he's &s;o mortally afraid of Par&s;on Prig, that he dare not, for the &s;oul of him, turn ei|ther of his eyes from the tip of his no&s;e; look how he &s;quints!"&mdash;"I don't &s;quint," &s;aid Loveit, looking up, "and nobody has me under his thumb; and what Hardy &s;aid, was only for fear I &s;hould get into di&s;grace:&mdash;he's the be&s;t friend I have." Loveit &s;poke this with more than u&s;ual &s;pirit, for both his heart and his pride were touched. "Come along them," &s;aid Hardy, taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner; and he was ju&s;t going, when Tarl|ton called after him, "Ay, go along with its be&s;t friend, and take care it does not get into a &s;crape;&mdash;good by, Little Panado!"&mdash;"Who do they call Little Panado," &s;aid Loveit, turn|ing his head ha&s;tily back. "Never mind," &s;aid Hardy, "what does it &s;ignify?"&mdash;"No," &s;aid Loveit, "to be &s;ure it does not &s;ignify;
<PB N="24" REF="38">but one does not like to be called Little Pa|nado: be&s;ides," added he, after going a few &s;teps farther, "they'll all think it &s;o ill-natured. &mdash;I had better go back, and ju&s;t tell them, that I'm very &s;orry I can't get their &s;huttlecock;&mdash; do come back with me."&mdash; <Q>No, &s;aid Hardy, I can't go back; and you'd better not.</Q> "But, I a&s;&s;ure you, I won't &s;tay a minute; wait for me," added Loveit; and he &s;lunk back again to prove that he was not Little Pa|nado.</P>
<P>Once returned, the re&s;t followed of cour&s;e; for to &s;upport his character for good-nature, he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions, and to &s;hew his &s;pirit, leapt over the gate, amid&s;t the acclamations of the little mob:&mdash;he was quickly out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>"Here," cried he, returning in about five minutes, quite out of breath, "I've got the &s;huttlecock; and I'll tell you what I've &s;een," cried he, panting for breath. "What?" cried every body, eagerly. "Why, ju&s;t at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane," panting. "Well," &s;aid Tariton, impatiently, "do go on."&mdash;"Let me ju&s;t take breath fir&s;t." "Pugh! never mind your breath."&mdash;"Well then, ju&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="39">at the turn of the corner, at the end of the lane, as I was looking about for the &s;huttlecock, I heard a great ru&s;tling &s;omewhere near-me, and &s;o I looked where it could come from; and I &s;aw, in a nice little garden, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the way, a boy, about as big as Tarlton, &s;itting in a great tree, &s;haking the branches; and at every &s;hake down there came &s;uch a &s;hower of &s;ine large ro&s;y apples, they made my mouth water: &s;o I called to the boy, to beg one; but he &s;aid, he could not give me one, for that they were his grandfather's; and ju&s;t at that minute, from behind a goo&s;eberry bu&s;h, up popped the uncle&mdash;the grandfather poked his head out of the window; &s;o I ran off as fa&s;t as my legs would carry me, though I heard him bawling after me all the way."</P>
<P>"And let him bawl," cried Tarlton, "he &s;han't bawl for nothing; I'm determined we'll have &s;ome of his fine large ro&s;y apples before I &s;leep to-night."&mdash;At this &s;peech a general &s;ilence en&s;ued; every body kept their eyes fixed upon Tarlton, except Loveit, who looked down, apprehen&s;ive that he &s;hould be drawn on much farther than he intended.&mdash;"Oh, indeed!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "as Hardy told me, I had better not have come back!"</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="40">
Regardle&s;s of this confu&s;ion, Tarlton conti|nued, "But before I &s;ay any more, I hope we have no &s;pies among&s;t us.

<P>"Well then," cried Tarlton, giving his hand to the boy next him, then to the next, "your word and honour that you won't betray me; but &s;tand by me, and I'il &s;tand by you."&mdash;Each boy gave his hand, and his promi&s;e; repeating "&s;tand by me, and I'll &s;tand by you."&mdash;Loveit hung back till the la&s;t; and had almo&s;t twi&s;ted off the butten of the boy's coat who &s;ereened him, when Tarlton came up, holding out his hand, "Come, Loveit, lad, you're in for it: Stand by me, and I'll &s;tand by you."&mdash;" In|deed, Tarlton," expo&s;tulated he, without look|ing him in the &s;ace, "I do wi&s;h you'd give up this &s;eheme; I dare &s;ay all the apples are gone by this time;&mdash;I wi&s;h you would&mdash;Do, pray, give up this &s;cheme."&mdash;"What &s;eheme, man! you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t heard it yet; you may as well know

"Why I don't know you, I declare I don't know you to-day," &s;aid Tarlton; "you u&s;ed to be the be&s;t natured, mo&s;t agreeable lad in the world, and would do any thing one a&s;ked you; but you're quite al|tered of late, as we were &s;aying ju&s;t now, when you &s;kulked away with Hardy: come, do man, pluck up a little &s;pirit, and be one of us, or you'll make us all <HI>have you.</HI>" "<HI>Hate</HI> me!" repeated Loveit, with terror; "no, &s;urely, you won't all <HI>Hate</HI> me!" and he mechanically &s;tretched out his hand, which Tarlton &s;hook violently, &s;aying, "Ay, now, that's right."&mdash; "Ay, now, that's wren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!" whi&s;pered Loveit's con&s;cience; but his con&s;cience was of no u&s;e to him, for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers; and though he had the wi&s;h, he never had the power, to do right. "Poor Loveit! I knew he would not refu&s;e us," cried his companions; and even Tarlton. the mo|ment he &s;hook hands with him, de&s;pi&s;ed him. It is certain, that weakne&s;s of mind is de&s;pi&s;ed both by the good and by the bad.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="42">
The league being thus formed, Tarlton a&s;|&s;umed all the airs of a commander, explained his &s;chemes, and laid the plan of attack, upon the poor old man's apple tree. It was the only one he had in the world. We &s;hall not dwell upon their confultation, for the amu&s;ement of contriving &s;uch expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them.</P>
<P>There was a &s;mall window at the end of the back &s;tairea&s;e, through which, between nine and ten o'clock at night, Tarlton, accompanied by Loveit and another boy, crept out. It was a moonlight night, and, after cro&s;&s;ing the field, and climbing the gate, directed by Loveit, who now re&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to go through the affair with &s;pi|rit, they proceeded down the lane with ra&s;h, yet fearful &s;hops. At a di&s;tance Loveit &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w the write-wa&s;hed cottage, and the apple tree be&s;ide it: they quickened their pace, and with &s;ome difficulty &s;crambled through the hedge which fenced the garden, though not without being &s;cratched and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by the briars. Every thing was &s;ilent. Yet now and then at every ru&s;tling of the leaves they &s;tarted, and their hearts beat violently. Once as Loveit was climbing the apple tree, he thought he heard a door in the
<PB N="29" REF="43">cottage open, and earne&s;tly begged his com|panions to de&s;i&s;t and return home. This how|ever he could, by no means, per&s;uade them to do, until they had filled their pockets with ap|ples; then, to his great joy, they returned, crept in at the &s;tairca&s;e window, and each re|tired, as &s;oftly as po&s;&s;ible, to his own apart|ment.</P>
<P>Love it &s;lept in the room with Hardy, whom he had left ta&s;t a&s;leep, and whom he now was extremely afraid of wakening. All the apples were emptied out of Loverit's pockets, and lodged with Tarlton till the morning, for fear the &s;mell &s;hould betray the &s;ecret to Hardy. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oom door was apt to creak, but it was opened with &s;uch precaution, that no noi&s;e could be heard, and Loveit found his friend as fa&s;t a&s;leep as when he left him.</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "how quietly he &s;leeps! I wi&s;h I had been &s;leeping too." The reproaches of Loveit's con&s;cience, however, &s;erved no other purpo&s;e but to torment him; he had not &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to be good. The very next night, in &s;pite of all his fears, and all his penitence, and all his re&s;olutions, by a little fre&s;h ridicule and per&s;ua&s;ion he was in|duced
<PB N="30" REF="44">to accompany the &s;ame party on a &s;imilar expedition. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the nece&s;|&s;ity for continuing their depredations became &s;tronger the third day; for, though at fir&s;t only a &s;mall party had been in the &s;ecret, by degrees it was divulged to the whole &s;chool; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure &s;ecre&s;y by &s;haring the booty.</P>
<P>Every one was a&s;toni&s;hed, that Hardy, with all his quickne&s;s and penetration, had not yet di&s;covered their proceedings; but Loveit could not help &s;u&s;pecting that he was not quite &s;o ig|norant as he appeared to be. Loveit had &s;trictly kept his promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y, but he was by no means an artful boy; and in talking to his friend, con&s;cious that he had &s;omething to con|ceal, he was perpetually on the point of betray|ing him&s;elf; then recollecting his engagement, he blu&s;hed, &s;tammered, bungled; and upon Hardy's a&s;king what he meant, would an&s;wer with a filly guilty countenance, that he did not know; or abruptly break off, &s;aying, Oh no|thing! nothing at all!</P>
<P>It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to per|mit him to con&s;ult his friend; a gloom over|&s;pread Tarlton's brow when he began to &s;peak on the &s;ubject, and he always returned a pe|remptory
<PB N="31" REF="45">refu&s;al, accompanied with &s;ome &s;uch taunting expre&s;&s;ion as this&mdash;"I wi&s;h we had nothing to do with &s;uch a &s;neaking &s;ellow. He'll betray us all, I &s;ee, before we have done with him."&mdash;"Well," &s;aid Loveit to him&s;elf, "&s;o I am abu&s;ed after all, and called a &s;neaking fellow for my pains; that's rather hard to be &s;ure, when l've got &s;o little by the job."</P>
<P>In truth he had not got much, for in the di|vi&s;ion of the booty only one apple, and a half of another which was only half ripe, happened to fall to his &s;hare; though, to be &s;ure, when they had all eaten their apples, he had the &s;a|tisfaction to hear every body declare they were very &s;orry they had forgotten to offer &s;ome of theirs to <HI>"poor Loveit!"</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the vi&s;its to the apple tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man, who lived in the cottage. He u&s;ed to examine his only tree very frequently, and mi&s;&s;ing numbers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;y apples which he had watched ripening, he, though not much prome to &s;u&s;picion, began to think that there was &s;omething going wrong; e&s;pecially as a gap was made in his hedge, and there were &s;everal &s;mall foot&s;teps in his flower beds.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="46">
The good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature, much le&s;s to children, of whom he was particularly fond. Nor was he in the lea&s;t avaricious, for though he was not rich, he had enough to live upon, becau&s;e he had been very indu&s;trious in his youth; and he was always very ready to part with the little he had; nor^t was he a cro&s;s old man. If any thing would have made him angry, it would have been the &s;eeing his fa|vourite tree ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bed, as he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of gaving his red apples to his grand|children on his birth-day. However he looked up at the tree in &s;orrow rather than in anger, and leaning upon his &s;taff, he began to con|&s;ider what he had be&s;t do.</P>
<P>"If I complain to their ma&s;ter," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "they will certainly be flogged, and that I &s;hould be &s;orry for; yet they mu&s;t not be let to go on &s;tealing, that would be wor&s;e &s;till, for that would &s;urely bring them to the gallows in the end. Let me &s;ee&mdash;oh, ay, that will do; I will borrow farmer Kent's dog Barker, he'll keep them off, I'll an&s;wer for it."</P>
<P>Father Kent lent his dog Barker, cautioning his neighbour at the &s;ame time, to be &s;ure to
<PB N="33" REF="47">chain him well, for he was the fierce&s;t ma&s;tiff in England. The old man, with farmer Kent's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, chained him fa&s;t to the trunk of the apple tree.</P>
<P>Night came, and Tarlton, Loveit, and his companions, returned at the u&s;ual hour. Grown bolder now by frequent &s;ucce&s;s, they came on talking and laughing. But the moment they had &s;et their &s;oot in the garden, the dog &s;tarted up; and, &s;haking his chain as he &s;prang forward, barked with unremitting fury. They &s;tood &s;till as if fixed to the &s;pot. There was ju&s;t moonlight enough to &s;ee the dog. "Let us try the other &s;ide of the tree," &s;aid Tarlton. But to which ever &s;ide they turned the dog flew round in an in&s;tant, barking with encrea&s;ed fury.</P>
<P>"He'll break his chain and tear us to pieces," cried Tarlton; and, &s;truck with ter or, he immediately threw down the ba&s;ket he had brought with him, and betook him&s;elf to flight with the greate&s;t precipitation. &mdash; "Help me! oh, pray, help me! I cant't get through the he ge," cried Loveit in a lamentable tone, whil&s;t the dog growled hideou&s;ly, and &s;prang forward to the extremity of his chain. &mdash; "I
<PB N="34" REF="48">can't get out! Oh, for God's &s;ake, &s;tay for me one minute, dear Tarlton!"</P>
<P>He called in vain, he was left to &s;truggle through his difficulties by him&s;elf; and of all his dear friends, not one turned back to help him. At la&s;t, torn and terrified, he got through the hedge and ran home, de&s;pi&s;ing his compa|nions for their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Nor could he help ob&s;erving, that Tarlton, with all his vaunted prowe&s;s, was the fir&s;t to run away from the appearance of danger The next morning he could not help reproaching the party with their conduct. &mdash; "Why could not you, any of you, &s;tay one minute to help me?" &s;aid he. "We did not hear you call," an&s;wered one. "I was &s;o frightened," &s;aid another, "I would not have turned back for the whole world." &mdash; "And you, Tarlton?" &mdash; "I," &s;aid Tarlton. "Had not I enough to do to take care of my&s;elf, you blockhead? Every one for him&s;elf in this world!" "So I &s;ee," &s;aid Loveit gravely. "Well, man! is there any thing &s;trange in that" &mdash; "Strange! why yes, I thought you all loved me?" "Lord, love you, lad! &s;o we do; but we love our&s;elves better." &mdash; "Hardy would not have &s;erved me &s;o, however," &s;aid
<PB N="35" REF="49">Loveit, turning away in di&s;gu&s;t. Tarlton was alarmed. &mdash; "Pugh!" &s;aid he; "what non&s;en&s;e have you taken into your brain? Think no more about it. We are all very &s;orry, and beg your pardon; come, &s;hake hands, for give and forget." Loveit gave his hand, but gave it rather coldly. &mdash; "I forgive it with all my heart," &s;aid he, "but I cannot forget it &s;o &s;oon!" &mdash; "Why then you are not &s;uch a good-humoured follow as we thought you were. Surely you cannot bear malice, Loveit." Loveit &s;miled, and allowed that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> certainly could not bear malice. "Well then, come; you know at the bottom we all love you, and would do any thing in the world for you." Poor Loveit, flattered in his foible, began to believe that they did love him at the bottom, as they &s;aid, and even with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eyes open con&s;ented again to be duped.</P>
<P>"How &s;trange it is," thought he, "that I &s;hould &s;et &s;uch value upon the love of tho&s;e I de&s;pi&s;e! When I'm once out of this &s;crape, I'll have no more to do with them, I'm deter|mined."</P>
<P>Compared with his friend Hardy, his new a&s;&s;ociates did indeed appear contemptible; for
<PB N="36" REF="50">all this time Hardy had treated him with uni|form kindne&s;s, avoided to pry into his &s;ecrets, yet &s;eemed ready to receive his confidence, if it had been offered.</P>
<P>After &s;chool in the evening, as he was &s;tand|ing &s;ilently be&s;ide Hardy, who was ruling a &s;heet of paper for him, Tarlton, in his brutal manner, came up, and &s;eizing him by the arm, cried, "Come along with me, Loveit, I've &s;omething to &s;ay to you." &mdash; "I can't come now," &s;aid Loveit, drawing away his arm. &mdash;"Ah, do come now," &s;aid Tarlton in a voice of per&s;ua&s;ion. &mdash; "Well, I'll come pre&s;ently." &mdash; "Nay, but do, pray; there's a good fellow, come now, becau&s;e I've &s;omething to &s;ay to you." &mdash; "What is it you've got to &s;ay to me? I wi&s;h you'd let me alone," &s;aid Loveit; yet at the &s;ame time he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led away.</P>
<P>Tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again; and even, though he was not very apt to part with his play-things, went &s;o far as to &s;ay, "Loveit, the other day you wanted a top; I'll give you mine, if you de&s;ire it." &mdash; Loveit thanked him, and was overjoyed at the thoughts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="37" REF="51">this top. "But what did you want to &s;ay to me ju&s;t now?" &mdash; "Aye, we'll talk of that pre|&s;ently &mdash; not yet &mdash; when we get out of hearing." &mdash; "Nobody is near us," &s;aid Loveit. &mdash; "Come a little farther, however," &s;aid Tarlton, look|ing round &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly &mdash; "Well now, well?" "You know the dog that frightened us &s;o la&s;t night?" &mdash; "Yes." &mdash; "It will never frighten us again." &mdash; "Won't it? how &s;o?" &mdash; "Look here," &s;aid Tarlton, drawing from his pocket &s;omething wrapped in a blue handkerchief. &mdash; "What's that?" Tarlton opened it. "Raw meat!" exclaimed Loveit. "How came you by it?" &mdash; "Tom, the &s;ervant boy, Tom got it for me, and I'm to give him &s;ixpence." &mdash; "And is it for the dog?" &mdash; "Yes; I vowed I'd be re|venged on him, and after this he'll never bark again." &mdash; "Never bark again! &mdash; What do you mean? &mdash; Is it poi&s;on?' exclaimed Loveit, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing back with horror. "Only poi&s;on for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">," &s;aid Tarlton, confu&s;ed; "you could not look more &s;hocking if it was poi&s;on for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">." Loveit &s;tood for nearly a minute in profound &s;ilence. "Tarlton," &s;aid he, at la&s;ts in a changed tone and altered manner, "I did not know you; I will have no more to do
<PB N="38" REF="52">with you." &mdash; "Nay, but &s;tay," &s;aid Tarlton, catching hold of his arm, "&s;tay; I was only joking." &mdash; "Let go my arm, you were in ear|ne&s;t." &mdash; "But then that was before I knew there was any harm. If you think there's any harm?" &mdash; "<HI>If,</HI>" &s;aid Loveit. "Why you know, I might not know; for Tom told me it's a thing that's often done; a&s;k Tom." &mdash; "I'll a&s;k nobody! Surely we know better what's right and wrong than Tom does." &mdash; "But only ju&s;t a&s;k him, to hear what he'll &s;ay." &mdash; "I dont' want to hear what he'll &s;ay," cried Loveit vehemently. "The dog will die in agonies &mdash; in horrid agonies! There was a dog poi&s;oned at my father's, I &s;aw him in the yard. &mdash; Poor creature! he lay, and howled, and writhed him&s;elf!" &mdash; "Poor creature! &mdash; Well, there's no harm done now," cried Tarlton, in an hypocritical tone. But though he thought &s;it to di&s;&s;emble with Loveit, he was thoroughly determined in his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor Loveit, in ha&s;te to get away, returned to his friend Hardy; but his mind was in &s;uch agitation, that he neither talked nor moved like him&s;elf; and two or three times his heart was &s;o full that he was ready to bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="53">
"How good-natured you are to me," &s;aid he to Hardy, as he was trying vainly to entertain him; "but if you knew&mdash;." Here he &s;topped &s;hort, for the bell for evening prayer rang, and they all took their places, and knelt down. After prayers, as they were going to bed, Loveit &s;topped Tarlton&mdash;<HI>"Well!"</HI> a&s;ked he, in an inquiring manner, fixing his eyes upon him;&mdash; <HI>"Well!"</HI> replied Tarlton, in an audacious tone, as if he meant to &s;et his inquiring eye at defiance; &mdash; "what do you mean to do to night?"&mdash;"To go to &s;leep, as you do, I &s;up|po&s;e," I plied Tarlton, turning away abruptly, and whi&s;tling as he walked off.</P>
<P>"Oh, he has certainly changed his mind!" &s;aid Leveit to him&s;elf, "el&s;e he could not whi&s;tle." About t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n minutes after this, as he and Herdy were undre&s;&s;ing, Hardy &s;uddenly re|collected that he had left his new kite out upon the gra&s;s. "Oh," &s;aid he, "it will be quite &s;poiled before morning!"&mdash;"Call Tom," &s;aid Loveit, "and bid him bring it in for you in a minute." They both went to the top of the &s;tairs to call Tom; no one an&s;wered. They called again louder. "Is Tom below?"&mdash; "I'm here," an&s;wered he at la&s;t, coming out
<PB N="40" REF="54">of Tarlton's room with a look of mixed embar|ra&s;&s;ment and effrontery. And as he was re|ceiving Hardy's commi&s;&s;ion, Loveit &s;aw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket. This excited fre&s;h &s;u&s;picions in Loveit's mind; but, without &s;aying one word, he immediately &s;tationed him&s;elf at the window in his room, which looked out towards the lane; and, as the moon was ri&s;en, he could &s;ee if any one pa&s;&s;ed that way. "What are you doing there?" &s;aid Hardy, after he had been watching &s;ome time; why don't you come to bed?" Loveit returned no an&s;wer, but continued &s;tand|ing at the window. Nor did he watch long in vain; pre&s;ently he &s;aw Tom gliding &s;lowly along a by-path, and get over the gate into the lane.</P>
<P>"He's gone to do it!" exclaimed Loveit aloud, with an emotion which he could not command. "Who's gone! to do what!" cried Hardy, &s;tarting up. "How cruel, how wicked!" continued Loveit. "What's cruel &mdash;what's wicked? &s;peak out at once!" re|turned Hardy, in that commanding tone which, in moments of danger, &s;trong minds feel them|&s;elves entitled to a&s;&s;ume towards weak ones.
<PB N="41" REF="55">Loveit in&s;tantly, though in an incoherent man|ner, explained the affair to him. Scarcely had the words pa&s;&s;ed his lips, when Hardy &s;prang up, and began dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf without &s;aying one &s;yllable. "For God's &s;ake, what are you go|ing to do?" &s;aid Loveit in great anxiety. "They'll never forgive me! don't betray me! they'll never forgive me! pray &s;peak to me! only &s;ay you won't betray us."&mdash;"I will not betray you, tru&s;t to me," &s;aid Hardy; and he left the room, and Loveit &s;tood in amazement: whil&s;t, in the mean time, Hardy, in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided, ran with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed acro&s;s the meadow, and then down the lane. He came up with Tom ju&s;t as he was climbing the bank into the old man's garden. Hardy, too mu~ch out of breath to &s;peak, &s;eized hold of him, dragged him down, detaining him with a firm gra&s;p whil&s;t he panted for utterance&mdash; "What, ma&s;ter Hardy, is it you? what's the matter? what do you want?"&mdash;"I want the poi&s;oned meat that you have in your pocket." &mdash;"Who told you that I had any &s;uch thing," &s;aid Tom, clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket. "Give it me quietly, and I'll let you
<PB N="42" REF="56">off."&mdash;"Sir, upon my word I hav'n't? I didn't? I don't know what you mean," &s;aid Tom trembling, though he was by far the &s;tronge&s;t of the two; "indeed I don't know what you mean."&mdash;"You do," &s;aid Hardy, with great indignation, and a violent &s;truggle immediately commenced. The dog, now alarmed by the voices, began to bark outrage|ou&s;ly. Tom was terrified le&s;t the old man &s;hould come out to &s;ee what was the matter; his &s;trength for&s;ook him, and flinging the hand|kerchief and meat over the hedge, he ran away with all his &s;peed. The handkerchief fell with|in the reach of the dog, who in&s;tantly &s;happed at it: luckily it did not come untied. Hardy &s;aw a pitchfork on a dunghill clo&s;e be&s;ide him, and &s;eizing upon it, &s;tuck it into the handker|chief. The dog pull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, tore, growled, grappled, yelled; it was impo&s;&s;ible to get the handker|chief from between his teeth; but the knot was loo&s;ed, the meat unperceived by the dog drop|ped out, and while he dragged off the hand|kerchief in triumph, Hardy with inexpre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le joy plunged the pitchfork into the poi&s;oned meat, and bore it away.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="57">
Never did hero retire with more &s;atisfaction from a field of battle. Full of the plea&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;sful benevolence, Hardy tripped joyfully home, and vaulted over the window-fill, when the fir&s;t object he beheld was Mr. Power, the u&s;her, &s;tanding at the head of the &s;tairs, with his candle in his hand.</P>
<P>"Come up, whoever you are," &s;aid Mr. William Power in a &s;tern voice; I thought I &s;hould find you out at la&s;t. Come up, who|ever you are!" Hardy obeyed without reply.&mdash; "Hardy!" exclaimed Mr. Power, &s;tarting back with a&s;toni&s;hment; "is it you, Mr. Har|dy?" repeated he, holding the light to his face. "Why, Sir, &s;aid he in a &s;neering tone, "I'm &s;ure, if Mr. Trueman was here, he wouldn't believe his own eyes; but for my part, I &s;aw through you long &s;ince, I never liked &s;aints for my &s;hare.

"Why don't you &s;peak?" cried he, &s;haking him by the &s;houlder impatiently. Still Hardy was &s;ilent. "Down upon your knees this minute, and con|fe&s;s all, tell me where you've been, what you've been doing, and who are your accomplices, for I know there is a gang of you: &s;o," added he, pre&s;&s;ing heavily upon Hardy's &s;houlder, "down upon your knees this minute, and confe&s;s the whole, that's your only way now to get off your&s;elf. If you hope for <HI>my</HI> pardon, I can tell you it's not to be had without a&s;king for."&mdash;"Sir," &s;aid Hardy, in a firm but re&s;pectful voice, "I have no pardon to a&s;k, I have nothing to confe&s;s, I am innocent; but if I were not, I would never try to get off my&s;elf by betraying my companions."&mdash;"Very well, Sir! very well! very fine! &s;tick to it, &s;tick to it, I advi&s;e you&mdash; and we &s;hall &s;ee. And how will you look to|morrow, Mr. Innocent, when my uncle the Doctor comes home?" "As I do now, Sir," &s;aid Hardy, unmoved. His compo&s;ure threw Mr. Power into a rage too great for utterance.
<PB N="45" REF="59">"Sir," continued Hardy, "ever &s;ince I have been at &s;chool, I never told a lie, and therefore, Sir, I hope you will believe me now. Upon my word and honour, Sir, I have done nothing wrong."&mdash;"Nothing wrong? Better and bet|ter! what, when I catched you going out at night?"&mdash;"<HI>That</HI> to be &s;ure was wrong," &s;aid Hardy, recollecting him&s;elf; "but except that&mdash;" "Except that, Sir! I will except no|thing. Come along with me, young gentle|man, your time for pardon is pa&s;t." Saying the&s;e words, he pulled Hardy along a narrow pa&s;&s;age to a &s;mall clo&s;et, &s;et apart for de&s;perate offenders, and u&s;ually known by the name of the <HI>Black Hole.</HI> "There, Sir, take up your lodging there for to-night," &s;aid he, pu&s;hing him in; "to-morrow I'll know more, or I'll know why," added he, double locking the door, with a tremendous noi&s;e, upon his pri&s;oner, and lock|ing al&s;o the door at the end of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that no one could have acce&s;s to him. "So now I think I have you &s;afe!" &s;aid Mr. Wil|liam Power to him&s;elf, &s;talking off with &s;teps which made the whole gallery re&s;ound, and which made many a guilty heart tremble. The conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between
<PB N="46" REF="60">Hardy and Mr. Power at the head of the &s;tairs had been anxiou&s;ly li&s;tened to, but only a word or two here and there had been di&s;tinctly over|heard. The locking of the black hole door was a terrible &s;ound&mdash;&s;ome knew not what it portended, and others, knew <HI>too well;</HI> all a&s;&s;em|bled in the morring with faces of anxiety. Tarlton's and Loveit's were the mo&s;t agitated. Tarlton for him&s;elf; Loveit for his friend, for him&s;elf, for every body. Every one of the party, and Tarlton at their head, &s;urrounded him with reproaches; and con&s;idered him as the author of the evils which hung over them. "How could you do &s;o? and why did you &s;ay any thing to Hardy about it? when you had promi&s;ed too! Oh what &s;hall we all do! what a &s;erape you have brought us into! Loveit, it's all your fault!"&mdash;<HI>"All my fault!"</HI> repeated poor Loveit, with a &s;igh; "well, that is hard."</P>
<P>"Goodne&s;s! there's the bell," exclaimed a number of voices at once. "Now for it!" They all &s;tood in a half circle for morning prayers! they li&s;tened, "Here he is coming! No&mdash;Yes&mdash;Here he is!" And Mr. William Power, with a gloomy brow, appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room.
<PB N="47" REF="61">They knelt down to prayers, and the moment they ro&s;e Mr. William Power, laying his hand upon the table, cried, "Stand &s;till, gentlemen, if you plea&s;e." Every body &s;tood &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k &s;till; he walked out of the circle; they gue&s;&s;ed that he was gone for Hardy, and the whole room was in commotion.

"I'll an&s;wer for it he has told of all of us," &s;aid Tarlton. "And I'll an&s;wer for it he has told of none of us," an&s;wered Loveit, with a &s;igh. "You don't think he's &s;uch a fool, when he can get him&s;elf off," &s;aid Tarlton.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant the pri&s;oner was led in, and as he pa&s;&s;ed through the circle, every eye was fixed upon him; his eye turned upon no one, not even upon Loveit, who pulled him by the coat as he pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;every one felt almo&s;t afraid to breathe.&mdash;"Well, Sir," &s;aid Mr. Power, &s;itting down in Mr. Trueman's ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow chair, and placing the pri&s;oner oppo&s;ite to him; "well, Sir, what have you to &s;ay to me this morning?" &mdash;"Nothing, Sir," an&s;wered Hardy, in a de|cided yet mode&s;t manner; "nothing but what

He leaned upon his &s;tick as he walked, and in his other hand carried a ba&s;ket of apples. When they came within the circle, Mr. Trueman &s;topped &s;hort&mdash; "Hardy!" exclaimed he, with a voice of un|&s;eigned &s;urpri&s;e, whil&s;t Mr. William Power &s;tood with his hand &s;u&s;pended.&mdash;"Aye, Hardy, Sir," repeated he. "I told him you'd not be|lieve your own eyes."&mdash;Mr. Trueman ad|vanced with a &s;low &s;tep. "Now, Sir, give me leave," &s;aid the U&s;her, eagerly drawing him a&s;ide and whi&s;pering.&mdash;"So, Sir," &s;aid Mr. T. when the whi&s;per was done, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Hardy with a voice and manner, which, had he been guilty, mu&s;t have pierced him to the heart, "I find I have been deceived in you&mdash; it is but three hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my &s;chool in whom I

"I am not a thief! I have never had any thing to do with thieves," cried Hardy, indignantly. "Have not you robbed this old man? don't you know the ta&s;te of the&s;e apples?" &s;aid Mr. Trueman, taking one out of the ba&s;ket. "No, Sir, I do not; I never touched one of that old man's apples."&mdash;"Never touched one of them! I &s;up|po&s;e this is &s;ome vile equivocation; you have done wor&s;e, you have had the barbarity, the ba&s;ene&s;s, to attempt to poi&s;on his dog; the poi|&s;oned meat was found in your pocket la&s;t night."

"Non&s;en&s;e! cunning!" &s;aid Mr. Power. "I hope you won't let him impo&s;e upon you &s;o, Sir." "No, he cannot impo&s;e upon me, I have a proof he is little prepared for," &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Mr. Trueman, producing the blue hand|kerchief in which the meat had been wrapped.</P>
<P>Tariton turned pale; Hardy's countenance never changed.&mdash;"Don't you know this hand|kerchief, Sir?"&mdash;"I do, Sir?"&mdash;"Is it not your,"&mdash;"No, Sir."&mdash;"Don't you know who&s;e it is?" cried Mr. Power. Hardy was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Now, gentlemen," &s;aid Mr. Trueman, "I am not fond of puni&s;hing you; but when I do it y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u know it is always in earne&s;t.

"I'm &s;ure it's not mine;" and "I'm &s;ure it's none of mine," bur&s;t from every mouth, whil&s;t they looked at each other in di&s;may, for none but Hardy, Loveit, and Tarlton knew the &s;ecret.&mdash; "My cane!" &s;aid Mr. Trueman, and Power handed him the cane&mdash;Loveit groaned from the

<P>"But fir&s;t," &s;aid Mr. Trueman, laying down the cane, "let us &s;ee; perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way," examining the corners; it was torn almo&s;t to pieces, but luckily the corner that was marked remained.</P>
<P>"J. T.!" cried Mr. Trueman. Every eye turned upon the guilty Tarlton, who, now, as pale as a&s;hes and trembling in every limb, &s;unk down upon his knees, and in a whining voice begged for mercy. "Upon my word and ho|nour, Sir, I'll tell you all; I &s;hould never have thought of &s;tealing the apples if Loveit had not fir&s;t told me of them; and it was Tom who fir&s;t put the poi&s;oning the dog into my head: it was he that carried the meat; <HI>wasn't it?</HI>" &s;aid he, appealing to Hardy, who&s;e word he knew mu&s;t be believed&mdash;"Oh, dear Sir!" continued he, as Mr. Trueman began to move towards him, "do let me off&mdash;do pray let me off this time!

<P>At the&s;e words Loveit fir&s;t, and immediately all the re&s;t of the guilty party, &s;tepped out of the ranks, confe&s;&s;ed their fault, and declared them&s;elves ready to bear any puni&s;hment their ma&s;ter thought proper.&mdash;"Oh, they have been puni&s;hed enough," &s;aid the old man; "forgive them, Sir."</P>
<P>Hardy looked as if he wi&s;hed to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Not becau&s;e you a&s;k it," &s;aid Mr. True|man, "though I &s;hould be glad to oblige you &mdash;it wouldn't be ju&s;t&mdash;but there (pointing to Hardy), there is one who has merited a reward;

<P>Hardy bowed, and his face glowed with plea|&s;ure, whil&s;t every body pre&s;ent &s;umpathi&s;ed in his feelings.&mdash;"I am &s;ure," thought Loveit, "this is a le&s;&s;on I &s;hall never forget."</P>

<HEAD>LAZY LAWRENCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the plea&s;ant valley of A&s;hton there lived an elderly woman of the name of Pre&s;ton; &s;he had a &s;mall neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be &s;een in her garden. It was upon her garden that &s;he chiefly depended for &s;up|port: it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;trawberry beds, and one &s;mall border for flowers. The pinks and ro&s;es &s;he tied up in nice no&s;egays, and &s;ent either to Clifton or Bri&s;tol to be &s;old; as to her &s;traw|berries, &s;he did not &s;end them to market, be|cau&s;e it was the cu&s;tom for numbers of people to come from Clifton, in the &s;ummer time, to eat &s;trawberries and cream at the gardens in A&s;hton.</P>
<P>Now the widow Pre&s;ton was &s;o obliging, ac|tive, and good humoured, that every one who came to &s;ee her was plea&s;ed. She lived happily in this manner for &s;everal years; but, alas! one autumn &s;he fell &s;ick, and, during her illne&s;s, every thing went wrong; her garden was ne|glected, her cow died, and all the money which &s;he had &s;aved was &s;pent in paying for medicines.
<PB REF="69">The winter pa&s;&s;ed away, while &s;he was &s;o weak that &s;he could earn but little by her work; and, when the &s;ummer came, her rent was called for, and the rent was not ready in her little pur&s;e as u&s;ual. She begged a few months delay, and they were granted to her; but at the end of that time there was no re&s;ource but to &s;ell her hor&s;e Lightfoot. Now Lightfoot, though perhaps he had &s;een his be&s;t days, was a very great favourite: in his youth he had al|ways carried the dame to market behind her hu&s;band; and it was now her little &s;on Jem's turn to ride him. It was Jem's bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;eed Lightfoot, and to take care of him; a charge which he never neglected, for, be&s;ides being a very good-natured, he was a very in|du&s;trious boy.</P>
<P>"It will go near to break my Jem's heart," &s;aid dame Pre&s;ton to her&s;elf, as &s;he &s;at one even|ing be&s;ide the fire &s;tirring the embers, and con|&s;idering how &s;he had be&s;t open the matter to her &s;on, who &s;tood oppo&s;ite to her, eating a dry cru&s;t of bread very heartily for &s;upper.</P>
<P>"Jem," &s;aid the old woman, "what, ar't hungry?"</P>
<P>"That I am, brave and hungry!"</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="70">
"Aye! no wonder, you've been brave hard at work &mdash; Eh?"</P>
<P>"Brave hard! I wi&s;h it was not &s;o dark, mo|ther, that you might ju&s;t &s;tep out and &s;ee the great bed I've dug; I know you'd &s;ay it was no bad day's work &mdash;and, oh mother! I've good news; Farmer Truck will give us the giant-&s;trawberries, and I'm to go for 'em to-morrow morning, and I'll be back afore breakfa&s;t."</P>
<P>"God ble&s;s the boy! how he talks! &mdash; Four mile there, and four mile back again, afore breakfa&s;t."</P>
<P>"Aye, upon Lightfoot you know, mother, very ea&s;ily; mayn't I?"</P>
<P>"Aye, child!"</P>
<P>"Why do you &s;igh, mother?"</P>
<P>"Fini&s;h thy &s;upper, child."</P>
<P>"I've done!" cried Jem, &s;wallowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e la&s;t mouthful ha&s;tily, as if he thought he had been too long at &s;upper &mdash; "and now for the great needle; I mu&s;t &s;ee and mend Lightfoot's bridle afore I go to bed." &mdash; To work he &s;et, by the light of the fire, and the dame having once more &s;tirred it, began again with "Jem, dear, does he go lame at all now" &mdash; "What Light|foot! Oh la, no, not he! &mdash; never was &s;o well
<PB N="57" REF="71">of his lamene&s;s in all his life&mdash;he's grown quite young again, I think, and then he's &s;o fat he can hardly wag." &mdash; "God ble&s;s him &mdash; that's right &mdash; we mu&s;t &s;ee, Jem, and keep him fat."</P>
<P>"For what, mother?"</P>
<P>"For Monday fortnight at the fair. He's to be&mdash;&s;old!"</P>
<P>"Lightfoot!" cried Jem, and let the bridle fall from his hand; "and <HI>will</HI> mother &s;ell Lightfoot?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Will;</HI> no: but I <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> Jem."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t; who &s;ays you <HI>mu&s;t?</HI> why <HI>mu&s;t</HI> you, mother?"</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t, I &s;ay, child &mdash; Why, mu&s;t not I pay my debts hone&s;tly &mdash; and mu&s;t not I pay my rent; and was not it called for long and long ago; and have not I had time; and did not I promi&s;e to pay it for certain Monday fortnight, and am not I two guineas &s;hort &mdash; and where am I to get two guineas?

<P>Jem was &s;ilent for a &s;ew minutes.&mdash;"Two guineas; that's a great, great deal. &mdash; If I work|ed, and worked, and worked ever &s;o hard, I could no ways earn two guineas <HI>afore</HI> Mon|day fortnight&mdash;could I, mother?"</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="72">
"Lord help thee, no; not an' work thy&s;elf to dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h."</P>
<P>"But I could earn &s;omething, though, I &s;ay," cried Jem proudly; "and I <HI>will</HI> earn <HI>&s;omething</HI> &mdash; if it be ever &s;o little, it will be <HI>&s;ome|thing</HI> &mdash; and I &s;hall do my very be&s;t; &s;o I will."</P>
<P>"That I'm &s;ure of, my child," &s;aid his mo|ther, drawing him towards her and ki&s;&s;ing him; "you were always a good indu&s;trious lad, <HI>that</HI> I will &s;ay afore your face or behind your back; &mdash;but it won't do now&mdash; Lightfoot <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go."</P>
<P>Jem turned away, &s;truggling to hide his tears, and went to bed without &s;aying a word more. But he knew that crying would do no good, &s;o he pre&s;ently wiped his eyes, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y awake, con&s;idering what he could po&s;&s;ibly do to &s;ave the hor&s;e.&mdash;"If I get ever &s;o little," he &s;till &s;aid to him&s;elf, "it will be <HI>&s;omething;</HI> and who knows but Landlord might then wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time."</P>
<P>But how to get the fir&s;t penny was the que&s;|tion &mdash; The he recollected, that one day, when he had been &s;ent to Clifton to &s;ell &s;ome flowers, he had &s;een an old woman with a board be&s;ide
<PB N="59" REF="73">her covered with various &s;parkling &s;tones, which people &s;topped to look at as they pa&s;&s;ed, and he remembered that &s;ome people b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ught the &s;tones; one paid twopence, another threepence, and another &s;ixpence for them; and Jem heard her &s;ay that &s;he got them amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t the neigh|bouring rocks: &s;o he thought that if he tried he might find &s;ome too, and &s;ell them as &s;he had done.</P>
<P>Early in the morning he wakened full of this &s;cheme, jumped up, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his &s;tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t off to Clifton in &s;earch of the old woman, to enquire where &s;he found her &s;parkling &s;tones. But it was too early in the morning, the old woman was not at her &s;eat; &s;o he turned back again di&s;appointed&punc; &mdash; He did not wa&s;te his time waiting for her, but &s;addled and bridled Light|foot, and went to farmer Truck's for the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t|&s;trawberries. A great part of the morning was &s;pent in putting them into the ground; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as &s;oon as that was fini&s;hed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e let out again in que&s;t of the old woman, who, to his great joy, he &s;pied &s;itting at her corner of the &s;treet with her board before her. But this old woman was deaf and cro&s;s; and when at la&s;t Jem made her
<PB N="60" REF="74">hear his que&s;tions, he could get no an&s;wer from her, but that &s;he found the fo&s;&s;ils where he would never find any more. "But can't I look where you looked?" &mdash; "Look away, no|body hinders you," replied the old woman; and the&s;e were the only words &s;he would &s;ay. &mdash; Jem was not, however, a boy to be ea&s;ily di&s;cou|raged; he went to the rocks, and walked &s;lowly along, looking at all the &s;tones as he pa&s;&s;ed. Pre&s;ently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loo&s;ening &s;ome large rocks, and one among&s;t the workmen was &s;tooping down looking for &s;omething very eagerly; Jem ran up, and a&s;ked if he could help him. "Yes," &s;aid the man, "you can; I've ju&s;t dropped, among&s;t this heap of rubbi&s;h, a fine piece of cry&s;tal that I got to-day." &mdash; "What kind of a looking thing is it?" &s;aid Jem. "White, and like gla&s;," &s;aid the man, and went on working whil&s;t Jem looked very care|fully over the heap of rubbi&s;h for a great while. "Come," &s;aid the man, "it's gone for ever; don't trouble your&s;elf any more, my boy." &mdash;" It's no trouble; I'll look a little longer; we'll not give it up &s;o &s;oon," &s;aid Jem; and, after he had looked a little longer, he found the piece of
<PB N="61" REF="75">cry&s;tal. "Thank'e," &s;aid the man, "you are a fine little indu&s;trious fellow." Jem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man &s;poke this, ventured to a&s;k him the &s;ame que&s;tions which he had a&s;ked the old woman. "One good turn de&s;erves another," &s;aid the man; "we are going to dinner ju&s;t now, and &s;hall leave off work&mdash;wait for me here, and I'll make it worth your while."</P>
<P>Jem waited; and, as he was very attentively ob&s;erving how the workmen went on with their work, he heard &s;omebody near him give a great yawn, and, turning round, he &s;aw &s;tretched upon the gra&s;s, be&s;ide the river, a boy about his own age, who he knew very well went in the village of A&s;hton by the name of Lazy Lawrence: a name which he mo&s;t ju&s;tly de|&s;erved, for he never did any thing from morn|ing to night; he neither worked nor played, but &s;auntered or lounged about re&s;tle&s;s and yawning. His father was an alehou&s;e-keeper, and being generally drunk, could take no care of his &s;on, &s;o that Lazy Lawrence grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e. However, &s;ome of the neighbours &s;aid that he was a good-natured poor fellow enough, and would never do any one

<P>"What, Lawrence!" cried Jem to him, when he &s;aw him lying upon the gra&s;s&mdash; "what, are you a&s;leep?" &mdash; "Not quite." &mdash; "Are you a wake?" &mdash; "Not quite." &mdash; "What are you doing there?" &mdash; "Nothing." &mdash; "What are you thinking of?" &mdash; "Nothing." &mdash; "What makes you lie there?" &mdash; "I don't know&mdash;be|cau&s;e I can't find any body to play with me to|day &mdash; Will you come and play?" &mdash; "No, I can't; I'm bu&s;y."&mdash;"Bu&s;y," cried Lawrence, &s;tretching him&s;elf, "you are always bu&s;y &mdash; I would not be you for the world, to have &s;o much to do always." &mdash; "And I," &s;aid Jem laughing, "would not be you for the world, to have nothing to do." So they parted, for the workman ju&s;t then called Jem to follow him. He took him home to his own hou&s;e, and &s;howed him a par|cel of fo&s;&s;ils, which he had gathered, he &s;aid, on purpo&s;e to &s;ell, but had never had time yet to &s;ort them. He &s;et about it however now, and having picked out tho&s;e which he judged to be the be&s;t, he put them in a &s;mall ba&s;ket, and gave them to Jem to &s;ell, upon condition that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould bring him half of what he got. Jem,
<PB N="63" REF="77">plea&s;ed to be employed, was ready to agree to what the man propo&s;ed, provided his mother had no objection to it. When he went home to dinner, he told his mother his &s;cheme, and &s;he &s;miled and &s;aid he might do as he plea&s;ed, for &s;he was not afraid of his being from home. "You are not an idle boy," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;o there is little danger of your getting into any mi&s;|chief."</P>
<P>Accordingly Jem that evening took his &s;tand, with his little ba&s;ket, upon the bank of the river, ju&s;t at the place where people land from a ferry-boat, and where the walk turns to the wells, where numbers of people perpetually pa&s;s to drink the waters. He cho&s;e his place well, and waited almo&s;t all evening, offering his fo&s;|&s;ils with great a&s;&s;iduity to every pa&s;&s;enger; but not one per&s;on bought any. "Holla!" cried &s;ome &s;ailors, who had ju&s;t rowed a boat to land, "bear a hand here, will you, my little fellow! and carry the&s;e parcels for us into yonder hou&s;e." Jem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was a&s;ked to do &s;o quickly, and with &s;o much good will, that the ma&s;ter of the boat took notice of him, and, when he was go|ing away, &s;topped to a&s;k him what he had got in his little ba&s;ket; and when he &s;aw that they
<PB N="64" REF="78">were fo&s;&s;ils, he immediately told Jem to follow him, for that he was going to carry &s;ome &s;hells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was making a grotto. "She will very likely buy your &s;tones into the bar|gain: come along, my lad; we can but try."</P>
<P>The lady lived but a very little way off, &s;o that they were &s;oon at her hou&s;e. She was alone in her parlour, and was &s;orting a bundle of feathers of different colours: they lay on a &s;heet of pa&s;teboard upon a window-&s;eat, and it hap|pened that as the &s;ailor was bu&s;tling round the table to &s;hew off his &s;hells, he knocked down the &s;heet of pa&s;teboard, and &s;cattered all the fea|thers. The lady looked very &s;orry, which Jem ob&s;erving, he took the opportunity, whil&s;t &s;he was bu&s;y looking over the &s;ailor's bag of &s;hells, to gather together all the feathers, and &s;ort them according to their different colours, as he had &s;een them &s;orted when he fir&s;t came into the room.</P>
<P>"Where is the little boy you brought with you? I thought I &s;aw him here ju&s;t now."&mdash; "And here I am, ma'am," cried Jem, creeping from under the table with &s;ome few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet;
<PB N="65" REF="79">"I thought," added he, pointing to the others, "I had better be doing &s;omething than &s;tand|ing idle, ma'am." She &s;miled, and, plea&s;ed with his activity and &s;implicity, began to a&s;k him &s;everal que&s;tions; &s;uch as, who he was, where he lived, what employment he had, and how much a day he earned by gathering fo&s;&s;ils. "This is the fir&s;t day I ever tried," &s;aid Jem; "I never &s;old any yet, and, if you don't buy 'em now, ma'am, I'm afraid nobody el&s;e will, for I've a&s;ked every body el&s;e." &mdash; "Come then," &s;aid the lady laughing, "if that is the ca&s;e, I think I had better buy them all." So emptying all the fo&s;&s;ils out of his ba&s;ket, &s;he put half a crown into it. Jem's eyes &s;parkled with joy. "Oh, thank you, ma'am," &s;aid he, "I will be &s;ure and bring you as many more to|morrow." &mdash; "Yes, but I don't promi&s;e you," &s;aid &s;he, "to give you half a crown to-mor|row." &mdash; "But, perhaps, though you don't pro|mi&s;e it, you will."&mdash;"No," &s;aid the lady, "do not deceive your&s;elf; I a&s;&s;ure you that I will not. <HI>That,</HI> in&s;tead of encouraging you to be indu&s;trious, would teach you to be idle." Jem did not quite under&s;tand what &s;he meant by this, but an&s;wered, "I'm &s;ure I don't wi&s;h to
<PB N="66" REF="80">be idle; what I want is to earn &s;omething every day, if I knew how: I'm &s;ure I don't wi&s;h to be idle. If you knew all, you'd know I did not." &mdash; "How do you mean, <HI>if I knew all?"</HI> &mdash; "Why I mean, if you knew about Light|foot." &mdash; "Who's Lightfoot?" &mdash; "Why, mam|my's hor&s;e," added Jem, looking out of the window; "I mu&s;t make ha&s;te home and feed him, afore it get dark; he'll wonder what's gone with me." &mdash; "Let him wonder a few mi|nutes longer," &s;aid the lady, "and tell me the re&s;t of your &s;tory." &mdash; "I've no &s;tory, ma'am, to tell, but as how mammy &s;ays he mu&s;t go to the fair Monday fortnight to be &s;old, if &s;he can't get the two guineas for her rent; and I &s;hould be main &s;orry to part with him, for I love him, and he loves me; &s;o I'll work for him, I will, all I can: to be &s;ure," as mammy &s;ays, "I have no chance, &s;uch a little fellow as I am, of earning two guineas afore Monday fortnight." &mdash; "But are you in earne&s;t willing to work," &s;aid the lady; "you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few &s;tones, and working &s;teadily every day, and all day long." &mdash; "But," &s;aid Jem, "I would work every day, and all day long." &mdash; "Then," &s;aid
<PB N="67" REF="81">the lady, "I will give you work. Come here to-morrow morning, and my gardener will &s;et you to weed the &s;hrubberies, and I will pay you &s;ix-pence a day. Remember you mu&s;t be at the gates by &s;ix o'clock." Jem bowed, thank|ed her, and went away. It was late in the evening, and he was impatient to get home to feed Lightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promi&s;ed the man who had tru&s;ted him to &s;ell the fo&s;&s;ils that he would bring him half of what he got for them; &s;o he thought that he had bet|ter go to him directly: and away he went, run|ning along by the water &s;ide about a quarter of a mile, till he came to the man's hou&s;e. He was ju&s;t come home from work, and was &s;ur|pri&s;ed when Jem &s;hewed him the half-crown, &s;aying, "Look what I got for the &s;tones: you are to have half, you know." &mdash; No," &s;aid the man, when he had heard his &s;tory, "I &s;hall not take half of that; it was given to you. I ex|pected but a &s;hilling at the mo&s;t, and the half of that is but &s;ixpence, and that I'll take. &mdash; Wife! give the lad two &s;hillings, and take this half-crown." So wife opened an old glove, and took out two &s;hillings; and the man, as &s;he opened the glove, put in his fingers, and took
<PB N="68" REF="82">out a little &s;ilver penny. &mdash; "There, he &s;hall have that into the bargain for his hone&s;ty &mdash; Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy&mdash;There's a lucky penny for you, that I've kept ever &s;ince I can remember." &mdash; "Don't you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!" cried the woman. "Let him do what he will with it, wife," &s;aid the man. "But," argued the wife, "another penny would do ju&s;t as well to buy ginger bread, and that's what it will go for." &mdash; "No, that it &s;hall not, I promi&s;e you;" &s;aid Jem; and &s;o he ran away home, fed Lightfoot, &s;troaked him, went to bed, jumped up at five o'clock in the morning, and went &s;inging to work as gay as a lark.</P>
<P>Four days he worked "every day and all day long," and the lady every evening, when &s;he came out to walk in her gardens, looked at his work. At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid to her gardener, "This little boy works very hard." &mdash; "Never had &s;o good a little boy about the grounds," &s;aid the gardener; "he's always at his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got twice as much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma'am; for look here&mdash;he began at this here ro&s;e bu&s;h, and now he's got to where you &s;tand,
<PB N="69" REF="83">ma'am; and here is the day's work that t'other boy, and he's three years older too, did to-day &mdash;I &s;ay, mea&s;ure Jem's fairly, and it's twice as much, I'm &s;ure." &mdash; "Well, &s;aid the lady to her gardener, &s;hew me how much is a fair good day's work for a boy of his age."&mdash;"Come at &s;ix o'clock, and go at &s;ix? why, about this much, ma'am," &s;aid the gardener, marking off a piece of the border with his &s;pade. "Then, little boy," &s;aid the lady, "&s;o much &s;hall be your ta&s;k every day; the gardener will mark it off for you: and when you've done, the re&s;t of the day you may do what you plea&s;e." Jem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had fini&s;hed his ta&s;k by four o'clock; &s;o that he had all the re&s;t of the evening to him&s;elf. Jem was as fond of play as any little boy could be, and, when he was at it, played with all the eagerne&s;s and gaiety imaginable: &s;o as &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed his ta&s;k, fed Lightfoot, and put by the &s;ixpence he had earned that day, he ran to the play-ground in the village, where he found a party of boys playing, and among&s;t them Lazy Lawrence, who indeed was not playing, but lounging upon a gate with his thumb in his mouth. The re&s;t were playing at
<PB N="70" REF="84">cricket. Jem joined them, and was the mer|rie&s;t and mo&s;t active among&s;t them; till, at la&s;t, when quite out of breath with running, he was obliged to give up to re&s;t him&s;elf, and &s;at down upon the &s;tile, clo&s;e to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was &s;winging. "And why don't you play, Lawrence?" &s;aid he.&mdash;"I'm tired," &s;aid Lawrence. &mdash; "Tired of what?" &mdash; "I don't know well what tires me; grandmother &s;ays I'm ill, and I mu&s;t take &s;omething&mdash;I don't know what ails me." &mdash; "Oh, pugh! take a good race, one, two, three, and away, and you'll find your&s;elf as well as ever. Come, run &mdash; one, two, three, and away." &mdash; "Ah, no, I can't run indeed," &s;aid he, hanging back hea|vily; "you know I can play all day long if I like it, &s;o I don't mind play as you do, who have only one hour for it." &mdash; "So much the wor&s;e for you. Come now, I'm quite fre&s;h again, will you have one game at ball; do." &mdash; "No, I tell you I can't; I'm as tired as if I had been working all day long as hard as a hor&s;e." &mdash; "Ten times more," &s;aid Jem, "for I have been working all day long as hard as a hor&s;e, and yet you &s;ee I'm not a bit tired; only a little out of breath ju&s;t now." &mdash; "That's very
<PB N="71" REF="85">odd," &s;aid Lawrence, and yawned, for want of &s;ome better an&s;wer; then taking out a handful of halfpence&mdash;"See what I got from father to|day, becau&s;e I a&s;ked him ju&s;t at the right time, when he had drank a gla&s;s or two; then I can get any thing I want out of him&mdash;&s;ee! a penny, two-pence, three-pence, four-pence &mdash; there's eight-pence in all; would not you be happy if you had <HI>eight-pence?</HI>" &mdash; "Why, I don't know," &s;aid Jem laughing, "for you don't &s;eem happy, and you <HI>have eight-pence.</HI>" &mdash; "That does not &s;ignify though&mdash;I'm &s;ure you only &s;ay that be|cau&s;e you envy me&mdash;you don't know what it is to have eight-pence&mdash;you never had more than two-pence or three-pence at a time in all your life." Jem &s;miled. "Oh, as to that," &s;aid he, "you are mi&s;taken, for I have at this very time more than two-pence, three-pence, or eight-pence either; I have&mdash;let me &s;ee&mdash;&s;tones, two &s;hillings; then five day's work, that's five &s;ix-pences, that's two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, in all makes four &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence, and my &s;il|ver penny, is four and &s;even-pence &mdash; Four and &s;even-pence!" &mdash; "You have not!" &s;aid Law|rence, rou&s;ed &s;o as ab&s;olutely to &s;tand upright, "four and &s;even-pence! have you? Shew it
<PB N="72" REF="86">me, and then I'll believe you. &mdash; "Follow me then," cried Jem, "and I'll &s;oon make you believe me; come." &mdash; "Is it far?" &s;aid Law|rence, following half running, half hobbling, till he came to the &s;table, where Jem &s;hewed him his trea&s;ure. "And how did you come by it? hone&s;tly?" &mdash; "Hone&s;tly; to be &s;ure I did; I earned it all." &mdash; "Lord ble&s;s me, earned it! well, I've a great mind to work; but then it's &s;uch hot weather; be&s;ides grandmother &s;ays I'm not &s;trong enough yet for hard work; and be&s;ides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want it, &s;o I need not work. &mdash; But four and &s;even-pence; let's &s;ee, what will you do with it all? &mdash; "That's a &s;ecret," &s;aid Jem, looking great. "I can gue&s;s; I know what I'd do with it if it was mine &mdash; Fir&s;t, I'd buy pockets full of gingerbread; then I'd buy ever &s;o many apples and nuts; don't you love nuts? I'd buy nuts enough to la&s;t me from this time to Chri&s;tmas, and I'd make little Newton crack 'em for me, for that's the wor&s;t of nuts, there's the trouble of cracking 'em." &mdash; "Well, you never de&s;erve to have a nut." &mdash; "But you'll give me &s;ome of yours," &s;aid Lawrence in a fawning tone, for he thought it
<PB N="73" REF="87">ea&s;ier to coax than to work &mdash; "you'll give me &s;ome of your good things, won't you?" &mdash; "I &s;hall not have any of tho&s;e good things," &s;aid Jem. "Then what will you do with all your money?" &mdash; "Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told you, that's a &s;ecret, and I &s;han't tell it any body &mdash; Come now, let's go back and play &mdash; their game's up, I dare &s;ay." &mdash; Lawrence went back with him full of curio|&s;ity, and out of humour with him&s;elf and his eight-pence. &mdash; "If I had four and &s;even-pence," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I certainly &s;hould be happy!"</P>
<P>The next day, as u&s;ual, Jem jumped up before &s;ix o'clock and went to his work, whil&s;t Lazy Lawrence &s;auntered about without knowing what to do with him&s;elf. In the cour&s;e of two days he laid out &s;ix-pence of his money in ap|ples and gingerbread, and as long as the&s;e la&s;ted he &s;ound him&s;elf well received by his compa|nions; but at length the third day he &s;pent his la&s;t halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfor|tunately &s;ome nuts tempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; &s;o he ran home to coax his father, as he called it. When he got home, he heard his father talk|ing
<PB N="74" REF="88">very loud, and at fir&s;t he thought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen door, he &s;aw that he was not drunk, but angry.</P>
<P>"You lazy dog!" cried he, turning &s;udden|ly upon Lawrence, and gave him &s;uch a violent box on the ear as made the light fla&s;h from his eyes; "you lazy dog! &s;ee what you've done for me &mdash; look! &mdash; look, look, I &s;ay!" Lawrence looked as &s;oon as he came to the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, and, with fear, amazement, and remor&s;e, beheld at lea&s;t a dozen bottles bur&s;t, and the fine Worce&s;ter&s;hire cyder &s;treaming over the floor. "Now, did not I-order you three days ago to carry the&s;e bottles to the cellar; and did not I charge you to wire the corks? an&s;wer me, you lazy ra&s;cal; did not I?" &mdash; "Yes," &s;aid Lawrence, &s;cratching his head. "And why was not it done? I a&s;k you," cried his fa|ther with renewed anger, as another bottle bur&s;t at the moment. "What do you &s;tand there for, you lazy brat? why don't you move? I &s;ay&mdash;No, no," catching hold of him, "I be|lieve you can't move; but I'll make you." And he &s;hook him, till Lawrence was &s;o giddy he could not &s;tand. "What had you to think of? what had you to do all day long, that you
<PB N="75" REF="89">could not carry my cyder, my Worce&s;ter&s;hire cyder, to the cellar when I bid you? But go, you'll never be good for any thing, you are &s;uch a lazy ra&s;cal &mdash; get out of my &s;ight!" So &s;aying, he pu&s;hed him out of the hou&s;e door, and Lawrence &s;neaked off, &s;eeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence.</P>
<P>The next day he &s;aw the nuts again, and, wi&s;hing for them more than ever, went home in hopes that his father, as he &s;aid to him&s;elf, would be in a better humour. But the cyder was &s;till fre&s;h in his recollection, and the mo|ment Lawrence began to whi&s;per the word "halfpenny" in his ear, his father &s;wore, with a loud oath, "I will not give you a halfpenny, no, not a farthing, for a month to come; if you want money, go work for it; I've had enough of your lazine&s;s &mdash; Go work!" At the&s;e terrible words Lawrence bur&s;t into tears, and, going to the &s;ide of a ditch, &s;at down and cried for an hour; and when he had cried till he could cry no more, he exerted him&s;elf &s;o far as to empty his pockets, to &s;ee whether there might not hap|pen to be one halfpenny left; and, to his great joy, in the farthe&s;t corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found. With this he proceeded
<PB N="76" REF="90">to the fruit woman's &s;tall. She was bu&s;y weigh|ing out &s;ome plums, &s;o he was obliged to wait; and, whil&s;t he was waiting, he heard &s;ome peo|ple near him talking and laughing very loud. The fruit woman's &s;tall was at the gate of an inn-yard; and peeping through the gate in this yard, Lawrence &s;aw a po&s;tilion and a &s;table-boy about his own &s;ize playing at pitch-far|thing. He &s;tood by watching them for a few minutes. "I begun but with one halfpenny," cried the &s;table-boy with an oath, "and now I've got two-pence!" added he, jingling the half-pence in his wai&s;tcoat pocket Lawrence was moved at the &s;ound, and &s;aid to him&s;elf, "If <HI>I</HI> begin with one halfpenny, I may end like him with having two-pence; and it is ea&s;ier to play at pitch-farthing than to work."</P>
<P>So he &s;tepped forward, pre&s;enting his half|penny, offering to to&s;s up with the &s;table-boy, who, after looking him full in the face, ac|cepted the propo&s;al, and threw his halfpenny into the air. "Head or tail!" cried he. "Head," replied Lawrence, and it came up head. He &s;eized the penny, &s;urpri&s;ed at his own &s;ucce&s;s, and would have gone in&s;tantly to have laid it out in nuts; but the &s;table-boy
<PB N="77" REF="91">&s;topped him, and tempted him to throw again. This time he lo&s;t; he threw again and won; and &s;o he went on, &s;ometimes lo&s;ing, but mo&s;t frequently winning, till half the morning was gone. At la&s;t, however, he chanced to win twice running, and, finding him&s;elf ma&s;ter of three halfpence, &s;aid he would play no more. The &s;table-boy, grumbling, &s;wore he would have his revenge another time, and Lawrence went and bought the nuts. "It is a good thing," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "to play at pitch-farthing: the next time I want a halfpenny I'll not a&s;k my father for it, nor go to work neither." Satisfied with this re&s;olution, he &s;at down to crack his nuts at his lei&s;ure, upon the hor&s;e-block in the inn-yard. Here, whil&s;t he eat, he overheard the conver&s;ation of the &s;table-boys and po&s;tilions. At fir&s;t their &s;hocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and &s;hock|ed him; for Lawrence, though a <HI>lazy,</HI> had not yet learned to be a <HI>wicked</HI> boy. But, by de|grees, he was accu&s;tomed to their &s;wearing and quarrelling, and took a delight and intere&s;t in their di&s;putes and battles. As this was an amu&s;ement which he could enjoy without any &s;ort of exertion on his part, he &s;oon grew &s;o
<PB N="78" REF="92">fond of it, that every day he returned to the &s;table-yard, and the hor&s;e-block became his con&s;tant &s;eat. Here he &s;ound &s;ome relief from the in&s;upportable fatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after hour, with his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hands, he &s;at the &s;pectator of wickedne&s;s. Gaming, cheating, and lying, &s;oon became familiar to him; and, to complete his ruin, he formed a &s;udden and clo&s;e intimacy with the &s;table-boy with whom he had fir&s;t began to game&mdash;a very bad boy. The con&s;equences of this intimacy we &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee. But it is now time to inquire what little Jem has been doing all this while.</P>
<P>One day, after he had fini&s;hed his ta&s;k, the gardener a&s;ked him to &s;tay a little while, to help him to carry &s;ome geranium pots into the hall. Jem. always active and obliging, readily &s;tayed from play, and was carrying in a heavy flower-pot, when his mi&s;tre&s;s cro&s;&s;ed the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll. "What a terrible litter!" &s;aid the, "you are making here&mdash;why don't you wipe your &s;hoes upon the mat?" Jem turned round to look for the mat, but he &s;aw none. "Oh," &s;aid the lady, recollecting her&s;elf, "I can't blame you, for there is no mat."&mdash;"No, ma'am" &s;aid the
<PB N="79" REF="93">gardener, "nor I don't know when, if ever, the man will bring home tho&s;e mats you be&s;poke, ma'am."&mdash;"I am very &s;orry to hear that," &s;aid the lady, "I wi&s;h we could find &s;omebody who would do them, if he can't&mdash;I &s;hould not care what &s;ort of mats they were, &s;o that one could wipe one's feet on them." Jem, as he was &s;weeping away the litter, when he heard the&s;e la&s;t words, &s;aid to him&s;elf, "perhaps I could make a mat?" And all the way home, as he trudged along whi&s;tling, he was thinking over a &s;cheme for making mats, which, however bold it may appear, he did not de&s;pair of exe|cuting, with patience and indu&s;try. Many were the difficulties which his <HI>"prophetic eye"</HI> fore&s;aw; but he felt within him&s;elf that &s;pirit, which &s;purs men on to great enterprizes, and makes them "trample on impo&s;&s;ibilities."</P>
<P>He recollected, in the fir&s;t place, that he had &s;een Lacy Lawrence, whil&s;t he lounged upon the gate, twi&s;t a bit of heath into diffe|rent &s;hapes, and he thought, that if he could find &s;ome way of plaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green &s;oft mat, which would do very well for one to wipe one's &s;hoes on. About a mile from his mother's
<PB N="80" REF="94">hou&s;e, on the common which Jem rode over when he went to farmer Truck's for the giant-&s;trawberries, he remembered to have &s;een a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only &s;ix o'clock in the evening, he knew that he &s;hould have time to feed Lightfoot, &s;troak him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his &s;kill before he went to bed.</P>
<P>Lightfoot carried him &s;wiftly to the common, and there Jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he &s;hould want. But, what toil! what time! what pains did it co&s;t him, before he could make any thing like a mat! Twenty times he was ready to throw a&s;ide the heath, and give up his project, from impatience of re|peated di&s;appointments. But &s;till he per&s;evered. Nothing <HI>truly great</HI> can be accompli&s;hed with|out toil and time. Two hours he worked be|fore he went to bed. All his play hours the next day he &s;pent at his mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitle&s;s attempts&mdash;The &s;ixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other five; he conquered his grand diffi|culty of fa&s;tening the heath &s;ub&s;tantially toge|ther, and at length completely fini&s;hed a mat,
<PB N="81" REF="95">which far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions. He was extremely happy&mdash;&s;ung, danced round it&mdash;whi&s;tled&mdash;looked at it again and again, and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed. He laid it by his bed-&s;ide, that he might &s;ee it the moment he wakened in the morning.</P>
<P>And now came the grand plea&s;ure of carry|ing it to his mi&s;tre&s;s. She looked full as much &s;urprized as he expected, when &s;he &s;aw it, and when &s;he heard who made it. After having duly admired it, &s;he a&s;ked him how much he expected for his mat. "Expect!&mdash;Nothing, ma'am," &s;aid Jem; "I meant to give it you, if you'd have it; I did not mean to &s;ell it. I made it at my play hours, and I was very happy making it; and I'm very glad too that you like it; and if you plea&s;e to keep it, ma'am&mdash;that's all."&mdash;"But that's not all," &s;aid the lady. "Spend your time no more in weeding in my garden, you can employ your&s;elf much better; you &s;hall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your indu&s;try. Make as many more &s;uch mats as you can, and I will take care and di&s;po&s;e of them for you."&mdash;"Thank'e, ma'am," &s;aid Jem, making his be&s;t bow, for he thought
<PB N="82" REF="96">by the lady's looks that &s;he meant to do him a favour, though he repeated to him&s;elf, "di&s;|po&s;e of them," what does that mean?'</P>
<P>The next day he went to work to make more mats, and he &s;oon learned to make them &s;o well and quickly, that he was &s;urprized at his own &s;ucce&s;s. In every one he made he found le&s;s difficulty, &s;o that, in&s;tead of making two, he could &s;oon make &s;our, in a day. In a fortnight he made eighteen. It was Saturday night when he fini&s;hed, and he carried, at three journeys, his eighteen mats to his mi&s;tre&s;s's hou&s;e; piled them all up in the hall, and &s;tood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility, be&s;ide the pile, waiting for his mi&s;tre&s;s's appearance. Pre|&s;ently a folding door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he &s;aw his mi&s;tre&s;s, with a great many gentlemen and ladies, ri&s;ing from &s;everal tables.</P>
<P>"Oh! there is my little boy, and his mats," cried the lady; and, followed by all the re&s;t of the company, &s;he came into the hall. Jem mode&s;tly retired whil&s;t they looked at his mats; but in a minute or two his mi&s;tre&s;s beckoned to him, and, when he came into the middle of the circle, he &s;aw that his pile of mats had di&s;ap|peared. "Well," &s;aid the lady &s;miling, "what
<PB N="83" REF="97">do you &s;ee that makes you look &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed?"&mdash; "That all my mats are gone," &s;aid Jem; "but you are very welcome."&mdash;"Are we?" &s;aid the lady; "well, take up your hat, and go home then, for you &s;ee that it is getting late, and you know, "Lightfoot will wonder what's become of you." Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he had left on the floor.</P>
<P>But how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with &s;hillings. Every one who had taken a mat had put in two &s;hillings; &s;o that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings. "Thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings!" &s;aid the lady; "five and &s;even-pence I think you told me you had earned already&mdash;how much does that make? I mu&s;t add, I believe, one other &s;ix-pence to make out your two guineas."&mdash;"Two guineas!" exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering his ba&s;h|fulne&s;s, for at the moment he forgot where he was, and &s;aw nobody that was by. "Two guineas!" cried he, clapping his hands together &mdash;"Oh Lightfoot!&mdash;oh mother!" Then, re|collecting him&s;elf, he &s;aw his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he now looked up to quite as a friend. "Will <HI>you</HI> thank them all," &s;aid he, &s;carcely daring to glance his eye round upon the company, "will <HI>you</HI> thank 'em, for you know I don't know how
<PB N="84" REF="98">to thank 'em <HI>rightly.</HI>" Every body thought, however, that they had been thanked <HI>rightly.</HI></P>
<P>"Now we won't keep you any longer-on|ly," &s;aid his mi&s;tre&s;s, "I have one thing to a&s;k you, that I may be by when you &s;hew your trea&s;ure to your mother."&mdash;"Come, then," &s;aid Jem, "come with me now."&mdash;"Not now," &s;aid the lady laughing, "but I will come to A&s;hton to-morrow evening; perhaps your mother can find me a few &s;trawherries."</P>
<P>"That &s;he will," &s;aid Jem; "I'll &s;earch the garden my&s;elf." He now went home, but felt it a great re&s;traint to wait till to-morrow even|ing before he told his mother. To con&s;ole him&s;elf he flew to the &s;table: "Lightfoot, you're not to be &s;old to-morrow! poor fel|low!" &s;aid he, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money. Whil&s;t he was intent upon this, Jem was &s;tartled by a noi&s;e at the door: &s;omebody was trying to pull up the latch. It opened, and there came in Lazy Lawrence, with a boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm. They &s;tarted when they got into the middle of the &s;table, and when they &s;aw Jem, who had been at fir&s;t hid|den by the hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="99">
"We&mdash;we&mdash;we came"&mdash;&s;tammered Lazy Lawrence&mdash;"I mean, I came to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;" "To a&s;k you," continued the &s;table-boy in a bold tone, "whether you will go with us to the cock-fight on Monday? See, I've a fine cock here, and Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his, &s;o I came."</P>
<P>Lawrence now attempted to &s;ay &s;omething in prai&s;e of the plea&s;ures of cock-fighting, and in recommendation of his new companion. But Jem looked at the &s;table-boy with di&s;like, and a &s;ort of dread; then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid in a low voice to Lawrence, "Shall you like to &s;tand by and &s;ee its eyes pecked out?"&mdash;"I don't know," &s;aid Lawrence, "as to that; but they &s;ay a cock-fight's a fine fight, and it's no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great many go; and I've nothing el&s;e to do, &s;o I &s;hall go."&mdash;"But I have &s;omething el&s;e to do," &s;aid Jem, laughing, "&s;o I &s;hall not go." &mdash;"But," continued Lawrence, "you know Monday is the great Bri&s;tol fair, and one mu&s;t be merry then, of all days in the year."&mdash;"One day in the year, &s;ure, there's no harm in being merry," &s;aid the &s;table-boy. "I hope not,"
<PB N="86" REF="100">&s;aid Jem; for I know, for my part, I am merry every day in the year."&mdash;"That's very odd," &s;aid Lawrence; "but I know, for my part, I would not for all the world mi&s;s going to the fair, for at lea&s;t it will be &s;omething to talk of for half a year after&mdash;come, you'll go, won't you?"&mdash;"No," &s;aid Jem, &s;till looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill-looking &s;tran|ger. "Then what will you do with all your money?"&mdash;"I'll tell you about that another time," whi&s;pered Jem; "and don't you go to &s;ee that cock's eyes pecked out; it won't make you merry, I'm &s;ure."&mdash;"If I had any thing el&s;e to divert me," &s;aid Lawrence, he&s;itating and yawning.&mdash;"Come," cried the &s;table-boy, &s;eizing his &s;tretching arm, "come along," cried he; and, pulling him away from Jem, upon whom he ca&s;t a look of extreme contempt, "leave him alone, he's not the &s;ort."&mdash; "What a &s;ool you are," &s;aid he to Lawrence, the moment he got him out of the &s;table, "you might have known he would not go&mdash;el&s;e we &s;hould &s;oon have trimmed him out of his four and &s;even-pence. But how came you to talk of four and &s;even-pence; I &s;aw in the manger a hat full of &s;ilver."&mdash;"Indeed!" exclaimed
<PB N="87" REF="101">Lawrence. "Yes, indeed&mdash;but why did you &s;tammer &s;o when we fir&s;t got in? you had like to have blown us all up."&mdash;"I was &s;o a&s;ham|ed," &s;aid Lawrence, hanging down his head. "A&s;hamed! but you mu&s;t not talk of &s;hame now you are in for it, and I &s;han't let you off: you owe us half a crown, recollect, and I mu&s;t be paid to-night; &s;o &s;ee and get the money &s;ome how or other." After a con&s;iderable pau&s;e he added, "I'll an&s;wer for it he'd never mi&s;s half a crown out of all that &s;ilver."&mdash;"But to &s;teal," &s;aid Lawrence, drawing back with horror&mdash;"I never thought I &s;hould come to that&mdash;and from poor Jem too&mdash;the money that he has worked &s;o hard for too."&mdash;"But it is not &s;tealing; we don't mean to &s;teal; only to borrow it: and, if we win, as we certainly &s;hall, at the cock-fight, pay it back again, and he'll never know any thing of the matter; and what harm will it do him? Be&s;ides, what &s;igni|fies talking, you can't go to the cock-fight, or the fair either, if you don't; and I tell ye we don't mean to &s;teal it; we'll pay it again Mon|day night." Lawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to any determi|nation.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="102">
Here let us pau&s;e in our &s;tory&mdash;we are almo&s;t afraid to go on&mdash;the re&s;t is very &s;hocking&mdash;our little readers will &s;hudder as they read. But it is better that they &s;hould know the truth, and &s;ee what the idle boy came to at la&s;t.</P>
<P>In the dead of the night Lawrence heard &s;omebody tap at his window. He knew well who it was, for this was the &s;ignal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion. He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do, and lay quite &s;till, with his head under the bed-clothes, till he heard the &s;econd tap. Then he got up, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and opened his window. It was almo&s;t even with the ground. His companion &s;aid to him in a hol|low voice, "Are you ready." He made no an&s;wer, but got out of the window and follow|ed. When he got to the &s;table, a black cloud was ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ing over the moon, and it was quite dark. "Where are you?" whi&s;pered Law|rence, groping about, "where are you? Speak to me."&mdash;"I am here; give me your hand." Lawrence &s;tretched out his hand. "Is that your hand?" &s;aid the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; "how cold it felt."&mdash;"Let us go back," &s;aid Lawrence; "it is time yet."
<PB N="89" REF="103">&mdash;"It is no time to go back," replied the other opening the door; "you've gone too far now to go back:" and he pu&s;hed Lawrence into the &s;table.&mdash;"Have you found it&mdash;take care of the hor&s;e&mdash;have you done?&mdash;what are you about? &mdash;make ha&s;te, I hear a noi&s;e," &s;aid the &s;table|boy, who watched at the door. "I am feeling for the half crown, but I can't find it."&mdash; "Bring all together." He brought Jem's broken flower-pot, with all the money in it, to the door.</P>
<P>The black cloud was now pa&s;&s;ed over the moon, and the light &s;hone full upon them.&mdash; "What do we &s;tand here for?" &s;aid the &s;table|boy, &s;natching the flower-pot out of Lawrence's trembling hands, and pulled him away from the door. "Good God!" cried Lawrence, "you won't take all&mdash;you &s;aid you'd only take half a crown, and pay it back on Monday &mdash;you &s;aid you'd only take half a crown!"&mdash; "Hold your tongue," replied the other walk|ing on, deaf to all remon&s;trances&mdash;"if I am to be hanged ever, it &s;ha'n't be for half a crown." Lawrence's blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as if all his hair &s;tood on end. Not another word pa&s;&s;ed. His accomplice carried off the
<PB N="90" REF="104">money, and Lawrence crept, with all the hor|rors of guilt upon him, to his re&s;tle&s;s bed. All nigh he was &s;tarting from frightful dreams; or el&s;e, broad awake, he lay li&s;tening to every &s;mall noi&s;e, unable to &s;tir, and &s;carcely daring to breathe&mdash;tormented by that mo&s;t dreadful of all kinds of fear, that fear which is the con&s;tant companion of an evil con&s;cience. He thought the morning would never come; but when it was day, when he heard the birds &s;ing, and &s;aw every thing look cheerful as u&s;ual, he &s;elt &s;till more mi&s;crable. It was Sunday morning, and the bell rang for church. All the children of the village, dre&s;&s;ed in their Sunday clothes, in|nocent and gay, and little Jem, the be&s;t and gaye&s;t among&s;t them, went flocking by his door to church. "Well, Lawrence," &s;aid Jem, pulling his coat as he pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;aw Law|rence leaning again&s;t his father's door, "what makes you look &s;o black?"&mdash;"I!" &s;aid Law|rence &s;tarting, "why do you &s;ay that I look black?"&mdash;"Nay then," &s;aid Jem, "you look white enough, now, if that will plea&s;e you; for you're turned as pale as death."&mdash;"Pale!" replied Lawrence, not knowing what he &s;aid; and turned abruptly away, for he dared not
<PB N="91" REF="105">&s;tand another look of Jem's; con&s;cious that guilt was written in his &s;ace, he &s;hunned every eye. He would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay up|on his mind; he longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees, and confe&s;s all; dreading the moment when Jem &s;hould di&s;cover his lo&s;s, Lawrence dared not &s;tay at home, and not knowing what to do, or where to go, he me|chanically went to his old haunt at the &s;table|yard, and lurked thereabouts all day, with his accomplice, who tried in vain to quiet his fears and rai&s;e his &s;pirits, by talking of the next day's cock-fight. It was agreed, that, as &s;oon as the du&s;k of the evening came on, they &s;hould go together into a certain lonely field, and there divide their booty.</P>
<P>In the mean time Jem, when he returned from church, was very full of bu&s;ine&s;s, prepar|ing for the reception of his mi&s;tre&s;s, of who&s;e intended vi&s;it he had informed his mother; and, whil&s;t &s;he was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour, he ran to &s;earch the &s;traw|berry-beds. "Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!" &s;aid his mother when he came in with the &s;trawberries, and was jumping about
<PB N="92" REF="106">the room playfully. "Now keep tho&s;e &s;pirits of yours, Jem, till you want 'em, and don't let it come upon you all at once. Have it in mind that to-morrow's fair day, and Lightfoot mu&s;t go. I bid farmer Truck call for him to|night; he &s;aid he'd take him along with his own, and he'll be here ju&s;t now&mdash;and then I know how it will he with you, Jem!"&mdash;"So do I!" cried Jem, &s;wallowing his &s;ecret with great difficulty, and then tumbling head over heels four times running. A carriage pa&s;&s;ed the window and &s;topped at the door. Jem ran out; it was his mi&s;tre&s;s. She came in &s;miling, and &s;oon made the old woman &s;mile too, by prai&s;ing the neatne&s;s of every thing in the hou&s;e. But we &s;hall pa&s;s over, however important they were deemed at the time, the prai&s;es of the &s;trawberries, and of "my grandmother's china plate." Another knock was heard at the door. "Run, Jem," &s;aid his mother, "I hope it's our milk-woman with cream for the lady." No; it was farmer Truck come for Lightfoot. The old woman's countenance fell. "Fetch him out, dear," &s;aid &s;he, turning to her &s;on; but Jem was gone; he flew out to the &s;table the moment he &s;aw the flap of farmer Truck's
<PB N="93" REF="107">great-coat. "Sit ye down, farmer," &s;aid the old woman, after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of Jem's return. "You'd be&s;t &s;it down, if the lady will give you leave; for he'll not hurry him&s;elf back again. My boy's a fool, madam, about that there hor&s;e." Trying to laugh, &s;he added, "I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part&mdash;he won't bring him out till the la&s;t minute; &s;o do &s;it ye down, neighbour." The &s;armer had &s;carcely &s;at down, when Jem, with a pale wild countenance, came back. "What's the matter?" &s;aid his mi&s;tre&s;s. "God ble&s;s the boy!" &s;aid his mother, looking at him quite frightened, whil&s;t he tried to &s;peak, but could not. She went up to him, and then lean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng his head again&s;t her, he cried, "It's gone!&mdash;it's all gone!" and, bur&s;ting into tears, he &s;obbed as if his little heart would break. "What's gone, love?" &s;aid his mother. "My two guineas &mdash;Lightfoot's two guineas. I went to fetch 'em to give you, mammy; but the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all's gone! &mdash;quite gone!" repeated he, checking his &s;obs. "I &s;aw them &s;afe la&s;t night, and was &s;hewing 'em to Lightfoot; and I was &s;o glad to think I
<PB N="94" REF="108">had earned them all my&s;elf; and I thought how &s;urpri&s;ed you'd look, and how glad you'd be, and how you'd ki&s;s me, and all!"</P>
<P>His mother li&s;tened to him with the greate&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, whil&s;t his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;tood in &s;ilence, looking fir&s;t at the old woman, and then at Jem with a penetrating eye, as if &s;he &s;u&s;pected the truth of his &s;tory, and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compa&s;&s;ion. "This is a very &s;trange thing!" &s;aid &s;he gravely. "How came you to leave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the &s;table? How came you not to give it to your mother to take care of?"&mdash; "Why, don't you remember," &s;aid Jem, look|ing up in the mid&s;t of his tears; "why, don't you remember you your own &s;elf bid me not tell her about it till you were by."&mdash;"And did you not tell her?"&mdash;"Nay, a&s;k mammy," &s;aid Jem, a little offended; and, when after|wards the lady went on que&s;tioning him in a &s;evere manner, as if &s;he did not believe him, he at la&s;t made no an&s;wer. "Oh, Jem! Jem! why don't you &s;peak to the lady? &s;aid his mother. "I have &s;poke, and &s;poke the truth," &s;aid Jem proudly, "and &s;he did not believe me."</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="109">
Still the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be without &s;u&s;picion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to wait the event without interfering, &s;aying only, that &s;he hoped the money would be found; and advi&s;ed Jem to have done crying. "I have done," &s;aid Jem, "I &s;hall cry no more." And as he had the greate&s;t command over him&s;elf, he actually did not &s;hed another tear, not even when the farmer got up to go, &s;aying, he could wait no longer. Jem &s;ilently went to bring out Lightfoot.&mdash; The lady now took her &s;eat where &s;he could &s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed at the open parlour window. &mdash;The old woman &s;tood at the door, and &s;eve|ral idle people of the village, who had gathered round the lady's carriage examining it, turned about to li&s;ten. In a minute or two Jem ap|peared, with a &s;teady countenance, leading Lightfoot; and, when he came up, without &s;aying a word, put the bridle into farmer Truck's hand. "He <HI>has been</HI> a good hor&s;e," &s;aid the farmer. "He <HI>is</HI> a good hor&s;e!" cried Jem, and threw his arm over Lightfoot's neck, hiding his own face as he leaned upon him.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a party of milkwomen went by; and one of them having &s;et down her pail,
<PB N="96" REF="110">came behind Jem, and gave him a pretty &s;mart blow upon the back.&mdash;He looked up.&mdash;"And don't you know me?" &s;aid &s;he. "I forget," &s;aid Jem;" I think I have &s;een your face before, but I forget."&mdash;"Do you &s;o? and you'll tell me ju&s;t now," &s;aid &s;he, "half opening her hand, "that you forget who gave you this, and who charged you not to part with it too." Here &s;he quite opened her large hand, and on the palm of it appeared Jem's &s;ilver penny. "Where?" exclaimed Jem &s;eizing it, "oh where did you find it? and have you?&mdash;oh tell me, have you got the re&s;t of my money?"&mdash;"I know nothing of your money&mdash;I don't know what you would be at," &s;aid the milkwoman. "But where, pray tell me where, did you find this?"&mdash;"With them that you gave it to, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid the milkwoman, turning away &s;uddenly to take up her milk-pail. But now Jem's mi&s;tre&s;s called to her through the win|dow, begging her to &s;top, and joining in his entreaties to know how &s;he came by the &s;ilver penny.</P>
<P>"Why, madam," &s;aid &s;he, taking up the corner of her apron, "I came by it in an odd way too&mdash;You mu&s;t know my Betty is &s;ick, &s;o
<PB N="97" REF="111">I come with the milk my&s;elf, though it's not what I'm u&s;ed to; for my Betty&mdash;you know my Betty," &s;aid &s;he, turning round to the old woman, "my Betty &s;erves you, and &s;he's a tight and &s;tirring la&s;&s;y, ma'am, I can a&s;&s;ure&mdash;" "yes, I don't doubt it," &s;aid the lady impa|tiently; "but about the &s;ilver penny?"&mdash; "Why, that's true; as I was coming along all alone, for the re&s;t came round, and I came a &s;hort cut acro&s;s yon field&mdash;No, you can't &s;ee it, madam, where you &s;tand&mdash;but if you were here&mdash;" "I &s;ee it&mdash;I know it," &s;aid Jem, out of breath with anxiety. "Well&mdash;well&mdash;I re&s;t|ed my pail upon the &s;tile, and &s;ets me down awhile, and there comes out of the hedge&mdash;I don't know well how, for they &s;tartled me &s;o I'd like to have thrown down my milk&mdash;two boys, one about the &s;ize of he," &s;aid &s;he, point|ing to Jem, "and one a matter taller, but ill|looking like, &s;o I did not think to &s;tir to make way for them, and they were like in a de&s;perate hurry: &s;o, without waiting for the &s;tile, one of 'em pulled at the gate, and when it would not open (for it was tied with a pretty &s;tout cord) one of 'em whips out with his knife and cuts it&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="112">
"Now have you a knife about you, Sir?" continued the milk-woman to the farmer. He gave her his knife.</P>
<P>"Here now, ma'am, ju&s;t &s;ticking as it were here, between the blade and the haft, was the filver penny. He took no notice, but when he opened it, out it falls; &s;till he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I &s;aid before, and through the gate they went, and out of &s;ight in half a minute. I picks up the penny, for my heart mi&s;gave me that it was the very one hu&s;band had had a long time, and had given again&s;t my voice to he," pointing to Jem; "and I charg|ed him not to part with it; and, ma'am, when I looked I knew it by the mark, &s;o I thought I would &s;hew it to <HI>he,</HI>" again pointing to Jem, "and let him give it back to tho&s;e it belongs to."&mdash;"It belongs to me," &s;aid Jem, "I ne|ver gave it to any body&mdash;but&mdash;" "But," cried the farmer, "tho&s;e boys have robbed him &mdash;it is they who have all his money."&mdash;"Oh, which way did they go?" cried Jem, "I'll run after them."</P>
<P>"No, no," &s;aid the lady, calling to her &s;er|vant; and &s;he de&s;ired him to take his hor&s;e and ride after them. "Aye," added farmer Truck,
<PB N="99" REF="113" MS="y">do you take the road, and I'll take the field|way, and I'll be bound we'll have 'em pre|&s;ently."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were gone in pur&s;uit of the thieves, the lady, who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem's truth, de&s;ired her coach|man would produce what &s;he had ordered him to bring with him that evening. Out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new &s;addle and bridle.</P>
<P>How Jem's eyes &s;parkled when the &s;addle was thrown upon Lightfoot's back! "Put it on your hor&s;e your&s;elf, Jem," &s;aid the lady&mdash; "it is yours."</P>
<P>Con&s;u&s;ed reports of Lightfoot's &s;plendid ac|coutrements, of the pur&s;uit of thieves, and of the fine and generous lady who was &s;tanding at dame Pre&s;ton's window, quickly &s;pread through the village, and drew every body from their hou&s;es. They crowded round Jem to hear the &s;tory. The children e&s;pecially, who were all fond of him, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t indignation again&s;t the thieves. Every eye was on the &s;tretch; and now &s;ome, who had run down the lane, came back &s;houting, "Here they are! they've got the thieves!"</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="114">
The footman on hor&s;eback carried one boy before him; and the farmer, &s;triding along, dragged another. The latter had on a red jack|et, which little Jem immediately recollected, and &s;carcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on hor&s;eback. "Good God!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "it mu&s;t be&mdash;yet &s;urely it can't be Lawrence!" The footman rode on as fa&s;t as the people would let him. The boy's hat was flouched, and his head hung down, &s;o that no|body could &s;ee his face.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant there was a di&s;turbance in the crowd. A man who was half drunk pu&s;hed his way forwards, &s;wearing that nobody &s;hould &s;top him; that he had a right to &s;ee; and he <HI>would</HI> &s;ee. And &s;o he did; for, forcing through all re&s;i&s;tance, he &s;taggered up to the footman ju&s;t as he was lifting down the boy he had car|ried before him. "I <HI>will</HI>&mdash;I tell you I <HI>will</HI> &s;ee the thief!" cried the drunken man, pu&s;hing up the boy's hat.&mdash;It was his own &s;on.&mdash;"Law|rence!" exclaimed the wretched father. The &s;hock &s;obered him at once, and he hid his face in his hands.</P>
<P>There was an awful &s;ilence. Lawrence fell on his knees, and in a voice that could &s;carcely
<PB N="101" REF="115">be heard made a full confe&s;&s;ion of all the cir|cum&s;tances of his guilt. "Such a young crea|ture &s;o wicked! What could put &s;uch wicked|ne&s;s into your head?"&mdash;"Bad company," &s;aid Lawrence. "And how came you&mdash;what brought you into bad company?"&mdash;"I don't know&mdash;except it was idlene&s;s." While this was &s;aying, the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence's pockets; and when the money ap|peared, all his former companions in the village looked at each other with a&s;toni&s;hment and ter|ror. Their parents gra&s;ped their little hands clo&s;er, and cried, "Thank God! he is not my &s;on&mdash;how often, when he was little, we u&s;ed, as he lounged about, to tell him that idlene&s;s was the root of all evil."</P>
<P>As for the hardened wretch his accomplice, every one was impatient to have him &s;ent to gaol. He had put on a bold, in&s;olent counte|nance, till he heard Lawrence's confe&s;&s;ion; till the money was found upon him; and he heard the milk-woman declare, that &s;he would &s;wear to the &s;ilver penny which he had dropped. Then he turned pale, and betrayed the &s;tronge&s;t &s;igns of fear. "We mu&s;t take him before the
<PB N="102" REF="116">ju&s;tice," &s;aid the farmer, "and he'll be lodged in Bri&s;tol gaol. "Oh!" &s;aid Jem, &s;pringing forwards when Lawrence's hands were going to be tied, "let him go&mdash;won't you&mdash;can't you let him go?"&mdash;"Yes, madam, for mer|cy's &s;ake," &s;aid Jem's mother to the lady, "think what a di&s;grace to his family to be &s;ent to gaol." His father &s;tood by wringing his hands in an agony of de&s;pair. "It's all my fault," cried he; "I brought him up in <HI>idle|ne&s;s.</HI>" &mdash;"But he'll never be idle any more," &s;aid Jem; won't you &s;peak for him, ma'am?"&mdash; "Don't a&s;k the lady to &s;peak for him," &s;aid the farmer; "it's better he &s;hould go to bridewell now, than to the gallows by and by."</P>
<P>Nothing more was &s;aid, for every body felt the truth of the farmer's &s;peech. Lawrence was &s;ent to bridewell for a month, and the &s;ta|ble-boy was tran&s;ported to Botany Bay.</P>
<P>During Lawrence's confinement, Jem often vi&s;ited him, and carried him &s;uch little pre&s;ents as he could afford to give; and Jem could af|ford to be <HI>generous,</HI> becau&s;e he was <HI>indu&s;trious.</HI> Lawrence's heart was touched by his kindne&s;s, and his example &s;truck him &s;o forcibly, that, when his confinement was ended, he re&s;olved
<PB N="103" REF="117">to &s;et immediately to work; and, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of all who knew him, &s;oon became remarkable for indu&s;try: he was found early and late at his work, e&s;tabli&s;hed a new charac|ter, and for ever lo&s;t the name of <HI>Lazy Law|rence.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE FALSE KEY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. SPENCER, a very benevolent and &s;en|&s;ible man, undertook the education of &s;everal poor children. Among&s;t the re&s;t was a boy of the name of Franklin, whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old. Franklin had the misfortune to be the &s;on of a man of infamous character; and for many years this was a di&s;grace and reproach to his child. When any of the neighbours' children quarrelled with him, they u&s;ed to tell him he would turn out like his father. But Mr. Spencer always a&s;|&s;ured him, that he might make him&s;elf what|ever he plea&s;ed; that by behaving well he would certainly, &s;ooner or later, &s;ecure the e&s;|teem and love of all who knew him, even of tho&s;e who had the &s;tronge&s;t prejudice again&s;t him on his father's account.</P>
<P>This hope was very delightful to Franklin, and he &s;hewed the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire to learn and to do every thing that was right; &s;o that Mr. Spencer &s;oon grew fond of him, and took great
<PB N="105" REF="119">pains to in&s;truct him, and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a u&s;eful, re&s;pectable, and happy man.</P>
<P>When he was about thirteen years of age, Mr. Spencer one day &s;ent for him into his clo|&s;et; and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing, &s;aid to him with a very kind look, but in a graver tone than u&s;ual, "Frank|lin, you are going to leave me."&mdash;"Sir!" &s;aid Franklin. "You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world for your&s;elf. You will carry this letter to my &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Churchill, in Queen's Square&mdash;you know Queen's Square." Franklin bowed. "You mu&s;t expect," con|tinued Mr. Spencer, "to meet with &s;everal di&s;agreeable things, and a great deal of rough work, at your fir&s;t &s;etting out; but be faithful and obedient to your mi&s;tre&s;s, and obliging to your fellow-&s;ervants, and all will go well. Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mi&s;tre&s;s if you behave properly, and I have no doubt but you will."&mdash;"Thank you, Sir."&mdash;"And you will always (I mean as long as you de&s;erve it) find a friend in me."&mdash;"Thank you, Sir&mdash; I am &s;ure you are&mdash;" There Franklin &s;top|ped &s;hort, for the recollection of all Mr. Spen|cer's
<PB N="106" REF="120">goodne&s;s ru&s;hed upon him at once, and he could not &s;ay another word. "Bring me a candle to &s;eal this letter," &s;aid his ma&s;ter; and he was very glad to get out of the room. He came back with the candle, and with a &s;tout heart &s;tood by whil&s;t the letter was &s;ealing; and when his ma&s;ter put it into his hand, &s;aid, in a cheerful voice, "I hope you will let me &s;ee you again, Sir, &s;ometimes." &mdash; "Certainly: whenever your mi&s;tre&s;s can &s;pare you I &s;hall be very glad to &s;ee you; and, remember, if ever you get into any difficulty, don't be afraid to come to me. I have &s;ometimes &s;poken har&s;hly to you, but you will not meet with a more in|dulgent friend." Franklin at this turned away with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to expre&s;s his gratitude, left the room without being able to &s;peak.</P>
<P>He got to Queen's Square about three o'clock. The door was opened by a large red-faced man in a blue coat and &s;carlet wai&s;tcoat, to whom he felt afraid to give his me&s;&s;age, le&s;t he &s;hould not be a &s;ervant. "Well, what's your bu&s;i|ne&s;s, Sir?" &s;aid the butler. "I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, <HI>Sir,</HI>" &s;aid Franklin, endea|vouring to pronounce his <HI>Sir</HI> in a tone as re|&s;pectful
<PB N="107" REF="121">as the butler's was in&s;olent. The man having examined the direction, &s;eal, and edges of the letter, carried it up &s;tairs, and in a few minutes returned, and ordered Franklin to rub his &s;hoes well and follow him. He was then &s;hewn into a hand&s;ome room, where he found his mi&s;tre&s;s, an elderly lady. She a&s;ked him a few que&s;tions, examining him attentively as &s;he &s;poke; and her &s;evere eye at fir&s;t, and her gra|cious &s;mile afterwards, made him feel that &s;he was a per&s;on to be both loved and feared. "I &s;hall give you in charge," &s;aid &s;he, ringing a bell, "to my hou&s;ekeeper, and I hope &s;he will have no rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with you."</P>
<P>The hou&s;ekeeper, when &s;he fir&s;t came in, appeared with a &s;miling countenance; but the moment &s;he ca&s;t her eyes on Franklin, it chang|ed to a look of &s;urpri&s;e and &s;u&s;picion. Her mi&s;tre&s;s recommended him to her protection, &s;aying, "Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your own eye." And &s;he received him with a cold "very well, ma'am;" which plain|ly &s;hewed &s;he was not di&s;po&s;ed to like him. In fact Mrs. Pomfret was a woman &s;o fond of power, and &s;o jealous of favour, that &s;he would have quarrelled with an angel who had got &s;o
<PB N="108" REF="122">near her mi&s;tre&s;s without her introduction. She &s;mothered her di&s;plea&s;ure, however, till night; when, as &s;he attended her mi&s;tre&s;'s toi|lette, &s;he could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing her &s;entiments. She began cautiou&s;ly: "Ma'am, is not this the boy Mr. Spencer was talking of one day&mdash;that has been brought up by the <HI>Villaintropic Society,</HI> I think they call it?"&mdash;"Phi|lanthropic Society; yes; and my brother gives him a high character: I hope he will do very well."&mdash;"I'm &s;ure I hope &s;o too; but I can't &s;ay; for my part, I've no great notion of tho&s;e low people. They &s;ay all tho&s;e children are taken from the very lowe&s;t <HI>drugs</HI> and <HI>refugees</HI> of the town, and &s;urely they are like enough, ma'am, to take after their own fathers and mo|thers."&mdash;"But they are not &s;uffered to be with their parents, and therefore cannot be hurt by their example. This little boy to be &s;ure was unfortunate in his father, but he has had an ex|cellent education."&mdash;"Oh, <HI>edication!</HI> to be &s;ure, ma'am, I know&mdash;I don't &s;ay but what <HI>edication</HI> is a great thing. But then, ma'am, <HI>edication</HI> can't change the <HI>natur</HI> that's in one, they &s;ay; and one that's born naturally bad and low, they &s;ay, all the <HI>edication</HI> in the world
<PB N="109" REF="123">won't do no good; and, for my part, ma'am, I know you knows be&s;t, but I &s;hould be afraid to let any of tho&s;e <HI>Villaintropic</HI> folks get into my hou&s;e, for nobody can tell the <HI>natur</HI> of them aforehand: I declare it frights me."&mdash;"Pom|fret, I thought you had better &s;en&s;e: how would this poor boy earn his bread? he would be forced to &s;tarve or &s;teal if every body had &s;uch pre|judices." Pomfret, who really was a good wo|man, was &s;oftened at this idea, and &s;aid, "God forbid he &s;hould &s;tarve or &s;teal, and God forbid I &s;hould &s;ay any thing <HI>prejudiciary</HI> of the boy, for there may be no harm in him."&mdash;"Well," &s;aid Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone, "but, Pomfret, if we don't like the boy at the end of a month, we have done with him; for I have only promi&s;ed Mr. Spencer to keep him a month upon trial&mdash;there is no harm done."&mdash; "Dear, no, ma'am, to be &s;ure&mdash;and cook mu&s;t put up with her di&s;appointment, that's all."&mdash; "What di&s;appointment?"&mdash;"About her ne|phew, ma'am; the boy &s;he and I was &s;peaking to you for."&mdash;"When?"&mdash;"The day you called her up about the almond pudding, ma'am; if you remember, you &s;aid you &s;hould have no objections to try the boy; and upon that cook
<PB N="110" REF="124">bought him new &s;hirts; but they are to the good, as I tell her."&mdash;"But I did not promi&s;e to take her nephew."&mdash;"Oh, no, ma'am, not at all; &s;he does not think to <HI>&s;ay that,</HI> el&s;e I &s;hould be very angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word, any more than frets that the boy &s;hould mi&s;s &s;uch a good place."&mdash; "Well, but &s;ince I did &s;ay that I &s;hould have no objection to try him, I &s;hall keep my word; let him come to-morrow: let them both have a fair trial, and at the end of the month I can decide which I like be&s;t, and which we have bet|ter keep."</P>
<P>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the&s;e orders, Mrs. Pomfret ha&s;tened to report all that had pa&s;&s;ed to the cook, like a favourite mini&s;ter; proud to di&s;|play the extent of her &s;ecret influence. In the morning Felix, the cook's nephew, arrived; and the moment he came into the kitchen every eye, even the &s;cullion's, was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced upon Franklin with contempt&mdash;contempt which Franklin could not endure without &s;ome confu|&s;ion, though quite uncon&s;cious of having de&s;erv|ed it; nor, upon the mo&s;t impartial and cool &s;elf-examination, could be comprehend the ju&s;|tice
<PB N="111" REF="125">of his judges. He perceived indeed, for the compari&s;ons were minutely made in audible and &s;cornful whi&s;pers, that Felix was a much hand&s;omer, or, as the kitchen-maid expre&s;&s;ed it, a much more genteeler gentlemanly-looking like &s;ort of per&s;on than he was; and he was made to under&s;tand, that he wanted a frill to his &s;hirt, a cravat, a pair of thin &s;hoes, and, above all, &s;hoe-&s;trings, be&s;ides other namele&s;s advantages, which ju&s;tly made his rival the ad|miration of the kitchen. However, upon call|ing to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer had ever &s;aid to him, he could not recollect his having warned him that &s;hoe-&s;trings were in|di&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ites to the character of a good &s;ervant; &s;o that he could only comfort him&s;elf with re&s;olving, if po&s;&s;ible, to make amends for the&s;e deficiencies, and to di&s;&s;ipate the prejudices which he &s;aw were formed again&s;t him, by the &s;tricte&s;t adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty. He hoped to &s;ecure the approbation of his mi&s;tre&s;s by &s;crupulous obedience to all her commands, and faithful care of all that belonged to her; at the &s;ame time he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould win the good will of his fellow-&s;ervants, by &s;hewing a con|&s;tant
<PB N="112" REF="126">de&s;ire to oblige them. He pur&s;ued this plan of conduct &s;teadily for nearly three weeks, and found that he &s;ucceeded beyond his expecta|tions in plea&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s; but unfortu|nately he found it more difficult to plea&s;e his fellow &s;ervants, and he &s;ometimes offended when he lea&s;t expected it.</P>
<P>He had made great progre&s;s in the affections of Cork&s;crew the butler, by working indeed very hard for him, and doing every day at lea&s;t half his bu&s;ine&s;s. But one unfortunate night the butler was gone out&mdash;the bell rang&mdash;he went up &s;tairs; and his mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;king where Cork&s;crew was, he an&s;wered that he was gone out. "Where to?" &s;aid his mi&s;tre&s;s. "I don't know," an&s;wered Franklin. And as he had told exactly the truth, and meant to do no harm, he was &s;urpri&s;ed, at the butler's return, when he repeated to him what had pa&s;&s;ed, to receive a &s;udden box on the ear, and the appel|lation of a mi&s;chievous, impertinent, mean-&s;pirit|ed brat! "Mi&s;chievous, impertinent, mean!" repeated Franklin to him&s;elf; but, looking in the butler's face, which was of a deeper &s;carlet than u&s;ual, he judged that he was far from &s;o|ber, and did not doubt but that the next morn|ing,
<PB N="113" REF="127">when he came to the u&s;e of his rea&s;on, he would be &s;en&s;ible of his inju&s;tice, and apologize for this box of the ear. But no apology coming all day, Franklin at la&s;t ventured to reque&s;t an explanation, or rather to a&s;k what he had be&s;t do on the next occa&s;ion. "Why," &s;aid Cork|&s;crew, "when mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;ked for me, how came you to &s;ay I was gone out?"&mdash;"Becau&s;e you know, I &s;aw you go out."&mdash;"And when &s;he a&s;ked you where I was gone, how came you to &s;ay that you did not know?&mdash;"Becau&s;e in|deed I did not."&mdash;"You are a &s;tupid block-head: could not you &s;ay I was gone to the wa&s;herwoman's?"&mdash;"But <HI>were</HI> you?" &s;aid Franklin. "Was I!" cried Cork&s;crew, and looked as if he would have &s;truck him again; "how dare you give me the lie?&mdash;Mr. Hypo|crite, you would be ready enough, I'll be bound, to make excu&s;es for your&s;elf.&mdash;Why are not mi&s;tre&s;s's clogs cleaned? go along and blacken 'em this minute, and &s;end Felix to me.</P>
<P>From this time forward Felix alone was pri|vileged to enter the butler's pantry. Felix be|came the favourite of Cork&s;crew; and though Franklin by no means &s;ought to pry into the my&s;teries of their private conferences, nor ever
<PB N="114" REF="128">entered without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once to be &s;ent of a me&s;&s;age at an unluckly time, and as the door was half open he could not avoid &s;eeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor, which he could not help &s;u&s;pect|ing to be wine; and as the decanter, which u&s;ually went up &s;tairs after dinner, was at this time in the butler's gra&s;p, without any &s;topper in it, he was involuntarily forced to &s;u&s;pect they were drinking his mi&s;tre&s;s's wine.</P>
<P>Nor were the bumpers of port of the only un|lawful rewards which Felix received; his aunt the cook had occa&s;ion for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;he had many delicious douceurs in her gift. Many a handful of currants, many a half cu&s;tard, many a triangular remnant of pie, be&s;ides the choice of his own meal at breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li to the &s;hare of the favourite Felix; whil&s;t Franklin was neglected, though he took the utmo&s;t pains to plea&s;e the cook in all ho|nourable &s;ervice, and, when &s;he was hot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand to help her; and in the hour of adver&s;ity, when the clock &s;truck five, and no dinner was di&s;hed, and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had, Franklin would an&s;wer to her call, with
<PB N="115" REF="129">flowers to garni&s;h her di&s;hes, and pre&s;ence of mind to know, in the mid&s;t of the commotion, where every thing that was wanting was to be found; &s;o that, quick as lightning, all difficul|ties vani&s;hed before him. Yet when the dan|ger was over, and the hour of adver&s;ity pa&s;&s;ed, the ungrateful cook would forget her bene|factor, and, when it came to be his &s;upper time, would throw him, with a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s which touched him &s;en&s;ibly, any thing which the other &s;ervants were too nice to eat. All this Frank|lin bore with fortitude, nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he eat &s;ometimes clo&s;e be&s;ide him: "For," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I have a clear con&s;cience, and that is more than Felix can have. I know how he wins cook's fa|vour too well, and I fancy I know how I have offended her; for, &s;ince the day I &s;aw the ba&s;ket, &s;he has done nothing but huff me."</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the ba&s;ket was this. Mrs. Pomfret, the hou&s;ekeeper, had &s;everal times, directly and indirectly, given the world below to under&s;tand that &s;he and her mi&s;tre&s;s thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late. Now when &s;he &s;poke, it
<PB N="116" REF="130">was u&s;ually at dinner-time; &s;he always looked, or Franklin imagined that &s;he looked, &s;u&s;pi|ciou&s;ly at him. Other people looked &s;till more maliciou&s;ly; but as he felt him&s;elf perfectly in|nocent, he went on eating his dinner in &s;ilence. But at length it was time to explain. One Sunday there appeared a hand&s;ome &s;irloin of beef, which before noon on Monday had &s;hrunk almo&s;t to the bare bone, and pre&s;ented &s;uch a deplorable &s;pectacle to the opening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret, that her long &s;mothered indignation bur&s;t forth, and &s;he boldly declared &s;he was now certain there had been foul play, and &s;he would have the beef found, or &s;he would know why. She &s;poke, but no beef appeared; till Franklin, with a look of &s;udden recollection, cried, "Did not I &s;ee &s;omething like a piece of beef in a ba&s;ket in the dairy&mdash;I think&mdash;" The cook, as if &s;omebody had &s;mote her a deadly blow, grew pale; but &s;uddenly recovering the u&s;e of her &s;peech, turned upon Franklin, and with a voice of thunder gave him the lie direct; and forth|with, taking Mrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declaring &s;he could defy the world&mdash;"that &s;o &s;he could, and would." &mdash;"There, ma'am," &s;aid &s;he, kicking an empty
<PB N="117" REF="131">ba&s;ket which lay on the floor&mdash;"there's malice for you&mdash;a&s;k him why he don't &s;hew you the beef in the ba&s;ket."&mdash;"I thought I &s;aw&mdash;" poor Franklin began. "You thought you &s;aw!" cried the cook coming clo&s;e up to him with kimboed arms, and looking like a dragon. &mdash;"And pray, Sir, what bu&s;ine&s;s have &s;uch a one as you to think you &s;ee?"&mdash;"And pray, ma'am, will you be plea&s;ed to &s;peak&mdash;perhaps, ma'am, he'll conde&s;cend to obey you&mdash;ma'am, will you be plea&s;ed to forbid him my dairy&mdash; for here he comes prying and &s;pying about&mdash; and how, ma'am, am I to an&s;wer for my butter and cream, or any thing at all?&mdash;I'm &s;ure it's what I can't pretend to, unle&s;s you do me the ju&s;tice to forbid him my places."</P>
<P>Mrs. Pomfret, who&s;e eyes were blinded by her prejudices again&s;t the folks of the <HI>Villain|tropic Society,</HI> and al&s;o by her &s;ecret jealou&s;ly of a boy whom &s;he deemed to be a growing fa|vourite of her mi&s;tre&s;s's, took part with the cook, and ended, as &s;he began, with a firm per|&s;ua&s;ion that Franklin was the guilty per&s;on. "Let him alone, let him alone!" &s;aid &s;he; "he has as many turns and windings as a hare; but we &s;hall catch him yet, I'll be bound, in
<PB N="118" REF="132">&s;ome of his doublings. I knew the nature of him well enough, from the fir&s;t time I ever &s;et my eyes upon him; but mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hall have her own way, and &s;ee the end of it." The&s;e words, and the bitter &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice, drew tears at length fa&s;t down the proud cheek of Franklin, which might po&s;&s;ibly have touched Mrs. Pom|fret, if Felix, with a &s;neer, had not called them <HI>crocodile tears.</HI> "Felix too!" thought he, "this is too much." In fact Felix had till now profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf his firm ally, and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friend&s;hip; for it mu&s;t be told, that every other morning, when it was Felix's turn to get breakfa&s;t, Felix never was up in decent time, and mu&s;t inevitably have come to public di&s;|grace, if Franklin had not got all the breakfa&s;t things ready for him, the bread and butter &s;pread and the toa&s;t toa&s;ted; and had not moreover re|gularly, when the clock &s;truck eight, and Mrs. Pomfret's foot was heard overhead, ran to call the &s;leeping Felix, and helped him con&s;tantly through the hurry of getting dre&s;&s;ed one in&s;tant before the hou&s;ekeeper came down &s;tairs. All this could not but be pre&s;ent to his memory; but, &s;corning to reproach him, Franklin wiped
<PB N="119" REF="133">away his crocodile tears, and pre&s;erved a mag|nanimous &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The hour of retribution was however not &s;o far off as Felix imagined. Cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for &s;ome time, but though they may e&s;cape once, twice, perhaps ninety-nine times, what does that &s;ignify, for the hundredth they come to &s;hame, and lo&s;e all their character. Grown bold by frequent &s;ucce&s;s, Felix became more carele&s;s in his operations; and it happened that one day he met his mi&s;tre&s;s full in the pa&s;&s;age, as he was going on one of the cook's &s;ecret errands. "Where are you going, Felix?" &s;aid his mi&s;tre&s;s. "To the wa&s;herwoman's, ma'am," an&s;wered he with his u&s;ual effrontery. "Very well," &s;aid &s;he, "call at the book&s;eller's in &mdash; &s;tay, I mu&s;t write down the direction.&mdash; Pomfret," &s;aid &s;he, opening the hou&s;ekeeper's room door, "have you a bit of paper." Pom|fret came with the writing-paper, and looked very angry to &s;ee that Felix was going out without her knowledge; &s;o, while Mrs. Churchill was writing the direction, &s;he &s;tood talking to him about it; whil&s;t he, in the great|e&s;t terror imaginable, looked up in her face as
<PB N="120" REF="134">&s;he &s;poke, but was all the time intent upon parry|ing on the other &s;ide the attacks of a little French dog of his mi&s;tre&s;'s, which, unluckily for him, had followed her into the pa&s;&s;age. Manchon was extremely fond of Felix, who, by way of plea&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s, had paid mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous court to her dog; yet now his care&s;&s;es were rather trouble&s;ome. Manchon leaped up, and was not to be rebuffed. "Poor fellow, poor fellow &mdash; down! down! poor fellow!" cried Felix, and put him away. But Manchon leaped up again, and began &s;melling near the fatal pocket in a mo&s;t alarming manner. "You will &s;ee by this direction where you are to go," &s;aid his mi&s;tre&s;s. "Manchon, come here&mdash; and you will be &s;o good as to bring me &mdash; down! down! Manchon, be quiet!" But Manchon knew better; he had now got his head into Felix's pocket, and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence, ru&s;tling out of its brown paper, half a cold turkey, which had been mi&s;&s;ing &s;ince morning. "My cold tur|key, as I'm alive!" exclaimed the hou&s;ekeeper, darting upon it with horror and amazement. "What is all this?" &s;aid Mrs. Churchill in a compo&s;ed voice. "I don't know, ma'am,"
<PB N="121" REF="135">an&s;wered Felix, &s;o confu&s;ed that he knew not what to &s;ay&mdash;"but&mdash;" "But what?" cried Mrs. Pomfret, indignation fla&s;hing from her eyes. "But what?" repeated his mi&s;tre&s;s, waiting for his reply with a calm air of atten|tion, which &s;till more di&s;concerted Felix; for though with an angry per&s;on he might have &s;ome chance of e&s;cape, he knew that he could not invent any excu&s;e in &s;uch circum&s;tances which could &s;tand the examination of a per&s;on in her &s;ober &s;en&s;es. He was &s;truck dumb. "Speak," &s;aid Mrs. Churchill, in a &s;till lower tone; "I am ready to hear all you have to &s;ay: in my hou&s;e every body &s;hall have ju&s;tice&mdash; &s;peak&mdash;but what?"&mdash;<HI>"But,"</HI> &s;tammered Fe|lix; and, after in vain attempting to equivocate, confe&s;&s;ed that he was going to take the turkey to his cou&s;in's: but he threw all the blame upon his aunt, the cook, who, he &s;aid, had or|dered him upon this expedition. The cook was now &s;ummoned; but &s;he totally denied all knowledge of the affair, with the &s;ame violence with which &s;he had lately confounded Franklin about the beef in the ba&s;ket; not entirely, how|ever, with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, for Felix, perceiv|ing by his mi&s;tre&s;s eye that &s;he was upon the
<PB N="122" REF="136">point of de&s;iring him to leave the hou&s;e imme|diately, and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived &s;o well with the butler, did not he&s;itate to confront his aunt with a&s;&s;urance equal to her own. He knew how to bring his charge home to her. He pro|duced a note in her own hand-writing, the purport of which was to reque&s;t her cou&s;in's acceptance of "&s;ome <HI>delicate cold turkey,</HI>" and to beg &s;he would &s;end her by the return of the bearer a little of her cherry-brandy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook's di&s;charge, and informed Felix &s;he had no further occa&s;ion for his &s;er|vices; but, upon his pleading with many tears, which Franklin did not call <HI>crocodile tears,</HI> that he was &s;o young, and that he was under the dominion of his aunt, he touched Mrs. Pom|fret's compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he obtained for him per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;tay till the end of the month, to give him yet a chance of redeeming his cha|racter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pomfret, now &s;eeing how far &s;he had been impo&s;ed upon, re&s;olved for the future to be more upon her guard with Felix, and felt that &s;he had treated Franklin with great inju&s;|tice,
<PB N="123" REF="137">when &s;he accu&s;ed him of mal-practices about the &s;irloin of beef. Good people, when they are made &s;en&s;ible that they have treated any one with inju&s;tice, are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mi&s;take; and Mrs. Pomfret was now prepared to &s;ee every thing which Franklin did in the mo&s;t favour|able point of view, e&s;pecially as the next day &s;he di&s;covered that it was he who every morn|ing boiled the water for her tea, and buttered her toa&s;t, &s;ervices for which &s;he had always thought &s;he was indebted to Felix. Be&s;ides, &s;he had rated Felix's abilities very highly, be|cau&s;e he made up her weekly accounts for her; but unluckily once, when Franklin was out of the way, and &s;he brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to ca&s;t up, &s;he di&s;covered that he did not know how to ca&s;t up pounds, &s;hillings, and pence, and he was obliged to confe&s;s that he mu&s;t wait till Franklin came home.</P>
<P>But, pa&s;&s;ing over a number of &s;mall incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys, we mu&s;t proceed to a more &s;erious affair.</P>
<P>Cork&s;crew, frequently, after he had fini&s;hed taking away &s;upper, and after the hou&s;ekeeper
<PB N="124" REF="138">was gone to bed, &s;allied forth to a neighbouring alehou&s;e to drink with his friends. The ale|hou&s;e was kept by that cou&s;in of Felix's who was &s;o fond of "<HI>delicate</HI> cold turkey," and who had &s;uch choice cherry-brandy. Cork&s;crew kept the key of the hou&s;e door, &s;o that he could return home at what hour he thought proper; and, if he &s;hould by accident be called for by his mi&s;tre&s;s after &s;upper, Felix knew where to find him, and did not &s;cruple to make any of tho&s;e excu&s;es which poor Franklin had too much integrity to u&s;e. All the&s;e precau|tions taken, the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;o increa&s;ed with indulgence, that his wages were by no means &s;ufficient to &s;upport him in this way of life. Every day he felt le&s;s re&s;olution to break through his bad habits, for every day drinking become more nece&s;&s;ary to him. His health was ruined. With a red, pimpled, bloated face, emaciated legs, and a &s;welled, di&s;ea&s;ed body, he appeared the victim of intoxication. In the morning when he got up his hands trembled, his &s;pirits &s;lagged, he could do nothing till he had taken a dram; an operation which he was oblig|ed to repeat &s;everal times in the cour&s;e of the
<PB N="125" REF="139">day, as all tho&s;e wretched people <HI>mu&s;t</HI> who once acquire this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>He had run up a long bill at the alehou&s;e which he frequented; and the landlord, who grew urgent for his money, refu&s;ed to give him further credit. One night, when Corck&s;crew had drank enough only to make him fretful, he leaned with his elbow &s;urlily upon the table, began to quarrel with the landlord, and &s;wore that he had not of late treated him like a gen|tleman. To which the landlord coolly replied, "That as long as he had paid like a gentleman, he had been treated like one, and <HI>that</HI> was as much as any one could expect, or, at any rate, as much as any one would meet with, in this world." For the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion he appealed, laughing, to a party of men who were drinking in the room. The men, however, took part with Cork&s;crew, and, drawing him over to their table, made him &s;it down with them. They were in high good humour, and the butler &s;oon grew &s;o intimate with them, that, in the openne&s;s of his heart, he &s;oon com|municated to them, not only all his own affairs, but all that he knew, and more than all that he knew, of his mi&s;tre&s;s's.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="140">
His new friends were by no means uninte|re&s;ted in his conver&s;ation, and encouraged him as much as po&s;&s;ible to talk; for they had &s;ecret views, which the butler was by no means &s;uf|ficiently &s;ober to di&s;cover. Mrs. Churchill had &s;ome fine old family plate; and the&s;e men belonged to a gang of hou&s;ebreakers. Before they parted with Cork&s;crew, they engaged him to meet them again the next night; their inti|macy was &s;till more clo&s;ely cemented. One of the men actually offered to lend Cork&s;crew three guineas towards the payment of his debt, and hinted that, if he thought proper, he could ea&s;ily get the whole cleared off. Upon this hint Cork&s;crew be came all attention, till, after &s;ome he&s;itation on their part, and repeated promi&s;es of &s;ecre&s;y on his, they at length di&s;clo&s;ed their plans to him. They gave him to under&s;tand, that if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t in letting them into his mi&s;tre&s;'s hou&s;e, they would let him have an ample &s;hare in the booty. The butler, who had the reputation of being an hone&s;t man, and indeed who&s;e integrity had hitherto been proof again&s;t every thing but his mi&s;tre&s;'s port, turn|ed pale and trembled at this propo&s;al; drank
<PB N="127" REF="141">two or three bumpers to drown thought; and promi&s;ed to give an an&s;wer the next day.</P>
<P>He went home more than half intoxicated. His mind was &s;o full of what had pa&s;&s;ed, that he could not help bragging to Felix, whom he found awake at his return, that he could have his bill paid off at the alehou&s;e whenever he plea&s;ed; dropping be&s;ides &s;ome hints, which were not lo&s;t upon Felix. In the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had &s;aid; and Cork&s;crew, alarmed, endeavoured to evade his que&s;tions, by &s;aying that he was not in his &s;en&s;es when he talked in that manner. Nothing however that he could urge made any impre&s;&s;ion upon Felix, who&s;e recollection on the &s;ubject was perfectly di&s;tinct, and who had too much cunning him&s;elf, and too little con|fidence in his companion, to be the dupe of his di&s;&s;imulation. The butler knew not what to do when he &s;aw that Felix was ab&s;olutely de|termined either to betray their &s;cheme, or to become a &s;harer in the booty.</P>
<P>The next night came, and he was now to make a final deci&s;ion; either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaint|ance,
<PB N="128" REF="142">or taking Felix with him to join in the plot.</P>
<P>His debt, his love of drinking, the impo&s;&s;i|bility of indulging it without a fre&s;h &s;upply of money, all came into his mind at once, and conquered his remaining &s;cruples. It is &s;aid by tho&s;e who&s;e fatal experience give them a right to be believed, that a drunkard will &s;acri|fice any thing, every thing, &s;ooner than the plea&s;ure of habitual intoxication.</P>
<P>How much ea&s;ier is it never to begin a bad cu&s;tom, than to break through it when once formed!</P>
<P>The hour of rendezvous came, and Cork|&s;crew went to the alehou&s;e, where he found the hou&s;e-breakers waiting for him, and a gla&s;s of brandy ready poured out. He &s;ighed&mdash;drank &mdash;he&s;itated&mdash;drank again&mdash;heard the landlord talk of his bill&mdash;&s;aw the money produced, which would pay it in a moment &mdash; drank again &mdash; cur&s;ed him&s;elf, and, giving his hand to the vil|lain who was whi&s;pering in his ear, &s;wore that he could not help it, and mu&s;t do as they would have him. They required of him to give up the key of the hou&s;e-door, that they might get another made by it. He had left it with Felix,
<PB N="129" REF="143">and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had ari&s;en. Felix knew enough to ruin them, and mu&s;t therefore be won over. This was no very difficult ta&s;k; he had a &s;trong de&s;ire to have &s;ome worked cravats, and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a &s;ufficient bribe. The cravats were bought and &s;hewn to Felix. He thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete fine gentleman, and to go without them, e&s;pecially when he had once &s;een him&s;elf in the gla&s;s with one tied on in a &s;plendid bow, appeared impo&s;|&s;ible. Even this paltry temptation, working upon his vanity, at length prevailed with a boy, who&s;e integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily fal&s;ehood. It was agreed that, the fir&s;t time his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ent him out on a me&s;&s;age, he &s;hould carry the key of the hou&s;e door to his cou&s;in's, and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang, who were there in waiting for it. Such was the &s;cheme. Felix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; but the butler, who had not yet &s;tifled the voice of con&s;cience, felt, in the &s;ilence of the night, &s;o in&s;upport|ably mi&s;erable, that, in&s;tead of going to re&s;t, he
<PB N="130" REF="144">&s;tole &s;oftly into the pantry for a bottle of his mi&s;tre&s;s's wine, and there, drinking gla&s;s after gla&s;s, he &s;tayed till he became &s;o far intoxicated that, though he contrived to find his way back to bed, he could by no means undre&s;s him&s;elf. Without any power of recollection, he flung him&s;elf upon the bed, leaving his candle half hanging out of the candle&s;tick be&s;ide him. Franklin &s;lept in the next room to him, and pre&s;ently wakening, thought he perceived a &s;trong &s;mell of &s;omething burning. He jump|ed up, and &s;eeing a light under the butler's door, gently opened it, and to his a&s;toni&s;hment beheld one of the bed curtains in flames. He immediately ran to the butler, and pulled him with all his force to rou&s;e him from his lethar|gy. He came to his &s;en&s;es at length, but was &s;o terrified, and &s;o helple&s;s, that, if it had not been for Franklin, the whole hou&s;e would &s;oon inevitably have been on fire. Felix, trembling and cowardly, knew not what to do; and it was curious to &s;ee him obeying Franklin, who&s;e turn it was now to command. Franklin ran up &s;tairs to waken Mrs. Pomfret, who&s;e terror of fire was &s;o great that &s;he came from her room almo&s;t out of her &s;en&s;es, whil&s;t he, with
<PB N="131" REF="145">the greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind, recollected where he had &s;een two large tubs of water, which the maids had prepared the night before for their wa&s;hing, and, &s;eizing the wet linen which had been left to &s;oak, threw them upon the flames. He exerted him&s;elf with &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, that the fire was pre&s;ently extingui&s;hed. Every thing was now once more &s;afe and quiet. Mrs. Pomfret, recovering from her fright, po&s;tponed all enquiries till the morning, and rejoiced that her mi&s;tre&s;s had not been wakened, whil&s;t Cork&s;crew flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould be able to conceal the true cau&s;e of the accident. "Don't you tell Mrs. Pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room," &s;aid he to Franklin. "If &s;he a&s;ks me, you know I mu&s;t tell the truth," replied he. "Mu&s;t!" repeated Felix &s;neeringly; "what you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a tell-tale!"&mdash;"No, I never told any tales of any body, and I &s;hould be very &s;orry to get any one into a &s;crape; but for all that I &s;hall not tell a lie, either for my&s;elf or any body el&s;e, let you call me what names you will."&mdash;"But if I were to give you &s;omething that you would like," &s;aid Cork&s;crew;&mdash; "&s;omething that I know you would like!"
<PB N="132" REF="146">repeated Felix. "Nothing you can give me will do," an&s;wered Franklin &s;teadily; "&s;o it is u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay any more about it&mdash;I hope I &s;hall not be que&s;tioned." In this hope he was mi&s;|taken; for the fir&s;t thing Mrs. Pomfret did in the morning was to come into the butler's room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains, whil&s;t Cork&s;crew &s;tood by endeavouring to ex|culpate him&s;elf by all the excu&s;es he could in|vent. Mrs. Pomfret, however, thought &s;ome|times blinded by her prejudices, was no fool, and it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to make her be|lieve that a candle which had been left on the hearth, where Cork&s;crew prote&s;ted he had left it, could have &s;et curtains on fire which were at lea&s;t &s;ix foot di&s;tance. Turning &s;hort round to Franklin, &s;he de&s;ired that he would &s;hew her where he found the candle when he came into the room. He begged not to be que&s;tion|ed; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted. He took up the candle|&s;tick; but the moment the hou&s;ekeeper ca&s;t her eye upon it, &s;he &s;natched it from his hands &mdash;"How did this candle&s;tick come here? This was not the candle&s;tick you found here la&s;t night," cried &s;he. "Yes, indeed, it was," an&s;wered Franklin. "That is impo&s;&s;ible,"
<PB N="133" REF="147">retorted &s;he vehemently, "for I left this can|dle&s;tick with my own hands, la&s;t night, in the hall, the la&s;t thing I did after you," &s;aid &s;he, turning to the butler, "was gone to bed&mdash;I'm &s;ure of it&mdash;Nay, don't you recollect my taking this <HI>japanned candle&s;tick</HI> out of your hand, and making you go up to bed with the bra&s;s one, and I bolted the door at the &s;tair head after you?"</P>
<P>This was all very true; but Cork&s;crew had afterwards gone down from his room by a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k &s;tairca&s;e, unbolted that door, and, upon his re|turn from the alehou&s;e, had taken the japanned candle&s;tick by mi&s;take up &s;tairs, and had left the bra&s;s one in its &s;tead upon the hall table.</P>
<P>"Oh, ma'am," &s;aid Felix, "indeed you forget, for Mr. Cork&s;crew came into my room to de&s;ire me to call him betimes in the morn|ing, and I happened to take particular notice, and he had the japanned candle&s;tick in his hand, and that was ju&s;t as I heard you bolting the door&mdash;indeed, ma'am, you forget."&mdash;"In|deed, Sir," retorted Mrs. Pomfret, ri&s;ing in an|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, "I do not forget; I'm not come to be <HI>&s;upper-annuated</HI> yet, I hope&mdash;How do you dare to tell me I forget?"&mdash;"Oh, ma'am," cried
<PB N="134" REF="148">Felix, "I beg your pardon, I did not&mdash;I did not mean to &s;ay you forgot&mdash;but only I thought, perhaps, you might not particularly remember; for it you plea&s;e to recollect&mdash;" "I won't plea&s;e to recollect ju&s;t whatever you plea&s;e, Sir!&mdash;Hold your tongue&mdash;Why &s;hould you poke your&s;elf into this &s;crape&mdash;What have you to do with it, I &s;hould be glad to know?"&mdash; "Nothing in the world, oh nothing in the world; I'm &s;ure I beg your pardon, ma'am," an&s;wered Felix in a &s;oft tone, and, &s;neaking off, left his friend Cork&s;crew to fight his own bat|tle, &s;ecretly re&s;olving to de&s;ert in good time if he &s;aw any danger of the alehou&s;e tran&s;actions coming to light.</P>
<P>Cork&s;crew could make but very blundering excu&s;es for him&s;elf; and, con&s;cious of guilt, he turned pale, and appeared &s;o much more terri|fied than butlers u&s;ually appear when detected in a lie, that Mrs. Pomfret re&s;olved, as &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ift the matter to the bottom. Impatiently did &s;he wait till the clock &s;truck nine, and her mi&s;tre&s;s's bell rang, the &s;ignal for her attendance at her levee.&mdash;"How do you find your&s;elf this morning, ma'am," &s;aid &s;he, undrawing the cur|tains. "Very &s;leepy, indeed," an&s;wered her
<PB N="135" REF="149">mi&s;tre&s;s in a drow&s;y voice; "I think I mu&s;t &s;leep half an hour longer&mdash;&s;hut the curtains." &mdash;"As you plea&s;e, ma'am; but I &s;uppo&s;e I had better open a little of the window &s;hutter, for it's pa&s;t nine."&mdash;"But ju&s;t &s;truck."&mdash; "Oh dear, ma'am, it &s;truck before I came up &s;tairs, and you know we are twenty minutes &s;low &mdash; Lord ble&s;s us?" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, as &s;he let fall the bar of the window, which rou&s;ed her mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;"I'm &s;ure I beg pardon a thou&s;and times&mdash;it's only the bar&mdash;becau&s;e I had this great key in my hand."&mdash;Put down the key then, or you'll knock &s;omething el&s;e down; and you may open the &s;thutters now, for I'm quite awake."&mdash;"Dear me! I'm &s;o &s;orry to think of di&s;turbing you," cried Mrs. Pomfret, at the &s;ame time throwing the &s;hut|ters wide open: "but, to be &s;ure, ma'am, I have &s;omething to tell you, which won't let you &s;leep again in a hurry. I brought up this here key of the hou&s;e door for rea&s;ons of my own, which I'm &s;ure you'll approve of&mdash;but I'm not come to that part of my &s;tory yet&mdash;I hope you were not di&s;turbed by the noi&s;e in the hou&s;e la&s;t night, ma'am."&mdash;"I heard no noi&s;e."&mdash;"I am &s;urpri&s;ed at that though,"
<PB N="136" REF="150">continued Mrs. Pomfret, and now proceeded to give a mo&s;t ample account of the fire, of her fears, and her &s;u&s;picions.&mdash;"To be &s;ure, ma'am, what I &s;ay <HI>is,</HI> that, without the &s;pirit of prophecy, one can no ways account for what has pa&s;&s;ed. I'm quite clear in my own judg|ment that Mr. Cork&s;crew mu&s;t have been out la&s;t night after I went to bed; for, be&s;ides the japanned candle&s;tick, which of it&s;elf I'm &s;ure is &s;trong enough to hang a man, there's another circum&s;tance, ma'am, that certifies it to me &mdash; though I have not mentioned it, ma'am, to no one yet," lowering her voice&mdash;"Franklin, when I que&s;tioned him, told me, that he left the lantern in the out&s;ide porch in the court la&s;t night, and this morning it was on the kitchen table: now, ma'am, that lantern could not come without hands; and I could not for|get about that, you know; for Franklin &s;ays he's &s;ure he left the lantern out."&mdash;"And do you believe <HI>him?</HI>"&mdash;"To be &s;ure, ma'am &mdash; how can I help believing him? I never found him out in the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of a lie &s;ince ever he came into the hou&s;e; &s;o one can't help be|lieving in him, like him or not."&mdash;"Without meaning to tell a fal&s;ehood, however, he might
<PB N="137" REF="151">make a mi&s;take."&mdash;"No, ma'am, he never makes mi&s;takes; it is not his way to go go&s;&s;ip|ping and tattling; he never tells any thing till he's a&s;ked, and then it's fit he &s;hould. About the &s;irloin of beef, and all, he was right in the end I found, to do him ju&s;tice; and I'm &s;ure he's right now about the lantern&mdash;he's <HI>always right.</HI>" Mrs. Churchill could not help &s;miling. &mdash;"If you had &s;een him, ma'am, la&s;t night in the mid&s;t of the fire&mdash;I'm &s;ure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds &mdash;and I &s;hall never forget his coming to call me&mdash;Poor fellow! he that I was always &s;cold|ing and &s;colding, enough to make him hate me. But he's too good to hate any body; and I'll be bound I'll make it up to him now."&mdash; "Take care that you don't go from one ex|treme into another, Pomfret; don't &s;poil the boy."&mdash;No, ma'am, there's no danger of that; but I'm &s;ure if you had &s;een him la&s;t night your&s;elf, you would think he de&s;erved to be re|warded."&mdash;"And &s;o he &s;hall be rewarded," &s;aid Mrs. Churchill; "but I will try him more fully yet."&mdash;"There's no occa&s;ion, I think, for trying him any more, ma'am," &s;aid Mrs. Pomfret, who was as violent in her likings as
<PB N="138" REF="152">as in her di&s;likes. "Pray de&s;ire," continued her mi&s;tre&s;s, "that he will bring up breakfa&s;t this morning; and leave the key of the hou&s;e door, Pomfret, with me."</P>
<P>When Franklin brought the urn into the breakfa&s;t parlour, his mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;tanding by the fire with the key in her hand. She &s;poke to him of his la&s;t night's exertions in terms of much approbation. "How long have you lived with me?" &s;aid &s;he, pau&s;ing; "three weeks, I think?"&mdash;"Three weeks and four days, madam."&mdash;"That is but a &s;hort time; yet you have conducted your&s;elf &s;o as to make me think I may depend upon you. You know this key?"&mdash;"I believe, madam, it is the key of the hou&s;e door."&mdash;"It is: I &s;hall tru&s;t it in your care. It is a great tru&s;t for &s;o young a per&s;on as you are." Franklin &s;tood &s;ilent, with a firm but mode&s;t look. "If you take the charge of this key," continued his mi&s;tre&s;s, "remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands. In the day|time it mu&s;t not be left in the door. You mu&s;t not tell any body where you keep it at night; and the hou&s;e door mu&s;t not be unlocked after eleven o'clock at night, unle&s;s by my orders.
<PB N="139" REF="153">Will you take charge of the key upon the&s;e conditions?"&mdash;"I will, madam, do any thing you order me," &s;aid Franklin, and received the key from her hands.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Churchill's orders were made known, they cau&s;ed many &s;ecret marvellings and murmurings. Cork&s;crew and Felix were di&s;concerted, and dared not openly avow their di&s;content; and they treated Frank|lin with the greate&s;t &s;eeming kindne&s;s and cordiality. Every thing went on &s;moothly for three days; the butler never attempted his u&s;ual midnight vi&s;its to the alehou&s;e, but went to bed in proper time, and paid particular court to Mrs. Pomfret, in order to di&s;pel her &s;u&s;picions. She had never had any idea of the real fact, that he and Felix were joined in a plot with hou&s;e-breakers to rob the hou&s;e, but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge him&s;elf in his pa&s;&s;ion for drinking.&mdash;So &s;tood affairs the night before Mrs. Churchill's birth|day. Cork&s;crew, by the hou&s;ekeeper's means, ventured to pre&s;ent a petition that hemight go to the play the next day, and his reque&s;t was granted. Franklin came into the kitchen ju&s;t when all the &s;ervants had gathered round the
<PB N="140" REF="154">butler, who, with great importance was read|ing aloud the play-bill. Every body pre&s;ent &s;oon began to &s;peak at once, and with great en|thu&s;ia&s;m talked of the playhou&s;e, the actors and actre&s;&s;es; and then Felix, in the fir&s;t pau&s;e, turned to Franklin, and &s;aid, "Lord, you know nothing of all this! <HI>you</HI> never went to a play, did you?"&mdash;"Never," &s;aid Franklin, and felt, he did not know why, a little a&s;hamed; and he longed extremely to go to one. "How &s;hould you like to go to the play with me to|morrow," &s;aid Cork&s;crew. "Oh," exclaimed Franklin, "I &s;hould like it exceedingly."&mdash; "And do you think mi&s;tre&s;s would let you if I a&s;ked."&mdash;"I think&mdash;may be &s;he would, if Mrs. Pemfret a&s;ked her."&mdash;"But then you have no money, have you?"&mdash;"No," &s;aid Franklin, &s;ighing. "But &s;tay, &s;aid Cork&s;crew, "what I am thinking of is, that if mi&s;tre&s;s will let you go, I'll treat you my&s;elf, rather than that you &s;hould be di&s;appointed."</P>
<P>Delight, &s;urpri&s;e, and gratitude, appeared in Franklin's face at the&s;e words. Cork&s;crew re|j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ced to &s;ee that now, at lea&s;t, he had found a mo&s;t powerful temptation. "Well, then, I'll go ju&s;t now and a&s;k her: in the mean time
<PB N="141" REF="155">lend me the key of the hou&s;e door for a minute or two."&mdash;"The key!" an&s;wered Franklin &s;tarting; "I'm &s;orry, but I can't do that, for I've promi&s;ed my mi&s;tre&s;s never to let it out of my own hands."&mdash;"But how will &s;he know any thing of the matter?&mdash;Run, run and get it for us."&mdash;"No, I <HI>cannot,</HI>" replied Franklin, re|&s;i&s;ting the pu&s;h which the butler gave his &s;houl|der. "You can't?" cried Cork&s;crew, chang|ing his tone; "then, Sir, I can't take you to the play."&mdash;"Very well, Sir," &s;aid Franklin &s;orrowfully, but with &s;teadine&s;s. "Very well, Sir," &s;aid Felix, mimicking him, "you need not look &s;o important, nor fancy your&s;elf &s;uch a great man, becau&s;e you're ma&s;ter of a key." &mdash;"Say no more to him," interrupted Cork|&s;crew; let him alone to take his own way&mdash; Felix, you would have no objection, I &s;uppo&s;e, to going to the play with me?"&mdash;"Oh, I &s;hould like it of all things, if I did not come between any body el&s;e"&mdash;"But come, come!" added the hypocrite, a&s;&s;uming a tone of friendly per&s;ua&s;ion, "you won't be &s;uch a blockhead, Franklin, as to lo&s;e going to the play for no|thing; it's only ju&s;t ob&s;tinacy: what harm can it do to lend Mr. Cork&s;crew the key for five
<PB N="142" REF="156">minutes; he'll give it to you back again &s;afe and &s;ound. "I don't doubt <HI>that,</HI>" an&s;wered Franklin "Then it mu&s;t be all becau&s;e you don't wi&s;h to oblige Mr. Cork&s;crew."&mdash;"No; but I can't oblige him in this: for, as I told you before, my mi&s;tre&s;s tru&s;ted me; I promi&s;ed never to let the key out of my own hands; and you would not have me break my tru&s;t: Mr. Spencer told me <HI>that</HI> was wor&s;e than <HI>robbing.</HI>" At the word <HI>robbing</HI> both Cork&s;crew and Felix involuntarily ca&s;t down their eyes, and turned the conver&s;ation immediately, &s;ay|ing that he did very right; that they did not really want the key, and had only a&s;ked for it ju&s;t to try if he would keep his word. "Shake hands," &s;aid Cork&s;orew, "I am glad to find you out to be an hone&s;t fellow!"&mdash;"I'm &s;orry you did not think me one before, Mr. Cork|&s;crew:" &s;aid Franklin, giving his hand rather proudly; and he walked away.</P>
<P>"We &s;hall make no hand of this prig," &s;aid Cork&s;crew. "But we'll have the key from him in &s;pite of all his ob&s;tinacy," &s;aid Felix; "and let him make his &s;tory good as he can afterwards. He &s;hall repent of the&s;e airs. To-night I'll watch him, and find out
<PB N="143" REF="157">where he hides the key; and when he's a&s;leep we'll get it without thanking him."</P>
<P>This plan Felix put in execution. They di&s;covered the place where Franklin kept the key at night, &s;tole it whil&s;t he &s;lept, took off the impre&s;&s;ion in wax, and carefully replaced it in Franklin's trunk, exactly where they found it.</P>
<P>Probably our young readers cannot gue&s;s what u&s;e they could mean to make of this im|pre&s;&s;ion of the key in wax. Knowing how to do mi&s;chief is very different from wi&s;hing to do it; and the mo&s;t innocent per&s;ons are generally the lea&s;t ignorant. By means of the impre&s;|&s;ion, which they had thus obtained, Cork&s;crew and Felix propo&s;ed to get a fal&s;e key made by Picklock, a &s;mith who belonged to their gang of hou&s;ebreakers; and with this fal&s;e key they knew they could open the door whenever they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Little &s;u&s;pecting what had happened, Frank|lin the next morning went to unlock the hou&s;e|door as u&s;ual; but finding the key entangled in the lock, he took it out to examine it, and perceived a lump of wax &s;ticking in one of the wards. Struck with this circum&s;tance, it brought to his mind all that had pa&s;&s;ed the pre|ceding
<PB N="144" REF="158">evening, and, being &s;ure that he had no wax near the key, he began to &s;u&s;pect what had happened; and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix &s;ay, that "give him but a halfpenny worth of wax, and he could open the &s;tronge&s;t lock that ever was made by hands."</P>
<P>All the&s;e things con&s;idered, Franklin re&s;olv|ed to take the key ju&s;t as it was, with the wax &s;ticking in it, to his mi&s;tre&s;s. "I was not mi&s;|taken when I thought I might tru&s;t <HI>you</HI> with this key," &s;aid Mrs. Churchill, after &s;he had heard his &s;tory. "My brother will be here to day, and I &s;hall con&s;ult him; in the mean time &s;ay nothing of what has pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Evening came, and after tea Mr. Spencer &s;ent for Franklin up &s;tairs. "So, Mr. Frank|lin," &s;aid he, I'm glad to find you are in &s;uch high <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in this family. Franklin bowed. "But you have lo&s;t, I under&s;tand, the plea&s;ure of going to the play to-night."&mdash;"I don't think any thing&mdash;much, I mean&mdash;of that, Sir," an&s;wered Franklin &s;miling. "Are Cork&s;crew and Felix <HI>gone</HI> to the play."&mdash;"Yes; half an hour ago, Sir."&mdash;"Then I &s;hall look into his
<PB N="145" REF="159">room, and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care."</P>
<P>When Mr. Spencer came to examine the pantry, he found the large &s;alvers and cups in a ba&s;ket behind the door, and the other things placed &s;o as to be ea&s;ily carried off. Nothing at fir&s;t appeared in Cork&s;crew's bed-chamber to &s;treng then their &s;u&s;picions, till, ju&s;t as they were going to leave the room, Mrs. Pomfret exclaimed, "why, if there is not Mr. Cork|&s;crew's dre&s;s coat hanging up there! and if here isn't Felix's fine cravat that he wanted in &s;uch a hurry to go to the play!&mdash;Why, Sir, they can't be gone to the play&mdash;look at the cravat.&mdash; Ha! upon my word, I am afraid they are not at the play&mdash;No, Sir, no! you may be &s;ure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehou&s;e&mdash;and they'll certainly break in|to the hou&s;e to-night&mdash;we &s;hall all be murder|ed in our beds, as &s;ure as I'm a living woman, Sir&mdash;But if you'll only take my advice&mdash;" "Pray, good Mrs. Pomfret, don't be alarmed." &mdash;"Nay, Sir, but I won't pretend to &s;leep in the hou&s;e, if Franklin isn't to have a blunder|bu&s;s, and I a <HI>baggonet.</HI>"&mdash;"You &s;hall have both
<PB N="146" REF="160">indeed, Mrs Pomfret; but don't make &s;uch a noi&s;e, for every body will hear you."</P>
<P>The love of my&s;tery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs. Pomfret's love of talking. She was &s;ilent; and contented her&s;elf the re&s;t of the evening with making &s;igns, looking <HI>ominous</HI> and &s;talking about the hou&s;e like one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>E&s;caped from Mrs. Pomfret's fears and ad|vice, Mr. Spencer went to a &s;hop within a few doors of the alehou&s;e, which he heard Cork|&s;crew frequented, and &s;ent to beg to &s;peak to the landlord. He came; and, when Mr. Spencer que&s;tioned him, confe&s;&s;ed that Cork|&s;crew and Felix were actually drinking in his hou&s;e, with two men of &s;u&s;picious appearance. That, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the pa&s;&s;age, he heard them di&s;puting about a key; and that one of them &s;aid, "Since we've got the key, we'll go about it to-night." This was &s;ufficient infor|mation. Mr. Spencer, le&s;t the landlord &s;hould give them information of what was going for|wards, took him along with him to Bow-&s;treet.</P>
<P>A con&s;table and proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ent to Mrs. Churchill's. They &s;tationed them&s;elves in a back parlour, which opened on a pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="147" REF="161">leading to the butler's pantry, where the plate was kept. A little after midnight they heard the hall-door; Cork&s;crew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry, and there Mr. Spen|cer and the con&s;table immediately &s;ecured them, as they were carrying off their booty.</P>
<P>Mrs. Churchill and Pomfret had &s;pent the night at the hou&s;e of an acquaintance in the &s;ame &s;treet. "Well, ma'am," &s;aid Mrs. Pom|fret, who had heard all the news in the morn|ing, "the villains are all &s;afe, thank God; I was afraid to go to the window this morning, but it was my luck to &s;ee them all go by to gaol &mdash;they looked &s;o &s;hocking!&mdash;I am &s;ure I never &s;hall forget Felix's look to my dying day!&mdash; But poor Franklin! ma'am, that boy has the be&s;t heart in the world&mdash;I could not get him to give a &s;econd look at them as they pa&s;&s;ed&mdash; poor fellow! I thought he would have dropped; and he was &s;o mode&s;t, ma'am, when Mr. Spen|cer &s;poke to him, and told him he had done his duty."&mdash;"And did my brother tell him what re|ward I intend for him."&mdash;"No, ma'am, and I'm &s;ure Franklin thinks no more of <HI>reward</HI> than I do."&mdash;"I intend," continued Mrs. Churchill," to &s;ell &s;ome of my old u&s;ele&s;s plate, and to lay
<PB N="148" REF="162">it out in an annuity for Franklin's life."&mdash; "La, ma'am!" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret with unfeigned joy, "I'm &s;ure you are very good; and I'm very glad of it."&mdash;"And," continued Mrs. Churchill, "here are &s;ome tickets for the play, which I &s;hall beg you, Pomfret, to give him, and to take him with you."&mdash;"I am very much obliged to you, indeed, ma'am; and I'll go with him with all my heart, and choo&s;e &s;uch plays as won't do no prejudice to his morality. &mdash;And ma'am," &s;aid Mrs. Pomfret, "the night after the fire I left him my great bible, and my watch, in my will; for I never was more mi&s;|taken at the fir&s;t in any boy in my born days: but he has won me by his own <HI>de&s;erts,</HI> and I &s;hall from this time forth love all the <HI>Villain|tropic</HI> folks for his &s;ake."</P>

<HEAD>THE BARRING OUT; OR, PARTY SPIRIT.</HEAD>
<P>"THE mother of mi&s;chief," &s;ays an old pro|verb, "is no bigger than a midge's wing"</P>
<P>At Doctor Middleton's &s;chool in England, there was a great tall dunce of the name of Fi&s;her, who never could be taught how to look out a word in a dictionary. He u&s;ed to tor|ment every body with&mdash;"Do pray help me! I can't make out this one word."&mdash;The per|&s;on who u&s;ually helped him in his di&s;tre&s;s was a very clever good-natured boy, of the name of De Grey. De Grey had been many years under Dr. Middleton's care, and by his abili|ties and good conduct did him great credit. The doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him; but he was &s;o well beloved, or &s;o much e&s;teemed by his companions, that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite,
<PB N="150" REF="164">until the arrival of a new &s;cholar of the name of Archer.</P>
<P>Till Archer came, the ideas of <HI>favourites</HI> and <HI>parties,</HI> were almo&s;t unknown at Dr. Middle|ton's; but he brought all the&s;e ideas fre&s;h from a great public-&s;chool, at which he had been educated&mdash;at which he had acquired a &s;ufficient quantity of Greek and Latin, and a &s;uper|abundant quantity of party-&s;pirit. His aim, the moment that he came to a new &s;chool, was, to get to the head of it, or at lea&s;t to form the &s;trong|e&s;t party. His influence, for he was a boy of con&s;iderable abilities, was quickly felt, though he had a powerful rival, as he thought proper to call him, in De Grey; and, with <HI>him,</HI> a rival was always an enemy. De Grey, &s;o far from giving him any cau&s;e of hatred, treated him with a degree of cordiality, which would pro|bably have had an effect upon Archer's mind, if it had not been for the artifices of Fi&s;her.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, that a <HI>great dunce</HI> &s;hould be able to work upon a boy like Archer, who was called a great genius; but when ge|nius is joined to a violent temper, in&s;tead of being united to good &s;en&s;e, it is at the mercy even of dunces.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="165">
Fi&s;her was mortally offended one morning by De Grey's refu&s;ing to tran&s;late his whole le&s;&s;on for him. He went over to Archer, who, con|&s;idering him as a parti&s;an de&s;erting from the enemy, received him with open arms, and tran&s;lated his whole le&s;&s;on, without expre&s;&s;ing <HI>much</HI> contempt for his &s;tupidity. From this moment Fi&s;her forgot all De Grey's former kindne&s;s, and con&s;idered only how he could in his turn mortify the per&s;on, whom he felt to be &s;o much his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>De Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium, which was to be given in their cla&s;s. Fi&s;her betted on Archer's head, who had not &s;en&s;e enough to de&s;pi&s;e the bet of a blockhead. On the contrary, he &s;uffered him to excite the &s;pirit of rival&s;hip in its utmo&s;t fury by collecting the bets of all the &s;chool.&mdash; So, that this premium now became a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, and Archer, in&s;tead of taking the means to &s;ecure a judgment in his favour, was li&s;tening to the opinions of all his companions. It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions, but he &s;uffered him|&s;elf to con&s;ider it as an affair of chance. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;equence was, that he tru&s;ted to chance&mdash;
<PB N="152" REF="166">his parti&s;ans lo&s;t their wagers, and he the pre|mium &mdash;and his temper.</P>
<P>"Mr. Archer," &s;aid Dr. Middleton, after the grand affair was decided, "you have done all, that genius alone could do; but you, De Grey, have done all that genius, and indu&s;try united, could do."</P>
<P>"Well!" cried Archer with affected gaiety, as &s;oon as the Doctor had left the room&mdash; "Well, I'm content with <HI>my</HI> &s;entence&mdash;Ge|nius alone! for me&mdash;indu&s;try for tho&s;e who <HI>want</HI> it"&mdash;added he, with a &s;ignificant look at De Grey.</P>
<P>Fi&s;her applauded this as a very &s;pirited &s;peech, and by in&s;inuations, that Dr. Middleton "al|ways gave the premium to De Grey," and that "tho&s;e who had lo&s;t their bets might thank them&s;elves for it, for being &s;uch &s;impletons as to bet again&s;t the favourite," he rai&s;ed a murmur, highly flattering to Archer, among&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t credulous boys; whil&s;t others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr. Middle|ton's impartiality. The&s;e warmly congratu|lated De Grey. At this Archer grew more and more angry, and when Fi&s;her was proceed|ing to &s;peak non&s;en&s;e <HI>for</HI> him, pu&s;hed forward
<PB N="153" REF="167">into the circle to De Grey, crying&mdash;"I wi&s;h, Mr. Fi&s;her, you would let me fight my own battles!"</P>
<P>"And <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h," &s;aid young Town&s;end, who was fonder of diver&s;ions than of premiums, or battles, or of any thing el&s;e&mdash;"<HI>I</HI> wi&s;h, that we were not to have any battles; after having worked like hor&s;es, don't &s;et about to fight like dogs. Come," &s;aid he, tapping De Grey's &s;houlder, "let us &s;ee your new play-hou&s;e, do&mdash;It's a holiday, and let us make the mo&s;t of it&mdash;let us have the School for Scandal, do, and I'll play Charles for you, and you De Grey &s;hall be <HI>my little Premium.</HI>&mdash;Come, do open this new play-hou&s;e of yours to-night."</P>
<P>"Come then!" &s;aid De Grey, and he ran acro&s;s the play-ground to a wa&s;te building, at the farthe&s;t end of it, in which, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the whole community, and with the permi&s;&s;ion of doctor Middleton, he had with much pains and ingenuity erecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a theatre.</P>
<P>"The new theatre is going to be opened! Follow the Manager!&mdash;Follow the Manager!" &mdash;echoed a multitude of voices.</P>
<P><HI>"Follow the Manager!"</HI> echoed very di&s;|agreeably in Archer's ear; but as he could not
<PB N="154" REF="168">be <HI>left alone,</HI> he was al&s;o obliged to follow the Manager. The moment that the door was un|locked, the crowd ru&s;hed in; the delight and wonder expre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ight was great, and the applau&s;es and thanks which were be&s;towed upon the Manager were long and loud.</P>
<P>Archer at lea&s;t thought them long, for he was impatient till his voice could be heard. When at length the exclamations had &s;pent them&s;elves, he walked acro&s;s the &s;tage with a knowing air, and looking round contemptu|ou&s;ly&mdash;</P>
<P>"And is <HI>this</HI> your famous play-hou&s;e?" cried he. "I wi&s;h you had any of you &s;een the play-hou&s;e <HI>I</HI> have been u&s;ed to!"</P>
<P>The&s;e words made a great and vi&s;ible change in the feelings and opinions of the public. "Who would be a &s;ervant of the public? or who would toll for popular applau&s;e?"&mdash;A few words &s;poken in a deci&s;ive tone by a new voice operated as a charm, and the play-hou&s;e was in an in&s;tant metamorpho&s;ed in the eyes of the &s;pectators. All gratitude for the pa&s;t was for|gotten, and the expectation of &s;omething bet|ter ju&s;tified to the capricious multitude their
<PB N="155" REF="169">di&s;dain of what they had &s;o lately pronounced to be excellent.</P>
<P>Every one now began to cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ci&s;e. One ob|&s;erved, "that the green certain was full of holes, and would not draw up."&mdash;Another at|tacked the &s;cenes&mdash;"Scenes! they were not like real &s;cenes&mdash;Archer mu&s;t know be&s;t, be|cau&s;e he was u&s;ed to the&s;e things."&mdash;So every body crowded to hear &s;omething of the <HI>other</HI> playhou&s;e. They gathered round Archer to hear the de&s;cription of his playhou&s;e, and at every &s;entence in&s;ulting compari&s;ons were made. When he had done, his auditors looked round&mdash;dighed&mdash;and wi&s;hed that Archer had been their Manager. They turned from De Grey, as from a per&s;on who had done them an injury. Some of his friends&mdash;for he had friends, who were not &s;wayed by the popular opinion&mdash; felt indignation at this ingratitude, and were going to expre&s;s their feelings, but De Grey &s;topped them, and begged that he might &s;peak for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen," &s;aid he, coming forward, as &s;oon as he felt that he had &s;ufficient command of him&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="170">
"My friends, I &s;ee you are di&s;contented with me and my playhou&s;e. I have done my be&s;t to plea&s;e you: but if any body el&s;e can plea&s;e you better, I &s;hall be glad of it. I did not work &s;o hard for the glory of being your Manager. You have my free leave to tear down"&mdash;Here his voice faultered, but he hur|ried on&mdash;"You have my free leave to tear down all my work as fa&s;t as you plea&s;e&mdash;Ar|cher, &s;hake hands fir&s;t, however, to &s;hew that there's no malice in the ca&s;e."</P>
<P>Archer, who was touched by what his rival &s;aid, and &s;topping the hand of his new parti&s;an Fi&s;her, cried, "No, Fi&s;her! no!&mdash;no pulling down. We can alter it. There is a great deal of ingenuity in it con&s;idering."</P>
<P>In vain Archer would now have recalled the public to rea&s;on. The time for rea&s;on was pa&s;t, enthu&s;ia&s;m had taken hold of their minds. &mdash;"Down with it!&mdash;Down with it!" "Ar|cher for ever!" cried Fi&s;her, and tore down the curtain. The riot once begun, nothing could &s;top the little mob, till the whole theatre was demoli&s;hed. The love of power prevailed in the mind of Archer; he was &s;ecretly flat|tered by the zeal of his <HI>party,</HI> and he mi&s;took
<PB N="157" REF="171">their love of mi&s;chief for attachment to him&s;elf. De Grey looked on &s;uperior. "I &s;aid I could bear to &s;ee all this, and I can," &s;aid he&mdash;"now it is all over."&mdash;And now it was all over there was &s;ilence. The rioters &s;tood &s;till to take breath, and to look at what they had done. There was a blank &s;pace before them.</P>
<P>In this moment of &s;ilence there was heard &s;omething like a female voice.&mdash;"Hu&s;h!&mdash; What &s;trange voice is that?" &s;aid Archer. Fi&s;her caught fa&s;t hold of his arm&mdash;Every body looked round to &s;ee where the voice came from It was du&s;k&mdash;Two window-&s;hutters at the far|the&s;t end of the building were &s;een to move &s;lowly inwards. De Grey, and in the &s;ame in&s;tant Archer went forward; and as the &s;hut|ters opened, there appeared through the hole the dark face and &s;hrivelled hands of a very old gyp&s;ey. She did not &s;peak; but &s;he looked fir&s;t at one, and then at another. At length &s;he fixed her eyes upon De Grey&mdash;"Well, my good woman, what do you want with me?"</P>
<P>"Want!&mdash;nothing&mdash;with <HI>you,</HI>" &s;aid the old woman; "do you want nothing with <HI>me?</HI>"</P>
<P>"Nothing," &s;aid De Grey. Her eye im|mediately turned upon Archer&mdash;"<HI>You</HI> want
<PB N="158" REF="172">&s;omething with me," &s;aid &s;he with empha&s;is&mdash; "I!&mdash;What do I want!" replied Archer&mdash; "No," &s;aid &s;he, changing her tone, "you want nothing&mdash;nothing will you ever want, or I am much mi&s;taken in that <HI>face.</HI>"</P>
<P>In that <HI>watch-chain,</HI> &s;he &s;hould have &s;aid, for her quick eye had e&s;pied Archer's watch-chain. He was the only per&s;on in company who had a watch, and &s;he therefore judged him to be the riche&s;t.</P>
<P>"Had you ever your fortune told, Sir, in your life?"</P>
<P>"Not I!" &s;aid he, looking at De Grey, as if he was afraid of his ridicule if he li&s;tened to the gyp&s;ey.</P>
<P>"Not you!&mdash;no!&mdash;for you will make your own fortune, and the fortune of all that belong to you!"</P>
<P>"There's good news for my friends!" cried Archer&mdash;"And I'm one of them, remember that," cried Fi&s;her.&mdash;"And I"&mdash;"And I"&mdash; joined a number of voices.</P>
<P>"Good luck to them!" cried the gyp&s;ey, "good luck to them all!"</P>
<P>Then as &s;oon as they had acquired &s;ufficient confidence in her good-will, they pre&s;&s;ed up to
<PB N="159" REF="173">the window&mdash;"There," cried Town&s;end, as he chanced to &s;tumble over the carpenter's mitre-box, which &s;tood in the way&mdash;"There's a good omen for me. I've &s;tumbled on the mitre-box; I &s;hall certainly be a Bi&s;hop."</P>
<P>Happy he who had &s;ixpence, for he bid fair to be a Judge upon the Bench. And happier he who had a &s;hilling, for he was in the high road to be one day upon the wool&s;ack, Lord High Chancellor of England. No one had half a crown, or no one would &s;urely have kept it in his pocket upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, for he might have been an Archbi&s;hop, a King, or what he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fi&s;her, who like all weak people was ex|tremely credulous, had kept his po&s;t immove|able in the front row all the time, his mouth open, and his &s;tupid eyes fixed upon the gyp&s;ey, in whom he felt implicit faith.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who have lea&s;t confidence in their own powers, and who have lea&s;t expectation from the &s;ucce&s;s of their own exertions, are al|ways mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to tru&s;t in fortune-tellers and fortune. They hope to <HI>win,</HI> when they cannot <HI>earn;</HI> and as they can never be con|vinced by tho&s;e who &s;peak &s;en&s;e, it is no won|der
<PB N="160" REF="174">they are always per&s;uaded by tho&s;e who talk non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>"I have a que&s;tion to put," &s;aid Fi&s;her in a &s;olemn tone. "Put it then," &s;aid Archer, "what hinders you?" "But they will hear me," &s;aid he, looking &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly at De Grey. "<HI>I</HI> &s;hall not hear you," &s;aid De Grey, "I am going." Every body el&s;e drew back, and left him to whi&s;per his que&s;tion in the gyp&s;ey's ear.</P>
<P>"What is become of my Livy?"</P>
<P>"Your <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> Livy, do you mean?" &s;aid the gyp&s;ey.</P>
<P>"No, my <HI>Latin</HI> Livy."</P>
<P>The gyp&s;ey pau&s;ed for further information &mdash; <Q>It had a leaf torn out in the beginning, and <HI>I hate Dr. Middleton</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"Written in it," interrupted the gyp&s;ey &mdash;</P>
<P>"Right &mdash; the very book!" cried Fi&s;her with joy. "But how <HI>could</HI> you know it was Dr. Middleton's name? I thought I had &s;cratched it, &s;o that nobody could make it out."</P>
<P>"Nobody <HI>could</HI> make it out but <HI>me,</HI>" re|plied the gyp&s;ey. "But never think to deceive me," &s;aid &s;he, &s;haking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble."</P>
<P>"I don't deceive you indeed. I tell you the whole truth. I lo&s;t it a week ago."</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="175">
"True."</P>
<P>"And when &s;hall I find it?"</P>
<P>"Meet me here at this hour to-morrow evening, and I will an&s;wer you. &mdash; No more! &mdash; I mu&s;t be gone &mdash; Not a word more to|night."</P>
<P>She pulled the &s;hutters towards her, and left the youth in darkne&s;s. All his companions were gone. He had been &s;o deeply engaged in this conference, that he had not perceived their departure. He found all the world at &s;upper, but no entreaties could prevail upon him to di&s;clo&s;e his &s;ecret. Town&s;end rallied in vain. As for Archer, he was not di&s;po&s;ed to de&s;troy by ridicule the effect, which he &s;aw that the old woman's predictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his little parti&s;ans. He had privately &s;lipped two good &s;hillings into the gyp&s;ey's hand to &s;ecure her; for he was willing to pay any price, for <HI>any</HI> means of ac|quiring power.</P>
<P>The watch-chain had not deceived the gyp|&s;ey, for Archer was the riche&s;t per&s;on in the community. His friends had imprudently &s;up|plied him with more money than is u&s;ually tru&s;ted to boys of his age. Doctor Middleton
<PB N="162" REF="176">had refu&s;ed to give him a larger monthly allow|ance than the re&s;t of his companions; but he brought to &s;chool with him &s;ecretly the &s;um of five guineas. This appeared to his friends and to him&s;elf an inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Riches and talents would, he flattered him|&s;elf, &s;ecure to him that a&s;cendancy of which he was &s;o ambitious. "Am I your Manager, or not?" was now his que&s;tion. "I &s;corn to take advantage of a ha&s;ty moment, but &s;ince la&s;t night you have had time to con&s;ider. If you de&s;ire me to be your Manager, you &s;hall &s;ee what a theatre I will make for you. In this pur&s;e," &s;aid he, &s;hewing through the net|work a glimp&s;e of the &s;hining trea&s;ure &mdash; "in this pur&s;e is Aladdin's wonderful lamp &mdash; Am I your Manager? &mdash; Put it to the vote."</P>
<P>It was put to the vote. About ten of the mo&s;t rea&s;onable of the a&s;&s;embly declared their gratitude, and high approbation of their old friend De Grey; but the numbers were in fa|vour of the new friend. And as no metaphy|&s;ical di&s;tinctions relative to the idea of a ma|jority had ever entered their thoughts, the mo&s;t numerous party con&s;idered them&s;elves as now beyond di&s;pute in the right. They drew off on
<PB N="163" REF="177">one &s;ide in triumph, and their leader, who knew the con&s;equence of a name in party mat|ters, immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed his parti&s;ans by the gallant name of <HI>Archers,</HI> &s;tigmati&s;ing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Archers was a cla&s;s, not very remarkable for their mental qualifications; but who, by their bodily activity, and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life, render|ed them&s;elves of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, e&s;pe|cially to the rich and enterpri&s;ing. The judi|cious reader will apprehend that I allude to the per&s;ons called day-&s;cholars. Among&s;t the&s;e, Fi&s;her was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his knowledge of all the &s;treets and &s;hops in the adjacent town; and, though a dull &s;cholar, he had &s;uch reputation as a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, that whoever had commi&s;|&s;ions to execute at the confectioner's were &s;ure to apply to him. Some of the younge&s;t of his employers had, it is true, at times complained, that he made mi&s;takes of halfpence and pence in their accounts; but as the&s;e affairs could never be brought to a public trial, Fi&s;her's cha|racter and con&s;equence were undimini&s;hed, till the fatal day when his aunt Barbara forbad his
<PB N="164" REF="178">vi&s;its to the confectioner &mdash; or rather, till &s;he reque&s;ted the confectioner, who had his private rea&s;ons for obeying her, not <HI>to receive</HI> her ne|phew's vi&s;its, as he had made him&s;elf &s;ick at his hou&s;e, and Mrs. Barbara's fears for his health were ince&s;&s;ant.</P>
<P>Though his vi&s;its to the confectioner's were thus at an end, there were many other &s;hops open to him; and, with officious zeal, he offer|ed his &s;ervices to the new Manager, to purcha&s;e whatever might be wanting for the theatre.</P>
<P>Since his father's death, Fi&s;her had become a boarder at Dr. Middleton's; but his frequent vi&s;its to his aunt Barbara afforded him oppor|tunities of going into the town. The carpen|ter, De Grey's friend, was di&s;carded by Archer, for having &s;aid <HI>"lack-a-dai&s;y!"</HI> when he &s;aw that the old theatre was pulled down. A new carpenter and paper-hanger, recommended by Fi&s;her, were appointed to attend, with their tools, for orders at two o'clock. Archer, im|patient to &s;hew his ingenuity and his genero&s;ity, gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes, in a mo&s;t decided manner. &mdash; "The&s;e things," he ob&s;erved, "&s;hould be done with &s;ome &s;pirit."</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="179">
To which the carpenter readily a&s;&s;ented, and added, that "Gentlemen of &s;pirit never looked to the <HI>expence,</HI> but always to the <HI>effect.</HI>" Upon this pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciple Mr. Chip &s;et to work with all po&s;&s;ible alacrity. In a few hours time he pro|mi&s;ed to produce a grand effect. High expec|tations were formed &mdash; nothing was talked of but the new play-hou&s;e; and &s;o intent upon it was every head, that no le&s;&s;ons could be got. Ar|cher was obliged, in the mid&s;t of his various oc|cupations, to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people.</P>
<P>"Oh, ye Athenians!" he exclaimed, "how hard do I work to obtain your prai&s;e!"</P>
<P>Impatient to return to the theatre, the mo|ment the hours de&s;tined for in&s;truction, or, as they are termed by &s;chool-boys, &s;chool hours, were over, each pri&s;oner &s;tarted up with a &s;hout of joy.</P>
<P>"Stop one moment, gentlemen, if you plea&s;e," &s;aid Dr. Middleton, in an aweful voice. "Mr. Archer, return to your place. &mdash; Are you all here?" &mdash; The names of all the boys were called over, and when each had an&s;wered to his name, Dr. Middleton &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="180">
"Gentlemen, I am &s;orry to interrupt your amu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ements; but, till you have contrary orders from me, no one, on pain of my &s;erious di&s;plea|&s;ure, mu&s;t go into <HI>that</HI> building," (pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting)&mdash; "Mr. Archer, your carpenter is at the door, you will be &s;o good as to di&s;mi&s;s him.&mdash;I do not think proper to give my rea&s;ons for the&s;e orders; but you who <HI>know</HI> me," &s;aid the doctor, and his eye turned towards De Grey, "will not &s;u&s;pect me of caprice&mdash;I depend, gentle|men, upon your obedience."</P>
<P>To the dead &s;ilence, with which the&s;e orders were received, &s;ucceeded in a few minutes an univer&s;al groan&mdash;"So!" &s;aid Town&s;end, "all our diver&s;ion is over."&mdash;"So," whi&s;pered Fi&s;her in the Manager's ear, "This is &s;ome trick of the Greybeards, did you not ob&s;erve how he looked at De Grey?"&mdash;Fired by this idea, which had never entered his mind before, Archer &s;tarted from his reverie, and &s;triking his hand upon the table, &s;wore, that he would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe &mdash;No, nor by all of them put together. The A chefs were &s;urely a match for them&mdash;he would &s;tand by them, if they would &s;tand by
<PB N="167" REF="181">him," he declared with a loud voice, "again&s;t the whole world, and Dr. Middleton him&s;elf, with <HI>"little Premium"</HI> at his right hand."</P>
<P>Every body admired Archer's &s;pirit, but were a little appalled at the &s;ound of &s;tanding again&s;t Dr. Middleton.</P>
<P>"Why not?" re&s;umed the indignant Mana|ger, "Dr. Middleton, nor no doctor upon earth &s;hall treat me with inju&s;tice. This, you &s;ee, is a &s;troke at me and my party, and I won't bear it."</P>
<P>"Oh, you are mi&s;taken!" &s;aid De Grey, who was the only one who dared to oppo&s;e rea|&s;on to the angry orator&mdash;"It cannot be a &s;troke aimed at "you and your party," for he does not know that you <HI>have</HI> a party."</P>
<P>"I'll make him know it, and I'll make <HI>you</HI> know it too," &s;aid Archer; "before I came here you reigned alone, now your reign is over, Mr. De Grey. Remember my majority this morning, and your theatre la&s;t night."&mdash;"He has remembered it," &s;aid Fi&s;her, "you &s;ee, the moment he was not to be our Manager, we were to have no theatre&mdash;no playhou&s;e&mdash;no plays. We mu&s;t all &s;it down with our hands before us
<PB N="168" REF="182">&mdash;all for <HI>"good rea&s;ons"</HI> of Dr. Middleton's, which he does not vouch&s;afe to tell us."</P>
<P>"I won't be governed by any man's rea&s;ons that he won't tell me," cried Archer; "he can|not have good rea&s;ons, or why not tell them."</P>
<P>"Non&s;en&s;e! <HI>we &s;hall not &s;u&s;pect him of ca|price!</HI>"</P>
<P>"Why not?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e we who know him," &s;aid De Grey, "have never known him capricious."</P>
<P>"Perhaps not, <HI>I</HI> know nothing about him," &s;aid Archer.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid De Grey, "for that very rea&s;on <HI>I</HI> &s;peak, who do know him.&mdash;Don't be in a pa&s;&s;ion, Archer."</P>
<P>"I will be in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;I won't &s;ubmit to tyranny&mdash;I won't be made a fool of by a few &s;oft words.&mdash;You don't know me, De Grey&mdash; I'll go through with what I've begun&mdash;I am Manager, and I will be Manager, and you &s;hall &s;ee my theatre fini&s;hed in &s;pite of you, and <HI>my</HI> party triumphant."</P>
<P>"Party," repeated De Grey.&mdash;"I cannot imagine what is in the word "party" that &s;eems to drive you mad. We never heard of parties till you came among&s;t us."</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="183">
"No; before I came, I &s;ay, nobody dared oppo&s;e you, but <HI>I</HI> dare; and I tell you to your face,&mdash;take care of me&mdash;a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto."</P>
<P>"I am not your enemy!&mdash;I believe you are out of your &s;en&s;es, Archer!" &s;aid he laughing.</P>
<P>"Out of my &s;en&s;es!&mdash;No&mdash;you are my ene|my!&mdash;Are not you my rival?&mdash;Did not you win the premium?&mdash;Did not you want to be Manager?&mdash;An&s;wer me, are not you, in one word, a Greybeard?"</P>
<P>"You called me a Greybeard, but my name is De Grey," &s;aid he, &s;till laughing.</P>
<P>"Laugh on!" cried the other furiou&s;ly. Come <HI>Archers,</HI> &s;ollow me!&mdash;<HI>we</HI> &s;hall laugh by and by, I promi&s;e you."</P>
<P>At the door Archer was &s;topped by Mr. Chip&mdash;"Oh, Mr. Chip, I am ordered to di&s;|charge you."</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir; and here is a little bill&mdash;</P>
<P>"Bill! Mr. Chip&mdash;why, you have not been at work for two hours!"</P>
<P>"Not much over, Sir; but if you'll plea&s;e to look into it, you'll &s;ee it's for a few things you ordered. The &s;tuff is all laid out and de|livered. The paper, and the fe&s;toon-bordering
<PB N="170" REF="184">for the drawing-room &s;cene is cut out, and left yander, within."</P>
<P>"Yander, within!&mdash;I wi&s;h you had not been in &s;uch a confounded hurry&mdash;&s;ix-and-twenty &s;hillings!" cried he, "but I can't &s;tay to talk about it now. &mdash; I'll tell you, Mr. Chip," &s;aid Archer, lowering his voice, "what you mu&s;t do for me, my good fellow." &mdash; Then drawing Mr. Chip a&s;ide, he begged him to pull down &s;ome of the wood-work which had been put up, and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars, of which he gave him the dimen&s;ions, with orders to place them all, when ready, under a hay-&s;tack, which he pointed out. Mr. Chip &s;crupled and he&s;itated, and began to talk of <HI>"the doctor."</HI> Archer immediately began to talk of the bill, and throwing down a guinea and a half, the con&s;cientious carpenter pocketed the money di|rectly, and made his bow.</P>
<P>"Well, Ma&s;ter Archer," &s;aid he, "there's no refu&s;ing you nothing. &mdash; You have &s;uch a way of talking one out of it &mdash; you manage me ju&s;t like a child."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye!" &s;aid Archer, knowing that he had been cheated, and yet proud of managing a carpenter &mdash; "Aye, aye, I know the way to ma|nage
<PB N="171" REF="185">every body&mdash;let the things be ready in an hour's time&mdash;and hark'e! leave your tools by mi&s;take behind you, and a thou&s;and of twenty-penny nails. &mdash; A&s;k no que&s;tions, and keep your own coun&s;el, like a wi&s;e man&mdash;off with you, and take care of <HI>"the doctor."</HI></P>
<P>"Archers!

<P>"My friends, is there a Greyberad among&s;t us? If there is, let him walk off now &mdash; he has my free leave."</P>
<P>No one &s;tirred. &mdash; "Then we are all Archers, and we will &s;tand by one another&mdash;join hands my friends."</P>
<P>They all joined hands.</P>
<P>"Promi&s;e me not to betray me, and I will go on &mdash; I a&s;k no &s;ecurity but your honour."</P>
<P>They all gave their honour to be &s;ecret and <HI>faithful,</HI> as he called it, and he went on &mdash;</P>
<P>"Did you ever hear of &s;uch a thing as <HI>a Bar|ring out,</HI> my friends?"</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="186">
They had heard of &s;uch a thing; but they had only heard of it.</P>
<P>Archer gave the hi&s;tory of a Barring out, in which he had been concerned at his &s;chool; in which the boys &s;tood out two days again&s;t the ma&s;ter, and gained their point at la&s;t, which was a week's more holidays at Ea&s;ter.</P>
<P>"But if <HI>we</HI> &s;hould not &s;ucceed," &s;aid they, "Dr. Middleton is &s;o &s;teady, he never goes back from what he has &s;aid."</P>
<P>"Did you ever try to pu&s;h him back? &mdash; Let us be &s;teady, and he'll tremble &mdash; tyrants always tremble when &mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh!" interrupted a number of voices, "but he is not a tyrant, is he?"</P>
<P>"All &s;chool-ma&s;ters are tyrants, are not they?" replied Archer, "and is not he a &s;chool-ma&s;ter?"</P>
<P>To this logic there was no an&s;wer; but, &s;till reluctant, they a&s;ked "What they &s;hould <HI>get</HI> by a Barring out?"</P>
<P>"Get! &mdash; Every thing! &mdash; What we want! &mdash; which is every thing to lads of &s;pirit &mdash; victory and liberty! &mdash; Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law &mdash; till he lets us in to our own

<P>"But perhaps he has rea&s;ons for not telling us."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!". cried Archer, "that's the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig, who &s;ays he has good rea&s;ons, and can't tell them.&mdash;Are you fools? &mdash; Go&mdash;go back to De Grey&mdash;I &s;ee you are all Greybeards &mdash; Go &mdash;who goes fir&s;t?"</P>
<P>Nobody would go <HI>fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"I will have nothing to do with ye, if ye are re&s;olved to be &s;laves!"</P>
<P>"We won't be &s;laves!" they all exclaimed at once.</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Archer, "&s;tand out in the right and be free."</P>
<P><HI>"The right."</HI> &mdash; It would have taken up too much time to examine what "the right" was.

<P>"To be &s;ure, Archer is a very clever boy, and he can't be mi&s;taken;"&mdash;or, "To be &s;ure Town&s;end thinks &s;o, and he would not do any thing to get us into a &s;crape:"&mdash;or, "To be &s;ure every body will agree to this but my&s;elf, and I can't &s;tand out alone, to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a &s;lave. Every body thinks it is right, and every body can't be wrong."</P>
<P>By &s;ome of the&s;e arguments, which pa&s;&s;ed rapidly through the mind, without his being con&s;cious of them, each boy decided, and de|ceived him&s;elf&mdash;what none would have done alone, none &s;crupled to do as a party.</P>
<P>It was determined then, that there &s;hould be a Barring out. The arrangement of the affair was left to their new Manager, to whom they all pledged implicit obedience.</P>
<P>Obedience, it &s;eems, is nece&s;&s;ary, even from rebels to their ringleaders&mdash;not rea&s;onable, but implicit obedience.</P>
<P>Scarcely had the a&s;&s;embly adjourned to the Ball-alley, when Fi&s;her, with an important length of face, came up to the Manager, and de|&s;ired to &s;peak one word to him&mdash;</P>
<P>"My advice to you, Archer, is, to do no|thing in this till we have con&s;ulted <HI>you know who</HI> about whether it's right or wrong."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="191">
<HI>"You know who!</HI>&mdash;Who do you mean? &mdash;Make ha&s;te, and don't make &s;o many faces, for I'm in a hurry.&mdash;Who is <HI>"You know who?"</HI></P>
<P>"The old woman," &s;aid Fi&s;her gravely; "the Gyp&s;ey."</P>
<P>"You may con&s;ult the old woman," &s;aid Archer, bur&s;ting out a laughing, "about what's right and wrong, if you plea&s;e; but no old wo|man &s;hall decide for me."</P>
<P>"No; but you don't <HI>take</HI> me," &s;aid Fi&s;her, "You don't <HI>take</HI> me. By right and wrong, I mean lucky and unlucky."</P>
<P>"Whatever <HI>I</HI> do will be lucky," replied Archer. "My Gyp&s;ey told you that already."</P>
<P>"I know, I know," &s;aid Fi&s;her, "and what &s;he &s;aid about your friends being lucky&mdash;that went a great way with many," added he, with a &s;agacious nod of his head, "I can tell you <HI>that</HI>&mdash;more than you think.&mdash;Do you know," &s;aid he, laying hold of Archer's button, "I'm in the &s;ecret. There are nine of us have crook|ed our little fingers upon it, not to &s;tir a &s;tep till we get her advice; and &s;he has appointed me to meet her about particular bu&s;ine&s;s of my
<PB N="176" REF="192">own at eight. So I'm to con&s;ult her and to bring her an&s;wer."</P>
<P>Archer knew too well how to govern fools to attempt to rea&s;on with them; and, in&s;tead of laughing any longer at Fi&s;her's ridiculous &s;u|per&s;tition, he was determined to take advantage of it. He affected to be per&s;uaded of the wi&s;|dom of the mea&s;ure&mdash;looked at his watch, urged him to be exact to a moment, conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle, and, above all things, to demand the lucky hour and minute when the Barring out &s;hould begin.</P>
<P>With the&s;e in&s;tructions, Archer put his watch into the &s;olemn dupe's hand, and left him to count the &s;econds, till the moment of his ap|pointment, whil&s;t he ran off him&s;elf to prepare the oracle. At a little gate which locked into a lane, through which he gue&s;&s;ed that the Gyp&s;ey mu&s;t pa&s;s, he &s;tationed him&s;elf, &s;aw her, gave her half a crown and her in&s;tructions, made his e&s;cape, and got back un&s;u&s;pected to Fi&s;her, whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him, watching the motion of the minute|hand.</P>
<P>Proud of his &s;ecret commi&s;&s;ion, Fi&s;her &s;louch|ed his hat, he knew not why, over his face, and
<PB N="177" REF="193">proceeded towards the appointed &s;pot. To keep, as he had been charged to do by Archer, within the letter of the law, he &s;tood <HI>behind</HI> the forbidden building and waited &s;ome minutes. Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance, muffled up and looking cautiou&s;ly about her.</P>
<P>"There's nobody near us!" &s;aid Fi&s;her, and he began to be a little afraid.&mdash;"What an&s;wer," &s;aid he, recollecting him&s;elf, "about my Livy?"</P>
<P>"Lo&s;t!&mdash;Lo&s;t!&mdash;Lo&s;t!" &s;aid the Gyp&s;ey, lifting up her hands, "never, never, never to be found!&mdash;But no matter for that now&mdash;that is not your errand to-night&mdash;no tricks with me &mdash;&s;peak to me of what is next your heart."</P>
<P>Fi&s;her, a&s;toni&s;hed, put his hand upon his heart, told her all that &s;he knew before, and re|ceived the an&s;wers, which Archer had dictated &mdash;"That the Archers &s;hould be lucky as long as they &s;tuck to their Manager and to one ano|ther; that the Barring out &s;hould end in woe, if not begun preci&s;ely as the clock &s;hould &s;trike nine on Wedne&s;day night; but if begun in that <HI>lucky</HI> moment, and all obedient to their <HI>lucky</HI> leader, all &s;hould end well."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="194">
A thought, a provident thought now &s;truck Fi&s;her; for even he had &s;ome fore&s;ight, where his favourite pa&s;&s;ion was concerned.&mdash;"Pray, in our Barring out, &s;hall we be &s;tarved?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid the Gyp&s;ey, "not if you tru&s;t to me for food, and if you give me money enough&mdash;&s;ilver won't do for &s;o many, gold is what mu&s;t cro&s;s my hand."</P>
<P>"I have no gold," &s;aid Fi&s;her, "and I don't know what you mean by "&s;o many,"&mdash;I'm only talking of number one, you know&mdash;I mu&s;t take care of that fir&s;t."</P>
<P>So, as Fi&s;her thought that it was po&s;&s;ible that Archer, clever as he was, might be di&s;ap|pointed in his &s;upplies, he determined to take &s;ecret mea&s;ures for him&s;elf. His aunt Barbara's interdiction had &s;hut him out of the confec|tioner's &s;hop, but he flattered him&s;elf that he could out-wit his aunt; he therefore begged the Gyp&s;ey to procure him twelve buns by Thur&s;day morning, and bring them &s;ecretly to one of the windows of the &s;chool-room.</P>
<P>As Fi&s;her did not produce any money when he made this propo&s;al, it was at fir&s;t ab&s;olutely rejected; but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties; and the bribe which Fi&s;her found
<PB N="179" REF="195">him&s;elf obliged to give&mdash;for he had no pocket money left of his own, he being as much <HI>re&s;trict|ed</HI> in that article as Archer was <HI>indulged</HI>&mdash;the bribe that he found him&s;elf obliged to give to quiet the Gyp&s;ey was half a crown, which Archer had entru&s;ted to him to buy candles for the theatre.&mdash;"Oh," thought he to him&s;elf, "Archer's &s;o carele&s;s about money, he will never think of a&s;king me for the half crown again; and now he'll want no candles for the <HI>theatre</HI>&mdash;or at any rate it will be &s;ome time fir&s;t; and may be aunt Barbara may be got to give me that much at Chri&s;tmas&mdash;then, if the wor&s;t comes to the wor&s;t, one can pay Archer. &mdash;My mouth waters for the buns, and have 'em I mu&s;t now."</P>
<P>So, for the hope of twelve buns, he &s;acrificed the money which had been entru&s;ted to him.&mdash; The meane&s;t motives, in mean minds, often prompt to the commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e great faults, to which, one &s;hould think, nothing but &s;ome violent pa&s;&s;ion could have tempted.</P>
<P>The amba&s;&s;ador having thus, in his opinion, concluded his own and the public bu&s;ine&s;s, re|turned well &s;atisfied with the re&s;ult, after re|ceiving the Gyp&s;ey's reiterated promi&s;e to tap
<PB N="180" REF="196"><HI>three times</HI> at the window on Thur&s;day morn|ing.</P>
<P>The day appointed for the Barring out at length arrived, and Archer, a&s;&s;embling the con|federates, informed them, that all was prepared for carrying their de&s;ign into execution; that he now depended for &s;ucce&s;s upon their punctu|ality and courage. He had, within the la&s;t two hours, got all the bars ready to fa&s;ten the doors and window &s;hutters of the &s;chool-room; he had, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two of the day-&s;cho|lars who were of the party, &s;ent into the town for provi&s;ions, at his own expence, which would make a hand&s;ome &s;upper for that night; he had al&s;o negociated with &s;ome cou&s;ins of his, who lived in the town, for a con&s;tant &s;upply in future.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me," exclaimed Archer, &s;uddenly &s;topping in this narration of his &s;ervices, "there's one thing, after all, I've forgot, we &s;hall be undone without it&mdash;Fi&s;her, pray did you ever buy the candles for the play-hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"No, to be &s;ure," replied Fi&s;her, extremely frightened, "you know you don't want candles for the play-hou&s;e now."</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="197">
"Not for the play-hou&s;e, but for the Barring-out&mdash;we &s;hall be in the dark, man&mdash;you mu&s;t run this minute, run."</P>
<P>"For candles?" &s;aid Fi&s;her confu&s;ed, "how many? &mdash; what &s;ort?"</P>
<P>"Stupidity!" exclaimed Archer, "you are a pretty fellow at a dead li&s;t!&mdash;Lend me a pen|cil and a bit of paper, do; I'll write down what I want my&s;elf!&mdash;Well, what are you fumbling for?"</P>
<P>"For money!" &s;aid Fi&s;her, colouring.</P>
<P>"Money, man! Didn't I give you half a crown the other day?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Fi&s;her, &s;tammering; "but I wasn't &s;ure that that might be enough."</P>
<P>"Enough! yes, to be &s;ure it will&mdash;I don't know what you are <HI>at.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Nothing, nothing," &s;aid Fi&s;her, "here, write upon this then," &s;aid Fi&s;her, putting a piece of paper into Archer's hand, upon which Archer wrote his orders.&mdash;"Away, away!" cried he.</P>
<P>And away went Fi&s;her.&mdash;He returned; but not until a con&s;iderable time afterwards.</P>
<P>They were at &s;upper when he returned&mdash; "Fi&s;her always comes in at &s;upper-time," ob|&s;erved one of the Greybeards, carele&s;sly.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="198">
"Well, and would you have him come in <HI>after</HI> &s;upper-time," &s;aid Town&s;end, who always &s;upplied his party with ready <HI>wit.</HI></P>
<P>"I've got the candles," whi&s;pered Fi&s;her, as he pa&s;&s;ed by Archer to his place&mdash;"And the tinder-box?" &s;aid Archer.</P>
<P>"Yes; I got back from my aunt Barbara under pretence, that I mu&s;t &s;tudy for repetition-day an hour later to-night&mdash;So I got leave. &mdash; Was not that clever?"</P>
<P>A dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by <HI>&s;ober lies.</HI></P>
<P>How Mr. Fi&s;her procured the candles and the tinder-box without money, and without credit, for he had no credit, we &s;hall di&s;cover in future.</P>
<P>Archer and his a&s;&s;ociates had agreed to &s;tay the la&s;t in the &s;chool-room, and as &s;oon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed, he as the &s;ignal was to &s;hut and lock one door, Town|&s;end the other; a third con&s;pirator was to &s;trike a light, in ca&s;e they &s;hould not be able to &s;ecure a candle; a fourth was to take charge of the candle as &s;oon as lighted; and all the re&s;t were to run to their bars, which were &s;ecreted in the room; then to fix them to the common fa&s;ten|ing
<PB N="183" REF="199">bars of the window, in the manner in which they had been previou&s;ly in&s;tructed by the Ma|nager. Thus each had his part a&s;&s;igned, and each was warned, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality.</P>
<P>Order and punctuality it appears are nece&s;|&s;ary even in a Barring out, and even rebellion mu&s;t have its laws.</P>
<P>The long expected moment at length ar|rived. De Grey and his friends, uncon&s;cious of what was going forward, walked out of the &s;chool-room as u&s;ual at bed time. The clock began to &s;trike nine. There was one Grey|beard left in the room, who was packing up &s;ome of his books, which had been left about by accident. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the impatience with which he was watched, e&s;pe|cially by Fi&s;her, and the nine who depended upon the Gyp&s;ey oracle.</P>
<P>When he bad got all his books together un|der his arm, he let one of them fall; and whil&s;t he &s;tooped to pick it up Archer gave the &s;ignal. The doors were &s;hut, locked, and double-locked in an in&s;tant. A light was &s;truck, and each ran to his po&s;t. The bars were all in the &s;ame moment put up to the windows, and Ar|cher,
<PB N="184" REF="200">when he had tried them all, and &s;een that they were &s;ecure, gave a loud "Huzza!"&mdash;in which he was joined by all the party mo&s;t man|fully&mdash;by all but the poor Greybeard, who, the picture of a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;tood &s;tock &s;till in the mid&s;t of them with his books under his arm; at which &s;pectacle Town&s;end, who enjoyed the <HI>&s;rolic</HI> of the fray more than any thing el&s;e, bur&s;t into an immoderate fit of laughter.&mdash;"So, my little Greybeard," &s;aid he, holding a candle full in his eyes, "what think you of all this?&mdash; How came you among&s;t the wicked ones?"</P>
<P>"I don't know indeed," &s;aid the little boy very gravely, "you &s;hut me up among&s;t you&mdash; won't you let me out?"</P>
<P>"Let you out! No, no, my little Grey|beard," &s;aid Archer, catching hold of him, and dragging him to the window bars&mdash;"Look ye here&mdash;Touch the&s;e &mdash; Put your hand to them &mdash; pull, pu&s;h, kick &mdash; Put a little &s;pirit into it, man &mdash; Kick like an Archer, if ye can &mdash; away with ye. It's a pity that the King of the Greybeards is not here to admire me &mdash; I &s;hould like to &s;hew him our fortifications. But come, my merry-men all, now to the fea&s;t. &mdash; Out with
<PB N="185" REF="201">the table into the middle of the room &mdash; Good cheer, my jolly Archers! &mdash; I'm your Manager?"</P>
<P>Town&s;end, delighted with the bu&s;tle, rubbed his hands, and capered about the room, whil&s;t the preparations for the fea&s;t were hurried for|ward.</P>
<P>"Four candles! &mdash; Four candles on the ta|ble. Let's have things in &s;tyle when we are about it, Mr. Manager," cried Town&s;end. "Places! &mdash; Places! There's nothing like a fair &s;cramble, my boys &mdash; Let every one take care of him&s;elf &mdash; Halloo! Grey-beard, I've knocked Greybeard down here in the &s;cuffle &mdash; Get up again, my lad, and &s;ee a little of life."</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Pi&s;her, "he &s;han't <HI>&s;up</HI> with us."</P>
<P>"No, no," cried the Manager, "he &s;han't <HI>live</HI> with us; a Greybeard is not &s;it company for Archers."</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Town&s;end, "evil com|munication corrupts good manners."</P>
<P>So with one unanimous hi&s;s they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner; and having pent him up with benches, Fi&s;her opened his books for him, which he thought the greate&s;t mortification, and &s;et up a candle be&s;ide him &mdash;
<PB N="186" REF="202">"There, now he looks like a Greybeard as he is!" cried they.</P>
<P>"Tell me what's the Latin for cold roa&s;t beef?" &s;aid Fi&s;her, exulting, and they returned to their fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Long and loud they revelled. They had a few bottles of cyder. "Give me the cork|&s;crew, the cyder &s;han't be kept till it's &s;our," cried Town&s;end, in an&s;wer to the Manager, who, when he beheld the provi&s;ions vani&s;hing with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity, began to fear for the morrow.</P>
<P>"Hang to-morrow!" cried Town&s;end, "let Greybeards think of to-morrow; Mr. Manager, here's your good health."</P>
<P>The Archers all &s;tood up as their cup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were filled to drink the health of their chief with an univer&s;al cheer.</P>
<P>But at the moment that the cups were at their lips, and as Archer bowed to thank the company, a &s;udden &s;hower from above a&s;to|ni&s;hed the whole a&s;&s;embly. They looked up and beheld the ro&s;e of a watering engine, who&s;e long neck appeared through a trap-door in the ceiling.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="203">
"Your good health, Mr. Manager!" &s;aid a voice, which was known to be the gardener's, and in the mid&s;t of their &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;may the candles were &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed &mdash; the trap|door &s;hut down, and they were left in utter darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Devil!</HI>" &s;aid Archer &mdash;</P>
<P>"Don't &s;wear, Mr. Manager," &s;aid the &s;ame voice from the ceiling, "I hear every word you &s;ay."</P>
<P>"Mercy upon us!" exclaimed Fi&s;her. "The clock," added he, whi&s;pering, "mu&s;t have been wrong, for it had not done &s;triking when we began. &mdash; Only you remember, Ar|cher; it had ju&s;t done before you had done locking your door."</P>
<P>"Hold your tongue, blockhead!" &s;aid Ar|cher. &mdash;"Well, boys! were ye never in the dark before? You are not afraid of a &s;hower of rain, I hope &mdash; Is any body drowned?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid they with a faint laugh, "but what &s;hall we do here in the dark all night long, and all day to-morrow? &mdash; we can't unbar the &s;hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ters." "It's a wonder <HI>nobody</HI> ever thought of that trap-door!" &s;aid Town&s;end.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="204">
The trap-door had indeed e&s;caped the Ma|nager's ob&s;ervation; as the hou&s;e was new to him, and the ceiling being newly white-wa&s;hed, the opening was &s;carcely perceptible. Vexed to be out-generalled, and &s;till more vexed to have it remarked, Archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations, and reproaches again&s;t tho&s;e, who were thus &s;o &s;oon di&s;couraged by a trifle: and groping for the tinder box, he a&s;ked if any thing could be ea&s;ier than to &s;trike a light again.</P>
<P>The light appeared. But at the moment that it made the tinder-box vi&s;ible, another &s;hower from above aimed, and aimed exactly at the tinder-box, drenched it with water, and rendered it totally unfit for further &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Archer in a fury da&s;hed it to the ground. And now for the fir&s;t time he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lt what it was to be the un&s;ucce&s;sful head of a party. He heard in his turn the murmurs of the di&s;con|tented, changeable populace; and recollecting all his bars and bolts, and ingenious contri|vances, he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only over&s;ight, than he was grieved at the di&s;a&s;ter it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="205">
"Oh, my hair is all wet!" cried one dole|fully.</P>
<P>"Wring it then," &s;aid Archer.</P>
<P>"My hand's cut with your broken gla&s;s," cried another.</P>
<P>"Gla&s;s!" cried a third, "mercy! is there broken gla&s;s? and it's all about, I &s;uppo&s;e, among&s;t the &s;upper &mdash; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d but one bit of bread all the time.</P>

<P>"It's all wet &mdash; And I don't like dry bread by it&s;elf &mdash; That's no fea&s;t."</P>
<P>"Heigh-day!&mdash;What, nothing but moan|ing and grumbling! &mdash; If the&s;e are the joys of <HI>a Barring out,</HI>" cried Town&s;end, "I'd rather be &s;nug in my bed. I expected that we &s;hould have &s;at up till twelve o'clock, talking and laughing and &s;inging."</P>
<P>"So you may &s;till, what hinders you?" &s;aid Archer&mdash; "Sing and we'll join you, and I &s;hould be glad tho&s;e fellows over-head heard us &s;ing|ing. Begin, Town&s;end&mdash;

<P>Nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment. In vain they roared in chorus. In vain they tried to appear gay &mdash; It would not do. The voices died away, and dropped off one by one. They had each provided him&s;elf with a great coat to &s;leep upon, but now in the dark there was a peevi&s;h &s;crambling conte&s;t for the coats, and half the company, in very bad hu|mour, &s;tretched them&s;elves upon the benches for the night.</P>
<P>There is great plea&s;ure in bearing any thing that has the appearance of hard&s;hip, as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it; but when people feel them&s;elves foiled, there is no further plea&s;ure in endurance: and if in their misfortune there is any mixture of the ridicu|lous, the motives for heroi&s;m are immediately de&s;troyed. Dr. Middleton had probably con|&s;idered this in the choice he made of his fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P>Archer, who had &s;pent the night as a man, who had the cares of government upon his &s;houlders, ro&s;e early in the morning, whil&s;t
<PB N="191" REF="207">every body el&s;e was fa&s;t a&s;leep. In the night he had revolved the affair of the trap-door, and a new danger had alarmed him. It was po&s;&s;i|ble that the enemy might de&s;cend&punc; upon them through the trap-door. The room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air. It was twenty feet high; to that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap-door. As &s;oon as the day-light appeared Archer ro&s;e &s;oftly, that he might <HI>reconnoitre,</HI> and devi&s;e &s;ome method of guarding again&s;t this new danger. Luckily there were round holes in the top of the win|dow &s;hutters, which admitted &s;ufficient light for him to work by. The remains of the &s;oaked fea&s;t, wet candles, and broken gla&s;s &s;pread over the table in the middle of the room, looked rather di&s;mal this morning.</P>
<P>"A pretty &s;et of fellows I have to manage!" &s;aid Archer, contemplating the groupe of &s;leep|ers before him. &mdash; "It is well they have &s;ome|body to think for them. Now if I wanted &mdash; which, thank goodne&s;s, I don't &mdash; but if I did want to call a call cabinet-council to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, who could I pitch upon? &mdash; Not this &s;tu|pid &s;norer, who is dreaming of Gyp&s;eys, if he
<PB N="192" REF="208">is dreaming of any thing," continued Archer, as he looked into Fi&s;her's open mouth.</P>
<P>"This next chap is quick enough; but then he is &s;o fond of having every thing his own way.</P>
<P>"And this curl-pated monkey, who is grin|ning in his &s;leep, is all tongue, and no brains.</P>
<P>"Here are brains, though nobody would think it, in this lump," &s;aid he, looking at a fat, rolled up, heavy-breathing &s;leeper; "but what &s;ignify brains to &s;uch a lazy dog; I might kick him for my foot-ball this half-hour before I &s;hould get him awake.</P>
<P>"This lank-jawed Harlequin be&s;ide him is a handy fellow, to be &s;ure; but then if he has hands he has no head&mdash;and he'd be afraid of his own &s;hadow too, by this light, he is &s;uch a coward!</P>
<P>"And Town&s;end, why he has puns in plenty; but when there's any work to be done, he's the wor&s;t fellow to be near one in the world&mdash; he can do nothing but laught at his own puns.</P>
<P>"This poor little fellow, that we hunted into the corner, has more &s;en&s;e than all of them put together; but then he is a Greybeard."</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="209">
Thus &s;peculated the chief of a party upon his &s;leeping friends.&mdash;And how did it happen, that he &s;hould be &s;o ambitious to plea&s;e and govern this &s;et, when, for each individual of which it was compo&s;ed, he felt &s;uch &s;upreme contempt? &mdash;He had formed them into a <HI>party,</HI> had given them a name, and he was at their head.&mdash;If the&s;e be not good rea&s;ons, none better can be a&s;&s;igned for Archer's conduct.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h ye could all &s;leep on," &s;aid he, "but I mu&s;t waken ye, though you will be only in my way. The &s;ound of my hammering mu&s;t waken them&mdash;&s;o I may as well do the thing hand&s;omely, and flatter &s;ome of them by pre|tending to a&s;k their advice."</P>
<P>Accordingly he pulled two or three to waken them.&mdash;"Come, Town&s;end, waken, my boy! &mdash;Here's &s;ome diver&s;ion for you&mdash;up! up!"</P>
<P>"Diver&s;ion!" cried Town&s;end, "I'm your man!&mdash;I'm up&mdash;<HI>up to any thing.</HI>"</P>
<P>So, under the name of <HI>diver&s;ion,</HI> Archer &s;et Town&s;end to work at four o'clock in the morn|ing. They had nails, a few tools, and &s;everal &s;pars, &s;till left from the wreck of the play-hou&s;e. The&s;e, by Archer's directions, they &s;harpened at one end, and nailed them to the ends of &s;e|veral
<PB N="194" REF="210">forms. All hands were now called to clear away the &s;upper things, and to erect the&s;e forms perpendicularly under the trap-door; and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few braces a che|vaux-de-fri&s;e was formed, upon which nobody could venture to de&s;cend. At the farthe&s;t end of the room they likewi&s;e formed a penthou&s;e of the tables, under which they propo&s;ed to breakfa&s;t, &s;ecure from the pelting &s;torm, if it &s;hould again a&s;&s;ail them through the trap-door. They crouded under the penthou&s;e as &s;oon as it was ready, and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job.</P>
<P>"Lord! I &s;hall like to &s;ee the gardener's phiz through the trap-door, when he beholds the &s;pikes under him!" cried Town&s;end.&mdash; "Now for breakfa&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Aye, now for breakfa&s;t," &s;aid Archer, look|ing at his watch; "pa&s;t eight o'clock, and my town boys not come!&mdash;I don't under&s;tand this!"</P>
<P>Archer had expected a con&s;tant &s;upply of pro|vi&s;ions from two boys who lived in the town, who were cou&s;ins of his, and who had promi&s;ed to come every day, and put food in at a certain hole in the wall, in which a ventilator u&s;ually turned.
<PB N="195" REF="211">This ventilator Archer had taken down, and had contrived it &s;o, that it could be ea&s;ily re|moved and replaced at plea&s;ure; but, upon ex|amination, it was now perceived that the hole had been newly &s;topped up by an iron back, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate or re|move.</P>
<P>"It never came into my head that any body would ever have thought of the ventilator but my&s;elf!" exclaimed Archer, in great perplexity. &mdash;He li&s;tened and waited for his cou&s;ins, but no cou&s;ins came; and, at a late hour, the company were obliged to breakfa&s;t upon the &s;cattered fragments of the la&s;t night's fea&s;t. That fea&s;t had been &s;pread with &s;uch imprudent profu&s;ion, that little now remained to &s;atisfy the hungry gue&s;ts. Archer, who well knew the effect which the apprehen&s;ion of a &s;carcity would have upon his a&s;&s;ociates, did every thing that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated a&s;&s;ertions to per&s;uade them, that his cou&s;ins would certainly come at la&s;t, and that the &s;up|plies were only delayed.&mdash;The delay, however, was alarming.</P>
<P>Fi&s;her alone heard the Manager's calculations, and &s;aw the public fears unmoved. Secretly
<PB N="196" REF="212">rejoicing in his own wi&s;dom, he walked from window to window, &s;lily li&s;tening for the Gyp|&s;ey's &s;ignal.&mdash;"There it is!" cried he, with more joy &s;parkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before; "Come this way, Archer&mdash;but don't tell any body&mdash;hark! do ye hear tho&s;e three taps at the window!&mdash;This is the old woman with twelve buns for me!&mdash;I'll give you one whole one for your&s;elf, if you will unbar the window for me."</P>
<P>"Unbar the window!" interrupted Archer; "no, that I won't, for you or the Gyp&s;ey ei|ther; but I have head enough to get your buns without that. But &s;tay; there is &s;omething of more con&s;equence than your twelve buns&mdash;I mu&s;t think for ye all, I &s;ee, regularly."</P>
<P>So he &s;ummoned a council and propo&s;ed, that every one &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe, and tru&s;t the &s;ub&s;cription to the Gyp&s;ey, to purcha&s;e a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions. Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his &s;ub&s;cription; at which &s;ight all the company clapped their hands, and is popularity ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty. Now, having made a li&s;t of their wants, they folded the money in the paper, put it into a bag, which
<PB N="197" REF="213">Archer tied to a long &s;tring, and, having broken the pane of gla&s;s behind the round hole in the window &s;hutter, he let down the bag to the Gyp&s;ey. She promi&s;ed to be punctual, and having filled the bag with Fi&s;her's twelve buns, they were drawn up in triumph, and every body anticipated the plea&s;ure with which they &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame bag drawn up at dinner-time. The buns were a little &s;queezed in being drawn through the hole in the window &s;hutter; but Archer immediately &s;awed out a piece of the &s;hutter, and broke the corre&s;ponding panes in each of the other windows, to prevent &s;u&s;picion, and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air.</P>
<P>What a pity that &s;o much ingenuity &s;hould have been employed to no purpo&s;e. It may have &s;urpri&s;ed the intelligent reader, that the Gyp&s;ey was &s;o punctual to her promi&s;e to Fi&s;her; but we mu&s;t recollect, that her appa|rent integrity was only cunning; &s;he was punc|tual that &s;he might be employed again&mdash;that &s;he might be entru&s;ted with the contribution which, &s;he fore&s;aw, mu&s;t be rai&s;ed among&s;t the fami&s;hing garri&s;on. No &s;ooner had &s;he receiv|ed the money than her end was gained.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="214">
Dinner-time came&mdash;it &s;truck three, four, five, &s;ix. They li&s;tened with hungry ears, but no &s;ignal was heard. The morning had been very long, and Archer had in vain tried to di&s;|&s;uade them from devouring the remainder of the provi&s;ions before they were &s;ure of a fre&s;h &s;upply. And now, tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t confident were the mo&s;t impatient of their di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Archer, in the divi&s;ion of the food, had at|tempted, by the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, to content the public, and he was both a&s;toni&s;hed and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached. So differently do people judge in different &s;ituations!&mdash;He was the fir&s;t per|&s;on to accu&s;e his ma&s;ter of inju&s;tice, and the lea&s;t capable of bearing &s;uch an imputation upon him&s;elf from others. He now experienced &s;ome of the joys of power, and the delight of managing unrea&s;onable numbers.</P>
<P>"Have not I done every thing I could to plea&s;e ye?&mdash;Have not I &s;pent my money to buy ye food?&mdash;Have not I divided the la&s;t mor&s;el with ye?&mdash;I have not ta&s;ted one mouthful to|day!&mdash;Did not I &s;et to work for ye at &s;un-ri&s;e? Did not I lie awake all night for ye?&mdash;Have not I had all the labour, all the anxiety?&mdash;
<PB N="199" REF="215">Look round and &s;ee <HI>my</HI> contrivances, <HI>my</HI> work, <HI>my</HI> genero&s;ity!&mdash;And after all, you think me a tyrant, becau&s;e I want you to have common &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Is not this bun which I hold in my hand my own?&mdash;Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that &s;elfi&s;h dunce (pointing to Fi&s;her) who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns, if I had not &s;hewn him how; eleven of them he has eaten &s;ince morning for his own &s;hare, without offering any mortal a mor&s;el; but I &s;corn to eat even what is ju&s;tly my own, when I &s;ee &s;o many hungry creatures longing for it. I was not going to touch this la&s;t mor&s;el my&s;elf; I only begged you to keep it till &s;upper time, when perhaps you'll want it more, and Town&s;end, who can't bear the &s;light|e&s;t thing that cro&s;&s;es his own whims, and who thinks there's nothing in this world to be minded but his own diver&s;ion, calls me a <HI>tyrant.</HI> &mdash;You all of you promi&s;ed to obey me&mdash;the fir&s;t thing I a&s;k you to do for your own good, and when, if you had common &s;en&s;e, you mu&s;t know I can want nothing but your good, you rebel again&s;t me.&mdash;Traitors!&mdash;Fools!&mdash;Ungrateful fools!"</P>
<P>Archer walked up and down unable to com|mand his emotion, whil&s;t, for the moment, the di&s;contented multitude was &s;ilenced.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="216">
"Here," &s;aid he, &s;triking his hand upon the little boy's &s;houlder, "Here's the only one among&s;t ye, who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint, and he has had but one bit of bread&mdash;a bit that I gave him my&s;elf this day.&mdash;Here" &s;aid he, &s;natching the bun, which nobody had dared to touch&mdash;"Take it&mdash;it's mine&mdash;I give it to you, though you are a Grey|beard &mdash; you de&s;erve it &mdash; eat it, and be an Archer.&mdash;You &s;hall be my captain&mdash;will you?" &s;aid he, li&s;ting him up in his arms above the re&s;t.</P>
<P>"I like you now," &s;aid the little boy cou|rageou&s;ly; "but I love De Grey better; he has always been my friend, and he advi&s;ed me never to call my&s;elf any of tho&s;e names, Archer or Grey beard, &s;o I won't&mdash;though I am &s;hut in here, I have nothing to do with it&mdash;I love Dr. Middleton; he was never unju&s;t to <HI>me;</HI> and, I dare &s;ay that he has very good rea&s;ons, as De Grey &s;aid, for forbidding us to go into that hou&s;e&mdash;be&s;ides, it's his own.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of admiring the good &s;en&s;e and &s;teadi|ne&s;s of this little lad, Archer &s;uffered Town&s;end to &s;natch the unta&s;ted bun out of his hands. He flung it at the hole in the window, but it
<PB N="201" REF="217">fell back. The Archers &s;crambled for it, and Fi&s;her eat it.</P>
<P>Archer &s;aw this, and was &s;en&s;ible that he had not done hand&s;omely in &s;uffering it. A few moments ago he had admired his own genero|&s;ity, and though he had felt the inju&s;tice of others, he had not accu&s;ed him&s;elf of any. He turned away from the little boy, and &s;itting down at one end of the table hid his face in his hands. He continued immoveable in this po&s;|ture for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>"Lord!" &s;aid Town&s;end, "it was an ex|cellent joke!"</P>
<P>"Pooh!" &s;aid Fi&s;her, "what a fool, to think &s;o much about a bun!"</P>
<P>"Never mind, Mr. Archer, if you are thinking about me," &s;aid the little boy, trying gently to pull his hands from his face.</P>
<P>Archer &s;tooped down, and lifted him up upon the table; at which &s;ight the enraged par|ti&s;ans &s;et up a general hi&s;s&mdash;"He has for&s;aken us!&mdash;He de&s;erts his party!&mdash;He wants to be a Greybeard!&mdash;After he has got us all into this &s;crape he will leave us!"</P>
<P>"I am not going to leave you," cried Ar|cher&mdash; "No one &s;hall ever accu&s;e me of de|&s;erting
<PB N="202" REF="218">my party. I'll &s;tick by the Archers, right or wrong, I tell you, to the la&s;t moment. But this little fellow&mdash;Take it as you plea&s;e, mutiny if you will, and throw me out of the window&mdash;Call me traitor! coward! Greybeard! &mdash;This little fellow is worth you all put to|gether, and I'll &s;tand by him again&s;t whoever da&s;es to lay a finger upon him&mdash;And the next mor&s;el of food that I &s;ee &s;hall be his&mdash;Touch him who dares!"</P>
<P>The commanding air with which Archer &s;poke and looked; and the belief, that the little boy de&s;erved his protection, &s;ilenced the crowd. But the &s;torm was only hu&s;hed.</P>
<P>No &s;ound of merriment was now to be heard, no battledore and &s;huttlecock&mdash;no ball&mdash;no marbles. Some &s;at in a corner, whi&s;pering their wi&s;hes that Archer would unbar the doors and give up. Others &s;tretching their arms, and gaping as they &s;auntered up and down the room, wi&s;hed for air, or food or water. Fi&s;her and his nine, who had &s;uch firm dependence upon the Gyp&s;ey, now gave them&s;elves up to utter de&s;pair. It was eight o'clock, growing darker and darker every minute, and no can|dles, no light could they have. The pro&s;pect
<PB N="203" REF="219">of another long dark night made them &s;till more di&s;contented. Town&s;end at the head of the yawners, and Fi&s;her at the head of the hungry malcontents, gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered &s;pirits, demanding "how long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon? and whether he expected, that they &s;hould &s;tarve them&s;elves to death for his &s;ake?"</P>
<P>The idea of <HI>giving up</HI> was more intolerable to Archer than all the re&s;t; he &s;aw, that the majority, his own convincing argument, was again&s;t him. He was therefore obliged to con|de&s;cend to the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion. He flattered &s;ome with hopes of food from the town-boys. Some he reminded of their promi&s;es. Others he prai&s;ed for former prowe&s;s; and others he &s;hamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was at length re&s;olved that at all events they <HI>would hold out.</HI> With this determination they &s;tretched them&s;elves again to &s;leep, for the &s;econd night, in weak and weary ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>Archer &s;lept longer and more &s;oundly than u&s;ual the next morning, and when he awoke&mdash; he found his hands tied behind him. Three or four boys had ju&s;t got hold of his feet, which
<PB N="204" REF="220">they pre&s;&s;ed down, whil&s;t the trembling hands of Fi&s;her were fa&s;tening the cord round them. With all the force which rage could in&s;pire, Archer &s;truggled and roared to <HI>"his Archers!"</HI> &mdash;his friends&mdash;his party!&mdash;for help again&s;t the traitors.</P>
<P>But all kept aloof. Town&s;end in particular &s;tood laughing, and looking on&mdash;"I beg your pardon, Archer, but really you look &s;o droll! &mdash;All alive and kicking!&mdash;Don't be angry&mdash; I'm &s;o weak, I cannot help laughing to day."</P>
<P>The packthread cracked&mdash;"His hands are free!&mdash;He's loo&s;e!" cried the lea&s;t of the boys, and ran away, whil&s;t Archer leaped up, and &s;eizing hold of Fi&s;her with a powerful gra&s;p, &s;ternly demanded "what he meant by this?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k my party"&mdash;&s;aid Fi&s;her terrified&mdash; "they &s;et me on&mdash;A&s;k my party."</P>
<P>"Your party!" cried Archer, with a look of ineffable contempt&mdash;"You reptile!&mdash;<HI>your</HI> party!&mdash;Can &s;uch a thing as <HI>you</HI> have a party?"</P>
<P>To be &s;ure," &s;aid Fi&s;her, &s;ettling his collar, which Archer in his &s;urpri&s;e had let go&mdash;"To be &s;ure&mdash;Why not?&mdash;Any man who chu&s;es it may have a party as well as your&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash; I have my nine Fi&s;hermen"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="221">
At the&s;e words, &s;poken with much &s;ullen importance, Archer, in &s;pite of his vexation, could not help laughing&mdash;"Fi&s;hermen!" cried he, <HI>"Fi&s;hermen!"</HI>&mdash; "And why not Fi&s;her|men as well as Archers!" cried they&mdash;"One party is ju&s;t as good as another; it is only a que&s;tion, which can get the upper hand&mdash;and we had your hands tied ju&s;t now."</P>
<P>"That's right, Town&s;end," &s;aid Archer, "laugh on, my boy!&mdash;Friend or foe, it's all the &s;ame to you. I know how to value your friend&s;hip now. You are a mighty good fel|low when the &s;un &s;hines; but let a &s;torm come, and how you &s;link away!"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant Archer felt the difference be|tween <HI>a good companion,</HI> and a good friend; a difference which &s;ome people do not di&s;cover till late in life.</P>
<P>"Have I no friend?&mdash;no real friend among&s;t ye all? And could ye &s;tand by and &s;ee my hands tied behind me like a thief's. What &s;ignifies &s;uch a party?&mdash;All mute?"</P>
<P>"We want &s;omething to eat," an&s;wered the Fi&s;hermen&mdash;"What &s;ignifies <HI>&s;uch</HI> a party in|deed? &mdash;and <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Manager, who can do no|thing for one?"</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="222">
"And have <HI>I</HI> done nothing?"</P>
<P>"Don't let's hear any more pro&s;ing," &s;aid Fi&s;her&mdash;"We are too many for you. I've ad|vi&s;ed my party, if they've a mind not to be &s;tarved, to give you up for the ringleader as you were; and Dr. Middleton will let <HI>us</HI> all off, I dare &s;ay."</P>
<P>So depending upon the &s;ullen &s;ilence of the a&s;&s;embly, he again approached Archer with a cord. A cry of "No!&mdash;no!&mdash;no! &mdash;Don't tie him" &mdash; was &s;eebly rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Archer &s;tood &s;till &mdash; But the moment Fi&s;her touched him he knocked him down to the ground, and turning to the re&s;t with eyes &s;park|ling with indignation &mdash; "Archers!" cried he.</P>
<P>A voice at this in&s;tant was heard at the door &mdash;It was De Grey's voice&mdash;"I have got a large ba&s;ket of provi&s;ions for your breakfa&s;t"</P>
<P>A general &s;hout of joy was &s;ent forth by the voracious public&mdash;"Breakfa&s;t! &mdash; Provi&s;ions!&mdash; a large ba&s;ket&mdash;De Grey lor ever! &mdash;Huzza!"</P>
<P>De Grey promi&s;ed upon his honour, that if they would unbar the door nobody &s;hould come in with him, and no advantage &s;hould be taken of them. This promi&s;e was enough even for Archer.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="223">
"I will let him in," &s;aid he, "my&s;elf, for I'm &s;ure he'll never break his word."</P>
<P>He pulled away the bar&mdash;the door opened &mdash; and having bargained for the liberty of Mel|&s;om, the little boy who had been &s;hut in by mi&s;take, De Grey pu&s;hed in his ba&s;ket of pro|vi&s;ions, and locked and barred the door in|&s;tantly.</P>
<P>Joy and gratitude &s;parkled in every face, when he unpacked his ba&s;ket, and &s;pread the table with a plentiful breakfa&s;t. A hundred que&s;tions were a&s;ked him at once&mdash;"Eat fir&s;t," &s;aid he, "and we will talk afterwards." This bu&s;ine&s;s was quickly di&s;patched by people, who had not ta&s;ted food for &s;everal hours. Their curio&s;ity encrea&s;ed as their hunger dimini&s;hed. &mdash;"Who &s;ent us breakfa&s;t?&mdash;Does Dr. Mid|dleton know?" &mdash; were que&s;tions reiterated from every mouth.</P>
<P>"He does know," an&s;wered De Grey, "and the fir&s;t thing I have to tell you is, that I am your fellow pri&s;oner. I am to &s;tay here till you give up. This was the only condition on which Dr. Middleton would allow me to bring you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood, and he will allow no more."</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="224">
Every one looked at the empty ba&s;ket. But Archer, in whom half-vanqui&s;hed party-&s;pirit revived with the &s;trength he had got from his breakfa&s;t, broke into exclamations in prai&s;e of De Grey's magnanimity, as he now imagined that De Grey was become one of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"And you will join us, will you? &mdash; that's a noble fellow!"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered De Grey calmly, "but I hope to per&s;uade, or rather to convince you that you ought to join me."</P>
<P>"You would have found it no hard ta&s;k to have per&s;uaded or convinced us, whichever you plea&s;ed," &s;aid Town&s;end, "if you had appealed to Archers fa&s;ting, but Archers fea&s;ting are quite other animals. Even Cae&s;ar him&s;elf after breakfa&s;t is quite another thing!" added he, pointing to Archer.</P>
<P>"You may &s;peak for your&s;elf, Mr. Town|&s;end," replied the in&s;ulted hero, "but not for me, or for Archers in general if you plea&s;e.

<P>This &s;pirited &s;peech was applauded by many, who had now forgotten the feelings of famine. Not &s;o Fi&s;her, who&s;e memory was upon this oc|ca&s;ion very di&s;tinct.</P>

<P>Many prud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt faces among&s;t the Fi&s;hermen &s;eemed to deliberate at the clo&s;e of this oration, in which the arguments were brought to "home to each man's bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;om."</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="226">
"But," &s;aid De Grey, "when we yield, I hope it will not be merely to get our dinner, gen|tlemen. &mdash; When we yield, Archer &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Don't addre&s;s your&s;elf to me," interrupted Archer, &s;truggling with his pride, "you have no farther occa&s;ion to try to win me&mdash;I have no power, no party, you &s;ee! &mdash;and now I find that I have no friends, I don't care what becomes of my&s;elf. &mdash; I &s;uppo&s;e I'm to be given up as ring|leader.&mdash;Here's this Fi&s;her, and a party of his Fi&s;hermen, were going to tie me hand and foot, if I had not knocked him down, ju&s;t as you came to the door, De Grey; and now perhaps you will join Fi&s;her's party again&s;t me."</P>
<P>De Grey was going to a&s;&s;ure him, that he had no intention of joining any party, when a &s;udden change appeared in Archer's counte|nance.</P>
<P>"Silence!" cried Archer, in an imperious tone, and there was &s;ilence. Some one was heard to whi&s;tle the beginning of a tune, that was perfectly new to every body pre&s;ent, ex|cept to Archer, who immediately whi&s;tled the conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>"Yes, but we are barred out here."</P>
<P>"Round to the window then, and fill our bag; we'll let it down, my lad, in a trice, bar me out who can!"</P>

<P>"Off with you then; we've enough, and thank you."</P>
<P>A delightful review was now made of their trea&s;ure; bu&s;y hands arranged and &s;orted the heterogeneous ma&s;s.

<P>"And you, Town&s;end," &s;aid Archer, "may look like a wit, if you will; but you will never be a hero."</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="229">
"No, no," replied Town&s;end, "wits are never heroes, becau&s;e they are wits&mdash;you are out of your wits, and therefore may &s;et up for a hero."</P>

<P>Archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it de&s;erved; for his eye was fixed upon De Grey.&mdash;"What is De Grey thinking of?" he a&s;ked impatiently.</P>
<P>"I am thinking," &s;aid De Grey, "that Dr. Middleton mu&s;t believe that I have be|trayed his confidence in me.

<P>"Well then, I'll give up to do what is <HI>ho|nourable,"</HI> &s;aid Archer.</P>

<P>"<HI>Rea&s;onable!</HI> &mdash; Oh, the fir&s;t thing that a man of &s;pirit &s;hould think of is, what is <HI>honourable.</HI>"</P>

<P>"But you cannot think any thing honour|able, or the contrary, without rea&s;oning; and as to what you call feeling, it's only a quick &s;ort of rea&s;oning."</P>
<P>"The quicker the better," &s;aid Archer.</P>
<P>"Perhaps not," &s;aid De Grey, "we are apt to rea&s;on be&s;t, when we are not in quite &s;o great a burry."</P>

<P>"No; but I &s;hould never have thought of heading a Barring out, if he had not &s;hewn partiality; and if you had flown into a pa&s;&s;ion with me openly, at once, for pulling down your &s;cenery, which would have been quite natural, and not have gone &s;lily and forbid us the hou&s;e, out of revenge, there would have been none of this work."</P>

<P>"You are a good friend!" &s;aid Archer, and with great eagerne&s;s be pulled down the fortifi|cations, whil&s;t every hand a&s;&s;i&s;ted. The room was re&s;tored to order in a few minutes; the &s;hutters were thrown open, the cheerful light let in. The windows were thrown up, and the fir&s;t feeling of the fre&s;h air was delightful. The

<P>But alas! they were not yet at liberty! The idea of Dr. Middleton, and the dread of his vengeance, &s;mote their hearts!

<P>"Sir," &s;aid Archer, "I brought five gui|neas with me to &s;chool &mdash; this guinea is all that I have left."</P>
<P>Dr. Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him, with a look of approbation; and told him that it &s;hould be applied to the re|pairs of the &s;chool-room. The re&s;t of the boys waited in &s;ilence for the doctor's &s;entence a|gain&s;t them; but not with tho&s;e looks of abject fear, with which boys u&s;ually expect the &s;en|tence of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall return from the play-ground, all of you," &s;aid Dr. Middieton, "one quarter of an hour &s;ooner, for two months to come, than the re&s;t of your companions. A bell &s;hall ring at the appointed time. I give you an opportu|nity of recovering my confidence by your punc|tuality."</P>

<P>"The rea&s;on," re&s;umed Dr. Middleton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ving now returned to the u&s;ual benignity of his manner, &mdash; "The rea&s;on why I de&s;ired, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne of you &s;hould go to that building," (point|ing out of the window), was this: I had been informed, that a gang of Gyp&s;ies had &s;lept there the night before I &s;poke to you, one of whom was dangerou&s;ly ill of a putrid &s;ever.

<P>"The old woman," continued the doctor, "whom you employed to buy food, has e&s;caped the fever, but &s;he has not e&s;caped a gaol, whi|ther &s;he was &s;ent ye&s;terday, for having defraud|ed you of your money."</P>

<P>The paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder-box.</P>

<P>"And did you de&s;ire him not to pay for them?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Archer, "he had half a crown on purpo&s;e to pay for them."</P>
<P>"I know he had; but he cho&s;e to apply it to his own private u&s;e, and gave it to the Gyp&s;ey to buy twelve buns for his own eating.

<P>A loud cry, in which Archer's voice was heard mo&s;t di&s;tinctly, declared De Grey's inno|cence. Dr. Middleton looked round at their eager, hone&s;t faces, with benevolent approba|tion.</P>
