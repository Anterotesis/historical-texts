<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF A MOST <HI>Efficacious Medicine</HI> FOR SORE EYES.</HEAD>
<P>THROUGH an earne&s;t De&s;ire to be u&s;eful in my Profe&s;&s;ion, the Prac|tice of Phy&s;ic, to which I was led by a &s;trong natural Inclination, I was always very attentive to Matters of Fact, and the real Cures that fell under my Ob&s;ervation. Of the&s;e I &s;aw many performed upon <HI>&s;ore Eyes</HI> by Doctor <HI>Luke Rugeley:</HI> whereupon I applied to a very under&s;tanding Apothe|cary
<PB N="2" REF="6">of his particular Acquaintance and mine, and endeavoured, though without Effect, to procure &s;ome Knowledge of the Medicine he made u&s;e of. After the Doctor's Death I &s;till pur&s;ued my Enquiry, by &s;earching into his printed Books, and Manu&s;cript Papers, and particularly into a very curious <HI>Materia Medica</HI> left by Him: but all in vain; 'till at length a Per&s;on, whom I believe he had employed in making his Medicine, came to me; and for a pe|cuniary Reward, joined to a Promi&s;e of not divulging it to his Prejudice, delivered me up the genuine Receipt, in the Doc|ctor's own Hand-Writing; which, as I reformed, improved, and u&s;ed it many Years, is as follows.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<HEAD>THE RECEIPT.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE of prepared Tutty, one Ounce; of <HI>Lapis Haematites</HI> prepared, two Scruples; of the be&s;t Aloes prepared, twelve Grains; of prepared Pearl, four Grains. Put them into a Porphyry, or Marble Mortar, and rub them with a Pe&s;tle of the &s;ame Stone very carefully, with a &s;ufficient Quantity of Viper's Grea&s;e, or Fat, to make a <HI>Lini|ment;</HI> to be u&s;ed daily, Morning or Evening, or both, according to the Conveniency of the Patient: as hereafter directed.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<P>This Medicine I &s;oon tried, and, though a Compo&s;ition, found it &s;o &s;urprizingly beneficial, that by the right U&s;e of it not one in five Hundred mi&s;&s;ed of a Cure: un|le&s;s their Di&s;order proceeded from a Vene|real Taint.</P>
<P>Several Years after I had been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Secret, in turning over &s;ome Manu|&s;cripts of Sir <HI>Theodore Mayerne,</HI> I found he had known the &s;ame Ointment, or Lini|ment, and had entered it in his <HI>Pharma|copoea,</HI> under his own Name: though I af|terwards di&s;covered, that it was not origi|nally his, but had been communicated to him by Sir <HI>Matthew Li&s;ter,</HI> a Member of the College of Phy&s;icians; who had per|formed a Cure with it on a Lady <HI>Savile,</HI> which Sir <HI>Theodore</HI> thought a very extraor|dinary one. And 'tis very probable, that he afterwards communicated it to Dr. <HI>Tho|mas
<PB N="5" REF="9">Rugeley,</HI> Father of Dr. <HI>Luke Rugeley:</HI> as I find they were Cotemporaries, and Friends.</P>
<P>The Method, which has be&s;t &s;ucceeded with me in facilitating the efficacious U&s;e of this Liniment, is to bleed, and bli&s;ter in the Neck and behind the Ears, in order to draw off the Humors from the Eyes; and afterwards, according to the Degree of the Inflammation, or Acrimony of the Juices, to make a Drain by I&s;&s;ues between the Shoulders, or a perpetual Bli&s;ter. And for wa&s;hing the Eyes, I generally recommend Spring Water: which I think preferable to any &s;pirituous Lotion, whether &s;imple or compound. And the be&s;t inward Medicines I have experienced to be Con&s;erve of Ro&s;e|mary Flowers; Antiepileptic Powders, &s;uch as <HI>Pulvis ad Guttetam;</HI> Betony, Sage, Ro&s;emary, Eyebright, wild Valerian Root,
<PB N="6" REF="10">Ca&s;tor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wa&s;hed down with a Tea made of &s;ome of the &s;ame Ingredients: as al&s;o Drops of <HI>Spirit. Lavendulae compo&s;it.</HI> and <HI>Sal volat. oleos.</HI></P>
<P>If the Inflammation returns, drawing about &s;ix Ounces of Blood from the Temples by Leaches, or Cupping on the Shoulders, is very proper.</P>
<P>The Liniment is to be applied with a &s;mall Hair Pencil, the Eye winking or a little opened.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting the Cure of &s;ore Eyes, I have been &s;ometimes &s;urprized by want of Succe&s;s; 'till at length I found, that the Cau&s;e was a lurking intermitting Fever, every Fit of which affected the Eyes, and rendered their Di&s;order ob&s;tinate: where|fore upon taking off the Fever by a proper
<PB N="7" REF="11">U&s;e of the Bark, the Cure has been ef|fectually performed.</P>
<P>This Medicine has cured many, who&s;e Eyes were covered with opake <HI>Films,</HI> and <HI>Cicatrices</HI> left by Inflammations and Apo&s;|tems of the <HI>Cornea;</HI> which, though they happen to Per&s;ons of all Conditions, yet are more common among the poorer Sort of People: many of whom were &s;o totally deprived of Sight, as to be under a Nece&s;&s;ity of being led to me; and after &s;ome time could perfectly well find their Way without a Guide, to my great Satisfaction. And it is not only very beneficial in &s;uch Ca&s;es, but al&s;o where there is an exce&s;&s;ive Pain in the Eyes, &s;hooting thence up into the Head: as I particularly remember in a great Lady, who had &s;uch Pains in her &s;ore Eyes, and Head, that &s;he had, when I fir&s;t &s;aw
<PB N="8" REF="12">her, taken about fifty Drops of <HI>Lau|danum</HI> thrice in twenty four Hours, if I remember right; of which Complaints &s;he and many others have been relieved by this Medicine, without the Help of any Opiate.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ani&s;&s;on,</HI> who was &s;ent hither with the Duke <HI>d'Aumont,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioner for &s;ettling a Treaty of Commerce with <HI>England,</HI> brought me recommendatory Letters from &s;ome Friends in <HI>France.</HI> I ob&s;erved a great Sorene&s;s and Weakne&s;s in his Eyes: of which the Application of my Medicine very &s;oon cured him. Where|upon he a&s;&s;ured me, that he would pro|cure me from the King his Ma&s;ter any Reward I &s;hould think fit to ask for the Secret; he being accu&s;tomed to oblige his Subjects that way: but I an&s;wered him, that
<PB N="9" REF="13">I was then bound by a Promi&s;e to conceal it.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved (contrary to the com|mon Practice, and to the Opinion which I my&s;elf entertained in my earlier Days, and communicated to the Public in the Introduction to my <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory of Jamaica</HI>) that Cathartics, e&s;pecially with the Addition of <HI>Mercury,</HI> are prejudicial in the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Eyes, which are cured by this Medicine.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o worthy of Remark, that Peo|ple afflicted with weak Eyes are over-fond of Hoodwinking, or covering them from the Light; which &s;ometimes retards the Cure, by keeping their Eyes too warm: and therefore I have con&s;tantly advi&s;ed them to throw away the&s;e Coverings, as
<PB N="10" REF="14">&s;oon as they could po&s;&s;ibly bear the Light.</P>
<P>I was intimately acquainted with Dr. <HI>William Stokeham,</HI> a very ingenious Gen|tleman, Phy&s;ician to King <HI>William</HI> III. who had formerly &s;pent &s;ome Years at <HI>Pa|dua,</HI> and had been acquainted with the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians of that Univer&s;ity, and al&s;o with <HI>Tachenius</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Chemi&s;ts of the la&s;t Age. He told me, he had learnt the great Virtue of <HI>Viper's Grea&s;e or Fat,</HI> in the Cure of Di&s;|ca&s;es of the Eyes; which is recommended for that Purpo&s;e by <HI>Daniel Ludovicus,</HI> in his Book <HI>De Pharmacia moderno &s;eculo applicanda, Gothae,</HI> 1671. 12^o. And this, indeed, I judged &s;o very rea&s;onable, that I &s;ub&s;tituted that Grea&s;e, or Fat, in the Place of the Hog's Lard, which was in the original
<PB N="11" REF="15">Receipt; and found, that it added &s;o much to the Efficacy of the Medicine, as to make it do, what I thought, Wonders. And as I was not bound to Secrecy, with regard to this Improvement, I communicated it to the late Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot:</HI> who, after re|peated Trials of that Fat alone on &s;ore Eyes, had &s;o high an Opinion of its Vir|tues, that he looked on it as equally bene|ficial with the whole Medicine.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince read in &s;ome <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary Letters,</HI> that Serpent's Fat is u&s;ed by the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indians,</HI> for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is an Ob&s;ervation made by many Na|turali&s;ts, that tho&s;e Serpents ca&s;t their Skins every Year, and with them the Coverings of their Eyes: but how far, or whether
<PB N="12" REF="16">at all, their Fat is concerned in this <HI>Phae|nomenon,</HI> I leave to others to determine.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t eminent and learned Chirurgical Authors, to whom I had a particular Regard in my Practice, cautions his Readers again&s;t the U&s;e of Oil in Di&s;|ca&s;es of the Eyes: by which, I &s;uppo&s;e, he meant Olive-Oil. Agreeable to this Cau|tion, I confe&s;s, I never u&s;ed any Oil, either alone, or mixed with other Medicines, for the Eyes; being unwilling to try Remedies, who&s;e Effects were doubtful, and may po&s;&s;ibly be pernicious: which I afterwards ob&s;erved to be the Ca&s;e with regard to Olive-Oil, when u&s;ed by &s;ome People (to whom I had given the Liniment) in order to make it more liquid, upon dry|ing; for the Liniment, in that State, has
<PB N="13" REF="17">cau&s;ed very con&s;iderable Complaints. This, in my Opinion, proceeds from &s;ome hot, &s;harp Particles, contained in the Oil; though it is generally reckoned very &s;oft and mild in outward and inward U&s;e: for I remember, when at <HI>Montpellier,</HI> I was informed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Magnol,</HI> and others of my Acquaintance there, that the feeding of tame Rabbits with Olive Leaves, in want of other Food, has cau&s;ed their making bloody Urine.</P>
<P>I had formerly, as already &s;aid, pro|mi&s;ed Secrecy with regard to this Medi|cine: which I have religiou&s;ly kept 'till now, that I think my&s;elf, for many Rea|&s;ons, abundantly ab&s;olved. I have had &s;ome other Medicines of the like Nature com|municated to me under the &s;ame Re&s;tric|tion: and exclu&s;ive of the&s;e few Ca&s;es,
<PB N="14" REF="18">I cannot charge my&s;elf with making the lea&s;t My&s;tery of my Practice. For in Con|&s;ultations, in a Number of Ca&s;es of Im|portance, I have been always very free, and open; far from following the Exam|ple of &s;ome Phy&s;icians of good Morals and great Reputation, who have on many Oc|ca&s;ions thought proper to conceal Part of their own acquired Knowledge, alledging the Maxim: <HI>Artis e&s;t celare Artem.</HI> And that I have not been inclined to conceal or monopolize Medicines of great U&s;e, the following In&s;tance will &s;ufficiently &s;hew.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Southwell,</HI> a very worthy Pre&s;ident of the Royal Society, who was a Patron to many Per&s;ons of Merit, and a|mong others to Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> told me, that the Captain in Conver&s;ation let
<PB N="15" REF="19">him know, that his Family, at <HI>Exmouth</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> had a &s;ecret Medicine, whereby they infallibly cured all Men and Bea&s;ts, bit by mad Dogs and other Creatures. Whereupon I earne&s;tly entreat|ed Sir <HI>Robert</HI> to u&s;e his Intere&s;t with the Captain, to procure, if po&s;&s;ible, a full Ac|count of it, as a Matter of great Con&s;e|quence to the Public. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> readily complied, and at his Reque&s;t Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> obtained from his Relations the Account thereof, which I publi&s;hed entire in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> N^o. 237, with all the nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;tances to be ob&s;erved: &s;everal of which were after|wards omitted by the Abridgers of that Paper. But &s;oon after the &s;aid Account had been put into my Hands, having a&s;&s;ur|ed Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> that <HI>Jews-Ears,</HI> mentioned therein as a principal Ingredient of the
<PB N="16" REF="20">Medicine, mu&s;t be a Mi&s;take, ina&s;much as that Vegetable is pernicious, taken inward|ly; I de&s;ired him to procure a Sample of the Herb &s;o named in the Account, in order to examine what it was, and likewi&s;e a Do&s;e of the Medicine, to know the Quan|tity to be taken. This occa&s;ioned both the one and the other to be &s;ent up from the Family; by which means I di&s;covered, that it really was, not <HI>Jews-Ears,</HI> but, the <HI>Lichen cinereus terre&s;tris</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> who had fir&s;t publicly taken notice of it, in his Catalogue of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plants, printed in the Year 1670: He at the &s;ame time wondering, that it had e&s;caped the Ob&s;er|vation of all former Botani&s;ts. And this In&s;tance, by the by, &s;hews the U&s;efulne&s;s of ob&s;erving non-de&s;cript Simples; which may po&s;&s;ibly be found, as his &s;ince was, to be of great Importance to the Welfare
<PB N="17" REF="21">of Mankind. This Point being &s;ettled, I accompanied the Publication of the Letter, or Account, with a Remark; without which, as manife&s;tly appears, it either would have had no Effect, or have been of bad Con|&s;equence. I at the &s;ame time acquainted Mr. <HI>Petiver,</HI> Mr. <HI>Doody,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rand,</HI> and other Botani&s;ts, with the Di&s;covery of this Matter; and recommended to them to pro|vide a Quantity of this <HI>Lichen,</HI> &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all Occa&s;ions. It was accord|ingly made u&s;e of with the &s;ame Succe&s;s, with which it has ever &s;ince been attended.</P>
