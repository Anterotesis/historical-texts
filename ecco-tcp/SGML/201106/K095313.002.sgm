<P>IN the religious hou&s;e to which O&s;wald had retired, was a Monk, called Reginhald, who&s;e mind but ill &s;uited his profe&s;&s;ion, or his re&s;idence in a &s;eat of piety. He was brother to Grey, and by his intere&s;t had been not long &s;ince admitted into the Mona&s;tery, and promoted to &s;ome degree of dignity and authori|ty. His manners were equally brutal with tho&s;e of Grey, but le&s;s di&s;gui&s;ed by art and hypocri&s;y. He was like him, abject and &s;ervile, but by no means &s;o well &s;killed in the arts of flattery: in&s;olent and a&s;&s;um|ing, but not careful to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e who feared and tho&s;e who defied his power. Hence was he frequently controuled and mortified by his bre|thren, whom he dreaded from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own exce&s;&s;es; and who dete&s;ted and &s;corned him in|deed, yet feared the power which &s;upported, or &s;eemed to &s;upport him. They regarded his brother as the fa|vourite of Lord Raymond, and Lord Raymond as heir to the hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury, and already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all its greatne&s;s. To purchace his protection, therefore, they turned their eyes from his offences, and &s;uffered him to di&s;grace and di&s;turb their hou&s;e by &s;candalous exce&s;&s;es, utterly &s;ubver&s;ive of holy di&s;cipline and or|der. Drunkenne&s;s, and riot, and lewdne&s;s, had oft|entimes profaned their walls with impunity. They
<PB N="96" REF="3">lamented the&s;e enormities of their unworthy brother; but, in&s;tead of di&s;clo&s;ing and puni&s;hing them, lament|ed to each other in &s;ecret, le&s;t they &s;hould forfeit the favour and protection of Lord Raymond; although the mi&s;creant had been &s;carcely known, and was utterly unnoticed and di&s;regarded by this Lord.</P>
<P>Grey had conceived a &s;udden hope of preventing the effects which the flight of O&s;wald threatened, by means of this Reginhald; and, if not of gaining young William into his own power, at lea&s;t of pre|venting any emi&s;&s;aries from &s;preading the intelligence of his e&s;cape to &s;anctuary, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his mo|ther. This it was that determined him to depart in|&s;tantly, and to vi&s;it this mona&s;tery! but his brother, active and officious in every deed of ba&s;ene&s;s, had al|ready prevented his de&s;ires, O&s;wald had happily reached the mona&s;tery, and Reginhald was among the fir&s;t to demand the rea&s;on of his appearance. Scarce|ly could he re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion until O&s;wald had com|pleated his &s;tory; and, then, bur&s;t forth with un|bounded rage into the vile&s;t and &s;evere&s;t reproaches. He charged him with fal&s;ehood and treachery; de|clared him&s;elf re&s;olved in&s;tantly to learn the real na|ture of his crime, and purpo&s;e of his flight; and, for this rea&s;on, to repair in per&s;on to the ca&s;tle. In the mean time, with an a&s;&s;umed air of authority, he ordered that this fugitive &s;hould be &s;trictly guarded, and kept from all intercour&s;e till his return. O&s;wald heard his brutal virulence and pa&s;&s;ion, not without &s;ome terror, which was noted, and regarded as an indication of guilt. The directions of Reginhald were obeyed, and he him&s;elf now ha&s;tened to inform his brother of this event. He met him when he had but ju&s;t rode a few paces from the ca&s;tle; whither Grey in&s;tantly returned with the Monk.</P>
<P>They retired to a private conference with equal eagerne&s;s, and with minds equally prepared for out|rage or treachery. The Monk prevented the enquiries of his brother, by relating what had ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed at the mona&s;tery. Grey expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ullen joy, when informed that O&s;wald was clo&s;ely guarded, and, for
<PB N="97" REF="4">the pre&s;ent, effectually prevented from &s;preading his &s;aucy tale, or pur&s;uing the de&s;ign for which he had fled. He commended the zeal of Reginhald; and, &s;eizing his arm with an a&s;pect, earne&s;t, and my&s;teri|ou&s;ly &s;olemn, he declared, that both their future for|tunes depended on confining O&s;wald from all inter|cour&s;e, and gaining young William into their own power and di&s;po&s;al. The rude Monk, who&s;e fir&s;t thoughts were ever to recur to violence, in&s;tantly de|clared for &s;eizing both, and forcing them from their retreat: but he was &s;topped by Grey, who cen&s;ured &s;uch procedure as dangerous and unwarrantable; and pronounced it nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures the mo&s;t deliberate and mo&s;t cautiou&s;ly concerted. He pro|ceeded to di&s;clo&s;e all the tran&s;actions of Lord Ray|mond from his fir&s;t arrival at the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury, all the efforts made to &s;hake the con&s;tancy of Ela, and all the oppo&s;ition and di&s;dain of that proud Coun|te&s;s. He began to explain how much their fortunes mu&s;t be advanced by finding means of conquering her re&s;olution, and by the final &s;ucce&s;s of Lord Raymond in obtaining full and indi&s;putable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands and dignities of the hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury. But Reginhald, con&s;cious that his own &s;ecurity from di&s;|grace and puni&s;hment depended on the influence and protection of this Lord, needed no inducement to concur in the de&s;igns and practices of his brother. He broke in upon his di&s;cour&s;e with a pa&s;&s;ionate heat, and loudly condemned all his late proceedings. 'Why,' &s;aid he, <Q>was not I made acquainted with your difficulties? why were not their hands forci|bly joined? I &s;hould have at once pronounced the nuptial benediction over them, and without regard to female pride or &s;cruples, have united them for ever in tho&s;e bands, which no human power can rend a&s;under.</Q>&mdash;Grey again began to condemn his violence, and to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of caution, when their conference was &s;uddenly interrupted by a do|me&s;tic, who &s;urpri&s;ed them by declaring that he &s;ought the Monk, and had in charge to conduct him to the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="5">
The mind of this unhappy lady had long been vio|lently agitated, the true cau&s;e of that languor and malady which oppre&s;&s;ed her gentle frame. The hopes &s;he had conceived of the &s;afety of her &s;on, and the &s;peedy arrival of friends and deliverers, had acted on her hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits like a powerful medicine, and checked the progre&s;s of her di&s;order. She had now lei&s;ure to turn her thoughts to her hu&s;band, and to weigh tho&s;e accounts of his fate which O&s;wald had ra&s;hly conveyed to her. The idea of his di&s;loyalty was piercing: &s;he revolved it frequently: &s;he rea&s;on|ed on the intelligence &s;he had received; &s;he believed; &s;he doubted; &s;he indulged her &s;u&s;picions; and &s;trove to bani&s;h them, by turns. Ill were tho&s;e reflections &s;uited to re&s;tore her impaired health; yet &s;he dwelt upon them. The faithful Elinor, from whom &s;he could not conceal her thoughts, in vain endeavoured to compo&s;e her di&s;tractions, and to allay her inward grief: &s;till &s;he tormented her&s;elf with reflections on the &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;ehood of her Lord, and on his un|happy fate; when the attendant ca&s;ually di&s;covered from a window the approach of Reginhald, and ob|&s;erved with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e that a religious man, who by his habit &s;eemed of the neighbouring mona&s;tery, was now entering the ca&s;tle. <Q>He comes with news of my &s;on,</Q> &s;aid the Counte&s;s ha&s;tily; <Q>Let him be called hither.&mdash;And, alas, this di&s;tracted brea&s;t hath but too much need of &s;piritual coun&s;el and comfort.</Q></P>
<P>A dome&s;tic was in&s;tantly di&s;patched to &s;eek the Monk; who now appeared before the Counte&s;s. Naturally ba&s;e and mean, and never before admitted into &s;uch a pre&s;ence, he &s;tood aba&s;hed and confu&s;ed; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own vile purpo&s;es &s;erved to increa&s;e his di&s;order, His a&s;pect, in which the &s;en|&s;ual and malignant pa&s;&s;ions had fixed their &s;eat, and his deportment, which was that of the rude hind or midnight brawler, not of the holy and lettered clerk, were &s;urveyed by the Counte&s;s with &s;udden di&s;gu&s;t. She &s;huddered, as at the view of &s;ome loath&s;ome ani|mal: yet, a&s;&s;uming a placid air, and endeavouring to
<PB N="99" REF="6">conceal her di&s;like, &s;he a&s;ked of his order and re&s;i|dence. No &s;ooner had he named the brotherhood of Sarum, than rai&s;ing her&s;elf from the couch on which &s;he leaned, 'You then' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>bring me news of my &s;on&mdash;di&s;patched to acquaint me with his &s;afe ar|rival within your holy walls&mdash;Is it not &s;o?</Q> Regin|hald coldly an&s;wered, that her &s;on was &s;afe, and had been depo&s;ited in the mona&s;tery hy his conduc|tor. The Counte&s;s, with cla&s;ped hands and earne&s;t accents, uttered a prayer for his protection. Elinor was tenderly affected; and uniting her fervours with tho&s;e of her beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, commended young William to every &s;aint and holy angel. The Monk &s;tood unmoved, and &s;carcely could a&s;&s;ume the appear|ance of devotion, ju&s;t as far as to pronounce a cold a&s;&s;ent to their petitions. The Counte&s;s was on the point of imploring his protection for her &s;on, but the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;he had conceived at his a&s;pect, and which was encrea&s;ed by his demeanour, repre&s;&s;ed that thought. She contented her&s;elf with &s;peaking her hopes in general, that his innocence and his wrongs would not fail to rai&s;e him friends in the hou&s;e of pie|ty and charity. She &s;poke of the oppre&s;&s;ion which &s;he her&s;elf had &s;uffered, in terms of bitterne&s;s and indignation: and &s;eemed to demand, as her ju&s;t right, the vigorous interpo&s;ition of every good man for her relief, but more e&s;pecially the dutiful and faithful of|fices of tho&s;e holy men who had experienced her fa|vour and munificence. The &s;ilence of Reginhald gave her an occa&s;ion of repeating and enforcing her di&s;cour&s;e: but her di&s;cour&s;e was directed to an un|friendly ear. The wicked Monk had fixed his eyes upon an object, which totally diverted his attention from the Counte&s;s. Near her couch there &s;tood a ta|ble, on which, among &s;ome female ornaments, was depo&s;ited a ring, an ancient and precious jewel, which had long been the di&s;tingui&s;hing ornament of her noble hou&s;e, and bore its en&s;igns armorial curiou&s;|ly impre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ight of this in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted a treacherous purpo&s;e to the Monk; for which it was nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the jewel. His &s;itua|tion
<PB N="100" REF="7">was convenient for &s;eizing it, unnoticed by Ela or her attendant. He watched a favourable moment to convey it to his bo&s;om; and, having once &s;ecured his prize, he was more at lei&s;ure to an&s;wer the di&s;|cour&s;e of the Counte&s;s, to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome appearance of gravity, and to affect the dignity and &s;piritual authori|ty of his function. He declared, that, within their walls, her &s;on could not &s;uffer wrong: but that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him thither for protection. Nature and the royal plea&s;ure pointed to his noble kin&s;man Raymond as his true protector.&mdash; The Coun|te&s;s prepared to expre&s;s her indignation, but with an in&s;olence which he mi&s;took for grave authority; he warned her to beware of froward pride. <Q>Their liege Lord, he &s;aid, had graciou&s;ly con&s;idered her wi|dowed &s;tate, and provided relief and comfort.&mdash; Her hand, her affection, and her obedience were now due to Lord Raymond: &s;uch was the King's com|mand. Heaven had approved his kind purpo&s;e, and would not fail to puni&s;h that ob&s;tinacy and haughty perver&s;ene&s;s, which rejected its ble&s;&s;ings.</Q>&mdash;And dar|e&s;t thou, abandoned and hateful wretch,'&mdash;thus did the Counte&s;s &s;uffer her virtuous anger to break forth: <Q>Dare&s;t thou profane the name of heaven? art thou devoted to its &s;ervice, and do&s;t thou flatter the ba&s;e|ne&s;s, and would&s;t thou promote the lewd purpo&s;es of him who hath renounced its laws, and defies its ven|geance?</Q> &mdash;'Thy ob&s;tinacy be upon thine own head!' This was the reply of Reginhald, who was hardened again&s;t all reproof, and impatient to &s;eek his brother. He turned away in &s;ullen di&s;dain, and left the Coun|te&s;s in wonder and ju&s;t re&s;entment at his brutal in&s;o|lence; nor did this interview tend to allay the fears and &s;u&s;picions of a fond mother. <Q>If the oppre&s;&s;ion of Lord Raymond could have its mini&s;ters and fa|vourers among the profe&s;&s;ed votaries of religion, where might innocence find refuge; or where &s;eek its ju&s;t redre&s;s?</Q> She now dreaded that the &s;acred privileges of &s;anctaury might not find the due regard, as her enemy &s;eemed to have corrupted the reverend brethren, and to have gained them over to his wicked
<PB N="101" REF="8">purpo&s;es. She wi&s;hed &s;he had contended with her malady, and accompanied her &s;on; again &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he had not ra&s;hly entru&s;ted him to fal&s;e and treache|rous guardians. <Q>Her pre&s;ence might have proved a &s;ufficient protection to him: Raymond could not dare openly to have rai&s;ed his arm again&s;t him: and &s;urely the outrage and u&s;urpation of this Lord could not long be concealed.</Q>&mdash;Thus did &s;he con|demn her conduct, and torment her &s;oul with gloomy and terrible imaginations; tho' yet unacquainted with the dangers and di&s;tre&s;s now prepared for her&s;elf and her &s;on.</P>

<P>REGINHALD had &s;ought his brother, and recounted all his interview with Ela. Grey &s;till accu&s;ed him of violence and turbulence, and urged the nece&s;&s;ity of well-timed di&s;&s;imulation, of art, cau|tion, and &s;mooth addre&s;s. The Monk was provoked at this affectation of &s;uperior wi&s;dom; and in&s;tead of retorting his reproof, di&s;played the &s;tolen jewel, in &s;ilent and contemptuous triumph. Grey was too well ver&s;ed in the arts of fraud and mi&s;chief, not to con|ceive at once, that this ring was to be u&s;ed for deceiv|ing the brethren of the mona&s;tery, or abu&s;ing O&s;wald, as occa&s;ions might require, by pretended orders and directions from the Counte&s;s. He viewed it eagerly, and regarded it, (not without rea&s;on) as an in&s;trument of his purpo&s;es, too important to be intru&s;ted wholly to the violent hands of Reginhald. He commended his zeal and addre&s;s, which he, confidently promi&s;ed, &s;hould, in due time, meet their full reward: he invited him to refre&s;hment; reminded him of his &s;atigue: and that the hour of re&s;t approached: he promi&s;ed that by the dawn of morning, he him&s;elf would be ready to ac|company him to the mona&s;tery, where he made no doubt of happily accompli&s;hing their purpo&s;es, and lay|ing a firm foundation of their future fortunes. Regin|hald yielded to his in&s;tances, and retired. Grey re|paired
<PB N="102" REF="9">without delay to the apartment of Lord Ray|mond, and appeared before him with a face of joy and &s;atisfaction. He congratulated him upon the pro|&s;pect of a &s;peedy and final accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes: he briefly related the conduct of his brother at the mona&s;tery, his reception of O&s;wald, and the means already taken to prevent that traytor from officiou&s;ly &s;preading his tale: he declared his pur|po&s;e of &s;eeking him in&s;tantly in his retirement; and was fully a&s;&s;ured (he &s;aid) that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Monk, (who&s;e zeal and vigilance he prai&s;ed) he &s;hould be able to bring O&s;wald to that puni&s;hment which his fal&s;ehood merited, and to gain young Wil|liam into his ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al, the &s;ure means of pre|vailing over the pride of Ela, and engaging her to a full compliance with his wi&s;hes. Raymond wonder|ed; but Grey repeated his confident a&s;&s;urances of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and departed with reque&s;ting his Lord patiently to wait the events, which the &s;ucceeding day mu&s;t produce.</P>
<P>It was now night; but fraud and intere&s;ted malice are &s;trangers to re&s;t. The Monk was wholly engaged by the thoughts of future favour and preferment; and Grey watched, like the great enemy of mankind, to en&s;nare the innocent, and to &s;educe the weak. He bu&s;ily revolved in his mind the late tran&s;actions, and his future de&s;igns. He thought of an expedient which Reignhald had mentioned, that of forcibly joining the hands of Raymond and the Counte&s;s, and pronounc|ing the nuptial ble&s;&s;ing without regard to her con&s;ent; an expedient which he now con&s;idered not as the &s;ug|ge&s;tion of ra&s;hne&s;s and unexperienced heat, but &s;uch as the be&s;t guided policy might have recour&s;e to, and &s;uch as their de&s;igns might nece&s;&s;arily require. In the mean time, he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to re&s;erve the di&s;po&s;al of young William to him&s;elf, and even to &s;ecrete him from Lord Raymond's power. If this Lord &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful, he might forget the &s;ervices of his creature, or not reward them to the full extent of his wi&s;hes. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this boy might hereafter enable him to revenge &s;uch neglect, by unexpectedly
<PB N="103" REF="10">producing a young heir to a&s;&s;ert his rights: or if the Counte&s;s &s;hould be relieved from her pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;i|on, and her &s;uitor recalled, or forced from her ca&s;tle; the important &s;ervice of re&s;toring her &s;on might atone for his former in&s;olence, and &s;hield him from puni&s;h|ment: or &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;es to de|&s;troy this child; this might be done more &s;ecurely in &s;ome place of private retirement; and more accepta|bly to his Lord, when executed without his know|ledge or participation. His own intere&s;t was the &s;ole object of his thoughts, and as to the means of ad|vancing it; to him, all were equally indifferent.</P>
<P>The dawn of morning &s;tole upon him, while he was anxiou&s;ly engaged in the&s;e reflections: and Re|ginhald now &s;tood before him, urging him to pur&s;ue his intended cour&s;e without further delay. He fir&s;t &s;ummoned &s;ome cho&s;en va&s;&s;als of Raymond, and, in the name of that Lord, ordered them to follow his &s;teps at &s;ome di&s;tance, and to hold them&s;elves ready to obey his orders. The brothers then took their way, and &s;oon reached the mona&s;tery. Here they found, that, notwith&s;tanding the directions of Regin|hald, the Lord Abbot had been made acquainted with the arrival of O&s;wald; had examined him in per&s;on, had heard, and was duely affected by his &s;tory; pro|mi&s;ed him protection, and that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t in all hone&s;t means of gaining redre&s;s for the injured Coun|te&s;s; and that at this very time he was &s;hut up in the apartment of O&s;wald, hearing, examining, and en|quiring &s;till more minutely into the circum&s;tances of all tho&s;e events which he related with &s;o much con|fidence, and with &s;uch appearance of integrity. The brothers congratulated each other on arriving &s;o op|portunely; and, at their de&s;ire were conducted into the &s;ame apartment. O&s;wald &s;tarted and trembled at the &s;ight of Grey; who, with a demeanour grave and &s;olemn, and with well affected humility, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Abbot in the following manner:</P>
<P><Q>Reverend father! This humane attention to the appearance of di&s;tre&s;s will be rewarded; and heaven forefend but that it &s;hould meet the ju&s;t return of
<PB N="104" REF="11">prai&s;e from every hone&s;t tongue: nor is there le&s;s honour due to your pious and charitable cares, be|cau&s;e, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, they are not called forth by real danger or calamity. You have entertained a fugitive already pardoned by his Lord; and an infant whom his fond mother is at this moment im|patient to embrace.&mdash;You wonder: but, vouch&s;afe me a favourable ear, I &s;hall un&s;old what &s;eems &s;o &s;trange and perplexing. This venerable brother|hood mu&s;t have heard how the royal &s;avour hath been extended to Lord Raymond, hath inve&s;ted him with all the power and dignity of the hou&s;e of Salibury, hath con&s;igned to his protection the wi|dow of that noble hou&s;e, and de&s;tined his hand for that of the gentle Counte&s;s. When Raymond fir&s;t arrived at her ca&s;tle, to execute the orders of his liege Lord, he found her, alas! &s;unk deep in &s;or|rowful reflections on the fate of her unhappy Lord, and but ill di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to his honourable pa&s;&s;ion; nor could his noble nature permit him to break in too precipitately upon her melancholy, by declaring his &s;uit, and demanding her con&s;ent.</Q>&mdash; Here O&s;wald would have interrupted his di&s;cour&s;e, but Grey, with a mild, yet commanding look, claim|ed a free and undi&s;turbed audience. The Abbot &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ent; and the cra&s;ty minion proceeded thus: <Q>A decent interval of retirement was allowed to her grief; and in the mean time her &s;uitor was entertained with the re&s;pect due to his greatne&s;s: nor was &s;he long a &s;tranger to his purpo&s;e; nor did &s;he di&s;dain his &s;uit, although &s;he &s;till deemed it di&s;honourable openly to admit a &s;econd lover, until &s;he had fully paid her duty to the memory of Lord William. In this interval, heaven was plea&s;ed to afflict the unhappy Lady with &s;evere &s;ick|ne&s;s: her fever was violent, and long and ob&s;tinate was her delirium. She raved, I know not how, of force and oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;he called upon her late Lord, who &s;he declared was yet alive, now in her ca&s;tle, and concealed from her by treachery and cruelty. She &s;poke of blood, of murder, of her &s;on, his
<PB N="105" REF="12">dangers and his enemies. Even when her bodily di&s;order began to abate, the di&s;order of her mind was &s;till unconquered: nor were tho&s;e wild vi&s;ions yet di&s;pelled, which had &s;o long tormented her. Her Di&s;cour&s;e indeed &s;eemed more con&s;i&s;tent, though the di&s;cour&s;e of madne&s;s, and, unhappily, impo&s;ed on the weakne&s;s and inexperience of her attendants. They indulged her madne&s;s, and per|&s;uaded her to fly, for they believed that Lord Ray|mond was really her per&s;ecutor: who, on his part, was only anxious for her recovery. For this, were his prayers ince&s;&s;antly breathed to heaven. For this, did he bind him&s;elf by &s;olemn vow, to reward the devotion of your hou&s;e, with ample donations: nor was his piety unnoticed, or his prayers rejected. Scarcely had the di&s;traction of this Lady prompted her to &s;end away her &s;on, and to retire from the ca&s;tle, when heaven was plea&s;ed, as it were mira|culou&s;ly, to awaken her from her frightful dreams, and re&s;tore her un&s;ettled rea&s;on. The fir&s;t &s;ign of recollection which &s;he di&s;covered, was, her orders to tho&s;e who had been deceived by her di&s;traction, and ra&s;hly conveyed her at midnight from her ca&s;tle, to conduct her back again. She was obeyed, and in&s;tantly called for Lord Raymond, acknowledged her infirmity, and entreated his pardon and indul|gence. He, noble and gentle Lord, expre&s;&s;ed no|thing but the mo&s;t rapturous joy at this happy change; earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing her to reward his love, and crown his wi&s;hes. No longer now reluctant, or in&s;en&s;ible to the happine&s;s which heaven and the royal favour had ordained for her, &s;he only reque&s;t|ed that &s;ome little re&s;pite might &s;till be granted, &s;ome time allowed to pay what farther duties the memory of her late Lord demanded. This holy fa|ther came opportunely to confirm her in tho&s;e &s;en|timents, and to direct her pious intentions. By his per&s;ua&s;ions am I ordered to attend him hither, di|rected by Lord Raymond, to enquire by what means and in what manner he may mo&s;t effectually di&s;charge his vow, and by the gentle Counte&s;s to
<PB N="106" REF="13">de&s;ire, that a &s;olemn requiem &s;hall, without delay, be performed by this reverend brotherhood to her departed Lord. I am &s;till farther to declare, that &s;he reflects with confu&s;ion on the late di&s;order of her mind, which had driven her young &s;on from her arms; that &s;he is impatient to embrace him; that, at her reque&s;t to Lord Raymond, he hath &s;ree|ly and fully pardoned the flight of this his attend|ant. Nothing now remains, but that both return, and &s;hare in that general joy which reigns in the ca&s;tle.</Q>&mdash;The Abbot wondered, and he&s;itated; O&s;|wald prepared to &s;peak, but Grey again prevented him.&mdash;<Q>To remove doubts, or &s;cruples,</Q> &s;aid he, turning to Reginhald, <Q>let us produce the token of our truth and fairly delivered charge. Behold, Lord Abbot, this ancient ring, the well-known &s;ig|net of the Counte&s;s, entru&s;ted to us from her fair hand! By this &s;he &s;peaks her plea&s;ure, that young William be in&s;tantly delivered to our care, that, without delay, we may conduct him to her noble pre&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P>The Abbot had li&s;tened with &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t, nor was his perplexity di&s;&s;ipated by the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech. The accounts which he had received from O&s;wald &s;eemed natural and con&s;i&s;tent; tho&s;e of Grey &s;ubtile and improbable: and, yet, this ring was &s;uch an atte&s;tation of his truth and integrity, as &s;eem|ed to warrant a full a&s;&s;ent. He wavered for a while, but endeavoured to per&s;uade him&s;elf that the orders which Grey delivered were real, and demanded his compliance; timorous by nature, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;trong imaginations of the power of Raymond, and the danger of his di&s;plea&s;ure. He therefore laboured to &s;uppre&s;s all his doubts; affected to be fully convinc|ed and &s;atisfied; and con&s;ented to deliver up young William to be conducted back to his mother by the Monk and Grey; who di&s;&s;embled their joy, and &s;tudied to compleat their &s;ucce&s;s, by &s;educing O&s;wald from his retreat. They exerted all their artifice to per&s;uade him that the re&s;entment of his Lord had totally &s;ub|&s;ided; that he could not but con&s;ent to the de&s;ires
<PB N="107" REF="14">of the gentle Counte&s;s, and forgive an hone&s;t though mi&s;taken zeal for the &s;ervice of a Lady, who in a few days was to be united with him, in the bands of love and wedlock. O&s;wald he&s;itated; he knew the fal&s;e|hood of &s;ome part of what Grey had declared; yet he conceived that he mu&s;t have delivered this jewel from the hand of the Counte&s;s, and by her command; and that, of con&s;equence, &s;he mu&s;t have been reconciled to her &s;uitor. He thought it natural, on &s;uch a re|conciliation, to conceal &s;ome late tran&s;actions: thus he endeavoured to account for the mi&s;repre&s;entations of Grey: yet &s;till he feared and doubted.&mdash;Grey, as by the authority of his Lord, and in his name, not only pronounced his full pardon, but a&s;&s;ured him of favour and reward. The Abbot condemned his ir|re&s;olution as weak and criminal, as highly prejudicial to his own intere&s;t, and an undutiful &s;u&s;picion of the truth and honour of his ma&s;ter. The &s;implicity and inexperience of the va&s;&s;al gave force to the&s;e &s;ollici|tations; he dreaded to renew the di&s;plea&s;ure of Ray|mond by delay or he&s;itation: he con&s;ented to return, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to Grey, who now led away his victims in triumph.</P>
<P>The party which Grey had appointed to attend him, &s;oon appeared in view, obeyed his &s;ignal, and advanced. At the &s;ight of armed men, the mi&s;guided O&s;wald felt all his &s;u&s;picions renewed; he trembled; and his fears were in&s;tantly confirmed. Grey, with an air of &s;ullen authority, ordered him to be &s;eized and bound; he attempted to expo&s;tulate, but was &s;i|lenced with all the in&s;olence of a &s;ucce&s;sful malice, committed to a guard, and led away a pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle; and, there, was this friend to the afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed con&s;igned to the dreary dungeon. The infant heir of Sali&s;bury was entru&s;ted to others of the party, who&s;e &s;ervices Grey purcha&s;ed by rich bribes, and in whom he chiefly confided. A kin&s;man he had upon the di&s;tant coa&s;t of Devon, to whom they were directed to convey their charge with &s;tricte&s;t care. Thus he re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;e of the young Lord for the pre&s;ent, as he relied on the attachment of this kin&s;|man,
<PB N="108" REF="15">and by his means might hereafter remove him to &s;ome &s;afe and &s;ecret re&s;idence, as his future pur|po&s;es might require.</P>

<P>THUS far the wicked arts of Grey had been compleatly &s;ucce&s;sful: and, now, he ha&s;tened to the pre&s;ence of Lord Raymond with his flattering congratulations. He acquainted him in a few words, that all the mi&s;chief which the flight of O&s;wald had threatened was now effectually prevented; that he had &s;afely di&s;po&s;ed of young William with &s;uch guar|dians as were devoted to his, and to his ma&s;ter's &s;er|vice; and that the fal&s;e &s;lave who had attempted to betray him, was now his pri&s;oner. Raymond won|dered; embraced his minion, and applauded his ad|dre&s;s and vigilance. In his fir&s;t violence of pride and re&s;entment he pronounced that O&s;wald &s;hould in&s;tant|ly be hanged upon the next tree. But Grey re&s;train|ed his pa&s;&s;ion; and entreated him to &s;u&s;pend the fate of this va&s;&s;al; and to re&s;erve the power of granting his forfeited life to the reque&s;ts of Ela, if this might hereafter contribute to conciliate her regards. At the name of Ela, Raymond fighed, and turned upon his creature, with an a&s;pect of perplexity and &s;orrow. 'Tru&s;t me,' &s;aid he, <Q>I am weary of this unprofit|able pur&s;uit; and would to heaven I had never &s;een this proud dame; never felt the power of her beau|ty! &mdash;This morning was I unexpectedly &s;ummoned to her pre&s;ence. I &s;aw the charming mourner: I &s;aw her tortured with fears. She had ju&s;t di&s;co|vered the lo&s;s of an ancient ring, the u&s;ual orna|ment of her hand, and although &s;he knows not by whom, or for what purpo&s;e, it may have been &s;e|creted, yet this incident hath awakened her &s;u&s;pi|cions, and &s;he dreads &s;ome farther de&s;ign upon her peace. But chiefly &s;he fears for her &s;on: &s;he con|demns her late conduct as weak and precipitate, and repents of having tru&s;ted the boy from her &s;ide.
<PB N="109" REF="16">At fir&s;t, &s;he made an effort to pre&s;erve her dignity, and, in the language of greatne&s;s and affected di&s;|dain, demanded how long my u&s;urpation was to be continued. I interrupted her with humble and ar|dent expre&s;&s;ions of love: &s;he wept, and was &s;till deaf to my &s;ollicitations. Yet, methought, &s;he &s;poke of her late Lord with le&s;s pride and exultati|on. If, &s;aid &s;he, he hath indeed paid the debt of nature, may heaven look on his offences with mer|cy, and protect his helple&s;s infant, and injured wi|dow! then, with earne&s;t and affecting accents &s;he entreated me to accept of all her wealth and mag|nificence, to indulge my wi&s;hes freely with the rich inheritance of her lordly hou&s;e: but not to pur&s;ue the ruin of an helple&s;s infant: to &s;uffer his mother to follow him in peace; to hide her grief, and wa&s;te her few melancholy days in the holy retirement of the mona&s;tery.&mdash;O my friend, who could &s;tand unmoved at her di&s;order? But I did not &s;uffer all my emotion to break out. I contented my&s;elf, in general, with entreating her to bani&s;h all gloomy thoughts, to expect happy days, to &s;tudy her real happine&s;s, and to command it. I then retired, im|patiently expecting your arrival, and your &s;age and friendly coun&s;el.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s which had hitherto attended the prac|tices and de&s;igns of Grey, gave him authority and con&s;equence with his Lord, and encouraged him to urge his advice boldly and violently. When he had fir&s;t informed him in general of the tran&s;actions of the mona&s;tery, he pre&s;t him to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly that new incidents might ari&s;e, new dangers threaten him, which might not always be prevented. He &s;poke with &s;everity of his irre&s;olute and timid conduct: a&s;ked, if it was his purpo&s;e to abandon all his glorious hopes, to return di&s;graced and rejected; to encounter &s;corn and reproach, as a per&s;on unworthy of the regards of this Lady, pre&s;umptuous and unju&s;t. Nothing could &s;ecure his honour from ruin, or perhaps his life from revenge, but his immediate nuptials with the Coun|te&s;s. Of this he &s;poke, as of an event ab&s;olutely in
<PB N="110" REF="17">the power of Raymond, and delayed only by his mi&s;|taken tenderne&s;s. He was heard with earne&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e: but when his Lord began to plead the difficul|ties he had encountered, and the ob&s;tinacy of Ela in denying her con&s;ent, he ha&s;tily interrupted him.&mdash; 'Let a day be appointed,' cried this minion, <Q>for the celebration of your nuptials, let it be known through the land, let your attendants be ordered to prepare for this event, and your knights directed to hold them&s;elves in &s;uch readine&s;s as the joyful occa&s;ion requires.&mdash;Let the re&s;t be my care.</Q> Raymond, who &s;till pre&s;erved a tender affection for the Counte&s;s, and remembered with horror how dangerou&s;ly &s;he had been affected by the in&s;olence of Grey, he&s;itated, and in&s;i&s;ted on a full explanation of this my&s;terious lan|guage. Grey again urged the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of prevailing in his pre&s;ent undertaking, both for his ho|nour and his &s;afety: the eternal infamy, nay, the ut|ter impo&s;&s;ibility of receding, after having already proceeded thus far. To this he added &s;ome artful prai&s;es of the Counte&s;s, and many animated ob&s;erva|tions on the happine&s;s of that man who &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;uch a trea&s;ure of beauty. When the pa&s;&s;ions of his Lord had by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e been rai&s;ed to the ut|mo&s;t degree of fervour, he began to flatter his hopes: 'This Lady,' &s;aid he, <Q>you at fir&s;t found reluctant, and no wonder: for &s;he had not been a&s;&s;ured that Lord William was really no more. Of this &s;he now &s;eems per&s;uaded, but regards his death as an event too recent, to admit another wooer. What though &s;he hath di&s;covered &s;uch impatience of your love? what though &s;he hath attempted to e&s;cape from this place? would &s;he not have per&s;evered in her de&s;ign? would &s;he not have continued her flight, if this reluctance and aver&s;ion had not been artfully a&s;&s;umed to give her honour and re&s;pect in the general eye? She affects to &s;ummon friends to re&s;cue her from your power; but &s;he hopes that they will interpo&s;e, and per&s;uade her to accept your hand: but do we delay 'till &s;ome new &s;uiter &s;hall ar|rive, and, under the pretence of relieving the op|pre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="111" REF="18">and revenging her wrongs, &s;hall &s;ucce&s;s|fully court her love, and build his own fortune on your di&s;grace and ruin?</Q>&mdash;Raymond was moved, and &s;eemed ready to pay implicit obedience to the dictates of his creature.&mdash;Grey then &s;poke of the zeal of Reginhald his brother, and his entire devotion to the &s;ervice of his noble patron. <Q>This faithful Monk, &s;aid he, will be of u&s;e. Ob&s;erve the Counte&s;s for &s;ome days; continue your fond wooing with all mode&s;t and re&s;pectful duty, but with un|abated zeal. She will &s;oon experience that the flight of O&s;wald hath not proved effectual to collect her creatures round her: and the di&s;appointment will depre&s;s her proud &s;pirit, and convince her that her own and her &s;on's fate &s;till depend on you. The day on which your attendants are taught to expect your nuptials, may perhaps find her con&s;enting to your wi&s;hes: but why &s;hould we demand or expect her formal con&s;ent? Reginhald &s;hall join your hands by virtue of his &s;acred authority, and pronounce the &s;olemn benediction which &s;hall make her your's for ever. Her heart &s;hall &s;ecretly applaud this gen|tle violence. At lea&s;t, her &s;on, re&s;tored to her arms, &s;hall be the purcha&s;e of your pardon.</Q>&mdash;Little of art was required to di&s;gui&s;e or palliate the ba&s;ene&s;s of this de&s;ign, &s;o effectually had he prepared the mind of Raymond for its reception, by rai&s;ing the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ions to darken and confound his rea&s;on. This Lord at once re&s;igned him&s;elf to the guidance of his minion, and con&s;ented to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as he &s;hould dictate. The Monk was now &s;ummoned before him, and appeared in the mo&s;t abject aba&s;e|ment and &s;ervility. Raymond thanked him for his zeal, promi&s;ed to repay his &s;ervices, and ordered him to ob&s;erve exactly the directions of his brother. Re|ginhald bowed lowly, and attempted to &s;peak his duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but in di&s;ordered and ungraceful lan|guage; then retired with Grey.</P>
<P>The&s;e wicked agents, thus inve&s;ted with full au|thority, and prompted by their hopes of intere&s;t and &s;avour, vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued the work of oppre&s;&s;ion and
<PB N="112" REF="19">deceit. Reginhald repaired to his mona&s;tery (&s;o was he directed by his brother) where he urged the fathers to proceed, without delay, in their ob&s;equies to the decea&s;ed Lord, as his widow now prepared, and had appointed a day for her &s;ecend nuptials, which were only delayed, 'till the&s;e religious rites had fir&s;t been duely performed. The reverend clerks were arrayed in their &s;acred ve&s;tments, and chaunted forth the &s;o|lemn requiem. The neighbouring pea&s;ants caught the religious &s;ounds, curiou&s;ly enquired the cau&s;e of the&s;e extraordinary devotions, and &s;pread the tidings of the intended marriage thro' the adjacent country. In the mean time, the attendants and dome&s;tics of Raymond were taught to expect the nuptials of their Lord on a day a&s;&s;igned, and ordered to hold them rea|dy for this joyful event. The found of bu&s;y prepara|tion was loud thro' all the ca&s;tle, and was heard even to the apartment of the Counte&s;s, who wondered, enquired, and was not long a &s;tranger to the cau&s;e. She conceived it to be no other than an artifice of her importunate wooer, to deceive the friends of her hou&s;e, and to de&s;troy the credit of O&s;wald, her faith|ful emi&s;&s;ary (of who&s;e confinement &s;he was yet unin|formed.) With &s;corn and indignation &s;he reflected on the ba&s;e attempt to &s;ully her bright fame, and to per|&s;uade her friends, that, in defiance of the &s;trict re|&s;traints of decent widowhood, and the re&s;pect which the memory of a noble hu&s;band claimed, &s;he had, within the &s;pace of a few months, li&s;tened to the &s;ollicitations of a new &s;uitor, and con&s;ented to receive the hand of her oppre&s;&s;or. If the honour and reve|rence with which &s;he reflected on Lord William had been &s;omewhat impaired by her &s;u&s;picions of his di&s;|loyalty, a new and more violent aver&s;ion to Lord Ray|mond now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her mind, and there &s;till kept up an inflexible re&s;olution never to acknowledge his pre|ten&s;ions to her inheritance, or to accept his love. In &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions &s;he received the vi&s;its of this Lord with di&s;dain, nor an&s;wered his tenders of affection, but by inveighing with all the bitterne&s;s of contempt and abhorrence again&s;t the mean deceit which he was
<PB N="113" REF="20">now practi&s;ing. Raymond was aba&s;hed: he could not deny the accu&s;ation, but, with an ill-affected open|ne&s;s, declared that he had indeed a&s;&s;ured his friends, that his wi&s;hes would be &s;peedily crowned, as he would not &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he could ever continue thus unrea&s;onably obdurate, and ob&s;tinately in&s;en&s;ible to her own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such were their interviews; and &s;uch the fixed a|ver&s;ion and proud di&s;dain of the Counte&s;s, un&s;ubdued by oppre&s;&s;ion, grief, and fear. Her tedious and me|lancholy hours were &s;till wa&s;ted in alarms for her &s;on, in anxious expectation of relief; of the arrival and vigorous interpo&s;ition of her friends, and of the de|feat and di&s;grace of her oppre&s;&s;or. In vain did &s;he ince&s;&s;antly enquire, complain, condemn the &s;low pro|cedure of tho&s;e who &s;hould fly to a&s;&s;ert her cau&s;e. No me&s;&s;enger of deliverance appeared, no voice of comfort did &s;he receive: but on the morning of that day, which Raymond had pre&s;umptuou&s;ly proclaimed his marriage-day, &s;he &s;till found her&s;elf the helple&s;s and joyle&s;s pri&s;oner of her fal&s;e gue&s;t.</P>

<P>RAYMOND, now on the point of executing his bold purpo&s;e, trembled with anxiety, doubt, and &s;ollicitude. Grey him&s;elf felt an inward agitati|on, although he laboured to encourage and confirm his Lord. The Monk alone &s;tood &s;tupidly in&s;en&s;ible of the importance or of the ba&s;ene&s;s of the de&s;ign. The attendants were di&s;po&s;ed in their appointed &s;tati|ons; and joy and fe&s;tivity &s;eemed prepared. The a|partments of the Counte&s;s alone were &s;ad and &s;olitary, where Elinor was &s;till &s;uffered to perform all kind offices to her afflicted Lady. At the appointed hour, Raymond appeared before her, and fir&s;t in gentle terms reproached her unkind coldne&s;s and &s;everity; but urged his love in a manner more bold and pe|remptory. She was &s;ilent: he renewed his in&s;tances: &s;he breathed a deep &s;igh, and looked up to heaven as
<PB N="114" REF="21">if complaining of her unmerited di&s;tre&s;s, her helple&s;s &s;tate, which expo&s;ed her to the&s;e in&s;olent and hateful &s;ollicitations. He &s;eized her hand; &s;he &s;truggled to di&s;engage her&s;elf, whil&s;t her eyes darted fiery di&s;dain. In that moment the brothers entered. At &s;ight of Reginhald &s;he &s;huddered with horror and di&s;may, though yet unacquainted with the purpo&s;e of his ap|pearance. A &s;olemn pau&s;e of &s;ilence en&s;ued; the Counte&s;s trembling; Raymond confounded; and the brothers, who could not behold this di&s;order without &s;ome faint emotion, collecting new force, and arm|ing them&s;elves again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of pity.</P>
<P>An encouraging glance from Grey, at length, em|boldened his Lord to break &s;ilence. He conjured the Counte&s;s by all her hopes of peace, all the tenderne&s;s &s;he felt for her darling &s;on, no longer to delay her own happine&s;s; no longer to continue thus perver&s;ely in&s;en|&s;ible of his ju&s;t preten&s;ions to her love. He now &s;tood before her, he declared, to claim tho&s;e rights which the royal favour had conferred upon him; that neither his honour nor his love, permitted him, any longer, to flatter her pride, or to indulge her weak &s;cruples.&mdash; She fell upon her knees, and began to utter-an ear|ne&s;t and pa&s;&s;ionate vow, that &s;he never would con&s;ent to accept his hand; but Raymond and his a&s;&s;ociates quickly interrupted and rai&s;ed her from the ground. Nor was her great &s;pirit yet &s;ubdued by this rude violence: &s;he turned upon them with looks of a&s;toni&s;h|ment and di&s;dain. Raymond entreated; Grey re|proved her pride; and Reginhald denounced the ven|geance of heaven again&s;t her ob&s;tinacy: whil&s;t the tender mind of Elinor, wounded deeply by the di&s;tre&s;s of her dear mi&s;tre&s;s, thus &s;urrounded with cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, ea&s;ed it&s;elf in unavailing tears. Raymond &s;till held the hand of Ela; and the impious Monk, who had waited for the &s;ignal from Grey, &s;uddenly began to pronounce the marriage rites; but was in|&s;tantly interrupted by loud and piercing &s;hrieks fre|quently and violently repeated both by the Counte&s;s and her attendant. The unhappy Lady could not
<PB N="115" REF="22">long &s;upport this violent emotion; &s;he &s;unk down up|on her couch; and Raymond hung over her with a mixture of tenderne&s;s and vexation. After a long in|terval of faint and breathle&s;s depre&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;eemed to revive, and prepared to &s;peak. Reginhald &s;eized the moment of her recovery, and again began the holy office.&mdash;But in that in&s;tant a new and unexpect|ed interruption checked his profane purpo&s;e, and con|founded the ba&s;e attempt of u&s;urpation and cruel op|pre&s;&s;ion. The &s;ound of ha&s;te and trepidation &s;eemed to approach the chamber. Raymond &s;tarted! the brothers &s;hook at the alarm; a voice was heard cal|ling loudly on Grey. He i&s;&s;ued forth; Raymond and the Monk followed: they &s;aw a dome&s;tic pale and breathle&s;s with ha&s;te, who ju&s;t found words to de|clare that Lord William was on his way, and would &s;peedily reach the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Not the condemned criminal when he receives his final &s;entence; not the &s;inner, yet unconfirmed in guilt, when the &s;udden cra&s;h of thunder appalls his &s;pirit, ever &s;hrunk into &s;uch abject con&s;ternation, as Ray|mond now experienced from this &s;hocking intelligence. Grey was &s;carcely le&s;s confounded, although he fear|ed only for his &s;afety, and had no &s;en&s;e of wounded honour. They ha&s;tened into an adjacent apartment, where Reginhald alone was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to examine this me&s;&s;enger of terror; who informed them, that his appointed duty had led him to &s;ome di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle, where he had di&s;covered a &s;mall company of travellers, who, on his nearer ap|proach, appeared in di&s;order and perplexity: that they had demanded his condition and place of re&s;i|dence, and on their part informed him, that they were the attendants and me&s;&s;engers of Lord William, who had landed on the coa&s;t of Cornwall, and was &s;oon to re&s;ume the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ca&s;tle: the infor|mation they had receive on their way of the nuptials of the Counte&s;s had filled them with con&s;ternation; three of them had re&s;olved to return and convey this intelligence to their Lord, whil&s;t an equal number
<PB N="116" REF="23">now ha&s;tened forward, if po&s;&s;ible to prevent &s;o fata a purpo&s;e.&mdash;'Behold!' &s;aid he, pointing down|wards from the window which commanded a &s;ull view of the ca&s;tle-gates, <Q>their &s;peed hath equalled mine, and they are now entering.</Q>&mdash;Grey ru&s;hed out, and ordered the dome&s;tic to follow. He received the un|welcome gue&s;ts with an appearance of re&s;pect. They were conducted to an apartment, and entertained with due courte&s;y by the man who had brought the news of their arrival, and who now had &s;trict charge, that for a while they &s;hould be kept from any inter|cour&s;e or conference with the other attendants.</P>
<P>A &s;mall ray of hope &s;eemed to dart through the gloom which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind of Grey, when he found that Lord William him&s;elf was not yet ar|rived. A little re&s;pite &s;eemed of moment, as it al|lowed him to reflect, and to concert his &s;uture mea|&s;ures. At fir&s;t, he thought of abandoning his Lord, and &s;ecuring him&s;elf by flight; but although Ray|mond &s;hould not be able to revenge &s;uch de&s;ertion, the power and re&s;entment of Lord Hubert were terri|ble, and could not fail to de&s;troy him. Gay hopes of &s;haring in the riches of this great hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury, had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his imagination; and he now felt the mo&s;t implacable hatred of the man who was ap|proaching to defeat the&s;e gay hopes. His malice and his fears con&s;pired to recommend the mo&s;t de&s;perate cour&s;e of action. He re&s;olved to make one daring ef|fort more, and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till to e&s;tabli&s;h the pre|ten&s;ions of his ma&s;ter, and to remove his rival by a bold a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>In &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions did this wicked minion return to his Lord. He found him &s;unk in de&s;pair, and tor|tured with di&s;traction. Scarcely had he begun to &s;peak, when Raymond, &s;tarting up in frantic emoti|on, &s;eized upon him with dreadful menaces of ven|geance, as the treacherous murderer of his honour and his peace; and cur&s;t him&s;elf and his vile &s;educer in all the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e. Reginhald fled, and &s;ought to hide him&s;elf from the terror of his re&s;ent|ment.
<PB N="117" REF="24">Grey, without the lea&s;t expo&s;tulation, the lea&s;t attempt to allay the fury of his Lord, &s;uffered the violence of pa&s;&s;ion to take its free cour&s;e, and to wa&s;te its force in fruitle&s;s execrations. And &s;oon was the &s;torm allayed; and Raymond as if recovering from a &s;udden phrenzy, &s;oftened into grief and tender|ne&s;s condemned his own extravagance, and entreat|ed his favourite to advi&s;e, direct, and extricate him from this difficult and dangerous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Grey neither endeavoured to palliate the di&s;grace, nor to le&s;&s;en the danger, which his lord dreaded. He ob&s;erved that Raymond had indeed proceeded &s;o far as to leave no doubt that he had di&s;regarded the con|ditions impo&s;ed by the King, and had attempted the mo&s;t lawle&s;s acts of oppre&s;&s;ion. His own part in the&s;e tran&s;actions he repre&s;ented as the effects of his un|bounded zeal for the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter; a zeal which threatened to involve him in the fatal con&s;e|quences of an injured hu&s;band's vengeance. Such di&s;cour&s;e only &s;erved to irritate the pain which Ray|mond felt. 'Is there no way to retreat with ho|nour?' cried he, 'no! nor with &s;afety,' returned his minion, <Q>Let us not think of retreat. We are engaged, and mu&s;t pur&s;ue our purpo&s;e. You won|der; but the way is obvious, and there is but one way. Perhaps this hu&s;band comes but &s;lightly at|tended: you have Knights and men of arms. Nay, &s;tart not. Shall we tamely hold our throats, and re|ceive death from him? No; this arm &s;hall prevent the blow.</Q>&mdash;Raymond had long been accu&s;tomed to re&s;ign him&s;elf to the guidance of this favourite: by him he had been gradually led on from one exce&s;s to the other; and &s;o thoroughly was his mind prepared to receive the very wor&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, (&s;uch is the fatal con&s;equence of the fir&s;t deviation from virtue) that, in&s;tead of trembling at this la&s;t propo&s;al, he &s;eemed only &s;ollicitous to know the &s;ure&s;t means of effecting it.&mdash;And, here again, the favourite a&s;&s;umed that &s;uperiority which the pliant temper of his Lord, and an intimate acquaintance with his weakne&s;s and unju&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="25">de&s;igns had given him. He de&s;ired that all future mea&s;ures &s;hould be entru&s;ted to him; that from him the attendants &s;hould be directed to receive their or|ders. Raymond acquie&s;ced, yet not without the ut|mo&s;t anxiety, and mo&s;t melancholy pre&s;ages. His re|tirement was di&s;turbed and painful: all the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle plainly perceived that &s;omething extraor|dinary had occured; &s;omething to di&s;order their Lord, and to perplex his de&s;igns. The Counte&s;s alone felt &s;ome degree of comfort: &s;he fondly imputed the &s;ud|den retreat of her per&s;ecutors to &s;ome happy event which the flight of O&s;wald had produced, &s;ome ap|pearance of her friends, or &s;ome accounts of their motions. Hence was her hara&s;&s;ed mind enabled to recover from the violent &s;hock which it had ju&s;t now received.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the vigilant and crafty Grey, once more, &s;ought the me&s;&s;engers of Earl William, who by this time were much alarmed at the manner of their reception. He met them with courteous looks, and declared, that the Counte&s;s, who was now ill at ea&s;e, and could not admit them to her pre&s;ence, had &s;ent to inform her&s;elf particularly of the intelli|gence which they brought. They related briefly the landing of William, the place of his pre&s;ent re&s;i|dence, and his intention of &s;peedily returning to his own ca&s;tle. Grey received the account with coldne&s;s and affected diffidence: he ob&s;erved, that <Q>the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances had been received that Earl Wil|liam had peri&s;hed in France; that, if he really was approaching he mu&s;t be received with due re&s;pect: but, if envy or malice &s;ought to di&s;turb the ap|proaching happine&s;s of Lord Raymond by fal&s;e in|telligence, his power was great, and his re&s;entment would be violent. By his directions, they were for a &s;hort time to be &s;trictly guarded, le&s;t they &s;hould alarm the minds of his friends by rumours which might po&s;&s;ibly prove groundle&s;s; if otherwi&s;e, a few days would relea&s;e them.</Q>&mdash;They gazed upon each other with &s;urpri&s;e, but it was in vain to expo&s;tulate;
<PB N="119" REF="26">they appealed to time to confirm the truth of their de|clarations: and Grey then proceeded to &s;ummon &s;ome of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t zealous of the attendants on Raymond, who were conducted to their Lord, and by him commanded to receive their orders from his favourite, and implicitly to follow his direction.</P>
<P>The&s;e commands Grey pretended to explain more fully. He told them, that, from advices lately receiv|ed, their Lord had good rea&s;on to apprehend a fal&s;e de&s;ign to drive him from tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which he &s;o ju&s;tly claimed, and from whence alone he hoped to derive the power of rewarding his faithful follow|ers; that they were to arm them&s;elves with &s;peed, and carefully to guard all the approaches to the ca&s;tle, again&s;t force or treachery. Nor were they &s;low to ex|pre&s;s their zeal and chear&s;ul obedience. And now this wicked minion &s;tood prepared at the head of a re&s;olute and well appointed band, to oppo&s;e the en|trance of Lord William, and to plunge a dagger in his heart.</P>
<P>Long they waited in anxious expectation of their invaders, but in vain; no invaders appeared, no dan|ger threatened them. Grey began indeed to hope that the&s;e &s;trangers had been employed to deceive them, and to rai&s;e the&s;e fal&s;e alarms for &s;ome purpo&s;e yet undi&s;covered; perhaps by &s;ome friends of the Counte&s;s, who had learned or &s;u&s;pected her pre&s;ent condition. He vi&s;ited the me&s;&s;engers frequently, in|&s;ulted them on the appearance of fal&s;ehood which their intelligence now &s;eemed to wear; menaced, and endeavoured to terrify them into a confe&s;&s;ion of the real purpo&s;e of their coming. They &s;teadily adhered to their former declarations, and related &s;uch circum|&s;tances of the fortunes, the dangers, and the arrival of Lord William on the coa&s;t of England, as but too plainly demon&s;trated their truth and integrity. Grey was convinced, but di&s;&s;embled his conviction. He waited impatiently for the approach of the Earl, but no intelligence could be received: no unu&s;ual appea|rance, no arrival of &s;trange and unexpected vi&s;itants,
<PB N="120" REF="27">had broke in upon the &s;ilence and tranquillity of the adjacent lands. The di&s;appointment &s;erved but the more to perplex and alarm him: his vigilance was not relaxed; he kept his force collected about him, and &s;till &s;tood re&s;olved to meet his danger, and confirmed in his bloody purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>THE three faithful followers of Earl WILLIAM who had determined to return to their Lord, found him ju&s;t i&s;&s;uing forth from the hall of Ran|dolph, at the head of a &s;mall body of attendants. At &s;ight of them his mind was &s;illed with &s;ad pre&s;a|ges. He turned upon his ancient friend with &s;ur|prize: then both ru&s;hed forward, impatient to learn the cau&s;e of this unexpected return; and in&s;tantly received the melancholy tidings, that whil&s;t their companions had brought the news of the Earl's arri|val to the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury, they had returned to acquaint him, that the Counte&s;s had given her hand to Raymond, and that his nuptials had been &s;olemni|zed on the very day of their approach.</P>
<P>The bitterne&s;s of this intelligence was too great e|ven for the great &s;oul of WILLIAM. He &s;unk into a &s;ilent di&s;may, and &s;eemed unwilling or unable to contend with de&s;pair. The Knight, who&s;e &s;u&s;pect|ing thoughts had been prepared for this account, &s;trove to rou&s;e and comfort him, but a long time were his efforts fruitle&s;s. The afflicted Lord &s;carcely forced out, at long and heavy intervals, &s;ome broken &s;ighs, &s;ome confu&s;ed and imperfect expre&s;&s;ions, of angui&s;h, of re&s;entment, at the &s;uppo&s;ed unkindne&s;s of his wife, and the weakne&s;s and unworthine&s;s of her fatal com|pliance. At length, &s;uddenly &s;tarting from this extreme of depre&s;&s;ion to that of the mo&s;t violent fury, he ut|tered dreadful denunciations of vengeance again&s;t the de&s;troyer of his peace, and called on his friends to at|tend him in&s;tantly to his ca&s;tle, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in a brave and jo&s;t revenge. But here the caution of the
<PB N="122" REF="29">old Knight interpo&s;ed, and with difficulty prevailed on him to return to his friendly roof, and there to con&s;ult maturely upon the mo&s;t prudent mea&s;ures. The Earl obeyed, yet &s;eemed intent only on the mo&s;t violent and daring cour&s;e. In vain did Randolph remind him of the in&s;ufficient numbers of his retinue, and the &s;u|perior advantages of the u&s;urper. The &s;torm of pa&s;|&s;ion was &s;till loud and terrible; nor could the Earl lif|ten to danger or difficulty: the injuries which his honour had &s;u&s;tained were the &s;ole object of his thoughts, and revenge his &s;ole purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The fair Jacqueline &s;oon perceived a confu&s;ion and di&s;order ari&s;ing from &s;ome unexpected incident; and, impatient to learn the cau&s;e, appeared before her ho&s;t and her protector. Randolph acco&s;ted and entreated her to unite her gentle per&s;ua&s;ion, and to prevent Lord William from ru&s;hing precipitately on ruin. 'No!' cried the Earl, ha&s;tily interrupting him, <Q>the attempt is not ra&s;h, nor the purpo&s;e de&s;perate. What tho' my wife hath &s;o &s;oon forgotten me? What tho' the ab|&s;ence of a few months was too great for her impati|ence? What tho' &s;he hath accepted a &s;econd hu&s;band? Have my numerous dependents too been fal&s;e? Have they forgotten me? No! let us collect them! let us fire their brave &s;pirits to revenge their injured Lord; and let his fury fall with its due force upon this adulterous pair.</Q>&mdash;Jacqueline &s;eemed lo&s;t in con&s;u&s;ion: Randolph again interpo&s;ed, and urged the danger of venturing, thus weakly attended, to &s;eek his va&s;&s;als, and openly to give defiance to Raymond. But now the noble maid recovered from her fir&s;t fur|pri&s;e, and her great &s;oul began to beam forth thro' all her virgin re&s;erve. <Q>Where is that power and influ|ence, &s;aid &s;he, in the court of England, which Lord William boa&s;ted? If his own wrongs cannot there find redre&s;s, if he mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the precarious chance of arms, in vain have I &s;ought relief in this &s;trange land; in vain have I indulged the plea&s;ing hopes of regaining my lo&s;t inheritance, and (if he &s;till &s;upports the mi&s;eries of oppre&s;&s;ion, my injured parent. Will not the king protect.&mdash;
<PB N="123" REF="30">He &s;hall give me ju&s;tice, cried William.</Q> <Q>This arm rai&s;ed him to the throne: this arm can tear him from it.</Q> Then embracing her with a paternal &s;ond|ne&s;s, 'The &s;pirit of thy brave father,' &s;aid he, <Q>dwells in thee. Yes, fair partner of my fortunes, the King &s;hall give me ju&s;tice. Let my wife, no, the wife of Raymond now, enjoy for a while her foul di&s;loyalty. My vengeance &s;hall be fir&s;t directed a gain&s;t the great author of my wrongs, the proud Hubert. In the face of his mi&s;guided Sovereign, before the gallant Nobles of England, will I pro|claim his ba&s;ene&s;s, and demand full redre&s;s. Let us ha&s;ten to the royal pre&s;ence: there &s;hall my friends croud round me, and my va&s;&s;als attend my orders.</Q></P>
<P>Randolph was plea&s;ed at this re&s;olution, which William con&s;idered as the mo&s;t honourable, but he as the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e. The time, the manner, and all the circum&s;tances of their departure were now &s;ettled with more temper and compo&s;ed deliberation. The Knight in&s;i&s;ted to accompany his noble friend, toge|ther with his band of followers: Jacqueline con&s;ent|ed &s;till to re&s;ide in Cornwall, until the Earl had ob|tained, fir&s;t, the &s;ull redre&s;s of his own injuries, and, then, the happy means of re&s;cuing her father, or of revenging his fate. The little troop was &s;oon prepar|ed to enter on their march, and &s;oon took their way with no ungallant &s;how. The mind of Lord Willi|am was &s;till gloomy and di&s;ordered. He thought on his wife: the tenderne&s;s of her former love, the noble nature which all hen actions had invariably di&s;played, recurred to his mind, but now &s;erved only to aggia|vate his de&s;pair. Her &s;trange and precipitate compli|ance with the de&s;ires of Raymond was perplexing: but to be &s;o &s;oon forgotten was tormenting: and ever and anon he unbo&s;omed his di&s;tracted thoughts to the friendly Knight.</P>
<P>'Fooli&s;h and wretched is the man' (thus would he exclaim) <Q>who builds his happine&s;s on the frail and in&s;table affection of woman. O my friend! how &s;ecurely did I conceive our loves to have been found|ed!
<PB N="124" REF="31">how firmly did her heart &s;eem linked to mine: Can I forget the time, when all the noble youth of England courted the &s;miles of the rich and beautiful heire&s;s of Earl Patrick, when her eyes marked me out as their mo&s;t worthy object, and her love graced my ri&s;ing fame? Can I forget the day when I was fir&s;t, publickly di&s;tingui&s;hed by her favour? The &s;o|lemn jou&s;ts were prepared: the Knights glittered in their pompous array: we were &s;urrounded with all the beauties of the land; but our thoughts and de&s;ires were fixed on Ela. How did I labour to engage her intention by my gorgeous entry? Well do I remember the device which then adorned my &s;hield, and which my youthful pride had dictated. It was an eagle towering in air, with his eyes fixed on the &s;un; and the&s;e words beneath; NOT AK|ROGANT BUT CONSCIOUS OF NOBLENESS. We traver&s;ed the li&s;ts in &s;olemn &s;tate; and each champi|on, as he pa&s;&s;ed, made low obei&s;ance towards the place where Ela &s;at; but each unnoticed, 'till, Wil|liam pacing proudly by, and paying the ju&s;t homage to her high beauty, &s;uddenly &s;he let fall the knot of ribbons which adorned her lovely arm. I &s;eized, ki&s;&s;ed, and fixed it in my cre&s;t: and on that day did my gallant deeds con&s;e&s;s my zeal to merit her high regards. Many a &s;pear was bravely &s;hivered: but, ere our appointed cour&s;es were fini&s;hed, a loud and &s;udden &s;hriek a&s;&s;ailed our affrighted ears: we turned and &s;aw the &s;caffold, where this fair dame was &s;eat|ed yielding to its load. I bur&s;t like lightning to her re&s;cue; and, amid&s;t all the officious and vigorous in|terpo&s;ition of the croud, which the dangerous in|cident had collected, this arm it was which &s;aved her&mdash;And did our loves decrea&s;e? Was my heart ever e&s;tranged? Was it one moment &s;educed to any other object?&mdash;And, yet, &s;o &s;oon to be forgotten! the fal&s;e tidings of my death &s;o eagerly received!</Q></P>
<P>Randolph was &s;tudious to divert him from this me|lancholy &s;ubject. Revenge, he knew, was grateful to the high foul of William; and he laboured to in&s;pire him with hopes of a brave revenge. He &s;poke of
<PB N="125" REF="32">the arts that had been u&s;ed to influence the weak|ne&s;s of widowed, unfriended, una&s;&s;i&s;ted woman; of the craft of Hubert, and his iniquitous abu&s;e of the royal favour. 'But now,' &s;aid he, <Q>the King &s;hall know this minion: he &s;hall know with what mali|cious purpo&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion and unju&s;tice his fal&s;e heart conceived, and his fal&s;e tongue uttered the ly|ing tale of Earl William's death; and &s;peedily &s;hall he execute the full vengeance due to the wounded honour of his brave kin&s;man.</Q>&mdash;With eyes darting indignation, and &s;ounds of di&s;dain, the Earl replied, that his own influence and reputation in England, his noble friends and numerous adherents, had made Kings; and that he relied on the&s;e much more than on the ju&s;tice of young Harry. 'Alas' &s;aid he, <Q>lit|tle can thy hone&s;t heart conceive of that cra&s;t and wily in&s;inuation with which this courtier hath wound him&s;elf to the heart of his ea&s;y Prince. He alone directs and commands him. The noble&s;t &s;pi|rits of England are in&s;olently &s;corned; and the re|mote&s;t corner of the realm feels his pernicious in|fluence.</Q> 'Good heaven,' cried Randolph (&s;till la|bouring to divert the Earl from the gloomy &s;ubject which lay deeply fixed in his mind, and was ever ready to rife and torment him) <Q>When &s;hall our di&s;|tracted country feel the ble&s;&s;ings of a wife and vir|tuous rule? &s;hall faction and tumult for ever di&s;turb the land, and forbid avarice and &s;lavi&s;h adulation for ever &s;urround the throne? Is the in&s;olence of ill|gotten power to know no controul? Sad and gloomy is the pro&s;pect!&mdash;And yet, the &s;pirits of my brave countrymen, tho' depre&s;&s;ed and overborne, are &s;till unbroken. They have already contended, and they may again contend for the great prize of freedom. Perhaps (and truly plea&s;ing it is to indulge that hope) England may yet experience &s;ome happy age, when wi&s;dom, and valour, and virtue &s;hall con&s;pire to ble&s;s and to exalt her. Some glorious Monarch may yet hold her imperial &s;ceptre, flouri&s;hing in all the pride of youth, loved and revered by his grate|ful people, and dreaded by the enemies of ju&s;tice
<PB N="126" REF="33">and his kingdom. Perhaps the pious care of &s;ome illu&s;trious parent may have formed his mind to all princely virtues; perhaps &s;ome noble friend of ex|alted merit and un&s;ullied integrity may have aided the glorious work. Wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice may guide his councils, and valour lead forth his victorious armies: the united voice of a happy people may ble&s;s him, and the united force of all his enemies may &s;ink before him. If heaven &s;hould be thus gracious to our country, could its tran&s;cendent fa|vour admit of any acce&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Yes! let the happi|ne&s;s, di&s;&s;u&s;ed from the throne, be reflected back on &s;uch a Monarch. Let him be amply rewarded, in a princely con&s;ort, fitted to grace his royal &s;eat, and relieve his generous cares.&mdash;Then let the ardent prayers of his people be accepted. Let the princely pair flouri&s;h, and very late pay the debt of nature: from heir to heir let their virtues be tran&s;|mitted; and immortal be the glories and ble&s;&s;ings of their reign!</Q></P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the good Knight was elevated and in|flamed by this idea of public &s;elicity, the mo&s;t exalted and compleat which his imagination could form: and William &s;eemed to forget his private grief, and to be wrapt in the &s;ame plea&s;ing dream. And now they ap|proached towards the city of Marlborough where Henry &s;till held his court. The di&s;tant view of this royal &s;eat rai&s;ed a violent agitation in the brea&s;t of Sali&s;bury. He was now on the point of breaking from his ob&s;curity, and once more &s;hining forth in his native &s;phere: and he &s;elt all the emotion of an high and noble mind, impatient of wrongs, ready to urge them boldly and re&s;olutely to &s;eek redre&s;s. He enter|ed the city, when &s;uddenly his &s;pirit was &s;till farther agitated by a &s;trange and unexpected encounter. A &s;mall, but gallant, troop approached him, headed by a youth of noble port. Their leader had already fixed his eyes upon him, with marks of wonder; and, &s;top|ing, as if deprived of all power of motion, pronounced the name of Sali&s;bury. William came forward with courtous demeanour, attentively &s;urveying the &s;tran|ger,
<PB N="127" REF="34">who at once ended his &s;u&s;pence, yet encrea&s;ed his wonder, by declaring him&s;elf the young Lord of Poictiers, that Chauvigny whom his genero&s;ity had re&s;tored to an injurious father. A &s;udden exclamation of &s;urprize bur&s;t from the Earl, and an interval of &s;ilence en&s;ued: at length he was enabled to exclaim &mdash;<Q>Good heavens! the &s;on of the oppre&s;&s;or and murderer of my friend:&mdash;And in England!&mdash;The father too, perhaps, is ready to in&s;uit our wrongs, and boa&s;t of his perfidious cruelty.'&mdash;With his a&s;hes' replied the youth, 'let his errors al&s;o lie buri|ed, Do&s;t thou love the good Les Roches? He is my friend and father: extend thy love to me, and &s;ay, ble&s;s me with the happy tidings, that the fair Jac|queline hath e&s;caped the &s;torm of contention and misfortune, and lives in &s;a&s;ety.'&mdash;Would to hea|ven!' cried the Earl, 'that her father were now in England, to embrace and ble&s;s her; to be witne&s;s of her noble nature, and to thank the faints for her pre&s;ervation.</Q>&mdash;The young Lord could no longer re&s;train his impatient ardour; they had both alighted, and he now ru&s;hed on Earl William, and clung round his neck, with all the extravagance of joy. 'What tho,' &s;aid he, <Q>the brave Les Roches be &s;till pur&s;ued by the &s;everity of fortune; he may be re&s;cued; he may be yet re&s;tored to honour and happine&s;s. Lord Wil|liam will not deny his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he will aid me with his power, whil&s;t I labour to re&s;tore him!</Q>&mdash; <Q>Now, cried the Earl, I am indeed thy friend.&mdash; But we are at the Engli&s;h court. Here mu&s;t I make a trial of my power. If the name of Sali&s;bury be not forgotten; if a few months of ob&s;curity have not totally effaced the remembrance of my birth, my actions, and my &s;ervices, I &s;hall yet obtain re|dre&s;s of my private wrongs; and, if he &s;till &s;ur|vives, I &s;hall relieve my friend.</Q></P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he ru&s;hed forward, with an a&s;pect of Fiery re&s;entment and indignation. Chauvigny turned back with his followers, and attended him, expecting &s;ome important di&s;covery, &s;ome explanation of what the Earl had ha&s;tily and ob&s;curely hinted. They &s;oon
<PB N="128" REF="35">reached the very centre of greatne&s;s and magnificence; and, now, the long lo&s;t Earl of Sali&s;bury once more appeared in becoming &s;tate amid&s;t the nobles of Eng|land, &s;hining like the great light of heaven when ju&s;t emerged from a dark and baleful eclip&s;e. His ancient friends embraced him; his peers crowded round him, impatient to learn the &s;tory of his wonderful delive|rance. Not &s;o the cra&s;ty Hubert; he heard of his arrival with terror, and beheld him with confu&s;ion and di&s;may. The young king ha&s;tened to congratu|late his noble kin&s;man, who &s;unk upon his knee, loudly calling for ju&s;tice and redre&s;s. Henry rai&s;ed him, and demanded the cau&s;e and purpo&s;e of his pe|tition. The Earl collected his great &s;pirit, and, with locks of terror and di&s;dain, pointed to Hubert, whil&s;t &s;ilence and &s;u&s;pence po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the croud of no|bles. 'Come forth,' &s;aid he, <Q>thou wicked author of my wrongs! come forth, and meet the venge|ance due to thy treachery.&mdash;Here &s;tands the wretched caitiff, (&s;uch this arm &s;hall prove him) who ba&s;ely &s;eized the fatal moment of my ab&s;ence to de&s;troy my peace and happine&s;s for ever. Bear witne&s;s for me, ye warlike Barons and Nobles of this land, with what zealous loyalty I laboured to &s;upport the cau&s;e of Henry, and to e&s;tabli&s;h our rightful King on that royal feat: for him and for our country have I encountered the toils and de&s;perate calamities of war, the fury of proud foes and formidable ho&s;ts, the rage of &s;torms and waves, and the dangers of the tempe&s;tuous ocean. Scarcely have the&s;e &s;hattered limbs &s;upported the painful ta&s;k of honour, and wonderful hath my deliverance been. And what is my recompence? Whil&s;t I fought in Ga&s;coigne, this pernicious courtier, who never experienced the hazards and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the field, never knew aught but the luxurious ea&s;e of a palace, contrived the ruin of the brave harra&s;&s;ed &s;oldier. He cho&s;e out his minion, his nephew, the unworthily ennobled Raymond: he filled the royal ears with fal&s;e and malicious tales of my death; he &s;ent his creature to &s;eize my ca&s;tle, my power,
<PB N="129" REF="36">and my extended domain; and to in&s;ult my unhap|py Counte&s;s with his adulterous love: he hath a|bu&s;ed her weakne&s;s; he hath deceived her credu|lity, or perhaps by force po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of her bed. I &s;eek not for reparation: my wrongs wi&s;t not admit of this; but I call for ju&s;t puni&s;hment, for vengeance due to that deadly wound my honour hath thus &s;u&s;tained. To the ju&s;tice of my liege Lord I fly,&mdash;to your royal ju&s;tice, rather than to the influence which Sali&s;bury &s;till maintains, and the power which he &s;till commands in England.</Q></P>
<P>Henry was embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;ordered by the bold|ne&s;s of this addre&s;s. The precipitation with which he had yielded to the de&s;ires of Hubert now appear|ed in the true light, and covered him with confu&s;i|on. He prepared to acco&s;t the Earl in &s;uch &s;oothing terms, as he could command in this di&s;order of his thoughts, when the favourite, ver&s;ed in all the re|fined arts of di&s;&s;imulation, ha&s;tily prevented him, and thus a&s;&s;umed the &s;emblance of a generous impatience of all cen&s;ure or &s;u&s;picion:</P>
<P><Q>That I rejoice at the happy arrival of Earl Wil|liam, the &s;aints are witne&s;&s;es: that I believed him dead &s;urely cannot be deemed a crime, when &s;uch repeated a&s;&s;urances were received, that he had &s;hared the fate of his unhappy countrymen. What though I too indulgently con&s;ented to the wi&s;hes of my nephew, and obtained him permi&s;&s;ion to woo the gentle Counte&s;s, whom all the land regarded as a widow? What force, what fraud, what injury was meditated? What inju&s;tice hath been committed? What vile di&s;hone&s;t purpo&s;es have been pur&s;ued, that vengeance is &s;o loudly denounced? The &s;oul of Raymond is noble, and his procedure hath been honourable. True, he &s;ought the Counte&s;s; he found her deep in &s;orrow; he indulged her &s;orrow; nor urged his pa&s;&s;ion with the importunity of vio|lent love. He waited, if, happily, time and his tender cares might move the Counte&s;s to li&s;ten to his &s;uit; but, thanks to the interpo&s;ing providence of heaven, his &s;uit could not prevail.&mdash;Go, Lord
<PB N="130" REF="37">William, repair to thy princely ca&s;tle: there thy wi&s;e waits to receive thee; there &s;halt thou find her una&s;&s;ailed and unpolluted. Go, and be happy; and, when thou reflecte&s;t on thine own credulity, learn to forgive tho&s;e who too ea&s;ily received the fal&s;e &s;tory of thy death.</Q></P>
<P>The Earl gazed in &s;ilence, doubting, yet willing to believe the&s;e happy tidings. Hubert repeated his a&s;&s;urances with an a&s;pect &s;teady and compo&s;ed. By 'my Holidame!' exclaimed the King, <Q>it rejoiceth us that Lord William hath now found his &s;u&s;pici|ons fal&s;e: not the unexpected deliverance and hap|py arrival of our noble con&s;in give us greater joy. But let us forget all jealou&s;ies, and depi&s;e all fal&s;e rumours.&mdash;Embrace, and forgive Lord Hubert, command our power, and enjoy the reward of thy gallant toils.</Q>&mdash;The courtiers echoed the &s;enti|ments of their prince, and William with a con&s;train|ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion gave his hand to Hubert: his noble friends were collected round him, and renewed their congratulations: the King by his care&s;&s;es &s;eemed willing to efface the remembrance of that ea&s;ine&s;s with which he had yielded to the de&s;ires of his &s;a|vourite, and this favourite, by an a&s;&s;umed affection and humblene&s;s of deportment, &s;ought to quench all remains of animo&s;ity in the mind of the injured Earl; but con&s;cious, of his own artifice and hypocri&s;y, he naturally &s;u&s;pected that readine&s;s of belief, with which Sali&s;bury &s;eemed to yield his declarations, as well as that &s;udden calm of peace and reconciliation, in which his fury &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;ide. He had in|jured, and therefore hated him: he had affirmed boldly to divert the pre&s;ent &s;torm; but, whether the Counte&s;s had already yielded to Raymond, or whether he had forcibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of her bed, as yet he knew not: and po&s;&s;ibly Lord William might detect his fal&s;hood, and return with double fury, to urge his wrongs, and &s;eek his ju&s;t vengeance. Such thoughts he revolved for a while in his bu&s;y mind; and then confirmed him&s;elf in the dreadful purpo&s;e of concealing his ba&s;ene&s;s, and providing
<PB N="131" REF="38">effectually for his &s;afety and power by the immediate de&s;truction of this Lord.</P>
<P>Far other thoughts now employed the Earl. He had by &s;low degrees, and by the repeated arts of refined and &s;teady hypocri&s;y, been wrought into a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that Hubert had declared the truth; that his me&s;&s;engers had been deceived; and that his wife &s;till pre&s;erved her loyalty: and he freely in|dulged the&s;e delightful thoughts, which naturally in|&s;pirited an enlivened joy and complacency. The gra|cious conde&s;cen&s;ions of the King he received with ju&s;t returns of duty; he &s;hared in the delight which his noble friends expre&s;&s;ed at their return; and, al|tho' he wondered, yet was he affected with due plea&s;ure, at the zeal and love which the young Lord of France di&s;covered, at that earne&s;tne&s;s of friend|&s;hip which &s;eemed &s;o kindly intere&s;ted in his &s;ortunes. But not the &s;plendour and plea&s;ures of a court, not the affection of friends, nor the &s;miles of royal fa|vour, could detain him in the city of Marlborough. He was impatient to &s;eek his own noble man&s;ion, and his attendants held them&s;elves in readine&s;s to accom|pany him. Without any delay, but what refre&s;hment nece&s;&s;arily demanded, he took a dutiful leave of the King; he received the repeated a&s;&s;urances of Hubert, that his nephew had already retired from the ca&s;tle, and that the Counte&s;s waited to embrace him with unabated love; and he departed at the head of his little troop, now reinforced by the followers of Lord Chauvigny, who declared his re&s;olution to attend the Earl of Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P>They took their way; and William, who had hi|therto been totally engaged by his own great affairs, was now more at ea&s;e, and more at lei&s;ure to recall the tender &s;entiments of friend&s;hip, and to think on the good Les Roches. 'Gentle Lord,' &s;aid he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to young Chauvigny, <Q>how have I de&s;erved this zealous attachment, the&s;e extraor|dinary in&s;tances of your affection? Say, what &s;ur|pri&s;ing events have brought thee hither? Say, how hath Les Roches merited tho&s;e tender names, I think
<PB N="132" REF="39">thou gaved&s;t him, of friend and father? What of his fortunes can&s;t thou inform me? If he indeed &s;ur|vives, where &s;hall I &s;eek him? How &s;hall I re&s;tore his daughter?</Q>&mdash;The mention of Jacqueline bright|ened the countenance of her lover with a momentary joy, which was in&s;tantly clouded, and with a &s;igh which awakened all the &s;ears of William, he exclaim|ed at the &s;everity with which fortune had pur&s;ued his generous friend. 'I &s;till hope,' &s;aid he, <Q>and on that hope re&s;ts all my comfort, that he is now in England, but whither driven, or where he may now lay his melancholy head, alas, I know not. It is my purpo&s;e to &s;eek him; and in this good pur|po&s;e Earl William &s;urely mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me.&mdash;Let me unfold the &s;tory of our fortunes, and no longer wonder to &s;ee Chauvigny in this land.</Q>&mdash;They rode &s;lowly on apart from their a&s;&s;ociates, all but the good old knight; and the Frenchman thus began.</P>

<P>HOW can I reflect on that credulity, with which my father yielded to the fal&s;e and ma|licious Renre&s;entations of Mal-leon, and that un|merited &s;everity with which he pur&s;ued our gene|rous friend? Peace and forgivene&s;s to his departed &s;pirit!&mdash;If thou ha&s;t already heard how the hunted fugitive ranged through the wild and de&s;art mountains, &s;pare me the odious recital: yes, thou mu&s;t have heard. Thy brave Countrymen, who long defended him, mu&s;t have at length found their Lord. Their valour only could have re&s;cued thee from the &s;nares of envy and cruelty. And, may due honour and reward attend that Fidelity, which guarded the unhappy devoted head of Les Roches! Long time they watched over him in his melancho|ly retreat: nor was it their want of vigilance, but his own ab&s;ence of thought and carele&s;s inattention to danger, which at la&s;t &s;eparated him from their protection.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="40">
It was on the morning of a night of broken and di&s;ordered &s;lumbers, that the unhappy Lord &s;tarted from his hard couch, full of inward grief, and a|gitation. The woody covert where he had &s;ought repo&s;e, at fir&s;t concealed his motions from the En|gli&s;hmen, who watched at &s;ome di&s;tance. In&s;en&s;i|bly was he led on, wrapt up in &s;ad and painful re|flection; and wandered &s;olitary down the winding path, which led from the mountain, was divided, and gradually lo&s;t in a vale incumbered with &s;hrubs and rocks, and watered by a re&s;ounding current. At length, he awakened as from a dream, &s;tared round on the awful pro&s;pect, and &s;ought to gain his companions. But, alas! he had wandered too far, and too incautiou&s;ly. Perplexed and confound|ed, encompa&s;&s;ed with &s;teep hills, which the luxu|riant hand of nature had cloathed with a wild mag|nificence of fore&s;t; and, ever and anon, diverted from his cour&s;e by the rocky fragments which the torrent &s;eemed to have wa&s;hed down into the val|ley; his eyes &s;earched in vain for the path which he had taken: he ha&s;ted on, and pau&s;ed by turns, without direction, nor totally free from terror; when &s;uddenly he de&s;cried a venerable per&s;onage, clad in the habit of au&s;tere piety, on which the &s;ilver beard de&s;cended from a grave and emaciated vi&s;age. The hermit advanced, rai&s;ing his &s;hrivelled hands in holy benediction over our a&s;toni&s;hed friend; and, as Les Roches bowed before him, he enquired with &s;urprize what fate or chance had led him into this rude and &s;olitary retreat.</P>
<P>The afflicted Lord, awed by his reverend a&s;pect, yet comforted by that benevolence which beamed forth from his looks, and &s;oftened all his accents, freely acknowledged that he was the wretched child of calamity, driven to the de&s;art by per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion; and that he &s;ought the neighbour|ing hills, where a few friends, the two &s;harers in his misfortune, waited his return. The reverend father, who &s;aw his angui&s;h, comforted, exhorted,
<PB N="134" REF="41">and by degrees &s;o far gained on his confidence, that he freely acknowledged his name and quality, and briefly related the events which had driven him from the &s;ociety of men. The hermit was moved, and, pointing to his cell, which lay at no great di&s;tance, There, &s;aid he, &s;halt thou find re|fuge, 'till the&s;e &s;torms of calamity have wa&s;ted their violence. Come, on, my &s;on, enter and partake of my homely refre&s;hment: your friends too &s;hall be my care. Tarry there: I know all the wind|ings and &s;ecret paths of the&s;e unfrequented hills; I &s;hall &s;oon find them: and here &s;hall they enjoy a more &s;ecure, and, perhaps, le&s;s uncomfortable re|treat. The Baron made obei&s;ance, and accept|ed the generous invitation. The hermit laboured up the precipice with &s;low and painful &s;teps, to|wards the place which Les Roches had de&s;cribed; but here he found no unhappy &s;trangers: all was &s;ilence and &s;olitude. He returned full of fears and &s;ad forebodings, which his tenderne&s;s of nature had dictated. He entered his cave, but this too was &s;ilent and &s;olitary: no gue&s;t appeared; no afflicted Lord waited his arrival.</P>
<P>However cautiou&s;ly Les Roches had directed his cour&s;e, however &s;ecret and retired he had cho&s;en his re&s;idence, &s;till had his motions been long watch|ed by &s;ome ba&s;e and ignoble men, allured by the rewards promi&s;ed to tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;cover and &s;eize him. Four &s;ordid hinds, di&s;gui&s;ed in the garb of wood men, had diligently traced him thro' all his various progre&s;s, but &s;till were terrified and kept at wary di&s;tance by the vigilance and well known valour of his attendants. The moment of his &s;eparation had not e&s;caped them: they exulted, and re&s;olved to &s;eize this critical occa&s;ion. They pur&s;ued his &s;teps, and ha&s;tened down to the valley by different routs to them well known.&mdash;They lay unnoticed, impatient to &s;natch their prey: they marked the late conference, and &s;aw the hermit depart; and no &s;ooner was he lo&s;t in the di&s;tant wood, than ru&s;hing furiou&s;ly into the cave, and
<PB N="135" REF="42">drawing their concealed weapons, they &s;eized the unhappy Lord unprepared for re&s;i&s;tance. In vain did he enquire the cau&s;e, and endeavour to expo&s;|tulate: they &s;ternly commanded him to attend their plea&s;ure, and hurrying him precipitately away, directed their cour&s;e towards the ca&s;tle of Poictiers, filled with the delightful idea of tho&s;e rewards they were to receive for a &s;ervice &s;o important. Their victim attended them, patient and re&s;igned to their in&s;olence, di&s;daining all entreaties and complaints; and was at length conducted into our hall, as a man indifferent to his fate, and prepared boldly to meet the wor&s;t that oppre&s;&s;ion could inflict.</P>
<P>But here he found a &s;trange and unlooked for reception; and all the &s;anguine hopes of his &s;ordid hunters were lo&s;t in confu&s;ion and di&s;grace. For|tunately &s;ome followers of Les Roches, who had been made pri&s;oners, and were examined by my fa|ther, di&s;tinctly recounted the events in the I&s;le of Rh&egrave;, and fired his brave &s;pirit with indignation and contempt for the Count Mal-leon. He began to lament the precipitate and mi&s;guided &s;everity with which he had pur&s;ued our friend, and to revere the character of Lord Sali&s;bury. In that moment he received the account of my flight, with true pater|nal grief and anxiety. His joy at my &s;peedy re|turn was equally extravagant; and &s;oon was he in|formed of the genero&s;ity that re&s;tored me to his arms. Alas! the&s;e violent and repeated impre&s;&s;ions were too great for his weak and di&s;ordered frame. He had long been oppre&s;&s;ed by a dangerous mala|dy, which, as it had inflamed and irritated his &s;pirit to an unu&s;ual degree of impatience and fret|ful violence, &s;o was it, in return, inflamed and ir|ritated by the events which this violence had pro|duced. Too late did he lament his fatal ra&s;hne&s;s, and utter his ineffectual wi&s;hes to make a full atone|ment. On the very morning when Les Roches arriv|ed at Poictiers, we were alarmed with the &s;ymptoms of his di&s;&s;olution, and in the&s;e arms did he expire.</P>
<P>Too intent on paying the mournful offices of my
<PB N="136" REF="43">decea&s;ed parent, I could &s;carcely give a thought to Les Roches; I had ju&s;t the power to i&s;&s;ue my com|mand that he &s;hould be treated nobly. Thus did he continue for &s;ome time a pri&s;oner, unnoticed, and uncertain of his fate: an interval which we after|wards lamented bitterly. To that we imputed the lo&s;s of Jacqueline; to that, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Lord William; which our imaginations repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t frightful form, all derived from my unhappy delay in &s;eeking and offering him protection. At length the remains of Lord Chauvigny were inter|red with all &s;olemn rites befitting his exalted condi|tion. I now became Lord of his power and domain, and &s;oon found lei&s;ure to think on the father of my beloved Jacqueline. The hinds who had made him my pri&s;oner, and now applied for their reward, faw me fall at his feet and embrace him, with all the rap|ture of affection and reverence. They would gladly have a merit of pre&s;erving and conveying him to my ca&s;tle: nor &s;hould I have denied their reward, but that their rude in&s;olence had aggravated the di&s;tre&s;|&s;es of my friend. I in&s;tantly pronounced him free; I vowed to devote all my influence and power, to make atonement for his unmerited &s;ufferings; to exert the mo&s;t zealous efforts of love and friend&s;hip to regain his daughter and to relieve Lord Sali&s;bury. But Les Roches was indeed re-in&s;tated in full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his lands and ca&s;tle: but, not all our mo&s;t diligent enquiries, not all our vigilance and labour, in traver&s;ing the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t unfrequented parts of our province, could obtain the lea&s;t information of his daughter, or his friend; &s;o &s;ecretly had Sali&s;|bury cho&s;en his retreat: or perhaps he was then con|tending with &s;torms and waves: perhaps &s;ecurely landed on his own native &s;hore. This la&s;t thought was plea&s;ing, and we were inclined to indulge it.&mdash; Thus while my brea&s;t was filled with all the impa|tience of love, and paternal fondne&s;s equally predo|minant in Les Roches, we &s;oon concurred in the adventurous re&s;olution of &s;eeking the dear trea&s;ure in England, which fortune had &s;o unkindly torn
<PB N="137" REF="44">from us. Thither, &s;aid we, hath Jacqueline been conducted by her noble protector, and there &s;hall we find both utterly de&s;pairing to regain Les Roches. Inflamed with &s;uch hopes, we in&s;tantly prepared our retinue, a gay and gallant train: we &s;oon reach|ed the coa&s;t, and &s;oon were we embarked: alas, too &s;oon! little &s;u&s;pecting the &s;evere rever&s;e of fortune, that now threatned to confound all our flattering expectations.&mdash;The &s;ea was rough and &s;tormy, our bark &s;tout and amply furni&s;hed, but our mariners were un&s;kilful; and long time did we contend with all the violence of the winds, and long time were we driven from our de&s;tined cour&s;e. And, when at la&s;t, after various dangers and difficulties, we were cheared with the hopes of &s;peedily gaining the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, &s;uddenly we found our&s;elves a&s;&s;ailed by a bold pira|tical ve&s;&s;el, and threatened with a &s;evere captivity. The ho&s;tile intentions of our adver&s;ary were but too plainly di&s;covered, as he bore down upon us. Our force was in&s;tantly collected, and we re&s;olved to de|fend our liberty with due &s;pirit. Tortured at the thought of being prevented from pur&s;uing my de|&s;ign, I raved in all the wildne&s;s of frenzy and de&s;|peration, which the good Les Roches endeavoured to re&s;train, him&s;elf equally re&s;olute, but in&s;pired with a more deliberate and rational courage. No &s;ooner had the enemy clo&s;ed with us, than this gal|lant Lord, earne&s;t to prevent me in the pur&s;uit of danger, leaped on board his ve&s;&s;el, was followed by a few attendants, and there maintained a bloody and unequal conflict. We pre&s;t forward, earne&s;t to &s;econd this bold attack; the pirate was alarmed at our numbers and our re&s;olution, when, &s;uddenly, the violence of the &s;urge &s;eparated our ve&s;&s;els; and as we endeavoured to regain our former &s;tation, anxious for the re&s;cue of our companions, we were &s;hocked with the view of the pirate flying before us. His ve&s;&s;el was of quicker &s;ail, and his mariners more expert. He left us in rage and angui&s;h, utter|ing fruitle&s;s execrations, and &s;training our limbs in fruitle&s;s efforts to regain our captive friends. In the
<PB N="138" REF="45">bitterne&s;s of grief and di&s;appointment, I re&s;olved to continue the pur&s;uit, if happily &s;ome favourable incident might bring the enemy once more into our reach; and for a while the pur&s;uit was continued. But the &s;torm was loud, and my followers too &s;en&s;i|ble of their danger. They forced me to make to|wards land; and, after much hazard and difficulty, we were at length di&s;embarked on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of England.&mdash;We recounted our late adventure to the inhabitants of the coa&s;t, who well knew the pi|rate we de&s;cribed, and had oftentimes &s;uffered by his depredations. They informed us that his name was William de Mori&s;co, a bold adventurer, who had of late frequently infe&s;ted their dwellings, and probably, ere long, might alarm them by another de&s;cent: that his exactions had ever been &s;evere, but that his nature, rude as it was, di&s;covered no wanton cruelty, no malicious thir&s;t for blood; that an honourable ran&s;om might prevail upon him to &s;et our friends at liberty. I was comforted by this intelligence, and waited for a time, in hopes of &s;ome favourable opportunity of recovering Les Roches: but no ve&s;&s;el appeared; no intelligence was received.</P>
<P>Unable to &s;upport this delay, I re&s;olved once more to &s;eek the enemy at &s;ea. My followers I knew would prove aver&s;e to &s;uch an attempt; and the occa&s;ion demanded more &s;kilful mariners, and a ve&s;&s;el more compleatly appointed than our's, which by this time had felt the &s;everity of winds and &s;eas. I therefore formed the bold de&s;ign of applying for a&s;&s;i&s;tance directly at the Engli&s;h court. A young King, jealous of his honour, could not be unmoved at the in&s;ults offered to his territory by this ob&s;cure adventurer: he mu&s;t readily fa|vour the generous purpo&s;e of pur&s;uing and engage|ing him: and, if Lord Sali&s;bury hath now regain|ed his native country, he cannot be le&s;s zealous to re&s;cue his friend; he mu&s;t effectually aid my endeavours.&mdash;Thus I rea&s;oned; and, leaving a part of my retinue on the coa&s;t to treat for the
<PB N="139" REF="46">ran&s;om of our friends,' if the pirate &s;hould appear, I proceeded to the court of England, where jou&s;ts and tournaments were prepared for the entertain|ment of the King, now recovering from a tedious &s;ickne&s;s. In the&s;e I engaged; nor was I di&s;graced, or my attendants unnoticed. Henry vouch&s;afed his attention to the &s;tranger, and received me with a princely welcome. I called my&s;elf a young Lord of one of tho&s;e provinces of France that acknow|ledged the Engli&s;h juri&s;diction; and declared the whole &s;tory of my adventure on the voyage to|wards England. The King was duly affected with indignation, commended the gallant re&s;olution I expre&s;&s;ed of &s;eeking the pirate, and readily pro|mi&s;ed to entru&s;t the cha&s;ti&s;ement of this in&s;olent plunderer to my command.</P>
<P>Lord Hubert, whom I &s;oon found to be princi|pal in the confidence of his ma&s;ter, echoed the &s;en|timents of Henry: he frequently held conver&s;e with me, and enquired much about the affairs of my province. Di&s;cour&s;e of the late wars naturally introduced the name of Sali&s;bury: I &s;ighed, and Hubert ha&s;tily demanded if I could &s;ay aught of the fortunes of this Lord. The melancholy air which I a&s;&s;umed, redoubled his attention: I told him that Lord William had landed in France, had been pur&s;ued by the fury of his unju&s;t enemies, fled with a noble maid who&s;e father had deeply &s;nared in his calamities; and, &s;ince he was not by this time returned to his native country, I &s;eared for both.&mdash;Hubert, with an impatience and violence to me unaccountable, ha&s;tily interrupted me, by declaring that William mu&s;t have peri&s;hed; and this was delivered in a tone and manner which indicated too plainly, that he felt a peculiar plea|fure in this per&s;ua&s;ion. I was alarmed; I cauti|ou&s;ly avoided all farther explanation, and coldly a&s;&s;ented to his opinion: but Hubert, naturally jealous, and practi&s;ed in the arts and policy of courts, &s;u&s;pected my &s;ilence. He was &s;en&s;ible that I had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome part of my &s;tory: he treated

<P>In a happy hour!' replied the Earl:&mdash;'but, gentle Lord, be not diverted from thy purpo&s;e: ha&s;te thou to the coa&s;t, I &s;hall but vi&s;it my ca&s;tle, and &s;traight follow thee, if happily we may yet recover our noble friend.

<P>CHAUVIGNY prepared to an&s;wer, when their conference was &s;uddenly interrupted by the ap|proach of a &s;tranger, who, with gentle a&s;pect and deportment, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Sali&s;bury, and kind|ly congratulated his &s;a&s;e return to England. The Earl beheld him with &s;urpri&s;e tempered with due courte&s;y, and, ere he could demand his name, the &s;tranger ob&s;erved with earne&s;tne&s;s that the dampy &s;hades of night were approaching fa&s;t; and pointing to a fair dwelling, which lay at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, invited the Lords to accept of re&s;idence and refre&s;h|ment under his roof, 'till morning. 'There,' &s;aid he, <Q>&s;hall your retinue be al&s;o entertained; and there &s;hall Lord William receive &s;ome plea&s;ing intelli|gence from the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury.</Q> Without farther he&s;itation or enquiry, the Earl joyfully aceepted
<PB N="141" REF="48">this invitation, and, pre&s;&s;ing forward as his ho&s;t di|rected, entered a goodly hall, which &s;eemed decked and prepared for his ho&s;pitable reception.</P>
<P>Little did this Lord conceive of the danger which now awaited him; of the de&s;perate purpo&s;es of Ray|mond and his a&s;&s;ociates, and the &s;ecret malignity of Hubert who for &s;ome time had entertained a de&s;ign again&s;t his life, and he&s;itated only about the mears of execution. Con&s;cious of the vengeance due to his own ba&s;ene&s;s and &s;al&s;ehood, and firmly determined to prevent it, he revolved many different &s;chemes of de|&s;troying Earl William either by force or fraud. In the mid&s;t of &s;uch bloody thoughts he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the arrival of a me&s;&s;enger from Lord Raymond, who de&s;ired a private conference: Raymond and his wick|ed minion had for &s;ome time been perplexed and con|founded. The intelligence of the three Engli&s;h men (whom they &s;till kept under re&s;traint) was clear and explicit: they adhered invariably to their fir&s;t ac|count, and frequently repeated their declarations with an ingenuous appearance of truth, wondering that their Lord was not yet arrived. On the other hand, Sali&s;bury did not appear; no farther intelligence was received, no di&s;coveries made by tho&s;e &s;ent out to watch his approach. In this &s;u&s;pence and uncertain|ty, Raymond, who&s;e mind was too violently agita|ted to &s;ugge&s;t any calm and deliberate coun&s;els, and Grey, who&s;e wiles &s;eemed to be at length exhau&s;ted, concurred in the expediency of di&s;patching an emi&s;|fary to Lord Hubert, to inform him of their &s;ituation, and to de&s;ire his direction. Reginhald was appoint|ed for this purpo&s;e, and recommended as a per&s;on in whom Hubert might confide. The Monk now ap|peared before him and delivered his letters; (having already received the dreadful intelligence that William was now &s;afe in the town of Marlborough.) The piercing eye of Hubert, long u&s;ed to &s;can the counte|nances of men, and there to read their thoughts, nar|rowly &s;urveyed the a&s;pect of Reginhald, and &s;ormed too ju&s;t conceptions of his temper and di&s;po&s;ition. He enquired particularly into the mea&s;ures his nephew
<PB N="142" REF="49">had pur&s;ued; and the Monk an&s;wered to his que&s;tions in &s;uch a manner, as admitted Hubert to a thorough knowledge of his wicked heart. Fully per&s;uaded that he now had a proper in&s;trument of his deadly purpo&s;e, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Monk for a while, and appointed an hour for a &s;econd conference.</P>
<P>The dark de&s;ign he now meditated required &s;till &s;ome farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A man there was at this time attendant on the court, whom the cra&s;ty mini&s;ter had frequently made the agent of his oppre&s;&s;ion and unju|&s;tice. He had often times &s;ent him out to harra&s;s the land by &s;evere and fraudulent exactions, and had &s;uf|fered him to be enriched by a &s;hare of the &s;poil. Tyrrel (&s;o was he named) lived but by the favour of Hubert, who re&s;erved him for his wicked purpo&s;es; yet might at once take away his life with a fair &s;em|blance of public ju&s;tice, &s;hould he at any time rebel again&s;t his &s;overeign plea&s;ure. This man was now &s;ummoned before him; and, with a brow of care and anxiety, as if &s;ome de&s;ign of moment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, Hubert commanded him in&s;tantly to repair to his hou&s;e, which lay near the road Lord William was to take; to invite this Lord; to entertain him with all no&s;pitable rites; and, in &s;ome other matters which &s;hould hereafter be explained more fully, to &s;ubmit entirely to the guidance of a Monk whom he &s;hould &s;peecily &s;end to him, and whom he was al&s;o to entertain. Tyrrel was alarmed at this my&s;terious language: he knew the de&s;perate unrelenting &s;pirit of his ma&s;ter, and &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome bloody de&s;ign was now to be executed; and that his hou&s;e was to be the fatal &s;cene of violence or treachery. He trem|bled and he&s;itated, for he was not yet con&s;ummate in villainy: but Hubert thundered in his ears the mo&s;t terrible denunciations of vengeance and utter de&s;truc|tion, &s;hould he betray the lea&s;t reluctance, the &s;mall|e&s;t defect of zeal and alacrity in executing his orders. Tyrrel bowed before him with a &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed full obedience.</P>
<P>Still he had to practice with Reginhald; but here he expected, and indeed found an ea&s;y ta&s;k. The
<PB N="143" REF="50">Monk was again &s;ummoned to his pre&s;ence. The di|&s;tinction and apparent confidence with which he was treated, &s;erved to intoxicate his ba&s;e mind, and to prepare him for &s;ome deed of violence or mi&s;chief: Hubert artfully commended his fidelity, and promi&s;ed to reward it, but lamented the danger in which Ray|mond and all his adherents were now to be involved. Lord William, he ob&s;erved, mu&s;t &s;oon reach his ca|&s;tle; the &s;hame of di&s;appointment and the violence of hatred and revenge mu&s;t &s;oon fall on Raymond; and the zeal of his faithful friends mu&s;t appear odious and criminal. Then, with well-affected perplexity and terror addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf earne&s;tly to the Monk, he de&s;ired his &s;age coun&s;el in this dangerous emergen|cy. Reginhald, with an awkward and abject aba&s;e|ment, declared that he was totally unable to advi&s;e, but ready to follow the directions of Lord Hubert with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ubtle courtier &s;eized him by the hand, applauded his zeal, and lavi&s;hed the ample&s;t promi&s;es upon him. 'Be bold,' &s;aid he, <Q>and be happy.&mdash;There is but one way&mdash;Let us pre|vent the attempts of our common enemy&mdash;by de|&s;troying him.</Q>&mdash;Reginhald took fire at this propo|fal: he at once freely offered him&s;elf to be the agent, and &s;eemed impatient to learn the means of executing a de&s;ign &s;o &s;uited to a heart that never felt humanity or remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Hubert ha&s;tily produced a phial filled with a dead|ly poi&s;on. 'Behold,' &s;aid he, <Q>the &s;ure means of de|&s;troying our enemy. Let it be thy care to pre&s;ent Lord William with this fatal draught, and name the reward of &s;o great a &s;ervice.</Q>&mdash;And now he pro|ceeded to explain his fell purpo&s;e to the Monk more particularly. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him fully in&s;tructed, and impatient for the execution. Reginhald was received by the abject creature of Hubert, and inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute authority over his dome&s;tics; Tyrrel watch|ed the approach of Lord William; this Lord accepted his in&s;idious invitation; and the Monk was brought before him, as a per&s;on from whom he was to receive &s;ome particular intelligence of his Counte&s;s. The
<PB N="144" REF="51">Earl was earne&s;t in his enquiries, and Reginhald prompt in his fal&s;e a&s;&s;urances. He declared (as he had been in&s;tructed by Hubert) that he had for &s;ome time re&s;ided in the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury, employed in admini|&s;tring &s;piritual con&s;olation to a dome&s;tic of the Coun|te&s;s; that he had frequently &s;een this Lady, been wit|ne&s;s of the melancholy of her widowed &s;tate, and of the affection with which &s;he cheri&s;hed the memory of her Lord. A &s;uitor indeed had vi&s;ited her; but &s;he had ob&s;tinately &s;hut her ears again&s;t all his &s;ollicitati|ons; and Lord Raymond was long &s;ince retired in de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tudied fal&s;ehoods had all the effect for which they were intended. The heart of William was dila|ted with joy: he embraced his friends with that warmth of affection which &s;udden good fortune natu|rally excites: then, turning again to Reginhald, re|peated his eager enquiries about his wife, his &s;on, his hou&s;e; and received &s;uch an&s;wers as confirmed his joy. He now &s;ecretly condemned his own ra&s;h &s;u&s;picions of the Counte&s;s; his love was redoubled; he was impa|tient to receive her in his arms; and all the lively im|pre&s;&s;ions of delight and &s;atisfaction which he felt were communicated to his friends. Chauvigny embraced him in joyful congratulation; Randolph forgot his &s;u&s;picions, and wore a face of &s;erenity and plea&s;ure. A generous repa&s;t was prepared, and the board was graced with the mo&s;t enlivened &s;ocial fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>The fal&s;e ho&s;t knew full well the dreadful purpo&s;e now to be executed, and dared not oppo&s;e, though he &s;huddered at the thought of it. To Reginhald he re&s;igned the ab&s;olute command of his dome&s;tics. The wicked Monk was officiou&s;ly attentive to oblige Lord Sali&s;bury; eager to promote the joy of the table, but le&s;s intent on &s;haring in this joy, than in providing for the gue&s;ts. He had now mixed the fatal draught, and &s;aw the poi&s;oned bowl in the hand of an attendant, ready to be delivered to Lord William. He &s;tood unnoticed in a di&s;tant part of the hall; his heart panting, his limbs trembling, and his haggard eyes fixed upon the Earl. He &s;aw
<PB N="145" REF="52">him receive the bowl; he retired towards the en|trance of the hall; he heard him &s;alute his ho&s;t and his a&s;&s;ociates; he turned, and &s;aw him rai&s;e the poi&s;on towards his head.&mdash;In that in&s;tant he ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly out, regardle&s;s of tho&s;e who were enter|ing with equal ha&s;te; mounted his hor&s;e, which &s;tood prepared by his appointment, and in an ex|travagance of horrid and malignant joy, fled to Lord Raymond with the important news that the Earl of Sali&s;bury was no more.</P>
<P>The joy of Raymond was extravagant. With eyes all on fire, and accents faltering with impati|ence and emotion, he demanded the particulars of this &s;urpri&s;ing intelligence; and the &s;hamele&s;s and abandoned wickedne&s;s of Reginhald &s;crupled not to declare the whole of his adventures &s;ince his late departure from the ca&s;tle. He was heard with ea|gerne&s;s and anxiety. At the mention of poi&s;on Raymond trembled; the blood for&s;ook his cheeks, and his brow be&s;poke horror and con&s;ternation: but Grey laboured to quiet his di&s;ordered &s;pirit, by ob|&s;erving, that he had taken no part in the deed; that it was pa&s;t and irrevocable; that now, he had but to con&s;ider how to approve this event to his own ad|vantage, to the intere&s;ts of his love and fortune. The wretch who hath once deviated from the paths of goodne&s;s, is ea&s;ily reconciled to the horrors of his progre&s;s in iniquity. The thoughts of this Lord were &s;oon turned to the flattering pro&s;pects of happine&s;s which were pre&s;ented to his imagination: his fir&s;t emotions of joy and triumph returned; he commended the zeal and daring &s;pirit of Reginhald; and Grey joined in the applau&s;e, although his wicked heart &s;ecretly repined at the &s;hare which his brother might now boa&s;t, in advancing the de&s;igns of Lord Raymond; and envied the va&s;t rewards which his &s;ervices might ju&s;tly claim.</P>
<P>Raymond was now &s;ully per&s;uaded that all his wi&s;hes were &s;peedily to be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; that future difficulties would gradually vani&s;h. In his pre&s;ent &s;tate of exultation he forgot the ob&s;tinacy
<PB N="146" REF="53">with which the Counte&s;s had hitherto oppo&s;ed his de&s;ires, and flattered him&s;elf with the hopes that a little time, together with a full and clear a&s;&s;urance of the death of Sali&s;bury, would prevail on her to li&s;ten more favourably to his &s;uit. For a while he re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend his &s;ollicitations; but, as the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s &s;erved to inflame his pa&s;&s;ion, he ob&s;tinately adhered to his re&s;olution of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the proud Lady, and even of recurring once more to violence, if vio|lence &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. With an affected lenity and genero&s;ity he ordered the three followers of Wil|liam to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, when he had fir&s;t &s;everely re|proved them, for pre&s;uming to di&s;turb the minds of his friends by fal&s;e intelligence. They returned to|wards the hou&s;e of Randolph, &s;till wondering at the delay of their Lord, and impatient to acquaint him with tho&s;e important tidings, which the unhap|py O&s;wald had found means of giving them in their confinement, notwith&s;tanding the vigilance of their guards.</P>
<P>Nor did the&s;e late extraordinary events, which had engaged all the attention of Raymond and his creatures, fail to excite the wonder and expectation of the Counte&s;s. They had &s;u&s;pended her per&s;ecu|tion, and now gave her lei&s;ure to indulge her hopes of relief and deliverance. Such hopes &s;he had not yet re&s;igned, though tormented by delay and painful di&s;appointment. Some fears indeed &s;ometimes aro&s;e, to cloud the plea&s;ing thoughts &s;he was &s;tudious to entertain: yet when &s;he reflected how abruptly Ray|mond had retreated from his wicked purpo&s;e of for|cibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of her bed, under the pre|tence of a nuptial ceremony; when &s;he con&s;idered the appearances of commotion and di&s;order which were evidently di&s;coverable in the ca&s;tle; &s;he &s;eemed to have good rea&s;ons to per&s;uade her&s;elf, that &s;ome intelligence mu&s;t have been received, equally favour|able to her, and confounding to her oppre&s;&s;or. She expected every moment to hear of the vigorous and effectual interpo&s;ition of &s;ome friends to affert the rights, and to redeem her from her pre&s;ent captivity;
<PB N="147" REF="54">yet did &s;he frequently lament to her faithful attendant, that her re&s;cue was &s;o long delayed. Whatever con|&s;olation Elinor could give, was now di&s;&s;embled and con&s;trained; for O&s;wald had been enabled to convey to his &s;i&s;ter an account of the &s;eizing of young William, and his own return and confinement. She was but too well acquainted with the violence of Ela, too much alarmed with the dread of her relap&s;ing into her for|mer malady, to entru&s;t this fatal intelligence to her ear. With a heart oppre&s;&s;ed with grief and terror, &s;he a&s;&s;umed the a&s;pect of ea&s;e and &s;erenity. When the Counte&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her fears, a &s;igh &s;ometimes e&s;caped from the attendant; but it &s;eemed the &s;igh of friendly &s;ympathy; and in her moments of plea|&s;ing thoughts, and expectations, Elinor had ever at command &s;ome general expre&s;&s;ions of comfort, &s;ome effu&s;&s;ions of pious confidence in the great protector of innocence, to brighten the dawn of hope which aro&s;e within her gentle mi&s;tre&s;s. But &s;he was &s;oon to be undeceived; too &s;oon was her heart to be pierced with the mo&s;t dreadful didings.</P>

<P>THE two brothers who had proved &s;uch zealous agents in oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, were once again to aggravate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Counte&s;s. The di&s;content and envy which Grey had conceived towards Reginhald &s;ince his la&s;t arrival, which he was not &s;tudious to conceal, together with the in&s;o|lence and pre&s;umption of this Monk, founded on the opinion of his great &s;ervices, produced mutual coldne&s;s and contempt in their wicked hearts, and threatened to di&s;&s;olve their iniquitous union. A new and unexpected incident now &s;erved to light up their animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Some enormities of Reginhald had lately been di&s;|covered in the mona&s;tery, too great to be concealed or palliated. A country maiden had been &s;educed to a compliance with his &s;en&s;ual de&s;ires. He had for &s;ome time con&s;orted with her, until by degrees his brutal pa&s;&s;ion grew &s;ated, and required &s;ome new object. He fixed his la&s;civious eyes upon the concu|bine of one of his a&s;&s;ociates in revelling, and made &s;ome attempts to po&s;&s;e&s;s her; which had provoked her paramour to utter the mo&s;t violent menaces again&s;t the Monk. To appea&s;e his re&s;entment, Re|ginhald ba&s;ely propo&s;ed to give him up the unhappy victim of his own lewdne&s;s. The man was not yet &s;o abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of virtue, as not to feel the utmo&s;t abhorrence at this in&s;tance of tran&s;cendent villany. Le&s;s &s;crupulous to acknowledge his own &s;hame, as he was not of the clerical order, and too violently provoked again&s;t the Monk to admit any thought of reconciliation, he only waited to procure
<PB N="149" REF="56">&s;uch proofs as might confirm his information; then &s;eized the moment of Reginhald's ab&s;ence, produced the wretched woman he had corrupted, as well as her he had attempted, and wounded the ears of the reverend fraternity with a full detection of their wicked brother: the whole cloi&s;ter was in&s;tantly filled with &s;orrow and indignation. Every in&s;tance of outrage and irreverence which he had committed was now recalled to mind, and repeated by every tongue. How often he had di&s;turbed or di&s;graced their religious hou&s;e, was now freely told; how often his inoffen&s;ive brethren had been expo&s;ed to his in&s;olence or malice; how often his bea&s;tly re|vels had been prolonged, until, rou&s;ed by the matin-bell, he had mixed his debauchery with their early devotions. It was at length re&s;olved to &s;end a deputation to the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury to de|mand that Reginhald &s;hould be &s;ent back to the mo|na&s;tery, there to here his accu&s;ers, and to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment due to his accumulated ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons entru&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion were now arrived. The Monk was made acquainted with the purpo&s;e of their coming, and affected to treat them with defiance and contempt, although he was too con&s;cious of his guilt not to feel the mo&s;t violent &s;ecret emotions of terror. He &s;ought his brother, and demanded his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this emer|gency. They cho&s;e for their private conference a garden belonging to the ca&s;tle, in which the Counte&s;s had chiefly delighted in her happier days, and which &s;he now &s;ometimes vi&s;ited, to refre&s;h her hara&s;&s;ed mind. Grey li&s;tened to the &s;tory of his brother's danger, with a provoking coldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility. Reginhald rudely vaunted his important &s;ervices to Hubert and Raymond, and &s;eemed to expect, as his ju&s;t right, their full protection in this his pre&s;ent difficulty. Grey at length broke &s;ilence by lament|ing this fatal di&s;covery, which he indu&s;triou&s;ly repre|&s;ented as in the highe&s;t degree dangerous and terrible. The Monk could &s;carcely re&s;train his impatience, at the affected air of &s;uperiority which his brother a&s;|&s;umed,
<PB N="150" REF="57">and the in&s;olence of reproof and cen&s;ure which his words conveyed. Grey, as if &s;till de|&s;irous to mortify him to the utmo&s;t, continued his di&s;cour&s;e by ob&s;erving with what zeal he had labour|ed to recommend a man to the notice of Lord Ray|mond, who, he feared, mu&s;t now appear, in the general eye, as unworthy of the favour of this Lord, and that he him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;hare in his di&s;grace. &mdash;'Dog!' exclaimed the Monk, flying furiou&s;ly upon his brother, who was alarmed, and retired from his violence, which he endeavoured to allay, by ha&s;tily promi&s;ing his friendly interpo&s;ition with Lord Raymond.&mdash;'Thy interpo&s;ition!' cried Regin|hald; <Q>Am I to depend on thee, thou caitiff? Is this my reward? Am I to &s;ue thee for the protection of thy great friends? Who was it that &s;aved them and their pernicious minion from di&s;grace and ruin? Thou, indeed, could'&s;t &s;teal away from &s;anctuary the infant heir of Sali&s;bury: but this was the daring hand which pre&s;ented the fatal draught to the father.</Q> &mdash;Here a loud and piercing &s;hriek broke off their di&s;cour&s;e. Ela and her kind attendant had taken their &s;eat unnoticed, in an adjoining bower, and heard the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations of the Monk. The emotions of the Counte&s;s was too great to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The brother &s;tarted, were confounded, and ha&s;tily &s;eparated; whil&s;t Elinor fled with frantic &s;peed to &s;ummon a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon conveyed to her chamber, and laid upon her couch, languid and &s;ilent. Elinor hung over her with &s;treaming eyes, and ever and anon en|treated her to give vent to her &s;orrows; but they were too great for utterance. Her eyes indeed were &s;ometimes rai&s;ed to heaven with all the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ilent mi&s;ery, and then, again, gently clo&s;ed, as if in|viting the kind and healing hand of death to cover them in eternal darkne&s;s. But no complaints did &s;he breathe, no exclamations of angui&s;h did &s;he utter. At length her frame &s;eemed convul&s;ed, and violently agitated: a torrent of tears poured down her lovely cheeks, and Elinor conceived &s;ome hopes that her
<PB N="151" REF="58">great &s;oul was now &s;truggling to &s;hake off the into|lerable weight of &s;orrow. But the calm which &s;uc|ceeded was the calm of in&s;en&s;ibility: &s;he gazed round her with a vacant eye, and all her noblene&s;s of na|ture &s;eemed irrecoverably lo&s;t in &s;en&s;ele&s;s melancholy.</P>
<P>The di&s;order of her apartment had reached the cars of Raymond, and, in the violence of &s;urpri&s;e and anxiety, he once again ru&s;hed into her pre|&s;ence. &mdash;With all the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e, he viewed the maje&s;tic ruins of exalted beauty and greatne&s;s, the fatal effect of his lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions. His haughty &s;oul melted into pity: he demanded the cau&s;e of her di&s;|order, and received from Elinor a di&s;tinct account of the horrid di&s;cour&s;e to which her unhappy Lady had been witne&s;s. All the train of dreadful pa&s;&s;ions that attend on detected guilt, tore the heart of Raymond with their united tortures. He &s;tarted, and wildly traver&s;ed the chamber: he pau&s;ed; bent his eyes again upon the Counte&s;s: then, turning &s;uddenly from the afflicting object, uttered terrible execrations upon him&s;elf and his vile &s;educers. He fell upon his knees, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Ela, as if &s;he were &s;en&s;ible of his di&s;cour&s;e, he pa&s;&s;ionately vowed to re&s;tore her &s;on to her arms, and in&s;tantly to abandon her ca&s;tle.&mdash;Again, ri&s;ing &s;uddenly, and i&s;&s;uing forth with wild precipitation, he called loudly for Grey; who appeared before him trembling, and, to pre|vent his rage, began with cur&s;ing the brutal violence of Reginhald.&mdash;'Bid my Knights prepare,' &s;aid Ray|mond; 'let my retinue &s;tand ready before the gates: &mdash;we mu&s;t depart.'&mdash;The countenance of his crea|ture expre&s;&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;&s;atisfaction.&mdash;<Q>No ex|po&s;tulation! none of thy damned arts!&mdash;Where ha&s;t thou be&s;towed the &s;on of this unhappy wo|man? See that he be in&s;tantly conveyed back to her ca&s;tle. Do it, &s;lave, or woe upon thy head! Ha&s;te!&mdash;an&s;wer me not.&mdash;Give out my orders for departure.</Q>&mdash;Then, once more entering the chamber of the Counte&s;s, with all the remor&s;e and angui&s;h of a man at length awakened to a &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="152" REF="59">his unju&s;t mi&s;guided conduct, when it was now too late to be corrected or repaired; he gazed di&s;tracted|ly upon her, and with a deep and di&s;mal groan pro|nounced a &s;olemn farewell. Then, turning quickly upon Elinor, who wept by his &s;ide: 'Speak to her,' &s;aid he; <Q>&s;he di&s;dains, and ju&s;tly, to hold conver&s;e with a villain. Say, that her per&s;ecution is now erded. Tell her I know not, I contrived not the murder of her hu&s;band. Let her pronounce his doom, and the officious &s;lave that acted the foul deed &s;hall die. Her &s;on lives, and &s;hall yet be happy in her embraces.&mdash;Hear me woman! Tell her I am gone: gone, never more to torment the weak unfriended, &s;olitary widow.&mdash;Yes! the&s;e cheeks are yet lovely; that form &s;till noble. But what of that? For me! for me could Heaven have re&s;erved &s;o rich a trea&s;ure? Horrid pre&s;umption!</Q> &mdash;Elinor kneeled before him, petitioned with all hu|mility for the enlargment of her brother, and that, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the nece&s;&s;ary attendance of the un|happy Counte&s;s, he might be ordered to re&s;ide for &s;ome time in the ca&s;tle.&mdash;'Cur&s;ed ca&s;tle!' cried Raymond; <Q>cur&s;ed be the hour in which I fir&s;t entered the&s;e fatal walls! And for ever cur&s;ed be the &s;laves who forced me, again&s;t my better rea|&s;on, to per&s;evere in cruelty!</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this frenzy, he was &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure by the appearance of a &s;tranger, who forcing his way violently into the apartment, approached towards the Counte&s;s, with an air and a&s;pect of affection and reverence. He ac|co&s;ted her, without deigning to ca&s;t a look upon Lord Raymond; and &s;oon perceived the wretched &s;tate to which &s;he was reduced. 'What!' cried he, <Q>no ear for joy and comfort! no voice to greet the arrival of an old faithful &s;ervant!</Q>&mdash;Raymond, ad|vancing with a &s;tern and haughty frown, demanded to know who he was, and what the cau&s;e of this bold unmannered intru&s;ion. <Q>Que&s;tion thy own ba&s;e hinds,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>who dared to forbid my approach.&mdash;Nay, let thy weapon re&s;t; I have a
<PB N="153" REF="60">&s;word as keen, and an arm as brave as thine.</Q> &mdash;Raymond here attempted to &s;ummon his attend|ants. &mdash;'Beware, proud Lord,' continued the &s;tran|ger; <Q>poor as I am, &s;ingle as I &s;tand in the mid&s;t of thy creatures, I fear not the power of Lord Raymond. The lea&s;t violence done to this per&s;on would be in&s;tantly repaid with ten-fold vengeance. If this noble dame hath been reduced to her pre|&s;ent &s;tate of mi&s;ery by thee&mdash;hear, and tremble. Yes! thou ha&s;t cau&s;e to tremble: my Lord, my gracious ma&s;ter, the princely Sali&s;bury, approach|es, and, before the clo&s;e of day, &s;hall re&s;ume his rightful power and authority within the&s;e walls.</Q> &mdash;Here, Elinor, who had li&s;tened in amazement, fell &s;uddenly on her knees, returned thanks to hea|ven with the mo&s;t rapturous devotion, and called pa&s;&s;ionately upon her mi&s;tre&s;s to hear the joyful tidings; but was an&s;wered only by a deep and heart|felt &s;igh.</P>
<P>The &s;oul of Raymond was harrowed with con&s;ter|nation. He &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s and motionle&s;s, and &s;uffered the &s;tranger to depart without further que&s;|tion. He found him&s;elf on the brow of a preci|pice, whither he had been fatally mi&s;led by the wickedne&s;s of his flatterers, and now was prevented from retreating. Ju&s;tice followed clo&s;e upon him, and vengeance was ready to pu&s;h him head long down. After an hideous pau&s;e of di&s;may, he ru&s;hed out, and once more called &s;uriou&s;ly for Grey: but Grey had heard the fatal intelligence, and hid him|&s;elf from the fury of his Lord, which echoed loudly through the halls. The attendants were collected round him, whom he ordered in&s;tantly to prepare for their departure, and to retire from this accur&s;ed place. He loudly and frequently cried out, <Q>To hor&s;e!</Q> &s;till ranging madly through the ca&s;tle in &s;earch of Grey. In this &s;tate of di&s;traction he chan|ced to e&s;py the Monk, who trembled and &s;hrunk from him, in abject terror. 'Traitor! cried Raymond,' &s;eizing him by the throat, <Q>thy fal&s;ehood hath done this. Thou ha&s;t li&s;tened to my enemies, and
<PB N="154" REF="61">been their agent to abu&s;e me by thy fal&s;ehoods, to deceive and de&s;troy me: but thou at lea&s;t &s;halt feel my vengeance.</Q> Reginhald fell at his feet, and would have expo&s;tulated; but the &s;torm in the brea&s;t of Raymond was too violent to be allayed by his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. The unhappy Lord, fully per&s;uad|ed that the Monk had purpo&s;edly framed a tale to luil him into fal&s;e &s;ecurity, called to his followers, and commanded them to hang up the traitor.&mdash; 'There,' &s;aid he, &s;ternly, repeating his command, and pointing to a large oak which &s;tood in view, near the ca&s;tle walls; <Q>there let me &s;ee my &s;entence executed without delay.</Q> And without delay did they proceed to execute this dreadful &s;entence. The wicked Reginhald, condemned by the man for whom he had proceeded to &s;uch enormous guilt, was led away, in vain imploring mercy, urging the unme|rited &s;everity of his fate, and gna&s;hing his teeth in rage and de&s;pair. Grey, from his place of conceal|ment, was terrified with the view of his brother in the agonies of death, and tortured with the fear of becoming the next victim to the di&s;tracted violence of Raymond.</P>

<P>THE dreadful intelligence, now received, was &s;peedily and fatally confirmed to the&s;e wicked intruders. Heaven had graciou&s;ly watched over the Earl of Sali&s;bury, and, with a wonderful hand, re&s;|cued him from the brink of de&s;truction. Ju&s;t in that moment when the cup, poi&s;oned by the Monk, had reached and wet his lips, a &s;udden exclamation from Chauvigny &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;compo&s;ed him. He &s;tart|ed and withdrew the fatal draught. The noi&s;e was loud in the hall, and the crowd encrea&s;ed: his eyes quickly encountered Les Roches ru&s;hing eagerly for|ward: the cup fell from his hand, and he pre&s;t on with equal ardor to meet the embraces of his long-lo&s;t friend. They clung together in that tumult of
<PB N="155" REF="62">joy which knows no words: and, when at length Les Roches found lei&s;ure to turn to Chauvigny, the gentle youth, pre&s;&s;ing him earne&s;tly in his arms, compleated his happine&s;s, by exclaiming, that Jac|queline too was &s;afe. Nature was exhau&s;ted by the&s;e violent emotions, and Les Roches &s;unk down upon a &s;eat, breathle&s;s and &s;ilent. Again recovering, he ca&s;t his eyes round, and &s;urvey'd the well-known countenances of his followers and a&s;&s;ociates, the at|tendants of Chauvigny, and &s;ome of the brave &s;ol|diers of Lord William. He &s;tarted up, and pre&s;&s;ed the hands of each: then again, turning to his two noble friends, again he gazed upon them with eager joy, and again they renewed their embraces. 'Now,' &s;aid the Earl, <Q>I &s;hall indeed return home in tri|umph: now are all my toils, my terrors and dan|gers, amply recompen&s;ed</Q> Then, re&s;uming his &s;eat at the table, he invited Les Roches to &s;hare in their repa&s;t, and to allow &s;ome indulgence and re|fre&s;hment to his fatigue.&mdash;<Q>And ha&s;t thou, in|deed, pre&s;erved my daughter?</Q> cried the French|man. <Q>Let me &s;ee her! let her father take the dear trea&s;ure to his arms! Is &s;he well? Is &s;he at hand?</Q> &mdash;<Q>Safely be&s;towed under the ho&s;pitable roof of this good Knight,</Q> replied William, and point|ed to Randolph. <Q>The noble maid &s;hall &s;traight be &s;ummoned to meet thee, and &s;oon &s;hall &s;he &s;hare thy joy.</Q>&mdash;Thanks to the eternal goodne&s;s! re|plied Les Roches, <Q>that goodne&s;s which hath been plea&s;ed to unite us to each other by mutual and repeated offices of friend&s;hip. Lo! for my daugh|ter, I pre&s;ent thee with a gi&s;t as precious.</Q> Then beckoning to one of his followers, who had enter|ed with him, the man retired, and &s;oon return|ed, leading young William in his hand, who flew to his father with tears of infant joy. The a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the Earl could &s;carcely allow him lei&s;ure to return the fond endearments of his &s;on. He looked wildly on his friend, and &s;eemed to demand an ex|planation of this wonder. 'Yes,' &s;aid Les Roches, <Q>thou do&s;t embrace thy &s;on, re&s;cued from danger,
<PB N="156" REF="63">perhaps from de&s;truction.&mdash;But be calm. Thou &s;hall be &s;atisfied. Hear then the &s;tory of my for|tunes, &s;ince I was la&s;t &s;eparated from thee, my deare&s;t Chauvigny. A few words will relate it all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou ha&s;t already heard (Lord William) how much I am indebted to this noble youth. He hath informed thee, no doubt, of our preparations for &s;eeking thee in England, and of our adventure with the pirate who attempted to &s;eize our ve&s;&s;el; little &s;u&s;pecting that &s;trength and de&s;perate re&s;olu|tion which &s;oon taught him to con&s;ult his &s;afety by a precipitate flight. Ju&s;t in that in&s;tant when the &s;welling waters had &s;eparated our &s;hips, and our enemies were crouding their &s;ails, to e&s;cape from that force which they had ra&s;hly provoked, their captain had been borne down by the pre&s;s, and lay at the feet of one of our brave followers, who&s;e &s;word was now ready to de&s;cend with fury upon his head. But I &s;topped his arm; and, perceiving our &s;ituation, that we were un&s;econded, and now &s;urrounded by our enemies, I deemed it madne&s;s to provoke them by any farther re&s;i&s;tance. I yield|ed my&s;elf a pri&s;oner; and the few who had leaped on board with me, &s;oon followed my example. At fir&s;t, the attention of our enemies was wholly engaged on &s;ecuring their e&s;cape. When they had left our ve&s;&s;el at &s;ufficient di&s;tance, their captain acco&s;ted me, and, with a gloomy courte&s;y, thanked me for re&s;cuing him from his danger. I an&s;wered, that, as he had experienced our valour, and, when we &s;till might have &s;old our liberties at a dearer rate, we had declined the effu&s;ion of blood, I hoped he would treat us nobly. He demanded to know who we were, and what our purpo&s;e. He had taken us, he &s;aid, for merchants; that, as he approached, our numbers and appearance had alarmed his people; but, as we had made every attempt in our power to avoid him, he was encou|raged to per&s;evere in his de&s;ign of attacking us: that he him&s;elf lived by plunder, and he &s;u&s;pected, that we were engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uit.</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="157" REF="64">If &s;o we might unite our force with his, and &s;hare his fortunes.</P>
<P><Q>To convince him of his mi&s;take, I informed him freely of my country, my condition, and my de&s;ti|nation, earne&s;tly conjuring him to re&s;tore me to my companions, and promi&s;ing the mo&s;t ample rewards for a &s;ervice &s;o important.</Q> <Q>Let me once regain my countrymen,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>and they &s;hall enrich thee with &s;uch a ran&s;om, as &s;hall exceed thy wi&s;hes.</Q> But not all my promi&s;es could prevail up|on <Q>the pirate again to &s;eek our &s;hip. He had ex|perienced our force, and dreaded a &s;evere revenge for his attempt. Yet my repeated &s;ollicitations at length &s;o far prevailed, that, after &s;ome time inef|fectually roving in &s;earch of prey, he propo&s;ed to keep three of my companions and my&s;elf on board, to land the re&s;t, with a &s;mall number of his own men, on the coa&s;t of England, (as it was probable our friends had &s;ought this coa&s;t) and that, if they could regain them and &s;end back the &s;tipulated ran&s;om, I &s;hould then be free. I gladly embraced this propo&s;al. The pirate &s;teered towards the land: the coa&s;t was alarmed at the &s;ight of his ve&s;&s;el: but to prevent all oppo&s;ition, we cho&s;e the dead hour of night, and &s;ent off our men in a boat, which brought them unnoticed to &s;hore. They travelled for &s;ome time, ere they had the good for|tune to find tho&s;e of our attendants whom Lord Chauvigny had left to treat for my liberty. At length, however, they were found; and the men returned, unmole&s;ted, with my ran&s;om. To this I added a rich jewel taken from my finger, which I pre&s;ented to the pirate, in acknowledgement of my gratitude.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I now ha&s;tened to join my friends, and from them I learned that Lord Chauvigny had proceeded to the city of Marlborough. I was earne&s;t to fol|low him, but my fatigues demanded &s;ome refre&s;h|ment. I was conducted to the hou&s;e of an inhabi|tant of the coa&s;t, who received me with all ho&s;pi|table kindne&s;s.&mdash;Let us unite in adoring the invi|&s;ible
<PB N="158" REF="65">power that directed my &s;teps thither!&mdash;The friendly repa&s;t was prepared for me; nor were my followers neglected. I was plea&s;ed at the hone&s;t un|de&s;igning affection of my ho&s;t, and taught to revere the generous people among&s;t whom fortune had now placed me. At the hour of re&s;t, I was courte|ou&s;ly conducted to my chamber, but my mind had been too long and too violently agitated to admit repo&s;e. I revolved the dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es I had experienced: I thought of the great purpo&s;e for which I had vi&s;ited this country: I thought of my daughter and my friend: I &s;ometimes indulged my hopes of finding them, and, again, checked and condemned the&s;e flattering imaginations. Thus did I pa&s;s the weary night, 'till rou&s;ed by a voice in the adjacent chamber. I li&s;tened attentively, and heard my ho&s;t in earne&s;t conference with his wife.</Q> "I like not," &s;aid he, <Q>this me&s;&s;age from the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I &s;tarted at the name, and re|doubled my attention.</Q>&mdash;<Q>This boy is to be care|fully guarded and concealed. But wherefore? Lord Raymond is to wed the widow of the Earl. Why then this concealment, unle&s;s he purpo&s;es to de&s;troy the young heir? I know the &s;oul of Grey; and though he be my brother, our &s;ouls are not allied. I dread his temper. Nature formed him &s;tern and cruel; nor do I doubt but that he may ea&s;ily be wrought upon to act a deed of blood. But &s;hall my humble dwelling be made the &s;cene of murder, of an infant's murder.</Q>&mdash;<Q>His wife here began to chide his jealous fears; but they &s;eemed to have taken too deep root in his mind to be ea&s;ily removed.</Q> <Q>What, tho' my hou&s;e &s;hould not be made the place of execution?</Q> &s;aid this good man; <Q>What, though they &s;hould not proceed to the ut|mo&s;t pitch of cruelty? Their purpo&s;e cannot be hone&s;t, and I am made their accomplice by con|cealing him.</Q>&mdash;I had heard enough; and now "I bu&s;ily revolved this alarming di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>It was evident that the &s;on of my pre&s;erver was expo&s;ed to danger&mdash;perhaps abandoned by his
<PB N="159" REF="66">widow&mdash;(pardon me, Lord William, if my &s;u&s;|picion was ra&s;h and ungentle)&mdash;certainly conceal|ed for &s;ome my&s;terious purpo&s;e. A &s;tranger &s;eemed to pity and to fear for him; What then became a friend? What was the part of Les Roches? Were his father &s;till alive, Heaven hath now enabled me to re&s;tore him to his arms: but, if he really hath peri&s;hed, &s;urely it mu&s;t be my care to protect and cheri&s;h this boy, to form the unhappy orphan to honour and virtue, to make him worthy of his il|lu&s;trious de&s;cent, and enable him, in due time, to a&s;&s;ert his native rights.</Q>&mdash;Thus I rea&s;oned; and, <Q>ri&s;ing with the early dawn, &s;ummoned my follow|ers, communicated this important di&s;covery, and de&s;ired their coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They readily concurred in the de&s;ign of re&s;cuing the young Lord from his pre&s;ent danger. By their advice I waited the appearance of our ho&s;t. I acco&s;ted him gently, and led him on to di&s;cour&s;e of his &s;ituation, his condition, his friends and his country. He an|&s;wered me without re&s;erve, 'till I at length menti|oned the name of Earl William, and a&s;ked if he could inform me of the fortunes of this Lord, and his noble hou&s;e. He &s;tarted, and an&s;wered, he&s;i|tating and confu&s;ed. I at once &s;ternly told him, I was no &s;tranger to the de&s;igns formed again&s;t the young heir of that hou&s;e: that, as I had been a friend to the father, I re&s;olved to be a protector to the &s;on, who, I knew, was concealed under this roof. If he would con&s;ent to give him up peaceably into my hands, the &s;ervice &s;hould be duly reward|ed; if not&mdash;I had force &s;ufficient to re&s;cue him from danger. The man trembled, and, without delay, re&s;igned his charge into my hands.&mdash;And now was my mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with new fears and &s;cruples. Methought I had been too ra&s;h. A mother's ten|derne&s;s, perhaps, hath concealed this Boy, and for a weighty cau&s;e, no doubt. How then &s;hall the news of this violent removal afflict her &s;oul? What terrors mu&s;t &s;he feel? Yet, &s;till, upon mature reflection, I deemed it the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e to convey
<PB N="160" REF="67">this youth to Marlborough, where I hoped to gain &s;uch intelligence as might direct my future conduct. Thither we bent our cour&s;e; and, near this place, did I receive tho&s;e joyful tidings, which brought me to deliver up my dear charge into his father's care.</Q></P>
<P>"From my &s;oul I thank thee," replied the Earl.&mdash; <Q>Yet hath thy tale renewed &s;ome doubts and &s;u&s;pi|cions &mdash;but let &s;u&s;picions &s;leep till to-morrow.</Q> Then, &s;tarting up earne&s;tly, he a&s;ked with a loud voice, <Q>Who of my brave followers will undertake the charge of repairing in&s;tantly to Cornwall, bearing to the fair Jacqueline the chearing news of her father's arrival, and conveying her to my ca&s;tle?</Q> Fitz|alan &s;tood forth, and with five more who defied toil and fatigue, in&s;i&s;ted that this plea&s;ing charge &s;hould be intru&s;ted to them. They departed, each fre&s;h and vigorous, as the &s;turdy hind that ri&s;es to his morning labours. And now Lord William, turning kindly towards Les Roches, attempted once more to &s;peak his joy and gratitude. But &s;uddenly his voice failed, his cheeks grew pale, a cold dew i&s;&s;ued from his pores, his whole frame was di&s;ordered, and he &s;unk faintly down. The gue&s;ts aro&s;e in confu&s;ion and amazement. Tyrrel trembled in an agony of terror, nor was his con&s;ternation unob&s;erved.&mdash; 'Trea&s;on!' cried Chauvigny, &s;eizing the fal&s;e ho&s;t, <Q>and this &s;word &s;hall revenge it.&mdash;But what revenge on thee, thou wretched &s;lave?&mdash;Say, Ha&s;t thou indeed murdered this noble Lord? Hath thy vile hand dealt him poi&s;on? Confe&s;s thy villainy, or this moment is thy la&s;t.</Q> The abject Tyrrel had fallen on his knees, and now loudly and vehement|ly a&s;&s;erted his innocence; but, when terrified by the view of in&s;tant death, he &s;crupled not to confe&s;s, that by the direction of Lord Hubert, he had in|vited the Earl to his hou&s;e, but that he was not privy to any deadly purpo&s;e; if &s;uch had heen con|certed, the Monk alone was privy, the Monk alone had executed it. Reginhald was &s;ought for, but he had fled, which confirmed their &s;u&s;picions, and filled
<PB N="161" REF="68">the hall with grief and di&s;may. William alone &s;eemed unmoved. He gently pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Les Roches: 'my enemies have prevailed,' &s;aid he, <Q>the &s;nares of Hubert have caught me.&mdash; Alas! thou knowe&s;t him not.&mdash;Vi&s;it my ca&s;tle, comfort my wife, and Oh! continue thy kind pro|tection to my &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>The grief of Lord Chauvigny was outrageous: that of Les Roches had choaked his voice. He hung over the languid Earl, in &s;ilence and con&s;terna|tion; whil&s;t, on the other hand, the boy clung pa&s;&s;ionately round the knees of his father. The &s;cene was affecting; and even the rough &s;oldier, to whom death had been long familiar, melted into tears.&mdash;'Poi&s;oned! and by Lord Hubert!' was repeated with &s;orrow and indignation. The di&s;mal tidings were &s;oon caught by bu&s;y tongues, &s;pread abroad, and propagated thro' the land, to aggravate the di&s;grace the wicked favourite was &s;oon to expe|rience.</P>
<P>His afflicted friends conveyed the Earl to his couch. And now, the good old Randolph, who&s;e venerable face had worn the deepe&s;t marks of &s;orrow, &s;eemed to be &s;uddenly enlivened by a gleam of hope. He pau&s;ed, appeared earne&s;t to collect his di&s;&s;ipated thoughts, and now looked as a man unexpectedly vi|&s;ited by comfort. The eyes of his friends were fixed upon him, as if demanding an explanation; when, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf ha&s;tily to Lord William, he a&s;ked of his pre&s;ent &s;tate, whether his pain was encrea&s;ed or his languor more oppre&s;&s;ing? He thanked the gentle Knight, and declared, that now he &s;eemed more at ea&s;e.&mdash;'Yes,' cried Randolph, <Q>and &s;oon &s;hall this malady cea&s;e, and &s;till &s;hall William live.</Q>&mdash;The Frenchmen were a&s;toni&s;hed, but the Knight confi|dently repeated his joyful a&s;&s;urances, Experienced and &s;agacious, and accu&s;tomed to &s;urvey all objects with more calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure than young Chauvigny, he revolved all the incidents, &s;ince their arrival at the hou&s;e of Tyrrel. He had marked the a&s;pect of the Monk, and from thence had formed
<PB N="162" REF="69">the blacke&s;t &s;u&s;picions of his temper and de&s;igns. He had marked his officious cares, and ob&s;equious zeal in attending on the Earl. He had marked how, at the fir&s;t entrance of Les Roches, the cup had dropt from the hands of Sali&s;bury. He recollected, that after this the Monk had not been &s;een; and ju&s;tly concluded, that this was the fatal cup which had been prepared for his friend; that the fell pur|po&s;e of Hubert had been happily de&s;eated by his &s;udden &s;urpri&s;e; and that the poi&s;onous mixture, which, if drunk mu&s;t have in&s;tantly proved fatal; had now, when but ju&s;t &s;carcely ta&s;ted, rai&s;ed a temporary di&s;order in the frame of William, which nature, &s;till free from deep infection, would &s;oon be able to overcome. The&s;e thoughts, which he com|municated to his noble companions, were received with joy; and &s;oon were they confirmed by that ea&s;e and vigour which the Earl gradually recovered. Tyrrel had been &s;ecured, and was now examined at more lei&s;ure. His di&s;coveries &s;erved to convince them of what was really the truth, that he indeed connived at the ba&s;e de&s;ign, but had not been directly an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. But he was not an object worthy of noble revenge. Again&s;t Lord Hubert was vengeance loudly denounced, and the &s;oul of Sali&s;bury was on fire to inflict the full &s;everity of ju&s;tice on his treachery and unrelenting malice.</P>
<P>His re&s;entment and indignation were &s;till to be more inflamed. The unhappy O&s;wald, who had for &s;ome time groaned under a &s;evere captivity, at length had found means to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of his keeper, who kindly con&s;ented to re|lax his hard&s;hips. When the me&s;&s;engers of Lord William were confined, he had de&s;ired, and was &s;e|cretly admitted to hold &s;ome conference with them. The keeper was witne&s;s, with what clearne&s;s and ingenuous hone&s;ty they entered into the detail of all their fortunes, and declared that their Lord mu&s;t, ere long, appear to confront his enemies. The man was alarmed: he had heard the &s;tory of O&s;wald, and he heard it now repeated with hone&s;t pity and
<PB N="163" REF="70">indignation. He was per&s;uaded that the power of Lord Raymond was &s;oon to expire; and that he &s;hould do an acceptable &s;ervice to the Earl, by fa|vouring the e&s;cape of that man who had been pu|ni&s;hed for his affection to the Counte&s;s. He revolved the&s;e thoughts for &s;ome time; at length li&s;tened to the &s;ollicitations of his pri&s;oners, and &s;uffered O&s;|wald to e&s;cape. He lay concealed for a while, re|&s;olving to take his way cautiou&s;ly towards Cornwall; but &s;oon learned the important tidings, which, by this time, began to &s;pread through the adjacent country, that the Earl of Sali&s;bury had arrived at Marlborough, and was preparing to return to his ca&s;tle. He therefore changed his cour&s;e, and directed his wary &s;teps towards the royal &s;eat. Fortunately, he encountered Fitz-Alan and his companions, who informed him where he might find their noble ma&s;ter. He entered the hall of Tyrrel at midnight, and demanded to be in&s;tantly conducted to the Earl. Alarmed at that general &s;orrow and di&s;may which dwelt upon every face, he ventured to enquire, and was &s;oon informed of the cau&s;e. Alas!' &s;aid he <Q>if the malice of his enemies hath reached the Earl, how &s;hall O&s;wald hope to e&s;cape?</Q> Then, &s;itting down in mournful &s;ilence, he pa&s;&s;ed the heavy hours in all the bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h and de&s;pair, 'till the dawn of morning.</P>
<P>The friends and va&s;&s;als of the Earl, who by this time began to collect round their Lord, had &s;carcely felt the alarm of his danger, when they received the joyful tidings of his recovery. O&s;wald too was cheared, and again demanded immediate admittance to the Earl. And he was &s;oon admitted, for his ap|pearance and demeanour promi&s;ed &s;omething extra|ordinary. He kneeled before Lord William, and wept.&mdash;'I come,' &s;aid he, <Q>from thy ca&s;tle. I come to tell thee of thy unhappy Counte&s;s.</Q>&mdash;The agi|tation of the Earl grew violent: but he commanded him to proceed, and he heard him with breathle&s;s attention; 'till O&s;wald, who began to relate all the events of the ca&s;tle of Sali&s;bury, which he had known,
<PB N="164" REF="71">proceeded without re&s;erve to de&s;cribe the oppre&s;&s;ion of Lord Raymond, with an artle&s;s and ingenuous freedom. The rage of William was kindled: he &s;tarted wildly from his &s;eat, and thundered out the mo&s;t terrible denunciations of vengeance and de&s;truc|tion. &mdash;<Q>So may this arm pro&s;per. So may this good &s;word do me &s;ervice in the hour of danger, as I will revenge thee, noble dame! And may I be cur&s;ed, and &s;corned, and vile as thou, thou recre|ant Lord, if I forget thy treachery and oppre&s;&s;ion. &mdash;But come, my friends! let us away!&mdash;O mur|derous thief! Is it thus thy wolfi&s;h nature hath &s;tolen in upon my helple&s;s fold!</Q>&mdash;His friends la|boured to recal him to calmne&s;s and attention. O&s;|wald proceeded in his tale, and filled the brea&s;ts of all his hearers with the mo&s;t enlivened indignation. He concluded with relating the reception of the me&s;|&s;engers, and his own e&s;cape, humbly imploring the protection of the Earl again&s;t his incen&s;ed Lord. 'May heaven forget me,' replied William, <Q>if I forget thy hone&s;ty. But come, my friends! if ever pity &s;oftened your brea&s;ts, if ever manhood dwelt in your noble hearts, a&s;&s;i&s;t me in puni&s;hing the injuries of my gentle Counte&s;s.</Q>&mdash;Here young William entered, and ran fondly to embrace his fa|ther. At &s;ight of him O&s;wald fell upon his knees, and with an extravagance of pious joy, thanked the gracious powers who had pre&s;erved him. The boy turned and acknowledged his former protector. Thus was the truth of all that O&s;wald had delivered won|derfully confirmed; and William renewed his thanks and promi&s;es of favour. The attendants were &s;um|moned: every moment brought in more and more of the Earl's va&s;&s;als: Les Roches, Chauvigny, and Randolph vied with each other in their expre&s;&s;ions of zeal and impatience to redre&s;s the injured. All were ready to take their way, and William enjoyed the plea&s;ing thoughts of &s;urpri&s;ing the ba&s;e u&s;urpers in the mid&s;t of their pre&s;umption. But Fitz-Alan had prevented this &s;urprize. He could not &s;uppre&s;s his impatient affection for his noble mi&s;tre&s;s. To de|light
<PB N="165" REF="72">her with the fir&s;t joyful tidings of her Lord's approach, he had turned a&s;ide and vi&s;ited the ca&s;tle; and there did he rai&s;e that confu&s;ion which had overwhelmed Lord Raymond, and his wicked crea|ture.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>BUT whil&s;t the angui&s;h and con&s;ternation of Raymond, which aro&s;e from &s;hame and remor&s;e, grew every moment more violent; Grey, who was concerned &s;olely for his per&s;onal &s;afety, gradually regained &s;ome &s;hare of recollection, and began to con&s;ider of the means to ward off the impending danger from his own head. His chief reliance was on the important &s;ervice which he conceived to be in his own power, that of di&s;covering the re&s;idence of young William, and re&s;toring him to his father. But &s;till farther to encrea&s;e his merit, and to atone for pa&s;t offences, he determined to betray his ma&s;|ter, and to give him up, naked and defencele&s;s, into the hands of his enemies. This ba&s;e re&s;olution once formed, no time was to be lo&s;t in executing it: Raymond was preparing to depart; this mu&s;t be in&s;tantly prevented. He flew among his followers and attendants: he repre&s;ented the danger which now threatened them, in the mo&s;t alarming colours: he told them, that their Lord had long proceeded in a cour&s;e of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t be revenged with indi&s;criminate fury on all who had accompanied him: that he now prepared to retire, hoping, that, whil&s;t the injured Earl was taking a bloody vengeance on his innocent followers, he might e&s;cape in the confu&s;ion: that the only means of providing for their &s;afety, of approving their in|nocence, and of di&s;arming the re&s;entment of Lord William, was to continue in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, without any appearance of ho&s;tile intentions, any purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ing the entrance of the rightful Lord of this ca&s;tle, and to oblige their leader al&s;o to &s;tay
<PB N="166" REF="73">and an&s;wer for his own actions. To the nobler few he hinted the&s;e things with caution, and they receiv|ed his in&s;inuations with di&s;dain, loudly declaring that they were re&s;olved to live or die with Raymond. To the ba&s;er and the greater number he &s;poke more plainly. To them he &s;crupled not to declare, that the violent pa&s;&s;ions of their Lord had di&s;ordered his under&s;tanding, and a&s;ked, with well-affected terror, who could be &s;afe, after the outrageous dealing with his unhappy brother, who&s;e only fault was, that he had &s;erved Lord Raymond (alas!) with too blind and too violent a zeal.&mdash;They heard him with approba|tion, and readily con&s;ented to &s;ubmit to his direction, in this dangerous emergency.</P>
<P>The unhappy Raymond was now reduced to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of human wretchedne&s;s; tormented with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own guilt and weakne&s;s; un|able to repair, or to atone for the mi&s;chief he had occa&s;ioned; pierced with all the &s;tings of remor&s;e; unable to conceal his di&s;grace, yet &s;till too great of &s;oul to bear it: helple&s;s and &s;olitary, whil&s;t the arm of vengeance was lifted again&s;t him; de&s;erted by his followers, and betrayed by the man who&s;e wick|ed arts had &s;unk him into this depth of mi&s;ery. Grey, on the other hand, &s;eemed to have compo&s;ed his fears, and to enjoy a &s;hort lived triumph. He had collected a party round him, which gave him the command of the ca&s;tle. His Lord had retired to give his di&s;tractions &s;ome moments of re&s;t; and his creatures now i&s;&s;ued out orders to his a&s;&s;ociates, to watch his motions, and even to oppo&s;e his departure by force.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his pre&s;umption, he &s;ought Lord Raymond, whom he had but now avoided, with the mo&s;t abject terror: with an in&s;olent compo&s;ure he de&s;ired him to explain his intentions.&mdash;<Q>Oh! are you come?' cried Raymond:&mdash;I have com|manded my people to prepare for departure. Let us this in&s;tant be gone!'&mdash;'Whither?' &s;aid Grey. How &s;hall we e&s;cape? Whither &s;hall we fly? The powers of Earl William are at hand.&mdash;But what of
<PB N="167" REF="74">that? His re&s;entment is not directed again&s;t us. We have not &s;ought to pollute his bed. We have not de&s;troyed the repo&s;e and happine&s;s of his wife.</Q> &mdash;His Lord &s;tarted up in &s;udden fury, as if pre|paring to puni&s;h this in&s;olence: But Grey, nothing di&s;mayed, bad him compo&s;e his pa&s;&s;ions: they had already proved too violent.&mdash;'Alas!' &s;aid he, <Q>What was the crime of my unhappy brother?&mdash; Guilty indeed he was, but not to thee, cruel Lord. But I will not upbraid thee now.&mdash;Tho&s;e fol|lowers, whom Raymond cannot protect, he mu&s;t no longer hope to command.&mdash;Nay, my Lord, &s;eek not to pa&s;s: here thou ha&s;t no longer power; this chamber mu&s;t content thee: here mu&s;t Earl William find thee. An&s;wer him as thou maye&s;t.</Q> &mdash;There only wanted this treacherous in&s;olence, to fill up the mighty &s;um of mi&s;eries, under which Raymond groaned. He found him&s;elf indeed a pri&s;oner, guarded by his own people, and in the ab&s;olute power of his perfidious creature. He &s;tood in mute &s;urpri&s;e; and Grey was ju&s;t preparing to repeat his in&s;olence, when the noi&s;e of hor&s;emen called him &s;uddenly forth.</P>
<P>A &s;mall troop had been de&s;cried at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, pre&s;&s;ing towards the ca&s;tle, with the mo&s;t violent and precipitate &s;peed. Tho&s;e of Raymond's attendants, who had refu&s;ed to unite in the treachery of Grey, fir&s;t e&s;pied their approach, and, mounting their hor&s;es, called for their Lord to &s;tand on his de|fence, or bravely to lead them again&s;t the enemy (for &s;uch they deemed them.) But Grey now ap|peared, and with a &s;udden recollection of thought, told them, in the name of Raymond, that no re&s;i&s;t|ance was to be attempted: that their Lord feared not nor would oppo&s;e the&s;e vi&s;iters: but that he directed his friends to march a mile ea&s;tward of the ca&s;tle, and there to expect him. They obeyed; and Grey now ob&s;erved the little troop more di&s;tinctly, won|dering at the &s;mall number, and &s;truck with a &s;udden and in&s;tinctive terror, when he di&s;covered Lord Wil|liam (who&s;e per&s;on he well knew) at the head of this
<PB N="168" REF="75">company. He gazed earne&s;tly round him, yet &s;till but a few per&s;ons only were in view.&mdash;'By heaven!' cried Grey, <Q>he comes not with a force to drive us hence, but to make him&s;elf our pri&s;oner:</Q> then ha&s;tily ordered his a&s;&s;ociates to &s;uffer the&s;e men to enter unoppo&s;ed and unmole&s;ted, and, in&s;tantly after|wards, to &s;hut fa&s;t the ca&s;tle-gates. He cur&s;ed his own folly and ra&s;hne&s;s, which had led him to betray him&s;elf to Lord Raymond. He now &s;aw a noble occa&s;ion of repairing his fault, and, in&s;tead of per|&s;evering in his re&s;olution of giving up Raymond into the hands of the Earl, he now deemed it in his power, and judged it the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e, to give up the Earl into the hands of his Lord.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM had indeed expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t danger, by his ungoverned violence. He had taken his way at the head of a princely re|tinue, well appointed, and zealous to vindicate his cau&s;e; &s;o that now his port was that of a warlike Baron, marching to a&s;&s;i&s;t his King, again&s;t &s;ome &s;udden inva&s;ion. Part of his powers was directed to advance towards the ca&s;tle by different approaches, &s;o as to &s;urround it, and prevent the e&s;cape of Ray|mond or his people. He him&s;elf, at the head of a cho&s;en band, attended by the two French Nobles, ru&s;hed directly forward. But the impetuo&s;ity of the Earl &s;oon left his attendants at a di&s;tance, all but young Chauvigny and a few others, who with diffi|culty kept pace with him. They arrived at the ca&s;|tle-gates, without perceiving that they were come un&s;upported; and William, far from recollecting his danger, ru&s;hed on with furious and impatient ardour, 'till he had reached the apartment of the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>He flew to take her in his arms, and &s;tarted back in an agony of terror and &s;urprize, at the di&s;covery of her unhappy condition. He called upon her with earne&s;t, yet tender accents; and now nature &s;eemed
<PB N="169" REF="76">to make &s;ome efforts to &s;hake off its lethargic weight. The Counte&s;s trembled, as at &s;ome extraordinary appearance; gazed with a look le&s;s vacant, as if the dawn of rea&s;on were returning; &s;ighed and wept.&mdash; 'Art thou,' &s;aid the Earl, turning to Elinor, who bu&s;ily a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to &s;upport her mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q>Art thou that good matron, who&s;e cares have admini&s;tered comfort to my wife?&mdash;Heaven &s;hall reward thee: and William &s;hall not be unmindful of thy hone&s;t affection. But &s;ay&mdash;conceal not the truth: Whence this &s;ad di&s;order in her noble mind? Hath not her oppre&s;&s;or compleated his vile de&s;ign? Hath he not forcibly taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her bed?</Q>&mdash;Elinor a&s;|&s;ured him, that heaven had been plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve her from &s;uch pollution; but that, &s;urprized by the &s;hocking tidings of his death, &s;he had lately fallen into this her pre&s;ent &s;tate of melancholy.&mdash;William again pre&s;&s;ed the hand of Ela. 'Speak to me,' cried he; <Q>&s;ay that thou rejoice&s;t at my return.&mdash;No word of congratulation! No look of joy? Is this the happine&s;s which my bu&s;y fancy formed? Is this my reception?</Q>&mdash;The Counte&s;s gazed upon him, and &s;eemed in violent agitation: but &s;till &s;he was unable to return his affection. Rea&s;on had not yet regained its &s;eat.&mdash;At length, the Earl, who&s;e heart was torn with angui&s;h, bounded furiou&s;ly from the ground where he had fixed his knee, and loudly de|manding the vile murderer of his peace, i&s;&s;ued forth in &s;earch of Raymond.</P>
<P>By this time the ca&s;tle was in confu&s;ion. Chau|vigny and his few attendants had been prevented, by &s;uperior numbers, from following Earl William. They expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urprize, and now began too late to perceive their danger. One of them, &s;udden|ly taking a horn from his &s;ide, prepared to give &s;o &s;hrill a bla&s;t, as would have reached the ears of their companions, and quickened their &s;peed: but Grey, who now had the &s;ole command, as &s;uddenly pre|vented him, by declaring with a &s;tern in&s;olence, that the lea&s;t alarm &s;hould prove immediate death to Lord William. His de&s;ign, which he now &s;ought to ex|ecute,
<PB N="170" REF="77">was to rai&s;e a violent broil and tumult in the ca&s;tle, and to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Earl, in the confu&s;ion. &mdash;The pre&s;ence and interpo&s;ition of Raymond he deemed nece&s;&s;ary; and he ha&s;tened to &s;ummon this Lord, to embrace the fair occa&s;ion of de&s;troying his rival, which fortune pre&s;ented to him. At fir&s;t entering the apartment, his eyes were wounded by an object of terror, which at once confounded all his de&s;igns. Raymond had fallen upon his &s;word, Grey &s;tarted back in amazement; and, in that mo|ment, William entered and &s;aw the unhappy Lord, pale and bleeding on the ground, who &s;hut his lan|guid eyes, as if a&s;hamed to meet the countenance of him he had wronged. The art, the hypocri&s;y, the boldne&s;s and recollection of Grey, all de&s;erted him. He &s;tood trembling and confounded, awed by the pre&s;ence of the Earl, as by that of a &s;uperior being. At length he attempted to retire; but William, draw|ing his &s;word, forbad him with a terrible authority, and demanded the meaning of what he now beheld. Raymond, lifting his eyes faintly, ju&s;t found breath, at broken and painful intervals, to declare, that his own hand had done it.&mdash;<Q>I have indeed wronged thee, Lord; nor could I endure thy triumph, and my own &s;hame, yes, I have de&s;troyed the noble&s;t Lady.&mdash;But there &s;tands the accur&s;ed wretch, the fal&s;e and traiterous</Q>&mdash;Here his emotion grew too violent for his languid condition. He was &s;eized with a &s;udden pang; he groaned and expired.</P>
<P>The Earl then, turning to Grey, exclaimed <Q>Yes! Thou art the wretch who laboured to aggravate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Ela, with &s;uch infernal diligence. Thou art he who ba&s;ely &s;tole away my &s;on.</Q>&mdash; Grey fell upon his knees, &s;upplicating for mercy with the mo&s;t abject and &s;ervile fear, and promi&s;ing to re&s;tore young William. The Earl rai&s;ed his arm, and prepared to &s;trike the mi&s;creant.' 'Kill me not!' cried Grey, <Q>or thy &s;on is for ever lo&s;t. I alone know the &s;ecret of his pre&s;ent re&s;idence.</Q> Here a &s;udden and violent &s;hout arre&s;ted the &s;word of Willi|am. His followers had arrived, had quickly forced
<PB N="171" REF="78">the gates open, and ru&s;hed in a rapid torrent, through the halls. Les Roches and Chauvigny, Randolph and O&s;wald, directed by the out-cries of Grey, and the loud rage of Sali&s;bury, forced in, ju&s;t as the wicked agent of oppre&s;&s;ion was entreating for mer|cy. At &s;ight of O&s;wald, de&s;pair pierced his &s;oul heart; and when he e&s;pied young William led on and protected from the violence of the rout, he clo&s;ed his eyes, and crouched to receive the deadly blow. 'O &s;hame to manhood!' cried Randolph, <Q>&s;hall &s;uch a &s;lave die by the arm of William?&mdash;Look there! noble Lord: (pointing from the window to the body of Reginhald, which &s;till hung from the oak) behold! thy ju&s;t vengeance is prevented. Behold the puni&s;hment which befits &s;uch vilene&s;s!</Q> "Be it &s;o," cried William, <Q>well do&s;t thou in&s;truct me!</Q> And, without farther re&s;pite, was Grey led forth to &s;hare the fate of his wicked brother.</P>
<P>The view of blood and death allayed the joy of William and his noble friends. The good old Knight was moved, and now &s;eemed to regret that the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of Grey, had not been inflicted but by ab|folute and violent power. All the late di&s;mal effects of lawle&s;s oppre&s;&s;ion crouded into his mind; and he felt the want of that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, a wi&s;e, righ|teous, and well attempered rule.</P>
<P>The thoughts of Ela, and her unhappy condition, &s;till diffu&s;ed a gloom over the countenance of the Earl. His thanks and congratulations were grave and &s;olemn. The body of Raymond was removed; his attendants were &s;uffered to depart unmole&s;ted; order and tram|quillity were re&s;tored in the ca&s;tle; and Lord William was at lei&s;ure to inform his noble friends of that ter|rible impre&s;&s;ion, which her misfortunes had made upon his wife. They had &s;carcely begun to offer con|dolence and comfort, when Elinor appeared with ear|ne&s;t looks, be&s;eeching the Earl in&s;tantly to vi&s;it her afflicted Lady. The &s;ight of him had awakened her to &s;ome degree of rea&s;on, and his removal had ex|cited in her mind a violent and dangerous emotion of fear and anxiety. He ha&s;tened to her pre&s;ence, lead|ing
<PB N="172" REF="79">his young &s;on, who ran to the arms of his mother. She hung upon the dear objects with tenderne&s;s and plea&s;ure, and uttered &s;ome words of joy. That me|lancholy which had clouded her noble mind, began gradually to di&s;&s;ipate. At length &s;he looked, as if rou&s;ed from a dream of mi&s;ery; returned the ardent care&s;&s;es of her hu&s;band, and breathed out her pious thanks to that goodne&s;s which had pre&s;erved him. A little time &s;o far contributed to compo&s;e her mind, that &s;he required the &s;tory of her hu&s;band's fortunes and dangers. But this he &s;u&s;pended, until her health &s;hould be confirmed, and her mind le&s;s &s;ubject to vio|lent emotions.</P>
<P>Jacqueline was now arrived; had embraced her fa|ther and her lover, and was pre&s;ented to the Counte&s;s. At &s;ight of her, Ela felt &s;ome agitation, and recol|lected the tidings which O&s;wald had conveyed to her. But when William informed her, that he had &s;aved and protected this maid from danger; that &s;he was daughter to a dear friend, to whom he owed his life; and betrothed to a noble youth, both of whom were now in the ca&s;tle; &s;he embraced her with a tender af|fection, and &s;ecretly felt &s;ome &s;hame at her former &s;u&s;picions. And now the two Barons of France, and the old Knight, were admitted to offer their congratu|lations to the Counte&s;s. The friends of Earl William crouded from different parts to &s;hare his joy, and the ca&s;tle was for &s;ome days a &s;cene of gladne&s;s and fe&s;ti|vity. But Chauvigny, impatient to compleat his hap|pine&s;s gently urged to Les Roches the nece&s;&s;ity of re|turning to France. William was &s;oon acquainted with their purpo&s;e. 'Not &s;o!' &s;aid he, <Q>Shall I not be witne&s;s of the happie&s;s now to crown the virtues of that dear maid, the lovely companion of my dan|gers, and comforter of my di&s;tre&s;s? Here, even here, &s;hall her plighted hand be given to Lord Chauvigny!</Q> &mdash;Les Roches con&s;ented; the nuptial rites were pre|pared, and celebrated with all due &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>The two &s;ons of Randolph had attended Jacqueline to the ca&s;tle; and now &s;he earne&s;tly entreated their father to permit them to accompany her to France.
<PB N="173" REF="80">'They &s;hall be my Knights,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>and &s;hall be treated with all honourable care.</Q> The Counte&s;s re|que&s;ted, with equal earne&s;tne&s;s, that Randolph would permit them to live with her &s;on. But the fond father could not yield to the&s;e &s;ollicitations: he declared that his &s;ons mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to render them&s;elves more worthy of &s;uch favour.</P>
<P>The faithful Elinor &s;till attended on her beloved mi&s;|tre&s;s, and was entertained with an affection which made the remembrance of her former misfortunes le&s;s bitter. Her brother too found that re&s;pect and reward which his hone&s;t zeal had &s;o ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P>The re&s;entment of the Earl again&s;t Lord Hubert was in &s;ome degree di&s;armed, when he received the tidings, that this wicked favourite had forfeited the royal grace, and was ignominiou&s;ly bani&s;hed. He now reflected on his wrongs without emotion. Ela too &s;eemed to forget her &s;ufferings; and each was the more endeared to the other, by the late dangers and di&s;tre&s;s of their &s;eparation.</P>

<P>"The education of youth, is a &s;ubject of &s;uch ge|neral importance, that every attempt to facilitate or improve it, mu&s;t be acceptable to the public. The fulfilling &s;o ardous and important a ta&s;k was re&s;erved for the ingenious M. Rou&s;&s;eau, an author who has al|ready merited the public applau&s;e, and from whom no|thing le&s;s than a ma&s;ter-piece could be expected.</P>
<P>The plan of this performance, which has made &s;o great a noi&s;e in mo&s;t parts of Europe, is altogether different from any treati&s;e of education hitherto pub|li&s;hed. The author &s;uppo&s;es an imaginary pupil, named Emilius; and him&s;elf to be the per&s;on entru&s;ted with the care of his education, from the time of his nativity, till he &s;ettles in the world. He attends the young gentleman with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity and care from his cradle to his nuptials; and a&s;&s;i&s;ts him with the nece&s;&s;ary directions for his general improvement. Upon his arriving at years of maturity, he introduces him to the acquaintance of an agreeable young lady, named Sophia, who&s;e affection he gains by his amiable behaviour. After a variety of affecting circum&s;tances, Emilius has the happine&s;s at length of being united in wedlock to the engaging object of his wi&s;hes. The whole is conducted in an hi&s;torical narrative, and affords not only the utility of a didactic piece, but like|wi&s;e the entertainment of an ingenious novel.</P>
<P>The author has &s;pared no pains to embelli&s;h his work with all the elegance of language, and luxuriancy of imagination. His nervous &s;tile di&s;plays tho&s;e touches and animated &s;trokes which characteri&s;e the new Eloi&s;a. There is &s;omething nobly wild and extravagant in his remarks, yet, extremely acute and &s;agacious, &s;uch as plainly evince him to be a man of genius."</P>

<P>The BEAUTIES of the Adventurer, the Rambler, World, and Connoi&s;&s;eur, &amp;c. &amp;c. In two Volumes. Price 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> neatly bound.</P>
<P>&rindx; The&s;e volumes contain 44 entertaining and in|&s;tructive hi&s;tories, every one of which is equal to any, &s;uperior to mo&s;t, of the Novels publi&s;hed, and will be a very agreeable and valuable Pre&s;ent to the Youth of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>"Among all the various methods of conveying in|&s;truction, none has been &s;o univer&s;ally and &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed, as that wherein the mind is impre&s;&s;ed with the characters of virtue, by a lively and natural detail of intere&s;ting incidents. The excellency of this me|thod con&s;i&s;ts in rendering plea&s;ure and entertainment &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of document and admoni|tion. We read a le&s;&s;on of morality, without con&s;ider|ing it as &s;uch, for the &s;ake of the &s;tory; we regard examples as the incidents of that &s;tory; and con&s;ider its precepts rather as conclu&s;ions than in&s;tructions. The pa&s;&s;ions &s;pontaneou&s;ly become the in&s;truments by which we are in&s;en&s;ibly engaged and irre&s;i&s;tibly retained in the intere&s;t of virtue; and the &s;ocial affections are awakened, united and directed to exert them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of truth.</P>
<P>"Among the other advantages that will ari&s;e from a peru&s;al of this collection, we beg leave to mention one, and that by no means incon&s;iderable, which is, that while the reader is otherwi&s;e in&s;tructed and en|tertained, he is familiarized with the beauty, &s;trength, and elegance of his own language in the greate&s;t per|fection."</P>

<P>"This piece is di&s;tingui&s;hed by elegance and purity of &s;tyle, and a plea&s;ing variety of characters, which are all along finely &s;upported; the &s;entiments are at once delicate and noble. The ba&s;is of the work is the celebrated Siege of Calais by Edward of England, yet Love almo&s;t entirely makes up the bu&s;ine&s;s of this well wrought tale. The incidents are &s;o many, &s;o intere&s;ting and important, that the readers attention is &s;trongly ex|cited and kept up through the whole narrative. The epi&s;ode of Lord Arundel and Mademoi&s;elle de Roye is indeed both intere&s;ting and affecting; but the noble &s;a|crifice made by the Count de Canaple and his compa|nions cannot be read by a per&s;on of the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility without feeling alternately all the emotions that are ex|cited by amazement, pity, and terrour, from which the reader is unexpectedly relieved by the happy, yet natural cata&s;trophe.
