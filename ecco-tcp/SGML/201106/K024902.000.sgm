<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING too often found, with no &s;mall Grief and Trouble, how little the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance of Art can avail in many Ca&s;es of the Small-Pox, I was induced to try the Method of Inci&s;ion or Inoculation, which came &s;o well recommended by &s;everal Phy&s;icians from <HI>Turkey,</HI> and which had al&s;o been lately practi&s;ed at <HI>London.</HI> This I thought was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the Attempt; and what Succe&s;s it hath met with, I have here &s;ent, according to your De&s;ire, a faithful Account of, and of every thing that has been done or ob&s;erv'd here relating to that Affair, that might be worth your Notice.</P>
<P>IT was in <HI>December</HI> la&s;t that I fir&s;t began to put this Me|thod in practice, and finding it to &s;ucceed beyond my Ex|pectation in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, I was encourag'd to repeat it upon &s;ome others; and afterwards &s;everal &s;eeing with how much Ea&s;e the&s;e got thro' the Di&s;temper, were de&s;irous to have the &s;ame done to them&s;elves, or to their Children; &s;o that there are now upwards of Forty here, who have re|ceiv'd the Small-Pox by Inoculation, who are all, through God's Ble&s;&s;ing, in very good Health.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>WHAT was done by way of Preparation, was chiefly Pur|ging with Rhubarb, for Children, and &s;ometimes Vomiting, very rarely Bleeding; tho' that may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary; and many have had no Preparation at all: But I always found, as far as I was able to judge, that tho&s;e who&s;e Bodies were prepared, e&s;pecially by Vomiting, had more favourable Sym|ptoms than others in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances where that was omitted.</P>
<P>THE Method which I always took in the Operation, was to make two Inci&s;ions, one in the Arm, and another in the oppo&s;ite Leg; I believe it is not very material whether the Inci&s;ions be large or &s;mall, but I commonly found that when they were made pretty large (in grown Per&s;ons &frac34; of an Inch in Length, proportionably le&s;s in Children, and &s;o deep as to cut thro' the Skin in the middle of the Inci&s;ion) the Quantity of Matter di&s;charged afterwards at tho&s;e places, was greater; and the more plentiful that Di&s;charge, the more ea&s;y the re&s;t of the Symptoms generally are; and they are al&s;o by this means the be&s;t &s;ecured from any ill Con&s;equence afterwards.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t I collected &s;ome of the Matter from the Pu&s;tules of one who had the Small-Pox of the natural &s;ort, into a Shell or a Viol, and infus'd two or three Drops of it into the Wound; but finding it &s;ometimes to be very trouble&s;om and difficult to get any Quantity of the Matter; and ob&s;erving al|&s;o that the lea&s;t imaginable will be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, I generally take &s;mall Pledgetts of Cotton, and ripping the Pu&s;tules when they are ripe with the Point of a Lancet, roll the Pledgetts over them till they have imbib'd &s;ome of the Moi&s;ture; I put one of the&s;e upon each Wound, covering them with any common Plai&s;ter 'till the next Day, when I commonly take away both the Cotton and the Plai&s;ter, lea|ving the Wound to it&s;elf, only covering it with a &s;light Lin|nen Roller to defend it from the Air. I have &s;ometimes rub'd the Pledgett only once over the Wound, without bin|ding it on, which I found to an&s;wer the End as well; and from &s;ome other Ob&s;ervations I have made, I have been &s;ur|priz'd
<PB N="5" REF="5">to &s;ee the Small-Pox produced this way, when I was very well a&s;&s;ured, the Quantity of Matter receiv'd into the Ve&s;&s;els cou'd not amount to the Hundreth Part of a Grain.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ons inoculated have not been confin'd to any Regimen, only to keep them&s;elves moderately warm; and tho&s;e who were grown up to live very temperate and regular, to keep their Minds ea&s;y and compos'd, and to u&s;e proper Means to drive away all Fear and Concern. Some have been obliged, from the time of the Inoculation, to ab|&s;tain from Fle&s;h, and all &s;trong Liquors; but I found after|wards that the Eruption did not proceed &s;o well, when they were obliged to live too low; perhaps, in warmer Cli|mates, where they are not &s;o much accu&s;tom'd to live up|on Fle&s;h, &s;uch Ab&s;tinence may be nece&s;&s;ary; but here I find it be&s;t to let them cat and drink as u&s;ual, tho' &s;ome|thing more &s;paringly, 'till the Fever begins to ri&s;e, and then, but not before, we enjoin &s;uch a Regimen as is u&s;u|al in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that occurr'd after the Inci&s;ion, was the Inflammation of the Wounds, which commonly happen'd about the fourth Day, when they began to appear very red round about, and to grow a little &s;ore and painful; in about two Days more they began to dige&s;t and run; in &s;ome they begin to run &s;ooner, and the Quantity di&s;|charged is much greater than in others. I generally found, that in tho&s;e who di&s;charged mo&s;t this way, the Fever was more &s;light, and the Small-Pox fewer; tho' I have known &s;ome do very well, when the&s;e Places have only appear'd very red, but have not run at all, as it u&s;ually happens when the Inci&s;ion is made &s;o &s;uperficial as not to cut thro' the Skin.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;eventh Day, the Symptoms of the Fever begin to come on, which are the very &s;ame that we al|ways ob&s;erve in the Small-Pox of the di&s;tinct Kind in the natural Way; a quick Pul&s;e, great Heat and Thir&s;t, Pain in the Head and Back, and about the Region of the Sto|mach,
<PB N="6" REF="6">Vomiting, Do&s;edne&s;s, Startings, and &s;ometimes Con|vul&s;ions. All were not &s;eized with the&s;e Symptoms, nor in the &s;ame Degree or Continuance; &s;ome began on the &s;eventh Day, and continued ill without any Remi&s;&s;ion 'till after the eleventh; many not 'till the eighth or ninth Day; and the Fever in the&s;e was more moderate, with great In|termi&s;&s;ions; but &s;ome have &s;carce had any Illne&s;s at all: During all this time the Places of Inci&s;ion continued to be very &s;ore, and &s;well very much, &s;o as to appear large and deep, and to di&s;charge a great deal of Matter.</P>
<P>ON the tenth Day the Small-Pox mo&s;t commonly did ap|pear, &s;ometimes on the ninth, and &s;ometimes not 'till the eleventh; but I never found that any Difference of Age, Con&s;titution, or any other Cau&s;e, ever made them vary a|bove one Day from the tenth. The Number was very dif|ferent, in &s;ome not above ten or twenty, mo&s;t frequently from fifty to two Hundred, and &s;ome had more than cou'd well be numbred, but never of the Confluent &s;ort: Their Appearance was the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the di&s;tinct Kind; they commonly come out very round and florid, and ma|ny times ri&s;e as large as any I have ob&s;erved of the natu|ral &s;ort, going off with a yellow Cru&s;t or Scab, as u&s;ual; tho' it &s;ometimes happens, e&s;pecially when the Sores di&s;|charge a very great Quantity of Matter, that they are both few in Number, and do not ri&s;e to any Bulk; but having made their Appearance for four or five Days, they wa&s;te in|&s;en&s;ibly away.</P>
<P>AFTER the Small-Pox comes out, the feveri&s;h Symptoms gradually abate; and when the Eruption is compleated they u&s;ually cea&s;e, without any &s;econd Fever, or any farther Trouble in any re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WHILE the Pu&s;tules were ri&s;ing, and for &s;ome time after they were gone, the Sores continued to &s;well, and to run very much; the longer they did &s;o, the better; but they never fail'd to heal up, without any Trouble, after a certain Time.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>I very rarely &s;aw occa&s;ion for any Medicines in the cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, only &s;ometimes, when the Symptoms run very high, I gave a gentle Anodyne, to be repeated as Oc|ca&s;ion &s;hould require; and once or twice I thought it nece&s;|&s;ary to Bli&s;ter. After the Small-Pox is gone, they have al|ways been Purged twice or thrice, and &s;ometimes let Blood, which is all that has been u&s;ually done.</P>
<P>IT has happen'd in one In&s;tance or two, that the Symp|toms in the Di&s;temper have been wor&s;e than u&s;ual; and &s;ome few, after the Small-Pox were gone off, have been &s;ubject to other Indi&s;po&s;itions; of all which I &s;hall give you a par|ticular Account.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t that was inoculated,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tho. Thorp</HI>'s Son of <HI>Halli|fax.</HI></NOTE> a Boy about a Year and half old, began to be ill on the eighth Day, and had a brisk Fever for about two Days; when the Pu&s;tules began to appear, they were but few in Number, and ro&s;e very large; the Child was &s;oon well, and continu'd &s;o for about three Weeks, when being carry'd out, and kept a long time in the cold, he fell into a feveri&s;h Di&s;order, accompany'd with a Cough, and was ill for four or five Days; after that time it went off, and he has ever &s;ince been in very good Health.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd was a Girl of two Years old,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jer. Turner</HI>'s Daughter.</NOTE> in a Family where they had formerly bury'd their Children &s;ucce&s;&s;ively of the Small-Pox, and this they fear'd might undergo the &s;ame Fate. The Fever came on about the &s;eventh Day, and &s;he continu'd very ill 'till the tenth; on which Day about Noon &s;he had a &s;trong convul&s;ive Fit; towards Evening the Pu&s;tules appeared, and the Child grew better; and tho' &s;he had more in Number than u&s;ual, yet &s;he grew well as &s;oon as they were fully come out, and has continu'd &s;o ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>THE eighth and ninth were in a Family where they had four Children, none of whom had had the Small-Pox.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>John Symp|&s;on</HI>'s Children.</NOTE> I was call'd to the elde&s;t, who was &s;eized in the common way with the mo&s;t Malignant &s;ort I ever &s;aw, attended with the wor&s;t Symptoms that could be; &s;o that he dy'd on the fourth Day, all full of Purple and Livid Spots. The Parents were
<PB N="8" REF="8">very de&s;irous that any Means might be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the re&s;t; but here I was in great Doubt and Perplexity what Part to act. I knew very well, that if I &s;hould venture to make the <HI>Inci&s;ion,</HI> whatever &s;hould happen would be char|ged upon that; and it was not improbable but &s;ome of them might have already taken the Infection; in which ca&s;e it was very uncertain what the Event might be. On the other hand, if it was omitted, I thought it probable they might all dye, the Contagion which was got among&s;t 'em being of &s;uch a de&s;tructive Nature: Wherefore I was wil|ling to run the ri&s;que of my Reputation, rather than that the Children &s;hould all peri&s;h. They were therefore all three Inoculated the Day before the elde&s;t died, after ha|ving told the Parents that I cou'd not an&s;wer for the Con|&s;equence, in ca&s;e they had already catch'd the Infection; which wou'd be known if any of them fell ill before the &s;eventh Day. According as we fear'd, one of them began on the &s;econd Day, much after the &s;ame manner with the elde&s;t; and the Small-Pox came out on the third Day, or rather an univer&s;al Redne&s;s all over the Skin, inter&s;pers'd with many purple Spots. There were none of the&s;e Spots near the Places of Inci&s;ion, which began to &s;well a little (as u&s;ual) about the fourth Day, and the Small-Pox did ri&s;e a little more about tho&s;e places than el&s;ewhere; but Nature was too much oppre&s;s'd with the Violence of the Di&s;temper; and tho' &s;he continu'd longer than her Brother, and was not Delirious as he was, yet &s;he dyed on the &s;e|venth Day. I did not reckon this Child in the Number of tho&s;e who receiv'd the Small-Pox by Inoculation; for I thought there was &s;ufficient rea&s;on to conclude that &s;he had taken the Infection before; but of this we mu&s;t leave all Per|&s;ons to judge as they plea&s;e; I only give you a Relation of Facts The other two continu'd well 'till the eighth Day, when they both fell ill together; the Small-Pox came out on the tenth, of a very good Sort, tho' more in Number than &s;ome others had; and they both got very ea&s;ily thro' the Di|&s;temper
<PB N="9" REF="9">without any Indi&s;po&s;ition &s;ince. It was ob&s;erva|ble that the Elder of the&s;e Children two days before the E|ruption, had many red Spots which appear'd upon him, very much like tho&s;e of the other two Children, which changed in them to Purples afterwards; which the Mo|ther was very much concern'd at, fearing they would prove the &s;ame in this: But when the Small-Pox came out, the&s;e Spots grew gradually le&s;s, and at la&s;t quite di&s;appear'd. The other Child had been very &s;ubject to Convul&s;ions for a long time when young, and it was afflicted with the &s;ame very much from the time that the Fever came on 'till the Small-Pox appear'd.</P>
<P>THE twenty &s;eventh, was a married Gentlewoman aged a|bout twenty &s;ix, who got very well thro' the Di&s;temper, but about a Week after, was &s;eiz'd with a very great Coldne&s;s and Shivering, which were follow'd by a Burning-heat, with a violent Pain and di&s;order in her Head, which continu'd for &s;e|veral Hours: She had about two Years ago an intermitting Fe|ver, which I took this to be a Paroxi&s;m of, and expected its return; but &s;he felt no more of it, and has ever &s;ince conti|nu'd in good Health.</P>
<P>OF her two Sons who were both Inoculated about the &s;ame time, the Younger got thro' the Di&s;temper with a great deal of Ea&s;e; the Small-Pox being few, and the Symptoms very &s;light: But the Elder (a Boy about five Years old) fared quite otherwi&s;e. The Symptoms before the Eruption were more than u&s;ually &s;evere, e&s;pecially the Vomitting; the Pu&s;tules appear'd at the u&s;ual time, but more numerous than ordinary; and when the Eruption was fini&s;hed, the Fever did not cea&s;e as it has done in every in&s;tance but this: On the fifth day after he was &s;eiz'd, the &s;welling of his Face began, which was follow'd by a Pain and Swelling in his Throat, and a Salivation, which continuing 'till the cleventh day, were &s;ucceeded by a &s;welling in his Hands and Feet, the u&s;ual Symptoms of the Di&s;tinct &s;ort when they are very full; and tho' there appear'd &s;ome little Signs of Malignity, yet he got thro' the Di&s;temper without any
<PB N="10" REF="10">Danger, but with much more Pain and Trouble than any of the re&s;t have endured. After the Small-Pox were gone off, we found a hard Swelling upon his Shoulder, which di&s;a|bled him for &s;ome time from moving his Arm; but by the u&s;e of &s;ome common Applications, that is in a great mea&s;ure gone. In this Family, the only Child they had before the&s;e, dyed of the Small-Pox, of a very malignant Sort; and this Boy was of an ill Habit of Body, and has had many dange|rous Illne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE twenty third was a Girl about nine Months old:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>I&s;. Han&s;oo</HI>'s Daughter.</NOTE> In this Child, about a Fortnight after &s;he was well of the Small-Pox, the Mother di&s;cover'd that one of her Thighs was a little &s;well'd, which was painful to her for &s;ome time, and made her unwilling to move that Part: Some of the Inguinal Glands were al&s;o &s;well'd; but the&s;e went off in a few Days, there only remaining a Hardne&s;s above the Knee, which al&s;o di&s;appear'd in a &s;hort time, without coming to Suppuration.</P>
<P>THE thirty &s;eventh was a Girl,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Jo. Haigh</HI>'s Daughter.</NOTE> &s;ix Years of Age; &s;he got ve|ry ea&s;ily thro' the Di&s;temper; but before the Small-Pox were gone, we found a &s;mall Tumour upon the Mu&s;cles of the Loins, which ripen'd very &s;peedily, and was open'd and heal'd up in a very &s;hort time. Her Si&s;ter, a young Woman about eighteen, had al&s;o a Swelling of the &s;ame Kind in her Leg, but it lay &s;omething deeper, and gave her a great deal of Pain for three or four Days; afterwards it di&s;char'd a great Quan|tity of Matter, and was heal'd without any farther Trouble.</P>
<P>ALL the re&s;t, excepting the&s;e I have mention'd, got ve|ry well thro' the Di&s;temper, without any manner of Trou|ble, or Hazard, or any ill Con&s;equence afterwards. Whe|ther tho&s;e &s;light Indi&s;po&s;itions which &s;ome have been &s;ubject to afterwards, were owing to the Inci&s;ion, I have not been able to judge; but I pre&s;ume, what they have endured in the cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, and what has follow'd after, is not to be put in the Ballance with what is undergone in the com|mon way, by tho&s;e who are thought to come off very well: And if this Method were more generally practi&s;ed, 'tis pro|bable &s;ome Means would be found out to prevent even the&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="11">&s;ub&s;equent Di&s;orders, which are no more frequent, nor near &s;o bad as tho&s;e which follow the natural Sort.</P>
<P>IN two In&s;tances the Inoculation had no Effect; the Rea|of which in
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Michacel Bland</HI>'s Daugh|ter.</NOTE> one was, becau&s;e the Child had the Small-Pox before; in the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Wm. Clark</HI>'s Son.</NOTE> other, the Matter was taken whenthe Pu|&s;tules were wither'd, and almo&s;t gone, and that little Moi|&s;ture which they contain'd, I &s;uppo&s;e, had lo&s;t its Virtue: The Boy to whom it was made u&s;e of was no way affected, the Places of Inci&s;ion did not at all Inflame and &s;well, as u&s;ual, nor did any Pu&s;tules appear, but about a Fortnight af|ter, he was &s;eized with the Di&s;temper in the common way, and did very well.</P>
<P>SOME of tho&s;e who have been Inoculated that are grown up, have afterwards attended others in the Small-Pox; and it has often happen'd, that in Families where &s;ome Children have been Inoculated, others have been af|terwards &s;eiz'd in the common way; and they have laid together in the &s;ame Bed all the time; but we never found that ever any had the Di&s;temper twice; neither is there a|ny rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, there being no Difference that can be ob&s;erved betwixt the Natural and the Artifi|cial Sort, (if we may be allow'd to call them &s;o) but on|ly that the latter have commonly fewer. There is one Ob&s;ervation which I have made, (tho' I wou'd not yet lay any creat Stre&s;s upon it;) that in Families where any have been Inoculated, tho&s;e who were afterwards &s;eized, never had an ill Sort of Small-Pox, but always recover'd very well.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I have given you a &s;hort and plain Ac|count of what has occurr'd to me, concerning this Me|thod of Inoculation. 'Tis not any Pains or Care I have taken in writing this Letter, will make it acceptable to you; for I am &s;en&s;ible it is deficient in every Re&s;pect, but a faithful Hi&s;tory of Matters of Fact. I could have In|oculated a much greater Number than I have done, if I would have pre&s;s'd it; but I only took &s;uch as de&s;ired it of them&s;elves; being cautious of per&s;uading any body to it; becau&s;e I had no Authority hereabouts to &s;upport me. I
<PB N="12" REF="12">know not whether I &s;hall have an Opportunity of doing much more this way at pre&s;ent, the Small-Pox being in a great mea&s;ure gone from this Town and Country; but I have already &s;een &s;o much of it, that I &s;hould never be afraid of its Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is only one thing more which I am oblig'd to mention, and which I wou'd rather have pa&s;s'd over in &s;ilence, and that is, the vigorous Oppo&s;ition it has met with from many hone&s;t well-meaning Per&s;ons, who can|not but fancy it is an unlawful and unwarrantable Prac|tice: They have gain'd a great Majority on their Side here, as well as in other Places where it has been practi&s;ed; I only wi&s;h, that as they act upon a Principle of Con&s;ci|ence, they wou'd have been le&s;s bu&s;y in rai&s;ing and &s;prea|ding fal&s;e and groundle&s;s Reports, whereby this Matter has been much mi&s;-repre&s;ented, and many entertaining a wrong Notion of it, have been deterr'd from making u&s;e of this Method for them&s;elves or their Children, who have &s;ince unhappily been taken off by the Small-Pox. But when this Affair it &s;et in a true Light, and found to be always &s;afe and effectual, I believe all the Objections rai&s;ed again&s;t it will fall of cour&s;e. It would be of the greate&s;t moment, that the World &s;hould know more ful|ly what you think of it in Town, and how you have found it to &s;ucceed.
