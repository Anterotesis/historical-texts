<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may remember when I had the plea&s;ure of &s;pending a day with you at your Seat in&mdash;<HI>&s;hire,</HI> that the di&s;cour&s;e after dinner turned on the Subject of Ho&s;pitals, as lately erected in many of the Counties in England. The Company in general applauded &s;uch undertakings; a few doubted whether they were always conducted in the mo&s;t proper manner, while one per&s;on ventured to &s;ay, they did more harm than good. I perceived your Humanity was hurt at this la&s;t in&s;inuation, and &s;aw by the &s;ignificancy of your Looks, that you wi&s;hed as you knew how highly I approve &s;uch In|&s;titutions, that I would have &s;tood forth in their defence.</P>
<P>What I then declined doing in conver&s;ation, I am very willing to do by Letter. I had two rea&s;ons for not entering on the Subject at that time; One, becau&s;e I was not prepared to treat it fully; the other, becau&s;e a large company is very &s;eldom an at|tentive one. You mu&s;t often have ob&s;erved that in
<PB N="4" REF="3">the unre&s;trained freedom e&s;&s;ential to &s;ocial debates, too many are apt to &s;peak at once; and thus bring ob|jections fa&s;ter and in greater number, than the defen|dant has time to remove or comprehend; whereas &s;everal objections would &s;ucce&s;&s;ively vani&s;h before an uninterrupted explanation; and arguments are known to derive accumulated force, from relative and ne|ce&s;&s;ary connections.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible I believe for minds to be &s;o influenced by Error as to indulge &s;peculation to the exclu&s;ion of practical duties; it mu&s;t have been from &s;uch a principle that any one ever thought the life of a mu|tilated Slave, not worth pre&s;erving, or that we were under the dominion of &s;uch a Fatality, as rendered &s;uccour to the &s;ick, needle&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not to &s;uch as the&s;e I direct my thoughts, but to &s;uch as convinced of the utility and nece&s;&s;ity of this branch of benevolence, wi&s;h only to &s;ee it pract|i&s;ed in the be&s;t manner it is capable of, and as little injured as may be, by the imperfections of human management.</P>
<P>The chief and foundation Stone of the&s;e benevolent Structures, is the relief of &s;ick and &s;uffering Poverty. Thus far all build alike; this is the undoubted aim of every contributor. And yet though this principle &s;eems of a very &s;imple kind, it becomes when re|duced
<PB N="5" REF="4">to practice more complicated than could be wi&s;hed; and hence it is that the Rules and Orders of mo&s;t Infirmaries, can &s;o &s;eldom be entirely complied with. They generally exi&s;t previous to any trial, how far they may chance to be more or le&s;s benefi|cial to the main de&s;ign; Experience, and Experience only, can properly teach us this. There is a variety of perplexed circum&s;tances in the Ca&s;e of many who petition for relief in Ho&s;pitals, which no Rule can regulate, and many Rules make wor&s;e: while the relaxation of a rule, begins confu&s;ion, and a tempo|rary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion compleats it.</P>
<P>The Rules and Orders of every Ho&s;pital are de|&s;igned to operate in two points: for the benefit of the Patient, and the good order of the hou&s;e; to &s;tate what are the Qualifications that render the &s;ick, pro|per objects of charity; and what conduct of theirs is nece&s;&s;ary to give them a chance for relief. To which is added, and with great propriety, what kind of Be|haviour is expected from them in return.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak to each of the&s;e articles, by which it will appear how difficult it is to confine them to uni|form Rules.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to <HI>Poverty,</HI> I would have that always re&s;t upon the Credit of the Recommender, as it would be impo&s;&s;ible to examine into it, during the
<PB N="6" REF="5">time allotted for the admi&s;&s;ion of patients; be&s;ides that the &s;tate which qualifies the Petitioner to be fa|vourably heard, does not entirely depend on his being in ab&s;olute want. The poor Wretch who has by &s;evere labour accumulated a few pounds, may be very unable to &s;upport him&s;elf and family, under a &s;evere illne&s;s, without ruining his little hoard; and &s;pending perhaps in a few weeks, what was the la|bour of years to acquire. Humanity &s;eldom errs, tho' judgement may.</P>
<P>But the nature of the di&s;temper is a more difficult circum&s;tance. There is a certain fence between the Pauper and this kind of Charity, which one knows not ea&s;ily where to place. There will in mo&s;t Infir|maries be more Candidates for relief, than money to accompli&s;h the good de&s;ign; it is very proper there|fore to lay it out where there is the greate&s;t likeli|hood of &s;ucce&s;s, and to withhold it from &s;uch as &s;eem incapable of benefit. On this principle is founded the regulation of <HI>excepted ca&s;es.</HI> Some Di&s;orders pro|claim at fir&s;t &s;ight the impo&s;&s;ibility of a Cure, and are therefore properly rejected; others are &s;o far ad|vanced that we have little chance of removing them; yet it is not always &s;afe to pronounce the di&s;order in the la&s;t &s;tage, and the Patient in a dying Condition; here the Phy&s;ician holds the &s;cale with a trembling hand, to &s;ee whether Pity or Ju&s;tice mu&s;t preponde|rate. <HI>Mon&s;tra fiunt in Medicin&acirc;,</HI> is a well known and
<PB N="7" REF="6">indi&s;putable axiom, and to &s;ay exactly when nature has done her all, and Art can do no more, is in &s;ome Ca&s;es impo&s;&s;ible. You &s;ee by this that my Inclina|tion tends to admit of almo&s;t hopele&s;s Ca&s;es, in order for <HI>trial.</HI> How trifling does the objection of hazard|ing a little expence appear, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the attempt of &s;aving a u&s;eful Life?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing our hope of &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould be too &s;anguine, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of giving any relief confirmed, and the Patient during the experiment become too bad for removal, what is to be done then? I make no &s;cruple to an&s;wer, the Patient ought to die with us. I acknowledge that the primary Inten|tion of the&s;e Charities is the Re&s;toration of Health and Ea&s;e, and that when the undertaking appears very unfavourable, we &s;hould deliberate before we determine to receive the Patient; but &s;hould we be accidentally obliged to let the Patient die with us, I in&s;i&s;t we are <HI>Charitable</HI> &s;till. There are &s;ome &s;uf|ferings at the clo&s;e of &s;ome lives, which Humanity mu&s;t ever wi&s;h to &s;often; and which the&s;e In&s;titu|tions certainly do; nay the letting one &s;ingle Life ex|pire with us, may be the pre&s;ervation of many. The pauper would probably at home have expired (per|haps offen&s;ively) in the &s;ame &s;mall bed, with his wife and infant family; Di&s;temper might thus be propa|gated, for want of Air and Room, to a whole Cottage, and &s;even peri&s;h in&s;tead of one. We improve on
<PB N="8" REF="7">Humanity, while we prevent tho&s;e evils which we are not certain we could cure, and do as much good and at le&s;s expence, by obviating as by removing complaints.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged on all hands, becau&s;e it is de|mon&s;trable, that the expence of the In-Patients is con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed by the length of time they are obliged to &s;tay in the hou&s;e; but would the &s;uperfi|cial readers of our annual accounts, or the rigid ad|vocates for unremitting Oeconomy, but deign to vi|&s;it the&s;e Scenes of &s;uffering, they would acknowledge their money was not wantonly expended, and that the number of wretched &s;ufferers mu&s;t occa&s;ion a con&s;iderably larger di&s;bur&s;ement; &s;till however as far as may be, to reconcile Oeconomy with Humanity, let it be &s;eriou&s;ly remembered, that would the Pau|pers them&s;elves, or their friends or Pari&s;h Officers for them, &s;end them for help at the beginning of Sores, Hurts in the Joints, &amp;c. their Cures would be compleated in a much &s;horter time, with infinitely le&s;s pain to them&s;elves, and proportionally le&s;s ex|pence to us. If they come to us however in a far advanced State of Evil, in God's name let us &s;pare no expence for their recovery. I had rather Addenbrooke's Ho&s;pital &s;hould never be any bigger than it is, than figure away in our account with twenty times the number of Patients, and not do half the good.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>To obviate however every objection of this kind as much as may be, and to keep clear of a tax which Infirmaries moderately endowed can ill &s;upport, it is one of our rules, that Patients living at a great di&s;tance where we cannot examine them our&s;elves, &s;hould &s;end by an Apothecary or Surgeon, the exact &s;tate of their Ca&s;e, that their coming may be pre|vented, if deemed unnece&s;&s;ary or improper.</P>
<P>One of the Ca&s;es generally refu&s;ed admittance into Ho&s;pitals is that of Epileptic Fits, and with great propriety; as the &s;ight of them has been known to occa&s;ion the &s;ame di&s;order, in per&s;ons not before afflicted with them. Indeed they are in many In|&s;tances &s;o unconquerable, that all attempts to relieve them are fruitle&s;s. But even to allow the&s;e Objects every po&s;&s;ible Chance, they are con&s;tantly admitted on the Li&s;t as Out Patients. It were however to be wi&s;hed that all Objects of this kind could re&s;ide in the &s;ame Town in which the Infirmary is placed; as &s;uch per&s;ons being obliged to walk a con&s;iderable way, to or from an Ho&s;pital, may chance to fall in going over narrow planks, walking by the &s;ide of Ditches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The only poor to whom I think we &s;hould deny, or but &s;paringly afford our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are the Vete|rans in iniquitous Habits; not from any want of common humanity, or from a pre&s;umptuous con|demning
<PB N="10" REF="9">of others, but becau&s;e we here &s;trive again&s;t the Stream, we attempt impo&s;&s;ibilities. The Di&s;ea&s;e, as well as Habit, is become incurable from a repeti|tion of the &s;ame Cau&s;es, which fir&s;t produced it, and the con&s;tant continuance of which feeds and inflames it. Habitual Drunkenne&s;s is therefore the greate&s;t di&s;qualification of an object that de&s;ires relief in this way. And indeed the very few Patients of this Cla&s;s, who have not entirely drowned their under|&s;tandings, are &s;en&s;ible enough of the impropriety of their application, and acknowledge their expectation of relief to be very little; becau&s;e they own they have drank hard in their time, which generally means, as long as they were able.</P>
<P>Another &s;pecies of Di&s;ea&s;e, at lea&s;t in an advanced State is rejected, becau&s;e very trouble&s;ome in its con&s;equences, very tedious in its Cure, requiring &s;ometimes uncommon attendance, and u&s;ually the lot of the very profligate. Our Ho&s;pital, as far as it can, endeavours to &s;end out its patients more vir|tuous than it receives them; endeavouring to pro|mote as will hereafter be ob&s;erved, every good di&s;|po&s;ition by Prayers, Advice and Books.</P>
<P>There is yet one kind of Patients more who mu&s;t ever be deemed proper Objects of our Charity. I mean tho&s;e, who are taken ill during a con&s;tant re|&s;idence here in a diligent exerci&s;e of their employ|ment,
<PB N="11" REF="10">though barely &s;ufficient for the maintenance of them&s;elves, or family. To &s;end the&s;e in a dangerous or langui&s;hing State to &s;uch Ho&s;pitals as from their &s;ettlement they would have a claim to, would be often impo&s;&s;ible, and always inhuman. And it &s;hould be remembered that the benevolent Founder of our Ho&s;|pital, meant it to be for any poor &s;ick per&s;on what|ever, not limiting them to Place or County; and what|ever regulations have been obliged to be introduced of this kind, are entirely owing to the impo&s;&s;ibility of fulfilling his wi&s;h, and the propriety of giving a preference, when nece&s;&s;ary, to our Town, County, and the I&s;le of Ely.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed my Ob&s;ervations on what &s;eem the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications to render Patients proper Objects for an Infirmary to relieve, it comes next in turn to con&s;ider by what methods the relief of each can be&s;t be attempted.</P>
<P>As no Ho&s;pital can properly contain the num|bers that every week &s;ollicit to be admitted, the &s;ick are on this account nece&s;&s;arily divided into In and Out Patients. This is unavoidable, and atten|tion is therefore paid to the mo&s;t immediate di&s;tre&s;s, and Objects of this &s;ort preferred to be taken in. But it often happens that patients are not excluded for want of room, but becau&s;e they cannot find time to come in. The heads of families cannot always be
<PB N="12" REF="11">&s;pared from home. If a mother, &s;he is wanted to look after the children; if a Father, he mu&s;t try to work, however little, to maintain them. Whatever be the Cau&s;e, the con&s;equence is clear, that Out Pa|tients cannot have equal a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with tho&s;e within; and &s;ome inconveniences follow, and cannot be a|voided both to them&s;elves, and the Charity that a&s;&s;i&s;ts them. A&s;&s;i&s;tance can only be given to &s;uch Suffer|ers by obliging them to come to the Ho&s;pital for Advice and Medicines. They mu&s;t come for the&s;e upon a &s;tated day of the week, whatever may chance to lengthen the Intervals between their coming. If they come in bad weather, they encrea&s;e their com|plaints; if they wait too long for good they are with|out medicines. It often happens that they come miles, and almo&s;t always that they walk. The&s;e circum&s;tances it is to be feared, abate the efficacy of pre&s;criptions, and &s;ometimes entirely fru&s;trate their de&s;ign. Be&s;ides which the treatment cannot always be &s;o well adapted to their complaint, as in the Hou&s;e; &s;ome remedies require caution in the admi|ni&s;tring, and mo&s;t find an auxiliary in proper diet, little of which I &s;uppo&s;e is to be met with in poor Cottages; nay the very form of the medicines parti|cipate in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the inconvenience, and as the time of year happens, &s;uch as will keep longe&s;t mu&s;t have the preference to others that would exert their effect more &s;peedily or powerfully.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>And here let me note a prevalent error among the ignorant part of mankind in general, and that is a notion that the fir&s;t pre&s;cription is always meant for the immediate eradication of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and there|fore if they find them&s;elves di&s;appointed in this, they give over, and take no more. Whereas &s;ome Ca&s;es and con&s;titutions require a little previous prepara|tion to give medicines a Chance of doing good, and perhaps to prevent them doing harm. Bleeding and &s;ome other evacuations, belong to this introductory Cla&s;s of Relief. And I have &s;ometimes had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that more harm has been done by thus un|&s;ea&s;onably &s;topping &s;hort, than would have followed from having done nothing at all.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this explanation, in order to account for the rea&s;on of the great number of Out Patients generally remaining on Ho&s;pital Books, as al&s;o for the tediou&s;ne&s;s as well as additional expence of their Cure, which probably would not in &s;ome In&s;tances have been greater in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There is no &s;tronger In&s;tance of the &s;uperior ad|vantage of being an <HI>In,</HI> to that of being an <HI>Out Pa|tient,</HI> than what is taken from tho&s;e complaints which ari&s;e entirely from the want of proper warmth and nouri&s;hment, and which is often the fate of the Country Poor. I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e in vain
<PB N="14" REF="13">attempted to be relieved at home, who when they came into the hou&s;e &s;carce wanted any other pre|&s;cription than a warm bed and a full belly, and which often compleated their cure in a fortnight.</P>
<P>Nor let it be &s;aid that relief in the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces is rather given to the pari&s;h than to the poor, for di&s;tempers are equally &s;uch, whether brought on by poverty or any other Cau&s;e. Nay &s;uch a &s;ufferer &s;urely de&s;erves double compa&s;&s;ion, who owes his &s;uf|ferings to a neglect he dares not complain of, and yet wants &s;trength of con&s;titution to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Pari&s;hes are often burthened with a numerous Poor; and like the re&s;t of their fellow creatures, there are good and bad among them. It is not ea&s;y for Officers to know the exact merit of each family; it is more likely that to &s;ave them&s;elves trouble, they will lay down one uniform mode of relief, without nicely di&s;tingui&s;hing between them; to which the mode&s;t will ever &s;ubmit without reply, whatever fatal con&s;equences it brings upon their health.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are &s;ome Ca&s;es which cannot bear the clo&s;e air of Wards, but require the purer effluvia of Hills and Country, and the&s;e are of cour&s;e and with propriety refu&s;ed admittance within.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>Thus much is &s;ufficient to explain the different methods of relieving Patients. It remains in the la&s;t place to &s;ay &s;omething of that Behaviour, which we expect from the Paupers to their Benefactors, the rules of which in &s;ome degree are not &s;o convenient as could be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Out Patients as well as In, are required when cured, to attend the Governors at the Board, to re|turn thanks for all favours received, when a little book of prayers or advice is put into their hands, if they or any of their family can read; and they are enjoined to return God thanks the fir&s;t conve|nient opportunity at their re&s;pective places of wor&s;hip for their Cure. Now the regular attendance of Pa|tients from great di&s;tances while under cure has been &s;hewn to be in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, and in many, what they do not like. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it operates much &s;tronger. Per&s;ons of that Educa|tion which is u&s;ually the lot of the illiterate, are more &s;trongly actuated by a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of Pain, than by a &s;en&s;e of gratitude when it is once pa&s;t, e&s;pecially if attended with trouble to them&s;elves; in|deed in bad weather it is not required of them; where it proceeds from an ungrateful temper, no alleviation &s;hould be propo&s;ed: but where it is particularly in|convenient to them on account of the di&s;tance, or other unfavourable circum&s;tances, I think it might
<PB N="16" REF="15">in part be di&s;pen&s;ed with by their returning their thanks to the Charity in the per&s;on of their Phy&s;i|cian, and being by him furni&s;hed with books and cu&s;tomary monitions; by which means too, their Boxes, Gallipots or Phials, would be more punctually returned, than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;ervations may appear trifling at fir&s;t &s;ight, but are of &s;ome importance as connected with another rule, who&s;e natural tendency operates to the di&s;advantage of this unthinking cla&s;s. It is always more de&s;irable to prevent faults, than to puni&s;h them; and an attempt at too much regularity, ge|nerally introduces confu&s;ion. In proportion as you in|troduce allowances and admit exceptions, you get farther removed from, and in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;troy your fir&s;t de&s;ign. It were better to make laws if po&s;&s;ible, of a comprehen&s;ive nature at fir&s;t, that &s;hould virtu|ally include every power which we might in any ca&s;e wi&s;h to exert, than &s;uch as we mu&s;t entirely run counter to, upon every unfore&s;een event.</P>
<P>Now the rea&s;on of an unprofitable or faulty at|tendance of the Out Patients being &s;o numerous, as has been explained, it is difficult to know when to adopt the u&s;ually pre&s;cribed puni&s;hment, of di&s;mi&s;&s;|ing them for this fault, and rendering them incapa|ble of the Benefit of the Ho&s;pital <HI>for ever.</HI> This Interdiction indeed is directed to be taken off, when
<PB N="17" REF="16">they give a proper rea&s;on for their ab&s;ence. That Rea&s;on however &s;ometimes does not come till months after the Patient and his fault are forgotten, and 'tis often very difficult to know whether that Rea&s;on be a true one. It might therefore perhaps be better to &s;ub&s;titute in its place, the obliging per&s;ons to get a fre&s;h recommendation, who have forfeited the rea|&s;onable advantages of the fir&s;t. Their friends to whom they would apply in this ca&s;e, would if they found them faulty reprimand them properly, or re|fu&s;e them, and if innocent, vindicate them much better than they can do them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to make the Country poor un|der&s;tand the formalities, nece&s;&s;ary for their admi&s;&s;ion, they cannot comprehend what recommendation can be wanted to a Chri&s;tian Ho&s;pital, be&s;ides the Pain, the Poverty, or Sores of the Object; all beyond is unintelligible to them, &s;uch as that there mu&s;t be a written or printed Recommendation, &s;igned by a Sub&s;criber, that Sub&s;criber not three months in ar|rear, not having a Patient at the &s;ame time in the Hou&s;e, nor having had more than a certain number, &amp;c. They do not &s;ee how this tends to their im|mediate relief. And indeed the pathetic exclamation of "mu&s;t I go back and die" accompanied with the haggard look of de&s;pair, may well get the better of the be&s;t planned &s;chemes of prudent and provi|dent regulations. But for this difficulty al&s;o I would
<PB N="18" REF="17">&s;ugge&s;t a Remedy, that tho&s;e Sub&s;cribers who live in other Counties, or are never re&s;ident within reach of the Charity to recommend for them&s;elves, &s;hould leave their recommendations in the hands of &s;ome friend who would take care to u&s;e them only for the &s;ervice of proper Objects, when their own recom|mendations and tho&s;e of their neighbours were ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>But it is time to relea&s;e you, for I have made the&s;e ob&s;ervations longer than I intended. I cannot how|ever conclude without doing ju&s;tice to the managers of our mo&s;t excellent Charity. They are ever atten|tive to do all the Good they can with the money ap|propriated for that U&s;e: to do good where they can, with &s;trict Oeconomy, but at all events, to do it. That u&s;eful Charities may ever abound, and that all Charities may be rendered as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible, is the &s;incere prayer of</P>
