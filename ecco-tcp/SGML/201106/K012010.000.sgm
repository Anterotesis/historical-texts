<HEAD>PRELIMINARY INTRODUCTION TO SEA-BATHING.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to inform the READER, that, in compliance with the reque&s;t of &s;ome highly di&s;tingui&s;hed gentlemen of the faculty, I have undertaken to write on the nature, power, influ|ence, and effect of Sea-water and Sea-bathing, cold and hot, and &s;ubmitted the manu&s;cripts to be read before a learned MEDICAL SOCIETY, in <HI>London;</HI> and al&s;o to be reviewed by &s;undry learned medical friends; and the reports on them are highly flattering, but which it may be prudent to conceal till the public opinion is known.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject matter, thus a&s;&s;igned me to &s;ift and handle, is &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting; and &s;tands in
<PB N="4" REF="3">much need of farther inve&s;tigation. Sea-bath|ing is certainly more practi&s;ed, at the pre&s;ent day, than a knowledge of it is yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. There is in it great room to advance, explain, en|force, and re&s;train. What I deliver &s;hall, though connected, be in di&s;tinct tracts, in or|der to relieve the reader, and make them come ea&s;y to the purcha&s;er: the whole will be the re|&s;ult of long practical experience, and the facts &s;upported by re&s;pectable living evidence, of gen|tlemen of the faculty on the coa&s;t, and long-&s;tand|ing &s;agacious &s;ea-bathing guides, male and female, at MARGATE. Where any thing is left doubtful or equivocal, it is for profe&s;&s;ional men, re&s;ident at the &s;ea-watering places, to advance a &s;tep farther, and add to, and refine on, my arguments, and the im|portance of the de&s;ign; and by their being thus faithful interpreters of the hidden trea&s;ures of nature, will manife&s;t them&s;elves to be what they profe&s;s, the <HI>guardians</HI> of health, and the truly adopted &s;ons and heirs of <HI>Apollo,</HI> the Inventor of Medicine. <HI>Divi&s;um &s;ic breve fiet opus.</HI> None el&s;e are, or can be competent to the ta&s;k; as &s;ea|bathing involves in it a knowledge of the animal oeconomy, and of general medical practice, found|ed on ju&s;t phy&s;ical rea&s;oning; call it theory if you will. Experience without nice conception of the truths nece&s;&s;ary, demon&s;trable by rea&s;on, to enable us to draw ju&s;t deductions from the pheno|mena,
<PB N="5" REF="4">for application to particular objects, is no experience at all: it is wor&s;e than none; for it involves in ob&s;curity, and fixes an idea in the mind, narrow in its compa&s;s, hazardous in the en|terprize, and often fal&s;e in the conclu&s;ion; &s;o that it brings nothing to the temple of truth and know|ledge; and, neither promotes, completes, or ac|tuates to new inventions or any u&s;eful di&s;covery of the &s;everal dependencies, cau&s;es, and connexion of things, &s;o far as comes within the ken of human intelligence. All theory beyond this, is as vain and fruitle&s;s as that of &s;imple curs barking and leaping after the wild birds of the &s;ky, or at the light of, and &s;pecks in the moon. There is not the &s;ame <HI>Libertas philo&s;ophica</HI> in <HI>Ars Medica</HI> as in <HI>Licentia poetica</HI> for the flights of fancy. As &s;pe|culative literature is ba&s;ele&s;s, our faith is left free; nothing le&s;s than &s;olid truth can be re&s;ted on; it is the great barrier again&s;t the floods of error, ignorance, and &s;ceptical hypothe&s;is, or fictious &s;o|phi&s;try. In truth, there is certitude, of what is good or bad: in ignorance, diffidence, doubt, and danger.</P>
<Q><L>"So want of knowing truth doth fools delude,</L>
<L>And error from the right way doth exclude,</L>
<L>All tho&s;e that doubt;"&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>HORACE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The <HI>Stoics</HI> e&s;teem him mad who is blindly led by ignorance in&s;tead of truth. Diffidence and ob&s;ti|nacy,
<PB N="6" REF="5">though oppo&s;ite in them&s;elves, are both in the line of defection. Diffidence is no ju&s;t excu&s;e for the concealment of an important fact; others may theorize thereon. Theory helps us out in the knowledge of rea&s;ons and cau&s;es, for &s;ettling our judgments upon the be&s;t and mo&s;t rational prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Theory and practice, like two heavenly bodies, attract light on each other: the one without the other is like the &s;tatue of <HI>Polyphemus</HI> without an eye, or a lamp without oil. Every man hath &s;ome theory or other&mdash;good or bad:&mdash;his cannot be wrong who&s;e practice is uniformly &s;ucce&s;sful: it is in full proof, if actions are allowed to be &s;tronger than words. In &s;trict logic, it is not allowed to pa&s;s from the hypothe&s;is to the the&s;is: the hypo|thetical principle mu&s;t be proved, before the con&s;e|quences can be admitted: opinion mu&s;t be implant|ed, or re&s;olution determined, before rea&s;ons for that opinion can be known: illu&s;tration and ju&s;t repre|&s;entation, by example, is required to enlighten and in&s;truct the under&s;tanding, or the truth of a doctrine cannot be confirmed, or its principles e&s;tabli&s;hed. Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;ays, "As in ma|thematics, &s;o in natural philo&s;ophy, the inve&s;tiga|tion of difficult things, by way of analy&s;is, ought ever to precede the method of compo&s;ition. This analy&s;is con&s;i&s;ts in making experiments and ob|&s;ervations,
<PB N="7" REF="6">and in drawing general conclu&s;ions from them by induction, and admitting of no objections again&s;t the conclu&s;ions, but &s;uch as are taken from experiments and ob&s;ervations, or other certain truths: and although the arguing from experiments and ob&s;ervations by induction, be no demon&s;tration of general conclu&s;ions, yet it is the be&s;t way of rea&s;oning, which the nature of things admit of, and may be looked upon as &s;o much the &s;tronger, by how much the induction is more general: and if no exception occur from phe|nomena, the conclu&s;ion may be pronounced ge|nerally. But if at any time afterwards, any exceptions do occur from experiments, it may be pronounced, with &s;uch exceptions as &s;hall occur. By this way of analy&s;is, we may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and from motions to the forces producing them; and in general from effects to their cau&s;es, and from particular cau&s;es to more general ones, till the argument ends in the mo&s;t general." <HI>Op.</HI> p. 380. l. 31.</P>
<P>The theory required, founded on the light of nature, concerning man, his di&s;ea&s;es, affections, (bodily and mental) dependencies, mutations, di|ver&s;i&s;ications, re&s;i&s;tances, &s;ympathies and antipa|thies, indicating and contra-indicating &s;ymptoms, concordant and di&s;cordant opinions and principles, together with the force and influence of the pla|netary
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;y&s;tem on our orb, is infinite, ob&s;cure, and marvellous to human wi&s;dom, yet does honour to the eternal immutable <HI>Being,</HI> who hath not only created, but pre&s;erveth the variety. There is nothing without its counteracting opponent: there is no di&s;ea&s;e without its antidote: vice, hath virtue: hatred, love: malevolence, charity:&mdash;the|ori&s;ts oppo&s;e; and, by their oppo&s;ing opinions, truth comes out, and the arts and &s;ciences are refined and improved. This &s;y&s;tem of oppo&s;ition is maintained throughout the whole animal and vegetable creation:
<Q><L>"All nature is but art unknown to thee;</L>
<L>All chance, direction, which thou can&s;t not &s;ee;</L>
<L>All di&s;cord, harmony not under&s;tood;</L>
<L>All partial Evil, univer&s;al Good:</L>
<L>And, &s;pite of Pride, in erring Rea&s;on's &s;pite,</L>
<L>One truth is clear, <HI>Whatever is, is Right."</HI></L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>All theories may be referred to the general laws of motion. Sea-bathing comprehends in it the powers and qualities of fluidity, gravity, pre&s;|&s;ure, attraction, repul&s;ion, &s;timulation, friction, at|trition, and velocity; cold, heat, humidity, dry|ne&s;s, effluvia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If what I offer to the public &s;hall meet with a reception equal to the intention, to awaken and per|&s;uade my fellow creatures, upon rational grounds, to keep out of the road that leads to pain, &s;orrow,
<PB N="9" REF="8">and premature death, and embrace health, that ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing which gives reli&s;h to all our enjoyments, my ambition will be amply gratified in being permitted to add my mite to the public fund of pre&s;ervatory knowledge.</P>
<P>Although I write from the locality of my &s;itu|ation, yet the ob&s;ervations I have made, the important facts I have indu&s;triou&s;ly collected, and the dubious points I have more fully a&s;|certained, are &s;o general as to &s;erve equally well for every other eligible &s;ea-bathing place at home or abroad.</P>
<P>Neither the advantages of Sea-bathing, at <HI>Mar|gate,</HI> nor the &s;alubrious property of the air of <HI>Thanet,</HI> have hitherto commanded medical atten|tion equal to what their importance de&s;erve, con&s;equently are not &s;ufficiently known to the public. <HI>Res ip&s;a loquitur.</HI> Sea-bathing has cer|tainly worked its own way more than by any indu&s;try of the <HI>&s;aculty.</HI></P>
<P>During twelve years and upwards that I re&s;ided at KINGSTON, <HI>Surry,</HI> before I came to <HI>Margate,</HI> though I was allowed to be fortunate, under heaven, in relieving pain and di&s;tre&s;s, yet I wi&s;h to throw a veil over my ignorance of the power and effects of <HI>Sea-bathing,</HI> as of tho&s;e I recom|mended
<PB N="10" REF="9">to it, &s;ome returned no better, &s;ome wor&s;e; and &s;ome I &s;ent to the cold &s;ea-bath whom I ought to have &s;ent to the warm, <HI>et vice ver&s;a,</HI> which I candidly acknowledged in my <HI>Medical Remarks</HI> the moment I knew better, wherefore there is but too much room to conclude, that all tho&s;e who returned benefit|ted, were more indebted to chance than to any preci&s;e judgment or theory of mine. I have to plead for it, I was an inland practi&s;er, when all my knowledge of it was derived from the very few practical treati&s;es I had &s;een, or could obtain on the &s;ubject; and neither of tho&s;e I &s;aw were &s;o perfect as to give me adequate ideas of it for practice: &s;ome, in &s;ome things, egre|giou&s;ly mi&s;led me: &s;ome others were mi&s;led them|&s;elves; and it making no part of academical education, my mind was not prompted to con&s;ider the efficacy of Sea-water as any thing beyond that of a mere wa&s;h for a foul &s;kin, whereas there is no part, I will &s;ay, of the whole <HI>materia medica,</HI> yet known &s;o exten&s;ively efficacious, under judi|cious direction, or detrimental, under indi&s;creet, ill-timed management. If it was not capable of doing harm, it would be incapable of doing good.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e &s;imples which dwell the mo&s;t viru|lent poi&s;ons, dwell al&s;o, the mo&s;t potent, &s;alutary virtues:
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<Q><L>"There is &s;ome &s;oul goodne&s;s in things evil,</L>
<L>Would men ob&s;ervingly di&s;til it out."</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The mo&s;t capital things of nature lie generally out of the common track; and, therefore the man who aims at great and u&s;eful di&s;covery, mu&s;t take much upon him&s;elf, for few will follow until the point is fully a&s;certained; and it is well if he does not meet with di&s;couragement for his diligent inquiry.</P>
<P>In proportion to our confidence, proficiency, and enlarged views of nature, &s;o are the mi&s;eries of mankind abridged, and the means are multi|plied for yielding a comfortable exi&s;tence. It is for me, and for every one of us, who under|take the important charge of lives, to open and expand our ideas, for receiving more ample and more enlarged views of the di&s;coverable things of nature, her &s;ilent ways, the di&s;pen&s;ations of pro|vidence, and the exigencies of man; which, if every one did, we &s;hould &s;ee fewer improper objects arrive at the &s;ea-watering places, with very inadequate directions and large packages of compounded drugs, which no rational practi|tioner, phy&s;ician, or apothecary, can act with and under, by which &s;ome have &s;everely &s;uffered, others received no benefit, and the water for&s;ooth,
<PB N="12" REF="11">blamed for what it had no hand in. <HI>Lamentabili dictu!</HI>&mdash;None have fuffered at MARGATE, ex|cept the indi&s;creet and unthinking, or who have been &s;o unfortunate as to be badly advi&s;ed and injudiciou&s;ly directed, no matter whether by tho&s;e on the coa&s;t or inland, who have not yet acquired a competent knowledge of the &s;tate, qualities, powers, order, affinity, and appropriation of the objects of nature to the &s;eminal and radical cau&s;es of di&s;temper, or the patients ability of body to &s;u&s;tain the propo&s;ed means for receiving relief.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved &s;ome to have come, and, under judicious direction, receive much benefit; come a &s;econd time, re&s;ting on their own judgment and experience, and &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are dead and in&s;en&s;ible to all the warm emotions and plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations that re&s;ult from the act of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation&mdash;the <HI>amor &s;ui</HI>&mdash;we cannot expect to re&s;u&s;citate. I &s;ay with <HI>Horace:</HI>
<Q><L>"Let none but learned doctors phy&s;ic give,</L>
<L>Let each mechanic by his calling live."</L></Q></P>
<P>And with <HI>Pliny:</HI>
<Q>"The arts would be happy if only arti&s;ts might judge of them and practi&s;e them."</Q></P>
<P>By an improper application of &s;ea-bathing, through ignorance, the intention of the bath is
<PB N="13" REF="12">fru&s;trated, the &s;ymptoms of a complaint aggra|vated, new fatal ones brought on, and the voice of nature is &s;ilenced. That eloquent, and much enlightened genius, the late Dr. <HI>JOHN MORGAN,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine in the College of <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> in his Anniver&s;ary Di&s;cour&s;e, publi&s;hed in 1765, has the following &s;pirited pa&s;&s;age, which does honour to his humanity.</P>
<P>"Should we," &s;ays he, "for a moment turn our eyes upon the man, who dares to enter upon the practice of phy&s;ic, without being properly initiated into the &s;cience, or in&s;tructed in the important duties of the profe&s;&s;ion, he would &s;oon pre&s;ent us with a melancholy pro&s;pect. If not pa&s;t all feelings of humanity, what compunctions of con&s;cience, what remor&s;e would not fill his brea&s;t from practi&s;ing at random and in the dark; not knowing whether his pre&s;criptions might prove a whole&s;ome remedy or a de&s;tructive poi&s;on. To di&s;cover the nature of an uncommon di&s;ea&s;e, or to account for an unu&s;ual &s;ymptom, puzzles his invention.&mdash;Ignorant of every true principle, from which, by ju&s;t rea&s;oning, he might be able to deduce practical inferences, he knows not what progno&s;tic to make, or what plan of treatment to ob&s;erve&mdash;Un&s;teady and irre&s;olute, he attempts a variety of means; &s;uch as either avail not, or &s;uch as heighten the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e, already too
<PB N="14" REF="13">violent, he may thus interrupt the &s;alutary at|tempts of nature, or, not knowing how to &s;econd them, tamper with the life of the patient, and idly waiting to &s;ee what nature her&s;elf is capable of doing, neglect to &s;uccour her, till it is too late, and the fatal hand of death is ju&s;t clo&s;ing the gloomy &s;cene.&mdash;Wretched is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e whom chance, or mi&s;informed judgment, &s;hall throw into his hands, to fall victims of his te|merity&mdash;Great is the havock which his ignorance &s;preads on every &s;ide, robbing the affectionate hu&s;band of his darling &s;pou&s;e, or rendering the tender wife a helple&s;s widow;&mdash;increa&s;ing the number of orphans;&mdash;mercile&s;&s;ly depriving them of their parents &s;upport;&mdash;bereaving the afflicted parents of their only comfort and hope, by the untimely death of their beloved infants, and lay|ing whole families de&s;olate. Remor&s;ele&s;s &s;oe to human kind! Actuated by more than &s;avage cru|elty! Hold, hold, thy exterminating hand!&mdash;</P>
<P>"Glad &s;hould I be to moderate this too exact de&s;cription of the effects of ignorant and pre|&s;umptuous practice; but what judgment can we pa&s;s on tho&s;e, who have been &s;carcely in&s;tructed in the fir&s;t elements of medical &s;cience, and yet force them&s;elves into practice, as if they meant to &s;port them&s;elves with human life and human ca|lamities?"</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>If medicine be allowed to be a great ble&s;&s;ing in the hands of the &s;agacious and wi&s;e, and as a &s;word in the hands of the fooli&s;h and furious, &s;o is &s;ea-bathing. Too much being a&s;&s;umed and taken for granted, is the rea&s;on &s;o little progre&s;s has hitherto been made in its theory for guiding the hand of practice. The greate&s;t enemy to wi&s;dom and prudence is precipitation.</P>
<P>Nine years ago I happened to come to MAR|CATE in que&s;t of &s;trength, after a long and &s;evere fever; and receiving a very &s;en&s;ible benefit the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on by &s;ea-bathing, and the &s;alubrious air of <HI>Thanet,</HI> I was thereon led to make inquiry into their &s;pecial effects on other vi&s;itors, and what I actually &s;aw, and was credibly informed of by &s;ome of the bathing guides, I thought important, and it not being generally known, I immediately pub|li&s;hed it in my <HI>Medical Remarks on Evacuations.</HI> Since that time, I have had frequent opportunity of ob&s;erving more minutely their effects on others under various &s;tates, circum&s;tances, and conditions of body: in &s;imple and complicated, acute and chronic, ca&s;ual and inherent complaints; and every year's experience gives manifold proofs of their very great utility to health: they re&s;tore and pre|&s;erve. There are but few di&s;tempers incident to human nature in which either the cold, the warm, or vapour &s;ea-water bath, and the air of a &s;alu|brious &s;pot on the margin of the main, &s;uch as
<PB N="16" REF="15"><HI>Thanet,</HI> are not equal to meet and prove more or le&s;s beneficial in. I have &s;een, on a well di|rected cour&s;e, di&s;ea&s;es not only palliated, but many cured by them, after having baffled the power of medicine in rational arti&s;ts hands. The&s;e baths are certainly mo&s;t excellent auxiliaries to medi|cine, diet, exerci&s;e, and amu&s;ement, as the&s;e are to them, which accounts for the great flux and re-flux of company, from the king to the beggar, to, and from the &s;ea-watering places, during the temperate &s;ea&s;ons;
<Q>"Where Baths give vigour and the Waters health."</Q></P>
<P>Or, as a late ingenious MARGATE vi&s;itant to mount <HI>Parna&s;sus</HI> de&s;cribes it;
<Q><L>"The briny wave doth thou&s;ands &s;ave,</L>
<L>Alike from Grave and Crutches;</L>
<L>Makes Aged young, the feeble &s;trong,</L>
<L>Or Beggar, Duke, or Duche&s;s."</L>
<BIBL>COLEMAN.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Sea-water is not a mere &s;imple homogeneous elemental fluid <HI>&s;implex &s;implicitur,</HI> but nature's richly &s;aturated compound. It contains, &s;ay che|mical philo&s;ophers, a muriatic bitter purging &s;alt, calcarious earth, and &s;ulphureous bitumen: and <HI>Boyle,</HI> and other naturali&s;ts agree in there being a &s;ubtle aetherial &s;pirit in water, which &s;ome call fixed air, &s;ome phlogi&s;ton or inflammable air, be&s;ides a pure air, which airs become ela&s;tic, as &s;een by the &s;parkling air bubbles.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>The proportion of the principles of &s;ea-water vary in &s;ome di&s;tant &s;eas, and in deep and in &s;hallow water: &s;ome &s;ay the &s;ea is more &s;alt in &s;ummer than in winter, warmer in a tempe&s;t than in a calm. There is in &s;ea-water, be&s;ides its ori|ginal native principles, the impregnation of &s;ub|marine plants, &s;uch as the <HI>Quercus Marinus,</HI> or &s;ea-wreck, and other plants; the &s;lime, &s;perm, and excrementitious parts of fi&s;hes; their, and other dead bodies, rain, dew, hail, &s;now, &s;prings, and the di&s;emboguing of rivers and ponds; together with fo&s;&s;ils, minerals, and the refu&s;e of &s;hips, &amp;c. the combination of all which heterogeneous par|ticles render &s;ea-water, on &s;tagnation and being clo&s;e kept, quickly corruptible. After a long calm at &s;ea the &s;tench is very offen&s;ive, and that which i&s;&s;ues forth on opening a ca&s;k of &s;ea-water, that has been kept for &s;ome time in the hold of a &s;hip, is intolerable, nay deadly. If it were not for the tides there would be no living near the &s;ea in a calm. As the aerial &s;pirit in waters is extremely fugitive, they are all better drank on the &s;pot than at a di&s;|tance, and the more they are crowded with their principles they &s;poil the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-beach on the coa&s;t of <HI>Thanet</HI> is made up of fine &s;and, intermixed with chalk that breaks off from the cliffs after inten&s;e long continued fro&s;t, and is melted by the flowing tides: tho&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="17">cliffs that gave to <HI>Britain</HI> the ancient name of <HI>Albion:</HI>
<Q><L>"That pale, that white-faced &s;hore,</L>
<L>Who&s;e foot &s;purns back th' ocean's roaring tides."</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Thus, there is a bottom that is remarkably clean, &s;oft, &s;mooth, yet invariably firm and gently &s;loping from the fending banks, which render <HI>Thanet</HI>'s coa&s;t very inviting to bathe.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-water at MARGATE is not only pure, but &s;trong of its native principles, by rea&s;on no rivers run into the ocean to make it muddy and bracki&s;h nearer than the <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Medway,</HI> both thirty miles to the we&s;tward, and the&s;e re|pelled back again by the flood tide.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t three or four years I &s;tood a mere &s;pectator and inquirer into the power, influence, and effects of &s;ea-bathing before ever I thought my&s;elf competent to direct a cour&s;e of it: it was to me a new &s;tudy, though an ancient practice; for <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that <HI>Uly&s;ses</HI> and his comrades bathed in warm water and in the &s;ea to refre&s;h them&s;elves after fatigue, before they dined. He mentions purifyng the <HI>Atrides</HI> in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Although we have the te&s;timony and &s;uffrage of &s;ome of the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers and &s;age phy|&s;icians,
<PB N="19" REF="18">in the different ages of the world, for the cold &s;pring and &s;oft tepid baths being the mo&s;t uni|ver&s;al remedies in the whole compa&s;s of nature; yet in a medicinal light they are far, very far inferior in efficacy to the warm and cold &s;ea-water baths, only they are not &s;o convenient or &s;o ea&s;y for all, at all times, to come at. If few &s;peak for, few &s;peak again&s;t them, becau&s;e they are not compe|tent of their power and effects; and, if they are not of their ill as well as good, we cannot take their &s;ilence to be &s;uffrage.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I met with much difficulty in obtaining intelligence; for the faculty, and the &s;ea-bathing guides at MARGATE, all told me they never had been put on the line of ob&s;erving; for, if they had, they &s;aid they could have furni&s;hed me with many important facts of the power and effect, both good and ill, of &s;ea-bathing:
<Q><L>"They build on &s;ands, which unmov'd they find,</L>
<L>'Tis becau&s;e there was no wind."</L>
<BIBL>COWLEY.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And my not meeting with a &s;crip on the &s;ubject in any of the libraries that afforded me the lea&s;t &s;a|tisfaction, I had to per&s;evere in wading through thick &s;hades of darkne&s;s till I came into fair light, when I clearly &s;aw the impropriety of their re|ceiving all that came without exeeption, as if &s;ea-bathing
<PB N="20" REF="19">was an univer&s;al &s;overeign &s;pecific remedy for all complaints, whatever were their nature or cau&s;e; was proper at all times, and &s;uited to all con&s;titutions, temperaments, &s;tates, and conditions of body, modes of living; and that by one mode of bathing only, and of pu&s;hing the bath indi&s;crimi|nately beyond what nature can bear. Can there be any error, theoretical or practical, more ab&s;urd or unphilo&s;ophical? Art is &s;ub&s;ervient to nature; to relieve, poli&s;h, and improve nature. If nature and art do not go hand in hand, and mutually accord, nothing will be perfected or e&s;tabli&s;hed in any art or &s;cience. Nature will be led, but not driven.</P>
<P>Although many di&s;coveries are made in natural hi&s;tory, yet many are &s;till to make, and the point of view nece&s;&s;ary to place many things in for a ju&s;t application is &s;till much wanting, defective, and but imperfectly under&s;tood. This we may apply to &s;ea-bathing as much as to any part of medical practice. When we talk of &s;ea-bathing being efficacious in this, or in that complaint, we mu&s;t mean to comprehend with it the &s;tate and condition of body at the time it has to operate upon. The cold &s;pring and &s;oft tepid baths may almo&s;t wholly be referred to <HI>&s;trictum</HI> and <HI>laxum,</HI> even the <HI>Sainted Wells,</HI> in which they are very powerful.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<P>Having &s;even years ago cautioned the MAR|GATE bathing guides again&s;t receiving any ailing per&s;ons, except with, and by the &s;uf|frage of the faculty; and the guides them|&s;elves &s;eeing the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">priety of this, from &s;ome un|fortunate accidents that happened that &s;ea&s;on and before, to improper and unprepared per&s;ons; to &s;ome of whom I had been called, but too late in &s;ome in&s;tances for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t to re&s;tore; I have not &s;een or heard of any &s;ince &s;uffering violence by &s;ea-bathing. I had no other way to prevent embarra&s;&s;ment that might in future acrue to ignorant and mi&s;led per&s;ons. The guides were not to blame; they were not competent, and their bread depends wholly on the multiplicity that bathe. We mu&s;t rather impute to vi&s;itors them&s;elves neglecting to apply for proper advice on the &s;pot, which the poore&s;t per&s;on that comes recommended may have. The French have a true &s;aying of the Engli&s;h in re&s;pect to their health, which is, "that they do not think them&s;elves &s;ick &s;oon enough, and they think them&s;elves well too &s;oon."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding of the many drawbacks on &s;ea-bathing, whil&s;t the bountiful ocean an&s;wers the peremptory demands of thou&s;ands and tens of thou|&s;ands of proper claiments every year, it mu&s;t ever be &s;olicited aad embraced by the &s;ons and daugh|ters of affliction.

<P>A generous cordial to a per&s;on fainting and &s;atigued, is a comfortable reviving thing, but fiery ardent &s;pirit to one with a hot &s;tomach and in|flamed blood, is adding fuel to the fire, or like giving a man a &s;oporiferous draught in a le|thargy. How often, alas! have I &s;een the mi&s;ery of a di&s;order thus confirmed by injudicious, ill|timed admini&s;tration, that a judicious phy&s;ician would, by quite an oppo&s;ite treatment, have ea&s;ily &s;ubdued. How often, on the other hand, have I rejoicingly beheld many a valuable life, that had been di&s;paired of by one &s;et of men, re&s;tored &s;peedily by others, who attended more minutely to the nice di&s;criminating circum&s;tances of nature, for facilitating the means &s;he u&s;es in her conflict with death. Though fifteen or twenty years &s;ince, &s;ome of the&s;e live u&s;eful members of &s;ociety; yet
<PB N="23" REF="22">how few are the&s;e, comparatively &s;peaking, to the number of drowned per&s;ons re&s;tored annually to life by the Humane Society, after vital action in the heart, arteries and re&s;piratory organs, had, for almo&s;t an incredible length of time, been &s;u&s;|pended? And al&s;o to the number of great cures performed in our ho&s;pitals, after the complaints had baffled the art of &s;agacious private practi&s;ers? which &s;hews the advantage of art where rational men of the faculty have &s;trict ju&s;tice done to their practice:</P>
<Q>Hoc e&s;t Vivere bis po&s;se priore frui.</Q>
<P>Every in&s;tance of re&s;u&s;citation corroborates to &s;erve as a &s;pur to us not to abandon nature too &s;oon in her difficulties, when we every day &s;ee what &s;he is capable of doing for giving relief in di&s;tre&s;s, with a little judicious well-timed help: but though the benignant hand of providence continues to anticipate on many occa&s;ions, the interpo&s;ition of art by effecting her own work; yet men of judgment, under&s;tanding, experience, and ob&s;ervation, know that &s;he is frequently inter|rupted and retarded therein by the officious hands of ignorance, temerity, and profe&s;&s;ional <HI>juglers.</HI></P>
<Q>"An hone&s;t man's the noble&s;t work of God."</Q>
<P>Per&s;everence in doing good to our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow creatures is the crown and perfection of all
<PB N="24" REF="23">virtues: every other principle of virtue attends it. If there are any ulcered &s;ouls that think this a bur|then, or a drawback on trade, let not their judg|ment counteract or &s;ilence the voice of nature&mdash; the will of their <HI>creator</HI> and <HI>pre&s;erver.</HI> Let them con&s;ider, if the world was made for <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> it was for <HI>Titus</HI> too.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e only who are in familiar habits with na|ture, can know any thing of her ways and the methods &s;he takes in cau&s;ing, and carrying off di&s;ea&s;e, and purifying the blood of noxious par|ticles, that a&s;&s;ociate with the ma&s;s and bear down the fabric. The art is not to render the blood by the remedy in a wor&s;e &s;tate than it found it; which every medicine will do if injudiciou&s;ly u&s;ed, and the mo&s;t potent one too the &s;oone&s;t.</P>
<P>To treat a di&s;ea&s;e rationally, it is not only ne|ce&s;&s;ary to know the remedy, but the natural con|&s;titution and acquired diathe&s;is of the blood it has to act upon. The &s;agacious phy&s;ician has many &s;igns and tokens given him for his guide in the local and univer&s;al complaint; even the a&s;pect of the countenance on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s &s;erves to enable him to make a genuine pre&s;age of the i&s;&s;ue. This is called the <HI>&s;emiotic</HI> or art of pre&s;aging by exterior &s;igns. The di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;titution, &s;tate, and nature's indications (&s;alutary and erroneous)
<PB N="25" REF="24">being known, &s;he in&s;tantly pre&s;ents to his en|lightened mind what is calculated for oppo&s;ing the morbid &s;ymptoms, and bringing relief out of the abundant &s;tock from his exten&s;ive re&s;earches, un|der the protection of an all-attentive providence, without being to&s;&s;ed on the fluctuating wave of conjectural opinion or uncertainty: thus experi|ence founded on analogy and comparative fact, imparts her ob&s;ervations to rea&s;on, and enables it to &s;upport, by fair evidence, &s;olid conclu&s;ions again&s;t the common enemy <HI>ignorance,</HI> which &s;aps the foundation, and undermines all genuine learn|ing. Example hath the force of command.</P>
<P>Scientific principles certainly re&s;t on <HI>praecognita,</HI> fixed, leading, or &s;tanding &s;elf-evident axioms, which are the objects of our &s;en&s;es&mdash;come within the &s;phere or cognizance of our intellectual facul|ties, and are con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and truth: on the&s;e &s;cience is enlarged and improved. Medi|cal &s;cience being the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of any, it taking in the whole compa&s;s and domain of nature, many things are yet beyond the amplitude of our intellectual view; and therefore its &s;upporting pil|lars cannot all be reckoned, and our philo&s;ophy has not taught us to reduce infinite variety to di|finite limitation without lo&s;s. How narrow and un&s;table all the &s;y&s;tems of medical theory yet ex|tant! every one having been &s;o &s;ullied by the
<PB N="26" REF="25">improvements of the &s;ucceeding generation, that there is not one that has yet &s;tood the te&s;t of half a century. HIPPOCRATES' <HI>(pater no&s;ter artes me|dicoe)</HI> excepted, which will &s;tand as long as nature is true to her&s;elf: upon it we may make new ac|que&s;ts every day, it having endle&s;s &s;tore to improve on, but upon none el&s;e that I know. How &s;hort and fluctuating the College Catalogue of remedies to natures plan of the <HI>materia medica,</HI> as if all the re&s;t beyond it were an u&s;ele&s;s ma&s;s of rubbi&s;h, only fit for being ca&s;t away, while <HI>Deus et natura nihil fa|eiunt fru&s;tra.</HI> CICERO, in his Academicks, &s;peaks almo&s;t in the&s;e words: "I do not direct my thoughts to the little bear but the great bear, called <HI>Helice</HI> or <HI>Charles' wain,</HI> tho&s;e famous <HI>&s;even north &s;tars;</HI> that is, my ideas are to be enlarged, not narrowed, and therefore I mu&s;t wander and expatiate a great deal farther. Ab&s;olute re&s;triction is giving at once an effectual check to the &s;pirit of inquiry, and locking up the human under&s;tanding in the dark vale of ignorance. The mo&s;t enlightened genius, with every advantage, knows but in part; and all that phy&s;icians do, or can know of nature, may be re|&s;olved into principles of ob&s;ervation and phy&s;ical fact. Their re&s;earches and di&s;qui&s;itions into oc|cult and in&s;crutable paths; &s;uch as primordial ef|ficient cau&s;es and inbred virtues, or to unravel that combination of cau&s;es which we call chance, more e&s;pecially &s;uper-natural cau&s;es and their influences,
<PB N="27" REF="26">would be fruitle&s;s, vain, arrogant, and bewildering, if not irreverent, that being nature it&s;elf; and na|ture is the art of the GODHEAD.</P>
<Q><L>The dark profundity of heav'ns high plan,</L>
<L>Is known to angels, but conceal'd from man.</L></Q>
<P>It is well if we can obtain a &s;ide glance, or a pa&s;&s;ing &s;mile.</P>
<P>Though much remains to be di&s;covered before we arrive at the <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> yet enough is di&s;|covered of things and their virtues, to enable the human mind to form ju&s;t ideas of the infinite wi&s;dom, power, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s of the great GOD of univer&s;al nature, who&s;e benificence pours forth and di&s;clo&s;es his ble&s;&s;ings to every living thing, conducted by fixed and immutable laws, and the rule and order of his di&s;pen&s;ation is the felicity of the <HI>univer&s;e.</HI></P>
<Q><L>In every flow'r that blooms, or &s;hrub that grows,</L>
<L>The GODHEAD &s;miles triumphant o'er his FOES.</L></Q>
<P>Or, as LUCRETIUS more fully has it;
<Q><L>"God is in &s;ea, and land, and air, and &s;ky,</L>
<L>What would we more, all is DEITY.</L>
<L>Whate'er we &s;ee, or where&s;oe'er we go,</L>
<L>We mu&s;t &s;ee GOD, whether we will or no."</L></Q></P>
<P>After what is &s;aid in this preliminary di&s;|cour&s;e, it will appear evident to the rational
<PB N="28" REF="27">READER, that ina&s;much as it is for phy&s;icians, and their brethren of the faculty, at the &s;ea-watering places to explore and indu&s;triou&s;ly acquire a com|petent knowledge of the nature, power, influence, and effect of &s;ea-bathing, and its e&s;&s;ential &s;up|porting auxilliaries for the relief of pain, agony, and di&s;tre&s;s; it is for <HI>vi&s;itors</HI> them&s;elves not to be too indolent or refractory, to taking, and being guided by rea&s;on and judicious coun&s;el on the &s;pot, not only previous to, but from time to time, during a cour&s;e of bathing, to prevent embar|ra&s;&s;ment, and to allow the bath to have fair play for an&s;wering the end and intention of it; for no writer can lay down rules to an&s;wer all and every one's ca&s;e invariably; therefore to act laudably and gain &s;ucce&s;s is the triumph of wi&s;dom; it is the way to be acquainted with nature:
<Q><L>"Know all the good that individuals find,</L>
