<P>THOUGH <HI>Walton</HI> Water, is here held out, as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Properties and Medicinal Powers as <HI>Chel|tenham</HI> Water, it is not done with the mo&s;t di&s;tant View, to le&s;&s;en the Reputation of that Water, and the Re&s;ort to <HI>Cheltenham.</HI> On the contrary, it is pre&s;umed, it will be a Satisfaction to Invalids to be a&s;&s;ured of having within a &s;mall Di&s;tance, a Water of the &s;ame Kind, to which recour&s;e may be had, when the Numbers are &s;o great at <HI>Chelten|ham,</HI> as to be in&s;ufficiently &s;upplied from the Well there.</P>

<P><HI>Tewke&s;bury,</HI> however, has equally a Right to the Benefit of its natural Riches, and to the Advantages which may accrue to it from the Vicinity of <HI>Walton</HI> Waters in particular.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT length, I &s;end you, an ac|count of the Experiments, made on the Medicinal Water near Tewke&s;bury, of which, &s;o much has been &s;aid at Cheltenham, in the cour&s;e of this Sea&s;on and the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I FIRST heard of this Water in pa&s;&s;ing through Tewke&s;bury in 1786. It had been for &s;ome time re|&s;orted to, by Per&s;ons in the Neighbourhood, and, was reported to have effected Cures in the Di&s;ea&s;es for which Cheltenham Water is &s;ound to be &s;o effica|cious, and, on account of which, Per&s;ons of every Rank, re&s;ort to that Place in &s;uch Numbers, as to exhau&s;t &s;ometimes the Spring on which they re&s;t their hopes of recovery.</P>
<P>THIS Well is &s;ituated near Walton, a Village about a mile from Tewke&s;bury, upon an E&s;tate be|longing to Nicholas Smith&s;end, E&s;quire. The Ground about the Well is a deep Clay Soil, under which, at the depth of about &s;even or eight yards, runs a Stratum of blue &s;laty Stone; on piercing this Bed of Stone, plentiful Springs of Water ari&s;e, which are always more or le&s;s impregnated with Salt.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>THE Well, of which I write, is about twenty feet deep.</P>
<P>THE Water from the Pump, or &s;oon after, hasa &s;oft, almo&s;t Oleaginous ta&s;te, numerous Air Bubbles ri&s;e, and &s;parkle in the Gla&s;s; after it has been drank, it leaves the Chalybeate, and Saline ta&s;tes on the tongue, and when &s;hook in the Bottle, the He|patic &s;mell is very perceptible.</P>
<P>ITS re&s;emblance in ta&s;te, and other appearances to the Cheltenham Water, &s;trikes every one who makes the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>ITS operation on the Body, al&s;o, is exactly the &s;ame, a Pint or more, acts as a gentle Laxative and Diuretic: And it occa&s;ions a &s;light giddine&s;s in &s;ome per&s;ons, in others a &s;ort of heavy pain in the head.</P>
<P>THESE te&s;ts, though of them&s;elves, &s;ufficiently convincing, will be confirmed by the Experiments which I made on the Walton Water, in the Summer of 1786, and this Summer, in which I had the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the worthy Surgeons and Apothecaries, at Tewke&s;bury. 1. When the Walton Water is mix|ed with Clear &s;iltered Lime Water, it becomes im|mediately cloudy, and, a copious white &s;caly preci|pitation en&s;ues.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cloudy appearance ari&s;es in Lime Wa|ter, when the Air, &s;eparated by Heat from the Wal|ton Water, is conveyed by a Pipe and Bladder, con|nected
<PB N="7" REF="6">with the two Bottles, into the Bottle, con|taining the Lime Water, and &s;haken with it.</P>
<P>IF the Walton Water has been taken from the Well, twelve or more hours, the precipitation by Lime Water, does not take place immediately, in the manner it does in a Gla&s;s of Water from the Pump.</P>
<P>WHITE Ar&s;enic, di&s;&s;olves more readily in the Walton Water, than in common Water, and ren|ders the Hepatic &s;mell thereof, &s;tronger and more perceptible.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN Walton Water, fre&s;h from the Pump, is mixed with an Infu&s;ion of Green Tea, the mixture a&s;&s;umes a Purple Colour, and by &s;tanding, the Co|lour becomes deeper,</P>
<P N="3">3. SOLUTION of Saccharum Saturni, mixed with fre&s;h drawn Water, becomes brown, and is followed by a blacki&s;h precipitation. This is a te&s;t of the pre|&s;ence of Hepatic Air, which al&s;o di&s;covers it&s;elf in this Water, by its characteri&s;tic Sulphureous &s;mell. This often is produced by putrifying Vegetables. Bi&s;hop Wat&s;on, ob&s;erves, that Sulphureous Waters are produced in Mora&s;&s;es and Bogs, from rotten Wood; that Shale, a &s;tone &s;o called, of which there is a Stratum, extended all over the Country about Harrowgate, and from which the Sulphur Springs there ari&s;e, contains both Vitriolic Acid and Phlo|gi&s;ton, the con&s;tituent parts of Sulphur; and &s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="7">pieces of Shale, when calcined properly, have been found to communicate the Sulphureous impregnation to Water, Ph. Tran&s;. 1786. It is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that Walton Water emerges from a bed of &s;tone, and, of a blue Sulphureous &s;oft Pyrites, pro|bably &s;imilar to this, and that the Soil abounds with the remains of rotten Vegetables re&s;olved into it, and that from one or both the&s;e &s;ources, it derives the Hepatic Gas perceived in it.</P>
<P>THE blue Sulphureous Pyrites found in digging the Ground in the Field belonging to the Well-hou&s;e near Walton, has exactly the &s;ame appearance and properties as that dug, to make a New Well, near Fauconberg-hou&s;e, by order of his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="4">4. AFTER Walton Water has been drawn from the Pump ten or twelve hours; it no longer becomes purple or blacki&s;h, by the addition of a&s;tringents, (No. II.) and a precipitation with Lime Water, does not immediately en&s;ue, (No. I.)</P>
<P N="5">5. ITS Colour neither becomes Green nor Red, with Syrup of Violets.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT does not efferve&s;ce with the Vitriolic or Nitrous Acids.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT becomes milky by mixture, with the fixed Alkali, and more &s;o with the Volatile Alkali pre|pared with Lime.</P>
<P N="8">8. SOLUTION of Silver, makes it milky and a fla|ky precipitation &s;ub&s;ides.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P N="9">9. TWO ingenious friends, and accurate ob&s;ervers, found the whole fixed contents of the Water left by evaporation, amounted to one ounce in a gallon.</P>
<P N="10">10 AFTER various evaporations, I found it yield|ed exactly that quantity.</P>
<P>WHEN a Gallon of the Water is reduced by eva|poration to two ounces and under, a con&s;iderable quantity of an earthy powder remains in the ve&s;&s;el in which it was boiled. And when the liquid is &s;et to cry &s;talli&s;e, Cry&s;tals, in &s;hape and &s;ize, re&s;embling the Vitriolated Magne&s;ia are formed. They are hexa|gonal, and when dried in the Sun, are calcined into a white powder. The ta&s;te cool and bitter.</P>
<P>SOME cubical Cry&s;tals of marine &s;alt, and a de|lique&s;cent bitter lixivium remain.</P>
<P>THE powder, dropped by boiling in the ve&s;&s;el, con&s;i&s;ts of Magne&s;ia, and an ab&s;orbent earth, which entirely di&s;&s;olve in Vinegar, with con&s;iderable e&s;&s;er|ve&s;cence.</P>
<P>THE quantity of large Cry&s;tals amounted to &s;ix drachms or more, from a Gallon of Water, evapo|rated in 1786; but, by after experiments, I find this impregnation is not con&s;tantly in the &s;ame quantity, and proportion.</P>
<P N="11">11. LASTLY, the Cry&s;tals of the Walton Water, and, the white powder into which the&s;e dried Cry|&s;tals &s;all, when di&s;&s;olved, the Solution is again per|fect, and clear in an exceedingly &s;mall quantity of Water.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>SALT of Tartar, added to this Solution, becomes Milky, and a copious white &s;ediment &s;ub&s;ides, &s;ound to be Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>LIME Water added to the Solution, occa&s;ions a Milky whitene&s;s, and a &s;oft Alkaline precipitation, but it does not happen near &s;o &s;oon as that made by falt of Tarter.</P>

<HEAD>SOME FARTHER EXPERIMENTS On WALTON WATER, Made in NOVEMBER, 1787, By JOHN JOHNSTONE, <HI>B. A.</HI> Of MERTON COLLEGE, OXFORD.</HEAD>
<P>THE Water, on which the following Experi|ments were tried, had been drawn from the Spring &s;everal weeks before it was u&s;ed. And though it was conveyed from Walton to Birmingham in Bottle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well corked and covered with Wax, yet the appear|ances which re&s;ult from the pre&s;ence of the Volatile Ingredients are not to be expected in the&s;e Experi|ments.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Water did not immediately become Pur|ple with Tincture of Galls, but by &s;tanding it con|tracted a du&s;ky greeni&s;h colour with a variegate Pellicle at the top.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P N="2">2. PHLOGISTICATED Alkali did not occa&s;ion any change of the colour in the Water.</P>
<P>THE fixed Air having e&s;caped, the Iron was pre|cipitated, and of cour&s;e could not exhibit tho&s;e Ap|pearances which it did in the Experiments made by my Father at the Spring.</P>
<P N="3">3. SYRUP of Violets made it of a light green Co|lour, Tincture of Turn&s;ole became brown when mixed with it. Tincture of Brazil Wood gave it a blue ca&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Appearances produced by the&s;e three Precipi|tants were occa&s;ioned either by Magne&s;ia or Alkali, di&s;engaged by the e&s;cape of the fixed Air.</P>
<P N="4">4. ACID of Sugar di&s;covered Lime, by precipita|ting it in the form of a white Powder.</P>
<P N="5">5. SALITED Terra Pondero&s;a, by attracting the Vitriolic Acid, occa&s;ioned a white turbidne&s;s in this Water.</P>
<P N="6">6. NITRATED Silver &s;hewed the pre&s;ence of Ma|rine Acid; its attraction for it producing a white Cloud, which on &s;tanding, became of a black colour.</P>
<P N="7">7. AN Alkali, very copiou&s;ly precipitated a white Powder, which appeared to be Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>BY &s;everal Experiments, a quart of the Walton Water yielded, on Evaporation, 120&frac12; grains.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE re&s;idue of a Quart of this Water, was fir&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="11">mixed with Alcohol, which took up 6 &frac12; grains of it. This, by its delique&s;cing in the air, was found to con|&s;i&s;t of Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P N="2">II. Di&s;tilled Water di&s;&s;olved 105 grains of it. As I could not cry&s;talli&s;e the whole, I cannot tell the proportion of each Salt, but I had rea&s;on, both from what did cry&s;talli&s;e, and from Experiment, to &s;uppo&s;e, that Vitriolated Magne&s;ia is the mo&s;t abun|dant in this Water. A quantity of Alcohol, &s;uffici|ent to precipitate the Ba&s;es of tho&s;e Salts in which there was Vitriolic Acid, was mixed with a pint of Walton Water. A copious Precipitation en&s;ued, which on examination proved to be Magne&s;ia alone. For on adding Syrup of Violets to the Magne&s;ia in di&s;tilled Water, no evidence of Alkali appeared more than what Magne&s;ia would alone have given.</P>
<P>To a quart of Walton Water was added a quantity of Vegetable Alkali &s;ufficient to precipitate all the Magne&s;ia. When the Precipitation was over, the whole was &s;iltered, and the Water &s;et to cry&s;talli&s;e. The Cry&s;tals in general, were tho&s;e of Vitriolated Tartar, and a few re&s;embling tho&s;e of Glauber's Salts appeared. A very &s;mall quantity remained un|cry&s;talli&s;ed, which perhaps, was common Salt.</P>
<P N="3">III. DISTILLED Vinegar was mixed with what the Water left, and took up 5 &frac12; grains of it. On Examination this proved to be Lime. It had a re|markable pungent ta&s;te, did not delique&s;ce in the Air, and formed on the Addition of Vitriolic Acid, a kind of Gyp&s;um.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P N="4">IV. AN Alkali dimini&s;hed the remainder 1 &frac12; grain. I could not exactly tell what the Alkali took up here, but it &s;eemed to be a kind of Argillaccous Earth.</P>
<P N="5">V. THE Alkali left nearly 1 &frac12; grain of a black looking Earth. This was mixed with diluted Ma|rine Acid, which di&s;&s;olved nearly the whole of it. Phlogi&s;ticated Alkali, dropped into the Solution, immediately produced a very bright blue Colour. I therefore concluded that the grain and very &s;mall quantity more which the Marine Acid had di&s;&s;olved was Iron. The &s;mall quantity of Earth which did not di&s;&s;olve in the Acid, as it re&s;i&s;ted all the above mixtures, I concluded to be Siliceous Earth.</P>

<P>CHELTENHAM Water (of which I had a few Bot|tles) exhibited the &s;ame appearances with Precipi|tants, only in &s;ome in&s;tances they were more &s;triking.</P>
<P>A QUART of Cheltenham Water yielded, on Eva|poration, 127 grains. I tried the Experiments with Alcohol and Vegetable Alkali, on Cheltenham, with the &s;ame Appearances as with Walton Water, only a large Cry&s;tal of Glauber's Salt appeared in the Ve&s;&s;el with the Alcohol.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="experiment">
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENT 1.</HEAD>
<P>SHEWS Walton Water abounds with fixed Air. Lime becomes quick, calcined or cau&s;tic, by the ex|pul&s;ion of this Air by fire; and being attracted again from this Water, the Calcareous Matter before held in Solution, becomes mild and precipitates in form of a clear and white powder. The immediate pre|cipitation, which takes place by the mixture of Wal|ton Water with Lime Water, and &s;till more clearly the Air forced from Walton Water agitated with Lime Water, is therefore a certain te&s;t of the pre|&s;ence of fixed Air in Walton Water.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY this experiment, Iron in a &s;mall quantity, appears to be one of the &s;ugitive ingredients in the Walton Water. This, as well as &s;ome ab&s;orbent earth, is kept in a di&s;&s;olved &s;tate by the fixed Air and the Sulphureous Gas contained in it: When the fixed Air flies off, which it does much &s;ooner than the Hepatic Gas, the Iron precipitates, and the Wa|ter is no longer capable of becoming Purple by a&s;tringents. The action of heat carries off the He|patic Gas, which appears to hold the ab&s;orbent earths in Solution, which are left by evaporation; and to which the &s;oft, almo&s;t oleaginous ta&s;te, with which this Water &s;trikes the tongue, is probably owing.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P N="3">3. THE addition of Saccharum Saturni di&s;covers the pre&s;ence of the Hepatic Air, another fugitive principle contained in this Water, as well as that of Cheltenham: But it is much le&s;s fugitive than fixed Air, being often perceived, both in the Cheltenham and Walton Waters, after they have been bottled a con&s;iderable time. This Sulphureous or Hepatic Air, found in this and in other Waters, has been the occa&s;ion of much controver&s;y among the Gentle|men who have analy&s;ed Waters: Mr. Kirwan, has, probably finally, &s;ettled the di&s;pute, by &s;hewing that Hepatic Air is no other, than actual Sulphur kept in Solution, in an acrial State, by union with the mat|ter of heat, Ph. Tr.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT is evident, from this article, that the fixed Air only di&s;&s;olves and keeps Iron &s;u&s;pended in the Water. Its di&s;appearance &s;o &s;oon, &s;hews its very volatile Nature, and, the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;orting to the&s;e Springs, to have the benefit of a principle and ingredient, which gives penetrability, and action to the Saline contents of the Waters.</P>
<P N="5">5, 6. SHEW the Salts contained in the&s;e Waters are neutral: And, that neither the acid nor the Alkali, of which they are compounded, prevail.</P>
<P N="7">7-11. DEMONSTRATE, that Vitriolated magne&s;ia, is the principal Salt contained in the Walton Water. The attraction of an alkaline Salt, and e&s;pecially that of the cau&s;tic Alkali, with the Vitriolic Acid, is greater than that of the Magne&s;ia, which is precipi|tated in the&s;e experiments.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P N="8">8. THE exi&s;tence of Sea Salt, is manife&s;ted by this experiment, and by the cubic Cry&s;tals formed in the re&s;iduum.</P>
<P N="9">9, 10. FROM all our experiments, fixed Air di&s;&s;ol|ving a &s;mall quantity of Iron: Hepatic Air, united with an ab&s;orbent earth, appear to be the fugitive ingredients of the Walton Water. The fixed ingre|dients di&s;covered by evaporation and cry&s;talli&s;ation, appear to be a Vitriolated Magne&s;ia, united with a little Vitriolated Mineral Alkali, in the quantity of &s;ix or &s;even drachms, in one Gallon of Water. Magne&s;ia, Lime and ab&s;orbent earth, and a delique|&s;cent bitter Lixivium, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;alited Magne&s;ia and Lime, with a few grains of entire Sea Salt, alto|gether, about a drachm or two to a Gallon.</P>
<P>THAT the&s;e al&s;o are the component Medicinal in|gredients in the Cheltenham Water, appears by the analy&s;is, of the learned Dr. Fothergill, of Bath.</P>
<P>THIS Gentleman, in his very valuable experimen|tal enquiry into the nature and qualities of Chelten|ham Water, p. 42. concludes, "from the preceed|ing experiments, a Gallon of the Water, wine mea|&s;ure, appears to contain the &s;ub&s;equent principles, nearly in the following proportions: Native Glauber Salt, with a portion of Ep&s;om Salt, one ounce; Sea Salt, five grains; Iron combined with fixed Air, five grains; Magne&s;ia combined with fixed Air, twenty five grains; Calcareous earth, or Selenite, forty grains; fixed Air, combined with phlogi&s;tica|ted
<PB N="17" REF="16">Air, twenty-four ounce mea&s;ures. To the&s;e may, perhaps, be added a &s;mall proportion of Hepatic Gas or Hepar Sulphuris converted into Vapour by the &s;eparation of its phlogi&s;ton."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This u&s;eful Work has been much improved and enlarged in the Second Edition.</NOTE></P>
<P>BY this ingenious Work, it appears, and is &s;uffi|ciently known to all who frequent Cheltenham, that the Iron is very &s;oon precipitated from the Wa|ter, after it is drawn from the Pump; and, in a &s;hort time it cannot be made to a&s;&s;ume a purple colour, by the addition of a&s;tringents.</P>
<P>THE Salts of the Walton and Cheltenham Waters, are both &s;oluble in a very &s;mall quantity of Water, equal to their weight nearly: And their impre&s;&s;ion on the human &s;en&s;es, and, their action in the bowels, is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN &s;o many points, the Cheltenham and Walton Mineral Waters, are entirely like each other; a pint or le&s;s of each opens the body; &s;ome find a &s;mall addition of the Walton, nece&s;&s;ary to produce the &s;ame effect in the &s;ame degree; others find no dif|ference; the purgative Salt is &s;omewhat le&s;s, about a drachm in a gallon, in my experiments; but the quantity of fixed Air, and Steel are at lea&s;t equal. The Hepatic Air &s;eems to prevail in the Walton Water, over the Cheltenham, which gives it a mo&s;t plea&s;ing almo&s;t Oleaginous &s;oftne&s;s, and makes it highly grateful in ta&s;te, and gentle in operation, and,
<PB N="18" REF="17">far more &s;uitable in di&s;ea&s;es of the kidneys, and uri|nary pa&s;&s;ages, than the Cheltenham Water it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WITHOUT, therefore entering into a farther de|tail of Chymical re&s;earch, I apprehend the &s;imilarity of the Walton, to the Cheltenham Water, to be &s;uf|ficiently a&s;certained, to warrant its u&s;e and applica|tion in the di&s;ea&s;es, for which Cheltenham Waters have been u&s;ed with advantage.</P>
<P>THE analy&s;is of Mineral Waters, undoubtedly is highly u&s;eful; but notwith&s;tanding the perfection to which it is carried by di&s;coveries in modern Chymi&s;|try, I apprehend it gives a very imperfect idea of the real compo&s;ition of Waters; in &s;hort, &s;uch an idea as diffection gives of an animated body, a view of its parts disjointed, and &s;eparate, very different from that union, on which &s;ymmetry and life depend.</P>
<P>IT is on this account, that the exhibition of the in|gredients found to compo&s;e mineral Waters, and the imitations of many of them, admini&s;tred as Medi|cines, fall &s;hort of the Waters prepared by Nature, e&s;pecially when drank at the &s;ources.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame in other parts of the Materia Me|dica: An analy&s;is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a&s;&s;i&s;ts in ac|counting for the operation of a Medicine, but &s;eldom enables us to prepare, and compound to perfection, the natural productions we pretend to imitate.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Sentiments have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Ap|probation of M.

<P>THE u&s;e, and advantage of Waters, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by experience alone, as well as that of every article in the Materia Medica. The advantages found from the u&s;e of the Walton Well, in various eruptive di|&s;ea&s;es, and in old &s;ordid ulcers, as well as in many other di&s;ea&s;es, has already been &s;o con&s;iderable as to confirm the expectation grounded on their being &s;imilar to the Cheltenham Water.</P>
<P>IT will undoubtedly be found as much like Chel|tenham Water, as that Water is like it&s;elf at differ|ent &s;ea&s;ons. Sea&s;ons occa&s;ion accidental differences of &s;aturation in all Mineral Waters, the cau&s;e of which, is &s;ometimes known, and &s;ometimes un|known. Rainy &s;ea&s;ons, while they make Springs more abundant, render the Mineral impregnation at the &s;ame time weaker. To this alteration, the Wal|ton Water mu&s;t be &s;ometimes liable, as it lies on a plain, part of which is frequently overflowed with Water. But, if by experience, this &s;hall be &s;ound to have any con&s;iderable influence, means will be u&s;ed to remove the inconvenience. An inconveni|ence which is very &s;eldom likely to happen in dry and warm &s;ea&s;ons, in which, Waters of this cla&s;s, are for the mo&s;t part re&s;orted to.</P>
<P>AFTER all, I am per&s;uaded, that the dilution of Mineral Waters is very &s;eldom any injury to the pa|tient. The virtues and powers of Mineral Water, depending principally on the quantity of Water, the medium, in which the Medicinal ingredients are
<PB N="20" REF="19">&s;u&s;pended; the vehicle which conveys them into the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and makes them capable of re|moving ob&s;tructions fixed in them, and in various glands; hence the &s;ame Medicinal ingredients, given in the u&s;ual forms, have but little efficacy in remo|ving &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE healing powers of the Walton Well, and tho&s;e of its Si&s;ter of Cheltenham, are owing to the mixture of a neutral compound of vitriolated Mag|ne&s;ia, commonly called Ep&s;om. or Cathartic Salt; to vitriolated Mineral Alkali, or Glauber Salt, with a &s;mall portion of &s;alited Mineral Alkali, Magne&s;ia, and Lime, nearly to the quantity of a drachm, in a pint of Water; al&s;o to a con&s;iderable quantity of fixed Air, and Hepatic Gas, by the former of which Iron, and by the latter Magne&s;ia, and ab&s;orbent Earth, are held in Solution.</P>
<P>THE whole is a compo&s;ition, friendly to appetite and dige&s;tion; as well as &s;oft, and plea&s;ing to the ta&s;te. It is al&s;o a penetrating deob&s;truent, and, atte|nuating medicine, and in &s;en&s;ible operation, a quick and gentle Laxative and Diuretic; and when applied with di&s;cretion, it may be continued a long time without any dimunition of &s;trength.</P>
<P>IT is obvious, this Water contains Saline ingre|dients, and, others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing different attractive powers and a&s;&s;inities, which, though ballanced in the Water; yet, when mixed with animal fluids, and Salts in the cour&s;e of dige&s;tion, Chyli&s;ication,
<PB N="21" REF="20">and in circulation with the blood, mu&s;t be &s;o chang|ed, and varied as to form new attractions, and com|binations in their cour&s;e through the ve&s;&s;els, whence compounds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing properties, different from what exi&s;ted before, will be produced, and the &s;y&s;tem it|&s;elf will be changed. It is well known, that cold is generated by di&s;&s;olving Salts; and, that while Saline Bodies, of different affinities, and attractive powers, are forming new compounds; &s;uch Salts in the pro|ce&s;s of mutual attraction, and incorporation, produce heat. In this manner, and from &s;uch cau&s;es, new &s;timuli, with other alterations, take place in the glands, and remoter ve&s;&s;els of our &s;y&s;tem, from the Salts, combined with other ingredients in Mineral Waters; and, it is by the&s;e means, as well as eva|cuation, they become beneficial, and are really valu|able alterative Medicines.</P>
<P>THE Walton Waters, being a compound, <HI>&s;ui ge|veris,</HI> &s;imilar to Cheltenham, they both operate pri|marily, and principally on the inte&s;tines, as a gentle purgative, <Q>"Their mode of operation, (&s;ays Dr. Smith, p. 21, 22,) upon the inte&s;tines, producing an ea&s;y, &s;udden di&s;charge, is explainable upon the principle of the tenuity, and uniform diffu&s;ion of the ingredients in the Water. For the Water, after having performed its &s;trengthening, and ex|hilarating office upon the &s;tomach, pa&s;&s;es quickly into the inte&s;tines as &s;luids do, carrying along with it, more or le&s;s of all its ingredients, but particu|larly its great dilution, and con&s;equent di&s;per&s;ion

<P>COROLLARY. Mineral Waters in general, derive their healing powers much le&s;s from the metals, earths and &s;alts, often incon&s;iderable in quantity, which remain after evaporation, than, from the vo|latile principles, united with them, but diluted in a very great proportion of Water; and, they univer|&s;ally owe the activity the whole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, to the incorporation of the volatile and &s;ugitive principles, both with the Water, and, with the gro&s;&s;er ingre|dients, combined together mo&s;t intimately.</P>

<P>THE ta&s;te of the Walton Water, fre&s;h from the Spring, as has been already ob&s;erved, is at fir&s;t &s;oft, and afterwards agreeably Saline; the Sulphur and Iron, are al&s;o plainly ta&s;ted in it, in the quantity of a pint, and, often le&s;s, it occa&s;ions two or three lax &s;tools, and, operates without the lea&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, gri|ping or any kind of inconvenience.</P>
<P>THE quantity of urine is al&s;o encrea&s;ed: it &s;its ea&s;y on the &s;tomach, and appetite is promoted.</P>
<P>THE volatile principles fly off, &s;oon after the Wa|ter is removed from the Well; and, as the&s;e are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to its efficacy, and, render it agreeable to the ta&s;te and &s;tomach, and carry the Saline, invigora|ting, and deob&s;truent contents of the Water into the ve&s;&s;els and glands; it is nece&s;&s;ary to drink it from the Pump, or very &s;oon afterwards.</P>
<P>THESE Waters not only remove co&s;tivene&s;s, but encrea&s;e appetite, and the powers of dige&s;tion, The chylification of dige&s;ted aliment is more per|fectly elaborated, and, the errors of the fir&s;t dige&s;ti|on prevented, and remedied in an effectual manner; whatever is injurious to health in the &s;tomach and and inte&s;tines, acidity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilious putrid matter are carried out of the body. Worms, and their nidus
<PB N="24" REF="23">are expelled. In this manner the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e will be prevented in the chyliferous ve&s;&s;els; and the Chyle it&s;elf being highly elaborated, and, withal, diluted with the Water, enters the lacteals, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing &s;uch qualities and powers, as bid fair to obvi|ate, and remove ob&s;tructions which have taken place in the channels of the chyle and lymph.</P>
<P>HENCE, ob&s;tructions in the me&s;entery and glands will gradually be re&s;olved, as this Water will be like|ly to dilute and di&s;&s;olve any tenacious matter, inca|pable of moving in the chyliferous ve&s;&s;els, on account of its glutinous, chee&s;e-like, and, &s;teatomatous con|&s;i&s;tence, and, will &s;timulate the ve&s;&s;els, and, me|&s;enteric glands, by its Saline contents, &s;o as to en|able them to pu&s;h on any ob&s;tructing matter.</P>
<P>SOME portion of the Waters, being ab&s;orbed, will act as a powerful deob&s;truent in ob&s;tructions of the liver.</P>
<P>BY thinning the Hepatic bile, and, carrying that fluid regularly into the inte&s;tines. By preventing the &s;tagnation of bile in the gall-bladder. By gently &s;timulating the biliary ve&s;&s;els, and encrea&s;ing their action. In a word, by the united in&s;luence of the&s;e powers, recent ob&s;tructions, or older &s;cirrho&s;ities, which have taken place either at home, or by re&s;i|dence in warm climates, will be remodied.</P>
<P>CALCULOUS concretions in the biliary ducts, and, in the gall-bladder, when of a &s;ize capable of being
<PB N="25" REF="24">carried into the inte&s;tines, will be di&s;po&s;ed to be mo|ved thither, by that &s;timulus, which acting originally on the duodenum, will extend its influence along the Ductus Choledochus. In like manner, new concretions of the biliary kind, will be effectually prevented.</P>
<P>So that this Water will be found a very effectual remedy for jaundice ari&s;ing from gall-&s;tones, as well as from other cau&s;es, ob&s;tructing the di&s;charge of the bile into the inte&s;tines. It will al&s;o be found u&s;eful in removing ob&s;tructions in the &s;ub&s;tance of the Li|ver; and, in preventing hemmorrhoidal, and other di&s;charges of blood, which mo&s;t frequently originate from ob&s;tructions in the Liver.</P>
<P>HEMMORRHOIDAL &s;wellings, and di&s;charges of blood from other cau&s;es, ob&s;tructing, or retarding its motion, and, return through the branches of the vena portarum, will be ea&s;ed or relieved by a &s;ea&s;o|nable u&s;e of this Water.</P>
<P>THE &s;oftne&s;s, which is peculiar to this Water, renders it proper in di&s;ea&s;es of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; as it acts powerfully on the Kidneys, and occa&s;ions an encrea&s;ed &s;ecretion there, as well as in the inte&s;ti|nal tube; gravelly concretions will be prevented or wa&s;hed away. As the &s;ecretion of urine is in expe|rience, &s;ound e&s;&s;ential, for carrying out of the body, the Salts and Oils, which are prejudicial to health; purity of blood will be very greatly promoted by the encrea&s;e of this &s;ecretion; &s;o that by the free di&s;|charge
<PB N="26" REF="25">from this emunctory, along with that from the alimentary canal, the &s;kin will be clean&s;ed from hot red eruptions, and, from &s;caly, and &s;cabby in|cru&s;tations, which notoriou&s;ly ari&s;e from a blood, and habit overloaded with acrid, and impure matter; when by exce&s;s in diet, or by improper food, by im|perfect dige&s;tion, or inadequate &s;ecretion and excre|tion, &s;uch acrid corrupt matter is formed, and retained in our bodies. Gentle evacuation, by the u&s;e of &s;uch Waters, is generally a certain relief under the&s;e circum&s;tances; this has been experienced by various per&s;ons, but very remarkably by one TANNER from <HI>Kiddermin&s;ter,</HI> who has had a leprous eruption removed from his face, and other parts, by drinking the Walton Water, and, applying it ex|ternally; which relief, for &s;ix years pa&s;t, he had not obtained by any means whatever.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;erving the bile in a fluid &s;tate, and, the regular conveyance of it into the duodenum, will powerfully operate in compleating the dige&s;tion, and Chylification of the food; and, will give the blood tho&s;e properties, which &s;upport the health, and, vigour of the body.&mdash;With that, all cutaneous &s;oul|ne&s;s will di&s;appear, and, the bloom of beauty re-a&s;|&s;ume its charms, along with the ea&s;e, and cheerful|ne&s;s in&s;eparable from whole&s;ome &s;luids, and, from good health.</P>
<P>BY removing the &s;omes, which cau&s;es Scurvies, Scrophulous, Herpetic eruptions, Lepro&s;ies, and,
<PB N="27" REF="26">every kind of cutaneous &s;oulne&s;s, whether of the red, and pimply, or the &s;caly, and, ulcerous kinds; I &s;ay, by gradually draining off this fomes, and, &s;oliciting its exit from the emunctories, &s;uch foul|ne&s;&s;es of the &s;kin, accompanied with itchings, &s;ores, and, even &s;cirrhous, and, cancerous taints, will often be prevented, removed or palliated.</P>
<P>CHRONIC weakne&s;s, and, dejection of &s;pirits, ari&s;ing frequently from the &s;ame latent &s;ources, will receive relief from the &s;alutary, though &s;low opera|tion of the&s;e Waters.</P>
<P>OBSTRUCTIONS in the uterine &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppre&s;|&s;ions of the men&s;trual di&s;charge, and, other irregu|larities, and, exce&s;&s;es peculiar to it; the fluor albus, &s;cirrhous tumours, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the womb, will in many circum&s;tances and con&s;titutions, find a u&s;eful remedy in the Walton Water.</P>
<P>OBSTRUCTIONS left by the long continuance, and, the frequent return of intermittent fevers, will, probably, yield to a prudent u&s;e of the&s;e Waters; and, they will prepare the patient, and, put him in a fit &s;tate to receive further benefit from the Bark.</P>
<P>OBSTRUCTIONS in the Lungs, from a &s;corbutic cau&s;e, and, acrid humours in the blood, and inve|terate ophthalmia's, have been relieved, and, are likely to be &s;ucce&s;sfully treated by the Walton Water.</P>
<P>I SHALL not give many directions concerning the
<PB N="28" REF="27">u&s;e of this Water, profe&s;&s;edly &s;imilar to that of Cheltenham, the method of drinking, of which, has been long a&s;certained by e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age, and, the public is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the directions of eminent, and, able practitioners explanatory of their expe|rience, in this point.</P>
<P>THE Summer Months are the &s;ea&s;on to drink the Walton Waters; as they will, in the&s;e months, and, in dry weather be in their mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of im|pregnation.</P>
<P>LIKE Cheltenham, the Walton Waters are their own preparative; three quarters of a pint, drank at the Pump, may be taken in the morning, and after|noon, this quantity may be encrea&s;ed to three half-pints afterwards, if the former quantity does not &s;ufficiently open the body.</P>
<P>BUT I would ob&s;erve, that the middle do&s;es, &s;uch as merely pre&s;erve the body in a lax &s;tate, not ex|ceeding three &s;tools daily, are preferable to larger do&s;es, and to greater evacuation; the bu&s;ine&s;s and intention, being to carry off the ill-dige&s;ted remains of meals, perhaps of exce&s;s, and of luxury, and, of all kinds of corrupt recrementitious matter lodged in the alimentary canal, without impairing &s;trength and dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>EARLY hours are nece&s;&s;ary to an advantageous u&s;e of the Waters at the Well, where only they are drank without the lo&s;s of the active Volatile ingredi|ents,
<PB N="29" REF="28">which give power to tho&s;e that are more fixed, to penetrate into the glands, and &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>EXERCISE &s;ub dio, is al&s;o equally proper to &s;e|cond the operation of the Water, and to &s;trengthen the body.</P>
<P>AN ea&s;y dige&s;ted nutrient diet, con&s;i&s;ting, when it agrees with the &s;tomach, of milk in the morning and at night, of light meats and vegetables at dinner, with general temperance, and moderation in the u&s;e of vinous liquors, rather than total ab&s;tinence from them, is highly expedient.</P>
<P>IN a &s;ituation, where excellent fi&s;h is &s;o plentiful, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that moderation in this article will be prudent, as a very frequent u&s;e of fi&s;h is found often prejudicial in di&s;ca&s;es of the &s;kin, and, &s;ometimes produces the more ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es of that cla&s;s; di&s;ea&s;es, for which the&s;e Waters are pe|culiarly proper.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to add, that, however u&s;eful it may be to entertain the mind with plea&s;ing &s;ociety, and, an agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of amu&s;ements, it is always nece&s;&s;ary to retire to re&s;t at an early hour, and, before eleven o'clock at farthe&s;t to be in bed, that the con&s;titution may have the advantage of nature's &s;weet re&s;torer, balmy &s;leep.</P>
<P>IN the cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, and, many of the af|fections of the glands, for which the internal u&s;e of the&s;e Waters is proper; Baths of different degrees of
<PB N="30" REF="29">heat from that of common cold Water, to that of one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit's &s;cale, will be highly expedient; this will appear in a &s;tronger light, from what I &s;hall offer concerning the &s;unctions, and di&s;|ea&s;es of the lymphatic glands. I apprehend, the di&s;ea&s;es of the&s;e glands, are chiefly to be reached by the means of remedies, which are applied, &s;o as to be ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, which pa&s;s to the glands. I am confident, that the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate cutaneous, and glandular di&s;ea&s;es would yield to a due per&s;everance in the external and internal u&s;e of Waters and other proper remedies. But what the&s;e remedies are, and, al&s;o the u&s;e, whether external or internal of Mineral Waters, and of Medicines of all kinds, which are to produce any important and &s;alu|tary con&s;equence, can only be determined in parti|cular ca&s;es, and con&s;titutions, by the judgment of an able, and experienced phy&s;ician.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE <HI>FUNCTIONS</HI> AND <HI>DISEASES</HI> OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS.</HEAD>
<PB N="1" REF="31">
<P>THE u&s;e of Mineral Waters in di&s;ea&s;es of the glands, leads me to offer &s;ome thoughts, which, I believe, are either new, or have not been enough attended to, concerning the u&s;e, and di&s;ea&s;es of the lymphatic glands.</P>
<P>THE lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, which makes an impor|tant article in the anatomical di&s;coveries of the la&s;t century, has received much improvement in this. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to a&s;&s;ign to each improver or di&s;coverer, his due proportion of merit. I acknow|ledge my obligations to them all. To Haller, Meckel, Monro, Mr. Hew&s;on, Dr. William Hunter, and Mr. John Hunter, Mr. Sheldon, and Mr. Cruik|&s;hank; who have all contributed, and, &s;ome of them very &s;plendidly, to perfect the knowledge of this important part of the animal &s;y&s;tem; and, let them not deem it ami&s;s, that profiting by their labours, I endeavour to make them &s;ub&s;ervient to the know|ledge of the animal oeconomy, and to the healing art.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="32">
<P>THAT the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els ari&s;e from every vi&s;|cus, and, from every cavity in the body, as well as from the &s;kin, and the cellular membrane inve&s;ting the body, in prodigious, and till lately, in undi&s;co|vered numbers, is an anatomical truth of the greate&s;t importance, now clearly demon&s;trated, and univer|&s;ally acknowledged.</P>
<P>THE lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and lacteals are of the &s;ame kind, and, con&s;titute a &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, no where connected with the veins, containing red blood; but, which univer&s;ally terminate in the lacteal &s;ac and duct, and convey chyle, and lymph collected in every part into the &s;ubclaviam vein, where it mixes with the blood, and no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>THE, &s;ole and exclu&s;ive function of this &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els is ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>SOME, indeed, have held, that the red veins are &s;upplementary ab&s;orbents, e&s;pecially on &s;ome occa|&s;ions; and the illu&s;trious Walther and others, with &s;ome probability, have a&s;&s;igned this office to the ve|na portarum, e&s;pecially in di&s;ea&s;es, in which the conglobate glands of the me&s;entery are &s;cirrhous, or obliterated by age, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, or, the lacteal &s;ac, and duct it&s;elf is ob&s;tructed. The proofs of this are equivocal, and accounted for on different principles, by the &s;chool of Hunter, particularly, by that accurate anatomi&s;t, Mr. John Hunter, who fir&s;t di&s;covered that ab&s;orption is carried on by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els alone.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="33">
<P>THE lacteal, and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els univer&s;ally pa&s;s through conglobate glands, before the fluid they convey, reaches the lacteal duct; tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the inte&s;tines, enter the different orders of me&s;en|teric glands, and, the chyle and lymph depo&s;ited in the&s;e glands, is again ab&s;orbed from them by the va&s;a lymphatica efferentia, in order to be conveyed to the thoracic duct.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Cruik&s;hank pa&s;&s;im. p. 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS law is univer&s;al, and, the lymphatic veins wherever they ari&s;e, in no in&s;tance enter into the lacteal duct, without previou&s;ly, and repeatedly throwing the lymph into the conglobate glands, which are an e&s;&s;ential part of this &s;y&s;tem, a part of the greate&s;t importance, for the advantage of which, the lymph is ab&s;orbed, in order to be conveyed to them; and from them the lymph is taken up in a more purified, and a&s;&s;imilated &s;tate, and is conveyed by the lymphatica efferentia into the lacteal &s;ac and duct.</P>
<P>THE &s;tructure of the&s;e glands is both va&s;cular and cellular; into the&s;e cells the lymph is thrown, and the ab&s;orbing lymphatics, the lymphatica efferentia, are the only excretories, to all the conglobate glands; the u&s;es of which are acknowledged to be unknown and undi&s;covered, by gentlemen to whom anatomi&s;ts are &s;o much indebted, Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>YET it is a matter not only intere&s;ting in the &s;ci|ence of phy&s;iology, to a&s;certain their u&s;e, but is like|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to enable us to under&s;tand more per|fectly the di&s;ea&s;es of the glands, and, to treat them with &s;ucce&s;s: we will therefore pur&s;ue the enquiry.</P>
<P>A FLUID is con&s;tantly exhaled into the cavities containing the vi&s;cera; this fluid is liable to be altered, either by remora or mixture; the ab&s;orption of this fluid is the function of the internal lymphatics, and, when it is prevented, either by ob&s;truction of the conglobate glands, or, by any other cau&s;e; Drop&s;ies in the brain, thorax, pericardium, abdomen, and the widely diffu&s;ed cellular membrane, ari&s;e.</P>
<P>THE lymph along with the chyle, and nutritious liquors prepared from the food in the inte&s;tinal
<PB N="5" REF="35">canal, is ab&s;orbed by the lacteal and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, for they are the &s;ame; the&s;e fluids are immediately thrown into the me&s;enteric glands; and, they are more numerous there than in other parts, becau&s;e their office is peculiarly important, that of perfecting the chyle or nutritious fluid, extracted by dige&s;tion from food. That fluid is perfected by intercepting what is noxious in the cells of the conglobate glands, where it undergoes a dige&s;tion before it is ab&s;orbed by the &s;econd and third orders of the lacteal ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, ari&s;e al&s;o from the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and from the glandular vi&s;cera; from the pelvis, the bladder, and parts of genera|tion, both in males and females; they ob&s;erve the &s;ame law, and pa&s;s through the iliac conglobate glands, or others before they enter the lacteal &s;ac; and, their u&s;e is the &s;ame, to intercept crude, nox|ious, una&s;&s;imilated matter, which has been ren|dered unfit by di&s;ea&s;e, or other means to mix imme|diately, and unaltered, with the blood.</P>
<P>THE food we take in, and the air we breathe, while they convey the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports of life, contain al&s;o the feeds of di&s;ea&s;e and death.</P>
<P>THE lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, which ari&s;e in the mouth, and, from the trachea and lungs, (where their num|ber is immen&s;e), convey the fluids they ab&s;orb, with whatever extraneous matter has been taken up to the numerous conglobate glands of the neck, to the thy|roid gland, thymus, and the glands of the lungs,
<PB N="6" REF="36">where it is dige&s;ted before it reaches the thoracic duct.</P>
<P>IN young animals who take in their food by &s;uc|tion, in which action much is ab&s;orbed by the lym|phatics; the glands are very large, numerous and con&s;picuous, the more perfectly to dige&s;t, and anima|li&s;e the crude fluids received by &s;uction, with the milk.</P>
<P>WHEN that period of life is pa&s;&s;ed over, the thy|roid glands and thymus are not quite &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and abate in &s;ize, but are never totally obliterated.</P>
<P>IN pointing out the bu&s;ine&s;s of purifying, and animali&s;ing lymph, as the function, of the conglo|bate glands in general, I believe I have di&s;covered the u&s;e of the thymus in infants, and, of the thy|roid glands, hitherto one of the hidden my&s;teries in anatomy.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Cruik&s;hank, &s;peaking of the Thymus, &s;ays, "I know not the u&s;e of this gland;" and of the Thyroid gland, "as I have not the lea&s;t conception of its u&s;e, I do not under&s;tand what functions in particular its ab&s;orbents perform," p. 183.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE external &s;urface of the body, is no le&s;s ab|&s;orptive, fluids are imbibed, thir&s;t abated, urine and weight encrea&s;ed from thence. Garlick, externally applied is &s;oon &s;melled in the breath. Turpentine gives the urine a violet &s;mell. Variolous matter, and the venereal poi&s;on introduced by the &s;malle&s;t puncture, produce &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es, and, previous to univer&s;al infection and diffu&s;ion, the inguinal and axillary glands, are &s;welled and inflamed by the pa&s;|&s;age of the poi&s;on into them. Mercury, the anti|dote
<PB N="7" REF="37">to this poi&s;on, al&s;o enters freely by the &s;kin. Bli&s;ters applied to the arms and &s;houlders inflame the axillary glands; tho&s;e of the neck in children, particularly are made hard and &s;ore by ulcers behind the ears, and in the head, and, by bli&s;ters to tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>ULCERS and punctures in the legs, and other parts, often occa&s;ion &s;wellings along the lymphatics up to, the axillae, or inguinal glands. Purulent bubos ari&s;e frequently from &s;uch ulcers, and, from matter formed in the joints. The axillary glands are &s;welled by &s;tagnating milk, by cancerous &s;wellings, and inflammations in the brea&s;t. Cancers in the lips and on the face, cau&s;e &s;imilar &s;wellings under the lower jaw, and, in the neck. The &s;ame glands are &s;welled by gum boils, and by venereal &s;ores in the lips. Acrid matter ab&s;orbed, inflames the lympha|tic ve&s;&s;el, and, the gland, univer&s;ally, between the &s;eat of the matter and &s;ore, and, the thoracic duct; and, its entrance into the body, may be prevented by cau&s;tic, or, by the exci&s;ion of the part. Pow|ders &s;cattered over the &s;urface of the body are ab&s;or|bed, thus calomel is known to enter; and, I remem|ber a degree of &s;alivation, and &s;ore mouth, produced by a &s;mall quantity of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate, rubbed with crude &s;al armoniac and camphire &s;cattered on bed linen, in order to prevent a morbus pediculo&s;us.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the&s;e various facts, that all lymphatic ve&s;&s;els perpetually enter the conglobate
<PB N="8" REF="38">glands, and, in the cells, of which the&s;e glands uni|ver&s;ally con&s;i&s;t, depo&s;ite the lymph, which being ab&s;orbed once, and, again by larger lymphatics, is at length conveyed by the great channel, the lacteal duct, into the vena cava de&s;cendens, under the left calavicle. When we recollect, that the Venereal Virus, Cancerous and Variolous poi&s;ons, enter the body by the&s;e channels, and, and are primarily de|po&s;ited in the&s;e glands, occa&s;ioning there tumours, &s;ometimes indolent, &s;ometimes painful, inflamed and &s;uppurating. It &s;eems clear, the&s;e glands are intend|ed by nature, to purify the lymph, before it enters the blood ve&s;&s;els, from matter, which may be noxious there, by arre&s;ting it in the glands, univer&s;ally con|nected with ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e glands, it is either altered by a concoc|ting, and dige&s;ting power inherent in them, or when it is too noxious to be &s;ubdued into a &s;alutary nature it remains in the form of a tumour, or e&s;capes by &s;uppuration. When it cannot be &s;ubdued, nor re|moved by &s;uppuration, and, tho&s;e &s;alutary efforts of nature fail, it is then ab&s;orbed, and, diffu&s;es di&s;ea&s;e in the con&s;titution at large.</P>
<P>THUS the glands in the neck, and the thyroid are interpo&s;ed to intercept crude matter, or noxious Vi|rus taken up from the no&s;trils, mouth, trachea and lungs, and other parts about the neck and brea&s;t, more e&s;pecially in very young animals.</P>
<P>THE me&s;enteric glands purify, and dige&s;t, what|ever
<PB N="9" REF="39">is ab&s;orbed with the lymph and chyle from the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>THE axillary, and inguinal glands, alter and in|tercept whatever extraneous matter may happen to be ab&s;orbed from the &s;urface of the body, or the cel|lular membrane.</P>
<P>THE glands have the power of a&s;&s;imilating into a &s;ound fluid, &s;uch noxious matter, in very many in&s;tances. But when it is highly virulent as in the lues, in &s;crophulous, and in cancerous di&s;ea&s;es, that dige&s;ting and a&s;&s;imilating function is overpowered, the gland remains &s;cirrhous, or, is de&s;troyed by &s;up|puration, and, the matter enters, and contaminates the habit.</P>
<P>IN fine, the u&s;e of the&s;e glands is to intercept as &s;ponges, and to alter as dige&s;tive organs, whatever is unfit to enter into the ma&s;s of blood. In ordinary ca&s;es, this is effected without ob&s;truction, or, inflam|mation, and, then no apparent con&s;equences detri|mental to health appear, and, the depo&s;ited matter is ab&s;orbed again, and, goes along with the &s;ound lymph. In extraordinary ca&s;es, the poi&s;on remains in the gland, and, de&s;troys its powers fir&s;t, and its &s;ub&s;tance, and organization afterwards.</P>
<P>THE fatal con&s;equences, which have followed in|jections of undige&s;ted alimentary fluids, directly into the red veins of living animals, are proofs that the lymphatic glands have the u&s;e and function here
<PB N="10" REF="40">alledged, and, &s;how, that without the <HI>lymphatic dige&s;|tion,</HI> liquors apparently harmle&s;s, are unfit to mix with the blood; and, produce fatal effects there.<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Haller, Elem. Phy&s;. Tom. 1. p. 228.</NOTE></P>
<P>HOW the glands alter, dige&s;t, and a&s;&s;imilate the matter ab&s;orbed, and depo&s;ited in them, I know not, and &s;hall not attempt to explain; I think that power implanted in them, as well as in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; and, we &s;ee an important apparatus, &s;et apart for the purpo&s;e, by Him! who&s;e ability is too great, in every in&s;tance to be fully comprehended, and interpreted by us his creatures.</P>
<P>FROM the u&s;es here a&s;cribed to the lymphatic glands we &s;ee, why they are mo&s;t numerous, where ab&s;orption is greate&s;t; and, particularly in tho&s;e parts, where crude matter is ab&s;orbed. We &s;ee, why the glands are nearly as numerous in the neck as in the me&s;entery<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">P. 130.</NOTE>; for be&s;ide the matter ab&s;or|bed from the in&s;ide of the mouth, no&s;trils, and trachea; the ab&s;orbents from the brain join the glands of the neck. Though the&s;e have not been traced by anatomi&s;ts; as a copious exhalation, and, ab&s;orption con&s;tantly take place in the ventricles of that organ; as we have rea&s;on to believe, the Water in the internal hydrocephalus is &s;ometimes ab&s;orbed; from the general law, we may pre&s;ume, that lym|phatics exi&s;t in the brain, though not certainly traced there<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">P. 127, Cruik&s;hank.</NOTE>; this is confirmed by the internal
<PB N="11" REF="41">cephalus often happening in &s;crophulous and ricketty children, in whom the glands of the neck are &s;cirr|hous.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that &s;wellings of the glands of|ten follow cruptive di&s;ea&s;es. They ari&s;e after &s;car|let fever, mea&s;les and &s;mall pox. Drop&s;y, is &s;ome|times the con&s;equence of them all. And I have known the hydrocephalus internus, as well as other Drop&s;ies &s;ucceed the &s;carlet fever; another pre&s;ump|tive proof, that ab&s;orption in the brain, is carried on by lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, as well as in other parts.</P>
<P>WE al&s;o, &s;ee why the glands are more numerous in the me&s;entery, through which all the chyle pa&s;&s;es and are &s;maller, and le&s;s numerous in the me&s;ocolon, through which hardly any chyle pa&s;&s;es, whence Mr. Cruik&s;hank is led to &s;ay, "this looks as if the glands were intended to produce &s;ome remarkable change in the chyle"<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">P. 127.&mdash;of Cruik&s;hank.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE me&s;enteric glands, as well as the conglobate glands in other parts, being cellular, as well as va&s;|cular, contain a white milky fluid, mo&s;t con&s;picuous and abundant in young animals. Album perpetuo re|peri, &s;ays, Haller, Elem. Phy&s;. T. 1.</P>
<P>THESE glands, though greatly le&s;s in adults than in young animals, are yet not totally obliterated. The illu&s;trious Haller, has &s;een the thymus in the me|dia&s;tinum, and the glands in the me&s;entery, and in
<PB N="12" REF="42">the inte&s;tinum rectum in adults; in children, they are very large and &s;ucculent, Elem. Phy&s;. T. 1. p. 192.</P>
<P>THE lymphatic ve&s;&s;els being de&s;titute of the mo|ving impul&s;e of the heart, and having no other prin|ciple of motion to carry on the liquors ab&s;orbed, but that of the irritability of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, the motion of the lymph is nece&s;&s;arily liable to be ob|&s;tructed. Hence ob&s;tructions happen more fre|quently in the conglobate and lymphatic glands, than in the conglomerate glands. The liver may be excepted, becau&s;e the blood conveyed into it by the vena portarum, undergoes a &s;imilar retardation in that very &s;ingular vein.</P>
<P>THE conglobate glands, are hence univer&s;ally lia|ble to &s;cirrho&s;ity and ob&s;truction. The me&s;enteric glands are notoriou&s;ly liable to great enlargement and hardne&s;s, and thereby often cau&s;e a &s;low con&s;uming &s;ever and atrophy in infants. Similar &s;wellings in the me&s;enteric glands are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved from ulcerated inte&s;tines after dy&s;entery. The neck is &s;el|dom &s;trumous without accompanying ob&s;tructions in the me&s;enteric glands.</P>
<P>THE thyroid axillary and mammary glands, as well as the iliac lumbar and inguinal glands are all frequently &s;ound ob&s;tructed and &s;cirrhous. In a word the&s;e glands are not only ob&s;tructed in venereal and cancerous habits; but the &s;crophula and rachitis likewi&s;e originate in them, and are principally &s;eated in the glands.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="43">
<P>IN all ca&s;es of ob&s;tructed glands, the chyle and lymph, being imperfectly a&s;&s;imilated, the blood be|comes gradually vitiated, and, unfit for nouri&s;hment. Hence that acrimony often called &s;corbutic; an ul|cerous and even cancerous di&s;po&s;ition of fluids origi|nate. From the &s;ame &s;ource the bones become brit|tle, break in &s;ome, and are rendered &s;oft and flexible in others.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e facts con&s;pire to &s;hew the importance of the dige&s;tive, and a&s;&s;imilating power of the glands, and, lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, in perfecting the animal fluids.</P>
<P>IN di&s;ea&s;ed glands, the chyle is not &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;imilated, and, that defect gradually induces acri|mony, and impurity in the lymph, which &s;oon taints the blood and habit univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>IT is more from this defect, than from the en|trance of the chyle into the blood, being prevented by ob&s;truction, that mara&s;mus, and con&s;umption follow &s;cirrho&s;ities in the me&s;entric glands.</P>
<P><Q>"IT is po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;ays, the ingenious Cruik&s;hank, <Q>"that children, and, even grown per&s;ons, may have died of the tabes me&s;enterica from ob&s;tructions in the glands, rendering them impervious to the chyle."</Q> But he never &s;aw any &s;uch &s;tagnation of chyle, as the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to cau&s;e, on any occa|&s;ion whatever.<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">P. 107, Cruik&s;hank.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="14" REF="44">
<P>THE lymph, and chyle, enter the blood but in a corrupted, crude, unanimali&s;ed &s;tate.</P>
<P>I AM confirmed in this opinion, by the experi|ments of another excellent Anatomi&s;t, Mr. Sheldon, which I &s;hall quote from his &s;plendid Hi&s;tory of the Human Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>IN &s;ubjects, in which the lymphatic glands of the me&s;entery, were found entirely ob&s;tructed, &s;ometimes by a curd-like &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ometimes by calcareous earth, Mr. Sheldon, could pu&s;h injections of quick|&s;ilver from the ve&s;&s;els, below the ob&s;tructed glands, to tho&s;e above them, though not a &s;ingle particle of quick&s;ilver, could be made to enter the glands in this ob&s;tructed &s;tate. In this ca&s;e, the collateral branches of the lacteal ve&s;&s;els, which communicated with tho&s;e above, were enlarged, and, had conveyed the chyle into the lacteal duct.</P>
<P>THE ingenious Dr. Che&s;ton, found the cavity of the lacteal duct totally ob&s;tructed for a con&s;iderable length, by an earthy matter, in a man who had a Spina Vento&s;a of the os ilium.</P>
<P>IT is probable, the chyle, in this ca&s;e, was con|veyed from below, into the lacteal duct, above the ob&s;truction, by one or more collateral ana&s;tomo&s;ing branches, which are every where numerous in the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, and, frequent in the lacteal duct it&s;elf. This being a provi&s;ion of nature, for &s;ecuring more certainly, a regular conveyance of the chyle in|to the blood ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="45">
<P>I remember a melancholy ca&s;e, which &s;hews the thoracic duct, &s;ometimes is ob&s;tructed in a fatal degree; a young lady, high in rank, beautiful in per&s;on, and amiable in di&s;po&s;ition; had a &s;welling in the neck, which extended it&s;elf under the left cla|vicle, and there ob&s;tructed the entrance of the tho|racic duct into the &s;ubclavian vein &s;o completely, as to render her incurably drop&s;ical in every part of her body.</P>
<P>WHAT I have now offered, concerning the u&s;e of the glands, belonging to the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, will, I apprehend, derive &s;upport from the late di&s;cove|ries, and will be found u&s;eful in the treatment of di&s;|ea&s;es of the glands.</P>
<P>MEDICINES taken into the &s;tomach, and mixed with the chyle, are, indeed, in the direct channel, to reach the di&s;ea&s;ed glands of the me&s;entery.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the ca&s;e, re&s;pecting the conglo|bate glands in other parts. Medicines mixing with the blood never directly reach the&s;e glands. and, but very remotely, and indirectly affect them; and, this is one of the rea&s;ons why, di&s;ea&s;es in the&s;e glands, have always appeared &s;o &s;tubborn, and have &s;o rare|ly yielded to the common treatment, and internal u&s;e of Medicine.</P>
<P>THE confiding alone to Medicines, conveyed by the lacteals into the channel of circulation; the in|attention to the only entrance into the external di&s;ea|&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="46">glands, that by ab&s;orption, are I am per&s;uaded, cau&s;es why tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have proved &s;o ob&s;tinate, and rebellious to Medical treatment.</P>
<P>IT is the cau&s;e why &s;crophula, and &s;cirhous glands, have become cancerous, and finally incu|rable and fatal.</P>
<P>IT is evident then, that the remedies proper for removing ob&s;tructions &s;hould be applied to &s;uch parts, from whence the lymphatics ari&s;e which may ab&s;orb and conduct them to the glands, the ob&s;truc|tions of which are to be removed.</P>
<P>APPLICATIONS intended to remove glandular &s;wel|lings in the neck, the thyroid gland, the bronchocele &amp;c. mu&s;t be made to the head, neck, cheeks, and mouth internally, as well as externally.</P>
<P>VAPOURS inhaled by in&s;piration, are proper in the di&s;ea&s;ed glands of the lungs.</P>
<P>REMEDIES intended to pa&s;s into the axillary glands, mu&s;t be applied to the arms and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>IN di&s;ea&s;es of the inguinal glands the remedies intended to pa&s;s into them, and through them, mu&s;t be applied to the genitals, and to the legs and thighs.</P>
<P>THE advantages found from the local application of Mercury in Venereal &s;wellings of the inguinal, and axillary glands, and in ulcers of the throat, ex|emplify this doctrine in that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="47">
<P>THE holding Medicines intended to remove the the bronchocele, and &s;welled neck, in the mouth and under the tongue, is e&s;&s;ential to give efficacy to the&s;e Medicines, as has been long experienced, in the Coventry Medicine. The &s;aline ingredients, whether alcaline, or neutral, of which &s;uch Medi|cines u&s;ually con&s;i&s;t, are ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els ari&s;ing in the in&s;ide of the mouth, and, are conveyed directly to the di&s;ea&s;ed glands with con|&s;tant good effect.</P>
<P>INTERNAL ob&s;tructions in the me&s;entery in parti|cular, are to be relieved by internal Medicines; and in every kind of glandular ob&s;truction Mineral Wa|ters have been found highly nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>THE Chalybeate, the &s;ulphureous, the &s;aline, the hot, and the cold Waters, have all been tried with advantage.</P>
<P>OF laxative Medicines, the purgative Mineral Waters, always operate with the lea&s;t diminution of &s;trength, and with the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; the ap|petite is for the mo&s;t part mended under their u&s;e, and important alterations in the whole &s;y&s;tem, ari&s;e from continuing to apply to them. Their operation principally affects the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in clearing away what is recrimentitious, and hurtful in that &s;eat and &s;ource of corruption.</P>
<P>THEY next directly operate on the lacteal ve&s;&s;els and glands; they dilute the chyle, and &s;timulate the
<PB N="18" REF="48">lacteals them&s;elves, which are &s;ufficiently irritable; and remove thereby, both the &s;ource of ob&s;truction, and the ob&s;tructions, which may have taken place, in the conglobate glands of the me&s;entery.</P>
<P>IN this manner they contribute to the purity, and perfection of the chyle and lymph, and remove all ob&s;tacles, to its perfect dige&s;tion in the inte&s;tinal ca|nal, and in the lacteal ve&s;&s;els and glands.</P>
<P>HENCE this &s;ource of tainted fluids being taken away from the chyle and blood, and no new acrimo|nious depo&s;ition falling on the remoter parts of the body; the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els and glands, there rea&s;|&s;ume their functions, and, ab&s;orb and dige&s;t, what was before lodged on the &s;kin, and on the adjacent parts of the &s;urface of the body.</P>

<P>THE Sea Water, acts not only as a powerful in|ternal remedy in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es; but has its effi|cacy greatly promoted by bathing; wa&s;hing thereby away much cutaneous foulne&s;s, and removing more by being directly ab&s;orbed into the lymphatic's, and conveyed to the di&s;ea&s;ed glands; at the &s;ame time, that a u&s;eful &s;pring and vigour is given to the whole con&s;titution.</P>
