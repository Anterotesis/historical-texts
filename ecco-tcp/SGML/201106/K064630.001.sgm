<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING has &s;urpri&s;ed me more than to find that novels and romances &s;till maintain their ground, in the libraries of the Fair. Mi&s;takes and prejudices are wearing daily away in other things, to the great improvement and en|lightening of mankind; but with regard to female education, &s;ome cu&s;toms have
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
been abrogated, which had better have re|mained, as they were on the &s;afe &s;ide, even &s;uppo&s;ing them to have been errors, while this, among others, &s;tands &s;till unrepealed, though the &s;lighte&s;t &s;en&s;e or reflection might have exploded it long ago; nay, &s;hould have &s;tifled the <HI>chimaera</HI> in its very birth.</P>
<P>What has been urged in favour of the&s;e kind of writings, is, that the extraordina|rine&s;s of the adventures, and the variety of the incidents, are fitted to induce young la|dies into an habit of reading, at fir&s;t, which may afterwards be directed to more profita|ble &s;tudies: that the per&s;onages in romances, are of the mo&s;t exalted ranks, and their characters of the mo&s;t perfect kinds; and that therefore the conduct and &s;entiments of &s;uch examples, might be proper to imbue young minds with refined precedents, and elevated notions. That novels &s;erve to afford them a general knowledge of life, without the hazard of their own experience; which may teach them a prudent diffidence in their own &s;trength, and a &s;afe caution again&s;t the arts and intrigue of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">Again&s;t this plau&s;ibility, I argue, That hi&s;tory &s;upplies us with as extraordinary events, and as entertaining incidents, as any which can po&s;&s;ibly be met with in fiction; that the characters in the latter, being but ideal, lo&s;e the full influence of example, and that the &s;entiments con&s;equently, become defi|cient in the authority of precept. That in the former, there are many real characters, as brave, as noble, and as perfect, as any to be met with in romance; and the &s;enti|ments, maxims, and reflections, of per&s;ons who did really exi&s;t, upon occa&s;ions which did actually occur, have infinitely more &s;pirit, beauty and moral, in them, than all the imaginary ones that ever have been framed by the &s;terile labour, and puerile genius of noveli&s;ts or romancers. And with regard to the knowledge &s;aid to be gained from the &s;tudy of novels, I cannot imagine what benefit young women may be likely to draw from repeated memoirs of eloping daughters, frail mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, or faithle&s;s wives.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">Nay, if polite readers would have &s;ome|thing &s;till more intere&s;ting than novels or romances, than even any hi&s;tory or biogra|phy already extant, modern writers may well &s;upply them&s;elves with cotemporary materials for &s;uch a work, from public an|nals, and private anecdotes. As far as Orondates is exceeded by Scanderbeg, does not <HI>Frederic</HI> excel him again, in every qua|lity which marks the king, the &s;oldier, the &s;cholar, and the philo&s;opher? The pre&s;ent age has pre&s;ented us with an heroe who gives the appearance of veracity to an|tient fable, and will convey the air of fiction to future hi&s;tory. Are not the tales of <HI>Boccace</HI> put out of countenance by the <HI>Lives of the Empre&s;&s;es?</HI> and the&s;e exceeded again by the modern memoirs&mdash;not yet publi&s;hed &mdash;of lady &mdash; and lady &mdash;? I forget their titles.</P>
<P>It was upon &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, that I have undertaken, on the credit of an hi&s;|toriographer, to publi&s;h the following me|moirs; every particular of which, except the names of per&s;ons and places, can be
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
authenticated by living te&s;timonies; in&s;o|much that as each &s;eparate fact may be in cour&s;e recorded, one man &s;hall &s;ay <HI>openly,</HI> I bear evidence to this; another, I can an|&s;wer for that; while &s;ome ladies &s;hall <HI>tacitly</HI> cry, I could vouch this, that, or t'other&mdash; if I dur&s;t. And &s;o of the re&s;t. And yet, to the great good fortune of tho&s;e who de|light in fiction, the whole will neverthele&s;s, bear the air of a novel; not from any man|ner of addre&s;s in the publi&s;her, but from the incidental circum&s;tances, and extraordinary contingencies of the real &s;tory.</P>
<P>But &s;hould it be &s;till objected, by any of your over-&s;crupulous lovers of truth, that many of the characters herein repre&s;ented, carry &s;omewhat the appearance of <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> let them but only reflect a little, upon real life, and they mu&s;t certainly recollect to have frequently met with genuine peculiarities, contradictions, foibles, and ab&s;urdities, among mankind, more <HI>outr&eacute;es,</HI> or extrava|gant, than any of the <HI>caracatura</HI>'s of the <HI>Dramatis Per&s;onae,</HI> even though the &s;tage,
<PB N="x" REF="9">
like a gallery, is allowed to exhibit figures larger than the life.</P>
<P>How I happened to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e memoirs, is not at all material to the Public; however, I have really &s;o much complacency for &s;o re&s;pectable a body, that I would &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity, even in this trifling article, if I could limit the di&s;covery to that particular only; but it is &s;urrounded and connected with &s;o many, and &s;uch va|rious well-known circum&s;tances, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to reveal it, without making, at the &s;ame time, too full a di&s;covery of my&s;elf; which might lay me extremely open to the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of the republic of letters, that a per&s;on of my deep erudition, exten&s;ive thought, and compre|hen&s;ive judgment, &s;hould throw away his genius and learning, &s;o idly and unprofita|bly, in dige&s;ting a parcel of in&s;ignificant events, and <HI>ob&s;olete</HI> morals, into a con&s;i&s;tent &s;eries or dige&s;t, while any <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> of the Cabala remains unexpounded; or that the <HI>points</HI> of Hebrew vowels, continue &s;till to be a point in que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">As to the inaccuracies which perhaps &s;ome minute critics may ob&s;erve upon in the following pages, I do not think them worth amending, in a work of this kind. I write always without book, and ju&s;t as if I was &s;peaking to you. Suppo&s;e now, for in&s;tance, that you and I were occa&s;ionally conver&s;ing together, upon &s;ome literary to|pic, or other; would it not be extremely pedantic in me to interrupt the di&s;cour&s;e till I went into my &s;tudy to &s;ettle the olym|piad of an hi&s;toric fact? Or would any body now, give a farthing difference, whe|ther it was Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, or A&s;inius Pollio, that reprehended the <HI>Patavinit&eacute;</HI> of Titus Livius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the fir&s;t note in chapter xxxv.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Writing and correcting, like &s;aying and doing, are very different things; and the latter I take to be by much the more tedious and laborious. Now I think that either of them is even full trouble enough for one per&s;on; therefore I really never do more my&s;elf, than write, and leave the world to
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
correct: they have more dull time on their hands, it relieves their idlene&s;s, and grati|fies their malice; for &s;ome readers would loo&s;e half their plea&s;ure, if they did not meet &s;omething to find fault with. It &s;ets them, in &s;ome &s;ort, above the writer, and I yield them their advantage freely.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e volumes have been wrote at inns, or in the mid&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s, or com|pany; and indeed the be&s;t way, in my opinion, as well as the ea&s;ie&s;t too, is never to form any plan for writing, at all; for it gives a con&s;traint and &s;tiffne&s;s to the work, which betrays <HI>the lamp</HI> too much. The great beauty of the antient authors, may be owing, perhaps, to their having wrote in|tirely without rules; while the <HI>modelling</HI> moderns endeavour to cramp even what little genius they have left. In the fir&s;t, you perceive the free &s;troke of the pencil; in the latter, is di&s;covered the re&s;traint of the compa&s;s. Or compare, if you plea&s;e, the confined mincings of a <HI>go-cart,</HI> with the un&s;pancelled &s;trides of manhood.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12">However this formal age may po&s;&s;ibly find fault with me for the mixed matters, the <HI>tragi-comic</HI> manner of writing, in the&s;e volumes. They urge that all works &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent, or of a piece; either &s;erious, or comical; learned, or unlearned; pious, or prophane. But Sir Richard Steele &s;ays, <Q>It is the misfortune of our time, that people think it as ea&s;y to be critics, as politicians.</Q> Here he &s;poke ironically, for they are both equally difficult. There are <HI>Arcana Literae,</HI> as well as <HI>Imperii,</HI> which, if a per&s;on is not let into the mi&s;tery of, he may frequently find fault in the wrong place, in both in&s;tances.</P>
<P>In a work like this, de&s;igned for the Public at large, there mu&s;t be &s;omething, in allu&s;ion to dramatic writings, to enter|tain the three different cla&s;&s;es of auditors; pit, box, and gallery. The &s;tage of Athens, from whence your learned, but ignorant critics, frame their drama, was cha&s;ter than ours, becau&s;e their audience was all of a piece. In&s;omuch, that Plato
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
being a&s;ked by Diony&s;ius, (now I am not certain whether it was Plato or Diony&s;ius) whom he would recommend as a preceptor for his &s;on, replied, Send to Athens, and take the fir&s;t man you meet with in the &s;treets. But modern readers and audiences are in an unhealthful &s;tate, and mu&s;t &s;ome|times be indulged in unwhole&s;ome &s;ea|&s;onings, to help them to dige&s;t proper food.</P>
<P>This then, may &s;eem to have been the de&s;ign of that anomalous, heteroclite genius, the author of Tri&s;tram Shandy, who&s;e prin|cipal end, I hope and believe, was to in|culcate that great <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of mankind, humanity and benevolence.</P>
<P>"A tale may catch him who a &s;ermon flies."</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, that he has given us, ac|cording to the vulgar phra&s;e, rather <HI>more &s;auce than pig,</HI> and this not &s;ufficiently &s;ea|&s;oned with <HI>Attic &s;alt,</HI> neither. But he &s;eems to have wrote more for the pre&s;ent age than the future ones; judging like
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
Aurelius, though in a far different &s;en&s;e, that <HI>&s;urviving fame is but oblivion.</HI> What is po&s;thumous fame? Meat blown up in a &s;hamble&mdash;A dead body puffed up with the breath of the living. Modern writers &s;eem perfectly indifferent how &s;oon their works die, provided they them&s;elves can live; and may be compared to butchers, who thrive the better, the more they <HI>&s;laughter.</HI></P>
<P>His third part is better, that is, not &s;o bad as his &s;econd. There is a good deal of laughable impertinence in it. He has repeated the &s;ame <HI>empty</HI> humour there, of an <HI>unlettered</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The marbled paper.</NOTE> page, and has given us a <HI>carte|blanche,</HI> in this la&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 147, vol. 6.</NOTE>. Whatever is neither quite &s;en&s;e, nor ab&s;olute non&s;en&s;e, is true Shandeic. However, through the whole, there is &s;ome entertainment for a &s;plenetic per&s;on, though none at all for a rational one.</P>
<Q>Qui Tri&s;tram non odit, amet rhap&s;odias Rablais.</Q>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="15">But there are &s;ome things in that work, which ought to be more &s;everely repre|hended; though it is folly, rather than vice, that tempts people to &s;peak in a gro&s;s manner; while others reli&s;h it, in general, more for want of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> than virtue. It requires genius to be witty, without being wicked at the &s;ame time; but the mo&s;t <HI>vulgar parts</HI> may &s;erve for ob&s;ce|nity. 'Tis ea&s;ier to make one <HI>laugh,</HI> than <HI>&s;mile;</HI> and when dullne&s;s would be witty, it lets fly bawdry, as it does &s;omething el&s;e, &s;atisfied to rai&s;e a laugh, though it does a &s;tink al&s;o. Loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, in a woman, are a double vice, as they offend again&s;t decency, as well as virtue; but in a clergy|man, they are treble; becau&s;e they hurt religion al&s;o.</P>
<P>But to his graver works&mdash;His &s;ermons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yoric's &s;ermons.</NOTE> are written profe&s;&s;edly, upon the divine principle of philanthropy; and there are two apo&s;trophe's in them, which are both &s;triking and affecting. In the mid&s;t of
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
a mo&s;t moving de&s;cription of a complicated family di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;uddenly interrupts him&s;elf with this humane exclamation: <HI>Look down, O God, upon their afflictions!</HI> and then pro|ceeds with his narrative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermon 2d, page 41.</NOTE>. Again, he is telling the &s;tory of the good Samaritan, and after the&s;e words, <HI>by chance there came by a certain prie&s;t,</HI> he cries out, <HI>Merciful God! that a teacher of thy religion &s;hould ever want humanity</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sermon 3d, page 53.</NOTE>! For my part, were I a bi&s;hop, I would not indeed prefer him to a <HI>Cure,</HI> (though I am glad that he does not want one) becau&s;e of his <HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> but I would certainly make him my <HI>Vicar-general,</HI> on account of his <HI>Yoric.</HI></P>
<P>As to tho&s;e few free pa&s;&s;ages, which the reader may find inter&s;per&s;ed throughout the&s;e writings of mine, if rightly appre|hended, in context with the whole, they may be compared to the <HI>anamorpho&s;is</HI> in painting; which is an innocent art of draw|ing a picture &s;o equivocally, that, accord|ing
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
to the light it is viewed in, may pre&s;ent you either with a &s;atyr, or a &s;aint; or like Minerva's ring, which could render Uly&s;&s;es hand&s;ome or ugly, ju&s;t as he found it ex|pedient to carry on his purpo&s;e.</P>

All which apologies I do here mo&s;t cor|dially invite <HI>Mr. Sterne</HI> to take &s;hare of with me; for by all accounts, his private character de&s;erves it.</P>
<P>And really, if I did not interlope, now and then, to the great relief of my readers, what would the&s;e two volumes be good for? would they defray the printing?

<HEAD>PROLOGOMENA TO THE SUBSCRIBERS.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I had never publi&s;hed any book before, I had not attained the lea&s;t knowledge in the arts of <HI>puffing off</HI> a work; and as I had &s;eldom conver&s;ed, except among the learned and good, I had con&s;equently but few ac|quaintances: I was therefore alarmed at the certain expence of an impre&s;&s;ion, at my own &s;uit, on the precarious hazard of a
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
&s;ale. Upon which I determined with my|&s;elf, to have a &s;ub&s;cription &s;olicited, in or|der to defray the charges of printing.</P>
<P>The trouble of this bu&s;ine&s;s I left intirely on the hands of my book&s;ellor; upon who&s;e counter al&s;o, I laid the manu&s;cript, to be dipt into, here and there, by the &s;ub&s;cri|bers, in order to afford them &s;ome &s;peci|men of the work. And while this &s;cheme was going on, it has amu&s;ed me often, to &s;it unnoticed in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner of the &s;hop, attending to the que&s;tions and ob&s;er|vations which the cu&s;tomers u&s;ed to throw out, when the <HI>propo&s;als</HI> happened to be put into their hands.</P>
<P><Q>The Triumvirate&mdash;Very well &mdash; Pray Mr. Folio, is this the Triumvirate of Cae&s;ar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar.</NOTE>, Anthony, and Lepidus? or</Q>&mdash; <HI>Neither, Sir.</HI> <Q>No, no, I &s;ee now it could not be that, for though A. and C. may very well &s;tand for Anthony and Cae&s;ar, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;queeze Lepidus out of B. Nay, nor can it mean the former Triumvirate neither, for &s;tronger rea&s;ons &s;till, of the &s;ame kind.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, Pompey, and Cra&s;&s;us.</NOTE> </Q>Why really,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
Sir, replied Mr. Folio, I do not think that there is the lea&s;t mention of any one of tho&s;e antiquated gentlemen, from one end to t'other of the&s;e writings. The per&s;ons here intended, may be walking about the &s;treets every day, for aught I know; and 'tis odds but you might know one or other of them your&s;elf, if Mr. Triglyph would but &s;uffer me to publi&s;h their names; for tho&s;e of A. B. and C. you mu&s;t under&s;tand, Sir, are but their <HI>incog-nomens</HI>&mdash;I think that this was the expre&s;&s;ion Mr. Triglyph made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>When people have taken up the manu|&s;cript, it has often entertained me to hear the &s;everal remarks which have been made, upon looking into it. Some have cried out, Zounds, what a world of moral &s;tuff is here! By the Lord, a man may as well &s;it down and read the Bible&mdash;Every whit, indeed Sir, replied &s;ober Folio. What the devil have we got here? &s;ays another, opening in a different place. O, by <HI>Mars, Bacchus, Apollo,</HI> and <HI>virorum</HI> too, this &s;cene licks <HI>Shandy</HI> all to nothing&mdash;Nay, now d&mdash;n
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
my eyes, Tri&s;tram, but this thru&s;ts your no&s;e out of joint, wor&s;e than the <HI>forceps.</HI></P>
<P>Another critic, upon looking into the &s;everal parts of the book, pronounced with a preci&s;e and dogmatic tone, that it wanted the true <HI>&s;implex duntaxat, et unum,</HI> and that there was &s;uch a variety of characters, &s;ub|jects, &s;tiles, &s;entiments, and manners, mixed together in this <HI>multifarious</HI> work, it could never be <HI>one man's money,</HI> that's pos&mdash;and therefore the impre&s;&s;ion would certainly ne|ver <HI>bring a &s;ale.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this hint I carried home the ma|nu&s;cript, and drew out &s;pecimens of the different &s;pecies of writing, &s;ubjects, cha|racters, &amp;c. and gave them to Mr. Folio, to &s;elect one or other of them, according to his particular knowledge of the re&s;pective genius of each &s;ub&s;criber; who taking it for granted, that the intire work would be car|ried on in the &s;ame &s;train, might the more readily enter into a &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>This device produced a mo&s;t &s;udden and lucky effect, and my friend Folio very &s;oon received ca&s;h &s;ufficient to put the&s;e &s;heets
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">
into the pre&s;s; to which I think proper to prefix a li&s;t of the &s;ub&s;cribers, in the very manner I copied it out from his books, when I was &s;ettling accounts with him, upon this article. In which catalogue you are to ob&s;erve, that where he has put down the names, as in the fir&s;t column, it was of &s;uch per&s;ons only, who without knowing any thing in particular of the work, &s;ub|&s;cribed merely at the reque&s;t of a friend, or to incourage the freedom of the pre&s;s; to fill up a gap on their &s;helves, or for the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing their names, or titles, in print: that where the &s;ub&s;cribers were too mode&s;t to have their names mentioned, or too nu|merous to be in&s;erted, they are cla&s;&s;ed un|der <HI>character,</HI> as in the &s;econd column.

<P>_HIS hor&s;e grew tired before he had earned half his hire; &s;o that it was late at night before Mr. Carewe had reached the inn at Scarborough. The reader mu&s;t have been a lucky traveller, if he does not know that the bea&s;t, whether through &s;ympathy, electricity, contac|tity, or any other word, <HI>quod exit in</HI> y, commu|nicates its own fatigue to the rider, as if, mar|riage

or Centaur-like, they were but <HI>one fle&s;h.</HI> And, indeed, in many other in&s;tances in life, the tedious urging of a Per&s;on to an unwilling act, is often more tire&s;ome than the doing twice as much one&s;elf. Mr. Carewe eat a poached egg, drank a pint of negus, and retired to bed.</P>
<P>The next morning he went down early into the kitchen, to order his breakfa&s;t, where he met with &s;everal per&s;ons, on the &s;ame errand, and the landlord among them. He enquired of this latter, where or how near the town one Mr. Andrews lived, who he was informed had lately come to re&s;ide in that country. The ho&s;t replied, that he was &s;ettled, <HI>as well as he can be &s;ettled,</HI> on the northern road, about a mile from the town; that he was but little known in the Country, for that all his neighbours looked upon him to be mad, as he lived intirely at home, and &s;pent all his time in reading <HI>of books.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="30">A gentleman who &s;tood by, and had endea|voured to interrupt this declamation, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf at la&s;t to Mr. Carewe, &s;aid, You are not to take the character of that gentleman, Sir, from the de&s;cription of our ho&s;t here, for he may be one of the many who are incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between a <HI>common</HI> and a <HI>peculiar</HI> character; and fools, &s;aid he, are apt to impute every thing to frenzy, which ri&s;es above the ordinary level of dullne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Beville then propo&s;ed to Mr. Carewe, that they &s;hould breakfa&s;t together, as he &s;hould be extremely plea&s;ed to cultivate an acquaintance with any per&s;on who might have the lea&s;t &s;ocial connection with his amiable friend Mr. Andrews. Mr. Carewe bowed with that ea&s;e and compla|cency that was natural to him, and &s;tretching forth his hand toward the door, &s;aid, in effect, Sir, I am ready to attend you.</P>
<P>During breakfa&s;t they conver&s;ed familiarly to|gether, upon general topics of politics and let|ters, and did not, like attorneys, proceed im|mediately to the purpo&s;e of their meeting. There is in ingenuous minds, under the advantages of a liberal education, a certain native freedom, and a well-bred ea&s;e, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, ren|der perfect &s;trangers as familiar, as if they had been old and intimate acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="31">At length Mr. Beville &s;aid, that he had come that morning from Mr. Andrews's hou&s;e, as he u&s;ually did every day, to drink the waters, and bathe in the the &s;ea, for a di&s;order which he had been for &s;ome time &s;ubject to, namely, the &s;curvy; which <HI>in&s;ulars</HI> are generally afflicted with, and is the root whence all the rotten branches of di&s;tempers, peculiar to nations &s;ur|rounded by the ocean, u&s;ually &s;pring. He then a&s;ked Mr. Carewe where, and how long he had been acquainted with Mr. Andrews.</P>
<P>He told his name, and was proceeding to give him a particular account of his acquaint|ance and attachment to Mr. Andrews, when he was interrupted by an exclamation, O, Sir, I have you all <HI>by heart,</HI> already; I have frequently heard our friend mention you with the highe&s;t fondne&s;s and e&s;teem; lament, of late, his not knowing where to direct a line to you, and of|ten wi&s;h, after his warm manner, that &s;ome fortuitous concour&s;e might happily throw us three together, in &s;ome retired &s;cene, where we might mutually know, approve, and rejoice in each other. This fortunate cri&s;is, added he, has at length arrived, and I am impatient to make the welcome pre&s;ent to my friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe bowed, they embraced, di&s;charg|ed their bill, and walked away together to the
<PB N="5" REF="32">
<HI>farm,</HI> as it was &s;tiled, where they found Mr. An|drews reading in an Arbour in his garden, hav|ing ju&s;t retired from the heat of the day, after pointing out &s;ome works to his labourers.</P>

<P>I Would here de&s;cribe the meeting of Mr. An|drews and Mr. Carewe, but for the follow|ing rea&s;ons. You have &s;een two friends meet, therefore to you it would be &s;uperfluous. Or, more probably, you might never have &s;een two <HI>friends</HI> together, any way, in your olde&s;t life; &s;o that to you it might appear improbable. For it was not like two merchants meeting upon <HI>Change;</HI> it was not like two ju&s;tices &s;aluting at a &s;e&s;&s;ions; nor even like two neighbours &s;haking each other's arms out of the &s;ockets, at a fair. In &s;hort, it was not like any thing you may have ever &s;een, except you have had the extraor|dinary chance of being pre&s;ent on the meeting of two friends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>There was &s;peech in their dumbne&s;s, language in their very ge&s;ture: They looked as they had heard of a world ran&s;omed, or one de&s;troyed: A notable pa&s;&s;ion of wonder appeared in them; but the wi&s;e&s;t beholder, that knew no more but &s;eeing, could not &s;ay if the im|portance were joy or &s;orrow; but in the extremity of the one it mu&s;t needs be.</Q>

<P><PB N="6" REF="33">But then you are to ob&s;erve, that, by this ex|pre&s;&s;ion, I do not mean &s;uch connections as the moderns, by way of compo&s;ition with morals, are reduced to a&s;cribe that high title to; but &s;uch friends as may be quoted from among the antients,
<Q>"In this dull age &s;carce under&s;tood."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buckingham upon this &s;ubject, in his ode on Brutus.</NOTE></Q>
between whom, and the pre&s;ent race, there is as much difference, as between the man that Diogenes was &s;earching for, at Athens, and tho&s;e who, ignorant of the reproof, laughed at his extravagance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diogenes, ob&s;erving that the whole State of Athens had &s;unk into debauchery and corruption, and meaning to reproach them for having dwindled from the original dig|nity of human nature, walked through the city at noon, with a lighted torch in his hand, and being a&s;ked what he was in &s;earch of? an&s;wered, I am looking for <HI>a Man.</HI></NOTE>.

For a <HI>true man</HI> is a <HI>real friend.</HI> But the qualities which are requi&s;ite to con&s;titute this
<PB N="7" REF="34">
character, have been &s;o long lo&s;t in the world, that Cicero cries out, even in his time, <HI>Haec genera virtutem non &s;olum in moribus no&s;tris, &s;ed vix jam in libris reperiuntur: Chartae quoque, quae i|lam pri&s;tinam &s;everitatem continebant, ob&s;oleverunt.</HI></P>
<P>Epicurus, in his morals, prefers friend&s;hip before any other virtue. St. Evremond &s;ays, that <Q>ju&s;tice is only a moral, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the convenience of human &s;ociety; it is the work of man; whereas friend&s;hip is the work of nature.</Q> One might imagine that the <HI>Saint</HI> had Love rather, in contemplation, in this definition. I carry the &s;ubject higher, and deem friend&s;hip to be an angelic virtue. Nay, higher &s;till. For friend&s;hip proceeds farther than the <HI>having care over us.</HI> It will induce us to &s;acrifice even our&s;elves for its &s;ake, and therefore ap|proaches nearer to the excellence of a God&mdash;<HI>A God who died for us!</HI></P>
<P>And here I confe&s;s, that I feel &s;o &s;trong an impul&s;e upon me, to acquaint my readers with my own &s;ituation in life, with regard to this par|ticular, that I cannot refrain from letting them know, one and all of them, which I hope, in other words, will be every one who can read Engli&s;h, that I have &s;ufficient rea&s;on, from a long experience of my own, joined to the ac|counts I have occa&s;ionally received from others,
<PB N="8" REF="35">
to affirm, that I have been all my life placed under the patronage of all the real and di&s;in|tere&s;ted friends in the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>And as a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of my obligations, upon this account, calls on me here, for proper ac|knowledgements, the <HI>thread</HI> of my &s;tory pre&s;&s;ing me, at the &s;ame time, not to di&s;continue its <HI>weft,</HI> I &s;hall beg leave to refer the curious reader to my appendix to this volume, pages fir&s;t and &s;econd, for a full and true account of this mat|ter; and in the third and fourth pages, ditto appendix, he will find a catalogue of the many and great benefits which I have my&s;elf received, and which others may al&s;o derive, from &s;uch advantageous clientcies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the u&s;ual que&s;tions and unu&s;ual tran&s;ports were over, Mr. Carewe de&s;ired Mr. Andrews to &s;hew him his deme&s;ne, his hu&s;|bandry and improvements, which he replied he would do, without &s;tirring out of the &s;pot; and taking out a pocket-book, he opened a map, <HI>of forty perch to the inch,</HI> in which he &s;hewed him the whole farm, neatly laid down, divided and
<PB N="9" REF="36">
denominated, as the <HI>wheatfield,</HI> the <HI>meadow,</HI> the <HI>pigeon-park, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr. Andrews had fully in&s;tructed him in the topography of the draught, you may be &s;urpri&s;ed perhaps, &s;aid he, at this conci&s;e and figurative manner of an&s;wering your reque&s;t; but, in general, people propo&s;e this que&s;tion, more out of complai&s;ance than curio&s;ity, while others accord it out of o&s;tentation, rather than good-will. And, as vanity is ever more active than civility, I have &s;ometimes known an old gouty fellow fatigue his grand&s;on, in leading him round an improvement of his own making. And yet, after all his &s;weat and toil, think you, added he, that he would know &s;o much of the matter, or be able to de&s;cribe the place &s;o well to others, as he might from &s;uch a diagram as this, without moving any thing more than a finger or an eye.</P>
<P>But with regard to the plan now before you, continued he, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve one thing to you, which otherwi&s;e might require your going to the &s;everal clo&s;es, to inform your&s;elf of. You would naturally imagine, from the different de|nominations, that the pigeon-park had a dove|hou&s;e in it; that the meadow &s;upplied my &s;ta|bles with hay; the wheatfield &s;upported my family with bread; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="37">But not one &s;yllable of all this, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir. The&s;e divi&s;ions indeed, I &s;uppo&s;e had been originally named from re&s;pective merits of the kind; and, like other <HI>titles,</HI> the&s;e are &s;till re|tained, though the qualifications which formerly gave ri&s;e to them have long &s;ince &s;urcea&s;ed. And in truth, added he, I have generally con&s;i|dered all the parade of heraldry, in the &s;ame light; for, re&s;pecting <HI>qualities,</HI> not <HI>quality,</HI> I am apt to &s;tile &s;ome <HI>peers of the realm,</HI> in allu&s;ion to my own deme&s;ne, by the <HI>cognomens</HI> of <HI>pigeon-park, meadow, wheatfield, &amp;c.</HI> who, as Sir Ri|chard Steele &s;ays of a Grub&s;treet paper, can pro|duce no merit beyond the <HI>title. Titles</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;h not merit, are but <HI>nick names;</HI> as a deformed man or woman are in deri&s;ion &s;tiled my lord or my lady.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE hou&s;e was &s;ituated exactly as the learned Dr. Cheyne recommends, in his E&s;&s;ay on Health and Long Life. Fronting the ea&s;t, to receive the full benefit of the fir&s;t &s;un: on the &s;ide of a gravelly hill, that the foundation may be dry: over a running water, to give a
<PB N="11" REF="38">
motion to the air; and unincumbered with trees, which are apt to confine the damps, and keep them hovering about the man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was what was &s;tiled <HI>a Batchelor's Lodge,</HI> but &s;o well contrived, that, if Mr. An|drews &s;hould ever <HI>double</HI> his condition, he might, at the &s;ame time, double his hou&s;e too, without having occa&s;ion to alter any part of the building; for his was not a &s;mall <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> but rather <HI>half a large one.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I here freely make a pre&s;ent of this di&s;tinction, to the ingenious modern architects of <HI>Chine&s;e orders;</HI> and as terms of art are nece&s;&s;ary toward the conci&s;ene&s;s of &s;ciences, I &s;hall dub it with the technic of <HI>dimagdom&eacute;,</HI> which I have mo&s;t learnedly compounded from the words <HI>dimidium magnae dom&ucirc;s, vel domi.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>A neglect of this &s;ort of oeconomy, is too generally &s;een in mo&s;t of the villa's of young men of fortune; who are apt &s;eldom to frame any purpo&s;e beyond the pre&s;ent expediency; which &s;ubjects them frequently, as future con|tingencies may happen, to the aukwardne&s;s of di&s;proportioned additions, the inconvenience of <HI>returns,</HI> or <HI>traps for whirling eddies,</HI> the expence of altering what has been already built, or of ra&s;ing the whole, to begin again anew. In oeconomy, as well as morals, the frolic of the &s;ea&s;on, &s;hould never be incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;cheme for life.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="39">The furniture was perfectly <HI>&s;implex munditiis,</HI> and, according to the precept of Marcus Varro, in his E&s;&s;ay on Entertainment, <HI>rather neat than fine, elegant than rich.</HI> The bed&s;teads, chairs, and tables were all of oak or walnut, becau&s;e of our own growth; and the curtains, &s;eats, and hangings, of &s;tamped linnen; becau&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Andrews, it is our own manufacture, looks hand&s;ome at fir&s;t, and, that the being obliged to have it wa&s;hed &s;ometimes, renews its fre&s;hne&s;s, and <HI>gives employment to the poor.</HI></P>
<P>Such was Mr. Andrews's expre&s;&s;ion, and quite in his manner, who con&s;tantly took advantage of every opportunity of inculcating the god-like virtue, and &s;oul-&s;aving moral, of charity and benevolence. Here now, had I been inclined to have &s;welled my volume by notes, I might have introduced the word <HI>philanthropy,</HI> in this place, in&s;tead of <HI>benevolence,</HI> which would have afforded me the opportunity of informing the generality of my <HI>polite readers,</HI> that <HI>philanthropy</HI> is a plaguy hard Greek word, which in down|right plain Engli&s;h means nothing more than <HI>a love of mankind.</HI></P>
<P>But in the fir&s;t place, the writer of the&s;e me|moirs, is far above &s;uch <HI>bibliopoli&s;t</HI> arts; and, in the next, the word <HI>philanthropy</HI> would not have &s;ufficiently comprehended the full &s;cope of
<PB N="13" REF="40">
Mr. Andrews's benevolence; for his was not confined to human nature alone, but extended it&s;elf throughout the whole animal creation, from the Leviathan of the deep, to the emmet of the field. And, in order to awaken &s;uch &s;entiments among his dome&s;tics, along with other devices for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he had placed this text over his &s;table door, <HI>A righteous man regardeth the life of a bea&s;t.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they came into the parlour, they found dinner &s;erved; which was a true <HI>mona&s;tic</HI> meal; only one joint of mutton, and a &s;allad. But they were all in health, eat heartily, and conver&s;ed chearfully together. Mr. An|drews ob&s;erved upon the frugality of his board, but a&s;&s;ured his friends, that this oeconomy pro|ceeded more from Epicuri&s;m, than par&s;imony; for that he had always perceived an higher reli&s;h to one di&s;h, than to many; and that various meats were apt to perplex the choice, and weaken the appetite, by dividing its ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="41">Mr. Beville took occa&s;ion, from this hint, to philo&s;ophize upon this &s;ubject, by remarking that &s;ingle objects are better ob&s;erved by the eye, than plural ones; that variety in pro&s;pect, like many angles in architecture, di&s;tracts the vi&s;ion, in&s;tead of filling the &s;ight; and that the &s;ea engages the attention of the mind, as much from its uniformity, as its va&s;tne&s;s. In fine, that variety in general rather diverts, than &s;ati&s;|fies the eye.</P>
<P>Mr. Carewe wrought the &s;ubject &s;till higher, by running the analogy into a moral, &s;aying, that in love, as well as food, a craving for variety was the certain &s;ign of a &s;ickly appetite; that temperance and con&s;tancy were the be&s;t pre&s;er|vatives of health and vigour; and that, as pro|vidence pur&s;ues its &s;everal purpo&s;es by uniform means, it might not be unrea&s;onable to con|clude, that a fondne&s;s for change was more con|&s;onant to a &s;tate of depravation, than of nature.</P>
<P>After this manner did they cover&s;e together, in the &s;pirit of antient &s;ympo&s;iac's, during their meal, a bottle of wine, and a pot of coffee. After which Mr. Andrews a&s;ked Mr. Carewe, whether he cho&s;e to play cards; to which he replied, that he had no particular inclination to any amu&s;ements of that kind, but was always ready to comply with the di&s;po&s;ition of his com|pany;
<PB N="15" REF="42">
and de&s;ired Mr. Andrews, as <HI>ma&s;ter of the revels,</HI> to appoint the entertainment for his gue&s;ts. No, Sir, interrupted Mr. Andrews, I do not under&s;tand the punctilio in that &s;en&s;e; for I con&s;ider a man in his own hou&s;e, to be a ma&s;ter to his dome&s;tics only, but to his friends a va&s;&s;al. However, as you &s;ay, Sir, added Mr. Beville, that you are ready to comply with the humour of the company, I &s;hall make &s;o free as to acquaint you, that neither Mr. An|drews, nor I, chu&s;e play of any kind.</P>
<P>Agreed, replied Mr. Carewe, for my part, 'tis compliance, and not choice, that ever induces me to &s;it down at a card-table. There are three things requi&s;ite to a game&s;ter; a love of play, a knowledge in its <HI>my&s;teries,</HI> and a fortune to &s;up|port it&mdash;or better, no fortune to lo&s;e. In every one of which, I am my&s;elf deficient. Nay, I mu&s;t always play at a <HI>di&s;advantage,</HI> even upon <HI>equal terms,</HI> for the winning of fifty guineas could not make me happy, and the lo&s;ing of them might render me unea&s;y. I have por|tioned out my income in a certain even propor|tion, and think that it would be extremely indi&s;|creet in me to &s;take any part of it upon a hazard, which might injure my oeconomy, without im|proving my fortune: for fifty guineas are more

than I want, and are, at the &s;ame time, more than I can &s;pare.</P>

<P>UPON which they retired to the library, where, after &s;ome general conver&s;ation, which the &s;cene both hinted and in&s;pired, Mr. Carewe repeated to Mr. Andrews the di&s;|cour&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning, at Scarborough, between the ho&s;t and him. Mr. Andrews &s;miled, and replied, that mo&s;t of his pre&s;ent neighbours, as well as &s;ome former ac|quaintances in life, had conceived the &s;ame notion of him, becau&s;e he had generally &s;eque&s;|tered him&s;elf from the world, and mixed not in their &s;ports or entertainments, their races, cock-fightings, hunting-matches, or play.</P>
<P>In all things of an indifferent nature, &s;aid he, one &s;hould certainly conform to the manners of the world, in order to avoid the un&s;ociable and affected character of &s;ingularity; but in reality, added he, the&s;e things are by no means indifferent to me, and I am &s;o far from having any manner of ta&s;te or pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch amu&s;e|ments, that I rather feel a di&s;reli&s;h to &s;ome of
<PB N="17" REF="44">
them, and an ab&s;olute aver&s;ion, even to horror, to others.</P>
<P>I have, continued he, made experiments upon every article in life, which bears the name of plea&s;ure; and the fir&s;t thing that di&s;gu&s;ted me was a crowd. I ran headlong into all manner of public places, with that giddy eagerne&s;s of youth, which is natural, before one has given them&s;elves lei&s;ure to enquire either into the ends or motives of their actions. But, after having &s;u&s;tained much &s;queezing, &s;weating, and jo&s;tling, at balls, fea&s;ts, &s;hews, and ma&s;querades, for many years, I began to find out the true defini|tion of a crowd, to be, <HI>a certain combination of an indifinite number of per&s;ons, to render each other mutually unea&s;y.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry, in the &s;eries of letters, &s;ays, I will forgive none but a <HI>pick-pocket</HI> for loving a crowd.</NOTE></P>
<P>And be&s;ides, with regard to the boi&s;terous and unmeaning mirth one is generally &s;tunned with, in large companies, which may be &s;tiled, not the <HI>conver&s;ations,</HI> but the <HI>convul&s;ions</HI> of &s;ociety, I have always looked upon laughing, without &s;en|timent, to be merely hi&s;terical, and needed the aid of <HI>a&s;&s;a foetida.</HI> I have &s;ometimes imagined, that, in the days of antient philo&s;ophy, when men u&s;ed to give rational rebukes, but after an
<PB N="18" REF="45">
ab&s;urd manner, as in the in&s;tance of Diogenes and his torch, mentioned ju&s;t now, and many others, one of the Sages would have brought a wet mop into &s;uch a merry-making a&s;&s;embly, and have twirled it in their faces, as &s;uppo&s;ing them to be falling into fits. Ri&s;ibility has been made a character of rationality; the conclu&s;ion then mu&s;t be fairly this, that none &s;hould laugh without a rea&s;on; otherwi&s;e, <HI>looking a&s;quint</HI> might be as di&s;tingui&s;hing a mark, as &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers have made it.</P>
<P>With regard to hor&s;e-racing, be&s;ides the crowd and noi&s;e which attend it, there is &s;ome|thing much more abominable in it. For, not to in&s;i&s;t merely upon the cruelty of &s;training a beautiful and u&s;eful creature beyond the extent of its powers, and running the poor animal with whip and &s;pur for many miles, <HI>in blood,</HI> which is the jockey's expre&s;&s;ion, is it not an encourage|ment to the idlene&s;s of the lower cla&s;&s;es of peo|ple, who are the riches of a nation? are not the bettors generally either dupes or &s;harpers? and is not the immorality of &s;uch proceedings freed, by cu&s;tom, even from the re&s;traint of &s;hame? For, are not the mo&s;t flagrant impo&s;itions quali|fied by the title of <HI>a jocky &s;troke,</HI> and ju&s;tified by <HI>the laws of the turf?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="46">Cock-fighting too, makes a barbarous &s;port of courage, wounds, and death! Does the ge|nerous animal win an hard fought battle, at the expence of blood, or limb; what is his reward? <HI>To have his head wrung off,</HI> after his bravery has rendered him unfit for fighting any more But <HI>the tryal,</HI> or <HI>cutting down</HI> of cocks, is too &s;hock|ing for humanity to de&s;cribe!</P>
<P>As for hunting, I have always thought that the only <HI>rational creature</HI> that pur&s;ues this &s;port, is the hound; for he follows his <HI>in&s;tinct:</HI> I excu&s;e the hunt&s;man, becau&s;e he is acting in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion: I pity the hor&s;e, as he is pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice; but I de&s;pi&s;e the 'Squire, having nei|ther compul&s;ion, vocation, or natural impul&s;e to plead. The only plau&s;ible apology I ever heard given, in defence of this diver&s;ion, is, that it conduces to health, by inducing to exer|ci&s;e. But is not this rather wor&s;e than giving up the argument intirely? Is it not, in effect, to &s;ay, that a man cannot do a <HI>rational</HI> thing, with|out having an <HI>irrational</HI> motive for it?</P>
<P>Gaming I need not expatiate upon; many writers, of &s;en&s;e and morals, have already done &s;o, and without effect. Even in its mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tate, it cannot be &s;aid to be <HI>innocent,</HI> but merely <HI>idle.</HI> It is a mi&s;application of <HI>accountable time, pereunt, &amp; imputantur;</HI> and apt to awaken pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="20" REF="47">
which had much better remain a&s;leep. Herodotus tells us, that play was invented fir&s;t in Lydia, at the time of a great famine, by way of diverting the pre&s;&s;ing calls of hunger: And hath it not, long &s;ince, returned back again to its primitive in&s;titution, by &s;upporting an infinite number of per&s;ons, who have no other trade, merit, profe&s;&s;ion, or vi&s;ible fortune to keep them&s;elves from &s;tarving, without the relief of &s;uch <HI>handicraft,</HI> or <HI>moyens de vivre?</HI></P>
<P>The conver&s;ation here took another turn, and was carried on for the remainder of the evening upon various topics, till they were called in to &s;upper, where the &s;ame frugality appeared as at dinner. A roa&s;ted fowl, and a bottle of white|wine, which they diluted with Spa-water, com|pleated the repa&s;t. They parted at eleven, and retired to bed.</P>

<P>THE next morning Mr. Andrews and Mr. Carewe met at breakfa&s;t; but Mr. Be|ville had gone off, as u&s;ual, to drink the waters at Scarborough. After they had taken a few turns in the Garden, and returned into the &s;tudy,

Mr. Carewe put Mr. Andrews in mind of a pro|mi&s;e he had formerly made him, on their part|ing at I&s;lington, of relating to him the hi&s;tory of his life, if ever they might happen to meet again.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews acknowledged the debt, and &s;aid that he would take the lucky opportunity of Mr. Beville's ab&s;ence, to di&s;charge it, as it would &s;upply him with an occa&s;ion of introdu|cing his friend's mo&s;t excellent character, and al&s;o of mentioning &s;ome circum&s;tances which would revive his grief, as they will nece&s;&s;arily do my own, added he, with a &s;igh! his tears flowing fa&s;t at the &s;ame time. He remained for &s;ome minutes unable to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and then, after having made Mr. Carewe acknow|ledge that the obligation was mutual between them, in this particular, he proceeded thus:</P>

<HEAD>The &s;tory of Mr. <HI>Andrews</HI> and Mr. <HI>Beville.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was at &s;chool, &s;aid he, I had conceived a particular attachment to|ward one of my condi&s;ciples, for an odd rea&s;on indeed, but it is &s;uch a one as makes mothers often fond of &s;ickly or ungracious children, merely for the trouble they give them. He hap|pened,
<PB N="22" REF="49">
however, to be my chum, which fir&s;t accidentally led me to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the re&s;t. He was arch, lively, and idle; but, as his humour had a peculiar charm for my gravity, I u&s;ed frequently to make his <HI>exerci&s;es</HI> for him, furni&s;h his <HI>themes,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the con&s;truc|tion of his <HI>le&s;&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>As he was quick of re&s;entment, and well-&s;pirited, he had frequent <HI>boxing bouts</HI> upon his hands, and &s;eldom waited to con&s;ider the odds again&s;t him; but, whenever I &s;aw him over|powered, I u&s;ed to enter the li&s;ts in his defence; and, as I was by much the bigge&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t boy in the &s;chool, none of the re&s;t would ven|ture to cope with me, but u&s;ed to cry out, <HI>Cla&s;s, cla&s;s,</HI> upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and then a whole form would ru&s;h down <HI>pell-mell</HI> again&s;t me.</P>
<P>You'll pardon me, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Andrews, for this puerile detail; but one has naturally a fondne&s;s for dwelling upon tho&s;e early &s;cenes of life, and renewing their youth, as it were, by the recollection of pa&s;t aera's. <HI>Haec olim memini&s;&s;e.</HI> But I &s;hall now pa&s;s on to our riper years, after having made this philo&s;ophic reflection; that it mu&s;t certainly be <HI>nature,</HI> and not <HI>habit,</HI> which has given men a greater bravery than women, for boys univer&s;ally decide their quarrels by boxing, even before education can have pointed

<P>THE intimacy, between this friend and me, continued after we had quitted &s;chool. I &s;till retained the &s;ame fondne&s;s and attachment toward him, though without any manner of e&s;teem. He was a character, he had wit and humour, but was di&s;&s;olute and capricious. He had chearfulne&s;s and good-nature, but was pa&s;&s;ionate and ill-tempered. He would &s;acrifice his fortune for you to day, and to-morrow re|fu&s;e you a guinea. In fine, he was a good com|panion, but a bad friend; and one of tho&s;e whom one is generally plea&s;ed at meeting with, but never regret the parting from.</P>
<P>Our different manners of life, not le&s;s than our &s;eparate vocations, would frequently divide us from each other, &s;ometimes for many months to|gether; but whenever his frolic or extravagance, as was often the ca&s;e, happened to involve him in any difficulty, his fir&s;t re&s;ort was to my coun|&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have bailed him out of
<PB N="24" REF="51">
goals, relea&s;ed him from the watch, and re|deemed him out of bagnio's. I have been his <HI>&s;econd</HI> in &s;ome encounters, and his mar&s;hal of honour in others.</P>
<P>In fine, his giddine&s;s and debaucheries drew upon me &s;o much trouble, hazard, and &s;candal, that I have frequently re&s;olved to withdraw my|&s;elf intirely from any manner of connection with him, and &s;hould certainly have done &s;o, but that I knew he had no other friend, either wil|ling, or &s;ober enough, to guard him from &s;crapes, or to relieve him out of them; his other a&s;&s;ociates being at lea&s;t as idle and thoughtle&s;s as him&s;elf, and &s;ome of them even more &s;o: And yet, he generally kept what the world is too apt to &s;tile <HI>the be&s;t company.</HI></P>
<P>He was placed by his guardians at a college in Cambridge, where he loitered away his time for about three years, and u&s;ed to make frequent elopements to London, where I re&s;ided at that time, with my father. While he remained at the univer&s;ity, he u&s;ed to write often to me, and, as there was &s;ome wit, &s;pirit, and whim in his letters, I have kept mo&s;t of them by me, which I &s;hall entertain you with, &s;ome other time, added he, looking out at the window, for I now perceive our friend Mr. Beville return|ing from Scarborough, and we'll go out and
<PB N="25" REF="52">
meet him, if you plea&s;e, and inquire what news he may have pickt up in that gay, idle &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipated life.</P>
<P>The&s;e three friends pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of that day in the &s;ame kind of liberal conver&s;e as before, and the next morning, after Mr. Beville had walked away to town, in cour&s;e, and, as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, Mr. Andrews re|a&s;&s;umed as follows:</P>

<P>THE grace they repeat here, is about five mi|nutes long. How much mu&s;t the gro&s;s ideas of beef and pudding impure the hungry

&s;tudent's devotion, during that interval? I have often thought the marriage ritual too tedious, for the &s;ame pious rea&s;on. But, to make a ce|remony of a thing, which in it&s;elf is the farthe&s;t from ceremony of any thing in the world, is mo&s;t catholic non&s;en&s;e, &s;urely!</P>
<P>Long prayers, vigils, fa&s;ts, and penances, are certainly mo&s;t dangerous in&s;titutions. If the devotee be a cool per&s;on, they abate his zeal to <HI>lukewarm;</HI> and, if one of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, he is inflamed to <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> which are either above or below the proper temper of true devotion. Religion is love; and all its acts &s;hould be <HI>&s;hort and ex&s;tatic..</HI></P>
<P>I was hurried into this expre&s;&s;ion, my dear Andrews, and would have corrected it for your prudery, but that I happened to recollect doc|tor Taylor, in his &s;evere treati&s;e on <HI>holy living and dying,</HI> &s;peaking on the imperfection of all human plea&s;ures, introduces, among his in|&s;tances, the married virgin led by her para|nymphs to <HI>unea&s;y joy.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bridemen or bridemaids, indifferently u&s;ed.</NOTE></P>

&s;ays, that the highe&s;t of mortal plea&s;ures is at|tended with a <HI>&s;ort of fainting.</HI></P>

<P>I AM impatient to acquaint my dear Men|tor, how well I have extricated my&s;elf out of a difficulty, for the fir&s;t time, without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You may remember the Cambridge la&s;s I u&s;ed to toa&s;t to you when I was la&s;t in Lon|don, and prefer to all your belles on the Mall. Since my return, my love, my con&s;tancy, have been amply rewarded. I called her <HI>Amaryllis,</HI> &s;he &s;tiled me <HI>Celadon.</HI> I vowed, and &s;he be|lieved.</P>
<P>Our amour remained not long a &s;ecret. Be|tween <HI>unguarded innocence</HI> on one &s;ide, and giddy youth on the other, we &s;uffered &s;ome indi&s;cre|tions to e&s;cape us, <Q>leading to the door of truth,</Q> which alarmed her father, an huge hulking fellow, who dwelt on Gogmagog Hills, with a &s;our beetle in his brows, a &s;toop in his &s;houlders, a &s;tride in his gait, and a damnable &s;wing in his arms.</P>
<P>Methought, when he ru&s;hed into my cham|bers, he appeared as tremendous as my own
<PB N="29" REF="56">
<HI>Quinbus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quinbus Fle&s;trin, or the man-mountain, in Gulliver.</NOTE>, when he u&s;ed to pour down in my defence at &s;chool.

<P>Thus fortified in my moral, I immediately made the father this reply. If the account yon are come to call me to, Sir, be of <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> my &s;word &s;hall <HI>an&s;wer your waked wrath;</HI> but if of <HI>ju&s;tification,</HI> my oath is at your &s;ervice.

<P>Mr. Carewe was extremely entertained with the &s;pirit and humour of the&s;e letters, and &s;pent the re&s;t of this morning in peru&s;ing the re|mainder of the collection, while Mr. Andrews walked about his grounds; but I &s;hall not in|&s;ert any more of them here, becau&s;e I would not interrupt Mr. Andrews's &s;tory any longer, and that I de&s;ign &s;oon to publi&s;h the re&s;t of them, in a di&s;tinct volume from this work, if I &s;hall find that my readers give me &s;ufficient encou|ragement, by their reli&s;h of the foregoing &s;pe|cimens.</P>

<P>ABOUT a year before my friend became of age, continued Mr. Andrews, he quitted college, and came up to London, to con&s;ult the phy&s;icians about his health, which appeared, at
<PB N="34" REF="61">
that time, to be in a dangerous &s;tate, inclining to a decay. While he remained in town, he lived intirely with me, at my Father's; and re|&s;trained him&s;elf within a very regular and ab&s;te|mious cour&s;e, which I complimented him upon, as his then invalid condition had been brought upon him by free living and riot. To which he replied, after his lively manner, that there was a moral in exce&s;s, as it induced &s;obriety, more than a folio upon temperance.</P>
<P>When he began to recruit a little in London, the phy&s;icians ordered him down to Wind&s;or, for the air. Here his health was e&s;tabli&s;hed in about &s;ix months, mo&s;t of which time I &s;pent with him there, admini&s;tering his medicines with my own hands, and re&s;training him within the bounds of his regimen; which was no ea&s;y matter, after his &s;trength began to be re&s;tored again.</P>
<P>I took the advantage of this interval, to incul|cate &s;ome &s;ober reflections, with a due &s;en&s;e of religion, into his heart and mind; and my lec|tures &s;eemed to produce their proper effect, &s;o far as they could &s;upport them&s;elves upon philo|&s;ophic principles. But whenever I happened to touch upon <HI>faith,</HI> or <HI>&s;y&s;tem,</HI> he would cut me &s;hort, by crying out, more of your <HI>argument,</HI> good Mr. orthodox, and le&s;s of your <HI>doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="62">In vain I u&s;ed to urge, that <HI>faith</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary to religion, as well as <HI>works,</HI> and that <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> was framed upon articles of <HI>belief.</HI> Not at all, would he reply, after his quick manner, faith is merely con&s;titutional, and a man can no more <HI>believe,</HI> than <HI>lift a weight</HI> beyond his natural &s;trength. And what are your &s;y&s;tems after all, added he, but the vi&s;ionary fabricks of metaphy&s;ical dreams? Divines take a <HI>text,</HI> as Dido did a <HI>hide,</HI> and, by quibbling, &s;licing, and &s;training, force it to in|clo&s;e an area large enough <HI>to build a city upon.</HI> But <HI>delenda e&s;t carthago</HI> is my motto, as well as Cato's.</P>
<P>The <HI>occult qualities</HI> in phy&s;ics, are laughed at, he would run on; in metaphy&s;ics the <HI>entities</HI> and <HI>quiddities</HI> are exploded al&s;o; the heart is placed right in anatomy, and all &s;cience has been purged by the rea&s;onings of the latter philo&s;ophy. 'Tis in religion alone, that prejudice &s;till keeps its ground, which makes it in danger of lo&s;ing its own; and, that error is &s;anctified, even to bla&s;phemy. Addi&s;on &s;ays, very ju&s;tly, <Q>that an ignorant devotee affronts the Divinity more than an athei&s;t; for 'tis better to di&s;believe a deity intirely, than to form any notions of him unworthy of the infinite perfection of his nature.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="63">In fine, concluded he, there can be no merit in ignorance, nor any virtue in error; and whatever contradicts the common principles of &s;en&s;e or &s;cience, can never be any part of a divine revelation. For philo&s;ophy, like <HI>Jacob's ladder,</HI> mounts us up, &s;tep by &s;tep, into the very pre|&s;ence of the Deity; but metaphy&s;ics re&s;emble the <HI>Laputan</HI> method of building a hou&s;e, <HI>from the top to the bottom.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mr. Andrews and Mr. Carewe entered into a di&s;qui&s;ition upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, Carewe taking part with the condi&s;ciple, and Andrews arguing in &s;upport of &s;y&s;tem; but, as their con|ver&s;ation on &s;uch topics would not much edify or entertain the reader, I &s;hall here leave Mr. Andrews at lei&s;ure to continue his memoirs, without any further interruption.</P>

<P>SOON after we had gone to re&s;ide at Wind|&s;or, pur&s;ued he, we happened to become acquainted with a young lady who lived in the town; of a good family and character, but of no fortune. Her father had an employment at
<PB N="37" REF="64">
the palace, of about three hundred pounds a year; had a wife, this daughter, and a &s;on, who is our worthy friend here, Mr. Beville. I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the evenings at their hou&s;e, that I could &s;pare from my invalid, and, when he was able to go abroad, he u&s;ed to come along with me, and frequently accompanied us upon little parties about the country.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Beville's &s;tature was rather below the middle &s;ize, but &s;he was finely made, and well fa&s;hioned; &s;he had a clear brown complexion, fine hair and teeth, a lively eye, with a great air of &s;en&s;ibility through her whole countenance. She had read mo&s;t of the polite Engli&s;h and French writers, and was perfectly accompli&s;hed in mu&s;ic and dancing: Her &s;en&s;e was of the right feminine kind, for it con&s;i&s;ted rather in a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and a delicate ta&s;te, than a &s;trong judgment.</P>
<P>She had a great ea&s;e and freedom in her man|ners; but at the &s;ame time &s;uch a nicety and decorum in all her behaviour, that our invalid, upon receiving a rebuke from her one day, for &s;ome liberties he had attempted, <HI>upon his return|ing health,</HI> &s;tiled her a <HI>rake-trap,</HI> and, with his u&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s, a&s;ked her, <Q>How the devil &s;hall a man know how to conduct him&s;elf to|ward &s;uch a woman as you are, who, like a
<PB N="38" REF="65">
cunning game&s;ter, leads one in by &s;uffering a trick or two of no con&s;equence, to pa&s;s, and, when he thinks the &s;take his own, pops the <HI>ten-ace</HI> upon him?</Q> Good breeding, Sir, replied Mi&s;s Beville, &s;hould conduct you&mdash; whoever has arrived at that polite character, will need no formal rules; and, without it, the whole <HI>academy of compliments</HI> will not be &s;ufficient to in|&s;truct you.</P>
<P>They had frequent &s;quabbles of the &s;ame kind together, while I continued always to behave toward her, both in &s;peech and action, with that propriety and re&s;pect, which mode&s;t women of all ranks have a right to challenge, from the prince to the pea&s;ant. Which conduct appa|rently gained me the preference in her regards and e&s;teem, before my friend, though he was younger, hand&s;omer, more lively, and had a very con&s;iderable fortune.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he perceived him&s;elf re&s;tored to health, he retired down to his e&s;tate in Corn|wall; and from that time &s;everal years elap&s;ed, before I heard any thing more of him; he re|&s;iding all the while at his &s;eat in the country, without making the lea&s;t overture toward a re|newal of our former corre&s;pondence; having, it &s;eems, le&s;s lei&s;ure to &s;pare from his <HI>&s;ports,</HI> than he had from his <HI>&s;tudies.</HI> But, though he had a
<PB N="39" REF="66">
lively warmth and earne&s;tne&s;s in his manners, he had a certain coldne&s;s and indifference in his nature, which rendered him in&s;en&s;ible to fond or friendly attachments; chance, caprice, or convenience, forming and di&s;&s;olving all his con|nections.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we were parting, continued Mr. Andrews, he to go take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, and I to return to London, our fair friend gave me &s;ome &s;light commi&s;&s;ions to exe|cute for her, among which I received a letter to deliver to her brother, who was then in town, and in whom I had before met with all that I had ever wi&s;hed in man: A &s;obriety of manners, a refinement of moral, a liberal mind, a &s;pirited heart, and an univer&s;al benevolence of affections. Be&s;ides which, a perfect agreement in all our general notions, of philo&s;ophy, poli|tics, or religion, united and &s;tampt us friends for life. The approbation and e&s;teem which I had marked toward his &s;i&s;ter, rendered our union &s;till more tender. I loved him yet more, becau&s;e he was her brother, and he became
<PB N="40" REF="67">
fonder of me for the polite regards I had always paid to her.</P>
<P>When I had executed Mi&s;s Beville's commi&s;|&s;ions, I took the liberty of giving her an ac|count of them, by letter. I wrote to her with gaiety and galantry, but kept quite clear of the lea&s;t hint or expre&s;&s;ion tending toward pa&s;&s;ion. In the fir&s;t place, my affections had not arrived to &s;uch an height as might have excu&s;ed a free|dom of that kind; and next, my fortunes de|pended too much upon the caprice of another per&s;on, to &s;uffer me ha&s;tily to form attachments on my own &s;entiments.</P>
<P>In this letter, however, I endeavoured to court her into a corre&s;pondence, merely to ex|change the news of town and country, with each other. But this &s;he declined. She an|&s;wered my civilities in a letter to her brother, and paid &s;ome compliments to my character, and manner of writing; adding, that &s;he would be both plea&s;ed and flattered with a continuance of my epi&s;tles; but that, as there ought never to be any kind of my&s;tery between us to which Mr. Beville need be a &s;tranger, &s;he hoped that I would always accept of her acknowledgments, in paragraphs of her letters to him.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed at her delicacy upon this point, and continued the corre&s;pondence, on her own
<PB N="41" REF="68">
terms, while Mr. Beville remained in London; and, when he returned to Wind&s;or, &s;he was prevailed upon &s;o far, at his in&s;tance, as &s;ome|times to write paragraphs to me her&s;elf, in his letters.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>WE both of us found this amu&s;ement ex|tremely plea&s;ant, for a time, and ex|erted, upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, the highe&s;t &s;pirit and addre&s;s we were capable of, on each &s;ide, but without any other view than what we might have had on playing in concert together, to pre|&s;erve time and harmony, and mutually exchange compliments upon each other's performance.</P>
<P>But I would never advi&s;e any per&s;on to enter into &s;uch an intercour&s;e with the other &s;ex, be|fore &s;ome farther con&s;equences &s;hall have been fully weighed and con&s;idered of. The having one object con&s;tantly in contemplation, is even more dangerous, than the having it always in view. We are not apt to keep &s;uch a &s;trict guard over our reflections, as we do upon our actions; and, when the mind once &s;urrenders it&s;elf up to the fond per&s;ua&s;ion of a &s;eparate
<PB N="42" REF="69">
plea&s;ure, the heart &s;oon begins to grow jealous; and if it &s;hould happen to be a fit object for its occupation, &s;teals &s;lily in for its &s;hare.</P>
<P>I made frequent excur&s;ions to Wind&s;or, and perceived that each time I returned from it with more and more regret. My pa&s;&s;ion commenced unknown to me, and increa&s;ed by &s;uch in&s;en&s;ible degrees, that its empire was e&s;tabli&s;hed in my brea&s;t, before I even &s;u&s;pected its inva&s;ion. Nay, &s;uch is our blindne&s;s, or our vanity, that I actually be|gan to perceive her regards ari&s;e, before I di&s;|covered my own. And when her marked pre|ferences, her <HI>petits &s;oins,</HI> her manners free to others con&s;trained towards me, had fir&s;t alarmed my honour, I forthwith determined to withdraw my&s;elf from an intercour&s;e which might perhaps end fatally to one or other of us, po&s;&s;ibly to both.</P>
<P>I formed this re&s;olution on the in&s;tant, one morning at Wind&s;or, and returned to London with that precipitation with which one is apt to execute an irk&s;ome purpo&s;e; hurrying away, to have it over; and it was on this retreat, and not before, that I fir&s;t perceived my affections to have been a long time <HI>prae-engaged.</HI> However, frequent reflections upon the expediency of the mea&s;ure I had re&s;olved upon, helped to &s;upport me through the difficulty of it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="70">I con&s;idered that I had no fortune independent, nor any profe&s;&s;ion to render my&s;elf &s;o; and that all my pro&s;pects in life were founded on the will of a &s;evere father, who having made his own e&s;tabli&s;hment by a lucky marriage, might be the more apt to re&s;ent an indi&s;cretion, with regard to this particular, than in any thing el&s;e. E&s;pecially, as he was wont frequently, in &s;ome of his elevated moods, to vaunt him&s;elf highly, upon his own &s;ucce&s;s; and hint often before me, that a man of &s;pirit and addre&s;s might meet with many opportunities of pu&s;hing his fortune more ea&s;ily and expeditiou&s;ly by marriage, than by the &s;low means, and dull labour of any trade, art or profe&s;&s;ion what&s;oever. I therefore oppo&s;ed pru|dence to pa&s;&s;ion, and ballanced duty again&s;t ro|mance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I arrived in London, I told my father that I was weary of &s;pending an idle di&s;&s;ipated kind of life, and begged he would purcha&s;e &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion for me in the army. He replied, that &s;ince he found I was inclined to
<PB N="44" REF="71">
that profe&s;&s;ion, he was in hopes, as fre&s;h troops were then levying every day, of being able to obtain me one by the intere&s;t of his friends, without the expence of buying.</P>
<P>I appeared &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, at the time, not &s;o much from any &s;anguine expecta|tions I had conceived, either from the good-will, or exertion of any of his friends, but it afforded me an occa&s;ion, which I thought it became me to lay hold of, for taking leave in form, of the too dear mi&s;s Beville, whom I thought it ex|tremely ungalant to withdraw my&s;elf from &s;o abruptly and intirely, without any apparent rea|&s;on, or nece&s;&s;ity. Accordingly, I wrote her a letter, conceived in cool, but civil terms, ac|quainting her with my pre&s;ent de&s;tination; re|pre&s;enting it in a more forward &s;ituation than it was likely &s;oon to be, by &s;aying, that I expected, every day, to be commanded over to Germany; and &s;o concluded my letter with taking leave, <HI>perhaps for life,</HI> which was my expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About this time, a friend of mine, who had been my &s;choolfellow, came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large fortune, by the death of his father, and had al&s;o a con&s;iderable intere&s;t in a certain county, which gave him a weight with &s;ome per&s;ons in the mini&s;try. I &s;oon after paid my compliments to him, upon his acce&s;&s;ions, and
<PB N="45" REF="72">
was received with great politene&s;s and friend|&s;hip by him. He a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions with regard to my&s;elf, and I let him into my pre&s;ent &s;cheme of life, without or hope or de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In a few days after, I received a letter from this gentleman, acquainting me that he had ob|tained a cornetry for me, from his friend the mini&s;ter, wi&s;hing me &s;ucce&s;s, and a&s;&s;uring me of every future &s;ervice in his power. I was much elated, at fir&s;t, and &s;till continued to be &s;o, but from a more generous motive. I con&s;idered that I had two younger brothers, who, having never received any manner of education, were but in an hazardous &s;ituation in life. Their helple&s;s and unprovided &s;tate lay heavy on my mind, as well as my own, and apprehending that I might have better advantages than they, to pu&s;h my fortune, I determined to cede the commi&s;&s;ion to the elde&s;t of them, I waited on my patron accordingly, the next day, expre&s;&s;ed my gratitude, and urged my &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject. He appeared much &s;urpri&s;ed, at fir&s;t, but afterwards he applauded my motives, and had my brother immediately nominated in my &s;tead.</P>
<P>About half a year after this event, my good friend called upon me one morning, and told me that he had been ju&s;t appointed to a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="46" REF="73">
patent-employ, in which he had the power of naming a deputy, with a &s;alary of one hundred pounds a year, and had been &s;o &s;truck with the <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> as he was plea&s;ed to term it, of my former motion, that he was re&s;olved to ea&s;e my mind of the &s;econd incumbrance al&s;o; which was accordingly done.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend, Mr. Beville, continued Mr. An|drews, had taken a farm in Hertford&s;hire, &s;oon after I had quitted Wind&s;or; and was &s;o wholly occupied about it, that all intercour&s;e of letters, as well as vi&s;its, had dropt between him and me, for about eight months. During which time I had not the lea&s;t opportunity of hearing any manner of account about his dear, &s;till dearer &s;i&s;ter, which afforded me full exerci&s;e for my u&s;ual re&s;orts in every difficulty, or unea&s;ine&s;s of the mind&mdash;books and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>After this interval, I happened, one morning, accidentally to meet a neighbour of Mr. Be|ville's, in London, whom I had often &s;een at his hou&s;e in Wind&s;or, and a&s;king him, in a &s;eeming carele&s;s way, about that Family, I was
<PB N="47" REF="74">
told that mi&s;s Beville's manners and behaviour had been remarkably alter'd of late, that from gay and chearful, &s;he had grown grave and re|tired; that &s;he never &s;tirred abroad, except to church, where &s;he attended indeed, rather more &s;tictly than u&s;ual, and &s;pent her time mo&s;tly in reading, &s;hut up in her chamber; which ac|count he concluded, in a laughing way, by tel|ling me a reflection about her, that was made by the curate, <HI>that either love, or learning, he was afraid, had turned poor mi&s;s's head.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e particulars rendered me extremely un|ea&s;y, I began to apprehend that what I had ima|gined in her to have been only the &s;light tokens of a commencing pa&s;&s;ion, might have been ra|ther the certain proofs of a confirmed one. May not my charming Fanny, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, have been unwarily led into the &s;ame error in this particular, that I had fallen into my&s;elf? might &s;he not have perceived my pa&s;&s;ion, before &s;he had &s;u&s;pected her own; and thus have enno|bled her affections, by the generous principles of gratitude and compa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>I then began to blame the indi&s;cretion of my own dalliance, lamenting the effects of it in her brea&s;t, as well as in mine. My philo&s;ophy had bravely with&s;tood my own pa&s;&s;ion, but was overborne by hers. All con&s;iderations of fa|ther, fortune, or expediency, dwindled into
<PB N="48" REF="75">
mere words, upon this ju&s;t &s;entiment, that though prudence &s;hould re&s;train our affections, it ought never to controul our honour. After the&s;e re|flections, I repaired immediately to Wind&s;or, in order to &s;atisfy my &s;cruples, upon this truly intere&s;ting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was at this interval, continued he, while I was &s;truggling both with my heart and fortune, that I had the happine&s;s of becoming acquainted with you, my dear Carewe. I tried, approved, and admired you. There was &s;omething be&s;ides, in your whole air and manner, which re&s;embled the per&s;on of my favourite condi&s;ciple, but with a nobler moral, and a more liberal &s;oul. Mr. Ca|rewe bowed, and blu&s;hed at this encomium, and was ju&s;t going to return the compliment, when Mr. Beville happened to come into the room, and gave a new turn to the conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>ONE evening, as Mr. Andrews was return|ing home to his father's hou&s;e, in London, he ob&s;erved, at &s;ome di&s;tance, as he was pa&s;&s;ing through Ludgate-hill, a gentleman defending him&s;elf with his &s;word, again&s;t four mean, ill-looking fellows, who drove furiou&s;ly at him with &s;taves and cudgels.

He &s;u&s;tained &s;everal &s;trokes, and returned &s;ome pa&s;&s;es at the a&s;&s;ailants, till they fled, upon &s;eeing an indignant crowd come ru&s;h|ing

<P>As &s;oon as they had got into the parlour, Mr. Carewe embraced his gallant <HI>&s;econd,</HI> and thanked him for the generous aid he had af|forded him; adding, that he had even more than life to thank him for, as his <HI>liberty,</HI> which he prized dearer, had been then at &s;take, in the hands of tho&s;e ruffian bailiffs, who were attempting to arre&s;t him upon a debt of five hundred pounds; which alone, indeed, continued he, would not have long confined me; but the con&s;equences of it, in bringing &s;ome other demands, more pre&s;|&s;ingly upon me at the &s;ame time, might perhaps have rendered me <HI>tenant for life</HI> to the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ia.</HI> But, added he, as &s;oon as it is dark, I &s;hall quit this a&s;ylum and London together, this night, and retire into the country, till &s;ome better oeco|nomy, or other lucky incident of fortune, may hereafter place my pre&s;ent involved affairs in a proper &s;tate of defence.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews called for a bottle of wine, which they drank chearfully together, without any interruption. Mr. Carewe then de&s;ired a chair to be &s;ent for, which was directed round to a back door, leading into an unfrequented lane,

<P>MR. Andrews was a good deal plea&s;ed with this adventure, at fir&s;t, both on account of the &s;ervice he had rendered, even to a &s;tranger in di&s;tre&s;s; and that there was &s;omething in this gentleman's per&s;on, manners, and appearance, which had attracted his &s;impathy, at fir&s;t fight, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with a de&s;ire of being fur|ther acquainted with him.</P>
<P>He was a young man, of about twenty-three years of age, tall, genteel, and well propor|tioned; his features were remarkably hand&s;ome, and he had a &s;en&s;ible countenance, quickened with &s;pirit and vivacity. He was richly dre&s;&s;ed, and had, altogether, the air, addre&s;s, and mien of a per&s;on of quality, and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>In his conver&s;ation he &s;hewed a lively wit, a readine&s;s of conception, and a quickne&s;s of re|ply;
<PB N="52" REF="79">
in his expre&s;&s;ion, there appeared the ea&s;e, &s;tile, and correctne&s;s of a liberal education; and on the few topics which the &s;hort interval of their <HI>t&ecirc;te &aacute; t&ecirc;te</HI> had afforded them the occa&s;ion of introducing, his judgment and &s;entiments denoted a competent knowledge of men, man|ners, and things.</P>
<P>But, after he had lei&s;ure for <HI>his own reflections,</HI> his nice moral began &s;oon to render him unea&s;y, at having wre&s;ted a per&s;on out of the hands of the law, and defrauding, perhaps, a fair credi|tor, of a ju&s;t demand. He deliberated upon this &s;cruple for &s;ome time, and then determined it within him&s;elf, that this debt had, in ju&s;tice, now become his own, as truly as if he had ori|ginally contracted it; and upon this punctilio re&s;olved, without the lea&s;t regard to con&s;equences, to tender him&s;elf as collateral &s;ecurity, to the creditor, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be able to inform him&s;elf of the per&s;on.</P>
<P>Accordingly next morning he repaired to one of the &s;heriffs of the city, with whom he hap|pened to be intimately acquainted, and inquired from him who the plaintiff was, in the writ lately i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Mr. Carewe. The &s;heriff carried him to the office, and, upon examining the books, found him to be an eminent banker in the city.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="80">Upon this information Mr. Andrews imme|diately waited upon the banker, at his hou&s;e, told him who he was, acquainted him with the adventure of the evening before, declared his &s;cruples upon it, and, at the &s;ame time, offered to pa&s;s a counter-&s;ecurity to him, to make that debt his own, if Mr. Carewe &s;hould not di&s;charge it within a year. Old <HI>Cent. per cent.</HI> &s;tared at him, for &s;ome time, with a&s;toni&s;hment; the thing perhaps might have been a <HI>new ca&s;e,</HI> and might po&s;&s;ibly not have fallen within the ordinary cour&s;e of his dealings. But throwing off the &s;ur|pri&s;e, as quick as he could, he replied, Why, really, Sir, you act but the fair and hone&s;t part, it is ju&s;t what I &s;hould have done my&s;elf, or indeed what any body el&s;e would do, in like circum|&s;tances. No, no, Sir, there is no trifling with money matters; a very &s;erious thing are your money matters, Mr. Andrews. Therefore, Sir, pray, good Sir, walk into my office till I write a note to my attorney, who mu&s;t certainly be well acquainted with precedents of this &s;ort, and he will forthwith attend and draw up the proper ar|ticle between us, Sir.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<P>THE attorney appeared &s;oon after, and, taking his place at a table oppo&s;ite to Mr. Andrews, addre&s;&s;ed him thus: <Q>Your Chri&s;tian-name, pray good Sir?</Q> <HI>Henry&mdash; but pray don't you require my Sir-name al&s;o?</HI> <Q>O! that I &s;uppo&s;e is Carewe&mdash;Are you not a bro|ther of Mr. Carewe's, Sir?</Q> <HI>No, Sir, I am not, nor any manner of relation to him at all, that I know of.</HI> <Q>The money though, I pre&s;ume, mu&s;t have been for your u&s;e?</Q> <HI>Not one penny of it, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, nor did I ever &s;ee Mr. Ca|rewe before, or know any thing, in the lea&s;t, about this matter, till after the incident which happened ye&s;terday evening on Ludgate-hill.</HI></P>
<P>Here the attorney laid down his pen, and was beginning to elevate his eyebrows, when the banker, growing alarmed at this conver&s;ation, winked at him, and begged he would proceed with the in&s;trument, without any further lo&s;s of time, which, after a&s;king Mr. Andrews his Sir|name, he drew up immediately, and it was per|fected accordingly.</P>
<P>After the tremendous &s;ound of <HI>&s;ign, &s;eal, and deliver,</HI> was pronounced, Mr. Andrews ro&s;e up,
<PB N="55" REF="82">
made his bow, and retired, the banker and at|torney attending him to the door; where, on a <HI>hem</HI> from the latter, he was laid hold of by four ruffians in arms, arre&s;ting him for the <HI>riot,</HI> as they termed it, on the night before, in which they &s;aid that one of the bailiffs, <HI>as worthy a citizen as ever broke the world's bread,</HI> had been wounded by his <HI>compli&s;h,</HI> one Carewe, <HI>a mere &s;tape-grace of a fellow,</HI> and that his life was de|&s;paired of.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews, according to that philo&s;ophic complexion which added a lu&s;tre and a dignity to all his actions, &s;ubmitted him&s;elf without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, or even a murmur, to the ar|re&s;t, only ju&s;t turning his eyes, for a moment, on the attorney, to &s;ee whether he &s;till retained an human form, and directing a chair to be cal|led, in order to be conducted un&s;een to pri&s;on. In the interim, <HI>the man of money</HI> expo&s;tulated thus, with <HI>the man of law,</HI> that &s;uch a proceeding might po&s;&s;ibly be very injurious to him; for, if the gentleman &s;hould happen to be hanged, &s;aid he, which very probably may be the ca&s;e, mu&s;t I not certainly lo&s;e part of my &s;ecurity, for the five hundred pounds? and this, if you'll but weigh it well, Sir, you mu&s;t allow to be a very unlucky circum&s;tance for me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="83">I cannot help that matter, replied the attorney, for the&s;e hone&s;t gentlemen the bailiffs, are my clients, as well as you are, Sir; nay, the king him&s;elf, who is higher than ye all put together, is my client al&s;o, in this &s;uit, as plaintiff again&s;t the pri&s;oner, and <HI>currat lex</HI> is the rule of my life, Sir, as you may &s;ee it is the motto of my coach too, &s;aid he, pointing to an equipage which &s;tood at the door; and &s;tepping into it at the &s;ame time, drove away, after having concluded his moral with this expre&s;&s;ion, That, according to his way of thinking, a man who was fool enough to go bound for another's debt, de&s;erved to be hanged for another's crime. The chair arrived, Mr. Andrews went into it, attended by the bailiffs, and the banker returned into his hou&s;e again.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as Mr. Andrews had been lodged in confinement, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to his friend the Sheriff, to <HI>come unto him,</HI> which he immediately obeyed. He acquainted him with the unhappy con&s;equences of his romantic ho|nour, and inquired in what condition of dan|ger
<PB N="57" REF="84">
the wounded bailiff was, at that time. He replied, that the Surgeon had ju&s;t then made a report at his office, on that morning's dre&s;&s;ing, that the wound, though dangerous, was not mortal; and therefore, added he, you may yet be admitted to bail, which I would advi&s;e you to procure immediately, before this hazardous affair may take a more unlucky turn, or afford the &s;urgeon cau&s;e to pronounce le&s;s favourably, about his patient.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews then di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the banker, to inquire who Mr. Carewe was, where he had lodged in London, and what town or county of England, an expre&s;s might have the be&s;t chance of finding him in? To which he was an&s;wered, that all he knew of that gentleman, was his having become bound for the five hundred pounds then in &s;uit, along with a certain merchant, who had &s;ince become bankrupt; and ab&s;conded; and that he was a lodger at the widow Ben&s;on's, a milliner, in Duke&s;treet, Gro&s;venor's Square, at the time of his arre&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews, upon this information, &s;ent off an intelligent per&s;on to this lodging, to make a particular inquiry about him, but received as little &s;atisfaction from that quarter, al&s;o. The landlady &s;aid, that Squire Carewe had lodged
<PB N="58" REF="85">
<HI>under her roof,</HI> for about the la&s;t &s;ix months, <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> and had di&s;charged her the <HI>very</HI> night before, <HI>on the &s;udden,</HI> without the lea&s;t manner of <HI>previous</HI> warning, <HI>before hand,</HI> except only the &s;ending a per&s;on to her with the rent, who whi&s;pered Mr. Carewe's &s;ervant where to follow his ma&s;ter, with his trunks; which makes me <HI>timorous,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, that all is not right with the poor gentleman. Adding, that &s;he knew not where his fortune lay, of what family he was, or what connections he had, either in city or country, having never &s;een any per&s;on come <HI>anear</HI> him, from whom &s;he could have picked up any &s;ort of intelligence, of this kind.</P>
<P>She concluded her account of him, with &s;aying, that to be &s;ure and certain he was a dear gay &s;oul of a lad, but a little <HI>rake-helli&s;h,</HI> or &s;o, &s;he believed, like the <HI>be&s;t of them;</HI> for that he &s;ometimes kept late hours, and would at other times &s;tay abroad whole nights together, <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ively,</HI> one after ano|ther. But that, without all manner of <HI>gain&s;ay,</HI> or <HI>peradventure,</HI> &s;he never beheld <HI>with her eyes,</HI> a more <HI>good-humourder affability</HI> gentleman; for that he would frequently joke and romp with her daughter Cicely, ju&s;t <HI>for all the world like one of our&s;elves;</HI> and &s;ometimes in good truth, that a body <HI>would</HI> &s;carce <HI>hear their own ears,</HI> for their noi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="86">But indeed, added &s;he, the good <HI>nature&s;ome</HI> cretur left off his <HI>gamiorum</HI> a little, for the la&s;t three or four weeks <HI>before he went away,</HI> being <HI>timber&s;ome</HI> of hurting the poor girl, who has been for &s;ome time apprehended to be falling into a drop&s;y, and the <HI>poticary</HI> tells me lately, conti|nued &s;he, in a whining tone, that he is much afraid my dear child has got an <HI>impo&s;tor,</HI> in her belly. But to be &s;ure it was the Lord's will that it &s;hould come there, and who can help &s;ickne&s;s, I &s;ay?</P>
<P>After this &s;crap of religion and philo&s;ophy, &s;he recovered her voice again, and putting a bundle of papers into the per&s;on's hands, &s;aid, Here Sir, I give you &s;ome <HI>male&s;cripts</HI> that I found &s;cattered about Mr. Carewe's clo&s;et this morning, which I &s;uppo&s;e are no <HI>&s;ignifies,</HI> by their being left be|hind. But perhaps you, Sir, continued &s;he, may be able to find out &s;ome hints or <HI>antidotes</HI> among them, which may &s;erve to direct your &s;earch after Mr. Carewe; and, dear Sir, added &s;he, if ever you &s;hould happen to get the lea&s;t tidings of my worthy gue&s;t, I prithee acquaint me with it; for poor Cicely there within, is breaking her heart after him, ju&s;t like a child that had lo&s;t its play-thing, becau&s;e of his <HI>good-humouredne&s;s</HI> and <HI>comicality.</HI> And in truth, Sir, concluded &s;he, even my&s;elf thinks the hou&s;e it|&s;elf

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Andrews had got the&s;e pa|pers into his hands, he looked eagerly through them, to &s;ee if he could receive any manner of information about his dear bought friend, but was di&s;appointed. They were only a collection of reflexions and ob&s;ervations, upon <HI>life, plea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> as they were intitled on the back, thrown together after the manner of Pa&s;chal's thoughts, without order or dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>However, the admirable turn of moral which appeared throughout the&s;e notes, afforded poor Mr. Andrews &s;ome hope in Mr. Carewe's ho|nour, that he would redeem him, as far as the laws might admit, from the twofold difficulties he had been involved in upon his account. But then, how to come at him, or acquaint him of them?</P>
<P>But it at la&s;t occurred, that though he did not know where to convey a private notice to him, a public hint might reach him, in any part of
<PB N="61" REF="88">
the kingdom. Upon which thought he imme|diately directed a paragraph to be in&s;erted in all the news-papers, &s;etting forth, <Q>that a per&s;on, who had accidentally re&s;cued a gentleman from an a&s;&s;ault on Ludgate-hill, on &s;uch an evening, had been, the next day, involved in a &s;evere misfortune, upon that account; and that if his unknown friend &s;hould be inclined to afford any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, toward re|lieving him out of his pre&s;ent difficulties, he might &s;end a line to Mr. H. A. at the <HI>Wood|&s;treet Compter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He then &s;at him&s;elf down to recollect all tho&s;e per&s;ons in London, who had ever received obli|gations from him&s;elf, or his family, or who had ever declared particular friend&s;hips for him, through life; and, after he had formed a li&s;t of about three or four and twenty names within &s;uch connections, he di&s;patched a letter to the fir&s;t upon his paper, &s;etting forth his &s;ituation; not in the lea&s;t doubting his ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as he was a young gentleman of con&s;iderable for|tune, to whom Mr. Andrews's father had been guardian, and acquitted him&s;elf of the tru&s;t, to the perfect &s;atisfaction of all his friends, with regard both to his health, education, and e&s;tate; and with whom he had him&s;elf lived in a fond
<PB N="62" REF="89">
and free manner, even from their earlie&s;t years to that time.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer he received to this letter, was, that as a per&s;on of his fortune in life, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily have <HI>a large number of friends,</HI> he thought it would be an imprudent &s;tep in him to afford a precedent for &s;o many others to call upon his <HI>good-nature,</HI> in like circum&s;tances; he therefore begged to be excu&s;ed. He acknowledged indeed &s;ome few obligations to his father, but con|cluded, at the &s;ame time, with &s;aying, Prithee what, after all, has he done for me, more than the law would have exacted from him?</P>
<P>If the &s;ins of the father's be vi&s;ited upon the children, why not their merits al&s;o? But it &s;eems that, do all we can, we &s;hall be deemed &s;till but <HI>unprofitable</HI> &s;ervants, here, as well as here|after. This, too truly, is no uncommon rea&s;on|ing, among men; and <HI>nothing for nothing,</HI> is this world's motto.</P>

<P>THIS di&s;appointment &s;hocked poor Mr. An|drews, but did not di&s;courage him. He &s;at down again, and wrote a letter directly, to the &s;econd upon his li&s;t; who was a gentleman every way qualified to &s;erve him, at this cri&s;is, both from affluence, credit, and intere&s;t in the city. He had the&s;e rea&s;ons to expect it too, that they had been &s;choolfellows together, that an intimate friend&s;hip had ever &s;ince &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween them, and that he had lately, at the ha|zard of his life, rendered him a mo&s;t &s;ignal piece of &s;ervice. The &s;tory was this:</P>
<P>They had &s;upped together, at a tavern, one night, with &s;everal other per&s;ons, when an ab|&s;urd, ill-tempered fellow in company, took it into his head to <HI>fa&s;ten</HI> (I think that is the phra&s;e) upon this gentleman, without any manner of provocation, but &s;olely to indulge his own &s;pleen; and, finding him to be too &s;low of re|&s;entment, proceeded to <HI>bear him down,</HI> in the mo&s;t bullying manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews felt compa&s;&s;ion for his friend, and taking advantage of his looking toward him, though with a mo&s;t timorous countenance, ro&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="91">
up, &s;aying, <Q>Yes, Sir, I under&s;tand you, but I can by no means &s;uffer this matter to become per&s;onal. That gentleman's behaviour is an equal in&s;ult to the whole company, and, as all tavern reckonings are paid <HI>by club,</HI> I expect that every man here will join me in obliging this di&s;turber of the peace to a&s;k pardon of the whole room, or in treating him as a per|&s;on who&s;e manners have placed him below the character of a gentleman.</Q></P>
<P>Reader, don't you think that this would be the proper method of dealing with your <HI>bucks,</HI> or <HI>bears;</HI> to make a general ri&s;ing again&s;t them, at once? For, &s;urely, it is an hard ca&s;e that one man mu&s;t venture his life, merely becau&s;e ano|ther does not value his.</P>
<P>The whole company, one and all, &s;ome through &s;pirit, and others through &s;hame, ro&s;e up in arms, at the word, poor <HI>&s;neaker</HI> now as forward as the be&s;t; and in&s;i&s;ted on his making a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or leaping out of the win|dow. The ea&s;ier conditions were accepted of, and all was peace and harmony for the re&s;t of the night.</P>
<P>It is now full time to acquaint you with the an&s;wer which Mr. Andrews received to his &s;e|cond emba&s;&s;y, which in few words was this: <Q>That he would be extremely glad to oblige
<PB N="65" REF="92">
his dear friend, in any other way he could re|quire, but that he had made it an invariable rule to him&s;elf, upon his fir&s;t entrance into life, never to become a bond&s;man for any per&s;on what&s;oever.</Q>&mdash;Concluding his letter with this pa&s;&s;age out of Proverbs, <HI>He that hateth &s;urety, &s;hall be &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Cowardice betrays a narrowne&s;s of &s;oul; and a man can no more be generous, than brave, under &s;uch mean circum&s;tances of heart and mind.</P>

<P>I Have now, &s;aid Mr. Andrews to him&s;elf, had repeated ill luck, by proceeding in a regular cour&s;e, and taking <HI>my friends</HI> one after another, as I had noted them down in the roll. Perhaps I may meet with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, by &s;elect|ing them here and there, according to the rank they hold in my opinion of their virtue, or the degree which I think my&s;elf intitled to, in their regards.</P>
<P>Upon this reflection he moved his eye &s;lowly and con&s;iderately, over the li&s;t, and at la&s;t fixed upon a per&s;on who&s;e character, life and fortune,
<PB N="66" REF="93">
had at once been attacked, by popular &s;lander, &s;uits at law, and criminal pro&s;ecution. Mr. An|drews, unknowing him, and without any other connection, except the ties of humanity and benevolence, but per&s;uaded of the malice and inju&s;tice, at that time raging again&s;t him, had generou&s;ly became a volunteer in his cau&s;e; re|trieved his character by public writings, and de|fended his life and fortunes, from the virulence and oppre&s;&s;ion of his enemies.</P>
<P>He di&s;patched a billet to this <HI>oblig&eacute;e,</HI> and waited, in perfect acquie&s;cence of his ju&s;tice, honour, and gratitude, till the me&s;&s;enger&mdash;&s;ay rather the friend him&s;elf, returns. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to convey an adequate idea of this corre&s;pondent's re&s;pon&s;e, to the reader, without giving him a literal tran&s;cript of the letter, which was <HI>verbatim,</HI> as follows:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Andrews,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW cruel is it in you to put my <HI>a&s;&s;ured friend&s;hip</HI> for you, to &s;o &s;evere a &s;hock! How irk&s;ome to the <HI>generous mind,</HI> to be a&s;ked what it mu&s;t deny. A <HI>burnt child,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>dreads the fire;</HI> and my own danger is &s;till too recent in my mind, to &s;uffer me to run the ha|zard of incurring &s;o &s;oon again, the public cen|&s;ure, and the re&s;entment of the <HI>courts,</HI> by thus
<PB N="67" REF="94">
openly abetting a per&s;on who has had the <HI>misfor|tune</HI> (for my <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> will not &s;uffer me to call it by an har&s;her title) of violating the laws of his country, in two &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances, as a re&s;cue and a murder.</P>
<P>This would be to involve my&s;elf in your <HI>im|puted guilt;</HI> and, by looking too like a mutual compact to &s;upport each other in iniquity, be apt to endanger anew, that injured character, which you have already &s;o generou&s;ly, and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully defended.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you, however, both &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s, and am, as in duty bound, my deare&s;t Andrews, your <HI>truly &s;incere friend, and mo&s;t obliged humble &s;ervant.</HI></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Gracious heaven! that a per&s;on &s;hould at|tempt to forge arguments for his ingratitude, out of tho&s;e very incidents of his life, from whence aro&s;e a claim to the highe&s;t demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip! Should it not rather have excited a tran&s;port, <HI>almo&s;t bordering upon vice,</HI> of rejoicing at &s;o lucky an occa&s;ion of acquitting one&s;elf of &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing obligations! Ingratitude is a de|te&s;table thing; for, be&s;ides the vice, there is a meanne&s;s in it al&s;o, which di&s;gu&s;ts.</P>
<P>There is certainly a mo&s;t <HI>helli&s;h</HI> turn of wit, in the above letter, and I could wi&s;h, with all
<PB N="68" REF="95">
my heart, that the &s;tory was not quite &s;o abo|minable, le&s;t the indignant reader may &s;u&s;pect its veracity.

<P>WELL! what's to be done now? Mr. Andrews was a good deal ca&s;t down, upon this third, and lea&s;t expected di&s;appoint|ment; and now, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved to make no farther e&s;&s;ays, of this hopele&s;s kind. I have already, &s;aid he, made experiments upon three of the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>anchors</HI> I had, and they have failed me. To pur&s;ue the trial longer, would be to betray le&s;s rea&s;on than a dog,
<PB N="69" REF="96">
which, foiled in one or two attempts to get at food, will ne'er again a&s;&s;ail the latticed grate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophers urge this article, among the in&s;tances of that animal's rationality; whereas, &s;ay they, were he guided by appetite or in&s;tinct, merely, he would &s;till con|tinue the attempt, till his &s;trength failed him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, as he had always a way, in any matter of con&s;equence, of trying every method, probable or improbable, po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible, to compa&s;s an end, (not, indeed, acting from his own judgment, but in order to &s;atisfy the <HI>officious</HI> queries of <HI>una&s;&s;i&s;ting</HI> friends, <Q>Why did you not do &s;o and &s;o? or this, or that, or t'other?)</Q> he &s;ent a per&s;on round to the re|mainder of his li&s;t, inviting them all together, to come and &s;pend the evening with him; but without giving the lea&s;t hint of the reque&s;t he had a de&s;ign of making to them; imagining that, though one or two might think the obliga|tion too great, a <HI>&s;core of friends</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly join to divide the load among them.</P>
<P>His me&s;&s;enger had the good fortune of meet|ing every one of the gue&s;ts, at home, and having acquainted them that their friend Mr. Andrews had de&s;ired their company re&s;pectively, to con|&s;ult together upon a certain difficult matter, which he would communicate to them at meet|ing, they each of them mo&s;t readily accepted of
<PB N="70" REF="97">
the invitation. What, hone&s;t Andrews, cried one, no bu&s;ine&s;s on earth &s;hall detain me from him. I would run an hundred miles, on foot, to &s;erve him, &s;ays another. He de&s;erves every act of friend&s;hip in the world, from me, cried a third. And &s;o went on the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But when the &s;u&s;picious &s;cene of appointment came to be named, their bri&s;k countenances were overca&s;t, on the &s;udden. They made &s;ome kind of inquiries, how it was, and how it happened; and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the me&s;&s;enger with their condolements and be&s;t wi&s;hes to their worthy friend Mr. Andrews, who might re&s;t a&s;|&s;ured that nothing, <HI>except &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s or other, of con&s;equence, might chance to intervene,</HI> &s;hould prevent them the plea&s;ure of waiting upon him, in the evening.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer began to revive his drooping &s;pi|rits, and he &s;aid, in &s;oliloquy, that one &s;hould always make u&s;e of every kind of means, in dif|ficult ca&s;es; as it &s;ometimes happens, that the mo&s;t unlikely ones &s;ucceed, where the be&s;t con|certed may &s;ail. He walked about his chamber for an hour or two, in longing expectation of &s;eeing <HI>a groupe of friends</HI> ru&s;hing together into the room; and his hone&s;t heart &s;prang with joy, at hearing the &s;ound of a number of ha&s;ty &s;teps come ecchoing up the &s;tairs. He threw open
<PB N="71" REF="98">
wide the door, and his arms, at the &s;ame time, but received into them only a parcel of &s;weaty porters, with each a billet in his hand.</P>
<P>You have read the &s;tory of the <HI>invited</HI> gue&s;ts, in &s;cripture&mdash;if not, I beg you will immediately turn over to it. My wife &s;ays 'tis in Luke, the fourteenth chapter, and eighteenth ver&s;e, fir&s;t paragraph. For this will &s;ave me the trouble of repeating a &s;core of apologies to the unfortunate Mr. Andrews, from &s;o many <HI>modern friends.</HI></P>

<P>A Per&s;on thus forlorn of all foreign aids, generally betakes him&s;elf to philo&s;ophic re&s;ources; that is, with deference to the <HI>porch,</HI> to melancholic reflections. For, what are all the arguments of Seneca or Epictetus, (though in truth this la&s;t advi&s;es &s;ometimes, to hang one|&s;elf, <HI>The door is open,</HI> &s;ays he) that fate is inevi|table; that what will be, will be; that we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, where we cannot defend; that the be&s;t have &s;uffered; and that life it&s;elf, is but an ap|pointed &s;tate of trial&mdash;and &s;o forth&mdash;What is all this, I &s;ay, but holding our misfortunes the
<PB N="72" REF="99">
more &s;tedfa&s;tly under contemplation, and &s;uper|adding a further weight from de&s;pair? Would a phy&s;ician mean to rai&s;e your drooping &s;pirits, by pronouncing you pa&s;t hopes?</P>
<P>I heard once of a French &s;urgeon, who mo&s;t happily expre&s;&s;ed the whole &s;pirit of &s;toici&s;m, in one word; for, upon probing a wound, and being a&s;ked by the patient, his opinion of his ca&s;e, replied, <HI>Courage, courage, Mon&s;ieur&mdash;for begar you die in one half hour.</HI> This I take truly, to be but an epitome of <Q>inevitable fate, what will be, will be; where we cannot defend, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Courage, cries old <HI>For|ceps,</HI> for begar you die in one half hour.</P>
<P>But Mr. Andrews had a much better manner of conducting him&s;elf, upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions: for whenever he felt, or even apprehended any kind of difficulty, he immediately &s;at him&s;elf down to ruminate on every means, which pru|dence or activity could &s;upply, to obviate or remedy the evil: But from the moment that he had dige&s;ted and applied his expedients, he directly applied him&s;elf al&s;o to reading, with &s;uch an attention of mind and &s;tudy, that he could, for the time, exclude all thought or reflection, either upon the misfortune or the means, till the cri&s;is or the cure, had awakened his recollection again.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="100">And this method of <HI>avocation,</HI> I take to be a much better way, than to &s;it brooding over mi&s;|fortunes, or the hardine&s;s of attacking them, <HI>to take arms again&s;t a &s;iege of troubles,</HI> with the wea|pons of philo&s;ophy. For what is generally ima|gined to be a <HI>&s;trength of mind,</HI> is often little more than <HI>a command of features,</HI> which enables us to put a good face upon bad matters, and only &s;uffers misfortune, like the mo&s;t dangerous wound, <HI>inwardly to bleed.</HI> Zeno, founder of the &s;toic &s;ect, hanged him&s;elf at ninety, for a <HI>whit|loe.</HI> It certainly was not &s;o trifling an ailment that overcame his temper; but his mind might be compared to a <HI>ballance,</HI> with philo&s;ophy in one &s;cale, plumb, and misfortunes dropping into the other, one by one, till they came both to poi&s;e in <HI>equilibrio;</HI> and then a feather turned the <HI>beam.</HI></P>
<P>I have always thought &s;toici&s;m both an ab&s;urd and a mi&s;taken pride. Expre&s;&s;ions and demon|&s;trations of grief, are as natural, as tho&s;e of joy; and ari&s;e often from nobler &s;entiments, and more generous motives. And yet, we manife&s;t the one, without re&s;erve, and conceal the other till our proud hearts break<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Shake&s;pear has given us a beautiful image of this unequal &s;truggle between philo&s;ophy and misfortune, in his Twelfth Night.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;She never told her grief,</L>
<L>But let concealment, like a worm i'th' bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her dama&s;k cheek; &s;he pined in thought,</L>
<L>And, with a green and yellow melancholy,</L>
<L>She &s;at like patience on a monument,</L>
<L>Smiling at grief.&mdash;</L></Q></NOTE>. To weep is wo|mani&s;h weakne&s;s, they cry, but there are tears
<PB N="74" REF="101">
which become the brave&s;t man. Sighs are the effect of &s;orrow, as well as laughter is of mirth; and both equally de&s;igned by nature to di&s;charge certain humours in the mind, &s;pringing from their re&s;pective &s;ources, which, if not &s;uffered to evacuate them&s;elves, might ultimately affect the body. If you backen a tumour, you corrupt the blood.</P>
<P>There is another vulgar error too, which has often &s;urpri&s;ed me; that <HI>gravity</HI> &s;hould &s;till im|po&s;e upon the world, as a &s;ign of wi&s;dom. Is it becau&s;e an <HI>owl</HI> was the arms of Athens, and the bird of Minerva? We &s;eem to have accepted the emblem literally, which the mythologi&s;ts tell us was de&s;igned rather as a caution again&s;t being impo&s;ed upon by outward appearances. Gravity generally proceeds from a defect of natural &s;pirit in youth, or a decay of it in age. When real, it is the effect merely of con&s;titution, or &s;tupidity, and, if a&s;&s;umed, it is either to conceal weakne&s;s, or to cover pride.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="102">That gravity is an imperfection may fairly be deduced from the natural cau&s;es of it, grief, misfortunes, &s;ickne&s;s, or old age. But &s;en&s;e is the parent of chearfulne&s;s&mdash;Addi&s;on joins vir|tue; for to the wicked may ju&s;tly be applied that &s;arca&s;m of Solomon's, <HI>They are mad when they are merry;</HI> In fine, good-humour is to mo|rals, what the &s;un is to nature, who&s;e light not only gilds the objects, but who&s;e warmth im|prove their virtue al&s;o. And in imitation of <HI>Carneades,</HI> who &s;tiled beauty <HI>Royalty without force,</HI> I &s;hall define chearfulne&s;s to be <HI>philo&s;ophy without reflection.</HI></P>

<P>MR. Andrews remained in this irk&s;ome &s;itu|ation, during almo&s;t four days, when, on the la&s;t of them, about &s;even o'clock in the evening, a per&s;on came limping into the room, and delivered him the following letter, dated London, two o'clock; the hand unknown.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MY gallant, generous, but unhappy friend, how &s;hall I acco&s;t you! I met with a pa|ragraph in one of the public prints, la&s;t night,
<PB N="76" REF="103">
about twelve o'clock, and above four&s;core miles from hence. It &s;hocked and alarmed me &s;o ex|tremely, that I in&s;tantly took hor&s;e, and have rode po&s;t hither, where I lie concealed at my attorney's hou&s;e. He has informed me of both the particulars relating to your di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;I cannot go on&mdash;I leave him to &s;ay the re&s;t&mdash;For none but a per&s;on <HI>hackneyed in the ways of men,</HI> can &s;peak without emotion, upon &s;uch a &s;ubject as this. Adieu, Adieu.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Charles Carewe.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter, &s;aid Mr. Andrews to the per&s;on who had delivered it to him, refers me to you, Sir, for tho&s;e particulars which relate to the bu&s;ine&s;s of it; and, as time pre&s;&s;es hard upon us at pre&s;ent, I beg that you will execute your commi&s;&s;ion without any manner of preface, or delay. I &s;hall obey you, Sir, replied the attor|ney, and will deliver my&s;elf in as few words, as the nature of the &s;ubject may admit. <HI>Pray pro|ceed.</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, Sir, that my fir&s;t ac|quaintance with Mr. Carewe, was&mdash;Dear Sir, cried Mr. Andrews, &s;ince I <HI>mu&s;t know</HI> that <HI>very intere&s;ting</HI> particular, I promi&s;e you to attend to it any time you plea&s;e, when we &s;hall be more at lei&s;ure. It cannot po&s;&s;ibly be nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="77" REF="104">
to relate, at pre&s;ent; therefore, pray good Sir, proceed. <HI>And &s;o I would, Sir, if you had not &s;topt my mouth. Then, as I was &s;aying, my fir&s;t ac|quaintance with Mr. Carewe</HI>&mdash;Indeed, Sir, I require not the lea&s;t account of your fir&s;t ac|quaintance with that gentleman, all I want to know, at this time, is, what your la&s;t confe|rence with him was? Why, really Sir, replied the attorney, I was coming to that point directly, if you had not twice interrupted me; and if a man of law is once &s;huffled out of the regular cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, d'ye take me, Sir, he will not readily again be able to bring on matters properly to <HI>an hearing;</HI> d'ye mind? I a&s;k your pardon, Sir, replied Mr. Andrews, I pray you go on, Sir, in your own way&mdash;<HI>For, I was born to &s;uffer!</HI> [a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Well then, as I &s;aid before, Sir, continued old <HI>Tautology,</HI> my fir&s;t acquaintance with Mr. Carewe, (who, by the by, is a very worthy client of mine, and indeed in other things, too, the man bears a good &s;ort of character) was his lodging five thou&s;and hard pounds in my hands, with directions to purcha&s;e for him into the <HI>four per cent.</HI> funds. To make &s;hort work of the matter, for I perceive that you don't love long &s;peeches, Sir, I actually did lay out this &s;ame five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for him, in the &s;aid <HI>four
<PB N="78" REF="105">
per cent.</HI> funds, as I told you before, he had given me commi&s;&s;ion to do.</P>
<P>Well, Sir&mdash;Upon my pre&s;enting him with the debentures, what con&s;ideration he gave me for my hone&s;ty, diligence, trouble, and di&s;|patch&mdash;for I did not keep him long in &s;u&s;pence, Sir&mdash;is not, by any manner of means, d'ye mark me, material at pre&s;ent, but I believe, Sir, that I may venture to let you &s;o far into the &s;ecret, as to inform you that it was no trifle. No trifle, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir. For indeed Mr. Ca|rewe, as I think I told you already, is a very worthy gentleman&mdash;A gentleman every inch of him, believe me, Sir&mdash;And he was certainly, much in the right of it too; for there is no &s;urer thing in the world, than that if you would have your bu&s;ine&s;s well done, you mu&s;t pay for it well. <HI>Live and let live,</HI> is the true maxim in trade, Sir. But that is neither here nor there, d'ye mind, to the pre&s;ent matter in hand; there|fore, you'll give me leave to have done with that part of the &s;tory, I pre&s;ume, Sir&mdash;<HI>Mo&s;t wil|lingly, indeed, good Sir.</HI></P>
<P>But to make a long &s;tory &s;hort, in order to have done with it, quite and clear, and not to detain you any longer from the bu&s;ine&s;s in agi|tation, Sir, there was one thing, and only that one thing, I ever knew him guilty of, which
<PB N="79" REF="106">
gave me but a &s;light opinion of him. I &s;peak above board, Sir, for they call me <HI>old Tell-truth,</HI> among my friends, and tho&s;e that are free with me&mdash;And that &s;ame thing, Sir, in a few words, was this:</P>
<P><HI>Oh!</HI> [a&s;ide.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Carewe employed me once, continued he, to pro&s;ecute his &s;ervant man, or man &s;ervant, as it is termed in the law books, for robbing him of a good new &s;pic and &s;pan &s;uit of cloaths, &s;ome &s;hirts, and other moveables, to a con&s;iderable value. For Mr. Carewe, Sir, was always a mo&s;t tearing beau. I had the vil|lain &s;et and taken, as nimble as he was, and lodged him in this very hou&s;e, as &s;afe as you are your&s;elf, Sir, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But what would you have of it, Sir, when the rogue was brought upon his tryal, no Mr. Ca|rewe appeared to &s;wear to the goods <HI>found upon him.</HI> Not in the very lea&s;t, Sir. No Mr. Ca|rewe appeared, though <HI>called upon his recognizance,</HI> three &s;everal times, by the cryer, with a <HI>laudible voice,</HI> Sir. And when my younker did not <HI>come
<PB N="80" REF="107">
and appear, to &s;ave his fine,</HI> the judge immediately ordered his forfeited recognizance to be forth|with <HI>e&s;treated</HI> into his maje&s;ty's exchequer, and the rogue was di&s;charged, for want of pro&s;ecu|tion.</P>
<P>I went off, Sir, hot foot, from the court, to Mr. Carewe's lodgings, to &s;ee whether he was alive or dead, and who &s;hould I find there, but my young dilly dally gentleman, in his night-cap and &s;lippers, &s;itting by the fire, and reading &s;ome conjuring book or other, that I could make neither head or tail of. Upon which I up, and told him a piece of my mind, very roundly, a&s;king him why the devil he had not come to court, and done ju&s;tice again&s;t his hang-dog Tim? But all the &s;atisfaction the dainty gentleman gave me, was, that a woman, with a parcel of children at her heels, had kept bawling and roaring in the hall, all the morning, and that as he had ever a mortal di&s;like to the crying of brats, he could not po&s;&s;ibly think of &s;tirring out of his room while they remained be|low. Pray did you ever hear now, &s;o fooli&s;h a rea&s;on, in all your life, Mr. Andrews, for not going to do what the law directs? <HI>I believe you might not have under&s;tood him, Sir</HI>&mdash;Not I truly, Sir, nor could any body el&s;e, I think, who had either &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on. But &s;o this fooli&s;h affair
<PB N="81" REF="108">
ended, after having co&s;t us a good round fine of fifty pounds, &s;terling, in &s;hining ca&s;h, Sir, be&s;ides my own bill of co&s;ts, which I warrant me totted to ten or twelve pieces more. A pretty bu&s;ine&s;s this truly, you'l &s;ay, Sir!</P>
<P><HI>I &s;ay nothing, Sir, and could wi&s;h, for charity &s;ake, that you had done &s;aying, al&s;o!</HI> I mu&s;t have done now, Sir, for I have nothing further to add upon this &s;ubject, that I can now recollect, &s;aid he, pau&s;ing.&mdash;<HI>Oh, Sir! for mercy &s;ake, proceed immediately to the bu&s;ine&s;s you have been &s;ent about, or I &s;hall be obliged to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger directly, to Mr. Carewe, to get that part of his let|ter, which relates to your errand, explained by him|&s;elf, Sir.</HI> There need be no manner of occa&s;ion for all that hurry, Sir, replied the attorney, for I will deliver it every word to you my&s;elf, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, without the lea&s;t delay, or adding to, or dimini&s;hing from, Sir&mdash;But fir&s;t, I mu&s;t beg you will be &s;o kind as to order me up a bottle of wine, Sir; for I don't know how it is, but I am a little dry and hoar&s;e, at pre&s;ent. But I was hurry &s;curry, there, Sir, and hurry &s;curry, here, Sir, and then talking away &s;o fa&s;t, to get plump to the matter in hand, that this may be the oc|ca&s;ion of it, perhaps, Sir&mdash;<HI>Very likely, Sir.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="82" REF="109">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE wine and gla&s;&s;es were laid upon the table, and after the attorney had &s;wal|lowed down half a dozen bumpers running, Well Sir, continued, or rather <HI>commenced</HI> he, the up&s;hot of the matter is this. Mr. Carewe came to my hou&s;e about two o'clock, or rather be|fore, this day, muffled up in a chair; and with|out &s;taying even to a&s;k me how I did, inquired of me whether I had heard any thing, &s;o and &s;o, as how he had been arre&s;ted on Ludgate-hill, had been re&s;cued by a gentleman, what was the con&s;equence? and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>I told him that the whole &s;tory was then cur|rent in the courts, for that the plaintiff's attor|ney, a very acute creditable man, had told every body he met with, as how one Mr. An|drews, who I pre&s;ume was you, Sir, after hav|ing delivered him from the bailiffs, was fool enough, I a&s;k pardon, Sir, to go to the creditor, and join him&s;elf in &s;ecurity for the money in &s;uit; and how he nabbed him there, in the very fact, on account of one of the hone&s;t fellows that had been de&s;perately wounded in the fray, and that he was then held to two thou&s;and
<PB N="83" REF="110">
pounds bail; which was the re&s;triction the court had laid him under, in re&s;entment for their af|fronted laws.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Carewe, &s;aid he, dropt tears, at the fir&s;t part of this &s;tory, though I really &s;aw no &s;uch crying matter in it; but he turned pale, and fell into a chair, by the time I had come to the latter part of it; overcome, I &s;uppo&s;e, by the fatiguing journey he had told me he had rode all the la&s;t night and this morning. Mr. Andrews was much affected at this recital&mdash; Mr. Carewe's di&s;tre&s;s augmented his own; for his compa&s;&s;ion extended it&s;elf even to the per&s;on through whom his own misfortune had fallen, upon him. However, he quick recollected him|&s;elf, and intreated the attorney to proceed, who thus went on:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mr. Carewe had a little recovered him&s;elf, he pulled the very identical five thou|&s;and pounds worth of four per cent. debentures out of his pocket, and putting half of them, to the amount of ju&s;t two thou&s;and five hundred pounds, into my hands, Run, fly, &s;aid he, in a perfect agony, to my generous and unhappy friend Mr. Andrews, &s;ummon the &s;heriff on the in&s;tant, depo&s;it with him, in&s;tead of bail, two thou&s;and pounds of the&s;e &s;ecurities, to &s;et that worthy gallant man at liberty&mdash; and oh! &s;end him
<PB N="84" REF="111">
quick as lightning to my grateful arms&mdash;I have have intru&s;ted you before, cried he, all in a breath, with my whole fortune&mdash;And there in|deed, perhaps he was right&mdash;How much higher a confidence do I repo&s;e in you now!&mdash;But this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion I could not, <HI>for the very blood of me,</HI> comprehend the meaning of, when I had actually but half of the debentures in my hands, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But he really &s;eemed to be a little <HI>non com</HI> him&s;elf, the man did, while he was &s;peaking to me; for you verily never did &s;ee any creature in &s;uch a <HI>hurry combu&s;tion,</HI> in all your life. Ju&s;t for all the world in &s;uch a <HI>twitter,</HI> as a girl going to be married, exactly. Run&mdash;fly&mdash;was the word at every hand's turn&mdash;Nay, he would not even &s;uffer me to &s;tay to eat a poor mor&s;el of dinner, nei|ther, which was ju&s;t then coming upon the ta|ble; an, excellent fowl, bacon and greens, with a piping hot &s;houlder of mutton, Sir, all of the very be&s;t meat that the markets could af|ford; for my <HI>cre&s;t</HI> has always been, Sir, <HI>Win gold and wear it,</HI> i'faith. Nothing le&s;s, Sir, as I was &s;aying, would &s;erve my gentleman, but out I mu&s;t go directly, or there would be no living in the hou&s;e for him.</P>
<P>So after I had &s;ettled a few papers in my de&s;k, Sir, and had put on my hat, gloves, and cloak,

looking for my cane for &s;ome time, which my &s;on Tommy had carried up to the nur&s;ery, for a <HI>hobby hor&s;e</HI>&mdash;Young things will play, Mr. An|drews&mdash;Mr. Carewe fidgetting and fidgetting about the parlour, all the while, I &s;allied out of the door, <HI>without any manner of delay,</HI> exactly as it &s;truck three o'clock, Sir.</P>

<P>THREE o'clock! cried out Mr. Andrews, and looking at his watch&mdash;'Tis now ju&s;t eight, and allowing an hour for your coming to this point, <HI>without any manner of delay,</HI> &s;ince you came in, what, in the name of prolixity and the law, could you have been doing, Sir, du|ring the other four hours?</P>
<P>Why there now, again Sir, you may ea&s;ily perceive from hence, the hurry and confu&s;ion that both Mr. Carewe and you had thrown me into; for it had made me near forgot one very material article of my errand, which this que&s;|tion of yours, now &s;tarted, has made me recol|lect again. I told you before, Sir, that Mr. Ca|rewe had given me debentures to the amount of two thou&s;and five hundred pounds &s;terling&mdash;The

fir&s;t two thou&s;and you know already, how that is to be applied; but now for the odd five hun|dred&mdash;Why this, Sir, Mr. Carewe de&s;ired me, as &s;oon as I &s;hould have di&s;patched you off to him, to po&s;t away to the banker with, to re|lea&s;e his bond, with your counter-obligation, and bring them to him directly; that he might have the <HI>hone&s;t plea&s;ure,</HI> as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, of delivering them up cancelled to you, him&s;elf, Sir.</P>
<P>Well Sir&mdash;when I had now gotten into the middle of the &s;treet, &s;afe and &s;ound out of his clutches, and found my&s;elf at liberty of think|ing and acting according to my own judgment or experience of matters and things, I began to con&s;ider with my&s;elf, that my be&s;t way, un|doubtedly, would be fir&s;t to hye me to the banker's, before I came to you, Sir; arguing the point pro and con, in my own mind, thus: Should I defer this bu&s;ine&s;s till the evening, I may po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;s of my chap, for he may be gone abroad; but as for Mr. Andrews, I &s;hall be &s;ure of finding the gentleman at home, at any hour; for he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tay till I call upon him. Ay, ay, <HI>bonum &s;ecurum</HI> is the word there. At dinner is the &s;ure&s;t time of meeting with a man of bu&s;ine&s;s at his own hou&s;e, and I can al&s;o by this means, <HI>kill two birds with
<PB N="87" REF="114">
one &s;tone,</HI> and pick up a meal for my&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, in &s;pite of all Mr. Carewe's <HI>hurry and flu&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>I judged the thing for the be&s;t, I thought, taking every circum&s;tance together; and &s;o, without any more <HI>ifs or ands,</HI> away I hied me to the bank, as fa&s;t as my legs, which are none of the be&s;t, could carry me. I found the gentle|man at home, as I &s;urmi&s;ed, I told him my er|rand, he was overjoyed, invited me to &s;it down at table with him, and indeed, to do him ju&s;|tice, made as much of me, as man could do.</P>
<P>While we were at dinner, continued he, the banker &s;ent one of his clerks to the attorney, acquainting him with the bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;iring him to attend immediately, and &s;ee very thing performed according to law. He came on the &s;ummons, and after I had paid the money, and that we had taken our jolly bottles apiece, and a <HI>peremptory,</HI> I acquainted them with the other commi&s;&s;ion I was going to tran&s;act; and &s;o came off hither, without &s;top or &s;tay, only ju&s;t calling upon a client of mine, for about half an hour, as it happened to lie directly in my way. Bu&s;i|ne&s;s mu&s;t be done, you know, Sir. But for all my hurry, I did not neglect the main chance, you &s;ee, added he, throwing two papers on the table, for there are the <HI>girth and circingle,</HI> my
<PB N="88" REF="115">
boy&mdash;Five hundred pounds &s;terling, with intere&s;t and co&s;ts, (which latter, by the bye, Mr. Carewe owes me yet) was a plaguy dear purcha&s;e truly, for &s;uch dirty &s;craps of paper&mdash;But law is law, Sir.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews lo&s;t all manner of patience, by this time, and ringing the bell, &s;ent off directly for his friend the &s;heriff, intreating him to come immediately, and take the &s;ecurities from the attorney, as he dare not venture to let this <HI>tedious impertinent</HI> go to the office to make the depo&s;it him&s;elf, or &s;uffer him one moment out of his &s;ight, till he might be at liberty al&s;o, to i&s;&s;ue forth along with him.</P>

<P>THE &s;heriff returned with the me&s;&s;enger, on the in&s;tant, but brought this unwel|come piece of news, at the &s;ame time, that about half an hour before, a certificate had been lodged in the office, by the &s;urgeon who at|tended the bailiff, that upon that evening's dre&s;&s;ing, he had found the wound to have proved mortal; after which notice, added he, I am &s;orry to acquaint you that it is not in the power
<PB N="89" REF="116">
of our office, to accept of bail, without a &s;pecial order of court.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews then turning toward the attor|ney, &s;aid with a grave, but dejected air, I thank you, Sir, for this; and I hope that Mr. Carewe will reprove you too, with the &s;ame temper. I under&s;tand you, Sir, replied he, but having done every thing for the be&s;t, as I told you be|fore, I am not to be chargeable with the con|&s;equences, d'ye mark. Bu&s;ine&s;s, let me tell you, Sir, (becau&s;e you really &s;eem to be a per|fect &s;tranger to it) bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;ay, is not to be &s;cuttled away, as fa&s;t as this man, or that man, or t'other man, take it into their <HI>wi&s;e noddles;</HI> as if they thought of nothing all the while, but their own convenience, for&s;ooth. But I find that I have no more bu&s;ine&s;s here, at pre&s;ent, Sir, and as I hate loitering where I have nothing to do, I &s;hall e'en <HI>pack up my awls,</HI> and return home to Mr. Carewe, again, with his two thou&s;and pounds, &s;afe and &s;ound, out of all man|ner of <HI>jeopardy</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure my delay was lucky for him, at lea&s;t. So &s;aying, he took up his <HI>hat, gloves, cloak, cane, girth, and circingle,</HI> filled up a brimmer, drank the <HI>clerk of the crown's prayer</HI> to Mr. Andrews, and hobbled down &s;tairs.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="117">The &s;heriff, who was really a very good kind of man, &s;taid for an hour behind him, to con|&s;ole his friend; and told him he had hopes, even if the bailiff &s;hould die, from former in|&s;tances of the &s;ame kind, that upon its appear|ing to be a &s;udden thing, merely accidental, and without any manner of malice praepen&s;e, on your part, &s;aid he, together with the remarkable &s;obriety and excellence of your character, the crown may be induced to make a favourable di&s;tinction, upon the repre&s;entation of the court, between the acce&s;&s;ory and the principal.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, replied Mr. Andrews, for your kind wi&s;hes; but, free from guilt, I am devoid of fear. I would not yet die, becau&s;e nature &s;eems yet unwilling to relea&s;e me&mdash;but, if providence &s;hall think fit to &s;uper&s;ede her laws, heaven's will be done, and I &s;hall &s;ubmit, without repining.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit and virtue of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, drew tears from the &s;heriff's eyes&mdash;and &s;o they would have done from the hang-man. Farewel, mo&s;t excellent young man, &s;aid he, embracing him, and retired.</P>

<P>JUST after he went away, the following let|ter was delivered to Mr. Andrews:

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS vile attorney has rendered me a mo&s;t &s;hocking account of his principal commi&s;&s;ion. But who can one tru&s;t, who de|pend upon! A common porter would have been a better, though not &s;o proper an agent. I could have &s;tabbed him, but your danger has made a coward of me. Fear not, however, notwith&s;tanding the unpromi&s;ing appearances of this night, I have a &s;cheme in re&s;olve, which may &s;et you free to-morrow. My life, and fortunes, are dedicated to you.

</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter appeared quite enigmatical; but Mr. Andrews read, prayed, and went to bed, in expectation of the next day's event. No mea&s;ure re&s;ted upon him&s;elf, and his anxiety was therefore le&s;s, than it would have been had any i&s;&s;ue depended upon his own conduct.</P>
<P>The next morning he was informed, that, as &s;oon as the King's Bench had met, a coun&s;el,
<PB N="92" REF="119">
on the part of Mr. Carewe, had moved the court, &s;etting forth the whole &s;tory of Mr. An|drews's accidental and unmerited misfortune, confe&s;&s;ing that Mr. Carewe him&s;elf had wounded the bailiff, before Mr. Andrews had come up, and offering, on condition that Mr. Andrews &s;hould be admitted to bail, to &s;urrender Mr. Ca|rewe into cu&s;tody, to take his tryal, &s;hould the bailiff die. The court was extremely &s;truck at the genero&s;ity of the propo&s;ition, but &s;aying that the laws admitted of no commutation in in &s;uch ca&s;es, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the motion.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of his own &s;oul, was a&s;toni&s;hed at the magnanimity of Mr. Carewe's; and wept then, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince his confinement; crying out, this is a man, indeed, worth living for! yet I may die, perhaps, without the happine&s;s of any farther commerce with him! Say, &s;ay, ye learned in the philo&s;ophy of nature, is there on earth a tran&s;port higher than the embrace of &s;uch a friend! But I cannot fly to his arms, nor dare he venture into mine.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he had fini&s;hed this expre&s;&s;ion, Mr. Carewe, with a flow pace, and dejected air, entered the room, moving up toward Mr. An|drews, who upon &s;eeing him, &s;prang back from his chair, crying out, Gracious heaven, Sir,
<PB N="93" REF="120">
what has brought you into this horrid place? My own extravagance and vice, and your virtue and misfortune, replied he, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, embracing his knees, and intreating his pity and forgivene&s;s. Mr. Andrews, endea|vouring to rai&s;e him, &s;unk into his arms.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS obliged to clo&s;e the la&s;t chapter &s;ome|what abruptly, becau&s;e I began to perceive my generous reader too much affected, my&s;elf not le&s;s &s;o, to &s;uffer me to continue the re&s;t of the &s;tory, in <HI>de&s;cription.</HI> Therefore, for the mu|tual ea&s;e of both our <HI>nerves,</HI> I &s;hall conclude the remainder of it, in &s;imple <HI>narrative</HI> only.</P>
<P>Upon Mr. Carewe's having heard that his motion had been rejected by the court, he walked about his room, for &s;ome time, like a di&s;tracted per&s;on&mdash;Then &s;itting down, for a while, compo&s;ed in thought, &s;tarted &s;uddenly up again, and, on the in&s;tant, ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the &s;heriff, and was immediately conducted to the <HI>Compter.</HI></P>
<P>The principle, upon which he took this ex|traordinary &s;tep, was this: He feared that if
<PB N="94" REF="121">
Mr. Andrews &s;hould be tried alone, he might, in all probability, &s;uffer, as being the only de|linquent taken for the fact. But that &s;hould the principal take his tryal along with him, he hoped that the puni&s;hment of the chief aggre&s;&s;or, might be deemed &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction for ju&s;tice, and incline the court to extend its favour toward the innocent and accidental accomplice. Oh! &s;hould this gallant friend &s;uffer for my crime, cried he out, what a legacy of life would he leave me! I can die with courage, but I cannot live with igno|miny&mdash;Death is but an in&s;tant&mdash;Infamy is im|mortal! I a&s;k pardon of my readers. But I am not <HI>de&s;cribing,</HI> I am only <HI>repeating.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e pair of extraordinary friends pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome minutes together, in mutual admiration of each other's worth, not knowing how to expre&s;s their heart-felt &s;entiments of &s;uch unmodern vir|tue, when they were relieved from their diffi|culty, by the ha&s;ty entrance of the &s;heriff, who running up and embracing Mr. Andrews, cried out, in a tran&s;port of congratulation, Joy, joy, my dear friend, and to you, Sir, al&s;o, turning to Mr. Carewe, for two of the mo&s;t eminent &s;urgeons in London, whom I called in my&s;elf, to attend the bailiff's dre&s;&s;ing, this morning, have pronounced him ab&s;olutely out of danger, and even in a condition to walk abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="122">While the two friends attended earne&s;tly to this di&s;cour&s;e, he thus went on: I confe&s;s, &s;aid he, that I was much &s;urpri&s;ed, la&s;t night, upon finding &s;uch a notice &s;erved upon my office, &s;o &s;hortly after my having been informed in the courts, ju&s;t as I was going home to dinner, that the bailiff had been pronounced to be in a fair way of recovery. I began to &s;u&s;pect, from this circum&s;tance, that there had been &s;ome foul play intended, from &s;ome quarter or other, in this affair, and therefore re&s;olved within my&s;elf, for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice, humanity and friend&s;hip, to call in two of the able&s;t &s;urgeons in the city, at my own expence, to attend the dre&s;&s;ing of my patient, this morning. However, I did not mention any thing of this purpo&s;e to you la&s;t night, added he, turning to Mr. Andrews, think|ing it not proper to amu&s;e you, le&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s might not have an&s;wered my hopes and expec|tations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="34" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE former &s;urgeon, continued he, who was by at this report, appeared to be ex|tremely confounded, and &s;neaked immediately after out of the room. This &s;trengthened my
<PB N="96" REF="123">
&s;u&s;picion, and running ha&s;tily after him, down &s;tairs, ju&s;t as he had gained the thre&s;hold of the door, I &s;eized him by the collar, pretending to have a warrant for him, in my pocket, upon an information of a collu&s;ion with &s;ome certain per&s;on, to impo&s;e his patient's danger on the court, for &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e or other.</P>
<P>His fright betrayed his guilt, and upon a pro|mi&s;e of indemnity he immediately confe&s;&s;ed to me, that the banker's attorney had called upon him in a great hurry, the evening before, and prevailed on him, with a fee of twenty guineas, to make a fal&s;e return upon his patient's ca&s;e; with a de&s;ign, as I apprehend, &s;aid he, to &s;krew money out of the pri&s;oner, in order to be ad|mitted to bail.</P>
<P>I was tran&s;ported with joy, &s;aid the &s;heriff, at this fortunate di&s;covery; but re&s;olving not to &s;uffer it to re&s;t here, I &s;ent immediately for a coach, and carried him, with the two other &s;ur|geons, along with me, to court, ordering the wounded bailiff, by their permi&s;&s;ion, to follow us in a chair.</P>
<P>I got a coun&s;el then to move the bench, on your behalf, and after a thorough examination into this iniquitous affair, and our producing the patient on the table, the court directed a pro|&s;ecution again&s;t the attorney, at the &s;uit of the crown, and granted me permi&s;&s;ion to come
<PB N="97" REF="124">
immediately and &s;et you both at liberty, the bench having been ju&s;t at that in&s;tant informed, that you, Sir, &s;aid he, and turning to Mr. Ca|rewe, had &s;urrendered your&s;elf up into the &s;he|riff's office, this morning, upon the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of your extraordinary, and unprecedented motion.</P>
<P>They all mutually embraced each other, and Mr. Andrews and Mr. Carewe made the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments to the &s;heriff, for his generous and active &s;ervices; intreating the en|joyment of his company, for the remainder of the day, in &s;ome &s;afe and retired &s;cene, beyond the city wards, upon Mr. Carewe's account; where, by the help of friendly conver&s;e, they might endeavour to forget the irk&s;omene&s;s of their late adventure.</P>
<P>The &s;heriff excu&s;ed him&s;elf, on account of the bu&s;ine&s;s of his office, and Mr. Carewe, at parting, put a bill of fifty pounds into his hands, de&s;iring him to di&s;charge the compter fees, to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf his own expences of &s;ur|geons, coun&s;el, &amp;c. and to give the remainder to the bailiff. He an&s;wered that he would cer|tainly execute the fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ions, but begged to be excu&s;ed from per|forming the &s;econd, &s;aying, that he was no at|torney, and that providence had ble&s;&s;ed him with a fortune which could afford <HI>to treat him</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing can po&s;&s;ibly demon&s;trate the vera|city of the&s;e memoirs, more than my two la&s;t chapters; for the &s;udden tran&s;ition, from the danger of the two friends, to their &s;afety, is certainly again&s;t all rules of novel, what&s;oever. But &s;o it happened, and &s;o I was bound to relate it. It is a common <HI>the&s;is</HI> of &s;chool declamation, whether or no it would have been a prudent mea&s;ure in the Carthagi|nians, immediately after the battle of Cannae, to have marched up directly, to the gates of Rome?

<P>Had I been at liberty to have &s;uffered events to wait upon the lei&s;ure of invention, how plea|&s;ant would it be to have locked up the reader in the goal with them, for a week or ten days longer? The turnkey bringing them accounts, from time to time, of the &s;till increa&s;ing danger
<PB N="100" REF="127">
of the bailiff? At length, he is given over, and then he dies, and then they are both in&s;tantly loaded with irons.</P>
<P>After which, I might have related, <HI>how,</HI> as they were tran&s;mitting from the <HI>compter,</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> they were interrupted by a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, which, upon enquiry, they found to be the afore&s;aid bailiff, going to be buried&mdash; And <HI>how,</HI> upon its taking wind, no matter <HI>how,</HI> among the populace, that the&s;e pair of unfor|tunate friends were the culprits for the fact, they were fir&s;t in&s;ulted, and then pelted &s;o fu|riou&s;ly with &s;tones, or brick-bats, no matter which, that if it was not for the guard, mo&s;t <HI>luckily</HI> coming up in the nick, firing among the mob, and killing &s;even or eight poor innocent men, women, and children, who had taken no manner of part in the fray, but only &s;tood gaping on&mdash;I &s;ay, that was it not for this &s;ame unexpected and <HI>timely relief,</HI> which <HI>favoured their e&s;cape,</HI> they would never have <HI>lived to be hanged,</HI> you may depend upon it.</P>
<P>Well, but after their <HI>re&s;cue,</HI> I might have lodged them, <HI>&s;afe and &s;ound,</HI> in the dungeon, for a week, on ten days longer, till their tryals are brought on; during which interval, I could have highly <HI>entertained</HI> the reader, (who has vo|luntarily confined him&s;elf to the &s;ame <HI>condemned

<P>As <HI>how</HI> one man finding another in bed with his wife, did, <HI>contrary to his maje&s;ty's peace, his crown and dignity, and contrary to the &s;tatute, in that ca&s;e made and provided,</HI> blow out the cuckolder's brains, with a <HI>charged</HI> pi&s;tol, which he happened <HI>luckily</HI> to have in his hand, <HI>at the very time.</HI> That the adultere&s;s had pro&s;ecuted, and convicted him for the fact; notwith&s;tanding it had been <HI>&s;pecially</HI> argued, by his coun&s;el, that jointure-wives &s;hould never be admitted as evidence again&s;t their hu&s;bands, becau&s;e they are to be <HI>gainers by the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;uit.</HI></P>

<P>And after I had held the reader in pain, for his two friends, <HI>quantum &s;ufficit,</HI> had brought them into the dock, and arraigned them at the

bar, I might have introduced the <HI>officious</HI> &s;heriff, afore&s;aid, leading in the &s;uppo&s;ed dead bailiff, by the hand, and making a di&s;covery of the whole &s;ham, contrived by, &amp;c.

<P>MR. Andrews and Mr. Carewe dined, &s;up|ped, and lay, at <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> that night, Mr. Carewe not thinking it prudent to re|turn to London, for the rea&s;ons he had al|ready given to Mr. Andrews, for quitting it im|mediately after his re&s;cue. They were &s;en&s;ible of a mutual &s;atisfaction in each other's conver&s;e, and &s;everal polite expre&s;&s;ions were exchanged between them, during the cour&s;e of that even|ing.</P>
<P>But when Mr. Carewe began to compliment his friend, upon the genero&s;ity of his late beha|viour, Mr. Andrews interrupted him, by &s;aying, that it would rather humble him, in his own opinion, to be prai&s;ed for what, in honour of human nature, he hoped were but common me|rits. My fir&s;t act, &s;aid he, was but the u&s;ual
<PB N="107" REF="134">
impul&s;e of manhood; and the &s;econd, but the re&s;ult of common hone&s;ty, only&mdash;Your conduct, indeed, upon this occa&s;ion, has been truly no|ble.&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, interrupted Mr. Carewe, &s;ince you will not indulge me, Sir, in the real plea&s;ure of dwelling on your prai&s;e, &s;pare me, at lea&s;t, the aukward unea&s;ine&s;s of li&s;tening to my own. Let us, rather, added he, &s;ince we are, I hope, from this day, cemented friends for life, con|trive, after &s;ome &s;ort, to commence our ac|quaintance earlier, by mutually relating to each other, the private hi&s;tory of tho&s;e aera's, which have preceded our fir&s;t meeting; &s;o as, in a manner, to retrieve pa&s;t time, and thus take hands, as it were, together, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, through life.</P>
<P>With all my heart, replied Mr. Andrews; but as the evening is now too far &s;pent, that you have declared your purpo&s;e of retiring farther into the country, to-morrow, and that I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily return to pro&s;ecute my fortunes, at London, let us defer entering upon this propo|&s;ition, till we may hereafter, be more at lei&s;ure together; and, for the pre&s;ent, we'll pa&s;s the &s;hort remnant of our contracted &s;pan, in a more general conver&s;e.</P>

<P>I Dined, &s;aid Mr. Andrews, at the inn, and, after I had changed my dre&s;s, I went imme|diately to pay my compliments to mi&s;s Beville. I met Mrs. Beville in the hall, ordering &s;ome wine into the parlour, where I heard a great noi&s;e of ru&s;tic mirth, going forward. I &s;aluted her, and enquired, with earne&s;tne&s;s, how her daughter was? She &s;ighed, and replied, that &s;he had been, for a con&s;iderable time, ill of
<PB N="109" REF="136">
&s;omething like a &s;low fever on her &s;pirits, had loathed food, and declined company; that a phy&s;ician had been called in, &s;everal times, but that it had been with great difficulty &s;he could be at all per&s;uaded to u&s;e any of his pre&s;criptions; and that the few which &s;he had been prevailed on to take, had yet produced no vi&s;ible effect upon her health.</P>
<P>She added, that, for a week pa&s;t, &s;he had con|fined her&s;elf intirely to her chamber; and that, though this was her birth-day, upon which oc|ca&s;ion her father had invited &s;ome friends to dinner, in order to tempt her down &s;tairs, to do the honours of the table, &s;he had declined it, by &s;aying, after her pre&s;ent low-&s;pirited manner, <HI>that it would be in&s;incere in her to affect rejoicing at her birth.</HI> Mrs. Beville then pre&s;&s;ed me to go into the parlour, but I refu&s;ed it, telling her that I always avoided every occa&s;ion of drinking; and that &s;ince mi&s;s Beville had refu&s;ed rejoicing, upon the pre&s;ent one, it would certainly be ex|tremely ungalant in me, to make merry on it.</P>
<P>After this, &s;he kindly a&s;ked me where I had been <HI>this age,</HI> as &s;he was &s;o obliging to term it; which inquiry I happily took advantage of, by replying that I had been &s;tudying phy&s;ic, ever &s;ince; adding, with an affected &s;pirit, that as quacks &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, where the <HI>faculty</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="137">
have failed, perhaps I might be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>no&s;trum,</HI> or other, which might po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore the fair invalid to her health and &s;pirits again. She replied, that &s;he really believed poor Fanny would be glad to &s;ee me, for that &s;he had always &s;eemed plea&s;ed with my company, and had al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed me with particular regards, as her dear brother's friend. I bowed, and &s;he led the way up &s;tairs, to her daughter's apart|ment.</P>
<P>When I entered the room, I &s;aw her &s;itting at a table, with a pen and ink, and a paper ju&s;t written, lying before her. She appeared pale and languid, and had a certain air of melancholy diffu&s;ed over all her features. She did not per|ceive me at fir&s;t, as her mother walked in before me, I advanced to &s;alute her, and &s;he &s;eemed &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e; &s;he ro&s;e to receive me, trembled when I took her hand, faltered in at|tempting to &s;peak, and in&s;tantly fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>I carried her to the couch, loo&s;ed her &s;tays, and bared her lovely bo&s;om, while Mrs. Beville &s;prinkled water on her face and neck; &s;he at length opened her eyes, with a great &s;igh, but quickly perceiving the &s;ituation and di&s;order &s;he was in before me, &s;he fell into the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion; which her mother endeavoured to qualify,
<PB N="111" REF="138">
by &s;aying never mind it, my dear child, for this gentleman has become a phy&s;ician, &s;ince you &s;aw him la&s;t, and a <HI>de&s;habille,</HI> you know, is nothing between doctor and patient.</P>
<P>I turned immediately a&s;ide, toward the table, to leave her at liberty to compo&s;e her handker|chief, which while her mother and &s;he were ad|ju&s;ting, I was tempted to run my eye ha&s;tily over the manu&s;cript, that lay open before me, in which I read the following lines:</P>

<P>The &s;en&s;ations which affected me on reading this paper, are not to be de&s;cribed. I was very near wanting the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance my&s;elf, which had been ju&s;t &s;upplied to her. Where I expected to meet a birth-day ode, as the title had pro|mi&s;ed me, I was &s;hocked with a funeral elegy, rather. Sadne&s;s, at other times, may ari&s;e from &s;ome &s;udden lo&s;s, or tran&s;ient misfortune&mdash;The grief may be but temporary &mdash; But when a &s;ea&s;on, otherwi&s;e of joy, &s;hall &s;upply occa&s;ion of melan|cholic reflection, it betrays the ingrained com|plexion of the mind. Throughout the whole poem &s;he prefers death to life, and &s;eems to

<P>I did not appear to have taken any manner of notice of the paper, which, the moment &s;he recollected, &s;he &s;prang forward, turned upon the table, and blu&s;hed at the &s;ame time; which quick re&s;tored her &s;u&s;pended beauties, and made her &s;eem, at that in&s;tant, more lovely to my eyes, than methought I had ever &s;een her before.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked her about the &s;tate of her health; how long &s;he had been ill, after what manner affected; and at the &s;ame time made a phy&s;ical pretence, of feeling her pul&s;e, for the natural one, of touching her hand. She an&s;wered me every que&s;tion, with as much gravity as &s;he would have done to a regular phy&s;ician, only that &s;he &s;eemed to &s;eize, with a certain quickne&s;s, an opportunity from thence, of accounting for her late emotion, by adding, that &s;he had dreamed, the night before, that I was dead, and the tediou&s;ne&s;s of her di&s;|order had reduced her mind, as well as her body, to &s;uch a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, that the &s;ud|denne&s;s of my appearance before her, &s;o little expected, had &s;truck her, &s;ome how, as if it had been a vi&s;ion.</P>

<P>MRS. Beville, <HI>on ho&s;pitable cares intent,</HI> fre|quently quitted the room, to order in wine to the company below &s;tairs, and give the nece&s;&s;ary directions about her hou&s;hold affairs; which left her charming daughter and me, at greater liberty to entertain each other. Mi&s;s Be|ville, in one of the&s;e intervals, a&s;ked me what was the whim of her mother in &s;tiling me a phy|&s;ician, ju&s;t now? I repeated our conver&s;ation below &s;tairs, and told her that this was a pre|tence I had luckily framed, extempore, in order to intitle me to the privilege of being admitted to vi&s;it her in her pre&s;ent retired and invalid &s;tate. However, added I, the &s;cience of phy&s;ic is not &s;o deep a mi&s;tery, neither, as that com|mon &s;en&s;e need be at a lo&s;s upon every occa&s;ion, how to pre&s;cribe; and in your ca&s;e, Madam, &s;aid I, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, that I may be able, without a <HI>diploma,</HI> to retrieve your health, e'er long.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered that &s;he was very willing to &s;ubmit to my pre&s;criptions; adding, that if faith in the doctor, was an help to medicine, no phy&s;ician could po&s;&s;ibly meet with better &s;ucce&s;s,
<PB N="115" REF="142">
in a patient. This &s;he pronounced with a &s;mile, but a blu&s;h at the &s;ame time&mdash;The highe&s;t charms of female beauty, joined at once in one!</P>
<P>She then inquired of me, with a mode&s;t, down-ca&s;t look, and he&s;itating voice, to what fortunate cri&s;is &s;he was indebted for the plea&s;ure of my pre&s;ent vi&s;it? Then rai&s;ing up her head and voice, a little, hoped that I had returned from Germany, loaded with laurels, and brought home trophies to add to the antient and pre&s;ent glory of England; with other railleries of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>I &s;miled at her humour, and told her, as was in truth, the ca&s;e, that I had been trifled with by my father, who, after &s;everal vague &s;chemes for my e&s;tabli&s;hment in life, had at length, left me at liberty to &s;eek out my own fortunes; but that my di&s;appointments were, at pre&s;ent, greatly qualified, by the extreme plea&s;ure I re|ceived in being allowed to behold and conver&s;e with her once more. That I began now to look upon my&s;elf to be my own <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> but would willingly exchange that vain prerogative, for the higher privilege of becoming her &s;lave, if &s;he had not already engaged one more worthy to be commanded.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="143">She turned her eyes quick upon me, with a regard of emotion and &s;urpri&s;e; but collecting her&s;elf again, in an in&s;tant, replied in a low and &s;oftened tone of voice, that politene&s;s afforded men great advantages, becau&s;e it indulged them the privilege of &s;peaking in a kind of equivocal &s;tile, which none but women who had been bred at courts, could po&s;&s;ibly have addre&s;s enough to an&s;wer. I replied, that though ga|lantry might po&s;&s;ibly admit of &s;uch hollow lan|guage, it had never yet obtained a currency, in friend&s;hip; and that, if &s;he would but grant me permi&s;&s;ion, I would explain my&s;elf more expli|citly, upon this &s;ubject, to her brother. She blu&s;hed, and bowed&mdash;I ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and retired.</P>

<P>I HAD come down to Wind&s;or, you may remember, continued Mr. Andrews, in or|der to &s;atisfy my&s;elf more fully, about my &s;cru|ples of love and honour; but perhaps you may think that I had here drawn too ha&s;ty a conclu|&s;ion, from the premi&s;&s;es. Po&s;&s;ibly too, there
<PB N="117" REF="144">
may appear at lea&s;t as much of vanity as of ge|nero&s;ity, in this precipitation.</P>
<P>But you'll indulge me, I hope, in the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction on this pa&s;&s;age, by &s;up|po&s;ing rather, that the &s;trength of my own pa&s;|&s;ion, might have &s;uper-added a degree of evi|dence to her's; and that having thus wrought the matter up to a moral certainty, at lea&s;t, it would have been mo&s;t indelicate, be&s;ides &s;eeming to rate my purcha&s;e too high, to have required a more explicit declaration.</P>
<P>A delicate lover will never force his mi&s;tre&s;s, to a <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;She lo&s;es a good deal of her price, by &s;uch a frankne&s;s; and too <HI>categorical</HI> a cer|tainty, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be allowed, le&s;&s;ens al&s;o con&s;iderably, the refinement of his own plea&s;ures. There is <HI>a &s;ubordination</HI> in love, of that nice and peculiar nature, that, if once de|&s;troyed, can never be re&s;tored; and the &s;tate, thenceforward, either becomes anarchical, with|out any order at all, or inverted, by inferiors bearing &s;way. Until the avowal, a woman re|&s;erves to her&s;elf, the privileges of her &s;ex, but at that in&s;tant re&s;igns her whole prerogative. Na|ture &s;eems to have from the fir&s;t, endowed them with this empire, and a &s;alique law here, would be di&s;&s;olute rebellion. <HI>The confe&s;&s;ion</HI> humbles a woman too much, and a polite, or prudent
<PB N="118" REF="145">
lover &s;hould never &s;uffer his mi&s;tre&s;s to abate the opinion of her own value. The conferring of favours, pre&s;erves the whole &s;pirit of this pa&s;|&s;ion, which &s;ickens and dies away, whenever they come to be challenged as a right.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, is not <HI>the confe&s;&s;ion</HI> either needle&s;s, or uncertain? are there not &s;urer tokens of a pa&s;|&s;ion, even than words or actions? Is the love which declares, or the one that <HI>betrays</HI> it&s;elf, the &s;tronge&s;t? And is a premeditated &s;peech or mo|tion, or an involuntary &s;igh or emotion, the mo&s;t certain &s;ign? Love is the great purpo&s;e, and plea&s;ure of our lives, and yet how few of either &s;ex, are capable of that oeconomy, deli|cacy, or addre&s;s, which are requi&s;ite to heighten or confirm its joys, by ze&s;t or permanency?</P>

<P>I readily accepted the invitation, but upon this condition, that <HI>my patient</HI> &s;hould not be &s;uf|fered to quit her apartment &s;o &s;uddenly; for that it had often proved fatal, the having mi&s;taken &s;pirits for &s;trength&mdash;That as I had accidentally a&s;&s;umed the character of a phy&s;ician, I would humour the title a little farther, by directing the proper meats to be &s;ent up to her from table, and &s;hould do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of waiting on her in the evening, to drink tea, feel her pul&s;e, and receive her commands to the <HI>lodge.</HI> The&s;e preliminaries were agreed to, and I went to dine with the father and mother, at the appointed hour.</P>
<P>I directed &s;ome broth, and a little white meat, to be carried up to my patient, and then ordered her a large gla&s;s of wine, with very little water in it; which latter part of the pre&s;cription Mrs. Beville objected to, &s;aying that it might perhaps inflame her blood, as &s;he had not ta&s;ted any thing &s;tronger than tea, for a con&s;iderable time. 'Tis for that rea&s;on I direct it, &s;aid I, for
<PB N="120" REF="147">
in all depre&s;&s;ions of the &s;pirits, <HI>we of the faculty,</HI> madam, u&s;ually pre&s;cribe high cordials, in order to rai&s;e a fever, and then any di&s;pen&s;atory can point out the cure; which admirable expedient &s;aves <HI>us,</HI> madam, a world of trouble, in certain difficult ca&s;es.</P>
<P>We thus amu&s;ed the time during dinner, which I thought a mo&s;t tedious meal, as I was become then more impatient of returning to my charming Fanny, than ever I had been before. I began to con&s;ider her now, in a more intere&s;t|ing light; no longer as one who might merely fill up the vacancies, or amu&s;e the intervals of life, but as the &s;ole per&s;on who was both to in&s;pirit the bu&s;ine&s;s, and relieve the cares of it&mdash;at once to heighten and refine its plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I &s;oon ro&s;e from table, &s;aying that, like a Turk, I preferred coffee to wine, and that a phy&s;ician &s;hould always pre&s;erve his blood in an equal temperature, for fear of &s;ometimes mi&s;|taking his own pul&s;e for his patient's. Then taking Mrs. Beville by the hand, I led her up &s;tairs, to her daughter's apartment.</P>

<P>MISS Beville was dre&s;&s;ed with the nice&s;t elegance and gaiety, and &s;eemed ex|tremely recovered &s;ince the evening before, both in her looks and &s;pirits, though &s;till weak and pale. I therefore, in order to &s;ave her the fa|tigue of exerting her&s;elf to entertain me, engro&s;|&s;ed the di&s;cour&s;e mo&s;tly to my&s;elf, by repeating to her every incident which had happened to me &s;ince we parted la&s;t, to which I added all the articles of news, both foreign and dome&s;tic, which were then current in London. Among the re&s;t, I related to her the &s;tory of our adven|ture, my dear Carewe, &s;aid he, and &s;he wept, and wondered, both at the virtue, and the vice of my recital.</P>
<P>I wrought out an occa&s;ion, from &s;ome part of my di&s;cour&s;e, of comparing with di&s;advantage, all the plea&s;ures I had experienced in London, united together, to the &s;ingle one I had left be|hind me at Wind&s;or; adding, that even this, tho' the &s;ame, was far tran&s;cended by the pre&s;ent enjoyment, as the total exclu&s;ion of every wan|dering thought, of every alien &s;cheme of plea|&s;ure, had now left this favourite one at liberty to occupy my heart and mind intire.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="149">Oh! my dear Carewe, cried he out in a rapture, there is &s;omewhat in the rich endow|ment of a cha&s;te woman's love, which exceeds all human bli&s;s&mdash;How low is ambition, how poor are riches, how in&s;ipid is plea&s;ure, when void of this enlivening &s;pirit! Love cannot be deemed a di&s;tinct pa&s;&s;ion, but rather the inform|ing &s;oul of every other &s;entiment or affection in the human brea&s;t. It refre&s;hes labour, relieves care, and gives enjoyment to plea&s;ure. It not only in&s;pirits our moral, but even religion is but cold philo&s;ophy, without it. I a&s;k pardon, &s;aid he, for this enthu&s;ia&s;tic digre&s;&s;ion, for with|out experience, all this rapture mu&s;t appear but Platonic vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>My dear friend, replied Mr. Carewe, you rave not to me, and perhaps I may have con|ceived &s;till an higher reli&s;h for &s;uch <HI>hallowed plea&s;ures,</HI> even than you, as I have had an op|portunity, which your purity may have denied you, of comparing tran&s;ient and libertine joys, with cha&s;te and &s;olid tran&s;ports. Some minutes now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ighs and &s;ilence, on both &s;ides, after which Mr. Andrews thus proceeded:</P>
<P>After tea was over, continued he, I offered to read to her, which &s;he accepted, and I cho&s;e to take up a play, as it afforded me opportunities, in the love &s;cenes, of addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf <HI>more
<PB N="123" REF="150">
per&s;onally</HI> to her, giving me pretences for &s;ome|times &s;eizing her hand, or catching her in my arms. She would oppo&s;e my tran&s;ports, and defend her&s;elf by &s;aying, that &s;he mu&s;t certainly acquit her&s;elf but aukwardly of a part, which &s;he had never even rehear&s;ed before. To which I replied, that love was a play, contrary to all others, where the be&s;t performers were tho&s;e who had practi&s;ed lea&s;t.</P>
<P>After this chearful and galant manner we con|ver&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed away the evening together, till I thought it time for my dear patient to re|tire to re&s;t. I then bowed and withdrew, cal|ling upon Mr. Beville in the parlour, to inform my&s;elf how to direct my cour&s;e to the <HI>lodge.</HI> I then retired back to the inn, got up early the next morning, and rode po&s;t to my friend's hou&s;e, about four miles beyond Hertford, where I arrived before dinner, the &s;ame day.</P>

<P>HE was rejoiced to &s;ee me, my plea|&s;ure was double. I was affected with a two-fold emotion, both of love and friend|&s;hip. I a&s;ked him a number of que&s;tions, about
<PB N="124" REF="151">
the nature of his farm, his intere&s;t in it, his oeconomy in the management of it, &amp;c. I que&s;tioned him after that vague and hurrying manner, in which people are apt to inquire about things they have no per&s;onal concern in, and received his an&s;wers with that inattention which is natural, when one's mind is occupied by re|flections that relate &s;olely to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After dinner we fell into a more &s;ettled and deliberate conver&s;ation. I gave him an account of my &s;cheme and conduct, &s;ince our la&s;t inter|view. I declared my pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter, but with that polite re&s;erve, that I did not afford the lea&s;t hint of my fond &s;u&s;picion about her reci|procal affection. I told him of my late vi&s;it to her at Wind&s;or, that I had urged my love and wi&s;hes, and had happily, though only in a tacit way, obtained her permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;peak more fully to him, upon that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed tran&s;ported at the overture, and acknowledged that he had perceived a growing pa&s;&s;ion in his &s;i&s;ter's brea&s;t, toward me, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and that this ob&s;ervation had rendered him a good deal unea&s;y, with regard to the &s;ituation of her mind; as it was certain that love always produces a more powerful effect in cha&s;te, than in di&s;&s;olute minds; for delicacy of &s;entiment, like the purene&s;s of gold, increa&s;es
<PB N="125" REF="152">
its weight, while vice, like alloy, renders it at once both light and fragile.</P>
<P>He concluded this reply, however, with this reflection, that though his mind had been now made ea&s;y with regard to that particular, he ap|prehended &s;ome difficulties in others, relating to our mutual &s;ecurity and happine&s;s, together. For my &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, has no fortune, and I am afraid that your father has as ridiculous a notion of <HI>knight errantry,</HI> as ever <HI>Cervantes</HI> had.</P>
<P>I replied, that this danger might be guarded again&s;t, for a time, by his being the only confi|dant in this affair, until I might be able to in|duce my father into a &s;ettlement, at lea&s;t <HI>po&s;t mortem,</HI> upon the merits of having provided for two of his family already, and at my own ex|pence too. But that if a di&s;covery &s;hould hap|pen to occur, before I might be fortunate enough to bring matters to a &s;afe cri&s;is, I did not apprehend that his re&s;entment would extend it|&s;elf beyond the pre&s;ent emotion; for that though his character was not, in &s;ome things, &s;uch as I could wi&s;h it, yet I hoped and believed that he had proper notions of ju&s;tice; for that his few fail|ings had always appeared to me to be rather faults of error, than of vice. Upon the whole, I concluded that if he would ri&s;que the hazard
<PB N="126" REF="153">
for his dear &s;i&s;ter, I would adventure it my&s;elf, for my &s;till dearer wife. We embraced, and &s;et out the next morning for Wind&s;or.</P>

<P>MR. Beville rode up directly to his father's hou&s;e, while I alighted at the inn, in order to &s;hift my dre&s;s to one more &s;eemly for a courtier, and as &s;oon as I was equipt I fol|lowed him. I found mi&s;s Beville in the parlour, with her mother and brother; I welcomed her down &s;tairs, and wi&s;hed the world joy of her returning into it again. She bowed, and Mrs. Beville replied, with a &s;mile, that &s;he wi&s;hed her dear Fanny had been a per&s;on of higher con&s;equence in it, for my &s;ake; that the fame of the patient's cure, might make the doctor's fortune. In a &s;hort time after, my friend led his mother out of the room, upon &s;ome pretence or other, whi&s;pering the&s;e words to me in French, as he pa&s;&s;ed by, <HI>L'amour, et l'occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>When we were thus left alone, I told her that I had waited on my friend, according to her permi&s;&s;ion, and had intirely explained away
<PB N="127" REF="154">
all ambiguity of expre&s;&s;ion, in my late addre&s;s toward her; and that, in return, he had given me leave to tender her, in more explicit terms, the future &s;ervices of my life; which I here, madam, in the fonde&s;t and mo&s;t earne&s;t man|ner, intreat you to accept of, added I, taking hold of her hand, and throwing my&s;elf at her feet.</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed me up with precipitation, ex|pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e charming words, at the &s;ame time, <HI>that thenceforth, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be not only her duty, but her practice al&s;o,</HI> which, while &s;he pronounced, a crim&s;on glow added a warmth and richne&s;s to her beauties, which in&s;pired me with the following reflection: <HI>How ill advi&s;ed are women who bani&s;h blu&s;hes from their cheeks! They are equally ornamental, to the &s;inner and to the &s;aint, and &s;upply tho&s;e advantages which either vanity or virtue would de&s;ire, at once both charm and awe, allure the lover, and rebuke the libertine.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant, a cri&s;is, when a polite lover and a delicate mi&s;tre&s;s wi&s;h equally to be re|lieved from each other, Mrs. Beville returned into the room, to &s;earch for &s;ome keys. I took advantage of this interruption, to retire, on pre|tence of &s;eeking out my friend and confidant, whom I found in his &s;tudy, employed as u&s;ual, in catching the flying moment to improve him|&s;elf
<PB N="128" REF="155">
in literature or morals. I acquainted him of my &s;ucce&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed my gratitude for his me|diation, and con&s;ulted with him upon proper mea&s;ures to perfect my happine&s;s, and to con|ceal it at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I dined at Mr. Beville's that day, and we &s;pent the remainder of it in conver&s;ation and read|ing. In the evening Beville took his &s;i&s;ter a&s;ide, to &s;ettle preliminaries, and appoint the day for our nuptials, which he told her it was nece&s;&s;ary for her&s;elf to do, as the expediency of keeping the affair a &s;ecret, for &s;ome time, left us not at liberty to communicate it even to her father or mother.</P>
<P>She replied that it would, by no means, be decent for a young woman to go upon &s;uch an errand as this, without the guardian&s;hip of &s;ome matron or other; and that &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary, which &s;he did in&s;i&s;t upon, that &s;ome per&s;on in that character, &s;hould be confided in, her duty and re&s;pect both, required that her dear mother &s;hould become the party. Beville mentioned this to me, I was highly plea&s;ed with her deli|cacy, and con&s;ented to the propo&s;ition. We then de&s;ired mi&s;s Beville to communicate the matter to her mother, who received the propo&s;al with joy, and in a few days I was rendered com|pleatly happy.</P>

<P>SOON after our marriage, my friend returned to the <HI>lodge,</HI> and invited his &s;i&s;ter home with him, on pretence of adju&s;ting the oeconomy of his little hou&s;hold, making an apology to his father and mother at the &s;ame time, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of his accommodation. I took a formal leave of the family, the &s;ame day, and returned to London, to examine into the &s;itua|tion of my affairs there, which finding ju&s;t in the &s;ame hopele&s;s &s;tate I had left them, I re|paired immediately to the <HI>lodge,</HI> &s;ummoned at once by love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In this charming retreat we &s;pent &s;ome months together, in the highe&s;t enjoyments of mortal bli&s;s; love, friend&s;hip, conver&s;ation, mu&s;ic, and letters. My dear Fanny was an excellent performer on the harp&s;ichord, and had a voice and ta&s;te &s;o very expre&s;&s;ive, that &s;he could al|mo&s;t turn &s;ound into &s;en&s;e; her brother played finely, on the fiddle, and I had been well prac|ti&s;ed on the violincello. What an harmony here, of &s;ound and &s;oul!</P>
<P>We &s;ecluded our&s;elves from all other &s;ociety at this place, except the mini&s;ter of our pari&s;h, who&s;e merit you &s;hall hear of; and were attended
<PB N="130" REF="157">
by <HI>dumb-waiters</HI> at our meals; &s;o that we might conver&s;e of books, without the imputation of pedantry, and philo&s;ophize, freely, without <HI>giving offence to weak minds;</HI> for '&s;quires were ex|cluded from our table, and &s;ervants from our &s;ide-board.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures I enjoyed in my new &s;tate of life, are not to be imagined but by one who has had the happine&s;s both to love, e&s;teem, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a woman of &s;en&s;e, beauty, and virtue. I was then &s;en&s;ible, for the fir&s;t time of my life; of a certain &s;olid and permanent joy; for the happine&s;s of marriage, like the intere&s;t of mo|ney, ari&s;es from a regular and e&s;tabli&s;hed fund; libertines &s;quander the <HI>principal,</HI> and &s;o become bankrupts.</P>
<P>I happened to rally my wife, one day, about her <HI>birth-day elegy,</HI> as I &s;tiled it; upon which &s;he &s;miled, and &s;aid, that &s;he had quite di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Melpomene</HI> from her toilette, and called down <HI>Thalia</HI> into her place; adding, that as there were to be none but her fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;elf by, (bow|ing to her brother and me) her third one being to quit the room, &s;he would communicate one of her hand-maid's handy works to us imme|diately. So &s;aying, &s;he took a paper out of her pocket, threw it on the table, and quick retired. For her mode&s;ty was not confined to cha&s;tity

alone, but formed the bloom and complexion of all the words and actions of her life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to enjoy the plea&s;ures of this dear &s;ociety without interruption, or alarming my father, I, &s;oon after our marriage, took a large farm in the neighbourhood, which I &s;et again in divi&s;ions, to a con&s;iderable advantage, re|&s;erving one of the inclo&s;ures in my own hands, to lay out my profit-rents upon. About the &s;ame time my friend took &s;ome other farms al&s;o, and obtained &s;everal agencies which enabled him to inlarge his hou&s;e, and encouraged his father to rent his employment at Wind&s;or, to a deputy, and remove with his wife and family, to &s;ettle at the <HI>lodge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="160">Soon after this, my father &s;ummoned me up to London, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in rai&s;ing my &s;i&s;ter's portion, who had lately received a propo&s;al from a gentleman of good fortune, in Surry. Our &s;ole capital &s;tock had been derived from my mother. It was a &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds, in the funds; but her father dying when &s;he was a child, her guardian and tru&s;tee had involved it in the intricacies of the law, by borrowing &s;ome money for his own u&s;e, upon it, before my mother had come of age.</P>
<P>From the time of my father's marriage, to this aera, the difficulty about proving the <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> had continued in chancery; which prevented his getting an ab&s;olute dominion over the prin|cipal, though the court had permitted him, all along, to receive the intere&s;t. And though his claim became finally a&s;certained in the preceding term, yet the time requi&s;ite to make up the de|cree, with &s;ome other common forms, or <HI>u&s;ual delays</HI> of law, obliged him to borrow the money, wanted upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This he had engaged from a banker in the city, who happened to be our former acquaint|ance, my dear Carewe, &s;aid he, and who, hav|ing conceived a good opinion of me, from my former tran&s;action with him, and which he re|lated to my father, in&s;i&s;ted upon my joining in
<PB N="134" REF="161">
the bond, as counter &s;ecurity. I readily con|curred; but when the deeds were brought to be &s;igned, I confe&s;s that I was both &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed to find that his old attorney was the per&s;on who was employed to tran&s;act this affair. I hinted it to the banker, and the an&s;wer he made me was, that the man was perfectly ac|quainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion, and that this article was all the concern he had with him. But as for morals, and all that &s;tuff, &s;aid he, 'tis a mere je&s;t, in things of this &s;ort, for attorneys will be true to their clients, for their own &s;ake, and what matter is it to us, how they play the rogue with all the world be&s;ides? Were we to enter into enquiries of this kind, added he, what would become of half the trade of London? A per&s;on may be a <HI>good man,</HI> on the Change, who is a very bad one, in his own hou&s;e. Whores and rogues mu&s;t live, concluded he, or the world would be too thinly peopled&mdash;I &s;igned the deeds, and returned to the country.</P>
<P>Mr. Beville and I gave our whole application toward the improvement of our farms, which was an exerci&s;e, both to body and mind, equally plea&s;ant and healthful. The con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;s, relieves the fatigues of labour, and the rich and various fruits of the earth, ripening one after another, pre&s;ent us &s;till with &s;omething

<P>WHILE Mr. Beville and I lived together at the <HI>lodge,</HI> we became acquainted with the clergyman of our pari&s;h, of whom I hinted to you before. He was a man of &s;en&s;e, learning, and humanity, a per&s;on of &s;trict mo|rals, and exemplary piety; but at the &s;ame time &s;o ea&s;y in his manners, and polite of addre&s;s, that all who conver&s;ed familiarly with him, would have taken him for a mere <HI>man of the world;</HI> the divine or philo&s;opher never appearing, but in his actions, or devotions. My Fanny &s;aid wittily of him one day, that he certainly did him&s;elf a &s;ort of <HI>inju&s;tice,</HI> by being &s;o <HI>agreeable,</HI> for that the love and e&s;teem which his worth alone had intitled him to the whole of, was by this means divided, and each merit thus de|frauded of half its due.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t appointment in the church, was to a+curacy of forty pounds a year, during which
<PB N="136" REF="163">
time, his &s;i&s;ter was left a dowerle&s;s widow, with a great number of unportioned children. He immediately fled to their relief, took a hou&s;e to accommodate this helple&s;s family, and opened a Latin &s;chool in the pari&s;h, in order to main|tain them.</P>
<P>While he was labouring under the&s;e difficul|ties, and life wa&s;ting away in celibacy, &s;ome of his friends propo&s;ed the &s;cheme of matrimony to him. But he declined it, &s;aying, that, till he had made provi&s;ion for his <HI>pre&s;ent children,</HI> he could neither think it ju&s;t, or prudent, to in|cumber him&s;elf with any <HI>future ones. "Why, man alive, the&s;e children are none of your own, &s;urely"</HI>&mdash;<Q>Not in a natural &s;en&s;e, indeed, an|&s;wered he, but in a <HI>moral</HI> one, I con&s;ider them in the &s;ame light. Children are the gift of Heaven, added he, and &s;ince Providence has thought proper to ccmmit the&s;e orphans to my charge, I will, like Jacob, endeavour to wre&s;t a ble&s;&s;ing from the &s;truggle, by &s;triving to perform the duty of a parent, toward them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Well, but doctor, are there not warm widows, or &s;nug old maids enough, in your pari&s;h, to feather your ne&s;t withal, and no danger of incumbering your&s;elf with a &s;econd brood, as you term it?</HI> <Q>But, gen|tlemen, &s;ometimes ladies, he would reply,

I will not mock the church's rites, and to marry, without a lover's wi&s;hes, or a father's hopes, is the ba&s;e&s;t pro&s;titution, &s;urely; nor would I gra&s;p another's wealth to enrich an alien.

<P>His virtue was applauded by all the <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> and afterwards rewarded, by a <HI>lay patron,</HI> who promoted him to the benefice of that pari&s;h, which is computed to be worth about five hun|dred pounds a year&mdash;Exactly the income of <HI>the man of Ro&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>HIS church was always crowded; for there was, in his manner of preaching, &s;ome|thing which caught the attention and fixed it, without either <HI>action, or grimace;</HI> &s;o that many pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;ermons u&s;ed to be remembered again, and quoted in conver&s;ation; and often urged as <HI>authorities,</HI> upon more &s;erious occa&s;ions. I &s;hall endeavour to recollect, &s;aid he, &s;ome of them which my Fanny u&s;ed to repeat, for your entertainment, and to make you, in &s;ome &s;ort, better acquainted with our worthy pa&s;tor:</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="165">The poor man's <HI>&s;crip,</HI> is the rich man's trea|&s;ury.</P>
<P>The perception of virtue is a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>If, among the que&s;tions of &s;chola&s;tic philo|&s;ophy, it &s;hould be a&s;ked, <HI>what is the &s;tronge&s;t thing, in nature?</HI> I &s;hould an&s;wer, <HI>Piety. It &s;ubdues this world, and wins the next.</HI></P>
<P>Religion is not a &s;toical habit of penance and &s;elf-denial, but a phy&s;ical regimen for plea&s;ure and &s;elf-enjoyment.</P>
<P>God is the <HI>&s;pring</HI> and <HI>ocean</HI> of our thoughts and actions. Every wi&s;h, every purpo&s;e, every deed, as they ari&s;e <HI>originally</HI> from him, &s;hould refer <HI>finally</HI> to him. Whatever de&s;ign, though ever &s;o virtuous, falls &s;hort of that great <HI>ulti|mate,</HI> unphilo&s;ophically makes the <HI>means</HI> the <HI>end</HI>&mdash;This reaches not up to true religion, but terminates in moral heatheni&s;m, only&mdash;</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of virtue upon the mere &s;core of intellectual plea&s;ure, has no more merit than the practice of temperance to give a ze&s;t to Epicu|ri&s;m. As neither of them make any part of the Chri&s;tian religion, they cannot be entitled to the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To rejoice at rain, <HI>without an acre of land;</HI> to redeem a debtor, <HI>remaining &s;till unknown;</HI> to quench the fire-brand in others haggart, <HI>with|out a boa&s;t;</HI> to wre&s;t the dagger from an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's

hand, <HI>and ne'er inform the victim;</HI> the &s;ecret tran&s;|port of &s;uch acts as the&s;e, can never be de&s;cribed equal to the feeling. In this &s;en&s;e alone, <HI>&s;tolen plea&s;ures are &s;weet,</HI> in any other, bitter.</P>
<P>There is a moral precept obligatory upon all mankind, <HI>to do good,</HI> as well as to <HI>ab&s;tain from evil.</HI> Suppo&s;e that all the world &s;hould refrain from ab&s;olute ill, and yet perform no po&s;itive good? in what &s;tate &s;hould we remain then? But, in reality, there can never be &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ed cir|cum&s;tance in &s;ociety, for the declining of actual virtue, is the incurring of negative guilt; <HI>Qui &s;uccurrere perituro pote&s;t, cum non &s;uccurrit, occidit;</HI> &s;ays Seneca, <HI>de beneficiis;</HI> but we have an higher authority, in &s;cripture, for, were not the <HI>prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>levite</HI> both cen&s;ured, for <HI>pa&s;&s;ing over on the other &s;ide,</HI> though they took no part with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins?</P>
<P>It was the opinion of the &s;toics, long before Chri&s;tianity, that all crimes were equal, and that an offence again&s;t any one moral, was the &s;ame with a breach of the whole ethic. Can philo&s;ophy then complain again&s;t the &s;everity of this text? <Q>He who is guilty of the breach of one part of the law, is guilty of the whole.</Q></P>
<P>Epictetus, in the 24th chapter, of the third book, has the&s;e remarkable words: <Q>My chil|dren's children will bear the puni&s;hment of

<P>THIS mo&s;t excellent per&s;on both orna|mented and enriched our little &s;ociety; and my dear Fanny, added he, with an heavy &s;igh, &s;eemed to receive a more particular &s;atis|faction, in his company and conver&s;ation. She &s;aid to me, one evening, ju&s;t after he had left us, <Q>How amiable is virtue, <HI>in the &s;acred cha|racter!</HI> Is it not remarkable that it &s;hould &s;trike us with an higher beauty here, where it mu&s;t be mo&s;t expected, than in any of the other conditions of life, where it might ap|pear more extraordinary? Is it perhaps, that in proportion as the deficiency of a character might offend, the perfection of it may plea&s;e? Is it not for this rea&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, that <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> is mo&s;t charming in woman, becau&s;e it is their peculiar characteri&s;tic? Is it that virtue &s;eems more immediately derived from heaven,
<PB N="141" REF="168">
in them&mdash;That in the clergy, it appears <HI>in|&s;piration;</HI> in the laiety, but <HI>in&s;truction, only?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>What an advantage, continued &s;he, mu&s;t &s;uch a pa&s;tor bring to morals and religion, in whom the pure&s;t virtue, and mo&s;t exemplary piety, are &s;hewn not to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the ea&s;ie&s;t manners of a gentleman? For it is the formality of par&s;ons, and the &s;tiffne&s;s of mere good men, which di&s;gu&s;t the world, and not their &s;trictne&s;s, or &s;anctity.</Q> All which &s;he concluded, with this ingenious allu|&s;ion, that as <HI>matter,</HI> indued only with its <HI>nece&s;|&s;ary properties,</HI> would be a <HI>lifele&s;s ma&s;s of unifor|mity;</HI> &s;o virtue without <HI>manners,</HI> would be as <HI>morally unamiable..</HI></P>
<P>The intervals of all the&s;e tran&s;actions which I have recited to you, are not at all material; and indeed, continued he, &s;ighing, Though I have dwelt long, with plea&s;ure, upon the former part of my relation, I &s;hall now make amends, by &s;hortening the &s;ad remainder of it, the prin|cipal event of which, I &s;hall comprehend in the exclamation of Brutus&mdash;<HI>Portia is dead!</HI></P>
<P>He attempted to pronounce this &s;entence in the &s;pirit of ancient philo&s;ophy; but he was no <HI>actor;</HI> and, few as the words were, his heart, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, failed him in the mid|dle of them. A torrent of fond and grateful

tears, gu&s;hed &s;uddenly to her memory, a gene|rous &s;ympathy affected Mr. Carewe, and Mr. Beville coming ju&s;t then, into the room, quick joined a brother's &s;orrow to an hu&s;band's grief.</P>

<P>MR. Carewe, in order to change the &s;ub|ject, and give a new turn to their thoughts, a&s;ked Mr. Beville what general news he had brought home from Scarborough, and what adventure had detained him &s;o much longer in town that day, than u&s;ual? He replied, that every thing of a public concern, was com|prehended in the London prints, which he took out of his pocket, and that he was delayed by taking leave of &s;ome friends of his, who were &s;etting out from Scarborough, for the York races, which had carried off mo&s;t of the com|pany out of town, and left the rooms extremely thin.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Carewe to Mr. Andrews, that you and I &s;hould accompany our friend, in his walk, to-morrow? It will &s;erve to &s;hift the &s;cene a little, and diver&s;ify our ideas. The emp|tine&s;s
<PB N="143" REF="170">
of the place, continued he, will be lucky enough for you, but, for my own part, I would be content to bear a little more <HI>crowding,</HI> for a little more company, to-morrow.</P>
<P>Why truly, I could be &s;atisfied with it, my|&s;elf too, replied Mr. Andrews, upon your ac|count; for I would &s;acrifice my own <HI>ea&s;e</HI> to a friend's <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> at any time. Nay, I will do more for you, added he, I will &s;acrifice even my <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> to yours al&s;o, by &s;etting you at liberty to go off to the races, to-morrow; and Mr. Beville, I hope, will be &s;o kind as to accompany you thither, for a few days, as I really think that both his health and mind require a little more exerci&s;e and amu&s;ement, than he takes, or can po&s;&s;ibly meet with, at the farm. Beville bowed a&s;&s;ent toward Carewe.</P>
<P>No, gentlemen, replied Mr. Carewe&mdash;But fir&s;t, let me thank ye both, for your politene&s;s, upon this occa&s;ion. However, as well as I love company, I would not ride thirty miles to &s;eek it in a crowd. Be&s;ides, your &s;entiments upon hor&s;e-racing, &s;aid he to Mr. Andrews, have much abated my reli&s;h for that &s;port, which I confe&s;s I was <HI>formerly</HI> very fond of; as, in truth, I was <HI>once,</HI> of every thing that had gaiety, &s;pirit, and hurry in it.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="171"><HI>Formerly,</HI> and <HI>once,</HI> upon a time, you &s;hould have added, my dear Carewe, replied Mr. An|drews, the&s;e are expre&s;&s;ions too antiquated to be uttered by a young, hand&s;ome fellow, of five and twenty. Oh! my dear friend, an|&s;wered Mr. Carewe, with a &s;igh, and gra&s;ping his hand, at the &s;ame time, you have loved&mdash; and mu&s;t therefore know that true pa&s;&s;ion ren|ders us philo&s;ophers to all other plea&s;ures, and an eunuch to every other de&s;ire.</P>

<P>THE next morning, Mr. Beville called upon his two friends, to take a walk with him to Scarborough, according to the purpo&s;e of the night before; but their &s;pirit for the frolic had &s;ub&s;ided in &s;leep, and they &s;uffered Mr. Beville to pur&s;ue his cour&s;e alone. After breakfa&s;t, Mr. Andrews led his friend to take a walk with him, along the &s;ea beach, and thus re-a&s;&s;umed his memoir.</P>
<P>I had brought my &s;tory to a &s;hort period, ye&s;terday morning, continued Mr. Andrews, for two rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t, becau&s;e it gave me pain to dwell, for any time, upon a circum|&s;tance, that whatever has already, or may here|after befal me, of lo&s;s, or &s;orrow, I may venture to &s;tile, by way of eminence, the only misfor|tune of my life. And next, that as I had turned toward the window, to hide my eyes from from yours, I perceived Mr. Beville coming up the avenue, and I would &s;pare his grief, as well as my own.</P>
<P>But as there remain &s;ome particulars yet to be mentioned, to compleat my own hi&s;tory, I &s;hall relate the la&s;t article again, more at large, during
<PB N="146" REF="173">
our pre&s;ent lei&s;ure, and the &s;orrows which it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily renew, will, in &s;ome &s;ort, be relieved by the pride and plea&s;ure I &s;hall at once receive, in letting you a little farther into the beauty and delicacy of that amiable woman, my lo&s;t Fanny's character.</P>
<P>Our marriage had been kept &s;till a &s;ecret from her father, till my wife had become with child; and, as he then lived in the hou&s;e with us, it was not po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t my nicety about her &s;ame rendered it improper, to make a my&s;tery of it to him, any longer; and he was therefore, admitted to be a member of our privy-council. He received the news but coolly; he was natu|rally warm and proud; he, at fir&s;t, re&s;ented his not having been made a confidant, from the beginning; and then &s;eemed mortified at the nece&s;&s;ity his daughter was reduced to, of carry|ing on a clande&s;tine commerce, to the hazard of her reputation, and the humiliation of his own pride.</P>
<P>He had a precipitate manner of re&s;olving, and acting. He took his re&s;olution on the in&s;tant, and, without communicating his de&s;ign, wrote a letter, that very evening, to my father, in|forming him of our marriage, &s;aying, that he had been a perfect &s;tranger to it him&s;elf, until a few hours before; adding, that he had already
<PB N="147" REF="174">
pardoned the breach of duty, on his daughter's part, hoping that he might do the &s;ame on his &s;on's; and concluded his letter with &s;aying, that he would readily join his intere&s;t with my fa|ther's, to compa&s;s &s;ome preferment, or civil em|ploy for me, to make amends for his daughter's want of fortune; which he, with ju&s;tice indeed, affirmed to be the only merit in which &s;he could be deemed deficient.</P>
<P>To this indi&s;creet epi&s;tle he received no an|&s;wer, but I did. My father inclo&s;ed it back again to me, with a few lines in the cover, de|claring that he had that day made and perfected his will; and had cut me intirely out from all chance of inheritance, for ever, of any part of his pre&s;ent, or future fortunes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="52" TYPE="chapter">

<P>I happened to be at my farm, when the po&s;t came in, and as I had always indulged my deare&s;t Fanny in the amu&s;ement of opening my letters, in my ab&s;ence, &s;he had the unhappine&s;s of receiving this &s;hock, which I would have &s;aved her from as long as it might have been in
<PB N="148" REF="175">
my power, if the letter had fallen fir&s;t into my hands.</P>
<P>When I returned to the lodge, that day, I perceived a remarkable alteration in her coun|tenance, though &s;he received me with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s as u&s;ual. I appeared alarmed, and taking her fondly by the hand, a&s;ked her, with &s;ome emotion, whether &s;he had been taken ill, during my ab&s;ence. The &s;oftne&s;s of my man|ners affected her, &s;he fell into tears, and took the letters out of her pocket. I read them ha&s;tily over, and after making this &s;hort reflection, that the indi&s;cretion of a friend, may &s;ometimes do one as much mi&s;chief as the malice of an enemy, I caught her eagerly in my arms, cry|ing out with hope and fondne&s;s, <HI>that Heaven had, for virtue, more fathers than one.</HI></P>
<P>We then agreed not to mention any thing of this affair, to her father or mother, in order to pre&s;erve peace and harmony at home. Her bro|ther had been accidentally made acquainted with it before, as he happened to be by when &s;he opened the letters, and &s;natched them up as they fell from her trembling hand. I endea|voured to re-a&s;&s;ure her &s;pirits, for the pre&s;ent, by this philo&s;ophical reflection, that as I had long de&s;paired of any manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from my father, during his life, it was too &s;oon to
<PB N="149" REF="176">
grieve, till we &s;hould fir&s;t feel the effects of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Such turns of thought as this, have frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to parry, or po&s;tpone &s;everal unea|&s;ine&s;&s;es in life; but my dear Fanny had not the lea&s;t particle of &s;toici&s;m in all her compo&s;ition. She was all delicacy, feeling, and &s;entiment. This event therefore, preyed con&s;tantly on her &s;pirits, and, finally, affected her health; and mine al&s;o, in a great mea&s;ure, along with it. For though I am an excellent philo&s;opher, <HI>for my&s;elf,</HI> I am the wor&s;t in the world, <HI>for another.</HI> My mind; indeed, is ma&s;culine, but my heart of the true feminine gender. My &s;ympathy is &s;tronger than my nerves, and I feel misfortunes, as one does heat, weak in the <HI>direct line,</HI> but forcibly from <HI>reflection.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="53" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LIII.</HEAD>
<P>SHE laboured under a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, till &s;he delivered a &s;on to my arms, and then fell into a fever; from which, however, &s;he recovered, but with &s;o &s;low a progre&s;s, that I was alarmed about her declining into a decay;
<PB N="150" REF="177">
and, to increa&s;e the danger of which, her fond mother, her fir&s;t connection in life, both of duty and affection, expired in her arms, of a di&s;order &s;he had contracted by her con&s;tant watchings, and a&s;&s;iduous attendance upon her beloved child, during the cour&s;e of her late and pre&s;ent illne&s;s.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Beville, the father, re|ceived an account from Wind&s;or, that his de|puty had failed, and imbezzled his revenues; which obliged him to return, and try what mea|&s;ures he could pur&s;ue, in order to vindicate his right, and recover his employ again. My wife remained with her brother, who &s;pared no man|ner of expence, in phy&s;icians or medicine, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of her health; while I did every thing, on my part, that tenderne&s;s, love and duty could &s;ugge&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her remedies, and expedite her cure. For, oh! I loved her, to the la&s;t moment of her exi&s;tence, with tenfold the ardour with which I fir&s;t received her virgin &s;acrifice to my longing arms. For where true virtuous pa&s;&s;ion is, the torch of Hymen but <HI>&s;inges</HI> the wings of Cupid, and <HI>anneals</HI> his ar|rows.</P>
<P>Our difficulties were, &s;oon after, con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, by the falling away of Beville's agen|cies, one after another, by minors coming of
<PB N="151" REF="178">
age, and others, for whom he was employed, returning from abroad, to re&s;ide upon their own e&s;tates; while, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;treights, and gloomy pro&s;pects, my family was increa&s;ed by the birth of a daughter; which threw the dear mother back again into her former weak|ne&s;s, from which &s;he had, for &s;ome little time, appeared to be tolerably well recovered.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this interval, her aunt, by the mother's &s;ide, became a widow, with a good jointure. She had been made acquainted with our mar|riage, as &s;oon as the veil of &s;ecrecy had been withdrawn; and as &s;he lived within twenty miles of our re&s;idence, we had had frequent in|tercour&s;e of vi&s;its, while my dear wife was able to ride abroad.</P>
<P>Soon after her hu&s;band's death, I waited upon her to pay my compliments of condolance; and, on my informing her of our apprehen&s;ions about her niece's relap&s;e and danger, &s;he very kindly offered to carry her with her to Spa, whither &s;he was advi&s;ed to repair immediately, on account of her daughter, and only child, a very hand&s;ome young woman, about twenty years of age, who had been, for &s;ome time, in a very precarious &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my thanks, in the mo&s;t grateful and affectionate manner, and returned directly
<PB N="152" REF="179">
to the lodge, to acquaint my dear wife of this kind and opportune invitation. She, at fir&s;t, declined accepting of it, but, after &s;ome reluc|tance, and her being informed by her phy&s;icians, that tho&s;e waters were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to|ward the recovery of her health, with a religious exhortation too, upon this &s;ubject, from her favourite divine, &s;he was at length prevailed upon, to prepare for her journey.</P>
<P>In a few days after, her aunt and cou&s;in cal|led upon her&mdash;I put her into the coach&mdash;I &s;aw her then, for the la&s;t time!</P>

<P>I Returned to her apartment, threw my&s;elf on the bed, and felt infinitely more wretched than at any interval of my confinement in the <HI>compter;</HI> for now, I had <HI>her life</HI> to fear for. As my eyes wandered about the room, I perceived a manu&s;cript paper lying on her table, which, apprehending to be &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary memoran|dums &s;he had forgot to take with her, I ha&s;tily aro&s;e, read, ki&s;&s;ed, and wept over the following lines:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">

<HEAD>A Soliloquy.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been the child of &s;orrow, or of care, e'er &s;ince my fir&s;t reflection's dawn. My heart was early taught to melt at other's woe, by feelings of its own. In my fir&s;t &s;pring of youth, I &s;ought for wi&s;dom, and dulled the ro&s;eate bloom upon my cheek, by &s;earching for her &s;acred lore. The midnight taper oft has been extingui&s;hed by the radiant &s;un, which found my &s;leeple&s;s eyes unwearied.</P>
<P>Yet then did vanity intrude, and youthful &s;pirits mounting to my heart, whi&s;pered that all this philo&s;ophic pride was fruitle&s;s, the <HI>means</HI> were plea&s;ant, but the <HI>end</HI> was endle&s;s; and that in love alone, was happine&s;s &s;upreme. The trial &s;oon was made&mdash;I loved, and was beloved again. But, oh! what angui&s;h did that pa&s;&s;ion co&s;t my timerous heart! Fear entered with it, and held the alternate empire of my brea&s;t, for many a tedious day. Without the latter, how un&s;afe the fir&s;t; and with it, what a &s;lavery to &s;u&s;tain!</P>
<P>At length, what can be found of happine&s;s in love, was mine. The object of my choice, with generous tenderne&s;s and reciprocal flame, approved me his, and left me no ambition.
<PB N="154" REF="181">
Sorrow and fear now vani&s;hed for a while, but to return with allied &s;trength. Attended by pale poverty they came, and, to extend their cruel power, have with a double barbed arrow pierced me. For on their iron darts are graved the tender names of hu&s;band, and of children!</P>
<P>How then can I defend my un&s;hielded heart, or vindicate the empire of my &s;oul, when the&s;e dear ties, the neare&s;t and the be&s;t, give added force to every wound, and ri&s;e auxiliaries again&s;t me! Yet &s;ure there is a &s;trength, &s;uperior &s;till to theirs, and, oh! endow me with it, Heaven! A re&s;ignation to thy all-wi&s;e decrees, a calm de|pendance on thy paternal providence, and grace to &s;ay, <HI>Thy will, my God, not mine, be done.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P>There was &s;omething in this charming young man's di&s;tre&s;s, that had a noblene&s;s, a genero|&s;ity, a virtue in it, which, in my opinion, mu&s;t intere&s;t the mind, even more than the misfor|tunes of either Mr. Andrews, or Mr. Beville.

<P>The next morning every thing went on, as u&s;ual, Mr. Beville walked away to Scarborough, the two other friends retired them&s;elves after breakfa&s;t, into the library, and Mr. Andrews thus pur&s;ued his adventures, in context with tho&s;e of Mr. Beville.</P>

<P>ABOUT a year before this event, my wor|thy friend, Mr. Beville, who, though a reading and contemplative man, had a great &s;pirit for adventure, had engaged him&s;elf in a certain manufacture; in order to carry on which, with effect, it was nece&s;&s;ary to borrow a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money; and for which purpo&s;e I recommended him to our old banker, before mentioned, my dear Carewe; who, in order to judge of his &s;ecurity, &s;ent his <HI>&s;ame</HI> attorney down into the country, who &s;taid a week with us, to inquire into the circum&s;tances of Mr. Beville's fortune, the intere&s;t of his farms, the nature and progre&s;s of the manufacture, with the re&s;pon&s;i|bility of his character. About all which parti|culars having received &s;ufficient &s;atisfaction, he drew up the deeds, paid the money for his client, and returned back to London.</P>
<P>While he remained with us in the country, he appeared extremely plea&s;ed with all the im|provements made both upon Mr. Beville's farms, and mine; but &s;aid that it was a pity they were not held jointly, by the &s;ame tenant; for as one was moi&s;t, and the other dry, they would yield
<PB N="161" REF="188">
a double profit and convenience together, to the value of both, &s;eparately occupied.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to be charmed with the &s;ituation of the lodge, the gardens, orchards, fi&s;h-ponds, and the accommodation of his offices; and &s;aid, that it would be an happy &s;cene of retirement, for any wearied citizen, from the hurry and bu&s;tle of a town, there to pa&s;s, in peace, and re|ligion, the remainder of his days; rejoicing in the fruits of hone&s;t indu&s;try, and enjoying the fulne&s;s of a well-earned fortune.</P>
<P>Some time after my dear wife had gone off to Spa, leaving her brother and me in the highe&s;t of human afflictions, de&s;pairing, from the many &s;ymptoms of her di&s;order, with &s;ome dark ex|pre&s;&s;ions dropt by her phy&s;icians, of ever &s;eeing a per&s;on return to us, again, whom we &s;o ten|derly loved, and &s;o de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed; we received a private intimation, one day, from the &s;heriff of our county, that executions again&s;t our bodies, goods, and lands, had been lodged in his office, that morning, by the banker's at|torney, afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>We then, both of us, too late, perceived the unguarded weakne&s;s of putting our&s;elves, or for|tunes, into the power of a per&s;on who lay under the dangerous, and wicked influence of one, who&s;e malice and revenge, we had rea&s;on to
<PB N="162" REF="189">
apprehend, might have in&s;tigated his avarice and extortion, to injure and oppre&s;s us. But we &s;oon exchanged reflection for action, having but ju&s;t time enough to &s;ecure our per&s;ons from ar|re&s;t, by flying up to London, together, with what bills and ca&s;h we could mu&s;ter up between us, at that time, and of which we made one common pur&s;e, amounting to about an hun|dred pounds.</P>

<P>AFTER the&s;e di&s;appointments, I wrote to the principal tenant on my own farm, to come up to town, and give us an account of the tran&s;actions which had pa&s;&s;ed in the country, with regard to our unhappy affairs. He was an intelligent per&s;on, and had attended the &s;heriff's &s;ale, both of poor Beville's effects, and mine. He told us that every thing had gone off, at a third or fourth of their value, as they always do upon &s;uch unhappy occa&s;ions; except my wife's picture, and mine, which, having been bid for, by our hone&s;t friend the clergyman, dropping &s;ome indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ions of regard, at the &s;ame time, were rai&s;ed upon him to a con&s;iderable price, by the attorney, who was pre&s;ent at the &s;ale, and took the hint from his earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>He then added a large encomium upon our friend, and concluded with an expre&s;&s;ion, the

&s;implicity of which forced a &s;mile from both Beville, and me, even in the mid&s;t of our di|&s;tre&s;s, that the doctor was certainly a <HI>primitive Chri&s;tian, if ever there was one.</HI> He told us al&s;o, that the attorney had purcha&s;ed the intere&s;ts of both our farms, at a very trifing value; as the &s;ub-&s;heriff immediately declared the &s;ale, as &s;oon as he began to bid for them.</P>
<P>I &s;ettled accounts with this man, for his rent, and the ballance in my favour, which was forty pounds, I directed him to pay into the hands of his worthy pa&s;tor, to whom I al&s;o wrote a letter of thanks, begging him to keep that depo&s;it in his hands, to defray the current expences of my dear children's nur&s;ing, who were rearing in his pari&s;h.

<P>POOR Beville, continued Mr. Andrews, re&s;trained his &s;orrow, and did every thing in the power of good &s;en&s;e, religion, and friend|&s;hip, to &s;trengthen my mind, and &s;upport my &s;pirits under our mutual calamity; while I, in tenderne&s;s to him, u&s;ed to turn a&s;ide to mourn, and endeavour to conceal a woman's heart, un|der a &s;toic's ma&s;k. And this generous attention toward each other's grief, was of more real &s;er|vice to us both, than all the bravery of philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>But, one day, after I had brought my&s;elf to|lerably well, to the pre&s;erving of appearances, at lea&s;t, an unlucky incident happened to occur, which occa&s;ioned me to relap&s;e again, into all my former <HI>indecencies.</HI> After dinner Mr. Beville drank off a gla&s;s of wine to my health, and taking me by the hand, at the &s;ame time, Dear <HI>brother,</HI> &s;aid he, this is your <HI>birth-day.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion conjured up, almo&s;t to view, my blu&s;hing Fanny, in her bridal robes, and the la&s;t brought in&s;tantly to my mind, that triumphant, that tran&s;porting &s;cene, which I had exulted in at Wind&s;or, upon &s;uch another aera.

every interval of bli&s;s, till the la&s;t fatal clo&s;e. My &s;pirits were hurried on too fa&s;t, I grew &s;ick, my manhood failed me, I fainted &s;uddenly into my friend's arms.</P>
<P>When he had recovered me to &s;en&s;e again, I ju&s;t hinted to him, without daring to dwell upon it, the groupe of thoughts which had overpowered me. He lamented his expre&s;&s;ion, though innocent, and we pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the evening together, in mutual &s;ilence, &s;ighs, and tears.</P>
<P>We immediately removed the wine, after my emotion, being both of us of opinion, as well from our own experience, as from a general ob|&s;ervation upon others, that there never was a more fallacious maxim, than that which has been too often impo&s;ed upon the already too unhappy, that wine is &s;erviceable to bani&s;h care. When the body is oppre&s;&s;ed by fatigue, &s;ickne&s;s, or pain, high cordials may relieve, or a&s;&s;wage; but where the mind has caught the infection, water is our &s;afe&s;t potion. Wine but augments the di&s;po&s;ition it encounters; &s;inks dulne&s;s into &s;tupidity, rai&s;es mirth into madne&s;s, and aggra|vates melancholy to de&s;pair.</P>

<P>I could not clo&s;e my eyes, all night, and the next morning I found my&s;elf in an high fever. I continued ill for about three weeks, ten days of which my life was de&s;paired of. During the whole time Mr. Beville lay on a pallet, by my bed-&s;ide; and our worthy friend the clergyman, upon receiving an account of my danger, by a letter from Mr. Beville, came up immediately to London, and &s;taid in town till I was quite recovered; vi&s;iting, praying, and reading by me, every day.</P>
<P>How often, and how ardently, my dear Ca|rewe, continued he, have both Mr. Beville and I wi&s;hed for the high relief of your friendly con|ver&s;e, during our confinement here! But I knew not where to enquire for you, nor dared I ven|ture abroad, to &s;earch for you in coffee-hou&s;es, or on the public walks.</P>
<P>And this re&s;traint was perhaps not the lea&s;t part of my difficulties in this &s;ituation; for &s;o great is my love of liberty, that though I &s;eldom &s;tir from home, and u&s;ually, through choice, pa&s;s mo&s;t part of my time in my &s;tudy, I believe
<PB N="175" REF="202">
that there are few per&s;ons alive, who can brook <HI>impo&s;ed</HI> confinement, le&s;s than I could.</P>

<P>THE clergyman remained in town for a few days after my recovery; he had taken a lodging near ours, and &s;pent mo&s;t part of his time with us. Among other &s;ubjects of conver|&s;ation, happening to &s;peak about our late misfor|tune in the country, he told Mr. Beville that, as is generally the way, <HI>a few</HI> pitied his di&s;tre&s;s, but <HI>many</HI> blamed his conduct; for with man|kind, &s;aid he, it is <HI>crime</HI> enough to be <HI>unfortu|nate;</HI> and, in your pre&s;ent unhappy circum|&s;tances, cen&s;ure has pur&s;ued you, even for <HI>me|rits,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>un&s;ucce&s;sful.</HI></P>
<P>This is by no means uncommon, replied Be|ville, for the world, like women, never pardon an attempt&mdash;<HI>if you fail</HI>&mdash;But prithee, dear Sir, &s;aid he, what are the charges produced again&s;t me, and in what particulars is my conduct re|proached in the country?</P>
<P>Why, in the fir&s;t place, an&s;wered the clergy|man, that you turned your mind to extravagant <HI>projects, animum habuit &s;emper ingentia, &s;emper in|finita expetentem.</HI> Secondly, that you had once an opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing your fortunes, by
<PB N="176" REF="203">
the <HI>management,</HI> as they term it, of &s;even or eight thou&s;and pounds a year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His agencies.</NOTE>, and yet have <HI>no|thing to &s;hew for it,</HI> as is the expre&s;&s;ion. And la&s;tly, that you have lived above your fortune, till you finally ruined it.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>indictments,</HI> replied Mr. Beville, I hope it will be accepted as a &s;uf|ficient <HI>plea,</HI> that as I never had patrimony, pro|fe&s;&s;ion, trade, or employ, my life, of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t have been a life of <HI>adventure. Project, or &s;tarve,</HI> was certainly, in this ca&s;e, my motto. In &s;uch a &s;ituation as mine, <HI>to live,</HI> it&s;elf, re|quired <HI>a &s;cheme&mdash;Nece&s;&s;itas ante rationem.</HI> For life hath long &s;ince cea&s;ed to be a <HI>&s;ine-cure</HI>&mdash;Spon|taneous fruits ri&s;e not, at pre&s;ent, from the earth, as in <HI>The Garden;</HI> nor does manna now drop from the heavens, as in <HI>The Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd charge, I do con|fe&s;s that I have known many per&s;ons <HI>thrive,</HI> for|give the expre&s;&s;ion here, upon far le&s;s advan|tages; who have rai&s;ed fortunes, by purcha&s;ing &s;ome their <HI>neighbour</HI>'s, &s;ome their <HI>employer</HI>'s e&s;tates, and &s;prung from dung-carts into a coach and &s;ix. All this indeed, I know to be true&mdash;I had like to have &s;aid <HI>too true</HI>&mdash;Too true, alas! for them&s;elves, I fear.</P>
<P>To take advantage of one man's misfortunes, to over-reach another's weakne&s;s,

<L>To wring</L>
<L>From the hard hand of pea&s;ants, their vile tra&s;h,</L>

were arts my pride di&s;dained, my moral &s;tarted at. I have a &s;ympathy in my nature, which, like the cameleon's hue, catches the complexion of occurring objects&mdash;I rejoice, and mourn for feelings not my own&mdash;What &s;hould I gain then by another's di&s;tre&s;s, when by augmenting his I mu&s;t increa&s;e my own! With what a ravening hunger mu&s;t that wretch be &s;eized, who eats one mor&s;el in another's wrong! I &s;hould deem my|&s;elf unhappy to have inherited a fortune, &s;o dearly earned&mdash;How much more wretched then, to be the guilty purcha&s;er! Yet much I fear, there are, who could revel in a &s;acked city, and reckon plunder among the goods of fortune!</P>
<P>The la&s;t objection, &s;aid he, I need give but a &s;hort an&s;wer to&mdash;It has been urged, that I have lived above <HI>my fortune</HI>&mdash;But in reality, I never did, I never could do &s;o. I never had any&mdash;I have, therefore, only lived above <HI>no fortune,</HI> which the mo&s;t thrifty per&s;on alive mu&s;t do, in like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I entered the world&mdash;I mu&s;t repeat it&mdash;with|out patrimony, profe&s;&s;ion, trade, or emyloy; I have unportioned, and unpen&s;ioned, main|tained
<PB N="178" REF="205">
the po&s;t and character of a gentleman, ever &s;ince I have entered into life; and, had I not experienced the mi&s;er's gripe, had I not felt oppre&s;&s;ion's weight, I could now walk un|captioned on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> with a thou&s;and pounds in my pocket. Let any man fir&s;t &s;hew a better oeconomy, and he &s;hall then be free to cen&s;ure mine.</P>
<P>I cannot chu&s;e my life, continued he, all that re&s;ts upon me is to make the be&s;t of it, as it occurs. My de&s;ires are rea&s;onable&mdash;above de|pendance, but below ambition, and I de&s;pair not of Providence. Should even this whole world fail me, my hopes remain unabated &s;till, nay ri&s;e in mea&s;ure to my di&s;appointments here. The bu&s;ine&s;s of life is &s;o to live, as not to fear to die.

<P>MR. Carewe appeared charmed with the &s;pirit and virtue of Mr. Beville's ju&s;tifi|cation, and acknowledged to Mr. Andrews, that the generous warmth, with which that gentle|man
<PB N="179" REF="206">
had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, upon this occa&s;ion, had &s;tampt an higher character for him, in his mind, than any thing he had yet &s;een, or heard of him, till then, had been able to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>In fine, &s;aid he, I think that both he and you have revived the credit of the antient philo&s;ophy, and re&s;tored to poverty its former dignity, in your &s;ingle and &s;ingular characters. <HI>Regum aequa|bat opes animis.</HI> I wi&s;h you could al&s;o, added he, bring back the golden patronage as happily, that &s;ome Pollio, or Macaenas, might &s;eek you out amid&s;t &s;eque&s;tered groves, and
<Q>"Beckon mode&s;t merit from the &s;hade."</Q>
In the mean time, as Pliny &s;ays, <HI>E&s;t quidam vera felicitas, felicitate dignum videri.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Andrews bowed, and returned him equal thanks for his encomiums both upon his friend, and him&s;elf; and then replied, that he had ne|ver con&s;idered poverty in the abject light that the world is too apt to do. There are two &s;orts of pride, &s;aid he, with regard to this point. One, the antient and philo&s;ophie &s;pirit, which cho&s;e, and gloried in it; the other, the mo|dern, and beggarly one, that avoids, and is a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>But poverty, in it&s;elf, is &s;o far from being mean, that it requires certain accidents, to ren|der
<PB N="180" REF="207">
it &s;o. Ignoble birth, &s;ervile office, low con|de&s;cen&s;ions, vulgar manners, di&s;hone&s;t actions, or poorne&s;s of &s;pirit. Any of the&s;e particulars, indeed, may deba&s;e poverty to meanne&s;s; but will they not, at the &s;ame time, dimini&s;h the grandeur of riches?</P>
<P>Poverty, continued he, hurts our credit, only on the <HI>Change,</HI> yet even there, character alone, has rai&s;ed a fortune; but con&s;idered &s;ingly, ex|cludes us not from a <HI>court.</HI> The opulence of Plato enriched not his philo&s;ophy, but the indi|gence of Socrates has reflected a lu&s;tre upon his. Is there then a &s;oul &s;o poor, as not to prefer a pedigree from the latter, to the whole lineage of Attalus?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Mr. Andrews had fini&s;hed this expre&s;|&s;ion, Mr. Beville and the children came rioting into the room, to acquaint them that dinner was on the table. They pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of this day more chearfully together, than any of the former, except a &s;igh or furtive tear, which would often e&s;cape involuntarily from Andrews, and &s;ometimes from Beville, al&s;o.</P>

<P>HERE give me leave, Mr. Reader, to offer you a further proof of the authen|ticity of the&s;e memoirs, from an ob&s;ervation I &s;hall make upon &s;ome parts of the two preceding chapters. And fir&s;t, there is a very obvious <HI>per&s;onality,</HI> perceivable in the warmth, feeling, and lively re&s;entment, which Mr. Beville has expre&s;&s;ed in his defence, &s;o different from the natural coldne&s;s of <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> that mu&s;t cer|tainly, to a critic, manife&s;t &s;ome real and pecu|liar adaption in it, and &s;ufficiently evince the&s;e writings to be genuine.</P>
<P>But the particular which mo&s;t eminently points out the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of this whole per|formance, is the high encomiums which Mr. Carewe be&s;tows upon the characters of both Mr. Andrews, and Mr. Beville. Suppo&s;ing this triumvirate to be three real, and di&s;tinct per&s;ons, &s;uch politene&s;s might very fairly have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween ingenious per&s;ons, and friends; but, upon the hypothe&s;is of its being merely a novel, where every thing that is &s;aid, in what&s;oever character, is to be directly imputed to the au|thor, &s;uch <HI>&s;elf-applau&s;e,</HI> admi&s;&s;ible in no ca&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="209">
whatever, except the te&s;timony of a clear con|&s;cience, would certainly be mo&s;t abominable.</P>
<P>For though the commendatory ver&s;es, which one often &s;ees prefixed to the works of &s;everal modern writers, &s;eem to &s;avour a good deal of this vanity, yet &s;till they are but the compli|ments of others, <HI>though publi&s;hed by them&s;elves.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s eulogies, which &s;ome of the antients have left us of their own works, as the

<OPENER><SALUTE>Old Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MAY well call you &s;o, for it really &s;eems an age, &s;ince we parted. I never forgot you, however, but thought of you as often as I could of any thing, in the di&s;&s;ipated kind of life I have ever &s;ince led. It was what you would have &s;tiled perfect <HI>&s;quirely.</HI></P>
<P>But I have lately taken one thought into my head, that will probably la&s;t for life; and am very bu&s;y, at pre&s;ent, in collecting my &s;cattered affections together, to place them all upon a &s;ingle object.</P>
<P>In fine, I am to be married, without reprieve, on the tenth day of next month; and, as it is u&s;ual for the deare&s;t connections to attend the departure of a friend, I intreat the favour of your flying to me directly, on the receipt of this &s;ummons, to accompany me at my approaching execution.</P>

On the receipt of this letter, my former fondne&s;s for him began to revive, I needed exerci&s;e and amu&s;ement, my&s;elf, in my then weak and &s;oli|tary &s;tate, and was al&s;o plea&s;ed at an opportunity of relea&s;ing poor Mr. Beville from his heavy confinement.

&s;et out together, in about a week after the re|ceipt of this letter.</P>

<P>HE received us with his u&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s, and &s;eemed particularly plea&s;ed to &s;ee me. His character ran through his whole oeconomy. His living was extempore. A market, at &s;ix miles di&s;tance, &s;upplied him with every thing in his hou&s;e, and his deme&s;ne was over-run with deer and hor&s;es. Within, all hurry, and no order; and without, a number of improvements begun, but nothing fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>For his way was, whenever he re&s;olved upon any thing, he immediately commenced it; and, if any other whim came into his head, before he had compleated the fir&s;t, he took off his <HI>hands,</HI> directly, to enter upon that al&s;o, for fear he &s;hould forget it. So that his whole deme&s;ne was but a confu&s;ed heap of <HI>memorandums,</HI> and might not improperly be &s;tiled <HI>Notes for improve|ments.</HI></P>
<P>Before his hou&s;e was laid out a <HI>mile</HI> avenue, of <HI>fifty yards</HI> long; behind it, a <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> with
<PB N="187" REF="214">
<HI>an hog&s;head of water</HI> in it; on one &s;ide, was an obeli&s;k, three feet high; and on the other, a <HI>rialto,</HI> of <HI>half an arch.</HI> His garden was but half inclo&s;ed, in one corner of which &s;tood the <HI>four &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> huddled together in <HI>a groupe,</HI> as in the <HI>chaos;</HI> and in the mid&s;t of them were &s;een <HI>time,</HI> and a <HI>&s;un-dial,</HI> lying <HI>in wait</HI> for their pede&s;tals.</P>
<P>I found my friend much impaired &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw him, both in his looks, health, and man|ners. His face was emaciated, his hand &s;hook, and in&s;tead of that free, di&s;engaged air, which u&s;ed to give the grace of youth and fa&s;hion to all his words, and actions, he had contracted a &s;tiffne&s;s in his ge&s;ture, a con&s;traint in his addre&s;s, and a certain <HI>mediocrit&eacute;</HI> throughout his whole ap|pearance.</P>
<P>I e&s;&s;ayed him a little, upon literary topics, but he &s;oon cut me &s;hort, by acknowledging that he had not read one <HI>crabbed line,</HI> as he termed it, ever &s;ince we had parted. And why, after all, &s;aid he, &s;hould we idle away our time, after the concerns of the <HI>pa&s;t world,</HI> when <HI>the pre&s;ent</HI> &s;upplies us with &s;ufficient occupation, for our whole lives? I perfectly agree with you, my dear friend, replied I, that the <HI>current world</HI> may very wi&s;ely employ the full mea&s;ure of our time, provided that we con&s;ider it, <HI>not as a di&s;tinct interval, but as a commencement of the next.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="215">I know, <HI>doctor,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;miling on me, that theological philo&s;ophy is always for <HI>blending of &s;y&s;tems;</HI> but I hope that I do not &s;eparate the&s;e two, my&s;elf, when I declare that I take the whole duty of man, both ab&s;olutely and rela|tively con&s;idered, to con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e three things: Fear God, honour the king, and pay twenty &s;hillings in the pound. Which, in my opinion, added he, fully comprehend the &s;cope of all our religious, civil, and moral obligations.</P>
<P>Beville and I &s;trolled into his &s;tudy, the morn|ing after our arrival, and took a &s;urvey of his books. They were but few. About a dozen volumes of plays, novels, and mi&s;cellanies, Bolton's Ju&s;tice, with Hobbe's, Wool&s;ton's, Tindal's, and Chubb's works, Shaft&s;bury's Cha|racteri&s;tics, and Bolingbroke's philo&s;ophical wri|tings, compo&s;ed his whole library.</P>
<P>At length the nuptial morn arrived. Our friend dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the gaye&s;t manner, for the occa&s;ion, and we all took coach together, to wait upon the bride&mdash;To commence that fa|tal cour&s;e of the &s;upreme&s;t bli&s;s, or deepe&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>

<P>WE got thither about two o'clock, at noon, and were acco&s;ted with a great deal of ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality, by the parent &s;quire, and two <HI>familiar cou&s;ins</HI> of the family. Sack and cakes were immediately called for, and the fa|ther, filling up an half-pint rummer, pre&s;ented it to the bridegroom, crying, Pop down this <HI>primer,</HI> my young &s;oldier, for a man mu&s;t make but a feeble a&s;&s;ault on't, that has not a <HI>dram</HI> of courage in him. Ha, ha, ha! good, good! damn'd good, that! cried the cou&s;ins.</P>
<P>My friend excu&s;ed him&s;elf from the draught, &s;aying that he needed no &s;uch auxiliary, that he &s;hould not be found ba&s;hful on the field of bat|tle, that he had &s;een <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> &amp;c. Phar&s;alia, Phar&s;alia, cried the old gentleman, why that is not my wench's name, d'ye mind me; &s;he was chri&s;tened <HI>Ethelinda,</HI> I remember very well&mdash; Her godmother was an old romantic maiden lady, and had picked up that unchri&s;tian name, out of &s;ome heatheni&s;h book, or other.</P>
<P>That may be, Sir, &s;aid I, winking at my friend, but lovers claim an ancient privilege, &s;tiled <HI>Poetica Licentia,</HI> of giving their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es a
<PB N="190" REF="217">
&s;ort of poetical bapti&s;m, and of borrowing names from hi&s;tory, or romance.</P>
<P>Very good, very good, replied the &s;quire; but, prithee, &s;ays he, who was this &s;ame&mdash;what's the word? Phar&s;alia, replied I. Ay, this &s;ame Phar&s;alia, that I find is now become my daugh|ter's <HI>nick-name?</HI></P>
<P>That is a name, replied I, well known in an|tient &s;tory, at who&s;e relentle&s;s feet many thou|&s;ands have died, in &s;trife to win her. A cruel jade, a cruel jade, quoth the &s;quire&mdash;The beau|ties of your <HI>outlandi&s;h times,</HI> continued he, were terrible people, terrible people, indeed, Sir. But, thank our &s;tars, they are all of them <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> now. Dead and gone, and rotten too, for all their conceit, I dare &s;ay, long before this. And there is no dying for love now-a-days, not in the lea&s;t, not in the lea&s;t, Sirs; no more dying for love, I a&s;&s;ure you, gentlemen.

<P>THE &s;quire led the way, and we followed him into the parlour, where we &s;aluted the ladies, and took our places. I was &s;truck with the whole air, and per&s;on of the bride, al|together, but did not fix my eyes upon her at|tentively enough to di&s;tingui&s;h her beauties, out of regard to good breeding; as the looks of a &s;tranger might have thrown her into confu&s;ion, at &s;uch a delicate cri&s;is as this.</P>
<P>And indeed, this politene&s;s I &s;oon found to be but common humanity toward her; for &s;he had a world of <HI>&s;orry mirth</HI> to &s;u&s;tain, from the vulgar facetiou&s;ne&s;s of her father, and cou&s;ins,
<PB N="192" REF="219">
who exhau&s;ted all the common-place je&s;ts, and railleries, that are u&s;ually thrown out by <HI>merry dulne&s;s,</HI> upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The bridegroom too, joined in the &s;ame <HI>&s;tu|pid humour,</HI> though I &s;aid every thing I could to re&s;train him from it. I hinted to him, in French, that though, in the re&s;t, it might be ill breeding only, in him it was indecent, al&s;o. He replied that he had a de&s;ign in it, for coyne&s;s was trouble&s;ome, and that he always ob&s;erved when womon once became familiar with <HI>ideas,</HI> they were &s;eldom apt to &s;tart at <HI>things.</HI> I an&s;wered that he mu&s;t not only be an indelicate, but an indi&s;creet hu&s;band too, who would de&s;ire to le&s;&s;en a wife's mode&s;ty; but to call in foreign aid, for that purpo&s;e, added I, is gro&s;s indeed!</P>
<P>The father &s;till went on, blundering in &s;en&s;e, and mi&s;taking in expre&s;&s;ion. While the <HI>fami|liar</HI> cou&s;ins made more than amends, by &s;peak|ing rather <HI>too plain,</HI> arre&s;ting every innocent word that was uttered, by any of the ladies, and tor|turing it to confe&s;s a <HI>double entendre.</HI></P>
<P>Among all the improper behaviour of men toward women, I think that the wre&s;ting a &s;ingle to a double &s;en&s;e, is the mo&s;t inex|cu&s;eable. A rape upon their per&s;ons, may have &s;ome temptation, but one on their words can po&s;&s;ibly have none; and the violating an inno|cent

expre&s;&s;ion into an immode&s;t &s;en&s;e, may ju&s;tly be cen&s;ured under this har&s;h appellation.</P>
<P>There is certainly, in &s;ome men, &s;uch a ma|lady, as <HI>gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of ears,</HI> which, like a dull me|dium, gives a bluntne&s;s to the acute&s;t &s;ounds. I would have the <HI>aures a&s;ini</HI> affixed to &s;uch an head, which, like Midas, prefers a &s;atyr's voice, to the melody of Apollo; and that may be com|pared to bli&s;ters, which extract only the foule&s;t humours. Immode&s;t wits may be re&s;embled to beggars, who betray their poverty, by expo&s;ing their <HI>nakedne&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>DUring the entertainment, the parlour door was left open, to &s;tun us with the noi&s;e of &s;hrill fiddles, and hoar&s;e hautboys; which &s;upplied &s;till fre&s;h occa&s;ion of in&s;ipid mirth, by affording opportunities of calling for certain tunes, with arch names; but, at the &s;ame time, they &s;erved to drown a good deal of the ribaldry that was bandied about, while the dinner la&s;ted, which therefore, in &s;ome &s;ort, reconciled me to the interruption, for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="221">But I have generally thought the introduction of mu&s;ic, at meals, to be a mo&s;t ab&s;urd enter|tainment.

<P>ABOUT &s;ix o'clock in the evening, we were &s;ummoned into the drawing-room to tea, where we found the par&s;on ready to per|form his office. After the ceremony was over, every one &s;aluted the bride, in cour&s;e; and when the &s;quire gave her his ble&s;&s;ing, perceiving that &s;he trembled a good deal, he cried out, Hey girl, are you falling into a <HI>panatic?</HI> Look ye there, look ye there, &s;aid he, pointing to her

mother, &s;he had the &s;ame <HI>frantics,</HI> in her time, wench, and yet you &s;ee that &s;he is &s;till alive, to tell the &s;tory&mdash;The cou&s;ins, the par&s;on, and the footmen laughed.</P>
<P>After tea the mu&s;ic &s;truck up again, and the ball began; the father and mother led up, I ex|cu&s;ed my&s;elf from mirth, Beville danced with the bride, the bridegroom with one of the para|nymphs, fir&s;t cou&s;in with the other, the par&s;on with <HI>my lady's woman,</HI> and &s;econd cou&s;in with a chair.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ix couple <HI>jigged it away,</HI> as one of the cou&s;ins termed it, for the re&s;t of the evening, with a great deal of ru&s;tic mirth and jocularity; the only part of which that I remember, was what the par&s;on &s;aid, on their fir&s;t &s;etting out. Exulting at the preference he had obtained over poor &s;econd coz, who &s;tood next under him, What, Mr. Tom, &s;aid he, are you tired al|ready? Tired, Sir, tired! prithee how came &s;uch a crotchet into your <HI>nobb,</HI> Mr. Par&s;on? Why really, Mr. Tom, replied he, is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that a man is &s;o, when he <HI>takes a chair?</HI> Here a loud laugh&mdash;Ay, but doc|tor, doctor, <HI>par&s;on upon Dorothy,</HI> I have this ad|vantage over you, again, that when I am tired, I may re&s;t my&s;elf in my partner's lap, which is
<PB N="197" REF="224">
a liberty you dare not take for your ca&s;&s;ock, doctor&mdash;Here a louder laugh&mdash;</P>
<P>Mr. Beville entertained his fair partner with his u&s;ual good breeding. He talked to her of indifferent matters, in the gay and polite world; of plays, mu&s;ic, and dre&s;s&mdash;Not upon any par|ticular modes of the latter, but treating it only as a general topic, and expo&s;ing the improprie|ties, and extravagancies of certain fa&s;hions, where caprice reigned alone. From whence he took occa&s;ion of comparing ta&s;te and wit toge|ther, which, however they may &s;trike upon the fancy, at fir&s;t, are equally fal&s;e, &s;aid he, if one be not founded in &s;en&s;e, and the other in na|ture.</P>
<P>He found her extremely attentive, intelligent, diffident, and mode&s;t. He treated her like a rational creature, <HI>notwith&s;tanding her youth, and beauty;</HI> and was &s;o perfectly polite all the even|ing, as to keep quite clear of every &s;ubject, hint, or expre&s;&s;ion, which might even glance, or &s;eem to allude to the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>During &s;upper, he and I both concurred in the &s;ame &s;entiment, and endeavoured, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to parry all the rude merriment that was thrown out, upon this occa&s;ion. The chap|lain though, pre&s;&s;ed us hard, for he &s;hewed him|&s;elf
<PB N="198" REF="225">
indeed, mo&s;t truly orthodox&mdash;in all the my&s;teries of weddings and chri&s;tenings&mdash;which, by the warmth of his imagination, he joined &s;o clo&s;e together, in his expre&s;&s;ions, that in a bot|tle or two more, I believe he would, like the projector in Tri&s;tram Shandy, have proceeded to baptize the infant, <HI>&s;lap da&s;h, in potenti&acirc; rerum.</HI></P>
<P>Our difficulty, with regard to this gentleman, lay here; that we could not tell how to repri|mand a per&s;on, under his <HI>character,</HI> without &s;ay|ing &s;ome things, at the &s;ame time, too &s;evere for good breeding, or the laws of ho&s;pitality. We contented our&s;elves, therefore, with taking him in the groupe, and giving a turn to their <HI>prolific ein</HI> of conver&s;ation, by entering into country politics, in which none of us were in the lea&s;t concerned, or abu&s;ing the mini&s;try&mdash; becau&s;e they had never provided for any of us, with &s;uch other &s;quirely topics; in which the re&s;t of the company ingaged with <HI>modern</HI> patriot warmth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome manu&s;cripts the expre&s;&s;ion is <HI>party rage,</HI> and in others <HI>pet-valiant fury.</HI></NOTE>; to moderate the ardour of which, we frequently interluded with quibbling upon words, or retailing <HI>Joe Miller's Je&s;ts.</HI> Chu&s;ing rather, to be &s;illy, or &s;tupid, than loo&s;e, or profane&mdash;And in this turn too, they equally

<P>WHEN Mr. Beville and I were le&s;t alone, we commented upon the incidents of the day; and agreed together, that none of the men wanted under&s;tanding, within their own &s;phere, but yet, from an ignorance of the rules of good breeding and decorum, had rendered them&s;elves either ridiculous, or ab&s;urd, during the cour&s;e of the whole entertainment.</P>
<P>We then pur&s;ued this &s;ubject up to a general reflection, and Mr. Beville very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the characters which had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the antients, &s;eemed to be quite lo&s;t among us, at pre&s;ent. We have neither a So|crates, nor an Alcibiades now, &s;aid he. The good are formal, the wi&s;e &s;evere, and the learned pedantic: while the young &s;hew little &s;pirit, but again&s;t religion, the gay are profli|gate, and the unlettered unmannered al&s;o.</P>
<P>Abroad, continued he, we hear that <HI>appear|ances</HI> at lea&s;t, are &s;till pre&s;erved; and as charity
<PB N="200" REF="227">
is &s;aid <HI>to cover a multitude of &s;ins,</HI> &s;o politene&s;s has the addre&s;s to conceal a number of faults; and 'tis &s;ome merit, certainly, to be able to palliate a defect in morals, with the decent &s;ub&s;titute of manners.</P>
<P>From this reflection we carried our ob&s;erva|tions up to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, both of church and &s;tate; by taking notice that the free|dom which we are too apt to indulge our&s;elves in, of framing the councils both of our God, and king, gives a certain bravery perhaps, to our &s;peech and actions, which may po&s;&s;ibly render us greater heroes in a &s;tate of war, but are quite incompatible with a &s;tate of peace. Our ebullient &s;pirits become impatient of inac|tivity, and where a foreign enemy does not unite our prowe&s;s, we are too prone to create a &s;ort of civil di&s;cord among our&s;elves, and &s;et one half of the nation at &s;trife again&s;t the other; ei|ther by the &s;word, or by the pen.</P>
<P>By this means, the ingenuous arts of life be|come neglected, the generous emulation of ge|nius &s;ub&s;ides, all civil commerce is interrupted among us, that traffic chiefly encouraged, which tends merely toward luxury and profu&s;ene&s;s, and merit is allowed no other te&s;t, but that of <HI>party,</HI> only. Thus do we grow invalids from too much health, and even our wealth but fur|ni&s;hes
<PB N="201" REF="228">
us with means of impoveri&s;hing our&s;elves again.</P>
<P>We then parted, and retired to re&s;t. The next morning, we e&s;corted the bride home to her new empire; the father, mother, para|nymphs, fir&s;t, and &s;econd coz, with the par&s;on, forming our cavalcade; who all returned back again, the next day.</P>

<P>WHEN we had pa&s;&s;ed a week together, Mr. Beville and I attempted to take our leave, but were pre&s;&s;ed by our friend, to pa&s;s, at lea&s;t, <HI>the honey-moon,</HI> with him, as he &s;tiled it; in which invitation, the fair <HI>Ethelinda</HI> joined him, with &s;uch an air of ho&s;pitality, and polite|ne&s;s, that we readily con&s;ented to their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>She was tall, finely proportioned, fair, and of mo&s;t captivating beauty; &s;he had a grace and decency in her air, motion, and ge&s;ture, with &s;o remarkable a mildne&s;s and mode&s;ty in her countenance, that one might imagine nature had infu&s;ed no more blood into her body, than what was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to blu&s;h in her cheeks.
<PB N="202" REF="229">
In fine, there was &s;omething in her look and manner, altogether, which won one's friend&s;hip, at fir&s;t &s;ight; and I may pronounce that who|ever &s;aw her even once, with a heart not pre|ingaged, could &s;carcely have it to offer, but at &s;econd hand, to another.</P>
<P>I attended to her &s;entiments and conduct, during the time I remained in the hou&s;e, and ob&s;erved that &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a di&s;po&s;ition &s;ingularly compa&s;&s;ionate, and humane. Her charity was exten&s;ive; but I have known it &s;ometimes re&s;trained, by the fear of having it taken notice of. Her moral was curbed by her mode&s;ty alone.</P>
<P>My friend and condi&s;ciple was a mo&s;t unfit character to be yoked with hers. He was very incon&s;i&s;tent, had a princely grandeur in &s;ome things, and a pedling meanne&s;s in others. His mind might be compared to an old <HI>man&s;ion-hou&s;e,</HI> with a few large rooms, but crowded with clo|&s;ets.</P>
<P>His temper too, was incertain; for caprice, good-humour, and pa&s;&s;ion, u&s;ed to &s;hift &s;o quick upon you, that there was no pre&s;cribing to one|&s;elf any certain mea&s;ure of conduct toward him. His chearfulne&s;s re&s;embled the air pent up be|tween two hills, which in the calme&s;t day is &s;ubject to be di&s;turbed by <HI>&s;qualls.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="230">He had no &s;teady principle of action, neither. He would &s;trike his dependents this hour, and make them pre&s;ents, the next. He often gave charity, but repented of it as often, &s;o that he impoveri&s;hed his pur&s;e, without enriching his &s;oul.</P>
<P>He was indefatigable at all country diver&s;ions, without under&s;tanding any of them; and might literally be &s;aid to be <HI>a &s;lave</HI> to his &s;ports, for he was <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of none. So that I have &s;ometimes known him to <HI>lounge</HI> away whole evenings on the couch, like a tired po&s;t-boy, lamenting the fatigue, without re&s;enting the plea&s;ure. He u&s;ed to drink hard, though it always made him &s;ick; and &s;eemed generally to prefer inferior company, which appeared too vi&s;ibly in his manners. He who ever affects to be the highe&s;t of his com|pany, will probably become, in time, to be the lowe&s;t of it.</P>
<P>He had been but little conver&s;ant in polite life; for want of which he had contracted an uncouth|ne&s;s in his manner, and a freedom in his &s;peech and behaviour, that mu&s;t be extremely di&s;gu&s;t|ing to a woman of delicacy, or breeding. Joined to all which, he had fallen under the common prejudices of weak, or vulgar minds; namely, a gro&s;s &s;u&s;picion of female cha&s;tity, and an ig|norant contempt of all women's under&s;tandings.

<P>SHE had no vi&s;itors while we &s;taid in the hou&s;e, for it was in the months of Novem|ber and December, the nights dark, and the roads impa&s;&s;able; &s;o that all the compliments &s;he received upon her coming into the country, were only cards of congratulation on her mar|riage, and po&s;tponing vi&s;its till the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band u&s;ed to &s;pend his mornings in hunting or &s;hooting, and his evenings in carou|&s;als, or &s;leeping on the couch. So that her whole time was left intirely at her own di&s;po&s;al; which &s;he u&s;ed to divide between working, reading, painting, and mu&s;ic; during which occupations, Mr. Beville and I would relieve, or a&s;&s;i&s;t her, by turns.</P>
<P>We u&s;ed to read to her while &s;he was em|ployed at her pencil, or her needle, and ac|company her at the harp&s;ichord, which concert &s;he much improved by the addition of a fine voice. We u&s;ed at fir&s;t, to call upon our friend, to take his part, as I remembered he had for|merly
<PB N="205" REF="232">
been a good performer on the violin; but he had only one in the hou&s;e, which he re&s;igned to Mr. Beville, and &s;hewed &s;o little reli&s;h to an entertainment of that elegant nature, that he would not even &s;end into the neighbour|hood to borrow one.</P>
<P>In the&s;e amu&s;ements though, he would &s;ome|times interrupt us. He would &s;tride acro&s;s the carpets, with dirty boots, give his wife a ru&s;tic &s;mack, then a &s;troke of his whip over her petti|coats, and cry, <Q>the&s;e je&s;&s;amin philo&s;ophers, girl, will turn your head.

<P>The greate&s;t difficulty that Mr. Beville and I had at fir&s;t, to &s;truggle with here, was to get our&s;elves excu&s;ed from drinking; but as our ho&s;t had remembered that we had both of us always declined the lea&s;t exce&s;s of this kind, he would <HI>after this gla&s;s, or that bottle, or clear the deck, or ju&s;t take what is in the room,</HI> with &s;uch other dalliances of debauchery, &s;uffer us to <HI>make our e&s;cape;</HI> which I take to be the ju&s;te&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion, in all the peculiar phra&s;eology of drinking.</P>

<P>AFTER this manner did we pa&s;s the <HI>honey-moon</HI> together; till toward the latter end of it, Mr. Beville began to grow &s;ilent, thoughtful, and di&s;turbed; neglected his favourite &s;tudies, and u&s;ed to take long and &s;olitary walks in the wood. I quickly perceived the change, and &s;poke to him upon it. He replied, that he had lo&s;t his &s;pirits, re&s;t, and appetite, of late, and apprehended that &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e was undermining his con&s;titution, by &s;low degrees.</P>
<P>His danger, together with a languid and de|jected look which he ca&s;t upon me, at the &s;ame time, re&s;embling the la&s;t view I had had of his dear &s;i&s;ter, produced &s;uch a &s;udden effect in me, that I could not recover my&s;elf again, for the re|mainder of the evening. I retired &s;oon to my apartment, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in fruitle&s;s tears, and vainer wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The next day my dear friend found him&s;elf unable to leave his room. I &s;ent immediately for a phy&s;ician, but he was with difficulty pre|vailed on to &s;ee him. He pre&s;cribed &s;ome me|dicines, which he refu&s;ed to take with an ob&s;ti|nacy which I had never before ob&s;erved the lea&s;t

&s;ymptom of in him. In two days he was con|fined to his bed, in a raging fever.</P>
<P>I got a pallet into his room, and attended him &s;olely, my&s;elf, not &s;uffering even a &s;ervant to enter his chamber, on pretence of the danger of communicating his di&s;temper to the family; but more on account of &s;ome &s;ymptoms in his di&s;order, which greatly alarmed me with regard to the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>He raved much, and in his deliriums would frequently repeat the name of Ethelinda. Some|times he would cry out in an exta&s;y, O &s;he is all angel! nothing but air, voice, and colour! we can but &s;ee, hear, and breathe her! <HI>An Ana|dyomene</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Have a little patience, reader, and I'll an&s;wer you to that que&s;tion, by and by.

compo&s;ed to re&s;t, that he might have an oppor|tunity of feeling his pul&s;e, and pre&s;cribing for him, according to the changes in his di&s;order, without the hazard of &s;uffering a &s;ecret to e&s;cape which had already given me &s;uch complicated unea&s;ine&s;s, and might farther be attended too with &s;uch unhappy con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In a few days he began to recover his rea&s;on, and in ten more was pronounced out of danger, though his &s;pirits &s;till continued extremely low. I con&s;tantly kept up the appearance of chearful|ne&s;s in his company, and whenever I found my art begin to fail me, I u&s;ed to &s;elect books of the highe&s;t wit and humour I could meet with in the fair Ethelinda's &s;tudy, to entertain him. Serious or religious writings would have been improper for him, at that time.</P>
<P>I took not the lea&s;t notice of his raving hints to him, nor did he remember any thing of the matter, him&s;elf, or let me any farther into the &s;ecret, except by &s;uch involuntary intimations as &s;ighing at the &s;ound of her name in a me&s;&s;age to inquire his health; or by a vi&s;ible emotion upon hearing her voice as &s;he walked under his window; with &s;uch other <HI>unequivocal</HI> &s;igns of love, more certain than the mo&s;t explicit decla|rations of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>AS his fever was not inflammatory, I did not confine my&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely to his room after his delirium had cea&s;ed, but u&s;ed to go down to meals, and during the intervals of his re&s;t. I found the tender and humane Ethelinda extremely concerned at Mr. Beville's indi&s;po&s;i|tion, and very a&s;&s;iduous about his cure. She mea&s;ured the proportions, and compounded the medicines her&s;elf, and appointed her &s;ervants to relieve each other, by turns, in &s;itting up every night in the ante-chamber.</P>
<P>She al&s;o intreated the favour of her hu&s;band not to bring home any of his <HI>jolly blades,</HI> during Mr. Beville's illne&s;s, as his chamber happened to lie directly over the dining parlour. He com|plied indeed with her reque&s;t, by &s;taying gene|rally abroad with one or other of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t two or three days after I had u&s;ed to come down out of the &s;ick room, the weather happening to be unfit for &s;ports, the condi&s;ciple and I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of our time in her dre&s;&s;ing-room, which he employed chiefly, in di&s;coun|tenancing her from reading, holding lectures upon hu&s;wifry, and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, or in
<PB N="210" REF="237">
&s;peaking or romping with her after too free and cour&s;e a manner, before her maids, or me.</P>
<P>I quickly perceived how much &s;he was di&s;|gu&s;ted at &s;uch &s;entiments and behaviour, and u&s;ing the privileges of long and early friend&s;hip, I reprehended him for it, &s;ometimes in private, and &s;ometimes before her, as the occa&s;ion hap|pened to urge, or that I found her to be af|fected.</P>
<P>This piece of good breeding rendered her at length, &s;o much at her ea&s;e before me, that &s;he u&s;ed to &s;peak to me with the &s;ame freedom as &s;he might to a brother; which, joined to the open and ingenuous frankne&s;s of her nature, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve in her manners, but what mode&s;ty, or politene&s;s had in&s;pired, led her to addre&s;s me thus, one evening, ju&s;t after my friend, having thrown her into confu&s;ion by &s;peaking to her &s;omewhat too indecently before me, had quitted the room and was rating at a footman in the hall.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, what is the rea&s;on that there &s;hould be &s;o remarkable a difference in the manners of men? While I am in Mr. Be|ville's company, or yours, I am &s;en&s;ible of both the plea&s;ure, and the pride of con&s;idering my&s;elf as a rational and independent creature, a per&s;on of &s;ome rank, or character, in life; but in the
<PB N="211" REF="238">
pre&s;ence of my father, or my hu&s;band, I feel the humiliation of finding my&s;elf dwindling by turns, into an hou&s;e-keeper, or a <HI>puppet-doll.</HI></P>
<P>I have, continued &s;he, had but little oppor|tunity of becoming conver&s;ant with polite life. I have, indeed, &s;ometimes read the characters of it in books; but in comparing them with tho&s;e of my father, cou&s;ins, the chaplain, and our neighbouring &s;quires, though all of them very good &s;ort of men, in the main, I have hi|therto been apt to impute the de&s;criptions I had met with, intirely to the wanton imagination of romance, and u&s;ed to rank &s;uch chimeras in the cla&s;s of genii's and centaur's. But &s;ome ob&s;er|vations which I have lately had an occa&s;ion of making, added &s;he, and bowing toward me, have convinced me that good breeding is not purely ideal, and that men may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;e, manners, and virtue, without being above the &s;tature of others, or having the power of rendering them&s;elves invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>I bowed, in return, thanked her for her too polite compliment, and replied, that the di&s;ad|vantages of not being born to rank or fortune, were &s;ometimes compen&s;ated by advantages in other things; for that the ob&s;ervations and deco|rums which were nece&s;&s;ary to conduct &s;uch per&s;ons upon equal terms through life, were
<PB N="212" REF="239">
things which their &s;uperiors in the&s;e articles, too frequently looked upon them&s;elves di&s;pen&s;ed with from paying a &s;ufficient attention to.</P>
<P>I in&s;tanced this matter in courts, where it has been ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t poli&s;hed manners were generally met with among the &s;econd or third cla&s;&s;es, rather than in the fir&s;t. I quoted al&s;o from hi&s;tory, that the mo&s;t &s;hining charac|ters had often ri&s;en from privacy to the <HI>purple;</HI> and then concluded this <HI>climax</HI> of heroes with his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty of Pru&s;&s;ia, who though born a prince, was bred a private man, till his acce&s;|&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>However, added I, this ob&s;ervation is not univer&s;al, as in the in&s;tances of the chaplain, and your cou&s;ins, for it is not every one who is born with ela&s;ticity enough to &s;pring under a weight; but they, on whom this <HI>gifted</HI> energy may have been be&s;towed, &s;hould only with humble gratitude enjoy the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> and not with arro|gance a&s;&s;ume a <HI>merit</HI> from a <HI>grace.</HI> Your argu|ment is ju&s;t, and fine, replied &s;he, but though your mode&s;ty may reduce the <HI>merit,</HI> it can never abate the <HI>excellence,</HI> of &s;uch a character.</P>

<P>ONE evening after Ethelinda and I had dined alone, and that Mr. Beville had &s;at up for two or three days, &s;he propo&s;ed to me that we &s;hould drink tea together in his apart|ment. This alarmed me. I did not think that his &s;tate, either of health or mind, was &s;uffi|ciently valid at that time, to &s;tand &s;uch an in|terview.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of it too, might po&s;&s;ibly, I feared every thing, have too much flattered his hopes. I knew his ho|nour, and his moral perfect, and had conceived as high an opinion of her innocence and virtue. But then again, he had <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;he <HI>&s;en&s;i|bility.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations I declined the pro|po&s;al, &s;aying that Mr. Beville would be extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at receiving a vi&s;it from a lady whom he had &s;o much re&s;pect for, in his pre&s;ent <HI>de&s;ha|bille.</HI> Never mind a punctilio of that kind, &s;he replied, I have vi&s;ited the &s;ick often before; my father's gout has made nur&s;e-tending familiar to me, and if I am willing to di&s;pen&s;e with forms,
<PB N="214" REF="241">
&s;aid &s;he, &s;urely neither of you can po&s;&s;ibly have any rea&s;on to be difficult about them.</P>
<P>I then thought it proper to a&s;&s;ume an higher key, and told her that my apprehen&s;ion was by no means, that Mr. Beville would not be plea&s;ed with the honour of her vi&s;it, but that I feared he might perhaps be <HI>too well plea&s;ed</HI> with it. Which la&s;t words I pronounced with a look and empha&s;is, that &s;ufficiently marked their import.</P>
<P>The lovely Ethelinda blu&s;hed, and ca&s;t down her mode&s;t eyes, at this expre&s;&s;ion. I found my&s;elf too far advanced to retreat, I therefore hurried on as fa&s;t as I could, to rid my&s;elf of a &s;ubject which I &s;o little cared to dwell upon. I gave her then an account of every particular, &s;ince my having fir&s;t ob&s;erved the change in Mr. Beville, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner I have now recited them to you.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes, and then re|plied with a &s;igh, I confe&s;s, Sir, that I am both concerned and &s;urpri&s;ed at this misfortune of your friend; but as Mr. Beville has &s;hewn &s;o much good breeding and re&s;pect toward me, as never to have given me the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of his improper pa&s;&s;ion, it would be inju&s;tice in me to expre&s;s any manner of re&s;entment upon an accidental di&s;covery of &s;o unhappy an event.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="242">But your own good &s;en&s;e and prudence, Sir, continued &s;he, lifting up her head, mu&s;t certainly think it extremely proper to remove your friend, as far as may be, from this unlucky &s;cene, when|ever the &s;afety of his health may permit. I wi&s;h him every &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s that his merit de&s;erves, or his virtue can de&s;ire; I approve his manners, and e&s;teem his character&mdash;My circum|&s;tances in life forbid me to &s;ay, or even to think more; but even thus far, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;everer air, you mu&s;t not be at liberty to pronounce; for what has e&s;caped me, in ju&s;tice to your friend, might not perhaps, in honour to my&s;elf, be proper to repeat.</P>
<P>I bowed re&s;pectfully, and having pa&s;&s;ed my word that I would never &s;uffer the lea&s;t hint of this conver&s;ation to tran&s;pire to Mr. Beville, I went up to his chamber and found him moving about the room by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the tables and chairs, trying his &s;trength, as he told me, with a de&s;ign of beginning his journey on the next day, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed at this motion ari&s;ing from him|&s;elf, but told him that I was afraid his health would not permit him to &s;et out &s;o &s;oon. To which he replied, that he was pretty certain he &s;hould be able to perform the fir&s;t day's journey,
<PB N="216" REF="243">
in our friend's coach, and that if he &s;hould not have &s;trength enough to continue his route on hor&s;eback, he would much rather linger at an inn, than where he was, for that he began to feel him&s;elf extremely unea&s;y at the trouble and difficulties his di&s;order had &s;ubjected the family to. Adding, that he had &s;tronger rea&s;ons &s;till, for removing him&s;elf, even at the hazard of his life, from that too fatal &s;cene of his pre&s;ent mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>The&s;e words he pronounced with an heavy &s;igh, and faltering accent, which however, I did not &s;eem to take the lea&s;t notice of, but replied, that I would &s;peak for the coach as &s;oon as our friend &s;hould return home that evening. Then &s;hifting the di&s;cour&s;e to general topics, I re|mained with him till he retired to re&s;t, and then went immediately down &s;tairs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="82" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I came into the parlour I found our friend ju&s;t returned home. He was much fuddled, told us that he had &s;pent a jovial day among a parcel of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, of the fir&s;t head,</HI> but
<PB N="217" REF="244">
was &s;omewhat afraid that the wine had not been quite &s;ound, for it began to make him &s;ick al|ready, and that he would, with my leave, retire immediately to bed.</P>
<P>I advi&s;ed him to take an emetic fir&s;t, which he promi&s;ed to do, and went away, de&s;iring his wife to &s;tay and entertain me at &s;upper, which ju&s;t then came upon the table. But &s;he excu&s;ed her|&s;elf, &s;aying that duty &s;hould ever take the lead of civility. Then de&s;iring me to drink the healths of all my &s;ick friends, walked up &s;tairs to her chamber, along with him.</P>
<P>I had no manner of inclination to &s;it down alone, and would have declined it, but from a nicety about giving offence to the ho&s;pitality of my ho&s;ts. I therefore went through the &s;upper with an appearance of appetite, and then filling up a bumper, drank, with a truly &s;incere heart, the double toa&s;t which our fair landlady had re|commended to me, joining her health and hap|pine&s;s along with it.</P>
<P>Thus left alone, I began to reflect, as u&s;ual, upon the unhappy circum&s;tances of poor Beville's fortunes, and my own. I revolved many &s;chemes in my mind, but what &s;ignifies rea&s;on|ing, without premi&s;&s;es? At length I re&s;olved upon this mea&s;ure, that we &s;hould both join our little fund and application together, to|ward

<P>While I was revolving the&s;e thoughts in my mind, the po&s;t arrived, and the packet of letters was laid upon the table, among which I &s;aw one directed to my&s;elf.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London.</HI></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Staid a few days here, after my good friends, Mr. Beville and you, had left it. The mi|ni&s;ter of St. Martin's, in who&s;e pari&s;h I found out that your father lived, was my old ac|quaintance, and cotemporary, at Oxford. I paid him a vi&s;it, renewed my intimacy with him, entered into the &s;ubject of your &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, and got him, very readily indeed, to concur with me in jointly employing our good offices and addre&s;s, toward bringing your father into a proper &s;en&s;e, both of your merit, and his own duty.</P>
<P>My friend invited me to dinner, the next day, and introduced me to your father, without drop|ping the lea&s;t hint of my profe&s;&s;ion, having be|fore directed me to lay a&s;ide my clerical habit, upon that occa&s;ion; telling me, that Mr. An|drews, though a mo&s;t rigid churchman, had, from &s;ome per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t, conceived a &s;trong prejudice again&s;t the <HI>private character</HI> of a cler|gyman; and that one moral &s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">, &s;poken
<PB N="220" REF="247">
by a <HI>lay-man,</HI> would have more weight with him, than fifty, pronounced by an <HI>hireling,</HI> as he is apt to &s;tile <HI>a par&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;pent the day very chearfully together, and I played off his own character, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t him&s;elf, by helping him to <HI>roa&s;t the par|&s;on,</HI> who pretended &s;ometimes to be &s;erious upon it, in order to heighten the &s;port, that I won his affections &s;o far as to be invited to dine with him the following day, which I mo&s;t rea|dily accepted of.</P>
<P>The next day, after dinner, I a&s;ked your fa|ther what had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with &s;uch a re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the clergy, con&s;idered per&s;onally, while he appeared, at the &s;ame time, to have a very orthodox belief of their appointment, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the high importance of their of|fice?</P>
<P>He replied, that his father and brother had been both clergymen; the fir&s;t di&s;inherited him, in favour of a &s;econd wife's children, and the latter had left him involved for five hundred pounds, which had given him a mortal aver&s;ion to the <HI>ca&s;&s;ock.</HI> This &s;tory I had been appri&s;ed of before, by my friend, and only led him into it, in order to &s;upply an occa&s;ion of exclaiming loudly, again&s;t the inju&s;tice of his father, toward him, which I did.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="248">Yes, Sir, &s;aid he, and if you'll con&s;ider at the &s;ame time, that I was not, on my part, guilty of any one act of di&s;obedience, to provoke him to &s;uch a <HI>diabolical partiality.</HI> No, Sir, I replied, that is a circum&s;tance, which I can by no means admit into con&s;ideration, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this; for no conduct of a child, which does not contradict the laws of God, or man, can po&s;&s;ibly be pretended, as a palliation, for &s;o unparental a &s;everity.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed this &s;ubject no farther, at that time, becau&s;e I did not chu&s;e to let him perceive my de&s;ign, too abruptly; &s;o I &s;hifted the &s;ubject to indifferent matters, and &s;oon after took my leave; having fir&s;t ingaged him to &s;pend a few days with me, in the country, telling him that the <HI>par&s;on</HI> there, would e&s;cort him. I fixed the time afterwards, with my friend, and left Lon|don the next morning.</P>
<P>They both of them came down to me, ac|cording to agreement, and we pa&s;&s;ed our time plea&s;antly enough, as I exerted my&s;elf to the ut|mo&s;t &s;tretch of ho&s;pitality, toward my new gue&s;t. I &s;till concealed my <HI>par&s;on&s;hip,</HI> during the re|mainder of the week, for though we had prayers, as u&s;ual, morn and eve, I appointed my friend of St. Martin's, to the office of chaplain, during that time.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="249">I had your lovely children, my dear Andrews, in the hou&s;e with me, all the while, and fre|quently called them into the parlour to fondle with before him, letting them pa&s;s for relations of my own. He was &s;truck with their beauty, and u&s;ed to take them often on his knee, by turns. I have &s;ometimes felt my&s;elf a little aukward, on account of my di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s toward him; but then I quickly &s;olved it again, by thinking that if ever a <HI>pious fraud</HI> was allow|able, it mu&s;t be in &s;o virtuous a cau&s;e as this.</P>
<P>At length, Sunday morning arrived. I &s;ent off my gue&s;ts to church before me, and when I had put on my proper garb, I followed them, walking through the i&s;le, directly into the de&s;k, where my friend the clergyman had taken his place before me, after having &s;eated Mr. An|drews in a pew oppo&s;ite to the pulpit. St. Mar|tin's read prayers, and I preached that day, upon a text &s;elected for the occa&s;ion, namely, the fifth commandment.</P>
<P>In this di&s;cour&s;e, I carried the duty of chil|dren up to the highe&s;t degree, by &s;hewing fir&s;t, the general &s;en&s;e of mankind, upon this article, from the earlie&s;t account of nations, and among even the mo&s;t &s;avage race of men; and then wound up my doctrine, by confirming this great
<PB N="223" REF="250">
natural, and moral obligation, with the expre&s;s command of God.</P>
<P>I then proceeded to con&s;ider, on the other hand, the great and alarming duty of parents toward their children; which point I carried even higher than the former. For after having fir&s;t inculcated it from nature, morals, and uni|ver&s;al concurrence, I pleaded even the &s;ilence of the decalogue, in this article, as an argument to confirm it.</P>
<P>We have, &s;aid I, a command, not <HI>to kill;</HI> but none again&s;t <HI>&s;uicide.</HI> We have al&s;o a pre|cept to <HI>love our neighbour;</HI> but none to <HI>love our child.</HI> And this, becau&s;e it was thought &s;uper|fluous to frame injunctions, for, or again&s;t things, whereof the pa&s;&s;ion, or aver&s;ion, had been &s;o &s;trongly rooted already, both in our rea&s;on, and our nature.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I concluded, that an unkind parent mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a reprobate both to rea&s;on, to nature, and to <HI>grace;</HI> and I preached the &s;ermon, with that natural, and mo&s;t per&s;ua|&s;ive kind of eloquence, exceeding all the arts of oratory, with which a per&s;on is indued upon a &s;ubject where his mind is convinced, and his heart affected.</P>
<P>During the duties of this morning, I did not attend to any particular, which did not relate
<PB N="224" REF="251">
immediately to the offices of the day; therefore, I could not perceive what manner of effect, ei|ther my unexpected appearance, under a new and &s;olemn character, or the arguments of my doctrine, might have produced, upon my mo&s;t immediate object, next to God; but, on my de&s;cending into the i&s;le, and &s;aluting Mr. An|drews in the mid&s;t of the congregation, he &s;eemed to be in a &s;ort of confu&s;ion, and received my addre&s;s with a certain di&s;tant re&s;pect, and awed obei&s;ance, which gratified me extremely&mdash; not from <HI>cleric pride,</HI> but <HI>chri&s;tian charity.</HI></P>
<P>As we walked home together from church, he a&s;ked me why I had concealed my profe&s;|&s;ion from him, all this while? To which I an|&s;wered, that in general, I neither took pains to reveal, or conceal it, but would however, rather chu&s;e to &s;uffer that particular, always to remain a &s;ecret, among &s;trangers. Becau&s;e, &s;aid I, &s;hould they happen to be <HI>good, and formal,</HI> epi|thets too frequently joined, the awe of it might, po&s;&s;ibly, throw &s;ome re&s;traint upon the freedom of conver&s;ation; and if <HI>profligate, and ill-bred,</HI> which are terms as often coupled, it might tempt &s;uch characters to become rather too free. We &s;hould be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> every where, &s;aid I, turning toward our friend of St. Martin's, but <HI>par&s;ons,</HI> only in our pulpits.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="252">During the remainder of the day, I behaved toward your father, with the &s;ame ea&s;e and free|dom as u&s;ual, but perceived that he, on his part, &s;eemed to hold a greater re&s;erve over his &s;peech and manners, than before. I took notice of this particular to him, and he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed to me, that he could not readily got the better of the &s;urpri&s;e which had &s;eized him, upon &s;eeing me walk through the i&s;le in the &s;acred habit, and take my place at the de&s;k, before he had been in the lea&s;t appri&s;ed of my profe&s;&s;ion; and that the &s;uddenne&s;s of the tran&s;ition, from my &s;uppo&s;ed, to my real character, had &s;truck him &s;omewhat like a divine vi&s;ion, and impre&s;|&s;ed his mind with a certain religious awe, which he could not, for that day at lea&s;t, nor de&s;ired, during his life, ever to get the better of.</P>
<P>In the evening, I brought your dear infants into the parlour, in my arms, and placing them on their little knees before him, &s;aid, Since this has been a day for di&s;covering of &s;ecrets, Sir, I &s;hall now acquaint you with one, which is of infinitely greater moment to you, than that which you were let into this morning&mdash;Here, Sir, are your grandchildren&mdash;who&s;e mother your cruelty has already &s;ent weeping to the grave, has reduced their father to a wandering exile, and driven the&s;e lovely <HI>innocents, the&s;e peculiar

<P>The &s;trength of my expre&s;&s;ion, with the &s;tern|ne&s;s of my look, and the voice of authority, which I thought proper to a&s;&s;ume upon &s;o ju&s;ti|fiable an occa&s;ion, threw Mr. Andrews into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and I could perceive a certain mixture of &s;hame, horror, and &s;elf-condemna|tion, in his countenance, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I turned carele&s;ly a&s;ide, to leave him at liberty to collect him&s;elf, and indeed in order to hide my own di&s;turbance, al&s;o. Upon which, he ha&s;tily laid his hands on the children's heads, crying, in an hurry, God ble&s;s you, God ble&s;s you both. Then &s;aying he was not very well, he &s;uddenly quitted the room, and retired to his chamber. I then &s;natched up the children in my arms, ki&s;&s;ed them, and wept; while the &s;portive innocents &s;at &s;miling at each other, and club|bing their little mi&s;chief together, to throw off my wig upon the floor.</P>
<P>Mr. Andrews came in to &s;upper, and after the cloth had been removed, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me thus: You acco&s;ted me this evening, Sir, &s;aid he, with &s;uch a &s;uddenne&s;s, and &s;eve|rity, that I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf to have been to|tally deprived of all power of vindicating my character, from &s;o heavy a charge.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="254">I am truly &s;orry for the fatal con&s;equences you have mentioned to me; but then, Sir, I hope you will admit, that the&s;e have ari&s;en &s;olely from my &s;on's own undutifulne&s;s, and cannot, therefore, be in the lea&s;t imputed to my <HI>cruelty,</HI> as you were plea&s;ed, ju&s;t now, to &s;tile it.

<P>Sir, &s;aid I, whatever the tenour of our lives may be, we ought to be more particularly care|ful of the la&s;t, than about any other act of it. A will, Sir, though perfected at any time of our lives, as it is not to take effect, till after our death, ought certainly to be con&s;idered in this mo&s;t intere&s;ting light; and we &s;hould therefore, never attempt to &s;it down to &s;o tremendous a work, but in &s;uch a temper of charity and for|givene&s;s, as we would perform any other action in our late&s;t moments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This point was enough for the clergyman to in&s;i&s;t on, upon this occa&s;ion; but Marcus Aurelius carries the moral farther, by advi&s;ing to con&s;ider <HI>every</HI> action of our lives, as if it were to be our la&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="255">Sir, &s;aid he, all this may be very ingenious rea&s;oning, for any thing I know, but as the laws of the land have inve&s;ted me with an <HI>ab&s;olute do|minion</HI> over my fortune, I think that no per&s;on what&s;oever, can po&s;&s;ibly urge <HI>a claim of right,</HI> again&s;t me; <HI>a petition of favour,</HI> is the utmo&s;t they can pretend to, and my elde&s;t &s;on, by di&s;|obedience, has forfeited even this pretence.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, I replied, we are not here litigating this point, according to law, but merely deba|ting it agreeably to ju&s;tice. Your <HI>ab&s;olute domi|nion</HI> I di&s;pute not, but Heaven is not a court of <HI>law,</HI> but of <HI>equity;</HI> before which dread tribunal, a &s;uppliant is required to do ju&s;tice fir&s;t, him&s;elf, before he can be intitled to receive it.

<P>The&s;e la&s;t expre&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to &s;tartle him; he immediately appeared to retire into his own thoughts, and a dead &s;ilence en&s;ued on all &s;ides, for &s;ome minutes; till the bell rang for family prayers, which I admini&s;tered my&s;elf; and had the &s;incere plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve that Mr. Andrews joined in them with a more em|phatical devotion, than u&s;ual.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="256">Our &s;upper pa&s;&s;ed away in general &s;ubjects, but a good deal con&s;trained; and the next morn|ing, Mr. Andrews took his leave, and returned back to London.

<P>He did &s;o, and wrote to me, the next po&s;t, acquainting me that Mr. Andrews &s;eemed to have been a good deal awed, was more thought|ful than u&s;ual, had &s;everal times repeated to him&s;elf, the words <HI>right,</HI> and <HI>power;</HI> and had treated him, all along, though a <HI>par&s;on,</HI> with &s;omewhat more of decorum, than he was wont to do.

<P>Thus far, my dear Andrews, had I written to you, a month ago, but delayed &s;ending the letter, upon my friend's la&s;t hint, in order to wait the final re&s;ult, either to be able to afford you a &s;ucce&s;sful account of my interpo&s;ition, al|together, or not to interrupt your re&s;ignation and philo&s;ophy, with fruitle&s;s hopes.</P>
<P>La&s;t Monday I came up to London, in order to feel my patient's pul&s;e again, and accordingly

waited upon your father, the next day. I found him in an high fever, but perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, and much plea&s;ed to &s;ee me.

<P>THIS Letter, continued Mr. Andrews, af|fected me extremely, in various ways; I was charmed with the active virtue of my friend, I rejoiced at the proper, though late moral of my father, and do declare that the fir&s;t and principal plea&s;ure I received from this fortunate event, was in the reflection of his having been brought, at length, to a ju&s;t and equitable &s;en&s;e, of his parental obligations. I re&s;ented the <HI>grant,</HI> more than the <HI>gift,</HI> and was &s;en&s;ible of a certain pious tran&s;port, in thinking that this la&s;t act of my father's, had retrieved his character, and &s;ealed his merits.</P>
<P>But, oh! my friend, what a torrent of tears ru&s;hed from my eyes, at the thought of my dear wife's death, ju&s;t then occurring to my mind at the in&s;tant of the&s;e reflections! How did I la|ment her mi&s;&s;ing of that virtuous tran&s;port, which would have affected her fond heart and generous &s;oul, at &s;eeing her hu&s;band and her children thus &s;ecurely placed beyond the &s;corn of fools, and &s;purn of fortune! In fine, I was &s;truck with &s;uch a complicated emotion, of filial gratitude, conjugal grief, and parental joy, that
<PB N="232" REF="259">
it was late before I could compo&s;e my&s;elf to prayer, or re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning I lay &s;o long, that Mr. Be|ville, impatient to fly that fatal &s;cene, had come into my room, and a&s;ked me whether I had prepared every thing ready for our journey. I told him that our ho&s;t had returned home, the night before, &s;o much out of order, that I did not think proper to mention our going, ju&s;t at that time; but as I had received a letter from our friend the clergyman, la&s;t night's po&s;t, with an account of my father's illne&s;s, I thought it might afford a fair pretext for quitting the hou&s;e, &s;o abruptly, and that I would immediately ri&s;e, and &s;end in a me&s;&s;age to borrow the po&s;t-chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Beville was &s;till &s;o weak, that even his &s;hort walk acro&s;s the gallery to my chamber, had fatigued him &s;o much, that he was forced to lay him&s;elf on the bed, by me. I did not think it prudent, in &s;uch a &s;tate of health, to acquaint him with the full contents of the letter; as the plea&s;ure it would have afforded him, might po&s;&s;ibly have had too &s;udden an effect upon his pre&s;ent low condition of &s;trength and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e immediately, and as &s;oon as I heard my condi&s;ciple's bell ring, I &s;ent Mr. Beville's compliments and mine to inquire how he was,
<PB N="233" REF="260">
acquainting him with the &s;ummons we had re|ceived, and de&s;iring the favour of his equipage to convey my friend the fir&s;t day's journey, at lea&s;t, as his health was not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed to venture on hor&s;eback, &s;o immediately upon quitting his chamber.</P>
<P>He returned his compliments, &s;aid he had di&s;charged his &s;tomach by an emetic, the la&s;t night, found him&s;elf pretty ea&s;y that morning, but was ju&s;t going to take a medicine which would prevent him the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing us. He or|dered the po&s;t-chai&s;e, wi&s;hed us a good journey, and added, that he would be glad to &s;ee us both again, as &s;oon as our affairs might permit.</P>
<P>The fair Ethelinda too, &s;ent us her compli|ments, and de&s;ired that we &s;hould take the chai&s;e on to London with us, if we found it either nece&s;&s;ary, or convenient; but, from a very becoming nicety, which confirmed my opinion and e&s;teem for her, neither joined in her hu&s;band's invitation, nor came down to breakfa&s;t, on pretence that her attendance on him, required her &s;taying above.</P>
<P>Mr. Beville and I breakfa&s;ted together, and immediately after, &s;et out upon our journey.</P>

<P>DUring the fir&s;t day's &s;tage, I avoided all particular conver&s;ation with my friend, &s;peaking chiefly upon general topics; pointing out to him the &s;everal beauties of the country through which we pa&s;&s;ed, which were &s;o &s;trong as to manife&s;t them&s;elves, even through Decem|ber &s;nows.</P>
<P>It was now near Chri&s;tmas&mdash;I made reflections upon that hallowed &s;ea&s;on, and took notice of the remarkable goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and oeco|nomy of Providence, in appointing that great fe&s;tival to fall upon a time of the year, when the hu&s;bandman's labours are &s;u&s;pended, and that nature had already ordained a vacation, to re|joice in! At the mo&s;t gloomy period of the year, to &s;end us the mo&s;t <HI>glad tidings,</HI> that ever yet have reached the &s;ons of man!</P>
<P>I do not recollect, Mr. Carewe, &s;aid Andrews, that the&s;e remarks have been ever made before, by any of our divines. They occurred to my mind, upon this occa&s;ion, for the fir&s;t time; they warmed my heart, amid&s;t December fro&s;ts, and I endeavoured to communicate the &s;ame fervour from them, to my friend; in order to di&s;pel his melancholy, and elevate his thoughts
<PB N="235" REF="262">
to a &s;ublimer pa&s;&s;ion, to a love equally void of &s;atiety, or de&s;pair; and which, contrary to all other objects of de&s;ire, we are nearer the frui|tion of, in age, than youth.</P>
<P>He joined in my reflections, with that reli|gious and philo&s;ophic turn of mind, which was natural, and habitual to him, and which gave me &s;trong rea&s;on to believe that if I could detain him in &s;ome di&s;tant &s;cene, where he might never &s;ee, or even hear the name of the too lovely Ethelinda more, his heart would &s;oon recover its former &s;pring again. For without hope, pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ts not long; and I knew that his virtue forbad him even to frame a wi&s;h, which might &s;erve to keep it alive.</P>
<P>When we had been &s;ettled for the evening, at our inn, he a&s;ked me what &s;cheme of life I had planned out for us both; for you were more at lei&s;ure than I, &s;aid he, with a &s;igh, for &s;uch contemplations, during our late vi&s;it in the country.</P>
<P>I told him of the purpo&s;e which I had framed ju&s;t before I received the letter, and added, that I had &s;ome encouragement from my friend, to hope that all matters would be accommodated between my father and me, as &s;oon as we &s;hould arrive in London. How &s;hould I rejoice at &s;uch an event, replied he, but much I fear that mi&s;|fortune
<PB N="236" REF="263">
has marked us for her victims! Such ex|traordinary incidents! &s;uch uncommon adven|tures!</P>
<P>We made a &s;light repa&s;t, went early to bed, and pur&s;ued our journey the next morning, in the chair. He &s;eemed to be much recruited in health, but &s;till too weak to venture to ride, or even drive po&s;t; &s;o we travelled together at his lei&s;ure, through the whole journey.</P>
<P>This &s;econd day I found him continue thought|ful, and melancholic, and imagined from the hint he had given me, when he pre&s;&s;ed to quit the country, with &s;ome others which he had let drop, the night before, that he would be plea&s;ed to be que&s;tioned upon this &s;ubject, though his delicacy &s;eemed backward to propo&s;e it, in a more direct way, him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered al&s;o, that it is a great relief to a mind oppre&s;&s;ed, to be at liberty to communicate its unea&s;ine&s;s to a friend; and being my&s;elf al&s;o, &s;ollicitous to know how high his pa&s;&s;ion might have ari&s;en, or what kind of &s;entiments he had him&s;elf about it, I re&s;olved to enter upon the &s;ubject with him, at our next &s;tage; and accord|ingly, after dinner, acco&s;ted him thus:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="86" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="237" REF="264">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear friend and brother, the di&s;order which you have been lately affected with, has given me mo&s;t extreme apprehen&s;ion, and concern; which is, however, rather increa&s;ed, than abated, by your recovery; if we may &s;tile it one, while it leaves you &s;till &s;ubject to the depre&s;&s;ed and melancholic &s;tate, which your mind and &s;pirits &s;eem, ever &s;ince, to have la|boured under.</P>
<P>And yet, even this, is by no means, my principal concern about you; for the mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate di&s;tempers are &s;till within the dominion of phy&s;ic: But, I am much afraid, from &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions which have e&s;caped you in your ravings, with others that you have thrown out, &s;ince the recovery of your rea&s;on, that your principal malady may be of that nature which Ovid &s;ays,
<Q>Non e&s;t medicabilis herbis.</Q></P>
<P>He blu&s;hed, and appeared in confu&s;ion; but quickly a&s;ked me, with great emotion, after what manner he had expo&s;ed the &s;ecret, or be|trayed his pa&s;&s;ion, during his delirium? I &s;oon made him ea&s;y, with regard to this particular,
<PB N="238" REF="265">
by a&s;&s;uring him that no ears, but his own and mine, happened to have been within the reach of his voice, on his fir&s;t extravagance, and then acquainting him of the precaution I had u&s;ed, during the remainder of his di&s;traction.</P>
<P>O! then, cried he out, in a tran&s;port, my alarmed mind is again re&s;tored to peace, and this &s;ecret &s;hall be now entombed with me; for I may truly &s;ay, that it hath not yet e&s;caped me, &s;ince you alone, my &s;econd &s;elf, are the only ma&s;ter of it. Yes, my dear Andrews, I confe&s;s the <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> but deny the <HI>guilt.</HI> It was not my choice, it is not my acquie&s;cence&mdash;It was my fatality, and is my misfortune.</P>
<P>My dear Beville, I replied, the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;|picion, either of your honour, or your virtue, has never yet re&s;ted on my mind. But, in this unhappy affair, you mu&s;t give me leave to be &s;omewhat diffident, of your prudence, or di&s;cre|tion, at lea&s;t. For love, whatever the poets may have written of that pa&s;&s;ion, is a fair, and open enemy, and always affords us &s;ufficient warn|ing, for a retreat. It is by dalliance alone, that we are conquered; and after we have delivered our&s;elves over, willing victims, to the &s;oft per|&s;ua&s;ion, we would defend <HI>our own weakne&s;s,</HI> by pleading of <HI>its &s;trength.</HI> The brave&s;t, who &s;tand
<PB N="239" REF="266">
their ground, may be <HI>o'erpowered,</HI> but the fugi|tive was never yet <HI>o'ertaken.</HI></P>
<P>I intreat my dear friend, replied he, that you will be &s;o charitable as to &s;u&s;pend your judgment, till you have heard my defence; and though I tru&s;t that I &s;hall be found an object of compa&s;|&s;ion, rather than of cen&s;ure, yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the fond nicety, which I have ever had, about pre&s;erving your favourable opinion toward me, oppre&s;&s;es me, notwith&s;tanding, at pre&s;ent, with a kind of generous diffidence, on my de|feat, though conquered by &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;even as a general, before his mi&s;tre&s;s, for having lo&s;t a day, though the odds a million.</P>

<P>WHEN fir&s;t I beheld the fair Ethelinda, continued Mr. Beville, I was &s;truck with admiration at her tran&s;cendent charms; her form, her grace, her air, her features. The contemplation of beauty, in whatever &s;ubject, is natural to the mind of man; and not defended by the mo&s;t &s;evere philo&s;ophy. I indulged my|&s;elf, therefore, in this &s;ublime delight, while I
<PB N="240" REF="267">
found the cha&s;te plea&s;ure not yet de&s;cending from, the refinements of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>When I became acquainted with her mind, was conver&s;ant with her under&s;tanding; had con&s;idered her virtues, and ob&s;erved upon her manners; I found my&s;elf affected toward her, with a warmer &s;entiment indeed, but &s;till of the &s;ame platonic kind. For the beauty of morals and of nature, are reciprocally analogous; and we may become &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;en&s;ation for either, quite di&s;tinct from pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again, when I began to ob&s;erve upon the un|couth manners, and indelicate behaviour of her hu&s;band toward her, &s;eeming totally devoid of the lea&s;t ta&s;te or &s;entiment, for her mind or beauty, was it not virtue to lament her fate! This was humanity&mdash;not de&s;ire. I grudged him an happine&s;s, which he &s;eemed unworthy to en|joy. But this was envy, and not jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Thus were my admiration of her beauty, my e&s;teem of her merits, and compa&s;&s;ion for her misfortune, re&s;trained within the precincts of innocence, and virtue&mdash;As di&s;intere&s;ted, and pure, as is a brother's love. Under &s;uch cha&s;te, and delicate &s;entiments as the&s;e, had I pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t three weeks of our acquaintance, with|out receiving the lea&s;t hint from my pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="241" REF="268">
which might have alarmed my virtue, or have warned my prudence.</P>
<P>I endeavoured often, though obliquely, to reform his manners, but without preferring my own; and have, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, even re|&s;trained my own politene&s;s toward her, where I imagined that the contra&s;t might have been too &s;trongly marked. My &s;ole de&s;ire was to have reclaimed his conduct, and my warme&s;t wi&s;h breathed for their mutual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>A father might have felt &s;uch &s;entiments&mdash;an angel might have loved her &s;o&mdash;But,</P>

<P>ONE morning, I happened to take a long and &s;olitary walk through the woods, ru|minating upon our pa&s;t misfortunes, my dear Andrews, &s;aid he, and forming vi&s;ionary &s;chemes for future life; when returning di&s;pirited and fatigued, I &s;trolled into the green parlour, and there threw my&s;elf upon the couch; where, perceiving my wearied &s;en&s;es di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t, I loo&s;ened the cords of the &s;u&s;pended curtain, and
<PB N="242" REF="269">
letting it fall carele&s;sly about me, folded my arms, and re&s;igned my&s;elf to &s;lumber.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, I was awakened by per&s;ons coming ha&s;tily into the room, and from under part of the veil, where the cord had happened not to have run to its full length, I perceived the lovely Ethelinda i&s;&s;uing from the warm bath, which lay within this apartment, attended by her maid, who laying down a parcel of cloaths upon the carpet before the fire, retired imme|diately out of the room, locking the door, and carrying off the key.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, upon this adventure; but had no retreat; and before I could po&s;&s;ibly have re&s;olved upon what mea|&s;ure of decency to ob&s;erve, the charming fair let fall her loo&s;ened wrapper to the ground, and at once revealed her naked beauties to my ra|vi&s;hed view. O, my dear friend! &s;he was <HI>ip&s;a forma</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Induiter formo&s;a e&s;t, exuiter ip&s;a forma. <BIBL><HI>Ovid.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, indeed!

<P>She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in ha&s;te, and every attitude expo&s;ed &s;ome new, &s;ome hidden charm to my racked &s;en&s;e&mdash;
<Q><PB N="243" REF="270">In me tota ruens Venus.</Q>
I gazed&mdash;I doated&mdash;A &s;udden fever ru&s;hed through all my frame&mdash;My &s;en&s;es were intranced &mdash;Rea&s;on in vain oppo&s;ed the fond delirium&mdash;I could as well command a dream&mdash;Religion was &s;u&s;pended&mdash;Cha&s;tity &s;wooned away&mdash;I quick lo&s;t all reflection; and Pigmalion's &s;tatue, new in|formed with life, was equal mi&s;tre&s;s of its pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>When &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, &s;he rung the bell for her maid, and retired out of the room, without having perceived me. I immediately aro&s;e, and &s;tole out to the woods again. How did I feel! My mind was di&s;turbed, my frame di&s;ordered. I walked through the groves like a frantic per|&s;on; now with a quick, now with a &s;low pace. The bell tolled&mdash;I returned to the hou&s;e&mdash;The dinner was &s;erved&mdash;I entered the room with con|fu&s;ion&mdash;I avoided even your eyes&mdash;I dared not look on him. But when &s;he appeared&mdash;what a two-fold emotion, equally of &s;hame, and pa&s;|&s;ion! I felt a convict&mdash;Imputed a crime to ac|cident; and, like a rifled maid, found my&s;elf &s;hocked at the unhallowed plea&s;ure, even of a guiltle&s;s deed.</P>

<P>I SHALL really be under a good deal of unea&s;ine&s;s for ye, ladies, while ye are read|ing the foregoing chapter. You had certainly a <HI>natural right</HI> to have expected &s;omewhat more of adventure, in &s;o critical, and opportune a &s;cene. A young fellow, in health and vigour. A lovely woman, <HI>in flower of youth, and beauty's pride,</HI> na|ked,

<P>Now let us frame an <HI>hypothe&s;is</HI> in this very cri&s;is, by way of argument only. Suppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that the very moment &s;he had &s;lipt her <HI>bagniane,</HI> he had &s;lipt al&s;o, into her arms&mdash;She could not, in decency, have done le&s;s than faint.

<P>In all difficult ca&s;es, one is apt to govern them|&s;elves by <HI>precedent,</HI> and as &s;he was a lady of great reading, &s;he mu&s;t &s;urely have known, that throughout all hi&s;tory, &s;acred, or prophane, there are but two examples of <HI>female cha&s;tity,</HI> upon record.

<P>But poor Mr. Beville was verily, in a mo&s;t aukward &s;ituation, as he de&s;cribes him&s;elf. I mean for &s;uch a &s;ort of man as he was.

<P>MR. Andrews, continuing his narrative, &s;aid, I really felt a mo&s;t extreme compa&s;&s;ion for my unhappy friend. Sen&s;e and virtue add &s;trength to love. The &s;ame vigour of mind, which exerts it&s;elf in rea&s;on, takes equal hold of pa&s;&s;ion; and refined affections, like purged wa|ters, pre&s;erve their properties longer than foul.</P>
<P>I therefore endeavoured to reconcile him to him&s;elf, by acquie&s;cing in his ju&s;tification. I condoled with him upon the unluckine&s;s of his adventure, and concurred in the virtuous and manly re&s;olution, which he &s;eemed to have ta|ken, of exiling him&s;elf from the object of his fatal pa&s;&s;ion, and of excluding from his mind
<PB N="248" REF="275">
all manner of fuel, which might &s;erve to nouri&s;h his unhappy flame.</P>
<P>I then thought it might relieve his &s;pirits a good deal, to let him into the intire &s;ecret of my late letter from London, and accordingly laid it before him, for his peru&s;al; &s;aying, My dear Beville, though fortune has u&s;ed us &s;ometimes for her &s;port, you &s;ee &s;he has not quite <HI>marked us for her victims,</HI> yet.</P>
<P>The reading of this letter had the de&s;ired ef|fect; it diffu&s;ed a chearfulne&s;s over his counte|nance, and he confe&s;&s;ed to me, but with an in|genuous &s;hame, that he was &s;en&s;ible of perhaps a quicker kind of plea&s;ure, in having my for|tunes e&s;tabli&s;hed by this &s;ort of revolution, than po&s;&s;ibly it might have done to have had them even augmented, through any other medium. For be&s;ides my concern for your misfortunes, my dear brother, added he, I have al&s;o laboured under a certain delicate di&s;tre&s;s, from the reflec|tion that your alliance with my family, had been the occa&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>I then took an opportunity, from this expre&s;|&s;ion, to mention a &s;entiment to him, that my heart had, for &s;ome days, with difficulty re|&s;trained; which was, that the alliance he hinted at, was not di&s;&s;olved, but devolved only, and that I hoped he would henceforth con&s;ider him|&s;elf
<PB N="249" REF="276">
as heir, in his dear &s;i&s;ter's place, to &s;hare an equal benefit in my fortunes.</P>
<P>He bowed, but quick replied, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly think of accepting a thing he had no claim to, in a ca&s;e where even the gift could not confer a title; as his &s;i&s;ter, he rejoiced to &s;ay it, had left more rightful, and more worthy heirs behind her.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wered, that as I had, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, already dedicated my fortunes to love, I could not think in the &s;econd, of ex|cluding friend&s;hip, its younger brother, from its &s;hare of the portion; and that as virtue forms &s;tronger connections than nature, the fond tie which had once allied us, would induce me ever to look upon him as a real brother, if that title were not already comprehended, under the higher and nobler one, of friend.</P>
<P>At length, after &s;everal days travelling, we ar|rived in London; he recruited by the journey, and I fatigued with the delay. We pa&s;&s;ed the evening at the inn together. The next morn|ing he went down to Wind&s;or, to wait upon his father, and I called on the mini&s;ter of St. Mar|tin's, to &s;ettle with him about the effects com|mitted to his charge.</P>
<P>He came with me to the hou&s;e, and delivered me the will, and keys. The &s;cene affected me.
<PB N="250" REF="277">
I dropt tears of filial duty, and felt my heart fill at the &s;ame time, with pious gratitude toward the great di&s;pen&s;er of all earthly, as well as hea|venly ble&s;&s;ings.</P>

<P>UPON looking into the &s;ituation of my af|fairs, I found that the family &s;uit, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;o many years, had been ended the preceding term, and the debentures, for ten thou&s;and pounds, were lying on the de&s;k, with about three hundred pounds more, in bills and ca&s;h.</P>
<P>The will had bequeathed the intire fortune to me, except two legacies of one hundred pounds, apiece, to each of my brothers; the elde&s;t of whom had been lately promoted to a troop of hor&s;e; and the younger, be&s;ides his employ|ment, had a little time before, been married to a merchant's daughter in the city, with a fortune of four thou&s;and pounds. My &s;i&s;ter had died in childbed, about &s;ix months before.</P>
<P>Both my brothers happened to be in London, at this time, and came to condole with me upon
<PB N="251" REF="278">
our late lo&s;s. I had always loved them affec|tionately, and was much rejoiced to &s;ee them. I laid the will before them, and they very gene|rou&s;ly acquie&s;ced in the di&s;po&s;ition of it, without the lea&s;t jealou&s;y, or murmur. They were both of them already well e&s;tabli&s;hed in life, and ac|knowledged the intire merit of it, to be owing to my di&s;intere&s;ted, and fraternal kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>I then paid each of them their legacy, and made a pre&s;ent, at the &s;ame time, to my mar|ried brother, of all the family plate; which might be in value, about an hundred pounds; promi&s;ing the captain al&s;o, to pay him a like compliment, whenever he &s;hould do me the plea&s;ure to invite me to his wedding.</P>
<P>In a day or two after, my friend Beville re|turned from Wind&s;or, and told me that he had found his father in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; for his attorney had informed him, that the laws could not po&s;&s;ibly afford him any manner of relief, for as he had di&s;po&s;ed of the income of his employ, during his life, he could not po&s;&s;ibly recover his office again; and that, as his deputy had &s;old his intere&s;t, and retired to Holland, there was no remedy to be had, again&s;t him, neither.</P>
<P>My friend left his father all the money he had about him, and &s;eemed to be extremely depre&s;|&s;ed, upon this additional misfortune; though I
<PB N="252" REF="279">
&s;aid every thing that friend&s;hip could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;upport his &s;pirits, by intreating that he would &s;uffer me to con&s;ider us all, as of one family; adding, that in this in&s;tance too, I might chal|lenge it as a right; as I had the honour of claim|ing his father, as mine, al&s;o.</P>

<P>I WAS impatient to &s;ee my dear children, and to return my mo&s;t grateful thanks to my valuable friend, the clergyman; but I could not think of revi&s;iting any of tho&s;e once happy &s;cenes again, which had prevented me from paying my duty, at Wind&s;or, al&s;o. I therefore wrote a letter of acknowledgment to my friend, intreating the favour of a vi&s;it from him, at Lon|don, and at the &s;ame time, &s;ent down a coach and four, to bring him up, with the children.</P>
<P>They all arrived in town, the next day, and in this fond &s;ociety, the plea&s;ures I enjoyed, were &s;o blended with tho&s;e I had lo&s;t, that I might be &s;aid to have truly felt that
<Q>"Sad luxury, to vulgar minds unknown."</Q>
So that I had but little advantage, in this parti|cular, by &s;hifting the &s;cene, while &s;uch &s;trong remembrances &s;tood &s;till before me.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="280">Poor Beville's health and &s;pirits recruited not &s;o fa&s;t as I had hoped for. He was frequently ab&s;ent, in company, and would &s;ometimes &s;uf|fer a whole morning to pa&s;s unmarked away, without books, or mu&s;ic; and when he did play, it was always in the <HI>andante, pa&s;torale,</HI> or <HI>amoro&s;o</HI> &s;train; and when he read, Ovid, Catul|lus, or Petrarch, were his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>I took notice of this turn of mind, to him, and he &s;eemed &s;o alarmed at it, him&s;elf, that he laid a&s;ide mu&s;ic intirely, as he acknowledged that harmony, of any kind, might be a dange|rous &s;olace, in the pre&s;ent di&s;turbed &s;ituation of his mind; for that the &s;oft airs but &s;oothed his pa&s;&s;ion, and the bolder ones &s;erved only to ele|vate its tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>He then began to apply him&s;elf to his former, and &s;everer &s;tudies, but was &s;oon interrupted in them, by an illne&s;s which had the appearance of a milliary fever. The phy&s;icians were called in, and determined it to be a &s;corbutic humour, which had been thrown into his blood, by checking his late di&s;order, too &s;uddenly, and &s;uffering him to come abroad, at &s;o inclement a &s;ea&s;on, before the dregs of his di&s;ea&s;e had been &s;ufficiently purged away. They pre&s;cribed him medicines, and recommended the Scarborough
<PB N="254" REF="281">
waters, and &s;ea-bathing, to him, as &s;oon as the weather might permit.</P>
<P>I took a hint from this advice, to propo&s;e to my friend, to take a journey with me, imme|diately, to Scarborough, and fix our&s;elves in &s;ome convenient &s;ituation, near that town, be|fore the concour&s;e of <HI>&s;ick and gay,</HI> who are gene|rally &s;o oddly coupled, at all Spa's, might ren|der our accommodation difficult, or inconve|nient. He readily accepted my propo&s;al, and after I had &s;et off my hou&s;e, and di&s;po&s;ed of the furniture, by auction, we &s;et out together for this country.</P>
<P>Before I left London, I &s;ent my dear children back again to Hertford&s;hire, with my good friend the clergyman; to whom, at parting, I made a pre&s;ent of a &s;elect collection of books, value about two hundred pounds; which had devolved to my father, from his father and brother, who were both of them per&s;ons of learning, and had formed their libraries with judgment and care.</P>
<P>I al&s;o wrote an invitation to Mr. Beville, at Wind&s;or, to come and re&s;ide with us at Scar|borough, during the &s;ea&s;on; and then to accept of an apartment in whatever man&s;ion I might afterwards fix my&s;elf, during our joint lives. He wrote me an an&s;wer, full of acknowledgments,
<PB N="255" REF="282">
and promi&s;ed to follow us, as &s;oon as he could &s;ell the intere&s;t of his hou&s;e and parks, at Wind|&s;or, and di&s;po&s;e of his other effects.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="93" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XCIII.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend and I took lodgings at Scarbo|rough, and about a month after, old Mr. Beville came to us, with a debenture of five hundred pounds, which he had reali&s;ed out of the remnants of his reduced fortune. He was very ill on his arrival, langui&s;hed for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t expired of a broken heart, as he con|fe&s;&s;ed, occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of his wife, and his daughter, together with that of his fortune.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had got to Scarborough, I be|gan to inquire whether there was any place to be let, near the town; for I liked this country extremely well, as we rode through it; and the purpo&s;e, which had occurred to my mind, at London, was now framed into a kind of re&s;olu|tion, of &s;ettling my&s;elf &s;omewhere hereabout.</P>
<P>The only counties I had ever any acquaint|ance with, were Berk&s;hire, and Hertford&s;hire; and being now &s;elf-bani&s;hed from the&s;e, all other places had become quite equal to me. But
<PB N="256" REF="283">
this one had obtained a preference, in my elec|tion, upon my dear friend's account, becau&s;e of its extreme di&s;tance from the &s;till too charming Ethelinda's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>I was informed of &s;everal hou&s;es and farms to be let, and rode out to &s;ee them; but as none of them happened to be &s;ituated near the &s;ea, I de|clined them all. I con&s;idered, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, that they could not accommodate my friend, with regard to one part of his pre&s;crip|tion; and I confe&s;s al&s;o, that in the &s;econd, I had all my life the highe&s;t reli&s;h for &s;ea-pro&s;pects, and a de&s;ire to fix my&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ituation near the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething extremely awful and com|manding in a view of the ocean, which enlarges our ideas far beyond the riche&s;t land&s;cape; and in the contemplation of its u&s;es, properties, movements, and contents, our minds and hearts become naturally elevated toward the greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s of Providence, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But I own that there is another &s;entiment, much &s;tronger than this, which had always in|duced me to &s;uch a choice of &s;ituation; and it is this, that I might po&s;&s;ibly have the good for|tune, after &s;ome horrid &s;torm, of &s;upplying re|lief to &s;ome poor &s;hip-wrecked voyagers, and of defending them al&s;o, from the &s;avage cruelties,
<PB N="257" REF="284">
and inhumanities, too frequently exerci&s;ed by the greedy and lawle&s;s pea&s;ants, upon all coa&s;ts, again&s;t &s;uch unhappy objects of real di&s;tre&s;s, and commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>At length, I fixed upon this charming &s;pot; the rent of which farm was con&s;iderably abated, on account of its not having the accommodation of a hou&s;e or offices upon it. Which con&s;idera|tion being computed, and added to the &s;avings of alterations and repairs, brings the expences of this building, almo&s;t within a &s;aving upon the preference.</P>
<P>I commenced this hou&s;e on the fir&s;t day of March la&s;t, and, as it was con&s;tructed with brick and wain&s;cot, it was rendered habitable by the fir&s;t day of this month, July, when I en|tered into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and &s;hall very pro|bably here fix my &s;tation, for the remainder of my life.</P>

<P>WHEN Mr. Andrews had brought his &s;tory to a conclu&s;ion, Mr. Carewe made him a great many acknowledgments for the high entertainment it had afforded him. He &s;aid that there were a great many intere&s;ting events, in the&s;e memoirs, even to an hearer; but as a friend, added he, I could mo&s;t &s;in|cerely have wi&s;hed that they had been le&s;s rich of incidents, by two very affecting particulars.</P>
<P>My &s;tory, continued he, which by agreement you are intitled to exact, will by no means re|turn you the &s;ame amu&s;ement, either in kind, or degree. You are not to expect from me, a continued &s;eries; my life has been too di&s;&s;i|pated and extempore, to afford much chain, and may rather be &s;tiled a collection of incidents, than a connection of events.</P>
<P>I have been generally too much an <HI>individual</HI> of &s;ociety, and, till a late cri&s;is&mdash;whether happy, or unfortunate, added he, with a &s;igh, remains yet within the womb of time&mdash;there was not any per&s;on in the world, who could either di|rect, or govern, give a con&s;i&s;tent tenor, or &s;teady purpo&s;e, to my life and actions; which
<PB N="259" REF="286">
for the matter of them, and following after your's and Mr. Beville's, may be con&s;idered as a lively epilogue, or a merry farce, after a mov|ing tragedy.</P>
<P>My dear Carewe, replied Mr. Andrews, the mo&s;t trifling particulars, relating to one friend, are intere&s;ting to another. Their pa&s;|&s;ions, their affections the &s;ame, namely, a mu|tual re&s;entment of each other's pains and plea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>But this is a treat which I mu&s;t not churli&s;hly enjoy alone. We have &s;ecluded my dear Beville long enough from our retired conver&s;e, already; and if you will be &s;o kind as to &s;uffer him to form <HI>a triumvirate</HI> with us, in our mutual confi|dence and friend&s;hip, it will double my plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, by affording to that unhappy man, &s;ome kind of amu&s;ement and relief from his too fatal pa&s;&s;ion; which, in &s;pite of time, ab&s;ence, philo&s;ophy, and virtue, &s;eems &s;till to ingro&s;s too much his whole heart, mind, and affections.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t cordially agree to your propo&s;al, my dear Andrews, an&s;wered Mr. Carewe, for I &s;hould think my&s;elf but half your friend, were I not wholly his. Nor do I, in the lea&s;t, appre|hend that the admitting this very worthy per&s;on a third in our union of &s;ouls, can in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ort
<PB N="260" REF="287">
dimini&s;h our own mutual fondne&s;s toward each other; but that we may then be con&s;idered, rather as a <HI>triangle,</HI> who&s;e <HI>angles,</HI> though they exceed not the quantity of two <HI>right ones,</HI> &s;erve however, by this divi&s;ion, to &s;trengthen and &s;upport each other.</P>
<P>When Mr. Beville had returned from the Spa, he was made acquainted with this plan of amu&s;e|ment, and received the motion with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction; for he had conceived an high e&s;teem and affection for Mr. Carewe, from the &s;tory of his adventure with Mr. Andrews, which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with a fond and generous concern in the &s;malle&s;t matters which related to him.</P>
<P>He therefore returned thanks to Mr. Carewe, for his kind concurrence with Mr. Andrews's propo|&s;al; and, in order to leave Mr. Beville &s;till at liberty to continue his cour&s;e of bathing, their future evenings were fixed upon for this enter|tainment. Accordingly, after dinner, that day, Mr. Carewe commenced his memoir; as you will find it written in the &s;econd volume.</P>

<P>What are <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi</HI>'s, or any of the modern treati&s;es on morals, but extracts, or paraphra&s;es on the <HI>Enchiridion,</HI> on <HI>Seneca,</HI> or <HI>Tully?</HI> Or Derham's phy&s;ics, but compilations, or com|pendiums of <HI>Galileo, Boyle, De&s;cartes,</HI> or <HI>New|ton?</HI> Works of learning, and labour, indeed, but not of talents, or genius.</P>
<P>A per&s;on well grounded in a college cour&s;e, has, at pre&s;ent, nothing new to read, except a very few writings of wit, or humour; and yet, books are printed, or rather <HI>reprinted,</HI> every day, which but vary or tran&s;po&s;e the pages written in former centuries; and only &s;erve to puzzle and ob&s;truct all &s;cience, by opening dif|ferent avenues to the &s;ame point, and by in|ducing &s;tudents to imagine the <HI>Encyclopoedia</HI> to
<PB N="263" REF="290">
be more tedious, and difficult, than in reality it is.</P>
<P>In fine, we may venture to pronounce that the wi&s;e&s;t man, even at pre&s;ent, as was once &s;aid by a learned antient, is <HI>he who has read the fewe&s;t books</HI>&mdash;provided he has but cho&s;en them well. For learning, beyond certain limits, but dulls the genius, confounds the intellect, and multi|plies &s;tudy, without increa&s;ing knowledge.</P>
<P>If an ingenious &s;ociety of men would take the trouble of making a <HI>critical review</HI> of the <HI>Mega Biblion,</HI> or <HI>tautology</HI> of learning, and reduce it all into a <HI>dige&s;t,</HI> I dare affirm that the whole com|pa&s;s of &s;cience, phy&s;ical, philo&s;ophical, theo|logical, political, metaphy&s;ical, and moral; taking in the cla&s;&s;ics and poetics, in all lan|guages; with all hi&s;tory that is worth reading, for knowledge, &s;tile, or ob&s;ervation, would not compo&s;e a library exceeding the purcha&s;e of fifty pounds; and the whole &s;tudy might be com|prehended, within a &s;even years college cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But then indeed, I &s;hall confe&s;s that there mu&s;t be an intire reform al&s;o, among the pro|fe&s;&s;ors in each &s;everal branch, with regard to their pre&s;ent prolix method of in&s;truction. For the proverb of <HI>ars longa</HI> &s;hould be more properly changed to <HI>artifices lenti</HI> And the rapid pro|gre&s;s which &s;ome extraordinary, and uneducated
<PB N="264" REF="291">
per&s;ons have been reported to have made in the arts and &s;ciences, might have been owing to their having in&s;tructed them&s;elves more by <HI>rea|&s;on,</HI> than by <HI>rule.</HI></P>
<P>Nor would this &s;cheme be of the lea&s;t di&s;ad|vantage to the world in general; for though &s;ome laborious dunces might by this means, perhaps, want bread, unle&s;s much better employed in &s;owing and reaping it, yet the u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary trades of printers, book&s;ellers, and &s;ta|tioners, would &s;till continue to thrive, even bet|ter than before. For there would then be a thou&s;and libraries, for one we have, at pre&s;ent; as men are often di&s;couraged from making col|lections, for want of proper catalogues to direct them where to begin, and where to end.</P>
<P>I know many per&s;ons of fortune who have not five pounds worth of books in their &s;tudies, at pre&s;ent, and tho&s;e picked up by chance, or inheritance, and who would not give five &s;hil|lings for five pounds worth more, and yet would readily lay out fifty, to purcha&s;e a <HI>compleat li|brary;</HI> which, if once pointed out, and a&s;cer|tained, would be then deemed one of the appen|dages of fortune and grandeur, even to tho&s;e who cannot read, as many furni&s;h &s;tables of hor&s;es, which they cannot ride.</P>
