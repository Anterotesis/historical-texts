<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS not initiated in the Science of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, until I was introduced to the Augu&s;tin Convent at Paris, where the cele|brated Father Harvier, attended daily a great num|ber of patients, of every rank and degree, gratis. I was in&s;tantly &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment by the Mag|netical Somnambuli&s;m, which I &s;aw con&s;tantly per|forming before crouds of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and dignified clergy, who a&s;&s;embled every day, all of whom were thoroughly convinced that the art was practi&s;ed by men of integrity, without any deceit. I was &s;oon after pre&s;ented to the famous and learned Marquis de Puy&s;egur, and to &s;everal other noble|men, di&s;tingui&s;hed in the literary world; who took delight in &s;hewing tho&s;e phenomena to their friends. Scarcely had I acquired a knowledge of the &s;cience, before I put one per&s;on in a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, which made me exult on the &s;ucce&s;s, as my tutors in the &s;cience were pre&s;ent, viz. General Meziere, Chevalier Ju&s;tamond, who encouraged me to per&s;e|vere. I na little time I produced numbers, who in that &s;tate an&s;wered my que&s;tions; found out the di&s;ea&s;es of the people pre&s;ent, and pre&s;cribed infallible cures for them; they are called Malade Medecin, con|cerning whom I &s;hall &s;peak at large, in my Treati&s;e upon the Doctrine of Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>That it is practicable to put certain per&s;ons into this &s;tate, need be no longer doubted, without touch|ing or giving them any previous operation. It is a matter &s;trange to per&s;ons unacquainted with the &s;ci|ence, but that will vani&s;h when the mind receives in&s;truction and becomes familiar with it; in order to the attainment of which, I invite all per&s;ons of every &s;ex, rank and degree, to come, &s;ee, and judge for them&s;elves. I &s;hall &s;oon publi&s;h one Number on Theory, and another on the Practice.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE PROBABILITIES OF Electrical and Magnetical Somnambules, OR SLEEP-WALKERS.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the novelties which are created by Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, Somnambuli&s;m is, doubtle&s;s, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>By Somnambuli&s;m is meant that peculiar &s;tate when the &s;en&s;es are &s;u&s;pended between &s;leeping and waking; partak|ing of both, and is al&s;o productive of many phoenomena, which each are &s;trangers to.</P>
<P>The patient being reduced to a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, without touching him, is deaf to all that is near him: Motionle&s;s amid&s;t the greate&s;t motions; he &s;eems &s;eparated from nature, as if it were, to communicate only with the per&s;on who put him into that &s;tate.</P>
<P>The latter, owing to Magneti&s;ation alone, has an inti|mate analogy with the patient; by the means of a kind of an invi&s;ible leaver, he cau&s;es him to move at his plea&s;ure; and &s;uch is the power of his influence, that he not only makes him&s;elf under&s;tood by &s;peaking and &s;igns, but even by the very thought it&s;elf; and what is &s;till more extraor|dinary, the Magneti&s;er can, by a &s;ingle contract, commu|nicate
<PB N="6" REF="6">his faculty to other people; and from that moment there is a con&s;tant communication between the Somnambule and his new director.</P>
<P>The patient being put into a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, there is in him a want of organization, which breaks the equili|brium of his &s;en&s;es; &s;o that &s;ome experience an extreme degradation, whil&s;t others acquire a prodigious degree of &s;ubtlety.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ome have their hearing entirely lo&s;t or weakened, and their &s;ight becomes prodigiou&s;ly penetrating. In others, the privation, both of &s;ight and hearing, are amply com|pen&s;ated by an incredible delicacy both of feeling and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>And in many, a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e appears to declare it&s;elf by an extreme extent of the intellectual faculty, far &s;uperior to the common altitude of the human mind.</P>
<P>In a word, the phoenomena, attending on the &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, daily offer new &s;ubjects of a&s;toni&s;hment, even to tho&s;e who ought to be more fami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iar with them.</P>
<P>It remains to con&s;ider, whether tho&s;e pretended phoeno|mena are &s;uch as is propagated; or, whether on the contrary, they are nothing the but illu&s;ions, kept up by the impo&s;ition of &s;ome ill de&s;igned per&s;ons and the credulity of others.</P>
<P>For it is well known that the human mind, naturally bent towards every thing marvellous, eagerly &s;eizes on whatever is flattering to the ta&s;te; and there are exalted geniu&s;&s;es to be found that employ both their head and talents to realize mere chimeras.</P>
<P>Among the per&s;ons who have been witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ingu|larities attending on Somnambuli&s;m, &s;ome &s;truck with a&s;to|ni&s;hment and admiration, have given full credit to its influ|ence, and look on it as an irre&s;i&s;tible proof of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P>Others, though convinced of the reality of its phoenomena, are yet incredulous with regard to the cau&s;e which produced them. They had rather &s;uppo&s;e in this affair &s;ome &s;ecret &s;pring productive of illu&s;ions; and, though incapable of comprehending tho&s;e means of intelligence, they have, neverthele&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed their exi&s;tence; alledging, for exam|ple, tho&s;e cunning tricks which a &s;ubtle philo&s;opher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Caumus and Pinetty.</NOTE> made u&s;e to a&s;toni&s;h all Paris and London during many years.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>As to the Phy&s;icians, mo&s;t of them have di&s;dained to prove witne&s;&s;es to the e&s;&s;ects of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m, under the pretence that it was &s;ufficient for them &s;uch a phoenomenon was contrary to tho&s;e notions con&s;ecrated in phy&s;ic and phy&s;iology; they have con&s;idered tho&s;e pretended marvels as mere chimeras unworthy a &s;erious examination.</P>
<P>There was even a learned body who went &s;o far as to for|bid their members to entertain the lea&s;t doubt on the &s;ubject, and expelled from their &s;ociety whom&s;oever have given them&s;elves up to the &s;tudy of this new doctrine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A decree of the faculty of Paris, 1784, which is the &s;ame as they did for inoculation, which is now adopted by them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, on the other hand, Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m becomes daily more and more con&s;i&s;tent; a great number of people remarkable for their learning, probity, found judg|ment and &s;agacity, certify beyond a doubt the reality of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m; and that contradiction of re|&s;pectable authorities on both &s;ides, leave the public in &s;u&s;|pence, who, to take a deci&s;ive part in the conte&s;t, impati|ently wait until the matter is more fully inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>The following impartial reflections may &s;erve to fix the opinion of impartial people on the &s;ubject of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m. To treat this object with the more &s;ucce&s;s, I think it is nece&s;&s;ary to divide the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion into three parts.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t point to be con&s;idered, is to know, in fact, the public have been witne&s;&s;es of phoenomena of &s;ome impor|tance, well de&s;erving to excite their curio&s;ity, and of which the cau&s;e ought to be inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>Secondly, &s;uppo&s;e the effects &s;poken of de&s;erved to be enquired into, it is proper to examine whether they cannot rea&s;onably be &s;u&s;pected of artifice.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, admitting it impo&s;&s;ible to find out the artifice, it will remain to examine whether they are contrary to com|mon notions already received.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Are Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m phoenomena of &s;uch an importance as to de&s;erve the curio&s;ity of both the public and the learned?</P>
<P>The object of this que&s;tion is, I believe, very plain and obvious; I mean to &s;ay, that previou&s;ly to our being at the trouble of examining whether Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m be an illu&s;ion, or reality, we mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h, that, there
<PB N="8" REF="8">exi&s;t, at lea&s;t &s;eemingly, &s;ome &s;ingularities which concern both the public good and the improvement of learning.</P>
<P>Many people, however, might have a right to doubt it, becau&s;e they had no occa&s;ion to know the truth of the a&s;&s;er|tion. They have a right to require to be &s;atisfied, previ|ou&s;ly to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the two following propo&s;itions, viz. <Q>"That there are either at Paris, Dublin, &amp;c. in the provin|ces, or any where el&s;e &s;ome people, who being naturally forced into a &s;tate of &s;leep, really offer the phoenomena which we are about to examine."</Q></P>
<P>For if it was not certain that &s;uch a &s;cene is not to be met with &s;omewhere, it would be a lo&s;s of time to enquire into its principle.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, a preliminary obligation for any body el&s;e, to e&s;tabli&s;h well the exi&s;tence of Magnetical Somnam|buli&s;m, whether right or wrong.</P>
<P>This point was, for a long time, a matter of general incredulity. They plainly denied that there were any &s;uch individuals exi&s;ting any where, and the very di&s;cour&s;e held on the &s;ubject, was looked upon merely as a fable to amu&s;e the public.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t writing, which treated of Magnetical Somnam|buli&s;ts, was, if I am not mi&s;taken, a letter from Mr. Cloquet, payma&s;ter of rents at Soi&s;&s;ons, who, relating what he had &s;een at Buzanci's treatment, by the Marquis de Puy&s;egur, in&s;inuated &s;omething which &s;eemed to characteri&s;e Magne|tical Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>Since that letter, a gentleman, who&s;e candor is above all &s;u&s;picion, has con&s;igned in a writing, which is, in every re&s;pect, intere&s;ting, &s;everal phoenomena he had ob&s;erved in Puz&oacute;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nei's treatment, &s;till more wonderful than tho&s;e which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Cloquet had given a &s;ketch of.</P>
<P>The peru&s;al of this performance having in&s;pired &s;ome people of the fir&s;t rank with the eager de&s;ire of being wit|ne&s;&s;es to a like Somnambuli&s;m, the author of the above found an opportunity of gratifying their curio&s;ity at Paris, in the winter of 1785.</P>
<P>More than 5000 people have been at liberty to &s;ee tho&s;e phoenomena true or fal&s;e, of which notice was taken both in the national and foreign prints. The&s;e Somnambules un|derwent repeated trials, which all met with more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned, many more were made at Paris, or in &s;ome other provinces. This Somnambuli&s;m example having induced the Magneti&s;ers to adhere to that part of Magneti&s;m, they applied them&s;elves to it with more zeal, as it &s;eemed to be a &s;ure way towards a remedy. Thus, the concern of Magneti&s;m, and that of the patient, uniting both to pre&s;cribe that mode of proceeding, it is become the common object of all Magneti&s;ers attempts, and in all treatment they gloried in &s;hewing &s;ome patient more or le&s;s improved.</P>
<P>It is evident then that there exi&s;ts many individuals &s;truck with a &s;eeming Somnambuli&s;m; and I begin to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the que&s;tion, in order to proceed methodically, after &s;ettling con&s;tant and notorious facts, which might lead to infallible con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It is then certain and indi&s;putable, that there are pre|tended Somnambules, which offer wonderful phoenomena to the &s;pectators, as compen&s;ative gratification for excited curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now, the que&s;tion is to know what opinion we &s;hould form concerning tho&s;e Somnambules; if it be not a feigned &s;tate, by the means of which they endeavour to impo&s;e on the credulity of tho&s;e whom they are &s;urrounded by.</P>
<P N="2">2d. How far are Magnetical Somnambules to be be|lieved?</P>
<P>Among the Somnambules I am here &s;peaking of, I do not include that multitude of per&s;ons of both &s;exes among the common people, <HI>who are to be &s;een at &s;ome impo&s;tors,</HI> and may rea&s;onably be &s;u&s;pected to perform Somnambuli&s;m, through imitation, or to make them&s;elves intere&s;ting, and others who are paid for it.</P>
<P>It is a misfortune, con&s;tantly attending on good things, that they can never be pre&s;erved in their native purity, nor e&s;cape that mixture which malice or cupidity &s;eldom fail to blend with them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who, either through prejudice or intere&s;t, endea|vour to di&s;play the di&s;covery, take care to examine it on that &s;ide only, which &s;eems to convey an idea of apparent quackery, and never fail to pre&s;ent it to the public in that view.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who &s;incerely wi&s;h for information, pay but little regard to &s;uch a con&s;ideration, and throwing a&s;ide quackery and exaggerations, carefully penetrate as far as the
<PB N="10" REF="10">principle it&s;elf. Thus, a botani&s;t, de&s;irous of procuring the fruit of an Almond to be enabled to di&s;cern its true quality, is not di&s;couraged by the putrid fle&s;h which &s;ur|rounds it; but chearfully lopping all nau&s;eous &s;uperfluities, he finds at la&s;t the fruit which is to be the rule of his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>In that manner &s;hould every unbia&s;&s;ed man act, who &s;incerely &s;eeks for truth, without having intere&s;t or de&s;ign to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Let us contemptuou&s;ly di&s;regard tho&s;e &s;u&s;picious apparent Somnambules, and attend to tho&s;e who, by their civil exi&s;t|ence, their character, manner, &amp;c. are above &s;u&s;picion; and in whom, be&s;ides Somnambuli&s;m, the &s;cience is por|trayed, and brought to the highe&s;t degree of perfection.</P>
<P>I think tho&s;e ought to be cho&s;en among patients, in whom Somnambuli&s;m appears to be in a higher degree of perfec|tion, and &s;uch a caution is, in my opinion, very material.</P>
<P>In fact, the more imperfect the Somnambule is, the ea&s;ier it is to impo&s;e; if he badly an&s;wers your &s;igns, and follows your motions in an untoward and ill contrived manner, he apologizes by &s;aying he is not, as yet, arrived to a &s;tate of perfect Somnambuli&s;m, and the ob&s;ervator, who really conceives that &s;uch a &s;tate mu&s;t have its degrees, is puzzled, on account of his not knowing whether the bad &s;ucce&s;s he has experienced is to be attributed to the untowardne&s;s of the Somnambule, or the imperfection of his &s;tate.</P>
<P>But when I fix on a Somnambule, recommended as a perfect being, it is evident that this ta&s;k is very painful. In that ca&s;e, there is neither excu&s;e nor pretence; the ob&s;er|vator is ea&s;y, and Somnambuli&s;m has a trial to undergo, which is to prove either his &s;hame or his triumph.</P>
<P>Such perfect Somnambules have not been wanting la&s;t year in France; and among tho&s;e who have tried my expe|riments, there is one with whom I &s;taid more than half an hour, and who has before me, and at my plea&s;ure, executed &s;uch motions as I pre&s;cribed him.</P>
<P>Being at my own di&s;po&s;al, without witne&s;&s;es and contra|dictors, left nothing untried to di&s;cover the fraud, if there had been in the ca&s;e; but the &s;wiftne&s;s of his evolutions, the preci&s;ion of his movements, a va&s;t number of facts which it would be too tedious to relate, di&s;concerted all my at|tempts.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<P>Many other experiments, which had their intended effects with regard to other perfect Somnambules, have all given me the &s;ame &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>There are at Paris, and in the provinces, more than 600 per&s;ons, who are in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>Therefore, to overthrow the con&s;equences re&s;ulting from &s;uch experiments, there is no other re&s;ource left, but to per&s;evere in giving out that it was a deceitful trick on the part of Somnambules.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition carries with it the greate&s;t difficul|ties, and is accompanied by improbabilities &s;till more &s;hock|ing than Somnambuli&s;m it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To admit that the phoenomena in que&s;tion are the re&s;ult of impo&s;ition, two things are ab&s;olutely required:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. Somnambules mu&s;t have an intention of deceiving.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. They mu&s;t be endowed with an addre&s;s to do it. But, we mu&s;t fir&s;t confe&s;s, that, among tho&s;e who have already been or are daily in&s;pired with Somnambuli&s;m, there are many above all kind of &s;u&s;picion. They are re&s;pectable women of family, men of &s;tability and known integrity, people of a plain and &s;imple turn of mind, children, &amp;c. in whom we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e to exi&s;t any de&s;ign or intere&s;t, to &s;eign a like &s;ituation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Should they be led by any faction, or the intention of per|forming Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m with any &s;eem|ing reality? But mo&s;t of them have no concern at all, as to the fortune of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m; nay, many of them had no notion of it at the moment they were confirming Magnetical &s;leep.</P>
<P>Shall it be &s;aid, that, it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of tho&s;e indivi|duals are encouraged by the parti&s;ans of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, and that they are but a mere in&s;trument in the hands of the latter to favour the &s;ucce&s;s of that &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>But, for what purpo&s;e &s;hould the parti&s;ans of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m have recour&s;e to &s;o capricious a &s;tratagem? The &s;uppo&s;ition, would, at the be&s;t, be ad|mi&s;&s;ible, if Somnambuli&s;m had originally been announced as a nece&s;&s;ary effect of Magneti&s;m; &s;o that they mu&s;t have been forced to re&s;ign Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m, had they been deprived of the re&s;ource tendered them by Somnambuli&s;m: but the ca&s;e is very different.</P>
<P>Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m was originally an|nounced without the attendance of Somnambuli&s;m. This
<PB N="12" REF="12">&s;ingularity is a later di&s;covery, the re&s;ult of the habitual practice of Magneti&s;m. Even now, there are many Magne|ti&s;ers who do not look on Somnambuli&s;m as being an effen|tial part of the &s;cience, but only as an acce&s;&s;ary which may indifferently be united to, or &s;eparated from Magneti&s;m.</P>
<P>From whence it plainly follows, that if the parti&s;ans of Animal Electricity and Magneti&s;m were in want of a re|&s;ource to impo&s;e on the public, &s;urely they mu&s;t have been very de&s;titute of penetration to embrace &s;o &s;trange a manoeuvre, which carried with it a prodigious complication of &s;prings, and in&s;uperable difficulties in its execution.</P>
<P>And, that had it been an artifice, it would have been &s;ufficient to deter every hone&s;t man from entering or a&s;&s;oci|ating with it.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t then, have only dealt with, and cho&s;en peo|ple of profligate manners, and of the wor&s;t &s;ort, to inve&s;t them with that confidence, at the ri&s;k of &s;eeing it betrayed, and made public on the very next day. That is not all, they mu&s;t have found in tho&s;e individuals an extraordinary ad|dre&s;s to act &s;o difficult a part, and deceive the experiments of an enlightened and incredulous people, at who&s;e tribunal appearance mu&s;t be made.</P>
<P>Had things been thus tran&s;acted, Somnambuli&s;m could not have la&s;ted long, and far from gaining credit, time would &s;oon have di&s;covered the illu&s;ion and deceit, by the difficulty of finding actors capable of perpetrating the impo&s;ture. But the contrary has happened; every day Somnambuli&s;m gets new parti&s;ans, and the credit which it con&s;tantly ob|tains, parti&s;ans, and the credit which it con&s;tantly ob|tains, plainly contradicts every idea of deceit.</P>
<P>Patients are daily &s;een in that condition, in the very bo&s;om of their family, under the in&s;pection of their neare&s;t rela|tions, and tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t intere&s;ted to verify their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Who could believe that &s;uch patients, &s;urrounded with the very horrors of death and mo&s;t painful &s;ufferings, could di&s;&s;emble for the &s;ole intere&s;t of Magneti&s;m? Their relations, fathers, hu&s;bands, wives, children&mdash;are they then concerned in the piot?</P>
<P>Shall it be &s;aid that their illne&s;s is feigned? It is another &s;uppo&s;ition no le&s;s admi&s;&s;ible; for be&s;ides that it is no ea&s;y matter to feign a malignant fever, a fiuxion, drop&s;y, and other di&s;ea&s;es of that kind, there are &s;ome &s;o well averred
<PB N="13" REF="13">that no man in his &s;en&s;es could po&s;&s;ibly doubt their exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration may be added here, that is, even in &s;uppo&s;ing that a healthy man could long act the part of a &s;ick man, or the patient take upon him&s;elf to act the Som|nambule; and, that people hidden before the curtain, &s;hould pre&s;ide over this mummery, I maintain would be impo&s;&s;ible in the execution; and whatever addre&s;s may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t on both &s;ides, the deceit mu&s;t &s;oon be di&s;covered, and, indeed, after a few moments, I would defy the mo&s;t nim|ble buffoon, the mo&s;t expert of all, and the mo&s;t inured to bodily exerci&s;es, to a&s;&s;ect Somnambuli&s;m before &s;cientific per&s;ons, or execute any &s;uch thing as is ob&s;erved among the Somnambules, whom I am now treating of. I defy any one to remain during eight or ten hours, having his eyes &s;hut, and his eyelids quite clo&s;e together, without one eyelid &s;e|parating from the other during that period of time. Such a per&s;everance &s;eems to be much above the reach of human power and patience. Who is the man that could remain five or &s;ix hours in a motionle&s;s attitude, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ation of what pa&s;&s;es round him, inacce&s;&s;ible to every emotion, and all the &s;udden and unfore&s;een &s;hocks of noi&s;e which his attention &s;hall, at periods, be gratified with? Who is that hi&s;trion, &s;ubtle enough to imitate, with his eyes clo&s;ely &s;hut, the different &s;igns which will be pre&s;ented him, and de&s;cribe the lines which will be traced with a ju&s;t|ne&s;s and acutene&s;s, that no interval &s;hall be found between the order and the compliance. A few experiments of this nature would be &s;ufficient to di&s;courage the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate Saltimbank, and make him give up his undertaking in two hours time.</P>
<P>Now, when we &s;ee the &s;ame effects con&s;tantly repeated, without the lea&s;t effort, and multiplied in the pre&s;ence of a prodigious number of per&s;ons of all &s;exes, age, and rank, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily acknowledge that they act through a natural impul&s;e, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art: for it is well known that nature can ea&s;ily perfect what is impo&s;&s;ible for art to execute.</P>
<P>Thus, phy&s;ical probabilities concur with moral ones to e&s;tabli&s;h the reality of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m.&mdash;Som|nambuli&s;m cannot be rejected, without &s;uppo&s;ing it a deceit too palpable to credit, and in whatever manner you act, it will prove a phoenomenon, either moral or phy&s;ical; and I
<PB N="14" REF="14">confe&s;s the latter is, by far, ea&s;ier to be conceived than the former; for a natural phoenomenon, after all, is &s;u&s;cepti|ble of an explanation; and the plot of a deceit, without in|tere&s;t and motive whatever, is no le&s;s complicated in its execution.</P>
<P>A number of people are to be found over whom &s;uch con|&s;iderations, &s;triking as they are, can never triumph. What|ever difficulties may be encountered with, to make tho&s;e &s;tratagems &s;ucceed, they &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch an addre&s;s takes place, becau&s;e they &s;ay in the things hurtful to rea&s;on, the authority of te&s;timonies is of no value.</P>
<P>That evident impo&s;&s;ibility is a kind of re&s;entment on that part of the public who have not &s;een the phoenomena in que&s;|tion, and in&s;pire tho&s;e who have actually &s;een them, with a certain degree of diffidence.</P>
<P>If a common fact, con&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;ual proceedings of nature, was only agitated, it is in general confe&s;&s;ed, that there would be more proofs than requi&s;ite to e&s;tabli&s;h its credit, on bare words and without having &s;een it. But as to a phoenomenon, &s;o little con&s;i&s;tent with nature, which is neither explicable nor conceivable, and overthrows all re|ceived notions, we are authori&s;ed not only to refu&s;e the te&s;|timony of others, but even that of our own &s;en&s;es. It is after &s;uch an ab&s;urdity that many learned have been heard to &s;ay, "That they would not believe it if they &s;aw it."</P>
<P>Now then it remains to con&s;ider, whether Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m, and the &s;everal phoenomena u&s;ually attend|ing on it, are as inconceivable as tho&s;e gentlemen would in&s;inuate.</P>
<P>Are Magnetical Somnambuli&s;ms phoenomena repugnant to the order of nature?</P>
<P>Phy&s;icians by affecting the greate&s;t incredulity in Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m, under the mere pretence that &s;uch phoenomenon is inconceivable, give no &s;atisfactory account of their di&s;belief, becau&s;e, that the identical diffi|culty they attempt to condemn, cannot withhold the victori|ous te&s;timonies which militate in favour of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>The difficulty of conceiving a phoenomenon, by no mean de&s;troys its reality; we are &s;urrounded with a multitude of natural marvels, which no one has the lea&s;t doubt about, though they are incomprehen&s;ible; for it is evident that
<PB N="15" REF="15">nature has pre&s;cribed certain limits which are inacce&s;&s;ible to human conception.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, &s;ome will &s;ay, <Q>"From &s;uch a mode of rea&s;oning it will then follow that we mu&s;t give credit to every ab&s;urdity we hear, and believe the greate&s;t oddities in the world; and tho&s;e who will exact &s;uch a belief, &s;hall only have to invoke the great power of nature, and the immen&s;e extent of its re&s;ources.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That way of rea&s;oning would deprive arts of their rules, and bani&s;h principles from &s;ciences, in order to make room for ra&s;h a&s;&s;ertions, &amp;c. our learning, in&s;tead of being &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement and enlargement, would fall again into chaos and confu&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>But that objection is, by no means applicable; for the que&s;tion is not to admit a phoenomenon under the &s;ingle con|&s;ideration that nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to nature; it is, on the contrary, recommended that we &s;hould &s;ubmit to the trial of contradiction, experience, and rea&s;oning it&s;elf, a fact certified by a multitude of per&s;ons of every denomination who have been eye witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus, till now, pre&s;umption is &s;till in favour of Somnam|buli&s;m, &s;ince being grounded on the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;idera|tions; tho&s;e con&s;iderations are neither overcome nor weak|ened by the pretended improbability urged again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But what will then be &s;aid, if we were to di&s;cover that Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m? far from offering to the learned an inconceivable phoenomenon, incompatible with all notions admitted both in phy&s;ic and phy&s;iology; it is on the contrary, a natural con&s;equence from tho&s;e very principles, acce&s;&s;ary of the common notions with which it is blended and united in a very natural manner?</P>
<P>It is what I propo&s;e to demon&s;trate, and in order to proceed methodically, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively examine the two articles of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m, which have ex|cited the reclamation of the doctors. 1&s;t. The facility of putting a patient in a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m. 2d. The phoenomena u&s;ually attending on &s;uch a &s;tate.</P>
<P>Article 1&s;t. The Somnambuli&s;m's communication is in the order of the already admitted notions in phy&s;i|ology.</P>
<P>It is &s;omething remarkable to hear many learned men ob|&s;tinately declare it to be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for a patient to be put in a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, by any art whatever,
<PB N="16" REF="16">when we con&s;ider that it is one of the favourite maxims in phy&s;ic, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art all natural revolutions may be imitated in the human body. It is on that principle that the parti&s;ans of inoculation chiefly relied to defend both the practice and &s;ucce&s;s of that proceeding.</P>
<P>All phy&s;icians agree, that the art of inoculation con&s;i&s;ts in preventing by a factitious indi&s;po&s;ition in an individual, the real one which nature would have &s;oon or late oc|ca&s;ioned.</P>
<P>It is &s;till according to the &s;ame maxim, that phy&s;icians attempt to inoculate many kinds of di&s;tempers, either to prevent them, or to make them &s;erve as a counterpoi&s;e to other di&s;ea&s;es; and now the art of curing one di&s;ea&s;e by another, is e&s;teemed in medicine as a compleat knowledge of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e being thus, and &s;ince it is acknowledged that na|ture is liable to imitation, by introducing &s;uch or &s;uch maladies in the human body, is it &s;o &s;trange, &s;o inconceiv|able, that Somnambuli&s;m &s;hould al&s;o be tran&s;mi&s;&s;ible through artificial means?</P>
<P>Somnambuli&s;m is by phy&s;icians entitled a di&s;ea&s;e; it is, therefore, in that quality as in the number of tho&s;e revolu|tions which the power of art introduces. To that effect one more &s;tep is to be made in the career of di&s;tempers, and ino|culation: but &s;uch an exten&s;ion, far from contradicting the principles of phy&s;iology, only confirms them.</P>
<P>It is expected, however, that phy&s;icians will oppo&s;e this &s;imilitude, in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome differences and di&s;tinctions; nay, they will perhaps forget them&s;elves &s;o far as to take Somnambuli&s;m from the number of maladies, by di&s;owning their no&s;ologi&s;ts in this point.</P>
<P>That no pretence may be left for &s;ubterfuge, we &s;hall be intent on maladies and di&s;cour&s;e &s;olely on &s;leep.</P>
<P>Neither doctor, or natural philo&s;ophers, have as yet been able to explain the cau&s;e of &s;leep, nor the manner by which it is produced.</P>
<P>Whatever has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject offers nothing but mere conjectures, the work of imagination; one thing only is certain, that &s;leep comes on whenever the body is in any di&s;po&s;ition to produce it, and is put in &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art. Such is the evident effect of narcotical piants, as opium, cockle-weed, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="17">
<P>Now; if there exi&s;ts any art whatever conducive to put the body in a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing at all that Magnetical proceedings might al&s;o produce the &s;ame effect. Will they &s;ay that there is a want of &s;imilitude, becau&s;e in Magnetical proceedings neither decoctions nor infu&s;ions are employed to create &s;leep? I an&s;wer that there is no need at all to have recour&s;e either to drink, or any drug whatever, to convert any one into the &s;tate of &s;leep; the &s;ame effect is produced by a multitude of other means and proceedings; and it is even one of the particular &s;ingularities inherent to &s;leep, that it is produced by an infinitely different number of cau&s;es, and which are all contrary to each other. For ex|ample, if exce&s;&s;ive heat cau&s;es &s;leep, it is al&s;o the effect of exce&s;&s;ive cold. Soldiers have been &s;een to fall a&s;leep on the &s;now, and even peri&s;h with cold in that &s;tate of drow&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>If gentle and &s;oft friction invite to &s;leep, exqui&s;ite &s;uffer|ings act the &s;ame; which is proved by the example of tho&s;e wretches, who being put to the torture, fall a&s;leep at the very moment of their mo&s;t poignant &s;ufferings. Others are &s;aid to have yielded to &s;leep while lying on the wheel.</P>
<P>Gemelli Carreri relates, that when in China he travelled with a Tartar, who, every night, was obliged, in order to procure &s;leep, to de&s;ire &s;omebody to beat him for a while on the belly, as they do a drum.</P>
<P>Hunger and the exce&s;s of food, fatigue and re&s;t, and cool and warm refre&s;hments likewi&s;e produce &s;leep; it is al&s;o the re&s;ult of the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of the blood running in the brain. It is the effect of bathing as well as bleeding: fever, which cau&s;es in&s;omnies, likewi&s;e creates drow&s;ine&s;s; a &s;mall difference in a do&s;e of wine awakes or makes a man &s;leep. It would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k to &s;um up all the various cau&s;e, which induce man to that &s;tate; whether becau&s;e the&s;e cau&s;es produce them&s;elves, or that many different combina|tions are likewi&s;e capable of producing &s;leep, or becau&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming di&s;&s;erence, the re&s;ult is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But in both ca&s;es, one mu&s;t confe&s;s that the means productive of &s;leep are infinite, and that we are unable to determine on their nature or quality. This con&s;ideration alone, doubtle&s;s, &s;uffices to de&s;troy the improbability of a &s;leep ari&s;ing from Magnetical feelings.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e means, which at fir&s;t &s;eem &s;o extraordinary, ap|pear
<PB N="18" REF="18">far le&s;s marvellous when compared with others &s;till more &s;trange, concerning which, not a doubt can be rea|&s;onably entertained, &s;uch as tho&s;e as have ju&s;t now been mentioned.</P>
<P>The efficacy of &s;imply touching to create &s;leep, &s;eems be|&s;ides to be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, flowing from the general law of nature, that has de&s;igned the five &s;en&s;es to &s;erve as an introduction to &s;leep. If touching could not produce it, it would be the only one deprived of that faculty.</P>
<P>Indeed, if we con&s;ider but a moment the four other &s;en&s;es, hearing, &s;melling, &s;ight and ta&s;te, we &s;hall perceive in <HI>them</HI> as many conductors to &s;leep. No one can deny but the ear is a very efficacious way to &s;leep: the noi&s;e of a mill, the murmur of a river, the &s;pouting of waters, a lingering conver&s;ation, the monotony of the voice, a &s;low and melan|choly mu&s;ic organize the body, more or le&s;s quickly, in a manner fit for &s;leep.</P>
<P>The &s;mell of aromatical and narcotical plants occa&s;ions a drow&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ome chymi&s;ts have in their works given the receipt of &s;omni&s;erous e&s;&s;ences, which criminals have often abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te is another introductor to &s;leep, and medicine e&s;ta|bli&s;hes tho&s;e means in admini&s;tering narcotical phy&s;ics, either to procure &s;leep to tho&s;e who naturally want it, or to render patients in&s;en&s;ible to painful operations.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of the drugs productive of that effect, di&s;play their power, before they have been de|compo&s;ed in the &s;tomach, even before they are come down to it, merely by contract of the palate, or tongue; which plainly &s;hews that &s;uch an effect belongs to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the &s;ight is no le&s;s productive of &s;leep. Too bright a light, by inviting the eyelids to &s;hut them&s;elves, in&s;en&s;ibly encourages and cau&s;es &s;leep.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o well known how far reading contributes to in|vite &s;leep. Many people never re&s;i&s;t that impre&s;&s;ion, and even they make, upon occa&s;ion, a &s;ure re&s;ource of it.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t not be &s;aid that &s;leep is then the effect of tediou&s;en&s;s, &s;ince &s;leep is, for the mo&s;t part, involuntary, and comes on in the middle of the intere&s;ting lectures we could hear other people deliver, without feeling the lea&s;t propen&s;ity to &s;leep.</P>
<P>It is then, doubtle&s;s, &s;ight, which in that ca&s;e, &s;erves as a vehicle to &s;leep.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
<P>From whence it follows, that it is clearly proved that &s;leep comes in through five of our &s;en&s;es; now that ob&s;er|vation naturally leads us to think that touching is endowed with the like power, becau&s;e the con&s;tant uniformity which is vi&s;ible in all nature does not permit us to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;en&s;e alone would have been made particular exception of.</P>
<P>Moreover, a little reflection will &s;hew that the above fa|culty ought to belong to feeling more &s;pecially than any other &s;en&s;e. It is agreed, that, generally &s;peaking, there is but one &s;en&s;e, which is feeling, and that the other four are only a modification of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ight, hearing, ta&s;te and &s;melling produce no &s;en&s;a|tion in us but through the means of contact. The light, &s;ound, &s;avours and &s;mell only act upon us by &s;haking the nervous tufts of our organs, and &s;uch a &s;haking can never be obtained before they have touched them. This is an uncon|trovertible truth.</P>
<P>Feeling, properly &s;o called, only differs from other &s;en&s;es by its great energy and va&s;t extent. The other &s;en&s;es occu|py but a very narrow place, and are only &s;u&s;ceptible of a lo|cal impre&s;&s;ion; but feeling, by experience, is &s;pread over all the &s;urface of the body: and this is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that feeling ought to enjoy, in a &s;uperior manner, the faculty of opening a way to &s;leep: for being the chief &s;en&s;e, and almo&s;t to &s;ay the principal one, from which the others are derived, how is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive it deprived of a power which the &s;ubordinate &s;en&s;es are endowed with?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is &s;o certain that &s;leep is introduced by feeling, that the faculty pre&s;cribe opium taken in topic and applied to the &s;kin, which really produces &s;leep. The touching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may even recollect on that account manner of touching made u&s;e of in India, by which means &s;laves procure &s;leep to their ma&s;ters; which is called <HI>Ma&s;&s;er.</HI></NOTE> of an organized body may then, without any marvel, occa|&s;ion &s;leep; and it is the point I want to clear and an&s;wer fully the objection of improbability. But, will they &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing the Magneti&s;ers to be endowed with the power of producing &s;leep, there is not the like rea&s;on to lead us to think that they can likewi&s;e produce Somnambuli&s;m?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer is plain and obvious.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="20">
<P>Somnambuli&s;m it&s;elf is nothing el&s;e but a mere modi|fication of &s;leep. There is no Somnambuli&s;m without &s;leep.</P>
<P>We might even add that there is no &s;leep without Som|nambuli&s;m, and that every man is born a Somnambule.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition, which is apparently a paradox, is no le&s;s inconte&s;table, provided too much extent is not allowed to the meaning of the word Somnambule. Perfect &s;leep is a time of re&s;t, during which, &s;en&s;ations are reduced to a &s;tate of concentration, which di&s;covers &s;eemingly no other &s;ign of life but re&s;piration and the motion of the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Imperfect &s;leep is that in which &s;uch a concentration is not complete, &s;o that it &s;till leaves &s;ome acce&s;s for the interior di&s;play of organs. We &s;eldom enjoy the former kind of &s;leep.</P>
<P>In a &s;ound and natural &s;leep, the per&s;on who&s;e mental powers were ab&s;olutely in &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, pre&s;erves &s;till a more or le&s;s active portion of watching, by the means of which divers motions are performed: Who does not know that during our very &s;leep, the body is agitated and combines it&s;elf, in order to chu&s;e an advantageous po&s;ition; the hand is continually a&s;&s;i&s;ting the incommoded parts, property adju&s;ts the bed clothes, de&s;troys in&s;ects, &amp;c. All the&s;e things doubtle&s;s belong to the watch, and of cour&s;e con&s;ti|tute a kind of Somnambuli&s;m. For we mu&s;t comprehend, under that denomation, the exerci&s;e of every motion what|ever occa&s;ioned during &s;leep.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men carry &s;till farther the effects of Somnambuli&s;m, &s;ince there are many people who &s;peak during their &s;leep, make different ge&s;tures, hold di&s;cour&s;es of a con&s;iderable length, addre&s;s tho&s;e whom they think them&s;elves in com|pany with, get out of their beds and in again, &amp;c.</P>
<P>So common are &s;uch practices, that they are to be met with almo&s;t in every hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whenever Somnambuli&s;m acquires a more extended pene|tration, it produces wonderful things.</P>
<P>Then the &s;leeper is &s;een writing, working, opening the doors, lighting the fire, a&s;cending the tops of hou&s;es, &s;wim|ming over rivers, currying hor&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t ob&s;erve that Somnambuli&s;m in this la&s;t de|gree is no new &s;tate, nor contrary to the nature of &s;leep; it is &s;ingly a reinforced modification of a &s;tate natural to man and inherent to &s;leep; which naturally leads us back to the
<PB N="21" REF="21">following propo&s;ition, "That every &s;leeper is in the com|mencement of Somnambuli&s;m;" that whoever gives him|&s;elf up to &s;leep is in a near &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, which is to di&s;play it&s;elf in a more or le&s;s &s;triking manner, ac|cording to the phy&s;ical con&s;titution of the &s;leeper, the na|ture of his di&s;temper, and e&s;pecially according to the diffe|rent cau&s;es which have produced, preceded, or accompa|nied his &s;leep.</P>
<P>From thence it is ea&s;ily conceived that a &s;ick per&s;on already inclined, either by his con&s;titution, or the nature of his di&s;ea&s;e, to a Somnambuli&s;m in its juvenile &s;tate, is liable to receive with Magnetical &s;leep a greater determina|tion towards Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>Is &s;uch a &s;tate u&s;eful in curing the di&s;ea&s;e? Such a que&s;|tion is not now to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Whether Somnambuli&s;m be &s;alutary or not, it is however certain, that it is a depen|dent on &s;leep, introduces it&s;elf with it, and ought con&s;e|quently to predominate more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>There are people who&s;e Magnetical drow&s;ine&s;s is attend|ed by no very &s;triking &s;igns of Somnambuli&s;m, who are only drow&s;y, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a continual &s;omnolency not in&s;en|&s;ible to any thing that may be tran&s;acted round them.</P>
<P>Others are only drow&s;y for a &s;hort time, then awake, and fall again into a &s;tate of drow&s;ine&s;s. The nuances are infinitely multiplied from the very &s;leepers, who di&s;play nothing but what u&s;ually appears in a common &s;leep to tho&s;e who perform the wonderful things &s;o much &s;poken of in all the world.</P>
<P>It is tho&s;e very marvels that remain to be explained: for having fully proved that Magnetical proceedings, or a con|tact graduate and combined according to principles, can pro|duce &s;leep and then Somnambuli&s;m; I &s;hall be obliged to reduce Magneti&s;m to that rule which is already known. But the Animal Magneti&s;m's adver&s;aries will not fail to ob|ject that Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m extends &s;till further, by offering the &s;pectacle of a Somnambuli&s;m of which we can have no idea, is attended with phoenomena never be|fore ob&s;erved in natural Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>Such is the la&s;t allegation, which &s;erves as a refuge to the incredulity of tho&s;e who never &s;aw any Somnambule, and the di&s;belief of them who had it in their power to &s;ee and be convinced. But it will, in a moment, be deemed &s;ur|pri&s;ing, to ob&s;erve that Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m has no|thing
<PB N="22" REF="22">&s;uperior to the effects of natural Somnambuli&s;m; that, on the contrary, it exactly agrees with the phoeno|mena of the latter &s;tate, which is nothing more than a more di&s;covery; and &s;uch a con&s;ideration might be, by many people, looked on as a victorious argument in favour of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m.</P>

<P>According to the virulent declamations thrown out again&s;t Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m, repre&s;enting it as a ba&s;e and deceitful trick, unworthy the lea&s;t credit, it would be natural to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch Phoenomena are without pre|cedents, and only concentered in Magnetical Somnambu|li&s;m.</P>
<P>Such is the prevalent opinion with the public, even among the &s;en&s;ible part, compo&s;ed of people no le&s;s re|markable for their virtues than their learning; but who, not being familiar with phy&s;iological phoenomena, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have adopted that way of thinking.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e very per&s;ons might, perhaps, have had a different opinion on that matter, if it had been in their power to know that there exi&s;ts in nature a &s;tate ab&s;olutely the &s;ame as that given out merely as a feigned one; and, that, the &s;ame phoenomena, which are, in the one, pronounced to be chimerical, impo&s;&s;ible and inadmi&s;&s;ible, are, in the other looked upon as inconte&s;table, and certainly beyond any manner of doubt.</P>
<P>Such a circum&s;tance makes a material difference; for they only refu&s;e to give credit to the phoenomena of Mag|netical Somnambuli&s;m, becau&s;e rea&s;on will hardly admit of facts by which it is hurt, and which are grounded on no precedents.</P>
<P>But if credit ought to be given to natural Somnambu|li&s;m, the &s;ame mu&s;t be granted to Magnetical Somnambu|li&s;m; for, it being proved that tho&s;e phoenomena really exi&s;t with regard to one of the&s;e two &s;pecies of Somnam|buli&s;m, it would be to contend for contradiction's &s;ake only, to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of their exi&s;tence in the other.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t then nece&s;&s;arily know that there exi&s;ts a &s;tate of natural Somnambuli&s;m, acknowledged and awarded by the faculty, during which, &s;leepers execute things impo&s;|&s;ible for any man awake to perform.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="23">
<P>Without entering into a detail of the &s;ingularities alrea|dy ob&s;erved on that account, I &s;hall only mention the phoenomena perfectly analogous to tho&s;e ob&s;erved among Magnetical Somnambules.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than to &s;ee Magnetical Som|nambules walk, go towards other people, &s;peak to them, come back to their places, take a book, paper, ink, in a word, perform a prodigious number of things which &s;up|ports the idea of perfect rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus is the public ju&s;tly incen&s;ed when any one pre|&s;umes to in&s;inuate, that &s;uch per&s;ons are not in a &s;tate of &s;leep, and that they neither &s;ee nor hear through their u&s;ual organs.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e Somnambules having their eyes open, the &s;pectators naturally thought they mu&s;t make u&s;e of them, and the faculty them&s;elves have ridiculed this pre|ten&s;ion, <Q>"That people could &s;ee without the u&s;e of their eyes, and having their eyes open, could not make u&s;e of them."</Q></P>
<P>But, unhappily for them, &s;uch a pu&s;illanimous ob&s;erva|tion lo&s;es much of its &s;trength, when we con&s;ider that even our learned have con&s;ecrated that very truth in one of their books, calculated to teach po&s;terity the actual &s;tate of our knowledge. Open the Encyclopedia, and at the word Somnambule, you may read literally thus:</P>
<P><Q>"People &s;truck with Somnambuli&s;m, given up to a &s;ound &s;leep, walk, talk, write and perform many other actions as if they were awake; nay, even &s;ometimes with more di&s;cernment and exactitude;"</Q> and afterwards,</P>
<P><Q>"Some Somnambules have their eyes open, but do not &s;eem to make u&s;e of them."</Q></P>
<P>The learned con&s;equently (for Encyclopedia is their work) are convinced plainly to believe, with Magneti&s;ers, that it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee without the eyes a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that though the Somnambule has his eyes open <HI>he does not make u&s;e of them.</HI></P>
<P>Magneti&s;ers have often ob&s;erved, that Magnetical Som|nambuli&s;m di&s;played in many patients a wonderful &s;ubtlety of &s;ight, &s;o far that they di&s;cern very delicate objects through a bandage, or any other intermediate body.</P>
<P>That propo&s;ition, has not been more &s;avourably re|ceived.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
<P>They have laughed at the &s;tory of a Magnetical Somnam|bule, who had written when his eyes were covered with a head-band, and corrected words, era&s;ed letters to &s;ub&s;titute others, upon or near them.</P>
<P>They &s;aid &s;uch a thing &s;hould be &s;een before it was be|lieved; and even after having really &s;een it, they &s;u&s;pected the good faith of the Somnambule, &s;o extraordinary the event appeared.</P>
<P>But how could they forget that our learned had before|hand prepared us to believe tho&s;e phoenomena, by pre|&s;enting them to us, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from Som|nambuli&s;m? <Q>"If you follow a Somnambule,"</Q> &s;ays the al|ready quoted article, <Q>"it is ca&s;y to perceive, that his &s;leep, &s;o much alike when he is awake, offers a prodi|gious number of wonderful things. Truth it&s;elf becomes incredible."</Q></P>
<P>The author de&s;pi&s;ing the exaggerations often attending on &s;uch &s;tories, has only referred <Q>"to notorious &s;acts, of which the truth cannot even be &s;u&s;pected."</Q></P>
<P>It is after &s;uch a preamble, that he relates the &s;tory of a young Somnambule, a clergyman and fellow-&s;tudent of the Archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux. That Prelate u&s;ed to go every night in that Somnambule's room, as &s;oon as he thought him a&s;leep. He remarked in particular, that the per&s;on got up, took paper, compo&s;ed and wrote &s;ermons. When he had fini&s;hed a page, he read it over, and repeated it very loud; if, adds the author, that action was done with|out the eyes a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can it be called reading?</P>
<P>The &s;ame clergyman with his eyes &s;hut compo&s;ed mu|&s;ic; a cane &s;erved him as a compa&s;s; with it he traced, at an equal di&s;tance, the five nece&s;&s;ary lines, put in their &s;tead the <HI>Key, Flat, Sharp,</HI> then marked the notes which he had fir&s;t done all white; and when he had fini&s;hed, in taking up again every one of them, he made them <HI>black,</HI> &s;uch as &s;hould have been &s;o, and wrote the words under.</P>
<P>It once happened that he wrote them with too <HI>large characters,</HI> &s;o that they were not placed directly under their corre&s;ponding notes; he &s;oon perceived his mi&s;take (with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his eyes) and in order to mend it, he era&s;ed what he had ju&s;t done, by pa&s;&s;ing his hand over, and made again lower that mu&s;ical line with all po&s;&s;ible preci&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="25">
<P>The Prelate to whom we are indebted for the&s;e particu|lars, having placed him&s;elf before the Somnambule to be enabled to follow him with more application, ob&s;erved a very wonderful circum&s;tance: The young clergyman hav|ing put in &s;ome place of his &s;ermon the words, <HI>this divine infant,</HI> perceived in reading it over again, that the&s;e two words made a di&s;agreeable di&s;&s;onance, and &s;ub&s;tituted the epithet <HI>adorable</HI> in&s;tead of the word <HI>divine;</HI> but that altera|tion left an imperfection in the phra&s;e, becau&s;e there was <HI>ce adorable enfant;</HI> the Somnambule perceiving the error, very dexterou&s;ly added a <HI>t</HI> after <HI>ce,</HI> &s;o that it was written <HI>cet adorable enfant.</HI></P>
<P>Whenever the Somnambule read or corrected what he had written, he took care to put his fingers on the charac|ters that were not yet dry; he made a digre&s;&s;ion to avoid rubbing them: a caution he never took when the letters were not wet.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that the Prelate, in order po&s;itively to know whether he made <HI>any u&s;e of his eyes,</HI> had imagined to put a <HI>pa&s;te-board under his no&s;e;</HI> and it was in that po&s;iti|on he continued the operations above-mentioned.</P>
<P>There are facts certified in the Encyclopedia it&s;elf, equally notorious, and above all contradiction; which is no doubt &s;ufficient evidently to prove one of the&s;e two points, viz. That the Somnambule can &s;ee without the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his eyes,</HI> or that his &s;ight, exalted to an incon|ceivable degree, pierces through his eyelids and the opa|cous bodies.</P>
<P>The memorials of the Academy of Sciences, and the phy&s;icians works, contain a prodigious number of ob&s;erva|tions which plainly con&s;irm the facts hinted, and others of the &s;ame nature. When an explanation of &s;uch a &s;ingulari|ty is demanded, they all unite to acknowledge the weakne&s;s of our comprehen&s;ion, and exhort us to admire what we cannot under&s;tand. What Encyclopedia &s;ays on that ac|count well de&s;erves to be related.</P>
<P><Q>"How is it po&s;&s;ible,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>"that a man buried in a <HI>&s;ound</HI> &s;leep &s;hould hear, walk, write, or &s;ee; in a word, enjoy the exerci&s;e of all his &s;en&s;es, and perform divers motions with exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion?</Q></P>
<P><Q>We mu&s;t freely own there exi&s;t many things, the rea&s;on of which we are quite ignorant of, and
<PB N="26" REF="26">which we cannot penetrate into, nature has its my&s;te|ries."</Q></P>
<P>The author of the &s;ame article, after having mentioned many &s;urpri&s;ing facts, which he a&s;&s;erts as inconte&s;table, makes a judicious &s;arca&s;m again&s;t tho&s;e pretenders in point of learning, who believe nothing but what they can account for, and will not for a moment &s;uppo&s;e, that there are in nature my&s;teries impenetrable to their &s;agacity. Let us now ob&s;erve the dangerous effect of prejudice.</P>
<P>Whenever the &s;ame phoenomena are repeated by a Mag|netical Somnambule, it is in&s;inuated tho&s;e concerned in them u&s;e deceit and fraud, becau&s;e &s;uch phoenomena are contrary to all received notions, and have no in&s;tance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ature to authori&s;e a belief. But how is it po&s;&s;ible to re|concile &s;uch a reclamation with the various examples which have ju&s;t now been quoted?</P>
<P>One of the chief objections again&s;t Magnetical Somnam|buli&s;m is, becau&s;e it offers both <HI>contradictions and incon&s;e|quences</HI> with that pretended &s;ubtlety of both &s;en&s;e and feel|ing.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved that tho&s;e Somnambules, &s;o di&s;|cerning with regard to certain objects, were altogether in|&s;en&s;ible of others.</P>
<P>For example, &s;uch a man who dexterou&s;ly cro&s;&s;es a row of chairs without touching them, and writes or reads through a pa&s;te-board, &s;hall not &s;ee whether there are people round him; he will take one thing for another, and &s;hall not perceive the fraud impo&s;ed on him.</P>
<P>But natural Somnambuli&s;m's example fully an&s;wers that objection, and the &s;uppo&s;ed contradiction, far from being an argument again&s;t the reality of Magnetical Somnambu|li&s;m, better e&s;tabli&s;hes its veracity, &s;ince it pre&s;ents a de|gree of re&s;emblance more con&s;i&s;tent with natural Somnam|buli&s;m.</P>
<P>The natural Somnambule of Encyclopedia well &s;aw his paper and letter through a pa&s;te-board, and yet could not &s;ee the very per&s;on who was placed before him, bu&s;ily employed in examining his motions.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Somnambule imagining he was walking on the border of a river, thought he &s;aw a child falling into the water; immediately he precipitates him&s;elf on his bed,
<PB N="27" REF="27">making the &s;ame ge&s;tures as a man &s;wimming, and after having much moved and fatigued him&s;elf, finding the bed clothes in a heap, he &s;uppo&s;es it the child, takes it up with one hand and employs the other to return, by &s;wimming on &s;hore; when he thinks him&s;elf there, he lays him&s;elf on the bed, and rattles his teeth, conveying the appearance of a man quite wet and cold; he then a&s;ks the by&s;tanders for a gla&s;s of brandy to warm him, and as they were giv|ing him a gla&s;s of water he perceived the trick, and in&s;i&s;t|ed on having brandy, which, as &s;oon as he has got, he ea|gerly drinks it, declaring, at the &s;ame time that it does him good.</P>
<P>By that example it is evident that the Somnambule, though deceived by the &s;ight and feeling, had his ta&s;te &s;ound and perfect, &s;ince he well knew how to di&s;cern brandy from water.</P>
<P>Such contradictions being hereditary to natural Somnam|bules, they &s;hould not be looked upon as extraordinary in Magnetical Somnambules, &s;ince both Somnambuli&s;ms are derived from a &s;ecret di&s;po&s;ition which, likely, are very near the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I had many times an opportunity of &s;eeing my&s;elf &s;uch contradictions, which at fir&s;t produced in me a great diffidence, becau&s;e I was not then well acquainted with the &s;ingularities inherent to Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>Two years ago being at the Marquis of <HI>Puy&s;egur</HI>'s I or|dered a Magnetical Somnambule, whom he &s;hewed me, to take a hat which was lying on a table in the clo&s;et, and to go and put it on the head of &s;ome of the company.</P>
<P>I did not expre&s;s my command in &s;peaking, but only by &s;ign in tracing the line which I gave him to run over, and at the end of which was the hat. The Somnambule, (who&s;e eyes were covered with a pa&s;te-board) got up from his chair, follows the direction &s;hewn with my finger, ad|vances towards the table, and takes the hat amid&s;t many other objects that were on the &s;ame table; but before he pre&s;ented it to the per&s;on, thinks it civil to bru&s;h it; and though there was no bru&s;h on the table, he makes the ge&s;|ture of a man who took one; and holding the hat with his left hand, he bru&s;hes it on the three &s;ides with his right hand, puts the imaginary bru&s;h on the table, and carries
<PB N="28" REF="28">the hat, placing it on the head of the indicated per&s;on. Though that Somnambule had perfectly fulfilled my inten|tion, I conceived &s;ome diffidence on account of the circum|&s;tance of the bru&s;h.</P>
<P>How could that man who&s;e &s;ight and feeling were &s;eem|ing perfectly &s;ound, not perceive there was no bru&s;h on the table! How could he mi&s;take him&s;elf &s;o far as to think he had one in his hand?</P>
<P>From thence I inferred, that having committed &s;o gro&s;s and palpable a mi&s;take, he was far from having the feeling and &s;ight as &s;ubtile as they would give to under&s;tand, and that there was in the re&s;t of his operations more addre&s;s than fair practice.</P>
<P>The Magnetical Somnambules, whom I have &s;ince &s;een, have all given me rea&s;on for the &s;ame di&s;&s;idence, by di&s;play|ing contradictions of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>But how great was my &s;urpri&s;e, when, after having con|&s;ulted the works, memorials, and relations made on Som|nambuli&s;m, I ob&s;erved the &s;ame contradictions in natural Somnambules, and that they were al&s;o an object of great a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;pectators; &s;o what at fir&s;t &s;eemed to me a motive of &s;u&s;picion, became at la&s;t a new rea&s;en to ground my per&s;ua&s;ion. <Q>"What is inconceivable,"</Q> &s;ays <HI>Pigatti,</HI> an Italian doctor, (&s;peaking of Somnambules) <Q>"is, that, on certain occa&s;ions their &s;en&s;ations are very &s;ubtile, whil&s;t, on others they are very impenetrable."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;aw in the &s;ame work an infinite number of other Som|nambules, which, after having at fir&s;t &s;hewn a wonderful &s;ubtlety of &s;en&s;ation, &s;eemed the next moment to be entirely deprived of them, by taking one thing for another, and confounding the objects which could claim no analogy to one another.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Somnambule that ever exi&s;ted, is, without a doubt, <HI>John Bapti&s;t Negretti,</HI> who was both fol|lowed and clo&s;ely examined during five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights, by a va&s;t number of people. Mr. Pigatti, who was pre&s;ent at tho&s;e experiments, has given an exact and preci&s;e account of them, which is found in the <HI>Journal Etranger,</HI> March 1756.</P>
<P>That Somnambule, having his eyes clo&s;ely &s;hut, took &s;nuff out of a box pre&s;ented to him, came down many large
<PB N="29" REF="29">&s;tairs without groping, he&s;itation, or even touching, turn|ing and &s;topping preci&s;ely where he &s;hould; placed bot|tles, and gla&s;&s;es on a &s;mall pillar which was in his way; went and came into the different apartments without run|ning again&s;t any thing; &s;topped at doors which were &s;hut, and opened them; went to draw water from the well, took out of the buffet napkins, towels, knives, and gene|rally all that was nece&s;&s;ary for a table; and performed ma|ny other things no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, too tedious to relate, but which all &s;uppo&s;e an exqui&s;ite &s;ubtlety in the &s;ight and feeling.</P>
<P>Next to this, are to be &s;een mi&s;takes, which quite con|tradict that perfection in the &s;en&s;es. After having looked for a light, the Somnambule imagines he has a candle in his hand; without perceiving his error, he thinks he holds a candle&s;tick whil&s;t it is only a bottle; he helps him&s;elf with that pretended light by carrying it along with him; he draws near the chimney to dry a wet towel, though there is no fire; he &s;alutes the ladies and gentlemen in who&s;e company he imagines him&s;elf, whil&s;t there is not any &s;uch per&s;on as he &s;uppo&s;es among tho&s;e that &s;urround him. He goes to the public-hou&s;e, thinking to be accompanied by a comrade, though there is not &s;uch a thing; he pours him &s;ome drink, addre&s;&s;es him, and drinks his health, with|out perceiving he is alone. When bu&s;y in eating a &s;allad, they take his plate away to &s;ub&s;titute a di&s;h of cabbages im|bibed with vinegar and cinnamon, unknown to him: they take the la&s;t di&s;h to &s;erve him with a plate of raw fritters, and he continues to eat; they give him water in&s;tead of wine; at la&s;t &s;omebody je&s;tingly rubbing his legs with a cane, he takes it for the beating of a dog which he &s;up|po&s;es near him; he falls in a pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the dog, looks for him, endeavours to beat him, goes and ferches a whip to cha&s;ti&s;e him: after having returned with the whip, &s;ome of the &s;pectators throw a muff at him; then imagining to lay hold of the dog, he beats him with violenc.</P>
<P>There are contradictions to explain that which &s;truck me &s;o forcibly in the Somnambule of the Marquis of <HI>Puy&s;egur,</HI> on account of the imaginary bru&s;h he thought he held.</P>
<P>There are an infinite number of other examples which might be quoted, and which all tend fully to manife&s;t that
<PB N="30" REF="30">inequality of &s;en&s;ations and &s;en&s;ibility ob&s;erved in the &s;eve|ral Somnambules.</P>
<P>The Library of Medicine, vol. x. p. 477. mentions a Somnambule, who getting out of his bed at mid-night, went to a neighbouring decayed hou&s;e, and of which but little remained, &s;aving the bare walls and &s;ome pieces of timber.</P>
<P>The Somnambule mounted to the very top of that hou&s;e, and jumped from one beam to another, though there was under a profound aby&s;s.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame work is related a &s;tory of another Somnam|bule, who, in the night time dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, put on his boots and &s;purs, and then leapt on the border of a window five &s;tories high, which he mi&s;took for his hor&s;e, and in that po&s;ture agitated him&s;elf with all the ge&s;tures of a cava|lier who rides po&s;t.</P>
<P>In the two la&s;t in&s;tances, there is an inexplicable a&s;&s;oci|ation of the mo&s;t perfect penetration, with the greate&s;t &s;tupidity. How a man, who had addre&s;s enough to climb up the top of a decayed hou&s;e, and run on a few weak beams, could not perceive the profound aby&s;s which lay under? and how he, who dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as a cavalier, put on his boots and &s;purs, could take the border of a window for a hor&s;e? To explain tho&s;e &s;ingularities, the principle of Somnambuli&s;m, and that want of organization which at that moment took place in the individual, &s;hould be better known.</P>
<P>That induces Mr. <HI>Rehelini,</HI> a colebrated Italian doctor, author of many ob&s;ervations on Somnambuli&s;m, to &s;ay, that we ought to content our&s;elves with admiring the wonderful effects of that condition which Providence &s;eems to pre&s;ent to the learned, in order to confound them, and &s;hew the narrow compa&s;s of human under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The apparent immobility and in&s;en&s;ibility of Magnetical Somnambules, for whatever is &s;aid or tran&s;acted round them, is al&s;o experienced in natural Somnambules. He whom I ju&s;t now &s;poken of, was quite in&s;en&s;ible to the approach of a candle, which almo&s;t burnt his eyebrows.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e in the memorials of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1742, p. 409, a di&s;&s;ertation of Mr. <HI>de Savage de in Croix</HI> on the Somnambuli&s;m of a girl from
<PB N="31" REF="31">Montpellier, exhibiting a &s;triking in&s;tance of the like in|&s;en&s;ibility:</P>
<P><Q>"On the 5th of April, 1757,"</Q> &s;ays the author, <Q>"when I vi&s;ited the ho&s;pital at ten o'clock in the morning I found the patient in bed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She began to &s;peak with a degree of vivacity and wit, which &s;he never &s;hewed when out of that &s;ituation; &s;he changed now and then her di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;eemed to ad|dre&s;s many of her friends who were a&s;&s;embling round her bed; what &s;he uttered &s;eemed to bear &s;ome analogy with what &s;he &s;aid in her attack of the preceding day, wherein having verbatim related an in&s;truction, in the way of a catechi&s;m, which &s;he heard the day before, &s;he made &s;ome moral and malicious applications to the peo|ple of the hou&s;e, whom &s;he took care to mention under fictitious names, accompanying the whole with ge&s;tures and motions of her eyes, which &s;he had opened: in a word, with all the circum&s;tances attending on the ac|tion done the day before; and yet &s;he was in a &s;ound &s;leep. It was a very awarded circum&s;tance which no one doubted; but fore&s;eeing I could never pre&s;ume to a&s;cer|tain it, unle&s;s I had previou&s;ly rendered &s;ome formal ex|periments, I made them on her &s;en&s;es and organs whil&s;t &s;he was in the act of &s;peaking.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At fir&s;t, as the girl had her eyes open, I thought that di&s;&s;imulation, if there was any in the ca&s;e, could not with&s;tand a &s;lap on the hand, or one given &s;uddenly on the face; but this repeated experiment did not either occa&s;ion the lea&s;t grimace or interrupt her di&s;cour&s;e: I had recour&s;e to another experiment, which was to put bri&s;kly my &s;inger to her eye, and to approach a lighted wax candle near enough to burn her eye-brows; but &s;he did not even twinkle on the occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Secondly, a hidden per&s;on made &s;uddenly a great noi&s;e in the girl's ear, and repeated it with a &s;tone again&s;t the bol&s;ter of her bed: at any other time &s;he would have been trembling with fear, but then &s;he appeared perfect|ly indifferent and in&s;en&s;ible to what pa&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thirdly, I poured in her eyes and mouth &s;ome bran|dy, and &s;pirit of ammoniac &s;alt; I even applied on the horny tuniele of the eye, a &s;eather's beard, then the end
<PB N="32" REF="32">of my finger, but in vain: Snuff blown up her no&s;e, pricking with pins, and fingers extorted, had on her the &s;ame effect as on a mere machine; &s;he never gave the lea&s;t &s;ign of &s;entiment."</Q></P>
<P>The 10th vol. of the Medicine's library contains a me|morial on a female Somnambule, who was in&s;en&s;ible to the blows &s;he received with a whip on her naked &s;houlders; one day they rubbed her back with honey, and in that con|dition expo&s;ed her in the &s;un's meridian to the &s;tinging of bees, which occa&s;ioned a great number of bli&s;ters on her body, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t motion in the world: but when &s;he awoke, &s;he &s;eemed to &s;uffer acute pain in the af|fected places, and bitterly complained of the hard u&s;age and treament &s;he had met with.</P>
<P>Concerning that woman, I ob&s;erved an intere&s;ting cir|cum&s;tance, which is perfectly conformable to what is now pa&s;t; it is becau&s;e the learned and other profe&s;&s;ors of me|dicine declined to go and verify the ca&s;e of that &s;leeper, under the pretence that &s;uch a &s;tate contradicted the noti|ons already received in phy&s;iology.</P>
<P>The author of the relation thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</P>
<P><Q>"The long &s;tay that woman made at Louvain, gave every body an opportunity of &s;eeing her, and &s;crupul|ou&s;ly examining &s;o extraordinary a phoenomenon. The ancient profe&s;&s;ors in that town looking on the event as a fable and mere chimera, could not take on them&s;elves to increa&s;e the number of &s;pectators. It is thus,"</Q> continues the author, <Q>"that prejudice &s;huts the eyes of men of the fir&s;t merit, and hinders them from &s;tudying and applying them&s;elves to the di&s;covery of &s;everal things which might prove very beneficial to monkind&mdash;La&s;tly,"</Q> &s;ays the &s;ame author, <Q>t"he young profe&s;&s;ors and other phy&s;icians in the town, looking on this phoenomenon with an indifferent eye, &s;eriou&s;ly enquired into the ca&s;e of that &s;leeper, and after a thorough inve&s;tigation, had every rea&s;on to be fully &s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P>It will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the author of this page is <Q>"a phy&s;ician of the faculty at Paris."</Q></P>
<P>Such an in&s;en&s;ibility is true, for the noi&s;e which &s;ur|rounds Magnetical Somnambules does not extend to eve|ry kind of noi&s;e, &s;ince the Somnambule pre&s;erves the facul|ty
<PB N="33" REF="33">of hearing tho&s;e per&s;ons with whom he is in analogy and harmony.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction has been deemed, by many, a mere ex|travagance, as it is not conceivable how, in the &s;ame in|dividual, a faculty could exi&s;t which lies open only to &s;uch a per&s;on, and open for all others.</P>
<P>But that wonder, repugnant to rea&s;on, finds its analogy in natural Somnambuli&s;m, wherein Somnambules are &s;een, who, though deaf to thundering noi&s;es and the voice of &s;e|veral people, yet hear very well, and without the lea&s;t di&s;|&s;iculty, another per&s;on with whom they keep an exclu&s;ive relation, &s;uch as <HI>patients, nur&s;es,</HI> or others they have more &s;pecially approached, as a <HI>hu&s;band, wife,</HI> or <HI>children.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t have not only the faculty of making them&s;elves heard to a natural Somnambule, but even that of making him <HI>&s;peak.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ingularity is &s;o very remarkable, that many authors complain that certain per&s;ons avail them&s;elves of &s;uch a circum&s;tance to catch the &s;ecret of the Somnambule. It is thus that begins the article Somnambule in Encyclopedia:</P>
<P><Q>"Somnambules are frequently &s;een,"</Q> &s;ays that article, <Q>"who, in their &s;leep relate whatever happened to them in the cour&s;e of the day; &s;ome an&s;wer the que&s;tions made them, and hold very con&s;i&s;tent di&s;cour&s;es. There are per&s;ons &s;o uncandid as to avail them&s;elves of the condi|tion they are in, "to catch in &s;pite of them," certain &s;ecrets which it is much their intere&s;t to conceal."</Q></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve well the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions <Q>"to catch in &s;pite of them."</Q> This plainly &s;hews the acknowledgment of the formal influence which certain per&s;ons awake can exerci&s;e over the Somnambule.</P>
<P>But by &s;imilar means and proceedings can &s;uch a relation take place betwixt the per&s;on awake and the Somnambule? Magneti&s;ers pretend, and in&s;inuate, that the relation is e&s;tabli&s;hed by mere contact, by touching the Somnambule in the extremities of his fingers or pul&s;e; or by touching, in a like manner, any body el&s;e in relation with him; which pre&s;ents a kind of re&s;emblance with the load&s;tone.</P>
<P>They have not failed in exclaiming again&s;t this affertion; and when experience has &s;eemingly convinced them of the truth, a deceit has been &s;u&s;pected on the part of the pre|tended Somnambule.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="34">
<P>But to what purpo&s;e then have they recour&s;e to that pre|tended reluctance, to admit of &s;o ancient an effect, and long &s;ince well known in the world? A proverbial expre&s;&s;ion traces us this opinion of old; for, it is well known that mo&s;t proverbs are but &s;cattered remains of forgotten truths.</P>
<P>But as many per&s;ons might refu&s;e &s;uch authority, we mu&s;t furni&s;h them with a te&s;timony given out by the learn|ed them&s;elves, and which fully evinces the efficacy of the proceeding taught Magneti&s;ers.</P>
<P><HI>Henry de Steers,</HI> a Flemi&s;h phy&s;ician, certifies, that he knew from his infancy a Somnambule, who, during his &s;leep, performed wonderful things; among others, he re|lates that in the middle of night, and during a mo&s;t pro|found &s;leep, he went and took his child out of the cradle where he lay, and then walked over all the hou&s;e, holding the infant in his arms: his wife, who had accidentally per|ceived this, afraid of the child, followed her hu&s;band &s;tep by &s;tep, with an intent of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them if occa&s;ion requir|ed: or, as &s;he had ob&s;erved that, in that &s;ituation her hu&s;|band an&s;wered all que&s;tions &s;he put to him, and took the freedom of interrogating him on the mo&s;t &s;ecret things &s;he wanted to know.</P>
<P>The author ob&s;erves that the hu&s;band was in day-time very circum&s;pect with his wife on his per&s;onal affairs, which he affected to conceal from her: but being interro|gated by his wife, when in a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m, and <Q>"holding his child in his arms,"</Q> then, &s;aid the author, he plainly an&s;wered all the que&s;tions put to him by his wife, who followed him, and <Q>"then had nothing concealed from her,"</Q> and was often &s;urpri&s;ed to hear her &s;peaking of things which he thought were only known to him&s;elf. Vide Library of Medicine, vol. x. p. 463.</P>
<P>The te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">timony of a re&s;pectable author &s;erves fir&s;t to con|firm that influence &s;poken of in the Encyclopedia, which lies in certain per&s;ons <Q>"to oblige the Somnambule to &s;peak and declare tho&s;e very thing which it was his inte|re&s;t to conceal."</Q> It al&s;o confirms the po&s;&s;ibility of finding out a means to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>relation</HI> between the per&s;on who is awake and the Somnambule.</P>
<P>The Somnambule we were &s;peaking of, was in no <HI>relation</HI> with his wife, from the moment he entered into the &s;tate of
<PB N="35" REF="35">Somnambuli&s;m; to e&s;tabli&s;h a communication, it was nece&s;|&s;ary he &s;hould have had <HI>his child in his arms.</HI> La&s;tly, ob|&s;erve, that the circum&s;tance of having his child in his arms, perfectly an&s;wers the proceedings pointed out by the Mag|neti&s;ers. The child, placed in his father's arms, and on the other hand &s;upported by the hands of a trembling mother, e&s;tabli&s;hed a relation between the hu&s;band and wife, through the communication and analogy he bore to each of them.</P>
<P>Thus, that a&s;toni&s;hing marvel, again&s;t which phy&s;icians have &s;o much inveighed as a mere chimera, a fable, a fraud, has, long ago, been atte&s;ted by one of their authors, who confirms in the mo&s;t preci&s;e manner what Magneti&s;ers had ad|vanced.&mdash;It is ea&s;y to perceive that Magneti&s;ers, by putting them&s;elves in harmony with Magnetical Somnambules, do nothing el&s;e but procure them&s;elves that intimate analogy, of which in&s;tances are to be found in natural Somnambu|li&s;m, and into the principle of which they have neglected to enquire.</P>
<P>As to the faculty the Magneti&s;ers pretend to be endowed with, to direct the Somnambule's motions, by making him go from the right to the left, forwards and backwards, in a direct and circulary line, after the manner of a load&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the Carupeas, that faculty is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of what has been &s;aid before; and after having admitted and acknowledged the power <Q>"of making a Som|nambule &s;peak again&s;t his will, and declare tho&s;e very things he has a material intere&s;t to conceal,"</Q> ought not have any great objection to admit the faculty of directing his motions.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance quoted by Kaau Boerhaave, will afford an idea of the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ubjection which a man is liable to with regard to another per&s;on with whom he is in affinity.</P>
<P>That author &s;peaks of a man who had the whim quickly to enter in affinity with all tho&s;e whom he approached.</P>
<P>After a few moments, his body acquired a &s;ympathetical flexibility which forced him to imitate, with preci&s;ion and rapidity, all the motions he perceived in the per&s;on he had fixed upon, as, <Q>"to move his eyes, lips, hands, arms, feet, to cover or uncover his head, walk, &amp;c."</Q> and all this in &s;pite of him&s;elf, and through the influence of a &s;u|perior force, which prompted his &s;ympathetical organs to act with tho&s;e of others.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
<P>It was an amu&s;ement to hold his hands in the pre&s;ence of any one who happened to make ge&s;tures, and then he was extremely agitated, continually &s;truggling and endea|vouring to &s;et him&s;elf at liberty.</P>
<P>If any kind of &s;en&s;ation was required of him, he was in tho&s;e moments con&s;trained, and an&s;wered he had the head or heart ach.</P>
<P>Boerhaave adds, that in con&s;equence of that odd kind of organization, he was obliged to go in the &s;treet with his eyes clo&s;ely &s;hut, and that he was a very trouble&s;ome mem|ber of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The example of &s;uch a &s;ympathetical &s;en&s;ibility may &s;erve to dimini&s;h the improbability, of the a&s;&s;inity and relation which Animal Magneti&s;m &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h between the patient and the Magneti&s;er; and it is on that account that Kaau Boerhaave certifies, that a man can, by the means of &s;uch an affinity well e&s;tabli&s;ned, become <Q>"a god for another man,"</Q> by making him &s;ub&s;ervient to his will and plea|&s;ure. <HI>Sic home homini Deus e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>We read in the work of the Marquis de Puy&s;egur, enti|tled, <Q>"Memorials to &s;erve for e&s;tabli&s;hing Animal Mag|neti&s;m,"</Q> many ob&s;ervations of that nature, concerning the patients he had put in a &s;tate of Somnambuli&s;m.</P>
<P>The very fir&s;t per&s;on, whom, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment he put in that &s;tate, was in &s;uch perfect affinity with him, that he exactly followed all his motions, and loudly repeat|ed every air which the Marquis internally &s;ang.</P>
<P>That &s;ingularity which at fir&s;t appeared incredible, ac|quires (notwith&s;tanding the high character of the author) a new degree of authority from the above related examples, and the te&s;timony of the authors, who have &s;poken of that kind of &s;ympathetical influence.</P>
<P>The proceedings made u&s;e of by Magneti&s;ers find likewi&s;e their analogy and authority in natural Somnambuli&s;m.</P>

I united tho&s;e thoughts in him, and by that means forced him to move him&s;elf in his chair, as in imitation of dancing, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e phoenomena have been &s;u&s;pected, though they are fully confirmed by the Encyclopedia in the article of Som|nambule.</P>
<P>The author of that article, relating a number of wonder|ful facts in the Somnambule mentioned, continues thus:</P>
<P><Q>"The &s;ame Somnambule has furni&s;hed us with a great number of extraordinary facts: but tho&s;e which I have related are &s;ufficient to my purpo&s;e. I &s;hall therefore only add, that whenever I had a mind to make him change his di&s;cour&s;e, leave off &s;ad and di&s;agreeable &s;ub|jects, it was &s;ufficient to pa&s;s a pen over his lip, and immediately he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed quite different que&s;tion."</Q></P>
<P>That conformity betwixt both recitals, &s;erves to confirm the one by the other; and if, after that double te&s;timony, any one is authorized to per&s;evere in his &s;urprize, he is &s;till more &s;o to per&s;evere in his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>To conclude, the la&s;t proof of re&s;emblance between the two kinds of Somnambules is, that of waking: they both entirely forget whatever they have either done or &s;aid dur|ing their &s;leep.</P>
<P>I could, by extending &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, account for the communication of thoughts, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of either voice or &s;igns, it being ea&s;y to &s;hew that this &s;ingularity is not more difficult to be under&s;tood than the other; that it has been &s;u&s;pected by ancient phy&s;iologi&s;ts; and even men|tioned in modern works of celebrated phy&s;icians; but I think it u&s;ele&s;s to expatiate any further on a phoenomenon with which the different minds are not as yet grown fami|liar enough.</P>
<P>My object is, by no means, to write a complete work wherein the &s;ubject of Magnetical Somnambuli&s;m &s;hould
<PB N="38" REF="38">be fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I only meant to elucidate &s;ome ideas, and to encourage judicious per&s;ons to inve&s;tigate the matter, excite their reflections, and provoke in them a philo&s;ophi|cal doubt, and la&s;tly, to encourage them to contribute, by inve&s;tigation and ob&s;ervations, to re&s;olve a problem no le&s;s intere&s;ting to mankind than conducive to the im|provement of Sciences.</P>
<P>In my next I &s;hall give an E&s;&s;ay on the Theory of Som|nambuli&s;m.</P>
