<P>IT is univer&s;ally agreed, that among the &s;everal other Branches of Learning, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Accompli&s;h|ment of tho&s;e, who are Candidates in the Art of Healing; <HI>the judicious In&s;tructions of an able, practical Phy&s;ician, is a Qualifica|tion of the fir&s;t Moment.</HI> The Rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent Conce&s;&s;ion is very evident: Be|cau&s;e
<PB N="ij" REF="3">the Pupil, as the Re&s;ult of &s;uch an <HI>happy In&s;titution,</HI> according to the <HI>Stand|ing</HI> of his Profe&s;&s;or, may, in <HI>a few Years,</HI> enter upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, with greater Advan|tage, than he could po&s;&s;ibly do, in <HI>many,</HI> without &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance. For my&s;elf, I own, I am too vain, not to account it a <HI>&s;ingular Felicity</HI> in my Life, that I have been ble&s;s'd with an Opportunity of at|tending Sir RICHARD MANNINGHAM'S Lectures in <HI>Midwifery</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ic.</HI></P>
<P>I PAY a greater Deference to that GEN|TLEMAN'S <HI>good Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h'd Mode&s;ty,</HI> than either to affront <HI>the one,</HI> or in&s;ult <HI>the other,</HI> by attempting any thing, that might carry the Appearance of an <HI>En|comium,</HI> tho' religiou&s;ly confined to <HI>his ju&s;t Prai&s;e:</HI> Neverthele&s;s, as every <HI>gene|rous</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Mind would be equally careful, neither to offend again&s;t the Laws of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to an ingenious Tutor, for the mo&s;t <HI>in&s;tructive Dictates;</HI> nor tho&s;e of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> due to the Public, for who&s;e Service, Gentlemen, you are pre|paring:
<PB N="iij" REF="4">I expect it be allowed me, on the <HI>pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion,</HI> as a nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tance of <HI>Duty</HI> to Both; that I am at Liberty to de|clare, I want no Veneration for Sir RI|CHARD'S <HI>Whole Cour&s;e.</HI>&mdash;It is compo&s;ed, indeed, of <HI>Two grand Branches,</HI> which are tho&s;e of <HI>Midwifery</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ic.</HI> The <HI>for|mer</HI> of the&s;e is by no means de&s;titute of its Beauties: Such as the <HI>Improvements</HI> in the <HI>Apparatus</HI> it&s;elf; the <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI> of the In&s;ti|tution; and the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> of all In&s;tru|ments.&mdash;For the fir&s;t: The <HI>greater Ma|chine</HI> is the <HI>mo&s;t fini&s;h'd,</HI> in its way, that has, as yet, ever appeared, for conduct|ing the <HI>different Kinds</HI> of <HI>Deliveries;</HI> while the <HI>Gla&s;s Machine</HI> gives ocular Proof of the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tne&s;s</HI> of the Rules to be ob&s;erved in <HI>Operations</HI> on the Other; and, con&s;equently, in <HI>Genuine Labours.</HI>&mdash;For the next: It is not po&s;&s;ible, by <HI>this Manner</HI> of In&s;truction, to give the lea&s;t Offence to the <HI>cha&s;te&s;t Mind,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>&s;crupulous Mode&s;ty.</HI> &mdash; And with re&s;pect to the Affair of <HI>In&s;truments:</HI> It is evident
<PB N="iv" REF="5">to a Demon&s;tration, from <HI>this Method</HI> of Practice, that there is &s;o little Occa&s;ion for the pre&s;ent <HI>frequent</HI> U&s;e of them, that excepting in a <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> or <HI>two,</HI> which but <HI>rarely</HI> happen; the <HI>judicious Management</HI> of the Hand, is all that is required in the Art of <HI>Midwifery.</HI></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, I abhor <HI>Flattery</HI> and <HI>O&s;tentation:</HI> And I cannot but per&s;uade my&s;elf, you will acquit me of <HI>Both,</HI> when I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould, at no rate, have taken upon me to have been either &s;o <HI>par|ticular,</HI> or <HI>po&s;itive</HI> in the Articles above, if I were not very well acquainted, with <HI>the utmo&s;t,</HI> that has been done <HI>Abroad</HI> on the Subject of <HI>Midwifery.</HI> I &s;tudied under Two Ma&s;ters, the late Me&s;&s;ieurs GRE|GOIRE and DUSS&Eacute;, at PARIS; and came from thence with no &s;mall Freight of <HI>Self-&s;ufficiency</HI> and <HI>Confidence:</HI> Nor is it <HI>proba|ble</HI> to me, I &s;hould ever have been di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of my <HI>per&s;onal Prejudices</HI> and <HI>dan|gerous Mi&s;takes</HI> (e&s;pecially in the U&s;e of <HI>In&s;truments</HI>) had I not fell under Sir RI|CHARD's
<PB N="v" REF="6">In&s;titution, and formed my&s;elf on <HI>His Practice.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things notwith&s;tanding: As I always thought the matter of <HI>Deliveries</HI> the lea&s;t Branch of the <HI>Man-Midwife's</HI> Character; and was a&s;&s;ured, that He would ever have mo&s;t Succe&s;s in <HI>Operations,</HI> who was be&s;t acquainted with the <HI>Structure</HI> of the <HI>Human Body:</HI> So I could not help be|ing e&s;pecially charmed with tho&s;e Lectures in Sir RICHARD's Cour&s;e, which proper|ly belong to the <HI>latter</HI> Branch, the Head of <HI>Phy&s;ic.</HI> The <HI>&s;uperior Utility</HI> of the Subject will excu&s;e my pa&s;&s;ionate Regard on this Part: Since it is plain, that the Science, which leads to a <HI>general View</HI> of the <HI>animal Machine,</HI> and to a <HI>perfect Know|ledge</HI> of all the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> to which the whole Nature, in common, is incident; mu&s;t be va&s;tly preferable to all that is <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>confined,</HI> however <HI>exalted</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> in it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHAT was la&s;t ob&s;erved, Gentlemen, you will plea&s;e to remember, is de&s;igned,
<PB N="vj" REF="7">not only to account for the <HI>extraordinary Pains</HI> I was at in &s;ecuring this Lecture; but is al&s;o offered as a Rea&s;on, why you are to believe it <HI>tolerably correct.</HI> For the <HI>latter</HI> indeed, you have this additional A&s;|&s;urance, that I had not only &s;everal Op|portunities of attending the Repetition of it; but was, moreover, allow'd the pecu|liar Indulgence of taking it in <HI>&s;hort-hand,</HI> as delivered.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, it would give me no &s;mall Pain, were I the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive, I was taking <HI>any Freedom,</HI> that might <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> ex|po&s;e me to the Re&s;entment of Sir RI|CHARD MANNINGHAM: But, I flatter my&s;elf with le&s;s Danger in this Point, &s;o far as concerns the <HI>pre&s;ent Publication,</HI> however; &s;ince, I am only indulging the <HI>Engli&s;h Reader</HI> with his excellent <HI>Method of Inve&s;tigating Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> in the manner he explain'd it to Us, in his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Evening's Lecture in <HI>Phy&s;ic;</HI> at the &s;ame time, that it is to be ob&s;erved, he has already com|municated <HI>the Method it&s;elf</HI> to the learned
<PB N="vij" REF="8">World in his <HI>Latin Compendium:</HI> Tho' &s;ome of <HI>the be&s;t Judges</HI> have acknowledg|ed it's Claim to an <HI>higher Title.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is one Circum&s;tance, Gentle|men, of great Importance in the pre&s;ent Lecture, I mean: That the whole Argu|ment is built on <HI>the mo&s;t venerable Anti|quity,</HI> and not on any <HI>precarious, modern Theories.</HI> I take the Liberty of in&s;erting this <HI>previous Hint;</HI> not but your own At|tention in Reading would have excu&s;ed me the Trouble; becau&s;e you will from hence immediately argue its <HI>intrin&s;ic Va|lue,</HI> and give more boldly into its <HI>U&s;e.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Hi&s;tories of Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> originally put together by the <HI>mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;ervations</HI> of HIPPOCRATES, and e&s;tabli&s;hed on <HI>the Authority</HI> of his Succe&s;&s;ors, <HI>the mo&s;t celebrated ancient Phy&s;icians,</HI> is here <HI>your Standard.</HI> Nature, &s;ince her various <HI>morbid Phaenomena</HI> were, in <HI>their</HI> manner, fir&s;t reduced to <HI>any regular Sy&s;tem,</HI> ap|pears to have &s;uffered <HI>no Deviation</HI> for &s;ome thou&s;and Years pa&s;t; nor can, in|deed,
<PB N="viij" REF="9">be capable of any, for the future, while <HI>the animal Oeconomy,</HI> and <HI>the Laws,</HI> under which the human Species continues to act, remain <HI>invariable.</HI></P>
<P>I WISH nothing more ardently, than that, as the Subject, on which the Lecture before you is rais'd, is of <HI>general U&s;e</HI> in it&s;elf; and it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, every Stu|dent's <HI>Situation</HI> &s;hould allow him an Op|portunity of attending on <HI>the Spot:</HI> Tho&s;e, into who&s;e Hands it may now fall, may find as much <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> in receiving it from the Pre&s;s, as the Pub|li&s;her has perpetually retained, &s;ince he fir&s;t took it from Sir RICHARD's own Mouth.

<HEAD>The CERTAIN METHOD to KNOW the DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the Cour&s;e of our LECTURES in <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> we propo&s;e, chiefly to confine our&s;elves to <HI>the Di&s;ea&s;es of Children,</HI> from <HI>Infancy</HI> up to <HI>ripe Age;</HI> and to the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> peculiar to <HI>the Female Sex;</HI> tho&s;e e&s;pecially, belonging to <HI>Pregnancy</HI> and <HI>Childbed:</HI> Neverthele&s;s, as Women are liable to all the Di|&s;tempers incident to Men, be&s;ides the many pecu|liar to their own Sex, as they are, by Nature, or|dained for the Pre&s;ervation of Mankind; it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in a great mea&s;ure, to treat of Di&s;|ea&s;es at large; and more particularly of <HI>Fevers,</HI> which, indeed, make up a very great Part of the Di&s;orders that afflict us, and do al&s;o a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves, with every other Di&s;ea&s;e: <HI>Febris, maxime communis Morbus, omnium aliorum Morborum, praecipue Inflammationis, comes e&s;t.</HI> HIPPOCRATES. The Truth of which we daily experience; and, moreover, often ob&s;erve that, a
<PB N="2" REF="11"><HI>Fever</HI> &s;hall even elude <HI>that Method</HI> of curing a Di&s;ea&s;e, which, without a Fever, has been gene|rally found &s;ucce&s;sful; an Ob&s;ervation well wor|thy our particular Notice.</P>
<P>WOMEN with Child, and in Childbed, are often afflicted with Di&s;tempers, no ways <HI>cognate</HI> to <HI>Pregnancy</HI> or Childbed; e&s;pecially <HI>Fevers</HI> of all Kinds, who&s;e E&s;&s;ence and Nature, indeed, differ nothing from other Fevers, and require a like Me|thod of Cure; yet, by rea&s;on of their happening at the Times above-mentioned, are attended with greater Difficulties in Curing, and demand our greate&s;t Caution and Prudence, in the Admini&s;tra|tion of the proper Remedies for the Fever; the Phy&s;ician at this time, not being at Liberty, &s;o freely to make u&s;e of Bleeding, Vomiting, Bli&s;tring, Sweating, Purging, and Method of Diet: And during Pregnancy, our chief View mu&s;t always be <HI>to prevent a Mi&s;carriage,</HI> or even <HI>the bringing on of Labour,</HI> whenever the Di&s;ea&s;e has no <HI>Affinity</HI> to Pregnancy. For tho' Di&s;ea&s;es, which are ow|ing to Pregnancy, either decrea&s;e, or go off upon Delivery; yet, tho&s;e which are no ways <HI>cognate,</HI> are for the mo&s;t part found to increa&s;e after the Delivery; and as HIPPOCRATES ob&s;erves: <HI>Si mulier, Utero ge&s;tans, morbum habuerit non cogna|tum, in Puerperii purgatione, perit.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE, as in all Di&s;ea&s;es not <HI>cognate</HI> to Pregnancy, our chief View, as I ob&s;erved above, mu&s;t be, to prevent <HI>Abortion</HI> and <HI>untimely La|bour;</HI> &s;o in all Di&s;ea&s;es happening in Childbed,
<PB N="3" REF="12">our principal Aim, mu&s;t <HI>then</HI> be directed, to the due Regulation of the <HI>Lochia.</HI> Many, and great Dif|ficulties &s;urround us, in this dangerous and com|plicated Situation, which exact our mo&s;t diligent Care and Attention: And, as it is <HI>oftentimes</HI> no ea&s;y Matter to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>cognate Di|&s;temper,</HI> and that which has <HI>no relation</HI> to Preg|nancy or Childbed; and at <HI>all times,</HI> very difficult rightly and &s;afely to conduct Affairs, in this nice and critical Situation; I &s;hall therefore, in my &s;ub&s;equent Lectures, endeavour, to the be&s;t of my Judgment and Knowledge, to inform and direct you in each Particular, from the repeated Ob&s;er|vations of the mo&s;t approved Authors in Phy&s;ic, both ancient and modern; and al&s;o from Experi|ences and Succe&s;&s;es, collected from my own <HI>Ad|ver&s;aria,</HI> confirming their Doctrine; be&s;ides which, I &s;hall illu&s;trate each Ca&s;e, by the particular Ap|plication of the Method of <HI>Inve&s;tigating</HI> the Na|ture of all Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim univer&s;ally received among Phy|&s;icians: <HI>That Medicine &s;hould begin, where Philo&s;o|phy ends.</HI> And as it is, undoubtedly, a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification in a Phy&s;ician to be knowing in <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophy;</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> is that Part of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which is more e&s;pecially conducive to the Knowledge of the Practice of Phy&s;ic: I make no doubt, but you, Gentlemen, who have in <HI>this City</HI> the be&s;t Opportunities of being in&s;tructed in this Branch of Science; e&s;pecially by that mo&s;t accurate, and excellent Anatomi&s;t and Phy&s;ician, Dr. NICHOLLS; who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is an Ornament
<PB N="4" REF="13">of our Profe&s;&s;ion, and worthy of &s;ingular Prai&s;e: I &s;ay, I make no doubt, but with &s;uch Advantages, you have already obtained a competent Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> and will, therefore, be enabled to make the be&s;t U&s;e of our Lectures, and Method of <HI>Inve&s;tigating</HI> the Nature of Di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>NOW, the human Body, we all know, may be properly con&s;idered, as <HI>a mo&s;t perfect Machine;</HI> who&s;e Parts are extremely well configurated and joined together; who&s;e Symmetry is mo&s;t beauti|ful; and who&s;e Actions, re&s;ulting from this admi|rable Compages, are reciprocally carried on by So|lids and Fluids, of which it is made up. And as many of its <HI>Actions</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> are ea&s;ily demon|&s;trated to be the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences</HI> of it's <HI>Stru|cture;</HI> &s;o its <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and all their <HI>Symptoms,</HI> are only the <HI>irregular Motions,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> of this very complicated Machine: Nor is the Ca&s;e the lea&s;t altered, that we have a <HI>Principle</HI> within us, not &s;ubject, in it&s;elf, to the Laws of Motion.</P>
<P>IT is, therefore, highly incumbent on every one, who would attain to the <HI>due Knowledge</HI> of the Art of Healing, that he make him&s;elf very well acquainted with this curious Machine: that know|ing well the <HI>Parts,</HI> and the <HI>natural Actions,</HI> and <HI>Secretions</HI> of the human Body; he may be enabled to judge, <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> the&s;e natural Actions are <HI>perverted:</HI> all the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es, being the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of the <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy.</HI> It's Actions therefore being per|formed
<PB N="5" REF="14">by <HI>Fluids</HI> &s;ecerned from the Blood; without the Knowledge of <HI>Secretions,</HI> we cannot under|&s;tand the <HI>Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es: Secretion</HI> being the <HI>Spring</HI> of all <HI>animal Functions.</HI> Wherefore, the greater our Knowledge is of the <HI>Animal Oecono|my,</HI> the more likely we &s;hall be, to di&s;cover the <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of its Di&s;ea&s;es; and of cour&s;e be better enabled to <HI>rectify</HI> all its Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE is, no doubt, of great and nece&s;&s;ary U&s;e, in promoting the Art of curing Di&s;ea&s;es, if directed by a Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI> fora&s;much as it is only by a ju&s;t rea&s;on|ing on our Experiences, that we can come at the Knowledge of any Phaenomenon of Nature. So that <HI>Experience,</HI> or the Knowledge of the <HI>Hi&s;tories of Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> added to that of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> is what can only make a Phy&s;ician; and, where|ever the <HI>Hi&s;tory of a Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> is exactly known, if the <HI>right Method</HI> of curing it <HI>cannot be deduced,</HI> it mu&s;t be, becau&s;e the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> is not <HI>&s;uffi|ciently under&s;tood:</HI> For our Skill in curing Di&s;ea&s;es, who&s;e <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> are exactly known, is, for the mo&s;t part, proportional to our Knowledge of the <HI>Ani|mal Oeconomy.</HI> For in order to find out the <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of a Di&s;temper, and from them to de|duce a <HI>right Method</HI> of Cure, it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to rea&s;on on <HI>tho&s;e Hi&s;tories;</HI> which we cannot do, as we ought, if we are ignorant of the <HI>Structure</HI> of the <HI>Machine,</HI> we are about to <HI>rectify.</HI></P>
<P>DESCRIPTIONS and <HI>Diagno&s;tic Signs</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es, are the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="15">and <HI>Experience;</HI> but, <HI>Indications</HI> of Cure ari&s;e from <HI>our rea&s;oning</HI> upon tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations. <HI>Di|agno&s;tics</HI> are properly a Collection of <HI>particular Symptoms</HI> only; but <HI>Indications</HI> are tho&s;e <HI>Conclu&s;i|ons,</HI> which our Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oecono|my</HI> enables us to make on the&s;e <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> and <HI>De&s;criptions:</HI> So that the <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Knowledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> mu&s;t al|ways go hand in hand, in order to the obtaining the <HI>due Knowledge</HI> of the Practice of Phy&s;ic. He therefore, who is &s;ufficiently knowing in <HI>Philo&s;o|phy</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and makes <HI>a proper U&s;e</HI> of this Knowledge, by <HI>rea&s;oning on real Facts,</HI> grounded on <HI>repeated Experience</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to u&s;e his <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> aright; and may then rea&s;onably hope for Succe&s;s, in finding out the <HI>genuine Indications</HI> of Cure, in which, the Practice of Phy&s;ic chiefly con&s;i&s;ts: And without this <HI>Caution</HI> our <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> will certainly be to ve|ry little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE great HIPPOCRATES has this A&s;&s;ertion: That <HI>Nature cures Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> The Truth of it we, of this Day, may experience, if we will carefully keep up to his <HI>excellent Directions,</HI> and <HI>Method:</HI> It being his only Aim to <HI>relieve Nature</HI> when op|pre&s;&s;ed, in the <HI>very Way,</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> he ob&s;erved <HI>her endeavouring to expel Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> And it was by <HI>a con&s;tant Diligence</HI> of this Kind, joined with his <HI>wonderful Sagacity,</HI> that he arrived to that great Degree of Perfection in the Knowledge of Phy&s;ic: Hence he perceived that, <HI>Nature her&s;elf judges Di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> and, indeed, does all, being <HI>properly a&s;|&s;i&s;ted;</HI>

<P>HIPPOCRATES al&s;o informs us, and our <HI>own Experience</HI> cannot but <HI>confirm</HI> it: That tho&s;e People who have <HI>Fevers,</HI> and are <HI>left to them&s;elves,</HI> and take <HI>no Medicines;</HI> if they do recover, get rid of their <HI>Fevers</HI> by <HI>Sweating, a Loo&s;ene&s;s, an Haemor|rhage, Diabetes,</HI> or the like: From whence HIP|POCRATES, and the ancient Practitioners in Phy|&s;ic, took their <HI>fir&s;t Intimation</HI> to provoke <HI>Sweat</HI> and the <HI>other Evacuations.</HI> And from their <HI>re|peated Ob&s;ervations</HI> and <HI>Succe&s;&s;es,</HI> they have form|ed for us, a mo&s;t <HI>rational Method</HI> of Cure.

<PB N="8" REF="17">is a Matter of no &s;mall Con&s;equence.

<P>IF an altogether <HI>new Di&s;temper</HI> &s;hould at any time ari&s;e among us, the only Way of getting into the Nature of &s;uch <HI>new Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> would be to copy HIPPOCRATES's Example; I mean, <HI>his Me|thod of ob&s;erving,</HI> joined to <HI>the Rule</HI> of finding out the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es: For we mu&s;t, fir&s;t, be led by <HI>Symptoms</HI> to find a Di&s;ea&s;e; after that it's <HI>Nature,</HI> and from <HI>thence</HI> the Method of Cure.

<PB N="9" REF="18">carefully examining their <HI>Symptoms,</HI> as directed by <HI>our Method</HI> of di&s;covering the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es; will be &s;ufficient to give us the <HI>Nature, Cau&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> of Cure, of the Di&s;ea&s;e of <HI>every Con&s;titu|tion</HI> whatever.

<P>THE many accurate and charming <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> of Di&s;tempers, delivered down to us by HIPPO|CRATES in his <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es; wherein the Phaenomena of <HI>each Di&s;temper,</HI> even in its minu|te&s;t Circum&s;tances, are ob&s;erved; pre&s;ent us with a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Delineation of Nature: and if duly attended, will always be found, of the great|e&s;t Service for advancing our Progre&s;s in the Art of Healing. Becau&s;e, from his <HI>Diagno&s;tics in particu|lar,</HI> and others of the <HI>Antients,</HI> and <HI>&s;uch</HI> among the <HI>Moderns,</HI> who have clo&s;ely copied after <HI>His manner;</HI> we readily di&s;cover the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e. And as, whenever we arrive at the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>exact Hi&s;tory</HI> of any Di&s;temper, whether from Books, or our own careful Ob&s;ervations; we may, at all times, by the right and diligent Application of the <HI>Method of Inve&s;tigation,</HI> mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly di&s;|cover the <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>conjunct</HI> Cau&s;e; &s;o may we likewi&s;e, on tho&s;e Principles, ea&s;ily come at the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e; when, having that
<PB N="10" REF="19">given, it will be no difficult matter to find out <HI>Re|medies</HI> to Cure, in all <HI>curable</HI> Ca&s;es; and to admi|ni&s;ter <HI>Relief,</HI> even in tho&s;e, which are <HI>incurable.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>unwearied Diligence</HI> in Ob&s;ervation, and <HI>clo&s;e Attendance</HI> on Nature in that <HI>&s;agacious,</HI> great Man HIPPOCARTES, and others of the <HI>Antients;</HI> might probably be heightened in them, from the <HI>Scantine&s;s</HI> of their <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and the ex|ceeding <HI>Har&s;hne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>then known Remedies;</HI> however, much to our Benefit: &s;ince the excellent <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es they have given us, can not only <HI>never be exceeded,</HI> but will <HI>always remain invariably true,</HI> while Human Nature continues the &s;ame. And had tho&s;e of later Ages, who have been &s;o happily provided with a more copious and &s;alutary <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> and who, it mu&s;t be allowed, have been greatly improved in the Know|ledge of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> had the&s;e, I &s;ay, con&s;tantly per&s;evered in the U&s;e of HIPPOCRA|TES'S <HI>great Diligence</HI> and <HI>Manner of ob&s;erving;</HI> they might, doubtle&s;s, long ago, have brought the Practice of Phy&s;ic to a con&s;iderable Degree of Per|fection; tho' they had not been ble&s;s'd with his <HI>extraordinary Sagacity:</HI> For that, indeed, is a pe|culiar Happine&s;s, and the Lot of a very few; in which Particular, I believe, we may &s;ay of the Phy&s;ician, as is commonly done of the Poet: <HI>Na|&s;citur, non fit.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;hould we of this Age, flu&s;hed with our &s;uperior Knowledge in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> and the Variety of our <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> neglect to
<PB N="11" REF="20">make u&s;e of that <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Diligence,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary in attending the <HI>Motions</HI> and <HI>Intentions</HI> of Nature; and, in&s;tead of endeavouring to <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t her</HI> on the&s;e Principles, when oppre&s;s'd, become too <HI>precipitate</HI> and <HI>officious,</HI> in the Admini&s;tration of our Medicines; the Con&s;equence will inevitably be, that we &s;hall only <HI>ob&s;cure the Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> by <HI>mul|tiplying,</HI> rather than <HI>taking off the Symptoms;</HI> and this to our own per&s;onal Confu&s;ion, the manife&s;t Injury of our Patients, and the great Di&s;repute of our Profe&s;&s;ion. Whereas, would we con&s;ult <HI>the true</HI> and <HI>proper U&s;e</HI> of the many happy <HI>Improve|ments</HI> of our own Age, I think, it cannot be done more effectually, than by keeping clo&s;e to our mo&s;t &s;kilful Leader, HIPPOCRATES; together with the ancient Practitioners in Phy&s;ick, in <HI>their Manner</HI> of ob&s;erving, and in <HI>their Method</HI> of heal|ing; founded upon the Knowledge of the <HI>conjunct Cau&s;es</HI> of <HI>Di&s;tempers,</HI> from whence alone, the <HI>cu|rative Indications</HI> are to be taken: agreeable to the Method <HI>here</HI> mentioned, and HIPPOCRATES'S Manner of ob&s;erving. And by a careful <HI>Per&s;eve|rance</HI> in the&s;e Methods, I imagine, we may rea|&s;onably hope for the greate&s;t Succe&s;s; and may, perhaps, in a few Ages, arrive at the highe&s;t Per|fection in the Practice of Phy&s;ic, that human Na|ture is capable of attaining.</P>
<P>FROM what I have already advanced, you will naturally conclude, that it is <HI>no ea&s;y Matter</HI> to be|come <HI>a prudent</HI> and <HI>&s;kilful Phy&s;ician:</HI> Much Read|ing, much Thought and Pains will really be re|quired; many Things are nece&s;&s;ary to be learnt&punc;
<PB N="12" REF="21">much <HI>Diligence</HI> in Inquiry, much <HI>A&s;&s;iduity</HI> in Ob&s;ervation is to be u&s;ed, before we can be <HI>duly</HI> qualified, either with Peace of Mind to our&s;elves, or Relief to our Patients, to undertake a Tru&s;t, in which the Lives of our Fellow-creatures are &s;o nearly concerned.</P>
<P>IF this be a ju&s;t State of the Ca&s;e, what &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who boldly take upon them the Practice of Phy&s;ic, without <HI>the lea&s;t pre|vious Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Requi&s;ites</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for <HI>the regular Di&s;charge</HI> of this important Office? Certainly it can be no other than the <HI>great|e&s;t Folly,</HI> and the <HI>highe&s;t Pre&s;umption,</HI> for Tho&s;e to expect <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> or hope for <HI>a Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on their En|deavours; who are <HI>altogether ignorant</HI> of the Pro|vince in which they engage: And would &s;uch Per&s;ons but give them&s;elves Time to reflect, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, the <HI>great Con&s;equence</HI> of Phy&s;ic, in the <HI>practical Part</HI> of it; where Life it&s;elf is &s;o immediately at &s;take: I am per&s;uaded, they would not thus <HI>ra&s;hly</HI> venture to admini&s;ter Medi|cines, <HI>before</HI> they had acquired the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary Qualifications.</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>a mighty Mi&s;take,</HI> that has &s;eized &s;ome of our young Candidates in Phy&s;ic, who are <HI>not much addicted to Study</HI> or <HI>Pains-taking,</HI> to ima|gine: That, if they are but well furni&s;hed with <HI>Books of Recipes,</HI> they have <HI>every Qualification</HI> &s;uf|ficient to commence Doctor upon; becau&s;e in <HI>tho&s;e Books,</HI> as they think, agreeable to the com|mon Saying, they are &s;ure to find a <HI>Salve for every
<PB N="13" REF="22">Sore.</HI> But, alas! the&s;e <HI>ba&s;e, empirical Books,</HI> the Pe&s;t of the pre&s;ent Age, will <HI>greatly deceive them.</HI> They are by no means to be confided in; but, on the contrary, are rather to be looked upon as <HI>very injurious:</HI> Fora&s;much as they only furni&s;h <HI>all Sorts of People,</HI> with great Opportunities of <HI>de&s;troy|ing each other's Health.</HI> And &s;hould any Per&s;on pretend to &s;et up to practi&s;e Phy&s;ic on <HI>this deceitful Foundation,</HI> He would &s;oon find him&s;elf <HI>mi&s;erably mi&s;led;</HI> to the great and manife&s;t Injury of Him|&s;elf, as well as his Patients. For it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that <HI>every Medicine,</HI> be it never &s;o good, mu&s;t always be admini&s;ter'd in <HI>the mo&s;t proper Do&s;e,</HI> and at the <HI>mo&s;t proper Times</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, to make it of <HI>any Advantage</HI> to the Patient; but the Chance of the Mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from the <HI>con|trary Practice,</HI> no one, I think, would covet: Yet this Knowledge can no otherwi&s;e be come at, than in the <HI>arduous</HI> and <HI>diligent Manner</HI> of &s;tudy|ing above-mention'd; join'd with <HI>the Method of In|ve&s;tigating</HI> the Nature of Di&s;ea&s;es. Not that this is the <HI>only</HI> Advantage, which follows on our Do|ctrine of <HI>Inve&s;tigation;</HI> fince it not only leads us into the <HI>true Nature</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the <HI>cer|tain Method of Cure;</HI> but al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, into the <HI>very Nature</HI> and <HI>Power of Medicines them|&s;elves,</HI> if rightly attended to and applied. And were it po&s;&s;ible, even to find out an <HI>Univer&s;al Re|medy</HI> for all Di&s;tempers; it mu&s;t &s;till be &s;ubject to the <HI>due Timeing</HI> and <HI>Do&s;ing;</HI> the <HI>accurate Know|ledge</HI> of which, can no otherwi&s;e be obtained, than by the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> already laid down.

<P>HAVING thus prepared you for <HI>the Method</HI> to be ob&s;erved in <HI>finding out the Di&s;temper;</HI> I &s;hall now proceed to give it you, in the <HI>plaine&s;t,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t methodical Manner,</HI> I am able.</P>
<P>I CANNOT introduce, what I have to offer on this Head, with greater Advantage, than by laying before you, the following <HI>practical</HI> Ob&s;ervation of SCHEFFLER: <HI>Ut Rationalis Medicus curativis Sco|pis &s;atisfacere, Materias Medicas invenire, inventis rect&egrave; uti valeat: non &s;atis erit, Vires cu&s;todire, &amp; morbificas Cau&s;as amovere; &s;ed &amp; Morbi Speciem,
