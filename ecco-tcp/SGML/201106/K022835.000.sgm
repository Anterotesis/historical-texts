<HEAD>To the BOOKSELLERS of GREAT BRITAIN, Who had impo&s;ed on the Public, Stamps with the common Medi|cines, only through fear of an Exchequer Threat.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IS there occa&s;ion to addre&s;s my&s;elf once more on this mournful &s;ubject, to per&s;uade you to act as men, endowed with rea&s;on, as citizens of a free country, ble&s;&s;ed with the name of Britons? Survey your fetters, woven by imaginary power, rivetted by terror, which have di&s;graced your&s;elves, and reflect no credit either on your King or country. The Barons of the Exchequer, the guardians of con&s;titutional freedom, are now your friends; they have declared from the bench of Ju&s;tice, no &s;uch acts as the medicine act is, (which operates only by fear, in a partial manner on the &s;ubject, con|trary to the dictates of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and humanity, founded on no decree of the Legi&s;lature,) ought to exi&s;t in this land; at the &s;ame time they ob&s;erved, the more they read the act, the le&s;s they under&s;tood it, and with alacrity granted Me&s;&s;rs. Wray a new trial, who had been found guilty of the heinous crimes of &s;elling <HI>two tooth bru&s;hes</HI> with tooth powder.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, have I not rea&s;on to rejoice, have I not rea&s;on to triumph, who at the fir&s;t commencement of this ambiguous, ill-&s;hapen act, oppo&s;ed its mon&s;trous &s;tride; and who&s;e leviathan maw was only to be &s;atiated with all that a man, or a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, &s;hould hold worth pre&s;erving, viz. the honour of his King, the liberty of the &s;ubject, the dignity of his country? For the&s;e have I pleaded, for the&s;e have I braved danger, in my tracts, Advice to Book&s;ellers, Di&s;cur&s;ory Thoughts, &amp;c. How could you, ye men of books, &s;acrifice to fear your known good opinion of your Monarch? How could you believe his royal heart delighted to add di&s;tre&s;s to mi&s;ery? What have you ob&s;erved in your King, to credit the di&s;graceful &s;tory? A King &s;igning an act, that when his &s;ubject was bit by a mad dog, it demanded a tribute from the terrified &s;ufferer, or no medicine to heal his wound; or that his Maje&s;ty's finances were &s;o re+duced, as to oblige him to countenance an edict, which bows to the pro&s;titute, in plea&s;ing view; by her, that baneful cur&s;e of health &s;hall &s;pread its poignant &s;ting, which demands inevitably the &s;wift aid of medicine, fettered with a &s;tamp. Would Rome have thus chid her &s;ons who had indi&s;creetly &s;acrificed to nature's laws? No &mdash; it is only at a Stamp Office where Haman's fell principles in epitome are remembered. Can you re|concile to your minds, a King, and &s;uch a paternal King as ours is, ble&s;t with a Queen, an amiable Queen, whom even &s;lander ne'er whi&s;pered &s;urmi&s;e of ill; could her King, and our Monarch, &s;ign &s;o ungracious an act, which wre&s;ts a tax from the helple&s;s female &s;ervant, becau&s;e the imbecility of her &s;ex demands the friendly aid of me|dicine at certain times? It is not po&s;&s;ible. Can a King take again&s;t his own &s;ubjects, and exult in their mi&s;ery? Is royalty a bar to di&s;ea&s;e? Will FEVERS, GOUT, DROP|SY, CONSUMPTION, EVIL, LEPROSY, STONE, CHOLIC, &s;tand at a di&s;tance, nor dare invade the palace? Then may we &s;uppo&s;e that Kings feel not as common men. Is it not enough for human nature to bear the ills which &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;ea&s;e, or accidents cre|ate, without being tortured by forward, cruel &s;ervants of the crown, who to gratify the lu&s;t of power, trample on all laws, human and divine? Whil&s;t they reprobate a highwayman's proceedings, they act on the &s;ame principle, only diver&s;ified in the application; for have not &s;ervants of the crown demanded of you, by threats, to act contrary to the con&s;titution of this country, which militated again&s;t your&s;elves, and aggrandized your neighbour; which mu&s;t transfer your bu&s;ine&s;s to another &s;hop, where no cro&s;&s;ed &s;tamp mark'd the thre&s;hold, Who would have credited the re|port, &s;hould it have been foretold, that mini&s;ters of this country would have in|&s;i&s;ted on their &s;ervants to go round the kingdom with the Exchequer cudgel in their hand, and threaten book&s;ellers to commit an act which human nature revolts at, To refu&s;e a woman in labour a cheap medicine to ea&s;e her pains without paying for a &s;tamp. Let her die fir&s;t, is the language of the Stamp Office; or, We'll exchequer you. A|gain, find a parallel in any hi&s;tory, &s;tate, or country, of the following impo&s;t; I challenge all the antiquarians of the age to do it; a tax (proclaim not the di&s;graceful badge) which the officers of the crown of Great Britain have demanded, in the King's name, on a Pot of Ointment to cure the Itch; and in&s;i&s;ted the polluted out-ca&s;t wretch, though &s;carce cloaths to cover his nakedne&s;s, &s;hould pay Threepence for a &s;tamp, or
<PB N="3" REF="3">his di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould worry him to death; or, what would turn to a better profit for the Stamp Office, he might infect other per&s;ons, and then, joyful &s;ound, more &s;tamps would be di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the decrees, formed under the con&s;truction of the King's Stamp Office! Are the&s;e deeds proper to be ranged in the Hi&s;torian's page, as acts of George the IIId? Why, then, not procure a law, that whatever per&s;on is &s;hipwrecked on your coa&s;t, he &s;hall take &s;o many &s;tamps; or tho&s;e per&s;ons who have their hou&s;es burnt down, they &s;hall be obliged to buy your paper currency, <HI>id e&s;t</HI> &s;tamps. The&s;e acts, mini&s;ters may &s;ay, are di&s;graceful, and no nation but an abandoned one, would enact them. Are they &s;o? Not more than the imaginary medicine act, which is &s;o pious, &s;o loy|ally con&s;trued for the honour and intere&s;t of the King, and he that will not gulp the creed down, is flagelated with the Exchequer &s;courge, to urge the book&s;eller to be upon the watch; where, if he &s;ees a fellow-creature fall from his hor&s;e and brui&s;e him&s;elf, the unfortunate per&s;on mu&s;t purcha&s;e a &s;tamp before he can receive a medi|cine to &s;ooth his pain. Can there be (to Britons I appeal) a more humiliating, di&s;|graceful circum&s;tance in this country, than to &s;ee a &s;et of loyal &s;ubjects pointed at by a malignant partiality founded in a jealous &s;urmi&s;e, harra&s;&s;ed by the Stamp Office, under the &s;hadow of an act of Parliament, to commit actions which are almo&s;t as unna|tural as if they were required to &s;ell their children. Yet no act of Parliament exi&s;ts which will warrant &s;uch encroachments on the &s;ubject. For the dignity of human nature, for the honour of my King and Country, I have pleaded and oppo&s;ed the&s;e arbitrary unju&s;tifiable deeds, which heretofore were never countenanced in this or any other free country.</P>
<P>Who will join i&s;&s;ue, and &s;ay, &s;uch heavy impo&s;ts torn from the &s;ick, the lame, the di&s;ea&s;ed part of the community, are to be countenanced in this Chri&s;tian land? Not the Hou&s;e of Commons, not the Hou&s;e of Lords, not his Maje&s;ty, nor even the Hon. Wm. Pitt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, who&s;e great power &s;tands unrivalled; witne&s;s, Britons wearing a &s;tamp on their heads. Then, if there is no act of Legi&s;la|ture to ju&s;tify the&s;e &s;hameful, pilfering depredations from the people, why does a mi|ni&s;ter withhold his protection one &s;e&s;&s;ions after another from a &s;et of men, only &s;uffer|ers becau&s;e they are loyal, becau&s;e they are con&s;cientious men, becau&s;e they are fear|ful to contend with Government? Is it for the honour of a mini&s;ter to &s;port his &s;trength with the man unarmed by power, naked as to riches, and whom he can ter|rify with the anathema, wrote in Exchequer form, in like manner as the approach of a wolf &s;preads terror to the flock? Do mini&s;ters of the crown expect the people to act virtuou&s;ly, to live hone&s;tly, to po&s;&s;e&s;s integrity; let mini&s;ters look at the medicine act; there they will &s;ee oppre&s;&s;ion &s;talk with gigantic &s;tride, treading on the liberty of the &s;ubject, laughing at ju&s;tice, and &s;acrificing humanity to malignancy and avarice. Why will mini&s;ters of &s;tate form &s;uch crippled paths for the inferior ranks of man|kind to walk on? Why will not the Rulers of the nation, when they find errors in their acts of parliament, &s;hew a readine&s;s to correct them? For intere&s;t they will do it. Has, then, honour nor ju&s;tice no claim to attention? Is it not, ye guardians of the land, a &s;ore affliction to the owner of cattle, to hear his bea&s;t low with pain? Is that bea&s;t, or is an infant dying with di&s;ea&s;e, an object of taxation? I only a&s;k the que&s;tion. Are they fit objects for &s;port? If they are, throw off the ma&s;k, enact a law, that every per&s;on &s;hall con&s;ume a &s;tamp between his bread and butter every morning; or that the people inhabiting Great Britain &s;hall be bled four times a year, or take a &s;tamp. The&s;e laws, the&s;e acts, would be more honourable, more equitable, than your proceedings on the medicine act, where you doom a fellow-creature to death, rather than lo&s;e &s;elling a &s;tamp with a common medicine conveyed by a book|&s;eller, although no act of Legi&s;lature exi&s;ts to ju&s;tify &s;uch proceedings. To tax Quacks, or any other titulary traders, if hurtful to the community, I am not con|cerned; but when I ob&s;erve his Maje&s;ty's honourable Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Stamp Office breathing a language, in&s;tead of villainous deceitful Quack, it is now, Dear brother, good creature, &s;ell your medicines, &s;ell your &s;tuff, &s;ell your poi&s;ons, or what you will, only &s;ell our &s;tamps. When I hear that men in &s;o honourable a &s;tation &s;end their emi&s;&s;aries round the country, in&s;i&s;ting on book&s;ellers taking out a Five Shilling Licence, on pain of being exchequered, and oblige them to &s;ell &s;tamps, and &s;ay, you are the per&s;ons Government meant to tax, as we con&s;true it &s;o and &s;o; and at the &s;ame time let a next door neighbour &s;ell without &s;tamps, the &s;ame commo|dity; can a per&s;on, unle&s;s he is lo&s;t to all &s;eeling which adorns the &s;oul, do le&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="4">than reprobate &s;uch actions, which di&s;grace man, mar the beauty of our con&s;titu|tion, and render our Monarch the object of pity. Reflection, awake not, le&s;t thou bring to remembrance what this country was a few years back, when the people paid their taxes as chearful as one who giveth his corn to be ground and received flour in return: but now, our corn is demanded, and bran is thought a &s;ufficient recom|pence.</P>
<P>In former admini&s;trations, Ju&s;tice and Humanity adorned our &s;uperiors' councils; but now, an avaricious deceitful principle &s;ways the officers of the crown, who luxu|riou&s;ly ba&s;k in the thought of the va&s;t wedges of gold which are produced from &s;craps of paper, forgetting that the gold is wrung, from their own bankers, the people, the &s;trength of the nation; for this country, at this pre&s;ent moment, is fa&s;t con&s;uming its vital principle, on which its very exi&s;tence as a &s;tate depends; and a little time will loudly proclaim the deep decline of this once flouri&s;hing empire.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>The foregoing letter was partly printed when I read the medicine act was to be cancelled, and a new one introduced of a more exten&s;ive nature, by the Right Hon. William Pitt, Chancellor of the Exchequer. In all my &s;trictures on the act, I never dictated what I thought was proper to be done on the occa&s;ion, being per&s;uaded whenever the medicine act came to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it would at once appear with &s;uch a horrid a&s;pect, that no mini&s;ter, nor no other per&s;on who had retained the principles of honour and humanity, would patronize the act in any &s;hape.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE NEW MEDICINE ACT CONSIDERED, AS NOW SUBSTITUTED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, JULY 8, 1785.</HEAD>
<P>BY the new propo&s;ed bill as &s;tated in the public prints, I ob&s;erve the medicine act is to be equalized, the rich as well as the poor are to &s;wallow &s;tamps with their medicines, without exceptions: So far this may be thought ju&s;t. Does it alter the principles of the act? reconcile it to your minds, you who con&s;ider medicines as only articles fit for TRAFFIC I abhor the act; a tax on medicines is but a Title, but it has an object, as a warrant has, which ends with an order for the execution of a fellow creature. Does it militate again&s;t plea&s;ure? <HI>No.</HI> &mdash; Luxury? <HI>No.</HI> &mdash; Or healthy per&s;ons? <HI>No.</HI> It is an act which eyes the &s;ink of corruption &s;ettled in the limb of a fellow creature; gladdens in the reverberated &s;ound of di&s;tre&s;s. Achs, pains, and groans, are mu&s;ic to the &s;pirit of the act, they are its very life; illne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;e, are its proper food, for what is an act to rai&s;e &s;pecie without it is made pro|ductive? Frequent alarms of the people being in danger of fevers may be rai&s;ed, and the u&s;ual time of quarantine di&s;pen&s;ed with, that the plague may &s;pread its baneful in&s;luence; the wells of water contaminated; then men, women, and children will be &s;een in the &s;treets gra&s;ping medicines mo&s;t gorgeou&s;ly decorated with &s;tamps, whil&s;t the table of the illu&s;trious &s;upporters of this mo&s;t amiable chri&s;tian device, &s;hall &s;moke with the fat of veni&s;on, and rich viands grace the board, equal to the lordly De&s;pots.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who judge of the&s;e matters by what quantity of bullion this act produces, this act will not want for embelli&s;hing titles, any more than the marble monument a poli&s;h to render it plea&s;ing to the &s;ight, which covers a rotten carca&s;e. Call the medicine act by what name you plea&s;e, I will prote&s;t again&s;t it; it is armed with a &s;ting again&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, groaning under in&s;upportable agony; it is a brutal act &mdash; a brutal act did I &s;ay? &mdash; from whence borrowed we that idea? &mdash; Do brutes prey on the &s;ame denominated race? &mdash; Will lions welter in the blood of lions? <HI>No.</HI> &mdash; Will a tyger &s;eek a tyger to mangle his limbs for food? <HI>No.</HI> &mdash; Whence then the term
<PB N="5" REF="5">brutal? &mdash; Bea&s;t acts towards bea&s;t agreeable to the laws of nature; it is only man "who feeds on man," who talks of reformation, of more refined notions, yet this man, arrayed in &s;carlet or in purple, does not always remember the dignity of his &s;tation, but ferrits, tortures, nay, for intere&s;t &mdash; devours his fellow creature; then, which de&s;erves the epithet of brute mo&s;t, man or bea&s;t?</P>
<P>Such a propo&s;ed medicine act no Heathen, Jew, or Mahometan Mini&s;ter was ever re|corded to have even brooded &s;uch a dete&s;ted thought of, much more dare &s;tand up in a collective a&s;&s;embly to propo&s;e to force a tribute from women with child, children af|flicted with the &s;mall-pox, colds, &s;ore throats, convul&s;ions, and from men afflicted with ulcerated legs, from whence purulent matter ouzes in hot &s;teams &s;o virulent as to &s;cald the &s;eeming &s;ound part of the &s;kin, or with other maladies, which our tinder con&s;titutions are likely to catch, even from the air we breathe in. This glorious di&s;co|very, this friendly act of commi&s;&s;eration, which is to act as the Salvator of the nation, verging on bankruptcy, a Chri&s;tian claims the honour; not a profe&s;&s;or of the Ro|man Catholic religion; no, a purer one than that, the reformed one, a Prote&s;tant of the Church of England. Who will credit the &s;tory? Does a mini&s;ter of Great Britain (will they &s;ay,) think to impo&s;e on the King's under&s;tanding, and cloud his &s;en&s;ibility, with golden arguments, to &s;ign the decree again&s;t his doleful &s;ubjects, who &s;tand in need of all the protection, either care or power can be&s;tow, that like a &s;hip (which has been to&s;&s;ed by cro&s;s winds and &s;torms, puts into port to fit it once more to com|bat the boi&s;terous wave) they become renovated &s;o as to pur&s;ue the cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>Let foreign nations, whom yet humanity ble&s;&s;es, reject the report with &s;corn; as when a traveller relates he &s;aw a lamb for&s;ake the gra&s;s and feed on vulture's prey; if Fame, in pity to Britannia, refu&s;es to &s;ound Avarice's triumph; let Truth declare, la&s;t week the Senators of Great Britain met, where it was propo&s;ed in parlia|ment, under the &s;anction of a medicine tax, to rai&s;e &s;upplies from a &s;poil, ex|torted from his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t piteous unfortunate &s;ubjects, &s;tretched on the tenter|hook of pain, tormented with di&s;ea&s;es, which terrify the poor or rich wretch, wor&s;e than any torments Hell can inflict, as far as we know, or have a right to think. &mdash; Har&s;h and ungenerous would be the &s;ojourner's &s;urmi&s;e, whom night had overtaken in a lonely place, &s;hould he find a ho&s;pitable roof, where him&s;elf and bea&s;t are bade a hearty welcome, expre&s;&s;ed by officious care, &s;hould he imagine, all this courte|ous kindne&s;s was but a prelude to &s;ome horrid purpo&s;e, when fa&s;t in &s;leep his out|ward centinels are locked; yet thus ungrateful man oft judges of his Creator's bounty, ere he &s;heds the encumbered mantle, how will he &s;mile at his childi&s;h fears when ro|bing with immortality, whil&s;t experimentally he feels the attributes of a God.</P>
<P>A tax on illne&s;s! &mdash; Set dogs to gnaw a human creature, bears no compari&s;on to tho&s;e pains mankind feel when thus di&s;ea&s;ed, for dogs lead to mercy; in their gripe they introduce that ble&s;&s;ed friend DEATH, the great deliverer from oppre&s;&s;ion, tyran|ny, di&s;ea&s;e, and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Who can behold even a dog in pain that can avoid pity if he cannot relieve; but to &s;ee officers of the crown harra&s;&s;ing a fellow creature, worried with the evil, with a cancerous ga&s;hing wound, with a &s;cald head, a human body covered with ulcers, &s;tinking mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tfully horrible, dete&s;ted by its inmate, the &s;oul chained to &s;o vile a pe&s;tilential body, which is &s;hunned by &s;ociety, and who&s;e corrupted form breathes poi&s;onous vapours, which petrify the man by profe&s;&s;ion bred a champion in nature's cau&s;e, &mdash; walking familiar with di&s;ea&s;e, yet here pau&s;es, and &s;hrinks from power &s;o, dreadfully armed, is a &s;orry &s;ight. Whil&s;t from &s;uch di&s;ea&s;ed objects, and from di&s;|ea&s;ed cattle, a Mini&s;ter of State, with as much compo&s;ure as a rat-catcher kills vermin, meditated an act of parliament which would pointedly militate again&s;t the welfare of the human and brute creation, loaded with in&s;upportable infirmities, for he enacted that medicines of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation; which were admini&s;tered either by outward or inward application, &s;hould not be applied unle&s;s they gave a &s;tipulated &s;um for a piece of paper.</P>
<P>What is this decree but a &s;econdary one to Nebuchadnezzar's which threatened death to tho&s;e who did not bow to the idol of Gold? Yet this medicine act, under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, is far more cruel. Does Chri&s;tian power act here like a Samaritan, to pour oil into the wound? How rever&s;ed! Does it act, like the Levite and Prie&s;t, who are held up by the Saviour of the world as men actuated by &s;elfi&s;h princi|ples, void of compa&s;&s;ion? <HI>No.</HI> &mdash; The Prie&s;t and the Levite, if they did not relieve
<PB N="6" REF="6">the wounded man, were not as yet &s;uch hardened mon&s;ters as to take advantage of his di&s;tre&s;s. Formerly Kings of Albion delighted to act the phy&s;ician's part, and inve&s;ted the unhappy mortal, afflicted with the EVIL, with a piece of gold; Heaven &s;anctified the deed: Now a mini&s;ter urges his Maje&s;ty to levy on his own di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ubject a piece of money, or neither he, nor yet his bea&s;t, if ill, &s;hall be entitled to the general benefits of medicine, Heaven's gift, which by providence was de&s;igned to be as free for all nature's children as the air we breathe, or the water of the earth; the wretch who taxes one, would, could his unhumanized &s;oul find means, cur&s;e the other with his official breath &mdash; for lucre.</P>
<P>The medicine act, whil&s;t in debate, is the mini&s;ter's; but when the King &s;igns the mandate it is then cloathed with royalty, it &s;peaks maje&s;tic, and awes the &s;ubject to compliance with tremendous voice; the inhabitants of Great Britain mu&s;t hear a King &s;peak to his officers of &s;tate agreeable to the act: "Let no one of my &s;ub|jects, who are grievou&s;ly tormented with pains, mortifications, gangrene wounds, fluxes, and other deadly di&s;ea&s;es, have certain medicines they de&s;ire, unle&s;s they pay a tribute, on pain of my di&s;plea&s;ure, and the heavy penalties the act pre&s;cribes."</P>
<P>Is not this a fair delineation of the intended act? &mdash; Divines &s;ay bad thoughts and diabolical actions originate below, from whence we pretend to borrow colours to paint an infernal &s;cene; but the original de&s;ign, I am inclined to think, is too often bor|rowed from earth.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a mini&s;ter &s;hould have power to per&s;uade the King to approve of the edict &mdash; what is this edict? Man may &s;tile it a medicine act, but I call it a redemptory act &mdash; What &s;ays the act? pay a tribute, or no medicine; woe to the man who dares let any per&s;on have a medicinal packet without a &s;tamp; here is your re|demption, or rather a pa&s;&s;port to &s;hew you have the King's leave &mdash; <HI>to live</HI> &mdash; Courteous Royal beque&s;t &mdash; what wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion. Is not this the true explanation and intent of the act, fabricated in this once truly honoured i&s;land, the envy of all foreign powers? Rather than thus inflict the &s;ickly di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ubject, I a&s;k the Mini&s;ter, I a&s;k the Rt. Hon. William Pitt, whether it would not redound more to his honour as a man, as mini&s;ter of collo&s;&s;ian power, to &s;end round a party of guards to the healthy per&s;ons, and demand of them to give &s;ixpence for the emblazoned paper or put them to death, rather than go to the &s;ick man, expiring with di&s;ea&s;e, tormented with ulcers and carious bones, and in&s;i&s;t on his taking the official &s;tamps, by which the gold already produced being &s;ufficient to turn any mini&s;ter's brain, he imagines he is in character of the king's hunt&s;man, head over the hounds, hunt|ing deer in&s;tead of his Maje&s;ty's people.</P>
<P>What &s;entiments do mini&s;ters imbibe by attending a king's throne? Is the life of a Briton to be put in competition with a three-penny, &s;ix-penny, or a one &s;hilling &s;tamp? Britons! there was a time you were not held &s;o cheap; but now, if no &s;tamp at hand no medicine, or perhaps the needy &s;hopkeeper may have a &s;tamp which may be turned to money, &s;ells an old decayed medicine, which buys a loaf to feed a fami&s;hed child, whil&s;t the parent of a worthy family falls a &s;acrifice to the degenerate humanity of mini&s;ters, who enjoined a medicine to be embalmed in <HI>red &s;tripes,</HI> true emblem of the mercile&s;s act.</P>
<P>Wherewithal &s;hall a mini&s;ter find a charm to fa&s;cinate a king to &s;ign an act, which inadvertently may co&s;t hundreds of his &s;ubjects their lives? &mdash; Of what materials do mini&s;ters &s;uppo&s;e our Sovereign is compo&s;ed of? &mdash; Has not his Maje&s;ty amiable fair daughters? &mdash; Are they not women? &mdash; Are they not princely flowers nur&s;ed with peculiar &s;tate? &mdash; Yet all the care Art and Nature can be&s;tow, &s;ometimes tho&s;e pretty plants will droop, nay die. &mdash; If pain attacks them does their royal birth fortify them to be indifferent as to the effects or con&s;equences? &mdash; They are attended in &s;tately forms, phy&s;ic arrayed in pomp; do the courts of princes make the power of phy&s;i|cians equal to the de&s;ires and the nece&s;&s;ities of their royal patients? &s;uppo&s;e they do; what are the thou&s;ands of females who re&s;ide in the inferior walk of life to do, who cannot afford to charm the di&s;pen&s;er of health to vi&s;it them? &mdash; Rea&s;on and experience hint a cheap remedy, which may &s;horten their pains and re&s;tore them to health. How horrid the idea, ye &s;ervants of the crown, to take advantage of the frailties of the &s;emale &s;ex, not brought on by choice, by accident, or by remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, to rai&s;e a revenue? Is it not &s;porting with the great Creator who ordained the&s;e cau&s;es for mo&s;t impor|tant
<PB N="7" REF="7">ends, which none but fools would mention but with &s;olemnity? But to rai&s;e money under pretence of &s;upporting the honor of a King, and the dignity of the nation, by &s;uch means, who would &s;ugge&s;t and countenance?</P>
<P>To apologize for &s;uch a noxious act, &s;pecious rea&s;ons will not be wanted; money may be the mini&s;ter's plea for &s;uch an unprecedented &s;tep; it may bring in thou&s;ands of pounds to the Trea&s;ury; let it bring in more gold than all the nation's worth, not all the gold which earth can produce can wipe away the &s;tain &mdash; Great Britain barter|ing <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Humanity</HI> for <HI>Gold.</HI></P>
<P>Let mini&s;ters u&s;e all the art they are ma&s;ters of to harmoni&s;e the canibal deed, which muzzles the noble &s;cience of phy&s;ic, and proclaims in tyrannical accents to the &s;ick, "you &s;hall &s;wallow our &s;tamps, or linger under your di&s;ea&s;e;" I tru&s;t this unex|ampled mode of taxation will not find patrons in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>The Right Hon. Mr. Pitt may plead, he only corrects the medicine act, fir&s;t formed by Lord John Cavendi&s;h, again&s;t the five patent medicines, but now extends it to all medicines, pharmaceutical ones excepted. Is this ju&s;tice? why tax one medi|cine more than another, becau&s;e the one has gone through an expen&s;ive trial, before it has gained univer&s;al approbation to &s;tamp its credit as the be&s;t remedy we can a&s;certain, for &s;uch and &s;uch complaints, or for a better rea&s;on, becau&s;e ye know the afflicted will as regularly turn to the adverti&s;ed medicine for redre&s;s as the cattle go to the river to quench their thir&s;t, when the u&s;ual fountain cea&s;es to relieve their wants. Is that Mr. Pitt's excu&s;e, let him enjoy it. Let him turn his thoughts to that &s;tately monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey reared by national gratitude, to the Earl of Chat|ham, whereon is in&s;cribed, "Under who&s;e admini&s;tration Divine Providence exalted Great Britain to an height of pro&s;perity and glory unknown to any former age;" and let this que&s;tion be a&s;ked him "if it would be agreeable to his feelings as a Mini&s;ter, to the love he bears his country, to his zeal for the King's honour to let the &s;culptor add:" <HI>The &s;on of this illu&s;trious nobleman, who was Prime Mini&s;ter, propo&s;ed to his &s;ove|reign,</HI> 1785, <HI>to rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;idy under the tenor of a medicine act, from the inhabitants of Great Britain, who were afflicted with the</HI> ITCH, STONE, GOUT, LEPROSY, ULCERS, WEAK EYES, SORE THROATS, DISEASED CATTLE, <HI>and other complaints, of a nature too bad to de&s;cribe in this &s;anctuary: This &s;econd in&s;cription, which points to the lament|able changes of State Maxims and Affairs, is a memento of the &s;udden tran&s;ition of worldly</HI> GRANDEUR."</P>
<P>If the Right Hon. Mr. Pitt is not the propo&s;er, chief patron and engineer&mdash;who rai&s;es on this occa&s;ion this unnatural barrier in the afflicted's road, who wi&s;h to gain a little ea&s;e, a &s;mall re&s;pite, before they are numbered with the dead&mdash;I do mo&s;t re&s;pect|fully beg his pardon for introducing any idea that may appear per&s;onal. &mdash; The reviewers have &s;aid, I am warm on the occa&s;ion. Happy &s;hould I be, could I find a friend to prove the medicine act, bowed only to rea&s;on and good policy, not &s;wayed by lucre. At fir&s;t, the plea was, the dart was levied at Quacks, a &s;uppo&s;ed nefarious un|principled &s;et of beings. Was that the ca&s;e, how poor, how abject, a Mini&s;ter would render his Monarch to per&s;uade him to become their patron, a nominal &s;harer of the &s;poil. Is not this to a witne&s;s, <HI>a god ki&s;&s;ing carrion?</HI> To heaven I appeal, I had rather &s;ee all Quackery, or what you plea&s;e to call it, bani&s;hed from the land, than live to &s;ee a Briti&s;h State, dependent on &s;uch vile pro&s;titution to &s;upport its exi&s;t|ence as a kingdom.</P>
<P>May Heaven pre&s;erve our King in health, although his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be con&s;trained by looking through fal&s;e mediums, to extort a tax from an unfortunate yet loyal &s;ubject, becau&s;e through accident he may be bit by a mad dog, or infected with &s;ome dangerous loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE propo&s;ed medicine act, I have read; perhaps it may now lay before that venerable, truly honourable Hou&s;e of Lords, for their con&s;ideration, either to countenance or reject.</P>
<P>Cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, as if now before their Lord&s;hips, I &s;olemnly declare in my humble opinion, the medicine act as now engro&s;&s;ed, cannot with propriety be com|plied with; it requires moral impo&s;&s;ibilities, and has many ab&s;urdities; let it be tried by the penetration of wi&s;dom; it is an impolitic propo&s;al, it militates powerfully again&s;t the intere&s;t of government, and the life of the &s;ubject. Unhappy con&s;equences will prove its baneful effects; nor &s;hall I wonder when a woman's mind is agitated with the cries of her infant, &s;he &s;eeks the u&s;ual remedy on the&s;e occa&s;ions, and is told the King demands a tax for a &s;tamp, or no medicine; your child may peri&s;h. In a&s;to|ni&s;hment &s;he forgets the mother, when &s;he hears the monarch has forgot he is a father &mdash; drops her child in&s;en&s;ibly, and marks the earth with BLOOD. Is there ju&s;tice in the act?&mdash;No;&mdash;ju&s;tice is violated, the poor &s;ick man is the glorious prize which this act drags in triumph. &mdash; Will Benevolence patronize the deed?&mdash;No; &mdash; cruelty &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed. Mark the e&s;&s;ence of the words, the very criterion of the act. To tax all <HI>medicinal no&s;trums which are u&s;ed either to heal the human body by in|ternal or external application, when di&s;ea&s;ed.</HI> Heavens!!! what a crime it is now deemed to endeavour to re&s;tore health, the fountain of &s;trength and beauty to the &s;ons and daughters of the land; rather &s;ay, what a heart that man mu&s;t have, if man you can call him, who could dictate the&s;e inimical wi&s;hes, with a view to &s;tamp them into a law. Let the pro&s;ecuted wretch who &s;teals for bread, plead this illu&s;trious example of depravity in a higher power; then let government put to death the victim, and be &s;atisfied he &s;uffered ju&s;tly; in the &s;ight of his Maker, rea&s;on and equity will de|clare him murdered. Will Chri&s;tianity adopt this maxim of taxation for one of her precepts?&mdash;No,&mdash;nor no other religion in the world; nor can there be even a faint trace of any &s;tate, nation, or human being &s;o unhappily dive&s;ted of the feelings of humanity &s;ince the world began, as the authors of this uncharitable mode of taxa|tion. What is this but engrafting the tenets of an inqui&s;ition on a Briti&s;h &s;tock? Exact money, or let a per&s;on remain in torture; define it otherwi&s;e candor, if you can. Inqui&s;itors of Spain would abhor the idea of adding di&s;tre&s;s to the afflicted for the &s;ake of gain, they would abjure &s;uch a doctrine as the one now propo&s;ed by the Mini&s;ter of Great Britain; not to let a &s;ick or lame, or di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on have a medicine to remedy his pain, his complaint, and render him&s;elf once more a u&s;eful member to &s;ociety, without paying a tribute; what a language does this refined &s;y&s;tem of tax|ation di&s;play in this land, boa&s;ting of a &s;uperlative degree of piety towards God? It is an awful circum&s;tance, and a new phenomenon, to behold the hand writing of a king, acting partially to his innocent &s;ubjects, fir&s;t cut off from the general &s;ociety of the world by illne&s;s, now made the propo&s;ed objects of &s;ingular cha&s;ti&s;ement of their Sovereign. Let Britain talk no more of virtue, honour, valour, humanity, charity, or whatever enobles man, exalts a &s;tate or dignifies a king, that &s;crawl indented on the parchment, that ho&s;tile declaration again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ubjects, or what&s;oever pre&s;erves the human body from decay, if enforced, cancels all preten&s;ions to great|ne&s;s, or what&s;oever is prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>If the arguments of <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> intimately connected with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind, cannot prevail again&s;t the only &s;trong irre&s;i&s;table plea a mini&s;ter's <HI>&s;alvo</HI>&mdash;the trea&s;ury wants food,&mdash;then ye &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed victims of power be compo&s;ed, ye &s;hall on this occa&s;ion be <HI>honourably embalmed</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>royally entombed.</HI></P>
