<HEAD>THE Power of WATER-DOCK AGAINST THE SCURVY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e we, in England, call the Scurvy, and to which we are almo&s;t all &s;ubject, is often mi&s;under&s;tood where it does not appear externally; and mi&s;|managed where it does: many things being in common u&s;e as remedies, which pro|voke, and increa&s;e the di&s;order. To di&s;|clo&s;e it where it does not appear; and &s;hew
<PB N="4" REF="3">a remedy which will cure it in all ca&s;es, is the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent pamphlet.</P>
<P>Reader! be not ha&s;ty to &s;uppo&s;e it in|tere&s;ted; I &s;hall cut off that cen&s;ure in a moment. The remedy is WATER-DOCK; but it will cure as well in the PLAIN ROOT, as ESSENCE.</P>
<P>Where the Scurvy &s;hews it&s;elf upon the &s;kin, there can be no mi&s;take; but where it is latent, there may be a thou&s;and: for there is carce any di&s;ea&s;e it will not imitate. It is not a year &s;ince this medicine cured a married, hone&s;t, mi&s;erable gentleman, of pains in his legs, which he &s;uppo&s;ed venereal. More than him&s;elf had been deceived; he had e&s;tranged him&s;elf from his lady's bed, and been harra&s;&s;ed a long time with di&s;gu&s;tful methods, when this &s;imple remedy cured him without return.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach is often weak; and bitters are taken in vain: the &s;pirits are low, and recour&s;e is had to cordials, which inflame the di&s;ea&s;e; the mind is di&s;turbed, not enlivened by them, at the time; and that &s;hort unplea|&s;ant
<PB N="5" REF="4">tumult is followed by the mo&s;t &s;ad dejection.</P>
<P>Can we wonder when the di&s;ea&s;e is mi&s;|taken, the medicines don't relieve it? The effect is very different in either ca&s;e, when this &s;imple remedy is taken: the &s;tomach is at ea&s;e as &s;oon as it is &s;wallowed; the &s;pirits, though not elated, become at once compo&s;ed; and we enjoy that &s;atisfaction, which they only can value who have known the want of it; the &s;upreme plea&s;ure of tranquility. We rejoice in the pre&s;ent ce&s;&s;a|tion of the complaint; and from that fir&s;t effect of the medicine, have a right to form the mo&s;t agreeable pre&s;age of cure.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where the&s;e and other complaints from a latent Scurvy are extream in degree, and of long continuance, &s;ometimes a &s;light eruption appears upon taking the Dock: but let not this alarm the patient; he may &s;e|curely rejoice in it. It declares to a convic|tion, the true nature of his complaint; and is always &s;light, and never continues more than a few days. The &s;ame medicine which drove the humour to the &s;kin, expells it thence
<PB N="6" REF="5">by the pores, in a gentle per&s;piration; the eruption it&s;elf being in reality no more than a tumultuary and over ha&s;ty effort of nature, to throw it off that way: more being driven to the &s;kin than can find its pa&s;&s;age thence, till the farther effect of the medicine opens it a more free cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Where the di&s;order &s;hews it&s;elf on the &s;kin, and the eruption is the whole di&s;ea&s;e, the difficulty is much le&s;s: the effects of Dock are obvious; and every day &s;hews the advance made toward the cure.</P>
<P>This is obtained perfectly in a longer or &s;horter time, as the di&s;order is of more or le&s;s &s;trength and continuance. When a few heats appear upon the face, and there is no more complaint, the&s;e lo&s;e their redne&s;s, and itch|ing, every day as the medicine is continued; and by degrees vani&s;h entirely. Ten days or a fortnight u&s;ually compleat this cure.</P>
<P>If there be more of the offending humour in the blood, the&s;e heats will be longer in di&s;|appearing: and in wor&s;e ca&s;es, without due care, they will be liable to return. The
<PB N="7" REF="6">medicine is therefore to be continued longer: and if at any time, after the cure, the lea&s;t heat is felt in the &s;kin near the place where the eruptions were, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to it again. But even in the wor&s;t of the&s;e in&s;tan|ces, it is no very long continuance of the Dock that is required for the cure; and as to this re|cour&s;e to it upon returns, a few days always are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another great encouragement to &s;o much per&s;everance as is wanted. In tho&s;e con&s;iderable degrees of the di&s;order which re|quire time in their cure, the external ap|pearance is not the whole of the complaint; the removal of the before named &s;ymptoms, pain, &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;pondency, always in the&s;e ca&s;es keeps pace with the removal of the heats upon the &s;kin; and does not let the patient tire upon the medicine.</P>
<P>In the&s;e more confirmed ca&s;es, the fir&s;t effect of Dock is always throwing out more eruptions: but the patient may here al&s;o re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e will be of no continu|ance. What nature fixes on the &s;kin are, more or le&s;s, ob&s;tinate; but the&s;e which are the
<PB N="8" REF="7">plain effect of the medicine, like tho&s;e which appear for the fir&s;t time on taking it for an internal Scurvy, never remain more than a few days; and often but for few hours.</P>
<P>The plain and certain way, in which the medicine acts, is this; always con&s;i&s;tently, and always alike: its fir&s;t effort is by in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration: it opens the ob&s;tructed pores, gives pa&s;&s;age to the offending humour which is there; and throws more thither, of what was in the blood, to go off the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>If there be more of it than can be &s;o di&s;char|ged; or perhaps what is there be in its nature too gro&s;s to pa&s;s that way; there is then, in a few hours, a more than ordinary di&s;charge of urine; and in&s;tantly on this the whole frame and con&s;titution are relieved. The patient feels by the new ea&s;e and unaccu&s;tomed chearful|ne&s;s he enjoys, that he has had more of the Scurvy than was to be &s;een upon his &s;kin: and &s;ets a proper value on the means of his relief.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the effects of Water-Dock: not &s;ightly brought together, or ha&s;tily &s;et down; but what have been collected from a great
<PB N="9" REF="8">number of in&s;tances, all agreeing in the &s;e|veral particulars, and confirming one ano|ther.</P>
<P>I can therefore, without he&s;itation, boldly and certainly pronounce this medicine a re|medy for the Scurvy; in every &s;tate, condi|tion, and degree of that di&s;ea&s;e: and this with the mo&s;t perfect innocence; for it can|not repell.</P>
<P>Whatever could drive in the Scurvy would convert the milde&s;t, into the wor&s;t kind of that di&s;ea&s;e. There need no argu|ments to prove that a &s;corbutic eruption &s;truck in, would be at lea&s;t as bad as the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e naturally latent. This happens often from outward applications; of which let every one take care; and there are inward methods that may do it. I could name &s;ome mi&s;erable in&s;tances which have come within my notice afterwards: but without terrifying tho&s;e who may have thrown them&s;elves into the way of &s;uch mi&s;chief, it is enough to &s;ay that their condition is the &s;ame with theirs who have a &s;corbutic humour in the blood, which never has yet appeared; and that
<PB N="10" REF="9">this medicine is in either ca&s;e, equally a re|medy.</P>
<P>The effects I have &s;een from Water-Dock &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion. The per&s;ons afflicted with the complaint, who have taken the E&s;&s;ence under my immediate direction in the &s;pace of the la&s;t &s;even or eight years amount to a very great number; and every one of them has received a perfect cure. The words are very ab&s;olute; and may &s;eem &s;trange to per&s;ons acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, and not with this remedy; but they relate to plain facts, which have come within my own knowledge; and therefore I have a right to &s;peak them with the greate&s;t certainty and freedom: if it be otherwi&s;e, tho&s;e concern|ed mu&s;t know it; and I hope for the &s;ake of the public they will contradict me.</P>
<P>I can with equal truth declare, that I never &s;aw, or heard of the lea&s;t hurt, or inconvenience to any per&s;on, in any of the&s;e ca&s;es, from tak|ing the E&s;&s;ence of Water-Dock; though &s;o many and &s;o various. Such perfect &s;afety joined with a le&s;s degree of power might in|title a medicine to great regard: and that
<PB N="11" REF="10">perfect incapacity of doing hurt, is &s;o &s;trictly and exactly true of this, that it has pre&s;erved the &s;ame character, though taken where the Scurvy was complicated with many other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I have been the more expre&s;s in the&s;e plain a&s;&s;ertions, becau&s;e it is not long &s;ince I was told of one in&s;tance in which it was &s;aid to have di&s;agreed: I applied to the phy&s;ician who attended, and who is one of the very fir&s;t, in rank and eminence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Clifton Wintringham.</NOTE>; and he an&s;wer'd me in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute manner; that he was at a lo&s;s to know how &s;uch a re|port could take its ri&s;e; and adds, <Q>"Every &s;ugge&s;tion of that kind, &s;o far as mention has been made of it in my company, has ever been contradicted, as a circum&s;tance wholly unknown to me."</Q> He will pardon my tran&s;cribing &s;o much of his letter, as the a&s;certaining of this plain fact may be of importance to many per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Indeed, by all I have &s;een in a va&s;t variety of in&s;tances, and all I have heard from many
<PB N="12" REF="11">per&s;ons in different places, who have taken this medicine for a long time, and in great quantities, it perfectly an&s;wers the old Greek character, given of it, when the powers of herbs were better known than now: <Q>"That few medicines are more effectual, none more innocent."</Q></P>
<P>I claim no merit as a di&s;coverer of its virtues. They were known in the earlie&s;t days of literature; and have been handed down to us, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, by the be&s;t writers. All the prai&s;e that can belong to me is, that at a time when chy|mi&s;try has over-run natural phy&s;ic, I have re&s;tored its u&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many kinds of Dock, but one &s;pecies alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this great virtue: it is therefore fit it &s;hould be di&s;tinctly known; and this is ea&s;y; for it ex|ceeds the re&s;t in &s;tature as much as virtue. It grows only in wet places; not u&s;ually in
<PB N="13" REF="12">water, but always near it. The leaves are half a yard long, and of a fine plea&s;ant green; the &s;talk is &s;ix foot high, robu&s;t, erect, and crim&s;on; on its top grow &s;pikes of greeni&s;h flowers, and a&s;ter the&s;e large &s;eeds of a redi&s;h brown.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few plain characters, but there need no more; if the plant be examined by them, it cannot be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The time of the great Water-Dock's flower|ing is in June, July, and Augu&s;t: it is at that &s;ea&s;on the ea&s;ie&s;t known, but it has then little virtue: the root is the only part of u&s;e; and this mu&s;t be taken up at an earlier period.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of nature in the Plant is this: the &s;eeds which fall in autumn, produce young &s;hoots with a few &s;mall leaves only; and tho&s;e &s;oon after wither: in &s;pring more leaves ri&s;e from tho&s;e young roots, and they &s;tand the &s;ummer; and if the weather be mild, the winter al&s;o. All this time the root is in|crea&s;ing in &s;ize and virtue. The &s;talk is not to ri&s;e till the May following; and it is when nature is preparing for that great effort, but
<PB N="14" REF="13">has not yet begun it, that the root has its full virtue.</P>
<P>Therefore in the middle of April the roots &s;hould be dug up; taking only tho&s;e of a year and half's growth, and which have not yet flowered. They are at that time a foot long, and more than an inch in diameter; of a ruddy brown on the out&s;ide, and when cut of a deep orange colour. It is be&s;t to know the plant; but even if the roots be bought, they may be tru&s;ted when they have the&s;e cha|racters.</P>
<P>Beware of what are &s;old by &s;ome in the markets: they are knobby, and &s;pungy; redi&s;h not yellow within; and are the roots, not of the great Water-Dock, but of the common <HI>&s;harp-pointed Dock;</HI> a plant excellent for ointments; but internally not to be &s;poken of, in compari&s;on with the true great Water-Dock, for virtue. There is too much cau&s;e for guarding again&s;t the&s;e roots; for they come &s;ometimes &s;upported by what might be called authority. Some years &s;ince I gave a great quantity of Water-Dock-root to a coun|try practitioner, and was told afterwards that
<PB N="15" REF="14">what I &s;ent was not the right; for that the root of Water-Dock was BULBOUS. I &s;uppo&s;e the irregular &s;pungy ma&s;&s;es of the &s;harp-pointed Dock-root, had pa&s;&s;ed for bulbs; and he who made the ignorant remark, had &s;een no other.</P>
<P>When the true kind is found, and the roots of a due age are taken up, in April, they are to be wiped with a clean coar&s;e cloth, and &s;plit. The inner bark alone contains the virtue of the plant; as I have found by manifold ex|perience. Therefore the hard woody part in the middle of the root is to be taken out, as u&s;ele&s;s; and the bark being again rubbed well with the cloth, the outer rind which is thin and tender will come off, and only the u&s;eful inner bark remain. This is to be dried in an airy room where the &s;un does not &s;hine; and afterwards to be powdered.</P>
<P>In this is the whole virtue of the plant: and it is a cure for the Scurvy, even more cer|tain than the bark is for an ague. The do&s;e of the powder is one dram, and this is to be taken twice a day till the complaint is wholly removed. The ESSENCE which I direct to
<PB N="16" REF="15">be made has the &s;ame virtue. This I have contriv'd for the convenience of tho&s;e who cannot get the root; or cannot depend upon it: and if it have any advantages be|&s;ide the&s;e, it is in being more convenient, ea&s;ier to take, and performing the cure in le&s;s time. It is made from this inner bark, by a method which I have never concealed from phy&s;icians, and which I &s;hould add here, but that it would be of no u&s;e either to private families, or to the preparers of medicines; re|quiring a bark bed, &s;uch as we have in &s;toves, and other implements not u&s;ed in the com|mon operations; &s;o that it is altogether im|pu&s;&s;ible they &s;hould make it. In a few words, it is nothing more than this bark of the root, prepared before drying by a vapour|ous penetration, as gin&s;eng in China, and &s;alep in Turky; and afterwards, di&s;&s;olved by that gentle but continued heat, in a &s;pirit, of a middle degree of &s;trength, between what is called rectified, and proof.</P>
<P>This e&s;&s;ence &s;its better upon the &s;tomach than a large do&s;e of a powder; is &s;peedier in its effects; and, if I have been able to in|crea&s;e or exalt the virtues of the root by prepara|tion
<PB N="17" REF="16">it has all that advantage. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;ervations I have been obliged to &s;peak more of the e&s;&s;ence than of the root, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the cures I have named were performed with it: not from any diffidence of mine in the effect of the root it&s;elf; but from the difficulty I have found to prevail with the patient to &s;wallow &s;o large a quantity as is needful of the powder; or at be&s;t to con|tinue it a due time.</P>
<P>As to the degree of virtue in the e&s;&s;ence, a tea &s;poonful is equal to the do&s;e here mentioned of the powder.</P>
<P>What I have endeavoured is, in a few plain words, &s;upported by facts in the cour&s;e of a number of years; and of all which I believe there are living witne&s;&s;es; to &s;hew that there is no degree or kind of that di&s;ea&s;e we call the Scurvy, but may be cured with cer|tainty by this &s;imple medicine; and that the u&s;e of it is free even from the po&s;&s;ibility of harm. There requires no &s;kill in phy&s;ic, to know that nothing can do hurt in the Scurvy unle&s;s it can repell; and that is a quality not
<PB N="18" REF="17">only not exi&s;ting in the Dock; but perfectly contradictory to its nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>NO particular regimen, or cour&s;e of life, is required on account of this medi|cine, nor any preparation of the body for it: nay, the&s;e things are not only needle&s;s, but I have found them hurtful. Bleeding tends to draw in that humour which it is our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to keep out, &s;o long as any of it remains in the con&s;titution; and purges have &s;ome|times brought on di&s;orders in the bowels, which nothing could relieve. I am afraid many lives have been lo&s;t this way, when the true cau&s;e was never once &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have always begun the cure with this medicine, without any thing of what is called preparation; and in&s;tead of directing a &s;trict manner of life, I have, in all common ca&s;es, de&s;ired the patient to live in his u&s;ual way. Tho&s;e are fallacious cures which depend upon a reduced diet; and I
<PB N="19" REF="18">have always found, that when the per&s;on &s;o relieved returned to his former method of living, the di&s;ea&s;e returned al&s;o; and often with more violence.</P>
<P>There are, however, certain general rules, which people of &s;corbutic habits ought al|ways to ob&s;erve. The&s;e do not relate &s;o much to diet, as to other particular circum|&s;tances and accidents of life; and the&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to lay down for the &s;ervice of the patient: not from what has been written by others; for what with the con|fu&s;ion of names and mi&s;con&s;truction of &s;ymp|toms, I think no di&s;ea&s;e has been treated &s;o imperfectly; but from the condition of tho&s;e who have been under my care, and the par|ticular things which I have found mo&s;t to re|lieve or hurt them.</P>
<P>A good air is of great u&s;e in the cure of ever di&s;ea&s;e, but of none more than this. People who live in low and mar&s;hy grounds, always require more time in the cure of the &s;ame degree of Scurvy, than &s;uch as breathe a dryer and purer air.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P>Tho&s;e who live in &s;alt mar&s;hes are very &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;e, and yet more difficult of cure. It is not meant that people cannot be cured who are fixed by their way of life and circum&s;tances in the&s;e places; but they mu&s;t expect their relief to be more tedious: let tho&s;e to whom it is indifferent where they live, if they have any cau&s;e even to &s;u&s;pect the Scurvy, remove from them.</P>
<P>Air that is fouled by the breath and per|&s;piration of many per&s;ons kept clo&s;e toge|ther, is yet much more hurtful: it is for this rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e that few are cured of the Scurvy in an ho&s;pital; indeed if it were po&s;&s;i|ble more care ought to be taken of the air in the&s;e charities; for be&s;ides rendering this di&s;ea&s;e untractable, they often bring on hec|tics and con&s;umptions, in tho&s;e who el&s;e would not have fallen into them.</P>
<P>It is in the&s;e bad airs, and almo&s;t in the&s;e on|ly, that I have found the extreme degrees of the Scurvy, in the inhabitants of &s;alt mar&s;hes, of|fen&s;ive breath and decaying teeth are common &s;ymptoms; and in ho&s;pitals the eruptions,
<PB N="21" REF="20">which would naturally have been followed only by a dry &s;curf or &s;cale, have fixed into moi&s;t and permanent &s;ores.</P>
<P>Even in the wor&s;t ca&s;es of the mar&s;h Scurvy, I have &s;een this medicine cure; and it is particular that nature, the God of na|ture, who does nothing in vain, has fixed the plant in tho&s;e grounds mo&s;t abundantly; that the &s;oil, together with the mi&s;chief, might bring forth the remedy.</P>
<P>A &s;edentary life is another great cau&s;e of mi&s;chief from the Scurvy. Exerci&s;e not only carries off a great deal of this trouble&s;ome humour, &s;o univer&s;al in our con&s;titution, but drives out a great deal more; and where the taint is in the blood, the next good to di&s;|charging it, is keeping it upon the &s;urface. It di&s;gu&s;ts and teazes there; but it de&s;troys within.</P>
<P>A red face or cru&s;ted arms or legs, or fiery pimples on the back or brea&s;t, are the mo&s;t u&s;ual troubles that attend the Scurvy, with a life of exerci&s;e; but the&s;e eruptions being out, the patient enjoys health and &s;pirits, nay, the
<PB N="22" REF="21">more out, the more; and add to this, the cure is much the ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the &s;ame degree of the &s;corbutic mi&s;chief in the con&s;titution of a lazy or over attentive man; a voluptuary, or a &s;cho|lar, who, doating on his clo&s;et, or his ea&s;y chair, gives nature no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in di&s;charging, or but attempting to di&s;charge it; preys in|wardly, and brings on a long and mi&s;erable train of &s;ymptoms; often mi&s;called by the names of other di&s;ea&s;es, but its legitimate offspring.</P>
<P>That the unhappy patient of this charac|ter may know his ca&s;e, and avoid at lea&s;t the mi&s;ery of mi&s;taken applications, I &s;hall lay down a detail of them.</P>
<P>His nights are pa&s;&s;ed either with perplex|ing dreams or tire &s;ome watchfulne&s;s; in the morning he feels a dryne&s;s of the throat, diffi|culty of breathing, and a confu&s;ed numbne&s;s in the head; till a great deal of tea, or &s;ome other weak warm liquor, di&s;&s;olve the concre|tions of the night, and bring on a &s;light, un|certain, &s;hort relief.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<P>Soon after this, as the weather, diet of the preceding day, or &s;ome other accidental cau&s;e determines, come one or other of the following &s;ymptoms; and &s;ometimes &s;everal of them together; a pain under the brea&s;t, a &s;ul|len head-ach, drow&s;ine&s;s, a &s;welled &s;tomach, and now and then a dread of &s;uffocation; de|jection of &s;pirits, with a mi&s;erable want of &s;trength and vigour; palpitation of the heart, with flutterings, and tremblings of the limbs, not permanent, but returning on the mo&s;t &s;light occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a kind of tran&s;itory &s;ymptoms, which from time to time take the place of one another; but there are &s;ome al&s;o which are continual. The&s;e are weakne&s;&s;es of the &s;tomach and a want of appetite, hiccups and &s;our belchings, wandering pains, and &s;ometimes a peculiar cough, on which the common medicines take little effect.</P>
<P>At times a pricking pain is felt in many parts of the fle&s;h and an itching of the ears and gums, a heat and dryne&s;s in the hands
<PB N="24" REF="23">and feet, and flu&s;hings in the face with a kind of burning.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t are efforts nature makes in cer|tain favourable circum&s;tances to throw out the humour, or at lea&s;t to tell the patient the true nature of his illne&s;s: they &s;hould be at|tended to with care, and &s;eized with eager ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, and the cure attempted immediate|ly by medicine; for this will take tenfold effect when nature thus a&s;&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Let no one &s;light her notices; they are always true, and often critical. I have &s;een cures performed under &s;uch circum&s;tances in &s;o little time, and with &s;o perfect a &s;uc|ce&s;s, as has exceeded all expectation: and on the contrary it mu&s;t not be concealed, that I have &s;een upon the neglect of the&s;e friendly in|timations, this latent Scurvy change into &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e of a much more terrible nature. In young people epileptic fits are &s;ometimes the con&s;equence; in tho&s;e advanced in years a &s;ettled comato&s;e &s;tupidity; and often inflam|mations of the vi&s;cera, which medicines try to a&s;&s;uage in vain. When the efforts of na|ture are &s;econded by this medicine, the cure is
<PB N="25" REF="24">always particularly ea&s;y; nay, the mi&s;chiefs brought on by neglect, are al&s;o remedied by it.</P>
<P>One very particular ca&s;e of this kind came &s;ome time ago within my knowledge. A per|&s;on of the middle time of life, a gentleman and a &s;cholar, accu&s;tomed to the common &s;ymptoms of a latent Scurvy, felt all at once, one morning as he was writing, a flu&s;hing in his face, a tingling in his back, his arms, and legs, and burning heat in his feet; in|&s;omuch that he could not &s;it; but ri&s;ing in great unea&s;ine&s;s, rambled an hour or more about the apartment. In this time all the &s;ymptoms went off, except the burning in his feet, which la&s;ted till theevening. The event was very &s;ingular. He then felt him&s;elf un|u&s;ually hungry, and complained of a gnawing at his &s;tomach, which was too impatient for the &s;upper of the family, and forced him to call for any thing that was in readine&s;s. He eat va&s;tly more than he had ever done at once; nay, as him&s;elf &s;ays, more than he ever eat at three times in his life, and yet in the cour&s;e of the night, he grew hungry again.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>From this time a ravenous appetite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him for &s;everal years: he who had u&s;ed to eat le&s;s than mo&s;t people, devoured as much as three or four; and even this without &s;a|tiety. The name of a canine appetite is bet|ter known than the cure: his country apo|thecary, a very able man, gave every thing that is u&s;ual without effect; at length to blunt, if it were po&s;&s;ible, the keenne&s;s of this everla&s;ting craving, he took every day half an hour before dinner and &s;upper, a draught compo&s;ed of two ounces and a half of oil of almonds, with &s;ome mar&s;hmallow &s;yrup. This cured him of the gravel, to which he had long been &s;ubject; but as to the com|plaint for which he took it, that remained as it was. This particular medicine for &s;o uncommon a di&s;ea&s;e, I have mentioned the more expe&s;sly, becau&s;e though not &s;ucce&s;s|ful in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the apothecary had &s;een it in another perform a cure, under the hands of a phy&s;ician of great character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Alexander Stuart, phy&s;ician to the late queen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On his applying to me, I advi&s;ed the Wa|ter-Dock; the origin of the complaint ap|pearing
<PB N="27" REF="26">plainly to be a &s;corbutic humour, which nature not being able to throw out, had fixed upon the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>As the long burning of the feet &s;hewed the great effort for per&s;piration to have been made there, I directed him to wear woollen under|&s;tockings, and to line his &s;hoes with flannel. The event ju&s;tified my opinion: a &s;light red|ne&s;s appeared upon his cheeks &s;oon after taking the Dock, and the voraciou&s;ne&s;s of appetite cea&s;ed. The redne&s;s of the cheeks la&s;ted about a fortnight; and he is now well. The medicine in this ca&s;e, having taken away the exce&s;s of hunger, though in all others I have &s;een it has increa&s;ed the appetite.</P>
<P>There is another thing which it grieves me to accu&s;e, and yet it mu&s;t be named, nay and &s;trict caution mu&s;t be given again&s;t it, as injurious in the Scurvy: this is &s;tudy. The plea&s;ure of reading is not the thing meant here; but that fixed attention of mind which accompanies the re&s;earches into &s;cience. The mathematics are of the number of the&s;e &s;tudies, and that extent of mind, by which men have &s;ometimes endeavoured to compre|hend
<PB N="28" REF="27">within one view the whole of vi&s;ible created beings, and by arranging them in their true place, to under&s;tand as it were the purpo&s;es of God.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;tudies under which the mind, fixed to one point, conver&s;ing in it&s;elf, and bu&s;ied with its own ideas, forgets the body: and in the&s;e ca&s;es the body always langui&s;hes; and often in the end peri&s;hes entirely. The&s;e men &s;eem to act every day the la&s;t &s;cene of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> and bid death &s;tay, as he bad the &s;oldier, till they have fini&s;hed the demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of this kind de&s;erve our admoni|tions mo&s;t of all men; and they want them mo&s;t: nor do they ever need them more than when they have a &s;corbutic taint in the blood: for under this cour&s;e of life it is always latent. I have been willing to think that it was not the effect of &s;tudy, but the want of exerci&s;e attendant on this kind of life, that gave &s;o much occa&s;ion to di&s;orders; but in&s;tances have come before me proving it otherwi&s;e; and I think one of the mo&s;t ob&s;ti|nate ca&s;es that ever I have known was of a
<PB N="29" REF="28">geometrician, whom I directed to u&s;e exerci&s;e as much as could be needful, but in vain.</P>
<P>I dare not rank my&s;elf among &s;uch men as the&s;e; but &s;ince no experience is &s;o certain as that one feels within ones own body, I &s;hall venture to add, in confirmation of this, that notwith&s;tanding all the exerci&s;e I have been able to take, and of every other good regula|tion that I know, about two months &s;ince, while I was intent upon arranging plants in the method of nature, a &s;corbutic humour which had never before been very trouble-&s;ome to me, grew to &s;uch a height, that it re|quired a five weeks cour&s;e of Dock, and I take it in large do&s;es too, to get the better of it.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, and the founda|tion of &s;o much experience; which I am very &s;ure has been carefully attended; I may pro|po&s;e &s;ome general rules of life, which will be &s;erviceable to all &s;corbutic patients, whether they undertake their cure by this remedy or by any other; or whether they leave them|&s;elves, as many do, to nature and a vain hope from time. This hope deceives them always;
<PB N="30" REF="29">for how&s;oever the di&s;ea&s;e may more or le&s;s appear, yet wherever it is in the con&s;titu|tion, it will, while neglected, be gathering &s;trength; and what is wor&s;e, the older we grow always the more tedious will be the cure.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing then to be &s;ought by the &s;corbutic patient is a good air, and of all good qualities the greate&s;t in this ca&s;e is that it be dry. The &s;ide of a hill, upon a gravelly &s;oil, with a We&s;t a&s;pect, is the mo&s;t de&s;irable; the top of a hill, or an expo&s;ure without &s;helter to the North, I have always found tend to fixing eruptions upon the face, or other uncovered parts of the body.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e proportioned to the &s;trength, and at the be&s;t hours of the day, will prove highly &s;erviceable; and mo&s;t of all &s;o in a cour&s;e of the E&s;&s;ence of Water-Dock. Walking or riding out always after taking the do&s;e; which therefore &s;hould be taken in the&s;e ca&s;es at hours mo&s;t proper for exerci&s;e. This in|crea&s;es that per&s;piration which the Dock na|turally brings on; and, with care not to get cold after it, will make one do&s;e as effectual as two or three.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<P>The amu&s;ement of reading will be as u&s;e|ful, as too much fixed attention would be bad; always being upon the guard that this does not intrench upon the hours of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Meats ea&s;ie&s;t of dige&s;tion are be&s;t: the le&s;s of &s;alted things are eat, at any time the better; but during the u&s;e of any medicine for the cure of this complaint, &s;uch things &s;hould be more particularly avoided.</P>
<P>Pepper is be&s;t let alone, and &s;pirituous li|quors, which inflame the di&s;order, always; and in many in&s;tances fix it in the face, in the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome manner. As to wine and malt liquors no cure of the &s;curvy, as has before been &s;aid, will ever be la&s;ting, which depends upon the ab&s;taining from the&s;e; for upon the return to them the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf will follow.</P>
<P>This is the general &s;tate of &s;corbutic di&s;or|ders, and their cure; but in this di&s;ea&s;e as in all others, there will be here and there a &s;ingular in&s;tance; where either from the natural con|formation of the &s;kin, peculiar in &s;ome parti|cular &s;ubjects, or from an hereditary, or per|haps
<PB N="32" REF="31">a mixt taint in the blood, a more than ordinary ob&s;tinacy is found in the complaint: but even in the&s;e, of &s;o many of them as have come before me, I never have found the addition of any other medicine nece&s;&s;ary. A warm bath has &s;ometimes opened the way to a cure; and if the fair beginning made by that has &s;eemed to fail afterwards, I have known a flannel wai&s;tcoat next the &s;kin an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Once, and only once, I have &s;een a ca&s;e where nothing but ab&s;taining from meat, and fermented liquors, would give the medicines their due efficacy; and when the cure was thus obtained, I was in con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of a return upon the u&s;ual cour&s;e of life being re&s;umed. But this was done very gradually; the Dock being at times continued; and the patient, though near three years are now pa&s;|&s;ed &s;ince, continues well.</P>
