<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE <HI>LONDON</HI> INFIRMARY.</HEAD>
<P>_OF all Circum&s;tances that affect the Mind of Man with Compa&s;&s;ion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for the In&s;titu|tion.</NOTE> no one &s;eems to touch it &s;o nearly as the &s;eeing our Fellow-Creatures labouring with Di&s;ea&s;es, and even peri&s;hing under them for want of proper and timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for who that is not &s;avage in Nature can pa&s;s regardle&s;s by tho&s;e Numbers of mi&s;erable Objects, who daily pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, and who&s;e various Di&s;ea&s;es (were all other Motives &s;ilent) would be as &s;o many Tongues, which at once &s;peak their own Angui&s;h and ex|cite our Pity. As the Characteri&s;tick of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is to be humane and beneficent, &s;o no|thing
<PB N="2" REF="3">&s;hews it more than In&s;titutions of a pub|lick Nature, &s;uch as Ho&s;pitals and Infirmaries, which are here better regulated and &s;upplied with Nece&s;&s;aries, than in any other Country what|&s;oever. Some there are of Royal Endowment, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Revenue, and others of more modern In&s;titution, erected and &s;upported by the generous and voluntary Contributions of good and well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons; but all the&s;e are by Experience known to be no ways ade|quate to the Numbers that &s;eek A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them; for as they can take in no more Patients than they have Beds, or give Medicine to more than what their Income will allow, many poor unhappy Creatures mu&s;t be unavoidably lo&s;t. For 'tis a Truth well known, that tho' the City of <HI>London</HI> is more populous, and by its Trade and Navigation, the labouring Part thereof are more &s;ubject to Accidents and Di&s;ea&s;es than the common People of <HI>Paris;</HI> yet it appears from the annual printed Accounts, that the <HI>Hotel Dieu</HI> alone contains more Patients at one time than all our Ho&s;pitals and Infirmaries together. If &s;uch Provi&s;ion is made for the di&s;ea&s;ed Inhabi|tants of <HI>Paris,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>London</HI> more imme|diately require our Regard; particularly, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacturers and Seamen, as they are
<PB N="3" REF="4">the chief Support of both our foreign and do|me&s;tick Trade.</P>
<P>The Strength and Security of <HI>Great Britain</HI> depending chiefly on its Naval Power, the Wi&s;|dom of the Legi&s;lature has &s;hewed a peculiar Concern for the Comfort and Happine&s;s of &s;uch infirm and di&s;abled Seamen as have been en|gaged in the Service of the Royal Navy: But for Seamen imployed only in the Service of the Merchant, and trading Part of the Kingdom, or the Wives and Families of &s;uch, in Di&s;tre&s;s by Sickne&s;s, no de&s;irable Publick Provi&s;ion has yet been made, or <HI>particularly</HI> in&s;tituted for their Relief. Nor are our numerous, poor, in|du&s;trious Manufacturers, and Artificers, or their Wives and Children, by any particular Dona|tions or E&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ufficiently provided for, under the Calamity of bodily Di&s;ea&s;es and Ca|&s;ualties; tho' in &s;uch afflicting and melancholy Circum&s;tances, they are incapable of providing for them&s;elves or Families by their u&s;ual Labour and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations have induced many be|nevolent and publick &s;pirited Noblemen, Gen|tlemen, Merchants and others to turn their Thoughts upon rai&s;ing by publick Sub&s;cription, a LONDON-INFIRMARY, where <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sailors in
<PB N="4" REF="5">the Merchants Service, their Wives and Chil|dren; and poor <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacturers, their Wives and Children; are daily admitted, and find Relief, in Di&s;tre&s;s by Sickne&s;s or Ca&s;ualties: And this without any Difficulty or Expence of Admittance.</P>
<P>In order to an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> <HI>a large Hou&s;e was taken in</HI> Pre&s;cot-Street, Good|man's-Fields, which Situation was judged the mo&s;t convenient, as being near the u&s;ual A|bodes of Manufacturers and Seafaring Men in the Merchants Service, and at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from any Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is &s;pacious and convenient,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulation of the Hou&s;e.</NOTE> con|tains about forty Beds, properly and airily di&s;|po&s;ed, is furni&s;hed with Linnen, and all ne|ce&s;&s;ary Conveniencies. The <HI>Matron,</HI> a &s;ober and di&s;creet Woman, has the Charge of the Hou&s;e and Furniture; the Direction of the Nur&s;es, and other Servants; and &s;ees the Diet and Medicines admini&s;tred according to Order. Under her, are Nur&s;es, and Watchers, in pro|portion to the Number of Patients, of experi|enced Hone&s;ty and Tenderne&s;s, who are guided by written Orders to prevent Mi&s;conduct of any kind. Proper Diet for the Patients has been &s;ettled by the Gentlemen of the Faculty
<PB N="5" REF="6">engaged in this Charity, and is fixed up in the Wards for the Satisfaction of the Patients and their Friends.</P>
<P>A <HI>Phy&s;ician and Surgeon</HI> of Reputation are appointed, and attend daily,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phy&s;icians and Surgeons.</NOTE> from Eleven to One, without any Fee or Reward, and give their Advice to all &s;uch poor di&s;ea&s;ed Objects as think proper to come in tho&s;e Hours, whe|ther recommended or not; and other Phy&s;i|cians and Surgeons of Character attend and ad|vi&s;e in all dangerous or extraordinary Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI> is furni&s;h'd with Drugs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;pen&s;ary.</NOTE> which being fir&s;t viewed and reported Good by a Committee for that Purpo&s;e, are bought at the be&s;t hand, and compounded at the <HI>Infirmary,</HI> where an Apothecary Re&s;ides, who con&s;tantly and &s;olely attends the Bu&s;ine&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>No Officers or Servants are permitted upon Pain of Expul&s;ion to take of any Trade&s;men, Patients, or other Per&s;ons, any Fee, Reward, or Gratification of any kind, directly or indi|rectly, for any Service done, or to be done, on Account of this Infirmary.</P>
<P>And as the Governors of this Charity are de|&s;irous that the utmo&s;t Regard may be had to the Souls of the Patients,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chaplain.</NOTE> as well as their Bo|dies, a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England</HI> has generou&s;ly undertaken, without any Gra|tuity,
<PB N="6" REF="7">to read Prayers, and perform the other Duties of his Function, at the <HI>Infirmary.</HI></P>
<P>Every Sub&s;criber of five Guineas Yearly is a Governor of this Charity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualification of a Gover|nor.</NOTE> and is intitled to &s;end in as many Patients as there are Vacancies of Beds; but if they can't be received as In-Patients, they are relieved as Out-Patients. Every Gentleman giving a Benefaction of thirty Guineas at once, will be a Governor for Life.&mdash;All Sub&s;criptions are during Plea&s;ure, and &s;maller Sums, from well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, will be thankfully receiv'd and acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>Four Governors in Rotation every Month,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu&s;ine&s;s of Governors.</NOTE> with any others that are plea&s;ed, attend Weekly, in order to receive, and di&s;mi&s;s Patients, &s;upervi&s;e the Proceeding of the Hou&s;e, and do &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s as is u&s;ually done by Committees at other Ho&s;|pitals, and report the &s;ame at the next Quar|terly or General Meeting. There is a General Meeting of the Governors every Quarter, before whom a Report is made from the Weekly Committees, all By-Laws are then Confirm'd, all Vacancies fill'd up, and Accounts Audited. Al&s;o an Annual General Meeting of all Sub|&s;cribers to Revi&s;e and Confirm the General Account of Proceedings, which will immedi|ately after be publi&s;h'd for the Satisfaction of the Publick.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P>The Accounts are kept in a regular mercan|tile Manner, and the Names of the Patients, their Employment, Place of Abode, Di&s;order, the I&s;&s;ue of the Ca&s;e, and the Name of the Sub&s;criber who &s;ent them, are in&s;erted in &s;e|veral Columns in a Book for that Purpo&s;e; and are always ready for the In&s;pection of Sub|&s;cribers, as al&s;o the Statutes and By-Laws for the particular Regulation of this <HI>Infirmary.</HI></P>
<P>All poor, &s;ick, and lame,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proper Ob|jects.</NOTE> who are recom|mended, or appear to the Committee to be truly nece&s;&s;itous, are received from the Hours of Eleven to One, who are &s;upply'd with Ad|vice, Medicine, Diet, Wa&s;hing, Lodging, and every comfortable A&s;&s;i&s;tance during their Cure. No Per&s;ons with incurable or infectious Di&s;|tempers, or of known Ability to pay for their Cures, are admitted to partake of this Charity; but all Accidents are received at any Hour of the Day or Night.</P>
<P>This is the Plan of our Proceedings, and tho' this Work is but in its Infancy, yet &s;uch has been the extraordinary Encouragement given to it, by Numbers of Di&s;tingui&s;h'd Humanity, that we have the Satisfaction to a&s;&s;ure the Pub|lick, that &s;ince the 3d of <HI>November,</HI> 1740, it has plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s us with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that upwards of 2000 di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Objects have
<PB N="8" REF="9">been Relieved at the <HI>London Infirmary,</HI> and from Labouring under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the mo&s;t malignant Di&s;ea&s;es, and unhappy Accidents, have been re-in&s;tated in their Ho|ne&s;t and Indu&s;trious Capacities of Working; whereby the Publick again enjoy the Benefit of their Labour; They, and their poor Families pre&s;erved from Peri&s;hing, and prevented from being a con&s;tant Incumbrance to the Commu|nity.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;cribers are de&s;ired to take Notice, that if any Patients &s;hall not conform to the Rules of the Hou&s;e, or are guilty of any Mi&s;|behaviour, they will be di&s;charged for &s;uch Ir|regularity, and never more relieved by this Cha|rity.</P>
<P>There was a Propo&s;al in the <HI>Daily Adver|ti&s;er</HI> of the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> 1738, for erecting an <HI>Ho&s;pital, Infirmary, Surgery, Chappel,</HI> and <HI>School,</HI> for relieving of poor, aged, and other|wi&s;e di&s;abled Seamen in the Merchants Service, their Wives and Children, by a Sub&s;cription to be &s;et on Foot among&s;t the Merchants, Owners, Ma&s;ters, and Officers of Ships, and common Seamen, who were to pay certain Quarterly Sums according to their &s;everal Ranks, which, with the Contributions of worthy People, might have been &s;ufficient for the de&s;ired End: As
<PB N="9" REF="10">the <HI>London Infirmary</HI> already begun, is calcu|lated to relieve all tho&s;e who are di&s;abled by Sickne&s;s or Accidents, and their Wives and Children, and an&s;wers that Propo&s;al in Part, and may be the Foundation of the Whole, we hope tho&s;e who had &s;o charitably join'd in &s;up|porting that Sub&s;cription, will as readily intere&s;t them&s;elves in this, which, if it plea&s;es God to continue his Favour and pro&s;per the Undertak|ing, may in time, by &s;uch Encouragement, be extended to the whole Benefit propo&s;ed by that Adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P REND="italic">Such Per&s;ons therefore as are inclined to en|courage and promote &s;o laudable a Work, are de&s;ired to &s;end their Sub&s;criptions or Benefactions to Mr. <HI>Thomas Minors,</HI> Banker, in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> who will give proper Receipts for the &s;ame: And any Per&s;on in|clined by his la&s;t Will to bequeath a Legacy to this Charity, is de&s;ired to direct it to be paid to the Trea&s;urer for the Time being, of the <HI>London Infirmary</HI> in <HI>Goodman's Fields,</HI> and that his Receipt &s;hall be a good Di&s;|charge for the &s;ame.</P>
