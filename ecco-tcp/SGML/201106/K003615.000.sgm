<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF FACTS AND OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE my former publications on the Vaccine Inoculation, I have had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing it extend very widely. Not only in this country is the &s;ubject pur&s;ued with ardour, but from my corre&s;pondence with many re&s;pectable medical gentlemen on the Continent, (among whom are <HI>Dr. De Carro</HI> of Vienna, and <HI>Dr. Ballhorn</HI> of Hanover) I find it is as warmly adopted abroad, where it has afforded the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. I have
<PB N="6" REF="4">the plea&s;ure too of &s;eeing that the feeble efforts of a few in|dividuals to depreciate the new practice, are &s;inking fa&s;t into contempt beneath the immen&s;e ma&s;s of evidence which has ri&s;en up in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>Upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons have now been inoculated with the virus of Cow Pox, and the far greater part of them have &s;ince been inoculated with that of Small Pox, and expo&s;ed to its infection in every rational way that could be devi&s;ed, with|out effect.</P>
<P>It was very improbable that the inve&s;tigation of a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o analagous to the Small Pox, &s;hould go forward without engaging the attention of the Phy&s;ician of the Small Pox Ho&s;pital in London.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Dr. Woodville, who fills that department with &s;o much re&s;pectability, took an early opportunity of in&s;tituting an Inquiry into the nature of the Cow Pox. This Inquiry was began in the early part of the pre&s;ent year, and in May, Dr.
<PB N="7" REF="5">Woodville publi&s;hed the re&s;ult, which differs e&s;&s;entially from mine in a point of much importance. It appears that three-fifths of the patients inoculated were affected with eruptions, for the mo&s;t part &s;o perfectly re&s;embling the Small Pox, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from them. On this &s;ubject it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould make &s;ome comments.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider that out of the great number of Ca&s;es of ca&s;ual inoculation immediately from cows; which have from time to time pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my ob&s;ervation, and the many &s;imilar in&s;tances which have been communicated to me by medical gentlemen in this neighbourhood; when I con|&s;ider too that the matter with which my inoculations were conducted in the years 1797, 98, and 99, was taken from different cows, and that in no in&s;tance any thing like a vario|lous pu&s;tule appeared, I cannot feel di&s;po&s;ed to imagine that eruptions, &s;imilar to tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Dr. Woodville, have ever been produced by the <HI>pure uncontaminated Cow Pock virus:</HI> on the contrary, I do &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e which the Doctor &s;peaks of, originated in the action of variolous matter,
<PB N="8" REF="6">which crept into the con&s;titution with the vaccine. And this I pre&s;ume happened from the inoculation of a great number of the patients with variolous matter (&s;ome on the third, others on the fifth day) after the vaccine had been applied; and it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the matter thus propagated became the &s;ource of future inoculations in the hands of many medical gentlemen who appeared to have been previou&s;ly unacquainted with the nature of the Cow Pox.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance &s;trongly, in my opinion, &s;upporting this &s;uppo&s;ition, is the following: The Cow Pox has been known among our dairies time immemorial. If pu&s;tules then, like the variolous, were to follow the communication of it from the cow to the milker, would not &s;uch a fact have been known, and recorded at our farms? Yet, neither our farmers nor the medical people of the neighbourhood have noticed &s;uch an occurrence.</P>
<P>A few &s;cattered pimples I have &s;ometimes, though very rarely &s;een, the greater part of which have generally di&s;appeared
<PB N="9" REF="7">quickly, but &s;ome have remained long enough to &s;uppurate at their appex. That local cuticular inflammation, whether &s;pring|ing up &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or ari&s;ing from the application of acrid &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as <HI>Cantharides, Pix Burgundica, Antimonium Tartarizatum,</HI> &amp;c. will often produce cutaneous affections, not only near the &s;eat of the inflammation, but on &s;ome parts of the &s;kin far beyond its boundary, is a well-known fact. It is, doubtle&s;s, on this principle that the inoculated Cow-pock pu&s;tule and its concomitant efflore&s;cence may in very irritable con&s;titutions produce this affection. The eruption I allude to, has commonly appeared &s;ome time in the third week after inoculation. But this appearance is too trivial to excite the lea&s;t regard.</P>
<P>The change which took place in the general appearance during the progre&s;s of the vaccine inoculation at the Small Pox Ho&s;pital &s;hould likewi&s;e be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Although at fir&s;t it took on &s;o much of the variolous character as to produce pu&s;tules in three Ca&s;es out of five, yet in Dr.
<PB N="10" REF="8">Woodville's la&s;t report, publi&s;hed in June, he &s;ays, "&s;ince the publication of my reports of inoculations for the Cow Pox, upwards of three hundred Ca&s;es have been under my care; and out of this number, only thirty-nine had pu&s;tules that &s;up|purated: viz. out of the fir&s;t hundred, nineteen had pu&s;tules; out of the &s;econd, thirteen; and out of the la&s;t hundred and ten, only &s;even had pu&s;tules. Thus it appears that the di&s;ea&s;e has become con&s;iderably milder; which I am inclined to at|tribute to a greater caution u&s;ed in the choice of the matter, with which the infection was communicated; for lately, that which has been employed for this purpo&s;e has been taken only from tho&s;e patients in whom the Cow Pox proved very mild and well characteri&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a few weeks after the Cow Pox inoculation was introduced at the Small Pox Ho&s;pital, I was favoured with &s;ome virus from this &s;tock. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance it produced a few pu&s;tules, which did not maturate; but in the &s;ub&s;e|quent ca&s;es none appeared. E. J.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The inference I am induced to draw from the&s;e premi&s;es is very different. The decline, and finally, the total extinction nearly of
<PB N="11" REF="9">the&s;e pu&s;tules, in my opinion, are more fairly attributable to the Cow Pox virus, a&s;&s;imilating the variolous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In my fir&s;t publication on this &s;ubject, I expre&s;&s;ed an opinion that the Small Pox and the Cow Pox were the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es under different modifications. In this opinion Dr. Woodville has concurred. The axiom of the immortal Hauter, that <HI>two di&s;ea&s;ed actions cannot take place at the &s;ame time in one and the &s;ame part,</HI> will not be injured by the admi&s;&s;ion of this theory.</NOTE>, the former probably being the original, the latter the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e under a peculiar, and at pre&s;ent an inexplicable modification.</P>
<P>One experiment tending to elucidate the point under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I had my&s;elf an opportunity of in&s;tituting. On the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being po&s;&s;ible that the Cow which ranges over the fertile meadows in the vale of Glouce&s;ter, might generate a virus differing in &s;ome re&s;pects in its qualities from that produced by the animal artificially pampered for the production of milk for the metropolis, I procured, during my re&s;idence there in the &s;pring, &s;ome Cow Pock virus from a cow at one of the London milk-farms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was taken by Mr. Tanner, then a &s;tudent at the Veterinary College, from a cow at Mr. Clark's farm at Kenti&s;h Town.</NOTE>. It was immediately conveyed into Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire
<PB N="12" REF="10">to Dr. Mar&s;hall, who was then exten&s;ively engaged in the inoculation of the Cow Pox, the general re&s;ult of which, and of the inoculation in particular with this matter, I &s;hall lay before my Readers in the following communication from the Doctor.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My neighbour Mr. Hicks having mentioned your wi&s;h to be informed of the progre&s;s of the inoculation here for the Cow Pox, and he al&s;o having taken the trouble to tran&s;mit to you my minutes of the Ca&s;es which have fallen under my care, I hope you will pardon the further trouble I now give you in &s;tating the ob&s;ervations I have made upon the &s;ubject. When fir&s;t informed of it, having two children who had not had the Small Pox, I determined to inoculate them for the Cow Pox when|ever I &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to procure matter proper for the purpo&s;e. I was therefore particularly happy when I was in|formed that I could procure matter from &s;ome of tho&s;e whom you had inoculated. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I had no intention of extending the di&s;ea&s;e further than my own family, but the
<PB N="13" REF="11">very exten&s;ive influence which the conviction of its efficacy in re&s;i&s;ting the Small Pox has had upon the minds of the people in general, has rendered that intention nugatory, as you will perceive by the continuation of my Ca&s;es enclo&s;ed in this letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Mar&s;hall has detailed the&s;e Ca&s;es with great accuracy, but their publication would now be deemed &s;uperfluous. E. J.</NOTE>, by which it will appear, that &s;ince the 22d of March, I have inoculated an hundred and &s;even per&s;ons; which, con|&s;idering the retired &s;ituation I re&s;ide in, is a very great number. There are al&s;o other con&s;iderations which, be&s;ides that of its influence in re&s;i&s;ting the Small Pox, appear to have had their weight; namely, the peculiar mildne&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, the known &s;afety of it, and its not having in any in&s;tance prevented the patient from following his ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s. In all the Ca&s;es under my care, there have only occurred two or three which required any application owing to ery&s;ipelatous inflam|mation on the arm, and they immediately yielded to it. In the remainder the con&s;titutional illne&s;s has been &s;light but &s;ufficiently marked, and con&s;iderably le&s;s than I ever ob&s;erved in the &s;ame
<PB N="14" REF="12">number inoculated with the Small Pox. In only one or two of the Ca&s;es have any other eruptions appeared than tho&s;e around the &s;pot where the matter was in&s;erted, and tho&s;e near the infected part. Neither does there appear in the Cow Pox to be the lea&s;t exciting cau&s;e to any other di&s;ea&s;e, which in the Small Pox has been frequently ob&s;erved, the con&s;titution remaining in as full health and vigour after the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e as before the infection. Another important con&s;ideration appears to be the impo&s;&s;ibility of the di&s;ea&s;e being communicated except by the actual contact of the matter of the pu&s;tule, and con&s;e|quently the perfect &s;afety of the remaining part of the family, &s;uppo&s;ing only one or two &s;hould wi&s;h to be inoculated at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears evident to me, that the Cow Pox is a plea&s;anter, &s;horter, and infinitely more &s;afe di&s;ea&s;e than the inoculated Small Pox when conducted in the mo&s;t careful and approved manner; neither is the local affection of the inoculated part, or the con&s;titutional illne&s;s near &s;o violent. I &s;peak with confidence on the &s;ubject, having had an oppor|tunity
<PB N="15" REF="13">of ob&s;erving its effects upon a variety of con&s;titutions, from three months old to &s;ixty years; and to which I have paid particular attention. In the Ca&s;es alluded to here, you will ob&s;erve that the removal from the original &s;ource of the matter has made no alteration or change in the nature or appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, and that it may be continued, <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> (I imagine) from one per&s;on to another (if care be ob&s;erved in taking the matter at a proper period) without any nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to the original matter of the cow.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be happy if any endeavours of mine could tend further to elucidate the &s;ubject, and &s;hall be much gratified in &s;ending you any further ob&s;ervations I may be enabled to make.</P>

<HEAD>DR. MARSHALL'S SECOND LETTER.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"Since the date of my former letter, I have continued to inoculate with the Cow Pox virus. Including the ca&s;es before enumerated, the number now amounts to four hundred and twenty-three. It would be tedious and u&s;ele&s;s to detail the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in each individual&mdash;it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that I noticed no deviation in any re&s;pect from the Ca&s;es I formerly adduced. The general appearances of the arm exactly corre&s;ponded with the account given in your fir&s;t publication. When they were di&s;po&s;ed to become trouble&s;ome by ery&s;ipelatous inflammation, an application of equal parts of vinegar and water always an&s;wered the de&s;ired intention. I mu&s;t not omit to inform you that when the di&s;ea&s;e had duly acted upon the con&s;titution, I have frequently u&s;ed the vitriolic acid. A portion of a drop applied with the head of a probe or
<PB N="17" REF="15">any convenient uten&s;il upon the pu&s;tule, &s;uffered to remain about forty &s;econds, and afterwards wa&s;hed off with &s;ponge and water, never failed to &s;top its progre&s;s, and expedite the for|mation of a &s;cab.</P>
<P>"I have already &s;ubjected two hundred and eleven of my patients to the action of variolous matter, <HI>but every one re|&s;i&s;ted it.</HI></P>
<P>"The re&s;ult of my experiments (which were made with every requi&s;ite caution) has fully convinced me that the <HI>true Cow Pox</HI> is a &s;afe and infallible preventive from the Small Pox; that in no ca&s;e which has fallen under my ob&s;ervation has it been in any con&s;iderable degree trouble&s;ome, much le&s;s have I &s;een any thing like danger; for in no in&s;tance were the patients prevented from following their ordinary employments.</P>
<P>"In Dr. Woodville's publication on the Cow Pox, I notice an extraordinary fact. He &s;ays that the generality of his patients had pu&s;tules. It certainly appears extremely extraordinary that
<PB N="18" REF="16">in all my Ca&s;es there never was but one pu&s;tule, which appeared on a patient's elbow on the inoculated arm, and maturated. It appeared exactly like that on the inci&s;ed part.</P>
<P>"The whole of my ob&s;ervations, founded as it appears on an exten&s;ive experience, leads me to the&s;e obvious conclu&s;ions; that tho&s;e Ca&s;es which have been or may be adduced again&s;t the preventive powers of the Cow Pox, could not have been tho&s;e of the true kind, &s;ince it mu&s;t appear to be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould have &s;ucceeded in &s;uch a number of Ca&s;es without a &s;ingle exception, if &s;uch a preventive power did not exi&s;t. I cannot entertain a doubt that the inoculated Cow Pox mu&s;t quickly &s;upercede that of Small Pox. If the many important advantages which mu&s;t re&s;ult from the new practice are duly con&s;idered, we may rea&s;onably infer that public benefit, the &s;ure te&s;t of the real merit of di&s;coveries, will render it generally exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>"To you, Sir, as the di&s;coverer of this highly beneficial practice, mankind are under the highe&s;t obligations. As a
<PB N="19" REF="17">private individual I participate in the general feeling; more particularly as you have afforded me an opportunity of noticing the effects of a &s;ingular di&s;ea&s;e, and of viewing the progre&s;s of the mo&s;t curious experiment that ever was recorded in the Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;iology.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>"P. S. I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that of the patients I ino|culated and enumerated in my letter, one hundred and twenty-&s;even were infected with the matter you &s;ent me from the London cow. I di&s;covered no di&s;&s;imilarity of &s;ymptoms in the&s;e ca&s;es, from tho&s;e which I inoculated from matter procured in this country. No pu&s;tules have occurred, except in one or two ca&s;es, where a &s;ingle one appeared on the inoculated arm. No difference was apparent in the local inflammation. There was no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ordinary employment among the labouring people, nor was any medicine required.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<P>I have frequently inoculated one or two in a family, and the remaining part of it &s;ome weeks afterwards. The unin|fected have &s;lept with the infected during the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e without being affected; &s;o that I am fully convinced that the di&s;ea&s;e cannot be taken but by actual contact with the matter.</P>
<P>A curious fact has lately fallen under my ob&s;ervation, on which I leave you to comment.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited a patient with the confluent Small Pox, and charged a lancet with &s;ome of the matter. Two days afterwards I was de&s;ired to inoculate a woman and four children with the Cow Pox, and I inadvertently took the vaccine matter on the &s;ame lancet which was before charged with that of Small Pox. In three days I di&s;covered the mi&s;take, and fully expected that my five patients would be infected with Small Pox; but I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find the di&s;ea&s;e to be the genuine Cow Pox, which proceeded without deviating in any particular from
<PB N="21" REF="19">my former ca&s;es. I afterwards inoculated the&s;e patients with variolous matter, but all of them re&s;i&s;ted its action.</P>
<P>I omitted mentioning another great advantage that now occurs to me in the inoculated Cow Pox; I mean the &s;afety with which pregnant women may have the di&s;ea&s;e communicated to them. I have inoculated a great number of females in that &s;ituation, and never ob&s;erved their ca&s;es to differ in any re&s;pect from tho&s;e of my other patients. Indeed the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o mild, that it &s;eems as if it might at all times be communicated with the mo&s;t perfect &s;afety."</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I &s;hall here take the opportunity of thanking Dr. Mar&s;hall and tho&s;e other gentlemen who have obligingly pre&s;ented me with the re&s;ult of their inoculations; but, as they all agree in the &s;ame point as that given in the above communication, namely, the &s;ecurity of the patient from the effects of the Small Pox after the Cow Pox, their peru&s;al, I pre&s;ume, would afford us &s;atisfaction that has not been amply given already. Particular occurrences I &s;hall of cour&s;e detail. Some of my corre&s;|pondents
<PB N="22" REF="20">have mentioned the appearance of Small Pox-like eruptions at the commencement of their inoculations; but in the&s;e ca&s;es the matter was derived from the original &s;tock at the Small Pox Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf inoculated a very con&s;iderable number from the matter produced by Dr. Mar&s;hall's patients, originating in the London cow, without ob&s;erving pu&s;tules of any kind, and have di&s;per&s;ed it among others who have u&s;ed it with a &s;imilar effect. From this &s;ource Mr. H. Jenner informs me, he has inoculated above an hundred patients without ob&s;erving eruptions. Whether the nature of the virus will undergo any change from being farther removed from its original &s;ource in pa&s;&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively from one per&s;on to another, time alone can determine. That which I am now employing has been in u&s;e near eight months, and not the lea&s;t change is perceptible in its mode of action either locally or con&s;titutionally. There is therefore every rea&s;on to expect that its effects will remain unaltered, and that we &s;hall not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking fre&s;h &s;upplies from the cow.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<P>The following ob&s;ervations were obligingly &s;ent me by Mr. Tierny, A&s;&s;i&s;tant Surgeon to the South Glouce&s;ter Regiment of Militia, to whom I am indebted for a former report on this &s;ubject.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"I inoculated with the Cow Pox matter from the 11th to the latter part of April, twenty-five per&s;ons, including women and children. Some on the 11th were inoculated with the matter Mr. Shrapnell (Surgeon to the Regiment) had from you, the others with matter taken from the&s;e. The progre&s;s of the puncture was accurately ob&s;erved, and its appearance &s;eemed to differ from the Small Pox in having le&s;s inflammation around its ba&s;is on the fir&s;t days, that is, from the third to the &s;eventh; but after this the inflammation increa&s;ed, extending on the tenth or eleventh day to a circle of an inch and a half from its centre, and threatening very &s;ore arms; but this I am happy to &s;ay was not the ca&s;e; for, by applying mercurial ointment to the in|flamed part, which was repeated daily until the inflammation went off, the arm got well without any further application or
<PB N="24" REF="22">trouble. The con&s;titutional &s;ymptoms which appeared on the eighth or ninth day after inoculation, &s;carcely de&s;erved the name of di&s;ea&s;e, as they were &s;o &s;light as to be &s;carcely per|ceptible, except that I could connect a &s;light head-ache and langour, with a &s;tiffne&s;s and rather painful &s;en&s;ation in the axilla. This latter &s;ymptom was the mo&s;t &s;triking, it re|mained from twelve to forty-eight hours. In no ca&s;e did I ob&s;erve the &s;malle&s;t pu&s;tule, or even di&s;colouration of the &s;kin like an incipient pu&s;tule, except about the part where the virus had been applied.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e &s;ymptoms had &s;ub&s;ided, and the arms were well, I inoculated four of this number with variolous matter, taken from a patient in another regiment. In each of the&s;e it was in&s;erted &s;everal times under the cuticle, producing &s;light inflammation on the &s;econd or third day, and always di&s;appear|ing before the fifth or &s;ixth; except in one who had the Cow Pox in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire before he joined us, and who al&s;o received it at this time by inoculation. In this man the puncture
<PB N="25" REF="23">inflamed, and his arm was much &s;orer than from the in&s;ertion of the Cow Pox virus; but there was no pain in the axilla, nor could any con&s;titutional affection be ob&s;erved.</P>

<P>Although the &s;u&s;ceptibility of the virus of the Cow Pox is for the mo&s;t part lo&s;t in tho&s;e who have had the Small Pox, yet in &s;ome con&s;titutions it is only partially de&s;troyed, and in others it does not appear to be in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>By far the greater number, on whom trials were made, re|&s;i&s;ted it entirely; yet I found &s;ome on who&s;e arms the pu&s;tule from inoculation was formed completely, but without producing
<PB N="26" REF="24">the common efflore&s;cent blu&s;h around it, or any con&s;titutional illne&s;s, while others have had the di&s;ea&s;e in the mo&s;t perfect manner. A ca&s;e of the latter kind having been pre&s;ented to me by Mr. Few&s;ter, Surgeon, of Thornbury, I &s;hall infert it.</P>

<P>"Three children were inoculated with the vaccine matter you obligingly &s;ent me. On calling to look at their arms three days after, I was told that John Hodges, one of the three, had been inoculated with the Small Pox when a year old, and that he had a full burthen, of which his face produced plentiful marks, a circum&s;tance I was not before made acquainted with. On the &s;ixth day the arm of this boy appeared as if inoculated with variolous matter, but the pu&s;tule was rather more elevated. On the ninth day he complained of violent pain in his head and back, accompanied with vomiting and much fever. The next day he was very well, and went to work as u&s;ual. The punc|tured part began to &s;pread, and there was the areola around the inoculated part to a con&s;iderable extent.</P>

<P>It appears then that the animal economy with regard to the action of this virus is under the &s;ame laws as it is with re&s;pect to the variolous virus, after previou&s;ly feeling its influence, as far as compari&s;ons can be made between the two di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Some &s;triking in&s;tances of the power of the Cow Pox in &s;u&s;pending the progre&s;s of the Small Pox after the patients had been &s;everal days ca&s;ually expo&s;ed to the infection have been laid before me, by Mr. Lyford, Surgeon, of Winche&s;ter, and my nephew the Rev. G. C. Jenner. Mr. Lyford, after giving an account of his exten&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful practice in the vaccine inoculation in Hamp&s;hire, writes as follows:</P>
<Q>"The following Ca&s;e occurred to me a &s;hort time &s;ince, and
<PB N="28" REF="26">may probably be worth your notice. I was &s;ent for to a patient with the Small Pox, and on inquiry found that five days previous to my &s;eeing him the eruption began to appear. During the whole of this time two children, who had not had the Small Pox, were con&s;tantly in the room with their father, and frequently on the bed with him. The mother con&s;ulted me on the propriety of inoculating them, but objected to my taking the matter from their father, as he was &s;ubject to ery&s;i|pelas. I advi&s;ed her by all means to have them inoculated at that time, as I could not procure any variolous matter el&s;ewhere. However, they were inoculated with vaccine matter, but I cannot &s;ay I flattered my&s;elf with its proving &s;ucce&s;sful, as they had previou&s;ly been &s;o long and &s;till continued to be expo&s;ed to the variolous infection. Notwith&s;tanding this I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e advance and go through its regular cour&s;e; and, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to the total extinction of the Small Pox."</Q>
<P>Mr. Jenner's Ca&s;es were not le&s;s &s;atisfactory. He writes as follows:</P>
<PB N="29" REF="27">
<Q><P>"A &s;on of Thomas Stinchcomb of Woodford, near Berkeley, was infected with the natural Small Pox at Bri&s;tol, and came home to his father's cottage. Four days after the eruptions had appeared upon the boy, the family (none of which had ever had the Small Pox) con&s;i&s;ting of the father, mother, and five children, was inoculated with vaccine virus. On the arm of the mother it failed to produce the lea&s;t effect, and &s;he of cour&s;e had the Small Pox<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under &s;imilar circum&s;tances I think it would be advi&s;eable to in&s;ert the matter into each arm, which would be more likely to in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of the operation.</NOTE>, but the re&s;t of the family had the Cow Pox in the u&s;ual mild way, and were not affected with the Small Pox, although they were in the &s;ame room, and the children &s;lept in the &s;ame bed with their brother who was confined to it with the natural Small Pox; and &s;ub&s;equently with their mother.</P>
<P>I attended this family with my brother Mr. H. Jenner."</P></Q>
<P>The following Ca&s;es are of too &s;ingular a nature to remain unnoticed.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="28">
<P>Mi&s;s R&mdash;, a young lady about five years old, was &s;eized on the evening of the eighth day after inoculation with vaccine virus, with &s;uch &s;ymptoms as commonly denote the acce&s;&s;ion of violent fever. Her throat was al&s;o a little &s;ore, and there were &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations about the mu&s;cles of the neck. The day following a ra&s;h was perceptible on her face and neck, &s;o much re&s;embling the efflore&s;cence of the <HI>Scarlatina Angi|no&s;a,</HI> that I was induced to a&s;k whether Mi&s;s R&mdash; had been expo&s;ed to the contagion of that di&s;ea&s;e. An an&s;wer in the affirmative, and the rapid &s;preading of the redne&s;s over the &s;kin, at once relieved me from much anxiety re&s;pecting the nature of the malady, which went through its cour&s;e in the ordinary way, but not without &s;ymptoms which were alarming, both to my&s;elf and Mr. Lyford, who attended with me. There was no apparent deviation in the ordinary progre&s;s of the pu&s;tule to a &s;tate of maturity, from what we &s;ee in general; yet there was a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Arcola</HI> or florid di&s;colouration around it, until the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> had retired from the con|&s;titution.
<PB N="31" REF="29">As &s;oon as the patient was freed from this di&s;ea&s;e, this appearance advanced in the u&s;ual way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I witne&s;&s;ed a &s;imilar fact in a ca&s;e of Mea&s;les<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 55.</NOTE>. The pu&s;tule from the Cow Pock virus advanced to maturity, while the Mea&s;les exi&s;ted in the con&s;titution, but no <HI>efflore&s;cence</HI> appeared around it until the Mea&s;les had cea&s;ed to exert its influence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of Mi&s;s H&mdash; R&mdash; is not le&s;s intere&s;ting than that of her &s;i&s;ter above related. She was expo&s;ed to the con|tagion of the <HI>Scarlatina</HI> at the &s;ame time, and &s;ickened almo&s;t at the &s;ame hour. The &s;ymptoms continued &s;evere about twelve hours when the Scarlatine-ra&s;h &s;hewed it&s;elf faintly upon her face, and partly upon her neck. After remaining two or three hours it &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, and &s;he became perfectly free from every complaint. My &s;urpri&s;e at this &s;udden tran&s;ition from extreme &s;ickne&s;s to health, in great mea&s;ure cea&s;ed when I ob&s;erved that the inoculated pu&s;tule had occa&s;ioned, in this ca&s;e, the common efflore&s;cent appearance around it, and that as it approached the centre it was nearly in an ery&s;ipelatous
<PB N="32" REF="30">&s;tate. But the mo&s;t remarkable part of this hi&s;tory is, that on the fourth day afterwards, as &s;oon as the efflore&s;cence began to die away upon the arm, and the pu&s;tule to dry up, the <HI>Scar|latina</HI> again appeared, her throat became &s;ore, the ra&s;h &s;pread all over her. She went fairly through the di&s;ea&s;e, with its common &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>That the&s;e were actually Ca&s;es of <HI>Scarlatina,</HI> was rendered certain by two &s;ervants in the family falling ill at the &s;ame time with the di&s;temper, who had been expo&s;ed to the infection with the young ladies.</P>
<P>Some there are who &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ecurity from the Small Pox obtained through the Cow Pox will be of a temporary nature only. This &s;uppo&s;ition is refuted not only by analogy with re&s;pect to the habits of di&s;ea&s;es of a &s;imilar nature, but by in|controvertible facts, which appear in great numbers again&s;t it. To tho&s;e already adduced in the former part of my fir&s;t Treati&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, &amp;c.</NOTE>
<PB N="33" REF="31">many more might be added were it deemed nece&s;&s;ary; but among the Ca&s;es I refer to, one will be found of a per&s;on who had the Cow Pox fifty-three years before the effect of the Small Pox was tried upon him. As he completely re&s;i&s;ted it, the intervening period I conceive mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;atisfy any rea&s;on|able mind. Should further evidence be thought nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall ob&s;erve that among the Ca&s;es pre&s;ented to me by Mr. Fry, Mr. Darke, Mr. Tierny, Mr. H. Jenner, and others, there were many whom they inoculated ineffectually with variolous matter, who had gone through the Cow Pox many years before this trial was made.</P>
<P>It has been imagined that the Cow Pox is capable of being communicated from one per&s;on to another by effluvia without the intervention of inoculation. My experiments, made with the de&s;ign of a&s;certaining this important point, all tend to e&s;tabli&s;h my original po&s;ition, that it is not in&s;ectious, except by contact. I have never he&s;itated to &s;uffer tho&s;e on who&s;e arms there were pu&s;tules exhaling the effluvia, from a&s;&s;ociating or even &s;leeping with others who never had experienced either the Cow
<PB N="34" REF="32">Pox or the Small Pox. And further, I have repeatedly among children cau&s;ed the uninfected to breathe over the inoculated vaccine pu&s;tules during their whole progre&s;s, yet the&s;e experi|ments were tried without the lea&s;t effect. However, to &s;ubmit a matter &s;o important to a &s;till further &s;crutiny, I de&s;ired Mr. H. Jenner to make any further experiments which might &s;trike him as mo&s;t likely to e&s;tabli&s;h or refute what had been advanced on this &s;ubject. He has &s;ince informed me, "that he inoculated children at the brea&s;t, who&s;e mothers had not gone through either the Small Pox or the Cow Pox; that he had inoculated mothers who&s;e &s;ucking infants had never undergone either of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; that the effluvia from the inoculated pu&s;tules, in either ca&s;e, had been inhaled from day to day during the whole progre&s;s of their maturation, and that there was not the lea&s;t perceptible effect from the&s;e expo&s;ures. One woman he inoculated about a week previous to her <HI>Accouchment,</HI> that her infant might be the more fully and conveniently expo&s;ed to the pu&s;tule; but, as in the former in&s;tances, no infection was given, although the child frequently &s;lept on the arm of its mother with its no&s;trils and mouth expo&s;ed to the pu&s;tule in the
<PB N="35" REF="33">fulle&s;t &s;tate of maturity. In a word, is it not impo&s;&s;ible for the Cow Pox, who&s;e <HI>only</HI> manife&s;tation appears to con&s;i&s;t in the pu&s;tules <HI>created by contact,</HI> to produce <HI>it&s;elf</HI> by effluvia?</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a late inoculation, I ob&s;erved an appearance which it may be proper here to relate. The punctured part on a boy's arm (who was inoculated with fre&s;h limpid virus) on the &s;ixth day, in&s;tead of &s;hewing a beginning ve&s;icle, which is u&s;ual in the Cow Pox at that period, was en|cru&s;ted over with a rugged amber-coloured &s;cab. The &s;cab continued to &s;pread and increa&s;e in thickne&s;s for &s;ome days, when at its edges a ve&s;icated ring appeared, and the di&s;ea&s;e went through its ordinary cour&s;e, the boy having had &s;orene&s;s in the axilla, and &s;ome &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition. With the fluid matter taken from his arm, five per&s;ons were inoculated. In one it took no effect. In another it produced a perfect pu&s;tule without any deviation from the common appearance; but in the other three the progre&s;s of the inflammation was exactly &s;imilar to the in&s;tance which afforded the virus for their inoculation; there was a creeping &s;cab of a loo&s;e texture, and &s;ub&s;equently the
<PB N="36" REF="34">formation of limpid fluid at its edges. As the&s;e people were all em|ployed in laborious exerci&s;es, it is po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e anomalous appearances might owe their origin to the friction of the clothes on the newly-inflamed part of the arm. I have not yet had an opportunity of expo&s;ing them to the Small Pox.</P>
<P>In the early part of this Inquiry I felt far more anxious re|&s;pecting the inflammation of the inoculated arm than at pre&s;ent; yet that this affection will go on to a greater extent than could be wi&s;hed is a circum&s;tance &s;ometimes to be expected. As this can be checked, or even entirely &s;ubdued by very &s;imple means, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the patient &s;hould feel an unea&s;y hour becau&s;e an application may not be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. About the tenth or eleventh day, if the pu&s;tule has proceeded regularly, the appearance of the arm will almo&s;t to a certainty indicate whether this is to be expected or not. Should it happen, nothing more need be done than to apply a &s;ingle drop of the <HI>Aqua Lythargyr. Acctati</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract of Saturn.</NOTE> upon the pu&s;tule, and having &s;uffer|ed it to remain two or three minutes, to cover the efflore&s;cence
<PB N="37" REF="35">&s;urrounding the pu&s;tule with a piece of linen dipped in the <HI>Aqua Lythargyr. Compos.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goulard Water. For further information on this &s;ubject &s;ee the fir&s;t Treati&s;e on the Var. Vac. Dr. Mar&s;hall's Letters, &amp;c.</NOTE> The former may be repeated twice or thrice during the day, the latter as often as it may feel agreeable to the patient.</P>
<P>When the &s;cab is prematurely rubbed off, (a circum&s;tance not unfrequent among children and working people) the ap|plication of a little <HI>Aqua Lythargyri Acct.</HI> to the part, immedi|ately coagulates the &s;urface, which &s;upplies its place, and prevents a &s;ore.</P>
<P>In my former Treati&s;es on this &s;ubject I have remarked that the human con&s;titution frequently retains its &s;u&s;ceptibility of the Small Pox contagion (both from effluvia and contact) after previou&s;ly feeling its influence. In further corroboration of this declaration, many facts have been communicated to me by various corre&s;pondents. I &s;hall &s;elect one of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Society at large mu&s;t I think feel much indebted to you for your Inquiries and Ob&s;ervations on the Nature and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, &amp;c. &amp;c. As I conceive what I am now about to communicate to be of &s;ome importance, I imagine it cannot be unintere&s;ting to you, e&s;pecially as it will &s;erve to corroborate your a&s;&s;ertion of the &s;u&s;ceptibility of the human &s;y&s;tem of the variolous contagion, although it has previou&s;ly been made &s;en&s;ible of its action. In November 1793, I was de&s;ired to inoculate a per&s;on with the Small Pox. I took the variolous matter from a child under the di&s;ea&s;e in the natural way, who had a large burthen of di&s;tinct pu&s;tules. The mother of the child being de&s;irous of &s;eeing my method of communi|cating the di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation, after having opened a pu&s;tule, I introduced the point of my lancet in the u&s;ual way on the back part of my own hand, and thought no more of it until I felt a &s;en&s;ation in the part, which reminded me of the tran&s;ac|tion. This happened upon the third day; on the fourth there were all the appearances common to inoculation, at which I was
<PB N="39" REF="37">not at all &s;urpri&s;ed, nor did I feel my&s;elf unea&s;y upon per|ceiving the inflammation continue to increa&s;e to the &s;ixth and &s;eventh day, accompanied with a very &s;mall quantity of fluid, repeated experiments having taught me it might happen &s;o with per&s;ons who had undergone the di&s;ea&s;e, and yet would e&s;cape any con&s;titutional affection: but I was not &s;o fortunate; for on the eighth day I was &s;eized with all the &s;ymptoms of the eruptive fever, but in a much more violent degree than when I was before inoculated, which was about eighteen years previous to this, when I had a con&s;iderable number of pu&s;tules. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was now greatly alarmed, although I had been much engaged in the Small Pox, having at different times inoculated not le&s;s than two thou&s;and per&s;ons. I was convinced my pre&s;ent indi&s;po&s;i|tion proceeded from the in&s;ertion of the variolous matter, and therefore anxiou&s;ly looked for an eruption. On the tenth day I felt a very unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of &s;tiffne&s;s, and heat on each &s;ide of my face near my ear, and the fever began to decline. The affection in my face &s;oon terminated in three or four
<PB N="40" REF="38">pu&s;tules attended with inflammation, but which did not ma|turate, and I was pre&s;ently well.</P>

<P>This Inquiry is not now &s;o much in its infancy as to re&s;train me from &s;peaking more po&s;itively than formerly on the im|portant point of Scrophula as connected with the Small Pox.</P>
<P>Every practitioner in medicine, who has exten&s;ively inocu|lated with the Small Pox, or has attended many of tho&s;e who have had the di&s;temper in the natural way, mu&s;t acknowledge that he has frequently &s;een &s;crophulous affections, in &s;ome form or another, &s;ometimes rather quickly &s;hewing them&s;elves after the recovery of the patients. Conceiving this fact to be ad|mitted, as I pre&s;ume it mu&s;t be by all who have carefully attend|ed to the &s;ubject, may I not a&s;k whether it does not appear
<PB N="41" REF="39">probable that the general introduction of the Small Pox into Europe has not been among the mo&s;t conducive means in ex|citing that formidable foe to health? Having attentively watched the effects of the Cow Pox in this re&s;pect, I am happy in being able to declare, that the di&s;ea&s;e does not appear to have the lea&s;t tendency to produce this de&s;tructive malady.</P>
<P>The &s;ceptici&s;m that appeared even among the mo&s;t enlightened of medical men when my &s;entiments on the important &s;ubject of the Cow Pox were fir&s;t promulgated, was highly laudable. To have admitted the truth of a doctrine, at once &s;o novel and &s;o unlike any thing that ever had appeared in the Annals of Medicine, without the te&s;t of the mo&s;t rigid &s;crutiny, would have bordered upon temerity; but now, when that &s;crutiny has taken place, not only among our&s;elves but in the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ional circles in Europe, and when it has been uniformly found in &s;uch abundant in&s;tances that the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of the genuine Cow Pox in the way that has been de&s;cribed, is never afterwards at any period of its exi&s;tence a&s;&s;ailable by the Small Pox, may I not with perfect confidence
<PB N="42" REF="40">congratulate my country and &s;ociety at large on their beholding, in the mild form of the Cow Pox, an antidote that is capable of extirpating from the earth a di&s;ea&s;e which is every hour de|vouring its victims; a di&s;ea&s;e that has ever been con&s;idered as the &s;evere&s;t &s;courge of the human race!</P>
