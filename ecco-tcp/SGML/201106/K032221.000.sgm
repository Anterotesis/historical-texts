<P>PERMIT me to dedicate to you, and to pre|&s;ent for your Acceptance, the following little Treati&s;e on the Hooping Cough. I regret that both in its Compo&s;ition and its intrin&s;ic Merit it is &s;o little worthy of your Attention, and &s;o little capable of affording either Amu&s;ement or Information. You will readily perceive that it is the Work of a young, and perhaps of an inexperienced Man, but you will al&s;o acknow|ledge, that the intere&s;ting Nature of the Sub|ject, and its being a fir&s;t Performance, entitle it to a candid and liberal Allowance. As a Member of the Lyceum Medicum Londi|nen&s;e, I feel my&s;elf intere&s;ted in its Welfare and Pro&s;perity, and as a medical Practitioner, I am anxious to contribute my feeble Efforts towards the Advancement and Promotion of
<PB N="vi" REF="4">&s;o valuable a Science. I have to lament that my pre&s;ent Embarra&s;&s;ments and the &s;urrounding Situation of Affairs, have for a while diverted my Attention towards tho&s;e Subjects, which though not le&s;s u&s;eful are generally con&s;idered as improper to be pur&s;ued by tho&s;e who are educated in the medical Profe&s;&s;ion. How far the Ob&s;ervation may be ju&s;t, or the Cen&s;ure merited, can be decided only, by an Inve&s;ti|gation of pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, and an impartial Enquiry into the Probability of future Events. I can only add, that &s;hould the pre|&s;ent little Trifle be &s;o fortunate as to experi|ence a favourable Reception; I tru&s;t it will be received but as an Earne&s;t of future Exertions, and that I &s;hall be readily believed when I a&s;|&s;ert, that my mo&s;t &s;incere and anxious De&s;ire is to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Labours and tho&s;e Studies which are found from Experience to be the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful and beneficial to all Mankind.</P>

<P>THE following little E&s;&s;ay was fir&s;t writ|ten &s;omewhat more than a Twelvemonth ago, and read as a Paper at the Lyceum Medi|cum Londinen&s;e.

Its having occupied the Attention of the Society for twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Weeks, during which, it underwent a long and critical Examination, although it afford no demon&s;trative Proof of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any Share of Merit, will furni&s;h at lea&s;t, an Apology for its Publication.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE TUSSIS CONVULSIVA.</HEAD>
<P>BEING called upon by this Society rather &s;ooner than I expected, to furni&s;h a paper for their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and anxious to comply with their requi&s;ition, although not &s;ufficiently pre|pared, I have endeavoured to bring forward to their notice, a Treati&s;e on the Tu&s;&s;is Convul&s;iva; or, as it is more frequently denominated, the Hooping Cough: and this, not with a view, pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly to advance any po&s;itive or decided Opinion, but from a &s;incere de&s;ire to excite the attention, and provoke the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, who&s;e abilities and experience, while they entitle them to &s;uperior re&s;pect, afford them al&s;o, the means of &s;uperior information!</P>
<P>The Tu&s;&s;is Convul&s;iva, is a di&s;ea&s;e, which, al|though well known, has been &s;eldom de&s;cribed; few authors having given us any regular de&s;cription
<PB N="10" REF="8">of it, or, till lately, recommended any peculiar plan of treatment: nor do they &s;eem to have di&s;|criminated it from any other cough, excepting only by that di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ymptom, which has given it the name of Hooping Cough. Specifics, in|deed, have been propo&s;ed, and cicuta, by &s;ome practitioners, hath been highly extolled: Opium, al&s;o, has been e&s;teemed of &s;uperior efficacy, and Emetics have been almo&s;t univer&s;ally employed.</P>
<P>As the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of my introducing this &s;ubject to the Society, was to combat &s;ome pre|vailing opinions, and to endeavour to controvert &s;ome peculiar prejudices, which I conceive to have been adopted; it will unavoidably happen, that I may &s;eem to deliver my &s;entiments too freely, and to be guilty of great temerity in ven|turing to oppo&s;e the &s;olitary te&s;timony of the youth|ful practitioner, to the re&s;pectable authority of the experienced Phy&s;ician!</P>
<P>But it will, I hope, be remembered, that altho' a ju&s;t deference &s;hould certainly be paid to the re&s;earches of Antiquity, and to the ob&s;ervations of Experience; yet it is, &s;urely, a very dangerous experiment, to de&s;i&s;t from enquiry, and grow weary of inve&s;tigation: the di&s;covery of truth has &s;eldom or never been completely effected by
<PB N="11" REF="9">the labours of one, but by the collective and united indu&s;try of many: what, therefore, has e&s;caped the wi&s;dom of the former, may happily have been granted to the per&s;everance of the latter; and of the republic of letters, at lea&s;t, it may be &s;aid, that the only <HI>Road</HI> to improvement, is through the <HI>Path</HI> of <HI>Innovation!</HI></P>
<P>If, however, in what I have to offer, I &s;hould &s;eem e&s;&s;entially to differ in opinion and practice from the majority of this Society, I entreat them to acquit me of any imputation of ob&s;tinate pre|&s;umption, or affected &s;ingularity; and I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure them that it is from a full conviction of the truth of what I &s;hall a&s;&s;ert, and from a &s;en&s;e of the duty I owe to this Society in particular, as a member, and to the public in general as a medical practitioner, that I bring forward to their notice the con&s;ideration of a di&s;ea&s;e, frequent in occur|rence, always hazardous, and often fatal: in the progre&s;s of which, con&s;cious of the Inaccuracies and &s;en&s;ible of the Defects, but too vi&s;ible in this compo&s;ition; I feel it nece&s;&s;ary, while I &s;olicit their attention, to claim al&s;o, their u&s;ual Indul|gence.</P>
<P>I was, in&s;en&s;ibly, led to this digre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e, upon mature deliberation, I cannot but entertain
<PB N="12" REF="10">very different notions of the nature and properties of the Cau&s;e and Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and have been induced, con&s;equently, to adopt a very different treatment. I &s;hall endeavour to give the Society, as far as I am enabled, my opinion of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, &s;hew what are its u&s;ual cau&s;es and effects, and by relating to them &s;ome remarkable Ca&s;es, demon&s;tratively prove, what plan of treatment I have found to be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The Tu&s;&s;is Convul&s;iva is that di&s;ea&s;e, which, together with the &s;ymptoms, u&s;ually attendant upon pulmonary affections, is accompanied with a Contagion of a peculiar and malignant nature; hence it has al&s;o obtained the name of Tu&s;&s;is Feri|na. I &s;hall not he&s;itate here, to define it to be, a di&s;ea&s;e of clear and evident debility; and one which never takes place, but in tho&s;e who have either been previou&s;ly weakened by &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, or who from &s;ome unknown or unfore&s;een cau&s;e are predi&s;po&s;ed to this &s;tate.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons mo&s;t liable to it are tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s a weak, lax fibre; who u&s;e little exerci&s;e; and in fine, tho&s;e who, from whatever cau&s;e, have a deficient per&s;piration. Hence Children from 4 months to 12 years, are in a remarkable manner affected by it: and indeed, I have &s;een
<PB N="13" REF="11">but one in&s;tance of its taking place in any one of riper years; and this was in a young Lady of a very delicate habit, who might be about nineteen years of age.</P>
<P>Its primary cau&s;e is contagion, which, whether it be <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> or of the &s;ame nature with that, whereby all infectious di&s;ea&s;es are produced, and which, differing only in modification, or degree, occa&s;ions &s;ometimes Small Pox, or Mea&s;les, &s;ometimes Typhus, or Hooping Cough, is at pre|&s;ent &s;ugge&s;ted, I confe&s;s, as conjecture only; yet perhaps not unrea&s;onably, &s;ince in a family where the Mea&s;les have prevailed, the Hooping Cough has frequently followed; and in the &s;ame child, I have experienced both di&s;ea&s;es to be at one and the &s;ame time pre&s;ent, cau&s;ing however no e&s;&s;ential difference in the treatment.</P>
<P>The proximate cau&s;es will be found to be all &s;uch as tend to induce debility: hence at a moi&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and in a damp &s;ituation, it is found to rage with the utmo&s;t violence: frequently indeed, no other cau&s;e than this can be traced, as I lately expe|rienced in attending three children, who&s;e parents had ju&s;t removed to a new and damp habitation: together with this, a relaxed habit, where the pores being more patulous, are mo&s;t liable to the
<PB N="14" REF="12">impre&s;&s;ion of Contagion, Pulmonary Affections in general, and in fine, any cau&s;e capable of inducing a languid &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Its immediate &s;eat is in the exhalant and mucous arteries: the &s;ecreted Fluids of which, being in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated by &s;tagnation in the Bronchia, form the matter of Expectoration. In this, as in any other Cough, it is the &s;erous and mucous Fluids, that chiefly flow to the Bronchia, which continue to bear their pre&s;&s;ure for a while, till di&s;tended by the load, they can bear it no longer: the unplea|&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of the &s;timulus, excites a commotion in the vitality of the labouring part, and rouzes the whole excitement; a Cough ari&s;es and throws off its cau&s;e, the collected humours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">El. Med.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At this time, and during a fit of Coughing, the air is violently expelled; and as an animal cannot exi&s;t, for any con&s;iderable interval without the admi&s;&s;ion of air, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, it in&s;tinctively makes an effort of in&s;piration; when the air &s;uddenly ru&s;hing as it were into a vacuum, cau&s;es that remarkable found, which from its &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;emblance to the articulation of the word Hoop, has given it the name of Hooping Cough.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>Hence it is ea&s;y to account for the effects pro|duced by this di&s;ea&s;e. They are indeed, of a very formidable nature, and are frequently of a mo&s;t alarming and fatal tendency: &s;ometimes after a violent fit of Coughing, the Patient is &s;eized with convul&s;ions and in&s;tantly expires. This may hap|pen from two cau&s;es; fir&s;t from the continued action of the Lungs urged by the Irritation of the Cough, preventing In&s;piration, and thus inducing &s;trangulation; or &s;econdly, from the lungs, being unable to recover their tone, yielding to the im|pul&s;e of the external atmo&s;phere, and being over|whelmed by its &s;udden intromi&s;&s;ion. An in&s;tance of which I knew in a beautiful Child of about three years of age who&s;e Mother had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of her child's being in any danger. Sometimes, on account of the continued ob&s;truction of the circulation, the lungs being violently di&s;tend|ed, yield to the impetus of the &s;hock, a Blood Ve&s;&s;el bur&s;ts, and the patient is cut off. If, however, the patient have the good fortune to e&s;cape the&s;e dangers, the di&s;ea&s;e by gaining ground, and the cough returning more frequently, continue to weary and exhau&s;t, till he gradually &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>In tracing the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this di&s;|ea&s;e, it will not, I hope, be deemed foreign to the &s;ubject, to &s;ay a few words re&s;pecting conta|gion, more e&s;picially, as I think it will tend to
<PB N="16" REF="14">illu&s;trate what I have hitherto con&s;tantly kept in view, viz. the being guided in the treatment of a di&s;ea&s;e, more by the general &s;tate of the patient than by any particular &s;ymptom or &s;et of &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P>Contagion is a certain &s;ubtle, imperceptible matter, of an unknown nature, re&s;embling mo&s;t natural phenomena, which are only in any mea&s;ure open to our enquiry by their evident effects. Taken from the body of one affected with it, or from gro&s;s &s;ub&s;tance (&s;uch as cloathes, or furniture, where it happens to have been lurk|ing) and received into a healthy body; it ferments without any change of the &s;olids or fluids, fills all the ve&s;&s;els, and is gradually ejected by the pores; pa&s;&s;ing out more copiou&s;ly or &s;cantily, in propor|tion as the per&s;piration is more free or impeded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">El. Med.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the i&s;&s;ue of the matter is here promoted, by inducing a free per&s;piration, &s;o whatever part of it be ob&s;tructed, and detained below the cuticle, acquires by this delay, a certain acrimony produ|cing little inflammations, and conducting them when produced to &s;uppuration. Upon this princi|ple, are the &s;mall pox, mea&s;les, and other exan|thematous di&s;ea&s;es to be accounted for.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="15">
<P>As contagion however requires a certain time for its tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion; it follows, that the mo&s;t favour|able &s;tate for this purpo&s;e, will be that where the different &s;ecretions are mo&s;t perfectly performed, and where, con&s;equently, the &s;y&s;tem comes the neare&s;t to the healthy &s;tate: for it is very evident from daily experience, that in weakened or vitiated habits, where the functions are ill performed, and where per&s;piration is deficient, it is capable, by its detention, of infecting peculiar fluids, and con|verting them into a matter, &s;imilar to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet as contagion, by its &s;ubtle and peculiar nature, is found to be imbibed by all habits (per|fect health perhaps alone excepted) I am unwilling to allow, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any &s;hare in producing general diathe&s;is; but that it kindles up only a &s;ymptomatic pyrexia, &s;trictly entitled to the ap|pellation of local di&s;ea&s;e, and, by its entrance into a healthy, or unhealthy con&s;titution, produces tho&s;e different effects, which are &s;een to proceed from it.</P>
<P>And this imperceptibly leads me to the con&s;ide|ration of &s;pecifics. A medicine is denominated &s;pe|cific, when it is applied for the cure of any peculiar di&s;ea&s;e, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only
<PB N="18" REF="16">medicine, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of removing or eradicating that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As poi&s;ons applied, or admitted into the &s;y&s;|tem, were found to produce certain mechanical effects, and &s;eemed in &s;ome degree, to act in an uniform manner; the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of curio&s;ity and active ingenuity of mankind, prompted them to re&s;earches after &s;ome antidote which might be peculiarly adapted to it, and prove efficacious in its di&s;per&s;ion: hence Mercury, by proving &s;ucce&s;s|ful in the cure of lues venerea, has been denomi|nated its &s;pecific, and &s;ome Practitioners have not he&s;itated to declare cicuta to be, a certain &s;pecific for the Hooping Cough. Yet I conceive it will readily be granted, that for a medicine to be fairly entitled to the denomination of a &s;pecific, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be uniform in its operation and certain in its &s;ucce&s;s: now be&s;ide the great difficulty of actually proving the exi&s;tence of a &s;pecific in nature, &s;everal ca&s;es are upon record of lues venerea re&s;i&s;ting the mo&s;t vigorous applica|tions of mercury, in all its forms and varieties, and yielding to medicines of a very different nature. With re&s;pect to cicuta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. W&mdash; B&mdash; will, I tru&s;t, excu&s;e me for this ob&s;er|vation; he has long &s;ince pronounced me a confirmed heretic, he cannot, therefore, be &s;urprized at my want of faith.</NOTE> &s;o warmly prai&s;ed by &s;ome
<PB N="19" REF="17">and recommended by others, I mu&s;t frankly con|fe&s;s that it becomes me to &s;peak of it with doubt and he&s;itation, having partly through fear, and partly through incredulity, &s;eldom or never em|ployed it.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e then originating from contagion, will be found like all others of that cla&s;s to produce in its incipient &s;tate no material change or altera|tion. A cough is the fir&s;t &s;ymptom, which differs very little from any common cough or cold. The appetite is not in general impaired; the countenance remains in its u&s;ual &s;tate; nor is it &s;ometimes known, that this di&s;ea&s;e is pre&s;ent, except by a knowledge of its having prevailed at any place, whence it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be imbibed. As it proceeds, however, it becomes more clearly marked; the excretory ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, being crammed with a colluvies of fluids, create a &s;en&s;e of tightne&s;s in the &s;ternum, and great difficulty of breathing; the &s;tomach begins to reject its contents, and together with the&s;e, great quantities of vi&s;cid phlegm are either vomited or coughed up. The countenance grows pale, alternate heats and chills with other hectic &s;ymptoms take place, and the &s;ound re&s;embling the word hoop is now di&s;tinctly ob&s;erved.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="18">
<P>In the la&s;t &s;tage, the &s;ymptoms become more urgent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: putrid &s;ymptoms, the u&s;ual con&s;equence of contagion, manife&s;tly appear; foul breath, crude dark coloured feces or violent diarrhoea; &s;pa&s;modic twitches of the tendons, but particularly a convul&s;ive motion of the no&s;trils; great anxiety, with high and laborious re&s;piration, all but too clearly foretel the approach of death; and every day's experience brings with it &s;ome &s;ad monument of the tyranny of this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To apply a &s;uitable remedy in the treatment of a di&s;ea&s;e, nothing more &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary than to po&s;&s;e&s;s a competent knowledge of its cau&s;e: &s;ince if the cau&s;e be exactly a&s;certained, the effects re&s;ulting from it will be better under&s;tood: and as identity of known cau&s;e always produces identity of known effect, if the cau&s;e be uniform, the effect will be uniform al&s;o.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, however, in treating the di&s;ea&s;es incident to humanity, we are too apt to lo&s;e &s;ight of this general and fundamental principle, and depart from the guidance of rea&s;on: confiding in hidden powers, which have no exi&s;tence, and relying on miracles which cannot take place, we &s;ometimes expect from a random and contradictory treatment, the mo&s;t complete and unequivocal &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="19">
<P>Hence while Hooping Cough has been generally admitted to be a di&s;ea&s;e of debility, the practice of vomiting has been warmly recommended and followed; and the evacuation of an already exhau&s;t|ed &s;y&s;tem has been, by &s;ome, e&s;teemed the mo&s;t infallible method of re&s;toring health and vigour!</P>
<P>An emetic, if it act according to its intention, operates by a di&s;charge of the contents of the &s;tomach and of &s;ome of the mucous fluids; and this it does, either by &s;ome mechanical power which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of acting on the nervous &s;en&s;i|bility of its inner &s;urface, or by that relaxant property, of rendering the &s;tomach unable to retain its contents.</P>
<P>Yet as the immediate &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e is in the mucous ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and as the &s;tomach is already in a relaxed and weakened &s;tate; a parti|cular medicine applied &s;olely to that organ, and one who&s;e profe&s;&s;ed object is to evacuate, mu&s;t &s;urely be pernicious and u&s;ele&s;s. For although by its local effect, and by the exertion of &s;training, expectoration may be promoted, and a temporary relief be obtained; yet the cau&s;e being increa&s;ed which gave ri&s;e to this collection, and a rude &s;hock being given to an already weakened &s;y&s;tem; the exhibition of an emetic, however it may &s;eem at
<PB N="22" REF="20">fir&s;t to relieve, mu&s;t eventually tend to exa&s;perate the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the collection which takes place in the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, is, as we have already &s;tated, a deficient per&s;piration, wherein the &s;y&s;tem is unable to throw off its redundant fluids: by &s;tagnation they in&s;pi&s;&s;ate and form mucus; and by occupying more &s;pace than is natural create a difficulty of breathing. Now if deficient per&s;pira|tion be the effect of debility, debility will be the original cau&s;e; and any medicine capable of pro|ducing that effect, will be capable al&s;o of en|crea&s;ing the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>An emetic by depriving the &s;tomach of its contents, deprives it of that which might enable it to re&s;i&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e. It exhau&s;ts and weakens an organ which requires &s;upport and nouri&s;hment, and encrea&s;es that debility which was already too pre|valent: mucus or phlegm as it is termed, it is true, is during the action of vomiting di&s;charged; but in trifling proportion, and with con&s;iderable di&s;advantage, the thinner parts alone being rejected and the den&s;er retained.</P>
<P>But if any one &s;hould take occa&s;ion to &s;ay, "we admit the truth of what you have a&s;&s;erted, that
<PB N="23" REF="21">this is a di&s;ea&s;e of debility, and that emetics though they afford a temporary relief, ultimately debilitate; yet as the&s;e fluids are already collected, and as the patient is in a &s;tate of fuffocation by their retention; what remedy can be found to &s;upply the place of an emetic, and &s;ucceed &s;o well in di&s;charging them from the &s;y&s;tem?" To this I immediately an&s;wer; &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;tem and the fluids will be di&s;per&s;ed; encrea&s;e the per&s;piration and they will be re&s;olved; pre&s;cribe cordials and they will be expelled.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e then being admitted to be a di&s;ea&s;e of debility, any medicine capable of invigorating the whole &s;y&s;tem will be found to be beneficial; and it is upon this principle and no other that bark, opium, cicuta, and other remedies have proved &s;ucce&s;sful. That they frequently fail, ari&s;es perhaps from this cau&s;e, that they are depended upon &s;in|gly, and con&s;idered as &s;pecifics; but as I have already endeavoured to &s;hew the non-exi&s;tence of a &s;pecific in nature, if my po&s;ition be granted, it will be ea&s;y to prove that where the principle is fal&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t be uncertain.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by the late Dr. John&s;on, that nothing has ever been well done by a receipt; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have attended patients
<PB N="24" REF="22">with the Hooping Cough, where neither bark, opium, nor cicuta have been employed, and where notwith&s;tanding the recovery was complete.</P>
<P>It is not from any one particular form or &s;y&s;tem that di&s;ea&s;es are to be eradicated and health e&s;tab|li&s;hed; yet as example is at all times more effica|cious than precept, a few authentic Ca&s;es, while they demon&s;trate a plan of treatment, may &s;erve to explain the principles upon which that treatment was founded.</P>
<P>And as I have ever deemed it to be the indi&s;pen|&s;ible duty of a Practitioner to give a faithful relation of facts though they may include events of an unplea&s;ant nature; &s;o have I always thought that the relation of un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es is more than ever requi&s;ite, when any con&s;ideration of importance or means of improvement are to be deduced from them.</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>On the 26th of Augu&s;t 1793, I was de&s;ired to &s;end an emetic to a child of about four years of age, who was troubled with the Hooping Cough; as I never before had an opportunity of &s;eeing a complete ca&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, and as I had &s;ome doubts re&s;pecting the propriety of emetics, I con|&s;idered this as a favourable opportunity of watching the progre&s;s and event; and as I attended in the Family, profited by the occa&s;ion. The child po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a tolerable &s;hare of health, and with the exception of the cough having no other particular &s;ymptom of di&s;ea&s;e, had rendered any previous attendance unnece&s;&s;ary. Upon calling the next day I was informed that the emetic had been given, and as u&s;ual, had brought up a con&s;iderable quan|tity of phlegm; the cough, however, was more trouble&s;ome, and the patient very re&s;tle&s;s. The following medicine was immediately pre&s;cribed.</P>

The breathing was become high and laborious; the countenance pale, and the convul&s;ive motion of the no&s;trils was very evident; together with the&s;e formidable &s;ymptoms, a violent Diarrhoea came on, and it &s;eemed to be the general opinion that the patient could not &s;urvive.

<P>3d. Much better, begins to &s;uck, which he had before been unable to do; and to conclude, in the cour&s;e of about a fortnight at farthe&s;t, by a con|tinuance of cordial medicines with &s;mall do&s;es of P. Rhab. the Patient completely recovered, and has been well ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>I have particularized this ca&s;e, not becau&s;e I think that there was any thing very remarkable in it, but becau&s;e it was confidently a&s;&s;erted that the child could not recover; the mother and nur&s;e had at one time given it up as hopele&s;s, and but for my per&s;ua&s;ion would have left it to its fate, and becau&s;e no emetic had been given from the commencement to the conclu&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 3d of October I was called to a Family where four children had the Hooping Cough; but as I think it would be needle&s;s to enter into a parti|cular detail of the medicines which were given, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of temperate cordials, light and nouri&s;hing diet, gentle exerci&s;e, and clear air, they all completely recovered.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="31">
<P>I have &s;ince attended &s;everal children, who by the &s;ame treatment, and with the exclu&s;ion of emetics, have all recovered; but I mu&s;t pa&s;s them over to come to a Ca&s;e which proved un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

<P>2nd. The cough being trouble&s;ome, I was &s;olicited for an emetic, but gave an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ing my doubt of its efficacy. The medicine was continued; but on the</P>
<P>3d. As the patient &s;eemed to be very much op|pre&s;&s;ed in his breathing, and choaked with phlegm, I yielded to &s;olicitation, and an emetic was &s;ent. From that time the patient gradually drooped, and notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t vigilance and attention, and the mo&s;t vigorous application of medicines of the mo&s;t powerful kind, on the 7th in the even|ing died.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="32">
<P>I am &s;o well convinced in this ca&s;e of the eme|tic's proving pernicious, that I &s;hall never con&s;ent to hazard the experiment a &s;econd time; and if any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that he has given an emetic for a cough, and experienced its efficacy, I &s;hall an&s;wer, "It is po&s;&s;ible you may have cured a cough by emetics, but I do not believe that cough was the Hooping Cough."</P>
<P>The la&s;t ca&s;e which I &s;hall offer is that of an infant of &s;omething more than three months old; who from being in a very imminent &s;tate of danger, was happily recovered in le&s;s than a fortnight's time.</P>
<P>The medicines were of the cordial kind; cly&s;ters were given; nutritive broths with a moderate quantity of wine: and I can here with truth and confidence a&s;&s;ert, that (excepting the one I have mentioned) I have never had a ca&s;e of Hooping Cough which did not yield to this plan of treat|ment.</P>
<P>As I have rather exceeded the limits of a paper, I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to a conclu&s;ion. To tho&s;e who may think that I have been pre&s;umptuous in my opi|nions and confident in my a&s;&s;ertions, I &s;hall beg
<PB N="35" REF="33"> leave to oppo&s;e the authority of a celebrated Phy&s;i|cian.
<Q>"In Hooping Cough,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>"change of climate is an idle tale, and the practice of vomiting death."</Q></P>
<P>I have &s;aid that this di&s;ea&s;e is rapid in its pro|gre&s;s and fatal in its effects; and I cannot bring a better in&s;tance than that of a child who going to a baker's, in who&s;e family it prevailed, to purcha&s;e a roll, caught it, returned home, and being &s;eized with a fit of coughing, bur&s;t a blood-ve&s;&s;el and in&s;tantly expired: and that of a mother who was bereft of two children, both of whom were cut off in &s;omewhat le&s;s than eight and forty hours, with|out having received any treatment: and no other medicine than that abominable cu&s;tom, which can|not be too &s;trongly reprobated, and which is &s;o pre|valent among the Poor e&s;pecially, viz. of giving their children repeated do&s;es of Vin. Antim. or Tart. Emet. without either knowledge to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or judgment to direct them: &s;o bigotted indeed are they to the&s;e medicines, that they think them uni|ver&s;al no&s;trums; and I am acquainted with a family where Vin. Antim. is regularly admini&s;tered to the children once or twice a week; by way, as it is termed, of clearing the bile from their &s;tomachs! Good God! are there not already &s;ufficient calami|ties for &s;uffering humanity, that we &s;hould &s;o
<PB N="36" REF="34">&s;tudiou&s;ly endeavour to create di&s;ea&s;es, where none previou&s;ly exi&s;ted, and thus dig pitfalls for our own de&s;truction!</P>
<P>It is not with medicine, as with other arts and &s;ciences, where a mi&s;take may be rectified, and an amendment adopted: alas! dear-bought experience frequently comes too late, and the nature and cau&s;e of a complaint may be di&s;covered when the occa&s;ion for it is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I call therefore upon this Society, in their indivi|dual as well as in their collective capacity, to di&s;|countenance and check the imprudent exhibitions of em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tics. I have brought forward proofs of their in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">acy and ill effects: I have &s;hewn the &s;ucce&s;s of a different plan of treatment: and I conjure them, by all that is valuable and &s;acred, to let not the&s;e te&s;timonies be brought in vain.</P>
