<HEAD>THE <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>U&s;efulne&s;s</HI> OF THE DISPENSARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> in <HI>London</HI> and &s;even miles round, being for near two hundred Years &s;etled by Law wholly in the <HI>College of Phy&s;icians</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;uch as they approve of upon Examination, and Licen&s;e; 'tis worth the while to enquire by what means they come to enjoy &s;o &s;mall a part of it. Chymi&s;ts and Di&s;tillers, A&s;trologers and Mountebanks, Midwives and Nur&s;es, and the whole Train of Broken-Trade&s;men-Doctors have every one their &s;hare. There are not a few that are their own Doctors, and practi&s;e upon them&s;elves; and there is hardly any one &s;o unkind, as not to recommend to his &s;ick Friend what has done him&s;elf good. The College can only blame the&s;e la&s;t for Indi&s;|cretion: And the former are the mo&s;t of them hardly worth the charge of a Pro&s;ecution: yet the College have been ever and anon making an example of one or other of them, to &s;trike terror into the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But when I have reckoned up the&s;e and as many more &s;uch as the&s;e, they have hardly all of them invaded the tenth part of the practice that one &s;ingle &s;ort of Men have u&s;urpt, <HI>viz.</HI> the Apothecaries. And the&s;e not only practi&s;e, but pretend to a <HI>Right,</HI> and to a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &s;o to do. As to their <HI>Right,</HI> tho' the Honourable Court of Kings Bench have more than once qua&s;ht that pretence, and have &s;ufficiently determined the matter again&s;t them; yet I &s;hall pre&s;ume to give a touch at it, after|wards
<PB N="2" REF="3">in this Paper. But as to the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which they plead, I will con&s;ider that here.</P>
<P>They plead a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to practi&s;e upon the <HI>Rich,</HI> becau&s;e ma|ny times they cannot per&s;uade the&s;e to &s;end for a Phy&s;ician, when yet 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that &s;omething &s;hould be done, and therefore <HI>they mu&s;t</HI> do it. Now this &s;eems a very odd way of arguing, That if the Patient will not &s;end for a Phy&s;ician, the Apothecary <HI>mu&s;t needs</HI> undertake the Cure. For if the Patient be covetous, or fool-hardy, or will not believe him&s;elf ill e|nough to have the advice of a Phy&s;ician, what's that to the Apo|thecary? Yes, for if one Apothecary will not give him &s;ome|thing, another will; and &s;o the fir&s;t &s;hall lo&s;e a Patient. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s is a kind of nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>&s;e defendendo,</HI> for one A|pothecary to defend him&s;elf from the inva&s;ion of another: But this is far from proving a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> with re&s;pect to the Patient, who I dare &s;ay had generally much better be without any of them.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to practi&s;e upon the <HI>Rich,</HI> is, when they are taken &s;uddenly ill, and no Phy&s;ician can be met with. As to Practi&s;ing in this ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o long as &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity la&s;ts, I dare &s;ecure the Apothecaries, or any other per&s;on that does his be&s;t in &s;uch urgent Ca&s;es, that they &s;hall never be trou|bled for it by the College. But this Nece&s;&s;ity is far from ju&s;ti|fying the Apothecaries continuing to practi&s;e even upon &s;uch Patients from day to day, when better advice may be had.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Ca&s;es, I think, are the only ones for which they can plead <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> with re&s;pect to their practi&s;ing upon the <HI>Rich;</HI> and how far they are from excu&s;ing or ju&s;tifying their practi&s;ing upon any <HI>&s;uch</HI> for Weeks or Months together (as they commonly do) is too obvious to be farther examin'd.</P>
<P>But then how &s;hall I get over the other <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> the <HI>great Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> with re&s;pect to the <HI>Poor,</HI> who, if you will believe the Apothecaries, would all peri&s;h for want of looking to, if <HI>they</HI> did not take care of them: for the Phy&s;icians (of the College) they &s;ay, will only vi&s;it the Rich that can Fee them well.</P>
<P>I believe, this accu&s;ation of the College-Phy&s;icians was <HI>never true:</HI> But that for <HI>&s;everal Years</HI> by-pa&s;t it has been notoriou&s;ly <HI>fal&s;e,</HI> is known to the whole Town. For, that the Phy&s;icians
<PB N="3" REF="4">might clear them&s;elves of this <HI>fal&s;e charge,</HI> they have been ob|liged to &s;et their care of the Poor more in the eyes of the World than heretofore; not only giving advice <HI>gratis</HI> to the Poor at their own and the Patients Lodgings, but appointing publick Di&s;pen&s;aries al&s;o for the Poor to re&s;ort to every day of the week (except Sundays) where they may both have the be&s;t ad|vice <HI>gratis,</HI> and al&s;o proper Medicins for their re&s;pective Ca|&s;es at the lowe&s;t value: whereby the Poor are at once delivered from the danger of the Apothecaries ignorance in practice, and al&s;o from the oppre&s;&s;ive charge of his Medicins.</P>
<P>And the College have been forced to take this Cour&s;e, not only to clear them&s;elves of the a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon them, but al&s;o to make their charity in advi&s;ing <HI>gratis,</HI> truly &s;erviceable to the Poor: For unle&s;s Phy&s;icians could teach the Poor to make &s;omething them&s;elves, their advice was &s;eldom followed; be|cau&s;e the Apothecaries u&s;ed to make them pay &s;o dear for their Phy&s;ick, and could by no Overtures or Arguments be induced to abate of their prices, tho' often pre&s;t to it by the Phy&s;icians, as clearly appears in a Paper &s;ome years ago publi&s;hed under the Title of <HI>A &s;hort Account of the proceedings of the College of Phy&s;icians,</HI> London, <HI>in relation to the &s;ick Poor of the &s;aid City,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding that the Phy&s;icians, as appears in the &s;aid Paper, were &s;o forward to advi&s;e the Poor <HI>gratis,</HI> and the Apo|thecaries &s;o backward in contributing their part; yet the&s;e did not only continue to in&s;inuate to the Town, that the care of the Poor lay wholly upon them; but when about &s;even years ago they petitioned the High Court of Parliament to be exempt|ed from Offices as the Phy&s;icians are, they had the confidence to &s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame <HI>there</HI> al&s;o, and endeavoured to get a Clau&s;e in their Bill, that they might have liberty to give Phy&s;ick to the Poor, who otherwi&s;e were like to peri&s;h for want of due care to be taken of them.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians being thus unju&s;tly calumniated before the whole Nation, 'twas high time for them to think of an effectual remedy. Wherefore <HI>Dec.</HI> 22. 1696. a Propo&s;al was made in the publick College for a &s;ub&s;cription by the &s;everal Members thereof, to rai&s;e a Fund for the furni&s;hing a Repo&s;itory of Medicins for the u&s;e of the Poor: which Propo&s;al was then approved of,
<PB N="4" REF="5">and a &s;ub&s;cription immediately made to the effect follow|ing.</P>
<P><Q>"Whereas the &s;everal Orders of the College of Phy&s;icians <HI>London,</HI> for pre&s;cribing Medicins <HI>gratis</HI> to the Poor Sick of the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and parts adjacent, as al&s;o the Propo&s;als made by the &s;aid College to the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and Common Council of <HI>London,</HI> in pur|&s;uance thereof, have hitherto been ineffectual, for that no Me|thod hath been taken to furni&s;h the Poor with Medicins for their Cure at low and rea&s;onable rates: We therefore who&s;e Names are here underwritten, Fellows or Members of the &s;aid College, being willing effectually to promote &s;o great a Chari|ty, by the coun&s;el and good liking of the Pre&s;ident and College declared in their <HI>Comitia,</HI> hereby (to wit, each of us &s;everally and apart, and not the one for the other of us) do oblige our &s;elves to pay to Dr. <HI>Thomas Burwel,</HI> Fellow and Elect of the &s;aid College, the &s;umm of Ten Pounds apiece of Lawful money of <HI>England,</HI> by &s;uch proportions, and at &s;uch times as to the major part of the Sub&s;cribers hereto &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t con|venient: Which Money when received by the &s;aid Dr. <HI>Thomas Burwel,</HI> is to be by him expended in preparing and delivering Medicins to the Poor at their intrin&s;ick value, in &s;uch man|ner, and at &s;uch times, and by &s;uch Orders and Directions, as by the major part of the Sub&s;cribers hereto, &s;hall in writing be hereafter appointed and directed for that purpo&s;e. In Witne&s;s whereof we have hereunto &s;et our hands and Seals this 22. <HI>December</HI> 1696."</Q></P>
<P>This was in a few days &s;ub&s;cribed by above <HI>forty,</HI> (and has by &s;everal more, &s;ince.)</P>
<P>The Sub&s;cription being made, a College was called, That a Grant might be forthwith made by way of Lea&s;e to the Sub&s;cri|bers, of the College-Laboratory, and other Rooms and conve|niencies nece&s;&s;ary for executing the intended Charitable de&s;ign: And a Grant was accordingly made and Sealed in open College. Whereupon the Sub&s;cribers pre&s;ently cho&s;e a Committee of twelve to manage this affair, who were &s;o diligent in it, that in about half a year they got it into a &s;erviceable condition and method.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>But this de&s;ign being wholly new, no wonder if at fir&s;t it was not brought to that degree of Serviceablene&s;s it is now improved to. At fir&s;t tho&s;e Poor only were &s;upplied with Medicins that repaired for advice to the &s;everal Sub&s;cribers Lodgings, or tho&s;e whom they were called to in their re&s;pective Neighbourhoods; which in compari&s;on were but few: for the Apothecaries &s;till made a &s;hift to keep mo&s;t of them in their own hands, &s;o loth were they to part with their objects of Charity, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves. Wherefore the Sub&s;cribers thought it advi&s;eable for the inlarging of their Charity, to appoint certain days wherein two Phy&s;icians (by turns) &s;hould attend at the College, to give advice <HI>gratis</HI> to all the Poor that would re&s;ort thither; and to give notice of this not only in the publick Prints, but al&s;o by Papers which they printed and gave away for the in|formation of the Town. By this means far greater Numbers flocked for advice, and many from the remote&s;t parts of the Town; for who&s;e conveniency it has been thought fit not only to continue the Attendance (with the Di&s;pen&s;ary for Medicins) at the College; but al&s;o to erect two Di&s;pen&s;aries more, one in S. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Lane in the Fields, and the other in <HI>Grace-Church &s;treet,</HI> that the &s;ick Poor might not have too far to go for relief; and might at one or other of the&s;e Places have advice any day in the Week, and Medicins every day at all of them. Thus two Phy&s;icians attend in the afternoons on <HI>Monday</HI> in S. <HI>Martin</HI>'s, on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> in <HI>Grace-Church-&s;treet,</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> at the College; and &s;o on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> in S. <HI>Martin</HI>'s, on <HI>Friday</HI> in <HI>Grace-Church-&s;treet,</HI> and on <HI>Saturday</HI> at the College. And the Phy&s;icians attendance at the&s;e Places, is not intended at all to excu&s;e any Sub&s;criber from giving advice <HI>gratis</HI> at his own Hou&s;e or in his Neighbour|hood: But becau&s;e a Phy&s;icians hours are uncertain, being obli|ged to be abroad whenever called; that the Poor who can ill lo&s;e time, may not be di&s;appointed when they &s;eek for advice, <HI>certain</HI> provi&s;ion is made for them by the&s;e fixed <HI>days</HI> and <HI>places.</HI></P>
<P>By this means 'tis hoped the Phy&s;icians have &s;ufficiently wiped off the Scandal they lay &s;o long unju&s;tly under, and the Poor have that care taken of them, and kindne&s;s &s;hew'd them, that we challenge any City in <HI>Europe</HI> to parallel.</P>
<P>The Committee who are new cho&s;en every Year, meet twice
<PB N="6" REF="7">every Week for the looking after the due management of this Undertaking: and they chu&s;e two Curators Monthly, who&s;e peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s it is to buy in the be&s;t Drugs they can meet with, and to &s;ee that the Compo&s;itions for the Di&s;pen&s;aries be duly prepared. And that the&s;e may be the better in&s;pected, they are all ordered to be made at the College, and to be con|veyed from thence to the other two Di&s;pen&s;aries as they are wanted.</P>
<P>And as the Medicins at all the Di&s;pen&s;aries are the be&s;t that can be made: So they are &s;old out for no greater gains than will ju&s;t bear the Charge, <HI>viz.</HI> of Hou&s;e-Rent and Servants wa|ges. So that the Price is ordinarily 8<HI>d.</HI> or 9<HI>d.</HI> in the Shilling le&s;s than the Apothecaries u&s;e to exact.</P>
<P>And now that the Poor are &s;o very well taken care of by the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;aries, one would think the Apotheca|ries &s;hould be very thankful that &s;o much trouble is taken off their hands: But in&s;tead of that, (to &s;hew that their <HI>gains</HI> by Practi&s;ing upon the Poor, is more in their eye, than <HI>their relief</HI>) they rail every where again&s;t the Sub&s;cribers as men that would undo them, and have entred into a Combination to hinder them of all the bu&s;ine&s;s they po&s;&s;ibly can: while they care&s;s and bring into bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uch Phy&s;icians as have refu&s;ed to be concerned in the Sub&s;cription. They make it their bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o in all Com|panies, to rai&s;e Objections again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;aries, as well as to mi&s;repre&s;ent the de&s;igns of tho&s;e that have &s;et them up. As I have therefore plainly &s;hewn the Sub&s;cribers de&s;ign to be the mo&s;t Laudable that can be; and that they were nece&s;&s;itated to erect them, as well for the relief of the Poor, as in their own vindication: So to prevent all groundle&s;s prejudices, I will give a full An&s;wer to all &s;uch Objections as the Apothecaries have rai&s;ed again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Objections</HI> may, I think, be reduced to &s;ix.</P>
<P N="1">I. They &s;ay, <HI>That Phy&s;icians ought not to give Phy&s;ick, but only pre&s;cribe it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That they have no right to erect publick Di&s;pen&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That if the Di&s;pen&s;aries be &s;uffered, the Apothecaries will all be undone.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That Phy&s;icians Fees are as unrea&s;onable and oppre&s;&s;ive, as the Apothecaries prices.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P N="5">V. <HI>That the Rich are &s;upplyed with Medicins from the Di&s;pen&s;aries as well as the Poor.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>That the Di&s;pen&s;aries &s;ell Medicins as dear as the Apothe|caries.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 1. <HI>That Phy&s;icians ought not to give Phy&s;ick, but only pre|&s;cribe it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It might &s;uffice in an&s;wer to this to &s;ay, that it is as little the Apothecaries province to <HI>advi&s;e</HI> the &s;ick, as they can &s;uppo&s;e it to be the Phy&s;icians to <HI>give</HI> them <HI>Phy&s;ick:</HI> and yet where is the Apothecary that does not do this every day? How unfit then are the Apothecaries to impute that as a Crime to Phy&s;icians, which they are &s;o notoriou&s;ly guilty of them&s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> of intruding into other Mens bu&s;ine&s;s? I &s;ay, this might &s;uffice as an An&s;wer to <HI>them:</HI> but I &s;hall con&s;ider the accu&s;ation <HI>it &s;elf,</HI> and demon&s;trate, that Phy&s;icians when they give Phy&s;ick, are in their own lawful proper bu&s;ine&s;s; and that Apothecaries are not &s;o, when they pre&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>When a Phy&s;ician has arrived at the skill to know Di&s;ea&s;es and their Symptoms, and to take Indications for their Cure as to the <HI>quid agendum;</HI> he mu&s;t then proceed to find out the <HI>quo, i. e.</HI> Operations, or Medicins, to &s;atisfie tho&s;e Indications: And when he has found the&s;e out, can any Man think it rea&s;onable, that he &s;hould be obliged to communicate all his skill in every particular Cure, to what per&s;on &s;oever the Patient is plea&s;ed to call in for an Apothecary, &s;o as to make him pre&s;ently Ma&s;ter of all tho&s;e Secrets that by long &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation he has arrived at the knowledg of? Who&s;oever is the Author but of one Invention u&s;eful to the Publick, has a right by Law to the &s;ole benefit of it for many years: And &s;hall Phy&s;icians that are continually inventing new and more effectual Remedies for the Di&s;ea&s;es of Mankind, be bound to divulge and pro&s;titute all their Inventions to Men, that if <HI>they</HI> can help it, will never let the Inventors have twice the benefit of the &s;ame Pre&s;cription, but pre&s;ently u&s;urp the u&s;e of it them&s;elves, and leave the Phy|&s;icians at lei&s;ure to invent more? I know the Apothecary that is ignorant of the Rea&s;ons and Natures of things, by <HI>unfitly applying</HI> good Remedies &s;hall never perform the &s;ame Cures that the learned Phy&s;ician can: but while the Apothecaries pretend
<PB N="8" REF="9">to do it, and give tho&s;e remedies to Patients, tho' the&s;e receive no benefit, the Phy&s;ician is no le&s;s injur'd. I &s;ay then, 'tis again&s;t all the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice in the World, to hinder the Phy&s;ician him&s;elf from admini&s;tring to the &s;ick &s;uch remedies as he has invented. 'Tis as ab&s;urd, as to hinder a Workman from u&s;ing his own Tools which he has invented, and which he alone knows the right u&s;e of. And the Parliament of 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. for this, and other weighty rea&s;ons, did wi&s;ely enact, <Q>"That any Phy&s;ician being admitted by the Pre&s;ident and Fellow&s;hip of Phy&s;icians in <HI>London,</HI> may any where within this Realm practi&s;e and exerci&s;e the Science of Phy&s;ick in all and every its members and parts."</Q> Which Clau&s;e is plainly applied to making and giving Medicins, in the Charter granted to the Apo|thecaries by K. <HI>James</HI> I. For after the Charter had granted them divers Immunities, Powers and Privileges, particularly the &s;ole making and vending of internal remedies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at length there is this Clau&s;e added: <HI>Et deni&abque; volumus &mdash; quod Frae&s;i|deus &amp; Communitas Medicor. (Civit. Lond.) omne&s;&abque; &amp; &s;inguli Medici de eodem Collegio &s;ive Communitate, &amp; &s;ucce&s;&s;ores &s;ui, &s;icut &amp; Me|dici Regis, Reginae &amp; Principum impo&s;terum debeant, &amp; pro arbitrio &s;uo po&s;&s;int artem medicam in omnibus &s;uis partibus exercere,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> <Q>"And la&s;tly we will &mdash; That the Pre&s;ident and Commonalty of Phy&s;icians (in the City of <HI>London</HI>) and all and every the Phy&s;icians of the &s;ame College or Commonalty, and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, as al&s;o the Phy&s;icians of the King, Queen and Princes, hereafter ought, and at their plea&s;ure may exerci&s;e the Art of Phy&s;ick in all its parts."</Q> And to drive the matter yet further out of all di&s;pute, it is immediately added, <HI>&amp; in&s;uper gaudebunt, utentur &amp; fruentur, &amp; gaudere, uti &amp; frui valeant &amp; po&s;&s;int ei&s;dem &amp; con&s;imil. juri&s;dictionibus, authoritat. &s;upervi&s;. &amp; correctionibus, ac omnibus aliis</HI> pote&s;tatibus, privileg. <HI>&amp; libertat. qualibus unquam antehac Pharmacopolae u&s;i &amp; gavi&s;i fuerunt,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> <Q>"And &s;hall moreover enjoy and u&s;e, and have a right to enjoy and u&s;e the &s;ame and like Juri&s;dictions, Authorities, Supervi&s;ings and Cor|rections, and all other POWERS, PRIVILEDGES and Liberties which the Apothecaries have ever hitherto u&s;ed and enjoyed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> What words can be more comprehen&s;ive and full to continue in the Phy&s;icians of the College an equal
<PB N="9" REF="10"><HI>power</HI> and <HI>priviledge</HI> with Apothecaries them&s;elves, to make and vend Medicins?</P>
<P>But where is the clau&s;e in any Statute or Charter (even their own) that gives or re&s;erves a power to the Apothecaries to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick, and to di&s;pen&s;e out all the Medicins in their Shops to Patients without the pre&s;cription or advice of any Phy|&s;ician? If they can &s;hew none, then I affirm, that they do this again&s;t plain po&s;itive Law, while Phy&s;icians have Law as plain and po&s;itive to empower them to prepare and give Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. <HI>That Phy&s;icians have no right to erect publick Di&s;pen|&s;aries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, that it &s;eems &s;trange, if each particular Phy&s;ician have power by Law to prepare and give his own Phy&s;ick, (as has been &s;hewn) that two or three, or any number of the&s;e Phy&s;icians, may not for their own convenience prepare their Medicins together, and have one common place from whence to di&s;pen&s;e them; e&s;pecially when all the benefit of &s;uch conve|niency accrues to the Patient, who by that means has his Medi|cins con&s;iderably cheaper than they could be afforded, if every Phy|&s;ician were at the charge to keep Servants and a Di&s;pen&s;ary of his own. But &s;uppo&s;e there were any weight in this Objection, of what advantage would it be to the Apothecaries to have the Phy&s;i|cians debarr'd from this convenience? There would perhaps in &s;uch Ca&s;e be as many Di&s;pen&s;aries as there are now Sub&s;cribers to the three in being: And whereas each Sub&s;criber &s;ends in compari&s;on but few of his Patients at pre&s;ent to the Di&s;pen&s;aries; if he had one at his own Hou&s;e, he would probably &s;upply all his Patients with his own Medicins. The Objectors therefore had much better, in my opinion, quietly endure three common Di&s;pen&s;aries &s;et up for the u&s;e of the Poor, than by endea|vouring to pull the&s;e down, to give occa&s;ion to &s;et up forty or fifty private ones, for the u&s;e of the Rich as well as the Poor.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. <HI>That if the Di&s;pen&s;aries are &s;uffered, the Apothecaries will all be undone.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that part of their bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially that relating to the Poor, mu&s;t indeed be abated; and that bu|&s;ine&s;s which they retain, will hardly be &s;o profitable to them as formerly, when the Rich under&s;tand how unrea&s;onable their
<PB N="10" REF="11">gains have been. But if the Apothecaries plea&s;e, they may in good part make up the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es by contenting them&s;elves to live in Hou&s;es of le&s;s Rent, to bear only the port of Labouring or handy-crafts-men (as indeed they are) but e&s;pecially by keeping fewer Servants, and putting their own hands to their own work, and by making &s;uch Bylaws to their Company in relation to ta|king Apprentices, as may le&s;&s;en the number of Apothecaries, who are now grown &s;o over numerous. And if notwith&s;tand|ing, they cannot get &s;o much by their Trade as they <HI>have</HI> done, every unprejudic'd Man will conclude it more rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, that a few Men &s;hould be le&s;&s;en'd in their gains and gran|deur, than that a thou&s;and times their number &s;hould be op|pre&s;s'd for the &s;upport of them. And all mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the ambition of the&s;e Men is very Extravagant, that de&s;ire with an hundred pound Stock (many not with half &s;o much) to vie with the be&s;t Shop-keepers or Merchants in their Neighbourhood, that employ fifty times as much in their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. <HI>That Phy&s;icians Fees are as unrea&s;onable and oppre&s;&s;ive as the Apothecaries prices.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis denied, that Phy&s;icians Fees are either unrea&s;ona|ble or oppre&s;&s;ive: For how &s;hould they be &s;o, when the Patient is at liberty to give what he plea&s;es? Every one is the be&s;t judge of his own condition and ability: And accordingly &s;ome give a Guinea, &s;ome ten Shillings, &s;ome a Crown and &s;ome nothing: And whatever other Phy&s;icians do, the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;|pen&s;aries profe&s;s them&s;elves as ready to &s;erve the two la&s;t as the two fir&s;t. And take the&s;e one with another, how far &s;hort will Phy&s;icians Fees come of tho&s;e of Lawyers, which yet are not di&s;|puted? And the di&s;proportion will &s;till appear the greater, when it is con&s;idered, that for one Client the Lawyers have <HI>in forma pauperis,</HI> the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;aries have fifty or an hundred <HI>gratis</HI> Patients, there being &s;everal hundreds of them every Week. So that take one Patient with another, Rich and Poor, and I dare confidently aver, that no Phy&s;ician that duly attends at the Di&s;pen&s;aries, has a Crown a Bill for all the Bills he writes through the Year; nay I can be po&s;itive, that &s;ome have not half a Crown. And what ground then can there be for this great cry again&s;t Phy&s;icians Fees?</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing they were indeed unrea&s;onable, this Objection would only argue, that Phy&s;icians were not fit per&s;ons to accu&s;e the Apothecaries of exce&s;&s;ive gains; but it does no way excu&s;e or ju&s;tifie <HI>them.</HI> And I will make it appear, that there is no proportion between <HI>their</HI> gains and Phy&s;icians <HI>Fees.</HI> In Chronical Ca&s;es, when the Patient can come to the Phy&s;ician, he ordinarily gives him but half a Fee; for which he expects to be put into a cour&s;e of Phy&s;ick that &s;hall cure him, which generally la&s;ts &s;everal Weeks. In this time the Phy&s;ick commonly comes to &s;everal pounds; of which, three parts in four at lea&s;t &s;hall be gains, (as I will undertake to prove, if it be denied.) And if the &s;ame Patient chance to relap&s;e into the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, he &s;hall re|peat the cour&s;e <HI>toties quoties</HI> without ever con&s;ulting his Phy&s;ician again. So that by &s;uch a Patient the Apothecary &s;hall get (at time and time) perhaps twenty times as much as the Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Yea tho' the Patients Ca&s;e be acute and require the daily at|tendance of the Phy&s;ician, the Apothecary's gains &s;hall far ex|ceed <HI>his</HI> Fees, e&s;pecially if the Phy&s;ician be one of the Apothecaries Friends, and have the knack of <HI>writing well,</HI> as their cant is. I could give In&s;tances enow of this: But I appeal to the experience of mo&s;t that have been &s;ick of Fevers (for in&s;tance) wherein they have had an Apothecary, with a Phy&s;ician of <HI>his</HI> recommending: Let them ca&s;t up the Phy&s;ician's Fees, and compute three parts in four (at lea&s;t) of the Apothecaries Bill to be gains, and they &s;hall generally find the latter greatly to outbalance the former. Only I mu&s;t here except two or three Phy&s;icians (not concerned in the Di&s;pen&s;aries) who have got a way (under the &s;pecious pretence of being <HI>careful</HI> Men) to vi&s;it their Patients twice or thrice a day, when once would &s;erve, only to Multiply their Fees. I am not writing an Apology for &s;uch; but am content they &s;hould fall under the &s;ame cen&s;ure with the Apothecaries, of being unrea&s;onable and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. <HI>That the Rich are &s;upplyed with Medicins from the Di&s;|pen&s;aries, as well as the Poor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The prime rea&s;on of &s;etting up the Di&s;pen&s;aries was (as has been &s;hewed) the &s;upplying the <HI>Poor</HI> with Medicins at a low rate: And that the Sub&s;cribers do &s;till put them to this u&s;e, hundreds of <HI>poor</HI> People can Weekly te&s;tifie. And if there are
<PB N="12" REF="13">any <HI>Rich</HI> &s;upplyed with Medicins from thence, the Apothecaries may thank them&s;elves for it. For this I will affirm, that what|&s;oever Phy&s;icians (Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;aries) &s;end their Rich Patients thither for Phy&s;ick, it is for one or more of the&s;e following Rea&s;ons. Either <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e of the general Combi|nation of the Apothecaries to keep out or turn out the Sub&s;cri|bers from all Patients where they have an intere&s;t to do it, in order to bring in tho&s;e Phy&s;icians that will not be concerned in the &s;ub&s;cription. And &s;o the Sub&s;cribers find this the only way to retain &s;ome of tho&s;e they have left. Or <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> becau&s;e the Apothecaries by &s;ending in ill prepared Medicins di&s;appoint them in their Practice, on purpo&s;e to make the Patients que&s;tion their Phy&s;ician's skill, and to &s;end for &s;ome other of <HI>their</HI> recom|mendation. (Which I have often known to be done.) Or <HI>Thirdly,</HI> when the Patients them&s;elves complain not only of the dearne&s;s but of the badne&s;s of their Apothecaries Medicins, and de&s;ire they may be &s;upplyed from the Di&s;pen&s;aries, where they are not only cheap, but good. Or <HI>fourthly,</HI> when the Apothecary has for many days together (even in dangerous and acute Di&s;ea&s;es) kept the Patient in his own hands, till almo&s;t all opportunity of bene|fiting him is lo&s;t: For in &s;uch Ca&s;es the Sub&s;cribers think it ju&s;t, that the Apothecaries &s;hould receive &s;ome check, to deter them from &s;uch unfair and dangerous Practices. Or <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> when the Phy&s;ician pre&s;cribes &s;ome &s;ecret Medicin that is kept at the Di&s;pen&s;aries, which he thinks not fit to make known to the Apothecaries, le&s;t they &s;hould pre&s;ently (as is u&s;ual with them) fall a practi&s;ing therewith them&s;elves to his di&s;advantage. And to the&s;e I may add a <HI>Sixth</HI> rea&s;on, which is only accidental, <HI>viz.</HI> When Per&s;ons of Condition come to the Di&s;pen&s;aries for <HI>gratis</HI> advice on the u&s;ual days, <HI>in forma pauperum,</HI> and the Phy&s;icians attending are ignorant of their quality, and &s;o are impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons I alledge in an&s;wer to this <HI>fifth</HI> Objection, not that the Sub&s;cribers need give a rea&s;on for what they do in this particular (for they have an undoubted right to give Phy&s;ick to whom they plea&s;e, as I have proved before in the an&s;wer to <HI>Obj.</HI> 1.) but that all the World may &s;ee, how <HI>every way</HI> ju&s;tifiable the Sub&s;cribers are, as to any complaint the Apothecaries make
<PB N="13" REF="14">again&s;t them. And after all the noi&s;e of &s;ending the Rich to the Di&s;pen&s;aries for Medicins, I dare &s;ay, take all the Sub&s;cri|bers together, and they do not &s;end one Bill in thirty (that they write for the Rich) thither: And if &s;ome &s;end more than others, it is upon account of greater injuries and affronts they have met with from the Apothecaries, for appearing more for|ward than their Brethren in this charitable Undertaking.</P>
<P>Obj. 6. The la&s;t <HI>Objection</HI> is, <HI>That the Di&s;pen&s;aries &s;ell Medicins as dear as the Apothecaries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 'Tis confe&s;t, that &s;ome Apothecaries, e&s;pecially the Whole&s;ale ones, do &s;ell &s;ome Medicins as cheap as the Di&s;pen|&s;aries can afford them. But pray what Medicins are they? They are either &s;imple Medicins and Drugs, the nature and value whereof mo&s;t people know; or &s;uch &s;ingle compound Medicins as are kept ready prepared in Shops, to be &s;old out when call'd for, by their proper and peculiar names, the value whereof is as commonly known as that of Drugs and Simples. As for in|&s;tance, Venice Treacle, Mithridate, <HI>Dia&s;cordium,</HI> &amp;c. tho' very compounded Medicins, are &s;old as cheap (I will not &s;ay &s;o good) by the Whole&s;ale Apothecaries as at the Di&s;pen&s;aries; and the rea&s;on is, the Buyer under&s;tands what he buys, and the current price of it, and &s;o cannot be impo&s;ed upon by the Apothecary. And the gains the Apothecary has by the&s;e Medicins thus &s;old, was never called unrea&s;onable and exce&s;&s;ive by the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;aries. But the gain complain'd of as unrea&s;onable and oppre&s;&s;ive, is, when Medicins either &s;imple or compound are mixt together, or di&s;gui&s;ed, and have a new name put upon them, denoting only their form, or their u&s;e and virtue, and the Patient is ignorant what they con&s;i&s;t of. As for in&s;tance, a Cordial <HI>bolus</HI> &s;hall be priced at 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> (by &s;ome at 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>) when the Ingredients of it are not worth 2 <HI>d.</HI> A do&s;e of purging Pills at the &s;ame price with the Cordial <HI>bolus,</HI> when they are on|ly half a dram of <HI>extract. Rudii, Pil. Ruffi,</HI> or <HI>Cochiae,</HI> worth 2 <HI>d.</HI> A Cordial draught &s;hall be 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> when the Waters and Syrup of which it con&s;i&s;ts, are dear of 3 <HI>d.</HI> A Vomit is 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> (or 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>) when it is not intrin&s;ecally worth above 1 <HI>d.</HI> or 2 <HI>d.</HI> A Sto|machick Apozem of a quart is never rated at le&s;s than 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> when the Ingredients that are boil'd in the water are bought for
<PB N="14" REF="15">3 <HI>d.</HI> or le&s;s, as in the bitter Decoction. And many Apothecaries are &s;o void of all Con&s;cience, as to make eight Shillings of &s;uch an Apozem, by dividing the quart into eight parts, and &s;end|ing it in to the Patient for &s;o many draughts (with &s;ome cramp name annexed) at 1 <HI>s. per</HI> draught. The like extravagant way of increa&s;ing the price do they very often take, by dividing an E|lectuary worth (it may be) 1 <HI>s.</HI> into twelve parts or more, and &s;ending in the parts &s;o divided to the Patient under the name of <HI>bolus</HI>'s at 1 <HI>s.</HI> a piece at lea&s;t. And &s;o if a Phy&s;ician pre&s;cribe a powder of an ounce, to be taken by half a dram at a time: Though the whole ounce be dear of a Shilling, as con&s;i&s;ting on|ly of te&s;taceous Powders, <HI>Sal prunellae,</HI> Sugar of Ro&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the Apothecary by officiou&s;ly dividing the ounce into &s;ixteen Papers, &s;hall make 8 <HI>s.</HI> of it, <HI>viz.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> a Paper. Now who&s;oever will take the pains to enquire, at what rate the very &s;ame <HI>bolus</HI>'s, Pills, Vomits, Cordial draughts, Apozems, Powders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are priced at the Di&s;pen&s;aries, he will &s;ee that they are generally at lea&s;t 9 <HI>d.</HI> in the Shilling cheaper than what the Apothecaries fell them for. Who then does not &s;ee a notorious fallacy in the Objection, when they affirm, that <HI>they</HI> &s;ell Medicins as cheap as the Di&s;pen&s;aries, when it holds not true in a fiftieth part? And only in tho&s;e, wherein the People cannot be impo&s;ed upon?</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, there is another circum&s;tance that makes it yet exceedingly dearer to have Phy&s;ick from the Apothecaries, than from the Di&s;pen&s;aries; and that is, that if either the Apothe|cary be Doctor him&s;elf and &s;end in Medicins to the &s;ick of his own head; or if he be able to bring in a Favourite Phy&s;ician that is an Enemy to the Di&s;pen&s;aries, they &s;hall either of them pour in upon the Patient three times as much Phy&s;ick as the Sub&s;cribers to the Di&s;pen&s;aries u&s;ually pre&s;cribe in like Ca&s;es, the greate&s;t part whereof, I dare be bold to &s;ay, is nothing to the purpo&s;e of the Cure, but &s;erves only for Pomp and to rai&s;e the Apothe|caries Bill, or perhaps does the Patient a great deal of harm.</P>
<P>So that take all con&s;iderations together, and who &s;ees not, that the Di&s;pen&s;aries are the greate&s;t relief to the Poor that can be imagined, when, for it may be, five Shillings they &s;hall have as much help in their re&s;pective Ca&s;es, as the Rich who are &s;up|plied
<PB N="15" REF="16">with Medicins from the Apothecaries, can have for five pounds? and at the &s;ame time have the ea&s;e of taking only a few nece&s;&s;ary Medicins, when the others are cramm'd and drench'd all day and night long with one &s;lap or other?</P>
<P>And now that I have given a full An&s;wer to all the <HI>Apothe|caries</HI> Objections again&s;t the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;aries,</HI> I &s;hould have put an end to this Paper, were there not two <HI>Objections</HI> more, com|monly to be met with in the Town, which it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething to, <HI>viz.</HI> One on the Apothecaries behalf, a|gain&s;t Phy&s;icians having the whole advi&s;ing part of Phy&s;ick; and the other again&s;t one particular in the pre&s;ent Management of the Di&s;pen&s;aries.</P>
<P N="1">1. On the Apothecaries behalf people argue, <HI>That an Apo|thecary who has for many Years made up Phy&s;icians Pre&s;criptions for Patients, and has ob&s;erved their Operations and effects, ought to have a right to admini&s;ter &s;uch Medicins as have had good effects, to other Patients in like Ca&s;es, when he is de&s;ired, without con&s;ulting any Phy&s;ician.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> In an&s;wer to this, we will fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that the Apo|thecary is of a capacity to make ob&s;ervations, and to know when a like Ca&s;e occurs; And yet in &s;uch ca&s;e I affirm, that he ought not of his own head to admini&s;ter the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful remedy to any other Patient than him for whom &s;uch remedy, was fir&s;t pre&s;cribed, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and when the Phy&s;ician that pre&s;cribed it cannot be had. For a Phy&s;ician has a <HI>double property</HI> in his Pre&s;criptions: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in that when a Phy&s;ician pre&s;cribes for a Patient, he pre&s;cribes only <HI>pro hoc &amp; nunc,</HI> for this Man and at this time; and for doing that alone he receives his Fee. He does not &s;ell his Pre&s;cription by way of alienation, &s;o that it &s;hould be to his Patient and to his Heirs or A&s;&s;igns for ever; much le&s;s does he pa&s;s any title over to the Apothecary, who is only employed by the Patient to make it up, and who ought to return the Bill when he is paid for it, either to the Patient, or to the Phy&s;i|cian that writ it: and if he either detain it, or tran&s;cribe it, in order to make u&s;e of it to other Patients, without the fir&s;t Pre&s;cribers lieve or direction, he is manife&s;tly guilty of frau|dulently u&s;urping anothers Property. <HI>Secondly,</HI> a Phy&s;ician
<PB N="16" REF="17">has another <HI>property</HI> in his Pre&s;criptions, in that no Man yb Law has a right to pre&s;cribe but him&s;elf: And as I take it, there is as real a property in <HI>Practice,</HI> as in <HI>E&s;tate.</HI> No Man ought to meddle in that <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> that he is not brought up to, or has not a Legal admi&s;&s;ion into. Not to mention the <HI>Mini&s;try;</HI> this is plain in the <HI>Law,</HI> wherein no Sollicitor or Attorney, how long &s;oever they have practi&s;ed, and how well &s;oever ver&s;ed in their bu&s;ine&s;s, can take upon them the practice of a Lawyer either in the Chamber or in Court. Preparing of Me|dicins is but one, and that the meane&s;t and mo&s;t mechanick part of Phy&s;ick: this part is committed to the Apothecaries by &s;uch Phy&s;icians as will not undergo the more &s;ervile and toil&s;ome part of their Profe&s;&s;ion, or through multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s are not at lei&s;ure for it; but &s;till it remains in&s;eparable from it, and what&s;oever Phy&s;ician will, may exerci&s;e it. But the Apo|thecary, who&s;e &s;ole Trade is to prepare Medicins according to the Di&s;pen&s;atories, or Recipe's put into his hands by Phy&s;icians, has no more a right to invade the advi&s;ing and pre&s;cribing part, than the Sollicitor or Attorney the practice of Councel learned in the Law.</P>
<P>But letting pa&s;s this argument from <HI>property,</HI> I will in further An&s;wer to the <HI>Objection</HI> demon&s;trate, <HI>that Apothecaries are not ca|pable of making ob&s;ervations, nor of judging of like Ca&s;es,</HI> and there|fore ought not to have the <HI>Right</HI> contended for.</P>
<P>Every one knows an Apothecary's Education to be, to come to the Trade from a Grammar School, where he has learned to con&s;true or to make a little Latin; 'Tis very rare that any de&s;igned for that employment, have any &s;mattering in the Greek. Thus qualified he comes Prentice, and is pre&s;ently &s;et to the Pe&s;til and Mortar, to run of errands, &amp;c. And after a Year or two when he has learned to know one thing in the Shop from another, and to read a Phy&s;icians Bill, he begins to be employed in making up Medicins and carrying them out to Patients, and continues &s;o to do till his time runs out. All this while he has neither time to read, nor can have capacity to under&s;tand &s;uch Books as teach the Art of Phy&s;ick: Nor can he know any thing (to any purpo&s;e) of the Di&s;ea&s;es for which the Medicins he car|ries out are admini&s;tred. For any Patient would reckon it Sanci|ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="18">in Boys to be inqui&s;itive about their Ca&s;es, in the enquiry whereinto a Man mu&s;t be very nice and particular, or he &s;hall be never the wi&s;er. And during this time of his Apprentice&s;hip he generally lo&s;es the little Latin that he had when he came from School, &s;aving what the Phy&s;icians Bills pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>Well, now he is out of his time, what mu&s;t he do but &s;et up? excellently qualified for the Practice of Phy&s;ick no doubt! Yes, there were &s;uch and &s;uch famous Doctors writ to his Ma&s;ter's Shop, and he &s;aw all their Bills, and made many of them up and carried them out to Patients, of whom he &s;aw &s;ome live, and &s;ome die; and &s;o he mu&s;t needs know &s;omething of the matter! Well, to judge of that, let us con&s;ider what the matter is, viz. <HI>The Art of Phy&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P>This Noble <HI>Art</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of five parts, of which the preparing of Medicins is but the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> part of <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>There is I. the <HI>Phy&s;iologick,</HI> which treats of the Subject and the end of Phy|&s;ick, and &s;o includes the Anatomy of an humane Body, and explains its con|&s;titution and that of all its parts, with their u&s;es and actions, and the faculties of the Animal Soul.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Pathologick,</HI> which treats of the nature, differences and cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es and their Symptoms, and explains every Particular wherein an humane Body departs from its natural con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Semiotick,</HI> which teaches the &s;igns whereby it may be known whether a Man is well or ill, and how di&s;ea&s;es latent in the body, with their cau&s;es, and events, may be di&s;covered: Which &s;igns are commonly called Diagno|&s;ticks and Progno&s;ticks.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The 4<HI>^t^h</HI> part contains the knowledge of tho&s;e things which are as it were the matter of health, and are u&s;ually called Non-naturals; as Air, Meat and Drink, Affections of the mind, exerci&s;e and re&s;t, Venery, Sleep and Watch|ing, with Excrements and Retents: And it contains al&s;o the knowledge of the right u&s;e of the&s;e Non-natural things, &s;o as that health may be pre&s;erv'd thereby.</P>
<P>And V. the fifth part, called the <HI>Therapeutick,</HI> &s;hews how loft health may be re&s;tored, and di&s;ea&s;es with their cau&s;es and Symptoms removed. And to this end 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;tructed, fir&s;t in <HI>Method,</HI> whereby according to indi|cations one may find out due <HI>helps;</HI> and then in the <HI>matter</HI> of &s;uch helps, whether contained under Diet, Surgery, or Pharmacy.</P>
<P>Now this very la&s;t thing (viz. <HI>Pharmacy</HI>) is all that an Apothecary by his education can pretend to the knowledge of: And it is but the lea&s;t part of this neither that he can have &s;uch pretence to. For the <HI>Pharmaceutick</HI> part contains not only the preparing of Medicins, but the knowledge of the Natures and Virtues of all tho&s;e things that are the matter of Medicins, whe|ther Vegetables, Animals, or Minerals, and this knowledge he is a &s;tranger to.</P>
<P>With what patience then can a Man animadvert upon the a&s;&s;uming confi|dence of the&s;e Men, who will &s;et up for Practi&s;ers in &s;uch a difficult and my&s;te|rious Art, that under&s;tand not any one part of it? A man is like to make <HI>&s;pecial Ob&s;ervations</HI> that neither knows the Subject affected, nor the nature nor cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, nor the nature of the Medicins that cure it. And he mu&s;t needs be a Witch at judging of <HI>like</HI> Ca&s;es, that for the mentioned defects could never be a competent judge of any one Ca&s;e.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="19">
<P>The Ca&s;e in &s;hort is this: An Apothecary when he learns his Trade, is taught to know one Drug from another, can tell which will melt, and which will powder, nay may ob&s;erve which will purge, which vomit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He learns al&s;o to make them up into different forms according to the pre&s;cripts of Phy&s;icians; and I will grant he has opportunity to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome are given mo&s;t commonly in Fevers, others in Con&s;umptions, others in Drop&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But will any Man conclude, that becau&s;e an Apothecary knows and may have ob&s;erved the&s;e things, that therefore he can judge with due accuratene&s;s either of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, or the Methods or Rea&s;ons of their Cure? There is no general Remedy nor Method for any one Di&s;ea&s;e: different Medicins and different Methods mu&s;t be made u&s;e of in different Subjects, tho' the Di&s;ea&s;e in the main be the &s;ame. And hereof no Man can be a fit Judge, but one who is well ver&s;ed in all the parts of Phy&s;ick. And therefore if there were no Law to re&s;train Apothecaries from practi&s;ing, their undeniabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnorance ought to keep all who value their Health or Lives, from depending on their advice.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other <HI>Objection</HI> that the People make, is again&s;t one particular thing in the pre&s;ent management of the Di&s;pen&s;aries, and is to this purpo&s;e: <HI>If,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>the Di&s;pen&s;aries &s;ell Medicins &s;o cheap and &s;o good, why may not any body have &s;uch Medicins there as they have occa&s;ion for, without the trouble of going to one of the Sub&s;cribers for a Note?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, 1. that People are not competent Judges of what they ail, or what will help them; and &s;o the Phy&s;icians are willing to prevent their doing them|&s;elves a mi&s;chief by taking improper things.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unle&s;s the Sub&s;cribers be &s;till more provok't by the Apothecaries in juries, they are very unwilling to make that of common u&s;e, which was purely de&s;ign|ed for the relief of the Poor only. For they have no intention to injure the Apothecaries in their proper Calling, if they will keep them&s;elves to that, will make good Medicins, and be content with moderate gains.</P>
<P>But 3. the Principal rea&s;on is, that Medicins are given out from the Di&s;pen|&s;aries by Servants, who are (generally) directed what to take for every Medi|cin, by him that pre&s;cribes it. And it might be very prejudical as well to Pa|tients, as to the Sub&s;cribers them&s;elves, if the Servants might &s;ell out what they pleas'd without order, and might take of the Patient what they pleas'd for it. For they would be under a great temptation to &s;ell things and either never bring them to account at all; or to take more of the Patient then the &s;tated price, and to put the Overplus into their own Pockets. And therefore how inconvenient &s;oever it may &s;eem to &s;uch as would be their own Doctors, not to have from the Di&s;pen&s;aries what they think would do them good, the Sub&s;cribers can by no means, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, recede from their e&s;tabli&s;h'd method in this Particular.</P>
