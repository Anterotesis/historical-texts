<HEAD>INTRODUCTORY PREFACE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> in particular who honoured <HI>DR. SMITH</HI> by their obliging Conde&s;cen&s;ion in attending his <HI>Lectures</HI> on the <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ic</HI>&mdash;and to the <HI>Public</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD be much wanting in re&s;pect, much more &s;o in gratitude, did I not in this addre&s;s acknowledge the plea&s;ing remembrance of that very candid reception, with which my noble and truly liberal auditors have been plea&s;ed to honour &s;ome very imperfect endeavours to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the fir&s;t elements of Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of the many inaccuracies to be di&s;covered throughout the Cour&s;e of my Lectures, I have not pre&s;umed to &s;tile them more than rude preparatory outlines; con|cluding there was little more to be expected than <HI>perhaps</HI> an approbation of the de&s;ign; and for this I tru&s;ted to the known indulgence of liberal minds. In the&s;e expectations
<PB N="6" REF="4">I have been agreeably deceived: &mdash; I have been mo&s;t kindly &s;upported by the favour and countenance of men di&s;|tingui&s;hed for abilities and learning: which emboldens me to hope the pre&s;ent enlargement of my Syllabus may likewi&s;e e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of the Public.&mdash;In my Introductory Lec|ture I mentioned that the de&s;ign had been many years in contemplation; but, fearful of my own want of importance, awed by the formidable appearance of the ta&s;k, and the al|mo&s;t infurmountable difficulties attending the promulging a new doctrine, with &s;uch a degree of &s;ucce&s;s as might in|title it to a fair and candid di&s;qui&s;ition,&mdash;I could not before &s;ummon the fortitude nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to the Public.</P>
<P>WHEN the Lectures were compiled, many doubts remained concerning the propriety of delivering the Conjectures on Animal Life; and had it not been for the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome friends, who&s;e judgments I have ever re&s;pected, the Conjectures had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: they ob&s;erved, and with propriety, my Lectures would be imperfect, unle&s;s the Prin|ciples were communicated on which my own maxims were founded.</P>
<P>To their determination I &s;ubmitted, not without reluc|tance, being fearful of the event; le&s;t I &s;hould either have been deceived in my rea&s;onings, or might not be able to expre&s;s my&s;elf, &s;o as to be clearly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IT is even now my mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, the Principles on which the Conjectures are founded &s;hould be coolly and deli|berately enquired into. Many of the opinions are undoubt|edly
<PB N="7" REF="5">new and &s;ingular: Truth being the great object of my pur&s;uit, I &s;hould have rea&s;on to lament the partiality of my friends, if I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be prevailed on to propagate errors, however plau&s;ible they might appear: For the&s;e rea|&s;ons I have with&s;tood many re&s;pectable applications to deliver another Cour&s;e of Lectures; and am determined not to repeat them, till the Public have had a fair opportunity of examining the truth of the Principles, on which tho&s;e Con|jectures are founded, that &s;upport the practical ob&s;ervations delivered in the Lectures.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that all learned and wi&s;e men ever re|gard new &s;y&s;tems with a jealous eye; and their &s;o doing is to be accounted a mark of wi&s;dom. I wi&s;h my principles to be received with a manly di&s;tru&s;t; &s;uffer them, however, to undergo a full and candid examination. I am &s;en&s;ible it will require &s;ome degree of attention for gentlemen to comprehend the whole of them; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have not &s;een the experiments, and who are unacquainted with the rea&s;onings by which the principles have been &s;upported.</P>
<P>THESE difficulties may perhaps occa&s;ion doubts in the minds of &s;ome medical, and other learned men; &s;o far it mu&s;t be acknowledged they will operate again&s;t me. I am content it &s;hould be &s;o. Po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e doubts may excite &s;ome more able per&s;ons to &s;earch after the truth; and, as I am not wedded to my own opinions, I &s;hall mo&s;t readily join in their condemnation, whenever they are proved to be erroneous.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>THE enlargement of my Syllabus will, I apprehend, prove acceptable to many of tho&s;e Gentlemen who honoured my Lectures by their pre&s;ence; &s;ome of them indeeed have applied to me on this &s;ubject. The Public at large, per|haps, may be plea&s;ed with having an opportunity of know|ing the principles; and generous minds ever &s;hew favour to an attempt, however poorly executed, that has for its ob|jects the information and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>I SHALL beg leave to repeat what was delivered in one of my Lectures&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>"I LOVE the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic. I honour able medical practitioners. I wi&s;h to convince mankind of the benefits that may be derived from a practice of phy&s;ic founded on liberal and rational principles. I have u&s;ed my be&s;t en|deavours to convey clear and adequate ideas concerning animal life, and the laws of the animal oeconomy; with a full hope and firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that thereby the practice of phy&s;ic may be rendered more univer&s;ally beneficial; and with a &s;incere de&s;ire that farther dignity may be added to the profe&s;&s;ion."</Q></P>
<P>WHETHER my maxims be true or fal&s;e, permit me to add, if I cannot, by a generous and candid behaviour on my own part, &s;uppre&s;s the envy and jealou&s;y of illiberal minds,&mdash;I can pity and forgive &s;uch men.</P>
<P>IT is my earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote medical knowledge; to render the philo&s;ophy of phy&s;ic, an ea&s;y, plea&s;ing, and
<PB N="9" REF="7">rational &s;tudy; and to point out to gentlemen of fortune the propriety of their becoming acquainted with the fir&s;t elements of a &s;cience&mdash;founded in the knowledge of the Laws of Nature, re&s;pecting animal life.</P>
<P>I MOST &s;incerely wi&s;h my fellow labourers, in the healing art, may with unanimity join me in this undertaking&mdash;let us endeavour to convince mankind it is their intere&s;t, on all occa&s;ions, to apply to able medical practitioners&mdash;more e&s;pe|cially in that cla&s;s of complaints termed <HI>Chronic,</HI> which is at pre&s;ent the great field of quackery.</P>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHICAL LECTURES ON THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC: By <HI>HUGH SMITH,</HI> M. D. Of HATTON-STREET, LONDON.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Lectures are intended to render the Practice of Phy&s;ic a liberal &s;cience; as derived from the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of Natural Philo&s;ophy&mdash;to open a new theory, adapted to practice, and corre&s;pon|dent to tho&s;e laws.</P>
<P>No per&s;on, it is believed, on this plan, has ever yet at|tempted to bring the rudiments of the &s;cience of Medicine, into one general and compendious point of view.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<P>IN the execution of the plan, <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> &s;ome practical rules may ari&s;e, &s;upported on e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, tending to the improvement of the &s;cience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to matters of fact evident to the &s;en&s;es &s;et forth in the Fourth Lecture&mdash;ON NUTRITION.</NOTE>. By a chain of rational and philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning it is de&s;igned to call forth that knowledge obtained by detached &s;tudies; and to apply it to the great end and purpo&s;e for which tho&s;e &s;tudies were in&s;ti|tuted.</P>
<P>MEN are often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers and talents, to which they them&s;elves, in &s;ome degree, are &s;trangers&mdash;and great abilities are often buried in oblivion, for want of right rules in practice. The truth of this ob&s;ervation many medical men have the mortification to experience; and on this ac|count <HI>only</HI> perhaps they pa&s;s their lives in ob&s;curity; and their knowledge is lo&s;t to the world. <HI>The pre&s;ent Lectures, therefore, are particularly recommended to medical &s;tudents.</HI></P>
<P>To men of letters human nature is acknowledged to be an agreeable object of contemplation. Can it be le&s;s entertaining to any man of good natural under&s;tanding? The knowledge of NATURE is not <HI>&s;urely</HI> above the reach of common &s;en&s;e &mdash; Con&s;idered liberally, and freed from all unnece&s;&s;ary terms of art, it will be found a plea&s;ing &s;cience. The&s;e Lectures, probably, may throw a new light on the &s;ubject; by open|ing to familiar view the fir&s;t &s;prings of life;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader may now perceive this pa&s;&s;age alludes to the Conjectures on Animal Life.</NOTE> the cau&s;es of
<PB N="15" REF="12">man's gradual ri&s;e; nece&s;&s;ary decay; and the cau&s;es likewi&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es to which he is liable. Is not every human being intere&s;ted in this inquiry? How many men have been rendered mi&s;erable by dipping into medical authors, for want of a con&s;i&s;tent view of the leading prin|ciples of the &s;cience? In the&s;e Lectures, though on medical &s;ubjects, every thing my&s;terious being removed, <HI>man</HI> properly becomes the object of rational, or philo&s;ophical contempla|tion.&mdash;It is to be hoped, likewi&s;e, the practice of phy&s;ic may be rendered more univer&s;ally beneficial, and <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> fre&s;h dignity may be added to the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>FIRST LECTURE&mdash;Introductory.&mdash;The Importance of the De&s;ign&mdash;not confined to men of the profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;but of utility to all gentlemen of liberal education&mdash;the propriety of their becoming acquainted with the elements of the &s;cience of Medicine enforced.</P>
<P>SECOND LECTURE&mdash;Hi&s;torical,&mdash;but <HI>principally</HI> in regard to the Practice of Phy&s;ic.&mdash;It is not only u&s;ual, but u&s;eful and entertaining, to trace the origin of whatever engages our inquiry.</P>
<P>THIRD LECTURE&mdash;On Animal Life.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h the Practice of Phy&s;ic, on liberal and rational prin|ciples,
<PB N="16" REF="13">without clear and fixed ideas concerning Animal Life&mdash;the great de&s;ign of the art being to a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature, in order to pre&s;erve the lives of Animals.</P>
<P>FOURTH LECTURE&mdash;On Nutrition.&mdash;The de&s;ign of this Lecture is to inquire into the mode of Nutrition, as it is performed in animal bodies&mdash;to point out certain facts, as <HI>data,</HI> to prove that Nutrition is univer&s;ally carried on, in animal bodies, by the glandular &s;y&s;tem.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For an explanation of the word Gland, &s;ee page 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>FIFTH LECTURE&mdash;The &s;ubject of Nutrition continued.&mdash;This doctrine, though perhaps allowed, in <HI>part,</HI> by many able practitioners, has never yet been proved in the <HI>whole</HI>&mdash;its novelty <HI>therefore</HI> might induce &s;ome to di&s;pute the truth of it, if the matter of fact re&s;ted <HI>only</HI> on a &s;ingle per&s;on's prac|tical di&s;coveries; or on a few &s;imple facts, <HI>however evident</HI> to the &s;en&s;es.&mdash;We &s;hall therefore confirm this doctrine by phy|&s;iological re&s;earches, and mathematical rea&s;onings founded on the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>data</HI> contained in the Fourth Lecture.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I do not wi&s;h to be under&s;tood, nor do I mean, &s;trict mathematical demon|&s;tration, for that can admit of no doubt; but a clo&s;e method of rea&s;oning, in imitation of that u&s;ed by mathematicians; which, in &s;ubjects not &s;trictly mathe|matical, never amounts to more than the highe&s;t degree of probability.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIXTH LECTURE&mdash;A continuation of the &s;ame &s;ubject.&mdash;No proof ought to be withheld, that can rationally be ad|vanced, in &s;upport of principles in them&s;elves important, but not generally e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;We &s;hall therefore, by mechanical
<PB N="17" REF="14" MS="y">rea&s;oning, farther confirm this doctrine of Nutrition being univer&s;ally carried on by the glandular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>SEVENTH LECTURE&mdash;On Di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;Here we mean to prove, agreeable to the principles before-mentioned, from practical experience, that the primary errors in animal bodies, which may ju&s;tly be &s;tyled the <HI>internal, incipient,</HI> cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, are, <HI>univer&s;ally,</HI> &s;eated in the glandular &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;this, if well &s;upported, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily e&s;tabli&s;h our doctrine concerning Nutrition beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt.&mdash;It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be productive of new theories in many ca&s;es; and alter the pre&s;ent mode of practice, with regard to the curative intentions, in various di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>EIGHTH LECTURE &mdash; How a Phy&s;ician differs from a Quack.&mdash;Having in the former Lecture e&s;tabli&s;hed fixed principles, as a &s;olid foundation for a liberal and rational practice of Phy&s;ic, the pre&s;ent philo&s;ophic inquiry &s;eems properly to take place.</P>
<P>NINTH LECTURE&mdash;Will &s;et forth the &s;uperiority of a ra|tional Practice of Phy&s;ic over empirici&s;m and quackery.</P>
<P>TENTH LECTURE&mdash;Acute and Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.&mdash;In this Lecture we &s;hall take the liberty of drawing the line of di&s;tinction, in &s;ome mea&s;ure different from that already given by medical writers; but <HI>perhaps</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the Practice of Phy&s;ic, on liberal and rational principles&mdash;which regularly leads to&mdash;</P>
<PB N="18" REF="15">
<P>ELEVENTH LECTURE&mdash;An inquiry into the cau&s;es of Quackery.</P>
<P>TWELFTH AND LAST LECTURE&mdash;Contains &s;ome rules, that we humbly conceive will be found u&s;eful; e&s;pecially, to younger practitioners, in their conduct towards patients, both in acute and chronic di&s;ea&s;es; in order to obtain their rational confidence, and to convince them of the benefits that may be derived from a Practice of Phy&s;ic, founded on liberal and rational principles.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A GLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THAT no confu&s;ion may ari&s;e in our ideas, and with a view to be clearly under&s;tood by every one into who&s;e hands this Syllabus may fall, it will not be improper to &s;ubjoin an explanation of the word GLAND, as it is applied in the Lectures.</P>
<P>ALL medical writers agree in this point, that a GLAND <HI>&s;erves to &s;eparate a particular humour from the blood.</HI> GLANDS are di&s;tingui&s;hed, by anatomi&s;ts, into &s;imple and compound; accurate de&s;criptions have been given of many that are vi&s;ible, and new GLANDS are continually di&s;covered. It concerns not our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to inquire into their &s;tructures: Different GLANDS are evidently appointed for different u&s;es&mdash;Whether, therefore, they be &s;imple or com|pound; or whether they be any thing more than the ulti|mate terminations of &s;ingle arteries, convoluted, or not;
<PB N="20" REF="17">every part of the animal oeconomy mu&s;t be allowed to be a GLAND, who&s;e office it is to <HI>&s;eparate, percolate,</HI> or <HI>drain</HI> a particular humour from the blood; which humour, when thus &s;eparated, is no longer blood.</P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE CONJECTURES ON ANIMAL LIFE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THROUGHOUT the cour&s;e of our Lectures, we endeavoured from effects to lead to cau&s;es&mdash;and thereby to account for Nutrition&mdash;and the primary cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>OUR Conjectures concerning the fir&s;t active material cau&s;e of Animal Life, and the laws of the Animal Oeconomy, for obvious rea&s;ons, were totally detached from the Lec|tures&mdash;on the&s;e points, we endeavoured to trace effects from cau&s;es; and, by arguments founded on experimental proofs, we hope at lea&s;t to have &s;trengthened &s;ome of the opinions delivered in our Lectures; though perhaps we have not been able fully to e&s;tabli&s;h any point contended for.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="19">
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary, however, to be remarked, that nothing new is meant to be advanced concerning the properties of air, nor is it intended to enter into its properties at large&mdash;the application of its properties to Animal Life, is all we aim at: Some Conjectures are offered, that &s;eem to &s;hew the probability of air, put into motion by heat, being not only the fir&s;t active material cau&s;e of new life, but the actual &s;upport of life, throughout every different &s;tage of our animated exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THESE Conjectures, if admitted, &s;hew the Mo&s;aic account of the creation of man to be philo&s;ophically true&mdash;<Q><HI>that the Lord God formed man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life, and man became a living &s;oul,"</HI> <BIBL>(Gen. ch. ii. v. 7.)</BIBL></Q>&mdash;and that the laws of generation are the means appointed by our Creator to pre|&s;erve this active operative cau&s;e of life, &s;o given: For the Conjectures &s;eem to evince what we term VITAL AIR, to be the fir&s;t cau&s;e of motion, not only in man, but throughout the whole animated creation.</P>
<P>OUR leading aphori&s;m runs thus&mdash;</P>
<P>IN ALL ANIMALS, LIFE, HEAT, AND MOTION, ARE INSEPARABLE.</P>
<P>WE maintained the truth of this aphori&s;m, not only by death and its con&s;equences, but likewi&s;e by life and its effects: It &s;eems al&s;o to be farther illu&s;trated by the follow|ing Principles&mdash;from which many other important con|clu&s;ions have been drawn.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE CONJECTURES ARE FOUNDED.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Each Night, before the Lecture, a variety of Experiments were exhibited, to demon&s;trate the Truth of the following Principles: many of which will not be denied by &s;cientific Men; and where it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, the others are attempted to be explained.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. AIR is matter.</P>
<P N="2">II. MATTER is of it&s;elf inactive, but capable of being put into motion.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="21">
<P N="3">III. AIR, as matter, is capable of different arrangements, modifications, and combinations, in obedience to the ge|neral laws of matter.</P>
<P N="4">IV. AIR is a fluid&mdash;but has properties peculiar to it&s;elf, and different from other fluids;&mdash;for,</P>
<P N="5">V. AIR is an ela&s;tic fluid, and the force of its &s;pring is pro|portionable to its weight.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AIR po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property of rarefaction, or expan&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. HEAT&mdash;by which we mean a &s;imilar effect to that pro|duced by fire, will rarefy or expand air.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="22">
<P N="8">VIII. AIR po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property of compre&s;&s;ion, or conden&s;ation.</P>
<P N="9">IX. EXTERNAL pre&s;&s;ure will conden&s;e, or compre&s;s air.</P>
<P N="10">X. COLD will conden&s;e, or compre&s;s air.</P>
<P N="11">XI. AIR <HI>then</HI> is rarefied by heat, and compre&s;&s;ed by cold.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>AIR exi&s;ts in all bodies, fluid and &s;olid.</HI></P>
<P>This, perhaps, will not be doubted by &s;uch as are acquainted with experiments on air&mdash;for the &s;atisfaction of others, the truth of the Principle was proved by experiments on gold, &s;ilver, copper, bra&s;s, lead, marble, various other &s;tones, wood, &amp;c. Air vi&s;ibly i&s;&s;ued from them all; more from &s;ome, than from others, in proportion to their poro&s;ity&mdash;the poro&s;ity of
<PB N="26" REF="23">wood, &s;tone and metals, by help of a micro&s;cope, may be curi|ou&s;ly di&s;played to the eye.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. <HI>WHEN bodies are deprived of internal heat and motion, the air contained within them may be &s;aid to be at a &s;tate of re&s;t; it being then only &s;ubject to the variations of the atmo&s;phere.</HI></P>
<P>This may be proved by the Thermometer. The following curious experiment farther illu&s;trates the matter of fact, and may lead to other di&s;coveries: Let the bulb of a Thermometer be put into two ounces of cold water; the air, apparently at re&s;t in the quick&s;ilver, by the effect of cold being more compre&s;&s;ed, the mercury will quickly de&s;cend &s;everal degrees; when the quick&s;ilver is again apparently at re&s;t, let thirty drops of oil of vitriol be put into the water; this produces heat, and the air contained in the quick&s;ilver will as quickly be expanded; by the effect of this internal heat communicated to the fluid, the quick&s;ilver will ri&s;e two or three degrees: Let a little chalk be now added to the fluid, the internal heat will be farther in|crea&s;ed, and the quick&s;ilver will a&s;cend two or three degrees more. &mdash; Does not this experiment likewi&s;e &s;hew that heat accompanies internal motion in fluids? &mdash; This ob&s;ervation, perhaps, may not prove unworthy the attention of &s;uch Gentle|men as entertain them&s;elves with experiments on what is termed <HI>fixed air.</HI></P>
<PB N="27" REF="24">
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>ON the application of heat to a fluid, the fir&s;t evident &s;ign of internal motion is an air-bubble.</HI></P>
<P>This is experimentally &s;hewn, by putting any tran&s;parent liquor into a &s;poon, and placing it over a candle, or a lamp; in dif|ferent fluids, different appearances may be ob&s;erved, not un|worthy the attention of the curious.</P>
<P N="15">XV. IN this &s;tate of the fluid the air contained in it is more rarefied, and expanded, than in the cold &s;tate of the fluid.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. THE air contained in mo&s;t fluids becomes &s;o far rarefied as to be put into motion by a degree of heat below that of the blood; we may then fairly conclude, from the degree of heat accompanying animal life, that the air contained in the fluids of an animal body is continually in motion.</P>
<P><HI>This was confirmed by a variety of experiments (oleaginous fluids excepted) by placing the fluids over a lamp, and regu|lating the heat by a Thermometer.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="25">
<P N="17">XVII. THE tunic, or coat of every di&s;tinct air-bubble, is evi|dently formed of the &s;urrounding fluid.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. EACH di&s;tinct bubble of air has a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate motion.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. IN different fluids, different degrees of heat are required to render the&s;e air-bubbles vi&s;ibly active.</P>
<P N="20">XX. <HI>IN the more thin and tran&s;parent fluids, air-bubbles are &s;ooner vi&s;ible; and the air becomes fugitive below the de|gree of blood heat.</HI></P>
<P>Water acidulated with &s;pirit of vitriol, or di&s;tilled vinegar, becomes more tran&s;parent, and will prove the truth of this Principle; it may likewi&s;e be &s;hewn by many of the white wines, and other fluids.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="26">
<P N="21">XXI. THESE bubbles of air, being &s;pecifically lighter than the &s;urrounding fluid, naturally tend to the &s;urface; and there, <HI>&s;oon bur&s;ting,</HI> this rarefied air e&s;capes, and mixes with the common atmo&s;phere, unle&s;s it be prevented by proper reci|pients.</P>
<P><HI>Since the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere is the &s;ame on all fluids, how happens it that in &s;ome the air-bubbles are longer detained than in others?</HI></P>
<P N="22">XXII. DIFFERENT fluids po&s;&s;e&s;s different degrees of tenacity or cohe&s;ion: this tenacity is weaker in thin tran&s;parent fluids.&mdash;<HI>Air-bubbles, therefore, become &s;ooner fugitive in &s;uch fluids.</HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. <HI>GLUE, gum, or &s;ugar, &s;u&s;pended in fluids, render them more tenacious, or cohe&s;ive.&mdash;AIR-BUBBLES THEREFORE ARE LONGER RESTRAINED FROM BECOMING FUGITIVE IN SUCH FLUIDS.</HI></P>
<P>If our conjectures prove right, this ob&s;ervation may afford a clew to examine into the laws of life in the vegetable king|dom.&mdash;This idea is thrown out for the con&s;ideration of ingenious men; the &s;ubject it&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, not being within our &s;phere.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="27">
<P N="24">XXIV. EXTERNAL heat being removed from a fluid, although the pre&s;&s;ure of the cold atmo&s;phere be freely admitted; it is, neverthele&s;s, a con&s;iderable time before the air, rarefied by heat, returns to a &s;tate of re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The truth of this principle may be illu&s;trated by a &s;poon, in the manner before mentioned;</HI> (Principle XIV.) <HI>and it is worthy attention.</HI></P>
<P N="25">XXV. <HI>EARTHY particles may be &s;u&s;pended in a tran&s;parent fluid.</HI></P>
<P>The proce&s;s for making magne&s;ia alba proves this&mdash;it is no contemptible experiment, though in familiar practice.</P>
<P>Two tran&s;parent liquors being mixed, they in&s;tantly lo&s;e both their tran&s;parency and fluidity, and become one intire white in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;this being repeatedly wa&s;hed with water, the white earth, when dried, is the common magne&s;ia alba of the &s;hops.</P>
<P>It is well known this white earth was originally &s;u&s;pended in an aqueous men&s;truum, by means of the vitriolic acid; and in this proce&s;s, it is precipitated by the fixed alkaline.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="28">
<P N="26">XXVI. <HI>EARTHY particles may float in air.</HI></P>
<P>If any one doubts the truth of this, let him admit a ray of light into a darkened room, and he will be convinced of the matter of fact.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. <HI>AIR does exi&s;t in the circulating fluids of an animal.</HI></P>
<P>This was proved by the blood ve&s;&s;el of a bullock, being &s;ecured by ligatures, before it was &s;eparated from the body of the living animal&mdash;it was farther confirmed by live cray|fi&s;h, tench, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. <HI>AIR does exi&s;t in the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain.</HI></P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t beautiful experiments that can be exhibited by the air-pump&mdash;if it be well &s;hewn, the re&s;i&s;tance of the medullary and cortical &s;ub&s;tance of the brain is &s;o great, as to produce a kind of perpetual motion.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. AIR-BUBBLES, though &s;pecifically lighter than the &s;ur|rounding fluid, cannot e&s;cape till the re&s;i&s;tance ari&s;ing from the cohe&s;ion of the parts of the &s;urrounding fluid it&s;elf be overcome.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="29">
<P N="30">XXX. THIS re&s;i&s;tance, ari&s;ing from the cohe&s;ion of the parts of the fluid, is proportioned to the different degrees of tenacity proper to different fluids; as before &s;hewn.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. THIS cohe&s;ive property in fluids, <HI>then,</HI> is the bond that re&s;trains the air from becoming fugitive; or, in other words, <HI>it is the bond of union.</HI></P>
<P N="32">XXXII. ANIMAL jelly, or gluten, expo&s;ed to the common atmo|&s;phere, and &s;urrounding a globule of air, is &s;ufficiently co|he&s;ive to prevent this moving air e&s;caping in a degree of heat &s;omewhat &s;uperior to that of blood heat.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. IT being highly nece&s;&s;ary to fix &s;ome &s;tandard to regulate our inquiries&mdash;Air rarefied, in motion, detained in animal bodies by glandular &s;ecretions, or circulating with the fluids in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, permit us to call VITAL AIR.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. VITAL Air, Heat, and Motion, then, appear to be in&s;e|parable, in animal life.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="30">
<P>ON the&s;e principles our arguments are founded, concern|ing the fir&s;t active material cau&s;e of animal life; and from the&s;e principles our conjectures are drawn, concerning the laws of generation, and tho&s;e of the animal oeconomy. For the &s;atisfaction of the learned, and curious, it will not be improper to add a few words concerning VITAL AIR, which we pre&s;ume to be the fir&s;t <HI>material</HI> cau&s;e of motion in animal life.</P>
<P>THIS conjecture we have endeavoured to &s;upport by argu|ments drawn from experiments; all tending to &s;hew the ra|tional probability of air exi&s;ting in an active and circulating &s;tate in animal bodies.</P>
<P>IT will be remembered, we proved air did actually exi&s;t in the blood of a living animal; and likewi&s;e in the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain. We al&s;o proved, that in the degree of heat proper to animal life, this air mu&s;t be in a rarefied and active &s;tate; and we farther endeavoured to &s;hew, by arguments drawn from an incubated egg, and other points, the rational probability, that the propelling force of air, thus rarefied, and confined in a va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, was the fir&s;t ma|terial cau&s;e of the circulation of the blood, and other fluids, in an animal body.</P>
<P>THE reaction of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem we pre&s;ume to be the &s;econdary cau&s;e, in conjunction with the former, producing what is termed <HI>involuntary mu&s;cular motion</HI>&mdash;this motion, in the beginning of new life, is fir&s;t di&s;coverable at the <HI>punctum &s;aliens,</HI> or leaping point; which afterwards becomes the heart of the foetus. The heart we have pre&s;umed to &s;tile
<PB N="34" REF="31">the <HI>centre of motion;</HI> by which the circulation of the blood is regulated and maintained. The blood we con&s;ider to be a pa&s;&s;ive fluid, the common men&s;truum from whence nutrition is derived, by means of the glands.&mdash;We pre&s;ume that &s;ome one order or more of the glands mu&s;t be injured, debilitated, or totally ob&s;tructed, before the blood of an animal becomes impure.</P>
<P>BY the propelling force of VITAL AIR we pre&s;ume all glandular &s;ecretions to be performed, and the lymphatic cir|culations to be &s;upported by the &s;ame power&mdash;and by means of the glands we pre&s;ume the laws of generation to be main|tained.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of new life, the motion of Vital Air &s;eems to be &s;upported by the natural heat of the parent, or by &s;ome adequate external means&mdash;this appears to be a general law, throughout nature, till <HI>involuntary mu&s;cular motion</HI> be|comes &s;ufficiently powerful to communicate that degree of internal heat, peculiarly proper to Vital Air: When this period arrives, the act of incubation cea&s;es, with all oviparous animals; the foetus opening to it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age in order to breathe the common atmo&s;phere; and, in viviparous animals, the natural birth takes place, by the united efforts of the parent and foetus.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be expected that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid concerning the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;In this &s;ummary way I cannot hope to per&s;uade &s;cientific men to think with me&mdash;however, by mentioning the points contended for,
<PB N="35" REF="32">po&s;&s;ibly objections will be &s;tarted, that eventually may lead to the di&s;covery of truth.</P>
<P>WE took notice in &s;ome of our conjectures, that man having a material body, it was but rea&s;onable to conclude it &s;hould an&s;wer the various purpo&s;es for which it was &s;o cu|riou&s;ly formed; and that every di&s;tinct member &s;hould have its de&s;tined office. We endeavoured to prove that, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of motion and &s;en&s;ation, the nerves, proceeding from the brain and &s;pinal marrow, though the chief, were not the only in&s;truments; and from numerous experimental proofs, we concluded that the reaction of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, voluntary motion, and the exerci&s;e of the external &s;en&s;es, could not be &s;upported without the aid of the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IT will be recollected we u&s;ed many arguments to &s;hew the <HI>proper &s;en&s;e of feeling</HI> &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the due re|&s;i&s;tance of the medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain, or nervous matter, oppo&s;ed to the propelling force of Vital Air.</P>
<P>WE took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that all the other &s;en&s;es were obedient to the <HI>proper &s;en&s;e of feeling;</HI> and endeavoured to &s;hew that hearing, &s;eeing, &s;melling, and ta&s;ting, were nothing more than the effects ari&s;ing from feeling, which we con&s;idered as their primary cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As we have, under certain limitations, acknowledged the nervous &s;y&s;tem to be the &s;eat of feeling, we inquired into the effects produced by any con&s;iderable variation in the
<PB N="36" REF="33">Vital Air, peculiarly exi&s;ting in the nervous matter&mdash;and having before &s;hewn the rational probability of <HI>pain</HI> ari&s;ing from the propelling force of too highly rarefied air, we &s;eemed to be warranted in drawing the following conclu|&s;ions:&mdash;The &s;en&s;e of feeling is &s;eated in the nervous &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the &s;en&s;e of feeling becoming too exqui&s;ite produces pain&mdash;the nervous &s;y&s;tem is <HI>then</HI> the &s;eat of pain.&mdash;Gouty &s;ymptoms, therefore, whether fixed or wandering, being ever accompanied with that too exqui&s;ite degree of &s;en&s;ibi|lity, that either produces unhappy &s;en&s;ations, or acute pain, we pre&s;ume the nervous &s;y&s;tem to be principally affected in gouty patients.</P>
<P>WE endeavoured to &s;trengthen, and &s;upport our conjectures concerning gouty, and what are termed nervous complaints, not only from practical experience; but likewi&s;e by &s;hewing that a partial, or total lo&s;s of motion and feeling, in para|lytic complaints and nervous apoplexies, probably ari&s;es from an oppo&s;ite cau&s;e&mdash;namely, from the propelling force of Vital Air exi&s;ting in the nervous matter, or in the me|dullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain, being too much abated; or from its becoming a body at re&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the practical inferences, ari&s;ing from our conjectures, concerning the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem: happy &s;hall I think my&s;elf if they prove any way in&s;tru|mental towards alleviating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the &s;entient principle, or &s;pirit of man, we ob&s;erved, that although &s;imple ideas might be &s;tirred up
<PB N="37" REF="34">in the mind by the mediation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem; yet, <HI>our ideas are not matter:</HI> &s;omething more than a material &s;y&s;tem, therefore, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary and requi&s;ite to thinking. And if VITAL AIR be the fir&s;t material cau&s;e of motion, the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem can be con&s;idered only as the &s;econdary cau&s;e:&mdash;Is it not highly improbable, then, that the &s;entient principle &s;hould depend on this &s;econdary cau&s;e, <HI>namely,</HI> on a &s;y&s;tem of organized matter?&mdash;Be this as it may, it is out of my province to enter into metaphy&s;ical controver&s;ies; and, as ob&s;erved in my Lectures, I am unequal to the ta&s;k: How|ever, that the &s;entient principle is not material, we verily believe, and endeavoured to confirm by many other argu|ments;&mdash;and if the mind be not material, experimental re&s;earches after this <HI>immaterial principle</HI> mu&s;t ever prove in vain.</P>
<P>WE ventured to add, that if there be a connection be|tween gro&s;s material, and immaterial &s;ub&s;tances, it is pro|bably effected by &s;ome <HI>rare medium;</HI> and therefore, that this union was not unlikely to be formed by means of VITAL AIR. Whether our general arguments on this point were forcible or not, mu&s;t be left to the determination of others; we however concluded this &s;ubject in the following manner.</P>
<P>WE have endeavoured to &s;hew that life depends on VITAL AIR; and that not only motion, but all the external &s;en&s;es depend on it likewi&s;e&mdash;and if &s;o, it &s;eems a fair conclu&s;ion, that the nervous fluid, or animal &s;pirits, is nothing more than VITAL AIR.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="35">
<P>I AM compelled, from my practical experience in the gout, in paralytic complaints, and other errors in the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem, to believe this&mdash;and from what has been ad|vanced, am I not authori&s;ed to conclude, the Mo&s;aic accounts of the creation of man, and of the laws of generation, are philo&s;ophically true?</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;et forth what may probably be deemed &s;ufficient to enable medical and other &s;cientific men to judge of the rationality of our &s;y&s;tem&mdash;I leave it to their con&s;ideration, whether we mean to captivate the credulous, or to appeal to men of &s;en&s;e in pur&s;uit of truth.</P>
<P>SUCH gentlemen as have honoured me by their attention, will be enabled, from the&s;e outlines, to recall many of our conjectures concerning animal life, and the laws of the ani|mal oeconomy; which, I flatter my&s;elf, will afford them &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I DO not expect this &s;y&s;tem, even if it &s;hould prove to be true, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed without oppo&s;ition; I am prepared to receive all objections that may be advanced, whether it be in my power to an&s;wer them or not&mdash;I am prepared to re|ceive them, let me repeat, becau&s;e I wi&s;h the principles to pa&s;s through the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>IF the principles be admitted, it is pre&s;umed the rationa|lity of the conjectures, on animal life, will add no little degree of weight to the doctrines contended for in the cour&s;e of our Lectures; <HI>namely,</HI> that nutrition is carried on by means of
<PB N="39" REF="36">the glandular &s;y&s;tem; and that the internal, incipient cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es are <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> &s;eated in the glands.</P>
<P>IT is proper, <HI>however,</HI> to ob&s;erve, whether the principles be admitted, and our conjectures allowed, or not; it does not follow, that our practical inferences, re&s;pecting di&s;ea&s;es, originally drawn from matters of fact evident to the &s;en&s;es, are to be con&s;idered as altogether erroneous.&mdash;All that I a&s;k, is, to be judged with candour; and mo&s;t chearfully &s;ubmit to the determination of intelligent men.</P>
<P>I AM fully per&s;uaded, tho&s;e gentlemen who did me the honour of attending my Lectures, will not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that my opinions were delivered with diffidence; it was my earne&s;t de&s;ire to per&s;uade; but well knowing the &s;canty limits of human under&s;tanding, I believe no man can chal|lenge me with having advanced any one conjecture as a po|&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion: Yet, <HI>this</HI> I did &s;ay, at the conclu&s;ion of my Lectures&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>"As a duty incumbent on me, I have, in this public manner, communicated my thoughts to liberal and learned men; that the world at large, however they may differ in opinion, might not charge me with having re&s;erved my <HI>principles</HI> as SECRETS: But having entered into &s;o very wide a field, I am certain, you, gentlemen, would not wi&s;h me too ha&s;tily to commit to the pre&s;s, the pre&s;ent crude and imperfect ideas, on &s;ubjects of &s;uch import|ance.&mdash;If the principles on which our opinions are founded, can be fairly overturned, by arguments drawn from expe|riments&mdash;<HI><PB N="40" REF="37">let them fall.</HI>&mdash;If not, I tru&s;t more able advo|cates than my&s;elf will not be wanting, to &s;upport the truth of our doctrines; and to enlarge the bounds of our knowledge, with regard to the theory, and cure of di&s;ea&s;es."</Q></P>
