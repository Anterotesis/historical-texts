<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF ARSACES, PRINCE OF BETLIS. BOOK THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>'THE lure of private advantage,' (re&s;umed the captive, the next evening, in the words of Himilco) <Q>which had been held up to the Byr&s;ans, to draw them into the war, had fired them with &s;uch an univer&s;al phrenzy, that their army might almo&s;t have been &s;aid to contain the whole nation. People of both &s;exes, of every age, and rank,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
crowded as to a fe&s;tival, in all the pomp and parade of affluence and luxury, to gratify curio&s;ity and &s;hare in the &s;poil; for &s;o confident were they of &s;ucce&s;s, that they even carried chains to bind their enemies, whom they already con&s;idered as captives.</Q></P>
<Q><P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to make the impa|tience of &s;uch a multitude &s;ubmit to the nece&s;&s;ary delays of di&s;cipline, or ob&s;erve military order, in their march again&s;t a foe, whom they de&s;pi&s;ed. They broke, like a deluge, into the country of the Coptes, who, having lived in the &s;ecu|rity of innocence and peace, were un|prepared to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch an attack, and ravaged it with all the wanton in&s;olence and cruelties of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>But though the Coptes were unable to face &s;uch numbers in the field, they lo&s;t not that courage with which hone&s;t in|dignation always fires a virtuous brea&s;t.
<PB N="3" REF="10">
They removed their families into places of pre&s;ent &s;afety, among the inacce&s;|&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of the mountains; and then dividing them&s;elves into &s;eparate bodies, kept out of the &s;ight of their ene|mies, till they &s;hould find an opportu|nity for attacking them with that ad|vantage which their manner of proceed|ing promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>This conduct, which &s;hould have put the Byr&s;ans on their guard, only made them more confident and &s;ecure. They attributed it to fear; and &s;preading them&s;elves over the country, as if they had no enemy to apprehend, &s;oon gave the Coptes that opportunity for which they watched; who falling upon them, from every quarter, at the &s;ame time, with the irre&s;i&s;tible fury of men animated by the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and fight|ing for all they held dear, overthrew them with &s;uch a &s;laughter, that &s;carcely
<PB N="4" REF="11">
enough e&s;caped to bear home the melan|choly tidings of their defeat.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the effects of this misfortune upon the minds of the Byr&s;ans. Their dejection now ex|ceeded their late confidence, and &s;hewed, in the &s;tronge&s;t light, the difference be|tween true fortitude, in&s;pired by virtue, and the vain pre&s;umption of arrogance; as their fate, &s;oon after, did that be|tween power, founded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of internal &s;trength, and the fal&s;e &s;em|blance of it, which is reflected by wealth and pre&s;ent pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Fo&s;tered in the lap of luxury, the wordy warriours, who&s;e valour had been &s;o loud in the council, who&s;e boa&s;ting had inflamed the multitude to madne&s;s, now &s;huddered at the apprehen&s;ion of having tho&s;e evils, which they had wan|tonly cau&s;ed to be inflicted on their unoffending neighbours, retorted on
<PB N="5" REF="12">
them&s;elves; and ba&s;ely fled behind their &s;overeign for &s;helter, leaving him to &s;truggle with the &s;torm, which they had rai&s;ed again&s;t his principles and opinion.</P>
<P>True noblene&s;s of &s;oul always &s;hines brighte&s;t in adver&s;ity. The voice of danger awoke the virtues of Amilcar, who then &s;at upon the throne of Nar|bal, and proved the blood of his illu&s;|trious race. He &s;ummoned the poor remains of his people, and without de|&s;cending to fruitle&s;s accu&s;ations, ordered to arms every one able to take the field, propo&s;ing to lead them directly again&s;t the enemy, if happily he might &s;urprize them in the &s;ecurity of their late victory; and by one brave effort, wipe off the di&s;honour they had &s;uffered.</P></Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<Q><P>PASSION, when broken loo&s;e from the rule of rea&s;on, is ever in extreams. Fear had now taken &s;uch ab&s;olute po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="6" REF="13">
of the Byr&s;ans, that they trem|bled at the very thought of a war, with tho&s;e whom they &s;o lately had de|&s;pi&s;ed; and &s;hutting their ears to the name of honour, by their infatuated cowardice, di&s;abled their &s;overeign from attempting to deliver them from the di&s;tre&s;s into which they had been plung|ed by their own ra&s;hne&s;s. Deaf to his exhortations, and in de&s;pite of his au|thority, they &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to beg for peace, in the mo&s;t abject terms; but they were now made to feel, in their turn, the in&s;olence of power.</P>
<P>The leaders of the Coptick nation, no longer thinking them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving any mea&s;ures with them, in order to confirm the confidence and &s;harpen the animo&s;ity of their own people, gave audience to the amba&s;&s;a|dors, in the pre&s;ence of the whole army; and having received their humiliations with contempt, replied to their &s;uppli|cations
<PB N="7" REF="14">
for peace, by aggravating every in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion which they had ever received from them; and enume|rating, for they admitted not of aggra|vation, all the cruelties and outrages which they had committed in their late inva&s;ion; concluding with declaring their re&s;olution to pur&s;ue to the la&s;t extre|mity a people, who&s;e pride and inju&s;tice had made them the general enemies of human-kind.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of their being rouzed by this menace, to that manly de&s;peration which often produces &s;afety, it only &s;unk them deeper in the mo&s;t de&s;picable weakne&s;s of fear. Each looked to the other for that coun&s;el, which he him&s;elf had neither pre&s;ence of mind to give, nor &s;pirit to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>They were utterly at a lo&s;s. Their own people were di&s;per&s;ed at too great a di&s;tance, in their colonies, to be col|lected
<PB N="8" REF="15">
in time for affording them relief; and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their former con|duct towards tho&s;e, whom nece&s;&s;ity had obliged to live in alliance with them, would not permit their placing any confidence in their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>However, as they had lo&s;t every other hope, they &s;ent to all the neighbouring nations to implore aid in their di&s;tre&s;s; but in vain.</P>
<P>They were an&s;wered with demands of redre&s;s for injuries offered in the day of their pro&s;perity; and which would never have been mentioned, had the power, which committed, remained to &s;upport them; and &s;aw the very people, to whom they had applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, prepare to join their enemies, in hope of &s;haring in the &s;poil of that wealth, which they had unhappily mi&s;taken for &s;trength; but now found to be only a lure to tempt ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">This aggravated their fears to di&s;trac|tion, and made them &s;till an ea&s;ier con|que&s;t to their enemies, who had now advanced into the bo&s;om of their coun|try, where they returned all the out|rages which had been exerci&s;ed upon them&s;elves before.</P>
<P>The wretched Byr&s;ans, unconnected by the ties of &s;ocial virtue, unin&s;pired with the &s;acred love of their country, and un&s;upported by the principles of religion, thought only of &s;hifting every one for him&s;elf, and flying with his darling wealth, (though he knew not whither to direct his flight, nor had time to provide the proper means for it) re|gardle&s;s of the commands, the entreaties of their &s;overeign, who, glowing with the virtues of his race, conjured them by every motive, ju&s;tly dear to man, to imitate his example, and die with honour; if they could not live with happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17">Animated by this divine principle, he put him&s;elf at the head of his own hou&s;hold, and di&s;daining to be at|tacked in a city, which he had not force to defend, met the enemy in the field, where he &s;ealed his love to his country with his blood, as became the de&s;cendant of Narbal.</P>
<P>Here let me drop the veil, nor put humanity to pain, by &s;triving to repre|&s;ent &s;cenes, in which the unavoidable horrors of war were rendered &s;till more horrible by per&s;onal animo&s;ity and re|venge.</P>
<P>Suffice it to &s;ay, that &s;uch of the wretched people as fell in the way of the conquerors in the fir&s;t heat of their fury, were put to the &s;word without re&s;pect to age or &s;ex; the city razed to the ground, and the name of Byr&s;a no longer numbered among nations.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">At the&s;e words grief choaked his ut|terance. He covered his face, for a few moments; and having paid the tribute of a pious tear to the memory of his coun|try, thus continued his narrative.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IT was my peculiar fate to be &s;pared the pain of beholding the&s;e &s;cenes of deva&s;tation and cruelty.</P>
<P>As I was riding one day, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Byr&s;an army, &s;oon after our entering the country of the Coptes, I &s;aw a town delightfully &s;itu|ated, at the entrance of a beautiful val|ley, wrapped in flames.</P>
<P>Too many &s;ights, of the &s;ame kind, making me at no lo&s;s for the cau&s;e of &s;uch a calamity, I ha&s;ted directly to the place, to put a &s;top to the out|rages of the &s;oldiers, and admini&s;ter
<PB N="12" REF="19">
what relief I could to the unhappy &s;ufferers, who were only &s;uch as age and infirmity had prevented from retiring with the re&s;t; and would have be&s;poken compa&s;&s;ion for, from every heart, not hardened again&s;t the feelings of hu|manity.</P>
<P>I flew from place to place, wherever the cries of di&s;tre&s;s call'd for my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. I commanded! I entreated! and where every other method failed, had recour&s;e to force to make the ravagers remember they were men.</P>
<P>As I was labouring thus, I met a party of the Byr&s;ans, dragging, by his grey hairs, an aged prie&s;t, while others goaded him on, with their &s;pears, to|ward a magnificent temple, which they had &s;et on fire, and de&s;igned to throw him into the flames.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="20">Struck with horror at the &s;ight, I ru&s;hed among the wor&s;e than brutal wretches, and &s;miting with my &s;word one of them, who refu&s;ed to obey my command, re&s;cued the trembling victim from their cruelty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had recovered a little from the &s;tupefaction of affright, he threw him&s;elf at my feet, and regarding me with a look of ineffable expre&s;&s;ion, the emotions of his heart depriving him of utterance, rai&s;ed his hands and eyes to heaven, to implore its ble&s;&s;ings on his deliverer.</P>
<P>Melting in &s;ympathy to his di&s;tre&s;s, I rai&s;ed him from the ground; and was going to &s;peak words of comfort to his grief, when a &s;udden &s;hout drew my attention to other objects.</P>
<P>I turned ha&s;tily; and &s;aw the Byr&s;ans flying on every &s;ide, before a body of the
<PB N="14" REF="21">
Coptes, who had poured from the neighbouring mountain, with the impe|tuo&s;ity of a torrent, and bore down every thing they met: I flew to oppo&s;e them; and &s;trove by my voice and actions to animate the Byr&s;ans, to a re&s;i&s;tance, which alone could procure their &s;afety.</P>
<P>But all my efforts were in vain. In|cumbered with &s;poil, and enfeebled by their own exce&s;&s;es, they fell ju&s;t and ea&s;y victims to the vengeance of their foes, who were exa&s;perated to &s;uch rage by their inhuman ravages, and cruelty, of which every object around pre&s;ented them with the mo&s;t horrid in&s;tances, that they &s;lew every Byr&s;an they met, many of them in the very act of im|ploring that mercy, which they had &s;o lately refu&s;ed to others.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who had immediately followed me, were too few to oppo&s;e &s;uch num|bers
<PB N="15" REF="22">
with &s;ucce&s;s: for in the fal&s;e &s;ecurity into which the retreat of the Coptes had betrayed us, I had wandered that morn|ing to take a view of the country, at|tended only by &s;ome of my own do|me&s;tics.</P>
<P>Attached by per&s;onal regard, no danger could make them de&s;ert me. But valour wa&s;tes it&s;elf it vain again&s;t unequal force. They all fell fighting faithfully around me, leaving me alone, and covered with wounds, in the mid&s;t of an ho&s;t of enemies, enraged to mad|ne&s;s, and breathing nothing but death.</P>
<P>But &s;till, the natural impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, prompted me to avert the &s;troke of fate, as long as I could; and I was animated by the de&s;ire of dying with honour, after I had lo&s;t every hope of &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="23">With this view, I collected all my &s;trength, and advanced to &s;mite one of the foremo&s;t of the Coptes, who pre&s;&s;ed upon me, as I &s;tood with my back to a pillar, to prevent my being &s;ur|rounded; but weakened by the lo&s;s of blood, which &s;treamed from every part of my body, my &s;word flew out of my hand, and I fell at my length upon the ground, de&s;titute of every power of further re&s;i&s;tance, or defence.</P>
<P>This thought doubled the horrors of a &s;ituation, from which there appeared no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape. I &s;aw the &s;word lifted to &s;trike, when in the mo|ment which divides life from death, the Coptic prie&s;t, whom I had ju&s;t be|fore &s;aved from the cruelty of the Byr|&s;ans, bur&s;t through the croud, and fear|le&s;s of the &s;words, which hung over my head, threw him&s;elf upon me, and covered my body with his own.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24">Re&s;pect to his &s;acred character and virtues in&s;tantly re&s;trained their rage; and procured me a &s;afety, of which I was long in&s;en&s;ible, having &s;wooned away, quite exhau&s;ted by my lo&s;s of blood, ju&s;t as the good man had en|folded me in his arms.</P></Q>

<Q><P>AT the return of rea&s;on, I found my&s;elf in a place to which I was a &s;tran|ger. My wounds and weakne&s;s &s;oon recalled to my memory, the &s;ituation in which I had lately been; but how I had e&s;caped, or where I now was, I could not form any conception.</P>
<P>While I was &s;triving to recollect my &s;cattered thoughts, the good prie&s;t en|tered the chamber, and approaching &s;oftly to the bed where I lay, leaned over me, for a few moments, when
<PB N="18" REF="25">
perceiving that I breathed, he kneeled at my &s;ide, and prayed to heaven, in the fervency of true piety, for my re|covery.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ight of him, I remem|bered the manner, in which he had &s;tept between me and death; as his actions now &s;ufficiently explained my my &s;ituation. My &s;oul was &s;truck with reverential awe, at &s;uch &s;ublime virtue; and joined in his prayers, without pre|&s;uming to interrupt him.</P>
<P>When he had ended, I made an effort to &s;peak, which drew all his at|tention; but my weakne&s;s made my words unintelligible. A fla&s;h of joyful &s;urprize enlightened all his face. He rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven, with a raptur|ous ejaculation of gratitude and prai&s;e; then leaning over me again, exhorted me tenderly to compo&s;e my &s;elf to re&s;t; and not hazard a recovery, of which
<PB N="19" REF="26">
heaven had thus given unexpected hope, by endeavouring to exert a &s;trength above my condition.</P>
<P>I felt the ju&s;tice of what he &s;aid; and te&s;tified by my looks, an a&s;&s;ent, which I was not able to utter.</P>
<P>I continued in this weak e&s;tate for many days, every hour of which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome new in&s;tance of the tenderne&s;s of my friend, (the name by which he always called me) who never entru&s;ted me for a moment to the care of any other per&s;on, except one, in whom he knew he could confide.</P>
<P>Nor was his care confined to the re|covery of my health. He poured the balm of comfort into my &s;oul; and for|tified it again&s;t the evils incident to hu|manity, by inculcating the duty and benefit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of hea|ven, who&s;e ways he proved to be always
<PB N="20" REF="27">
right, however contrary to the wi&s;hes, and in&s;crutable to the wi&s;dom of man.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e delightful con|ferences, which he lengthened as my &s;trength encrea&s;ed, I &s;ometimes di&s;tantly hinted a de&s;ire to be informed of the progre&s;s of the war; but he always eluded my curio&s;ity, changing his di&s;|cour&s;e directly to &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant and affecting points of moral virtue and religion, which he di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a manner, that took off my attention from every other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Painful remembrance made me attri|bute this re&s;erve, which I &s;oon perceived, to a delicacy of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing me, with a recital of the ravages of the Byr&s;ans; for infatuated confidence in their num|bers, prevented every apprehen&s;ion of di&s;a&s;ter to them. I therefore de&s;i&s;ted from my enquiries; and re&s;olved to wait with patience for a di&s;covery, which
<PB N="21" REF="28">
I dreaded, though for a rea&s;on mo&s;t contrary to the truth.</P>
<P>Full of this thought, the employ|ment of my mind, in every moment of his ab&s;ence, was to find out &s;ome me|thod of healing the unhappy breach between the two nations, to which I flattered my&s;elf with an hope, that the humanity, and tenderne&s;s which I had experienced, would in a great mea&s;ure prepare the way.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t glimp&s;e of this hope was too plea&s;ing to be re&s;i&s;ted. I communi|cated it immediately, in the fulne&s;s of my heart, to the good prie&s;t; urging it as a rea&s;on for de&s;iring that the ran&s;om of my liberty &s;hould be fixed; and per|mi&s;&s;ion given me to &s;end to my own country, where I owned that my rank was not incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">This made it impo&s;&s;ible to conceal the fate of my country from me any longer; nor indeed was it nece&s;&s;ary, as my recovery was now compleated; and my mind re&s;tored to its native &s;trength.</P>
<P>The good man, however, opened the black detail gradually, and with all the delicacy, which the nature of it would admit, keeping hope alive to the la&s;t moment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe what I felt, on finding all my forebodings &s;o unhappily fulfilled. A ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the duty of re&s;ignation alone could have &s;aved me from de&s;pair; as the duty I owed my country determined me to try whether it might not &s;till be po&s;&s;ible for me to retrieve its affairs; and re&s;tore it once more to a &s;tate of rational pro&s;pe|rity. I owed the attempt, at lea&s;t, to the blood of Narbal, which flowed in
<PB N="23" REF="30">
my veins; and who&s;e example I had before my eyes.</P>
<P>I departed, therefore, &s;ecretly from the hou&s;e of my kind pre&s;erver, di&s;|gui&s;ed in the habit of a faquir; and went with an heavy heart to learn the truth, of what I &s;carce dared to doubt.</P></Q>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THE appearance of ingratitude, which my departing in this manner bore, was mo&s;t painful to me. But it was not to be avoided.</P>
<P>From &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions dropped at different times, by my benevolent ho&s;t, I had rea&s;on to think that an a&s;&s;urance of acquie&s;cing in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my country, would be expected from me, before I &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, which would obviate my deare&s;t hopes; be|&s;ides, that a regular valediction would
<PB N="24" REF="31">
have been attended with circum&s;tances of tenderne&s;s, of a particular nature, which I doubted my own ability to &s;upport.</P>
<P>The &s;cenes, which every where pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to me, on my entering the country of Byr&s;a, exceeded my wor&s;t apprehen&s;ions. De&s;olation is too &s;oft a name, for a country, which but a few moons before, had flouri&s;hed in all the riches of nature, all the embel|li&s;hments of art; while the few wretched natives, who had e&s;caped the &s;laughter, were driven into the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable parts of the Coptic mountains, where they were condemned to every &s;ervile labour, and interdicted even the &s;ight of their own country, on pain of in&s;tant death.</P>
<P>Grief gave place to indignation. My &s;oul di&s;dained to think of aught but vengeance. Nor was I at a lo&s;s, by what means to &s;eek it. I turned my
<PB N="25" REF="32">
face directly to our colonies, where I doubted not but a ju&s;t de&s;cription of the fate of their mother country, would arou&s;e an effectual re&s;entment, as I knew their force was amply &s;ufficient to overpower every re&s;i&s;tance, which the enemy could oppo&s;e to them.</P>
<P>But what was my a&s;toni&s;hment! How was the object of my indignation changed, when I found all my entreaties rejected, all my remon&s;trances treated with con|tempt! They told me that they owned no country, but that which gave them bread. They enumerated the hard&s;hips, which had driven them from their native home. They blazoned the luxury, the in&s;olence, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Byr&s;ans, in the &s;tronge&s;t colours; and then a&s;ked me, whether I thought &s;uch a people de&s;erved, that they &s;hould hazard their own happine&s;s to endeavour to recover for them a country, which they had been &s;o ba&s;ely afraid to defend; as they
<PB N="26" REF="33">
&s;aid, they well knew, that &s;hould their endeavours prove &s;ucce&s;sful, the Byr|&s;ans would in&s;tantly croud home, from the places whither they had ignomi|niou&s;ly fled with their wealth, and re|&s;ume their former tyranny.</P>
<P>I acknowledged the hand of heaven in the fate of the Byr&s;ans; and &s;ubmit|ting to its &s;acred will, looked among the nations round for a place of refuge, where I might fulfil the number of my days unknown; for I re&s;olved never more to mix with the world, or concern my&s;elf in its ways.</P>
<P>After thinking of many places, with|out being able to determine my choice, it at length occurred to me, that my friend and fellow-&s;ufferer in the &s;hip|wreck, might probably be able to direct me, as he had travelled over the greate&s;t part of the earth, in his profe&s;&s;ion of a merchant. I di&s;po&s;ed, therefore, of all
<PB N="27" REF="34">
the property which belonged to me, among tho&s;e unnatural people; and bidding an eternal adieu to every thing, which had any way been connected with Byr&s;a, repaired to Cairo.</P></Q>

<Q><P>ON my arrival at the hou&s;e of my friend, I found him ju&s;t preparing to go in &s;earch of me, the fate of my country, of which he had received the melancholy tidings, having alarmed his regard for my &s;afety.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s his joy, when he &s;aw me. He hung upon my neck for &s;ome minutes unable to &s;peak, while we mingled the tears of melancholy remembrance and affection.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had explained to him the immediate occa&s;ion of my coming, <Q>My friend,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>it is true, that
<PB N="28" REF="35">
I know many &s;uch places as you &s;eek; but I would, by no means, advi&s;e you to bury your&s;elf thus alive.</Q></P>
<Q><P>Your heart is at pre&s;ent &s;oured by the misfortunes of your country, and &s;ickens at the thought of every thing, which may remind you of them; but believe me, it is not in retirement that you mu&s;t expect relief. The &s;amene&s;s of the &s;cene will &s;oon pall upon you. De&s;titute of other objects, your mind will continually look back to your mi&s;|fortunes; &s;o that in&s;tead of flying from melancholy, you will only give your|&s;elf up an helple&s;s prey to it.</P>
<P>Continue therefore here, with me, for a &s;ea&s;on. The multitudes which croud to this city, from all parts of the world, will afford you ample matter for rational &s;peculation; and divert your thoughts from dwelling on the objects, which at pre&s;ent give you &s;o
<PB N="29" REF="36">
much pain. The retreat which you want, is from your&s;elf; and that can be had only in the bu&s;tle of the world.</P></Q>
<P>I was &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of what he &s;aid, though it unhinged the deare&s;t purpo&s;e of my heart. I knew not what to determine.</P>
<P>While I fluctuated in this &s;tate of uncertainty, I dreamed a dream one night in my bed; and thought I &s;aw the &s;pirit of my father &s;tanding before me. After regarding me for &s;ome minutes with a look of reprehen&s;ion, "Is it thus," methought he &s;aid, <Q>that the de&s;cen|dant of Narbal &s;hould be employed, while his fellow-citizens are groaning under the yoke of &s;lavery? If his country is lo&s;t, are there not others to be found? A brave man can make his home any where. The &s;un not finding
<PB N="30" REF="37">
a place of re&s;t, returns to that from which he begun his cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>On communicating my dream to my friend, he was no le&s;s &s;truck with it than my&s;elf. <Q>You &s;ee,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that heaven interdicts your retiring from the world. Idlene&s;s is the vice of a weak mind. Man was de&s;igned for action; and you are expre&s;sly directed what you are to do. All that remains is to con|cert mea&s;ures properly. Heaven hath given us rea&s;on to direct us, and we are made an&s;werable, in the &s;ucce&s;s of our undertakings, for the u&s;e we make of it.</Q></P>
<P>We then entered into con&s;ultation upon the manner in which I &s;hould pro|ceed. The explication of my dream was obvious. I re&s;olved to repair im|mediately to Byr&s;a, and collect as many of my wretched countrymen, as I could find willing to &s;hare my fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="38">But the difficulty was how to procure an e&s;tabli&s;hment for them, in the place to which I was directed. My friend in|formed me, from his own &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d experi|ence, that the very ruins of Carthage, that once proud queen of Africa, were &s;carcely to be traced.</P>
<P>Nor was the face of the country, he &s;aid, more changed, than the manners of the inhabitants, who, ignorant of every civil art, every &s;ocial and moral virtue, lived in a &s;tate of war with hu|manity it&s;elf; plundering ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;crimi|nately all, who had the misfortune to fall into their hands, and treating them with the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty, only be|cau&s;e in their power.</P>
<P>Di&s;couraging as this repre&s;entation was, I was not to be deterred by it, from that which I held my duty. I re&s;olved to make the attempt, and &s;ub|mit the event to heaven, which could
<PB N="32" REF="39">
never want means to effect its own de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>My friend, who had no other view but my advantage, did not oppo&s;e a re&s;olution, the motive of which he could not controvert. <Q>I have fulfilled one part of the duty of a friend,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>by &s;hewing the difficulty of what you are about to undertake. I will now fulfil the other, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting you in your undertaking. The wealth, which I &s;aved by your means, I will devote to your &s;ervice. Though advanced in age, I feel none of its infirmities. My &s;pirit is good, and my health vigorous.</Q></P>
<P><Q>While you, therefore, go to collect your people, I will make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for conveying them in an happy hour, to the place of their de&s;ti|nation. Direct them to come hither &s;eparately, to avoid giving any alarm; and leave the re&s;t to my care.</Q></P></Q>

<Q><P>I ONCE more a&s;&s;umed the habit of a faquir, under the di&s;gui&s;e of which I eluded the jealous vigilance of the Coptes, while I traver&s;ed the country of Byr&s;a, and all the neighbouring moun|tains, whither the wretched natives had been bani&s;hed by them.</P>
<P>But what was my a&s;toni&s;hment! How did my heart &s;well with indignant grief, when I found all my endeavours to awake them to a &s;en&s;e of virtue, and pious confidence in heaven, of no effect. Their &s;pirit was utterly broken. They &s;unk under their misfortunes; and pre|ferred an indolent life, in the mo&s;t ab|ject &s;tate of &s;lavery, to any pro&s;pect the attainment of which was to be attended with difficulty and danger.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="41">Such a degeneracy weaned my &s;oul from them. I left them to the fate they de&s;erved; and directing the few &s;urvi|vors of my own dome&s;tics and depen|dants, in whom the example of my father had pre&s;erved &s;ome remains of virtue, to meet me at the habitation of my friend in Cairo, I yielded to the impul&s;e of a tenderne&s;s, but badly &s;uited to my &s;ituation, while I went to pay the debt of gratitude to the Coptic prie&s;t, who had in &s;o generous a manner pre|&s;erved my life.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that he had never en|tru&s;ted the care of my recovery to any, but him&s;elf and one per&s;on more. O, my &s;on! that per&s;on was his only daugh|ter; the mo&s;t beautiful of her &s;ex; but beauty was her lowe&s;t prai&s;e. She it was, who watched over me, in the ab&s;ence of her father, and &s;weetened the tendere&s;t offices of humanity, by the manner in which &s;he performed them.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="42">It was impo&s;&s;ible not to have a &s;en&s;e of gratitude for &s;uch obligation; and gratitude between the &s;exes always leads to love.</P>
<P>Nor did I attempt to check the ad|vances of this tender pa&s;&s;ion. I was in every re&s;pect di&s;engaged; and my rank in my own country, I thought, would make my alliance an advantage to any of the Coptes; for, alas! I knew not then that I had no country.</P>
<P>As this plea&s;ing hope accelerated my recovery, it may naturally be judged, what I felt on finding the foundation of it over|turned by the ruin of the Byr&s;an &s;tate. I &s;trove to repre&s;s it, but in vain. It had taken too deep root in my heart, to be ever expelled.</P>
<P>I had before concealed my pa&s;&s;ion from motives of delicacy; and I now continued my re&s;erve from pride. I had
<PB N="36" REF="43">
flattered my&s;elf, that after the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of peace, the propo&s;al would be received with plea&s;ure; but as that event was become impo&s;&s;ible, I thought it would only look like adding to a debt, which I was unable to pay; and this was the chief rea&s;on of my departing &s;ecretly from the hou&s;e of her father. I could not tru&s;t my heart in &s;uch a conflict.</P>
<P>When I arrived near the man&s;ion of my benefactor, I waited in a grove, whither I knew he repaired every morn|ing to perform his devotions.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not attempt to de&s;cribe our meeting. After &s;ome moments of extatic &s;ilence, I an&s;wered the enquiries of his regard, with a candid account of every thing which had befallen me, &s;ince my departure from him. Nor did I conceal the rea&s;ons of my having departed in &s;o &s;ecret a manner.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44">He li&s;tened to me with the mo&s;t anxi|ous attention; and as &s;oon as I had ended, "My &s;on," &s;aid he, <Q>I approve of your conduct in every in&s;tance; and admire a virtue, which acquires addi|tional lu&s;tre, from every addition of di&s;tre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The will of heaven mu&s;t be obeyed. You mu&s;t lead back your few faithful followers, to the &s;eat of their ance&s;tors. Nor &s;hall you lead them only. I will accompany your pious &s;teps: and my daughter al&s;o will be ea&s;ily prevailed upon to go with us. She wi&s;heth not a fate &s;eparate from yours; and my &s;oul &s;o deeply dete&s;ts the atrocious manner, in which this infatuated people have abu&s;ed their &s;ucce&s;s, that I will remain no longer among them.</Q></P>
<P>He then led me to his habitation, where he, the &s;ame evening, rai&s;ed me &s;ecretly to the &s;ummit of human happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="38" REF="45">
by giving me his daughter in marriage; who blu&s;hingly owned that love had had an equal &s;hare with the duties of humanity, in all the tender offices which &s;he had performed for me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have held it a crime to have &s;uffered any indulgence to my&s;elf, how|ever virtuous, to delay my obedience to the divine command, by which I thought my&s;elf directed in my intended expedi|tion. Nor was the zeal of my father le&s;s ardent! We left his habitation in the di&s;gui&s;e, which had &s;o often proved favourable to me; and committing our|&s;elves to the guidance of heaven, arrived at Cairo in &s;afety.</P></Q>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THE hopes which my &s;ucce&s;s thus far had rai&s;ed, were con&s;iderably low|ered by the accounts which I received from my friend on our arrival; who had learned, that the inhabitants of the ancient territories of Carthage were en|gaged in the mo&s;t furious civil wars, which they waged with &s;uch animo&s;ity, that no per&s;on dared to approach their coa&s;ts; an ab&s;olute &s;tranger being the common prey of all; and a connection with any one people expo&s;ing to the out|rages of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>While we were deliberating what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue, amid &s;uch difficulties, my father one day a&s;ked the merchant, if the inhabitants, in the interior parts of the country, were equally barbar|ous with tho&s;e on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts; and if not, whether it might not be po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="40" REF="47">
for us to travel thither by land, &s;o as to avoid the dangers which prevented our going directly to Carthage, and ful|fil the intent of my vi&s;ion at the &s;ame time, by &s;ettling in &s;ome convenient part of the Carthaginian territories, as no particular place had been expre&s;sly pointed out in it.</P>
<P>The merchant was &s;truck at this re|mark; and pau&s;ing for &s;ome time, an|&s;wered, that he had formerly been ac|quainted with many who had traver&s;ed tho&s;e immen&s;e regions, in the caravans which went in pilgrimage to Mecca; one of whom had informed him, that he had &s;een the ruins of &s;everal magni|ficent cities in different parts of them, particularly near the confines of Biledul|gerid, a country which wanted nothing but cultivation to make it equal to any other under heaven; there not being the lea&s;t trace of human habitation within the di&s;tance of many days journey;
<PB N="41" REF="48">
adding, that he had been &s;o &s;truck by the de&s;cription, that he had enquired particularly where tho&s;e ruins lay, and was confident he could find his way to them, though the journey was long, and would be attended both with difficulty and danger.</P>
<P>But the&s;e ob&s;tacles were of no force. The de&s;cription of the country, and its &s;ituation, evidently within the territories of Carthage, determined us to direct our &s;teps thither, hoping that if it was not immediately the place appointed for us, we might wait there in &s;afety till we could find &s;ome more happy time for proceeding to Carthage.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, we &s;et out from Cairo, in number about three hundred per&s;ons, carrying every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a colony, which the care of my friend had provided in the mo&s;t ample mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="49">I &s;hall not de&s;cribe a journey, di&s;|tingui&s;hed only by the inconveniencies naturally incident to the countries thro' which we pa&s;&s;ed, and in which I bore no farther &s;hare, than what regarded my&s;elf and the wife of my bo&s;om; the conduct of every thing being re&s;igned to my friend, who&s;e experience was our be&s;t guide and &s;afeguard through tho&s;e inho&s;pitable regions.</P>
<P>After a pilgrimage of more than twenty moons, in which we &s;uffered every hard&s;hip which humanity could &s;urmount, we arrived at this place. The appearance confe&s;&s;edly was far from encouraging; but it was in the country we wi&s;hed to come to; it was a place where we could hope for re&s;t.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t care was to guard again&s;t the attacks of violence from any of the ro|vers of tho&s;e de&s;arts, who might happen
<PB N="43" REF="50">
to di&s;cover our retreat; which the na|ture of the place enabled us &s;oon to effect.</P>
<P>This building being amply capable of containing our whole number, we re|paired the injuries it had &s;uffered from time or force, and then proceeded to work with &s;pirit abroad, as we were cer|tain that we &s;lept in &s;afety at home.</P>
<P>But alas! this gleam of happine&s;s was too bright to la&s;t. My faithful friend, the merchant, had &s;o far over|&s;trained his &s;trength, in our journey, that nature failed, and he died &s;oon after our arrival. Our tears bore the true&s;t te&s;timony of honour to his merits; but his death was only a pre&s;age of greater misfortunes.</P>
<P>We had &s;carcely begun to ta&s;te the fir&s;t fruits of our hu&s;bandry, when a pe&s;tilential wind &s;truck the labourers in
<PB N="44" REF="51">
the field, who bringing the contagion into our common habitation, it &s;oon ran through our whole colony, with &s;uch malignancy, that in the &s;pace of little more than a moon, there remained alive only my father, my wife, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>What we mu&s;t have felt, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, need not be told. The wi&s;|dom of my father, and the con&s;olations of my wife, were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to keep my heart from rebelling again&s;t heaven, by repining at its will; as I looked upon my&s;elf to be the cau&s;e of their misfortunes.</P>
<P>The lenient hand of time had but ju&s;t begun to heal my &s;oul, when our father &s;unk gently into the &s;weet &s;leep of timely death, leaving his di&s;con&s;olate daughter, and her more unhappy hu&s;band, to mourn a lo&s;s, deplorable in it&s;elf, but ten thou&s;and fold more to be deplored
<PB N="45" REF="52">
from the peculiar circum&s;tances of our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Heaven always proportions our &s;trength to the trials which it lays before us. Re|&s;igned to its good plea&s;ure, my wife and I found inexhau&s;ted comfort in each other for near two hundred moons; when the bite of an adder, as we walked, one unhappy day, on the bank of yonder river, deprived me of the better half of my heart.</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke which I could never have &s;upported, had not an in|fant daughter, the &s;ole pledge of our loves, called forth every virtue to our mutual aid. I remembered the recipro|cal duties of nature, and &s;ubmitted to &s;uffer the mi&s;ery of life for her &s;ake; nor have I ever known another care &s;ince, but for her happine&s;s, without once daring to look forward to the dreadful hour of our &s;eparation.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53">From that time my life hath been a perfect blank. I have not even dared to indulge hope, becau&s;e I have had no rational expectation upon which I can found it. I walk blindfold in the guid|ance of heaven, without pre&s;uming to con&s;ider whither it may lead me.</P>
<P>Whether the di&s;appointment of the de&s;ign, which led me to this place, aro&s;e from my &s;hewing a diffidence in the power of heaven, by letting any human ob&s;tacle divert me from going directly to Carthage; or whether my vi&s;ion was not merely an illu&s;ion of my own ima|gination, I pretend not to &s;ay. I acted for the be&s;t; and I &s;ubmit with reve|rence to the will of heaven.</P>
<P>This, O my &s;on! is the &s;tory of my misfortunes; from which you may, at lea&s;t, receive this melancholy con&s;ola|tion, that you are not the mo&s;t unhappy of mankind.</P></Q>

<P>WHEN the venerable Himilco had thus concluded his narrative, he left me for &s;ome time, as if to regulate his little oeconomy with his daughter, though I believe his fir&s;t purpo&s;e was to give vent to the griefs which naturally attended the remembrance of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>My mind, in the mean while, was too &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with events of &s;uch &s;ingularity to attend to any thing el&s;e. I ran over the various occurrences of his life, and from a compari&s;on of it with my own, drew this con&s;olation, that I mu&s;t certainly have been directed by heaven to his habitation for our mutual hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>I waited &s;ome days, however, before I would mention this thought to Himilco, in order to contemplate more clo&s;ely the
<PB N="48" REF="55">
di&s;po&s;ition of his daughter, before I at|tached my fate to her's; if I &s;hould not rather &s;ay, that I was prevented by fear of a refu&s;al, as my heart became every hour more and more enamoured of her.</P>
<P>Himilco at length relieved me from this embarra&s;&s;ment, by a&s;king me, one day as we walked among the ruins, in what manner I meant to proceed, in or|der to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of heaven, which had been &s;o &s;trikingly communi|cated to me.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to avoid ex|plaining my&s;elf any longer. I therefore opened all my heart to him, as well as the confu&s;ion, inevitable on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, would permit; and waited with the &s;tronge&s;t anxiety for his an&s;wer, as the de|ci&s;ion of my fate.</P>
<P>Regarding me, for &s;ome moments, with a look of inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, <Q>I am
<PB N="49" REF="56">
no &s;tranger,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O my &s;on! to your &s;entiments in re&s;pect to my daughter. I have beheld them labouring in your heart from the fir&s;t day of your arrival here; nor was the di&s;covery di&s;plea&s;ing: on the contrary, I will own, that I have found plea&s;ure in drawing the &s;ame conclu&s;ion with you, from the wonderful manner in which you have been led, as it were by the hand, to this place, where I had never hoped to &s;ee the face of man.</Q></P>
<Q><P>But, O my &s;on! you have much to do before you can think of fixing your re&s;t in any place. The decrees of heaven mu&s;t be fulfilled; and you mu&s;t &s;eek the fate it hath appointed for you, which certainly cannot be here, at lea&s;t as yet.</P>
<P>The clouds, which have ob&s;cured the morning of your life, have evidently ari&s;en from your violation of filial duty, in leaving your father without his con|&s;ent
<PB N="50" REF="57">
or benediction. You mu&s;t there|fore return to him, and receive his for|givene&s;s, before you can expect to be happy.</P>
<P>If after that, your &s;entiments &s;hall re|main the &s;ame as at pre&s;ent, and meet his approbation, you will find no op|po&s;ition to your wi&s;hes, either from my daughter or from me; and heaven will pre&s;erve you for each other, if it ap|proves your union.</P>
<P>Nor is the journey &s;o difficult as you may apprehend. The &s;ea&s;on approaches when the caravan pa&s;&s;es through the&s;e regions, in pilgrimage to Mecca. To the track of that I will direct you, and with them you will travel in &s;afety.</P></Q>
<P>Severely as I felt this delay of my hopes, it was not in my power to make any re|ply to the rea&s;ons which he gave for it. From that day I lived with him and his
<PB N="51" REF="58">
daughter in a &s;tate of happine&s;s, re&s;em|bling that which the ju&s;t enjoy as they draw near to heaven.</P>
<P>When the day of my departure arrived, his daughter pre&s;ented me with a &s;crip, fill|ed with dried fruits of various kinds, as a provi&s;ion for my journey, till I &s;hould meet the caravan, the way of which Hi|milco pointed out to me, by &s;uch certain &s;igns, which he had learned from his friend, that there could be but little danger of my mi&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe my part|ing with his daughter. In compa&s;&s;ion to us both, Himilco hurried me away from this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cene; and leading me to the extremity of the ruins, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with a ki&s;s of peace.</P>
<P>He had before provided me with a fa|quir's habit, the di&s;gui&s;e which had &s;o often been favourable to him&s;elf, in which
<PB N="52" REF="59">
he concealed &s;ome gold, and jewels of great price; as al&s;o a &s;abre and a &s;hield, for my defence, &s;hould it be my misfor|tune to be met by any of the men or bea&s;ts of prey, which ranged tho&s;e boundle&s;s de&s;arts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION X.</HEAD>
<P>MY mind was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed by the recollection of what I had already under|gone, &s;o terrified by the pro&s;pect before me, that I forgot to attend to the &s;igns by which Himilco had directed me to find the track of the caravan; in&s;omuch, that after travelling for &s;everal days longer than he had pre&s;cribed for my gaining it, I found, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible unhappine&s;s, that I had been only involving my&s;elf deeper in tho&s;e inexplicable wilds.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery &s;truck me with the deepe&s;t di&s;may. My heart died in me for &s;ome moments. Recollecting my&s;elf, how|ever,
<PB N="53" REF="60">
and a&s;king forgivene&s;s of heaven for this involuntary di&s;tru&s;t of its protection, I a&s;cended the neare&s;t high tree, to try if I could &s;ee any of the &s;igns by which Hi|milco had marked my way.</P>
<P>Having made the be&s;t ob&s;ervations I could, I re&s;olved, as the evening began to clo&s;e apace, to remain where I was for that night, in hope of continuing my jour|ney in an happier hour the next morning.</P>
<P>As I was &s;oothing my melancholy in contemplating the &s;truggles between light and darkne&s;s for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ky, and comparing them with the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life, my ear was &s;uddenly &s;truck by the &s;ound of &s;everal voices, which appear|ed not to be far di&s;tant from me; when, turning my eye to the &s;ide from whence they came, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a number of children, as I thought, running about in &s;port, near the tree which I had climbed.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">My fir&s;t &s;urprize though, &s;oon gave place to a greater, when I con&s;idered the appearance of the creatures I beheld: their bodies, which were totally uncovered, were white as marble, without any &s;uffu|&s;ion of that redne&s;s by which the blood di&s;tingui&s;hes animal life. Their height did not exceed two cubits at the mo&s;t, at the &s;ame time that their agility was utterly irreconcileable with the &s;trength of children of that age.</P>
<P>While I was gazing in a&s;toni&s;hment at beings, whom I immediately concluded to be &s;ome of tho&s;e inhabitants of the air of whom ancient tradition relates &s;o many wonders, one of them happening to ap|proach my &s;tation, his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling gave him the alarm, which he in&s;tantly communicated to the re&s;t, who crouding around the tree, &s;oon di&s;covered me among the branches, when giving a yell of affright, they all ran into a cavern at the foot of a hill clo&s;e to where I was.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="62">This appearance of fear was &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with the notion I had formed of them, that I was utterly at a lo&s;s to what motive I &s;hould attribute it. I thought it could not be a &s;tratagem to decoy me down, as beings who were lords of the elements, &s;uch as I &s;uppo&s;ed them to be, could enforce their commands by means impo&s;&s;ible for me to re&s;i&s;t. I therefore concluded that my better angel mu&s;t have interpo&s;ed, though imperceptibly to me, and re&s;olved to continue where I was, un|der his protection, till the return of the &s;un (who&s;e light &s;u&s;pends the power of tho&s;e inferior &s;pirits) &s;hould enable me to proceed without fear of mole&s;tation from them.</P>
<P>But a few moments &s;olved the diffi|culty in a more natural manner. I had &s;carce formed this re&s;olution, when I &s;aw an animal of the mo&s;t hideous a&s;pect, which had ever &s;truck my &s;ight, advance toward the place where they had been.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63">His &s;tature was higher than that of the talle&s;t man, but in every proportion un|naturally &s;lender for his height. His tawny &s;kin was thinly &s;haded with hair of the &s;ame colour. His ears hung down, like tho&s;e of the animal abominated by all nations, while his flat vi&s;age came &s;o near the human, as to &s;trike me with &s;hame and horror at the re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Though I had never &s;een a creature of his kind before, I directly knew him, from de&s;cription, to be one of tho&s;e animals which make the middle link between the brute and human natures in the chain of life; &s;uch herds of which, Himilco had informed me, inhabited &s;everal parts of tho&s;e de&s;arts, as would long &s;ince have over-run the whole, were it not for the numbers daily de&s;troyed in their furious broils with each other. Happening to rai&s;e his eyes as he drew near the tree, he e&s;pied me; when chattering his teeth, and
<PB N="57" REF="64">
grinning a &s;mile of horrible delight, he in&s;tantly prepared to a&s;cend to me.</P>
<P>As I knew what kind of enemy I had to deal with, I was not under the &s;ame ap|prehen&s;ion as before; but determined to &s;tand upon my defence. I therefore un|&s;heathed my &s;abre, and placing my&s;elf where the boughs could not impede my arm, the moment he came within my reach, dealt him &s;uch a blow, as felled him to the ground, where he lay, roaring and &s;truggling in vain to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>This in&s;tantly &s;hewed me the nece&s;&s;ity of changing my re&s;olution, and de&s;cend|ing from the tree to &s;lay him outright, le&s;t his cries &s;hould draw more of his fel|lows about me than I might be able to re&s;i&s;t. Accordingly I &s;prung down, and with one &s;troke &s;evered his gha&s;tly head from his body.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was con&s;idering whether I had better rea&s;cend the tree, or proceed to &s;eek &s;ome place of greater &s;afety for the night, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find my&s;elf &s;ur|rounded, on a &s;udden, by the &s;warm of little beings, who had ju&s;t before fled away as affrighted at the &s;ight of me.</P>
<P>Though I thought them impa&s;&s;ive to human force, I naturally put my&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, calling to them at the &s;ame time, in a menacing tone, to keep at a di&s;tance from me.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon found that my apprehen|&s;ions were groundle&s;s, and that they were really as much afraid of me as I could po&s;&s;ibly be of them.</P>
<P>On hearing my voice, they &s;tarted back, and huddling clo&s;e together, &s;tood evi|dently
<PB N="59" REF="66">
fluctuating between fear and joy; their eyes &s;parkling with exultation when they looked at the dead &s;avage, but &s;ink|ing again with diffidence and affright, when turned toward me.</P>
<P>This in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted it to me, that the creature I had &s;lain was their enemy; and that their fear of me proceeded from my re&s;emblance of him. To remove this fear therefore, I went to the dead body, and giving it a &s;troke or two with my &s;abre, &s;purned the head from me with a look and ge&s;ture of the &s;tronge&s;t dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Such a proof of my enmity to their foe, was received as an expre&s;s treaty of friend&s;hip and alliance with them. They directly &s;hook off all fear, and running with &s;houts of joy and triumph to the dead body, treated it with every in&s;ult of hatred and revenge, till their rage was glutted; when &s;eeming to recollect to whom they were indebted for his death,
<PB N="60" REF="67">
they turned their attention to me, and one of them, who&s;e features, on his nearer approach, I could perceive bore the marks of old age, advanced alone to me, and put him&s;elf, without apprehen&s;ion, into my power; while the re&s;t, giving a &s;hout of joy, made &s;igns to me to go with them into their cavern.</P>
<P>Though by this time I was convinced, that far from being what I had at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, they were in reality only one of tho&s;e varieties in which nature delights to di&s;port her&s;elf (a diminutive &s;pecies of the human kind) from who&s;e force I had as little rea&s;on to apprehend danger, as from their pre&s;ent intentions; yet &s;uch was the power of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o difficult to dive&s;t the mind of the apprehen&s;ions of ignorance, that I felt a kind of horror in complying with that invitation, which &s;tronger curio&s;ity would not permit me to refu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="68">This momentary he&s;itation, however, e&s;caped their notice; and they &s;hewed the highe&s;t plea&s;ure at my compliance. They &s;houted, they danced, and fri&s;ked around me all the way to the cavern; where the &s;ame one, who had advanced to me before, and whom I &s;aw the re&s;t treated with re|&s;pect, beckoned to me to &s;top, while they removed a number of gins and &s;harpened &s;tones, with which the entrance was be&s;et in &s;uch a manner, as made their retreat inacce&s;&s;ible to any creature bigger than them&s;elves, and which was not acquainted al&s;o with the &s;everal windings between them.</P>
<P>When the pa&s;&s;age was thus cleared, my guide again made &s;igns to me to follow him, &s;tooping, though unnece&s;&s;arily for him&s;elf, as he entered, to &s;hew me that I mu&s;t &s;toop.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for words to expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment when I entered this &s;ubterra|neous
<PB N="62" REF="69">
city, for &s;uch I immediately per|ceived it to be; the in&s;ide of the hill be|ing entirely &s;cooped out, whether by na|ture or art I could not di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;o as to make a cavity capable of containing many times the number of the little com|munity which then inhabited it, and di|vided into regular compartments proper for the few purpo&s;es of their &s;imple life.</P>
<P>As the &s;hades of night had by this time covered the earth, I expected to have found the cavern either involved in dark|ne&s;s, or artificially illuminated by fire; but no &s;ooner had I entered, than I ima|gined I &s;aw another &s;ky, which emitted a light, pallid indeed and feeble, but &s;uffi|cient to di&s;cover every pre&s;ent object to the eye.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t impul&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e, I rai&s;ed my hand to what I thought the &s;ky, when I found that the light was only reflected from a vi&s;cid &s;ub&s;tance, which di&s;tilled
<PB N="63" REF="70">
through the roof and &s;ides of the cavern, and retained &s;o much of the rays of the &s;un, admitted through different crevices in the day, as reflected thus &s;erved to &s;up|ply his place during his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Having replaced their defences, and &s;ettled all things in a &s;tate of &s;afety, the whole people, to the number of about forty, of both &s;exes and every age, ga|thered around me as I &s;at upon the ground, after the example of my leader; where, having &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity by looking at me for &s;ome time, the greater part withdrew to their dome&s;tic concerns.</P>
<P>In a little time &s;ome of them returned, laden with fruits and the fle&s;h of various birds and other little animals, &s;ome of which appeared to have been dried, or rather &s;odden, in the &s;un, but the greater part was raw; and &s;etting them before me, my ho&s;t, as I may call him, eat him|&s;elf, to encourage me to eat.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="71">As I had taken no food from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, I followed his example, and eat of the fruits &s;ufficiently for the &s;up|port of nature; but I loathed to ta&s;te the fle&s;h, though he &s;trove to tempt me, by eating with a voracity which &s;hewed that he thought it mo&s;t delicious.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed our repa&s;t, he took me to a &s;pring, which i&s;&s;ued from the &s;ide of the cave, where I &s;lacked my thir&s;t, and wa&s;hed my feet in a pool filled with the overflowing of the water; after which, ob&s;erving that I was over-powered with &s;leep, he led me through various windings to a kind of niche, large enough to &s;erve me for an apartment, where he made &s;igns to me to lay me down to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved to comply with every thing which &s;hould be propo&s;ed to me, for that night, I directly obeyed him, letting him &s;ee me, however, lay my &s;word un|der
<PB N="65" REF="72">
my head, in &s;uch a manner, that it could not be removed without awaking me; a care of which I afterwards found I had no occa&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION XII.</HEAD>
<P>MY mind had been &s;o over-laboured in the ob&s;ervation of the&s;e &s;trange events, that I &s;oon &s;unk into a profound &s;leep, in which all my cares were buried, till the next morning was far advanced, as I could judge by the light tran&s;mitted through a crevice in the roof of the cave, near the place where I lay.</P>
<P>Having looked around me, and found every thing in the &s;ame &s;tate as when I went to &s;leep, I lay &s;till for &s;ome time, in expectation of my ho&s;t's coming to me; till my patience being quite exhau&s;ted, I aro&s;e, intending to depart without farther delay, in hope of di&s;entangling my&s;elf
<PB N="66" REF="73">
from that part of the wilderne&s;s before the night &s;hould come on.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon found my intention defeated. The cavern was cut into &s;uch an inexpli|cable labyrinth, that I wandered through it for a con&s;iderable time without being able to find the entrance, or even to re|turn to the place where I had &s;lept; never, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;eeing, or even hearing one of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Lo&s;ing, at length, all hope of extri|cating my&s;elf, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I called aloud &s;everal times; upon which I immediately heard the buzzing of their voices all around me.</P>
<P>After &s;ome minutes, my ho&s;t, as I have called him, came toward me; but with an appearance of di&s;tru&s;t and apprehen|&s;ion. To remove an impre&s;&s;ion, there|fore, which I &s;aw might be di&s;advantage|ous
<PB N="67" REF="74">
to me, I &s;at down upon the ground, and reaching out my hand with a &s;mile, the hone&s;t creature, &s;u&s;pecting no deceit, as he de&s;igned none, re&s;umed his former confidence, and &s;at down near me with evident plea&s;ure; whereupon the whole community, who had waited the event of his approach, in&s;tantly came round me, with the &s;ame freedom as before.</P>
<P>The light, which now entered through various apertures in the roof of the cavern, enabled me to &s;ee every thing di&s;tinctly. I have already de&s;cribed their &s;ize, and the peculiar colour of their bodies; in other re&s;pects they differed not from the ordinary race of men, a &s;ingularity in one feature excepted, which at fir&s;t view was not &s;o plea&s;ing. This was a prominence in their eyes, from whence probably pro|ceeded their &s;eeing &s;o much better in a feeble, than a &s;trong light; and may have been the cau&s;e of their chu&s;ing &s;uch a gloomy habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="75">Our amity being thus re&s;tored, on my making &s;igns of a de&s;ire to go out of the cavern, my ho&s;t in&s;tantly led me to the entrance, where he &s;topped, being unable to bear the light of the &s;un; but gave me to under&s;tand, that he would wait my return, by &s;eating him&s;elf upon the ground.</P>
<P>Our de&s;ire for any thing is always in proportion to the difficulty which attends the attainment of it. Though I was &s;o anxious to continue my journey but a few minutes before, I now no &s;ooner found my&s;elf &s;o perfectly at my liberty, than that anxiety cea&s;ed; and I re&s;olved to indulge my curio&s;ity, by &s;taying a few days among this extraordinary people, to ob&s;erve their cu&s;toms and manners, and, if po&s;&s;ible, acquire &s;ome knowledge of their language.</P>
<P>Accordingly, as &s;oon as I had looked around me for a few minutes, to mark
<PB N="69" REF="76">
the way I came, I went back to the mouth of the cave, where I found my ho&s;t, who expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t &s;atisfaction at my return.</P>
<P>The little community, who now re|garded me as one of them&s;elves, pur&s;ued their u&s;ual occupations as if I was not pre&s;ent; by which means I &s;oon had an opportunity of making all the ob&s;erva|tions I de&s;ired.</P>
<P>I have taken notice before, that their bodies were entirely naked; nor was that cu&s;tom, however &s;trange to me, in the lea&s;t to be wondered at, when their &s;itua|tion was properly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Natural nece&s;&s;ity for cloathing they had none, as their place of habitation defended them from every inclemency of weather; and to the artificial nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hame, they were &s;trangers, both from their
<PB N="70" REF="77">
&s;eclu&s;ion from the re&s;t of the world; and that it had never entered into their thoughts, that nature had made any parts of their bodies objects of &s;hame; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, they performed all the natural functions wherever &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted the performance of them.</P>
<P>Their de&s;ires were as limited, as their powers of gratification. They eat fruits, with which the happine&s;s of the climate &s;upplied them, at every &s;ea&s;on; and the fle&s;h of birds, and tho&s;e &s;maller animals which we denominate vermin, taken in gins, in the con&s;truction of which all the powers of their ingenuity &s;eemed to terminate.</P>
<P>Implements of dome&s;tic oeconomy, they knew not the u&s;e of. They eat their food without any preparation. They &s;tooped to the fountain to drink, and when their appetites were &s;atisfied, they laid them&s;elves down to &s;leep, with|out
<PB N="71" REF="78">
farther care, for the whole day; the &s;trong light of the &s;un &s;u&s;pending their occupations, as much as darkne&s;s doth tho&s;e of other men.</P>
<P>I found no great difficulty in acquir|ing a &s;ufficient knowledge of their lan|guage, which was far from being co|pious, their &s;ituation, and &s;implicity of life &s;ugge&s;ting but very few ideas: They had names for the things they knew, and expre&s;&s;ions for the u&s;es they made of them; and that was nearly its whole extent; for they never combined their ideas, nor employed the faculties of the mind on its own operations.</P>
<P>Of all the pa&s;&s;ions which agitate the heart, and equally con&s;titute the happi|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery of man, they &s;eemed to have a &s;en&s;e only of fear and love; if I &s;hould not add hatred and joy! though no more than con&s;equences of the for|mer, in the only in&s;tance, I ever could
<PB N="72" REF="79">
di&s;cover of them, their behaviour when I &s;lew the &s;avage! nor were the effects even of the&s;e powerful or la&s;ting.</P>
<P>When the entrance of their cavern was defended, in the manner I have de|&s;cribed, they appeared to have no farther fear; and of love, I could never per|ceive the lea&s;t re&s;emblance, except in parental affection for their offspring; &s;uch as nature hath imprinted on every animal, for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving the &s;pecies: the attachments of friend|&s;hip, or &s;eclu&s;ive connections between the &s;exes, appearing to be utterly un|known to them.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that they &s;eemed to pay re&s;pect, to the one, who fir&s;t ap|proached, and afterwards attended par|ticularly to me! but I could never per|ceive that he had any authority or in|fluence over them.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="80">They had given place to his &s;uperior intrepidity, and followed his example in that in&s;tance; and that was all: for of an e&s;tabli&s;hed authority or government, there did not appear the fainte&s;t &s;hadow among them, any more than of religion; of the very fir&s;t principles of which, &s;up|po&s;ed to be univer&s;ally written in the human heart, they were utterly igno|rant; nor when I was able, in &s;ome manner, to conver&s;e with them, could I ever make them form the lea&s;t concep|tion of either.</P>
<P>Till their offspring were able to pro|cure their own food, they followed their parents, who fed them; but with this nece&s;&s;ity the attachment on both &s;ides ended &s;o ab&s;olutely, that I could never trace even the remembrance of it. Every one did ju&s;t what they plea&s;ed, without re&s;pect being paid to, or offence taken by any other.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="81">I have &s;aid, that they took me, at fir&s;t, for one of tho&s;e &s;avages, with which they live in a continual &s;tate of war. But when they were undeceived by my killing their enemy, and they had entered into amity with me, they ex|pre&s;&s;ed no curio&s;ity to know who I was, or whence I came, my words &s;eeming to make impre&s;&s;ion upon them no longer than upon the air, through which the &s;ound of them pa&s;&s;ed to their ears.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this inattention proceeded from pride. Their ignorance of them&s;elves was equally great. When I a&s;ked if they were originally of that country, they could not compre|hend what I meant; nor did they know whether there was any more of their own &s;pecies in the world.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity &s;oon took in the whole of &s;uch a narrow &s;phere. I left them at the end of &s;even days, convinced of
<PB N="75" REF="82">
the contemptible ignorance of tho&s;e tor|pid vi&s;ionaries, who affect to place hap|pine&s;s in the ab&s;ence of pa&s;&s;ion, and being content merely with the &s;upport of nature.</P>
<P>A compari&s;on of &s;uch a people with my&s;elf, gave me a con&s;equence, in my own eyes, which re&s;tored the vigor of my mind, and &s;upported me through my journey. I &s;oon recovered the way-marks pointed out to me by Himilco, from which I had not &s;trayed &s;o far, as the dejection of my &s;pirits had made me apprehend; and on the &s;ixth day from my leaving the little people, joined the caravan.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>AS the expre&s;s intent of their jour|ney, continued the captive, was to perform a religious duty, I expected to have met with nothing, but acts of virtue, and &s;entiments of piety, among the pilgrims: But a very little time &s;hewed me, that the profe&s;&s;ed intention doth not always govern the actions of man, even in tho&s;e &s;acred matters.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="84">I had not been long with the caravan, when my attention was &s;truck by one of the pilgrims, who&s;e demeanour &s;hewed a degree of &s;anctity &s;uperior to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Not content with performing all the rites ordained by his religion, he doubled them in every in&s;tance. Nature &s;eemed unequal to the rigor of his ab&s;tinence. The hours allotted to re&s;t, he &s;pent in prayer: and his exhortations were num|bered by the &s;teps of his journey.</P>
<P>Such a &s;ight was balm to my heart. I thought the merits of this one man overbalanced the failings of all the re&s;t. 'Virtue cannot be a &s;hadow,' I rea&s;oned with my&s;elf. <Q>I have now met the &s;ub&s;tance, upon which I may &s;afely form my judgment.</Q></P>
<P>But a moment's reflection damped the plea&s;ure of this thought. <Q>I have been
<PB N="79" REF="85">
deceived before,</Q> I continued, <Q>and how can I be certain, that I am not &s;o now! That I do not &s;ee this man al&s;o in a mirrour! I will ob&s;erve him better before I pre&s;ume to judge.</Q></P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e I attached my&s;elf more clo&s;ely to him, than I had done before; when the event was far from confirming the opinion I had conceived in his favour. I &s;oon thought I &s;aw pride &s;upply the place of piety, in his mo&s;t exemplary acts of devotion; and virtue made u&s;e of as a veil to cover vice.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery almo&s;t drove me to de&s;pair. 'To what purpo&s;e,' I ex|claimed, in the angui&s;h of my &s;oul, <Q>do I &s;ee life, when I am not able to judge of what I &s;ee? This man's actions are all good. Why then &s;hould I pre&s;ume to deduce them from a bad motive? They &s;urely are the be&s;t index of the
<PB N="80" REF="86">
heart. I have formed a wrong judg|ment of him, in one in&s;tance, or the other; and at any rate the former error was the more pardonable. Where there is any uncertainty, a good heart will always judge favourably. Let me therefore hope, that I have deceived my&s;elf by a fal&s;e &s;agacity; and that my fir&s;t opinion of him was right.</Q> But this hope was of &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>The Santone, for by that venerable appellation was he di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other pilgrims in the caravan, was encou|raged by the admiration he had rai&s;ed, to form &s;till higher hopes.</P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me one evening, after prayer, 'I have ob&s;erved,' &s;aid he, <Q>my &s;on, with what piety you perform the rites of religion; and how attentively you li&s;ten to the exhortation of my words. Come to my tent, at
<PB N="81" REF="87">
the third hour of the night, when my private devotions will be fini&s;hed, that we may confer together upon the ways of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Such an invitation was far from being unplea&s;ing to me, as it mu&s;t give me an opportunity of clearing up the doubts with which my mind was perplexed. I therefore punctually attended the ap|pointment of the Santone, whom I found expecting my arrival.</P>
<P>Placing me be&s;ide him, on his carpet, <Q>I have ob&s;erved,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O my &s;on, the regularity of your deportment; and rejoice to have found in &s;o young a man, one who is worthy of my friend&s;hip. I read your heart in your looks; and will open my&s;elf to you, without fear or re&s;erve; a confidence, which will not only &s;hew you things in their proper colours, but al&s;o convince you of the
<PB N="82" REF="88">
advantage of attaching your&s;elf to me, and entering into all my views.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s, how much I was &s;urprized at this addre&s;s. The manner was as unexpected, as the matter was incomprehen&s;ible; &s;uch a familiar &s;tyle of di&s;cour&s;e being totally different from the ab&s;tracted broken &s;en|tences, in which he was accu&s;tomed to deliver his &s;entiments. However, I was &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of my&s;elf to conceal my a&s;toni&s;hment; and the Santone tak|ing my habitual &s;ilence for a&s;&s;ent, conti|nued his di&s;cour&s;e in the&s;e words.</P>

<Q><P>YOU are doubtle&s;sly &s;urprized at the au&s;terities, which you daily &s;ee me practi&s;e upon my&s;elf; and think that enthu&s;ia&s;m alone can &s;upport me through them. But that opinion is &s;uperficially drawn. I act from the univer&s;al prin|ciple of human nature, which propo&s;es the gratification of the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, in every act; however repugnant that act may be to it in appearance.</P>
<P>The object of my wi&s;hes, the end of all my labours, is <HI>power;</HI> and that in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e. Let warriors ravage nations, and lead the wretched inhabitants in chains, my empire is of a more exalted nature. I &s;corn to hold the body in &s;ubjection, while the mind is free. Of this empire you are your|&s;elf a witne&s;s, and a &s;ubject. How I have e&s;tabli&s;hed it, and to what further
<PB N="84" REF="90">
purpo&s;es I mean to improve its influ|ence, are the things which I intend to reveal in confidence to you.</P></Q>
<P>I could contain my&s;elf no longer. <Q>Gracious heaven!</Q> I exclaimed, <Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible that the religious exerci&s;es, which &s;trike the world with &s;uch reve|rence, can proceed from any other motive than true piety?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Moderate your zeal, my &s;on,</Q> he returned, with a contemptuous &s;mile, <Q>and all the&s;e matters &s;hall be explained to you. True piety never &s;trikes the world with reverence, becau&s;e it is never &s;een by the world. It is an im|mediate intercour&s;e between the &s;oul and heaven, carried on in acts merely &s;piritual, and which cannot be repre|&s;ented to &s;en&s;e. Whenever you &s;ee a man perform religious exerci&s;es in pub|lic; and e&s;pecially if he affects to ex|ceed in them, you may &s;afely conclude
<PB N="85" REF="91">
either that his rea&s;on is di&s;ordered, or that he acts from motives mo&s;t dif|ferent from tho&s;e which he profe&s;&s;es.</Q></P>
<Q><P>What &s;ervice can the Deity receive from the works of man? Is it not de|rogating from the idea we have of his wi&s;dom, to think that he can approve acts of folly or madne&s;s? Is it not offer|ing an affront to his goodne&s;s, to &s;up|po&s;e that he can take plea&s;ure in the &s;ufferings of his creatures? and yet to &s;uch ab&s;urd, &s;uch impious opinions, do all tho&s;e au&s;terities, tho&s;e religious exerci&s;es, which impo&s;e upon the greater part of the world, owe their credit.</P>
<P>The wi&s;er few, indeed, turn this folly to their own advantage; and upon this apparent &s;elf-denial, the&s;e volun|tary &s;ufferings, found the firme&s;t power of enjoying all the real plea&s;ures of which life is capable.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92">The love of plea&s;ure, and the fear of pain, are the ruling principles of the human heart, in which they maintain an uninterrupted &s;truggle for &s;uperio|rity.</P>
<P>Now the whole art of governing mankind con&s;i&s;ts in the management of the&s;e two principles; which by &s;ome means has become the peculiar province of prie&s;thood, and is the &s;cepter with which they rule the world; for as the ignorance of mankind hath been brought to believe the plea&s;ures of nature to be crimes again&s;t its author, and that the &s;ame authority, which has arbitrarily made them &s;uch, has given power to a particular &s;et of people, to pre&s;cribe means of avoiding the puni&s;hment of them hereafter, by &s;ufferings here, (for the impo&s;ition would have refuted it&s;elf if the puni&s;hment had not been po&s;t|poned to another &s;tate, from which we can have no intelligence, though, at the
<PB N="87" REF="93">
&s;ame time, to counterbalance that delay of commencement, there hath been given to it, an eternity of duration) nothing is ea&s;ier, than for tho&s;e, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be entru&s;ted with this power, to turn the commutation of that puni&s;hment to their own advantage, in what manner they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to exert this power mo&s;t effectually, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike the &s;en&s;es of its objects, with an ap|pearance of &s;uperior &s;anctity, which may be con&s;idered in the double light, of a con&s;equence of the &s;acred character, and a confirmation of its efficacy; and this cannot be done any way &s;o well as by ab&s;taining, in the extreme degree, from tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which are repre|&s;ented to be crimes; becau&s;e it appears to be a conviction that they really are &s;uch; and that indulgence in them is as dangerous, as it is repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="94">Nor is this the only advantage de|rived from this ab&s;tinence. It is thought to be &s;o meritorious, from the &s;uppo&s;ed difficulty of it, as to give &s;uch an intere&s;t with the power, in obedience to whom it is pretended to be practi&s;ed, that nothing can be refu&s;ed to the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of him who practi&s;es it; and this is the completion of his work.</P>
<P>As to the difficulty of this ab&s;ti|nence, it is all imaginary. In re&s;pect to food, the &s;imple&s;t is that which &s;up|ports nature be&s;t; and the le&s;s which is taken, even of that, the better &s;he per|forms her functions. Were the plea|&s;ure of temperance, both in the quan|tity and quality of aliment, known, lux|ury and exce&s;s would &s;oon be bani&s;hed from the world: and as to other appe|tites, their force is derived merely from their indulgence. Every day they are re&s;trained, the re&s;traint becomes le&s;s
<PB N="89" REF="95">
trouble&s;ome; till, in the end, it cea&s;es to be a trouble.</P>
<P>Of the progre&s;s which I have already made, in the execution of my de&s;ign, you are your&s;elf a witne&s;s. The greater part of the difficulty, and all doubt of &s;ucce&s;s are conquered. Nothing re|mains now, but to pur&s;ue the path, which lieth plain and ea&s;y before me; and it will &s;oon lead me to the &s;ummit of my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>In the mean time I have need of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in my labours, an a&s;&s;ociate in my power, who will con&s;ult his own intere&s;t by his fidelity to me; and for this purpo&s;e I have &s;elected you from among the numbers, who would be proud of &s;uch an honour.</P>
<P>My intention is to per&s;i&s;t in my pre|&s;ent manner, till I &s;hall have performed this pilgrimage to Mecca; on the ad|ditional
<PB N="90" REF="96">
credit of which, I propo&s;e, at my return to my native country of Biledulgerid, to promulgate a new reli|gion, which I have already planned on the principles mo&s;t likely to &s;trike tho&s;e people; and as &s;oon as it &s;hall have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their minds, I will then unite the civil to the religious power, and e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;overeignty which no force can &s;ubvert, as it will be founded in the minds of my &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I have thus, my &s;on, opened my whole purpo&s;e to you; and have no doubt of your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in bringing it to perfection, as you will &s;hare the benefit, while I live; and enjoy the whole after my decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance, in which I &s;hall require your co-operation, is this.</P>
<P>To-morrow, after the evening prayer, I will feign to fall into a trance; which
<PB N="91" REF="97">
I can do without danger of detection, by means of a compo&s;ition, which hath the power of &s;u&s;pending every animal function, for a length of time, propor|tioned to the quantity in which it is taken, &s;o as to effect an appearance of death, not po&s;&s;ible to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the reality.</P>
<P>While I lie, in all appearance, inani|mate, you mu&s;t, on a &s;udden, fix your eyes upon the air, ju&s;t over me; and then falling on your knees, pray aloud with fervency.</P>
<P>The croud will naturally gather around you, to know the meaning of this conduct; when you mu&s;t point toward the place, where I lie, and a&s;k them, with looks and exclamations of a&s;toni&s;hment, if they do not &s;ee a cele&s;|tial &s;pirit hanging upon the wing over me?</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="98">This will fix their attention, and fire their already heated imaginations to &s;uch a degree, that many of them will think they really &s;ee what you de&s;cribe; while all the re&s;t will a&s;&s;ent to it, to avoid the imputation of infidelity, and for fear of the con&s;equences of contra|dicting the &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;uper|&s;tition.</P>
<P>When this &s;pirit is thus rai&s;ed, I know how to direct it to the be&s;t ad|vantage. I will feign a revelation of tho&s;e things which I would have them believe, to the truth of which I will thus make them&s;elves bear witne&s;s.</P>
<P>When this fir&s;t &s;tep is happily taken, we will con&s;ult how we are to proceed farther.</P></Q>

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the hor|ror, with which I was &s;truck by this propo&s;al. I thought my&s;elf contami|nated by the bare communication of it; and held his confidence as the greate&s;t di&s;honour which had ever befallen me; concluding that he mu&s;t have &s;een an appearance of guilt in my looks, to make him &s;elect me for his accomplice.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I determined to open the my&s;|tery of his iniquity; but when I con&s;i|dered the con&s;equence of contradicting enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;uper&s;tition, as he had &s;aid; I did not think my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in throwing away my own life, where I had no pro&s;pect of defeating his impious de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="100">But happily an opportunity &s;oon offered, of extricating me from this difficulty.</P>
<P>Along with the caravan, in which I travelled, there journied a company of merchants, who were going to Bagdat and Ba&s;&s;ora, to barter the commodities of Africa, for tho&s;e of the A&s;iatic regions.</P>
<P>We had pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;thmus of Suez, the very day before the Santone had opened his intentions to me. As I re|turned from his tent to my own, my way led me by the quarter of tho&s;e merchants, whom I found preparing to &s;eparate from the caravan, the next morning.</P>
<P>It in&s;tantly &s;truck me, that I might e&s;cape the danger of refu&s;ing to enter into his iniquitous &s;chemes, by depart|ing along with the&s;e merchants. I ac|cordingly
<PB N="95" REF="101">
went directly to my tent; and taking my &s;crip upon my back, and my &s;taff in my hand, joined them, ju&s;t before they began their march.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before my &s;oul could free it&s;elf from the horror with which the profligacy of the Santone had &s;truck me. At length, after weighing delibe|rately every thing, which he had &s;aid, I found con&s;olation in reflecting, that the abu&s;e of the be&s;t things produces the wor&s;t effects; and that the excellence of true piety was only proved more &s;ig|nally, by its being able to &s;tand the te&s;t of &s;uch pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our journey to Bagdat, without meeting any occurrence worth relating.</P>
<P>High as my curio&s;ity had been rai&s;ed, by the accounts which I had heard of this imperial city, my impatience to embrace
<PB N="96" REF="102">
the knees of my father was &s;o &s;trong, that I &s;hould not have delayed an hour in it, had it been in my power to proceed: but all the neighbouring nations were in|volved in &s;uch furious wars, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to wait for a favourable opportunity, before I could expect to perform my journey in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The &s;cene I was now in, was &s;o utterly new to me, that I could only gaze in &s;ilent admiration, without being able to form any judgment of what I &s;aw. The infinite variety of the objects which at|tracted my attention, prevented my at|tending to any of them. I had not time to ob&s;erve one, when another pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my ob&s;ervation, &s;o that I literally was lo&s;t in the wilderne&s;s of my own thoughts.</P>
<P>While I was in this &s;tate of perplexity, I happened one day, as I performed my devotions in the principal mo&s;que, to
<PB N="97" REF="103">
kneel clo&s;e to an aged man, who in&s;tantly fixed his eyes upon me in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner.</P>
<P>As I could not recollect that I had ever &s;een him before, I concluded he mu&s;t have mi&s;taken me for &s;ome other per&s;on; and &s;oon as the prayers were ended, departed without taking any further notice of him: but I had not gone far, before I was acco&s;ted abruptly by a &s;lave, who bade me, with an air of authority, to follow him.</P>
<P>Though I was naturally &s;urprized at &s;uch an addre&s;s, I judged, from the man|ner in which he &s;poke, that it would be in vain for me to refu&s;e; and therefore, to make a merit of my compliance, obeyed without a&s;king him any que&s;tions, or even ob&s;erving whither he led me, till I found my&s;elf in one of the courts of the Khaliff's palace.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="104">I had not waited long, when I was in|troduced into the pre&s;ence of the grand vi&s;ier, whom I directly knew to be the per&s;on, who had regarded me &s;o atten|tively, &s;ome minutes before, at the mo&s;que.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I approached him, <Q>I would know,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O young man, who thou art, and what thine occupation is in this city?</Q></P>
<P>The manner in which he &s;poke was far from giving me any alarm. As I was con&s;cious of no crime, I was free from fear; and re&s;olved, while I adhered &s;trictly to truth, not to enter into the parti|culars of my life, farther than was nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><Q>May the &s;ub&s;titute of him, who&s;e power rules the world, I an&s;wered, live for ever! Your &s;lave cometh from the remote&s;t parts of Arabia the Happy. My motive
<PB N="99" REF="105">
for leaving my native country, was to &s;ee the manners of different people, and prove the precepts of education by ex|perience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ha&s;t thou not been among the Be|douins?</Q> he interrupted me &s;ternly; <Q>and ha&s;t thou not even led tho&s;e troops of ravagers, in their attacks upon the caravans of the true believers?</Q></P>
<P>Unexpected as this que&s;tion was, it did not di&s;concert me. I an&s;wered him in the boldne&s;s of innocence and truth; and in few words gave him an account of the manner in which I had been taken captive by the Bedouins, and the rea&s;on of their di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me from among them.</P>
<P>The force of truth is irre&s;i&s;tible. He heard me with attention; and as &s;oon as I had ended: <Q>Thy virtue hath been proved by many trials,</Q> &s;aid he, ri&s;ing from the &s;opha upon which he &s;at, and embracing
<PB N="100" REF="106">

<P>I need not attempt to de&s;cribe the effect which the&s;e words had on me. I returned his embrace with equal warmth, and for|got that I had ever been unhappy.</P>
<P>My friend, for he would never permit me to addre&s;s him by any other appella|tion, was not &s;atisfied with heaping all the benefits in his own power upon me.

<P>MY friend, the vi&s;ier, who had de|&s;cended far into the vale of years, fixed his eye upon me as a proper &s;ucce&s;&s;or in tho&s;e cares, to the weight of which he began to feel him&s;elf unequal. He re|commended me therefore in &s;uch &s;trong terms to the Khaliff, that he made no dif|ficulty of permitting him to re&s;ign the reins of government, and entru&s;ting them to me.</P>
<P>The clouds which had attended every &s;tep of my a&s;cent to this height of power, vani&s;hed the moment I had attained it: and in their place I met nothing but &s;miles
<PB N="102" REF="108">
of congratulation, and profe&s;&s;ions of at|tachment and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Unpracti&s;ed in the ways of men, I readily gave credit to appearances, which I was not con&s;cious of having given any rea&s;on to doubt, and formed the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;chemes for turning the influen|tial power I now enjoyed to the general advantage; the &s;plendor of the pre&s;ent &s;cene dazzling my eyes, and making me over-look the e&s;&s;ential re&s;emblance be|tween it and the former, in which I had met &s;o mortifying a di&s;appointment, in my de&s;igns of the &s;ame kind, among the Be|douins.</P>
<P>In this delu&s;ion I eagerly re&s;umed my favourite &s;cheme of reformation, confid|ing in the obvious rectitude and advan|tage of it, and the integrity of my own heart, to &s;ecure my intere&s;t with the Kha|liff; and in his power to protect me from
<PB N="103" REF="109">
the attempts of any, who &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of virtue and public &s;pirit, as to oppo&s;e me in the execution.</P>
<P>Nor was I deceived in this confidence. The di&s;cernment and ju&s;tice of the Khaliff viewed my intentions in a ju&s;t light, and they confirmed me &s;till more &s;trongly in his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>But there were many ob&s;tacles in the way to my wi&s;hes, which I fore&s;aw not at the fir&s;t; or rather looked upon in the oppo&s;ite light.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t of the&s;e aro&s;e from the power of appointing to places of profit or honour under the government, which was apparently ve&s;ted in the office I bore; and not only overwhelmed me with vex|ation, but al&s;o counteracted my de&s;igns, though I had built upon it as one of the &s;ure&s;t means of their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="110">Empty as the honour, and poor the profits of many of tho&s;e places were, the number and importunity of the candi|dates for them embarra&s;&s;ed me beyond expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some pleaded their own merits, others tho&s;e of their ance&s;tors; this one his youth and ability to do &s;ervice, that his age and the &s;ervices he had done, though he was now incapable of repeating them: one urged his poverty, and the nece&s;&s;ity he had for relief; another his riches, and the influence they gave him over his fel|lows. In a word, every circum&s;tance and di&s;tinction, which varies the motley view of life, was alledged to enforce their pre|ten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nor was this &s;olicitation only for &s;uch places as were actually vacant. They vied with equal eagerne&s;s for tho&s;e which were already filled; blackening the characters of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, as well as of each other,
<PB N="105" REF="111">
with every calumny which envy or ambi|tion could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, though it was evi|dent that I could not gratify &s;uch num|bers as applied, even if I was &s;o inclined, yet each affected to take offence; and the refu&s;al of impo&s;&s;ible reque&s;ts made me irreconcileable enemies: the competitors dropping their mutual animo&s;ities to join in combinations again&s;t me, for a di&s;ap|pointment of expectations contradictory in them&s;elves, and de&s;tructive of each other; and repre&s;enting every word and action of my life in &s;uch malignant co|lours, as made me an object of general dete&s;tation to the mi&s;guided multitude, who&s;e deare&s;t intere&s;ts and happine&s;s I was at the very time labouring to promote.</P>
<P>Severely as I felt the &s;ting of this in|gratitude, I bore it, while it affected my|&s;elf only; but when their virulence pre|&s;umed to ri&s;e from me to the Khaliff, I
<PB N="106" REF="112">
could &s;upport it no longer: but to pre|vent that wor&s;t misfortune which can be|fal a &s;overeign, the lo&s;s of his &s;ubjects' love, threw my&s;elf at his feet, and im|plored his permi&s;&s;ion to leave a court, where my be&s;t intentions had unhappily produced &s;o bad an effect.</P>
<P>Strong as the rea&s;ons were, with which I enforced this reque&s;t, the Khaliff thought his honour, as well as his regard, concerned not to grant it. He rai&s;ed me from the ground, and bidding me fear nothing, while he approved my conduct, prepared to make tho&s;e, who had thus pre&s;umed to oppo&s;e his plea&s;ure, feel the weight of his re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>But the con&s;equences which I fore&s;aw might attend this firmne&s;s, however fa|vourable to my&s;elf, and noble in its mo|tive, &s;truck me with horror. I repeated my &s;uit, therefore, in terms &s;o pre&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="107" REF="113">
that I, in a manner, extorted his compli|ance, again&s;t his inclination; and leaving my enemies to triumph in their &s;ucce&s;s, joined a body of troops, which the Khaliff was &s;ending to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Aladdin, king of Diarbee, who then waged a mo&s;t unequal war with the Sultan of Khouare&s;m.</P>
<P>Though the motives of the oppo&s;ition, to which I had thus fallen a &s;acrifice, and the means by which it had been carried on, were equally unju&s;t, candour obliges me to confe&s;s, in this cool moment of deli|berate reflection, that my own indi&s;cretion a&s;&s;i&s;ted it, in too many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Secure of the &s;upport of the Khaliff's favour, I &s;lighted public opinion, and thought it beneath me to pay regard to appearances, as my intentions were right; eager for the accompli&s;hment of which, I never &s;tudied a proper &s;ea&s;on; but ob|truding them abruptly, without attention
<PB N="108" REF="114">
to circum&s;tances, provoked oppo&s;ition, by injudicious precipitancy, where mode&s;t de|licacy and caution would have obviated every objection, and en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, that the Khaliff him&s;elf had not al&s;o given &s;omething too like rea&s;on for the clamours rai&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>While he devoted all his thoughts to the cultivation of the finer arts, and mo|ral reformation of his people, the mo&s;t important affairs of the &s;tate either lan|gui&s;hed in neglect, or mi&s;carried in the attempt of conducting them by the rules of private virtue. From too lively a &s;en&s;e of the evils of war, he &s;acrificed the in|tere&s;ts of his people and the honour of his crown to pre&s;erve peace; and mercy, in|di&s;criminately di&s;pen&s;ed, robbed the laws of re&s;pect, and encouraged crimes, by taking away the fear of puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115">One advantage, it is true, I received from this &s;econd di&s;appointment, which was that of being convinced by the un|erring proof of experience, that as power, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, does not always pro|cure happine&s;s, in the &s;econd it is always unhappy; for, if the pillow of a prince is &s;ometimes unea&s;y, that of a favourite is ever filled with thorns; all the troubles of the former being aggravated to the latter, by anxiety at the uncertainty of his &s;ituation.</P>

<P>THE pain I felt at leaving a court, where I had thought my&s;elf &s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed, was in &s;ome degree alleviated by re&s;entment, and hope of acquiring &s;uch glory in the war as &s;hould dazzle my ene|mies at my return; and rai&s;e me above danger of &s;uffering the like di&s;grace again, e&s;pecially as I re&s;olved never more to give
<PB N="110" REF="116">
offence by attempting to &s;erve people again&s;t their inclinations.</P>
<P>The Khaliff di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with the warme&s;t a&s;&s;urances of regard. He had offered me the command of his troops; but a &s;en&s;e of my inexperience in the art of war made me decline &s;o difficult a charge, till I &s;hould be more equal to it.</P>
<P><Q>And yet,</Q> interrupted Temugin, <Q>equal inexperience in the arts of govern|ment had not made you decline that charge. Pre&s;umptuous folly! To think it ea&s;ier to govern a whole people in idlene&s;s, and in a manner free from re|&s;traint, and conduct the complicated affairs of peace; than to command a &s;mall part of them, who are prepared to obey; and direct them to a particular end, however difficult to attain, on which they are them&s;elves all intent!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117">I acknowledge, mighty lord, the ju&s;|tice of your reprehen&s;ion, returned the captive; but &s;uch is the confidence of man in his own abilities, where it is not re&s;trained by the obvious nece&s;&s;ity of ob|&s;erving &s;ome particular method, of which practice only can make him ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>No one attempts the &s;imple&s;t works of mechani&s;m, who has not practi&s;ed the manner; but all think them&s;elves born with abilities to govern.</P>
<P><Q>Proceed,</Q> replied Temugin; <Q>I re|prehend not thee. The fault is in hu|man nature.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had joined the army of Aladdin, re&s;umed the captive, I applied my&s;elf with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity to learn the military art, which I had an opportu|nity of &s;eeing in all its various extent; the war, in which he was engaged, call|ing
<PB N="112" REF="118">
forth all the re&s;ources of his genius and courage, to balance the &s;uperiority of the Sultan's forces.</P>
<P>The manner in which I had parted from the Khaliff had made me flatter my|&s;elf, that his regard for me was unalter|ably fixed; but I &s;oon had rea&s;on to change my opinion.</P>
<P>He had ordered me to &s;end him con|&s;tant accounts of all the events of the war; but to the&s;e I never received the lea&s;t re|turn; and to remove all doubt of the rea&s;on of &s;uch a &s;light, I &s;aw one of my mo&s;t malignant enemies appointed to the command of the troops in which I &s;erved; though, on the death of the former gene|ral, I had &s;olicited that tru&s;t, my abilities for which could not now be doubted.</P>
<P>This was an indignity I could not bear. In the angui&s;h of my &s;oul, therefore, I threw my&s;elf at the feet of Aladdin, and
<PB N="113" REF="119">
informing him of my &s;ituation, implored his protection, and leave to &s;erve in his own troops.</P>
<P>That vigilant and di&s;cerning prince, who was not a &s;tranger to the character of any &s;oldier in his armies, readily granted my &s;uit; and as, in &s;uch a &s;cene of conti|nued action, I could not long want an opportunity of proving my abilities, I &s;oon aro&s;e to the highe&s;t rank in his forces.</P>
<P>I had ju&s;tified the good opinion, which rai&s;ed me to the command of a &s;eparate army, by &s;everal &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, when a tempe&s;t and hurricane bur&s;t upon me, one day, as I was on a march, and over|whelmed the greater part of my troops.</P>
<P>As this was an accident, which no hu|man precaution could prevent, I did not apprehend that it could po&s;&s;ibly be im|puted to me as a fault; and therefore &s;ent
<PB N="114" REF="120">
directly to inform Aladdin of my misfor|tune, and de&s;ire a reinforcement.</P>
<P>But he viewed the matter in a different light; and &s;ending another general to take the command from me, let me know that it was a maxim with him, never to em|ploy again an officer who had once been unfortunate.</P>
<P><Q>Impious ab&s;urdity!</Q> exclaimed Te|mugin; <Q>to &s;et his own will in oppo&s;ition to that of heaven, and pretend to make man accountable for its actions! How could he expect that his &s;oldiers &s;hould &s;erve him, with the attachment and con|fidence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s, when they were liable thus to lo&s;e the merit of their be&s;t endeavours, without being guilty of any fault?</Q></P>
<P>And yet, mighty lord, returned the captive, it is in order to keep up that con|fidence, that he practi&s;es &s;uch &s;everity.
<PB N="115" REF="121">
<Q>Such is the force of &s;uper&s;titious opi|nion!</Q> I have heard him &s;ay, <Q>that the &s;oldier who &s;erves under a commander who has once been unfortunate, always fears misfortune; whereas, under one who has ever been &s;ucce&s;sful, he ru&s;hes on his enemy, with an a&s;&s;urance of the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, which is the mo&s;t certain means of obtaining it.</Q></P>
<P>As to the particular inju&s;tice of &s;uch a conduct, that never enters into his con&s;i|deration. Where the mind is wholly taken up with one object, it mea&s;ures the propriety of any means only by their apti|tude to procure it.</P>
<P>Aladdin not only gives the &s;tricte&s;t at|tention to the general welfare and intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects, but al&s;o relieves the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and promotes the happine&s;s of every individual with paternal tenderne&s;s and care.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="122">But this is, where this di&s;tre&s;s or hap|pine&s;s does not interfere with the opera|tions of the war, the immediate and great object of all his thoughts. Where they do, the tenderne&s;s and ju&s;tice of the king, and father of his people, are drowned in the political views and &s;everity of the &s;ol|dier and &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>Thus, while his &s;ubjects at home live in happine&s;s and &s;afety under the protec|tion of his care, his &s;oldiers are obliged to dive&s;t them&s;elves of every natural prin|ciple of action, and execute his orders, like mere machines, without regard to circum&s;tances; or any &s;en&s;e, but that of obedience to his will: a &s;tate of &s;ubjec|tion, which nothing but the hope of ac|celerating by victory their return to the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, &s;o profu&s;ely enjoyed under him, can make &s;upportable to be|ings, whom rea&s;on invariably directs to act with a regard to their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123"><Q>Cea&s;e your reflections,</Q> replied Te|mugin, <Q>and proceed with your &s;tory. Aladdin is a wi&s;e prince.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN I had recovered from my fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, continued the captive, I humbled my heart before heaven; and &s;eeking in my&s;elf for the cau&s;e of &s;o many misfortunes, was not at a lo&s;s to attribute them to my having delayed to return to my father; and immediately re&s;olved to turn my face homewards, nor &s;top till I &s;hould throw my&s;elf at his feet, and ob|tain his forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution bani&s;hed every repining and re&s;entful thought, and re&s;tored &s;ere|nity to my mind. I directly &s;et out on my journey, accompanied only by one atten|dant, who&s;e affectionate attachment I could not elude, &s;o as to depart alone, as
<PB N="118" REF="124">
I would have done; and through innu|merable difficulties and dangers, at length reached the habitation of my father.</P>
<P>My joy aro&s;e &s;o high, as I approached this &s;eat of innocence and content, that I could &s;carce &s;upport its emotions. It may be judged then what I felt, on find|ing his hou&s;e de&s;erted, and learning from his neighbours that he had di&s;appeared, in a few days after my departure, nor had ever been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>I &s;unk into a &s;woon, from which I re|covered only to &s;uffer the tortures of a violent fever, into which the workings of my &s;oul had inflamed my whole frame.</P>
<P>The care of my faithful attendant &s;aved my life; but I langui&s;hed many moons, in more than infantine weakne&s;s; nor was it even in the power of his friend&s;hip to heal the angui&s;h of my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125">At length, when youth had triumphed over the effects of my di&s;ea&s;e, a ray of delu&s;ive hope dawned upon me, that I might yet find my father. I recollected, that when I was learning my military exerci&s;es, he had &s;hewn a mo&s;t anxious alarm at my expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;eek experience in the art of war, and u&s;ed every argument to check the military ardour with which I &s;eemed to be fired.</P>
<P>This in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted a thought, that he might have concluded I had gone to &s;ome of the armies engaged in war, and accordingly pur&s;ued me.</P>
<P>As I had already &s;een the armies of Bagdat and Diarbee, I thought it in vain to &s;eek him among them; and therefore re|&s;olved to repair directly to the camp of the Sultan of Khourae&s;m, never reflecting on the improbability of finding an ob&s;cure old man among the innumerable multi|tudes collected in &s;uch a place, or of
<PB N="120" REF="126">
his having continued there &s;o long, even if he had gone thither at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I accordingly mea&s;ured back the weary &s;teps of my late journey, accompanied by my faithful friend; and proceeded thro' Per&s;ian Irac into the country of Tran&s;|oxana, where I joined the army of Mo|hammed, who&s;e evil genius had led him thither to oppo&s;e his force to your's.</P>
<P>But a fruitle&s;s &s;earch at length &s;hewed me the folly of &s;uch a vain undertaking; though I &s;till knew not how to give it up, as it was the la&s;t re&s;ource of my hope of ever &s;eeing my father more.</P>
<P>As I was wandering one day through the camp, buried in the&s;e painful reflec|tions, the leader of a band of &s;oldiers hap|pening to take notice of me, enquired who I was; and turning the hone&s;t an|&s;wer which I gave him into brutal ridi|cule,
<PB N="121" REF="127">
ordered me to be enrolled directly among the troops under his command.</P>
<P>It was in vain to expo&s;tulate. I was dragged away, amid the cruelties and in|&s;ults of tho&s;e unfeeling wretches, who fallen beneath humanity them&s;elves, take a malignant plea&s;ure in aggravating the mi&s;eries of others; and thrown into a dungeon to prevent my attempting to e&s;cape, till they &s;hould go upon action.</P>
<P>Every new misfortune &s;eems heavier than the pa&s;t. I thought of nothing now, but the horrors of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, among the &s;evere&s;t of which I reckoned the lo&s;s of my faithful companion, who had happened to be ab&s;ent from me, when I was &s;eized; nor had I any po&s;&s;ibility of letting him know where I was.</P>
<P>When I had lain &s;ome days in a con|finement, the loath&s;omene&s;s and &s;everity
<PB N="122" REF="128">
of which were &s;ufficient to break the &s;tronge&s;t health and &s;pirits, I went with the forces into the field, where hope of ending my &s;ufferings, by an honourable death, prompted me to behave in a man|ner, that attracted the notice of the com|mander, and removed all &s;u&s;picion of my de&s;iring to quit the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On my return to the camp, I &s;ought my companion, with the mo&s;t anxious care, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than had attended my &s;earch for my father.</P>
<P>My &s;pirit &s;unk under &s;uch accumulated di&s;appointments. I re&s;olved to return to Himilco; and &s;eclude my&s;elf from a world, who&s;e ways I de&s;paired of ever being able to reconcile to tho&s;e principles, by which I had been taught to believe it governed.</P>
<P>While I was con&s;idering how to accom|pli&s;h my e&s;cape, the day arrived, which
<PB N="123" REF="129">
was to determine the &s;overeign of the world.</P>
<P>Dete&s;tation of every thing which had the remote&s;t appearance of cowardice, would not permit me to leave the army at &s;uch a time. I therefore engaged in a cau&s;e, in which even my wi&s;hes were not intere&s;ted; and having been entru&s;ted with a &s;ubordi|nate command, for I had carefully con|cealed my having &s;erved in the armies of Aladdin, I lo&s;t my liberty in the execution of my duty, and now expect my fate from the &s;overeign of mankind.</P>

<P>THE circum&s;tances of this &s;tory made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Te|mugin, that he remained wrapt in thought for &s;ome time, after the captive had con|cluded.</P>
<P>Recollecting him&s;elf at length, <Q>Though thy days have been but few,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the vici&s;&s;itudes of thy life have been &s;uf|ficient to give thee the experience of many years.

<P>Such conde&s;cending goodne&s;s over|powered the grateful heart of Selim. He pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the feet of the empe|ror,
<PB N="125" REF="131">
and embracing his knees, a&s;&s;ured him of his mo&s;t faithful attachment.</P>
<P>Though Temugin's late victory, had &s;o totally broken the &s;pirit of &s;ultan Mo|hammed, that he never after dared to face him in the field, his &s;on, Gelaleddin, made &s;uch noble efforts to retrieve his affairs, as &s;eemed for &s;ome time to keep the event doubtful.</P>
<P>While the emperor, therefore, was tak|ing he nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for reduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an enemy, who&s;e activity and enterprize ren|dered him &s;till more formidable, than the number of his forces, he received infor|mation of the revolt of one of his newly conquered kingdoms, in which a con&s;ider|able body of his own troops had joined.</P>
<P>Such an event demanded in&s;tant atten|tion. The example might be followed by others; and the reduction attended with more difficulty than the fir&s;t conque&s;t; as
<PB N="126" REF="132">
de&s;pair always &s;trengthens the hand of rebellion.</P>
<P>The account had arrived ju&s;t as Selim had fini&s;hed the &s;tory of his life. In a moment the whole camp was in motion; and the ri&s;ing &s;un found Temugin in full march, at the head of a body of forces, equal to the occa&s;ion, which he held not of importance &s;ufficient to require his whole army.</P>
<P>In &s;uch general commotions, private individuals are ea&s;ily overlooked. Selim had received no orders to attend the empe|ror; but he deemed it his duty; and re|&s;olved to keep as near to his per&s;on as po&s;|&s;ible, in hope of &s;ome happy opportunity of proving in his &s;ight, that he was not unworthy of the favour which had been &s;hewn him.</P>
<P>The army of Temugin had &s;carce en|tered the country of the rebels, when
<PB N="127" REF="133">
they daringly advanced to meet him. The battle was ob&s;tinate and bloody. As Te|mugin was ha&s;ting to &s;upport one of the wings of his army, which was beginning to give way, he found him&s;elf unexpect|edly &s;urrounded by a band of the rebels, who knowing his per&s;on, had made a de&s;|perate effort to take him pri&s;oner: but though he &s;aw all his attendants cut to pieces, he di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to &s;uch in|dignity. He &s;tood re&s;olutely on his de|fence; and like a lion fallen into a pit, &s;acrificed to his revenge, every one, who dared to come within his reach, till he was ju&s;t &s;inking under fatigue, and lo&s;s of blood; when, in the important moment, which &s;eparates life from death, a &s;ingle &s;oldier broke through the croud, and throw|ing him&s;elf before him, with a loud &s;hout, exerted efforts of &s;uch uncommon valour in his defence, as kept the enemy off, till a body of troops, whom he had apprized of the emperor's danger, and who had
<PB N="128" REF="134">
followed him, as clo&s;e as they could, came to his relief.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t &s;truggle which the rebels made for victory. As &s;oon as the battle was ended, the fir&s;t care of Temu|gin was to find his deliverer, whom he had known, amid&s;t all the tumults of &s;uch a &s;cene.</P>
<P>On the &s;oldier's advancing through the croud of princes and commanders, who had gathered round the emperor to expre&s;s their joy at his &s;afety, and congratulate him on the victory, which had crowned his arms, <Q>Take this,</Q> &s;aid he, reaching him his own &s;word, <Q>&s;on of Abudah, as a pledge of my e&s;teem; and a&s;k any boon which your heart wi&s;heth, in re|ward of your fidelity and valour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Conqueror of the world,</Q> replied Se|lim, throwing him&s;elf at the emperor's
<PB N="129" REF="135">
feet, <Q>my heart's fir&s;t wi&s;h is to lay down with glory, in your &s;ervice, that life which you have ble&s;&s;ed with liberty. The bare performance of duty merits not reward.</Q></P>
<P>The emperor then turning to one of his chieftains, <Q>Go,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>put all the captives to the &s;word; let loo&s;e the rage of war upon the country; nor leave a &s;oul alive to pre&s;erve the name of &s;uch a people upon the face of the earth! The world &s;hall &s;ee the con&s;equence of re|belling again&s;t my power.</Q></P>

<P>THE chief was ju&s;t departing to put the&s;e orders in execution, when Selim &s;tepped forward, and pro&s;trating him&s;elf again, at the emperor's feet, <Q>Revoke the dreadful &s;entence,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O &s;ub|&s;titute of heaven! and imitate his mercy who hath given you his power.</Q></P>
<P>All pre&s;ent were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;h|ment and affright, at a pre&s;umption never attempted before; the word of the empe|ror being held as &s;acred as the will of heaven.</P>
<P>Temugin &s;tarted; and looking furiou&s;ly on Selim, as he lay trembling with eager|ne&s;s and anxiety at his feet, 'How!' &s;aid he; <Q>dare&s;t thou to doubt the ju&s;tice of my commands? To interpo&s;e thy&s;elf between rebellion and my vengeance?
<PB N="131" REF="137">
Beware, ra&s;h youth; &s;uch a crime, even in thought, cancels all merit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Never &s;hall a thought of his &s;lave,</Q> returned Selim, <Q>give offence to my lord. I revere thy irre&s;i&s;tible power; and &s;hrink to nothing before thy wrath: but O, hearken to the words of thy &s;lave. Let the guilty, but the guilty only, &s;uffer: infants are incapable of rebellion; and weakne&s;s &s;inks the woman and old age equally beneath vengeance. Let the innocent live to witne&s;s the puni&s;h|ment of the guilty. The dead obey no more! nor does a de&s;olated country yield laurels to adorn the victor's brow.</Q></P>
<P>The words of Selim &s;unk into the em|peror's heart. He &s;tood, &s;ome moments, buried in thought; then, &s;oftening the rage which glowed in his looks, 'Ari&s;e,' &s;aid he, <Q>I will &s;hew you that my word is irrevocable. I bade you a&s;k a boon! You have a&s;ked; and &s;hall obtain it.
<PB N="132" REF="138">
Go! take under your command the troops of Ca&s;bin; and execute my ven|geance according to the rules of that ju&s;tice, in favour of which you have ventured to plead &s;o &s;trongly.</Q></P>
<P>Such a charge exceeded even the hopes of Selim. He bowed his head to the ground, in te&s;timony of obedience; and ri&s;ing, departed in&s;tantly to execute a command, which gratified the deare&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of his heart.</P>
<P>Putting him&s;elf, therefore, at the head of the forces a&s;&s;igned to him, he flew directly to &s;top the carnage, always com|mitted in the fir&s;t heat of victory; and gathering all the captives into one body, he &s;urrounded them with a guard, not more to prevent their e&s;cape, than to pro|tect them from farther injury; having done which, he directed his march to the capital, taking them along with him.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="139">As the rea&s;on of the emperor's confer|ring this command upon Selim, was as yet known but to few, it was thought he had thus &s;aved the lives of the captives for the pre&s;ent, only to &s;trike the greater terror, by putting them to death in the &s;ight of their families and friends; for mercy to rebels was a thing unheard of.</P>
<P>But he &s;uffered them not to remain long in an opinion &s;o injurious to his intentions. As &s;oon as he arrived before the capital, he ordered all the pri&s;oners to be led forth; and advancing toward them, as they &s;tood trembling with &s;u&s;pen&s;e and horror, <Q>The fir&s;t orders of the emperor's ju&s;t wrath,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>were to exterminate a people, who had dared to rebel again&s;t him; but his mercy hath interpo&s;ed; and his ju&s;tice now ordains, that the guilty only &s;hall &s;uffer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let the&s;e therefore be pointed out! Who were the fir&s;t inciters to this rebellion? what pretext was feigned? what end propo&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="140">
to encourage it? He is unworthy to lead in any cau&s;e, who will not &s;tand be|tween his followers and de&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;poken the&s;e words, when a confu&s;ed noi&s;e announced the arrival of the king of this unhappy people. He ap|peared to have pa&s;t the middle &s;tage of man's life; but to have &s;uffered more from misfortune than from time. A ray of native maje&s;ty &s;hot through the gloom of grief, which overca&s;t his looks. He was arrayed in the garb of mourning; and the en&s;igns of royalty were borne rever&s;ed before him.</P>
<P>At his approach, all was &s;till as death. On being informed of what Selim had &s;aid, a gleam of joy fla&s;hed over his face. He &s;tepped forward, and with an air of dignity and re&s;olution, <Q>Behold, O worthy &s;ub&s;titute of the conqueror of the world,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>the man, whom you &s;eek! I was the king of this unhappy people;
<PB N="135" REF="141">
and on my head mu&s;t fall the puni&s;h|ment of their mi&s;doings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He was not the author of the revolt! He led not the people to battle,</Q> ex|claimed a youth, breaking through the croud of captives, who &s;trove in vain to re&s;train him: <Q>That crime, &s;ince heaven hath declared it &s;uch by the event, was mine; and I alone de&s;erve to die for it.</Q></P>
<P>'Away! ra&s;h boy!' returned the ve|nerable monarch; <Q>nor add thy di&s;obe|dience to the number of my griefs. Would&s;t thou u&s;urp the rights of thy king? for who, but their king, can be an&s;werable for his people?</Q></P>
<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Selim, <Q>If I was not the immediate author of the revolt,</Q> he continued, <Q>I &s;trove not to &s;uppre&s;s it! If he led the people to bat|tle, it was in the authority of my name, and with my a&s;&s;ent. What was a crime
<PB N="136" REF="142">
therefore in me, was only a duty in him; nor would it be con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;|tice you propo&s;e, to let the &s;on &s;uffer for doing that which his &s;overeign and his father did not forbid him to do.</Q></P>

<P>SELIM li&s;tened with equal plea&s;ure and &s;urprize, to a conte&s;t which did ho|nour to the human name. But it was far from being &s;o plea&s;ing to all pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The troops, at the head of which the emperor had placed him, were com|manded, under him, by Cafor, the chief|tain, again&s;t whom the rebellion had fir&s;t been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>As Selim was proceeding to inter|po&s;e between the father and the &s;on, he was interrupted by Cafor, who ju&s;t then joined him: <Q>Let the in&s;tant deaths of both,</Q> &s;aid he &s;ternly, <Q>put
<PB N="137" REF="143">
an end to their audacious conte&s;t. It were trea&s;on to &s;hew mercy to traitors.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And can&s;t thou doom us to death,</Q> returned the youth, trembling with indig|nant rage, <Q>for that which thy inju&s;tice alone compelled us to do? For &s;eeking redre&s;s of wrongs, too great for human nature to &s;ubmit to?</Q></P>
<P>'What can this mean?' interrupted Selim. <Q>What wrongs do&s;t thou com|plain of? and who&s;e inju&s;tice was the cau&s;e of thy rebellion? Speak in the boldne&s;s of truth, and expect ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>'Our wrongs, O gracious chieftain,' replied the prince, melting into tears, at the tenderne&s;s which &s;hone in the looks of Selim, <Q>are too many to be recited in a moment; and the perpetrator too mighty for me to contend with. You &s;ee before you, two of the mo&s;t mi&s;er|able of men, made &s;o by him, who
<PB N="138" REF="144">
&s;tands in the &s;ecurity of power, at your right hand. The inju&s;tice of Cafor was the cau&s;e of our crime. Again&s;t that only, not again&s;t the &s;overeignty of Temugin, did we revolt! And if thou wilt but &s;weeten death, with an hope that our wrongs &s;hall be avenged upon his head, this moment will I meet it with joy, in any form which his own cruelty can pre&s;cribe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Shall the power of Temugin be thus in&s;ulted?</Q> exclaimed Cafor, <Q>and his vengeance delayed by the vain words of a &s;lave? Give them to death, the hoary traitor and his rebellious &s;on! Give them in&s;tantly to the death which their ac|knowledged guilt de&s;erves; nor let the honour of our &s;overeign be longer trifled with in this manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Son of A&s;hur,</Q> returned Selim, <Q>the power of our mighty lord &s;hall not be in&s;ulted; nor his vengeance delayed
<PB N="139" REF="145">
longer, than is nece&s;&s;ary for putting it under the direction of ju&s;tice, by which alone the honour of a &s;overeign is &s;upported.</Q></P>
<P>Then turning to the captive prince, <Q>Thy accu&s;ation,</Q> he continued, <Q>falls upon a re&s;pected head; and mu&s;t be &s;upported by the cleare&s;t proof, or it will recoil with tenfold force upon thy|&s;elf! But let not this di&s;courage thee to &s;peak the words of truth. Ju&s;tice knoweth no di&s;tinction of per&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P>Emboldened by this a&s;&s;urance, the prince pau&s;ed for a few moments, then rai&s;ing his eyes &s;lowly from the ground, and fixing them with the mode&s;t confi|dence of innocence upon Selim, <Q>O &s;hadow of him, who rules the world,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>I obey thy command; and will unfold our griefs as far as nature is able to give them utterance, depending upon
<PB N="140" REF="146">
thy compa&s;&s;ion to pardon the incohe|rencies of di&s;traction and de&s;pair.</Q></P>
<Q><P>This unhappy land, now doomed to &s;uffer all the mi&s;eries of war, has flou|ri&s;hed, for a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, under the government of my ance&s;tors, who all placed their glory in the happi|ne&s;s of their people.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t hour of his reign, my father trod invariably in their &s;acred &s;teps; and, in order to train me in the &s;ame, admitted me into his councils, and made room for me on his throne, as &s;oon as rea&s;on had gained &s;ufficient &s;trength to imitate the example he &s;et me.</P>
<P>How far I an&s;wered his hopes, is not for me to &s;ay. He &s;eemed to be plea&s;ed; and I was happy.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="147">In this manner my age had numbered two hundred moons, when the power of Temugin began to &s;hake the world.</P>
<P>In the ardour of inexperienced youth, I would have oppo&s;ed his victorious arms, and defended the throne of my ance&s;tors; but the wi&s;dom of my father re&s;trained my ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<Q><P>Would&s;t thou &s;top the flowing of the &s;ea? he &s;aid. Can the breath of thy mouth repel the &s;torm? It is a duty to yield, where re&s;i&s;tance is without hope.</P>
<P>My people may be as happy under another &s;overeign, nor will I expo&s;e them to de&s;truction to pre&s;erve upon my head a crown, which I have always con&s;idered to have been given to me, as much for their advantage, as my own.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="148">I will re&s;ign my&s;elf, therefore, to the will of heaven, without repining. I will &s;ubmit to the conqueror. Ambition is often accompanied by genero&s;ity.

<Q><P>THE will of my father had ever been the rule of my actions. I obeyed without reply. The con&s;equence was that which he had fore&s;een. Temugin not only confirmed him on his throne; but al&s;o honoured him with his parti|cular confidence and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149">Impelled by gratitude, I offered him my &s;ervice, in his wars, at the head of a body of our cho&s;en youth. My offer was accepted, and our &s;ervice approved on many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But this happine&s;s was of &s;hort dura|tion. The kings of the neighbouring nations, who, uninfluenced by the &s;ame principles of wi&s;dom and virtue, as my father, had attempted to re&s;i&s;t the conque|ror, found not the &s;ame favour from him&punc; When he turned his arms to di&s;tant con|que&s;ts, therefore, he committed the government of their kingdoms to one of his commanders, leaving him an army to enforce that obedience, which, he was &s;en&s;ible, depended upon force alone.</P>
<P>Though my father's kingdom could not have been included in this charge, as the emperor had, from the fir&s;t, re|in&s;tated him in all the powers of royalty, and I was in his armies, as a pledge for
<PB N="144" REF="150">
his faith, the avarice of this commander levelled all di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the tide of the empe|ror's conque&s;ts led him afar off, than he entered our country, in an ho&s;tile manner, and under the pretext of di&s;|arming the inhabitants, who made no re&s;i&s;tance, plundered them with the mo&s;t in&s;atiable rapacity, of the acqui&s;i|tions of ages of indu&s;try and peace.</P>
<P>Surprized at &s;uch an outrage, my father attempted to expo&s;tulate with the invader; but in&s;tead of paying regard to his words, he affected to treat his very expo&s;tulation as rebellion; and march|ing directly to the capital of his king|dom, entered, as in conque&s;t, gates which were opened to him in the con|fidence of peace, and deprived him of every &s;hadow of power.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="151">Nor did he &s;top there. The wealth of which he had &s;poiled the country, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying, had only heightened his avarice. He thought the Prince mu&s;t be per&s;onally rich, in proportion to the riches of his people. He therefore &s;eized the trea&s;ures of the crown; and not finding them to an&s;wer his expecta|tions, concluded that they had been &s;ecreted from his &s;earch: for my father looking upon his &s;ubjects as his mo&s;t faithful &s;tewards, had ever &s;corned the prepo&s;terous policy of ama&s;&s;ing wealth which he did not immediately want, and knew would encrea&s;e in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>Enraged at this di&s;appointment, he &s;trove to intimidate my father, by threats, to a di&s;covery which was not in his power to make; but finding them in|effectual, he&mdash;that man&mdash;whom, to my di&s;honour, I behold alive&mdash;that Cafor &mdash;accur&s;ed be his name&mdash;dared to carry
<PB N="146" REF="152">
his threats into execution; and loading him with many &s;tripes, &s;hed his &s;acred blood by the ignominious hand of the executioner.</P>
<P>Obedience to my father had made his people &s;ubmit to their own &s;ufferings; but his they could not bear. They aro&s;e like one man. They delivered him from the hands of the tyrant, who ba&s;ely &s;aved him&s;elf by flight.</P>
<P>The army, in which I &s;erved, was not far di&s;tant. I &s;oon heard the dreadful tidings, and flew to my father, followed by my faithful friends. I would have avenged his wrongs, but I was not able. I could not even die in the ju&s;t attempt.</P>
<P>Thus, mighty commander, have I &s;hewn thee the cau&s;e of our revolt. I confe&s;s my guilt. I have fought again&s;t my &s;overeign, to &s;ave my father. Let me alone &s;uffer for my crime; but be|fore
<PB N="147" REF="153">
I do &s;uffer, I claim thy promi&s;e of ju&s;tice upon the author of that crime.</P>
<P>Prove the truth of my charge by every torture which he can invent; but let his puni&s;hment follow the proof, and I &s;hall die happy.</P></Q>

<P>IT was not without difficulty that Se|lim could prevent Cafor from frequent|ly interrupting the captive prince in the cour&s;e of his narrative. As &s;oon as it was ended, he turned to the accu&s;ed, with a cool, but determined look, and de|manded what defence he could make again&s;t &s;o black a charge.</P>
<P>'This &s;hall defend me,' an&s;wered Ca|for, in a rage, brandi&s;hing his &s;abre over his head; <Q>I di&s;dain to &s;ubmit to any other deci&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154">'O, let the &s;word decide it!' exclaimed the prince eagerly. <Q>Strong though his arm, the ju&s;tice of heaven is &s;till &s;tronger. Let the &s;word decide it, this moment.</Q></P>
<P>'We need not refer to heaven,' returned Selim, <Q>for the deci&s;ion of that which human rea&s;on can decide. When ap|peals to the &s;word are admitted, obedi|ence to the laws is at an end. Every man is then the &s;overeign arbiter of his own cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Then turning to Cafor, 'Son of A&s;hur,' he continued, <Q>&s;ince thou can&s;t not refute the atrocious charge brought again&s;t thee, take the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of thy guilt.</Q>&mdash;Saying which, he made a &s;ignal to his &s;oldiers, who in&s;tantly &s;mote off the head of Cafor, and laid it at his feet.</P>
<P>The tumult, occa&s;ioned by this unex|pected event, had no &s;ooner &s;ub&s;ided, than
<PB N="149" REF="155">
Selim, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the king, who had &s;tood all this time in the &s;tupefaction of grief before him, <Q>To thee, O injured monarch,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the ju&s;tice of Te|mugin hath rendered this redre&s;s; and now rein&s;tates thee in all the rights of that &s;overeignty, of which thou ha&s;t been &s;o unworthily deprived. Re&s;tore tran|quillity and order among your people; puni&s;h pa&s;t crimes, to prevent the repe|tition of them; and compleat your own glory, by compleating the happine&s;s of your &s;ubjects.

<P>Then rai&s;ing the prince, who lay at his feet, panting in an exta&s;y of gratitude and joy, <Q>As for your fate,</Q> he continued, <Q>it mu&s;t be determined by the word of our &s;overeign. He commanded me to pu|ni&s;h the authors of this revolt. How far you may be included in that com|mand, is for him&s;elf to &s;ay. Be not,
<PB N="150" REF="156">
however, di&s;mayed. He will weigh the cau&s;e again&s;t the crime, and pay ju&s;t re|gard to the fir&s;t of human duties.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;ignal in&s;tance of ju&s;tice re&s;tored peace to the country. Satisfied at &s;eeing the wrongs of their &s;overeign redre&s;&s;ed, the people forgot their own, and readily returned to their duty; while their hap|pine&s;s &s;ecured their continuance in it.</P>
<P>On Selim's return, he threw him&s;elf at the feet of Temugin, to render an account of his charge. The fate of Cafor had reached the camp before him, and the emperor had not di&s;clo&s;ed his &s;entiments upon it. All therefore waited with anxiety for the event.</P>
<P>The emperor having heard him with unmoved attention, as &s;oon as he had ended, 'The heart of man,' &s;aid he, look|ing around him with an air of maje&s;ty,

<P>Then directing him&s;elf to the prince, who lay pro&s;trate before him, 'Ari&s;e,' he continued, <Q>and re&s;ume your command in my armies. I war not again&s;t nature!</Q></P>

<P>THE exalted &s;tation to which Tog|rul (for by that name was he now known) was thus rai&s;ed, gave, for &s;ome time, &s;uch employment to his mind, that he &s;carce thought of his former misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>But this re&s;pite was not long. No &s;ooner had the fir&s;t tumults of youthful

joy and ambition &s;ub&s;ided, than all his grief returned with aggravated weight; and he upbraided him&s;elf for having &s;uf|fered it to be &s;u&s;pended, even for a moment, by the &s;miles of a pro&s;perity, which he con&s;idered as acquired at the lo&s;s of his father, and not to be enjoyed without the farther crime of violating his faith to the daughter of Himilco, now the &s;ole object of his hopes and wi&s;hes; to whom he ac|cordingly re&s;olved to return.</P>
<P>But a principle of gratitude would not permit him to carry this purpo&s;e into exe|cution, before he &s;hould, by &s;ome new &s;ervices, repay the debt he owed to Temu|gin, and prove him&s;elf not unworthy of the rank to which he was rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time Temugin, who was no &s;tranger to the leading pa&s;&s;ions of his heart, generou&s;ly re&s;olved to employ him in a &s;ervice, which &s;hould afford him the ample&s;t opportunity of indulging them.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="160">Calling for him therefore, one morn|ing, <Q>Togrul,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I know not in what light I am to hold the Khaliff of Bagdat; whether as an enemy, or a friend.

<PB N="156" REF="161">
&s;lights he had received from the Khaliff, the malignancy of his enemies, and the opportunity of revenge now in his power, fla&s;hed in&s;tantly upon him, and &s;et every pa&s;&s;ion of his heart in conflict.</P>
<P>Pro&s;trating him&s;elf at the feet of the emperor, <Q>I acknowledge,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>mighty lord, the honour conferred upon me by this important tru&s;t, and will endeavour to acquit my&s;elf of it to your &s;atisfaction. But, O remember the trial to which your &s;lave is expo&s;ed!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I &s;ee,</Q> interrupted the emperor, <Q>the workings of your &s;oul; but I doubt not your ability to &s;urmount &s;till greater trials. It is by &s;uch alone that virtue can be proved.</Q></P>
<P>The armies of Temugin were always in readine&s;s to carry his orders into in&s;tant execution. Togrul decamped at the fir&s;t
<PB N="157" REF="162">
hour of the evening, animated with an ardour, from which his forces drew the happie&s;t pre&s;ages of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As he pur&s;ued his march through the country of Far&s;i&s;tan, his attention was one day &s;truck by a pile of ruins, the magni|ficence of which tempted him to take a nearer view of them, while his troops halted for refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The reflections, naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;uch &s;cenes, were interrupted by the &s;ight of an aged man, &s;itting in a melancholy po&s;ture, with his eyes intently fixed upon &s;ome fragments, which lay in an heap be|fore him, while a flood of tears rolled in &s;ilence down his furrowed cheeks.</P>
<P>Such a &s;ight was equally affecting to curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion. Advancing therefore toward him, 'Pardon,' &s;aid To|grul, <Q>O venerable father! the intru&s;ion
<PB N="158" REF="163">
of a &s;tranger, who wi&s;hes to know the cau&s;e of your di&s;tre&s;s, in hope it may be in his power to offer you relief.</Q></P>
<P>The mourner rai&s;ed his eyes, and look|ing eagerly around, <Q>Is the voice of benevolence heard again in this place?</Q> he exclaimed. <Q>Sweet is the &s;ound, tho' its purpo&s;e is impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P>Then fixing his eyes mo&s;t attentively upon Togrul for &s;ome moments, <Q>Your words, O illu&s;trious young man,</Q> he continued, <Q>&s;peak a feeling heart; and I &s;ee that you have already ta&s;ted of ad|ver&s;ity. I will therefore &s;atisfy your enquiry, though hopele&s;s of its motive; for, alas! my woes admit not of relief.</Q></P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he turned his face to the Ea&s;t, and pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the heap of fragments, <Q>O life of the univer&s;e!</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>thou glorious Sun!
<PB N="159" REF="164">
protect the&s;e &s;acred relicks from pollu|tion; nor give the a&s;hes of Zelis to the winds, before mine &s;hall be mingled with them.</Q></P>
<P>When he had offered up this prayer, he aro&s;e, and turning to Togrul, <Q>I have promi&s;ed to unfold to you the cau&s;e of my unhappine&s;s,</Q> he continued; <Q>but this place is improper. The voice of prayer and adoration only &s;hould be heard here. We will withdraw into the &s;hade of yon|der arch, and there I will relate the me|lancholy tale.</Q></P>
<P>As &s;oon as Togrul and he were &s;eated, 'The&s;e ruins,' &s;aid the mourner, with a &s;igh, which &s;eemed to bur&s;t his heart, <Q>are all which remains of the &s;acred Temple of the Sun; and in that &s;pot, now covered with tho&s;e fragments, once &s;tood the altar, on which my ance&s;tors, for ages without number, fed the ever|living
<PB N="160" REF="165">
fire, the hallowed emblem of his purity and power; till the divine wrath, kindled again&s;t the &s;ins of man|kind, gave up the world to the ravages of the Arabians, who not content with temporal dominion, dared to attack the &s;overeignty of heaven.</Q></P>
<Q><P>They polluted our temples; they over-turned our altars; and impiou&s;ly attempted to extingui&s;h the &s;acred fire, emblem of him who&s;e light had illumi|nated the world from its fir&s;t creation. An impiety never pre&s;umed before by any who had obtained dominion over us.</P>
<P>But heaven had not &s;o far abandoned the human race. Forewarned in a dream, one of our lineage had built an altar, in the mountains of Irac Agem; and &s;ecretly removed thither a &s;park of the true fire, before the &s;acrilegious ravagers reached this temple.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="166">The horrors of that day are not to be de&s;cribed. In vain did the prie&s;ts hold up their hands, never defiled with blood, never profaned with any in&s;trument of de&s;truction, to avert the rage of war from the&s;e holy walls. The tears of the mother, and the cries of her infants, pleaded in vain. The barbarians were equally deaf to innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>Then did the piety of our race &s;hine forth in all its glory. They gathered them&s;elves around the altar, and cover|ing it with their bodies, &s;aved the &s;acred fire from profanation by extingui&s;hing it with their blood, which was &s;hed without re&s;pect to age or &s;ex, and the temple reduced to this heap of ruins.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the con&s;ter|nation of the people at this fatal out|rage. Thinking the &s;acred fire utterly extingui&s;hed, they abandoned them&s;elves
<PB N="162" REF="167">
to de&s;pair, and every where courted the &s;words of their de&s;troyers.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;park, which had been pre&s;erved in Irac Agem, being di&s;covered, the poor remains of the true Per&s;ees, repaired to it; and pre|ferring tho&s;e inho&s;pitable mountains to the fertile plains of Far&s;i&s;tan, without this object of their wor&s;hip, built them&s;elves a little city, where their po&s;terity hath lived in peace to this day.</P>
<P>Of all our lineage, there had e&s;caped the general ma&s;&s;acre, only the one who attended the altar he had built in Irac Agem; and an infant daughter, borne to him by his &s;i&s;ter, at the lo&s;s of her own life, &s;oon after her arrival there.</P>
<P>The danger of lo&s;ing a race, &s;o long endeared to their love, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their religion, filled the Per&s;ees with the
<PB N="163" REF="168">
&s;tronge&s;t fear; but heaven heard their prayers, and from the&s;e two &s;prung a progeny which hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince; for never was our blood contaminated by mixture with any other, all our alli|ances being among our&s;elves, and in the neare&s;t relations of nature; a cu&s;tom by which we double the happine&s;s of life, in the union of all its endearments.</P>
<P>But though driven thus by irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity from our native land, once in our lives we never fail to vi&s;it the&s;e re|vered ruins, to implore from the Sun a re&s;toration of their glory; and &s;prinkle upon the remains of his altar the a&s;hes of our decea&s;ed kindred, which we reli|giou&s;ly pre&s;erve for that purpo&s;e; and this was the melancholy cau&s;e of my coming hither at this time.</P></Q>
<P>A flood of tears here choaked his ut|terance. He hung down his head, and &s;obbed aloud for &s;ome moments, while

<P>AS &s;oon as he had recovered the power of &s;peech, <Q>Were I not convinced of the benevolence of your heart,</Q> he re&s;umed, <Q>O virtuous youth! I &s;hould make an excu&s;e for paying a tribute to nature, which affected heroi&s;m has di&s;honoured with the name of weakne&s;s; but I &s;ee you are &s;uperior to &s;uch fal&s;e refine|ment.</Q></P>
<Q><P>This melancholy duty having fallen upon me this year, I yielded in an un|happy hour to the &s;ollicitations of my wife, to let her accompany me hither.</P>
<P>On the third day of our journey, we were met by a troop of Tartars, who had &s;eparated from the armies of Te|mugin,
<PB N="165" REF="170">
and ranged the country in &s;earch of plunder.</P>
<P>The innocence of our lives, and our known poverty in tho&s;e things which are called the riches of the world, had ever pre&s;erved us in peace with all the nations round. I advanced there|fore without fear to the leader of the troop, and informing him who we were, expected to have been permitted to pur|&s;ue our journey without interruption.</P>
<P>But alas! I flattered my&s;elf with vain expectation. He had looked at the beauty of my wife with eyes of de|&s;ire, and re&s;olved to tear her from my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Unwilling however to have recour&s;e to open violence, for fear of oppo&s;ition from his followers, who, he knew, held our people in the highe&s;t reverence, he
<PB N="166" REF="171">
pre&s;&s;ed us to take &s;helter in his tent from the heat of noon; a courte&s;y feigned, that he might have time to form &s;ome &s;cheme for accompli&s;hing his ba&s;e de&s;ign.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome offers, which, how|ever unacceptable, cannot be refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ees have ever been famed for ho&s;pitality, above all the nations upon earth. We could not refu&s;e entering his tent, without an appearance of un|&s;ocial ingratitude, though our laws would not permit us to ta&s;te a drop of water with him.</P>
<P>We had not been long there, when he withdrew, under a pretence of giving &s;ome orders to his men; nor returned till it was too late for us to reach the ca|ravan&s;era, in which we had propo&s;ed to re&s;t that night: for it would have been
<PB N="167" REF="172">
reckoned an infringement upon the laws of ho&s;pitality in us, to have departed without waiting for him.</P>
<P>Our unea&s;ine&s;s, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, may be well conceived; but he gave rea&s;ons of &s;uch plau&s;ibility for his ab|&s;ence, and offered &s;o courteou&s;ly to re|main where he was for that night, for our convenience, that we could not avoid complying to &s;tay with him.</P>
<P>His joy, at &s;eeing us run &s;o readily, as he thought, into his &s;nares, put him off his guard.</P>
<P>I caught a glance of his eye, as he gazed at my wife, in which I read the nefarious purpo&s;e of his heart. I aro&s;e, therefore, in&s;tantly, and claiming the &s;acred privilege of ho&s;pitality, proceeded that moment on my journey, along with my wife.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="173">The &s;hades of night falling upon us, as we travelled by the &s;ide of a wood, my wife was &s;o terrified by the roaring of the wild bea&s;ts, i&s;&s;uing from their dens in que&s;t of prey, that I was obliged to give way to her fears, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her to climb a lofty tree, where I placed her in &s;afety among the boughs, &s;eating my|&s;elf be&s;ide her.</P>
<P>The fears of my wife &s;eemed to have been impre&s;&s;ed by heaven, to &s;ave us from dangers &s;till more terrible than tho&s;e &s;he was afraid of.</P>
<P>We were &s;carcely &s;ettled in the tree, when we heard the tread of hor&s;es; and in a little time could di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of the Tartar, exultingly antici|pating to his followers the plea&s;ure he promi&s;ed him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my wife, as he pa&s;&s;ed by our place of refuge.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="174">The appearance of the morning at length giving us hope that our danger was over, we de&s;cended from the tree; and having offered up our adorations to the ri&s;ing &s;un, were preparing to pro|ceed in our journey, when we perceived our enemy approaching toward us on his return.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the horrors with which this &s;ight &s;truck us. My wife, in the vain impul&s;e of de&s;pair, ran toward the wood, whither the Tartar pur&s;ued her, while his companions &s;eized me.</P>
<P>Her flight was &s;oon &s;topped. The ravi&s;her overtook her, and mad with de&s;ire, attempted to gratify his brutal appetites upon the &s;pot. What were the &s;en&s;ations of my &s;oul in that dreadful moment! But heaven &s;aw my di&s;tre&s;s, and heard the cries of her innocence.</P></Q>

<Q><P>JUST as he had overpowered her re&s;i&s;tance, a lion, rouzed by her &s;hrieks, i&s;&s;ued from a brake, near to which heaven had directed her flight, and ru&s;h|ing upon the ruffian, tore him piece|meal in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Soon as my wife found her&s;elf freed from his violence, &s;he &s;tarted from the ground, and ran with out-&s;tretched arms towards me for protection, incapable of con&s;idering my inability to afford it, nor even &s;en&s;ible of the means of her deli|verance.</P>
<P>But the power, which had &s;o &s;ignally &s;aved her, continued his care of us both. The Tartars, who had &s;eized me, &s;truck with &s;o evident an interpo&s;ition of heaven, no &s;ooner &s;aw their leader &s;lain, than
<PB N="171" REF="176">
fearing a like fate for them&s;elves, as ac|complices in his guilt, they loo&s;ed their hold, and &s;pringing upon their hor&s;es, fled out of &s;ight in a moment.</P>
<P>The&s;e events had &s;ucceeded each other &s;o rapidly, that rea&s;on was unable to keep pace with them. I &s;tood &s;tupified with a&s;toni&s;hment, nor had power to advance to meet my wife, till &s;he fell motionle&s;s at my feet.</P>
<P>This &s;ight re&s;tored me to my&s;elf. I rai&s;ed her head, and laying it in my bo&s;om, attempted to &s;oothe her di&s;tre&s;s with words of comfort, which I wanted little le&s;s my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The generous lion, in the mean time, &s;tood over the victim of his ju&s;tice, growling with &s;avage delight, and la&s;h|ing his &s;ides with his tail, without ad|vancing a &s;ingle &s;tep towards us, though &s;o near him; till &s;atisfied with his
<PB N="172" REF="177">
triumph, he returned &s;lowly back to his den.</P>
<P>It was a con&s;iderable time before I could bring my wife to her &s;en&s;es. The conflict had been too violent for her ten|der frame. Her &s;pirits and &s;trength equally &s;unk under it: &s;unk, alas! never to recover. Several times &s;he opened her eyes, and fixed them wildly on me; then &s;tarting in the impre&s;&s;ion of her fright, gave a feeble &s;hriek, and &s;wooned away again.</P>
<P>At length, &s;he became more com|po&s;ed; but &s;till &s;he was unable to walk; and every moment we delayed there, en|crea&s;ed my fears of the return of the Tar|tars, to revenge their leader's death.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, I happened to ca&s;t my eye upon the hor&s;e of the ravi&s;her, which his followers had, in their affright, left
<PB N="173" REF="178">
behind them, tied to a tree; and plac|ing her with difficulty upon him, walked by her &s;ide to encourage and &s;upport her, till we arrived at the caravan&s;era.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t effort of her &s;trength. The delicacy of her &s;oul was wounded by the ba&s;e attempt of violation, and the affright had over-&s;hadowed her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>For three days &s;he pined in my bo&s;om, then drooping her head, like a lily torne from the root, expired without a &s;truggle.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation can be conceived only by a feeling heart. O my Zelis! thou wert the delight of my eyes, the hope and comfort of my life. She was the fir&s;t fruits of my love, by my own mo|ther, whom, according to our holy laws, I had wedded in my early youth, on the immature death of my father.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="179">I would gladly have accompanied her to the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed; but piety, and my very love for her, equally re&s;trained me.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on had had time to re&s;ume her rule during the approaches of her death. The laws of our religion forbid us to &s;hed human blood, even in &s;elf-defence. How then could I dare to &s;tain my hands with my own? Be&s;ide, who &s;hould perform the la&s;t rites to her dear remains, and &s;prinkle her a&s;hes on this altar? Who &s;hould perform the &s;ame pious office for me, that I may be reunited to her, and to the re&s;t of our holy race?</P>
<P>I was convinced of my duty, and pre|pared to fulfil it. I wa&s;hed her pure body with my tears. I wrapped it in precious &s;pices, which I received in ex|change for the hor&s;e of the Tartar, from certain merchants in the caravan&s;era, and building a lofty pile of aromatic woods,
<PB N="175" REF="180">
reduced it to a&s;hes, which I have this day &s;pread upon yonder &s;acred ruins of our altar.</P>
<P>This, O courteous &s;tranger! is the &s;ermon of my woes, which, you &s;ee, will admit of no relief. I now turn my face to our place of refuge in the mountains, there to devote the re&s;idue of my unhappy days to the contemplation of that Being, by who&s;e power, and in who&s;e pre&s;ence only, I can be re&s;tored to happine&s;s.</P></Q>

<P>THOUGH the heart of Togrul &s;ym|pathized with the unhappy &s;ufferer, there were &s;ome circum&s;tances in his &s;tory which affected him in a very different manner.</P>
<P>As his rea&s;on was convinced of the in|comprehen&s;ible e&s;&s;ence of the Deity, he con&s;idered every a&s;&s;imilation of him to ob|jects
<PB N="176" REF="181">
of &s;en&s;e, as the mo&s;t impious ab&s;ur|dity; and the very thought of paying to his creatures, the adoration due only to him&s;elf, &s;truck him with &s;acred horror.</P>
<P>Nor were his moral &s;entiments le&s;s hurt, by cu&s;toms which he held to be contrary to the mo&s;t inviolable laws of nature.</P>
<P>Well aware as he was of the inefficacy of argument in matters of religious preju|dice, he would have thought &s;ilence a crime on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, as implying an a&s;&s;ent which his &s;oul di&s;claimed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, therefore, as the Per&s;ee had ended his melancholy narrative, <Q>I con|dole with you for your lo&s;s,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O man of affliction! but I dare not offer con&s;olation before you have re|conciled your&s;elf to heaven, by a renun|ciation of tho&s;e errors (&s;hould I not rather &s;ay crimes?) which have drawn its wrath upon your head.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182"><Q>You blindly mi&s;take the creature for the Creator, and rob him of that wor|&s;hip which is his &s;ole and incommuni|cable right: and your marriages break down the fences, which nature hath e&s;tabli&s;hed to guard moral cha&s;tity, forcing her back upon her&s;elf, in con|nections, again&s;t which &s;he revolts with horror.</Q></P>
<P>Heavy as this charge was, the Per&s;ee was not aba&s;hed. Fixing his eyes upon Togrul, with a mode&s;t firmne&s;s, <Q>Mo&s;t unworthy of con&s;olation &s;hould I cer|tainly be,</Q> he replied, <Q>O &s;evere judge! if I were guilty of the crimes which you impute to me. But I exult in the a&s;&s;u|rance, that on a moment's reflection, you will your&s;elf acquit me of them.</Q></P>
<Q><P>If our marriages are contrary to na|ture, how could mankind have been propagated from one &s;tock? And
<PB N="178" REF="183">
where did the &s;ons of the fir&s;t pair find wives, if they wedded not their &s;i&s;ters? The prejudice in&s;tilled again&s;t them in infancy, by other nations, from motives unnece&s;&s;ary to us, who&s;e virtue requires not &s;uch a guard, to prevent the inter|cour&s;e of con&s;anguinity from being abu&s;ed to gratify impure de&s;ire, is mi&s;|taken for the voice of nature, whom we force not back upon her&s;elf, but free from re&s;traints, &s;ubmitted to by man alone, of all her various race.</P>
<P>More groundle&s;s &s;till is the accu&s;ation of our wor&s;hipping any other object than the Deity him&s;elf, the Author and Life of the univer&s;e, and all it contains.</P>
<P>We wor&s;hip not his creatures; we wor&s;hip him in them. We wor&s;hip him in the &s;un, as the mo&s;t glorious of his works, the fountain of that heat by which he animates all nature! We wor|&s;hip him in fire, as the &s;ub&s;titute of the

&s;un, the vehicle in which heat is in|tru&s;ted to our own management for the u&s;es of life; and we keep that fire al|ways alive, in te&s;timony of our gratitude for his &s;upporting our lives by it; and as a memorial to him to continue that &s;upport.</P>
<P>Never has man fallen into &s;o gro&s;s error, as to direct his wor&s;hip ultimately to the works of his own hands, though the pre&s;umption of ignorance hath often accu&s;ed him of it.</P>

<P>It was &s;ome time before Togrul reco|vered from the &s;urpri&s;e with which this defence of the Per&s;ee &s;truck him. He examined it with candid attention, and

<P>THE &s;en&s;ations of his heart, as he approached Bagdat, are not to be de|&s;cribed. On his arrival, he was met by an amba&s;&s;ador from the Khaliff, to enquire the cau&s;e of his coming in that ho&s;tile manner.</P>
<P>Though age, together with the change of his name, prevented Togrul from be|ing known, he directly knew the amba&s;&s;a|dor to have been one of his mo&s;t malig|nant enemies, and could not avoid feeling &s;ome natural emotions of re&s;entment; but he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them in&s;tantly, having cove|nanted with his heart to keep the charac|ters of Selim and Togrul perfectly di&s;tinct; nor to &s;hew the lea&s;t recollection of the
<PB N="181" REF="186">
former, till he &s;hould have executed his pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He replied, therefore, that as hitherto no act of his had &s;hewn any intention of ho&s;tility, &s;o &s;hould his future conduct be directed by that of the Khaliff, to whom alone he would communicate the motive of his coming.</P>
<P>This reply was by no means &s;atisfactory to the amba&s;&s;ador. He would fain have him&s;elf entered into treaty with Togrul, alledging that the Khaliff's health was un|equal to &s;uch an interview at pre&s;ent; though were it even otherwi&s;e, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a &s;o|vereign to enter into the nece&s;&s;ary alterca|tions of bu&s;ine&s;s with a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But the&s;e eva&s;ions had no weight with Togrul. He an&s;wered peremptorily, that his commi&s;&s;ion was to the Khaliff him&s;elf
<PB N="182" REF="187">
in per&s;on, to whom if he had not admi&s;|&s;ion the next morning, he &s;hould look upon the denial as a denunciation of war, and take his mea&s;ures accordingly, without farther delay; adding, with a &s;mile of contempt, that attention to the intere&s;ts of his people could never be beneath the character of a prince, with whom&s;oever it might bring him into intercour&s;e; and that when the &s;overeign could be pre&s;ent, the intervention of a &s;ervant was merely nugatory: &s;aying which, he left the am|ba&s;&s;ador, without waiting for a reply.</P>
<P>Though it was evident, that a war with Temugin mu&s;t in the end prove fatal to the Khaliff, his vi&s;ier, who after the de|parture of Selim, had wre&s;ted the whole power out of his hands, leaving him only the empty name of &s;overeign, re&s;olved to bury him&s;elf under the ruins of his coun|try, rather than admit an interview, the fir&s;t con&s;equence of which he was con&s;ci|ous would be his own depo&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188">For this purpo&s;e, he formed the de&s;pe|rate re&s;olution of making an a&s;&s;ault upon the camp of Togrul that very night, flat|tering him&s;elf with hope of &s;urpri&s;ing him in the fal&s;e &s;ecurity of peace; to confirm which, he &s;ent another emba&s;&s;y to inform him, that the Khaliff would &s;ee him the next morning.</P>
<P>But Togrul was too well experienced in the art of war to relax his care for a mo|ment on any appearances. He an&s;wered the amba&s;&s;adors, that he &s;hould be ready to attend the Khaliff at the time appoint|ed; and as &s;oon as they were gone, pro|ceeded to &s;tation his guards, and put his camp in a proper &s;tate of defence.</P>
<P>When the &s;hades of night had covered the earth, Togrul retired to his tent; and falling upon his face, poured out his &s;oul in grateful prai&s;e and adoration to him, who had protected him through the pa&s;t
<PB N="184" REF="189">
day, and implored a continuance of the &s;ame protection for that night.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he had performed this &s;acred duty, he was alarmed at a &s;udden noi&s;e; when &s;tarting up, he &s;aw a &s;trange man, with a poniard in his hand, fallen on the floor of his tent.</P>
<P>Such a &s;ight required no explanation. Togrul in&s;tantly &s;eized him, before he could ri&s;e to execute his intent; and wre&s;t|ing his poniard out of his hand, demanded who he was; and by what injury he had been provoked to attempt &s;o nefarious a crime.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, in the natural impul&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, lifting up his hands and eyes, begged for mercy, which he did not even expect, offering to purcha&s;e his par|don by a di&s;covery of the mo&s;t immediate importance.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="190">Togrul, who&s;e re&s;entment never la&s;ted longer than the cau&s;e, bade the trembling wretch merit the mercy he implored, by a candid confe&s;&s;ion of the motives to his guilt.</P>
<P>The&s;e words giving him a ray of hope, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, without he&s;itation, owned that he had been prompted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him by promi&s;es of large reward made to him by the vi&s;ier; and for that purpo&s;e had lingered behind the amba&s;&s;adors, in who&s;e train he came, till he found an opportu|nity of hiding him&s;elf in his tent, where, &s;eeing him enter &s;oon after, and pro&s;trate him&s;elf to pay his devotions, he had &s;tep|ped forth from the place where he was concealed, and was advancing to perpe|trate the deed, when his foot entangling in the fringe of the carpet, he fell at his length upon the floor; and then, as a farther plea for pardon, di&s;covered the vi&s;ier's de&s;ign of a&s;&s;aulting the camp that very night.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="191">This account was too &s;trongly confirm|ed, by the circum&s;tances in which the re|lator &s;tood, to admit of doubt. Having offered a mental tribute of thank&s;giving to heaven for &s;o &s;ignal a pre&s;ervation, To|grul called to his attendants, and ordering them to guard the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, prepared in|&s;tantly to avail him&s;elf of the information he had received.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he &s;ummoned the &s;eve|ral leaders of his troops, and unfolding the di&s;covery which had been made to him, directed one of them to take a body of forces, and marching &s;ilently out of the camp, on the &s;ide farthe&s;t from the city, to fetch a circuit, &s;o as to fall upon the enemy in the rear, as &s;oon as they &s;hould begin their attack upon the camp, where he &s;hould be ready to give them a proper reception.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers of Temugin, who were always accu&s;tomed to the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;ci|pline,
<PB N="187" REF="192">
obeyed his orders without noi&s;e or confu&s;ion; and the camp continuing as &s;ilent, as if buried in the profounde&s;t &s;leep, the enemy advanced to the attack with that &s;ecurity in which they had ex|pected to have &s;urprized him.</P>
<P>The event was &s;oon determined. The a&s;&s;ailants repul&s;ed with vigour, and them|&s;elves a&s;&s;ailed at the &s;ame time, gave up the unequal conte&s;t, and endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves by a retreat into the city; but in vain.

<P>THE fears of the inhabitants, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, are not to be expre&s;&s;ed. They expected nothing le&s;s than to be given up to all the outrages of war; but they were &s;aved by the military &s;kill, as much as by the mercy of their conqueror, who, know|ing their numbers, would not drive them to de&s;pair. Having &s;topped the fury of his &s;oldiers, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the gates, and all the places of &s;trength in the city; and placing guards to prevent any new attempts, re&s;tored all things to a &s;tate of order and tranquillity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the morning &s;un aro&s;e, To|grul advanced with a body of his troops to the palace of the Khaliff. A recollec|tion of former &s;cenes &s;welled his heart for a moment; but he &s;oon &s;hook off &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s. Calling for the commander of the guard, he ordered him to go to the
<PB N="189" REF="194">
Khaliff, and demand an interview, if he would avoid the con&s;equences of an im|mediate a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The grand vi&s;ier returned along with the officer, and after attempting to pal|liate the treachery he had been guilty of the night before, by laying the attack of the camp to the charge of the ungovern|able populace, de&s;ired that Togrul would accompany him to the Khaliff, who, he &s;aid, expected him in the divan; but To|grul, in&s;tead of making him any reply, gave a &s;ignal to his guards, who in&s;tantly &s;eized him, before he could attempt to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>An act of &s;uch &s;eeming violence natu|rally threw all the citizens into the greate&s;t con&s;ternation; but Togrul &s;oon ea&s;ed them of their fears. Waving his hand to demand &s;ilence, he declared aloud that none but the guilty &s;hould &s;uffer; nor even they, before the fulle&s;t proof of their
<PB N="190" REF="195">
guilt, and by the authority of their &s;ove|reign; ordering the vi&s;ier to be &s;trictly guarded, till he could be brought before him.</P>
<P>The tumult being thus appea&s;ed, To|grul &s;ent once more to reque&s;t the inter|view with the Khaliff, who immediately came to the gate of the palace to meet him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ight of his altered &s;tate af|fected Togrul in &s;o tender a manner, that it required all his pre&s;ence of mind to con|ceal it. Broken in &s;pirit, and &s;tooping under infirmities, he &s;carcely &s;eemed the &s;hadow of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he approached, Togrul ad|vancing in a re&s;pectful manner, informed him of the motive of his coming.</P>
<P>The Khaliff heard him with attention; and as &s;oon as he had ended, <Q>Thou
<PB N="191" REF="196">
&s;peake&s;t of peace,</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q>but acte&s;t all the outrages of war. Ha&s;t thou not taken our city by &s;urprize, while we depended on the faith of thy words? And ha&s;t thou not now &s;eized our vi&s;ier, who came to conduct thee to us, ac|cording to thy de&s;ire? Wherefore &s;hould&s;t thou continue the illu&s;ion farther? Or, why mention a choice of peace, or war, to one who is already thy pri&s;oner, and obliged to obey thy will?</Q></P>
<P>This pathetic expo&s;tulation opened to Togrul the &s;tate of the Khaliff, whom he knew to be incapable of di&s;&s;imulation. He &s;aw that he had been the &s;lave of his vi|&s;ier, who gave the &s;anction of his &s;ove|reign's name to his own iniquities.</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of retorting the charge of violated faith, he informed the Khaliff, in terms of re&s;pect, of the con|duct of his vi&s;ier, producing the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to prove his guilt, and referring the judg|ment to him.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="197">The di&s;covery &s;truck all pre&s;ent with horror. 'Holy Prophet!' exclaimed the Khaliff, rai&s;ing his hands and eyes to heaven, <Q>to what misfortunes is the mo|narch &s;ubject, who &s;eeth not with his own eyes, who tru&s;ts the reins of go|vernment out of his own hands for a moment?</Q></P>
<P>Then turning to the vi&s;ier, who &s;tood trembling in the &s;ilence of &s;elf-conviction, <Q>Thy conqueror,</Q> he continued, <Q>hath left thy fate to my di&s;po&s;al; receive that, which I doubt not but thou ha&s;t often merited before; for man &s;inks not to &s;uch con&s;ummate guilt at once.</Q>&mdash;Say|ing which, he made a &s;ignal to his guards, who in&s;tantly &s;mote off the mi&s;creant's head.</P>
<P>Togrul, in the natural impul&s;e of re|&s;entment, could not help feeling a mo|mentary inclination to have made him&s;elf known to his enemy before his death; but
<PB N="193" REF="198">
he in&s;tantly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it, blu&s;hing at a thought &s;o unworthy of him.</P>
<P>This &s;acrifice being offered to ju&s;tice, the Khaliff, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf again to Togrul, <Q>I have thus, perhaps for the la&s;t time,</Q> he re&s;umed, <Q>performed the duty of a &s;overeign in puni&s;hing guilt. It is now thine to di&s;po&s;e of me, ac|cording to the commands of thy ma&s;ter. I here re&s;ign my &s;ceptre into thine hands for him, and &s;ubmit to the will of hea|ven without repining.</Q></P>
<P>Togrul received the &s;ceptre, with an air of dignity &s;uited to the character he repre&s;ented, and holding it in his hand for a few moments, while the hearts of all pre&s;ent were bur&s;ting with &s;u&s;pen&s;e, <Q>Know, O &s;upreme of all the followers of Mahomet!</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>that the ju&s;tice of Temugin is equal to his power. He de&s;ires to conquer only for the benefit of mankind; nor doth he ever dethrone
<PB N="194" REF="199">
the &s;overeign, whom he finds worthy to rule. The errors which incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure proceeded from him to whom thou had&s;t incautiou&s;ly entru&s;t|ed thy power, and are atoned by his death; receive therefore thy &s;ceptre again from his hands, and hold it more &s;teadily in thine own for the future! Thou art from this hour the friend of Temugin.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the effect of this &s;ublime moderation upon all who were pre&s;ent. The name of Temugin was borne to heaven in acclamations of grati|tude and joy; nor was that of his &s;ub&s;ti|tute forgotten.</P>
<P>The feelings of the Khaliff were too big for utterance. He &s;unk under the weight of his own gratitude. Pro&s;trating him&s;elf upon his face, he adored the &s;overeign ruler of the univer&s;e for this in&s;tance of his divine favour; and then ari&s;ing, payed
<PB N="195" REF="200">
to Togrul the thanks due to that benevo|lent grace, by which he had even endeared the genero&s;ity of his lord.</P>
<P>The terms of their accord were &s;oon adju&s;ted. Temugin had required no ad|vantages for him&s;elf. Togrul therefore only &s;tipulated, that all under the power of the Khaliff &s;hould be &s;uffered to enjoy, unmole&s;ted, the common rights of huma|nity. That they &s;hould wor&s;hip the Deity in the manner &s;eeming be&s;t to them&s;elves, and be &s;afe from puni&s;hment and injury while they &s;hould be free from guilt; and that the traveller, and the &s;tranger who &s;ojourned in the land, &s;hould meet equal ju&s;tice and protection with the natives.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE treaty being ratified with the proper &s;olemnities, Togrul held it not nece&s;&s;ary to maintain longer a re&s;erve, which nature had the greate&s;t difficulty to &s;upport.</P>
<P>Advancing to the Khaliff, and regard|ing him with a tender a&s;pect, <Q>Can it be po&s;&s;ible,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that any change of character &s;hould &s;o &s;oon have effaced from the mind of Na&s;&s;er the memory of his mo&s;t faithful&mdash;?</Q></P>
<P>'Holy Prophet!' exclaimed the Kha|liff, &s;tarting at the well-known voice, now uttered in its native &s;weetne&s;s, <Q>whom do I hear?</Q>&mdash;Then fixing his eyes eager|ly upon him, 'It is he!' he continued, ru&s;hing into his arms, <Q>it is Selim him|&s;elf! my long-lamented, faithful Selim!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="202">All, who heard not the words of the Khaliff, were &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e at &s;uch a conduct. But when the cau&s;e of it was explained, when the citizens of Bagdat heard, that in their generous conqueror Togrul, they beheld their beloved vi&s;ier Selim, their gratitude and joy know no bounds. They flocked around him in raptures impo&s;&s;ible to be repre&s;&s;ed, ble&s;|&s;ing the happy day which had re&s;tored him once more to their &s;ight.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their joy had &s;ub&s;ided, Togrul departed for a few moments to lead his troops back to their camp, whither the Khaliff &s;ent them all manner of accommodations, in &s;uch plenty as made them entirely forget the fatigues of their march, and mix with his &s;ubjects as one people.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled every thing in proper order, Togrul returned to the Khaliff,
<PB N="198" REF="203">
who expected him with the mo&s;t ardent impatience.</P>
<P>The tenderne&s;s of their meeting, now freed from the re&s;traint of ob&s;ervation, may be well conceived. Togrul gratified the curio&s;ity of the Khaliff, by a recital of the incidents of his life, &s;ince his departure from Bagdat. On his explaining the rea|&s;on of his having entered into the &s;ervice of Aladdin, the Khaliff could not &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment. 'Holy Prophet!' he ex|claimed, <Q>to what impo&s;itions are princes &s;ubject?</Q></P>
<P><Q>From the day you left me, never did a letter from you come to my &s;ight! Never did I even hear that you were liv|ing, till I was informed of your having quitted my &s;ervice for that of Aladdin, from motives of per&s;onal di&s;regard to me! But the traitors &s;hall meet their due reward. The principal is already
<PB N="199" REF="204">
puni&s;hed, though for another crime; but the re&s;t &s;hall have their deaths em|bittered by your triumph over them.</Q></P>
<P>'O, vicar of Mahomet!' returned To|grul, <Q>let not loo&s;e your rage again&s;t tho&s;e who are &s;o far beneath it. How|ever ba&s;e their intentions, the event was directed by the hand of heaven. Had I not been driven from your &s;ervice, by that appearance of your di&s;regard, I could not have been the fortunate in|&s;trument of this day's happine&s;s. Let them no more have influence in your councils; but let that, and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of their guilt, be their only pu|ni&s;hment for this crime. For me, I ne|ver will triumph over a fallen foe.</Q></P>
<P>Togrul devoted the remainder of that day to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Khaliff's government, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould promi&s;e a continuance of his pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s. He was delivered from the mo&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="205">
&s;evere of all tyrannies, that of his own &s;ervants. All who had abu&s;ed his power were given up to ju&s;tice, and their wealth divided among tho&s;e, who had &s;uffered under their iniquitous oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirits of the Khaliff being un|equal to &s;uch long-continued exertion, Togrul left him to his re&s;t; and was re|turning to his camp, when he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find him&s;elf &s;topped by a Fa|quir, who, falling at his feet, embraced his knees, in an agony of joy, which de|prived him of the power of utterance.</P>
<P>But Togrul was not long at a lo&s;s to account for his emotions. At the fir&s;t ca&s;t of his eye, his heart acknowledged his faithful attendant Achmet, who&s;e lo&s;s, when he was &s;eized in the camp of Mo|hammed, had given him &s;o much grief.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="206">No change of condition can alter the &s;entiments of a generous heart. Togrul rai&s;ing him from the ground, and em|bracing him tenderly, bade him dry his tears, and come to his camp, where all his troubles &s;hould find an end.</P>
<P>'Lord of my &s;oul's attachment,' an|&s;wered Achmet, <Q>my troubles ended when I heard your name. But think not of me; one, much more worthy of your care requires your in&s;tant at|tendance. A friend, once ju&s;tly dear to your heart, lives, but in hope of em|bracing you again; to conclude in that happine&s;s, a life worn out in all the mi|&s;eries of oppre&s;&s;ion. If the name of Obeidah &s;till lives in your memory; if he yet holds a place in your e&s;teem, O ha&s;te to calm the emotions with which his heart is bur&s;ting, till he enfolds you in his arms!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="207">Starting at the name; <Q>And doth he live! My mo&s;t-re&s;pected, be&s;t-loved friend and benefactor!</Q> returned Togrul. <Q>I will go to him this in&s;tant; nor &s;hould have waited to be called, but that I thought his virtues had long &s;ince re|ceived their reward; that he was num|bered with the happy, in the life which never ends. Lead me to his palace, this in&s;tant!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Alas, my lord!</Q> replied Achmet, <Q>the palace of Obeidah hath long been ex|changed for a pri&s;on. You mu&s;t &s;um|mon all your fortitude to &s;upport the &s;ight of his pre&s;ent fallen e&s;tate. But let us ha&s;ten to him. He numbers every moment of our delay by a pang of mi|&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what Togrul felt at this repre&s;entation. He bade Ach|met proceed; and following him, in
<PB N="203" REF="208">
&s;ilence, mourned in his &s;oul for the &s;uf|ferings of his friend.</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ion, which u&s;ually doubles every evil of life, here fell &s;hort of the reality. On entering the pri&s;on, he &s;tart|ed back in horror, to &s;ee his friend and benefactor, the good vi&s;ier, who had fir&s;t made him known to the Khaliff, lying on the bare floor, loaded with chains.</P>
<P>Achmet had cautioned him not to make him&s;elf too &s;uddenly known to Obeidah, for fear of the effects of &s;urpri&s;e, upon an heart already &s;tretched to bur&s;ting; but nature could not be re&s;trained. The mo|ment he &s;aw him, he ru&s;hed forward, and throwing him&s;elf on the floor be&s;ide him, rai&s;ed up his aged head, and laying it in his bo&s;om, exclaimed, <Q>O my friend! O Obeidah! My friend! My friend!</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Obeidah did not require to be told, by who&s;e arms he was embraced. <Q>O Se|lim!</Q>
<PB N="204" REF="209">
he replied, <Q>O &s;on of Abudah! Though my eyes can no longer be ble&s;|&s;ed with thy &s;ight, my heart tells me it is my friend.</Q></P>
<P>Achmet, in the mean time, &s;ummoned the keeper of the pri&s;on to take off Obei|dah's chains; but the loyal old man would not permit him. <Q>The&s;e chains,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>were put on me in the name of Na&s;&s;er; and by his orders only will I &s;uffer them to be taken off. Never yet have I vio|lated his authority; nor will I begin now.</Q></P>
<P>Togrul would not contradict a loyalty which he revered, and who&s;e ob&s;ervance could add but a few minutes to the &s;uf|ferings of his friend. He therefore in|&s;tantly &s;ent one of his attendants to the Khaliff, to acquaint him with all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and reque&s;t his order for the di&s;charge of Obeidah.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="210">While they waited for the return of the me&s;&s;enger, Togrul could not forbear ex|pre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment at the Khaliff's treating his mo&s;t faithful &s;ervant in &s;o cruel a manner; adding, with a tone of &s;everity, that if he had known he was capable of &s;uch a gro&s;s abu&s;e of his power, he &s;hould not have been &s;o ha&s;ty in rein|&s;tating him in it.</P>
<P>The loyal heart of Obeidah could not bear to hear his &s;overeign loaded with &s;o injurious a charge. <Q>Take care, O my &s;on!</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>nor let thy tongue take liberty with the cho&s;en of the Lord. Though my &s;ufferings were inflicted in his name, they proceeded not from him. Too well I know that he &s;uffered him|&s;elf, under the tyranny by which I was oppre&s;&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>On Togrul's expre&s;&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, almo&s;t to doubt, at what he heard, Obei|dah informed him, that immediately after
<PB N="206" REF="211">
his departure from Bagdat, to join the armies of Aladdin, his enemies pre&s;uming upon the ea&s;y temper of Na&s;&s;er, who, ne|glecting the cares of government, had given him&s;elf up entirely to the cultivation of tho&s;e amu&s;ements of an idle mind, which the vanity of their profe&s;&s;ors have digni|fied with the pompous title of the finer arts, had, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, wre&s;ted the royal power out of his hands, and covered their own nefarious crimes under the &s;anction of his name; in which they at length proceeded to &s;uch an height, that on his own con&s;tantly oppo&s;ing them in the divan, and labouring to open the Kha|liff's eyes, they threw him into this pri&s;on, where, without re&s;pect to his age, his in|nocence, or the exalted office, which he had &s;o long filled with honour, they had detained him ever &s;ince, loaded with chains, in the manner he then was.</P>
<P>Before Togrul had time to reply, a noi&s;e at the door of the pri&s;on announced
<PB N="207" REF="212">
the arrival of the Khaliff, who running wildly up to the place, where Obeidah lay in the bo&s;om of Togrul, 'Holy Prophet!' he exclaimed, <Q>is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch ini|quity could be perpetrated by man? O Obeidah! my faithful Obeidah! think not that thy &s;overeign ever knew of thy &s;ufferings; ever could make &s;o ungrate|ful a return for the &s;ervices of thy life. But thy wrongs and mine are avenged. Our better angel, our Selim hath &s;et us both free; and we will live together henceforward to ble&s;s his name.</Q></P>
<P>This conde&s;cen&s;ion, this goodne&s;s of his &s;overeign was too much for the full heart of Obeidah to &s;upport. He &s;eized the hand of the Khaliff, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his brea&s;t, expired without a &s;truggle, in the exce&s;s of his hone&s;t joy.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was too moving for huma|nity to bear. Togrul, rai&s;ing the Khaliff from the dead body, upon which he had

My di&s;tre&s;s, at your &s;eparating your&s;elf from me, in the camp of Mohammed, need not be de&s;cribed. I &s;ought you for &s;everal days with the mo&s;t anxious diligence, till I could no longer hope to find you there.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="209" REF="214"><P>It then occurred to me, that yielding to the melancholy with which your &s;oul was &s;o heavily oppre&s;&s;ed for the lo&s;s of your father, you had taken this method of avoiding my too officious zeal, of which you often complained, and retired to give your&s;elf up to the uninterrupted indulgence of your grief.</P>
<P>But my attachment could not bear the thoughts of de&s;erting you in &s;uch a &s;ituation. I re&s;olved to find you out, if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ave you from your&s;elf; from a de&s;pair unworthy of you. Where to &s;eek you, was the difficulty.</P>
<P>At length, I recollected the plea&s;ure with which I had often heard you men|tion the friend&s;hip of Obeidah; and thought you might po&s;&s;ibly have re|turned to him: at lea&s;t, it was the only place where I could &s;ee any hope of &s;uc|ceeding in my &s;earch.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215">I directly therefore left the camp, and came to this city, where on my enquir|ing for Obeidah, gracious heaven! what was my a&s;toni&s;hment! my grief! to find the good old man ju&s;t &s;inking into his grave, under all the mi&s;eries of impri|&s;onment and want, without even the al|legation of a crime.</P>
<P>On my mentioning your name, he &s;eemed to forget him&s;elf for a few mo|ments to enquire after you; rejoicing in your &s;ucce&s;s, and weeping for your mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>My &s;oul could not for&s;ake virtue in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. I devoted my&s;elf entirely to attending on one &s;o dear to you, &s;ince I could not have the happine&s;s of find|ing your&s;elf.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming therefore this habit of a Faquir, I &s;hared with him the &s;u&s;tenance which I daily received from the hand of
<PB N="211" REF="216">
charity, and enabled him to &s;truggle with his fate, till he &s;unk under the hap|pine&s;s, too &s;uddenly accumulated upon him, by your arrival.</P></Q>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t blu&s;h of morning had began to gild the firmament, Togrul returned to the Khaliff; and recommend|ing to him once more to hold with &s;teadi|ne&s;s the &s;ceptre, which he had re&s;tored to his hand, began his march to rejoin Te|mugin, covered with the unfading laurels of a victory, which had made the vanqui&s;hed happy.</P>
<P>On his arrival at the camp, he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf before the emperor, and gave him an account of his &s;ucce&s;s; when in&s;tead of the approbation, with the hope of which he had plea&s;ed him&s;elf, Temugin demanded &s;ternly, why he had given peace to the Khaliff, on &s;uch ea&s;y terms, when he had had it in his power to have made him accede to whatever he thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="217">Much as Togrul was affected, at &s;o unexpected a reproof, he was not ab&s;ent from him&s;elf. Falling at the emperor's feet, 'I gave him a good peace,' he an|&s;wered, <Q>O &s;overeign of the world, be|cau&s;e I wi&s;hed to have it long, and faith|fully pre&s;erved. They, who pu&s;h their advantages to extremity, deceive them|&s;elves. A bad peace never la&s;ts longer, than the nece&s;&s;ity which made it be accepted.</Q></P>
<P>Temugin pau&s;ed &s;ome moments, with|out making any reply; then &s;oftening his look and accent, <Q>Go,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>and take order for the refre&s;hment of your troops. I will con&s;ider the&s;e matters, at &s;ome other time.</Q></P>

<P>THE conduct of Togrul, on this delicate occa&s;ion, fixed him &s;o firmly in the e&s;teem and confidence of Temugin, that he admitted him into his mo&s;t &s;ecret councils; and delighted to do him honour.</P>
<P>Such favour was not beheld without envy; but the humility with which he bore his greatne&s;s, and the di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, that ruled his conduct, &s;oon di&s;armed its rage; and if it was not po&s;&s;i|ble for the favourite of a prince to have a true friend, he had the happine&s;s, at lea&s;t, of having no enemies.</P>
<P>But this happine&s;s &s;oon palled upon him; and he &s;ickened in that &s;un&s;hine, for which all around him &s;ighed. <Q>If I mu&s;t not hope to find my father!</Q> would he often &s;ay to Achmet, in the

I will have the appro|bation of my own mind, at lea&s;t, to &s;upport me.</Q></P>
<P>He would have thrown him&s;elf at the feet of Temugin, and be&s;ought his per|mi&s;&s;ion to depart; but the circum&s;tances of the time made the very thought a di&s;|honour,
<PB N="215" REF="220">
honour, Gelaleddin having collected all his force, for one la&s;t &s;truggle with his fate: He re&s;olved therefore to exert every effort in order to accelerate an event, which alone delayed the accompli&s;hment of his only hope.</P>
</DIV2>

<P>WHILE he was paying this painful tribute to honour, he happened, one day, to fall in with a body of Gelaleddin's troops, who were conducting that prince's hou&s;hold to a place of &s;afety, farther from the &s;eat of the war.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with continued victory, and following a leader whom they loved, his &s;oldiers &s;oon overcame a &s;ervile and di&s;|heartened band, who unattached to the charge they were to guard, thought only of &s;ecuring their own &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="221">As the wars of Temugin were conducted on the principles of humanity and honour, Togrul gave orders, immediately after the victory, for &s;ending back the wives of Gelaleddin, without his even &s;eeing them; when a rumour, that that prince was con|cealed among them, obliged him to deviate from his intended delicacy.</P>
<P>The alarm of the women on his enter|ing the tent, in which they were, may well be conceived; but he &s;oon pacified their fears, by a&s;&s;urances of re&s;pect and &s;afety; and then informing them of the cau&s;e of his coming, reque&s;ted that they would &s;ubmit to a &s;earch, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ible, by lifting up their veils.</P>
<P>Their compliance having &s;hewn that the rumour was without foundation, To|grul was about to withdraw, when his eye was caught by a female &s;lave, who&s;e &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing beauty, neither the meanne&s;s of her habit, nor the grief with which &s;he
<PB N="217" REF="222">
appeared to be overwhelmed, beyond all the re&s;t, could hide. He gazed at her, for &s;ome minutes, in rapturous a&s;toni&s;h|ment; till Achmet perceiving his &s;ituation, reminded him to retire, which he did in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that he forgot to give any orders for their departure.</P>
<P>Achmet beheld with joy the impre&s;&s;ion, which the beauty of the &s;lave had made upon Togrul; and re&s;olved to heighten it by every means in his power. He was truly attached to him; but as his own &s;oul was fired with the &s;tronge&s;t ambition, he con&s;idered his de&s;ign of retiring to Himilco, as a weakne&s;s unworthy of him; which this incident, if rightly improved, might happily enable him to prevent.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Togrul had di&s;po&s;ed his men properly for the night, he retired to his tent, where he gave him&s;elf up to the contemplation of the beauteous &s;lave.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223">While he was thus indulging him&s;elf in a plea&s;ure, of the tendency of which he was not aware, Achmet entered; and after &s;ome occa&s;ional di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;ked him &s;lightly if he had ob&s;erved a beautiful &s;lave, who attended upon the wives of Gelaleddin.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, even from one, with whom he lived in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved familiarity, threw Togrul into evident confu&s;ion. He he&s;itated &s;ome mo|ments, before he could &s;peak, and then blu&s;hing, though uncon&s;cious for what cau&s;e, an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any one, who was not blind, to have pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch beauty unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The manner in which he &s;aid this, con|firming Achmet's conjecture, he directly proceeded to feed the flame, which he &s;aw kindled in the brea&s;t of Togrul, with the warme&s;t de&s;criptions of her beauty, and
<PB N="219" REF="224">
allu&s;ions to the plea&s;ure, which the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it mu&s;t be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Togrul, for the fir&s;t time, li&s;tened to &s;uch conver&s;ation, without di&s;like. His virtue was forced to yield to an attack, in which nature her&s;elf took &s;o &s;trong a part again&s;t it; and he &s;unk in&s;en&s;ibly into a &s;oft intoxication, which drowned all remembrance of him&s;elf, and every pur|po&s;e of his heart.</P>
<P>When Achmet had thus prepared him for his de&s;ign, he a&s;ked whether he had given orders for the departure of the wives of Gelaleddin? All the plea&s;ing hopes, with which Togrul had been &s;o fondly feeding his pa&s;&s;ion, faded at the&s;e words. He turned pale; and fixing his eyes for &s;ome time upon the ground, at length, with an heavy &s;igh, de&s;ired Achmet to take upon him a care, which he found him&s;elf unable to execute.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="225">Achmet, who knew that the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;ign depended on its being conducted with addre&s;s, re&s;olved to &s;eem rather to follow, than lead him to the point he de&s;ired; affecting therefore not to under|&s;tand what he meant, he a&s;ked, with a look of anxiety, if he had received any wound in the late battle, to which he had neglected applying proper remedies.</P>
<P>Deeply as Togrul was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he could &s;carcely forbear &s;miling, at &s;uch a mi&s;take. <Q>No, my friend,</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q>I have received no wound; but that which the beauteous &s;lave hath inflicted on my heart; to which, I fear, it never will be in my power to apply any remedy.</Q></P>
<P>'And wherefore &s;hould you fear that?' replied Achmet. <Q>The wounds of love are, of all others, the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be healed, where the object is in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226">'But how is &s;he in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?' returned Togrul. <Q>Doth &s;he not belong to the hou&s;hold of Gelaleddin? and mu&s;t I not re&s;tore her to him? I dare not, I cannot violate the orders of Te|mugin: Orders founded on the mo&s;t &s;acred principles of virtue; and which my own &s;oul holdeth in the highe&s;t honour.</Q></P>
<P>'How indu&s;trious,' &s;aid Achmet, with a &s;mile, <Q>are we to torture, to deceive our&s;elves? The orders of Temugin re&s;pect only the &s;acred property of the marriage bed. Slaves are, by the uni|ver&s;al laws of war, the captor's prize, the reward of valour, which Temugin never meant to deprive him of. Di&s;|mi&s;s the wives of Gelaleddin with due re&s;pect; and he will never think your detaining a &s;lave an inva&s;ion of his right.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="227">Though a propo&s;al, &s;o favourable to his wi&s;hes, readily &s;atisfied the &s;cruples of Togrul, he had a re&s;pect to the appearance of virtue, a mode&s;ty in his nature, which would not permit him to carry it openly into execution.</P>
<P>But Achmet was not at a lo&s;s to &s;ur|mount this difficulty. He coun&s;elled To|grul to &s;end away the women directly, with every mark of honour, under the conduct of a per&s;on in whom he could confide; and &s;aid he would him&s;elf follow at the fir&s;t dawn of the morning, as if he was going on &s;ome &s;ecret occa&s;ion of the war, and bring the fair &s;lave without any alarm, or its being even known for whom, to a neighbouring fortre&s;s, where Togrul might meet her in the evening; and in|dulge him&s;elf in her company for &s;ome days, as if he was only attending to the motions of the enemy; a purpo&s;e for which it was a proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228">Had not Togrul been blinded by his pa&s;&s;ion, he would have rejected with di&s;|dain, a propo&s;al, founded on a neglect of his duty, though but for a moment: but &s;uch was his infatuation, that he equally forgot what he owed to his own honour, and to the confidence of Temugin.</P>

<P>THE conflict in his mind, when Ach|met departed, is not to be de&s;cribed. Though his pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ilenced the voice of rea&s;on, it had another antagoni&s;t to &s;truggle with, which was not &s;o ea&s;ily to be &s;ubdued. In &s;pite of all his efforts to elude it, the remembrance of Himilco, and his daughter, would ever and anon force it&s;elf upon him; and damp his highe&s;t ardours. Every moment pro|duced a new re&s;olution, which the next overturned, leaving him in the &s;ame fluc|tuation.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="229">Attachments of mere de&s;ire lo&s;e their force, when the object is no longer pre&s;ent. Every time he thought of the daughter of Himilco, his pa&s;&s;ion for the fair &s;lave grew weaker; till, in the end, it entirely &s;ub|&s;ided, leaving no more trace behind than ruffles the bo&s;om of a &s;tream, into which &s;ome fragment of the rock hath newly fallen from the impending cliff.</P>
<P>He awoke, as from a troubled dream; and wondering at his own weakne&s;s, re|&s;olved to wipe off the &s;tain of it, by &s;end|ing back the fair &s;lave the moment he &s;hould arrive at the place, where he had appointed to meet Achmet. Nor would he even have gone thither, had he not thought that countermanding, without any vi&s;ible rea&s;on, the orders he had &s;o lately given to his troops, would betray an un&s;teadine&s;s, that mu&s;t lower him in their eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="230">Exulting in this victory, he arrived at the fortre&s;s, where he no &s;ooner &s;aw Ach|met, than he commanded him to &s;end back the &s;lave that very night; declaring that he would not even &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Achmet, who read in his looks the &s;truggle in his heart, was more &s;urprized than di&s;couraged at this change of his re&s;olution; which he did not doubt but the &s;ight of the fair &s;lave would &s;oon alter, could he prevail upon him to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Without &s;eeming therefore to he&s;itate at paying obedience to his orders, he a&s;ked him, with a di&s;contented look, what rea&s;on he &s;hould give her, for &s;uch a di&s;appoint|ment of tho&s;e hopes, with which he had taken &s;o much pains to in&s;pire her.</P>
<P>Togrul, who&s;e conque&s;t over his pa&s;&s;ion was far from being &s;o complete as he thought, could not forbear enquiring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gerly, what hopes he meant; to which
<PB N="226" REF="231">
Achmet an&s;wered, in a tone of indifference, the hopes of his love, which he had &s;o confidently a&s;&s;ured her of, that he was ut|terly a&s;hamed to inform her of a change in his &s;entiments, as unaccountable as it was &s;udden.</P>
<P>Incapable of artifice him&s;elf, Togrul &s;u&s;pected none in Achmet. He told him, with a &s;igh, the rea&s;on of his &s;ending her back, acknowledging, at the &s;ame time, the pain which that re&s;olution had co&s;t him.</P>
<P>Achmet, who wanted not virtue, though his &s;en&s;e of it was neither &s;o exten&s;ive nor &s;o &s;ublime as that of Togrul, looked upon this as no more than a fal&s;e refinement, to which it was his duty to open the eyes of his friend.</P>
<P>But as he was &s;en&s;ible, that it would be in vain to attempt rea&s;oning on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject, he affected to approve the re&s;olution
<PB N="227" REF="232">
Togrul had taken, and only de&s;ired that he would him&s;elf acquaint the fair &s;lave with the motive of it; a mark of atten|tion which, he &s;aid, would change her re|&s;entment into re&s;pect of his con&s;tancy, the virtue deare&s;t to the &s;ex; adding, when Togrul &s;eemed to he&s;itate, that &s;urely he could not doubt his own re&s;olution &s;o far, as to apprehend danger from &s;o &s;hort an interview; or aggravate the pain of her di&s;appointment, by &s;uch an ungenerous in&s;tance of contempt, as to &s;end her away without conde&s;cending even to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>This was an attack which Togrul could not re&s;i&s;t. His heart harboured not a &s;en|timent that was not truly generous; nor would he admit the appearance of a weak|ne&s;s of which he was not con&s;cious. He con&s;ented therefore to &s;ee her, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have taken order for the di&s;po&s;al of his troops, directing Achmet to pre|pare, in the mean time, for her departure.</P>

<P>EVERY &s;tep, as he approached her tent, encrea&s;ed the emotions which the thought of this interview rai&s;ed in his brea&s;t. He entered, trembling and irre|&s;olute, where he found her &s;itting on the ground, di&s;&s;olved in tears, and wailing her&s;elf in &s;obs of woe.</P>
<P>The power of beauty, when aided by compa&s;&s;ion, is irre&s;i&s;tible. He &s;topped &s;hort, and gazing at her for &s;ome mo|ments, turned to Achmet to learn the cau&s;e of her tears.</P>
<P>Achmet, who &s;aw that the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;ign depended on the improvement of the pre&s;ent moment, and &s;crupled not any means to accompli&s;h an end which he thought ju&s;t, breathed a &s;oft whi&s;per in his ear, that all her grief aro&s;e from his having informed her of Togrul's late re&s;o|lution

to &s;end her back; and therefore ad|vi&s;ed him not to mention any thing of it, till &s;he &s;hould be a little more compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Togrul's re&s;olution, which had begun to waver the minute he &s;aw her, was to|tally overturned by the&s;e words. Every motive of honour and virtue, which had &s;o lately &s;wayed him, now gave place to his pa&s;&s;ion. He ru&s;hed forward, and throwing him&s;elf at her feet, attempted to &s;ooth her grief with profe&s;&s;ions of love and vows of con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>But what was his di&s;appointment to find, that in&s;tead of appea&s;ing, this only en|crea&s;ed her di&s;tre&s;s. He pau&s;ed for &s;ome minutes, utterly at a lo&s;s what to con|clude; then fixing his eyes pa&s;&s;ionately upon her, conjured her, in the tendere&s;t terms, to declare the cau&s;e of her afflic|tion, and depend upon every relief in his power to procure.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="235">Moved by the manner in which he &s;poke, &s;he rai&s;ed her head, and looking earne&s;tly at him, a&s;ked how he, who had &s;o lately torn her away from an hu&s;band, whom &s;he dearly loved, could affect to be a &s;tranger to the cau&s;e of her affliction.</P>
<P>Equally &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed at what &s;he &s;aid, Togrul enquired ha&s;tily who was her hu&s;band? And upon her an&s;wering, Gelaleddin, demanded again, how &s;he came then to be clad in the habit of a &s;lave? Whereupon &s;he informed him, that the wives of that prince not expect|ing &s;uch generous treatment as they had experienced, &s;he, his mo&s;t beloved, had a&s;&s;umed that di&s;gui&s;e, in order to &s;ave the honour of his name at lea&s;t, &s;hould any violence be offered to her.</P>
<P>Togrul &s;tood agha&s;t! He &s;aw the pre|cipice over the verge of which he hung! He &s;aw al&s;o the only way of e&s;caping. It was painful; but it was indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="236">The occa&s;ion called forth all his virtue. He he&s;itated not a moment; but explain|ing the error, into which he had been led by her own precaution, removed all her apprehen&s;ions, and dried her tears, by a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he &s;hould be directly &s;ent back to her hu&s;band &s;afe, and un&s;o|licited farther by an unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, which was not now more di&s;agreeable to her, than di&s;approved by him&s;elf; and giving, in her pre&s;ence, the nece&s;&s;ary or|ders to Achmet (who, terrified at the dan|ger into which his too &s;anguine zeal had unwillingly betrayed his friend, prepared to carry them into in&s;tant execution) hur|ried away from a &s;cene, more di&s;tre&s;sful than he could &s;upport.</P>
<P>Not that his di&s;tre&s;s was lighter, when he retired to his tent, and reflected on his late conduct. He looked back with hor|ror to the manifold ruin which he had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped; nor did remor&s;e make the pro&s;pect before him much le&s;s painful.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="237">Though error might &s;eem to extenuate the crime of his attempt upon the wife of Gelaleddin, his intended infidelity to the daughter of Himilco, his intended neglect of duty to Temugin, admitted of no exte|nuation.

<P>Nor were the&s;e efforts un&s;ucce&s;sful.

Animating his faithful followers by his example, he bravely continued the fight, marking every &s;tep of his retreat with the dead bodies of his bolde&s;t foes, till he was forced to the very brink of the river, where, looking round him for a moment, and &s;eeing almo&s;t all his people &s;lain, he formed the noble re&s;olution of attempting to &s;ave him&s;elf for an happier day, when heaven might be more propitious to him; and in&s;tantly plunged into the river, which rolled in &s;uch a torrent, that the greatne&s;s of the danger prevented his being pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="240">While he was gloriou&s;ly &s;truggling thus with fate, Togrul, who&s;e efforts had prin|cipally driven him to this extremity, was ru&s;hing forward to plunge in after him, when he was &s;topped by Temugin, who ho|noured &s;uch virtue, even in a foe. <Q>Re|member,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the day in which you e&s;caped from the rovers in the de|&s;arts of Africa; and imitate that gene|ro&s;ity, which you have your&s;elf experi|enced. Leave this gallant prince to his fortune. This is a &s;on worthy of his father. Happy is he who hath &s;uch children!</Q></P>
<P>Togrul was affected in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner by the&s;e words. Though in the head|long fury of the battle he would have pur&s;ued Gelaleddin; to have defeated &s;o noble an effort for the pre&s;ervation of his liberty, when he could re&s;i&s;t no longer, would have &s;tung his generous heart with incurable remor&s;e. The very thought overwhelmed him with &s;hame; as his be|ing
<PB N="236" REF="241">
&s;o happily prevented filled him with joy.</P>
<P>The total defeat of Gelaleddin having put an end to the war, Togrul thought him&s;elf now at liberty to fulfil his re&s;olu|tion, by retiring to Himilco in the de&s;art.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, he threw him&s;elf at the feet of Temugin the next morning, and pouring out the gratitude of his heart for all the favours he had received from him, humbly be&s;ought his permi&s;&s;ion to depart, and accompli&s;h the fate ordained for him by heaven.</P>
<P>Temugin, to whom the virtues of To|grul had endeared him, no le&s;s than his valour, heard, with concern, a reque&s;t, with which his regard would not permit him to comply. Though he thought the &s;ubject of too tender a nature for him to interfere with directly, he was not at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover his motive for de&s;iring to de|part,
<PB N="237" REF="242">
nor whither he intended to bend his way, as he remembered the love which he had expre&s;&s;ed for the daughter of Himilco, and his promi&s;e that he would return to her; a promi&s;e which he meant not ob|liging him to violate, but only to defer its performance to a fitter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Expo&s;tulating with him, therefore, in terms of e&s;teem, on his want of attach|ment, which alone, he alledged, could prompt him to &s;eek el&s;ewhere a fortune, that in his &s;ervice prevented his pur&s;uit, he told him, that he could not con&s;ent to his departure, till he &s;hould have accom|pli&s;hed certain matters which he had in contemplation; after which, if he per|&s;i&s;ted in his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, he would not only give him his con&s;ent, but al&s;o the a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for executing it with happy effect.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e, by which Togrul &s;aw, that the emperor was no &s;tranger to his
<PB N="238" REF="243">
intention, over-paid the delay on which it was founded, by hopes he had never ven|tured to indulge before. He embraced the knees of his generous benefactor, in a tran&s;port of grateful joy, which the ful|ne&s;s of his heart left him not the power of uttering.</P>

<P>TEMUGIN, having thus compleated the conque&s;t of Khouare&s;m, i&s;&s;ued a mandate to all the princes, who governed the &s;everal kingdoms of his boundle&s;s em|pire, to meet him with all their hou&s;eholds, in the plains of Karakathai, where he in|tended to relax from the fatigues of war,
<PB N="240" REF="245">
and devote one whole year to the plea&s;ures of the chace, while he married his &s;ons, and regulated the various forms of govern|ment in his dominions; before he pro|ceeded to farther conque&s;ts, which he had in contemplation.</P>
<P>The preparations which he ordered to be made for this &s;olemnity, at which the greater part of human kind were to a&s;&s;i&s;t, were &s;uited to the magnificence of his &s;pirit, and the greatne&s;s of his power. Nothing, which nature could &s;upply, or art devi&s;e, was wanting to make the en|tertainment equal to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The morning before Temugin propo&s;ed repairing to the plains of Karakathai, he &s;ent for Togrul into his tent, and regard|ing him with a look of favour, 'Togrul,' &s;aid he, <Q>I am now going to give you a mark of my confidence, which will put your abilities to the &s;tricte&s;t proof.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="241" REF="246"><P>There is a country in the mountains of Curdi&s;tan, called Betlis, the people of which boa&s;t of having repelled all attempts made to &s;ubdue them; and do, at this day, live in defiance of every foreign power. It is nece&s;&s;ary to my honour to put an end to this boa&s;t. While I march towards Karakathai, take you the troops under your command. Reduce this people to obedience; and bring their king to receive his fate from my word. No &s;overeign &s;hall rule, but by my permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I know your valour; but that, tho' the fir&s;t, is not the only virtue required in the leader of an army. Activity, vi|gilance, and circum&s;pection will be no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to you on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>A&s;tyages, who reigns in Betlis, is an experienced warrior; and his people are an hardy race, who, &s;trangers to the wants of luxury, as having no commerce
<PB N="242" REF="247">
with other nations, are &s;atisfied with the &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which their labour ex|torts from a &s;terile &s;oil; and will fight with advantage, in a country full of fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, known only to them&s;elves.</P></Q>
<P>Though Togrul was far from approv|ing the motive of this war, his heart was not in&s;en&s;ible to the glory which it opened him an opportunity of acquiring. Bow|ing him&s;elf, therefore, in grateful a&s;&s;ent, he proceeded directly to execute a charge which did him &s;o much honour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he drew near to the country, which he was &s;ent to conquer, he called together the &s;everal leaders of his troops, and laid them under the &s;tricte&s;t injunc|tions to re&s;train the &s;oldiers from every act of rapine, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion, which in the nature of their duty could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided. <Q>Though they are our ene|mies,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>let us not forget that they are men, as well as we! Let us
<PB N="243" REF="248">
&s;pare the country, which is to belong to our &s;overeign.</Q></P>
<P>This re&s;traint, at the &s;ame time that it &s;aved the country from deva&s;tation, &s;aved al&s;o the forces under his command from all tho&s;e dangers which await an army broken loo&s;e from di&s;cipline, and &s;cattered over an enemy's country in &s;earch of plunder.</P>
<P>He penetrated into the heart of the land, without meeting any misfortune, though the king watched his &s;teps, with a powerful army, ready to take any oppor|tunity of attacking him to advantage; as he was unwilling to ri&s;que the fate of his country, on a battle, upon equal terms.</P>
<P>Finding, however, all his &s;chemes de|feated by the vigilance and circum&s;pection of Togrul, and apprehen&s;ive that his own &s;oldiers might be di&s;pirited at &s;eeing him &s;o cautious, A&s;tyages, at length, re&s;olved
<PB N="244" REF="249">
to tru&s;t all to the valour of his people, and the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; and drawing all his forces together, waited for the enemy in a place which defended the approach to his capital.</P>
<P>This was directly the point to which Togrul had all along wi&s;hed to lead him. He in&s;tantly di&s;po&s;ed his troops in order of battle, and led them to the charge in per&s;on.</P>
<P>The conflict was &s;uch as might be ex|pected from men animated by the &s;tronge&s;t motives. The &s;oldiers of Temugin were &s;o accu&s;tomed to conquer, that they look|ed upon them&s;elves as invincible; while the men of Betlis, who knew that they fought for the deare&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life, exerted them&s;elves, every one, as if the event depended upon his &s;ingle arm.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the battle raged thus, with equal fury, the adver&s;e leaders, who flew from place to place to enforce the execu|tion of their orders, by their own example chanced to meet.</P>
<P>Knowing each other by the number of their attendants, and animated by an equal pa&s;&s;ion for glory, they advanced, as by con&s;ent, to decide the conte&s;t, making a &s;ignal to their men to draw back; who readily obeyed, willing to commit the for|tune of the day to their re&s;pective valour.</P>
<P>Nor was their confidence deceived on this important occa&s;ion. Every effort, which art and courage could &s;ugge&s;t to &s;trength, was exerted &s;o equally by each combatant, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to form any judgment of the event.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="251">While every heart panted thus in anxi|ous expectation and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the king of Betlis, provoked at a re&s;i&s;tance which he had never met before, &s;mote Togrul &s;uch a blow, as cleft his helmet in twain; which, falling to the ground, left his head unarmed; at the &s;ame time, that his own &s;word, unequal to the force, broke &s;hort in his hand.</P>
<P>Togrul recovering from the &s;troke, which had &s;tunned him for a moment, was preparing to return it on his defencele&s;s enemy, when his ear was &s;truck by the voice of a man, who throwing him&s;elf be|tween the combatants, exclaimed, <Q>Hold, O Selim! nor &s;tain thy &s;oul with the blood of thy father.</Q></P>
<P>Starting at the well-known voice, To|grul dropped his &s;word, which hung over the head of his adver&s;ary, and looking eagerly at the per&s;on who &s;poke, in&s;tantly knew the face of Abudah, who, by this
<PB N="247" REF="252">
time, had thrown off his helmet, and fallen on his knees before him.</P>
<P>The piety of Togrul could not bear &s;uch a &s;ight. He ran, and rai&s;ing him from the ground, threw him&s;elf at his feet, and embraced his knees in tran&s;ports of pious joy.</P>
<P>Tenderly as the heart of Abudah felt this endearment, the time was too impor|tant for him to indulge it. Turning ha&s;|tily from Togrul, 'There pay thy duty!' &s;aid he, pointing to the king, who &s;tood lo&s;t in wonder at what he &s;aw. <Q>That, O Selim! is thy father.&mdash;O king of Betlis, behold thy &s;on!</Q></P>
<P>The king no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words, than yielding to the impul&s;e of nature, he ru&s;hed forward, and throwing him&s;elf upon the neck of Togrul, bedewed his bo&s;om with tears, &s;obbing, <Q>O my &s;on! have I
<PB N="248" REF="253">
at length found thee? O Ar&s;aces! My &s;on! My &s;on!</Q></P>
<P>Though Togrul felt the tenderne&s;s of this embrace, he was unable to return it with equal warmth. He knew no father but Abudah; at the &s;ame time, he knew that Abudah was incapable of a&s;&s;erting any thing but truth. He was utterly at a lo&s;s.&mdash;In the mean while, the chieftains of both armies, &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, gathered promi&s;cuou&s;ly around them, to learn the cau&s;e of this affecting &s;cene.</P>
<P>Abudah &s;aw the importance of the mo|ment. 'O &s;oldiers of Temugin!' &s;aid he, mounting upon a rock, which happened to be near, and &s;preading abroad his arms, <Q>and you men of Betlis, behold and re|vere the my&s;terious ways of that power which rules the world! The leader of the armies of Temugin is &s;on to the king of Betlis. Heaven, which per|mitted them to prove their valour, in
<PB N="249" REF="254">
your &s;ight, this day, hath di&s;covered them to each other, in time to prevent the crime of parricide, and put an end to this groundle&s;s war. Let us not therefore pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e its &s;acred will.</Q></P>
<P>The manner in which he uttered the&s;e words en&s;ured their effect. His eyes, his voice, his ge&s;tures, &s;eemed to &s;peak im|mediate in&s;piration. All heard him with reverential awe, and waited but the word of their leaders to pay obedience to what they thought a divine command.</P>
<P>The king and Togrul had, by this time, recovered them&s;elves &s;ufficiently to attend to their &s;ituation. Advancing therefore to their re&s;pective armies, they unfolded this extraordinary event; and declared their intentions of obeying the will of hea|ven, &s;o plainly &s;ignified; and extending to their people that peace, which nature had e&s;tabli&s;hed between them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="255">Nor was this difficult to be effected. The manner in which the war had been conducted, had prevented any per&s;onal animo&s;ity, by preventing private injuries. It had rather been a conte&s;t for glory, than a war.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as they had drawn off their forces, and taken proper care to prevent any accidental di&s;agreement between them, they repaired to a tent, which Abudah had cau&s;ed to be pitched in the mid&s;t be|tween the two armies, equally anxious to concert &s;uch mea&s;ures for confirming the peace, thus happily commenced, as &s;hould meet the approbation of Temugin, with|out derogating from the honour of A&s;ty|ages, or injuring the intere&s;ts of his people.</P>
<P>As &s;uch an interview mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily open all the tenderne&s;s of nature, it was
<PB N="251" REF="256">
ordered that no per&s;on &s;hould be pre&s;ent be&s;ide Abudah, who waited to receive To|grul; and before the arrival of his father, relieve his heart from the &s;u&s;pen&s;e with which it mu&s;t be tortured, by an event equally intere&s;ting and &s;trange.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Togrul entered the tent, he ran to Abudah, and cla&s;ping him in his arms, <Q>O father of my heart!' &s;aid he, unfold the my&s;tery of my fate; nor keep me longer in a &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which my &s;oul is unable to &s;upport. Who am I?&mdash; How can I be other than thy &s;on?&mdash; And yet, I blu&s;h to own, that my heart feels a divided love; a re&s;pect, which it never felt before.</Q></P>
<P>'Son of my &s;oul!' an&s;wered Abudah, as he ki&s;&s;ed away the tear which rolled down the cheek of Togrul, <Q>re&s;train thine impatience to a more proper moment. Thou owe&s;t thy being to A&s;tyages. He is thy father. How the precious charge
<PB N="252" REF="257">
of thine education came to be entru&s;ted to me, mu&s;t be re&s;erved to an hour of more lei&s;ure; as well as a recital of the occurrences, through which heaven hath led thee to this happy period. At pre|&s;ent, other matters demand our attention.</Q></P>
<P>A&s;tyages entering as he &s;poke the&s;e words, Togrul yielding to the impul&s;e of nature, ran to him, and crying, <Q>O my father! my father!</Q> threw him&s;elf at his feet, and embraced his knees, unable to &s;ay more; while A&s;tyages wept upon his head in exta&s;y, too big for utterance.</P>
<P>When they had indulged nature thus, for a few bli&s;sful minutes, Abudah, who was more pre&s;ent to him&s;elf, though his feelings were &s;carcely le&s;s lively, reminded them of the more immediate cau&s;e of their meeting.</P>
<P>When Togrul had repeated the charge, given to him by Temugin, A&s;tyages
<PB N="253" REF="258">
mu&s;ed for &s;ome moments; then with a look &s;erenely re&s;olute, <Q>My &s;on!</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I trace the hand of heaven in all the&s;e events, and will not pre&s;ume to &s;et my|&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to it.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The emperor hath commanded thee to reduce this country to obedience, and bring me to receive my fate from his word. His command &s;hall be fulfilled. You &s;hall appoint Abudah to govern our country, in his name, while I will go with you to him, and tru&s;t my fate to heaven.</P>
<P>I had flattered my&s;elf with the hope of expelling the invaders of my country by force, or dying honourably in its de|fence; but the&s;e hopes are now changed.</P></Q>
<P>As &s;uch a propo&s;al could admit of no difficulty, peace was directly announced to both armies, who embraced it with equal plea&s;ure; having made too &s;trong a proof
<PB N="254" REF="259">
of each other's valour, to de&s;ire a conti|nuance of the war.</P>
<P>When Togrul had adju&s;ted every thing for beginning his march the next morning to Karakathai, where he was to join Te|mugin, he returned to the tent, where he found his father expecting him, in com|pany with Abudah.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time given up to mutual endearments, <Q>I will leave you for a few moments, my &s;on!</Q> &s;aid A&s;tyages, <Q>while I go to make &s;ome preparations for my journey. The father of &s;o large a fa|mily, hath many things to &s;ettle, before he can leave it. Abudah will, in the mean time, inform you of matters, which you mu&s;t naturally be de&s;irous to know.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="255" REF="260">
<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE anxiety, evident in the looks of Togrul, made it not nece&s;&s;ary for him to claim the performance of this promi&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>O &s;on of my affection! thou beloved of my &s;oul!</Q> &s;aid Abudah, as &s;oon as A&s;tyages withdrew, <Q>I am now to re&s;ign an honour, of which I am unworthy, and exchange the name of father for that of friend; a &s;ecret, my having concealed which from you &s;o long, hath co&s;t my heart many a painful hour.</Q></P>
<Q><P>You mu&s;t remember my having often told you, that the birth of a &s;on depriv|ed me of a wife, whom I had wedded in a foreign land. That you were that &s;on, it was natural for you to &s;uppo&s;e, from the care which I be&s;towed upon
<PB N="256" REF="261">
your education; but alas! I lo&s;t both wife and &s;on together.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I never informed you in what country I had met with this misfor|tune, was my fear of your conceiving a de&s;ire to &s;ee it, before the time appointed by your father &s;hould be fulfilled.</P>
<P>My wife was the &s;i&s;ter of A&s;tyages, who&s;e friend&s;hip prompted him to be|&s;tow her upon me; as it afterwards did, upon her death, to entru&s;t me with the precious charge of you, his only &s;on, then an infant.</P>
<P>"How various are the griefs," he &s;aid to me once, when he came to con&s;ole me in the days of my affliction, <Q>which prey upon the wretched heart of man! Thou mourne&s;t the death of a &s;on, while my anxiety for the fate of one, who is yet alive, maketh me equally unhappy.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="257" REF="262"><P>Hitherto hath this people defended their liberty again&s;t the ravagers of the earth; and while I live, I tru&s;t that hea|ven will enable me to pre&s;erve the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ing to them. But I tremble to look forward. The very peace which we now enjoy, which I have earned by &s;o many difficulties and dangers, alarms my fears.</P>
<P>Trained in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, I am prepared to &s;truggle with it, when|ever I may be a&s;&s;ailed. But will my &s;on have the &s;ame ability, without hav|ing the &s;ame opportunity of acquiring it? Will not ea&s;e and idlene&s;s debilitate his body? Will not flattery corrupt his mind?</P></Q>
<P>I &s;trove to remove his fears, by urg|ing that it was in his own power to ob|viate tho&s;e evils, by taking care that his &s;on received a proper education.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="263"><Q>It is not po&s;&s;ible,</Q> he replied, <Q>for me to attend to that care. The cares of &s;overeignty are a &s;ufficient weight, with|out the addition of another, &s;carcely le&s;s weighty. Though even if I could de|vote my&s;elf to his education, I cannot hope for the &s;ucce&s;s you mention. He would be told that he was born to reign; and that would defeat all my endeavours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a word, there is but one way to remove my fears; and that depends upon you. I will not injure your friend|&s;hip by a parade of a&s;king that which I know you will perform. You mu&s;t take my &s;on with you to your native country; and educate him there as if he were your own. Thus will he be|come worthy to wear the crown of his ance&s;tors; and be able to fulfil my hopes of defending the liberties of his people.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="264"><Q>When you &s;hall think him qualified to &s;hare the weight of a crown with me, bring him home. Till then, let him remain with you; and even unto death, &s;hould he not prove worthy of me. I will &s;upply you with wealth &s;ufficient to make provi&s;ion for his &s;upport.</Q></P>
<P>How I executed this important charge, you want not to be told. To conceal your lineage more effectually, I even changed your own illu&s;trious name of Ar&s;aces, for that which had been borne by my father. Happy! thrice happy am I to re&s;tore it to you now: To re&s;tore to your father a &s;on worthy of him: worthy of the &s;acred race of Cyrus, from whom you derive your de&s;cent: a race, who through all the wars, which have &s;haken the earth, from the day, whereon A&s;|cander overturned the throne of Darius, have to this hour pre&s;erved their royalty undimini&s;hed, in the&s;e mountains; whither Ar&s;inoe, &s;i&s;ter to that ill-fated
<PB N="260" REF="265">

<Q><P>I UPBRAID you not with a de&s;er|tion, to which I plainly &s;ee, you were directed by heaven. As &s;oon as I awoke that morning, my heart mi&s;gave me, when you an&s;wered not to my call. I aro&s;e to &s;eek you, but in vain. The di&s;ap|pearance of your hor&s;e, and your &s;word, too well convinced me, that you were gone beyond my reach.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not attempt to de&s;cribe to you, what I felt at that thought. Though hopele&s;s of your return, I waited for one mi&s;erable moon, if po&s;&s;ibly your mind might change, and a &s;en&s;e of filial duty and affection lead you back to me.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="266">At the expiration of that time, I put my &s;andals on my feet, girt my loins, and with my &s;taff in my hand, &s;et out to bring the melancholy tidings to your father. I would have attempted to &s;eek for you; but you had turned the &s;ecre&s;y, which I had &s;o often inculcated to you, again&s;t my&s;elf. You had never dropped a &s;yllable, which could direct my &s;earch.</P>
<P>Your father felt the lo&s;s as a man; but &s;upported it with the fortitude worthy of him. He even conde&s;cended to offer me con&s;olation; and acquitted me of all blame, by referring your con|duct to the guidance of heaven.</P>
<P>This awoke an hope of that happine&s;s which your return hath thus fulfilled. All my cares, all my griefs, are now over payed; and I am ready to die con|tented, whenever the angel of death &s;hall call upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="267">But, O my &s;on! through what &s;ur|pri&s;ing &s;cenes mu&s;t heaven have led your &s;teps? My heart pants&mdash;And behold, your father comes bur&s;ting with equal impatience, to hear the intere&s;ting tale.</P></Q>
<P>A&s;tyages entering as he &s;poke the&s;e words, 'I re&s;tore to thee, O king,' con|tinued Abudah, leading Ar&s;aces to him, <Q>thy &s;on, no longer Togrul, nor Selim, but Ar&s;aces, a genuine &s;cyon of the &s;acred &s;tock of Cyrus. O, Ar&s;aces, behold a father worthy of thee!</Q></P>
<P>'O my &s;on! My father!' they ex|claimed with one voice, as they ran into each other's arms, while Abudah, un|able to &s;peak, gave vent to his joy in a flood of tears.</P>
<P>When they had payed this tender tri|bute to nature, A&s;tyages hinted to his &s;on a de&s;ire to hear the incidents of his life, &s;ince his departure from Abudah. Ar|&s;aces
<PB N="263" REF="268">
in&s;tantly obeyed, and placing him|&s;elf between them, related, in brief, the wonderous tale.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had concluded, <Q>Could a particular in&s;tance be wanting in proof of that, which all the works of nature prove,</Q> &s;aid Abudah, <Q>thy life, O Ar&s;aces, affords the &s;tronge&s;t conviction, that the ways of heaven are always con|ducted with wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and ju&s;|tice, however in&s;crutable to the feeble powers of human rea&s;on. Let us there|fore adore that Being, who ordereth every thing for the be&s;t; nor perplex our&s;elves with doubts, which only in|volve us in deeper darkne&s;s.</Q></P>

<P>ARSACES began his march the next morning, accompanied by his father. On his arrival at the camp of Temugin, he ha&s;ted to his pre&s;ence, that he might him|&s;elf deliver the fir&s;t tidings of the&s;e won|derful events.</P>
<P>Pro&s;trating him&s;elf before his throne, <Q>May the king of men,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>live for ever. Thy commands have been executed in their fulle&s;t extent. The country of Betlis pays obedience to Te|mugin; and its king is come to receive his fate from thy word. But in the king of Betlis, O behold the father of Togrul! The father of him, who in thy &s;ervice hath unknowingly lifted his &s;word again&s;t the author of his life.</Q></P>
<P>Temugin, who thought the enterprize
<PB N="265" REF="270">
upon which he had &s;ent Togrul, too diffi|cult to have been accompli&s;hed in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, was utterly at a lo&s;s to conceive the meaning of what he heard. He de|manded therefore an explanation of cir|cum&s;tances, which appeared &s;o extraor|dinary to him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Ar&s;aces had recited the whole, the emperor pau&s;ing a few mo|ments, as lo&s;t in thought, <Q>I adore the ways of heaven,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>and war not with its will. King of Betlis,</Q> he continued, <Q>on what terms art thou wil|ling to receive the re&s;titution of thy crown this day, from my hands?</Q></P>
<P>'Conqueror of the world,' an&s;wered A&s;tyages, <Q>it ill befitteth me to make terms with him into who&s;e power I have willingly &s;urrendered my&s;elf. If thou wilt permit me to &s;tudy the happine&s;s of my people; and pre&s;erve them in the
<PB N="266" REF="271">
enjoyment of tho&s;e laws, which their fathers have handed down to them, we will render thee, with fidelity, all the &s;ervices which can be expected from men who are free. If thou require&s;t more, my promi&s;e &s;hall not deceive thee.</Q></P>
<P><Q>For know, O Temugin, that though I have the power to commit my own liberty to thy di&s;po&s;al, I have none over that of the meane&s;t &s;ubject, whom I lately governed; every one of whom, while he pays obedience to the laws, is &s;afe under their protection; and would with readine&s;s &s;acrifice his life in their defence.</Q></P>
<P>'We will put their virtue to the trial;' replied Temugin. <Q>My will &s;hall be cir|cum&s;cribed by no laws. In the mean time, return thou in &s;afety to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I &s;corn to take advantage of thy confidence.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="272">'O &s;overeign of the world,' exclaimed Ar&s;aces, throwing him&s;elf again at the feet of Temugin, and embracing his knees, <Q>what is to be the fate of the cap|tive of thy power, the &s;lave of thy goodne&s;s? Can I fight again&s;t the au|thor of my being? Can I fight again&s;t him, who&s;e beneficence hath made that being a ble&s;&s;ing to me? O divide not duties, which heaven hath united! nor &s;et my &s;oul at war again&s;t it&s;elf! My father will teach his people to pay you the highe&s;t &s;ubjection, which man can pay to man, without derogating from the dignity of their common nature.&mdash; O my father, &s;ubmit your&s;elf to the power of him who rules the world. He will not deprive your &s;ubjects of liberty, who gave it to your &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>The agony, in which Ar&s;aces &s;poke the&s;e words, affected all who were pre&s;ent. The generous heart of Temugin melted in compa&s;&s;ion. <Q>Ari&s;e,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>O &s;on,
<PB N="268" REF="273">
worthy of thy father; and be happy! And thou, O A&s;tyages, return to thy kingdom in peace; and rule thy people according to the rectitude of thine heart. Happy art thou in being worthy to have &s;uch a &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Every one was filled with joy, by the&s;e words. Even envy and ambition forgot them&s;elves, for &s;ome moments, and joined in the general acclamations, which rai&s;ed the name of Temugin to heaven.</P>
<P>A&s;tyages, who had hitherto &s;upported his royal character, could not re&s;i&s;t the tender impul&s;e of his gratitude. <Q>Thou ha&s;t conquered, O Temugin,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>thou ha&s;t conquered my &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P>He would have thrown him&s;elf at the feet of the emperor, but he was prevented. Temugin caught him in his arms; and embracing him warmly, <Q>I receive thee, as my friend,</Q> he &s;aid; <Q>and in no other
<PB N="269" REF="274">
light will I admit thee to offer thy&s;elf to me. Happy is the &s;overeign who hath &s;uch a friend.</Q></P>
<P>A&s;tyages would have departed the next morning, but Temugin in&s;i&s;ted on his remaining &s;ome time; during which he took delight to do him honour, above all his princely gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>The magnificence of &s;uch a &s;cene, never equalled upon earth, dazzled not the eyes of A&s;tyages; nor could the offer of Te|mugin, to make him &s;overeign over many nations, &s;hake his &s;teady virtue.</P>
<P><Q>Think it not ingratitude,</Q> he an&s;wered, <Q>O fir&s;t of human kind, in virtue as in power, that I decline favours, your holding me worthy of which covers me with the highe&s;t honour. My &s;oul feels the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of your generous con|fidence, and friend&s;hip; but its ambi|tion never &s;oared &s;o high. I am content
<PB N="270" REF="275">
with the contracted &s;phere, in which heaven hath placed me; and find the government of one &s;mall kingdom &s;uf|ficient for my abilities. Rather would I reign in the hearts of a &s;ingle village, made happy by my care, than rule over di&s;contented millions, with a rod of iron; it not being the extent, but the good government of a kingdom, which in my humble &s;en&s;e con&s;titutes the happine&s;s and glory of a &s;overeign.</Q></P>
<P>Temugin was &s;truck with &s;entiments, the ju&s;tice of which his &s;oul acknowledged; though they had never occurred to him before. He pau&s;ed for &s;ome minutes, then cla&s;ping A&s;tyages to his brea&s;t, <Q>We mu&s;t fulfil the de&s;tiny appointed for us,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>were I not Temugin, it &s;hould be my wi&s;h to be A&s;tyages.</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome days &s;pent in the clo&s;e&s;t in|tercour&s;e of mutual e&s;teem, A&s;tyages de|parted for his own country, accompanied
<PB N="271" REF="276">
by his &s;on; who offered to remain, but Temugin waved &s;uch a &s;acrifice of every tender feeling. <Q>After &s;o long a &s;epara|tion,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>your &s;ouls mu&s;t require &s;ome time to &s;eal the connection of na|ture, by acquaintance. When I want your &s;ervice, I will call for it. Till then be happy in each other.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE return of A&s;tyages re&s;tored to his people, the only happine&s;s which they had to wi&s;h for. Under him they enjoyed every ble&s;&s;ing of life; and the virtues of his &s;on gave them an a&s;&s;ured pre&s;age of its continuance.</P>
<P>A&s;tyages, in the overflowing of paternal affection, would have &s;hared his throne with his &s;on; but he declined it. <Q>Let it be my honour, let it be my happi|ne&s;s,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>to be the foremo&s;t of thy &s;ubjects, in humble obedience, as
<PB N="272" REF="277">
in love! Let me learn to reign, in the execution of thy commands.</Q></P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of all this general joy, A&s;tyages ob&s;erved that a &s;igh would &s;ome|times &s;teal unawares from his &s;on; that an ab&s;ence of mind, in &s;pite of all his care to conceal it, &s;hewed he cheri&s;hed &s;ome &s;e|cret grief. Alarmed at this di&s;covery, he communicated it to Abudah, and de&s;ired him to try to explore the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Abudah, in all his intercour&s;e with Ar&s;aces, had ever endeavoured to &s;ink the authority of a father in the intimacy of a friend; an intimacy, which now knew no bounds; as the former character, which, notwith&s;tanding all his endeavours, had kept Ar&s;aces at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, was at an end.</P>
<P>He found him walking, pen&s;ive and alone, by the &s;ide of a rivulet, which ran through the gardens of A&s;tyages. <Q>Whence
<PB N="273" REF="278">
cometh it, O my &s;on!</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that you &s;eparate your&s;elf thus from &s;ociety? What means that &s;mothered &s;igh, which this in&s;tant hath e&s;caped you? Hath Ar&s;aces any grief, which he is afraid to communicate to Abudah? Has he a thought, which he would hide from his friend?</Q></P>
<P>Ar&s;aces was aba&s;hed, at being &s;o &s;ur|prized, at meriting this tender rebuke. He blu&s;hed, and hung down his head for a few moments, unable to make any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Recovering him&s;elf at length, <Q>O guide of my youth!</Q> he replied, <Q>the heart of Ar&s;aces harboureth not a thought which he is afraid to entru&s;t to you. The &s;tate in which I left the virtuous Hi|milco&mdash;My father may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;ap|prove&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="279">'And the daughter of Himilco!' inter|rupted Abudah, cla&s;ping him in his arms. <Q>Blu&s;h not, my &s;on! To be in&s;en&s;ible to love, argues a defect in nature; an incapacity for its mo&s;t exqui&s;ite happi|ne&s;s. Nor need you fear your father's di&s;approbation. He will a&s;&s;i&s;t you to obtain your wi&s;hes. The choice of rea|&s;on cannot be unworthy of thee.</Q></P>
<P>This di&s;covery gave the greate&s;t joy to A&s;tyages, who wi&s;hed not for any thing &s;o ardently, as to &s;ee the virtues of his &s;on continued in his offspring. It was agreed that Ar&s;aces and Abudah &s;hould &s;et out directly for the habitation of Himilco, at|tended by a train &s;ufficient to protect them on the way.</P>
<P>The journey was long; but nothing is too much for love. They performed it without meeting any misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="280">The &s;urprize of Himilco, on &s;eeing &s;uch a numerous company approach his habi|tation, may be well conceived; but that &s;urprize was &s;oon turned to joy, when he heard the well-known voice of Ar&s;aces, who advanced before the re&s;t. He de|&s;cended in&s;tantly, and falling upon his neck, bedewed it with tears of joy.</P>
<P>When they had recovered from the &s;oft|ne&s;s of this &s;cene, Ar&s;aces pre&s;enting Abu|dah to Himilco, <Q>Receive into thy friend|&s;hip,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that Abudah, who&s;e vir|tues thou ha&s;t &s;o often admired. Em|brace, O Abudah! the beneficent re|liever of my di&s;tre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Congenial virtues attract each other. Himilco and Abudah embraced with the e&s;teem of long acquaintance.</P>
<P>Ar&s;aces, having given order for the en|campment of his train, a&s;cended with Abudah, into the habitation of Himilco,
<PB N="276" REF="281">
where he was &s;oon ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of Arpa&s;ia, who joyfully obeyed the fir&s;t call of her father to receive him.</P>
<P>After mutual congratulations on the happine&s;s of their meeting, Ar&s;aces grati|fied the anxiety of his ho&s;ts, with a recital of the events of his life, &s;ince he had departed from them; the vici&s;&s;itudes of which frequently drew the &s;ympathetic tear from the gentle Arpa&s;ia, though de|licacy prevented his di&s;clo&s;ing the circum|&s;tance mo&s;t intere&s;ting to her.</P>
<P>But Abudah was not under the &s;ame re&s;traint. Arpa&s;ia withdrawing as &s;oon as Ar&s;aces had concluded his narrative, Abu|dah made a &s;ignal to him to follow her, and acquainted Himilco with A&s;tyages's approbation of his &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Himilco, who was &s;uperior to the affec|tation of making a difficulty of that which gave him plea&s;ure, acknowledged that his
<PB N="277" REF="282">
daughter returned the love of Ar&s;aces, and con&s;ented to end his days with them in Betlis.</P>
<P><Q>I acknowledge and adore,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>the hand of heaven, which hath evi|dently led me through &s;uch wonderous ways to this happine&s;s; which I will not ungratefully embitter, by repining that I was not thought worthy to effect the happine&s;s of my country al&s;o. I re&s;ign my&s;elf humbly to its will, which is al|ways right.</Q></P>
<P>Nor did Arpa&s;ia receive the declaration of Ar&s;aces's love with le&s;s candour. She re|ferred him to her father for an an&s;wer; &s;ay|ing, with a blu&s;h, in which mode&s;ty added new graces to beauty, that her inclination would find no difficulty in accompanying her obedience to his com|mands.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="283">Himilco could not leave the a&s;ylum of his di&s;tre&s;s, without feeling the mo&s;t ten|der emotions. But the recollection of pa&s;t misfortunes only brightened the happy pro&s;pect before him. He payed the tri|bute of &s;ome pious tears to the dear me|mory of tho&s;e who&s;e remains he left be|hind him, and then departed with a grate|ful heart.</P>
<P>They arrived in &s;afety at the court of A&s;tyages, who&s;e happine&s;s was compleated in theirs; and in the a&s;&s;urance, which their virtues, continued in a numerous offspring, gave him of the happine&s;s of his people: and Ar&s;aces acknowledged, that true wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;teth in humble obedience to the will of heaven, without arrogantly pre&s;uming to &s;can its ways.</P>
