<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following attempt to ac|count for the Cau&s;e of the pre|&s;ent Epidemic Fever which has rag'd in the we&s;tern parts of this king|dom this &s;ummer, was drawn up at the in&s;tance of &s;ome friends; and not with any direct intention to be publi&s;h'd; but the frequent alarms from all quarters, and the terrors &s;ome had, on account of the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of receiving infection, determined me to lay my thoughts on this important affair before the Public.</P>
<P>As I really thought peoples fears on this account were groundle&s;s and with|out the lea&s;t Foundation, &s;o I endea|voured to account for things in regard
<PB N="6" REF="4">to the pre&s;ent Epidemic, in a way fa|miliar and obvious to almo&s;t ev'ry ones capacity, and to common ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I know 'tis commonly objected, how ea&s;y a matter it is to lay down an Hy|pothe&s;is, and deduce and &s;pin out Con&s;e|quences, to make every Phaenomenon, every Symptom of a di&s;ea&s;e to be account|ed for by that Hypothe&s;is. But the fol|lowing Remarks at lea&s;t as I imagine are founded upon matters of fact, every ones experience, the known laws and properties of matter and motion in re|gard to the &s;olids and fluids of our bodies.</P>
<P>If there be any thing in them mate|rially wrong, whereby it &s;hall appear to any candid Per&s;on, that I have been mi&s;taken, I &s;hall think my&s;elf oblig'd to him, if he'll take the trouble to give me better information, and &s;et me right. But as for any little conceited nibler and dealer in &s;mall wares, who will be
<PB N="7" REF="5">&s;narling and finding fault when he has neither will nor capacity to in&s;truct us better, who pretends to have wit, when he has &s;carce common &s;en&s;e; or any one who will hint his di&s;like without offer|ing to give us a better account, or who will &s;ententiou&s;ly condemn, becau&s;e he would be look'd upon as &s;hrewd; as for tho&s;e or &s;uch like I heartily de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>As for the Gentlemen of the Profe&s;|&s;ion who are of any &s;tanding, and &s;uch as really de&s;erve that name, the&s;e Re|marks are not intended to offer <HI>them</HI> any thing that is new or uncommon; the&s;e things mu&s;t have fallen under their re|flection: and if there be any thing that may be deem'd too pre&s;umptive or inde|cent in regard to the Cen&s;ure pa&s;t upon the recommendation of the u&s;e of vinegar by the College of Phy&s;icians to our Sail|ors in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> I hope it will give them an opportunity of recon&s;ider|ing that affair &s;ince a recommendation of the <HI>general</HI> u&s;e of it cannot but be of ill
<PB N="8" REF="6">con&s;equence in a &s;tate of the fluids already too much coagulated and &s;tagnant, as I think I have proved in the following Sheets.</P>
<P><HI>In jugularem Canis injeci aceti uncias duas. Cordis contractio paulo frequen|tior; quoad caetera nulla in Cane muta|tio.

<P><Q>"I injected, &s;ays he, into the jugular vein of a Dog two ounces of Vine|gar, whereupon the heart was con|tracted a little more frequently, other|wi&s;e there was but little alteration in the Dog; then I injected two ounces more, upon which re&s;piration became difficult and trouble&s;ome, but upon opening the Iliac Artery, from whence was taken, a good deal of grumous blood, he breathed pretty well again. Then I injected two ounces more, whereupon the Animal expired. Open|ing the Iliac Vein, the blood was very thick, and congeal'd into a &s;olid Ma&s;s: in the re&s;t of the veins and arteries 'twas &s;omewhat concreted, in the heart, e&s;pecially in the left Ventricle the blood was &s;trongly coagulated."</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you were pleas'd to &s;igni|fy your de&s;ire of knowing what my &s;entiments were concerning the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever, and what my method of treating it, to your Candour I &s;ubmit the following ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<P>I would remark to you in the fir&s;t place, that notwith&s;tanding the many outcries we have had from all parts of the Country of the malignancy and con|tagious nature of the reigning Fever, there is nothing very particular or un|common in it, any more than that a par|ticular con&s;titution of Air may be pro|ductive of a particular di&s;order, and may induce what we call an Epidemic Di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But properly &s;peaking we know of but three contagious or infectious Di&s;|ea&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> the Plague, Small-Pox, and the Mea&s;les, all which, as far as we know, have <HI>Africa</HI> for their original, if at lea&s;t we except &s;ome few which are communicated by contact.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the violent heats of the pre&s;ent &s;ummer after an exce&s;&s;ive cold &s;pring, we need not, I think, be at a lo&s;s in accounting for the pre&s;ent
<PB N="13" REF="11">reigning Fever, &s;ince every one knows, who is ever &s;o little vers'd or engag'd in ob&s;ervations of this kind, what an ef|fect an Ea&s;tern or Northern Air has in bracing up our fibres, and rendering them rigid and ela&s;tic, and how on the con|trary a Southern or South-we&s;tern Air, with exce&s;&s;ive hot weather, relaxes them. The very great change from exce&s;&s;ive cold to exce&s;&s;ive hot weather, and by &s;o &s;uddena tran&s;ition, could not but make a very great alteration in the temper of our bodies. <HI>Hypocrates,</HI> who liv'd two thou&s;and Years ago, and who was the mo&s;t diligent ob&s;erver of the cau&s;es and effects of di&s;ea&s;es either before or after him that liv'd in the World, told us, that the change of the &s;ea&s;ons was the principal Parent of di&s;ea&s;es; and no wonder, &s;ince we ob&s;erve at different times and &s;ea&s;ons of the year, the dif|ference of the &s;pring, weight, heat, cold, and moi&s;ture of the Air. The blood and humours which were before by the ela|&s;tic
<PB N="14" REF="12">force of the &s;olids comminuted and render'd fit for their &s;everal &s;ecretions, are now by their &s;unk and relax'd &s;tate, become heavy and too abounding, and want that &s;pur which is nece&s;&s;ary to car|ry off the recrements, and prevent a tendency to a &s;tagnation and putrefaction. The blood's vi&s;cidity continually increa|&s;ing by the heat's exhaling the finer and more fluid parts of it, and the <HI>vis a tergo</HI> growing le&s;s and le&s;s by the re|laxation of the fibres, ob&s;tructions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e, and con&s;equently there mu&s;t be brought on an inactive putrid &s;tate of the fluids; from hence I think may be accounted for, the variety of &s;ymptoms, and the frequency of the pre|&s;ent Epidemic Fever, without having recour&s;e to any particular taint or in|fection communicated and brought to us from the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> as has been idly &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>From the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning we may account for the &s;ickne&s;s and mor|tality of our men in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> having pa&s;s'd from a Northern to a Southern Climate, from a cold to a hot air, and great moi&s;ture, occa&s;ion'd by their heavy rains at particular &s;ea&s;ons, which contribute exceedingly to the re|laxation of the fibres, and to the in|ducing that putrid and accumulated &s;tate of the fluids which has been de&s;cribed: and if our Sailors were to bleed, and af|terwards bath in the &s;ea water, which they have &s;uch good opportunities for, at their arrival in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> it would contribute very much to the rai|&s;ing the ela&s;tic force of the &s;olids, and preventing that vi&s;cid, &s;tagnating and putrid &s;tate of the fluids.</P>
<P>Here I cannot but take notice, that if this way of rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, how injurious the u&s;e of vinegar mu&s;t be in
<PB N="16" REF="14">this &s;tate of the blood, from the known properties of acids coagulating the ma&s;s.</P>
<P>With humble deference to the Judg|ment of &s;o learned a Body as that of the College of Phy&s;icians I would &s;ubmit it to them whether they were not a little too ha&s;ty in recommending the <HI>general</HI> u&s;e of vinegar to our men in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> for tho' a tendency of bracing the fibres may be urged in its favour, yet its coagulating &s;tagnating property mu&s;t be injurious to a blood already too coagulated and &s;tagnant, according to the foregoing Theory. And now I am upon the &s;tory of vinegar, I cannot help taking notice of the u&s;e has been made of it &s;ince its recommendation from the College. Some are not contented with the great benefit they imagine they re|ceive from its internal u&s;e, but look up|on it as having &s;omething of a charm with it to keep off and prevent infection, and the unfriendly taint of this Epide|mic fever; and for this rea&s;on they &s;prinkle with vinegar walls, floors and
<PB N="17" REF="15">bed-po&s;ts, which have contracted this taint; and which they have been told was a practice during the raging of the Plague in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Whether there be any thing in vine|gar oppo&s;ite to the principles, nature, or effects of that direful and contagious di&s;ea&s;e, 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to enquire into, but that it has any good effect either in promoting, or e&s;pecially in curing the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever, I think is far from being demon&s;trable.</P>
<P>Our Jayl, Bridewell and Work-hou&s;e Fevers, of late &s;o mortal, have not only the peculiar con&s;titution of air already de&s;cribed for their cau&s;e, but to that we may add confinement, want of exerci&s;e, numbers and na&s;tine&s;s, and a want of proper and &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment and &s;upport thro' the exce&s;&s;ive dearth and &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, all which have a prodigious tendency of &s;inking the &s;o|lids beneath their natural &s;tandard, of producing a depauperated, vi&s;cid, &s;tag|nating
<PB N="18" REF="16">and corrupted &s;tate of the blood and juices of the body.</P>
<P>If a great Man's definition of a Fever would in all ca&s;es hold good, <HI>viz. aucta circulatio &s;anguinis,</HI> perhaps acids and vinegar might be of &s;ome &s;ervice; but in the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever is mo&s;t commonly found, a depre&s;s'd pul&s;e, oc|ca&s;ioned, as I imagine, by too great a quantity of fluids in proportion to the &s;trength and ela&s;ticity of the &s;olids, from whence ob&s;tructions ari&s;e, and from whence may be deduced and accounted for that variety of threatning and often|times fatal &s;ymptoms we meet with in this di&s;ea&s;e; and tho' no Epidemic does or ever did appear exactly in the &s;ame &s;hape (very far from it) on account of different con&s;titutions, different forma|tion of parts, mens different pa&s;&s;ions and different ways of living, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the &s;ame con&s;titution of the air, the &s;ame properties of the air they in common breathe in, and the &s;ame properties of the food they in common feed on, will
<PB N="19" REF="17">produce in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;ame &s;ort of di&s;ea&s;e, tho' differing in &s;ome, per|haps in &s;everal circum&s;tances, and this is what we call Epidemic, from <GAP DESC="foreign"> among the people.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not undertake to give a very particular account, and enumerate all the &s;everal &s;ymptoms attending this Fever, &s;ince they appear different in different con&s;titutions, ages, &s;exes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> give me leave to point out a few, and which &s;eem to be the principal ones. Mo&s;t com|monly we find a low depre&s;s'd pul&s;e from a plenitude of fluids and want of proper force in the &s;olids. No very great thir&s;t, or very foul tongue, an heavy pain of the head, an oppre&s;&s;ion on the brea&s;t, the Urine pretty high colour'd, tho' &s;ometimes pale and without a &s;edi|ment. No very great complaint of heat, a faintne&s;s, pro&s;tration of &s;trength, &s;weats, which give very little relief, becau&s;e not critical, a Diarrhoea, or a Delirium, I &s;ay, or a Delirium, becau&s;e if a Diarrhoea comes on towards the beginning of the
<PB N="20" REF="18">Fever, it prevents mo&s;t commonly a De|lirium.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal circum&s;tances which I have ob&s;erved attending this Fever; and tho' a variety of appellati|ons have been given to it, but chiefly that of a malignant pe&s;tilential, which I apprehend tho&s;e who give it that name, have &s;carce any fix'd and determinate meaning and Ideas of; yet the principal thing to be regarded is, what the di&s;|ea&s;e it&s;elf is, and how it is to be treat|ed; and &s;ince we have laid it down as a great and prime Cau&s;e of this Fever, <HI>viz.</HI> the immoderate heats of the &s;ummer &s;etting in after an un&s;ea&s;onable winter, and very cold &s;pring, &s;o affecting the &s;o|lids of our bodies, whereby they were &s;unk beneath their natural Standard, by which means there became an accumula|tion or too great a load of humours; hence the ob&s;tructions, vi&s;co&s;ities, &s;tag|nations, putrefactions, and the direful train of &s;ymptoms ob&s;ervable in the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="21" REF="19">reigning di&s;ea&s;e we need not I think have recour&s;e to (tho' that can't be demon&s;trably di&s;proved) a particular deleterious quality in the Air to account for them, &s;ince we know very little or nothing about this deleterious quality, or can find out any thing &s;pecific or a|lexiterial to oppo&s;e and counteract it.</P>
<P>The method of cure then mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure depend upon Evacuations of &s;ome kind or other, to remove the accumulation and load which oppre&s;s and overbalance the &s;olids, to bring down and dimini&s;h the quantity of fluids that they may bear a proportion to the relaxed and &s;unk &s;tate of the &s;olids; and then by proper gently &s;timulating and attenuating medicines to rai&s;e the force and ela&s;ticity of the fibres to &s;uch a pitch as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to remove the remaining ob&s;tructions, temper the vi&s;cidity, put in action the &s;tagnating and putrid Ma&s;s, and di&s;po&s;e the hu|mours
<PB N="22" REF="20">for their &s;everal excretions, and prevent the like &s;tate ari&s;ing.</P>
<P>It frequently happens in this Fever that nature &s;ets up a method of cure her&s;elf; &s;o we &s;hould take care how we counteract her, for in&s;tance, if we find a Diarrhoea coming on in the beginning, which we very often find, the Patient will need &s;carce any other evacuation, bleeding will be then unnece&s;&s;ary, and 'twould be prepo&s;terous to endeavour by a&s;tringents to put a &s;top to it, it is an effort of nature to relieve her&s;elf, the blood throws off its enemy in plentiful &s;treams through the inte&s;tinal glands; and it has been ob&s;erved, that when it has been &s;topt by a too officious hand admini&s;tring a&s;tringents, or by any other accident, fatal have been the con&s;equen|ces; the patient has fallen into a Deliri|um thereupon, or into &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tances by which he has been carried off.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<P>During this &s;truggle, this plentiful di&s;charge, 'tis needle&s;s to remark, that Nature mu&s;t be &s;upported from time to time with &s;ome generous cardiacs.</P>
<P>Since this is a method that nature fre|quently takes to relieve her&s;elf, we may without ab&s;urdity ask, why the Phy&s;i|cian neglects this Method; and though purging in Fevers has been look'd upon by &s;ome as prepo&s;terous, and going a|gain&s;t the rules both of nature and of art, as rai&s;ing too great a commotion where there was but too great a &s;truggle before, yet I think that affair is not car|ried &s;o far now as it has been formerly, and that in mo&s;t kinds of Fevers &s;ome or other of them we &s;ee it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e this evacuation, but nature in this, as in all other ca&s;es, mu&s;t be attended to, her motions narrowly watch'd, and carefully ob&s;erv'd, that the Phy&s;ician who is her &s;ervant, does not look one way whil&s;t &s;he points out another.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<P>Bleeding is another method Nature takes to relieve her&s;elf, as we frequent|ly find by the plentiful Haemorages at the no&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e. Opening a vein in that ca&s;e is advi&s;able, becau&s;e relief will be the &s;ooner obtained, and in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es in this fever we find a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of this di&s;charge, to take off the Plethora, and bring the blood to an E|quilibrium with the Fibres: But it is not the lea&s;t part of the skill of the Phy&s;ician to determine upon the quantity of blood which is to be taken off; and here I apprehend are many mi&s;takes made, here is the rock which many Pre|tenders to the art medical &s;plit upon, and &s;hipwreck the poor patient, though they them&s;elves, the more is the pity, e&s;cape; here if they draw blood with an undi&s;tingui&s;hing hand, not di&s;cerning what proportion the &s;trength of the Fi|bre bears to the quantity of fluid in the ve&s;&s;els, irretrievable mi&s;takes are com|mitted; and here I cannot but ob&s;erve how many ignorant conceited Coxcombs
<PB N="25" REF="23">ride out under a &s;hew of bu&s;ine&s;s with their lancet in their pocket, and make di&s;ea&s;es in&s;tead of curing them, drawing their weapon upon every occa&s;ion, right or wrong, and upon every complaint ery out, <HI>E-gad I mu&s;t have &s;ome of your blood,</HI> give the poor wretches a di&s;ea&s;e they never might have had, draining the body and the pur&s;e, torment them in this world, and &s;end them perhaps to another before their time, to keep them|&s;elves the longer from that day of rec|koning where they mu&s;t account for the quantity of innocent blood they have &s;hed in this World.</P>
<P>The Evacuation by vomiting is often a very nece&s;&s;ary one, e&s;pecially where a Nau&s;ea or an inclination to vomit ap|pears, but it is not to be ventured upon at all hazards, or with all &s;orts of Pa|tients, many circum&s;tances may forbid its u&s;e, and plainly contraindicate it, or it may be nece&s;&s;ary previou&s;ly to le&s;&s;en the quantity by bleeding, after which by the action of vomiting the &s;tomach
<PB N="26" REF="24">is not only di&s;charg'd of its di&s;agreeable load, but by the univer&s;al &s;hock it gives to the &s;olids, it rai&s;es their action, at|tenuates the fluids, drives through ob|&s;tructions, and &s;its and prepares the hu|mours in general for their &s;everal &s;ecre|tions.</P>
<P>Another Evacuation in the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration is bli&s;tering, and which is frequently of very great u&s;e, not &s;o much on account of the di&s;charge, as its property of &s;timulating and adding to the force of the fibres, its tempering the vi&s;cidities, and &s;eparating the pre|ternatural cohae&s;ions; it makes a revul|&s;ion of the humours from a particular part, <HI>viz.</HI> from the brain, by which a Delirium or perhaps a Phrenzy, not un|common in this Fever, is either prevent|ed or taken off. But pointing out ge|ral rules for the u&s;e of bli&s;ters will not do for particular ca&s;es, nor is it &s;afe up|on all occa&s;ions to lay on bli&s;ters before Evacuations of other kinds have pre|pared the humours in &s;ome mea&s;ure and
<PB N="27" REF="25">pav'd the way to them; and I believe it has often been a ca&s;e, whereby an un|skilful management of bli&s;ters in&s;tead of relieving the brain, by the great &s;timu|lation upon the &s;olids, the blood and humours have been thrown in upon its tender ve&s;&s;els with &s;uch a force, as they have not been able to bear, e&s;pecially if the bli&s;ters have been accompanied as they often, I may &s;ay, almo&s;t always are, with other violently warm &s;timulating medicines.</P>
<P>The Evacuation by &s;weating, I mean that artificially made, demands our con|&s;ideration in the next place, its being attempted at all adventures, and with|out good rea&s;on is often of the wor&s;t con&s;equence to the Patient.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever has for its Cau&s;e an accumulation of fluids in too great proportion to the le&s;&s;en'd ela&s;tic force of the &s;olids, and tho&s;e be|come an heavy &s;izey putrid and inactive ma&s;s, and peculiarly vi&s;cid through the
<PB N="28" REF="26">great exhalations of their &s;iner and more fluid parts by the extream heats of the &s;ea&s;on, who is there but &s;ees how pre|po&s;terous it is to be flinging in violently hot &s;udorifics, in this pre&s;ent &s;tate of the fluids thus unprepar'd for them? Hence Petechiae, &s;pots and eruptions of &s;everal kinds, if not before by nature made, are now by this method propell'd and di|&s;tributed to the &s;urface from a &s;tagnating putrid ma&s;s; hence the Deliria we fre|quently meet with among the&s;e Patients. But that &s;uch medicines as the&s;e may not with &s;afety be made u&s;e of in &s;ome time or other of the di&s;temper cannot be a&s;|&s;erted, but it mu&s;t be at a time that the fluids are properly prepared and fitted for this particular excretion.</P>
<P>So much for general vi&s;ible Evacuati|ons. It may be expected perhaps I &s;hould give a detail of the materials or medicines which are to be made u&s;e of in the foregoing de&s;cribed ca&s;es, but that was not in my intention, as thinking the giving Recipe's and &s;trings of medi|cines
<PB N="29" REF="27">can be of no u&s;e to the real Phy|&s;ician, &s;o it might be of ill con&s;equence, and made an ill u&s;e of by the Pretender; I apprehend I have given &s;uch hints, and made &s;uch ob&s;ervations through the cour&s;e of the&s;e Papers, as to lay down a foundation for a rational method of cure in the pre&s;ent Epidemic Fever. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, as I hinted before, in the affair of bleeding, that a di&s;ea&s;e is often brought on a patient by an officious ill judging, ill-timing hand, rather than any pre&s;ent one removed, in like manner it falls out, that by the admini&s;tration of many medicines improperly and un|skilfully apply'd, the di&s;ea&s;e is made a <HI>new</HI> one, and quite chang'd from what it was at fir&s;t; and we need not wonder at the ill &s;ucce&s;s that is ob&s;erved from the variety and great quantities of A|lexipharmacs (as they are termed) pour'd down the throat in an undi&s;tingui&s;hing manner, perhaps more for the &s;ake of the Apothecary than the Patient, I &s;ay we need not be &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Pa|tient
<PB N="30" REF="28">yield to the burthen, and fall a victim to the di&s;ea&s;e of Medicine.</P>
<P>Since we have pointed out a method of cure, and of relieving the Patient in this Epidemic Fever, it will not be di&s;|plea&s;ing I imagine, to recommend a me|thod of prevention; and as we have proved, that health in a great mea&s;ure depends upon a due balance, and ju&s;t proportion between the &s;olids and fluids of our bodies, that is, between the force or &s;trength of the former, and the quan|tity or quality of the latter, &s;o 'tis our highe&s;t concern, and ought to be our principal Care, to endeavour as near as we can to keep to this &s;tandard. Since the immoderate heats of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, as we have rea&s;on to think, have &s;o con&s;tituted the air, whereby it has a tendency of taking off that Equilibrium we have been de&s;cribing, and which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for health, by &s;ink|ing the &s;olids, and increa&s;ing the quan|tity of fluids, &s;o it &s;eems to be highly nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hould le&s;&s;en this quantity,
<PB N="31" REF="29">and rai&s;e that force. And in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances there &s;eems to be no &s;afer or &s;peedier method of prevention than pre|viou&s;ly to empty the ve&s;&s;els by lo&s;ing &s;ome blood, and then to u&s;e the cold bath, which has un&s;peakably good ef|fects, in giving force to the fibres, where|by the blood is enabled to drive through all ob&s;tructions, to &s;cour the Glands, to attenuate the vi&s;cidities, and prevent a &s;tagnating putrid &s;tate, the cau&s;e, nay the very e&s;&s;ence of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Gentle exerci&s;e, &s;uch as riding on hor&s;eback, or in a Coach, or walking at proper &s;ea&s;ons, not to &s;weat much, a temperate way of living, tho' not too low, but indulging now and then in a gla&s;s of &s;ome generous liquor, all con|tribute to keep up an Equilibrium, and prevent the reigning di&s;temper. In a word, a due and regular u&s;e and appli|cation of the non-naturals is the mo&s;t likely means to pre&s;erve health, &s;uch as calming the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Affections</HI> of the mind, proportioning our <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> and
<PB N="32" REF="30">u&s;e of the <HI>Air</HI> to our &s;trength, and the <HI>Food</HI> we take in, not <HI>watching</HI> over much, but taking our u&s;ual moderate hours of &s;leep, and above all, taking care the natural <HI>Evacuations</HI> of every kind be not immoderate and to exce&s;s.</P>
