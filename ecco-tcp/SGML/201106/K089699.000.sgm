<P>THE following little Piece was ha&s;tily drawn up in the Year 1769, when the Heads of the Univer&s;ity announced their Intention of open|ing the <HI>Radcliffe</HI> Infirmary with an Encoenia. They afterwards dropped this De&s;ign. But the Author having lately employed a lei&s;ure Hour in correcting and &s;omewhat enlarging his ORATION, now begs Leave to lay it before the Public.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION ON THE UTILITY OF PUBLIC INFIRMARIES.</HEAD>
<P>IF we clo&s;ely examine the moral Qualities, which are denominated Virtues, and which Mankind have agreed to honour with Applau&s;e, we &s;hall find that almo&s;t all regard Man, as he is a &s;ocial Being, born to do good Offices to others. Upon this Principle it is found likewi&s;e, that our Approbation of virtuous Actions, is u&s;ually pro|portioned to the Extent of their Influence and Utility. Thus a Legi&s;lator and a Patriot mu&s;t ever be more admired than a Man of Prudence, Wi&s;dom, and Integrity, exerted only in the contracted Sphere of private Life.</P>
<P>BUT of all the &s;ocial Qualities, Benevolence is the mo&s;t immediately u&s;eful. It is indeed the Source of all the re&s;t,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and naturally induces that great End and Cement of Society, mutual Beneficence. This Virtue too, like all others, becomes more illu&s;trious in Proportion as its Con&s;equences are more extended.</P>
<P>To the &s;trong and univer&s;al Prevalence of this amiable Quality it is owing, that the Magi&s;trates and Legi&s;lators, in mo&s;t Countries, have in&s;tituted &s;ome Provi&s;ion to alle|viate the Mi&s;eries of the Indigent and Helple&s;s. This al&s;o, in the opulent, the liberal, and the ingenuous, has pro|duced the undertaking of Works of the pre&s;ent Kind, of Ho&s;pitals, Infirmaries, and Receptacles for the Relief of various Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>INDEED the Goods of Fortune, the Means of Health and Felicity, which come to the Rich by Inheritance or Acqui&s;i|tion, are not their &s;ole exclu&s;ive Property. The Poor have a Claim of Right for their Share. And the Relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them and the Rich, certainly obliges the latter to a&s;&s;i&s;t them under Di&s;ea&s;es, Ca&s;ualties, and heavy Calamities.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>IT perhaps may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to remind the Sons of Ea&s;e and Affluence, that the laborious Poor not only form the Bulk of the Nation, but are likewi&s;e the Part on which the Strength, the Pro&s;perity, and even the Exi&s;tence of the Whole depends. To them, as di&s;tributed through the humbler and more toil&s;ome Offices of Society, we owe all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and all its Conveniencies. The Labour of the Hu&s;bandman, the Manufacturer, and Me|chanic, is confe&s;&s;edly e&s;&s;ential to the Welfare of the Community; and yet a pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and their Families is their only Recompence. Every Sun ri&s;es to light them to their fatiguing Labour, which often ends not with the clo&s;ing Day. They contentedly toil on from Youth to Age, and while they perhaps repo&s;e their weary Limbs in the Hut of Poverty, &s;ee their Sons entering upon the &s;ame Cour&s;e of unnoticed Hard&s;hips and unre|warded Indu&s;try. Surely then their Lot at the be&s;t is not to be envied. But what a deplorable Change mu&s;t they feel, &s;hould they be attacked by any one of that Ho&s;t of Di&s;ea&s;es which make &s;uch Havock among&s;t the human Race? That Strength which &s;upported them in their daily Toil, now
<PB N="8" REF="6">fails them; that Health of Body and Ea&s;e of Mind which lightened the Burthen of Poverty, are now no more. Sickne&s;s, by di&s;abling them from earning a Sub&s;i&s;tence, occa&s;ions Want, and Want excludes the Means of Reco|very from Sickne&s;s. The two greate&s;t of natural Evils united, double each other's Weight, and accumulate Di&s;tre&s;s. Thus, in more &s;ultry Climes, the &s;corching Sun every where oppre&s;&s;es the fainting Traveller with his Beams, but &s;hould they be reflected from the Declivity of &s;ome barren Mountain, the Heat becomes intolerable, the very Air is tainted, and all Nature &s;ickens.</P>
<P>WITHOUT Health, without the Means of recovering it, or even of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, whither then mu&s;t the&s;e abandoned Sons of Affliction look for Relief? To the ca&s;ual Munifi|cence of private Benefactors? Uncertain, hopele&s;s Pro&s;pect! To their own Friends or Kindred? Alas! their Pity is all they have to be&s;tow. To their Children (&s;ince &s;ome of them no doubt are Fathers of Families)?&mdash;But here the Scene is truly calamitous. The little Mourners &s;tand round the &s;ick Bed of their Parent, and while they feel, deeply feel for his
<PB N="9" REF="7">Sufferings, cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to their own. He turns an hopele&s;s Eye towards them, perceives them in Want of that Bread which he had hitherto provided for them by his Labour, perceives them foreta&s;ting tho&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es which, at his Death, are to be their &s;ad Inheritance.</P>
<P>BUT waving the&s;e peculiar Circum&s;tances of Mi&s;ery, let us only reflect on that Variety of Di&s;tempers to which Poverty is expo&s;ed, without the Means of Relief. And in this View, what Objects of Compa&s;&s;ion pre&s;ent them&s;elves before us? Objects which mu&s;t awe the Pride of Man, and awaken his Tenderne&s;s.</P>
<Q><L>"Numbers of all di&s;eas'd, all Maladies,</L>
<L>Of gha&s;tly Spa&s;m, or racking Torture, Qualms</L>
<L>Of heart-&s;ick Agony, all feverous Kinds,</L>
<L>Convul&s;ions, Epilep&s;ies, fierce Catarrhs,</L>
<L>Inte&s;tine Stone and Ulcer, Colic Pangs,</L>
<L>Demoniac Phrenzy, moping Melancholy,</L>
<L>And Moon-&s;truck Madne&s;s, pining Atrophy,</L>
<L>Mara&s;mus, and wide-wa&s;ting Pe&s;tilence,</L>
<L>Drop&s;ies and A&s;thmas, and joint-racking Rheums."</L></Q>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>WHAT a Group of human Mi&s;eries! All various, yet all languid, deformed, and loath&s;ome. A benevolent Mind &s;hudders at their very Names. But could you have the wretched Sufferers before your Sight, could you mark the dire to&s;&s;ing of re&s;tle&s;s Angui&s;h, and li&s;ten to the deep Groans of De&s;pair, &s;urely every Eye would drop a &s;ympa|thizing Tear, and every gentle Heart would bleed.</P>
<P>IT may ju&s;tly be a Matter of Wonder that our civil Police has made none, or at lea&s;t no adequate Provi&s;ion for the Poor when labouring under the&s;e Calamities. They are the Servants of the Public, and therefore entitled to its Protection. Be&s;ides, a &s;tronger Tye &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. They who&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es thus loudly implore our Compa&s;&s;ion, what are they? Want, indeed, and Misfortunes have much di&s;|gui&s;ed them, and Mi&s;ery hath worn them to the Bone. Yet they have the &s;ame Nature, and except a few accidental variable Di&s;tinctions, are the &s;ame with us. They have an Original alike divine, a Mind alike intelligent. To be a Man, and to be mi&s;erable, is a &s;ufficient Claim on the generous and humane. Shall we then leave tho&s;e to peri&s;h, whom it is the Intere&s;t of their Country, and the Duty of
<PB N="11" REF="9">all Mankind to a&s;&s;i&s;t and pre&s;erve? Medicine, and every other Relief in the Calamity of bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, are natural Provi&s;ions for the pre&s;ent indigent and infirm State of the Sons of Men. In Spite, indeed, of all the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances, Sickne&s;s will &s;till &s;lay its Thou&s;ands, and thin the World by its de&s;troying Sword. But nothing &s;urely can more contradict the Order of Nature and the Will of Providence, than that Numbers &s;hould fall Victims, not &s;o much to the Fury of Di&s;ea&s;e, as to the Neglect and Cruelty of tho&s;e who ought to &s;upply them with the Means of Recovery. Yet how many of our &s;ick and di&s;abled Poor mu&s;t be left to this unhappy Lot, if no public Infirmaries are e&s;tabli&s;hed to receive them?</P>
<P>THESE, indeed, open their friendly Doors for &s;uch poor de&s;erted Wretches, the&s;e bind up their Wounds, and exert all the Power of Medicine to heal their Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>WHERE no charitable A&s;ylums of this Kind are erected, it is a common Re&s;ource with our &s;ick Poor, though a fatal one, to apply to mercenary and pernicious Empirics, who&s;e Ignorance either immediately deprives them of their
<PB N="12" REF="10">Lives, or injures their Healths beyond Reparation. But in the&s;e Hou&s;es of Charity they are &s;ure to find able Phy&s;i|cians, and every Thing provided for their Conveniency and Cure that Art can &s;ugge&s;t or Munificence &s;upply.</P>
<P>PUBLIC Infirmaries are not only the be&s;t, but the only Means by which the nece&s;&s;itous can procure the &s;everal Kinds of A&s;&s;i&s;tance which their various bodily Di&s;ea&s;es require. In large commercial Towns, what other Provi&s;ion can be made again&s;t tho&s;e Ca&s;ualties which &s;o frequently happen to the poor labouring Part of the Inhabitants, or to the &s;till more unfortunate Stranger?</P>
<P>HERE give me leave to add to the&s;e general Advan|tages, one peculiar to this Place. A Fa&s;hion has of late prevailed, to &s;end &s;uch of our Youth as are de&s;igned for the Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ic, to foreign Academies, which, though far inferior to our own in every other Re&s;pect, have been thought &s;uperior in this. The Rea&s;on of a Cu&s;tom &s;o injurious to the Intere&s;t of our Country, and the Honour of our Seats of Learning, is far from being &s;atisfactory; how|ever, by the pre&s;ent In&s;titution, the very Shadow of it is
<PB N="13" REF="11">removed. Important as every public Infirmary mu&s;t be, the Importance of this is &s;till more exten&s;ive. It affords not only the be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;ick and di&s;abled, but likewi&s;e the be&s;t Opportunities of Ob&s;ervation and Improve|ment to young Students in the medical Science, on who&s;e future Skill &s;o much depends. It has the happy, the &s;in|gular Excellence of at once relieving the Mi&s;ery of Indivi|duals, and making that Mi&s;ery beneficial to the Community. We now, at length, may ju&s;tly boa&s;t that ours is the mo&s;t compleat Seminary in <HI>Europe</HI> for &s;o important a Study, whether we regard Botany, Anatomy, the Theory or Practice of Medicine. To no Profe&s;&s;ion is Learning more nece&s;&s;ary: and here Students can be&s;t con&s;ult the rich Trea&s;ures of Antiquity, and the Parents of the healing Art: here they may add every liberal Accompli&s;hment, and acquire that general and exten&s;ive Knowledge for which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phy&s;icians are de&s;ervedly di&s;tingui&s;hed. When we con&s;ider the general and local Advantages of the Infir|mary here erected, what public Honours and Benefits may we not date from this au&s;picious Aera? May we not foretell, that as our <HI>Alma Mater</HI> already reckons in the li&s;t of her
<PB N="14" REF="12">Sons, the greate&s;t Names in Medicine, &s;he will now add to the glorious Catalogue, and &s;ee in her Train future <HI>Linacres, Willis's, Radcliffes,</HI> and <HI>Friends,</HI> who &s;hall emulate the Science and Reputation of tho&s;e who have gone before them?</P>
<P>BUT enough perhaps has been &s;aid to prove how much the&s;e In&s;titutions concern the public Intere&s;t and Honour: Indeed one would think it impo&s;&s;ible that any Per&s;ons &s;hould object to, or refu&s;e &s;upporting the&s;e excellent Under|takings, which are &s;o beneficial in all their Views: one would think it, I &s;ay, impo&s;&s;ible. But if any &s;uch &s;hould be, with &s;uch we will not contend. Let Avarice refu&s;e its A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, if po&s;&s;ible, its Applau&s;e.</P>
<P>THOUGH publick Infirmaries have political Advantages &s;o undeniable and &s;elf-evident, yet we may &s;afely affirm that they &s;tand on a firmer Ba&s;is, that they are &s;upported by Arguments &s;tronger than the Deductions of Rea&s;on; Arguments which every generous Brea&s;t mu&s;t feel. When we reflect on the Malignity of the Di&s;ea&s;es, the Weight
<PB N="15" REF="13">of the complicated Afflictions which they are intended to relieve, we are, we cannot but be intere&s;ted and di&s;po&s;ed to compa&s;&s;ionate the Sufferers, partly from the Con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of being liable to the &s;ame Evils, and partly from thy nobler Impul&s;es, O Benevolence! Here the truly humane Mind, like a well-tuned In&s;trument of Mu&s;ick, obeys the &s;udden Touches of Pity, and the &s;weet Harmony of its &s;ocial Affections, wholly pa&s;&s;ive in the Sympathy of its own Goodne&s;s. While the Rich and Powerful indulge the tender Sen&s;ations of Humanity, and promote &s;uch well-plann'd Works of Beneficence as the pre&s;ent In&s;titution, they at once communicate Happine&s;s to others, and inexpre&s;&s;ibly augment their own. They feel, that they are obeying the Dictates of pure&s;t Nature, and wi&s;e&s;t Rea&s;on; that they are fulfilling the Ends of So|ciety, and the Will of its great Author, who&s;e darling Attribute is Mercy, who&s;e very E&s;&s;ence is Love. Mo&s;t wi&s;ely did he di&s;tribute Men into the&s;e &s;ubordinate Ranks, and implant the&s;e generous Principles.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;"He form'd a Whole, the Whole to ble&s;s,</L>
<L>On mutual Wants built mutual Happine&s;s."</L></Q>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<P>WHATEVER may be the Vices of the pre&s;ent Age, the mo&s;t cen&s;orious Cynick mu&s;t allow that it has its Share of that Philanthropy and Tenderne&s;s which we would here recommend. Hi&s;tory informs us that it was the barbarous Policy of &s;ome ancient States to expo&s;e Infants if infirm, to abandon di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons, and even to de&s;troy tho&s;e who were rendered u&s;ele&s;s to the Community by Age and Decrepitude. But poli&s;hed Times and Nations are Strangers to &s;uch unfeeling Sentiments. A Di&s;po&s;ition to Compa&s;&s;ion and to Offices of Kindne&s;s will ever gain Ground in Proportion to Civilization, and improved Ele|gance of Manners. Perhaps this Virtue expands it&s;elf mo&s;t, when the Powers of the Mind are &s;oftened by Luxury, and all other Virtues are in the Wane. It is certain that the earlie&s;t Societies had le&s;s of it; Warriors and Heroes were their greate&s;t Characters.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this may be, I need not he&s;itate to congra|tulate my Country, &s;ince a bountiful and beneficent Spirit is, and has ever been its national Characteri&s;tick. For this, I may appeal even to the ruder Ages of Ignorance
<PB N="17" REF="15">and Super&s;tition, to tho&s;e ho&s;pitable and intentionally Religious, to tho&s;e venerable and princely Foundations, over who&s;e general undi&s;tingui&s;hed Ruins, Humanity and Piety mu&s;t for ever mourn. Through the mi&s;taken Zeal of our Ance&s;tors, the&s;e abounded more in our I&s;le than in any other Chri&s;tian Country. And if at their Di&s;&s;o|lution, the&s;e noble Edifices and Endowments had been applied to the U&s;es which the publick Intere&s;t required; Poverty, Sickne&s;s, and decrepit Age had never wanted an A&s;ylum, nor had the &s;acred Will of the Dead been &s;o flagrantly violated, or their A&s;hes &s;o impiou&s;ly di&s;turbed. Some of them it mu&s;t be owned in the Capital, by the Care and Earne&s;tne&s;s of an excellent Prelate, were &s;aved from the &s;acrilegious Talons of Court-Harpies, and con|&s;ecrated to the Relief of Mi&s;ery and Di&s;ea&s;e. But &s;o &s;mall was the Number, that it &s;eemed only to point out how much might and ought to have been done, had the lea&s;t Degree of publick Spirit, Ju&s;tice, or Honour influenced tho&s;e infamous Plunderers. Here then was lo&s;t the grand Opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing Receptacles for Di&s;tre&s;s in every Part of the Kingdom; and with equal Indignation
<PB N="18" REF="16">and Sorrow mu&s;t we look back on this deep, this indelible Stain of the Annals of our Reformation.</P>
<P>BUT now indeed we &s;ee fairer and brighter Pro&s;pects around us. A Spirit of Charity has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among&s;t all Ranks of People, among&s;t our Merchants, our Law|givers, and Nobles. The Liberality of our Forefathers is at lea&s;t equalled, and their Wi&s;dom in choo&s;ing Objects of that Liberality much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. In our Metropolis, almo&s;t every Species of Di&s;tre&s;s has been con&s;idered, pitied, and relieved.</P>
<P>THE de&s;erted Infant, who&s;e Misfortunes begin with its Exi&s;tence, meets that Redre&s;s for which it cannot petition.</P>
<P>THE unhappy Pro&s;titute, though &s;he has &s;urvived Inno|cence, finds &s;he has not &s;urvived Compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;ees an ho&s;pitable Retreat open for her Mi&s;ery and Shame, &s;ees a friendly Hand reached out to recover her &s;tumbling Feet to the Paths of Virtue and Peace.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="17">
<P>I MIGHT lead your Attention to that Man&s;ion within who&s;e Walls we behold the noble Fabrick of the Human Mind in its melancholy Ruins.&mdash;But this is a Sight of all others, the mo&s;t humiliating and painful. For Per&s;ons in a State &s;o con&s;ummately calamitous, the bleeding Pity of their Fellow-Citizens has made a munificent Provi&s;ion; &mdash;like the wounded Tree of <HI>Arabia,</HI> it weeps healing Balm.</P>
<P>WORTHY the Kings of a martial and generous People are tho&s;e royal Foundations, which receive the maimed Veteran, who has fought the Battles of his Country. There after all his Toils and Dangers he &s;its down to recite in the hone&s;t Loquacity of Age his hardy Deeds, and count his glorious Scars.&mdash;Brave Man! Peaceful &s;hall be the Evening of a Life expo&s;ed in the Service of <HI>Britain;</HI> &mdash;thy hoary Head is covered with well-earned Laurels!</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the various Infirmaries and Ho&s;|pitals for the Sick. Enough has already been &s;aid on the Excellence of the&s;e Hou&s;es of Mercy; and this is a Species
<PB N="20" REF="18">of patriotick Charity which has not been confined to our chief City. In other Parts of the Kingdom, Receptacles have been e&s;tabli&s;hed for tho&s;e who groan under the com|plicated Wretchedne&s;s of Poverty and Di&s;ea&s;e. And every one of this illu&s;trious Audience, every one (I doubt it not) will join me in wi&s;hing that the Streams of Beneficence may &s;till flow in &s;o u&s;eful a Channel, and that each of our provincial Towns may be ble&s;t with &s;uch an In&s;titution as that which <HI>Oxford</HI> at length enjoys.</P>
<P>WHILST the benevolent Speculati&s;t, the &s;incere Lover of his Country contemplates all the&s;e E&s;tabli&s;hments as the Monuments of national Virtue, and the Sources of innumerable Advantages to the State; the Lover of the Arts will con&s;ider them in an additional Point of View, will regard the Structures which are de&s;tined to the Pur|po&s;es of public Munificence as exhibiting to foreign Nations and to Po&s;terity, the mo&s;t &s;triking Proofs of the Ta&s;te and Magnificence of his Countrymen and Contem|poraries. The Hou&s;es of private Citizens (however opulent) are &s;eldom equal in the Beauty of their Structure
<PB N="21" REF="19">to Edifices of publick U&s;e and Contrivance. Where the Purpo&s;es of private and dome&s;tick Utility are only to be an&s;wered, the Genius of the Arti&s;t is nece&s;&s;arily circum|&s;cribed: He may indeed in the&s;e give Proofs of the Elegance of his Ta&s;te, and the Correctne&s;s of his Ideas; but from the Grand and Magnificent he is unavoidably precluded. But public Edifices of every Kind, have mo&s;t of all, contributed to di&s;play the Arts of De&s;ign in their full Lu&s;tre, in every Age and Country where tho&s;e Arts have been cultivated. To them we owe the Memory both of laudable Actions and of illu&s;trious Arti&s;ts; and by them the flouri&s;hing Nations of Antiquity have tran&s;|mitted to us the mo&s;t durable Records of their former Splendor and Greatne&s;s. To them the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t celebrated Cities of the World at this Day owe their chief Ornament.</P>
<P>THE Number of magnificent Churches, Colleges, and other publick Buildings throughout the Chri&s;tian Boun|daries, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Italy,</HI> have afforded an ample Field to the Genius of the Architect, the Statuary, and the
<PB N="22" REF="20">Painter. In one City only, the immen&s;e Fabrick of <HI>St. Peter</HI>'s, the Church of <HI>St. John Lateran,</HI> the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library, the Ho&s;pital of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and almo&s;t innumerable other Edifices of public U&s;e, will always pre&s;ent <HI>Rome,</HI> though fallen from her ancient Glories, as highly de&s;erving the Attention of the curious Traveller, and will immortalize the Names as well of tho&s;e Arti&s;ts who contributed their Talents to their Erection and Embel|li&s;hment, as of the Popes their Patrons.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in our own Country, and in every Nation where the Arts have fixed their Re&s;idence, their Influence is mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the Beauty and Gran|deur of publick Structures.</P>
<P>No City or People can be more indebted for Decora|tions of this Kind to the Munificence of a private Citizen, than we are to that admirable Per&s;on, from who&s;e exten|&s;ive Benefactions to this Seminary hath ari&s;en the De&s;ign and E&s;tabli&s;hment of an Infirmary in this Place. It would therefore be unju&s;t to clo&s;e the&s;e Reflections without &s;ome Tribute to his Memory.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<P>SUPERIOR to the common Views of a lucrative Profe&s;&s;ion, he e&s;teemed Wealth only valuable, as it enabled him to extend his good Offices to Mankind. Hence the va&s;t Fortune which he acquired by his &s;ingular Talents in the important Science of Phy&s;ick, was while he lived, a Fund of Charity and Beneficence; and the noble Beque&s;ts made by him at his Death to this Place of his Education, will continue the good Effects of his Liberality and his Grati|tude to the remote&s;t Times.</P>
<P>HE was a Man undoubtedly born for the Benefit and Ornament of his Country. His Virtues were of that Kind who&s;e Lu&s;tre will appear more amiable to the undazzled Eye of Wi&s;dom than the Trophies of Con|querors, and the &s;plendid Qualities of tho&s;e whom the ill-judging Multitude calls Great. Among&s;t the military Honours of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> the only one perhaps, with which a benevolent Man would wi&s;h to intwine his Brow, is the Civic Crown. And if he who pre&s;erved the Life of a &s;ingle Citizen de&s;erved to be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, what Crowns mu&s;t we weave for RADCLIFFE?&mdash;Such was
<PB N="24" REF="22">the Wi&s;dom which guided his beneficent Soul, &s;uch was the Propriety which regulated the Di&s;po&s;ition of his Wealth, that though dead he &s;till remedies the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Di&s;|ea&s;es of Men, and claims from them a daily-increa&s;ing Tribute of grateful Applau&s;e. The helple&s;s Objects, who are relieved from Mi&s;ery, or re&s;cued from Death by his Bounty, &s;hall hang around his Monument, the u&s;ele&s;s Crutch, and the votive Tablet.&mdash;Even tho&s;e on whom Providence has be&s;towed Affluence, though they are not affected by his Munificence, may be animated by his Example.</P>
<P>BUT it is unnece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on Merit &s;o tran&s;cen|dent, and I will not ob&s;cure his Prai&s;es by my feeble Attempts to di&s;play them. As the Benefits re&s;ulting from his well-directed and boundle&s;s Liberality, will a&s;&s;uredly extend to future Ages, we may &s;afely tru&s;t his Fame to Po&s;terity.</P>
