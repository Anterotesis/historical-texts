<DATELINE><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 27, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING lately met with as remarkable a Ca&s;e in Medical Electricity, as perhaps has yet appeared in the World, I give my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of &s;ending you an Account of it.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 1779, a young Per&s;on had the Misfortune to break her right Arm; which, as it was only a &s;imple Fracture was ea&s;ily reduced. But unhap|pily the Bandage being made too tight, the Arm was &s;oon invaded with a very &s;e|vere Pain, which in about twenty-four Hours became intolerable. A Surgeon happening to pa&s;s by the Hou&s;e in which the Patient then was, was called in, who immediately cut open the Bandage; when
<PB N="6" REF="7">great Part of the Arm appeared to be in a gangrenous State, and a Mortification had actually begun at the Elbow. The&s;e Symptoms however were without much Difficulty overcome by proper Applicati|ons, and the Cure of the Fracture went on very well; but from that Time the U&s;e of the Arm was lo&s;t. About three Months after this, the whole Arm and Hand began to wa&s;te, and gradually became an Object too full of Di&s;tre&s;s, to be beheld without exciting the Emotions of Surpri&s;e and Compa&s;&s;ion. A large and hard Knob was formed on the <HI>Fore-part</HI> of the Arm, a lit|tle above the Bend of the Elbow; and a|nother on the <HI>Hinder-&s;ide,</HI> near the upper Head of the Shoulder-Bone. The Frac|ture it&s;elf was near the Middle of the Bone. The whole Arm was &s;o weak, that when it hung by her Side, &s;he was not a|ble to rai&s;e it without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other: and when &s;upported in an horizon|tal Po&s;ture, the Wri&s;t fell as in a Pal&s;y. The Fingers were drawn backwards to &s;uch a Degree, that the Heads of the Finger-bones were forced out of the Sockets, where they join to the Palm of the Hand. At the &s;ame Time the other Joints of all the Fingers were contracted forwards, &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="8">that the Hand could not be opened or &s;hut; and according to her own Expre&s;&s;i|on, <HI>looked more like a Bird's Claw than a Hand.</HI> Both the Hand and Arm were al|mo&s;t void of Sen&s;ation, except of an obtu&s;e Pain at Times with a pricking Numbne&s;s, and &s;o emaciated as to become a meer Ske|leton. Every Application of Baths, Lini|ments, Fomentations, Catapla&s;ms, &amp;c. &amp;c. was tried without the lea&s;t Appearance of Succe&s;s; but it was ob&s;erved that tho&s;e of the a&s;tringent Kind, &s;eemed to be mo&s;t injurious: and the Calamity was much heightened by the melancholy Pro&s;pect of it's growing continually wor&s;e; to which was added, the Mortification of the Pati|ent's being a&s;&s;ured, that if &s;he did not find Relief in a very little Time, &s;he would have a compleatly withered Arm. In this deplorable Situation &s;he remained at the Beginning of <HI>March,</HI> 1780; when the Sur|geon under who&s;e Care &s;he was, advi&s;ed her to try the Effect of ELECTRICITY: adding, that he was thoroughly per&s;waded, that nothing within the Practice of Surge|ry could po&s;&s;ibly be of any Service to her. On this &s;he went to <HI>London,</HI> and after con|&s;ulting &s;everal Surgeons (&s;ome of whom very earne&s;tly recommended it, and others
<PB N="8" REF="9">as earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uaded her from it,) at length determined to put her&s;elf under the Direc|tion of Mr. LONG, of <HI>Little Compton Street, Soho;</HI> an experienced Practitioner, who has made Medical Electricity great Part of his Study and Employment for many Years. This Gentleman candidly told her, that her Ca&s;e appeared &s;o bad, that he could not give her any great Hopes of Succe&s;s; that &s;he might try if &s;he plea&s;ed, <HI>but if &s;he &s;hould receive Be|nefit, it would be next to a Miracle.</HI></P>
<P>Willing to try, though in a Manner without Hope, about the latter End of the &s;ame Month, &s;he began to enter on a Cour&s;e. At fir&s;t the Operation was carri|ed on very gently, as by drawing the e|lectric Stream, &s;mall Sparks, and &s;light Shocks, which were attended with no vi&s;i|ble Alteration. The Operator then pro|ceeded to electrify more &s;harply, after which &s;he &s;oon began to find &s;ome &s;mall Signs of Relief. Thus &s;he went on for a|bout &s;ix Months, continuing to be electri|fied every Day, Sundays excepted. The Method in general was, to draw Sparks with a large and powerful Machine on one Day, and to give &s;trong Shocks another Day; both which were continued as long
<PB N="9" REF="10">as the Patient could well endure it. I can|not determine how &s;trong the Shocks were, but by the Patient's own De&s;cription, &s;ome of them might be from a three-pint or two-quart Jar full charged. Sometimes the Number of Shocks amounted to one hun|dred and fifty, and even to two hundred, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible was the Arm at that Time. They were however &s;ufficient in Number and Strength, to make the whole Limb &s;well exceedingly. The Effect was, a &s;low Improvement of the Sen&s;ation, U&s;e, and Strength of the Limb; in&s;omuch; that by <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> 1780, her Condition was be|come quite happy, in Compari&s;on of what it had been. She could now lift the Arm without A&s;&s;i&s;tance, move the Elbow and Wri&s;t, and had &s;ome Power of moving the Fingers. The Heads of the Finger-bones were reduced into their Sockets; but the Hand remained about half open; without the Ability of extending or clenching the Fingers. The fle&s;hy Parts of the Arm were vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed in Bulk, as were tho&s;e of the Hand, though in a le&s;s Degree. At this Time her Affairs calling her into the Country, the Electri|fication was di&s;continued until about the Middle of <HI>January,</HI> 1781; when the Pa|tient
<PB N="10" REF="11">came into my Neighbourhood on a Vi&s;it to a Relation, and being within a convenient Di&s;tance of my Hou&s;e, an Opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf for carrying on the Operation; which I have endea|voured to perform, in the &s;ame Manner as it was practi&s;ed in <HI>London,</HI> as near as I can collect from the Patient's Account. It is now about &s;ix Weeks &s;ince I began, and I have the Satisfaction of perceiv|ing the Arm, and e&s;pecially the Hand, improved in a Degree that has exceeded my warme&s;t Expectation. The Power of clenching and extending the Fingers is wonderfully increa&s;ed, and the whole Limb better covered with Fle&s;h. About a Week ago, the Mu&s;cles on the Back of the Arm were (upon moving the Fin|gers) ob&s;erved, for the fir&s;t Time, to work under the Skin; and &s;he now began to make a feeble U&s;e of her Needle, to lace her Stays, and dre&s;s her Head: and re|mains in a plea&s;ing Expectation of re|ceiving further Benefit, from the Continu|ation of the &s;ame Means that have hi|therto been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully applied.</P>
<P>From the aforementioned Appearances (particularly the Wa&s;ting of the Limb) may we not conclude, that not only the
<PB N="11" REF="12">Mu&s;cles and Tendons of the <HI>Os Humeri,</HI> but al&s;o the great Nerve it&s;elf was injur|ed; e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered that the Patient is a Per&s;on of a very &s;lender Make; her Arms being &s;o exceeding &s;mall, that it would require no violent Pre&s;&s;ure to injure every Mu&s;cle, Tendon, and Nerve between the Skin and the Bone? There was undoubtedly a violent Ten&s;ion of the Mu&s;cles and Tendons, if not of the great Nerve it&s;elf, to which Electricity &s;eems to be a Remedy peculiarly adapt|ed. For my own Part, I never could perceive any great Benefit ari&s;ing from it, unle&s;s there was Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething of this Kind: and in Ca&s;es of this Nature, I do not recollect a &s;ingle In&s;tance in all my Practice, where it &s;ail|ed in affording more or le&s;s Relief. In a &s;light Burn or Scald, it is well known there is a Ten&s;ion on the Skin; and I will venture to &s;ay, that Electricity pro|perly applied will afford more immediate Ea&s;e to the Pain occa&s;ioned thereby, than any thing contained in the whole Materia Medica.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="13">
<P>FROM the Date of the foregoing Let|ter, till pa&s;t the Middle of April follow|ing, the Patient, who&s;e Ca&s;e is related therein, continued the Electrification, with little or no Alteration to the afflicted Limb; the Weather being all that Time very dry, and the Wind North, or North-ea&s;t. But about the <HI>21&s;t,</HI> or <HI>22nd,</HI> the Weather becoming of a Sudden re|markably mild and &s;oft, as remarkable and &s;udden a Change was experienced by her, which exceedingly flattered our Hopes: the Numbne&s;s and pricking Sen|&s;ation, which had never cea&s;ed from the Time the Misfortune happened, was now entirely gone off: but as the fine mild Weather did not la&s;t long, and the Wind returned into the North-ea&s;t, the di&s;agree|able Numbne&s;s returned with it; and has ever &s;ince continued in a greater or le&s;s Degree, in proportion as the Air has been more or le&s;s cold, &s;harp, or dry.</P>
<P>It is further ob&s;ervable, that the Limb during that Sea&s;on, and at Times ever &s;ince, has been more painful than when the Calamity was at the Wor&s;t: for from <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> 1779, till <HI>March,</HI> 1781, not|with&s;tanding the great Improvements made in the Summer of 1780, &s;o great was its
<PB N="13" REF="14">In&s;en&s;ibility, that all Kinds of Weather were alike to it: at the &s;ame Time the Patient began to be more &s;hy of the e|lectric Stroke, which obliged us to dimi|ni&s;h the Strength and Number of the Shocks. At the latter End of <HI>June,</HI> 1781, a free Per&s;piration fir&s;t appeared on the Hand and Fingers; and the Skin, which had hitherto wore a very &s;hining Poli&s;h, began to look more like that of the other Hand. On the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed on di&s;cover|ing the Fingers to have a much greater Power of Exten&s;ion than u&s;ual; &s;ince which Time, nothing has happened that requires particular De&s;cription. It is &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay in general, that the Limb continues improving in all Re&s;pects; that the&s;e Improvements are &s;eldom ob&s;erved to be regularly gradual, but appear mo&s;t|ly on a &s;udden; and after &s;uch long In|tervals, that we more than once began to de&s;pair of farther Succe&s;s: and that the Progre&s;s of the Cure is always very much advanced or retarded by good or bad Weather.</P>
<P>That the Powers of Nature alone were not &s;ufficient to work &s;uch wonderful Al|terations, as I have de&s;cribed, appears
<PB N="14" REF="15">very plain from the State of the Arm be|tween <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> 1780, and the Middle of <HI>January,</HI> 1781; in which Space of Time, the Patient declares &s;he did not perceive the Arm grow better or wor&s;e, during the Omi&s;&s;ion of Electricity. That Omi&s;&s;ion therefore &s;eems to be a very fortunate Circum&s;tance, as it enables us to determine, with a great Degree of cer|tainty, the va&s;t Importance of Electricity in Medicine.</P>
<P>AT the latter End of the la&s;t Summer, the Writer of the preceding Letter had an Opportunity of &s;eeing his Friend, to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed; when the Con|ver&s;ation turning on Medical Electricity, furni&s;hed &s;ome Hints that occa&s;ioned a &s;econd Letter, as follows.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 10, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>_OUR la&s;t Conver&s;ation, which turned chiefly on the different, and oppo&s;ite Succe&s;s of Elec|tricity on contracted Limbs, has to me been a Subject of much Con|&s;ideration: and I am not without Hope that &s;uch &s;eemingly various Effects may be accounted for, without imputing any uncertainty to the Operation it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We are to ob&s;erve, that a Limb or Joint may become contracted from op|po&s;ite Cau&s;es: either from a <HI>real Inju|ry,</HI> or <HI>morbid Contraction</HI> of a Mu&s;cle, or from the <HI>mere Relaxation</HI> of its An|tagoni&s;t. The Con&s;ideration of this Differ|ence you well know to be of the utmo&s;t Importance in Practice; and it often re|quires great Skill and Attention to make the Di&s;tinction. If a Mu&s;cle or Tendon be relaxed in any great Degree, its Anta|goni&s;t may, by its own natural contrac|tile Power, &s;hrink in &s;uch a Manner, as to give the Limb a &s;rightful Appear|ance: and if this &s;hould be mi&s;taken for
<PB N="16" REF="17">a Ten&s;ion or unnatural Contraction, the Treatment will con&s;equently be a per|ver&s;e one: and in&s;tead of Relief, the Pa|tient will mo&s;t probably find his Malady increa&s;ed. Hence we may &s;ee why the &s;ame Method of Treatment &s;hall &s;ome|times &s;ucceed, and &s;ometimes fail, in Ca&s;es apparently the &s;ame: and al&s;o why Complaints &s;eemingly different, &s;hall of|ten yield to the very &s;ame Medicines: and hence may ari&s;e that Uncertainty of Succe&s;s &s;o frequently attributed to Electricity by tho&s;e who are no Friends to it. Electricity as well as other Me|dicines, may be u&s;ed contrary to the true Intention of Cure. There is how|ever one happy Circum&s;tance attending it, viz. That if it &s;hould happen to be u&s;ed improperly (unle&s;s in a very im|prudent Manner,) there is not &s;o much Danger in it as may be imagined. A fair Proof of this, is that noted Ca&s;e, menti|oned by divers Writers, of a Girl who had a Pal&s;y in her right Arm, which was twice increa&s;ed by electric Shocks, and as often re&s;tored to the State in which it was before Electrification. Now if we con&s;ider Electricity as a Relaxer of the Solids; we may, I pre&s;ume, rea|&s;onably
<PB N="17" REF="18">enough conclude the true State of that Ca&s;e to be this. The fir&s;t Com|plaint was a Relaxation, con&s;equently the Electricity was ill applied. Yet not|with&s;tanding, as the Accounts declare, the Shocks were pretty fevere, it did but a temporary Damage; for the Fibres, al|though much injured before, had Ela&s;ti|city &s;ufficient to recover their former de|bilitated State. Whence we may infer, that in Ca&s;es of Uncertainty, a moderate Degree of Electricity may, nay &s;ometimes ought to be applied, were it only to find out, whether the Di&s;tortion aro&s;e from an <HI>unnatural Ten&s;ion</HI> of one Mu&s;|cle, or <HI>an unnatural Di&s;ten&s;ion of ano|ther.</HI> Hence al&s;o appears a Rea&s;on why, even in Ca&s;es wherein Electricity is pro|perly applied, it can afford but a tem|porary Relief: as in Per&s;ons who&s;e Fi|bres are become habitually rigid, from the &s;everal Cau&s;es of Time, Heats, Colds, Labour, Strains, hard Drinking, &amp;c. &amp;c. In &s;uch Subjects, nothing more than a temporary Relief can rea&s;onably be ex|pected; becau&s;e the dry, impervious Fi|bres will inevitably return to their rigid State, for Want of that vital Warmth, and lubricating Moi&s;ture which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="18" REF="19">to pre&s;erve their Flexibility. But in young and healthy Per&s;ons, the con|tracted &s;hall be re&s;tored to their due Tone (provided the Injury be not too great,) of which there are many authen|tic Proofs. And it has often happened, that when the Injury has been too great to admit of a perfect Cure, a partial one has been obtained, which never relap&s;ed; and this after the mo&s;t ap|proved Remedies had been tried in vain. From all which I infer, that where there is already too great a Relaxation of the Solids, Electricity is at be&s;t but u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Experience proves Electricity to be a great Promoter of the purulent Di&s;charge in I&s;&s;ues, Bli&s;ters, &amp;c. which Di&s;charge ari&s;es from the Relaxation of the Mouths of the cuticular Ve&s;&s;els, after the Ten|&s;ion is de&s;troyed: for otherwi&s;e, they di&s;charge only a thin watery Humour, or rather no Moi&s;ture at all. From whence it is plain, that Electricity ought not to be admini&s;tred in Fluxes proceeding from Weakne&s;s, except (as &s;ometimes happens) there be a Ten&s;ion on the injured Ve&s;&s;els. Mr. CAVALLO ob&s;erves, that before Flux|es di&s;cover any Signs of Amendment from Electricity, they appear to be increa&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<P>BUT perhaps you will &s;ay, "If Elec|tricity be &s;o efficacious in de&s;troying Ten&s;ions as is pretended, it &s;hould &s;eem to be a probable Means of Cure for ardent Fevers, Pleuri&s;ies, inflammatory Rheumati&s;ms, and &s;uch Kind of Di&s;or|ders, in which there is a manife&s;t Ten|&s;ion on the Ve&s;&s;els."&mdash;But it ought to be con&s;idered, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e, there is &s;omething more than <HI>bare Ten|&s;ion;</HI> there is a <HI>latent Cau&s;e</HI> which pro|duces and continues the Ten&s;ion, and counteracts the Operation of the Electri|city. Electricity will &s;oon remove the Ten&s;ion and Pain attending a &s;light Burn or Scald: here the Cau&s;e of the Ten&s;i|on and Pain, i. e. the Fire or &s;calding Liquor, has already cea&s;ed to act upon the affected Part; and the Cau&s;e being taken away, the Effect is &s;oon made to cea&s;e. On the other Hand, it can give little or no Relief in Bites or Stings of venemous Animals, &s;o long as the Cau&s;e of the Ten&s;ion and Pain, i. e. the in|jected Poi&s;on, remains. Indeed I cannot &s;ay, what a long continued U&s;e of Elec|tricity might bring about, by relaxing the Capillaries and promoting Per&s;piration, or the impeded Circulation: or how far
<PB N="20" REF="21">it may contribute to di&s;&s;olve the Vi&s;cid|ities of the Blood and Humours: but as &s;uch tedious Operations are, in the&s;e Ca&s;es, hardly practicable, on account of the Pain, Weakne&s;s, and Impatience of the Sick, it &s;eems to be &s;carce worth our While to con&s;ider much about it. My humble Opinion is, that &s;uch Attempts would &s;erve only to bring a very valu|able Acqui&s;ition in Medicine into Di&s;re|pute.</P>
<P>In old callous Ulcers, Electricity is &s;aid to have proved efficacious: in &s;uch, I pre&s;ume, as were owing to too tight and continued Bandages, or other Mi&s;|management, rather than a bad Habit of Body. But for the Rea&s;ons given be|fore, I would not wi&s;h a Practitioner to ri&s;k the Credit of his Art, by applying it to &s;uch as ari&s;e from a Malignity of the Humours.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid to be a good Remedy for &s;ore Throats; and I verily believe it may: but it mu&s;t be for &s;uch as &s;pring from &s;ome recent Cau&s;e, (&s;uch as &s;udden Gold, &amp;c.) which may bring on a Ten|&s;ion, that may be removed before the Humours become vitiated.</P>
<P>In like Manner, perhaps, it may be
<PB N="21" REF="22">of wonderful Service in preventing the excruciating Pains of the Rheumati&s;m; I mean of the true, acute, inflammatory, rheumatic Fever; a Di&s;temper which &s;eems to have it's Beginning in the So|lids; viz. a Ten&s;ion cau&s;ed by &s;udden Cold, e&s;pecially after the Body has been much heated.&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved by Men of great Skill, that this is a Di&s;or|der that &s;eldom or never attacks any but tho&s;e who are otherwi&s;e &s;ound and heal|thy. And for my own Part, I doubt not, but that whoever is afflicted with it, might (if he paid due Attention) tell when, and how he contracted it. Sup|po&s;ing this to be true, it is highly pro|bable that, could the Ten&s;ion of the Fi|bres be removed before the Blood and Humours become inflamed, the Di&s;ea&s;e would be eradicated while in Embryo: for a little Experience might be &s;uffici|ent to convince any one, of the great Power Electricity has to take off that Rigidity, &s;o commonly felt after violent Exerci&s;e in a cold Air.</P>
<P>So great a Stre&s;s has of late been laid on drawing or throwing the electric Stream with Points, that Shocks, and e|ven
<PB N="22" REF="23">Sparks, have been almo&s;t laid a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s or dangerous. There are cer|tainly many Ca&s;es in which gentle Me|thods are highly proper, and the rough|er Kinds of Treatment both painful and dangerous: as when the affected Part is very tender, &s;uch as an Eye, Ear, &amp;c. al&s;o, if the Ten&s;ion be &s;light, or ea&s;ily removable, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to torment the Patient with &s;trong Shocks, or even Sparks. But when the Ten&s;ion is ob&s;ti|nate, and not &s;ituated in a tender Part, the Degree of Electricity ought to be proportioned thereto, as far as the Pati|ent can bear it. There are certainly many Ca&s;es, in which the very gentle Kinds of Electricity would &s;ignify little or nothing. I have often relieved very &s;light Burns or Scalds, by only drawing the Stream; but I had lately an Opportunity of ob|&s;erving that Method fail in a Scald that was &s;omewhat &s;evere: I drew the Stream a long Time to no Purpo&s;e; at length I proceeded to draw Sparks which &s;oon had the de&s;ired Effect. This Scald was &s;o great, that a Bli&s;ter aro&s;e before the Per&s;on who received it, could come to the Machine, although the Accident happened in the Hou&s;e. Electricity in this Ca&s;e, effected
<PB N="23" REF="24">no other Cure than relieving the Pain: the Bli&s;ter was healed as other Bli&s;ters u&s;ually are.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on who lives in a neighbouring Pari&s;h, about a Year ago, broke his Leg, and was confined to his Bed eleven Weeks. The Fracture being a bad one, he was obliged to lie all that Time, in one Po&s;ture; the Con&s;equence of which was, an <HI>Anchylo&s;is</HI> at the Knee of the &s;ame Leg; which continued for many Weeks after he left his Bed, without the lea&s;t perceiveable Alteration. As &s;oon as he was able to ride, he was brought to me, and electrified twice every Day for a Fortnight. The Method I u&s;ed was to draw Sparks, and give four or five moderate Shocks: i. e. from a pint Vi|al about one-third charged. The Succe&s;s an&s;wered our Expectation; every Opera|tion being attended with a vi&s;ible Im|provement, except one, wherein I pur|po&s;ely omitted the Shocks for the Sake of Experiment. At the End of the Fortnight, the Knee, which was at fir&s;t nearly &s;traight, was become &s;o flexible, that he could bring the Sole of his Foot to the Ground, while &s;itting in a com|mon Chair. He has been with me three
<PB N="24" REF="25">Times &s;ince, and not without more of le&s;s Improvement according to the State of the Weather, which I always found to be of great Importance towards a Cure. But the <HI>Grand Proof</HI> of the great Expediency, and even Nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;trong Shocks in ob&s;tinate Ten&s;ions of the larg|er Nerves and Tendons, was exhibited in the Ca&s;e of the contracted Arm, of which I have already given you an Ac|count.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid by an eminent Phy|&s;ician, a Friend to Medical Electricity, That he never knew the Cure advance, after the Patient had undergone &s;ix or &s;e|ven Times of Trial. With Submi&s;&s;ion, I think, that either the Patients were not proper Subjects for Electrification; or that the Electrification was not &s;ufficient|ly continued.</P>
<P>If the Rigidity, Ten&s;ion, &amp;c. be too &s;tubborn to admit of a perfect Cure on the forementioned Number of Trials, the Practitioner may almo&s;t depend upon it, that he will not ob&s;erve any farther Im|provement for a con&s;iderable Time; nay in &s;ome Ca&s;es for many Weeks. Of this I have already produced a remarkable In|&s;tance
<PB N="25" REF="26">in the Patient, who is the Subject of my fir&s;t Letter, and of whom I then took Notice, that the Improvements did by no Means proceed in a regular Man|ner, but by &s;udden Fits or Starts. And indeed I mu&s;t acknowledge, that had it not been for the Patient's amazing Per&s;e|verance, which I &s;ometimes took for Ob|&s;tinacy, the Affair had been long ago giv|en up. Something like this I have ob|&s;erved in another Ca&s;e, but that already related is &s;ufficient. And here I de&s;ire Leave to recommend one Thing to your &s;erious Attention; viz. To con&s;ider whe|ther, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, it be bet|ter to continue, the Electrification con|&s;tantly as a Preparative towards a farther Improvement: or, when it is found that the Part will &s;uffer no greater Degree of Di&s;|ten&s;ion for the Pre&s;ent, to let it re&s;t a While, that Nature may have Time to &s;upply the new-&s;tretched Fibres with Nou|ri&s;hment, and &s;it them for Di&s;ten&s;ion a|gain. This is an Object of great Impor|tance; for if (as I am mo&s;t inclined to believe) the Omi&s;&s;ion be no Hindrance to the Progre&s;s of the Cure, it will be hap|py for tho&s;e Patients who&s;e Occupations and Circum&s;tances, will not allow of a
<PB N="26" REF="27">long and con&s;tant Attendance, as well as for tho&s;e of all Degrees, who will in a great Mea&s;ure be freed from &s;uffering perpetually, a di&s;agreeable Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>From the foregoing Con&s;iderations we may di&s;cover the Rea&s;on why, even in Ca&s;es to which Electricity is well adapt|ed, it is more difficult to perfect a Cure, than to begin it; for at the fir&s;t Appli|cation, when the Fibres are in the mo&s;t &s;tiff and rigid State, the inflating or di&s;|tending Power of the Electricity will have the greate&s;t Influence upon them; the Effects of which will naturally de|crea&s;e, in proportion as the Fibres grow pliable: becau&s;e through their new-ac|quired Ela&s;ticity, they will become capa|ble of eluding the Force. A Smith, with a Stroke of his great Hammer or Sledge, can, without much Difficulty, bend or break a &s;tiff iron Bar of con&s;iderable Size; but if the Bar be fir&s;t made ela&s;tic, it will, in Proportion to the Degree of it's Ela&s;ticity, require a greater Degree of Vi|olence to produce the &s;ame Effect. Thus we may ea&s;ily account for an Ob&s;ervation made by the Generality of Electricians; viz. <HI>That Electricity, if not unrea&s;onbly applied, never injures an healthy Fibre:</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="28">and al&s;o why it is injurious to &s;uch, as through Weakne&s;s or Laxity, have lo&s;t the Power of recovering their Tone. And hence we may conclude, that the farther the Cure of a Contraction, Ten&s;ion, &amp;c. is advanced, the more &s;low will be it's fu|ture Progre&s;s; and con&s;equently that the electric Force ought under &s;uch Circum|&s;tances, (provided the Patient's Con&s;titu|tion will bear it) to be rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed. But as the Patient's Sen&s;ibility always increa&s;es as the Fibres be|come more ela&s;tic, it will, in many Ca&s;es, require a large Share of Re&s;olution and Per&s;everance to perfect the Cure, or even to make any con&s;iderable Advances to|wards rendering it compleat.</P>
<P>'THE Rea&s;on why &s;ome Sprains receive much Benefit from Electrization, and o|thers none at all, but rather Injury, is, becau&s;e &s;ome are attended with Ten&s;ions, others with Relaxation. Hence a Rea&s;on why the Cold Bath, and other Bracers, will Sometimes do much Good, and at other Times great Mi&s;chief.&mdash;One Even|ing, about a Year and a Half ago, the Servant Boy, who then lived with me, happened to &s;prain his Wri&s;t: the Cure
<PB N="28" REF="29">was attempted by Pumping, which was continued till the Wri&s;t was greatly &s;well|ed, with much Inflammation and Pain. As &s;oon as I was informed of the Acci|dent, I cau&s;ed the Pumping to cea&s;e, and directed the Hand and Wri&s;t to be bath|ed in warm Water. After the Pain and Inflammation were, by the&s;e Means, &s;ome|what abated, I electrified with Sparks and Shocks, which &s;oon reduced the Swelling much more, and the Pain was now become very tolerable. The next Morning the Warm Bath and Electrici|ty were repeated, and the Cure perfected. Here indeed I lo&s;t a fine Opportunity of trying the Efficacy of Electricity alone; but I was, at that Time, hardly got in|to this Train of Thinking. It however &s;erves to &s;hew; that Electricity and the Warm Bath belong to the &s;ame Cla&s;s; and that they may be &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed together. &mdash;I have al&s;o known Electri|city fail of curing a Sprain. &mdash;A Per&s;on, wringing &s;ome Cloaths out of the Water, &s;prained her Hand in &s;uch a Manner, that on the Back of it there aro&s;e a &s;mall Swelling, the &s;ame as is u&s;ually called, the Springing or Starting of a Tendon. It was &s;oft, and without Pain or Inflam|mation;
<PB N="29" REF="30">this was &s;everal Times electrifi|ed without Succe&s;s; but was &s;oon after cured by the Cold Bath and a Bandage.</P>
<P>Hence we may venture to conclude, that to Nervous Ca&s;es in general, Elec|tricity does not &s;eem to be well adapt|ed. So far indeed as weak Fibres are &s;ometimes liable to Ten&s;ion, as well as &s;trong ones, it will (if judiciou&s;ly admi|ni&s;tered) be attended with great Probabi|lity of Succe&s;s. But whoever expects E|lectricity to &s;trengthen a weak Habit, will mo&s;t certainly be deceived.</P>
<P>The Degree of Electricity, proper to be admini&s;tered at a Time, &s;hould be de|termined by the Degree of Ob&s;tinacy in the Ten&s;ion, Contraction, &amp;c. &mdash; the Strength, Weakne&s;s or Tenderne&s;s of the Part affected&mdash;the Age, Strength, Con&s;ti|tution, &amp;c. of the Patient, con&s;idered to|gether; as in the Admini&s;tration of other Medicines.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, the fol|lowing Quaere will naturally ari&s;e,&mdash;"If Electricity be indeed injurious to Weak|ne&s;s or Laxity, how comes it to be of Service in a Pal&s;y, the very Definition of which is, <HI>A lax Immobility of a Mu&s;|cle?"</HI> ANSW. Though a Pal&s;y be a lax
<PB N="30" REF="31">Immobility of a <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI> it frequently a|ri&s;es from Cau&s;es which a&s;tringe the <HI>Nerves;</HI> as Colds, a&s;tringent Aliments or Medicines, Ligatures, &amp;c. whence the Mu&s;cles become lax and collap&s;ed, and lo&s;e the Power of Motion, from the De|fect of the Influx of the vital Spirit into them; &s;o that it is not the <HI>relaxed Mu&s;cle,</HI> but the <HI>a&s;tringed Nerve</HI> that is the im|mediate Object of Cure or Relief in a Pal&s;y; becau&s;e from the Nerves, the Mu&s;|cles derive their Power of Motion. If the Pal&s;y proceed from Laxity or Debili|ty of the Nervous Sy&s;tem, doubtle&s;s E|lectricity will be &s;o far from Re&s;toring the Patient's Strength, that it will rather increa&s;e his Calamity.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the U&s;e of Electrome|ters, and the nice Di&s;tinction between me|tal and wooden Points, which at Pre&s;ent are con&s;idered as of great Importance, my Opinion is, that they are more cu|rious than u&s;eful. I am very &s;en&s;ible, that Electricity imprudently applied may do much Harm; but the very &s;evere Manner in which many Patients have been treated, without any fatal Con&s;e|quence, &s;ufficiently proves, that it is not
<PB N="31" REF="32">nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;pen&s;e it like a &s;trong chy|mical Preparation, of which Half a Grain too much may endanger Life. The Ca&s;e being once hit on, he mu&s;t be but an indifferent Practitioner; who cannot charge his Jar within the Bounds of Di&s;cretion, according to Circum&s;tances, be the Jar of whatever Size it may. He may take Care to begin with Moderation, and in|crea&s;e till he has found the Degree that will an&s;wer his Intention; and when he has once di&s;covered it, he may (if he has any tolerable Degree of Judgment) keep near enough to it to an&s;wer any good Purpo&s;e. Moreover, the Apparatus of an Electrometer, Wires, &amp;c. added to the Conductor, will cau&s;e &s;o great a Wa&s;te of the Electricity, as to render the Ope|ration extremely tedious; e&s;pecially, if the Globe or Cylinder be &s;mall, and a large Number of Shocks are required at a Time; which often happens in ob&s;ti|nate Ten&s;ions of the larger Nerves or Tendons. Add to this the di&s;agreeable Situation of the Patient, waiting with Terror for the Stroke, which happens &s;ooner or later, according as the Jar may acquire it's Charge; and that will be in proportion to the Number of Wires and
<PB N="32" REF="33">other Incumbrances; and as tho&s;e Incum|brances are more or le&s;s loaded with Du&s;t, Damps, &amp;c. My pre&s;ent Method of giving the Shock is this:&mdash;I take the Jar (a pint Vial in general) in my right Hand, and a metal Rod in my left, and having a Wire (not a Chain) of any convenient Length, form the Circuit by gra&s;ping one End of the Wire with the Rod, and the o|ther End with the Jar. Being thus pre|pared, I charge the Jar to what Height I judge proper; which may be done with certainty &s;ufficient: then pre&s;&s;ing the Rod again&s;t that Part of the Body which Oc|ca&s;ion may require, and advancing the Ball of the Jar to any other proper Part, I direct the Shock at Plea&s;ure. But if I &s;u&s;pect Danger of a Shock to my|&s;elf, from any Cau&s;e, that may turn the Force of the Electricity by Way of the Ground or Floor, as thick Cloaths, a paralytick Limb, the bare Earth, a brick or damp Floor; I in&s;ulate the Patient, or mount the Stool my&s;elf, which gives perfect Security. Sometimes I fa&s;ten one End of a Chain to one Part of the Pa|tient, and connecting the other End with the charged Vial, in one Hand only, give the Shock without Fear. By this Means,
<PB N="33" REF="34">at lea&s;t Two-thirds of the Labour and Wear, attending the U&s;e of Electrome|ters and Wires, are &s;aved; which is of no &s;mall Importance to tho&s;e who prac|tice much. With re&s;pect to Points, I could never di&s;cover but that metal Points would an&s;wer every Purpo&s;e, for which Points may be required: becau&s;e they may be made to operate in any Degree, that can po&s;&s;ibly be procured by tho&s;e made of Wood; and to exceed them ei|ther in Mildne&s;s or Sharpne&s;s. They are al&s;o more certain in their Operation, not being liable to grow moi&s;t or dry. The Operator may be furni&s;hed with as many as he plea&s;es; but in this, as in Shocks or Sparks, he mu&s;t be directed by the Feelings of his Patient, on whom he may rely, that he will not willingly bear e|nough to do him&s;elf any great Harm.</P>

<P>MR. FERGUSON, in his Introduction to Electricity, &s;ays, <Q>"I have often drawn Sparks from Chilblains, and have al|ways found they were cured thereby."</Q> I have often done the &s;ame, but never found it &s;ucceed. Were it certain, that Chilblains were curable by Electricity <HI>a|lone,</HI> it might furni&s;h an Argument that would be fatal to my chief Po&s;ition, viz. <HI>That Electricity is peculiarly adapted to the Removal of Rigidity, Ten&s;ion, &amp;c. but pernicious in Ca&s;es of Laxity.</HI> Now I pre&s;ume, Chilblains are allowed to be the Effect of <HI>Blood &s;tagnated in relaxed Ve&s;&s;els;</HI> few being &s;ubject to them except Children, and Per&s;ons of lax Habits. But perhaps it may be po&s;&s;ible to give &s;ome Account for the Mi&s;take;&mdash;It was that Gentleman's Method, (and a very proper One it is in all Ca&s;es, where an electri|cal Operation is performed,) to order the electrified Part to be kept very warm: and this alone was &s;ufficient for the Cure of the Chilblains, and that in a little Time too. Now an Objection &s;tarts of it's Accord,&mdash;"If Electricity be indeed a good Remedy for Ten&s;ions, it &s;hould, according to the Rule laid down by my|&s;elf, be a likely Means of Cure for the
<PB N="35" REF="36">Complaint of which we are &s;peaking, wherein there is a manife&s;t Ten&s;ion, as appears by the Inflammation and Hard|ne&s;s of the Part affected."&mdash;That there is &s;uch Ten&s;ion I readily admit; yet &s;till in|&s;i&s;t on it, that Electricity alone is not &s;ufficient for the Cure. For unle&s;s it could &s;trengthen the Part, alter the Ha|bit, or remove the a&s;tringing Cold along with the Ten&s;ion, there is nothing to pre|vent it's immediate Return: whereas a good warm Flannel, a double Pair of wor&s;ted Stockings, or whatever el&s;e may pre&s;erve the Part in &s;ufficient Warmth, will &s;eldom or never fail of an&s;wering e|very Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ELECTRICITY has been known to cure Blindne&s;s and Deafne&s;s; but it is acknow|ledged, that it has much more frequent|ly di&s;appointed the Expectation. This affords no Argument for the Uncertainty of it's Effects, but rather the Contrary; for let it be but con&s;idered, that though the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Eyes and Ears are &s;ometimes attended with a Ten&s;ion, yet much the greate&s;t Part of them ari&s;e from Laxity.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<P>CONCERNING the Cure of Agues, I mu&s;t acknowledge my Opinion to be, at pre&s;ent, un&s;ettled for want of Experience. That &s;uch Cures have been effected by Electricity is affirmed by Writers of Cre|dit, and therefore is not to be que&s;tion|ed. But being thoroughly per&s;uaded, that Electricity operates directly contra|ry to &s;uch Medicines as are in general E&s;teem for the Cure of Agues, as the Peruvian Bark, and divers other A&s;trin|gents; I find it difficult to &s;uppo&s;e how it &s;hould be attended with Succe&s;s, unle&s;s Agues may be allowed to proceed from two very different Cau&s;es: and indeed the Body appears to be both a&s;tringed and relaxed, at different Periods in the &s;ame Intermittent. Perhaps then, the good Ef|fects of the Electricity might be owing to a fortunate Application of it in Point of Time; what that Point of Time may be, I cannot &s;ay, but if there be any Ground for the Conjecture, I &s;hould think it might be ea&s;ily determined by one who has the Advantage of frequent Practice. Mr. CAVALLO, in his Medical Electrici|ty, thinks it &s;hould be, <HI>a little before the Fit is expected,</HI> which may perhaps an|&s;wer the Expectation, by Removing the
<PB N="37" REF="38">Ten&s;ion before it begins to &s;hew it&s;elf. Perhaps al&s;o it may Sometimes &s;ucceed at the End of the Fit, when, notwith&s;tand|ing the apparent Relaxation of the Solids, there may be &s;ome &s;mall Remains of a Ten&s;ion, that may give Birth to another Fit.&mdash;Early in the Spring of 1781. ma|ny Per&s;ons in my Neighbourhood, were attacked with a Fever re&s;embling a Ter|tian; which was very ob&s;tinate, baffling, for a long Time, all the Endeavours of the Faculty. One of my Family being &s;eized with it, I embraced the Opportu|nity of trying Electricity; and at a Time when I thought the Fits were become pretty regular, pa&s;&s;ed two or three very &s;light Shocks, through the Sides and Sto|mach, tho&s;e being the Parts in which the Patient complained of a trouble&s;ome Pain. After this the Fit went off &s;o very light, that I was much plea&s;ed, and began to look on Electricity as a Specific for an Ague, con&s;equently did not fail to repeat it at the next Return; but how great was my Di&s;appointment, when I ob&s;erv|ed that Fit to be attended with Symp|toms more than ordinary &s;evere; I then de&s;i&s;ted for Fear of Mi&s;chief: For in|&s;tead of believing Electricity to be a Spe|cific
<PB N="38" REF="39">for an Ague, I now began to con|&s;ider it in the Light of certain boa&s;ted Medicines for the Gout, &s;erving only to avert the Paroxy&s;m for a While, which will be &s;ure to come at la&s;t, and make the greater Havock.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged however, that this was not a perfect Ague, for upon a more exact Ob&s;ervation, I could plainly di&s;cern, that, between the Paroxy&s;ms, the Fever did not entirely &s;ub&s;ide. But the Ca&s;e may be offered in Support of the Opinion before laid down, viz. That Elec|tricity does not &s;eem to be a good Remedy for Continual Fevers, and Di&s;orders where a morbid Cau&s;e is &s;uppo&s;ed to lie con|cealed: for unle&s;s it has a Power of ex|pelling the morbific Matter from the Blood, the Complaint mu&s;t remain; and I do not know, that Experience has &s;hewn it to have any &s;uch Power. It has in|deed been found to cau&s;e a very &s;udden Tran&s;lation of Pain, from a Limb or Joint, to the Stomach or Bowels, and back again: but &s;urely &s;uch &s;udden Tran&s;lations are not always to be effect|ed without Danger, e&s;pecially where there is a great Malignity of the Humours: and one fatal Accident might do infinite
<PB N="39" REF="40">Prejudice, both to the Profe&s;&s;or and his Art.</P>
<P>There have been many In&s;tances of A|gues cured by &s;uch Accidents as have cau&s;ed great Surpri&s;e; thus Electricity may &s;tand a good Chance to &s;ucceed; for it is certainly &s;urpri&s;ing enough, e|&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with it; but curing by Accident does not prove it fitted for any particular Purpo&s;e. Were it once e&s;tabli&s;hed in re|gular Practice, it would be a Benefit to Mankind; but while it is u&s;ed at Ran|dom, it cannot be deemed better than a <HI>Quack Medicine,</HI> the Effects of which, whether good or bad depend on Acci|dent.</P>
<P>If any Electrification were proper in Inflammatory Fevers, and others proceed|ing from a morbific Cau&s;e, it &s;eems to be the Simple, which is equally di&s;tri|buted throughout the whole Habit, and creates the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance. But as the mo&s;t gentle Electrification will quicken the Circulation, and increa&s;e Per&s;piration, whether Increa&s;e of Circulation can be of any Service at a Time when the Ve|locity of the Blood is already too great; or Promotion of Per&s;piration produce any
<PB N="40" REF="41">great Good, while the Blood and Hu|mours are too clammy and vi&s;cid, and robbed of their fluid Parts, mu&s;t with me remain a Que&s;tion till it be proved, that it is al&s;o a good Divider and Di&s;&s;olver of the Vi&s;cidities, and &s;uited to bring the Di&s;ea&s;e to a happy Cri&s;is; or to effect a Cure by expelling the latent Cau&s;e at once. Till this be proved, I mu&s;t re|peat it, I cannot place any Confidence in Electricity for the Cure of inflamma|tory Fevers; much le&s;s in putrid Fevers, where the Solids have already lo&s;t too much of their Cohe&s;ion.</P>
<P>In Fevers of the Nervous Kind there &s;eems to be as little Rea&s;on to expect Relief: neverthele&s;s it often happens that in Fevers merely nervous, the Nerves and Tendons are terribly affected with Ten&s;ions, Spa&s;ms, Contractions, &amp;c. there|fore (as I before hinted concerning ner|vous Ca&s;es in general) in that re&s;pect it may prove of wonderful Service; pro|vided it be u&s;ed no farther than to an|&s;wer the Intention of Removing &s;uch Spa&s;ms, &amp;c. and nothing more ought to be expected from it. In &s;uch Ca&s;es it frequently happens that the Patient ap|pears to receive &s;urpri&s;ing Relief at fir&s;t,
<PB N="41" REF="42">but on frequent Repetitions finds it di&s;a|gree with him. But for &s;uch Rigidities, Contractions, &amp;c. as frequently remain after &s;evere Fevers, Inflammations, Rheu|mati&s;ms, and &s;uch like, it is mo&s;t certain|ly an admirable Remedy; and very little Experience is &s;ufficient to prove it.</P>
<P>ELECTRICITY has been &s;aid to cure a Drop&s;y. &mdash; Without repeating what has been &s;aid, concerning Pal&s;ies, Agues, &amp;c. it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve&mdash;That large Draughts of cold Liquors taken by Per|&s;ons much heated with Exerci&s;e, are, by Phy&s;icians, enumerated among the prin|cipal Cau&s;es of a Drop&s;y: if then Elec|tricity be, as is here affirmed, an effica|cious Remedy in Ten&s;ions, &amp;c. it will follow, that where &s;uch a Cau&s;e has pre|ceded, while the Di&s;ea&s;e is recent, and before the Waters become vi&s;cid, it may prove one of the be&s;t Remedies that e|ver was introduced into Practice: becau&s;e as CAVALLO &s;ays in Med. Elect. Page 7, <Q>"It &s;eems to act even within tho&s;e Parts of the Body which, e&s;pecially when di&s;|ea&s;ed, are mo&s;tly out of the Reach of other Remedies."</Q> As on the Contrary, when the Di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es in a languid and
<PB N="42" REF="43">worn-out Con&s;titution, it will bid fair to ha&s;ten the Patient's Departure.</P>
<P>FROM what has been advanced it is ea&s;y to infer,</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> That the mo&s;t immediate Effect, to be expected from Electricity, admi|ni&s;tered in the medical Way, is, the Re|moval of Ten&s;ion, Rigidity, Spa&s;m, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>2ndly.</HI> That the be&s;t Chance for Suc|ce&s;s is, when the primary Cau&s;e is remov|ed. If a burning Coal be laid on the Hand, no Benefit is to be expected from Electricity untill the Coal be taken away, and then it will remove the &s;econdary Cau&s;e of the Pain, i. e. the Ten&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, in Ca&s;es where the primary Cau&s;e acts with le&s;s Rigour, it may, per|haps, be of Service in Relieving or Mi|tigating the Pain, at lea&s;t from Time to Time, untill the primary Cau&s;e &s;hall cea&s;e. Thus in &s;ome Fevers, the Convul&s;ions and Pain may probably be rendered tolerable while the Fever is running it's Cour&s;e; but this being Conjecture only, I &s;hall not dwell on it, but leave it to your Con|&s;ideration and Experience: only this I have to &s;ay, that in the imperfect Ague
<PB N="43" REF="44"> abovementioned, and a few other fever|i&s;h Ca&s;es that have fallen within my Ob|&s;ervations, it did not &s;eem to be attended with great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> That in Ca&s;es of Laxity it is ge|nerally pernicious, but under &s;ome Cir|cum&s;tances may (if managed with Pru|dence) be applied with great Advantage.</P>
<P>From whence it will follow, that Some|times it ought to be accompanied with &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tants, as &s;eem be&s;t adapted to promote the Intention, whether A&s;trin|gents, Corroborants, Di&s;cutients, Laxi|tives, Emollients, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiries I have been able to make, as well as from my own Ex|perience, it appears to me, that &s;imple Electrification, drawing or throwing the Stream, Sparks and Shocks of all Degrees, differ only in the Power and Strength of their Operation: they all <HI>relax and render pliable.</HI> And yet the milder Kinds may re|lieve a Malady, which the more powerful would increa&s;e. We know that mild A|&s;tringents, mild Purgatives, &amp;c. are fre|quently of the greate&s;t Service, at Times when &s;trong Ones would do great Mi&s;|chief: not becau&s;e they differ in Quality,
<PB N="44" REF="45">but becau&s;e the Patient's Con&s;titution can|not bear them all alike. The Peruvian Bark, given in &s;mall Do&s;es, often proves a &s;alutary Bracer to the Bowels; but if di&s;pen&s;ed in too large Quantities, has a contrary Effect. Thus, I pre&s;ume, it is with Electricity: &s;trong Shocks may, by over-acting their Part, increa&s;e a Pal&s;y they were intended to relieve. Suppo&s;e, for In&s;tance, a large Nerve leading to a Limb, from &s;ome injurious Cau&s;e, to be a&s;tringed, the Con&s;equence will be, that the Mu&s;cles of that Limb will become paralytic: if now that Nerve can by any Means be &s;o far relaxed, as to recover it's exact due Tone, the whole Limb will be re&s;tored to Health. But if the Nerve by a too powerful Application of the very &s;ame Means, be <HI>over relaxed,</HI> the Mu&s;cles will be &s;till paralytic in proportion to the Degree of that <HI>over Relaxation.</HI> Hence the Limb may be cured, or made wor&s;e, by a &s;kilful or un&s;kilful Application of the &s;ame Means: and thus an electric Stroke may either relieve a Pal&s;y, or in|crea&s;e it.</P>
<P>But although the milde&s;t Operations in Electricity may, many Times, be of the greate&s;t Service; yet I could wi&s;h every
<PB N="45" REF="46">Practitioner, in this infant State of the Science, to be very cautious, that he does not impute to the Mildne&s;s of his Ope|rations, the Credit of Cures towards which Electricity never afforded the &s;malle&s;t A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. This is of immen&s;e Importance to the Practice in general; for &s;o long as Men remain under Mi&s;takes, or Uncer|tainties, concerning the real Effects of Medicines, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to arrive at any regular Method of proceeding. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a Limb to be weakened from a Luxation, and to be free from Ten&s;ion, (this, I tru&s;t you will grant, is no wild Suppo&s;ition,) and that &s;trong Shocks are repeated to no Purpo&s;e, or rather to the Patient's Prejudice. Suppo&s;e al&s;o, that the O|perator, perceiving this &s;evere Treat|ment to be more injurious than u&s;eful, &s;hould omit the Shocks and have recour&s;e to Sparking, or drawing the Stream; this, though a perver&s;e Treatment likewi&s;e, may not be powerful enough to prevent the relaxed Fibres recovering their Tone, by their own ela&s;tic Power. Here kind Nature performs the Cure of a Malady that was begun by Misfortune, increa&s;ed by Mi&s;management, and at la&s;t is, by Mi&s;|take,
<PB N="46" REF="47">imputed to one particular Species of Electricity, which, in Truth, did not in the lea&s;t contribute towards it: and the U&s;e of Shocks is condemned, as general|ly if not univer&s;ally prejudicial, only be|cau&s;e they were injudiciou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P>Although I in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on Shocks, and the frequent Expediency of &s;trong Ones, I do not at pre&s;ent make u&s;e of a|ny thing more powerful than an Apothe|cary's Pint Vial, and that very &s;eldom full charged; by which you may judge that I am far enough from recommending de|&s;perate, or dangerous Experiments: Ex|perience has however demon&s;trated that, on proper Occa&s;ions, double, treble, and even four Times that Force may be ad|vi&s;ed with great Safety and advantage.</P>
<P>What Alteration Electricity may make in the Blood and Humours, I do not pre|tend to determine; that I never perceiv|ed any, I can with Truth declare. From the &s;urpri&s;ing Power it has of ha&s;tening the Fluids through the Orifices of the Ve&s;|&s;els, and con&s;equently of very much in|crea&s;ing Per&s;piration, it mu&s;t, I conjecture, leave the Blood &s;omewhat more dry than it was before the Operation; but I could never ob&s;erve, or indeed hear of any
<PB N="47" REF="48">Proof of it's attenuating Qualities. On the Solids it's Influence is unque&s;tio|nably very great: It is mo&s;t certainly a Relaxer and Remover of Rigidity, &amp;c. and frequently in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Man|ner. I am therefore thoroughly per&s;wad|ed, that if medical Philo&s;ophers had at|tended to this &s;ingle Circum&s;tance; it had, long before this Time, been brought into regular Practice: and many mi&s;erable Ob|jects might have received the Benefit of a Relief, which the whole Faculty, arm|ed with the mo&s;t powerful Medicines, were not able to afford.</P>
<P>How, or by what Means, the Removal of Ten&s;ions, &amp;c. is performed, I will not undertake to account. There is no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to &s;earch into, analyze, or explain the Nature of Electricity: perhaps it is more than the mo&s;t ingenious Man will e|ver be able to do. It is &s;ufficient for our Purpo&s;e, if Electricity be found to pro|duce <HI>certain regular Effects;</HI> and he who knows what tho&s;e Effects are, may apply it with as much Certainty and Succe&s;s, as if he under&s;tood the whole Theory of Effluvia and &s;ubtle Mediums; and could de&s;cant, in the mo&s;t learned Manner, on the Arcana of Nature: however from &s;e|veral
<PB N="48" REF="49">very common Experiments in Elec|tricity, it appears to act by a wonder|ful Kind of <HI>Inflation,</HI> which forces the Particles of Bodies, both &s;olid and fluid, either &s;uddenly or gradually, into, or to|wards a Separation. Hence you may ea|&s;ily gue&s;s the Rea&s;on why the Particles of all Fluids, and particularly the Globules of the Blood, are carried through Tubes and Ve&s;&s;els with an increa&s;ed Velocity. And perhaps Mr. CAVALLO, in his inge|nious E&s;&s;ay on Medical Electricity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 17.</NOTE> is ve|ry near the Point, where he &s;ays, <Q>"Ad|mitting Dr. FRANKLIN's Hypothe&s;is of Electricity; we &s;ee that it is not the Di|rection of the electric Fluid that de|termines the Fluids of the Body one Way or the other; but that the Effects u&s;ually ob&s;erved upon the Body when electrized, mu&s;t be owing to the Irrita|tion or DILATATION occa&s;ioned by the Action of that Fluid."</Q></P>
