<HEAD>Some rea&s;ons why the Contagion of the Small-Pox, received into the human body, cannot be extin|gui&s;hed or expelled by any Anti|dote, or other means than what Nature effects in producing the di&s;temper.</HEAD>
<P>THAT mo&s;t celebrated Pro|fe&s;&s;or, the learned <HI>Dr. Boer|haave,</HI> was of opinion that there is to be found out, in Nature, &s;uch a kind of medicine as would have the &s;pecific power of extingui&s;hing, or eradicating the Contagion of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> from a body infect|ed, without permitting any erup|tion of the pu&s;tules; in the man|ner that other poi&s;ons are cured by
<PB N="2" REF="7">peculiar <HI>Antidotes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aph. 1390-91-92. et prax. med. V. v.</NOTE>. Some other Phy&s;icians, al&s;o, revering the &s;en|timent of this great man, have pretended to &s;upport the &s;ame opi|nion.</P>
<P>But, as no improvements have yet appeared to have been made, at lea&s;t nothing material has been advanced, by the advocates for this enquiry, notwith&s;tanding the Doctor gave his rea&s;ons for his opi|nion, and explained his &s;ugge&s;tions as far as he could, it is probable, therefore, that the un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles which have ari&s;en from the con&s;ideration of this contagious venom, and the different manner of it's operations, have, hitherto, di&s;couraged all the attempts that may have been &s;ince made towards
<PB N="3" REF="8">the di&s;covery. And, indeed, I am inclined to think, that, had the Doctor written on this particular &s;ubject, after the practice of inocu|lation grew to be &s;o much u&s;ed in <HI>Europe,</HI> as it now is, he would, from the new di&s;covery of the operation of this morbific taint, have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons to an opi|nion, which, many years ago, he thought uncontrovertable. For &s;o con&s;picuous in experiment, as this is, could never have e&s;caped his &s;agacious ob&s;ervation; which proves that the lea&s;t particle of variolous pus, containing the very &s;eeds of contagion, by enflaming and cor|roding an external &s;olid part, pro|duceth <HI>a kind of Carbuncle;</HI> where|by the natural operation of this contagious infection is demon&s;trated to the greate&s;t degree of certainty,
<PB N="4" REF="9">and &s;ilences all <HI>hypothetical</HI> notions of its contaminating the fluids only, by explaining (as I &s;hall endeavour to do more hereafter) that the mor|bific effluvia of this di&s;ea&s;e received by in&s;piration, in the ordinary way of infection, by inflaming and cor|roding, in like manner, &s;uch in|ternal parts as are more immediate|ly &s;ub&s;ervient to the vital purpo&s;es, are therefore more likely to be pro|ductive of the mo&s;t dangerous con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>The method, however, <HI>given,</HI> for attaining to the knowledge of this di&s;covery, is, after the infection of the Small-pox is taken, to pre|vent inflammation, &s;o that a &s;uppu|rated matter may not en&s;ue: and this is propo&s;ed to be effected, by treating the di&s;temper, like other inflammatory ca&s;es, in the begin|ning;
<PB N="5" REF="10">and giving &s;uch correcting medicines, as, by gently diluting and di&s;&s;olving the blood, may car|ry off the cau&s;e by the convenient outlets; and &s;o cure the di&s;ea&s;e, while in it's fir&s;t &s;tate, without coming to &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the Doctor mentions a preparation of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Antimony,</HI> brought to a great degree of penetrability, and ren|dered intirely de&s;titute of all <HI>Acri|mony</HI> by di&s;&s;olution, &amp;c; from whence, he &s;ays, there ari&s;eth <HI>almo&s;t</HI> &s;uch a kind of medicine, and by which he hath &s;een &s;ome good ef|fects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aethiops Mineralis</HI> hath been likewi&s;e propo&s;ed as a &s;pecific medicine, for the &s;ame intention, by <HI>Dr. Lobb,</HI> who hath given &s;ome in&s;tances of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> being,
<PB N="6" REF="11">in his judgment, prevented by the timely u&s;e of it. But as there have been frequent examples of people e&s;caping this di&s;temper, who had been &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the greate&s;t danger of taking it; it is not improbable but that &s;ome of the&s;e may have been attributed, by mi&s;take, to &s;uch preventive means as had been u&s;ed on tho&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Cheyne</HI> al&s;o hath pronounc|ed that the be&s;t <HI>Antidote</HI> in nature again&s;t the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> and the <HI>Plague</HI> it&s;elf, is <HI>Aethiops Mineralis</HI> and <HI>Cinnabaris Antimonii,</HI> taken, made up into bolu&s;es, twice or three times a day, and wa&s;hed down with Orange Whey. Of the ef|ficacy of which, he &s;ays, he has had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful experience. For the confluent <HI>Small-pox,</HI> he
<PB N="7" REF="12">adds, is but a miniature of the <HI>Plague,</HI> and both are curable in good habits.</P>
<P>Many more writers (&s;ome of which are of great eminence) have touched al&s;o upon this matter, as the &s;entiment of <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> but without pre&s;uming any further; well knowing that an affair of this nature can admit of no alternative, and that it is to no manner of pur|po&s;e to pretend to defend by argu|ment what cannot be &s;ufficiently warranted by experience. For &s;uch particularities in opinion have been oftentimes ridiculed, in men of learning, as the effects of mere whim and chimera.</P>
<P>But the character of <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is too &s;acred for reflection, as he certainly had no de&s;ign to impo&s;e on the judgment of others by a
<PB N="8" REF="13">prediction of this &s;ort, which was grounded, probably, <HI>on &s;uch Spe|culations in Chemi&s;try</HI> as are not ea&s;ily to be explained on <HI>mecha|nical principles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr. Mead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De variolis et morbillis.</NOTE>, however, could not pa&s;s over this opinion of his learned friend without wondering how he could be induced to hope that &s;ome time or other a &s;pecific <HI>Antidote</HI> would be found again&s;t the contagious poi&s;on of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> that is, by which it would be &s;o tho|roughly de&s;troyed, that, tho'it had been received into the body, it could not produce the di&s;ea&s;e. For, continues he, the elements of things are &s;o certain, and &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed by the permanent laws of Nature; that who&s;oever would endeavour to change them, would
<PB N="9" REF="14">act like tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers <HI>by fire</HI> (as they &s;tile them&s;elves) who labour hard to tran&s;mute the ba&s;er metals into gold; and when continual di&s;appointments have convinced them of the vanity of their hopes, actually extract gold out of the pur&s;es of the ignorant and credu|lous by the fumes of their char|coal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stack's tran&s;l. p. 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In an affair of this kind, it is undoubtedly the &s;afe&s;t and true&s;t way to con&s;ult nature her&s;elf, as a <HI>divine</HI> principle, diffu&s;ed through|out the creation, acting in all bodies by certain properties which are pro|ductive of certain effects. And we may con&s;ider her in a va&s;t vari|ety of &s;en&s;es, as &s;he doth nothing in vain; attempts always to pre|&s;erve
<PB N="10" REF="15">her&s;elf; cures all di&s;ea&s;es; and acts upon unerring rules in all her ways. Hence we ob&s;erve in Fevers, particularly tho&s;e of the eruptive kinds, the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing commotions and conflicts, which &s;erve to throw off the morbific mat|ter by various ways, for the relief of the Patient; and, in the&s;e ca&s;es, e&s;pecially, &s;he is to be nicely ob&s;erved, and followed with the greate&s;t care; becau&s;e any counter|acting means would ob&s;truct her fir&s;t de&s;ign, and make her proceed upon other different principles, which would con&s;equently beattended with very different effects.</P>
<P>It ought to be con&s;idered, there|fore, whether a &s;pecific <HI>antidote</HI> again&s;t the contagious taint of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> (if &s;uch an one were di&s;|coverable) would not be likely
<PB N="11" REF="16">to do more hurt than good, by preventing a di&s;temper, which, perhaps, was intended by nature, as <HI>Dr. Gilchri&s;t</HI> ob&s;erves, for a drain to clear the con&s;titution of &s;ome gro&s;s humours, which, if not carried off in this way, would bring on other di&s;ea&s;es. The &s;ame Gen|tleman &s;upports this opinion by ob|&s;erving that tho&s;e Children who had had the Small-pox by inoculation in <HI>Scotland</HI> were uncommonly healthy; which he &s;uppo&s;es to be owing to this cau&s;e, that the Fever in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> communicated in the infant &s;tate, not only de&s;troys or expells the latent &s;eeds of di&s;|ea&s;es, before they are, by time and accidents, perfected, and put into action; but cau&s;es &s;uch an altera|tion of the humours as may make them le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of any morbid
<PB N="12" REF="17">impre&s;&s;ions: And the ve&s;&s;els being &s;o accu&s;tomed, before they become rigid, to certain motions and ex|ten&s;ions, the body is rendered, ever after, more pa&s;&s;ive to the impul|&s;es of any &s;ub&s;equent di&s;temper. This, he maintains, is agreeable to experience; for one who has &s;uffered an acute illne&s;s will bear &s;ickne&s;s better than another, who never had the like di&s;temper, and be le&s;s overcome by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edinb. E&s;&s;ays Phy&s;. and Liter. Vol. 2. Art. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> calls nature the great phy&s;ican; and our judicious <HI>Sy|denham</HI> &s;ays, that a di&s;ea&s;e is nothing more than an effort of nature to throw off the morbific matter for the health of the patient; which <HI>Dr. Mead</HI> has ob&s;erved to be no
<PB N="13" REF="18">where more particularly verified than in tho&s;e envenomed Fevers, in which the violence of the di&s;|temper breaks out on the Skin ei|ther in the form of <HI>pu&s;tules, car|buncles,</HI> or <HI>bubos.</HI> And hence it &s;eems pretty plain that no art can abrogate the law of nature, by the prevention of tho&s;e kind of di&s;|ea&s;es which happen from contagion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e corpu&s;cular effluvia of the Small-pox, or particles which fly off from di&s;tempered bodies, and, mixing with the juices of others, occa&s;ion the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, are pro|duced from a matter differing from all other poi&s;ons, and liable to cau&s;e inflammation in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, according to the con|&s;titutional &s;tate and condition of tho&s;e that receive them: and &s;ome mi&s;erable ca&s;es of the <HI>Small-pox</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="19">have &s;hewed us in&s;tances where the whole texture of the blood has been &s;o broken and di&s;&s;olved, that the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> after it had &s;tood a while to become cold, could but ju&s;t hold together. Yet, notwith|&s;tanding, there have been &s;ome in&s;tances where this poi&s;on hath given &s;o little di&s;turbance, as &s;carcely to introduce any perceiv|able lentor on the blood, at lea&s;t not enough to ob&s;truct it in the capil|lary Ve&s;&s;els: And we have &s;everal times remarked where it has been ap|plied by inoculation, that if it had not been for it's immediate action on a &s;olid part, it would have proved in&s;ufficient even to &s;how the cha|racteri&s;tick marks of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is not altogether improbable but that this contagious venom may operate by various
<PB N="15" REF="20">ways; &s;ometimes by coagulating the blood; at others by di&s;&s;olving it; and &s;ometimes by corroding the &s;olid parts them&s;elves: And this may be owing, perhaps, to &s;uch natural cau&s;es as are not with|in the reach of human penetration. Which con&s;iderations, notwith|&s;tanding the deference I pay to <HI>Dr. Boerhaave</HI>'s extraordinary merit and abilities, have induced me to que&s;|tion, even, the bare po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a di&s;covery. But, to go on.</P>
<P>The Doctor intimates that the bite of the <HI>Scorpion,</HI> which was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed to be certain death, is now cured by the appli|cation of the brui&s;ed <HI>Scorpion,</HI> or the oil of it, and concludes that all poi&s;ons have their <HI>antidotes;</HI> and, therefore, why may not a &s;pecific medicine be found out of &s;uch a
<PB N="16" REF="21">nature, that, being diffu&s;ed all the body over, after the variolous in|fection is received, may introduce contrary properties, and thereby extingui&s;h the di&s;temper in the be|ginning, before tho&s;e effects are produced which mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, nece&s;&s;arily follow? For what Phy|&s;ician, &s;ays he, in a <HI>Pleuri&s;y, Quin&s;y,</HI> &amp;c. would wait for a cure by &s;uppuration, when daily experi|ence convinces us that the&s;e di&s;tem|pers are regularly cured without it? and why may not the inflammation be carried off, as well, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> as in other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;o pre|vent its coming to &s;uppuration at all?</P>
<P>To this, it may be &s;aid, that the general method of cure in <HI>Pleu|ri&s;ies, Quin&s;ies,</HI> and other inflam|matory
<PB N="17" REF="22">di&s;tempers, which are nei|ther contagious, nor of the erup|tive kinds, proves in&s;ufficient to prevent the return of them, as often as the &s;udden changes and al|terations of the weather, different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and many other accidental cau&s;es may happen to produce them. But, it is not &s;o, in regard to the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> a di&s;ea&s;e which is propagated by it's own contagion only, without any other antecedent cau&s;e; and where a determinate length of time brings on every thing according to it's &s;tated periods; &s;o that nature, in doing her part, is a mo&s;t certain guide to the Phy&s;ician for the do|ing of his. Be&s;ides it is evident that the venom of this di&s;temper can infect us but once; in&s;omuch that that pabulum in our bodies,
<PB N="18" REF="23">which is productive of this di&s;ea&s;e, being totally taken up by the con|tagion it hath received, is thereby expunged and eradicated, &s;o that there remains nothing, afterwards, on which this morbific matter can have any further effect. And, indeed, in this &s;en&s;e, it may be truly &s;aid that the <HI>Small-pox</HI> is it's own <HI>antidote,</HI> by protecting all that undergo it from any future attack.</P>
<P>It may be granted how extream|ly difficult it is to clear the ma&s;s of blood of this poi&s;on; yet it is mo&s;t certainly true that Nature en|deavours, with all her might, at the expul&s;ion of it in the mo&s;t perfect manner; that is, by forcing the morbid matter, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the pu&s;tules<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mead de variol.</NOTE>: And
<PB N="19" REF="24">any interruption mu&s;t prove of dangerous con&s;equence, le&s;t the humours &s;hould be impeded in their circulatory motion, and fall into an inte&s;tine one, and grow putrid; which is frequently the ca&s;e after too large evacuations, or exce&s;&s;ive heat; where there is &s;uch a &s;carcity of &s;pirits, that the &s;olids do not vibrate &s;ufficiently to keep the fluids in their due velocity.</P>
<P>This plainly indicates the hurt|fulne&s;s of too great evacuations in the beginning of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and &s;hews the Phy&s;ician's part to be only to a&s;&s;i&s;t, by following nature; and not going before her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> are an inflamma|tory fever of the eruptive kind; who&s;e pu&s;tules never arrive to a purulent &s;tate like tho&s;e of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and they are cured by
<PB N="20" REF="25">bleeding, and cooling medicines: but, I believe, it was never yet &s;een that the&s;e remedies could pre|vent their eruption, tho' made u&s;e of ever &s;o &s;oon after taking in the nfection.</P>
<P>There have been &s;ome in&s;tances in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> where &s;pontane|ous hemorrhages, or other repeated bleedings have &s;eemed to alter the nature of the di&s;temper in &s;ome degree, by making that prove kind|ly, which would, probably, have fallen out otherwi&s;e, for want of tho&s;e evacuations; but, I am per|&s;uaded, there never was any one proof of the contagion being wholly carried off that way, without &s;ome eruption of the pu&s;tules: &s;o that it &s;eems evident, even to a demon|&s;tration, that Nature, after a re|moval of the load that oppre&s;&s;es
<PB N="21" REF="26">her, mu&s;t be left to do her part in her own way, by cau&s;ing &s;up|puration, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, as there happens to be oc|ca&s;ion for it; in order to free the body from the corrupted &s;tate of the blood and humours ari&s;ing from the contagious taint of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover it is certain that the whole animal body, at all times before it has pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> is, in every part alike, liable to receive the morbo&s;e, or infecting taint, and &s;o propagate the di&s;ea&s;e. We know, al&s;o, that the lea&s;t particle of the morbific mat|ter, applied to any part of the body, will cau&s;e the <HI>Small-pox</HI> to be produced as effectively as a much greater quantity could be capable of doing it. And it is evident, from common experience, that all
<PB N="22" REF="27">mankind, as well tho&s;e who come of parents that have had the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> as tho&s;e that have not, are alike liable to it; &s;o that we may conclude the pabulum of this di&s;|temper to be a part of the human nature, conceived in the fir&s;t rudi|ments of generation; and therefore not to be extingui&s;hed by any art, or other means, than it's own na|tural de&s;troyer, the <HI>Small-pox</HI> it&s;elf; which only can render the body more perfect, by eradicating this one natural principle of morta|lity, and thereby giving it a &s;ecu|rity, for ever, again&s;t any further attack from this great evil.</P>
<P>The contagion of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> previou&s;ly con&s;idered in a pe&s;tilen|tial &s;en&s;e, the true manner of it's operation on human bodies, as it may be be&s;t known from the expe|riment
<PB N="23" REF="28">of inoculation, &s;eems &s;uf|ficient to furni&s;h more matter for the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> than could po&s;&s;ibly have been advanced without it. In&s;omuch that the di&s;covery of a &s;pecific medicine to prevent the burning of a <HI>Cau&s;tic,</HI> or even <HI>Fire</HI> it&s;elf, may as well be expected, as to de&s;troy the power of variolous contagion, when taken either in the natural way, or appli|ed by inoculation. Mo&s;t certain, therefore, it is, that no di&s;covery of this kind, &s;o &s;eemingly repug|nant to the laws of Nature, can ever be a&s;cribed to human inven|tion.</P>

For her pro|gre&s;s is undoubtedly &s;lower or fa&s;|ter according to the different me|thods &s;he takes in expelling the morbific cau&s;e, &s;o that the morbid particles, being &s;eparated by her own action, may be di&s;charged in her own way.</P>
<P>When a body, therefore, be|comes contaminated by a contagious taint, it may be of the greate&s;t u&s;e to know by what means it &s;o hap|pened; as the mode of nature, in her method of extricating the morbific matter, differs, probably, in great mea&s;ure according to the different manner of receiving it: in&s;omuch that the danger or &s;afety of the patient may depend greatly on the primary communication of this matter either to an external or
<PB N="26" REF="31">an internal part. And this opi|nion hath been confirmed by many ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> pro|duced by inoculation, where the di&s;temper hath been remarkably great from a multitude of the pu&s;|tules, as well as the condition of them; which have gone off, by that preventive means, without any great unea&s;ine&s;s; whereas the &s;ame, in the natural way, are u&s;ually at|tended with a very <HI>high Fever, Delirium,</HI> and other dangerous contingencies, owing probably to imperceptible <HI>effluvia</HI> conveyed, at fir&s;t, to the <HI>Lungs, Heart, Brain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for a further explanation of this matter, by an enquiry into the different methods that nature pur|&s;ues in communicating the <HI>Small-pox</HI> both by common infection, and
<PB N="27" REF="32">the artificial experiment of inocu|lation, we &s;hall the better form a judgment, agreeable to her own elements and principles, by her own rules and indications. And, in order thereto, it is manife&s;tly certain, that, the air being infected with the venom of this di&s;temper, the morbific particles, contained therein, are received into the hu|man body by in&s;piration; and they act, wherever they happen to fall, by an irre&s;i&s;table power, like fire unextingui&s;hable, until they have utterly &s;ubdued that pabulum in the body which was &s;u&s;ceptible of this contaminating taint, and &s;o propagated the di&s;ea&s;e: for thus it is we are &s;ecured from having the <HI>Small-pox</HI> a &s;econd time. But the cau&s;es of it's de&s;tructive malignity may be more than the nice&s;t ob|&s;ervation
<PB N="28" REF="33">can di&s;cover. And, in|deed, the mode of Nature, from this theory alone, &s;eems to be too intricate and perplexing for human under&s;tanding; in&s;omuch that the nature of the morbific matter, from whatever different kind of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> it may happen to come, is cer|tainly the &s;ame, and plainly makes no difference in the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. The difference of con&s;ti|tutions, therefore, it may rea&s;on|ably be &s;uppo&s;ed, is the principal cau&s;e of the different kinds of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> And, the&s;e principles being generally admitted, I think it evident, therefore, as far as it can be demon&s;trated from experience, that a different manner in giving the infection (I mean that of ino|culation) manife&s;tly produceth a different effect. And this, I make
<PB N="29" REF="34">not the lea&s;t doubt, would unex|ceptionably appear upon the trial, if it was po&s;&s;ible to meet with two per&s;ons of exactly the &s;ame age and con&s;titution, by communicating, to each of them, the &s;ame conta|gious taint, by the different ways of infection. But, for want of this, let us examine further, by pur&s;uing the mode of nature, al&s;o, under the experiment of inocula|tion, and &s;ee what new di&s;covery will ari&s;e to give an additional light to this matter.</P>
<P>By this method of trial it is evi|dent that the &s;malle&s;t portion of the variolous pus, applied, by a &s;light inci&s;ion, to any part of the body, acts in the manner of a <HI>cau&s;tic,</HI> by inflaming and corroding the part; in&s;omuch that the conti|nuity, after &s;ome days, is de&s;troy|ed;
<PB N="30" REF="35">and an ulceration cau&s;ed from the &s;eparation of the <HI>e&s;char:</HI> And the taint of this infection, being infu&s;ed into the blood, is convey|ed, by means of the circulation, throughout the whole animal body; and touching every where on it's proper pabulum, like a &s;park of fire among particles of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> or <HI>Nitre,</HI> in a certain length of time it doth it's office, by exciting feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, which regularly go off in a <HI>diaphore&s;is;</HI> whereby the &s;alt &s;erum of the blood, &s;o impregnated, is driven out by the glands of the &s;kin; and then the pores, being properly enlarged, let out the fiery pu&s;tules on the &s;urface; which &s;eems to be the true manner of the propagation and eruption of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI></P>
<PB N="31" REF="36">
<P>From this experiment we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the morbi|fic effluvia of this di&s;temper, re|ceived by in&s;piration al&s;o, produce the &s;ame kind of <HI>phenomenon</HI> in the natural way; and that the&s;e veno|mous particles, happening to fall on the vital parts, by inflaming and corroding the &s;ame, in like man|ner, are &s;o commonly attended with their fatal effects; for in&s;tance, on the <HI>Lungs, Brain,</HI> &amp;c.; where it is impo&s;&s;ible for nature to help her|&s;elf, or be furni&s;hed with any a&s;&s;i&s;|tance to her relief. And this may occa&s;ion, which we daily &s;ee, <HI>high fevers, delirium, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;truggles and conflicts, and &s;udden changes in the Small-pox.</HI></P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, al&s;o, that an infinite number of the viro&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="37">particles, contained in the infected air, may be drawn in by the breath and no&s;trils at the &s;ame time; and &s;o conveyed by the divarication of the <HI>Trachaea</HI> to the <HI>Lungs;</HI> and al&s;o by the <HI>olfactory nerves,</HI> or their <HI>fibrillae,</HI> to the mo&s;t delicate texture of the brain, whereby a multitude of different parts may receive the contagious effect at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time; which, by pervading the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the whole animal <HI>compages,</HI> may &s;o break and de&s;troy the continuity of parts of moment, as to render a di&s;&s;olution of the whole frame un|avoidable. And that particular &s;pe|cies of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> in which the texture of the blood is &s;o ab&s;olutely broken, that it di&s;chargeth it&s;elf by every outlet of the body; and, &s;tagnating in the &s;mall cuticular
<PB N="33" REF="38">ve&s;&s;els, produceth black, gangren|ous &s;pots, all the &s;urface over, is but too melancholy a proof of the truth of this <HI>hypothe&s;is,</HI> from the &s;udden and untimely de&s;truction that it u&s;ually brings upon the patient.</P>
<P>Inoculation explains al&s;o the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of this opinion: for if the morbific matter be applied to ever &s;o many place, it will have the &s;ame effect in every one; by occa&s;ioning &s;o many corroding <HI>Car|buncles,</HI> if they may be &s;o called; which, the more they are, the more likely they will be to increa&s;e the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the contagious infection of the blood and &s;pirits: and, for this rea&s;on, I have wholly given up an opinion I had e&s;pou&s;ed &s;ome years ago; from a &s;uppo&s;ition that di&s;charges from more inoculated places than one would be of advan|tage
<PB N="34" REF="39">to the patient, by carrying off a greater quantity of the humours of the body, by means of tho&s;e drains; and &s;o, con&s;equently, would be likely to prevent &s;uch feveri&s;h di&s;orders and complaints, as might, otherwi&s;e, ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> But experience hath plainly &s;hown this kind of doctrine to be erroneous; and convinced me, that the application of the vi|ro&s;e matter, to one part only, is much &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t; and, indeed, the corro&s;ion of any one part, cau&s;ed by the application of variolous mat|ter, is a &s;ufficient proof of its tak|ing effect, and doing all that this contagion can do; even tho' there may happen to be &s;carce any febril &s;ymptoms produced from it, or &s;o much as a perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hed pu&s;tule of the <HI>Small-pox:</HI> for the
<PB N="35" REF="40">ulcerated part being cicatri&s;ed, will remain, beyond all di&s;pute, as cer|tain a mark of &s;ecurity to the pa|tient, as if the &s;kin had received the impre&s;&s;ions of having under|gone this di&s;temper in ever &s;o great a degree. And truly, if it were not &s;o, &s;everal per&s;ons, under my own care, who had no pu&s;tulary erup|tions, mu&s;t have taken the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> from tho&s;e who were their companions and bed-fellows in the di&s;temper, by the ordinary way of infection; which the experience of &s;uch trials plainly convinced me they could not. From the&s;e ca&s;es, therefore, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that this kind of artificial car|buncle, cau&s;ed by the inoculation, was alone capable of extricating from the human nature the fir&s;t princi|ples of this di&s;temper.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="41">
<P>From what hath been already advanced, it &s;eems pretty certain that the&s;e fir&s;t principles of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> being &s;u&s;ceptible of the contagion to the mo&s;t di&s;tant extre|mities, are diffu&s;ed, in all parts alike, throughout the whole ani|mal body; the principal caution, therefore, requi&s;ite to be ob&s;erved by Phy&s;icians, in regard to tho&s;e in whom this matter is to be ap|plied, is to con&s;ider well their dif|ferent con&s;titutions and tempera|ments, as they are of them&s;elves naturally productive of the diffe|rent kinds of the <HI>Small-pox.</HI> For it is, I believe, a generally receiv|ed opinion that the contagious ve|nom of this di&s;ea&s;e is in it's own nature the &s;ame, and differs only according to the different bodies it is infu&s;ed into. In &s;ome, for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="37" REF="42">we &s;ee that this poi&s;on ap|plied can produce no more than it's own <HI>variolous carbuncle,</HI> or a very few of the pu&s;tules at mo&s;t, and tho&s;e of the &s;horte&s;t duration; whereas, in others, it is manife&s;t that the different fluids become more contaminated, and, therefore, con&s;equently produce other diffe|rent degrees of the <HI>Small-pox:</HI> and wherever the <HI>lymphatick ve&s;&s;els</HI> are corroded by the <HI>variolated acri|mony,</HI> being more than can be tran&s;pired by the pores of the &s;kin, it occa&s;ions a &s;uffu&s;ion of the <HI>lym|pha</HI> it&s;elf, and &s;o con&s;equently pro|duceth a confluence of the <HI>Small-pox;</HI> and this happening common|ly in a greater degree on the head and face, is undoubtedly owing to the great force of the circulation of the blood, which, carrying
<PB N="38" REF="43">with it a variolated power, cau&s;es the effects above mentioned. The ventricles of the brain al&s;o, from the &s;ame morbo&s;e cau&s;e, are u&s;u|ally &s;o affected as to occa&s;ion deli|rium, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> in the &s;ame manner probably, that the effluvia of &s;trong drink and &s;pirits affect the brain in drunkenne&s;s: for thus it is that the blood, having received any morbi|fic taint, purifies it&s;elf in the cir|culation, by throwing off it's he|terogeneous particles by the com|mon emunctories which nature hath provided, as far as the animal faculties, under a morbid &s;tate are capable of accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e principles in our nature, which are &s;u&s;ceptible of the conta|gion of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> tho' they are not, I believe, as I have before ob|&s;erved, liable to undergo a change,
<PB N="39" REF="44">by any power of medicine, &s;uffici|ent to prevent the influence of va|riolous infection; yet experience convinceth us (if we can be &s;o con|vinced) that the manner of propa|gating the di&s;temper produceth a very different effect: and there can be no occa&s;ion to enforce the truth of this opinion by argument, &s;ince God's Providence hath appeared, in the &s;ucce&s;s of inoculation, &s;o much in favour of that practice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since inoculation hath been brought into practice, it is &s;aid, by good authority, that there has been an annual decrea&s;e of a fifth part of the deaths by the <HI>Small-pox</HI> within the bills of mortality.</NOTE>.</P>
