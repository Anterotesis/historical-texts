<P>_OUR Univer&s;ity Method of &s;tudy|ing <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> is attended with &s;o many Di&s;couragements, it is &s;uch an expen&s;ive, tedious, difficult way to Science, that one who has any talent at <HI>Projecting</HI> cannot, I think, em|ploy it more humanely than in putting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Youth</HI> upon a &s;horter and ea&s;ier
<PB N="10" REF="4">road. The Pride and Ill-nature, perhaps the Avarice too, of the Learned in every Science, would gladly make a my&s;tery of the art they profe&s;s, and render it inacce&s;&s;ible but to a few. Ask a Gentleman of the <HI>Ae&s;culapian</HI> tribe, what cour&s;e of Education is requi&s;ite to the making of a <HI>Phy&s;ician?</HI> He will pre&s;ently tell you, that a young Man who would &s;uc|ce&s;sfully apply him&s;elf to the Study of <HI>Me|dicine,</HI> mu&s;t fir&s;t of all have an Under&s;tand|ing capable of In&s;truction; and that after he is pretty far advanced in the Languages and &s;uch other pieces of Learning as he imagines to be nece&s;&s;arily previous and introductory to Phy&s;ick, he mu&s;t &s;tudy every particular Branch of that Science under able Teachers, and labour night and day for God knows how many years, before he can be &s;uppo&s;ed fit to Practi&s;e. Very mode&s;t Demands truly! This is either the mo&s;t malicious fetch or the &s;imple&s;t mi&s;take in the world: for in reality, Learning is no more nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> than to a <HI>Fidler.</HI> And for all this pother, I am mi&s;taken too if I cannot lay down a Method, by the religious and &s;trict ob&s;ervance of which, a young man (what|ever his natural Sen&s;e be) may, in two
<PB N="11" REF="5">or three years time, without any expence either of Money or <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> worth calculating, drop into the world not only a ripe <HI>Surgeon</HI> or <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> but <HI>Phy&s;ician, Surgeon</HI> and <HI>Apothecary</HI> all in one. But be|fore I proceed to communicate my <HI>Scheme,</HI> I here &s;olemnly declare that I have not the lea&s;t pique at the pre&s;ent <HI>Faculty of Phy|&s;icians,</HI> nay, that I honour that learned So|ciety; but <HI>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, magis amica veritas.</HI> It were a piece of complai&s;ance, unworthy a truly generous and exten&s;ively-benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, to con|ceal &s;uch means as mu&s;t evidently make the acqui&s;ition of an u&s;eful <HI>Art</HI> much ea&s;ier, merely for the &s;ake of indulging the narrow humour of it's pre&s;ent <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> who grudge that any &s;hould ri&s;e to the <HI>Dignities</HI> and <HI>Pri|vileges</HI> of their <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion</HI> with le&s;s Pain and Charge than them&s;elves have done.</P>
<P>Well then, to begin with the <HI>previous</HI> Qualifications of our Student. He mu&s;t be provided by bountiful <HI>Nature,</HI> with an in|exhau&s;tible fund of <HI>A&s;&s;urance,</HI> that <HI>cardinal Virtue,</HI> which without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other is &s;ufficient to make a great man. A
<PB N="12" REF="6">little <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> would not be ami&s;s; but as this is &s;eldom an Ingredient in a Con&s;titution where the other predominates, and as it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hall not reckon upon it. <HI>Impudence</HI> alone will do, for it gives &s;uch a <HI>force</HI> to the otherways <HI>lighte&s;t</HI> Merit, that the Addre&s;s, or rather the A&s;&s;ault, of a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it to any eminent de|gree, is not to be re&s;i&s;ted. If be&s;ides he can make a &s;hift to read <HI>Corderius</HI> with the help of a Dictionary, that is to &s;ay, if he has a <HI>Quantum &s;ufficit</HI> of <HI>Latin</HI> to enable him to under&s;tand a <HI>Recipe</HI> and to accent a <HI>hard word</HI> gracefully, he is now fitted to attempt the mo&s;t arduous parts of the <HI>Study.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon therefore as our young man is thus hopefully qualified, let him forthwith be bound Apprentice for two or three years to an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who <HI>pre&s;ides</HI> like a <HI>whole|&s;ome Planet</HI> over &s;ome Country-Town, &s;hed|ding kindly Influence for &s;everal miles round him. His main bu&s;ine&s;s during the time of his Apprentice&s;hip will be, to &s;pread now and then a <HI>Plai&s;ter,</HI> &s;ometimes to make up an <HI>Electuary</HI> or a <HI>Ma&s;s of Pills,</HI> to admini&s;ter <HI>Cly&s;ters</HI> in great abundance, and to manage
<PB N="13" REF="7">the <HI>Non-naturals</HI> of the gaunt hide-bound Steed upon who&s;e back his Ma&s;ter ranges the Country, like the <HI>King of Terrours</HI> on his <HI>pale Hor&s;e.</HI> Tho' this la&s;t may not appear to be a very liberal Office, yet as far as it will give him an occa&s;ion to become acquain|ted with the Con&s;titution of that generous Animal, and with the general <HI>Regimen</HI> that &s;uits it be&s;t, he will find it of mighty ad|vantage to him afterwards, when he comes to exerci&s;e the <HI>Hippohiatrical</HI> Function, the cultivation of which makes a very con&s;idera|ble Article in the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Medicine,</HI> in &s;ome parts of the Country. When he is at lei&s;ure from the&s;e more important <HI>Duties,</HI> he may, if he plea&s;es, glance over &s;ome &s;hort general Sy&s;tem of <HI>Anatomy.</HI> I mu&s;t own in|deed this is almo&s;t a needle&s;s trouble, yet I would have him able to tell upon occa&s;ion whether the <HI>Stomach</HI> lies in the <HI>Abdomen</HI> or in the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and the like, if it were only for ornament's &s;ake, and to keep him in coun|tenance among tho&s;e people who have got a notion that &s;ome acquaintance with the &s;truc|ture of the Human Body is nece&s;&s;ary to a <HI>Phy&s;ician;</HI> for we mu&s;t not hope to reform the world all at once. When he has thus
<PB N="14" REF="8">laid a good Foundation in <HI>Anatomy,</HI> to which I allow him a month, or, if his Ma&s;ter rides much and the roads are dirty, &s;ix weeks, let him proceed to the <HI>Practice of Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Surgery:</HI> A &s;hort Sy&s;tem for each will be &s;ufficient. He will frequently have occa&s;ion to practi&s;e <HI>Chemie</HI> under his Ma&s;ter's eye, and thus may gain a competent skill in this Branch of the Study without the fatigue of Reading. A <HI>Botani&s;t</HI> he mu&s;t grow, whether he will or not. And as for the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> and <HI>Methodus prae&s;cribendi,</HI> he may make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the&s;e in this manner. As often as a Phy&s;ician's Bill comes to his Ma&s;ter's Shop, let him out with his Pocket-book, <HI>&s;lap it down and make it his own,</HI> according to Mr. <HI>Bayes</HI>'s <HI>Rule of Records.</HI> As he mu&s;t have frequent acce&s;s to know, again&s;t what Di&s;ea&s;e this or that Pre&s;cription was de&s;ign'd, let him there|fore devote a page or &s;o in his Pocket-com|panion to every Di&s;ea&s;e, and under each of the&s;e let him range the Pre&s;criptions adapted thereto. Thus when he engages in the <HI>Practice</HI> him&s;elf, whatever Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hall fall in his way, he has no more to do but turn over his <HI>Vade mecum,</HI> where he will probably find &s;omething proper for it. With regard
<PB N="15" REF="9">to the different <HI>Stages</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es, the various <HI>Combinations of Symptoms,</HI> and the like, the&s;e are <HI>&s;ubtile trifles</HI> that none but your <HI>whim&s;ical people</HI> give them&s;elves any trou|ble about. In the mean time, &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Receipts</HI> as he has not got &s;ufficient intelligence to warrant his reducing under the Article of any Di&s;ea&s;e, will &s;erve him in good &s;tead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>A|nomalous Ca&s;es,</HI> which in all probability will frequently occur to him. If by &s;ollowing this cour&s;e, he is not furni&s;hed with a com|pleat Sy&s;tem of <HI>Recipes</HI> by the time that his Apprentice&s;hip is expired, let him con&s;ult <HI>Markham's Engli&s;h Hou&s;ewife's skill in Phy|&s;ick,</HI> to be found in the <HI>Quarto</HI> Edition of his Works, where he will meet with <HI>Receipts</HI> that will either <HI>help</HI> or prove a <HI>&s;overeign Cure</HI> in every Di&s;ea&s;e. I have known very valu|able Collections of this kind in the hands of &s;ome Ladies.</P>
<P>Behold! what a bare &s;imple thing is <HI>Phy|&s;ick!</HI> when it's &s;howy Luxuriances, it's fruit|le&s;s Branches, are lopped off. Vain &s;welling Science, how much art thou &s;hrunk! How is the Learning of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and the <HI>We&s;tern Schools,</HI> how are the toils of the ancient <HI>Sages</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="10"><HI>Tho&s;e</HI> of modern days, &s;wallowed up almo&s;t at once by a <HI>Boy!</HI> and a <HI>Boy</HI> of no great <HI>depth</HI> neither! For now is the <HI>grand Affair</HI> fini&s;hed, and our <HI>Scholar</HI> is perfectly well in&s;tructed in every part of his <HI>Study.</HI> I &s;hall appeal to him&s;elf if he is not. If a young man, ble&s;&s;ed with the&s;e natural Gifts I have demanded, after &s;uch a happy Education, is not con&s;ci|ous of greater Abilities than almo&s;t any of tho&s;e you call <HI>regular Phy&s;icians,</HI> I am much mi&s;taken. This very Shew of Merit, tho' he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nothing at all of the Sub&s;tance, will recommend him prodigiou&s;ly to the Vul|gar, <HI>Great and Small,</HI> (that is to &s;ay, to nine|teen at lea&s;t of twenty parts of Mankind) who are &s;uch humane Judges of a man's qua|lifications, that they never &s;eek further than his own word for them, but always mea&s;ure his Abilities by his Preten&s;ions. Now I &s;ay our young <HI>Doctor</HI> may go where he plea&s;es. He cannot fail to be by this time a skilful <HI>Apothecary,</HI> and for <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Surgery,</HI> it is &s;trange if he is not equally qualified for Practi&s;ing either <HI>ubi&abque; gentium.</HI> Or if he finds his Genius more particularly turned to one Di&s;ea&s;e than to the re&s;t, he may with con|&s;iderable emolument both to him&s;elf and the
<PB N="17" REF="11">Public, confine his Practice to that, and may make a good figure as an <HI>Antidy&s;enteric</HI> or <HI>Antimaniac Phy&s;ician,</HI> as a <HI>Vermicide,</HI> a <HI>Tooth-drawer,</HI> or a <HI>Corn-cutter.</HI> And if he applies him&s;elf to the <HI>Ob&s;tetrical</HI> Art, let him turn over <HI>Culpepper</HI>'s <HI>Midwife enlarg'd</HI> night and day. That little Book is worth a whole Library. All that is po&s;&s;ible to be known in that Art is there trea&s;ur'd up in a &s;mall <HI>Duodecimo.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed, yea for ever ble&s;&s;ed, be the memory of the inimitable Authour, who, and who alone, had the <HI>curious happine&s;s</HI> to mix the profound Learning of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> with the facetious Humour of <HI>Plautus!</HI></P>
<P>And now, that I may not omit any thing that lies in my power towards the preparing of our <HI>Doctor</HI> for bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;hall offer him a few Advices for the regulation of his Con|duct, when he comes abroad into the World. As &s;oon therefore as he is thus exqui&s;itely accompli&s;hed, he mu&s;t think of Tran&s;plant|ing him&s;elf to &s;ome Place where he is little known. And whether he commence <HI>iti|nerant</HI> or <HI>fixed Phy&s;ician</HI> (tho' I would ra|ther he chu&s;ed the latter Situation, as more agreeable to the Dignity of his Profe&s;&s;ion)
<PB N="18" REF="12">I advi&s;e him fir&s;t to make him&s;elf a little ac|quainted with <HI>Geography,</HI> that he may not be at a lo&s;s to relate what <HI>Wonders</HI> he has &s;een in <HI>foreign Countries.</HI> This will have a mighty Charm with the Vulgar, who have a &s;hrewd notion of things which one would think above their reach, and know perfectly well what an amazing Influence the <HI>foreign Air</HI> has upon a man's Intellectuals. How this <HI>foreign Air</HI> operates, is not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to enquire; only it is undeniable that it has a prodigious effect. It is not only the mo&s;t effectual, but the ea&s;ie&s;t way to Im|provement; &s;ince in this ca&s;e a man has no need to exert him&s;elf any further, than ju&s;t to conde&s;cend in his own mind upon any Art or Science that he would de&s;ire to be ma&s;|ter of, and he mu&s;t imbibe it or cea&s;e to Breathe. He is a <HI>Spunge</HI> thrown into water. For take me a man that has &s;carce &s;en&s;e e|nough to &s;pell his own name, and Steep him for two or three years in a <HI>foreign</HI> Atmo|&s;phere, you will bring him out again Wring|ing-full of Knowledge, tho' he had done nothing con&s;iderable all the time but drank pure <HI>quinte&s;&s;ential Rum</HI> or a little <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> with water by way of <HI>Punch</HI> in a <HI>Guinea|&s;hip,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="13">or &s;trolled about arrayed in Sheep's guts with the ingenious Inhabitants of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> Nay, &s;uppo&s;e he had pa&s;&s;ed all the time of his foreign Sojourn in a profound Sleep, he &s;hould find him&s;elf &s;trongly Im|pregnated with Science when he awaked. The meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant of the vul|gar know this; And it is convenient to hu|mour them. For it is really no cheat at bottom, if one who has received all the Eru|dition which far-di&s;tant Regions can com|municate, without &s;tirring a foot from home, if &s;uch a one, I &s;ay, &s;hould take the benefit of being reputed a <HI>travelled Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>But I had almo&s;t forgot to enjoin a very nece&s;&s;ary Branch of Education. Nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome ca&s;es, tho' indeed to an ordinary Judge it may appear &s;omewhat trifling. What I have in view at pre&s;ent is the art of <HI>Fumi&s;uc|tion</HI> and of Drinking &s;trong Liquor valiantly. I would have him apply indefatigably to the&s;e in the time of his Apprentice&s;hip, his more important Studies need not cool for it neither: And he mu&s;t have a very &s;low ca|pacity, if after two or three years diligent application, he is not as able a Practitioner
<PB N="20" REF="14">both ways as the mo&s;t <HI>Phlegmatic Ju&s;tice</HI> in a whole County. He will find the Advantage of the&s;e Qualifications, if his Lot is ordered him in any part of the Country where the exerci&s;e of &s;uch elegant Arts is the reigning Diver&s;ion or Bu&s;ine&s;s. For they will almo&s;t infallibly recommend him to the Patronage of &s;ome jocular <HI>Squire,</HI> who every Evening, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his never-flinching friend, the <HI>&s;pi|ritual Doctor,</HI> wraps him&s;elf up in a thick night of Tobacco-&s;moak, and murders an artificial Thir&s;t with repeated Draughts of <HI>&s;trong-Beer.</HI> If, added to this, he be a <HI>good Shot,</HI> and can roar at a Fox-cha&s;e, his For|tune is made in &s;pight of hazard.</P>
<P>Now as &s;oon as our <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> begins to lay him&s;elf out for Bu&s;ine&s;s, let him a&s;&s;ault the <HI>general Ear</HI> with long and loud Relations of the mighty Exploits he has performed. <HI>Exempli gratia:</HI> Every Brook will furni&s;h him with Pebbles, rugged, brown, and large enough, which, after his <HI>Brethren</HI> the <HI>other Phy&s;icians</HI> had condemned his Patient to un|dergo the operation of <HI>Lithotomy,</HI> he made him di&s;charge by the &s;ole virtue of <HI>Diureticks.</HI> In this ca&s;e, the larger that he picks his
<PB N="21" REF="15">&s;tones the better, only he mu&s;t take care that they are no larger than the human Blad|der may be &s;uppo&s;ed able to contain; if he keeps him&s;elf within the&s;e bounds he cannot overdo things, for the greater the wonder be, it is &s;o much the more taking. Let him talk confidently of &s;uch feats, no matter whether they are po&s;&s;ible or not; for tho' <HI>Miracles,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>are cea&s;ed, the Bea&s;t with many heads</HI> can &s;wallow them with as much alacrity as ever. <HI>It</HI> likes hugely too to be re|galed with hard words; the&s;e work like a Spell upon the ignorant Hearers, and are the &s;ure &s;ign of a <HI>great Scholard.</HI> Therefore for the inrichment of his Phra&s;eology and the edifi|cation of the gaping Herd, I coun&s;el him, in&s;tead of turning over a Dictionary, which is but an awkard, trouble&s;ome, way of learn|ing the <HI>Terms of Art,</HI> to get by heart the <HI>La|tine Index</HI> to any Sy&s;tem of <HI>Botany,</HI> where he may have as many odd-&s;ounding words at one view, as may, when judiciou&s;ly mix'd, &s;ufficiently darken his Expre&s;&s;ion, and give his di&s;cour&s;e the air of an <HI>Oracle.</HI></P>
<P>Now mu&s;t he, like the Carrion-crow, &s;mell out his <HI>Prey,</HI> and wherever the Di&s;|ea&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="16">are, there let him be. When a Phy|&s;ician's Pre&s;cription comes to his &s;hop, I ad|vi&s;e him without delay to make a vi&s;it to the Patient, and to let him know that he did not think it proper to make up the Medi|cines which were ordered till he knew his Condition him&s;elf. Then after he has felt his Pul&s;e, viewed his Water, and asked him a few Que&s;tions, he may proceed in this manner&mdash;<Q>"It is very lucky for you, <HI>Sir,</HI> that I happened to u&s;e this Caution, for the <HI>Recipe</HI> that came to my hand is quite wide of the purpo&s;e; &s;o we &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, let it alone, and I'll &s;end you &s;ome|thing that will in a little time do you &s;er|vice."</Q>&mdash;This cannot fail to &s;ucceed to his wi&s;h among the <HI>Million.</HI> But where the Patient is &s;o ob&s;tinate and intractable, that all he can utter to his own prai&s;e or the di&s;ad|vantage of the Phy&s;ician is not &s;ufficient to &s;hake him, he may have his full Revenge both upon the Phy&s;ician and Patient through the grace of <HI>Pharmacy.</HI>&mdash;Thus I have de|livered the principal <HI>Rules</HI> by which our <HI>Doctor</HI> mu&s;t direct his Conduct; the re&s;t I leave to his own Di&s;cretion.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="17">
<P>Since I wrote this, I am informed by &s;e|veral hands, that the Method I have laid down is generally in every point, and has been for &s;ome ages, practi&s;ed thro' <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> of this kind are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Quacks.</HI> However, I conceive it may not be unaccep|table to the&s;e Gentlemen to pre&s;ent them with a regular Draught of their own Scheme, and it may at the &s;ame time be of &s;ervice to Beginners to give them a view of their <HI>Agenda</HI> at once. In the mean time I am glad, that tho' I am di&s;appointed of the honour of be|ing the fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;coverer</HI> of this way, I am for that very rea&s;on &s;afe from engaging in a Quarrel with the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> which I had almo&s;t laid my account with. And more|over, one of my Friends tells me, that the more <HI>Quacks,</HI> as he calls them, the better for the Phy&s;icians. <Q>"For, &s;ays he, the <HI>Wrath of Heaven</HI> and the <HI>proper Vices</HI> of Mankind, are &s;carce &s;o productive of Di&s;|ea&s;es as are the&s;e <HI>Quacks;</HI> who in places where they abound, and where the Inha|bitants for every aching head or &s;cratch of a pin, have recour&s;e to their <HI>skill,</HI> keep
<PB N="24" REF="18">up a perpetual <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> the whole year round."</Q> But this I take to be meer Raillery.</P>
<P>Another Friend of mine, who is al&s;o a <HI>Projector,</HI> and confiders things &s;eriou&s;ly, has a Scheme by him for the more advantageous regulation of the <HI>Civil Puni&s;hments.</HI> Among other things he propo&s;es, that all <HI>Doc|tors</HI> of this kind, whether <HI>Officinal</HI> or <HI>Er|rant,</HI> &s;hould be taken up and di&s;tributed among the publick Goals, to &s;uperintend the Health of Capital Offenders: (for he di&s;ap|proves of <HI>publick Executions.</HI>) And that &s;uch of the&s;e Delinquents as e&s;cape with life and limb after a year's Di&s;cipline under their re|&s;pective Phy&s;icians, &s;hould be taken into the Army; <Q>"for, &s;ays he, they'll probably make hardy Soldiers."</Q> He thinks further, that for the &s;upport of the&s;e <HI>private Officers,</HI> be|&s;ides the di&s;carded Hangman's Fees, the Country &s;hould not grudge a &s;mall Tax up|on every <HI>Life,</HI> (at lea&s;t upon the <HI>Lives</HI> of tho&s;e who u&s;ed to employ them before the commencement of their new <HI>Dignity</HI>) e&s;pe|cially &s;ince by this means they are &s;ecured
<PB N="25" REF="19">from the mo&s;t mortal dangers they were expo&s;ed to.</P>
<P>But for all this, I &s;hall not lo&s;e conceit of my Scheme till I have better rea&s;on. For I have &s;ome cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that the Gentlemen who talk &s;o unfavourably of the&s;e Sons of <HI>Poean,</HI> are not altogether free of Prejudice.</P>

<P>_WEll <HI>Mercury,</HI> now that we are arrived at <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Pa|lace, pray tell me what's my Bu&s;ine&s;s here? You came to me with a di&s;tracted hurry in your looks, and de&s;ired me to follow you with all &s;peed, which I did implicitly enough, expecting to learn from you on the road upon what &s;trange emergency my pre&s;ence
<PB N="27" REF="21">was nece&s;&s;ary in Hell. But you plied your wings &s;o eagerly, that tho' I don't u&s;e to &s;aunter in my motions, I could not come within hearing of you all the way.

<P>A Nap quotha! would he were well out on't. The fatigue of this Bout has it &s;eems done more for him than all the vir|tues of my <HI>Rod.</HI> But if he had one grain of Mortality in him, he had &s;lept his la&s;t before this.</P>

<P>You amaze me! Nay then, &s;ome &s;trange Revolution mu&s;t be near when the Gods them&s;elves grow &s;ick.

<P>Well, you'll know by and by whe|ther I je&s;t or not. 'Tis not long &s;ince I thought as little of Sickne&s;s as you do, and <HI>Pluto</HI> as little as either of us. And let me tell you, if you had the &s;ame cau&s;e to be &s;ick that He has, I que&s;tion much if that clean alert Con&s;titution of yours, and all the firmne&s;s of your <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> could pre&s;erve you from the&s;e Di&s;orders which we have hitherto imagined were only incident to Mortals.</P>

</SP>
<PB N="29" REF="23">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. But <HI>Pluto</HI> does not always confine him&s;elf to &s;uch Rules. The <HI>Nectar,</HI> you remember was of the right generous kind, which he ply'd as long as Drinking was good. And when all the re&s;t were for going, He and <HI>Silenus,</HI> who had got into a Corner by them&s;elves, and were grown va&s;tly Loving and Facetious, laid their heads together for another Bottle, tho' he had e|nough in all con&s;cience before. Well, he was at la&s;t prevailed upon to ri&s;e, and he &s;tagger'd home as drunk as twenty Beggars, roaring, and &s;inging Sonnets to <HI>Pro&s;erpine,</HI> like a <HI>Bacchanal,</HI> all the way as he went. While the Inhabitants of the Infernal Re|gions, were &s;o tickled in their Spleens to &s;ee their King on &s;uch a merry pin, that they fell all a capering and dancing round him; and he reel'd and gambol'd as fa&s;t as the be&s;t of 'em. In &s;hort, you would have &s;plit your Sides, had you &s;een this odd Scene of Plea&s;antry. I &s;aw all that pa&s;s'd by the light of the Torches. For tho' he was affronted at my offering to conduct him home, <HI>as if he were Drunk for&s;ooth;</HI> yet I thought it was proper to follow him at a di&s;tance, and
<PB N="30" REF="24">accordingly did not lo&s;e &s;ight of him the whole way.</P>

<P>Your De&s;cription diverts me ex|treamly. <HI>Pluto</HI> is not often in &s;uch a fro|lick&s;ome vein. But pray how did his Nec|tar dige&s;t with him? I hope that did not grumble in his Guts?</P>

<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, hang it! that would not have touch'd him neither. This was only the Prelude to the Tragedy. No &s;ooner was he got home than he calls for a fre&s;h Bottle, and would needs make every body drink that was near him; laughing, and talking, and &s;inging, with all the gaiety imaginable, and &s;macking, and ki&s;&s;ing all about him.

<P>Rot 'em! I don't want to know any more about them than I do already&mdash;But to my Tale. This precious Ra&s;cal finding <HI>Pluto</HI> in a very affable tune, comes up to him, and with a deal of affected Concern in his Countenance, acco&s;ts him in this man|ner&mdash;<Q>"<HI>Dread Sir,</HI> I take it to be indi&s;pen|&s;ably incumbent upon all Subjects to ex|ert their &s;everal Capacities in the Service of their lawful Sovereigns. My Profe&s;&s;ion is Phy&s;ick, and"</Q> (after he had told a thou&s;and Lyes concerning his Education, and what Cures he had performed) <Q>"my Con|cern, &s;ays he, for your Maje&s;ty's Welfare obliges me to take the liberty to tell you, that I'm afraid you have drunk more to|night than is con&s;i&s;tent with your Health. Your Eyes look red, your Pul&s;e (here he fumbled about <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Wri&s;t) &s;trikes much too fa&s;t, and from the pre&s;ent <HI>Pleni|tude</HI> of your <HI>Va&s;cular Sy&s;tem,</HI> I can ea&s;ily progno&s;ticate, by the Rules of my <HI>Art,</HI> that if you don't purge off your <HI>Crapula,</HI> your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t unavoidably, within the &s;pace of a few hours, be &s;eized with an <HI>Ephemerous Fever,</HI> or a <HI>Febris ardens,</HI> or
<PB N="32" REF="26">perhaps drop headlong into an <HI>Apoplexy.</HI> But the&s;e Misfortunes may ea&s;ily be pre|vented, by taking two or three of my <HI>Pilu|lae Catholicae,</HI> which I invented, and al|ways prepare my &s;elf, and which &s;carce ever fail to &s;ucceed in this, or any other <HI>Intention.</HI>&mdash;There they are."</Q> With that he pulled out a Box as full of Plagues as <HI>Pandora</HI>'s, and pre&s;enting <HI>Pluto</HI> with two of his Pills,&mdash;<Q>"Your Maje&s;ty will plea&s;e to &s;wallow the&s;e, (&s;ays he,) and I &s;hall in|&s;ure you from all the bad Con&s;equences of this night's work. I am confident, if your Maje&s;ty once knew the ine&s;tima|ble Virtues of the&s;e my <HI>Pills,</HI> your Ma|je&s;ty would never go without &s;ome of them about you afterwards."</Q> Good Gods! what Simpletons does Drink make of us! <HI>Pluto,</HI> without reflecting upon the Ab&s;urdity of this Speech, or once dreaming of what he was a doing, takes the confounded <HI>Pills,</HI> and to&s;&s;es them over with great Alacrity. And indeed they &s;oon cured him of his Drunken|ne&s;s, or at lea&s;t of his Mirth. For they had not been an hour in his Stomach, till he grew mon&s;trous &s;ick, and fell a vomiting and &s;couring mo&s;t enormou&s;ly. He did &s;o
<PB N="33" REF="27">roar and cur&s;e, and to&s;s and tumble, and run hobbling and crouching up and down with his Guts in his Arms, &s;crewing his Face, &s;weating like a Hor&s;e, and looking as pale as A&s;hes, that but for his Immortality one would not imagine he could have lived in that Condition two hours. The Villain of an Empirick was &s;ent to, who, when he heard how Matters went with his Maje&s;ty; had the impudence to &s;ay, <HI>He liked him &s;o much the better that the Medicine operated well,</HI> and that he would but ju&s;t &s;tay till he made up &s;omething to <HI>alleviate the Stimulus;</HI> if there was occa&s;ion for it, and give him ea&s;e, and then would follow. But the &s;or|ry Scoundrel thought fit to &s;neak off, and he has not been heard of &s;ince. I &s;uppo&s;e he &s;culks in &s;ome blind Corner or other, but he can't long lie hid from the Puni&s;hment he de&s;erves &s;o richly. In the mean time, <HI>Pluto</HI> has continued for the&s;e two days in as bad a way as when his Phy&s;ick fir&s;t began to work. And yet, &s;ick as he was, he would not for a long time con&s;ent to the taking of any Mea&s;ures, which might di|vulge an Affair that was &s;o little to his Ho|nour; but he was forced to yield to Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="34" REF="28">at la&s;t, and di&s;patched me in great ha&s;te to find you out. And tho' he is ju&s;t now a&s;leep it &s;eems, I'm afraid there is &s;till work enough left for you. For con&s;idering what he has &s;uffered, and how mi&s;erably ill he was but lately when I left him, I am apt to &s;u&s;pect that his pre&s;ent Re&s;t is meerly owing to his Weakne&s;s, and you know much better than I, how deceitful the&s;e Truces &s;ometimes prove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;hall do what lies in my power for him; tho' I mu&s;t own I am not very &s;orry that he &s;marts for his Folly nei|ther.&mdash;But pray <HI>Mercury,</HI> can you tell me what &s;ort of People the&s;e Quacks are? For tho' they practi&s;e Phy&s;ick it &s;eems, and pre|tend to have &s;ome Intere&s;t with me, I have no Corre&s;pondence with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't imagine you have. I &s;hall tell you in as few words as po&s;&s;ible all that I know about them. You remember that in former times, none were allowed to practi&s;e Phy&s;ick but tho&s;e that were found duly qualified, and had prepared them&s;elves by a long Cour&s;e of Study for that important
<PB N="35" REF="29">Imployment. But now there is not a poor Pea&s;ant or Mechanick, but if he has two Sons, one of them mu&s;t be a <HI>Doctor,</HI> as they call them, with a vengeance, tho' it were in &s;pight of both Nature and Education. And what wi&s;e Method do you think they fall upon to accompli&s;h this great work? A very &s;hort one you'll &s;ay. They have no Notion of Education them&s;elves, and they are not able to bear the Expences of intro|ducing their Sons regularly to the knowledge of the <HI>Art.</HI> But in&s;tead of this, they place a raw unletter'd Lad for two or three years under the Care of &s;ome Apothecary, who perhaps does not know a great deal more than his Apprentice. Here he fancies he learns not only to prepare and compound Medicines, but, by peru&s;ing and Common-placing the Phy&s;icians Bills, how to apply them too for&s;ooth. And &s;o at la&s;t, by a happy Delu&s;ion, he thinks him&s;elf not only an Apothecary, but a Phy&s;ician. Thus, what by his own proper Fund of Ignorance, what by his Ma&s;ter's, improving it, he comes out at la&s;t a doubly greater Fool than he en|ter'd. But in the mean time, as Ignorance and want of Sen&s;e give him A&s;&s;urance, and
<PB N="36" REF="30">the Lowne&s;s of his Education pre&s;erves him at liberty from the comber&s;ome Shackles of Honour and Hone&s;ty, if he has but &s;leight enough to &s;ave him&s;elf from Tran&s;portation or the Gibbet, he is &s;ure to make a Lively|hood, tho' never &s;o many &s;hould &s;uffer for it. Others have fallen upon a yet ea&s;ier way of &s;caling the Heights of Phy&s;ick, by &s;etting up upon &s;omething that they call a <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> left them in a Legacy by their Grand-mother, by which they pretend infallibly to cure &s;ome one, or perhaps all Di&s;ea&s;es. And this, whe|ther it is in&s;ignificant or dangerous, they ad|mini&s;ter the &s;ame way in all Circum&s;tances, and in the &s;ame Do&s;e to Per&s;ons of all Ages, Sexes, and Con&s;titutions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hopeful Education I'll &s;wear! Well, I don't wonder that tho&s;e Fools who venture their Lives in the hands of &s;uch Bunglers, load them with &s;uch Impreca|tions at la&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e Wretches however have for &s;ome time been in great favour with <HI>Pluto.</HI> And in return for their contributing &s;o con|&s;iderably to the peopling of his Dominions,
<PB N="37" REF="31">they have had the Honour to lodge in the &s;ame Quarter with <HI>Alexander, Cae&s;ar,</HI> and the re&s;t of the noble Tribe of Man-butchers. But of late years they have &s;ent down &s;uch numerous Colonies, that it would have puz|led <HI>Pluto</HI> to account for &s;o many &s;warms (at a time when he heard nothing, by any Ad|vices from the upper World, either of Fa|mine or Pe&s;tilence, or very hot Wars) if it were not that, of all the Myriads that daily de&s;cend to Hell, there is &s;carce One of Six, but what lays the Blame of his untimely Fate upon the Quacks. So that at la&s;t, he begun to con&s;ider them with another eye, and to remit of his Indulgence towards them, as dreading they would at this rate in a &s;hort time quite de&s;troy the Brood of Mankind, and &s;o cut off all future Supplies to his Realms. But now this Affair I pre&s;ume will compleat their Di&s;grace, and entirely ruin them with <HI>Pluto.</HI> They have for a long time played their <HI>Pills, Drops,</HI> and <HI>Po|tions</HI> here upon the poor Wretches that are mi&s;erable enough be&s;ides. But there was ne|ver any ear given to their Complaints, for it was &s;u&s;pected to be all meer Fetch and Kna|very, and that they were only &s;ick to get
<PB N="38" REF="32">the Rigour and whole&s;ome Di&s;cipline of our Infernal Regions a little abated. And but the other day, one of the&s;e Mi&s;creants, as he was pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Tantalus,</HI> who was crying out of Thir&s;t after his old rate, &s;top'd and told him, that Symptom was entirely owing to the <HI>redundant Choler</HI> in his Blood, and that he could give him a <HI>Potion</HI> that would purge it off to his great Relief. Poor <HI>Tan|talus,</HI> who was glad to drink any thing, made but one Draught of his <HI>Potion,</HI> and poured a thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings upon his pre|tended Benefactor. But it proved a bitter Draught to him. For it handled him &s;o unmercifully, and, in&s;tead of having his Thir&s;t quenched by it, he called out at la&s;t &s;o pitifully for Drink, and &s;wooned away &s;o often, that he was obliged to be taken out of his Tub: And now that his great rage of Sickne&s;s is abated, they are e'en fain to cocker him up with Broths and Jellies to fill his empty Ve&s;&s;els again. Such things as the&s;e pa&s;&s;ed without being much taken notice of, and for the mo&s;t part without being credited; but I &s;hall wonder if the&s;e Varlets are not called to a &s;evere Account, now that the Gods them&s;elves can't live for
<PB N="39" REF="33">them. For you mu&s;t know that, ju&s;t about the time that <HI>Pluto</HI> took his Phy&s;ick, hone&s;t old <HI>Charon</HI> got his Do&s;e too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>No &s;ure! How in the name of won|der came <HI>Charon</HI> &s;o tractable and complai|&s;ant? I hope his Au&s;terity was not mellow|ed by a Bottle too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith; He was as &s;ober as I am ju&s;t now: but you &s;hall hear how it hap|pened. One of the&s;e Poi&s;on-mongers, who wanted a Ca&s;t over, but had not a Farthing to pay his Fare, bethought him&s;elf of a &s;ly Expedient. He takes his Seat ju&s;t by the old Waterman, and begins to make his Court by complimenting him upon his vi|gorous Con&s;titution and the <HI>Greenne&s;s</HI> of his old Age; but at the &s;ame time could not help ob&s;erving that his Skin di&s;graced them, (for you know he is not very nice about his Linnens, and does not go into a Bath perhaps once in a Century) and that he had contracted &s;omething of a <HI>Scorbutick Taint,</HI> by having lived &s;o long upon the Water. But if he would accept of &s;ome Do&s;es of his <HI>Pulvis Scelotyrbicus,</HI> and now and then
<PB N="40" REF="34">make u&s;e of the warm Bath, he might &s;oon become as &s;leek and pure as a Snake that has ju&s;t ca&s;t his Slough. <HI>Charon</HI> at fir&s;t made him &s;urly enough An&s;wers, and was like to have grown very rough, but the in|&s;inuating Ra&s;cal plied him &s;o with po&s;itive Remon&s;trances, that the &s;imple old Dotard began at la&s;t to imagine that his Skin really itched. He told him, that what he &s;aid might be true enough, but that he had not Lei&s;ure to take Phy&s;ick. The uncon&s;cio|nable Knave replied, that the Medicine which he had to offer him was an <HI>Alterative</HI> and acted in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;o that he needed not lo&s;e a Moment's Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor &s;o much as change his Diet for it. Well, not to tire you with a long Tale, <HI>Charon</HI> takes the <HI>Powders</HI> in lieu of Fare, which was all that the Ra&s;|cal wanted. And one Do&s;e has wrought him &s;o heartily, that if they were to cure him of a <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Cerberus</HI> may take the re&s;t for him. He was obliged to crawl out of his Boat into a Hut by the Ri|ver's &s;ide, where he lies cur&s;ing and bla&s;|pheming at a hideous rate, and is &s;o peevi&s;h and in &s;uch a na&s;ty pickle, that no body cares to go near him. Since this Misfor|tune
<PB N="41" REF="35">happened to him, I have been obliged to perform his Office: but to &s;ecure my &s;elf from having a <HI>Pill</HI> or <HI>Powder</HI> cramm'd down my Throat too, not a Rag of a Quack comes into the Boat as long as I'm Ma&s;ter. They make a deal of pother for Admittance, but I e'en let them &s;trole about the wrong &s;ide of the Lake till <HI>Charon</HI> is ready to take care of them him&s;elf; and if he does not take care of them with a vengeance, as &s;oon as he gets upon his Stumps again, I &s;hall &s;ay his <HI>Cho|ler is purged off</HI> effectually. There is as good as Ten or a Dozen of them already, and they are become &s;o bold, that if I did not keep them at a di&s;tance by bru&s;hing their Jackets for them when they advance too near, I be|lieve they would think of &s;torming the Boat. But I expect good Sport when they come under <HI>Charon</HI>'s Di&s;cipline. It will delight one to &s;ee how he'll tear and lay about him, and how the poor Scoundrels will &s;camper up and down, as if they walk'd upon hot Iron.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="37">Sydenham,</HI> and I don't know how many here, that are an Honour to their great Fa|ther <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> and, for the good Offices they have done Mankind, de&s;erve the im|mortal Fame and compleat Happine&s;s they now enjoy. You mu&s;t have recour&s;e to their Help, for without Nature's Means and theirs, I never do any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pluto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Help! I never could endure them: for my Empire might &s;till have re|mained an unpeopled De&s;art for them. And I have often been angry with <HI>Minos</HI> and <HI>Rha|damanth,</HI> for allotting them the &s;ame habi|tations with <HI>Solon, Lycurgus, Socrates, Ci|cero, Brutus,</HI> and the other public Benefac|tors of Mankind. I little thought ever to have Dealings of this kind with them; but I have rea&s;on to lay a&s;ide my old Grudges now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I expect you'll judge more favourably of them hereafter.&mdash;But in the mean time, <HI>Pluto,</HI> as there is nothing &s;o cur&s;t but what brings &s;ome good along with it, I humbly think this Accident might be
<PB N="44" REF="38">improved to a profitable u&s;e. You know <HI>Ixion</HI>'s Wheel is falling to pieces, the Furies Scourges are worn &s;o light and limber, that they are become meer Children's Play: In &s;hort, all the In&s;truments of Hell are going to wrack. Now to &s;ave the Expence of re|pairing them, which will make a great Gap in your Fund, what if all that pompous <HI>Apparatus,</HI> and this Variety of Tortures, were laid a&s;ide, and the Medicines of the&s;e Quacks (which come cheap enough, for all their exorbitant Bills) made u&s;e of in their &s;tead, and admini&s;tred once, twice, or thrice a Week, in proportion to the Offence, Ha|bit, and Con&s;titution of the Criminals, and <HI>pro ratione Virium &amp; Operationis.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tantalus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bla&s;t me, all the Gods! if I take <HI>Potion</HI> more.&mdash;I'll drink <HI>Phlegethon</HI> fir&s;t.&mdash;Let me into my Tub again&mdash;Oh!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>So <HI>Tantalus,</HI> you have got a quick Ear. <HI>Pluto</HI> will perhaps excu&s;e you if you &s;peak him fair. But pray, <HI>Mercury,</HI> let us hear the re&s;t of your Scheme, with <HI>Pluto</HI>'s leave, it may perhaps divert him.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="45" REF="39">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, in the mean time that the Furies may not lie out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor want an Imployment &s;uitable to their Di&s;po&s;itions; I would propo&s;e that they &s;hould have the plea&s;ure to admini&s;ter the&s;e <HI>Pills, Potions,</HI> &amp;c. and in &s;hort to perform the Office of the Quacks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what will you make of the Quacks them&s;elves? What uncommon Torments are you preparing for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for them, that they may &s;till be occupied in &s;omething Analogous to their former Trade, let it be their Bu&s;ine&s;s to take care of the Kennels, Sewers, and Com|mon-&s;hores; nor think it below them to be the Scavengers of Hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>By <HI>Jupiter,</HI> a good Contrivance! <HI>Pluto,</HI> what do you &s;ay to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Merc.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;Ye Gods! <HI>Pluto</HI> is as bad as ever! How he heaves! how he &s;weats! how he's convul&s;ed! as if his whole Frame
<PB N="46" REF="40">were disjointed! I mu&s;t make Di&s;patch, and &s;end hither <HI>Hippocrates</HI> and &s;ome of the re&s;t of the Phy&s;icians, and then to the Oar again. Do you, <HI>Hygeia,</HI> &s;tay here in the mean time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hyg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall. Fare you well, <HI>Mercury,</HI> and make ha&s;te.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Letter was found in the Streets, where it had probably been dropt by Mr. <HI>W&mdash;d.</HI> This accident has in all likelihood deprived tho&s;e impartial Re|cords of Fame, <HI>The London Evening Po&s;t</HI> and <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> of the Honour of u&s;her|ing it into the World. But that it may not be entirely lo&s;t, neither to the Public nor that illu&s;trious Per&s;on to whom it does Ju&s;|tice, I take the liberty to print it here.</P>
<Q>To the greate&s;t of &s;elf-taught Phy&s;icians, to the Sage pregnant with Knowledge not revealed by Mortal Pens, to the Dragon's Eye of Sagacity, to the far-fam'd Ma&s;ter of the Pill of Pills and Drop of Drops, to the in|vincible <HI>J&mdash; W&mdash;, Usbek</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> greeting.</Q>
<P>_I Took the wondrous Pill which thou &s;ente&s;t me, and lay for three Days and three Nights under the de&s;potic Sovereignty of Phy&s;ick. Almighty <HI>Alla!</HI> How did the Billows of Sickne&s;s over|whelm
<PB N="48" REF="42">me! How did the Rage of vollied Torments &s;hake my fle&s;hly Man&s;ion almo&s;t to ruins, while my trembling Soul thought of nothing but Flight! But now ro&s;y Health &s;miles again upon me, and my Years look green in a new Spring: For which I thank thy &s;pirit-giving Hand, and &s;hall ever cele|brate thy immortal Name with Prai&s;es lofty as <HI>Imaus,</HI> &s;weet-&s;melling as the &s;picy Vales of <HI>Arabia.</HI> Hail, enormous <HI>Ma&s;s of Pilular</HI> Merit! Thou mighty Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the <HI>Uni|ver&s;al Remedy,</HI> the <HI>Pill</HI> of <HI>Strength,</HI> the <HI>Drop</HI> of <HI>Energy,</HI> the <HI>Arcanum</HI> of the <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> &s;uch as never ro&s;e from the &s;ecret Furnace of my&s;terious vaunting <HI>Paracel&s;us!</HI> (For not the golden Pill of Day di&s;per&s;es Influence more vivifying than thine Terre&s;trial and of Mineral Birth!) Thou, for whom the <HI>Great</HI> (O glorious Task!) wield their deputed Pens! And to whom the <HI>Judges of the Earth</HI> do Ju&s;tice! Thou, who <HI>compre&s;&s;e&s;t the Glands</HI> of the <HI>Paralytic</HI> Eye, and admini&s;tre&s;t to the Wretched, the &s;weet <HI>relief of Tears! For thrice wretched they to whom this Comfort is denied!</HI> In a word, thou great earthly Mover of the obedient
<PB N="49" REF="43">Microco&s;m! all hail! And may I join to thee, Him next in Name? who <HI>daily</HI> thun|ders almo&s;t with equal Force on my a&s;toun|ded Ear: Him, the vindictive Scourge of <HI>Worms!</HI> Him, greater than the Flower of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chivalry, the Boa&s;t of ancient Time, <HI>St. George!</HI> Him, con&s;picuous with the Spoils of many a vanqui&s;h'd Mon&s;ter! And to whom contending Monarchs, ju&s;tled from the middle of the Sheets of Fame, di|urnally give place! And let my upright heart be&s;tow upon your whole illu&s;trious Brother|hood their due &s;hare of Incen&s;e. <HI>Alla</HI> for|bid that I &s;hould pa&s;s them in &s;tupid Silence! For neither is their Renown unknown to me. O all ye (who can count you, innume|rable and bright as the Stars!) Ye, who without the help of vain Science, and un|cramped by &s;tiff Education, have gained the proud heights of Phy&s;ick! Ye Worthies of <HI>Emetic</HI> Renown! Ye who&s;e skilful hands weed the too luxuriant animal Kingdom! Ye who&s;e <HI>Pills</HI> and <HI>Potions purge the World!</HI> Let me &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at your Power, and bid my voracious Appetite of Wonders riot eternally on your miraculous Might. For you command, and De&s;truction opens wide
<PB N="50" REF="44">her devouring Jaws! The wrathful Pe&s;ti|lence waits your tremendous Nod! You teach the <HI>impri&s;oned Aphrodi&s;iack</HI> Bane to rage, and the great ones of the Earth tremble! They tremble, yea and melt in fearful <HI>Sweats</HI> at your Power! That Power, the liberal Gift of au&s;picious Nature, the Envy and A&s;toni&s;h|ment of the Learned. O unbought Erudi|tion! More to be valued far than the Moun|tains of <HI>Ophir</HI> teeming with Gold, or the ma&s;&s;y Pearls of the Orient!&mdash;O when will come the&s;e <HI>Golden Days</HI> when Phy&s;icians &s;hall be all of one <HI>Sect?</HI> When <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> when <HI>Galen;</HI> when <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> &s;hall be no more? When <HI>Spontaneous</HI> Knowledge &s;hall &s;pring from the <HI>uncultivated</HI> Soil? When the grief of Reading and tedious Applica|tion &s;hall cea&s;e? When the univer&s;al Smoak of blazing Libraries &s;hall a&s;cend, and wrap the happy Day in a more glorious Night? And when the Profe&s;&s;ors of the healing Art &s;hall, with one Mind, entirely re&s;ign them&s;elves to <HI>enlightening</HI> Nature, and like you (O &s;ole <HI>in&s;pired Phy&s;icians!</HI>) tru&s;t to <HI>In&s;piration</HI> alone? Even then when a new <HI>Gothic</HI> Inundation &s;hall overwhelm the Earth, and the la&s;t foot&s;teps of abhorred Learning
<PB N="51" REF="45">&s;hall melt away. Happy! Oh! infinitely happy! they, whom kind Nature locks up in the dark Womb of Time, to &s;ally forth with impetuous eagerne&s;s into the Enjoy|ment of the&s;e bli&s;sful Days! Oh! too happy already! if they could but know their hap|pine&s;s. For even we, the pre&s;ent Genera|tion of Mortals, we (thank Heaven!) ta&s;te the Sweets of the&s;e delicious Days: Ta&s;te, and envy the &s;leeping Seeds of our late Po&s;|terity. Yes, in you we ta&s;te the&s;e Joys, O Godlike Deliverers from mortal Woes, from the Bondage of the Fle&s;h, and from all the Sorrows and Infirmities that <HI>Fle&s;h is Heir to!</HI> O! that I could wield the irre&s;i&s;table Bolts of <HI>Demo&s;thenian</HI> Eloquence! Oh! for the Tongues of Ten thou&s;and <HI>Seraphims</HI> to &s;ing your Prai&s;es, and hu&s;h with con&s;cious Shame the mi&s;tuned <HI>Spheres!</HI> For &s;ure no Mortal, not all the Mortals that have &s;prung from the Loins of the fir&s;t Man, with all that &s;hall precede the la&s;t Cru&s;h of this Sy&s;tem, joined in full Concert, could warble <HI>Elogiums</HI> worthy you. Let me not therefore violate the &s;acred Theme, nor touch your divine Names with my fle&s;hly Lips, le&s;t a wrath|ful <HI>Cancer</HI> &s;hould con&s;ume them, or a <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ioned
<PB N="52" REF="46">Pal&s;y</HI> revenge you on my profane Tongue. And yet&mdash;But whither do the&s;e Raptures hurry me? Tran&s;ported by the in|&s;piring Subject, I have unawares &s;welled my Letter of acknowledgment to Thee, with an <HI>Encomium</HI> upon the Society of which thou ju&s;tly claime&s;t to be the Head. And now, before I lay down my Pen, I mu&s;t tell thee that, &s;mit with an ab&s;olute Curio&s;ity, I de|&s;ign a Vi&s;it this Winter to thy amazing Country: The Land of Wonders, where, be&s;ides the almo&s;t incredible Feats of thy a&s;|toni&s;hing Fraternity, a thou&s;and other Pro|digies, worthy (if Fame &s;ays true) of eter|nal Admiration, grow. For I hear of Things and Manners marvelous, &s;carce utterable by mortal Tongues, and not to be believed with|out the Vouchers of one's proper Eyes. <HI>Alla</HI> pre&s;erve thee, &s;age <HI>J&mdash;&s;&mdash;ah.</HI></P>
