<HEAD>REFLEXIONS Concerning the VIRTUES OF <HI>TAR WATER,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_TAR WATER,</HI> as it is lately ordered by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> being at pre&s;ent al|mo&s;t as univer&s;al in its U&s;e as it is proved to be in its Properties, by this learned Author; I hope it will not be thought pre&s;umptuous in me to undertake to prove why, and in what Manner, it may be im|prov'd in its excellent Qualifications, by a particular Management in its Preparation, &s;ince nothing but the general Good of Mankind is hereby aimed at. And tho' the
<PB N="4" REF="3">learned Bi&s;hop has given Directions to pre|pare it in a very &s;imple Manner, probably with the Intention that it might be equally &s;erviceable to the Poor and Rich, yet I think few Rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;ign'd, why the Rich may not be &s;upplied with a mo&s;e neat and certainly a more efficacious Re|medy; e&s;pecially, &s;ince the Price, even then, will not much exceed the pre&s;ent Rate, as I &s;hall endeavour to prove.</P>
<P><HI>Norway</HI> Tar, as it is now imported, is unque&s;tionably the be&s;t for this mo&s;t noble Medicine, as being endowed with the mo&s;t fragrant and &s;ubtile Parts, beyond other Tars, which is evident by its Smell, and by its Ta&s;te, as being lea&s;t acrimonious; and it has been proved by &s;everal ingenious Chemi&s;ts, that it partakes lea&s;t of that heat|ing &s;ulphurous Property, which abounds in all the&s;e Bal&s;ams, either more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>Common Tar, or Tar from hot Climates, is not &s;o well Saturated with this fine vola|tile aromatic Flavour. This, perhaps, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, may be owing to the In|fluence of the Sun, which exhales all the fine&s;t Parts, except tho&s;e that are clo&s;ely connected, and &s;uppre&s;s'd by the vi&s;cid Juices of the Trees; whereas in colder Re|gions, the Pores of the Trees are more
<PB N="5" REF="4">clo&s;e and compact, and by that means the&s;e &s;ubtile Parts are more detain'd and lock'd up in their proper Cells, from whence pro|ceeds the &s;iner Flavour. But notwith&s;tand|ing this, the be&s;t <HI>Norway</HI> Tar, as it is now imported, is &s;o loaded with heteroge|neous Matter, &s;uch as Sticks, Straws, Flies, Sand, and various other Bodies which can|not be defined, and which cannot &s;ub&s;ide in the Barrel by Rea&s;on of its Con&s;i&s;tence or Thickne&s;s, (it being defign'd more for the U&s;e of Ships than Medicine) that a Method ought to be con&s;idered which Way to refine it, like other natural Bal|&s;ams, without damaging its natural Proper|ties. This none but the chemic Art can well effect, &s;o that it is needle&s;s to de|liver the Proce&s;s, &s;ince none but Chemi&s;ts can perform it with Succe&s;s; and that they can do at a trifling Expence. By this Method it is &s;o contriv'd, that the pun|gent Ta&s;te of the Water is greatly le&s;&s;en'd, and it is not &s;o apt to regurgitate upon weak Stomachs; which frequently hap|pens to the fair Sex, and renders them in|capable of retaining it, for who&s;e parti|cular Maladies it is peculiarly excellent, as is unque&s;tionably prov'd by the Au|thor of <HI>Siris,</HI> Sect. 51, 99, 101, and 118.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>The next Thing I &s;hall take notice of is the Water. Our Author has not expre&s;ly informed us what Sort to make u&s;e of; &s;o that we might u&s;e any Sort indifferently, was it not that our own Rea&s;on is &s;ufficient to convince us what Sort to prefer; but le&s;t the injudicious Part of Mankind may not comprehend what is meant, I &s;hall endea|vour to prove what Water ought to be preferred in compounding this mo&s;t valu|able Medicine.</P>
<P>Our Author tells us in Sect. 110 of his <HI>Siris,</HI> that <HI>Tar Water</HI> ought to be taken for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time in chronic Ca&s;es, &s;uch as the Gravel, Gout, Scurvy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that he has known very great Advantages pro|cured thereby, which did not begin to appear till it had been taken two or three Months; which Circum&s;tance in all Alteratives ought to be, but &s;eldom is, regarded: now, as &s;uch a long Time mu&s;t be allowed to compleat the Cure of a chronic Di&s;temper, it fol|lows, that a large Quantity of Water mu&s;t be drank during this Time, perhaps the Quantity of twenty or thirty Gallons, or it may be three Times as much, before it be entirely forborn. But admit, that in painful Di&s;tempers, as the Gout and Rheumati&s;m, it &s;hou'd only procure Ea&s;e, during the taking it, and a Relap&s;e &s;hou'd en&s;ue upon
<PB N="7" REF="6">omitting it, as it may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected &s;ometimes to fall &s;hort of a perfect Cure in the Gout or Scurvy; then it naturally fol|lows, that a Patient wou'd continue taking it, perhaps for Years, or, &s;o long as he per|ceived any good Effect by its U&s;e. Now as there is thus &s;ometimes a Nece&s;&s;ity for drinking &s;o great a Quantity of Water, it may ju&s;tly be di&s;puted whether the Cure might not be of wor&s;e Con&s;equence to the Patient than the Di&s;ea&s;e; I mean, by employing an improper Water in ma|king the Medicine: For mo&s;t Waters are widely different in their Properties, accord|ing to the various Sources from whence they ari&s;e; as for In&s;tance, Well-Waters chiefly are impregnated with mineral or me|talline Particles, and River-Waters, which I &s;uppo&s;e are chiefly u&s;ed in <HI>London</HI> for this Medicine, abound with divers heteroge|neous Particles, according to the various Soils they glide upon; and there is no Wa|ter at all &s;o pure, but is loaded either more or le&s;s, with &s;omething foreign to it&s;elf: If any one di&s;putes the Truth of this, let him but in&s;pect the Infide of one of the Lady's Tea-kettles, and that will certainly convince him, or look into one of the lea|den Pipes which conveys this Water for Kitchen U&s;e, even if it has been laid but for three Months, and he will find the In|&s;ide
<PB N="8" REF="7">lined with a &s;tony Concrete: Then, without any cavilling or entering into any ab&s;tru&s;e Mathematical Demon&s;tration in this Point, I &s;hall leave every one to judge what mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of drinking &s;o much of this crude Water, which mu&s;t be done in the common Method of making <HI>Tar Water.</HI></P>
<P>But that I may not be thought &s;in|gular in my Opinion, I &s;hall ju&s;t beg leave to &s;ubjoin &s;ome Quotations from Au|thors of e&s;tabli&s;hed Reputation for Learn|ing and Genius, to confirm what I have already advanced, and then propo&s;e a Me|thod how to avoid this Evil at a &s;mall Ex|pence.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Naturali&s;ts tell us of &s;urprizing In|&s;tances of &s;ome Waters, which are of &s;uch a petrifying Nature, that in Rivulets where|in Water-mills have been fixed, the Peri|phery which catches the Water in &s;mall Boxes has been petrified to &s;uch a Degree, that the Owners have been obliged to clear it frequently with proper In&s;truments, in order to facilitate the Motion of the Wheel: &s;uch an In&s;tance as this I have &s;een, and whoever in&s;pects the Water-works of <HI>Lon|don</HI> Bridge, will find &s;omething to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> has furni&s;hed us with &s;ome Hints of this Kind, in his la&s;t E&s;&s;ay on Poi&s;ons. At <HI>Paris,</HI> it has been remarked, that the River <HI>Seine</HI> is &s;o full of &s;tony Cor|pu&s;cles, that the Inhabitants there are more &s;ubject to the Stone and Gravel, than at other Places.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;uppo&s;e, what is very po&s;&s;ible, that Waters may be impregnated with Me|tallic Particles of &s;ome Ore or other; then the&s;e, according to their various Gravita|tions, the Capacities of the Canals or Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;uch like Circum&s;tances, (when they come to circulate in the human Body) mu&s;t attract and be attracted by other Particles, which are already depo&s;ited either in the Kidneys, Bladder, or other &s;ecretory Pa&s;&s;ages, and cannot but form, and, as it were, cement a &s;tony Sub&s;tance, which, 'tis greatly to be feared, will defeat all the Efforts and &s;overeign di&s;&s;olving Pro|perties of <HI>Tar Water</HI> it&s;elf; nay, much &s;tronger Medicines; of which the once famed Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s are an In&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of what has been &s;aid, and the Idea, which may be con|ceived of the infinite Number of &s;mall Ducts or &s;ecretory Ve&s;&s;els, through which this Liquor mu&s;t be &s;trained, ought to
<PB N="10" REF="9">give us convincing Demon&s;trations, why it is as likely to procure Ob&s;tructions, as to remove them, and, con&s;equently, lay the very Foundation for all Chronic De&s;ea&s;es, which, in my Opinion, mu&s;t and do pro|ceed from one and the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> ob&s;erves, that Waters which pa&s;s through a clayi&s;h Bottom, mu&s;t par|take of metallic Particles, becau&s;e Clay is a mineral Glebe; and that the&s;e Particles are not to be ma&s;ter'd, that is, they can|not be dige&s;ted in the human Body; and therefore he concludes, they cannot but cau&s;e calculous Concretions in the Kidneys, Bladder, and Joints. If this be the Ca&s;e, we need not wonder why in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration is ob&s;tructed by them; and thus &s;ays the great <HI>Sanctorius</HI> in <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <HI>Aphor.</HI> 2. that heavy Water converts the Matter of Tran&s;pira|tion into an Ichor, which being retain'd, inchuces a Cachexy, which the learn'd Au|thor of <HI>Tar Water</HI> &s;ays, (<HI>Sect.</HI> 93.) is of the &s;ame Kind with the Scurvy, proceeds from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, and is attended with like Symptoms; which are &s;o mani|fold and various, that the Scurvy may be looked on as a general Cachexy infecting the whole Habit, and vitiating all the Di|ge&s;tions.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>From hence proceed Pains in the Limbs, livid Pu&s;tules and Ulcers in the Body, with great Inflammation from the Acri|mony of the ob&s;tructed Ichor, or per&s;pira|ble Matter. Hy&s;terical Maladies are occa|&s;ioned by the &s;ame Means; for the &s;aid <HI>Sanctorius</HI> ob&s;erves, in <HI>Sect,</HI> 3. <HI>Aphor.</HI> 13. that the Wind, &s;o in&s;eparable from tho&s;e Ca&s;es, is nothing el&s;e than the Fluid of Per&s;piration crude and unfini&s;hed: And a late very learned Author gives us the Hi|&s;tory of a Lady, his Relation, who was very much afflicted with frequent Returns of violent Cholic Pains, till &s;he was advis'd by the noble <HI>Van Helmont,</HI> not to drink, as &s;he then did, Beer brew'd with Well|water, and &s;oon after her Health was &s;o far owing to that Management, that an Error in it, was unavoidably followed with the u&s;ual Complaint.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that all Per&s;ons are not alike &s;ubject to the Stone and Gravel, and that when Water is mix'd with the oily and acid Particles of the Ballam, it may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relax the Ve&s;&s;els, and by that means give Liberty to the ob|&s;tructed Matter to recover its Circulation or Secretion; but it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that mo&s;t Con&s;titutions are more or le&s;s &s;ubject to Gravel, as appears upon Di&s;|&s;ections,
<PB N="12" REF="11">and by a &s;andy Sediment depo|&s;ited in the Urine at various Times; it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd too, whether the attra|ctive Force of the&s;e &s;tony Particles, or the relaxing or attenuating Properties of <HI>Tar Water</HI> predominate; which I &s;hould ima|gine (con&s;idering the Narrowne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;els or Ducts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thro' which it mu&s;t pa&s;s, whereby con&s;equently the Particles are brought more within the Sphere of one an|others Attraction) mu&s;t be yielded to the former; e&s;pecially &s;ince it is a known Law in Mechanics, that in all Bodies or Particles of Matter, the attractive Force is as their Solidities, and Points in Contact, and that the attractive Force is infinitely greater at the Point of Contact, or extremely near it, than at any determined Di&s;tance. Be&s;ides, it is allowed that this Bal&s;am con|tains an Acid, which incorporates with Water; and there mu&s;t be a Sulphur be|cau&s;e there is an Acid, for <HI>Homberg</HI> &s;ays, the Acid is always join'd to Sul|phur, <HI>Vide Siris,</HI> Sect. 129, and Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;ays, that whatever at|tracts and is attracted &s;trongly, is an Acid, <HI>ib. Sect.</HI> 130. The la&s;t Author has al&s;o proved, that Acids which lay &s;uppre&s;s'd in &s;ulphurous Bodies, attract earthy ones more &s;trongly than their own; from whence
<PB N="13" REF="12">he accounts for Fermentation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may be &s;een fully explain'd, as it is printed in the &s;econd Volume of Dr. <HI>Harris</HI>'s <HI>Lexicon Technicum.</HI> From hence it fol|lows, that when the&s;e acid Particles meet with earthy ones, which abound in Water, they cannot but attract them; and when the&s;e Particles &s;o attracted, do, by any Mo|tion or Impul&s;e meet with other Particles of a homogeneal Nature with them&s;elves, which they cannot fail to do, either in the Bladder, Kidneys, or other Ve&s;&s;els in the Body, then it is that they attract each other mo&s;t &s;trongly, and &s;o form Ob|&s;tructions in this or that Ve&s;&s;el or Duct, which makes lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, in &s;pite of all the Intermediation of the Oil in <HI>Tar Wa|ter,</HI> which bears but a &s;mall Proportion to the acid or attractive Force.</P>
<P>But to return to our Subject, Water is of &s;o con&s;tant a Service in preparing our Diet as well as Medicine, that it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be the Vehicle of all our Nouri&s;hment, &s;o that we cannot be too inqui&s;itive into its Nature and Difference, nor too nice in our Choice of it; and as it is the only Men&s;truum of &s;o noble a Medicine as <HI>Tar Water,</HI> it cannot be ami&s;s to try and prove, if by our Art we can
<PB N="14" REF="13">dive&s;t it of all its noxious Qualities, &s;ince we can find none without, and by that Means make it approach nearer to a Prin|ciple; when it will be fitte&s;t to join and cohere with the mo&s;t &s;ubtile Parts of that excellent Bal&s;am called <HI>Tar.</HI></P>
<P>This mu&s;t be re&s;olved into the noble Art of Chemi&s;try, the experimental Part of which can only convince us, that Wa|ters may be purified &s;o as to partake little, or, perhaps, nothing, of that noxious Qua|lity &s;o obvious in them; and I have been convinced of this, by frequent Repetitions of various Proce&s;&s;es perform'd with various Gla&s;&s;es within the&s;e two Months pa&s;t, which would take up too much Room to in&s;ert in this Place. What is here &s;aid may occa&s;ion various Objections, e&s;pecial|ly from tho&s;e at pre&s;ent concerned in the common Preparation of <HI>Tar Water;</HI> but I dare venture to affim, if the Que&s;tion was put to any Chemi&s;t, nay to tho&s;e who have only acquired a &s;uperficial Know|ledge in Phy&s;ick, it would not be di&s;puted, but Waters may be purified by various Means to a great Degree, though they might &s;till fall &s;hort of that Perfection which cannot be perform'd effectually, without the Addition of a &s;econd Princi|ple,
<PB N="15" REF="14">which has been &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;cover'd after a tedious Cour&s;e of Experiments: For Di&s;tillation of Water alone, will not an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e; &s;ince after it has been di&s;tilled two or three Times, it will &s;till continue to form a &s;tony Concrete in the In&s;ide of any Ve&s;&s;el it is boiled or even &s;immered in; and it is very ea&s;y to ima|gine what Con&s;equences a continued Quantity may produce, when &s;trained through the fine capillary Ve&s;&s;els in a human Body; which, as our great Author ob|&s;erves in Sect. 54, of his <HI>Siris,</HI> are &s;aid to be &s;o &s;mall, that one Grain of Sand would cover the Mouths of more than a hundred Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved before, and it may be ju&s;tly repeated, that none but a Chemi&s;t can &s;o dexterou&s;ly prepare this Water, &s;o as to free it from what is foreign to it&s;elf, con&s;equently no Per&s;on can better progno&s;ticate what Effects may proceed from its U&s;e; for as our learned Bi&s;hop ob&s;erves from <HI>Socrates,</HI> Sect. 253, You and the Cook may judge of a Di&s;h on the Table equally well, but while the Di&s;h is making, the Cook can better foretel what will en&s;ue from this or that Manner of compo&s;ing it; con&s;e|quently
<PB N="16" REF="15">the Chemi&s;t can judge be&s;t what will en&s;ue from this or that manner of making a Medicine. People addicted to cen&s;ure, may give out that &s;elf Intere&s;t is the only Motive that has induced me to publi&s;h this Pamphlet, becau&s;e the Method of refining the two Principles is not recited; to which I an&s;wer, that the Chemic Province is too much invaded al|ready by Empiries and Impo&s;tors, and tho&s;e who are di&s;&s;atisfied in this Point, are left to their own Option, either to con|tinue drinking common <HI>Tar Water,</HI> or el&s;e apply to a Chemi&s;t for the other, &s;ince it is, at the &s;ame Time with this Book, publi&s;hed, where the genuine may be had at an ea&s;y Expence.</P>
<P>And though the Preference of this Me|dicine may be imagined from the Rea&s;ons already given, yet I am far from di&s;parag|ing, or a&s;&s;uming the lea&s;t Merit due to, our original and illu&s;trious Author the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cloyne;</HI> his excellent Treati&s;e certainly de&s;erves the greate&s;t Applau&s;e and Homage from every Rank, and from Per&s;ons of Genius; and it would be folly in me to think him in the lea&s;t ignorant, either of theoretical or experimental Part of Chemi&s;try; what he has done may be more
<PB N="17" REF="16">plau&s;ibly accounted for, from the Satisfa|ction he enjoyed in di&s;covering a Medicine &s;o univer&s;al, and ea&s;y in its Purcha&s;e to Rich and Poor; yet no Rea&s;ons can be a&s;&s;igned why we may not exerci&s;e our Faculties in meliorating that Medicine, and prove it more univer&s;al both by Rea&s;on and practi|cal Experience.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude with making &s;ome Remarks upon the Manner of preparing this mo&s;t noble Medicine, which when rightly managed, will ju&s;tly de&s;erve all the Encomiums conferred upon it. Its pre&s;ent Preparation is the mo&s;t improper that can be, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf has proved by his own Philo&s;ophy, in &s;everal Parts of his Trea|ti&s;e; for by his ordering it to be &s;tirred with a Ladle, or flat Stick, one may &s;u&s;pect that he and mo&s;t others hitherto have pre|pared it in an open Ve&s;&s;el, which mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with all manner of Philo&s;ophy. He lays great &s;tre&s;s upon its Volatility, its &s;ubtile Oil or Acid, and its oily volatile ve|getable Salt, which he &s;ays are the very Flower of its &s;pecific Qualities; this makes it appear more &s;trange, that a Medicine endowed with &s;uch fine volatile Parts, &s;hould be made in an open Ve&s;&s;el, unle&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="17">we intended to evaporate, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rob it of this Volatility: For he has taught us, in <HI>Sect.</HI> 46. that all the fine&s;t and pure&s;t Parts of any Volatile very ea&s;ily a&s;cend fir&s;t: Where then mu&s;t all the&s;e fine volatile, oily, and &s;ub|tile acid Parts, as he calls them, go to, in a Ve&s;&s;el uncovered? It ought to be our chiefe&s;t Care to pre&s;erve them. What is the Worth of the once greatly fancied Spirits of Scurvigra&s;s, after they have &s;tood forty eight Hours in an open Ve&s;&s;el? <HI>Sal Armoniac</HI> and Salts of Tartar, perhaps, have le&s;s Volatility, than either <HI>Tar</HI> or <HI>Water,</HI> when &s;ingle, yet upon the lea&s;t mixing them one with the other, there immediately ari&s;es a Volatility, which affects the No&s;e &s;o &s;trongly, as not to be endured. But tho' this will greatly admit of a Compari&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et it does not exactly &s;olve the pre&s;ent Problem: For, Tar being impregnated with &s;uch &s;ubtile Parts, which are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed from flying off by Rea&s;on of the Vi&s;cidity of its component Parts, yet when it comes to be divided, and, as it were, fluxed with &s;uch a Fluid as Water, then all its volatile Parts are di&s;engaged, and &s;et loo&s;e from their Impri&s;onment, and cannot fail to e&s;cape according to their different Degrees of Pu|rity; e&s;pecially if the Water be refined, for it is then rendred much fitter for Infu&s;ion,
<PB N="19" REF="18">becau&s;e its Parts, which before were gro&s;s and heavy, being now made &s;mall, and, as it were, volatile, it is fitted to inlinuate it&s;elf into the mo&s;t remote Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, and there adjoin it&s;elf to the mo&s;t &s;ubtile parts of the Subject, which before were &s;o clo&s;ely &s;hut up in the&s;e narrow Cells, as to debar the Entrance of more crude aqueous Particles: Much in the Manner as Spirits of Wine will di&s;&s;olve a re&s;inous Sub&s;tance &s;ooner than Water; for the &s;pirituous Particles being more &s;ubtile and exceedingly &s;maller than tho&s;e of Water, they can more readily enter into the In|ter&s;tices of the Re&s;in, and ea&s;ily di&s;|join its Parts, which are too clo&s;ely uni|ted for the gro&s;s Corpu&s;cles of Water to enter.</P>
<P>Hence it is manife&s;t, that purified Wa|ter is not only incomparably better adapted to enter into the Stage of Circulation in human Bodies, but likewi&s;e more appro|priated to extract a Tincture from Vege|tables or their Bal&s;ams; which is the &s;ole Aim of our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
