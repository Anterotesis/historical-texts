<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;torian is an ab&s;olute Stranger to mo&s;t of the People of the pre&s;ent Age, therefore can never pretend to the Hon|our of &s;atyrizing any Man, or any Body of Men.</P>
<P>HE has had a Bundle of Papers left him by a deceas'd Friend, who was infinitely more capable of putting them in Form, than he can pretend to, tho' the Reclu&s;ene&s;s of his Life afforded him abundant Lei&s;ure. The&s;e Papers contain'd a Variety of Ob&s;ervations, which, he thought, might be u&s;eful to Mankind. He has extended the&s;e Ob&s;ervations; he has, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, commented on them; he has dre&s;s'd them in the Garb of the Times; he has given them the Air of Romance, and he gives
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
to the Reader, the ab&s;olute Power of deter|mining whether he has done <HI>RIGHT</HI> or <HI>WRONG.</HI></P>
<P>THE Hi&s;torian has this Advantage over mo&s;t others, and this only, That the Trifle he now pre&s;ents to the Publick, has a fair Chance of being impartially dealt with; for, as he is unknown, and will remain &s;o, the critical Eye cannot condemn his Per&s;on, whatever it may his Work. His Scribbling may be abu&s;ed, but he has taken Care to &s;ecure his Per&s;on from &s;uch Treatment, tho' he is not con&s;cious that he has ever merited it.</P>
<P>IRONY, well managed, has ever been a &s;ucce&s;sful Way to fix the Attention; and <HI>NOVEL</HI> and <HI>ROMANCE</HI> may be conducted to very laudable Purpo&s;es, and an&s;wer the End of more learned Writings. The Moral of the following Hi&s;tory may corre&s;pond with an old phy&s;ical Aphori&s;m, which I apprehend may be found in the <HI>SCHOLA SALERNI,</HI> wrote in the Days of <HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Conqueror.</P>
<Q><PB N="vii" REF="6">
<L>Qui medicas artes exercet, no&s;cere partes</L>

<L>Horum quodque datum per &s;e, vomitum atque &s;creatum</L>

<P>PURE and elegant Latin is not to be expected in Monki&s;h Ver&s;es, and a cla&s;&s;ical Nicety is too unrea&s;onable a Reque&s;t. Such as
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
they are, they afford me a Conjecture, that the learned <HI>DOCTOR MEAD</HI> is oblig'd to them, at lea&s;t for the Title of his new Book, <HI>Mo|nita et Praecepta Medica.</HI> Be this at it will, I &s;hall only beg Leave to give, to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, their Meaning in his own Language. <Q>A &s;kilful Phy&s;ician will con&s;ult the Con|&s;titution of his Patient, and not madly pour down even the mo&s;t &s;alutary Medi|cines. Some Herbs are fill'd with &s;our, and &s;ome with bitter Juices, too di&s;a|greeable to be given &s;ingly. Phy&s;ick, like good Coun&s;el, mu&s;t be admini&s;ter'd with Caution, or the Stomach will re|volt. The Patient mu&s;t be decoy'd into a Cure, and the unpalatable Drug mu&s;t be convey'd in the mo&s;t innocent Vehicle his Judgment can furni&s;h. He who acts otherwi&s;e, merits not the Title of a Phy|&s;ician, but of a Quack.</Q></P>

<PB N="3" REF="10">
Account of JOHN CONNOR.&mdash;I will not affirm that I have acted <HI>impartially,</HI> be|cau&s;e I will not pre&s;ume doing, what, I am afraid, no Hi&s;torian <HI>ever did.</HI> If I a&s;&s;ure my Readers I am quite <HI>unbias'd,</HI> yet I hope to be indulged, like the Re&s;t of my Bre|thren, when I &s;ometimes act <HI>otherwi&s;e.</HI> I cannot avoid &s;aying, I have con&s;ulted the Ea&s;e of my Reader as much as po&s;&s;ible, by not &s;welling this Work into <HI>Twenty Volumes.</HI> As a Proof of my Indulgence, I have &s;hortened my Prefatory Di&s;cour&s;e and this Introduction above <HI>One Hundred Pages,</HI> and &s;hall proceed directly to the Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>JEREMIAH CONNOR, the Father of JOHN, who&s;e Story I now write, had been a well made, athletic Man, and a Soldier in <HI>King</HI> WILLIAM'S Army in the War in <HI>Ireland.</HI> When that Matter was &s;ettled, he quitted that Sort of Life, and pa&s;&s;ing through &s;un|dry Services, at la&s;t &s;ettled with Sir <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> a Gentleman of great Honour and Fortune, in the County of <HI>Limerick,</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Here he lived, and his Warlike <HI>Scars of Credit,</HI> made him a&s;&s;ume &s;ome Authority, and furni&s;hed a large Fund for Conver&s;ation. He found the Happine&s;s of being Virtuous in the <HI>Cau&s;e of Liberty</HI> and <HI>Common-Sen&s;e.</HI> Though he was one of the
<PB N="4" REF="11">
famous <HI>Enni&s;killiners</HI> that joyn'd <HI>King Wil|liam,</HI> yet his Reward, like other <HI>great Men,</HI> was confined to the &s;ecret Plea&s;ure of having done <HI>his Duty.</HI></P>
<P>IN this Family liv'd DOLLY BRIGHT, who perform'd the Function of <HI>Landry-Maid;</HI> &s;he was young and hand&s;ome; and <HI>Jerry</HI> ob&s;erving, &s;he had a docile and tractable Turn, he encourag'd her in it. Being him&s;elf a Man of <HI>Learning,</HI> he took &s;ome Pains to inculcate all his Knowledge, and taught her to <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Write.</HI> The Fame of her Erudition a little hightened her Vanity, e&s;pecially when <HI>Sir Roger</HI> ex|amined her him&s;elf, and declaring her a very &s;urpri&s;ing Genius, gave her a Ki&s;s and <HI>two Guineas</HI> to buy a Gown and Linnen.&mdash; This unfortunate Pre&s;ent, and a few more of the &s;ame Nature, at la&s;t alarm'd <HI>Lady Thornton,</HI> and brought on &s;ome Alteration, in which the Lady &s;eem'd in the Right. All <HI>Sir Roger</HI>'s Affirmations were of no Effect; my Lady mo&s;t violently prote&s;ted <HI>the impudent Slut &s;hould quit the Hou&s;e, or &s;he would</HI>&mdash;. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> knew the World, and what's more, he knew him&s;elf and his Wife, which determined him to make all this ea&s;y. He told <HI>Jerry Connor,</HI> that if he would marry <HI>Dolly Bright,</HI> he would give him a Cabbin and five Acres of
<PB N="5" REF="12" MS="y">
Ground at a &s;mall Rent, and compleat his Happine&s;s, who had been &s;o careful of her Education.</P>
<P>LADY THORNTON objected to this, but finding Sir <HI>Roger</HI> grow warm and &s;omewhat peremptory, &s;he acquie&s;ced.&mdash;Though <HI>Jerry Connor</HI> was thirty Years older than <HI>Dolly,</HI> they willingly con&s;ented to the Match, and Peace was re&s;tor'd to the Family.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Jack</HI>'s Parents were fix'd in a Farm about twenty Miles from <HI>Thornton Ca&s;tle. Jerry</HI> was Fifty-five and <HI>Dolly</HI> Twenty-four Years of Age. To compleat their Joy, the <HI>Hero of this Hi&s;tory</HI> &s;tepp'd forth, and was u&s;her'd into the World the 15th Day of <HI>December</HI> 1720, ju&s;t <HI>&s;even Months</HI> after their Nuptials, a fine healthy Boy, and the <HI>very</HI> Picture of <HI>Jerry Connor.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER it was from the <HI>frequent</HI> Vi|&s;its Sir <HI>Roger</HI> paid them, or from &s;ome other Motive, my <HI>Lady Thornton</HI> never re&s;ted till &s;he had per&s;uaded him to remove his Family to <HI>England.</HI> This was a mighty Lo&s;s, and poor <HI>Connor</HI> felt it more and more every Day. They were much in Arrear, and as the Steward could no longer indulge them, they were put to va&s;t Diffi|culties. This &s;hagrin'd Mrs. <HI>Connor,</HI> and her Hu&s;band was &s;ometimes peevi&s;h. Eve|ry Misfortune was imputed to <HI>one</HI> or the
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<HI>other,</HI> con&s;equently many bitter Invectives pa&s;&s;ed between them, and &s;ometimes <HI>Blows.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Connor</HI> generally conquer'd, for an <HI>old Wound</HI> broke out in <HI>his Knee</HI> and lam'd him. The good Woman had always <HI>great Spirits,</HI> which rais'd it&s;elf on certain Occa|&s;ions, to that noble Ardour, which the Vulgar call <HI>Termagant,</HI> in which her <HI>Neigh|bours</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;band</HI> gave her Opportunities to <HI>improve.</HI></P>
<P>AT la&s;t another Wound appear'd in <HI>his Head,</HI> and oblig'd him to have Recour&s;e to the Surgeon of the next Town, though ill able to bear the Expence of, at lea&s;t, <HI>a Shilling</HI> a Day. However, the <HI>Surgeon</HI> was a <HI>&s;kill|ful Man,</HI> and &s;o managed his Patient, that in a Month he brought a Humour into <HI>his Eyes,</HI> and in <HI>&s;ix Weeks</HI> he was <HI>quite Blind.</HI> The <HI>Surgeon</HI> declared his Sorrow for the Accident, but believed, that had it not <HI>providentially</HI> happen'd, it mu&s;t have co&s;t him <HI>his Life.</HI> The Wound at la&s;t heal'd, but <HI>Connor</HI> thought, and his <HI>Wife</HI> &s;aw, they were ruin'd; which the Seizing their two remaining <HI>Cows,</HI> and a Barrel of <HI>Potatoes,</HI> completely fini&s;hed; and next Night the good Woman threw <HI>Jack</HI> on her Back, took her <HI>blind Hu&s;band</HI> by the Hand, and march'd off, with about <HI>&s;ix Shillings,</HI> to &s;eek better Fortune.</P>

<P>THE good People continued their daily Travels, and wander'd through many Counties, and greatly improv'd in the <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> that was to furni&s;h them with Bread; and indeed, every Day produc'd its Supply. Three Months pa&s;t in this Manner, till the <HI>old Man</HI> complain'd of the Fatigue, and mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h'd for a &s;ettled Habitation. They were now in the great Road, and within a few Miles of <HI>Clonmel,</HI> on a pretty Eminence that commanded a good Pro&s;pect. 'Twas agreed to fix here, and lodge about a Quarter of
<PB N="15" REF="22">
a Mile from the Road; where was an <HI>old Hut,</HI> which a few Boughs cover'd well enough for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE Venerablene&s;s of <HI>Jerry</HI>'s Beard, which no <HI>Razor</HI> was &s;uffer'd to vi&s;it, had a very good Effect, and the <HI>tatter'd</HI> Con|dition of <HI>Dolly</HI>'s Cloaths; Her <HI>Hair</HI> hang|ing about her <HI>Eyes,</HI> a <HI>dirty Clout</HI> on her Head, and <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI> almo&s;t of the &s;ame Colour, made her look near <HI>as old</HI> as her <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> and procur'd the Charity of <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;o amply, that they had no Rea&s;on to repent of their Si|tuation.&mdash;In a &s;hort Time, the Hut was better cover'd; and they provided them|&s;elves with <HI>two Cadows,</HI> a <HI>&s;mall Pot, two wooden Platters, two Trenchers, one Knife,</HI> and <HI>two Horn Spoons.</HI> However, this Abode being &s;o di&s;tant from what they might call <HI>their Shop,</HI> made it very in|convenient, and lo&s;t them many <HI>Cu&s;tomers.</HI> This determin'd them to double Diligence, and to &s;ave as much as would build <HI>a Cab|bin</HI> by the Road Side, on the <HI>Common.</HI> A few <HI>Shillings</HI> compleated this Structure, and their Effects were &s;oon removed.</P>
<P>THUS were they fix'd in a more com|fortable Manner than could be imagined, from the Appearance of the <HI>Hovel.</HI> Bu&s;i|ne&s;s went on in a very pro&s;perous Way;
<PB N="16" REF="23">
and, as Money came in, they increas'd their Conveniencies and Uten&s;ils; but every thing was added <HI>externally</HI> that gave an Idea of <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>Wretchedne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;They often drank <HI>Ale,</HI> eat <HI>Bread,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Meat,</HI> which mo&s;t Cottagers in the <HI>King|dom</HI> are utter Strangers to. In &s;hort, they lived as happily as the Impetuo&s;ity of <HI>Dolly's</HI> Temper would admit, which at &s;ome Sea&s;ons vented it&s;elf on <HI>Jerry,</HI> in <HI>old Rogue</HI> and <HI>old Scoundrel,</HI> and &s;uch <HI>affectionate</HI> Epi|thets, which he bore with the Calmne&s;s of a <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> &s;eldom an&s;wering but in <HI>Pro|verbs.</HI></P>

<PB N="18" REF="25">
<HI>primitive Piety,</HI> or at lea&s;t, &s;o much of it, as his <HI>Eyes</HI> would permit, which &s;till &s;park|led, and being fixed on the <HI>beautiful Part</HI> before-mention'd, &s;poke a Language <HI>truly Catholick.</HI></P>
<P>JACK'S Mother was quite confounded at all the&s;e fine Words; and not perfectly un|der&s;tanding <HI>Logical</HI> Di&s;tinctions, was afraid the <HI>Holy Father</HI> was endeavouring to make her Proof again&s;t <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad Fortune,</HI> not again&s;t <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad Morals.

<P>SOME Travellers appearing, and <HI>Jerry</HI> being &s;ummon'd to his Po&s;t, the charitable <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> &s;lipt Sixpence into her Hand, and gave the old Man a Yard of good Tobac|co; &s;o wi&s;hing them <HI>good Luck,</HI> added his <HI>Benediction,</HI> and promis'd to call in his Walks.</P>
<P>IT would be endle&s;s to point out the Vir|tues of this <HI>good Man.</HI> He vi&s;ited frequently, and always left <HI>&s;omething</HI> behind him. He mention'd to <HI>Dolly</HI> the mo&s;t charitable Fa|milies in the Country; and taught <HI>Jerry</HI> how to tell the weary Traveller the <HI>Hour of the Day.</HI> He repair'd the <HI>fir&s;t Hut,</HI> where &s;he always cook'd the Victuals when he <HI>honour'd</HI> them with his Company. He put a Door to it, and &s;ent in good Store of <HI>Whi&s;key</HI> and <HI>Straw,</HI> with <HI>two Cadows.</HI> This &s;erv'd <HI>his Reverence</HI> for a Country Retreat; and an&s;wered every End of a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ional.</HI> His Conver&s;ation was <HI>truly pious,</HI> and his Pains were great to convert <HI>Jerry</HI> to the
<PB N="20" REF="27">
<HI>Bo&s;om of that Church,</HI> out of which there is <HI>no Salvation.</HI> Sometimes, indeed, his <HI>Zeal</HI> was rather too great; for when Mr. <HI>Connor</HI> made &s;trong Objections, he <HI>mo&s;t charitably,</HI> and with a <HI>truly Chri&s;tian Spirit,</HI> hurry'd poor <HI>Jerry</HI>'s Soul <HI>to the Devil and all his Angels;</HI> in which Journey his Wife always added an hearty <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the Age of Five Years, JACK remembers his daily &s;itting on a Ditch with his <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother,</HI> indu&s;triou&s;ly em|ployed in that <HI>mo&s;t antient</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t noble</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Begging.</HI> The Situation was well contriv'd, and three Roads terminated ju&s;t at their Man&s;ion, and, as it were, empty'd them&s;elves into the <HI>great one.</HI> Be|&s;ides the Beauty of the Pro&s;pect, I appre|hend, <HI>his Parents</HI> had &s;ome <HI>Regard</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> to Society; for no Traveller could pa&s;s, but were attack'd with all the <HI>Oratory</HI> in their Power. Without Vanity I may &s;ay, few People of <HI>their Di&s;tinction</HI> enjoy'd that <HI>Talent</HI> to greater Perfection, e&s;pecially Mrs. <HI>Connor.</HI> When &s;he was determin'd to <HI>extract</HI> a <HI>Penny</HI> from a <HI>good Chri&s;tian,</HI> &s;he mounted the Ditch, and with Eyes rais'd to Heaven, and uplifted Hands, &s;he be&s;poke his Favour: She &s;aluted him with every <HI>tender, moving</HI> Expre&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Tear</HI> was ready; and &s;ometimes &s;he pleaded a
<PB N="21" REF="28">
<HI>numerous Family of Orphans,</HI> and &s;ometimes an <HI>antient helple&s;s Hu&s;band.</HI>&mdash; Did his <HI>hard Heart</HI> pa&s;s by <HI>untouch'd,</HI> &s;he followed him with her rais'd Voice, invoking every <HI>Saint</HI> to pro&s;per his Journey, and to commi&s;erate her <HI>wretched Condition.</HI>&mdash;Many a Time, and oft', has &s;he compelled the mo&s;t <HI>obdu|rate Lawyer</HI> or <HI>Par&s;on</HI> to <HI>Rein-back,</HI> and fumble for <HI>Farthings.</HI></P>
<P>JERRY had his Excellence: He was really advanced in Years; was infirm and <HI>blind.</HI> The Lo&s;s of Sight, &s;o dreadful to many, was to them of infinite U&s;e. From this he drew the <HI>Pity</HI> of the <HI>Good-natur'd,</HI> and the <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> of mo&s;t Travellers; but his being an <HI>old Soldier who had &s;erv'd by Sea and Land,</HI> afforded an Addition to his <HI>Revenue;</HI> to which a <HI>red Coat</HI> contributed not a little.</P>
<P>YOUNG as our <HI>Hero</HI> was, his Employ|ment had its U&s;e; for whil&s;t his dear Pa|rents were &s;olacing them&s;elves in <HI>their Ca|&s;tle,</HI> and enjoying the Comforts of <HI>Ale, Tobacco,</HI> and the Conver&s;ation of <HI>Friends,</HI> he was on the Watch for the Approach of Pa&s;&s;engers; when his <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Mother,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>both,</HI> &s;ally'd out, and he al|ways attended to join in the <HI>Cry</HI> and pick up the <HI>Copper</HI> that Humanity threw them.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29">JACK now grew a &s;turdy Fellow, of Six Years old. As his Mother had been &s;o good to teach him to <HI>read,</HI> he was a great Comfort to his <HI>Father,</HI> and entertained him out of <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> which he took particular Care of, ever &s;ince Mrs. <HI>Connor</HI> had &s;old his <HI>Bible.</HI> The Child read &s;o frequently, that at la&s;t he was very <HI>expert,</HI> and began to reli&s;h the Subject.

<PB N="23" REF="30">
<HI>Jack</HI> to <HI>read;</HI> and mutter'd &s;omething of <HI>&s;ending him far enough out of his Reach.</HI></P>
<P><Q>No, <HI>Dolly, &s;aid her Hu&s;band,</HI> you need not do that; for <HI>Father Kelly</HI> and <HI>You</HI> will &s;oon &s;end me to my <HI>long Home!</HI>&mdash;'Tis too good News to be true,&mdash;<HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI>&mdash;Well, well, <HI>reply'd Jerry,</HI> I &s;han't trouble you long;&mdash; you may let me have a little Peace whil&s;t I live.</Q>&mdash;Some Pa&s;&s;engers in|terrupted this Conver&s;ation; and the com|mon Occurrences of the Day, gave <HI>Jerry</HI> &s;ome Re&s;pite till Dinner.&mdash;He &s;aid <HI>Grace</HI> as u&s;ual, but could not eat.

<P>NOTHING remarkable happened in this Journey, but <HI>Jack</HI> complain'd that the <HI>Town</HI> was a great ways off.&mdash;That he wi&s;h'd he was there;&mdash;that he was <HI>Hungry,</HI> or <HI>Dry,</HI> or <HI>Sleepy,</HI> and &s;ome childi&s;h Talk of that Sort, to which the Man gave An&s;wers, and relieved all his Wants.&mdash;Many Days pa&s;&s;ed in &s;mall Journeys, till the Fellow found he was in the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Meath.</HI> He fed the Child as well as he could, and ha|ving got a Woman to wa&s;h his Rags and clean him, march'd on till he came to a large fine Hou&s;e.&mdash;<Q>Now, <HI>Jack, &s;aid he,</HI>

<P>THUS was he fed for a Fortnight, and all Enquiry was made by the Servants about him, but in vain.&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> grew quite well, and mightily pleas'd with his Situation, for <HI>Providence</HI> had directed him to the Hou&s;e of LORD TRUEGOOD, a Nobleman le&s;s remarkable for his <HI>large Fortune,</HI> than his <HI>Humanity,</HI> and exten&s;ive <HI>Charity</HI> to all Mankind.</P>

<P>A SECRET, like many other Di&s;orders, is <HI>Epidemical</HI> and <HI>Contagious,</HI> but in the whole Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ick, none is more <HI>In&s;tant,</HI> or who&s;e Quality is more <HI>Diffu&s;ive.</HI> &mdash;Every Part of <HI>human</HI> Matter is immedi|ately affected, and the fir&s;t Symptom, mo&s;t

<P>AS the Reader mu&s;t re&s;ide with <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Lady Truegood</HI> for &s;ome Time, perhaps they will be pleas'd at being pro|perly acquainted with them.

<P><PB N="47" REF="54">HIS <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> had about Five Thou&s;and a Year in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and about Two Thou|&s;and in <HI>England,</HI> all in his own Power. Her <HI>Lady&s;hip</HI> was the Daughter of Sir <HI>Wil|liam Templeton,</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;hire.</HI> She was Heire&s;s to Two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in that County; and his <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s E&s;tate lay contiguous to it.

Her many Virtues were more admir'd than imitated; and her Per&s;on, tho' not a <HI>Beauty,</HI> was &s;o genteel and <HI>elegantly neat,</HI> that &s;he rais'd <HI>De&s;ire</HI> in every Brea&s;t, and commanded more than common Re&s;pect. They had been well ac|quainted when Children; and from the In|timacy of each Family, a Friend&s;hip, if not &s;omething &s;tronger, in&s;en&s;ibly grew up with them. His Collegiate Studies being over, and his Father dead, he was &s;ent to fini&s;h the Accompli&s;hments of a Gentle|man by <HI>Travel.</HI> In this Time he con&s;tant|ly corre&s;ponded with Mi&s;s <HI>Betty Templeton,</HI> and the mo&s;t agreeable and entertaining Letters pa&s;s'd, greatly to their Satisfaction and mutual Improvement. Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="55">
a Clergyman, and his Lord&s;hip's Tutor and Companion, va&s;tly encourag'd the&s;e good Di&s;po&s;itions in his Pupil, fore&s;eeing the <HI>happy</HI> Con&s;equences that might ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>AT Twenty-four Years of Age, <HI>his Lord|&s;hip</HI> return'd from his Travels, a <HI>truly po|lite,</HI> and <HI>well-bred Man.</HI>&mdash;He found Mi&s;s <HI>Templeton,</HI> now about Nineteen Years of Age, with every Qualification he could wi&s;h in a <HI>Wife.</HI>&mdash;He &s;poke to her, at &s;ome Di&s;tance, on that Head, and found her An&s;wers &s;en&s;ible and ju&s;t, and no-ways again&s;t his Views.&mdash;His <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> then, apply'd to Mrs. <HI>Jordon,</HI> a Widow Lady, and Aunt to Mi&s;s, who had bred her from a Child, and &s;upply'd the Lo&s;s of a Mo|ther. The good Lady was overjoy'd to put her dear Niece into the Hands of a Nobleman of &s;uch Fortune; and who&s;e great Good-nature, and many Virtues, pro|mis'd a Life of real Happine&s;s and Con|tent.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip now paid his Addre&s;&s;es publickly; every one agreeing, they were born for each other.&mdash;A Jointure was &s;oon fix'd on; but the Settling his E&s;tate was a Matter of &s;ome Difficulty, as his Notions on that Head were uncommon.&mdash;He al|ways thought, that the Undutifulne&s;s of
<PB N="49" REF="56">
Children to their Parents, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Elde&s;t Son,</HI> proceeded often from a Know|ledge of the Fortune they were entitled to, at their Father's Decea&s;e.&mdash;His Lord&s;hip convinced the young Lady of the <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> of placing Children out of the Power of Parents, either to <HI>reward</HI> &s;ome for their Goodne&s;s, or <HI>cha&s;ti&s;e</HI> others for their Mi&s;|deeds. At la&s;t he per&s;waded her Guardians, and Four Thou&s;and Pounds a Year was &s;ettled on the I&s;&s;ue of the Marriage, in &s;uch Proportion, as my Lord thought proper to make by Will, or any future Deed or Gift, except an E&s;tate of Five Hundred Pounds a Year, which &s;hould follow the Title: Two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year, and Ten Thou|&s;and Pounds in Money, was &s;ettled on Mi&s;s <HI>Templeton;</HI> and my Lord re&s;erv'd the Re|mainder as a Settlement on any future Wife, or to be di&s;po&s;ed of, as he thought proper. &mdash;The young Lady was &s;o weak, that &s;he ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>Pin,</HI> or <HI>Alimony,</HI> &s;hould not be mentioned in any of the Writ|ings.&mdash;All the&s;e Matters being regularly ad|ju&s;ted, the Day was fix'd, and Mr. <HI>John|&s;ton</HI> joyn'd their Hands, and compleated the Happine&s;s of this truly affectionate Pair.</P>
<P>MY Lord and Lady &s;tay'd above Two Years in <HI>England;</HI> but finding his Pre&s;ence

quite nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to &s;ettle his For|tune, which had &s;omewhat &s;uffer'd by the Death of his Father, and his own long Ab|&s;ence, he ha&s;ten'd over, and determin'd chiefly to re&s;ide there.&mdash;He took with him his two Sons, <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>William,</HI> with my Lady's Aunt, Mrs. <HI>Jordon,</HI> and a nume|rous Retinue of Servants.&mdash;Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> had been already there Twelve Months, and &s;ettled in a good Living, which my Lord had procured him.</P>
<P>BOUNTY-HALL, the Seat of Lord <HI>True-good,</HI> was a regular, well-built Hou&s;e, tho' not altogether in the <HI>Modern Ta&s;te.</HI>&mdash;The Company, to congratulate my Lord and Lady on their &s;afe Arrival, was very nume|rous and very gay. They &s;eem'd free, and of chearful Di&s;po&s;itions, inviting my Lord and Family to their Hou&s;es, in &s;uch an hearty &s;incere Manner, as quite pleas'd and &s;urpriz'd my Lady and Mrs. <HI>Jordon,</HI> who were not a little <HI>prejudiced</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> &mdash;Mrs. <HI>Jordon</HI> could not avoid telling my Lord, &s;he <HI>lik'd them extreamly, but wi&s;h'd they'd &s;peak with another Tone of Voice.</HI>&mdash; My Lord laugh'd, and &s;aid, <Q>I a&s;&s;ure you, one of the Ladies ask'd me, if all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;poke in &s;o &s;trange a Manner as Mrs. <HI>Jordon?</HI> But &s;he added, &s;he believ'd you were a very good Lady, for all that.</Q>
<PB N="51" REF="58">
&mdash;My Lady and her Aunt &s;mil'd, and took this tender Rebuke in the proper Manner; acknowledging, that <HI>Infant Prejudices</HI> were difficult to remove, but hoped, Time would get the better of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>MRS. JORDON took great Pains to re|form the Pronunciation of the People. She made &s;uch Progre&s;s in tran&s;planting the <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Dialect, that on her Return to that County, &s;he was heartily laugh'd at, and by her Friends was con&s;tantly called an <HI>Iri&s;h Bog-Trotter,&mdash;a Brogue-a-neer,&mdash;a Teague,</HI> and &s;undry other <HI>endearing</HI> Names. &mdash;But I mu&s;t follow my Lord.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t Care was to get out of the Hands of the <HI>Lawyers,</HI> for he had three <HI>Chancery Suits:</HI> Two of them he &s;oon fini&s;hed in an amicable Manner, but the Third was &s;o glaring an Affront on his Under&s;tanding and his Right, that he would hear of no Compo&s;ition, le&s;t he might be tax'd with <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> and draw on him&s;elf <HI>others.</HI>&mdash; This determin'd him to pro&s;ecute the Suit with the utmo&s;t Vigour; and the <HI>Expedi|tion</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> was &s;uch, that the Cau&s;e was ripe for an Hearing, ju&s;t as my Lord&mdash; <HI>became a Grandfather.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST his Law Affairs were put in a Channel, he at the &s;ame Time &s;ettled with his different <HI>Receivers,</HI> two of whom he
<PB N="52" REF="59">
di&s;charged, as likewi&s;e his <HI>Auditor,</HI> taking that Branch into his own Management. He oblig'd his Receivers to return him Monthly Ab&s;tracts of their Receipts and Payments, by which he was enabled to &s;ettle each Tenant's Account, and at <HI>one View,</HI> knew their Arrear, and gave Orders for <HI>Severity</HI> or <HI>Indulgence,</HI> as the Circum|&s;tances required.</P>
<P>As my Lord's chief Re&s;idence was in the Country, he &s;aw, with real Unea&s;ine&s;s, the <HI>wretched Condition</HI> of the poor Inhabitants. Their <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Sloth,</HI> with the Swarms of <HI>ignorant Prie&s;ts,</HI> and the Treatment of <HI>&s;ome Landlords,</HI> kept them in a con&s;tant <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> Situation, and even depriv'd them of &s;ufficient Spirits to <HI>wi&s;h</HI> a Change of Condition. My Lord clearly &s;aw, that &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions could never improve the Face of the Country. He con&s;idered, that the People, however <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> were by Nature, &s;trong; and, when &s;et on by Example and Encouragement, were not the <HI>lea&s;t Docile</HI> of all Nations. The&s;e Sort of Reflections, as a faithful and good Subject, engro&s;&s;ed his whole Thoughts. He knew, that the Strength of the Crown, was in the Number of faithful Inhabitants; and, to reclaim tho&s;e who were otherwi&s;e, was a

Duty worthy the Attention of every Man who lov'd the <HI>King</HI> or his <HI>own Happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>AT a Meeting of the Ju&s;tices of the Peace for the County, his Lord&s;hip very patheti|cally laid before them, what <HI>Popery</HI> was productive of, in a <HI>Prote&s;tant Government;</HI> or, as it is elegantly expre&s;s'd by the bright|e&s;t Genius of the Age,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>EARL</HI> of <HI>CHESTERFIELD'S</HI> Speech to the <HI>PARLIAMENT</HI> of <HI>IRELAND.</HI></NOTE> <Q>That the &s;pecula|tive Errors <HI>(of POPERY)</HI> would only de|&s;erve Pity, if their pernicious Influence upon <HI>CIVIL SOCIETY</HI> did not both <HI>REQUIRE</HI> and <HI>AUTHORIZE</HI> Re&s;traint.</Q> That the <HI>Laws</HI> again&s;t <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> tho' &s;evere in the Let|ter, and tho' mo&s;tly taken from the <HI>Edicts of France</HI> again&s;t <HI>Hugonots,</HI> but greatly &s;often'd, were connived at, and, in a great Mea&s;ure, made u&s;ele&s;s.&mdash;That the Condi|tion of the poorer Sort in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was a <HI>Scandal</HI> to a Nation who piqued them&s;elves at being <HI>Polite</HI> and <HI>Humane,</HI> and almo&s;t compell'd the <HI>few Strangers</HI> who vi&s;ited the Country, to imagine they were rather with the Natives of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> than in a <HI>civilized Kingdom.</HI>&mdash;That as natural Ju&s;tice and Tenderne&s;s obliged us to in|dulge them with a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> in each Pari&s;h; yet Ju&s;tice and Tenderne&s;s to our&s;elves,

<P>THAT the poorer Sort might not want Examples of Indu&s;try to &s;pur them on, my Lord annually &s;ettled two or three poor <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Families on the Home E&s;tate.

<P>MY Lord made Regulations as he &s;aw convenient.

<P>THOUGH his Lord&s;hip had began and forwarded the&s;e <HI>great Works,</HI> he attended the <HI>Briti&s;h Parliament</HI> three Win|ters, as a Member of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.

<P>His Son HENRY was now about Five, WILLIAM, Four, and his Daughter HAR|RIOT, Three Years of Age. The&s;e began to demand his particular Attention. Her Lady&s;hip was an uncommon Mother, for &s;he had not only taught them what their
<PB N="59" REF="66">
Age was capable of; but had mo&s;t prudent|ly prevented their being taught &s;undry bad Habits, which might never be thoroughly era&s;ed. Scarcely were any of her Children able to <HI>walk,</HI> when &s;he took Opportunities of &s;ending them into the next Room at Night <HI>without a Candle;</HI> and as they grew up, &s;he found Rea&s;ons to oblige them to go over the <HI>whole Hou&s;e</HI> in the &s;ame Man|ner, neither did &s;he ever permit a <HI>Servant</HI> to &s;tay with them, or a Candle to burn in the Room, when they were put to Bed. No <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> or <HI>Dome&s;tick,</HI> dur&s;t venture to mention a &s;ingle <HI>Word,</HI> or <HI>idle Story</HI> that could in&s;pire <HI>Fear</HI> into the Minds of the Children, except they cho&s;e their immedi|ate Di&s;charge, which happened twice or thrice.&mdash;By this Method they had no No|tion of <HI>imaginary Dangers,</HI> which &s;aved them many unea&s;y Hours in their Lives, which others feel for Want of &s;uch a <HI>Man|agement.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR little Learning was not inculcated by the common Means of <HI>Obligation</HI> and <HI>Duty.</HI> If my Lord gave them Halfpence, and they li&s;ten'd to the Story of a <HI>poor Per&s;on,</HI> and relieved him, he was in great Delight.&mdash;When he had mentioned all the Ble&s;&s;ings attending a <HI>Charitable</HI> and <HI>Com|pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Temper; he'd turn to my Lady,

On the&s;e Occa&s;ions, the poor Delinquent was oblig'd to make his Peace, and enter into Grace, by <HI>Prayer, Repentance,</HI> and double Diligence; yet &s;till, this Matter was &s;o contrived, that no <HI>Jea|lou&s;y</HI> could ari&s;e among&s;t them. The <HI>Good</HI> were &s;uffered to pity the <HI>Faulty,</HI> and inter|cede for them; and, after the nece&s;&s;ary Dif|ficulties, always &s;ucceeded.

my Lord.&mdash;As the little ones were, what is commonly call'd, <HI>fine Children,</HI> Care was taken to prevent their having <HI>too good</HI> an Opinion of their <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI>&mdash;The Servants had particular In&s;tructions on that Head; nor could they, without greatly di&s;obliging my Lord, prai&s;e a Child for its beautiful Face, Skin, or the like.

<P>WHEN the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Book, which was always a voluntary Duty, or rather a Plea&s;ure, was over, they were indulged in every Amu&s;ement, and not kept up in <HI>warm Rooms,</HI> to weaken their <HI>Sinews</HI> and enfeeble their <HI>Con&s;titutions.</HI> The Boys were permitted to ramble in the Fields with a careful Servant or two, and u&s;e as much <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> as they plea&s;ed, and their being <HI>dirty</HI> or <HI>wet</HI> on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, was never counted a Fault.&mdash;Sometimes my Lord and Lady were va&s;tly amus'd, in entering into the <HI>Spirit</HI> of their Plays, and my Lord tumbled about the Room and join'd in their Mirth and Pa&s;time. By this Means, the Children were never happier than when with them. They &s;eem'd like <HI>Companions</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> to each other; and, as they had no Secrets to hide, their Behaviour

was <HI>chearful</HI> and without <HI>Re&s;traint.</HI> If &s;ome|times, they were timorous, it was the Con|&s;equence of Love and Affection, and Fear of di&s;obliging.</P>
<P>AT their Meals my Lord and Lady in|&s;tructed them without their perceiving their main De&s;ign; for they never directly ap|plied to any one, or gave them Directions or Advice to <HI>do this,</HI> or <HI>avoid that.</HI>&mdash;Their Coun&s;el was always given <HI>obliquely,</HI> by prai&s;ing &s;uch a Gentleman's Son, <Q>who was &s;o <HI>extreamly good;</HI> that, though no more than Five Years old, he read ex|ceedingly well, had all the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> by heart, and wanted much to learn to <HI>Write.</HI></Q> Then my Lord would add, <Q>I have en|treated his Father to <HI>indulge</HI> the Child, and have prevail'd.'&mdash;'I told you, <HI>re|ply'd my Lady,</HI> that <HI>that Boy</HI> would do well, for I have always found him fond of his <HI>Book.</HI></Q> &mdash;Sometimes my Lord much pity'd a Gentleman, who had &s;pent a great deal of Money on his Son's Edu|cation.

<P>NOT a Word of the&s;e Sort of In&s;inua|tions was lo&s;t to the Children. Their little Thoughts were &s;et to work, and they never failed making the Application.

On the&s;e and every other Occa&s;ion, they were &s;poken to by their Pa|rents and Tutor in <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>elegant En|gli&s;h,</HI> and were &s;et right if their An&s;wers were not in the be&s;t Terms.</P>
<P>A &s;evere Reprimand was &s;carcely ever u&s;ed, but when they were guilty of &s;ome <HI>Act,</HI> that had the lea&s;t Tendency to <HI>Cruelty</HI> or <HI>Ill-nature.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Torturing a Fly</HI> or a <HI>Sparrow</HI>&mdash;a <HI>pert An&s;wer</HI> to a poor Per&s;on or a Servant, were <HI>Crimes,</HI> that brought a <HI>Rebuke</HI> and a <HI>Le&s;&s;on</HI> that ended in <HI>Tears,</HI> and an Acknowledgment of the Fault; but if they told an <HI>Untruth,</HI> or <HI>prevaricated</HI> on any Examination, no <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> nor all the Promi&s;es they could make, were capable to prevent a <HI>Cha&s;ti&s;ement</HI> that made the Guilty and Innocent <HI>tremble.</HI> The Maxim

<P>WITH regard to their <HI>Servants,</HI> they were look'd on, almo&s;t in the Light of <HI>Children,</HI> and had a natural Right to <HI>Pro|tection</HI> and <HI>Advice.</HI> As <HI>Servants,</HI> they were obliged to a Strictne&s;s in their <HI>Duty,</HI> but as <HI>Men,</HI> they were treated with that <HI>Huma|nity</HI> and <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> every Creature is intitled to. They <HI>obey'd</HI> their Orders with <HI>Alacrity</HI> and <HI>Chearfulne&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e they were never given with <HI>Haughtine&s;s,</HI> or in an <HI>angry</HI> Manner.</P>
<P>FOR a Nobleman, he had many uncom|mon and &s;ingular Notions. He had <HI>Prayers</HI> every Morning and Night, and all the Fa|mily a&s;&s;i&s;ted with great Decency. His Lord&s;hip thought, that the Duties of <HI>Re|ligion,</HI> were of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to <HI>Society,</HI> and the only Security for the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Confidence</HI> of Man to Man.&mdash;He was &s;urprized, how People could, with Ju&s;tice, complain of the <HI>Theft, Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> and other Immoralities of their <HI>Servants,</HI> when they not only took no Care to per&s;uade them of the Odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch Practices, by ordering them to attend the Service of

the <HI>Church,</HI> but too frequently gave Ex|amples of <HI>the&s;e Vices</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THOUGH I have mentioned <HI>Theft</HI> a|mong&s;t the Vices of Gentlemen, &s;urely tho&s;e who run in <HI>Debt</HI> to Trade&s;men, and &s;uffer them to wa&s;te their <HI>Time</HI> in vain En|quiries after ther <HI>Property,</HI> commit a <HI>Rob|bery</HI> of the blacke&s;t Kind, and de&s;erve equal Puni&s;hment with tho&s;e Wretches, who have openly ventur'd their Lives to maintain their Extravagancies, and &s;ome|times to &s;atisfy their <HI>real</HI> Wants.</P>
<P>THIS Sort of Conduct was unknown in the Family, where, on the Delivery of any Commodity, <HI>the Value</HI> was in&s;tantly paid. By this Means he was better &s;erv'd, le&s;s impos'd on, and bought cheaper than mo&s;t of his Neighbours. Few Things &s;urpriz'd him more, than how a Man can live and pretend to <HI>any Degree</HI> of Comfort or Con|tent, when <HI>indebted</HI> to Numbers, and for large Sums.&mdash;He imagined that the many Examples of the <HI>fatal</HI> Con&s;equence of &s;uch ab&s;urd Management, ought to per&s;uade them into an oppo&s;ite Behaviour; but the Want of Thought or proper Reflection, plung'd them into Extravagance, then into Mortgages, Law-Suits, and Di&s;credit.&mdash;If po&s;&s;ible, they avail them&s;elves of an infa|mous and &s;candalous Practice,

Still the Evils accumulate, and often end in a <HI>Gaol,</HI> in the <HI>Ruin</HI> of their Families, and the Families of many of their <HI>Cre|ditors.</HI></P>
<P>MY Lord was not only punctual and ex|act in his Dealings, but every one under him was almo&s;t compell'd to the like Con|duct, for they knew his being a <HI>Nobleman</HI> gave them no <HI>Authority</HI> to commit, nor would protect them from the <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> due to an <HI>illegal</HI> or <HI>unju&s;t</HI> Action.</P>
<P>METHOD makes &s;eeming Difficulties quite ea&s;y, and a prudent Conduct brings that Peace and Satisfaction of Mind, which we term <HI>Happine&s;s.</HI> His Lord&s;hip's Feli|city was not merely confin'd to the Pro&s;pect of his own regular Family; for he had the Plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that many of his Neighbours adopted &s;ome of his Rules, and that the <HI>poorer Sort</HI> began to practice a few. &mdash;If my Lord and his whole Family were con&s;tant at <HI>Church,</HI> the Gentry round, cea|&s;ed to think it <HI>ungenteel,</HI> and were as con|&s;tant as they.&mdash;If my Lord made <HI>Re&s;pon&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Service,</HI> or &s;ung <HI>P&s;alms</HI> with an au|dible Voice, and was really <HI>intent</HI> on the <HI>Duties</HI> of the Place, the re&s;t of the Con|gregation were brought to believe, that their a&s;&s;embling was for other Purpo&s;es

than &s;hewing their <HI>Finery, Gigling, Laugh|ing, Bowing,</HI> and the like.

<P>AS my Lord and Lady were ble&s;&s;ed with great Good-nature and Under&s;tanding, &s;o were they happy in a &s;incere and mutual Affection. The World was not convinc'd of this from a <HI>fooli&s;h idle Fondne&s;s,</HI> when in Company; but by their <HI>Chearfulne&s;s, good Humour</HI> and <HI>Complacency</HI> to each other, and all pre&s;ent.&mdash;MY Lord knew of what <HI>Hu|man Nature</HI> is compounded, and that, to keep up this Harmony, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> a little Management was &s;ome|times nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>MRS. LONG found the Coat and other Things, fitted <HI>Jack</HI> very well, and had dre&s;s'd him with great Neatne&s;s. On his Arrival at my Lord's, the whole Fami|ly admir'd his <HI>Strength</HI> and his exact <HI>Make,</HI> but he &s;eem'd more <HI>aukward</HI> than before, and was very unea&s;y with his Shoes. Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> provided him with &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries, and employ'd him in attending my Lord's Sons in their Amu&s;ements, and in cleaning their Shoes, and bru&s;hing their Coats. At lei&s;ure Times he heard him read in the <HI>Bible,</HI> or his own Book, and my Lord and Lady often did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN &s;ix Months the Boy was quite chang'd. The chearful and happy Di&s;po&s;ition in|dulg'd him by Nature, &s;hew'd it&s;elf on a
<PB N="86" REF="93">
thou&s;and Occa&s;ions; in&s;omuch, that he be|came a general Favourite, and was &s;en&s;ible of his Happine&s;s. Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> from Time to Time gave him &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> as &s;uited his Age, and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> taught him his <HI>Prayers, Catechi&s;m,</HI> and other Matters, equal with my Lord's Children.</P>
<P>ONE Day, as Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> was writing in his Office, <HI>Jack</HI> approach'd him, and blu&s;h|ing, but with a mode&s;t Smile, look'd up, and &s;eem'd as if he had a Favour to ask. &mdash;'Well <HI>Jack, &s;aid the good Man,</HI> d'ye want another Book.'&mdash;'No indeed, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Child,</HI> I don't want a Book.' &mdash;'Why, you Rogue, <HI>&s;aid Kindly,</HI> I hope you are not tir'd of Reading?' 'Yes in|deed, Sir, <HI>&s;aid Jack.</HI>' 'O ho, <HI>&s;aid the old Man,</HI> very well, &s;ince you will not read, and be a good Boy, I &s;hall get you a Leather Coat and Cap, and you &s;hall be a Po&s;tillion, and lie with the Hor&s;es.' <HI>Jack</HI>'s Countenance chang'd, his Eyes &s;well'd, and he bur&s;t into a violent Fit of Crying.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> was a long Time be|fore he could dry his Tears, or get him to &s;peak and explain what he wanted.&mdash;<Q>Sir, <HI>&s;aid Jack at la&s;t,</HI> indeed and indeed, I am not tir'd of Reading, for if you plea&s;e, I would be very good, and write as you
<PB N="87" REF="94">
do, if you'd give me Pens and Paper.</Q> &mdash;The Tenderne&s;s of the old Gentleman was touch'd at the Child's Reque&s;t.&mdash;<Q>Yes, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my dear <HI>Jack,</HI> you &s;hall have Pens and Paper, and I will get you a little Desk in the Office, and teach you to write my&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> was quite delighted, and the Novelty of the Employment di|verted and plea&s;ed Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> particularly as his Pupil was &s;o apt a Scholar, that in eigh|teen Months he wrote a very good Hand, and perfectly under&s;tood the four fir&s;t Rules of Arithmetick.</P>
<P>HE was now about Ten Years of Age, and &s;eem'd to have a Faculty in learning whatever he undertook. In the Plays of Children he was dexterous, and in the little Occupations of the Family, he was Hand|dy and Neat. He had a certain Manner of doing Things, that <HI>Nature</HI> alone can give, and what &s;ome can only <HI>imitate,</HI> even by <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Pains.</HI> Another natural Gift began at this Time to be remarkable, for he had a fine Voice, and greatly diverted the Maids with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Songs. Some were of Humour, and requir'd a proper Ma|nagement of Voice and Words to keep up the Drollery. This he was a perfect Ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="95">The Boys were one Morning at Play in the Fields, and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock,</HI> who common|ly attended them, was, by Accident, at a good Di&s;tance. Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> had &s;ome Words, and <HI>Harry</HI> gave him a Blow on the Face. <HI>Jack</HI> greatly re&s;ented this, and told him, if he was not my Lord's Son, he'd beat him heartily. <HI>Harry,</HI> fir'd at the Rebuke and Menace, pull'd off his Coat, and flew at him like a little Tiger. <HI>Jack</HI> defended him&s;elf without returning a Stroke, though his Hair was almo&s;t torn off his Head. At la&s;t he receiv'd a violent Cut which &s;tunn'd him, and made his No&s;e bleed. He then cried out mo&s;t bitterly, and run directly Home. The Tutor heard his Cries, and &s;aw him running, and join|ing the Boys, Ma&s;ter <HI>Billy</HI> told him the real Truth. As <HI>Jack</HI> was entering the Hou&s;e, my Lord &s;aw him from a Window in his Study, and order'd a Servant to bring him up. With &s;ome Difficulty he got the Story out of him, and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> and the two Boys entering with my Lady, my Lord was confirm'd in the Truth of what he &s;aid, and looking very <HI>&s;erious,</HI> and in great <HI>Concern,</HI> &s;at down and took up his Book.</P>
<P>'I AM, <HI>&s;aid my Lady,</HI> quite &s;urpriz'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd, that <HI>Harry</HI> could behave
<PB N="89" REF="96">
in &s;o brutal a Manner to a poor Boy that loves him.&mdash; Come hither <HI>Jack, &s;aid &s;he,</HI> &mdash;Do you think you could beat <HI>Harry,</HI> if you were to box and fight fairly?' 'Yes indeed, plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> for Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> knows I'm &s;tronger than him.'&mdash;'Very well, <HI>reply'd my Lady,</HI> I believe what you &s;ay, and now remem|ber, you have my Lord's Leave and mine, to beat him &s;oundly whenever he &s;trikes you again.'&mdash;Then turning to a Servant, order'd <HI>Jack</HI> to be taken down and clean'd.&mdash; Poor <HI>Harry</HI> was in great Tribu|lation; but when my Lady, very gravely, directed <HI>him to go to the Kitchen, and dine with the Servants,</HI> he cry'd mo&s;t dreadfully. &mdash;<Q>Why, Sir, <HI>&s;aid my Lady,</HI> you are fit for no other Company; for, when a young Gentlemen will fight with his Servant, does he not make him his equal? But I &s;uppo&s;e you think you may do what you plea&s;e with <HI>Jack;</HI> but to convince you, Sir, you are no better than him, except you behave better, you &s;hall wear <HI>his Cloaths,</HI> and he <HI>yours,</HI> and then I believe every Stranger will take him for <HI>Ma&s;ter Harry,</HI> and you for <HI>Jack Connor.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HARRY begg'd and intreated, and gave many Promi&s;es of never doing the like a|gain.&mdash;<Q>You &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid my Lady,</HI> when one
<PB N="90" REF="97">
does a naughty Thing, no-body &s;peaks in our Favour. I cannot forgive you, ex|cept my Lord does.</Q>&mdash;Then turning a|bout, 'Will your Lord&s;hip, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> par|don <HI>Harry</HI> this one Fault, he promi&s;es, and is penitent.'&mdash;'My Dear, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> what can I do in the Affair? If Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> was a Gentleman, and had beaten a Servant of mine, I &s;hould cer|tainly re&s;ent the Affront, except he begg'd, and obtain'd my Servant's Pardon.'&mdash; That's true indeed, <HI>&s;aid my Lady,</HI> &s;o, my dear <HI>Billy,</HI> call up <HI>Jack,</HI> and I am &s;ure <HI>Harry</HI> will beg his Pardon very &s;incerely.' &mdash;Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock,</HI> who knew his Time, began now to intercede for Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd my Lord he never knew him do a Thing of that Sort, or put him&s;elf into &s;o violent a Pa&s;&s;ion before; that, as it was the <HI>fir&s;t Fault,</HI> he begg'd my Lord to forgive him, and could almo&s;t promi&s;e it would be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>MY Lord &s;hak'd his Head, and the two Boys entering, my Lady &s;poke to <HI>Harry,</HI> who immediately went and ki&s;s'd <HI>Jack,</HI> and very heartily ask'd his Pardon. <HI>Jack</HI> blu&s;h'd, but with a Smile bow'd, and ki&s;s'd him again.&mdash;<HI>Harry</HI> then went to my Lord, and on his Knees begg'd his Forgivene&s;s. My Lord rais'd him, &s;aying, <Q>I forgive
<PB N="91" REF="98">
you, my Dear, this Fault, &s;ince you are &s;orry for committing it, but depend on <HI>your Honour,</HI> that you will keep your Word, and never vex your Papa again. Now go and beg my Lady's Pardon, for you have greatly offended and fretted her.</Q> &mdash;My Lady took him in her Arms, and the Affair ended much to the Satisfaction of all Parties.</P>
<P>TWO Days after, the three Boys, the Chaplain, and a Servant with a Gun, went in the Morning to walk as u&s;ual. A &s;mall Rivulet run by one of the Fields, which they generally cro&s;s'd by the Help of large Stones, but an Abundance of Rain having fallen, it was rais'd above four Feet, and very rapid. This &s;topp'd their Progre&s;s; but, as they mounted the Brook to find an|other <HI>Pa&s;&s;age, Harry</HI> &s;aw a <HI>Jack-daw</HI> in a Tree on the oppo&s;ite Side, and the Boys begg'd the Servant to fire at it, and they mounted the Ditch to &s;ee it fall. <HI>Jack</HI> went a little lower to get a convenient Stand, but &s;carcely had he been there a Moment, when, the Earth breaking under <HI>Harry</HI>'s Feet, he fell into the River.&mdash;His Brother &s;hriek'd, but <HI>Jack</HI> in&s;tantly took Hold of a Bough of a Tree that fell near the Water, and &s;tretching out as far as he was able, caught <HI>Harry</HI> by the Hair, ju&s;t as he ro&s;e, having
<PB N="92" REF="99">
been carryed by the Stream about ten Yards, and held him fa&s;t.&mdash;<HI>Billy</HI> roar'd and &s;tamp'd, and the poor Par&s;on and Servant were frighten'd almo&s;t into <HI>Stupidity,</HI> till <HI>Jack</HI> call'd out <HI>here&mdash;here.</HI>&mdash;They got to him ju&s;t in Time, for his whole Weight re&s;ting on his left Arm, his <HI>little</HI> Force was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted.&mdash;<HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> and the Servant jump'd in directly, and re&s;cu'd <HI>Harry;</HI> but, not immediately attending to the Care of <HI>Jack,</HI> the poor Boy could not retire, but fell in between them. However, they divided their Labour, and brought the Children &s;afely out.</P>
<P>JACK had only got a Ducking, but <HI>Harry</HI> was &s;ome Time before he could &s;peak, but being laid on the Gra&s;s, he &s;oon recovered. The Tenderne&s;s of the Boys is not to be expre&s;s'd; they ki&s;s'd him a thou&s;and Times, and even cry'd with Joy. Mr. <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ock,</HI> fearing they might catch Cold, walk'd pretty &s;martly towards the Hou&s;e, near which they met my Lord, looking over &s;ome Improvements. He was greatly &s;ur|priz'd at the Condition they were all in, but much more &s;o, when the Chaplain told him of the Accident, and particularly of <HI>Jack</HI>'s ready Thought. My Lord was much mov'd, and mo&s;t affectionately embracing the Children, carry'd them to my Lady,
<PB N="93" REF="100">
who waited their coming in to Breakfa&s;t. &mdash;As my Lord told her the Story, <HI>Love, Tenderne&s;s, Surpri&s;e</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> were vi&s;ible in her Countenance. Her Heart &s;eemed ready to leap from its Habitation, and the <HI>whole Mother</HI> ru&s;hing violently on her Spi|rits, &s;he &s;eiz'd <HI>Harry</HI> in her Arms, and would have fall'n with him, had not my Lord and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> &s;upported her to her Chair, where &s;he did not recover till her Tears were &s;uffer'd to come to her A&s;&s;i&s;|tance.</P>
<P>THE Boys were put in warm Beds, and the Chaplain was advis'd to change his Cloaths. My Lord and the Women &s;tayed with my Lady, and indeed &s;he had great Occa&s;ion for them.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> had been ab&s;ent on Bu&s;ine&s;s; but when he return'd, and heard of the Affair, he trembled ex|ce&s;&s;ively; but Joy &s;ucceeding, he ran to my Lord, and Lady, then to the two Boys, whom he almo&s;t &s;mother'd with Care&s;&s;es, then to the Chaplain, and then to my Lord again. In a Word, the <HI>poor Man</HI> could think and &s;peak of Nothing el&s;e, and even of that not very di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>THE Hurry of the Family ceas'd by De|grees, and all Matters were &s;et right by Dinner Time, and <HI>Jack</HI> took his Place be|hind the Boys, whom he always waited on.
<PB N="94" REF="101">
A Neighbouring Gentleman hearing of the Accident, came to felicitate my Lord on Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI>'s providential E&s;cape.&mdash;At Dinner it was the particular Conver&s;ation, and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> was compell'd to repeat the Morning Adventure with all its Cir|cum&s;tances, which often oblig'd <HI>Jack</HI> to blu&s;h and hold down his Head.&mdash;My Lord bid him never to be a&s;hamed at doing Good, and the Gentleman was very lavi&s;h of his Prai&s;es.&mdash;My Lady look'd at Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> and hinting at the Quarrel, &s;aid,&mdash;<Q>We may plainly &s;ee how much it is our <HI>In|tere&s;t</HI> to be <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Friendly</HI> to, and a|void giving Offence to the <HI>poore&s;t Crea|ture,</HI> &s;ince every Man, however <HI>low</HI> or <HI>mean,</HI> may, if he plea&s;es, be of <HI>great U&s;e,</HI> or do an irreparable <HI>Injury</HI> to the <HI>Greate&s;t.</HI> Let what will be our Situations, we are born to <HI>help</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> each other, accord|ing to our Power and Abilities, and he, who does it not, de&s;troys the End of his Creation.&mdash;This, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> is a plain Truth, and I hope you and your Brother will re|member and practi&s;e it, as long as you live.</Q></P>
<P>THUS, out of every Accident, or the mo&s;t common Occurences, did the&s;e <HI>wi&s;e Parents</HI> inculcate <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Humanity</HI> in the Minds of their Children, and gave them
<PB N="95" REF="102">
a moral Certainty of their being hereafter <HI>happy</HI> in them&s;elves, and of making others <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Evening the Gentleman took his Leave, and calling <HI>Jack,</HI> ki&s;s'd him and put a Crown in his Hand, which he imme|diately depo&s;ited with Mr. <HI>Kindly.</HI> My Lord gave the Servant which had been with the Children, a Farm worth Ten Pounds a Year. Many poor neighbouring Families felt, on this Occa&s;ion, his Goodne&s;s and Liberality, and he added ten Children more to the Cha|rity Scheme before-mentioned. The Chap|lain was not forgot in my Lord's Thoughts, and my Lady order'd <HI>Jack</HI> new Cloaths from Head to Foot.</P>
<P>AS the Family was extremely belov'd, no Wonder if all the Gentlemen round con|tinued for &s;ome Time to vi&s;it and congra|tulate them on their good Fortune. Scarce|ly one quitted <HI>Bounty-Hall,</HI> without a Mark of Regard for <HI>Jack.</HI> The&s;e he always con|&s;ign'd to Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> &s;o that his Riches at la&s;t amounted to the mighty Sum of <HI>Ten Pounds.</HI></P>

<P>PERHAPS my merry Readers are extremely angry at being &s;o long de|tain'd in Company with <HI>Boys,</HI> whil&s;t others of a more &s;erious Turn are pleas'd with the Opening of the Heart, and the gradual In|crea&s;e of Knowledge in the Minds of Chil|dren.

<P>MISS BETTY KINDLY, now turn'd of Twenty, was a mo&s;t agreeable Girl, with good Sen&s;e and good Humour. Mr. <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ock</HI> had a &s;mall paternal Fortune, a good Allowance from my Lord, and forty Pounds

a Year, for officiating for the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, who was about Four&s;core Years of Age.

Occa&s;ion. My Lady had made her a Pre|&s;ent of genteel <HI>plain Cloaths;</HI> and her good Complexion Shape and Size, made her a very de&s;irable Object. Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> look'd, and &s;eem'd to think her a Subject <HI>worth handling.</HI>&mdash;When the Ceremony, and the u&s;ual Compliments were over, my Lord declar'd his Intention of giving the Pari&s;h to Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock,</HI> on the Death of Doctor <HI>Canter.</HI>&mdash;This was a <HI>Comment</HI> on the <HI>Text,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> had not known before; and, as it perfectly agreed with his Way of Thinking, he look'd on the <HI>Author</HI> as a very <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e</HI> Man.&mdash;The Truth is, he was &s;o &s;truck with my Lord's Bounty, that neither he nor his Bride could return their Thank but by their humble Obei|&s;ances.</P>
<P>MY Lord had &s;till in Re&s;erve what was to complete the Reward of Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s Fidelity.&mdash;He fir&s;t be&s;tow'd many Com|pliments on him before all the Company, and then added, &mdash;<Q>When my Boys are &s;ettled at Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s School, my La|dy and I purpo&s;e &s;taying for &s;ome Time in <HI>England.</HI> You will then, Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> be &s;o good to audit the Accounts of my Receivers, and take the Charge and Ma|nagement of my <HI>Charity Children.</HI> You and the young Couple mu&s;t keep this

<P>A PROFOUND Silence en&s;u'd, till the <HI>old Man,</HI> finding his Tongue, he pour'd out whatever his <HI>grateful</HI> Heart &s;ugge&s;ted, and ending in mo&s;t fervent Prayers, retir'd in Ha&s;te, to give his Tears of Joy full Scope. &mdash;At Dinner he was pretty chearful; and <HI>Mirth, Good-humour</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> admir'd <HI>Bounty-Hall,</HI> and re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>As I am call'd another Way, it cannot be expected I &s;hould wait on this Company the whole Evening, much le&s;s pretend to conduct Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> and his <HI>Bride</HI> to that <HI>Theatre,</HI> where we are &s;uffer'd to &s;ee the <HI>Actors,</HI> but by the Reflection of <HI>Fancy.</HI>&mdash; Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that the young Lady was next Morning Mrs. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock.</HI></P>

<P>'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to inform my Readers, that Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> who I am now going to vi&s;it, is the <HI>Clergyman</HI> that was a Compa|nion to my Lord in his Travels.&mdash;During their Stay at <HI>Paris,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> became acquainted with Madam <HI>Bonfoy,</HI> the Widow of a Captain who had been kill'd in the Service. She had &s;ollicited for a Pen&s;ion; but, being known to be a <HI>Hugonot,</HI> could never obtain it. As &s;he had two thou&s;and Livres a Year on the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> and the Intere&s;t of &s;ome Money, &s;he kept genteel Apartments, and liv'd in a very decent Manner with her <HI>Niece,</HI> who was about four Years old.</P>
<P>THE Temper of Madam <HI>Bonfoy</HI> was &s;o like Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s, an Inclination for each other en&s;u'd, which <HI>ended,</HI> or rather <HI>increa&s;|ed,</HI> in Matrimony.&mdash;My Lord got him a good Living in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but afterwards advis'd him to exchange for one of le&s;s Value near <HI>Portarlington,</HI> in the <HI>King's County,</HI> inhabited mo&s;tly by <HI>French Prote&s;tants,</HI> and where little of any other Language was &s;poken. My Lord gave
<PB N="105" REF="112">
him the Plan of a <HI>School,</HI> which, by Mr. and Mrs. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s good Management, could not fail of being extremely advanta|geous to them. Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> had now been in that Situation near four Years, and met with great Approbation, as he had Talents peculiar to that Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>MASTER <HI>Harry</HI> was now twelve Years of Age, and all Things were preparing for the Journey of the three Boys. Every one in the Family began to dread the Lo&s;s of &s;uch Children, who, by a thou&s;and little Pranks, were extremely dear to them. Mi&s;s <HI>Harriot</HI> began to pine and cry, that &s;he was to lo&s;e her Brothers, and her Favou|rite <HI>little Jack.</HI> In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the &s;ilent Grief that reign'd in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. KINDLY took up whole Days in preaching to <HI>Jack,</HI> and giving him good Advice.&mdash;<Q>Perhaps, my dear Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I may never &s;ee you again; if &s;o, mind my Words, and I &s;hall be always pre&s;ent with you, and &s;hield you from tho&s;e E|vils the World is full of. If you <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> them, depend upon it, <HI>Cala|mity</HI> and <HI>Misfortunes</HI> will attend you.

<P>THE Coach and Servants were prepared, and the young Travellers were to &s;et out next Morning with my Lord and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ock.</HI> Her Lady&s;hip being with Child, pre|vented her being of the Party.</P>
<P>THE Morning came, and the Hor&s;es were ordered to be put too.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> took <HI>Jack</HI> in his Hand to the Office, and, &s;hewing him his little Effects in a &s;mall Trunk he had provided, put therein a Pur&s;e, &s;aying,&mdash;<Q><HI>Jack,</HI> here is all your Money, with &s;ome Intere&s;t, amounting to <HI>Fifteen</HI> Guineas.

Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s Wai&s;t, a&s;&s;ur'd him, he would always remember the <HI>Drawer</HI> and the <HI>Dog-Kennel.</HI></P>
<P>THEY now join'd the Children, whom they found in Tears, having ju&s;t quitted her Lady&s;hip. <HI>Jack</HI> was &s;ent in by my Lord, and on his Knees, mo&s;t humbly thank'd her Lady&s;hip for all her Goodne&s;s to him.&mdash;The parting with her Sons made her &s;carcely able to &s;peak, but &s;he bid him mind his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>&s;erve God.</HI> &mdash;She could utter no more, but with a tender Embrace let him depart.</P>
<P>THE Servants had their Turn, and the Boys were almo&s;t hugg'd to Death.&mdash;With great Difficulty they quitted this moving Scene, and the Coach driving off, were followed by the Prayers and Ble&s;&s;ings of a thou&s;and of the poor Inhabitants.</P>

<P>THE Occurrences on the Road are not worth mentioning; but my Lord and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> gave the Lads a good Impre&s;|&s;ion of their new Ma&s;ter, and explain'd the Rules and Cu&s;toms of the School. Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> was prepar'd for their Reception, and thank'd my Lord for the Honour he did him. After Supper, my Lord and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> went to private Lodgings. The two Brothers had a Chamber to them|&s;elves, and <HI>Jack</HI> had a &s;mall one near the Back-Stairs at the End of the Gallery.</P>
<P>BEFORE Eight next Morning, my Lord and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ock</HI> went to Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s. All the Scholars had not yet made their Appearance; but the Bell ringing, the re&s;t &s;oon were in the School, where Mr. <HI>John|&s;ton</HI> and the Family attended my Lord,
<PB N="110" REF="117">
when all were &s;eated, one of the <HI>Lads</HI> mounted a De&s;k, and with great Reverence began the <HI>Morning</HI> Service of the <HI>Church;</HI> another read the <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> of the Day; Mr. <HI>Lilly,</HI> the U&s;her, rais'd the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> and the fir&s;t Boy fini&s;h'd the <HI>Prayers,</HI> except the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> which Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> always pro|nounced.&mdash;This over, an Hour was em|ploy'd in examining their Exerci&s;es, and giving others for the following Day, and then they retir'd to Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>MY Lord was again conducted to School, when one of the mo&s;t <HI>ingenious</HI> of the Gen|tlemen a&s;cended the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and made a <HI>Latin Oration</HI> on the <HI>Ri&s;e of Nobility.</HI> He very artfully in&s;inuated, how happy &s;ome <HI>Families</HI> were, in always leaving Heirs to their <HI>Virtues</HI> as well as their <HI>Titles;</HI> and, that he could point out, even in the&s;e de|generate Days, a <HI>living</HI> Example of that <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> were he at Liberty to &s;peak, with|out being &s;u&s;pected of <HI>Flattery;</HI> and con|cluded, that tho' many <HI>Patricians</HI> were a Scandal to their <HI>own</HI> and every <HI>other Order,</HI> yet &s;ome were always found who added a <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> to the <HI>Dignity,</HI> as their Lives were an <HI>Ornament</HI> to human Nature, and their <HI>Actions</HI> the Glory of their <HI>Fellow-Citizens.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN this Gentleman had fini&s;h'd, ano|ther mounted, and made a &s;hort Speech in
<PB N="111" REF="118">
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on the <HI>Happine&s;s of a good Educa|tion,</HI> which he compar'd to a <HI>tender Plant,</HI> under the Management of a &s;kilful <HI>Gardiner,</HI> who not only made it bear <HI>exqui&s;ite Fruit,</HI> but gave the Branches &s;uch an <HI>elegant</HI> Turn, as added a <HI>Beauty</HI> to the Place, and a <HI>De|light</HI> to the Eye.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip was extremely pleas'd with this Entertainment, but particularly with the di&s;tinct, emphatical and graceful Man|ner in which they pronounced their Words. He was not wanting in returning his Thanks to the young Gentlemen, and, giving the U&s;her <HI>Ten Guineas,</HI> begg'd he would be &s;o good to buy a Dozen <HI>Bows and Arrows,</HI> and erect two <HI>Butts</HI> in the next Field, which would not only agreeably entertain them, but be a mo&s;t healthful Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS Lord&s;hip then gave &s;ome private Directions to Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and recom|mending the Boys to the Care of his Wife, took a mo&s;t tender Leave, and return'd to <HI>Bounty-Hall.</HI></P>

play, as I am not at Lei&s;ure, at pre&s;ent, to entertain him in that Manner. I &s;hall con|fine my&s;elf to the narrow Compa&s;s of hint|ing at the Conduct of this School, as there is &s;omewhat <HI>peculiar</HI> in it, and what I could wi&s;h every other had a <HI>Part</HI> of, if not the <HI>Whole.</HI></P>
<P>MR. JOHNSTON was a Gentleman of very exten&s;ive Knowledge, great Applica|tion and Temper, chearful and ea&s;y in Con|ver&s;ation, and, above all, knew <HI>Mankind</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> perfectly well. As he had Talents peculiar for <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> and de|lighted in it, &s;o his <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> convinc'd him, that rearing up <HI>good</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> Members of Society, was the <HI>mo&s;t honourable</HI> Employment of Man.</P>
<P>HIS Hou&s;e could hold but twenty-five Youths, and each paid <HI>thirty Pounds</HI> a Year. When his Conduct was known, it is not to be imagined what <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> was made by Gentlemen, to have their Sons admitted, on a Vacancy.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t Care was the inculcating into his Pupils, the Principles of <HI>true Religion,</HI> as the &s;ure&s;t Foundation on which to build the <HI>moral Virtues.</HI> His next, was the in|&s;piring into them, a <HI>certain</HI> Proportion of <HI>Ambition</HI> and <HI>temporal Happine&s;s,</HI> and de|mon&s;trating, that <HI>Learning, Honour,</HI> and
<PB N="113" REF="120">
<HI>Integrity</HI> were the mo&s;t probable, if not the <HI>only Way,</HI> to attain them. For the&s;e Pur|po&s;es, they con&s;tantly attended <HI>Divine Ser|vice</HI> at Church and at Home: He made them read the <HI>Prayers</HI> alternately, and, as Occa&s;ions requir'd, gave hi&s;torical Accounts to explain or illu&s;trate &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI>&mdash;He always treated them, not as Children, but as <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> which made them endeavour to act as &s;uch. If &s;ome were negligent of their Duty, he &s;eem'd concern'd at it, and pity'd the <HI>un|happy Youth,</HI> that forgot him&s;elf &s;o much as to undo, by a voluntary Neglect, all that his Ance&s;tors had acquir'd by <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>HE took great Pains to give them an early Habit of <HI>Civility</HI> and <HI>Good Manners;</HI> and, by his own Practice, convinc'd them how agreeable &s;uch a Conduct was to every Man. He always &s;poke with a <HI>Bow,</HI> and Marks of Re&s;pect, and encouraged them to act in the like Manner to each other. He &s;hew'd them, by &s;undry <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>comic</HI> Examples, the U&s;e and Beauty of <HI>Polite|ne&s;s,</HI> and the Ab&s;urdity and bad Con&s;e|quences of a <HI>clowni&s;h</HI> and <HI>bruti&s;h</HI> Be|haviour.</P>
<P>THE Mornings were given to School Learning, in which, by his Skilfulne&s;s and
<PB N="114" REF="121">
A&s;&s;iduity, they made great Progre&s;s. As to fix'd <HI>Holidays,</HI> they were Strangers; but when all the Lads were perfect in their different Le&s;&s;ons, Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> always re|turn'd them Thanks, and then added,&mdash; <Q>This is very clever.&mdash;I find, Gentlemen, you have taken more than ordinary Pains; but I am &s;o far from de&s;iring too much <HI>Study,</HI> that, <HI>plea&s;e God,</HI> if To morrow be a fine Day, we will take the Diver&s;ion of <HI>Hunting</HI> or <HI>Fi&s;hing,</HI>&mdash;ju&s;t, Gentlemen, as you plea&s;e.</Q>&mdash; Thus they could always command a Day of Amu&s;ement; but that Lad pa&s;s'd his Time very <HI>di&s;agreeably,</HI> who, by his <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> had &s;topp'd the Plea&s;ure of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Evenings, in &s;ome Degree, were their own, either to &s;tudy in their Cham|bers, or divert them&s;elves in the large Yard or Field. If the Weather did not permit the latter, Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> us'd to &s;ay,&mdash; <Q>Well, Gentlemen, how &s;hall we pa&s;s our Time? I have a great Notion Mr. <HI>Moore</HI> can pronounce one of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Orations as well as Mr. <HI>Steven&s;on.</HI></Q>&mdash;Sometimes he pitch'd on one of <HI>Atterbury</HI>'s or <HI>Tillot|&s;on</HI>'s Sermons; &s;ometimes on Speeches in <HI>Tacitus</HI> or <HI>Livy;</HI> &s;ometimes on <HI>Parliamen|tary Debates,</HI> and &s;ometimes on <HI>Milton,</HI> or on occa&s;ional Pieces of Poetry, of Beauty and
<PB N="115" REF="122">
Elegance.&mdash;The Reader always mounted the Pulpit; but if he err'd from the <HI>right</HI> Pronounciation and <HI>true</HI> Meaning of the Author, or le&s;&s;en'd the Sen&s;e by <HI>fal&s;e Ac|tion</HI> or <HI>too languid</HI> a Delivery, Mr. <HI>John|&s;ton</HI> begg'd his Pardon, and de&s;ir'd to be permitted to &s;hew, wherein <HI>he thought</HI> it might be utter'd more to the Satisfaction of the Audience.&mdash;He then took his Place, and di&s;play'd the Orator.&mdash;His <HI>determin'd</HI> and <HI>re&s;olute</HI> Voice, &s;tirr'd their young Blood; but when he <HI>&s;oftened</HI> into <HI>Pity</HI> at &s;ome Di&s;tre&s;s, it caught the Lads, and their Countenances &s;hew'd it.</P>
<P>HE thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a young Man &s;hould be acquainted with the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of his <HI>own Country,</HI> at lea&s;t as &s;oon as that of <HI>Egypt, Greece,</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI> This was a fix'd Entertainment twice a Week; and his Comments, Ob&s;ervations and Re|flections on the different Parts, were adapt|ed to tho&s;e he made them to, and had al|ways &s;omewhat that &s;hew'd the Value of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and the Danger in not putting <HI>proper Bounds</HI> to it.&mdash;The Effects of <HI>Tyran|ny</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion;</HI>&mdash;the Nature of <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Government;</HI>&mdash;the Obligation of a <HI>King</HI> to his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and his <HI>Subjects</HI> to him;&mdash;the Happine&s;s of a <HI>good Monarch,</HI> with the <HI>Infamy</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> due to

<P>OF a chearful Evening Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> has propos'd the Repetition of a good <HI>Comedy;</HI> but, as he did not conceive that acting a Play was of U&s;e to Youth, he placed them in their Seats, and a&s;&s;ign'd them their dif|ferent Parts, which they read from dif|ferent Copies. The Comedies he generally cho&s;e were <HI>Steele</HI>'s, <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s, and &s;ome of <HI>Cibber</HI>'s, as they not only had Wit and Humour, but a certain <HI>Moral</HI> in them, not to be found in <HI>Congreve, Wycherly, Dryden,</HI> or <HI>Vanbrugh,</HI> but by wading through <HI>Ob|&s;cenity.</HI>&mdash;If the Gentlemen cho&s;e a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> he made them carefully ob&s;erve the Diffe|rence between a <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Utterance, and <HI>Ranting,</HI> and between the <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> Manner of Expre&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>Whining,</HI> and gave them Examples him&s;elf.</P>

<P>AS <HI>Jack Connor</HI> was not intended for a perfect Scholar, Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s Care on that Account was not &s;o exact as to o|ther Lads; but what regarded the moral and &s;ocial Duties, he received in common with them. In the three Years at this School, he had acquir'd a good Share of <HI>Latin</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Greek,</HI> but his chief Plea|&s;ure was in Reading, and making Extracts of u&s;eful and entertaining Pa&s;&s;ages from Hi&s;tory, Voyages, Poetry, and the like, of which Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> had a good Collection always open to the Gentlemen. This im|proved him in Writing, made &s;trong Im|pre&s;&s;ions on his Mind, and gave him a Fa|licity, and a genteel and ea&s;y Turn of Lan|guage, that much better Scholars are Stran|gers

to. He &s;poke <HI>French</HI> with great Flu|ency, for Mademoi&s;elle <HI>Nannett</HI> took &s;ome Pains to perfect him in it, and as he had a charming Voice, &s;he taught him many a|greeable <HI>French</HI> Songs.</P>
<P>HE was now in the Spring of Life, tall and well made. Health, Beauty, and Sprightline&s;s were always pre&s;ent with him, and Mirth and Joy danc'd in his Eyes. The&s;e, and his little Accompli&s;hments, made him care&s;s'd by all, and were &s;o re|markable, that even Madam <HI>John&s;ton</HI> has been frequently heard to &s;ay, <Q>Ma Foy, c'e&s;t un beau Gar&ccedil;on!&mdash;Voila de quoi faire un Joli Homme!</Q>&mdash;If <HI>Nannett</HI> was &s;ilent, &s;he looked, and perhaps thought the more.&mdash;<HI>The Dial &s;poke not, but it made &s;hrewd Signs.</HI></P>
<P>THE Juice of the Grape is in&s;ipid, nor can yield a Spirit till <HI>fermented.</HI> In this State, the Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t be pierc'd, and a Vent given to the jarring Particles, or it will bur&s;t its Tenement.&mdash;The Hand of Experience knows when to &s;top this Cha&s;m, &mdash;to fine it down, and give it the proper Time to acquire a Mellowne&s;s and Flavour that gladdens the Heart of Man, and adds Chearfulne&s;s and good Humour to every rational Company.&mdash;If Ignorance inter|feres
<PB N="122" REF="129">
in the Management, the Wine will be|come &s;our, and of little or no Value.</P>
<P>IS there not &s;omewhat of a fermenting Quality in human Nature? Or rather, is it not certain that there is?&mdash;Without this Fermentation, which the Pa&s;&s;ions only can give, Man would be but a moving Statue. 'Tis the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> that open his Under&s;tand|ing.&mdash;They lay the Plan of all his Opera|tions.&mdash;They conduct him fir&s;t to Objects of Plea&s;ure, and then branch out his Ima|gination to Glory&mdash;Honour&mdash;Riches. They poli&s;h him, and rai&s;e a De&s;ire of lov|ing, and of being loved.&mdash;In a Word, they alone, when ju&s;tly guided, can make him a rational Creature.&mdash;If unheeded, and &s;uf|fer'd to take an unnatural Bent, neither Fame nor Honour can re&s;ult from them, and the Man becomes the Pe&s;t of Society in&s;tead of the Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>OUR little Hero was not form'd without the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions. If from Inexperience, they &s;ometimes hurry'd him into imprudent Acts, and brought him into dangerous Si|tuations, he was the fir&s;t to cen&s;ure his own Conduct, and recur in&s;tantly to the Prin|ciples imbib'd in his Youth.&mdash;Of what U&s;e the&s;e <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Principles</HI> were to him, is too much a Part of this Hi&s;tory, to be omitted in their proper Place.&mdash;
<PB N="123" REF="130">
Since, therefore, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to act the impartial Hi&s;torian, and omit the Con&s;equences of the&s;e <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> I hope the candid Reader will excu&s;e the &s;eeming <HI>Le|vity</HI> of this Chapter.&mdash;My <HI>Hero</HI> is not a <HI>perfect Hero.</HI>&mdash;He is young, and without Experience. He has the Seeds of <HI>Man</HI> in him, and con&s;equently is faulty. Be&s;ides, as his whole Life turns on this Incident, I am compell'd to in&s;ert it, but hope the <HI>Moral</HI> will excu&s;e the <HI>Tale.</HI></P>
<P>THE Time was now come when <HI>Jack</HI> was to be tempted, and unwarily to yield. When he became <HI>criminal,</HI> he became <HI>un|happy.</HI>&mdash;Of late he took a particular Plea|&s;ure in <HI>Nannett</HI>'s Company, and &s;he, in Return, treated him with great Freedom, and with &s;omewhat more than mere Com|plai&s;ance. His Years prevented his &s;eeing the &s;ecret Motives of her Kindne&s;s. He was happy, becau&s;e &s;he was fond of him; but her Fondne&s;s aro&s;e from a different Prin|ciple.&mdash;She lov'd.</P>
<P>How far this Pa&s;&s;ion will extend it&s;elf, few are unacquainted, and poor <HI>Nannett</HI> practis'd every female Wile to gain a Heart invincible to her Charms, only from Igno|rance. Often has &s;he told him, <HI>he ought, at his Age, to avoid blu&s;hing when he &s;poke to her, and be more a Man, than to trem|ble
<PB N="124" REF="131">
at touching her Hand.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e and many other forcible Expre&s;&s;ions &s;he has reiterated, and &s;ometimes even ki&s;s'd him, but they only &s;erv'd to give him a &s;ecret unea&s;y Plea&s;ure, and a con&s;tant De&s;ire of her Pre|&s;ence, without a Knowledge of the Mean|ing.&mdash;She remark'd his confus'd Behaviour, and found, &s;he mu&s;t either renounce all Shame, by &s;peaking in direct Terms, or ab&s;olutely avoid him.&mdash;The Delicacy of her Sex as much forbid the one, as her violent Love did the other.</P>
<P>HER Invention was on the Rack, but at a&s;t &s;he remember'd a certain <HI>French</HI> Book, where a Lady is placed exactly in her Situa|tion. To this dear Volume &s;he turn'd, and determin'd to try the Experiment. She found Opportunities to oblige <HI>Jack</HI> to read mo&s;t Part of it to her, but defer'd the Lecture of the intere&s;ting Scene, till the fir&s;t Day Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> and the Lads went a Hunting. That Time &s;oon came, and the Evening before &s;he whi&s;per'd him, to a|void being of the Party, and they would fi|ni&s;h that charming Story. He with Eager|ne&s;s con&s;enting, &s;he told him how inconve|nient it would be to read in his little Room, <Q>but, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> as &s;oon as they are all gone, if you will promi&s;e to be very &s;ecret, and make no Noi&s;e, you may come to

my Chamber, and we can read at our Ea&s;e.</Q>&mdash;He promis'd, and this Conver&s;a|tion ended.</P>
<P>IT was now <HI>June,</HI> and being fine Wea|ther, all were ready for the Sport of the Field at Four in the Morning. <HI>Jack</HI> ex|cus'd him&s;elf to Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> on Account of a Book he was to fini&s;h, and a Letter to write to Mr. <HI>Kindly;</HI> and, &s;lily &s;lipping up into his Room, remain'd there till he &s;aw them all at &s;ome Di&s;tance. With cautious Steps he quietly mounted the Back-Stairs, and found <HI>Nannett</HI>'s Chamber Door on a Jarr ready to admit him. His Treading was not &s;o light, but her attentive Ear heard him, and putting the Curtain back, in a low Voice &s;he cry'd,&mdash;<Q>Lord ble&s;s me, <HI>Jack!</HI> Who would have expected you &s;o early?&mdash;I thought to have been up and dre&s;s'd, and now you &s;urpri&s;e a-body in Bed. Indeed I am quite a&s;ham'd of my|&s;elf,&mdash;but&mdash;&s;hut the Door, and &s;it down &s;oftly.</Q>&mdash;She then open'd the Curtain a little more, and <HI>Jack</HI> &s;at at &s;ome Di&s;tance. A Silence en&s;u'd for &s;ome Minutes, till at la&s;t he ventur'd to &s;ay &s;omething of the Book.&mdash;<Q>Well, &s;aid <HI>Nannett,</HI> look for it under my Pillow, and I'll read.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> &s;earch'd for &s;ome Time, but in vain; and, &s;he calling him an aukward Fellow, ro&s;e

carele&s;ly and &s;oon found it.&mdash;Undoubtedly &s;he had no Intention of expo&s;ing to his View her lovely Neck; for, no &s;ooner had &s;he caught his Eyes fix'd on that Part, and &s;aw the Tumult it occa&s;ion'd in him, than with great Precipitation &s;he cover'd it.&mdash; Her Head was once more laid on her Pil|low, and the Book in her Hand.&mdash;<Q>If, &s;aid &s;he, you keep &s;o far off, you can't hear me, and you had better come and &s;it on the Bed-&s;ide.</Q>&mdash;The poor Boy, willing to oblige, carefully mov'd, but found her right Arm negligently thrown out. This Impediment he gently remov'd, but not before he had frequently ki&s;s'd it. She call'd him a Fool, but her good Na|ture did not forbid this Sort of Folly.</P>
<P>JACK'S Spirits were up in Arms, &s;o we mu&s;t pre&s;ume he was going to &s;it down improperly, otherwi&s;e &s;he certainly would not have &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Ble&s;s me!&mdash;Why &s;ure you an't &s;o mad as to lie on the Bed;&mdash;But&mdash; if you are afraid your Shoes will make a Noi&s;e, and will ab&s;olutely do it, can't you pull them off?</Q>&mdash;His Shoes vani&s;h'd in an In&s;tant, and he placed him&s;elf where before he had no Intention.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>COME, come, &s;aid <HI>Nannett,</HI> let me make an End of my Story, but if you attempt to &s;erve me, as <HI>Amyntor</HI> does his

Silence and Secrecy reign'd, and no Eyes to witne&s;s their Joys, but tho&s;e of laughing Cupids, who hover'd round the inchanting Bower. <HI>Amyntor</HI> was all De&s;ire and Love, but his invincible Mo|de&s;ty, oblig'd the equally enamour'd <HI>Phillis</HI> to &s;upply by Management, what her Tongue could not utter. She in|&s;en&s;ibly conducted him to the Beginning of Charms, to which the Youth was an ab&s;olute Stranger.</Q>&mdash; <HI>Nannett</HI> continued to read, and, with great Judgment, laid the proper Empha&s;is on every Word; but at every tender or delicate Period, as many &s;uch there were, <HI>Jack</HI> became an exact Imi|tator, and frequently interrupted the Nar|ration. She often wonder'd at his A&s;&s;ur|ance, and declar'd her Anger, but her Countenance did not &s;eem to imply that Pa&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t &s;he was permitted to continue.&mdash;<Q>Too pre&s;&s;ing <HI>Amyntor,</HI> too yielding <HI>Phillis!</HI>&mdash;The Time, the Place, and every Opportunity con&s;pir'd with their mutual Inclinations.&mdash;A thou&s;and Dalliances interven'd, 'till Prudence,&mdash; Virtue,&mdash;and <HI>Phillis</HI> were lo&s;t.</Q></P>

<P>THE Clock &s;truck Seven, which rous'd them from their Dream of Happi|ne&s;s, to think on their Safety. <HI>Nannett</HI> was unwilling to part; but <HI>Jack,</HI> now <HI>more prudent,</HI> took an ha&s;ty Ki&s;s or two, and got to his Room unperceiv'd. He now began to reflect on his Conduct, and he judg'd him&s;elf greatly criminal. He now remem|ber'd Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s Precepts, which had for
<PB N="129" REF="136">
&s;ome Time been neglected, and call'd to Mind his la&s;t Words of <HI>Calamity</HI> and <HI>Mis|fortunes,</HI> if he departed from <HI>Virtue.</HI> The&s;e Thoughts gave him extreme Unea&s;ine&s;s, but he found him&s;elf greatly reliev'd by re|&s;olving to be guilty no more, and to &s;hun the Object. An unu&s;ual Gravity attended him the whole Day, which greatly di&s;turb'd <HI>Nannett,</HI> as he gave her no Opportunity of inquiring into the Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>HE was extremely pleas'd with this Con|que&s;t over him&s;elf, but alas! he little knew his own Heart; and, as he was a Stranger to the Ways of <HI>Men,</HI> how could he po&s;&s;ibly know that of <HI>Women?&mdash;Nannett,</HI> impati|ent to learn what pa&s;&s;ed in his Soul, waited in her Chamber till Two in the Morning, not doubting but <HI>Jack</HI> would find his Way there. The Di&s;appointment extremely mor|tify'd her Pride; however, &s;he determin'd at all Events, to have her Doubts <HI>&s;atisfied,</HI> and re&s;olutely ventur'd down, and got to his Bed-&s;ide. She prevented a Noi&s;e on his awaking, by telling her Name, and as &s;he was undre&s;s'd, without more Ceremony &s;lipp'd in, and took him in her Arms.</P>
<P>WHERE now were all his mighty Re&s;o|lutions?&mdash;Where were all Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s mo|ral Le&s;&s;ons?&mdash;Vani&s;h'd,&mdash;Lo&s;t in the Ob|&s;curity of the Night, and in the Arms of

Youth and Beauty!&mdash;She made him many tender Reproaches, but her Love forgave all.&mdash;His Reflections that Day were quite of another Complexion to the former, and he even thought him&s;elf a <HI>Fool,</HI> for being more timorous than a <HI>Girl.</HI> Be&s;ides, he argu'd the Impo&s;&s;ibility of Danger, or be|ing di&s;cover'd; and, that if it was a Crime, he at mo&s;t, was an&s;werable but for <HI>Half;</HI> but the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;on for continuing this Affair was, that he believed every Man would do the &s;ame, had he the &s;ame Op|portunity.&mdash;Thus, his Under&s;tanding was quite defeated by, what he thought, good Rea&s;on.&mdash;How many are there, who, by &s;uch fallacious Arguments, per&s;uade, or en|deavour to per&s;uade them&s;elves into Evil, even contrary to their real Opinion? And how many are there, who are but too &s;uc|ce&s;sful in their Attempts to deceive them|&s;elves?</P>
<P>HIS Amour went charmingly on for a|bout &s;ix Weeks, nor could there be, in his Imagination, an happier Mortal.&mdash;He in|&s;en&s;ibly dropt all boyi&s;h Amu&s;ements, and was much le&s;s punctual and exact at School, than formerly. His Vi&s;age began to change, and the Ro&s;es in his Cheeks to fade; in&s;o|much, that <HI>Madam John&s;ton</HI> really thought him out of Order, and very innocently di|rected
<PB N="131" REF="138">
<HI>Nannett</HI> to take &s;ome Care of the poor Boy, and give him <HI>&s;omething warm,</HI> when he was in Bed. <HI>Nannett</HI> mo&s;t punctu|ally obey'd her Commands, but <HI>Jack</HI> grew paler notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>MR. JOHNSTON, at la&s;t, ob&s;erv'd an Al|teration in <HI>Jack,</HI> and, for &s;ome Time, was of his Wife's Opinion; but, as Nothing could e&s;cape his Penetration, he perceiv'd that the Boy's Eyes &s;parkl'd, and his Face had an uncommon Glow, whenever <HI>Nan|nett</HI> enter'd the Room. He likewi&s;e re|mark'd a peculiar Plea&s;ure in their Counte|nances, when they &s;poke to each other, and even when their Eyes chanc'd to meet, which they frequently did.&mdash;'Tis a Que&s;tion would puzzle <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Moivre,</HI> Whether mo&s;t Intrigues were began, or were di&s;co|ver'd by the <HI>Eyes?</HI> Certain it is, they are as apt to betray as &s;educe. If the&s;e faith|le&s;s Companions have a Language to per|&s;uade us into &s;ecret Deeds, they have ano|ther to divulge it.&mdash;What Pity it is, they are placed in &s;o con&s;picuous a Spot!</P>
<P>MR. JOHNSTON in his Youth was a Ma|&s;ter of this Language, and read in their Hearts, what gave him extreme Pain. He was tortur'd with &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, and rea&s;on'd him&s;elf into the Conduct he was to ob&s;erve, &s;hould his Su&s;picions be well
<PB N="132" REF="139">
grounded.&mdash;He knew, &s;hould his Re&s;ent|ment vent it&s;elf in Words, the <HI>Reputation</HI> of his <HI>Niece</HI> was lo&s;t, and the Character of his School would &s;uffer a &s;evere Wound.&mdash; To cha&s;ti&s;e the Boy, would an&s;wer but the &s;ame End.&mdash;To join them in Marriage was ridiculous, and, to &s;uffer them to live peace|ably in Iniquity was impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;For two Days was he thus agitated, before he could fix on a Scheme to &s;ave all Appearances, but particularly tho&s;e that could affect his own Family.&mdash;When he had revolved his Plan, and taken a Re&s;olution, his next Step was to &s;atisfy his eager Doubts.</P>
<P>The third Morning, about Three o'Clock, he quietly &s;tepp'd into <HI>Jack</HI>'s Room. He examined the Bed, which he founded un|ruffled and cold, and immediately conclud|ed <HI>Jack</HI> was in a <HI>warmer Place.</HI> He pau&s;ed for a few Minutes to &s;tifle his Indignation, and let the Hurry of his Spirits &s;ub&s;ide, and then quietly mounted to his <HI>Niece</HI>'s A|partment. He gently open'd the Curtain, and found the happy criminal Pair lock'd in each other's Arms, bidding Defiance to all worldly Cares, for they were fa&s;t a&s;leep. &mdash;For &s;ome Time he gazed with A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and &s;carcely credited the Evidence of his Eyes.&mdash;At la&s;t he &s;tirred <HI>Nannett,</HI> who wakened with a tender Expre&s;&s;ion to

<P>JACK got to the Garden as directed, but trembled at Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s Approach, who, a&s;&s;uming a Smile, gave the Boy not a little Courage.&mdash;'Well, Sir, <HI>&s;aid his Ma&s;ter,</HI> it &s;eems you have lately pa&s;&s;ed your Time very chearfully, and turned over other Leaves be&s;ides <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek;</HI> however, I am not now here to upbraid you with Ingratitude, or with the Breach of all Laws, Human and Divine; neither &s;hall I now correct you, or &s;end you to Pri&s;on, and have you hang'd, as the Laws direct; but, as I &s;hall always have it in my Power, &s;o I &s;hall certainly put it in Practice, ex|cept you will give me your mo&s;t &s;acred Promi&s;e, to do whatever I &s;hall order.' &mdash;'Sir, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> with great Confu&s;ion, I really don't know how to appear before God or you, after my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; but I hope my &s;incere Repentance, with my mo&s;t &s;olemn Vow to obey all your Directions, will atone for my Crimes'&mdash; I know, reply'd Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> you ab|hor a Lye, therefore I will tru&s;t you.

On this Side the Windmill you will find my Man <HI>John</HI> with a Carr, who will have particular Or|ders to take Care of you, and you will follow his Directions. As I know you will believe me, I give you my Word and Honour, that I intend only your own Good; but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for your Peace and mine, that you promi&s;e

<P>JACK threw him&s;elf on his Knees, and mo&s;t &s;olemnly vow'd, in the Pre&s;ence of God, religiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve all his Directi|ons; and ri&s;ing, a&s;k'd his Ma&s;ter what he intended to do with his Shirts, Books, and his other little Effects? But being a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;hould find them all &s;afe in <HI>Dublin,</HI> was quite ea&s;y on that Account.&mdash;<Q>Now, &s;aid Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd, and I hope you will have Rea&s;on to be content.

<P>AS they walk'd towards the Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> gave him many good Le&s;&s;ons for his future Conduct.&mdash;He very earne&s;tly re|commended a mode&s;t, &s;ober, and religious Life, as what only could give him true Joy and real Happine&s;s.&mdash;He told him, that God &s;ometimes permitted Good to come out of Evil and pray'd it might be &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; but, that no Man ought to depend that &s;uch a Grace would at all

<P>MUCH more was &s;aid on this Subject, and in &s;o tender a Manner, as greatly to affect the Boy, and make a &s;trong Impre&s;|&s;ion on his Mind. Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> concluded, with &s;aying, <Q>You have not much of the common <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Manner of &s;peaking, but let me advi&s;e you to forget the little you have, and endeavour to &s;peak like the People you live with, which will prevent your being often laugh'd at, and ridicul'd by the Ignorant and Vulgar, and none other can do it.&mdash;Your Name is quite <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> but I &s;hall call you JOHN CONYERS, in my Letters, and henceforward let that be your Name. And now, Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> I think we have fully &s;ettled this Matter; therefore go in, and behave as u&s;ual; but remember your Promi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>THEY got to the Hou&s;e before any of the Servants were up, &s;o their Meeting was a Secret.&mdash;When <HI>Jack</HI> was alone, he be|gan very &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on his Situation.

Hand, he regretted parting with his dear <HI>Nannett,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Manner he had promis'd, and had a violent Inclination to take one tender Farewel, but his Vow pre|vented him. The Injunctions laid on him, he thought very extraordinary; but the Dread of Puni&s;hment and Shame, and the Anger of my Lord and Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> made him acquie&s;ce with Patience to the&s;e hard Terms. Be&s;ides, as he really had an entire Confidence in, and a Love for Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> he doubted not but he had good Rea&s;ons for what he ordered.</P>
<P>THO' his Effects were to meet him in <HI>Dublin,</HI> he had the wi&s;e Precaution of put|ting on two Shirts, and taking his Pur&s;e, which now contained but eleven Guineas. He likewi&s;e put in his Coat Pocket the little Box and In&s;tructions given him by Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> and all the little Manu&s;cripts he had. Thus dre&s;s'd, and fix'd in his Re&s;olutions, he waited on Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and begged his Leave to vi&s;it Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> who lived about four Miles to the We&s;t.&mdash;Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> he|&s;itated for &s;ome Time, but his Wife inter|ceding, &s;he obtained Permi&s;&s;ion, provided he promi&s;ed to go Half a Mile round, and not cro&s;s the Ford which was &s;ometimes dangerous.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you reflect on the Relation I bare to you, and on my Ten|derne&s;s and Affection, you mu&s;t be con|vinc'd that all my Care and Pains is to endeavour to make, and perhaps &s;ee you an happy and a worthy Man.&mdash;You are now to begin a new Scene of Life, where, in&s;tead of the Guardian&s;hip of a fond Father you mu&s;t be guided and di|rected by &s;o dangerous a Tutor as your|&s;elf&mdash;Tho' you mu&s;t be far remov'd from my Pre&s;ence, yet, I conjure you by every &s;acred Tye, to think on your Father and the Advice he now gives you.</P>
<P>BE careful in ob&s;erving every Duty of RELIGION. You will find it the &s;ure&s;t, and perhaps the only Way to keep <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Content</HI> in your Heart, and a Serenity and Chearfulne&s;s in your Countenance&mdash;<HI>By being a Man, be not a&s;ham'd of being a Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>CANDOUR, <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> are &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t Links that bind Men to each other. When the&s;e
<PB N="144" REF="151">
are ab&s;ent, Su&s;picion, Fraud and De|ceit, will fill each Brea&s;t, and make us rather Companions for the wild Inhabi|tants of the Fore&s;t, than A&s;&s;ociates to Animals, who boa&s;t &s;uperior Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>YOU are to live in the World.&mdash;You are to &s;tudy the large Volume of Man|kind.&mdash;Whil&s;t thus employ'd, forget not that Mankind are &s;tudying you.&mdash; Nature has given you an ea&s;y flexible Temper, therefore guard again&s;t the Charms of <HI>Flattery.</HI>&mdash;I know you will avoid the <HI>Profligate</HI> and <HI>Prophane:</HI> Shun likewi&s;e the <HI>Demure,</HI> the <HI>Preci&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Very Godly.</HI> &mdash; Experience demon&s;trates that <HI>Hypocri&s;y, Cunning</HI> and <HI>Deceit,</HI> ge|nerally lurk under it, and that the <HI>Righteous overmuch,</HI> have other Schemes to <HI>work out,</HI> be&s;ides their Salvation.</P>
<P>WITH <HI>Virtue, Truth</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> which I tru&s;t you will pre&s;erve, there are Duties of Society that give Beauty and Harmony, and therefore mu&s;t not be neglected.</P>
<P>A TENDERNESS for our Fellow-Crea|tures, a compa&s;&s;ionate Turn for their Misfortunes, and Pity for their Weak|ne&s;&s;es, are what we owe our&s;elves and them.&mdash;By not paying this Debt, we renounce our Claim to Humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="152">POLITE Behaviour and Complacency of Manners places every Action in the mo&s;t advantageous Light, and adds ir|re&s;i&s;tible Grace to every Word and every Motion.&mdash;Be &s;incere in &s;uch a Conduct, and &s;uffer not your Lips to give the Lye to your Heart.&mdash;There is a Medium to be followed even to Per&s;ons we have an ill Opinion of.</P>
<P>AS a general good Behaviour is nece&s;|&s;ary to, and required by all, you cannot fail of being remarkably &s;o to &s;ome par|ticulars; but avoid making Friend&s;hips, till by Time you are convinced they de|&s;erve your's.&mdash;When you have found a Friend, dete&s;t the old and fal&s;e Maxim of <HI>living with him as tho' he may become an Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>GO not into the Way of Temptation; for, believe me, it will but too often fall in your's. Re&s;olution is &s;trong; but the &s;tronge&s;t is lodg'd in a <HI>frail Body,</HI> therefore depend not too much upon it, but, rather owe your Safety to a timely Flight.</P>
<P>IN your Dre&s;s, avoid as much as po&s;|&s;ible the Gaudy and Fluttering, but in the Neat and Clean, endeavour to be re|markable. A Carefulne&s;s in properly &s;etting off the Per&s;on, is commendable

and u&s;eful. It argues a De&s;ire of plea|&s;ing, and gratifies the Eye of every Be|holder. A Propriety in Dre&s;s, and a certain Sobriety of Deportment, free from Affectation and Formality, will always add Weight to your Conver&s;a|tion, and make it &s;ought after.</P>
<P>COMPANY and Chearfulne&s;s are ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and of infinite U&s;e; but a con|&s;tant Jollity and Mirth betrays &s;uch a Levity in the Mind, that your Pre&s;ence will never be de&s;ir'd but merely to <HI>divert</HI> others, who&s;e Regard cea&s;es the In&s;tant the Laughter is over.&mdash;Should your Wit offend, be a&s;&s;ured of an Enemy for ever.</P>
<P>AS your Inclinations lead you to the Study of the Laws, you will &s;oon per|ceive the Strength of the Foundation on which the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution is built.&mdash; You will &s;oon ob&s;erve the Happine&s;s of that Kingdom, where the different Ranks of Men have their different Ope|rations, all coinciding and centering in the Pre&s;ervation of the Whole.&mdash;Let your Heart and your Hand be always ready to &s;upport this Structure.&mdash;It has often been in Danger, and &s;uffered mighty-Revolutions; but, as it is now fully repaired by a PROTESTANT AR|CHITECT,

be it your Care, as much as in you lies, to defend it from every Fo|reign <HI>Political,</HI> and from every Dome|&s;tick <HI>wicked</HI> Attempt.</P>
<P>AMBITION and Pride are Crimes of the mo&s;t dangerous Tendency, yet, like Opiates, a &s;mall Quantity is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, as a large one gives the Pa|tient up to Frenzy and Madne&s;s, and, in the End, de&s;troys him.&mdash;To have the&s;e in a ju&s;t Degree, will rai&s;e a De|&s;ire of excelling, and prevent a Mean|ne&s;s of Conduct.</P>

As they walk'd he told him they were going to Mr. <HI>Champignon</HI>'s the Weaver in <HI>Spittle Fields,</HI> with whom he had agreed to bind him Apprentice. <Q>You may, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Strong,</HI> &s;tay &s;even or eight Months on Trial; but I dare &s;ay you will like your Situation &s;o well, that you will have Rea&s;on to thank your Friends.</Q> &mdash;<HI>Jack,</HI> though not quite pleas'd, was glad to find Matters no wor&s;e, and with more Chearfulne&s;s continued his March to the Weaver's.</P>
<P>MR.

He was about Sixty-five or Seventy Years of
<PB N="152" REF="159">
Age, tall and very thin. His &s;warthy Skin did not &s;eem to belong to what it co|ver'd, and his Cheek-Bones, in particular, di&s;cover'd a violent Inclination to e&s;cape through. He had on an old grea&s;y Stuff Gown, and a double mill'd Cap, that per|haps was formerly Scarlet. In &s;hort, <HI>Jack</HI> thought he was bound Apprentice to a Skeleton, but a certain good natur'd Smile, and an agreeable Vivacity in the old Man, gave him &s;ome Pro&s;pect of being better than he imagin'd.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR <HI>Champignon,</HI> was one of the Million whom the Religious Wi&s;dom of LEWIS the <HI>Fourteenth</HI> compell'd to vi&s;it <HI>England</HI> and other Prote&s;tant Countries, and who brought with them many u&s;eful Arts and Manufactures. He was a Man of great Application and Indu&s;try, which, with great <HI>Saving</HI> for a Cour&s;e of Years, made him worth about Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds. He had a Gaiety in his Temper, and &s;uch a Fund of natural good Under|&s;tanding, that his Company was extreme|ly agreeable to many eminent Merchants. His Wife was a good Sort of old Woman; but his only Child Mademoi&s;elle TONTON, was a mo&s;t lively and pritty Girl of Twen|ty-four Years of Age. Her Complexion was not of the brighte&s;t, but her &s;parkling
<PB N="153" REF="160">
Eyes, and her good Shape, made her a very de&s;irable Object. Her Father, from the Stingine&s;s of his Temper, had di&s;ap|pointed her of two very good Matches, and the &s;candalous Chronicle of the Neigh|bourhood &s;aid, &s;he had taken a proper Re|venge.</P>
<P>CHAMPIGNON was &s;o whim&s;ical, that he &s;carcely ever &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> and his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was &s;uch a Medley, as to occa&s;ion frequent Laughter. When he was a&s;k'd, Why he &s;poke not better <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he always an|&s;wer'd,&mdash;<Q>De par tout les Diables! &mdash; How you av&egrave; me &s;peak &s;o better Englis? Sacre Chien!

<P>JACK was employ'd in the u&s;ual Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a junior Apprentice, and in wea|ving Ribbons, which he did tolerably well, but found he had not a natural Call to be ty'd to a Loom.</P>
<P>IT would be impertinent to attempt to entertain the Reader with the many arch Tricks <HI>Jack</HI> play'd his new Ma&s;ter, or with the Mirth <HI>Mon&s;ieur Champignon</HI>'s En|gli&s;h afforded.

Mi&s;s, in particular, was greatly diverted with his agreeable Chat, and he overheard her one Morning, tell her Maid; <Q>That con&s;idering <HI>Conyers</HI> was <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> he was the prettie&s;t young Fellow &s;he ever &s;aw in her Life.</Q>&mdash;Though his Manner of &s;peaking was greatly improved, yet there remained enough of his Country to be &s;everely banter'd by Mi&s;s <HI>Tonton.</HI> She often in&s;i&s;ted on his making Bulls and Blunders. She laugh'd at the Words, <HI>Unwell &mdash; Big Coat, &mdash; E're Ye&s;terday,</HI> and the like. &mdash; <HI>Jack,</HI> who was now be|come pretty free, a&s;k'd her, if &s;he under|&s;tood him when he &s;poke.&mdash;'Yes, &s;aid &s;he, I comprehend your Meaning well enough; but you have &s;uch unaccount|able Phra&s;es, one had need of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Expo&s;itor.'&mdash;'I'm glad, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Jack,</HI> you are pleas'd to allow I &s;peak &s;o as to be comprehended, but a Gen|tleman, the other Day, in our Ware|hou&s;e cry'd out, <HI>"Did no body &s;ee any body take up never a Hat."</HI>&mdash;'I beg, Ma|dam,

<P>SUCH Sort of Conver&s;ation happen'd frequently, and was equally amu&s;ing, but as he artfully &s;uffer'd her to have the Supe|riority in every Argument, and even a&s;k'd her Advice and In&s;truction, &s;he conceived a va&s;t Opinion of his uncultivated <HI>Genius,</HI> and his natural good Parts.&mdash;The&s;e Sort of Beginnings, generally lead to, and are but the Forerunners of Thoughts, not &s;o pro|per to be plainly &s;et down.&mdash;The&s;e imper|tinent Thoughts but too often occur'd,&mdash; <HI>Jack</HI> had them not,&mdash;Gue&s;s who then?</P>
<P>MISS TONTON was one Morning at her Toilet very judiciou&s;ly adju&s;ting her Head|dre&s;s before &s;he fix'd her Stays. Young <HI>Conyers,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing her Chamber, was per|ceiv'd by the Reflection of her Gla&s;s, and calling him in a great Hurry, begg'd he'd look down her back for a Flea that teaz'd her immoderately. <HI>Jack,</HI> very innocently, examin'd the Part, and declar'd he &s;aw nothing.&mdash;<Q>Lord, &s;aid <HI>Tonton,</HI> you're &s;uch an unhandy Booby, you'll let the Crea|ture e&s;cape, but look &s;harp, <HI>Jack,</HI> I beg of you.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> look'd, but his Imagina|tion
<PB N="156" REF="163">
being warm'd by the Touch, his Un|der&s;tanding became the clearer.&mdash;<Q>Now, cry'd he, I &s;ee it.&mdash;There it hops, faith 'tis a Swinger.</Q>&mdash;He then vigourou&s;ly pur&s;u'd the flying Animal, which, traver|&s;ing the whole Plain of her Back, took its Cour&s;e to the Eminencies in Front, where it afforded a mo&s;t delightful Cha&s;e. It &s;kip'd from Hill to Hill, practis'd all the Craft of the Hare, but <HI>Jack</HI> was &s;o keen a Sport&s;man, that he re&s;ted not till he had fairly caught it.</P>
<P>ASSOCIATES in Amu&s;ements become In|timates, and frequently form Friend&s;hips. 'Twas &s;o in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. <HI>Tonton</HI> be|gan to be extremely fond of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Com|pany, and found &s;o many Opportunities to hunt, that one would imagine &s;he had col|lected all the Fleas in the Pari&s;h, to afford him Diver&s;ion. Her Maid <HI>Ber&s;heba,</HI> who was old and ugly, prevented many an Eve|ning's Sport, &s;o &s;he was oblig'd to make U&s;e of her as a Whipper-in, or as a Groom to hold the Hor&s;es. By this notable Con|trivance, <HI>Jack</HI> was frequently introduc'd when the Family were in Bed, and &s;tay'd till they were near ri&s;ing, when he quietly retir'd through the old Maid's Room, who&s;e <HI>Hey-day of the Blood</HI> was not over, but &s;ometimes <HI>mutiny'd in the Matron's
<PB N="157" REF="164">
Bones.</HI>&mdash;It &s;eems poor <HI>Ber&s;heba</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;ubject to Fleas, and the Hunting them became not a little trouble&s;ome to <HI>Jack.</HI> It chagreen'd him much, and made <HI>Tonton</HI> very unea&s;y.&mdash;At la&s;t he obtain'd a long Re&s;pite, but not in the Manner he cho&s;e, for he was taken extremely ill, and a vio|lent Fever en&s;u'd. No doubt he wanted not proper Care, and in Six Weeks he be|gan to return to his Sen&s;es, and a little to recover.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t U&s;e he made of his Rea&s;on, was to confe&s;s the Ju&s;tice of the Puni&s;h|ment for his repeated Crimes.&mdash;<HI>Bounty-Hall, Portarlington,</HI> his Friends, and all their good Advice, now came ru&s;hing into his Thoughts with &s;uch Force, that he relap|&s;ed, and had like never to have given me the Opportunity of writing his Hi&s;tory. His Youth and good Con&s;titution at length prevail'd, and all Danger was over, except what might proceed from his extreme Weakne&s;s, or falling into a Con&s;umption. He recover'd &s;o &s;lowly, that the Doctor, like his Brethren, when they know not what el&s;e to do, advis'd a Change of Air for a Month or two. <HI>Champignon</HI> was one of the few <HI>Frenchmen</HI> of Sub&s;tance, who had not a Country Hou&s;e, and to take Lodgings and maintain <HI>Jack,</HI> would be at|tended

with an Expence he by no means could bring him&s;elf to think of.</P>
<P>MR. VILLENEUF, a very eminent Mer|chant in <HI>Black-Fryars,</HI> was an intimate Friend, and had frequently diverted him|&s;elf with <HI>Jack,</HI> who&s;e pertinent An&s;wers and good Under&s;tanding, made him a Sort of Favourite.&mdash;<HI>'Champignon,</HI> &s;aid he one Day, Why don't you &s;end poor <HI>Conyers</HI> to the Country?&mdash;The Lad will die here, and his Funeral will co&s;t you more than a Month's Lodging.'&mdash;'Ha, Ha, &s;aid <HI>Champignon,</HI> I do no &s;uch a-ting.&mdash;<HI>Par|bleu</HI> I &s;end <HI>Jean</HI> to de Diable&mdash;to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Strang.</HI>&mdash;Dat Gentilman he never come &s;ay, <HI>Champignon,</HI> how <HI>Jean Con|yer</HI> do?&mdash;Mon&s;ieur de <HI>Strang</HI> &s;ay noting, do noting&mdash;Poor <HI>Champignon</HI> mu&s;te do tout.&mdash;<HI>Ventrebleu!</HI> Je crois dat de Monde tink me diablement rich&egrave;!&mdash;I tell&ecirc; you, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Villeneuf,</HI> poor <HI>Champignon</HI> &s;all dye, alors you will &s;ee, you will regard&eacute; all my pauvre Riche&s;&s;e.'&mdash;'A d'autres, <HI>&s;aid Villeneuf,</HI> I know you better.

<P>MR. VILLENEUF, the Son, was a Gen|tleman of Twenty-four Years of Age. He pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Retirement,</HI> was extremely good natur'd and <HI>charitable;</HI> but had a <HI>Gloomine&s;s</HI> in his Temper, that made him aver&s;e to much Company and Mirth. His Father, who had no other Child, was oblig'd to indulge him in his Humour, and &s;upply him liberally with <HI>Money</HI> to gratify his <HI>generous Spirit.</HI> His large Fortune could very well afford this Expence.</P>
<P>JACK was as happy as his di&s;turb'd Thoughts would permit, which were ever reflecting on his pa&s;t Conduct, and up|braiding him with Actions of which he dreaded the Con&s;equence.&mdash;<HI>Repentance,</HI> he thought, might avert a further Puni&s;hment, and &s;et him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to think of it.&mdash; He knew, that <HI>truly</HI> to <HI>repent,</HI> he mu&s;t lead a <HI>new Life,</HI> and avoid his <HI>former,</HI> and <HI>all other</HI> Crimes.&mdash;But how difficult! what Struggles had he to forget <HI>Nannett</HI> and <HI>Tonton!</HI> he could not avoid <HI>remembring</HI> the very Thing he wanted to be <HI>blotted</HI> from

his <HI>Memory;</HI> then how could he &s;ay <HI>he would forget them?</HI>&mdash;No, but as he could not prevent the Intru&s;ion of <HI>Thought,</HI> he was determin'd to refrain from <HI>actual Evil.</HI> As this was the utmo&s;t he could bring him|&s;elf to, he re&s;ted &s;atisfy'd that this <HI>Re&s;olu|tion</HI> would hold firm.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Week at <HI>Greenwich</HI> was not extreamly plea&s;ant, as young Mr. <HI>Villeneuf,</HI> &s;eldom &s;poke to, or &s;eem'd to regard him, but as the Apprentice of a Weaver, for whom his Father had &s;ome Value. <HI>Jack</HI> perceived the Rea&s;on of this Coolne&s;s, and by Degrees &s;tole in a <HI>Latin Sentence;</HI> and &s;ome <HI>judicious</HI> Ob&s;ervations, but in &s;uch Language and Accent (for he had quite lo&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tone) that &s;urpriz'd the young Gentleman, and made him de&s;irous of a more intimate Acquaintance. This he ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, and as <HI>Jack</HI>'s Health and Spirits encreas'd, he made great Progre&s;s in the Affections of Mr. <HI>Villeneuf.</HI></P>
<P>THE old Gentleman had determin'd to &s;end his Son to <HI>Paris</HI> for a Year or two, that by Travel, and a different Climate and Company, he might be brought in&s;en&s;ibly to act <HI>like other Men.</HI> He found his Son was much pleas'd with <HI>Jack,</HI> and propos'd his going with him as a kind of <HI>Servant,</HI> of whom he might at Times make a <HI>Com|panion.</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="168">
The young Gentleman expre&s;s'd his Satisfaction, and <HI>Conyers</HI> was va&s;tly de|lighted at &s;eeing a little more of the World, and not be oblig'd to return to the <HI>perpetual Motion of the Shuttle.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST leave the Management of <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Champignon</HI> to the old Gentleman, and bid adieu to <HI>Spittle-Fields, Tonton</HI> and <HI>Ber&s;heba,</HI> for in three Months Mr. <HI>Villeneuf</HI> and <HI>Conyers</HI> found them&s;elves in the Capital of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>JACK was now in his Ninteenth Year, of a good Stature, good Complexion, and, when dre&s;s'd, was a very <HI>genteel</HI> and <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> Fellow. His Eyes were black and &s;prightly; he had a mo&s;t agreeable Smile, and &s;omething &s;o ea&s;y in his Man|ner, that he prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every one in his Favour, almo&s;t at fir&s;t Sight. When he &s;poke, it was with <HI>great Mode&s;ty,</HI> but his Learning and good Sen&s;e made him heard with Plea&s;ure. He had found out the
<PB N="163" REF="170">
<HI>grand Secret</HI> of Conver&s;ation, which was to <HI>&s;peak &s;eldom, but to the Purpo&s;e,</HI> and he had likewi&s;e learn'd to get the better in an Ar|gument, <HI>by &s;ometimes giving it up.</HI></P>
<P>HIS fix'd Allowance from Mr. <HI>Villeneuf</HI> was but &s;mall, but he equipp'd him with decent Cloaths, ruffled Shirts, and from Time to Time with <HI>Money</HI> &s;ufficient to dine at a good Ordinary, and be always clean and neat. Mr. <HI>Villeneuf</HI> generally went out about Ten in the Morning, and return'd to his Lodgings about Five in the Evening, except he went to the Comedy, but never expected <HI>Conyers</HI> till about Eight or Nine o'Clock. <HI>Jack</HI> always attended when he was dre&s;&s;ing, but was of little U&s;e, as a <HI>French</HI> Footman performed all that Opera|tion.</P>
<P>MR. VILLENEUF had a <HI>Fencing</HI> and a <HI>Dancing</HI> Ma&s;ter, rather becau&s;e it was the <HI>Fa&s;hion,</HI> and that his Father in&s;i&s;ted on it, than for any U&s;e they might be of to him. The Gentlemen con&s;tantly attended, but <HI>Conyers</HI> principally received the Benefit of their In&s;tructions. He likewi&s;e was very diligent at a Neighbouring Academy for Riding. This was of infinite Advantage, as it &s;trengthened his Limbs, and gave him a Carriage that &s;till added to the Graceful|ne&s;s of his Per&s;on. When his Curio&s;ity
<PB N="164" REF="171">
was pretty much gratify'd, he applied clo&s;ely to the be&s;t <HI>French</HI> Authors, making their <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> familiar to him. He examined and enquired, as far as he was able, into their <HI>Laws,</HI> their <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners;</HI> and made &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, that more learned Travellers need not have been a&s;ham'd of. He had a Genius for Figures, and made him&s;elf a tolerable Ma&s;ter of &s;ome Branches in Mathematicks. In a Word, he took Care to be fully employ'd.</P>
<P>HIS young Ma&s;ter, or rather his <HI>Friend,</HI> had Books enough, and in Conver&s;ation gave him many Hints which he improv'd. One Night at Supper, <HI>Villeneuf</HI> told him, he wonder'd at his &s;taying &s;o much in the Hou&s;e; and that he ought to go more into the <HI>World!</HI> 'You are always <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> por|ing over Books, and advi&s;ing me again&s;t what you practi&s;e your&s;elf.'&mdash;'I confe&s;s, Sir, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> it is but too true. I am nece&s;&s;itated to act like the <HI>Ga&s;coin;</HI> for, not having it in my Power to read the <HI>Great,</HI> I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with the <HI>&s;mall World,</HI> as I find it in Books.'&mdash; Pray, <HI>&s;aid Mr. Villeneuf,</HI> how did the <HI>Ga&s;coin</HI> manage?&mdash;'Why, Sir, <HI>reply'd Conyers,</HI> the <HI>Ga&s;coin</HI> was ju&s;t as <HI>poor</HI> a Fellow as I am, but he took it into his Head to be <HI>indu&s;trious,</HI> and amu&s;e him&s;elf
<PB N="165" REF="172">
with &s;elling Water in <HI>Paris.</HI> An old Friend met him and his Pitchers, and was va&s;tly &s;urpriz'd that a <HI>Gentleman</HI> of his <HI>Noble Blood,</HI> could &s;o demean him&s;elf, as to follow <HI>&s;o low</HI> an Occupation. Lord! <HI>reply'd</HI> the <HI>Ga&s;coin,</HI> you quite mi&s;take the Matter, for I am a Man of <HI>great Impor|tance,</HI> and &s;uch a Favourite at Court, that the <HI>King</HI> has granted me <HI>the Waters of the Sein,</HI> but, as I have not found a <HI>Chap</HI> to buy the <HI>Whole</HI> at once, you &s;ee I am ob|lig'd to <HI>retail it.</HI>&mdash;'So, <HI>&s;aid Villeneuf,</HI> the Moral of the Story is, that your <HI>Po|verty</HI> prevents your following my Ad|vice; but henceforward, that &s;hall be no Ob&s;tacle. My Appointment is more than I po&s;&s;ibly know how to &s;pend, and mu&s;t de&s;ire your A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Management of Part of it. To begin, take the&s;e <HI>Fif|ty Pieces,</HI> and command more when they are gone.'&mdash;Sir, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> I own I meant to beg a little Money, but could never imagine your <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Good|ne&s;s,</HI> exten&s;ive and great as they are, could lead you into &s;uch an Act, that my poor Services can <HI>never repay.'</HI></P>
<P>CONYERS, like <HI>Numps</HI> in the Comedy, was quite another Creature with <HI>Money</HI> in his Pocket, and &s;o elate, that he could not avoid imparting his good Fortune to <HI>Madam

Commode,</HI> the Milliner where they lodg'd.

This young <HI>Lady</HI> was ble&s;s'd with peculiar <HI>Eloquence,</HI> and &s;uch a Fluency of Speech, that <HI>Conyers</HI> pre&s;s'd her Acceptance of a Couple of <HI>Lewis d'Ors,</HI> which, by &s;ome <HI>accidental</HI> Words, he found &s;he &s;tood in Need of. With great Difficulty &s;he con&s;ented, but a&s;|&s;ur'd him, <HI>it was owing to his irre&s;i&s;table Politene&s;s.</HI>&mdash;He imagin'd &s;ometimes, &s;he was <HI>troubled with Fleas,</HI> but he found tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> more nimble than tho&s;e he had be|fore hunted; for, though he often attempt|ed, yet he never could catch one of <HI>Ma|delain</HI>'s.</P>

The Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Cane</HI> and <HI>Kicking</HI> la&s;ted a full half Hour, and was &s;o entertaining,
<PB N="175" REF="182">
that they have ever &s;ince done me the <HI>Ho|nour</HI> of being extremely complai&s;ant.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chevalier</HI> got acquainted in <HI>Lon|don</HI> with Mrs. <HI>Smith,</HI> the Wife of an <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Merchant. She was a mo&s;t charm|ing Woman, and her Hu&s;band was ex|tremely fond. His Bu&s;ine&s;s calling him to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> he prudently &s;ettled his Af|fairs, and made his <HI>dear Wife</HI> &s;ole Execu|trix, and divided his Fortune between her and a Child. Poor Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> went off, and his tender Con&s;ort would have been incon&s;olable, had not the good-na|tur'd <HI>Fanfaron</HI> comforted her in her Af|flictions.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the <HI>Chevalier</HI> per&s;uaded her in|to a Scheme to make their Joys more compleat, and not &s;o liable to be inter|rupted by the Curio&s;ity of a <HI>Hu&s;band.</HI> He very dexterou&s;ly forg'd a Letter from the Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Leghorn</HI> to Mrs. <HI>Smith,</HI> full of kind Expre&s;&s;ions and Friend|&s;hip, and the great Difficulty he was un|der, by being oblig'd to mention the <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of &s;o <HI>worthy</HI> and good a Man as Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who took a <HI>Fever,</HI> and, in Spite of all A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the Skill of Phy&s;i|cians, died in his Arms the Ninth Day, confirming a <HI>Te&s;tament</HI> made in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>HE had now compleatly fixed <HI>Mademoi|&s;elle Fard&eacute;</HI> on his Side, yet they met at his Lodgings as u&s;ual, but more frequently in this.&mdash;The young <HI>Lady</HI> an&s;wered his Billets in a proper and polite Manner, and per|mitted him to <HI>Hope.</HI> He reply'd as polite|ly, and the Corre&s;pondence went on in the mo&s;t agreeable Manner, though he &s;ome|times thought that <HI>the Po&s;tage was rather too expen&s;ive;</HI> however, as he was &s;ure of the Lady's Affections, he judged it well be&s;towed, and waited for the I&s;&s;ue with great Patience for above Four Months.</P>

<Q><P>FEW People on Earth are ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a Fund of Spirits and <HI>natural Gaiety</HI> of Temper as the <HI>French;</HI> and yet few Nations are more crampt in the <HI>natural</HI> Exerci&s;e of it.

the <HI>Monarch</HI> with too much Freedom, but the Sign of the <HI>Holy-Gho&s;t,</HI> and all the <HI>Saints</HI> are di&s;per&s;ed through every Street. A King is always the Head of the mo&s;t childi&s;h <HI>Games,</HI> and at <HI>Cards,</HI> the Be&s;t, is honoured with that Title.&mdash; Such Principles are propagated with great Art, and the Religion of the Country admitting <HI>Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;olu|tion,</HI> an <HI>Ab&s;olute Monarch</HI> can, with Ea&s;e, direct the Current of Opinion.&mdash;Men of Learning and Judgment mu&s;t go with the Stream, for it falls from too high a Fountain to be re&s;i&s;ted, whatever their private Sentiments may be. Be&s;ides, Two or Three Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Orators</HI> well armed, will always carry Demon|&s;tration and Conviction.

<P>FRANCE has propagated the Notion of <HI>Military Honour</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, that they are become a Nation of JANISA|RIES, and perhaps mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch,&mdash;that is, they mu&s;t, <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong,</HI> be frequently employed. <HI>Com|merce</HI> and <HI>Traffick</HI> flouri&s;h in Peace.&mdash; <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Plenty, Learning</HI> and <HI>Know|ledge</HI> are the Con&s;equences, as well as <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Luxury.</HI> Men naturally be|come fond of the&s;e Sweets, and will not quietly forego them. They will find out their own <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Power.</HI> They will expect a Freedom of <HI>Action,</HI> as well as <HI>Thought,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute Monarchy</HI> will fall before them.&mdash;RICHELIEU knew this.&mdash;

He broke and divided the Power of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> not like <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England,</HI> among&s;t the People, but added <HI>all</HI> to the Dignity and Power of the <HI>Crown.</HI>&mdash;MAZARIN did the &s;ame, and LOUVOIS, FOUQUET and COLBERT com|pleated the Project, and the long Reign and Ambition of LEWIS confirmed it. The <HI>King</HI> of GREAT-BRITAIN is the Fountain of <HI>Honour;</HI> but the Monarch of this Kingdom is not only the <HI>Foun|tain</HI> of <HI>real,</HI> but the <HI>Creator</HI> of <HI>imaginary</HI> Honours.

<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h Ladies</HI> rely on their na|tive Charms, nor want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Paint</HI> to heighten their Complexions.

<P><Q>THIS, Sir, <HI>reply'd Conyers,</HI> has often &s;urpri&s;ed me, but there is another Matter, equally a&s;toni&s;hing.&mdash;I know what was formerly under&s;tood by a <HI>Nonjuror.</HI> I know that a &s;crupulous Con&s;cience might refu&s;e the Oaths to <HI>King</HI> WILLIAM, when he had before taken them to <HI>King</HI> JAMES, but I cannot conceive what a <HI>Nonjuror</HI> is in the&s;e Days.'&mdash;'And you will, &s;aid <HI>Villeneuf,</HI> be more amazed, when I tell you, he is one of tho&s;e <HI>rank Weeds</HI> that the be&s;t <HI>Land</HI> is mo&s;t &s;ubject to.

<P>ON this Subject Mr. <HI>Villeneuf</HI> gave many Hints, but <HI>Conyers</HI> prevented his enlarging too much; and, as he &s;aw his Countenance frequently change, he per&s;uaded him to lie down.&mdash;All the Morning he complained of a violent Head-Ach, and Pain in the Back. &mdash;All Precautions were taken, and the be&s;t Phy&s;icians employ'd, but all prov'd inef|fectual, for this <HI>good,</HI> this <HI>valuable</HI> young Gentleman <HI>died</HI> the fourteenth Day.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Conyers</HI> was in the utmo&s;t Affliction, for he lo&s;t his <HI>Brother,</HI> his <HI>Friend,</HI> his <HI>Ma&s;|ter,</HI> and his whole Support.&mdash;For &s;ome Time he was not able to attend his own In|tere&s;t; but the good Nature of Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> &s;har'd his Sorrows, and directed his Con|duct.

<P>CONYERS did not always dine at the &s;ame <HI>Hotel,</HI> for different Companies afforded him different Remarks. At one of the&s;e Ordi|naries, he had made a Sort of Acquaintance with a genteel young Man, of about his own Age, without inquiring into his Character. The Conver&s;ation happen'd to turn on the Folly and Ab&s;urdity of <HI>Gaming,</HI> and this Gen|tleman laid open the Subject and the Schemes of <HI>Sharpers,</HI> in &s;o clear and convincing a Manner, that charm'd <HI>Conyers.</HI>&mdash;After Din|ner, they took a Walk together, and renewed the Subject.&mdash;'Few Men, <HI>&s;aid the Stranger,</HI> under&s;tand <HI>Play</HI> better than I. Formerly I was a <HI>Bubble</HI> to it, but when I became a Ma&s;ter, and might have won back the Money I had lo&s;t, though I don't much want it, my Friends and Relations got round me, and oblig'd me to renounce <HI>Gaming</HI> for my&s;elf. I now a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;ome Friends, and but la&s;t Night I won <HI>two hundred Pieces</HI> for the Gentleman in Blue, with Gold <HI>Brandenburghs,</HI> that din'd with us.

<P>OUR Hero li&s;ten'd with great Attention, and, by his many Que&s;tions, &s;eem'd de|&s;irous to venture a &s;mall Matter, which perchance might <HI>double</HI> his Fund. The two hundred Pieces won la&s;t Night, ran &s;trangely in his Head, and his Imagination put him already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Sum. Like a <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> he went round and round, and often nibled at the Bait, till at length his eager De&s;ires &s;urmounted his Fears, and he &s;wallow'd the <HI>Hook.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Conyers</HI> propos'd vi&s;iting the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Fortune,</HI> the other made &s;ome few Difficulties, but was at la&s;t prevail'd on to lend him his Skill. In Pur&s;uance to the Plan of Operation, <HI>Conyers</HI> gave him <HI>Forty Louis,</HI> and put <HI>Twenty</HI> more into his own Pocket. It was too &s;oon to begin the Project; and, to divert the Time and rai&s;e their Spirits, the Gentleman propo&s;ed a Bottle of <HI>Champaign.</HI> They fini&s;h'd two, and <HI>Conyers</HI> found him&s;elf extremely elate,

and progno&s;ticated va&s;t good Fortune. He was like <HI>Alna&s;char</HI> the famous <HI>Gla&s;s Man,</HI> for he had rais'd his Thoughts, and built the Edifice of <HI>Grandeur,</HI> but others had the Honour of <HI>kicking</HI> it all down.</P>
<P>THEY arriv'd at the Temple, where the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> were a&s;&s;embled, and very earne&s;t at their <HI>Devotions.&mdash;Conyers</HI> was fix'd at a Table with good Company, where he won and lo&s;t, but much wonder'd his Friend did not appear and a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He grew a little unea&s;y, but when he enquir'd, the Gentle|man was not to be found, neither did any one know his Name. <HI>Conyers</HI> was unwilling to &s;u&s;pect him, and pur&s;u'd his Fortune &s;ing|ly.&mdash;As no Man knows his own Courage till he is try'd, &s;o <HI>Conyers</HI> knew not his <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion for Play,</HI> until he was at a Gaming Table.&mdash;His twenty Pieces being near ex|pir'd, he ventur'd to a&s;k, <HI>If any Gentleman would give him Credit till next Morning, in ca&s;e he lo&s;t.</HI> With great Politene&s;s they all agreed, <HI>there was no Difficulty in confiding in a Gentleman of his Appearance.</HI></P>

examine the <HI>Mythology.</HI> He now di&s;co|ver'd that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> was extremely erro|neous, for he had not only lo&s;t <HI>all</HI> his <HI>ready Money,</HI> but was indebted above <HI>Fifty Louis d'Ors.</HI>&mdash;The &s;mall Remains of the Night was not employ'd in the mo&s;t agreeable Reflections, neither was the Morning u&s;her'd in with happier Thoughts, for the Crime of la&s;t Night <HI>&s;tar'd</HI> him full in the Face, in the Shape of <HI>three Gentlemen</HI> with Demands of Money. Whil&s;t employ'd in di&s;charging the&s;e <HI>Debts</HI> of Honour, Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> enter'd, which put him in the ut|mo&s;t Confu&s;ion. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> began to imagine that his Friend had taken up the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>lending Money</HI> on <HI>Pledges,</HI> but a little of their Conver&s;ation &s;oon convinc'd him of his Error.</P>

<P>MADAM HAUGHTY had a &s;trong <HI>Lev&eacute;e</HI> almo&s;t every Morning; and, becau&s;e &s;he had been in <HI>France,</HI> and heard &s;omething of the Conduct of their Ladies of Quality, &s;he frequently received their Vi&s;its in Bed. <HI>Conyers</HI> always made the Tea, and, with a Footman, attended the Duty of the Table. One Morning, when the Company were pretty numerous, <HI>Jack</HI> was bu&s;y employ'd in this Office, but happening to go into the Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, he found a Bottle
<PB N="227" REF="234">
with a Label, on which was wrote <HI>Mouth Water;</HI> and, as his Gums were &s;well'd with a Cold, he innocently u&s;ed this Water as a Gargle. Whil&s;t he was filling out the Tea, his Lips &s;hrunk up, and his Mouth almo&s;t clos'd. The Company could not forbear &s;miling at the Oddity of his Face, which was quite di&s;torted. Madam, at la&s;t perceived the Queerne&s;s of his Phiz, and, with a Laugh, a&s;k'd him, What was the Matter? When he attempted to an&s;wer, his whole Face was in Convul&s;ions; but, as he could not articulate a Word, he ran to the Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, and produced the Bottle. <HI>Haughty</HI> bur&s;t into a violent Laugh, and whi&s;per'd a Lady near her, who com|municated the Secret to a Third, and in a Moment all pre&s;ent were in the utmo&s;t Mirth; and a thou&s;and Wittici&s;ms were thrown out, till <HI>Conyers</HI> was oblig'd to quit his Station, and &s;eek Refuge in his Cham|ber, where, with Patience and warm Wa|ter, he brought his Features to their ac|cu&s;tom'd Regularity; but it was not till &s;ome Years after, he found out what had occa&s;ion'd his Di&s;order, and the immode|rate Banter he &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>MRS. HAUGHTY carry'd her Ridicule &s;o far, that it rai&s;ed his Re&s;entment, and de|termin'd him to watch her Motions more
<PB N="228" REF="235">
narrowly. In the mean Time he could not avoid making &s;ome &s;erious Reflections on the Conduct and Situation of <HI>Lord Weakhead.</HI> He thought that the Life of a <HI>Man of Quality</HI> was to be employ'd in &s;hewing good Examples to the World; and, with &s;ome Sighs, compar'd the Beha|viour of his pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter to that of <HI>Lord True good.</HI>&mdash;He was &s;urpriz'd how a <HI>Peer</HI> could run from the Dignity his <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> had purchas'd, and act below the Character of the meane&s;t Mechanic. He was a&s;to|ni&s;h'd that a <HI>Nobleman,</HI> who might almo&s;t command the be&s;t Society, and a Lady of the fir&s;t Family, where good Sen&s;e and Ho|nour would grace his Table, &s;hould re|nounce the&s;e rational Comforts, and amu&s;e him&s;elf with the Dregs of Mankind, and a <HI>Woman</HI> of a mo&s;t abandon'd Life. He was at la&s;t convinced, that his <HI>poor Lord</HI> had all the Plagues the wor&s;t Wife could give, without any one of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures &s;he might &s;ometimes be&s;tow.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Lady</HI> hath di&s;cover'd, that Delica|cy and Tenderne&s;s were not the Charms mo&s;t admir'd by my <HI>Lord</HI> in a Mi&s;tre&s;s, but that his Con&s;titution was to be govern'd only by ab&s;olute Power. The more &s;he &s;eem'd to hate and de&s;pi&s;e him, the fonder he grew. Her in&s;olent Security was &s;uch,
<PB N="229" REF="236">
that &s;he &s;carcely made a Secret of her Infi|delity, &s;o that <HI>Conyers</HI> caught her one Morning <HI>beating Time</HI> to the Mu&s;ick of a dirty Fidler. She colour'd a little, at being &s;o fairly di&s;cover'd; but, with a matchle&s;s A&s;&s;urance, propos'd his taking a Part in the <HI>Concert. Conyers,</HI> with a Smile of Di&s;|dain, an&s;wer'd, He had too good a <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> to be charm'd with a <HI>common vulgar Ballad.</HI> Her Rage is not to be expre&s;s'd, &s;he &s;wore like an old Dragoon; and in this Temper he quitted her in Contempt.</P>
<P>AMONGST the many who paid Court to my <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Madam Haughty,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sang|froid,</HI> a young Surgeon of <HI>French</HI> Extrac|tion, was pretty con&s;tant. He had a par|ticular Regard for <HI>Conyers,</HI> and was the on|ly Per&s;on who found out his Value and Merit. <HI>Sangfroid</HI> was a Man of Sen&s;e, and who&s;e Conver&s;ation was &s;eriou&s;ly diverting, and his &s;peaking <HI>French</HI> extremely well, made <HI>Conyers</HI> fond of being often with him. To this Gentleman he told his Story, and begg'd his Advice. <Q>I &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid Sangfroid,</HI> you are not perfectly acquainted with this Part of the World. I have &s;ometimes interfered between a <HI>Gentleman</HI> and his <HI>Wife,</HI> and have made up mighty Quar|rels occa&s;ion'd by <HI>Lap-Dogs, Parrots,</HI> and the like; but I never meddle between
<PB N="230" REF="237">
a Gentleman and his <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> It is of too &s;acred and delicate a Nature, neither can my Probe &s;earch to the Bottom of the Wound; and, as I perceive that a Mortification mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity en&s;ue, why &s;hould I give my Patient unnece&s;&s;a|ry Pain? However, <HI>continued he,</HI> don't repine at being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed this Service, but live with me until I can provide you ano|ther.</Q> <HI>Conyers</HI> return'd him many Thanks, and that Evening accepted his kind Invi|tation, for my <HI>Lord</HI> very gravely paid him three Months Wages, and gave him a Di&s;|charge.</P>
<P>MR. SANGFROID received him with great Kindne&s;s, and apologiz'd for not hav|ing it in his Power to be more con&s;tantly with him, but he never fail'd at Dinner, and &s;eldom in the Evenings. In the&s;e Con|ver&s;ations <HI>Conyers</HI> took Care to ingratiate him&s;elf with his new Friend, and di&s;play'd his Learning and Accompli&s;hments in &s;o agreeable a Manner, as not a little &s;urpriz|ed the Surgeon, who confe&s;s'd he merited an happier Fate: <Q>But, <HI>continued he,</HI> it &s;hall not be my Fault, if &s;omething don't turn out to your Advantage.</Q></P>

<P>ONE Evening our Friends had agreed to go to a favourite Play, where Mr. <HI>Sangfroid</HI> met &s;everal of his Acquaintance. 'I &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid he to Conyers,</HI> a Knot of choice Spirits in the third Row; &s;hould they a&s;k me to a Tavern, I mu&s;t de&s;ire your Company; for, though it will be <HI>Time thrown away, it will not be lo&s;t.</HI>' 'I cannot, <HI>reply'd Conyers,</HI> rightly under|&s;tand your Di&s;tinction, but command me.' 'That young Gentleman, <HI>continu|ed
<PB N="232" REF="239">
the Surgeon,</HI> in a white Fu&s;tian Frock, and checquer'd Flannel Wai&s;tcoat, with the Hat of a Stage Coachman, is <HI>Sir Ni|cholas Roy&s;ter</HI> of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> who inherits good four thou&s;and Pounds a Year. He's not yet of Age, but borrows Money e|nough, by in&s;uring his Life. That <HI>eld|erly Youth</HI> ju&s;t by him, with a red Face, is <HI>Squire Mori&s;e,</HI> formerly of <HI>High Hall</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> That fine Seat, and fifteen hundred a Year round it, has been long purcha&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Punctual,</HI> a Ban|ker in the <HI>Strand,</HI> on which the Squire has two hundred a Year Life-Rent. That genteel young Man on the other Side, is one Mr. <HI>Fitz-Simons</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> where, I imagine, he has a good Fortune, for he is extremely generous. He has Cham|bers in the <HI>Middle Temple,</HI> and for the&s;e three Years has &s;tudy'd very clo&s;ely. A little beyond him you &s;ee a portly <HI>fierce</HI> Gentleman in Scarlet, with a Point <HI>d' E|&s;pagne</HI> Hat &s;o cock'd, that it frights the Orange Wenches. He is called <HI>Major Noi&s;y,</HI> and, I have been told, was for|merly a <HI>Lieutenant</HI> in the Army, but was oblig'd to &s;ell out and retire on En&s;ign's Half-pay; but the <HI>Knight</HI> is his Friend.' &mdash;'I think, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> you apply the Word <HI>fierce</HI> to the Major; now, as I ap|prehend,
<PB N="233" REF="240">
it is derived from, the <HI>French</HI> Word <HI>fier,</HI> which means <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>&s;aucy,</HI> I beg you will give him &s;ome other Epithet, for I ob&s;erve he is extremely fa|miliar with the Orange Ladies, who &s;eem to attack him with equal Freedom.'&mdash; Your Ob&s;ervation, <HI>&s;aid Sangfroid,</HI> I be|lieve is right, but really the Major is far from being <HI>proud;</HI> but how <HI>fier</HI> may an|&s;wer to <HI>&s;aucy,</HI> I hope to convince you: However, they are all my Friends and Cu&s;tomers; and the Plague of my Pro|fe&s;&s;ion is, I mu&s;t not only keep them Company, but agree to every Thing they &s;ay, when in Company.'</P>
<P>THE Play was &s;carcely fini&s;hed, when the Major gave a loud Hem, and having fix'd <HI>Sangfroid</HI>'s Eyes, call'd out, &mdash;<HI>The King's Arms,</HI> and received a Nod of Con|&s;ent.&mdash; <HI>Sir Nicholas</HI> and his Company got fir&s;t to the Tavern, having pick'd up two &s;pecial City Sparks. When Mr. <HI>Sangfroid</HI> and <HI>Conyers</HI> arriv'd, they found the <HI>Major</HI> and the re&s;t very loud at the Larder. With great Difficulty Supper was order'd, and the Ma&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Ryan,</HI> conducted them into the <HI>Ro&s;e.</HI>&mdash; As an Hi&s;torian, I am com|pell'd to attend, but, <HI>courteous Reader,</HI> if <HI>thou'rt not charm'd with Di&s;cord of har&s;h Sounds,</HI>&mdash;If a <HI>Tavern Scene</HI> delighteth not

<P>THE In&s;tant the Major enter'd the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> he cry'd out, <Q>Z&mdash;ns! what a Room has the Ra&s;cal put us into?&mdash;Here&mdash; You Son of a W&mdash;re, &s;hew us into the <HI>Rummer,</HI> this &s;mokes like Hell!</Q>&mdash;<HI>Ryan</HI> was all Obedience, and, as he conducted them back, the <HI>Knight</HI> could not avoid &s;ay|ing, <Q>Ay, ay, let the <HI>old Soldier</HI> alone; D&mdash; me he'll keep 'em all in Order.</Q>&mdash; The u&s;ual Salutations began, and Mr. <HI>Sang|froid</HI> introduced <HI>Conyers</HI> to each, by their Titles.&mdash;<Q>Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Major,</HI> give me your Hand. D&mdash;n all the&s;e Compli|ments; you &s;eem, Sir, to be a Gentle|man, and a Man of Honour, and D&mdash; me but we're all oblig'd to <HI>Young Bolus</HI> for your Company.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Conyers</HI> ju&s;t began to return the Compliment, but the Major interrupted him, &s;aying,&mdash;'Sir, You are a very pretty &s;en&s;ible Gentleman, and <HI>(ringing the Bell as loud as he could)</HI> we'll take a hearty Bottle together, and know me for your Friend.&mdash;Here&mdash;You O&s;tler &mdash;D&mdash; me, where is the Wine.'&mdash; Plea&s;e your Honour, <HI>&s;aid the Waiter,</HI> the

<P>THE Company were moving to their Places, when Mr. <HI>Mori&s;e</HI> open'd with an hoar&s;e Voice,&mdash;<Q>D&mdash;n that <HI>old Firelock,</HI> what a Clatter he makes; cur&s;e him, he'll never be a <HI>Conjurer,</HI> for he wan't born dumb.</Q>&mdash;This witty Stroke occa|&s;ion'd a prodigious Laugh, which la&s;ted with many Additions, till all had taken their Seats.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be expected I &s;hould &s;et down minutely and in Order every &s;ingle Word and Repartee during the fir&s;t half Hour's Conver&s;ation. The Ta&s;k would be too arduous even for the renown'd Author of <HI>Pamela</HI> and <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> who&s;e Patience no|thing could equal, except that of his Rea|ders. <HI>Old Bunyan</HI> would have been at a Lo&s;s, and the celebrated Mr. <HI>Cleveland</HI> would have found it impo&s;&s;ible; how there|fore can I, a <HI>weak, ignorant Modern,</HI> pre|tend to attempt what &s;uch <HI>va&s;t Geniu&s;es</HI> mu&s;t have omitted. All I am able to do,
<PB N="236" REF="243">
is to beg the <HI>learned Reader</HI> to &s;upply my Defects, by imagining, or, <HI>if he can,</HI> wri|ting about thirty Pages of the mo&s;t <HI>fa&s;hion|able Oaths,</HI> and refin'd <HI>Bawdy Jokes</HI> his Wit can put together.

<P>WHILST the Supper was laying, Mr. <HI>Sangfroid</HI> whi&s;per'd his Friend, <Q>that <HI>Sir Nicholas</HI> had pawn'd his Honour they would have no Whores in Company that Night, for I hope, <HI>added the Surgeon,</HI> to amu&s;e you in a better Manner.</Q>&mdash;Supper over, they had ju&s;t &s;et down to fre&s;h Bot|tles when Mr. <HI>Ryan</HI> enter'd. <Q>Plea&s;e your Honours, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> here's the <HI>Gazette,</HI> and great News in it, will your Honour, <HI>giving it to the Major,</HI> be pleas'd to read it, for 'tis be&s;poke in the next Room.</Q> &mdash;I read it! <HI>cry'd the Major,</HI> <Q>No, not I by G&mdash;, read it your&s;elf and be d&mdash;d.</Q>&mdash; <HI>Ryan</HI> began, and read of a <HI>powerful Squa|dron fitted out at</HI> Bre&s;t, <HI>and that forty thou|&s;and</HI> French <HI>had Orders to march to</HI> Ger|many, <HI>and the like Number to the Frontiers of</HI> Flanders. <HI>That the Queen of</HI> Hungary

Your <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> was not my Turn, and the Fool my Ma&s;ter flogg'd me damnably before he found it out, which happen'd by an odd Accident, for when I was about Fifteen, the Son of a B&mdash;h was at his old Tricks with his <HI>Birch,</HI> but d&mdash;me if I didn't take him &s;uch a Knock over the Noddle with the Poker, that down dropt Old <HI>Ars in pre&s;ente,</HI> and the be&s;t of the Joke was, that the Scoundrel was a <HI>Par&s;on.</HI> The old Ju&s;tice laugh'd heartily, and prais'd my Spirit, &s;o I thought <HI>I had him on.</HI> I wanted d&mdash;ly to get to <HI>London,</HI> but my Chap was as clo&s;e fi&s;ted as the Devil, and not a Stiver would he part with to buy me a Commi&s;|&s;ion, which was all my Pride.

<HEAD>The STORY of <HI>POLLY GUN,</HI> OTHERWISE <HI>POLLY CANNON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHO, or what were my Parents, is of no Con&s;equence, only I mu&s;t &s;ay they were People of Sub&s;tance and Reputation, and mo&s;t tenderly bred and educated me. I grew up like other Wenches; and at Fourteen, <HI>the flattering World had talk'd me into Beauty.</HI> Per|haps I really was &s;o, but am &s;ure I
<PB N="260" REF="267">
thought it. About this Time, one Mr. <HI>Tarrier,</HI> and his Lady, took a furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e in our Neighbourhood. The good Gentlewoman was mighty religious, and never fail'd at the Pari&s;h Church. She took a great Liking to my Father's Pew, and, by many little Civilities, was much regarded by our Family. She invited us to Supper, and was invited in Return. In a Word, her Conver&s;ation was &s;o pious and godly, and &s;he inveigh'd &s;o much again&s;t the Wickedne&s;s and Vices of the pre&s;ent Age, that my poor Parents be|came &s;o fond of, and intimate with her, that they intreated &s;he would be &s;o good to in&s;truct their dear <HI>Polly.</HI> I own I was not much pleas'd with my Tutore&s;s, for &s;he con&s;tantly trail'd me to Church twice a-Day. My good Mother thank'd God &s;he had found &s;o good a Friend; but I &s;oon di&s;cover'd that Madam <HI>Tarrier</HI> was not &s;o outrageou&s;ly rigid as I expected; for &s;he &s;ometimes per&s;uaded them to permit me to a Play. The pious Lady always cho&s;e a Comedy, and in &s;ome Parts, where I was ignorant of the Joke, &s;he very kindly explain'd, perhaps more than the Author meant.</P>
<P>IN this Manner we lived for about Half a Year, and the good Woman had got
<PB N="261" REF="268">
&s;uch an A&s;cendancy over my Mother, that I believe &s;he would have tru&s;ted me with her even to <HI>America.</HI> She frequent|ly took me to vi&s;it her Uncle near <HI>Gro&s;ve|nor-Square.</HI> He was a very polite, rich old Gentleman, and &s;o kind to me, that I was always &s;ure of &s;ome pretty Pre&s;ent, or a Guinea or two to buy Ribbands. At one, and the la&s;t of the&s;e Vi&s;its, Ma|dam <HI>Tarrier</HI> took the Opportunity of leaving me with her Uncle, that &s;he might attend her Devotions at a neigh|bouring Church. I thought &s;he &s;taid a little too long, and began to be impa|tient. The old Gentleman endeavoured to pa&s;s away the Time with a Chat fitting my Years, but at la&s;t I could not refrain crying mo&s;t bitterly.&mdash;What need I amu&s;e you with unnece&s;&s;ary Particulars?&mdash;The <HI>She Devil</HI> had left me with an <HI>He one,</HI> and I was undone.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Month of my Confinement, for I was con&s;tantly watch'd, was dread|ful to my Imagination. I mo&s;t affec|tionately lov'd my Father and Mother, and felt their Sufferings at the Lo&s;s of an only Child. I wept almo&s;t Day and Night, but mu&s;t &s;ay the old Gentleman was extremely tender and fond, and did all in his Power to make my Life ea&s;y.
<PB N="262" REF="269">
He bought me Books, we read by Turns, and he gave me that Sort of Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h for them, which I now find of infinite U&s;e. I play'd on the Harp|&s;ichord, and &s;ung well; but he had a Ma&s;ter to perfect me and amu&s;e my lei|&s;ure Hours. I in&s;en&s;ibly began to be better pleas'd with my Station, and in Twelve Months was quite reconciled to it.</P>
<P>WHAT an Animal is Man! &mdash; As I grew happy and fond of the Wretch, his Affections cool'd, and he entirely changed his Conduct. At la&s;t he upbrai|ded me with Infidelity (which was im|po&s;&s;ible) and proved his A&s;&s;ertions by my injuring his Health. He &s;torm'd and flew into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; and cal|ling his Man <HI>Jenkins,</HI> "Here, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> take this fair Lady, get her a Lodging and a Surgeon, which I &s;hall pay; but &s;ince &s;he has found out a <HI>Trade,</HI> all &s;he can expect of me, is to <HI>&s;et her up.</HI>"&mdash; Without giving me Time to reply, he &s;tepp'd into his Chariot and vani&s;hed. &mdash; I was &s;truck dumb; and tho' my Heart was ready to bur&s;t, no friendly Tear a&s;|&s;i&s;ted me. Poor <HI>Jenkins</HI> was in great Perplexity; but one of the Maids having pack'd up all my Linen and Cloaths, of
<PB N="263" REF="270">
which I had Abundance, and very fine, he was obliged to execute the Orders of his Ma&s;ter, and conducted me to the Door, where an Hackney Coach &s;tood ready to receive me.</P>
<P>AS I was pa&s;&s;ing the Hall, I don't know what per&s;uaded me to open the Parlour Door; but what was my A&s;to|ni&s;hment, when I &s;aw Mrs. <HI>Tarrier,</HI> and a charming young Creature, in clo&s;e Con|ver&s;ation!&mdash;I &s;tood motionle&s;s, but in Agony, and with uplifted Eyes, I ju&s;t utter'd&mdash;<HI>Infamous Woman!</HI> and fell in a Swoon.&mdash;The Servants too charitably brought me to my&s;elf, and <HI>Jenkins</HI> rather carried, than led me to the Coach.</P>
<P>WHEN we got to the Lodging he had provided for me, I flew to the Bed and abandon'd my&s;elf to Tears, Sighs, and the mo&s;t melancholy Reflections.&mdash;Good God! &s;aid I, is there no <HI>Law,</HI> no <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> for the Injuries done me? Mu&s;t I &s;uffer in Si|lence, and mu&s;t triumphant Villany go un|puni&s;hed!&mdash;Is the Nature of <HI>Woman</HI> &s;o harden'd, and the Con&s;cience of Man &s;o &s;teel'd, as not to feel the utmo&s;t Remor&s;e for this <HI>wor&s;e than Rape?</HI>&mdash;Bitter, very bitter were my Words, and <HI>Jenkins</HI> try'd all Means to a&s;&s;uage the Violence of my Pa&s;&s;ion. At length I became more calm,
<PB N="264" REF="271">
and he promi&s;ed to wait on me in the Morning. The Woman of the Hou&s;e obliged me to eat a little, and was very civil and tender.</P>
<P>NEXT Day <HI>Jenkins</HI> came and brought a Surgeon. When alone he began to que&s;tion and examine me in the delicate Manner, and then declared I was injured in a high Degree.&mdash;'Twould be tedious to mention all this Affair; let it &s;uffice, that I was perfectly recover'd in two Months.&mdash;As I could not accu&s;e my&s;elf of a real Crime, I re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to return to my Parents, not doubting but they would receive me, and revenge my Wrongs. With proper Caution I per|&s;uaded my Landlady to make &s;ome En|quiry after them; but, Good Heavens! What were my Sufferings whil&s;t &s;he gave me the following Account?&mdash;"I have done, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> what you have de&s;ir'd, and find that the Family I en|quir'd after, had a beautiful Daughter who was &s;tolen from them about a Year ago by a Bawd, who, as a Neighbour, got into their Favour, but decamp'd the Moment &s;he fini&s;hed her horrid Work. The poor Mother was &s;o griev'd at the Lo&s;s of her Child, that &s;he fell into a Decay, and died in Half a Year. The
<PB N="265" REF="272">
Father, with Difficulty, got the better of his Afflictions, but &s;old all his Effects, and went Abroad, but where I could not learn. I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, that Family are greatly pity'd by all the Neighbours."&mdash;'My Situation is not to be de&s;cribed.&mdash; Now, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the wor&s;t has happen'd.&mdash;My dear Mother is dead, &mdash;My Father gone, &mdash; and I mu&s;t be abandon'd to the Fate of a Pro&s;titute!&mdash; But what &s;ignifies what becomes of me?</P>
<P>JENKINS ju&s;t then enter'd, and, after &s;ome Chat, told me my Lodgings and Surgeon were paid; "and now, <HI>Polly,</HI> &s;aid he, your old Friend &s;ends you the&s;e Fifty Guineas, and advi&s;es you to take Care of your&s;elf."&mdash;I took the Mo|ney, but vented on the old Villain every Name, and every Imprecation my Rage could &s;ugge&s;t.&mdash;"Come, come, <HI>&s;aid Jenkins,</HI> of what U&s;e is all this? You mu&s;t now think of providing a Mainte|nance; and if you'll be advis'd by me, perhaps Things may go better than you imagine. You are certainly a fine Girl, and &s;ome Gentlemen would think them|&s;elves happy in your Acquaintance.

<P>JENKINS got me noble Lodgings pro|perly &s;ituated and gave me his In&s;truc|tions; but, like other Dealers, I gave him a Sample of the <HI>Goods.</HI> He had the Benefit of a Sub&s;criber for Six Copies, by having the Seventh <HI>Gratis.</HI> He was a notable Broker, and &s;ent many good Cu&s;tomers to my <HI>Ware-hou&s;e.</HI>&mdash;In Six Months POLLY GUN began to be famous, and my Lodgings were &s;ometimes the Scene of Quarrels and Noi&s;e, e&s;pecially at Night. In &s;hort, <HI>Di&s;graces had knock'd too frequently at my Door,</HI> and the Neigh|bourhood oblig'd me to &s;hift my Quar|ters.</P>
<P>IN three Years I believe I had thirty different Apartments, good and bad, ju&s;t as the Ballance of Trade was <HI>For</HI> or <HI>Again&s;t</HI> me. 'Tis an odd Sort of Fund, for when <HI>Stock</HI> was <HI>low,</HI> I mounted to a Second or Third Story; when <HI>high,</HI> I de&s;cended to the Fir&s;t Floor.

In this Di&s;tre&s;s my Maid per&s;uaded me to be acquainted with the Porters of two or three noted Taverns.&mdash;To the&s;e Places I was frequently &s;ent for, and now took the Name of POLLY CANNON. The Novelty of my Face, my Conver&s;ation, which was always decent, my Voice, and my Youth and Compexion, furni&s;h'd out a good or rather a bad Livelihood. The Porters were fond to promote my Intere&s;t, as I greatly promoted theirs.</P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen always charg'd a Shilling for my Chair hire to the Tavern, and another if I return'd alone to my Lodgings, tho' I was oblig'd to walk. If I got a Guinea, their Fee was a Crown, be&s;ides &s;ome other <HI>Dues,</HI> which I &s;hall not mention.

<P><PB N="268" REF="275">EVEN this Sort of Life at la&s;t fail'd me; for my Face grew too familiar, which is an unpardonable Crime among&s;t Gen|tlemen; and my biting the Porters out of their ju&s;t Poundage, and refu&s;ing &s;ome certain Compliances which they re|gard as their Prerogative, they left me to pick my Teeth in my Chamber, and ne|ver invited poor <HI>Polly Cannon</HI> to a good Supper.</P>
<P>I COULD not &s;tarve.&mdash;With &s;ome In|tere&s;t, I was inli&s;ted under the Banners of a famous Lady near <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI> Not to be too minute in my Relation, I &s;hall only &s;ay, I did tolerably well there for &s;ome Time; but a Quarrel between one of the Nymphs and I, obliged me to &s;hift the Scene, and make a Piece of the Furniture of a <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e.</HI>&mdash;As aban|don'd as I was, I could never <HI>&s;wear</HI> or <HI>drink.</HI> The Want of this la&s;t Qualifica|tion, made me &s;oon di&s;charg'd the Man|&s;ions of Drunkenne&s;s, and threw me, for Sub&s;i&s;tance, into the Arms of the <HI>Pub|lick.</HI></P>

<P>ONE Night as I took my Rounds, I touch'd a young Gentleman, and in the u&s;ual Phra&s;e, a&s;k'd for a Pint of Wine. He turn'd, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Lamp, examined me a little, and con|&s;ented.&mdash; "Perhaps, Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you are more Hungry than Dry."&mdash;On my telling him he gue&s;s'd right, he or|der'd a Supper.&mdash;Our Conver&s;ation be|came very diverting, and he was &s;o good to &s;ay, I was much above the Common. He de&s;ired my Story, and I gave it him very naturally, but concluded, that as all
<PB N="270" REF="277">
poor Girls were fertile in Invention, I much doubted if he credited my Tale.&mdash; He look'd &s;erious, but from pitying he became amorous, and pre&s;&s;ed my going to a Bagnio.&mdash;Wretched as I am, <HI>Sir, &s;aid I,</HI> I cannot do a Wilful Injury. You are happy and in Health, but I am mi|&s;erable every Way.&mdash;When he was con|vinced of the Truth of what I &s;aid, he took me in his Arms, and vowed he would never forget my Genero&s;ity.&mdash; Take, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the&s;e Five Guineas, and meet me To-morrow Morning in <HI>Somer|&s;et-Gardens.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may be &s;ure I was punctual, and indeed he was exact. In fine, he carried me to the Hou&s;e of a Surgeon, where I re|mained until his Duty was over. My Friend, who&s;e Name was <HI>Loveit,</HI> con|ducted me to a private Family, where, in a &s;hort Time, with good Living and tolerable Content of Mind, I recovered my former Spirits, my Complexion, and every Sign of Youth, for I was not yet quite One-and-Twenty.&mdash;If ever I lov'd a Man it was this dear Friend, and he merited all my Regard.</P>
<P>WITH this Gentleman I lived near three Years, and as happily as my Situa|tion could admit of. I recover'd my
<PB N="271" REF="278">
Mu&s;ick and my Ta&s;te in Books, and greatly improved in both.&mdash;One Morn|ing at Breakfa&s;t he walked about the Room, and &s;eem'd very pen&s;ive. On my enquiring the Cau&s;e, he &s;at down by me and began thus.&mdash;"I hope, my dear <HI>Polly</HI> believes I love her as I ought, but all Things mu&s;t have an End.&mdash;Don't be too much alarm'd, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> on &s;eeing my my Tears,&mdash;I &s;hall act with Honour, and to your Satisfaction. &mdash; In two Words, <HI>Polly,</HI> my Friends and my real Intere&s;t compel me to <HI>marry.</HI>"&mdash;Be happy, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> in the Choice of a Wife, and may every Ble&s;&s;ing attend you.' &mdash;'What remains for me but Di&s;pair, Anx|iety and Madne&s;s.&mdash;"Not &s;o, my dear <HI>Polly, cry'd he,</HI> for I hope a better Fate attends you. Here are <HI>One Hundred</HI> Guineas, and this Paper intitles you to an Annuity of <HI>Forty Pounds a Year.</HI> Be careful of the&s;e and be happy.</P>
<P>HIS Genero&s;ity charmed me, and by Degrees he calmed my troubled Spirits, and brought me to talk of parting with more Coolne&s;s of Temper than I po&s;&s;ibly could have imagined.&mdash;"Since we mu&s;t &s;eparate, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> take a little of my Ad|vice. My Cou&s;in, Captain <HI>Mizen,</HI> of the <HI>Superb</HI> Man of War, has &s;een and

If you con|&s;ent, I will engage a Settlement of Thirty Pounds, be&s;ides your living as you have hitherto done."&mdash;Some Con|ver&s;ation en&s;ued, and at la&s;t I accepted the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>THE Evening was u&s;hered in by a Vi&s;it from Captain <HI>Mizen,</HI> who was intro|duced by Mr. <HI>Loveit.</HI> I received them with great Re&s;pect, and made many Compliments for the Prai&s;es be&s;towed on me by my Friend.&mdash;"S'blood, &s;aid the Captain, what's all this <HI>Jawing</HI> for?

Now d'ye &s;ee, an it be too little, there's twenty Pieces more to turn the Scale.&mdash;Now, Mi&s;tre&s;s, how &s;ay you? &s;hall we make the Bargain and &s;eal Lips."&mdash;<HI>Loveit</HI> &s;miled, but I was mute.&mdash;"Well, well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> Si|lence gives Con&s;ent, &s;o Mi&s;tre&s;s, by your Leave."&mdash;He ki&s;s'd mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, and then turning to <HI>Loveit,</HI> &s;aid, &mdash; S'blood Coz, &s;he's a well built Sloop, and will carry a huge deal of Cavas;

<P>WE had much of this Sort of Con|ver&s;ation, but Mr. <HI>Loveit</HI> came to the Point, and his giving me another Annui|ty of <HI>Thirty Pounds,</HI> I own it prejudiced me greatly in Favour of Captain <HI>Mizen.</HI> A few more Words fini&s;hed this Affair, and I became the Property of this <HI>Man of War,</HI> and parted with my Friend with Love and Regret.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Mizen</HI> vi&s;ited con&s;tantly, but &s;eldom before One or Two in the Morning, and frequently <HI>Half Seas over,</HI> as he called it. 'Twas difficult to ma|nage him in this <HI>Trim;</HI> but when quite drunk, was very tame and obedient, &s;o I took Care to ply him with Port or Punch, and then <HI>he turned in</HI> with Ea&s;e. In the Morning he always begged Par|don, not in Words, but in a <HI>pecuniary</HI> Manner, that carry'd irre&s;i&s;table Per&s;ua|&s;ion. I certainly hated him, and the <HI>Re|&s;i&s;tance</HI> I always made to his Care&s;&s;es, &s;er|ved but to plague me the more with his Fondne&s;s. The Creature loved, and no <HI>Caliban</HI> could &s;hew it more.

<P>AT la&s;t my <HI>true Love went to Sea,</HI> and gave me a Reprieve for &s;ix Months. The Experience I had, made me find out the real U&s;e of Money, and re&s;olve to &s;ave as much as I could. The Captain returned with a fre&s;h Cargo of that Com|modity which his Love made le&s;s valu|able. He was &s;o generous, that I &s;uffer|ed his Embraces with great Freedom, but di&s;covered the lucky Secret, that this was the only Chance I had of lo&s;ing his va|liant Heart. It &s;eems he loved a &s;mart Engagement, and a Ship that would take <HI>a good Deal of Drubbing</HI> before &s;he &s;truck. An ea&s;y Conque&s;t was to him of no Va|lue. With this Knowledge I pretended extreme Fondne&s;s; I hung on his Neck; I ki&s;s'd his Carbuncled Cheeks, and al|mo&s;t cryed when he left me. He &s;eem|ed plea&s;ed enough with my Behaviour, but his Vi&s;its were le&s;s frequent, and in &s;ix Months he forfeited his Articles, gave me the Good-bye, and <HI>left me like a Turtle all alone, to weep and mourn the Ab&s;ence of her Mate.</HI></P>

<P>CARELESS &s;ometimes met one of the&s;e Gentlemen in my Chamber, but &s;eem'd quite indifferent about it. The Indolence of his Temper was &s;uch, that no jealous Thoughts had Power to give him Unea|&s;ine&s;s.

<P>I OWN he flung me more by his Indif|ference, than had he &s;torm'd and &s;wore.
