<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Virtues, U&s;e, Do&s;e, and won|derful manner of Operation OF THE <HI>Pilulae Polychre&s;tae.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS there &s;eems no Nece&s;&s;ity to in|dicate to the Reader the Signs and Cau&s;es of tho&s;e dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es that are mo&s;t certainly and &s;afely cured by the <HI>Pilulae Polychre&s;tae,</HI> (for <HI>Non Eloquenti&acirc; &s;ed remediis curantur morbi,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> that Pri|vy-Councellor to Nature) &s;o we thought it
<PB N="4" REF="3">better to be potent in Fact than only to ap|pear pui&s;&s;ant in Words, (as do the Generality of our modern Doctors) and to relieve Per&s;ons under exqui&s;ite Pain, than to divert our Rea|der with Conclu&s;ions drawn from Topicks grounded on fundamental Truths or e&s;&s;ential Verities: Expect not therefore to meet with many profound Philo&s;ophical Hypothe&s;is's, or that I &s;hould prove the ab&s;truce Principles, or real Grounds of Sympathy, or concupi&s;cible At|traction and Coition; nor with Mathematical Demon&s;trations, which I mention la&s;t, becau&s;e I think the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>It is enough, (at lea&s;t for a time) that we have made known (for univer&s;al Good) &s;uch a <HI>Polichre&s;tick,</HI> or Sovereign Medicine, as one o|perating Con&s;imilar to it can't be produced by any Doctor, Chymi&s;t, or Apothecary in <HI>Great Britain:</HI> Yea, and &s;uch a one as will extirpate tho&s;e Hydra's of Di&s;ea&s;es undermentioned, which have for &s;o many Ages bid Defiance to the mo&s;t eminent and &s;age Phy&s;icians. Let not this &s;eem a bold and emperical A&s;&s;ertion, but &s;u&s;pend your Verdict till you have peru&s;ed the following Account; which before we pro|ceed to give, it will be requi&s;ite to tell you, that the Author has u&s;ed them with admirable yea almo&s;t incredible Succe&s;s, above the&s;e Thir|ty Three Years, not only in this Metropolis, but in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and tho' he &s;eldom admini&s;tred them to any but &s;uch as were (by the able&s;t Phy&s;icians) pronounced in|curable, and had langui&s;hed under their Mi&s;|fortunes, &s;ome Three, &s;ome Seven, &s;ome Ten and &s;ome Twenty Years, yet there were none,
<PB N="5" REF="4">tho' their Ca&s;es were never &s;o complicated, or of never &s;o long Continuance, but were in the Space of one Month (at mo&s;t) re&s;tored (by the help of the&s;e Pills) to a perfect State of Health. And tho' I could nominate above a hundred ex|traordinary and almo&s;t incredible Cures per|formed by them, (to many of which &s;ome of our eminent Doctors now in being are no Stran|gers) yet I decline it, and refer the Matter to Experience, which is the only true Examen or <HI>Lydian</HI> Touch-&s;tone, to di&s;tingui&s;h Truth from Fal&s;ity, and matter of Fact from &s;purious and odible Impo&s;ture.</P>

<P N="9">9thly. Ob&s;tructions in the Liver and Spleen, and <HI>Ductus Biliarius,</HI> or Gall Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. Heat and Hardne&s;s of the Liver, which u&s;ually cau&s;es the Jaundies, both yellow and black, and a &s;chirrhus or &s;tony Hardne&s;s of the Liver, generally thought incurable; and indeed if the Patient hath been a hard Drinker and in Years; if likewi&s;e the Di&s;temper has been of long Continuance, it may be concluded &s;o; but if none of the&s;e Three Circum&s;tances occur, the&s;e Pills have been found experimen|tally to re&s;tore the Liver to its proper Function. They al&s;o perfectly cure the black and yellow Jaundies.</P>
<P N="11">11thly. Drop&s;ies of all Sorts, whether A&s;cites, Ana&s;arcites, or Tympanities, which is a Drop|&s;y of the Womb, or that Di&s;ea&s;e which in out|ward Appearance Symboli&s;eth with it, the Tumor of the Ovarium, (as &s;ome Doctors call it) whether from Wind or Water, or both: But as the Tympany of the Womb, always pro|ceeds from Wind, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to cure it by Purges, the more you exhibit the wor&s;e they are; neither by Tapping, after which I don't remember one to have lived above 14 Days.</P>
<P N="12">12thly. The Gout, provided it be neither Nodo&s;e nor Cretaceous, that is, if it be ac|companied with neither Knots, nor Chalky Concretions in the Joynts: And one Do&s;e taken Spring and Fall perfectly prevents its returning

<P N="14">14thly, The Pal&s;y, whether of any particu|lar Part or Member of the Body, or univer|&s;al all over; whether with a Tremor or trem|bling, or numb or dead, (as it is called): pro|vided they have been neither Vomited, Pur|ged, nor Cly&s;tered; much le&s;s Blooded, Bli&s;|tered, or Cupped. Provided al&s;o that the Pa|tient be of a Plethoric, or full habit of Body, not Thin, Meagre, or Lean, Old, or Super|annuated; or that the Pal&s;y hath not &s;u|pervened &s;ome preceding Di&s;temper, as a Fever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then the&s;e Pills will certainly re&s;tore the Members to their Pri&s;tine Strength, and the Patient to perfect Health.</P>
<P N="15">15thly, All hardne&s;s with Exten&s;ion or &s;wel|ling of the Peritonaeum, and Belly, not only a|bout the Navel, but between that and the Pit of the Stomach, accompany'd with pain and difficulty of bending the Body downwards: Which in Men, hath by many Doctors been taken for a Drop&s;y, (as they do a Tympany of the Womb) and handled with the like Succe&s;s.
<PB N="9" REF="8">Several other Ca&s;es I could mention, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing belief, attended with &s;uch Symptoms as the Doctors could neither tell what to call, nor how to manage; which perhaps we may take occa&s;ion to in&s;ert in the next Edition of the&s;e Directions. This only will I add, as a general Rule, that in all Cronic and Complicated Ca&s;es, if the Party hath &s;tore of Fluids, the&s;e Pills are never given without the de&s;ired Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I have by by this time ('tis &s;uppos'd) a little &s;tartled you, by citing &s;uch a Scroll or Cata|logue of direful Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Gout it &s;elf, which for many Ages hath with&s;tood the force of all Medicines that could be oppo&s;ed, by the mo&s;t learned Academicks; I &s;ay, no doubt but you'll wonder, that they &s;hould be eradicated by a Do&s;e or Two, of one only Medicine; but we boldly and openly bid defiance to all the <HI>Ae&s;culapian</HI> Tribe in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to pro|duce a Medicine operating like this, the &s;ub|&s;equent Account of which will probably put the matter out of all Di&s;pute, and to your en|tire Satisfaction.</P>

<PB N="10" REF="9">
<HEAD>Their manner of Operation, and the Method of ordering the Patient.</HEAD>
<P>A Convenient Room with a Fire in it, be|ing provided, and Two Per&s;ons to at|tend, let the Patient go into a warmed Bed, at Eight a Clock in the Evening (or any o|ther time in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity) put at the &s;ame time a blade or two of Mace and an upper Cru&s;t of Bread, into a Pint of Ale, and cover it up clo&s;e: Which done, give him the Pills in the Pulp of a roa&s;ted Apple, (which is the be&s;t) or a Wafer moi&s;tened with Water or Canary, drinking nothing either with, or after them; then compo&s;ing him&s;elf, he will pre&s;ently be a Sleep, and continue &s;o Four Hours, and no longer; during which time he will &s;weat mo&s;t powerfully, and care mu&s;t be had neither to wipe the Sweat off his Face, nor do any thing el&s;e to di&s;turb him. The Four Hours being expired, and the Patient awake, let two Peo|ple rub him dry with hot Cloaths, and put on him a clean hot Shirt and Gown; then bring him to the Fire, and let him eat a Mor&s;el of the Bread, and &s;ip &s;ome of the Mace Ale made very hot, and well &s;weetned with &s;ingle re|fined Loaf-Sugar; when he hath done this, and drank the remaining part of the Ale, Sweating will immediately cea&s;e, which is <HI>&egrave; diametro,</HI> or directly contrary to all the Su|dorifics or Sweating Medicines now in u&s;e.
<PB N="11" REF="10">Pre&s;ently after they work plentifully by Urine, (which when cold, in &s;ome Ca&s;es and Con|&s;titutions may be cut with a Knife as Size.) To &s;ee the Contents of which, a clean White-Ware Chamber-Pot mu&s;t be in a readine&s;s, for they clean&s;e the Kidnies and Ureters of a|bundance of Stones, Sand, Slime, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if any be lodged there: When he has been up be|twixt a quarter and half an Hour, let him re|pair to Bed again, it being turned and well warmed, or another well &s;ea&s;oned put in its place, the Sheets and Blankets likewi&s;e being changed, and others well heated put on; then the Pills begin to work &s;trongly, by breaking Wind downwards, to his own and the by|&s;tanders great &s;urprize.</P>
<P>The Patient mu&s;t neither eat nor drink any thing till Dinner, if he can fa&s;t &s;o long; if he can't, a Mor&s;el of Bread, and a quarter of a Pint of hot Ale, &s;weetened with &s;ingle refined Loaf-Sugar may be taken. Let his Dinner be hot, but neither of baked, fryed, nor frigofy'd Meat, his drink al&s;o mu&s;t be hot, and I forbid Wines of all &s;ort, during the whole cour&s;e of the&s;e Operations, and 24 Hours after they all cea&s;e, and it would be better if nece&s;&s;ity would permit to forbear Wine for 24 Hours before the Pills are taken.</P>
<P>About two Hours after Dinner they begin to work downwards by Stool, except the Pa|tient has Ob&s;tructions in the Liver, Kidneys, Lacteals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or a Tympany of the Womb, or that Di&s;temper which the Doctors call a Tu|mor of the <HI>Ovarium;</HI> in all which ca&s;es, and
<PB N="12" REF="11">&s;ome others, the working by Stool is intro|duced by one large but ea&s;y Vomit; without any previous Nau&s;ea, or Sickne&s;s which brings up none of the Meat with it. During the time they Purge, which is without any Sick|ne&s;s or Gripes, the Patient mu&s;t by no means &s;top a Motion, or expo&s;e him&s;elf to any cold or damp Air, or place; neither (except in Ca&s;es of extream Thir&s;t, which I never knew to happen) mu&s;t he drink any thing; but if Thir&s;tine&s;s urge, a little Tea, made of good Juniper-berries, and &s;weetned with &s;ingle re|fined Loaf-Sugar, may be drank.</P>
<P>About an Hour and half, or two Hours at mo&s;t, after Supper (which mu&s;t be hot,) the Patient mu&s;t go to a well warmed Bed; and the Pills taken the Night before, will repeat their Operations &s;ucce&s;&s;ively as at fir&s;t, but in a much weaker degree: So that &s;ometimes there is no occa&s;ion either to rub the Party or change his Linnen. In &s;ome Ca&s;es and Con|&s;titutions, the fir&s;t Do&s;e will work 2 or 3 Nights and Days, and the &s;econd Do&s;e 3 or 4, e&s;pecially in hot Weather, or Summer Time; and then there mu&s;t be an Intermi&s;&s;ion of 2 or 3 Days before the Third Do&s;e be taken; but two Do&s;es commonly perform the Cure, be the Ca&s;e never &s;o Chronic and Complicated: In all my 33 Years Practice and upward, I ne|ver knew but one Patient that had Occa&s;ion for the Third Do&s;e; who&s;e Ca&s;e and many others very wonderful, &s;hall in another E&s;&s;ay be fully related.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>Indeed their manner of Operation is &s;o particular and extraordinary, that I almo&s;t think it hath &s;carce been parallell'd in any Age; for tho' they work mo&s;t powerfully by all the Emunctories, yet they are &s;o gentle and agreeable to Nature, that &s;he is not only exceedingly refre&s;h'd by them afterwards; but even plea&s;s'd with the &s;eeming Di&s;tur|bance they give her. Hence 'tis no wonder that the&s;e <HI>Pilulae Polychre&s;tae,</HI> &s;hould extirpate &s;o many dreadful Di&s;ea&s;es in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
