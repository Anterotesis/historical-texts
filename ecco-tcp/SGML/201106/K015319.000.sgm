<HEAD>THE TRUE METHOD OF REDUCING RUPTURES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_MY Tru&s;s is only intended for the benefit of &s;uch Ruptures in the Groin and Scrotum as there is a po&s;|&s;ibility of returning again into the Abdomen; tho' I make others of a different con&s;truction, according to the &s;ituation of the part from whence it proceeds, and other circum&s;tances that may attend it; and in particular a new in|vented Ela&s;tic Bandage for a Rupture in the Navel; for the invention of which I am in part obliged to Dr. ALLEN, of <HI>Dalwich College.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I give any directions how to apply my Tru&s;s, it may be proper to &s;ay &s;omething
<PB N="2" REF="5">with regard to the &s;afe&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t manner of reducing the Inte&s;tine, when fallen down; and the following is the method I have always practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I MUST too premi&s;e, that I have &s;ome hopes my Readers will not entertain a le&s;s favoura|ble Opinion of me, if I avoid the pompo&s;ity of &s;ome per&s;ons who have wrote on this &s;ub|ject; if I do not endeavour to rai&s;e my merit on the &s;ound of a word, and torture language for new-fangled and varying names, merely becau&s;e the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;order are triflingly different.</P>
<P>IF the Rupture then be much enlarged, or painful, it will be of great &s;ervice to the Pa|tient, before the reduction is attempted, to take a gentle cooling purgative, &s;uch as a de|coction of Tamarinds with Sena, or a &s;olution of Salts and Manna; and if he is of a plethoric or full habit of body, to let a moderate quan|tity of blood will be proper; and at the &s;ame time the parts &s;hould be fomented with a piece of flannel wrung out of a warm decoction of emollient herbs, &s;uch as Chamomile Flowers, Mallows, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>AFTER the&s;e preparations, you &s;hould pro|ceed in the following manner: Lay the Pa|tient upon his back in &s;uch a po&s;ture that his Buttocks may be con&s;iderably higher than his Head, as by that means the Bowels that are within the Belly will fall more towards the Brea&s;t, and not only give way to what is to be returned, but be of &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the reduction. Then you mu&s;t examine care|fully as to the &s;ituation of the Te&s;ticles; and if you find they are forced up towards the &s;ides of the Scrotum by the &s;ize of the Rup|ture, you mu&s;t be very cautious not to &s;queeze them in your attempt. If you find them compre&s;&s;ed at the bottom of the Scro|tum, you mu&s;t with the fore-finger and thumb of one hand &s;eparate them from the ruptured part, and with the &s;ame fingers of the other hand take hold of the upper part that is next the Ring of the Mu&s;cles, or place from whence the Rupture comes out, and work it gently in, in the &s;ame manner as you ob&s;erve Women do with a cow's teats when they milk her. By ob&s;erving this me|thod you will never be apt to &s;train the Rings of the Mu&s;cles, nor hurt the Inte&s;tine, &s;o as to occa&s;ion an inflammation of any of the&s;e parts.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<P>As to the application of the Tru&s;s, it will be more convenient to put it &s;lack round the Patient's Body before he is laid down, as by his getting up after the reduction there might be &s;ome ri&s;que of the Bowel falling down again. Take hold of each end of the &s;pring, and open it wide enough to receive his Body &s;ide-ways; and after you have got the Bowel fairly reduced, apply the Cu&s;hion of the Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s upon the Rings or Orifice from whence the Bowel came out. It mu&s;t have a gentle hold of the upper part of the Os Pubis or Sharebone; but take care it is not placed too high or too low: The Spring will be a direction, which &s;hould come round the Os Ilium, and clo&s;e to the juncture of the Thigh-bones, and touch the Rump ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here the clift of the Buttocks begins; which parts are called by the Anatomi&s;ts, the Great Trochanter of the Thigh-bones, and the middle of the Os Sacrum. The Tru&s;s mu&s;t be made &s;o tight as to make it &s;it clo&s;e, otherwi&s;e it will neither do its office, nor be ea&s;y to the wearer.</P>
<P>ALWAYS keep under the Cu&s;hion four fold of old coar&s;e linnen, which will keep the part cool and ea&s;y, and prevent the Cu&s;hion from being &s;poiled by the moi&s;ture of the
<PB N="5" REF="8">Skin. It will be a great addition to the Tru&s;s, if for &s;ix or &s;even weeks, or longer (that is to &s;ay, till the Patient has compleated his cure, which, if he has youth on his &s;ide, may po&s;&s;i|bly be in two months; of which, indeed, I have &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances, but then the Patient has been very ob&s;ervant of the rules pre&s;cribed him) the parts are bathed with very cold wa|ter every night and morning, which may be done conveniently in the following manner: Take a piece of large linen cloth, fold it up pretty thick &s;o as to be about &s;ix or &s;even in|ches &s;quare, a few &s;titches may be put into it to keep the folds together; dip it into a ba&s;on of cold water, (but, that you may not wet the Tru&s;s, loo&s;e it, and lay the Pad or Cu&s;hion that was in the Groin up to the Navel out of the way of the water) then &s;queeze and apply it to the Scrotum and Groin, and as it lo&s;es its cold|ne&s;s dip it in the water again and again, which &s;hould be continued for half an hour at a time: It is mo&s;t convenient this cold bathing &s;hould be performed when the Patient is naked in bed. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the Patient's breeches &s;hould be very long in the Thighs, &s;o as to al|low the wai&s;tband to come high up on the Pel|vices above the Tru&s;s, for if it bear thereon it
<PB N="6" REF="9">will add &s;o much to the pre&s;&s;ure, which will make it very unea&s;y.</P>
<P>I MUST here advi&s;e my Reader, that in ex|amining any thing like a Rupture, he does not mi&s;take a Swelling of the Spermatic Chord, or in the Groin, for one; as by handling any thing of that kind roughly, he may not only give the Patient an exqui&s;ite deal of pain, but do great mi&s;chief. If it is really a Rupture, gentle means, without being in too great a hurry, will an&s;wer be&s;t. A very gentle pre&s;|&s;ure of the Fingers in an erect po&s;ture will &s;ometimes cau&s;e it to di&s;appear: But if this &s;hold fail, lay your Patient on his Back; then rub your Fingers upwards and downwards ob|liquely from the Os Ilium to the Os Pubis. This is to be continued for a con&s;iderable time; but if it &s;hould not remove it, and it &s;till continues to the touch as at fir&s;t, the Pa|tient mu&s;t continue in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and have the part fomented, and the above opera|tion again performed: After which, &s;hould it &s;till continue hard, it is certainly no Rupture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When a Surgeon mea&s;ures a Patient for a Tru&s;s, he is to take it round very clo&s;e to the juncture of the Thigh-bone to the Os Ilium, which is the proper place for the Tru&s;s to be wore; then &s;ending the number of in|ches that the mea&s;ure contains to the Tru&s;s-maker, he never can make an error; but he mu&s;t, too, be in|formed on which &s;ide the Rupture is; whether it is double, or whether it is only in the Groin, or in both Groins, &s;o as to de&s;cend as low on one &s;ide as the Te&s;ti|cles.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<P>I HAVE been frequently &s;hocked at the cruelty with which I have &s;een Surgeons u&s;e their Patients, merely by mi&s;taking a Swel|ling for a Rupture.&mdash;On the&s;e occa&s;ions I have remon&s;trated;&mdash;but as I was not bred a Surgeon, my coun&s;el was treated with con|tempt, altho' they quickly found their at|tempts in that way were in vain.</P>
<P>IT may not here be improper to ob&s;erve, that my knowledge in the&s;e matters took its fir&s;t ri&s;e from being afflicted with a Rupture my&s;elf. I tried all the different kinds of Tru&s;&s;es that have been u&s;ed and recommended by Surgeons for many years back, but found the be&s;t of them &s;ubject to &s;ome inconveniency. However, as I was originally a Mechanic, I went to work with an intention to avoid the inconveniencies of tho&s;e I had u&s;ed; and after trying &s;everal different new forms, I at la&s;t hit upon that which I now offer to the Public, and has given &s;o much &s;atisfaction to all who have u&s;ed it. As to any farther knowledge
<PB N="8" REF="11">I have of Ruptures, I am obliged to &s;ome Gen|tlemen of the Faculty, particularly Dr. Hun|ter and Dr. Living&s;ton; al&s;o to Dr. Barry, for the books he recommended to my peru&s;al. When put you in mind how ridiculous the Surgeons of former times appear in this more enlightened age, in having rejected <HI>Frere Jaques</HI>'s new method of Cutting for the Stone, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he was not a regular bred Surgeon, I hope no Gen|tleman of the Faculty will condemn my Tru&s;s, till he can prove its having any deficiency, and has compared it very narrowly with others that continue in u&s;e. The recommendation of tho&s;e who have experienced its benefit (which &s;ome thou&s;ands in the dominions of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and Por|tugal, have done) would perhaps be &s;uffi|cient, but that many people who are &s;ubject to any di&s;order of that kind are fond of con|cealing it, and con&s;equently will never mention any thing of my Tru&s;s. However, in my be|ing con&s;tituted Tru&s;s-Maker to his Maje&s;ty's Royal Ho&s;pital at Greenwich; even when Mr. Alexander Reid, fir&s;t Surgeon's Mate of Chel|&s;ea Ho&s;pital; Mr. William Blackey, of the College of Surgeons at Paris; and Mr. Ed|di&s;on, <HI>Bed&s;tead-Maker,</HI> of Hanover-Street,
<PB N="9" REF="12">Long-Acre, with a letter of recommenda|tion &s;igned by a great number of <HI>regular-bred</HI> Surgeons, (among&s;t whom I wi&s;h Mr. Haw|kins had not been one) &s;ome of them too the mo&s;t eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion in Tru&s;&s;es in Lon|don; were candidates in oppo&s;ition to me, can|not fail to give the Public a ju&s;t idea ofits merit. The&s;e gentlemen, it is well known, did &s;tand a fair trial with me every day, almo&s;t for two months, before the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons of the Royal Ho&s;pital made their report of the candidates different merits; on which I was ap|pointed Ela&s;tic Tru&s;s-maker by the Honorable Board of Directors of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I THINK it would be here an unpardonable offence to po&s;terity, not to inform my Read|ers, that to this day a Surgeon of the greate&s;t eminence recommends a <HI>Shoemaker.</HI> to all his Ruptured Patients to make the Tru&s;&s;es for them, though I am very certain he does not know iron from &s;teel, when it is made out of the common &s;izes of the bars thereof. This I have from jobbing-&s;miths, &s;ome of whom the &s;eller has employed ever &s;ince he was con|verted from a <HI>Shoemaker</HI> into a Tru&s;s-maker. It is this <HI>eminent Surgeon</HI> and this <HI>Shoemaker</HI> that Coun&s;ellor Brand, at May's Hill, Green|wich,
<PB N="10" REF="13">means in his letter therefrom to me, which is hereafter in&s;erted for the u&s;e of the public, among&s;t others &s;ent me, together with Certificates of the Efficacy of my Tru&s;&s;es above all others made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after I had invented my Ela&s;tic Tru&s;s, I had an opportunity of &s;ending &s;ome of them to Mr. Ranby, Principal Serjeant-Surgeon to his Maje&s;ty; in con&s;equence of which I received the following letter.</P>

<P>I HUMBLY beg leave to repre&s;ent to you, that Ruptures are unfortunately too com|mon: Perhaps the fourth part of mankind labour under them in old age; and as to women who have had children, if half of them e&s;cape accidents of this kind, it is a miracle.</P>

<P>THE great advantages which my Tru&s;&s;es have, in con&s;equence of this Improvement, above others, are as follow:</P>
<P>FIRST, by an Ela&s;tic Spring, peculiar to them&s;elves, they are accommodated equally well to per&s;ons of every Age and Size; &s;o that two different Sizes is the only requi&s;ite for making them fit every per&s;on of above two years of age; and the &s;ame circum&s;tance likewi&s;e makes them more proper for exportation than any hitherto invented.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, They do not require that trouble&s;ome and incommodious appendage a Thigh-&s;trap, &s;o commonly u&s;ed in other Bandages.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, They by the Ela&s;ticity above|mentioned maintain a con&s;tant, equal, and uniform pre&s;&s;ure on the part only affected, and imitate the kind pre&s;&s;ure of the Hand in all its degrees, in all the different atti|tudes of the Body; whereby the parts mak|ing the Rupture are &s;o con&s;tantly kept from coming down, that an opportunity is given to the relaxed and ruptured parts through
<PB N="16" REF="19">which they de&s;cend to recover their former &s;tate, and thereby prove to the Patient a radical Cure.</P>
<P>FOUR THLY, I can afford to &s;ell the above|mentioned Tru&s;&s;es at as low a price as the other Tru&s;s-makers in Britain &s;ell their Iron Tru&s;&s;es, without any other property to them than dignifying them with the names of Steel and Spring Tru&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THESE, and other advantages, too te|dious to mention, convince me that this im|provement, when generally known, will prove a very great benefit to a very great part of mankind: And therefore I per&s;uade my&s;elf that &s;hould it meet with your appro|bation, I &s;hall not fail of &s;haring that encou|ragement and genero&s;ity which &s;o highly dig|nifies your honourable Society.</P>

<P>HAVING received &s;everal letters containing the mo&s;t illiberal abu&s;e, in con&s;equence of the publication of the preced|ing pages, &s;ome of which I have rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e were written by Coun&s;ellor Brand's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 20.</NOTE> <HI>Surgeon of Character;</HI> I think it nece&s;&s;ary to declare, that I never intended, nor, indeed, could I form an idea, that the Treati&s;e in que&s;tion &s;hould give the &s;malle&s;t offence to any Gentle|man of the Faculty. My &s;ole object was&mdash;the relief of my fellow-creatures, and the in&s;truc|tion of the ignorant in that which it is nece&s;|&s;ary they &s;hould know.&mdash;Be&s;ides improv|ing their practice, I have a right to the thanks of the Faculty, for pointing out the mo&s;t ef|ficacious cure of a Malady, from which <HI>they</HI> are by no means exempt&mdash;and which the mo&s;t eminent of them have had no little trouble to remove.&mdash;And I &s;incerely wi&s;h I could not &s;ay with truth, that numbers have, within the&s;e few years, lo&s;t their lives, after having paid very con&s;iderable &s;ums for pretended a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, and ineffectual advice. It is intere&s;t,
<PB N="30" REF="33">then, alone that prevents the&s;e cavillers from doing ju&s;tice to my performances, and which prompts them to cheat the di&s;ordered of a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with Surgeons who have been many years in practice, and who have a&s;|&s;ured me they never had an opportunity of reducing a Rupture, or of applying a Tru&s;s.&mdash;A midwife, too, who has been up|wards of twenty years in practice, lately de|clared to me, that, to her knowledge, &s;he ne|ver had delivered a woman that had a Rup|ture either in the Groin or Navel.&mdash;Yet have I applied Bandages on a variety of both.&mdash;</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the <HI>true method</HI> of ap|plying Tru&s;&s;es, or <HI>reducing Ruptures,</HI> is a mat|ter of the utmo&s;t importance in the treatment of that malady, and in the highe&s;t degree con|ducive to the ea&s;e of the Patient, I am bold to &s;ay, that in all the treati&s;es I have peru&s;ed, both antient and modern (and they are not a few), I never met with any thing like a clear in&s;truc|tion to that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Something <HI>curious,</HI> tho' by no means advantageous, may be col|lected from a book lately publi&s;hed.&mdash;(The Author, I think, dignifies his name with,
<PB N="31" REF="34"><Q>"Ma&s;ter of Arts and Surgery, Member of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, Demon&s;trator in the School of St. Come, Surgeon for Ruptures of the Ho&s;pitals of Hotel Dieu, the Invalids and Incurables, of the City of Paris, and of all the military Ho&s;pitals in France.")</Q> A proce&s;s is there advi&s;ed for making an ointment of a &s;olution of Gold Pearls, to be u&s;ed for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the reduction of &s;trangulated Ruptures.&mdash;When this ingenious and mo&s;t expen&s;ive pre|paration is compleated, it will probably be as efficacious as the &s;ame quantity of clay, in the &s;ame manner applied.</P>
<P>I HOPED in the treati&s;es above hinted at, to have found &s;omething that would, at lea&s;t, have been capable of improvement in the true method of applying Tru&s;&s;es, and the reducing Ruptures:&mdash;On the contrary, they contain merely long and un&s;atisfactory details of the manner in which the antient Surgeons com|monly burnt the Ruptures of their Patients, and de&s;troyed the fle&s;h of tho&s;e parts to the Bone, with a view of avoiding the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary application of Tru&s;&s;es.&mdash;This is one proof, among many, that Surgeons never en|couraged Tru&s;&s;es, altho' it is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged
<PB N="32" REF="35">that it is impo&s;&s;ible a cure can be perfectly obtained without &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tant.&mdash;The pain attending the wearing of &s;ome Tru&s;&s;es, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, has pre|vented many per&s;ons from adhering to the mo&s;t &s;alutary method of cure; but &s;uch neg|lect is often attended with the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences; it being no uncommon thing to meet per&s;ons in the &s;treet, who&s;e Guts partly falling into their breeches, exhibit a deplorable and pitiable &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>AND here it may not be improper to inform the Reader of the encouragement I received from the Faculty on my arrival in London, which was in June, 1764. Mr. Ranby being the only gentleman of the profe&s;&s;ion I had the honour of knowing, I waited upon him; and, by his de&s;ire, afterwards attended the Gentlemen of St. George's Ho&s;pital. With the countenance of &s;uch a Gentleman as Mr. Ranby, who&s;e name and letter to me at Aberdeen I had the liberty to u&s;e, I could not but form the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes of convin|cing &s;ome of the fir&s;t Surgeons in England of the merit and utility of my Tru&s;&s;es.&mdash;But I was di&s;appointed: I found, tho' they were men of learning, they were not men of can|dor.
<PB N="33" REF="36">&mdash;Mr. Bromfield &s;aid, <Q>"he believed they <HI>might do."</HI></Q> Mr. Gataker &s;aid, <Q>"he could &s;ee nothing more in <HI>my</HI> Tru&s;&s;es than in <HI>any</HI><HI> other."</HI></Q> However, while I was one day at|tending a per&s;on, then under the care of Mr. Hawkins, he informed me that he had long been an Out-patient of that Ho&s;pital, and had Tru&s;&s;es from every Tru&s;s-maker in Town, but that none of them would keep his Rup|ture up; and that &s;ince he had been under Mr. Hawkins's care, he had procured him a Tru&s;s from a per&s;on in Bartholomew Clo&s;e, which would by no means keep up his Rupture, tho' he had been to the maker twenty times to have it altered, who told him his Rupture would never be well 'till he had it cut. I looked upon this as an opportunity, offered me by Providence, of at once doing a &s;ervice to a fel|low-creature, and bringing conviction of the u&s;e of my Ela&s;tic Tru&s;&s;es to tho&s;e who had ignorantly or intere&s;tedly denied their merits. I brought the youth to my lodgings, and there applied a Tru&s;s on him; my hone&s;t endea|vours had the de&s;ired effect; and in about three months, he obtained a compleat cure.</P>
<P>LEST any of my Readers &s;hould doubt the truth of this relation, I de&s;ire to inform
<PB N="34" REF="37">them that the name of the above-mentioned youth is John Peller&s;t, who&s;e uncle, of the &s;ame name, lives in Downe-&s;treet, near Hyde-Park Corner; and I believe that &s;omething relative to this affair will be found in the books of St. George's Ho&s;pital, from the beginning of April 1764, to the end of Augu&s;t in the &s;ame year.&mdash;To this ca&s;e I have only to add, that notwith&s;tanding this ample proof of the merits of my Tru&s;s, I cannot charge Mr. Hawkins with recommending a &s;ingle Patient to me, tho' he has often confe&s;&s;ed my Tru&s;&s;es were more efficacious than tho&s;e of any other per&s;on he had knowledge of.</P>
<P>IN Mr. Pott's Treati&s;e on Ruptures, &s;econd Edition, Sec. 1. Page 29, that gentleman &s;ays, <Q>"The cure of a Rupture is either perfect (called al&s;o radical) or imperfect, which is called palliative. This di&s;tinction, which, he &s;ays, is ju&s;t and true, and founded both on rea&s;on and experience, has frequently been mi&s;un|der&s;tood by the generality of mankind, and has therefore been the cau&s;e of much unde&s;erving cen&s;ure on the practitioners of Surgery."</Q> He adds, <Q>"the truth is, that tho' the events are extremely different, yet the chirurgical means which are made u&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="38">of in either ca&s;e are exactly the &s;ame, viz. the reduction of the protruded parts, and re|tention of them when &s;o reduced by proper Bandages."</Q>&mdash;I wi&s;h Mr. Pott had given the addre&s;s of his <HI>proper Bandage-maker,</HI> as Dr. Smellie did of his proper Midwifery In|&s;trument-maker. I could never find tho&s;e Bandages at the <HI>Shoemaker</HI>'s, nor at the RUP|TURE-CURER'S, who has his name di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Court and City Regi&s;ter for 1771.&mdash;Convinced at lea&s;t of their politene&s;s in thus dignifying a man who has little preten&s;ion to public favour, I had no doubt but that the com|pilers, or compilers directors had compli|mented me with a &s;imilar appellation;&mdash;but I was again mi&s;taken: I found (in Page 142) <HI>my</HI> de&s;ert would procure me barely the title of plain <HI>Tru&s;s-maker.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons whom this RUPTURE-CURER has a&s;&s;i&s;ted, would per&s;uade me out of a notion that it is death which generally performs the cure for this worthy gentleman. I am a&s;&s;ured that tho&s;e Tru&s;&s;es &s;aid to be of his making are too painful even for a hor&s;e to wear. He prides him&s;elf, I am told, on employing the &s;ame per&s;ons who did bu&s;ine&s;s for my Predece&s;&s;or.&mdash;As a proof of the ab&s;urdity of building on another's &s;uppo&s;ed reputation, when I was appointed
<PB N="36" REF="39">Tru&s;s-maker to Greenwich Ho&s;pital, I could not find one in twenty of the ruptured men in that place, who could wear the Tru&s;&s;es made by my predoce&s;&s;or; and tho&s;e who did wear them were &s;o mi&s;erably fretted and galled on their Hips and Loins, that they were obliged to attend the Surgeon every morning to have their Wounds dre&s;&s;ed: So that by my ap|pointment, I had the plea&s;ure not only of re|lieving the di&s;ea&s;ed men from the mi&s;ery they &s;uffered by the iron Tru&s;&s;es before made u&s;e of, but prevented the &s;urgeons from being troubled with the like complaints, and &s;aved the expences of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BEING, about twenty-eight years &s;ince, af|flicted with a Rupture, I con&s;ented to become a Patient to Me&s;&s;rs. Woodward and Hunt; and from a &s;trict attention to their method, I am enabled to give the Reader &s;ome idea of it. The fir&s;t object then with them was, to ex|amine the Patient&mdash;with re&s;pect to his circum|&s;tances. If he would part freely with his mo|ney, they fir&s;t applied a linen Bandage; and &s;hortly after informed him, that was not &s;uffi|cient of it&s;elf to perform the cure, and that they mu&s;t call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of proper Me|dicines,
<PB N="37" REF="40">with which they would furni&s;h him at one Guinea per Month.&mdash;And in this way did they cajole me out of Fourteen Guineas; and my Rupture was greatly wor&s;e at the year's end than when fir&s;t I became their Patient.</P>
<P>I AM here induced to relate a Story which cannot be contradicted, and which will &s;erve &s;ufficiently to expo&s;e the fallacy of trifling and vain pretenders. A gentleman of 70 years of age, who has been afflicted many years with a Rupture, and who has worn a Tru&s;s of my making for upwards of the&s;e five years, which rendered his Rupture, tho' by no means cura|ble, of little trouble to him, was very lately per&s;uaded to apply to Mr. L. a Surgeon, for a complete cure. He accordingly waited on that gentleman, to know if he would take his ca&s;e in hand, and what the expence would be. Mr. L. told him he had no doubt of effecting a cure, even if he was eighty years old; and as he was only a Trade&s;man, he believed he could do it for about 30 Guineas; but that the Patient mu&s;t wait on him every morning. This, the gentleman informed him, was a thing he could not do; and the Surgeon, therefore, con&s;ented to call upon him.&mdash;Next
<PB N="38" REF="41">morning Mr. L. dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of black vel|vet, drove in his chariot to his Patient's. The trad&s;eman, reflecting that this appearance of grandeur was not kept up at a &s;mall expence, determined to make a &s;ure bargain, and ac|cordingly told the Surgeon,&mdash;<Q>"Sir, before we proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, let me know exactly what the expence of this cure will be; and if no cure&mdash;no pay."</Q>&mdash;At this the Surgeon "&s;tarted like a <HI>guilty thing,"</HI> and turning on his heel, whipp'd into his chariot, and drove home,&mdash;no doubt &s;ufficiently mortified at the di&s;appointment.&mdash;I have only to remark, that if every afflicted per&s;on would endeavour to make as certain a bargain as my Patient in|tended to do with the above-mentioned im|pudent a&s;&s;ertor, the velvet &s;uits of &s;uch pet|tifoggers in genius would &s;oon be ru&s;ty, and their Chariots without a wheel.</P>
<P>I AM acquainted with many per&s;ons of both &s;exes who have been Patients to Mr. L. and they all agree that the following is his method of operation: Fir&s;t, he applies a Bandage, as Woodward and Hunt u&s;ed to do. The Pati|ent mu&s;t then attend on him once a day for &s;o many times as he &s;hall appoint, and at the&s;e times he applies a bru&s;h dipt in &s;ome|thing
<PB N="39" REF="42">which he calls an A&s;tringent. When he is tired of bru&s;hing, he pronounces a com|plete cure; which &s;hould the Patient pre&s;ume to doubt, he is capable of behaving in the mo&s;t in&s;olent manner, which he ju&s;tifies by the affront offered to his knowledge:&mdash;and &s;hould their &s;pirit on the occa&s;ion equal his impu|dence (which is barely po&s;&s;ible), he will even go &s;o far as to threaten a pro&s;ecution for defa|mation. To corroborate this fact, it is well known that, about &s;even years ago, this &s;ame Mr. L. obtained a verdict of eighty pounds from a Surgeon of eminence, and another of an hundred pounds from a Gentleman in the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion equally re&s;pectable, for a pre|tended defamation; and has &s;ince been at the point of being pilloried for his mal-practices on his Ruptured Patients.</P>
<P>I MUST here beg leave to introduce a pa&s;&s;age from Mr. Pott's Treati&s;e on Ruptures, p. 169. <Q>"The hi&s;tories of Prior, Cabriere, Bowles, Sir Thomas Renton, Dr. Littlejohn, &amp;c. &amp;c. to be found in Dionis, Hou&s;ton, and other writers, will furni&s;h to the Reader an idea of the practice and performances of &s;ome who have &s;tood at the head of tho&s;e bold promi&s;ers."</Q>&mdash;<Q>"This is a &s;ubject in which
<PB N="40" REF="43"> mankind are much intere&s;ted, and on which a good deal might be &s;aid; but as an ho|ne&s;t endeavour to &s;ave the afflicted from the hands of tho&s;e who have no character to lo&s;e, and who&s;e only point is money, might from one of the profe&s;&s;ion be mi&s;con&s;trued into malevolence and craft, I will not enter into it; but &s;hall conclude by wi&s;hing, that they who have capacity to judge of the&s;e matters (which are as much the object of common|&s;en&s;e as any other kind of knowledge) would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be deluded by the impudent a&s;&s;ertions of any Charlatan whatever; but determine in this, as they do in many other things, that is, by the event."</Q>&mdash;There is a &s;entence in &s;acred writ which naturally &s;trikes me on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion&mdash;<Q>"Out of <HI>thy own</HI> mouth will I <HI>con|demn</HI> thee."</Q>&mdash;Let the Reader join the above quotations, and think for him&s;elf.&mdash;I &s;nall only &s;ay, that I &s;incerely wi&s;h Coun&s;el|lor Brand's <HI>Surgeon of character</HI> would reflect on the very <HI>excellent</HI> opinion of Mr. Pott, be|fore he receives his fee merely for approving what the <HI>Shoemaker</HI> has done, or preparing the way for what he is to do.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="44">
<P>WITH re&s;pect to my&s;elf, without a vain pre|tence to a thorough knowledge of Surgery, it is my boa&s;t that a &s;tudious application, long experience, and, above all, a &s;trict adherence to the principles of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Readers, I hope, will not accu&s;e me of o&s;tenta|tion when I remark, that from the 7th of November, 1770, to the 31&s;t of January, 1771, I have given away Tru&s;&s;es to per&s;ons who were incapable of purcha&s;ing them, to the amount of 23l. 2s.&mdash;Atte&s;tations of the truth of which from the Over&s;eers, &amp;c. of the dif|ferent pari&s;hes to which they belong, are ready to be pro|duced to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;ire to &s;ee them: A greater &s;um, I believe, than is di&s;pen&s;ed to the poor afflicted with Ruptures from all the Ho&s;pitals, except Greenwich and Chel&s;ea, in the &s;ame period of time.</NOTE> Humanity, have fixed me in the mid&s;t of a mo&s;t exten&s;ive practice. That there are per&s;ons who bear me illw-ill, I have no doubt; but I have the con&s;olation, that, in this ca&s;e, tho&s;e who are <HI>my</HI> enemies are the enemies of Society.&mdash;I de&s;pi&s;e the reflections thrown out again&s;t me on account of my former profe&s;&s;ions: Such reflections are at once a proof of ill manners and ill principles. The good and the &s;en&s;ible will acknowledge, that it is as po&s;&s;ible for a &s;oldier to attain a knowledge of the true method of reducing
<PB N="42" REF="45">Ruptures and applying Tru&s;&s;es, as it was for Frere Jacques to di&s;cover the proper manner of cutting for the &s;tone; for a friar to in&s;truct the world in the u&s;e of Gun-powder; or a &s;oldier to invent the important and u&s;eful art of Printing. From a conviction that the Pupils in the different Ho&s;pitals in town &s;eldom had an opportunity of &s;eeing a Rupture, and from a de&s;ire to render a knowledge of its proper treatment more general; I very lately gave them a public invitation to &s;ee me perform the operation of reducing Ruptures, and the retention of them when &s;o reduced by apply|ing Tru&s;&s;es, which is the only remedy, at all ages, and in all &s;tates, of reducible Ruptures. At the &s;ame time, I provided a number of ca&s;es, &s;ome of which were acknowledged by Mr. Hunter to be the mo&s;t &s;ingular he re|membered to have met with.&mdash;However, this good di&s;po&s;ition in me could not e&s;cape cen&s;ure;&mdash;an undi&s;tingui&s;hing haughtine&s;s con|&s;trued it an affront&mdash;and I was informed, that if I per&s;i&s;ted in that practice, it would greatly offend the Faculty. To exculpate my&s;elf from a de&s;ign to give offence, I &s;hall only refer to the feelings of every candid Reader, and &s;ay,
<PB N="43" REF="46">that I meant a &s;ervice to the world. In conclu|&s;ion, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a few Ca&s;es, and for the pre&s;ent take my leave,&mdash;wi&s;hing tho&s;e who condemn from ignorance, more know|ledge;&mdash;tho&s;e who a&s;per&s;e from malevolence, more good-nature.</P>

<P>ON the 20th of January, one of the In|pen&s;ioners of Greenwich Ho&s;pital ap|plied to me, in the Surgery of that place, for a Tru&s;s for a double Rupture. Upon examining him, I &s;ound the Rupture &s;ingle only, and in the right Groin; in the left Groin the Te&s;ticle lying in an oval figure, acro&s;s the orifice, where a Rupture generally de&s;cends, and no appear|ance of the Scrotum on the left &s;ide of the Penis. This mo&s;t extraordinary &s;ituation was occa&s;ioned, he informed me, by a fall acro&s;s the gunnel of a boat about twelve months ago. When the Tru&s;s was properly applied, the Bandage did not in the &s;malle&s;t degree com|pre&s;s the Te&s;ticle oppo&s;ite to the Rupture; and I have the &s;atisfaction to &s;ay, that there is now the greate&s;t probability of a palliative cure being effected. Tho&s;e who doubt the authenticity of this relation are intreated to refer to the cheque book, which is kept in the Surgery of the above-mentioned Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>ON the 7th of November la&s;t, a poor man, recommended by Mr. Benjamin Morris, Over&s;eer of the Poor of St. Luke, Middle&s;ex,
<PB N="45" REF="48">came to me for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He &s;aid, that about ten Months before that time, he felt &s;omething in his Groin which was not then attended with any pain: However, it by degrees in|crea&s;ed, and increa&s;ing grew very painful, and much larger; and that very often it made him &s;o &s;ick, that it would occa&s;ion him to throw up what he had eaten, and was often incapa|ble of working for his bread;&mdash;for that when he was in an upright po&s;ture his Rupture would &s;ometimes fall down with that violence as to bur&s;t open the codpiece of his breeches. I applied a Tru&s;s; and the la&s;t time I &s;aw him, which was the 14th of January la&s;t, he informed me, that ever &s;ince I applied the Tru&s;s to his Rupture, it had not fallen down once, nor had he lo&s;t a day's work. Any per|&s;on who &s;hall doubt this, may be &s;atisfied of the truth of the ca&s;e by applying to Mr. Morris above-mentioned, or at my hou&s;e, where they will be &s;hewn a letter of thanks from the Pa|tient him&s;elf, who&s;e de&s;ire it is the &s;ame may be publicly &s;een.</P>
<P>THOMAS We&s;t, a young man about twenty, applied to me on the 24th of December la&s;t, for relief in the ca&s;e of a Rupture, which he
<PB N="46" REF="49">had had ever &s;ince he was fourteen years of age. It was, at the time mentioned, increa&s;ed to the &s;ize of eight inches circumference from the Te&s;ticle above the Os Pubis. I reduced it all, and applied a Tru&s;s thereon, at the &s;ame time informing him in what manner he &s;hould proceed to obtain a perfect cure. In about ten days he came to me again, &s;aid he had been very punctual in the ob&s;ervation of my directions, and that he was completely cured, notwith&s;tanding he had u&s;ed all manner of common exerci&s;es. He then pulled off his Tru&s;s, coughed and blowed his no&s;e in a vio|lent manner, and &s;aid there was no occa&s;ion for wearing the Tru&s;s any longer. I a&s;ked him if wearing it gave him any pain; he replied no; and I ordered him not to leave it off for a few months.&mdash;This extraordinary ca&s;e will be authenticated by applying to Mr. We&s;t, Lighterman, in King-Street, Deptford, who is the Patient's Brother.</P>
<P>ABOUT two years and a half ago, a lad of twelve years of age was brought to me by Mr. Macguire, Peruke-maker, of Hedge|lane, for the cure of a Rupture. When I ex|amined him, I found the Rupture, which was
<PB N="47" REF="50">in the right Groin, prodigiou&s;ly large, with the Te&s;ticle at the lower extremity of it: The left Te&s;ticle was confined in the abdomen, and had been &s;o ever &s;ince he could remember. By the proper application of my Ela&s;tic Tru&s;s, he obtained a radical cure in about nine months; the right Te&s;ticle at that time re|maining in its proper and natural &s;tate in the Scrotum. I then told him he might lay the Tru&s;s a&s;ide. In a few months after, Mr. Mac|guire brought the boy to me again; &s;aid his Rupture was extremely bad, and that he mu&s;t have another Tru&s;s.&mdash;On examining him, &s;o far from having a Rupture, his right Te&s;ti|cle had followed the Rupture into the abdo|men, and, with the left, remains in that &s;tate to this day; and what is &s;till more remarka|ble, there is not the &s;malle&s;t appearance of the Scrotum, altho' the Penis remains in its na|tural &s;tate.</P>
