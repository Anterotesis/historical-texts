<HEAD>SYNOPSIS OF THE CAUSES OF <HI>CHRONIC DISEASES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL arts, whether <HI>pla&s;tic, mathematical, mechanical,</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical,</HI> are but the hand|maids and imitators of Nature. Mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful is the practitioner who can happily trace her path, and can copy neare&s;t to the divine origi|nal: Who, knowing her ways, is able to lend a hand when &s;he is ob&s;tructed; or can render her propitious by gentle and well timed invita|tions. In the healing art particularly, it was ob&s;erved two thou&s;and years ago by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the great father of medical &s;cience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, that, NA|TURE <HI>is the &s;overeign curer of di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and that <HI>phy&s;icians are, or ought to be, her humble imita|tors</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> <HI>and &s;ervants</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. By uncea&s;ing attendance on the &s;ick, invincible patience, and the mo&s;t vigilant ob&s;ervation of every action and motion of NATURE, that illu&s;trious <HI>Archiater</HI> acquired a wonderful knowledge of the genuine nature of di&s;ea&s;es,&mdash;of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, and of the gra|dual,
<PB N="6" REF="5">uniform, con&s;entient operations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. L. de Aliment.</NOTE> of that exqui&s;ite mechani&s;m, and innate, energetic principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, with which the CREATOR of <HI>man</HI> hath been plea&s;ed to en|dow our bodies: And, by carefully comparing the &s;ame &s;ort of di&s;tempers, and their various minute motions, in different patients, and all the circum&s;tances [<GAP DESC="foreign">] and accidents [<GAP DESC="foreign">] which u&s;ually preceded and at|tended them, he could readily foretel an ap|proaching di&s;ea&s;e, and after its inva&s;ion, give a right judgment of the progre&s;s and event of it.</P>
<P>This &s;urprizing <HI>&s;kill</HI> of his, in foretelling the approach, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes, and event, of di&s;|ca&s;es, and <HI>that</HI> of other &s;ucceeding phy&s;icians who carefully &s;tudied and pur&s;ued his method, procured them a kind of religious veneration among the people, who were wont to look upon them as prophets in&s;pired by the Gods, and even as arbiters of life and death.</P>
<P>But as this <HI>old method</HI> of acquiring the <GAP DESC="foreign"> is extremely tedious, crabbed, and &s;evere, it has been little regarded for many ages, except by certain particular re|tainers to the <HI>Coan</HI> &s;chool; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as <HI>Sydenham</HI> and his truly ingenious and &s;ingu|larly mode&s;t tran&s;lator <HI>Mapletoft</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From an authenticated copy of the original manu&s;cript (which the writer had, &s;ome years ago, and he believes has &s;till, in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) of Doctor Sydenham's dedication of his works to Doctor Mapletoft, it appears, that this mo|de&s;t tran&s;lator hath, in his Latin ver&s;ion, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed many high encomiums paid to him&s;elf. A further in&s;tance of Doctor Mapletoft's &s;ingular delicacy, as related, with o|ther anecdotes of him, to the author by his grand&s;on, a gentleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed probity and learning, now liv|ing, is, that after having exerci&s;ed the profe&s;&s;ion of phy|&s;ic, with reputation and &s;ucce&s;s, to the age of forty-eight, he then left off practice, purely on account of the in&s;upe|rable &s;olicitude of mind his fellow-feeling for the &s;ick under his care con&s;tantly produced.</NOTE>, <HI>Bagtivi, Boerbaave, Mead, Huxham,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>In later times, a much ea&s;ier and more com|pendious way to fame and opulence has been happily di&s;covered: And we can now, with &s;ingular propriety, apply to the ancient practice of <HI>ob&s;ervation,</HI> what that lucky &s;on of fortune <HI>Gnatho</HI> (in <HI>Terence</HI>) told an hone&s;t, &s;imple, half-&s;tarved brother of his, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion &mdash;

He had frequently ob&s;erved, in the practice of his divine mi&s;tre&s;s, that a &s;pontaneous haemorrhage of blood from the no&s;e always mitigated, and oftentimes carried off, certain kinds of fevers, and other violent di&s;orders. This &s;ugge&s;ted to him the practice of <HI>artificial</HI> haemorrhages by <HI>bleeding, &s;carification,</HI> &amp;c. which he likewi&s;e u&s;ed, on certain occa&s;ions, <HI>prophylactically,</HI> or by way of prevention: For <HI>experience</HI> had taught this con&s;ummate arti&s;t, that tho&s;e means which were wont to a&s;&s;uage bad &s;ymptoms after they appeared, would prevent their coming on, if u&s;ed in proper time. He had likewi&s;e ob&s;erv|ed, that NATURE frequently cured certain di&s;|ea&s;es by &s;pontaneous ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in different parts of the body. When he found NATURE pre|vented from working her own way, by &s;uch &s;a|lutary operations, he &s;ub&s;tituted in their room <HI>artificial</HI> ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, &s;uch as <HI>i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It became farther obvious to him, that &s;ome violent di&s;orders were carried off by a &s;ponta|neous diarrhoea, or vomiting; others by plen|tiful warm &s;weats, or a gentle moi&s;ture of the &s;kin; others again by a critical di&s;charge of urine, and &s;ome by expectoration, &amp;c. Hence

That the opinion of the <HI>&s;pecific operations,</HI> or, which is the &s;ame thing, the occult qualities, of medicines, in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, continues to be a prevailing principle in phy&s;ic, the pub|lications of the current century, and &s;hop re|cords, mutually evince: Though 'tis evident, that, agreeably to this doctrine, and method of procedure, it will be impo&s;&s;ible ever to fix any

<PB N="12" REF="11"></P>
<P>With regard to this <HI>&s;pecific practice,</HI> (the con|&s;tant political &s;ubterfuge of <HI>phy&s;ic-craft</HI>) it is well known to every judicious experienced phy|&s;ician, that the artful pretence of curing di&s;|ea&s;es by the occult qualities of &s;pecific remedies, is now, as it always has been, the principal &s;ource of all the knavery, impudence, and ig|norance, that we meet with in the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Any <HI>&s;emicrude</HI> practitioner in this way, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a tolerable &s;hare of cunning and addre&s;s, can never want a &s;pecious pretext for making a property of his patient, almo&s;t as long as he plea&s;es, by flattering his hopes from time to time; tho' the patient finds him&s;elf never the better, but perhaps &s;till grows wor&s;e: If one &s;pecific &s;ucceed not, another is tried, and, if that fails, a third, and &s;o on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>; as long as the poor infatuated believing &s;ufferer has any money, &s;trength, or patience left.</P>
<P>Suffice it here to quote one in&s;tance, out of a multitude that might be produced, of this <HI>medicina politica;</HI> and be that the <HI>&s;pecific</HI> treat|ment of tho&s;e <HI>chronical</HI> di&s;orders commonly di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the technical epithets of <HI>arthri|tic, rheumatic, &s;corbutic, hy&s;teric,</HI> and <HI>hypocon|driac.</HI> Several hundred volumes (without count|ing tho&s;e petit e&s;&s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> that are daily &s;pewing out of the pre&s;s) have been profe&s;&s;edly written<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> on the cau&s;es, &amp;c. of the&s;e maladies: Though
<PB N="13" REF="12">their whole aetiology may be compri&s;ed in a few words.&mdash;Ea&s;e, indolence, intemperance, indulged plea&s;ure, irregular gratifications of the natural appetites, and the want of pure, fre&s;h air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The greate&s;t ma&s;ter in phy&s;ic looks upon <HI>air</HI> as the fountain of life and health to man; and moreover a&s;cribes to <HI>it,</HI> in a great mea&s;ure, the different &s;ize, &s;hape, com|plexion, manners, di&s;po&s;ition, government, and genius, of different nations. For in&s;tance, in the fertile regions of A&s;ia, which approach neare&s;t of any, in his opinion, to the original nature and temperature of the &s;ea&s;ons. [<GAP DESC="foreign">] moderate heat and moi&s;ture render the men plump [<GAP DESC="foreign">], extremely hand&s;ome, and of the large&s;t &s;ize. &mdash;From the extraordinary mildne&s;s of their air and climate, the manners of the <HI>ea&s;tern A&s;iatics</HI> are more ea&s;y, gentle, and unactive [<GAP DESC="foreign">], than tho&s;e of the <HI>northern A&s;iatics</HI> and <HI>Euro|peans.</HI>
<P>From the &s;ame cau&s;e, their di&s;po&s;itions are &s;oft, coward|ly, and effeminate, impatient of labour and hard&s;hip. Whatever, &s;ays he, is manly, laborious, painful, or bold and daring, [<GAP DESC="foreign">] can find no place in &s;uch a con|&s;titution; but <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> is the governing principle: And hence proceeds the great variety of forms among&s;t their wild bea&s;ts&mdash;Neither is the mind, in &s;uch a con&s;titution, &s;ubject to &s;urpri&s;es [<GAP DESC="foreign">], nor the body to violent changes; circum&s;tances that are apt to give a &s;harper edge to the pa&s;&s;ions, and a higher degree of under&s;tanding, and &s;prightly vigour, than where things remain continually in the &s;ame &s;tate: For the mind of man is always rou&s;ed, and not &s;uffered to re&s;t, by fre|quent and &s;udden changes. Upon the&s;e accounts, the <HI>ea&s;tera A&s;tatics</HI> are weak, timorous, and &s;ervile, ea&s;ily &s;lid|ing into monarchies: With reluctance they leave their ea&s;e and families, and hazard their lives for de&s;potic ma&s;ters. On the other hand, in <HI>Greece,</HI> and the <HI>northern</HI> parts of A&s;ia, where the temperature of the &s;ea&s;ons is le&s;s mild, and le&s;s uniform, the men are bold, hardy, and warlike: Without compul&s;ion they quit their ea&s;e, and voluntarily expo&s;e them&s;elves to toil and danger, animated with the hopes, and rewarded with the fruits, of conque&s;t.</P>
<P>In countries abounding with certain mines, travellers find the frame and temper of their minds &s;uddenly altered; their intellectual faculties more &s;prightly and vigorous, con|ceptions clearer, imagination more bri&s;k and lively; and on pa&s;&s;ing to another &s;oil, an univer&s;al relaxation, idea, gloomy, confu&s;ed, and indi&s;tinct, immediately &s;ucceed. Thus, con&s;onant to the philo&s;ophic notions of the DIVINE OLD MAN, the di&s;covery, and improvement, of arts and &s;ciences may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend upon the air and climate; &s;ome &s;ucceeding be&s;t, where a &s;prightline&s;s of fancy, others, where inten&s;e application of mind, is re|quired.</P>
<P>In a <HI>medicinal</HI> intention, the <HI>vivifying &s;pirit</HI> of pure, fre&s;h air is admirable: In acute di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>putrid</HI> and <HI>epidemic</HI> kind, millions of lives have been lo&s;t for want of it.</P>
<P>In a <HI>pharmaceutic</HI> intention, air, or the humid part of it, acts as a true di&s;&s;olvent, in the &s;ame manner as water in its gro&s;&s;er form. The cathartic and a&s;tringent virtues of certain vegetables neither volatile nor exhalable by heat, but of the fixed kind and di&s;&s;oluble by <HI>men&s;trua</HI> alone, have been ob&s;erved to be diffu&s;ed through the air. Hence it appears, that the atmo&s;phere may be impregnated with all the medicinal powers of vegetables which <HI>aqueous men&s;trua</HI> are capable of extracting. And upon this account it is, that, in &s;tanding, walking, or &s;leeping, under &s;everal kind of trees, people have found them&s;elves variou&s;ly af|fected.</P>
<P>The peculiar medicinal powers of certain vegetables <HI>ex|halable by heat,</HI> are, by the bye, equally remarkable and curious. In ob&s;tinate watchings, and deliriums, the au|thor has, by the &s;teams of one of this kind, procured ea&s;e, re&s;t, and &s;leep, after all the u&s;ual internal &s;edative medi|cines had been tried in vain.</P>
<P>In acute di&s;ea&s;es of the malignant kind, where &s;weating was indicated, but could not be procured by any internal means, the effluvia of a vegetable, applied in a certain manner to the external &s;urface of the body, have proved an efficacious &s;udorific.</P>

<P>There is not in the whole compa&s;s of medicine, a more efficacious remedy, in certain ca&s;es, than the <HI>natural chaly|beate waters,</HI> that is, &s;uch as receive their medicinal pro|perties from iron: For, as the learned <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ob&s;erves, where the powers of the body are debilitated by a preterna|tural relaxation of the &s;olids, and an indolent, cold, aque|ous indi&s;po&s;ition of the fluids, no virtue of any vegetable or animal &s;ub&s;tance, no diet, or regimen, can effect that, which is effected by iron and its preparations.

<PB N="42" REF="41">the bodily heat, when at the highe&s;t, from &s;ix to fourteen <HI>degrees</HI> below <HI>that</HI> of perfect health.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ancient phy&s;icians of the <HI>Hippocratic</HI> &s;chool, had no other <HI>idea</HI> of a fever than <HI>that</HI> of their great ma&s;ter&mdash;viz. a <HI>fiery</HI> or <HI>preternatural heat.</HI> This preternatural heat they conceived of, as a <HI>&s;ymptom,</HI> the cure of which was the province of the phy&s;ician; whil&s;t the removing, and carrying off, the <HI>pri|mary cau&s;e</HI> of this &s;ymptom, that is, the cure of the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> was con&s;idered chiefly as the work of NATURE. Now, the <HI>primary cau&s;e</HI> of every fever is, as the author conceives, &s;ome <HI>&s;timulant or acrid matter &s;pa&s;modically affecting the va&s;cular and nervous &s;y&s;tem:</HI> Whether this matter be, 1&s;t.

<P>From this pa&s;&s;age in Galen, Sanctorius undoubtedly took the fir&s;t hint of his <HI>&s;tatical</HI> experiments for a&s;certain|ing the daily wa&s;te of the animal fluids, made by the out|lets of the external &s;uperficies of the body, and by the lungs: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the quantity of this wa&s;te, without knowing, at the &s;ame time, the quantity of moi&s;ture, &amp;c. ab&s;orbed or imbibed by the pores of the &s;kin and lungs; <HI>which Sanctorius did not advert to:</HI> For the author of this, after violent exerci&s;e in riding, notwith|&s;tanding a great expence of per&s;pirable matter, and no food taken, has, in certain con&s;titutions of the air and atmo|&s;phere, facilitating the <HI>cutaneous immi&s;&s;ions,</HI> often found him|&s;elf, by mo&s;t exact &s;tatical experiments, many ounces, &s;ome|times twenty and upwards heavier than he was before. Hence it appears, that all we can with certainty di&s;cover, re&s;pect|ing the quantity of <HI>&s;anctorian</HI> per&s;piration, by experiments of this kind, is, the difference between the <HI>exhalata</HI> and the <HI>inhalata,</HI> that is, between the per&s;pirable matter we exhale from the pores of the &s;kin and lungs, and whatever we imbibe or inhale through the &s;ame: For exhalation and in|halation &s;o confound each other as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the exact quantity of either; as the author pur|po&s;es, in a &s;hort time, to demon&s;trate more at large to the medical reader.</P></NOTE>, retained in

<P>OF all the branches of medical knowledge, the mo&s;t highly intere&s;ting, and &s;ub&s;er|vient to health, long life, and happine&s;s in this world, is the <HI>prophylactic,</HI> founded upon the two great preventive principles, DIET and HA|BITUAL EXERCISE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By habitual exerci&s;e the author means not &s;uch as is frequently undertaken, but &s;eldom gone through with; but &s;uch as is brought to a habit, by being clo&s;ely repeated, with moderation, and without any irregular intermi&s;&s;ion. 'Tis the want of a right conception of a <HI>habit</HI> that has oc|ca&s;ioned the abu&s;e and neglect of this &s;overeign <HI>preventive</HI> of di&s;ea&s;es, as well as <HI>common aid</HI> to phy&s;ic.&mdash;By continual dropping, even &s;o &s;oft a body as water can act upon a &s;tone; by ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;uing his blow, the &s;mith can bring heat into his bar of iron: The act it&s;elf, &s;imply con&s;idered, is weak and trifling; but the habit is of wonderful efficacy. &mdash;'By temperance, and a &s;ingular per&s;everance in the virtuous toil of martial exerci&s;es,' <HI>Socrates</HI> (the light and glory of the heathen world) is &s;aid to have acquired a con|&s;titution &s;uperior to the inclemency of the elements, and to the attacks of di&s;ea&s;e; &s;triking in&s;tances of which we find recorded by <HI>Plato (Conviv.</HI> and <HI>Phaed.</HI> where it ap|pears, that he had brought him&s;elf, by the force of habit, to u&s;e the &s;ame cloathing, and to go barefooted, all the year round), by <HI>Diogenes Laertius</HI> in his life of that prince of philo&s;ophers, and by <HI>Aelian</HI> in his <HI>various hi&s;tory:</HI> The following is one of them&mdash;"When an almo&s;t univer&s;al pe&s;tilence had &s;eized upon the camp, at the &s;iege of <HI>Poti|daea,</HI> in&s;omuch that eleven hundred men in the army were carried off, and <HI>Athens</HI> was half depopulated, by the con|tagion, he e&s;caped the di&s;temper in both places, and was the only one, before <HI>Potidaea,</HI> who, during the two years blockade of that city, did not in &s;ome mea&s;ure feel the &s;everity of it [<GAP DESC="foreign">.]</NOTE>&mdash;THE ONLY SURE MEANS

<P>On this pre&s;ervative branch of medicine, and particularly on the <HI>dietetic</HI> part of it, a multi|tude of books have been written; many of them by phy&s;icians of eminence, with a &s;pirit of phi|lanthropy that does honour to the profe&s;&s;ion. But, as tho&s;e productions con&s;i&s;t chiefly of ge|neral rules laid down for mankind without di|&s;tinction, to pre&s;erve their health, and prolong their lives, they have not proved in any degree adequate to the propo&s;ed end: For, &s;o infinite is the variety of con&s;titutions, (in re&s;pect of which all food acts, by a certain immutable law of Nature, <HI>relatively &amp; &s;ecundum quid,</HI> as logi|cians expre&s;s it, not <HI>ab&s;olutely &amp; per &s;e</HI>) that any general rule laid down to any number of men, for this purpo&s;e, mu&s;t be hurtful or de|&s;tructive to the greate&s;t part of them at lea&s;t,
<PB N="47" REF="46">if they all comply with it. Happily for man|kind, all the needful directions, on this head, <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> conducive to health and long life, may be comprized in a very &s;mall compa&s;s, without overloading the memory, or confound|ing the judgment.&mdash;If people would only follow the dictates of that mo&s;t beneficent of all legi&s;lators, Nature, by letting the &s;tomach <HI>al|ways</HI> take the lead of the palate, and by feed|ing moderately upon &s;uch things as they find they can dige&s;t with the lea&s;t trouble and in|convenience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.&mdash;Vid.

<P>As for tho&s;e whim&s;ical hypocondriacs who, like their brain-&s;ick brother in the comedy of <HI>Moliere,</HI> are eternally making an outcry, tho' nothing ails them, and tho&s;e more e&s;pecially who have been per&s;uaded to purcha&s;e health and longevity by eating and drinking exactly by weight and mea&s;ure, as if they could &s;upply the various and alterable exigences of Nature ju&s;t as they fill a tub, the capacity and di&s;|charges
<PB N="48" REF="47">of which are always uniform and the &s;ame; they are in imminent danger of falling into the doctors hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would &s;eem, that this &s;ort of <GAP DESC="foreign"> mu&s;t have been very badly off for a phy&s;ician, in the time of ho|ne&s;t E&s;culapius, [<GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;&s;o the prince of poets titles him] of venerable memory, if what Plato tells us of him, in his <HI>Republic,</HI> be true; namely, that it was his de|liberate opinion&mdash;"That in all well regulated &s;ocieties, where every man has his &s;tation affigned him, no man can, or ought to have lei&s;ure to be a <HI>valetudinarian</HI> all his life, and be&s;tow his whole care upon his carca&s;e." He farther informs us, that his two &s;ons, Podalirius and Machaon, were of the &s;ame opinion, and maintained, "that phy&s;ic was not made for <HI>&s;uch people,</HI> and that it was not their duty to pre&s;cribe for them, even though they were as rich as Midas!!"</NOTE>. An oeconomi&s;t of this &s;ort might, with equal propriety, impo&s;e upon him&s;elf the critical ta&s;k of &s;tanding or &s;it|ting continually in the &s;ame place, of lying al|ways in the &s;ame bed, of wearing con&s;tantly the &s;ame weight of cloaths, and of riding or walk|ing every day preci&s;ely the &s;ame number of feet and inches; nay farther, he mu&s;t compound with Providence for continual wet weather, or continual dry, for the &s;ame immutable degree of heat and cold, and the &s;ame invariable con|&s;titution of the air in which he breathes: For 'tis certain that all the&s;e may, &s;ome way or other, affect the con&s;titution, appetite, and di|ge&s;tion, &s;o as to require &s;ometimes larger, and
<PB N="49" REF="48">&s;ometimes more &s;paring meals, and the occa|&s;ional u&s;e of weaker or &s;tronger liquors.</P>
<P>In general, the be&s;t rule, perhaps, that can be laid down, for pre&s;erving health, and pro|longing life, is (what the mo&s;t elegant <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> recommended to the world &s;ixteen hundred years ago) <HI>to ob&s;erve &s;trictly no particular rule at all;</HI> but, upon the rational principle of mode|ration and temperance <HI>[noverca medicorum],</HI> to follow the &s;ober dictates of Nature; who has not ordained a &s;ingle want to man, the <HI>rea&s;ona|ble</HI> &s;atisfaction of which, (be&s;ides its manife&s;t &s;ub&s;erviency to health) does not afford a plea|&s;ure every way &s;uperior to what can be found in any unnatural gratification of the appetities: For true plea&s;ure is the bounty of Nature, and Rea&s;on her di&s;pen&s;er of it.</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;In &s;pite of all the fal&s;e refine|ments of art, the true &s;ublime of ta&s;te, and the &s;weet &s;implicity of Nature, will for ever continue in&s;eparable.
