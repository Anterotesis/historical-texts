<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN a book publi&s;hed in the year 1756, I related the principal tran&s;actions of my life, from my entrance into the univer&s;ity to the day of my marriage, in the year 1725; and endeavoured, by the way, to entertain my Readers with a variety of notions and remarks.</P>
<P>I now proceed to tell the remain|der of my &s;tory, and to lay before the Public &s;ome more of my ob&s;er|vations and hints: This &s;econd vo|lume is chiefly a further vindication of my&s;elf; and the ob&s;ervations I add on &s;ubjects and matters of va|rious kinds, are &s;uch reflections as re&s;ulted from the rea&s;on and nature of things, and were formed by a judgment free, and unbia&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="iv" REF="3">any authority. My own apology is the principal thing, inter&s;per&s;ed with real characters of &s;everal &s;orts; and the additions to it, are as ma|ny &s;olid, natural, and delicate ad|ventitious things as came in my way. This is my book. I write with mode&s;ty, and I purpo&s;e to do good. I imagine then, that all <HI>Critics</HI> (except the <HI>Critical Review|ers</HI>) will wink at the blemi&s;hes of a laudable writing. Scholars and men of &s;en&s;e (who are above male|volence and the &s;upercilious tem|per,) can bear deformities in a long work, and ju&s;tly lay them on the imperfection of human nature. They know it is incapable of faultle&s;s productions.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Orlando and Bellinda.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 2. This &s;tory has been told before by the <HI>Tatler,</HI> in his 172d paper; but as he has
<PB N="3" REF="20">related only by hear &s;ay, and was mi&s;taken in &s;everal particulars, the account I give of this extraordinary affair, may be grateful to the reader.</P>
<P>When I was a little boy in <HI>Dublin,</HI> be|tween &s;even and eight, Mr. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and his Lady lived next door to my father, in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and the two families were inti|mate. Being a lively prating thing, Mrs. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> was fond of me, and by tarts and fruit, encouraged me to run into her parlour as often as I could. This made me well acquainted in the hou&s;e; and, as I was a remarker &s;o early in my life, I had an op|portunity of making the following ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P><HI>Orlando Eu&s;tace</HI> was a tall, thin, &s;trong man, well made, and a very genteel per&s;on. His face was pale, and marked with the &s;mall-pox: his features were good, and yet there was &s;omething fierce in his look, even when he was not di&s;plea&s;ed. He had &s;en&s;e and learning, and, with a large fortune, was a generous man; but pa&s;&s;ionate to an amaz|ing degree, for his under&s;tanding; and a trifle would throw him into a rage. He had been humoured in every thing from his cradle, on account of his fine e&s;tate; from his infancy to his manhood, had been continually flattered, and in every thing obeyed. This made him opinionated and proud, ob&s;tinate,
<PB N="4" REF="21">and incapable of bearing the lea&s;t contradic|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Bellinda Coot,</HI> his Lady, with whom he had been pa&s;&s;ionately in love, was as fine a figure as could be &s;een among the daughters of men. Her per&s;on was charming; her face was beautiful, and had a &s;weetne&s;s in it that was plea&s;ing to look at. Her vivacity was great, and her under&s;tanding extraordi|nary; but &s;he had a &s;atirical wit, and a va|nity, which made her delight in &s;hewing the weakne&s;s of other minds, and the clearne&s;s of her own conception. She was too good, however, to have the lea&s;t malice in &s;uch procedure. It was human weakne&s;s, and a de&s;ire to make her neighbours wi&s;er. Un|fortunately for her, &s;he was married to a man, who, of all men in the world, was the unfitte&s;t &s;ubject for her quick fancy to act on.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this, <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and <HI>Bellinda</HI> were, for the mo&s;t of their time, very fond. As &s;he was formed in a prodi|gality of nature, to &s;hew mankind a fini&s;hed compo&s;ition, and had wit and charms enough to fire the dulle&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible heart; a man of <HI>Orlando</HI>'s ta&s;te for the &s;ex, could not be without an inflamed heart, when &s;o near the tran&s;porting object of de&s;ire. She was his delight for almo&s;t a year, the dear &s;upport of his life. He &s;eemed to value her
<PB N="5" REF="22">e&s;teem, her re&s;pect, her love; and endea|voured to merit them by the virtues which fortify love: and therefore, when by his be|ing &s;hort, po&s;itive, and unrea&s;onable in his dictates, as was too often his wont; and on her being intemperate in the &s;trong &s;enti|ments her imagination produced upon the oc|ca&s;ion, which was too frequently the ca&s;e; when they &s;eemed to forget the Apo&s;tle's ad|vice for a while, <HI>that ye love one another with a pure heart, fervently;</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 22. and had &s;trifes and debates, which &s;hewed, for the time they la&s;ted, that they were far from being perfect and entire, wanting nothing; then would her throwing her face into &s;miles, with &s;ome tender expre&s;&s;ion, prove a recon|ciling method at once. Till the fatal night, this always had a power to &s;often pain, to ea&s;e and calm the raging man.</P>
<P>But poor at be&s;t is the condition of hu|man life here below; and, when to weak and imperfect faculties, we add incon&s;i&s;ten|cies, and do not act up to the eternal law of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and of God; when love of fame, curio&s;ity, re&s;entment, or any of our particu|lar propen&s;ities; when humour, vanity, or any of our inferior powers, are permitted to act again&s;t ju&s;tice and veracity, and in|&s;tead of reflecting on the <HI>rea&s;on of the thing,</HI> or the <HI>right of the ca&s;e,</HI> that by the influence this has on the mind, we may be con&s;tituted
<PB N="6" REF="23">virtuous, and attached to truth; we go down with the current of the pa&s;&s;ions, and let bent and humour determine us, in oppo|&s;ition to what is decent and fit: if in a &s;tate &s;o unfriendly as this is, to the heavenly and divine life, where folly and vice are for ever &s;triving to introduce di&s;order into our frame, and it is difficult indeed, to pre&s;erve, in any degree, an integrity of character, and peace within: &mdash; if, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, in&s;tead of labouring to de&s;troy all the &s;eeds of envy, pride, ill-will, and impatience, and endea|vouring to e&s;tabli&s;h and maintain a due inward oeconomy and harmony, by paying a perpetual regard to truth, that is, to the real circum|&s;tances and relation of things in which we &s;tand, &mdash; to the practice of rea&s;on in its ju&s;t extent, according to the capacities and natures of every being; we do, on the contrary, di&s;|regard the <HI>moral faculty,</HI> and become a mere &s;y&s;tem of pa&s;&s;ions and affections, without any thing at the head of them to govern them; &mdash; what then can be expected, but deficiency and deformity, degeneracy and guilty prac|tice? This was the ca&s;e of <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> and <HI>Bel|linda. Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>own-will</HI> were &s;o near and intimate to him, that he &s;eemed to live un|der a deliberate re&s;olution not to be governed by rea&s;on. He would wink at the light he had, &s;truggle to evade conviction, and make his mind a <HI>chaos</HI> and a <HI>hell. Bellinda,</HI> at the
<PB N="7" REF="24">&s;ame time, was too <HI>quick,</HI> too <HI>vain,</HI> and too often forgot to take into her idea of a good character, a <HI>continual &s;ubordination</HI> of the <HI>lower powers</HI> of our nature to the <HI>faculty of rea&s;on.</HI> This produced the following &s;cene.</P>
<P><HI>Maria</HI> (&s;i&s;ter to <HI>Bellinda</HI>) returned one evening with a five-guinea fan &s;he had bought that afternoon, and was tedious in prai&s;ing &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> figures that were painted in it. Mrs. <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> who had a ta&s;te for pictures, &s;aid, the colours were fine, but the images ridiculous and de&s;picable; and her &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t certainly be a little <HI>Indian-mad,</HI> or her fond|ne&s;s for every thing from that &s;ide of the globe could not be &s;o exce&s;&s;ive and extrava|gant as it always appeared to be.</P>
<P>To this <HI>Maria</HI> replied with &s;ome heat, and <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> very peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that &s;he was right. With po&s;itivene&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, he magnified the beauties of the fi|gures in the fan, and with violence reflected &s;o &s;everely on the good judgment <HI>Bellinda,</HI> upon all occa&s;ions, pretended to, (as he ex|pre&s;&s;ed it) that at la&s;t, her imagination was fired, and, with too much eagerne&s;s, &s;he not only ridiculed the opinion of her &s;i&s;ter, in re&s;pect of &s;uch things, but &s;poke with too much warmth again&s;t the de&s;potic tempers of &s;elf-&s;ufficient hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>To reverence and obey (&s;he &s;aid) was not required by any obligation, when men were
<PB N="8" REF="25">unrea&s;onable, and paid no regard to a wife's dome&s;tic and per&s;onal felicity; nor would &s;he give up her under&s;tanding to his weak deter|mination, &s;ince cu&s;tom cannot confer an au|thority which nature has denied: It cannot licen&s;e a hu&s;band to be unju&s;t, nor give right to treat her as a &s;lave. If this was to be the ca&s;e in matrimony, and women were to &s;uf|fer under conjugal vexations, as &s;he did, by his &s;en&s;ele&s;s arguments every day, they had better bear the reproach and &s;olitude of anti|quated virginity, and be treated as the re|fu&s;e of the world, in the character of old maids.</P>
<P>This too lively, though ju&s;t &s;peech, en|raged <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> to the la&s;t degree, and from a fury, he &s;unk in a few minutes into a total &s;ullen &s;ilence, and &s;at for half an hour, while I &s;tayed, cruelly determining, I &s;uppo&s;e, her &s;ad doom. <HI>Bellinda</HI> &s;oon &s;aw &s;he had gone too far, and did all that could be done to recover him from the fit he was in. She &s;miled, cried, a&s;ked pardon; but 'twas all in vain. Every charm had lo&s;t its power, and he &s;eemed no longer man. When this beauty &s;tood weep|ing by his chair, and &s;aid, My love, forgive me, as it was in rallery only I &s;poke, and let our plea&s;ures and pains be hereafter ho|ne&s;tly &s;hared; I remember the tears bur&s;t from my eyes, and in that condition I went away. It was frightful to look at <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="26">as he &s;hook, &s;tarted, and wildly &s;tared; and the di&s;tre&s;s his Lady appeared in, was enough to make the mo&s;t &s;tony heart bleed: it was a di&s;mal &s;cene.</P>
<P>This happened at nine at night, and at ten <HI>Orlando</HI> withdrew to bed, without &s;peak|ing one word, as I was informed. Soon af|ter he lay down, he pretended to be fa&s;t a&s;leep, and his wife rejoicing to find him &s;o, as &s;he believed, in hopes that nature's &s;oft nur&s;e would lull the active in&s;truments of motion, and calm the raging operations of his mind: &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to &s;lumbers, and thought to aboli&s;h for that night every di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of pain: but no &s;oon|er did this furious man find that his charm|ing wife was really a&s;leep, than he plunged a dagger into her brea&s;t. The mon&s;ter re|peated the &s;trokes, while &s;he had life to &s;peak to him, in the tendere&s;t manner, and conjured him, in regard to his own happi|ne&s;s, to let her live, and not &s;ink him&s;elf in|to perdition here and hereafter, by her death. In vain &s;he prayed; he gave her a thou&s;and wounds, and I &s;aw her the next morning a bloody, mangled corp&s;e, in the great hou&s;e in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> which &s;tood at a di&s;tance from the &s;treet, with a wall before it, and an avenue of high trees up to the door; and not in the country, as the <HI>Tatler</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="27">
<HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> fled, when he thought &s;he was expiring, (though &s;he lived for an hour after, to relate the ca&s;e to her maid, who heard her groan, and came into her room) and went from <HI>Dublin</HI> to a little lodge he had in the country, about twenty miles from town. The magi&s;trates, in a &s;hort time, had infor|mation where he was; and one <HI>John Man&s;el,</HI> a con&s;table, a bold and &s;trong man, under|took, for a reward, to apprehend him. To this purpo&s;e, he &s;et out immediately, with a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and a hanger, and lurked &s;everal days and nights in the fields, before he could find an opportunity of coming at him; for <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> lived by him&s;elf in the hou&s;e, well &s;ecured by &s;trong doors and bars, and only went out now and then, to an ale-hou&s;e, the ma&s;ter of which was his friend. Near it, at la&s;t, about break of day, <HI>Man|&s;el</HI> chanced to find him, and, upon his re|fu&s;ing to be made a pri&s;oner, and cocking a pi&s;tol to &s;hoot the officer of ju&s;tice, both their pi&s;tols were di&s;charged at once, and they both dropt down dead men. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> was &s;hot in the heart, and the con&s;table in the brain. They were both brought to <HI>Dublin</HI> on one of the little low-back'd cars there u&s;ed; and I was one of the boys that followed the car, from the beginning of <HI>James-&s;treet,</HI> the out-&s;ide of the city, all thro' the town. <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI>'s head hung dangling
<PB N="11" REF="28">near the ground, with his face upwards, and his torn bloody brea&s;t bare; and of all the faces of the dead I have &s;een, none ever look|ed like his. There was an anxiety, a rage, a horror, and a de&s;pair to be &s;een in it, that no pencil could expre&s;s.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The apolo|gy for the married &s;tate conti|nued.</NOTE>&sect;. 3. Thus fell <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> in the 29th year of his age, and by his hand his virtuous, beautiful, and ingenious wife: and what are we to learn from thence? is it, that on &s;uch accounts, we ought to dread wedlock, and never be concerned with a wife; No, &s;urely; but to be from thence convinced, that it is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a happy marriage, to bring the will to the obedience of rea&s;on, and acquire an equanimity in the general tenour of life. Of all things in this world, <HI>moral dominion,</HI> or the <HI>empire over our&s;elves,</HI> is not only the mo&s;t glorious, as rea&s;on is the &s;u|perior nature of man, but the mo&s;t valu|able, in re&s;pect of real human happine&s;s. A conformity to rea&s;on, or good &s;en&s;e, and to the inclination of our neighbours, with very little money, may produce great and la&s;ting felicity; but without this &s;ub&s;ervience to our own rea&s;on, complai&s;ance to company, and &s;oftne&s;s and benevolence to all around us, the greate&s;t mi&s;ery does frequently &s;prout from the large&s;t &s;tock of fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="29">
It was by ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions, that <HI>Eu|&s;tace</HI> murdered his wife and died him&s;elf, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable and wretched of all hu|man beings. He might have been the hap|pie&s;t of mortals, if he had conformed to the dictates of rea&s;on, and &s;oftened his pa&s;|&s;ions, as well for his own ea&s;e, as in compli|ance to a creature formed with a mind of a quite different make from his own. There is a &s;ort of &s;ex in &s;ouls; and, exclu&s;ive of that love and patience which our religion re|quires, every couple &s;hould remember, that there are things which grow out of their very natures, that are pardonable, when con|&s;idered as &s;uch. Let them not, therefore, be &s;pying out faults, nor find a &s;atisfaction in reproaching; but let them examine to what con&s;equences their ideas tend, and re&s;olve to cea&s;e from cheri&s;hing them, when they lead to contention and mi&s;chief. Let them both endeavour to amend what is wrong in each other, and act as becomes their character, in practi&s;ing the &s;ocial duties of married per|&s;ons, which are &s;o frequently and &s;trongly inculcated by revelation and natural rea&s;on; and then, in&s;tead of matrimony's being a burthen, and hanging a weight upon our very beings, there will be no appearance of evil in it, but harmony and joy will &s;hed un|mixed felicities on them: they will live in no low degree of beatitude in the &s;uburbs of heaven.</P>

This was my ca&s;e: wedlock to me be|came the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; a &s;cene of the mo&s;t refined friend&s;hip, and a condition to which nothing can be added to complete the &s;um of human felicity.

Sen&s;ible to all the ties of &s;ocial truth and ho|nour, my partner and I lived in perfect feli|city, on the products of our &s;olitary farm. The amiable di&s;po&s;itions of her mind, chear|fulne&s;s, good nature, di&s;cretion, and dili|gence, gave a perpetual dignity and lu&s;tre to the grace and loveline&s;s of her per&s;on; and as I did all that love and fidelity could do, by practi&s;ing every rule of caution, prudence, and ju&s;tice, to prevent variance, &s;often cares, and pre&s;erve affection undimini&s;hed, the har|mony of our &s;tate was unmixed and divine. Since the primitive in&s;titution of the relation, it never exi&s;ted in a more delightful manner. Devoted to each other's heart, we de&s;ired no other happine&s;s in this world, than to pa&s;s life away together in the &s;olitude we were in. We lived, hoped, and feared but for each other; and made it our daily &s;tudy to be what revealed religion pre&s;cribes, and the concurrent voice of nature requires, in the &s;acred tie. Do &s;o likewi&s;e, ye mortals, who intend to marry, and ye may, like us, be
<PB N="14" REF="31">happy. As the in&s;tincts and pa&s;&s;ions were wi&s;ely and kindly given us, to &s;ub&s;erve many purpo&s;es of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, let them have their proper, &s;ubaltern &s;hare of action; but let rea&s;on ever have the &s;overeignty, (the di|vine law of rea&s;on and truth) and be, as it were, &s;ail and wind to the ve&s;&s;el of life.</P>

Two years, almo&s;t, this fine &s;cene la&s;ted, and during that period, the bu&s;ine&s;s and diver&s;ions of our lone retreat appeared &s;o various and plea&s;ing, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to think a hundred years &s;o &s;pent, in the lea&s;t degree dull and tedious.

It is <HI>death</HI> that makes the <HI>conquenor</HI> a&s;hamed of his fame, and wi&s;h he had rather &s;tolen out of the world, than purcha&s;ed the report of his ac|tions,
<PB N="20" REF="37">by rapine, oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruelty; by giving in &s;poil the innocent and labouring &s;oul to the idle and in&s;olent; by emptying the cities of the world of their ancient inha|bitants, and filling them again with &s;o many; and &s;o variable &s;orts of &s;orrows. It is <HI>death</HI> tells the <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>in&s;olent,</HI> that they are but <HI>objects,</HI> and humbles them at the in&s;tant; makes them cry, complain, and repent; yea, even to hate their former happine&s;s. It is <HI>death</HI> takes the account of the <HI>rich,</HI> and proves him a <HI>beggar,</HI> a naked beggar, which hath intere&s;t in nothing but the gravel which fills his mouth. It is <HI>death</HI> holds a gla&s;s be|fore the eyes of the mo&s;t <HI>beautiful,</HI> and makes them &s;ee therein their <HI>deformity</HI> and <HI>rotten|ne&s;s;</HI> and they acknowledge it.</P>
<P>Whom none could advi&s;e, thou ha&s;t per|&s;uaded: what none have dared, thou ha&s;t done: and whom all the world hath flatter|ed, thou only ha&s;t ca&s;t out of the world, and de&s;pi&s;ed. Thou ha&s;t drawn together all the far-&s;tretched greatne&s;s, all the pride, cruelty, and ambition, of man; all the powerful charms of beauty; and covered it all over with the&s;e two narrow words, <HI>Hic jacet.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all, <HI>mighty death!</HI> It is thou that leade&s;t to the re&s;urrection of the dead; the di&s;&s;olution of the world; the judgment day; and the eternal &s;tate of men. It is
<PB N="21" REF="38">thou that fini&s;hes the trial of men, and &s;eals their characters, for happine&s;s or mi&s;ery for ever.</P>
<P>Be thou then, <HI>death,</HI> our morning and evening meditation: let us learn from thee the vanity of all human things; and that it is the mo&s;t amazing folly, to melt away time, and mi&s;-apply talents, as the generality of rea&s;onable beings do: that we were not made men, thinking, rational beings, capa|ble of the noble&s;t contemplations, to &s;pend all our thoughts and time in &s;en&s;e and plea|&s;ure, in dre&s;&s;ing, feeding, and &s;porting; or, in purcha&s;es, building and planting; but to prepare for a <HI>dying hour;</HI> that, when at the call of God, we go out of the body, <HI>not knowing whither we go,</HI> we may, like <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> travel by <HI>faith,</HI> and tru&s;t to the con|duct of the Lord of all countries.

<PB N="22" REF="39">to the other, and transfer our principal regard to the immortal &s;pirit; that in the <HI>hour of agony,</HI> a <HI>virtuous mind, purity of con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>good actions,</HI> may procure us the favour of God, and the guidance of his good &s;pirit to the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed, where new plea&s;ures are for ever &s;pringing up, and the happine&s;s of the heavenly inhabitants is per|petually increa&s;ing. This is the one thing needful. <HI>Death</HI> demon&s;trates, that this world of darkne&s;s and error, changes and chances, is not worth fixing our heart on. To &s;ecure our pa&s;&s;age into the regions of per|fect and eternal day, &s;hould be the employ|ment of immortal mortals.</P>
<P>&sect;. 7. Thus did I reflect as I &s;at among the <HI>dead,</HI> with my eyes fa&s;tened on the breath|le&s;s corps of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and I wi&s;hed, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to have leave to depart, and in the ho&s;pitable grave, lie down from toil and pain, to take my la&s;t repo&s;e; for I knew not what to do, nor where to go. I was not qualified for the world; nor had I a friend, or even an acquaintance in it, that I knew where to find. But in vain I prayed; it was otherwi&s;e decreed: I mu&s;t go on, or continue a &s;olitary in the wild I was in. The latter it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to do, in the &s;tate of mind I was in; overwhelmed with &s;orrow, and without a companion of
<PB N="23" REF="40">any kind; and therefore, I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity go to &s;ome other place. I &s;old all the liv|ing things I had to Fryar <HI>Fleming,</HI> and lock|ed up my doors. My furniture, linen, clothes, books, liquors, and &s;ome &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions, in&s;truments of various kinds, and &s;uch like things, I left in their &s;everal places. There was no one to take them, or proba|bility that any one would come there to di&s;|turb them; and perhaps, &s;ome time or other, the fates might bring me back again to the lone place. Though it was then a de&s;olate, &s;ilent habitation, a &s;triking memento of the vanity and precarious exi&s;tence of all human good things; yet it was po&s;&s;ible, that hearty friend&s;hip, fe&s;tivity, and &s;ocial life, might once more be &s;een there. The force and operation of ca&s;ualties did wonders every day, and time might give me even a reli&s;h for the &s;olitude in a few years more. Thus did I &s;ettle affairs in that remote place; and, taking leave of my friend, the fryar, with my lad <HI>O Finn,</HI> rode off.</P>

In an hour, we came to a large and dangerous watery moor, which we cro&s;&s;ed over with great difficulty, and then arrived at a range of mountains, through which there was a nar|row pa&s;s, wet and &s;tony, a long and tedi|ous ride, which ended on the border of a fine country: at four in the afternoon, we arrived on the confines of a plain, about a hundred acres, which was &s;trewed with va|rious flowers of the earth's natural produce, that rendered the glebe delightful to behold, and was &s;urrounded with groves. The place had all the charms that verdure, fo|re&s;t, and vale, can give a country. In the centre of this ground was a hand&s;ome &s;quare building, and behind it a large and beauti|ful garden, which had a low, thick, holly-hedge, that encompa&s;&s;ed it. As the door of this hou&s;e was not locked, but opened by a &s;ilver &s;pring turner, I went in, and found it was one fine &s;pacious room, filled on every &s;ide with books, bound in an extraordinary manner. Globes, tele&s;copes, and other in|&s;truments of various kinds, were placed on &s;tands, and there were two fine writing|tables, one at each end of the library, which had paper, ink, and pens. In the middle of the room there was a reading|de&s;k,

Since a future judgment is mo&s;t certainly the ca&s;e, and the con&s;equence eternal dam|nation or &s;alvation, how contemptible a thing is a long bu&s;y life, &s;pent in raking through the mire of trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, in pur&s;uit of riches and a large e&s;tate; or in &s;weating up the &s;teep hill of ambition, after fame and ambition; or in living and dre&s;|&s;ing as if we were <HI>all body,</HI> and &s;ent into
<PB N="29" REF="46">time for no other purpo&s;e, than to adorn like idols, gratify like brutes, and wa&s;te life in &s;en&s;uality and vanity:&mdash;how contemp|tible and unrea&s;onable is this kind of exi&s;t|ence for beings, who were created to no other end, than to be partakers of a divine life with God, and &s;ing hallelujahs to all e|ternity; to &s;eparate the creature from error, fiction, impurity, and corruption, and ac|quire that purity and holine&s;s, which alone can &s;ee God. Away then with a <HI>worldly heart:</HI> away with all tho&s;e follies, which en|gage us like fools and madmen; and let the principal thing be, to follow the &s;teps of our great ma&s;ter, by patience and re&s;ignation, by a charity and contempt of the world; and by keeping a con&s;cience void of offence, a|mid&s;t the changes and chances of this mor|tal life; that at <HI>his &s;econd coming,</HI> to judge the world, we may be found <HI>acceptable</HI> in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>What a &s;cene mu&s;t this &s;econd coming be! I &s;aw, (&s;ays an apo&s;tle) a great white throne, and him that &s;at on it; from who&s;e face the earth and the heavens fled away, and there was no place found for them; and I &s;aw the dead &s;mall and great &s;tand before God; and the books were opened, and the dead were judged out of tho&s;e things which were written in the books: and the &s;ea gave up her dead, and death and hell delivered
<PB N="30" REF="47">up their dead which were in them, and they were judged every man, according to their works. The <HI>&s;ecret wickedne&s;s</HI> of men will be brought to light; and <HI>concealed piety</HI> and <HI>per|&s;ecuted virtue</HI> be acknowledged and honour|ed. While innocence and piety are &s;et at the right hand of the judge, and the righte|ous &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the king|dom of their father for ever and ever, &s;hame and confu&s;ion mu&s;t &s;it upon the faces of the &s;inner and the ungodly. <HI>Damnation</HI> will &s;tand before the brethren in iniquity, and when the intolerable &s;entence is executed, what inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies will they fall into? what amazement and exce&s;&s;es of horror mu&s;t &s;eize upon them?</P>
<P>Ponder then, in time, fellow-mortal, and chu&s;e to be good, rather than to be great: prefer your bapti&s;mal vows to the pomps and vanities of this world; and value the &s;e|cret whi&s;pers of a good con&s;cience more than the noi&s;e of popular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Since you mu&s;t appear before the judg|ment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t; that every one may re|ceive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad, let it be your work from morning till night, to keep Je&s;us in your hearts; and long for nothing, de&s;ire nothing, hope for no|thing, but to have all that is within you changed into the &s;pirit and temper of the <HI>holy
<PB N="31" REF="48">Je&s;us.</HI> Wherever you go, whatever you do, do all in imitation of his temper and in|clination; and look upon all as nothing, but that which exerci&s;es and increa&s;es the &s;pirit and life of Chri&s;t in your &s;ouls.&mdash;Let this be your Chri&s;tianity, your church, and your religion, and the judgment-day will be a charming &s;cene. If in this world, the will of the creature, as an offspring of the divine will, <HI>wills</HI> and <HI>works</HI> with the <HI>will</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and labours, without cea&s;ing, to come as near as mortals can, to the purity and per|fection of the divine nature; then will the <HI>day of the Lord</HI> be a day of great joy, and with unutterable plea&s;ure, you &s;hall hear that tremendous voice: <HI>Awake, ye dead, and come to judgment.</HI> In tran&s;ports, and full of honour and glory, the wi&s;e and righteous, will hear the happy &s;entence, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</HI>"</P>
<P>This, and the &s;keleton, a&s;toni&s;hed me not a little; and my wonder at the whole in|crea&s;ed, as I could find no human creature living, nor di&s;cover any hou&s;e or cottage for an inhabitant. This I though exceeded all the &s;trange things I had &s;een in this wonder|ful country. But perhaps, (it occured at la&s;t,) there might be a man&s;ion in the woods before me, or &s;omewhere in the groves on either &s;ide; and therefore, leaving the library,
<PB N="32" REF="49">after I had &s;pent an hour in it, I walked on|wards, and came to a wood, which had private walks cut through it, and &s;trewed with &s;and.

For about three hundred yards the walk I was in extended, and then terminated in meadows, which formed an oval of twenty acres, &s;ur|rounded by groves, like the large plain I came from. Exactly in the middle of the&s;e fields, part of which were turned into gar|dens, there &s;tood a very hand&s;ome &s;tone hou&s;e, and not far from the door of it, a fountain played. On either &s;ide of the wa|ter was a garden-chair, of a very extraor|dinary make, curious and beautiful; and each of them &s;tood under an ever-green oak, the broad leaved Ilex, a charming &s;hade.</P>

I am an Engli&s;hman, Sir, but have pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of my life in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from the we&s;tern extremity of it I came. My father is one of the rich men in that kingdom, and was, for many years, the ten|dere&s;t and mo&s;t generous parent that ever &s;on was ble&s;&s;ed with. He &s;pared no co&s;t on my education, and gave me leave to draw upon him, while I re&s;ided in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin</HI> five years, for what I plea&s;ed. Ex|travagant as I was in &s;everal articles, he ne|ver &s;et any bounds to my demands, nor a&s;ked me what I did with the large &s;ums I had yearly from him. My happine&s;s was his fe|licity, and the glory of his life to have me appear to the greate&s;t advantage, and in the mo&s;t re&s;pected character, that money can gain a man.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, he married his &s;ervant maid, an artful cruel woman, who obtained by her wit and charms &s;o great an a&s;cendant over him, that he abandoned me, to rai&s;e a young nephew this &s;tepmother had, to what &s;plen|dor and power &s;he plea&s;ed. He had every thing he could name that money could pro|cure, and was ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e and land. Not a &s;hilling at this time could
<PB N="36" REF="53">I get, nor obtain the lea&s;t thing I a&s;ked for, and becau&s;e I refu&s;ed to become preceptor to this young man, and had made &s;ome altera|tion in my religion, (having renounced that creed, which was compo&s;ed, nobody knows by whom, and introduced into the church in the darke&s;t ages of popi&s;h ignorance; a &s;ymbol, which &s;trongly participates of the true nature and &s;pirit of popery, in tho&s;e &s;e|vere denunciations of God's wrath, which it pours &s;o plentifully forth again&s;t all tho&s;e who&s;e heads are not turned to believe it), my father was &s;o enraged that he would not even admit me to his table any longer, but bid me be gone. My mother-in-law likewi&s;e for ever abu&s;ed me, and her nephew, the lad, in&s;ulted me when I came in his way.</P>
<P>Being thus compelled to withdraw, I &s;et &s;ail for <HI>England</HI> as &s;oon as it was in my pow|er, and arrived in <HI>Cumberland</HI> by the force of a &s;torm. I proceeded from thence to the mountains of <HI>Stanemore,</HI> to look for a gen|tleman, my friend, who lived among tho&s;e hills; and as I journeyed over them, and mi&s;&s;ed him, I chanced to meet with a fine northern girl, and a habitation to my pur|po&s;e. I married her, and for almo&s;t two years pa&s;t was the happie&s;t of the human race, till the &s;able curtain fell between us, and the angel of death tran&s;lated her glorious &s;oul to the fields of paradi&s;e. Not able to bear the place of our re&s;idence, after I had
<PB N="37" REF="54">lo&s;t my heart's fond idol, I left the charming &s;pot and man&s;ion, where unmixed felicity had been for &s;ome time my portion, and I was travelling on towards <HI>London,</HI> to &s;ee what is ordained there in re&s;erve for me; when by accident I lo&s;t my way, and the fates conducted me to the <HI>Groves</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> Curio&s;ity led me into the library I found in the plain, without this wood, from whence, in &s;earch for &s;ome human creatures, I pro|ceeded to the fountain, where I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, Sir, and this young lady. This is a &s;ummary of my pa&s;t life; what is before me heaven only knows. My fortune I tru&s;t with the Pre&s;erver of men, and the Father of &s;pirits. One thing I am certain of by ob&s;ervation, few as the days of the years of my pilgrimage have been, that the emptine&s;s, and un&s;atisfying nature of this world's enjoyments, are enough to pre|vent my having any fondne&s;s to &s;tay in this region of darkne&s;s and &s;orrow.

The <HI>&s;keleton</HI> you &s;aw in the library was once my &s;on, <HI>Charles Henley,</HI> a mo&s;t extra|ordinary man.

Young as &s;he is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 14, 1727.</NOTE> but in the &s;econd month of her one and twentieth year, &s;he not only knows more than women of di&s;tinction generally do, but would be the admiration of learned men, if her knowledge in languages, ma|thematics, and philo&s;ophy, were known to them: and as her father taught her mu&s;ic

<P><HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> was the fir&s;t appointed token or memorial, and at the &s;ame time, an in|&s;truction in that moral rectitude to which the grace of God obliges: and when the New Te&s;tament &s;ucceeded the Law, then was the <HI>covenant intere&s;t of infants,</HI> or their <HI>right</HI> to the <HI>covenant of grace,</HI> to be confirmed by the <HI>token</HI> or <HI>&s;ign</HI> called <HI>bapti&s;m;</HI> that action being appointed to give the expected ri&s;ing generation an intere&s;t in the love of God, the grace of Chri&s;t, and the fellow&s;hip of the Holy Spirit, that is, in all covenant ble&s;|&s;ings. But what becomes of this great char|ter of heaven, if chri&s;tian women, out of an idle notion of perfection, will re&s;olve to lead &s;ingle lives, and thereby hinder ri&s;ing generations from &s;haring in the honours and privileges of the church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>ALMIGHTY and everla&s;ting God, the creator and pre&s;erver of all things, our law-giver, &s;aviour, and judge, we adore thee the author of our beings, and the father of our &s;pirits. We pre&s;ent our&s;elves, our ac|knowledgments, and our homage, at the foot of thy throne, and yield thee the thanks of the mo&s;t grateful hearts for all the in|&s;tances of thy favour which we have expe|rienced. We thank thee for ever, O Lord God Almighty, for all thy mercies and ble&s;|&s;ings
<PB N="61" REF="78">vouch&s;afed us; for defending us the pa&s;t night from evil, and for that kind pro|vi&s;ion which thou ha&s;t made for our comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in this world.</P>
<P>But above all, mo&s;t glorious Eternal, a|dored be thy goodne&s;s, for repeating and re|inforcing the laws and the religion of thy creation, by &s;upernatural revelation, and for giving us that rea&s;on of mind, which unites us to thee, and makes us implore thy com|munications of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to create us again unto good works in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>We confe&s;s, O Lord, that we have done violence to our principles, and alienated our|&s;elves from the natural u&s;e we were fitted for: we have revolted from thee into a &s;tate of &s;in, and by the operation of &s;en&s;e and pa&s;&s;ion, have been moved to &s;uch practices as are exorbitant and irregular: but we are heartily &s;orry for all our mi&s;doings: to thee in Chri&s;t we now make our addre&s;s, and be|&s;eech thee to inform our under&s;tandings, and refine our &s;pirits, that we may reform our lives by repentance, redeem our time by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and live as the glorious go&s;pel of thy Son requires. Let the divine &s;pirit a&s;&s;i&s;t and enable us to over-rule, conduct, and employ, the &s;ubordinate and inferior powers, in the exerci&s;e of virtue, and the &s;ervice of our creator, and as far as the imperfections of our pre&s;ent &s;tate will admit,
<PB N="62" REF="79">help us &s;o to live by the mea&s;ures and laws of heaven, that we may have the humility and meekne&s;s, the mortification and &s;elf-de|nial of the holy Je&s;us, his love of thee, his de&s;ire of doing thy will, and &s;eeking only thy honour. Let us not come covered before thee under a <HI>form</HI> of godline&s;s, a <HI>cloke</HI> of creeds, ob&s;ervances and in&s;titutions of reli|gion; but with that <HI>inward &s;alvation</HI> and <HI>vital &s;anctity,</HI> which renounces the &s;pirit, wi&s;dom, and honours of this world, de|thrones &s;elf-love and pride, &s;ubdues &s;en&s;ua|lity and covetou&s;ne&s;s, and <HI>opens a kingdom of heaven within</HI> by the &s;pirit of God. O let thy Chri&s;t be our Saviour in this world; and before we die, make us fit to live for ever with thee in the regions of purity and per|fection.</P>
<P>Since it is the peculiar privilege of our na|ture, through thy mercy and goodne&s;s, that we are made for an eternal entertainment in tho&s;e glorious man&s;ions, where the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of &s;aints and angels &s;hall keep an everla&s;ting &s;abbath, and adore and glorify thee for ever, let thy in&s;piring &s;pirit rai&s;e our apprehen&s;ions and de&s;ires above all things that are here below, and alienate our minds from the cu&s;toms and principles of this mad, de|generate, and apo&s;tate world: mind us of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of time, of the boundle&s;s duration, and the va&s;t importance

<P>We live, O Lord, in reconciliation and friend&s;hip, in love and good will, with thy whole creation, with every thing that de|rives from thee, holds of thee, is owned by thee; and under the power of this affection, we pray for all mankind; that they may be partakers of all the ble&s;&s;ings which we enjoy or want, and that we may all be happy in the world to come, and glorify thee together in eternity. To this end bring all the hu|man race to the knowledge of thy glorious go&s;pel, and let its influence transform them into the likene&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially, we pray for all who &s;uffer for truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, and be&s;eech thee to pro&s;per tho&s;e that love thee. Defend, O Lord, the ju&s;t rights and liberties of man|kind, and re&s;cue thy religion from the cor|ruptions which have been introduced upon it, by length of time, and by decay of piety. Infatuate the coun&s;els, and fru&s;trate the en|deavours of the prie&s;ts of <HI>Rome,</HI> and again&s;t all the de&s;igns of tho&s;e, who are enemies to

<PB N="73" REF="90">he &s;aw would be the thing) we &s;hould not con&s;tantly attend to the light we might &s;trike out our&s;elves with &s;ome trouble. He calls us in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner to for&s;ake vice and idolatry, and practi&s;e the whole &s;y&s;tem of morality. We might expect, that a good God, would once at lea&s;t, interpo&s;e by &s;uch an <HI>extraordinary</HI> method as <HI>revelation,</HI> to turn and incline his rea&s;onable creatures, to the &s;tudy and practice of the <HI>religion of nature.</HI> This was acting like the Father of the Univer&s;e, con&s;idering the negligence and cor|ruption of the bulk of mankind. The <HI>rea|&s;on</HI> he gave us, the <HI>law of nature,</HI> was giv|ing us all that was <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> The <HI>go&s;pel</HI> was an addition of what is <HI>excellently u&s;eful.</HI> What, my beloved, (might a ratio|nal divine &s;ay) can be more paternal, and worthy of the almighty Creator, than to <HI>re|veal plainly the motive of a judgment to come,</HI> in order to &s;ecure all obedience to the religion of nature? Rea&s;on may, to be &s;ure, be &s;uffi|cient to &s;hew men their duty, and to encou|rage their performance of it with the a&s;&s;u|rance of obtaining a reward, if they would duly attend to its dictates, and &s;uffer them to have their due effect upon them: it may guide mankind to virtue, and happine&s;s con|&s;equent to it, as God mu&s;t be a rewarder of all tho&s;e who diligently &s;eek him, and was enough to bring them to the knowledge, and
<PB N="74" REF="91">engage them in the practice of true religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s, if they had not &s;hut their eyes to its light, and wilfully rejected the rule written in their hearts. But as this was what mankind really did, and now do; as errors and impieties, owing to an undue u&s;e or neg|lect of rea&s;on, became univer&s;al; (ju&s;t as the ca&s;e of Chri&s;tians is, by di&s;regarding the New Te&s;tament); and rea&s;on, through men's faults, was rendered <HI>ineffectual,</HI> though &s;till <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> (which ju&s;tifies both the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> of God, in leaving man for &s;o many ages to his natural will, and &s;o great a part of the globe to this day with no other light than the law of nature); and rea&s;on, I &s;ay, was rendered <HI>ineffectual,</HI> tho' &s;till <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to teach men to wor&s;hip God with pious hearts and &s;incere affections, and to do his will by the practice of moral duties; to expect his favour for their good deeds, and his condemnation of their evil works; then was <HI>revelation</HI> a more <HI>powerful means</HI> of pro|moting true religion and godline&s;s. The go&s;|pel is a <HI>more effectual</HI> light. It is a clearer and more powerful guide: a brighter motive and &s;tronger obligation to univer&s;al obedience than rea&s;on can with certainty propo&s;e. And therefore, though there was not a nece&s;&s;ity for God to give a <HI>new rule</HI> in vindication of his providence, and in order to render men accountable to him for their actions; yet the
<PB N="75" REF="92">divine goodne&s;s was plea&s;ed to enforce the principles of rea&s;on and morality more pow|erfully by an expre&s;s &s;anction of future re|wards and puni&s;hments, and by the go&s;pel re&s;tore religious wor&s;hip to the original un|corrupted rational &s;ervice of the Deity. This di&s;plays his paternal regard to his children, with glory to him&s;elf. Love was the mov|ing principle of his &s;ending Chri&s;t into the world, to reform the corruptions of rea&s;on, to re&s;tore it to its purity, and mo&s;t effectually to promote the practice of the rules of it. The go&s;pel-revelation con&s;idered in this man|ner appears to be the pure effect of the divine goodne&s;s. It is a conduct accompanied with the greate&s;t propriety and glory.</P>
<P>If this repre&s;entation of Chri&s;tianity was as much the doctrine of the church as it is of the <HI>Ivonites</HI> I have mentioned, we might then, with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, call upon the rational infidels to come in. They could hardly refu&s;e the invitation, when we told them, our religion was the eternal law of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and of God re&s;tored, with a few ex|cellently u&s;eful additions: that the go&s;pel makes the very <HI>religion of nature,</HI> a main part of what it requires, and &s;ubmits all that it reveals to the te&s;t of the law of rea&s;on: that the &s;plendor of God's <HI>original light,</HI> the light of nature, and the revelation of Je&s;us, are the &s;ame; both made to deliver mankind
<PB N="76" REF="93">from <HI>evils</HI> and <HI>madne&s;s</HI> of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> and make their religion worthy of God, and worthy of men; to enable them, by the voice of rea&s;on in conjunction with the words of the go&s;pel, to know and wor&s;hip <HI>One God,</HI> the <HI>Maker,</HI> the <HI>Governor,</HI> the <HI>Judge,</HI> of the world; and to practi&s;e all that is good and prai&s;e-worthy: that we may be ble&s;&s;ed as we turn from iniquity to virtue; and by en|tring cordially into the &s;pirit of the <HI>merito|rious example</HI> or <HI>exemplary merits</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> be determined dead to &s;in, and alive to righteou&s;ne&s;s: in &s;hort, my brethren, in the &s;uffering and death of Je&s;us, his patient, pi|ous and meek, his benevolent and compa&s;|&s;ionate behaviour, under the mo&s;t &s;hocking in&s;ult, indignity, and torture, we have what we could not learn from the religion of na|ture, a deportment that well de&s;erves both our admiration and imitation. We learn from the <HI>perfect example</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> recom|mended in his go&s;pel, to bear patiently ill|u&s;age, and to de&s;ire the welfare of our mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and malicious enemies. This is improving by religion to the be&s;t pur|po&s;e; and as we re&s;emble the Son of God, the <HI>man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> in <HI>patience, piety,</HI> and <HI>benevolence,</HI> we become the approved chil|dren of the Mo&s;t High, who is kind and good to the unthankful and to the evil. In this view of the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> all is fine, rea&s;on|able,
<PB N="77" REF="94">and heavenly. The gentile can have nothing to object. We have the religion of nature in its original perfection, in the doc|trine of the New Te&s;tament, enforced by pains and plea&s;ures everla&s;ting; and we learn from the <HI>death</HI> of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> not only an unprecedented patience, in bearing our &s;ins in his own body on the tree; but the divine compa&s;&s;ion and piety with which he bore them. We have in this the noble&s;t example to follow, whenever called to &s;uffer for well|doing, or for righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake; and by the imitation, we manife&s;t &s;uch a command of temper and &s;pirit, as can only be the re&s;ult of the greate&s;t piety and virtue. This added to keeping the commandments mu&s;t render men the ble&s;&s;ed of the Father, and entitle them to the kingdom prepared for the wife, the ho|ne&s;t, and the excellent.</P>
<P>But, alas! in&s;tead of giving &s;uch an ac|count of chri&s;tianity, the cry of the doctors is, for the mo&s;t part, Di&s;card rea&s;on, and pro|&s;trate your under&s;tanding before the adorable my&s;teries. In&s;tead of a Supreme Independent Fir&s;t Cau&s;e of all things to believe in and wor&s;hip, they give Three true Gods in num|ber, Three infinite independent Beings, to be called One, as agreeing in one common ab|&s;tract e&s;&s;ence, or &s;pecies; as all mankind are one, in one common rational nature, or ab|&s;tract idea of humanity. Amazing account!

<P>In&s;tead of fixing &s;alvation or moral recti|tude, and our preferring the will of God, as delineated in the words of the go&s;pel, be|fore all other con&s;iderations, we are told of an innocent, meritorious, propitiating blood, &s;pilt by wicked hands, and &s;o made an ac|ceptable &s;acrifice, to a Being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. This, we are a&s;&s;ured, &s;atisfies all the demands of the law. Here is infinite &s;atisfaction:&mdash;and mo&s;t cer|tainly, I add, a cool indifference as to per|&s;onal rectitude.

<P>The fir&s;t book I chanced to open in this library, was the &s;econd volume of <HI>Severin Bini</HI>'s edition of the Councils,<NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Severin Bini,</HI> or <HI>Binius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of coun|cils, and the editors of them.</NOTE> as he is commonly cal|led, was a doctor of divinity at <HI>Cologne,</HI> in the circle of the <HI>Lower Rhine</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and canon of that ar|chiepi&s;copal cathedral. He publi&s;hed in that city, in the year 1606, an elegant edition of all the councils in four very large volumes, folio, and by this work, made the editions or collections of <HI>James Merlin, Pe|ter Crabb,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Surius,</HI> of no value: but the 2d edition publi&s;hed by <HI>Binius</HI> in the year 1618, in nine volumes &s;maller folio, is far preferable to the fir&s;t: and the Paris Edition of <HI>Bini</HI>'s <HI>Councils</HI> in 1638, in ten large volumes, folio, is enlarged, more correct, and of con|&s;equence &s;till better than the 2d edition of <HI>Binius.</HI> This is not however the be&s;t edition to buy, if you love to read that <HI>theological &s;tuff</HI> called Councils.

<P>N. B. <HI>Binius,</HI> whom I have mentioned, was born in the year 1543, and died 1620, aet. 77.</P>

<P>N. B. <HI>Peter Crabb,</HI> the 2d editor of the councils, was a Franci&s;can friar. He publi&s;hed two volumes in folio of Councils, at <HI>Cologne,</HI> in 1538; and a third vo|lume in 1550.&mdash;Was born 1470; died 1553; aet. 83.</P>

<P>N.

<PB N="82" REF="99">of digre&s;&s;ions. His commentaries, for the mo&s;t part, are weak. I am &s;ure he did not under&s;tand <HI>St. Paul.</HI> But, for the 12th century, he was an extraordinary man.</P>
<P>But who was <HI>St. Victor,</HI> to whom the <HI>abbey</HI> of <HI>Cha|noines Regulieres</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and the greater <HI>abbaye</HI> of <HI>Chanoines</HI> in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> are dedicated?

William Grimaud, abbot</HI> of <HI>St. Victor de Mar&s;eille,</HI> on his being made <HI>Pope Urban</HI> the 5th, A.

His works are 183 letters on various &s;ubjects, 20 &s;ermons, and 17 tracts of &s;everal kinds. They were fir&s;t printed at <HI>Mayence</HI> in 1500.&mdash; Then by <HI>Merlin, Paris,</HI> 1519, as before mentioned.&mdash; Afterwards, <HI>John Bu&s;&eacute;e,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> gave an edition of
<PB N="83" REF="100">them in 1600, which is far preferable to that of <HI>Mer|lin.</HI> But the mo&s;t valuable edition is that of <HI>Peter de Gou&s;&s;ainville,</HI> in folio, <HI>Paris,</HI> 1667: to this edition is prefixed the <HI>life</HI> of <HI>Peter de Blois,</HI> and very learned re|marks on <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>writings,</HI> and the &s;ubjects he writ on, are added, by <HI>Gou&s;&s;ainville. De Blois</HI>'s works contain many excellent things, and his life is a curious piece. Some of his notions relating to the &s;criptures are very good, and he writes well again&s;t vice. He is a good author for the age he lived in. His letters are well worth reading; e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as relate to his own time. King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd ordered him to make a collection of them for his (the king's) u&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Durand de St. Pour&ccedil;ain,</HI> was <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Meux,</HI> in 1326, and died the 13th of <HI>September,</HI> 1333, in the 89th year of his age. His works are, <HI>Liber de origine juri&s;dictionum,</HI> (a learned piece); and <HI>Commentaries on the four books of &s;entences.</HI> (The book called, <HI>The Sen|tences,</HI> was written by the famous <HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> bi|&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who died in the year 1164. aet. 82. In the <HI>Sentences,</HI> one of the propo&s;itions argued on is this: <HI>Chri&s;tus &s;ecundum quod e&s;t homo, non e&s;t aliquod.</HI> Some call the&s;e <HI>Sentences</HI> excellent, which is what I cannot think them: but in <HI>Durand's Commentary</HI> on them, there are &s;everal excellent things.)</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Je&s;uit, Jean Bu&s;&eacute;e,</HI> (who publi&s;hed the 3d edition of <HI>Peter de Blois</HI>) he died at <HI>Mayence</HI> the 30th of <HI>May,</HI> 1611, aged 64, and was the author of many books not worth mentioning.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Gou&s;&s;ainville</HI> (who printed the la&s;t edi|tion of <HI>De Blois,</HI> with notes, and the life) died in the year 1683, extremely poor and mi&s;erable. He like|wi&s;e

<P N="3">3. As <HI>rhetorical apo&s;trophes,</HI> or <HI>pro&s;opo|paeias,</HI> are u&s;ual in all authors, &s;acred or civil, this may be one in <HI>Cyril,</HI> and it &s;eems very plain from the pa&s;&s;age, that it was intended for no more.

<P><HI>Cyril</HI> intending, as appears by the &s;equel, to an&s;wer his own que&s;tion with a pa&s;&s;age in St. <HI>John</HI>'s go&s;pel, makes a long <HI>rhetorical apo&s;trophe</HI> to the <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> as if he were there pre&s;ent, then adds, Annon dicentem audimus, <GAP DESC="foreign">? <HI>But do we not hear him &s;aying?</HI> Or, as <HI>Binius</HI> has the reading, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>let us hear what St. John &s;aith,</HI> audiamus itaque dicentem, as if they had heard <HI>John</HI> giving his an&s;wer, and then concludes with the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the fir&s;t chapter of his go&s;pel, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>It is therefore very plain, that this pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Cyril</HI> is only a part of his homily or &s;er|mon,
<PB N="90" REF="107">and that in a rhetorical manner, he quotes a text from a go&s;pel written by <HI>John</HI> about 330 years before, in an&s;wer to his own que&s;tion, who the word was?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 8, 1729, we leave the religious, and pro|ceed in the journey.</NOTE>&sect;. 1. THE eighth of <HI>April,</HI> 1729, I bid the <HI>Ivonites</HI> adieu, and by their directions walked up a very &s;teep and &s;tony mountain, which took me two hours, and then arrived at what I had often &s;een before in this part of the world, a great lake, the
<PB N="99" REF="116">water of which was black as ink to look at as it &s;tood, though very bright in a cup, and mu&s;t be owing, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to its de&s;cend|ing to the aby&s;s: by the &s;ide of this water, under the &s;hade of oak-trees, many hundred years old, we rid for an hour, on even ground, and then came to a de&s;cent &s;o very dangerous and dark, through a wood on the mountain's &s;ide, that we could hardly creep it down on our feet, nor our hor&s;es keep their legs as we led them to the bottom. This declivity was more than a mile, and ended in a narrow lane between a range of precipices that almo&s;t met at top. This pa&s;s was knee-deep in water, from a &s;pring in the bottom of the mountain we had come down, which ran through it, and &s;o very &s;tony, that it took us three hours to walk the hor&s;es to the end of it, though it was not more than two miles: but at la&s;t we came to a fine plain, over which we rid for an hour and a half, and arrived at a wood, which &s;eemed very large, and &s;tood between two very high unpa&s;&s;able hills. In this fore&s;t was our way, and the road &s;o dark, and ob&s;tructed by the branches of trees, that it was di&s;mal and un|ea&s;y to go. On however we went for a long time, and about the middle of it came to a circular opening of about four acres, in which four very narrow roads met; that we had travelled, another before us, and one on
<PB N="100" REF="117">each hand. The way &s;trait on we were cautioned by my friends not to go, as it was a terrible ride; but whether to turn to the right or left, we had forgot. I thought to the right; but my lad was po&s;itive, he re|membered the directions was to take the left|hand road. This cau&s;ed a &s;top for &s;ome time, and as I was a little fatigued, I thought it be&s;t while we pau&s;ed to dine. <HI>Finn</HI> brought immediately &s;ome meat, bread, and a bottle of cyder, from his vali&s;e, and under a great oak I &s;at down, while our hor&s;es fed on the green. One hour we re&s;ted, and then went on again, to the left, as <HI>O Finn</HI> advi&s;ed. For &s;everal hours we rid, or rather, our hor&s;es walked, till we got out of the wood, and then arrived at the bottom of a &s;teep moun|tain; one &s;ide of which is in the northern extremity of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and the other in the north end of <HI>Stanemore-Richmond&s;hire.</HI> This va&s;t hill we a&s;cended, and came down the other &s;ide of the fell into a plain, which extends &s;outh-ea&s;t for near half a mile to the river <HI>Tee&s;e,</HI> that divides the north end of <HI>Stanemore</HI> from Bi&s;hoprick, or the county of <HI>Durham. York&s;hire</HI> here ends in an ob|tu&s;e angle, between two mountains, and the angle, for a quarter of a mile, is filled with that beautiful tall ever-green tree, the broad|leaved <HI>alaternus,</HI> intermixed here and there in a charming manner, with the fir tree,

This change in religion gave <HI>Dorick</HI> the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, (as he told me) and it was doubled by his being able to convert his beloved <HI>Adelaide</HI> from popery to the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But this joy had &s;oon after &s;ome mitigation, by lo&s;ing one of the mo&s;t agree|able women in the world. Death robbed him of his heart's fond idol, and by that &s;troke he was &s;o wounded, that he could not heal him&s;elf for a long time. He became the real <HI>mourner.</HI> He kept the rea&s;ons of his angui&s;h continually before him, and was more intent upon &s;pending his &s;pirits, than his &s;orrows. He grew fond of &s;olitude and &s;ilence, that he might indulge his pa&s;&s;ion, and provoke the emotion of that grief that was ready to devour him. In &s;hort, he re|treated to the &s;ilent place I found him in, which was a part of his own e&s;tate, and turned <HI>hermit.</HI> He built the little villa I &s;aw by the water-&s;ide, and formed the ground into the natural garden I beheld. <HI>Le Blanc</HI> mentions it in his letters, as an extraordinary thing, and very ju&s;tly prefers it to the labour|ed and expen&s;ive Gardens at <HI>Chi&s;wick,</HI> the work of the late Lord <HI>Burlington,</HI> Here <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> laid in every thing he had a mind for, and filled his clo&s;et with books.

<PB N="114" REF="131">of the be&s;t learning, which is the true chri&s;tian; and from that he went to know what the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> have re&s;olved and taught. In &s;ome things, I found he was a learned agreeable man, and won|dered greatly at his whim in turning hermit. I &s;aid a great deal again&s;t it, as we &s;at over a bottle of claret; told him he might employ his time and talents more u&s;efully in the world, by mixing and conver&s;ing with his fellow creatures, and by a mutual participa|tion and conveyance of the common ble&s;&s;ings of nature and providence; and as he was not forty yet, advi&s;ed him to go over the <HI>Tee&s;e,</HI> and make his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s <HI>Cranmer</HI> or Mi&s;s <HI>Vane,</HI> both of them being mo&s;t glorious girls, as I was told, and capable of adding greatly to the delights of philo&s;ophy.

For my own part, I had rather marry, and double-rib one of the&s;e dear creatures, than die with the character of a father of the de&s;arts. But in vain did I re|mon&s;trate to this anchoret.

It was the de&s;ire of a change e&s;tabli&s;hed the reformation. The new doctors
<PB N="119" REF="136">&s;educed the people, and the people having mi&s;taken darkne&s;s for light, quitted the road of truth, to walk in the ways of error.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to morals, that this boa&s;ted reforma|tion produced no change in that re&s;pect; for the people are not purer than they were in former times, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tics are de&s;pi&s;ed and hated for the badne&s;s of their lives. The bi&s;hops &s;acrifice every thing to their ambition; and the clergy of the &s;econd rank have no re&s;pect for their office. They &s;pend the whole day in public places in &s;moaking and drinking, and are remarkable for drunken|ne&s;s, &s;o di&s;honourable to eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Their
<PB N="120" REF="137">talk is the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute, and the vice that degrades the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, &s;ets a bad example to &s;ober people, and makes them the je&s;t of libertines.</P>
<P N="3">3. The only remarkable change produced by the reformation was the marriage of prie&s;ts; and, exclu&s;ive of this being again&s;t the deci|&s;ions of the catholic church, it is contrary to &s;ound policy and experience. The marriage of prie&s;ts dimini&s;hes the re&s;pect we &s;hould have for them. The mi&s;conduct of a wo|man makes the clergyman fall into contempt. The lewdne&s;s of the daughter makes the prie&s;t, her father, the object of the mo&s;t in|decent je&s;ts; and for the mo&s;t part, the daugh|ters of the clergy turn whores after the death of their father; who, while living, &s;pent more of his income in maintaining him&s;elf and children in plea&s;ure and luxury, than in works of charity. He lived profu&s;ely, and dies poor.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> clergy were the greate&s;t and mo&s;t excellent men, yet a great man in the eyes of the world, lo&s;es of the re&s;pect which is due to him, in proportion as he has any thing in common with the re&s;t of mankind. A <HI>Madam Newton,</HI> and a <HI>Madam Fontenelle,</HI> would injure the illu&s;trious men who&s;e name they bore. Nor is this all. Tho&s;e who by their di&s;po&s;ition cannot fix that &s;ecret
<PB N="121" REF="138">inclination, which induces us to love, on one per&s;on, are more humane and charitable than others. The unmarried eccle&s;ia&s;tics are more animated with that charitable &s;pirit their function requires, as they have no worldly affections to divert it. People very rarely (as Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> &s;ays) employ them&s;elves in watering plants, when they want water them|&s;elves. &mdash;In &s;hort, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> divines are the wor&s;t of men, and there is hardly any reli|gion in <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;Thus does this <HI>French</HI> Abb&eacute; revile the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reformation and di|vines. He mi&s;repre&s;ents the whole nation, and with a fal&s;hood and outrage peculiar to <HI>popery</HI> and <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;ts,</HI> that is, to devils and the mo&s;t execrable religion, &s;creams again&s;t the pure religion of the go&s;pel, and di&s;hone&s;tly blackens &s;ome of the fine&s;t characters that ever adorned human nature. So very vi|rulent is this reverend <HI>French</HI> papi&s;t again&s;t the clergy of <HI>England,</HI> that he is even po&s;i|tive there is not a divine in the nation knows how to behave like a gentleman.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the fir&s;t article of impeach|ment, I ob&s;erve, that it is &s;o far from being true, that <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> divines, <HI>our reformers,</HI> were enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and compa&s;&s;ed their de&s;igns by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who were animated by a &s;pirit of irreligion, and by a greedy de&s;ire of &s;eizing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="122" REF="139">the monks, (as this <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;t</HI> a&s;&s;erts); that it is mo&s;t certain, on the contrary, <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and the other <HI>reformers,</HI> were wi&s;e and up|right chri&s;tians, who, from a good under|&s;tanding of religion, oppo&s;ed the <HI>fal&s;e preten|&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> They &s;aw that popery was contrary to the true genius of chri&s;tianity; its &s;pirit in&s;olent and cruel; and its wor&s;hip, not only a jumble of the mo&s;t ridiculous fopperies and extravagancies, bor|rowed from heathen cu&s;toms and &s;uper&s;ti|tions; but the impure&s;t that ever appeared in the world: that the <HI>de&s;igns</HI> of <HI>popi&s;h Rome</HI> were contrary to all the <HI>principles</HI> of <HI>humani|ty;</HI> its <HI>doctrines abominable</HI> and <HI>&s;inful;</HI> and its <HI>offices cur&s;ed</HI> and <HI>diabolical:</HI> it was evident, I &s;ay, to the conception of the&s;e great men, (I mean <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and the other <HI>Engli&s;h re|formers</HI>) that the <HI>Romi&s;h church</HI> was <HI>treache|rous</HI> and <HI>inhuman, blood-thir&s;ty</HI> and <HI>antichri&s;|tian;</HI> that her devotions were horrible and impious; her mini&s;ters <HI>fal&s;e prophets</HI> and <HI>liars,</HI> covered and decked with the livery of Chri&s;t, but in every thing acting contrary to the &s;al|vation wrought by Je&s;us; and therefore the&s;e wi&s;e and excellent <HI>reformers</HI> renounced <HI>popery,</HI> and bravely declared for that religion, which promotes the good of all mankind, and in|&s;pires men to <HI>wor&s;hip the Father only in &s;pirit</HI> and <HI>in truth.</HI> They threw off the cloak and garments of antichri&s;t: they gloriou&s;ly &s;epa|rated
<PB N="123" REF="140">from him, and joined together in <HI>pu|rity</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> to <HI>plea&s;e the Lord Jehovah.</HI> There was no enthu&s;ia&s;m in the ca&s;e, (as <HI>Le Blanc,</HI> the <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;t,</HI> has the front to &s;ay) but, when the light of the go&s;pel was ob|&s;cured, and darkne&s;s had over&s;pread the earth; when ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition uni|ver&s;ally prevailed, and the <HI>immoralities</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> were made to pa&s;s for chri&s;|tianity in the world; then did the&s;e <HI>reformers</HI> call the people out of <HI>Rome,</HI> and preach to them the e&s;&s;ential truths of the faith. They called them from an idolatrous religion, and all its train of direful effects; from that &s;in of the fir&s;t rank, which &s;trikes at the being of a God, and ravi&s;hes from him the greate&s;t honour that is due to him from his creature, man; they called them from the horrible &s;ervice of the ma&s;s, from their addre&s;&s;es to angels and &s;aints, and their wor&s;hip of ima|ges; to the inward knowledge of one true God, and the wor&s;hip due to him only; to the &s;anctification and honour, which is due to him above all things, and above every name; to the living hope in God through Chri&s;t; to regeneration, and inward renova|tion by faith, hope, and charity; to a holy conver&s;ation, and a faithful performance of all the commandments; to true repentance, per&s;everance to the end, and life eternal. To the&s;e <HI>truths,</HI> (not to be found in the re|ligion
<PB N="124" REF="141">of our travelling <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;t</HI>) did the great, the glorious <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reformers call mankind. They laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h them in every thing tending to a pure faith, and good life. In this, there is not, there can|not be any enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>And as to their being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e who were animated by a &s;pirit of irreligion, and by a greedy de&s;ire of &s;eizing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the monks, it does not appear to be the truth of the ca&s;e. Suppo&s;ing there were &s;uch irreligious men, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance the <HI>re|formers</HI> had from any great men in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time, when the abbeys were de|&s;troyed, was &s;o very little, that malice only could mention it as an objection to the refor|mation. Popery, in that monarch's reign, was &s;till the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of <HI>England,</HI> and both &s;ides blame this king's <HI>per&s;ecutions.</HI> If <HI>papi&s;ts</HI> were put to death for denying the <HI>&s;upremacy</HI> of <HI>Harry, prote&s;tants</HI> were no le&s;s &s;ufferers, for oppo&s;ing the adoration of the ho&s;t, and other religious impieties. And af|ter the &s;hort reign of his &s;on, <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, what a&s;&s;i&s;tance had the <HI>reformers</HI> un|der <HI>bloody Mary?</HI> Did &s;he not do all that <HI>in|fernal popery</HI> could &s;ugge&s;t, to de&s;troy <HI>Cran|mer,</HI> his brethren, and their reformation? And did not they, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance than what they received from the &s;pirit of God, continue to vindicate the <HI>truth as it is in
<PB N="125" REF="142">Je&s;us,</HI> and teach the pure doctrines of the go&s;pel, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>frauds</HI> and <HI>vile inventions</HI> of <HI>papal Rome.</HI> Without mind|ing the indignities, the torments, and the cruel death prepared for them, the <HI>brave ho|ne&s;t men</HI> went on with their heavenly work, and till, the flames made them &s;ilent, endea|voured to de&s;troy the <HI>Romi&s;h artifices</HI> and <HI>im|moralities,</HI> and to &s;pread the <HI>pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father.</HI> They were zealous, with the truth of religion on their &s;ide, and laboured to convert, out of a pure and friendly regard to the eternal wel|fare of mankind. They did the work, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and therefore the malicious <HI>Le Blanc,</HI> the <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;t,</HI> reviles and black|ens them.</P>
<P>What he &s;ays of <HI>u&s;urpation,</HI> in re&s;pect of church lands, does not de&s;erve any notice. The reforming clergy were not the actors in that &s;cene. It was the king and his council. And as the Pope had &s;hewed them the way, by granting <HI>bulls for the di&s;&s;olution of the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries,</HI> they thought, &s;ince the Pope's power was taken away by a general con&s;ent of the nation, the king, the church, and the people concurring, they might, with as little <HI>&s;acrilege,</HI> di&s;&s;olve the re&s;t. The king and parliament (&s;ays Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI>) could not di&s;cern the difference between greater and le&s;&s;er as to the point of <HI>&s;acrilege.</HI> And al|though
<PB N="126" REF="143">&s;ome u&s;es might cea&s;e by the doctrines of the reformation, as ma&s;&s;es for &s;ouls de|parted, and monks to pray the dead out of purgatory; yet there were others to employ the church lands about, as &s;ome of them were in founding <HI>new bi&s;hopricks.</HI> And if in this ca&s;e, the reformers had been guilty of &s;ome wilful errors, that could be no crime of the reformation. The culpable mu&s;t an|&s;wer it. For the &s;atisfaction of con&s;cience about the reformation, there can be but three que&s;tions fairly propo&s;ed. Was there &s;uffi|cient cau&s;e for it? Was there &s;ufficient au|thority? And whether the proceedings of our reformation were ju&s;tifiable by the rule of &s;cripture, and the ancient church? Upon the&s;e points we ought to join i&s;&s;ue, and I am &s;ure the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be in the affirma|tive.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Le Blanc</HI>'s &s;econd ob&s;ervation in re|lation to the <HI>marriage of prie&s;ts,</HI> which our <HI>reformation</HI> he &s;ays produced, it may be an|&s;wered, that the doctrine of a <HI>prie&s;t's mar|riage being unlawful,</HI> was borrowed by the church of <HI>Rome</HI> from the antient heretics; e&s;pecially from the <HI>Manichees,</HI> who allowed marriage to their hearers, as the church of <HI>Rome</HI> doth to laymen; but forbad it to their <HI>elect,</HI> as that church doth to her <HI>prie&s;ts.</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> charges the <HI>Manichees</HI> wth this error. Hic non dubito vos e&s;&s;e clamaturos invidiam|que

<P>The fir&s;t <HI>pope</HI> we read of that condemned the <HI>marriage</HI> of <HI>prie&s;ts,</HI> was <HI>Syricius,</HI> the <HI>Ro|man,</HI> A. D. 384&mdash;398. And upon this ac|count, I wonder <HI>Baronius</HI> had not a regard to his memory: but it has been the misfor|tune of his <HI>holine&s;s</HI> &s;ince his death to fall un|der the di&s;plea&s;ure of the <HI>Cardinal</HI> to that de|gree, that he has &s;truck him out of his cata|logue of his <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> &s;aints. He does not tell us for what rea&s;on. Perhaps it was becau&s;e this pope rather di&s;&s;uaded prie&s;ts from mar|riage than peremptorily forbad it, as appears by his letters. (Syr. epi&s;t. 1. &amp; 4. apud Bi|nium.)</P>
<P>The next <HI>pope,</HI> who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>marriage</HI> of <HI>prie&s;ts,</HI> was the &s;on of <HI>Bald-head,</HI> count of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> (who&s;e grand|daughter was con&s;ort to <HI>Lewis</HI> the 6th, king of <HI>France</HI>); I mean the celebrated <HI>Guy,</HI> arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Vienne,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Gela&s;ius,</HI> A. D. 1119, and had for &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the year 1124, <HI>Lambert</HI> of <HI>Bononia,</HI> commonly call|ed <HI>Honorius</HI> the &s;econd. <HI>Calixtus</HI> the &s;econd, pope and prince of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> was the fir&s;t
<PB N="128" REF="145">who ab&s;olutely forbad <HI>prie&s;ts marriage,</HI> and in ca&s;e they were married, commanded them to be &s;eparated. (Grat. di&s;t. 27. c. 8.) This was in the beginning of the twelfth century. And towards the end of it, A. D. 1198, the renowned &s;on of Count <HI>Tra&s;imund,</HI> I mean <HI>Innocent</HI> the third, the ever memorable Car|dinal <HI>Lotharius,</HI> pronounced all the <HI>marriages</HI> of <HI>prie&s;ts null.</HI> And afterwards came on the <HI>council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> A. D. 1545&mdash;1563, which anathematizes tho&s;e who &s;ay &s;uch marriages are valid. (Se&s;&s;. 24. can. 9.)</P>
<P>But one would think, that God &s;ufficiently declared his approbation of &s;uch marriages, in that the whole world hath by his appointment been twice peopled by two married prie&s;ts; fir&s;t by <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;econdly by <HI>Noah.</HI> And we are &s;ure, the holy <HI>&s;cripture</HI> tells us, <HI>That mar|riage is honourable in all;</HI> (Heb. xiii. 4) and places it among the qualifications of a bi&s;hop, <HI>That he be the hu&s;band of one wife, having faithful children.</HI> (Tit. i. 6.) <HI>This,</HI> &s;aith St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom, the apo&s;tle pre&s;cribed to this end, that he might &s;top the mouths of hereticks, who reproached marriage; declaring thereby that marriage is no unclean thing, but &s;o honourable, that a married man may be exalted to the &s;acred throne of a bi&s;hop.</HI> (Chry&s;o&s;t. hom. 2. in c. 1. ad tit.) What do you &s;ay to this, <HI>Le Blanc?</HI> I fancy you never read this <HI>homily</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="146">of <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tome.</HI> &mdash; And well might this &s;aint think it not unbecoming a <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> to <HI>marry,</HI> when our <HI>Lord</HI> thought it not <HI>un|becoming</HI> an <HI>apo&s;tle,</HI> no not the prince of the apo&s;tles (as the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> will have him), for it is without doubt, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> was married; in that the &s;cripture makes mention of his wife's mother. (<HI>Matt.</HI> viii. 14.) And <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> tells us, that it was certainly reported, that when he &s;aw his wi&s;e led to death, he rejoiced; and having exhorted her and comforted her, he called her by her name, and bid her remember the Lord. (<HI>Clemens Alex. Stromat.</HI> l. 7. p. 736. lut. 1629.) And that he was not only mar|ried, but begat children, the &s;ame <HI>Clemens</HI> in another place affirms, (<HI>Stromat.</HI> l. 3. p. 448.) Yea that St. <HI>Philip</HI> and St. <HI>Jude</HI> were al&s;o married, and had children, <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> is wit|ne&s;s. (<HI>Eu&s;eb.</HI> eccle&s;. hi&s;t. l. 3. c. 20&mdash;31.) And in like manner we find, that many of the primitive bi&s;hops were married. <HI>Chare|mon</HI> bi&s;hop of <HI>Nilus,</HI> St. <HI>Spiridion,</HI> St. <HI>Gre|gory Nazianzen,</HI> St. <HI>Gregory Ny&s;&s;en,</HI> St. <HI>Hi|lary,</HI> and many more, were married men.</P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;aid, that they took wives while they were laymen, and after they took upon them the &s;acred mini&s;try, were &s;epa|rated from them; &s;ince the <HI>canons,</HI> commonly called the apo&s;tles, did prohibit either bi&s;hop, prie&s;t, or deacon, to put away his wife upon
<PB N="130" REF="147">pretence of religion. (See canon 5.) And if any &s;uch &s;hall ab&s;tain from marriage, as in it&s;elf abominable, command that he be corrected, or depo&s;ed, and ca&s;t out of the church. (Canon 50.)</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e <HI>canons</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing all that <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> has &s;aid) were not made by them who&s;e name they bear, yet they are allowed by all to be of much greater anti|quity than the fir&s;t <HI>Nicene</HI> council. And when in that council it was moved, that <HI>bi|&s;hops</HI> and <HI>prie&s;ts, deacons</HI> and <HI>&s;ub-deacons,</HI> might not cohabit with their wives, which they had taken before ordination, the <HI>motion</HI> was pre|&s;ently da&s;hed by the famous <HI>Paphnutius,</HI> who was him&s;elf a &s;ingle per&s;on. (<HI>Socrat.</HI> eccles. hi&s;t. l. 1. c. 11.) Yea a long time after this council, we meet with many <HI>popes,</HI> who were <HI>&s;ons</HI> of <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>prie&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Pope <HI>Theodorus, Silverius,</HI> and <HI>Gela&s;ius</HI> I. were the &s;ons of bi&s;hops: pope <HI>Boniface</HI> I. <HI>Felix</HI> II. and <HI>Agapetus</HI> II. were the &s;ons of prie&s;ts. (<HI>Gratian.</HI> di&s;t. 56. c. 2.) and that we may not think this &s;trange, <HI>Gratian</HI> him|&s;elf informs us, that the marriage of prie&s;ts was in tho&s;e days lawful in the Latin church. (Di&s;t. 56. c. 12.)</P>
<P>Nor is this doctrine to be rejected only as contrary to &s;cripture, and to primitive and apo&s;tolical practice, but becau&s;e of the abo|minable fruits produced in the church of
<PB N="131" REF="148"><HI>Rome</HI> by it. For when the clergy might not have wives, (which God allowed), in&s;tead of them they took whores; and that wicked|ne&s;s &s;o far prevailed in the church, that the Cardinal of <HI>Cambray</HI> informs us, (De reform. eccle&s;.) many clergymen were not a&s;hamed publickly, in the face of the world, to keep concubines. And the glo&s;s upon <HI>Gratian</HI> &s;ays, A prie&s;t may not be depo&s;ed for &s;imple fornication, becau&s;e there are few prie&s;ts to be found without that fault. This made <HI>Pius</HI> the &s;econd &s;ay, that though prie&s;ts were by the we&s;tern church forbid to marry for good rea&s;on, yet there was &s;tronger rea&s;on to re&s;tore marriage to them again. (Hi&s;t. Coun|cil Trent. l. 7. p. 680.) And many in that council, were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that they alledged the great &s;candal given by inconti|nent prie&s;ts, and that there was want of con|tinent per&s;ons fit to exerci&s;e the mini&s;try. (<HI>Paoli,</HI> p. 679. &amp;c.) The Emperor and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> did therefore require, that the marriage of prie&s;ts might be granted. (<HI>Paoli,</HI> p. 680. &amp;c.) And many bi&s;hops de&s;ired that married per&s;ons might be pro|moted to holy orders; but this reque&s;t was not granted, becau&s;e, as the fathers ob&s;erved, if the clergy once come to be married, they will no longer depend on the Pope, but on their prince.</P>

To conclude this article, (and I &s;hall do it in the words of a great man, a prelate of the church of <HI>England,</HI> now living); To make war again&s;t the very Being of their &s;pecies, they, (the <HI>Romi&s;h prie&s;ts</HI>) devote them&s;elves to a &s;ingle life, in bla&s;phemous oppo&s;ition to that fir&s;t great command and ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>increa&s;e and multiply.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Le Blanc</HI>'s third ob&s;ervation, relat|ing to the immoralities and bad behaviour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> clergy; I an&s;wer, if there are &s;e|veral bad men among &s;o large a body as the prote&s;tant divines are, which is not &s;trange, as it is the common ca&s;e of all &s;ocieties, yet the majority of them, orthodox and other dox, are as worthy men as can be found among the human race. I am very &s;ure my acquaintance among them has been much larger than <HI>Le Blanc</HI>'s could po&s;&s;ibly be; and I can affirm from my own knowledge, that there are very many of this order of men, not only as fine gentlemen as I have ever conver&s;ed with; but, a clergy holy in heart; &s;uperior to pride, to anger, to fooli&s;h de&s;ires; who walk as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> al&s;o walked, and by their <HI>example</HI> and <HI>doctrine,</HI> labour to make the people what the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> requires they &s;hould be; that is, pious and u&s;eful, pure and ho|ne&s;t, meek and charitable; to walk by faith, and not by &s;ight; and &s;o pa&s;s through things temporal, that they may be &s;ure of obtaining
<PB N="133" REF="150">the things eternal. This I can &s;ay of many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> divines of my acquaintance: and I may add, that this te&s;timony from me, who am not over-fond of the clergy, (as the main of the chri&s;tianity of too many of them lies in their opinion; decked with a few outward ob&s;ervances, &s;ays Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> very truly, in his letter to Bi&s;hop <HI>Warburton</HI>) and only upon occa&s;ion, endeavour now to do them ju&s;tice, is certainly of more weight in their favour, than the calumny and abu&s;e of a <HI>furious bi|got</HI> and ma&s;s-prie&s;t, can be to make the world have as bad an opinion of them, as <HI>popery,</HI> and its wretched emi&s;&s;aries, would have the public entertain.

<P>On the other hand, I have had a very large and intimate acquaintance with <HI>ma&s;s-prie&s;ts</HI> in my time, in many parts of the world; and, a few excellent ones excepted, I can affirm, that more wicked and more worth|le&s;s men than the&s;e <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> monks, I have never &s;een.

<P><PB N="135" REF="152">
Immediately then I cro&s;&s;ed the water, went up to the hou&s;e, and as I &s;aw her and the fair <HI>Agne&s;s,</HI> her cou&s;in, walking in the garden, near the <HI>ha,</HI> leaped it over immedi|ately, broad as it was, and with my hat in my hand, made her a low bow, be|gan an apology for pre&s;uming to introduce my&s;elf to her pre&s;ence in &s;uch a manner, and concluded with my being in love with her charming character, before I had the honour and happine&s;s of &s;eeing her. What a con|dition then mu&s;t I be in, when a heaven-born maid, like her, appeared! Strange plea&s;ures filled my &s;oul, unloo&s;ed my tongue,
<PB N="136" REF="153">and my fir&s;t talk could not be any thing but love. A deal I &s;aid on the &s;ubject, not worth repeating to the reader; and the i&s;&s;ue of the matter was, that I became &s;o well ac|quainted with this <HI>innocent beauty,</HI> that, on tak|ing my leave, I had an invitation to breakfa&s;t with her the next morning. I was there by eight, and really and truly quite charmed with her. She was pretty as it was po&s;&s;ible for fle&s;h and blood to be, had a beautiful un|der&s;tanding; and as &s;he had very little notion of men, having &s;een very few, except the two old &s;ervants who lived with her, &s;he had not a notion of any danger that could come from conver&s;ing freely with a man &s;he knew nothing of, and who might be an ene|my in di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, I offered to go, but &s;he a&s;ked me to &s;tay and dine; and to &s;um up the matter, I did dine, &s;up, and break|fa&s;t with her every day, for a month, till my good prie&s;t, <HI>Friar Fleming,</HI> arrived, on a letter I had &s;ent him, and we were married before the end of &s;ix weeks. We loved to exce&s;s, and did enhance human happine&s;s to a high degree. She was good as an an|gel; and for two years we lived in un&s;peak|able felicity. For the greate&s;t part of that time, we were at <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> as &s;he liked the wild place. There &s;he likewi&s;e died of the &s;mall-pox, in the fir&s;t month of the
<PB N="137" REF="154" MS="y">third year, and left me the mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate of men. Four days I &s;at with my eyes &s;hut, on account of this lo&s;s, and then left the <HI>Lodge</HI> once more, to live if I could, &s;ince my religion ordered me &s;o to do, and &s;ee what I was next to meet with in the world. As grief &s;at powerfully on my &s;pirits, and if not di&s;lodged, would have drank them all up very &s;oon, I re&s;olved to ha&s;ten to <HI>Harrogate,</HI> and in the fe&s;tivities of that place forget my departed partner as &s;oon as I could. I laid my <HI>Antonia</HI> by my <HI>Charlotte</HI> and my <HI>Statia,</HI> and then rode off.

<P>N. B. As I mention nothing of any chil|dren by &s;o many wives, &s;ome readers may perhaps wonder at this, and therefore, to give a general an&s;wer, once for all, I think it &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that I had a great many, to carry on the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion;</HI> but as they never were concerned in any extraordinary affairs, nor ever did any remarkable things, that I heard of; &mdash; only ri&s;e and breakfa&s;t, read and &s;aunter, drink and eat, it would not be fair, in my opinion, to make any one pay for their hi&s;tory.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The au|thor goes to <HI>Harro|gate.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 1. IN the year 1731, I arrived at <HI>Har|rogate,</HI> in the We&s;t-riding of <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI> in order to amu&s;e my mind with the
<PB N="139" REF="156">diver&s;ions and company of the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac|count of the place, the wells, and com|pany.</NOTE> It is a &s;mall &s;traggling village on a heath, two miles from <HI>Knare&s;borough,</HI> which is thirteen miles from <HI>York,</HI> and 175 from <HI>London.</HI> The &s;ulphur wells are three, on the north &s;ide of the town, about 500 yards ea&s;t of the bog. They ri&s;e out of a little dry hill. The &s;econd is a yard from the fir&s;t, and the third is five yards and a half from the &s;econd. The wa|ter ri&s;es into &s;tone-ba&s;ons, which are each in|clo&s;ed in a &s;mall neat building of &s;tone and lime a yard &s;quare on the in&s;ides, and two yards high, covered over with thick flag|&s;tones laid &s;helving.</P>
<P>The &s;oil out of which the&s;e &s;prings ri&s;e is, fir&s;t, corn-mould, then a marle lime-&s;tone, and a &s;tratum of plai&s;ter: the lime-&s;tone is &s;o abraded by the &s;alt in the water, that when dried, it &s;wims: and where the water &s;tag|nates between the ba&s;ons and the brook, the earth is ink black, and has a dry white &s;cum, which &s;mells like &s;ulphur, and burns with a blue flame. The water does likewi&s;e throw up much candied &s;ea &s;alts, that is, &s;alts to which &s;ulphur adheres, and the pigeons re|&s;ort from all parts to pick them up. In moi&s;t or rainy weather, the&s;e waters &s;end forth a &s;trong &s;mell at a di&s;tance, and before rain, they bubble up with an impetuous force; yet neither rain nor drought increa&s;es or de|crea&s;es the &s;prings.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="157">
From the large quantities of fine flower of brim&s;tone which the&s;e waters throw off, it is plain, that &s;ulphur is the principal thing in them; but experiment likewi&s;e proves, that be&s;ides &s;ulphur, the &s;tinking well has vitriol, nitre, copper, and &s;alt: The&s;e lie <HI>in &s;olutis principiis</HI> in earth from which the water comes, and may be &s;eparated by operation: &s;ome, I know, deny there is any copper in the&s;e waters; but they do not con&s;ider that the glittering glebes of a gold colour found here, can be nothing el&s;e than glebes gilt with copper.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;ea&s;es wherein this &s;trong <HI>&s;ul|phur-water</HI> is proper, it is good for every thing, except a con&s;umption. For this I recom|mend the <HI>Scarborough purging-chalybeate</HI> a|bove all waters. But if, reader, you have ob&s;tructions in your liver and other vi&s;cera, and are tormented with vicious humours in your inte&s;tines; if your bowels are full of worms, the a&s;carides, or the broad round worm, or the worms called the dog and the wolf, from their likene&s;s to the&s;e animals; or if, from a venereal cau&s;e, (the malady of many a prie&s;t and layman) you have an ulcer in the <HI>anus,</HI> or in the neck of your bladder, go to <HI>Har|rogate;</HI> drink the &s;tinking-water, live tem|perate, and you will be cured. For the &s;curvy, that univer&s;al di&s;ea&s;e, it is better than all other medicines. It is excellent in the
<PB N="141" REF="158">jaundice, though of many years &s;tanding. It cures the a&s;thma, the &s;cotomia, and pal|&s;y, and in many other deplorable ca&s;es gives wonderful relief. Whatever ails you, (the con&s;umption excepted) fly to <HI>Harrogate,</HI> and the water will do you good, if your hour be not come: and if you are well, the waters will promote long life, and make you the more able to dance with the ladies.</P>
<P>Four pints of water are enough for a pa|tient, to be taken from half an hour to two hours after &s;un -ri&s;ing, upon an empty &s;to|mach. You &s;hould take &s;ome preparatory medicine; and walk drinking the waters to warm the body a little, and make the pa&s;|&s;age the ea&s;ier. Some people I have known drink their do&s;e in bed, and it does well enough: but exerci&s;e and the thin open air do better, and contribute not a little to the patient's recovery: and there is no finer fre&s;her air in <HI>England</HI> than at this place.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the&s;e wells are the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ul|phur-water in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and, from the &s;uperior &s;trength of the impregnating &s;ulphur, it does not lo&s;e but retain the &s;ulphureous &s;mell, even when expo&s;ed to a &s;calding, and almo&s;t a violent heat; and, in di&s;tilling it, when three pints had been taken off from a gallon of it, the la&s;t was as &s;trong as the fir&s;t, and &s;tunk intolerably.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="159">
Make ha&s;te then to <HI>Harrogate,</HI> if you are &s;ick, and have money, and in all probabi|lity you will find the waters efficacious, un|le&s;s thy di&s;temper be a <HI>con&s;umption,</HI> or in its nature incurable, which is the ca&s;e of many, as death is the common fate of mankind.</P>

But when you are there, let me advi&s;e you to exerci&s;e as much as you can bear, without fatiguing your&s;elf,&mdash;and in the next place, to be regular in meats and drinks, and as temperate as po&s;&s;ible. Without the&s;e things, you will lo&s;e the benefit of the wa|ters.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some ob|&s;ervations on &s;paw-waters, and advice to the drink|ers in a mineral cour&s;e.</NOTE>I have known &s;ome worn-out hard drink|ers come to the <HI>Wells</HI> for relief, and at the &s;ame time increa&s;e by intemperance what they had contracted by the &s;ame mea&s;ure.

I have known &s;ome gentlemen, who &s;at up late, never exerci&s;ed, could not eat a dinner, and therefore would indulge in a fle&s;h &s;upper. &mdash; All the&s;e, and many other irregularities, have I known expect &s;urpri&s;ing effects from the waters, and when they received no benefit, &s;ay, there were no &s;anative principles in them. Unrea&s;onable, unhappy men! Be <HI>temperate: regular: exerci&s;e: keep the pa&s;&s;ions within bounds:</HI> and you may expect very a&s;toni&s;hing cures; provided your bodies are not become <HI>irreparable,</HI> and <HI>no longer tenantable:</HI> that your juices are not to the la&s;t degree glutinous and acrimonious: that the corro&s;ivene&s;s of your blood is not bringing on mortifications; &mdash;nor inflammations, filling, dilating, and breaking your ve&s;&s;els into &s;uppuration and putrefactions. Then, live how you will, the <HI>waters</HI> can be of no u&s;e. You mu&s;t pay the debt of nature by an incurable di&s;ea&s;e. Neither mineral waters, nor phy&s;ic, can cre|ate and enliven new bodies, or make and adapt particular members to the old. But if you are only hurt a little, and the di&s;ea&s;e is curable, the <HI>waters</HI> will certainly be <HI>effi|cacious,</HI> and recover you, if you u&s;e <HI>mode|rate

As to the company at the&s;e wells, I found it very good, and was plea&s;ed with the manner of living there. In the day-time we drank the waters, walked or rid about, and lived in &s;eparate parties; lodging in one
<PB N="145" REF="162">or other of the three inns that are on the edge of the common: but at night, the com|pany meet at one of the <HI>public-hou&s;es,</HI> (the <HI>inns</HI> having the benefit of the meeting in their turn), and &s;up together between eight and nine o'clock on the be&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial things, &s;uch as hot &s;houlders of mutton, rump-&s;takes, hot pigeon pies, veal-cutlets, and the like. For this &s;upper, ladies and gentlemen pay eight-pence each, and after &s;itting an hour, and drinking what wine, punch, and ale, every one chu&s;es, all who plea&s;e get up to country-dances, which generally la&s;t till one in the morning; tho&s;e that dance, and tho&s;e who do not, drinking as they will. The la|dies pay nothing for what liquor is brought in, either at &s;upper or after, and it co&s;ts the gentlemen five or &s;ix &s;hillings a man. At one the ladies withdraw, &s;ome to their hou&s;es in the neighbourhood, and &s;ome to their beds in the inns. The men who are temperate, do then likewi&s;e go to re&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, of all the wells I know, <HI>Har|rogate</HI> is in my opinion the mo&s;t charming. The waters are incomparable, no air can be better: and with the greate&s;t civility, chear|fulne&s;s, and good humour, there is a certain rural plainne&s;s and freedom mixed, which are va&s;tly plea&s;ing.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cha|racters of &s;ix <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> gentlemen. <HI>O'Keefe</HI>'s character.</NOTE>&sect;. 5. <HI>O'Keefe</HI> was as di&s;tingui&s;hed a cha|racter as I have ever known. He had read and thought, travelled and conver&s;ed, was a man of &s;en&s;e, and a &s;cholar. He had a great|ne&s;s of &s;oul, which &s;hewed a pre-eminence of dignity, and by conduct and behaviour, the faithful interpreters of the heart, always atte&s;ted the noble&s;t and mo&s;t generous &s;enti|ments. He had an extreme abhorrence of meanne&s;s of all kinds, treachery, revenge, envy, littlene&s;s of mind, and &s;hewed in all his actions the qualities that adorn a man.&mdash; His learning was of the genteel and u&s;eful kind; a &s;ort of agreeable knowledge, which he acquired rather from a &s;ound ta&s;te and good judgment than from the books he had read. He had a right e&s;timation of things, and had gathered up almo&s;t every thing that is amu&s;ing or in&s;tructive. This rendered
<PB N="148" REF="165">him a ma&s;ter in the art of plea&s;ing: and as he had added to the&s;e improvements the fa&s;hionable ornaments of life, languages and bodily exerci&s;es, he was the delight of all that knew him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Makins.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Makins</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the excellent qua|lities and perfections that are within the reach of human abilities. He had received from na|ture the happie&s;t talents, and he made &s;ingu|lar improvements of them by a &s;ucce&s;sful ap|plication to the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t orna|mental &s;tudies. Mu&s;ic, as before ob&s;erved, he excelled in. His intellectual faculties were fine, and, to his honour I can affirm, that he mo&s;tly employed them, as he did his great e&s;tate, to the good of mankind, the advancement of morality, and the &s;pread of <HI>pure thei&s;m,</HI> the wor&s;hip of God <HI>our Saviour,</HI> who rai&s;ed and &s;ent Chri&s;t to be a Redeemer. This gentleman was a zealous <HI>Unitarian,</HI> and, though but five and twenty, (when we met at <HI>Harrogate</HI>) a religious man: but his reli|gion was without any melancholy; nor had it any thing of that &s;everity of temper, which diffu&s;es too often into the hearts of the reli|gious a moro&s;e contempt of the world, and an antipathy to the plea&s;ures of it. He a|voided the a&s;&s;emblies of fools, knaves, and blockheads, but was fond of good company, and condemned that doctrine which taught men to retire from human &s;ociety to &s;eek
<PB N="149" REF="166">God in the horrors of &s;olitude. He thought the Almighty may be be&s;t found among men, where his goodne&s;s is mo&s;t active, and his providence mo&s;t employed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Galla&s;py.</HI></NOTE><HI>Galla&s;py</HI> was the talle&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t man I have ever &s;een, well made, and very hand|&s;ome. He had wit and abilities, &s;ung well, and talked with great &s;weetne&s;s and fluency, but was &s;o extremely wicked, that it were better for him, if he had been a natural fool. By his va&s;t &s;trength and activity, his riches and eloquence, few things could with&s;tand him. He was the mo&s;t prophane &s;wearer I have known: fought every thing, whored every thing, and drank &s;even in a hand; that is, &s;even gla&s;&s;es &s;o placed between the fingers of his right hand, that in drinking, the liquor fell into the next gla&s;&s;es, and thereby he drank out of the fir&s;t gla&s;s &s;even gla&s;&s;es at once. This was a common thing, I find from a book in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, in the madne&s;s that followed the re&s;toration of that profligate and worthle&s;s prince. But this gentleman was the only man I ever &s;aw who could or would attempt to do it; and he made but one gulp of whatever he drank; he did not &s;wallow a fluid like other people, but if it was a quart, poured it in as from pitcher to pitcher. When he &s;moaked tobacco, he always blew two pipes at once, one at each corner of his
<PB N="150" REF="167">mouth, and threw the &s;moak of both out of his no&s;trils. He had killed two men in duels before I left <HI>Ireland,</HI> and would have been hanged, but that it was his good fortune to be tried before a Judge, who never let any man &s;uffer for killing another in this manner. (This was the late Sir <HI>John St. Leger.</HI>) He de|bauched all the women he could, and many whom he could not corrupt, he ravi&s;hed. I went with him once in the &s;tage-coach to <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> and &s;eeing two pretty ladies pa&s;s by in their own chariot, he &s;wore in his horrible way, having drank very hard after dinner, that he would immediately &s;top them, and ravi&s;h them: nor was it without great diffi|culty that I hindered him from attempting the thing; by a&s;&s;uring him I would be their <HI>protector,</HI> and he mu&s;t pa&s;s through my heart before he could proceed to offer them the lea&s;t rudene&s;s. In &s;um, I never &s;aw his equal in impiety, e&s;pecially when inflamed with liquor, as he was every day of his life, though it was not in the power of wine to make him drunk, weak, or &s;en&s;ele&s;s. He &s;et no bounds or re|&s;trictions to mirth and revels. He only &s;lept every third night, and that often in his cloaths in a chair, where he would &s;weat &s;o prodigiou&s;ly as to be wet quite through; as wet as if come from a pond, or a pail of wa|ter had been thrown on him. While all the
<PB N="151" REF="168">world was at re&s;t, he was either drinking or dancing, &s;couring the bawdy-hou&s;es, or riding as hard as he could drive his hor&s;e on &s;ome iniquitous project. And yet, he never was &s;ick, nor did he ever receive any hurt or mi&s;|chief. In health, joy, and plenty, he pa&s;&s;ed life away, and died about a year ago at his hou&s;e in the county of <HI>Galway,</HI> without a pang or any kind of pain. This was <HI>Jack Galla&s;py.</HI> There are however &s;ome things to be &s;aid in his favour, and as he had more regard for me than any of his acquaintance, I &s;hould be un|grateful if I did not do him all the ju&s;tice in my power.</P>
<P>He was in the fir&s;t place far from being quarrel&s;ome, and if he fought a gentleman at the &s;mall-&s;word, or boxed with a porter or coachman, it was becau&s;e he had in &s;ome degree been ill u&s;ed, or fancied that the laws of honour required him to call an equal to an account, for a tran&s;action. His temper was naturally &s;weet.</P>
<P>In the next place, he was the mo&s;t gene|rous of mankind. His pur&s;e of gold was ever at his friend's &s;ervice: he was kind and good to his tenants: to the poor a very great benefactor. He would give more money away to the &s;ick and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in one year, than I believe many rich pious people do in &s;even. He had the ble&s;&s;ings of thou&s;ands,
<PB N="152" REF="169">for his charities, and, perhaps, this procured him the protection of heaven.</P>
<P>As to <HI>&s;wearing,</HI> he thought it was only criminal, when it was fal&s;e, or men lyed in their affirmations: and for <HI>whoring,</HI> he hoped there would be mercy, &s;ince men will be men while there are women. <HI>Ravi&s;hing</HI> he did not pretend to ju&s;tify, as the laws of his country were again&s;t it; but he could not think the woman was a &s;ufferer by it, as &s;he enjoyed without &s;inning the highe&s;t felicity. He intended her happine&s;s; and her &s;aying <HI>No,</HI> kept her an <HI>innocent.</HI></P>
<P>How far all this can excu&s;e Mr. <HI>Galla&s;py,</HI> I pretend not to determine: but as I thought it proper to give the world the picture of &s;o extraordinary a man, it was incumbent on me, as his friend, to &s;ay all I could, with truth, in his vindication.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Dunkley.</HI></NOTE><HI>Dunkley</HI> had an exten&s;ive capacity, an ex|qui&s;ite ta&s;te, and a fine genius. Be&s;ides an erudition which denominates what we call a man of learning, he happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;o|cial knowledge, which rendered him agree|able to every body. He was one of the men that are capable of touching every note. To all the variety of topics for conver&s;ation, the diver&s;ity of occurrences and incidents, the &s;everal di&s;tinctions of per&s;ons, he could adapt him&s;elf. He would laugh like <HI>Demo|critus:</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="170">weep like <HI>Heraclitus.</HI> He had the &s;hort, pert trip of the affected; the haughty, tragic &s;talk of the &s;olemn; and the free, gen|teel gait of the fine gentleman. He was qualified to plea&s;e all ta&s;tes, and capable of acting every part. He was grave, gay, a philo&s;opher, and a trifler. He had a time for all things, relative to &s;ociety, and his own true happine&s;s, but none for any thing repug|nant to honour and con&s;cience. He was a &s;urpri&s;ing and admirable man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Monaghan.</HI></NOTE><HI>Monaghan</HI> had genius and knowledge, had read many books, but knew more of man|kind. He laughed at the men who lo&s;t a|mong their books the elegancy of mind &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary in civil &s;ociety. He had no reli&s;h but for nice &s;tudies and fine literature, and de|&s;pi&s;ed too &s;erious and ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ciences. This was reckoned a fault in him by &s;everal judges: but with me it is a quere, if he was much to blame. Politene&s;s is certainly preferable to dry knowledge and thorny enquiries. This gentleman's was &s;uch as rendered him for ever agreeable and engaging. He was con|tinually an improving friend, and a gay com|panion. In the qualities of his &s;oul, he was generous without prodigality, humane with|out weakne&s;s, ju&s;t without &s;everity, and fond without folly. He was an hone&s;t and charm|ing fellow.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Gollogher.</HI></NOTE><HI>Gollogher</HI> was a man of learning and ex|traordinary abilities. He had read very hard for &s;everal years, and during that time, had collected and extracted from the be&s;t books more than any man I ever was acquainted with. He had four va&s;t volumes of common|place, royal paper, bound in rough calf, and had filled them with what is mo&s;t curious and beautiful in works of literature, mo&s;t re|fined in eloquent di&s;cour&s;es, mo&s;t poignant in books of critici&s;m, mo&s;t in&s;tructive in hi&s;|tory, mo&s;t touching and affecting in news, cata&s;trophes, and &s;tories; and with apho|ri&s;ms, &s;ayings, and epigrams. A prodigious memory made all this his own, and a great judgment enabled him to reduce every thing to the mo&s;t exact point of truth and accura|cy. A rare man! Till he was five and twenty, he continued this &s;tudious life, and but &s;eldom went into the mixed and fa&s;hion|able circles of the world. Then, all at once, he &s;old every book he had, and determined to read no more. He &s;pent his every day in the be&s;t company of every kind; and as he had the happy talent of manner, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="155" REF="172">that great power which &s;trikes and awa|kens fancy, by giving every &s;ubject the new dre&s;s and decoration it requires; &mdash; could make the mo&s;t common thing no longer tri|vial, when in his hand, and render a good thing mo&s;t exqui&s;itely plea&s;ing; &mdash; as he told a &s;tory beyond mo&s;t men, and had, in &s;hort, a univer&s;al means towards a univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s, it was but natural that he &s;hould be every where liked and wi&s;hed for. He charmed wherever he came. The &s;pecific I have men|tioned made every one fond of him. With the ladies e&s;pecially he was a great favourite, and more fortunate in his amours than any man I knew. Had he wanted the fine ta|lents he was ble&s;t with, yet his being an ex|tremely hand&s;ome man, and a ma&s;ter on the fiddle, could not but recommend him to the &s;ex. He might, if he had plea&s;ed, have married any one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and riche&s;t women in the kingdom. But he had an aver&s;ion to matrimony, and could not bear the thought of a wife. Love and a bottle were his ta&s;te. He was however the mo&s;t honourable of men in his amours, and ne|ver abandoned any woman to di&s;tre&s;s, as too many men of fortune do, when they have gratified de&s;ire. All the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed were ever &s;harers in Mr. <HI>Gollogher</HI>'s fine e&s;tate, and e&s;pecially the girls he had taken to his brea&s;t. He provided happily for them all, and left
<PB N="156" REF="173">nineteen daughters he had by &s;everal women a thou&s;and pounds each. This was acting with a temper worthy of a man; and to the memory of the <HI>benevolent Tom Gollogher</HI> I de|vote this memorandum.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid above, that too many men of fortune abandon the girls they have ruined, I will here relate a very remarkable &s;tory, in hopes it may make an impre&s;&s;ion on &s;ome rake of fortune, if &s;uch a man &s;hould ever take this book in his hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hi&s;to|ry of the unfortu|nate Mi&s;s <HI>Hunt.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 6. As I travelled once in the county of <HI>Kildare</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the &s;ummer-time, I came into a land of flowers and blo&s;&s;oms, hills, woods, and &s;hades: I &s;aw upon an eminence a hou&s;e, &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t agreeable images of rural beauties, and which appeared to be on purpo&s;e placed in that deco|rated &s;pot for retirement and contemplation. It is in &s;uch &s;ilent rece&s;&s;es of life, that we can be&s;t enjoy the <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>felicitous</HI> ideas, which more immediately concern the attention of man, and in the <HI>cool hours</HI> of reflection, &s;e|creted from the fancies and follies, the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the faction, and the plea&s;ures of an engaged world, thoroughly con&s;ider the wi&s;|dom and harmony of the works of nature, the important purpo&s;es of providence, and the various rea&s;ons we have to adore that ever glorious <HI>Being,</HI> who formed us for rational

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pic|ture of Mi&s;s <HI>Hunt.</HI></NOTE>The owner of this &s;weet place was Mr. <HI>Charles Hunt,</HI> a gentleman of a &s;mall e&s;tate and good &s;en&s;e, whom I knew many years before fortune led me to his hou&s;e. His wife was then dead, and he had but one child left, his daughter <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> The beauties of this young lady were very extraordinary. She had the fine&s;t eyes in the world, and &s;he looked, &s;he &s;miled, &s;he talked with &s;uch dif|fu&s;ive charms, as were &s;ufficient to fire the heart of the moro&s;e&s;t woman-hater that ever lived, and give his &s;oul a &s;oftne&s;s it never felt before. Her father took all po&s;&s;ible pains to educate her mind, and had the &s;ucce&s;s to render her under&s;tanding a wonder, when &s;he was but twenty years old. She &s;ung likewi&s;e beyond mo&s;t women, danced to per|fection, and had every accompli&s;hment of &s;oul and body that a man of the be&s;t ta&s;te could wi&s;h for in a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s. She was all beauty, life, and &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hunt</HI> thought to have had great hap|pine&s;s in this daughter, though it was not in his power to give her more than five hundred pounds for a fortune, and &s;he would have
<PB N="158" REF="175">been married to a country-gentleman in his neighbourhood of a good e&s;tate, had not death carried off both her father and lover in a few days, ju&s;t as the match was agreed on. This was a &s;ad misfortune, and opened a door to a long train of &s;orrows. For two years however after the decea&s;e of her father, &s;he lived very happily with an old lady, her near relation, and was univer&s;ally admired and re&s;pected. I &s;aw her many times du|ring that term, at the old lady's villa within a few miles of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and took great delight in her company. If I had not been then en|gaged to another, I would mo&s;t certainly have married her.</P>
<P>In this way I left <HI>Eliza</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and for &s;everal years could not hear what was become of her. No one could give me any information: but, about a twelvemonth ago, as I was walking in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> I &s;aw a wo|man who cleaned &s;hoes, and &s;eemed to be an object of great di&s;tre&s;s. She was in rags and dirt beyond all I had ever &s;een of the profe&s;&s;ion, and was truly &s;kin and bone. Her face was almo&s;t a &s;cull, and the only remaining expre&s;&s;ion to be &s;een was de&s;pair and angui&s;h. The object engaged my at|tention, not only on account of the uncom|mon mi&s;ery that was vi&s;ible; but, as her eyes, though &s;unk, were &s;till extraordinary, and there were &s;ome remains of beauty to be
<PB N="159" REF="176">traced. I thought I had &s;omewhere &s;een that face in better condition. This kept me look|ing at her, unnoticed, for near a quarter of an hour; and as I found &s;he turned her head from me, when &s;he &s;aw me, with a kind of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as if &s;he knew me, I then a&s;k|ed her name, and if &s;he had any where &s;een me before? &mdash; The tears immediately ran plentifully from her eyes, and when &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he &s;aid, I am <HI>Elizabeth Hunt.</HI> &mdash;What, Mr. <HI>Hunt</HI>'s daughter of <HI>Rafar|lin!</HI> I replied with amazement, and a concern that brought the tears into my eyes. I called a coach immediately, and took her to the hou&s;e of a good woman, who lodges and at|tends &s;ick people: ordered her clean cloaths, and gave the woman a charge to take the greate&s;t care of her, and let her want for no|thing proper, till I called next day.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw her again, &s;he was clean and whole, and &s;eemed to have recovered a little, though very little, of what &s;he once was: but a more mi&s;erable &s;pectacle my eyes have not often &s;een. She told me, that &s;oon after I went to <HI>England,</HI> Mr. <HI>R.</HI> a gentleman of my acquaintance of great fortune, got acquainted with her, courted her, and &s;wore in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, by the &s;upreme power, and the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, that he would be her hu&s;band, and marry her as &s;oon as a rich dy|ing uncle had breathed his la&s;t, if &s;he would
<PB N="160" REF="177">con&s;ent, in the mean while, to their living in &s;ecret as man and wife; for his uncle hated matrimony, and would not leave him his va&s;t fortune, if he heard he had a wife; and he was &s;ure, if he was married by any of the church, &s;ome whi&s;perer would find it out, and bring it to his ear. But notwith&s;tanding this plau&s;ible &s;tory, and that he acted the part of the fonde&s;t and tendere&s;t man that ever lived, yet, for &s;everal months, &s;he would not comply with his propo&s;al. She refu&s;ed to &s;ee him any more, and for &s;everal weeks he did not come in her &s;ight.</P>
<P>The fatal night however at la&s;t arrived, and from the Lord Mayor's ball, he prevail|ed on her, by repeated vows of &s;incerity and truth, to come with him to his lodgings. She was undone, with child, and at the end of two months, &s;he never &s;aw him more. When her relations &s;aw her big belly, they turned her out of doors; her friends and ac|quaintance would not look at her, and &s;he was &s;o de&s;pi&s;ed, and a&s;hamed to be &s;een, that &s;he went to <HI>England</HI> with her little one. It fortunately died on the road to <HI>London,</HI> and as her five hundred pounds were going fa&s;t by the time &s;he had been a year in the capi|tal, &s;he accepted an offer made her by a great man to go into keeping. Three years &s;he lived with him in &s;plendor, and when he died, &s;he was with &s;everal in high life, 'till
<PB N="161" REF="178">&s;he got a cancer in her brea&s;t; and after it was cut off, an incurable ab&s;ce&s;s appeared. This &s;truck her out of &s;ociety, and as &s;he grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day, what mo|ney &s;he had, and cloaths, were all gone in four years time, in the relief &s;he wanted and in &s;upport. She came the fifth year to a garret and rags, and at la&s;t, to clean &s;hoes, or peri&s;h for want. She then uncovered the upper part of her body, which was half eaten away, &s;o as to &s;ee into the trunk, and ren|dered her, in the emaciated condition &s;he was in, an object &s;hocking to behold. She lived in torment, and had no kind of ea&s;e or peace, but in reflecting, that her mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s might procure her the mercy of heaven here|after, and in conjunction with her true re|pentance bring her to re&s;t, when &s;he had pa&s;|&s;ed through the grave and gate of death.</P>

A decent and proper tribute of tears and &s;orrow, humanity requires; but when that duty has been payed, we mu&s;t remember, that to lament a dead woman is not to lament a wife. A wife mu&s;t be a living woman. The wife we lo&s;e by death is no more than a &s;ad and empty object, formed by the imagination, and to be &s;till devoted to her, is to be in love with an idea.

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Spence</HI>'s mentioning the memorable line from <HI>Virgil,</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed me not a little, as &s;he never gave the lea&s;t hint before, (though we had conver&s;ed then a fortnight) of her having any notion of the Latin tongue, and I looked at her with a rai&s;ed admiration, be|fore I replied in the following manner.&mdash; What you &s;ay, Mi&s;s <HI>Spence,</HI> is true.

If there be &s;omething &s;tronger than virtue in too many of them, &s;omething that ma&s;ters and &s;ubdues it; a pa&s;&s;ion, or pa&s;|&s;ions, rebellious and lawle&s;s, which makes
<PB N="169" REF="184">them neglect &s;ome, high relations, and take the throne from God and rea&s;on; gaming, drinking, keeping; yet there are very many exceptions, I am &s;ure. I know &s;everal, who have an <HI>equal affection</HI> to goodne&s;s, and were my acquaintance in the world larger than it is, I believe I could name a large number, who would not prefer indulgence to virtue, or re&s;ign her for any con&s;ideration. There are men, madam, and young men, who allow a partial regard to rectitude is incon|&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd, and are &s;en&s;ible, it is not certain, that there is ab&s;olutely nothing <HI>at all</HI> in the evidences of religion: that if there was but even a chance for obtaining ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>ine&s;timable worth,</HI> yet a chance for <HI>eternal</HI> bli&s;s is worth &s;ecuring, by acting as the &s;pot|le&s;s holine&s;s of the Deity requires from us, and the rea&s;on and fitne&s;s of things makes nece&s;&s;ary, in re&s;pect of every kind of relation and neighbour.

<P>On the other hand, I would a&s;k, if there are no unhappy marriages by the faults of women?

Have you heard of no unhappy marriages by the pa&s;&s;ions and vices of women, as well as by the faults of men? I am afraid there are too many wives as &s;ubject to ill habits as the men can be. It is po&s;&s;ible to name not a few la|dies who find their virtuous exerci&s;es, the duties of piety, and the various offices of love and goodne&s;s, as di&s;ta&s;teful and irk&s;ome to them as they can be to a libertine or a cruel man. I could tell &s;ome &s;ad &s;tories to this purpo&s;e: but all I &s;hall &s;ay more is, that there are faults on both &s;ides, and that it is not only the ladies run a hazard of being ruined by marrying. I am &s;ure, there are as many men of fortune mi&s;erable by the manners and conduct of their wives, as you can name la|dies who are &s;ufferers by the temper and prac|tice of their hu&s;bands. This is the truth of the ca&s;e, and the bu&s;ine&s;s is, in order to avoid the mi&s;eries we both have &s;een among mar|ried people, to re&s;olve to act well and wi&s;ely.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 19, 1731. A de&s;crip|tion of a beautiful &s;pot of ground, and a &s;weet pretty country &s;eat in the we&s;t-rid|ing of <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 1. WHILE I was thinking in this manner of the &s;un, and the author of it, I came into a &s;ilent unfrequent|ed glade, that was finely adorned with &s;treams and trees. Nature there &s;eemed to be lulled into a kind of plea&s;ing repo&s;e, and con&s;pired as it were to &s;often a &s;peculative genius into &s;olid and awful contemplations. The woods, the meadows, and the water, formed the mo&s;t delightful &s;cenes, and the charms of di&s;tant pro&s;pects multiplied as I travelled on: but at la&s;t I came to a &s;eat which had all the
<PB N="181" REF="196">beauties that proportion, regularity, and con|venience, can give a thing. The pretty man|&s;ion was &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of meadows, and &s;urrounded with gardens, trees, and va|rious &s;hades. A fountain played to a great height before the door, and fell into a circu|lar re&s;ervoir of water, that had foreign wild|fowl &s;wimming on its &s;urface. The whole was very fine.</P>
<P>Here I walked for &s;ome time, and after roaming about, went up to the hou&s;e, to ad|mire the beauties of the thing. I found the windows open, and could &s;ee &s;everal ladies in one of the apartments. How to gain ad|mittance was the que&s;tion, and I began to con|trive many ways; but while I was bu&s;ied in this kind of &s;peculation, a genteel footman came up to me, and let me know, his lady &s;ent him to inform me I might walk in and look at the hou&s;e, if I plea&s;ed. So in I went, and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal grand rooms all finely fur|ni&s;hed, and filled with paintings of great price. In one of tho&s;e chambers the &s;ervant left me, and told me, he would wait upon me again in a little time. This &s;urprized me, and my a&s;toni&s;hment was doubled, when I had re|mained alone for almo&s;t an hour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac|count of two won|derful fi|gures, which played on the <HI>German</HI> flute.</NOTE> No foot|man returned: nor culd I hear the &s;ound of any feet. But I was charmingly enter|tained all the while. In the apartment I was left in, were two figures, dre&s;&s;ed like a
<PB N="182" REF="197">&s;hepherd and &s;hepherde&s;s, which amazed me very much. They &s;at on a rich couch, in a gay alcove, and both played on the <HI>German</HI> flute. They moved their heads, their arms, their eyes, their fingers, and &s;eemed to look with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at each other, while they breathed, at my entring the room, that fine piece of mu&s;ic, the ma&s;querade minuet; and afterwards, &s;everal excellent pieces. I thought at fir&s;t, they were living creatures; but on examination, finding they were only wood, my admiration increa&s;ed, and be|came exceeding great, when I &s;aw, by &s;hut|ting their mouths, and &s;topping their fingers, that the mu&s;ic did not proceed from an organ within the figures. It was an extraordi|nary piece of clock-work, invented and made by one <HI>John Nixon,</HI> a poor man.</P>

At length however, a door was opened, and a lady entred, who was va&s;tly pretty, and richly dre&s;t beyond what I had ever &s;een. She had diamonds enough for a queen. I was amazed at the &s;ight of her, and wondered &s;till more, when, after being honoured with a low courte&s;y, on my bowing to her, &s;he a&s;ked me in <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> how I did, and how long I had been in <HI>England.</HI> My &s;urprize was &s;o great I could not &s;peak, and upon this, &s;he &s;aid, in the &s;ame language, I &s;ee, Sir, you have no remembrance of me.
<PB N="183" REF="198">You cannot recollect the lea&s;t idea of me. You have quite forgot young <HI>Imoinda,</HI> of the county of <HI>Gallway</HI> in <HI>Ireland;</HI> who was your partner in country dances, when you pa&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tmas of the year 1715, at her fa|ther's hou&s;e. What (I &s;aid) Mi&s;s <HI>Wolf</HI> of <HI>Baline&s;kay? O my Imoinda!</HI> And &s;natching her to my arms, I almo&s;t &s;tifled her with ki&s;&s;es. I was &s;o glad to &s;ee her again, and in the &s;ituation &s;he appeared in, that I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my joys in that tumultu|ous manner, and hoped &s;he would excu&s;e her <HI>Valentine,</HI> as I then remembred I had had that honour when we were both very young.</P>
<P>This lady, who was good humour it&s;elf in fle&s;h and blood, was &s;o far from being an|gry at this &s;trange flight of mine, that &s;he only laughed exce&s;&s;ively at the oddne&s;s of the thing; but &s;ome ladies who came into the apartment with her &s;eemed frightened, and at a lo&s;s what to think, 'till &s;he cleared up the affair to them, by letting them know who I was, and how near her father and mine lived to each other in the country of <HI>Ireland.</HI> She was indeed extremely glad to &s;ee me, and from her heart bid me welcome to <HI>Clankford.</HI> Our meeting was a va&s;t &s;urprize to both of us. She thought I had been in the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> fields, as &s;he had heard nothing of me for &s;everal years: and I little imagined, I &s;hould ever find her in
<PB N="184" REF="199"><HI>England,</HI> in the rich condition &s;he was in. She a&s;ked me by what de&s;tiny I was brought to <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> and in return for my &s;hort &s;tory, gave me an account of her&s;elf at large. Till the bell rung for dinner, we &s;at talking toge|ther, and then went down to as elegant a one as I had ever &s;een. There were twelve at table, &s;ix young ladies, all very hand&s;ome, and &s;ix gentlemen. Good humour pre&s;ided, and in a rational delightful chearfulne&s;s, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours away. After coffee, we went to cards, and from them to country dances, as two of the footmen played well on the fiddle. The charming <HI>Imoinda</HI> was my partner, and as they all did the dances extremely well, we were as happy a little &s;et as ever footed it to country mea&s;ure. Two weeks I pa&s;&s;ed in this fine felicity. Then we all &s;eparated, and went different ways. What became of Mi&s;s <HI>Wolf</HI> after this &mdash; the extraordinary events of her life &mdash; and the &s;tories of the five ladies with her, &mdash; I &s;hall relate in the &s;econd volume of my <HI>Memoirs of &s;everal Ladies of Great Britain.</HI> Four of them were Mrs. <HI>Che&s;lin,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Fan&s;haw,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Chadley,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Bi&s;&s;el;</HI> the fifth was Mi&s;s <HI>Farmor;</HI> all mentioned in the Preface to the fir&s;t volume of my Memoirs afore&s;aid.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 25, 1731.

<P>&sect;. 3. A fortnight, as &s;aid, I &s;tayed with Mi&s;s <HI>Wolf,</HI> that was; but, at the time I am
<PB N="185" REF="200">&s;peaking of, the relict of Sir <HI>Loghlin Fitz|gibbons,</HI> an old <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> knight, who was im|men&s;ely rich, and married her when he was creeping upon all-fours, with &s;now on his head, and fro&s;t in his bones, that he might lie by a naked beauty, and gaze at that awful &s;pot he had no power to enjoy. I did intend, on leaving this lady, to be at <HI>Knare&s;borough</HI> at night; but the fates, for a while, took me another way. At the inn where I dined, I became acquainted with a gen|tleman much of my own age, who was an ingenious agreeable man. This was <HI>Oli|ver Wincup,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had lately married Mi&s;s <HI>Horner</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> a fine young creature, and a great fortune. This gentle|man, by his good humour, and &s;everal good &s;ongs, plea&s;ed me &s;o much, that I drank more than I intended, and was ea&s;ily pre|vailed on to go with him, in the evening, to <HI>Woodce&s;ter,</HI> the name of his &s;eat; which was but ten miles from the hou&s;e we had dined at. We came in ju&s;t as they were going to tea. There was a great deal of company, at lea&s;t a dozen ladies, be&s;ides half a &s;core gen|tlemen, and all of them as gay and engaging as the be&s;t-bred young mortals could be.</P>

<PB N="186" REF="201">of &s;everal ground rooms, (ten I think) de|tached from one another, and &s;eparated by trees and banks of flowers. They were in|tirely of wood, but finely put together, and all di&s;po&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ymmetry and beauty. They were very hand&s;ome without &s;ide, and the in&s;ide furni&s;hed and adorned with the fine&s;t things the owner could get for money. Ea&s;y hills, little vallies, and pretty groves, &s;urrounded the &s;weet retreat, and the vallies were watered with clear &s;treams. The whole had a fine appearance. The varied &s;cenes for ever plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of liv|ing at <HI>Woodce&s;ter.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 5. At this delightful place I &s;tayed ten days, and was very happy indeed. We drank, we laughed, we danced, we &s;ung, and chatted; and when that was done, 'twas night. But country dances were the chief diver&s;ion; and I had a partner, who was not only a wonder in face and per|&s;on, (divinely pretty) but did wonders in every motion. This was Mi&s;s <HI>Vey&s;&s;iere</HI> of <HI>Cumberland:</HI> the dear creature! Reader, when I was a young fellow, there were few could equal me in dancing. The famous <HI>Paddy Murphy,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> member of the hou&s;e of commons, commonly called the <HI>Little Beau,</HI> well known at <HI>Lucas</HI>'s coffee-hou&s;e, <HI>Dublin:</HI> (He danced one night, in 1734, that I was at the ca&s;tle, before the late Duke of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="202">and his Duche&s;s, at their grace's reque&s;t:) this gentleman, and <HI>Langham,</HI> the miller, who danced every night at the renowned <HI>Stretch</HI>'s puppet-&s;hew, before the curtain was drawn up, were both de&s;ervedly admired for their performance in the hornpipe; yet were nothing to me in this particular: but Mi&s;s <HI>Vey&s;&s;iere</HI> out-did me far: her &s;teps were in|finite, and &s;he did them with that amazing agility, that &s;he &s;eemed like a dancing angel in the air. Eight nights we footed it together, and all the company &s;aid, we were born for each other. She did charm me, and I &s;hould have a&s;ked her the que&s;tion, to try her tem|per, if <HI>Wincup</HI> had not told me, her father intended to &s;acrifice her to a man old enough to be her grandfather, for the &s;ake of a great jointure; and in a week or two &s;he was to dance the <HI>reel of Bogee</HI> with an <HI>old monk.</HI>&mdash; Poor Mi&s;s <HI>Vey&s;&s;iere!</HI> I &s;aid; What con|nexion can there be between the <HI>hoary churl</HI> and you,</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac|count of a company of &s;troling players at <HI>Woodce&s;ter.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 6. Another of our diver&s;ions at <HI>Wood|ce&s;ter,</HI> was a little company of &s;ingers and dancers Mr. <HI>Wincup</HI> had hired, to perform
<PB N="188" REF="203">in a &s;ylvan theatre he had in his gardens. The&s;e people did the <HI>mime,</HI> the <HI>dance,</HI> the <HI>&s;ong,</HI> extremely well. There was among them one Mi&s;s <HI>Hinxworth,</HI> a charming young creature, who excelled in every thing; but in &s;inging e&s;pecially, had no equal I believe in the world. She was a gentleman's daugh|ter, and had been carried off by one <HI>O Regan,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> and dancing-ma&s;ter, the head of this company. He was the mo&s;t active fellow upon earth, and the be&s;t harlequin I have ever &s;een. Every evening we had &s;ome|thing or other extraordinary from the&s;e per|formers. He gave us two pieces which &s;o nearly re&s;embled the two favourite entertain|ments called <HI>Harlequin Sorcerer,</HI> and the <HI>Genii,</HI> (tho' in &s;everal particulars better) that I cannot help thinking Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> owed his <HI>Har|lequin Sorcerer</HI> to <HI>O Regan:</HI> and that the <HI>Ge|nii</HI> of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> was the invention of this <HI>Iri&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>You know, reader, that in the fir&s;t &s;cene of <HI>Harlequin Sorcerer,</HI> there is a group of witches at their orgies in a wilderne&s;s by moon-light, and that harlequin comes riding in the air between two witches, upon a long pole: Here <HI>O Regan</HI> did what was never at|tempted at <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> hou&s;e, and what no other man in the world I believe did ever do. As the witches danced round and round, hand in hand, as &s;wift as they could move,
<PB N="189" REF="204"><HI>O Regan</HI> leaped upon the &s;houlder of one of them, and for near a quarter of an hour, jumped the contrary way as fa&s;t as they went, round all their &s;houlders. This was a fine piece of activity. I think it much more wonderful, than to keep at the top of the outwheel of a water-mill, by jumping there, as it goes with the greate&s;t rapidity round. This <HI>Mun. Hawley,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac|count of Mr. <HI>Haw|ley</HI> of <HI>Loch-Gur.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Loch-Gur</HI> in the county of <HI>Tipperary,</HI> could do. He was a charming fellow in body and mind, and fell unfortu|nately in the 22d year of his age. In a plain field, by a trip of his hor&s;e, he came down, and fractured his &s;kull. He did not think he was hurt: but at night as &s;oon as he be|gan to eat, it came up. A &s;urgeon was &s;ent for to look at his head. It was cracked in &s;everal places, and he died the next day. He and I were near friends.</P>

The fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> 1731, at five in the morning, I took my leave of hone&s;t <HI>Wincup,</HI> as chearful and worthy a fellow as ever lived, and &s;et out for <HI>Knare&s;borough;</HI> but lo&s;t my way, went quite wrong, and in three hours time, came to a little blind ale|hou&s;e, the &s;ign of the Cat and Bagpipe, in a lone &s;ilent place. The ma&s;ter of this &s;mall inn was one <HI>Tom Clancy,</HI> brother to the well-known <HI>Martin Clancy</HI> in <HI>Dublin.</HI> He
<PB N="190" REF="205">came to <HI>England</HI> to try his fortune, as he told me, and married an old woman, who kept this public-hou&s;e, the &s;ign of the Cat, to which <HI>Tom</HI> added the Bagpipe. As he had been a waiter at his brother's hou&s;e, he re|membred to have &s;een me often there, and was rejoiced at my arrival at the Cat and Bagpipe. He got me a good &s;upper of trouts, fine ale, and a &s;quib of punch, and after he had done talking of all the gallant fellows that u&s;ed to re&s;ort to his brother <HI>Martin</HI>'s, &s;uch as the heroes of Trinity-college, <HI>Dublin,</HI> Captain <HI>Maccan</HI> of the county of <HI>Kerry,</HI> and many more, he let me go to &s;leep.</P>

I &s;auntered on for about an hour ea&s;ily enough, but at la&s;t came to a part of the fore&s;t that was almo&s;t impenetra|ble. Curio&s;ity incited me to &s;truggle on|wards, if po&s;&s;ible, that I might &s;ee what country was before me, or if any hou&s;e was to be found in this gloomy place: this co&s;t me a couple of hours, much toil, and many &s;cratches; but at length, I arrived at the edge of a barren moor, and beyond it, about a quarter of a mile off, &s;aw another wood. Proud to be daring, on I went, and &s;oon came to the wood in view, which I found
<PB N="191" REF="206">cut into walks, and arrived at a circular &s;pace &s;urrounded with a fore&s;t, that was above a hun|dred yards every way. In the center of this was a hou&s;e, enclo&s;ed within a very broad deep mote, full of water, and the banks on the in&s;ide, all round, were &s;o thick planted with trees, that there was no &s;eeing any thing of the man&s;ion but the roof and the chim|nies. Over the water was one narrow draw|bridge, lifted up, and a &s;trong door on the garden &s;ide of the mote. Round I walked &s;everal times, but no &s;oul could I &s;ee: not the lea&s;t noi&s;e could I hear; nor was there a cottage any where in view. I wondered much at the whole; and if I had had my lad <HI>O Finn</HI> with me, and my pole, I would mo&s;t certainly have attempted to leap the fo&s;s, broad as it was, and if it was po&s;&s;ible, have known who were the occupants of this &s;trange place. But as nothing could be done, nor any information be had, I returned again to the Cat and Bagpipe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Cock,</HI> an old lawyer.</NOTE>It was ten by the time I got back, and at breakfa&s;t I told <HI>Clancy,</HI> my landlord, where I had been, and a&s;ked him if he knew who lived in that wonderful place. His name (he replied) is <HI>Cock,</HI> an old lawyer and limb of the devil, and the mo&s;t hideous man to behold that is upon the face of the earth. Every thing that is bad and &s;hocking is in his
<PB N="192" REF="207">compound: he is to outward appearance a mon&s;ter: and within, the mi&s;er, the oppre&s;|&s;or, the villain. He is de&s;pi&s;ed and abhorred, but &s;o immen&s;ely rich, that he can do any thing, and no one is able to contend with him. I could relate, &s;ays <HI>Tom,</HI> a thou&s;and in&s;tances of his inju&s;tice and cruelty; but one alone is &s;ufficient to render his memory for ever cur&s;ed. Two gentlemen of fortune, who had employed him &s;everal years in their af|fairs, and had a good opinion of him, on account of a canted uprightne&s;s and &s;eeming piety, left him &s;ole guardian of a daughter each of them had, and the management of fifty thou&s;and pounds a-piece, the fortune of the&s;e girls, with power to do as he plea&s;ed, without being &s;ubject to any controul, 'till they are of age. The&s;e ladies, as fine crea|tures as ever the eye of man beheld, he has had now a year in confinement in that pri&s;on you &s;aw in the wood; and while he lives, will keep them there to be &s;ure, on account of the hundred thou&s;and pounds, or till he di&s;po&s;e of them to his own advantage, &s;ome way or other. He intends them, it is &s;aid, for two ugly nephews he has, who are now at &s;chool, about fourteen years old, and for this purpo&s;e, or &s;ome other as bad, never &s;uf|fers them to &s;tir out of the garden &s;urrounded by the mote, nor lets any human creature vi|&s;it
<PB N="193" REF="208">them. They are greatly to be pitied, but bear the &s;evere u&s;age wonderfully well. One of them, Mi&s;s <HI>Martha Til&s;ton,</HI> is in her twen|tieth year; and the other, Mi&s;s <HI>Alithea Llan|&s;oy,</HI> in her nineteenth. They are girls of great &s;en&s;e, and would, if any kind of oppor|tunity offered, make a brave attempt to e&s;cape: but that &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible. They are not only &s;o &s;trictly confined, and he for ever at home with them, except he rides a few miles; but are attended continually in the garden, when they walk, by a &s;ervant who is well paid, and devoted to the old man her ma&s;ter. This makes them think their &s;tate is fixed for life, and to get rid of melancholy, they read, and practice mu&s;ic. They both play on the fiddle, and do it ex|tremely fine.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Clancy</HI> had done, and I was much more &s;urprized at his relation than at the place of their re&s;idence which I had &s;een. I became very thoughtful, and continued for &s;ome time with my eyes fixed on the table, while I revolved the ca&s;e of the&s;e unfor|tunate young ladies. But is all this true? (at la&s;t I &s;aid): Or only report? How did you get &s;uch particular information?&mdash;I will tell you, <HI>Tom</HI> an&s;wered. Old <HI>Cock</HI> is my land|lord, and bu&s;ine&s;s often brings me to his hou&s;e in the wood, to pay my rent, or a&s;k
<PB N="194" REF="209">for &s;omething I want. Be&s;ides, I &s;ometimes bring a fat pig there, and other things to fell. My daughter likewi&s;e has &s;ometimes a piece of work in hand for the ladies, and &s;he and I take a walk with it there by a better and &s;horter way than you went. You cannot think how glad they are to &s;ee us, and they let me into all their perplexities and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>On hearing this, a &s;udden thought of be|ing &s;erviceable to the&s;e ladies came into my head, and I was going to a&s;k a que&s;tion in rela|tion to it, when two hor&s;emen rode up to the door, and one of them called <HI>Hou&s;e!</HI> This, &s;ays my landlord, is old <HI>Cock</HI> and his man; and immediately went out to him, to know his will. He told him, he came for the ride-&s;ake him|&s;elf, to &s;ee if any letters were left for him by that day's po&s;t at his hou&s;e, and would dine with him if he had any thing to eat. That I have, (the man replied), as fine a fowl, bacon and greens, as ever was &s;erved up to any table, and only one gentleman, a &s;tranger and tra|veller, to &s;it down to it. <HI>Cock</HI> upon this came into the room I was &s;itting in, and after look|ing very earne&s;tly at me, &s;aid, Your &s;ervant, Sir. I told him I was his mo&s;t humble, and right glad to meet with a gentleman for &s;ociety in that lone place. I immediately began a &s;tory of a cock and a bull, and made the old fellow grin now and then. I in|formed
<PB N="195" REF="210">him among other things, that I was travelling to <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> to look after &s;ome e&s;tates I had there, but mu&s;t hurry back to <HI>London</HI> very &s;oon, for my wife was within a few weeks of her time. You are a mar|ried man then, Sir, he replied. Yes, in|deed, and &s;o &s;upremely ble&s;t with the charms and perfections, the fondne&s;s and obedience of a wife, that I would not be unmarried for all the world: few men living &s;o happy as I am in the nuptial &s;tate.&mdash;Here dinner was brought in, and to &s;ave the old gentle|man trouble, I would cut up the fowl. I helped him plentifully to a &s;lice of the brea&s;t, and the tips of the wings, and picked out for him the tendere&s;t greens. I was as com|plai&s;ant as it was po&s;&s;ible, and drank his health many times. The bottle after dinner I put about pretty quick, and told my old gentleman, if affairs ever brought him up to <HI>London,</HI> I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him at my hou&s;e in <HI>Golden-Square,</HI> the very next door to Sir <HI>John Heir</HI>'s; or, if I could be of any &s;ervice to him there, he would oblige me very much by letting me know in what way. In &s;hort, I &s;o buttered him with words, and filled him with fowl and wine, that he &s;eem|ed well plea&s;ed, e&s;pecially when he found there was nothing to pay, as I informed him it was my own dinner I had be&s;poke, and
<PB N="196" REF="211">dined with double plea&s;ure in having the &s;a|tisfaction of his mo&s;t agreeable company. He was a fine politician, I &s;aid, and talked extremely well of the government and the times: that I had received more true know|ledge from his ju&s;t notions, than from all I had read of men and things, or from con|ver&s;ing with any one. The gla&s;s during this time was not long &s;till, but in &s;uch toa&s;ts as I found were grateful to his Jacobite heart, drank brimmers as fa&s;t as opportunity &s;erved, and he pledged me and cottoned in a very diverting way. He grew very fond of me at la&s;t, and hoped I would &s;pare &s;o much time, as to come and dine with him the next day. This honour I a&s;&s;ured him I would do my&s;elf, and punctually be with him at his hour. He then rid off, brim full, and I walked out to con&s;ider of this affair. But before I proceed any farther in my &s;tory, I mu&s;t give a de&s;cription of this man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;crip|tion of old <HI>Cock</HI> the lawyer.</NOTE><HI>Cock,</HI> the old lawyer and guardian, was a low man, about four feet eight inches, very broad, and near &s;eventy years old. He was humped behind to an enormous degree, and his belly as a va&s;t fla&s;ket of garbage projected mon&s;trou&s;ly before. He had the mo&s;t hang|ing look I have ever &s;een. His brows were prodigious, and frowning in a &s;hocking man|ner; his eyes very little, and above an inch
<PB N="197" REF="212">within his head; his no&s;e hooked like a buz|zard, wide no&s;trils like a hor&s;e, and his mouth &s;parrow. In this ca&s;e, was a mind quite cunning, in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, a|cute, artful, de&s;igning and ba&s;e. There was not a &s;park of honour or genero&s;ity in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>How to circumvent this able one, and de|liver the two beauties from his oppre&s;&s;ive power, was the que&s;tion: it &s;eemed almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible; but I re&s;olved to do my be&s;t. This I told <HI>Clancy,</HI> and reque&s;ted, as I was to dine with <HI>Cock</HI> the next day, that he would be there in the morning, on &s;ome pretence or other, and let the ladies know, I offered them my &s;ervice, without any other view than to do them good; and if they accepted it, to inform me by a note, &s;lipt into my hand when they &s;aw me, that if they could direct me what to do, I would execute it at any hazard, or let them hint the lea&s;t par|ticular that might have any tendency to their freedom in &s;ome time to come, though it were three months off, and I would wait for the moment, and &s;tudy to improve the &s;cheme. This my landlord very carefully acquainted them with, at the time I men|tioned; and by two o'clock I was at <HI>Cock</HI>'s hou&s;e, to &s;ee the&s;e beauties, and know what they thought of the &s;ervice offered them.
<PB N="198" REF="213">The old man received me much civiler than I thought he would do when he was &s;ober, and had, what my landlord told me was a very rare thing in his hou&s;e, to wit, a good dinner that day. Ju&s;t as it was brought in, the ladies entred, (two charming creatures indeed), and made me very low courte&s;ies, while their eyes declared the &s;en&s;e they had of the good I intended them. <HI>Cock</HI> &s;aid, the&s;e are my nieces, Sir, and as &s;oon as I had &s;a|luted them, we &s;at down to table. The elde&s;t carved, and helped me to the be&s;t the board afforded, and young as they were, they both &s;hewed by their manner, and the little they &s;aid, that they were women of &s;en&s;e and breeding. They retired, a few minutes after dinner, and the younge&s;t con|trived, in going off, to give me a billet in an invi&s;ible manner. I then turned to <HI>Cock</HI> intirely, heard him abu&s;e the government in non&s;en&s;e and fal&s;hoods, as all <HI>Jacobites</HI> do; and after we had drank and talked for better than an hour, took my leave of him very willingly, to read the following note.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>What to do then I could not tell; but as I rid back I con&s;ulted with my lad O <HI>Fin,</HI> who was a very extraordinary young man, and a&s;ked him what ob&s;ervations he had made on the &s;ervants and place. He &s;aid, he had tried the depth of the water in the mote all round, and found it fordable at one angle, wai&s;t high, and about two feet broad the rock he trod on. He had &s;tripped, and walked it over to be &s;ure of the thing. As to the people, he fancied there was one young man, a labourer by the year under the gar|dener, who would, for a rea&s;onable reward for lo&s;ing his place, be aiding in the e&s;cape of the ladies; for he talked with pity of them, and with great &s;everity of his ma&s;ter: that
<PB N="200" REF="215">if I plea&s;ed, he would &s;ound this man, and let me know more in relation to him: that if he would be concerned, he could very ea|&s;ily carry the ladies on his back acro&s;s the water, as he was a tall man, and then we might take them behind us to what place we plea&s;ed: or, if it was not &s;afe tru&s;ting this man, for fear of his telling his ma&s;ter, in hopes of more money on that &s;ide, then, he would him&s;elf engage to bring the ladies and their cloaths over, on his own back, with wetting only their legs, if they could be at the water-&s;ide &s;ome hour in the night. This was not bad to be &s;ure; but I was afraid to tru&s;t the man; for, if he &s;hould inform old <HI>Cock</HI> of the thing, they would be confined to their chambers, and made clo&s;e pri&s;oners for the time to come. It was better therefore to rely entirely upon <HI>O Fin,</HI> if they could get into the garden in the night.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer then to another letter I had from the ladies by my landlord's daughter the next morning, in which they lamented the ap|pearing impo&s;&s;ibility of an e&s;cape, I let them know immediately the &s;tate of the water, and de&s;ired to be informed what they thought of the gardener's man; or, if he would not do, could they at any particular hour, get to that angle of the mote I named, to be brought over on my man's back, and then immedi|ately ride off behind us on pillions, which
<PB N="201" REF="216">&s;hould be prepared.mdash;Their an&s;wer was, that they dared not tru&s;t any of Mr. <HI>Cock</HI>'s men, but thought my own &s;ervant would do, and the &s;cheme rea&s;onable and &s;eemingly &s;afe, if they could get out. They gave me a million of thanks for my amazing care of them, and called the immortal powers to witne&s;s the high &s;en&s;e they had of their unutterable obli|gation to me.</P>
<P>Waiting then for them, I &s;taid at the little inn three days longer, and at la&s;t received a billet to let me know, that at twelve o'clock that night, which was the &s;ixth of <HI>June,</HI> they could, by an accident that had happened, be at the appointed place, and ready to go where|ever I plea&s;ed. To a minute my man and I were there, and in a few moments, <HI>O Fin</HI> brought them and their cloaths over &s;afe. In an in&s;tant after they were behind us, and we rid away as fa&s;t as we could. Six hours we travelled without &s;topping, and in that time, had gone about thirty miles. We breakfa&s;ted very gaily at our inn, and when the hor&s;es had re&s;ted a couple of hours, we &s;et out again, and rid till three in the after|noon, when we baited at a lone hou&s;e in a valley, called <HI>Straveret Vale,</HI> which had every rural charm that can be found in the fine&s;t part of <HI>Juan Fernandes.</HI> A young couple, va&s;tly civil, kept here a &s;mall clean public hou&s;e, the &s;ign of the pilgrim, on the very
<PB N="202" REF="217">margin of a pretty river, and the plain things they had were as good as we could de&s;ire. Their bread, their drink, their fowl, their eggs, their butter, chee&s;e, vegetables, and bacon, were excellent, and as they had good beds, I thought we could not do better than lie by for two or three days in this &s;weet place, 'till it was determined, where the la|dies &s;hould fix. We were at lea&s;t fixty miles from old <HI>Cock</HI>'s hou&s;e, and in an ob&s;curity that would conceal us from any pur&s;uers; for we had kept the cro&s;s roads and by-ways, and were on the confines of <HI>We&s;tmoreland.</HI> Here then we agreed to re&s;t for a little time. In reality, it was ju&s;t as I plea&s;ed. The la|dies were all acknowledgment for what I did to deliver them, and all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to my di|rection. They had each of them thirty gui|neas in their pur&s;es, as they &s;hewed me, but what to do after that was gone, or where to go while it la&s;ted, to be in &s;afety, they could not tell.</P>
<P>The affair perplexed me very much, and I turned it a thou&s;and ways, without being able to &s;ettle it as I would. I had two young heire&s;&s;es on my hands, who wanted more than a year of being at age, and I mu&s;t &s;up|port them, and place them in &s;ome &s;pot of decency, &s;ecurity, and peace, &s;ince I had gone thus far, or I had injured them greatly, in&s;tead of &s;erving them, in bringing them
<PB N="203" REF="218">from their guardian's hou&s;e. This took up all my thoughts for three days. I concealed however my unea&s;ine&s;s from them, and en|deavoured to make the hou&s;e and place quite plea&s;ing to them. I kept up a chearfulne&s;s and gaiety, and we &s;at down with joy and plea&s;ure to breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper. Within doors, we played at cards, we &s;ung, and I entertained them with my <HI>German</HI>-flute. Abroad, we walked, fi&s;hed, and &s;ome|times I rowed them up the river in a boat the man of the hou&s;e had. The whole &s;cheme was really delightful, and as the girls had great quickne&s;s and vivacity, and were far from being ignorant, con&s;idering their few years, I could have wi&s;hed it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;tay there much longer: but it was no place for them, and I was obliged to call at <HI>Clay|tor,</HI> in a little time. I could not forget my promi&s;e to the lovely Mi&s;s <HI>Spence.</HI> My ho|nour was engaged, and there was no time to lo&s;e. It is true, if I had not been en|gaged, I might immediately have married either the beautiful Mi&s;s <HI>Til&s;ton,</HI> or the more beautiful Mi&s;s <HI>Lland&s;oy,</HI> then become my wards; but as they were minors, if &s;uch a wife died under age, I could be no gainer, and might have children to maintain with|out any fortune. All the&s;e things &s;at pow|erfully on my &s;pirits, and I was obliged at
<PB N="204" REF="219">la&s;t to make the following declaration to the ladies, which I did the third day after dinner.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Til&s;ton,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Lland&s;oy,</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible you have too high an opinion of what I have done to &s;erve you, and think there is more merit in it than there really is; for a man of any genero&s;ity and ability would, I imagine, do all that was po&s;&s;ible to deliver two young ladies of your charms and perfections, from the &s;lavery and mi&s;ery your guardian kept you in: I am likewi&s;e &s;ure you believe I would do every thing in my power, to &s;ecure your happine&s;s, and give you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every ble&s;&s;ing of time. I honour, I admire, I regard you both, to a high degree; and if I were &s;ome powerful <HI>genie,</HI> I would crown your lives with &s;table felicity and glory. But nature, ladies, has irrevocably fixed limits, beyond which we cannot pa&s;s, and my &s;phere of action is far from being large. My for|tune is not very great, and thereby prevents my being &s;o u&s;eful a friend to you as I would willingly be. However, though it is not in my power to do according to my inclination, in regard to your ca&s;e, and with &s;ecurity place you in &s;ome &s;tation fit for your rank and worth, yet I can bring you to a &s;pot of tran|quillity, and in &s;till life enable you to live without perplexity or care of any kind. You &s;hall have peace and little, and may perhaps hereafter &s;ay, you have enjoyed more real
<PB N="205" REF="220">happine&s;s, for the time you had occa&s;ion to re&s;ide there, than you could find in the tu|mult, pomp, and grandeur of the world.</P>
<P>Here I gave the ladies an account of <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> in the northern extremity of <HI>We&s;t|moreland,</HI> where I had lived a con&s;iderable time told them the condition it was in, the goods, the books, the liquors, and other ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniencies that were there, and if, in that charming romantic &s;pot, where no mortal could come to hurt them, they could bear to live for a while, I would &s;ettle them there, and get a man &s;ervant to work in the garden, and a couple of maids. I would likewi&s;e procure for them two cows, a few lambs, &s;ome poultry, and corn, and &s;eeds for the ground: in &s;hort, that they &s;hould have every thing requi&s;ite in &s;uch a place; I would return to them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; I would write to them often, directing my let|ters to the neare&s;t town, to be called for by their man. What do you &s;ay, ladies, to this propo&s;al? In <HI>London</HI> it is not po&s;&s;ible for you to be: at a farm-hou&s;e you might have no &s;atisfaction: and any where that was known and frequented, you may be liable to di&s;covery, as <HI>Cock,</HI> your guardian, will en|quire every where; and if he hears of you, you will be carried home mo&s;t certainly to his di&s;mal habitation, and be u&s;ed ten times
<PB N="206" REF="221">wor&s;e than before. What do you think then of this &s;cheme?</P>
<P>Sir, (they both replied) you are to us a &s;ubaltern power, by heaven &s;ent to deliver us from mi&s;ery, and &s;ecure our happine&s;s in this world. We have not words to expre&s;s the gratitude of our &s;ouls for this further in&s;tance of your goodne&s;s in the offer you make us, nor can it ever be in our power to make you the return it de&s;erves. You will be plea&s;ed to accept our grateful thanks, and all we have to add at pre&s;ent, our prayers for your pre&s;er|vation and health. Conduct us, we be&s;eech you, immediately to that &s;weet &s;pot of peace you have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This being agreed on, the next thing to be done was to get two hor&s;es for the ladies, for mine were not able to carry double any further, if there had been a turnpike road before us; then up the mountains we were to go, where no double hor&s;e could travel; and when they were at the Lodge, they would want hor&s;es to ride &s;ometimes, or to remove, if the nece&s;&s;ity of their ca&s;e &s;hould happen to require it: to my landlord there|fore I applied upon the occa&s;ion, and he very quickly got for me not only two pretty bea&s;ts, but a young labouring man, and two country girls to wait upon the ladies. I then &s;ent to the next town for a couple of &s;ide-&s;addles, gave the &s;ervants directions to go to the Rev.
<PB N="207" REF="222">Mr. <HI>Fleming</HI>'s hou&s;e, to wait there till they heard from me, and then we &s;et out for <HI>Or|ton-Ladge.</HI> Two days we &s;pent in travelling there, feeding on cold provi&s;ions we had with us, and lying a night on the fern of the mountains. The &s;econd evening we arrived at the Lodge. There I found every thing &s;afe, and the place as I had left it. I opened my various &s;tore-hou&s;es, to the &s;urprize of the young ladies, and brought them many good things; bi&s;cuits, potted char, potted black-cocks, &s;weetmeats, and liquors of va|rious kinds: <HI>O Fin</HI> likewi&s;e got us a di&s;h of trouts for &s;upper, and the two beauties and I &s;at down with chearfulne&s;s to our table.&mdash; Va&s;tly amazed they were at all they &s;aw. Every thing was &s;o good, and the wild charms of the place &s;o plea&s;ing, that they could not but expre&s;s the tran&s;ports they were in at their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The whole they &s;aid, was charming as inchantment, and in language there was not a force &s;ufficient to expre&s;s their grateful &s;entiments upon the occa&s;ion. This gave me much plea&s;ure, and till the end of <HI>June,</HI> I lived a very happy life with the&s;e fine young creatures. They did all that was po&s;&s;ible to &s;hew their e&s;teem and gratitude. Exclu&s;ive of their amaz|ing fine faces, and per&s;ons, they were ingenious, gay, and engaging, and made
<PB N="208" REF="223" MS="y">every minute of time delightful. If I had not been engaged to Mi&s;s <HI>Spence,</HI> I &s;hould certainly have &s;at down in peace with the&s;e two young ladies, and with them connected, have looked upon <HI>Orton-Lodge</HI> as the Garden of <HI>Eden.</HI> They were both mo&s;t charming women. Mi&s;s <HI>Lland&s;oy</HI> was a mere divi|nity!</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 1, 1731. My depar|ture from <HI>Orton-Lodge</HI> a &s;e|cond time: mi&s;&s;ed my road: the country de&s;cribed.</NOTE>&sect;. 1. THE fir&s;t of July, ju&s;t as the day was breaking, I mounted my hor&s;e, and went again from <HI>Orton-Lodge.</HI> The morning being extremely fine, and every thing appearing as in the above lines, I rid &s;oftly on for three or four hours, and was &s;o delighted with the beauties, and an infinite variety of lovely objects my eyes were fea&s;ted with, that I did not mind the way; and in&s;tead of coming to the turning that was my road, I got into a bending valley, which ended at a range of rocky mountains. For half an hour I travelled by the bottom of the&s;e frightful hills, and came at length to a pa&s;s through them, but &s;o narrow, that the bea&s;ts had not above an inch or two to &s;pare on each &s;ide. It was dark as the blacke&s;t night in this opening, and a &s;tream came from it, by the waters falling in &s;everal places from the top of the high inclo&s;ing precipices. It was as &s;hocking a foot-way as I had ever &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="226">
<HI>Finn,</HI> (I &s;aid to my young man) as the bottom is hard, and you can only be wet a little, will you try where this pa&s;s ends, and let me know what kind of country and in|habitants are beyond it? That I will, &s;aid <HI>O Finn,</HI> and immediately entred the cleft or crevice between the mountains. A couple of hours I allowed my adventurer to explore this dark way; but if in that time he could make nothing of it, then his orders were to return: but there was no &s;ign of him at the end of &s;ix hours, and I began to fear he had got into &s;ome pound. After him then I went, about one o'clock, and for near half a mile, the narrow way was directly forward, a rough bottom, and ancle deep in water; but it ended in a fine flowery green of about twenty acres, &s;urrounded with &s;teep rocky hills it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cend. Walking up to the precipice before me, I found many ca|verns in it, which extended on either hand, and onwards, into a va&s;t variety of caves; &s;ome of them having high arched openings for entrance, and others only holes to creep in at; but all of them &s;pacious within, and high enough for the talle&s;t man to walk in.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;mal chambers I apprehended my fellow had lo&s;t him&s;elf, and therefore went into them as far as I could venture, that is, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the day, and cried out <HI>Finn! Finn!</HI> but could hear no
<PB N="212" REF="227">&s;ound in return. This was a great trouble to me, and I knew not what to do. Back however I mu&s;t go to my hor&s;es, and after I had &s;pent two hours in &s;earching, &s;houting, and expecting my lad's return, by &s;ome means or other, I was ju&s;t going to walk to|wards the crevice, or dark narrow pa&s;s I had come through to this place, when ca&s;ting my eyes once more towards the caverns in the mountains, I &s;aw my boy come out, leaping and &s;inging for joy. He told me, he never expected to &s;ee the day-light more: for after he had fooli&s;hly gone too far into the caves, till he was quite in the dark, in hopes of finding a pa&s;&s;age through the mountain to &s;ome open country, he was obliged to wan|der from chamber to chamber he knew not where for many hours, without one ray of light, and with very little expectation of de|liverance; that he did nothing but cry and roar, and was hardly able to &s;tand on his legs any longer, when by a chance turn into a cave, he &s;aw &s;ome light again, and then &s;oon found his way out. Poor fellow! he was in a &s;ad condition, and very wonderful was his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>After this, we made what ha&s;te we could to our hor&s;es, which we had left feeding in the vale, and <HI>Finn</HI> brought me &s;ome cold provi&s;ions from his wallet for my dinner. I dined with great plea&s;ure, on account of the

We found the valley winded about the mountains for three miles, and then end|ed at the highe&s;t hill I had ever &s;een, but which it was po&s;&s;ible to a&s;cend. With great difficulty we and our hor&s;es got to the top of it, and down on the other &s;ide. Six mountains of the &s;ame height, who&s;e tops were above the clouds, we had to cro&s;s, and then arrived at a bottom, which formed a mo&s;t delightful &s;cene.</P>

<P>In this fine vale, I found one pretty little hou&s;e, which had gardens very beautifully laid out, and u&s;efully filled with the fine&s;t dwarf fruit trees and ever-greens, vegetables, herbs, and &s;hrubs. The man&s;ion, and the improved &s;pot of ground, were at the end of the beautiful lake, &s;o as to have the whole charming piece of water before the door. The projecting &s;haded fells &s;eemed to nod or hang over the habitation, and on either hand, a few yards from the front of the hou&s;e, ca&s;cades much higher than that of dread <HI>Lo|dore,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> fell into the lake.

<PB N="218" REF="233">inform you what the <HI>Talmud,</HI> and other writings of the <HI>Rabbies,</HI> are.&mdash;</P>
<P>The <HI>Talmud</HI> is a celebrated piece of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> literature, that is full of <HI>Rabinical</HI> domination and enthu&s;ia&s;m. The <HI>Rabbins</HI> pretend, this book contains the <HI>Oral</HI> laws, and other &s;ecrets, which God communicated to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, each of which is divided into &s;everal books. In the fir&s;t part, which they call <HI>Mi&s;h|na,</HI> is the <HI>text.</HI> In the other, is a &s;ort of <HI>comment</HI> on the text, and this is &s;tiled the <HI>Gemara.</HI></P>
<P>This oral law, or tradition of the <HI>Jews,</HI> was col|lected after the de&s;truction of the Temple, A. D. 150, by <HI>Rabbi Judah,</HI> and is by them preferred before the &s;cripture. They &s;uppo&s;e it was orally delivered by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and unlawful to be written; but when <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was de&s;troyed, they were con&s;trained to write it, lea&s;t it &s;hould be lo&s;t; but yet it was &s;o written, as that none but them&s;elves might under&s;tand it.&mdash;This <HI>Mi&s;hna</HI> and <HI>Gemara</HI> compleat the two <HI>Talmuds:</HI>&mdash;that of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> A. D. 230;&mdash;and that of <HI>Babylon,</HI> 500 years after Chri&s;t. Many parts of the&s;e <HI>Talmuds</HI> are tran&s;lated by &s;everal learned men, who have en|deavoured to render them intelligible: but in order to under&s;tand them fully, you mu&s;t read the <HI>Jad Cha&s;ka,</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;hna Torah</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es Maimonides,</HI> who was phy&s;ician to the king of <HI>Egypt</HI> about 600 years ago. This <HI>Rabbi</HI> hath comprized the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Mi&s;hna</HI> and <HI>Gemara</HI> of the <HI>Talmud,</HI> in his books, and enabled us to under&s;tand all the <HI>Mi&s;hna</HI> with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. See likewi&s;e the <HI>Clavis Talmudica, Cock's Excerpta,</HI> and the works of the excellent <HI>Ludivicus de Campeigne du Veil,</HI> who had been a <HI>Jew,</HI> but became a <HI>Roman Catholic;</HI> from <HI>Rome</HI> went over to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> where he was for &s;everal years in the character of a great divine: but at la&s;t turned <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> and died a member of that chri&s;tian church; which lo&s;t him all his friends and intere&s;t.

<P>As to the other two texts, the Jews do likewi&s;e attribute them to the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias.

<PB N="222" REF="237" MS="y">are amazed, perplexed, and confounded a|bout him. They di&s;pute on the article, and have the wilde&s;t fancies in relation to it.

<P>Again: in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> ix. 6. we have the&s;e words: <HI>Unto us a child is born, unto us a &s;on is given, and the government &s;hall be upon his &s;houlders: and his name &s;hall be called Wonderful, Coun&s;el|lor, the Mighty God, the Everla&s;ting Father, the Prince of Peace.</HI> Or as the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> MS. hath it, <HI>He &s;hall call his name the Angel, Won|derful, Coun&s;ellor, Mighty, the Governor, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come.</HI> This is thought by all <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to be a plain declaration of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias;</HI> for to apply it to any mere mortal, as to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> or <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s &s;on, cannot be done without the greate&s;t ab|&s;urdity: and therefore <HI>Ben Maimon (epi&s;t. ad Afric.)</HI> fairly yields that the&s;e words belong to the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and &s;o doth <HI>Jonathan Ben Uziel</HI> in his <HI>Chaldee</HI> paraphra&s;e.

<P>But further; as to the birth of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> in re&s;pect of the manner and the place, it is thus &s;et down by the prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> v. 2. <HI>And thou Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little among the thou&s;ands of Judah, yet out of thee &s;hall come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in I&s;rael; who&s;e goings forth have been of old, even from everla&s;ting.</HI>&mdash;And in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> vii. 14. are the&s;e words, <HI>Behold a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bring forth a &s;on, and call his name Im|manuel.</HI> In the&s;e two texts, (the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ay) the <HI>place</HI> of the <HI>birth</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and the <HI>manner</HI> of it, are as plainly de&s;cribed as words can do; and if they cannot, without ab&s;urdity, be explained as relating to any other per&s;on, then it mu&s;t be perverting the meaning of the records, to oppo&s;e this expli|cation: but this the <HI>Jews</HI> are far from doing. The <HI>place</HI> is acknowledged in the <HI>Talmud,</HI> in the <HI>Chaldee paraphra&s;e</HI> of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and all their mo&s;t famous <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> declare with one voice, that <HI>Bethlehem</HI> indi&s;putably belongs to the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias. Exte Bethlehem coram me prodibit Me&s;&s;ias, ut &s;it dominium exercens in I&s;rael, cu|jus nomen dictum e&s;t ab aeternitate, a Diebus &s;eculi. (Talmud. lib. Sanhedrim, et Midra&s;ch. The hillinic Rabbi Selemoh. paraph. Jonath. in Loc. Rabbi David Kimchi.)</HI>&mdash;And as to
<PB N="224" REF="239">the <HI>manner,</HI> tho' it be true that &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ay, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Gnalma</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>young woman</HI> as well as a <HI>virgin;</HI> yet <HI>Kimell, Jarchi,</HI> and <HI>Selemoh,</HI> three of their greate&s;t <HI>Rabbins,</HI> confe&s;s that here is &s;omething won|derful pre&s;aged in the birth and generation of this per&s;on, and that he was not to be born as other men and women are born. What can we de&s;ire more, in the ca&s;e, from an ene|my? And in truth, the <HI>behold,</HI> or wonder, with which the text begins, would be no|thing, if it was only that a young woman &s;hould have a child: &mdash; and as to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Gnalmah,</HI> if it ever does &s;ignify a young women, which I very much doubt, yet in the tran&s;lation of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> who well un|der&s;tood the original &s;urely, they render the word by <HI>parthenos,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">in <HI>Graec;</HI> which always &s;ignifies a virgin in the &s;trict propriety of the phra&s;e.

<P>Such are the advantages we may gain by reading the books of the <HI>Rabbins;</HI> and to me it is plea&s;ing to &s;ee the&s;e great <HI>Hebrew ma&s;ters</HI> granting &s;o much to us for our <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> while they hate our holy religion beyond every thing.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;crip|tion of a dropping well.</NOTE>As to the famous <HI>dropping-well</HI> or <HI>petrifying water,</HI> it lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town and river, about 26 yards from the bank of the <HI>Nid.</HI> It ri&s;es 15 yards below the top of a mountain of marle &s;tone, and in four falls, of about two yards each fall, comes to an ea&s;y a&s;cent, where it &s;preads upon the top of an <HI>i&s;thmus</HI> of a <HI>petrified rock,</HI> generated out of the water, which falls down round it. This <HI>i&s;thmus</HI> or rock is ten yards high, and hangs over its ba&s;e or bottom about 5 yards. It is near 16 yards long and 13 broad, and as it &s;tarted from the bank about fifty years ago, leaves a cha&s;m between them, that is about three yards wide. In this cha&s;m, you will find petrified twigs of trees, &s;hrubs, and gra&s;s-roots, hang|ing in mo&s;t beautiful pillars, all interwoven, and forming many charming figures; and on the common &s;ide are whole banks like <HI>Stalac|tilites,</HI> hard and in&s;eparable from the rock, where the water trickles down.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;erva|tions on petrifying waters.</NOTE>Mo&s;t people are of opinion, that <HI>petrifying water</HI> is dangerous drink, and may produce abundance of mi&s;chief, in cau&s;ing the &s;tone and gravel in the body: the original particles or principles of the &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance called <HI>&s;par,</HI> which are in abundance &s;u&s;pended in this kind of water, mu&s;t get into the flood-gates of the kidneys and ureters, (as they opine) and create great mi&s;ery in a little time.</P>
<P>But this fear of <HI>petrefactions</HI> in living ani|mal bodies is grounded upon neither rea&s;on nor experience; for the <HI>&s;par</HI> in the&s;e waters forms no <HI>petrefactions,</HI> whil&s;t in a bri&s;k mo|tion, or in a temperate &s;ea&s;on, or on vege|tables while they pre&s;erve their vegetating life.

Human invention has nothing equal to them for fluxes of any part of the body, or colliquations from an acid &s;alt. So far are they from being in the lea&s;t dangerous, that in all unnatural di&s;|charges, by &s;pitting, &s;tool, or urine; by ex|ce&s;&s;ive men&s;trual or haemorrhoidal fluxes, in the fluor albus, diabetes, profu&s;e &s;weatings; in the diarrhoea, dyfentry, or lienteria (where the &s;prings are not quite worn out:) in ulcers of the vi&s;cera, hectic fevers, atrophy, and colliquations or night &s;weats, there is not any thing in phy&s;ic more profitable or plea&s;ant, to recover a patient. Let your do&s;e, in &s;uch ca&s;es, be three half-pints of <HI>Knare&s;borough dropping-well</HI> in the forenoon; and before you begin to drink this water, remember to take two do&s;es of rhubarb, to clean&s;e off the ex|crements of the fir&s;t vi&s;cera. You mu&s;t not drink ale, drams, or punch, during a cour&s;e of the&s;e waters: and take but very little red port. You mu&s;t likewi&s;e have a &s;trict regard to diet.

You mu&s;t avoid all &s;alt, &s;harp, &s;timulating things, day-&s;leep, and night-air: but agree|able conver&s;ation, and diver&s;ions that require very little exerci&s;e, conduce to the &s;ucce&s;s of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>War|drew</HI> &s;ul|phur-wa|ter.</NOTE>In <HI>Northumberland,</HI> on the borders of <HI>Cum|berland,</HI> there is a place called <HI>Wardrew,</HI> to the north-we&s;t of <HI>Thirlwall-ca&s;tle,</HI> which &s;tands on that part of the picts-wall, where it cro&s;&s;es the <HI>Tippel,</HI> and is known by the name of <HI>Murus Perforatus,</HI> (in <HI>Saxon, Thirlwall</HI>) on account of the gaps made in the wall at this place for the <HI>Scots</HI> pa&s;&s;age.

The di&s;charge is fifty gallons in a minute from a mixture of lime&s;tone and iron&s;tone. And the water is &s;o very foetid, that it is diffi|cult to &s;wallow it. The way to it is not ea&s;y, for there is no other pa&s;&s;age than along a very narrow ledge, about nine inches broad, which has been cut off the rock over the deep river, and if you &s;lip, (as you may ea&s;ily do, having nothing to hold by) down you go into a wa|ter that looks very black and &s;hocking, by the &s;hade of the hanging precipice, and &s;ome aged trees which project from the va&s;t cliff.</P>
<P>This dangerous &s;ituation, and its remote|ne&s;s, will prevent its being ever much vi&s;ited, admirable as the &s;paw is; yet the country-people

<PB N="240" REF="255">us &s;o to improve the &s;upreme and mo&s;t god|like powers of our con&s;titution, and &s;o di&s;|charge the duties impo&s;ed upon us by our Creator, that when we return into that &s;ilence we were in before we exi&s;ted, and our places &s;hall know us no more, we may pa&s;s from the un&s;table condition of terre&s;trial affairs to that eternal &s;tate in the heavens, where ever|la&s;ting plea&s;ures and enjoyments are prepared for tho&s;e who have lived in the delightful exerci&s;e of the powers of rea&s;on, and per|formed all &s;ocial and kind offices to others, out of a &s;en&s;e of duty to God. Thus does truth oblige us. It is the ba&s;is of morality, as morality is the ba&s;is of religion.</P>
<P>This, I think, is a ju&s;t account of <HI>moral truth and rectitude,</HI> and &s;hews that it is e&s;&s;en|tially glorious in it&s;elf, and the &s;acred rule to which all things mu&s;t bend, and all agents &s;ubmit.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of revelation.</NOTE>The <HI>&s;y&s;tem of moral truth and revelation,</HI> (it may be an&s;wered) are united, and at per|fect amity with each other. <HI>Morality</HI> and the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> &s;tand on the <HI>&s;ame foundation;</HI> and differ only in this, that revealed religion, in re&s;pect of the corrupt and degenerate &s;tate
<PB N="241" REF="256">of mankind, has brought fre&s;h light, and additional a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to direct, &s;upport, and fix men in their duty. We have hi&s;tories which relate an early deviation from moral truth, and inform us that this di&s;ea&s;e of our rational nature &s;pread like a contagion. The ca&s;e became wor&s;e, and more deplorable, in &s;ucceeding ages; and as evil examples and prejudices added new force to the prevailing pa&s;&s;ions, and rea&s;on and liberty of will, for want of due exerci&s;e, grew weaker, and le&s;s able to regain their lo&s;t dominion, corruption was rendered univer&s;al. Then did the true God, the Father of the Univer&s;e, and the mo&s;t provident and beneficent of Beings, interpo&s;e by a revelation of his will, and by advice and authority, do all that was po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the &s;elf-de&s;tructive effects of the culpable ig|norance and folly of his offspring. He gave the world a <HI>tran&s;cript</HI> of the <HI>law of nature</HI> by an extraordinary me&s;&s;enger, the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who had power given him to work miracles, to rou&s;e mankind from their fatal &s;tupidity, to &s;et their thoughts on work, and to conciliate their attention to the hea|venly declaration. In this <HI>republication</HI> of the <HI>original law,</HI> he gave them doctrines and commandments perfectly con&s;onant to the pure&s;t rea&s;on, and to them annexed <HI>&s;anctions</HI> that do really bind and <HI>oblige</HI> men, as they not only guard and &s;trengthen religion, but
<PB N="242" REF="257">affect our natural <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</HI> Re|ligion appears to great di&s;advantage, when divines preach it into a <HI>bond of indemnity,</HI> and a <HI>mere contract of intere&s;t;</HI> but exclu&s;ive of this, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the <HI>&s;anctions</HI> of the go&s;pel have a weight, awfulne&s;s, and &s;olemnity, that prove to a great degree effec|tual. <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>advantage</HI> are rea&s;ons for well-doing.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the evidence of the obligation of the duties of natural religion is as <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>&s;trong</HI> from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> as any <HI>revelation</HI> can make it; but yet the means of rendering the&s;e du|ties <HI>effectual</HI> in practice, are not &s;o clear and powerful from mere rea&s;on, as from revela|tion. The proof of obligation is equally <HI>&s;trong</HI> in rea&s;on and in&s;piration, but the obli|gation it&s;elf is rendered <HI>&s;tronger</HI> by the go&s;pel, by &s;uperadded means or motives. The pri|mary obligation of natural religion ari&s;es from the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of things, as being ob|jects of our rational moral faculties, agreeably to which we cannot but be obliged to act; and this obligation is <HI>&s;trengthened</HI> by the ten|dency of natural religion to the final hap|pine&s;s of every rational agent: but the clear knowledge, and expre&s;s promi&s;es which we have in the go&s;pel, of the nature and great|ne&s;s of this final happine&s;s, being added to the obligation from, and the tendency of rea|&s;on or natural religion to the final happine&s;s
<PB N="243" REF="258">of human nature, the obligation of it is there|by &s;till more &s;trengthened. In this lies the benefit of chri&s;tianity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the My&s;teries, Trinity, and Sacri|fice of the Cro&s;s.</NOTE>But if this be the ca&s;e, it may be a&s;ked, Where are our holy my&s;teries&mdash;and what do you think of our Redemption? If natural rea&s;on and con&s;cience can do &s;o much, and to the go&s;pel we are obliged only for a little more light and influence, then Trinity in Unity, and the Sacrifice of the Cro&s;s are nothing. What are your &s;entiments on the&s;e &s;ubjects?</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Trinity,</HI> it is a word invented by the doctors, and &s;o far as I can find, was never once thought of by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and his apo&s;tles; unle&s;s it was to guard again&s;t the &s;pread of <HI>trithei&s;m,</HI> by taking the greate&s;t care to inculcate the <HI>&s;upreme divinity</HI> of <HI>God the Father:</HI> but let it be a trinity, &s;ince the church will have it &s;o, and by it I under&s;tand one Uncreated, and one Created, and a cer|tain divine virtue of quality. The&s;e I find in the Bible, <HI>God, Je&s;us the Word,</HI> and a <HI>Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> or <HI>Holy Wind,</HI> (not Holy Gho&s;t, as we have tran&s;lated it): called a <HI>Wind,</HI> be|cau&s;e God, <HI>from whom every good and perfect
<PB N="244" REF="259">gift cometh,</HI> gave the mo&s;t extraordinary in|&s;tance of it under the emblem of a <HI>Wind;</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> becau&s;e it was &s;upernatural. This is the &s;cripture doctrine, in relation to the <HI>Deity,</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and the <HI>Energy</HI> of God; of which the <HI>Wind</HI> was promi&s;ed as a pledge, and was given as an emblem, when the day of <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI> was come; and if the&s;e three they will call a Trinity, I &s;hall not di&s;pute about the word. But to &s;ay <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is God, though the apo&s;tles tell us, that <HI>God rai&s;ed from the dead the Man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom they killed; that he had exalted him at his right hand, and had made him both Lord and Chri&s;t;</HI> and to affirm that this <HI>Gho&s;t</HI> (as they render the word <HI>Wind</HI>) is a per&s;on di&s;tinct and dif|ferent from the per&s;on of God the Father, and equally &s;upreme;&mdash;this I cannot agree to. If the &s;cripture is true, all this appears to me to be fal&s;e. It is a mere invention of the Monks.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Redemption,</HI> it may be in perfect con&s;i&s;tence and agreement with truth and rectitude, if the accompli&s;hment of it be con|&s;idered as <HI>premial,</HI> and as re&s;ulting from a <HI>per&s;onal reward:</HI> but to regard the accom|pli&s;hment as <HI>penal,</HI> and as re&s;ulting from a <HI>vicarious puni&s;hment,</HI> is a notion that cannot be reconciled to the principle of rectitude. Vicarious puni&s;hment or &s;uffering appears an impo&s;&s;ibility: but as <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by adding the
<PB N="245" REF="260">mo&s;t exten&s;ive benevolence to perfect inno|cence, and by becoming obedient to death, even the death of the cro&s;s, was mo&s;t <HI>meri|torious,</HI> and was entitled to the highe&s;t ho|nour, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed reward, <HI>his re|ward</HI> might be <HI>our deliverance from the bonds of &s;in and death,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;toration of immor|tality.</HI> This reward was worthy of the giver, and tended to the advancement and &s;pread of virtue. It was likewi&s;e mo&s;t acceptable to the receiver. It no way interfered with right and truth. It was in all re&s;pects mo&s;t proper and &s;uitable. The&s;e are my &s;entiments of Redemption. This appears to me to be the truth on the mo&s;t attentive and impartial ex|amination I have been capable of making.</P>
<P>To this, perhaps, &s;ome people may reply, that though the&s;e notions are, for the mo&s;t part ju&s;t, and in the ca&s;e of redemption, in particular, as innocence and puni&s;hment are incon&s;i&s;tent and incompatible ideas, that it was not po&s;&s;ible Chri&s;t's oblation of him&s;elf could be more than a <HI>figurative &s;acrifice,</HI> in re&s;pect of <HI>tran&s;lation of guilt, commutation of per&s;ons,</HI> and <HI>vicarious infliction;</HI> though a <HI>real &s;acrifice</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of intending by the obla|tion to procure the <HI>favour of God,</HI> and the <HI>indemnity of &s;inners:</HI> yet, as the author ap|pears to be a <HI>Socinian,</HI> his account is liable to objections. For, though the <HI>Socinians</HI> ac|knowledge the truth and nece&s;&s;ity of the re|velation
<PB N="246" REF="261">of the go&s;pel, yet, in the opinion of &s;ome great divines, they interpret it in &s;uch a manner, as no unprejudiced per&s;on, who has read the &s;criptures, with any attention, nor any &s;en&s;ible heathen, who &s;hould read them, can po&s;&s;ibly believe. They make our Redeemer a man, and by this doctrine re|flect the greate&s;t di&s;honour on chri&s;tianity, and its Divine Author.</P>
<P>This is a hard charge. The <HI>Socinians</HI> are by the&s;e divines de&s;cribed as people who read the &s;criptures with prejudice, and without attention; men more &s;en&s;ele&s;s than the Hea|thens, and as wicked too; for, in the highe&s;t degree, they di&s;honour Chri&s;t Je&s;us and his religion. A&s;toni&s;hing a&s;&s;ertion! It puts me in mind of an imputation of the celebrated <HI>Waterland</HI> in his &s;econd charge;&mdash;"What athei&s;m chiefly aims at, is, to &s;it loo&s;e from pre&s;ent re&s;traints and future reckonings; and the&s;e two purpo&s;es may be competently &s;erved by <HI>dei&s;m,</HI> which is a <HI>more refined kind of a|thei&s;m.</HI> &mdash;Groundle&s;s and ridiculous calumny. <HI>True and proper dei&s;m</HI> is a <HI>&s;incere belief of the exi&s;tence of a God,</HI> and <HI>of an impartial di&s;tri|bution of rewards and puni&s;hments in another world, and a practice that naturally re&s;ults from, and is con&s;onant to &s;uch belief;</HI> and if athei&s;m aims to &s;it loo&s;e from re&s;traints and reckon|ings, then of con&s;equence, <HI>dei&s;m</HI> is the <HI>grand barrier</HI> to the purpo&s;es of athei&s;m. The <HI>true
<PB N="247" REF="262">Dei&s;t</HI> is &s;o far from breaking through re&s;traints, that he makes it the great bu&s;ine&s;s of his life <HI>to di&s;charge the obligations he is under,</HI> becau&s;e he <HI>believes in God,</HI> and perceives the <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of <HI>duties, re&s;traints,</HI> and <HI>future reckonings.</HI> The <HI>a&s;&s;ertion</HI> therefore de|mon&s;trates the <HI>prejudice</HI> of Dr. <HI>Waterland,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Dei&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>And the ca&s;e is the &s;ame in re&s;pect of the <HI>charge</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Socinians.</HI> It is the <HI>divines</HI> that are prejudiced again&s;t them; and not the <HI>Socinians</HI> in &s;tudying the New Te&s;tament. It is the grand purpo&s;e of our lives to <HI>wor&s;hip God,</HI> and <HI>form our religious notions according to the in&s;tructions of divine wi&s;dom.</HI> We exa|mine the &s;acred writings, with the utmo&s;t de&s;ire, and mo&s;t ardent prayer, that we may be rightly informed in the true&s;t &s;en&s;e of the holy authors of tho&s;e divine books; and it appears to our plain under&s;tandings, after the mo&s;t hone&s;t labour, and wi&s;hes to heaven for a clear conception of holy things, that <HI>the Fa|ther is the &s;upreme God,</HI> that is, the fir&s;t and chief Being, and Agent; the fir&s;t and chief Go|vernor; the Fountain of Being, Agency, and authority: that the <HI>Chri&s;tian Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was &s;ent into the world to bear witne&s;s to the truth, and preach the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, that kingdom of God which is within you,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Luke</HI> xvii. 21. not a <HI>kingdom of Monks,</HI> a <HI>&s;acerdotal empire</HI> of <HI>power, pro|po&s;itions,</HI>

It is true, original chri&s;tianity, and if the glorious de&s;ign of our Lord is an&s;wered by his <HI>miracles</HI> and <HI>preaching,</HI> by his <HI>death,</HI> his <HI>re&s;urrection,</HI> his <HI>a&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and by the <HI>grace of the holy, ble&s;&s;ed, and &s;anctifying Spirit,</HI> it could reflect no di&s;honour on chri&s;tianity, and its divine author, if our Redeemer was a <HI>meer man.</HI> If by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God Almighty, a <HI>mere man</HI> performed the whole work of our
<PB N="249" REF="264">redemption, all we had to do was to be thank|ful for the mighty ble&s;&s;ing. The love of God in this way had been equally ine&s;tima|ble. The worth of Je&s;us would be &s;till in|valuable.</P>
<P>But it is not the opinion of the <HI>Socinians</HI> that Chri&s;t was a <HI>mere man.</HI> It is plain from this a&s;&s;ertion, that the Rev. Dr. <HI>Heathcote,</HI> (in his Remarks on free and candid Di&s;qui&s;i|tions) knows nothing of them: the account they give of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is very different. They &s;ay, he was a mo&s;t glorious agent united to a human body, and &s;o far from being a <HI>mere man,</HI> that he was &s;uperior to angels. He was the next in character to the nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ting Being. He is the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on: he has an excellency tran&s;cendent, and to the life repre&s;ents what is infinitely great and perfect.</P>
<P>If they do not allow that he made the worlds, or had an eternal generation; if they &s;ay, he had no exi&s;tence till he was formed by the power of God in the womb, and a&s;|&s;ert this eminency is proper to the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> yet they are far from affirming he was therefore a <HI>mere man:</HI> no; they believe he was decreed to be as great and glorious as po&s;&s;ible, and that God made the world for him; that he was made the <HI>image</HI> of the <HI>in|vi&s;ible per&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Father; an image the mo&s;t
<PB N="250" REF="265">expre&s;s and exact;</HI> as great as God him&s;elf could make it; and of con&s;equence, &s;o tran|&s;cendent in all perfections, that what he &s;ays and does is the &s;ame thing as if God had &s;po|ken and acted. This is not making him a <HI>mere man.</HI> No: they &s;ay he is the <HI>fir&s;t of all,</HI> and the <HI>head of all creatures,</HI> whom the infi|nite love of God produced, to promote great|ne&s;s, glory, and happine&s;s among the crea|tures, by the &s;uperlative greatne&s;s and glory of Je&s;us; and that angels, and the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, might have the plea&s;ure of beholding and enjoying the pre&s;ence of this mo&s;t glorious Image, that is, of &s;eeing their invi&s;ible Creator in his <HI>Image Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> He is not a <HI>mere man;</HI> but the <HI>brightne&s;s of the glory of God,</HI> the <HI>expre&s;s Image of his per|&s;on,</HI> and rai&s;ed &s;o much higher than <HI>the angels,</HI> as he has inherited from God a more excellent name than they, to wit, the name of <HI>Son,</HI> and is the <HI>appointed heir of all things.</HI></P>
<P>So that this <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI> reflects no di&s;honour on Chri&s;tianity and its Divine Author. It conduces as much to the glory of God, and the benefit of man, as any chri&s;tianity can do. There is &s;omething va&s;tly beautiful and &s;atisfactory in the notion of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> being the <HI>mo&s;t glorious Image</HI> of the <HI>invi&s;ible Father,</HI> when|ever his exi&s;tence began. The many tran|&s;cendent excellencies of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> in <HI>whom
<PB N="251" REF="266">all fulne&s;s dwells,</HI> are exerci&s;ed upon men to their happine&s;s, and to his glory; and we learn from thence, that greatne&s;s and glory are the re&s;ult of the exerci&s;e of virtue to the relief and happine&s;s of others. The Redeemer of the world is, in this account, the next in dignity and power to the Great God; and the perfections of the Father do mo&s;t emi|nently &s;hine forth in him. We are hereby made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the &s;aints in light, and delivered from the power of darkne&s;s. We give thanks unto the Father, who hath tran&s;lated us into the king|dom of the Son of his love.</P>
<P>It is certain then that the divines have <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> the people, who are <HI>injuriou&s;ly</HI> called <HI>Socinians,</HI> as the religion they profe&s;s is <HI>Scripture-Chri&s;tianity:</HI> I &s;ay <HI>injuriou&s;ly,</HI> be|cau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, the word <HI>Socinian</HI> is intended as a term of great reproach to chri&s;tians, who de&s;erve better u&s;age for the <HI>goodne&s;s of their manners,</HI> and the <HI>purity of their faith:</HI> and in the next place, that <HI>So|cinus</HI> was &s;o far from being the author of our religion, that he was not even the fir&s;t re&s;torer of it. He did not go to <HI>Poland</HI> to teach the people there his religious notions, but becau&s;e there was a unitarian congregation there, with whom he might join in the <HI>wor&s;hip of the Father, through Je&s;us the Mediator,</HI> as his

<HEAD><HI>Ob&s;ervations relative to Mi&s;s</HI> Dudgeon<HI>'s Prayer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This prayer plea&s;ed me very much. In the mo&s;t beautiful manner, as well as in a few words, it ex|pre&s;&s;es all we need a&s;k from heaven; and if Mi&s;s <HI>Dudgeon</HI> of <HI>Richmond&s;hire</HI> was the compo&s;er of it, as I have been a&s;&s;ured &s;ince, upon enquiry, I here place it to her honour, as a monument of her piety and &s;en&s;e; and in hopes the illu&s;trious of her &s;ex will u&s;e &s;o &s;hort and excellent a form of devotion in their clo&s;ets morning and night.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="277">
There is an expre&s;&s;ion in this prayer, which for &s;ome time I could not well comprehend the meaning of; that is, <HI>Make my heart one:</HI> but on con&s;idering it, I found it &s;upported by the greate&s;t authorities.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ayings of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> one is, be <HI>&s;imply thy&s;elf.</HI> Reduce thy conduct to <HI>one &s;ingle aim,</HI> by bring|ing every pa&s;&s;ion into &s;ubjection, and acquiring that general habit of &s;elf-denial, which comprehends tem|perance, moderation, patience, government, and is the main principle of wi&s;dom. Be &s;imply thy&s;elf, and &s;o curb de&s;ire, and re&s;train the inclinations, and controul the affections, that you may be always able to move the pa&s;&s;ions as rea&s;on &s;hall direct. Let not every foremo&s;t fancy, or every forward appearance, have the lea&s;t ma&s;tery over you; but view them on every &s;ide by the clear light of rea&s;on, and be no fur|ther influenced by the imaginations of plea&s;ure, and apprehen&s;ions of evil, than as the obvious <HI>relations and nature of things</HI> allow. Let the re&s;ult of a perception which every rational mind may have of the e&s;&s;ential difference between good and evil, the be <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or <HI>ground of obligation.</HI> This will add greatly to quiet, and be productive of much real felicity. It will render every pre&s;ent condition &s;upportable, brighten every pro&s;pect, and always incline us more to hope than to fear. This is the doctrine of <HI>Pythagoras.</HI></P>
<P>I likewi&s;e find that <HI>David</HI> expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame thought in the 86th P&s;alm, ver. 11. which is rendered in the Bible tran&s;lation, <HI>Unite my heart to fear thy name;</HI>&mdash;in the Common-Prayer Book, <HI>O knit my heart unto thee,
<PB N="263" REF="278">that I may fear thy name:</HI> but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, "<HI>Make my heart one,</HI> to fear thy name;" meaning, Let the fear of thee be the <HI>one ruling di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of my &s;oul, in oppo&s;i|tion to the <HI>double-minded</HI> man, which the <HI>Hebrew</HI> ele|gantly expre&s;&s;es by a <HI>heart and a heart;</HI> one that draws to the riches, plea&s;ures, and honours of this world; and another to the practice of all virtue.</P>
<P>As to the other part of the prayer, which has the words&mdash;<HI>glorious&mdash;fearful&mdash;Jehovah;</HI>&mdash;whereas in the 86th P&s;alm it is only &s;aid&mdash;"to fear thy name;" the author certainly took them from the 28th chapter of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> ver. 58. The de&s;ign of the dreadful threatnings in this chapter &s;et before the people, is there thus expre&s;&s;ed,&mdash;<HI>that thou maye&s;t fear this glorious and fearful name,</HI> JEHOVAH THY GOD; (in our tran&s;|lation, <HI>the Lord thy God</HI>). And therefore I think the&s;e words are very finely u&s;ed in this prayer.</P>
<P>"It is amazing to me (&s;ays the <HI>Rector</HI> of <HI>St. Mabyn</HI>), that throughout the Bible, the tran&s;lators have every where changed the word <HI>Jehovah</HI> for the word <HI>Lord,</HI> when God him&s;elf gave the word <HI>Jehovah</HI> as his name to be uttered; and as in this word the whole my&s;tery of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ations &s;eem to have been wrapped up.</P>
<P>Say to the people, <HI>Ami Jehovah. I am Jehovah. Ye &s;hall know that I Jehovah am your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egygtians.</HI> Exod. vi. 6, 7. And <HI>Deut.</HI> vi. 4. <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.</HI></P>
<P>Then as to this word's comprehending the two di&s;|pen&s;ations, a good writer ob&s;erves that, though God was known to his true wor&s;hippers by many other
<PB N="264" REF="279">names, as <HI>God Almighty, the High God, the Everla&s;ting God, &amp;c.</HI> yet <HI>Jehovah</HI> was his one <HI>peculiar</HI> name; a name which he had appointed to him&s;elf, in preference to all others, and by which he declared by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> he would be di&s;tingui&s;hed for the time to come.</P>
<P>And as of all the names of God, this &s;eems to be the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of his e&s;&s;ence, as it can only be derived from the <HI>root</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>to be,</HI> and denotes the <HI>one eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent Being, from whom</HI> all other things <HI>derive their being,</HI> and <HI>on whom</HI> they mu&s;t depend; &mdash;As the word does likewi&s;e &s;ignify <HI>makes to be what was promi&s;ed or foretold,</HI> and by &s;uch meaning declares, as often as the word is repeated, that <HI>Jehovah</HI> our God is not only <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent,</HI> and the <HI>Creator of the world,</HI> but <HI>Him in whom all divine prophecies and predictions centre;</HI> it follows, in my opinion, that we &s;hould utter this <HI>awful name</HI> in our addre&s;&s;es to God, and not, like the <HI>Jews,</HI> through a &s;uper&s;tition omit it, and u&s;e another in&s;tead of it."</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Rector</HI> of <HI>St. Mabyn</HI> is the Rev. Mr. <HI>Peters;</HI> and the pa&s;&s;age is to be found in an excellent Preface to the octavo edition of his admirable <HI>Di&s;&s;er|tation on the Book of Job,</HI> in reply to that part of the <HI>Divine Legation of Mo&s;es demon&s;trated,</HI> in which the au|thor, my Lord of <HI>Glouce&s;ier,</HI> &s;ets him&s;elf to prove, that this <HI>book</HI> is a <HI>work of imagination,</HI> or <HI>dramatic compo&s;ition,</HI> no older than <HI>Ezra</HI> the prie&s;t, whom he &s;uppofes to be the writer of it, in the year before Chri&s;t 467, or the year 455, in the 20th year of the reign of <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> king of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> when <HI>Daniel</HI>'s &s;eventy weeks begins; that is, the period of 490 years, that were to be ful|filled before the pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour. And further,
<PB N="265" REF="280">(according to the author of the <HI>Legation</HI>), that this <HI>allegorical drama</HI> or <HI>poem</HI> was written to &s;quiet the minds of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people under the difficulties of their captivity, and to a&s;&s;ure them, as repre&s;ented by the per&s;on of <HI>Job,</HI> of tho&s;e great temporal ble&s;&s;ings which three prophets had predicted.</P>
<P>Now in the Preface to the book aforementioned, in an&s;wer to all this (and fully and beautifully an&s;wered it is), you will find, I &s;ay, the pa&s;&s;age relating to the word <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and more than I have quoted from it.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Pythagoras</HI> the <HI>Samean,</HI> mentioned in this note, on account of his &s;aying&mdash;<HI>Be &s;imply thy&s;elf;</HI>&mdash;he was famous in the 60th olympiad, as <HI>Jamblicus</HI> informs us; that is, his <HI>Elikia,</HI> or <HI>Reign of-Fame,</HI> began in the fir&s;t year of this olympiad, which was the year before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 540; for 60 &times; 4 gives 250 &minus; 777 leaves 537 &plus; 3, the plus years of the olympiad; <HI>i. e.</HI> 2, 3, 4 &equals; 540.&mdash;And he died in the 4th year of the 70th olympiad, that is, the year before Chri&s;t 497: for 70 &times; 4 &equals; 280 &minus; 777 remains 497: there are no plus years to be added here, as it happened in the 4th or la&s;t year of the olympiad. This philo&s;opher was con|temporary with, and a near friend to, the renowned <HI>Phalaris,</HI> who was murdered in the year before Chri&s;t 556, when the <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI> of <HI>Daniel</HI> a&s;cended the throne of <HI>Babylon.</HI> And as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> lived to the age of 90, according to <HI>Diogenes,</HI> he mu&s;t have been born in the beginning of the reign of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> the year this conqueror took <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and its king <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> which was olymp. 47.3. and of con&s;equence before Chri&s;t 590: for 47 &times; 4 &equals; 188 &minus; 777, remains 580 &plus; 1=590. This was 54 years before <HI>The&s;pis</HI> in|vented
<PB N="266" REF="281"><HI>tragedy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olymp. 61.1. Selden's Comment on the Arundel Marble.</NOTE> and 11 years before the birth of <HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> the reformer of tragedy. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was then in the 10th year of his age.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e evident from hence, that <HI>Pythagoras</HI> mu&s;t have lived through the reigns of <HI>Cyrus, Camby&s;es,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of the reign of <HI>Darius Hi&s;ta&s;pes,</HI> who &s;lew <HI>Smerdis</HI> the <HI>Magi,</HI> and is called in &s;cripture <HI>Aba&s;uerus;</HI> the king of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who married <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> and ordered <HI>Haman</HI> the <HI>Amalekite</HI> to be hanged on the gal|laws he had erected for <HI>Mordecai</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> in the year before Chri&s;t 510.</P>
<P>Note, <HI>David</HI> was before <HI>Pythagoras</HI> 519 years.</P>
<P>Reader, As to the word <HI>Elikia,</HI> which I have u&s;ed to expre&s;s the <HI>reign</HI> or time of <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> of <HI>Pythagoras;</HI> I have an ob&s;ervation or two to make in relation to it, which I think worth your attending to.</P>

<P>From this pa&s;&s;age it is plain, that the <HI>Elikia</HI> of <HI>Solo|mon</HI> is not meant of his nativity, but of the beginning of his reign, when he was 33 years of age.</P>
<P>It is then very &s;urpri&s;ing that <HI>Dodwell</HI> &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon it, that <HI>Elikia</HI> always &s;ignifies <HI>nativity.</HI> It is the more wonderful, as <HI>Dodwell</HI> quotes this pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Clement;</HI> and as it is impo&s;&s;ible to make out 610,
<PB N="267" REF="282">without coming to the 33d of <HI>Solomon,</HI> as I have rec|koned it.</P>
<P>Nay, in another place of the <HI>Stromata, Clement</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I&s;aiah, Ho&s;ea,</HI> and <HI>Micah</HI> lived after the <HI>Elikia</HI> of <HI>Ly|curgus;</HI> where he can only mean the time when that lawgiver flouri&s;hed; for, from the <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI> to the <HI>Akm&eacute;</HI> of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> was 290 years: and from <HI>So|lomon,</HI> in who&s;e time <HI>Troy</HI> was taken, to the time of the prophets, was 360 years.</P>
<P>Thus does learning accommodate things. <HI>Dod|well</HI> wanted to fit a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Antilochus</HI> to his own calculation, and &s;o 312 years from the <HI>Elikia</HI> of <HI>Py|thagoras,</HI> that is, &s;ays <HI>Dodwell,</HI> from the <HI>nativity</HI> of the philo&s;opher (he meant taking the word in that &s;en&s;e) to the death of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> brings us exactly to the time. Who can forbear &s;miling? A favourite notion is to many learned men a &s;acred thing. <HI>Dod|well</HI> &s;ettles his pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Antilochus</HI> to his mind, by perverting the word <HI>Elikia.</HI></P>
<P>This, to be &s;ure, in prophane things, can do no great harm: but when the practice is brought into things &s;acred, it is a detriment to mankind. Some divines, for example, to &s;upport a notion as unrea&s;on|able as it is dear to them, tell us that the word <HI>I&s;os</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>&s;trict equality,</HI> not <HI>like:</HI> and that when St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays <GAP DESC="foreign">, we mu&s;t con&s;true it, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>&s;trictly equal</HI> to the mo&s;t high God. This is &s;ad con|&s;truction, when <HI>Homer, Euripides, Ae&s;chylus,</HI> make the word <HI>I&s;os</HI> to import no more than <HI>like. I&s;anemos,</HI> &s;wift <HI>as</HI> the wind; <HI>I&s;atheos phos, like</HI> a God; <HI>I&s;anerios, like</HI> a dream.</P>
<P>And when a divine is po&s;itive that <HI>os</HI> and <HI>kathos, as,</HI> and <HI>even as,</HI> words occurring in the New Te&s;tament,
<PB N="268" REF="283">&s;ignify a <HI>&s;trict equality,</HI> and not <HI>&s;ome &s;ort of likene&s;s;</HI> this is mi&s;erable perver&s;ion, and hurts the chri&s;tian religion very greatly; as they endeavour, by &s;uch a <HI>given &s;en&s;e,</HI> to prove that the man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> is to be <HI>honoured</HI> with the <HI>&s;ame divine honours</HI> we offer to <HI>God the Father Almighty,</HI> by the <HI>command</HI> and <HI>example</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who was <HI>&s;ent from God,</HI> and was a <HI>wor&s;hipper of God;</HI> who lived <HI>obedient</HI> to the <HI>laws</HI> of <HI>God, preached tho&s;e laws,</HI> and <HI>died</HI> for them in the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> who was <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> from the <HI>dead by God,</HI> and now fits on <HI>God's right hand; intercedes</HI> with <HI>God,</HI> and in his Go&s;pel owns <HI>his Father</HI> to be <HI>his</HI> and <HI>our only true God.</HI> This is &s;ad accommodation. Tho' the words never &s;ignify more than a <HI>degree of likene&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Greek cla&s;&s;ics,</HI> yet our head&s;trong orthodox monks will have them to mean <HI>&s;trict equality;</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great and <HI>Alexander</HI> the Copper&s;mith are the &s;ame Being. Amazing! Gentlemen; here is but <HI>One Ball,</HI> and out of it&s;elf you &s;hall &s;ee this one ball &s;end forth two other balls, big as it, and yet not lo&s;e one atom of its weight and grandeur. <HI>Hocus pocus, Reverendi&s;&s;imi &s;pectatores,</HI> the <HI>One is Three.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Gentlemen, be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve the miracle rever&s;ed. <HI>Pilluli pilluli, congregate, Pre&s;to pre&s;io, unite: ob&s;ervate, Signori Dotti&s;&s;imi,</HI> the <HI>Three are One.</HI>&mdash; Such is the <HI>becus pocus</HI> the <HI>monks</HI> have made of their <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>

In an&s;wer to this, I replied, that if I had got her letter &s;ooner, I would have been with her long before: but that was not po&s;|&s;ible, as I had been at a little lodge and farm of mine in the northern extremity of <HI>We&s;t|moreland,</HI> to &s;ettle things there, and returned

<P>I told her I was a &s;tranger in the county, and by a wonderful accident, as I travelled a

While I was giving this &s;hort relation, Mi&s;s <HI>Spence</HI> &s;eemed greatly amazed, and her uncle, an old clergyman, who had looked with great attention at me, hoped it would be no offence to a&s;k me how old I was.</P>
<P>None at all, Sir, I replied. I want &s;ome months of twenty-&s;ix; and though I dance and rattle at the wells, and am now going up to <HI>London,</HI> where all is tumult and noi&s;e,
<PB N="269" REF="284">yet my pa&s;&s;ion for &s;till life is &s;o great, that I prefer the mo&s;t &s;ilent retreat to the plea&s;ures and &s;plendors of the greate&s;t town. If it was in my power to live as I plea&s;e, I would pa&s;s my days unheard of and unknown, at <HI>Orton-Lodge,</HI> &s;o my little &s;ilent farm is called, near the &s;outhern confines of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> with &s;ome bright partner of my &s;oul.

<P>But tell me, I reque&s;t, <HI>Maria</HI> &s;aid, how did you get to the confines of <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> over <HI>Stanemore</HI> hills, and what was that ac|cident that put you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Orton-Lodge?</HI> It mu&s;t be a curious account, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>This, I replied, you &s;hall hear to-morrow morning after breakfa&s;t; there is not time for it now. All I can &s;ay at pre&s;ent is, that it was love kept me among the mountains for &s;ome years, and if the heaven-born maid (va&s;tly like you, Mi&s;s <HI>Spence,</HI> &s;he was) had not, by the order of heaven, been removed to the regions of immortality and day, I &s;hould not have left the &s;olitude, nor would you ever have left the &s;olitude, nor would you ever have &s;een me at <HI>Harrogate:</HI> but de|&s;tiny is the dirigent: mutable is the condition of mortals, and we are blind to futurity and the approaches of fate. This led me over the va&s;t mountains of <HI>Stanemore,</HI> enabled me
<PB N="270" REF="285">to cro&s;s the amazing fells of <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and brought me to that &s;pot, where I had the honour and happine&s;s of becoming ac|quainted with Mi&s;s <HI>Spence.</HI> Thus did we chat till eleven, and retired to our chambers.</P>
<P>But the old gentleman, the doctor, when he came with me into my apartment, told me we mu&s;t have one bottle more, for it was his nightcap, without which he could not &s;leep: he then bid the &s;ervant make ha&s;te with it, and when that was out, we had another. He was a &s;en&s;ible agreeable man, and plea&s;ed me very much, as he appeared a zealous friend to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover;</HI> whereas almo&s;t all the clergymen I had been in company with &s;ince I came to <HI>England,</HI> were Jacobites, and very violent ones.</P>

<P><PB N="271" REF="286">
To this the doctor replied, that the exclu|&s;ion of a popi&s;h prince mu&s;t be lawful, if we ought to &s;ecure our property and religion, and, as in duty bound, oppo&s;e his trampling upon the laws, and his own &s;olemn declarations. If the people have privileges and intere&s;ts, they may defend them, and as ju&s;tifiably op|po&s;e notorious dome&s;tic oppre&s;&s;ions, as foreign inva&s;ions. The head of the community, has no more a licence to de&s;troy the mo&s;t mo|mentous intere&s;ts of it, than any of the infe|rior members, or than any foreign invader. If a king has no pa&s;&s;ion to indulge, incom|patible with the welfare of his people, then, as protection and obedience are reciprocal, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the one without the other, it mu&s;t be a crime in the people not to ho|nour, and obey, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the royal autho|rity. It is not only the intere&s;t but the duty of the &s;ubject to obey the prince, who is true to the important tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and has the welfare of the people at heart. But &s;uch a king cannot be a papi&s;t. The Romi&s;h prince will not only &s;tretch a limited preroga|tive into lawle&s;s power, and gra&s;p at ab&s;olute monarchy; but will break through the mo&s;t &s;acred ties, and &s;ubvert the rights he was &s;worn to guard, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>popery</HI> in this kingdom. Could <HI>James</HI> the Second have kept the &s;eat of government, and baffled all oppo&s;ition, we may conclude from what he
<PB N="272" REF="287">did, from his trampling upon the laws, and his own &s;olemn declarations; from his new court of <HI>inqui&s;ition</HI> (the high commi&s;&s;ion court) to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the church of <HI>England,</HI> and to lay wa&s;te all its fences again&s;t popery; from that furious act of his power, which fell on <HI>Magdalen-college,</HI> and his <HI>two cruel acts of parliament</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> (<HI>repeal of the act of &s;ettlement,</HI> by which the prote&s;tant gentlemen were deprived of their e&s;tates; and the <HI>act of attainder,</HI> by which they were to be hanged, for going to beg their bread in another country, after they had been robbed of all in their own by their king, who had &s;worn to protect them); from hence, I &s;ay, it is plain, that if <HI>James</HI> could have &s;at firm upon the throne, his mi&s;guided con|&s;cience would have induced him to the mo&s;t inhuman acts of violence. He would have proceeded to the barbarities; and rekindled the flames of <HI>Mary.</HI> Had he continued to reign over the&s;e kingdoms, it is mo&s;t certain, that in&s;truction and per&s;ua&s;ion only would not have been the thing, but where in&s;truc|tion and per&s;ua&s;ion failed, impri&s;onments, tortures, death, would have been u&s;ed, to compel us to believe all the <HI>gro&s;s ab&s;urdities</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> their <HI>impieties</HI> go <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>contra|dictions</HI> to <HI>common &s;en&s;e.</HI> We mu&s;t throw away our rea&s;on and our bibles, the noble&s;t gifts of heaven, and neither think nor &s;peak,
<PB N="273" REF="288">but as we are bid by men no wi&s;er than our|&s;elves; or, we mu&s;t expire under torments as great as the devil and the monks could de|vi&s;e. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary, for the pre|&s;ervation of our church and &s;tate, to exclude <HI>James</HI> and his popi&s;h heirs. The common welfare required this &s;alutary precaution. The collected intere&s;t of the community is the pri|mary end of every law.</P>
<P>All this, I &s;aid, &s;eems quite right. To be &s;ure, during that &s;hort twilight of power, which dawned upon <HI>popery</HI> in <HI>England</HI> in the years 1689 and 90, its rage was imprudent. It did di&s;cover its fury and re&s;entment. In one of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> acts you have mentioned, more than 2000 people were attainted, and &s;ome of them the mo&s;t noble and venerable cha|racters in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Yet had &s;ucce&s;s attended the arms of <HI>James,</HI> this would have been but the beginning of &s;orrows. And probably a &s;on of chri&s;tian <HI>Rome</HI> would have pro&s;cribed more in the&s;e two i&s;lands, than in heathen <HI>Rome,</HI> out of the whole va&s;t <HI>Roman</HI> empire, were given up to de&s;truction for their virtue, by the cruel triumvirate, <HI>Augu&s;tus, Antony,</HI> and <HI>Lepidus:</HI> And of con&s;equence, &s;ince dear experience convinced, it was equally ab&s;urd and vain, to imagine that a popi&s;h head would govern a prote&s;tant church by any councils, but tho&s;e of <HI>popi&s;h prie&s;ts,</HI> as it was to imagine that a popi&s;h king
<PB N="274" REF="289">would govern a prote&s;tant &s;tate by any councils, but tho&s;e of <HI>popi&s;h coun&s;ellors;</HI> it mu&s;t therefore be owned, that the Lords, and others, a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> were ju&s;t in declaring, <HI>that King James's admini|&s;trations were u&s;urpations on the con&s;titution; and that they owned it rebellion to re&s;i&s;t a king that governed by law; but to re&s;i&s;t a tyrant, who made his will his law, was nothing but a nece&s;&s;ary defence.</HI> This, to be &s;ure, is ju&s;t. But &s;till, if crowns are hereditary, and one &s;evere puni&s;hment of trea&s;on was intended to check all rebellion, were we not a little too ha&s;ty in the affair of the Revolution? And might we not have expected &s;omething better from the good &s;en&s;e and good nature of <HI>James,</HI> if we had waited a while, till he could &s;ee the folly of his proceedings?</P>
<P>To this the Doctor replied, that as to <HI>James</HI>'s good &s;en&s;e, it never appeared he had any: and in re&s;pect of his many real good qualities, they were extingui&s;hed by his bi|gotry, and could never be of &s;ervice to a prote&s;tant &s;pirit, the &s;pirit of freemen: it was therefore incumbent on them, who knew and loved the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings they en|joyed, to act as they did; that is, as the wi&s;dom of our con&s;titution requires in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>As to the crown's being hereditary,&mdash;and the &s;evere puni&s;hment of trea&s;ons; &mdash; in re|&s;pect
<PB N="275" REF="290">of the fir&s;t particular, there is no na|tural or divine law declares crowns heredi|tary. If a certain rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in mo&s;t kingdoms, the &s;ingle point of view in it was public good, or a prevention of tho&s;e inte&s;tine commotions, which might attend an election: But as every rule is di&s;pen&s;ible, and mu&s;t give way when it defeats the end for which it was ap|pointed; &s;hould the cu&s;tomary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in a kingdom prove at any time productive of much greater evils than tho&s;e it was intended to obviate, it may que&s;tionle&s;s be &s;uper&s;eded occa&s;ionally. This point is evident from rea|&s;on. Though the crown in our own country is generally hereditary, yet that right is to be &s;et a&s;ide, if the &s;ecurity of our civil and religious liberty requires it. If the <HI>pretence</HI> of <HI>James</HI> was a right to <HI>dominion,</HI> in oppo&s;i|tion not only to the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>legi&s;lature,</HI> but to that of the nation, then the <HI>popi&s;h prince was ju&s;tly excluded,</HI> for denying the public good to be the &s;upreme law. Had the right he claimed been e&s;tabli&s;hed, then our religion, our liberties, and the &s;afety of our fortunes, had been no longer our own. In ca&s;e of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, the glory of our con&s;titution was no more. The &s;um of the matter is, the royal family of the <HI>Steuarts</HI> being <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> makes their ca&s;e &s;imi|lar to an extinction of it.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="291">
And as to the accumulated puni&s;hment of trea&s;on in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that can only be de&s;igned as a powerful check to rebellion, again&s;t a king who&s;e darling view is the welfare of the people. No infamy, for|feitures, or death, can be too &s;evere for the man, who rebels again&s;t a prince that go|verns for the good of the people, and en|deavours to tran&s;mit our &s;tate &s;afe to po&s;te|rity. To plot again&s;t &s;uch a &s;overeign is a great crime indeed. To con&s;pire again&s;t a prince, who&s;e life is of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence to the community, is an enormity that ought to be &s;tamped with a peculiar in|famy, and puni&s;hed in the &s;evere&s;t manner. But it can be no trea&s;on to act again&s;t a <HI>papi&s;t,</HI> who violates every maxim of our con&s;titution, and by every maxim of popery labours to de&s;troy our religion and liberties. Every man may repel unlawful attempts upon his per&s;on and property, and is armed by God with authority for &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>To this it was replied, that I thought the Doctor quite right, and for my own part was determined to oppo&s;e a <HI>popi&s;h prince,</HI> whenever he comes on with his <HI>unalienable</HI> and <HI>indefea&s;ible</HI> claim, to introduce his <HI>ab&s;urd and cruel religion,</HI> to deprive us of our <HI>rational chri&s;tianity,</HI> and make us <HI>&s;laves,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>free-born &s;ubjects.</HI> No <HI>popi&s;h James,</HI> to write our themes, but (filling a bumper) may this

Here we got &s;ome bacon and fre&s;h egges for &s;upper, and the ale was good, which amu&s;ed us well enough till nine o'clock.

<PB N="284" REF="299">of cards; but they had none in the hou&s;e, and we were obliged to divert our&s;elves with conver&s;ation, till it was time to retire. Mi&s;s <HI>Spence</HI> began in the following manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A di&s;|cour&s;e on fluxions.</NOTE>Was <HI>Newton,</HI> Sir, or <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> the author of that method of calculation, which lends its aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to all the other mathe|matical &s;ciences, and that in their greate&s;t wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es? I have heard a foreigner affirm, that the <HI>German</HI> was the inventor of fluxions.</P>
<P>That cannot be (I replied). In the year 1696, Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> received from Mr. <HI>New|ton</HI> a demon&s;tration of the rule of the <HI>qua|drature of curves,</HI> which the Doctor com|municated to Mr. <HI>Collins;</HI> and as this is the foundation of <HI>fluxions,</HI> and the <HI>differential calculus,</HI> it is evident Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> had in|vented the method before that time.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1673, <HI>Leibnitz</HI> was in <HI>England,</HI> again in <HI>October</HI> 1676; and the interval of this time he &s;pent in <HI>France,</HI> during which he kept a corre&s;pondence with <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> and by his means with <HI>J. Col|lins;</HI> and &s;ometimes al&s;o with <HI>Newton,</HI> from the la&s;t of whom he received a letter, dated <HI>June</HI> 18, 1676, wherein is taught the me|thod of reducing quantities into infinite &s;e|ries, that is, of exhibiting the increments of flowing quantities. This method was utterly
<PB N="285" REF="300">unknown to <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> before he received the above&s;aid letter of <HI>Newton</HI>'s, as he him&s;elf acknowledges in a letter to <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> dated <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 27, 1676; for before that time, he &s;ays in his letter, he was obliged to trans|form an irrational quantity into a rational fraction, and then by divi&s;ion, after the me|thod of <HI>Mercator,</HI> to reduce the fraction into a &s;eries.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e certain, that <HI>Leibnitz</HI> did not then under&s;tand the&s;e &s;eries, becau&s;e, in the &s;ame letter, he de&s;ires <HI>Newton</HI> would ex|plain to him the manner how he got the&s;e &s;eries. And again in a &s;econd letter from <HI>Newton</HI> to <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> 24, 1676, he gives yet clearer hints of his method, and illu&s;trates it by examples, and lays down a rule, by which, from the ordinates of certain curves, their areas may be obtained in finite terms, when it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>By the&s;e lights, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch ex|amples, the acute <HI>Leibnitz</HI> might have learn|ed the <HI>Newtonian</HI> method.</P>
<P>It is plain he did &s;o; for in 1684, he fir&s;t publi&s;hed, in the <HI>Leip&s;ic Acts,</HI> his <HI>Elements of the Differential Calculus,</HI> without pretend|ing to have had the method before the year 1677, the year he received the two letters from <HI>Newton:</HI> and yet, when Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> pub|li&s;hed his books of the number of curves of the fir&s;t kind, and of the quadrature of fi|gures,
<PB N="296" REF="301">the editors of the <HI>Acts</HI> &s;aid <HI>Leibnitz</HI> was the fir&s;t inventor of the <HI>differential cal|culus,</HI> and <HI>Newton</HI> had &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>fluxions</HI> for <HI>differences,</HI> ju&s;t as <HI>Honoratus Faber,</HI> in his <HI>Synop&s;is Geometrica,</HI> had &s;ub&s;tituted a pro|gre&s;&s;ion of motion for <HI>Cavallerius</HI>'s method of indivi&s;ibles; that is, <HI>Leibnitz</HI> was the fir&s;t inventor of the method, <HI>Newton</HI> had received it from him (from his <HI>Elements of the Diffe|rential Calculus),</HI> and had &s;ub&s;tituted <HI>fluxions</HI> for <HI>differences;</HI> but the way of inve&s;tigation in each is the &s;ame, and both center in the &s;ame conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>This excited Mr. <HI>Keil</HI> to reply; and he made it appear very plain from Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s letters, publi&s;hed by Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> that he <HI>(Newton)</HI> was the fir&s;t inventor of the al|gorith, or practical rules of fluxions; and <HI>Leibnitz</HI> did no more than publi&s;h the &s;ame, with an alteration of the name, and manner of notation. This however did not &s;ilence <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> nor &s;atisfy the foreigners who ad|mired him. He abu&s;ed Dr. <HI>Keil,</HI> and ap|pealed to the Royal Society again&s;t him; that they would be plea&s;ed to re&s;train the Doc|tor's vain babblings and unju&s;t calumniations, and report their judgment as he thought they ought to do, that is, in his favour. But this was not in the power of the Society, if they did ju&s;tice; for it appeared quite clear to a committee of the members, appointed
<PB N="287" REF="302">to examine the original letters, and other papers, relating to the matter, which were left by Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> and Mr. <HI>J. Collins,</HI> that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>inventor</HI> of <HI>fluxions;</HI> and accordingly they publi&s;hed their opinion. This determines the affair. When this is the ca&s;e, it is &s;en&s;ele&s;s for any foreigner to &s;ay <HI>Leibnitz</HI> was the author of fluxions. To the divine <HI>Newton</HI> belongs this greate&s;t work of genius, and the noble&s;t thought that ever entered the human mind.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be &s;o (<HI>Maria</HI> replied): As the ca&s;e is &s;tated, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> was mo&s;t certainly the inventor of the method of fluxions: And &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Leibnitz</HI> had been able to di&s;cover and work the <HI>differential cal|culus,</HI> without the lights he received from <HI>Newton,</HI> it would not from thence follow, that he under&s;tood the true method of <HI>fluxions:</HI> for, though a <HI>differential</HI> has been, and to this day is, by many, called a <HI>fluxion,</HI> and a <HI>fluxion</HI> a <HI>differential,</HI> yet it is an abu&s;e of terms. A <HI>fluxion</HI> has no relation to a <HI>diffe|rential,</HI> nor a <HI>differential</HI> to a <HI>fluxion,</HI> The principles upon which the methods are founded &s;hew them to be very different; notwith&s;tanding the way of inve&s;tigation in each be the &s;ame, and that both center in the &s;ame conclu&s;ions: nor can the <HI>differen|tial</HI> method perform what the <HI>fluxionary</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="303">method can. The excellency of the <HI>fluxion|ary</HI> method is far above the <HI>differential.</HI></P>
<P>This remark on the two methods &s;ur|prized me very much, and e&s;pecially as it was made by a young lady. I had not then a notion of the difference, and had been taught by my ma&s;ter to proceed on the prin|ciples of the <HI>Differential Calculus.</HI> This made me reque&s;t an explication of the mat|ter, and <HI>Maria</HI> went on in the following manner.</P>
<P>Magnitudes, as made up of an infinite number of very &s;mall con&s;tituent parts put together, are the work of the <HI>Differential Calculus;</HI> but by the <HI>fluxionary</HI> method, we are taught to con&s;ider magnitudes as generated by motion. A de&s;cribed line in this way, is not generated by an <HI>appo&s;ition</HI> of points, or <HI>differ|entials,</HI> but by the <HI>motion</HI> or <HI>flux</HI> of a point; and the velocity of the generating point in the fir&s;t moment of its formation, or ge|neration, is called its fluxion. In forming magnitudes after the <HI>differential</HI> way, we conceive them as made up of an infinite num|ber of &s;mall con&s;tituent parts, &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to produce a magnitude of a given form; that the&s;e parts are to each other as the mag|nitudes of which they are <HI>differentials;</HI> and that one infinitely &s;mall part, or <HI>differential,</HI> mu&s;t be infinitely great, with re&s;pect to an|other
<PB N="289" REF="304">other <HI>differential,</HI> or infinitely &s;mall part: but by <HI>fluxion,</HI> or the law of <HI>flowing,</HI> we deter|mine the proportion of magnitudes one to another, from the celerities of the motions by which they are generated. This mo&s;t certainly is the pure&s;t ab&s;tracted way of rea|&s;oning. Our con&s;idering the different de|grees of magnitude, as ari&s;ing from an in|crea&s;ing &s;eries of mutations of velocity, is much more &s;imple, and le&s;s perplexed than the other way; and the operations founded on <HI>fluxions,</HI> mu&s;t be much more clear, accu|rate, and convincing, than tho&s;e that are founded on the <HI>Differential Calculus.</HI> There is a great difference in operations, when quan|tities are rejected, becau&s;e they really vani&s;h; &mdash;and when they are rejected, becau&s;e they are infinitely &s;mall: the latter method, which is the <HI>differential,</HI> mu&s;t leave the mind in ambiguity and confu&s;ion, and cannot in many ca&s;es come up to the truth. It is a very great error then to call <HI>differentials, flux|ions,</HI> and quite wrong to begin with the <HI>dif|ferential</HI> method, in order to learn the law or manner of <HI>flowing.</HI></P>
<P>With amazement I heard his di&s;cour&s;e, and reque&s;ted to know by what ma&s;ter, and what method, &s;he obtained the&s;e notions; for they were far beyond every thing on the &s;ub|ject that I had ever met with. What &s;he &s;aid concerning the nature and idea of <HI>flux|ions,</HI>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An ac|count of <HI>Martin Murdoch.</HI></NOTE>My ma&s;ter, Sir, (<HI>Maria</HI> an&s;wered) was a poor traveller, a Scotchman, one <HI>Martin Murdoch,</HI> who came by accident to my father's hou&s;e, to a&s;k relief, when I was about fifteen years old. He told us, he was the &s;on of one&punc; of the mini&s;ters of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and came from the re|mote&s;t part of the Highlands: that his father taught him mathematics, and left him, at his death, a little &s;tock on a &s;mall farm; but misfortunes and accidents obliged him in a &s;hort time to break up hou&s;e, and he was go|ing to <HI>London,</HI> to try if he could get any thing there, by teaching arithmetic of every kind. My father, who was a ho&s;pita|ble man, invited him to &s;tay with us a few days, and the par&s;on of our pari&s;h &s;oon found, that he had not only a very extraordinary un|der&s;tanding, but was particularly excellent at figures, and the other branches of the ma|thematics. My father upon this agreed with him to be my preceptor for five years, and during four years and nine months of that time, he took the greate&s;t pains to make me as perfect as he could in arithmetic, tri|gonometry, geometry, algebra, and fluxions. As I delighted in the &s;tudy above all things, I was a great proficient for &s;o few years, and had <HI>Murdoch</HI> been longer with me, I &s;hould
<PB N="291" REF="306">have been well acquainted with the whole glorious &s;tructure: but towards the end of the fifth year, this poor <HI>Archimedes</HI> was un|fortunately drowned, in cro&s;&s;ing one of our rivers, in the winter time, and went in that uncomfortable way, in the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age, to the enjoyment of that felicity and glory, which God has prepared for a virtuous life and hone&s;t heart. Why &s;uch men, as the poor and admirable <HI>Murdoch,</HI> have often &s;uch hard mea&s;ure in this world, is not in my power to account for; nor do I believe any one can: but what I tell you is one of tho&s;e &s;urprizing things, and I la|mented not a little the lo&s;s of &s;uch a ma&s;ter. Still however I continued to &s;tudy by many written rules he had given me, and to this day, mathematics are the greate&s;t plea&s;ure of my life.</P>
<P>As to our method, my ma&s;ter, in the fir&s;t place, made me perfectly under&s;tand arith|metic, and then geometry and algebra, in all their parts and improvements, the methods of &s;eries, doctrine of proportions, nature of loga|rithms, mechanics, and laws of motion: from thence we proceeded to the pure doctrine of <HI>fluxions,</HI> and at la&s;t looked into the <HI>Differential Calculus.</HI> In this true way my excellent ma&s;ter led me, and in the &s;ame difficult path every one mu&s;t go, who intends to learn <HI>Fluxions.</HI> I would be but lo&s;t labour for any per&s;on to

<P>When we turned to <HI>fluxions,</HI> the fir&s;t thing my ma&s;ter did, was to in&s;truct me in the arithmetic of <HI>exponents,</HI> the nature of powers, and the manner of their generation. We went next to the doctrine of infinite &s;eries; and then, to the manner of generating <HI>ma|thematical quantities.</HI> This generation of quantities was my fir&s;t &s;tep into <HI>fluxions,</HI> and my ma&s;ter &s;o amply explained the nature of them, in this operation, that I was able to form a <HI>ju&s;t idea</HI> of a <HI>fir&s;t fluxion,</HI> though thought by many to be <HI>incomprehen&s;ible.</HI> We proceeded from thence to the <HI>notation</HI> and <HI>algorithm</HI> of <HI>fir&s;t fluxions;</HI> to the finding &s;econd, third, <HI>&amp;c. fluxions;</HI> the finding <HI>flux|ions</HI> of <HI>exponential quantities;</HI> and the <HI>fluents</HI> from given <HI>fluxions;</HI> to their u&s;es in drawing <HI>tangents</HI> to <HI>curves;</HI> in finding the <HI>areas</HI> of <HI>&s;paces;</HI> the <HI>valves</HI> of <HI>&s;urfaces;</HI> and the <HI>contents</HI> of <HI>&s;olids;</HI> their <HI>percu&s;&s;ion, o&s;cillation,</HI> and <HI>centers of gravity.</HI> All the&s;e things my ma&s;ter &s;o happily explained to my under&s;tanding, that I was able to work with ea&s;e, and found no more difficulty in conceiving an adequate notion of a <HI>na&s;cent</HI> or <HI>evane&s;cent quantity,</HI> than in forming a true idea of a <HI>mathematical point.</HI> In &s;hort, by the time I had &s;tudied fluxions two years, I not only under&s;tood their fun|damental principles and operations, and could inve&s;tigate, and give the &s;olution of the mo&s;t

A velocity or fluxion is at be&s;t we do not know what;&mdash;whether &s;omething or nothing: and how can the mind lay hold on, or form any accurate ab&s;tract idea of &s;uch a &s;ubtile, fleeting thing?</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="310">
Di&s;putants (<HI>Maria</HI> an&s;wered) may perplex with deep &s;peculations, and confound with my&s;terious di&s;qui&s;itions, but the method of fluxions has no dependance on &s;uch things. The operation is not what any &s;ingle ab&s;tract velocity can generate or de&s;cribe of it&s;elf, but what a continual and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively variable velocity can produce in the whole: And certainly, a variable cau&s;e may produce a variable effect, as well as a permanent cau&s;e a permanent and con&s;tant effect. The dif|ference can only be, that the continual vari|ation of the effect mu&s;t be proportional to the continual variation of the cau&s;e. The method of <HI>fluxions</HI> therefore is true, whether we can or cannot conceive the nature and manner of &s;everal things relating to them, though we had no ideas of perpetually ari&s;ing increments, and magnitudes in na&s;cent or eva|ne&s;cent &s;tates. The knowledge of &s;uch things is not e&s;&s;ential to fluxions. All they propo&s;e is, <HI>to determine the velocity or flowing where|with a generated quantity increa&s;es, and to &s;um up all that has been generated or de&s;cribed by the continually variable fluxion.</HI> On the&s;e two ba&s;es fluxions &s;tand.</P>
<P>This was clear and ju&s;t, and &s;hewed that the nature and idea of <HI>fluxions</HI> is agreeable to the nature and con&s;titution of things. They can have no dependance upon any <HI>metaphy|&s;ical &s;peculations,</HI> (&s;uch &s;peculations as that
<PB N="296" REF="311"><HI>anti-mathematician,</HI> my Lord of <HI>Cloyne,</HI> brought in, to cavil and di&s;pute again&s;t principles he under&s;tood nothing of, and <HI>maliciou&s;ly</HI> run the account of them into the dark;) but are the genuine offspring of nature and truth. An in&s;tance or two may illu&s;trate the matter.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A heavy body de&s;cends perpendicularly 16 1/12 feet in a &s;econd, and at the end of this time, has acquired a velocity of 32&frac16; feet in a &s;econd, which is accurately known. At any given di&s;tance then from the place the body fell, take the point A in the right line, and the velocity of the falling body in the point may be truly computed: but the velo|city in any point above A, at ever &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance, will be le&s;s than in A; and the ve|locity at any point below A, at the lea&s;t po&s;|&s;ible di&s;tance, will be greater than in A. It is therefore plain, that in the point A, the body has a certain determined velocity, which belongs to no other point in the whole line. Now this velocity is the fluxion of that right line in the point A; and with it the body would proceed, if gravity acted no longer on the body's arrival at A.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Take a gla&s;s tube open at both ends, who&s;e concavity is of different diameters in different places, and immer&s;e it in a &s;tream, till the water fills the tube, and flows through it. Then, in different parts of the tube, the velocity of the water will be as the &s;quares
<PB N="297" REF="312">of the diameters, and of con&s;equence dif|ferent. Suppo&s;e then, in any marked place, a plane to pa&s;s through the tube perpendicular to the axis, or to the motion of the water, and of con&s;equence, the water will pa&s;s through this &s;ection with a certain determi|nate velocity: But if another &s;ection be drawn ever &s;o near the former, the water, by rea&s;on of the different diameters, will flow through this with a velocity different from what it did at the former, and therefore to one &s;ection of the tube, or &s;ingle point only, the deter|minate velocity belongs. It is the fluxion of the &s;pace which the fluid de&s;cribes at that &s;ec|tion; and with that uniform velocity the fluid would continue to move, if the diameter was the &s;ame to the end of the tube.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If a hollow cylinder be filled with wa|ter, to flow freely out through a hole at the bottom, the velocity of the effluent will be as the height of the water, and &s;ince the &s;ur|face of the incubent fluid de&s;cends without &s;top, the velocity of the &s;tream will decrea&s;e, till the effluent be all out. There can then be no two moments of time, &s;ucceeding each other ever &s;o nearly, wherein the velocity of the water is the &s;ame; and of con&s;equence, the velocity, at any given point, belongs only to that particular indivi&s;ible moment of time. Now this is accurately the fluxion of the fluid then flowing; and if, at that in&s;tant, more
<PB N="298" REF="313">water was poured into the cylinder, to make the &s;urface keep its place, the effluent would retain its velocity, and &s;till be the fluxion of the fluid. Such are the operations of na|ture, and they vi&s;ibly confirm the nature of <HI>Fluxion.</HI> It is from hence quite clear, that the <HI>fluxion</HI> of a <HI>generated quantity,</HI> cannot re|tain any one determined value for the lea&s;t &s;pace of time whatever, but the moment it arrives at that value, the &s;ame moment it lo&s;es it again. The <HI>fluxion</HI> of &s;uch quantity can only pa&s;s gradually and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively thro' the indefinite degrees contained between the two extreme values, which are the limits thereof, during the generation of the fluent, in ca&s;e the fluxion be variable: But then, though a determinate degree of fluxion does not continue at all, yet, at every determinate indivi&s;ible moment of time, every fluent has &s;ome determinate degree of fluxion; that is, every <HI>generated quantity</HI> has every where a cer|tain <HI>rate</HI> of increa&s;ing, a <HI>fluxion</HI> who&s;e ab&s;tract value is determinate in it&s;elf, though the <HI>fluxion</HI> has no determined value for the lea&s;t &s;pace of time whatever. To find its value then, that is, the <HI>ratio</HI> one fluxion has to an|other, is a <HI>problem &s;trictly geometrical;</HI> not|with&s;tanding the Right Rev. anti-mathema|tician has declared the contrary, in his hatred to mathematicians, and his ignorance of the true principles of mathematics.</ITEM>

<P>But Dr. <HI>Berkley</HI> was unacquainted with mathematical principles, and out of his aver|&s;ion to the&s;e &s;ciences, and zeal for orthodoxy, cavilled and di&s;puted with all his might, and endeavoured to bring the matter to a &s;tate unintelligible to him&s;elf, and every body el&s;e. &mdash;Here <HI>Maria</HI> had done, and for near a quar|ter of an hour after, I &s;at &s;ilently looking at her, in the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>

This young lady was &s;eized with that fatal di&s;temper, called a <HI>malignant fever:</HI> Something <HI>foreign</HI> to <HI>nature</HI> got into her blood, by a cold, and other accidents, it may be, and the <HI>luctus</HI> or &s;trife to get clear thereof became very great. The efferve&s;cence or per|turbation was very &s;oon &s;o violent as to &s;hew, that it not only endangered, but would quickly &s;ubvert the animal fabrick, unle&s;s the blood was &s;peedily di&s;per&s;ed, and nature got the victory by an exclu&s;ion of the noxious &s;hut|in particles. The thir&s;t, the dry tongue, the coming <HI>cau&s;us,</HI> were terrible, and gave me too much rea&s;on to apprehend this charming
<PB N="304" REF="319">woman would &s;ink under the conflict. To &s;ave her, if po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ent immediately for a great phy&s;ician, Dr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> a man who talked with great fluency of medicine and di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>This gentleman told me, the <HI>Alkaline</HI> was the root of fevers, as well as of other di&s;tem|pers, and therefore, to take off the efferve&s;|cence of the blood in the ebullitions of it, to incide the vi&s;cous humour, to drain the tartarous &s;alts from the kidnies, to allay the preternatural ferment, and to brace up the relaxed tones, he ordered orange and vinegar in whey, and pre&s;cribed &s;pirit of &s;ulphur, and vitriol, the cream, chry&s;tals, and vitriolate tartar in other vehicles. If any thing can relieve, it mu&s;t be plenty of acid. <HI>In acidis po&s;ita e&s;t omni curatio.</HI> But the&s;e things gave no relief to the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>I &s;ent then in all ha&s;te for Dr. <HI>Hough,</HI> a man of great reputation, and he differed &s;o much in opinion from <HI>Sharp,</HI> that he called an <HI>acid</HI> the <HI>chief enemy.</HI> It keeps up the <HI>luctus</HI> or &s;truggle, and if not expelled very quickly, will certainly prove fatal. Our &s;heet anchor then mu&s;t be the <HI>te&s;tacea,</HI> in vehicles of mineral water, and accordingly he ordered the <HI>ab&s;orbent powders</HI> to conflict with this <HI>acidity,</HI> the principal cau&s;e of all di&s;ea&s;es. <HI>Pearl</HI> and <HI>coral,</HI> crab's eyes, and crab's claws, he pre&s;cribed in diver&s;e forms;
<PB N="305" REF="320">but they were of no u&s;e to the &s;ick woman. She became wor&s;e every hour.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pym</HI> was next called in, a great practiti|oner, and learned man. His notion of a fever was quite different from the opinions of <HI>Sharp</HI> and <HI>Hough.</HI> He maintained that a <HI>fever</HI> was a <HI>poi|&s;onous ferment</HI> or <HI>venom,</HI> which &s;eized on the <HI>animal &s;pirits:</HI> it breaks and &s;mites them; and unle&s;s by <HI>alexipharmics</HI> the &s;pirits can be ena|bled to gain a victory in a day or two, this <HI>ferment</HI> will bring on what the <HI>Greeks</HI> call a <HI>&s;ynochus,</HI> that is, a continual fever. In that &s;tate, the <HI>venom</HI> holds fa&s;t the animal &s;pirits, will not let them expand, or di&s;engage them|&s;elves, and then they grow enraged, and tu|multuating, are hurried into a &s;tate of explo|&s;ion, and blow up the fabric. Hence the inflammatory fever, according to the diver&s;e <HI>indoles</HI> of the <HI>venom;</HI> and when the <HI>contagious mia&s;ms</HI> arrive at their highe&s;t degree, the <HI>ma|lignant fever</HI> ari&s;eth. The &s;pirits are then knocked down, and the marks of the enemies weapons, the &s;pots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> appear. This (the Doctor continued) is the ca&s;e of your lady, and therefore the thing to be done is, to make the <HI>malignant</HI> tack about to the mild, and produce an extinction of the ferment, and relief of the &s;ymptoms. This I endeavour to do by <HI>alexipharmics</HI> and <HI>ve&s;icatories,</HI> and by &s;ubduing the poi&s;on by the <HI>bark</HI> and the <HI>warmer antidotes.</HI> Thus did my Doctor mar|&s;hal
<PB N="306" REF="321">&s;hal his <HI>animal &s;pirits,</HI> fight them again&s;t the enemy <HI>venom,</HI> to great di&s;advantage. If his talk was not romance, it was plain his <HI>&s;pirits</HI> were routed, and <HI>venom</HI> was getting the day. His <HI>alexipharmics</HI> and <HI>warm antidotes,</HI> were good for nothing. The malady encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, I &s;ent again in ha&s;te for a fourth doctor, a man of greater learn|ing than the other three, and therefore, in opinion, oppo&s;ite, and again&s;t their manage|ment of the fever. This great man was Dr. <HI>Fro&s;t.</HI> He <HI>was</HI> a <HI>mechanician,</HI> and af|firmed that, the &s;olid parts of the human body are &s;ubjected to the rules of <HI>geometry,</HI> and the fluids to the <HI>hydro&s;tatics;</HI> and there|fore, to keep the <HI>machine</HI> in right order, that is, in a &s;tate of <HI>health,</HI> an <HI>aequilibrium</HI> mu&s;t be maintained, or re&s;tored, if de&s;troyed. The balance mu&s;t not turn to one &s;ide or the other. To re&s;tore <HI>&s;anity</HI> in acute ca&s;es, and in chronic too, our bu&s;ine&s;s is to prevent the ve&s;&s;els being elevated or depre&s;t beyond the <HI>&s;tandard of nature:</HI> when either happens, the divi&s;ion of the blood is increa&s;ed, the motion is augmented, and &s;o beget a fever. There cannot be an inordinate elevation of the oily or fiery parts of the blood, till the ve&s;&s;els vibrate above the <HI>&s;tandard of nature.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;light <HI>fever,</HI> the blood increa&s;es but little above the <HI>balance;</HI> but if more than one day; turns to a <HI>&s;ynochus,</HI> which is but the &s;ame
<PB N="307" REF="322">fever augmented beyond the <HI>balance of nature.</HI> This turns to a putrid <HI>&s;ynochus,</HI> and this to a <HI>cau&s;us.</HI> This is the ca&s;e of your lady. From an elevated contraction (the Doctor conti|tinued, to my amazement,) her blood obtains a greater force and motion; hence greater divi&s;ion, hence an increa&s;e of quantity and fluidity: and thus from greater divi&s;ion, mo|tion and quantity increa&s;ed, ari&s;es that heat and thir&s;t, with the other concomitant &s;ymp|toms of her fever; for the blood dividing fa&s;ter than it can be detached through the per&s;pirastory emunctories of the &s;kin, is the immediate cau&s;e of the heart's preternatural beating: And this preternatural divi&s;ion of the blood ari&s;es from the additional quantity of ob&s;tructed per&s;pirable matter, added to the natural quantity of the blood.</P>
<P>Things being &s;o, (the Doctor went on) and the fever ri&s;ing by the blood's dividing fa&s;ter than can be detached by the &s;everal emunc|tories; and this from an elevation of the <HI>&s;olids</HI> bove the <HI>balance,</HI> we mu&s;t then &s;trive to take off the ten&s;ion of the &s;olids, and &s;ubtract the cau&s;e. This makes me begin in a manner quite contrary to the other phy|&s;icians, and I doubt not but I &s;hall &s;oon get the better of the <HI>fury</HI> and <HI>orga&s;m,</HI> make an al|teration in the black &s;cabrous tongue, and by according with the <HI>modus of nature,</HI> throw forth the matter of the di&s;ea&s;e. I will ena|ble
<PB N="308" REF="323">nature to extricate her&s;elf. I hope to di&s;entangle her from the weight.</P>
<P>Thus did this very learned man enlarge; and while he talked of doing wonders, the dry and parched &s;kin, the black and bru&s;hy tongue, the cru&s;ty fur upon the teeth, and all the &s;ignals of an <HI>incendium</HI> within, de|clared her di&s;&s;olution very near. As the &s;erum dimini&s;hed fa&s;t, and the inte&s;tine motion of the <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum</HI> increa&s;ed, nature was brought to her la&s;t &s;truggles. All the di&s;mal harbin|gers of a general wreck appeared, to give the by-&s;tanders notice of approaching death. She died the ninth day, by the ignorance of four learned Phy&s;icians. &mdash; Had the&s;e Gentlemen confidered the <HI>fever</HI> no otherwi&s;e than as a <HI>di&s;|ea&s;e</HI> ari&s;ing from &s;ome unu&s;ual <HI>ferment,</HI> &s;tirred up among the humours of the blood, di&s;turb|ing both tho&s;e natural motions and functions of the body, hindering per&s;piration, and there|by giving quick and large acce&s;&s;ion to &s;uch parts of the aliment or liquors taken down, as are di&s;po&s;ed to ferment; and there is al|ways a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition that way; for the blood has a three-fold motion,&mdash;<HI>fluidity,</HI> com|mon to all liquors,&mdash;<HI>protru&s;ive,</HI> from the im|pul&s;e of the heart and arteries,&mdash;and <HI>fermen|tative,</HI> that is, a motion throughout of all its parts, which quality is owing to the di&s;&s;imi|lar parts of the blood; &mdash; for being a com|pound of various particles, there mu&s;t be a

<HEAD>MORAL THOUGHTS: <HI>Written by Mi&s;s</HI> SPENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MORALITY.</HEAD>
<P>ABSTRACT, mathematical, or phy&s;ical truth, may be above the reach of the bulk and community of mankind. They have neither the lei&s;ure, nor the nece&s;&s;ary helps and advantages to acquire the natural knowledge of arts and &s;ciences. The many calls and importunities of the animal kind, take up the greate&s;t part of their time, thoughts, and labor, &s;o that the more ab&s;tract &s;peculations, and experimental di&s;qui&s;itions of philo&s;ophy, are placed by providence quite out of their reach, and beyond their &s;phere of action.</P>
<P>On the contrary, <HI>moral truth,</HI> right and wrong, good and evil, the doing as we would be done by, and acting towards all men as they really are, and &s;tand related in &s;ociety; the&s;e things are as evident to the under&s;tand|ing, as light and colors are to the eye, and may be called the intellectual, moral &s;en&s;e. Here needs no deep learning, or trouble and ex|pence of education, but the &s;ame truths are as evident, and as much &s;een and felt by the learned and unlearned, the gentleman and
<PB N="312" REF="327">the ploughman, the &s;avage or wild <HI>Indian,</HI> as by the be&s;t in&s;tructed philo&s;opher. The divine perfections &s;hine through all nature, and the goodne&s;s and bounty of the Creator to all his creatures, impre&s;s the obligation of imitating this wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Beings upon every man's heart and con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the maxims of mora|lity are thus &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and adapted to all capacities; and though every man has a happine&s;s to &s;eek, and a main end to &s;ecure, which mu&s;t be infinitely preferable to any concerns of life, yet here it is we find, that mankind in general have been mo&s;t lo&s;t and bewildered, as if providence had placed their own happine&s;s, and the way to it, more out of their power than any thing el&s;e. How this &s;hould happen, might &s;eem unaccount|able at fir&s;t &s;ight, and yet it can be no'great my&s;tery to any man tolerably acquainted with the world and human nature. It is no diffi|cult matter to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons hereof, and it is withal highly u&s;eful to give them their due con&s;iderarion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The principal cau&s;e I take to be the pre|vailing &s;trength and bias of private, corrupt, animal affection, and de&s;ires. Rea&s;on is &s;ilenced and borne down by brutal appetite and pa&s;|&s;ion. They re&s;olve to gratify their &s;en&s;ual appetites and de&s;ires, and will therefore never ta&s;te or try the &s;uperior plea&s;ures and enjoy|ments
<PB N="313" REF="328">of rea&s;on and virtue. But &s;uch men as the&s;e having declared open war again&s;t their own rea&s;on and con&s;cience, and being re&s;olved at all ri&s;ks to maintain the combat, mu&s;t be &s;elf-condemned, and cannot plead ignorance, or error of judgment in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another fundamental cau&s;e of moral error, is the prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wrong education. Fal&s;e principles and ab|&s;urd notions of God and religion, wrought early into the tender, unexperienced mind, and there radicated and confirmed from time to time, from youth to riper age, by parents, teachers, our mo&s;t intimate friends and ac|quaintance, and &s;uch as we have the be&s;t opinion of, and confide mo&s;t in; &s;uch cau&s;es make &s;uch &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors, thus rivetted and fixed, are with the greate&s;t difficulty ever conquered or cleared off. In this ca&s;e, men turn out <HI>well-grounded believers,</HI> and are well-armed again&s;t convic|tion. Circumci&s;ion or bapti&s;m fixes their religion in their infancy, and their church is as natural to them as their country. Free enquiry is with them an apo&s;ta&s;y from the orthodox party, and as the great and &s;ure tryal of their faith and fortitude, they will hear no rea&s;onings about the holy religion they have taken upon tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Then the few, who have applied them|&s;elves to the &s;tudy of morality, have done it
<PB N="314" REF="329">for the mo&s;t part in a manner confu&s;ed; and &s;uperficial enough: and often &s;o, as even to build upon principles either entirely fal&s;e, or ob&s;cure and uncertain; either foreign to its proper bu&s;ine&s;s, or mixt up with gro&s;s errors, and ab&s;urdities. From whence it comes to pa&s;s, that in all languages, the terms of mo|rality, both in common di&s;cour&s;e, and in the writings of the learned, are &s;uch as have the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, confu&s;ed, indetermined, and unfixed ideas, of any other terms whatever; men for the mo&s;t part de&s;pi&s;ing the things which are plain and ordinary, to run after &s;uch as are extraordinary and my&s;terious; and that they either will not know, or reject even truth it&s;elf, unle&s;s &s;he brings &s;ome charm with her, to rai&s;e their curio&s;ity, and gratify their pa&s;&s;ion for what is marvellous and un|common.</P>
<P>In &s;um, the prejudices of the under&s;tand|ing, the illu&s;ions of the heart, and the ty|ranny e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world with relation to opinions, form a grand ob&s;tacle to the &s;e|rious &s;tudy of morality; and to the attain|ment of a more exact knowledge of our duty. Nor is it to be expected that any will very much apply them&s;elves to make di&s;coveries in the&s;e matters, whil&s;t the de&s;ire of e&s;teem, riches, or power, makes men e&s;pou&s;e the well-endowed opinions in fa&s;hion, and then &s;eek arguments either to make good
<PB N="315" REF="330">their beauty, or varni&s;h over and cover their deformity.&mdash;Whil&s;t the parties of men, cram their tenets down all men's throats, whom they can get into their power, without per|mitting them to examine their truth and fal&s;ehood; and will not let truth have fair play in the world, nor men the liberty to &s;earch after it; what improvements can be expected of this kind? What greater light can be hoped for in the moral &s;ciences? The &s;ubject part of mankind in mo&s;t places might, in&s;tead thereof, with <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage, ex|pect <HI>Egyptian</HI> darkne&s;s, were not the candle of the Lord &s;et up by him&s;elf in men's minds, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for the breath of man wholly to extingui&s;h; how much &s;oever the infallible guides of one church, and the or|thodox rulers of another, may &s;cheme and la|bour to &s;ubject con&s;cience to human juri&s;dic|tion, and bring the inward principle and mo|tive of action within the cognizance of their political theocracy, or theocratic policy.</P>
<P>After all this, is it to be wondered at, that &s;uch, who&s;e occupations and di&s;tractions of life, or want of genius and outward helps, do not allow them to engage in long and pro|found meditations, are found to have gene|rally under&s;tandings &s;o &s;hort and narrow, and ideas &s;o fal&s;e or confu&s;ed, in matters of mo|rality.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="331">
And &s;ince this is the ca&s;e of the greate&s;t part of mankind, it has no doubt been always God's will, that they, who had the greate&s;t light, and whom his providence had furni&s;hed with the greate&s;t helps, &s;hould communicate their knowledge to &s;uch, as were not able of them&s;elves to acquire it &s;o ea&s;ily, or in &s;o great a degree.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>What is Religion? The true, eternal, im|mutable religion of God and nature, con&s;i&s;ts, as I opine, in the filial love and fear of God, and the brotherly love of mankind; in the practice of all tho&s;e moral duties of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, which re&s;ult from it, under a fiducial tru&s;t in, and dependence on God, and the con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of his power and pre&s;ence in all our actions, as the rewarder of good and puni&s;her of bad men. This is the reli|gion founded in nature and rea&s;on, and which mu&s;t be at all times and every where the &s;ame. As this religion was in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t, and neglected, amid&s;t the general ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and idolatry of the world, it was the great bu&s;ine&s;s and de&s;ign of revelation to re&s;tore it, and &s;et moral truth and rea&s;on in its original light, by bringing mankind to
<PB N="317" REF="332">the right u&s;e of their rea&s;on and under&s;tand|ing in &s;uch matters.</P>
<P>After <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Zeno,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Eclec|tics.</HI></NOTE> there were no new &s;ucceeding &s;chemes of morality, but each man betook him&s;elf to that &s;ect, where he found what mo&s;t &s;uited his own &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>In the reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus, Potamo</HI> of <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> introduced a manner of philo&s;ophi&s;ing, which was called the <HI>Eclectic,</HI> becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ted in collecting from all the tenets of preceding philo&s;ophers, &s;uch as appeared mo&s;t rea&s;onable; out of which they formed each man his own &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy.&mdash;It ap|pears from <HI>Cicero</HI>'s works, that he was an <HI>Eclectic.</HI></P>
<P>And why &s;hould it not be good in religion, as well as in philo&s;ophy? I own I am an Eclectic <HI>in divinis.</HI> And the &s;um of my religion is, without regard to modes or par|ties,&mdash;&s;o to live to the glory of the Father,&mdash;without attachment to the creature,&mdash;for the &s;anctification and happine&s;s of mankind; that when this fleeting &s;cene of &s;in and &s;orrow &s;hall vani&s;h, and pa&s;s away from &s;ight, the angels of God may give my &s;oul a &s;afe tran&s;ition to that heavenly happine&s;s, which no thought can lay hold on, and which no art can de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="333">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of rea&s;on and truth.</NOTE>The practice of rea&s;on and truth is the rule of action to God him&s;elf, and the foun|dation of all true religion. It is the fir&s;t and highe&s;t obligation of all rational beings, and our divine Lord came down from heaven to earth to teach it to mankind. Chri&s;t preached a plain doctrine to men, fitted to reform their hearts and lives&mdash;intended to make them per|fect in &s;elf-denial, humility, love, goodne&s;s, and innocence; and to enoble them, with hearts rai&s;ed above the world, to wor&s;hip the <HI>Father</HI> in <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and in <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>But this glorious religion the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> prie&s;ts have perverted into a &s;y&s;tem of my&s;teries, and &s;taring contradictions, the better to &s;upport the wor&s;t and mo&s;t deplorable purpo&s;es of temporal wealth, power, pride, malice, and cruelty. In direct oppo&s;ition to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, we mu&s;t commence <HI>generous believers</HI> in an <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> chri&s;tianity, and confe&s;s the &s;ymbol of their holy <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> though it be no more, or better, than the ef|fects of a luxuriant fancy, without likene&s;s and corre&s;pondency, in the real nature and rea&s;on of things; 17, 4, and 19 are 41, &s;ays <HI>convocation</HI> to his <HI>believers,</HI> and your reli|gion, my brethren, is all a tremendous my|&s;tery: You mu&s;t adore as &s;uch, what the In|fidels renounce as a contradiction.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hamefully do the&s;e prie&s;ts &s;ink the credibility of our go&s;pel, and impo&s;e upon the
<PB N="319" REF="334">&s;illy people, a ball of wax for the religion of Je&s;us; making them believe contrary to knowledge, and prefer a &s;y&s;tem that is a lye again&s;t the light of nature, and the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But the chief end, duty, happine&s;s, and highe&s;t perfection that man can arrive at, con&s;i&s;ts, and is found, in a perfect exerci&s;e of <HI>human rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>We read in <HI>Chronicles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Inte|grity.</NOTE> that <HI>Hezekiah</HI> be|gan his <HI>good reign</HI> with the revival of reli|gion, which had long &s;uffered by the neg|lect and profanation, or through the neglect and omi&s;&s;ion of his predece&s;&s;ors. To this purpo&s;e he opened the doors of the hou&s;e of the Lord, and i&s;&s;ued a decree, that all I&s;rael &s;hould come to keep the pa&s;&s;over, which they had not done of a long time. But as the legal <HI>clean&s;ing</HI> and <HI>purifying,</HI> could not be performed by great numbers that did eat the pa&s;&s;over, by the appointed time, on account of many things, and particularly the force of long interval and di&s;u&s;e; there|fore this <HI>irregularity</HI> employed the devotion of the good king, as the canon of the pa&s;&s;|over, under the &s;tricte&s;t prohibition, and the &s;evere&s;t penalty, forbid any one to eat, that did not come with outward and legal purity, <HI>No unclean per&s;on &s;hall eat of it;</HI> and he prayed for the people, &s;aying, The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to &s;eek God,
<PB N="320" REF="335">the Lord God of their fathers, though he be not clean&s;ed according to the purification of the &s;anctuary; and the Lord hearkened unto <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> &s;ays the next ver&s;e, and <HI>healed the people,</HI> that is, took off the penalties of the <HI>canon,</HI> and gave them the benefit of the rite. From hence it follows, that, however defec|tive we may be in outward rites and cere|monies of a church, yet <HI>inward truth and purity</HI> will be accepted in default of outward things. <HI>Inward dispo&s;ition</HI> is the &s;ub&s;tance of religion, and may compound for the want of outward matters; but outward &s;ervice can never be accepted in&s;tead of inward pu|rification.</P>
<P>And it farther follows, if the outward &s;o|lemnities of religion cannot be obtained upon lawful terms, (which is the ca&s;e of many, in re&s;pect of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> wor&s;hip,) then will the good Lord pardon and be pro|pitious to tho&s;e who prepare their heart to &s;eek him, though they be not clean&s;ed ac|cording to the &s;olemn in&s;titution, and ritual purification.</P>
<P>This text is in the vulgar Latin, Dominus bonus propitiabitur cunctis qui in toto corde requirunt Dominum, Deum patrum &s;uorum, et non imputabit eis quod minus &s;anctificati &s;unt.&mdash;The good Lord will be propitious to all tho&s;e, who in their whole heart &s;eek the Lord God of their fathers, and will not im|pute

We are indebted to our &s;ta|tute-book for informing us of one of the mo&s;t notorious pieces of prie&s;tcraft that ever was practi&s;ed. Would one believe, that there is a country, and in <HI>Europe</HI> too, where the clergy gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the minds of the people, as tamely to &s;uffer the moveable e&s;tate of every man who died in|te&s;tate, to be &s;wallowed up by them; yet &s;o prevalent was &s;uper&s;tition in our country, that it produced a law preferring the Bi&s;hop to the next of kin; and in its exten&s;ion excluding the children, the wife, and the relations of the decea&s;ed, nay the creditor; and giving all to the Bi&s;hop <HI>per aver&s;ionem.</HI> Such was the &s;hameful rapacity of the clergy here for ages. Such a mon&s;trous practice was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon this foundation, that the move|able effects of every decea&s;ed per&s;on, his own appointment failing, ought to be laid out for promoting the good of his &s;oul; and &s;o the ORDINARY took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without deign|ing to account with any mortal.&mdash;This began
<PB N="322" REF="337"><HI>temp.</HI> Hen. I. when the ORDINARY, for the good of the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed, obtained a directing power, and was in the nature of an over&s;eer, and &s;omewhat more. In the time of King John, the ORDINARY <HI>drew blood,</HI> as <HI>Bacon</HI> well expre&s;&s;es it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Di&s;cour&s;e of laws. p. 1, and 66. and New a|bridge|ment of the law. p. 398.</NOTE>; for tho' the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was as formerly, yet the divi|dend mu&s;t be in the view of the church, and by which means, the dividers were but mere in&s;truments, and the right was vani&s;hed into the clouds. But <HI>temp.</HI> Hen. III. it was &s;ettled, the ORDINARY had not only gotten the game, but gorged it. Both right and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were now become the clergy's: the ORDINARY was to di&s;tribute it according to pious u&s;es: and no u&s;e &s;o pious as to appoint to him&s;elf and his brethren.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t &s;tatute that limited the power of the ORDINARY was 13th Ed. I. c. 19. By this the ORDINARY was obliged to &s;atisfy the inte&s;tate's death &s;o far as the goods ex|tended.&mdash;And 31&s;t Ed. III. cap. 2. the ac|tual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was taken from the ORDINA|RY, by obliging him to give a <HI>deputation</HI> to the next and mo&s;t lawful friends of the in|te&s;tate, for admini&s;trating his goods. But this &s;tatute proved but a weak check to the avarice of the clergy. Means were fallen upon to elude it, by preferring &s;uch of the inte&s;tate's relations, who were willing to offer the be&s;t terms: this corrupt practice was &s;uf|fered
<PB N="325" REF="338">in the days of Hen. VIII. when the clergy lo&s;ing ground, the &s;tatute 21 Hen. VIII. was enacted, bearing, "That in ca&s;e any per&s;on die inte&s;tate, or the executors re|fu&s;e to prove the te&s;tament, the <HI>Ordinary</HI> &s;hall grant admini&s;tration to the widow, or to the next of kin, or to both, taking &s;urety for true admini&s;tration."</P>
<P>This &s;tatute, as it points out the particular per&s;ons who are intitled to letters of admini|&s;tration, without leaving any choice to the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> was certainly intended to cut him out of all hope of making gain of the effects of per&s;ons dying inte&s;tate. But the church does not ea&s;ily quit its hold. Means were fallen upon to elude this law al&s;o. Though the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion given by this &s;tatute was wre&s;ted out of the hands of the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> yet his preten|&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ted intire, of calling the admini|&s;trator to account, and obliging him or her to di&s;tribute the effects to pious u&s;es.

<P><HI>Note</HI> 1. It is plain from what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays before, that the thing <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> is the better and more enduring &s;ub&s;tance in heaven.</P>

<P>In a word, the de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle was to prove that, &s;ince God has provided &s;ome better thing for us, we appear to be more in his favour; and therefore the argument from their being ju&s;tified to our being ju&s;tified by faith, is &s;tronger, that is, &s;uch a faith as has an operative influence, by rendering our lives a comment upon the ble&s;&s;ed nature of God.</P>
<P>And that this was the meaning of the Apo&s;tle in the <HI>&s;omething better</HI> provided for us Chri&s;tians, appears yet plainer from the con&s;equence drawn by the in&s;pired writer, to wit, that we ought with the greater pati|ence and courage to endure per&s;ecution, &s;ince God has provided &s;omething better for us
<PB N="329" REF="344">than for them.

<P>Let us lay a&s;ide (then) every weight, and the &s;in which doth &s;o ea&s;ily be&s;et us, and let us run with patience the race that is &s;et be|fore us.

<PB N="346" REF="361">to make it more u&s;eful than any other ink could be?</P>
<P>I will tell you (<HI>Ribble</HI> replied): you mu&s;t write with this lilach-coloured liquor, on good well gummed paper, that does not &s;ink; and the &s;ingularity of the ink, con&s;i&s;ts in its property of di&s;appearing entirely, and becoming invi|&s;ible, though it be not touched with any thing whatever: And this di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all others. The writing mu&s;t dry in a warm air, and while it is cold no colour can be perceived: but gently warming it before the fire, the writing gradually acquires a greeni&s;h blue colour, which is vi&s;ible as long as the paper continues a little warm, and di&s;appears entirely when it cools. When other &s;ympa|thetic inks are made to appear by proper application, they do not di&s;appear again; but this liquor from the ore of <HI>bi&s;muth</HI> mu&s;t have the fire or heat kept to it, to render it legi|ble. If a man writes to his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;e, or to a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, with lemon juice, once the writing has been warmed by the fire, and the letters by that means appear, the epi&s;tle may be afterwards read at any time and place; but if the lady's father &s;hould by accident get your letter, written in lilach-coloured liquor, it mu&s;t &s;till remain a &s;ecret to him: For if on getting it, and opening the &s;eal, he could &s;ee no writing, and therefore imagining it was writ with lemon juice, or
<PB N="347" REF="362">&s;ome other &s;ympathetic ink, he &s;hould hold it him&s;elf to the fire, or bid his &s;ervant hold it to the heat, that the letters might be pro|duced, and made vi&s;ible, yet the moment <HI>bi&s;muth-ink</HI> is taken away from the fire, and begins to cool, it is as invi&s;ible again, as a &s;heet of white paper.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cha|racters of gold.</NOTE><HI>Gold,</HI> our fir&s;t metal, has ten &s;en&s;ible cri|terions. It is the heavie&s;t and den&s;e&s;t of all bodies: the mo&s;t &s;imple of all bodies: the mo&s;t fixed of all bodies: the only body that cannot be turned into &s;coriae, by antimony and lead; the mo&s;t ductile of all bodies: &s;o &s;oft as to be &s;carcely ela&s;tic or &s;onorous: mu&s;t be red hot to melt: is di&s;&s;olvable by &s;ea-&s;alt and its preparations, but remains untouched by any other &s;pecies of &s;alts; and of con&s;equence not liable to ru&s;t; as <HI>aqua regia</HI> and &s;pirit of &s;ea-&s;alt do not float in the air, unle&s;s in labo|ratories; or chemi&s;ts &s;hops, where we find them &s;ometimes: It unites &s;pontaneou&s;ly with pure quick-&s;ilver: It never wa&s;tes by emitting <HI>effluvia,</HI> or exhalations. The&s;e are the ten &s;en&s;ible properties or characteri&s;tics of this metal. It is certainly pure gold, if it has the&s;e criterions, and they are of great u&s;e in life; e&s;pecially to per&s;ons who have to do with that &s;ubtil tribe, the <HI>alchemi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>weight</HI> of gold, it is more than nineteen times heavier than water, bulk for bulk, and this property is in&s;eparable from it; it being impo&s;&s;ible to render gold more
<PB N="349" REF="364">or le&s;s heavy; and for this rea&s;on, the <HI>&s;pecific gravity</HI> of gold, if it had no other criterion, might demon&s;trate <HI>real gold.</HI> To make gold, other metals mu&s;t be rendered equiponderant to it: And therefore, if an alchemi&s;t &s;hould offer to obtrude a metal on you for gold, hang an equal weight of pure, and of &s;u&s;pected gold by two threads to a nice ballance, and on immerging them in water, if the alchemi&s;t's gold be pure, the water will retain both pieces in <HI>oequilibrio;</HI> otherwi&s;e, the adulterate metal will ri&s;e, and the pure de&s;cend.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on is, all bodies lo&s;e &s;ome of their weight in a fluid, and the weight which a body lo&s;es in a fluid, is to its whole weight, as the &s;pecific gravity of the fluid is to that of the body. The &s;pecific gravity of a body is the weight of it, when the bulk is given; 38 grains of gold weighed in the air, is not the true weight of it: for there it lo&s;es the weight of an equal bulk of air: It weighs only 36 grains in the water, and there it lo&s;es the weight of as much water, as is equal in bulk to it&s;elf, that is, 2 grains, and as the gold weighs 38 grains, it follows, that the weight of water is to that of gold, bulk for bulk, as 2 to 38, that is, as the weight lo&s;t in the fluid is to the whole weight.</P>
<P>And &s;o, if a piece of gold, and a piece of copper, are equiponderant in air, yet in water the gold will outweigh the copper; becau&s;e
<PB N="350" REF="365">their bulks, tho' of equal weight, are inver&s;ely as their &s;pecific gravities, that is, the gold mu&s;t be as much le&s;s than the copper, as the &s;pecific gravity of gold is greater than that of copper: And as they mu&s;t both lo&s;e weight in proportion to bulk in water, therefore the gold, the le&s;&s;er of the two, lo&s;es le&s;s of its weight than the copper does, and con&s;e|quently, out-weighs the copper in water. I hope this is clear. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame, in proportion, in pure gold, and gold mixed with other metals. The bulk of the pure gold mu&s;t be le&s;s than that of allayed gold, and its weight greater in water; tho' both equiponderate (a pound &s;uppo&s;e) in air.</P>
<P>It is very plain, Sir, and I reque&s;t you will proceed. You give me valuable information, and oblige me very much. This plea&s;ed the Chemi&s;t, and the ingenious little <HI>Ribble</HI> went on.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of gold, we mean, by a &s;imple body, that who&s;e minute&s;t part has all the phy&s;ical properties of the whole ma&s;s. Now di&s;&s;olve a grain of gold in <HI>aqua regia,</HI> and from a &s;ingle drop of the &s;olution, a par|ticle of gold may be &s;eparated, and have all the characters of gold, (except tho&s;e of mag|nitude,) though the &s;eparated particle of gold &s;hall only be the millionth part of the grain. &mdash;Or, fu&s;e a &s;ingle grain of gold with a ma&s;s of &s;ilver, and mix the whole together, &s;o that
<PB N="351" REF="366">the gold &s;hall be equally di&s;tributed: then take a particle thereof, and you will have a par|ticle of perfect gold; for di&s;&s;olve the lea&s;t part of the mixture in <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> and a quantity of gold will precipitate to the bottom. It will bear the &s;ame proportion to the grain, that the part di&s;&s;olved did to the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>aqua regia</HI> and <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> I mu&s;t, to be intelligible, &s;ay two or three words in relation to them. <HI>Aqua regia</HI> is an extract by fire from &s;ea-&s;alt and &s;pirit of nitre. The acid liquor that comes over from them into the receiver, is <HI>aqua regis.&mdash;Aqua fortis,</HI> or <HI>&s;pirit of nitre,</HI> is a nitrous acid &s;eparated from its ba&s;is, <HI>nitre,</HI> by the vitriolic acid. <HI>Aqua regis</HI> only will di&s;&s;olve gold. Silver is not &s;oluble by <HI>aqua regis;</HI> its proper &s;olvent is the <HI>acid of nitre</HI> or <HI>aqua fortis.</HI> &mdash; But if you want to &s;eparate a ma&s;s of gold and &s;ilver, either will do. You may di&s;&s;olve the gold by <HI>aqua regia,</HI> and let the &s;ilver remain pure: or, di&s;&s;olve the &s;ilver by <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> and let the gold remain pure. Only note in this ca&s;e of a mixed lump of gold and &s;ilver, the operation by <HI>aqua fortis</HI> is preferable, for this rea&s;on; that <HI>aqua regis</HI> in di&s;&s;olving the gold, takes up likewi&s;e a little &s;ilver; but <HI>aqua fortis</HI> hath not the lea&s;t effect on gold:&mdash;And note further, that if there be equal parts of gold and &s;ilver in the mixture, they cannot be
<PB N="352" REF="367">parted by <HI>aqua fortis.</HI> It has not then the lea&s;t effect on the &s;ilver, which is very &s;trange. To make <HI>aqua fortis</HI> act duly on &s;ilver mixed with gold, the &s;ilver mu&s;t be at lea&s;t in a triple proportion to that of the gold. The rea&s;on of the &s;ingular effect is, that when the gold exceeds, or the parts of both are equal in quantity, then, as both are intimate, united in the ma&s;s, the parts or minims of the gold coat over the parts of the &s;ilver, and defend them from the action of the <HI>aqua fortis.</HI> In this ca&s;e, <HI>aqua regia</HI> mu&s;t be u&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the gold, and leave the &s;ilver pure: or, as <HI>aqua regia</HI> takes up a little of the &s;ilver, when it di&s;&s;olves the gold, melt the metalline ma&s;s, and add as much &s;ilver, as will make it a triple proportion to the gold. Then you may by <HI>aqua fortis</HI> take up all your &s;ilver in the di&s;&s;olution, and leave all the gold pure.</P>
<P>But as to the third criterion of gold, its being the mo&s;t fixed of all bodies, this is evident from the violence of fire having no effect on it. An ounce of it expo&s;ed for the &s;pace of two months, in the eye of a gla&s;s furnace, does not lo&s;e half a grain. It may from thence be &s;aid to be incorruptible.</P>
<P>As to gold's re&s;i&s;ting <HI>antimony,</HI> and not turn|ing into <HI>&s;coriae</HI> by its force, it is mo&s;t certain from hence, that if you take a ma&s;s con&s;i&s;ting of gold, &s;ilver, copper, the other metals, with &s;tones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and fu&s;e it with antimony, the
<PB N="353" REF="368">bodies will flow on the &s;urface, and be ea&s;ily blown off by the bellows: the antimony all evaporates, and leaves the gold alone. This is called the la&s;t te&s;t of gold, to try the purity of it. If the remaining gold have lo&s;t nothing of its weight, it is allowed perfectly pure, and called <HI>gold of twenty-four carats;</HI> or if it be found 1/24 lighter, it is &s;aid to be twenty-three carats fine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The won|derful ductility of gold.</NOTE>But as to the <HI>ductility</HI> of gold, this is the mo&s;t extraordinary property of it. The arts of gold-beating and wire-drawing, &s;hew us things quite amazing. In leaf-gold, a grain and a quarter of the metal, may be made to cover an area of fifty &s;quare inches; and if the leaf be divided by parallel lines 1/100 part of an inch, a grain of gold will be divided into five hundred thou&s;and minute &s;quares, all di&s;cernible by the eye: yet this is not the mo&s;t can be done by the hammer. A &s;ingle grain of gold may be &s;tretched into a leaf that will cover a hou&s;e, and yet the leaf remain &s;o compact, as not to tran&s;mit the rays of light, nor ever admit &s;pirit of wine to tran|&s;ude. This however is nothing to the effects of wire-drawing.</P>
<P>A gold wire is only a &s;ilver one gilt, and if you coat a &s;ilver cylinder of forty-eight ounces weight, with one ounce of gold, which is &s;ufficient, this cylinder may be drawn out into a wire &s;o very fine, that two yards thereof
<PB N="354" REF="369" MS="y">&s;hall weigh only one grain, and 98 yards only 49 grains, &s;o that one grain of gold gilds 98 yards; and of cour&s;e the ten thou&s;andth part of a grain, is above one third part of an inch long. And &s;ince the third part of an inch is yet capable of being divided into ten le&s;&s;er parts vi&s;ible to the eye, it is evident that the hundred thou&s;andth part of a grain of gold, may be &s;een without the help of a micro|&s;cope: And yet &s;o intimately do its parts co|here, that though the gold wherewith the wire is coated, be &s;tretched to &s;uch a degree, there is not any appearance of the colour of &s;ilver underneath. Nor is this all.</P>
<P>In <HI>&s;upergildings,</HI> that is, to make the riche&s;t lace, they employ but 6 ounces of gold, to cover or gild 45 marks of &s;ilver, that is, <HI>twenty-two pounds and a half avordupoi&s;e weight,</HI> rounded into the form of a cylinder or roller, which hath fifteen lines in diameter, and twenty-two inches in length; and here the &s;tratum of gold which invelopes the ingot that is to be drawn into wire, hath no more thick|ne&s;s than the fifteenth part of a line, which is extremely thin; as a line is the twelfth part of an inch.</P>
<P>But to make the common gold-thread, they do not u&s;e more than two ounces of gold, and &s;ometimes not more than one, to gild or cover ingot I have mentioned, and then the inve|loping &s;tratum is not more in thickne&s;s, if
<PB N="355" REF="370" MS="y">two ounces be employed, than the 45th part of a line; and if one ounce be u&s;ed, but the 90th part of a line. Two ounces of gold is generally u&s;ed, in gilding or covering the ingot I have mentioned, and va&s;tly thinner mu&s;t the &s;tratum be, when the ingot is drawn till it &s;urpa&s;&s;es the <HI>finene&s;s</HI> of a <HI>hair,</HI> and the dia|meter is nine thou&s;and times &s;maller than what it had in the ma&s;s: By weighing out half a dram of this thread or wire, it is found by mea&s;uring the length of the half dram, that the ingot of 22 &frac12; pounds, and 22 inches long, is changed into a length of 1163520 feet, that is, ninety-&s;ix leagues and 196 fa|thom; for the half dram of wire or thread mea&s;ures 202 feet; by con&s;equence, an ounce of it, 3232 feet; a mark of it, or eight oun|ces, 25856 feet. And yet, a&s;toni&s;hing as this length is, for two ounces of bold to be drawn to, the gold which covers the &s;ilver never cea&s;es to gild it. The gold &s;till keeps pace with the wire, &s;tretch it to what length the drawers can, through the wire-drawing irons, and holes much &s;maller one than an|other. The &s;ilver never appears.</P>
<P>It does not however re&s;t there. Before the thread or wire is wound on &s;ilk, and before they &s;pin it, it mu&s;t be flatted by pa&s;&s;ing it between &s;teel wheels extremely well poli&s;hed, and this flatting increa&s;es its length to more than a &s;eventh part. One ingot, therefore,
<PB N="356" REF="371">of 8 marks or 22 &frac12; pounds, and 22 inches long, by this increa&s;e of a 7th part, is brought to the length of 111 leagues, that is, about 300 Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P>But amazing as this extent is, it is not the utmo&s;t bounds to which the ductility of gold may be carried. One ounce only of gold is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to cover one ingot, and drawn to the length I have mentioned, and by the time it has pa&s;&s;ed the flatting wheels, the gold that covers the &s;ilver <HI>laminae,</HI> mu&s;t have its thickne&s;s reduced to le&s;s than the millionth part of a line; that is, a twelve millionth of an inch. This is beyond the reach of our conception. Imagination cannot plumb her line &s;o low.</P>
<P>But, Sir, (I &s;aid) May not the gold be divided into &s;mall grains <HI>&s;eparate</HI> one from another, but yet <HI>near enough</HI> to give their co|lour to the &s;ilver? Though we may not be able to &s;ee the thing, yet I think it may be imagined; the <HI>gold</HI> on the <HI>laminae</HI> doth not form a continued leaf.</P>
<P>Experience, good Sir, demon&s;trates the contrary,&mdash;that every point of &s;ilver hath its cover of gold. Put a piece of this gilt wire in <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> the &s;ilver will be di&s;&s;olved, and the gold left a perfect, continuous tube. It is an amazing thing! And &s;hews the a&s;toni&s;h|ing power of the fir&s;t cau&s;e! As to the rea|&s;on of this ductility, and why gold in &s;uch a
<PB N="357" REF="372">manner adheres to &s;ilver, &s;o as never to part from it, if the 22 &frac12; pounds of &s;ilver gilded with one ounce of gold could be extended by art for ever, this is pa&s;t our finding out. It is a &s;ecret of nature we cannot form any idea of.</P>
<P><HI>Caligno&s;a nocte premit Deus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ribble</HI> went on. The&s;e are the things mo&s;t remarkable in relation to <HI>gold;</HI> and I have only to add, that as to the manner of getting it, it is found &s;ometimes in glebes or clods, con&s;i&s;ting of gold alone; &s;ometimes in a powdry form, and then called <HI>gold- du&s;t,</HI> or &s;and-gold, in the &s;ands and mud of rivers and brooks; but mo&s;t commonly in whiti&s;h clods, dug out of mines of va&s;t depth, and intermixed with &s;ilver and various fo&s;&s;ils. This they reduce by fire to a ma&s;s of metal, and by <HI>aqua regia</HI> or <HI>aqua fortis,</HI> the gold is ea&s;ily taken out of the ore.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>gold</HI>'s being &s;o yielding and <HI>duc|tile</HI> by human art, it is to be ob&s;erved, that in return it exerts a greater power on the human mind. Pa&s;&s;ive it is in its ductility, but more active in its influence on man. It is a <HI>greater tyrant</HI> than a <HI>&s;lave.</HI> It drives re|peated millions of the human race to death and hell. King of metals as it is, bright and glorious to behold, and what procures innumerable ble&s;&s;ings to mankind; yet, with|out the grace of God, to moderate the pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="358" REF="373">for it, and to direct the mind in a true u&s;e of it, it is more dangerous to beings on a trial in a fir&s;t &s;tate, than even poverty can be in this lower hemi&s;phere. What villainies are daily com|mitted to get it! What iniquities daily perpe|trated by tho&s;e who have plenty of it! <HI>Lead us not into temptation,</HI> &s;hould relate as well to too much of it, as to a total want of it; and it is well prayed,&mdash;<HI>In all time of our wealth, good Lord deliver us.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Ribble</HI>'s con+clu&s;ion, containing his reli|gious thoughts and advice.</NOTE>In my opinion, neither poverty nor riches, but a middle &s;tate, is the thing we &s;hould de&s;ire. It is in this condition, we can be&s;t live <HI>&s;oberly,</HI> or with a &s;ound mind, and con|duct our&s;elves as tho&s;e who have an intelligent &s;pirit to pre&s;ide in body. Too much gold mo&s;t commonly inverts this order, and pro|duces an apo&s;ta&s;y that &s;ets the inferior powers in the throne, and en&s;laves the mind to the body: It gives the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> the <HI>commanding in|fluence,</HI> and makes <HI>rea&s;on</HI> receive <HI>law</HI> from <HI>appetite.</HI></P>
<P>If we look into the world, we find too often, in this ca&s;e, that wealth is big with innumerable &s;ins. The rich are filled with wine, wherein is exce&s;s, and &s;hew an un|bridled di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners. Their eyes behold &s;trange women, and their hearts utter perver&s;e things. In&s;tead of regarding the common good, they commit the mo&s;t extra|vagant
<PB N="359" REF="374">injuries. Of &s;uch a hardning nature is too much <HI>gold,</HI> that it tends to make con|&s;cience in&s;en&s;ible and &s;tupid, and renders it for ever unapt for impre&s;&s;ion. Then whore|dom and wine, and new wine, take away the heart, and men are made to forget the law of God.</P>
<P>But having neither poverty nor riches, in the calm middle &s;tate, having all rea&s;onable conveniencies, we can fairly come by; a va&s;t variety of creatures for our food, and <HI>wine</HI> in its &s;ea&s;on, to <HI>make glad the heart;</HI> we may then partake of the bounties of providence, with a &s;ober freedom, and at the &s;ame time, can be&s;t lay up for our&s;elves a good foun|dation, or &s;ecuity for the time to come, that we may lay hold of eternal life.</P>
<P>Tho' it is with a pro&s;pect of difficulties, that all mu&s;t enter upon religion, and with labour and difficulty, maintain our ground, and acquit our&s;elves like chri&s;tians, that is, re&s;i&s;t the devil in all his a&s;&s;aults, overcome the world in its en&s;naring influence, and mor|tify the irregular inclinations of nature; yet in the happy middle &s;tate, where there is no poverty nor riches, that is, great wealth, we can make everla&s;ting glory and felicity our governing aim, and bound our ambition and de&s;ires by nothing &s;hort of the re&s;urrection of the dead. We may live in a full and ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul to the authority of
<PB N="360" REF="375">God's word. Things eternal may have the a&s;cendant in our practical judgment, and then with plea&s;ure we become followers of them, who through faith and patience inhe|rit the promi&s;es.</P>
<P>Good Sir, this is all our &s;owing time, and what&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. He that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of his fle&s;h reap corruption; but he that &s;oweth to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap everla&s;t|ing life. And therefore, whether your lot be ca&s;t in the happy middling &s;tate, or you were born to thou&s;ands a year, let wi&s;dom be your rule, and prefer that happine&s;s which has everla&s;ting duration, in the realms of light above, to any pre&s;ent good that can come in competition with it. Do not &s;pend money for that which is not bread&mdash; and your la|bour for that which &s;atisfieth not. Do not employ your pains for that which hath <HI>vanity</HI> written upon it, by the word of God, by the te&s;timony of the wi&s;e&s;t men, and by frequent experience: but let your princi|pal regard be for your immortal &s;oul, when nothing can be given in exchange for the &s;oul. Implore the light and grace of the good &s;pi|rit, and by the quickening influences of the Father of the univer&s;e, and the exertion of your whole &s;trength, let it be the principal labour of your every day, to make advances in the divine life, and be a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ociety
<PB N="361" REF="376">wherever you come. In <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>charity</HI> may you excel.</P>
<P>You will pardon old <HI>Ribble,</HI> I hope, good Sir, and excu&s;e his addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to you in this manner. It is an odd conclu&s;ion, I own, to a di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>metals</HI> and <HI>&s;emi-metals;</HI> but it is from an extreme regard I have con|ceived for you, that I talk as I do, and pre|&s;ume to call upon you, (as you are a young man of fortune, I &s;uppo&s;e) to con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly of that <HI>decree,</HI> which is the re&s;ult of unerring wi&s;dom, and the will of the Rector of the univer&s;e, to wit, that we are all under the <HI>law of death,</HI> and through that gate mu&s;t pa&s;s, perhaps at a day's, an hour's warning, to the <HI>re&s;urrection of the dead,</HI> to be adjudged to happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, as time has been em|ployed, and life &s;pent here. This is the <HI>de|cree</HI> of the Mo&s;t High God, and of con&s;e|quence, it is incumbent on us, to prepare for the <HI>awful hereafter,</HI> and endeavour by good actions, and a virtuous mind, by purity of con&s;cience, and an exalted piety, to <HI>come off well</HI> in judgment.

<P>Here little <HI>Ribble</HI> the <HI>Chemi&s;t</HI> had done, and I had rea&s;on to return him my very hearty thanks for the favour of his whole di&s;cour&s;e. I was va&s;tly obliged to him for the knowledge he had given me, in relation to the philo&s;o|phy of metals, and taking him by the hand,
<PB N="362" REF="377">promi&s;ed him, that I would ever gratefully remember his moral conclu&s;ion. This plea&s;ed the old gentleman, and at four in the after|noon we parted.</P>

Reflecting on the wonders of the metals, which I had heard old <HI>Ribble</HI> &s;o well di&s;cour&s;e of, and being more intent on what had been told me of the&s;e things, that I might never forget &s;uch u&s;eful learning, I trotted on for &s;everal hours without minding the road, and arrived as the &s;un was &s;etting in a deep and melancholy vale, through which a plea&s;ant river run, that by the mur|mur of its &s;treams, &s;eemed to be marked out for the rendezvous of the thoughtful, who love the deep rece&s;&s;es, and embowring woods, with the &s;oft thrillings of gliding &s;treams, as much as the &s;prightly court the gaye&s;t &s;cenes. In this &s;weet &s;pot, I found a pretty country hou&s;e, and not knowing where I was, rid up to the door, to enquire my way. A gen|tleman, who &s;eemed to be about forty, im|mediately appeared, let me know I was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any town, and as it was near ten, told me I had be&s;t re&s;t with him that night, and I was mo&s;t heartily welcome. This was humane and civil. I accepted the kind invitation, and immediately went in with him. He brought me into a decent room, and gave me a hand&s;ome meal. We
<PB N="363" REF="378">had a couple of bottles after &s;upper, talked of a thou&s;and things, and then withdrew to wind up the machines. He would not let me &s;tir the next morning, and after dinner we became well acquainted. Six days this gentleman prevailed with me to &s;tay at his hou&s;e, and then I left him with regret. He was &s;o generous, &s;o civil, and in every thing &s;o agreeable, that I could not avoid admiring him, and regarding him to an ex|treme degree. His name was <HI>Monckton.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Mr. <HI>Monckton.</HI></NOTE>&sect; 4. <HI>Avery Monckton</HI> had &s;een the world, when he was a young man, and by reading much, and thinking a great deal, had ac|quired an exten&s;ive knowledge, and a deep penetration. In him the gentleman and the &s;cholar were vi&s;ible. He &s;eemed &s;u|perior to folly, and his philo&s;ophy appeared to be an a&s;&s;iduous examination of his ideas, fancies, and opinions, in order to render them true and ju&s;t. His religion con&s;i&s;ted in a chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine plea&s;ure, with re&s;pect to all things independent of us, or ab&s;olutely external to us; and in a conti|nued exertion of benevolence, in doing all the good he could. What the theology of &s;ects was, and the notions of divines, he never minded. It was his opinion, that an <HI>active charity</HI> is the only thing that can <HI>liken</HI> and <HI>approve</HI> us to the original benevolent mind:
<PB N="364" REF="379">and that it is rea&s;onable to &s;ubmit to all his di&s;pen&s;ations, &s;ince the providence of an in|finitely perfect Being, mu&s;t do all for the be&s;t in the whole. This was <HI>Avery Monckton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> In his per&s;on he was tall, and very thin.</P>
<P>This gentleman told me the following re|markable &s;tory relating to him&s;elf, on my a&s;king him, if he had ever been married?&mdash; Yes, Sir, he replied: When I was about five and twenty, a young lady came in my way, who had all the external charms that ever adorned a woman, and I thought her mind as perfect in goodne&s;s of every kind, as minds can be on this earth. I made my addre&s;&s;es to her, and with &s;ome difficulty per&s;uaded her to accept of a good jointure, and be a wife; for &s;he had got it into her head, that chri&s;tian perfection con&s;i&s;ted in a virgin-life. I loved her to an extreme de|gree, and fancied my&s;elf beyond mortals happy, as her fondne&s;s &s;eemed equal to my pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it in a mo&s;t tran&s;|porting way. Three months pa&s;&s;ed on in this delightful manner, and I &s;hould have thought an age but minutes, if the &s;cene was to have no change. But every thing mu&s;t have an end in this poor &s;tate. Bu&s;ine&s;s called me one morning early into the city, and till it was late at night, I thought not to return: Back however I was compelled to
<PB N="365" REF="380">go for &s;ome papers, I had forgot, and de|&s;igning to &s;urprize agreeably my wife, came in by a key I had, at the wa&s;h-hou&s;e door, and un&s;een went &s;oftly up to my chamber, where I expected to find my beloved in a &s;weet &s;leep. Gently I touched the lock, and intended, as my charmer &s;lumbered, to give this idol of my heart a ki&s;s: But, as I opened the door without being heard, I &s;aw a man by my bed-&s;ide, and my fond faithful wife, buttoning up his breeches. Amazement &s;eized me, but I was not in a rage. I only &s;aid, is that <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> I &s;ee, and &s;hut the door. Down &s;tairs I went immediately, and out again the &s;ame way I came in. I was done with love for ever, and from that time never &s;aw my wife more. A &s;hip being to &s;ail the next day for <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I went a pa&s;&s;en|ger in it, and re&s;olved to live abroad &s;ome years.</P>
<P>Six years I re&s;ided in <HI>Greece,</HI> and vi&s;ited every curious place: Four I &s;pent in <HI>A&s;ia minor,</HI> and two in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> I di|verted my&s;elf with noting down the extra|ordinary things I &s;aw, and I purcha&s;ed &s;everal fine antiquities by the way. When done, I came back to my country again, and this little &s;eat I now live at, being to be &s;old, I bought it immediately, and have re&s;ided here ever &s;ince. My &s;tudy, my garden, and my hor&s;e, divert me fully and finely every day.
<PB N="366" REF="381">I have all I de&s;ire in this world, and reign more happily over my few &s;ubjects, in this airy, &s;ilent, &s;ecret &s;pot, than the greate&s;t mo|narch can do on a throne. My people are only one young man, who is my gardener, my footman, and my groom, and two old women, my maids. The&s;e are ever attentive to my will, and by their good behaviour and management, make my lodge as agreeable, and life as plea&s;ing, as can be expected in this &s;y&s;tem of things.</P>
<P><HI>Monckton</HI>'s &s;tory plea&s;ed me much, and I wondered greatly at his happy temper, when he &s;aw his beloved wife buttoning up the breeches of the man. But did you ever hear what became of her after?&mdash;And faulty as &s;he was, may there not be found an ho|ne&s;t charming woman, to render your hours more delightful than &s;tudy and contrivance can make them, without a &s;oft partner thro' life? Come into the world with me, Sir, and I will engage to find out for you a mere primitive chri&s;tian of a woman, with all the beauties of body that <HI>Lucian</HI> gives his images.</P>
<P>You are very good, Sir, (<HI>Monckton</HI> replied) in offering to look out for another wife for me, and I thank you very heartily, for your well-meant kindne&s;s; but as I never enquired what became of my fir&s;t wife, from the morning I left her, and know only that &s;he is dead,
<PB N="367" REF="382">as her jointure has not been demanded for &s;everal years pa&s;t; &s;o &s;hall I never be con|cerned with a &s;econd. Perhaps there are &s;ome hone&s;t women in the world. I hope &s;o: but I have had enough of marriage. Be&s;ide, I think it time now to turn my thoughts a better way. In the forty-fifth year of my age, it cannot be weak, to begin to con&s;ider the great change before me, and fix my hopes on a good remove into &s;ome better and happier region. If I was unfortunate with a wife when a young man, I have little rea&s;on to expect better days with one, as age comes on. I might find my&s;elf again mo&s;t &s;adly mi&s;|taken. But there can be no di&s;appointment in making it the principal work of life, to prepare, in &s;uch a retirement as this, for that approaching hour, when we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the power and tyranny of death and corrup|tion. By this means, the greate&s;t happine&s;s may be &s;ecured. In every thing el&s;e, there is uncertainty and vanity. I &s;peak princi|pally in re&s;pect of my time of life, who am ha&s;tning fa&s;t to fifty: but at every time, it is my opinion, that men, as rationals, and beings who take on them&s;elves the honourable profe&s;|&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion, &s;hould not comply with the criminal liberties allowed in the world, and give into the illicit u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of place and company, for fear of ridicule, or to avoid giving offence; but keep

<P>I do not &s;ay this by way of preaching, but that you may thereby have a truer idea of the man you chanced to find in a lone hou&s;e on this va&s;t common. Seven years have I now lived here, and in all that time, have not been once in <HI>London:</HI> but &s;ome|times I ride to a neighbouring village, and if on the road, or at an inn, I can pick up a &s;en|&s;ible agreeable man, I love to dine with him, and drink a pint of wine. Such a man I fre|quently ride in que&s;t of, and if he be intirely to my mind, (which is very rarely the ca&s;e,) I invite him home with me, to pa&s;s at my lodge two or three days. Far then am I from being un&s;ocial, though I live in &s;oli|tude; but I left the world, becau&s;e I was ill-u&s;ed in it, and happen to think very differently from the generality of men.

<PB N="381" REF="396">and lay as the <HI>clod of the valley</HI> before me. Her body I depo&s;ited in the next church|yard, and immediately after, rid as fa&s;t as I could to <HI>London,</HI> to lo&s;e thought in di&s;&s;ipa|tion, and re&s;ign the better to the decree.

That I &s;aid was not then in my power to do: but I would, one time or other, give the public a true account of him,
<PB N="382" REF="397">and make it conclude I hoped to the glory of his character. Here it is.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pic|ture and character of <HI>Curl</HI> the Book&s;eller.</NOTE>&sect;. 2. CURL was in per&s;on very tall and thin, an ungainly, aukward, white-faced man. His eyes were a light-grey, large, projecting, gog|le and pur-blind. He was &s;play-footed, and baker-kneed.</P>
<P>He had a good natural under&s;tanding, and was well acquainted with more than the title pages of books. He talked well on &s;ome &s;ubjects. He was not an infidel as Mrs. <HI>Rowe</HI> mi&s;repre&s;ents him in one of her letters to lady <HI>Hartford,</HI> (afterwards Dutche&s;s of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>). He told me, it was quite evident to him, that the <HI>&s;criptures</HI> of the Old and New Te&s;tament contained a <HI>real revelation.</HI> There is for it a <HI>rational, a natural, a tradi|tionary,</HI> and a <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> te&s;timony; which rendered it quite certain to him. He &s;aid, he no more doubted the truth of the chri|&s;tian religion, than he did the exi&s;tence of an independent &s;upreme Creator; but he did not believe the expo&s;itions given by the di|vines. So far <HI>Curl</HI> was right enough. His fault was, that with &s;uch a belief, he took no pains with his heart. Tru&s;ting intirely to the <HI>merits the Saviour,</HI> like too many other mi&s;taken chri&s;tians, he had no notion of religion as an <HI>invi&s;ible thing within us,</HI> called the <HI>kingdom of God:</HI> He did not even con&s;ider it as a good out&s;ide thing, that
<PB N="383" REF="398">recommends a man to his fellow-creatures. He was a debauchee to the la&s;t degree, and &s;o injurious to &s;ociety, that by filling his tran|&s;lations with wretched notes, forged letters, and bad pictures, he rai&s;ed the price of a four &s;hilling book to ten. Thus, in particular, he managed <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Archiology: And when I told him he was very culpable in this, and other articles he &s;old, his an&s;wer was, What would I have him do? He was a book&s;eller. His <HI>tran&s;lators</HI> in <HI>pay,</HI> lay three in a bed, at the <HI>Pewter-Platter</HI> Inn in <HI>Holborn,</HI> and he and they were for ever at work, to de|ceive the Public. He likewi&s;e printed the lewde&s;t things. He lo&s;t his ears for the <HI>Nun in her Smock,</HI> and another thing. As to drink, he was too fond of money, to &s;pend any in making him&s;elf happy that way; but at another's expence, he would drink every day till he was quite blind, and as incapable of &s;elf-motion as a block. This was <HI>Edmund Curl:</HI> But he died at la&s;t as great a penitent, (I think in the year 1748) as ever expired. I mention this to his glory.</P>
<P>As <HI>Curl</HI> knew the world well, and was acquainted with &s;everal extraordinary charac|ters, he was of great u&s;e to me at my fir&s;t coming to town, as I knew nobody, nor any place. He gave me the true characters of many I &s;aw, told me whom I &s;hould avoid, and with whom I might be free. He brought me to the play-hou&s;es, and gave me a judi|cious
<PB N="384" REF="399">account of every actor. He under|&s;tood tho&s;e things well. No man could talk better on theatrical &s;ubjects. He brought me likewi&s;e to Sadler's Wells, to the night-cellars, and to <HI>Tom King</HI>'s, the famous night-hou&s;e at <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> As he was very knowing, and well-known at &s;uch places, he &s;oon made me as wi&s;e as him&s;elf in the&s;e branches of learning; and, in &s;hort, in the &s;pace of a month, I was as well acquainted in <HI>London,</HI> as if I had been there for years. My kind preceptor &s;pared no pains in lecturing.</P>
<P>But what of all things I thought mo&s;t wonderful was the company I &s;aw at the Sieur <HI>Curl</HI>'s. As he was intimate with all the high whores in town, many of them frequented his &s;hop, to buy his dialogues, and other lively books. Some of the&s;e girls he often a&s;ked to dine with him, and then I was &s;ure to be a gue&s;t. Many very fine women I thereby &s;aw, but none worth men|tioning, till <HI>Carola Bennet</HI> arrived. She did &s;urprize me. Her mind and body were very wonderful, and I imagine a de&s;cription of her, and her &s;tory afterward will not be un|grateful to my readers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pic|ture of <HI>Ca|rola Bennet.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 3. <HI>Carola Bennet</HI> was at this time in the two and twentieth year of her age, a dazzling beauty in the height of life and vigour. Her eyes were black and amazingly fine: Her mouth charming: Her neck and brea&s;t very
<PB N="385" REF="400">beautiful: Her &s;tature was ju&s;t what it ought to be. She had a glow of health, a lu&s;cious air, and a bewitching vivacity: Her manners were wonderfully winning, and the tone of her voice &s;o &s;weet and in&s;inuating, that her words and looks went directly to the heart. She had read many books of gaiety, wit, and humour; e&s;pecially the French; and talked delightfully on &s;uch &s;ubjects. She &s;ang to perfection: but her conver&s;ation was too free, and &s;he &s;eemed to have no &s;en&s;e of any re|ligion. It was a fine entertainment to be in her company, as I often was, yet I could not help &s;ighing, to &s;ee &s;o many any perfections on the brink of everla&s;ting de&s;truction.&mdash;This young lady all of a &s;udden di&s;appeared. <HI>Curl</HI> knew not what was become of her: but as I rid ten years after through <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> in the fine&s;t part of that romantic county, I &s;aw her one morning, (as I &s;topped to water my hor&s;e in a brook that ran from a park,) &s;itting on a &s;eat, under a va&s;t beautiful cedar tree, with a book in her hand. I thought I was no &s;tranger to the fine face, and as I was pretty near to her, I called out, and a&s;ked, if &s;he was not Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet?</HI> She knew me at once, and pointing to a gate that was only latched, de&s;ired I would come to her. I went and found &s;he was the mi&s;tre&s;s of the fine &s;eat at a &s;mall di&s;tance off. She brought me into the hou&s;e, would not &s;uffer me to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s <HI>Ben|net.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 4. <HI>Carola Bennet</HI> was the daughter of <HI>John Bennet,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a <HI>York&s;hire</HI> gentleman, who died when &s;he was in her 19th year, and left her in the care of her aunt, an old lady who was outwardly all &s;aint, and within a devil. This <HI>Carola</HI> knew well, and re|que&s;ted her father to get another guardian for her, or leave her to manage her&s;elf; for Mrs. <HI>Hunfleet,</HI> her aunt, was far from being that primitive chri&s;tian he took her for, and &s;o great a mi&s;er, that exclu&s;ive of all her other vices, her avarice alone was enough to ruin her niece. She would &s;acrifice the whole human race for half a thou&s;and pounds. But all his daughter &s;aid was in vain. He believed his &s;i&s;ter was godline&s;s it&s;elf, in its utmo&s;t latitude and extent; that &s;he lived a con|tinued oppo&s;ition to our mortal enemies, the world, &s;in, and the devil; and that her heart was a mere magazine of univer&s;al hone&s;ty, probity of manners, and goodne&s;s of life and conver&s;ation. Integrity and rectitude, and benevolence, as he thought, were the bright criterions of her &s;oul. She will teach you, <HI>Carola,</HI> to fa&s;t and pray, and make you like her&s;elf, a mere &s;aint.</P>
<P>It was to no purpo&s;e then for the daughter to remon&s;trate: She could only weep, as her
<PB N="387" REF="402">father was po&s;itive, and after his death was obliged to go home with Mrs. <HI>Hunfleet.</HI> There, as &s;he expected, &s;he had too much of the outward bodily exerci&s;e of religion, every thing that can be named within the circle of external wor&s;hip; &s;uch as public and private &s;ervices, fa&s;tings, macerations, bowings, expanded hands and lifted eyes, which Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> (in his advice to a daugh|ter,) calls the <HI>holy goggle:</HI> but that all this accompanied the internal acts of the old wo|man's mind, and went along with her heart and &s;oul, <HI>Carola</HI> had rea&s;on to doubt. She &s;aw it was but outward profe&s;&s;ion, &mdash; all hy|pocri&s;y, &mdash; that her life belied her creed, and her practice was a renunciation of the chri&s;tian religion. This appeared to be the ca&s;e very quickly. The aunt &s;old her to one <HI>Canta|lupe</HI> for five hundred pounds. Under pretence of taking her to vi&s;it a friend, &s;he brought her to a private <HI>bagnio,</HI> or one of tho&s;e hou&s;es called <HI>convents.</HI></P>

<P>In the&s;e <HI>brothels</HI> the Sieur <HI>Curl</HI> was well known, and as the wine in them is always excellent, (but a &s;hilling a bottle dearer than at the tavern,) and one &s;its without hearing the lea&s;t noi&s;e, or being &s;een by any one, I have often gone with this ingenious man to &s;uch places, on account of the purity of the wine, and the &s;tillne&s;s of the hou&s;e; as there are no waiters there, nor any well-dre&s;t hu&s;&s;ies to come in the way. You are as &s;ilent as in a cave; nor does a woman appear, except as before excepted, unle&s;s it be by appoint|ment at this kind of <HI>meeting-hou&s;e,</HI> as &s;uch places may well be called: for there not &s;el|dom does many a married woman meet her gallant. One evening that I was there with <HI>Curl,</HI> there came in the wife of a very emi|nent merchant, a lady of as excellent a cha|racter as any in the world; who was never &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected by any of her acquaint|ance, but allowed by every body to be a wo|man of pure morals and un&s;potted cha|&s;tity. She came in fir&s;t with a black ma&s;k on her face, from her chair, and was by the woman of the hou&s;e &s;hewn into a chamber up &s;tairs: Half an hour after, there was an|other &s;oft tap at the door, and a gentleman was let in, who was &s;hewed up to the cham|ber
<PB N="389" REF="404">the lady was in: As the door of the room <HI>Curl</HI> and I were &s;itting in, happened to be open as this adventurer pa&s;&s;ed by, I knew the man. He was an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> gentleman of large fortune, with whom I was well ac|quainted. He was ever engaged in amours, and was &s;ome years after this hanged at <HI>Cork,</HI> for ravi&s;hing <HI>Sally Squib,</HI> the quaker. His name then can be no &s;ecret: But as to the the lady's name, I &s;hall never tell it, as &s;he left &s;everal children, who are now living in reputation; but only ob&s;erve, that there are, to my knowledge, many women of &s;uch &s;trict virtue in the world. If you a&s;k me reader, how I came to know who &s;he was? I will tell you. As &s;he came down &s;tairs in a ma&s;k at ten at night, in the manner &s;he went up, I concluded &s;he was a married wo|man of di&s;tinction, and followed her chair, when it went off. She changed at <HI>Temple Bar,</HI> and then took a hackney coach, which drove beyond the <HI>Royal Exchange;</HI> I followed till it &s;topped at a grand hou&s;e, into which &s;he went without a ma&s;k, and had a full view of her fine face. I enquired next day who lived in the hou&s;e I &s;aw her go into, and was told it was Mr. *****, a merchant of the greate&s;t repute. Often did I &s;ee this lady after this, was &s;everal times in her company, and if I had not known what I did, &s;hould have thought her a woman of as great vir|tue as ever lived. There was not the lea&s;t
<PB N="390" REF="405">appearance of levity or indecency in her. To all outward appearance, &s;he was cha&s;tity and di&s;cretion in fle&s;h and blood. &mdash; But as to <HI>Carola Bennet.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet</HI> continued.</NOTE>&sect;. 6. Soon after her aunt and &s;he arrived at Mrs. <HI>Bedewell</HI>'s, in came <HI>Cantalupe</HI> as a vi&s;iter, and after tea, they went to cards. Then follow|ed a &s;upper, and when that was over, they gave the innocent Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet</HI> a do&s;e, which deprived her of her &s;en&s;es, put her to bed, and in the morning &s;he found her&s;elf ruined in the arms of that villain <HI>Cantalupe.</HI> Di&s;|traction almo&s;t &s;eized her, but he would not let her &s;tir. She called, but no one came near to her relief. He &s;wore a million of oaths, that it was pure love made him buy her of her aunt, as he heard &s;he was going to marry another man, and if &s;he would but &s;hare with him in his great fortune, &s;ince the thing was done, he would, (by every &s;acred power he vowed) marry her that evening or the next, the fir&s;t time they went out, and be the true&s;t and mo&s;t tender hu&s;band that ever yet appeared in the world. This, and the &s;ituation &s;he was in, naked and cla&s;ped in his &s;trong arms, without a friend to aid her, within doors or without, made her &s;en|&s;ible her re&s;entments were in vain, and that &s;he had better acquie&s;ce, and make the man her hu&s;band, if &s;he could, &s;ince it was her
<PB N="391" REF="406">hard fate, and that in all probability &s;he might conceive from the tran&s;actions of the night. This made her have done. She lay as he reque&s;ted till noon, and hoped he would prove as faithful as he had &s;olemnly &s;wore to be.</P>
<P>But when the night came, an indi&s;po&s;ition he feigned, made him unable to &s;tir out that evening, and he reque&s;ted the idol of his heart, whom he loved more than life, to give him leave to defer it till the next. For &s;ix days he put it off in the &s;ame manner, dur|ing which time, they never &s;tirred out of the bagnio, and the &s;eventh day he left her fa&s;t a&s;leep in bed. A billet-doux on the dre&s;&s;ing-table informed her, that he was obliged to &s;et out that morning for <HI>France,</HI> and as he intended to be back in a few months, he hoped &s;he would not think him faithle&s;s at once. He left her a hundred pound bank note, which was all he had then to &s;pare, as he had paid to her aunt 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a few days before.</P>
<P>Thus fell the beautiful Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet</HI> by the treachery of her ever-cur&s;ed aunt, and was made a whore very much again&s;t her will. The aunt, in the mean time, had &s;hut up her hou&s;e, and was gone no one knew where. She took &s;everal jewels with her, and a large &s;um of money, both the property of her niece. She left her but little of her fortune, and re|ported
<PB N="392" REF="407">every where, that <HI>Carola</HI> was gone into keeping with a great man, and had before been debauched by her footman. In &s;hort, all that could be done this woman did, to impoveri&s;h and defame her niece, and as &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed upon the world for a praying vir|tuous old piece, her reports were thought &s;o true, that all the female acquaintance Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet</HI> had, laughed at the &s;tory &s;he told, and &s;hunned her as a foul fiend. She was bani&s;hed from all mode&s;t company. They con&s;idered her as the mo&s;t dete&s;table pro&s;titute, for ex|cu&s;ing her&s;elf (they &s;aid) by blackning the character of &s;o pious and upright a woman as Mrs. <HI>Hunfleet,</HI> her aunt, was.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A reflexion on hypo|crites.</NOTE>&sect;. 7. Thus did iniquity ruin and triumph over innocence in the ma&s;k of religion, and a thou&s;and times, to my own knowledge, it has done the &s;ame thing. I have often known wretches pretend to &s;eek the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the fir&s;t place, and by believing all the monks have invented, by con&s;tantly attending public wor&s;hip, and an unnatural kind of &s;obriety, pa&s;s for people that were ready and willing to &s;uffer every thing the cau&s;e of God and truth can require from rationals: yet the&s;e holy mortals could make the &s;ervice of God not only &s;tand with unwilling infirmities, (the common ca&s;e of the be&s;t humanity,) but con&s;i&s;t with wilful

One of the holie&s;t men in the world, cheated me of a thou&s;and pounds, left in his hands for my u&s;e, for fear I &s;hould &s;pend it my&s;elf. And a rich man, commonly called piety and goodne&s;s, from the &s;eeming &s;implicity of his manners, the &s;oftne&s;s of his temper, and the holy goggle of his eyes in his pub|lic devotion, arre&s;ted me on a note of hand, one third of which was intere&s;t thrown into the principal, and made me pay intere&s;t upon intere&s;t, without mercy, or waiting as I in-treated, till it was more convenient. Many more &s;uch praying, &s;anctified villains I could mention, in re&s;pect of whom <HI>Edmund Curl</HI> was a cherubim, fond as he was of a girl and a fla&s;k. <HI>Curl</HI> owned he was a &s;inner, and that he was led by thir&s;t and repletion to indulge: but the <HI>hypocrites</HI> with profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem for the <HI>pearl of great price,</HI> and that they have parted with their <HI>Herodias,</HI> for the &s;ake of eternal life; yet wilfully di&s;obey from a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ub&s;tance; and the &s;hrine of bright Mammon in this world, has a greater influence on their &s;ouls than all the joys of an everla&s;ting heaven to come.

This he proved to her &s;atisfaction, and made it plain to her conception, that by it only we can acquire a right judgment of per&s;ons and things, and have a ju&s;t and due e&s;timate of our&s;elves: that unle&s;s held in by <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>religion,</HI> plea&s;ure, though innocent of it&s;elf, becomes a thing of deadly con&s;e|quence to mortals; and if we do not u&s;e it in due time, place, circum&s;tance, mea&s;ure and limits, it nece&s;&s;arily involves us in diffi|culties and troubles, pain and infamy: if we &s;tifle the grand leading principles, <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>religion,</HI> by &s;in and vice, and let de&s;ire and inclination range beyond bounds, we mu&s;t not only plunge into various woes in this world, but as creatures degenerated below the bea&s;t, become the contempt and abhorrence of the wi&s;e and hone&s;t. To this &s;ad condi|tion mu&s;t be annexed a reflective mi&s;ery, as we have con&s;cience or rea&s;on, that will exa|mine, now and then, the whole procedure of life, do all we can to prevent it, and the remor&s;e that mu&s;t en&s;ue, on account of our wretched and ridiculous conduct, is too bitter a thing for a rea&s;onable creature to acquire, for the &s;ake of illicit gratification only; and this becomes the more grievous in reflexion, as plea&s;ures are not forbidden by religion, but allowed to the mo&s;t upright, and ordained
<PB N="397" REF="412">for the holy &s;ervice of God; to recruit na|ture, and enliven the &s;pirits; to propagate the human &s;pecies, and pre&s;erve the flame of love in the married &s;tate. If there was then no other life but this, it is mo&s;t certainly our in|tere&s;t in regard to fame and advantage, to be governed by rea&s;on and religion.</P>
<P>And if we are not to be annihilated with the bea&s;t, but are to an&s;wer hereafter for what we have done, whether it be good or bad, &s;urely the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life &s;hould be to govern our&s;elves by godline&s;s, that is, to be chri&s;tians in our principles, holy in our conver&s;ation, and upright in our behaviour. If the go&s;pel be true, (as has been proved a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times, by the wi&s;e&s;t men in the world, to the confu&s;ion and &s;ilence of infidelity,) and the Son of God came into the world, not to make <HI>Judea</HI> the &s;eat of ab|&s;olute and univer&s;al empire, and e&s;tabli&s;h a temporal dominion in all po&s;&s;ible pomp and magnificence, (as the <HI>Jews</HI> mo&s;t erroneou&s;ly and ridiculou&s;ly fancied, and to this day be|lieve,) but to prepare greater things for us; to relieve us from the power of &s;in, and the endle&s;s and un&s;peakable mi&s;eries of the life which is to come; to propo&s;e a prize far more worthy of our expectations than the glories of civil power, and to &s;ecure to us the hap|pine&s;s both of &s;oul and body to all eternity, in the kingdom of God; then certainly, in
<PB N="398" REF="413">regard to our&s;elves, we ought to attend to his heavenly le&s;&s;ons, and turn from the un|lawful enjoyments of this life, to the end|le&s;s and &s;olid happine&s;s of a future &s;tate. As this is the ca&s;e, we &s;hould cheri&s;h and im|prove a faith of invi&s;ible things, by &s;erious and impartial con&s;ideration. We &s;hould at|tend to the evidence which God has given us for the truth of chri&s;tianity, evidence very cogent and &s;ufficient; and then &s;hew our faith by works &s;uited to the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> that is, by recommending the practice of virtue, and the wor&s;hip of one God, the Creator of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider then, Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet,</HI> that you &s;tand on the brink of death, re&s;urrection, and judg|ment; and it is time to begin by &s;erious and humble enquiry to arrive at a faith of &s;trength and activity; that by your eminence in all vir|tue and holine&s;s, you may make the glorious attempt to be greate&s;t in the kingdom of hea|ven. This will be a work worthy of an im|mortal Soul: Nor will it hinder you from enjoying as much happine&s;s in this lower he|mi&s;phere, as rea&s;on can de&s;ire. For godli|ne&s;s is profitable unto all things, having pro|mi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</P>
<P>Thus (Mi&s;s <HI>Bennet</HI> that was, continued) did this excellent young clergyman talk to me, and by argument and rea&s;oning in the
<PB N="399" REF="414">gentle&s;t manner, by good &s;en&s;e and good manners; made me a convert to chri&s;tianity and goodne&s;s, He &s;natched me from the gulph of eternal perdition, and, from the realms of darkne&s;s, and the &s;ociety of devils, brought me into the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. To make me as happy as it was po&s;&s;ible even in this world, he married me, and landed me in this charming &s;pot you found me in. For &s;even years, we lived in great happine&s;s, without ever &s;tirring from this fine &s;olitude, and &s;ince his death, I have had no inclination to return to the world: I have one lady for my companion, an agreeable &s;en&s;ible woman, a near relation of Mr. <HI>Tench</HI>'s, and with her, and &s;ome good books, and three or four agreeable neighbours, have all the felicity I care for in this world. When you &s;aw me at <HI>Curl</HI>'s, I had no ta&s;te for any thing but the <HI>comedy,</HI> the <HI>opera,</HI> and a <HI>tale</HI> of <HI>La Fontaine;</HI> but you found me with a volume of <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> in my hand, under that aged and beautiful cedar, near the road; and in tho&s;e &s;ermons I now find more delight, in the &s;olemn &s;hade of one of tho&s;e fine trees, than ever I enjoyed in the gaye&s;t &s;cenes of the world. In the&s;e &s;weet &s;ilent walks I am really happy. Riches and honour are with me, yea durable riches and righteou&s;ne&s;s. To the ble&s;&s;ings of time, I can here add the riches of expectation and comfort, the riches of future glory and hap|pine&s;s.
<PB N="400" REF="415">This makes me fond of this fine retreat. In contentment, peace, and com|fort of mind, I now live. By hearkning to the commandments, my peace is a river.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>Tench</HI> had done, and I was a|mazed beyond expre&s;&s;ion. This charming libertine was quite changed. It was for|merly her wont (when I have &s;at an evening with her at <HI>Curl</HI>'s,) to make a je&s;t of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme, &mdash; to laugh at the devil and his flames; her life was all plea&s;ure, and her &s;oul all whim: but when I &s;aw her la&s;t, &s;he was &s;erious, and &s;eemed to enjoy as happy a &s;erenity and compo&s;ure of mind, as ever mortal was ble&s;&s;ed with. Even her eyes had acquired a more &s;ober light, and in the place of a wild and lu&s;cious air, a beautiful mo|de&s;ty appeared.</P>

It was owing to be &s;ure, to the word (not in-&s;poken) but taught by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his go&s;pel. When her friend <HI>Tench</HI> opened the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> to her, her good under|&s;tanding inclined her to hearken. She began to con&s;ider: She pondered, and had a regard to the go&s;pel, now laid before her, by that &s;en&s;ible and excellent young clergyman. She
<PB N="401" REF="416">became a <HI>believer.</HI> And as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, We can do all things through <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> who &s;trengthens us; that is, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Hunt,</HI> in one of his fine &s;ermons, <HI>through the direc|tions of Chri&s;t, and through the arguments and motives of the chri&s;tian doctrine.</HI> Well &s;aid, <HI>Hunt.</HI> It mu&s;t be our own choice, to be &s;ure, to be good and virtuous.

<P>Dr. <HI>Lardner,</HI> in his excellent &s;ermon on the power and efficacy of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s doctrine, has a fine ob&s;ervation; &mdash; Would any &s;ay, that the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of immediate and particular influences from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, is implied in this context, where he &s;ays, that <HI>he is a vine,</HI> and his di&s;|ciples <HI>branches,</HI> and that their bearing fruit depends as much upon influences from him, as the life and vigour of branches do upon the &s;ap derived from the root of the tree? It would be ea&s;y to an&s;wer, that the argu|ment in the text is a &s;imilitude, not literal truth. Neither is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> literally a vine, nor are his di&s;ciples, &s;trictly &s;peaking, branches. Men have a rea&s;onable, intellectual nature, above animals and vegetables.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Iri&s;h gentlemen call upon me, and bring me to a gam|ing table, kept by a company of &s;harpers, where I lo&s;e all my fortune.</NOTE>&sect;. 10. But it is time to my own &s;tory. &mdash;While I lodged at <HI>Curl</HI>'s, two Iri&s;h gentlemen came to &s;ee me, <HI>Jemmy King</HI> an attorney, and that famous ma&s;ter in chancery, who debauched <HI>Nelly Hayden,</HI> the beauty, and kept her &s;everal years. I knew the&s;e men were as great rakes as ever lived, and had no notion of religion; that they were devoted to plea&s;ure, and cha&s;ed away every &s;ober thought and apprehen&s;ion by company, by empty, vicious, and unmanly plea&s;ures: The voice of the monitor was lo&s;t, in the confu&s;ed noi&s;e and tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions: but I thought they had honour at the bottom, according to the common notion of it. I never imagined they were &s;harpers, nor knew, that being ruined in <HI>Ireland,</HI> they came over to live by a gaming table. The <HI>Doctor</HI> e&s;pecially, I thought was above ever becoming that kind of man, as he had a large e&s;tate, and the be&s;t education; always kept good company; and to appearance, was as fine a gentleman as ever was &s;een in the world. With the&s;e two I dined, and after dinner, they brought me, as it were, out of curio&s;ity, to a gaming table, they had
<PB N="403" REF="418">by accident di&s;covered, where there was a bank kept by men of the greate&s;t honour, who played quite fair, and by hazarding a few guineas, I might perhaps, as they did, come off with &s;ome hundreds.</P>
<P>At entring the room, I &s;aw about twenty well-dre&s;t men &s;itting round a table, on which lay a va&s;t heap of gold. We all began to play, and for two or three hours, I did win &s;ome hundreds of pounds: the Doctor and the other cheat, his friend, &s;eemed to lo&s;e a large &s;um; but before morning they won it all back from me, with a great deal more; and I not only lo&s;t what I had got then, but, excepting a few pounds, what I was worth in the world; the thou&s;ands I had gained by my &s;everal wives. I had &s;old their e&s;tates, and lodged the money in my banker's hands. The villains round this table got it all, and my two Iri&s;hmen were not to be &s;een. They di&s;appeared, and left me madly playing away my all. I heard no more of them, till I was told &s;everal years after, that they were in the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> among other outlawed, aban|doned, wicked men; where they drank night and day, according to the cu&s;tom of the place, and lived in defiance of God and man. There the&s;e two <HI>advocates of impiety</HI> dwelt for &s;ome time, and died as they had lived; enemies to all good principles, and friends to a general corruption.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="419">
As to the well-dre&s;t company round the table, they went off one by one, and left me all alone to the bitter thought, which led me to what I was &s;ome hours before, by what I then found my&s;elf to be. I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted. What had I to do with play, (I &s;aid)? I wanted nothing. And now by vil|lains, with a &s;ett of dice that would deceive the devil, I am undone. By &s;harpers and fal&s;e dice I have &s;at to be ruined. The re|flexion numb'd my &s;en&s;es for &s;ome time: and then I &s;tarted, was wild, and raved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Curl</HI>'s &s;cheme to carry off an heire&s;s, which I did in a &s;ucce&s;sful manner.</NOTE>&sect;. 11. This tran&s;action made me very thoughtful, and I &s;at within for &s;everal days, thinking which way to turn. <HI>Curl</HI> &s;aw I was perplexed, and on his a&s;king me if I had met with any misfortune, I told him the whole ca&s;e; that I had but one hundred pounds left, and reque&s;ted he would advi&s;e me what I had be&s;t do. To do ju&s;tice to every one, <HI>Curl</HI> &s;eemed deeply concerned, and after &s;ome &s;ilence, as we &s;at over a bottle at a Coffee-hou&s;e, he bid me take notice of an old gentleman, who was not far from us. That is <HI>Dunk</HI> the <HI>mi&s;er,</HI> who lives in a wood about 20 miles off. He has one daughter, the fine&s;t creature in the univer&s;e, and who is to &s;ucceed to his great e&s;tate, whether he will or not; it being &s;o &s;ettled at his marri|age;
<PB N="405" REF="420">but he confines her &s;o much in the coun|try, and u&s;es her &s;o cruelly every way, that I believe &s;he would run away with any hone&s;t young fellow, who could find means to ad|dre&s;s her. Know then (continued <HI>Curl</HI>) that I &s;erve Mr. <HI>Dunk</HI> with paper, pens, ink, wax, pamphlets, and every thing he wants in my way. Once a quarter of a year, I generally go to his country-hou&s;e with &s;uch things, as he is glad to &s;ee me &s;ometimes; or if I can|not go my&s;elf, I &s;end them by &s;ome other hand. Next week I am to forward &s;ome things to him, and if you will take them, I will write a line by you to Mi&s;s his daughter, recommend you to her for a hu&s;band, as one &s;he may depend on for honour and truth. She knows I am her friend, and who can tell, but &s;he may go off with you. She will have a thou&s;and a year, when the wretch her fa|ther dies, if he &s;hould leave his per&s;onal e&s;tate another way.</P>
<P>This thought plea&s;ed me much, and at the appointed time, away I went to Mr. <HI>Dunk</HI>'s country-hou&s;e with a wallet full of things, and delivered <HI>Curl</HI>'s letter to Mi&s;s. As &s;oon as &s;he had read it, I began my addre&s;s, and in the be&s;t manner I could, made her an offer of my &s;ervice, to deliver her from the tyrant her father. I gave her an account of a little farm I had on the borders of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> a purcha&s;e I had made, on ac|count
<PB N="406" REF="421">of the charms of the ground, and a &s;mall pretty lodge which &s;tood in the middle of it, by a clump of old trees, near a mur|muring &s;tream; that if &s;he plea&s;ed, I would take her to that &s;weet, &s;ilent &s;pot, and enable her to live in peace; with contentment and tran|quility of mind; tho' far away from the &s;plen|dors and honours of the world: and con&s;idering, that a chri&s;tian is not to conform to the world, or to the pomps and vanities of it; its grand cu&s;toms and u&s;ages; its dre&s;s and entries; its &s;tage repre&s;entations and ma&s;querades, as they mini&s;ter to vice, and tend to debauch the manners; but are to look upon our&s;elves as beings of another world, and to form our minds with the&s;e &s;piritual principles; it fol|lows then, I think, that a plea&s;ing country &s;ituation for a happy pair mu&s;t be grateful enough. There peace and love and mode&s;ty may be be&s;t pre&s;erved; the truth and gravity of our religion be &s;trictly maintained; and every lawful and innocent enjoyment be for ever the delights of life. Away from the idle modes of the world; perpetual love and un|mixed joys may be our portion, through the whole of our exi&s;tence here; and the in|ward principles of the heart be ever laudable and pure. So will our happine&s;s as mortals be &s;table,&mdash;&s;ubject to no mixture or change; and when called away from this lower hemi|&s;phere, have nothing to fear, as <HI>we u&s;ed this

<P>The charming <HI>Agnes</HI> &s;eemed not a little &s;urprized at what I had &s;aid, and after look|ing at me very earne&s;tly for a minute or two, told me, &s;he would give me an an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Curl</HI>'s letter in le&s;s than half an hour, which was all &s;he could &s;ay at pre&s;ent, and with it I returned to give him an account of the reception I had.

<P>To this <HI>Curl</HI> replied in a circum&s;tantial manner, and vouched very largely for me. I delivered his letter the next morning, when I went with &s;ome acts of parliament to old <HI>Dunk,</HI> and I found the beauty, his daughter, in a ro&s;y bower;&mdash;<HI>Simplex munditiis,</HI> neat and clean as po&s;&s;ible in the mo&s;t genteel undre&s;s; and her per&s;on &s;o va&s;tly fine, her face &s;o va&s;tly charming; that I could not but repeat the lines of <HI>Otway,</HI>&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Man when created fir&s;t wander'd up and down,</L>

<L>But when a heav'n-born maid, like you appear'd,</L>
<L>Strange plea&s;ures fill'd his &s;oul, unloos'd his tongue,</L>
<L>And his fir&s;t talk was love.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>A deal I &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion: we became well acquainted that day, as her father had
<PB N="409" REF="424">got a di&s;order that obliged him to keep his bed, and by the time I had vi&s;ited her a month longer, under various pretences of bu&s;ine&s;s invented by the ingenious <HI>Curl, Agnes</HI> agreed to go off with me, and commit her&s;elf intirely to my care and protection: But before I relate this tran&s;action, I think it proper to give my readers the picture of this lady; and then an apology for her flying away with me, with whom &s;he was but a month acquainted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pic|ture of Mi&s;s <HI>Dunk.</HI></NOTE><HI>Agnes</HI> in her per&s;on was neither tall nor thin, but almo&s;t both, young and lovely, graceful and commanding: She in&s;pired a re&s;pect, and compelled the beholder to ad|mire and love and reverence her. Her voice was melodious; her words quite charming; and every look and motion to her advantage. Ta&s;te was the characteri&s;tic of her under|&s;tanding: Her &s;entiments were refined: And a &s;en&s;ibility appeared in every feature of her face. She could talk on various &s;ubjects, and comprehended them, which is what few &s;peakers do: but with the fine&s;t di&s;cernment, &s;he was timid, and &s;o diffident of her opi|nion, that &s;he often concealed the fine&s;t thoughts under a &s;eeming &s;implicity of &s;oul. This was vi&s;ible to a hearer, and the decency of ignorance added a new beauty to her cha|racter. In &s;hort, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellence, &s;he

<P>In &s;um, exclu&s;ive of her fine under&s;tand|ing, in her dre&s;s, and in her behaviour, &s;he was &s;o extremely plea&s;ing, &s;o va&s;tly agree|able and delightful, that &s;he ever brought to my remembrance, when I beheld her, the <HI>Corinna</HI> de&s;cribed in the beautiful lines of <HI>Tibullus:</HI></P>

Such was the beautiful <HI>Agnes,</HI> who went off with me, and in &s;o doing acted well and wi&s;ely, I affirm, on her taking me only for an hone&s;t man; for there is no more obedi|ence due from a daughter to her father, when he becomes an unrelenting oppre&s;&s;or, than there is from a &s;ubject to an Engli&s;h king, when the monarch acts contrary to the con|&s;titution. Pa&s;&s;ive obedience is as much non|&s;en&s;e in a private family, as in the govern|ment of the prince. The parent, like the king, mu&s;t be a nur&s;ing father, a rational humane &s;overeign, and &s;o long all &s;ervice and obedi|ence are due. But if, like the prince, he be|comes a tyrant, deprives his daughter of her natural rights and liberties; will not allow her the ble&s;&s;ings of life, but keep her in chains and mi&s;ery; &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and her ju&s;t claim to the comforts of exi&s;tence and a rational freedom, give her a right to change her &s;itu|ation, and better her condition. If &s;he can have bread, &s;erenity, and freedom, peace and little, with an hone&s;t man, &s;he is ju&s;t to her&s;|elf in going off with &s;uch a deliverer. Rea&s;on and revelation will acquit her.</P>
<P>Thus ju&s;tly thought Mi&s;s <HI>Dunk,</HI> and there|fore with me &s;he fled at midnight. We met within half a mile of her father's hou&s;e, by the &s;ide of an antient wood, and a running &s;tream, which had a plea&s;ing effect, as it hap|pened to be a bright moon&s;hine. With her
<PB N="412" REF="427">foot in my hand, I lifted her into her &s;addle, and as our hor&s;es were excellent, we rid many miles in a few hours. By eight in the morning, we were out of the reach of old <HI>Dunk,</HI> and at the &s;ign of the <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> a lone hou&s;e in <HI>E&s;ur-vale,</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> we break|fa&s;ted very joyfully. The charming <HI>Agnes</HI> &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with the expedition, and &s;aid a thou&s;and things that rendered the jour|ney delightful. Twelve days we travelled in a fulne&s;s of delights, happy beyond de&s;crip|tion, and the thirteenth arrived at a village not far from my little habitation. Here we de&s;igned to be married two days after, when we had re&s;ted, as there was a church and a par&s;on in the town, and then ride on to <HI>Foley</HI> farm in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> as my &s;mall &s;pot was called, and there &s;it down in peace and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>But the &s;econd day, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to the nuptial ceremony, to crown my life with unutterable bli&s;s, and make me beyond all mankind happy, the lovely <HI>Agnes</HI> fell ill of a fever. A &s;en&s;e of weight and oppre&s;&s;ion di&s;covered the inflammation within, and was attended with &s;harp and pungent pains. The blood could not pa&s;s off as it ought in the cour&s;e of circulation, and the whole ma&s;s was in a violent fluctuation and motion. In a word, &s;he died in a few days, and as &s;he had reque&s;ted, if it came to that, I laid her
<PB N="413" REF="428">out, and put her into the coffin my&s;elf. I kept her &s;even days, according to the cu&s;tom of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> and then in the dre&s;s of &s;orrow, followed her to the grave.&mdash;Thus was my plan of happine&s;s broken to pieces. I had given a roundne&s;s to a &s;y&s;tem of feli|city, and in the place of it, &s;aw death and hor|ror, and di&s;appointment before me.</P>
<P>What to do next I could not tell. One que&s;tion was, &s;hould I return to <HI>Orton-lodge,</HI> to my two young heire&s;&s;es? No: they want|ed two years of being at age.&mdash;Then, &s;hall I &s;tay at <HI>Foley-farm</HI> where I was, and turn hermit? No: I had no inclination yet to be|come a father of the de&s;arts.&mdash;Will you re|turn to <HI>London</HI> then, and &s;ee if fortune has any thing more in re&s;erve for you? This I liked be&s;t; and after &s;ix months deliberation on the thing, I left my farm in the care of an old woman, and &s;et out in the beginning of <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A winter night-&s;cene on the mountains of <HI>We&s;t|moreland.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 13. It was as fine a winter's morning as I had &s;een, which encouraged me to ven|ture among the <HI>Fells</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmoreland;</HI> but at noon the weather changed, and an even|ing very terrible came on. A little after three, it began to blow, rain, and &s;now very hard, and it was not long before it was very dark. We lo&s;t the way quite, and for three hours wandered about in as di&s;mal a night as ever
<PB N="414" REF="429">poor travellers had. The &s;torm rattled: The tempe&s;t howled: We could not &s;ee the hor&s;e's heads, and were almo&s;t dead with cold. We had nothing to expect but death, as we knew not which way to turn to any hou&s;e, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to remain alive till the day appeared. It was a di&s;mal &s;cene. But my time was not yet come, and when we had no ground to expect deliverance, the bea&s;ts of a &s;udden &s;topt, and <HI>Soto</HI> found we were at the gate of a walled yard. There he immediately made all the noi&s;e he could, and it was not long before a &s;ervant with a lantern came. He related our ca&s;e within, and had orders to admit us. He brought me into a common parlour, where there was a good fire, and I got dry things. The man brought me half a pint of hot alicant, and in about half an hour, I was alive and well again. On enquiring where I was, the foot|man told me, it was Doctor <HI>Stanvil</HI>'s hou&s;e; that his ma&s;ter and lady were above in the dining-room, with &s;ome company, and he had directions to light me up, when I had changed my cloaths, and was recovered.

This has a&s;toni&s;hed me, as I &s;tood behind your chair at &s;upper, looking full at her; and I ob&s;erved &s;he looked at me once or twice. What to &s;ay to all this, I know not; but I will make all the enquiry I can among the &s;ervants, as to the time and manner of her coming here, and let you know to-morrow, what I have been able to collect in relation to her. In the mean time, be advis'd by me, Sir, tho' I am but a poor fellow, and think no more of the matter to the lo&s;s of your night's re&s;t. We have had a wonderful deliverance from death by getting into this hou&s;e, I am &s;ure, and we ought to lie down with thankfulne&s;s and joy, without fretting our&s;elves awake for a woman, or any trifling incident that could befall. Be|&s;ide, &s;he is now another man's property, however it came to pa&s;s, and it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with your character to think any more of her.

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Finn</HI>'s ac|count of Mrs. <HI>Stan|vil,</HI> which he had from the &s;ervants.</NOTE>Betimes the next morning, <HI>Finn</HI> was with me, and on my a&s;king what news, he &s;aid, he had heard &s;omething from all the &s;ervants, and more particularly had got the following account from the doctor's own man:&mdash;that Dr. <HI>Stanvil</HI> had a &s;mall lodge within three miles of the hou&s;e we were in, and retired there &s;ometimes to be more alone, than he could be in the re&s;idence we were at; that this lodge was a mere repo&s;itory of curio&s;ities, in the middle of a garden full of all the herbs and plants that grew in every country of the world, and in one chamber of this hou&s;e was a great number of &s;keletons, which the doctor had made him&s;elf; for it was his wont to procure bodies from the &s;urrounding church-yards, by men he kept in pay for the purpo&s;e, and cut them up him&s;elf at this lodge: that &s;ome of the&s;e dead were brought to him in hampers, and &s;ome in their cof|fins on light railed cars, as the ca&s;e required: that near &s;ix months ago, the la&s;t time the doctor was at this lodge, there was brought to him by his men the body of a young woman in her coffin, in order to a di&s;&s;ection as u&s;ual, and the bones being wired; but as it lay on the back, on the great table he cuts up on, and the point of his knife at the pit of the &s;to|mach, to open the brea&s;t, he perceived a kind of motion in the &s;ubject, heard a &s;igh
<PB N="419" REF="434">&s;oon after, and looking up to the head &s;aw the eyes open and &s;hut again: that upon this, he laid down his knife, which had but ju&s;t &s;cratch'd the body, at the beginning of the <HI>linea alba,</HI> (as my informer called it) and helped him&s;elf to put it into a warm bed: that he took all po&s;&s;ible pains, by admini|&s;tering every thing he could think u&s;eful, to re&s;tore life, and was &s;o fortunate as to &s;et one of the fine&s;t women in the world on her feet again. As &s;he had no raiment but the &s;hroud which had been on her in the coffin, he got every thing belonging to dre&s;s that a woman of di&s;tinction could have occa&s;ion for, and in a few days time, &s;he &s;parkled before her pre|&s;erver in the brightne&s;s of an Ea&s;tern prince&s;s: He was quite charmed with the beauties of her per&s;on, and could not enough admire her uncommon under&s;tanding: He offered to marry her, to &s;ettle largely on her, and as &s;he was a &s;ingle woman, &s;he could not in gratitude refu&s;e the reque&s;t of &s;o generous a benefactor: My informer further related, that they have both lived in the greate&s;t happine&s;s ever &s;ince; and the doctor, who is one of the be&s;t of men, is continually &s;tudying how to add to the felicities of her every day: that he offered to take her up to <HI>London</HI> to pa&s;s the winters there, but this &s;he refu&s;ed, and de&s;ired &s;he might remain where &s;he was in the country, as it was really mo&s;t agree|able

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A reflexion on Mi&s;s <HI>Dunk</HI>'s marrying Dr. <HI>Stan|vil.</HI></NOTE>This account made the thing quite plain to me. And to judge impartially, con&s;ider|ing the whole ca&s;e, I could neither blame the lovely <HI>Agnes</HI> for marrying the doctor, nor condemn her for pretending to be a &s;tranger to me. She was fairly dead and buried, and all connexion between us was at an end of cour&s;e, as there had been no marriage, nor contract of marriage. And as to reviving the affair, and renewing the tenderne&s;s which had exi&s;ted, it could an&s;wer no other end than producing unhappine&s;s, as &s;he was then Mrs. <HI>Stanvil,</HI> in a decent and happy &s;ituation. And further, in re&s;pect of her marrying the doctor &s;o &s;oon after her &s;eparation from me, it was certainly the wi&s;e&s;t thing &s;he could do, as &s;he had been &s;o intirely at his di&s;po&s;al, was without a &s;titch to cover her, and I in all probability, after burying her, being gone up to <HI>London,</HI> or in &s;ome place, where &s;he could never hear of me more; I might likewi&s;e have been married, if any thing advantageous had offered after laying her in the church-yard. And be&s;ide, &s;he neither knew the place &s;he fell &s;ick in, nor the country the doctor removed her to, as &s;oon as ever he could get any cloaths to put on her. So that, naked and friendle&s;s as &s;he was, without any money, and ignorant of
<PB N="421" REF="436">what became of me; without a po&s;&s;ibility of informing her&s;elf; I could not but acquit her. I even admired her conduct, and re|&s;olved &s;o far to imitate her, in regard to the general happine&s;s, that nothing &s;hould appear in my behaviour, which could incline any one to think, I had ever &s;een her before the night the tempe&s;t drove me to her hou&s;e. I was vexed, I own, to lo&s;e her. But that could be no rea&s;on for making a &s;en&s;ele&s;s uproar, that could do nothing but mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>As compo&s;ed then as I could be, I went down to breakfa&s;t, on a &s;ervant's letting me know they waited for me, and found the &s;ame company, who had &s;o lately parted to &s;lumber, all quite alive and chearful, ea&s;y and happy as mortals could be. At the reque&s;t of Dr. <HI>Stanvil,</HI> who was extremely civil, I &s;taid with them two months, and pa&s;&s;ed the time in a delightful conver&s;ation, inter|mixed with mu&s;ic, cards, and fea&s;ting.<NOTE PLACE="marg">My depar|ture from Dr. <HI>Stan|vil</HI>'s hou&s;e.</NOTE> With &s;adne&s;s I left them all, but e&s;pecially on ac|count of parting for ever with the late Mi&s;s <HI>Dunk.</HI> It was indeed for the plea&s;ure of looking at her, that I &s;taid &s;o long as I did at Dr. <HI>Stanvil</HI>'s; and when it came to an eter|nal &s;eparation, I felt that morning of my departure, an inward di&s;tre&s;s it is impo&s;&s;ible to give an idea of to another. It had &s;ome re&s;emblance (I imagine) of what the vi&s;io|naries call a dereliction; when they &s;ink from
<PB N="422" REF="437">exta&s;y to the black void of horror, by the &s;trength of fancy, and the unnacountable operation of the animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some ob|&s;ervations on Mrs. <HI>Stanvil</HI>'s coming to life again, after being taken out of the grave.</NOTE>Here, before I proceed, I think I ought to remove &s;ome objections that may be made again&s;t my relation of Mrs. <HI>Stanvil</HI>'s coming to life again, and her being brought from the couch of la&s;ting night to a bridal bed. It is not ea&s;y to believe, that after I &s;eemed certain &s;he was dead, and kept her the pro|per number of days before interment; &s;aw her lie the cold wan &s;ubject for a con&s;ider|able time, and then let down into the grave; yet from thence &s;he &s;hould come forth, and now be the de&s;ire of a hu&s;band's eyes. This is a hard account &s;ure. But neverthele&s;s, it is a fact. As to my being mi&s;taken, no le&s;s a man than Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> thought Colonel <HI>Town|&s;end</HI> dead: (See his <HI>Nervous Ca&s;es:</HI>) And that &s;everal have lived for many years, after they had been laid in the tomb, is a thing too certain, and well-known, to be denied. In <HI>Bayle</HI>'s dictionary, there is the hi&s;tory of a lady of quality, belonging to the court of <HI>Catharine de Medicis,</HI> who was brought from the church vault, where &s;he had been forty-eight hours, and afterwards became the mo|ther of &s;everal children, on her marriage with the Marquis <HI>D'Auvergne.</HI>&mdash;The learned Dr. <HI>Connor,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Poland,</HI> gives us a very wonderful relation of a gentleman's re|viving
<PB N="423" REF="438">in that country, after he had been &s;eem|ingly dead for near a fortnight; and adds a very curious di&s;&s;ertation on the nature of &s;uch reco|veries. The ca&s;e of <HI>Dun Scotus,</HI> who was found out of his coffin, on the &s;teps going down to the vault he was depo&s;ited in, and leaning on his elbow, is full to my purpo&s;e. And I can affirm from my own knowledge, that a gentleman of my acquaintance, a worthy excellent man, was buried alive, and found not only much brui&s;ed and torn, on opening his coffin, but turned on one &s;ide. This many &s;till living can atte&s;t as well as I. The rea&s;on of opening the grave again, was his dying of a high fever in the ab&s;ence of his lady, who was in a di&s;tant county from him; and on her return, three days after he was buried, would have a &s;ight of him, as &s;he had been extremely fond of him. His face was &s;adly broke, and his hands hurt in &s;triving to force up the lid of the coffin. The lady was &s;o affected with the di&s;|mal &s;ight, that &s;he never held up her head af|ter, and died in a few weeks. I could likewi&s;e add another extraordinary ca&s;e of a man who was hang'd, and to all appearance was quite dead, yet three days after his execution reco|vered as they were going to cut him up. &mdash;How the&s;e things happen, is not ea&s;y to account for; but happen they do &s;ometimes.

<PB N="431" REF="446">with for &s;helter: but at la&s;t we came to the thatched habitation of a publican, and I thought it a very comfortable place: We had bread and bacon, and good ale for &s;upper, and in our circum&s;tances, it &s;eemed a delici|ous meal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Au|thor is in|formed of an old ac|quaintance of his, who lived not far from the inn he arrived at.</NOTE>&sect;. 3. This man informed me, that about a mile from his habitation, in the middle of the wood, there dwelt an <HI>old phy&s;ician,</HI> one Dr. <HI>Fitzgibbons,</HI> an Iri&s;h gentleman, who had one very pretty daughter, a &s;en&s;ible wo|man, to whom he was able to give a good fortune, if a man to both their liking ap|peared; but as no &s;uch one had as yet come in their way, my landlord advi&s;ed me to try the adventure, and he would furni&s;h me with an excu&s;e for going to the doctor's hou&s;e.

I &s;aved his &s;on's life, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when he was upon the brink of de&s;truction, and the old gentleman was not only then as thankful as it was po&s;&s;ible for a man to be, in return for the good I had done him, at the hazard of my own life; but a&s;&s;ured me, a thou&s;and times over, that if ever it was in his power to return my kindne&s;s, he would be my friend to the utmo&s;t of his ability. He mu&s;t ever remember, with the greate&s;t gratitude, the benefit I had
<PB N="432" REF="447">&s;o generou&s;ly conferred on him and his. All this came full into my mind, and I deter|mined to vi&s;it the old gentleman in the morning.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. Next day, as I had re&s;olved, I went to pay my re&s;pects to Dr. <HI>Fitzgibbons,</HI> who remembered me perfectly well, was mo&s;t heartily glad to &s;ee me, and received me in the mo&s;t affectionate manner. He immediately began to repeat his obligations to me, for the deliverance I had given his &s;on, and that if it was in his power to be of &s;er|vice to me in <HI>England,</HI> he would leave no|thing undone that was po&s;&s;ible for him to do, to befriend me.<NOTE N="(19)" PLACE="foot"><P>The ca&s;e was this. As I was returning one &s;ummer's evening from <HI>Tallow-Hills,</HI> where I had been to &s;ee a young lady, (mentioned in the beginning of my fir&s;t volume,) I &s;aw in a <HI>deep glen</HI> before me two men en|gaged; a black of an enormous &s;ize, who fought with one of tho&s;e large broad &s;words which they call in <HI>Ireland, Andrew Ferraro;</HI> and a little thin man with a drawn rapier. The <HI>white</HI> man I perceived was no match for the <HI>black,</HI> and mu&s;t have peri&s;hed very &s;oon, as he had received &s;everal wounds, if I had not ha&s;tned up to his relief. I knew him to be my acquaintance, young <HI>Fitz|gibbons,</HI> my neighbour in the &s;ame &s;quare of the college that I lived in; and immediately drawing an excellent Spani&s;h tuck I always wore, took the <HI>Moor</HI> to my&s;elf, <HI>Fitzgibbons</HI> not being able to &s;tand any longer; and a glorious battle en&s;ued. As I was a ma&s;ter at the &s;mall &s;word in tho&s;e days, I had the advantage of the <HI>black</HI> by my weapon, (as the broad &s;word is but a poor de|fence
<PB N="433" REF="448">again&s;t a rapier,) and gave him three wounds for every &s;light one I received: But at la&s;t he cut me quite through the left collar-bone, and in return, I was in his va&s;t body a moment after. This dropt the <HI>robber,</HI> who had been a trumpeter to a regiment of hor&s;e; and <HI>Fitzgibbons</HI> and I were brought, by &s;ome people pa&s;&s;ing that way, to his father's hou&s;e at <HI>Dolfins-barn,</HI> a village about a mile from the &s;pot where this affair happened. A &s;urgeon was &s;ent for, and we recovered in a few weeks time; but my <HI>collar-bone</HI> was much more trouble&s;ome to me, than the wounds <HI>Fitzgibbons</HI> had were to him, tho' he lo&s;t much more blood. This was the ground of the obligation the doctor mentioned in his conver|&s;ation with me.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="432" REF="447">He told me, that
<PB N="433" REF="448">darling &s;on of his, who&s;e life I had &s;aved, was an eminent phy&s;ician at the court of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> where he lived in the greate&s;t opu|lence and reputation: and as he owed his exi&s;tence as &s;uch to me, his father could never be grateful enough in return. Can I any way &s;erve you, Sir? Have you been for|tunate or unfortunate, &s;ince your living in <HI>England?</HI> Are you married or unmarried? I have a daughter by a &s;econd wife, and if you are not yet engaged, will give her to you, with a good fortune, and in two years time; if you will &s;tudy phy&s;ic here, under my di|rection, will enable you to begin to practice, and get money as I have done in this coun|try. I have &s;o true a &s;en&s;e of that generous act you did to &s;ave my &s;on, that I will with plea&s;ure do any thing in my power that can contribute to your happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="434" REF="449">
To this I replied, by thanking the doctor for his friendly offers, and letting him know, that &s;ince my coming to <HI>England</HI> &s;everal years ago, which was occa&s;ioned by a difference be|tween my father and me; I had met with &s;eve|ral turns of fortune, good and bad, and was at pre&s;ent but in a very middling way; having only a little &s;pot among the mountains of <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> with a cottage and garden on it, and three or four bea&s;ts, which I found by accident without an owner, as I travelled through that uninhabited land; and a &s;mall farm of fifty acres with &s;ome &s;tock, on the borders of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> which I got by a de|cea&s;ed wife. This, with about fifty guineas in my pur&s;e, was my all at pre&s;ent; and I was going up to <HI>London,</HI> to try if I could meet with any thing fortunate in that place; but that, &s;ince he was plea&s;ed to make me &s;uch generous offers, I would &s;top, &s;tudy phy&s;ic as he propo&s;ed, and accept the great honour he did me in offering me his daugh|ter for a wife. I told him likewi&s;e very fairly and hone&s;tly, that I had been rich by three or four marriages &s;ince my being in this country; but that I was unfortunately taken in at a gaming-table, by the means of two Iri&s;h gentlemen he knew very well, and there lo&s;t all; which vext me the more, as I really do not love play:&mdash;that as to my fa|ther, I had little to expect from him, tho'
<PB N="435" REF="450">he had a great e&s;tate, as our difference was about religion; (which kind of di&s;putes always have the cruelle&s;t tendency;) and the wife you know he married, a low cunning woman, does all &s;he can to maintain the variance, and keep up his anger to me, that her nephew may do the better on my ruin. I have not writ to him &s;ince my being in <HI>England:</HI> Nor have I met with any one who could give me any account of the family. This is my ca&s;e, Sir.</P>
<P>And what (Dr. <HI>Fitzgibbons</HI> &s;aid) is this fine religious di&s;pute, which has made your father fall out with a &s;on he was once &s;o fond of?&mdash;It was about <HI>trinity in unity,</HI> Sir: a thing I have often heard your &s;on argue again&s;t by le&s;&s;ons he had from you, as he in|formed me. My father is as <HI>orthodox</HI> as <HI>Gre|gory Nazienzen,</HI> among the antient fathers, or <HI>Trapp</HI> and <HI>Potter, Web&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Waterland,</HI> among the modern doctors; and when he found out, that I was become an <HI>unitarian,</HI> and renounced his <HI>religion</HI> of <HI>three Gods,</HI> the horrible <HI>creed</HI> of <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> and all the de|&s;picable explications of his admired divines, on that &s;ubject; &mdash; that I in&s;i&s;ted, that not|with&s;tanding all the &s;ubtle inventions of learned men, through the whole chri&s;tian world, yet God Almighty hath not appointed him&s;elf to be wor&s;hipped by precept or ex|ample in any one in&s;tance in his holy word,
<PB N="436" REF="451">under the character of Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; &mdash; that the wor&s;hip of three per&s;ons and one God is expre&s;ly contrary to the &s;olemn determination of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles;&mdash; and in numbers of in&s;tances in the New Te&s;tament it is declared, that the one God and Father of all is the only &s;u|preme object, to whom all religious wor&s;hip &s;hould be directed:&mdash; that for the&s;e rea&s;ons, I renounced the received doctrine of a co-equal trinity, and believed our great and learned divines, who laboured to prevent people from &s;eeing the truth as it is in Je&s;us, would be in &s;ome tribulation at Chri&s;t's tribunal; where they are to appear &s;tripped of all worldly ho|nours, dignities, and preferments, poor, naked, wretched mortals, and to an&s;wer for their &s;up|plement to the go&s;pel, in an invented <HI>here&s;y</HI> of <HI>three Gods.</HI> &mdash;When my father heard the&s;e things, and &s;aw the religious ca&s;e of his &s;on, his pa&s;&s;ion was very great. He forbid me his table, and ordered me to &s;hift for my&s;elf. He renounced me, as I had done the <HI>triune God.</HI></P>
<P>The doctor wondered not a little at the account I had given him, (as my father was reckoned a man of great abilities,) and tak|ing me by the hand, &s;aid, I had acted mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly: that what lo&s;t me my father's affection, was the very thing that ought to have
<PB N="437" REF="452">induced him to erect a &s;tatue to my honour in his garden: &mdash; that &s;ince I was plea&s;ed to accept of his offer, his friend&s;hip I might depend on:&mdash; that if I would, I &s;hould begin the next day the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic under his direction, and at the end of two years, he would give me his daughter, who was not yet quite twenty.</P>

The choice of dre&s;s was no part of <HI>Julia</HI>'s care, but by the neglect of it &s;he became irre&s;i&s;tible. In her countenance there ever appeared a bewitching mixture of &s;en&s;ibility and gaiety, and in her &s;oul, by conver&s;e we di&s;covered that genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s were the fir&s;t principles of her mind. To truth and virtue &s;he was inwardly devoted, and at the bottom of her heart, tho' hard to di&s;co|ver it, her main bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve God, and fit her&s;elf for eternity. In &s;um, &s;he was one of the fine&s;t originals that ever appeared among womankind, peculiar in perfections which cannot be de&s;cribed; and &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly charming in an attractive &s;weetne&s;s, a natu|ral gaiety, and a &s;triking negligence, a fine under&s;tanding, and the mo&s;t humane heart; that I found it impo&s;&s;ible to know her with|out being in love with her: Her power to plea&s;e was exten&s;ive indeed.

<P><HI>Chemi&s;try</HI> was the next thing my director bid me look into, and to this purpo&s;e I peru&s;ed <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s <HI>Elementa chemiae:</HI> and <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s <HI>Ob&s;ervationes phy&s;ico-chemiae:</HI> The&s;e afford as much chemi&s;try as a young phy&s;ician need &s;et out with: but as books alone give but an imperfect conception, I performed mo&s;t of the common operations in the <HI>portable furnace of Becher.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>materia medica</HI> in the next place had my attention, that is, tho&s;e animal, vegeta|ble, and fo&s;&s;il &s;ub&s;tances, which are u&s;ed to prevent, cure, or palliate di&s;ea&s;es. And in order to know the names of all the drugs,
<PB N="443" REF="458">their hi&s;tory, the adulterations they are &s;ub|ject to, their virtues, their do&s;e, their manner of u&s;ing them, and the cautions which they require, &mdash; to get a &s;ufficient knowledge of this kind, I looked into <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s <HI>materia medica,</HI> and made a collection of the <HI>materia</HI> at the &s;ame time, that I might conceive and remember what I read.</P>
<P><HI>Pharmacy,</HI> or the art of preparing and com|pounding medicines, was the next thing I endeavoured to be a ma&s;ter of. And that I might know how to exalt their virtues, to obviate their ill qualities, and to make them le&s;s nau&s;eous, I read to this purpo&s;e, <HI>Quincy</HI>'s <HI>pharmaceutical lectures</HI> and <HI>di&s;pen&s;atory:</HI> and took care to be well ver&s;ed in all the <HI>pharma|copoeia</HI>'s, tho&s;e of <HI>London, Edinburgh, Paris, Boerhaave, Bate,</HI> and <HI>Fuller.</HI> And I read very carefully <HI>Gaubin</HI>'s <HI>methodus prae&s;cribendi.</HI> This gave me the materials, and taught me the form of pre&s;cribing.</P>
<P><HI>Anatomy</HI> I &s;tudied next, that is, the art of dividing the &s;everal parts of a body, &s;o as to know their &s;ize, figure, &s;ituation, connexions, and make. I began with <HI>Drake</HI> and <HI>Keil,</HI> and then read over <HI>Win&s;low.</HI> I had likewi&s;e open before me at the &s;ame time, at my entrance upon this &s;tudy, a good &s;et of plates, the tables of <HI>Eu&s;tachius</HI> and <HI>Cooper,</HI> and turned them carefully over as I read. The doctor then &s;hewed me how to di&s;&s;ect,
<PB N="444" REF="459">but chiefly by the direction of a book called the <HI>Culter Anatomicus</HI> of <HI>Michel Ly&s;e|rus,</HI> ou methode courte, facile, &amp; claire de di&s;&s;equer les corps humaines.

<P>Here before I proceed, I will mention a very curious ca&s;e, which occurred in my di&s;|&s;ecting the body I have &s;poken of. It was as remarkable an example of a preternatural &s;tructure as ever appeared.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e of a young wo|man with a double vagina.</NOTE> In cutting her up, there was found <HI>two vaginas,</HI> and a right and left <HI>uterus.</HI> Each <HI>uterus</HI> had its corre|&s;ponding <HI>vagina,</HI> and the <HI>uteri</HI> and the <HI>vaginae</HI> lay parallel to each other; there was only one <HI>ovarium;</HI> but two perfect <HI>hymens.</HI> The <HI>labia</HI> &s;tretched &s;o as to take in the <HI>anus,</HI> ter|minating beyond it; and as they were in large ridges, and well armed, the whole had a formidable appearance.

Mo&s;t certainly there might be one conception upon the back of another at different times; therefore, I &s;hould not chu&s;e to marry a woman with two <HI>vaginas,</HI> if it was po&s;&s;ible to know it before wedlock.</P>
<P>But to proceed, &mdash; The next things I read, were the <HI>In&s;titutes of Medicine,</HI> that is, &s;uch books as treat of the oeconomy and con|trivance
<PB N="446" REF="461">of nature in adapting the parts to their &s;everal u&s;es. The books purely <HI>phy|&s;iological,</HI> are, <HI>Keil</HI>'s <HI>Tentamina. Sanctorii aphori&s;mi.

<P>The 2d part of the In&s;titutes is the <HI>Art of pre&s;erving &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as the body, in an order fit for the exerci&s;e of its functions as long as po&s;&s;ible.</HI> The 3d part is <HI>pathology,</HI> which teaches the different manners in which di&s;ea|&s;es happen; and the various cau&s;es of the&s;e di&s;orders, with their attendants and con&s;e|quences: The 4th part is the <HI>doctrine of &s;igns,</HI> by which a judgment is formed of the &s;ound or bad &s;tate of the animal: And the 5th is <HI>Therapentica,</HI> that is, the means and method of re&s;toring &s;anity to a di&s;tempered body. Treati&s;es on all the&s;e matters, are what we call <HI>in&s;titutions of phy&s;ic,</HI> and in relation, to the four la&s;t mentioned, the be&s;t books are, <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s <HI>Sy&s;tema medicinoe rationalis,</HI> and <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s <HI>In&s;titutions, with his lectures upon them.</HI> The&s;e books I read with great atten|tion, and found them &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="462">
Being in&s;tituted in this manner, I turned next to the practical writers, and read the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es and their cure from ob|&s;ervations of nature. This is called <HI>patho|logia particularis,</HI> and is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of a phy&s;ician. All that has been &s;aid is only preparatory to this &s;tudy. Here then I fir&s;t very carefully read the authors who have written a &s;y&s;tem of all di&s;ea&s;es; and then, &s;uch writers as have con&s;idered particular ca&s;es. The be&s;t &s;y&s;tem writers are <HI>Boer|haave</HI>'s <HI>aphori&s;ms and comment. Hoffman</HI>'s <HI>pathologia particularis;</HI> being the la&s;t part of his <HI>Sy&s;tema medicinae.

<PB N="448" REF="463">of the mo&s;t curious and u&s;eful things, e&s;pecial|ly the repre&s;entations of nature; and refre&s;hed my memory by often looking into my note|book. Every thing taken from nature is valu|able. Hypothe&s;is is entertaining rather than u&s;eful.</P>
<P>And when I was reading the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es in the authors I have ju&s;t mentioned, I looked into the antient Greek and Latin medical writers; for all their merit lies in this kind of hi&s;tory. Their pharmacy and anatomy is good for nothing. They &s;carce knew any thing of the human bodies, but from the di&s;&s;ections of other animals, took their de&s;criptions. The great <HI>Ve&s;alius</HI> in the beginning of the 16th century, was the fir&s;t that taught phy&s;icians to &s;tudy nature in di&s;|&s;ecting human bodies; which was then con&s;idered by the church as a kind of &s;acri|lege.<NOTE N="(20)" PLACE="foot"><P>When <HI>Ve&s;alius</HI> began to di&s;&s;ect human bodies, he was con&s;idered by the people as an impious cruel man; and before he could practice publicly, he was ob|liged to get a deci&s;ion in his favour from the <HI>Salamanca divines.</HI> C'e&s;t ce qui engagea <HI>Charles</HI> V. de faire faire une con&s;ultation aux theologiens de <HI>Salamanque,</HI> pour &s;avoir &s;i en con&s;cience on pouvoit di&s;&s;equer un corps humain, pour en conno&icirc;tre la &s;tructure.

<PB N="449" REF="464">the admiration of all men of &s;cience: And a little after, he made a pre&s;ent of the fir&s;t <HI>&s;keleton</HI> the world ever &s;aw, to the univer&s;ity of <HI>Bale;</HI> where it is &s;till to be &s;een. This great man, <HI>Andrew Ve&s;al,</HI> was born the la&s;t of April, 1512; and in the 58th year of his age, October 15, 1564, he was &s;hipwreck'd on the i&s;le of <HI>Zante,</HI> and in the de&s;erts there was fami&s;hed to death.

<PB N="448" REF="463">As to <HI>chemi&s;try,</HI> they had no
<PB N="449" REF="464">notion of it. It was not heard of till &s;ome hundred years after the late&s;t of them. In botany they had made little progre&s;s. In &s;hort, as they knew little of botany;&mdash;no|thing of chemi&s;try; as their &s;y&s;tems of na|tural philo&s;ophy and anatomy were fal&s;e and unnatural, (and it is upon anatomy and na|tural philo&s;ophy, that phy&s;iology or the u&s;e of the parts is founded,) we can expect nothing from the antients upon the&s;e heads, but mere imaginations, or notions un&s;up|ported by ob&s;ervation or matter of fact. It is their hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es &s;upports their cha|racter. <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> in particular, excels all others on this head: but this great man was not perfect even in this. Knowledge in na|ture is the daughter of time and experience. Many notions of the animal oeconomy were then ab&s;urd; and if <HI>Hippocrates</HI> was too wi&s;e to act always up to his theory, yet he could not be intirely free from its influence.</P>
<P><PB N="450" REF="465">
The names of the antient original greek medical writers are, <HI>Hippocrates, Dio&s;corides, Aritaeus, Galen,</HI> and <HI>Alexander.</HI> The latin writers of phy&s;ic are, <HI>Cel&s;us, Scribonius Lar|gus, Caelius Aurelianus, Marcellus Empericus, Theodorus Pri&s;cianus,</HI> and <HI>Sextus Placitus.</HI> We have be&s;ides &s;everal <HI>collectors,</HI> as <HI>Oriba|&s;ius, Aetius, Paulus Aeginita,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Nicander,</HI> the medical poet; and the <HI>fragments</HI> of <HI>So|ranus, Rufus Ephe&s;ius, Zonorates, Vindicia|nus, Diocles Cary&s;tius, Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> and a few others: but all the&s;e may be looked into af|terwards.

<P>As to the latin medical writers, <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Caelius Aurelianus</HI> only, are worth read|ing. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> lived in the latter end of the reign of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and is admirable for the purity of his latin, and the elegance of his &s;en&s;e.

<P> The rea&s;on (an&s;wered my in&s;tructor) is, becau&s;e they had not a true idea of what they had &s;een. Surrounded by a confu&s;ion
<PB N="470" REF="485">of things as they pa&s;&s;ed on, they could not di&s;tinctly perceive what was done. The mi&s;ts of ignorance and error ob&s;cured the pro|&s;pect as they journied on, and by that means, they were &s;ubject to mi&s;takes.

Safely they may travel where they will: In all times, and in all places they are &s;ecure, as their <HI>in|tegrity</HI> is their <HI>defence.</HI> Every where they live e&s;teemed and beloved by all. The <HI>female mon&s;ters</HI> I have mentioned, <HI>Grief, Trouble, Lu&s;t, Avarice,</HI> or <HI>Poverty,</HI> have now no power to hurt them; but as if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome vir|tuous drug, they can gra&s;p the viper, and defy de&s;truction.</P>

<P> Then lifting up his arm again, and pointing with his wand to a <HI>figure</HI> in the <HI>picture;</HI> that <HI>blind woman</HI> &s;tanding on a <HI>globe,</HI> as I told you before, is <HI>Fortune.</HI> The <HI>genius</HI> forbids us to tru&s;t her, or imagine her &s;miles will be la&s;ting happine&s;s. Rea&s;on is never concerned in what the does. It is Fortune &s;till; without principle &s;he acts, is arbitrary and capricious, and incon&s;iderately and ra&s;hly for ever proceeds. Regard not then her fa|vours, nor mind her frowns: But as &s;he gives and takes away, and often deprives of what we had before, we are neither to e&s;teem or de&s;pi&s;e her; but if we &s;hould receive from her a gift, take care to employ it immedi|ately to &s;ome good purpo&s;e, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="473" REF="488">in the acqui&s;ition of true &s;cience, the mo&s;t la&s;ting and precious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If we act otherwi&s;e, in re&s;pect of Fortune, we imitate tho&s;e wretched u&s;urers, who rejoice at the mo|ney paid in to them, as if they received it for their own u&s;e; but pay it back with regret, forgetting the condition, that it was to be re|turned to the proprietor on demand. Re|gardle&s;s of Fortune then, and all her changes in this mortal life, the <HI>genius</HI> advi&s;es to pa&s;s bravely on, without hearkning to the &s;ollici|tations of <HI>Incontinence</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> in the fir&s;t inclo&s;ure, to reject their <HI>temptations,</HI> and go on to <HI>fal&s;e learning:</HI> With her he would have us make a &s;hort &s;tay, to learn what may be of &s;ervice to u&s;e in our journey to Wi&s;dom.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P> Here the good <HI>old man</HI> had done, and I thanked him for his explanation of the <HI>picture.</HI> Only one thing (I &s;aid) there was more, which I mu&s;t reque&s;t he would tell me the meaning of. What is it we can get by our &s;tay with <HI>fal&s;e learning?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O.</SPEAKER>
<P> Things (he an&s;wered) that may be of u&s;e to us. The <HI>languages,</HI> and other parts of education, which <HI>Plato</HI> recommends, may hinder us from being wor&s;e employ'd, and keep us from illicit gratification. They are not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to true happine&s;s; but they contribute to make us better. Some|thing
<PB N="474" REF="489">thing good and u&s;eful they do afford; tho' virtue, which ought to be the principal bu&s;i|ne&s;s in view, may be acquired without them. We may become wi&s;e without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the arts, tho' (as ob&s;erved before,) they are far from being u&s;ele&s;s: as by a good tran&s;lation made into our own tongue, we may know what an author means, and yet by taking the pains to become ma&s;ters of the original language, might gain more advantages,&mdash;&s;uch as entring better into the writer's &s;en&s;e, and di&s;covering &s;ome beauties which cannot otherwi&s;e be found: So the u&s;eful things in the &s;ciences may be very quickly and ea&s;ily learned, and tho' by great labour in becoming accurately acquainted with them, we might fill our heads with &s;peculations, yet this cannot make us the wi&s;er and better men. <HI>Without being learned,</HI> we may be <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P> And are the <HI>learned</HI> then in no better a condition than the <HI>people</HI> in re&s;pect of <HI>moral excellence?</HI> (I &s;aid). Are the <HI>&s;peculations</HI> of the <HI>&s;cholar,</HI> and the <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>fine inventions</HI> of the <HI>&s;chools,</HI> of no u&s;e in <HI>perfecting</HI> the <HI>mo|ral character?</HI> This to me &s;eems a little &s;trange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Blind</HI> as the <HI>crowd</HI> is the <HI>man of letters,</HI> in this particular (my in&s;tructor replied): All his <HI>&s;tudies</HI> and <HI>curious knowledge</HI> have no <HI>relation</HI> to his <HI>living right.</HI> With all the <HI>tongues,</HI> and all the <HI>arts,</HI> he may be a <HI>liber|tine,</HI>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P> But what is the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;trange a thing, I reque&s;ted to know?

<P> It is their remaining in this <HI>&s;econd inclo|&s;ure,</HI> that occa&s;ions their being inferior in moral things to tho&s;e who have not had a learned education. <HI>Proud</HI> and &s;elf-&s;ufficient on account of their <HI>languages, arts,</HI> and <HI>&s;ci|ences,</HI> they de&s;pi&s;e what Wi&s;dom could teach them, and will not give them&s;elves the trouble of a&s;cending with difficulty to the man&s;ion of <HI>true learning.</HI> They have no ta&s;te for the <HI>le&s;&s;ons</HI> of <HI>Wi&s;dom;</HI> while the <HI>humble</HI> mount to her exalted dwelling, tho&s;e <HI>&s;cho|lars,</HI> as you &s;ee, are &s;atisfied with their <HI>&s;pecu|lations</HI> and <HI>vain conceits.

<PB N="476" REF="491">are what they only have a reli&s;h for; the <HI>ima|ginations</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>men of letters</HI> cannot reach that ineffable peace and contentment, that &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure, which flow from a <HI>virtuous life</HI> and an <HI>hone&s;t heart.</HI> This is the ca&s;e of our <HI>learned heads,</HI> ule&s;s <HI>repentance</HI> interferes to make them <HI>humble,</HI> and &s;cat|ters the <HI>vain vi&s;ions</HI> they had from <HI>fal&s;e opinion.</HI></P>

<P>As to the <HI>picture of Cebes,</HI> it is to be &s;ure a fine thing, and greatly to the honour of the <HI>Theban philo&s;opher,</HI> who was one of the di&s;ciples of <HI>Socrates;</HI> and about twenty at the time of the death of his ma&s;ter: <HI>Socrates</HI> died by the executioner, in the 70th year of his age, before our Lord, 402.&mdash;<HI>Cebes</HI> was about eighty, at the birth of <HI>Epicurus.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remark on the table of <HI>Cebes.</HI></NOTE>But after all that can be &s;aid in prai&s;e of this excel|lent remain of antiquity, &s;till the little <HI>&s;y&s;ten of ethics</HI> is but a <HI>poor performance,</HI> in re&s;pect of any &s;ection of the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t.

<PB N="477" REF="492">Nor does he mention the <HI>mi&s;chiefs</HI> of <HI>vice,</HI> and the <HI>benefits</HI> of <HI>virtue,</HI> as a <HI>divine con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>An Apo&s;tle, on the contrary, (to mention only one par|ticular out of a thou&s;and from the <HI>chri&s;tian books,</HI>) calls to the human race in the following manner: "I be&s;eech you, brethren, by the mercies of Almighty God, the Father of the Univer&s;e, who hath graciou&s;ly admitted you to, the faith, and revealed the terms of acceptance; that ye pre&s;ent your bodies now a living &s;acrifice, holy and acceptable to the Deity, which is the rea&s;onable and &s;piritual &s;ervice required of you in the time of the go&s;|pel; and not offer the bodies of bea&s;ts any more as the Heathen world were wont to do.</P>
<P>And, as per&s;ons now wholly devoted to the Lord of heaven and earth, be not conformed to the fa&s;hions and ways of this world; but be ye transformed by the re|newing of your mind; that ye may prove what is the good, the acceptable, and perfect will of God. Abhor that which is evil, in all your dealings: Cleave to that which is good: Let love be without di&s;&s;imulation, and be kindly affectioned one to another; not advancing your&s;elves, but in honour preferring one another. Be not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, but fervent in &s;pirit; as &s;erving the Lord Jehovah in your &s;everal &s;tations. Rejoice in hope of a refre&s;hment to come, in the realms of bli&s;s: Be patient in tribulation, which God will reward, and continue in&s;tant in prayer.</P>
<P>In &s;um, let us follow the &s;teps of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and in imi|tation of his <HI>divine humility,</HI> his <HI>devotion,</HI> his <HI>love,</HI> be for ever <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>forbearing, gentle</HI> and <HI>charitable,</HI> and <HI>live in the &s;pirit of prayer.</HI>"</P>
<P>What is there in the <HI>table of Cebes</HI> like this <HI>&s;piritual and religious virtue,</HI> this <HI>love to God,</HI> this <HI>zeal for his honour and &s;ervice,</HI> and an <HI>intire dependence upon him</HI> in all conditions of life? The <HI>virtues</HI> of the <HI>heroes of an|tiquity</HI> are noble and excellent qualities; &mdash; their cou|rage, and ju&s;tice, and temperance, and gratitude, and love to their country are fine things: but they &s;eem to have been calculated for the <HI>civil life.</HI> Tho&s;e <HI>heroes</HI> were virtuous without being pious, and appear rather
<PB N="478" REF="493">as &s;elf-&s;ufficient independent beings, than as &s;ervants and votaries of God Almighty. It is the&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tian virtues</HI> I hove mentioned, that <HI>adorn</HI> and <HI>perfect human nature.</HI> It is the&s;e things that <HI>mo&s;tly</HI> contribute to the <HI>happine&s;s of the world,</HI> and <HI>of every man in it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Scott,</HI> at the end of his <HI>Notes</HI> on <HI>Cebes,</HI> has the following remark. &mdash; If this philo&s;opher had repre|&s;ented the effects of virtue and vice as a <HI>divine con&s;ti|tution,</HI> he would have ennobled his in&s;truction, and done greater &s;ervice to the intere&s;t of morality. But tho&s;e important intere&s;ts are effectually provided for by revelation. There the precepts of virtue are the laws of God. There we find a clear and compleat &s;y&s;tem of his will. There our obedience is encouraged by hope in his pardoning mercy and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by the life, death, and re&s;urrection of his own &s;on; and by promi&s;es and threatnings which extend the reward of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the puni&s;hment of wickedne&s;s unto a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P></NOTE></P>

<PB N="480" REF="495">a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and a valuable collection of books; I thought my&s;elf &s;o happily &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="481" REF="496">flouri&s;hing mercies, and &s;o well &s;ecured from adver&s;ity, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible for the flame of de&s;truction to reach me. But when I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to imagine cala|mity was near me, and fondly imagined pro|&s;perity was my own, infelicity came &s;talking on un&s;een; and from a fulne&s;s of peace, plunged us at once into an aby&s;s of woe. It was our wont, when the evenings were fine, to take boat at the bottom of a meadow, at the end of our garden, and in the mid|dle
<PB N="482" REF="497">of a deep river, pa&s;s an hour or two in fi&s;hing; but at la&s;t, by &s;ome accident or other, a &s;lip of the foot, or the boat's being got a little too far from the bank-&s;ide, <HI>Julia</HI> fell in and was drowned. This happened in the tenth month of our marriage. The lo&s;s of this <HI>charming angel</HI> in &s;uch a manner, &s;at powerfully on my &s;pirits for &s;ome time; and the remembrance of her perfections, and the delights I enjoyed while &s;he lived, made me wi&s;h I had never &s;een her. To be &s;o va&s;tly happy as I was, and be deprived of her in a moment, in &s;o &s;hocking a way, was an affliction I was hardly able to bear. It &s;truck me to the heart. I &s;at with my eyes &s;hut ten days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A reflexion on the death of <HI>Julia.</HI></NOTE>&sect;. 2.

<P>We ought likewi&s;e to learn from &s;uch things, to look upon the &s;ad accidents of life, as not worthy to be compared with what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> underwent for our &s;akes, who, <HI>though

</LETTER>
<P>From the date of this letter it appeared, that they were not a month gone before my arrival; but to what place they &s;aid not, and it was in vain for me to enquire. I found every thing in good order, and all the goods &s;afe;
<PB N="487" REF="502">the garden full of fruits and vegetables, and plenty of various eatables in the hou&s;e, pickled, potted, and pre&s;erved.

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of the beautiful LEONORA.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 5. As I rambled one &s;ummer's morn|ing, with my gun and my dog; over the va&s;t mountains, which &s;urrounded me at <HI>Orton-lodge,</HI> I came as the &s;un was ri&s;ing to a valley about four miles from my hou&s;e, which I had not &s;een before, as the way to it, over the <HI>Fells,</HI> was a dangerous road. It was green and flowery, had clumps of oaks in &s;everal &s;pots, and from the hovering top of a pre|cipice at the end of the glin, a river falls ingulphed in rifted rocks. It is a fine rural &s;cene.</P>
<P>Here I &s;at down to re&s;t my&s;elf, and was admiring the natural beauties of the place, when I &s;aw three <HI>females</HI> turn into the vale, and walk towards the <HI>water-fall.</HI> One of them, who appeared to be the mi&s;tre&s;s, had an extravagance of beauty in her face, and a form &s;uch as I had not often &s;een. The others were pretty women, dre&s;t like quakers, and very clean. They came very near the water where I was, but did not &s;ee me, as I was behind two rocks which almo&s;t joined: And after they had looked a while at the headlong river, they went back, and entring a narrow-way between two hills di&s;|appeared. I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at what I
<PB N="489" REF="504">had &s;een, not imagining I had &s;uch a neigh|bour in <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> and re&s;olved to know who this beauty was. The wonders of her face, her figure, and her mien, were &s;triking to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Ari&s;ing then as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight, I walked on to the turning I &s;aw them enter; and in half an hour's time came to a plain, thro' which &s;everal brooks wandered, and on the margin of one of them, was a grove and a man&s;ion. It was a &s;weet habi|tation, at the entrance of the little wood; and before the door, on banks of flowers, &s;at the illu&s;trious owner of this retreat, and her two maids. In &s;uch a place, in &s;uch a man|ner, &s;o unexpectedly to find &s;o charming a woman, &s;eemed to me as plea&s;ing an inci|dent as could be met with in travelling over the world.</P>
<P>At my coming near this lady &s;he appeared to be a&s;toni&s;hed, and to wonder much at &s;eeing &s;uch an inhabitant in that part of the world: but on pulling off my hat, and telling her I came to vi&s;it her as her neighbour; to pay my humble re&s;pects to her, and beg the honour of her acquaintance; &s;he a&s;ked me, from what vale or mountain I came, and how long I had been a re&s;ident in that wild part of the world ? This produced a compend of &s;ome part of my &s;tory, and when I had done, &s;he de&s;ired, me to walk in. Coffee
<PB N="490" REF="505">and hot rolls was &s;oon brought, and we break|fa&s;ted chearfully together. I took my leave &s;oon after, having made her a pre&s;ent of &s;ome black cocks and a hare I had &s;hot that morning; and hoped, if it was po&s;&s;ible to find an ea&s;y way to my lodge, which I did not yet know, that I &s;hould &s;ome time or other be honoured with her pre&s;ence at my little hou&s;e; which was worth her &s;eeing, as it was &s;ituated in the mo&s;t delightful part of this romantic &s;ilent place, and had ma|ny curio&s;ities near it; that in the mean time, if it was agreeable, I would wait upon her again, before I left <HI>Richmond&s;hire,</HI> which would be &s;oon: For I only came to &s;ee how things were, and was obliged to ha&s;ten another way. This <HI>beauty</HI> replied, that it would give her plea&s;ure to &s;ee me, when I had a few hours to &s;pare. Three times more then I went very &s;oon; we be|came well acquainted, and after dinner one day, &s;he gave me the following relation.</P>
<P>My name was <HI>Leonora Sarsfield</HI> before I married an Iri&s;hman, one <HI>Burk,</HI> whom I met at <HI>Avignon</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> He is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men of the age, tho' his hopes were all his fortune; but proved a villain as great as ever di&s;graced mankind. His breed|ing and his eloquence, added to his fine figure, induced me to fancy him an angel of a man, and imagine I had well be&s;towed a hundred
<PB N="491" REF="506">thou&s;and pounds, to make him great, and as happy as the day is long: For three months he played the <HI>god,</HI> and I fondly thought there was not &s;uch another happy woman as my|&s;elf in all the world. I was mi&s;taken. <HI>Burk</HI> found out by &s;ome means or other, that I had concealed five thou&s;and pounds of my fortune from his knowledge; and that I was in my heart &s;o good a <HI>prote&s;tant,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to bring me over to <HI>popery,</HI> or ever get me to be an <HI>idolater</HI> at the <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> before the <HI>tiny god of dough:</HI>&mdash;that I could never be brought to look upon the <HI>invented &s;uper&s;titions,</HI> and <HI>horrible corruptions</HI> of the <HI>church of Rome,</HI> as the true religion; nor be ever per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the <HI>Latin &s;ervice</HI> in that communion, as it mu&s;t be an <HI>abomination</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and to <HI>God,</HI> if the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> may be depended upon as the <HI>rule of faith:</HI> &mdash;When <HI>Burk</HI> perceived the&s;e things, he threw off the di&s;gui&s;e, and appeared a <HI>mon&s;ter</HI> in&s;tead of a man, as he was a <HI>bigot</HI> of the fir&s;t order, a furi|ous <HI>papi&s;t,</HI> (which I did not know, when we married;) and as he was by nature as <HI>cruel,</HI> as he was <HI>avaricious</HI> by principle, he began to u&s;e me in the vile&s;t manner, and by <HI>words</HI> and <HI>deeds,</HI> did all he could to make my life a burthen to me. He was for ever abu&s;ing me in the vile&s;t language; cur&s;ing me for a heretic for ever damned; and by blows compelling me to inform him where my money was. He has left me all
<PB N="492" REF="507">over blood very often, and when he found I &s;till held out, and would not di&s;cover to him what remained of my fortune; nor, which I valued much more than my money, violate my religion, by renouncing the cu&s;|toms and practice of the reformed church, and joining in the <HI>&s;inful wor&s;hip</HI> of the <HI>ma&s;s;</HI> he came to me one night with a &s;mall oak &s;apling, and beat me in &s;uch a manner as left me almo&s;t dead. He then went out of the hou&s;e, told me he would return by twelve, and make me comply, or he would break every bone in my body. This happened at a country-&s;eat of mine in this &s;hire; all the &s;ervants being obliged to lie every night in an out-hou&s;e, that he might have the more power over me. His <HI>exce&s;&s;ive avarice</HI> was but one cau&s;e of this inhuman behavi|our: It was the <HI>zeal</HI> of this <HI>raging bigot</HI> for his <HI>ever-cur&s;ed popery,</HI> that made him act the unrelenting inqui&s;itor.</P>

This was known only to my&s;elf, as it was a pa&s;&s;age my father had made, (in ca&s;e of thieves, or any villains,) from a little unfrequented cel|lar, by a narrow a&s;cending arch, to a thicket in the corner of a &s;hrubby field, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. To a labyrinth made in this &s;mall grove I made what ha&s;te I could, and had not been long there, be|fore I perceived through the trees my inhu|man hu&s;band; and as he came near me, heard him &s;ay, &s;he &s;hall tell me where my money is, (for all &s;he has is mine;) and wor&s;hip our <HI>lady</HI> and the <HI>ho&s;t,</HI> or I will burn
<PB N="496" REF="511">her fle&s;h off her bones, and make her feel as many torments here, as the <HI>heretics</HI> are tortured with in everla&s;ting pain. The &s;ight of the mon&s;ter made me tremble to &s;o violent a degree, that I was &s;carcely able to proceed to the cottage of a poor woman, my &s;ure friend, about two miles from the place I was hid in; but I did my be&s;t to creep through cro&s;s ways, and after many difficulties, and &s;uffering much by going over ditches, I got to my re&s;ting-place. The old woman, my nur&s;e, &s;creeched at the &s;ight of me, as I was &s;adly torn, and all over gore. Such a &s;pectacle to be &s;ure has &s;eldom been &s;een. But by peace and proper things, I got well again in two months, and removed to this lone hou&s;e, which my father had built in this &s;pot for his occa&s;ional retirement. Here I have been for two years pa&s;t, and am as happy as I de&s;ire to be: Nay va&s;tly &s;o, as I am now free and delivered from a mon&s;ter, who&s;e avarice and cruelty made me a &s;pectacle to angels and men: Becau&s;e, Sir, I would not reduce my&s;elf to the &s;tate of a beggar, to &s;atisfy his in&s;atiable love of money: nor wor&s;hip his <HI>dead-woman,</HI> and <HI>bit of bread;</HI> his <HI>rabble</HI> of, <HI>&s;aints, images, re|licks,</HI> and that <HI>&s;overeign cheat,</HI> the <HI>Pope;</HI> be|cau&s;e I would not give up all I had, and be|come an <HI>idolater,</HI> as far more <HI>de&s;picable</HI> and <HI>&s;inful</HI> than the <HI>antient Pagans;</HI> as the <HI>Romi&s;h ritual</HI> and <HI>devotions,</HI> are more <HI>&s;tupid</HI> and <HI>abo|minable</HI>

<P>Such, Sir, was my <HI>fatal marriage,</HI> which I thought would be a &s;tock of &s;uch felicities, that time only by many years could reduce to an evane&s;cent &s;tate, and deprive me of: As <HI>Ve|nus</HI> was at the <HI>bridal</HI> with her whole retinue; the <HI>ardent amorous boy,</HI> the <HI>&s;i&s;ter-graces</HI> in their loo&s;e attire; <HI>Aglavia, Thalia,</HI> and <HI>Euphro&s;ine,</HI> bright, blooming, and gay; and was attend|ed by <HI>Youth,</HI> that <HI>wayward thing</HI> without her; was conducted by <HI>Mercury,</HI> the <HI>god</HI> of <HI>elo|quence,</HI> and by <HI>Pitho,</HI> the <HI>godde&s;s</HI> of <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion;</HI> as all &s;eemed plea&s;urable and inchanting, my young imagination formed golden &s;cenes, and painted a happine&s;s quite glorious and &s;ecure.

A rare|faction in his &s;tomach, by the heat and fer|mentation of what he had taken the night before at &s;upper, de&s;troyed him. That con|cave vi&s;cus, or bowel, which is &s;eated in the abdomen below the diaphragm, I mean the &s;tomach, was inflamed, and as the de&s;cend|ing trunk of the <HI>aorta</HI> pa&s;&s;es down between it and the &s;pine, that is, between the &s;tomach and back part of the ribs, the inflation and di&s;tention of the bowel compre&s;&s;ed and con|&s;tringed the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of the artery <HI>aorta,</HI> in its de&s;cending branch, and by le&s;|&s;ening
<PB N="519" REF="534">it, impeded the de&s;cent of the blood from the heart, and obliged it to a&s;cend in a greater quantity than u&s;ual to the head. By this means, the parts of the head were di&s;tended and &s;tretched with blood, which brought on an apoplexy, and the operation upward being violent, the equilibrium was intirely broken, and the vital tide could flow no more. This I found on opening the body. I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved that, exclu|&s;ive of the compre&s;&s;ure of the de&s;cending trunk of the artery <HI>aorta,</HI> the mu&s;cular coats of the &s;tomach were &s;tretched, inflated, and di&s;tended; and of con&s;equence, the blood-ve&s;&s;els which enter into the con&s;titution of tho&s;e mu&s;cles, were &s;tretched, dilated, and turgid with blood, and therefore the blood could not be driven forward in the cour&s;e of its circulation with its natural and due velo|city, but mu&s;t prove an ob&s;tacle to the de|&s;cent of the blood from the heart, and ob|lige almo&s;t the whole tide to move upwards. This, and the con&s;tringing the <HI>aorta,</HI> at its orifice or tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection, between the co&s;tae and the bowel called the &s;tomach, is enough, I a&s;&s;ure you, Reader, to knock up the head of a giant, and put a &s;top to all the opera|tions of nature. Thus fell this gentleman in the 32d year of his age.</P>

We were married the week after, and I was even hap|pier than I had ever been before; which mu&s;t amount to a felicity inconceivably great indeed.

Upon this religious practice as a fundamental rule he had at la&s;t fixed. He &s;aw it was the &s;afe way, and would never depart from it.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, my candid Reader, to take my leave of you at this time, I have only to ob&s;erve, that as this volume is full large, I cannot add my intended XVth &s;ec|tion, but only &s;ay in a &s;hort &s;ummary, that &s;oon after my arrival at <HI>Bagatrogh Ca&s;tle,</HI> my father's &s;eat on <HI>Mall-Bay,</HI> on the coa&s;t of <HI>Galway</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the old gentleman died, and as in a pa&s;&s;ion, he had irrevocably &s;et|tled the greate&s;t part of his large e&s;tate on a near relation of mine, and had it not in his power to leave me more than a hundred a year, a little ready money, and a &s;mall &s;hip, which lay before his door in the Bay, he de&s;cended to the grave in great trouble, with many tears. Like old <HI>I&s;aac</HI> over <HI>E&s;au,</HI> he wept bitterly, and wi&s;hed in vain, that it was in his power to undo what he had done.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my father was buried, I re|turned to <HI>England</HI> with my wife, in the little ve&s;&s;el, now my own, which lay in the Bay,
<PB N="526" REF="541">and immediately after landing, and laying up my &s;hip in a &s;afe place, we went to <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ora</HI> again, there lived for one year as happy as two mortals could be; but in the begin|ning of the year 1736; &s;he died of the &s;mall pox, and to divert my mind, it came into my head to go to &s;ea, and make &s;ome voy|ages in my own little &s;hip, which was an excellent one for &s;trength and &s;ailing, tho' but a &s;loop of twenty-five tons. I went captain my&s;elf, and had an ingenious young gentleman, one <HI>Jackman,</HI> for my mate, who had been in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> &s;everal times, &s;ix good hands, and two cabbin-boys. Every thing nece&s;&s;ary, convenient, and fit, books, mathematical in&s;truments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we took on board, and weighed anchor the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> 1736.</P>
<P>We went on &s;hore at the <HI>Canary I&s;lands,</HI> the <HI>Cape de Verd I&s;lands,</HI> and other places. We pa&s;&s;ed the Sun in 15 degrees North latitude, and from that time &s;tanding South; cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Line;</HI> the heats intolerable, and the mu&s;quitoes and bugs in&s;ufferable. We &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the <HI>Northern</HI> &s;tar, and had the <HI>Cro&s;iers</HI> and <HI>Magellan</HI> clouds in view.

<P>Nine years of my life was &s;pent in tra|velling and &s;ailing about, and at la&s;t I re|turned to re&s;t and reflect, and in rational a|mu&s;ements pa&s;s the remainder of my time a|way. I retired to a little flowery retreat I had purcha&s;ed within a few miles of <HI>London,</HI> that I might ea&s;ily know what was doing in this hemi&s;phere, while I belong to it; and in the mid&s;t of groves and &s;treams, fields and

His temper was charming, &s;weet, and delightful; and his manners quite primitive and uncommonly pious: He was all charity and goodne&s;s, and &s;o &s;oft and gentle in conver&s;ation, that I have thought my&s;elf in company with one of the men of the fir&s;t church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> while with him. He had likewi&s;e the ju&s;te&s;t notions of <HI>chri&s;tian temper</HI> and <HI>practice,</HI> and recommended them in &s;o in&s;inuating a manner, that even a rake would hear him with plea&s;ure. I have not &s;een any like him among the &s;ons of men in the&s;e parti|culars. It was wrong to put him in the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and call him <HI>one Law,</HI> as <HI>Pope</HI> does. He was really a very
<PB N="529" REF="544">extraordinary man; and to his honour be it remem|bred, that he had the great concern of human life at heart, took a deal of pains in the pulpit, and from the pre&s;s, (witne&s;s his two fine books on a devout life,) to make men fear God and keep his commandments. He was a good man indeed.</P>

<L>Oft li&s;ten till the raptur'd &s;oul takes wings,</L>
<L>While <HI>Plato</HI> rea&s;ons, or while <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or when the night's dark wings this globe &s;urround,</L>
<L>And the pale moon begins her &s;olemn round;</L>
<L>When night has drawn her curtains o'er the plain,</L>
<L>And &s;ilence rea&s;&s;umes her awful reign;</L>
<L>Bid my free &s;oul to &s;tarry orbs repair,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e radiant orbs that float in ambient air,</L>
<L>And with a regular confu&s;ion &s;tray,</L>
<L>Oblique, direct, along the aerial way:</L>
<L>Fountains of day! &s;tupendous orbs of light!</L>
<L>Which by their di&s;tance le&s;&s;en to the &s;ight:</L>
<L>And if the <HI>gla&s;s</HI> you u&s;e, t'improve your eyes,</L>
<L>Millions beyond the former millions ri&s;e.</L>
<L>For no end were they made? Or, but to blaze</L>
<L>Through empty &s;pace, and u&s;ele&s;s &s;pend their rays?</L>
<L>Or ought we not with rea&s;on to reply,</L>
<L>Each lucid point which glows in yonder &s;ky,</L>
<L>Informs a &s;y&s;tem in the boundle&s;s &s;pace,</L>
<L>And fills with glory its appointed place:</L>
<L><PB N="532" REF="547">
With beams, unborrow'd, brightens other &s;kies,</L>
<L>And worlds, to thee unknown, with heat and life &s;upplies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chiefly, O my &s;oul, apply to loftier themes,</L>
<L>The opening heav'ns, and angels rob'd with flames:</L>
<L>Read in the <HI>&s;acred leaves</HI> how time began,</L>
<L>And the du&s;t mov'd, and quicken'd into man;</L>
<L>Here through the flow'ry walks of <HI>Eden</HI> rove,</L>
<L>Court the &s;oft breeze, or range the &s;picy grove;</L>
<L>There tread on hallow'd ground where angels trod,</L>
<L>And rev'rend patriarchs talk'd as friends with God;</L>
<L>Or hear the voice to &s;lumb'ring prophets giv'n,</L>
<L>Or gaze on vi&s;ions from the throne of heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus lonely, thoughtful may I run the race</L>
<L>Of tran&s;ient life, in no unu&s;eful ea&s;e:</L>
<L>Enjoy each hour, nor as it fleets away,</L>
<L>Think life too &s;hort, and yet too long the day;</L>
<L>Of right ob&s;ervant, while my &s;oul attends</L>
<L>Each duty, and makes heav'n and angels friends:</L>
<L>Can welcome death with <HI>Faith</HI>'s expecting eye,</L>
<L>And mind no pangs, &s;ince <HI>Hope</HI> &s;tands &s;miling by;</L>
<L>Nor &s;tudious how to make a longer &s;tay,</L>
<L>Views heav'nly plains and realms of brighter day;</L>
<L>Shakes off her load, and wing'd with ardent love,</L>
<L>Spurns at the earth, and &s;prings her flight above,</L>
<L>Soaring thro' air to realms where angels dwell,</L>
<L>Pities the &s;hrieking friends, and leaves the le&s;&s;|ning bell."</L>
