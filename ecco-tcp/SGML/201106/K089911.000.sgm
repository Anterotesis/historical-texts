<HEAD>A DISSERTATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL tho&s;e who are concerned in Medical Enquiries, at lea&s;t tho&s;e who have had long Practice and Experience, will rea|dily allow, that the Want of an effectual Reme|dy for the King's Evil, and all &s;crophulous Com|plaints, is one of the De&s;iderata of the healing Art: For notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ted Effects of the Salt Water, aided with the U&s;e of Burnt Sponge, Millipedes, Aethiops Mineral, Aethiops Antimoni|alis, and all other Medicines in Vogue, it has not come to our Knowledge, that two Patients have ever been cured of a confirmed Scrophula, where the Glands were indurated, the Joints &s;o affected as to have running Ulcers, the Bones foul, and the Body wa&s;ting with a hectic Heat. If, therefore, we are &s;o happy as to point out a Medicine, which, without either Confinement, or giving the Patient any Unea&s;ine&s;s, will in a little Time cure this Di&s;order, which has been hitherto deemed in|curable, we &s;hall think our&s;elves intitled to the Good-will of the Public.</P>
<P>We are not in&s;en&s;ible, that &s;ome of the Faculty, who are tender of pre&s;cribing Medicines to their Patients, which have not had the Sanction of the College, will object to this as being a No&s;trum, with the &s;pecific Qualities of which they are unac|quainted; but the&s;e Gentlemen would do well to con&s;ider, that they know as little of many of the Drugs and Medicines they now pre&s;cribe, as they do of this No&s;trum. It is a Di&s;pute, not yet deter|mined, whether mo&s;t of the Manna exhibited to Sale, is natural or factitious, and tho&s;e who pre|&s;cribe and apply Chemical Medicines, prepared by the common Chemi&s;ts, are in as great a State of Uncertainty as Ignorance and Artifice can place them.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>But the Objection, which will probably be made to this Medicine, on Account of its Compo&s;ition being a Secret, may perhaps in Time be remov|ed; for when its Efficacy is firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed and acknowledged beyond Controver&s;y, the Proprie|tors have Thoughts of pre&s;enting it to the Public, if their good Intentions are not prevented by any cruel and unrea&s;onable Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>All the Favour the Proprietors a&s;k of the Pub|lic, e&s;pecially of the Gentlemen of the Faculty, is to give this Medicine a fair and candid Trial in tho&s;e Ca&s;es only, where all other Medicines in Practice have proved ineffectual. This can neither le&s;&s;en their Profits, nor dimini&s;h their Reputation, but will, we pre&s;ume, have a contrary Effect. It may wre&s;t Patients from the Jaws of Death who may employ them upon &s;ome future Occa&s;ion, which will add both to their Emolument and Credit; and be&s;ides this, they will feel the Self-&s;atisfaction of having acted with Integrity, Ju|&s;tice, and Mercy, which to a wi&s;e and good Man is a Matter of the greate&s;t Moment.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who con&s;ider how little Phy&s;ick has been improved by hypothetical Rea&s;oning, and how much by hone&s;t Practice and Experience, will be inclined to grant this Medicine a fair and can|did Trial; and when it is found to cure, will, we doubt not, receive, and apply it in Practice as they do other Medicines; &s;ince this may be done without the lea&s;t Rea&s;on for Reproach. The having cured one Per&s;on with it will be a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for attempting the Cure of another; Experience will aid the Practitioner, and his Practice will be ju&s;tified upon Principles as rational as any of tho&s;e on which the Faculty now proceed. All Modes of Practice which are not deduced from Experience are of little or no Effect. Experience fir&s;t laid the Foundation of Phy&s;ick, and it is that alone which can &s;upport its Reputation.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>It will be no Degradation of this Medicine to &s;ay, it was at fir&s;t di&s;covered by Accident, and then perfected by Experience; for if we look back to the Origin of Phy&s;ic, we &s;hall find, that it took its Ri&s;e from natural Sagacity improving upon accidental and unfore&s;een Events. In the fir&s;t Ages of the World we do not learn from Hi|&s;tory, that there were any public Profe&s;&s;ors in Me|dicine, though it was &s;o effential to the Pre&s;erva|tion of Mankind. <HI>Homer</HI> indeed mentions <HI>Machaon</HI> and <HI>Podalirius</HI> with E&s;teem, but from what ap|pears in that Poem, they &s;eem to be celebrated only for their Art in healing Wounds.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;ed, in the&s;e early Times, were gene|rally placed in the Streets, the Cro&s;s-ways and other public Places, for the In&s;pection and Examination of tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by, and all who had Skill in the Di&s;order, or knew of an efficacious Remedy, thought it a Duty to give their Advice; and when any remarkable Cure was performed, the Memory of it was pre&s;erved for the Benefit of Po&s;terity, by engraving the Di&s;order, and the Symptoms by which it might be known, together with the re|medy and its Succe&s;s on the Pillars or Walls of their Temples and other public Buildings. By this Means a Variety of Rules and Remedies were Re|gi&s;tered for univer&s;al Benefit; and as tho&s;e who travelled for In&s;truction, trea&s;ured up this Sort of Knowledge, as well as that of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Countries they vi&s;ited, the Medi|cal Tran&s;actions of one Nation were ea&s;ily con|veyed to that of another.</P>
<P>Thus repeated Trials and Experience laid the Foundation of the Art of Medicine, and taught the Virtues, at lea&s;t many of the Virtues, of vege|table, mineral, and animal Sub&s;tances, and in what Di&s;ea&s;es they might be applied with Safety and Succe&s;s. Tho&s;e, who from long Experience and accurate Ob&s;ervation only, had obtained any Degree
<PB N="6" REF="5">of Skill and Reputation in the Art were called Em|pirics; a Term, which however mi&s;applied now, conveyed with it then a very different Idea, and was u&s;ed as a Mark of Eminence and E&s;teem; for the&s;e Empirics did not, like many of our modern Phy&s;icians, employ their Time in writing fanciful Theories and jumbling fal&s;e Philo&s;ophy with in|trin&s;ick Truth, but in carefully collecting what others had gained from Experience, in making cautious Experiments them&s;elves, and in writ|ing accurate Hi&s;tories of the Di&s;ea&s;es which came under their Cognizance.</P>
<P>This was the Road to Medical Certainty, and had this Method been carefully pur&s;ued, Phy&s;ic would have made a different Appearance from what it does at pre&s;ent, and few Di&s;ea&s;es would have baffled the Art of the &s;agacious Phy&s;ician: But many of the mo&s;t celebrated Practitioners, ei|ther too ignorant to make farther Di&s;coveries, or too &s;elf-&s;ufficient to avail them&s;elves of the Expe|rience of others, fancied that they had arrived at the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of the Art, and in&s;tead of &s;earch|ing farther, employed them&s;elves in accounting for the Operation of Medicines by the mechanic Laws, and in cla&s;&s;ing the Remedies already known, and tying down others to tho&s;e Forms which they thought proper to approve. Hence all new Di&s;co|veries were deemed Innovations, the Inventors of them branded with the opprobrious Name of Quacks, and both they and their Compo&s;itions held in the utmo&s;t Contempt. This Aver&s;ion to new Medicines long confined the U&s;e of Mercury to Barbers and others ignorant of the animal Oeco|nomy, who cured their Patients, and acquired Fortunes, while the regular Practitioner ob&s;tinately &s;uffered his to langui&s;h and die according to the Rules of Art. This likewi&s;e was the Ca&s;e of the Bark, which, though now deemed one of the be&s;t Medicines in the World, was oppo&s;ed with
<PB N="7" REF="6">all the Acrimony and Virulence that Prejudice and Malice could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things, one would think, &s;hould &s;timulate the Faculty to the Pur&s;uit of more efficacious Medicines than what are now contained in their Di&s;pen&s;atories, and induce them to behave with more Candour to tho&s;e, who are &s;o fortunate as to make new and valuable Di&s;coveries. Nor &s;hould the Aid of the Legi&s;lature be here ne|glected, &s;ince &s;mall Premiums would generally in|duce tho&s;e who have di&s;covered any valuable Me|dicine to di&s;clo&s;e the Secret.</P>
<P>With Regard to the Medicine, which is the Subject of this Pamphlet, we can &s;ay with great Truth, that it was fir&s;t di&s;covered by Accident, and applied to the Cure of many, and very dif|ferent Di&s;orders by a Per&s;on who had no Know|ledge of Medicine; but falling accidentally into the Hands of one who had more Skill, and al&s;o an Opportunity of making proper Ob&s;ervations, it was improved from Time to Time, till brought to the State in which it now appears, and found to be an effectual Cure for this dreadful Di&s;tem|per. But more of this when we come to de&s;cribe &s;ome of the Ca&s;es of tho&s;e who have been cured. Previous to which, it may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for us to give &s;ome Account of the Di&s;order it&s;elf, and of the Methods hitherto pur&s;ued to effect the Cure.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>Of the</HI> KING's EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>King's Evil</HI> appears to have been a Di&s;|ea&s;e of great Antiquity, being the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> Phy&s;icians, and the <HI>Strumae</HI> of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> and the <HI>Latins,</HI> who &s;ometimes call it <HI>Scrophula.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t common Seat of this Di&s;order is in the Neck, the Arm-pits and Groin, e&s;pecially in young Children, whom it al&s;o very frequently
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;eizes in the upper Lip, which becomes remarka|bly thick and &s;ometimes chapped; it likewi&s;e very often affects the <HI>Glandula Lachrymalis,</HI> and brings on a <HI>Scrophulous Opthalmia,</HI> known by its Ob&s;tinacy in re&s;i&s;ting all common Remedies.</P>
<P><HI>Scrophulous Tumors</HI> rarely happen to Adults and old Per&s;ons, but when they do, are mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and trouble&s;ome, hardly differing in their Nature from a <HI>Cancer;</HI> in which Ca&s;e, as a Fever is ex|cited, the Tumor is unequal, and attended with pul&s;atory Pains, and the Veins over it become tumid and prominent.</P>
<P>In the milder Sort the Tumor is equal, round, circum&s;cribed, not very hard, free from Inflam|mation and Pain, and in mo&s;t Re&s;pects re&s;embling a <HI>Schirrus.</HI></P>
<P>The Glands of the external Parts are not only affected with this Di&s;ea&s;e; for tho&s;e al&s;o of the Me&s;entery are almo&s;t always found enlarged, up|on opening Per&s;ons who have died of it: More|over the Humour &s;ometimes falls upon the Lungs, and brings on a <HI>pulmonary Con&s;umption;</HI> and indeed that Con&s;umption is generally owing to a <HI>&s;crophu|lous</HI> Cau&s;e, in this and all other Northern Countries.</P>
<P>Scrophulous Tumors are for the mo&s;t part oc|ca&s;ioned by Ob&s;tructions of the Glands, Want of Exerci&s;e, Rickets in Children, Want of Dige&s;tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it is generally allowed, that a conti|nued Abu&s;e of the Non-naturals may give Ri&s;e to this Di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o admitted, by &s;ome Phy&s;icians, that it may be communicated by Contagion, and by the vitiated Milk of a pregnant Woman.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t unhappy and truly deplorable Cir|cum&s;tance of the <HI>King's Evil</HI> is, that it is but too often tran&s;mitted from Parents to their Children, by way of Inheritance, which it does not ea&s;ily give up, but entails upon late Po&s;terity. Thus the Relicks of the <HI>Venereal Lues,</HI> a rank, inveterate
<PB N="9" REF="8"><HI>Scurvy,</HI> or <HI>White Swellings</HI> in any Part of the Body, either of Father or Mother, may put on the true Type and Character of the <HI>Evil</HI> in the Offspring, as well as the <HI>&s;crophulous Virus</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;order is mild, the Tumors move|able, &s;uperficial, &s;oft, and &s;eated in the conglobate Glands of young Children, a Cure is not to be de|&s;paired of, even in the common Method of Treat|ment. Nay, it is &s;ometimes known to wear it|&s;elf off, as the Growth advances and the Habit al|ters; for which we have al&s;o the Authority of <HI>Hip|pocrates.</HI> But when the Tumors attack the Tendons or Ligaments, e&s;pecially if near large Ve&s;&s;els, or pre&s;s upon the Windpipe or <HI>Oe&s;ophagus,</HI> they are very difficult of Cure; for whatever Way the Swel|lings are treated, in order to open and cicatri&s;e them, they generally break out again near the old Scars. When the Di&s;order is violent and inveterate it degenerates into a malignant and corroding Ul|cer, by which, not only the Part primarily affected, but al&s;o tho&s;e contiguous to it are corroded and de|&s;troyed, and even the Bones made carious. The Tu|mor becomes wor&s;e by being handled, and, becau&s;e it cannot be brought to Maturation, la&s;ts during the Whole of the Patient's Life. In a word, there is &s;carce any Di&s;ea&s;e more ob&s;tinately la&s;ting than this, which has been often thought ab&s;olutely incurable.</P>
<P>The Ancients had but few Remedies for this per|plexing Complaint. They &s;ucceeded be&s;t by the U&s;e of the actual Cautery, and Inci&s;ion. The only in|ternal Medicine, according to <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> was, white Hellebore, frequently repeated; excepting a very ab&s;urd one, known only to a few Pea&s;ants, which was that of &s;wallowing a Snake.</P>
<P>The Moderns have gone to work chiefly with Vomits, Purgatives, Deob&s;truents, Sudorifics, Ab|&s;orbents, Antimonials, and Mercurials, and &s;ome|times with Mineral Waters. At the &s;ame Time re|commending a moderate and &s;lender Diet, lubricat|ing
<PB N="10" REF="9">Broths and Jellies, with Exerci&s;e, and forbidding all vi&s;cid Aliments, as Chee&s;e, Fi&s;h, and the like.</P>
<P>As to the external Treatment of &s;crophulous Tumors, it has been attempted to di&s;cu&s;s them by mercurial Unguents, Liniments, and Plai&s;ters, premi&s;ing Phlebotomy, and Purging. If by the U&s;e of the&s;e Means the Tumor did not di&s;cu&s;s, but increa&s;e in Size and Hardne&s;s, Suppuration was then attempted; and it &s;hould &s;eem the &s;afer and more natural Way of the two; &s;ince to en|deavour to di&s;cu&s;s often increa&s;es the Hardne&s;s, and turns the Tumor cancerous. In the &s;uppura|tive Way, all Evacuations were omitted, and a Plai&s;ter of <HI>Diach. cum Gumm.</HI> Burgundy Pitch, or the like laid on, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted occa&s;ionally with a proper Catapla&s;m.</P>
<P>When the Swelling was ripened, &s;o far as to di&s;cover fluctuating Matter, the Part was opened, either by Inci&s;ion, or Cau&s;tic, to give Vent to it; and after the Separation of the E&s;char, the Ulcer was dre&s;&s;ed with a Dige&s;tive, and then healed. Yet this Method has generally mi&s;carried.</P>
<P><HI>The Proprietors of this Medicine, however, neither attempt to</HI> di&s;cu&s;s Tumors, <HI>nor to bring on a</HI> Sup|puration; <HI>they apply no</HI> Cau&s;tics, <HI>nor terrify their Patients with the</HI> Knife: <HI>Their u&s;ual Way has been, to leave the Afflicted to the</HI> Medicine, <HI>and to</HI> Nature, <HI>which kindly co-operating have always produced an happy Event.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> as in mo&s;t other chronical Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;pecific Remedies have been recommend|ed, applauded, and relap&s;ed into Di&s;u&s;e, in all Ages. The <HI>Veratrum album,</HI> or <HI>White Hellebore,</HI> has been mentioned already. The <HI>Tactus Regalis</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Sovereigns, &s;o long held in reverential E&s;teem, is, at this Day, if not univer|&s;ally, at lea&s;t, by the mo&s;t Judicious, given up, and no longer in U&s;e. Dr. <HI>Gideon Harvey</HI>'s <HI>Antimonium re&s;u&s;citatum</HI> had its Run; and &s;o, in our Days,
<PB N="11" REF="10">has Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI>'s <HI>E&s;&s;ence of Antimony.</HI> Above twenty Years ago, a Lady of the fir&s;t Nobility was cured of a very large Tumor in her Neck, by Means of a Specific, then kept a great Secret, altho' it has been affirmed, that the Cure afterwards co&s;t her her Life. This proved to be <HI>burnt Sponge,</HI> a Medicine adopted indeed by the late Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> who u&s;ually admini&s;tered it, mixed with <HI>purified Nitre, Coralline</HI> and <HI>Sugar:</HI> But it has been known to fail in a hundred In&s;tances. The late Dr. <HI>Ru&s;|&s;el,</HI> who practi&s;ed in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> laid great Stre&s;s upon <HI>Sea-Water</HI> as a Specific in glandular Di&s;orders; and it has been u&s;ed in our Ho&s;pitals, but is like the re&s;t, almo&s;t grown out of Fa&s;hion. La&s;tly, the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> is &s;aid, to have done great Service in the&s;e Complaints. Dr. <HI>Fordice</HI> relates &s;ix or &s;even remarkable Ca&s;es, in which he gave it with much Succe&s;s. Dr. <HI>Fothergill</HI> has likewi&s;e admini&s;tered the Bark in &s;crophulous Di&s;orders, and avers, that it may not only be given with Safety, but to manife&s;t Advantage, in certain Ca&s;es; however that it will not &s;ucceed in all. He has never known it avail much where the Bones were affected, nor where the &s;crophulous Tumor has been &s;o &s;ituated, as to be attended with much Pain, as in the Joints, or under the membranous Covers of the Mu&s;cles; for when the&s;e Parts are concerned, the <HI>Perio&s;teum</HI> &s;eldom e&s;capes without &s;ome Injury; in which Ca&s;e the Bone will be like|wi&s;e affected, and then, he is of Opinion, that the Bark will ha&s;ten the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e. The <HI>Cicuta Vulgaris</HI> has been al&s;o given in this, as well as in cancerous Ca&s;es, and, according to Dr. <HI>Storck,</HI> with very good Effect in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> however, in this Climate it &s;eems to fail, which confirms me in an Opinion, I have long entertain|ed, <HI>i. e.</HI> that various Plants have different Effects in different Countries, as well as on different Con|&s;titutions.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>After all, could a Specific be found out, of &s;uch a Nature, as equally to &s;uit the Con&s;titution of In|fants and Adults, Re&s;pect being had to the Do&s;e, which would act placidly, without &s;en&s;ible Evacu|ations, or ruffling the Habit; and as Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>per aliquas non patentes Vias</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edit. Libb. I. &amp; III. Epidem.

Such a Spe|cific we now offer the Public, which has &s;ucceeded in many, and all Ca&s;es where it has been hitherto admini&s;tered; and which is at this Time entru&s;ted to the farther Trial of a Gentleman of unque|&s;tionable Skill and Eminence in Ho&s;pital Practice, who&s;e Report of it cannot fail of being ab&s;olutely deci&s;ive and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s, however, to lay before the Public, an Account of the Succe&s;s it has had in tho&s;e Ca&s;es wherein it has been admini&s;tered by the Proprietors, though Per&s;ons but little &s;killed in the Art of Medicine.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>CASES</HI> of &s;everal Per&s;ons who have been cured by this <HI>MEDICINE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> Patient, to whom it was admini&s;tered, was Mr. <HI>William King,</HI> of <HI>St. Mary Magdalen Bermond&s;ey, Southwark;</HI> who, at that Time, had been long afflicted with the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> and had near forty running Ulcers, many of them on the Joints, by which he was greatly emaciated, and thought con&s;umptive. The Bones were carious, many rotten Pieces came away from his Legs, and he was, by the Surgeons who attended him, deemed incurable. Yet this Man was per|fectly re&s;tored by the above-mentioned Medicine; and to &s;atisfy &s;ome Gentlemen at <HI>Paris,</HI> who wanted
<PB N="13" REF="12">to be properly informed of the Fact, he made an Affidavit of his being cured by this Medicine, be|fore Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Hankey,</HI> in Pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Weldon,</HI> the Notary Public, who&s;e Te&s;timonial bears Date the 15th of <HI>February</HI> 1752.</P>
<P>The next Per&s;on, to whom it was admini&s;tered, was Mr. <HI>John Deane,</HI> of <HI>Saffron Hill,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Andrew Holborn.</HI> This Patient, when he took the Medicine, had been afflicted with the <HI>Evil</HI> &s;even or eight Years; which began with a Swelling in his left Eye, and the Glands of his Neck. He had, at the Time of his fir&s;t taking it, many running Ulcers, which had been often opened with Cau&s;tics, and he was inform|ed by the Surgeons of one of our Ho&s;pitals, to whom he had applied for Relief, that his Di&s;|order was incurable. Mr. <HI>Deane,</HI> however, was &s;oon cured by this Medicine, and in the Cour&s;e of near eleven Years has had no Return of the Di&s;|order. Soon after the Cure was perfected he mar|ried, and has had &s;everal healthy Children.

<P><Q>"During my Stay at <HI>Paris,</HI> which has been more than &s;ix Months, I have daily frequented the Ho&s;pitals, and had an Opportunity of &s;ee|ing the good Effects of your Pills for the Cure of the <HI>Evil,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Cartier</HI> has admini&s;tered under the In&s;pection of the Phy&s;icians. I think he has eight Patients, all mi&s;erable Objects, but
<PB N="14" REF="13">I cannot help mentioning particularly the a&s;to|ni&s;hing Effect it has had on a <HI>German,</HI> born at <HI>Deux Ponts,</HI> whom I have often interrogated re&s;pecting his Complaint. The Di&s;temper be|gan in his great Toe; but by &s;ome Applications, u&s;ed by the Surgeons, the Humour was repelled and fixed in his right Leg, where it broke out in eight Ulcers, which being ob&s;tinate it was a|greed, in a Con&s;ultation of Phy&s;icians and Sur|geons, to take off the Leg; but his Parents not con&s;enting, other Methods were u&s;ed to prevent the Di&s;order from &s;preading, tho' without Ef|fect; for he continually grew wor&s;e, and, after he had been in this deplorable Way for eight Years, his Parents &s;ent him to <HI>Paris.</HI> Here he arrived in <HI>June</HI> 1748, and entered the <HI>Hotel-Dieu,</HI> in <HI>St. Andrew</HI>'s Ward; where he continu|ed two Years, and during that Time grew wor&s;e, on which he was di&s;charged the Ward as incu|rable, and &s;ent into the <HI>Salle d'O&s;ier,</HI> where he took your Medicine. He had, at this Time, twenty-one running Ulcers, eight of them were on his right Foot, and eight on his right Hand, the U&s;e of which he had entirely lo&s;t. He had likewi&s;e a large Swelling under each Arm, the Glands on each Side his Throat were &s;welled as big as an Hen-Egg, and he had five running Ulcers in his Neck. After he had taken your Medicine about eight Months his Ulcers all heal|ed, the U&s;e of his Hand was re&s;tored, the Swel|lings broke and healed, and the Man is now in perfect Health. I have no other View, in &s;ending you this Account, but to induce you to make it public in <HI>England;</HI> for it is hard that your fellow Citizens &s;hould be deprived of &s;uch a Benefit."</Q></P>

He took this Medicine, and was perfectly cured; for, though nine Years are elap&s;ed, he has had no Return of his Complaint, but has enjoyed an exceeding good Share of Health, and is remarkably active and &s;trong.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>John Morgan,</HI> Cutler, now living at Mr. <HI>Savigny</HI>'s in <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> was afflicted with this Di&s;|order, and admitted into one of our Ho&s;pitals for Cure, where his Tumors were &s;everal times laid open, and, be&s;ides taking other Medicines, he drank a very large Quantity of Sea-Water, but without the lea&s;t Benefit. After he came from the Ho&s;pital he applied for this Medicine, which he began to take about <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> 1755. The <HI>Octo|ber</HI> following, he found him&s;elf abundantly better, and in the next Spring all his Ulcers were entirely healed, without any Lo&s;s of Time, or Interruption in Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<PB N="16" REF="15">di&s;charged as incurable. He was after this admit|ted into another Ho&s;pital, where he continued four|teen Weeks, and was al&s;o thence di&s;charged as in|curable. At this Time he had five running Sores in one Arm, and three in the other; one of which was directly in the Joint of the Elbow. He had al&s;o Ulcers in his Neck and Face; many of which had been opened with Cau&s;tics, and could not af|terwards be healed. In this Situation his Friends applied for the Medicine, which is the Subject of this Pamphlet. After he had taken it &s;ome little Time, there was a large Di&s;charge from all the Ulcers, and in about two or three Months he was abundantly better in Health. He continued taking the Medicine as directed, and by De|grees all the Wounds healed up, and he has been now four Years perfectly well.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Hiller,</HI> of <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> has a Daugh|ter who was long afflicted with this Di&s;order, and which &s;eized her when &s;he was about two Years old. She applied to one of the Ho&s;pitals for Re|lief, and was continued two Years as an Out-Patient, but received no Benefit, either by the Medicines &s;he had there, or by what was applied by others. When &s;he fir&s;t entered upon a Cour&s;e of this Me|dicine her right Foot was very much &s;welled and ulcerated, and the Bone foul. She had a large Ul|cer in her Hand, and another in the Middle of her right Cheek. After &s;he had taken this Me|dicine
<PB N="18" REF="17">&s;ome Time, the Ulcers began to heal, and &s;he is now perfectly well.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Amer,</HI> of the Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Giles's, Crip|plegate,</HI> in the City of <HI>London,</HI> was &s;eized with this Di&s;order, and in the Space of two Years had a Tu|mor ulcerated in his Thigh, another in his Arm near the Elbow, the third Finger on his left Hand was much &s;welled, and had an Ulcer by the mid|dle Joint that ran quite through the Finger, the Bone of which was foul, and during the Cure &s;e|veral rotten Pieces exfoliated, and came away. A Surgeon, who lived in the Neighbourhood, told his Friends, that it was a very bad Ca&s;e, and ad|vi&s;ed them to take him to an Ho&s;pital. Accord|ingly, he was an Out-Patient at one of our Ho&s;|pitals for &s;ome Months, when the Surgeons &s;aid they could do him no Service, unle&s;s his Finger was taken off. Upon this he went to Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> and was under his Care for twelve Months, during which Time he grew much wor&s;e, and his Health was &s;o much impaired, when Application was made for this Medicine, that his Friends did not expect him to live a Month. This Medicine, how|ever, &s;oon re&s;tored him to better Health, and by Degrees all his Ulcers healed, and he has now the perfect U&s;e of his Limbs, and has continued well ever &s;ince the Ulcers were fir&s;t healed, which is now &s;omewhat more than two Years.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Banni&s;ter,</HI> who keeps a Stable-yard in <HI>Old Bond-&s;treet,</HI> has a Daughter who was much afflicted with a &s;crophulous Di&s;order.

She had al&s;o a Tumor on one Arm, and the Di&s;order had much affected her Eyes: After taking various Medicines, without re|ceiving any Benefit, &s;he was perfectly cured by this.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Chandler,</HI> at Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s, Watchmaker
<PB N="19" REF="18">in <HI>Chi&s;well-&s;treet, London,</HI> was afflicted with this Di&s;order. It fir&s;t made its Appearance by a Swelling of the Glands in his Neck, which being greatly encrea&s;ed in the Space of a Month, he went to a Surgeon, who applied a Poultice to the Part, and after &s;ome Time opened it with a Cau&s;tic, but the Wound thus made was &s;o ob&s;tinate that it could not be healed. And another Tumor &s;oon came in his Neck, which encrea&s;ed to a great De|gree, and in Time affected his Shoulder, and ren|dered him unable to pur&s;ue his Bu&s;ine&s;s. In this State he was admitted into one of our Ho&s;pitals, where he continued nine Weeks, and was &s;everal times lanced, but without obtaining any Relief. He then put him&s;elf under the Care of a foreign Phy&s;ician, who undertook to cure him; but the Di&s;|order &s;till increa&s;ing, and his Health, as well as his Ulcers, growing wor&s;e, he, in <HI>February</HI> la&s;t, ap|plied for this Medicine. At this Time he had &s;e|veral very bad Ulcers about his Neck, and his left Brea&s;t, all of which healed after he had taken the Pills a few Months, and he is now (<HI>Dec.</HI> 13, 1762) perfectly well, and has been &s;o for &s;ome Time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>St. Paul's Church-yard,</HI> had a Child about three Years old, who had many &s;trumous Swellings in the Neck, that were very large, hard, and &s;o ob&s;ti|nate, as not to &s;ubmit to any of the common Me|thods of Treatment; which the Father informing Dr. BEVIS of, that Gentleman, agreeable to his u&s;ual Candour and Humanity, advi&s;ed him to apply for this Remedy, having him&s;elf experien|ced the good Effects of it on two Patients before. The Child took the Medicine about two Months, which gave it no Sort of Unea&s;ine&s;s, and the Swel|lings entirely di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Since this Pamphlet was put to the Pre&s;s, (that is to &s;ay, this 17th of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1762) we received a Let|ter from the Rev. Mr. BROWNE, Vicar of <HI>Olney,</HI> near <HI>Newport Pagnel,</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> (the well known Author of the <HI>Sunday Thoughts,</HI> and other valuable
<PB N="20" REF="19">Pieces) of which Letter the following is an Extract.</P>
<P><Q>"Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that in a Di&s;tem|per of &s;o loath&s;ome a Kind, as this of the <HI>King's Evil,</HI> mo&s;t Per&s;ons &s;how a Delicacy in having their Names made public. I have, therefore, concealed the Name of a female Patient; the o|thers I here communicate to you to print or con|ceal as you think proper, it being to them indif|ferent: But the Facts are certain and notori|ous; and it will be of Weight with all con&s;ide|rate Per&s;ons to have it publicly adverti&s;ed, that any who propo&s;e them&s;elves for Cure, and want farther Satisfaction, may receive all they can de|&s;ire, in this Particular, from the Parties who were cured, or from me at <HI>Olney</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> where the Cures here mentioned were performed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"JOHN BUTCHER, <HI>Baker,</HI> an Inhabitant of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Olney</HI> in <HI>Bucks,</HI> about thirty Years of Age (from a violent Blow, as was thought, of a large Piece of Wood falling on him) had a Con|tu&s;ion and Swelling on the No&s;e, which increa&s;ed and grew very much inflamed with livid and o|ther alarming Appearances. He had the Ad|vice of &s;everal Surgeons, Apothecaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both here and at <HI>Northampton;</HI> was purged, dieted, bled, lanced, and had &s;everal Fomen|tations applied to the Part, together with Salves and other topical Applications, for the Space of a Year and a Quarter. The Di&s;order, however, grew wor&s;e, and by general Con&s;ent his Ca&s;e was adjudged an inveterate and incura|ble <HI>Strumae.</HI> He was, from a florid Counte|nance and robu&s;t Make, now become wan as a Corp&s;e, emaciated to a mere Skeleton, and lay unable to feed, turn, or do any the lea&s;t Of|fices for him&s;elf, being as feeble as an Infant. The whole Bone of the No&s;e grew carious, ex|foliated, and came all away; the Fle&s;h of the upper Lip was eaten entirely off, and left the Jaw and Teeth bare, and his Speech became &s;o hollow and inarticulate, that tho&s;e who were
<PB N="21" REF="20">mo&s;tly with him could hardly under&s;tand a Word he &s;aid, and all about him daily expect|ed his Death. He could take nothing but a little Pap, or &s;oft liquid Food, admini&s;tered to him in a Boat, as they do to Infants in the Month; and his medical A&s;&s;i&s;tants had all left him. In this deplorable Ca&s;e I found him, ex|ceedingly de&s;irous of Life; his Appetite &s;trong and craving, and he had &s;ome Degree of in|ward Strength, which gave me Hopes. I im|mediately advi&s;ed your Medicine; it was tried, and he found almo&s;t pre&s;ent, and (in u&s;ing it about three Months) a&s;toni&s;hing Benefit; the fetid Di&s;charge and Ulcers were removed and healed, the other Parts grew well; he got up, eat, became hearty as ever, went abroad, and I my&s;elf &s;aw and &s;poke with him at a Place he had walked to above two Miles from Home on Bu&s;ine&s;s, which he was now very well able to perform. This was in the Summer about five or &s;ix Months after his fir&s;t taking the Medicine. He worked from that Time at Carting, Hedging, and other robu&s;t Labours; helped at getting in Harve&s;t that Year, and &s;eemed as able as any of them; and I believe, and &s;o do his Friends, that he is now as free from the <HI>Evil</HI> as any Per&s;on whatever; and has continued well ever &s;ince the Cure was performed, which is &s;omewhat more than two Years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"You are to ob&s;erve by the way, that his was &s;u&s;pected to be a Family Di&s;order. One Bro|ther, if not more having died of it, and he has a Si&s;ter, older than him&s;elf, who is now in the la&s;t Stage of a Con&s;umption, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"An Inhabitant of the Town afore&s;aid who was upwards of thirteen Years old, has been for &s;everal Years afflicted with the <HI>King's Evil;</HI> had &s;ore Eyes, and hard &s;trumous Tumors in the Glands of the Throat, as is common in tho&s;e Ca&s;es. Mr. THOMAS ASPRAY, Surgeon
<PB N="22" REF="21">and Apothecary in this Town, undertook her Cure with your Medicine, and al&s;o applied Bli|&s;ters on the Sides near her Ears to promote the Di&s;charge of Matter. She took the Pills regu|larly about three Months, and has continued now for about the &s;ame Time perfectly well.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"This Patient's Di&s;order is likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to be entailed on the Family, &s;everal of the Re|lations being in &s;ome Degree afflicted with it."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Browne</HI> relates another Ca&s;e more extraor|dinary than the former, of a Boy who had lo&s;t the U&s;e of one Foot with the <HI>Evil,</HI> whom he took in Hand, after the Surgeons had prepared to cut the Limb off. He has by this Medicine recovered the U&s;e of his Foot, but as the Boy is not yet per|fectly well, we &s;hall at pre&s;ent take no farther No|tice of his Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>One other Circum&s;tance we &s;hall mention, which will undoubtedly have great Weight with the Public. It is the Succe&s;s this Medicine has had on five Chil|dren in the Charity-hou&s;e called <HI>Burlington-&s;chool,</HI> in Old <HI>Burlington</HI> Street, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to whom it has been given under the In|&s;pection of a Gentleman, who&s;e Skill and Abilities have long di&s;tingui&s;hed him as one of the mo&s;t emi|nent of his Profe&s;&s;ion. Though we have not Per|mi&s;&s;ion to in&s;ert his Name, we cannot omit this Op|portunity of returning him our Thanks for his po|lite Behaviour and great Candour on that Occa&s;ion; and, we doubt not, but that Humanity which promp|ted him to &s;ee this Remedy admini&s;tred to the Children above-mentioned, will induce him to &s;peak of the Medicine as he thinks it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>The&s;e Children, previous to their taking the Me|dicine, were examined by the above-mentioned Gentleman, after they had been delared to be in a very bad State by a Surgeon of Character who had attended them. The Medicine was fir&s;t given them in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t. Two of them are cured, another nearly &s;o, and the other two are in a fair way of having their Health &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<P>More Evidence might be produced in Favour of this Medicine, and &s;ome Ca&s;es in&s;erted which are extremely &s;ingular; but many Per&s;ons, who have been cured, have de&s;ired to be concealed; among which are &s;everal Ladies who are &s;ince married, and have very healthy Children. Their Names, it is true, would do Honour to this Pamphlet, and greatly promote the U&s;e of the Medicine; but the Public will be plea&s;ed to con|&s;ider, that the Proprietors ought not, nay they cannot, break the Ties of Honour, and betray the Confidence repo&s;ed in them, though in Sup|port of Truth. The rea&s;onable Man, we appre|hend, will be &s;atisfied with what is above related, yet &s;hould there be any &s;o incredulous, as to require farther Conviction, re&s;pecting the Safety and Efficacy of this Medicine, they may obtain it, and be introduc|ed to the Proprietors, by applying to the Publi&s;her of this Pamphlet.</P>

<P>A MEDICINE has been di&s;covered (which is an Alterative, and therefore the better adapted to all Con&s;titutions) that effectually eradicates tho&s;e Di&s;|orders in a &s;hort Time, and, during that Interval, vi&s;ibly amends and &s;trengthens the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That this is a Truth, will be made manife&s;t by a Number of Patients who have been cured by this Medicine, even after they were di&s;charged as incu|rable from the Ho&s;pitals, and who are at all Times ready to be examined in the mo&s;t &s;trict and &s;crupu|lous Manner.

<P>Nor is this Application made with a View of rai&s;ing any Money; it is intended only to try whether a Sum &s;ufficient can be rai&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;mall Ho&s;pital, in Ca&s;e the Proprietors &s;hall make every Allegation appear to the entire Satisfaction of the Public: All that is intreated therefore for the pre&s;ent, is, that every LADY and GENTLEMAN, inclined to promote this cha|ritable Undertaking, will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify what Sum they would chu&s;e to contribute yearly or otherwi&s;e; when they are &s;atisfied of the Truth of what is here a&s;&s;erted, and &s;ee the Scheme carried into Execution by Per&s;ons of their own Appointment.</P>
<P>Books will be opened for the Names of tho&s;e who are charitably inclined to encourage this Undertak|ing; and, when a &s;ufficient Number are collected, a Place of Meeting will be appointed, by an Ad|verti&s;ement in the <HI>London Gazette,</HI> and other Pa|pers, to elect proper Per&s;ons for the Management of the Charity, and to &s;ee the Te&s;timonials, and examine the Patients who have been cured.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 18, 1763.</P>
<P>FROM the Truths &s;et forth in the preced|ing Pamphlet, and the Candid and humane Propo&s;al which the Proprietors made to the Public re&s;pecting an Ho&s;pital for the Cure of the Evil, added to their extreme Readine&s;s on all Oc|ca&s;ions to give their Medicines and Attendance to the Poor <HI>gratis:</HI> From the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I &s;ay, one would have thought that all who had &s;een the Effects of this Medicine, and the ea&s;y Manner in which it eradicated the Di&s;order, would, for the general Good, have lent their Aid towards pro|moting its U&s;e. It was what the Proprietors flat|tered them&s;elves with; but how far they have been mi&s;taken, will appear in the following Narrative.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1762, a Surgeon of the fir&s;t Eminence for his well known Humanity, Candour, and Abi|lities, was accidentally informed by a Gentleman then in Company with him, that a Medicine had been di&s;covered, which had cured great Numbers of the Evil, even in the wor&s;t State of the Di&s;or|der; the Surgeon an&s;wered, that for the Benefit of Mankind, he mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hed it might prove &s;o, and be brought into general Practice, for that this was one of the De&s;iderata in the Art of Healing; adding withal, that he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee the Parties concerned, and be further informed of the Matter. Some Days after this, one of the Proprietors waited on this Gentleman with &s;ome of the Medicine, and took with him &s;everal Per&s;ons who had been cured by it, to give their Te&s;timony of the Truth. After he had ex|amined
<PB N="2" REF="25">amined the&s;e Patients, with re&s;pect to the Situation they were in at the Time they fir&s;t took the Medi|cine, and had &s;een the Scars of the Ulcers that had been healed, he acknowledged that the Cures were very extraordinary, and then &s;aid, that there were &s;ome Children afflicted with this Di&s;order in <HI>Burlington</HI> School, in <HI>Old Burlington-&s;treet,</HI> which was maintained by Sub&s;cription, and it would be a Charity to cure them. This was readily agreed to, and five Children were examined, four of which were undertaken, as their Di&s;order evidently appeared to be the Evil; but the fifth &s;eemed to have a Complaint of a different Nature; however, the Medicine was given to them all. At the Time when this Medicine was fir&s;t admini&s;tered to the Children, a Gentleman of the Faculty, who had examined them, &s;miled at the Attempt, and &s;aid there was no Cure for them; however, his Prog|no&s;tication has proved him no Conjuror, for in the Space of nine Months, two of the four which were undertaken, were perfectly cured; &s;ince that another is got well, and in all Probability the fourth would have received a Cure e'er this Time, but for the following Accident.</P>
<P>In <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, the preceding Di&s;&s;ertation on the King's Evil was made public, in which the Reader will ob&s;erve, there are &s;et forth for the Satisfaction of the Public the Ca&s;es of many Per|&s;ons who have been cured by this Medicine; and among others, &s;ome Notice is taken of the Children above mentioned. This naturally led tho&s;e who were them&s;elves afflicted with this Di&s;order, or had Friends in that deplorable State, to enquire con|cerning the Medicine, at this Place as well as o|thers; and during the Time that Mrs. <HI>Martin</HI> con|tinued Governe&s;s of the Hou&s;e, who was a hu|mane, di&s;creet, and worthy Woman, the Children were &s;hewn to them, and they obtained the nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="3" REF="26">Information; but Mrs. <HI>Martin</HI> declining that Office to go and live with her Daughter, who was then married, another Per&s;on was appointed to the Tru&s;t; who, for Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to her&s;elf, or to her Coadjutors, thought proper to behave in a rude Manner to the Gentleman who attended, and not only &s;o, but to fal&s;ify the Truth, and mi&s;|lead tho&s;e who came to enquire of her concerning the Children; which &s;he did to &s;everal, and parti|cularly to Mrs. <HI>Baker,</HI> as will evidently appear by her Atte&s;tation.</P>
<P>The Manner of her Behaviour Mrs. <HI>Baker</HI> ge|nerou&s;ly and fairly di&s;clo&s;ed to the Proprietors of the Medicine, upon which Application was made to the Surgeon, at who&s;e In&s;tance the Cure of the Children was undertaken. He, being greatly irri|tated at &s;uch &s;hameful and injurious Behaviour, de&s;ired a Committee of the Hou&s;e might be cal|led, and &s;aid the Truth &s;hould not be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. A Committee accordingly met the 21&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> 1763, and this Gentleman attended. The Affair was en|quired into, and it apperead, that two of the Chil|dren were perfectly cured, and had left the Hou&s;e; and <HI>Mary Somers,</HI> another of them, was called be|fore the Board, and upon &s;trict Examination, was found, and declared, to be perfectly well. The Woman that had behaved &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly was then called, and Mrs. <HI>Baker,</HI> who for the Sake of Truth was &s;o kind as to attend, told the Committee the whole of her Behaviour to her, when &s;he came to enquire concerning the Cure of the Children. The Woman at fir&s;t equivocated, but at la&s;t &s;he confe&s;&s;|ed the Truth, a&s;ked Pardon, and &s;aid, &s;he was &s;orry for what &s;he had done. The Gentlemen of the Committee then a&s;ked her, who put her upon giving &s;uch An&s;wers? But all they could get from her was, that a tall Gentleman had been there, and talked to her about it, but &s;he did not know his Name. She
<PB N="4" REF="27">was then &s;everely reproved; and the Committee de|&s;ired the Proprietor of the Medicine &s;till to attend on the other Girl who was not yet well, and complete the Cure. This was agreed to; but when he came to the Hou&s;e, &s;ome Days after, to give her more Medicines, he found this Woman, who was &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and penitent before the Committee, more in&s;olent than ever. Upon which he applied at two &s;ub&s;equent Committees to have Ju&s;tice done to his Character, and to the Medicine; but as the Gen|tlemen were not there who &s;at at the fir&s;t Committee, he could obtain no Satisfaction, and therefore left the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>That <HI>Mary Somers</HI> was cured, appeared by her Examination before the Committee above-men|tioned; but &s;he is now in the Hou&s;e, and may be examined again and again. And that <HI>Su&s;annah</HI> or <HI>Suckey Pott</HI> (for they &s;ay &s;he was &s;o chri&s;tened) and <HI>Elizabeth Morris,</HI> were cured, will appear by the following Certificates.</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. Baker's Atte&s;tation.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Saturday</HI> the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> 1763, I went to <HI>Burlington</HI> School to enquire after &s;ome Chil|dren, who, in a Pamphlet lately publi&s;hed on the Evil, were &s;aid to be cured of that Di&s;order. Here I &s;aw one of the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who &s;aid there had been no Children cured there. Upon this I a&s;ked, if I could &s;ee any of the Children who had taken the Medicine? After &s;ome Time and He&s;itation, two of them were called, and I a&s;ked one of them, who&s;e Name I find is <HI>Mary Somers,</HI> if &s;he had taken the Alterative and purging Pills for the Evil? She &s;aid &s;he had. I then a&s;ked her, if &s;he had taken any other Medicine during that Time, or &s;ince? She &s;aid &s;he had not, and declared be|fore her Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;he was perfectly well, and that
<PB N="5" REF="28">&s;he had been the wor&s;t of them all. Upon which the Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed greatly confounded, and to ex|cu&s;e her&s;elf, &s;aid the Girl had never told her &s;o be|fore. I replied, that a Cure of this Sort ought not to be concealed, and that I thought it a very cha|ritable Action of the Gentlemen concerned in the Medicine to Cure the Children of &s;uch a terrible Di&s;order. In an&s;wer to which &s;he &s;aid, there were proper Per&s;ons to give the Children Medicines, and that they wanted no Charity, nor de&s;ired any Body to trouble them&s;elves about them. She far|ther &s;aid, that &s;everal Per&s;ons had been there to enquire concerning the Cure of the Children, and that &s;he had given them their An&s;wer.</P>
<P>After this, by the de&s;ire of &s;ome Gentlemen concerned in the Charity, I attended at one of the Committees, held at the Hou&s;e, which I think was on the 21&s;t of the &s;ame Month, and this Af|fair was enquired into; <HI>Mary Somers,</HI> who was then examined, was perfectly cured, and it ap|peared that two others had al&s;o been cured, and had left the Hou&s;e; for a Surgeon, who attend|ed, declared before the Committee, that he had examined them before they took the Medicine and &s;ince, and that before they took the Medicine they had the Evil, and now they were well. The Wo|man, who had denied the Truth to me, and be|haved &s;o impertinently, was al&s;o called, and charg|ed with it. At fir&s;t &s;he equivocated, but after|wards acknowledged that &s;he did &s;ay none of the Children were cured, and that &s;he was &s;orry for what &s;he had &s;aid, and a&s;ked Pardon. Upon be|ing a&s;ked who put her upon giving &s;uch An&s;wers? She &s;aid, that a tall Gentleman had been there, and talked to her about it; but &s;he did not know his Name.</P>

<P>Now, if there were no &s;uch Things in the World as Pride, Envy and Avarice, it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to account for this Sort of Behaviour; or to a&s;&s;ign any Rea&s;on why a Man, who had given up his Time, his Trouble, and his Medicines to Cure a Parcel of poor Children, of a Di&s;order general|ly accounted Incurable, &s;hould <HI>at la&s;t</HI> be in&s;ulted for his Pains; but the&s;e, and a few other Qualities which are often harboured in the human Brea&s;t, will help to unfold the Mi&s;tery. The Injury, however, which the Proprietors of the Medicine have received by this Kind of Treatment, bears no Proportion to what the People have &s;uffered, who, by thus enquiring, have been thus mi&s;led. The fir&s;t have been deprived only of a little pecu|niary Advantage, or perhaps none at all (for the Medicines have been always given to the Poor) but the la&s;t may have been deprived of the Means of recovering their Health, and pre&s;erving their Lives.</P>
<P>As Orders have been received for this Medicine from different Parts of <HI>Europ&egrave;,</HI> as well as from the Continent of <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Proprietors find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ell it out in Par|cels, as other Medicines u&s;ually are.
