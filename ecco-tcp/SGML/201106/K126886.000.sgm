<HEAD>SKETCH for a MEDICAL EDUCATION. by J*L. M D. F R S.</HEAD>
<P>After having attained a competent knowledge of the Languages nece&s;&s;ary to acquire tho&s;e Sciences that are requi&s;ite to the &s;tudy of Medicine; and to enable the Student to read and con&s;ult the va|rious Authors that have written on Phy|&s;ic. MATHEMATICS claims his fir&s;t attention.</P>
<P>Without the knowledge of Mathe|matics it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand NA|TURAL PHILOSOPHY, a Science by which the Laws, and Oeconomy of na|ture, and the Human body, can only be under&s;tood; as al&s;o the many cau&s;es that operate upon men and all nature.</P>
<P>ANATOMY being the foundation of medical knowledge, it is therefore to be &s;tudied with the greate&s;t care and attention. Its intricacy al&s;o requires the aid of the be&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors; and that the Pupil him&s;elf practice frequent di&s;&s;ections to attain this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary part of a Medical Education. Without the know|ledge of Anatomy, it is impo&s;&s;ible either
<PB N="2" REF="7">to di&s;cover the &s;eat, nature, or cure, of Di&s;ea&s;es. In Surgery no operation can be performed with &s;afety or with much probability of &s;ucce&s;s to the Patient. From di&s;&s;ections he likewise learns the nature of many hidden Di&s;orders, and when &s;imilar &s;ymptoms occur to know the Di&s;ea&s;e under which the Patient la|bours. It al&s;o enables, the Phy&s;ician or Surgeon when called upon by a Court of Ju&s;tice, to determine with certainty whether Death has been occa&s;ioned from a natural cau&s;e, or from violence; hence he becomes the means of acquitting the innocent, and of condemning the guilty; but if ignorant of Anatomy, perhaps the contrary.</P>
<P>CHEMISTRY is an other nece&s;&s;ary part of a Medical Education, as with|out a knowledge of it we mu&s;t ever be ig|norant of the various chemical Proce&s;&s;es that are constantly going on in the Ani|mal oeconomy upon whom depends health or di&s;ea&s;e, and from a true knowledge of whom, we are greatly in&s;tucted how to pre&s;erve the fir&s;t, and to cure the latter al&s;o the Phy&s;ician is liable to give Pre|&s;criptions that cannot be compounded or
<PB N="3" REF="8">if they could, He is ignorant of the means by which it can be done. Some efficacious medicines he frequently de&s;|troys by his injudicious compo&s;itions, while other &s;ub&s;tances even innocent and inert ones, are rendered injurious and highly poi&s;onous.</P>
<P>A knowledge of the MATERIA-MEDICA is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to every prac|titioner of Medicine, without which he is ignorant of the means of cure, notwith|&s;tanding the Di&s;ea&s;e is known to him: Al&s;o, altho he is acquainted with the powers of a few medicines, he will find him&s;elf foiled for want of a more extended knowledge of the Materia-Medica, the con&s;titutions of &s;ome people, differing as much from that of mankind in general: as if they were of a different Species. Therefore what proves u&s;eful in a di&s;|ea&s;e with mo&s;t people, with &s;ome it may be injurious.</P>
<P>The Materia-Medica being an ex|ten&s;ive Science, requiring the aid of me|thod, BOTANY and NATURAL-HIS|TORY &s;hould therefore make a part of the education of every Phy&s;ician; the knowledge of them al&s;o helps to abridge
<PB N="4" REF="9">the &s;tudy of the Materia-Medica, there being frequently an analogy in the vir|tues of bodies of the &s;ame Genus.</P>
<P>Lectures on the THEORY of ME|DICINE, may now be &s;tudied. In this cour&s;e is al&s;o taught PHYSEOLOGY &amp; PATHOLOGY, both ab&s;olutely requi|&s;ite to a Medical Education. Although the different Sy&s;tems of Phy&s;ic are im|perfect, yet as they &s;erve for a clew to guide and direct a Phy&s;ician in his pro|cedure of Cure, by keeping him from confounding one thing with an other, they are therefore of the greate&s;t utility in the Practice of Medicine; more e&s;pe|cially as all Practitioners have a natural tendancy to empirici&s;m.</P>
<P>The PRACTICE of PHYSIC is the la&s;t, and chief de&s;ign, of medical &s;tudy. This part of medical knowledge is to be attained from hearing the Lectu|res of eminent Profe&s;&s;ors, and by reading, but particularly by attending Ho&s;pitals, where Clinical Lectures are delivered to the Students, in which are generally given the Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;ea&s;e under which the Patient labours, the purpo&s;e propo&s;ed, for the admini&s;tering, of this
<PB N="5" REF="10">or that medicine, and their effects up|on the Patient pointed out; la&s;tly if the patient dies, the cau&s;e of his death is more evidently pointed out and &s;hown to the Students, by the di&s;&s;ecton of the morbid body.</P>
