<HEAD>An ESSAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT is the unavoidable Fate of every Thing that makes its Appearance new in the World, to be attended with Mi&s;repre&s;entations: The malicious Genius of &s;ome People naturally leads them to Cen&s;ure and Detraction, e&s;pecially where they have &s;uch an agreeable Opportunity of exerting their beloved Talents, as is afforded to them by a|ny Propo&s;al, however ju&s;t in it &s;elf, that has not been approved of by the Practice of for|mer Times, in the very Place where they hap|pen to live, nor &s;upported by the Authority of a Multitude there. Others imagine, that they have an Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e any new Scheme, and therefore are very Sanguine again&s;t it, al|tho' they are often found to be mi&s;erably mi&s;|taken in their Opinion, even as to their own particular Concerns. A third Sort, which make up indeed by far the mo&s;t numerous Cla&s;s of
<PB N="4" REF="3">Detractors, are tho&s;e who go blindly in to what they hear others &s;ay, without giving them&s;elves the lea&s;t Trouble to examine the Ca&s;e; they are plea&s;ed with the Slander, and catch the Laugh, for what Rea&s;on they cannot tell, and think of the Matter they don't know how, but ju&s;t as they are put upon, and directed by the Hints &s;ugge&s;ted to them by ill natured or de|&s;igning Per&s;ons. Every new Project then mu&s;t appear with great Di&s;advantages; e&s;pecially in a narrow Place, and where the Judgments of Men are too apt to be guided by the Opini|ons or Examples of others, and where Rea&s;on is &s;eldom allowed to lead any Man out of the common Road, how far &s;oever that may hap|pen to be wrong in it &s;elf. An Innovation in any of the liberal Arts or Sciences, or in the Method of exerci&s;ing them, and rendering them u&s;eful to Mankind, &s;ince it cannot ex|pect to be the Darling of any one Party of Men more than of another, and con&s;equently can look for no Patrons out of any Party-Views, which are the Ma&s;ter-Springs of all our Actions at pre&s;ent in this unhappy Country; &s;o it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with extraordinary Di&s;cou|ragement. Yet certain it is, that there are &s;o many Errors committed in the Exerci&s;e of the learned Profe&s;&s;ions, that the World reaps but a &s;mall Part of the Advantages that naturally ought to ari&s;e from them. This then, if it be
<PB N="5" REF="4">true, (as unque&s;tionably it is) mu&s;t needs give &s;ome Satisfaction to the Mind of any Per&s;on, who, in his own Faculty, would endea|vour to remove tho&s;e Ob&s;tacles which &s;tand in the Way of his Profe&s;&s;ion, and in a great Mea|&s;ure prevent the u&s;efulne&s;s of it; notwith&s;tand|ing of the forbidding Circum&s;tances which the Novelty of the Thing may bring along with it: And if the Project laid down by &s;uch a Per&s;on, is of it &s;elf rea&s;onable, it is the Propo&s;er's Du|ty to let the World know that it is &s;o. And if he be able to &s;atisfie the judicious Part of Mankind, who don't judge of Matters before they con&s;ider them; and the Candid, who judge with impartiality, he may &s;afely treat the O|pinion of all others with the utmo&s;t Con|tempt.</P>
<P>THE Knowledge of Medicine, which we at pre&s;ent only con&s;ider, is undoubtedly one of the mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;&s;ings ever Heaven be|&s;towed upon this lower World: But as it is now exerci&s;ed, it may &s;afely be a&s;&s;erted, and can be prov'd, that the Benefit of it is but &s;mall to this Nation, and e&s;pecially to this City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and that plainly from two Rea|&s;ons: The Fir&s;t is, the Ignorance of many of the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, that is, of &s;uch as actually practi&s;e it; and the Second, which has as bad Effects, is the Difficulty that mo&s;t Part of Peo|ple find to have the Advice of tho&s;e who are
<PB N="6" REF="5">to be pre&s;umed the be&s;t qualified, on Account, that their Fees are too con&s;iderable for the Sick Per&s;on's Pocket. Now the Rich among&s;t us, bear but a &s;mall Proportion to the poorer Sort. If many then mu&s;t be without the Benefit of Medicine regularly apply'd, whil&s;t a few only can purcha&s;e it, certainly the Service it does to the Community is but incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>THE natural Way to put the Practice of this Art into the mo&s;t proper Hands, and &s;o to exclude the more ignorant from it, (which was the Royal De&s;ign of the Sovereign, in ere|cting a College of Phy&s;icians in this Place, al|tho' that De&s;ign has not hitherto &s;ucceeded) would certainly be, for the Phy&s;icians to make &s;uch a Regulation with Re&s;pect to their Fees, that every Per&s;on, when indi&s;po&s;ed, might be able to call them: If they would, for Example, accept of &s;uch a &s;mall Thing, at a Time, as Half a Crown, and be paid for each Vi&s;it at the &s;ame Rate. And le&s;t it &s;hould be alledged, that this were either pro&s;tituting the Art, or &s;acrificing their own Intere&s;t to the Good of the Publick (a Thing which, altho' noble, is not always convenient) let them con&s;ider the following Particulars, and it is highly proba|ble they will change their Opinion; and per|haps be convinced, that they have no Manner of Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e &s;uch a Scheme.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>IT can be prov'd in the fir&s;t Place, that a &s;mall Fee, at a Time, to a Phy&s;ician for his Ad|vice, &s;atisfies the mo&s;t Learned and Knowing Practitioners of mo&s;t Part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2do, THAT, were it the general Practice here to take &s;uch Fees, Phy&s;icians would be more univer&s;ally imploy'd than they are, ac|quire more Honour, and do infinitely more Service to the Lieges.</P>
<P N="3">3tio, THAT the well imployed of the Fa|culty could lo&s;e nothing by this Method, but rather gain; and that the le&s;s imployed would gain va&s;tly, by &s;ome Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s nece&s;|&s;arily falling into their Hands.</P>
<P N="4">4to, THAT the Chirurgeon Apothecaries, whom it would &s;eem mo&s;tly to affect, could lo&s;e nothing, but would gain upon &s;everal Accounts.</P>
<P N="5">5to, THAT from the foregoing Con&s;idera|tions, it would be highly beneficial to the Country, that this Method were introduced, and that it would do Prejudice to no one Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Particular; Tho&s;e who know how Phy&s;icians are paid in <HI>Holland,</HI> where it is confe&s;t by every Body, there are Men of as great Learning in that Profe&s;&s;ion as any where el&s;e at pre&s;ent; how they are paid all over <HI>Germany, Elanders, France</HI> it &s;elf, and
<PB N="8" REF="7">every where but in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> won't di&s;|pute, That the be&s;t Phy&s;icians are contented with &s;mall Fees, and con&s;equently mu&s;t think it no Di&s;grace for any one of the Faculty to be &s;atisfy'd with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Particular is as little doubtful; For if one could have the be&s;t Advice about their Health for a &s;mall Acknowledgment, no doubt they would call for that Advice, rather than for any other; and the lea&s;t Di&s;|order would willingly make them part with Half a Crown, when perhaps, to &s;ave a Gui|nea, the Di&s;temper is allowed to go on, with|out calling any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or at lea&s;t, not that of One who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to under&s;tand Di&s;tempers: Be&s;ides, many a one is able to pay a &s;mall Fee, who has not the Ability to pay a great one, and therefore mu&s;t take up with what Advice he can be&s;t purcha&s;e. The&s;e Con&s;iderations make it appear, That a more univer&s;al Practice mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend the lowering of the Fees.</P>
<P>BUT next, Phy&s;icians would acquire more Honour, and do more Good; becau&s;e by this Means they would have it in their Power, to ob&s;erve Di&s;ea&s;es from their fir&s;t Appearances, and by putting the Patient, from the Beginning, under a right Manage|ment, would, very often, effectually make
<PB N="9" REF="8">a Cure; when at pre&s;ent we know, they are &s;eldom called (except perhaps by the richer Sort, and that not always) 'till there is imminent Danger apprehended: And then the Doctor's Bu&s;ine&s;s commonly is, to skreen eve|ry Body el&s;e from any Reflections about the &s;ick Per&s;on's Death, and be a Witne&s;s of his Exit; when he him&s;elf knows very well, if he be a Per&s;on of Ingenuity and Learning, That he now can neither under&s;tand nor cure the Di&s;temper, &s;ince the Cour&s;e of it is alrea|dy perverted by a bad Management, or at lea&s;t not rectify'd in Time by a good one. It is a certain Fact, That Phy&s;icians, being commonly called in the End of a Di&s;ea&s;e, or after it has made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s, &s;el|dom &s;ee any one, as God and Nature &s;ent it; but as it is di&s;gui&s;ed and changed by Appli|cations made in the Beginning: And for this Rea&s;on they are able to do their Patients little or no Service, which has render'd the Art contemptible to &s;ome, and &s;u&s;pected to be of no great U&s;e, even by the mo&s;t knowing. It would then appear to be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of eve|ry true Phy&s;ician, to endeavour to retrieve the Honour of his own Art, by doing what he can, to bring the Practice into the Hands of the real Profe&s;&s;ors of it; which can never be done 'till the Fees are made low. And is it not the utmo&s;t Barbarity, to deny an Advice
<PB N="10" REF="9">to all who have not Ability to pay Gold, and too much Mode&s;ty to ask it for nothing?</P>
<P>WHAT was in the third Place a&s;&s;erted, <HI>That the well employed of the Faculty could lo&s;e nothing,</HI> appears by con&s;idering, that did they keep a Li&s;t of every Vi&s;it, and were paid at a certain Rate for it, it would often come to more Account than their Payments do at pre|&s;ent. People would know exactly what they expected for their Trouble, and de&s;ire their Attendance accordingly. The Richer, who at pre&s;ent give Gold, for their own greater Sati&s;|faction, would call them every Day, or oft|ner, during the Cour&s;e of a Di&s;temper. Others would call them now and then, and &s;o have the Benefit of good Directions, who at pre|&s;ent langui&s;h without them. And from this la&s;t Con&s;ideration it plainly appears, That there would be an Addition to the Gain, even of &s;uch as have their Reputation the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed: And as to the le&s;s employed, and younger Part of the Faculty, they mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be often in Bu&s;ine&s;s, whereas at pre|&s;ent they are idle, if Poor as well as Rich con&s;tantly &s;hould call Phy&s;icians; becau&s;e in that Ca&s;e, a few Per&s;ons could not be &s;uffici|ent to attend the whole who were willing to employ them.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>IT may here be objected, That this is but a pretended lowering of the Fees, and that Half a Crown a Vi&s;it lands in the &s;ame Thing as a Guinea now and then. But by what is &s;aid a|bove it appears, that tho' in &s;ome Ca&s;es, with Re&s;pect to the richer Sort, the Thing be really true, yet with Re&s;pect to the Generali|ty it is not &s;o, &s;ince very often one Vi&s;it or two may be &s;ufficient to give the Patient, or perhaps his Apothecary, &s;uch Directions as be|ing well ob&s;erved, will be of great U&s;e to him: And even the Rich will have this Advan|tage by it, that they will &s;ooner incline to call a Phy&s;ician to a &s;light Illne&s;s, than they do at pre&s;ent; and by &s;o doing, often prevent the en&s;uing of a very &s;evere One: For the fir&s;t Attacks of a Di&s;ea&s;e are many Times deceit|ful. Be&s;ides, this will be an Inducement to them to call &s;everals at a Time, where now One &s;erves; and &s;o they &s;hall have the joynt Advice of many at a very ea&s;y Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT was propo&s;ed in the fourth Place, <HI>viz. That the Chyrurgeon-Apothecaries would lo&s;e nothing,</HI> &s;eems liable to more Objections, becau&s;e the Scheme it &s;elf appears contriv'd with a De&s;ign to take the whole Practice of Me|dicine out of their Hands; whereas at pre&s;ent it is notourly known, that they are the Per|&s;ons who practi&s;e the mo&s;t of it in this Place;
<PB N="12" REF="11">and therefore, that if this Project &s;hould go on, it would in a Manner ruine their Bu&s;ine&s;s. But the thinking Part of the Gentlemen of that Incorporation (it might almo&s;t be a&s;&s;erted, the whole of them) are well &s;atisfied, that a quite contrary Effect would en&s;ue. For in the fir&s;t Place, the Affair of Surgery might be put un|der Regulations, as well as that of Medicine, with Re&s;pect to the Fees; and then, when e|ver an external Malady required Advice, or Attendance and Applications, either by the Surgeon or his Servants, a &s;tated Rule for his Payment would be found very convenient, both for the Surgeon and the Patient: Which may ea&s;ily be deduced from what was &s;aid above with Regard to Medicine, and what is clearly demon&s;trated by the con&s;tant Cu&s;tom in foreign Parts.</P>
<P>WITH Re&s;pect to Pharmacy, the Surgeon-Apothecaries, who at pre&s;ent, by the Laws of this Place, have the &s;ole Privilege of exerci|&s;ing that Art, &s;eldom make any Profit but by the &s;elling of their Medicines to their Patients; and if ever they are paid for Attendance, it is commonly by the more generous Sort, who even at pre&s;ent never fail to call a Phy&s;ician, as well as the Surgeon, to any internal Ca&s;e. As to the&s;e then, the new Propo&s;al makes no Odds; neither does it as to the others, &s;ince, whether they have a Phy&s;ician or not, the Account of
<PB N="13" REF="12">Medicines mu&s;t always be paid. Thus far as to the Negative Po&s;ition, That tho&s;e Gentle|men could not lo&s;e: Let us next ob&s;erve their Advantages. The mo&s;t of them are of &s;uch Candor, that they are often grieved when dealing with the poorer Sort, that the extra|vagant Fees of Phy&s;icians, entirely debar them from joyning other Advice to their own; and 'tis with Difficulty, that tho&s;e of middle Cir|cum&s;tances are per&s;waded to con&s;ent to it, e|ven where there is Danger. No doubt then, but &s;ince our Scheme opens a Door of having ea&s;ily the Concurrence of a Phy&s;ician to what|ever is done, the Surgeons mu&s;t have great Sa|tisfaction in it; for two Advices mu&s;t be as good as a &s;ingle one at lea&s;t, and the Character of DOCTOR will add &s;ome Honour to the Con|&s;ultation, and &s;o be more agreeable to the Pa|tient. Be&s;ides, the Per&s;on who furni&s;hes the Medicines, &s;eldom has the &s;ame Freedom of Mind to pre&s;cribe as another, le&s;t he be &s;u&s;|pected to have a View to his own Intere&s;t, and therefore he always wi&s;hes to have ano|ther to do it for him.</P>
<P>THAT the Character of DOCTOR adds little or nothing to the Matter, may be alledged, for this Rea&s;on, That the Surgeon-Apothecaries in this Place, are mo&s;tly Gentlemen, con&s;e|quently have the &s;ame Education with our Phy&s;icians, as to all the Parts of Learning
<PB N="14" REF="13">that are commonly taught in our younger Years; That afterwards, during their Appren|tice&s;hips, they have much Opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ick People, and &s;o, by Degrees, learn|ing how to Practi&s;e, by ob&s;erving what is done by others; That &s;ome of them, after the&s;e Advantages, have been bred in the mo&s;t famous medical Schools; Others again have, for a long Tract of Time, had a mo&s;t nume|rous Practice in the Army or Navy, and by this Means, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have their Know|ledge enriched with many valuable Ob&s;erva|tions of their own, which never fail to im|prove one better than what is learned by Hear|&s;ay; That in this Place they are not admit|ted to Practi&s;e, but after having gone through a very &s;trict and &s;evere Examination, upon all Parts of Anatomy, Surgery, and Pharmacy, (which include a va&s;t Part of Medicine) and which they are obliged to undergo, in about &s;even different Diets, by their pre&s;ent Rules. This &s;eems, as indeed it is, to be as Augu&s;t a medical Trial as any in the World, altho' confin'd to &s;ome particular Parts of the Sci|ence; and they are not admitted to this Tri|al, 'till after Eight Years from the Beginning of their Apprentice&s;hip; in which Time it is to be pre&s;umed, that they are pretty well qua|lify'd, when we know that there are &s;ome Graduations, after a very few Months Study,
<PB N="15" REF="14">and perhaps without any at all. 'Tis true, there are &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, who have a Right to be admitted to Trial with the Sur|geons &s;ooner than at the End of Eight Years: But as that re&s;pects not the Generality, it is not worth noticing; and the Abridgments that are made of this Time are commonly very &s;mall. By all this then it would appear, That the Surgeon &s;eems to bid fairer for be|ing a good Practitioner than the Doctor, and wants only the <HI>Diploma.</HI></P>
<P>WITH the greate&s;t Regard imaginable to the Gentlemen of the honourable Profe&s;&s;ion of Surgery, the mo&s;t ancient, and &s;till the mo&s;t certain Part of Medicine, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, That the Facts above reci|ted are true; but yet it mu&s;t be allowed, That the learned Faculty of Medicine will &s;till keep its Dignity, if the Ca&s;e be fairly con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>A Phy&s;ician, who ju&s;tly merits and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es the Rank and Title of DOCTOR, is not one who comes in&s;tructed with a few Scrapes of Knowledge, taken from his own Ob&s;ervation; but brings with him, before he offers to Pra|cti&s;e, the learned and laboriou&s;ly acquir'd Trea&s;ures of va&s;t Numbers of Ages. The Life of one Man is extremely &s;hort, and is therefore, without great A&s;&s;i&s;tance, uncapa|ble of making any con&s;iderable Improve|ments
<PB N="16" REF="15">in &s;o noble, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es intricate, a Science as that of Medicine. There is then no po&s;&s;ible Means of attaining to any Degree of Perfection in it, but by reviewing the Mo|numents of Antiquity, which, by a particular Providence of Heaven, have been pre&s;erved to us. There we are in&s;tructed by Multi|tudes of Ob&s;ervations exactly taken, through a great Tract of Years, in all the Changes that appear, as the Humane Body from Health degenerates into a State of Sickne&s;s; as it again, by the Means of Nature, returns to its former healthful Condition; or per|haps continues infected by &s;ome Remains of the Di&s;ea&s;e; or, being overcome with the Load of the Di&s;temper, peri&s;hes. We are well advertis'd of all the &s;en&s;ible Cau&s;es, that have been ob&s;erv'd to precede and produce tho&s;e Di&s;tempers, and of all the Methods that the Wit of Man has been able to di&s;co|ver, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting Nature to overcome them; and how tho&s;e Methods have &s;ucceeded now for many Thou&s;ands of Years. It is no &s;mall Task to become well acquainted with the Ob&s;ervations and Doctrine of the Illu&s;trious Ancients; and no &s;mall Plea&s;ure, to find them daily verify'd in our own Practice. If we add to tho&s;e, what the Indu&s;try of later Times has furni&s;h'd to us, with re&s;pect to &s;ome new Di&s;ea&s;es, we may be allowed to be
<PB N="17" REF="16">well qualify'd in our Profe&s;&s;ion: But yet more &s;o, if we call the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Philo&s;ophy to our Aid, under due Re&s;trictions, that is, ne|ver &s;uffering our Rea&s;onings to lead us a|way from what is undoubtedly true in Fact. If after an exact Scrutiny into all the Parts of the Animal Machine, we be able to demon|&s;trate the U&s;es of all that various Structure, and nice Complication of Organs in every different Part of it, and to explain the Springs of all their Actions, we cannot be at a Lo&s;s, when its Functions are put out of Order by Sickne&s;s, to under&s;tand where the Fault lies.</P>
<P>IF then we go further, and examin the Pro|perties of all the Material World, to di&s;cover what Parts of it may be of Service in our Art; If we &s;urvey the beauteous vegetable Creation, and draw what Aid we can from the healthful Qualities of Plants; If we dive into the Rece&s;&s;es of the Earth, and extort A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Mineral Kingdom; Then explore the Seas, Earth, and Air, for all the various Animals that have any Parts that can be u&s;eful to pre&s;erve or repair the Body of Man: If all tho&s;e different Objects are care|fully con&s;idered, and their Properties enquired into, and all done with due Regard to the &s;tanding practical Ob&s;ervations above mentio|ned, undoubtedly we mu&s;t draw &s;uch Helps from Philo&s;ophy, as very much mu&s;t improve
<PB N="18" REF="17">our Art: And we will think it but a &s;mall Exaggeration in the Founder of it, who was a Heathen, when he affirms, <HI>That a Phy&s;i|cian who is a Philo&s;opher is equal to a God.</HI> With &s;uch a Phy&s;ician, if any &s;uch there be, no Surgeon or Apothecary but will think it his Happine&s;s to be engaged about a Patient: For tho' he him&s;elf, as above, may have &s;een a great deal of Practice, and under&s;tand &s;eve|ral Branches of the Art; yet the many Inter|ruptions to Study that commonly an Appren|tice&s;hip brings along with it, and the over &s;oon going to Practi&s;e at one's own Hand, will certainly make him unacquainted with many Things which a learned Phy&s;ician knows, and has gathered from the Writings of Antiquity, whence the mo&s;t of his Know|ledge comes. For really the Practice of any true Phy&s;ician, does not &s;o much furni&s;h him with new Ob&s;ervations, as it gives him a Fa|cility in repeating the old Ones, and applying them to particular Ca&s;es: So that Study and Practice both concur to make a complete Ar|ti&s;t. But it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that much Stu|dy, with a moderate Share of Practice, makes a far greater Phy&s;ician, than little or no Stu|dy, tho' with va&s;t Practice: For, as above, he relies not on his own Ob&s;ervation, but on that of a great many Ages. To return to our Point, the Character of <HI>Doctor</HI> mu&s;t add to
<PB N="19" REF="18">the Satisfaction both of the Patient and Apo|thecary in every Ca&s;e, if he be what he ought to be, and can recommend him&s;elf by his Dex|terity, both in foretelling what is to happen in Di&s;ea&s;es, and by curing them if they are not de&s;perate; which will di&s;tingui&s;h him from all Impo&s;tures, better than his Degree in the Univer&s;ity, the Honour of which is often ba&s;ely pro&s;tituted. The Wi&s;dom of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has erected Colleges in the different Metropolis's of the Three Kingdoms, to be a Check upon all Foreign Degrees. And it were to be wi&s;hed, that our own Univer&s;ities would take Care to admit none, but who are well qua|lified, which would make every Doctor an Honour to the Faculty. And if at the &s;ame Time the Fees were &s;uch as is propo&s;ed in this Paper, the Practice would &s;oon entirely come into their Hands, to the great Benefit of all, and the Lo&s;s of no Body, not even of the Surgeons, as has been proved. Now it may be further ad|ded, as a Rea&s;on why a Phy&s;ician ought always to be con&s;ulted about any &s;ick Per&s;on, that as we are not here in a Place where, by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws, any Per&s;on indifferently is allowed to exerci&s;e what Branches of the medical Art he &s;hall think fit; &s;o it is a Sort of U&s;urpation of other People's Rights, and a flying in the Face of Authority, for any one, not legally intitled, to pre&s;cribe Medicines. And grant that
<PB N="20" REF="19">&s;ome who are not graduated, may have more Knowledge than others who are; yet as the Publick knows no other Te&s;t of one's Quali|fications, but the having a regular Degree, which in this City mu&s;t be examined and ac|knowledged by the Royal College; and as the taking away the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Te&s;timo|ny, would have very bad Con&s;equences, by be|ing an Inlet to the very vile&s;t and mo&s;t igno|rant of the People to practi&s;e without being que&s;tioned; &s;o 'tis hoped that no Per&s;on, how|ever well accompli&s;hed, if he be not a <HI>Doctor,</HI> will take it ami&s;s to be told, that the ju&s;t Right to give Medicines belongs to others. Let him, if he plea&s;es, take his Degrees and &s;ati&s;|fy the College, or el&s;e keep within his own Sphere, as the Phy&s;icians ought to do with|in theirs, neither performing Chirurgical Operations, nor furni&s;hing Medicines to any one, unle&s;s they have the Privilege of &s;o do|ing from the Board of Surgeon-Apotheca|ries. Neither need they pretend any Ad|vantage in their doing the la&s;t, on Account that they are &s;ure&s;t of their own Medicines, &s;ince the Faithfulne&s;s of the Chirurgeon-Apothecaries of this City, in that Particu|lar, is well known. The Profe&s;&s;ions of Me|dicine and Surgery are much a Kin; to the one belongs the Cure of Internal, to the other the Cure of External Maladies: The Profe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="21" REF="20">of them are then in that Re&s;pect Brethren, and on an equal Lay. If any Man will exerci&s;e both, let him take the nece&s;&s;ary Powers from both Societies. There is no Incon&s;i&s;tency, no Di&s;honour in it, that they know who have &s;tudied the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions, (what|ever the more Ignorant may object) for the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters were &s;uch as exerci&s;ed both. But let no Apothecary pretend to pre&s;cribe; his Bu&s;ine&s;s is only to obey Pre&s;criptions: Let no Surgeon do the &s;ame, if it is not in External Ca&s;es, which naturally come within his Pro|vince. Let no Phy&s;ician perform an Operation, make External Applications, or compound and furni&s;h Medicines, unle&s;s &s;uch a Per&s;on be ve|&s;ted with the Powers of both Societies. This would evite all Confu&s;ion, and keep every one's Privileges di&s;tinct; and all Pretences for con|founding of them will be taken away, if every Sick Per&s;on may have the Advice of a Phy|&s;ician at an ea&s;ie Rate. For we know that the Exorbitancy of the Fees was always given as a Rea&s;on why the Surgeons were under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to pre&s;cribe; but that it would be much better for them were it otherwi&s;e, 'tis hoped is is now made clear.</P>
<P>THE Fifth Propo&s;ition it is needle&s;s now to in&s;i&s;t on, for the Advantages to the Country mu&s;t be very great, if the poorer, as well as
<PB N="22" REF="21">richer Inhabitants of it be all equally admitted to reap the Benefit of &s;o valuable an Art as Medicine. By this Means the Populace, by getting free Acce&s;s to regular Phy&s;icians, will have no longer their Bodies left at the Mercy of every ignorant Pretender to Phy&s;ick, or be glad to apply for Advice to every impertinent Quack, becau&s;e his Fees are &s;uch as they are able to afford; to which Sort of Gentlemen, we &s;ee they con&s;tantly flock wherever they offer, and of which there has been a notable In&s;tance lately in this very Place. It can be prov'd, that neither Pe&s;tilence, Famine, or War, ever have committed &s;uch Ravages to the De&s;tru|ction of Human Kind, as the unskilful Appli|cation of Medicine has. If &s;uch wrong Ap|plications then, of a noble and u&s;eful Art, can be in a great Mea&s;ure prevented by our Scheme, were it not an egregious Cruelty to the World, in the lea&s;t to oppo&s;e its taking Effect, e&s;peci|ally con&s;idering, that no one Per&s;on can po&s;&s;i|bly lo&s;e any Thing by it, as has been &s;uffici|ently demon&s;trated?</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid upon this Sub|ject, it may appear &s;omewhat &s;trange, that &s;uch an important Affair has been &s;o long ne|glected: And as it appears to be &s;omething of Moment, &s;o it were to be wi&s;hed, that a pro|per Method of actually putting it in Executi|on,
<PB N="23" REF="22">were fallen upon; becau&s;e the be&s;t and mo&s;t profitable De&s;igns often prove abortive, on Account of the bad Management of the Undertakers.</P>
<P>No doubt, &s;ince there is a College of Phy|&s;icians, here, erected by Royal Authority, for the Improvement of Medicine, it is their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s to further this <HI>Propo&s;al;</HI> and it were well if they did &s;o. But as Societies &s;eldom do much in the like Matters, on Ac|count that their Members are &s;eldom all a|greed in any one Point; and as this Project has been before them a long Time ago, and much pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t Noted in the Society; and as at that Time it met with Di&s;couragement, (certainly, as appears by what is here advanced, without any good Rea&s;on) &s;o in all Probability it wou'd do the &s;ame again; and therefore &s;ome &s;ingle Per&s;on, or a few, mu&s;t &s;et about it, otherwi&s;e &s;o good a De&s;ign mu&s;t for ever peri&s;h. It is indeed a bold Undertaking for any one Man, but what inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity &s;eems to throw upon &s;ome Body. It may here perhaps be asked, Does any Man in this Place, e&s;pecially if he is not a very old One, think him&s;elf qualified as a Phy&s;ician ought to be, according to the De|&s;cription given of a <HI>True Phy&s;ician</HI> above, and that therefore he can be the Per&s;on to undertake this Work? This may be an&s;wered
<PB N="24" REF="23">by asking another Que&s;tion; Pray, does any young Man think him&s;elf qualified for pre|&s;cribing to Patients, in Quality of <HI>Doctor,</HI> where the Life of his Neighbour is &s;o nearly concerned? Really any Per&s;on that is &s;uffici|ent for the one, may be &s;ufficient for doing the other, and can be capable of neither, without a great deal of the Study above &s;poken of, and Practice for &s;ome Time. And indeed any Man can as ea&s;ily know, whether he him|&s;elf has made con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in the Do|ctrine of <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> as another can whe|ther he again under&s;tands <HI>Euclid.</HI> And it is pre&s;umed, that no Man of common Sen&s;e will be refu&s;ed an Allowance to pa&s;s a Judgment upon him&s;elf, whether he under&s;tands the la&s;t mentioned <HI>Author</HI> or not.</P>
<P>IF this then is &s;o, &s;ome Per&s;on or other may, without incurring the Imputation of ex|traordinary Vanity, take the Burden of this whole Affair upon him, and &s;et up with as good a Grace for being ready to &s;erve a great many at a cheap Rate, as any other Man can to &s;erve a few at a dear one. And no doubt, but that if this Method were once followed with any tolerable Succe&s;s, by any Per&s;on, the Royal College would by Degrees come into it, however unwilling they may be at the Beginning; and &s;o at length the Country reap the whole Benefit propo&s;ed by it.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
<P>THERE is one Advantage not yet taken Notice of, which is, That if &s;ome certain Per|&s;ons were the Undertakers, the young Stu|dents of Medicine might reap a great deal of Good by it.</P>
<P>THERE has of late been taught here, and with &s;ome con&s;iderable Succe&s;s, at the <HI>Surge|ons Hall,</HI> the whole Art of Medicine, in a Sy&s;tematical Way; in which Cour&s;e, with all imaginable Care of the Performers, nothing has been omitted which to them &s;eem'd ne|ce&s;&s;ary, either to demon&s;trate the Theory, or illu&s;trate and explain regular Practice, as drawn from certain Experience and un|que&s;tionably ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations. This they have done, with all due Regard to the great Names of tho&s;e who have furni&s;hed the World with a va&s;t Trea&s;ure of practical Ob&s;ervati|ons, and of tho&s;e who&s;e great Indu&s;try and accurate Genius's, have confirmed and impro|ved the Theory by many valuable Di&s;cove|ries; and with no le&s;s Deference to the Great Per&s;on who, from va&s;t Volumes, has collected all relating to the one or the other, into &s;uch an exact Order, and into &s;uch Bounds, that what concerns either of them can be ex|plained in the Cour&s;e of a Seven or Eight Months College; which Task they own them|&s;elves unable to have performed, without the Aid of &s;o great a Ma&s;ter.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>THEY hope that they are of Service in &s;everal Re&s;pects to their Country. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Money which it was formerly nece&s;&s;ary for Phy&s;icians to be&s;tow on a foreign Education, may be kept at home. <HI>Next,</HI> A great many who had not Ability to go abroad to pur|cha&s;e Learning, are now taught in their own Country, which puts them to a &s;mall Ex|pence; and by this Means a great many ac|quire a ju&s;t Notion of a regular Practice, who otherwi&s;e would perhaps never have heard of it; and yet, may be, would have play'd the <HI>Doctor</HI> with as great A&s;&s;urance as they &s;hall do now; but under what Di&s;advantages it is ea&s;y to tell. Be&s;ides, the extraordinary Pains that tho&s;e Gentlemen have been at, in teaching in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as well as in <HI>Latin,</HI> and in in&s;i&s;ting &s;o minutely on every Particular, as to be un|der&s;tood by tho&s;e of any Capacity, will have this good Effect, that many who perhaps wanted the previous nece&s;&s;ary Learning fit to accompli&s;h one for &s;tudying Phy&s;ick, altho' they cannot po&s;&s;ibly reap the &s;ame Benefit from the Cour&s;e, as others well educated will; yet they will always carry away a great deal, and &s;o be much better fitted than they could have been without it, to &s;erve either in the Army, or the Navy, where Medicine, as often as Surgery, is their Bu&s;ine&s;s; altho' a &s;ufficient Knowledge of the la&s;t is ab&s;olutely
<PB N="27" REF="26">nece&s;&s;ary for them, and the Whole of it, to wit of Surgery, is fully explain'd as Part of the Cour&s;e. The hearing of it then, will make any of them, at lea&s;t, much &s;ooner good Sur|geons, than they can be without it. And as <HI>Edinburgh</HI> furni&s;hes a great many Surgeons to all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, it is with Plea|&s;ure that the&s;e Gentlemen believe, if they meet with &s;uitable Encouragement, they &s;hall &s;ave many a Subject to the Nation.</P>
<P>TO return, after this Digre&s;&s;ion, to our Point: If tho&s;e Gentlemen, or any of them, would undertake to give Advice, at the Rate of Half a Crown a Vi&s;it to any Patient with|in the Ports of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or the <HI>Canongate;</HI> and for a Shilling to every Per&s;on, who at certain Hours &s;hould con&s;ult them at Home; and <HI>Gratis</HI> to every extremely indigent Per&s;on who &s;hould come to them: By this Means the Students could &s;ee a great Deal of Practice, and have the Plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving, that what was taught them in the College, was before their Eyes verify'd in Fact. Their Ma&s;ter might take one or more of them, at a Time, to &s;uch Pa|tients as he &s;hould think proper; but e&s;pecial|ly, he could make them Witne&s;&s;es of his Pra|ctice at Home, which 'tis believ'd (all will a|gree) would be a great Advantage to them; and therefore it is Needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on it. But what is their Advantage, comes in Time to
<PB N="28" REF="27">be the Advantage of the Publick. Now if any of the Per&s;ons ju&s;t mention'd, do under|take what we propo&s;e, 'tis hoped, That their daily Imployment of Teaching, puts them a|bove the Su&s;picion of being very ignorant; and therefore the good Work may &s;ucceed in their Hands, as well as in that of any One who&s;oever. And then the two Ob&s;tacles that were propo&s;ed in the Beginning, as the Hin|drances of the Advantages ari&s;ing from the medical Art, that is, The Ignorance of &s;ome Practi&s;ers, and the Difficulty of con&s;ulting the Be&s;t on Account of their Fees, will both be al|mo&s;t wholly removed, when the whole Science is to be learned in our own Country, and there|fore every Man made inexcu&s;able who learns it not, and yet de&s;igns to practi&s;e it; and then tho&s;e who have learned it, to be advi&s;ed with at &s;uch a Rate as every Patient can afford.</P>
<P>Is it then Fact, That the Method of pra|cti&s;ing Medicine at pre&s;ent, is &s;ubject to ma|ny Inconveniencies, which affect mo&s;t Part of the Faculty, and the whole Lieges in gene|ral, except a very few? By the whole Tenor of the Premi&s;&s;es is it demon&s;trated, That what is here propo&s;ed would be an effectual Reme|dy, whereby they might all be remov'd? Is the only Way left to bring &s;uch a Remedy a|bout, pointed out; that is, That it mu&s;t be attempted by a &s;ingle Per&s;on, or by a few?
<PB N="29" REF="28">And are there &s;uch Per&s;ons, who think they have a Probability of &s;ucceeding in it? Are all the&s;e Things &s;o, and nothing to &s;tand in the Way of &s;o good a De&s;ign, but the Malice or Envy of &s;ome People of little Souls, and mean Capacities? THEN let the Thing be in|&s;tantly gone about. It is rea&s;onable in it &s;elf, and the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of our Coun|try, where there is &s;uch an extreme Scarcity of Money, nece&s;&s;arily require it, were there nothing el&s;e in the Matter. The more Dirt the Ignorant or Malicious endeavour to throw upon the Undertaker of a good Work, the more Honour to him, who can contemn Things of &s;o much In&s;ignificancy, and go on to do well; and the more Ignominy and Di&s;|grace to his Oppo&s;ers, in the Eyes of all the knowing and candid World. The Author of this Paper is very well appri&s;ed of the com|mon Methods of running down any Thing, however ju&s;t, if a Per&s;on &s;hall plea&s;e, who&s;e Talent lies that Way. He, and every Body el&s;e, is aware of the Backbiting Tittle-tat|tle, the impertinent Sneer to in&s;inuate a Slan|der, and all the little jirking villanous Arts of Detraction and Defamation, and of the wrong Con&s;tructions that may be put upon every Thing. He owns frankly, That if any of this Sort of Artillery be brought again&s;t him, he heartily de&s;pi&s;es it. If any rea&s;ona|ble
<PB N="30" REF="29">Argument be brought again&s;t what is pro|po&s;ed, he is willing to hear it; and if it be a good one, to be convinced by it.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time he thinks, after what is &s;aid, it is proper to let the Publick know, That there is a De&s;ign, by &s;ome of the Faculty of Medicine, as well in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as in &s;ome of the other Royal Burghs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> actually to Practi&s;e in the propo|&s;ed Way, (that is, for a &s;mall Fee each Con&s;ultation) and it is hoped, That &s;o lau|dable an Undertaking will meet with all due Encouragement. The Particulars of the Per|&s;ons Names, and the Fees they are to take, will afterwards be declared. All others are heartily invited to come into the &s;ame Way of doing, making &s;uch Alterations in their Method of following out the Scheme, as &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit their Conveniency, and the Circum|&s;tances of the Place they live in.</P>
<P>THIS &s;mall ESSAY is humbly &s;ubmit|ted to the Judgment of the candid World; and the Author is per&s;waded, That whether his Propo&s;al &s;ucceed at pre&s;ent, or not, that there are &s;ome Con&s;iderations which &s;eem plain|ly to evince, That &s;ooner or later it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily take in this Country; and then it will be &s;ufficient Honour for him, to have been the fir&s;t Mover in &s;uch an important Affair.</P>
