<P>THE very &s;light per&s;onal knowledge which I have of your Lord&s;hip could not have ju&s;tified me in the liberty I take in prefixing to this mo&s;t humble little work your Lord&s;hip's name, had I not been well informed, by gentlemen of the highe&s;t integrity and honour,
<PB N="vi" REF="3">who are perfectly acquainted with your Lord&s;hip, of your uncommon philan|thropy and goodne&s;s of heart&mdash;General report, my Lord, has indeed &s;aid &s;uf|ficient in your prai&s;e to entitle you to the world's approbation &mdash; But when the&s;e were &s;igned, &s;ealed, and delivered to me, by the very re&s;pectable charac|ters before mentioned, it became a mo&s;t complete ratification of your ine&s;tima|ble worth.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE title of this pamphlet required that it &s;hould be written in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple language, which I have endeavoured to do by avoiding as much as po&s;&s;ible all technical words, a few excepted, (and tho&s;e by no means e&s;&s;ential to many whether they under&s;tand them or not, as they cannot be embarra&s;&s;ed for want of knowing them in the u&s;e of the pills, the directions for which are clear and intelligible to the lowe&s;t capacity) but what may be found in an Engli&s;h dictionary, to which &s;uch as read can have recour&s;e, and they who are &s;o unfortunate as not to be able will re|ceive information from tho&s;e that can, which I am certain every truly generous mind will be happy to give them. For the preceding rea&s;ons the Author tru&s;ts that &s;uch recapitulations as the judicious
<PB N="2" REF="7">reader meets with in the cour&s;e of this work will be excu&s;ed, his wi&s;h being to render every thing re&s;pecting the medicine it treats of, &amp;c., as plain and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible to the common reader.</P>
<P>The Antibilious Alterative Pills is a mo&s;t in|comparable remedy for all indi&s;po&s;itions of the &s;tomach and bowels ari&s;ing <HI>from bile,</HI> foulne&s;s, in|dige&s;tion, worms, acidity, ardor ventriculi, (or heartburn, &s;o called) predige&s;tion, <HI>flatulency, (that many headed mon&s;ter),</HI> co&s;tivene&s;s, &amp;c., &amp;c., which la&s;t often produces &s;everal of the foregoing, as well as many other, complaints, <HI>owing to the feces or excrement becoming highly putrid from too long retention in the body,</HI> thereby forming a nidus, or ne&s;t of predi&s;po&s;ing putrefaction, which meeting with ma|lignant exhalations in the air, or tho&s;e ari&s;ing from infected per&s;ons or places, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., the mo&s;t dreadful fevers, agues, inflammatory di&s;orders of various kinds, &s;curvy, ery&s;ipelas or St. Anthony's fire, rheumati&s;m, lepro&s;y, jaundice, cruptive com|plaints, and numberle&s;s others, are occa&s;ioned: hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of paying the mo&s;t reli|gious attention to the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of the body, which the able and judicious phy&s;ician never fails to make the fir&s;t object of his con&s;ideration. The <HI>&s;tomach</HI> is the grand re&s;ervoir which receives and prepares whatever is to &s;upport and nouri&s;h the whole machine, con&s;equently if <HI>that</HI> is out of re|pair, or di&s;ea&s;ed from any of the before-mentioned cau&s;es, or others, whatever is taken into &s;uch a
<PB N="3" REF="8">&s;tomach mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly fail, more or le&s;s, of pro|ducing the natural and intended effect, and, in&s;tead of properly nouri&s;hing the body, &s;ends periodically into the circulation&mdash;<HI>&s;ince blood is made from what we eat and drink</HI>&mdash;a portion of di&s;ea&s;ed matter, which, congregating by degrees, mu&s;t inevitably occa&s;ion various di&s;orders in the &s;y&s;tem; and although the efforts of nature to relieve her&s;elf from the variety of attacks made upon her are often great and won|derful, (and always &s;hould be attended to) yet without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, &s;ea&s;onably and pro|perly admini&s;tered, &s;he frequently finks under the burden. The &s;ame All-good Being that provided remedies for the brute part of the creation, made them al&s;o for man; the former are directed by in|&s;tinct to theirs, the latter &s;hould have recour&s;e to rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Pills, then, which, in con&s;cious rectitude, I now venture to offer to the Public, are the atten|tive re&s;ult of thirty years exten&s;ive practice in va|rious parts of the world, (upwards of twenty of which I pa&s;&s;ed in His Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, in the army); the officers and &s;oldiers of which, (to whom I have the honour to be known) and whom I beg leave, in this humble, little pamphlet, to invoke, will, I doubt not, do me the ju&s;tice to &s;peak as, I pre&s;ume to think, my conduct and character merit, that of being indefatigable, attentive, and candid, in my profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ucce&s;sful in my practice: I have the &s;ame expectations from tho&s;e among&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="9">whom I have now practi&s;ed above ten years in this capital.</P>
<P>I am, however, well aware that this addre&s;s (and the object of it) is likely to &s;ubject me to the &s;ar|ca&s;tical &s;neers of &s;ome of the wonderful geniu&s;es of the faculty, many of whom owe, however, perhaps their mo&s;t exalted fame to the <HI>&s;ecret u&s;e</HI> of Dr. James's powder, and other medicines of that de|&s;cription. There are be&s;ides, I make no doubt, &s;ome other thru&s;ts I mu&s;t be prepared to parry from tho&s;e uninformed, contracted minds, who term every medicine, the con&s;tituent parts of which the proprietor <HI>keeps in &s;ecret,</HI> a quack medicine, and re|fu&s;e to take it on that account; at the &s;ame time &s;wallow abundantly the pre&s;criptions of the apothe|cary and phy&s;ician, of which they have ju&s;t as much knowledge as of the ingredients that compo&s;e my pills. But to &s;uch I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that they are totally ignorant of the true meaning of the word <HI>quack,</HI> that epithet being only applicable to illite|rate pretenders, not properly bred to the profe&s;&s;ion, and unacquainted with its practice; otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow that every man, of whatever art, &s;cience, or profe&s;&s;ion, who improves an old, or in|vents any new thing, becau&s;e he will not divulge the <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> becomes indi&s;putably a quack; con&s;e|quently there mu&s;t be quack lawyers and preachers, who profit well by keeping mankind in <HI>&s;ecret dark|ne&s;s;</HI> quack painters, coblers, tinkers, and taylors; and it may not be unfair to add, quack phy&s;icians of
<PB N="5" REF="10">State, who, notwith&s;tanding their feeling regard for His Maje&s;ty's loyal &s;ubjects, will not blu&s;h to crib a &s;hilling's worth of pills out of <HI>The poor Man's Me|dicine Che&s;t (&s;tamp duty)</HI> to admini&s;ter to the hectic con&s;titution of the State, and relieve the canine ap|petite of minions, placemen and pen&s;ioners. Here &s;top for a moment, Humanity! and reflect upon what the &s;en&s;ations of that man's heart mu&s;t be who fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted this benevolent tax, <HI>extorted from the painful afflictions and mi&s;eries of the &s;ick,</HI> particularly the lower orders of &s;ociety, who are frequently obliged to &s;eek relief from what are termed quack medicines, after perhaps having &s;pent nearly their little all in vain endeavours to obtain it from the mo&s;t eminent gentlemen of the faculty.&mdash;A no&s;trum they may term my medicine, if they plea&s;e, for &s;uch it is, (and of which mo&s;t of the faculty have to boa&s;t a few); but which I &s;hall be ready to make known to the Public <HI>for a proper gratuity,</HI> whenever it &s;hall be found to an&s;wer, as I am confident it will do, to all &s;uch as give it a fair and impartial trial.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to take up &s;o much of the reader's time as I have done in this addre&s;s, or have appeared &s;o much my own panegyri&s;t, as mo&s;t probably I &s;hall be thought, but with a view to re|move as much as po&s;&s;ible the prejudices which ge|nerally (and &s;ometimes ju&s;tly) attend on addre&s;&s;es of this &s;ort, particularly when un&s;anctioned by a voluminous publication entered at Stationers' Hall &mdash;a mode quite in fa&s;hion with modern practitioners,
<PB N="6" REF="11">who begin their career that way to attract public notice; in works of which de&s;cription the pre&s;s al|ready teems with too many in the medical line, the mere offspring of lectures, and &s;tuffed with the wri|ter's own and borrowed hypothe&s;es, une&s;tabli&s;hed and inadmi&s;&s;ible in practice, &s;erving only to bewilder and lead the Public into fatal errors.</P>
<P>Hippocrates &s;ays the de&s;cription of the cau&s;es and treatment of di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould not be the &s;uppo&s;itions of ingenious men, (for all hypothe&s;es, &s;ays that learned father of the faculty, I reject as u&s;ele&s;s, nay dangerous, in phy&s;ic) but from certain means often tried on human bodies, the effects of which bear evident proof to our &s;en&s;es, all our rea&s;onings &s;hould be drawn; not but I ever wi&s;h to &s;ee in print the well-dige&s;ted &s;entiments of able and experienced men of the profe&s;&s;ion: it is their duty to give them, and the world are indebted to them for &s;uch&mdash;&s;uch as will &s;tand the te&s;t and command the &s;anction of the critical reviewer without fear, partiality, or bribe.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, in my private opinion, the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic is by no means &s;o difficult, or involved in &s;uch labyrinths, as many writers would make the world believe. A proper knowledge of the human &s;y&s;tem, with &s;trict attention to the efforts and ope|rations of <HI>nature,</HI> joined to a quick perceptibility on the part of the practitioner to watch and catch the critical period when <HI>&s;he</HI> can't relieve her&s;elf, and
<PB N="7" REF="12">then to a&s;&s;i&s;t her <HI>cautiou&s;ly</HI> by the proper and expe|rienced u&s;e of &s;uch aid as Providence has provided for that purpo&s;e, is the only ta&s;k of a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Having now &s;aid as much as I think is nece&s;&s;ary to offer (in this place) to a di&s;cerning Public in be|half of my Box of Pills, &amp;c., I &s;hall proceed to give as clear and conci&s;e directions as po&s;&s;ible for their u&s;e in the complaints already mentioned, and &s;ome others, making &s;ome farther remarks as I go along.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>DIRECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>For a grown per&s;on, <HI>a common do&s;e of the&s;e pills is three,</HI> one to be taken going to bed, and two the next morning. Strong con&s;titutions may take two night and morning, and &s;ome have taken three night and morning; but in general one at night and two in the morning is &s;ufficient, and many require only one night and morning.</P>
<P>A child of one year old may take a third part of one of the pills; from three years to five, half a pill, and from five to ten a whole pill; and &s;o on in proportion to age and &s;trength. As it may be diffi|cult to make children &s;wallow a pill, it may be di&s;|&s;olved in any &s;imple liquid, or mixed with a little pap or currant jelly.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="13">
<P>My rea&s;on for preferring part of the do&s;e to be taken over night is, that, by gradually di&s;&s;olving whil&s;t the body is at re&s;t, it mixes more readily with the offending matter in the &s;tomach, &amp;c., thereby exciting it into action, renders the remain|ing part of the do&s;e more effectual and &s;peedy in its operation in the morning.</P>
<P>As the&s;e pills are a declared enemy to <HI>bile,</HI> when|ever that is in the &s;tomach they never fail to vomit, and &s;ometimes one pill in the cour&s;e of the night will operate both ways; not owing to the violence or &s;trength of the medicine, as &s;ome may be in|duced to think, but from the great &s;oulne&s;s and plenitude of the &s;tomach and bowels at the time be|ing overloaded with bilious filth or too-long-retained feces &mdash; a &s;elf-evident po&s;ition which mu&s;t appear clear to every intelligent capacity &mdash; therefore &s;hould the night pill only operate by vomit, the patient mu&s;t not be deterred from taking more in the morn|ing; for after the &s;tomach has been well clean&s;ed of its contents, two or three more pills will only occa|&s;ion as many &s;tools without any farther &s;ickne&s;s. If after the fir&s;t do&s;e any part of the cau&s;e which in|duced taking them &s;hould appear to remain, they may be taken daily, or every other day, until all the offending matter is carried off.</P>
<P>During their operation it will be proper to drink a draught of gruel, beef or chamomile tea, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;imple liquid, to &s;acilitate each operation, and
<PB N="9" REF="14">render it more effectual, which the patient will do well to have in readine&s;s previous to taking the pills.</P>
<P>This efficacious medicine, though &s;ometimes &s;o bri&s;k in operating, is notwith&s;tanding, I do aver, as innocent and as &s;afe as a do&s;e of &s;alts, rhubarb, or a common emetic, and may be taken at all times and &s;ea&s;ons with as little ri&s;k or danger, as they will always find their way out of the body by vomit, &s;tool, or urine, and quietly by the latter, unle&s;s when they meet with &s;uch humours in their pa&s;&s;age as required being carried off by the other outlets.</P>
<P>The advantages, then, ari&s;ing from the&s;e pills, according to this unvarni&s;hed account, mu&s;t be many, and great.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, By effectually clean&s;ing the <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> that grand re&s;ervoir is put in a proper &s;tate to perform the important offices, for which nature intended it, of dige&s;tion, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, By removing all long-retained feces, and bilious, &s;limy matter from the lower bowels, fevers, jaundice, agues, cholic, worms, <HI>flatulency,</HI> in&s;lammatory tendency, rhcumati&s;m, &amp;c., &amp;c., are cut off in the bud and de&s;troyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, In filtering by the kidnies and urinary pa&s;&s;ages, gravelly concretions, drop&s;y, &amp;c., are hap|pily
<PB N="10" REF="15">relieved and prevented; and la&s;tly, by con|veying <HI>accumulated &s;alts</HI> and other acrid and feculant humours out of the blood by this channel, lepro&s;y, &s;curvy, &s;crophulous humours, and many eruptive complaints, and other foulne&s;&s;es of the blood <HI>ari&s;ing from thence,</HI> as well as all that tribe of complaints termed nervous, originating from the &s;ame &s;ource, (&s;ince the nerves as well as the re&s;t of the body re|ceive their nouri&s;hment from the blood) are pre|vented, and often cured.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Hence it will appear that the&s;e pills are not only an effectual clean&s;er of the &s;tomach and bowels, but al&s;o a mo&s;t POWERFUL ALTERATIVE.</P>
<P>To which end, after having properly prepared the body by two or three <HI>common do&s;es,</HI> taken in the &s;pace of a week or ten days, the patient &s;hould then enter on the alterative cour&s;e, fir&s;t by taking one pill at night for four or five nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, after|wards take one night and morning; continuing the&s;e as long as any part of the cau&s;e or effect which induced taking them appears to remain; and it will not be ami&s;s to continue them &s;ome little time longer, (for it &s;ometimes happens that cau&s;es re|main after effects vani&s;h; and frequently it happens, as, for in&s;tance, in the &s;mall pox, that effects, &s;uch as a redne&s;s of the &s;kin, &amp;c., remain for &s;ome time after the cau&s;e is removed) ob&s;erving to in|crea&s;e the night or morning do&s;e occa&s;ionally to keep the body gently open. It having been already re|marked,
<PB N="11" REF="16">that after the &s;tomach has been well clean&s;ed they cea&s;e to act as an emetic; for as the bodies of &s;ome are con&s;titutionally co&s;tive, it may become nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch habits to increa&s;e the do&s;e as ju&s;t mentioned, yet, in general, a pill night and morn|ing not only relieves the mo&s;t co&s;tive habits, but one will prove &s;ufficient in mo&s;t con&s;titutions for that purpo&s;e. Here it may not be improper to remark, that co&s;tive habits are more &s;ubject than others to offen&s;ive and fetid breath, (particularly children who&s;e powers of dige&s;tion are by no means equal to the too great quantity of &s;trong and improper food they commonly take in); which idea perhaps may be one motive why the French have &s;uch frequent recour&s;e to <HI>lavement,</HI> or cly&s;ter. I &s;ay it has been already ob&s;erved that our blood is made from what we take into the &s;tomach, from whence is prepared that milky liquid called chyle, which forms the ba&s;is of the blood, the whole proce&s;s of which is per|formed within the &s;pace of twenty-four hours; after which period the feces or excrement can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e by remaining in the body, &s;ince all their nutritive and e&s;&s;ential parts (good or bad, which depends upon the nature of the food &s;o taken in and &s;tate of the &s;tomach) has been extracted for the above purpo&s;e. Now as the feces in the mo&s;t healthy con&s;titutions are rendered highly offen&s;ive when di&s;charged at the end, or in the cour&s;e of that time, how much more putrid mu&s;t they inevitably become if retained for days or weeks, as is very
<PB N="12" REF="17">often the ca&s;e in relaxed and weak habits, more e&s;pecially &s;uch as lead &s;edentary and inactive lives!</P>
<P>During the alterative cour&s;e it will be highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the patient to ob&s;erve &s;uch mode in diet as is calculated to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the intention of the medicine, by avoiding all &s;alted, high-&s;ea&s;oned, and inflammatory food; yet notwith&s;tanding to partake of &s;uch proper innocent and nouri&s;hing food as is &s;ufficient to keep up the bodily &s;trength and pro|duce good juices; for my wi&s;h is not to reduce the patient's &s;trength, only to conquer the di&s;ea&s;e, and by &s;upporting the con&s;titution properly they will be the better enabled to obtain that end. But as it is impo&s;&s;ible to give a bill of fare &s;uitable to every con&s;titution, palate, and &s;ituation in life, &s;uffice it, therefore, to &s;ay, that the food &s;hould be &s;imple, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, nutritive, plain dre&s;&s;ed, and mo|derately taken; that is, not to load the &s;tomach with too much at one time, but rather to eat as in|&s;tinctive animals do in a &s;tate of nature, little and often&mdash;a hint from thence is no bad precedent, for nature will ever be found to exceed the be&s;t philo&s;o|phical rea&s;onings of art.</P>
<P>After what has been already &s;aid, I think it al|mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add, that &s;uch as are accu&s;tomed to take phy&s;ic in the &s;pring and autumn will find this the be&s;t they can have recour&s;e to. Indeed no per&s;on, however healthy, would be the wor&s;e for employing this friendly &s;cavenger once or twice a
<PB N="13" REF="18">month; and all &s;uch who are &s;o unfortunate as to labour under a <HI>very fa&s;hionable di&s;ea&s;e</HI> will find the&s;e pills a mo&s;t certain remedy, <HI>(taken agreeable to the alterative cour&s;e ju&s;t laid down),</HI> without having their bodies loaded, like a barometer, with mercury, owing to the too liberal u&s;e of which, in the pre&s;ent practice, many un&s;ortunate beings (though cured of that di&s;ea&s;e) are left a wreck, &s;ubject, like the ma|thematical in&s;trument, to every vici&s;&s;itude of wea|ther, to trail out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Women al&s;o at the turn of life would do well to pay &s;trict attention to this medicine, being in every re&s;pect calculated to carry off the humours which nature often, embarra&s;&s;ed with at that critical pe|riod, throws on the legs and other parts of the body, rendering the remainder of their days painful, and often burden&s;ome.</P>
<P>And even women with child need not be afraid to take the&s;e pills (becau&s;e they &s;ometimes vomit) to remove that co&s;tivene&s;s they are commonly &s;ubject to in that &s;ituation. Since vomiting is a natural at|tendant upon pregnant women, (and &s;ometimes vio|lently &s;o) particularly in their fir&s;t pregnancy, which the wi&s;dom of Providence has &s;o ordered, no doubt, for the be&s;t of ends; and if any danger was likely to en&s;ue from that operation, we might &s;urely ex|pect it at that time, when all the bowels are more than ordinarily compre&s;&s;ed from the exten&s;ion of the uterus and weight of the foetus; yet who ever
<PB N="14" REF="19">heard of any &s;uch women being injured by vo|miting?</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my practice I never met with any in&s;tance of the kind; on the contrary, I always found it relieved, and made them more cheerful and ea&s;y. Again, how frequently do people at &s;ea go through that operation &s;everal times a day for weeks together without any bad con&s;equences from the operation it&s;elf? And even hectic people, and others who have been to all appearance at the la&s;t ga&s;p, and given over by their phy&s;ician, by making a &s;ea voyage have been effectually relieved by that operation, and returned home, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all that knew them, perfectly &s;ound and hearty; and yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e evident proofs be|fore their eyes, mo&s;t people are terri&s;ied at taking an emetic.</P>
<P>As the greate&s;t inconveniency which attends this operation (particularly in co&s;tive habits) ari&s;es from wind pent up in the bowels, which &s;ometimes occa|&s;ion griping pains therein during the action of an emetic; that might in a great mea&s;ure, if not alto|gether, be prevented by admini&s;tering the following or &s;ome &s;uch cly&s;ter previous to taking any thing of the emetic kind, viz. Take about half a pint of gruel or broth of any kind, a table &s;poonful of common &s;alt, three large &s;poon&s;uls of vinegar, and as much of oil, mixed, makes one for a grown per|&s;on. In &s;hort, wind being, from that nece&s;&s;ary de|licacy
<PB N="15" REF="20">ob&s;erved in &s;ociety, often kept back when nature is di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;charge it, lays the foundation of innumerable tormenting complaints; the wind &s;o re&s;trained I have frequently, when &s;itting in com|pany, heard rumbling for a con&s;iderable time in the bowels of a per&s;on &s;everal &s;eats from me. And once travelling in a &s;tage coach, (from Stamford to Lon|don) a poor woman therein, from a circum&s;tance of this &s;ort, was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed and put to the blu&s;h from the tittering of two unfeeling young men (farmers to appearance) fellow travellers: &s;he &s;oon after grew pale, and was about to faint when I &s;topped the coach, and got her out in the air; upon which &s;he fell into a &s;trong hy&s;teric fit, that held above half an hour, in the cour&s;e of which &s;he ex|pelled an immen&s;e deal of wind both upwards, &amp;c., which contributed to her recovery. I mention this ju&s;t to prove how little a matter will put the boa&s;ted human machine out of &s;orts, and to reprobate the unfeeling conduct of &s;uch as can enjoy a laugh at the painful misfortunes of their fellow creatures, particularly of that &s;ex who command our mo&s;t hu|mane and affectionate attention, being, from the pe|culiar re&s;traint their mode&s;ty lays them under, liable to many inconveniences which men are not.</P>
<P>In the year 1770 the following extraordinary ca&s;e occurred at Mahon, in the i&s;land of Minorca: &mdash; William Kearns, a &s;oldier of the Old Buffs, was &s;itting on a &s;tone &s;eat by the guard-room door, be|tween the hours of nine and ten at night, with &s;e|veral
<PB N="16" REF="21">others of the guard. His comrade, on pa&s;&s;ing by him to the guard room, in play, put him&s;elf in a boxing attitude, &s;aying, <Q>"Have at you, Kearns; I can lick you now."</Q> Upon which Kearns threw his head back &s;uddenly again&s;t the wall, the di&s;|tance about &s;ix inches, which made him call out, &s;eemingly diplea&s;ed, <Q>"Damn you, me&s;&s;mate, that's no joke&mdash;I believe you have made me break my &s;conce."</Q> Then taking off his hat, he rubbed the back of his head with his hand, &s;aying, <Q>"I will be up with you for this."</Q> The other ran laughing into the guard room.&mdash;Kearns continued afterwards above half an hour &s;itting at the door, talking as u&s;ual to the other men, without appearing the lea&s;t indi&s;po&s;ed, or &s;aying any thing more about his head. He then went in and laid down on the guard bed. At twelve o'clock, being to go &s;entinel, and not turning out with the relief, the corporal, thinking he was a&s;leep, went in to rou&s;e him, and &s;ound him lying on his &s;ide foaming at the mouth, &s;peechle&s;s, and his eyes wide open. The corporal then called to &s;ome of the men to come and &s;ee him, and they tried to rai&s;e him up; upon which he fetched a deep groan and expired. One of the men ran to Mr. Duffy, &s;urgeon to the 67th regiment, who lived almo&s;t oppo&s;ite the guard hou&s;e, and another to me, about half a mile di&s;tant. Mr. Duffy went to him immediately, and opened the temple artery; but it was too late&mdash;he was dead. Upon my arrival &s;oon after I learnt the preceding account. We then out off his hair, and carefully examined the head
<PB N="17" REF="22">and every part, but could not perceive the &s;malle&s;t external injury what&s;oever, except a very &s;light ex|trava&s;ation of blood behind the left ear, the &s;ide he lay on the guard bed. About one o'clock that day I opened the head of the decea&s;ed in pre&s;ence of Dr. Monro, phy&s;ician to the garri&s;on, Mr. Duffy, and anoher &s;urgeon; when we found about two ounces (not more) of coagulated blood on the right anterior hemi&s;phere of the brain, which appeared to have i&s;&s;ued from a ve&s;&s;el of the dura mater; every other part of the membranes, brain, ventri|cles, &amp;c., &amp;c., were in as &s;ound and perfect a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible; the head was uncommonly full of brain, and the &s;cull remarkably thin, and in many places quite diaphanous.</P>
<P>Dr. Monro immediately waited on General John|&s;ton, the Governor of the I&s;land, to report his own and our opinion of this ca&s;e; and Mr. Duffy and I proceeded to open the body, not in expectation of finding any thing farther relative to the cau&s;e of this man's death, but from a cu&s;tom I always followed of opening the body of every &s;oldier that died. Upon rai&s;ing the brea&s;t bone a very uncommon fulne&s;s ap|peared on the left &s;ide about the heart, and on divi|ding the pericardium a great quantity of very fetid wind i&s;&s;ued forth, and about four table &s;poonfuls of clear lymph. The heart of this man (who was a very &s;tout, well-made &s;oldier, thirty-two years of age, and about five feet eight inches high) was un|commonly &s;mall indeed, (weighing only fifteen
<PB N="18" REF="23">ounces five drams Troy) and looked as if it had been parboiled. The lungs, liver, &s;tomach, and all the other entrails, were in as &s;ound and perfect a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible, and in every other re&s;pect formed as much for longevity as any I ever &s;aw in my life. I have been the more particular in &s;tating all the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e from the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of his death, <HI>and the very extraordinary contents of the pericardium</HI> and &s;tate of the heart, leaving the deci|&s;ion of the real cau&s;e of this man's death to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;uperior &s;kill and micro&s;copic di&s;cernment may enable them to give a better &s;olution to it than I chu&s;e to ri&s;k my opinion in giving; at the &s;ame time to &s;hew <HI>that windy complaints</HI> are (what I have al|ready &s;aid of them) numerous, wonderful, and often puzzling, and therefore how nece&s;&s;ary it is <HI>that all dead bodies &s;hould be opened</HI> for information &s;ake, &s;ince the dead cannot be injured, and the living may benefit by it.&mdash;This ca&s;e I have &s;ingled out from &s;everal others which I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion relative to windy tumours di&s;covered by di&s;&s;ection. I beg leave to add, that this man had once or twice been troubled with a &s;light a&s;thmatic complaint; but in every other re&s;pect was as healthy, to all appearance, as any &s;oldier in the regiment.</P>
<P>To return again to the &s;ubject of emetics.</P>
<P>Some time ago I was called to a gentleman, a very free liver, and an extraordinary hard drinker, who I make no doubt had a hundred times in his life vomited mo&s;t &s;everely from inebriety, infinitely
<PB N="19" REF="24">more &s;o than he would have done from any common emetic given by the faculty; notwith&s;tanding which, upon my propo&s;ing a vomit for him, which his &s;ituation ab&s;olutely required, he immediately held up his hands, begging for God's &s;ake he might not take an emetic; <HI>that he was too weak;</HI> that it would &s;train him to pieces and kill him. He, however, got an emetic, and obtained the wanted relief.&mdash;I &s;ay again, that, after all the&s;e incontrovertible ex|amples, it &s;eems to me mo&s;t &s;trange that a rational being &s;hould be &s;o much afraid of this operation, when many of the brute part of the creation (that feed carnivorou&s;ly) take &s;uch things as in&s;tinct di|rects them to in order to di&s;charge the offending contents of their &s;tomach that way; and I have &s;een a hawk di&s;gorge the contents of his craw: but I believe no per&s;on ever &s;aw an ox, or an a&s;s, a goat, or gander, vomit, of cour&s;e nature never intended it.</P>
<P>Here, by the by, though foreign to the &s;ubject of the&s;e leaves, permit me, however, to offer a hint about the treatment of hor&s;es, which noble animal I am clearly of opinion has been often tortured, <HI>if not killed,</HI> by having things of the emetic kind ad|mini&s;tered, &s;ince a hor&s;e can no more vomit than an a&s;s, though I once heard a gentleman declare that he &s;aw a dead hor&s;e vomit after having Dr. James's powders given him when alive; but as this is a mat|ter I may perhaps treat more at large on &s;ome future day, I &s;hall clo&s;e it here, only adding, that I am &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="20" REF="25">from all I have &s;een and heard that many medicines that are u&s;ed by mankind are totally im|proper and highly dangerous for &s;uch animals as feed granivorou&s;ly and cannot vomit. But how this er|roneous method of treating hor&s;es as human beings has become the practice could be very ea&s;ily ac|counted for.</P>
<P>Vomiting is, I mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s, a very unplea&s;ant operation; but, believe me, it is a much more &s;peedy and effectual method of relieving the &s;tomach of its offending contents than carrying it off by the other channel, through all the turnings, fe&s;toonings, and curvatures of the lower bowels, in the cells of which &s;ome of the feces will frequently &s;tick and lodge for weeks, nay months together, forming that nidus of mi&s;chief I have before men|tioned, of which the following is a ca&s;e in point:&mdash;A &s;oldier of the third regiment of foot (in which I &s;erved &s;everal years) was &s;eized with a cholic in the latter end of September, 1771, at Exeter, where we were at that time quartered after returning from Minorca, which place we left in the month of May preceding, and arrived in England the beginning of June. As we were in a cyder country, I &s;u&s;pected his complaint might ari&s;e from drinking that li|quor: but he a&s;&s;ured me that he had not drank any cyder; that he did not like it. However, after ta|king a few do&s;es of rhubarb, and &s;ome other little things, his complaint went off, and he returned to his duty; but being a few days after attacked again
<PB N="21" REF="26">with the &s;ame di&s;order in a mo&s;t violent degree, he was taken into the ho&s;pital&mdash;every thing he took came off his &s;tomach immediately, and, in &s;pite of every effort, no pa&s;&s;age could be procured down|wards. Being now exceedingly alarmed for the &s;afety of my patient, I directed <HI>one of my pills</HI> to be given every hour until they &s;hould operate by &s;tool; the two fir&s;t pills made him rather &s;ick, but did not vomit him: after taking &s;ix, they began to operate downwards, and in one of the di&s;charges he brought off a great quantity, near a handful, of <HI>grape &s;kins,</HI> highly <HI>putrid and offen&s;ive.</HI> From that hour his violent pain went off, and in a week he was perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>Que&s;tioning him now about this appearance <HI>and evident cau&s;e of his complaint,</HI> I a&s;ked if he had eat any rai&s;ins, either alone or in pudding. He a&s;&s;ured me he had not taken any thing of the kind &s;ince he was on &s;hip board; but that on his leaving Minorca a friend gave him &s;everal pounds of <HI>dried grapes</HI> by way of &s;ea &s;tock; that he eat them all on his pa&s;&s;age, and from that time had never ta&s;ted any thing of the kind. He remembered, he &s;aid, that the grapes griped him often in the &s;ame place as when he fir&s;t applied to me, but not &s;o much as to occa&s;ion an ap|plication then, as the pain generally went off with a motion, and he thought they did him good. How|ever, it is very clear that a part of this tra&s;h remain|ed in his body near four months. Be&s;ides this, &s;e|veral
<PB N="22" REF="27">other &s;imilar ca&s;es have occurred to me in the cour&s;e of practice.</P>
<P>Gouty habits, and all tho&s;e who live freely either in eating or drinking, (for the rea&s;ons already &s;tated concerning the &s;tomach and bowels) will find this a &s;overeign remedy for the &s;udden and violent attacks which &s;uch are often &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be a&s;ked how can any one medicine be good for &s;o many different complaints as the au|thor has mentioned? To which I an&s;wer, BECAUSE IT IS AN ALTERATIVE! By which it is meant, that all &s;uch offending humours in the body as <HI>nature</HI> is not able of her&s;elf to throw off, are, by means of this medicine, &s;o changed, di&s;po&s;ed, and rendered capable of expul&s;ion by the proper channels or out|lets, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>her efforts</HI> in removing them effec|tually.&mdash;And now I beg leave, in turn, to a&s;k of all tho&s;e good folks who &s;train at a gnat and &s;wallow a camel, how it happens that antimony, bark, mer|cury, and even &s;everal in&s;ignificant and other medi|cines which I could mention, are made u&s;e of by all and every phy&s;ician and medical practitioner <HI>as ge|neral remedies</HI> for almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e that falls under their cognizance? And la&s;tly, though often too late, why the patient is recommended <HI>to that univer&s;al re|medy,</HI> Bath water, &amp;c., when the doctor can do no more for him?</P>
<PB N="23" REF="28">
<P>I &s;hall not, however, pre&s;ume to impo&s;e &s;o far upon the under&s;tanding of the Public as to endea|vour to maintain that my pills are an infallible reme|dy for all the di&s;ea&s;es to which human nature is in|cident: but thus much I venture po&s;itively and boldly to a&s;&s;ert, that I do not believe it is in the power of chemical or medical art to compo&s;e a bet|ter medicine, a milder and more COMPLETE ALTERATIVE out of the drugs, &amp;c. in pre&s;ent u&s;e. But what future time may produce I cannot pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Surgeons of the army and navy, (without dero|gating from their abilities) by providing them&s;elves with the&s;e pills, would have a remedy immediately at hand, (which their &s;ituations &s;ometimes will not admit them to get &s;ea&s;onably prepared) by which means many valuable lives might be &s;aved, and them&s;elves &s;pared much trouble and expence; but particularly ma&s;ters of merchant &s;hips, <HI>who have no medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> (more e&s;pecially &s;uch as vi&s;it warm climates, where bilious complaints are mo&s;t preva|lent) and al&s;o tho&s;e who live in the country remote from <HI>&s;uch aid,</HI> would find The poor Man's Medicine Che&s;t (what I have ju&s;tly termed it) a mo&s;t invalua|ble remedy.</P>
<P>Here it may not be improper to give a little ad|vice to tho&s;e al&s;o who vi&s;it Margate and other water|ing places, in the &s;ea&s;on, for the benefit of their healths, from whence many return wor&s;e than they
<PB N="24" REF="29">went, and numbers lo&s;e their lives from injudicious bathing. Though I am convinced from experience that the u&s;e of the cold bath, when properly ap|plied, is of the highe&s;t importance towards pre|&s;erving of health, yet it &s;hould never be had re|cour&s;e to until the body is fir&s;t properly prepared, not by a few do&s;es of &s;alt water, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e, which &s;lips quickly through the bowels, lea|ving behind the long-retained feces, &amp;c., <HI>which I have &s;o pointedly de&s;cribed,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no powers to act upon them effectually: for give me leave to ac|quaint tho&s;e who think that one thing that opens the body is as good as another, that they are mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, for, in fact, there is as much difference between one purgative and another as be|tween wine and water; for though both of the&s;e will allay thir&s;t, yet they will not equally exhilerate the &s;pirits and produce intoxication. Permit me, therefore, mo&s;t humbly to recommend to all &s;uch as vi&s;it tho&s;e places, <HI>for their health's &s;ake,</HI> previou&s;ly to prepare them&s;elves for a fortnight or three weeks with my pills, agreeable to the <HI>alterative cour&s;e</HI> laid down in page 10, convinced they will find their advantage in &s;o doing. Afterwards, I have no objec|tion to their drinking occa&s;ionally a do&s;e of &s;alt water, if they like it, to keep the body gently open, being perfectly proper the body &s;hould be &s;o kept during a cour&s;e of bathing.</P>
<P>There is one hint more, and that of no &s;mall im|portance, which I &s;hall pre&s;ume to offer to bathers,
<PB N="25" REF="30">which is to live <HI>temperately and regularly</HI> whil&s;t they are &s;eeking relief from the bath, and not go into it hi&s;&s;ing hot, like an iron out of a &s;mith's forge plunged into his trough, after &s;itting up all night, and partaking mo&s;t unmercifully of all the luxuries of the &s;ea&s;on; which mi&s;conduct I am fully per|&s;uaded has brought numbers to an untimely grave!</P>
<P>I could offer &s;ome other u&s;eful remarks upon this &s;ubject; but as it would extend this little work beyond the limits propo&s;ed, I &s;hall re&s;erve them for another place. For the &s;ame rea&s;on I &s;hall al&s;o omit many re&s;pectable and well-authenticated vou|chers, which I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of the won|derful effects my pills have already produced; but indeed I could rather wi&s;h they &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves by their future good works, than endea|vour to &s;upport them by anterior authorities.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it a duty I owe the Public, as well as my&s;elf, to make a remark or two more; and although it is neither my talent nor wi&s;h to depreciate the productions of others with a view to enhance the value of my own, yet it is but ju&s;|tice to draw a fair line between mine and &s;ome of the pills which are at pre&s;ent in much-e&s;teemed u&s;e, not doubting at the &s;ame time but &s;uch are ju&s;tly entitled to the approbation they have obtained from the benefit tho&s;e who u&s;ed them have experienced, and who think them&s;elves, no doubt, as much in|debted to them for &s;uch relief as they would have
<PB N="26" REF="31">been to the pre&s;criptions of the late Sir Richard Jebb, or any great phy&s;ician of the pre&s;ent day, of the ingredients of who&s;e pre&s;criptions they had no more knowledge than of tho&s;e that con&s;tituted &s;uch pills; and therefore I humbly pre&s;ume it is of very little con&s;equence to the party who is &s;o relieved, whether obtained from Sir Jeffery Dun&s;tan, Mayor of Garratt, or the Vicar of Bray! But as one watch excels another in regulating time, &s;o may one medicine &s;urpa&s;s another in momentous e&s;&s;icacy. Many of tho&s;e pills, then, which I &s;hall forbear to call by name, le&s;t I &s;hould incur the appellation of being envious, and increa&s;e the number of my op|ponents, being only calculated to act merely as a purgative, can by no means come in <HI>competition with</HI> what I have a&s;&s;erted (and on which I pledge my re|putation) <HI>mine</HI> will be &s;ound to per&s;orm; con&s;e|quently a medicine of this &s;ort has long been want|ing. Therefore, without entertaining an iota of doubt but I &s;hall in due time receive from a generous Public the approbation I &s;eek <HI>for the offering made,</HI> I &s;hall now conclude with an old but ju&s;t proverb &mdash;</P>
<Q>&mdash; Siquid novi&s;ti re&s;lius i&s;lis, Candidus imperti: &s;i non, his utere me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um.</Q>
<P>&rindx; Having entitled my box of pills The poor Man's Medicine Che&s;t! it remains for me to main|tain that appellation. The&s;e pills, then, are put up in boxes at four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, and ton &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, <HI>&s;lamps</HI> included. The &s;mall
<PB N="27" REF="32">box contains forty-eight pills, or twelve large do&s;es. Now as a common do&s;e is but three, and &s;ome re|quire only two pills, it will often happen that this box may contain twenty do&s;es; and whoever is obliged to have recour&s;e to an apothecary for an equal number of do&s;es of medicine would have at lea&s;t twenty &s;hillings to pay, exclu&s;ive of &s;ome con|&s;ideration for his trouble and attendance, and per|haps not receive as much benefit from the whole as from one do&s;e of the&s;e pills. The large box con|tains one hundred and twenty pills, or thirty large do&s;es.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, the pills will be &s;old by the Proprietor only, at his Patent Baume of Arquebu|&s;ade Warehou&s;e, No. 13, Leice&s;ter Street, Leice&s;ter Square; (the u&s;e of which Baume has been found, as will appear by the annexed letters, of the highe&s;t importance); but as &s;oon as proper per&s;ons are ap|pointed to vend them, their names will be affixed to this publication; and the better to prevent impo&s;i|tions, each box is &s;ealed with his coat of arms &mdash; Motto, <HI>Confido in Deo!</HI></P>
<P>The Public are reque&s;ted to pay &s;trict attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;ince there are a number of medica&s;ters and other piratical wretches ever ready to obtrude on the world their own dangerous imita|tions for the works of others, (preying like the hornet on the honey of the indu&s;trious bee) under a pretence of being able to analy&s;e, without knowing
<PB N="28" REF="33">the nature of that arduous and nice proce&s;s, and many of tho&s;e pretenders not even the meaning of the word; by which means a mo&s;t valuable medi|cine lo&s;es its reputation, and the Public are de|ceived.</P>

<P>I SHOULD think my&s;elf lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of gra|titude if I did not acknowledge that, under God, you have been the &s;aver of my life by the u&s;e of your <HI>Baume d'Arquebu&s;ade;</HI> and I am now happy in acquainting you that all tho&s;e violent pains in my &s;tomach and bowels, as well as my loins and kidnies,

<P>I BEG leave to expre&s;s my gratitude, as an in|dividual, for the obligation you have con&s;erred on mankind by the di&s;covery of your <HI>Baume d'Arque|bu&s;ade,</HI> and al&s;o to inform you of the benefit I have derived from it. I had been afflicted three years with a violent bilious complaint, attended with con|&s;tant &s;evers, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, violent head-achs, &amp;c., &amp;c. I applied to &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent of the faculty, and took all the medicines which were recommended: went twice to Bath for the be|ne&s;it of the waters; the fir&s;t time of u&s;ing them found my&s;elf much wor&s;e, as they increa&s;ed my fever, head-ach, &amp;c.; the &s;econd time they had little or no effect. I at length de&s;paired of a re|medy, and thought all I could hope was to prevent the complaint's increa&s;ing by a &s;trict regard to diet, when I heard of the wonderful effects of your <HI>Baume d'Arquebu&s;ade,</HI> and re&s;olved to try it. At fir&s;t it would not &s;tay on my &s;tomach, and occa&s;ioned &s;aint|ne&s;s and burning &s;en&s;ation in my throat: though I was rather di&s;couraged by tho&s;e unplea&s;ant effects, I however determined to give it a fair trial, and by the time I had &s;ini&s;hed the fir&s;t bottle the&s;e effects cea&s;ed, and I began to find benefit. In about three months I became perfectly free from all complaints, and have ever &s;ince enjoyed a confirmed &s;tate of health.&mdash;I have no objection to your publi&s;hing this letter, if you think proper; and am ready to an|&s;wer,

<P>"I CANNOT conclude my letter without ren|dering your merit the tribute of prai&s;e &s;o ju&s;tly due for pre&s;enting to mankind that mo&s;t excellent medi|cine, the <HI>concentrated Bal&s;am of Arquebu&s;ade,</HI> which, by having taken a &s;ew bottles, has relieved me from a very dangerous bilious complaint, and for which I tried the Bath waters la&s;t &s;ummer, upwards of &s;ix weeks, in vain, after having previou&s;ly been under the care of a very eminent phy&s;ician a con&s;iderable time.&mdash;If this declaration of mine can be of any &s;er|vice to you, you have &s;ull permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hew it to all a&s;&s;licted with that dreadful di&s;order, from which I have been &s;o happily relieved.

<P>"YOUR Arquebu&s;ade Concentre <HI>is of the utmo&s;t u&s;e to us.</HI> I have never yet applied it inwardly; but in brui&s;es, &s;prains, &s;evere cuts, and rheumntic com|plaints, it has never failed. One negro, who chopped half his finger off at the joint, had his wound healed by it as if it had been by magic: another, who&s;e leg was violently tore by a dog, equally &s;o. My Over&s;eer's foot was jammed by a cart, and it cured him in a &s;ew days. We u&s;e it for all &s;ores in ne|groes legs, and it never fails.
