<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in November la&s;t, I began to make Experi|ments on Animal Electricity, of which I read &s;ome account to the Royal Society on the 3d of December; I was not only much hurried with bu&s;ine&s;s, but could not procure a &s;ufficient number of Frogs for the purpo&s;e. Du|ring the la&s;t winter and &s;pring, I pro&s;ecuted the &s;ubject more fully and with greater attention; and, on the third day of June, I read a &s;econd paper to the Royal Society, to which I have, &s;ince that time, made additions. I &s;hall now &s;tate a &s;ummary of the chief circum&s;tances I have ob&s;erved, with a few Remarks.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CIRCULATING AND NER|VOUS SYSTEMS OF FROGS.</HEAD>
<P>As my Experiments with Opium, as well as tho&s;e on Animal Electricity, have been performed on Frogs chiefly; I &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome ob&s;ervations on their Circulating and Nervous Sy&s;tems.</P>
<P>THEIR Heart con&s;i&s;ts of one Auricle and one Ventricle only, their Aorta &s;upplying their Air Ve&s;icles or Lungs, as well as all their other Organs; and, of cour&s;e, their Venae Cavae return the Blood from all parts to the Heart. The Ventricle of their Heart contracts about &s;ixty times in a minute; and the purple colour of the Blood which is &s;een within it, di&s;appears after each contraction, or the Blood is entirely expelled by its contraction. For upwards of an hour after cutting out its Heart, a Frog can crawl or jump; and, for upwards of half an hour longer, it contracts its
<PB N="7" REF="5">Legs when the Toes are hurt, though not with &s;ufficient force to move its Body from the place where it is laid.</P>
<P>THEIR Encephalon con&s;i&s;ts of Brain and Cerebellum, each of which, on its upper part, is divided into two He|mi&s;pheres; and, below, they are conjoined by thick Crura, which form the Medulla Oblongata and Spinal Marrow, both of which are proportionally larger than in Man, and more evidently con&s;i&s;t of two Cords. There are nine true Vertebrae; and at the &s;ixth of the&s;e, the Spinal Marrow terminates in the Cauda Equina. The Sciatic Nerves are formed by three pairs of Nerves, &s;ent out below the &s;eventh, eighth and ninth Vertebrae, and by one pair from the Os Sacrum. A Nerve, re&s;embling our great Sympathetic Nerve, pa&s;&s;es downwards from the Abdomen into the Pel|vis.</P>
<P>Two days after cutting off the Head of a Frog at its joining with the fir&s;t Vertebra, I found it &s;itting with its Legs drawn up, in their u&s;ual po&s;ture; and when its Toes were hurt, it jumped with very con&s;iderable force. Its Heart likewi&s;e continued to beat about forty times in a mi|nute, and &s;o &s;trongly as to empty it&s;elf and circulate the Blood.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P>IN &s;everal Frogs, after cutting off the back part of the &s;ix undermo&s;t true Vertebrae, I took out all that part of the Spinal Marrow with the Cauda Equina which they cover. The lower Extremities were rendered in&s;en&s;ible to common injuries, and lay motionle&s;s; yet the Frogs lived &s;everal months thereafter, and the wounded parts of their Backs cicatri&s;ed; and the Bones of their Legs, which I fractured, were re-united, the Blood circulating freely in their Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>IT is univer&s;ally known, that if, after amputating the Limb of a warm blooded Animal, we repeatedly irritate the Nerves which terminate in Mu&s;cles, repeated Convul|&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles are for &s;ome time produced; and that in Frogs, and other cold blooded Animals, the Nerves retain this power &s;till longer.</P>
<P>BUT it has been commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that, after irri|tating the Nerve a given number of times, the effect cea&s;es, Authors conceiving that there is lodged in the Nerve &s;ome fluid, or other energy which is exhau&s;ted by repeated ex|plo&s;ions. In&s;tead of this, I have found that the time the Nerves pre&s;erve their power is the &s;ame, whether we irritate them or not; or that their energy is not ex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="9" REF="7">by irritation, unle&s;s the irritation be &s;uch as &s;en|&s;ibly alters their texture.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="experiments">
<HEAD>EXPERIMENTS WITH OPIUM.</HEAD>
<P>I CUT one hole in the fore and upper part of the Cra|nium and Dura Mater of a Frog, and another in the back part of the lowermo&s;t Vertebrae, and then injected, from the one hole to the other, a &s;mall &s;yringe full of water, in five ounces of which one ounce of Opium had been infu&s;ed for three days. The infu&s;ion, by this means brought into contact with the whole &s;urface of the Encephalon and Spi|nal Marrow, produced almo&s;t in&s;tantly univer&s;al convul|&s;ions; and, in le&s;s than two minutes thereafter, the Ani|mal was incapable of moving its body from the place where it was laid. A quarter of an hour thereafter, I found the Heart beating twenty-five times only in the minute; and &s;o feebly, that it could not entirely expel the Blood. When
<PB N="10" REF="8">half an hour thereafter, the Sciatic Nerves were pinched, a &s;light tremor only was excited in the Mu&s;cles of the Leg; and Animal Electricity produced but feeble twitchings of the Mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>THE infu&s;ion of Opium, injected in the &s;ame manner in Rabbits and in a Pig, produced &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P>I HAD long ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Edin. Phy&s;. E&s;&s;. Vol. III.</NOTE> ob&s;erved, that an infu&s;ion of Opium, poured into the Cavity of the Abdomen of a Frog, after cutting out its Heart, occa&s;ioned, in a few minutes, con|vul&s;ions of its hind Legs. I have &s;ince found, that, after cutting off the Head, and cutting out the Heart of a Frog, its hind Legs are con&s;iderably weakened by pouring an in|fu&s;ion of Opium into the Cavity of its Abdomen.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH an infu&s;ion of Opium poured into the Auricle and Ventricle of the Heart of a Frog, in&s;tantly renders that Organ incapable of contraction, and, even after the Aorta has been previou&s;ly cut, occa&s;ions convul&s;ions of the Legs, yet I have not found that by Opium applied to the Brain, the Spinal Marrow, the Heart, or Abdominal Vi&s;cera, the Mu&s;cles of the Legs were &s;o entirely killed as not to per|form
<PB N="11" REF="9">&s;ome motion when their Nerves were pinched, or when they were acted on by Animal Electricity.</P>
<P>AFTER taking out the lower half of the Spinal Marrow, and likewi&s;e cutting tran&s;ver&s;ely all the parts at the Pelvis, except the Crural Arteries and Veins and Lymphatics, which probably accompany them, I found that an infu&s;ion of Opium, applied to the Skin and Mu&s;cles of the Legs, affected the &s;uperior parts of the Body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Edin. Phy&s;. E&s;&s;. Vol. III.</NOTE>: more probably, in my opinion, by ab&s;orption, than through any minute remanent branches of the Nerves, e&s;pecially as I do not find, on laying the Ve&s;&s;els &s;o prepared over a gold probe, and touching with it Zinc laid under the Spine, that con|vul&s;ions of the Legs can be excited. At the &s;ame time, the quantity of Opium ab&s;orbed is &s;o &s;mall, that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h its &s;mell or ta&s;te in the Blood; nor did I find the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hable, in other Experiments, in which the Frogs were violently convul&s;ed after applying the infu&s;ion to the &s;urface of their Skin.</P>
<P>ANIMAL Electricity or different metals applied to the Head of a Frog, or to any part of its Spine above its &s;ixth Vertebra, do not occa&s;ion convul&s;ions of its hind Legs.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="corollaries">
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<HEAD>COROLLARIES FROM THE ABOVE FACTS AND EX|PERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the above Facts and Experiments, it appears,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the Frog, after its Head is cut off, feels pain, and, in con&s;equence of feeling, moves its Body and Limbs.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As the Nerves of the hind Legs are not affected by Animal Electricity, unle&s;s it be applied lower than the fifth Vertebra, the&s;e Nerves do not &s;eem to be derived &s;olely or chiefly from the Brain or Cerebellum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As Opium, after the Circulation cea&s;es, affects Organs di&s;tant from tho&s;e to which it is applied, it is beyond doubt, that the latter &s;uffer in con&s;equence of Sympathy of Nerves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. IT appears that, in this Animal, there is Sympathy of Nerves after the Head is cut off; or that Sympathy of
<PB N="13" REF="11">Nerves does not, in this Animal, depend entirely on the connection of Nerves within the Head.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. As, after cutting off the Head, this Animal is &s;u&s;cep|tible of pain, and, in con&s;equence of that, performs volun|tary motion, it appears that, in it, the Brain is not the &s;ole &s;eat of the <HI>Sen&s;orium Commune.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. SEVERAL weeks after I had taken out the lowermo&s;t half of the Spinal Marrow, and with it the Cauda Equina, I daily applied, for four days running, Animal Electricity to the Sciatic Nerves, by pa&s;&s;ing a gold Probe between them and the Os Sacrum, and excited &s;everal hundreds of convul&s;ions of the Thighs and Legs, and yet found that, on laying bare the Femoral Nerves, and pinching them, the Mu&s;cles were &s;lightly convul&s;ed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>HENCE, I apprehend, additional force is given to an opinion I ventured many years ago to propo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ob&s;ervations on the Nervous Sy&s;tem, 1783, Chap. x. and xi.</NOTE>, that the Nerves do not receive their energy wholly from the Head and Spinal Marrow, but that the texture of every branch of a Nerve is &s;uch as to furni&s;h it, or that the &s;tructure of each Nerve is &s;imilar to that of the Brain.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12">
<P N="7">7. FROM the above Experiments, it appears probable, in the highe&s;t degree, that Opium may be ab&s;orbed in &s;uch quantity as to produce fatal &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE following circum&s;tances concur in rendering in|admi&s;&s;ible an opinion lately propo&s;ed by M. FONTANA, that Poi&s;ons operate by changes they produce on the ma&s;s of Blood, or on &s;ome unknown principle connected with the Blood.</P>
<P>a. IF his opinion was ju&s;t, Poi&s;on introduced into a Vein of the extremities, &s;o as to be in contact with this unknown principle, &s;hould operate as quickly, and in the &s;ame man|ner as when the Poi&s;on is mixed with the Blood near the Heart, which he admits is not the ca&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See FONTANA &s;ur les Poi&s;ons, 1781, p. 267.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>b. CUTTING the Spinal Marrow in Frogs, before apply|ing the Poi&s;on of the Viper to their Legs, prevents it from killing them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See FONTANA, p. 293.</NOTE>; which &s;hould not happen, if the Poi&s;on act|ed on the Blood alone.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>c. HE acknowledges that an Animal bit in its Leg by a Viper, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly feels acute pain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FONTANA, p. 244.</NOTE>; and it, in like manner, feels in&s;tantly great unea&s;ine&s;s when the Poi&s;on is mixed with its Blood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">FONTANA, p. 259.</NOTE>. We know for certain, that, through the medium of the Nerves, we are in&s;tantly ren|dered &s;en&s;ible of injury done to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of our Bodies.</P>
<P>ARE we not, therefore, in the la&s;t mentioned Experi|ment, to conclude, that the unea&s;ine&s;s was produced be|cau&s;e the Poi&s;on acted upon the Nerves of the Ve&s;&s;els?</P>
<P>d. IN like manner, Animals were convul&s;ed as &s;oon as they were wounded, or received the Poi&s;on into a Blood|ve&s;&s;el; and long before the Blood could have reached the Mu&s;cles in action<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">FONTANA, p. 112. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>e. As &s;oon as the di&s;tilled Water of Lauro-cera&s;us was poured into the Stomach of a Pigeon, it was convul&s;ed, and
<PB N="16" REF="14">died in&s;tantly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FONTANA, p. 142.</NOTE>, that is, before the Poi&s;on could have entered the Ma&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>f. MANY years ago, I found, after cutting the Venae Cavae and Aorta of a Frog, that a watery &s;olution of Opium poured into the Heart, occa&s;ioned, in a few minutes, con|vul&s;ions in its Legs; and, after cutting out the Heart, that the Opium poured into the Cavity of the Abdomen affect|ed the Legs in like manner; although, in the&s;e Experi|ments, the Circulation was not only interrupted, but the greater part of the Blood evacuated.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE then concluded<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edin. Phy&s;. E&s;&s;. publi&s;hed in 1771, p. 363.</NOTE>, and now conclude, that Opium and other Poi&s;ons, even after they are mixed with the Ma&s;s of Blood, produce their fatal effects, chiefly and almo&s;t &s;olely, by acting on the Nerves of the Heart and Va&s;cular Sy&s;tem, and, through the&s;e, affecting the whole of the Nervous Sy&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTS MADE ON ANIMALS WITH METALLINE SUBSTANCES.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to &s;tate the &s;everal circum&s;tan|ces I have ob&s;erved, in my Experiments, which more directly lead us to judge of the Nature and Cau&s;e of Animal Electricity.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN two Plates of different Metalline Sub&s;tances, particularly of Zinc and Gold, between which a living Frog is placed, are brought into contact with each other, tho&s;e Mu&s;cles, which are farther from the Brain and Spinal Mar|row than the Metals, are convul&s;ed: and this effect follows, although the Animal and Metals are placed on an inverted gla&s;s jar, and that a &s;tick of &s;ealing wax is interpo&s;ed be|tween the hand of the Operator and the Metals; that is, although the Animal, with the Metals, be in&s;ulated.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<P>I HAVE further ob&s;erved, that the Metals, di&s;po&s;ed as above de&s;cribed, excite convul&s;ions in the Legs, after all the parts of the Frog have been divided tran&s;ver&s;ely at the Pelvis, providing only that they are, thereafter, laid in contact with each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN all the parts of a living Frog, except the large Nerves called Sciatic, are cut tran&s;ver&s;ely at the Pelvis, and the fore part of the Animal is laid on a plate of Zinc, &s;upported by gla&s;s, and the hind Legs on gla&s;s; if a gold Probe be applied &s;o as to touch the Zinc and one of the Legs; or a piece of Metal put under one of the Legs; the Mu&s;cles of both Legs will be convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE event is the &s;ame, after the Body of the Frog has been cut tran&s;ver&s;ely about the middle of the Spine: or when the Legs are laid on the Zinc and the Spine on Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>IF a piece of perforated dry Paper is placed between the gold Probe and the Mu&s;cles, there will be no convul&s;ions; but wet Paper interpo&s;ed does not prevent the convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>ON &s;eparating the gold Probe from the Mu&s;cles there are no convul&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="17">
<P N="3">3. IF, after the Animal and Metals are placed as above de&s;cribed, the joining of the two Legs at the O&s;&s;a Pubis is cut, that Leg only will be convul&s;ed with which the gold is in contact.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Spine of the Frog with the Zinc being placed on one gla&s;s, and the Legs on another gla&s;s, if the gold, &s;up|ported by one hand, which we &s;hall call the Right Hand, be applied to the Zinc alone, and not to the Legs, the&s;e are not convul&s;ed. But if the Operator applies his left hand to the Legs, or if a by&s;tander, communicating with the Operator by the medium of the floor only, touches them, they are convul&s;ed. If a &s;tick of &s;ealing-wax be interpo&s;ed between his right hand and the gold, or between his left hand and the Legs; or, if the by&s;tander, touching the Legs, is in&s;ulated, by &s;tanding on a &s;tool &s;upported by gla&s;s feet, the Legs will not be convul&s;ed. If the in&s;u|lated by&s;tander touches the Legs with one hand, and the Operator with his other hand, the Legs are immediately convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. AFTER cutting the Spine tran&s;ver&s;ely under the fifth Vertebra, and all the parts of the Pelvis, except the Sciatic Nerves, and laying the Spine on Zinc &s;upported by gla&s;s,
<PB N="20" REF="18">and the Legs on gla&s;s; if gold be applied to the Zinc, and then to one of the Sciatic Nerves, both Legs, if they have not been &s;eparated from each other at the O&s;&s;a Pubis, will be convul&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Very &s;mall portions of different metals, applied as above de&s;cribed, have a&s;toni&s;hing effects; and although I have found that large portions of the metals produced convul&s;ions, when &s;maller had failed, or that they produced &s;tronger convul&s;ions; yet the effects are by no means proportioned to the weight of the metals employed, nor to the extent of their &s;urfaces which are &s;uddenly brought into contact. In mo&s;t of my Experiments, I employed a plate of Zinc, about five inches long, three inches broad, and about one-third of an inch thick; and a gold Probe, &s;omewhat thicker and longer than the Probes Surgeons commonly u&s;e.</NOTE>. And this happens although a &s;tick of &s;eal|ing-wax be interpo&s;ed between the hand of the Operator and the gold Probe, and although no Metalline Sub&s;tance touches the Legs.</P>
<P>THIS Experiment &s;ucceeds after denuding the Sciatic Nerves for the length of an inch, and wiping them dry; and it continues to &s;ucceed for an hour or more, and till the Nerves are evidently di&s;coloured and &s;hrunk in their &s;ize. And, after that, although we wet the Nerves, their powers are not re&s;tored; &s;hewing that the influence had been conveyed not by wetne&s;s on the &s;urface of the Nerves,
<PB N="21" REF="19">but by the particular matter of which Nerves are com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE event is the &s;ame, when the upper ends of the Scia|tic Nerves are cut away from the Spine, and laid on the Zinc.</P>
<P N="6">6. AFTER preparing the Frog and placing the Metals as in la&s;t Experiment, if a piece of thin dry Paper, pierced with a number of &s;mall holes, be interpo&s;ed between the gold Probe and the Sciatic Nerves, the Legs will not be convul&s;ed. But, if the Paper be wetted, although it is not perforated, the Legs will be convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>AFTER preparing a Frog, as in la&s;t Experiment, and lay|ing the Spine on one gla&s;s, and the Legs on another, if the Zinc be laid on a third gla&s;s, and the gold Probe applied to it and to the Sciatic Nerves, the Legs will not be convul|&s;ed.</P>
<P N="8">8. IF the Spine and hind Legs, connected by the Sciatic Nerves, are all laid on the &s;ame plate of Zinc, &s;upported by gla&s;s, the Legs are not convul&s;ed on touching the Zinc
<PB N="22" REF="20">with the gold Probe held in the right hand, although the left hand is applied to the Legs.</P>
<P N="9">9. IF &s;everal Frogs, prepared as above de&s;cribed, are laid upon gla&s;s, in a &s;traight line touching each other, and that the fir&s;t Frog is &s;upported on Zinc, and the la&s;t upon Gold; if one end of a bra&s;s wire is applied to the Zinc, and the other end of it to the Gold; the Mu&s;cles of all the Frogs will be convul&s;ed. The event is the &s;ame, although a &s;tick of &s;ealing-wax be interpo&s;ed between the hand of the Operator and the bra&s;s wire: that is, although the Frog with the Metals be in&s;ulated.</P>
<P N="10">10. WHEN Frogs are prepared as in la&s;t Experiment, and the Spine of the fir&s;t of them laid on Zinc, and the la&s;t &s;up|ported by the left hand of the Operator, if with a gold Probe, held in his right hand, he touches the Zinc, the Mu&s;cles of all the Frogs will be convul&s;ed. But if the hind Legs, as well as the Spine, of the fir&s;t Frog be laid on the Zinc, the Mu&s;cles of that Frog will not be convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="11">11. AFTER a Frog was prepared as before de&s;cribed, I cut the Sciatic Nerves where they are about to enter the Thighs, and laid their cut ends in contact with the Mu&s;cles,
<PB N="23" REF="21">and then touched the Zinc and Nerves with a gold Probe, without exciting convul&s;ions in the Thighs or Legs.</P>
<P N="12">12. AFTER cutting the Sciatic Nerves, I tied together their divided parts, and then touched the Zinc and Nerves above the Ligature, with the Gold, without finding that the Legs were convul&s;ed, when the Zinc &s;upporting the Spine was laid on one gla&s;s and the Legs on another: but when the Metals and parts of the Frog were laid on a wet Table, the Mu&s;cles of the Leg were convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="13">13. WHEN the Sciatic Nerves have been cut and rejoin|ed by Ligature, if while the Gold is, with one hand, ap|plied to the Zinc and Nerves, above the Ligature, the other hand touches the Feet, the Legs are convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="14">14. IF the two hind Legs of a Frog are &s;eparated from each other, and their Sciatic Nerves afterwards tied to each other; if one of the Legs be laid on Zinc &s;upported by gla&s;s, and the other Leg on gla&s;s, when, with one hand, the Toes of one of the Legs are touched, whil&s;t with the other hand a gold Probe is applied to the Zinc and Nerve of the Leg which it &s;upports, this Leg only will be convul|&s;ed. But if the gold Probe touching the Zinc be applied

<P N="15">15. I FOUND it was not nece&s;&s;ary, in order to excite convul&s;ions, that either of the Metals &s;hould be in contact with the living Nerve or living Fle&s;h of the Frog; for if, after &s;eparating from each other the hind Legs of a Frog, and cutting tran&s;ver&s;ely the upper part of their Sciatic Nerves, I laid a piece of putrid or boiled beef between their Sciatic Nerves, and two other pieces of putrid or boiled beef between their Toes and a plate of Zinc; if, with the point of a gold Probe, the &s;ide of which was ap|plied to the piece of beef placed between the Sciatic Nerves, I touched the Zinc, both Legs were convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="16">16. IN like manner, when I placed alternately, in a &s;traight line, a number of dead and living Frogs touching each other, and in the living Frogs cut, at their Pelvis, all the parts but the Sciatic Nerves; if, with my left hand I touched a dead Frog at one end of the line, and with a gold Probe, held in my right hand, I touched a plate of Zinc, on which a dead Frog was laid at the other end of the line or chain of Frogs, the Mu&s;cles of all the living Frogs were convul&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="23">
<P N="17">17. WHEN a chain of living and dead Frogs was formed, as in the two la&s;t Experiments, but without cutting at their Pelvis all the parts but the Nerves; on applying the gold to the Zinc, convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles were not excited.</P>
<P N="18">18. IT has been found, that, if a plate of Zinc is applied to the upper part of the point of the Tongue, and a plate of Silver to its under part, on bringing the two Metals in|to contact with each other, a pungent di&s;agreeable feeling, which it is difficult to de&s;cribe, is produced in the point of the Tongue. And if a plate of Zinc is placed between the upper lip and the gums, and a plate of gold applied to the upper or under part of the Tongue, on bringing the&s;e two Metals into contact with each other, the per&s;on imagines that he &s;ees a fla&s;h of lightning, which, however, a by|&s;tander in a dark room does not perceive; and the per&s;on performing the Experiment perceives the fla&s;h, though he is hoodwinked.</P>
<P>IT has been alleged, that the Fla&s;h happens before the two Metals touch each other, and is repeated on &s;eparating them; but the&s;e facts appear to me very doubtful, as I do not find that a Fla&s;h is produced when a piece of Cam|bric-paper, in which a number of holes is pierced with
<PB N="26" REF="24">a pin, is interpo&s;ed between the Zinc and Silver, although the Paper does not in thickne&s;s exceed 1/1500 part of an inch.</P>
<P>AFTER performing this Experiment repeatedly, I con|&s;tantly felt a pain in my upper jaw at the place to which the Zinc had been applied, which continued for an hour or more: And in one Experiment after I had applied a blunt Probe of Zinc to the Septum Narium, and repeatedly touched with it a Crown piece of Silver applied to the Tongue, and thereby produced the appearance of a Fla&s;h, &s;everal drops of Blood fell from that No&s;tril; and Dr FOWLER, after making &s;uch an Experiment on his Ears, ob&s;erved a &s;imilar effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr FOWLER's Book, p. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE farther ob&s;erved, that although the previous ap|plication of a &s;econd plate of Silver to one half of the plate of Zinc, does not prevent the Fla&s;h when the other half of the plate of Zinc, touching the Tongue, is brought into con|tact with the fir&s;t piece of Silver placed between the lip and the gum; yet if the Zinc and Silver are in the fir&s;t place applied to each other, then placed between the lip and
<PB N="27" REF="25">gum, and, after this, touched with the Tongue, there is no appearance of a Fla&s;h, although &s;ome degree of pungency and a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is perceived by the Tongue: and a mixed ma&s;s, compo&s;ed of one part of Zinc and two parts of Quick&s;ilver, or a ma&s;s compo&s;ed of three parts of Zinc and one of Silver, incorporated in a furnace, have not the effect, when they are applied to Nerves, of exciting convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles in which the Nerves terminate.</P>
<P>I HAVE al&s;o found, that two thick pieces of raw or boiled fle&s;h, one between the Zinc and Tongue, and the other be|tween the Silver and Tongue, do not prevent the di&s;|agreeable pungent &s;en&s;ation when the two Metals touch: and, in like manner, that the interpo&s;ition of two pieces of fle&s;h between the Zinc and Tongue, and between the Sil|ver and the upper Lip, does not prevent the appearance of a Fla&s;h, on bringing the two Metals into contact.</P>
<P N="19">19. I PUT a very thick plate of Zinc into a ve&s;&s;el with water, and placed, near to it, in the water, the under part of the Spine and the hind Legs of a Frog, after cutting all the parts at the Pelvis except the Sciatic Nerves. I then touched the Zinc with a gold Probe, and found, that, when I touched that part of the Zinc which was above the water,
<PB N="28" REF="26">the Legs of the Frog were not affected; but when I touch|ed that part of the Zinc which was below the &s;urface of the water, the Legs of the Frog were convul&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After reading to the Royal Society, on the 3d of June, an account of this Experiment, which I had made in the beginning of May, I found, from an in|genious publication of my Pupil Dr FOWLER, which I received that evening, that the &s;ame Experiment had been performed by him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NEXT put into the water one of the hind Legs of a dead Frog, and its other Leg into an adjoining ve&s;&s;el with water. Into the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;econd ve&s;&s;el, I put one of the hind Legs of a living Frog, in which all the parts at the Pelvis, except the Sciatic Nerves, were cut; and into a third gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el with water, I put its other Leg. When I now touched that part of the Zinc, which was below the &s;urface of the water with a gold Probe, the Legs were not convul&s;ed; but, if I, at the &s;ame time, dipped the finger of my other hand into the water contained in the third ve&s;&s;el, they were convul&s;ed: when, in&s;tead of my finger, I dipped into the water a &s;tick of &s;ealing-wax, held in my other hand, the Legs were not convul&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="27">
<P>I FOUND, by the three following Experiments, that the Mu&s;cles are convul&s;ed, whether the Influence, produced by the application of the Metals, pa&s;&s;es upwards or down|wards along the Nerves.</P>
<P N="20">20. I CUT four living Frogs tran&s;ver&s;ely at the middle part of their Spines, and threw away the fore parts of their Bodies and their Abdominal Vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>I NEXT cut, at their <HI>Pelves</HI> all the Parts but the Sciatic Nerves; and at their Knees, I cut all the Parts but the Crural Nerves; and, in all of them, I cut a&s;under the joining of the two hind Legs at their O&s;&s;a Pubis. I then laid the Legs of all of them in a &s;traight line, &s;up|ported on different Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;els inverted, in &s;uch a man|ner that the Foot of one Frog touched the Foot of the next to it.</P>
<P>HAVING then placed a Plate of Zinc under the Foot of the fir&s;t Frog, and holding in my left hand the Foot of the fourth or la&s;t Frog, I touched the Zinc with a gold Probe which I held in my right hand; and found that all the Mu&s;cles of the Loins, Thighs and Legs of the four Frogs were convul&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="28">
<P N="21">21. WHEN I placed the two Frogs in the middle, with their Spines contiguous to each other, and the Feet of both touching the Spines of the other two Frogs forming the Extremities of the Chain, and of cour&s;e the Feet of one of the&s;e re&s;ting on the Zinc, and the Feet of the other &s;up|ported by my left hand: On touching the Zinc with the gold Probe held in my right hand, all the Mu&s;cles of the Frogs were, as before, convul&s;ed.</P>
<P N="22">22. WHEN I now turned a&s;ide the right Legs of all the Frogs, &s;o that they did not form a Chain by touching the next Frogs; the right Legs were not convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that in whatever direction we &s;uppo&s;e the influence to have pa&s;&s;ed in its Circle, it mu&s;t, in Experi|ment 20th, have pa&s;&s;ed up one Leg and down the other in the &s;ame Frog: And, in Experiment 21&s;t, if it pa&s;&s;ed from one end of the Chain to the other end of it, it mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed upwards in two of the Frogs, and downwards in the other two; or if the influence pa&s;&s;ed from the two ends of the Chain towards its middle, where the Spines of the two middlemo&s;t Frogs were contiguous, it mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed upwards in all of them.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="29">
<P N="23">23. WHEN after cutting four living Frogs tran&s;ver&s;ely at the middle of their Spines, but without cutting at their Pelves all the Parts but the Sciatic Nerves, I placed the hind Parts of them in a Chain, as in Experiments 20th, 21&s;t and 22d, the Mu&s;cles were not convul&s;ed on applying the Gold to the Zinc.</P>
<P>I NEXT found, that after placing in contact with each other the &s;everal Mu&s;cles which had been cut tran&s;ver&s;ely in Experiments 20th, 21&s;t and 22d, allowing the Nerves to remain undivided, the mu&s;cles were not convul&s;ed when I touched the Plate of Zinc with the gold Probe held in my right hand, although I touched the other end of the Chain of Frogs with my left hand.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why the Mu&s;cles were convul&s;ed in Experi|ments 20th, 21&s;t and 22d, and not in Experiment 23d, evi|dently is, that in the former, the influence was concentra|ted in the Nerve, in the latter the influence was di&s;&s;u&s;ed; that is, was in part conveyed by other Organs, as well as by the Trunks of the Nerves.</P>
<P N="24">24. AFTER finding that I could readily excite Convul|&s;ions in the hind Legs of a Frog, without cutting it, by
<PB N="32" REF="30">laying its Back on a Plate of Zinc, and introducing a gold Probe within its Inte&s;tinum Rectum and touching the Zinc with the &s;ide of the Probe, I produced two or three hundred Convul&s;ions, &s;ucceeding each other quickly, and ob&s;erved that its Legs were, by the&s;e means, &s;o much weakened, that it could not jump, and crawled with diffi|culty, but in a few minutes it recovered nearly the full force of its Mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>IN other Frogs I pa&s;&s;ed a gold Wire between their Sci|atic Nerves and Os Sacrum, and twi&s;ted together the two ends of the Wire over the Backs of the Animals. I then put them into a Zinc Ve&s;&s;el filled with Water, or into a Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;el filled with Water, in the bottom of which I laid a large Plate of Zinc: So that every time the Ani|mals by moving &s;eparated the Gold from the Zinc, and again brought them into contact, their hind Legs were convul&s;ed. I allowed them to remain three or four days in this &s;ituation, and found that their Limbs were weak|ened con&s;iderably, but not exhau&s;ted of their Power of Motion; and, after removing the gold Wire, the Limbs by degrees recovered their &s;trength.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="31">
<P>I MADE the &s;ame Experiment on tho&s;e Frogs in which I had, &s;ix weeks before, cut out, from behind, all that part of their Spinal Marrow which is covered by the &s;ix under|mo&s;t Vertebrae, and found, &s;everal days after the Frogs had been &s;ubjected to the Experiment, that, by pinching their Sciatic and Femoral Nerves, and &s;till more readily by the application of the Gold and Zinc, weak convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles were excited.</P>
<P N="25">25. AFTER Frogs were prepared as above de&s;cribed, by cutting their Spines tran&s;ver&s;ely, and then all the parts of their Pelves, except their Sciatic Nerves, I found that &s;light Electrical Shocks, or a Leyden Phial di&s;charged directly through the Limbs of a Frog, or indirectly by the medium of water, produced convul&s;ions in their Mu&s;cles, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e excited by the Metals. And when, after moderate Electrical Shocks had been pa&s;&s;ed repeatedly through their Legs, the Metals were applied to their Nerves, in the manner before mentioned, the Mu&s;cles were convul&s;ed. I found, likewi&s;e, that after cutting the Nerves tran&s;ver&s;ely, and tying them together, Electrical Shocks were conducted by the Nerves, and occa&s;ioned convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="32">
<P>WHEN I had killed Frogs, by di&s;charging through them, from their foreheads to their hind feet, large Leyden Phials highly charged, I found their Nerves or Mu&s;cles, or both, &s;o much deranged, that feeble convul&s;ions only could be excited by pinching the Nerves, or by applying the Me|tals to them.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="33">
<HEAD>SUMMARY OF FACTS PROVED BY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>ON reviewing the foregoing Experiments, we &s;hall find the following Facts fully proved.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. ON forming a Circle by means of the parts of a living Animal and of two different metallic Bodies, e&s;pecially Gold and Zinc, in contact with each other, if a Nerve makes part of the Circle, the Mu&s;cles in which the Nerve terminates are convul&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ALTHOUGH the Nerve making part of &s;uch a Circle has been cut tran&s;ver&s;ely, yet, if the divided parts of the Nerve are laid in contact with each other, or tied together, the Mu&s;cles, in which it naturally terminates, are convul|&s;ed.</ITEM>
<PB N="36" REF="34">
<ITEM>3. IF the Metals, compo&s;ing parts of the Circle, are kept &s;teadily in contact with each other, the convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles cea&s;e. But, if they are &s;eparated from each other and again rejoined, the convul&s;ions are repeated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THE effects are the &s;ame, although the dead parts of an Animal or pure water make parts of the Circle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. ALTHOUGH the dead parts of an Animal, making part of &s;uch a Circle, are in contact with the Metals, the effects are the &s;ame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. A MUSCLE making part of &s;uch a Circle may be con|vul&s;ed whil&s;t the matter put in motion is pa&s;&s;ing in the di|rection from the Mu&s;cle to the Nerve.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. THE Mu&s;cle may be convul&s;ed although it makes no part of the Circle in which the matter put in motion pa&s;&s;es, as appears from comparing Experiment 5th with Experi|ments 13th and 14th. From Experiment 13th, it appears, that the Fluid put in Motion by the Metals pa&s;&s;es readily along a Nerve, after it has been cut, providing the divided Parts of it are brought into contact with each other. Yet in Experiment 14th, in which the left hand of the Opera|tor
<PB N="37" REF="35">was not applied to the Foot of the Frog, the Mu&s;cles in which the Nerve, lower than the Ligature, terminated, were not convul&s;ed, becau&s;e the Fluid put in motion did not de|&s;cend lower than the place at which the gold Probe touch|ed the Nerve above the Ligature. We may therefore pre|&s;ume that when a Nerve which has not been cut, as in Ex|periment 5th, is touched with the gold Probe, the Fluid put in motion does not pa&s;s lower in the Nerve than the place of the Probe. Hence we perceive the error of tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e that the moi&s;ture on the &s;urface of the Nerve conducts the Fluid put in motion to the Mu&s;cles, and that their action is in con&s;equence of the direct operation of this Fluid upon their Fibres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. THE effects are the &s;ame when the Animal and the Metals are in&s;ulated, by being placed on Gla&s;s, whil&s;t Seal|ing-wax is interpo&s;ed between the hand of the Operator and the Metals.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. IF any part of the Circle is compo&s;ed of Sealing-wax or Gla&s;s, the Mu&s;cles are not convul&s;ed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. CONVULSIONS are not excited unle&s;s the Metals are in contact with each other; and unle&s;s both Metals are al&s;o in contact with the Animal Sub&s;tances or the Water making part of the Circle.</ITEM>

<HEAD>RESEMBLANCE OF THE FLUID PUT IN MOTION BY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS TO THE ELECTRI|CAL FLUID.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fluid &s;et in motion by the application of the Metals to each other, and to Animal Bodies or to Water, agrees with or re&s;embles the Electrical Fluid in the following re|&s;pects.</P>
<P>LIKE the Electrical Fluid, it communicates the &s;en&s;e of pungency to the Tongue.</P>
<P>LIKE the Electrical Fluid, it is conveyed readily by Wa|ter, Blood, the Bodies of Animals, the Metals; and is ar|re&s;ted in its cour&s;e by Gla&s;s, Sealing-Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT pa&s;&s;es, with &s;imilar rapidity, through the Bodies of Animals.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="37">
<P>LIKE the Electrical Fluid, it excites the activity of the Ve&s;&s;els of a living Animal, as the Pain it gives and Hemor|rhagy it produces &s;eem to prove. Hence perhaps it might be employed with advantage in Amenorrhoea.</P>
<P>IT excites Convul&s;ions of the Mu&s;cles in the &s;ame man|ner, and with the &s;ame effects as Electricity.</P>
<P>WHEN the Metals and Animal are kept &s;teadily in con|tact with each other, the Convul&s;ions cea&s;e, or an Equili|brium &s;eems to be produced, as after di&s;charging a Leyden Phial.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="experiment">
<PB N="40" REF="38">
<HEAD>THE NERVOUS FLUID OR ENERGY NOT THE SAME WITH THE ELECTRICAL NOR WITH THE FLUID PUT IN MOTION BY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Nervous Fluid is the &s;ame with the Electrical, or with the Fluid which is put in motion by the foregoing Experiments, is, I apprehend, di&s;proved by the following circum&s;tances.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WITHOUT &s;tating the difficulty there is in conceiving how the Electrical Fluid can be accumulated by or con|fined within our Nervous Sy&s;tem, we may ob&s;erve that where the Electrical Fluid, or Fluid re&s;embling that put in motion by the foregoing Experiments, is accumulated by an Animal, &s;uch as the Torpedo or Gymnotus, a proper apparatus is given to the Animal, by means of which it is enabled to collect and to di&s;charge this Fluid.</ITEM>
<PB N="41" REF="39">
<ITEM>2. THE Nervous Power is excited by chemical or by me|chanical Stimuli; and, on the other hand, is de&s;troyed by Opium and other Poi&s;ons, which cannot be imagined to act on the Electrical Fluid.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I HAVE, I apprehend, refuted the theory of Doctors GALVANI, VALLI and others, which &s;uppo&s;es that the Nerve is electrified <HI>plus</HI> and the Mu&s;cle <HI>minus,</HI> re&s;embling the Leyden Phial, by &s;hewing that the Mu&s;cles are convul|&s;ed where there is no communication between them and the Metals, but by the medium of the Nerve; or when the Me|tals are applied to different parts of the Nerve alone, with|out touching the Mu&s;cles which are convul&s;ed, and when the Mu&s;cle which is convul&s;ed makes no part of the Circle in which the Matter that is put in motion pa&s;&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. I HAVE proved, that the Mu&s;cles are convul&s;ed whil&s;t the current of the Electrical Matter is pa&s;&s;ing from them and from the &s;maller Branches of the Nerves into their Trunks; and as a Mu&s;cle is never thrown into Action by the Nervous Energy, except when this pa&s;&s;es from the Trunk of the Nerve into its Branches, and from the&s;e into the Mu&s;cle, it appears that when, in the&s;e Experiments, the Mu&s;cles were convul&s;ed, the Nervous and the Electrical
<PB N="42" REF="40">Fluids were moving in oppo&s;ite Directions; from which we may infer, that, in their Nature, they differ e&s;&s;entially from each other.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THE Nervous Energy is &s;topped by a tight Ligature or by the tran&s;ver&s;e Inci&s;ion of a Nerve, although its di|vided Parts are thereafter placed in contact with each o|ther; whereas the Electrical Fluid or the Fluid excited by the Metals, pa&s;&s;es readily, downwards or upwards, along a Nerve which has been tied or cut.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. AFTER the Limb of a living Animal has been amputa|ted, frequent Convul&s;ions of the &s;ame Mu&s;cles may be ex|cited by applying Mechanical or Chemical Stimuli to its Nerves; whereas Electrical Matter di&s;charges it&s;elf &s;uddenly.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HENCE I conclude,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the Fluid, which, on the application of Metal|line Bodies to Animals, occa&s;ions Convul&s;ions of their Mu&s;|cles, is electrical, or re&s;embles greatly the Electrical Fluid.</ITEM>
<PB N="43" REF="41">
<ITEM>2. THAT this Fluid does not operate directly on the Mu&s;cular Fibres, but merely by the Medium of their Nerves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT this Fluid and the Nervous Fluid or Energy are not the &s;ame, but differ e&s;&s;entially in their Nature.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT this Fluid acts merely as a Stimulus to the Nervous Fluid or Energy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THAT the&s;e Experiments have merely &s;hown a new mode of exciting the Nervous Fluid or Energy, without throwing any farther or direct Light on the nature of this Fluid or Energy.</ITEM>
