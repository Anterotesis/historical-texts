<HEAD>I. <HI>The Practice of Purging and Vomiting Medicines, according to Dr.</HI> Cockburn<HI>'s Solution of his Pro|blem; with Tables &s;hewing their Do&s;es in particu|lar Ages and Con&s;titutions. In&s;crib'd to the Learned Dr.</HI> Garth, <HI>F. R. S. by</HI> W. Cockburn, M. D.</HEAD>
<P>BY my Solution of the Problem for determining the due Do&s;es of Purging and Vomiting Medicines,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Phil. Tran&s;|act. No.</HI> 303.</NOTE> in all their Ca&s;es, it is manife&s;t in general,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Po&s;tul.</NOTE> that the&s;e Medi|cines operate either upon the account of their being mix|ed with the Blood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schol.</NOTE> or by their &s;timulating the Stomach and Guts: 2. That this their Operation is more or le&s;s according to the Quantity and Thickne&s;s of Blood, <HI>h.e.</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cor.</HI> 1.</NOTE> a greater Quantity, and the thicke&s;t Blood require the greate&s;t Do&s;es: And 3,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prop.</HI> 1.</NOTE> that when the Quantities of Blood are the &s;ame, the Do&s;es of Purging and Vomiting Medicines are in a duplicate proportion of the Bloods thickne&s;s. As al&s;o, that in every ca&s;e the&s;e Do&s;es mu&s;t be in a proportion compounded of the Quantity of Blood and tho&s;e Squares of its thickne&s;s.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prop.</HI> 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now &s;ince the Operations of Purgative and Vomitive Medicines depend &s;o much on the Quantity and Vi&s;cidity of the Blood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Do|&s;es of the&s;e Medicines &s;o hard to be found.</NOTE> which have not been duely con&s;ider'd be|fore; it is no wonder that the Practice of Phy&s;ick in the&s;e Evacuations has been &s;o uncertain, and that the mo&s;t ex|pert Phy&s;icians, from their mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;ervations, could never determine the true Do&s;es of Medicines, which alter &s;o much according to the various Subjects they work upon; they not being acquainted with the true Method of determining either the quantity of the Blood, or the degrees of its thickne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>Becau&s;e Experience is equally the Foundation and Touch&s;tone of all rea&s;oning in Phy&s;ick, we will here &s;ub|mit our Solution to common Ob&s;ervations, and try whe|ther every thing propo&s;ed in it, does not exactly an&s;wer Matters of Fact, and the vi&s;ible Operations of Na|ture.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The different effects of the&s;e Medicines upon the ac|count of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> it plainly follows, that the&s;e Medicines al|ways purge be&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;tantly in a liquid form; becau&s;e they are more ea&s;ily convey'd into the Blood, and can &s;timulate more parts, and that upon the account of this their Fluidity; whatever may be the way that Purges and Vomits work, or what&s;oever their Nature may be. This explains very ea&s;ily a very common Ob|&s;ervation, hitherto very difficult to Phy&s;icians, about the different Operation of the &s;ame Medicine in different forms: Why, <HI>viz.</HI> the Infu&s;ion of a due quantity of a Purging Medicine produces its effects &s;ooner and more con&s;tantly than a like quantity of the &s;ame Medicine in a Powder, tho' &s;till more con&s;tantly in a Powder than a Bolus, tho' &s;till &s;ooner and more con&s;tantly in a dry Bo|lus, than if it be given in Pills made into that form with Gums that do not purge; and this difference in Purging &s;hall even be notable, according to the di&s;&s;olubility of the Gums.</P>
<P>From whence it follows, that the Evacuation made by &s;uch Medicines, is in proportion to the quantity of tho&s;e Medicines that happens to be di&s;&s;olv'd, and not to the quantity admini&s;ter'd.</P>
<P>Secondly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their effects different, be|cau&s;e of the different thickne&s;s of Blood.</NOTE> That purging by Draughts is the mo&s;t ex|cellent form, and will always have the mo&s;t con&s;tant effect.</P>
<P>The next Con&s;ideration is, that a certain quantity of any purging Medicine affects us after a different manner, according to the different Quantity and Con&s;titution of the Blood, or its thickne&s;s, and it was &s;hewn in the So|lution, that if its thickne&s;s were the &s;ame, the Do&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="4">&s;hould always be as its Quantity, but the Blood differing likewi&s;e in thickne&s;s, the Do&s;es of Purging and Vomiting Medicines mu&s;t be augmented on account of its thickne&s;s. This is perfectly well confirm'd by daily experience; where we find, that People &s;ick with a manife&s;t thick|ne&s;s of Blood, as in Drop&s;ies, the Jaundice, &amp;c. take far greater Do&s;es than they did at any other time when they were not &s;ick, or in that manner.</P>
<P>By a further Di&s;qui&s;ition into this matter, we find that the Do&s;es mu&s;t not only be greater where the thickne&s;s of Blood is greater; but that they mu&s;t be encreas'd in a duplicate proportion of their Vi&s;cidity. This is evident by the Tables in <HI>Ca&s;&s;ia. viz.</HI> 9:83::4:3&dram;, 1 &scruple;, 13&frac13; <HI>gr.</HI> and therefore <HI>alternando</HI> 9:4::8 &dram;:3 &dram;, 1 &scruple;, 13 &frac13; <HI>gr.</HI> Therefore the Do&s;es are as the Squares of the Con&s;titutions. So likewi&s;e 9:8 &dram;::16:14 &dram;, 13 &frac13; <HI>gr.</HI> and <HI>alternando</HI> 9:16::8 &dram;:14 &dram;, 13 &frac13; <HI>gr. h. e.</HI> the Do&s;es are as the Squares of the Con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is true in any other Con&s;titution be&s;ides the mean: For Example, in the lowe&s;t and highe&s;t 4:16:: 213 &frac13; <HI>gr:</HI> 853 &frac13;. So that by this means we are not only led directly to a right u&s;e of the&s;e Medicines, and are able to find the true cau&s;e why the ordinary Do&s;es produce &s;o very different effects in different Con&s;titutions; but like|wi&s;e,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Problem.</NOTE> <HI>The Quantity of Blood in any Per&s;on being given together with the ordinary and extraordinary effect of a Do&s;e of a Purging Medicine, the Change of that Per&s;ons Con&s;titution, and the Nature of that Change may be deter|min'd.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be a great &s;atisfaction to the mind to find a Doctrine founded on a few &s;imple Experiences leading us into the cau&s;e of many more that are very complext,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Doctrine true becau&s;e conform to Nature.</NOTE> difficult, and ob&s;cure; which is &s;ufficient to prove its conformity to Nature. But my pre&s;ent endeavour being to rectify the common Practice of the&s;e Medicines by this Doctrine, I &s;hall frame, by this Method, Tables of the
<PB N="4" REF="5">Purging and Vomiting Medicines in pre&s;ent u&s;e; better adapted to Experience than are hitherto to be found.</P>
<P>The Method of framing &s;uch Tables,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they are made.</NOTE> is by &s;etting off the practicable Con&s;titutions in the different Ages that I have ob&s;erv'd to take notable Quantities of Purging and Vomiting Medicines; &s;o that by comparing the&s;e Con&s;ti|tutions with the Ages, we have the different Do&s;es in all tho&s;e ca&s;es, which is all that is requir'd for a better pra|ctice; tho' a more proper occa&s;ion may produce a more nice and exact divi&s;ion of Con&s;titutions, very much to the advantage of the Practice of Phy&s;ick in all Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Ages wherein the&s;e different Do&s;es are taken, I find to be four; when a Man is about 16 or 20 Years of Age, and weighs about 12 Stone, he then takes the com|mon Do&s;e: One of nine Years takes three quarters of that; one of &s;ix the half, and one of three Years a quarter. Moreover,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> p.</HI> 51. <HI>Bibli|oth.

That of the mo&s;t fluid Blood as the fir&s;t number, and &s;o on; in that ca&s;e, the Do&s;e of any Per&s;on will be found by multiplying the common Do&s;e for his Age into the Square of his Con&s;titution and dividing by the Square of the middle Con&s;titution. For in&s;tance, If &ounce;j. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ioe</HI> is the common Do&s;e, or the Do&s;e of the middle Con&s;titution, &dram;iij. &scruple;j. and <HI>gr.</HI> 13 &frac13; is the Do&s;e of the fir&s;t Con&s;titution, and &dram;xiv. <HI>gr.</HI> 13 &frac13; that of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t or la&s;t Con&s;titution; and &s;o proportionably for every Medicine in all the Ages, as appears by the Tables.</P>
<P>This Method &s;eems to an&s;wer &s;o exactly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only excep|tion.</NOTE> that there is not any thing nece&s;&s;ary be&s;ides, except a Per&s;on is more Loo&s;e or Co&s;tive than ordinary (which may be known from the Patient or otherways) it is to be reputed the &s;ame, as if he had taken an equivalent quantity of a Me|dicine proper to produce the&s;e effects. Any Phy&s;ician,
<PB N="5" REF="6">who has con&s;ider'd this ca&s;e in &s;ome People after Flux|ing, will allow the ju&s;tne&s;s of this Exception.</P>
<P>As Vomiting Medicines have the &s;ame common Do&s;es with tho&s;e that Purge,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Do&s;es of Vomiting Medicines.</NOTE> they admit al&s;o of the like divi|ded Do&s;es; which, therefore may be found by the &s;ame Tables. Only, as People that are more Co&s;tive than or|dinary require a proportionable greater Do&s;e of a Purg|ing Medicine: So they require their Do&s;e of a Vomiting Medicine to be con&s;iderably le&s;s, as is very very well known in hot Countries.</P>

<HEAD>The TABLES. <HI>Some In&s;tances &s;hewing the Defects of the pre&s;ent Practice, and how mended by the foregoing Tables.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Do&s;es of the foregoing Tables, ari&s;ing from Cal|culation, agree perfectly well with the common Ob&s;erva|tion of the be&s;t Authors; tho' their Ob&s;ervation is very general and ill made, if we except the very fir&s;t Steps. For in&s;tance, Authors of all Countries, <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Authors Co|py, but do not Ob&s;erve.</NOTE> German, Italian</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> reckon the Do&s;es after the &s;ame manner; whereas, if they had been ob&s;erv'd, they mu&s;t have been different as are the Con&s;titutions of Men in the different Countries.</P>
<P N="2">II. The defect of their Ob&s;ervation is manife&s;t by the di&s;proportion'd Do&s;es of &s;ome Medicines, their high Do|&s;es being &s;ometimes double and &s;ometimes triple, and
<PB N="6" REF="7">more of their low Do&s;es, which is not conform to Na|ture; for, let the low Do&s;e be what it will, the high Do&s;e of one Medicine mu&s;t always bear the &s;ame proportion to the high Do&s;e of another, as did their low Do&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> even in Manna, they reckon it from &ounce;j: commonly to &ounce;iij. and &ounce;iv. If it is &s;aid that the fir&s;t Do&s;e is the lowe&s;t Do&s;e that is taken by a Man of a due Age, it is neither true in fact nor conform to their own way of reckoning: For in&s;tance, Rhubarb is &s;aid to be taken from &dram;j. to &dram;ij. No body will &s;ay that this is the lowe&s;t Do&s;e taken by a Man of a due Age as formerly; becau&s;e it is not in fact true, nor that the high natural Do&s;e is &ounce;<HI>&s;s;</HI> for, as I &s;aid be|fore, if &ounce;j. of Manna and &dram;j, of Rhubarb are the re&s;pe|ctive low Do&s;es, then &ounce;iv and &dram;ij. cannot be the re&s;pective high Do&s;es. As to what concerns &s;ome extraordinary Do&s;es given by them&s;elves, and far exceeding the ordina|ry Do&s;e, is ea&s;ily accounted for by the Solution. There are many Examples of this Nature: Turbith, <HI>viz.</HI> is com|monly reckon'd among them from &dram;j. to &dram;ij; yet <HI>Marg|gravius,</HI> and good Authors, have given it to &dram;iv. So <HI>Co|locynthis</HI> from <HI>gr.</HI> vi. to <HI>gr.</HI> xij. and <HI>Fulgin. Fernel. Dun|can.</HI> &s;ay they have given it to &dram;&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. <NOTE PLACE="marg">They have only given the Do&s;es for Men at full Age.</NOTE> Authors have been far from being exact; for they have only dos'd the&s;e Medicines for People of full Age; but have left the Do&s;es of the different Ages in &s;ilence; nor have they told us at what time a Man takes his high|e&s;t Do&s;e, or how that alters in the Growth and Decline of Age, which is &s;till a very great difficulty for the mo&s;t experienc'd Phy&s;icians to manage.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their way of determining Do&s;es fal&s;e.</NOTE> Their general Method is founded in a Mi&s;take; their lowe&s;t Do&s;e being really the common Do&s;e taken by the generality of Men, which produces a multitude of Errours in the Practice. This is manife&s;t in their do|&s;ing every Medicine.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P N="5">V. <NOTE PLACE="marg">This &s;hewn particularly.</NOTE> The mentioned Ca&s;e is more manife&s;t by the&s;e Ta|bles, and it is two to one but that a Phy&s;ician over Pur|ges or under Purges any Per&s;on in Health; and if more Ca&s;es in Sickne&s;s are &s;uppos'd, the odds will encrea&s;e pro|portionably. Experience confirms this exactly: For if the middle Do&s;e is given to one of the lowe&s;t Con&s;titu|tion, and the middle Do&s;e is to purge 7 or 8 times; in that ca&s;e, the Per&s;on of the lowe&s;t Con&s;titution is purg'd near twice as much as he ought to be; and if given to one of the highe&s;t Con|&s;titution, he is purg'd but half of what he &s;hould be. But if the Do&s;e of the highe&s;t Con|&s;titution is given to one of the middle Con&s;titution, he is purg'd twice as much as he ought to be; and if given to one of the lowe&s;t, he is purg'd four times as much, or about thirty times, as we find true by daily Experience. But if the Quantity of Blood, the Age, or Sickne&s;s con|tribute to the Errour, it may prove fatal. If this Con&s;i|deration were illu&s;trated by a proper number of Exam|ples, we &s;hould find &s;ome hundreds of, otherways una|voidable, Mi&s;takes now prevented by the Practice of the&s;e Tables.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, We may ea&s;ily account, by the&s;e Tables,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Tables &s;hew how the Do&s;es of Chil|dren may o|ver purge People of full Age.</NOTE> for the Do&s;es of Children over purging &s;ome People of good Health, and of due Age; a <HI>Phaenomenen</HI> &s;o &s;urprizing, that the &s;mallne&s;s of the Do&s;e is commonly thought a good Excu&s;e for the Mi&s;take.</P>
