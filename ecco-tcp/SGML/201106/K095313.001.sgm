<P>THE out-lines of the following &s;tory, and &s;ome of the incidents and more minute circum&s;tances, are to be found in the antient Engli&s;h hi&s;torians. If too great liberties have been taken in altering or enlarging their accounts, the reader who looks only for amu&s;ement will probably forgive it: the learned and critical (if this work &s;hould be honoured by &s;uch readers) will deem it a matter of too lit|tle con&s;equence to call for the &s;everity of their cen&s;ure.&mdash;It is generally ex|pected that pieces of this kind &s;hould con|vey &s;ome u&s;eful moral: which moral, not always perhaps the mo&s;t valuable or re|fined, is &s;ometimes made to float on the &s;urface of the narrative; or is plucked up at proper intervals, and pre&s;ented to the view of the reader, with great &s;olemnity. But the author of the&s;e &s;heets hath too high an opinion of the judgment and pe|netration of his readers, to pur&s;ue this
<PB REF="3">method. Although he cannot pretend to be very <HI>deep,</HI> yet he hopes he is <HI>clear.</HI> And if any thing lies at bottom, worth the pick|ing up, it will be di&s;covered without his direction.</P>

<P>WHEN HENRY, the third of that name, reigned in England, Sir RANDOLPH, a va|liant knight of Cornwal, now too old to take a part in the affairs and commotions of the realm, retired to the peaceful enjoyment of tho&s;e honours and fortunes, which he had purcha&s;ed by a &s;eries of hardy &s;ervices in the field. The eve of his life was engaged in the plea&s;ing occupation of training up two youths his &s;ons who were ri&s;ing fa&s;t to maturity: in teaching them the &s;acred duties which they owed to heaven and to their country, in&s;piring them with a gallant love of arms, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their minds with undaunted courage duly tempered with benevolence and humanity.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on was genial, the evening &s;erene and re|fre&s;hing; when Randolph wandered forth, with a youth attending him on each &s;ide, eagerly li&s;tening to his narrative of wars and glorious dangers. The boys pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly on, with their eyes and thoughts fixed on their father, 'till they were in&s;en&s;ibly led to the brow of a chalky cliff, commanding a wide and uninterrupted view of the calm unruffled &s;ea, that now reflected all the rich and glowing crim&s;on of the &s;etting &s;un. Here they &s;at down, and urgently en|treated their father to renew the &s;tory of his dangers
<PB N="6" REF="5">in the Holy Land, the atchievements of the brave &s;oldiers of the cro&s;s; the recent wars in France, and the valour of Earl Richard and his Knights; while the attention of Randolph was fixed on a &s;mall barque, now approaching to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Its keel cut &s;wiftly and deeply into the &s;ands, and a general &s;hout from the ve&s;&s;el rou&s;ed the little com|pany, who&s;e attention was &s;till farther awakened, when they ob&s;erved the deportment of the man who fir&s;t leaped on &s;hore. His garb was that of an hum|ble pilgrim, who&s;e holy vows were leading him to &s;ome &s;cene of devotion; and by his &s;ide hung a large and trenchant weapon befitting the &s;on of honourable war, rather than the votary of religion; his look was pale and &s;qualid; but his port erect; and a &s;ecret greatne&s;s and manly dignity &s;eemed to break through all the gloom of adver&s;ity which &s;urrounded him. No &s;ooner had he touched the &s;trand, than he &s;tood for a moment, as it were, in a &s;till and motionle&s;s &s;ur|prize; then &s;alling on his knees, with arms cro&s;&s;ed, and eyes rai&s;ed up to heaven, his looks expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t rapturous gratitude and thankfulne&s;s, as if for a deliverance from &s;ome great calamity; whil&s;t &s;ome others of the crew, with all appearances of tender re|gard, conveyed a young and beauti&s;ul per&s;onage to &s;hore, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame habit with their leader. The whole &s;cene was extraordinary and affecting: the youths had de&s;cried it, and &s;tarting up, and turn|ing to their father, &s;eemed to demand the rea&s;on of this appearance. <Q>Come, my &s;ons, cried Randolph, this &s;tranger appears unfortunate; perhaps he may accept of our ho&s;pitable reception; let our friendly offices not to be wanting, to allay his grief, and to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities.</Q> Thus &s;aying, he led them by a winding de&s;cent towards the &s;hore, where the crew were by this time di&s;embarqued.</P>
<P>Sir Randolph approached the &s;tranger, (to whom the re&s;t of the company &s;eemed to pay a particular re|gard) with a concern truly humane: when, in&s;tantly, the eyes of each were fixed in mute &s;urprize upon the other.&mdash;'My General!'&mdash;'My Knight!' Their
<PB N="7" REF="6">tongues could utter no more: they ru&s;hed into each other's arms, and clung together in a tumultuous di&s;|order of grief, amazement, and affection. At length, words forced their pa&s;&s;age. <Q>Great Earl! cried Randolph, and do I really behold thee? Do I em|brace the man, under who&s;e command my la&s;t days of honourable war &s;aw glory and victory? Hath my leader &s;urvived the dreadful night of tempe&s;t which di&s;per&s;ed our &s;hips! He whom we imagined buried in the &s;eas! Is he at length returned in &s;afety? But why this garb? Are the&s;e wretched weeds be|fitting the &s;on of an illu&s;trious monarch, the con|queror of Ga&s;coigne, the glory of England? Thou art come, but not to peace and repo&s;e: danger, difficulty, and di&s;tre&s;s, are &s;till prepared for that undaunted &s;pirit!'&mdash;Am I not in England?" replied the &s;tranger. 'Have I not at length, happily ef|caped the in&s;idious attempts of my enemies? What dangers have I now to fear! No, my deare&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">! illu&s;trious dame! tendere&s;t wife! In thy arms &s;hall I now forget my dangers. To thee I fly, to wipe away tho&s;e tears, which bur&s;t for that my departure, and mu&s;t have flowed in full &s;treams, during this melancholy interval of my ab&s;ence. In thee and thy endearments &s;hall all my future hopes be centered: and never, no, never more &s;hall WILLIAM be de|luded by the &s;miling promi&s;es of glory, to hazard the chance of arms! Enough hath been already done: enough hath been given to honour and to my country. Peace and retirement, repo&s;e and tran|quillity be now the lot of the&s;e &s;hattered limbs, and this di&s;tracted, wearied &s;pirit!</Q></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Earl thus indulged his flattering pro|&s;pects of tranquillity, the thoughts of Randolph were bu&s;y and di&s;ordered; he &s;urveyed him with a mixture of pity and affection; and half &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;igh that laboured in his brea&s;t, he a&s;&s;umed a look of ea&s;e and complacency, and invited Lord William and his atten|dants to partake of the refre&s;hment which his neigh|bouring re&s;idence afforded. They pa&s;&s;ed on with the plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations of men, who after a length of days
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;pent in a foreign and unfriendly land, began once more to ta&s;te the comforts of a native country, and to &s;hare in the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of kin&s;men and fellow citizens. Their leader turned to the youthful pilgrim, whom he embraced with a tender and affectionate concern; but with &s;uch joy as &s;eemed clouded by the remembrance of pa&s;t calamities. They retired a few paces as if in private conference, and the elder &s;eemed intent in comforting and encouraging. The courteous Knight would not break in upon their private conference, and to leave them the more free to indulge that mutual af|fection which they di&s;covered, he turned to his youths: 'Behold,' &s;aid he, <Q>this truly honourable Lord, great in de&s;cent, powerful in arms; full of the mighty &s;pirit of his royal father the &s;econd Henry, a monarch fatally &s;educed by the beauty of Ro&s;amond: and (mark the ju&s;t di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven) heavy was the puni&s;hment which the mother paid, for her forbid|den love: nor hath misfortune &s;pared this the off|&s;pring of an unlawful and unhappy pa&s;&s;ion. Yet let us be ju&s;t to his virtues; and learn from him, that renown is not to be purcha&s;ed but by toil and perils. Under his banners hath your father oftentimes en|countered dangers. With him did I ha&s;ten to &s;up|port the cau&s;e and title of our King, when John had met his fate, and the &s;on of France rioted in the calamities of England. With him did the&s;e old arms contribute to execute the vengeance of our country upon the adherents of the perfidious Lewis; and when the Count Mal-leon revolted from his liege lord, and erected the &s;tandard of France in our pro|vince of Ga&s;coigne, then did he bravely &s;econd the efforts of Richard, uncle to our Prince, and led us on to victory. A&s;pire to the &s;ame renown: but ex|pect the like fortune: dream not of undi&s;turbed hap|pine&s;s and tranquillity. By expecting labour and di|&s;tre&s;s, you &s;hall learn to encounter, and to conquer them, in a glorious and hone&s;t cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far paternal tenderne&s;s diverted the attention of Randolph from his illu&s;trious friend, who in this &s;hort interval had been equally engaged. He embra|ced
<PB N="9" REF="8">his followers, congratulated their happy arrival, and zealou&s;ly extolled their merits and faithful &s;ervices. The Knight, with all due courte&s;y, led them on to|wards his ho&s;pitable hall, which &s;oon opened to their view, and &s;oon received the wearied gue&s;ts. No friend|ly care was wanting to recal their languid and droop|ing &s;pirits. As men ju&s;t &s;natched from the dread gulph of mi&s;ery, and &s;uddenly re&s;tored to a degree of happi|ne&s;s beyond the hopes and even the conceptions of their dejected thoughts, they gazed each upon his fel|low in a &s;ilent extacy of &s;urpri&s;e and joy; and &s;till more endeared to each other, as &s;harers in the &s;ame misfortunes, their eyes, their hands encountered &s;pon|taneou&s;ly, and they embraced with an affecting cordi|ality and plea&s;ure. Earl William, who now began to re&s;ume his native dignity, his eyes, as it were newly lightened up, his voice le&s;s plaintive, his a&s;pect grea|ter, and his port &s;till more princely, earne&s;tly &s;eized the hand of that young per&s;onage, to whom he &s;eem|ed more particularly attentive, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his ho&s;t. <Q>O, my friend, here is our dear|e&s;t charge. Know, and re&s;pect this beautiful maid, for &s;uch &s;he is, the daughter of a brave and hone&s;t &s;oldier. His name Les Roches, and once mine ene|my: but furtune and his virtues united us in bands of friend&s;hip, truly &s;acred and inviolable. It is by his goodne&s;s that I now &s;ee my native land. His gene|rous pity &s;aved me when the arm of mine enemy was ju&s;t rai&s;ed to &s;trike, to &s;trike me ba&s;ely, and trea|cherou&s;ly, unknowing, un&s;u&s;pecting, and unprovid|ed for defence.</Q> 'Welcome, Lady,' replied the Knight; <Q>alas! the&s;e limbs were not formed for toil or dangerous adventure. But where is thy gallant father? My heart pants to embrace him; an En|gli&s;h heart, which holds a &s;oldier dear, of whatever clime or country: and doubly dear, and doubly honoured, &s;hall that &s;oldier be, who re&s;tores a noble and beloved &s;on to England.</Q> Here grief threatned to break through the fair re&s;erve of female mode&s;ty; and had already fallen in gentle drops, down her glow|ing cheeks; which the Earl perceiving, checked with a kindly reproving look; then &s;oftly entreated Ran|dolph
<PB N="10" REF="9">to &s;ummon &s;uch of his dome&s;tics as might be pro|per to conduct her to refre&s;hment and repo&s;e. The&s;e in&s;tantly appeared, and were in&s;tructed to perform their offices with all tender and re&s;pectful care. The maid retired in &s;ilence: Randolph &s;eemed wrapt in delight and wonder, whil&s;t the Earl pur&s;ued her parting &s;teps with looks of &s;weete&s;t complacency and pity. The Knight then turning to the followers of this Lord, 'My friends,' &s;aid he, <Q>your toils demand retire|ment: this roof knows no other happine&s;s than to greet the approach of worth and valour. It is your's, and u&s;e it freely. For this night, at lea&s;t, forget your labours, and indulge your faint and ha|ra&s;&s;ed limbs in peaceful re&s;t.</Q>&mdash;'Yes,' &s;aid the Earl, <Q>to re&s;t, my dear companions; but bear, with my impatience, and be &s;tirring with the dawn; that we may i&s;&s;ue forth with new-recruited &s;peed, and quick|ly gain my ca&s;tle. There &s;hall our labours end; there &s;hall the gentle Counte&s;s acknowledge your de|&s;erts; and there &s;hall her long lo&s;t Lord reward your fidelity.&mdash;Sir Randolph, you too &s;hall accompany us, and &s;hare the general joy. We &s;hall teach you to receive your fellow &s;oldier with a more lively &s;ympathy, and brighten that hone&s;t a&s;pect with gayer &s;miles.</Q></P>
<P>To this gentle reproof, which &s;eemed to have e&s;cap|ed unwarily from the jealou&s;y of friend&s;hip, Randolph made no reply; but with a countenance of &s;trict compo|&s;ure, which effectually concealed whatever thoughts or pa&s;&s;ions were now bu&s;y in his mind, he invited Lord William to retire. 'No, my friend,' replied the Earl,&mdash; <Q>my followers are happily di&s;po&s;ed of: at la&s;t (thanks to the pre&s;erving hand of heaven, and to thee) they enjoy that &s;ecure repo&s;e, to which they have been &s;o long &s;trangers. I feel my heart ea&s;ed of its op|pre&s;&s;ing load. Nor will I give the&s;e eyes to &s;leep, 'till I have heard&mdash;Say, what of my wife, what of my friends, of the King and realm, can my good ho&s;t impart?&mdash;But chiefly of my wife; of Ela I would hear all thou can&s;t deliver; how hath &s;he borne this tedious ab&s;ence? Knowe&s;t thou not of
<PB N="11" REF="10">her pre&s;ent &s;tate? Speak! alas, the grief of my widowed dame &s;eems to affect that good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. But &s;ay, is &s;he well.</Q>&mdash;Randolph had betrayed &s;ome agitation at the&s;e enquities; but quickly recollecting his di&s;ordered thoughts, <Q>Her tenderne&s;s and love for thee have been approved, &s;aid he, in the ab&s;ence of her Lord: to-morrow thou &s;halt &s;ee her in her princely ca&s;tle. But now indulge my patience: &s;ay what means this garb? this appearance of misfor|tune? Who are the&s;e thy attendants?</Q>&mdash;'Yes,' &s;aid the Earl, <Q>I will tell thee all. Sit down,&mdash; Thou wilt not be di&s;plea&s;ed to hear the &s;tory of my misfortunes &s;ince our la&s;t dreadful &s;eparation.</Q> Ran|dolph obeyed, and the Earl thus began.</P>

<P><Q>HOW can I recal to mind the fatal time, when our victorious army, loaded with the &s;poils of Ga&s;coigne, reimbarked, and with hearts of joy and expectation, &s;teered towards their native &s;hore. Thou, Randolph, who had&s;t &s;hared the dangers of our war, who&s;e hoary head &s;till di&s;dained to droop beneath its beaver, mu&s;t retain the dreadful remem|brance of that night, when winds and &s;eas con&s;pired together, and united their unrelenting fury again&s;t the bands of England: when the roaring hurricane dea&s;ened us with its horrid menaces, and the frequent lightning &s;erved to di&s;clo&s;e all the terrors of the gloomy deep. Our army, that had undauntedly de|fied the &s;words of France, found now another ene|my, again&s;t who&s;e ob&s;tinate a&s;&s;aults their courage &s;eemed but ineffectual: and every moment pre&s;ent|ed us with the di&s;tracting expectation of peri&s;hing in di&s;honourable ob&s;curity. And much doth it rejoice me, that in that extremity of di&s;tre&s;s; the ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints were not unmindful of Randolph, that my gallant knight was happily re&s;cued from de&s;truction, to cheer his friends, and enjoy his latter days in peace and dignity. The fate of Sali&s;bury was more &s;evere and
<PB N="12" REF="11">affecting. The &s;hip which received me and my a&s;|&s;ociates was quickly &s;eparated from our fleet, a help|le&s;s and &s;olitary prey to the violence of the tempe&s;t, which our pilot had neither &s;kill nor &s;pirit to oppo&s;e. And in that dreadful moment, when, rai&s;ed to a gid|dy and terrible height, we hung upon the breaking wave, or &s;unk down deep into the dark and yawning gulph, then was my dear heart's trea&s;ure, my belov|ed dame, pre&s;ent to my di&s;tracted mind: to die was horrible; becau&s;e to die was to be torn from Ela. Her &s;orrows crowded upon my bu&s;y fancy; and I &s;unk; O, my friend, how can I &s;peak it! I funk into a coward.&mdash;Doth that tear now &s;tealing down your furrowed cheek expre&s;s your pity of my weak|ne&s;s, or a &s;en&s;e of my misfortunes?</Q>&mdash;The di&s;or|der of the good knight, which could no longer be en|tirely concealed, here &s;u&s;pended the narration. Lord William &s;eized his hand with a look of &s;urprize and concern at his &s;en&s;ibility: but Randolph prevented all expo&s;tulation, by a &s;udden and violent effort to re&s;ume his &s;erenity. He &s;oon recalled his thoughts to a com|po&s;ed attention, and at his de&s;ire the Earl proceeded.</P>
<P><Q>Heaven was at length plea&s;ed in &s;ome degree to controul the violence of the &s;torm. The dawn of morning &s;eemed to promi&s;e us at lea&s;t &s;ome re&s;pite from de&s;truction: yet &s;till, helple&s;s and de&s;ponding, without cour&s;e or direction, we to&s;&s;ed as the winds and tides impelled: and when at la&s;t we de&s;cried land, that cheering object to wretches who have &s;up|ported an unequal conte&s;t with the raging tempe&s;t, only &s;erved to in&s;pire us with new fears, le&s;t it &s;hould prove the land of our enemy. But alas! it was de|creed (and the &s;hocking &s;cene &s;till dwells on my ima|gination in all its horror) that far the greater part of us &s;hould never touch the &s;hore which lay in view. We &s;teered upon a coa&s;t utterly unknown: the rock which lay in ambu&s;h to de&s;troy us, a&s;&s;ailed our ve&s;&s;el; the waves ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly through the breach. In that dreadful moment, when hope vani&s;hed, when Death &s;tood with open arms to receive his prey, the magnanimity of my dear unhappy companions&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="12">how &s;hall I &s;peak it! They clung round my knees with tears of &s;ollicitude and zeal for my pre&s;ervation. They entreated, they pre&s;&s;ed, they forced me to &s;eek for &s;afety in the boat, which it was their la&s;t care to make ready for their beloved captain, with ten more the mo&s;t eminent in command. Re&s;olute and undi&s;|mayed even in the very moment of their de&s;truction, they hailed our departure and triumphed in our &s;afe|ty. I hear their &s;houts! they &s;till &s;trike my ears.&mdash; O England! can the world boa&s;t &s;uch &s;ons?&mdash;The deep clo&s;ed over them, and &s;natched the dear, afflicting, awe&s;ul object for ever from our eyes. We rowed away in &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment, full of the terrible idea, and little cheered by the pro&s;pect of land, which we dreaded to find un|friendly. Nor were our fears mi&s;taken; for when our la&s;t and utmo&s;t efforts had been exerted to gain the &s;hore, &s;ome wretched fi&s;hermen who had at fir&s;t gazed in expectation on our ve&s;&s;el, and at the &s;ight of armed men, &s;led precipitately into the country, ap|peared by their garb and language to be French, and convinced us that the pro&s;pect of immediate de&s;truction, was only changed for another no le&s;s dreadful, that of an hard and tedious captivity: that of falling into the hands of men whom we had but now defied and vanqui&s;hed; and being made the vic|tims of revenge for blood &s;till reeking upon our blades.</Q></P>
<Q><P>We moored our boat, uncertain what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue, whether to &s;eek refuge from our enemies in an unknown and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, or by advancing forward to re&s;ign our&s;elves into their power. It was, however, &s;oon re&s;olved boldly to meet our danger. We moved on &s;lowly and circum&s;pect; the &s;un play|ed upon our armour, and its reflected beams &s;erved as a direction to a &s;mall armed band that had been alarmed by their countrymen, and now marched forth to &s;eek their invaders. My companions, little di&s;|mayed at &s;uch a &s;uperiority of numbers as they had frequently repelled, un&s;heathed their &s;words, now their only weapons, and &s;tood, as men re&s;olved to
<PB N="14" REF="13">defend their lives and liberty to the utmo&s;t. The undaunted &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance per&s;uaded our enemies that &s;ome ho&s;tile de&s;ign was meditated, and that greater numbers were approaching to our &s;upport. They halted and &s;urveyed us; their bowmen di&s;|charged their &s;hafts; and three of my unhappy friends lay bleeding upon the earth, pouring out their lives without a po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or the con&s;olation of a brave revenge. Our enemies, ani|mated by their &s;ucce&s;s, ru&s;hed upon us; they felt our blades; but &s;oon taught us that re&s;i&s;tance was ineffectual. They &s;urrounded my friends, and impa|tient to &s;ecure their captives, hurried them precipi|tately acro&s;s the plain; but in their blind unguided fury, left me at &s;ome di&s;tance &s;ingly engaged with their commander, who with couched lance, &s;purred forward, and loudly called upon me to yield my&s;elf his pri&s;oner, or meet my fate. Active and experi|enced in arms, I evaded his on&s;et, and with this good &s;word (who&s;e length and keenne&s;s had long been the terror of his countrymen) I aimed a blow, which was received by his fiery charger. The bea&s;t grew furious with angui&s;h, and impatient of com|mand &s;oon ca&s;t his rider at my feet. But I, who neither inclined, nor deemed it prudent to pur&s;ue the work of death; ever ready to &s;pare a pro&s;trate foe, and nothing di&s;po&s;ed to provoke a &s;evere vengeance on my companions; lifted my beaver, and with looks of courte&s;y rai&s;ed the leader from the ground. I pre|pared to acco&s;t him, when, &s;tarting back, as if un|able to &s;upport &s;ome &s;udden and violent &s;urprize; he &s;tood &s;peechle&s;s and motionle&s;s, ca&s;ting his eyes to heaven, and fixing them on me by turns. Ble&s;&s;ed Saints!&mdash;O noble Lord!&mdash;thus did he exclaim; Twice my pre&s;erver! How &s;hall Les Roches repay thy exalted goodne&s;s? In the i&s;le of Rh&egrave;! and thus attended! But fly this moment; I mu&s;t rejoin my friends. That path is &s;afe: it leads thee to a place of concealment: expect me &s;oon; and expect &s;ome return of gratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
With the&s;e words, the &s;tranger (for &s;uch he &s;till &s;eemed to me) turned ha&s;tily away, in pur&s;uit of his troop, now leading off their pri&s;oners in triumph. Nor could I &s;uddenly recover from my amazement. Mine eyes &s;till attended him, and marked his ha&s;ty &s;teps, until he was lo&s;t in the di&s;tant crowd. Then &s;uddenly recollecting mine own danger, and his friendly coun&s;el, I took the path to which he had pointed, and mea&s;ured out the tedious way with limbs wearied and faint, and with a mind no le&s;s hara&s;&s;ed by tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions. Still confounded and per|plexed, my thoughts &s;ought in vain for that &s;ecurity, that concealment which the &s;tranger had promi&s;ed; when turning mine eyes eagerly on every &s;ide in &s;earch of &s;ome cheering object, they at length di&s;co|vered at &s;ome di&s;tance a large and venerable pile. It's windows crowded with the foliage of their orna|ments, and dimmed by the hand of the painter; it's numerous &s;pires towering above the roof, and the chri&s;tian en&s;ign on it's front, declared it a re&s;idence of devotion and charity. Hither I determined to bend my cour&s;e, and to &s;ix here, my la&s;t and only hopes of refuge. War had long taught me to &s;up|port toil and ab&s;tinence. But, alas! my &s;pirit now denied it's wonted a&s;&s;i&s;tance to my exhau&s;ted &s;trength, and when my limbs had laboured up the eminence on which this man&s;ion &s;tood, with &s;low and painful ef|forts; when a few paces only remained to bring me to the entrance, nature could &s;truggle no farther; my &s;ight grew clouded, I fell, as in the arms of death, and fainted under the &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ion of fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s. Nor did my mi&s;erable &s;tate e&s;cape the regards of charity; for when my languid eyes again opened to the light, I found my&s;elf attended by one who &s;eemed an inhabitant; and from him learned that I lays before the portal of an antient Abbey, where the brethren of the Ci&s;tertian order, employed their peaceful hours in ori&s;ons to heaven, and acts of humanity to their fellow creatures. The friendly door was laid open for my reception: the arm which had rai&s;ed me from the ground, with the &s;ame hu|mane
<PB N="16" REF="15">concern &s;upported my tottering &s;teps, and led me through the winding i&s;les, to a retired cham|ber; where the charitable offices of my attendant were bu&s;ily employed to provide whatever might be needful for re&s;t and refre&s;hment, whatever might recal the &s;trength and comfort the afflicted &s;pirit of a wretched &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I felt the kind effects of his pious care; and though &s;tili anxious and oppre&s;&s;ed, yet reiieved from the extremity of languor, and con&s;cious of returning &s;trength, I reque&s;ted to be conducted to the reverend Abbot; who in that in&s;tant prevented me, and enter|ed, to enquire into the occa&s;ion of my arrival, and to know what further offices might be granted to a man, who&s;e appearance and di&s;tre&s;s had by this time engaged the attention of the whole fraternity. With the authority of a &s;uperior, he directed my conductor to withdraw, and for a while &s;urveyed me with a kind yet piercing eye. His a&s;pect, from which the beams of piety and charity &s;eemed to break forth in a mild and cheering light, commanded reverence and love. I made the due obey&s;ance, and entreated his kind protection for a man who had drunk deeply of afflic|tion, who &s;tood before him a monument of the tre|mendous di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven, torn, perhaps, for ever, from all that he held dear, ca&s;t on a foreign &s;hore, without guide, friend, or refuge: yet, &s;ome|time, no &s;tranger to happier days. 'Son,' replied the venerable father, the&s;e gates are never barred again&s;t the afflicted: but far be all pollution from our walls! War hath been thy occupation: but hath that &s;word been ever &s;tained with the blood of a friend or brother? Hath no great offence odious to religion or humanity, cut thee off from &s;ociety; and driven thee away a wretched and abandoned wan|derer? Impatient of &s;u&s;picion, I fell upon my knees before him, and in&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to &s;hrift, opened my whole &s;oul freely, as in the face of hea|ven, declared my country, my name and quality, and di&s;tinctly recounted my late unhappy fortunes. The good father heard me with exact attention; he|&s;itating
<PB N="17" REF="16">and &s;truggling with the ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, he ut|tered &s;ome words of comfort, while the big tear rol|led down: nor did this mark of generous pity di&s;|grace his venerable a&s;pect; although he laboured to conceal it, when he was to urge the precepts of fortitude and patience.' 'My &s;on! &s;aid he (now re&s;uming a look of ea&s;e and compo&s;ed dignity) 'Nature obliges us to feel, but Religion forbids us to repine. That power which deals out misfortune to &s;inful mortals, will, in his own appointed time, accept of their penitence, and wipe away their tears. Thou art the enemy of my country, but thou art a man. This roof &s;hall not reject thee: retire and re&s;t &s;e|curely: the duties of my office call me: with to|morrow's ri&s;ing &s;un I will revi&s;it thee.' He de|parted; and deprived me of that momentary com|fort, which his looks and voice in&s;pired.</P>
<P>The couch now received me, but not to repo&s;e. My bu&s;y thoughts, too long and too violently agita|ted to &s;ub&s;ide into &s;erenity and quiet, revolved the dreadful &s;cenes in which I had been ju&s;t now en|gaged: &s;ometimes were they fixed on the fate of my companions; now, on my own danger: and ever and anon di&s;tracted me with the recollection of my country, my family, and (O killing torment!) my wife. But I was not long permitted to indulge the&s;e &s;ad reflections. A rude knocking at the gates echo|ed through the arched i&s;les, and rou&s;ed me from my gloomy dreams. Suddenly it cea&s;ed. Silence, &s;till more alarming, and anxious expectation &s;ucceeded. I &s;tarted up, and gra&s;ped my &s;word as it were in|&s;tinctively. I heard the &s;eet of ha&s;te approaching my chamber. The door opened, and there &s;tood before me the Frenchman, who&s;e life I had that day &s;pared: and whom I now recognized rather by his voice, than by the glimmering lamp depending from the cieling. Have I found my pre&s;erver? (thus did he earne&s;tly acco&s;t me) well did I divine that he would find refuge with my reverend kin&s;man: and that I &s;hould &s;till be able to repay the goodne&s;s of Lord William.'&mdash;'Thou knowe&s;t me, &s;aid I, ha&s;|tily
<PB N="18" REF="17">interrupting him; twice, I think, thou &s;aid it, twice I had pre&s;erved thee. All this is &s;trange, and would be unfolded.' 'Recal to mind, replied the Frenchman, that bu&s;y day, when the gallant Earl of Marche was forced to yield before the Engli&s;h bands led by duke Richard and by thee. The impetuous Mal-leon, he, who&s;e envy of thy &s;uperior worth and greatne&s;s had fir&s;t prompted to revolt from En|gland, he who hated thy name, and fickened at the report of thy valour, loudly defied and challenged thee: ye engaged, hor&s;e to hor&s;e, with the furious rage of rivals; and &s;oon the &s;uperior prowe&s;s of Sali&s;bury prevailed.' 'I well remember it, &s;aid I; and when the Count was &s;inking to the ground, a va|liant &s;oldier ru&s;hed forward to his re&s;cue; and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to all the fury of his victorious enemies.' 'I was that &s;oldier, cried he: mine own men &s;hrunk cowardly from me, the Engli&s;h &s;urrounded me, and when their &s;words were rai&s;ed to de&s;troy me; then did Lord William with difficuity repre&s;s their violence, and I became his pri&s;oner.'&mdash;Hereupon I interrupted him.&mdash;'A pri&s;oner! then were my intentions not duly executed. That fidelity and valour which prompted the brave &s;oldier to defy the terrors of death in order to pre&s;erve his friend, de&s;erved more re&s;pect and bet|ter fortune. My orders were that he &s;hould be freed and honourably conducted to his own camp without delay or ran&s;om.' 'And the&s;e orders were obeyed, &s;aid he; I was freed, I was honourably conducted to my own camp without delay or ran&s;om: and there did I loudly proclaim thy worth. The li&s;tening &s;ol|diers hung on me with rapture whil&s;t I told the deed: and enemies were taught to revere the magnanimity and generous humanity of England and of Sali&s;bury. O fatal zeal of gratitude! The Count Mal-leon, who&s;e imperious &s;pirit could but ill endure the pier|cing wound his honour had now received; di&s;com|fitted, di&s;graced, and doubly conquered, now felt the mo&s;t malignant pa&s;&s;ions rankling in his brea&s;t: tor|tured by the prai&s;es of the conqueror, he breathed revenge and fury; thundered out the &s;evere&s;t and
<PB N="19" REF="18">mo&s;t tremendous menaces again&s;t him&s;elf, the world, but above all again&s;t Lord William. O! would to heaven that this extravagance of rage and malice had even now &s;ub&s;ided!' Here the good Frenchman &s;eemed in no &s;mall emotion, rai&s;ed, as I then con|ceived, by the ardour of gratitude and indignation at the ungenerous conduct of his countryman. I endeavoured to divert him to &s;ome other &s;ubject, by di&s;covering an unwillingne&s;s of hearing my own commendations, and by &s;peaking of the malice of my enemy with &s;light and &s;corn.' 'Alas, &s;aid he, thou knowe&s;t not half thy danger. In this i&s;land on which thou ha&s;t been ca&s;t naked and defencele&s;s, Count Savour&egrave; de Mal-leon bears an ab&s;olute com|mand. If he &s;hould di&s;cover thee (which heaven forbid!) what fortunate event could &s;ave thy life? or if &s;pared, what ran&s;om could purcha&s;e thy liberty? I am indeed his officer, but all my cares and &s;ervices mu&s;t be devoted to my pre&s;erver. Thy remaining friends I have &s;een di&s;po&s;ed, with &s;uch advantage as their pre&s;ent &s;tate allows. Their ran&s;om &s;hall be my work! but O, my heart bleeds for their noble lea|der! I cho&s;e this &s;ilent hour, when darkne&s;s might conceal me from the eye of &s;u&s;picion, to come and warn thee of thy danger. Let the&s;e holy walls &s;till conceal thee: nor dare to brave the arm of revenge and malice. I mu&s;t retire: thy friends &s;hall be my care: and may heaven direct me to &s;ome means of &s;peedily removing thee from this accur&s;ed place!' 'I &s;eized the hand of the generous Les Roches, and attempted to expre&s;s my acknowledgements of his humane and noble friend&s;hip: but he ha&s;tily broke from me with a tender and affecting prayer for my pre&s;ervation; and left me full of wonder and per|plexity.</P></Q>

<P>THE lingering hours of night at length pa&s;&s;ed away, and the Matin-bell &s;ummoned the re|verend fraternity to their early devotions. Their pious cares for me were now renewed, their charita|ble offices repeated, to oblige and comfort me. The hoary Abbot returned to chear me with his pre&s;ence, and his gho&s;tly coun&s;el. I was witne&s;s of the com|forts of religion and tranquillity. Happine&s;s &s;eem|ed to me the native re&s;ident of the cloi&s;ter; and my repining heart murmured again&s;t heaven, that had marked me out for the &s;torm and turbulence of life. Another day was &s;pent, and another night pa&s;&s;ed away more tranquil and refre&s;hing: and I ro&s;e with my thoughts fixed on the kind Les Roches, and in anxious impatience for his return. The day advan|ced, but my friend &s;till delayed his coming At length the charitable Abbot appeared, not with a front of placid &s;erenity, but gloomy and contracted, full of anxiety and grief, which like the infectious bla&s;t that at once de&s;troys the fruits of nature, filled my &s;oul in&s;tantly with I knew not what dreadful and ominous pre&s;age.' 'Unhappy &s;on! &s;aid he; Mal|leon has di&s;covered, if not the place of thy con|cealment, at lea&s;t that thou art concealed in this i&s;land: thanks to the indi&s;cretion of &s;ome of thy countrymen which di&s;clo&s;ed the name of their com|mander. His jealou&s;y points to Les Roches as the author of thy e&s;cape: vengeance is denounced a|gain&s;t him; and this moment the good Les Roches lies in the damp dungeon.' 'For me! &s;aid I: And is charity &s;o great a crime? Is tyranny &s;uffered to rage thus without controul in France? For me doth my kind pre&s;erver endure the pain of captivity?&mdash; With a look in which affection and authority were united, the father here repre&s;&s;ed my emotion. Son, &s;aid he, the time calls for calm and determined mea&s;ures. In this place thou can'&s;t not longer
<PB N="21" REF="20">abide. Thy coming was not &s;ecret, and &s;hould it reach Mal-leon, alas, I fear the impetuo&s;ity of that proud Count might drive him to violate the &s;acred privileges of our hou&s;e. Les Roches, though now unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee, is yet anxious &s;till for thy pre|&s;ervation. The pea&s;ant &s;ent by him to inform me of thy dangers, waits to conduct thee faithfully to the ve&s;&s;el prepared to convey thee to Rochelle. Thither thy ran&s;omed friends have already directed their cour&s;e; and from thence &s;ome fortunate event may conduct thee to thy native country. Tarry here, until the &s;hades of night may conceal thy departure. Then i&s;&s;ue forth: and may all good angels hold thee in their protection! Our prayers' &mdash;Here pity &s;topped his voice; and filled his eyes with tears; whil&s;t I in broken accents laboured to expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, my pity for the kind and injured Les Roches, and my indignation at the ba&s;ene&s;s of Mal-leon. He &s;aw my pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;order; he entreated, he exhorted, and he re|proved; till perceiving by my wandering and in|attention, that my mind was too bu&s;ily engaged to admit his &s;piritual coun&s;els, he retired and aban|doned me to my own reflections; and the&s;e were intirely confined to the misfortunes of the generous and kind Les Roches. I accu&s;ed my&s;elf as the &s;ole author of his &s;ufferings; and abhorred the mean de&s;ign of flying, when I had involved my friend in danger. What can the malice of Mal-leon inflict on me (it was thus I rea&s;oned) if to purcha&s;e the liberty of my pre&s;erver, I re&s;ign my&s;elf into his power? To kill me!&mdash;That were unnatural. The man I never injured cannot proceed to &s;uch an ex|travagance of calm unprovoked cruelty. Or if he could, my country could not long be unacquainted with my fate; and would (he mu&s;t be well a&s;&s;ured) di&s;charge all it's vengeance on my de&s;troyer. And &s;hall the fear of bearing the in&s;ult and triumph of my rival in arms, &s;hall the tediou&s;ne&s;s of captivity or the &s;everities of a pri&s;on, drive me from the man who &s;uffers for his goodne&s;s towards me? Shall I
<PB N="22" REF="21">&s;acrifice his freedom, perhaps his life, only to ha&s;ten my return to England.&mdash;The thought appeared odious and di&s;honourable. I in&s;tantly formed the darling re&s;olution of purcha&s;ing the freedom of Les Roches, by delivering my&s;elf into the hands of my enemy; and &s;pent the remaining hours of day in that &s;atisfaction and complacency which ari&s;e from the flattering ideas of &s;elf-applau&s;e. The &s;un de|clined; darkne&s;s gradually prevailed, and at length brought on the hour of my departure. And now, firmly and ob&s;tinately &s;ettled in my dangerous pur|po&s;e, I received the benediction of the reverend Ab|bot, with a countenance of fixed &s;erenity, which he, good man, commended, as an indication of my re|liance upon heaven. Touched with his goodne&s;s, I could not &s;uppre&s;s the tears that &s;tarted from me, and interrupted my grateful acknowledgements of his charitable care, and his zealous prayers for my pro|tection. Our hands were cla&s;ped in each other; our eyes rather than our tongues &s;poke the emotions of our brea&s;ts, until the father, who fir&s;t made the effort to repre&s;s his pa&s;&s;ion, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of my departure: and while he ardently commended me to every holy faint, I i&s;&s;ued forth under the di|rection of the pea&s;ant my conductor.</P>
<P>I had not departed many paces from the Abbey, when addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the guide, with a voice which be&s;poke a deliberate and determined re&s;olu|tion, I commanded him to conduct me to the pri&s;on where Les Roches lay confined. The poor man, who was no &s;tranger to my quality or to my ha|zardous &s;ituation, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t horror and a&s;toni&s;hment; and in language rude and unrefined, yet &s;uch as denoted an hone&s;t and a tender affection, attempted to remon&s;trate again&s;t &s;uch a perilous de|&s;ign. I &s;hewed him gold; but this had no effect. I then drew my &s;word, and threatened him with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of vengeance, unle&s;s he in&s;tantly obeyed my command. Terror &s;eemed to have a greater influence than entreaties or promi&s;es. He changed his cour&s;e and called on me to follow.
<PB N="23" REF="22">Thus directed, I eagerly took the path which I &s;uppo&s;ed would lead me to my friend; filled with the high thoughts of obtaining his freedom by a free re|&s;ignation of my own. But after long traver&s;ing the gloomy and tedious way, I found too late that either fear and darkne&s;s had mi&s;led my conductor, or that he had purpo&s;ely deceived my expectations; for when the dawn began to appear, we found our&s;elves &s;uddenly prevented from all farther progre&s;s by a deep and rapid current. The pea&s;ant trembled; but I had no power (however irritated) to puni&s;h his error, or his mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s. Exhau&s;ted as I was, with fatigue and inward agitation, my arm with difficulty took the ca&s;que from my forehead. I dip|ped it in the &s;tream, and drank deeply; then re&s;ign|ing my feeble limbs to the dank ground, in&s;en&s;ible of all danger, and indifferent to my fate, I funk into a profound &s;leep, nor did I awaken till the meridian fun &s;la&s;hed upon me with it's beams and rou&s;ed me by the full force of their heat and brightne&s;s. I called on the pea&s;ant; but he had deferted me. I aro&s;e, and wandered &s;lowly along the banks of the river, without purpo&s;e or direction: and &s;o freely did I indulge the wandering of my thoughts, &s;o far was I lo&s;t to recollection, that I never once perceived the found of approaching feet, till I was encompa&s;&s;ed by fix armed men, who proved, as I at once &s;uppo&s;ed, the guards of Count Mal-leon.&mdash;But, my friend, why &s;hould I abu&s;e thy indulgence, by this minute detail? Night &s;teals fa&s;t from us. Let me not for|get what thy age demands.' 'No,' replied Ran|dolph, 'think not of me; my &s;oul is all attention to the misfortunes of my leader. Ha&s;te and give to my impatience the &s;tory of thy deliverance, that I too, in my turn, may relate the things which de|mand thy &s;erious ear.'&mdash;The Earl then proceeded.</P>

<P>THE &s;oldiers required my name, my purpo&s;e, and de&s;tination: and as I had long &s;ince re|&s;igned all hopes of e&s;cape, I di&s;covered my&s;elf with|out re&s;erve or difficulty. Two of them were in&s;tant|ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a nod, and departed with the mo&s;t precipitate &s;peed. Whil&s;t the remaining number, with that courte&s;y and re&s;pect, which be&s;poke them the brave and generous &s;ons of honourable war, con|ducted me to a cottage that lay at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, fa&s;t by the margin of the current. Here I was trea|ted, not with imperious in&s;olence, the effects of ba&s;e and di&s;honourable enmity, but with all humane and kind regards due to a brave unfortunate. This en|couraged me to attempt &s;ome conference with my keepers; who, on their part, di&s;covered no reluc|tance to gratify their pri&s;oner. From them I learned that my guide had really mi&s;taken the way, and that I now lay within one hour's di&s;tance from the ca&s;tle of their Lord. I earne&s;tly enquired after the fate of Les Roches, and heard with a mixture of joy, and vexation at my own precipitate conduct, that on the preceding night, he had been relea&s;ed from his cap|tivity. When I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize and &s;atisfac|tion at this event, I was told that immediately after that the &s;urviving Engli&s;hmen had been ran&s;omed by the bounty of Les Roches, and &s;uffered, at his inter|ce&s;&s;ion, to depart; Count Savour&egrave; had received in|formation that one of them had ra&s;hly di&s;covered, that the Lord of Sali&s;bury, their leader, was &s;till in the i&s;le of Rh&egrave;! This in&s;tantly kindled up a flame of pa&s;&s;ion in his brea&s;t. He affected to regard the tale of their di&s;tre&s;s as vain and fictitious; and expre&s;&s;ed &s;trong apprehen&s;ions of a con&s;piracy formed by his enemies in concert with his officer to &s;eize the i&s;land. In this &s;udden and violent fit of rage, he had commanded Les Roches to pri&s;on, and ordered a&s;trict guard to watch round the coa&s;t. The French|man,
<PB N="25" REF="24">con&s;cious of his own innocence, exclaimed loudly again&s;t the &s;everity of his commander; men|tioned the incon&s;iderable number of the Engli&s;hmen that had appeared, and enlarged on the unrea&s;ona|ble nature of the Count's &s;u&s;picions. He demanded to know, if any man had dared to accu&s;e him; if he had an accu&s;er, he defied him to the li&s;ts, and of|fered to prove his fal&s;ehood and his own loyalty in &s;ingle combat. Yet with what re&s;erve &s;o ever the&s;e &s;oldiers &s;poke of their commander, I learned clearly that his remon&s;trances had not &s;o great an effect on Count Savour&egrave;, as the power and influence of Les Roches, who though he fought under his command, had him&s;elf a numerous and formidable body of feu|datory va&s;&s;als, that attended him in arms, and were attached to their Chief with an ardent and invari|able affection. It appeared plainly, that fear (for cruel natures are mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible to fear) had deter|mined the imperious Count to relea&s;e my friend, when the fir&s;t &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion of rage had &s;omewhat abated, and no appearance of danger had been di&s;|covered. My guards informed me &s;till farther, that on this very morning, Mal-leon had repented of his lenity; and that his apprehen&s;ions were again a|wakened, as he had received information, that on that part of the &s;hore which looks towards the main land of France, another ve&s;&s;el had been di&s;covered hovering about the i&s;land, with an appearance which fully warranted &s;u&s;picion. I readily concluded that this was no other than the ve&s;&s;el in which my ran&s;omed friends had embarked, and which &s;till lay off the &s;hore in hopes of receiving me. But without di&s;covering this, I contented my&s;elf with earne&s;tly di&s;avowing, in general, all intentions of an ho&s;tile nature; nor could I &s;peak of the mean fears and in|&s;olent &s;everity of Mal-leon but with a warm and pa&s;|&s;ionate indignation. But here our conference was interrupted by the arrival of another body, who came, as they &s;aid, to take charge of me, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the others from their attendance. I now ex|pected to be led in triumph to the pre&s;ence of my
<PB N="26" REF="25">enemy, but &s;oon learned that I was to continue for &s;ome time in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. At this I ven|tured to expre&s;s &s;ome &s;urprize. But the looks and words of &s;ullen gloom and moro&s;ene&s;s which the&s;e my new guards a&s;&s;umed, obliged me to &s;urpre&s;s all farther enquiries. I &s;ubmitted patiently to my fate. I was di&s;armed, and confined in the cottage under the care of two &s;oldiers, who &s;eemed to command the party, the re&s;t of which they had di&s;po&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance, in different &s;ituations, to watch all ap|proaches that might threaten re&s;cue.</P>
<P>Night advanced upon us, and I was left to my re|po&s;e: but what repo&s;e remained for a wretch to&s;&s;ed about thro' all the vici&s;&s;itudes of danger, toil, and di&s;tre&s;s, by the capricious cruelty of fortune? A thou&s;and thoughts and a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ions encoun|tered each other in my di&s;tracted brea&s;t. I threw my&s;elf upon my hard and homely couch; and &s;tarted up by turns; like the feveri&s;h wretch, ince&s;&s;antly changing, in fruitle&s;s &s;earch of ea&s;e. Nature &s;eemed to lower upon me, and to thunder terror into my af|frighted ears: the loud &s;torm and the roaring torrent broke in upon the &s;ilence of night, and made darkne&s;s doubly dreadful. How did I then accu&s;e the &s;low and indolent advances of time; that tortured me with cruel delay? Oftentimes did I endeavour to compo&s;e my troubled thoughts; and as often did the terrors of the night awaken my di&s;tractions. Watchful and di&s;ordered as I was, my &s;oul was &s;oon tortured with a new and terrible alarm. It was now the dead midnight hour: on that &s;ide where my chamber looked down upon the troubled river, I plainly heard my two guards in dreadful conference encouraging each other to the horrid purpo&s;e of murder.' 'It is now, &s;aid one, the very moment of execution; he &s;leeps: take you this dagger, and let us enter: when we have di&s;patched this Engli&s;hman, my orders are to plunge his body in the river, that it may be thought he has e&s;caped: ob&s;erve me well: and be a&s;&s;ured of the favour of our Count. The dagger is the la&s;t re&s;ource. No blood if po&s;&s;ible: our fir&s;t at|tempt

Is &s;uperior worth &s;o odious and in&s;upportable? Can envy prove &s;o bloody?'&mdash;'Oftentimes, &s;aid Lord William, have I &s;een death loading the fields of war with frightful carnage: and never did my &s;oul &s;hrink at his ap|proach: but now when he appeared in the form of a calm and deliberate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, I at once lo&s;t all firm|ne&s;s. The cold dew i&s;&s;ued from every pore; I com|mended my&s;elf to heaven; and lay entranced in di&s;may. A hideous interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;ucceeded, for the murderers had not yet appeared. The tor|ture of this delay was even wor&s;e than death. To this I had re&s;igned my&s;elf, or even wi&s;hed to receive it. Still I lay in &s;tupid expectation of the fatal me&s;|&s;engers of death; and &s;till their horrid deed was &s;u&s;pended. A &s;udden and violent tumult recalled my dying &s;en&s;es, the noi&s;e grew nearer and louder. I &s;tarted at the cla&s;h of arms: I heard a groan. The crowd pre&s;t in upon me, and I &s;aw Les Roches, my kind pre&s;erver, his eyes darting rage, and his wea|pon reeking with &s;laughter.' 'There lies the wretch, &s;aid he, who dared to lift his &s;word again&s;t my approach.' 'I threw my&s;elf into his bloody arms, in a rapturous extacy of joy and gratitude, and ju&s;t found breath to exclaim, Gracious powers! am I then re&s;cued from the ba&s;e murderer's arm?' 'Mur|der! cried Les Roches; 'for this horrid purpo&s;e then wert thou detained here! But it is well: there wanted but this to confirm tho&s;e brave &s;pirits, who feel and will revenge our wrongs. No pri&s;oner now! No concealed fugitive! Lord William &s;hall confront his enemy; and take his free cour&s;e, undaunted and uncontrouled in the fair face of day; and &s;corn the malice of this injurious Count. But ha&s;te&mdash;and let us join our friends.'</P>
<P>I obeyed the joyful &s;ummons; but fir&s;t &s;earched for my armour, which the guards, who&s;e power was now expired, had taken from me. The attendants of Les Roches buckled on my harne&s;s, and I once
<PB N="28" REF="27">more gra&s;ped my &s;word. I i&s;&s;ued forth as if re|&s;tored from the grave, accompanied by Les Roches and his companions, leading away my guards whom they had overpowered. And &s;carcely had we mea|&s;ured out the di&s;tance of an arrow's flight, when we de&s;cried a gallant troop marching toward us, who rai&s;ed a &s;hout of triumph at our approach, and re|ceived us with the joy of brethren and a&s;&s;ociates. I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize, but was &s;oon taught the rea|&s;on of this appearance, and the cau&s;e of my &s;urpriz|ing change of fortune. I now learned that Mal|leon, like the un&s;kilful &s;oldier who by the force of his own ill-directed blow is oftentimes tumbled to the ground, was defeated in the purpo&s;es of his malice, by the blind and furious impetuo&s;ity of that very malice. In his fir&s;t rage of di&s;appointed re|venge, he had injured and in&s;ulted a brave chief; who had ranged his numerous adherents under the banners of this proud Count, and given their &s;words to &s;upport his power. The gentle manners of Les Roches had ever commanded the affections of his adherents, and now, when they &s;aw their chief thru&s;t into the vile dungeon, in contempt of all his former &s;ervices; and for no crime, but the &s;u&s;picion of having &s;pared an helple&s;s wanderer, their mutiny, like the noi&s;e of di&s;tant thunder, tho' not violent, was yet terrible; and &s;truck the ear with the threa|tenings of an approaching &s;torm. Mal-leon quickly perceived the danger, and endeavoured to corred his ha&s;ty error, by relea&s;ing Les Roches from his captivity. But little did this ungracious conde&s;cen|&s;ion allay the ferment of his va&s;&s;als, little did the chief regard this extorted act of ju&s;tice, as the repa|ration due to his injured honour and little did it allay the ardor of his affection and &s;olicitude for the man he now called his friend. It was his fir&s;t care to employ the liberty he had regained, in my protec|tion; and with a few cho&s;en followers he in&s;tantly ha&s;tened to the &s;hore, whither he had directed the faithful pea&s;ant to conduct me. But Sali&s;bury was not to be found. Yet &s;till flattered with the hope
<PB N="29" REF="28">that my &s;peed had prevented him, and that I had already embarqued, he returned with his attendants, to whom he di&s;tinctly related our fir&s;t encounter in the i&s;land, and his cares to defend me from the ma|lice of my rival. They were taught to love me, to pity my fortunes, and to rejoice in my &s;uppo&s;ed e|&s;cape. The infection &s;pread among their a&s;&s;ociates. I became the general object of their di&s;cour&s;e; when &s;uddenly, the pea&s;ant who had fled from me in wild affright, to inform his ma&s;ter of my &s;ituation, arri|ved and acquainted them, that, amid&s;t all my dan|gers, I had ob&s;tinately re&s;olved not to abandon my friend, but to &s;hare his fortune; in de&s;pite of all the power and cruelty of Mal-leon. Scarcely had he in|formed them of his own error, and the place where he had left me, when the news arrived of my being &s;eized, and detained until the Count might declare his plea&s;ure. Not the fla&s;hing lightning when it has broken in upon a fore&s;t of our &s;tately oaks, ever rai&s;ed a more &s;udden and violent conflagration, than the&s;e accounts kindled in the minds of the brave &s;ol|diers of Les Roches. It was at once re&s;olved for ever to abandon the &s;ervice of a tyrannical and re|vengeful Lord, and to re&s;cue me from his oppre&s;&s;ive power. But their Chief wi&s;ely laboured to temper and allay the violence which threatened to defeat it's own purpo&s;e. By his per&s;ua&s;ion it was determined to act with &s;ecrecy and caution: to wait until darkne&s;s might conceal their motions, and to chu&s;e the dead hour of midnight, to &s;urprize my guards, and to &s;natch me from the cruel malice of my enemy. E|ternal goodne&s;s! that directed their hearts, and guided their &s;teps, be witne&s;s for me, with what gratitude I received my miraculous pre&s;ervation! No longer the helple&s;s victim of fell revenge, no longer crouching under the ruthle&s;s arm of a ru&s;&s;ian, I felt my afflictions no more: they vani&s;hed like a fright|ful dream, which the chearful beams of morning had di&s;&s;ipated. And I now appeared as indeed a &s;ol|dier, encompa&s;&s;ed by a hardy band, in the gay trim of war, to which the ri&s;ing light gave new lu&s;tre:
<PB N="30" REF="29">&s;till farther irritated by the black de&s;ign of murder; loudly encouraging me to rely on their protection, and to bid defiance to the ungenerous cruel Count. Nor was this confidence &s;lightly founded; for I learned that by their revolt Mal-leon was deprived of a force, which fully equalled all that yet remained under his command.</P>

<P>THEY now marched on, publickly di&s;claiming all obedience but to their chief Les Roches; not as intending ho&s;tilities, but determined to retire from the i&s;land; and to demon&s;trate the &s;incerity of their declarations, the guards lately overpowered were already freed and courteou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; nor was even the &s;urviving ruffian detained. Count Sa|vour&egrave; could not look with unconcern at &s;o alarming a defection in his troops. All his remaining force was in&s;tantly collected, and &s;oon we were confronted by a con&s;iderable body led by the proud Count, that &s;topped our farther progre&s;s: and while each party drew up in formidable array, each was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with anxiety and expectation. On our &s;ide, a firm re&s;olution to &s;upport our purpo&s;e to the la&s;t, was un|alterably fixed in every heart, yet with humane con|cern and generous reluctance again&s;t &s;hedding the blood of countrymen, endeared by natural affection, and a long &s;ocial intercour&s;e. The little armies &s;tood for a while in a &s;tate of &s;ullen inaction lowering upon each other: a delay which &s;eemed to declare that neither pre&s;umed on any &s;uperiority, and that both expected, and de&s;ired a parly. This was at length propo&s;ed by my friend, and readily accepted.</P>
<P>The commanders on each &s;ide advanced with a few attendants: and fir&s;t Mal-leon proudly demand|ed the rea&s;on of this appearance of di&s;loyalty and ho&s;|tility. Les Roches repelled his accu&s;ation by re|counting the injuries that had been offered to his honour and independance: urged the ungrateful re|turns
<PB N="31" REF="30">made to his free and faithful &s;ervices, by a vile unprovoked impri&s;onment, and declared that his &s;ole purpo&s;e was to withdraw his arms from a Lord, who had loaded him with wrongs and di&s;grace. To this the Count replied, that the pre&s;ent appearance di&s;|covered clearly the nece&s;&s;ity and the ju&s;tice of his late conduct: that it now plainly appeared, that Les Roches had united with his enemy and the enemy of his country, to tear the i&s;land from him; and that far from having oppre&s;&s;ed or injured him, nothing but his own mi&s;taken lenity had enabled a fal&s;e Frenchman to proceed in this traiterous de&s;ign. For this had he re&s;cued from him the man who had ba&s;e|ly &s;tolen upon his territory, to corrupt his dependants, and to arm them again&s;t their Lord; for this he had murdered his officer, who gallantly oppo&s;ed his un|ju&s;t attempt; and for this he now &s;tood in arms, ready to &s;acrifice his kin&s;men and countrymen to the treacherous purpo&s;e of an Engli&s;hman, who did not dare to meet him bravely in the field, but la|boured to de&s;troy him by the &s;ecret practices of fraud and circumvention.</P>
<P>To this my friend an&s;wered with a generous warmth, That as my &s;oul was incapable of a ba&s;e de|&s;ign, &s;o my manner of coming into the i&s;land plain|ly removed all &s;u&s;picions of any attempt again&s;t his government: that, ca&s;t as I was upon his &s;hore, helple&s;s and unattended by any numbers that could create the lea&s;t fear, my endeavours had &s;olely been exerted to elude his &s;earch, and to regain my native country: that all his own offence had been an en|deavour, tho' fruitle&s;s, to favour the &s;ecret retreat of a noble enemy to whom he owed his life and liber|ty: nor could he repent of his grateful efforts, when no ran&s;om was to be accepted, no captivity or re|&s;traint was deemed &s;ufficiently &s;evere, for a noble, generous, and unhappy Lord; when the ruffian had been hired to &s;hed his blood, and in the dead hour of night dared to lift the murderous dagger a|gain&s;t his unoffending, un&s;u&s;pecting innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
Su&s;picion, grief and indignation now rai&s;ed a con|fu&s;ed murmur among the attendants of Mal-leon; the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions, together with the &s;tory of in|tended murder, quickly reached their a&s;&s;ociates and &s;pread contagiou&s;ly through their lines. While the angui&s;h of confu&s;ion, &s;hame, revenge, and di&s;ap|pointment, turned the a&s;pect of Count Savour&egrave; to gha&s;tly pale. Yet, dreading the effects of this di&s;|covery, he &s;oon endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a look of com|po&s;ure and con&s;cious integrity; exclaimed loudly again&s;t the infamous contrivance to de&s;troy his ho|nour, and vehemently di&s;avowed all intentions, but &s;uch as were fully warranted by the laws of honour|able war. This declaration &s;ilenced the di&s;order in his troops; who&s;e hone&s;t hearts could not, without regret, believe their general guilty of &s;o black an at|tempt: he warmly repeated his profe&s;&s;ions of inno|cence; and called for the &s;oldier &s;aid to be accom|plice to him in who&s;e brea&s;t Les Roches had plunged his &s;word. The &s;teady villain now &s;tood forth, and a&s;&s;umed &s;uch a countenance as effectually concealed his fal&s;ehood from every human eye. In the face of both the armies, falling upon his knees and lifting up his eyes towards heaven, he called on every &s;aint to bear witne&s;s to his innocence, and with horrid imprecations of the divine wrath, declared, that the only orders of his Lord had been to treat their pri&s;o|ner with re&s;pect and care befitting an illu&s;trious &s;ol|dier. The con&s;tancy and the fair appearance of in|genuous &s;incerity which accompanied the&s;e &s;olemn declarations, failed not of their de&s;ired effect: the troops of Count Mal-leon were fired with indigna|tion, and joyed to find that their commander had not acted unworthy of his own and of his country's ho|nour; they expre&s;&s;ed a violent and tumultuous rage again&s;t the author of this &s;uppo&s;ed calumny; whil&s;t the adherents of the good Les Roches were confoun|ded and aba&s;ed. Their eyes were turned upon me, with &s;u&s;picion and cold di&s;tru&s;t; the bolde&s;t among them ventured to break out into rude invectives, and to propo&s;e that I &s;hould be in&s;tantly delivered up into
<PB N="33" REF="32">the hands of their brave countryman, whom I had &s;o ba&s;ely abu&s;ed by my horrid imputations. My enemy exulted; my friend, tho' &s;till amply &s;atisfied of my truth and honour, was perplexed and grieved; and the late of Sali&s;bury &s;eemed to depend on a &s;ingle moment of tumult and confu&s;ion; when with an ef|fort of de&s;perate re&s;olution I &s;tepped forth, and both parties hung upon me with looks of mute &s;u&s;pen&s;e and expectation, I recounted plainly and clearly all my adventures, &s;ince fortune had driven me to this unkind &s;hore; my departure from the Abbey, with a full intention of re&s;igning my&s;elf into the power of the Count, in order to pre&s;erve my friend: my being &s;eized by the guards, and detained on the &s;pot where they had found me, in&s;tead of being conducted to pri&s;on, or to the pre&s;ence of Mal-leon; a circum&s;tance full of &s;u&s;picion! I de&s;cribed that dreadful night in all its horrors, when I had been &s;o wonderfully delivered from in&s;tant death. And if any doubt remained of my truth and &s;inceri|ty, I offered to make my &s;olemn appeal to heaven. There! &s;aid I, ca&s;ting down my gage, I am ready to prove upon that recreant Lord his vile fal&s;ehoods, and to a&s;&s;ert my own innocence, and his di&s;honour, in &s;ingle combat.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t &s;een two gallant bands clo&s;ing with each other; and for a while maintaining the conflict in terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e, pre&s;&s;ed and receding, recovering and pre&s;&s;ing, by turns, until one mighty effort deter|mines the fortune of the day, and the whole tumul|tuous rout of vanqui&s;hed and victors, pour along the plain. Such had been the war of pailions in the&s;e two parties, and &s;uch was now the force with which both were hurried away. My bold challenge was re|ceived with an univer&s;al acclamation by men too zealous votaries of warlike glory and honour, to de|&s;ire, that ba&s;ene&s;s and fal&s;ehood &s;hould be &s;upported or concealed. Shame forbad the Count to decline this hardy trial, and tho' appalled by con&s;cious guilt, he accepted my defiance. Les Roches, who&s;e friend|ly cares never were diverted from me, demanded an
<PB N="34" REF="33">interval of two days to re&s;tore my hara&s;&s;ed mind and body to their native vigour, and to prepare me for the encounter. This could not be refu&s;ed; the time, the place, and every previous circum&s;tance was &s;oon adju&s;ted as the laws of arms require; and each party drew off in &s;ilent expectation of the event.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd morning, as I revolved my late dan|gers, and indulged the plea&s;ing thoughts of my fate being &s;oon to be decided by the fair and honourable chance of arms, an officer from count Mal-leon ap|peared before the place of my re&s;idence and demand|ed admi&s;&s;ion to Lord Sali&s;bury. I received him ac|companied by my friend. 'Count Savour&egrave;, &s;aid he, thir&s;ts not for thy blood. It hath been thy de&s;ire to depart this i&s;land in peace: he commands me to ac|quaint thee that a barque is prepared, and that thou maye&s;t, unoppo&s;ed and unmole&s;ted, &s;eek thy native land: he wi&s;hes not to detain thee, nor regards the honour of vanqui&s;hing Lord William as the lea&s;t ac|ce&s;&s;ion to his renown.' My eyes darted fiery indigna|tion upon this me&s;&s;enger of abject fear. 'I defy his power, &s;aid I, and &s;corn his friend&s;hip. I &s;tay not here by his permi&s;&s;ion, and without his permi&s;&s;ion will I depart. Thinks he that an Engli&s;h Lord will fully his fair fame, and meanly &s;teal away from ho|nourable danger? Bear back my defiance to the man who could entertain &s;o ba&s;e a thought. Tell him I &s;hall here wait, and wait with impatience for the dawning of to-morrow.' The officer departed: my friend embraced me with tears of joy, whil&s;t I felt my heart chearful and dilated; and from this over|ture derived an happy pre&s;age of victory.</P>
<P>The morning of combat now appeared; nor did I wait the &s;ummons of my friends, but impatient for the great deci&s;ion, I prevented their officious care and &s;tood before them in arms, demanding to be con|ducted to the lifts. The&s;e were prepared with every accu&s;tomed provi&s;ion and defence again&s;t fraud or treachery. And while I entered on one &s;ide attended by Les Roches and his cho&s;en companions, Count Sa|vour&egrave; appeared with an equal number of attendants
<PB N="35" REF="34">on the other, darting looks of deadly hate, rather than of manly valour. We advanced towards each other, not with the courte&s;y of honourable rivals, but &s;ul|len and indignant, &s;ilent and di&s;dainful. Our a&s;&s;i&s;tants having fir&s;t exacted the u&s;ual oaths, in which we di&s;|claimed all unlawful methods of defence, all fraudu|lent or magical re&s;ources, &s;eparated us from each o|ther, and pointed out our ju&s;t &s;tations. Here while our hor&s;es pawed the ground, impatient to &s;tart for|ward, we waited the &s;ignal of the trumpets; when &s;uddenly our attendants bur&s;t into the middle &s;pace, and called upon us to di&s;mount. We obeyed; and as I advanced towards the crowd of knights and &s;quires, I &s;oon di&s;covered my dear and reverend friend the Abbot, directing and commanding them with a paternal authority. Two were ordered to take charge of our hor&s;es and our weapons, whil&s;t the father approached and invited us to a private conference. Lord Mal-leon,' &s;aid he, 'hear me, and tremble at thy pre&s;umption: tempt not the wrath of heaven, by expo&s;ing thy&s;elf to the hazard of arms, in a cau&s;e which thou knowe&s;t is unju&s;t. And do thou, Lord William, remember, that thou art for bid|den to &s;eek a brutal revenge.' The Count was ju&s;t preparing to expre&s;s his indignation at &s;uch a bold and unexpected interruption, when the father &s;urvey|ing him with a look of pity, mixed with &s;ome degree of &s;corn, proceeded thus: 'The wretch hired by thee to &s;hed the blood of this unhappy Lord, tho' &s;orely wounded by Les Roches, was yet left with &s;ome remains of life; the pea&s;ants bore him to our hou&s;e for relief, and gho&s;tly comfort. There he ex|pired; but not before his parting breath had publickly declared the dreadful purpo&s;e&mdash;but I will not wound thy ears with the horrid recital. Alas! thy &s;hame is but too well known. If thou ha&s;t yet the &s;malle&s;t remains of goodne&s;s, dare not by this combat to de|fy the award of heaven; nor longer pur&s;ue this Lord with cau&s;ele&s;s hatred.' My rival now &s;eemed to &s;hrink before me, into all the meanne&s;s of di&s;grace, and abject ba&s;ene&s;s: whil&s;t my triumph was more ex|alted,
<PB N="36" REF="35">than the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful event of combat could have given. My eyes were lighted up with indignation, but my heart di&s;dained reproaches. Whil&s;t I embraced the reverend father, and freely &s;ubmitted my arms to his direction and controul, angui&s;h, &s;hame, remor&s;e, and envy &s;eemed to tear the &s;oul of Mal-leon with their united tortures; tears? bur&s;t from him, not the gentle drops of penitence; but tears of vexation, of di&s;appointed and detected malice. Silent and trembling, he &s;eemed irre&s;olute for &s;ome moments: then, in &s;ullen and broken ac|cents, he ju&s;t forced out; 'I will not&mdash;depart&mdash; I will not fight with thee&mdash;my pri&s;oner&mdash;yet I &s;eek no ran&s;om: retire from this i&s;land; and henceforth avoid my fury. Here a loud &s;hout prevented my reply. The &s;oldiers of Les Roches, by this time informed of the tidings which the Abbot brought, and which were no longer &s;ecret, ha&s;tened to re|ceive me with their gratulations; and whil&s;t they accompanied me to their camp, the ba&s;e Count, followed by a &s;ilent and dejected party, marched away, and covered his di&s;graced head in the rece&s;&s;es of his ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>THE good old Knight could not &s;uppre&s;s his exultation at the final i&s;&s;ue of this dangerous conte&s;t. He pre&s;t the hand of Lord William with an affectionate warmth, and congratulated him on his vic|tory over his ba&s;e and treacherous foe, a victory much more compleat, much more mortifying to his rival, than could po&s;&s;ibly have been acquired by arms. But the Earl &s;oon re&s;trained his joy, by acquainting him, that this event did not put an end to his dangers. Randolph once more compo&s;ed him&s;elf into a grave and earne&s;t attention, and Lord William thus re&s;umed the &s;tory of his fortunes.</P>
<Q><P>To retire from this odious &s;cene of my calamity, was now the great purpo&s;e upon which my &s;oul was fixed. I had lei&s;ure to indulge my wi&s;hes to regain my friends, my country and my wife; and earne&s;tly entreated Les Roches to crown all his goodne&s;s by &s;peedily recalling my countrymen, and providing a ve&s;&s;el to convey us to the Engli&s;h &s;hore. He expre&s;|&s;ed his &s;urprize and concern at this reque&s;t, he urged the danger of attempting a return, without a force &s;ufficient to defend me again&s;t an enemy who could not be a &s;tranger to &s;uch a de&s;ign, and who&s;e deadly hate mu&s;t prompt him to arre&s;t me in my pa&s;&s;age. No, my friend, &s;aid he, attend us into France. South of the city of Poictiers my ca&s;tle lies: at no inconvenient di&s;tance from the coa&s;t. Thither permit me to conduct thee: and thence with a re|tinue befitting his greatne&s;s, &s;hall Earl William be attended in honour and &s;ecurity to England.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
The apprehen&s;ions of falling once more into the hands of malice and in&s;olent revenge, prevailed over my impatience, and determined me to embrace this friendly coun&s;el. A few cho&s;en followers were di&s;|patched to Rochelle, where my countrymen lay in anxious expectation of their leader, who informed them of our fortunes, and, after an interval of &s;ome days, returned with all conveniences for tran&s;porting the forces of Les Roches. Our embarkation wore a gay and gallant a&s;pect, conducted with chearfulne&s;s and zeal, without fear of danger or controul. The la&s;t ve&s;&s;el had now received my friend and me, and was on the point of leaving the &s;hore; when we di&s;|covered a &s;oldier ha&s;tening down towards us, and with extended arms entreating to he received. We demanded his name, and the rea&s;on of his extraor|dinary appearance. 'Alas! cried he, with that a|ba&s;ement which marks out calamity and oppre&s;&s;ion; but ye&s;terday the officer of Mal-leon, favoured and honoured by my leader; now the victim of his wild revenge, unle&s;s your protection &s;hall deign to &s;hield the unfortunate D'Aumont.' Here our atten|tion was awakened, and I &s;oon di&s;covered that he was that me&s;&s;enger who the morning before our in|tended combat, had acco&s;ted me with tho&s;e overtures which fear had extorted from Mal-leon. As he &s;tood upon the beach, with the pa&s;&s;ionate warmth of a &s;incere and deeply-pierced mind, the &s;oldier thus proceeded. 'When in&s;olent revenge and cruelty point their ungenerous fury again&s;t a valiant but un|fortunate rival, what heart mu&s;t not be moved; and what brave &s;on of war can conceal his indignation? Let the coward di&s;&s;emble his emotions; alas I have not learned his virtue, nor know I that mean re&s;erve which he calls prudence. Lord Sali&s;bury is the ene|my of Count Savour&egrave;, but a gallant and an honour|able enemy. Let me ever emulate his exalted vir|tues, and &s;corn the ba&s;e and cruel envy that would oppre&s;s them. We were &s;oon no &s;trangers to his fortunes; and while the abject minions of a proud Lord &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their pity; my thoughts were not
<PB N="39" REF="38">&s;o obedient to controul; they forced their way bold|ly: and &s;urprized my fellow &s;oldiers with the mo&s;t ardent expre&s;&s;ions of indignation at the malice of our leader, who&s;e flatterers trea&s;ured up the dange|rous di&s;cour&s;e, and failed not to convey it faithfully to his ear. And now D'Aumont was marked out for de&s;truction: when rage and vengeance were rea|dy to &s;eize me, I fled. If my &s;ervices may merit your protection, u&s;e them, and &s;ave me from ruin. Should Savour&egrave; &s;pare and forgive me; witne&s;s, ye holy angels! this arm &s;hall never draw it's weapon for that di&s;honourable Lord. No! if I am aban|doned, let me wander in di&s;graceful ob&s;curity, let me feel the hard hand of want and poverty, or let me die rather than be made, perhaps, the mini&s;ter of bloody cruelty on &s;ome brave &s;oldier, who hath become odious by his virtues.'&mdash;Dangerous hypo|cri&s;y! how exactly can&s;t thou a&s;&s;ume the faire&s;t &s;em|blances of goodne&s;s! O why &s;hould generous and ingenuous minds be more particularly the prey of thine accur&s;ed artifice?&mdash;We received him with|out the lea&s;t difficulty or &s;u&s;picion; and his wiley arts of in&s;inuation not only wrought us to pity, but &s;oon commanded our affections and implicit confi|dence. On me his attention was perpetually en|gaged, ever officious in performing all the little offices which be&s;poke re&s;pect and love. His tears flowed in&s;tantly at the mention of my misfortunes; his eyes were lighted up with indignation, at the very name of my enemy. If we &s;poke of his cru|elty, he trembled; if of his cowardice, he &s;miled with contempt, or frowned with &s;tern abhorrence. In a word, the ardor of his affection &s;eemed not &s;o much the effect of humanity, as of a long, an inti|mate and tender friend&s;hip. Les Roches admired the virtues of this D'Aumont: nor could my heart refu&s;e it's full return of affection and gratitude to &s;uch exalted goodne&s;s. D'Aumont became our friend and coun&s;ellor: he &s;hared our thoughts and directed our actions.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">
We were now happily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ived at Rochelle, where I embraced my countrymen, who&s;e &s;u&s;pen&s;e and apprehen&s;ions were at length di&s;pelled. Filled with joy and gay expectations, we all advanced forward towards the domain of our kind protector, confident of comfort and &s;ecurity under his ho&s;pitable roof. His followers, no longer deeming their &s;ervices ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their Lord, and impatient to revi&s;it their &s;everal habitations, &s;eparated in their march; and left us, not wholly unattended, but at the head of an incon&s;iderable body, when we at length arrived at the ca&s;tle of Les Roches. Here we had been taught to expect the cheerful welcome of affection; and here we now looked for joy and congratulation, the kind greetings of friends, and the officious cares of dome&s;tics. But alas, we had entered the man&s;ion of &s;orrow. On every face &s;at &s;ilent grief and con&s;ter|nation, and chilled our &s;ouls with terrible apprehen|&s;ions. My friend ca&s;t his eyes round with the mo&s;t earne&s;t anxiety; &s;ometimes they turned on me; now on his attendants. At length he ru&s;hed precipitately from us, and traver&s;ed the apartments, as if in &s;earch of &s;omething particularly dear to him. I looked upon D'Aumont, who &s;eemed equally a&s;to|ni&s;hed and equally uninformed of the cau&s;e of this &s;trange di&s;order. Some few broken exclamations of &s;urprize and &s;ollicitude were all that my tongue could utter. Tortured with expectation, and impa|tience to know the wor&s;t that fortune threatened, I eagerly waited the return of my friend, certain to receive the news of &s;ome calamity, but utterly in|capable of forming the lea&s;t conjecture of its nature, circum&s;tances or extent. Les Roches prolonged his ab&s;ence to a tedious and afflicting length. At la&s;t a dome&s;tic appeared, and called for D'Aumont; who as he departed, turned upon me with a look of &s;ur|prize and concern, then vani&s;hed, and le&s;t me to all the torture of uncertainty. A thou&s;and extrava|gant conjectures did my fancy form, and reject by turns. My countrymen, equally perplexed and agi|tated, gazed on me and each other in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
<PB N="41" REF="40">'Good heaven! what new wonders! for what are we re&s;erved!' Thus did I exclaim; and in that moment &s;ome attendants entered, and with cour|teous and gentle demeanour inviting us to follow, conducted us to &s;everal chambers where refre&s;hment was provided with all ho&s;pitable care; yet in all the &s;ilence and &s;olemnity of &s;orrow. Thrice did I e&s;&s;ay to &s;peak my wonder, and as often did fear &s;uppre&s;s my voice. Still my friend delayed his appearance, but after a tedious and di&s;tracting interval, D'Au|mont at length &s;tood before me, with an a&s;pect which redoubled all that horror which my &s;oul had for &s;ome time felt. I eagerly enquired about Les Roches; Alas, &s;aid he, I know not what &s;udden gloom hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Baron. He hath long &s;ince departed with a few attendants: on me devolves the command of this ca&s;tle. I am now his officer, and mu&s;t implicitly obey his orders: and his orders are that the Lord of Sali&s;bury &s;hould be entertained with all due honours: a pri&s;oner indeed, but a noble pri|&s;oner, the rigours of his con&s;inement mu&s;t be duly allayed, by re&s;pect and careful attention.' I &s;tarted and exclaimed&mdash;'Pri&s;oner! Confinement! Ex|plain this wonder.' 'Such, &s;aid he, are the com|mands of Les Roches. This chamber mu&s;t content thee. The guards who are to confine thee within the&s;e bounds are enjoyned the &s;tricte&s;t vigilance, yet with due deference and care to do thee &s;ervice.' Do I dream? cried I, is this real? is this my ho&s;pi|table reception?' Then pre&s;&s;ing the hand of D'Au|mont, who&s;e dejected looks &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ym|pathy, and tender pity, I eagerly urged him to give me the whole &s;tory of this &s;urprizing change. Again indulging my di&s;tractions; 'Is Les Roches fal&s;e to me? &s;aid I. O no, it cannot be; the good, the tender, the affectionate Les Roches, my friend, my pre&s;erver? Do not wrong his virtues. It cannot be. Where is he? why delays he? O wretch, why do&s;t thou torment my &s;oul with idle terrors?</P>
<P>The Frenchman appeared violently moved at my di&s;order. His tears (for he could command tears)
<PB N="42" REF="41">flowed freely: his &s;ighs were deep and frequent; and his voice broken and interrupted: at length, as if recollecting &s;ome &s;hare of rea&s;on and calm reflec|tion, 'Unhappy Lord! &s;aid he, too truly have I declared thy &s;ituation. But what hath moved Les Roches to this, or for what fortunes Earl William is re&s;erved, alas, is yet a &s;ecret to D'Aumont. Too true it is that &s;ome extraordinary event hath called away the Lord of this place. Perhaps he hath found it nece&s;&s;ary to deliver thee back into the power of Mal-leon; perhaps he hath re&s;cued thee from the rage of that proud Count, that he may have the glory of di&s;playing to his countrymen an illu&s;trious captive won by him&s;elf. But I fear his virtue mo&s;t. Yes it mu&s;t be &s;o. He hath indeed pre&s;erved thee from the treacherous attempts of ba&s;e envy, but his duty to his Prince and to his country forbids him to re&s;tore to England the champion that hath fought her battles again&s;t France. O rigid &s;en&s;e of duty, that thus tears a&s;under the bands of nature and friend&s;hip! Happy D'Aumont, who&s;e &s;oul a&s;|pires not to &s;uch high unfeeling virtue! who cannot re&s;i&s;t the tender &s;ollicitations of pity! Let me ever indulge the kind emotion, uncontrouled by rigorous &s;cruples, or &s;plendid notions of duty, too &s;evere and too exalted for humanity.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions exactly an&s;wered to his purpo&s;e. My &s;oul was too much di&s;ordered to examine them by the rules of calm deliberate rea&s;on; and the emo|tion which he a&s;&s;umed, increa&s;ed my inward tumult, and gave him entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart. In this fatal moment, the tenderne&s;s, the zeal, the &s;ollici|tude, the &s;ufferings of Les Roches all vani&s;hed from my thoughts. I had even forgotten the confu|&s;ion which appeared in his ca&s;tle on our arrival, and his own &s;urprize and concern. I had forgotten that &s;ome unexpected event mu&s;t have torn him from me. I imputed his ab&s;ence to no other cau&s;e but the &s;hame of encountering the looks and reproaches of a man whom he had betrayed: and all confu&s;ed and di&s;|tracted as I was, re&s;igned my&s;elf entirely to the in|fluence
<PB N="43" REF="42">of this new friend, who&s;e power was like that of tho&s;e infernal imps who, they &s;ay, command the winds to roar or to be &s;till, and the waves to &s;well or to &s;ub&s;ide, as their wicked purpo&s;es require. As he depre&s;&s;ed or rou&s;ed me, I melted into grief, or raged in all the violence of vain and impotent indig|nation. I now con&s;idered my&s;elf as an helple&s;s prey, doomed to inevitable de&s;truction, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by my hunters, and fatally lured to their toils. Nor was D'Aumont at all &s;ollicitious to di&s;|pel my fears. He expatiated on the horrors of a dun|geon, on the wretchedne&s;s of captivity, the cruel tyranny of exa&s;perated enemies and rivals, the lo&s;s of friends and honours; years of bondage &s;pent in gloomy &s;olitude, in u&s;ele&s;s inaction: the gazing cu|rio&s;ity of the ba&s;e and ignoble, the in&s;olence and triumphant &s;corn of the coward, who had perhaps trembled at my &s;word, and fled from my arm in battle: then, as if afraid to dwell upon the terrible idea, he ju&s;t hinted at the tears of my friends, and the &s;orrow of an helple&s;s widowed wife.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou never heard that the enemy of man|kind oftentimes pre&s;ents &s;hocking and frightful phan|toms before the eyes of the holy hermit, in order to di&s;tract his thoughts and to confound his purpo&s;es? Such were the arts by which this Frenchman prac|ti&s;ed upon my &s;oul. I &s;tarted up in a &s;udden fit of fury and extravagance. I cur&s;ed my own blindne&s;s and folly, that had betrayed me into the power of my enemies; and when I had once e&s;caped, had &s;e|duced me into France, in&s;tead of &s;teering directly for the &s;hore of England. Then madly &s;eizing D' Aumont, I thundered out terrible execrations on his head, and wild menaces of vengeance, as an accom|plice in cur&s;ed treachery. He trembled; and with &s;ilent looks and tears &s;eemed kindly to reproach my unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions: then in broken and imperfect words, appeared to &s;truggle with his pa&s;&s;ions, and complained of the wrong done to his friend&s;hip. I in&s;tantly melted into all the tenderne&s;s of grief and affection: and ardently embracing the Frenchman,
<PB N="44" REF="43">I acknowledged my error, and reque&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and coun&s;el, in this my dangerous &s;ituation. 'Alas! &s;aid he, if I am true to Sali&s;bury, I mu&s;t betray Les Roches. Hard &s;ituation for the &s;oldier, who owes exact obedience to the dictates of duty and honour. But too well I feel that my heart is not &s;ecured again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of pity. Yes I am thine! and wholly thine! Here he cla&s;ped me in his arms: and thus proceeded. I mu&s;t deliver thee; and one moment's delay may deprive me of that power. Here we mu&s;t not abide. Let us depart together; and let me &s;hare thy for|tune. Some friends I have that &s;hall receive and comfort thee. I know the way that leads to the coa&s;t, and will conduct thee. Thence may Lord Sali&s;bury &s;oon find the means of returning to his native country: and thither (for thou wilt not leave me to the mercy of our common unemies) &s;hall D' Aumont attend thee. I heard him with eagerne&s;s, and implicit confidence. Without pau&s;e or reflecti|on I &s;ubmitted to his guidance; and in that very hour, we both departed from the ca&s;tle.</P></Q>

<P>THUS had I ra&s;hly ventured forth into a wide and unknown &s;cene of danger; under the direction of a fal&s;e guide, who&s;e treachery was &s;oon di&s;covered. It was night; and the moon ca&s;t her mild gleam over all the pro&s;pect that lay before us. D'Aumont repeated his a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip, &s;poke with chearfulne&s;s and confidence, encouraging me to hope, and to fix my reliance on his &s;ervices. I expected every in&s;tant to be conducted to &s;ome place of retirement and friendly recepiton. Some|times I expre&s;&s;ed my unea&s;ine&s;s, but ever and anon my guide practi&s;ed his arts of &s;oothing per&s;ua&s;ion, and flattering profe&s;&s;ions, to allay my fears; thus we proceeded for &s;ome hours: at length, in our tedious progre&s;s, we pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;kirts of a thick fore&s;t, from whence our ears were fir&s;t pierced with
<PB N="45" REF="44">&s;hrill and lamentable &s;hrieks as if from a female voice, and in&s;tantly afterwards, there i&s;&s;ued out a &s;mall number of armed men, who &s;urrounded us, and demanded our names and quality. My companion, nothing alarmed at this appearance, made the like enquiries on his part, and learned that they were the &s;oldiers of Chauvigny Lord of Poictiers. I &s;eek that Lord, [&s;aid he; when one of the &s;oldiers &s;ur|veying him attentively, replied, D'Aumont!&mdash; I know thee now! what from Count Mal-leon! I &s;tarted at the hideous name, and turning on my companion, perceived that the blood had de&s;erted his cheeks, and that he &s;tood in violent agitations. But ere I could expre&s;s my wonder, retiring a &s;ew paces from me he cried out, there &s;tands Lord Sali&s;bury: my purpo&s;e was to conduct him to Poictiers: he is now your pri&s;oner, and let him be quickly conveyed to your Lord. I &s;tood confound|ed for a moment at this a&s;toni&s;hing treachery, then quickly drawing my &s;word, I ran furiou&s;ly upon D' Aumont; nor was it without the utmo&s;t difficulty that the &s;oldiers re&s;trained my ju&s;t vengeance, over|powered, and di&s;armed me; then leading me into the wood, we joined &s;ome others of their body, who were intently engaged on a &s;pectacle of pity.</P>
<P>A youth who &s;eemed ju&s;t ri&s;ing to manhood, of graceful form, tall of &s;tature, and with limbs of perfect &s;hape, lay &s;orely wounded upon the ground, languid, pale, and bloody. Over him hung one in the habit of a page, younger and &s;till more exqui&s;itely beautiful, piercing the air with lamentations, and eagerly employed in binding up the wounds of the fallen youth, with locks of comely auburn, torn from a fair though di&s;hevelled head. No &s;ooner bad the &s;oldiers proclaimed my name to their a&s;&s;ociates, than the page, turning up|on me with a face which di&s;covered one of nature's mo&s;t lovely productions, &s;ullied and di&s;ordered by grief, ju&s;t exclaimed; O fatal cau&s;e of all my mi|&s;ery!' then bending down again, as if di&s;daining attention to any but one favourite object, re&s;umed
<PB N="46" REF="45">the charitable cares of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and &s;upporting the wounded youth; who by this time revived from his trance, and ca&s;t a languid look of love and tenderne&s;s upon his kind companion. 'O Jacque|line, &s;aid he, are we then prevented? But thou ha&s;t e&s;caped the pre&s;ent danger. Nor &s;hall force tear me from thee, or time efface thy remembrance.' This was an&s;wered with deep &s;ighs and tender looks, which &s;poke an affection ardent and power|ful, tho' controuled by the pre&s;ence of &s;trangers. Every word and every action increa&s;ed my &s;urprize. Utterly unable to conceive how any part of the di&s;tre&s;s I now beheld could be imputed to me, I attempted with all courte&s;y to acco&s;t the page; who, on the other hand, had no eyes, no ear, no voice for me. But how was my a&s;toni&s;hed &s;oul afflicted and confounded, when one of the &s;oldiers ca&s;ually di&s;covered, that this page was no other than a young maiden, and daughter to Les Roches! Whil&s;t &s;he was bu&s;ily employed about the wounded youth, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;oldiers rai&s;ing him from the ground, I turned to D'Aumont with looks of rage and angui&s;h. Wretch! &s;aid I, explain this wonder. Is this the work of thy cur&s;ed treachery? No, proud Lord, replied the fal&s;e Frenchman; This youth is &s;on to Count Chauvigny, who&s;e pri&s;oner I have made thee: but were he mine enemy, I am no murderer. Witne&s;s for me, that if my nature had been cruel, I might have plunged the dagger into thine own heart. What though I promi&s;ed Mal-leon to u&s;e all my art to &s;eparate thee from thy protector, and to betray thee into the power of the Lord of Poictiers, yet I &s;corn the ba&s;e work of blood! I have u&s;ed my art, and with &s;ucce&s;s: I have &s;erved my country and my Chief, to who&s;e hand the laws of war, and thy fate con&s;ign thee, and to whom thou &s;halt be &s;oon re&s;tored by his friend Chauvigny.</P>
<P>I prepared to retort this in&s;olence, when the &s;ol|diers interrupted, and commanded me to attend them to Poictiers: whither we now bent our cour&s;e, the
<PB N="47" REF="46">wounded youth being &s;upported by the &s;oldiers, and followed by the &s;orrowful Jacqueline. But &s;carcely had we proceeded a few paces, when another and a larger body of armed men was di&s;covered, ru&s;hing precipitately acro&s;s the plain. My guards nothing doubting but that the&s;e were friends, took no pains to avoid their approach. As they poured down up|on us, their leader ca&s;t his eyes on me, and with plain marks of &s;urprize pronounced my name, when in&s;tantly the whole party fell with the utmo&s;t fury upon my guards. They in vain endeavoured to &s;up|port an unequal conte&s;t, encouraged by the voice and actions of D'Aumont, who fought with de&s;perate rage. Impatient to take a &s;hare in this encounter, I &s;uddenly &s;natched my &s;word from the &s;oldier who had &s;eized it, and flew upon my betrayer; but ere I could execute my ju&s;t vengeance, his fal&s;e heart was pierced by another arm. My guard were at length wholly overpowered: a few lay bleeding; the re&s;t yielded their arms and were made pri&s;oners, together with the wounded youth and his fair attendant al|mo&s;t expiring with terror and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And now I learned from my deliverers &s;ome part of that di&s;tre&s;s, in which I had involved the good Les Roches, and the danger which I had e&s;caped. Hear the &s;tory, as it was then, and afterwards un|folded, &s;till more clearly. The delay of our em|barkation from the i&s;le of Rh&egrave; had given the im|placable Mal-leon an opportunity of di&s;patching a me&s;&s;enger to Lord Chauvigny, by whom he accu&s;ed Les Roches, of practices again&s;t his government, and of wre&s;ting from him a pri&s;oner of &s;o much con|&s;equence as Sali&s;bury. This Lord, fired at the &s;uppo&s;ed injury offered to his friend, &s;eized the ca&s;|tle of Les Roches, with the too common violence of a neighbouring and more powerful Baron; and carried off his only daughter, as a pledge for my &s;urrender, if &s;till in the hands of Les Roches, or as a means of awakening my &s;en&s;e of honour and gratitude, and thus obliging me to return, if already di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Hence the grief and confu&s;ion of the
<PB N="48" REF="47">dome&s;ticks, at our arrival, and hence, the di&s;order of my friend: who, dreading my impetuo&s;ity and well remembering how ra&s;hly I had re&s;olved to deliver my&s;elf to Count Mal-leon, in order to gain his liberty, determined to conceal from me the cau&s;e of this di&s;order, and to try what might be effected by force of arms for the re&s;cue of his daughter. D'Aumont, with whom he con&s;ult|ed, and to whom he &s;poke his fears of my precipi|tate genero&s;ity, commended his re&s;olution; and at he prepared for immediate departure in order to col|lect his force, the fal&s;e Frenchman propo&s;ed, that to him&s;elf &s;hould be committed the care of prevent|ing me from leaving the ca&s;tle, in his ab&s;ence How he abu&s;ed this tru&s;t, thou haft already heard: but heaven was plea&s;ed to make his treachery the means of my pre&s;ervation. Chauvigny who was &s;till further informed of our approach, and of the weakne&s;s of our retinue, determined to make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter both of mine, and of the per&s;on of my friend: and no &s;ooner had I departed from the ca&s;|tle, under the conduct of my perfidious guide, than it was again &s;eized by a force detached for that purpo&s;e, whil&s;t another body ha&s;tening to &s;up|port their a&s;&s;ociates, accidentally encountred Les Roches, di&s;per&s;ed his followers, and were only pre|vented from &s;eizing him by the de&s;perate valour of my &s;even Engli&s;hmen, who&s;e attendance he had re|quired, and who now with difficulty &s;ecured his re|treat. A number of his followers thus di&s;per&s;ed, fled with precipitate ha&s;te towards their private haunts, for pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, and to collect new force for the deliverance of their chief: and in their flight, proved my deliverers.</P>
<P>They now &s;ubmitted to my direction, and in|vited me to &s;hare their fortune; and by my per&s;ua|&s;ion they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;oldiers of Chauvigny, toge|ther with his wounded &s;on. I embraced the youth at his departure, who &s;eemed confounded and a&s;hamed at the violence with which his father pur|&s;ued a &s;tranger thus &s;uperior to revenge. His eyes
<PB N="49" REF="48">were turned on Jacqueline, who&s;e looks and tears expre&s;&s;ed all the angui&s;h of &s;eparation. But the daughter of my deare&s;t friend was a trea&s;ure not to be entru&s;ted to the mercy of an enemy; and &s;he was therefore detained however reluctant. My deli|verers, anxious for our &s;ecurity, conveyed us with rapid &s;peed to the fa&s;tne&s;s of an high and dreary mountain, where an humble cottage received, and the kind offices of hone&s;t poverty relieved us. And here, this maid, who&s;e beauty created love and re|verence in the brea&s;t of every beholder, informed me freely of her dangers and di&s;tre&s;s. Soon as &s;he had been conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Poictiers, the young Chauvigny already no &s;tranger to the charms of Jacqueline, vi&s;ited the fair pri&s;oner, and endea|voured to allay her &s;orrows. Beauty, when di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed, is doubly powerful; and when pity unites with love, no heart can re&s;i&s;t their impre&s;&s;ion. This the youth experienced. His &s;oul became to|tally &s;ubdued; nor could he conceal the generous weakne&s;s. He pleaded, in all the mo&s;t affecting accents of a &s;incere and ardent pa&s;&s;ion: nor did he plead in vain. The maid, too &s;u&s;ceptible of tender|ne&s;s, and too artle&s;s to conceal her &s;en&s;ibility, heard him with indulgence, approved his worth, nor frowned on his love. Yet &s;till a greatne&s;s and ele|vation of &s;oul, gave dignity to her female &s;oftne&s;s. She demanded a &s;trong, and to a lover a &s;evere, proof of his &s;incerity. Re&s;tore me to my father, &s;aid &s;he, then &s;peak thy pa&s;&s;ion. He entreated, wept, and conjured; &s;he an&s;wered as before: till at length, the youth con&s;ented to the painful ta&s;k of ap|proving his &s;incerity, by parting with the dear object of his pa&s;&s;ion. A habit was provided to conceal the maid: and at the appointed hour, when guards had been bribed, and &s;u&s;picion lulled to &s;leep, &s;he i&s;&s;ued forth, under the conduct of her lover, and directed her eager &s;teps towards her father's ca&s;tle. And fatal had been the end of this ra&s;h de&s;ign, had not heaven wonderfully inter|po&s;ed. They had advanced con&s;iderably in their
<PB N="50" REF="49">progre&s;s, filled with gay hopes, and in&s;en&s;ible to danger, when &s;ome lawle&s;s rovers of the night, ar|re&s;ted, and began to rifle them. The young Lord patiently &s;ubmitted to their depredations; but alarm|ed for his dear companion, and anxious to conceal the &s;ecret of her &s;ex from brutal violence, he called upon them to &s;pare the page, and with loud denun|ciations of vengeance, wildly a&s;&s;ailed the wretch who was preparing to &s;trip his Jacqueline. A &s;ud|den wound laid him on the earth; the fore&s;t echoed with the &s;hrieks of the di&s;tracted maid; and in that moment the &s;oldiers &s;ent in pur&s;uit of them (for their departure was not long concealed) happily appeared in view, and drove the robbers from their prey.</P>

<P>I Adored the pre&s;erving hand of heaven, who&s;e influence had appeared &s;o evidently in the&s;e events. The treachery of D'Aumont in &s;eeking to de&s;troy me, had opportunely conveyed me from the power of my enemies. The violence and oppre&s;&s;ion of Chauvigny, had proved the means of &s;ending me deliverers, when fortune &s;eemed mo&s;t to frown upon me: and of giving up his own &s;on to my mercy. I was now at liberty, if an ob&s;cure and comfortle&s;s retreat could de&s;erve that name: I had delivered an helple&s;s maid, the dear child and precious trea|&s;ure of my friend, from the power of an oppre&s;&s;or: I was attended by hone&s;t and faithful followers, re&s;olute to protect, and zealous to oblige me: yet &s;till my &s;oul was anxious for the fortune of the kind and generous Les Roches, who&s;e virtues &s;eemed to have drawn down ruin upon his injured head. Some emi&s;&s;aries I &s;ent forth from time to time, to learn his fate: but no intelligence of his &s;ituation could be obtained. His ca&s;tle was de&s;erted, his friends di&s;per&s;ed, he him&s;elf lo&s;t in &s;ome ob&s;cure retirement with my gallant Engli&s;hmen, or perhaps
<PB N="51" REF="50">&s;lain by the malice of his pur&s;uers. The proud Lord of Poictiers had in the name of his prince (unwarrantably a&s;&s;umed to &s;upport his oppre&s;&s;ion) proclaimed him a traytor; and denounced death again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Such was the rage and malice of di&s;appointed pride.</P>
<P>I joined my tears with tho&s;e of the charming Jac|queline at the&s;e afflicting tidings. Weeks and months pa&s;&s;ed away in the tortures of anxious uncer|tainty. Tho' carele&s;s of my own fate, yet I felt the tendere&s;t concern for my dear charge; whom I conducted from one retreat to another, as the alarm of danger drove us forward, or the advice of our followers directed. My cares had now taught her to love me, as a parent and pre&s;erver: and the magnanimity which &s;he di&s;covered amid&s;t all her dangers and difficulties, commanded my re|&s;pect and admiration. She endured fatigue not only with chearfulne&s;s, but joy; and as if from her in|fant years inured to poverty and hard&s;hips, &s;he &s;eem|ed to have retained no memory of the ea&s;e and &s;oft|ne&s;s of pro&s;perity; nor did the tear ever &s;tart from her eye, but at the recollection of her father. A cou|rage above her &s;ex, and a &s;urprizing recollection and command of thought much beyond her years, never once de&s;erted her, in the mo&s;t trying moments: &s;o that, whoever beheld her manly garb, and ob&s;erved her determined &s;pirit, mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed that I was attended by a youth, not yet initiated in arms, but eagerly ambitious to become a &s;oldier, and impatient to enter on the cour&s;e of gallant action and renown. She it was who fir&s;t propo&s;ed the de&s;ign of quitting the&s;e ignoble retreats, and endea|vouring to find her father, now, when time had abated the ardor of our enemy's pur&s;uit; and &s;he too &s;ugge&s;ted the di&s;gui&s;e which effectually con|cealed us from jealou&s;y and malice. By the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of our faithful adherents, the habit of a Palmer was provided for each: and thus accou|tred, we ventured forth from our retreat; I, the fa|ther;
<PB N="52" REF="51">&s;he, the blooming &s;on; whil&s;t a few zealous and humble friends, them&s;elves di&s;gui&s;ed, watched our &s;teps at &s;ome di&s;tance, and waited to repel our dangers. Long time we journied on, and often were we indebted to the kind offices of charity, un|di&s;covered and un&s;u&s;pected. Often times have I gratified the curious pea&s;ant, who&s;e ho&s;pitable door was opened for our reception, with the recital of hardy deeds atchieved by his noble countrymen when the chri&s;tian powers united again&s;t the infidel: and oftentimes have I repeated my tale, to gain his con|fidence, and to lead him to &s;ome di&s;coveries that might direct me to my friend. But never could we receive the lea&s;t information of Les Roches, or of his fortunes. Oblivion &s;eemed to have involved him in her gloomy &s;hades, de&s;erted, abandoned, and forgotten by his unkind, ungrateful country|men; yet ever and anon, the remembrance of his goodne&s;s, and the thought of tho&s;e calamities in which I had involved him, recurred to torment my &s;oul: nor was the melancholy idea ever ab&s;ent from the mind of Jacqueline.</P>
<P>Our excur&s;ions were prolonged to a tedious and oppre&s;&s;ing length. Sometimes the heavy hand of fatigue and languor pre&s;&s;ed &s;ore upon my dear com|panion, and called for all my care and tenderne&s;s: and the&s;e were again amply repaid, when the vio|lent and complicated griefs that preyed upon my heart threatened me with &s;ome heavy malady. Thus wandering on, and wearied in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch, chance rather than our own determination led us to the &s;ea coa&s;t, where the wide extended &s;cene di&s;played before me, awakened all my eager wi&s;her to revi&s;it England. Oftentimes did I ca&s;t my eyes forward toward that &s;eat of honour and &s;ecurity, and as oft did they turn back on France, as if in &s;earch of my dear and injured friend. Not my own fortunes only were now the object of my thoughts: Jacqueline, the child of my pre&s;erver, the partner of his &s;orrows and his &s;ufferings, demanded a &s;hare in my &s;olicitude. I had &s;till gold to bribe the &s;ailor
<PB N="53" REF="52">to convey us to a harbour of &s;afety. I could not bear the thought of leaving this precious pledge of friend&s;hip to the care of poor and helple&s;s follow|ers; and yet my &s;oul was pained, when I made an effort to per&s;uade her to &s;eek refuge in an unknown country, and to re&s;ign her la&s;t faint hopes of em|bracing a beloved parent. Here all my addre&s;s was employed, and every flattering &s;ugge&s;tion urged to quiet her anxiety. All our di&s;appointed enquiries I converted into arguments of the caution and vigi|lance of Les Roches, which mu&s;t have effectually concealed him from the malice of his pur&s;uers. I &s;poke of my own influence in the Engli&s;h court, of the military power I could command: and conjured her to re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that nothing was wanting for his protection but my appearance in England: that there I could command authority and power &s;uf|ficient to &s;upport his rights, and redre&s;s his injuries. Her great &s;oul was animated with new vigour and re&s;olution at the thoughts of redre&s;s: and with a firmne&s;s which would have done honour to the bolder &s;ex, &s;he freely con&s;ented to &s;ubmit to my direction, and declared her&s;elf ready to attend me.</P>
<P>Our two followers, who&s;e unwearied zeal had not yet lo&s;t &s;ight of us, were now employed to pro|cure a ve&s;&s;el to convey us from the land of dan|ger and oppre&s;&s;ion: as two pilgrims, engaged by &s;olemn vows to vi&s;it the lately erected &s;hrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury; the &s;ame of which had not been confined to England. Some days pa&s;t in expectation of their &s;ucce&s;s, an interval which was employed in comforting my fair charge, and con|firming her re&s;olution. On the morning of a vernal day, we wandered forth from the charitable cot|tage, that lately had received us, to indulge our gentle conference without fear or controul. The &s;un was climbing to his meridian height, and warned us to repo&s;e under the &s;hade of a &s;teeply ri&s;ing hill, who&s;e trees nodded over us, and embrowned the neighbouring plain. Here we had not long re|clined, when the noi&s;e of jocund mirth &s;truck our
<PB N="54" REF="53">ears, and called our attention to two travellers, who lay at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;haring their friendly meal. I &s;tarted, and li&s;tened to the well known &s;ounds; I heard my own native lays, &s;weetly rehear&s;ing the renowned deeds of Arthur valiant prince, the an|tient wars of Ambro&s;e the Armoric knight, and the triumphs of Briti&s;h valour. I melted into tears, (&s;uch are the tender emotions which the love of country rai&s;es in our brea&s;ts) then ru&s;hing impetu|ou&s;ly towards the travellers, I gazed on them with a&s;toni&s;hment; they &s;prung from the ground, no le&s;s &s;urprized, and I embraced two of my dear country|men, and late companions. They &s;urveyed me with joy and wonder, they acquainted me that their fellows were at hand; they a&s;ked by what miracle I had been pre&s;erved; but I at once &s;topped their enquiries by demanding to know the fate of Les Roches. Their cold and mournful looks at the mention of this name, chilled the blood of Jacque|line, who had by this time joyned us. 'Say, &s;aid &s;he, in breathle&s;s agitation, 'when, how, where did Les Roches peri&s;h? Could not his followers defend him? Or did they de&s;ert him? Perfidious men! Where were their coward &s;words, when the malice of his per&s;ecutors tore his poor helple&s;s body? No faithful friend to defend him? No charitable hand to clo&s;e his dying eyes?' Here a flood of tears broke forth, while my countrymen wondered at her emotion: and eager to remove her &s;u&s;picions, de|clared, that Les Roches had wanted neither fidelity nor courage to defend him.' 'Lives he? cried the maid; 'where? lead me to him!' And again re&s;igned her&s;elf to &s;orrow, when the Engli&s;hmen declared that they were &s;trangers to his fate, nor knew his place of re&s;idence if yet alive. I interpo&s;ed to moderate her pa&s;&s;ion; then turning to my friends, demanded the full relation of their fortunes, &s;ince treachery and oppre&s;&s;ion had la&s;t torn us from each other.</P>
<P>They had been per&s;uaded, (as I now learned) that I mu&s;t have been &s;eized in the ca&s;tle, and
<PB N="55" REF="54">that I now lay under the &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ion of captivity; as Les Roches had in&s;tantly acquainted them with the &s;ecret of his daughter's being con|veyed to Poictiers, with his apprehen&s;ions of my pre|cipitate zeal, and the mea&s;ures he had taken to prevent any ra&s;h purpo&s;e of throwing my&s;elf into the hands of my pur&s;uers. They had attended him in his &s;udden excur&s;ion to collect his forces, and in the gallant act of defending him, they had been particularly animated by Fitz-Alan, the man who&s;e incon&s;iderate error had fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed my name in the i&s;le of Rh&egrave;, and who now fought with redoubled &s;ury, to atone for his fatal imprudence. He it was who, when Les Roches lay &s;urrounded and di&s;armed, hewed his way thro' unequal num|bers, and led the brave Engli&s;hmen to his re&s;cue. They took their cour&s;e from his direction, and conveyed him to the neighbouring hills, where &s;ecret and unvi&s;ited retreats received him, and where the vigilance and bravery of his followers guarded again&s;t the approach of frand and violence. His own countrymen, awed by the denunciations of Chauvigny, de&s;erted their unhappy chief, the help|le&s;s and abandoned victim of fatigue and want. The woods &s;upplied his nouri&s;hment; the naked turf received his devoted head, whil&s;t the &s;idelity and affection of his a&s;&s;ociates watched his broken &s;lumbers. Long time had they attended him from one retreat to another, thro' a &s;eries of uniform di&s;tre&s;s, without any new or extraordinary change of fortune; 'till on one fatal morning, they who&s;e indu&s;try bad been employed in hunting for food, and they who had the charge of watching near his humble couch, were &s;truck with confu&s;ion and &s;ur|prize, when they came to &s;eek their leader. He had &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, nor could their mo&s;t diligent enquiries learn his new re&s;idence, or inform them of his fate. And now, impatient of their &s;ituation, and determined rather to yield them&s;elves into the hands of their enemies, than to wa&s;te a tedious life in di&s;tre&s;sful and u&s;ele&s;s retirement, they
<PB N="56" REF="55">de&s;cended from their mountains, and boldly adven|tured into more known and more frequented paths. Here they &s;oon found that the hopes of regaining England were not yet to be re&s;igned. Pur&s;uit and difficulty had cea&s;ed: they pa&s;&s;ed on unnoticed and unmole&s;ted, and at length gained the coa&s;t, where we were now all happily a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el lay ready to receive us; we em|barqued with joy; yet &s;till cautious to guard again&s;t malice and ho&s;tility, I continued my di&s;gui&s;e. The winds were long unfavourable; and frequently were our &s;ouls terrified with the mo&s;t alarming menaces of de&s;truction. Twice did I embrace my lovely charge, in firm per&s;ua&s;ion that I had taken my la&s;t and final farewel; and that the approaching hour mu&s;t have con&s;igned us to one general ruin. Yet &s;till the holy &s;aints denied not their protection. Courage and vigour unabated, &s;ucce&s;sfully con|tended again&s;t the angry elements. Hara&s;&s;ed, wa&s;ted, and oppre&s;&s;ed with toil, we at length gain|ed the cheering pro&s;pect of our dear native &s;hore. Here out &s;hattered ve&s;&s;el happily arrived; and here we repo&s;e our wearied limbs under your ho&s;pitable protection.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl cea&s;ed; and Randolph, who had li&s;tened with exact attention, pau&s;ed for a mo|ment, in thoughtful &s;ilence, rai&s;ed his eyes and hands to heaven, in rapturous admiration, and grateful ac|knowledgement of that power which had hitherto conducted his friend &s;afely through this variety of peril and di&s;tre&s;s; then freely exclaimed at the envy of Mal-leon, the tyranny of Chauvigny, and the treachery of D'Aumont, with all the zeal of generous indignation and abhorrence. His tears con|fe&s;&s;ed that pity with which he thought on the cruel &s;ate of Les Roches, and infected the Earl with a ren|der emotion of grief for the misfortunes of his dear peril and di&s;tre&s;s; then freely exclaimed at the envy of Mal-leon, the tyranny of Chauvigny, and
<PB N="57" REF="56">friend and protector. He had not entertained the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion but that his own misfortunes were now compleatly ended; that any thing more remained, but to repair to his ca&s;tle, and comfort his &s;olitary Counte&s;s; yet now, when re&s;tored to a degree of tranquillity, he again offered at &s;ome enquiries on his part, of his hou&s;e, his &s;on and wife, but was in|&s;tantly interrupted by Randolph, who reminded him of re&s;t. The night was far &s;pent: fatigue and &s;leep, which the agitation rai&s;ed by the recital of his adven|tures, had hitherto repelled, now re&s;umed their pow|er, and invaded him with double force. He retired, and at la&s;t enjoyed the comfort (to him long un|known) of peaceful and &s;ecure repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Age had made Randolph watchful. He ro&s;e be|fore the dawn; and was &s;oon joined by the attendants of Lord William, who advanced to greet their ho&s;t, and to acknowledge his generous cares. Their mutual &s;alutations were cordial, and affectionate; the Engli&s;hmen &s;eemed to have forgot their toils; lu&s;ty and &s;pirited they &s;tood accoutred, and pre|pared to meet their leader, earne&s;t to tender their &s;ervices, and impatient to accompany his progre&s;s. Nor did they long wait for the appearance of Lord William. He had &s;prung from his couch refre&s;hed and re&s;tored to life and vigour, and now came forth to embrace the companions of his labours, and to repeat his congratulations. 'My friends,' &s;aid Ran|dolph, 'bear with us for a moment. I have &s;ome|thing which demands the private attention of the Earl.&mdash;Yet&mdash;no&mdash;It need not be concealed from you. Your coun&s;els may a&s;&s;i&s;t us.' Thus &s;peaking, he led the way towards a private apart|ment, whither he was followed by the Earl and his companions, not without &s;ome degree of wonder and anxious expectation.</P>
<P>Randolph ca&s;t his eyes downwards for &s;ome mo|ments, and was &s;ilent: then turning them on Lord William, 'For what fortunes,' &s;aid he, 'this Earl is pre&s;erved, I know not: but tranquillity &s;eems yet to be removed to &s;ome di&s;tance from his gra&s;p:
<PB N="58" REF="57">&s;omething &s;till remains to exerci&s;e his &s;pirit. Ray|mond, nephew to that Hubert who&s;e councils govern our King, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his ca&s;tle. There, and through all it's di&s;trict, he governs with an ab&s;o|lute &s;way.'&mdash;'What! cried Sali&s;bury, 'is my pow|er er expired! Do I indeed live? Or have my rights been forfeited?&mdash;Where were my friends? Hath my Counte&s;s been ignominiou&s;ly driven out by the u&s;urper?' Is this the reward of my &s;ervices? &mdash; Randolph here repre&s;&s;ed his violence: and demanding a calm and patient attention, the Knight thus pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>We all know with what uncontrouled power Hubert rules in the court of England: how his &s;ubtile arts of in&s;inuation have penetrated into the inmo&s;t heart of our Henry; and now direct all it's motions and de&s;igns. Already too dangerous, he &s;eeks but to extend his influence and authority, and to heap wealth and honours on his family and dependents. The&s;e are his great purpo&s;es; and to the&s;e he &s;acrifices the reputation of his ma&s;ter, and the welfare of his country. To him was &s;oon con|veyed the fal&s;e intelligence, that Earl William and his Knights, &s;eparated from our fleet in the tem|pe&s;tuous tumult, had peri&s;hed in the deep. The King heard the tidings with kind concern, and paid the ju&s;t tribute of &s;orrow to his unhappy kin&s;man, and brave &s;oldier. The crafty Hubert a&s;&s;umed the &s;emblance of grief, whil&s;t his &s;oul was bu&s;y in con|triving the means of turning this event to his own intere&s;ted purpo&s;es. He &s;eized the ea&s;y and com|plying moment, when the King lay mo&s;t open to his influence: he repre&s;ented the clo&s;e alliance, in which Raymond his good nephew &s;tood to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury: he reminded him, that by the royal bounty, Lord William had ob|tained the heire&s;s of that hou&s;e with her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and urged that the &s;ame royal bounty ought now to confer this gift on him, whom nature &s;eemed to point out as the true inheritor. In a word, he a&s;k|ed this boon, that Raymond &s;hould be permitted to
<PB N="59" REF="58">wed the Counte&s;s, now &s;uppo&s;ed a widow, and to enjoy her ample fortunes and her honours.&mdash; 'Heavens!' exclaimed the Earl, this man admitted to her bed! &mdash; Am I &s;o &s;oon forgotten? What? not a few months of &s;orrow!&mdash;Think not hardly of the Counte&s;s, &s;aid Randolph; her dignity of &s;oul.&mdash;'Yes!' cried William again interrupting him, 'I know it.&mdash;It cannot be&mdash;proceed, and give me all tho&s;e &s;trange events.&mdash;'The King,' replied Randolph, granted his &s;uit without difficulty. Go, &s;aid he, command Raymond to prepare for his departure: let him &s;ummon all his addre&s;s and eloquence, to prevail upon the gentle Counte&s;s. No ea&s;y conque&s;t, &s;he; no common prize! My grace waits on her con&s;ent.&mdash;Con&s;ent! impo&s;&s;i|ble! cried Sali&s;bury; when Randolph again en|deavouring to allay the heat of his impatience, earne&s;tly united his intreaties with tho&s;e of the Earl's companions, and at length obtained a patient audi|ence.</P>
<P>Raymond, thus the old Knight proceeded, was not &s;low to accept this gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion to his wi&s;hes. Supported by the power of Hubert, enriched by his bounty, and attended by the flat|tering followers of his pro&s;perity, this Lord &s;oon prepared all nece&s;&s;aries for a magnificent and &s;tate|ly progre&s;s. He left the Engli&s;h court, which now graced the city of Marlborough with it's re&s;idence (for thither the indi&s;po&s;ition of our liege had cau&s;ed it to be transferred) and at the head of a gallant troop of Knights, armed, and capari&s;oned in all their courtly pride and &s;plendor, and implicitly obedient to their leader, he proceeded toward the ca&s;tle of Sa|li&s;bury. The humble villagers gazed on this gay troop, with &s;urprize and plea&s;ure, were &s;oon in|formed of their purpo&s;e, and &s;oon &s;pread the &s;tory through all the neighbouring land. The Counte&s;s had already learned the melancholy tidings of her Lord; and indulged her griefs in &s;ecret: when, rou&s;ed by the appearance of this retinue, and nothing &s;u&s;pecting the purpo&s;e of Raymond,
<PB N="60" REF="59">&s;he opened her gates wide to his approach, and re|ceived him and his attendants with all ho&s;pitable rites, befitting her own nobility, and the greatne&s;s of her gue&s;ts. To Raymond &s;he appeared in all the dignity of grief, holding her young &s;on, a fair copy of her beauty and her &s;orrow. And (if fame &s;peaks true) the charms of the maje&s;tic mourner, had, in that moment, too powerful an influence upon the heart of Raymond. Love came in aid of his ambition, and inflamed the ardor of his pur&s;uit. With all tho&s;e &s;oothing arts, which courts and their poli&s;h'd conver&s;e had be&s;towed, he laboured to di&s;pel her gloom, and cautiou&s;ly to introduce the great purpo&s;e of his arrival. Long time he &s;u&s;pended his declaration: (&s;uch is the controuling power of beauty, &s;urrounded by the awful beams of cha&s;te and graceful dignity) yet in every interview was his pa&s;&s;ion confirmed and encrea&s;ed. At length (&s;o have we been in|formed) he &s;poke his &s;uit with humble and anxious he&s;itation; and was received with &s;urprize and &s;cornful denial.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Knight thus &s;pake, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions had di&s;tracted the mind of Lord William. His eyes fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t and tu|multuous impatience. He trembled; and the blood retired from his cheeks; then ru&s;hed back to re|&s;ume it's &s;eat, with double force, and glowed with fiery indignation. Again, his tender looks declared, with what love and gratitude and &s;ympathizing pity, he felt the &s;orrows of his beloved Counte&s;s. Impa|tience and anxiety again &s;ucceeded; and when the Knight pau&s;ed, his looks had grown great, and elevated, and a &s;udden exclamation of triumph broke involuntarily from his lips. 'What remains,' &s;aid he, 'but that we now go and re&s;ume our authority? What is wanting but our pre&s;ence to relieve our Counte&s;s from this importunate wooer? Come, my friends! let us ha&s;te away. Let us break through that cloud of ob&s;curity which hath too long conceal|ed us: and confound the men who gra&s;p at our rights
<PB N="61" REF="60">and honours, with &s;uch a precipitate and ra&s;h pre|&s;umption. Shall Ela weep, and I delay to comfort her: Shall proud intru&s;ion break upon her privacy, and irritate her grief, and do I not fly to relieve her?' 'Beware,' replied the Knight with looks of &s;age and rigid caution, 'beware of violence! con&s;ult not with thy pa&s;&s;ions. Thy Counte&s;s hath, I hope, maintained her firmne&s;s and con&s;tant purpo&s;e to the la&s;t. Should &s;he&mdash;but I cannot fear it.&mdash;Yet &s;till Raymond is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thy ca&s;tle; he acts as Lord of thy land and inheritor of thy pow|er. Can&s;t thou behold this u&s;urpation calm and unmoved? Tru&s;t me, I dread thy impetuous re|&s;entment. Raymond is proud and in&s;olent; Hu|bert crafty, dark, and revengeful. The injurious never can forgive. Shame and di&s;appointment may drive him to de&s;perate re&s;olutions.&mdash;Alas, I can|not &s;peak half my fears.'</P>
<P>This my&s;terious language of the Knight, who, however he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his fear, really dreaded a fatal compliance in the Counte&s;s, and formed the mo&s;t terrible pre&s;ages of broils and blood, kindled up a &s;udden flame in the brea&s;t of Sali&s;bury. 'Heavens!' cried he, 'if Raymond &s;hould have already&mdash;'I &s;ee the danger of my &s;ituation.&mdash;But let us quickly &s;eek this invader.' Randolph now &s;eemed to condemn his own apprehen&s;ions, which he ob&s;erved might ari&s;e from doubtful or mi&s;taken information. His retirement had rendered him the more liable to be deceived; and de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing the return of his friend had made him le&s;s &s;olicitous in his enquiries. However, he &s;till urged caution and calm proce|dure. He advi&s;ed that &s;ome friends &s;hould be &s;ent forward to the ca&s;tle to declare the approach of Earl William. 'This,' &s;aid he, 'will give an opportunity to Raymond to retire, without the &s;hame of en|countring the &s;everity of his a&s;pect, who comes to drive him from his u&s;urped &s;tate, and without pro|voking thee to &s;ome ra&s;h deed of ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion. Then &s;hall we follow; and peace, joy, and conjugal affection &s;hall receive thee.' The
<PB N="62" REF="61">Earl approved his coun&s;el; and con&s;ented to the de&s;ires of his companions, who pre&s;&s;ed to be the har|bingers of his approach. They in&s;tantly took the&s;e way: whil&s;t Randolph di&s;patched his me&s;&s;engers to &s;ummon &s;uch a number of dependants as might afford an honourable conduct to the Earl, together with the fair Jacqueline, who now came forth not in her di&s;gui&s;e; but in a female garb, tho' not magnificent, yet better &s;uited to di&s;play her mode&s;t graces, and to give new lu&s;tre to her beauty. It was re&s;olved that for a few days they &s;hould continue with the ho&s;pita|ble Knight; an interval tedious and di&s;tracting to the Earl, who&s;e mind was filled with doubts and fears; impatient to know more than had already been re|ceived from the imperfect intelligence of his ho&s;t, yet dreading to hear &s;omething which might fatally wound his peace.</P>

<P>WHATEVER &s;adly-boding thoughts were entertained by Lord William, little did they corre&s;pond with that weight of angui&s;h, which, by this time, had oppre&s;&s;ed his wife; in who&s;e ca&s;tle, the in&s;olence and cruelty of Raymond and his creatures had taken their lawle&s;s cour&s;e, free from controul. His fir&s;t appearance had been courteous and gentle, befitting a noble vi&s;itant: nor did he di&s;clo&s;e his pur|po&s;e, till he had gained the fair opinion of the un&s;u&s;|pecting counte&s;s. Love and wedlock, when fir&s;t made his theme, &s;ounded like notes jarring and di&s;|cordant, to the ear exactly tuned to harmony: and when he urged his &s;uit directly, a &s;udden flood of tears confe&s;&s;ed her inward emotion, &s;uch tears as in|dignation and di&s;dain force from the eyes of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed greatne&s;s, and high-born pride. Raymond &s;tood a|mazed: and vain were his repeated endeavours to compo&s;e her di&s;order. At length, her pa&s;&s;ions thus found an utterance: <Q>And do&s;t thou know me? Ha&s;t thou ever heard that the greatne&s;s of &s;oul which hath invariably di&s;tingui&s;hed my long train of migh|ty ance&s;try, is lo&s;t in me?&mdash;One year hath not yet elap&s;ed, &s;ince the&s;e arms embraced my honoured lord. But had the grave long &s;ince received him; had time dried up my widows tears, thinke&s;t thou that the widow of a Plantagenet&mdash;But why talk I thus?&mdash;How knowe&s;t thou? What officious bab|ling &s;lave hath flattered thee with the lying &s;tory that Lord William lives no longer; that the great light of England is extingui&s;hed, and that Ray|mond may now ri&s;e and &s;hine?&mdash;It is fal&s;e&mdash;I will
<PB N="64" REF="63">not think it. Yet, yet will I hope for his return. Should he find thee here, (and this thy purpo&s;e!) what could defend Lord Raymoud from his re&s;ent|ment? Thou knowe&s;t the mighty &s;pirit Earl Wil|liam. Fly this moment; and tempt not thy fate. Nay, never frown! How would one &s;ingle glance of his princely eye confound that haughty confi|dence? Know, pre&s;uming lord, that the &s;lighte&s;t probability of his appearance &s;hould &s;trike thee with terror.</Q> Thus &s;aying, &s;he turned &s;cornfully away; lovely even in her di&s;dain; and &s;uddenly left her &s;ui|tor in wonder and confu&s;ion: who, too deeply affect|ed by her beauty, to &s;ubmit to this repul&s;e, &s;ollicited, entreated, and at length rather forced, than was ad|mitted to a &s;econd interview. Earne&s;tly did he urge his love, and with all the gentle eloquence of a &s;incere and ardent pa&s;&s;ion. Ju&s;t to the de&s;erts of of Earl Wil|liam, he acknowledged his high worth, and his own inferior merit: but the hopes of his return, he treated as de&s;perate and unrea&s;onable, and exerted all his art to bani&s;h from her thoughts the memory of a man, whom fate had long &s;ince buried in eternal oblivion. &mdash;'Behold this boy!' &s;aid the Counte&s;s, cla&s;ping her young &s;on: <Q>in him, at lea&s;t, Sali&s;bury &s;till lives. And never can his mourning wife re&s;ign the dear melancholy remmembrance of his greatne&s;s, while this precious pledge of former love, this lively image of a noble and honourable father, remains to &s;ooth her &s;orrow. Behold him, &s;ee how all the princely dignity of William already &s;its di&s;played in his youthful front: and wonder not that Ela never can de&s;cend to any other pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Thus ob&s;tinate and inexorable, the Counte&s;s ever added &s;corn and reproof to her denial; in&s;ulted the love, and &s;tung the pride of Raymond; who&s;e di&s;|grace was &s;oon no &s;ecret to his attendants. Of the&s;e, the fir&s;t, and principal in his confidence, was a man nurtured in courts; long practi&s;ed in the arts of flat|tery, and the homage of dependance; trained to watch the looks, the &s;miles, the frowns of a &s;uperior, to aid his plea&s;ures, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ions, to love,
<PB N="65" REF="64">to hate, as he directed, with an ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s equal|led only by the in&s;olence and oppre&s;&s;ion which he dealt out with unfeeling &s;everity to all beneath him. Subtile and expert he was in the arts of fraud and cir|cumvention; ever attentive to his own private inte|te&s;t; patient, per&s;evering, and &s;agacious in the means of advancing it. His name was Grey. To him Raymond unbo&s;omed his di&s;ordered thoughts; la|mented his de&s;pi&s;ed love, and the unrelenting pride of Ela, which threatened to bla&s;t all his hopes of ambi|tion. The flatterer expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t indignation; and as if the re&s;olution of the Counte&s;s had been un|warranted and injurious, injurious to the honour and dignity of Raymond, he cen&s;ured him with an artful &s;emblance of &s;incerity and zeal, as if he him&s;elf had been the cau&s;e of his own repul&s;e: He accu&s;ed him of indulging the perver&s;ene&s;s and pride of this high dame, by the humble and abject &s;train of his ad|dre&s;&s;es. He per&s;uaded him that in this place he was now ab&s;olute lord and inheritor, who &s;hould com|mand, and not intreat, graced as he was by the roy|al favour, and &s;upported by the power of Hubert. The &s;lighte&s;t hint was more than &s;ufficient to enflame the pride of Raymond. He yielded entirely to the plea&s;ing delu&s;ion, and already fancied him&s;elf un|doubted heir of the hou&s;e of Sal&s;bury, and ma&s;ter of its ample domain. The conditions on which the king had a&s;&s;ented to his petition, were totally forgotten: and he now determined to act agreeably to that high character, in which his imagination had arrayed him, and to extort that compliance to his wi&s;hes, which his &s;ollicitations could not obtain. Every thing was di&s;|po&s;ed at his command; and the dome&s;tics and in|habitants of the ca&s;tle taught to acknowledge a new lord. To the Counte&s;s, he affected to appear, not as an humble lover, but an imperious &s;overeign ma&s;ter. Yet, awed by her dignity and beauty, he acted this part, not without con&s;traint and &s;hame; and &s;till re|pul&s;ed, and &s;till de&s;pi&s;ed, he required all the artifice and flattery of Grey, to &s;uport him in his purpo&s;e. Yet, this extraordinary change could not fail to alarm
<PB N="66" REF="65">the fears of the Counte&s;s. With &s;urpri&s;e and helple&s;&s; indignation &s;he found her&s;elf the pri&s;oner of her gue&s;t. Her u&s;ual attendants were removed; and new dome&s;|tics a&s;&s;igned, the creatures of her enemy, who per|formed the due offices to her and to her infant &s;on, not without re&s;pect and care, but with &s;ullen &s;ilence and re&s;erve: and all her words and actions were free to the ob&s;ervation of &s;trange and unfriendly keepers. If Raymond ventured to appear in her pre&s;ence, (for &s;till he dreaded the &s;everity of her frown) with wild di&s;may, yet with the dignity of injured greatne&s;s, &s;he demanded an explanation of this my&s;terious conduct: whil&s;t he only urged the nece&s;&s;ity of an ab&s;olute com|pliance with his de&s;ires, and left her agitated &s;oul to divine the fatal con&s;equences of a refu&s;al. Sometimes &s;he endeavoured to expo&s;tulate; to &s;peak her wrongs boldly, and to menace her oppre&s;&s;ors; but tears never failed to betray her inward terror, and to di&s;cover a lively &s;en&s;e of the weakne&s;s of her widowed &s;tate. Sometimes &s;he called upon Lord William, and tor|mented her&s;elf with the remembrance of the virtues and renown of her lo&s;t protector. Sometimes &s;he pre&s;t her &s;on with an eager and pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s to her heart, and invoked every &s;aint in heaven to &s;ave the precious creature. For him much more anxious, than for her own fate, &s;he formed a thou&s;and vi&s;ionary &s;chemes to re&s;cue him from the oppre&s;&s;or; which like fanta&s;tical dreams, vani&s;hed, and left her to de&s;|pair. Raymond, though in&s;olent and cruel, yet &s;till loved the unhappy Counte&s;s; nor could he behold her di&s;tre&s;s without &s;ome pangs of remor&s;e. But his unrelenting minion was ever at hand, to condemn and deride his weakne&s;s, (&s;o he deemed it) and to per|&s;uade him that nothing but rigid authority and &s;evere re&s;traint could prevail upon the high mind of Ela, and reduce her to what his abandoned flattery pre|&s;umed to call a rea&s;onable compliance. Thus was her re&s;olution &s;till a&s;&s;ailed, and &s;till unconquered.</P>
<P>But greater trials remained for this unhappy lady, Grey, who&s;e mind was not di&s;compo&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ion, and who thought more coolly than his lord, &s;eriou&s;ly
<PB N="67" REF="66">reflected on the nece&s;&s;ity of forcing the Counte&s;s to give her hand to Raymond, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h his rightful claim to an inheritance, which promi&s;ed ample advantages to his creatures. And when the pro&s;pect of riches and rewards were pre&s;ented to his view, his rapacious &s;oul in&s;tantly became deaf to all the calls of pity; nor was one &s;entiment of humanity &s;uffered to intrude upon his mind. The enamoured Raymond grew more and more impatient; and every hour lamented the inflexible &s;pirit of the Counte&s;s, and her unalterable aver&s;ion to his love. His flatterer &s;till wore a face of friendly anxiety and concern; and, as if he lived only for his lord, &s;eemed to feel the di&s;appointment as his own misfortune: and expre&s;|&s;ed that earne&s;tne&s;s for conquering this difficulty, with which men generally pur&s;ue their private inte|re&s;ts. Raymond was charmed with this &s;pecious &s;hew of zeal and &s;incere affection. He called him friend, guardian, and director; he lavi&s;hly promi&s;ed wealth and honours; and entreated him to devi&s;e &s;ome means of accompli&s;hing his wi&s;hes. Grey &s;eemed for a while immer&s;ed in thought: then, as if &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he a&s;&s;umed a look of confidence and exultation. 'It cannot be!' thus he exclaimed: 'This imperious Counte&s;s cannot for ever prove in|&s;en&s;ible to the inviting voice of joy and happi|ne&s;s. She &s;ees thy pa&s;&s;ion; and would enflame it by this affected delay. Or if her haughty &s;oul be really unmoved, &s;omething mu&s;t be thought of&mdash; Raymond mu&s;t&mdash;yes, my ever honoured lord, thou &s;halt po&s;&s;e&s;s her. Let me be favoured with thy confidence: &s;ubmit to my direction. For &s;ome days &s;hun her pre&s;ence, for there thy weakne&s;s is di&s;|covered. Rely on my &s;ervices; and let it be my part to prevail upon her.'&mdash;'Go, &s;aid Raymond; 'to you and to your conduct I implicitly re&s;ign my hopes. Prevail, and be great as thou can&s;t wi&s;h.'&mdash;Thus was the afflicted Counte&s;s given up to the hands of in&s;olence and cruelty, without help or friend, without coun&s;el or re&s;ource.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">
In&s;tead of the man who&s;e arrogance was tempered by that reverence and love with which her beauty had in&s;pired him, Ela &s;aw now before her an unrelenting, unfeeling va&s;&s;al; in condition, &s;uch as her &s;oul di&s;|dained to hold conver&s;e with, and in temper ba&s;e and brutal. He approached her with a rude in&s;en&s;ibility to her &s;tate, and to her &s;orrows. In&s;tead of pleading the pa&s;&s;ion, or the merits of his ma&s;ter, he proudly demanded her compliance. He called upon her to con&s;ider his power, and her own condition: that &s;he was no longer mi&s;tre&s;s in this &s;tately ca&s;tle, which, with all its wide extended lands, had devolved to Raymond; now the ma&s;ter even of her and of her &s;on; and that &s;he had only to chu&s;e whether to ap|pear as his con&s;ort, in all the lu&s;tre that riches and royal favour can be&s;tow, or to wa&s;te her &s;olitary days in grief and abject dependance.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, though pierced with &s;orrow, and &s;en&s;ible of her helple&s;s condition, &s;urveyed the rude minion in di&s;dainful &s;ilence. He repeated his bold remon&s;trances; yet nothing more could his importu|nities extort, than a &s;tern command to retire from her pre&s;ence. He obeyed: but &s;oon returned, and repeat|ed his odious in&s;olence. In that moment her young &s;on appeared, and flew with eager and fond care&s;&s;es to his mother. At &s;ight of him, &s;he in&s;tantly forgot her greatne&s;s: her griefs bur&s;t forth in a &s;udden and violent &s;tream. She embraced him with trembling arms: and the boy, though unable to conceive the cau&s;e, &s;ympathized pa&s;&s;ionately with the Counte&s;s. The &s;ight was pitiful and affecting; but the hardened Grey felt only a &s;hort and tran&s;ient &s;urpri&s;e. 'Is he thus dear!' &s;aid he: 'know then, that his mother's ob&s;tinacy may prove fatal to her &s;on. The charge of him now belongs to Raymond. He be&s;t knows how to defeat all future attempts to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his rights.'&mdash;The Counte&s;s &s;tarted up in &s;peech|le&s;s amazement: and Grey turned from her with a &s;ullen menace, that henceforward her &s;on &s;hould be a &s;tranger to her arms. 'Stay!' replied the Counte&s;s, pale and trembling with terror and virtuous anger:
<PB N="69" REF="68"><Q>hear me, cruel man&mdash;Heavens! is it for this that we are made pri&s;oners within our own walls; &s;hut up from &s;ociety and relief? no acce&s;s for comfort or friend&s;hip; no re&s;ource, no &s;upport for our helple&s;s innocence? And did the bloody purpo&s;e of a murder|er lurk beneath his courtly &s;miles, when Lord Ray|mond fir&s;t entered our ca&s;tle? And dreads he not vengeance? Have the friends of William all peri&s;h|ed with him?&mdash;At lea&s;t Heaven is our friend; and will repay the cruel deed. O! there is a ble&s;&s;ed angel ever ready to pre&s;ent the cries of infant inno|cence before the throne of ju&s;tice, and to implore for vengeance on the arm that hath been lifted again&s;t it.&mdash;Seeks he our love? Mi&s;taken lord! little do&s;t thou conceive the fatal con&s;equences of extorting a feigned con&s;ent, when the heart is &s;till e&s;tranged. Cold indifference, di&s;ta&s;te, aver&s;ion, and loathing, ever watch round the bridal bed, and fright away all joy and &s;ocial comforts&mdash;Seeks he our po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions? &mdash;Take them! enjoy them freely! and let us retire to &s;ome &s;eat of humble ob&s;curity; where no curious eye &s;hall ever pierce through our rece&s;s; where the name of Sali&s;bury was never known or uttered by the voice of Fame. There &s;hall my child labour with the lowly pea&s;ant: and never &s;hall his mother betray the &s;ecret of his birth. But if his blood mu&s;t be the horrid purcha&s;e&mdash;O let Ray|mond &s;ecure his power and riches beyond the reach of time or fortune. Let me too peri&s;h. Drive not all mercy from your hearts: but &s;pare me the dreadful &s;ight of my child's blood. No! let me be made the fir&s;t victim of your cruelty.</Q></P>
<P>Pity and humanity for a moment a&s;&s;ailed the ruth|le&s;s heart of Grey; but &s;oon were they repelled. He &s;ternly an&s;wered, that &s;he and her &s;on might yet be happy; that the conditions were ea&s;y and honourable: but that di&s;dain and pride were no good proofs of a mother's tenderne&s;s: that the fortune of this boy was in her power, and that &s;hould he &s;uffer, &s;he her&s;elf would be the author of his &s;ufferings.&mdash;Then call|ing the attendants, he commanded them to remove
<PB N="70" REF="69">young William. His mother fell upon her knees, &s;tretching out her trembling arms in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence: To her bo&s;om the boy fled for refuge from his infant terrors; &s;he ro&s;e, and cla&s;ped him to her brea&s;t, de|vouring the dear object with eyes of frantic fondne&s;s. The mini&s;ters of cruelty relented and he&s;itated: but Grey &s;everely repeated his command. They &s;ur|rounded the di&s;tracted mother and her weeping &s;on; &s;oon conquered her feeble efforts to detain him, and tore him from her &s;truggling gra&s;p. Her &s;hrieks echo|ed through the ca&s;tle, and wounded the affrighted ear: till nature, hara&s;&s;ed and exhau&s;ted by contending with the va&s;t affliction, lo&s;t its powers, and the Counte&s;s lay pale and lifele&s;s upon the ground. The tumult in her apartment had already reached the ear of Ray|mond, who flew to enquire the cau&s;e, and now came to be a witne&s;s of her di&s;tre&s;s. He &s;oon learned the cau&s;e, and far from approving the cruelty of his minion, he received him with frowns and reproof. He ordered the female attendants to convey their afflicted lady to her couch, and with all tender cares to recall her dying &s;en&s;es. Thither he him&s;elf &s;oon followed, to re&s;tore her dear &s;on, and to calm her ter|rors: but &s;he now had no ear for comfort. The fever had already &s;eized upon her; enflamed her eye, and raged in her boiling veins. Her di&s;ordered fancy tormented her with killing images of terror; and his pre&s;ence added new force to her delirium. Ray|mond felt all the violence of love and di&s;traction: and Grey &s;tood agha&s;t. This &s;ubtile minion labour|ed, fir&s;t, to appea&s;e the re&s;entment of his lord, and then to give him comfort. He him&s;elf appeared mo&s;t &s;ollicitous for the recovery of the Counte&s;s, although his wicked heart &s;ecretly exulted in her pre&s;ent dan|ger. Should &s;he live, and at length con&s;ent to accept of Raymond for a hu&s;band, his in&s;olence mu&s;t then be remembered, and his lord taught to dete&s;t the author of her &s;ufferings. Should &s;he &s;till refu&s;e to give her hand to Raymond, this lord could not long continue his oppre&s;&s;ion, but mu&s;t &s;oon re&s;ign his un|ju&s;t preten&s;ions, and thus da&s;h all his own hopes of
<PB N="71" REF="70">rich rewards. Nay, po&s;&s;ibly his conduct might here|after meet a &s;evere puni&s;hment. Thus he rea&s;oned: and regarded her death as an event highly to be wi&s;h|ed. An infant heir might ea&s;ily be di&s;po&s;ed of, and Raymond inve&s;ted with his rights without controul or oppo&s;ition. Every hour flattered his hopes with de&s;perate accounts of Ela and her alarming &s;ituation. His art was exerted to the utmo&s;t, to divert the atten|tion of Raymond from her di&s;tre&s;s, to alienate his mind from a woman who had pre&s;umptuou&s;ly in&s;uited his pa&s;&s;ion; and to dazzle him with the gay view of tho&s;e fortunes which were now ready to crown his wi&s;hes. To inflame the pride of this lord, was his artifice and flattery principally directed. And, when he had warmed his imagination with pro&s;pects of riches and magnificence: when he had worked up his pliant mind to the due pitch of in&s;olence and fiercene&s;s, he even dared to hint at the nece&s;&s;ity of defeating all future claims; and with hardened calm|ne&s;s and indifference declared, that it mu&s;t be his own care prudently and &s;ecretly to di&s;po&s;e of young Wil|liam. Nor did Raymond, in his pre&s;ent temper, hear him with abhorrence or emotion. To &s;uch in|con&s;i&s;tencies is the mind of man hurried by the ty|ranny of pa&s;&s;ions. He had ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t pity for the Counte&s;s; and now, when the determin|ed villain had propo&s;ed to de&s;troy her infant &s;on, he &s;tarted not at the horrid council, nor refu&s;ed his con|&s;ent.</P>

<P>BUT that pity which pride and intere&s;ted cruelty denied her, Ela found now in her own &s;ex. Her principal female attendant, though the creature of Raymond, and by him appointed for her &s;ervice, had long beheld her &s;orrows and maternal fondne&s;s, with &s;ecret grief and &s;ympathy. She had, her&s;elf, been wife and mother, had long felt and known their endearments and cares. Long had &s;he wept in &s;ecret
<PB N="72" REF="71">for the afflictions of her injured lady, and now attend|ed on her &s;ick couch, with all the fond zeal and con|cern, which a woman's di&s;tre&s;s could excite in the gentle and feeling mind of woman. Her affection was now undi&s;&s;embled (for her Lord enjoined the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous care, when the di&s;order had fir&s;t &s;eized the Counte&s;s:) and that affection was attended with &s;ucce&s;s, proportioned to it's ardor and &s;incerity. Not time nor fatigue could abate her diligence and kind attention to a beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, who long lay in&s;en&s;i|ble of her goodne&s;s, &s;hrinking timorou&s;ly from the hand that pre&s;ented relief. At length, however, na|ture appeared &s;till unconquered in this &s;evere conflict, Rea&s;on began gradually to regain it's native &s;eat, and the Counte&s;s was re&s;tored to &s;ome compo&s;ure. Elinor (&s;o was her attendant called) watched the happy mo|ment, when &s;he began to &s;urvey the objects round her without di&s;traction, to offer comfort and con&s;olation. She pre&s;ented her &s;on, who &s;tood weeping by her &s;ide, to a&s;&s;ure her of his &s;ecurity; and every office which duty and charity could dictate, &s;he bu&s;ily per|formed to allay the violence of her malady, and to re&s;tore her languid &s;pirit. The Counte&s;s, touched with her goodne&s;s, repaid her with the warme&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ions of regard and gratitude. Their affection was now mutual, and was &s;ucceeded by mutual con|&s;idence. Thus, even among&s;t it's enemies, did op|pre&s;&s;ed virtue &s;o far prevail, as to reconcile one mind, and to attach one relenting heart, to it's injured cau&s;e. Ela every hour experienced the happy effects of ten|der care. She had recovered &s;ome degree of ea&s;e and &s;trength: &s;he had lei&s;ure to reflect upon her danger and difficulties: misfortune and &s;olitude had effaced the proud thoughts of rank and greatne&s;s: and without re&s;erve &s;he opened her &s;oul to this attendant; bitterly lamenting the &s;everity of her fate; who, tho' &s;he num|bered many and powerful friends, tho' her fortune and condition gave her the command of a formidable band of va&s;&s;als, yet by foul treachery was cut off from all relief, from all po&s;&s;ibility of complaining, or petitioning for deliverance, &s;ubjected to the will
<PB N="73" REF="72">of in&s;olent and cruel enemies, and expo&s;ed to all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of captivity, in that very place, where &s;he was rightful mi&s;tre&s;s: &s;trange reward for the &s;ervices of her great father, and her noble hu&s;band! The attendant with ardent prayers, and lively effu&s;i|ons of pity and tenderne&s;s, gave her &s;ome &s;light con&s;olation; but tho' &s;he felt for her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;eemed incapable of devi&s;ing any rea&s;onable means of relief. Hope, patience, and &s;uch like terms, which found but har&s;hly in the ear of affliction, &s;he repeated with a warm but impotent zeal; &s;he even ventured to hint at the expediency of a&s;&s;uming an appearance of le&s;s &s;everity to Lord Raymond; of flattering his fond expectations for a while: thus, to amu&s;e the bu&s;y and contriving malice of his creature, to gain &s;ome interval of ea&s;e, &s;ome happy re&s;pite from per|&s;ecution. Time and the interpo&s;ition of heaven might then work wonderfully for her deliverance. But the &s;oul of Ela &s;till retained a dignity &s;uperior to the arts of di&s;&s;imulation. She &s;tarted with ab|horrence, at the thought of &s;ullying her bright &s;ame by any &s;u&s;picious conduct, any &s;emblance of un|worthy conde&s;cen&s;ion. Her high mind dwelt with more plea&s;ure on the flattering thoughts of redre&s;s and vengeance. She reflected that the land &s;till con|tained many powerful friends to her lo&s;t hu&s;band, and to her noble hou&s;e; &s;he hoped that nothing was nece&s;&s;ary for her deliverance, and for the puni&s;hment of her oppre&s;&s;ors, but to inform them of her dan|gerous and di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e thoughts, &s;he conceived the bold de&s;ign of eluding the vigilance of Raymond, and of e&s;caping to a religious hou&s;e: there to take &s;anctuary with her infant &s;on, from thence to repre&s;ent to the King, the cruel in&s;ult offered to the memory of his kin&s;man and faithful &s;oldier, and to demand redre&s;s of his and her own wrongs from the ju&s;tice of the throne, and the power of her friends. She took no pains to conceal the&s;e &s;entiments; but freely communicated the de&s;ign to Elinor and entreated her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She enlarged on the power and opportunities of rewarding her
<PB N="74" REF="73">fidelity, which &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t give her: &s;he lavi&s;hly poured out gold and jewels. <Q>Go, &s;aid &s;he, find among the dependants of this proud Lord, if there be courage and humanity in any brea&s;t to favour a virtuous de&s;ign. Here are rewards! a &s;mall portion and but an earne&s;t of that munificence with which my gratitude &s;hall repay the benefit.</Q> The attendant at fir&s;t &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at the boldne&s;s of the attempt: whil&s;t the Counte&s;s renewed her &s;ollicita|tions, a new and &s;udden thought &s;eemed to &s;tart to life within her mind: but before &s;he could give it utterance, their conver&s;ation was interrupted; and Elinor commanded to attend in&s;tantly on Lord Ray|mond. She departed with a look, which a&s;&s;ured the Counte&s;s of her unalterable attachment; but did not entirely di&s;&s;ipate her terrors. The&s;e were in&s;tantly awakened at the alarm of every thing new and un|expected.</P>
<P>A long interval of &s;u&s;pence encrea&s;ed her anxiety: at length however the faithful attendant returned, and with a chearful a&s;pect, 'Deare&s;t Lady,' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>the ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints &s;eem to encourage us to the bold attempt of e&s;caping from the&s;e walls, Lord Ray|mond hath appointed his Knights to make ready in three days, to accompany him to the neighbouring woods; there, to pur&s;ue the cha&s;e. He hath en|quired of your health: and is per&s;uaded that you continue ill at ea&s;e. He hath enjoined the exacte&s;t care and vigilance in his ab&s;ence, and particularly that none be &s;uffered to approach your chamber, but in my pre&s;ence and by my appointment. The command of the ca&s;tle is to be committed to my brother: and &s;trict ward to be maintained. But he is no friend to oppre&s;&s;ion. I have already &s;ounded, and find him apt to our purpo&s;e.</Q> Ela pa&s;&s;ionately entreated that this man &s;hould be brought before her: but &s;oon recollecting the nece&s;&s;ity of avoiding all &s;u&s;picion, &s;he contented her&s;elf with intru&s;ting to Eli|nor the important charge of prevailing on him. Into her hands &s;he earne&s;tly gave up all her &s;tore of
<PB N="75" REF="74">wealth: and the good attendant prudently and faith|fully employed &s;uch part of it as was nece&s;&s;ary to con|firm the wavering re&s;olution of her brother. She prevailed, and returned with the plea&s;ing tidings that he had con&s;ented to follow the fortunes of the Coun|te&s;s, and to &s;eize the approaching occa&s;ion to convey her and her young &s;on to any place of &s;afety. In the mean time &s;he advi&s;ed that Ela &s;hould &s;till continue the appearance of malady and weakne&s;s, and patiently wait the happy moment of her deliverance. The eyes of this lady brightened up with joy and plea&s;ure, and her brea&s;t laboured with the violent emotions of gratitude. 'Gracious powers!' (thus her pa&s;&s;ions forced their way) <Q>Is this the va&s;&s;al of an unju&s;t op|pre&s;&s;or? This the agent of tyranny and cruelty? Say, whence hath thy gentle manners been &s;o &s;trangely a&s;&s;ociated with &s;avage pride and u&s;urpa|tion? Whence hath thy goodne&s;s and affection been cho&s;en by Lord Raymond to mini&s;ter to his purpo&s;es? Who art thou, that feel'&s;t my affliction, and art thus kindly &s;ollicitous for my relief?</Q> The attendant wept, and thus returned an&s;wer to the en|quiries of the Counte&s;s.</P>

<P><Q>HAPPIER days have I beheld; and better fortune have I experienced. I had a hu&s;|band, lady, brave and hone&s;t: a &s;on too, trained to arms, and exerci&s;ed in deeds of war.&mdash;But heaven was plea&s;ed to take them from me.</Q>&mdash; Here her grief broke forth with &s;till greater violence, and redoubled the attention of the Counte&s;s; nor did &s;he &s;oon recover &s;uch ea&s;e as enabled her to proceed in the following manner.</P>
<P><Q>Our re&s;idence was in the neighbourhood of Not|tingham, where we lived in peace, removed from the cares of greatne&s;s, and the bitterne&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s. My hu&s;band was loving; Edmund our only child, the delight of our eyes, and comfort of our advanc|cing
<PB N="76" REF="75">years. Tho' bred to arms, he was mild and gentle, and tho' nurtured in the humble vale of life, he was brave and generous. Even from his infant years, he had conceived an affection for the daughter (&s;he too the only child) of a neighbouring Franklin, which grew with their ripening age; nor was condemned or controuled. The fond parents beheld this youthful pair of lovers with &s;ecret joy; and hoped, in them, to tran&s;mit their names and little inheritances to &s;ucceeding times. They were betrothed, and but waited for the holy benediction to crown their wi&s;hes; when war and tumult began to rage in England. John was then our king: he had &s;ubmitted, and was reconciled to the holy father. He had attempted to recover his domini|ons in France; but, abandoned by his di&s;contented Nobles, he returned to his kingdom, full of vexa|tion and revenge. Ah, Lady! little doth the high|born Courtier or the powerful Lord conceive of that weight of mi&s;ery which public di&s;&s;entions heap upon the lowly &s;ubject! The King marched like an enemy thro' the land, &s;poiling and ravaging the e&s;tates of his wayward Barons. He arrived at Not|tingham where my Lord of Canterbury, at length, prevailed to &s;top his unfriendly progre&s;s. He con|tinued here for &s;ome time: his followers, &s;ecure in his protection, and enriched by his bounty, little regarded the &s;evere limits which laws pre&s;cribe. Gay revellers they; who, full of mirth and di&s;port, beguiled the time in &s;ong and dance with courtly dames. One of the&s;e glittering minions of royal favour perchance ca&s;t his wanton eyes on Edyth, the maid betrothed to my &s;on. Accur&s;ed be the hour, in which he di&s;covered and was enamoured with her beauty! He courted her in gentle gui&s;e, with fair &s;emblance of re&s;pect and decent love: he dazzled her with a view of co&s;tly gifts: he pro|mi&s;ed much, he &s;ighed often, and &s;ometimes wept; but all fruitle&s;s were his endeavours to conquer the integrity of this hone&s;t maiden. Yet, not entirely di&s;plea&s;ed at his flattering arts, &s;he li&s;tened without
<PB N="77" REF="76">terror or abhorrence, whil&s;t yet his purpo&s;e was not directly avowed; and &s;ometimes, yielding to his courte&s;y, &s;uffered him to lead her forth, and to amu&s;e her ear with tales of courtly plea&s;ures and &s;plendor. The jealous anxiety of Edmund ever watched their &s;teps at wary di&s;tance: 'till at length, when this incautious maid had been conducted to a &s;ecret path, when &s;he &s;uddenly found her helple&s;s innocence at the mercy of a luxurious courtier; when he boldly pre&s;t his &s;uit, and attempted to force her, trembling and di&s;mayed, to his wicked purpo&s;e, her piercing &s;hrieks &s;oon &s;ummoned a faithful deli|verer to her &s;ide. Edmund, mad with rage and jealou&s;y, fatally &s;mote the ravi&s;her; and carele&s;sly leaving him weltering in blood, conveyed away his Edyth, who had fainted with terror and &s;urprize, and &s;afely depo&s;ited his heart's dear trea&s;ure in her father's dwelling.</Q></P>
<P><Q>An event like this was not to be concealed: nor did the unhappy youth, now mad with pa&s;&s;ion, and deaf to the calls of prudence, fear to avow his bloody deed freely and publicly. Soon was the bo|dy di&s;covered; and &s;oon was Edmund &s;eized, and torn from his frantic mi&s;tre&s;s. An armed band hur|ried him away, with loud and tumultuous denun|ciations of vengeance; when happily the King, now returning from the chace, de&s;cried the rout, and di&s;patched an attendant to demand the cau&s;e of &s;uch di&s;order. Of this he was in&s;tantly informed; and curious to learn the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a pre&s;ump|tuous violence upon his officer, to view the man who even boa&s;ted of his outrage, he ordered the criminal to be brought before him. My &s;on was now led forward; and as he prepared to ca&s;t him&s;elf at the feet of his Liege, the fiery bea&s;t which the King be&s;trode, frighted at the tumult, began to &s;tart and rear up with ungovernable wildne&s;s. The attendants in&s;tantly alighted; but before they could &s;upport their falling ma&s;ter, Edmund had bur&s;t like lightning from the hands of his guards, broke his fall and remounted him. This zeal and vigour
<PB N="78" REF="77">were beheld with wonder, and &s;ecret applau&s;e. The King him&s;elf was by no means unaffected by the incident. His looks grew le&s;s &s;evere; and in a tone, not angry, but maje&s;tically grave, he de|manded to know who he was, and what had prompt|ed him to this act of blood. My &s;on kneeled be|fore him, mode&s;t but not abject; and with an inge|nuous plainne&s;s and freedom, related the unhappy cau&s;e that had provoked him to this outrage: his love to the betrothed maid; the arts and treachery to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed; the horrid attempt of violation; and his own fatal encounter with the King's-officer. In a word, he ackowledged the crime, and with decent boldne&s;s declared him&s;elf re&s;igned to the puni&s;hment, and prepared to yield up his forfeit life. The King li&s;tened with atten|tion, and in the natural and unaffected narrative &s;aw the full proof of all that had been alledged. With a &s;udden warmth, he &s;wore by the foot of God, (his u&s;ual oath) that his &s;ervant had de&s;erv|edly met his &s;ate; that Edmund was a brave youth, and merited not only pardon, but reward; and that henceforward he &s;hould be his &s;oldier. The wit|ne&s;&s;e&s;s of this &s;cene were not &s;low to applaud the &s;entiments of their &s;overeign. They vied with each other in their prai&s;es of my &s;on, who&s;e youth|ful brea&s;t was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of their impre&s;&s;i|ons How happy did we then e&s;teem our&s;elves, when we &s;aw our child re&s;cued from de&s;truction, graced with the royal favour, and entru&s;ted with an honourable command! To us he paid his filial duty; then flew to the beloved Edyth, to comfort her for|row and revive her &s;pirit, confounded and depre&s;|&s;ed by the late event. Of her, he took a tender leave, with a&s;&s;urances of invariable fidelity, and pa&s;&s;ionate vows of &s;peedy return to compleat his happine&s;s; then departed to perform the duties of his new charge. But we were not as yet totally bereft of our darling object; &s;ome intervals he found for brief, yet frequent vi&s;itings; to delight us with the ac|counts of his advancing fortune. So compleatly was
<PB N="79" REF="78">he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the thoughts of war and ho|nour; &s;o elevated and tran&s;ported by the view of courtly &s;plendor, and the gay promi&s;es of youthful ambition, that love &s;eemed to hold but a &s;econd place within his mind: and the &s;ighs and half-&s;up|pre&s;&s;ed tears of Edyth, &s;ometimes con&s;e&s;&s;ed her jealous fear of his e&s;trangement. He &s;aw, and chid her unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions: to allay them, he pro|po&s;ed that the holy Father &s;hould in&s;tantly unite their hands. Their nuptials were &s;udden; and their conjugal endearments, alas! too &s;oon inter|rupted by our &s;on's nece&s;&s;ary attendance on his roy|al ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The land was now threatened with all the ca|lamities of civil war. A &s;econd time had the bold Barons put on their armour, and collected their va&s;&s;als again&s;t John. My hu&s;band, altho' he bad already &s;uffered in their cau&s;e, yet &s;till adhered with an ob&s;tinate integrity, to that &s;ide which he deemed the great bulwark of his country. He ear|ne&s;tly pre&s;t young Edmund to abandon the &s;ervice of a prince who&s;e &s;avour was precarious; &s;uddenly and capriciou&s;ly be&s;towed; and as &s;uddenly and capriciou&s;ly withdrawn. But he was heard with reluctance and aver&s;ion. He urged the &s;olid com|forts of hone&s;t poverty and contentment; he called it &s;hameful (forgive me, Lady, if his homely &s;enti|ments offend) to unite with repacious foreigners, and to embrue his hands in the blood of country|men and brethren. His &s;on was &s;till unmoved, and to all his arguments oppo&s;ed one plea, his forfeit life, and the va&s;t debt of gratitude he owed the King. A father's authority was then exerted. He was commanded, upon his filial obedience, to attend on the confederated Lords; the terrors of divine vengeance were denounced on his unduti|ful ob&s;tinacy. He he&s;itated; but the flattering pro&s;pects of ambition at length prevailed. He for|got the &s;ubm&s;&s;ion due to a parent's authority; full of gay hopes and impatient of controul, he ha&s;t|ened away to &s;erve his liege lord, whil&s;t my hu&s;band,
<PB N="80" REF="79">irritated at his di&s;obedience, pronounced &s;omething like a cur&s;e upon his unhappy &s;on, and followed the &s;tandard of William de Albinet the commanding Baron.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thro' the cour&s;e of the&s;e unhappy conte&s;ts, Ed|mund encrea&s;ed in honour; and &s;till more and more approved his active valour. It is too well known with what &s;hameful di&s;regard to the protection of their adherents, the Barons &s;uffered a number of the mo&s;t faithful to their cau&s;e to be &s;hut up within the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, and to be &s;orely pre&s;t by the royal army, while they them&s;elves rioted in London. In a fatal hour, Edmund was commanded to the &s;iege of this ca&s;|tle. &mdash;O Lady! a few words are &s;ufficieut for the re&s;t of his &s;ad &s;tory. How doth the dreadful re|membrance pierce my afflicted heart! Many deeds of manhood did he atchieve; and oftentimes did he repel the de&s;perate valour of the be&s;ieged. At the head of a &s;mall party, he at length ven|tured too ra&s;hly to approach the ca&s;tle walls; and was &s;uddenly encountered by a larger body of the enemy. The conte&s;t was ob&s;tinate and bloody: but his a&s;&s;ociates were borne down by numbers, and le&s;t him, as they yielded, &s;ingly engaged with a &s;oldier, who&s;e &s;word threatened de&s;truc|tion. They ru&s;hed upon each other, they clo&s;ed, they redoubled their deadly blows, 'till at length, a well directed &s;troke from the arm of Edmund fell upon the front of his antagoni&s;t, cle&s;t his bearer, and uncovered his wounded head. Ed|mund &s;tarted! &s;tood agha&s;t! uttered &s;ome con|fu&s;ed &s;ounds of horror! how can I &s;peak it! &mdash; The ill fated youth&mdash;O for ever accur&s;ed be the authors of every civil &s;trife!&mdash;had &s;mote his fa|ther.</Q> &mdash; Here the di&s;order of the unhappy mother &s;topped her voice. The Counte&s;s was &s;carcely le&s;s affected: &s;he trembled, as if witne&s;s of the horrid &s;cene: and Elinor at length proceeded thus.</P>
<P><Q>My hu&s;band, &s;tunned and &s;aint, was &s;inking down; when Edmund &s;eized him in his arms,
<PB N="81" REF="80">and gently laid him upon the earth. He kneeled before him, in all the bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h and di&s;|traction. His lamentations were loud and wild; and earne&s;tly did he implore for pardon; and bit|terly did he cur&s;e his own fatal error. The lan|guid eyes of his father were fixed kindly upon him; his faltering voice &s;poke forgivene&s;s. And now was Edmund preparing to bind up his wound, and to convey him to &s;ome place of &s;afety and relief, when the noi&s;e of tumult and rout grew loud. He turned his head ha&s;tily, to learn the cau&s;e; and, in that fatal moment, received a &s;hot from a cro&s;s-bow full in his brain. The &s;on &s;unk down by the &s;ide of the bleeding father; the routed, and the pur&s;uers (a party of the royal army who had come to the &s;upport of their a&s;&s;ociates) trampled upon their bodies. Edmund had at once expired with a groan. My hu&s;band lived but to relate the dreadful &s;tory.</Q></P>
<P>Here the attendant &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s her &s;orrow. Not &s;o the gentle Counte&s;s. Her tender mind was deeply pierced; and freely was her pity uttered.&mdash;'Thus,' &s;aid Elinor, <Q>in one accur&s;ed hour, was I bereft of all my comfort. The ca|lamity was too great for my weak heart to bear. The relation in&s;tantly confu&s;ed my brain, and deprived me of rea&s;on. Long did I continue in a melancholy in&s;en&s;ibility to my di&s;tre&s;s; and per|haps, heaven was kind in thus afflicting me. When time, and a brother's tender care, had at length re&s;tored my di&s;ordered &s;en&s;es, I learned, that the wretched Edyth had been &s;eized with the pangs of untimely childbirth, had with pain and &s;orrow given her lifele&s;s burden to the light, long lan|gui&s;hed in &s;ickne&s;s and grief; and was at length re|tired to a religious hou&s;e, there to end her wretched days. And there were they &s;oon ended. I my &s;elf had been de&s;poiled of all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by the &s;ury of civil war, in which both parties were equally incen&s;ed again&s;t my hu&s;band or my &s;on. Re&s;cued from death, and &s;upported by the kind|ne&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="81">of my brother, the va&s;&s;al of Lord Raymond; him have I followed, and by his means have I been placed here; ready to obey our Lord in all humble and hone&s;t duties: but we have not yet learned to be the ba&s;e in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion.</Q>&mdash; Here &s;he pau&s;ed and wept. The Counte&s;s laboured to comfort, and to in&s;pire her with hopes of better fortune; repeated her a&s;&s;urances of favour and pro|tection; and earne&s;tly declared, that to be happy, &s;he had but to extricate a grateful mi&s;tre&s;s from her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>THE long wi&s;hed for day at length appeared, when Raymond and his Knights were to i&s;&s;ue forth, and O&s;wald the brother of Elinor was to be warder of the ca&s;tle. The time and manner of e&s;cape had been duely concerted. The garb of an humble dome&s;tic had been provided for the Counte&s;s: in which di&s;gui&s;e, &s;he, together with her &s;on and faithful woman, were to be conveyed thro' a po&s;tern gate, which led to a neighbouring wood: there was O&s;wald to provide hor&s;es, and from thence to conduct them to a religious hou&s;e, which had been enriched by the pious bounty of Ela, in her more pro&s;perous days: and where &s;he now hoped to find due regard, and inviolable &s;anctuary. The day was &s;pent in pre|paration; in fears and hopes, and anxiety. At length the mid-hour of night approached, the hour ap|pointed for departure. O&s;wald by means of a tru&s;ty &s;ervant had placed his hor&s;es in the wood: and had &s;o &s;tationed his men as to prevent them from being witne&s;&s;es of his de&s;ign. The Counte&s;s had put on her di&s;gui&s;e, embraced her &s;on, and delivered him to the hand of Elinor. Their conductor led them cautiou&s;|ly and &s;ilently thro' the ca&s;tle. They had pa&s;&s;ed the gate, and were now &s;tretching towards the wood with more enlivened &s;teps, when the &s;hrill &s;ound of a horn proceeded from the other &s;ide of the
<PB N="83" REF="82">ca&s;tle, and proclaimed the approach of &s;ome knight or &s;tranger. O&s;wald &s;tarted, the women trembled; the &s;ound was loudly repeated; and returned from the adjacent hills: when O&s;wald, marking where the full moon di&s;clo&s;ed a beaten path, and pointing towards the wood, earne&s;tly pre&s;t them to bend their cour&s;e thither without fear or he&s;itation, and there to wait his coming; which he promi&s;ed &s;hould be &s;peedy. He &s;poke of the pre&s;ent alarm as of no moment, but declared him&s;elf re&s;olved to learn the occa&s;ion of it. They obeyed; and he returned into the ca&s;tle: where he appeared opportunely to prevent &s;u&s;picion or detection. The dome&s;tics were all rou&s;|ed, and &s;ome had already mounted the battlements to demand, who, at this dead hour, had approached the ca&s;tle, and on what occa&s;ion. They were an&s;wered, that there &s;tood two per&s;ons at the gates di&s;patched by Hubert chief ju&s;ticiary, to Lord Ray|mond on e&s;pecial affairs; that they had been mi&s;|guided, and wandered thro' the country until night had overtaken them: that at length they had recover|ed the true path, and that their fatigue required im|mediate entrance and refre&s;hment. By the command of O&s;wald, they were admitted and entertained with due courte&s;y. He, tho' determined to abandon the &s;ervice of Raymond, and impatient to rejoin the Counte&s;s, and her &s;on, yet could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of conferring with the&s;e me&s;&s;engers; and e&s;pecially when he learned from one of them, who &s;eemed of in|ferior quality, that they brought &s;ome intelligence about lord Sali&s;bury. He invited this man to refre&s;h him&s;elf with wine (for the other had retired to re&s;t.) He entertained him with all ho&s;pitable kindne&s;s, and from him learned, that but a little time &s;ince, &s;olemn ju&s;ts and tournaments had been held at the Engli&s;h court, in which a young knight of France (induced as he declared, by the fame of the gallant nobles of Britain) had appeared, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his prowe&s;s and courage. That the King and his courtiers had received him with all due ho|nours: that in &s;ome conver&s;ations, he had lamented
<PB N="84" REF="83">the fate of an Engli&s;h Lord known in both realms by the name of Sali&s;bury: who as he was informed, had been pur&s;ued by adver&s;e fortune in Poictou, ob|liged to fly before his enemies, abandoned by his few attendants, and accompanied only by a fair and noble lady; and that too &s;trong rea&s;ons there were to fear that he had peri&s;hed. O&s;wald heard him with a violent yet well di&s;&s;embled emotion; and hav|ing prevailed on him to retire, pau&s;ed, tho' &s;till anxi|ous to &s;eek the Counte&s;s, and debated within his mind, whether he &s;hould communicate this intelli|gence or no. As he was not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the refined and exalted &s;entiments of noble minds, he concluded that the hopes of her Lord's return were Ela's only motive for receiving the addre&s;&s;es of Lord Raymond with &s;uch &s;everity and abhorrence, and that any a&s;&s;urances of his death, mu&s;t determine her to accept the tenders of his love: he therefore re&s;olved freely to declare what he had ju&s;t now heard; and ho|ped that &s;he might thus be prevailed on to abandon the de&s;ign of flying, and to return to her ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tics were now &s;eparated; and &s;ilence and tranquillity again re&s;tored: when O&s;wald again i&s;&s;ued forth, &s;till firmly re&s;olved to obey the com|mands of the Counte&s;s, whatever the&s;e might be, and faithfully to follow her fortunes, &s;hould &s;he be &s;till re&s;olute to tempt the dangers of flight. He found her at the appointed &s;tation impatient of his tedious ab&s;ence, and almo&s;t &s;inking under the terrors of night and &s;olitude. Elinor &s;at by her &s;ide, &s;till more di&s;mayed, &s;upporting her young &s;on, and &s;hielding him from the dampy air whil&s;t he lay compo&s;ed in peaceful &s;leep. The moon was ha&s;tening to her decline; and threatened to involve them in all the horrors of darkne&s;s; when their long expected protec|tor at length appeared to relieve their di&s;tracting fears. He briefly related the occa&s;ion of his delay; the ar|rival of the&s;e me&s;&s;engers, and the di&s;cour&s;e which he had held with one of them. The bare mention of intelligence about Lord William, rai&s;ed an uni|ver&s;al agitation in the Counte&s;s. The melancholy
<PB N="85" REF="84">air which O&s;wald a&s;&s;umed, encrea&s;ed her terror and impatience: nor had he yet fini&s;hed his relation, when the blood de&s;erted the cheeks of Ela. She clo&s;ed her eyes, and died away. Elinor &s;hrieked, O&s;wald &s;upported her; but their cares were a long time ineffectual. At length, the Counte&s;s rai&s;ed her languid front, and breathed a heart-felt &s;igh. 'He was then di&s;loyal!' &s;aid &s;he:&mdash;<Q>A noble la|dy! &mdash;was &s;he noble?&mdash;But alas, I fear, hea|ven hath &s;everely puni&s;hed his guilt?</Q> O&s;wald now perceived his own imprudence, and would have offer|ed comfort: but the Counte&s;s was wholly engaged by her own &s;ad thoughts. He repeatedly pre&s;t and enforced the danger of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedy departure: but no attention could he gain. At length, turning her &s;adly &s;treaming eyes &s;lowly upon him; 'No, my friend!' &s;aid &s;he, <Q>the&s;e languid limbs mu&s;t here find their grave.&mdash;Yet &mdash;it were a ble&s;&s;ing to end my days in the man&s;i|ons of devotion, to hear the reverend father &s;peak comfort to my departing &s;pirit:&mdash;but, I cannot &mdash;this frame is too feeble: the hand of death pre&s;&s;es too &s;everely upon me.&mdash;O friends! if ever your hearts knew pity, look upon that boy. He was not born to this wretchedne&s;s: he hath &s;till noble friends.&mdash;If you would atone to heaven for your offences, &s;ave him; convey him quickly from the power of his enemies. Seek the place appointed for our retreat; there &s;ave your&s;elves and him: there &s;hall the friends of his hou&s;e find him re&s;cued from cruelty and u&s;urpation: they &s;hall protect and defend him; they &s;hall a&s;&s;ert his rights and reward your fidelity. The&s;e jewels, the&s;e trea&s;ures &s;hall reward you. My &s;on &s;hall live to reward you.</Q>&mdash;Elinor, kneeling before her with weeping eyes and lifted hands, earne&s;tly en|treated her to collect her &s;pirits and to pur&s;ue her intended flight: uttering the mo&s;t ardent and pa&s;|&s;ionate vows that fear or force &s;hould never drive her from her beloved mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;'If I am beloved,' &s;aid the Counte&s;s, <Q>&s;hew me thy love; and &s;ave
<PB N="86" REF="85">my child. Think not of me. I can die here: and &s;ome charitable hand may perhaps be &s;ound to clo&s;e my eyes in peace.</Q> Here &s;he again fainted: nor could all the tender care and &s;ollicitude exerted to re|lieve her, re&s;tore her to life and &s;en&s;e. Elinor hung weeping over her: O&s;wald was di&s;mayed and di&s;|tracted: he &s;aw the danger of this ra&s;h enterprize, and could think of no re&s;ource: he would have con&s;ulted with his &s;i&s;ter; but her mind was engaged only by her mi&s;tre&s;s. He &s;uddenly called to his at|tendant, who &s;till continued at &s;ome di&s;tance with the hor&s;es: one of the&s;e he mounted: the Counte&s;s was rai&s;ed up and placed reclining in his arms. Thus he proceeded gently towards a cottage which lay at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance; who&s;e charitable inhabitants ro&s;e at the noi&s;e of benighted travellers, and ad|mitted them. The Counte&s;s was di&s;po&s;ed upon their humble couch, and now once again recovered from her trance. She thanked the tenderne&s;s of the afflicted Elinor: then calling to O&s;wald, with hands and eyes rai&s;ed to heaven, &s;he earne&s;tly conjured him by all his hopes of future happine&s;s, to fly with her &s;on to &s;anctuary, to proclaim his and her wrongs: and particularly to &s;eek the protection of the Lord de Warren his father's noble friend; who would receive and &s;hield his helple&s;s innocence, a&s;&s;ert his rights, and controul his oppre&s;&s;ors. Of her&s;elf &s;he &s;pake with indifference; as a per&s;on on the point of finding refuge from her enemies in the arms of death. O&s;wald was &s;o per&s;uaded: he regarded her pre&s;ent languid &s;tate as the la&s;t &s;ad period of her life; and looking tenderly upon his &s;i&s;ter, &s;eemed to wi&s;h that &s;he could fly from the re&s;entment of Lord Raymond. But &s;oon were his thoughts checked by the zealous declarations of this friendly matron, that no fear of power, no threats of puni&s;hment, no motive whate|ver &s;hould prevail upon her to abandon her dear mi&s;tre&s;s: &s;he urged him to obey her commands with &s;peed, and to leave them to the protection of hea|ven.
<PB N="87" REF="86">The hone&s;t heart of O&s;wald was affected: in a pa&s;&s;ionate fit of zeal, he declared him&s;elf ready to fly with young William. The anxious mother thanked him with her looks: &s;he cla&s;ped her &s;on with a feeble but tender embrace; and lifting her eyes devoutly towards heaven, commended him to the protection of all the holy angels. His looks con|fe&s;&s;ed his infant fear, when &s;he delivered him to his conductor. He wept, and was cenveyed away. Some few tears dropt from the Counte&s;s; but the recollection of his e&s;cape, and the hopes of his pre|&s;ervation, &s;oon gave comfort to her afflicted mind, and animated her with new life and &s;pirit. Her eyes were lighted up anew; her voice le&s;s faltering, and her frame le&s;s languid. She now &s;eemed to defy her oppre&s;&s;ors, and declared her&s;elf re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume her rightful authority and &s;tate; to act as mi&s;tre&s;s of her ca&s;tle and domain, in open defiance of the bold intruders. By the dawn of morning, &s;ome pea&s;ants were di&s;patched to the ca&s;tle to give notice of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and to order &s;uch conveniencies as were nece&s;&s;ary for her removal. A litter together with the proper attendants was &s;oon &s;ent for this purpo&s;e. Elinor, &s;till faithful to her charge, waited on the &s;ide of her beloved lady: who now again entered her own &s;tately hall, and was laid with care and tender offices of duty upon her own couch.</P>

<P>IN the mean time, confu&s;ion had &s;pread among the dome&s;tics. Morning di&s;covered the de&s;erti|on of O&s;wald; and &s;carcely had me&s;&s;engers been di&s;patched to inform Lord Raymond of this event, and the arrival of the two &s;trangers, when they learned the &s;ituation of the Counte&s;s, and were direct|ed to conduct her back to her apartnient. A &s;econd
<PB N="88" REF="87">me&s;&s;age was in&s;tantly di&s;patched to their Lord, with this alarming intelligence: and, ere long, he ap|peared in view, goating the &s;ides of his cour&s;er, whil&s;t a few attendants &s;tretched after him at &s;ome di&s;tance, in vain &s;triving to keep pace with his impa|tience. He entered the ca&s;tle with looks wild and di&s;ordered; and flew towards the apartment of the Counte&s;s; but was &s;topped by &s;ome of her maidens, who were directed to inform him that her pre&s;ent weakne&s;s and malady required re&s;t, and could not permit him to approach. He called for Elinor, who appeared before him trembling. He &s;ternly re|proached her with pre&s;umptuous treachery and di&s;|obedience; and demanded to know where her brother lay concealed, whither and for what purpo&s;e he had fled. Elinor &s;till trembled and was &s;ilent: Raymond thundered out terrible denunciations of vengeance; when the Counte&s;s who heard his rage from the ad|jacent chamber, &s;uddenly &s;ent to de&s;ire his pre&s;ence. He ru&s;hed in with glaring looks of fury and di&s;tracti|on; when, ri&s;ing her head gently from her pillow, Ela thus acco&s;ted him. <Q>Proud Lord, thy power is at an end. I am above thy oppre&s;&s;ion; I am ha&s;tening to the man&s;ions of peace. My &s;on is &s;afe. Yes! that hone&s;t man has conveyed him to the neighbouring mona&s;tery, who&s;e hallowed &s;anc|tuary &s;hall protect him from thee and thy minions. Thither thou can&s;t not force thy way. Thence, &s;hall our wrongs be boldly and loudly echoed thro' the land, and &s;oon &s;hall the noble friends of Sali&s;bu|ry appear, to end thy u&s;urpation, to cha&s;ti&s;e thy mini&s;ters of cruelty, and to revenge the injuries done even to the meane&s;t of Ela's attendants.</Q>&mdash; Thus &s;peaking, &s;he turned away with marks of &s;corn; again reclined her head, nor deigned the lea&s;t regard to his extravagant expre&s;&s;ions of vexation and furptize. He bur&s;t away in mad di&s;order and confu&s;ion: he ranged wildly through the galleries; &s;tarted, and endeavoured to collect his thoughts and allay his pa&s;&s;ions; cur&s;t his own ra&s;h folly which
<PB N="89" REF="88">had tempted him abroad, afforded this opportunity of detecting and defeating his de&s;igns and threatened to cover him with &s;hame and &s;corn. Then again he ru&s;hed forward in an agony of rage and vexation, when one of the me&s;&s;engers from Hubert approached with re&s;pectful obei&s;ance; and obliged him to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome appearance of ea&s;e and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>From him Lord Raymond learned the &s;everal par|ticulars, which his companion had before imparted to O&s;wald. But as this man was admitted more in|timately into the confidence of Hubert, he was farther directed to declare, that the friends to the hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury began to expre&s;s their fears, that the long-protracted re&s;idence of Raymond in this ca&s;tle, without any intelligence being received of the di&s;po&s;itions of the Counte&s;s, any a&s;&s;urances of her con&s;ent to accept his hand, had rai&s;ed jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions in their minds; and that Hubert therefore urged him to renew his efforts, if he &s;till continued un&s;ucce&s;sful; to improve tho&s;e rumours about Earl William, into full and certain a&s;&s;urances of his death, and with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed and earne&s;tne&s;s to ha&s;ten on his own nuptials with the Counte&s;s. He thanked the &s;tranger, and commended his fidelity; he re|que&s;ted him to retire for a while, promi&s;ing to con|fer more fully with him at better lei&s;ure: then re&s;igned him&s;elf to the di&s;order of his mind, which this information and advice &s;erved to inflame and irritate. He now &s;aw the mi&s;guided cour&s;e which he had pur&s;ued. He formed the mo&s;t dreadful pre&s;ages of that di&s;honour which mu&s;t attend his violence and unlawful oppre&s;&s;i&oacute;n. His pa&s;&s;ion for the Counte&s;s was &s;till alive; and for a while he &s;eemed re&s;olved once more to try the gentle arts of love and tenderne&s;s; but the recollection of her rigour and di&s;dain, her wrongs and &s;ufferings, in a moment da&s;hed all his hopes, and he re&s;olved to fall at her feet, to implore her pardon, and to retire from her ca&s;tle. For this purpo&s;e he again approached her apartment, and demanded admittance. Elinor ap|peared
<PB N="90" REF="89">before him, kneeled, and with many tears implored his indulgence for the weak &s;tate of her un|happy Lady. 'Heaven only knows,' &s;aid the kind attendant, <Q>whether &s;he hath yet a few days of life remaining. Let not thy noble nature afflict the already too &s;everely afflicted. Let her die in peace; or if &s;he may yet live, break not on that tranquillity which may be the happy means of re&s;toring her.' Wretch!</Q> cried Raymond, wildly &s;urveying her, as &s;he humbled her&s;elf before him, <Q>thou ha&s;t undone me! Accur&s;ed be the &s;lave who hath a&s;&s;i&s;ted thee to betray me! But why do I think of thee, thou reptile? Come, lead me to this Lady; let me di&s;pel her maladies, let me give her peace, and leave her.</Q>&mdash;Elinor &s;tarted up, confounded and a&s;toni&s;hed at this my&s;terious language, earne&s;t for an explana|tion, yet too much awed and terrified to &s;peak her wi&s;hes. Raymond &s;ternly repeated his orders; and in that moment, the inhuman Grey, with all marks of ha&s;te and impatience, ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly into the apartment.</P>
<P>He had heard of the e&s;cape and return of the Counte&s;s, and of the flight of O&s;wald. He had &s;purred on with wild &s;peed to learn more particularly the rea&s;on and purpo&s;e of the&s;e alarming events! his own con&s;cious guilt had rai&s;ed dreadful pre&s;ages in his mind: nor were the&s;e allayed by the di&s;order in which he now found Lord Raymond. To him he addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome ha&s;ty and imper&s;ect que&s;tions. Raymond gazed on him for a while with an a&s;pect which plainly di&s;covered an inward &s;trife, and doubt whether to accu&s;e this man as his evil coun&s;ellor, or to entreat his a&s;&s;i&s;tance as a faithful friend. At length, as if bowed down by violence of pa&s;&s;ion, he reclined on his arm, and was led away into another apartment. There he di&s;tinctly recounted the advices he had received from Hubert; and the jealou&s;ies expre&s;&s;ed by the friends of the hou&s;e of Sali&s;bury, which mu&s;t now be enflamed and confirmed by the fal&s;e O&s;wald, who had fled to &s;anctuary with young William.
<PB N="91" REF="90">He &s;poke with pity and tenderne&s;s of the Counte&s;s whom his own cruelty had driven from her ca&s;tle, and who&s;e flight had been prevented only by her malady and weakne&s;s. He expre&s;&s;ed his fears of de|tection and di&s;honour; that his unwarrantable u&s;ur|pation, and attempt upon the con&s;tancy of Ela, mu&s;t now cover him with &s;hame: he therefore declared him&s;elf re&s;olved to implore her forgivene&s;s, and to retire. The coward heart of Grey felt all the terrors that Raymond had expre&s;&s;ed, with double force. He was in&s;tantly filled with the imagination of that power and protection, which were &s;oon to &s;upport the injured Counte&s;s: he trembled at the re|collection of his own &s;hare of guilt and oppre&s;&s;ion: he commended the purpo&s;e of Lord Raymond, and urged him to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions without delay. But amid&s;t all his fears, cunning had not yet for&s;aken him. He &s;ecretly determined to make this re&s;olution of his Lord &s;eem the effect of his own advice, in order to plead &s;ome merit with the Counte&s;s, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to atone for his former in&s;olence. He there|fore propo&s;ed to Raymond, to make him the me&s;&s;en|ger of his de&s;ign, to entru&s;t him with the charge of acquainting Ela with his penitence, and his re&s;igna|tion of all hopes or preten&s;ions to her love or fortune. 'An interview,' &s;aid he, <Q>can only &s;erve to enflame your fond pa&s;&s;ion, and to make a &s;eparation doubly painful. No! tru&s;t not your eyes with the too powerful and affecting object.</Q> Raymond con&s;ent|ed; and Grey now prepared to &s;ummon Elinor, and to de&s;ire admi&s;&s;ion to the Counte&s;s; when acci|dentally, he a&s;ked Lord Raymond, who &s;till dwelt upon the late events, to what place of &s;anctuary O&s;|wald had retired. The neighbouring mona&s;tery of Sarum was no &s;ooner mentioned, than, &s;uddenly &s;tarting, as if a ray of comfort had ju&s;t &s;hot thro' his &s;oul, his eyes kindled, his cheeks glowed, his whole a&s;pect &s;poke &s;urprize and triumph: he eagerly &s;eized the hand of his a&s;toni&s;hed Lord; he pau&s;ed; their eyes encountered each other. 'Hope?' &s;aid
<PB N="92" REF="91">Grey: <Q>yet hope!&mdash;I mu&s;t depart this in&s;tant.&mdash; But, by all your fond wi&s;hes, by all your flattering pro&s;pects of love and greatne&s;s, I conjure you to &s;u&s;pend your purpo&s;e: &s;ee not, &s;peak not to this proud Counte&s;s, till my return.</Q> Raymond de|manded an explanation, but Grey only repeated his injunctions; urged him to retire, and left him filled with a&s;toni&s;hment and expectation.</P>
