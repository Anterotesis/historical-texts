<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE Nature and U&s;e of Spectacles.</HEAD>
<P>MY De&s;ign in the following Tract is to explain the Structure of the Eye, and the Nature of Vi&s;ion, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the U&s;e and Ad|vantage of Spectacles. The Method of chu&s;ing the be&s;t Sort of Gla&s;&s;es, and &s;uch as are &s;uitable to the different Defects of the Eye in different Per&s;ons; and to recommend a Kind of Gla&s;s, for this Purpo&s;e, much pre|ferable to any that has been hitherto made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>The Nature of Vi&s;ion, and U&s;e of Spec|tacles, will be be&s;t explain'd, by the com|mon Experiment of the dark Room, or as it is u&s;ually called the <HI>Camera Ob&s;cura,</HI> which is this. In any Room that is pretty much darken'd, let an Hole be made in the Win|dow-Shutter,
<PB N="4" REF="3">in which Hole place a convex Lens, or round globular Gla&s;s; then hold|ing a Sheet of white Paper within the Room, at a proper Di&s;tance from the Hole, (which you will find by Tryals) you will &s;ee on the Paper the Pictures of all Objects before the Hole, both in their ju&s;t Propor|tions, and in their proper Colours, only they will be up&s;ide down. If the Paper remain in the &s;ame Place, and in the Room of the afore&s;aid convex Gla&s;s, or Lens, one that is flatter be u&s;ed, the Picture upon the white Paper will then be confu&s;ed; but by placing a convex Spectacle-Gla&s;s before the Lens of a due Convexity, the Image on the Paper will again be render'd di&s;tinct. If a more con|vex Lens than the fir&s;t be u&s;ed, the Image on the Paper will again be confus'd, but may be render'd di&s;tinct, by placing in this ca&s;e a concave Spectacle-Gla&s;s before the Lens.</P>
<P>This Experiment exactly repre&s;ents the Manner of Vi&s;ion by the Eye; for the Eye is of a globular or convex Form, re&s;embling the Lens plac'd in the Hole in the Window-Shutter, the out&s;ide Coat of which is call'd the <HI>Cornea,</HI> and gives the convex Shape to the aqueous or watery Humour contain'd with|in it: On the Bottom of the Eye is expanded a fine Membrane call'd the <HI>Retina,</HI> which
<PB N="5" REF="4">re&s;embles the white Paper mention'd in the Experiment; on this Membrane the Pictures of all external Objects are form'd. When the Pictures are form'd di&s;tinct on the <HI>Reti|na,</HI> then the Object appears clear and di|&s;tinct; if the Pictures on the <HI>Retina</HI> are con|fu&s;ed, then the Object appears hazy and confu&s;ed. This Account of the Eye, and the Cau&s;e of Vi&s;ion, is farther confirm'd by the&s;e Arguments; that Anatomi&s;ts, when they have taken off from the Bottom of the Eye, that outward and thicke&s;t Coat call'd the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> can then &s;ee the Pictures of Objects lively painted on the <HI>Retina.</HI> And the&s;e Pictures propagated by Motion along the Fibres of the optick Nerves into the Brain, are the Cau&s;e of Vi&s;ion. For, ac|cording as the&s;e Pictures are perfect or im|perfect, the Object is &s;een perfectly or im|perfectly. If the Eye be ting'd with any Colour, (as in the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Jaundice) &s;o as to tinge the Pictures in the Bottom of the Eye with that Colour, then all Objects appear ting'd with the &s;ame Colour.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;ee the U&s;e of Spectacles; for the Humours of the Eye de|cay by old Age, &s;o as by &s;hrinking to make the <HI>Cornea</HI> grow flatter than before, in which Ca&s;e the Light will not be refracted
<PB N="6" REF="5">enough, and for want of a &s;ufficient Re|fraction will not converge to the Bottom of the Eye, but to &s;ome Place beyond it; and by Con&s;equence will paint in the Bottom of the Eye a confu&s;ed Picture, and according to the Indi&s;tinctne&s;s of this Picture the Ob|ject will appear confu&s;ed, ju&s;t as the Image on the Paper became confu&s;ed, when a Lens flatter than ju&s;t, was &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of the right one.</P>
<P>This is the rea&s;on of the Decay of Sight in old Men, and &s;hews why their Sight is mended by Spectacles. For the convex Gla&s;&s;es &s;upply the Defect of Plumpne&s;s in the Eye; and by increa&s;ing the Refractions make the Rays converge &s;ooner, &s;o as to convene di&s;tinctly at the Bottom of the Eye, if the Gla&s;s has a due Degree of Convexity, exactly in the &s;ame manner as the Defect of the too flat Lens was corrected, and the Picture render'd di&s;tinct, by placing a Spec|tacle-Gla&s;s of due Convexity before it.</P>
<P>And the contrary happens in &s;hort-&s;ighted Men, who&s;e Eyes are too plump; for the Refractions being now too great, the Rays converge and convene in the Eyes before they come at the Bottom; and therefore the Picture made in the Bottom, and the Vi|&s;ion cau&s;ed thereby, will not be di&s;tinct, un|le&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="6">the Plumpne&s;s of the Eye be taken off, and the Refraction dimini&s;h'd by a concave Gla&s;s of a due Concavity, ju&s;t as the Con|fu&s;ion of the Image occa&s;ion'd by the U&s;e of too convex a Lens was remedied, by placing a Spectacle-Gla&s;s of a due Concavity before it.</P>
<P>This in general is the Manner in which the Defects of the Eye are remedied by the u&s;e of Gla&s;&s;es. But the&s;e Defects are neither the &s;ame in different Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Age, nor in the &s;ame Per&s;ons at different Ages. The Defects of the Eye are partly natural, and partly ari&s;e from Habits of looking either at very remote, or very near Objects; in the former Ca&s;e we flatten the Eye a little, in the latter we draw it up into a more convex Form to &s;ee di&s;tinctly; and by Habit the Eye will acquire and retain that Form, and will have a fix'd Shape, either too flat, or too globular for Objects at a mode|rate Di&s;tance. We &s;ee this confirm'd by every Day's Experience, for Engravers, Watchmakers, Cha&s;ers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by frequently forcing their Eyes into too convex a Form, to &s;ee minute Objects very near; at la&s;t have their Eyes fix'd in this Form, and become &s;hort-&s;ighted, e&s;pecially if they are u&s;ed to the&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es very young, while the Coats
<PB N="8" REF="7">of the Eye are tender and pliable. On the contrary, Sailors and Hu&s;bandmen, by look|ing out for di&s;tant Objects, are rarely or ever &s;hort-&s;ighted, and want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of convex Gla&s;&s;es very &s;oon, becau&s;e the Habit of flattening the Eye to &s;ee remote Objects, at la&s;t fixes it in this Form.</P>
<P>From hence we may &s;ee that the Defects of all per&s;ons Eyes will likely alter, accord|ing as they accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;uch Ha|bits as may either increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the&s;e Defects. Be&s;ides this, Age it&s;elf alters the Form of the Eye, making the Eyes of mo&s;t Per&s;ons grow flatter, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who &s;ee well at a moderate Di&s;tance, when young Per&s;ons, naturally &s;hort-&s;ighted, &s;eldom find any con&s;iderable Alteration in the Eye; but when they do alter, I have ob&s;erved that they oftener grow more &s;hort-&s;ighted than otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Since therefore the Defects of the Eye, and the Gla&s;&s;es proper to remedy the&s;e De|fects vary &s;o much, both in different Per|&s;ons and different Ages, I &s;hall now lay down &s;ome Rules, by which every one may chu&s;e not only good Gla&s;&s;es in their Kind; but &s;uch too, as are be&s;t &s;uited to the Form and Shape of their own Eye. Every good Eye has one certain Di&s;tance (or nearly &s;o)
<PB N="9" REF="8">of &s;eeing a common Print to read with Ea&s;e: When the Eye begins to grow too flat, you will find your&s;elf obliged to hold your Book at a greater Di&s;tance; you may ob&s;erve al&s;o, that if you read, write, or work any long Time, a &s;ort of Dizine&s;s like a Cobweb will appear before your Eyes, or if you read by a Candle you find it nece&s;&s;ary to hold the Paper behind it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Signs of the want of Spectacles, and whenever this appears to be the Ca&s;e, no Per&s;on &s;hould be without them; for your Endeavours to &s;ee what you cannot without great Difficulty, &s;trains and weakens the Eye, and by this you receive more Injury in a Month or two, than perhaps you other|wi&s;e would do in as many Years, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch Gla&s;&s;es, as would &s;upply that Defect, and render the Vi&s;ion di&s;tinct and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The next Thing then to be con&s;idered is, what Degree of Convexity is &s;ufficient to &s;upply this Defect. In order to make a proper Choice, hold a &s;mall Print at the Di|&s;tance, at which you was u&s;ed to read di|&s;tinctly, when your Eyes were good, which with mo&s;t People is about nine or ten Inch|es, then chu&s;e a Pair of Spectacles of &s;uch a Degree of Convexity as render the Letters
<PB N="10" REF="9">as plain as they u&s;ed to appear before your Sight was defective; if you chu&s;e them too young, <HI>i. e.</HI> not convex enough, they will &s;carce remedy the Defect of the Eye; and you will not &s;ee di&s;tinctly, unle&s;s the Print is &s;o far off, that the Letters will appear too &s;mall to be read. If you chu&s;e them too old, that is too convex, you will then be obliged to flatten the Eye to compen&s;ate the over great Convexity, and thereby be in danger of increa&s;ing that Defect, which Age natu|rally brings on.</P>
<P>But in many curious Pieces of Workman|&s;hip, there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of view|ing the Object under a larger Angle, that the mo&s;t minute Parts may be ob&s;erv'd. In this ca&s;e, Gla&s;&s;es of a larger Convexity may be u&s;ed, and if the Work be brought nearer to the Eye, its Form will not be much al|tered, but the &s;horter time the&s;e Objects are view'd the better.</P>
<P>For &s;hort-&s;ighted Per&s;ons, the be&s;t way is to look through a concave Lens at &s;ome di|&s;tant Object, and the lea&s;t Concave of all the Gla&s;&s;es, through which you can &s;ee it di|&s;tinctly, is the be&s;t. I divide all my Gla&s;&s;es into 20 Degrees, mark'd 1, 2, 3, and &s;o on. When a Per&s;on has fitted him&s;elf, I &s;et down his Name, with the Number of the
<PB N="11" REF="10">Gla&s;s cho&s;en, which prevents any more Trouble of Tryal, or even going for it; but &s;uch Per&s;on may be &s;upplied by &s;ending a Servant or Letter, unle&s;s any material Al|teration of the Eye &s;hould happen.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on who&s;e Re&s;idence is in the Coun|try, and has no Opportunity of making that Tryal, may nearly as well be fitted by the following Method; <HI>viz.</HI> Let the Per&s;on take a common Print, and move it to the Eye, till he &s;ees di&s;tinctly, then mea&s;ure the ex|act Di&s;tance from the Eye to the Paper: By &s;ending an Account of that Di&s;tance to any Per&s;on in the Trade, they may be fitted to a &s;ufficient Degree of Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>I come now to point out the Defects of the Gla&s;&s;es them&s;elves, and the way of di&s;|covering the&s;e Defects. Now the&s;e are ei|ther a fal&s;e Figure, Veins in the Gla&s;s, or the Colour of it. And fir&s;t for the Figure. Take any common Print, lay it on a Table, then hold the Spectacles in your Hand at a good Di&s;tance from the Eye, and looking through them, remove them gradually from the Paper, till the Spectacles are at the focal Di&s;tance from it, which in a convex Gla&s;s is &s;omewhat nearer to the Print, than the Point at which it begins to appear con&s;u&s;ed. If the Spectacles are &s;al&s;e, the Object through
<PB N="12" REF="11">the Middle of the Gla&s;s will appear regular and di&s;tinct, but through the Edges di&s;torted and confu&s;ed. Thus if you view any cro&s;s Lines, which form &s;mall Squares through a fal&s;e ground Gla&s;s, the Squares in the Mid|dle will appear with &s;trait Sides, di&s;tinct, and all of a Size; but tho&s;e near the Edges, with crooked Sides, of a different Bigne&s;s, and confu&s;ed; &s;o that the whole Appear|ance will neither be like the Original, nor all Parts of it di&s;tinct at the &s;ame Di&s;tance. If you view it through a true Gla&s;s, it will be perfectly like the original Figure, only bigger, and di&s;tinct in every Part. And as you gradually remove the Gla&s;s beyond the Focus, all Parts of the Object will become indi&s;tinct together.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover the Veins in convex Gla&s;&s;es, place a Candle from you about five or &s;ix Yards, then looking through the Gla&s;s move it from your Eye, till you fill it full of Light, and you will then di&s;cover every Vein and Speck in it. The&s;e Veins always di&s;tort Objects, and in the Object Gla&s;&s;es of Tele&s;copes and Micro&s;copes are e&s;pecially mi&s;chievous, &s;ince all the&s;e Errors are much magnified by the Eye-Gla&s;s. Specks differ from Veins; for Specks are only &s;mall o|pake Spots, which do not di&s;tort the Ob|ject,
<PB N="13" REF="12">but only intercept an incon&s;iderable Part of the Light coming from it.</P>
<P>For the Colour of Gla&s;s, the white&s;t has been generally made u&s;e of for Spectacles, but I am inclin'd on many Accounts to pre|fer another Sort before it, or any other Ma|terial that has been made u&s;e of for this Pur|po&s;e: For the common white Gla&s;s gives an offen&s;ive gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Light, very painful and prejudicial to the Eyes; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome advi&s;e green or blue Gla&s;s, tho' it tinge every Object with its own Colour, ra|ther than this white Sort. That which I would recommend, is of a finer Compo&s;ition than any commonly u&s;ed; its Colour is the fine&s;t of any, and being a little ting'd with Blue, it takes off the glaring Light from the Paper, and renders every Object &s;o ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, that the tendere&s;t Eye, may thro' it view any thing intently, without Pain. But, be&s;ides this, there are many other Rea&s;ons for rejecting the common white Gla&s;s, for 'tis of a &s;ofter Body than any other, and will not receive &s;o true a Figure in the poli&s;hing, as a Gla&s;s of a harder Nature will, neither will the Poli&s;h it&s;elf be &s;o fine and beautiful, nor of &s;o long Continuance; for if it lies by any con&s;ide|rable Time, it will change to a reddi&s;h Co|lour,
<PB N="14" REF="13">which is owing to the Nature of the Materials it is compo&s;ed of; be&s;ides, this Sort of Gla&s;s is generally found to be very full both of Specks and Veins; in&s;omuch, that one can hardly &s;ee any Spectacles made of this Sort of Gla&s;s that are free from it. That which I would here recommend is of an harder Nature, &s;uch as will receive a true Figure, and will take a very fine and high Poli&s;h, is perfectly tran&s;parent, and the free&s;t of any from Veins and Specks. I have always found this much preferable to any other Sort, both in Tele&s;copes and Mi|cro&s;copes, where the lea&s;t Faults are di&s;|cernable, e&s;pecially in the Object-Gla&s;s, where every Error in the Image, they form, is greatly magnified by the Eye-Gla&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Brazil</HI> Pebbles, and Rock Cry&s;tal Stones are much cried up by &s;ome for Spectacles; they are indeed very hard, and therefore will take a true Figure and a good Poli&s;h; but, be&s;ides a glaring Whitene&s;s, all the&s;e Stones have a Grain much like the I&s;land Cry&s;tal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton's</HI> Optics, Book 3. Quere 25.</NOTE>; and not only a Grain, but like that too, a double <HI>Refraction,</HI> &s;o that all Ob|jects appear double: Thus in&s;tead of one Letter there will appear two, one over the other. What Confu&s;ion this mu&s;t occa&s;ion
<PB N="15" REF="14">in the Print of a Book may be ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd at; and tho' this is &s;ometimes not great, &s;o that the Letters are not much confu&s;ed, yet it will occa&s;ion an Hazine&s;s and Indi|&s;tinctne&s;s, very like that of &s;ome Copper-Plate Prints, which have been moved a little on the Plate while they were printing off. If any one has a Mind to be fully &s;a|tisfied of the Fitne&s;s of the&s;e Bodies for Spectacles, let him try to u&s;e them for the Object-Gla&s;s of a Tele&s;cope. Every one conver&s;ant in Opticks knows, the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s in Figure, the mo&s;t perfect Free|dom from Veins, and the cleare&s;t Sub|&s;tances are always requi&s;ite to make a good Object-Gla&s;s in a long Tele&s;cope. But, if the&s;e Sub&s;tances are &s;o far from being pre|ferable, that they are the wor&s;t of all others for that Purpo&s;e, &s;o that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to make any Tele&s;cope at all with them; they mu&s;t, of Cour&s;e, be the wor&s;t of all others for Spectacles too, tho' their Faults are not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd in &s;o &s;imple an In&s;trument.</P>
