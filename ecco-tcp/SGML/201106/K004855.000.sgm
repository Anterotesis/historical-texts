<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the mo&s;t efficacious MEANS OF TREATING ULCERATED LEGS.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has been at all conver&s;ant in the practice of Surgery, or has at|tended an Ho&s;pital, mu&s;t have frequently ob|&s;erved the difficulty of healing an ulcer in the leg, which even when the patient is young, and appears of a &s;trong con&s;titution, often for a con&s;iderable time baffles the mo&s;t attentive ef|forts of the healing art; but when the ulcer is of long &s;tanding, and the per&s;on a little ad|vanced in life, it too frequently not only eludes every endeavour to effect a perfect cure, but is with difficulty brought to that &s;tate, &s;o as to be but &s;lightly painful, and in a &s;mall degree inconvenient. It is likewi&s;e not un|frequent, if the con&s;titutional fault, which
<PB N="4" REF="3">di&s;po&s;es to aggravate and continue this di&s;|ea&s;e, is not properly removed, although the &s;ur|geon &s;hould be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as in appearance to heal the &s;ore, that on re&s;uming u&s;ual ex|erci&s;e, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, the part becomes daily more painful, the tender co|vering appears &s;lightly tumified, and &s;oon breaking, a &s;ore again appears, that from its &s;ituation is liable to be aggravated by the &s;lighte&s;t injury, to which patients of this cla&s;s, from their nece&s;&s;ary avocations, are generally &s;ubject: the greater number of the&s;e un|fortunate &s;ufferers being tho&s;e, who are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to procure their &s;upport by labour or &s;ervitude, but who, whatever inconvenience they experience from the ulcer, &s;eldom, till after u&s;ing for &s;ome time different cerates and ointments, and &s;ometimes even irritating dre&s;&s;ings, apply for &s;urgical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This a&s;&s;i&s;tance often falling &s;hort of the wi&s;h of the practitioner, and expectation of the patient, has induced me to &s;ugge&s;t the few
<PB N="5" REF="4">following hints, which have occurred from an opportunity of &s;eeing a large number of the&s;e unfortunate ca&s;es; &s;incerely hoping, if thereby only a mite is contributed to the public benefit, by exciting more particular attention to this &s;ubject, tho&s;e gentlemen who are truly eminent in their profe&s;&s;ion, may favour the public with &s;ome more cer|tain and expeditious mode of removing this di&s;ea&s;e; the treatment of which now remains in &s;o imperfect a &s;tate, and gives &s;o dark a &s;hade to the general lines of Surgery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bell's very ingenious treati&s;e on the Theory and Management of Ulcers, mu&s;t be admired by every one who e&s;teems the profe&s;&s;ion of &s;urgery; but it is to be lamented that he has not <HI>particularly</HI> treated on the management of ulcers in the leg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We will fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e an ulcer of but &s;mall extent, its appearance what is u&s;ually termed clean, the edges thin, with little or no callo&s;ity, and the &s;urrounding parts but &s;lightly di&s;coloured: the u&s;ual dre&s;&s;ing in this ca&s;e, is dry lint, immediately on the &s;ore, and over this a plai&s;ter of calaminaris cerate,
<PB N="6" REF="5">which extends two fingers breadth every way from the edges of the &s;ore, over this a ban|dage; on removing this dre&s;&s;ing once in the day, the lint &s;hall appear covered with thick white matter, the pain, which was at fir&s;t but &s;light, go off; yet the &s;ore frequently heals but very &s;lowly. To what cau&s;e are we to a&s;&s;ign this &s;low progre&s;s in healing? Is there &s;ome con&s;titutional fault, or are the dre&s;&s;ings the mo&s;t proper? If the fault was entirely con|&s;titutional, may we &s;uppo&s;e the healing would not have thus far advanced? Yet how can &s;uch mild applications be improper? Is the conjecture improbable, that the plai&s;ter of the &s;ize before mentioned, (which is con&s;tantly applied) by retaining the per&s;pirable fluid, keeps the cuticular ve&s;&s;els over which it is placed, in too relaxed a &s;tate? and if this be the ca&s;e, would not a compre&s;s, wet with vegeto mineral water, or any other mild a&s;tringent liquor, applied three or four times a day over the lint, &s;ooner heal the &s;ore,
<PB N="7" REF="6">when advanced to this &s;tate? It may be urged &s;uch &s;ore u&s;ually heals by the u&s;e of lint and cerate; but the time, often more than a few weeks, nece&s;&s;ary to effect this, is certainly too long to &s;ubject our patient to an incon|venience, provided any quicker, and equally &s;afe mode can be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tate of ulcera|tion. We now con&s;ider an ulcer as in a foul &s;tate, with a thick callous margin, a thin irritating dark coloured di&s;charge, and the &s;urrounding parts to a con&s;iderable extent inflamed, attended with much pain. The u&s;ual mode of treating this kind of ulcer, is to foment the part twice a day with flan|nel wrung dry from a decoction of worm|wood, chamomile flowers, &amp;c. then apply &s;ome terebinthinate dige&s;tive &s;pread on lint, immediately on the &s;ore, over this a large plain&s;ter of yellow ba&s;ilicon. Sometimes a com|mon bread and milk poultice only is applied, (which &s;hould be renewed at lea&s;t three or
<PB N="8" REF="7">four times in twenty-four hours) but which ever of the&s;e means are u&s;ed, the foulne&s;s of the &s;ore in a few days is u&s;ually much re|moved, the di&s;charge wears a better appear|ance, and the naked fibres appear of a more florid colour; yet &s;till the callo&s;ity of the edges continues as in its fir&s;t &s;tate, and tho' the pain is le&s;s, the &s;urrounding parts wear nearly the &s;ame appearance. If the bread and milk poultice has been applied, it is u&s;ually di&s;continued when the &s;tate of the &s;ore is thus altered, and either dry lint, or lint &s;pread with &s;ome dige&s;tive ointment, is applied over the &s;ore once or twice a day, and this covered with a large yellow ba&s;i|licon plai&s;ter. To remove the callo&s;ity, a &s;mall quantity of &s;trong mercurial ointment, daily rubbed on the hardened edges, is by &s;ome much recommended; but as the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els in parts thus hardened, may be con&s;idered almo&s;t impervious, we have no good rea&s;on to expect this will effect any
<PB N="9" REF="8">con&s;iderable alteration. A catapla&s;m of figs, beat fine with a little honey, &s;pread thick on lint, and applied on the edges of the &s;ore twice a day, &s;o as to cover rather more than the callo&s;ity, by its &s;oftening quality and ac|tion on the contiguous &s;urrounding parts, would probably effect a more &s;peedy removal of the hardne&s;s. But if after applying this catapla&s;m for &s;ome days, the edges of the &s;ore appear in nearly the &s;ame &s;tate, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to rub them with lunar cau&s;tic either once a day, or every other day, in order to de&s;troy the callo&s;ity. It mu&s;t here be un|der&s;tood that the patient u&s;es every endeavour to enjoy the advantage of entire re&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of ulceration being generally con|&s;idered as attended with &s;ome con&s;titutional fault, while the means to heal the &s;ore are em|ployed, &s;ome medicine is u&s;ually directed to be taken daily. If there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e connected with the venereal virus, or a &s;crophulous taint, it is generally called
<PB N="10" REF="9">Scorbutic; not as the term is connected with the &s;ea &s;curvy, but that general ap|pellation u&s;ed for mo&s;t kinds of eruption, di&s;colourations of the &s;kin, &amp;c. The me|dicines u&s;ually given for this purpo&s;e are Aethiop's mineral, cinnabar of antimony, &amp;c. Aethiop's mineral has, by being long in u&s;e, obtained credit with &s;ome, as a re|medy capable of effecting great changes in the con&s;titution; but when it is con&s;idered that &s;ulphur joined with mercury almo&s;t en|tirely de&s;troys its active qualities, little good can be expected from the admini&s;tration of this medicine. Indeed we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, the efficacy de&s;ired is &s;eldom if ever obtained. Cinnabar of antimony, as a com|po&s;ition of a &s;imilar kind, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have no better effect. Nitre is another me|dicine &s;ometimes admini&s;tered; this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing a &s;edative quality, often powerfully abating inflammation, and acting, in a proper do&s;e, as a diuretic, is doubtle&s;s in
<PB N="11" REF="10">many ca&s;es an excellent remedy. But other qualities &s;eem to be wanted for the cure of this kind of ulcer. Calomel like|wi&s;e, which is &s;ometimes given in a &s;mall do&s;e for three or four nights, and then worked off with a bri&s;k purge, tho' fre|quently repeated, generally fails of produc|ing the beneficial effect required.</P>
<P>If the con&s;titutional fault now treated of, be a too impoveri&s;hed and acrimonious &s;tate of the fluids, and from hence di&s;po&s;ition to relaxation of the mu&s;cular fibres, the con|&s;equence, we have a mo&s;t noble and almo&s;t certain corroberant in the Peruvian bark; but this is likewi&s;e given to remove the con|&s;titutional fault, and forward the healing of the ulcer, yet too frequently, not with the wi&s;hed for effect. May it then be &s;uppo&s;ed, tho' this invaluable medicine will give tone to the relaxed fibres, the fluids are not brought to that bal&s;amic &s;tate nece&s;&s;ary for completely healing the &s;ore? Therefore, while we ad|mini&s;ter
<PB N="12" REF="11">the bark, a do&s;e of which &s;hould be taken three or four times a day, a more nu|tritive diet than is u&s;ually allowed, appears in a great degree nece&s;&s;ary. Half an ounce of i&s;ingla&s;s di&s;&s;olved in a pint of milk, and drank daily in &s;mall quantities, would probably afford great benefit to tho&s;e patients who&s;e circum&s;tances in life have nece&s;&s;itated them to live &s;paringly, or on food but &s;lightly nutritive. A &s;mall gla&s;s of mountain, or any other generous wine, allowed three or four times a day, might likewi&s;e prove of con|&s;iderable benefit; or &s;alep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That friend of human kind, and excellent phy&s;ician, Dr. Percival, in his e&s;&s;ays medical and experimental, ob|&s;erves, <Q>"The re&s;torative, mucilaginous, and demulcent qualities of the orchis root [&s;alep] render it of con&s;iderable u&s;e in various di&s;ea&s;es;"</Q> and that <Q>"Salep is &s;aid to con|tain the greate&s;t quantity of vegetable nouri&s;hment in the &s;malle&s;t bulk."</Q></NOTE> given to the quan|tity of half an ounce daily in a decoction<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The manner of preparing this decoction, is as follows: Boil two ounces of dried burdock roots cut &s;mall, in four pints of water to three; then add half an ounce of pow|dered &s;alep, continue the boiling until only a quart of liquor remains, which pour through a fine &s;trainer for u&s;e.</NOTE> of
<PB N="13" REF="12">burdock root, a coffee-cup full to be drank frequently as common liquor, appears likely to much a&s;&s;i&s;t the other means employed.</P>
<P>From the dre&s;&s;ings daily applied, and the alteration induced in the con&s;titution by ad|mini&s;tering Peruvian bark, and allowing a more nutritive diet, we will &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ore is become le&s;s, the callous edges nearly re|moved, the di&s;charge thicker, and the pain much gone off, but &s;till the &s;urrounding parts di&s;coloured; yet altho' we are thus far advanced towards the cure, after &s;ome days the &s;ore often will appear to heal no further, and not unfrequently part of the new cover|ing di&s;appear, and the &s;ore become enlarged. Are we to &s;eek a remedy, in this &s;ituation of the di&s;ea&s;e, from internal means? Or are dif|ferent topical applications likely to alter this &s;tate of the ulcer, and induce it to heal? No one will doubt the propriety of continuing, or even encrea&s;ing the do&s;e of a medicine, before found &s;erviceable. But are topical applications,
<PB N="14" REF="13">generally con&s;idered, &s;o u&s;eful as there is rea&s;on to believe they would &s;ometimes prove, at lea&s;t are they attended to with that care which in &s;ome ca&s;es they perhaps de&s;erve? Dry lint on the &s;ore, over this a plai&s;ter, is the u&s;ual ap|plication when the ulcer (however deep) ap|pears clean; but may not the plai&s;ter in this ca&s;e produce the &s;ame inconvenience as before alluded to? And may we hope &s;ome other application, immediately on the naked fibres, will a&s;&s;i&s;t the more &s;peedy healing the ulcer? Slightly touching the &s;ore with the elixir of aloes twice a day, then applying fine dry lint, or lint &s;pread &s;lightly over with a mild cerate, and over this a compre&s;s, wet with vegeto mineral water, (which compre&s;s may be wetted more frequently, if it grows dry) would probably contribute much to the more &s;peedily effecting this purpo&s;e. Or u&s;ing the lint and compre&s;s wet with the vegeto mineral water as above, after &s;prinkling the &s;ore with a powder compo&s;ed
<PB N="15" REF="14">of three parts &s;affron, carefully dried and finely powdered, and one part powdered myrrh, or with powdered &s;affron only, (which I have rea&s;on to believe, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a vulnerary quality, hitherto but little attend|ed to) might much a&s;&s;i&s;t our attaining the de&s;irable end&mdash;a &s;ound and compleat cure.</P>
<P>In the &s;tate of the ulcer, as at fir&s;t de&s;cribed, the pain will always make our patient ready to comply with our reque&s;t, to re&s;t the limb as much as po&s;&s;ible; but when the &s;ore is brought to a le&s;s painful &s;tate, may we con&s;ider re&s;t then not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, particularly if the roller, which &s;hould be con&s;tantly worn, is properly applied from the foot to the knee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Roller I have u&s;ed for a long time before reading Mr. Underwood's Treati&s;e upon Ulcers of the Legs, &amp;c. was always made of thin flannel, though not formed in the manner he thus directs: <Q>"The kind of roller is to be con&s;idered, which ought to be made of the thinne&s;t Welch flannel, not thicker than coar&s;e linen, which advantages no linen can have; it not only being &s;ofter, &s;itting ea&s;ier, and making no plaits on the &s;kin, but is ela&s;tic to a very con|&s;iderable degree. This is greatly increa&s;ed by its being torn acro&s;s and &s;ewed together &s;elvage ways (the hard &s;el|vage thread being fir&s;t cut off) whereby the roller is made to yield to every motion and varying &s;hape of the limb."</Q> Great merit is certainly due to Mr. Underwood for his valuable communications on the treatment of ulcerated legs, &amp;c. and his candour will doubtle&s;s excu&s;e the hope expre&s;&s;ed in my conclu&s;ion of this &s;ubject; a &s;ubject which I humbly conceive will &s;till admit of many additions, before perfection be attained in the modes of treatment.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>If the danger of healing an old ulcer, is urged again&s;t our endeavours to generally compleat a cure&mdash;if it is remarked that lo&s;s of appetite, pain in the &s;tomach and bow|els, a&s;thma, and other ill con&s;equences have been ob&s;erved to follow the entirely &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing a di&s;charge from the leg, that has been of long continuance; may we &s;uppo&s;e (as the proce&s;s of healing is u&s;ually &s;low) that careful attention to the &s;tate of our patient's health, particularly when the di&s;|charge is much le&s;&s;ened, will enable us to judge of the &s;afety of perfectly healing the &s;ore, or direct us only to continue our endea|vours, until it is brought to &s;uch a &s;tate as to be but &s;lightly inconvenient. When the healing is far advanced, and after an i&s;&s;ue
<PB N="17" REF="16">made in the thigh has di&s;charged freely for &s;everal days; &s;hould our patient frequently find pain in the &s;tomach and bowels, which although relieved by a mild purge, or other proper medicine, &s;oon again returns&mdash;&s;hould &s;hortne&s;s of breath, or particular la&s;&s;itude be ob&s;erved on any change of the weather, or increa&s;e of exerci&s;e&mdash;&s;hould want of u&s;ual appetite follow, or nau&s;ea often recur; may we not con&s;ider the&s;e &s;ufficient indications to de&s;i&s;t from the con&s;tant u&s;e of healing ap|plications, and in their place &s;ometimes apply immediately on the part a little mild dige&s;tive ointment &s;pread on lint, in order to continue the di&s;charge and keep the ulcer in &s;uch &s;tate as to be but in a &s;mall degree in|convenient. On the other hand, if as the cure advances no difference is ob&s;erved in our patient's &s;tate of health, but what is ra|ther for the better, may not our endea|vours to completely heal the &s;ore be &s;afely pur&s;ued? Which if we are &s;o happy to ef|fect,
<PB N="18" REF="17">leaving an i&s;&s;ue in the thigh, to be carefully attended to for &s;ome time, will make us ea&s;y re&s;pecting any future con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>Could we in every ca&s;e of ulcerated legs, have the happine&s;s to make a &s;afe and perfect cure, what a large portion of human mi&s;ery would be removed: How many a father on whom a numerous family depends for &s;up|port, if freed from pain, would earn the bread of comfort! What plea&s;ure would many mothers find in performing the nece&s;|&s;ary ta&s;k of care for their, perhaps, yet ten|der offspring: Or, &s;uppo&s;ing the parents free from what would be their pride, in be|holding their children in the full u&s;e of their limbs! If I appear too earne&s;t, the im|portance of the &s;ubject, I hope, will plead in my excu&s;e, this di&s;ea&s;e too frequently at pre&s;ent, like a &s;able cloud &s;preading a gloom over the field, &s;o &s;plendidly enlightened by the many modern improvements in Surgery.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>Having con&s;idered the means likely to be beneficial to tho&s;e ulcers in the leg to which the mo&s;t virtuous are alike liable with tho&s;e who are regardle&s;s of irregularities; as in the latter the <HI>venereal virus</HI> is often found to accompany or produce the ulceration, &s;ome attention to this &s;tate of the ca&s;e becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary. If the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is confe&s;&s;ed we have then certain grounds to proceed on, but (as too often is the ca&s;e with females) if the cau&s;e is concealed, although the appear|ance of the &s;ore to the per&s;on much con|ver&s;ant in practice, and particularly if any copper-coloured &s;pots appear in the other parts of the limb, will give almo&s;t a certain information of the nature of the ca&s;e, yet the delicacy of &s;uch a circum&s;tance requires that we proceed with caution.</P>
<P>For the Venereal virus we have the hap|pine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s a true &s;pecific in mercury, and as the mode of admini&s;tering this va|luable medicine mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<PB N="20" REF="19">known to every &s;urgeon, any hint on this point may be con&s;idered as &s;uperfluous; But with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the future con&s;ideration of tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;o &s;trongly a&s;&s;ert the efficacy of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate in the advanced &s;tages of the veneral di&s;ea&s;e, I would beg leave to &s;ay, the re&s;ult of my frequently ad|mini&s;tering it has rather tended to prove it very uncertain; for although external &s;ymp|toms will from its u&s;e generally &s;oon di&s;|appear, and health &s;eem to return, yet after &s;ome time the patient will not unfrequently find the di&s;ea&s;e again appear, without having the lea&s;t cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e it is renewed.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of mercury for this kind of ul|ceration, appears indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; and if half an ounce of i&s;ingla&s;s di&s;&s;olved in a pint of milk is taken once or twice a day during the cour&s;e, It may afford great a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>The efficient cau&s;e by a judicious mer|curial cour&s;e being removed, the ulcer u&s;ually
<PB N="21" REF="20">changes its &s;tate, as in the manner before de&s;cribed; and although the degree of cal|lo&s;ity in the&s;e ca&s;es is u&s;ually greater, we have rea&s;on to hope a cure may be effected by the u&s;e of the &s;ame external means. Two or three do&s;es of Peruvian bark likewi&s;e, taken daily when the &s;ore is brought to a healing &s;tate may much a&s;&s;i&s;t the more effec|tual recovery of health, and prove of great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in compleatly healing the ulcer.</P>
<P>Another yet more formidable evil too fre|quently accompanies or is the cau&s;e of ulcers in the leg&mdash;a &s;crophulous taint. This kind of ulceration too generally gives us rea&s;on to lament that no <HI>certain</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be found, by whatever means we attempt relief. May we &s;uppo&s;e this evil has been more known to late generations? Or may we agree with tho&s;e who conjecture that the <HI>venereal virus</HI> in the parent can operate to tran&s;mit a &s;cro|phulous taint to their children's children? what more than &s;ingle cau&s;e have we then to
<PB N="22" REF="21">lament "That dreadful malady, the &s;evere&s;t &s;courge with which in this life offended Heaven cha&s;tens the indulgence of criminal de&s;ire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by that late elegant writer Dr. Robert&s;on, in his hi&s;tory of America.</NOTE>" ever was tran&s;planted from Ame|rican &s;oil: for &s;urely, adding this calamity to tho&s;e which formerly embittered human life, has almo&s;t formed a counterbalance to all the benefits Europe can derive from the di&s;|covery of the new world.</P>
<P>But let us not too darkly &s;hade the &s;cene&mdash; If it too frequently happens that endeavours to cure the Scrophula are un&s;ucce&s;sful, in &s;ome ca&s;es experience teaches the man of practice, much benefit may be obtained, and we will indulge the hope, that to &s;ome fu|ture age will be known that <HI>certain</HI> remedy which hitherto has been &s;ought with &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="22">we have a certain a&s;&s;urance of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e; but as ulcers in the leg are often truly &s;crophulous when no tumour of this kind has appeared, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to enquire what peculiar appearance &s;uch &s;ores wear, that we may not &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e of this cla&s;s which are in no degree connected with &s;crophula, or be di&s;couraged in our attempts when we find an ulcer that from <HI>neglect</HI> only is brought to &s;uch &s;tate that the means &s;uc|ce&s;sful in other ca&s;es, are long before they produce any favourable alteration. The edges of &s;crophulous ulcers have never that degree of callo&s;ity ob&s;ervable in other ulcers; but, on the contrary, appear lax and &s;pongy; the naked fibres have not u&s;ually &s;o florid an appearance, and the di&s;charge, even when the &s;ore appears clean, is u&s;ually thin and ill|conditioned: if the &s;ore enlarges, it is more ha&s;tily than in other ulcers, and the fungous appearance of the marginal fibres is invariably to be ob&s;erved; the mu&s;cles of the whole
<PB N="24" REF="23">limb when the ulcer has been of long con|tinuance likewi&s;e appear much relaxed.</P>
<P>That the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are the imme|diate &s;eat of &s;crophula is an opinion now ge|nerally received; that debility of the con&s;ti|tution in general, is always connected with this di&s;ea&s;e, attentive ob&s;ervation will cer|tainly convince us: but much more I fear is nece&s;&s;ary to be known before we become able to direct with certainty, our means for relief. It may not however be improper be|fore any thing is &s;aid on the external treat|ment, to pay &s;ome attention to the internals u&s;ually admini&s;tered. Aethiop's mineral, and cinnabar of antimony, which &s;ome writers much recommend, have been attended to with re&s;pect to their u&s;e, in tho&s;e ulcers u&s;ually termed &s;corbutic; burnt &s;pung much re|commended by Dr. Mead in this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eems to have little better claim to our at|tention; decection of the woods and me|dicated lime-water that are frequently &s;er|viceable
<PB N="25" REF="24">in cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, appear not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the efficacy here required; mercurials in &s;crophulous ca&s;es, almo&s;t certainly fail of producing any la&s;ting good effect, and the various preparations of antimony in this di&s;|ea&s;e, lo&s;e their force; even that lately &s;o very fa&s;hionable medicine, extract of hem|lock, has perhaps never been found to en|tirely eradicate this di&s;ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the powers &s;ome boa&s;t it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, even of curing cancers; Poudre unique has not come much within my ob&s;ervation, but admitting a &s;uperlative efficacy in this compo&s;ition, its extravagant price mu&s;t ever prove a barrier to its general u&s;e; for who in the common line of life can afford to give more than the price of gold for <HI>copper,</HI> in whatever cu|rious form it is offered? Tho&s;e who profe&s;s a good will to mankind, certainly mi&s;s the aim they intend, if their own intere&s;t &s;trongly glares in that light where it &s;hould be only ju&s;t di&s;cernable; but it is far from the writer's
<PB N="26" REF="25">wi&s;h to pa&s;s an invidious comment on any one.</P>
<P>If we attend to the efficacy of vegitables, may the conjecture be indulged, that modern practice does not &s;ufficiently pay attention to the advantages to be derived from them. It appears, the field furni&s;hed our forefathers with almo&s;t the whole of the means they employed in the removal of di&s;ea&s;es; &s;ome will, perhaps, &s;uppo&s;e di&s;ea&s;e was not to them &s;o formidable as it at pre&s;ent often appears. It certainly is not improbable, that modern luxury &s;tates our account more on the debtor &s;ide: but allowing this, and that chemi&s;try furni&s;hes more powerful and &s;peedy remedies in many ca&s;es, it is more than probable ex|perience would inform us many now neglect|ed herbs po&s;&s;e&s;s great efficacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"The &s;imple herb <HI>plantain,</HI> blunts the venomous bite of the <HI>rattle-&s;nake,</HI> which would otherwi&s;e prove mortal." <BIBL><HI>Black's Hi&s;torical &s;ketch of Medicine and Surgery.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Dr. Arm|&s;trong in his account of the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="26">incident to children, de&s;cribing &s;crophulous tumours in the neck, &amp;c. has a pa&s;&s;age which I cannot refrain taking the freedom to tran|&s;cribe: "For &s;wellings of this kind, when taken in time, that is, before the &s;kin begins to be di&s;coloured, the be&s;t application that I have tried, is the juice of the root of &s;word|gra&s;s, or the yellow water-flag, <HI>(gladiolus luteus)</HI> rubbed well in upon the part two or three times a day. A &s;mall quantity of this juice recently expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;nuffed up the no&s;trils in a &s;hort time after, occa&s;ions a great heat in the cavities of the no&s;e, mouth, and throat, and a very plentiful di&s;charge of &s;aliva from the mouth and mucus from the no&s;e, as great of the former as if the patient were in the height of a &s;alivation, which con|tinues &s;ometimes for two or three hours or more; and I have heard of &s;ome very ob|&s;tinate chronical and periodical tooth-achs and head-achs having been removed by this di&s;charge, after a variety of other remedies
<PB N="28" REF="27">had been tried in vain. This effect of the juice on the &s;alivary glands when &s;nuffed up the no&s;e, fir&s;t induced me to try it externally upon &s;crophulous &s;wellings, and I have had the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving it to an&s;wer ex|tremely well, even upon &s;ome tumours of long &s;tanding. It has occurred to me &s;ome|times to try it inwardly as an alterative upon &s;ome &s;crophulous patients, but I have not yet done it. I mu&s;t not forget to mention, that the larger and older the root is from which the juice is expre&s;&s;ed, and the deeper its colour, the &s;tronger and more efficacious is the medicine." My u&s;e of this remedy to &s;crophulous tumours has not been equally fortunate with what the Doctor relates, but I mu&s;t be free to own, the tumours to which it was applied, had been of very long &s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>What effect the application of vervain root in the manner directed by Mr. Morley would produce in this &s;pecies of ulcer, I
<PB N="29" REF="28">cannot attempt to &s;ay; &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the portion of faith nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who make the application, as well as tho&s;e to whom it is applied; yet I feel con|viction of the goodne&s;s of Mr. Morley's heart, and the &s;incerity of his intention in favouring the world with his publication on &s;crophulous complaints.</P>
<P>From this digre&s;&s;ion, the &s;ubject treated on cannot, perhaps, be better re&s;umed than by ob&s;erving the virtue of Peruvian bark when joined with &s;oluble tartar; the do&s;e &mdash;two &s;cruples or half a dram of each, given three or four times a day; this medicine regularly taken for &s;ome weeks, together with the u&s;e of the burdock decoction with &s;alep, would probably be found to produce much benefit in the general appearance of this di&s;ea&s;e, as well as the kind of ulcer now treated on.</P>
<P>The common dre&s;&s;ing&mdash;dry lint on the &s;ore, and this covered with a large plai&s;ter of
<PB N="30" REF="29">ba&s;ilicon or &s;ome mild cerate, is generally the whole external means employed, when the &s;ore, whatever be its extent, appears clean. But may the claim before urged for topical applications be again applied here? The re|laxed appearance of the &s;ore mu&s;t certainly be&s;peak all applications of the emollient cla&s;s improper, and direct our attention to tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a different quality. Elixir of aloes applied on the &s;ore twice every day, as before mentioned, and this covered with a compre&s;s wet with mindererus's &s;pirit, in two ounces of which is di&s;&s;olved two drams of crude &s;al armoniac, would probably prove very u&s;eful; or camphire powdered very fine and &s;lightly &s;prinkled over the whole &s;ore twice a day, over this &s;ome fine lint, and the whole covered with a compre&s;s wet with vegeto mineral water, might &s;till more a&s;&s;i&s;t the healing of the &s;ore. I have had the &s;a|tisfaction to ob&s;erve a &s;ore in the leg that almo&s;t daily enlarged, where the fibres ap|peared
<PB N="31" REF="30">pale and much relaxed, and the di&s;|charge was thin, &s;harp and irritating, by the u&s;e of camphire in this manner, &s;oon wear a more favourable appearance, the fibres &s;oon became of a more florid colour, the di&s;|charge by degrees become thicker, the &s;ore daily mended, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of bark, &amp;c. internally, became perfectly well.</P>
<P>The wide field of medicine, I am well aware, affords ample room for propo&s;ing many more u&s;eful hints than come within my ob&s;ervation on this &s;ubject; nor have I attempted to de&s;cribe ulceration in all its different appearances. The hope of in|ducing &s;ome more able hand to favour the world with a more certain mode of treating ulcers in the leg than what at pre&s;ent has come in general u&s;e, being what principally di&s;po&s;ed me to attempt this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay, if by its publication the &s;malle&s;t portion of infor|mation be contributed, my endeavours will be abundantly repaid.</P>
