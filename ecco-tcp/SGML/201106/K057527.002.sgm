<ARGUMENT>
<P>De&s;cription of the family.&mdash;The &s;oldier gives an account of his life.&mdash;He en|deavours to prove that honour is a &s;uf|ficient &s;ub&s;titute for happine&s;s.&mdash;I re|tire to bed.&mdash;Join the &s;oldier and his family.&mdash;More ways of living than one.&mdash;The &s;oldier's &s;tratagems to eke out a &s;canty pittance.&mdash;Their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as we had all retired within the cabin, our company was re|inforced by the arrival of the farmer's
<PB N="6" REF="4">
daughter, who had ju&s;t returned from a neighbouring fair, where &s;he had been to &s;ell &s;ome &s;pun-yarn, in which em|ployment her father and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of their time, in order to make a &s;mall addition, by their indu&s;try, to that pittance, to which it had plea&s;ed heaven to reduce them.</P>
<P>When we had a&s;&s;embled round the hearth, the loquacious &s;oldier, taking &s;ome tobacco from a leather pouch, which he carried in his pocket, between his finger and thumb, and depo&s;iting it in his lower jaw, between his lip and his teeth, began to inform us who he was, and the rea&s;ons that had induced him to pay a vi&s;it to that part of the country.&mdash;"When I fir&s;t took it in my head to enter the army as a pri|vate," &s;ays the &s;oldier, "I was about
<PB N="7" REF="5">
the age and &s;ize of this here lad," at the &s;ame time giving me a violent pat on the head.&mdash;I remember the time ju&s;t as well as if it was but ye&s;terday, though, may hap, I haven't made many a hard campaign &s;ince that time;&mdash;but no matter for that, every man isn't born with a &s;ilver &s;poon in his mouth; and, if &s;o be as how I've done my duty, why an't I as good as another? hey, father!" &s;ays he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the ho&s;t;&mdash;"but, damme, what &s;igni|fies?&mdash;it will be all the &s;ame a hun|dred years hence, as Corporal Crab u&s;ed to &s;ay.&mdash;Well, as I was &s;ay|ing, when I li&s;ted in the army, it was in the month of June, at Clonmel, in the county of Tiperary, and a fine body of men our regiment were, damme, as ever faced an enemy in
<PB N="8" REF="6">
the field of battle.&mdash;But this won't do, by G&mdash;d!&mdash;ram me into a gin|&s;hop (as our corporal u&s;ed to &s;ay) but I'm growing confoundedly dry; I'm none of your fellows, damme, not I, that can talk without drink|ing;&mdash;here," &s;aid the talkative &s;on of Mars, holding out the mug, "take this and fill it full of the righteous!&mdash; I can't do without it, by the lord Har|ry;&mdash;I mu&s;t wet the whi&s;tle;&mdash;I'm ju&s;t as dull, if I want drink, as a <HI>Moun&s;eer</HI> without <HI>&s;oup meagre.</HI> &mdash; Aye, that's a brave girl!" &s;ays he, taking the mug from the young woman, "come, "my la&s;s," putting the ve&s;&s;el to his mouth, here's long life to you if you die to-morrow, as our corporal u&s;ed to &s;ay.&mdash;What was I &s;aying when I left off?&mdash;Oh! I recollect.&mdash;Why,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
we were ordered to Cork, that we might be in readine&s;s to meet the tran&s;ports, which were coming round there, from the Channel, to take us, and five more regiments, to North America, to fight the rebels.&mdash;We got got into the boats at three in the morning, and fell down the river to the &s;hips that were moored off Kin|&s;ale, and a brave &s;et of boys there was, d'ye &s;ee, as ever the &s;un &s;hone upon.&mdash;We mu&s;tered, I remember, near four thou&s;and, though, I believe, four hundred never lived to return; but no matter for that, we mu&s;t all die &s;ome time or other; and isn't better to die in battle, with a bullet through your head, fighting for your king and country, (as our corporal u&s;ed to &s;ay,) than to &s;neak into the
<PB N="10" REF="8">
other world with a 'potecary's &s;hop in your guts? &mdash; Damme, I'm no flincher;&mdash;here's your good health, daddy," &s;ays the &s;oldier, drinking.&mdash; I remember," continues this &s;on of gunpowder, "we had a quick pa&s;&s;age. We cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, and arrived at New-York ju&s;t forty days after the time of our embarkation. &mdash; I recollect too that our general would &s;carcely give us time to refre&s;h our&s;elves after the voyage, when he ordered us up into the country, where we marched and countermarched after the enemy; but I don't know how it was, but, damme, we always arrived a day too late;&mdash;but no matter for that, &mdash; here's &s;ucce&s;s to the army," &s;ays he, drinking, and afterwards giving me the mug;&mdash;"come, you dog," &s;ays
<PB N="11" REF="9">
he, <Q>why don't you drink?&mdash;why, your'e down in the mouth;&mdash;damme, you'll never grow tall if you don't drink.</Q> In compliance with his &s;olicitations I took another draught; while I was per|forming of which he kept crying, <Q>Take a good pull;&mdash;by G&mdash;d it's better for you than mother's milk.&mdash;Well, as I was &s;aying, our arms were idle, for want of u&s;e, till we were ordered to force the trenches of the rebels at Bunker's-hill.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>At the mention of Bunker's-hill, I perceived the tears, trickling from the eyes of the venerable old landlord, chace one another
<Q>"In big, round, drops, adown his furrow'd face."</Q>
"Why, what's the matter, father?" &s;ays the &s;oldier.&mdash;Ah!" replies the ho&s;t, "I lo&s;t a &s;on in that engagement, who,
<PB N="12" REF="10">
had he been living, would have &s;o|laced and relieved me in my old days."&mdash;"What was his name?" &s;ays the &s;oldier.&mdash;"John Fo&s;ter," &s;ays the other.&mdash;"Jack Fo&s;ter!" &s;ays the knight of the brown mu&s;ket; &mdash; "by G&mdash;d I knew him as well as my own brother;&mdash;he belonged to our grena|diers, and as clever a fellow he was as ever &s;tood in &s;hoe-leather.&mdash;I re|member he was &s;hot through the heart as he was leaping into the Yankees trenches.&mdash;Why, man, he and I were comrades, and were quartered together at Peg Brown's, who kept a huck&s;ter's &s;hop in Bo&s;ton."&mdash;At this part of the &s;tory the old man's faculties for&s;ook him, and, overcome by grief, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his daughter, after wi&s;hing us a good night's re&s;t, he retired to bed.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="11">"It was in Bo&s;ton," continues the &s;oldier, "that I picked up my wife, and a clever b&mdash;tch &s;he is as ever pillaged a field of battle.&mdash;She was formerly married to a &s;erjeant of our regiment, but, having his head &s;hot off by a cannon-ball, why, damme, the next day &s;he mar|ried me;&mdash;didn't you Moll?" &s;ays he, looking round for his companion, who had &s;tole away to bed with her child in the beginning of the &s;oldier's &s;tory;&mdash;<Q>why, what the devil is &s;he gone to bed already!&mdash;never out of her road by G&mdash;d!&mdash;but, as for that matter, Moll's an old campaigner, and, if ever &s;he wants any thing for a&s;king for, why, &s;he ought to be damned, as our corporal &s;ays;&mdash;&s;o here's my &s;ervice to you, my lad,</Q>
<PB N="14" REF="12">
&s;ays the facetious narrator, drinking again.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Well, how &s;hould you like to be a &s;oldier?</Q> continues my companion, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me.&mdash;I frankly replied, "Not at all:" at which he te&s;|tified a great deal of &s;urprize, and &s;aid, "Why, damme, have you no ambi|tion, you dog."&mdash;"Why no," I replied, "not to lo&s;e my limbs as you have done," the &s;oldier having but one arm.&mdash; "Oh! damne, this is a trifle," &s;ays he, lifting up the re|maining &s;tump; "be&s;ides, I &s;hould not have lo&s;t this but for a mere acci|dent." Upon my inquiring into the nature of it, he informed me that he lo&s;t his precious arm at the &s;pringing of a mine, where nine-tenths of the party he belonged to were blown to pieces in
<PB N="15" REF="13">
the air: upon which I told him, with|out any equivocation, that I had deter|mined never to be a &s;oldier, as I had a particular veneration for peace, health, and a whole &s;kin.&mdash;"I am &s;orry, my lad," &s;ays this modern Beli&s;arius, that you have &s;o pitiful a way of thinking;&mdash;by the Lord, you've no more idea of glory than a captain in the city militia, nor no more &s;pirit than a tailor.&mdash;Now, look at me;&mdash; you &s;ee me here a poor fellow, wa|ding through the world with one of my wings lopped off;&mdash;but no mat|ter for that, that's nothing more than the fortune of war, as our corporal u&s;ed to &s;ay, and is many a brave man's lot as well as mine, d'ye &s;ee; but, if &s;o be as how that hadn't been the ca&s;e, why, damme, by this
<PB N="16" REF="14">
time, I &s;hould have been a greater man than ever.&mdash;But I'll &s;ay nothing, for boa&s;ting is the language of pol|troons, and beneath a gentleman-&s;oldier to make u&s;e of; &s;o, my little hero, here's t'ye you," putting the mug to his mouth;&mdash;"oh! oh! dam|me," &s;ays he, turning the mug bot|tom upwards, "we are all aground by G&mdash;d!"&mdash;</P>
<P>By this time the young woman had returned from attending upon her fa|ther; and, intimating to the &s;tory-tell|ing &s;oldier that it was high time to think of going to bed, he thought proper to take the hint, and, a&s;king the girl to &s;hew him the hammock where his wife had turned in, he took up his &s;word and knap&s;ack, and, taking me by the hand, went out of the room, &s;cratching his
<PB N="17" REF="15">
head, and &s;haking him&s;elf all the way, to &s;olace his yoke-fellow, and give his tongue a re&s;pite until morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the beams of Phoebus pe|netrated through a little window, and informed the tenants of the cabin that it was time to ri&s;e, we all got up, and, having adju&s;ted our travelling baggage, began to march, taking the readie&s;t way to come into the high road that leads to the metropolis, and, the &s;oldier and his wife having the &s;ame place of de&s;tina|tion, we made a plea&s;ant party of three, and agreed to bear each other com|pany.</P>
<P>As we walked along, the &s;oldier took frequent opportunities of &s;ounding me upon the &s;trength of my pur&s;e, which when he learned was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, having only a crooked &s;ixpence and a
<PB N="18" REF="16">
few halfpence left, his looks became gloomy and thoughtful; and we were laying our heads together, to concert a plan for the procuring a comfortable breakfa&s;t, when we e&s;pied a carriage coming towards us, followed by three &s;ervants on hor&s;eback; at the &s;ight of which my companion's countenance be|gan to wear a plea&s;ant a&s;pect, and, bid|ding me make what ha&s;te I could be|hind a hedge, he told me that he would &s;oon procure &s;ome loo&s;e ca&s;h from the quality in the coach, which was ap|proaching us now very fa&s;t. I immedi|ately obeyed his orders, and got with great precipitation on the other &s;ide of the ditch, whence I re&s;olved to watch his motions narrowly, not knowing rightly what con&s;truction to put upon his words; but I was &s;oon relea&s;ed from my per|plexity
<PB N="19" REF="17">
by ob&s;erving my fellow-traveller, who had &s;o contrived to twi&s;t his left leg and the remaining arm, that he ap|peared, when limping, (which he did to admiration,) like a poor di&s;located wretch, who had not the power of put|ting his hand to his head, or helping him&s;elf in any manner whatever; and, in this woe-begone &s;tate, he placed him|&s;elf in the middle of the road, to be ready, at all points, to encounter the coach, and to lay warm &s;iege to the hearts of the company within.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the carriage arrived with|in a few paces of the &s;oldier, we all perceived with joy that the majority of the company were females, there being three young beauties within, accompa|nied by an elderly gentleman, whom we gue&s;&s;ed to be their father. But my
<PB N="20" REF="18">
&s;en&s;es were now occupied in ob&s;erving the artful manoeuvring of the jocund &s;on of Mars; for, limping up to the &s;ide of the carriage, to all appearance with infinite labour on his part, and, pulling off his hat, he acco&s;ted them in the following pitiable &s;train:&mdash;"Ah! my &s;weet young ladies, long life to you all;&mdash;and, can't you find, in your fair bo&s;oms, one &s;park of pity for a poor maimed &s;oldier, with a wife and &s;ix &s;mall children?"&mdash;"Yes, my good gentlewomen," cries his faith|ful help-mate, "this boy, in my arms, is one of them;&mdash;we left the other five, in the la&s;t town, behind us, as a pledge for nineteen-pence halfpenny." All true, upon my honour," &s;ays the &s;oldier; "and, unle&s;s you, or &s;ome other well-di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tians, con|tribute
<PB N="21" REF="19">
to our relief, we mu&s;t peri&s;h for hunger."&mdash;"How came you by tho&s;e wounds, friend?" &s;ays the gen|tleman in the coach.&mdash;"I lo&s;t this pre|cious limb," replies the &s;oldier, ex|hibiting his &s;tump, in the defence of an officer's wife, who was a pa&s;|&s;enger on board our tran&s;port, whom the Spaniards wanted to make a pri|&s;oner of, off Cape Fini&s;tere, becau&s;e, why, my &s;weet madam," &s;ays he to one of the young ladies, who had put her head out of the coach to look at the young child, "&s;he was like your|&s;elf, heaven ble&s;s you, as beautiful as Wenus."&mdash;"Ah! poor man," &s;ays the lady, evidently the more intere&s;ted in his &s;ucce&s;s by the &s;oldier's la&s;t well-timed remark upon her per&s;on.&mdash;"I and nine more of my comrades," continued the military impo&s;tor, "were
<PB N="22" REF="20">
taken pri&s;oners as we boarded the Spani&s;h frigate &s;word in hand, my good ma&s;ter, when we were put in irons till the &s;hip bore away for Bar|celona; then they hauled us a&s;hore, and we lay fifteen months, a fortnight, and three days, on the damp floor of a Spani&s;h pri&s;on, with no other co|vering than an old blanket, full of varmint; and no food but &s;tale o|nions, black bread, and &s;tinking wa|ter, your honour."</P>
<P>As the female heart is generally &s;u&s;|ceptible of the &s;oft pangs of &s;ympathy, when li&s;tening to the misfortunes of the brave, and the Iri&s;h ladies being equal to any upon earth in gentlene&s;s, genero&s;ity, and compa&s;&s;ion, it is no wonder that the young gentlewomen in the carriage &s;hould unite to lift the &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="23" REF="21">
burden of care and want from the &s;houlders of the gallant veteran;&mdash; indeed he had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed the relation of this well-wove catalogue of woe than they joined in concert to im|plore the old gentleman to give him a &s;hilling. Upon his expre&s;&s;ing an opi|nion that he thought it too much, they pulled out their pur&s;es, as in uni&s;on, and, gathering &s;ix pence a piece, threw it to the &s;oldier's wife, who picked it from the road, while he exhibited, in &s;ilent ge&s;ture, as if overpowered with their bounty, &s;ome well-conceived at|titudes, expre&s;&s;ive of pantomimic gra|titude, as the coach drove away from this accidental farce, which was per|formed &s;o much to the honour of the ladies, and, in my opinion, the degra|dation of the &s;oldier.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="22">My companion had the grace to watch until the carriage, by de&s;cending a hill, got intirely eclip&s;ed from our view, when calling to me to come forth, by the well-known &s;ummons of <Q>Fox, come out of your hole!</Q> I leaped into the path, on the &s;ide of the highway, while he replaced his knap&s;ack, (which he had taken off for the more conve|nient performance of the part he meant to play,) and, after buckling it in pro|per order, we &s;et off on our peregrina|tions once more, having no object now that could &s;o materially affect our con|templation as the fight of an alehou&s;e, for which we all looked out, with as much ardour as mariners do for land, when their water and provi&s;ions are ex|hau&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A proof of my credulity.&mdash;My inquiries are followed by a family quarrel.&mdash; A familiar dialogue in low life.&mdash;Ar|rive at a public hou&s;e.&mdash;Diamond cut diamond, or the &s;oldier too much for the I&s;raelite.&mdash;Arrive at a farm hou&s;e.&mdash; Another proof of the &s;oldier's addre&s;s in thieving.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE were all three pacing along the middle of the high road, to the tune of the <HI>Grenadier's March,</HI> which the &s;oldier was whi&s;tling, in quick time, while his eyes gli&s;tened with plea&s;ure at the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended his la&s;t manoeuvre: and every now and then he ca&s;t them towards me with a leer, as
<PB N="26" REF="24">
much as to &s;ay, <Q>Don't you think me a damned clever fellow?</Q> when I in|terrupted the progre&s;s of the tune, by ob&s;erving, that I was a little &s;urpri&s;ed how any per&s;on could retain &s;o great a &s;hare of animal &s;pirits, who had expe|rienced &s;o many, and &s;uch reiterated, hard&s;hips.&mdash; <Q>What, you mean the Spani&s;h pri&s;on, and the &s;tinking wa|ter?</Q> &s;ays my companion. Upon my replying, "Yes," he bur&s;t out into a fit of immoderate laughter, which he repeated, looking in my face, two or three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. At la&s;t, the violent part of his merriment &s;ub&s;iding, he a&s;ked me, with a grave countenance, if I believed it.&mdash;I told him, to be &s;ure; the circum&s;tances appeared to me &s;o na|tural that I could think of nothing el&s;e upon which he undeceived me, by telling
<PB N="27" REF="25">
me, very candidly, that the whole, from beginning to end, was neither more or le&s;s than a confounded lie.&mdash;"What, have you no children in pledge neither?" &s;aid I.&mdash;"Not one, upon my &s;oul," &s;aid he, "nor a brat in the world ex|cept this young ba&s;tard at my wife's back; and, if any one has a mind to take him into pledge, why, all that I &s;ay to the matter is, that I'll be damned if I'd take the trouble to redeem him in a hurry."&mdash;"How dare you call my child a ba&s;tard, you lob-lolly &s;on of a whore," cries the enraged wife.&mdash;"No abu&s;e, Moll," re|plies the other, holding up the remain|ing arm in a threatening po&s;ition, "be|cau&s;e why, d'ye &s;ee, if you do, I'll bring you to the halberd, by G&mdash;d; &s;o, mind me that, if you've a
<PB N="28" REF="26">
gard for your bones, my girl."&mdash; You and your halberd may go to hell together, you lou&s;y, &s;cabberoon, ra&s;|cal!" &s;ays the irritated trull, with her cheeks as red as &s;carlet with indignation, was it for this I left Jack Furlow, to take up with &s;uch a lying, thieving, pimping, mu&s;t-be-hanged, dog as you?&mdash;you know, you &s;coundrel, that I have it in my power to bring you to the gallows, you leering hound!"</P>
<P>At this la&s;t intimation the &s;oldier thought proper to appea&s;e his comrade with all the &s;oothing in his power:&mdash; "Come, come, Moll," &s;ays he, "why are you in &s;uch a damned pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash; you know I was but in je&s;t."&mdash;"Take care to crack your je&s;ts in proper time, then," replies &s;he;&mdash;"how does this youth know who or what
<PB N="29" REF="27">
I am?"&mdash;"Nay, nay, Moll," rejoins the &s;oldier, "there's enough &s;aid; if I I have affronted you, why, damme, I'm &s;orry for it."&mdash;"Ba&s;tard indeed!" mutters the lady.&mdash;"Why, &s;et in ca&s;e as how I did call Bob a ba&s;tard, Moll," replied the knight of the brown mu&s;ket, "you know the thing's natural enough."</P>
<P>I now took an opportunity of put|ting an end to this polite colloquy be|tween the &s;oldier and his trull, by point|ing to a public hou&s;e that awaited our entrance, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the place of di&s;putation. Here we found the landlord and a Jew pedlar in a warm conte&s;t about the origin of Chri&s;tianity, and they contended the matter with &s;o much heat, that, although I knew but very little of the &s;ubject, I readily con|cluded
<PB N="30" REF="28">
they were both in the wrong. The landlord was &s;o engaged in his argument, that he took no &s;ort of no|tice of our entering the kitchen until my comrade, by touching him upon the &s;houlder, put him in mind of his duty; upon which he &s;tarted up, and, beg|ging pardon for his inattention, placed us a long &s;tool by the fire-&s;ide, when we took our feats without any farther ceremony.&mdash;"What have you to drink, landlord?" &s;ays the &s;oldier.&mdash; Every thing," replies the other.&mdash; Have you any good whi&s;key? if you have, bring us a naggen apiece," &s;ays the dealer in gunpowder.&mdash;"I think, without vanity, I may &s;ay, that I have the very be&s;t whi&s;key in the country," rejoins Boniface, "I am &s;ure I ought, brother &s;oldier, for I pays
<PB N="31" REF="29">
ready money for every drop that comes into my hou&s;e;&mdash;no tru&s;t for me;&mdash;it was always a &s;aying of mine, Never tru&s;t but when needs mu&s;t."&mdash;"Oh! damn your palaver, landlord," cries the thir&s;ty &s;oldier, "bring but the &s;ort, d'ye &s;ee, and leave us to prai&s;e it;" upon which delicate &s;ugge&s;tion the ho&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;appeared.&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e, gentlemans, you have quite tired the gentlewomans," &s;ays the Jew, for &s;he looks mon&s;htrou&s;ly jaded."&mdash; Oh! by G&mdash;d, friend," &s;ays her helpmate, "it isn't &s;o ea&s;y a matter, as you may imagine, to knock Moll up."&mdash;"I only &s;hu&s;t &s;poke," &s;ays the Jew, "I hope no offen&s;h."&mdash;"Oh! not at all," &s;ays the other;&mdash;"dam|me, I like you;&mdash;give your hand, my hone&s;t I&s;raelite;&mdash;we mu&s;t be better
<PB N="32" REF="30">
acquainted."&mdash;"Witch all my heart," &s;ays the Jew.&mdash;"Will you join in our me&s;s? we're only taking a &s;up of the righteous this morning to warm our &s;tomachs, man;&mdash;here, take a ta&s;te," &s;ays the &s;oldier, giving the pewter mea|&s;ure to the Jew; which upon putting to his lips, he exclaimed, "I vow to God it i&s;h raw &s;pirits!"&mdash;"Raw!" replies the other, "aye, to be &s;ure; damme, I hate to &s;poil a good thing by mixing it;&mdash;but what have you got, Mor|decai, in that there box by your &s;ide?"&mdash;"Oh! a choich collection of knives, &s;hi&s;hhors, and ra&s;hors;&mdash; perhaps your lady would like a pair of &s;hi&s;hhors; I can &s;hew her a pair that&s;h fit for any lady in the land;&mdash; and, be&s;ides, here&s;h a nice pair of ear-rings; they are wa&s;hed, to be

<P>As we journied along the &s;oldier en|tertained the Jew with an account of his re&s;cuing a brother I&s;raelite in Ame|rica from the hands of &s;ome Cataban Indians, who had &s;eized him as he was cro&s;&s;ing a &s;wamp, in order to furni&s;h a detachment of light hor&s;e with trinkets,

<P>By this time we were overtaken by two empty cars, which were returning to the next town, after having carried &s;ome &s;traw to a gentleman's &s;eat up the country; and, being all of us a little inclined to be lazy, we procured a &s;eat upon the cars, through the mediation of the lame &s;oldier, for the promi&s;e of a quart of ale to the driver on our arrival at the next alehou&s;e. Accordingly we all
<PB N="38" REF="36">
mounted upon the vehicle, and, having had but an indifferent night's re&s;t, I pre&s;ently fell a&s;leep, and did not awake till I was pulled by the legs by my com|panion, who informed me that the cars would go no farther.</P>
<P>When I alighted from the carriage, I perceived the Jew and the &s;oldier's trull had got a con&s;iderable way before us; and, upon my expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome a|&s;toni&s;hment, my military companion told me, that they were re&s;olved to pu&s;h on &s;martly, to be able to reach the next town before dark, which place had been previou&s;ly &s;ettled by all parties as a ge|neral rendezvous.</P>
<P>As we trudged along, the merry-hearted &s;oldier did not fail to entertain me with &s;tories of &s;ieges and battles, and hair-breadth e&s;capes, interlarded with
<PB N="39" REF="37">
wittici&s;ms, which he delivered in a man|ner and dialect peculiar to him&s;elf.&mdash; "Some people," &s;ays he, "in my &s;itu|ation, would be damnably down in the mouth, without any money in my pocket, except a couple of crooked &s;ixpences, and not an ounce of pro|vi&s;ion, of any kind, in my knap&s;ack, for Moll and me to travel upwards of forty miles; but that does not af|fect me, for, when one expedient fails, d'ye &s;ee, why, I try another.&mdash; I am re&s;olved to get money when I want it; why, if I can get it hone&s;tly, d'ye &s;ee me, &s;o much the better, but at any rate I'll get it;&mdash;I'm none of your mealy-mouthed ra&s;cals that want to be a&s;ked twice to what's good.&mdash; But &s;top! what have we here!&mdash;&s;ome quality on hor&s;eback, by all that's
<PB N="40" REF="38">
lucky!"&mdash;and, after bidding me get out of the way, he took a piece of &s;oap from his pocket, and, placing it under his tongue, he watched till they were come pretty near, when he fell flat upon his back, and began to beat the ground with his head and hands, and pre&s;ently foamed at his mouth prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>As the &s;eeming violence of his di&s;|tre&s;s could not fail to attract their no|tice, they all rode up, while he acted the part of a man &s;orely afflicted with the epilep&s;y, or falling-&s;ickne&s;s. The company, (which con&s;i&s;ted of two ladies on hor&s;eback, attended by a young gen|tleman, about &s;ixteen years of age, and an officer in his uniform, with two &s;er|vants in livery,) &s;eeing the &s;uppo&s;ed melancholy condition of my comrade, ordered their &s;ervants to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor
<PB N="41" REF="39">
&s;oldier. As the bait had &s;ufficiently taken, and the company were viewing him with &s;trong marks of commi&s;era|tion, he thought proper to grow better, and, &s;itting up, affected to &s;tare about him, as not knowing where he was, which was attributed, by the pitying circle, to the convul&s;ions which he had undergone.</P>
<P>After being que&s;tioned as to his name, regiment, the cau&s;e of his di&s;order, and other corre&s;ponding circum&s;tances, he told them, with a look, in which he counterfeited all the wildne&s;s of ex|treme de&s;pair, the &s;ame account, word for word, that I heard him relate, on the &s;ame morning, to the company in the carriage, of the Spani&s;h pri&s;on, and its evils, and which, he afterwards a&s;&s;ured me, was a circum&s;tantial fal&s;ehood: but the man was right in one &s;en&s;e; for he
<PB N="42" REF="40">
told his tale of mi&s;ery with &s;uch an art|le&s;s affectation of truth and &s;incerity, that they threw him, in &s;ilver and half-pence, to the tune of &s;eventeen pence. After he had fervently prayed to heaven to ble&s;s them for their charity and be|nevolence, they rode off; and he &s;toop|ed with alacrity to gather the mi&s;applied offerings of their deluded liberality.</P>
<P>By the time he had pocketed the do|nations of the generous and humane travellers, who, doubtle&s;s, thought that they were doing an action peculiarly grateful to heaven, I jumped from the ditch, where I had lain hid during the &s;oldier's ma&s;terly operation, and joined him company; when, giving me a tre|mendous &s;lap upon the &s;houlder, he bur&s;t into a loud laugh, and a&s;ked me what I thought of the la&s;t manoeuvre.
<PB N="43" REF="41">
Upon my face denoting wonder and amazement, he cried out, with great exultation, <Q>Oh! you dog, if you keep me company, I'll teach you how to live;&mdash;it isn't done by working; no, damme, let the fooli&s;h part of the world work, and them that are fond of it, &s;ay I; for my part of the &s;tory, I never was in love with work in my life, and, what's more, by G&mdash;d, I don't believe I ever &s;hall.</Q></P>
<P>By the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of artifices which my con&s;cientious fellow-traveller had put in practice, to delude the generous and benevolent, &s;ince I had the good fortune to a&s;&s;ociate with him, I could not avoid looking upon him with a kind of horror and antipathy; ina&s;much as a knowledge of the infamous means he made u&s;e of, to awaken the &s;entiments of
<PB N="44" REF="42">
pity in the hearts of the good and worthy, would effectually &s;teel them in future again&s;t the &s;upplications of real mi&s;ery, whenever they might have the pain to encounter it: however, I had re&s;olved to di&s;gui&s;e my ideas of his character as much as po&s;&s;ible, and, by affecting a compliance with his humours, endea|voured to glean &s;ome whole&s;ome expe|rience, without endangering either my manners or my morals.</P>
<P>As we paced along to overtake our companions, who, by this time, had got the &s;tart of us by at lea&s;t a mile, we came within &s;ight of a farm-hou&s;e, to which the one-armed veteran propo&s;ed going, for the purpo&s;e of a&s;k|ing a ruddy-faced dam&s;el, who &s;tood at the door, the hour of the day. Upon his a&s;king the que&s;tion, &s;he replied,
<PB N="45" REF="43">
with great civility, that &s;he would go and &s;ee. The moment that the girl had turned her back, I ob&s;erved my colleague looking about the yard with the eyes of Argus. At la&s;t, e&s;pying a well-fed duck, that came waddling to|wards us, his chops watered with de&s;ire; and, bidding me wait at the door, he &s;tepped on one &s;ide, and, with an ad|mirable alertne&s;s, &s;truck the duck on the head with a thick oak &s;apling, which he carried with him by way of walking-&s;tick, and, ere I had well time to contem|plate the tran&s;action, he had it depo&s;ited in his knap&s;ack; when the young girl returned, and informed us it was almo&s;t &s;ix o'clock. The &s;oldier, finding that the evening was &s;o far advanced, told me that we mu&s;t &s;tir our &s;tumps, for that we had a good three miles to go

</ARGUMENT>
<P>PHOEBUS had ju&s;t de&s;cended to the enjoyment of his beloved Thetis when we arrived at the town of&mdash;, and found I&s;aac (for that was the Jew's name) watching for us at the door of a hou&s;e, dedicated for the purpo&s;e of en|tertaining the weary &s;ojourner.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="46">Upon the &s;oldier's making an inqui|ry after his female me&s;&s;mate, the Jew told him that &s;he was &s;moking her pipe by the kitchen-fire, whither we all re|paired immediately; and, as the demon, hunger, had cau&s;ed &s;trange commotions in the inte&s;tines of us all, it was propo|&s;ed by the Jew that we &s;hould get &s;ome|thing to allay it; upon which the pub|lican told our friend I&s;aac that he could give him as delicious a &s;lice of bacon as ever was broiled on a turf-&s;ire.&mdash;<Q>A &s;lice of vat!</Q> cries the enraged child of circumci&s;ion, who took this propo&s;al of the landlord as a direct in&s;ult.&mdash;"Why, a &s;lice of bacon," cries the other. &mdash; Gives me leave to tell you, &s;ir," re|plies the de&s;cendent of Mo&s;es, "that you are a very impertinent &s;hort of a fel|low."&mdash;"Why, I'll tell you what,

friend," &s;ays the ho&s;t, "'tis true, I'm obliged to every gentleman for their cu&s;tom; but what then? why, I won't receive uncivil language from the be&s;t man in the county; and, if you repeat &s;uch language again, friend, damme, I'll &s;have your face for you with an oaken razor," alluding to the Jew's beard, which ornamented his lower jaw from ear to ear, as black and bri&s;tly as a hog's back.&mdash;"Whatch that you &s;hay?" &s;ays the Jew, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, "you will &s;have me! may I never enter the &s;ynagogue alive, but if you touch a hair of my beard, but I'll"&mdash;"What will you do?" cries the landlord, &s;trut|ting up to him.&mdash;"Well done, I&s;aac," cries the &s;oldier, &s;lapping him on the back, and pu&s;hing him forward, <Q>never mind; by G&mdash;d, I'll &s;tand by you:</Q>
<PB N="50" REF="48">
which a&s;&s;urance of &s;upport &s;pirited the I&s;raelite &s;o far, that, going up to the landlord, with his arms enfolded, he repeats, <Q>Now, &s;hir, I &s;hay you are an impertinent fellow, and, moreoveri&s;h, I have a great mind</Q>&mdash;Here the Jew's &s;entence, like the &s;tory in Hudi|bras, was abruptly broke off in the mid|dle by the incivility of the publican, who, on hearing the word <HI>impertinent</HI> a &s;econd time, grappled a three-legged &s;tool that &s;tood in his way, with an in|tent to knock the I&s;raelite on the head; which I&s;aac perceiving, dropped in&s;tant|ly upon his knees, and was looking mo&s;t piteou&s;ly up to the &s;oldier for relief, when he received &s;uch a terrible kick in the mouth from his adver&s;ary, as fairly drove him four yards backward into the fire, where he lay, to all appearance, be|reft
<PB N="51" REF="49">
of life, with the blood gu&s;hing from his ears, mouth, and no&s;trils, and his head leaning again&s;t an iron pot, which hung over the fire with &s;ome potatoes boiling for the family.</P>
<P>When I perceived the dreadful i&s;&s;ue of this adventure, I got hold of one of poor I&s;aac's arms, and the &s;oldier taking hold of the other, we drew him out of the fire; but, he &s;till remaining motion|le&s;s, we depo&s;ited him upon &s;ome &s;traw, and then left him to recover his &s;en&s;es at lei&s;ure.&mdash;Meanwhile the &s;oldier, pull|ing the dead duck from his knap&s;ack, gave it to the ho&s;t to get dre&s;&s;ed, which office he &s;et about with wonderous ala|crity; when the maimed warrior ca&s;t his eye upon I&s;aac's box, which, taking to the window, he opened without cere|mony,
<PB N="52" REF="50">
and made free with a japanned tobacco-box, and a ca&s;e of razors.</P>
<P>We were &s;urrounding the fire, li&s;ten|ing to the remarks of the laughter-lo|ving veteran, which were all made at the expence of poor I&s;aac, when the landlord informed us that &s;upper was ready. We all obeyed the word of command in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and, entering into a &s;mall white-wa&s;hed room, &s;carcely high enough for any of us to &s;tand up|right, found the duck &s;moking on the table, encircled with a great quantity of potatoes, and accompanied with two quarts of fine ale, that mantled in the gla&s;s like genuine Burgundy.</P>
<P>As we were proceeding to an in&s;tant demolition of the purloined fowl, we heard I&s;aac calling out vociferou&s;ly, <Q>Were i&s;h my box&s;h? were i&s;h my
<PB N="53" REF="51">
box&s;h?</Q> upon which the &s;oldier went out, and, having wa&s;hed the I&s;raelite's face with a wet towel, prevailed upon him to come in, and &s;up upon a fine duck, which, he a&s;&s;ured him, upon his honour, his cou|&s;in, the brewer, had &s;ent him as a pre|&s;ent, when he heard he was in town.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;trength of this importu|nity, I&s;aac con&s;ented to make one at the me&s;s, and, having taken his &s;eat at the fe&s;tive board, every man began to play his part; and, indeed, we did it &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that, in le&s;s than ten mi|nutes, we had intirely cleared the table, not only of the duck, but of, at lea&s;t, a &s;tone weight of potatoes, which accom|panied the delicious mor&s;el by way of a damper.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, with attention, the cada|verous vi&s;age of the Jew, whenever the
<PB N="54" REF="52">
landlord entered the room, which changed from its natural hue very much, re&s;em|bling yellow oker, to that of a deadly pale; his lips quivered, and his little black eyes, (&s;hadowed with a mon&s;trous pair of overgrown eye-brows,) which appeared to be more than half buried in his &s;cull, were inflamed with malice and revenge; and indeed his whole frame &s;eemed to undergo an agitation that &s;ufficiently denoted the angui&s;h and per|turbation of his mind. Every time that the brawny ho&s;t left the room, (a cir|cum&s;tance which the Jew attended to with great watchfulne&s;s,) he did not fail to utter the &s;evere&s;t denunciations of vengeance; and, upon the &s;oldier's tell|ing him that it was a great misfortune that he was not born a Chri&s;tian, the Jew replied with heat, "And, pray&s;h,
<PB N="55" REF="53">
my good friend, what better&s;h &s;hould I have been if I&s;h had been born a Chri&s;tian?"&mdash;"Why, you would not retain all this animo&s;ity again&s;t the landlord," &s;ays the &s;oldier, "becau&s;e, if &s;o be, that you're &s;truck on one cheek, it commands you for to turn the other." &mdash;"Oh! it do&s;h, do&s;h it?" rejoins the other, "why, then, give me leave&s;h to tell you, Ma&s;ter Soldier, you Chri&s;|tians don't appear to me, by your practi&s;h, to be mu&s;h the better for your education."&mdash;" Aye, how d'ye make that out, Mo&s;y?" &s;ays the &s;oldier.&mdash; Why, don't they hang the people&s;h from our &s;hinagog in London without mer|chy," replied the pedlar, "and all, &s;o &s;hall Got &s;have me, merely becau&s;e they buy a little plate and jewel&s;h by way of a bargain&s;h."&mdash;"Aye, aye, you mean,
<PB N="56" REF="54">
Mo&s;y," &s;ays the &s;oldier, "becau&s;e they buy &s;tolen goods, and &s;o you complain, d'ye &s;ee, becau&s;e they hang the Jews for being con&s;arn|ed in a robbery; &mdash; why, if it wasn't for that, how would you, for in&s;tance, be able to travel about in &s;afety?"&mdash;"Why, that&s;h very true, upon my &s;oul;&mdash;here&s;h your heal&s;h, my good friend," &s;ays the Jew, drink|ing to the military di&s;putant, whom he regarded now as a miracle of di&s;cern|ment and integrity;&mdash;"by the Got of my fathere&s;h," added he, "if it was not for the happine&s;h of your &s;hochi|ety, I would not &s;tay another hour under the roof of this bloody-minded publican&s;h."</P>
<P>In this jocund manner did the Jew and the &s;oldier pa&s;s their time, in an
<PB N="57" REF="55">
agreeable <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> until one in the morning, by which hour the I&s;raelite's rational faculties were all dormant, or, in other words, he was made complete|ly drunk, having &s;acrificed to Bacchus &s;o powerfully, that all tho&s;e ideas which u&s;ually &s;wam uppermo&s;t in his under|&s;tanding, &s;uch as extortion, deception, malice, and a variety of other pa&s;&s;ions, of the &s;ame amiable complexion, were now totally obliterated from the tablet of his memory, and lay drowned, not in the Lethean lake, &s;o famed by Ovid, yet full as effectually in home-brewed ale. In this bea&s;tly &s;tate of negative exi&s;t|ence did his bo&s;om-friend, the wily de|&s;troyer of gunpowder, drag him to bed, with his feet trailing along the ground, as in&s;en&s;ible of motion as if he had been
<PB N="58" REF="56">
a dead body actually drawn from the field of battle.</P>
<P>After the &s;oldier had properly di&s;po&s;ed of the body of this circumci&s;ed ac|quaintance, he returned for his box of pedlary wares, and, taking it with him under his arm, wi&s;hed us a good night, when we all retired to our &s;everal apart|ments to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Having drunk a much greater quan|tity of liquor than u&s;ual, I was obliged to ri&s;e in the middle of the night, to grope about for a convenience, when I was diverted from my purpo&s;e by a ter|rible outcry of <Q>Thieves! thieves! murder! here's a villain wanting to ravi&s;h me!</Q> When my terrors had a little &s;ub&s;ided, I perceived the land|lord making towards me in his &s;hirt, with a candle in his hand, inquiring
<PB N="59" REF="57">
where the noi&s;e came from; which we quickly a&s;certained by the &s;ame outcries being repeated, and, breaking open the door of the room in which the &s;oldier, his trull, and the Jew, were contained, we &s;aw the former leaning over the bed, in the act of pinioning down the un|fortunate Jew, who lay there half a|wake, muttering Hebrew, which we conceived, by his attitudes and the roll|ing of his eyes, to be prayers, while the trull was exclaiming, <Q>Ah! you vil|lain; what! want to ruin me, you impudent thief, while my dear hu&s;|band was here too, you dog; but, by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Holy, you eternal vagabond, I'll make you know your Lord G&mdash;d from Tom Bell:</Q> at the end of which pious denunciation &s;he laid hold of I&s;aac's beard, and pulled it with
<PB N="60" REF="58">
&s;uch vigour, that, before the mi&s;erable devil could di&s;entangle him&s;elf from her gripe, &s;he had torn a handful of the bri&s;tly ornament of his chin away by the roots.</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner quitted her hold, than her precious helpmate, &s;eizing him by the &s;hirt, in attempting to drag him out of bed, tore it to the bottom; but, failing in that endeavour, he pulled down the bed-clothes, (which I&s;aac held be|tween his remaining teeth as long as he was able,) and, wielding his &s;tick, began to beat the mahogany carca&s;s of the Jew without an idea of compa&s;&s;ion; but I&s;aac, not reli&s;hing that kind of exerci&s;e, leaped out of bed with the celerity of a doe, and, before his a&s;&s;ailant could well turn round, had &s;ecreted him&s;elf in the chimney, where he remained, uttering yells and lamentations more di&s;mal than
<PB N="61" REF="59">
were ever made by Nebuchadnezzar during his re&s;idence in the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>From the knowledge I had of my companion's artifices, and the extraor|dinary methods by which he &s;eemed to eke out a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I had no doubt but that this attempt on the cha&s;tity of his lady, which was imputed to the Jew, was no other than a preconcerted &s;cheme between this amiable pair to bring the I&s;raelite into trouble, and take advan|tage of his con&s;ternation; and, in the &s;equel, I found that my &s;u&s;picions were but too well founded.</P>
<P>Upon the reiterated promi&s;es of the landlord, that his per&s;on &s;hould be un|mole&s;ted, the grief-laden de&s;cendent of Mordecai ventured to leave his un&s;a|voury retreat, and made his appearance, covered and defiled with foot, and trem|bling

<P>After inquiring for his clothes, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner he was able, and, at intervals, was talking to him&s;elf in a language that we could not comprehend, when the landlord taxed him with the crime that was laid to his charge, and was painting the heniou&s;|ne&s;s of the offence, and that the laws of the land would even ju&s;tify the &s;oldier in taking away his life in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion: when the mortified I&s;aac fell upon his knees, and prote&s;ted that he was in|nocent of the crime of having attempt|ed to debauch any man's wife; and, &s;triking his brea&s;t with great emotion, he &s;wore, <Q>Dat i&s;h Cot's truth, &s;o &s;hall Cot &s;ave me, &s;o &s;hall Cot damn me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="61">The Jew, finding him&s;elf environed now with enemies on all &s;ides, deter|mined to get out of the hou&s;e as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;et about it with as much indu&s;try as was ever exerci&s;ed by Uly&s;&s;es, or any of his companions, to make their e&s;cape from the dangerous cave of Po|lyphemus. After &s;crambling for his tat|tered ve&s;tments, the next grand object that engro&s;&s;ed his imagination was the box, which contained all his portable merchandi&s;e, and by the help of which, under the management of an infinite deal of cunning, did he fondly hope to be one day able to &s;it down, ble&s;t with wealth, (gleaned from the uncircumci|&s;ed,) among his brethren of the &s;yna|gogue, who eat and drink, in filth and abomination, agreeable to the law of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="62">But, alas! the hours that he had un|luckily &s;pent in the company of my exemplary fellow-traveller, the &s;oldier, were doomed by fate to be unpropi|tious to poor I&s;aac; and indeed it was prede&s;tined that he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o much, that I ardently wi&s;h the evils that attended him, on that memorable day, may be con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently expiatory for his former mal-practices.</P>
<P>When, after a &s;earch of one hour, he had recovered his box, he opened it with great trepidation and avidity, to &s;ee if every thing was &s;afe, when, lo! to his un&s;peakable mortification, he mi&s;&s;ed full three-fourths of its contents. He had no &s;ooner made the di&s;covery than the roof echoed with his cries and execra|tions; &mdash; <Q>Oh! by the Cot of my fa|there&s;h, but I am robbed of all my

properti&s;h!</Q> cries the mi&s;erable I&s;aac; and, feeling in his pocket at the &s;ame time, he found his pur&s;e had decamped al&s;o; when he added, in heart-rending notes of deep-toned woe,&mdash;<Q>and my moni&s;h! my moni&s;h! &s;o help me Cot, I&s;h lo&s;t my moni&s;h!</Q></P>
<P>During the whole of this tran&s;action, the &s;oldier was employed in telling the landlord that he knew I&s;aac's pranks of old, and that he was &s;ure, in&s;tead of being robbed him&s;elf, as he was com|plaining, that he had actually purloined &s;omething belonging to the publican, and, in order to e&s;cape that and pay|ing his reckoning, he had rai&s;ed this artificial outcry about a lo&s;s which he had never experienced. &mdash; <HI>"Fate</HI> and <HI>trot,</HI>" &s;ays the landlord, "your &s;tory is very likely, and I'm much obliged

to you for the hint; for, though I never had a Jew lodge with me be|fore, by my &s;oul I always heard they were a &s;et of damned rogues."</P>
<P>I&s;aac, &s;till continuing ob&s;tinate to the text he fir&s;t &s;et out upon, and making a terrible outery about his lo&s;&s;es, threat|ened to have the landlord before a ju&s;|tice of the peace in the morning, and, by certain nods, winks, and in&s;inuations, gave us to under&s;tand, that he verily be|lieved he had a hand in the bu&s;ine&s;s; which &s;o nettled the ho&s;t, that he in|&s;tantly collared the terrified I&s;raelite without ceremony, and &s;wore he would &s;earch him in&s;tantly, for he believed, that, in&s;tead of being robbed of the ar|ticles he was making &s;uch a hideous yell about, he had &s;ecreted &s;ome of his pro|perty; and &s;wore, for the &s;lurs he had
<PB N="67" REF="65">
thrown upon his character, that, if he found any thing belonging to him con|cealed about his per&s;on, of the value of tenpence, he would hang him like a dog at the next a&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his other gue&s;ts he threw the Jew upon the floor, and, putting his hand in his coat-pocket, pulled out a tremendous &s;lice of fat pork, in weight, moderately &s;peaking, about five pounds, which the &s;oldier had pre|viou&s;ly conveyed into his pockets, while he was bu&s;tling about his lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon this inconte&s;tible proof of his guilt, the landlord &s;eized the Jew as his pri&s;oner, and, tying his arms behind him with a &s;trong cord, forced him into the cellar, where he remained a clo&s;e cap|tive until the morning, when they took him from his dungeon, to carry him

<P>The &s;tory of the robbery had by this time gained &s;o much ground, that a great number of boys had gathered round the door, waiting, with anxious expectation, for the appearance of the per&s;ecuted I&s;raelite; who was no &s;ooner conducted into the &s;treet than they &s;et up a roar of exultation, and continued to torment the poor wretch with the bittere&s;t &s;arca&s;ms upon his religion and the nature of the theft, as the bacon was carried before him, elevated on a pole, amid&s;t the &s;houts of the &s;urrounding multitude; all which indignities I&s;aac bore in &s;ilence, "with a patient &s;hrug," until they arrived at the magi&s;trate's.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING conceived a mo&s;t in&s;u|perable aver&s;ion to my military companion, in con&s;equence of the vi|ciou&s;ne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, which had been manife&s;ted on &s;o many occa&s;ions in the &s;hort time that I had the honour of his acquaintance, I &s;ecretly rejoiced
<PB N="71" REF="69">
at his retreat, and determined for the future to be more guarded and circum|&s;pect in the choice of my a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>Being now within a few miles of the capital, I &s;et forward with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, in order to reach it before the evening, which I &s;hould have found a difficulty in effecting, if I had not rode upon a car, that was carrying corn to the Dublin market, for at lea&s;t &s;ix miles of the road.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t entered the city, every thing around me &s;truck me with amaze|ment. Having been u&s;ed, from my infancy, to &s;ee the &s;ocieties of mankind compri&s;ed within the narrow compa&s;s of a country town, I had no idea of all that bu&s;tle, noi&s;e, and confu&s;ion, which characteri&s;es the metropolis of a com|mercial kingdom; &mdash; the &s;treets, car|riages,
<PB N="72" REF="70">
and public buildings, appeared like &s;o many objects rai&s;ed by the power of enchantment.</P>
<P>I had &s;trolled through &s;everal &s;treets, totally ignorant of the be&s;t method to pur&s;ue, and wrapt up in contemplation and wonder, when the wind in my bowels and the gnawing in my &s;tomach put me in mind that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould eat; and this &s;ug|ge&s;tion called forth a hundred others, equally di&s;agreeable; for the reader will recollect, that I had before lo&s;t every farthing I was worth in the wide world.</P>
<P>I remained for &s;ome minutes ab&s;orbed in reflexion, when, not knowing whither to direct my weary &s;teps in &s;earch of either a meal to eat or a lodging to &s;leep in, I bur&s;t into a flood of tears,
<PB N="73" REF="71">
and was actually &s;tanding in the middle of the &s;treet a public &s;pectacle of want and wretchedne&s;s, when I received a familiar &s;lap upon the &s;houlder, accom|panied with <Q>Damn ye, Jack, what do you &s;nivel for, you dog?</Q> Upon my turning round, I perceived a gen|tleman, about thirty years of age, with a good-humoured countenance, well dre&s;&s;ed, an oak &s;apling under his arm, and a cockade in his hat. He inquired into the cau&s;e of my &s;orrow with a de|gree of attention and curio&s;ity, that &s;uf|ficiently a&s;&s;ured me his heart was in|fluenced by the &s;oft dictates of huma|nity, though his language and his man|ners &s;avoured &s;omewhat of roughne&s;s.</P>
<P>When he was acquainted with the particulars of my life, he told me that I had been obliged to weather &s;ome hard
<PB N="74" REF="72">
gales, to be &s;ure, con&s;idering I was lit|tle better than a cock-boat at pre&s;ent, and not much balla&s;t on-board;&mdash;"but what of that, my lad," &s;ays the ge|nerous &s;tranger; "who knows but you may be the better for it as long as you live? &mdash; come, give me your hand; &mdash; if you have a mind to live with me, d'ye &s;ee, as my &s;ervant, why, you &s;hall be welcome, and en|ter into pre&s;ent pay and good quar|ters: &mdash; what d'ye &s;ay, you dog?"&mdash; is it a match?"</P>
<P>I thanked him for his friend&s;hip, and told him, if he plea&s;ed, that I would fol|low him throughout the wide world; and indeed, at the in&s;tant I &s;poke, my heart accorded perfectly with my profe&s;&s;ions, as I was much attached to his intere&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="73">
from the open and &s;incere manner in which he acco&s;ted me.</P>
<P>After following my new ma&s;ter for near a mile, we &s;topped at a genteel hou&s;e, in the neighbourhood of College-green, which I &s;oon found was his place of re&s;idence, when he informed his landlady that he had hired me as his &s;ervant; at the &s;ame time ordering me to get my &s;upper and go to bed, as he had no doubt but I was greatly fatigued; and that he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for me early in the morning. Indeed, there required but little pre&s;&s;ing, on his part, to oblige me to execute &s;o agreeable an order, for, what with fa&s;ting and exer|ci&s;e, my guts were actually in a &s;tate of open rebellion: however, the next morning I entered upon my new &s;tate of &s;ervitude, and felt the mo&s;t eager
<PB N="76" REF="74">
de&s;ire for my ma&s;ter's ri&s;ing, under who&s;e banners I propo&s;ed living, for the future, with the utmo&s;t degree of ea&s;e and tranquillity.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants of the hou&s;e, with whom I had &s;upped the preceding even|ing, gave him the mo&s;t amiable cha|racter imaginable, and I learnt from them that the name of my benefactor was O'Dri&s;col, and lieutenant of a man of war, who had obtained leave of his cap|tain, who then lay at Port&s;mouth, to pay a vi&s;it to his relations in Ireland. They farther informed me, that I might expect to be very comfortable in my new &s;ituation, as Mr. O'Dri&s;col po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed every virtue under heaven but one, which was oeconomy; to which nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in the human com|po&s;ition he was &s;o utter a &s;tranger, that
<PB N="77" REF="75">
he very frequently &s;upplied the wants of the nece&s;&s;itous and importunate, and left him&s;elf without a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>It was near eleven before I was &s;um|moned by the bell to prepare my ma&s;ter's breakfa&s;t, which I under&s;tood, from the &s;ervants of the family, was generally cold beef and grog, which is a beverage pe|culiarly palatable to &s;eamen, made of rum, water, and &s;ugar. When I enter|ed my ma&s;ter's chamber, he acco&s;ted me with, <Q>Well, Tony, you dog, how did you &s;leep?&mdash;was the hammock convenient?&mdash;but I &s;uppo&s;e as how, that, what with travelling, and the cargo of fre&s;h provi&s;ions you &s;towed in your hold la&s;t night, you'd have &s;lept at the main top-ma&s;t head of a man of war in the Bay of Bi&s;cay:&mdash; but, come, have they told you what
<PB N="78" REF="76">
&s;ort of a breakfa&s;t I eat?</Q>&mdash;When I an&s;wered in the affirmative, and in|formed him that I had laid it for him in the dining-room, he &s;allied out in his night-gown and &s;lippers, and, &s;it|ting down at the table, attacked the beef and bread with the appetite of an alderman. After he had demoli&s;hed about two pounds of &s;olid beef, and drunk a quart of grog, he ordered me to take away the things, and get my own breakfa&s;t. &mdash; <Q>I hope you don't want tea,</Q> &s;ays my ma&s;ter.&mdash;I a&s;&s;u|red him that I &s;hould always think my|&s;elf extremely happy with a piece of beef and bread for my breakfa&s;t. &mdash; "Aye, you dog, that's right," &s;ays the lieutenant, "I turned off my &s;er|vant a day or two ago, becau&s;e he could not do without tea, and be
<PB N="79" REF="77">
damned to him;&mdash;for my part, Tony, I dete&s;t tea; I think it a weed that has already done a damned deal of mi&s;chief to old England, and I believe, in my heart, can never po&s;&s;ibly do any good either to the body politic or na|tural."</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter was proceeding in vehe|ment exclamations again&s;t the perni|cious tendency of tea, when his di&s;|cour&s;e was interrupted by the arrival of a brother-officer. After the mutual exchange of a few &s;alutations, which appeared much higher tinctured with &s;in|cerity than refinement, he dre&s;&s;ed; and, giving me a few general orders, the&s;e &s;ons of Neptune went forth arm in arm.</P>
<P>I had now lei&s;ure to reflect upon the comforts that I enjoyed in my new em|ployment, which, contra&s;ting with my
<PB N="80" REF="78">
former &s;ituation with Calomel, and the &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;eries I had experienced, made me as completely ble&s;t in imagi|nation as I believe it po&s;&s;ible for a hu|man creature to be.</P>
<P>At length the hour arrived that it was u&s;ual for my ma&s;ter to come home to dinner, when, not &s;eeing him, it was conjectured by the family that he had met with &s;ome engagement accidental|ly, which had prevented him: however, the evening came, and we heard no|thing of the lieutenant, which created &s;ome alarms upon his account in the brea&s;ts of all the people of the hou&s;e, to whom he had particularly endeared him&s;elf by the goodne&s;s of his heart and the affability of his manners.</P>
<P>At la&s;t night approached, and yet we heard no tidings of my ma&s;ter. Now
<PB N="81" REF="79">
every one appeared intere&s;ted for his welfare. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, knowing the warmth of his di&s;po&s;ition, entertained an idea that he might have got into &s;ome ugly affray, which had ended in a duel, and he, perhaps, <Q>poor, &s;weet, gentleman,</Q> (as &s;he phra&s;ed it,) had lo&s;t his life.</P>
<P>But our fears, on that &s;core, all &s;ub|&s;ided about eleven o'clock, when a man with a &s;tern and forbidding a&s;pect knock|ed at the door, and a&s;ked for Lieutenant O'Dri&s;col's &s;ervant; at the &s;ame time informing the family that my ma&s;ter was arre&s;ted for a bond of two hundred pounds, and now lay in confinement at a &s;punging-hou&s;e in Thomas-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The horror which I felt, and indeed every per&s;on in the hou&s;e, on hearing the above intelligence, may be more
<PB N="82" REF="80">
ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed; how|ever, recollecting the orders of my ma&s;ter, I followed the grim-looking conductor to the officer's hou&s;e who had arre&s;ted him.</P>
<P>When I came to that dreary abode of mi&s;ery, I pa&s;&s;ed through two doors, covered over with plates of iron, the keys of which were kept by a tall, raw|boned, man, who&s;e countenance was &s;o terrific, in my idea, that I trembled with apprehen&s;ion as I pa&s;&s;ed by him to my ma&s;ter, whom I found in a &s;mall, filthy, room, &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide, leaning upon a grea&s;y oak table, with his head reclined upon his hand, and di&s;cour&s;ing with an ill-looking fellow, who &s;at op|po&s;ite, (whom I afterwards found to be the bailiff him&s;elf,) with the mo&s;t per|fect compo&s;ure and familiarity.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="81">When I entered the room, the lieu|tenant ordered me to &s;it down; and, calling for pen, ink, and paper, he wrote a letter, which having &s;ealed up, he privately informed me of the place where the per&s;on lived to whom he had directed it; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring the officer, that his friend would &s;atisfy him for the debt the in&s;tant he &s;hould arrive; to which this human harpy replied, <Q>I am very glad to hear it, ma&s;ter; for why, now, &s;hould I wi&s;h to keep a good-natured gentleman, as you &s;eem to be, d'ye &s;ee, locked up here?&mdash;to be &s;ure I get a trifle by the wine, but what &s;ignifies all that?&mdash;But I per|ceive, as how, that our bottle's out;&mdash; here, you Bet!</Q> cries the bailiff;&mdash; upon which the fellow who had con|ducted
<PB N="84" REF="82">
me to the hou&s;e told his em|ployer, that his wife was below &s;tairs, cooking the gentleman's &s;upper. &mdash; <Q>Here, then," &s;ays the ferocious chief, take this here bottle down to the bitch, and tell her to &s;end another full of claret;&mdash;bid her to &s;end the right &s;ort;&mdash;d'ye hear, Peter?&mdash;you under&s;tand me,</Q> &s;ays the bailiff; at the &s;ame time tipping his under&s;trapper a wink.&mdash;"Aye, aye," &s;ays the other, and in&s;tantly di&s;appeared; when the bailiff, re&s;uming the thread of his con|ver&s;ation, proceeded,&mdash;<Q>As I was &s;ay|ing, ma&s;ter, &s;uppo&s;e I do get a trifle by the wine, it's all nothing, d'ye &s;ee me, becau&s;e why, the taxes eat us up.</Q> &mdash; Here his elegant apology was interrupted; for, by this time, my ma&s;ter, having &s;ealed and directed the
<PB N="85" REF="83">
letter, gave me po&s;itive orders to de|liver it into none but the gentleman's own hands, and to return to him with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te.</P>
<P>When I read the &s;uper&s;cription, I found it directed to a Captain Pennant, who lived at one of the quays, leading down to the water-&s;ide. I literally o|beyed my ma&s;ter's injunctions, and, by good luck, got a man to &s;hew me to the captain's hou&s;e. I knocked at the door, and inquired if &s;uch a per&s;on lodged there, and if he was at home; upon which I was &s;hewed up &s;tairs, and found the lieutenant's friend, with five or &s;ix more gentlemen of the navy, &s;acrificing warmly to Bacchus, and drowning the &s;orrows of the day in a capacious bowl of rum-punch.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="84">When I had delivered my letter, which the captain read with &s;igns of evident emotion, he &s;hewed it to his companions, who, upon peru&s;ing it, &s;tarted from their &s;eats, and propo&s;ed an in&s;tantaneous vi&s;it to my ma&s;ter, but, being oppo&s;ed in this project by the interpo&s;ition of their chief, they de&s;i&s;t|ed; the captain at the &s;ame time order|ing me to go back to the lieutenant immediately, and inform him that he would follow me with a wet &s;ail, and procure his relea&s;e, in le&s;s than an hour.</P>
<P>As I conceived the&s;e to be the ti|dings of joy, I hurried back to the &s;punging-hou&s;e as fa&s;t as my legs could carry me, and informed my ma&s;ter of the i&s;&s;ue of my errand; upon which he ordered more wine, and treated the bailiff and his people with as much as
<PB N="87" REF="85">
they could drink, till at la&s;t the prin|cipal him&s;elf fell a&s;leep in his chair, and the re&s;t of his infernal group began to reel under the influence of the purple god.</P>
<P>I had not returned above half an hour, when we heard a bu&s;tle at the outer door, which increa&s;ed to that violence at la&s;t as rou&s;ed the attention of the bailiff, who had by this time fallen a&s;leep. Pre&s;ently in ru&s;hes Captain Pennant, fol|lowed by &s;even or eight &s;tout &s;eamen, who in&s;tantly &s;ecured the grim member of the law and two of his people. The third, who &s;tood centinel at the door, fore&s;eeing the nature of the captain's vi&s;it, (who was no other than the commander of a pre&s;s-gang, at that time &s;tationed in Dublin, for the purpo&s;e of procuring recruits to man the navy,) flew up &s;tairs, followed
<PB N="88" REF="86">
by two &s;ailors, who touched the &s;kirt of his coat ju&s;t as he got out upon the leads of the hou&s;e; and, in endeavour|ing to leap over to the top of the oppo|&s;ite man&s;ion, he made a fal&s;e &s;tep, and fell down from an eminence, four &s;tory high, into a blind alley, which &s;eparated the two hou&s;es, and, pitching plump upon his head, fractured his &s;cull, and died upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>As for the bailiff and his followers, the &s;ailors, after &s;tripping and tying them together, forced them into a hack|ney-coach, which happened to be pa&s;&s;|ing by; and, making the coachman get up behind, the &s;ailors mounted on the box and roof, and drove the carriage down to the water-&s;ide, where a boat was waiting, into which they forced the unfortunate bailiff and his adherents, and

<P>A &s;ailor having been di&s;patched from the captain of the packet, to inform us that the ve&s;&s;el would fall down the river on the turn of tide, which would happen in half an hour, we were obliged to manage our affairs accordingly; the lieutenant, to avoid the po&s;&s;ibility of being known, having previou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a &s;uit of womens apparel, which the captain had got from his land|lady for the purpo&s;e.&mdash;A coach being called to the door, in &s;tepped my ma&s;|ter, the captain, and another gentle|man, with a large cargo of &s;ea &s;tores, con&s;i&s;ting of a cold boiled ham, a pair of fowls, bread, brandy, and claret.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the place of our de&s;tination, at George's quay, and were
<PB N="93" REF="91">
putting our provi&s;ions in the boat, I felt the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing regret at the idea of leaving my native land, perhaps for ever, and though not quite &s;ixteen years of age, &s;o forcibly did the idea di&s;tre&s;s me, and &s;o much did the love of my country cling about my heart, that I actually wept with my di&s;tre&s;s; but, turning my head round to look at the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers, and ob&s;erving that they all appeared in a &s;tate of per|fect indifference as to that event, I thought the amiable emotions of pa|trioti&s;m were unmanly, and &s;ecretly wi|ped away the tears that bedewed my cheeks, unnoticed by my ma&s;ter or the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>After indulging a &s;ilent reverie for a few minutes, my curio&s;ity was thorough|ly rou&s;ed by the novelty of the objects
<PB N="94" REF="92">
that &s;urrounded me, and the plea&s;ures of my &s;ight had completely di&s;&s;ipated the anxieties of thought. I now, for the fir&s;t time in my life, found my&s;elf &s;ailing on the bo&s;om of the water, &s;urrounded by a number of per&s;ons of all ages, condi|tions, and de&s;criptions. The boat which we were in appeared to me ready to &s;ink with the weight of its burden; and, when I inquired of one of the &s;ailors how far we were to proceed in that man|ner, and under&s;tood that the packet lay at the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t a league from the place of our embarkation, I felt a cold &s;weat on all my limbs, and, not|with&s;tanding the force of my curio&s;ity, I could not help wi&s;hing my&s;elf back a hundred times; however, after a &s;afe and agreeable &s;ail, of about half an hour, down the Liffey, with the waters
<PB N="95" REF="93">
beautifully illumined by the &s;etting &s;un, the &s;heds of Clontarf forming a charming back ground at a di&s;tance, and the horizon bounded by the purple maje&s;ty of the hill of Howth, we arrived at the &s;ide of the packet as the &s;ailors on-board were bu&s;y in unbending the &s;ails, preparatory to our voyage.</P>
<P>As the pa&s;&s;engers ro&s;e from their &s;eats, in order to embark on-board the ve&s;&s;el, I had a fair opportunity of &s;urveying their per&s;ons. The number in the boat was nearly fifty, out of which I could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h about one-third to be cabin-pa&s;&s;engers. The re&s;t were mo&s;tly Iri&s;h haymakers, or, what in that coun|try are called, <HI>&s;palpeens,</HI> who were going over to England to perform the drudge|ries of agriculture, and be ready again&s;t the en&s;uing harve&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="94">When the captain had got them all on-board, he made them immediately de&s;cend, one by one, into the hold, or bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, where I under&s;tood they were to remain until the packet ar|rived at Liverpool, in company with four hor&s;es and a brood-mare, which were &s;lung in the center, as their a&s;&s;o|ciates. When they had all de&s;cended to their wooden couch, the mate of the packet fa&s;tened down the hatch-way, and left them to &s;hift for a bed below as well as they were able.</P>
<P>The company in the cabin con&s;i&s;ted now of &s;eventeen per&s;ons, among whom was a celebrated comedian, returning from his theatrical engagements in Dub|lin; a Methodi&s;t preacher, who had been propagating the Go&s;pel in Ireland, a|greeable to the doctrine of John We&s;ley; a Liverpool attorney; a Scotch phy&s;i|cian;
<PB N="97" REF="95">
an officer of hor&s;e; a young Con|naught noviciate, who was going to &s;tudy divinity in the Iri&s;h college at Paris; a Quaker from Waterford, with his wife; a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer; a fi&s;h|woman from George's-quay; a young gentleman, going out as a cadet in the Ea&s;t-India Company's &s;ervice; with a pawnbroker's widow and her two daughters; my ma&s;ter habited as a young lady, with a black bonnet and cloak; and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After a va&s;t deal of altercation about priority, in regard to the beds in the cabin, it was at la&s;t &s;ettled that the la|dies &s;hould have the preference, and the men &s;hift for them&s;elves; a determi|nation that &s;eemed perfectly agreeable to all the company except the exci&s;e-man, who, grumbling at the deci&s;ion,
<PB N="98" REF="96">
ob&s;erved, that it was but ju&s;t, as they all paid equally for their accommoda|tion, that they &s;hould all fare alike.&mdash; He was proceeding in his remark with great bitterne&s;s, when the officer, ap|proaching him with a &s;tern brow, told him, that the ladies had done him the honour to put them&s;elves under his protection, and, upon the &s;trength of &s;uch authority, he reque&s;ted them to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e beds which were mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>At this laconic intimation, the ex|ci&s;e-man thought proper to drop the &s;ubject; and, &s;kulking into a corner by him&s;elf, the ladies proceeded to fix upon their place of repo&s;e, which was an in|ner room, detached from the cabin by a gla&s;s door, into which they all enter|ed, my ma&s;ter included, and, getting
<PB N="99" REF="97">
into their &s;everal beds, prepared them|&s;elves, in the be&s;t manner they were able, to encounter that dreadful &s;ick|ne&s;s, which a certain qualmi&s;hne&s;s in their &s;tomachs informed them was very rapidly approaching.&mdash;As for the re&s;t of the tenants of the cabin, they be|took them&s;elves to their &s;everal quarters with the utmo&s;t alacrity; and happy was he who could &s;cud the fa&s;te&s;t; for, ha|ving weighed anchor, and the ve&s;&s;el being under way, &s;he began to roll in the waves from one &s;ide to the other, to the great annoyance of the &s;quami&s;h &s;ons of fre&s;h water, with which the ve&s;|&s;el was crouded.</P>
<P>Night began to &s;pread her &s;able man|tle over one half of this habitable globe, when the captain, coming into the ca|bin, told his pa&s;&s;engers that we had
<PB N="100" REF="98">
cleared the light-hou&s;e, at the entrance of the harbour, and were now going right before the wind in the bay, with as fine a gale as heart could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce made this declara|tion, when, in tacking about, the &s;hip gave a terrible plunge, which &s;o alarmed the Methodi&s;t, that, putting his head out of his birth, he a&s;ked the captain if he was &s;ure we were all &s;afe; if not, he begged him, for the love of God, to tell him, that he might have time to &s;ay his prayers, and intercede with the Almighty for the precious &s;ouls of the children of &s;in on-board, who had never known the comforts of the new birth.&mdash;"Oh! never mind trifles," re|plies the tarpawling, "I'll be damned but you're as &s;afe here as in your own bed."&mdash;"Oh! don't &s;wear, you mon|&s;ter

of impiety," cries the preacher, when &s;uch wickedne&s;s, and profana|tion, is on-board, I &s;hould not marvel if we all went to the bottom."</P>
<P>He had &s;carce uttered the la&s;t &s;ylla|ble, when the fi&s;h-woman, who &s;lept in the inner apartment, opened the door with her hand, and put out her head, which, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a dirty woollen night-cap, appeared as unamiable and hideous as the &s;ign of the Saracen's, being covered with car|buncles all over, which made her look at a di&s;tance &s;omewhat like a fiery meteor, or blazing countenance, with a pair of &s;mall grey eyes, that &s;hone with unu|&s;ual fury upon this occa&s;ion; &mdash; when this fi&s;h-dealing amazon had opened the door, &s;he acco&s;ted the captain of the packet in the following eloquent ad|monition:
<PB N="102" REF="100">
&mdash;"Here's a pretty rig, bla&s;t my limbs, that I am to pay my good-looking guinea for &s;leeping here, and be di&s;turbed by that canting, lou&s;y, mu&s;t-be-damned, &s;coundrel."&mdash;"Out upon thee, thou vile daughter of Sa|tan," cries the Methodi&s;t. &mdash; "Out upon me, indeed!" cries the other, out upon your&s;elf, you dirty, coward|ly, &s;nivelling, hypocritical, ra&s;cal."&mdash; I defy thee, thou ungodly woman," replies the preacher, "and, if you don't turn a&s;ide from the path of abomina|tions, you will become as polluted as the whore of Babylon."</P>
<P>At the mention of the word <HI>whore,</HI> the fi&s;hmonger's lady, lo&s;ing all pa|tience, leaped from her bed with the agility of a greyhound, and, flying a|cro&s;s the cabin, would have left the

poor Methodi&s;t no rea&s;on to pride him|&s;elf upon his admonitions, had not the captain, apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;e|quences, interpo&s;ed, and a&s;&s;ured her, that he was certain the gentleman in black did not mean to offend her. &mdash; "How dare he call me <HI>whore</HI> then?" replies the enraged female, "I, to who&s;e character no one dares &s;ay, black is the white of my eye." &mdash; "I did not mean to call you whore," &s;ays the other.&mdash;"Who did you call whore then?" &s;ays the oi&s;ter-vender. &mdash; "Why, the pope of Rome," cries the Metho|di&s;t, he is the great &s;carlet whore of iniquity, that, like a bottomle&s;s gulf, &s;walloweth up the blind and the un|wary."&mdash;"And how dare &s;uch a fel|low as you treat his holine&s;s with ir|reverence?" cries the young novi|ciate,

<P>This la&s;t acrimonious remark ope|rated upon the mind of the Methodi&s;t like a &s;park of fire upon a train of gun-powder, for, in his religious opinions, he was inflexible as adamant, and would indeed have con&s;idered him&s;elf as a ble&s;&s;ed martyr to the faith that he pro|fe&s;&s;ed, had he died in the act of deny|ing the pope's &s;upremacy. Strengthen|ed with this enthu&s;ia&s;m, he in&s;tantly turned about to an&s;wer the young cham|pion of his holine&s;s, who lay in a com|partment

immediately above him, there being three, one over the other, erected on each &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, to contain beds for the accommodation of the pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the preacher had turned him&s;elf round, he began to inveigh mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t the encroachments of popery on the liberties of mankind, and was actually proceeding, with all the vehemence he was able, to &s;candali&s;e the infallible father and his followers, when the exci&s;e-man, who &s;lept in the upper tier of beds, being &s;eized with a &s;udden fit of &s;ickne&s;s, and, to avoid bemiring his own ne&s;t with the nau&s;eous contents of his &s;tomach, pops his head over the &s;ide of the cabin, and in&s;tantly di&s;charged, on the mo&s;t moderate cal|culation, at lea&s;t a quart of foetid li|quids

plump into the face of the angry Methodi&s;t, who lay upon his back, with his mouth wide open, railing, with all the fury of a bigot, again&s;t the young prie&s;t <HI>in petto,</HI> who had offended him, and was collecting all the force of his lungs to give a &s;trong empha&s;is to the words <HI>&s;carlet whore,</HI> which he had re|peated before with uncommon energy, when the exci&s;e-man unluckily di&s;em|boguing at that in&s;tant, the greate&s;t part of the &s;olid matter falling into the &s;aint's mouth, made the be&s;t of its way down his throat, and, fairly choking up all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;peech, left the mi&s;e|rable di&s;ciple of John We&s;ley an object of pity and abhorrence.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome minutes before he could make his ca&s;e known to the cabin-boy, who lay &s;leeping before the fire, which
<PB N="107" REF="105">
when he had effected at la&s;t with infinite difficulty, the young retainer of Nep|tune, with great compo&s;ure, lighted a candle, and, &s;eeing the forlorn &s;tate of the itinerant &s;on of regeneration, in|&s;tantly went upon deck, and, in the twinkling of an eye, brought down a mop and a bucket of &s;alt water. With the former he rubbed off the filth from the face of the unhappy wight, and com|pleted the act of purification by da&s;hing the latter into his face, without either moderation or mercy; but, not per|forming the la&s;t operation with all that adroitne&s;s and dexterity which it un|doubtedly required, a great part of the briny application running down his bo|&s;om into the bed, left him as fairly de|luged in &s;alt water as if the &s;hip had &s;unk to the bottom of the Channel.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="106">As &s;oon as he had recovered the u&s;e of the organs of &s;peech, he &s;et up a dreadful yell, that made the cabin ring, which the major part of the pa&s;&s;engers taking for a &s;ignal that the packet had met with &s;ome accident, and was foun|dering at &s;ea, leaped from their beds, half dead with fear and horror, and ran after one another upon deck, like &s;o many &s;heep through a broken fence, to &s;ee their danger, and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;wim for their lives. The man at the helm, a&s;toni&s;hed at the unu&s;ual appearance of &s;o many per&s;ons upon deck in their &s;hirts, in the middle of the night, took them for apparitions, and was &s;o appalled with fear, that, quitting his rudder, he made the be&s;t of his way up the &s;hrouds, and left the ve&s;&s;el to the mercy of the waves, till the captain, who was &s;leeping in the

&s;teerage, hearing of the accident and outcry, ran up, and, finding the helm de&s;erted, was almo&s;t frantic with mad|ne&s;s, and proceeded to utter a volley of dreadful oaths; which the preacher no &s;ooner heard than he began to admoni&s;h him for his wickedne&s;s, and, though half dead him&s;elf with cold, he could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o favourable an opportunity of reclaiming a &s;inner, and bringing him once more into the paths of peace. For this pious purpo&s;e he had mounted upon the hatch-way of the ve&s;&s;el, and began to exhort the ferocious com|mander to think of the perils of his &s;i|tuation, and not ri&s;k the &s;alvation of his precious &s;oul, in &s;uch an hour of danger, by expre&s;&s;ions that were fraught with &s;in and unholine&s;s; and, lifting up his hands, with great fervency, he

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as the general con&s;ternation had a little &s;ub&s;ided, and the com|pany had congratulated each other upon their &s;uppo&s;ed e&s;cape from imminent death, a general inquiry was made as to the fate of the poor apo&s;tle, when, lo! he was brought down to his birth in the cabin in &s;uch a lamentable &s;tate, that it
<PB N="113" REF="111">
was the general opinion of the pa&s;&s;en|gers that a final &s;top was put to his ar|duous labours in future, and that his religious peregrinations, in this world, would be no more; however, he was put to bed, with infinite caution, where he &s;oon fell a&s;leep, and convinced us, by the inelegant tones of his &s;noring, that he determined to remain among us &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>The different parties were now court|ing a little re&s;t, and endeavouring to compo&s;e them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, when the demon of di&s;cord, determined that our pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be attended with little el&s;e than broils and battles, thought proper, once more, to throw his flaming brands into the bo&s;om of our &s;ociety; for, ju&s;t as the different organs of the company were put in tune by the &s;omni|fic

hand of Morpheus, and playing a great variety of cadences in treble, te|nor, and ba&s;s, a noi&s;e i&s;&s;ued from the interior cabin, particularly appropriated to the u&s;e of the ladies, that di&s;compo|&s;ed the na&s;onic band, and in&s;tantly broke a&s;under all the delicate ties of harmony. Though we could not ex|actly di&s;tingui&s;h the immediate cau&s;e of the di&s;pute, the words <HI>&s;hocking, indecent,</HI> and <HI>abominable,</HI> were ea&s;ily to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed, as they &s;eemed to be deli|vered with great heat and anger.</P>
<P>Upon the captain's making his ap|pearance, and inquiring into the nature of the di&s;turbance, we found the cau&s;e to be exactly thus.&mdash;The pawnbroker's widow, who a&s;&s;umed an uncommon &s;hare of delicacy, in the whole tenor of her behaviour, &s;ince &s;he came on &s;hip-board,
<PB N="115" REF="113">
was &s;ituated, it &s;eems, in the inner apartment, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to my ma&s;ter, who, pa&s;&s;ing for a woman, in con&s;equence of his apparel, was &s;tation|ed among them; a place which he more eagerly embraced, thinking, that, in &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e, and in &s;o retired a &s;itu|ation, he &s;hould run no po&s;&s;ible ri&s;k of being di&s;covered. However, fate &s;o contrived it that it happened otherwi&s;e; for the calls of nature, in &s;ome parti|culars irre&s;i&s;tible, forced my poor ma&s;ter to get out of his birth, to perform cer|tain rites, which it is wholly impo&s;&s;ible can be done by proxy: and it was in one of the&s;e critical &s;ituations that the delicate lady above-mentioned happened to e&s;py my ma&s;ter; and &s;he was no &s;oon|er convinced of the certainty of his be|ing a man, by perhaps a too curious
<PB N="116" REF="114">
ob&s;ervation on her part, than &s;he imme|diately began to reprobate his a&s;&s;urance, as &s;he called it, in terms of the bittere&s;t malignancy; in which &s;he was pre&s;ent|ly joined by the re&s;t of the females, who declared, one and all, that they would never &s;et foot on-board the packet a|gain.</P>
<P>At this moment the captain entered, and endeavoured to pacify them as well as he was able; and prevailed upon the lieutenant, after &s;ome entreaties, to give up his birth, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|&s;tored tranquillity among us.</P>
<P>Upon the entrance of my ma&s;ter into our cabin in di&s;gui&s;e, it gave ri&s;e to a thou&s;and jokes, which were circulated, with great freedom, at the expence of the lady who had cau&s;ed all this com|motion.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="115">The good humour, that &s;eemed to prevail among three or four of the mo&s;t convivial of the pa&s;&s;engers, induced them to a propo&s;al of immediately get|ting up, and, by clubbing their &s;ea-&s;tores, to make a party at eating and drinking, in order to amu&s;e the time until a pro&s;perous gale &s;hould drive them to the Briti&s;h &s;hore.&mdash;The lieute|nant &s;ang, the comedian repeated a va|riety of &s;peeches from our mo&s;t cele|brated plays, to the manife&s;t diver&s;ion of the company; the phy&s;ician favoured us with a di&s;cour&s;e on the <HI>materia me|dica;</HI> and the attorney informed us of a great cau&s;e he had obtained in Ireland for the widow of a marine officer, who&s;e hu&s;band was &s;hot in the act of fighting for his country, on-board a king's &s;hip, in the Mediterranean; at the &s;ame time
<PB N="118" REF="116">
a&s;&s;uring us, that the only motive he had for pro&s;ecuting the matter was a de&s;ire to have ju&s;tice done to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; which la&s;t in&s;inuation rou&s;ed the atten|tion of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer, who &s;wore, if that really was the ca&s;e, the attorney mu&s;t have altered his practice mo&s;t cur&s;edly, for that, to his certain knowledge, there was not a practitioner in the kingdom who had a keener eye to the profits of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This &s;arca&s;tic remark of the exci&s;e-man &s;eemed to call forth all the natural choler of the attorney, who retorted the charge with intere&s;t, and told him, he &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e he had been conti|nually robbing the king, his ma&s;ter, of his dues, and plundering his &s;ubjects, he imagined every other profe&s;&s;ion was equally infamous and di&s;honourable.&mdash;
<PB N="119" REF="117">
There was a &s;pirit of rancour and truth in this la&s;t ob&s;ervation, which worked upon the feelings of the exci&s;e-man &s;o far as to induce him to lift up a &s;tool, that &s;tood near him, to cha&s;ti&s;e the ag|gre&s;&s;or, which, had the meditated blow taken place, would, in all human pro|bability, have deprived the law of one of its noble members; but he, quickly perceiving the ho&s;tile intentions of the a&s;&s;ailant, crept under the table, to avoid the impending &s;torm, with the agility of a monkey, and remained there till the fury of the exci&s;e-man was appea&s;ed by the attorney's apology, which he made, without he&s;itation, in terms of the mo&s;t abject humiliation.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this in&s;tant the cabin-boy came down among us, and exclaimed, with great exultation, "land! land!" upon
<PB N="120" REF="118">
which the fi&s;h-woman, thru&s;ting her head out of her birth, roared out, <Q>Oh! for God's &s;ake, don't talk to me of land, but bring me the pot!</Q> upon which the boy, who&s;e duty it was to admini&s;ter that nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;il, whenever the pa|tients could not do it for them&s;elves, made ha&s;te to accommodate the fi&s;h-&s;elling nymph, who, not thinking he had hurried him&s;elf &s;o fa&s;t in her &s;ervice as he ought, was attempting to &s;cold him in her own language, and had ac|tually got out the fir&s;t &s;yllable of the laconic word <HI>&s;coundrel,</HI> when her &s;ick|ne&s;s overpowered her eloquence, and &s;he fairly deluged the young ma&s;ter of the ceremonies with the foul contents of her overloaded &s;tomach.</P>
<P>When the poor boy, who had fallen down under the weight of the &s;alute,

<P>By this time the Methodi&s;t, who&s;e &s;ituation had become extremely irk&s;ome to him, got up and joined the company, who had met round the table, in hopes, by li&s;tening to the &s;pirit of their lively conver&s;ation, to forget his own di&s;grace.

that he &s;hould &s;it at the head of the ta|ble, and give the company a &s;ermon for the good of their &s;ouls.

<P>They had &s;carcely fixed the wandering &s;aint in his new &s;ituation, when his

<P>During the time that was &s;pent in per&s;uading the preacher to take off his gla&s;s, the attorney, who &s;at at his right hand, contrived to &s;ub&s;titute a large gla&s;s of brandy, in&s;tead of that which had been appropriated to his &s;hare, which the poor itinerant &s;wallowed com|pletely before he found out his mi&s;take; but he had no &s;ooner lodged it in the rece&s;&s;es of his &s;tomach than he made many wry faces, and complained bitter|ly of the impo&s;ition.

&s;acrificed to Bacchus with the zeal of true votaries, had become half-&s;eas-over; and, &s;o far were they from being di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to his complaints, that they ab|&s;olutely compelled him to drink gla&s;s for gla&s;s, with this difference, that, while they were quaffing weak punch, the Me|thodi&s;t's gla&s;s was continually &s;trength|ened by a large infu&s;ion of &s;trong &s;pirits, which the con&s;cientious attorney kept by him for that excellent purpo&s;e, till the blinking of the preacher's eyes &s;uffi|ciently informed the joyous circle that they had over&s;et his under&s;tanding, or, in other words, had fairly done his bu|&s;ine&s;s; nay, &s;o much had the liquor thrown the good man off his guard, that he actually propo&s;ed to &s;ing a &s;ong, which being greedily acceded to by the company, he gave them a ditty, which

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The packet arrives at Liverpool.&mdash;Take a place in the &s;tage for London.&mdash;De|&s;cription of our fellow-travellers.&mdash;An accident that happened on the road.&mdash; We &s;top at Coventry and quit the &s;tage. &mdash; Meet a &s;ailor on his journey from Plymouth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we arrived in the harbour of Liverpool, my ma&s;ter made what ha&s;te he could on-&s;hore, giving me orders to follow him to the inn with his baggage. It was late in the evening when we di&s;embarked, and I was pre|paring to make the mo&s;t ha&s;te I could to obey the lieutenant's in&s;tructions, and thank my &s;tars that had once more
<PB N="128" REF="126">
brought me on <HI>terra firma,</HI> when a rude fellow &s;aluted me with great incivility, and demanded to know where I was go|ing with my trunk. I in&s;tantly told him, if he had a mind to know he mu&s;t follow me; upon which he informed me that &s;uch behaviour might do in Dub|lin, but that he would teach me better manners; and, immediately &s;eizing my ma&s;ter's trunk, forced it from me; at the &s;ame time honouring me with the familiar appellation of bog-trotting idle &s;coundrel. This la&s;t piece of rude|ne&s;s rou&s;ed me to a &s;tate of de&s;peration, and I was preparing to cha&s;ti&s;e his in|&s;olence, when a countryman of mine, who had overheard the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, informed me that it was my be&s;t way to make it up in the be&s;t manner I could, for that my opponent was an officer of
<PB N="129" REF="127">
the port, in the execution of his duty. I an&s;wered, if he was performing his duty, he &s;hould at lea&s;t do it without in&s;ulting his betters. "Betters!" cried the enraged officer, <Q>and who&s;e bet|ters do you call your&s;elf, you Iri&s;h &s;on of a whore;</Q> at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring the company that I was a no|torious &s;muggler, who wanted to run &s;ome prohibited goods, and offered a bet of a guinea, to any of the &s;tanders-by, that my trunk was full of contra|band commodities. It was in vain that I a&s;&s;ured him to the contrary; and, as I began to find that I had acted wrong in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I wanted to repair it by every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in my power. But I mi&s;took the road to the officer's fa|vour, for the more I humbled my&s;elf, the more in&s;olent and in&s;ufferable was
<PB N="130" REF="128">
his behaviour; and I certainly &s;hould have &s;tood for an hour longer, arguing with him upon the hone&s;ty of my in|tentions, had not my countrymen whi&s;|pered me in the ear to give him a &s;hil|ling. I in&s;tantly took the hint; and the moment he felt the &s;plendid coin touch his palm, his mu&s;cles relaxed into a good-humoured &s;mile, and he told me, with a loud laugh, that I and my box now might go to hell together;&mdash; that he had at fir&s;t taken me for a &s;mug|gler, but upon a clo&s;er acquaintance with me, why he had found his mi&s;take; and, taking me by the hand, told me, he believed I was a damned hone&s;t fellow, and, that if he knew the hou&s;e I was going to, he would come and drink a pot of beer to our better acquaintance. I accepted his offer, told him the &s;ign
<PB N="131" REF="129">
of the inn, and, taking my trunk upon my &s;houlder, &s;et forward to meet my ma&s;ter, who, I found, had been wait|ing for me with great impatience, ha|ving taken a place in the &s;tage for him&s;elf, which was to &s;et out for Lon|don in a few hours, and intended that I &s;hould ride on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that occupied the lieu|tenant's attention was to &s;hake off his temporary metamorpho&s;is, and once more to appear in his real character, which he effected with great expedi|tion; and I had the trunk adju&s;ted and packed ju&s;t time enough for the coach, which had drove round to the front door to receive its new tenants.</P>
<P>When we came to the machine, we found a violent conte&s;t for precedency had taken place between an elderly gen|tlewoman,
<PB N="132" REF="130">
about fifty, who mea&s;ured at lea&s;t three yards round the wai&s;t, and a diminutive woman, who, from the &s;e|verity of her a&s;pect, bore &s;trong cre|dentials of being a neglected virgin: however, after a number of to&s;&s;ings of the head, flirts with the fan, and a pro|digious interchange of ma'ams and mi&s;&s;es, it was determined, by the ma&s;ter of the coach, that the overgrown gen|tlewoman &s;hould have the preference, upon the &s;trength of her name being en|tered fir&s;t on the books.</P>
<P>After them followed my ma&s;ter and the captain of a We&s;t-Indiaman, who had ju&s;t arrived at Liverpool with his cargo, and was going up to London to the &s;hip's owners.</P>
<P>While the in&s;ide pa&s;&s;engers were re|gulating them&s;elves, I mounted the roof
<PB N="133" REF="131">
of the coach, where I was &s;oon joined by a joco&s;e &s;ailor, an Iri&s;h weaver, a young woman, who was going to town to her friends, and an old man, who was muffled up clo&s;e in a frieze great coat.</P>
<P>In this manner we &s;et forward; and, as I felt my &s;ituation very precarious, I took e&s;pecial care to gra&s;p fa&s;t hold of an iron which is nailed to the top of the machine, for the advantage of tho&s;e per|&s;ons, who prefer the benefit of the pro&s;|pect to the ea&s;e of riding within.</P>
<P>We had not proceeded above nine miles, when an accident happened that di&s;compo&s;ed the oeconomy of the whole &s;tage &s;y&s;tem; for our coachman, who wanted to &s;hew his dexterity, in turning the narrow corner of a village, mi&s;&s;ed his aim mo&s;t confoundedly; and, whe|ther
<PB N="134" REF="132">
it was owing to his want of addre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, or the ungovernable &s;pirit of the hor&s;es, I will not take upon me to determine; but certain it is, that he completely over&s;et the machine, in the very wor&s;t part of the road that it could po&s;&s;ibly have happened.</P>
<P>The violence of the &s;hock luckily pitched me farther than my me&s;&s;mates, for I alighted upon a dunghil, without receiving any con&s;iderable injury, except a &s;light brui&s;e. But fortune was not quite &s;o complai&s;ant to my companions, who were plunged deep into a &s;tinking &s;lough, that a neighbouring farmer had kept, time immemorial, for the purpo&s;e of mixing the manure for his land. The &s;ailor and the weaver made &s;hift to di&s;|engage them&s;elves from the un&s;avoury lake; but it was far otherwi&s;e with the
<PB N="135" REF="133">
poor young woman, who had been thrown into the thicke&s;t part of the compo&s;ition, where &s;he lay in a mi&s;era|ble condition, like an amphibious mon|&s;ter, one half of her body being buried in the mud, from her head to her hips, and the re&s;t kicking in the vacant air, tacitly a&s;king the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all well-di&s;po&s;ed Chri&s;tians to re&s;cue her from a &s;ituation, in which if &s;he remained but a few minutes longer, all human aid would, alas! have been ineffectual.</P>
<P>As for the old man, who had &s;hared the &s;ame unhappy de&s;tiny, he made &s;hift to crawl out more like a rat three parts drowned than a human creature, not having the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige left to a&s;cer|tain the nature of the animal tribe he belonged to, except that he walked
<PB N="136" REF="134">
erect, and made u&s;e of two legs in&s;tead of four.</P>
<P>Nor was the con&s;ternation within the coach a whit le&s;s productive of di&s;a&s;ters; for the company there had been thrown by the accident all in a heap, where they lay, intermingled in a rancorous &s;tate of enmity and di&s;cordance, hi&s;&s;ing and an|noying each other, like &s;o many vipers at the bottom of a gla&s;s in a chymi&s;t's &s;hop window.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of this &s;udden cata&s;trophe having reached the people of the village, they poured forth in numbers to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the unfortunate travellers: and the fir&s;t &s;tep they took was to open the coach-window that lay uppermo&s;t, from which aperture they endeavoured to drag out the fat gentlewoman before-mentioned by the legs; but the poor
<PB N="137" REF="135">
fellow, who was mo&s;t forward in the &s;ervice, had good rea&s;on to repent his zeal in her favour; for &s;he, not know|ing the intention of the vi&s;it, no &s;ooner felt a man attempt to get hold of tho&s;e delicate members, than &s;he gave him a mo&s;t villainous kick in the eye, which &s;tunned the poor devil &s;o much that he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to his mother-earth: but, the party being in&s;tantly reinforced, they renewed the attack, and brought out the fu&s;ty amazon by main force, but not be|fore &s;he had &s;ecured the cap and head-dre&s;s of the lady who remained within, with whom, it &s;eems, &s;he had been main|taining a bloody quarrel, but had totally overcome her by dint of per&s;onal prow|e&s;s, and brought out the&s;e emblems of triumph in her hand, which &s;he bran|di&s;hed
<PB N="138" REF="136">
about, to the infinite diver&s;ion of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>After an hour's indu&s;try, on the part of the coachman, the affairs were tole|rably adju&s;ted, and the company were once more preparing to enter the vehi|cle, except Mi&s;s Tippet, for that I un|der&s;tood to be the lady's name, who had been &s;o mauled and defeated within-&s;ide the machine:&mdash;&s;he had determined to re|turn to Liverpool, where &s;he kept a mil|lener's &s;hop, and to bring an action of a&s;&s;ault and battery again&s;t her opponent, whom we now found to be a tallow-chandler's widow, who was her next door neighbour.</P>
<P>After this denunciation of vengeance from the enraged maker of caps, we &s;et forward once more, and, by the time we arrived at Coventry, from the &s;cene
<PB N="139" REF="137">
of our di&s;grace, (in the interval of which nothing material happened,) my ma&s;ter was either &s;o &s;ickened with his compa|nions, or fatigued with that mode of conveyance, that he &s;ignified his intention to the coachman of proceeding no far|ther; and, after bidding adieu to his fellow-&s;ufferers, and giving the coach-man a &s;hilling, to reward him for not quite breaking our necks, we took up our quarters at the principal inn in the city; at the entrance of which my ma&s;ter perceived an old &s;eaman &s;itting at the door, taking out &s;ome tobacco from a leathern pouch. As the features of the man were familiar to the lieutenant, he a&s;ked him where he came from la&s;t; to which the &s;ailor replied, from Plymouth, and that he was almo&s;t foundered on the journey.

<PB N="143" REF="143">
little better than a brute bea&s;t;&mdash;but we can't expect otherwi&s;e for the matter of that; for how &s;hould they know what belongs either to good manners or humanity, when they never were at &s;ea? &mdash; but we can't make a &s;ilk pur&s;e of a &s;ow's ear, as the &s;aying is, &s;o we mu&s;t take the world as it runs, &s;ometimes rough, &s;ometimes &s;mooth, ebb and flood, hey, ma&s;ter.</P>

but &s;he is dead now, and God re&s;t her &s;oul, I &s;ay.</P>
<P>Well, as I was &s;aying, they &s;towed me in the hold of a tender, whence I was put on-board a frigate that lay at the mouth of the river, and was under &s;ailing orders to crui&s;e again&s;t the Spaniards, for we were then at war, you mu&s;t know, with the <HI>Moun&s;eers.</HI></P>
<P>Though I was a little down-heart|ed at fir&s;t, my &s;pirits &s;oon began to revive; for my comrades told me that they expected to take &s;ome rich pri|zes, and, if that was the ca&s;e, why, I &s;hould make my fortune. This was joyful news to me; and, &s;o far from being backward in the bu&s;ine&s;s, my heart beat with impatience till an opportunity &s;hould offer of our coming to clo&s;e quarters with the enemy:&mdash;

and we were not long di&s;appointed; for, the men at the ma&s;t-head &s;eeing a &s;ail, we immediately cleared decks, and bore down upon the ve&s;&s;el. After a run of two hours, we di&s;covered her to be a &s;hip of almo&s;t double our force, and would have tacked about, but, as it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape her then, why, we re&s;olved to give her as warm a reception as we were able, and, damme, to it we went ding dong, and, after a battle of two hours, we obliged the enemy to &s;heer off. We &s;hould have boarded her, indeed; but, half our crew being killed, and the other half de&s;perate|ly wounded, we could not mu&s;ter hands enough to man the long-boat, &s;o we were forced to relinqui&s;h our prize in the moment of victory; which

was a damned hard ca&s;e, ma&s;ter, con|&s;idering as how &s;he was a Spani&s;h galloon, deep laden with the riches of Peru.&mdash;Our rigging and &s;hip were &s;o tattered with the heavy cannon of the enemy, that we were obliged to make the fir&s;t convenient harbour to refit, which we luckily did in a day or two.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you that I received a &s;hot, as I was &s;tanding at one of the guns, which went clean through my &s;houlder, and &s;o I was ordered among the wounded to the ho&s;pital, where, after remaining three months, I was pretty well recovered; and, as &s;oon as I had &s;ufficient &s;trength to do my duty, was turned over to a third-rate, which was to compo&s;e part of a fleet of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="147">I remained on-board &s;ix months, when we returned to Go&s;port; and, as our &s;hip was ordered to the Ea&s;t-Indies, I was advi&s;ed to give a will and power to &s;ome friend in the town to receive my wages and prize-money, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be killed in an en|gagement, or die at &s;ea.

<P>When our &s;hip was properly vic|tualled we &s;et &s;ail; and, after being beat about for upwards of two years, we once more paid a vi&s;it to Old England, where I re&s;olved to &s;et|tle, on my arrival, for life, and with part of my wages to &s;et my&s;elf up in trade.

<P>I was cur&s;edly di&s;pirited at this ac|cident, not knowing where to get &s;uf|ficient to buy me a dinner, when I met with an old &s;hip-mate, who, reading the &s;ituation of my affairs in the lines of my face, lent me a guinea, with which I went and regaled my&s;elf, and, at the &s;ame time, inquired after an old &s;weet|heart of mine, who lived in that neigh|bourhood.

in &s;uch a condition that nobody ex|pected me to live; but, by God's help, I recovered at la&s;t, and had the mor|tification to find that the expences of my illne&s;s had reduced me to my la&s;t guinea; and I was the more chagrin|ed as I wanted to buy &s;ome clothes, to appear as decent as I could, as I intended to make the be&s;t of my way to London to marry little Sall, and then to &s;ettle for life: how&s;om|ever, I made a &s;hift, with the little money I had, and the credit I had procured at a &s;lop-&s;hop, to cut a to|lerable figure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>I go to a tragedy.&mdash;A great no&s;e more ho|noured in a &s;trolling company than great abilities.&mdash;Evil con&s;equence of illiterate critics.&mdash;The gho&s;t proves his mate|riality.&mdash;A family quarrel.&mdash;The me|lancholy i&s;&s;ue of public di&s;putes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be carried away by the invita|tion of the dramatic herald, and, in|quiring for the gallery, entered the the|atre, along with many others, brimful of eager expectation, to &s;ee the perform|ance. The theatre was con&s;tructed with great ingenuity out of an old &s;table, and the only di&s;tinction made between the different places of boxes, pit, and gal|leries,
<PB N="157" REF="157">
was by means of a board nailed acro&s;s.</P>
<P>As the audience, which was compo&s;ed of a motley a&s;&s;emblage of different cha|racters and ages, became riotous, an old man, with one eye, came into the or|che&s;tra, which was made out of a large box, with the lid taken off. After he had bowed re&s;pectfully to the company, he pulled from under his coat the in&s;tru|ment of harmony, and played, with ex|cellent di&s;cretion, the well-known and celebrated tune of <HI>Buttered Peas;</HI> but, the audience growing particularly cla|morous for <HI>Roa&s;t Beef,</HI> this half-&s;ighted mu&s;ician complied with their reque&s;t.&mdash;From his appearance and execution he called &s;trongly to my mind the old gen|tleman, whom I have formerly men|tioned as the Orpheus that moved the
<PB N="158" REF="158">
bear to dance a <HI>fandango,</HI> when I had the honour of being fir&s;t introduced be|hind the &s;cenes of a travelling company in Ireland.</P>
<P>But the bell ringing from within in|dicated to the company that the play was going to begin; and, agreeably to the &s;ummons, the curtain was drawn, and di&s;covered Franci&s;co and Bernardo in clo&s;e conver&s;ation. It was &s;oon no|ticed, by the noi&s;y part of the audience, that Bernardo's no&s;e was of an uncom|mon &s;ize; and indeed it re&s;embled more a protuberance of mulberries, which hung in rich clu&s;ters, than a human fea|ture. I &s;oon found that this gentleman was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous per&s;onage of the drama; for he received more di&s;|tinction, on account of that amazing
<PB N="159" REF="159">
ornament, than all the re&s;t of the actors put together.</P>
<P>When the gho&s;t made his appearance, it had a vi&s;ible effect on the majority of my neighbours in the gallery, &s;ome of whom were almo&s;t petrified with awe at the dreadful &s;olemnity of the object; but, as our admiration is built upon compari&s;on of one thing with another, &s;o did the gha&s;tly appearance of the royal Dane operate to make the &s;ucceed|ing &s;cene more captivating;&mdash;the reader will ea&s;ily conceive that I can mean no other than the brilliant court of Den|mark, which bur&s;t upon our &s;ight with as much grandeur as the wardrobe could furni&s;h, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the credit that the company could procure in the town for tin&s;el, tie-wigs, clean linen, and pot|lids.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">As &s;oon as young Hamlet came for|ward, all eyes were centered upon him, for he had long been con&s;idered as the Ro&s;cius of Warwick&s;hire. I ob&s;erved he made three &s;olemn &s;trides, then en|folded his arms and &s;tood &s;till; for which uncommon excellence he recei|ved the loud applau&s;e of the audience.&mdash;I was going to inquire of a per&s;on, who &s;at next me, into the rea&s;on of their ap|plauding him &s;o much above the re&s;t, when my notice was riveted upon a co|mical fellow, who &s;at near me, roaring out, "Here comes No&s;ey!" which ap|pellation I &s;oon found to belong to my friend Polonius, who was the identical being that had five minutes before per|&s;onated Bernardo with &s;o much honour.</P>
<P>The unexpected &s;alute of my friend in the gallery &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed the mu&s;cles
<PB N="161" REF="161">
of the whole court of Copenhagen, that, in &s;pite of their be&s;t efforts to appear grave, a &s;imper became univer&s;al, and it was &s;ome time before her Dani&s;h ma|je&s;ty could recover her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to reprove the young prince for his un|&s;eemly melancholy: however, every thing went on very &s;moothly until Hamlet be|gan his fir&s;t &s;oliloquy; but he had &s;carce uttered his wi&s;h, that
<Q>"His too, too, &s;olid fle&s;h would melt!"</Q>
than a countryman, who &s;at in the pit, bawled out, <Q>Noa, noa, friend, you needn't wi&s;h any more of thy fle&s;h to melt; why, mon, you're as thin as a whipping-po&s;t already:</Q> and, indeed, though the ob&s;ervation was rather <HI>mal-&agrave;-propos</HI> in point of time, it was &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable on the &s;core of truth; for the poor fellow, who played the character,
<PB N="162" REF="162">
had not fle&s;h enough, upon his whole carca&s;s, to give a cat a breakfa&s;t. How|ever, this interruption was warmly re|&s;ented by the friends of the performer, and a battle would have taken place in the pit, had it not been for the interpo|&s;ition of the manager, who had conde|&s;cended to perform the King him&s;elf: he came round from the &s;tage among the combatants; and, whether it was by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his tongue, or the in|fluence of his dignity, I will not deter|mine; but he certainly re&s;tored peace to the theatre, and the players were or|dered to proceed.</P>
<P>Every thing now went on in the proper <HI>routine</HI> of bu&s;ine&s;s, except in the &s;cene between Laertes and Ophelia, when it was very palpable that the young lady had been imprudent enough to drink
<PB N="163" REF="163">
too much that afternoon; indeed &s;he had hurt her memory &s;o much by the &s;acri|fices &s;he had been making to Bacchus, that &s;he &s;carcely remembered a &s;ingle word of her part, and, in one particular pa&s;&s;age, when the prompter neglected to a&s;&s;i&s;t the fallibility of her memory, &s;he forgot her dignity &s;o far as to damn him for a lazy &s;on of a b&mdash;h; however, the indecorum was committed by a lady, and, con&s;equently, permitted to pa&s;s without cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>But &s;hortly &s;he was relieved from that temporary embarra&s;&s;ment by the entrance of old Polonius, the purple maje&s;ty of who&s;e no&s;e was a never-failing &s;ource of mirth whenever he came forward. Three times did he attempt to give the cele|brated in&s;tructions to his &s;on Laertes, and was as often obliged to de&s;i&s;t, from
<PB N="164" REF="164">
the roars of laughter that i&s;&s;ued when|ever he opened his mouth. At la&s;t they were fairly obliged to conclude the &s;cene without it, and poor Laertes was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to France without the benefit of tho&s;e &s;olid apophthegms of wi&s;dom and experience.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the &s;econd act, attention &s;eemed to have re&s;umed her throne, and every thing jogged on tolerably quiet till the clo&s;et-&s;cene be|tween Hamlet and his mother, when the Gho&s;t made his <HI>entr&eacute;</HI> with prodigious maje&s;ty. I &s;hould have before ob&s;erved, that the wardrobe of this company being rather &s;canty, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make a coat of mail for the &s;pirit in que&s;tion, there being no &s;uit in their cabinet of wearables. To effect this in a hurry, they were obliged to &s;ew a few
<PB N="165" REF="165">
pieces of pa&s;teboard together, which, when covered with old play-bills, made a very tolerable <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for the want of &s;omething more re&s;embling the &s;up|po&s;ed habit of the departed Dane; and, indeed, con&s;idering everything, the poor Gho&s;t acquitted him&s;elf tolerably well until the moment he was preparing to take his leave, when, unluckily, in fa|cing about to the queen, to enforce the di|rections to the young prince to per&s;evere in his conduct toward his mother, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding with his breech to the audience. Now the point of good manners which might have been invaded by this manoeuvre would have been overlooked with great good-hu|mour, but the infringement on decency, that it occa&s;ioned, could not; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the gha&s;tly &s;hade wore a
<PB N="166" REF="166">
black pair of breeches, under his coat of mail, which were rendered &s;omething the wor&s;e by the depredations of time; indeed &s;o much &s;o, that, between the legs, there was a rent of mo&s;t capacious magnitude, out of which a remnant of the &s;pirit's &s;hirt hung in a mo&s;t ungraceful man|ner.</P>
<P>This breach in the galliga&s;kins of the Gho&s;t was no &s;ooner perceived by the motley audience than an univer&s;al uproar en&s;ued, accompanied by ince&s;&s;ant roars of laughter.&mdash;The poor fellow felt him|&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed; and, finding that his per&s;on was the center of the joke, turn|ed him&s;elf to the right and to the left, but without the de&s;ired effect. At la&s;t, mu&s;tering up an unu&s;ual degree of cou|rage, he &s;tepped forward, and attempt|ed to addre&s;s the audience, but was mo&s;t
<PB N="167" REF="167">
violently repelled with groans and hi&s;&s;es. At length, finding all his endeavours ineffectual to learn the &s;tate of their wi&s;hes, he was preparing to walk off; but had not got above a yard from the &s;ide-&s;cene, when an unlucky &s;park, who occupied one of the &s;ide-boxes, &s;et a large pointer, which he had with him, at the mi&s;erable remains of departed maje&s;ty, whom he caught hold of, ju&s;t as he was &s;lipping off the &s;tage, by the &s;hirt, which hung out be|hind, and which he &s;hook, to the un|&s;peakable diver&s;ion of the company, fairly dragging the unfortunate &s;pirit to the center of the &s;tage before he quitted his hold. Irritated to a degree of mad|ne&s;s at this in&s;ult to his dignity, which was more than fle&s;h and blood could en|dure, and eager for revenge, he tore off his paper armour in a twinkling,
<PB N="168" REF="168">
(which, indeed, was tantamount to his &s;tripping in buff, for, the little &s;hirt that he had left, and which compo&s;ed the whole &s;tock of linen that belonged to this calamitous &s;on of The&s;pis, had been completely torn away by the fangs of the animal that had annoyed him,) and, coming to the point of the &s;tage, offered to box the be&s;t man in the company for a gallon of beer: but the Gho&s;t's chal|lenge not being readily accepted, he mi&s;|interpreted their forbearance into a &s;pirit of cowardice in the audience, and began to abu&s;e them in terms which &s;ufficiently proved, that his godfathers and godmo|thers had completely taught him the vul|gar tongue, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e.</P>
<P>Before he had proceeded far in his pa&s;&s;ionate addre&s;s to the &s;pectators, he was &s;topped by a dome&s;tic enemy, who,
<PB N="169" REF="169">
by her great zeal in endeavouring to re|gulate his behaviour, put a period to the dramatic entertainments of the even|ing. This heroine was no other than the unfortunate Gho&s;t's wife, who per|&s;onated her maje&s;ty of Denmark for that night; and, hearing of the mi&s;behaviour of her &s;pou&s;e, hurried to the &s;cene of action, with a full determination to pu|ni&s;h her yoke-fellow for this breach of decency, which, &s;he wi&s;ely apprehended, would be the ruin of her benefit, which was to have taken place the next even|ing. The furious lady, totally regard|le&s;s of the dignity of the character &s;he had a&s;&s;umed in the play, ru&s;hes on her ill-fated hu&s;band, and, by a well-di|rected blow, which, unhappily alighting on his eye, levelled the vaunting &s;pirit with the &s;tage. But, though it was evi|dent
<PB N="170" REF="170">
that the &s;alutation had di&s;concert|ed, it by no means &s;ubdued, him; for, &s;pringing immediately from the boards with great facility, he returned the com|pliment with &s;uch addre&s;s as made the blood-royal of Denmark flow mo&s;t co|piou&s;ly through the apertures of her ma|je&s;ty's no&s;e. Now the audience, begin|ning to interfere warmly in the di&s;pute, leaped upon the &s;tage, and, dividing into different factions, each &s;upported the object they thought mo&s;t aggrieved; but, the majority turning eventually in favour of the lady, &s;he gave her mi&s;era|ble hu&s;band &s;uch a drubbing as almo&s;t deprived him of exi&s;tence, for he lay extended upon the &s;cene of action &s;ight|le&s;s and forlorn, like one who was &s;hort|ly to pay a long vi&s;it to the Stygian &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="171">But it was ordered, by the inflexible de&s;tinies, that the perils of that evening &s;hould not end here; for, while the A|mazonian queen was panting with her victories, and receiving the applau&s;e of her &s;urrounding admirers, the manager of the company entered with two con|&s;tables, and charged her maje&s;ty with a breach of the peace, and in&s;tantly or|dered her to the county-jail, to remain there until time, chance, or circum|&s;tance, &s;hould enable her to &s;atisfy him for the robes of royalty &s;he had utterly de&s;troyed in the engagement, and other properties, which he e&s;timated at a very con&s;iderable amount.</P>
<P>It was at this in&s;tant that the mi&s;|guided heroine began to perceive that &s;he had been acting a very unprofitable part:&mdash;it was in vain for her to hope for
<PB N="172" REF="172">
relief; for, tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who had been mo&s;t in&s;trumental in extolling her prowe&s;s as a brui&s;er, were now mo&s;t forward in ridiculing her di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As the hu&s;band, in the awful eye of the law, is con&s;idered as forming a material part of his wife, the wretched Gho&s;t was lifted from the ground to accompany his lady to pri&s;on, as being re&s;pon&s;ible for her errors; to which place they were convey|ed amid the &s;houts of an unfeeling mul|titude, who inevitably de&s;ert the objects that have delighted them, when their pow|er to amu&s;e exi&s;ts no more.&mdash;The poor Queen, as &s;he was hurried away, turned about, and &s;urveyed the &s;cene of &s;laughter with &s;uch a piteous look as brought the following lines to my recollection:
<Q><L>"The tempe&s;t o'er, and the wild waves allay'd,</L>
<L>"The calm &s;ea wonders at the wrecks it made."</L></Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>We arrive at the metropolis.&mdash;I am di&s;|charged from the lieutenant's &s;ervice.&mdash; Acco&s;ted in the &s;treet by a &s;ingular cha|racter.&mdash;Dine at a flying ordinary.&mdash; Account of my new companion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN this theatric feud had &s;ub|&s;ided, I returned home, and found my ma&s;ter had retired to bed, and left orders for me to be up early in the morning, as he intended to &s;et out for London by break of day. I obeyed his directions, and about five o'clock the next day he hired a po&s;t-chai&s;e, into which he took me as a companion, and we &s;et forward for the metropolis, where we arrived the &s;ame night, after a jour|ney
<PB N="174" REF="174">
of twelve hours, in the pro&s;ecution of which nothing unaccountable hap|pened.</P>
<P>We took up our fir&s;t night's lodging at the inn, where we were conducted by the boy who drove us, and I was awa|kened the next morning by a confu&s;ion of voices in the &s;treet, that, in my opi|nion, put all compari&s;on at defiance. I lay, for &s;ome time, endeavouring to make out the &s;en&s;e of their cries; but that I found totally impo&s;&s;ible, as every &s;yllable they delivered was to me as un|intelligible as if they had been &s;poken in Hebrew.</P>
<P>But, if my wonder was moved by the &s;trange voices I heard, how much more was it excited, when I got up, by the a&s;toni&s;hing objects that I &s;aw!&mdash;At fir&s;t &s;ight the whole world &s;eemed to me to
<PB N="175" REF="175">
be concentered in that amazing city; for, in no other manner could I account for the prodigious hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s that was evidently carrying on in all corners of the town, and the &s;warms of people that crouded upon each other in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The more I contemplated that va&s;t theatre of regular confu&s;ion, the more was I inclined to liken it to an ex|ten&s;ive bee-hive, into which the indu&s;|trious members brought their honey for the advantage of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>The &s;econd morning that I had pa&s;&s;ed at the inn, my ma&s;ter called me into the parlour, and gave me to under&s;tand that his private affairs would oblige him to go to Chatham the next day, and, as he was not quite certain of the time that he might return, he advi&s;ed me to look about for another &s;ervice; at the &s;ame
<PB N="176" REF="176">
time paying me my wages up to that month, and making me a pre&s;ent of a hand&s;ome compliment, over and above the amount, as a &s;mall reward, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, for my good behaviour in his &s;ervice; and, to prove that, even in the &s;malle&s;t particulars, he was not un|mindful of my welfare, he accompanied his favours with a letter of recommenda|tion to a relation of his, who lived in one of the new &s;treets in We&s;tmin&s;ter, that, in ca&s;e he was delayed in the coun|try, by accident or otherwi&s;e, I might not want a friend to give me a good character.</P>
<P>At this la&s;t in&s;tance of his atten|tion I could not avoid bur&s;ting into tears, and I even offered to &s;erve him for nothing, rather than be &s;eparated from a ma&s;ter, to who&s;e intere&s;t I was
<PB N="177" REF="177">
&s;o firmly attached by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of duty and affection; but, as my ap|plication on this head was fruitle&s;s, I was obliged to wander forth in &s;earch of a new employment, with a narrow pur&s;e and a melancholy heart.</P>
<P>After walking up and down the &s;treets of the metropolis for &s;ome hours, I found my&s;elf in the neighbourhood of a place, which, on inquiry, I learned to be the Seven Dials. As my curio&s;ity had been highly gratified by the numerous novel|ties that had pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my ob&s;ervation in the perambulations of the morning, I began to think of indulging another fooli&s;h propen&s;ity, which was, briefly, that of eating; for I found that a rebellion was forming in my inte&s;tines, and which, if not &s;peedily overcome, would endanger the &s;tate, or, in o|ther
<PB N="178" REF="178">
words, I &s;hould be confoundedly &s;ick.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood gaping about, to find out a proper place to &s;atisfy that irre&s;i&s;tible demon, called hunger, I was acco&s;ted very civilly by a per&s;on, who, from his appearance altogether, &s;truck me as an oddity.&mdash;His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a frock that &s;till bore the remnants of finery, but appeared to have been originally made for the accommodation of another per&s;on; a dirty &s;ilk wai&s;tcoat, with &s;ome tarni&s;hed lace; a pair of buck&s;kin breech|es, and boots; his hair, which was rather &s;canty, and as grey as my grandmother's, was twi&s;ted and turned up behind, under a round hat, the brims of which &s;eem|ed to have been narrowed by the niggard hand of oeconomy, for the laudable pur|po&s;e of making it retain its black edge as long as po&s;&s;ible. As he &s;tood with
<PB N="179" REF="179">
his back towards me at fir&s;t &s;ight, I gue&s;&s;ed him to be a &s;mart young buck, about twenty years of age; but, when he faced about, to enter into conver&s;a|tion, I perceived him to be verging on the borders of fifty, and that all his &s;miles and complai&s;ance (of which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;tore) had not been able to defend him again&s;t the inroads of time, for the different mu&s;cles of his vi&s;age were harrowed deep with the fell lines of care, which inter&s;ected each o|ther at right angles.</P>
<P>The polite addre&s;s of this civil origi|nal at once &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed me; for, upon my informing him that I was a &s;tranger, and wanted to know a pro|per place to eat in, he eagerly caught hold of my hand, and exclaimed with a laugh, <Q>Cur&s;e me, but that's lucky for us both! for I have been medi|tating
<PB N="180" REF="180">
upon the &s;ame thing this half hour;</Q> at the &s;ame time advi&s;ing me to follow him. But we had not pro|ceeded many paces, when he &s;uddenly turned about, and inquired, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, "if the captain was &s;trong." As I did not under&s;tand the nature of his que&s;tion, I &s;tared at him with a little &s;urprize; when he told me, with a &s;mile, that he only wi&s;hed to know how I &s;tood for ca&s;h. I immediately pulled out the &s;um total of my wages; upon eyeing which he exclaimed, with the mo&s;t lively tran&s;ports, <Q>Oh! damme, you are &s;trong,&mdash;you can afford to dine like an alderman, I &s;ee;&mdash;come with me, and I'll introduce you to a hou&s;e, in the next &s;treet, where you &s;hall eat like a prince, and a&s;&s;ociate with none but gentlemen.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="181">I would have an&s;wered this rapid ad|dre&s;s, being fearful that he meant to bring me into too much expence; but he did not give me that opportunity; for, darting along with the celerity of an arrow from a bow, he beckoned me to follow him, and, in a few minutes, we arrived at a hou&s;e where beef, mutton, and veal, de|corated the out&s;ide of the windows, and from the door of which i&s;&s;ued &s;uch &s;a|voury &s;teams as made me anticipate in thought the delicious joints that waited our di&s;po&s;al within.</P>
<P>Upon our entering this recep|tacle of the hungry, we were imme|diately u&s;hered into a back room, in the center of which was a large round wooden table, and on its confines &s;at a number of per&s;ons, of all ages, coun|tries, and complexions. We had &s;carce|ly

&s;aluted the company, when a dozen tongues bellowed forth at once, <Q>How are you, Count?</Q> and I &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to know the per&s;on to whom &s;o dignified a title was addre&s;&s;ed, in &s;uch a place, if I had not &s;een my companion acknowledge him&s;elf as the per&s;on alluded to by various &s;ignificant bows and grins, which he exerci&s;ed to|wards his inquiring friends in a manner perfectly peculiar to him&s;elf, and unlike the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>As by this time our quota of beef was placed before us, with all the appen|dages of &s;alt, mu&s;tard, &amp;c. my friend advi&s;ed me to fall to, and follow his example; but I, not doubting in the lea&s;t that I had got into the &s;ociety of &s;ome nobleman in di&s;gui&s;e, was in a manner petrified with fear, and &s;at auk|wardly, fir&s;t &s;urveying my plate and then

him more thou&s;ands than he had fingers, and that he &s;hould return immediately; but, in ca&s;e that he met with a certain nobleman, whom he expected to &s;ee, and &s;hould be detained longer than or|dinary, advi&s;ed me to be under no &s;ort of apprehen&s;ion on that account, as he made it a point to dine at that hou&s;e whenever he was di&s;engaged from the <HI>beau monde.</HI></P>
<P>Though I could not well under&s;tand the nature of &s;uch an apology, from a man of his &s;eeming importance, to an humble being like me, yet I made one of my be&s;t bows, and told him I &s;hould always think my&s;elf honoured to be ble&s;&s;ed with his &s;ociety. He appeared to take this declaration in good part, and, &s;queezing my hand, wi&s;hed the company a good day, and in&s;tantly vani&s;hed from our &s;ight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A grain of prudence more profitable than a pound of vanity.&mdash;The curio&s;ity of the public is no proof of their &s;agacity.&mdash; Popular rage more dreadful than the &s;ting of the law. &mdash; A great man in di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;My rea&s;on blinded by my ambition.&mdash;Our reception at a porter-hou&s;e.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ELATED with my &s;ucce&s;s, and pro|digiou&s;ly vain of tho&s;e abilities which had been the primary cau&s;e, as I imagined, of attaching &s;o great a man to my intere&s;t, I began to form a thou|&s;and &s;chemes for the improvement of my fortune; and could not help reviving the memory of my poor father and mo|ther,
<PB N="192" REF="192">
who had taken &s;uch care of my education, that, &s;hould any of the count's friends think proper to employ me in the capacity of a &s;teward, or o|therwi&s;e, I was intirely fit for their &s;er|vice. &mdash; I had &s;trolled through &s;everal &s;treets, &s;o ab&s;olutely wrapped up in my my reflexions on my future greatne&s;s that I &s;carce heeded or knew where, or on what purpo&s;e, I was going, till I came to the corner of a lane, when an acci|dent happened that broke a&s;under the texture of my reveries.</P>
<P>I was walking along, with my arms enfolded in each other, and my head reclining on my brea&s;t, in deep con|templation, when I received a blow from the end of a ladder, which two men were bringing round the corner, that not only &s;tunned, and deprived me, in an in|&s;tant, of all powers of &s;en&s;ation, but,
<PB N="193" REF="193">
by the force of the blow, drove me back|wards, at lea&s;t ten paces, when I un|luckily &s;taggered again&s;t a tub that &s;tood at the edge of the cellar of a public hou&s;e, where &s;ome draymen were &s;tart|ing porter, which, giving way, accom|panied me in the fall, which was at lea&s;t &s;ix feet perpendicular, and I fell plump into an empty butt, which &s;tood ready to be drawn up.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e, which the tub and I had occa&s;ioned in our de&s;cent, drew together all the people out of the alehou&s;e to ex|plore the cau&s;e; when, lo! poor Tony was di&s;covered lying motionle&s;s at the bot|tom of the ve&s;&s;el. Every means was im|mediately put in practice to relieve me from &s;o uncomfortable a &s;ituation; and, having dragged me up the &s;tairs once more into the regions of day, they
<PB N="194" REF="194">
brought me into the middle of the tap-room, where a barber, who was pre&s;ent, undertook to bleed me, while another poured a gla&s;s of brandy-hot down my throat, in order to re&s;tore me to my &s;trength and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the opera|tions of nature, or the beneficial effects of the pre&s;criptions of my phy&s;icians, that I recovered, remains, to this hour, undetermined; but certain it is that my &s;pirits were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and I was a|gain enabled to pur&s;ue tho&s;e avocations in life which were eventually to lead me into the temple of fortune.&mdash;As I walk|ed along, the pain in my head, which my late di&s;a&s;ter had occa&s;ioned, in a great mea&s;ure reduced that felicity I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have enjoyed, in con|&s;equence of the plea&s;urable notions I
<PB N="195" REF="195">
had conjured up in my brain &s;ince my rencounter with the Sclavonian beau.</P>
<P>But I hardly knew to what point of the compa&s;s I was &s;teering, when I arrived at a large &s;tone gate, through which an immen&s;e number of coaches and carts were pa&s;&s;ing, without intermi&s;&s;ion; and my ears were dinned with a con|tinual noi&s;e and uproar, made up of the bawling of du&s;tmen, the rattling of carriages, and the oaths and exe|crations of coachmen and carmen con|tending, for priority of place, with as much vehemence and bitterne&s;s as if the conte&s;t was the mo&s;t important cir|cum&s;tance of their lives.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood contemplating that &s;cene of bla&s;phemy, I was &s;urrounded by a number of idle people, who were li&s;ten|ing to the &s;trains of a ballad-&s;inger, the
<PB N="196" REF="196">
tenor of who&s;e &s;ong I perceived admi|ni&s;tered great plea&s;ure to the auditory around her. I had &s;carcely been at|tentive above two minutes, before I heard &s;ufficient to make me blu&s;h from ear to ear with confu&s;ion; and, &s;kulk|ing, unperceived, from the croud, I made the be&s;t of my way down the &s;treet, lamenting the defects of a po|lice that permitted &s;uch public incite|ments to debauchery, wounding the mo|rals of the ri&s;ing generation, and an|noying the ears of mode&s;ty, to be &s;ung about the greate&s;t avenues of the capital with impunity.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e reflexions for the public good, I &s;trayed along the path, till my progre&s;s was interrupted by a collection of men, women, and children, who were gaping, with their mouths wide open,
<PB N="197" REF="197">
at a wonderful piece of mechani&s;m, af|fixed again&s;t a church, where two auto|maton figures, they informed me, would &s;trike the quarters. I was wonderfully incited to be pre&s;ent at the operation, and, placing my&s;elf in the center, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the &s;cene of action, waited for the accompli&s;hment of my de&s;ires with the mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity. But, ere that event took place, the whole a&s;&s;embly was thrown into confu&s;ion by the de|tection of a pick-pocket, who had been making &s;omewhat too free with the pur&s;e of a lady that formed a part of the inqui&s;itive group.</P>
<P>When the culprit was brought for|ward, his appearance was altogether &s;uch as &s;truck me with a&s;toni&s;hment; for, conceive what my &s;urprize mu&s;t be, who had always thought that a thief
<PB N="198" REF="198">
bore his credentials to roguery in his forehead, to behold a &s;lim young man, dre&s;&s;ed, at all points, in the utmo&s;t ex|travagance of the fa&s;hion, and who prote&s;ted his innocence in terms of the mo&s;t elegant language, handled by a mercile&s;s mob as one of the fraternity of the lowe&s;t order of human villains; nay, I was in my own mind &s;o perfectly convinced of the fal&s;ehood of the charge, that I felt my&s;elf frequently impelled to &s;tep forward in his defence; and I actually &s;hould have done &s;o, if a very re&s;pectable gentleman had not declared that he was the mo&s;t notorious pick-pocket about town.</P>
<P>As I was eager to be pre&s;ent at the puni&s;hment of a delinquent, whom the laws of the land &s;eem tacitly to exclude from their protection, I followed the
<PB N="199" REF="199">
tattered cavalcade, who proceeded with their pri&s;oner, clo&s;e guarded, to the wa|ter-&s;ide; where, after taking him to &s;ome neighbouring barges that were la|den with coals, they plunged him, un|re&s;trained by a &s;ingle emotion of pity, into the &s;able &s;tream, where he was forced to remain for upwards of twenty minutes, floundering for his life amid&s;t a congregation of filth, di&s;embogued from all corners of the metropolis, and interlarded with dead cats, drowned puppies, &s;tinking fi&s;h, and other offen|&s;ive matter, more abhorrent to the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling than all the e&s;&s;ence of Pan|dora's cabinet. When he had under|gone a &s;ufficient &s;hare of puni&s;hment for his mal-practices, a tender-hearted waterman,
<Q>"Touch'd with a generous &s;en&s;e of human woe,"</Q>
<PB N="200" REF="200">
took the poor devil into his boat, and rowed away with the fallen under&s;trap|per of Mercury amid the di&s;cordant groans of the million that crouded the &s;hores of old Thames.</P>
<P>As the evening was now approaching very fa&s;t, I thought it prudent to make the be&s;t of my way back to the inn, being a &s;tranger in town, and not know|ing where to procure a lodging imme|diately. I was on my way thither, re|&s;olving to get up early the next morn|ing to deliver my letter to my late ma&s;|ter's friend in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and after|wards to meet the count, agreeable to appointment, at the eating-hou&s;e near the Seven Dials.</P>
<P>But, luckily, as I came to the foot of Blackfriers Bridge, I met my noble acquaintance once more. The ren|counter
<PB N="201" REF="201">
happened as follows.&mdash;I &s;aw a mob of people collecting very fa&s;t, at a little di&s;tance from the place I was pa&s;&s;ing; and, hearing &s;ome very high words pa&s;s, I walked up to inquire into the cau&s;e, when I beheld a woman, of a very vulgar appearance, who had fa&s;|tened one hand in the collar of a gen|tleman, whom &s;he was dragging along the pavement, while, with the other, &s;he was threatening to knock him down, if he made the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; and he, in the mo&s;t piteous manner, was intreat|ing the croud to take his part.</P>
<P>I was pu&s;hing the people on one &s;ide, to inquire more fully into the matter, when I beheld, to my utter grief and &s;urpri&s;e, that the unfortunate hero was no other than the very individual count, who had behaved with &s;uch politene&s;s
<PB N="202" REF="202">
to me in the preceding part of the day. I was &s;o enraged to &s;ee the only gentle|man I had met with &s;ince my landing in England, who, in my opinion, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed either tenderne&s;s or urbanity, treated in &s;uch a rude manner, that I in&s;tantaneou&s;ly lifted up my &s;tick to &s;trike the furious Amazon to the earth, in order to liberate my friend; but I pre&s;ently found my arms were pinioned behind me by the mob, who reprobated my conduct, for endeavouring to re&s;cue a man who had refu&s;ed to pay his law|ful debts. This charge made me fire with &s;uch rage that I could not avoid telling the fellow, who advanced it, that it was a lie; for the gentleman was my friend, and not only a man of honour but likewi&s;e of great fortune. This la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion rou&s;ed the attention of the wo|man
<PB N="203" REF="203">
who had him in cu&s;tody, and &s;he in|&s;tantly retorted, "He a man of fortune! &mdash;he be damned, a poor, half-&s;tarved, would-be, gentleman; &mdash; the devil take &s;uch mungrels, I &s;ay; &mdash; why don't he pay me my bill? &mdash; an&s;wer me that."&mdash;"And &s;o he will, I am &s;ure," replied I, "if your demand is a ju&s;t one."&mdash;"Ju&s;t!" &s;ays the fu|rious gentlewoman, "and who are you, pray, that take upon you to di&s;pute the ju&s;tice of the matter, I &s;hould be glad to know?&mdash;will you pay his bill for him?"&mdash;"Aye, my dear friend, do," &s;aid the count, "and I &s;hall be for ever devoted to your &s;ervice;&mdash; it is but a trifle, only nine &s;hillings and &s;even pence, upon my &s;oul."&mdash; Yes," &s;ays his per&s;ecutre&s;s, "and it has been due the&s;e nine months for
<PB N="204" REF="204">
my hard labour."&mdash;Here the count de&s;ired to &s;peak to me, and whi&s;pered in my ear that it was a trifling bill for wa&s;hing, which he had incurred ju&s;t be|fore his la&s;t remittance from abroad, and that ever &s;ince it had &s;lipped his memory; but he reque&s;ted me, for the love of God, to pay the money, if I had it a|bout me, and not let him &s;uffer &s;uch a public di&s;grace any longer.</P>
<P>I felt my bowels of compa&s;&s;ion incline very much to &s;erve the di&s;a&s;trous noble|man, and involuntarily pulled out all the ca&s;h I had left except one guinea, which I had formerly &s;ewed up in the wai&s;tband of my breeches, to &s;tand my friend in ca&s;e of any &s;udden emergency. When the &s;carlet-faced laundre&s;s &s;aw me pull out my money, in obedience to the count's intreaties, &s;he quitted her prey,
<PB N="205" REF="205">
and I paid her the amount of her bill. When &s;he had fingered the ca&s;h, after looking in my face with a &s;ignificant eye, &s;he bur&s;t into a loud laugh, and, taking her leave, wi&s;hed me joy of my new acquaintance.</P>
<P>As this di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s was now &s;ettled, and the count emancipated from his fears, we thought of retiring to &s;ome hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, to &s;ettle the plan of operations for the en&s;uing day.&mdash;I was looking about me, in &s;earch of a beer-drinking <HI>caravan&s;era,</HI> when my facetious a&s;&s;ociate, taking me under the arm, informed me that he would conduct me to a hou&s;e, not very far from us, where the porter was good and the company excellent.</P>
<P>As we proceeded along, I ventured to make my companion acquainted with
<PB N="206" REF="206">
the reduced &s;tate of my finances, and the little hope I had of recruiting it un|til I &s;hould get into &s;ome &s;ervice. At the word <HI>&s;ervice</HI> the count &s;tared, and &s;aid, he conceived it impo&s;&s;ible that a per&s;on of my accompli&s;hments could think of &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the whims and caprice of the fir&s;t prince in Chri&s;|tendom; be&s;ides, added he, your edu|cation, I perceive, is liberal, your man|ners polite, and your per&s;on irre&s;i&s;tible. &mdash;"Damme," adds the count, putting a gla&s;s to his eye, and &s;urveying me from head to foot, "if I ever &s;aw a prettier, tighter, lighter, more genteel, bit of humanity in the three kingdoms.&mdash; Oh! zounds!" continues he, "you mu&s;t put the notion of &s;ervitude in|tirely out of your head, unle&s;s it is that of the ladies:&mdash;why, man," &s;ays
<PB N="207" REF="207">
he, "I'll introduce you to a circle of the fir&s;t-rate toa&s;ts in the capital, all prodigious fortunes, and there's no doubt but you may marry the fir&s;t wo|man you take a liking to."</P>
<P>Though I was charmed to exta&s;y with the count's extravagant flattery of my per&s;on and mental endowments, of which I conceived no very contemptible idea my&s;elf, yet I could not re&s;i&s;t pointing out to my companion &s;ome &s;mall impe|diments, which I imagined fate would throw in my way to bar the progre&s;s of my good fortune, namely, that of pro|per clothes to appear in. But I had &s;carcely hinted my doubts, when he kindly informed me that his wardrobe was intirely at my &s;ervice, where I might pick and choo&s;e out of all the colours of the rainbow; at the &s;ame time a&s;king
<PB N="208" REF="208">
me what colour I thought mo&s;t advan|tageous to my complexion; and, upon my an&s;wering I thought blue was as be|coming as any, he told me, with a face of deep concern, that he was cur&s;edly mortified that the blue could not be had, for he had given it away but the morning before to a half-pay lieutenant, with a wife and &s;even children.&mdash;"Oh! my dear &s;ir," rejoined I, "don't trou|ble your&s;elf, the &s;carlet will do very well."&mdash;"The &s;carlet, you &s;aid," &s;ays the count.&mdash;"Yes," I replied, "if it was agreeable to him."&mdash;"Why, my dear friend," rejoins the beau, "it is perfectly agreeable, but, damn it, at pre&s;ent it's totally impo&s;&s;ible; for I lent that very coat la&s;t week to a gen|tleman of my acquaintance to go to the opera; his own tailor, you mu&s;t

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A proof of the ea&s;e with which great men can reconcile them&s;elves to low com|pany.&mdash;The plea&s;ures of conviviality.&mdash;My apprehen&s;ions of &s;leeping in the &s;treet removed by the count's friend&s;hip.&mdash;Amu&s;ed with a tale of a tub.&mdash;Find my&s;elf made an egregious a&s;s.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the &s;miles of the landlady towards my companion, I perceived that he was no le&s;s than a warm favourite in her eye; for &s;he came out of the bar, in which &s;he had hitherto been engaged, accom|modating a tailor's lady with a pint of geneva, and u&s;hered us into a back room, the door of which was &s;carcely opened, when there i&s;&s;ued forth &s;uch
<PB N="213" REF="213">
abundant volumes of &s;moke as could hardly be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in the avenues of the infernal regions.</P>
<P>When we had taken our &s;eats in this den of oblivion, (for the appellation of room it certainly did not de&s;erve,) the clouds began to di&s;&s;ipate, that had made every object in the room impervious to my view, and I found my&s;elf flanked on each &s;ide with a &s;ociety of mirth-in|&s;piring mortals, who, by the trifling a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pipe and a &s;ong, &s;eemed to have totally excluded care from their magic cavern. After I was formally introduced to the &s;ociety by my friend, as an hone&s;t fellow and a <HI>bon vivant,</HI> we took our &s;eats round the table of A|nacreon; and the pre&s;ident of the even|ing commanded &s;ilence for a favourite catch, which was delivered, in high
<PB N="214" REF="214">
&s;tyle, by three of the members. After this followed a &s;entiment, which, as it &s;avoured infinitely more of wit than de|cency, I &s;hall forbear to repeat.</P>
<P>When it came to the count's turn to &s;ing, he in&s;tantly gave them the well-known ditty of "Death and the Lady" in character, and interlarded it with &s;uch inimitable &s;trokes of comic humour and expre&s;&s;ion of countenance, as made me well nigh bur&s;t with laughter. At the conclu&s;ion of this effort of the count's, the whole circle congratulated him upon the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his ri&s;ible powers.</P>
<P>Now it came to my turn to make an offering at the &s;hrine of Comus, and I was reque&s;ted by the pre&s;ident, in the name of the company, to favour them with a &s;ong. I made every apology to excu&s;e the performance which my in|genuity
<PB N="215" REF="215">
could &s;ugge&s;t, but found my&s;elf &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by the intreaties of my companions that I mu&s;t have complied, if a good-natured young man, who &s;at at my left hand, and who perceived the embarra&s;&s;ment the reque&s;t had thrown me into, had not voluntarily offered, with my permi&s;&s;ion, to become my &s;ub|&s;titute. As this propo&s;al was backed by a few well-timed ob&s;ervations by the count, I was excu&s;ed, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the evening went forward as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>When it grew late, and the company began to drop off one by one, I com|municated to my boon a&s;&s;ociate the ne|ce&s;&s;ity I was under of going to bed, and likewi&s;e told him of the engagement I had to fulfil the next day; but he com|forted me, by the a&s;&s;urance that he would take care and find me a proper

night's lodging. With this declaration I remained &s;atisfied, as I was convinced that he mu&s;t know the town much better than I po&s;&s;ibly could, who had &s;carcely breathed in it above twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>As the bowl of punch, over which we held this argument, was now demoli&s;hed, it was propo&s;ed to fill another, to which I offered &s;ome &s;light objections that were in&s;tantly over-ruled by the count, who, wholly regardle&s;s of my remarks, order|ed it to be repleni&s;hed, and then, whi&s;|pering in my ear, informed me, that he would introduce me to the friend&s;hip of the young fellow who kindly &s;ang in my room; who, he a&s;&s;ured me, was a per|&s;on well worth my acquaintance, and who would prove of great &s;ervice to me in the pur&s;uits which he intended I &s;hould follow, as &s;oon as I had received
<PB N="217" REF="217">
a little of the poli&s;h, nece&s;&s;ary to cut any thing like a capital figure in life. I thanked him for this new in&s;tance of his regard; and, agreeably to his word, he recommended me, in the mo&s;t forcible manner, to the protection of his friend; having previou&s;ly whi&s;pered him, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to excu&s;e the ba&s;hfulne&s;s of my demeanour.</P>
<P>Were I to &s;et down one half of the compliments which were paid to the graces of my per&s;on, by the count and my new ally, during the demolition of the punch, you would naturally imagine that I was the vaine&s;t of all human be|ings; for, while one was prai&s;ing the ringlets of hair that flowed loo&s;ely down my back, the other di&s;covered that I had the be&s;t-turned ancle and the neat|e&s;t leg he ever &s;aw; ob&s;ervations, to
<PB N="218" REF="218">
which I gave full credit, as I really had &s;ome cau&s;e to value my&s;elf upon the &s;ymmetry of my limbs; and &s;o much was I bewildered by the exce&s;&s;ive incen&s;e of their flattery, that I did not per|ceive what was going forward till the landlady had ab&s;olutely made another bowl, and placed it on the table before us. Now the apprehen&s;ions for my health overcame every other con&s;idera|tion; for, not being accu&s;tomed to keep &s;uch late hours, and, be&s;ides, finding that the fumes of the liquor had mount|ed into my upper &s;tory, or, in other words, that my brain was affected, I made a motion for departing. But this the count ab&s;olutely forbade, and paint|ed the dangers &s;o forcibly, which a &s;tran|ger to the manners of the town had to expect from walking, at &s;uch a late hour
<PB N="219" REF="219">
of the night, alone, that I trembled in idea, and began to u&s;e every per&s;ua&s;ion to induce him to accompany me, which at la&s;t he promi&s;ed to comply with as &s;oon as he had demoli&s;hed the liquor which &s;o invitingly courted his em|braces.</P>
<P>Here the count took an opportunity of informing our common friend to what purpo&s;e he meant to dedicate my per|&s;onal accompli&s;hments, which was no other than to have me introduced to the notice of &s;ome ladies of fortune and di&s;tinction, of his acquaintance, and, by the aid of a little manoeuvring, en|forced by the beauties of my per&s;on, to &s;nap up &s;ome young tit of quality, who&s;e fortune would make me independent for life. I was &s;o elated with this uncom|mon zeal of the count for my happine&s;s,
<PB N="220" REF="220">
that my eyes &s;wam with tears of grati|tude and joy;&mdash;I thanked him in the mo&s;t extravagant and lively terms of language, promi&s;ing to obey his direc|tions in every particular of my life; and would have pro&s;trated my&s;elf at his feet, and called upon Heaven to reward his friendly heart, had he not ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted upon the contrary.</P>
<P>Now, the watchman giving us notice that it was between two and three o'clock in the morning, it was judged expedient to pay our reckoning, and depart in peace; and, upon the landlady's ap|proach with her bill, I told her we would &s;ettle as &s;oon as our companion return|ed; for, upon our mentioning the word <HI>payment,</HI> I had ob&s;erved he took his hat and &s;lipped out of the room. Here &s;he thought proper to &s;et me right, by a&s;&s;u|ring
<PB N="221" REF="221">
me that the gentleman we alluded to had been gone home above the&s;e ten minutes, and, probably, that &s;he might not &s;et eyes upon him for three months to come, and if &s;he never did again &s;he &s;hould not break her heart. Upon receiving this unwelcome intelligence, I a&s;ked who was to pay his part; to which &s;he replied, that was a matter we &s;hould have &s;ettled among our&s;elves before he thought proper to decamp;&mdash; that &s;he &s;hould look to me for the mo|ney, which I mu&s;t pay her immediately, for &s;he had a heavy bill to make up for her di&s;tiller, whom &s;he expected to call the next day, and could not afford to lo&s;e her moderate profits in compliment to any vagabond upon earth.</P>
<P>Finding no re&s;ource left but by pay|ing the money, I a&s;ked for her bill,
<PB N="222" REF="222">
which amounting to &s;ix &s;hillings and nine-pence more than I had in my pocket, I turned about to con&s;ult the count what mea&s;ure we mu&s;t follow in this mi&s;erable dilemma, when, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, I found he was gone al&s;o; however, imagining that he would &s;hortly return, I &s;at in the utmo&s;t im|patience, meaning that he &s;hould pa&s;s his word with the woman of the hou&s;e for the remainder. But, having &s;at a con&s;iderable time, and no count ap|pearing, I told the woman that I had not money &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the bill totally, but that I would give her what I had, and that my friend &s;hould be an&s;werable for the remainder. &mdash; "What friend, pray?" &s;ays the lady of the bar.&mdash;"The count," an&s;wered I. &mdash;"The count!" replied &s;he, in accents
<PB N="223" REF="223">
of di&s;dain, <Q>yes, yes, he is a pretty fellow, indeed, to pa&s;s his word!&mdash; why, my good friend, I don't know whether you're &s;erious or not; but, give me leave to tell you, that I wou'dn't take his word, no, nor his oath neither, for &s;ix farthings, much le&s;s for &s;ix &s;hillings.</Q>&mdash;Here my choler ro&s;e, to hear my friend's cha|racter &s;o villanou&s;ly traduced; and, a&s;|&s;uming all the importance I was able, I told her, &s;he ought to be a&s;hamed of mentioning the name of &s;o accompli&s;hed a gentleman with di&s;re&s;pect.&mdash;"A gen|tleman, indeed!" replied the angry ho&s;te&s;s, "a ra&s;cal, you mean! &mdash; why, he's as poor as a half-pay officer, and doesn't eat a dinner above three times a week, and that's at the expence of &s;ome credulous fool or another."</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="224">At this relation of the landlady's the blood for&s;ook my cheeks, and an uni|ver&s;al panic &s;eized my whole frame; for, comparing the po&s;itivene&s;s of her a&s;&s;ertions with the apparent poverty of my companion and the &s;habbine&s;s of his habiliments, I could not help gi|ving full credit to her tale, though it was at the expence of my di&s;cernment as a man, and my deare&s;t hopes for ever. The woman, perceiving my &s;ituation, and the callow innocence of my mind, offered to take what money I had about me, and a pledge for the remainder, until it &s;hould be convenient for me to call to di&s;charge the whole.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I went along, mu&s;ing on the iniquities of the world, my ears were a&s;&s;ailed with the cries of a female. I no &s;ooner heard the voice of di&s;tre&s;s than my feelings took the alarm, being always eager to remove the &s;orrows of any, but particularly a woman's. When I came to the place of action, I found a poor
<PB N="227" REF="227">
creature on the ground, &s;truggling with a man, who &s;truck at her &s;everal times; but, the moment her eyes caught my approach, &s;he prayed, for the love of Je&s;us, that I would a&s;&s;i&s;t her. On &s;uch an occa&s;ion I never wanted any other monitor than my humanity, and, guided by that impul&s;e, I entered into her quar|rel with &s;uch zeal and activity, that, in le&s;s than ten minutes, I laid her oppre&s;|&s;or breathle&s;s at my feet.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of our combat had attract|ed the notice of &s;ome watchmen, who, gathering round us, made an inquiry into the nature of &s;uch a breach of the peace at that dead hour of the night. I was going to inform them of the true &s;tate of the matter, when the vanqui&s;hed hero, who lay bleeding in the &s;treet, charged the watch to take me into cu&s;|tody,
<PB N="228" REF="228">
as a villain who wanted to rob and murder him. The words had &s;carce|ly e&s;caped his lips, when I was &s;ecured by the&s;e hone&s;t de&s;cendents of Time, who, tally regardle&s;s of all my prote&s;tations to the contrary, conveyed me to the watch-hou&s;e, accompanied by the wretch who had accu&s;ed me, with his face and clothes be&s;meared all over with blood. As for the girl, in who&s;e defence I had thus ri&s;ked my life and liberty, &s;he had thought proper to decamp as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible from the &s;cene of the affray, having &s;olid rea&s;ons to di&s;like the &s;ociety of a watchman, and a natural antipathy to the in&s;ide of a hou&s;e of correction.</P>
<P>When we had made our entrance into the watch-hou&s;e, I was brought before the con&s;table of the night, whom we found in an inner room, enjoying him|&s;elf
<PB N="229" REF="229">
with a pot of porter and a pipe, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the duties of his holy office by a drunken buck, who had taken up his night's lodging in the round-hou&s;e, to &s;ee life, and enjoy a bit of &s;un. When the fellow, whom I had beaten, had ex|hibited his charge again&s;t me, in which he was &s;upported by the watchmen, the con&s;table, a&s;&s;uming all the magi&s;terial dignity he was able, turning to me, &s;aid, <Q>Well, you dog, what have you to &s;ay in your defence?</Q> Frightened out of my &s;en&s;es at being brought to a tri|bunal of ju&s;tice, I confe&s;&s;ed the whole matter, from beginning to end, and had the con&s;olation to under&s;tand, from the inebriate gentleman who &s;at by the watch-hou&s;e fire, and who perceived my ignorance of the town, that I &s;hould certainly be hanged, for that there was
<PB N="230" REF="230">
not a &s;hadow of doubt but the man would die. If he had taken a pi&s;tol and &s;hot me through the head, it could not have more completely deprived me of the powers of &s;en&s;ation: &mdash; I &s;tood, for &s;ome minutes, motionle&s;s as a &s;ta|tue; at length my tears made way for my relief, and I wept, with the utmo&s;t contrition, for the horror of an act that would not only take away the life of a fellow-creature, but involve my own in its dreadful con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely dried my eyes, when a man, of a very genteel a&s;pect, entered with a ragged pro&s;titute, whom he charged with having privately robbed him of his watch. It appeared, in the cour&s;e of her examination, that &s;he had conveyed it to a watchman, who, it &s;eemed, went &s;hares in her profits, and
<PB N="231" REF="231">
who advi&s;ed her, in ca&s;e the gentleman &s;hould return and claim his property, to charge him as having attempted to u&s;e her ill, and by that means oblige him not only to relinqui&s;h all farther claim to the trinket they had pilfered, but to purcha&s;e his relea&s;e at a very con&s;ider|able amount. But the gentleman, who was a rigid ob&s;erver of the laws, was &s;o far from being intimidated by the threats of the woman, or the apprehen&s;ions of appearing publicly on &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s in a court of ju&s;tice, that he made it a point to have her &s;ecured, in &s;pite of the manoeuvres of her friend and his fraternity. Upon her confe&s;&s;ing the whole affair, and giving up the watch|man as her colleague, who re&s;tored the gentleman his watch upon a previous promi&s;e of pardon, he con&s;ented to let
<PB N="232" REF="232">
her go; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hould have found an uncom|mon &s;atisfaction in bringing &s;o infamous a villain, as the ra&s;cally retainer of time, to public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As the petty feuds of the night are not to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in watch-hou&s;es with|out &s;ome copious oblations to the &s;hrine of Bacchus, the gentleman, in conformity to &s;o laudable and e&s;tabli&s;hed a cu&s;tom, ordered a bottle of wine, over which the con&s;table, the buck, and him&s;elf, &s;at di&s;cour&s;ing for an hour, to the great joy of all the di&s;turbers of the night; for the pre&s;iding magi&s;trate was a man of &s;uch a convivial kidney as would not be called from the enjoyment of his bottle to &s;ettle the claims of ju&s;tice, if they were even demanded by the fir&s;t man in the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="233">After pa&s;&s;ing a mo&s;t comfortle&s;s and horrid night, about nine in the morn|ing I was taken up to one of the rotation-offices, and examined relative to the bloody charges exhibited again&s;t me:&mdash;I trembled all the way, and went to this mock-tribunal of legi&s;lative au|thority like a criminal under &s;entence of death; for I verily believed the hour was now arrived when I &s;hould end all my mi&s;eries by an ignominious death. But, fortunately, a circum&s;tance took place at the office that changed my ap|prehen&s;ions into tran&s;ports. Previous to our arrival, a gentleman, who had been robbed the week before on Houn|&s;low Heath, had attended the examina|tion of two men, who were taken up on &s;u&s;picion of being guilty of the robbery; but, finding they were not the per&s;ons
<PB N="234" REF="234">
who had committed the fact, he was coming down the &s;teps of the door, on his departure, when he met the whole troop, who were conducting me and my accu&s;er before the &s;itting magi&s;trate. Anxious to learn the cau&s;e of a piece of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o apparently dreadful, he turned back, and, ju&s;t as I and the villain who had charged me fal&s;ely were brought to the bar, the gentleman, pointing to my pro&s;ecutor, exclaimed with a &s;trong empha&s;is, like Nathan in holy writ, "Thou art the man!"&mdash; "What man?" replied the ju&s;tice.&mdash; "The man who committed the rob|bery," &s;ays the gentleman. Upon the &s;trength of his authority, the villain, who was endeavouring to harra&s;s me for exerci&s;ing the feelings of a Chri&s;|tian, was, in his turn, &s;ecured and
<PB N="235" REF="235">
examined; in the cour&s;e of which he owned the commi&s;&s;ion of the fact, and in the confu&s;ion of his mind acknow|ledged that I had neither robbed or in any manner ill-u&s;ed him, but ratified, in every particular, the account I had pre|viou&s;ly delivered before the con&s;table of the night. In con&s;equence of the hap|py i&s;&s;ue of this woe-fraught adventure I was immediately &s;et at liberty, and the poor devil, who&s;e bones I had &s;o bela|boured in the morning, was handcuffed and conveyed to pri&s;on, to await, in durance vile, the awful &s;entence of the law.</P>
<P>When I found my&s;elf once more unre|&s;trained, and in the middle of the &s;treet, at liberty to follow which path I liked be&s;t, I thought my heart would have leaped through my ribs for joy. My
<PB N="236" REF="236">
extacies were, indeed, &s;omewhat allayed by the recollection that I had not a &s;ix|pence in my pur&s;e, but yet not &s;uffi|ciently &s;o to make me &s;ad; for all ideas relative to money became now but a &s;e|condary con&s;ideration in my &s;cale of fe|licity, and that circum&s;tance, which would have made me wretched the day before, was now ab&s;orbed in the &s;elf-congratulations of e&s;cape from &s;o pe|rilous a &s;ituation:&mdash;&s;o much does the happine&s;s of our lives, as well as the beauty of objects, depend upon oppo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>As the perturbation of my &s;pirits be|gan to &s;ub&s;ide, a &s;en&s;e of the misfor|tunes that &s;till hovered round me began to operate with accumulated force. I knew not whither to turn my &s;teps to procure a dinner, much le&s;s all tho&s;e comforts
<PB N="237" REF="237">
of which I had been deprived by the &s;illy expenditure of my money in the pur&s;uit of a &s;hadow.
