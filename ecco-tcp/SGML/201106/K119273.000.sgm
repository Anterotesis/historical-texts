<HEAD>THE REMARKABLE EFFECTS OF FIXED AIR In Mortifications of the Extremities.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. BUDWORTH, a midwife, of Ep&s;om, aged 90, was &s;eized, on the 19th of January, 1780, with a violent inflam|mation on the calf of the leg, attended with excruciating pain. It came out, upon enqui|ry, that &s;he had been &s;ubject, for five or &s;ix months before, to occa&s;ional chills, or &s;hiver|ings, which were attributed to her years; but, upon the whole, &s;he had been as well as people commonly are at &s;o advanced an age. She had frequently experienced erratic pains in the lower
<PB N="2" REF="3">extremities for many years preceding, and lat|terly her legs and feet would occa&s;ionally be|come oedematous; but &s;he had never been at|tacked by any complaint of con&s;equence, which probably was owing to a very regular, or rather ab&s;temious, mode of living. Not|with&s;tanding there was a very con&s;iderable in|flammation of the part, the pul&s;e was neither hard nor very quick. Indeed the degree of fever was by no means &s;o &s;trongly marked in the pul&s;e as it was in the tongue, which was dry, rough, and di&s;coloured. I applied the Saturnine poultice to the leg, and directed four &s;poonfuls of the following mixture to be taken every &s;ix hours:</P>
<P>Take of decoction of the bark, 6 oz. and a half; Huxham's tincture of bark, one ounce; Thebaic tincture, one drachm and a half; cordial confection, one drachm; &s;olutive &s;yrup, two drachms; Mix them together.</P>
<P>The next day the pain and inflammation were much the &s;ame, and the poultice and mixture were continued as before.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P>21&s;t. The medicines had not been regularly given. The inflammation was extended as low down as the heel, with a livid appearance; and ve&s;ications here and there, with a black|ne&s;s underneath, denoted the mortification to be begun. I applied a poultice, of lin&s;eed|flour with elder-ointment, over the whole leg and heel, renewing it twice a day, and conti|nued the mixture. Her diet was &s;ago, &s;alop, and water-gruel, with the addition of a little brandy, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</P>
<P>From this time to February the 20th, the mortification &s;pread &s;lowly, and at length reached the heel. The medicines were taken very irregularly; but, when &s;he did take them, it was ob&s;erved they relieved the pain. The body was occa&s;ionally kept open by an infu&s;ion of &s;ena, and &s;ometimes an emollient cly&s;ter was thrown up. She took brandy and wine freely with her gruel and &s;ago, and &s;ometimes would get down a bit of veal or chicken.</P>
<P>She now (February 20) refu&s;ed medicine al|together: I therefore re&s;olved to try the effects of a fermenting poultice. I applied a compo|&s;ition of flour, ye&s;t, and honey, in the act of
<PB N="4" REF="5">fermentation, laying it on thick over the whole affected part. Upon taking it off, at the end of thirty-&s;ix hours, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the alteration. There was a free di&s;charge of thin matter; the lividne&s;s was abated; and the painful twitch|ings, which for &s;ome days pa&s;t had been very trouble&s;ome, were con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>February 23, 24, 25. The catapla&s;m was renewed daily, and the &s;loughs (which were about-half an inch deep) &s;eparated fa&s;t: the twitchings le&s;s painful, and le&s;s frequent.</P>
<P>March the 1&s;t. The &s;loughs were quite &s;eparated, and the ulcer began to cicatri&s;e. The pain was gone, and her health vi&s;ibly im|proved.</P>
<P>March the 2d. A &s;pot upon the os &s;acrum was &s;hewn me this day, of the &s;ize of a half|crown, black and mortified. I directed &s;ome of the &s;ame poultice to be made, &s;tiffer than the former, and applied upon leather. By the 7th a dige&s;tion was effected, and the part put on the appearance of healing. In the mean time the &s;ore in the leg continued to heal.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>March the 8th. She was taken with a faint|ing-fit, from which &s;he was recovered with &s;ome difficulty. I directed a cordial mixture, but &s;he could take but little of it; and, refu|&s;ing all nouri&s;hment, &s;unk gradually, and ex|pired the next day.</P>
<P>The day before &s;he died, I examined the leg. The &s;ore looked very pale, and rather dry; but there was not the lea&s;t appearance that threatened a return of the mortification. The &s;ore had contracted about a fifth part.</P>
<P>The fermenting catapla&s;m I made u&s;e of in this ca&s;e, was made thus: Take of honey two parts, ye&s;t one part, wheat-flour a &s;ufficient quantity to form a con&s;i&s;tence neither &s;tiff nor &s;oft; &s;et it before the fire, and apply it when it begins to ri&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was Mr. Buckle's particular reque&s;t that his ca&s;e &s;hould be publi&s;hed.</NOTE> CHRISTOPHER BUCKLE, E&s;q. of Ban&s;tead, near this place, aged 70, was at|tacked with a mortification of the great toe, January the 11th, 1780, without any prece|ding illne&s;s. It appeared in the form of a
<PB N="6" REF="7">black &s;peck at the top of the toe clo&s;e to the nail, and the ball of the toe was livid and em|phy&s;ematous. I directed him to make u&s;e of the following fomentation twice or three times a day, an hour at a time:</P>
<P>Take of crude &s;alt of ammoniac, an ounce; camphorated &s;pirits of wine, two pints; Mix them together.</P>
<P>After &s;omenting, the toe was dre&s;&s;ed with bal&s;am of copaiba, warm, and a large poultice was applied of lin&s;eed flour with a little lard. A drachm of the bark, in powder, was given every four hours; and he was to keep his body open with the Scotch pills.</P>
<P>January the 14th. The toe was very flaccid, which induced me to make an inci&s;ion into it; when I di&s;charged, without pain, a pale watery fluid. I now wi&s;hed him to try opium in conjunction with the bark; but, as I could not per&s;uade him to take opium internally, I contented my&s;elf with di&s;&s;olving two ounces of it in the fomentation.</P>
<P>By January the 22d, the mortification was &s;pread, and ve&s;ications appeared on the &s;e|cond, third, and fourth, toes. I now pre|vailed
<PB N="7" REF="8">upon Mr. Buckle to allow the addition of Thebaic tincture, of which he took 120 drops every twenty-four hours, and an ounce of bark, in &s;ub&s;tance, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>January the 25th. The mortification was &s;topped; but, the event being &s;till very du|bious, I reque&s;ted farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A gen|tleman of the fir&s;t eminence (Mr. Pott) in &s;urgery was &s;ent for from London; who ap|proved of what had been done, and directed the continuation of the &s;ame applications and medicines.</P>
<P>January the 28th. Some faint &s;igns of di|ge&s;tion appeared; but, to cut the hi&s;tory &s;hort, it was not until the 28th of February that the &s;loughs were all &s;eparated. In the mean time my patient was repeatedly brought to the brink of the grave, by a violent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heart-burn.</NOTE> car|dialgia and<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Loo&s;ene&s;s.</NOTE> diarrhoea at fir&s;t, and afterwards by an accumulation of excrement in the<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Straight gut.</NOTE> rec|tum, which I, with great difficulty, unloaded by means of a large marrow-&s;poon.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<P>April the 16th. The &s;ore was healed, and I took my leave; but, July the 1&s;t, Mr. Buc|kle relap&s;ed. On the &s;ide of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bone of the foot which &s;u&s;tains the little toe.</NOTE> metatar&s;al bone of the little toe a bli&s;ter had ari&s;en; which being &s;nipped, it formed an e&s;char as black as ink. At his reque&s;t I applied the fermenting poultice mentioned in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, for he was determined to die rather than &s;ub|mit to the former cour&s;e of medicine.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t the 2d. He was completely cured, without any internal medicine what&s;oever. Mr. Sanxay, of this neighbourhood, paid three vi&s;its during the cure, and faw the progre&s;s of it with admiration.</P>
<P>November the 10th. He relap&s;ed again. A large ve&s;ication aro&s;e on the in&s;ide of the heel, which, being &s;nipped, formed an e&s;char as before. The fermenting poultice was ap|plied. This e&s;char was rather larger than a crown-piece, and almo&s;t as deep as the heel|bone. It was healed, with great difficulty, on the 24th day of October, 1781, when it was firmly cicatri&s;ed without any other application
<PB N="9" REF="10">&s;ave that of daily wa&s;hing the ulcer with tinc|ture of myrrh before the poultice was applied.</P>
<P>Mr. Buckle, from October the 24th, 1781, to the 3d of December, 1782, had no return of his mortification, but received a &s;troke of the pal&s;y on that day, for which, on the 5th, two bli&s;ters were applied to the calves of the legs; they were prevented from mortifying by the timely application of the fermenting poul|tice.</P>
<P>December the 26th. The bli&s;ters were healed; and, on the 10th of January, 1783, this worthy gentleman, after having &s;upport|ed him&s;elf with great fortitude and patience, &s;unk under the di&s;ea&s;e, and, I cannot forbear adding, to the great regret of all tho&s;e who were acquainted with his excellent character.</P>

<PB REF="11">
<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF SOME WORM-CASES, With an INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE frequent in&s;tances I &s;aw of the mo&s;t deplorable effects from worms, both in infants and adults, during my re&s;idence at Charles-Town, in South Carolina, induced me to make many trials of various remedies re|commended to me in that country for their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Worm-de&s;troying.</NOTE> anthelmintic virtues. I had very early op|portunities in life of becoming acquainted with the medicines commonly employed in &s;uch ca&s;es, and had often rea&s;on to lament the
<PB N="12" REF="12">inefficacy of &s;ome of them and the dangerous roughne&s;s of others. The tender age and re|duced &s;tate of tho&s;e who are the greate&s;t mar|tyrs to this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eem evidently to point out the milde&s;t remedies as mo&s;t de&s;irable, whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, the common ob&s;tinacy of the complaints as loudly calls for the mo&s;t powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e, therefore, who have tru&s;ted to rhubarb, Aethiop's mineral, worm-&s;eed, powder of tin, and the expre&s;&s;ed oils, have frequently had the mortification to be &s;pectators of the daily progre&s;s of the di&s;|ea&s;e; and the bolder practitioner, who has &s;coured the &s;tomach and bowels with antimo|nials, mercurials, and the violent dra&s;tic pur|ges, has had but little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the &s;uperior efficacy of <HI>his</HI> medicines, when the o|riginal complaints have been &s;ucceeded by a lingering and fatal hectic.</P>
<P>The remedies, which I hereby recommend to the patronage of the public, are the re&s;ult of ten years experience, during which time I have never known an in&s;tance of their failing; but, efficacious as they are, they operate with the greate&s;t mildne&s;s, and are &s;ubject to no ill
<PB N="13" REF="13">con&s;equences whatever afterwards. They may be taken at any time, requiring not the lea&s;t confinement; on the contrary, gentle ex|erci&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ts the medicine as well as the pa|tient. It is not only in the more <HI>evident</HI> and <HI>marked</HI> worm-ca&s;es that they are of u&s;e; they are equally &s;erviceable in that <HI>&s;low</HI> fever which is &s;o frequent in the metropolis, and which is commonly called the worm-fever, though of|tentimes the patient is cured without the di&s;|charge of actual worms. In &s;hort, in all foul bowels, attended with co&s;tivene&s;s, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and &s;allow countenance, I can mo&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly recommend the&s;e medicines, as they never fail to remove the &s;ymptoms gra|dually, clearing the &s;kin and re&s;toring health.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e medicines may be gi|ven without any ri&s;k from cold, they neverthe|le&s;s require to be altered, and proportioned to the &s;trength, age, habit, and other circum|&s;tances, of the patient; which renders it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be attended both before and during the time of taking them, otherwi&s;e it will not be po&s;&s;ible to ad|mini&s;ter them with any degree of certainty.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14">
<P>I cannot conclude without attempting an a|pology for the intru&s;ion of an <HI>unknown</HI> medi|cine upon the courte&s;y of the public: but, as I cannot at pre&s;ent reveal the &s;ecret, and am perfectly &s;atisfied that, upon trial, its own merits will &s;ufficiently recommend it, I &s;hall only beg leave to add, that no one, who is ac|quainted with the virtues of James's powder, will think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with its u&s;e becau&s;e he is ignorant of the pre|ci&s;e form of the compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;ubjoin a cur&s;ory hi&s;tory of a few ca&s;es, by way of adding weight to what I have advanced above.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE the FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>1781. October 30. A boy, aged about e|leven years, &s;on of Charles Greenfield, a la|bouring man, who &s;upplies the village of Ep|&s;om with water, was attacked with St. Vitus's dance. I gave him a mixture of liquid lauda|num two drachms, a&s;&s;afoetida-tincture four drachms, made into a &s;ix-ounce mixture; of which he took a large &s;poonful at a time, often, without relief.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="15">
<P>November 2. Being of opinion, that worms are the mo&s;t common cau&s;e of convul|&s;ions in young people, I gave him three worm-purges, which brought away &s;everal worms, and he gradually recovered.</P>
<P>1782. May 29. He relap&s;ed, and was cu|red by taking &s;ix do&s;es.</P>
<P>1783. January 20. He relap&s;ed again; for which I made him continue the medicines, once every three days, for twenty-five days.</P>
<P>October 20. He is &s;tronger and heartier than ever; and is at this time perfectly well.</P>
<P>His friends would not permit him to take a few do&s;es while he was well, by way of pre|vention, or, in my opinion, he would not have relap&s;ed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE the SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>1782. June 21. The child of E&s;au Ar|cher, a labouring man, aged between two and three years, was brought to me in &s;trong con|vul&s;ions. I gave her eight do&s;es of the medi|cines. She voided &s;everal worms, and was perfectly cured.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="case study">
<PB N="16" REF="16">
<HEAD>CASE the THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>1782. March 19. The Reverend Mr. Price's cook-maid, a young woman, aged twenty-three, was &s;eized with violent convul|&s;ion-fits, for which, being very<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Full of blood.</NOTE> plethoric, &s;he was bled; and an emetic was pre&s;cribed, with a nervous anodyne draught at bed-time, and a purging mixture to take the next morning.</P>
<P>March the 20th. Continuing almo&s;t in the &s;ame &s;tate, a mixture of liquid laudanum and a&s;&s;afoetida-tincture was pre&s;cribed, without relief.</P>
<P>21&s;t. A purge of jalap and a few grains of prepared mercury were pre&s;cribed; after the operation, the mixture with laudanum and a&s;|&s;afoetida was continued.</P>
<P>22d. A phy&s;ician of eminence was called. He recommended half an ounce of the herb called ladies-mantle, to be divided into eight do&s;es, of which one was to be taken three times a day.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="17">
<P>24th. At times &s;he put on the appearance of being relieved. The flowers of ladies mantle were continued until April the 5th, when &s;he relap&s;ed, and was convul&s;ed as &s;e|verely as at the beginning. An electary, of valerian, Ru&s;&s;ia ca&s;tor, and con&s;erve of ro&s;e|mary, with an infu&s;ion of rue and &s;oot-tinc|ture, in a mixture, after it, was pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>April the 7th. Extremely ill. A perpe|tual bli&s;ter was made between the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>17th. From the 7th to this day never en|tirely free from the convul&s;ions. An ounce of valerian-powder was divided into four do&s;es, one of which was taken every &s;ix hours in four &s;poonfuls of the rue-mixture. In the even|ing of this day, &s;he was &s;o ill as to be &s;carcely able to &s;wallow. A mu&s;k-draught was direct|ed to be taken every eight hours, as it could be got down.</P>
<P>April the 22d. No &s;ucce&s;s having attended the medicines pre&s;cribed, it made the doctor determine to try a no&s;trum; which was two &s;cruples of the lungs of a calf, dried in an o|ven and powdered, twice a day, in three &s;poonfuls of &s;trong rue tea. After taking
<PB N="18" REF="18">the&s;e powders a few days, her complaint put on the appearance of mending, and we hoped for &s;ucce&s;s; when, to our great mortification, on the 7th of May, &s;he was attacked as vio|lently as ever. The bli&s;ter was renewed.</P>
<P>May the 8th. A box of pills, compo&s;ed of wood-&s;oot and bal&s;am of amber, was directed; three or four to be taken three times a day.</P>
<P>May the 12th. The pills were continued; but the doctor de&s;paired of her getting the better of the fits, as they generally la&s;ted four or five hours without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>May the 20th. A quack-medicine was re|commended, which had the appearance of &s;weet &s;pirit of vitriol; one phial was &s;aid to be a cure for all convul&s;ions. She took two phi|als with no apparent &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>June the 6th. The doctor gave her over, declaring it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to live. This being the ca&s;e, I informed her friends of a worm-medicine which I gave with great &s;ucce&s;s, and recommended it to her; to which they con&s;ented. I &s;ent eight do&s;es, one to be taken morning and evening. Before &s;he had taken all, &s;everal worms were voided; and
<PB N="19" REF="19">once more her complaint put on the appear|ance of mending.</P>
<P>May the 11th. The powders were conti|nued; and &s;he di&s;charged an amazing large quantity of worms, knotted. She was much altered for the better.</P>
<P>17th. Her countenance began to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of returning health. The convul&s;ions had entirely left her. Appetite good; &s;trength increa&s;ing; daily voiding worms.</P>
<P>25th. Almo&s;t able to do her bu&s;ine&s;s. Ne|verthele&s;s, as &s;he had voided &s;o large a quan|tity of worms, I continued the medicines once a day by way of &s;ecurity, and left them off in three days.</P>
<P>June the 30th. Perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>July the 2d. I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give her three do&s;es more of the medicines, to &s;e|cure her health.</P>
<P>18th. Gave her three do&s;es for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>
<P>1783. June 18. Gave her three do&s;es by way of prevention.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="20">
<P>October the 30th. She is in good health, and better than &s;he had been for years before.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE the FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>1783. July 20. &mdash; Graham, E&s;q. M. P. reque&s;ted me to &s;ee his &s;on, an infant, aged two years, ill, as I was informed, of a worm|fever. I found his belly very large and &s;wel|led, his countenance &s;allow, a &s;low fever, pul&s;e quick and &s;mall, his mouth full of little ulcers, and co&s;tive. The fir&s;t do&s;e of the worm-medicine gave him a large, foetid, &s;li|my, &s;tool, very loo&s;e, which afforded him great relief.</P>
<P>21&s;t. The medicine was repeated, which gave him another &s;tool. He was much better.</P>
<P>22d. The medicine was repeated again.</P>
<P>26th. The gentleman, who attended, wrote, that the child was recovering fa&s;t, and needed no more of the medicine.</P>

He complained of a fixed pain in the pupils of his eyes, which &s;eemed re|markably dejected; a florid countenance, flu&s;hing often, pain of the right &s;ide and &s;to|mach, a tickling cough; a &s;mall, thready, un|equal, pul&s;e; hectic heats and night-&s;weats. An emetic was admini&s;tered, and the next morning a cooling purge. He was advi&s;ed to eat little fle&s;h; to take butter-milk for break|fa&s;t and &s;upper, or whey, or milk-porridge; and to eat freely of &s;allad and other vegeta|bles.</P>
<P>April the 27th. A bli&s;ter was applied be|tween the &s;houlders, and made perpetual for &s;everal weeks; and, as he grew wor&s;e, he was directed to ab&s;tain from animal food. To &s;horten the hi&s;tory, he continued in this &s;tate until the &s;eventh of Augu&s;t following, when he was advi&s;ed to go and try his native air in Su&s;&s;ex.</P>

<P>September the 9th. He returned much in the &s;ame &s;tate, excepting that the pain was fix|ed in the &s;tomach; con&s;tant and &s;evere, always, after eating ever &s;o little; to u&s;e his own words, it had the feel of &s;omething &s;triking gently again&s;t his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>26th. Daily growing weaker, I recom|mended him to take the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Worm-de&s;troyer.</NOTE> anthelmintic, appre|hending that worms might be the cau&s;e of his complaint.</P>
<P>October the 1&s;t. He had taken eight do&s;es, and voided &s;everal knotted worms of various &s;izes.</P>
<P>16th. From the 26th of September to this day, he took, morning and evening, a do&s;e of the medicine, and every day voided &s;ome worms. His pain in the &s;tomach, cough, hectic heats, &amp;c. have all di&s;appeared, and he is now well.</P>
<P>20th. He voided more worms. On that account, I &s;ent him three more do&s;es of the medicines. He is perfectly well, without any complaint, October the 23d, 1783.</P>
<P>February the 28th, 1785. Remains well.</P>
