<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great Plea&s;ure I &s;ee at la&s;t the Pre&s;ervation of Children become the Care of Men of Sen&s;e: It is certainly a Matter that well de&s;erves their Attention, and, I doubt not, the Publick will &s;oon find the good and great Effects of it, The <HI>Foundling Ho&s;pi|tal</HI> may be of more U&s;e to the World, than was perhaps at fir&s;t imagin'd by the Promoters of it; it will be a Means not only of preventing the Murder of many, but of &s;aving more, by in|troducing a more rea&s;onable and more natural Method of Nur&s;ing. In my Opinion, this Bu&s;ine&s;s has been too long fatally left to the Management of Women, who cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to have proper Knowledge to fit them for &s;uch a Ta&s;k, notwith&s;tanding they look up|on it to be their own Province. What I mean, is a Philo&s;ophic Knowledge of Nature, to be acquired only by learned Ob&s;ervation and Expe|rience, and which therefore the Unlearned mu&s;t be incapable of. They may pre&s;ume upon the Examples and tran&s;mitted Cu&s;toms of their Great Grand-mothers, who were taught by the Phy&s;icians of their unenlighten'd Days; when Phy&s;icians, as appears by late Di&s;coveries, were mi&s;taken in many things; being led away be
<PB N="4" REF="3">hypothetical Rea&s;onings to entertain very wild Conceits, in which they were greatly bewilder'd them&s;elves, and mi&s;led others to believe, I know not what &s;trange unaccountable Powers in cer|tain Herbs, Roots, and Drugs; and al&s;o in &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Practices and Ceremonies; for all which Notions, there being no real Foundation in Nature, they ought to be looked upon as the Effects of Ignorance, or the Arti|fices of de&s;igning Quacks; who found their Ac|count, by pretending to great Knowledge in the&s;e occult Qualities, and impo&s;ing upon the Credulous. The Art of Phy&s;ick has been much improv'd within this la&s;t Century; by ob&s;erving and following Nature more clo&s;ely, many u&s;e|ful Di&s;coveries have been made, which help us to account for Things in a natural Way, that before &s;eem'd my&s;terious and magical; and which have con&s;equently made the Practice of it more conformable to Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e. This being the Ca&s;e, there is great room to fear, that tho&s;e Nur&s;es who yet retain many of the&s;e traditional Prejudices, are capitally mi|&s;taken in their Management of Children in general and, fancying that Nature has left a great deal to their Skill and Contrivance, often do much harm, where they intend to do good. Of this I &s;hall endeavour to convince them, by &s;hewing, how I think Children may be cloath'd, fed, and managed with much le&s;s Trouble to their Nur&s;es, and infinitely greater Ea&s;e and Comfort to the little ones.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>THE Foundlings under the Care of the Ho|&s;pital, I pre&s;ume, will be bred in a very plain, &s;imple Manner: They will therefore infallibly have the more Health, Beauty, Strength, and Spirits; I might add Under&s;tanding too, as all the Faculties of the Mind are well known to depend upon the Organs of the Body; &s;o that when the&s;e are in good Order, the thinking Part is mo&s;t alert and active; the contrary, when they are di&s;turbed or di&s;ea&s;ed. When the&s;e Advantages appear in Favour of Children &s;o brought up, as I am confident in time they will, it may &s;erve to convince mo&s;t Nur&s;es, Aunts, Grand-mothers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how much they have hitherto been in the wrong, what Mi&s;|chief is done to Children, and what Multitudes are de&s;troyed or &s;poiled, as well by cramming them with Cakes, Sweetmeats, &amp;c. till they foul their Blood, choak their Ve&s;&s;els, pall the Appetite, and ruin every Faculty of their Bo|dies; as by cockering and indulging them, to the utter Perver&s;ion of their naturally good Temper, till they become quite froward and indocile.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man takes upon him to contradict received Opinions and Prejudices &s;anctified by Time, it is expected he &s;hould bring valid Proof of what he advances. The Truth of what I &s;ay, that the Treatment of Children in general is wrong, unrea&s;onable and unnatural, will in great mea&s;ure appear, if we but con&s;ider what a puny valetudinary Race mo&s;t of our People of Condition are; chiefly owing to bad
<PB N="6" REF="5">Nur&s;ing, and bad Habits contracted early. But let any one, who would be fully convinced of this Matter, look over the Bills of Mortality; there he may ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t Half the Number of tho&s;e, who fill up that black Li&s;t, die under five Years of Age: So that Half the People that come into the World, go out of it again before they become of the lea&s;t U&s;e to it, or them&s;elves. To me, this &s;eems to de&s;erve &s;erious Con&s;ideration; and yet I cannot find, that any one Man of Sen&s;e, and publick Spirit, has ever attended to it at all; notwith&s;tanding the Maxim in every one's Mouth, that a Mul|titude of Inhabitants is the greate&s;t Strength and be&s;t Support of a Commonwealth. The Mi&s;conduct, to which I mu&s;t impute a great Part of the Calamity, is too common and obvi|ous to engage the Idle and Speculative, who are to be caught only by very refined Re&s;earches; and the bu&s;y Part of Mankind, where their immediate Intere&s;t is not concerned, will al|ways overlook what they &s;ee daily: It may be thought a natural Evil, and &s;o is &s;ubmitted to without Examination. But this is by no means the Ca&s;e; and where it is entirely owing to Mi&s;management, and po&s;&s;ibly may admit of a Remedy, it is ridiculous to charge it upon Na|ture, and &s;uppo&s;e, that Infants are more &s;ub|ject to Di&s;ea&s;e and Death than grown Per&s;ons; on the contrary, they bear Pain and Di&s;ea&s;e much better, Fevers e&s;pecially, (as is plain in the Ca&s;e of the Small-Pox, generally mo&s;t fa|vourable to Children) and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on
<PB N="7" REF="6">that a Twig is le&s;s hurt by a Storm than an Oak. In all the other Productions of Nature we &s;ee the greate&s;t Vigor and Luxuriancy of Health, the nearer they are to the Egg or the Bud: They are indeed then mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of Injury, and it is Injury only that de&s;troys them. When was there a Lamb, a Bird, or a Tree that died becau&s;e it was young? The&s;e are under the immediate Nur&s;ing of unerring Nature, and they thrive accordingly. Ought it not there|fore to be the Care of every Nur&s;e and every Parent, not only to protect their Nur&s;elings from Injury, but to be well a&s;&s;ured that their own officious Services be not the greate&s;t the helple&s;s Creatures can &s;uffer?</P>
<P>IN the lower Cla&s;s of Mankind, e&s;pecially in the Country, Di&s;ea&s;e and Mortality are not &s;o frequent, either among the Adult, or their Children. Health and Po&s;terity are the Portion of the Poor, I mean the laborious: The Want of Superfluity confines them more within the Limits of Nature: Hence they enjoy Ble&s;&s;ings they feel not, and are ignorant of their Cau&s;e. The Mother who has only a few Rags to cover her Child loo&s;ely, and little more than her own Brea&s;t to feed it, &s;ees it healthy and &s;trong, and very &s;oon able to &s;hift for it&s;elf; while the puny Infect, the Heir and Hope of a rich Fa|mily lies langu&s;hing under a Load of Finery, that overpowers his Limbs, abhorring and rejecting the Dainties he is crammed with, till he dies a Victim to the mi&s;taken Care and Tenderne&s;s of his fond Mother. In the Cour&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="7">of my Practice I have had frequent occa&s;ion to be fully &s;atisfied of this, and have often heard a Mother anxiou&s;ly &s;ay <HI>the Child has not been well ever &s;ince it has done puking and crying.</HI> The&s;e Complaints, tho' not attended to, point very plainly to their Cau&s;e. Is it not very evident, that when a Child rids its Stomach &s;everal times in a Day, that it has been over-loaded? when it cries, from the Incumbrance and Con|finement of its Cloaths, that it is hurt by them? While the natural Strength la&s;ts (as every Child is born with more Health and Strength than is generally imagined) it cries at, or rejects the &s;uperfluous Load, and thrives apace: that is, grows very fat, bloted, and di&s;tended beyond mea&s;ure; like a Hou&s;e-Lamb. But in Time, the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ive Cau&s;e continuing, the na|tural Powers are overcome, being no longer able to throw off the unequal Weight; the Child, now not able to cry any more, lan|gui&s;hes and is quiet. The Misfortune is, the&s;e Complaints are not under&s;tood; it is &s;wadled and cramm'd on, 'till after Gripes, Purging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it &s;inks under both Burdens into a Convul&s;ion Fit, and e&s;capes any further Torture. This would be the Ca&s;e with the Lamb, was it not killed when it is full fat.</P>
<P>THAT the pre&s;ent Method of Nur&s;ing is wrong, one would think needed no other Proof than the frequent Mi&s;carriages attending it, the Death of Many, and ill Health of Tho&s;e that &s;urvive. But the per&s;uading you of it may be a needle&s;s Ta&s;k; if you have ever thought about
<PB N="9" REF="8">it, I doubt not but you are already convinced it is &s;o. However, &s;ince you de&s;ire my Sentiments upon the Subject, taking it for granted you think with me, that mo&s;t of our Nur&s;es are got into a wrong Method, I will endeavour, in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible, to tell you what I think a right one.</P>
<P>YOU perceive, Sir, by the Hints I have al|ready dropp'd, what I am going to complain of is, that Children in general are over-cloath'd and over-fed, and fed and cloath'd improperly. To the&s;e Cau&s;es I impute almo&s;t all their Di&s;ea&s;es. But to be a little more explicit. The fir&s;t great Mi&s;take is, that they think a new-born Infant cannot be kept too warm; from this Prejudice they load and bind it with Flannels, Wrap|pers, Swaths, Stays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> commonly called Cloaths; which all together are almo&s;t equal to its own Weight; by which means a healthy Child in a Month's Time is made &s;o tender and chilly, it cannot bear the external Air; and if, by any Accident of a Door or Window left carele&s;sly open too long, a refre&s;hing Breeze be admitted into the &s;uffocating Atmo&s;phere of the Lying-in Bed-chamber, the Child and Mo|ther &s;ometimes catch irrecoverable Colds. But what is wor&s;e than this, at the End of the Month, if things go on apparently well, this Hot-bed Plant is &s;ent out into the Country, to be rear'd in a leaky Hou&s;e, that lets in Wind and Rain from every Quarter. Is it any Won|der the Child never thrives afterwards? The Truth is, a new-born Child cannot well be too
<PB N="10" REF="9">cool and loo&s;e in its Dre&s;s; it wants le&s;s Cloath|ing than a grown Per&s;on, in proportion; be|cau&s;e it is naturally warmer, as appears by the Thermometer; and would therefore bear the Cold of a Winter's Night, much better than any adult Per&s;on whatever. There are many In&s;tances both ancient and modern of Infants expo&s;ed and de&s;erted, that have lived &s;everal Days. As it was the Practice of ancient Times, in many Parts of the World, to expo&s;e all tho&s;e, whom the Parents did not care to be encum|ber'd with; that were deformed or born under evil Stars: not to mention the many Found|lings pick'd up in <HI>London</HI> Streets. The&s;e In|&s;tances may &s;erve to &s;hew, that Nature has made Children able to bear even great Hard|&s;hips, before they are made weak and &s;ickly by their mi&s;taken Nur&s;es. But be&s;ides the Mi&s;|chief ari&s;ing from the Weight and Heat of the&s;e Swaddling-cloaths, they are put on &s;o tight, and the Child is &s;o cramp'd by them, that its Bowels have not Room, nor the Limbs any Liberty, to act and exert them&s;elves in the free ea&s;y manner they ought. This is a very hurtful Circum&s;tance, for Limbs that are not u&s;ed, will never be &s;trong, and &s;uch tender Bo|dies cannot bear much Pre&s;&s;ure: The Circu|lation re&s;trained by the Compre&s;&s;ion of any one Part, mu&s;t produce unnatural Swellings in &s;ome other; e&s;pecially as the Fibres of Infants are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tended. To which doubtle&s;s are owing the many Di&s;tortions and Defor|mities we meet with every where; chiefly
<PB N="11" REF="10">among Women, who &s;uffer more in this Par|ticular than the Men. I would recommend the following Dre&s;s: A little Flannel Wai&s;tcoat without Sleeves, made to fit the Body, and tie loo&s;ely behind; to which there &s;hould be a Petticoat &s;ew'd, and over this a kind of Gown of the &s;ame Material, or any other that is light, thin and flim&s;y. The Petticoat &s;hould not be quite &s;o long as the Child, the Gown a few Inches longer; with one Cap only on the Head, which may be made double, if it be thought not warm enough. What I mean is, that the whole Coiffure &s;hould be &s;o contrived, that it might be put on at once, and neither bind nor pre&s;s the Head at all: The Linnen as u&s;ual. This, I think would be abundantly &s;uf|ficient for the Day; laying a&s;ide all tho&s;e Swathes, Bandages, Stays, and Contrivances, that are mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly u&s;ed to clo&s;e and keep the Head in its Place, and &s;upport the Body. As if Nature, exact Nature, had produced her chief Work, a human Creature, &s;o carele&s;sly unfini&s;h'd, as to want tho&s;e idle Aids to make it perfect. Shoes and Stockings are very need|le&s;s Incumbrances, be&s;ides that they keep the Legs wet and na&s;ty, if they are not changed every Hour, and often cramp and hurt the Feet: A Child would &s;tand firmer, and learn to walk much &s;ooner without them. I think they cannot be nece&s;&s;ary 'till it runs out in the Dirt. There &s;hould be a thin Flannel Shirt for the Night, which ought to be every way quite loo&s;e. Children in this &s;imple, plea&s;ant Dre&s;s,
<PB N="12" REF="11">which may be readily put on and off without teazing them, would find them&s;elves perfectly ea&s;y and happy, enjoying the free U&s;e of their Limbs and Faculties, which they would very &s;oon begin to employ, when they are thus left at Liberty. I would have them put into it as &s;oon as they are born, and continued in it, till they are three Years old; when it may be changed for any other more genteel and fa&s;hio|nable: tho' I could wi&s;h it was not the Cu&s;tom to wear Stays at all; not becau&s;e I &s;ee no Beauty in the Sugarloaf Shape, but that I am apprehen&s;ive, it is often procur'd at the Ex|pence of the Health and Strength of the Body. There is an odd Notion enough entertained about Change, and the keeping of Children clean. Some imagine that clean Linnen and fre&s;h Cloaths draw, and rob them of their nouri&s;hing Juices. I cannot &s;ee that they do any thing more than imbibe a little of that Moi&s;ture which their Bodies exhale. Were it as is &s;uppo&s;ed, it would be of Service to them; &s;ince they are always too abundantly &s;upplied, and therefore I think they cannot be changed too often, and would have them clean every Day; as it would free them from Stinks and Sourne&s;&s;es, which are not only offen&s;ive, but very prejudicial to the tender State of Infancy.</P>
<P>THE Feeding of Children properly is of much greater Importance to them than their Cloathing. We ought to take great Care to be right in this material Article, and that nothing be given them, but what is whole&s;ome and
<PB N="13" REF="12">good for them, and in &s;uch Quantity, as the Body calls for towards its Support and Growth; not a Grain more. Let us con&s;ider what Na|ture directs in the Ca&s;e: If we follow Nature, in&s;tead of leading or driving it, we cannot err. In the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Nur&s;ing, as well as Phy&s;ick, Art is ever de&s;tructive, if it does not exactly copy this Original. When a Child is fir&s;t born, there &s;eems to be no Provi&s;ion at all made for it; for the Mother's Milk &s;eldom comes till the third Day; &s;o that according to Nature, a Child would be left a Day and a half, or two Days, without any Food; to me a very &s;uffi|cient Proof that it wants none: It is born full of Blood, full of Excrements, its Appetites not awake, nor its Sen&s;es opened; and requires this intermediate Time of Ab&s;tinence and Re&s;t, to compo&s;e and recover the Struggle of the Birth, and the Change of Circulation, (the Blood run|ning into new Channels,) which always put it into a little Fever. However extraordinary this may appear, I am &s;ure it is better it were not fed at all; for it &s;leeps almo&s;t the whole Time, and when the Milk is ready for it, would be hungry, and &s;uck with more Eagerne&s;s; which is often nece&s;&s;ary, for it &s;eldom comes freely at fir&s;t. At lea&s;t I would prevail thus far, that the Child be not awaked out of its Sleep to be fed, as is commonly done. This is the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Nature, which is very little attended to, and never followed. The general Practice is, as &s;oon as a Child is born, to cram a Dab of Butter and Sugar down its
<PB N="14" REF="13">Throat, a little Oil, Panada, Caudle, or &s;ome &s;uch unwhol&s;ome Me&s;s. So that they &s;et out wrong, and the Child &s;tands a fair Chance of being made &s;ick from the fir&s;t Hour. It is the Cu&s;tom of &s;ome to give a little roa&s;t Pig to an Infant; which it &s;eems, is to cure it of all the Mother's Longings. I wi&s;h the&s;e Matters were a little more enquired into, for the Honour of the Sex; to which many Imperfections of this kind are imputed, which I am &s;ure it does not lie under. When a Child &s;ucks its own Mo|ther, which, with a very few Exceptions, would be be&s;t for every Child, and every Mo|ther, Nature has provided it with &s;uch whol|&s;ome and &s;uitable Nouri&s;hment; &s;uppo&s;ing her a temperate Woman, that makes &s;ome U&s;e of her Limbs; it can hardly do ami&s;s. The Mo|ther would likewi&s;e, in mo&s;t hy&s;terical, ner|vous Ca&s;es, e&s;tabli&s;h her own Health by it, tho' &s;he were weak and &s;ickly before, as well as that of her Offspring. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h, that every Woman that is able, who&s;e Fountains are not greatly di&s;turbed or tainted, would give Suck to her Child. I am very &s;ure that forcing back the Milk, which mo&s;t young Women mu&s;t have in great abundance, may be of fatal Con&s;equence: Sometimes it endangers Life, and often lays the Foundation of many incurable Di&s;ea&s;es. The Rea&s;ons that are given for this Practice are very frivolous, and drawn from fal&s;e Premi&s;es; that &s;ome Women are too weak to bear &s;uch a Drain, which would rob them of their own Nouri&s;hment. This is a
<PB N="15" REF="14">very mi&s;taken Notion; for the fir&s;t general Cau&s;e of mo&s;t People's Di&s;ea&s;es is, not Want of Nouri&s;hment, as is here imagined, but too great a Fulne&s;s and Redundancy of Humours; good at fir&s;t, but being more than the Body can employ or con&s;ume, the whole Ma&s;s becomes corrupt, and produces many Di&s;ea&s;es. This is confirmed by the general Practice of Phy&s;icians, who make holes in the Skin, perpetual Bli&s;ters, I&s;&s;ues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to let out the Superfluity. I would therefore leave it to be con&s;ider'd, whether the throwing back &s;uch a Load of Humour, as a Woman's fir&s;t Milk, be mo&s;t likely to mend her Con&s;titution, or make her Complaints irre|mediable. The Mother's fir&s;t Milk is purga|tive, and clean&s;es the Child of its long hoarded Excrement; no Child therefore can be deprived of it without manife&s;t Injury. By degrees it changes its Property, becomes le&s;s purgative, and more nouri&s;hing; and is the be&s;t and only Food the Child likes, or ought to have for &s;ome time. If I could prevail, no Child &s;hould ever be cramm'd with any unnatural Mixture, 'till the Provi&s;ion of Nature was ready for it; nor afterwards fed with any ungenial alien Diet whatever, the <HI>fir&s;t three Months:</HI> for it is not well able to dige&s;t and a&s;&s;imilate other Aliments &s;ooner. There is u&s;ually Milk enough with the fir&s;t Child; &s;ometimes more than it can take: It is poured forth from an exuberant, overflowing Urn, by a bountiful Hand, that never provides &s;paringly. The Call of Nature &s;hould be waited for to feed it with any thing
<PB N="16" REF="15">more &s;ub&s;tantial, and the Appetite ever precede the Food; not only with regard to the daily Meals, but tho&s;e Changes of Diet, which open|ing, increa&s;ing Life requires. But this is never done in either Ca&s;e, which is one of the great|e&s;t Mi&s;takes of all Nur&s;es. Thus far Nature, if &s;he be not interrupted, will do the whole Bu&s;i|ne&s;s perfectly well; and there &s;eems to be no|thing left for a Nur&s;e to do, but to keep the Child clean and &s;weet, and to tumble and to&s;s it about a good deal, play with it, and keep it in good Humour.</P>
<P>BUT now the Child (I mean when it is about three Months old) requires more &s;olid Su&s;tenance, we are to enquire what, and how much, is mo&s;t proper to give it. We may be well a&s;&s;ured, there is a great Mi&s;take either in the Quantity or Quality of Childrens Food, or both, as it is u&s;ually given them; becau&s;e they are made &s;ick by it. As to Quantity, there is a mo&s;t ridiculous Error in the common Practice; for it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that whenever a Child cries, it wants Victuals; and it is accord|ly fed, ten, twelve, or more times in a Day and Night. This is &s;o obvious a Mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion, that I am &s;urprized it &s;hould ever prevail. If a Child's Wants and Motions be diligently and judiciou&s;ly attended to, it will be found that it never cries but from Pain: Now the fir&s;t Sen&s;ations of Hunger are not attended with Pain; accordingly a Child (I mean this of a very young one) that is hungry, will make a hundred other Signs of its Want, before it will
<PB N="17" REF="16">cry for Food. If it be healthy and quite ea&s;y in its Dre&s;s, it will hardly ever cry at all. In|deed the&s;e Signs and Motions, I &s;peak of, are but rarely to be ob&s;erved; becau&s;e it &s;eldom happens that Children are ever &s;uffered to be hungry. In a few, very few, whom I have had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee rea&s;onably nur&s;ed, that were not fed above two or three times in four and twenty Hours, and yet were perfectly healthy, active and happy; I have &s;een the&s;e Signals, which were as intelligible as if they had &s;poke.</P>
<P>THERE are many Faults in the Quality of their Food; It is not &s;imple enough. Their Paps, Panada's, Gruels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are generally en|riched with Sugar, Spice, and &s;ometimes a Drop of Wine; neither of which they ought ever to ta&s;te. Our Bodies never want them: they are what Luxury only has introduced, to the De|&s;truction of the Health of Mankind. It is not enough that their Food be &s;imple, it &s;hould be al&s;o light. Several People, I find, are mi&s;ta|ken in their Notions of what is light; and fan|cy that mo&s;t kinds of Pa&s;try, Puddings, Cu&s;tards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are light, that is, light of Di|ge&s;tion. But there is nothing heavier in this Sen&s;e than unfermented Flour and Eggs boil'd hard, which are the chief Ingredients of tho&s;e Preparations. What I mean by light, to give the be&s;t Idea I can of it, is any Sub&s;tance that is ea&s;ily &s;eparated, and &s;oluble in warm Water. Good Bread is the lighte&s;t thing I know; the Power of due Fermentation, in which con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="18" REF="17">the whole Art of making it, breaks and attenu|ates the tenacious Particles of the Flour, &s;o as to give it the&s;e Qualities I mention, and make it the fitte&s;t Food for young Children. Cows Milk is al&s;o &s;imple and light, and very good for them; but it is injudiciou&s;ly prepared: it &s;hould not be boiled, for boiling alters the Ta&s;te and Property of it, de&s;troys its Sweetne&s;s, and makes it thicker, heavier, and le&s;s fit to mix and a&s;&s;imilate with the Blood. But the chief Objection is, that their Food is wholly vege|table; the bad Con&s;equence of which is, that it will turn &s;our in their Stomachs. The fir&s;t and general Cau&s;e of all the Di&s;ea&s;es of Infants, is manife&s;tly this ace&s;cent Quality of all their Food. If any of the&s;e vegetable Preparations I have named, be kept in a Degree of Heat equal to that of a Child's Stomach it will be|come &s;our as Vinegar in a few Hours time. The&s;e Things are therefore very improper to feed a Child wholly with. Some Part of its Diet &s;hould be contrived to have a contrary Tendency; &s;uch as we find only in Fle&s;h, which is the direct oppo&s;ite to Acid, and tends to Putrefaction. In a due Mixture of the&s;e two Extremes, correcting each other, con&s;i&s;ts that Salubrity of Aliment our Nature &s;eems to require. As we are partly carniverous Animals, a Child ought not to be fed wholly upon Ve|getables. The Mother's Milk, when it is per|fectly good, &s;eems to be this true Mixture of the animal and vegetable Properties, that agrees be&s;t with the Con&s;titution of a Child; readily
<PB N="19" REF="18">pa&s;&s;es into good Blood, requiring but a gentle Exertion of the Powers of Circulation to break and &s;ubdue its Particles and make them &s;mooth and round, and ea&s;ily divi&s;ible. I would advi&s;e therefore, that one half of Infants Diet be thin light Broths, with a little Bread or Rice boiled in them; which la&s;t is not &s;o a&s;ce&s;cent as any other kind of Meal or Flour. The&s;e Broths &s;hould be made with the Fle&s;h of full grown Animals, becau&s;e their Juices are more ela|borate; e&s;pecially if they had never been con|fined to be fatted. The Juices of a young Ox, taken from the Plough, make the fine&s;t fla|vour'd and mo&s;t whol&s;ome Soup. I believe it is for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the Fle&s;h of all wild Animals has a lighter Ta&s;te than that of tame, &s;aginated ones; and is therefore mo&s;t agreeable to the Palates of the Luxurious; but this is to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e Creatures that feed on Corn or Herbage. The other Part of Childrens Diet may be a little Bread and Water boiled al|mo&s;t dry, and then mixed with fre&s;h Milk, not boiled. This, without Sugar, Spice, or any other pretended Amendment whatever, would be perfectly light and whol&s;ome, of &s;ufficient Nouri&s;hment, &s;omething like Milk from the Cow, with the additional Strength and Spirit of Bread in it. Twice a Day, and not oftener, a &s;ucking Child &s;hould be fed at fir&s;t; once with the Broth, and once with the Milk thus pre|pared. As to the Quantity at each Time, its Appetite mu&s;t be the Mea&s;ure of that; its
<PB N="20" REF="19">Hunger &s;hould be &s;atisfied, but no more; for Children will always eat with &s;ome Eagerne&s;s full as much as they ought: Therefore it mu&s;t be very wrong to go beyond that, and &s;tuff them till they &s;pue, as the common Method is. They &s;hould not be laid on their Backs to be fed, but held in a &s;itting Po&s;ture, that &s;wal|lowing may be ea&s;ier to them, and that they may the more readily di&s;cover when they have had enough. When they come to be about <HI>&s;ix Months</HI> old, and their Appetite and Dige&s;tion grows &s;trong, they may be fed three times a Day; which I think they ought never to ex|ceed their whole Lives after. By Night I would not have them fed or &s;uckled at all, that they might at lea&s;t be hungry in the Morn|ing. It is this Night-feeding that makes them &s;o over-fat and bloated. If they be not u&s;ed to it at fir&s;t, and perhaps awaked on purpo&s;e, they will never &s;eek it; and if they are not di|&s;turbed from the Birth, in a Week's time they will get into a Habit of &s;leeping all, or mo&s;t part of the Night very quietly; awaking po&s;|&s;ibly once or twice for a few Minutes, when they are wet and ought to be changed. If it be thought nece&s;&s;ary to give them any thing between Meals, a little Milk and Water is be&s;t. Their Meals, and in my Opinion their &s;ucking too, ought to be at &s;tated Times, and the &s;ame every Day; that the Stomach may have Inter|vals to dige&s;t, and the Appetite return. The Child would &s;oon be quite ea&s;y and &s;atisfied in
<PB N="21" REF="20">the Habit; much more &s;o, than when taught to expect Food at all times, and at every little Fit of Crying and Unea&s;ine&s;s. Let this Method be ob&s;erved about a <HI>Twelvemonth,</HI> when, and not before, they may be weaned; not all at once, but by in&s;en&s;ible Degrees; that they may neither feel, nor fret at the want of the Brea&s;t. This might be very ea&s;ily manag'd, if they were &s;uffer'd to &s;uck only at certain Times. If this Plan of Nur&s;ing were literally pur&s;ued, the Children kept clean and &s;weet, tumbled and to&s;s'd about a good deal, and carried out every Day in all Weathers; I am confident, that in &s;ix or eight Months time mo&s;t Children would become healthy and &s;trong, would be able to fit up on the Ground without Support, to divert them&s;elves an Hour at a time, to the great Relief of their Nur&s;es, would readily find the u&s;e of their Legs, and very &s;oon &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked whether I mean this of Chil|dren in general, and that weakly Ones born of unhealthy Parents &s;hould be treated in the &s;ame Manner; I an&s;wer, that it is not &s;o common for Children to inherit the Di&s;ea&s;es of their Pa|rents, as is generally imagined; there is much vulgar Error in this Opinion; for People that are very unhealthy &s;eldom have Children, e&s;pe|cially if the bad Health be of the female Side; and it is generally late in Life when chronick Di&s;ea&s;es take place in mo&s;t Men, when the Bu|&s;ine&s;s of Love is pretty well over: Certainly
<PB N="22" REF="21">Children can have no Title to tho&s;e Infirmities, which their Parents have acquired by Indolence and Intemperance long after their Birth. It is not common for People to complain of Ails they think hereditary, till they are grown up; that is, till they have contributed to them by their own Irregularities and Exce&s;&s;es, and then are glad to throw their own Faults back upon their Parents; and lament a bad Con&s;titution, when they have &s;poiled a very good one. It is very &s;eldom that young Children are troubled with Family Di&s;tempers: Indeed, when we find them affected with &s;crophulous, venereal, or high &s;corbutick Complaints, we may rea&s;on|ably conclude the Taint to have been tra&s;mit|ted to them; but the&s;e Ca&s;es are very rare, in Compari&s;on of the many others that are fal&s;ly, and without the lea&s;t Foundation, imputed to Parents, when the real Cau&s;e is either in the Complainants them&s;elves, or bad Nur&s;ing, that has fixed them early in wrong Habits. In one Sen&s;e many Di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;aid to be heredita|ry, perhaps all tho&s;e of male Formation; by which I mean not only Deformity and Di&s;tor|tion, but all tho&s;e Ca&s;es where the Fibres and Ve&s;&s;els of one Part are weaker in Proportion than the re&s;t; &s;o that upon any Strain of the Body, whether of Debauch or too violent Ex|erci&s;e, the weak Part fails fir&s;t, and di&s;orders the whole. Thus Complaints may be produ|ced &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Parent, owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the Similitude of Parts, which
<PB N="23" REF="22">po&s;&s;ibly is inherited, like the Features of the Face; but yet the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es might never have appeared, but for the immediate acting Cau&s;e, the Violence done to the Body. Mo&s;t Di&s;tem|pers have two Cau&s;es; the one, a particular State of the Solids and Fluids of the Body, which di&s;po&s;e it to receive certain Infections and Impul&s;es; the other, the Infection or Impul&s;e it&s;elf. Now what I contend for is, that tho' this predi&s;ponent State or Habit of the Body be heritable, yet the Di&s;ea&s;es incident to the&s;e wretched Heirs may be avoided, by preventing the active Cau&s;e; which may be done in many Ca&s;es by a due Attention to the Non-naturals, as they are called; in plainer Words, by a re|gular, temperate Life: in Children, by good Nur&s;ing. Therefore I conclude, that in&s;tead of indulging and enfeebling yet more, by the common Methods, Children &s;o unhappily born; that which I am recommending, together with the whol&s;ome Milk of a healthy Nur&s;e, is the be&s;t, the only Means to remedy the Evil, and by which alone they may by degrees be made healthy and &s;trong. And thus, in a Genera|tion or two of rea&s;onable, temperate Per&s;ons, every Taint and Infirmity whatever, the King's Evil, and Madne&s;s not excepted, would be to|tally wore out.</P>
<P>THE plain natural Plan I have laid down, is never followed; becau&s;e mo&s;t Mothers, of any Condition, either cannot, or will not undertake the trouble&s;ome Ta&s;k of &s;uckling their own
<PB N="24" REF="23">Children; which is trouble&s;ome only for want of proper Method; were it rightly managed, there would be much Plea&s;ure in it, to every Woman that can prevail upon her&s;elf to give up a little of the Beauty of her Brea&s;t to feed her Offspring. There would be no fear of of|fending the Hu&s;band's Ears with the Noi&s;e of the &s;qualling Brat. The Child, was it nurs'd in this Way, would be always quiet, in good Humour, ever playing, laughing, or &s;leeping. In my Opinion, a Man of Sen&s;e cannot have a prettier Rattle (for Rattles he mu&s;t have of one kind or other) than &s;uch a young Child. I am quite at a lo&s;s to account for the general Practice of &s;ending Infants out of Doors, to be &s;uckled, or dry-nur&s;ed by another Woman, who has not &s;o much Under&s;tanding, nor can have &s;o much Affection for it, as the Parents; and how it comes to pa&s;s, that People of good Sen&s;e and ea&s;y Circum&s;tances will not give them&s;elves the Pains to watch over the Health and Welfare of their Children; that po&s;&s;ibly would take much more with a Shrub or a Flower; e&s;pe|cially as the Love of Po&s;terity is &s;o natural to Mankind. I would earne&s;tly recommend it to every Father to have his Child nur&s;ed under his own Eye, to make u&s;e of his own Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e in &s;uperintending and directing the Management of it; nor &s;uffer it to be made one of the My&s;teries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> from which the Men are to be excluded. I would advi&s;e every Mother that can, for her own &s;ake,
<PB N="25" REF="24">as well as her Child's, to &s;uckle it. If &s;he be a healthy Woman, it will confirm her Health; if weakly, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es it will re&s;tore her. It need be no Confinement to her, or Abridgment of her Time: Four times in four and twenty Hours will be often enough to give it Suck; letting it have as much as it will take, out of both Brea&s;ts, at each time. It may be fed and dre&s;s'd by &s;ome handy, rea&s;onable Servant, that will &s;ubmit to be directed; whom likewi&s;e it may &s;leep with. No other Woman's Milk can be &s;o good for her Child; and dry-nur&s;ing I look upon to be the mo&s;t unnatural and dangerous Method of all; and, according to my Ob&s;erva|tion, not one in three &s;urvives it. To breed a Child in this artificial Manner, requires more Knowledge of Nature, and the animal Oecono|my, than the be&s;t Nur&s;e was ever Mi&s;tre&s;s of, as well as more Care and Attention than is ge|nerally be&s;tow'd on Children: the Skill of a good Phy&s;ician would be nece&s;&s;ary to manage it rightly. I am very glad this is not the Method of the Ho&s;pital: I believe there is not the lea&s;t Colour of Objection to any Part of the Manage|ment of that mo&s;t u&s;eful and excellent Charity, as far as it depends upon the Directors of it. Sending the Children out to Country Nur&s;es, under the Care of In&s;pectors, is undoubtedly the be&s;t Method they could take; but how far the&s;e Nur&s;es and their In&s;pectors (who, I &s;up|po&s;e, are to be &s;ome good Gentlewomen in the Neighbourhood) may be per&s;uaded out of their
<PB N="26" REF="25">old Forms, to treat their Nur&s;elings a little more rea&s;onably, is matter of much Doubt. I fear they will be too tenacious of their Prejudi|ces, as well as opinionated of their Skill, to be ea&s;ily convinced they are in the wrong; and who &s;hall undertake the Ta&s;k? However, I de&s;pair not of &s;eeing a Reformation one Day or other; and to contribute to it as much as lies in my Power, I will give you my Opinion as to the Precautions, nece&s;&s;ary to be taken, in the Choice of the&s;e Nur&s;es; and likewi&s;e a few Rea&s;ons why the Children, entru&s;ted to their Care, &s;hould be treated &s;omewhat differently from tho&s;e, who are nur&s;ed in a more natural Way, and &s;uck their own Mothers. I make no doubt, but great Care is taken, that the Nur&s;es, recommended to the Ho&s;pital, be clean and healthy Women. But this is not enough, the Preference &s;hould be given to the middle-aged; becau&s;e they will have more Milk than the very young, and more and better than the old. This is a material Con&s;ideration, as, I &s;uppo&s;e, they have each her own Child to &s;uckle be&s;ides. Tho&s;e between twenty and thirty are certainly of the be&s;t Age. But what I think of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence is, that great Regard &s;hould be had to the Time of their Lying-in, and tho&s;e procured, if po&s;&s;ible, who have not been brought to-bed above two or three Months. The Rea&s;on of this is, that Nature intending a Child &s;hould &s;uck about a Twelvemonth, the Milk &s;eldom continues good much longer.
<PB N="27" REF="26">About that Time, Women in general, though they give Suck, are apt to breed again; &s;ome indeed, that are very &s;anguine, will breed &s;ooner: the&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their Milk, are apt to be troubled with the <HI>Catamenia,</HI> which di&s;turb it greatly; and therefore are not &s;o pro|per to be made Nur&s;es of. But, whether they breed or not, it is my Opinion, that after a Year's Time, or thereabouts, however it may agree with a Child that has &s;ucked it from the fir&s;t, their Milk will become &s;tale and vapid, at lea&s;t very unfit for a new-born Infant; that if it be deprived of its own Mother's Milk, ought undoubtedly to have what is mo&s;t like it: the newer it is, the more &s;uitable in all re&s;pects to its tender Nature. Yet it is a common thing for a Woman to &s;uckle two or three Chil|dren &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with the &s;ame Milk.</P>
<P>A NURSE ought to have great Regard to her Diet: It is not enough that &s;he be &s;ober and temperate, her Food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of a proper Mixture of Fle&s;h and Vegetables: She &s;hould eat one hearty Meal of Fle&s;h-meat every Day, with a good deal of Garden Stuff, and Bread. Thin Broth or Milk would be be&s;t for her Breakfa&s;t and Supper. Her Drink &s;hould be &s;mall Beer, or Milk and Water; but upon no Account &s;hould &s;he ever touch a drop of Wine or &s;trong Drink, much le&s;s any kind of &s;piri|tuous Liquors: Giving Ale or Brandy to a Nur&s;e is, in effect, giving it the Child; and it is ea&s;y to conclude what would be the Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<P>THE Children likewi&s;e, thus &s;ent out, re|quire a particular Treatment. The Plan I would lay down, could I prevail, &s;hould be that of Nature, excluding Art and foreign Aid entirely. But when this is broke in upon, a little adventitious Skill becomes indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary; that if we are not perfectly right in following clo&s;ely the De&s;ign of Nature, we may co-operate a little, and not be totally wrong in counter-acting it, as is too often the Ca&s;e. What I mean is, that every Child, not allow|ed the Mother's fir&s;t Milk, whether it be dry-nur&s;ed, or &s;uckled by another Woman, &s;hould be purged in a Day or two after the Birth; and this purging continued for &s;ome time; not by regular Do&s;es of Phy&s;ick, that may operate all at once; but &s;ome lenient Laxative &s;hould be contrived, and given two or three times a Day, &s;o as to keep the Child's Body open for the fir&s;t nine Days, or Fortnight; le&s;&s;ening the Quan|tity in&s;en&s;ibly, 'till it be left off. It &s;hould be &s;o managed, that the Operation of the artificial Phy&s;ick may re&s;emble that of the natural. This is &s;o material, that for want of it, mo&s;t Chil|dren within the fir&s;t Month break out in Pimples all over; the Nur&s;es call it the red Gum, and look upon it to be a natural thing, and that the Children will be unhealthy that have it not. So indeed they will be in all like|lihood; and it is better that the&s;e Foulne&s;&s;es, which become acrid and hot by remaining too long in the Body, &s;hould be di&s;charged through
<PB N="29" REF="28">the Skin, than not at all; or that they &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d be lodged in the Blood, or fall upon the Vitals, to lay the Foundation of numberle&s;s future Evils: but it is chiefly owing to the Neglect of this Method at fir&s;t. A Child that &s;ucks its own Mother, unle&s;s it be greatly over-fed, or kept too hot, will never be troubled with this Humour at all. If the Children that are brought to the Ho&s;pital be not above a Month old, and it be found, upon Enquiry, that they have not &s;uck'd their own Mothers, &s;omething of this kind pre&s;cribed them would not be too late, nor improper. The following Form may be u&s;ed: Take Manna, Pulp of Ca&s;&s;ia, of each half an ounce; di&s;&s;olve 'em in about three ounces of thin Broth. Let the Child take two &s;poonfuls three times a Day, varying the Quantity according to the Effect; which at fir&s;t ought to be three or four Stools in four and twenty Hours.</P>
<P>ORDERS &s;hould be given the&s;e Nur&s;es to keep the Children awake by Day, as long as they are di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;o, and to amu&s;e and keep them in good Humour all they can; not to lull and rock them to &s;leep, or to continue their Sleep too long; which is only done to &s;ave their own Time and Trouble, to the great De|triment of the Childrens Health, Spirits, and Under&s;tanding. With regard to Feeding them, as it is not likely they &s;hould have Milk enough to &s;upport two, their own and the Ho&s;pital Child; it is be&s;t they &s;hould begin immediate|ly according to the Method I have recommend|ed,
<PB N="30" REF="29">if they or their In&s;pectors can be per&s;uaded to think it right; which, however, I would not have under&s;tood &s;o &s;trictly, but it might &s;ome|times be a little varied, pre&s;erving only the In|tention. I would advi&s;e, however, if it be thought proper, now and then to give them a little Bread and Butter; that the Butter be per|fectly &s;weet and fre&s;h, and allowed but in very &s;mall Quantity; otherwi&s;e it will be apt to turn bitter and rancid in the Stomach, and foul all the Juices of the Body. A Child might be al|lowed any kind of mellow Fruit, either raw, &s;tewed, or baked; Roots of all &s;orts, and all the Produce of the Kitchen Garden. I am &s;ure all the&s;e things are whol&s;ome and good for them, and every one el&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the idle Notion of their being windy, which they are only to very debauched Stomachs; and &s;o is Milk: but no Man's Blood wants the clean&s;ing, refre&s;hing Power of Milk more than his, who&s;e Stomach, u&s;ed to inflammatory things of high Reli&s;h, will not bear the fir&s;t Chill of it. To Children, all this kind of Food, taken in Mo|deration, is perfectly grateful and &s;alutary. Some may think that they carry into the Sto|mach the Eggs of future Worms; but of this I am not very apprehen&s;ive: for I believe there are few things we eat or drink, that do not con|vey them. But then they can never be hatch'd in a healthy In&s;ide, where all the Juices are &s;weet and good, and every Gland performs its Office; the Gall in particular would de&s;troy
<PB N="31" REF="30">them: Bullocks Gall has been found to be a good and &s;afe Vermifuge. It is my Opinion, we &s;wallow the Eggs of many little Animals, that are never brought into Life within us, ex|cept where they find a fit Ne&s;t or Lodgment in the acid Phlegm, or vitiated Humours of the Stomach and Bowels. Were the&s;e totally di&s;|charged every Day, and the Food of ye&s;terday employed or thrown off to the la&s;t Grain, no Worms could ever harbour in our Vitals. As &s;oon as the Children have any Teeth, at &s;ix or eight Months they may by degrees be u&s;ed to a little Fle&s;h-meat; which they are always very fond of, much more &s;o at fir&s;t, than of any Confectionary or Pa&s;try Wares, with which they &s;hould never debauch their Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>BREEDING Teeth has been thought to be, and is, fatal to many Children; but I am con|fident this is not from Nature: for it is no Di&s;|ea&s;e, or we could not be well in Health 'till one or two and twenty, or later. Teeth are breed|ing the greate&s;t Part of that Time; and it is my Opinion, the la&s;t Teeth give more Pain than the fir&s;t, as the Bones and Gums, they are to pierce, are grown more firm and hard. But whatever Fever, Fits, or other dangerous Symptoms &s;eem to attend this Operation of Nature, healthy Children have &s;ometimes bred their Teeth with|out any &s;uch bad Attendants; which ought to incline us to &s;u&s;pect the Evil not to be natural, but rather the Effect of too great a Fulne&s;s, or the corrupt Humours of the Body put into Agi|tation
<PB N="32" REF="31">by the &s;timulating Pain the Tooth cau&s;es in breaking its way out. This, I believe, ne|ver happens without &s;ome Pain, and po&s;&s;ibly a little Fever; but if the Blood and Juices be per|fectly &s;weet and good, and there be not too great a Redundancy of them, both will be but &s;light, and pa&s;s off imperceptibly, without any bad Con&s;equence whatever. The chief Intention of the Method I am recommending is to pre|&s;erve the Humours of the Body in this State; and therefore if it &s;ucceeds, Children &s;o mana|ged will breed their Teeth with le&s;s Pain and Danger than are commonly ob&s;erved to attend this Work of Nature.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid that the fir&s;t and general Cau&s;e of mo&s;t of the Di&s;ea&s;es Infants are liable to, is the acid Corruption of their Food; it may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to mention an ea&s;y and certain Remedy, or rather Preventive if given timely, at the fir&s;t Appearance of predomina|ting Acid; which is very obvious from the green Stools, Gripes, and Purgings occa&s;ioned by it. The common Method, when the&s;e Symptoms appear, is to give the Pearl Julep, Crabs Eye, and the te&s;taceous Powders, which, tho' they do ab&s;orb the Acidities, have this In|convenience in their Effect, that they are apt to lodge in the Body, and bring on a Co&s;tivene&s;s, very detrimental to Infants, and therefore re|quire a little Manna, or &s;ome gentle Purge to be given frequently to carry them off. In&s;tead of the&s;e, I would recommend a certain fine in|&s;ipid
<PB N="33" REF="32">Powder, called <HI>Magne&s;ia alba,</HI> which at the &s;ame time that it corrects and &s;weetens all Sourne&s;&s;es, rather more effectually than the te&s;taceous Powders, is likewi&s;e a lenient Pur|gative, and keeps the Body gently open. This is the only alkaline Purge I know of, and which our Di&s;pen&s;atories have long wanted. I could wi&s;h it was more univer&s;ally received among us, and think it well de&s;erves the Rank in our Books of Pharmacy, which it already has in &s;ome fo|reign ones. I have taken it my&s;elf, and given it to others for the Heart-burn, and find it to be the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Remedy for that Complaint. It may be given to Children from one to two drams a Day, a little at a time, in all their Food, 'till the Acidities be quite over|come, and the concomitant Symptoms di&s;ap|pear entirely. I have often given it with good and great Effect, even when the Children have been far gone in Di&s;ea&s;es fir&s;t brought on by prevailing Acid.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome other little Niceties that, were they ob&s;erved in the nur&s;ing of Children, would be of &s;ome U&s;e to them; &s;uch as putting them &s;oon upon their Legs, in order to forward their walking; accu&s;toming them to u&s;e both Hands alike; for employing one more than the other, will not only make the Hand and Arm &s;o u&s;ed, but al&s;o that Side of the Body, bigger than the other. This is &s;ometimes the Cau&s;e of Crookedne&s;s. It would likewi&s;e not be ami&s;s to forward their &s;peaking plain, by &s;peak|ing plain di&s;tinct Words to them, in&s;tead of
<PB N="34" REF="33">the Namby Pamby Stile, and giving them back their own broken inarticulate Attempts; by which Means, I believe, &s;ome Children &s;carcely &s;peak intelligibly at &s;even Years of Age. I think they cannot be made rea&s;onable Crea|tures too &s;oon.</P>
<P>THESE few loo&s;e Thoughts on the Subject of Nur&s;ing Children, I &s;end you for your pri|vate Satisfaction, if they be lucky enough to give you any. I have neither Time nor Pati|ence to think of Form and Order, or &s;upport|ing them by affected Demon&s;trations taken from mechanical Principles and Powers. All I have endeavour'd is to be intelligible and u&s;eful; and therefore I have a voided, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all Terms of Art; together with learned Quo|tations, as often produced out of Vanity, and to &s;hew deep Reading, as for the &s;ake of Proof. If you think it may be of any U&s;e to publi&s;h this Letter, I am not unwilling it &s;hould ap|pear; if not, do with it what you plea&s;e. I deliver it up as a <HI>Foundling</HI> to be di&s;po&s;ed of as you think proper. I &s;hall only add by way of Per&s;ua&s;ive to tho&s;e who may be inclined to make Trial of the Method I recommend, that I am a Father, and have already practi&s;ed it with the mo&s;t de&s;irable Succe&s;s.</P>
