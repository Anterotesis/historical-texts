<P>THE AUTHOR of the following DIS|COURSE had, above ten years ago, formed a re&s;olution of writing a full Treati&s;e on Corpulency; both theoretical, and prac|tical; with an appendix concerning its op|po&s;ite extreme, thinne&s;s or leanne&s;s. And had accordingly not only drawn his plan, but began to rai&s;e part of the &s;tructure in the year 1752, then living in London; but &s;oon after returning into the country, at a great di&s;tance from well-furni&s;hed libraries, he could not come at the nece&s;&s;ary books, for rendering his treati&s;e as complete as he in|tended; e&s;pecially the foreign periodical li|terary tran&s;actions: which, he knew, fur|ni&s;hed many ob&s;ervations relating to his &s;ub|ject. He was therefore obliged to lay a&s;ide his intention. However, having &s;ucceeded in an extraordinary ca&s;e of Corpulency, be|yond his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes; and that &s;ole|ly
<PB REF="4">by pur&s;uing a method, which his own reflections had &s;ugge&s;ted, he drew up the following pages, in which the nature and cau&s;es of that burthen&s;ome and dangerous &s;tate of body, and the principal methods of cure indicated therein, are briefly, but he hopes clearly explained; and particularly the method which proved &s;ucce&s;sful, is fully de|&s;cribed and accounted for. The paper was read in a meeting of the ROYAL SOCIETY, November 3, 1757. Though he had not obtained leave to mention in print, the per|&s;on's name, upon whom the cure was made; yet he then produced authentic, and &s;atis|factory vouchers for the truth of the facts; as the very learned and worthy &s;ecretary of the &s;aid Soiety, Dr. BIRCH, will te&s;tify.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON CORPULENCY.</HEAD>
<P>CORPULENCY, when in an extraordinary degree, may be rec|koned a di&s;ea&s;e, as it in &s;ome mea&s;ure ob&s;tructs the free exerci&s;e of the animal functions; and hath a ten|dency to &s;horten life, by paving the way to dangerous di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>It is too great an accumulation of animal oil or fat, more or le&s;s over the whole body; but chiefly immediately under the &s;kin, in the inter&s;tices of the mu&s;cles; and within the cavity of the abdomen or lower belly.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<P>That Corpulency is cau&s;ed by an increa|&s;ed quantity of fat, and not of blood, or any other &s;ub&s;tance what&s;oever, is &s;o clear and evident, that we may &s;pare our&s;elves the trouble of proving it. Butchers &s;talls &s;uffi|ciently evince it's truth, and the common &s;en&s;e of mankind acquie&s;ces in it; fat and corpulent being &s;ynonymous epithets in common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Till within a century ago, anatomi&s;ts had a very imperfect notion of the manner, in which the fat is di&s;tributed, and lodged in the animal body; they imagined that it lies in confu&s;ed clu&s;ters or heaps, &s;ticking to the parts where it is found, without being contained in cells, or &s;mall membranous cavities. But now it is generally and cer|tainly known, that it is repo&s;ited in the cells or ve&s;icles of a certain web or texture, called membrana, or tela cellulo&s;a; which is &s;pread over the whole body, not only im|mediately under the &s;kin, but penetrating likewi&s;e into it's inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es; and enter|ing, more or le&s;s, into the compo&s;ition of almo&s;t every part. The cells of this web
<PB N="3" REF="7">or ti&s;&s;ue are &s;o framed, as to communicate together all over. Where they are wide&s;t, they contain oil or fat. Where they are too minute for that purpo&s;e, they receive a fluid jelly or moi&s;t vapour.</P>
<P>The fat is a &s;ecretion from the blood, made by the mo&s;t &s;imple &s;ecretory appara|tus, to wit, arteries bringing the blood, from which the fat is to be &s;eparated; and lateral ve&s;&s;els of a le&s;&s;er diameter ari|&s;ing from the&s;e arteries, which &s;train off the fat or oil, and convey it to the cells or ve&s;icles, where it is to be repo&s;ited; while &s;mall veins, continued with the arteries, re|turn into the common channel of circula|tion that part of the blood, which hath pa&s;&s;ed by the mouths of the lateral &s;ecretory canals. The tumidity, with which the oil, when new &s;eparated, abounds, is &s;ucked up by extremely &s;mall tubules of the venous kind, opening into or communicating with the fatty cells, and &s;o the fat or oil remains more pure or unmixed.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the fat is in general to lubri|cate the parts, that they may move and &s;lip over one another ea&s;ily, and therefore mu&s;|cles
<PB N="4" REF="8">are plentifully &s;upplied with it; to pre|vent brittlene&s;s in the bones, which for that rea&s;on are furni&s;hed with marrow (for mar|row and fat &s;carce differ at all from one an|other) to temper, and, as it were, &s;heath a|crimony; and la&s;tly, to fill up the cha&s;ms and inter&s;tices, which, without &s;ome &s;uch contrivance, would be left between parts ad|jacent to each other, thus procuring a beau|tiful &s;leekne&s;s to the &s;kin. In particular we have good rea&s;on to believe, that the fat of the omentum or cawl, where it is always found in con&s;iderable quantity, if the &s;ub|ject is not very much emaciated, is &s;ub&s;er|vient to the functions of the liver, and con|tributes towards the matter of the bile. But I confine my&s;elf to the principal &s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The efficient cau&s;es of Corpulency may be deduced to the&s;e following:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the taking in of too large a quan|tity of food, e&s;pecially of the rich and oily kind, with a &s;uitable dige&s;tion. Every thing that nouri&s;hes, contains oil more or le&s;s, which however &s;canty in proportion to the other con&s;tituent parts, is yet actually &s;epa|rated
<PB N="5" REF="9">and extracted from them by the pow|ers of the animal machine, and, as it were, trea&s;ured up for it's proper u&s;es. Hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep, and many other animals, thrive and fatten upon gra&s;s, hay, and even &s;traw, with water. But the poore&s;t diet, that can nouri&s;h, and tolerably &s;upport the human &s;pecies, contains much more oil, than gra&s;s or &s;traw. Oil may be pre&s;&s;ed out of the farinaceous grains in common u&s;e. Animals of every kind, however lean, yet contain &s;ome fat, and tho&s;e we daily feed on, a very great deal. Whoever, therefore, throws in a large quantity even of the plaine&s;t whole|&s;ome food, at the &s;ame time lays in matter, out of which Corpulency is more likely to be produced, than out of a more &s;paring mea&s;ure thereof. And, beyond all doubt, that effect will more &s;peedily and certainly be brought about, if the aliment is oily and rich; provided it is rightly dige&s;ted. Not that all corpulent per&s;ons are great eaters; or all thin per&s;ons &s;pare feeders. We daily &s;ee in&s;tances of the contrary. Tho' a vo|racious appetite be one cau&s;e of Corpulency, it is not the only cau&s;e; and very often not even the <HI>conditio &s;ine qua non</HI> thereof.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="10">
<P>Secondly, too lax a texture of the cellular or fatty membrane, we have already men|tioned, whereby it's cells or ve&s;icles are lia|ble to be too ea&s;ily di&s;tended; and therefore receive and retain too great a quantity of fat. And perhaps the&s;e cells may be origi|nally of a larger &s;ize and capacity in &s;ome, than in others. This di&s;po&s;ition may be connected with a general laxity of the &s;olids, but it may likewi&s;e be in a great mea&s;ure local, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t by it&s;elf; there being no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing one part or &s;et of parts in the human frame to be over-relaxed, while the re&s;t continue in a laudable &s;tate. This particular cau&s;e of Corpulency I incline to believe often runs in families. It may likewi&s;e be connate, that is, interwoven with the original &s;tamina, and brought into the world by the infant, tho' it's parents and ance&s;tors had been otherwi&s;e con&s;tituted. But, no doubt, it is much ofter acquired by the manner of living of the corpulent per|&s;ons; &s;uch as a plentiful, rich, relaxing diet; a &s;edentary life; much &s;leep; an indolent tranquillity of mind; warm bathing, &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="11" MS="y">
<P>Thirdly, &s;uch a mixture or cra&s;is of the blood and it's &s;erum, as &s;uffers the only parts to be too &s;afely &s;eparated from it's other principles, e&s;pecially it's aqueous vehi|cle; the whole being too weakly and im|perfectly blended and united together. This fault may either depend upon the general inaction of the &s;olids, whether con&s;titutional or acquired; and the chief means of bring|ing it on are, as hath been &s;aid, plentiful, luxurious diet, and want of exerci&s;e; or upon an over-proportion of oily particles in the blood, and it's &s;erum; which may re|quire a greater energy in the &s;olids, though otherwi&s;e laudably con&s;tituted, than they can exert, in order to get the better of that exce&s;s, and complete the union of the hete|rogeneous parts.</P>
<P>Fourthly and la&s;tly, Corpulency is cau&s;ed by a defective evacuation through the out|lets of the body, of that fat or oil, which hath been already &s;eparated from the blood, and repo&s;ited in it's proper cells. As what|ever is alimentary contains oil, if we did not daily expell part of it out of the body, we &s;hould &s;oon be buried under our own
<PB N="8" REF="12">fat. Tho&s;e, who keep up for a con&s;idera|ble number of years nearly the &s;ame weight of body, mu&s;t di&s;charge daily a quantity of oil or fat, nearly equal to what they take in. Sweat, urine, foeces, and no doubt in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration likewi&s;e, all contain oil in an healthy &s;tate; and therefore, if they are not in a pretty con&s;tant way &s;ufficiently charg|ed therewith, to ballance the quantity con|&s;tantly introduced with our meats and drinks, Corpulency mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue. This deficiency is, I believe, mo&s;t frequently occa|&s;ioned by a too &s;edentary way of life. But it likewi&s;e may be influenced by the fat's not being &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olvible in, and remix|ed with the blood as it &s;hould be, in order to be readily enough brought to the emunc|tories; and &s;o may in &s;ome ca&s;es be a con|&s;equence of the cau&s;e de&s;cribed in the pre|ceding paragraph. For, if the blood and it's &s;erum hath already too ea&s;ily parted with it's oily particles, that happened be|cau&s;e in them the oil was not &s;trongly enough united and blended with the other con&s;ti|tuent principles, and therefore the &s;ame quality of the blood and juices will render them &s;o much the more unfit to re-di&s;&s;olve, and &s;weep it out of the cells, in which it is
<PB N="9" REF="13">laid up, back into the channels of circula|tion and excretion.</P>
<P>To recapitulate, Corpulency being an ac|cumulation of too great a quantity of fat, or animal oil in the ve&s;icles of the membra|na cellulo&s;a, wherever they are large enough to admit oily particles, it can be cau&s;ed either by the introduction of too much oil into the habit, through the channels of nouri&s;hment, whereby there is &s;o much the greater chance of it's being retained in too great a quantity&mdash;or by the over-laxity, or perhaps original over-largene&s;s of the cells, in which it is repo&s;ited, di&s;po&s;ing them to admit, and retain an over-proportion of it&mdash;Or by &s;uch a cra&s;is or temperament of the blood, as renders it liable to part too ea&s;ily with it's oily particles, and let them be &s;trained off in too great plenty by the &s;ecre|tory ve&s;&s;els&mdash;Or la&s;tly, by a deficient evacu|ation or expul&s;ion of oil already taken in and &s;eparated from the blood, and laid up in it's cells through the outlets of the body&mdash;By one, or more of the&s;e cau&s;es, or per|haps all of them concurring in the &s;ame con&s;titution, and, I think, &s;carce by any
<PB N="10" REF="14">other of moment, can Corpulency be pro|duced and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Having enquired into the nature, &s;eat, and efficient cau&s;es of Corpulency, we now pro|ceed to lay down the rational methods of cure, founded on the re&s;ult of this our en|quiry. In the doing of which, we &s;hall but briefly treat of &s;uch things relating to the &s;ubject, as are commonly known and delivered in books; and be more full con|cerning the particular means we propo&s;e, in order to dimini&s;h and keep under this burthen&s;ome &s;tate of body, and prevent it's bad con&s;equences; to recommend and en|force the u&s;e of which, this paper is princi|pally intended.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es, like other faults and imperfec|tions, are, in a general way, to be attacked and conquered by remedies, oppo&s;ite or contrary to the cau&s;es that brought them on; and that is exqui&s;itely the ca&s;e with re|&s;pect to Corpulency. We &s;hall therefore, in delivering the method of cure, follow the order, in which we have treated of it's cau&s;es.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="15">
<P>And fir&s;t, the diet of corpulent per&s;ons ought to be as moderate in quantity as pru|dence may direct, and one's patience can &s;ubmit to. Cel&s;us advi&s;es &s;uch to eat only one meal a-day. With us cutting off &s;uppers may be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of this rule. As to how much food is to be taken at one time, the be&s;t advice I can give is, after eating &s;uch a quantity, as is known in a common way to &s;upport per&s;ons in health and &s;trength, to &s;top, as &s;oon as the craving of the &s;tomach will permit; and &s;o ri&s;e from table with an appetite. In &s;ome ca&s;es it may be expedient to damp the &s;tomach immediately before meals, by eating fruits or &s;weetmeats; by drinking a gla&s;s of &s;weet wine; or other &s;uch &s;afe means, as one's own experience will be&s;t direct. Variety of di&s;hes &s;hould not be made free with; as they are apt to tempt one to tran&s;gre&s;s in quantity.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to quality, the food of the corpulent &s;hould be lean and plain, rather than rich and palatable. Cel&s;us enumerates among&s;t the cau&s;es that fill or plump the
<PB N="12" REF="16">body. <HI>A&s;&s;umpta per cibus aut potus maxime dulcia &amp; pinguia.</HI> Cour&s;e brown bread is here preferable to the white, finer &s;ort, as being more opening and le&s;s nouri&s;hing&mdash;Roots, greens, and other e&s;culent vegeta|bles, with a &s;paring quantity of butter, dif|po&s;e le&s;s to Corpulency, than animal foods; as they contain le&s;s oil; yield juices le&s;s vi&s;cid, and pa&s;s more readily out of the body&mdash;Wines in a general way are le&s;s feeding than malt liquors; e&s;pecially &s;uch as are thin, &s;harp and old&mdash;Acids, and vine|gar in particular, have a remarkably emaci|ating quality; but mu&s;t be u&s;ed &s;paringly, and with caution.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of Corpulency, mentioned in the &s;econd place, being a flabby, relaxed &s;tate of the membranous texture, in the cells of which the fat is collected, the indi|cation of cure an&s;wering thereto, is to &s;trengthen that texture, &s;o enabling it the better to re&s;i&s;t di&s;ten&s;ion; and, by it's con|tractile power, to expel &s;ome part of it's contents. In order to an&s;wer this end the more effectually, it is requi&s;ite, fir&s;t to dimi|ni&s;h, if we can, in a con&s;iderable degree, the quantity of fat already contained in
<PB N="13" REF="17">the&s;e cells, that they may be the more at liberty to contract them&s;elves; and after|wards remaining in a contracted &s;tate, reco|ver their tone. In the next place we mu&s;t take care &s;o to concert mea&s;ures in order to &s;trengthen either the &s;olids in general, or the cellular texture, where the fat is lodged, in particular, as neither to counteract the other methods directed again&s;t Corpulency, of which more in the &s;equel; nor ri&s;k hurt|ing the particular con&s;titution we are treat|ing. Cold bathing (proper diet and exer|ci&s;e being &s;uppo&s;ed to go along) bids faire&s;t to an&s;wer the end we have in view. But it will be both &s;afer and more effectual after the bulk is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed than before. And it ought never to be u&s;ed without great caution, le&s;t it &s;hould prove hurtful in other re&s;pects; for I &s;carce know any remedy that is more generally, and more dangerou&s;ly mi&s;applied, than cold bathing. As to &s;trengtheners taken inward|ly, whether under the title of diet or medi|cines, they for the mo&s;t part either whet the appetite, or render the body co&s;tive, both which are unfavourable to the cure of Corpulency; and upon that account they, as well as cold bathing, will come into u&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="18">with greater advantage, after the body is con&s;iderably reduced, than before.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e of Corpulency being too ea&s;y a &s;eparation of the oily particles of the blood from it's other contents, e&s;pecially the aqueous vehicle, ari&s;ing from a weak and imperfect union of the different ele|ments together, what occurs to me as mo&s;t directly tending to it's removal, is,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by a &s;pare and plain diet to with|hold, or at lea&s;t dimini&s;h the daily fre&s;h &s;up|plies of oily matter to the blood; that the &s;olids, by who&s;e action and energy that union, and as it were cohe&s;ion of the principles of the blood effected, may not have more work, to do than enough: And,</P>
<P>Next to excite the action of the &s;olids; which is to be done chiefly by exerci&s;e; un|der which, I comprehend friction or dry rubbing of the &s;urface of the body, e&s;peci|ally the trunk, as a meterial article. And this kind of exerci&s;e is &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary to extremely corpulent per&s;ons, that they can &s;carcely u&s;e any other with remark|able effect. Strengtheners, that heat mode|rately,
<PB N="15" REF="19">if judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, may come in as auxiliaries.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of Corpulency a&s;&s;igned in the fourth and la&s;t place, being a defective eva|cuation through the outlets of the body of the animal oil or fat already taken in, the cu|rative indication naturally ari&s;ing therefrom, is to promote and increa&s;e that di&s;charge, by the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual methods; that &s;o the daily wa&s;te of the oily parts being brought to exceed the con&s;tant &s;upplies there|of, the quantity remaining within the habit may be properly dimini&s;hed. Now the common natural excretions, to wit, urine, foeces, &s;weat, and in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration be|ing in a healthy &s;tate, always more or le&s;s charged with animal oil, its expul&s;ion is to be procured through the&s;e channels; and indeed it can &s;carce be brought about any other way, without violence to the con&s;ti|tution. If therefore, one or more of the&s;e excretions be increa&s;ed with &s;afety to the ge|neral health, and without le&s;&s;ening propor|tionably the re&s;t, the quantity of fat in the body mu&s;t in time be dimini&s;hed.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="20">
<P>In&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, in our climate can carry off but little oil, e&s;pecially in corpulent per&s;ons, where the extraordinary accumula|tion of fat under the &s;kin mu&s;t compre&s;s the arteries that go to it; through the &s;mall ex|cretory ve&s;&s;els, that ari&s;e from which, the matter of per&s;piration pa&s;&s;es, and is convey|ed off; and therefore no mighty &s;tre&s;s is to be laid upon promoting that di&s;charge, more than what friction may effect.</P>
<P>Frequent purging, if it could be &s;afely brought on, would no doubt be a &s;peedy and effectual means of reducing Corpulency. We &s;ee often in practice what va&s;t quantities of animal juices, all which contain oil more or le&s;s, are evacuated per annum, in a diar|rhaea or cholera morbus; and how much the patient is emaciated thereby in not many hours. But it is dangerous to proceed far this way by art. Purgatives often exhibited, be&s;ides weakening the general habit by car|rying off the nutritive &s;erum, hurt the &s;to|mach through which they mu&s;t pa&s;s; and the inte&s;tines &s;till more, where they exert their principal efficacy, and mu&s;t remain longer; they may bring on dy&s;enteries and
<PB N="17" REF="21">ulcerations of the guts, with all their dire|ful train of &s;ymptoms, by abating the natu|ral mucus of the parts, dy&s;enteries, hemorr|hoids, &amp;c. What therefore is mo&s;t advi&s;e|able to be done by the corpulent per&s;on in this re&s;pect is, to u&s;e &s;uch a diet and man|ner of living, as may prevent co&s;tivene&s;s; and occa&s;ionally take &s;afe openers in &s;mall do&s;es, and no oftner than is nece&s;&s;ary to re|move it. Aloetic medicines are here prefer|able to rhubarb (except where piles are trou|ble&s;ome) as they are le&s;s apt to leave a bind|ing quality after their operation is over, walk|ing, in a general way, promotes the evacu|ation per anum. Riding, as well as a &s;e|detary life, encourages co&s;tivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Sweat &s;eems to contain more oil than the other fluid excretions; and therefore promot|ing it often, if it could be done &s;afely and conveniently, might no doubt be of the highe&s;t efficacy in reducing a corpulent habit&mdash;The &s;afe&s;t way of rai&s;ing &s;weat is by en|crea&s;ed mu&s;cular motion, as walking hard, playing at tennis, exerci&s;ing &s;ome laborious mechanic employment, or the like. The next &s;afe&s;t way in my opinion, is by moi&s;t heat; as in a bagnio. Medicines given to &s;weat
<PB N="18" REF="22">upon, be&s;ides the uncertainty of their ope|ration, may do hurt by overheating and by changing the cra&s;is of the blood and juices, for the wor&s;e, if they are frequently admi|ni&s;tred.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the natural excretions, by which animal oil is carried out of the body, is urine. The urine of a &s;ound per&s;on, made after a due concoction of the aliments and chyle, contains an animal oil exalted by re|peated circulations, and the heat of the bo|dy, and tending &s;omewhat to the volatile and putrid, as all chymi&s;ts of note agree. Now, as the excretion of urine may be pro|moted by a variety of diuretics, with le&s;s &s;hock to the con&s;titution, than that by &s;weat, or &s;tools; and with tolerable certainty too, where there is no morbid ob&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;ages; it would appear highly rea&s;onable to conclude, that animal oil may both more &s;afely, and more effectually in the end, be di&s;charged out of the body through the chan|nels of urine, than by any of the other ways already treated of; as the increa&s;ing of that evacuation can be brought about more con|&s;tantly and uniformly; and longer per&s;i&s;ted in, becau&s;e attended with le&s;s danger or in|conveniency.
<PB N="19" REF="23">But that diureticts may be em|ployed to the be&s;t advantage, in order to di&s;|charge the animal oil, and by that means re|duce Corpulency, it is requi&s;ite to choo&s;e out of that exten&s;ive cla&s;s of medicines, &s;uch as, be&s;ides increa&s;ing the quantity of urine, may at the &s;ame time render the animal oil more mixible with the watry vehicle of the blood, than otherwi&s;e it would be. Urine, be&s;ides water, which con&s;titutes much the greate&s;t part of it, contains oil, as hath been already &s;aid, an e&s;&s;ential &s;alt peculiar to it&s;elf, re&s;embling &s;al armoniac in many re&s;pects, but differing from it in &s;ome material pro|perties; and a fine &s;ubtili&s;ed earth abraded from the ve&s;&s;els, by the con&s;tant motion of the liquids through them. But 'tis the in|crea&s;e of the evacuation of the oil only, that can dimini&s;h Corpulency; and therefore it is evident that &s;uch diuretics, as are endow|ed with the property above-mentioned, are to have the preference here.</P>
<P>Now we are &s;o happy as to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a diuretic medicine, which hath that quali|ty in a &s;ingularly eminent degree; and is withal &s;o &s;afe, as that it may be taken in large quan|tities every day for years together, without remarkably impairing the general health:
<PB N="20" REF="24">that medicine is &s;oap, which we &s;hall here endeavour to prove, both by rea&s;on and ob|&s;ervation, to be exqui&s;itely proper for reduc|ing Corpulency, in the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effec|tual manner; in a word, its true remedy where it is curable.</P>
<P>Soap in general (for there is a variety of &s;oaps) is a compo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ting of a veget|able, fixt, alcaline &s;alt, made by incineration, and oil or fat, whether animal or vegetable, with the addition of quick-lime, in &s;ome form or other, intimately and in&s;eparably incorporated together, by boiling accord|ing to art. Quick-lime, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of boiling, hath been found by experience to be the fitte&s;t bond of union between the&s;e two &s;o different and repugnant &s;ub|&s;tances, without which it cannot be complete|ly effected, at lea&s;t not &s;o ea&s;ily and commo|diou&s;ly. Soap, as is well known, is entirely di&s;&s;olvable in &s;oft water; and that &s;olution a&s;&s;i&s;ted by heat, agitation and friction, di&s;|&s;olves, be&s;ides gums and re&s;ins, likewi&s;e oil, and animal fat, incorporating them with it|&s;elf, thus fitting them to be &s;coured and wa&s;hed off from the &s;ub&s;tances they adhere to. And therefore its general, as well as its original u&s;e, is to clean cloaths, e&s;pecially
<PB N="21" REF="25">linnen, when &s;oiled with animal filth, in which oil is the predominant ingredient, as being both mo&s;t penetrating, and adhering mo&s;t ob&s;tinately; at the &s;ame time cement|ing with it&s;elf other &s;oiling particles of what|ever kind. And yet, by the means of &s;oap, they are ea&s;ily re&s;tored to cleanne&s;s, &s;weet|ne&s;s, and whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>It is le&s;s to be wondered that &s;oap &s;hould have been introduced into the regular prac|tice of phy&s;ic, as an inward medicine, con|&s;idering its wonderful di&s;&s;olving virtue; than that it was introduced &s;o late. In Lemery's Dictionaire des Drogues, fir&s;t publi&s;hed at Paris, in 1694, the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t noted book of its kind in the hands of the public at that time, and for &s;ome years after, there is no mention made of the internal u&s;e of &s;oap. It hath been much u&s;ed inwardly &s;ince, and de&s;ervedly held in great e&s;teem as a re&s;olvent, detergent, and deob&s;truent; and of late as a lithontriptic. It is found to be a diuretic of the milder &s;ort. The great run of Mrs. Stephen's medicines, both as publi&s;hed by her&s;elf, and as &s;ince new mo|deled and amended, not to mention num|berle&s;s ca&s;es well known to the public, in
<PB N="22" REF="26">which &s;oap hath been given for the &s;tone ei|ther by it&s;elf or with lime water, &s;ufficient|ly evince its &s;afety, whole ounces having been exhibited every day for years together, without remarkably injuring the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>As therefore &s;oap is diuretic; hath a &s;in|gular power of rendering oil or fat mixible with water; and withall is &s;o fafe, as that it may be given in large quantities, and its u&s;e long continued, we may fairly conclude, that it is a mo&s;t effectual, harmle&s;s and ea&s;y re|medy for reducing Corpulency; and, to &s;um up all, more to be depended upon than any other yet propo&s;ed. This will farther ap|pear from the following con&s;iderations. Per|&s;ons inclined to Corpulency &s;eldom think on reducing their &s;ize, till they grow very bulky; and then they &s;carce can, or will u&s;e exerci&s;e enough to be remarkably &s;erviceable. It be|comes a great trouble to them: Indolence u&s;ually gets the better of re&s;olution, and feeds the growing evil, until what was at fir&s;t only di&s;agreeable and difficult, becomes at length impracticable&mdash;Where a rich and plentiful diet is one principal cau&s;e of Corpulency, as it often is, the habits of good eating and
<PB N="23" REF="27">drinking becomes &s;o deeply rivetted, as &s;carce to be conquered. A luxurious table, a keen appetite, and good company are temptations to exceed often too &s;trong for human nature to re&s;i&s;t. Sweating and purging for the in|crea&s;e of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, as hath been already ob&s;erved, is herein in&s;ignificant, though very proper now and then, yet can|not be u&s;ed with &s;afety frequently and con|&s;tantly enough to do the bu&s;ine&s;s by it&s;elf, and atone for errors in point of regimen&mdash;whereas &s;oap may be &s;afely u&s;ed in large quantities every day for years together.</P>
<P>It is no &s;mall additional recommendation in favour of this remedy, that it is highly proper for relieving complaints, and curing di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from Corpulency, even inde|pendently on dimini&s;hing it, &s;uch as among&s;t the chronic tribe, &s;hort windedne&s;s; lethar|gy, &amp;c. of the acute kind, ba&s;tard peripneu|monics, which are more difficult to cure in very &s;at per&s;ons than others: and in general whatever di&s;orders may be owing to vi&s;cidity of juices, a never failing attendant on pleni|tude, and defect of motion. But to pro&s;e|cute this head farther, would lead us beyond
<PB N="24" REF="28">the bounds we have at pre&s;ent pre&s;cribed to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We now proceed to take into con&s;ideration the manner of exhibiting &s;oap, with a view to reduce Corpulency. And fir&s;t let us choo&s;e the fitte&s;t kind for that purpo&s;e. Spani&s;h &s;oap, particularly that from Alicant, is at pre|&s;ent mo&s;t e&s;teemed for inward u&s;e. And al|though in the ob&s;ervation I am going to re|late, the common home made Ca&s;tile &s;oap was u&s;ed, yet, I he&s;itate not to give the pre|ference to that from Alicant. It is not only a more cleanly and le&s;s di&s;agreeable medicine, but is much more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved in water; and therefore mu&s;t an&s;wer better in every intention where &s;oap is required.</P>
<P>As to the manner of exhibiting it, I think once a-day may be &s;ufficient. And I appre|hend the propere&s;t time is at night when going to bed. A drachm (the eighth part of an ounce) may be tried for the fir&s;t four or five days: and if that creates no remark|able di&s;order in the &s;tomach or bowels, the quantity &s;hould be increa&s;ed to two, three, and in very &s;tubborn ca&s;es, to four drachms; which la&s;t do&s;e, I think, needs not in any
<PB N="25" REF="29">ca&s;e to be exceeded. It may be taken either &s;liced down &s;mall, and made into the form of a bolus or electuary, with any pala|table &s;yrup, as that made with orange or ci|tron peel; or it may be &s;wallowed in the &s;hape of pills; or it may be di&s;&s;olved in a gill or more of &s;oft water, and &s;o drank.</P>
<P>This cour&s;e &s;hould be continued at lea&s;t three months, in order to give it a fair trial; in which time, without great errors on the cor|pulent per&s;on's &s;ide, I think it highly proba|ble, that remarkable benefit will be felt in a common way. If good &s;ervice is really done, the patient will, at lea&s;t ought to be, encouraged to go on. If his patience &s;hould &s;ometimes be tired out, he may intermit the u&s;e of the remedy for &s;ome days; and afterwards re&s;ume it for three or four months longer; and &s;o on, dropping or renewing the cour&s;e, as his own direction, or &s;kilful advice may be&s;t direct.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e, will, I hope, greatly both illu&s;trate and confirm what hath been hitherto &s;aid. A worthy acquaintance of mine, a judicious and experienced phy&s;ician, in his younger days had been very active,
<PB N="26" REF="30">and u&s;ed much exerci&s;e, both on foot and on hor&s;eback; and for many years &s;eemed as little liable to extreme Corpulency as mo&s;t people. By in&s;en&s;ible degrees, as he dimi|ni&s;hed his daily labours, &s;atne&s;s &s;tole upon him, and kept increa&s;ing; in&s;omuch that, when I met with him about &s;ix years ago, I found him in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s through mere Corpulency, of any per&s;on not ex|ceeding middle age, I ever knew. He was then about forty-five. He was obliged to ride from hou&s;e to hou&s;e to vi&s;it his patients in the town where he practi&s;ed, being quite unable to walk an hundred yards at a &s;tretch; and was in no &s;mall degree lethargic. In other re&s;pects, he &s;eemed pretty clear of any remarkable di&s;ea&s;e, except gout, of which he had felt &s;ome, not very violent, attacks. I warmly recommended the inward u&s;e of &s;oap, in order to reduce his Corpulency, as the only &s;afe and effectual remedy in his ca&s;e, and a remedy which he might con|tinue to u&s;e the longe&s;t; I enforced my advice by the rea&s;onings above urged, of which he was too good a judge not to per|ceive their full cogency. Accordingly, he began to take it July, 1754, at which time he weighed twenty &s;tone and eleven pounds,
<PB N="27" REF="31">jockey weight, a va&s;t load for him to bear, who is little above middle &s;tature, and withal &s;mall boned. He took every night at bed-time, a quarter of an ounce of com|mon home-made ca&s;tile &s;oap, di&s;&s;olved in a quarter of a pint of &s;oft water. In about two or three months time, he be|gan to feel more freedom, and an increa&s;e of activity, which encouraged him to per|&s;evere. And that he did with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in Augu&s;t, 1756, (as he informs me in a letter now lying before me) his bulk was reduced two whole &s;tone weight; and he could walk a mile with plea&s;ure. He had continued the u&s;e of the &s;oap all the time between June, 1754, and Augu&s;t, 1756, with very &s;hort interruptions, in the manner and quantity above mentioned; it operated remarkably by urine, without ever produ|cing the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome effect. And now, while I am &s;ending the&s;e pages to the pre&s;s, (April 1760) I am certainly in|formed that he is hearty, and well.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts are well known all over the town, where my friend re&s;ides, and it's neighbourhood; and it is the general opi|nion, that, had it not been for the relief
<PB N="28" REF="32">that was then given him, he mu&s;t have been in his grave long before now. Let me add, that he u&s;ed no other method or medicine all the while, to which the extra|ordinary change in his favour, can with any colour of rea&s;on be imputed.</P>
<P>I have taken opportunities of recommend|ing the &s;ame remedy to others, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances; but have not been as yet informed of any ca&s;e, in which a thorough trial thereof was made. However, as it proved &s;o &s;ignally &s;erviceable in the in&s;tance above-mentioned, under &s;uch di&s;advantages, I hope it may be fairly concluded it may prove u&s;eful in a general way, at lea&s;t in ca&s;es le&s;s &s;tubborn: which con&s;ideration is &s;ufficient to recommend it to the attention of phy&s;icians, and the public.</P>
