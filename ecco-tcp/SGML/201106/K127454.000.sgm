<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TO a woman who never wrote more than a common letter, it &s;eemeth &s;omewhat awkward to take up the pen to write for public peru&s;al, but my friends de&s;ire that I may do it; they have a better opinion of me, than I have of my&s;elf; they &s;ay if I give nothing new to the world, I may &s;till be u&s;eful to my own &s;ex, by recommending many things familiar to my experience, which they may have had few opportunities of knowing; much experience is not the portion of many young women; few read large elaborate works, and many would be glad to receive in&s;truction advantageous to them|&s;elves and their families, from a &s;mall pam|phlet; they have many occupations, and care not to torment them&s;elves with technical terms in languages unknown to them, or toil over hundreds of pages they do not under&s;tand; my greate&s;t anxiety &s;hall be to be plain and ea&s;ily com|prehended. Some females a&s;cend into the paths
<PB N="ii" REF="3">of literature, by accident, genius, or indu&s;try; to the fir&s;t and la&s;t I am indebted, but as to the &s;econd, alas, I have few preten&s;ions; all I can boa&s;t of, is, much good temper, patience, and a tolerable &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>If this little E&s;&s;ay &s;hould make its way to the hands of a learned critic, it is not improba|ble, that after reading the title page, and &s;eeing it comes from a midwife, he may throw it a&s;ide with di&s;dain, &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;mells too &s;trong of gruel, caudle, and the &s;lops of the nur&s;ery, and &s;o I may e&s;cape a &s;courging from him; but another, after &s;ome inve&s;tigation, may tell us that this ob&s;tetric dame might have employed her&s;elf better with her needle; a third, with as much good nature, and full as much &s;ci|ence, may kindly invite her into the field of literature, hoping that a little more &s;tudy may enable her to correct her deficiencies, and I will bend to him with obedience and the lowe&s;t
<PB N="iii" REF="4">courte&s;y of my acknowledgment for his gen|tlene&s;s and liberality.</P>
<P>The intention of this E&s;&s;ay is, to convey to my amiable country-women &s;ome hints or in&s;tructions how to pre&s;erve them&s;elves in pregnancy from evils that often torment or de&s;troy them, and from which a little rational in&s;truction may &s;tand as it were like a beacon, to point out latent evil; and I have the vanity to hope that my humble attempts to be u&s;eful, will neither be neglected nor lo&s;t. Another part of my intention is, as a tender mother my&s;elf, to teach others who have le&s;s experi|ence, how to &s;uperintend their infant offspring. This is an important concern, for it is a me|lancholy truth, that above half the human race &s;uffer much, or &s;ink into untimely graves, before they are two or three years old; nor is it unlikely, that many of the&s;e infants are in|jured by the ignorance or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of per&s;ons employed to look after them; perhaps in my
<PB N="iv" REF="5">way through this little tract I may touch on the office or duty of a midwife, and other articles in a mi&s;cellaneous manner. On &s;exual di&s;or|ders it was my intention to have expo&s;ed the futility of what is often done, and how to &s;ub|&s;titute &s;ome things more effectual; but I find my&s;elf incapable of writing publicly on this branch of feminine infirmities, without violat|ing in &s;ome degree, my own &s;en&s;e of delicacy and mode&s;ty, but to make up for this, it is my intention henceforward, to act as a midwife, and to give advice, and even particular me|dicines, in all di&s;ea&s;es of women and children, to all who may do me the honour to employ me; whenever I may be puzzled, (the mo&s;t able are non-plu&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes though they may not own it) it is my determination to apply for help, to &s;ome of my friends, phy&s;icians of learning and much experience, that will readily give me their be&s;t advice.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="6">
<P>The di&s;ea&s;es of children are numerous, and require the mo&s;t careful examination. I have &s;tudied them much on pathological prin|ciples, and though I have not con&s;umed much of the midnight oil, have been &s;ucce&s;sful in removing them. That di&s;mal train of evils that depends on worms bred in the inte&s;tines of children, and frequently of grown up per|&s;ons, may commonly be removed by proper attention. I pretend not to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of infallible no&s;trums, nor would I practi&s;e on dogmatical principles, for then we can have no clue to cau&s;es, nor could we have occa&s;ion for rea&s;on or education; a few recipes without knowledge, would in this ca&s;e be &s;ufficient to cure di&s;ea&s;es; on this plan, a per&s;on who knows the names of the ropes and &s;ails may go to &s;ea, but, without the art of navigation, he would &s;eldom carry a &s;hip &s;afe to her port.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed I am no great theori&s;t, yet I am not altogether ignorant of pathology, or the difference in di&s;tempers, or of their cau&s;es and effects. I have practi&s;ed much among poor people, gratis, on the Continent and at home, giving them their medicines, be|cau&s;e, I think it a duty on all to do good, and my intentions have been an&s;wered with general &s;ucce&s;s. It is my intention &s;till to carry on this eleemo&s;ynary practice, with this differ|ence, that in London, I cannot afford to fur|ni&s;h remedies for all that may want them, but, if female paupers will call Sundays and Thur&s;|days, in the morning, from 8 to 10 o'clock, they &s;hall be welcome to my be&s;t endeavours to &s;erve them. If they are &s;ober, and obe|dient to directions, I will &s;ometimes give them medicines, and I &s;hall never be wanting to their welfare; if not, they mu&s;t not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed, if I excu&s;e my&s;elf from hearing their complaints.</P>
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
<P>If any per&s;on who never heard of me before, &s;hould have any inclination to employ me, they may naturally wi&s;h to know who I am, and to know my character; I &s;hall only hope to be known, my vouchers are neither ob&s;cure or unworthy of notice; I may venture to &s;ay this for my&s;elf, my friends all &s;ay it of me, though no &s;ycophant, I never yet made a foe, or lo&s;t a friend. It may be objected to my propo&s;als, that this E&s;&s;ay may be regarded as a quack adverti&s;ement; I feel, and I dread the force of &s;uch a charge, but I am neither a boa&s;ter, nor a vain pretender, this truth may be ea&s;ily made evident. I may, after &s;ix years re&s;idence, call my&s;elf a &s;tranger in this great city, for I am very little known, only to a few friends of the middle rank, who cannot &s;tep beyond their line to recommend me, and I may remain in ob&s;curity, were I now to &s;up|pre&s;s this E&s;&s;ay, which may be found u&s;eful by many, on purpo&s;e to prevent the calumny of objectors. My friends &s;upport my &s;pirits on
<PB N="viii" REF="9">one hand, on this attempt to become an author, but my own apprehen&s;ions depre&s;s them on the other, and it is with much tre|pidation I am prevailed on to ri&s;k my recep|tion with the public.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> On the Di&s;ea&s;es of early Pregnancy.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Section may de&s;erve the attention of women who are con&s;titutionally afflicted with trouble&s;ome complaints in the fir&s;t months of preg|nancy. The mo&s;t common &s;ymptoms of breeding are, &s;ickne&s;s, loathing, vomiting, giddine&s;s, drow&s;i|ne&s;s, heartburn, diarrhoea, a painful fulne&s;s of the brea&s;ts, nervous fits, faintings, &amp;c. If the patient is healthy, or of a full habit, it may be u&s;eful for her to let blood repeatedly, in &s;mall quantities, not exceeding &s;ix or &s;even ounces at a time, e&s;pecially if the &s;ickne&s;s is attended with flu&s;hings, parched mouth, or any other feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms; larger evacuations are not &s;afe. The bowels in &s;uch ca&s;es ought to be kept &s;oluble by ripe fruits, cooling diet, magne&s;ia, cream of tartar whey, &s;oluble tar|tar,
<PB N="10" REF="11">manna, or &s;uch gentle things, and yet more advantageou&s;ly by oily or emollient cly&s;ters; an u&s;eful dome&s;tic injection may be made in a few minutes thus:&mdash;Take of &s;trained gruel, about three quarters of a pint, brown &s;ugar, one ounce, Ca&s;tile &s;oap, half an ounce, &s;alad oil, two ounces; this, or &s;omething like it, may be thrown up occa&s;ionally. If frights or falls have done harm, the &s;ame treatment is recommended. When vomiting is trouble&s;ome, I have frequently known this &s;ymptom carried off by drinking chamomile tea, or giving two or three grains of ipeca|cuanha, to cau&s;e a di&s;charge of the offending matter from the &s;tomach. It may be remembered, as a general rule, that all &s;trong or violent remedies are hurtful, therefore, we caution again&s;t antimonials, mercurials, cathartics, jalap, aloes, or even rhubarb, becau&s;e it often cau&s;es griping pains. When ner|vous complaints come on, the mo&s;t effectual relief may be obtained from gentle opiates. If the pa|tient is delicate or weak, bleeding may do harm; but an invigorating diet in &s;mall quantities, and a little <HI>pure old wine,</HI> taken from time to time, may be u&s;eful. Much more may be &s;aid to make up a
<PB N="11" REF="12">book; if more is wanted, we recommend the advice of an experienced phy&s;ician; let it be remembered, I do not propo&s;e to trouble my readers with a large volume; my intention is only to give u&s;eful hints in a &s;hilling pamphlet; it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more on this part, but come in cour&s;e to our Second Section.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> On the Di&s;ea&s;es of advanced Pregnancy.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es of advanced pregnancy ought to be well under&s;tood by every midwife; for if ill treated, may be attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences. As pregnancy advances, the uterus increa&s;es in &s;ize, and pre&s;&s;es more and more heavily on the bowels, by which their important functions are impaired, the circulation of the blood, and the nervous in|fluence, are materially ob&s;tructed, what wonder then if di&s;agreeable effects often come from &s;uch cau&s;es?</P>
<P>Let us now mention &s;ome of the complaints that take place, and the be&s;t means of removing them. When the gravid uterus ri&s;es higher up into the abdomen, in the fifth, &s;ixth, or &s;eventh month of pregnancy, then commonly commences the com|plaints of advanced pregnancy, &s;uch as colics, cramps, hy&s;teric fits, pains in the back, difficulty of breathing, oedematous or watery &s;welling of the
<PB N="13" REF="14">legs, &amp;c. vomitings, convul&s;ions, difficulty or &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of urine, micturition, haemorrhoids, varicous &s;wellings in the veins of the legs, be&s;ides &s;ome others we &s;hall not mention. If colic torments the patient, let her have the inte&s;tines moderately emptied by gentle laxatives, lubricating cly&s;ters, or blood|letting, according to circum&s;tances, in ca&s;e &s;he is &s;trong or feveri&s;h, and co&s;tivene&s;s ought to be guarded again&s;t. If cramps are frequent, the &s;ame treatment may be u&s;eful; if they are &s;light, we have frequently known walking barefooted on the cold floor to give &s;peedy relief; when more unea&s;y, the following liniment will afford ca&s;e: take of tincture of opium, one ounce, of camphorated &s;pirit of wine, &s;ix drams, oil of amber, two drams, &s;pirit of ammonia, four drams, mix them, and let &s;ome of it be well rubbed occa&s;ionally on the parts affected. If piles are painful, the body mu&s;t be kept open as above, but we recommend ca&s;tor oil, if not offen&s;ive, for this purpo&s;e, one or two &s;poonsful is a moderate do&s;e; if the haemorrhoids are very un|ea&s;y, we recommend &s;trongly the following mixture and ointment: take of bal&s;am capivi, two drams, mucilage of gum arabic, one ounce, tincture of
<PB N="14" REF="15">columbo root, one ounce, &s;imple cinnamon water, two ounces, &s;irup of ginger, one ounce, mix them and give a de&s;ert &s;poonful thrice a day. The oint|ment may be depended on: take of gall nuts in fine powder, one ounce, pure verdigri&s;e powdered, two drams, hog's lard, two ounces, mix them to make an ointment, which may be applied to the &s;welled parts occa&s;ionally. When great difficulty of breathing attacks the patient, great relief may be procured from bleedings, and keeping the body &s;oluble. When a drop&s;y of the whole body, called ana&s;arca, comes on, it may proceed from laxity, and ought if po&s;&s;ible to be removed, without lo&s;s of time; we have little experience of this complaint, it &s;eldom occurs, yet we have heard much, but we believe that a &s;trengthening and warm &s;timulating diet is u&s;eful, with generous wine, but &s;pirits, watery meats, or fluids, are hurtful; after a &s;afe delivery, much may be done. If the fluor albus comes on, the &s;ame mode of treatment as in the drop&s;y may be recommended.</P>
<P>The oedematous, or watery &s;wellings of the lower extremities, &s;eldom come from the &s;ame cau&s;e as the
<PB N="15" REF="16">general drop&s;y, but entirely from the pre&s;ture of the gravid uterus, and though they are of little im|portance, yet it may be proper to dimini&s;h them, by bleeding, laxatives, a &s;pare opening diet, friction, and a horizontal po&s;ture. If the patient is weakly, cordials and a comfortable diet may be u&s;eful. Delivery contributes more than any thing to the cure. When varicous or di&s;tended &s;wellings of the veins become large and painful, they may be made ea&s;ier, by taking away occa&s;ionally &s;mall quantities of blood from the arm, and keeping the body open, becau&s;e they come from the pre&s;&s;ure of the gravid uterus. The be&s;t application to the parts is a &s;typtic or a&s;tringent water, which a venerable phy&s;i|cian of great experience a&s;&s;ures me is often very u&s;eful in varicous dilatations: take of blue vitriol and alum, of each three ounces, of water, two pints, boil them till the &s;alts are di&s;&s;olved, then filter the liquor, and add one ounce and a half of the vitriolic acid, and two drams of pure or refined verdigri&s;e, lay on the &s;welled veins compre&s;&s;es of linen, and bind them on with a tighti&s;h roller, and keep the&s;e compre&s;&s;es con&s;tantly moi&s;t with this &s;olution.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="17">
<P>We have &s;trongly recommended the frequent u&s;e of injections, to keep the body &s;oluble, and if we could per&s;uade tho&s;e for whom this little E&s;&s;ay is intended, to u&s;e the &s;elf-&s;yringe with their own hands, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tant, it might prevent the trouble of taking medicines, it would be le&s;s un|ea&s;y, le&s;s painful, le&s;s expen&s;ive, or di&s;agreeable, at the &s;ame time more delicate; but the&s;e are not all the advantages, a &s;yringe throws the cly&s;ter farther up than any other contrivance into the colon or great gut, where all the ob&s;tructed matter is de|tained, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the di&s;tended uterus on the os &s;acrum or rump bone.</P>
<P>We earne&s;tly recommend the introduction of the &s;elf-&s;yringe into every hou&s;e, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who have complaints in their bowels, about the anus, or are troubled with co&s;tivene&s;s. They may be purcha&s;ed in every con&s;iderable pewterer's &s;hop. I have been told, and I believe it implicitly, that there are many per&s;ons of both &s;exes, who with &s;ome he&s;itation took the&s;e machines into their hou&s;es, that now they under&s;tand how to u&s;e them, they would not part with them on any con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> The Qualities nece&s;&s;ary in an Accoucheur and an Accoucheu&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>HERE we will offer a few remarks on the quali|fications nece&s;&s;ary for an accoucheur, or rather let me de&s;cribe the &s;ort of accoucheur I would recom|mend. A man-midwife ought to be not younger than forty, not talkative, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much &s;agacity and prudence, naturally mode&s;t, benevolent and humane; in &s;hort, a gentleman, and withal have the reputation of being well educated. A midwife ought to be turned of thirty, clean, and neat in her per&s;on, plea&s;ant in her manners, gentle, at|tentive, and kind to her patients, by &s;upporting their &s;pirits in di&s;tre&s;s, civil to &s;ervants, but no|thing of a go&s;&s;ip, healthy and active, never taking &s;nuff, fond of children, &s;kilful and tender in handling new born infants, capable and ready to teach awkward nur&s;es how to dre&s;s or clean them, qualified to write &s;afe and u&s;eful pre&s;criptions for a morbid mother, or an ailing child; &s;he ought
<PB N="18" REF="19">to be a woman that hath been well in&s;tructed, that hath had much practice, not conceited, nor proud, nor vain, nor &s;uper&s;titious, but firm in her mind, plain, di&s;creet, and hone&s;t; a &s;incere friend in every family, always di&s;po&s;ed to call in to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance a phy&s;ician, or an experienced accoucheur, whenever there is any nece&s;&s;ity, or even a di&s;tant de&s;ire of &s;ome kind relation, for this will rai&s;e her reputation, prevent reflections, and demon&s;trate her di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The fa&s;hion of latter years hath taken the practice of midwifery almo&s;t entirely out of the hands of women, and placed it into tho&s;e of the men, and the rea&s;ons for it were obvious. Formerly every conceited go&s;&s;iping woman that cho&s;e to act as a midwife, began this profe&s;&s;ion, without in&s;truction, I had almo&s;t &s;aid without common &s;en&s;e, or any one requi&s;ite for &s;uch an important employment, and many notorious evils en&s;ued. Then the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons, being men &s;killed in phy&s;iology, re&s;cued many unfortunate patients from the fangs of igno|rant women, and it becoming a lucrative branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, they kept it &s;nug, till a numerous body in
<PB N="19" REF="20">the inferior departments, de&s;iring to &s;hare the pro|fits, came forth, like a hord of hungry untaught men, from the labours of the pe&s;tle and mortar, with a few hooks, forceps and crotchets, in a bag, like Dr. Slop, they call them&s;elves accoucheurs, or men-midwives, but for ob&s;tetric knowledge, we have &s;een &s;ome of them as ignorant as me&s;&s;engers of the contents of their di&s;patches, yet &s;ome of the&s;e men have arrived at eminence, or rather have ac|quired exten&s;ive practice and fortunes, but in ca&s;es of difficulty, they are as awkward as any of the mo&s;t ignorant female practitioners. Women often em|ploy men to act as midwives, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that they mu&s;t know more than the women mid-wives; but this, like many other &s;uppo&s;itions, may frequently have no real foundation in truth.</P>

<HEAD>Seme Rea&s;ons offered why Women are preferable to Men as Midwives.</HEAD>
<P>There are many women who cannot conver&s;e ea&s;ily or freely with a man, on many circum&s;tances that happen about the time of parturition, or even on &s;ome &s;exual di&s;orders, this may be called fal&s;e mo|de&s;ty, but &s;till it exi&s;ts and cau&s;es many evils; here we &s;uppo&s;e &s;kilful women might be more agree|able and u&s;eful. One of the fir&s;t phy&s;icians in the city, who I believe to be my friend, &s;aid to me one day, lately, that if clever women would dili|gently &s;tudy to accompli&s;h them&s;elves in midwifery, he would wi&s;h for the &s;ake of propriety, and the good of mankind, that this profe&s;&s;ion was again re&s;tored to female hands. It is the opinion of many learned phy&s;icians, that the advantages to the &s;ex are &s;mall, if any, by the over grown number of male practitioners, at the &s;ame time, they are clearly of opinion, that a number of eminent accoucheurs &s;hould be &s;elected and appointed to give advice both to ordinary men and women midwives in difficult and preternatural ca&s;es. It is fortunate for us, few, very few parturient females, not one in
<PB N="24" REF="25">many hundreds, need be under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in an accoucheur. Indeed, the numbers of women who are delivered with little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, may convince us how much nature acteth in the&s;e ca&s;es for our advantage. In the ob&s;tetric art, as well as in other branches of the &s;cience of healing, it might be better if we could wait patiently, and would humbly rate our&s;elves as the handmaids of nature. Premature practitioners, are apt, like the philo&s;o|pher in Ra&s;&s;elas, to &s;uppo&s;e they can govern the na|tural cour&s;e of things, but after a few trials, they mu&s;t find out their incapacity; a little mode&s;ty and common &s;en&s;e, may point out their errors, but con|ceited young men and ignorant women are &s;eldom ea&s;ily reclaimed from forwardne&s;s, therefore, pru|dence ought to induce us to have recour&s;e when we can, to intelligent practitioners.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> On the Care of Children.</HEAD>
<P>INFANTS often &s;uffer much from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, ignorance, or officiou&s;ne&s;s of nur&s;es; to prevent this, it is the duty of an intelligent midwife to ca&s;t a careful eye over their conduct, a little con&s;cientious pains ought to be be&s;towed upon it; cleanline&s;s is a mo&s;t important article, the infant ought to be wa&s;hed twice a day in lukewarm water; it is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom in the South of Europe, even in &s;ummer, for if per&s;piration or any other excrementi|tious matter is left on their tender &s;kins, it will &s;oon become acrid, cau&s;e inflammation, excoriation, and con&s;equently much unea&s;ine&s;s; this is not writ|ten from a fine &s;pun theory, but is the re&s;ult of ex|perience. We are of opinion, that wa&s;hing of ten|der infants in lukewarm water, is greatly preferable to cold water, and that the theory of relaxation is here more imaginary than real, and that experience confirms this doctrine. If from neglect, the &s;kin of infants becomes inflamed or excoriated, let the
<PB N="26" REF="27">parts be well wa&s;hed, and made dry, then du&s;t on a little powdered white lead from a mu&s;lin cloth, this is &s;imple but effectual, but let the ceru&s;&s;a, or powder of lead, be removed &s;o as not to go near their victuals.</P>
<P>An intelligent midwife that hath as much, perhaps more experience, and I believe hath had better opportunities of in&s;truction, than any other in this city, from the repetition of lectures, hath emphatically de&s;ired me to mention, in my pamphlet, that if infants are kept dry and clean, their tempers and di&s;po&s;itions will be more plea|&s;ant; they will &s;eldom be liable to rickets, or any of tho&s;e di&s;orders that affect the bones, &s;o as to cau&s;e bandy legs, &amp;c. and that when female in|fants are neglected in the&s;e articles, the bones of the pelvis, or lowe&s;t part of the body, are often &s;oftened and dimini&s;hed in their natural capacity, &s;o as when adults, the di&s;torted pelvis cannot admit a child to pa&s;s ea&s;ily, and from thence proceedeth the rea&s;on for inventing of &s;o many iron in&s;truments to faciliate difficult labours, and to give occa&s;ion to bold operators to try their hands; moreover, this gentlewoman adds, that if it were not for the
<PB N="27" REF="28">neglect of cleanline&s;s in infancy, many men and women would be &s;tronger in their loins, better pro|portioned in their limbs, more healthy, and move more gracefully, but above all, there would be rarely any cau&s;e to call in even the prudent and experienced accoucher to a&s;&s;i&s;t in parturition; let me add, that the&s;e ob&s;ervations are confirmed by the opinions of practical men, who&s;e judgments are not apocryphal. An attention to this doctrine can never do harm, and nur&s;es, who con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;charge their duty, de&s;erve rewards and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, that wet nur&s;es have not enough of milk for their nur&s;elings, and make up their food with bread, tapioca, or Indian arrow root, and the common milk of this town; we be|lieve, that in general, beef tea, mutton or veal broth, mixed with them, is preferable. Infants are liable to acidity in the &s;tomach and guts, which often occa&s;ions griping, purging, &amp;c. a little magne&s;ia given occa&s;ionally is the be&s;t dome&s;tic re|medy. If co&s;tivene&s;s at any time comes on, a little manna, or, when very young, a few tea-&s;poonsful of equal parts of fre&s;h oil of almonds and &s;yrup of
<PB N="28" REF="29">violets, repeated occa&s;ionally, is a &s;afe and u&s;eful laxative. If vomiting from foul matter in the &s;to|mach is trouble&s;ome, one or two grains of the pow|der of ipecacuan may be given as an emetic, with &s;afety, and &s;ometimes, two or three tea &s;poonsful of wine, and &s;ome warm water, by way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the evacuation, will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; if more is wanted, the be&s;t way is to apply &s;oon for proper advice.</P>
<P>In childrens di&s;ea&s;es, much may be done by li|beral well informed women; in di&s;ea&s;es of the bow|els, diarrhoea, or flux of the belly, vomitings, worms, hooping coughs, &amp;c. rational women may be more in the way of examining their evacuations, and prying into particular complaints, and naturally attend more to their di&s;order, than either the learned phy&s;ician, or the &s;kilful apothecary, who&s;e longe&s;t vi&s;its la&s;t only a few minutes, and then are told the &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances by &s;ome indi&s;tinct at|tendant, that knows le&s;s than &s;he pretends to do; thus a child is often lo&s;t in the hands of able men. Even, when children are ill in the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, fever, fits, &amp;c. they are often totally tru&s;ted
<PB N="29" REF="30">to the care of very ignorant, pretending old women, who know as little of the&s;e di&s;orders, as I do of the French Directory, or the Iri&s;h Rebellion. Would it not be better, to find out &s;ome intelligent per&s;on, who can and will give attention to them? It is true, &s;ome do recover in &s;pite of bad treatment, but, if they die, are not the parents blameable for over|looking &s;o important a concern? If &s;ome women can be found fit for all the important duties of a midwife, and of giving &s;ound advice in &s;exual di&s;orders, or in tho&s;e of children, why he&s;itate to employ them? Are women by nature incapable of in&s;truction, or are they deficient in &s;agacity to be u&s;eful? Cu&s;tom or fa&s;hion govern the world, and often deprives us of that judgment, or common &s;en&s;e, that would be more advantageous to &s;ociety. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, I wi&s;h to reject the advice of able men, far from it, I wi&s;h only to demon&s;trate that women may be capable of being very u&s;eful in &s;exual di&s;orders, as well as in tho&s;e of children; it &s;eems to me as if nature had allotted this part of the healing art to females, becau&s;e we have better opportunities of inve&s;tigating the real &s;tate of the illne&s;s, and if benevolently a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;agacious phy&s;icians, might &s;ave many lives.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<P>There hath been &s;ome conjectures agitated among men of no mean con&s;ideration, fal&s;e or true, I leave to others to determine; they have &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ince women of all ranks, gave them&s;elves up to men|midwives, they have lo&s;t much of that delicacy, which before rendered them &s;o amiable, and in lo&s;ing delicacy, &s;ay they, may not cha&s;tity it&s;elf be ea&s;ily violated? If we lo&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of either, or both, what are we? Others &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ince that period, more elopements, trials for crim. con. divorces, pri|vate intrigues among married women, have been com|mon, and that we have acquired more of a ma&s;cu|line &s;wing in our gait. Some men of gallantry have not &s;crupled to &s;ay, that women who employ men|midwives, are in general, an ea&s;ier prey than tho&s;e who do not. It is &s;tep by &s;tep, or &s;low advances, that women commonly arrive at vice, ju&s;t &s;o, do thoughtle&s;s boys become cruel, by being &s;uffered to torment birds, bea&s;ts, reptiles, in&s;ects, &amp;c. by and by, they lo&s;e every feeling of humanity, and can murder men without horror. If we could but be cautious to defend our&s;elves again&s;t the approach of all impropriety, the ladies of Britain would be as &s;uperior in virtue as they are in beauty. <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

<HEAD>A comparative Review of Male and Female Temperaments.</HEAD>
<P>Females, when young, may at lea&s;t claim equal e&s;teem with their brothers, the lords of creation, for filial affection, and all the virtues of parental obedience; as wives, men of great ob&s;ervation have given te&s;timony in their writings, that we are by no means inferior to our hu&s;bands in conjugal duties.</P>
<P>As mothers, I have &s;till the te&s;timony of men, that we are full as tender and careful of our chil|dren as their fathers are; as mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of fami|lies, are we not equally economical, as kind to our &s;ervants, and benevolent to the poor? Authors of the mo&s;t eminent abilities, after a comparative review of both &s;exes, have candidly declared, upon the whole, we are by no means inferior, or rather we are &s;uperior, in acting our parts in all the con|cerns of life. All the&s;e commendations we can re|ceive with con&s;cious pride, while we merit them, but when we part with delicacy or mode&s;ty, alas! how are we fallen! even, like a flower after it is cropt, &s;oon lo&s;eth all its &s;weetne&s;s, and is ca&s;t like a loath&s;ome weed away. I wi&s;h my amiable readers
<PB N="32" REF="33">may con&s;ider here what I have &s;aid, both in a moral, and a religious point of view; it can do them no harm, and if the thinking part of men can al&s;o agree with me, it may be an object worthy of their atten|tion, to le&s;&s;en, or do away one of the greate&s;t cau&s;es of our misfortunes and unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that female education was more &s;o|licitou&s;ly attended to. When young, we often have a bad education, which is wor&s;e than none; &s;o by imitation, from bad examples, of ea&s;e, free|dom, fa&s;hion, grace, &amp;c. in&s;en&s;ibly we lo&s;e the elegant &s;weetne&s;s of female delicacy and re&s;erve. I am always happy to &s;ee young ladies exhibit ex|cellence in the dance, to hear the charms of mu&s;ic from their well-toned in&s;truments, or tran&s;ported by the melting &s;ounds of the voice, and to behold their ta&s;te in drawing; but I am &s;ometimes &s;orry to find, that the&s;e accompli&s;hed young ladies are ignorant of the grammar of their own language, that they are deficient in under&s;tanding the fir&s;t principles of virtue, and that they have had no in&s;truction on the holy &s;criptures; the fir&s;t of the&s;e two la&s;t, may &s;hew them the beauty and felicity of moral conduct, and
<PB N="33" REF="34">the &s;econd, the eternal bli&s;s, that is promi&s;ed us, in &s;tudying the laws of our Almighty Cre|ator, or Redeemer; and I will venture to a&s;&s;ure my fair readers, that by &s;tudying carefully the&s;e &s;acred laws, &s;o as to practi&s;e them as &s;trictly as po&s;&s;ible, they will find continually that &s;atisfaction in their minds, that will give cheerfulne&s;s to their features, that will beautify their beauty; be&s;ides, if the day of adver&s;ity &s;hould overtake us, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done our duty, will feel to afflicted minds as a &s;ource of cele&s;tial con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I am a mother my&s;elf, and it is on the&s;e prin|ciples I endeavour to in&s;truct my children. If I dared, as a female writer, I would venture to re|commend to young ladies of fa&s;hion, &s;ome attention to hi&s;tory, geography, botany, natural hi&s;tory, mo|ral and natural philo&s;ophy, &amp;c. the&s;e might occupy any blank in their minds, and make them capa|ble to carry on agreeable conver&s;ations on any &s;ub|ject; this would make them admired by all their ac|quaintances, and adored by their hu&s;bands, it would render their actions more graceful, and their beauty more plea&s;ing; it would make religion more rational, by opening their ey&eacute;s to the power and goodne&s;s of the Almighty in all his works.</P>

<P>IT may be ob&s;erved by &s;ome, that I have been &s;ilent on three mo&s;t important parts of midwifery, Abortion, Uterine-hemorrhage, and the Puerperal fever; the&s;e have been ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by more intelligent writers, therefore, I purpo&s;ely pa&s;&s;ed them over, but I may venture the&s;e ob&s;er|vations, that Abortion when well treated, is &s;eldom attended with any danger; that Uterine-hemorrhage almo&s;t always requires great attention, &s;kill, and &s;agacity, to prevent dan|ger; and as to the Puerperal &s;ever, as it is a complicated di&s;ea&s;e, of a mortal tendency, we recommend it to the care of the intelligent and experienced phy&s;ician, either to pre|vent or to cure it.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my little work, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome friends, much more intelligent than my&s;elf, they de&s;ire me to add, by way of po&s;t-&s;cript, that I intend to practi&s;e midwifery, being entitled to it by my liberal cer|tificates, from the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons of the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital, in Brownlow-&s;treet; to whom, for their goodne&s;s and able in&s;tructions, I &s;hall always feel the &s;in|cere&s;t obligations; and to the intelligent matrons of that u&s;eful charity, I al&s;o offer my hone&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
