<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Marks, Characters, and Symptoms, which di&s;tingui&s;h that branch of the Ve|nereal Di&s;ea&s;e, called a Virulent Gonor|rhaea, or Clap.</HEAD>
<P>AS this &s;pecies of the Venereal Di|&s;ea&s;e is very frequently met with in practice, I &s;hall take all po&s;&s;ible care to lay before the reader, every circum|&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary to give him a ju&s;t idea of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ince upon the right manage|ment of this branch may, perhaps, depend his future peace, happine&s;s, and welfare.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<P>A Virulent Gonorrhaea or Clap, is a di&s;|charge of corrupted matter, either from the glands of the urethra in men, or the vagina in women, occa&s;ioned from their having to do with an infected per&s;on. The quantity is always in proportion to the degree of the irritation, the quality, to the degree of malignity in the infectious matter, received from the infected per&s;on, in coition.</P>
<P>After a man has had to do with an infect|ed per&s;on, he &s;ome time after perceives an itching in his yard, near the nut, and a kind of rotation of the te&s;ticles, a day or two after, the parts begin to &s;hoot, and burn, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt when he makes water, which is attended with a &s;calding heat, &s;oon after, a running en&s;ues, which is com|monly of a cream colour. This is the fir&s;t &s;tage of a virulent gonorrhaea, and nothing can be ea&s;ier of cure than a clap thus cir|cum&s;tanced; but when the foregoing &s;ymp|toms are either &s;uffered to continue, or the infection is extremely virulent, the&s;e addi|tional &s;ymptoms en&s;ue; &s;mall ulcers, called &s;hancres, and pocky-warts, di&s;cover them|&s;elves upon the nut or fore-&s;kin: the fore|&s;kin is &s;o &s;welled that it cannot be forced back over the nut, which is called a phy|mo&s;is. The running is di&s;charged in larger quantities, and tinges the linnen of a yel|low
<PB N="3" REF="7">or green colour. The pain in making water becomes more violent, and a pain is felt in the yard at every erection, as if it were violently &s;queezed with the hand, which &s;ymptom happens chiefly when the per&s;on grows warm in bed, and is called a chor|dee. But when the running is re&s;trained, or blocked up, either from the virulence of the infection, the patients catching cold, or the improper u&s;e of a&s;tringent medi|cines either internally, or by way of injec|tion, the te&s;ticles become &s;welled, hard, and extremely painful, and &s;ometimes an ab&s;ce&s;s is formed in the urinary pa&s;&s;age, which becoming fi&s;tulous, di&s;charges a very virulent &s;anies, and is called by &s;ur|geons a fi&s;tula in perinoeo.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Some con&s;iderations concerning the manage|ment of the diet, and exerci&s;e, in the cure of a virulent Gonorrhaea or Clap.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL di&s;tingui&s;h the aliments mo&s;t proper in the cure of a virulent Clap, in|to three kinds: fir&s;t, tho&s;e that are mo&s;t proper to temperate the Venereal Virus, to abate the inflammation of the parts, and ea&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="8">the &s;calding heat of urine: for this purpo&s;e I advi&s;e the patient for the fir&s;t week or ten days to have for breakfa&s;t, thin milk-pottage, a me&s;s of &s;ego, or two or three di&s;hes of tea, with a &s;lice or two of bread and butter; for dinner a bread-pudding, chicken, veal, or mutton-broth; and of ve|getables, turnips, potatoes, and par&s;nips; and by all means to avoid fle&s;h meats for the fir&s;t week at lea&s;t: new milk from the cow affords excellent nouri&s;hment, and is both clean&s;ing and cooling to the body, and therefore a me&s;s in the evening will be a very proper &s;upper. For con&s;tant drink, I advi&s;e weak wine and water, or &s;mall beer.</P>
<P>After the virulence is de&s;troyed and the matter begins to be of a better colour and con&s;i&s;tence, I then advi&s;e a more &s;ub&s;tan|tial diet, <HI>viz.</HI> chickens, veal, lamb, rab|bits, rice-puddings, rice-milk, chocolate, hart&s;horn-jellies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which cool the body, thicken the juices, and le&s;&s;en the &s;ecretions, and con&s;equently the di&s;charge of the ve|nereal running.</P>
<P>When the running is greatly le&s;&s;ened and become quite ropy, and the pain entirely abated, I add to the foregoing diet, &s;ea bi&s;cuits, or Jew's cakes, jarr-rai&s;ins, millet|puddings, and hart&s;horn-jellies, which &s;trengthen much; for a diet of this kind
<PB N="5" REF="9">gives great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the admini&s;tration of &s;trengthning medicines where they are judged proper to &s;top the running, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e in &s;tubborn gleets; but if (as is frequently the ca&s;e) the patient's &s;ituation in life will not allow him to ad|here punctually to the&s;e rules, yet as he values his future health and welfare, let him avoid all &s;alt meats, as pickled pork, hams, &s;alt beef, and the like; for &s;alts of all kinds heighten the inflammation, increa&s;e the virulency, and greatly lengthen the cure of the running, 'till the di&s;ea&s;e either changes into a Pox, or is attended with an incur|able gleet, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons he mu&s;t avoid too great an indulgence of all reli&s;h|ing acids, rich &s;auces, and &s;pirituous li|quors, as things of the mo&s;t pernicious na|ture to tho&s;e that labour under a virulent clap.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e in a clap while the di&s;ea&s;e is re|cent, mu&s;t frequently be attended with very bad con&s;equences, for by violent mo|tion the body is heated, and the blood in|flamed, whereby both the pain, &s;calding of the urine, and virulence of the running are increa&s;ed; therefore I would advi&s;e the patient during the fir&s;t fortnight or three weeks of his cure, to avoid riding, much walking, jumping, and the like, which exa&s;perate the &s;ymptoms very much, and to
<PB N="6" REF="10">keep him&s;elf as &s;till as po&s;&s;ible; for by this means the parts will recover their former tone, &s;trength, and vigour, in a much &s;horter time.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, when only a weakne&s;s of the parts, and a gleety weeping remains, I advi&s;e the moderate u&s;e of the cold-bath, which is a remedy I pre|fer to all others, for it braces up the nerves, con&s;olidates the broken fibres of the ure|thra, and &s;trengthens and re&s;tores the tone of the genitals.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of experiencing the benefit of cold bathing, ought in the morning fa&s;ting to plunge over head, and to continue no longer under water than they can bear to hold their breath; for it is the fir&s;t &s;hock that gives the mo&s;t vigo|rous contraction to all the mu&s;cular and nervous fibres, whereby their due &s;pringi|ne&s;s and action are re&s;tored. But before the patient makes trial of the efficacy of this remedy, he ought to be perfectly &s;atis|fied that the virulency of the clap is totally de&s;troyed; otherwi&s;e, by un&s;ea&s;onable bracing up the fibres, he will only tie up the pocky venom upon the habit, which in time will get into the blood, taint the juices, and produce a confirmed pox.</P>
<P>But above all, the patient mu&s;t be care|ful to moderate his pa&s;&s;ions, wanton pic|tures,
<PB N="7" REF="11">la&s;civious books, and amorous dal|liances with women, mu&s;t be &s;hunned, for the &s;ame ill effects will certainly follow the&s;e, as all other debauches, &s;ince they heat the body, rai&s;e the pul&s;e, and occa|&s;ion a larger di&s;charge by the part affected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> To e&s;tabli&s;h the cure of a virulent Clap, upon the cleare&s;t principles of practice: I pro|po&s;e to reduce the &s;everal curative indications under the three following heads: fir&s;t, I &s;hall lay down the mo&s;t proper methods to a&s;&s;wage the venereal &s;ymptoms, by medicines that correct and purge off the infectious venom. Secondly, I &s;hall attempt to re|&s;train the running, by tho&s;e means that I have always known to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, even in the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate ca&s;es: And la&s;tly, I &s;hall lay down the choice&s;t rules to relieve the weakne&s;s of the con&s;titution, and re&s;tore the affected parts to their former tone and vigour.</HEAD>
<P>TO accompli&s;h the fir&s;t general indi|cation, as an inten&s;e heat, pain, and inflammation of the yard, are always pre&s;ent &s;ymptoms of a fre&s;h contracted clap, no|thing
<PB N="8" REF="12">is preferable to the following method, to correct the venom, and relieve the in|flammation and other &s;ymptoms. The cure mu&s;t be begun with bleeding plentifully in the arm, which may be repeated according to the &s;trength of the patient, and the vio|lence of the inflammation. After bleeding, the patient mu&s;t take the following apozem every morning for five or &s;ix days.</P>
<P>Take Ep&s;om water two pints and an half, &s;crape a little nutmeg into it, and boil it over a gentle fire 'till it comes to a quart, then di&s;&s;olve in it an ounce of manna, and half an ounce of glaubers-&s;alt, and &s;train it off for u&s;e: half a pint of this is to be taken milk-warm every half hour 'till the whole quantity is taken. During the u&s;e of the above medicine, the patient mu&s;t drink plentifully between whiles, of barley-water, milk and water, capillaire, or any other cooling liquor. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how this innocent remedy cools the pa&s;&s;ages, and relieves the heat and &s;mart of urine,</P>
<P>After having made u&s;e of the foregoing apozem for four or five days, I would re|commend the patient to take two of the following mercurial pills, every night and morning, or according to the operation, one only every night and morning, for a week or ten days, unle&s;s the patient com|plains
<PB N="9" REF="13">of his gums, or a &s;ore mouth, in which ca&s;e the&s;e pills mu&s;t be left off for a few days, and the quantity of a nutmeg of the purging electuary, which I &s;hall give the receipt of, mu&s;t be taken in their room 'till the &s;ore mouth is entirely removed, when the patient may again take two of the pills every night only, and the next morn|ing a do&s;e of the electuary, which method he mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in 'till the quantity of the running grows le&s;s, and feels more thick and ropy, when he mu&s;t leave off the pills and continue the u&s;e of the electuary only, every night and morning, for a few days longer.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Receipt for making the Mercurial Pills.</HEAD>
<P>Take two drachms of quick-&s;ilver, and rub it with a &s;ufficient quantity of turpen|tine 'till it is entirely killed, then add a drachm of powder of gum guaicum, and half a drachm of the colocynth pill with aloes, mix them well together, and divide the ma&s;s into twenty-four pills, two of which are to be taken every night and morning.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Receipt for the purging Electuary.</HEAD>
<P>Take of the be&s;t honey an ounce and an half, bal&s;am of copaiva three quarters of an ounce, powder of jalap, and &s;alt pru|nella,
<PB N="10" REF="14">of each a drachm, mix them toge|ther into an electuary: the do&s;e of which is the quantity of a nutmeg, every night and morning. If this electuary purges too much, the powder of jalap mu&s;t be left out, and a drachm of powder of rhubarb is to be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>When by the u&s;e of the medicines al|ready pre&s;cribed, the pain in making water and the chordee are entirely removed, and the running from a greeni&s;h or yellowi&s;h colour, has changed to a thick white mat|ter, and is very ropy, and but in &s;mall quantity. The cure mu&s;t be compleated by taking twenty drops of bal&s;am copaiva in a tea &s;poonful of powdered &s;ugar, three times in a day, or by taking two or three of the following &s;trengthning pills, every night and morning.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Receipt for making the &s;trengthning Pills.</HEAD>
<P>Take boiled turpentine half an ounce, powder of rhubarb three drachms, balm of gilead twenty drops; beat them together, and divide the ma&s;s into middle &s;ized pills, two or three of which are to be taken eve|ry night and morning.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we have ob&s;erved that the changing of the colour of the running from yellow to white, was a certain mark of the virulence being entirely de&s;troyed,
<PB N="11" REF="15">yet the reader is de&s;ired to take notice, that in per&s;ons advanced in years, and tho&s;e who have had &s;everal claps; this change of co|lour can &s;eldom be effected, &s;o that the running continues of a pale yellow, or light green to the la&s;t, though you &s;hould continue the u&s;e of the purging medicines ever &s;o long, you will never be able to change the colour of the running, but may very much impair the con&s;titution by pur|&s;uing this method; in this ca&s;e therefore, provided the running is of a good con&s;i&s;t|ence, the inflammation, &s;mart of urine, and chordee entirely gone off, and the yard &s;o entirely free from all pain, that you can &s;queeze it &s;omewhat roughly without more &s;orene&s;s than what is u&s;ual from a rude handling of this member naturally, you may &s;afely proceed to &s;uppre&s;s the gleet by the u&s;e of the bal&s;am copaiva, and the &s;trengthning pills, though the colour of the running does not appear altogether &s;o fa|vourable as might be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>If the means hitherto pre&s;cribed &s;hould prove in&s;ufficient, and though the virulency is perfectly cured, a running &s;hould &s;till remain, even after having per&s;i&s;ted in the u&s;e of the &s;trengthning pills, for &s;ome time, the di&s;order is then called a gleet, and mu&s;t be treated as will be &s;hewn hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>Of the cure of the Chordee.</HEAD>
<P>If the chordee does not readily give way to the u&s;e of the mercurial pills and purg|ing electuary, the relief will be mo&s;t &s;peedi|ly effected by pur&s;uing the following me|thod,</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Bleed in the arm to the amount of eight or ten ounces,</HEAD>
<P>Take elder flowers one handful and an half, chamomile-flowers and mallow-leaves, each one handful, boil them over a gentle fire, in three pints of water to a pint and an half, which &s;train off for u&s;e. Foment the parts with this of a moderate warmth fre|quently, 'till the part grows &s;upple, after which apply to the whole body of the yard a little warm, and carefully kept on with a proper bandage, the following pultice. Take lin&s;eed-flower and bean-flower, each half an handful, ointment of mar&s;hmallows half an ounce, make them into a pultice with a little of the fomentation liquor.</P>
<P>But if the patient cannot conveniently make u&s;e of the above fomentation, and pultice, a drachm of weak mercurial oint|ment mu&s;t be well rubbed in on the whole under part of the yard, every other night.</P>

<HEAD>Cure of the Hernia Humouralis, or &s;welling of the Te&s;ticles.</HEAD>
<P>The cure of this di&s;order mu&s;t be begun with bleeding to the amount of ten or twelve ounces, then let a bag tru&s;s, which may be had of Mr. White, Tru&s;s-maker in Fleet-&s;treet, be got, for the &s;upport of the &s;welled cods, and let the following pultice be applied every night and morning.</P>
<P>Take the crumb of &s;tale rolls, and boil them with a &s;ufficient quantity of new milk, to the con&s;i&s;tence of a pultice, to which add half an ounce of ointment of elder-flowers.</P>

<HEAD>Cure of the Bubo, or venereal &s;welling in the Groin.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ign of a venereal bubo, is a dull heavy pain in the groin, ari&s;ing from an ob|&s;truction of the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, which
<PB N="16" REF="20">cau&s;es little knots and kernels at fir&s;t, but the pain continuing to encrea&s;e, the &s;well|ing grows as large as a pidgeon's egg, &s;ome|times much larger, and the part is &s;ome|times inflamed, and the &s;kin changes to a red colour.</P>
<P>There are two methods recommended for the cure of this &s;ymptom of the vene|real di&s;ea&s;e, the one, by di&s;per&s;ing the bu|bo before it comes to &s;uppurate, by the u&s;e of mercurials, and purges, which, as it re|quires no manual operation, is &s;horter, more free from pain, and equally &s;afe, therefore has ju&s;tly the preference.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="treatment">
<HEAD>The method is as follows.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, let eight or ten ounces of blood be taken from the arm, then apply a mercurial plai&s;ter &s;pread thick on leather, the &s;ize of the &s;welling: this need not be changed oftner than once in four days. Take in|wardly the mercurial pill, directed under the article of chancres, every night going to re&s;t, and continue the u&s;e of it 'till the mouth grows hot, and the gums begin to &s;well, and a &s;pitting &s;eems to be coming on; but as &s;oon as this happens, the mer|curial pill mu&s;t be immediately left off, and the purging pills, directed under the ar|ticle of chancres, mu&s;t be taken every morn|ing, or every other morning, according to
<PB N="17" REF="21">the &s;trength of the patient, 'till the &s;ore|ne&s;s of the mouth and &s;pitting are entirely gone off, after which you mu&s;t take the mercurial pill in the manner already direct|ed, 'till the mouth again grows &s;ore, when the &s;pitting mu&s;t be re&s;trained by the purg|ing-pills as before. This cour&s;e mu&s;t be pur&s;ued 'till the &s;welling di&s;appears. To prevent a relap&s;e, a quart of &s;trong &s;a&s;&s;a|fras-tea &s;hould be taken every day for a fortnight or three weeks. The diet &s;hould be very low and &s;paring, and the &s;ick per|&s;on &s;hould be very warmly cloathed, and great care taken to prevent catching cold. The other method of cure by promoting a &s;uppuration, I &s;hall omit giving any account of in this treati&s;e, as in that ca&s;e, it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice of a &s;kilful Surgeon.</P>

<HEAD>PART SECOND. OF THE GRAND OR FRENCH POX.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former part I have &s;o fully treat|ed of every thing that relates to the cure of a virulent clap, that I cannot re|collect any material circum&s;tance omitted, which might be judged nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of that branch of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e: For the reader will perceive, that I have not only given the proper methods to re|lieve the mo&s;t inveterate &s;ymptoms of a clap, but al&s;o the mo&s;t effectual means to re&s;tore the con&s;titution to its former &s;trength, and the &s;uffering parts to their for|mer tone and vigour.</P>
<P>Having therefore accompli&s;hed every thing nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of a clap, I &s;hall proceed to treat of all the particular circum&s;tances of the Second Infection, or French Pox, from the fir&s;t and &s;lighte&s;t attack it makes upon the con&s;titution, to its la&s;t and mo&s;t deplorable &s;ymptoms, where the di&s;ea&s;e becomes univer&s;al, and the patient too frequently &s;inks under the mo&s;t excruciating tortures.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="28">
<P>When the venereal di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared in Europe, it was reputed epidemic and contagious, but it is now known by un|doubted experience, and the unanimous con&s;ent of phy&s;icians, that it can neither be contracted by any error in diet, the fault of the air, or any &s;pontaneous corruption of the humours, but &s;olely by infection, and the communication of it from one that is di&s;ea&s;ed. It is therefore mo&s;tly if not &s;olely communicated by the immediate con|tact of one di&s;ea&s;ed, with &s;ome part of a &s;ound per&s;on, as by coition, by the brea&s;t, by lewd ki&s;&s;ing, by introducing the finger into the places infected by a venereal ulcer or flux, if there happens to be a hang-nail on the finger, or &s;ome little cut or era&s;e|ment of the &s;kin. It al&s;o often ari&s;es from the long continuance of a virulent clap, the un&s;ea&s;onable u&s;e of a&s;tringents, or the un&s;kilful application of &s;typtic injections, whereby the pocky venom that ought to di&s;charge it&s;elf through the urinary pa&s;&s;age in form of a running, is too ha&s;tily &s;up|pre&s;t, and the in&s;ectious matter is thrown upon the con&s;titution, and infects the blood and juices.</P>
<P>The difference of the &s;ymptoms have a great dependance upon the influence of the pocky venom, whereby they are either mild, corro&s;ive, or extremely malignant,
<PB N="25" REF="29">though &s;ometimes the vicious juices of the body occa&s;ion a variety of untoward &s;ymp|toms, even in ca&s;es where originally the pocky venom was very mild; this happens in bodies highly &s;corbutic, that live much upon high &s;ea&s;oned meats, rich wines, and other hot inflammatory diet, which fire the blood, &s;harpen the humours, and ren|der the pocky &s;ymptoms more corro&s;ive and malignant.</P>
<P>The &s;afety or danger of the patient very much depends upon the greatne&s;s or &s;eve|rity of the &s;ymptoms, the multitude of the parts affected, and the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e parts to life. When the &s;ymptoms are few, and do not affect the parts e&s;&s;ential to life, provided the venereal venom does not lay hold of the bones, we may judge the cure will be ea&s;ily and &s;peedily effected. A more favourable i&s;&s;ue may be expected from a pox attended with a virulent running, than from a dry pox, without that circum&s;tance attending it: as al&s;o from a pox contract|ed in youth, than in old people. It is al|ways a good &s;ign and promi&s;es well to the patient, where the &s;cabs and breaking-out appear full on the habit, and their heads ri&s;e with an eminence above the &s;kin, and the want of vital force is the &s;ole rea&s;on why this di&s;ea&s;e &s;o frequently terminates in
<PB N="26" REF="30">the &s;curvy, a&s;thma, or drop&s;y in aged people.</P>
<P>The cure of an hereditary pox is very dif|ficult, but not impo&s;&s;ible, the &s;ame may be concluded of an infant, that &s;uckles an in|fected nur&s;e. A pox of long &s;tanding in a &s;trong, healthful young man, is ea&s;ier to cure than a fre&s;h pox in a weakly, &s;corbutic, or hectical con&s;titution, though an invete|rate pox is very trouble&s;ome and difficult to relieve, even under the be&s;t con&s;titu|tions.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="indications">
<HEAD>Signs of the &s;econd Infection or grand Pox.</HEAD>
<P>Buboes in the groin, and chancres on the private parts make the fir&s;t degree of this di&s;temper. The &s;kin e&s;pecially about the neck and brea&s;t, and between the &s;houlders is covered with flat &s;pots like freckles, of a yellow or livid colour, it is full of itchy pu&s;tules, tetters, ringworms and &s;erpigi|nous eruptions. There are chaps in the palms of the hands and &s;oles of the feet, with itching, from whence proceeds a clear liquor like water: it abounds with hard, callous, round pu&s;tules, ri&s;ing a little at the top, generally dry, but &s;ometimes moi&s;t, &s;caly, branny, and yellow, frequently on the corners of the lips, and the &s;ides of the no&s;trils, but more e&s;pecially on the fore|head, temples, and behind the ears, where
<PB N="27" REF="31">they appear in rows like a &s;tring of beads, and gradually creep among the hair. The in&s;ide of the mouth, throat, and no&s;e, are al&s;o affected. The palate and glands of the throat become hot, painful, inflamed, and ulcerated; pu&s;tules appear in the roof of the mouth, which degenerate into round, malignant, phagaedenic ulcers, which rot the bone as far as the no&s;trils. The mem|brane which lines the in&s;ide of the no&s;trils is likewi&s;e liable to pu&s;tules, which pro|duce ulcerations, that infect the bones of the no&s;e with a caries, which being eaten away, the no&s;e falls down having lo&s;t its &s;upport; the voice becomes hoar&s;e and low, the gums ulcerate and rot, the teeth ach, grow rotten, and fall out, and the breath is very offen&s;ive. The mi&s;erable patient is tormented with pains in the night time, when in bed and covered warm with clothes, which become &s;o inten&s;e that the patient cannot lie in bed, the&s;e are either ten&s;ive, pricking, pul&s;ative, or rending, fixed or wandering, which &s;ometimes occupy the mu&s;cular and tendious parts, like the rheu|mati&s;m; &s;ometimes the tendons and liga|ments about the joints, re&s;embling the gout, &s;ometimes they are with &s;welling or inflam|mation, &s;ometimes without. At the dawn of the morning the&s;e pains remit and be|come more tolerable, 'till the &s;ucceeding
<PB N="28" REF="32">evening again exa&s;perates the pains, and renews the tragedy, which circum&s;tance di&s;tingui&s;hes venereal, from all rheumatic, gouty, or &s;corbutic pains whatever. All the&s;e &s;ymptoms gradually encrea&s;e; after|wards nodes or exo&s;to&s;es ari&s;e on the &s;kull, &s;hin-bones, and bones of the arms, which being attended with con&s;tant pain and in|flammation, at length grow carious and rotten. The lymphatic glands become hard and callous, and form in the neck, armpits, groin, and me&s;entery, hard move|able, circum&s;cribed &s;wellings, like the kings-evil. The lymphatic ve&s;&s;els being enlarged by a thick, &s;tagnating lymph, form &s;wellings, which are called Gummata; in the tendons it cau&s;es nodes, in the nerves ganglions, and in the ligaments of the joints tophs.</P>
<P>Neither do the eyes e&s;cape the fury of this di&s;ea&s;e, for they are externally affected with pain, redne&s;s, itching and lippitude, and internally being loaded with humours, &s;uppuration &s;ometimes happens and the &s;ight is de&s;troyed. The ears are affected with a &s;inging noi&s;e, deafne&s;s and pain, while their internal &s;ub&s;tance is ulcerated and rendered carious.</P>
<P>Women have di&s;orders peculiar to the &s;ex, as cancers in the brea&s;t, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion or overflowing of the monthly cour&s;es, the

<P>After this catalogue of &s;ymptoms, it is no wonder that all the animal, vital, and natural functions &s;hould be depraved, and that the unhappy &s;ufferer &s;hould fall into a decay, and at la&s;t worn out with pain, die con&s;umptive.</P>

<HEAD>Management of the Patient, in relation to Diet, Exerci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> while under the cure of the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>A thin, cooling, attenuating diet, is cer|tainly the mo&s;t proper to &s;often the blood, and re&s;olve the &s;curfy &s;cabs which defile the &s;kin, and for this end nothing is pre|ferable to pti&s;ans, made of &s;ar&s;aparilla with milk, in ca&s;e the per&s;on is of a dry hectical con&s;titution, or a decoction of guaicum, if he is cold or moi&s;t, and con&s;equently in|clinable to breed phlegm, he may eat milk, light puddings, eggs, either boiled or poached, chicken-broth, mutton or veal broth, chocolate, tea, water-gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If any wine is drank it &s;hould be di|luted
<PB N="30" REF="34">with Bri&s;tol-water, and this method &s;hould be continued 'till the cure is fully compleated. Great care mu&s;t be taken through the whole cour&s;e of the cure, ne|ver to indulge in any exce&s;s, for a little error committed on this head will certainly prove of very pernicious con&s;equence: all violent exerci&s;e ought to be avoided, as riding, jumping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for though the pox is a chronic di&s;ea&s;e, and upon that account may &s;eem to require &s;ome degree of mo|tion or exerci&s;e, yet it is frequently attend|with violent &s;ymptoms of an inflammation; for which rea&s;on, I &s;hould advi&s;e the pa|tient never to u&s;e more exerci&s;e, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided, than moderate walking, or gentle riding in a coach or chai&s;e, for the benefit of the clear, &s;erene air, which is of great efficacy in the cure of the vene|real di&s;ea&s;e. The government of the pa&s;|&s;ions is of the la&s;t con&s;equence, for it is not po&s;&s;ible to make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the cure, unle&s;s the &s;ick per&s;on is re&s;olv|ed to prevent their breaking out in irregular excur&s;ions. It therefore highly concerns the patient above all other things not to &s;uffer his fancy to rove after women, who &s;hould never come into &s;ight, if po&s;&s;ible, during the time he is under cure; for the&s;e irregular de&s;ires from wanton objects will retard the cure, and occa&s;ion tho&s;e

<P>Take three ounces of the infu&s;ion of &s;enna, and half an ounce of &s;yrup of buck|thorn, mix them into a draught, this pill and draught may be repeated four or &s;ive times, after which I recommend the mer|curial pills, directed under the article of the Virulent Gonorrhaea, or Clap, to be taken night and morning, drinking after each do&s;e, half a pint of the diet drink, prepared as directed in the preceding article, as warm as po&s;&s;ible. Between whiles, the patient &s;hould make u&s;e of the warm bath, &s;ince nothing &s;o powerfully moi&s;tens, and &s;oftens the fibres of the &s;kin, and as warm bathing renders the per&s;piration freer and more full, it con&s;equently removes the ob|&s;tructions, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts greatly the di&s;&s;olution of the pocky matter, &s;o that by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the warm bath, the time of cure is very much &s;hortned: the method here laid down, if &s;trictly attended to, and accom|panied with a &s;paring regular way of living will, in the wor&s;t ca&s;es, effect a certain cure, without the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to that di&s;agreeable and dangerous remedy, a &s;alivation. Sometimes the eruptions, blotches, ulcers, <HI>amp;c.</HI> may require &s;ome topical application, the be&s;t is the following ointment, a little of which may be &s;pread
<PB N="37" REF="41">on a piece of fine rag and applied to the larger eruptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> once in a day, which in a little time will di&s;per&s;e them.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">

<P>Take a quarter of an ounce of quick&s;ilver and di&s;&s;olve it in as much &s;pirit of nitre, as will &s;erve for that purpo&s;e, then add, by degrees, a quarter of a pound of melted hogs lard, and mix them into an oint|ment.</P>
<P>When the cure is fully compleated, the patient mu&s;t be very careful not to expo&s;e him&s;elf too &s;uddenly to the cold air, if the weather is extreamly &s;harp, lea&s;t from a too &s;udden con&s;triction of the fibres of the &s;kin, occa&s;ioned by the inten&s;e cold, he &s;hould be affected with rheumatic pains, frequently more tormenting, and more difficult to be removed, than tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. He mu&s;t al&s;o be very careful of endangering his con&s;titution, by running into exce&s;&s;es of eating, drinking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lea&s;t from a high way of living the &s;cabs, blotches, eruptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that di&s;ap|peared under the preceding cour&s;e of medicine, &s;hould &s;pring up again under the form of pu&s;tules and ulcers, equally trou|ble&s;ome to the patient, and more hard to be cured than tho&s;e which aro&s;e from the effects of the venereal poi&s;on.</P>

<P>IF the patient will &s;trictly confine him|&s;elf to a &s;lender and regular diet, the mercurial pills directed under the article of the Virulent Gonorrhaea or Clap, accom|panied with the decoction of Sar&s;aparilla, prepared and given in the following man|ner, will relieve in a very &s;hort time vene|real head-achs, and nocturnal pains, and if per&s;i&s;ted in, I have great rea&s;on to think will always cure, without &s;weating or con|finement, at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, even where a &s;alivation, or long continued cour&s;es of the decoction of the woods have failed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Receipt to prepare the Sar&s;aparilla Decoction</HEAD>
<P>To three ounces of the &s;ar&s;aparilla-root, as fre&s;h as it can be procured, not &s;poiled with long keeping, worms, &s;ea-water or moi&s;ture, add three quarts of river-water, and bring it to boil immediately in an open ve&s;&s;el, and let it boil away to two pints of the &s;trained liquor, that is, to about two

<P>There is great rea&s;on to think, that tho&s;e rheumatic complaints, which are &s;o com|mon and ob&s;tinate after a mercurial cour&s;e, may be cured by taking regularly for &s;ome time the decoction of &s;ar&s;aparilla, agree|able to the well known effects of that me|dicine, which is only to be depended on where mercury has failed, or when it is combined with it. I mention this, becau&s;e few di&s;ea&s;es re&s;i&s;t more the power of medi|cine than this, &s;o ob&s;tinate indeed they are, that often times they will not yield to a &s;e|cond &s;alivation.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="recipe">
<HEAD>Receipt for making the Re&s;torative Broth.</HEAD>
<P>Take two dried vipers &s;liced into &s;mall bits, three craw-fi&s;h brui&s;ed, two ounces of pearl barley, a cru&s;t of bread, a little mace and &s;alt, and boil them together over a gentle fire in two quarts of water, 'till one half is wa&s;ted away, &s;train off the remainder for u&s;e.

<P>As the patient gathers &s;trength, and his appetite encrea&s;es, half a chicken, or a bit of neck of mutton may be added to this broth. I would advi&s;e a couple of large i&s;&s;ues to be made between the &s;houlders, ju&s;t below the nape of the neck, which al|ways prove of great &s;ervice by draining the
<PB N="42" REF="46">lungs of the pocky particles, which mini&s;|ter fre&s;h &s;upply for the foul expectoration. when by the&s;e means, the hectic fever is &s;omething abated, and the &s;trength in &s;ome mea&s;ure repaired; the cure mu&s;t be at|tempted with the following gentle cour&s;e. Two or three grains of calomel made into a bolus, with con&s;erve of ro&s;es, mu&s;t be taken night and morning, drinking half a pint of the &s;ar&s;aparilla decoction, prepared as already directed, after each bolus; for &s;ar&s;aparilla, in emaciated and con&s;umptive habits from a venereal cau&s;e, is the greate&s;t re&s;torer of appetite, colour, fle&s;h, and vi|gour, yet known: if the &s;tomach will bear it, the other pint of the decoction &s;hould be taken, mixt with &s;ome new milk, at inter|mediate times every day.

<P>THE &s;igns of a broken con&s;titution are a great weakne&s;s in the loins, with a pain in the &s;mall of the back, a wa&s;ting away, wandering pains in the head, back, and brea&s;t, under the ribs; cold, clammy &s;weats, frequently break out about the forehead, temples and neck, flu&s;hings in the face, e&s;pecially after eating; a great weakne&s;s and frigidity of the private parts, tremblings and &s;udden twitchings often in a day &s;eize the nerves, tendons, and mu&s;|cles of the face, mouth, arms and legs, attended with a weakne&s;s in the joints; a dizzine&s;s and &s;wimming of the head; a lowne&s;s and faintne&s;s of &s;pirits; the body is generally co&s;tive, the &s;tools are of a clay like nature, and come away in &s;mall pieces lik dogs turds; the urine is thick and foul, and lets fall a &s;ediment which appears thro' the urine, as if threads were lying in the bottom of the chamber-pot; &s;ometimes the &s;urface of the urine is covered with a
<PB N="44" REF="48">grea&s;y &s;cum which in cold weather will congeal like a thin cake of fat. This ari&s;es from the oily parts of the blood melting down, and di&s;charging by the urinary pa&s;|&s;ages; a profu&s;e &s;tubborn gleet attends &s;ome, a dribling of urine, accompanied with hot &s;hooting pains others, the pul&s;e is weak and &s;oft, and from any &s;light motion beats quicker, more unequal, and as it were in an hurry. The dige&s;tion is bad, &s;o that the patient is mi&s;erably oppre&s;t with wind, which if it does not go off by frequent belchings, occa&s;ions &s;evere cholics.</P>
<P>To relieve the patient under the&s;e infir|mities, we mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to re&s;tore the tone of the &s;tomach, for which purpo&s;e I advi&s;e the following &s;tomachic draught, to be taken every other day, from which I have often found wonde&s;ul effects.</P>

<HEAD>Receipt for the Stomachic Draught.</HEAD>
<P>Take tincture of rhubarb prepared with wine, and tincture of hiera picra, each ten drachms, lavender drops one drachm, mix them together into a draught.</P>

<P>A large &s;poonful of this tincture may be taken two or three times in a day, drinking after each do&s;e a gla&s;s of water, with ten drops of acid elixir of vitriol in it.</P>
<P>This Tincture tends to &s;trengthen the &s;olids, to prevent the further di&s;&s;olution of the blood, re&s;tores its cra&s;is, and in the end whether the nervous or va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem be affected, is the mo&s;t powerful re&s;torative in nature, and mo&s;t likely to compleat the cure in all broken con&s;titutions.</P>
