<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author of this Work, be|&s;ides the Emolument that every Practitioner has a Right to expect from his Profe&s;&s;ion, had another Motive to encou|rage him to the completion thereof; to wit, a humane and Chri&s;tian Concern with which he had been long actuated for the Welfare of the Fair, who&s;e delicate Frames are too often a Prey to Di&s;ea&s;es, which, through the Decrees of Providence, peculiar
<PB N="2" REF="4">to their Sex, yet, through a mi&s;taken Mo|de&s;ty, they are loth to declare, and apply for Succour, from tho&s;e duly qualified, to relieve them.</P>
<P>They are here provided with the mo&s;t ra|tional, yet ea&s;y In&s;tructions, as well as with the mo&s;t &s;elect and approved of Re|cipes, either to prevent in Time, or cure them&s;elves of, when, through carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or any other cau&s;e they are &s;urpri&s;ed with, any of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers particular to their own Sex, but unknown to the other.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Males, young or old, make little, or rather, no &s;cruple, of unfolding any complaint they may labour under, to a Phy&s;ician, Surgeon, or Apothecary; while young Females, except abandoned Pro&s;ti|tutes, and many even of tho&s;e more ad|vanced in Years, through innate Mode&s;ty, an almo&s;t invincible Ba&s;hfulne&s;s; and a be|ing re&s;erved in the Extreme to the great Detriment of their health, by the ridicu|lous concealment of a beginning Di&s;tem|per, &s;uffer a kind of petty Martyrdom to mi&s;under&s;tood Notions of Virtue, which are con&s;equently the cau&s;e of their health and con&s;titution being ruined, and of their manife&s;tly pining away, though all around them can a&s;&s;ign no Rea&s;on; and no
<PB N="3" REF="5">Di&s;order of the Fair Sex is made &s;uch a de&s;tructive My&s;tery of, as that which &s;hall take the lead here; to wit,</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Men&s;trual Flux.</HEAD>
<P>UNTIL the Age of Puberty, (that is, of being capable to propagate the Species) which varies in different Nations, being earlier in the Southern Climes, and later in the Northern, young Males and Females are indi&s;criminately liable to the &s;ame Di&s;tempers; nor before that critical Period of Life, is there any &s;exual Differ|ence; the Cau&s;e of this Difference, the fir&s;t of that Cla&s;s, which, on Account of its be|ing the Fore-runner and fruitful Source, whence all others are derived, that in an e&s;|pecial Manner, afflict the more amiable Part of Society, mu&s;t afford us ample Matter of Admiration, as will obviou&s;ly appear to all who, in a philo&s;ophical or Chri&s;tian Light, &s;hall con&s;ider this e&s;&s;ential Evacuation.</P>
<P>The Womb of a Female being de&s;igned by Nature for the fir&s;t Receptacle and Nur|&s;ery of the yet unborn Being, is, after a certain revolutionary Period of Life, irri|gated with an extraordinary Quantity of Blood, at &s;tated Times; by which means the Ve&s;&s;els are u&s;ed to open and di&s;tend them&s;elves for the more ea&s;y Admi&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="4" REF="6">Monthly Tide, which when, by a kindly Di&s;charge is decrea&s;ed of its &s;uper-abounding Quantity, the &s;tretched Ve&s;&s;els recover their due Spring, and return the re&s;t to the ge|neral Cour&s;e of Circulation.</P>
<P>Nature's Intent, by this Proce&s;s, is, that after Impregnation, &s;uch encrea&s;ing Quan|tities of the Blood, derived to the Womb, are to &s;upply Nutriment to the Foetus; who, when brought forth, is &s;upported by Milk from the Brea&s;ts, of which the redun|dant Blood, then diverted from the Womb to tho&s;e Parts, becomes the nouri&s;hing Fountain.&mdash;While Things are thus carried on in their due Cour&s;e, all goes right; but as from every Deviation &s;ome new Malady ari&s;es, and indeed directly or indirectly all tho&s;e with which the Sex is peculiarly af|fected: and that we may progre&s;&s;ively fol|low them, we have fixed our Choice to be|gin with the men&s;trual Di&s;charge, that is perverted either by its Ob&s;truction, or an extraordinary Efflux, in a more or le&s;s vio|lent Degree.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> An Ob&s;truction, Suppre&s;&s;ion, or Stoppage, of the Men&s;trual Di&s;charge,</HEAD>
<P>IS cau&s;ed in young Females either by too great a Con&s;i&s;tence, Vi&s;cidity, or Sizi|ne&s;s of the Blood, which cannot force its
<PB N="5" REF="7">Way into the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, to be thro' them emptied to a certain Degree; or el&s;e is owing to too great a Compactne&s;s in the Fibres of the Womb, who&s;e &s;ecretory Ori|fices, or little Mouths are too clo&s;ely com|pre&s;&s;ed to yield Admi&s;&s;ion to any Ingre&s;s of the Blood, and con&s;equently preventative of &s;alutary Evacuations. In either Ca&s;e, the Blood's E&s;cape being debarred, its return into the general Circulation, on account of its augmented Quantity, makes offen&s;ive Lodgments on many Parts, through their Weakne&s;s rendered more liable to yield; and prove dangerous in Proportion to the Parts affected being more or le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to Life.</P>
<P>This Di&s;temper is ever attended with an Unwillingne&s;s to Action, an Heavine&s;s of Mind, a Palene&s;s of Complexion. Pains are felt both in the Groin and Loins, with a Difficulty of breathing; cold Sweats, hy&s;teric and fainting Fits, &amp;c. There en|&s;ues a total Depravation of all the Functi|ons of the Body. Nay, &s;uch hath often been the dreadful Effect of the Di&s;charge not being able to make its Way through the proper Outlets, as to force for it&s;elf an unnatural, violent, and perilous Egre&s;s, through the <HI>Anus,</HI> or Fundament, the Blad|der, Brea&s;ts, Eyes, Ears, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Bowels are wont to &s;uffer prodigi|ou&s;ly in &s;uch Patients, and in general, more
<PB N="6" REF="8">outrageou&s;ly, as their Con&s;titution is more delicate.&mdash;Hence what a Train of Maladies ari&s;e, particularly every Species of a de|praved Appetite, as is made manife&s;t by unnatural, and often offen&s;ive Longings, too well known to need being mentioned here.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above a&s;&s;igned inherent Cau&s;es of this Di&s;ea&s;e, whether in the too compact Structure of the Womb, or the too great Sizine&s;s ob&s;tructive to its e&s;caping by the emi&s;&s;ary pores; the following, which we may call external or adventitious ones, are not to be neglected, but rather &s;eriou&s;ly at|tended to; &s;uch are the improper U&s;e of a&s;tringent Remedies; of acids; and whatever may cau&s;e a Spi&s;&s;itude in the Humours; too incra&s;&s;ating a Diet; that is, Nouri&s;hment which thickens the Blood too much. A Suppre&s;&s;ion of the men&s;trual Di&s;charge is &s;ometimes cau&s;ed by too great an Evacua|tion of the Blood from a Wound, or other|wi&s;e; it being thence rendered too weak to force its Way by the Womb. It is al&s;o cau&s;ed by any &s;udden Terror, ob&s;tinate Grieving, a violent Cold, &amp;c.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Cure.</HEAD>
<P>IN general, where too great an Evacua|tion of Blood, or Weakne&s;s of the Pa|tient's Con&s;titution, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<PB N="7" REF="9">the leading Cau&s;e, it is proper the Patient &s;hould undergo a gentle Bleeding, in order to make Way for the Remedies operating more effectually; and during the Cour&s;e of taking them, to receive frequently the Steam of Camomile Flowers that had been boiled in Water, by the Means of a con|veying Tube, or Funnel, through a certain Part, to play upon the In&s;ertion of the Womb, in order to &s;often its Texture, in ea&s;e the Suppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be owing to the Toughne&s;s of its Structure.</P>
<P>But &s;hould there appear to be a &s;tagnat|ing Vice; that is, an Unwillingne&s;s to flow in the Blood, a Spur mu&s;t be given to its Lazine&s;s, by Fomentations, &s;uch as the above, accompanied with frequent Exer|ci&s;e, diluting Drinks, &s;uch as Tea, Whey, or a plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome Liquor, that may be made by infu&s;ing the Rinds of Oranges, Citrons, and Lemons, in Spring Water, till it &s;hall have acquired an agree|able Ta&s;te from them.</P>
<P>Then take the following Pills for &s;ome Time; to wit, Venetian Soap&mdash;Borax&mdash; Aloes&mdash;one Drachm each, to be made into Pills; each Pill to confi&s;t of three Grains; four Pills to be taken every Day; one a little after the Patient ri&s;es in the morning, and &s;ome Time before her Breakfa&s;t; an|other about an Hour, or at lea&s;t Half an Hour before Dinner; a third at about the
<PB N="8" REF="10">&s;ame Di&s;tance before Tea-Time in the E|vening; the fourth is to be taken on going to Bed.</P>
<P>Let the Patient &s;eek all Occa&s;ions of Exerci&s;e, of Merriment, and whatever may excite a Flow of Spirits. Some Time af|ter the bleeding in the Arm, if Matters &s;ucceed not as may be wi&s;hed, then let a gentle Bleeding in the Foot take Place; and this Practice carefully followed for &s;ome Time, cannot fail of effectuating a Cure, where con&s;ummate Weakne&s;s, an exhau&s;ted Con&s;titution, or other in&s;uperable Difficulties do not intervene.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> The immoderate Flux of the Men&s;trual Di&s;|charge.</HEAD>
<P>AS a due Di&s;charge of Blood by the Uterus every Month is an In&s;urer of Health, &s;o an extraordinary Efflux is the Harbinger of Sickne&s;s, and highly detri|mental to the Con&s;titution; becau&s;e it oc|ca&s;ions a Lo&s;s of Strength, which is at|tended by other Symptoms; to wit, Cru|dities from Indige&s;tion, a Lo&s;s of Appetite, a Sen&s;e of Oppre&s;&s;ion in the Stomach, a &s;ickly Complexion, oftentimes a &s;mall En|crea&s;e of Heat, a feeble Pul&s;e; a Swelling in the Feet, and a Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s during the Time of Sleep.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="11">
<P>The immoderate Flux of the men&s;trual Di&s;charge is effectuated in three different Manners: 1. By too plentiful and impe|tuous an Eruption at the u&s;ual Period. 2. Sometimes by happening twice, or oftener, within the Space of a Month. 3. Some|times by continuing &s;everal Days longer than they were wont to flow. The Cure to be obtained, is a re&s;training of the pre|&s;ent Flux, and keeping a future one within due Bounds. For this purpo&s;e let the Patient re&s;t, as long as convenient to her Situation of Life, in Bed upon her Back, and as much as po&s;&s;ible let her avoid &s;peaking. According as &s;he is &s;trong or weak, and concurring Circum&s;tances will allow, let her blood in the Arm. Care &s;hould be taken that no &s;trict Ligatures be &s;uffered on any Part of her Body, as by means of Garters, Sleeve-buttons, &amp;c. which are very prejudicial. Let the Patient's Diet be &s;lender, and con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Veal, Chicken|broths, Fi&s;h-&s;oups; let her con&s;tant Drink be Pti&s;an of Plantane, Yarrow, and Nettle|tops, into which, by way of giving it a Ze&s;t, put &s;ome Orange-peel, or of the greater Comfrey; but put in Lin&s;eed, if &s;he be of a hot and bilious Temperament.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;es where the&s;e Remedies do not &s;ucceed, then Recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the following pre&s;cribed by Dr. Mead, as a more efficacious one: "Take one Ounce
<PB N="10" REF="12">of burnt Alum, one quarter of an Ounce of Dragon's Blood, which reduce to a Pow|der; to tho&s;e of weakly Con&s;titutions let there be given from fifteen Grains to twen|ty; to tho&s;e of middling, from twenty to twenty-five; to tho&s;e of a &s;trong Habit, thirty Grains in a Gla&s;s of red Wine, di|luted with an equal Quantity of warm Water and to be taken three Times a Day."</P>
<P>In the more alarming Ca&s;es of this Ma|lady, the Womb, on account of its Orifice being in a quite relaxed State, may be &s;y|ringed with a Decoction of Yarrow, red Ro&s;es, Plantane, or with warm Water im|pregnated with the Powder of Roch-alum, or with Vinegar made warm.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Of the Whites, or Fluor Albus.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady is the running of a liquid Matter, from the private Parts of the female Sex, but &s;tinks not like Ul|cers, and is free from any infectious Taint. Its Colour is &s;ometimes white, &s;ometimes green, &s;ometimes yellow, &amp;c. It is &s;ome|times of an acid Nature, and excoriates the Parts, &s;ometimes not. This Species of run|ning is in general continued, but not co|pious. It is interrupted in &s;ome Patients, and returns either at irregular or &s;tated Pe|riods.
<PB N="11" REF="13">It is in many a con&s;tant Forerunner of the men&s;trual Di&s;charge, and after that is over, re-appears for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>The common Signs to di&s;tingui&s;h the Whites from the venereal Flux or Clap, is, that in the latter Ca&s;e the Di&s;charge is more copious, and continues during the Times of the men&s;trual Di&s;charge; where|as the former &s;uffers an Interruption: the Patient's Knowledge of her own Conduct mu&s;t help to judge in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Patients who labour under an un|interrupted Fluor Albus, or one that fre|quently returns, have a pale and &s;wollen Countenance, a Di&s;ta&s;te for their wonted Aliments, a Lo&s;s of Strength, frequent Pain about the Region of the Heart, be&s;ides trouble&s;ome Twitchings, and a &s;inking Weakne&s;s of the Stomach.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as this remote and fixed Cau&s;e of the Fluor Albus is in the Stomach, the &s;etting that to rights is the &s;ure&s;t Way of performing a Cure. Let the Patient &s;et off in the Beginning of the Di&s;order, when not much enfeebled, by letting a little Blood from the Arm; and in a Day or two after, be puked with one Grain of Tartar Emetic; if young, and rather weak, with half an Ounce of Tincture of Hipecacuanha; but if at her full Growth, and of a &s;trong Habit of Body, let two Grains of Tartar Emetic be employed; and when it begins
<PB N="12" REF="14">to operate, it is to be encouraged by drink|ing after each Effort &s;ome Camomile-tea. In a few Days after let her be purged with what ever purgative Medicine and Do&s;e &s;he may have been u&s;ed to; but if not habitu|ated to any, in ca&s;e the Patient be young and weakly, let fifteen Grains of Jalap in Powders be taken in a Di&s;h of Tea, or Whey, or any other inoffen&s;ive and weak Liquor warmed, to be al&s;o drunk from time to time, while the Medicines are operating, in order to encourage it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Preludes to a Cure, the Pa|tient mu&s;t betake her&s;elf to a proper Regi|men; that is, &s;he mu&s;t &s;hun all Ragou&s;ts, Fruits, Salads, Confectionary-articles, Roots; and live chiefly on Rice, Beef, Mutton, Fowl, and all Sorts of Food that tend to &s;trengthen the Con&s;titution. If denied ei|ther by the Place of her Abode, or of her Circum&s;tances, the means of procuring Ferrugineous Waters, &s;he may make an artificial one for her&s;elf, by boiling old pieces of ru&s;ty Iron in Water, of which &s;he is to drink half a pint each Day, if young, and of a weakly Con&s;titution; but if of a &s;trong Habit, and come to be full grown, then &s;he may drink a Pint, and every eight Days, for the fir&s;t Month, repeat the above Purgative; in the &s;econd, every fifteen Days; in the third Month let the Interval be of three Weeks; and once a Month af|terwards
<PB N="13" REF="15">for the Space of &s;ix, if the Malady &s;hould per&s;evere.</P>
<P>Immediately &s;ub&s;equent to the fir&s;t Purge, let her begin to take the following Reme|dies for a recent or inveterate State: 1. In the Commencement the Fluor Albus, and in as yet a not-emaciated Con&s;titution; an Infu&s;ion of Ro&s;emary drunk every Day, in the manner, and in the room of Tea, has been often known to prevent its far|ther Progre&s;s; but when of a long &s;tand|ing, and that it has re&s;i&s;ted the commonly advi&s;ed Remedies by female Friends, Go&s;|&s;ips, and Matron Advi&s;ers, &amp;c. Recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the following Remedy; "Take Extract of the Peruvian Bark, Nut|meg, Alum, of each one Scruple, and of Syrup of Clove a &s;ufficient Quantity, to make a Bolus of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Ingredients." Let the Patient begin by taking a very &s;mall Quan|tity from the Tip or Edge of a Tea-&s;poon, and &s;o continue for one Week, encrea&s;ing it the next and following, but there &s;he is to &s;top where the Quantity may be found di&s;|agreeable. In Ca&s;es where a Weakne&s;s of the Back is perceived, let a &s;trengthening Plai&s;ter (to be had at any Apothecary's &s;hop) be thereto applied.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> advi&s;es for the Cure of an inveterate Fluor Albus, to bathe in the Sea|water, and drink it. Tho&s;e who are &s;itu|ated near the Sea, may try; but &s;ince it
<PB N="14" REF="16">has been known to fail in &s;o many Ca&s;es, it is not &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon here, and frequent Exerci&s;e is preferable to it.</P>

<P>TO this Malady are &s;ubject Maids and Widows. It is attended with a &s;low, irregular, and almo&s;t imperceptible Fever. The Complexion of the Patient is di&s;co|loured, being &s;ometimes a gha&s;tly pale, at other times livid, and not rarely greeni&s;h, with a Circle of a Violet Colour under the Eyes. They feel a con&s;tant Irk&s;omene&s;s, and a De&s;pondency without any apparent Cau&s;e: the Pul&s;e is &s;mall, unequal, and va|riable; the Ancles and Eye-lids are apt to &s;well: the Face is bloated; a benumbing Dulne&s;s is diffu&s;ed through the whole Bo|dy: in the Legs and Feet are felt a ten&s;ive La&s;&s;itude; &s;uch Patients are al&s;o &s;ubject to a Palpitation of the Heart, racking Pains in the Head, and an inordinate De&s;ire of things totally unfit for nouri&s;hing the Body; to wit, Chalk, Coals, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Treatment in order to obtain a Cure, is to be commenced by a Purgative propor|tioned to the Patient's Strength, as may be gathered from our Directions in the Mala|dies already treated of. Then get, of Ca|&s;tile
<PB N="15" REF="17">Soap, three Drachms; of Rhubarb in Powder half a Drachm; Filings of Steel, half a Drachm; Species of Hiera Picra, half a Drachm; with a &s;ufficient Quantity of Orange Peels made into an Electuary; of which the Patient, if young and weakly, is to take the Quantity of half a &s;mall Tea Spoon full twice a Day; if grown up, and &s;trong, &s;he is to take, each Time, the Tea-Spoon full.</P>
<P>She is to eat nothing but whole&s;ome Food, and of ea&s;y Dige&s;tion, &s;uch as the young of all Kinds of Animals, Fowls, &amp;c. and to delight in much Exerci&s;e with|out continuing it to a weari&s;ome Fatigue. Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> has advi&s;ed, to take of the Tincture of Black Hellebore thirty Drops, two or three Times a Day; it &s;ometimes produces good Effects; and there is no Harm in trying it alternately, Day about, with the above Electuary, after the latter has been taken for the Term of a Week.</P>
<P>Mineral Waters, e&s;pecially of the ferrn|gineous or iron-Cla&s;s, prove often very ef|fectual in tho&s;e Di&s;orders, and may be drunk &s;everal Times in a Day in moderate Quantities, followed by &s;ome moderate Exerci&s;e immediately after. If the Di&s;tem|per be cau&s;ed by a Suppre&s;&s;ion of the men|&s;trual Di&s;charges, it is effectually removed by the Remedies that re&s;tore them. When

It is a continual and in&s;atiable De&s;ire of Copulation. All Re|gard to Decency is thrown a&s;ide. It begins by a moro&s;e Silence, and an occa&s;ional Spark|ling of the Eyes. The Patient is kindled at hearing any ob&s;cene or wanton Expre&s;&s;ions, and her Pul&s;e beats tumultuou&s;ly; &s;he al|ternately bur&s;ts into Fits of Weeping and Laughing.

<P>In order that a Cure may be attempted, the Patient mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t Place, renounce all Excitements to lu&s;tful Sen&s;ation, &s;uch as Reading, Conver&s;ation, Self-touching, &amp;c. She mu&s;t be copiou&s;ly and repeatedly let Blood. Her Food mu&s;t be of the milde&s;t Kind; &s;he mu&s;t avoid &s;alted Food, high Sauces, all &s;ea&s;oning whatever that may tend to en|flame. Her Drink mu&s;t be cooling, &s;uch as Whey, or other weak Liquor, with twenty Grains of Nitre, to be di&s;&s;olved in every Quart.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t frequently &s;it in half Baths of warm Water; when out of them let her as often as conveniently &s;he can, convey by
<PB N="18" REF="20">Means of a Funnel put into the Vagina, and up towards the Orifice of her Womb, the Vapours of warm Water. She is to take frequent Cly&s;ters of warm Water, with two Ounces of Manna di&s;&s;olved therein, which &s;he is to retain as long as conve|niently &s;he can. It will not be ami&s;s, from Time to Time, that Blood may be drawn more immediately from the &s;uffering Part, to apply Leeches to the Anus.</P>
<P>By this Proce&s;s the de&s;ired Ends are to be obtained; which are, 1. To dimini&s;h the Quantity of irritating Humours. 2. To correct the Acrimony of the remainder by a cooling Diet. 3. To dilute and weaken the local &s;timulatory Cau&s;e, by the Appli|cation of warm Water in Half-baths and Injections. 4. To act as an immediate Au|xiliary to the enflamed Womb in the gent|le&s;t Manner, by Manna's mildly operating in the &s;imple Form of Cly&s;ters, and, at the &s;ame Time, concurring with the other cu|rative Views, to relea&s;e the Fibres from their violent State of Ten&s;ion, and bring about the wi&s;hed-for Calm, which cannot be mi&s;&s;ed of, with the Concomitance of Regularity, Sobriety, and cha&s;te Company.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VI.</HI> Of the Vapours, or Hy&s;teric Pa&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady of the Female Sex ari|&s;es mo&s;tly from an Accumulating of the Blood in the Bowels, and is cau&s;ed chiefly by an Hindrance of the men&s;trual Di&s;charge, which Ob&s;truction is productive of much Mi&s;chief to the fair Sex, on ac|count of their tender Structure. It is fre|quently accompanied with a Vomiting, a Sen&s;e of Suffocation, a violent Compre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, convul&s;ive Efforts, &amp;c. Mai|den Ladies (in the true cha&s;te Sen&s;e) and Widows, are the mo&s;t liable to this Com|plaint. It is &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned by too immoderate Evacuations through whatever Means, whether of Bleeding, Puking, Purging, &amp;c. Sometimes by being debarred from a Commerce with the other Sex, in tho&s;e e&s;pecially who&s;e Frame con&s;i&s;ts of too delicate and irritable Fibres.</P>
<P>This very unaccountable Di&s;order ari&s;eth from many different Sources, and each re|quires different Views of Cure; thus it is wont to make its dreadful Inva&s;ion in what is vulgarly called a Fit. A compre&s;&s;ive Pain is felt in the Forehead, a Numbne&s;s of the Limbs, a Dimne&s;s of the Sight, an uni|ver&s;al Irk&s;omne&s;s is diffu&s;ed through all the
<PB N="20" REF="22">Parts; &s;omething, as if in a globular Form, &s;eems to force its Way upward through the Throat, and menace immediate Suffocation. The Speech is interrup|ted, the Heart is in a violent Palpita|tion, the Pul&s;e is irregular and hard. Very acid Matter, like to a greeni&s;h Bile, is thrown out by the Mouth. A tormenting Head-ach fixes in one Part, and is called the <HI>Clavus Hy|&s;tericus;</HI> racking Pains are felt in the Blad|der and Kidney, as if the Patient was af|flicted with the Stone; the Back aches pro|digiou&s;ly; an excruciating Tooth-ach often comes in for a Share. The Legs and Arms are cold. Fits of Weeping and Laughing &s;ucceed to each other, without any apparent Cau&s;e for either, and are accompanied with Convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Intention of curing is two-fold; one when the Patients are in the Fit; the other when they are out of it: Let the Body and Limbs be rubbed with warm Flannels; let the Legs be plunged deep into a warm Bath, in which are Camomile Flowers, or Bran, and there be detained for &s;ome Time; let the Soles of their Feet be tickled, let the Patients be pulled by the Hair in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts, to awaken the Faculty of Feeling; let the Fume of A&s;&s;a-foetida Leather, Horn, or of any &s;trongly &s;melling Sub&s;tance, when burnt, even of Tobacco, be conveyed through a Pipe
<PB N="21" REF="23">up their No&s;trils. Some Practitioners re|commend a few Grains of Mu&s;k, or Civet tied in a Rag, to be introduced into the Va|gina, and a&s;&s;ert this Method to have often proved very efficacious.</P>
<P>Treatment out of the Fit,&mdash;in order to prevent its Return, or, at lea&s;t, to make it abate of its Violence, when it &s;hall re-ap|pear: A bleeding in the Foot, to be fol|lowed in a Day or two by a Vomit of Hy|pecacoana, fifteen Grains for Girls about Fourteen; twenty Grains for tho&s;e between Nineteen and Twenty; for tho&s;e turned of Four and twenty, Twenty-five Grains&mdash;the Patients are to drink Camomile-tea by Prefe|rence, to quicken its Energy, and is productive of very good Effects on this Occa&s;ion. The following Remedy has been recommended by very eminent Practitioners, to wit, <HI>Mead, Hoffman,</HI> and others of no le&s;s Fame, do&s;|ed in the&s;e Proportions. Take twenty-four Ounces of &s;imple Pepper-mint-water, of Valerian in Powder two Ounces, and of Lavender-drops one Ounce; let them be perfectly well mixed together, and two or three Times in the Day, let the Patient take three large Tea-Spoonfulls. It is looked upon as a good Method to apply a large Galbanum-plai&s;ter to the Navel.&mdash;Twelve or fourteen Drops of the Spirit of Harts-horn taken in any proper Vehicle, as weak Tea, Whey, &amp;c. prove a &s;erviceable
<PB N="22" REF="24">Medicine. To make u&s;e of as a con&s;tant Drink, waters impregnated with Iron are a powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tant; and Women who are not &s;ituated in the Neighbourhood of &s;uch &s;alutary Springs, may, in Part, &s;ub&s;titute thereto by heating in the Fire Pieces of old ru&s;ty Iron, and plunging them repeatedly into Water, &s;mall Beer, Tea, &amp;c. which they drink.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who are liable to this afflicting Di&s;order, &s;eize on every Opportunity of taking Exerci&s;e; and although that on Hor&s;e-back hath been accounted the be&s;t, yet the others, &s;uch as walking, being car|ried in a Coach, Chair, &amp;c. are beneficial to a certain Point; let them &s;eek all Occa|&s;ions of Mirth, avoid dull Company, too &s;e|rious Conver&s;ation, melancholy Stories; and if they be &s;ingle, let them finally mak trial of that powerful Remedy, which the Matrimonial State alone provides, in a lawful and blamele&s;s Manner.</P>

<P>We think it proper to premi&s;e, that the Signs of Conception, e&s;pecially at the Be|ginning, are very ob&s;cure, becau&s;e common to &s;everal other Di&s;ea&s;es, and that more over they are different in different Women, which depend, in a great Mea&s;ure, upon a more or le&s;s robu&s;t Con&s;titution, and diffe|rent Manner of Living. However, the following Signs in general are declaratory of a Conception: the <HI>Men&s;es,</HI> or monthly Di&s;charge from the Womb (being at the End of the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third Month, after having undergone the Embraces of a Man) either entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or at lea&s;t very much dimini&s;hed, with a frequent Tendency to Puking; in the fourth Month, and, in &s;ome, not until the fifth, a Motion of &s;omething alive is felt in the
<PB N="24" REF="26">Womb, and, &s;oon after, that inwardly felt Intimation is perceived by others on ap|plying their Hands on the Belly; there then remains no longer a doubt of the Per&s;on's having conceived, being advanced in Preg|nancy, and big with Child. The Brea&s;ts &s;well to a greater Size than they were wont to be of, by the flowing thither of a &s;erous Fluid, the Forerunner of milk, which oozes out occa&s;ionally from, and admoni&s;hes them of the Motherly Care they are &s;oon to be charged with in &s;uckling their Children. Around the Nipple are darki&s;h Circles. The &s;welling or Expan&s;ion of the Abdomen, or Belly, is upwards.</P>
<P>All the pretended Foretelling, before its Birth, of what Sex the Child in the Womb is, ought to be treated with the highe&s;t Contempt, as a barefaced Impo&s;ition on the Belief of weak People, who have no Repugnance to let them&s;elves be made Dupes; provided if wi&s;hing for a Son, they are flattered with the Promi&s;e of their &s;oon being delivered of one.</P>
<P>A Drop&s;y is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from ad|vanced Pregnancy, becau&s;e in the former the &s;welling is in the lower Part of the Bel|ly; whereas in the latter it is in the up|per. Be&s;ides, another Proof which puts the Matter out of all Doubt, is, if the Patient's Swelling be Hydropical, that will appear by putting one Hand at either Side of the
<PB N="25" REF="27">Per&s;on's Belly, and then to pat or pu&s;h it gently with the other; the Hand on the oppo&s;ite Side will feel a Fluctuation of Water.</P>
<P>The chief Inconveniencies which preg|nant Women are liable to, are either a Lo&s;s or Depravation of their Appetite, a Nau|&s;eating, or Tendency to puke, a Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, a Heavine&s;s, an Head-ach, a Dizine&s;s, Dif|ficulty of Breathing, a Swelling of the Feet and Brea&s;t, a violent Tooth-ach; in all which Ca&s;es proper Re&s;t, as far as their Condition will allow, is required; and that they expo&s;e them&s;elves to no great Fatigue. A gentle Bleeding is often not ami&s;s. But if Pregnancy be the Con&s;equence of a private Love Affair, let the Patients com|municate their Situation to &s;ome experi|enced Female Friend, that may perhaps be able to advi&s;e; or at lea&s;t able to apply for them to the &s;killed in Phy&s;ic.

<P>THE Female Di&s;ea&s;e next, in order to Pregnancy, is Abortion, which is the premature Exclu&s;ion of the Foetus ma|ny Months before the natural Term. This Di&s;a&s;ter mo&s;t commonly happens in the third Month, or thereabout; the mo&s;t dan|gerous to the Mothers are tho&s;e that hap|pen on the fifth Month. To avoid being the Cau&s;e of any Mi&s;chief, we, for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons as in the preceeding Chapter, decline directing any complicated Remedy. Yet when the&s;e Forerunners of an Abortion are felt; to wit, a Pain in the Bottom of the Matrix, or Womb, or in the inward Parts of the Thighs, as well as &s;light &s;hi|verings between the Skin and the Fle&s;h, and at the &s;ame Time the Belly becomes depre&s;&s;ed and flatti&s;h about the Navel from pointed, which it had been in that Part at the Beginning of &s;uch Symptoms, Lin&s;eed has been often proved a very good Remedy to prevent a Mi&s;carriage, or Abortion. It may not al&s;o be ami&s;s to bleed about the third Month of Pregnancy, more or le&s;s, according to the Strength of the Per&s;on; and during the fir&s;t Months particularly, let it be remembered, that the Body is to be kept open with Rhubarb, or Senna, or other
<PB N="27" REF="29">Purgative of the mild Cla&s;s. We cannot fini&s;h this Section more profitably to the Common-wealth, than with a truly phy&s;ical, moral and religious inculcating to young Maids, who may have unfortunately been &s;educed, to beware of, and &s;hun, as they would Poi&s;on, all Remedies which the wicked recommend to cau&s;e Abortions, and for the following Rea&s;ons, obvious to the meane&s;t Capacity.</P>
<P>The Remedies that have been cried up by Ignorance and Vice, as capable of cau&s;|ing an Abortion, or Mi&s;carriage, are in Fact, nay ab&s;olutely not endowed with any &s;uch e&s;pecial Faculty; for the Way that they act towards, and contribute to that Pur|po&s;e, is by the Violence with which they exert them&s;elves when introduced into the human Body; where, by the outrageous Tumult which they cau&s;e, they are &s;ome|times productive of the too early Expul|&s;ion of the Foetus from the Womb, all &s;haken and convul&s;ed, by the general Com|motion cau&s;ed throughout the Mother's Frame, which &s;torm likewi&s;e frequently cau&s;eth her Death; &s;o by one unhappy Deed &s;he is guilty of Self-murder, and that of her Child.</P>
<P>But in tho&s;e Con&s;titutions where &s;uch ac|cur&s;ed Remedies cannot operate the wi&s;h|ed and diabolical Effect of murdering, and prematurely driving the Foetus out of the
<PB N="28" REF="30">Womb, whether through too great an Ad|he&s;ion, or &s;trong Contexture of the Parts, &amp;. then they exerci&s;e all their malignant Power on the Con&s;titution of the unhappy Mother, which they ruin for ever after; and thus &s;he &s;hortens her Date of Life, as but too many fatal In&s;tances have been known in Practice.</P>
<P>If they have no feeling for their yet un|born Babes let them have &s;ome Regard for their own Health, and well being, in this World; which, &s;hould they overlook, let them tremble at the Certainty of their be|ing to appear before a tremendous Judge on the la&s;t Day, and there to receive the Sen|tence of eternal Torture for the mo&s;t de|te&s;table, the mo&s;t barbarous and inhuman of all Crimes, a Mother guilty of the Mur|der of her own Child; nay, of tearing it bleeding ftom her own Womb before its al|lotted Time of Delivery.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> Of a Mole.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Term Mole, is to be under&s;tood nothing more than a fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance generated in the Womb; it is mo&s;t com|monly of a &s;pherical Form, and, until ocular Conviction after its Delivery, or a Continuance long beyond the Time of Child-bearing, hath been mi&s;taken for the true Con&s;equence of a Conception, a Foe|tus, or Child in the Womb.</P>
<P>Its Dimen&s;ions vary from the common Size of an Infant down to that of a large Nut-&s;hell. Some are of a membranous Texture, others of a &s;ofti&s;h or &s;pongy Con&s;i&s;tence, and have, in their middle, a Cavity. They &s;ometimes abound with lit|tle Bladders, called Hydatides, and, at others, they are replete with a &s;erous Mat|ter.</P>
<P>Moles are apt to alarm tho&s;e who are troubled with them, by a Di&s;play of Symp|toms at fir&s;t not unlike to tho&s;e of Wo|men really with Child. They differ much afterwards; for a dull heavy Weight, like a Ball of Lead, is felt when a Mole is the Ca&s;e; but it never does (like a living Foe|tus) exhibit a vibratory Motion to any Hand applied on the Out&s;ide of the Abdo|men,
<PB N="30" REF="32">which, in the State of undoubted Pregnancy, is &s;pherical and roundi&s;h.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t ignorant of the Sex may be per&s;uaded, beyond any Po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that they have a <HI>Mole</HI> in the Womb, when they perceive that an Increa&s;e of Bulk and Weight has exceeded by far the u&s;ual Time of Ge&s;tation or Child-bearing, which in general exceeds not nine Months, and the utmo&s;t Indulgence of Phy&s;icians to cover the Reputation of great Ladies hath never let it &s;tretch beyond eleven, the Truth of which Complai&s;ance is much doubted of, and not without Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Certainty of a <HI>Mole</HI> in the Womb being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the next Attention is to eject an idle Occupant of the fir&s;t Cradle of human Exi&s;tence, for the two-fold Rea|&s;on of being u&s;ele&s;s in it&s;elf, and preven|tive

<P>The Method to be followed by tho&s;e who do not chu&s;e to run the Ri&s;k of vio|lent internal Remedies, which ought not to be ventured on without proper Advice, is to take the fre&s;h &s;lender Root of a Walnut Tree, not exceeding in Length the Palm of the Hand, then to &s;have and poli&s;h it to the Thickne&s;s of a middle-&s;ized Finger, which is to be introduced, from Time to Time, into the <HI>Vagina,</HI> where it will ex|cite a tingling Sen&s;ation of Heat, and that being communicated to the Womb will provoke it to Action, and cau&s;e it, in Time, to eject its inanimate Contents, whether it be a real or dead Foetus, a Mole, or any Concretion formed in the Womb in Con&s;e|quence of a former Delivery not happily conducted. It will not be ami&s;s to accom|pany the above Application with the Repe|tition of a pretty &s;trong Puke, and Purga|tive, alternately, that is, within a few Days Di&s;tance of each; in order to accele|rate the de&s;ired Effect.

Doctor <HI>Mead</HI> advi&s;es, for the quickening of a De|livery, that a Grain of purified Opium be divided into two Pills, one to be taken &s;ix Hours after the other.</P>
<P>About an Hour after the Delivery the Mother ought to take a Tea-&s;poon full of the Oil of Sweet Almonds, and that re|peatedly, if it appear requi&s;ite, in order to &s;oothe the &s;ub&s;equent Pains. Then let a Catapla&s;m, made up of Oil of Sweet Al|monds two Ounces, with two or three new laid Eggs boiled together, be applied to the Parts, and, for the Space of two Days, be renewed every &s;ix Hours.</P>
<P>If the Pains after Delivery prove violent and menacing, then the following Pre&s;crip|tion has been experienced of the greate&s;t U&s;e: Take two Scruples of Sperma Ceti; ten Grains of volatile Salts of Hart&s;horn; ten Drops of Bal&s;am of Peru, and one Drachm of Venice Treacle; let them
<PB N="37" REF="39">be carefully mixed with as much Syrup of White Poppies as will &s;uffice to be made into four Do&s;es; one to be taken every &s;ix Hours, till the Pains di&s;appear; the Pati|ent is to drink Caudle very plentifully, and to be kept very warm.</P>
<P>In about fifteen Days after Delivery, and a vani&s;hing of the Pains attendant thereon, the late &s;uffering Parts are to be bathed with an a&s;tringent Decoction that they may be braced up; which Decoction is to con|&s;i&s;t of Half a Pint of red Wine, wherein are to be boiled red Ro&s;es and Balau&s;tins as chief Ingredients.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as after all Births that are any ways laborious, the Mother is in general weak, and very apt to faint, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and far from imprudent, by the Means of a Gla&s;s of hot Wine, or other generous Liquor, to comfort and keep up her Spirits. The &s;ame is to be repeated as often as &s;he &s;hall appear to &s;tand in need thereof. Comfortable Broths greatly con|tribute to forward a Recovery of Strength. All other Occurrences of a more intricate Tendency are to be remedied by profe&s;&s;ed Practitioners.</P>

<P>THE Advice with which we have clo&s;ed the la&s;t Section, mu&s;t take Place relative to the Di&s;orders of this Di&s;|charge immediately after Child-bearing, whether in Exce&s;s or dimini&s;hed, becau&s;e then the Patient, on account of &s;o en|feebled a State, can be of no Service to her&s;elf, and the relying on Friends in ge|neral is dangerous.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XIV.</HI> Di&s;orders of the Brea&s;ts after Child-bearing.</HEAD>
<P>THAT which commonly takes the Lead, and is therefore reckoned the fir&s;t, becau&s;e it appears the third or fourth Day after Delivery, is cau&s;ed by a Con|ge&s;tion, or Gathering of Milk in both the Brea&s;ts, or in either of them. It is thence called the Milk Fever.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually accompanied with a ten&s;ive or excruciating Pain: and al&s;o with a Tumor or &s;welling of both the Brea&s;ts, or either, that frequently extend to both Arm-pits, or at lea&s;t to that of the Brea&s;ts affected.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="41">
<P>This Pain of the Arm-pits is &s;ometimes violent to a mo&s;t in&s;upportable Degree. It is wont to per&s;evere for the Space of one to two Days, and then puts an End to it|&s;elf by copious Sweats, (always proportion|ed to the preceding cold Sweats) by which it is diverted out of the Body as a Benefit of Nature.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Ca&s;es, however, there may be a Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing gentle diaphoretic Re|medies that encrea&s;e Per&s;piration, or &s;ome of the hot diluting ones to a&s;&s;i&s;t and encou|rage the di&s;embarra&s;&s;ing of the Ve&s;&s;els in the Brea&s;ts; to which the Child ought of|ten to be put, and the Mother confine her|&s;elf to a &s;trict Diet.</P>
<P>But if it &s;hould not be the Intention of the Patient to &s;uckle the Child, then a more &s;trict Regimen is to be ob&s;erved, and a proper Per&s;on is to be procured to draw the Brea&s;ts, from Time to Time, which will contribute to hinder a Gathering there.</P>
<P>Moreover, a thickening of the Milk is to be hindered by embrocating the Brea&s;t with Oil of Sweet Almonds, or even with Lin&s;eed Oil. Nay, a warm Application of the Leaves of red Cabbage hath proved be|neficial on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as have al&s;o double Cloths dipped in Brandy, and then put under the Arm-pits. But if the Milk Fever &s;hould prove very hot, acute, and threaten immediate Inflammation, then Re|cour&s;e mu&s;t be had to Bleeding.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XV.</HI> An Inflammation of the Brea&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>IF, in a &s;hort Time after Child-birth, there happens a &s;tagnating of the Milk, accompanied with a Swelling and a Pain, it is called an Inflammation of the Brea&s;ts. Then inwardly let gentle Cordials be taken; and externally apply hot Linen Cloths &s;teeped in Rum. Care mu&s;t be taken to have the Milk drawn off &s;ome how or other, whether by the Mouth of an Animal, &s;uch as a Puppy, or the Hand of the Nur&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the Swelling, cau&s;ed by a Stag|nation of Milk, be ob&s;erved to be without Heat, then, with all po&s;&s;ibe Speed, let the Part be bathed with red Wine made warm, or Spirit of Wine camphorated. Nay, the Catapla&s;m or Plai&s;ter of white Bread, and red Wine boiled together, with the Addi|tion of &s;ome camphorated Spirit of Wine, has been recommended as a &s;ucce&s;sful Re|medy by &s;ome very good Practitioners.</P>
<P>When the Swelling appears inclinable to break, then make U&s;e of a &s;oftening Plai|&s;ter, particularly the common one with the Gums which will ripen it to an Opening. As &s;oon as it &s;hall be opened, take Care to clean&s;e it with a dige&s;tive Ointment, to heal
<PB N="41" REF="43">it with bal&s;amic Remedies, particularly the Bal&s;am of Peru, to be had at any apotheca|ry's &s;hop.&mdash;Women, in this di&s;order, are li|able to a di&s;agreeable attendant upon it, and that is, a Chapping in the Nipples, which in that ca&s;e are to be anointed with a mix|ture of oil and bees wax.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVI.</HI> An Inflammation of the Uterus, or Womb.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady happens frequently to Child-bed Women, at the &s;ame time of the Milk Fever appearing; however, if proper care be taken to oppo&s;e its progre&s;s in the Beginning all will go well. There|fore let the Patient take inwardly oil of &s;weet Almonds alone to the Quantity of Half an Ounce. But for exterior Remedy, let the whole Abdomen, or Belly, be duly anointed with Oil of Dill an Ounce, with the &s;ame Quantity of white Lillies and Ca|momile, to which add a Drachm either of Camphire or Caraways, over which a double Napkin mu&s;t be laid.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVII.</HI> The Cancer.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Malady is incidental either to the Womb or Brea&s;ts in Women. It begins at fir&s;t with a &s;mall Swelling, no
<PB N="42" REF="44">exceeding a Nut in Bigne&s;s; nor does the Colour of the Skin, on the Brea&s;ts, undergo any &s;udden Change, becau&s;e the Cancer, without cau&s;ing any terrifying Alarms in its fir&s;t Stages, continueth, as it were, a &s;ilent Progre&s;s for many Years.</P>
<P>But when the fo&s;tering Humours of that Evil is endowed with a greater Degree of Activity, the Swelling is &s;uddenly enlarged into a great, unequal, round, and livid Tu|mour, accompanied with a racking Pain.</P>
<P>Finally, it terminates in a Rupture, and thence di&s;charges a Blood-urged Stinking, and acrimonious Humour, which, by prey|ing upon the Parts that are &s;ound, render the Lips of the Wound gha&s;tly and horrible to Sight, nay often Death.</P>
<P>The Cancer of the Womb &s;eldom ad|mits of any Cure, becau&s;e the Patient, ge|nerally &s;peaking, is in a de&s;perate State be|fore it can be a&s;certained. The Cancer of the Brea&s;ts, as well as of the other Parts, if timely taken in hand, is often cured; for which End the following Remedy is recom|mended for its powerful Virtue by a very eminent Phy&s;ician. Get two Ounces of the Shavings of Guaiacum, which boil in two Quarts of Water, and let it continue to boil until it be reduced to three Pints. Half a Pint of this Decoction is to be drank twice a day.</P>
<P>For external Application&mdash;Make u&s;e of a fomentation of Milk and Water, in which
<PB N="43" REF="45">Camomile Flowers had been boiled and let that be &s;ucceeded by a Pultice of White Bread and Milk.</P>
<P>The Patient mu&s;t be ever mindful that the Cancer mu&s;t be pre&s;erved with all imaginable Care from every Impre&s;&s;ion of the cold Air, on which, for that Purpo&s;e, ought con&s;tantly to be &s;pread a little of the Sperma Ceti Ointment, which &s;alutary Practice ought to be renewed every Day two or three Times.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude the pre&s;ent Section with a more e&s;&s;ential Advice to all labour|ing under this Di&s;temper, than to bid them avoid dealing with ignorant Quacks, or No|&s;trum Retailers for a Cure, becau&s;e the tak|ing &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t lead to certain Danger.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. XVIII.</HI> Ulcer of the Womb.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal and determining Sign by which this Malady may be known is by a Di&s;charge of &s;tinking and purulent Matter that is &s;treaked all over with Blood and the greater the Quantity oozing from it is, the deeper you may pronounce the Ul|cer to be: But when the flowing Matter is not di&s;tained with Blood, then no more than the &s;erous and lymphatic Ve&s;&s;els are affected; but when it is of a reddi&s;h colour, then, to a certainty, the Blood Ve&s;&s;els are attacked.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="46">
<P>The following Injection is recommended: Let an Ounce of Honey of Ro&s;es in half a Pint of Water be heated to a proper De|gree, to wit, &s;uch as can be borne without exciting a Sen&s;e of Pain, which, by means of a Sponge, is to be applied through the Vagina on the ailing Part &s;everal Times in the Day. Half a Tea Spoon-full of the Tincture of Myrrh may be added to each Injection.</P>
<P>But in order to correct the Acrimony of the Blood, a Milk Diet is the mo&s;t effectual, which may be relieved, from Time to Time, by the U&s;e of Herb Soups, light Broths, as of Veal, Chicken, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have now treated &s;ufficiently of all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers incidental to the Fair Sex; and which every Individual, either through their own Sagacity, or with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome intelligent Female Friend, may &s;afely un|dertake the cure of.&mdash;There are no ca&s;es omitted, but tho&s;e quite out of their Reach to bring any Help to, and that require both the In&s;pection, as well as Operation, of a &s;kilful Surgeon.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, a few &s;light Di&s;ea&s;es, or rather Deficiences of Nature in the mar|ried State, that ob&s;truct the Propagation of the Species; but Decency forbids me to mention any thing about them, le&s;t Liber|tini&s;m &s;hould make a vicious U&s;e thereof.</P>
