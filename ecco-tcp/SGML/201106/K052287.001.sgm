<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT RESPECTABLE MY Ancient and well-beloved PATRON THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHY don't you dedicate to</HI> Mr. PIT?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, Sir, I would rather &s;et forth my own Talents than the Virtues and Prai&s;|es of the be&s;t Man upon Earth. I love to &s;ay Things that no One el&s;e ever thought of, extraordinary, quite out of the common way. I &s;corn to echo the Voice of every Fellow that goes the Road. Whether the Ve&s;&s;el of the Common-Wealth &s;hall &s;ink or &s;wim; what is it to me? I am but a Pa&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">
<HI>But, then, there is a Manner in doing Things you know.</HI></P>
<P>No, Sir, it is no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. Mr. <HI>Pit</HI> is the Patron of my Patron; let my Patron then dedicate to him, and wel|come, dedicate Statutes, Temples, Monu|ments as la&s;ting as the Benefits conferred! It is nothing to me; neither will I &s;ay a Syllable more about the matter.</P>
<P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Re&s;pectablene&s;s,</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the Dedication is the &s;hort|e&s;t Part of a Book, and held by all Rea|ders to be the vile&s;t and mo&s;t contempti|ble; yet the Writer and his Patron, the Dedicator and the Dedicatee, have a diffe|rent way of thinking; the Latter, on ac|count of the Incen&s;e that it breathes, and the Former, on account of the Profit that it brings, look upon it as the mo&s;t impor|tant Part of the Performance.</P>
<P>Alas! how little Con&s;ideration is left, for the Race of Writers, among the Race of Readers, e&s;pecially on this Chapter of Dedications.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="4">
Your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, perhaps, hath not duely perpended the Travail, the Toil, the marvellous Drudgery, the Muck that Dedicators are obliged to pa&s;s through, and the Fences of Truth over which they mu&s;t break, in order to cull, &s;elect, and &s;ublimate an Offering fit to lay upon the Altar of Adulation.</P>
<P>Through what a World of Weeds do they range to gather their little No&s;egays; from what a Profu&s;ion of Offences do they extract their Perfumes; and, how many Nights do they watch, to concentre and realize a &s;ingle Mouthful of Moon&s;hine for the Gratification of their Partrons.</P>
<P>The Trades al&s;o, incumbent upon them, are manifold, &s;uch as of Painting, Patch|ing, and Pla&s;tering; of Embroidering, Shaping, and Shaving; and of Tyring, Trimming, and Tayloring; in order to &s;mooth and garni&s;h the Man <HI>whom it de|lighteth them to honour,</HI> and to furni&s;h him with a full Suit of Prai&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">
But your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, I humbly hope, would not wi&s;h me to be at all this Trouble; for indeed Trouble is a Thing that I do not affect. There is, al&s;o, a kind of Delicacy requi&s;ite in tickling the Ribs of Vanity. I am at be&s;t but a down|right &s;ort of a Fellow. And, &s;hould I, aukardly pre&s;ume to da&s;h your Merits, full, into the Chops of your Mode&s;ty, I might de&s;erve but ill at the Hands of your Re&s;pectablene&s;s.</P>
<P>My Grandmother, Peace be with her! I remember one thing among the many good Advices, which &s;he gave and I for|got. <HI>Never di&s;grace your&s;elf,</HI> quoth &s;he, <HI>in order to do Honour to any One breathing.</HI> Think not, therefore, my mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble Patron, that I will either deba&s;e my|&s;elf by cajoling you to your Face, or do Violence, to Truth, by any kind of Pane|gyric when your Back &s;hall be turned.</P>
<P>That I have received many Favours from your Greatne&s;s, and have a compe|tent Sen&s;e of Gratitude for the &s;ame, is mo&s;t certain. It is al&s;o true that all my
<PB N="v" REF="6">Studies and Labours have been applied for your Service, and that I wi&s;h no other Death than that of laying down my Life for your Sake. Yet, with all my Love for your Per&s;on, and Endeavours for your Pro&s;perity, I cannot find about me the &s;malle&s;t Scantling of Veneration for your Virtues.</P>
<P>You have, however, the Satisfaction to be quite ea&s;y upon this Score, and no way to be mortified at any Sentiments to your Di&s;advantage. Your Fund of good Hu|mour on &s;uch Occa&s;ions is inexhau&s;tible; and you have often joined with me in re|proving and ridiculing your own Vices and Follies, which at all times you take more plea&s;ure to rally, than I apprehend you will at any time take Pains to amend.</P>
<P>I remember that in my Youth I was a great Builder of Ca&s;tles, and, having your Intere&s;t always at Heart, and &s;eldom out of my Head, I employed my Time in form|ing a thou&s;and romantic and airy Schemes for your Advantage.</P>
<P>I once propo&s;ed to build your Happine&s;s on Religion, on Chri&s;tian Piety, and a
<PB N="vi" REF="7">deep Sen&s;e of Duty; but, having in vain &s;ought a Foundation whereon I might lay the fir&s;t Stone, the Super&s;tructure vani&s;h|ed like the Clouds of la&s;t <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>I then attempted to plan the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, of your Liberty and Renown, upon the ancient and approved Principles of the SPARTAN POVERTY. As this had been barely a heathen Virtue; as it had rai&s;ed and &s;upported that great and glori|ous People, through many &s;ucceeding Cen|turies, in an uninterrupted Enjoyment of Freedom, Power, and Pro&s;perity; and, as nothing appeared to be wanting to the Ac|compli&s;hment of this Scheme, &s;ave a few &s;imple Articles, &s;uch as Moderation, Con|tent, Self-Denial, and &s;o forth, I made no doubt of your embracing the Terms with Joy.</P>
<P>On paying my fir&s;t Vi&s;it, your Re&s;pect|ablene&s;s was ju&s;t come from a <HI>Corporation-Cant,</HI> where I was told you had &s;et your OWN MOTHER up to Sale; but your Dignity was &s;o drunk at the Co&s;t of the Bidders, that I cho&s;e to defer Matters to a more &s;ober Opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="8">
On my next Addre&s;s, I under&s;tood that the Equipage of your Re&s;pectablene&s;s was in waiting; for it is not with you now as in the Days of Queen <HI>Be&s;s.</HI> You were ha&s;tening to &s;ee the <HI>Italian</HI> Puppet-&s;hew. As I advanced to pay my Re&s;pects, I was dazzled by the Ornaments with which you had glorified your Per&s;on, All, the Product of foreign Looms and of foreign Labours; your Linen of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> your Point of <HI>Spain,</HI> your Ruffles of <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> with a full Suit in the Cut of <HI>France,</HI> and trim|med like That of the three Brothers in a Tale of a Tub. In &s;hort you were &s;o &s;a|tisfied, &s;o wrapt, &s;o full of your Finery, you could, then, attend to nothing, &s;ave the Contemplation of Your fair Self.</P>
<P>I &s;till had Patience. I watched my Time. I attended You, late on a Sunday Evening, when I thought you at Lei&s;ure from the Fervour of your Devotions. But, how was I &s;truck of a heap, when your Footman informed me that &s;ome Noble|men and Ladies, of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Di&s;tinction, had engaged you for the Af|ternoon, at the GAMING TABLE.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="9">
Soon after, I was appri&s;ed that, what with &s;pending your Time and Money, in running to Raree-Shows; in playing four Corners and a Fool; in Drinking, Dre&s;|&s;ing, Drabbing; and in Gormandizing, and Gambling; the Finances of your Re|&s;pectablene&s;s were con&s;iderably &s;unk. It al&s;o, came to my Ear that you were huge|ly fond of COCK-MATCHES, though you kept them as far as po&s;&s;ible from your own Dunghill; That it was your Cu&s;tom to Bett on one Side, and then to Bett on t'other Side, and to lo&s;e your Money on all Sides; and that, by the&s;e and the for|mer Means, your Re&s;pectablene&s;s was dipt, &s;o up to the Ears, in Debt, it was thought your yearly Income would, in time, barely an&s;wer the Intere&s;t of what you owed.</P>
<P>It was now confidently affirmed, may it plea&s;e your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, that You your&s;elf were apprehen&s;ive of being re|duced to &s;udden Indigence. And I eagerly &s;eized this Occa&s;ion of waiting upon You, in order, as I tru&s;ted, to reconcile You to your Fate, and, po&s;&s;ibly, to delight You
<PB N="ix" REF="10">with the Pro&s;pect of your approaching Poverty. For I &s;ighed when I reflected on your intemperate and unbounded Thir&s;t after <HI>Riches,</HI> That <HI>Death to national Na|ture,</HI> which had proved the <HI>mortal Poi&s;on</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> and of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of all People who ta&s;ted it, from the Beginning of the World to this pre&s;ent good Day.</P>
<P>Being &s;hewn to your Apartment, I per|ceived your Greatne&s;s &s;eated in a moody kind of Attitude. But, having formerly had the Honour of being known to You, I took a Chair without Ceremony; and, chatting with You awhile about the Wea|ther, the News of the Day, and &s;uch like ponderous Matters, as &s;age Mini&s;ters and &s;age Politicians are wont to do. I began to introduce and open the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Pray, Mi&s;ter, &s;aid your Dignity (&s;ome|what &s;hort) have You any particular Bu&s;i|ne&s;s with me, at this Time? I am come may it plea&s;e You, &s;aid I, to propo&s;e a &s;peedy and effectual Method for the Sup|ply of all your Wants. At the&s;e agreeable Tidings, all the Ears, your Re&s;pectable|ne&s;s had, were pricked up and opened to
<PB N="x" REF="11">Audience.&mdash;Go on, my Good Friend, di&s;patch, in Heaven's Name!</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e You, added I, it was the Cu&s;tom of all the Seers and Sages, of an|cient Days, to introduce Truth and Wi&s;|dom under the Covering of Fable; and this Covering was as a Nut-Shell, if your Teeth were able to crack it, you had the Kernel for your Pains. Permit me then, at lea&s;t to imitate their Manner; for, though the Matter &s;hould happen to drop by the Way, the fir&s;t Traveller who takes it up may be bettered thereby.</P>
<P>Once upon a time, for &s;o &s;ays my Story, a Hou&s;holder, with his Family, was ca&s;t on a certain I&s;land, where, through a Pro|ce&s;s of Years, they propagated till they be|came a little Nation. The Soil was ex|ceeding fertile, but there was neither Ri|ver nor Spring in all the Land. Nature, however, had provided for this Defect, by a Kind of Fruit; that perfectly allayed the Thir&s;t; It was bitter to the Ta&s;te, but left an agreeable Flavour in the Mouth, and gave Health, Spirits, and Vigour to the whole Con&s;titution; and it was called by a Name
<PB N="xi" REF="12">which, in our Language &s;ignifies as nearly as I can render it THE FRUIT OF ABSTINENCE.</P>
<P>There was, al&s;o, other Fruits, of a Species wholly the Rever&s;e of the former; for the Flavour of the&s;e was extremely de|licious; but then they enflamed the Thir&s;t, enervated the Frame, and were called by a Name that &s;ignified the FRUIT OF INDULGENCE.</P>
<P>As, almo&s;t, all People made this latter Fruit a Part of their daily Food; the nati|onal Thir&s;t, in time, became &s;o great, that the Liturgy, of their Church, was al|together compo&s;ed of Prayers for Rain. O <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;ome Water, a little Water, dear Mi&s;ter <HI>Jupiter,</HI> Water, water, water, we pray for nothing but Water! &s;ink us, plunge us, drown us, overwhelm us with Water!</P>
<P>On the Decline of every Sun, &s;everal Families &s;pread out the Fleeces of their Flocks, as al&s;o their Sheets, and Blankets, for the Receiving and Retaining of the nightly Dew. Others furni&s;hed them&s;elves with &s;mall Alembicks for di&s;tilling the
<PB N="xii" REF="13">Urine of their Hou&s;hold. Some took a Twelvemonth's Voyage to bring back as much Liquid as they might &s;ub&s;i&s;t on for a few Weeks. And the Geniu&s;es of the Nation employed them&s;elves in various Projects, &s;uch as the chimical Extraction of Moi&s;ture from Bi&s;cuit and old Fiddles; as al&s;o the hanging Nets of a peculiar Texture, on Poles of due Elevation, for catching the Clouds.</P>
<P>Your Re&s;pectablene&s;s has my Tale.&mdash;Can make nothing of it, &s;ay You?&mdash;Suppo&s;e the <HI>Thir&s;t,</HI> of this People, an Em|blem of their <HI>Avarice,</HI> and <HI>Wealth</HI> to be repre&s;ented by <HI>Water,</HI> in the Fable.&mdash;</P>
<P>In &s;hort, may it plea&s;e your Dignity, I have brought You (here it is) a Refine|ment on the In&s;titutions of the great <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> Could I, like the Legi&s;lator of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> prevail upon you barely to abridge your De&s;ires, You would find your&s;elf wholely a Stranger to Want. You would thereby acquire the Wealth of Greatne&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Gloriou&s;ne&s;s; that Peace, that Solidity of &s;ublunary Enjoy|ment, which can only be found in a volun|tary POVERTY.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="14">
Scarce had I pronounced the la&s;t fatal Word, when your Re&s;pectablene&s;s &s;tarted up in a Pa&s;&s;ion. You a&s;ked me if I had not &s;een the Levee of Duns at your Gate, and the Catchpoles that lurked for You at every Corner. You con&s;igned me, with a very good Will, to the Devil; and de|&s;ired that, the next time I pre&s;umed to turn State-Quack, I &s;hould not pre&s;cribe Drink to a drowning Man.</P>
<P>As I retired, under the greate&s;t Dejecti|on of Spirits.&mdash;Ho! you cried, hone&s;t Friend! Mr. what do they call you? come back! You, who &s;catter your Money as fa&s;t as your Words; as profu&s;e of your Pur&s;e as you are of your Opinions; You who always run a Mile before your Rents, and live upon the Harve&s;t of the next Year's Sickle; are not You al&s;o a <HI>poor De|vil,</HI> One of the <HI>Diogenical Gentlemen,</HI> as very an <HI>Emperor of the Tub</HI> as my&s;elf?</P>
<P>Preach up Poverty, with a Pox! fir&s;t get wherewithal to pay your own Debts. The <HI>ready Runners!</HI> my Boy, the <HI>pa&s;&s;able
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">Pictures!</HI> the <HI>royal Pages!</HI> the <HI>Sparklers!</HI> the <HI>Portable!</HI> the <HI>Potable!</HI> Ay marry, this would do, this would fortify your Argu|ment, this would mould me to your Form, and per&s;uade me to your Faith. It is this, my little Lad, that would &s;hut too the Door on all manner of Temptations, and kick the Corruptions, you have &s;o often complained of, into the Kennel. Come, ca&s;t me the Nativity of this <HI>bright Son of Phaebus,</HI> draw me a Scheme for rai&s;ing this <HI>Egyptian</HI> from the Deep; and You &s;hall be my <HI>Darling,</HI> my <HI>Bardling,</HI> my <HI>hourly Oracle,</HI> my <HI>Apollo of Delphos,</HI> and what not.</P>
<P>Was your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, &s;aid I, ever told your Fortune? perhaps it might bear &s;ome Re&s;emblance to my own. I was a Boy, when the cunning Man, peering ear|ne&s;tly into my Palm, uttered a Sentence, which I &s;hall remember the longe&s;t Day I have to live. You will always, &s;aid he, be getting a Power of Money, and, take my Word, you will never be worth a Groat.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="16">
Indeed, could I have prevailed upon your Re&s;pectablene&s;s to be contented with Poverty, I was in Hopes you would have enriched your Monitor for his Pains. But, in truth, I'm a very A&s;s at this Bu&s;ine&s;s of getting Money either for You or my&s;elf; and as for the keeping it, when I have got it, I have, long &s;ince, given up all thoughts of the Matter. I will, however, do my be&s;t to add to the Glories, to the Virtues, as I may &s;ay, of your Re&s;pecta|blene&s;s, in a Manner more acceptable than my pre&s;ent Plan has proved.</P>
<P>I am your Dignity's mo&s;t devoted, and wi&s;h you a mighty good Evening.</P>
<P>HAVING thereafter con&s;igned my late Scheme to Bakers and Barbers, and to all the vile&s;t Applications of wa&s;te Pa|per. I &s;at down to &s;tudy and provide a Remedy for that feveri&s;h Kind of Con|&s;umption, under which your Re&s;pectable|ne&s;s apparently laboured during our late Confabulation.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="17">
I was &s;en&s;ible, at the &s;ame time, that your <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> was common to many other Countries, and that it was no where held to be dangerous, fora&s;much as it only con|&s;i&s;ted of <HI>two Articles,</HI> the <HI>Sen&s;uality of the Body,</HI> and the <HI>Corruption of the Mind.</HI></P>
<P>I al&s;o knew that, in former Ages, a great Number of <HI>Publicks</HI> had been affect|ed with the very Malady that now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed your <HI>Re&s;pectablene&s;s,</HI> and yet had lived merrily under it to their dying Day.</P>
<P>I wi&s;hed, however, to keep that Day at &s;ome Di&s;tance from your Greatne&s;s; and, with long and inten&s;e Labour, and at the Co&s;t of many a Candle, during my night|ly Lucubrations; I compounded a Medi|cine of approved and infallible Efficacy, con&s;i&s;ting, for the Nonce, of a quantum &s;ufficit of the TEMPERANCE and PATRIOTISM of the primitive <HI>Ro|mans.</HI></P>
<P>I knew that the Cure would follow, but how to prevail upon your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, to &s;wallow the Pre&s;cription, was a &s;mall matter of Difficulty that yet remained.
<PB N="xvii" REF="18">For, it is a Misfortune peculiar to Tho&s;e who are bit by Love, Avarice, Ambition, Pride, and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, that they dete&s;t the Thoughts of a Re&s;torative, and are &s;o enamoured of their Di&s;temper they would rather &s;ee the Devil than Doctor <HI>Apollo</HI> him&s;elf at their Door.</P>
<P>I, again, had the Honour of being ad|mitted to an Audience. I called up and exhau&s;ted all the Powers of Oratory on that capital Occa&s;ion. I demon&s;trated, to your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, that the whole Weight and Elevation of the <HI>Roman</HI> State re&s;ted, &s;imply, on the two Pillars of TEMPERANCE and PATRIOTISM, on which it ro&s;e, encrea&s;ed, and &s;tood &s;up|ported through many Ages; till, tho&s;e Pillars being gradually &s;apped, the mighty Structure, with its &s;aid Foundation, de|cay'd, grew ruinous, and fell confounded together. That Temperance is nece&s;&s;ary to the Strength of a Man, as Patrioti&s;m is nece&s;&s;ary to the Strength of a People. That each <HI>Roman,</HI> thus nerved and pow|erful apart, was yet &s;trengthened, a hundred thou&s;and fold, by an invi&s;ible Chord which run from Man to Man and
<PB N="xviii" REF="19">united All, as One, in the LOVE OF COUNTRY. That hence &s;prung the <HI>Helicon</HI> of their abundant In&s;piration to Toil, Indu&s;try, Frugality, Valour, Con|que&s;t, and Glory. They were &s;wallowed, like &s;o many Drops, in this Ocean of Pa|trioti&s;m. They were lo&s;t to every Care and Sen&s;ation of SELF; and were only found where they laboured, fought, bled, or expired for their COUNTRY!</P>
<P>While, warmed and &s;omewhat rai&s;ed by the Elevation of my Subject, I thus rea&s;oned on National-Power, on human-Excellence, on Virtue, on Temperance, on Patrioti&s;m, and Glory! I &s;hall never forget the kind Concern which your Re|&s;pectablene&s;s expre&s;&s;ed for me, in the evi|dent Alarm and Compa&s;&s;ion of your Coun|tenance, as for a Per&s;on who&s;e Fit you feared was approaching.</P>
<P>Being, both of us, more compo&s;ed, your Greatne&s;s was pleas'd to demand whether this Romance was wholly of my own Invention, or, if I had lately been fi&s;h|ing the Well, where Truth was formerly drowned, for an <HI>Ens Rationis</HI> of &s;ome &s;pe|culating
<PB N="xix" REF="20">Philo&s;opher? Where, you cried in the name of Wonder, have you been able to gather together &s;uch an old fa&s;hi|oned Bundlement of Scientific Balderda&s;h? You &s;hall bring me to the Practice, exact|ly, at the Period that the Hogs &s;hall be brought to feed along with the Herrings; or at the time of the Appearance of the Comet with the three Tails; or on the Week of the four Fridays, &s;o long looked for by A&s;trologians.&mdash;Here! exclaim|ed your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, who waits? All you, my Printers, Editors, and other Porters who attend at the Gate of the Public! &s;hould this Fellow come, any more, with the&s;e his Preachments of Piety, and Poverty, and Patrioti&s;m, and Stuff, I command Ye to &s;hut my Doors directly in his Face.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Re&s;pectablene&s;s, I am but a very little Man, and of a very lowly Temper, and yet I could not but be piqued at the Severity of this Treatment. I was, as a trodden Worm, and turned upon your Greatne&s;s with a Re&s;entment, that, po&s;&s;i|bly, did not become me.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="21">
May your Dignity, I replied, continue to be ble&s;&s;ed with Writers duely levelled to the Ta&s;te of the Reader, with the Poli|ticks of Court Hirelings, the Poetry of Laureats, the Divinity of a H&mdash;y; with Bawdry from the Fleet, with Fragments from the Kennel of Grub&s;treet, with Strum|pet Biography with W&mdash;upon Grace, with Treati&s;es on &mdash;, and epi&s;copal E&s;&s;ays on Spirit.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that My Patron, in Recompence for a long Life &s;pent in his Service, will pardon me the dropping of one Ob&s;ervati|on,&mdash;Nay don't look di&s;gu&s;ted,&mdash;it is no matter of great Offence, it is nothing more than this, that the No&s;e of your Re&s;pecta|blene&s;s hath ever been a ready Handle for the leading of a FOOL, and a FOOL &s;hall accordingly attend You on my next Vi&s;it.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Hate Prefaces. I never read them, and why &s;hould I write them? They &s;tand like Pales about a Park, I always overleap 'em, if I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> there is any thing, within, worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. But, what can I do? I am likely to lead a fine Life with this Performance, when People begin to quarrel with me, upon reading the fir&s;t Word, of the fir&s;t Page, of my Works.</P>
<P>This Friend, and that Friend, and t'o|ther Friend a&s;ks me, and here &s;its Ano|ther, who is mighty curious to know, why I entitle my Hero the FOOL OF QUALITY.</P>
<P>Pray, was it not more decent to impute Folly to one Man, than to Mankind, if I found my&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing the One or the Other?</P>
<P>Perhaps I call him a Fool, in Complai|&s;ance to a World that will, certainly, ho|nour him with the &s;ame Title, when they find his Wi&s;dom of a Size not &s;uited to their Own &mdash; Why, pray, what is Wi&s;|dom? &mdash; Tell me, fir&s;t, what is Folly. I will, then, tell you what is Wi&s;dom, if I find any Smattering of it in your Defini|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="23">
I wonder, was there ever an Age of Wi&s;dom, or a Land of Wi&s;dom? &mdash; Look about You. The World will an|&s;wer for It&s;elf. &mdash; Does not every Age and Nation grow wi&s;er and wi&s;er? And have not all Fathers, from the Flood downward, been accounted, no better than Fools, by their Po&s;terity? &mdash; I wi&s;h I had not been born for &s;ome Centuries to come. What a Prodigy of Wi&s;dom &s;hould I then be, in compari&s;on of what I am, at this Day.</P>
<P>Indeed, I &s;hould be glad to be wi&s;e, if I thought I could get any thing by It &mdash; Right, that is all the U&s;e that the World makes of It; it is the very End, Purpo&s;e, Goal, and Bu&s;ine&s;s of all the Wi&s;dom up|on Earth &mdash; If a Man has length enough of Sen&s;e to outreach all about him, by a Yard and a Half; He is, by a Yard and Half, wi&s;er than all his Neighbours.</P>
<P>But, was not <HI>Solomon</HI> then a Fool to ne|glect Riches, which he might have had with a Wi&s;h: and to a&s;k for Wi&s;dom, who&s;e only U&s;e is the obtaining of Riches? Was not this wi&s;hing to mend a round|about Road, when a Quarter of an Hour would have carried him, by a &s;hort Cut, to the End of his Journey? &mdash; I fancy, my dear Friend, it would be no great Matter of additional Burden to take the Folly of <HI>Solomon</HI> upon your own Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="24">
For, in ca&s;e he had taken the Riches, how the pox &s;hould he keep them, while any neighbouring Power was wi&s;er than him&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> was not five Years younger than <HI>Solomon,</HI> when he, al&s;o, might have cho|&s;en either Riches or Wi&s;dom, and yet preferred a pretty Wench to the One and to the Other. I am not &s;o young as <HI>Paris,</HI> by five times five Years, and would, therefore, prefer the One or the Other to the Wench &mdash; You then allow that <HI>Paris</HI> was a Blockhead in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e &mdash; Sir, I allow any Man to be &s;o, in every Ca&s;e, where he happens to differ in Opinion from my&s;elf&mdash; Why pray, &s;age Sir, have You got all the Wi&s;dom of the World to your&s;elf, or what Quantity thereof, think you, may there be upon Earth? &mdash; Le&s;s, by five Scruples, than any Man in judiciary Robes and a full bottom'd Wig, conceives to have fallen to his own Share. &mdash; But Folly you take to be multiplied and various &mdash; Of two Sorts, quoth an eminent Author, That which belongs to the Writer, and That which belongs to the Reader of the&s;e Works.</P>
<P>Sir, this is wild Di&s;cour&s;e, and very wide from the Purpo&s;e. Let me tell you the World was never &s;o wi&s;e as now. It is filled with Men of deep Erudition, and

<P>Fifty and five Pilgrims met, one Even|ing, at a great Inn, that led to more Roads than there are Points in the Com|pa&s;s. They &s;upped merrily together, in a large Hall; and found, upon enquiry, that they were, all, bound to <HI>the Ca&s;tle of final Repo&s;e,</HI> appointed for the Reception of the Sons of Science. When the Cloth was removed; Gentlemen, quoth the Pilgrim who fir&s;t entered, I rejoice to be joined, by &s;o much good Company, on the&s;e my honourable Travels; and, I am &s;till better plea&s;ed to have it in my Power to conduct every Man of ye, the &s;horte&s;t and &s;ure&s;t way, to your Journey's End. Here, Gen|tlemen, here is my Map of infallible Di|rections, the mo&s;t accurate Extract, that ever was taken, of all Inquiries, Ob&s;erva|tions,
<PB N="xxv" REF="26">and Informations for the Nonce. Pardon me, Brother, &s;aid the Pilgrim who &s;at next, your Map mu&s;t be erroneous by, at lea&s;t, five Degrees; by five, did I &s;ay? by &s;even, as I hope to get to my Journey's end. Look here at my Map, and believe your own Eyes. I'll be damned, cried a third Pilgrim, (peering over the Maps of his Neighbours, and taking out his own Parchment) I'll be damned if the Geographers, who de&s;igned the One or the Other, were any better than Adventurers; They never reached the Place of De&s;tination I'll be &s;worn. Gentlemen, &s;aid a Fourth, with wonderful good Temper, I do not &s;wear; but I have, critically, remarked all the Charts pro|duced. There's a blind Beggar, in our Town, who is led by his Dog, and, if he does not arrive, at the Place we are bound to, with better Speed, and greater Cer|tainty, than any of you Three; I give my&s;elf, do ye &s;ee, and all my Goods to the Devil, &s;ave a &s;mall Perpetuity, in Re|mainder, to my Son. That may be, ex|claimed a Fifth, but, look ye here, my Friends, here are the Quotations, here are the Authorities. Authorities! quoth a Sixth, a Fiddle&s;tick for a Hobby! are they unque&s;tionable, una&s;&s;ailable, like the&s;e in my Hand? Thus, every Man's Chart, throughout the Fifty and Five, was, like the Hand of the Son of <HI>Hagar,</HI> again&s;t the
<PB N="xxvi" REF="27">Chart of every Man. Each in&s;i&s;ted on be|ing accompanied, in his own Way, as a Matter of mere Charity to all the Re&s;t. They &s;et out, the next Morning, on as many different Roads as there were Per|&s;ons at Table; and, yet, no One of them ever arrived at the Place propo&s;ed, if any Dependence may be had on tho&s;e cu&s;to|mary Po&s;ts, whom the World, from Age to Age, has paid for Intelligence.</P>
<P>I don't clearly apprehend the Applicati|on of your Story, &mdash; If that is not your Fault, it mu&s;t be my Own. It is at lea&s;t a Dozen of the Twelve Labours to beat any thing into the Head of &s;ome People. &mdash; I will give you the Chance of another Tale.</P>
<P>A certain Prince &s;ent an Invitation, to two di&s;tant Per&s;onages, to come to his Court. He, further, &s;ent &s;uch Directions as could not be mi&s;taken by any One, living, who was willing to find the Way. And he, further, &s;ent a written Promi&s;e, &s;igned, and &s;ealed by the Seal royal, of the mo&s;t happy Accommodations, upon their Arrival.</P>
<P>The One, of the Parties invited, was a purblind Man who, barely, &s;aw &s;ufficient to di&s;cern his Road. He, accordingly, was fearful of Error. He cautiou&s;ly, held on his Way; and, thereby, reached his Journey's End, the Place of happy De&s;tination to which he was appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="xxvii" REF="28">
The other was a Man who had all his Eyes about him; but, he was a Genius, had va&s;t Invention, and thought it a Di&s;|paragement to tread in any Path that had been beaten by others. He was for con|triving &s;hort Cuts, and opening new Di&s;|coveries. He made Excur&s;ions on all Hands. He grew impatient of the Ac|commodations, appointed and re&s;erved for him, at the Court of the Prince. He ex|pected them on his Journey, and &s;ought for them at every Turn. He found them not. He, therefore, travelled and &s;trayed this way, and that way, in Search of them. This led him, &s;till, further and further from his Road. Till, maimed by Acci|dent, and &s;tiff with Age, he grew, equal|ly, a&s;hamed and unable to return.</P>
<P>&mdash; As plain as my No&s;e &mdash; You can the readier follow &mdash; But, talk to me, no more, about the World and its Wi&s;dom. I dete&s;t Wi&s;dom, I avoid it, I would not be bit by it. It is the <HI>Taran|tula</HI> that &s;pins a Web, whereby Innocence is entangled. It is a Politician who opens a Gulph for the Swallowing up of a People. It is a Lawyer who diggs a Grave for the Burial of Equity. It is the Science, of <HI>Hocus Pocus,</HI> that bids Happine&s;s come and pa&s;s, by the Virtue of Cups and Balls. It is a Syllabub of fa&s;ting-Spittle for the Fat|tening of the <HI>Virtuo&s;i.</HI> It is a Robe with a pompous Train. A Wig &s;pread to the
<PB N="xxviii" REF="29">Rump. A Beard lengthened to the Gir|dle. It is a Ditch of Puddle, with a hoary Mantle, that will not be moved to Merriment by any Wind that blows. It is an A&s;s in a Sumpter-Cloth. An Owl, &s;olemnly perched, amid&s;t &s;olemn Ruins, on a &s;olemn Night.</P>
<P>De&s;cend to me, &s;weet Folly! if thou ha&s;t not, as I &s;u&s;pect, been my con&s;tant Com|panion. Be, thou, my Si&s;ter, my Play|fellow, thou Kitten of the &s;olemn Cats of State and Learning. But, no. Thou never wert the Offspring of &s;uch &s;tupid Progenitors. Thou art ever joyous, ever young, although coeval, in Paradi&s;e with our fir&s;t Parents, ere, (a Pox upon their Ambition) they wi&s;hed for the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Pride pretends to &s;purn thee; Science affects to look down upon thee; but they &s;igh for thee when no one &s;ees, they have frowned thee away, and when they &s;eek they &s;hall not find thee. Come, Folly! for even thy Petulance and little Wickedne&s;&s;es become delightful, when thou incite&s;t the yeanling Kids and cooing Turtles to Combat. Thou art not captious, thou art not te&s;ty, they laugh at thee, and thou laughe&s;t with them for Company. The Hours dance before thee, the Graces &s;mile in thy Train. Thou art a Companion for Conquerors, a Play-fel|low for crowned Heads. But, alas! thou art not re&s;pected, as heretofore; when the
<PB N="xxix" REF="30">Monarch of all A&s;ia &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;adors to wait upon thee, they came, with a mighty Train, even from <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> unto <HI>Laconia,</HI> to &s;ee thee riding upon Switches, with <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> and his little Son.</P>
<P>By &mdash; my plea&s;ant Friend, thou al|mo&s;t per&s;uade&s;t me to be a Fool, during the Remainder of my Pilgrimage through the Wi&s;dom of this World. But, is there no &s;uch thing as true Wi&s;dom in Nature? &mdash; Sir, I have written a whole Chapter upon the Subject; but it lies a great way on, toward the End of my Book, and you have much Folly to wade through, before you come at it. &mdash; Give me a Peep, I be&s;eech you. &mdash; No Sir, you &s;hall not anticipate. Do you Want to be in Port, without making any Voyage? &mdash; If I mu&s;t win my way to Wi&s;dom, Inch by Inch, let me &s;et out directly. &mdash; Here then, begin.

<HEAD>THE FOOL of Quality, OR, THE HISTORY OF HENRY EARL of <HI>Moreland.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>_RICHARD the Grandfather of our Hero, was ennobled by <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t. He married a lovely Girl of the ancient Family of the <HI>Goodalls</HI> in the County of <HI>Surry,</HI> and, at Seven Years Di&s;|tance had two Sons, <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Henry;</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="32">but dying early, in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, he bequeathed &pound;12000 to his younge&s;t, and near &pound;20000 annual In|come to his elde&s;t Son; not in any per&s;o|nal Preference to his Brother, but as one who was to &s;upport the Name and Ho|nours of the Family. He appointed his Brother in Law Executor and Guardian, who, educating the Children agreeable to their different Fortunes and Pro&s;pects in Life, in about Seven Years after the Death of their Father, &s;ent <HI>Richard</HI> with a Tutor to take the Tour of Europe, and bound <HI>Henry</HI> Apprentice to a con&s;iderable <HI>London</HI> Merchant.</P>
<P>During the Travels of the One and the Apprentice&s;hip of the Other, the Troubles happened, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> a&s;&s;um'd the Re|gency; before the Fortune of the <HI>More|lands</HI> could be forfeited or endangered, by &s;iding with the Crown or the Common|wealth.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> return'd to <HI>England</HI> a &s;hort time before the Re&s;toration; and being too gay and too di&s;&s;olute for the Plodding and Hy|pocricy of <HI>Cromwell</HI> and his Fanaticks, he withdrew to the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e of his Forefathers.</P>
<P>On his Landing he had inquired for his Brother <HI>Henry;</HI> but hearing that he was
<PB N="33" REF="33">lately married, and wholely ab&s;orbed in Matters of Merchandi&s;e, as he had the ut|mo&s;t Contempt for all Cits and Traders, he took no further Notice of him.</P>
<P>In the Country, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with his Bottle, Hounds, Hawks, Race Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in debauching the Per&s;ons of the neighbouring Wenches, and corrupting the Morals of the Neighbouring Squires. But, on the Re&s;toration of his Maje&s;ty, of plea&s;urable Memory, he ha&s;tened to Court, where he rolled away and &s;hone as in his native Sphere. He was always of the Party of the King, <HI>Roche&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI> where Virtue was laughed out of Countenance, and where all Manner of Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s became amiable and recommendable by the Bur&s;ts of Merriment and Ze&s;t of Wit. But toward the latter End of this droll Reign, Earl <HI>Richard,</HI> being advanced in Age, and being &s;till older in Con&s;titution than Years, began to think of providing an Heir to his E&s;tate; and, as he had ta|ken va&s;t Pains to impair it, he married a Citizen's Daughter who wanted a Title, and with her got a Portion of one hundred thou&s;and Pounds, which was equally want|ing on his Part.</P>
<P>With his Lady he, again, retreated to the Country, where, in le&s;s than a Year,
<PB N="34" REF="34">&s;he made him the exulting Father of a fine Boy; whom he called <HI>Richard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Richard,</HI> &s;peedily, became the &s;ole Cen|tre of all his Mother's Solicitudes and Af|fections. And though, within the Space of the two &s;ucceeding Years, &s;he was deliver|ed of a &s;econd Boy, yet, as his infant A&s;|pect was le&s;s promi&s;ing and more unform|ed than his Brother's, &s;he &s;ent him forth to be nur&s;ed by the robu&s;t Wife of a neighbouring Farmer, where, for the Space of upward of four Years, he was honoured with no Token from Father or Mother, &s;ave &s;ome ca&s;ual Me&s;&s;ages, to know from time to time if the Child was in Health.</P>
<P>This Boy was called <HI>Henry,</HI> after his Uncle by the Father's Side. The Earl had lately &s;ent, to <HI>London,</HI> to make Enquiry after his Brother, but could learn no Manner of Tidings concerning him.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Education of the two Children was extremely contra&s;ted. <HI>Ri|chard,</HI> who was already entitled my little Lord, was not permitted to breathe the Rudene&s;s of the Wind. On his lighte&s;t Indi&s;po&s;ition the whole Hou&s;e was in Alarms; his Pa&s;&s;ions had full Scope in all their infant Irregularities; his Genius was put into a Hot Bed, by the Warmth of
<PB N="35" REF="35">Applau&s;es given to every Flight of his opening Fancy; and the whole Family con|&s;pired, from the Highe&s;t to the Lowe&s;t, to the Ruin of promi&s;ing Talents and a be|nevolent Heart.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Harry,</HI> on the other Hand, had every Member as well as Feature expo&s;ed to all Weathers, would run about, Mo|ther-naked for near an Hour, in a fro&s;ty Morning; was neither phy&s;icked into De|licacy, nor flattered into Pride; &s;carce felt the Convenience, and, much le&s;s under|&s;tood the Vanity of Clothing; and was daily occupied, in playing and wre&s;tling with the Pigs and two mungril Spaniels on the Dunghil; or in ki&s;&s;ing, &s;cratching, or boxing with the Children of the Village.</P>
<P>When <HI>Harry</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed his fifth Year, his Father, on a fe&s;tival Day, humbly pro|po&s;ed to &s;end for him to his Nur&s;es, in or|der to ob&s;erve how the Boy might turn out, and my Lady, in a Fit of good Humour, a&s;&s;ented. Nur&s;e, accordingly, deck'd him out in his holiday Petticoats, and walked with our Hero to the great Hou&s;e, as they called it.</P>
<P>A brilliant Concour&s;e of the neighbour|ing Gentry were met in a va&s;t Parlour,
<PB N="36" REF="36">that appeared to be executed after the Model of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</HI></P>
<P>There was Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Cloudy,</HI> who knew much but &s;aid nothing; with his very conver&s;able Lady, who &s;carce knew by halves, but &s;poke by whole&s;ale. In the &s;ame Range was Sir <HI>Standi&s;h Stately,</HI> who in all Companies held the fir&s;t Place, in his own E&s;teem. Next to him &s;at Lady <HI>Childi&s;h;</HI> it was at lea&s;t thirty Years &s;ince tho&s;e Follies might have become her which appeared &s;o very ridiculous at the Age of fifty-five. By her Side were the two <HI>Stiltons,</HI> a blind Man would &s;wear that the One was a Clown, and the Other a Gentleman, by the Tones of their Voices. Next to the&s;e were two Pair of very ill mated Turtles; Mr. <HI>Gentle,</HI> who &s;acrificed his fine Sen&s;e and affluent Fortune to the Vanity and bad Temper of a &s;illy and tur|bulent Wife; and Squire <HI>Sulky,</HI> a brutal Fool, who tyranized over the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble and mo&s;t amiable of her Sex.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite Side was Lord <HI>Prim,</HI> who evidently labour'd hard to be ea&s;y in Conver&s;ation; and next to him was Lord <HI>Flippant</HI> who &s;poke Non&s;en&s;e with great fa|cility. By his Side &s;at the fair but de|jected Mi&s;s <HI>Willow,</HI> &s;he had lately di&s;co|vered what a Misfortune it was to be born to Wit, Beauty, and Affluence, the three
<PB N="37" REF="37">capital Qualifications that lead the Sex to Calamity. Next to her was Colonel <HI>Jolly,</HI> with a Heart ever tuned to Merriment and Lungs to Laughter; had he known how to time his Fits, the Laugh might have grown catching. Below him was &s;eated Mrs. <HI>Mirror</HI> a Widow Lady, indu&s;triou&s;ly ac|compli&s;hed in the Faults of People of Fa&s;hion. And below her &s;at the beloved and re&s;pected Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> who always &s;ought to hide behind the Merits of the Company. Next to him was Major <HI>Settle,</HI> no one &s;poke with more Importance on things of no Signification. And be&s;ide him &s;at Mi&s;s <HI>Lovely,</HI> who looked Sentiment, and, while &s;he was &s;ilent, in&s;pired others with Sen&s;e and Virtue.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal Characters. The Re&s;t could not be &s;aid to be of any Character at all. The Cloth had been lately removed, and a Ho&s;t of Gla&s;&s;es and Decanters glow'd on the Table, when in comes young <HI>Harry</HI> e&s;corted by his Nur&s;e.</P>
<P>All the Eyes of the Company were, in|&s;tantly, drawn upon him, but he advanc|ed, with a vacant and unob&s;erving Phi|&s;iognimy, and thought no higher of the A&s;&s;embly than as of &s;o many Pea&s;ants at a Country Wake.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="38">
<HI>Dicky,</HI> my Dear, &s;ays my Lady, go and welcome your Brother, whereat <HI>Dick</HI> went up, took <HI>Harry</HI> by the Hand, and ki&s;&s;ed him with much Affection. <HI>Harry</HI> there|upon having eyed his Brother, I don't know You, &s;aid he, bluntly, but, at the &s;ame time held up his little Mouth to ki&s;s him again.</P>
<P><HI>Dick,</HI> &s;ays my Lady, put your laced Hat upon <HI>Harry,</HI> till we &s;ee how it becomes him, which he immediately did; but <HI>Harry,</HI> feeling an unu&s;ual Incumbrance on his Head, took off the Hat, and having for &s;ome time looked contemptuou&s;ly at it, he ca&s;t it from him with a &s;udden and agile Jerk, as he u&s;ed to ca&s;t flat Stones, in order to make Ducks and Drakes in the Mill Pond. The Hat took the Gla&s;l|es and Decanters in full Carrier, &s;ma&s;h go the Gla&s;&s;es, abroad pours the Wine on circling Laces, Dre&s;den Aprons, &s;ilver'd Silks, and rich Brocades; female Screams fill the Parlour, the Rout is equal to the Uproar, and it was long ere mo&s;t of them could be compo&s;ed to their Places.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>Harry</HI> took no kind of Intere&s;t in their Outcries or Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but &s;pying a large <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pointer that, ju&s;t then came from under the Table, he &s;prung at him like Lightning, &s;eized him
<PB N="39" REF="39">by the Collar, and vaulted on his Back with inconceivable Agility. The Dog, wholly di&s;concerted by &s;o unacu&s;tomed a Burden, capered and plunged about in a violent Manner, but <HI>Harry</HI> was a better Hor&s;eman than to be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;mounted; whereon the Dog grew outragious, and ru&s;hing into a Group of little Mi&s;&s;es and Ma&s;ters, the Children of the Vi&s;itants, he overthrew them like Ninepins; thence proceeding, with equal Rapidity, between the Legs of Mrs. <HI>Dowdy,</HI> a very fat and el|derly Lady, &s;he in&s;tantly fell backward with a violent Shriek, and, in her Fall, unfortunately overthrew <HI>Frank</HI> the Fox|hunter, who overthrew <HI>Andrew</HI> the An|gler, who overthrew <HI>Bob</HI> the Beau, who clo&s;ed the Cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Our Hero, mean Time, was happily di&s;mounted by the intercepting Petticoats, and fairly laid, without Damage, in the fallen Lady's Lap. From thence he aro&s;e at his Lei&s;ure, and &s;trolled about the Room, with as unconcerned an A&s;pect as if nothing had happen'd ami&s;s, and as tho' he had neither Act nor Part in this fright|ful Di&s;comfiture.</P>
<P>When Matters were once more, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;et to Rights, my Heavens! ex|claimed my Lady, I &s;hall faint, the Boy is po&s;itively an Ideot, he has no Appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="40" REF="40">Conception of Per&s;ons or Things. Come hither, Sirrah, &s;he cried with an an|gry Tone; but, in&s;tead of complying, <HI>Harry</HI> ca&s;t on her a Look of Re&s;entment and &s;idled over toward his Nur&s;e. <HI>Dicky,</HI> my Dear, &s;aid my Lady, go and pretend to beat his Fo&s;ter Mother, that we may try if the Child has any kind of Ideas. Here, her Lady&s;hip, by ill Fortune, was as much unadvi&s;ed, as her Favourite was unhappy in the Execution of her Orders, for while <HI>Dick</HI> &s;truck at the Nur&s;e with a counterfeited Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Harry,</HI> in&s;tantly, reddened, and gave his Brother &s;uch a &s;udden. Pa&s;h in the Face, that his No&s;e and Mouth gu&s;hed out with Blood. <HI>Dick</HI> &s;et up the Roar, my Lady &s;creamed out, and ri&s;ing and running at <HI>Harry</HI> with all imaginable Fury, &s;he caught him up, as a <HI>Falcon</HI> would tru&s;s a <HI>Robin;</HI> turned over his Petticoats, and cha&s;ti&s;ed him with all the Violence of which her Delicacy was capable. Our Hero, however, neither ut|tered Cry or Tear, but, being &s;et down, he turned round on the Company an Eye of Indignation, then cried, come away, Mammy, and i&s;&s;ued from the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had &s;carce made his Exit when his Mother exclaimed after him, Ay, ay, take him away Nur&s;e, take him away, the little Devil, and never let me &s;ee his Face more.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="41">
I &s;hall not detain my Readers with a tedious Detail of the many and differing Opinions that the remaining Company ex|pre&s;&s;ed with regard to our Hero; let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve that they generally a|greed that, tho' the Boy did not appear to be endowed by Nature, with a &s;ingle Faculty of the <HI>Animal rationale,</HI> he might, neverthele&s;s, be rendered capable in Time, of many Places of very honourable and lucrative Employment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> alone, though &s;o gentle and complying at other Times, now pre|&s;umed to di&s;&s;ent from the Sen&s;e of the Com|pany. I rather hold, &s;aid he, that this In|fant is the Promi&s;e of the greate&s;t Philo&s;o|pher and Hero that our Age is likely to produce. By refu&s;ing his Re&s;pect to tho&s;e &s;uperficial Di&s;tinctions, which Fa&s;hion has inadequately &s;ub&s;tituted as Expre&s;&s;ions of human Greatne&s;s, he approves him&s;elf the Philo&s;opher; and, by the Quickne&s;s of his Feelings for injured Innocence, and his Boldne&s;s in defending tho&s;e to whom his Heart is attached, he approves him&s;elf at once the Hero and the Man.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had now remained &s;ix Months more with his Nur&s;e, engaged in his cu&s;|tomary Exerci&s;es and Occupations. He was already, by his Courage, his Strength,
<PB N="42" REF="42">and Action, become tremendous to all the little Boys of the Village, they had all Things to fear from his &s;udden Re&s;ent|ment, but, nothing from his Memory or Recollection of a Wrong, and this al&s;o was imputed to his native Stupidity. The two mungril Dogs were his in&s;e|parable Play-fellows, they were all tied together in the &s;tricte&s;t Bonds of Friend|&s;hip, and care&s;&s;ed each other with the mo&s;t warm and unfeigned Affection.</P>
<P>On a Summer's Day as he &s;trolled forth with the&s;e his faithful Attendants, and rambled into a Park who&s;e Gate he &s;aw open, he perceived in a little Cop&s;e that bordered on a Fi&s;hpond, a Stranger &s;eated on a Bench of Turf. <HI>Harry</HI> drew near with his u&s;ual Intrepidity, till he ob|&s;erved that the Man had a reverend Beard that &s;pread over his Brea&s;t, that he held &s;omething in his Hand on which he gazed with a fixed Attention, and that the Tears rolled down his Cheeks, without cea&s;ing, and in Silence, except the half &s;uppre&s;s'd Sobs that often broke from his Bo&s;om. <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tood, awhile, immoveable, his lit|tle Heart was affected, he approached the old Man with a gentle Reverence, and looking up in his Face, and &s;eating him|&s;elf by his Side, the Mu&s;cles of his Infant A&s;pect began to relax, and he wept and &s;ob'd as fa&s;t as his Companion.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="43">
<HI>Friend.</HI>&mdash;Pray, who is this ancient Stranger? I have a great Curio&s;ity to know. Is he nece&s;&s;ary to your Story, is he to have any future Connection with the Child? How came he by the long Beard? Beards were not the Fa&s;hion in tho&s;e Days. There mu&s;t be &s;ome extraordinary Rea&s;on for it, if there is any Rea&s;on at all. Is his Story long, do you begin up|on it directly? It is a great fault in Au|thors to hold their Readers in Su&s;pence; our Curio&s;ity grows languid; twenty to one it is vani&s;hed, before you begin to give it any Kind of Satisfaction. Who in the World is he, what Bu&s;ine&s;s has he here?</P>
<P><HI>Author.</HI>&mdash;Sir, you &s;ee he is a Stranger; I have mentioned him as &s;uch. If he chu&s;es to continue &s;o, for &s;ome Time lon|ger, I know of no right that I have to di&s;cover him. Perhaps I am the only Per&s;on breathing whom he has entru&s;ted with the Secret of his Affairs; I am upon Honour not to betray him; you mu&s;t par|don me&mdash;pray proceeed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE old Gentleman turned and gaz|ed at the Child, as on &s;ome &s;udden Apparition. His Tears &s;topped. He re|turned the Picture, which he held, into his Bo&s;om. And, lifting up his Eyes, Great Power, he cried, is this the One, of all the World, who has any Feelings for me? Is it this Babe, this Suckling, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, to be a Partaker in my Grie&s;s, and the Sharer of my Afflicti|ons? Welcome, then, my little Friend, &s;aid he, tenderly turning and care&s;&s;ing the Child, I will live the longer for thy Sake, and endeavour to repay the Tears thou ha&s;t &s;hed in my Behalf.</P>
<P>The Language of true Love is under|&s;tood by all Creatures, and was that of which <HI>Harry</HI> had, almo&s;t, the only Per|ception. He returned his Friend's Care&s;&s;es with unaffected Ardour, and no Two could be more highly gratified in the En|dearments of each Other.</P>
<P>What is your Name, my Dear? &s;aid the old Gentleman. <HI>Harry Clinton,</HI> Sir. <HI>Harry Clinton!</HI> repeated the Old Man, and &s;tarted. And pray who is your Fa|ther? the Child, then looking tenderly at
<PB N="45" REF="45">him, replied; I'll have you for a Father, if you plea&s;e, Sir. The Stranger, then caught him up in his Arms, and pa&s;&s;io|nately exclaim'd, You &s;hall, you &s;hall, my Darling, for the tendere&s;t of Fathers, ne|ver to be torn a&s;under, till Death &s;hall part us.</P>
<P>Then a&s;king him where he lived, and <HI>Harry</HI> pointing to the Town before them, they both got up and went towards it. Our Hero was now again all Glee, all Action; he &s;prung from and to his Friend, and play'd and gambol'd about him, like a young Spaniel in a Morning, ju&s;t loos'd from his Chain, and admitted to accompany his Ma&s;ter to the Field. As his two Dogs fri&s;ked about him, he would now mount upon One, then bound upon t'other, and each pranced and pa|raded under him as delighted with the Burden. The old Gentleman beheld all with a Plea&s;ure that had long been a Stran|ger to his Brea&s;t, and &s;hared in the Joys of his young A&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>Being arrived near the Farm Hou&s;e, Nur&s;e, who &s;tood at the Door, &s;aw them approaching, and cried out, <HI>Gaffer, Gaffer,</HI> here comes our <HI>Harry</HI> with the dumb Gentleman. When they were come up. Good People, &s;ays the Stranger, is this your Child! no, no, Sir, an&s;wered the
<PB N="46" REF="46">Nur&s;e, we are but his Fo&s;terers. And, pray, who is his Father? He is &s;econd Son, Sir, to the Earl of <HI>Moreland.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Moreland!</HI> you amaze me greatly, is this all the Notice and Care they take of &s;uch a Trea&s;ure? Sir, replied the Nur&s;e, they never &s;ent for him but once; they don't mind him, they take him for a Fool. For a Fool? cried he, and &s;hook his Head in Token of Di&s;&s;ent. I am &s;ure he has the wi&s;e&s;t of all human Hearts. I wi&s;h it may be&s;o, Sir, &s;aid the Nur&s;e, but he behav|ed very &s;adly, &s;ome Time ago, at the great Hou&s;e. She then made a Recital of all our young Hero's Adventures in the Man&s;ion-Parlour; whereat the old Gen|tleman inwardly chuckled, and, for the fir&s;t Time, of &s;ome Years, permitted his Features to relax into a Smile of Chear|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nur&s;e, &s;aid he, every Thing that I hear and &s;ee of this Child &s;erves the more to endear and bind me to him. Pray, be &s;o good as to accompany us to my Hou&s;e, we will try to equip him better both as to Per&s;on and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>As this Stranger's Seat made Part of the Village, they were &s;oon there. He fir&s;t whi&s;pered his old Dome&s;tic, who, then, looked upon the Child with Surpri&s;e and Plea&s;ure. The Footman was next &s;ent to
<PB N="47" REF="47">bring the Taylor, and &s;ome light Stuffs from the Town Shop. Matters being thus di&s;|patched, with re&s;pect to our Hero's fir&s;t Coat and Britches, Nur&s;e was kept to Dinner; and after this Gentleman had entertained his young Gue&s;t with a Variety of little Tricks, childi&s;h Plays, and other-Fooleries; toward Evening, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him and his Nur&s;e, with a Reque&s;t that &s;he would &s;end him every Day, and a Promi&s;e that he &s;hould be returned every Night if &s;he de&s;ired it.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> being thus furni&s;hed with the external Tokens of a Man Child, having been born into the World, became an in|&s;eparable Friend and Play-fellow to his Patron. At Times of Relaxation, the old Gentleman, with the mo&s;t winning and in&s;inuating Addre&s;s, endeavoured to open his Mind and cultivate his Morals, by a thou&s;and little Fables, &s;uch as of bold Sparrows, and naughty Kids, that were carried away by the Hawk, or devoured by the Wolf, and of good Robbins, and innocent Lambs, that the very Hawks and Wolves, them&s;elves, were fond of. For he never propo&s;ed any Encouragement or Re|ward to the Heart of our Hero, &s;ave that of the Love and Approbation of Others. At the Times of &s;uch In&s;truction, <HI>Harry,</HI> who knew no other Dependence, and beheld his Patron as his Father and as his God, would hang upon his Knee, look up to his
<PB N="48" REF="48">Face, delighted, and greedily imbibe the Sweetne&s;s of tho&s;e Le&s;&s;ons who&s;e Impre&s;&s;i|ons neither Age, nor any Occurrence, could ever after era&s;e; &s;o prevalent are the Dictates of Lips that are beloved.</P>
<P>At other Times, the Stranger would enter, with our Hero, into all his little Frolicks and childi&s;h Vagaries, would run and wre&s;tle with him, ride the Rods, roll down the Slope, and never felt &s;uch &s;weet Sen&s;ations and inward Delight, as when he was engaged in &s;uch Recreations.</P>
<P>There was a Cock at <HI>Harry</HI>'s Nur&s;es, the Lord of the Dunghill, between whom and our Hero a very particular Intimacy and Friend&s;hip had been contracted. <HI>Harry</HI>'s Hand was his daily Caterer; and <HI>Dick,</HI> for the Cock was &s;o called, would hop into the Child's Lap and pick his Cloaths, and rub his Feathers again&s;t him, and court <HI>Harry</HI> to tickle and &s;troak and play with him.</P>
<P>Upon a <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day,</HI> while <HI>Harry</HI> was on his Road, from his Patron's, in|tending a &s;hort Vi&s;it to his Nur&s;e and Fo&s;|ter Father, a Lad came to their Door and offer'd <HI>Gaffer</HI> a double Price for <HI>Dick;</HI> the Bargain was quickly made, the Lad bore off his Prize in Triumph, and <HI>Gaffer</HI> with|drew to the manuring of a back Field. Ju&s;t at that Cri&s;is <HI>Harry</HI> came up, and
<PB N="49" REF="49">enquired of the Maid for his Daddy and Mammy, but was an&s;wered that neither of them was within. He then a&s;ked after his favourite Cock, but was told that his Daddy had, that Minute, &s;old him to yonder Man who was almo&s;t out of Sight.</P>
<P>Away &s;prung our Hero, like an Arrow from a Bow, and held the Man in View till he &s;aw him enter a great Croud, at the upper end of the Street. Up he comes, at la&s;t, quite out of Breath, and making way through the A&s;&s;embly, per|ceived his Cock, at &s;ome Di&s;tance, tied to a &s;hort Stake, and a Lad preparing to throw at him with a Stick. Forward he ru&s;hed, again, and &s;topped re&s;olutely be|fore his Bird, to ward the Blow with his own Per&s;on, at the In&s;tant that the Stick had taken its Flight, and that all the Peo|ple cry'd out, hold! hold! One End of the Stick took <HI>Harry</HI> in the left Shoulder, and brui&s;ed him &s;orely; but, not regarding that, he in&s;tantly &s;tooped, delivered his captive Favourite, whipt him under his Arm, caught up the Stick, flouri&s;h'd it, as in Defiance of all Opponents, made Homeward thro' the Croud, and was fol|lowed by the Acclamations of the whole A&s;&s;emby.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman was &s;tanding before his Court Door when his Favourite arriv|ed,
<PB N="50" REF="50">all in a Sweat; what's the Matter, my Dear, &s;ays he, what made you put your|&s;elf into &s;uch a Heat? what Cock is that you have under your Arm? In an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;everal Que&s;tions <HI>Harry</HI> ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed the whole Affair. And, when his Patron with &s;ome Warmth, cried, why, my Love, did you venture your Life for a &s;illy Cock? why did I? repeated the Child, why Sir, becau&s;e he loved me. The Stranger, then, &s;tepping back and gazing upon him with Eyes of tender Admirati|on; may Heaven for ever ble&s;s thee, my little Angel, he exclaimed, and continue to utter from thy Lips the Sentiments that it In&s;pires. Then, catching him up in his Arms, he bathed him with his Tears, and almo&s;t, &s;tifled him with his Care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In a few Days, our Hero was again re&s;tored, by frequent Fomentations, to the U&s;e of his Arm; and his Dada, as he called him, and he returned to their old Recreations.</P>
<P>As <HI>Harry</HI>'s Ideas began to open and expand, he grew ambitious of greater Power and Knowledge. He wi&s;hed for the Strength of that Bull, and for the Swiftne&s;s of yonder Hor&s;e. And, on the Clo&s;e of a &s;olemn and &s;erene Summer's Evening, while he and his Patron walked
<PB N="51" REF="51">in the Garden, he wi&s;hed for Wings that he might fly up and &s;ee what the Sky, and the Stars, and the ri&s;ing Moon were made of.</P>
<P>In order to reform this Inordinacy of his De&s;ires, his Patron addre&s;&s;ed him in the following Manner.</P>
<P>I will tell you a Story, my <HI>Harry.</HI> On the other Side of yonder Hill there runs a mighty clear River, and in that River, on a Time, there lived three &s;ilver Trouts, the prettie&s;t little Fi&s;hes that any one ever &s;aw. Now God took a great liking and love to the&s;e pretty &s;ilver Trouts, and he let them want for nothing that &s;uch little Fi&s;hes could have occa&s;ion for. But two of them grew &s;ad and di&s;contented; and the One wi&s;hed for this Thing, and the Other wi&s;hed for that Thing, and neither of them could take Plea&s;ure in any Thing that they had, becau&s;e they were always longing for &s;omething that they had not.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Harry,</HI> you mu&s;t know that all this was very naughty in tho&s;e two little Trouts; for God had been exceedingly kind to them; he had given them every Thing that was fitte&s;t for them; and he never grudged them any Thing that was for their Good; but in&s;tead of thanking him for all his Care and his Kindne&s;s, they
<PB N="52" REF="52">blamed him, in their own Minds, for re|fu&s;ing them any Thing that their &s;illy Fancies were &s;et upon. In &s;hort there was no End of their wi&s;hing, and longing, and quarrelling, in their Hearts, for this Thing and t'other.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, God was &s;o provoked, that he re&s;olved to puni&s;h their Naughtine&s;s by granting their De&s;ires, and to make the Folly of tho&s;e two little &s;tubborn Trouts an Example to all the fooli&s;h Fi&s;h in the whole World.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, he called out to the three little &s;ilver Trouts, and told them they &s;hould have whatever they wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>Now, the Elde&s;t of the&s;e Trouts was a very proud little Fi&s;h, and wanted, for|&s;ooth, to be &s;et up above all other little Fi&s;hes. May it plea&s;e your Greatne&s;s, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t be free to tell you that I do not, at all, like the Way in which you have placed me. Here you have put me into a poor, narrow, and trouble&s;ome Ri|ver, where I am &s;traitened on the right Side, and &s;traitened on the left Side and can neither get down into the Ground, nor up into the Air, nor go where, nor do any one Thing I have a mind to. I am not &s;o blind, for all, but that I can &s;ee, well
<PB N="53" REF="53">enough, how mighty kind and bountiful you can be to Others. There are your favourite little Birds, who fly this Way and that Way, and mount up to the very Heavens; and do whatever they plea&s;e, and have every Thing at Command, be|cau&s;e you have given them Wings. Give me &s;uch Wings, al&s;o, as you have given to them, and then I will have &s;omething for which I ought to thank you.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner a&s;k than have. He felt the Wings he wi&s;hed for growing from either Side, and, in a Minute, he &s;pread them abroad, and ro&s;e out of the Water. At fir&s;t he felt a wonderful Plea&s;ure in finding him&s;elf able to fly. He mounted high in|to the Air, above the very Clouds, and he looked down with Scorn on all the Fi&s;hes in the World.</P>
<P>He now re&s;olved to travel, and to take his Diver&s;ion far and wide. He flew over Rivers, and Meadows, and Woods, and Mountains; till, growing faint with Hun|ger and Thir&s;t, his Wings began to fail him, and he thought it be&s;t to come down to get &s;ome Refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The little Fool did not con&s;ider that he was now in a &s;trange Country, and many a Mile from the &s;weet River, where he was born and bred, and had received all
<PB N="54" REF="54">his Nouri&s;hment. So, when he came down, he happened to alight among dry Sands and Rocks, where there was not a Bit to eat, nor a Drop of Water to drink; and &s;o there he lay faint and tired, and unable to ri&s;e, ga&s;ping, and fluttering, and beating him&s;elf again&s;t the Stones, till at length he died in great Pain and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Now, the &s;econd &s;ilver Trout, though he was not &s;o high minded as the fir&s;t little proud Trout, yet he did not want for Conceit enough, and he was moreover a narrow hearted and very &s;elfi&s;h little Trout, and, provided he him&s;elf was &s;nug and &s;afe, he did not care what became of all the Fi&s;hes in the World. So he &s;ays to God:</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Honour. I don't wi&s;h, not I, for Wings to fly out of the Water, and to ramble into &s;trange Places, where I don't know what may become of me. I lived contented and happy enough, till the other Day, when, as I got under a cool Bank from the Heat of the Sun, I &s;aw a great Rope coming down into the Water, and it fa&s;tened it&s;elf, I don't know how, about the Gills of a little Fi&s;h that was ba&s;king be&s;ide me, and he was lifted out of the Water, &s;truggling and working in great Pain, till he was carried, I know not where, quite out of my Sight. So, I
<PB N="55" REF="55">thought in my own Mind, that this Evil, &s;ome Time or other, may happen to my|&s;elf, and my Heart trembled within me, and I have been very &s;ad and di&s;contented ever &s;ince. Now, all I de&s;ire of you, is, that you would tell me the Meaning of this, and of all the other Dangers to which you have &s;ubjected us poor little mortal Fi&s;hes; for then I &s;hall have Sen&s;e enough to take care of my own Safety, and I am very well able to provide for my own Liv|ing, I warrant you.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner &s;aid than done. God imme|diately opened his Under&s;tanding; and he knew the Nature and Meaning of Snares, Nets, Hooks, and Lines, and of all the Dangers to which &s;uch little Trouts could be liable.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he greatly rejoiced in this his Knowledge; and he &s;aid to him&s;elf, now &s;urely I &s;hall be the happie&s;t of all Fi&s;hes; for, as I under&s;tand and am forewarned of every Mi&s;chief that can come near me, I'm &s;ure I love my&s;elf too well not to keep out of Harm's way.</P>
<P>From this Time forward, he took Care not to go into any deep Holes, for fear that a Pike, or &s;ome other huge Fi&s;h might be there, who would make nothing of &s;wallowing him up at one Gulph. He
<PB N="56" REF="56">al&s;o kept away from the &s;hallow Places, e&s;pecially in hot Weather, left the Sun &s;hould dry them up and not leave him Water enough to &s;wim in. When he &s;aw the Shadow of a Cloud coming and mov|ing upon the River, a ha! &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, here are the Fi&s;hermen with their Nets, and immediately he got on one Side and &s;kulked under the Banks, where he kept trembling in his Skin, till the Cloud was pa&s;t. Again when he &s;aw a Fly &s;kimming on the Water, or a Worm coming down the Stream, he did not dare to bite, however hungry he might be; no no, &s;aid he to them, my hone&s;t Friends, I am not &s;uch a Fool as that comes to neither; go your ways and tempt tho&s;e who know no better, who are not aware that you may &s;erve as Baits to &s;ome trea|cherous Hook, that lies hid for the De|&s;truction of tho&s;e ignorant and &s;illy Trouts that are not on their Guard.</P>
<P>Thus, this over careful Trout kept him&s;elf in continual Frights and Alarms, and could neither eat, nor drink, nor &s;leep in Peace, le&s;t &s;ome Mi&s;chief &s;hould be at Hand, or that he might be taken napping. He daily grew poorer, and poorer, and &s;adder, and &s;adder, for he pined away with Hunger, and &s;igh'd him|&s;elf to Skin and Bone; till, wa&s;ted almo&s;t to nothing with Care and Melancholy, he
<PB N="57" REF="57">at la&s;t died, for fear of dying, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all Deaths.</P>
<P>Now, when God came to the younge&s;t &s;ilver Trout, and a&s;ked him what he wi&s;hed for. Alas (&s;aid this darling little Trout) you know, may it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, that I am but a very fooli&s;h and good for nothing little Fi&s;h; and I don't know, not I, what is good for me or what is bad for me; and I wonder how I came to be worth bringing into the World, or what you could &s;ee in me to take any thought about me. But, if I mu&s;t wi&s;h for &s;omething, it is that you would do with me what&s;oever you think be&s;t; and that I &s;hould be plea&s;ed to live, or die, even ju&s;t as you would have me.</P>
<P>Now, as &s;oon as this precious Trout made this Prayer in his good and his humble little Heart, God took &s;uch a Liking and a Love to him, as the like was never known. And God found it in his own Heart, that he could not but take great Care of this &s;weet little Trout, who had tru&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o wholely to his Love and good Plea&s;ure, and God went where|&s;oever he went, and was always with him and about him, and was to him as a Fa|ther and Friend and Companion; and he put Contentment into his Mind and Joy
<PB N="58" REF="58">into his Heart; and &s;o this little Trout &s;lept always in Peace, and wakened in Gladne&s;s; and whether he was full or hungry, or whatever happened to him, he was &s;till pleas'd and thankful; and he was the happie&s;t of all Fi&s;hes that ever &s;wam in any Water.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> at the Clo&s;e of this Fable, looked down and grew thoughtful, and his Pa|tron left him to him&s;elf to ruminate on what he had heard Now, <HI>Harry</HI> had often heard talk of God, and had &s;ome general though confu&s;ed Notions of his Power.</P>
<P>The next Day, he reque&s;ted his Patron to repeat the Story of the Three little &s;il|ver Trouts. When he had ended, Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I believe I begin to gue&s;s a little at what you mean. You wouldn't have me wi&s;h for any Thing, but leave every Thing to God; and, if I thought that God loved me, half as well as you love, me, I would leave every Thing to him|&s;elf, like the good little Trout. He does, my <HI>Harry,</HI> he loves you a thou&s;and Times better than I love you, nay a thou&s;and Times better than you love your&s;elf. God is all Love; it is he who made every Thing, and he loves every Thing that he has made. Ay, but Dada, I can't, for the Heart of me help pitying the two poor
<PB N="59" REF="59">little naughty Trouts. If God loves every Thing, why did he make any Thing to dye? You begin to think too deeply, <HI>Harry;</HI> we will &s;peak more of the&s;e Matters ano|ther Time. For the pre&s;ent, let it &s;uffice to know that, as he can kill, he can al&s;o make alive, again, at his own Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had now remained about twelve Months with his Patron, when it was in|timated to the Earl and his Lady that the dumb Man had taken a Fancy to their Child, and, that he was almo&s;t con&s;tantly, re&s;ident at his Hou&s;e. Alarmed at this News, and apprehending that this Man might be &s;ome Impo&s;tor or Kidnapper, they, once more, &s;ent Orders to the Nur&s;e to bring the Boy home.</P>
<P>Nur&s;e run in a Hurry to the Stranger's, and, having informed him of the Nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under to take away the Child, many mutual Tears were &s;hed at Parting; but <HI>Harry</HI> was the &s;ooner pacified when Nur&s;e told him that it was but for a &s;hort Vi&s;it, as before.</P>
<P>When they came to the Ca&s;tle, there was no Company in the Parlour, but the Earl and his Lady, with Lord <HI>Richard</HI> and &s;ome other Ma&s;ters of Quality, about his Age and Size. <HI>Harry,</HI> however looked about with a Brow of Di&s;gu&s;t; and, when
<PB N="60" REF="60">my Lady de&s;ired him to come and ki&s;s her, maybe you'll whip me, he an&s;wer'd &s;ullenly; No, &s;he replied, if you don't &s;trike your Brother <HI>Dicky</HI> any more. I won't beat him, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> if he won't beat Mammy. Come then and ki&s;s me, my Dear, &s;aid my Lady, whereon <HI>Harry</HI> advanced with a &s;low Caution, and held up his little Mouth to receive her Salute. He was then ki&s;s'd by his Father, his Brother, and the little Ma&s;ters, and all Things promi&s;ed future Reconcilement and Amity.</P>
<P>A Number of glittering Toys were then pre&s;ented to <HI>Harry</HI> on all Sides; he receiv|ed them, indeed, in good Part, but laid them all a&s;ide again as Things of who&s;e U&s;e he yet was not wi&s;e enough to be ap|prehen&s;ive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lady piqued thereat, told the Earl that &s;he re&s;olved, once more to prove the Wits of the Young&s;ter in Britches; and whi&s;pering to <HI>Dicky,</HI> he im|mediately went out and took with him his Companions. Soon after, <HI>Dick</HI> returns without his Shoes, but with a pitiful Face, and cries, Brother <HI>Harry</HI> honey, I want a Pair of Shoes &s;adly, will you give me Your's? Yes, I will, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> and in|&s;tantly &s;trips and pre&s;ents them to him. Then entered another Boy and demanded his Stockings, in the like petitioning man|ner; another beg'd his Hat, another his Coat, another his Wai&s;tcoat, all of which he be&s;tow'd without He&s;itation. But, when the la&s;t Boy came in and petitioned for his Shirt; no, I won't, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> a little moody, I want a Shirt my&s;elf. My Lady then exclaimed, upon my Con&s;cience, there is but the Thickne&s;s of a bit of Linen be|tween this Child and a down right Fool. But my Lord ro&s;e up, took <HI>Harry</HI> in his Arms, and having tenderly embraced him, God ble&s;s thee, my Boy, he cried, and make thee an Honour to old <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Dinner, &s;oon after, was ordered up, and <HI>Harry</HI> permitted his Nur&s;e to retire peace|ably
<PB N="65" REF="65">to the Kitchen, during the Interval, as he and all the Ma&s;ters were then on Terms of Amity.</P>
<P>My Lady placed <HI>Harry,</HI> next her&s;elf, at Table, but no Peer ever payed &s;uch a Price at <HI>Pontac</HI>'s, as our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Hero did that Day for his Ordinary. For he mu&s;t &s;it up ju&s;t &s;o, and hold his Knife and Fork ju&s;t &s;o, and cut his Meat, and open his Mouth, and &s;wallow his Victuals ju&s;t &s;o and &s;o and &s;o. And then, between every two Words, there was to be &s;o many my Lords and my Ladies, and I thank you Sir, and I thank you Madam, and Ma&s;ter this and Ma&s;ter that, that poor <HI>Harry,</HI> no longer able to contain him&s;elf, cried, I wi&s;h I was with my Mammy in the Kitchen.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Children were &s;et to Que&s;tions and Commands. But here, our Hero was beaten hollow, as he was after|ward, at Draw Glove and Shuffle the Slip|per. They next came to Hot Cockles, and <HI>Harry,</HI> being fir&s;t down, had his left Hand well warm'd for near a Quarter of an Hour, till, more by good Luck than any good Policy, he fix'd upon a delicate little Gentleman, the Son and Heir of Lord and Lady <HI>Toilet,</HI> who lay down, ac|cordingly; when <HI>Harry,</HI> endeavouring to
<PB N="66" REF="66">&s;um all the Favours he had received in one Payment, gave Ma&s;ter &s;uch a Whirrick, that his Cries in&s;tantly &s;ounded the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> to &s;uch kind of Diver&s;ions. But <HI>Har|ry</HI> being chidden for his Rudene&s;s and ob|liged to a&s;k Pardon, all was &s;oon whole again.</P>
<P>Now, throughout the&s;e &s;everal Amu&s;e|ments, though this Group of little Qua|lity, behaved them&s;elves with great good Manners towards our Hero, yet, as my Lady's Judgment of his Intellects became current thro' the Country, and that all took him to be little removed from a Natural; the&s;e &s;mall Gentry, al&s;o, held him in the lowe&s;t Contempt, and gave them&s;elves &s;ecret Credit for the Decency of their Con|duct in his Behalf.</P>
<P>Two or three of them, however, having maliciou&s;ly contrived to &s;et him in a ridi|culous Light, prevailed upon his Brother to join in the Plot. They, accordingly, propo&s;ed a Play, wherein, <HI>Harry</HI> was en|joined to &s;tand in the Centre, for &s;o many Minutes, without Motion or Re&s;entment let his Companions do what they would about him.</P>
<P>Our Hero, con&s;equently, fixed him&s;elf to a Po&s;ture and Countenance altogether determined. The Attack in&s;tantly began.
<PB N="67" REF="67">Some grinned, &s;ome pointed, &s;ome jeered and flouted at him, &s;ome twitched him by the Hair, &s;ome pinched him by the Breech, one tweaked him by the No&s;e, and another &s;pirted Water full in his Face; but <HI>Harry</HI> bore all with the Firmne&s;s and Re&s;ignation of a Stoic Philo&s;opher; till my Lady, quite impatient, cried out, did you ever &s;ee the like; &s;uch a Stock of a Child, &s;uch a Statue? why, he has no kind of Feeling, either of Body or Mind.</P>
<P>While &s;he was pronouncing the&s;e Words, young <HI>Skinker,</HI> elde&s;t Son to a wealthy 'Squire, a chubbed unlucky Boy, about the Age of Lord <HI>Richard,</HI> put one Hand within the other and de&s;ired <HI>Harry</HI> to &s;trike thereon, which he did accordingly; but, feeling unu&s;ual Smart, and fired at the Treachery that he, ju&s;tly, conceived was in the Ca&s;e, <HI>Harry</HI> gave him &s;uch a &s;udden Fi&s;t in the Temple as drove him &s;tag|gering backward, &s;everal Steps. <HI>Skinker,</HI> wholly enraged, and con&s;cious of &s;uperior Strength, immediately returned, and with all his Might, gave <HI>Harry</HI> a Stroke on the Head, which Compliment he returned by a Punch in the Eye as rapid as Lightning. All the Boys &s;tood aloof, and amazed at the Combat. My Lady, vehemently cried out to part them. But my Lord ro&s;e and, peremptorily, commanded fair Play. Mean while, young <HI>Skinker,</HI> wholly de&s;perate to
<PB N="68" REF="68">be foiled by one &s;o much his Inferior in Strength and Under&s;tanding, flew on <HI>Har|ry</HI> like a Fury and fa&s;tened the Nails of both his Hands in his Face, from which Gripe our Hero as quickly di&s;engaged him|&s;elf, by darting his Head into the No&s;e and Mouth of his Adver&s;ary, who was in|&s;tantly covered with Blood, though his Pa&s;&s;ion would not permit him to attend to the Pain; for, exerting his la&s;t Effort, he clo&s;ed in on our little Champion, and de|termined, at once, to fini&s;h the Combat, by lifting and da&s;hing him again&s;t the Ground; but <HI>Harry</HI> finding him&s;elf going, nimbly put one Foot behind and hit <HI>Skinker</HI> in the Ham, and, at the &s;ame time pu&s;h|ing forward, with all his Force, prone fell the unfortunate <HI>Skinker</HI> precipitated by the double Weight of him&s;elf and his Antago|ni&s;t, and his Head rebounded again&s;t the Floor, while up &s;prung <HI>Harry,</HI> and with a ri&s;ing Dunt in the Stomach, put a Period to the Fray.</P>
<P>All di&s;may'd, and, wholly di&s;comforted, <HI>Skinker</HI> flowly aro&s;e, and began to puke and cry mo&s;t piteou&s;ly. His Companions then gathered about him, and, compa&s;&s;ion|ating his Plight, turned an Eye of Indigna|tion upon the Victor; all promi&s;cuou&s;ly exclaimed, O fie, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> I'm quite a&s;hamed, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> you gave the fir&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="69">Blow; it was you that gave the fir&s;t Blow, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry;</HI> to all which Reproaches <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;urlily, replied, if I gave fir&s;t Blow he gave fir&s;t Hurt.</P>
<P>Come, come, &s;aid my Lord, there mu&s;t be &s;omething more in this Affair than we are, yet, acquainted with. Come hither Ma&s;ter <HI>Skinker,</HI> tell me the Truth, my Dear, what was it you did to <HI>Harry</HI> that provoked him to &s;trike you? Indeed, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Skinker,</HI> I did not intend to Hurt him &s;o much. When I gave him one Hand to &s;trike, I held a Pin, within &s;ide in the other, but the Pin run up further than I thought for. Go, go, &s;aid my Lord, you de&s;erve what you have got. You are an ill-hearted Boy, and &s;hall not come here to play any more.</P>
<P>My Lady then called <HI>Harry,</HI> de&s;ired to look at his Hand, and found the Palm co|vered with Blood. This &s;he wa&s;hed away, and, having found the Wound, &s;he put a &s;mall bit of Black &s;ticking Silk to the Orifice, and <HI>Harry</HI> in&s;tantly held him&s;elf as &s;ound a Man as ever.</P>
<P>It was then that, in&s;tead of exulting or crowing over his Adver&s;ary, he began to relax into Melancholy and Dejection, and &s;ideling over toward <HI>Skinker,</HI> and, looking wi&s;tfully in his Face, if, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> with
<PB N="70" REF="70">a trembling Lip, if you will Ki&s;s and Friends with me, I'll never beat you any more. To this Overture <HI>Skinker</HI> was, with a &s;ullen Reluctance, per&s;uaded by his Com|panions. And, from that Moment, the Victor began to gain Ground in the Heart and good Graces both of Father and Mo|ther.</P>
<P>Night now approached, the Candles were lighted up, and the Children took a &s;hort and &s;light Repa&s;t. Ma&s;ter <HI>Dicky</HI> then, privately whi&s;pering to his Mamma, de&s;ired her not to be frighted at what &s;he might &s;ee, and immediately withdrew. In a &s;hort Time he return'd, and gathering all his little Companions into a Group, in the Centre of the Parlour, held them a while in Chat. When, O tremendous! a back Door flew open, and, in glided a mo&s;t terrifying and horrible Apparition; the Body and Limbs, from the Neck down|wards, were all wrapt in a winding Sheet; and the Head, tho' Fear could not attend to its Form, appeared wholly illuminated with Flames that glared thro' the Eyes, Mouth and No&s;trils.</P>
<P>At Sight hereof, Ma&s;ter <HI>Dicky,</HI> appear|ing the fir&s;t to be frighted, &s;creamed out, and ran behind his Mamma's Chair, as it were for Protection; the Pannick grew
<PB N="71" REF="71">in&s;tantly contagious, and all this Ho&s;t of little Gentry, who were, thereafter, to form our Senates, and to lead our Armies, ran, &s;hrieking and &s;hivering, to hide them|&s;elves in Holes and to tremble in Corners.</P>
<P>Our Hero, alone, &s;tood undaunted, tho' concerned; and, like an A&s;tronomer who, with equal Dread and Attention, contem|plates &s;ome &s;udden Phenomenon in the Heavens, which he apprehends to be &s;ent as an En&s;ign or Forerunner to the fall of mighty States, or di&s;peopling of Nations, &s;o <HI>Harry</HI> with bent and apprehen&s;ive Brows, beheld and con&s;idered the approaching Spectre.</P>
<P>He had never heard nor formed any Idea of Gho&s;ts of Hobgoblins, he there|fore &s;tood to deliberate what he had to fear from it. It &s;till advanced upon him, nor had he yet budged. When his Bro|ther cried out, from behind my Lady's Chair, beat it, <HI>Harry,</HI> beat it. On the in|&s;tant, <HI>Harry</HI> flew back to the Corner, next the Hall, and catching up his Staff, the Trophy of <HI>Shrove Tue&s;day,</HI> he return'd upon the Spectre, and, aiming a noble Blow at the illuminated Sconce, he, at once, &s;ma&s;h'd the outward Lantern; drove the Candle, Flame and all, into the Mouth of him who held it; and open'd his upper
<PB N="72" REF="72">Lip from the No&s;e to the Teeth. Out &s;pouted the Blood as from a Spiggot. The Gho&s;t clapped all the Hands that he had to his Mouth, and &s;lunk away to &s;hew to his Friends in the Kitchen, how he had been baffled and mauled by an Infant of &s;even Summers.</P>
<P>Heav'n pre&s;erve us, cried my Lady, we &s;hall have nothing but Broils and Blood&s;hed in the Hou&s;e while this Child is among us. Indeed, my Dear, replied the Earl, if there was any Thing more than mere Ac|cident in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, it was the Fault of your Favourite <HI>Dicky,</HI> who de&s;ired the Boy to &s;trike.</P>
<P>By this Time, the little Gentry came, all from their lurking Holes, though yet pale and una&s;&s;ured. And, whatever Contempt they might have for the Intel|lects of <HI>Harry,</HI> they had, now, a very &s;in|cere Veneration for his Prowe&s;s.</P>
<P>Bed Time now approaching, and all being again &s;ettled. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, you have been a very good Boy, to Day, and have joined with your Companions in all their little Plays. Now, if you have any Plays to &s;hew them I am &s;ure they will have the good Manners to do as you de|&s;ire. What &s;ay you <HI>Harry,</HI> have you any Play to &s;hew them? Yes, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="73">I have a many of them; there's fir&s;t, Leap Frog, and Thru&s;h a Thru&s;h. To it, then, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, and pray, all you little Gentlemen, do you ob&s;erve his Directions.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner &s;aid than done. <HI>Harry</HI> took his Companions, One by One, and, cau&s;|ing them to &s;toop, with their Heads to|ward the Ground in a long Line, and at certain Di&s;tances each before t'other, he returned to the Tail, and taking the Ad|vantage of a &s;hort Run to quicken his Motion, he laid his Hands on the Rump of the Hindmo&s;t, and vaulting lightly over him, he, with amazing Rapidity, flew a|long the whole Line, clearing a Man, at ev'ry Motion, till he alighted before the Foremo&s;t, and down he popt in the Po&s;|ture of tho&s;e behind.</P>
<P>My Lady, in utter A&s;toni&s;hment, lift|ing up her Hands and Eyes, exclaim'd, O the fine Creature, O the graceful Crea|ture! if there was but a Mind to match that Body, there would not be &s;uch ano|ther Boy in the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Richard,</HI> being now hindmo&s;t, was the next who adventured, and, with Acti|on enough, clear'd his two fir&s;t Men; but then having lo&s;t the Advantage of his Run, and, his Foreman being of more
<PB N="74" REF="74">than ordinary Size; he fir&s;t &s;tuck upon his Rump, and, pitching thence, broke his Forehead again&s;t the Floor. He got up however with a plea&s;ant Countenance, and, running along &s;ide the Line, &s;et him|&s;elf in his former Po&s;ture before his Bro|ther. The Hindmo&s;t then, and then the next, and the next, and &s;o onward, took their Turns, in Succe&s;&s;ion, without any better Succe&s;s. The one brui&s;ed his Shoul|der, another &s;prained his Finger, another bumpt his Head, another broke his No&s;e, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> So that, in le&s;s than five Minutes, my Lady had got an Ho&s;pital of her own, though not altogether con&s;i&s;ting of Incu|rables.</P>
<P>Now, Spirits, and Vinegar, brown Pa|per, black Plai&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were called for in a Hurry, and, the &s;everal Stupes and Dre&s;&s;|ings being &s;kilfully applied, the Children were ordered to their re&s;pective Beds, and Nur&s;e was prevailed upon to continue with <HI>Harry,</HI> till he &s;hou'd be reconciled to his new Friends and A&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Harry</HI> was become a Favourite, e&s;|pecially among the Servants who, in a manner; adored him, &s;ince the Adventure of the Box and the Hobgoblin.</P>

<P>We all &s;ee that a Spirit has va&s;t Pow|er. Nothing el&s;e in Truth can have any Power at all. We perceive, by our&s;elves and others, with what Ea&s;e it can act upon what we call Matter; how it moves, how it lifts it. Perhaps, were our Spirits detach|ed from this di&s;tempered Pri&s;on, to which
<PB N="78" REF="78">the Degeneracy of our fallen Nature has confined them, they might more ea&s;ily whirl a Mountain through the Atmo&s;phere, than they can now ca&s;t a Pebble into the Air. The Con&s;ideration of this Power, when joined to Malevolence, as is generally the Ca&s;e, becomes very tremendous. The Stories told by Nur&s;es and Go&s;&s;ips about a Winter's Fire, when the young Auditors crouch clo&s;er and clo&s;er together, and dare not look about for fear of what may be behind them, leave Impre&s;&s;ions that no &s;ub&s;equent Rea&s;on or Religion can efface. The Ideas of an Apparition, on the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions, are connected with all the Horrours, of which infant Imaginations can be &s;u&s;|ceptible; Fangs, Horns, a threatning Mien, &s;aucer Eyes, a flaming Breath, and a deadly A&s;pect. When Children are told of Fairies, who carry off People to dwell with them under Ground, and of evil Spirits who &s;natch away Soul and Body, together, to be their A&s;&s;ociates in Regions of Darkne&s;s, and Woe, the Fear of &s;uch Evils greatly &s;urpa&s;&s;es tho&s;e of Death, as it weds Mi&s;ery to Exi&s;tence beyond the Grave. &mdash; On the contrary Side. Had Spirits been originally repre&s;ented to In|fants as Beings of an amiable Appearance, and as Guardians benevolent and beneficent to Man; had they further deigned to vi&s;it us under &s;uch Repre&s;entations, and, had we experienced the Advantage of their In|&s;tructions

We have not the fif|tieth Story either propagated or believed, that was credited as Go&s;pel when I was a Boy. What think you, is it for, or again&s;t Religion, that &s;uch Fables &s;hould get foot|ing among Mankind?</P>

<P>I never could think it for the In|tere&s;t of Religion that the Providence of God &s;hould be elbowed, as it were, quite out of the World by a Sy&s;tem of Daemo|ni&s;m. On the other Hand, I take the Devil to be a Per&s;onage of much more Prudence than to frighten his Favourites from him by a&s;&s;uming &s;uch horrid and di&s;|gu&s;tful Appearances. He rather chu&s;es to lurk behind Temptation, in the Allure|ment of Beauty, the Deceitfulne&s;s of Smiles, the Glozing of Compliments, in Revel and Banquetting, in Titles and Honours, in the Glitter of Ornament, and in the Pomp of State. When God &s;ends his Spirits on Me&s;&s;ages to Man, there is a Meaning of Importance in the Errand. Such was that of his Angel to <HI>Manoah</HI> for the Delivery of a People; and to <HI>Zacharias</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="80">and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin for the Redemption of Humankind. But, when the Devil is &s;aid to &s;end his Emi&s;&s;aries throughout the Earth, on what Errands does this Arch-Politician employ them? Even &s;uch as could &s;uit no other than a Dunce or a Driveller. I never yet heard of one of the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ions that could be con&s;trued to any Intention of Cunning or common Sen&s;e. I therefore hold the Legends of his gho&s;tly Vi&s;itation to be altogether apocryphal.</P>

<P>Every Man of common Sen&s;e mu&s;t be of the &s;ame Opinion. And yet, have you known any Per&s;on wholely free from &s;uch Prejudices, who made no Di&s;tinction, on this fanta&s;tical Article, between Dark|ne&s;s and Mid-Day, between a lonely Char|nel Hou&s;e and a full A&s;&s;embly?</P>

<P>I have; but they were Men of ex|ceeding &s;trong Nerves; as al&s;o of exceed|ingly clear or exceedingly callous Con&s;cien|ces, which, coming from oppo&s;ite Points, equally met for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Two Travellers, the One a Man of Pie|ty, the Other a Profligate, met at a Coun|try Inn ju&s;t as Night came upom them. It was <HI>Halontide-Eve,</HI> the Sea&s;on, in tho&s;e Days, wherein the Devils were &s;aid to keep high Carnival, and when all the Inhabitants
<PB N="81" REF="81">of the vi&s;ionary Regions were &s;uppo&s;ed to revel and range throughout the Earth at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>For want of better Company our Tra|vellers made up an Acquaintance, and further cemented it by a Jugg of good Li|quor. The Night was dark. The Girls of the Hou&s;e had new wa&s;h'd their Smocks, to be hung to the Fire, and turn'd by the gho&s;tly Re&s;emblances of their Sweethearts; and the Conver&s;ation, in the Kitchen, ran on many an authentic Narrative of Spectres, and, particularly, on the Man in Gibbets who hung by the Road, and who was re|ported, between Twelve and One at Mid|night, to de&s;cend from the Gallows, and take ju&s;t three turns about the old Barn.</P>
<P>Do you believe any of this droll Stuff, &s;aid the Profligate. I know not what to think, an&s;wered his pious Companion, I find all the World in the &s;ame Story, and yet, as the &s;aying is, I never &s;aw any Thing more frightful than my&s;elf. As for my Share, &s;aid the Profligate, I think I &s;houldn't fear the great Devil him&s;elf; and indeed I &s;hould be glad to have a little Chat with the old Gentleman. Stout as you are, rejoined his Companion, I will lay you a Bett of five Crowns that you dare not warm a Porringer of Broth, and
<PB N="82" REF="82">go, and offer it, without there, to the Man in Gibbets, I will depend on your Honour for Performance of Articles. 'Tis done, cried the other; the Betts were produced, and re&s;pectively depo&s;ited in the Hands of my Landlady.</P>
<P>Our pious Traveller, who now began to be alarmed for his Wager, &s;tole &s;lily out, while his Companion was bu&s;ied in heating the Broth. He made up to the Place where the decea&s;ed Malefactor was taking the fre&s;h Air. The Gallows was low, and, by the Advantage of a Bank behind and his own Agility, he leaped up and fa&s;tened his Arms about the Shoulders of the Corp&s;e, &s;o that they both appeared but as one Body.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t fixed him&s;elf to his Mind, when, up comes his Companion with the Porringer and a Stool. He directly mount|ed the Stool, and, reaching up a &s;poonful of Broth to the Mouth of the Dead, with a firm and bold Voice he cried, Sup Man! why don't you Sup?</P>
<P>Scarce had the&s;e Words been uttered, when, fearful to hear! with a Tone deep as Hell and di&s;mal as the Grave, the Man in Gibbets replied&mdash;It i&mdash;is too ho&mdash;ot. And damn you, why don't you blow it then? rejoined the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>RUFFLED Linen, laced Hat, Silk Stockings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had now been order|ed, for <HI>Harry,</HI> with a new Suit of Cloaths, trim'd like tho&s;e of your Beau-In&s;ects, vul|garly called Butterflies. They were tried on, in the Pre&s;ence of his Parents, and highly approved by all, except <HI>Harry</HI> him|&s;elf, who &s;eemed, by his Fidgettings, to be &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ted at this new Kind of Incumbrance. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, puts me in mind of the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> in the Ar|mour of <HI>Saul,</HI> he has not yet proved them. Well <HI>Harry,</HI> how do you like your&s;elf? I don't know, not I, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> But, Papa, can you tell me what the&s;e Things are for? In truth <HI>Harry,</HI> you po&s;e me. Won't People love me better, Sir? not a whit indeed <HI>Harry,</HI> replied my Lord. L&mdash;d help that little Fool's Head of thine, interpo&s;ed my Lady, if People won't love thee, they'll re&s;pect thee the more. Fool's Head! repeated my Lord, upon my Soul, the Child has more Sen&s;e than Half our Nobility.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> had been, now, near a Month with his Parents, and, as his Nur&s;e had not yet parted, he was tolerably amenable to Quality Government. However, he
<PB N="85" REF="85">pined in the Ab&s;ence of his Dada, as he called him, and daily importuned my Lord and Lady to be permitted to go and &s;ee him. For, as <HI>Harry</HI>'s Heart told him that his bearded Dada loved him better than all the World, &s;o <HI>Harry</HI> loved him better than three Worlds; for, he was ever de&s;irous of going three Times as far, in Affection and good Offices, as any one went for him.</P>
<P>At length, he obtained Con&s;ent, and was conducted, by his Nur&s;e, in all his Finery, on a Vi&s;it to this dear Dada.</P>
<P>Their meeting was accompanied by Tears of Joy on both Sides; when the old Gentleman, &s;truck with Concern at the Garb in which he &s;aw his Darling, cried out, and who, my Dear, put this Fool's Coat upon my Child? Fool's Coat, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry;</HI> yes, my Love, it is wor&s;e than all that; they were very naughty Doctors who have endeavoured to poi&s;on my Boy. There is not a Bit, of all this Lace and Ruffling, that is not full of rank Poi&s;ons. I will tell you a Story my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>There was, once upon a Time, a very good and a very clever Boy called <HI>Hercules.</HI> As he grew up, be&s;ide his Prayers and his Book, he was taught to run, and leap; to ride, wre&s;tle, and cudgel; and tho' he was able to beat all
<PB N="86" REF="86">the Boys in the Pari&s;h, he never u&s;ed to hurt or quarrel with any of them. He did not matter Cold, nor Hunger, nor what he eat, nor what he drank; nor how, nor where he lay; and he went always dre&s;&s;ed in the Skin of a wild Bea&s;t, that could bear all Winds and Weathers, and that he could put on or off at Plea&s;ure, for he knew that his Dre&s;s was no Part of him&s;elf, and could neither add to him, nor take away any Thing from him.</P>
<P>When this brave Boy came to Man's E&s;tate, he went about the World, doing Good in all Places; helping the Weak, and feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked, and comforting tho&s;e that cried, and beating all tho&s;e that did Hurt or Wrong to others; and all good People loved him with their whole Hearts, and all naughty People feared him terribly.</P>
<P>But, O &s;ad and di&s;mal! a Lady, whom he had &s;aved from great Hurt and Shame, made him a Pre&s;ent of a new Coat, which was called a Shirt, in tho&s;e Days, as they wore it next the Skin. And now, my <HI>Harry,</HI> take Notice. The Lady had co|vered this Coat, all over, with Laces, and with Rufflings, and with Beads of Gla&s;s, and &s;uch other Fooleries; &s;o that poor <HI>Hercules,</HI> looked ju&s;t as fine, as you do now. And he turned him to this Side,
<PB N="87" REF="87">and he turned him to that Side, and he began to think more and better of him&s;elf, becau&s;e he had got this Fool's Coat upon him. And the Poi&s;on of it entered into his Body and into his Mind, and brought Weakne&s;s and Di&s;tempers upon the one and the other. And he grew &s;o fond of it that he could not bear to have it put off. For he thought that, to part with it, would be to part with his Fle&s;h from his Bones. Neither would he venture out in the Rain, any more; nor box nor wre&s;tle with any Body, for fear of &s;poiling his fine Coat. So that in Time, he lo&s;t the Love and the Prai&s;es of every Body; and all People &s;corned him, and pointed at him for a Fool and a Coxcomb, as he went by.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Time, after the old Gentle|man had fini&s;hed his Story, the Child con|tinued to gaze up at him, with fixed Eyes and open Mouth, as fearful of lo&s;ing any Syllable that he might utter. 'Till, recollecting him&s;elf, he cried out, O, this is a very &s;ad Ca&s;e, indeed; I wi&s;h my Coat was burnt, &s;o I do, but, don't fear for me Dada. Why, how then <HI>Harry?</HI> replied his Patron. Why, I may find a Trick for all this, Dada, I warrant, you never &s;ee me in this ugly Coat again.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="88">
After this and &s;ome other In&s;tructions and mutual Endearments, Nur&s;e pre&s;s'd to be gone; and the&s;e two fond Friends were compelled to &s;under, with a Promi&s;e, on <HI>Harry</HI>'s Part, of a &s;peedy Return.</P>
<P>For &s;ome Time after his Arrival at the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, <HI>Harry</HI> appeared thought|ful, and greatly dejected, which they a&s;|cribed to his parting with his old Friend; but <HI>Harry</HI> had Schemes in his Head that they were little able to fathom or gue&s;s at. Having peeped about, for &s;ome Time, he found a Knife, in a Window, which he in&s;tantly &s;eized upon, and then, &s;tole up with all po&s;&s;ible Privacy, to his Apart|ment.</P>
<P>There he &s;tript him&s;elf, in a Hurry, and, falling as quickly to work, began to cut and rip and rend away the Lacings of his Suit, without &s;paring Cloth or Seam. While he was, thus, in the Heat and very Middle of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, he heard him&s;elf, repeatedly called on the Stairs, and hurry|ing on his Cloaths, to obey the Summons, he ran down to the Parlour with Half the Trimmings hanging in Geometry, Frit|ters, and Tatters about him.</P>
<P>The droll, and very extraordinary Fi|gure that he cut, &s;truck all the Company
<PB N="89" REF="89">into utter Amazement. Having gazed on him, for &s;ome Time, in a kind of &s;ilent Stupor. Why <HI>Harry,</HI> cries my Lady, what's all this for? who abu&s;ed you, my Child, who put you in this Pickle? come hither and tell me, who &s;poiled your Cloaths? I did, Madam. You did, Sirrah, cried my Lady, giving him a Shake, and how dare you &s;poil them? why, becau&s;e they wanted to &s;poil me, &s;aid <HI>Harry.</HI> And who told you they would &s;poil you, Sir|rah? I won't tell, &s;aid <HI>Harry.</HI> I'll lay a Wager, cried my Lady, it was that old Rogue with the Beard; but I'll have him whipt for a Fool and a Knave out of the Pari&s;h. Pray, my Dear, be patient a little, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip. Come here, <HI>Harry,</HI> and tell me the Truth, &s;toutly; and no Harm &s;hall happen to you or your Dada with the Beard. Come, &s;peak, what Fault did he find with your Cloaths? Why, Sir, he &s;aid, as how they would poi&s;on me. Poi&s;on you, my Dear; pray how was that? Why, Sir, he told me as how there was a little Ma&s;ter, call'd <HI>Herclus,</HI> and as how he was a mighty good Boy, and was cold and hungry, and almo&s;t naked, and did not matter, &s;o as how he could do Good to every Body; and as how every Body loved him with all their Heart. And then, he told me, as how he got a mighty fine Coat, and looked here, and looked there,
<PB N="90" REF="90">and minded nothing but his Coat; and as how his Coat poi&s;on'd him, and would not let him do any more Good, and as how all the Boys then hated him, and pi&s;s'd upon him, Sir &mdash; and as how &mdash; I believe, that's all, Sir &mdash;</P>
<P>Here, my Lord and Lady took &s;uch a Chink of Laughing, that it was &s;ome Time before they could recover; while <HI>Harry</HI> looked aba&s;hed and di&s;concerted. But my Lord, recollecting him&s;elf, took the Child on his Knee, and, warmly pre&s;&s;ing him to his Bo&s;om, I mu&s;t tell you, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid he, as how you are a mighty good Boy, and as how your Dada with a Beard is a mighty good Dada, and has told you all that is right and true. And, that I will go, my&s;elf, one of the&s;e Days, and thank him in Per&s;on. Thank you, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid my Lord, I promi&s;e that no one &s;hall poi&s;on you any more, with my Con&s;ent. Whereupon another new Suit was immediately appointed, of a Kind that &s;hould fear no Weather, nor, in ca&s;e of Dirt or Damage, draw upon <HI>Harry</HI> the Re&s;entment or Admonitions of his Mama.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Dinner was &s;erved up, Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> entered and took his Seat. He
<PB N="91" REF="91">came in order to conciliate a late Difference between the Earl and Sir <HI>Standi&s;h Stately;</HI> and in this he found no manner of Diffi|culty, as my Lord was, by Nature, of a kindly Di&s;po&s;ition, and required no more than a fir&s;t Advance to be reconciled to any Man.</P>
<P>During the Entertainment, <HI>Harry</HI> kept his Eyes fixed on Mr. <HI>Meekly;</HI> and, as &s;oon as the Cloth was off, he ro&s;e, went over to him, looked fondly in his Face, and took hold of his Hand with the Familiarity of an old Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid my Lord, my Son <HI>Harry</HI> pays you a very particular and very de&s;erved Compliment; he puts me in mind of that Sort of In&s;tinct, by which a &s;trange Dog is always &s;ure to di&s;cover, and to ap|ply to the mo&s;t benevolent Per&s;on at Ta|ble. Indeed, my Lord, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> (care&s;&s;ing the Child) I know not, whether by In&s;tinct, or by what other name to call my own Feelings; but certain it is that, the fir&s;t Moment I &s;aw him, in his little pea&s;ant Petticoats, I found my Heart &s;trongly affected toward him.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort Time my Lady retired, with the Children, and left the Earl and Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI> over a temperate Bottle. Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid my Lord, (taking him cor|dially
<PB N="92" REF="92">by the Hand) I rejoice at the Advan|tage of our late Acquaintance, or rather I repine that it was not earlier. I am great|ly intere&s;ted, Sir, in a&s;king you a few Que&s;tions, if I thought I might do it with|out Offence. Are you any way &s;traitened in your Circum&s;tances? &mdash; No, my Lord, &mdash; But, would you not wi&s;h them more affluent, would you not wi&s;h that your Power of doing Good were more exten&s;ive, more an&s;werable to the Benevolence of your own Inclinations? &mdash; I cannot &s;ay that I would, my Lord. I have upward of &s;even Hundred a Year clear Income; and that is fourteen Times more than I have Occa&s;ion to expend. &mdash; It would be indelicate, re|plied the Earl, very indelicate to own that I am &s;orry for your Pro&s;perity; and yet I feel that I &s;hould have been happy in your Di&s;tre&s;s, in the Power it would have given me to &s;erve, to oblige you. I want a Friend, I want ju&s;t &s;uch a Friend as Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> and I know of no Price at which I would not gladly purcha&s;e him. &mdash; My Lord, I am yours, freely, affectionately yours, with|out Fee or Condition. Sir, rejoined my Lord, as I find that I cannot make out a Title to your particular Attachment, I am content to be taken into the general Circle of your Benevolence.</P>
<P>The World, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> think me the happie&s;t of Men; ble&s;s'd in my Family,
<PB N="93" REF="93">in my Friends; with Health, Honours, Affluence; with the Power of gratifying every Wi&s;h that human Fancy can form! but alas! my Sen&s;ations are very far from affirming their Judgment of the&s;e Matters; and I will de&s;erve your Advice, your Con|&s;olation, if you can afford it, by unbo&s;om|ing my&s;elf to you without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>When I reflect on my pa&s;t Life, I look on many Parts of it with Repentance, and on the Whole with Regret. Not that I wi&s;h the return of Plea&s;ures that I now de|&s;pi&s;e, or of Years &s;pent in a Manner that Virtue and common Sen&s;e mu&s;t equally di&s;approve? but I am arrived at my Even|ing of Life, like a Sport&s;man who, having been in pur&s;uit of Game all the Day, re|turns homeward, &s;orrowful, &s;atigued, and di&s;appointed. With every Advantage that could gratify either my Vanity or my Ap|petites, I cannot affirm that I ever ta&s;ted of true Enjoyment; and I now well per|ceive that I was kept from being mi&s;erable, merely by Amu&s;ement and Di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>As I had the Misfortune to be born to Title and a va&s;t E&s;tate, all People re&s;pect|ed, in me, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Objects which they them&s;elves were in pur&s;uit of. I was con&s;equently be&s;et with Sycophants and Deceivers of all Sorts, and thereby, trained from my Infancy, to unavoidable
<PB N="94" REF="94">Prejudices, Errors, and fal&s;e E&s;timates of every Thing. I was not naturally ill-di&s;|po&s;ed, but I was perpetually &s;educed from all my better Tendencies.</P>
<P>Both my Parents died, before I arrived at tho&s;e Years wherein our Laws allow of any Title to Di&s;cretion. I had but the one Brother, O that dear Brother, how many Sighs he has co&s;t me! I was older than him by about &s;even Years, and this di&s;|parity of our Age, together with the ele|vating Notion of my Birthright, gave me the authoritative Airs of a Father, without a Father's Tenderne&s;s toward him. This mutually prevented that Cordiality, that Sympathy, as I may &s;ay, by which Bro|thers &s;hould be cemented during their Mi|nority. And, when our Guardian, as I then judged, had &s;o far betrayed his Tru&s;t, as to bind my Brother apprentice to a Trader, and thereby to deprive him of all Title to Gentility. I looked upon him as a Branch cut off from the Family-Tree, and, as my Thoughts about him were accom|panied by Coldne&s;s or Di&s;gu&s;t, I forbore to make any Enquiry concerning him.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, however, that he was not equally unnatural on his Part; but, hearing of the di&s;&s;olute Life I led on my return from Travel, he might ju&s;tly deem
<PB N="95" REF="95">me unworthy of his Acquaintance or No|tice.</P>
<P>During the Time of my Intimacy with his late Maje&s;ty and the Mini&s;ters of his Plea&s;ures and Policy, a Servant brought me Word that a Gentleman, attended by a Number of the principal Citizens, waited for me in my Ante-chamber; whereupon I gave Orders for their immediate Intro|duction.</P>
<P>On their Entrance, I was awfully &s;truck with the Pre&s;ence of their Principal, with the Elegance of his Figure, the Noble|ne&s;s of his A&s;pect, and Ea&s;e of his Ad|dre&s;s, and I felt my&s;elf drawn to him by a &s;udden Kind of in&s;tinctive Attachment.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays he, we come to wait upon you in the Name of the very re&s;pect|able Body of the Citizens of <HI>London;</HI> &s;ome Infringements have been lately made on their City-Charter, and their fir&s;t Applica|tion is to your Lord&s;hip, as they wi&s;h, above all others, to be obliged to you for their Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>They have been very di&s;creet, &s;aid I, in their choice of an Advocate. Their De|mands mu&s;t be exorbitant, if they fail of Succe&s;s while you are their Solicitor.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="96">
This Paper, proceeded he, contains a clear Detail of their Rights and the En|croachments that have been made there|on. They are &s;en&s;ible of your Lord&s;hip's Intere&s;t with his Maje&s;ty and the Mini&s;|try, and they humbly petition for your Fa|vour and happy Influence in their Behalf.</P>
<P>Without Papers, I replied, or any In|ducement &s;ave that of your own Reque&s;t, let me but know what I am to do, and I &s;hall think my&s;elf truely honoured and obliged by your Commands.</P>
<P>My Lord, he rejoined, I do not wi&s;h to betray you into any mi&s;taken or unmerited Complai&s;ance. I am but a Trader, a Citi|zen of the lower Order.</P>
<P>I now felt my&s;elf blu&s;h with Shame and Di&s;appointment; I re&s;ented my being de|ceived by the Dignity of his Appearance; and I was more particularly piqued by the &s;arca&s;tical kind of Smile with which he clo&s;ed his Declaration. All confu&s;ed, I looked down, and pretended to ca&s;t my Eye over the Paper, in order to gain Time for Recollection. Having, at Intervals, muttered a few Words, &s;uch as Charters, Grants, Privileges, Immunities, and &s;o forth. I am not, &s;aid I, an Enemy to the lower Ranks of Men; poor People mu&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="97">live, and their Service, as well as Subor|dination is nece&s;&s;ary to Society; but I con|fe&s;s I was always fond of tho&s;e &s;umptuary Laws that confined the Degrees of Men to their re&s;pective Departments, and pre|vented Mechanics from confounding them|&s;elves with Gentlemen.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays he, with the mo&s;t ea&s;y and provoking Unconcern, when you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to look down from the Superi|ority of your Station, and to con&s;ider Things and Per&s;ons according to their Me|rits, you will not de&s;pi&s;e Some, merely for being of u&s;e to Others. The Wealth, Pro&s;perity, and Importance of all this World is founded and erected on three living Pillars, the TILLER of the Ground, the MANUFACTURER and the MERCHANT. Of the&s;e, the Tiller is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the lea&s;t re&s;pectable, as he requires the lea&s;t of Genius, Invention, or Addre&s;s; and yet the Plowman <HI>Tripto|lemus</HI> was wor&s;hipped as a God; and the Plowman <HI>Cincinnatus</HI> is &s;till held in as high E&s;teem as any Peer of any Realm, &s;ave that of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>I have known, &s;aid I, a Mob of &s;uch Gods and Dictators &s;omewhat dangerous at Times. I mu&s;t be free to tell you, Mi&s;|ter, that Matters are much changed &s;ince Prince&s;&s;es kept Sheep, and the Sons of
<PB N="98" REF="98">Kings were Cow-herds. The Ranks and Orders of Men are now appointed and known, and one Department mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to break in upon the other. My Baker, Barber, Brewer, Butcher, Hatter, Ho&s;ier, and Taylor, are, unque&s;tionably, of U&s;e, though I have not the Honour of being acquainted with one of them. And, hitherto, I have deemed it &s;ufficient to &s;end my Servants to entertain and pay them their Bills, without admitting them to a Tete a Tete, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>He now rejoined, with a little Warmth. My Lord, we pardon your Indelicacy, in con&s;ideration of your Error. The venera|ble Body, now pre&s;ent, might be admitted to a Tete a Tete with the fir&s;t E&s;tate of this Kingdom, without any Conde&s;cen&s;ion on the Part of Maje&s;ty. And, would you allow your&s;elf to be duely informed, I &s;hould &s;oon make you &s;en&s;ible that we have actually done you the Honour which we intended by this Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Permit me to repeat that the Wealth, Pro&s;perity, and Importance of every Thing upon Earth ari&s;es from the TILLER, the MANUFACTURER and the MERCHANT; and that, as nothing is truely e&s;timable, &s;ave in Proportion to its utility, the&s;e are, con&s;equently, very
<PB N="99" REF="99">far from being contemptible Characters. The Tiller &s;upplies the Manufacturer, the Manufacturer &s;upplies the Merchant, and the Merchant &s;upplies the World with all its Wealth. It is thus that Indu&s;try is promoted, Arts invented and improved, Commerce extended, Superfluities mutually vended, Wants mutually &s;upplied, that each Man becomes a u&s;eful Member of Society, that Societies become further of Advantage to each other, and that States are enabled to pay and dignify their upper Servants with Titles, rich Revenues, Prin|cipalities and Crowns.</P>
<P>The Merchant, above all, is exten&s;ive, con&s;iderable, and re&s;pectable by his Occu|pation. It is he who furni&s;hes every Com|fort, Convenience, and Elegance of Life; who carries off every Redundance, who fills up every Want; who ties Country to Country, and Clime to Clime, and brings the remote&s;t Regions to Neighbourhood and Conver&s;e; who makes Man to be li|terally the Lord of the Creation, and gives him an Intere&s;t in whatever is done upon Earth; who furni&s;hes to each the Product of all Lands, and the Labours of all Nati|ons; and thus knits into one Family and weaves into one Web the Affinity and Brotherhood of all Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="100">
I have no Quarrel, I cried, to the high and mighty my Lords the Merchants, if each could be humbly content with the Profits of his Profe&s;&s;ion, without forming them&s;elves into Companies, exclu&s;ive of their Brethren, our itinerant Merchants and Pedlars. I confe&s;s my&s;elf an Enemy to the Monopolies of your charter'd Com|panies and City Corporations; and I can perceive no evil Con&s;equence, to the Pub|lic or the State, if all &s;uch A&s;&s;ociations were this In&s;tant di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Permit me, he mildly replied, once for all, to &s;et your Lord&s;hip right in this Mat|ter. I am &s;en&s;ible that the Gentlemen of large landed Properties are apt to look up|on them&s;elves as the Pillars of the State, and to con&s;ider their Intere&s;ts and the In|tere&s;ts of the Nation, as very little behol|den or dependent on Trade; though the Fact is, that tho&s;e very Gentlemen would lo&s;e nine Parts in ten of their yearly Re|turns, and the Nation nine Tenths of her yearly Revenues, if Indu&s;try and the Arts, (promoted as I &s;aid by Commerce) did not rai&s;e the Products of Lands to tenfold their natural Value. The Manufacturer, on the other Hand, depends on the landed Intere&s;t for nothing &s;ave the material of his Craft; and the Merchant is wholely in|dependent of all Lands, or rather he is the
<PB N="101" REF="101">general Patron thereof. I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, to your Lord&s;hip, that this bene|ficent Profe&s;&s;ion is by no means confined to Individuals, as you would have it. Large Societies of Men, nay mighty Nations may and have been Merchants. When Socie|ties incorporate, for &s;uch a worthy Pur|po&s;e, they are formed as a Foetus within the Womb of the Mother, a Con&s;titution within the general State or Con&s;titution; their particular Laws and Regulations ought, always, to be conformable to tho&s;e of the National Sy&s;tem; and, in that Ca&s;e, &s;uch Corporations greatly conduce to the Peace and good Order of Cities and large Towns, and to the general Power and Pro&s;perity of the Nation.</P>
<P>A Nation that is a Merchant has no need of an Extent of Lands, as it can de|rive to it&s;elf Sub&s;i&s;tance from all Parts of the Globe. <HI>Tyre</HI> was &s;ituated in a &s;mall I&s;land on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Phaenicia,</HI> and yet that &s;ingle City contained the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing, opulent, and powerful Nation in the Univer&s;e; a Nation that long with|&s;tood the united Forces of the three fir&s;t Monarchies, brought again&s;t her by <HI>Nebu|chadnezar</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great.</P>
<P>The &s;even united Provinces do not con|tain Lands &s;ufficient for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of one Third of their Inhabitants; but they
<PB N="102" REF="102">are a Nation of Merchants; the World furni&s;hes them with an Abundance of all good Things; by Commerce they have arrived at Empire; they have a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the Principality of the Ocean; and, by being Lords of the Ocean, are in a Mea&s;ure become the Proprietors of all Lands.</P>
<P>Should <HI>England</HI> ever open her Eyes to her own Intere&s;ts, &s;he will follow the &s;ame pro&s;perous and ennobling Profe&s;&s;ion; &s;he will conform to the Con&s;equences of her Si|tuation. She will &s;ee that, without a Naval Pre-eminence, &s;he cannot be &s;afe; and, without Trade, that her Naval Power cannot be &s;upported. Her Glory will al&s;o flow from this &s;ure Source of her Intere&s;ts, and a Sail-yard will become the highe&s;t Scepter of her Dignity. She will then find that a &s;ingle Triumph of her Flag will be more available, for her Pro&s;perity, than the Conque&s;t of the four Continents; that her Pre-eminence, by Sea, will carry and diffu&s;e her Influence over all Lands; and, that univer&s;al Influence is univer&s;al Dominion.</P>
<P>Avarice, my Lord, may pile; Robbery may plunder; new Mines may be opened; hidden Trea&s;ures may be di&s;covered; Game&s;ters may win Ca&s;h; Conquerors
<PB N="103" REF="103">may win Kingdoms; but all &s;uch Means of acquiring Riches are tran&s;ient and de|terminable. While Indu&s;try and Com|merce are the natural, the living, the ne|ver failing Fountains, from whence the Wealth of this World can alone be taught to flow.</P>
<P>And can you, cried I, have the Effronte|ry, to in&s;inuate a Preference, of your&s;elf and your fellow Cits, to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> No|bles and Princes, who derive their Powers and Dignities from the &s;tedfa&s;t Extent of their landed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Was it by Barter and Bargain that our <HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henrys</HI> atchiev'd their Conque&s;ts on the Conti|nent? or was it by Pedlars and Mechanics, think you, that the Fields of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i,</HI> of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> and <HI>Agincourt</HI> are render'd im|mortal? Go, I continued, &s;eek el&s;ewhere for Redre&s;s of your in&s;ignificant Grievances; we give little to &s;turdy Beggars, but no|thing to &s;aucy Rivals.</P>
<P>Wholely kindled by this Invective, he ca&s;t on me a fierce and menacing Re|gard; and, with a &s;evere Accent, and a &s;ide Glance that &s;hot Fire; when Courti|ers (&s;ays he) acquire Common-Sen&s;e, and that Lords &s;hall have learn'd to behave them&s;elves like Gentlemen, I may do &s;uch a one the Honour to acknowledge him for a Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="104">
Your Brother! exclaimed Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> your Brother, my Lord?&mdash;Yes, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> my Brother, my amiable, my ve|ry amiable and honourable Brother, in|deed. But, turning contemptuou&s;ly from me, he in&s;tantly departed with his attend|ing Citizens.</P>
<P>I ought to have followed, I ought to have &s;taid him. I &s;hould have fallen up|on his Neck. With my Tears and Car|re&s;&s;es I &s;hould have wrung a Pardon from him, and not have &s;uffer'd him to leave me till by my Submi&s;&s;ons I had obtained full Forgivene&s;s. This, indeed, was my fir&s;t Emotion. But the Recollection of my long and unnatural Neglect, my utter Di&s;|regard of his Per&s;on and Concerns, now aggravated by my late In&s;ults, per&s;uaded me that a Reconciliation, on his Part, was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I remained di&s;concerted, and greatly di&s;turbed I felt with what Pride and Tran&s;port I &s;hould now have acknowledg|ed, have courted, have cla&s;ped this Bro|ther to my Bo&s;om; but my Fancy repre|&s;ented him as Ice in my Arms, as &s;hrink|ing and turning from me with Di&s;gu&s;t and Di&s;dain. At Times, I formed a hundred Schemes toward recovering his Affections; but again, rejecting the&s;e as ineffectual,
<PB N="105" REF="105">I endeavoured to con&s;ole my&s;elf for his Lo&s;s, by con&s;idering his late Demeanour as exceeding faulty, and expre&s;&s;ive of a Di&s;|po&s;ition in&s;ufferably proud and overbear|ing. My Heart, indeed, acknowledged how very lovely he was in his Per&s;on; but the Superiority of his Talents, and the Re|finement of his Manners, gave him a Di&s;|tinction that was not altogether &s;o grateful.</P>
<P>All Day I kept my Apartment, in Di&s;|plea&s;ure, at my Brother, my&s;elf, and the World. The next Morning I was in|formed that, the Moment he left me, he went to the Mini&s;ter, who engaged, at his In&s;tance, to have every Grievance that he complained of redre&s;&s;ed to their extent. That the Mini&s;ter had, afterwards, intro|duced him to his Maje&s;ty in full Levee, that the King held him in long and fami|liar Conver&s;ation, and that all the Court was profu&s;e of their Admiration and Prai&s;es of Mr. <HI>Clinton.</HI></P>
<P>This, al&s;o, was fre&s;h Matter of Tri|umph to him, and Mortification to me. It was now evident that my Brother's Ap|plication to me was intended, merely, to do me peculiar Honour; and, in Return, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, I have endeavoured to cover him with Confu&s;ion and Di&s;grace. Yet, when I under&s;tood that he had di&s;|dained to mention me as his Brother, or
<PB N="106" REF="106">of his Blood; I al&s;o &s;corned to derive Lu&s;tre from any Claim of Affinity with him; and I further felt that I could not forgive him the Reproaches which he con|&s;trained me to give my&s;elf in his behalf.</P>
<P>From that Time, I took great Pains to di&s;&s;ipate or &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e unea&s;y Sen&s;ati|ons which the Remembrance of him gave me. But, after I had married and retired from the Glare and Bu&s;tle of the World; and, more particularly, on the Birth of my fir&s;t Child, when my Heart had en|tered into a new Sphere of dome&s;tic Feel|ings, this dear Brother returned with double Weight upon my Mind. Yet his Idea was no longer accompanied by Envy or Re&s;entment, but by an affectionate and &s;weet, though paining, Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>I wrote him a Letter full of penitential Submi&s;&s;ions, and of tender and atoning Prayers for Pardon and Reconcilement. But, alas, my Me&s;&s;enger returned with Tidings that, &s;ome Years pa&s;t, he had withdrawn from Trade, had retired to <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> had dropt all Corre&s;|pondence, and that no one in <HI>England</HI> knew whether he was dead or alive.</P>
<P>Ah, my Brother, my dear Brother! (I would often repeat to my&s;elf) has any Re|ver&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="107">of Fortune happened to you, my Brother? Perhaps &s;ome dome&s;tic Calami|ty; &s;ome heavy Di&s;tre&s;s, no doubt! and no Brother at Hand to con&s;ole or &s;hare your Afflictions. Return to me, divide my Heart, divide my Fortune with me and mine! Alas, Wretch that I am, you know not yet that you have a Brother, one de&s;erving of that Name. You know not that this Bo&s;om of Flint is now huma|nized, and melted down in the Fervour of Affection toward you. You hate me, you de&s;pi&s;e me, my amiable Brother! How, how &s;hall I make you &s;en&s;ible that my Heart is full of your Image, of E&s;teem, of tendere&s;t Love for my lovely <HI>Harry Clinton?</HI></P>
<P>I, again, &s;ent other Me&s;&s;engers in &s;earch of Intelligence, I procured Letters to the Bankers and Merchants of principal Note abroad; but all my Solicitudes and Enqui|ries were equally fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>The Grief, that this occa&s;ioned, fir&s;t taught me to reflect, and ca&s;t a Shade over the Lu&s;tre of every Object about me. The World no more appeared as that World which, formerly, had held out Happine&s;s to either Hand. I no longer beheld it thro' the Per&s;pectives of Curio&s;i|ty or youthful De&s;ire; I had worn out all its Gayeties; I had exhau&s;ted all its De|lights,
<PB N="108" REF="108">for me it had nothing more to pro|mi&s;e, or be&s;tow; and yet I &s;aw no better Pro&s;pect, no other Re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Should I turn to Religion, a little Ob|&s;ervation taught me that the Devotees, them&s;elves, were warm in pur&s;uit of Ob|jects, of which I was tired; that they were &s;till &s;ubject to the Pa&s;&s;ions and De&s;ires of the World; and were no way to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from other Men, &s;ave by an un|&s;ociable Re&s;erve, or gloomy Ca&s;t of Coun|tenance.</P>
<P>May I venture to confe&s;s to you, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> that, at Times of my De&s;pon|dence, I dared to call the Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;|dom of Omnipotence into que&s;tion. Take this World, (&s;aid I to my&s;elf) con&s;ider it as it &s;eems to &s;tand, independent of any other, and no one living can a&s;&s;ign a &s;in|gle End, or Purpo&s;e, for which it could be made. Men are even as their Fellow-In&s;ects; they ri&s;e to Life, exert their Lineaments, and flutter abroad during the Summer of their little Sea&s;on; then droop, die away, and are &s;ucceeded, and &s;ucceed|ed in an in&s;ignificant Rotation. Even the firme&s;t human E&s;tabli&s;hments, the be&s;t labour'd Sy&s;tems of Policy, can &s;carce boa&s;t a nobler Fate, or a longer Duration; the mightie&s;t States and Nations peri&s;h, like Individuals; in one Leaf we read their
<PB N="109" REF="109">Hi&s;tory, we admire their Achievements, we are intere&s;ted in their Succe&s;&s;es, but, proceed to the next, and no more than a Name is left; the <HI>Ninevehs</HI> and <HI>Babylons</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are fallen, the <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> are no more; and the Monuments that promi&s;ed to endure to Eternity, are era&s;ed like the Mount of Sand which, Ye&s;terday, the Children ca&s;t up on the Shore.</P>
<P>When I behold this &s;tupendous Expan&s;e, &s;o &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;hed with a Profu&s;ion of Planets, and Luminaries, revolving in appointed Cour&s;es, and diver&s;ifying the Sea&s;ons; I &s;ee a Work that is altogether worthy of a God. Again, when I de&s;cend to Earth, and look abroad upon the infi|nite Productions of Nature, upon Provi&s;i|ons &s;o amply an&s;wering to the Wants of every living Being, and on Objects and Organs &s;o finely fitted to each other, I trace a complicated Maze of Wi&s;dom, Bounty, and Benevolence. But, when I &s;ee all the&s;e Beauties and Benefits counter|acted by &s;ome adver&s;e and de&s;tructive Principle; when the Heavens gather their Clouds and roll their Thunders above, and the Earth begins to quake and open beneath us; when the Air, that &s;eemed &s;o late to be the Breath and Balm of Life, grows pregnant with a Variety of Pe&s;ts, Plagues and Poi&s;ons; when Life it&s;elf is
<PB N="110" REF="110">found to be no other than the Store-hou&s;e or Habitation of Death, and that all vege|table and animal Sy&s;tems include within their Frame, the Principles of inevitable Di&s;temper and Di&s;&s;olution: When additi|onal to all the&s;e natural Mi&s;chiefs, I con|&s;ider the Extent and Empire of moral Evil upon Earth; when I behold the wretched peri&s;hable &s;hort lived Animal, called Man, for the Value of &s;ome Matter of Property as tran&s;ient as him&s;elf, indu&s;|trious and &s;tudious of the De&s;truction of his Species; when, not content with the Evils that Nature has entailed upon him, Man exerts all his Talents for multiplying and &s;peeding the Means of Perdition to Man; when I &s;ee half the World employ|ed in pu&s;hing the other Half from the Verge of Exi&s;tence, and then dropping af|ter in an endle&s;s Succe&s;&s;ion of Malevolence and Mi&s;ery; I cannot po&s;&s;ibly reconcile &s;uch Contra&s;ts and Contradictions to the Agency, or even Permi&s;&s;ion, of the one over ruling Principle of Goodne&s;s called GOD.</P>
<P>Could not Omni&s;cience fore&s;ee &s;uch Con&s;equences, at Creation? Unque&s;tiona|bly, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meekly.</HI></P>
<P>Might he not have ordered Matters &s;o, as to have prevented the Po&s;&s;ibility of any
<PB N="111" REF="111">Degree of natural or moral Evil in his Univer&s;e?&mdash;I think he might, my Lord.&mdash;Why did he not, then, pre|vent them? to what End could he permit &s;uch multiplied Malevolence and Mi&s;ery among his Creatures?&mdash;For Ends, cer|tainly my Lord, infinitely worthy both of his Wi&s;dom and his Goodne&s;s.&mdash;I am de&s;irous it &s;hould be &s;o; but cannot con|ceive, cannot reach the Way or Means of compa&s;&s;ing &s;uch an Intention.</P>
<P>Can you not &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> that Evil may be admitted for accompli&s;h|ing the greater and more abundant Good? May not partial and temporary Malevolence and Mi&s;ery be finally produc|tive of univer&s;al, durable, and unchangea|ble Beatitude? May not the Univer&s;e, even now, be in the Pangs of Travail, of Labour for &s;uch a Birth, &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed Con&s;ummation?</P>
<P>It were, rejoined the Earl, as our <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI> &s;ays, it were indeed a Con&s;ummati|on devoutly to be wi&s;hed. But, might not Omnipotence have brought about a Con&s;ummation equally good, without any Intervention of preceding Evil?&mdash;Had that been po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, it would un|que&s;tionably have been effected. But if certain Relations ari&s;e between God and his Creatures, and between Man and Man
<PB N="112" REF="112">which could not ari&s;e &s;ave on the previous Suppo&s;ition of Evil, without which, in|deed, neither the Attributes of God him|&s;elf, nor the In&s;ufficiency, Dependance, or Obligation of the Creature could have been duely di&s;coverable throughout Eternity, then temporary Evil becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the Con&s;equence and Con|&s;ummation of the greate&s;t Good.</P>
<P>Your Notion, exclaimed the Earl, is great, amazing, truely glorious, and eve|ry Way worthy of a God who, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, would be infinitely worthy of all Wor&s;hip! Is this the Rea&s;on, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> that what we all &s;o earne&s;tly &s;eek for is no where to be found, that no Portion or Ta&s;te of Happine&s;s is to be had upon Earth?</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay &s;o, my Lord; I think that a Man, even on Earth, may be occa&s;ion|ally, nay durably, and exceedingly happy.</P>
<P>What, happy? durably, exceedingly happy? repeated the Earl. I was told that the Experience of Ages, that Philo&s;ophy and even Divinity had agreed with <HI>Solomon</HI> in this, that all upon Earth was Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. If any may enjoy Happine&s;s, on this Side of the great Con|&s;ummation that you &s;peak of, I am per|&s;uaded, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> that you your&s;elf are
<PB N="113" REF="113">the Man. Your Lips indeed &s;ay nothing of the Matter, but neither your Eyes nor your A&s;pect can re&s;train <HI>the Expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome extraordinary Peace that abides within.</HI> O, &s;ay then, my dear, my e&s;timable Friend, whence, how, by what Means may a Man arrive at Happine&s;s?&mdash;By getting out of him&s;elf, my Lord.</P>
<P>Out of him&s;elf, Mr. <HI>Meekly!</HI> you a&s;to|ni&s;h me greatly. A Contradiction in Terms, unnatural, impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;God, him&s;elf, my Lord, cannot make a Man Happy in any other Way, either here, or hereafter.</P>
<P>It is, &s;aid the Earl, an e&s;tabli&s;hed Maxim among all thinking Men, whether Divines or Philo&s;ophers, that SELF-LOVE is the Motive to all human Actions. Virtue forbid! exclaim'd Mr. <HI>Meekly;</HI> all Actions are ju&s;tly held, good or evil, ba&s;e or ho|nourable, dete&s;table or amiable, merely according to their Motives. But, if the Motive is the &s;ame to all, there is an End, at once, to the Po&s;&s;ibility of Virtue; the Cruel and the Kind, the Faithful and the Perfidious, the Pro&s;titute and the Patriot are confounded together.</P>
<P>Do not all Men, return'd the Earl, act agreeable to their own Propen&s;ities and Inclinations? do they not Act &s;o or &s;o,
<PB N="114" REF="114">merely becau&s;e it plea&s;es them &s;o to act? and is not this Plea&s;ure the &s;ame Motive in all?&mdash;By no Means, my Lord, it never was nor can be the Motive in any. We mu&s;t go a Que&s;tion deeper, to di&s;co|ver the &s;ecret Principle or Spring of Acti|on. One Man is plea&s;ed to do Good, ano|ther is plea&s;ed to do Evil; now, whence is it that each is plea&s;ed with Purpo&s;es in their Nature &s;o oppo&s;ite and irreconcila|ble? Becau&s;e, my Lord, that the Propen|&s;ities or Motives to Action, in each, are as oppo&s;ite and irreconcilable as the Acti|ons them&s;elves; the one is prompted and therefore plea&s;ed with his Purpo&s;e of doing Evil to others, through &s;ome ba&s;e Pro&s;pect of Intere&s;t redounding to him&s;elf; the other is prompted and &s;purred, and there|fore plea&s;ed with his Purpo&s;e of endan|gering his Per&s;on or &s;uffering in his For|tune, through the benevolent Pro&s;pect of the Good that &s;hall thereby redound to Others.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure is, it&s;elf, an Effect, and cannot be the Cau&s;e, or Pinciple, or Motive to any Thing; it is an agreeable Sen&s;ation that ari&s;es, in any Animal, on its meeting or contemplating an Object that is &s;uited to its Nature. As far as the Nature of &s;uch an Animal is evil, evil Objects can alone affect it with Plea&s;ure; as far as the Nature of &s;uch an Animal is good, the
<PB N="115" REF="115">Objects mu&s;t be good whereby its Plea&s;ures are excited.</P>
<P>When <HI>Damon</HI> was &s;entenced, by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> to die on &s;uch a Day; he pray'd Permi&s;&s;ion, in the Interim, to re|tire to his own Country, to &s;et the Affairs of his di&s;con&s;olate Family in order. This the Tyrant intended mo&s;t peremptorily to refu&s;e, by granting it, as he conceived, on the impo&s;&s;ible Conditions of his procuring &s;ome one to remain, as Ho&s;tage for his Return, under equal Forfeiture of Life. <HI>Pythias</HI> heard the Conditions, and did not wait for an Application on the Part of <HI>Damon,</HI> he in&s;tantly offer'd him&s;elf to Du|rance in the Place of his Friend, and <HI>Da|mon</HI> was accordingly &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P>The King and all his Courtiers were a&s;|toni&s;hed at this Action, as they could not account for it on any allowed Principles. Self-Intere&s;t, in their Judgment, was the &s;ole Mover of human Affairs; and they looked on Virtue, Friend&s;hip, Benevo|lence, Love of Country, and the like, as Terms invented by the Wi&s;e to impo&s;e upon the Weak. They, therefore, im|puted this Act of <HI>Pythias</HI> to the Extrava|gance of his Folly, to the Defect of Head, merely, and no way to any Virtue or good Quality of Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="116">
When the Day of the de&s;tined Executi|on drew near, the Tyrant had the Curio|&s;ity to vi&s;it <HI>Pythias</HI> in his Dungeon.

He cannot fail therein, my Lord. I am as confident of his Virtue as I am of my own Exi&s;tence. But, I pray, I be&s;eech the Gods to pre&s;erve the Life and Integrity of my <HI>Damon</HI> together. Oppo&s;e him, ye Winds! prevent the Ea|gerne&s;s and Impatience of his honourable Endeavours! and &s;uffer him not to arrive till, by my Death, I have redeemed a Life, a thou&s;and Times of more Con&s;e|quence, more E&s;timation, than my own, more e&s;timable to his lovely Wife, to his precious little Innocents, to his Friends, to his Country.

<P>The fatal Day arrived. <HI>Pythias</HI> was brought forth, and walked, amid&s;t the Guard, with a &s;erious but &s;atisfied Air, to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> was already there. He was exalted on a moving Throne that was drawn by &s;ix white Hor&s;es, and &s;at pen|&s;ive and attentive to the Demeanour of the Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Pythias</HI> came. He vaulted lighty on the Scaffold; and, beholding for &s;ome Time the Apparatus of his Death, he turned with a plea&s;ed Countenance and addre&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>My Prayers are hear'd, he cried, the Gods are propitious! You know, my Friends, that the Winds have been con|trary till Ye&s;terday. <HI>Damon</HI> could not come, he could not conquer Impo&s;&s;ibili|ties; he will be here To-morrow, and the Blood which is &s;hed to Day &s;hall have ran&s;omed the Life of my Friend. O, could I era&s;e, from your Bo&s;oms, every Doubt, every mean Su&s;picion of the Ho|nour
<PB N="118" REF="118">of the Man, for whom I am about to &s;uffer; I &s;hould go to my Death, even as I would to my Bridal. Be it &s;ufficient, in the mean Time, that my Friend will be found noble, that his Truth is unim|peachable, that he will &s;peedily approve it, that he is now on his Way, hurrying on, accu&s;ing him&s;elf, the adver&s;e Elements, and the Gods. But I ha&s;te to prevent his Speed; Executioner, to your Office!</P>
<P>As he pronounced the la&s;t Words, a Buzz began to ari&s;e among the remote&s;t of the People. A di&s;tant Voice was heard. The Croud caught the Words; and, &s;top, &s;top the Execution! was repeated by the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>A Man came at full Speed. The Throng gave way to his Approach. He was mounted on a Steed of Foam. In an In&s;tant he was off his Hor&s;e, on the Scaf|fold, and held <HI>Pythias</HI> &s;traitly embraced.</P>
<P>You are &s;afe, he cried, you are &s;afe, my Friend, my Beloved, the Gods be prai&s;ed, you are &s;afe! I now have nothing but Death to &s;uffer, and I am delivered from the Angui&s;h of tho&s;e Reproaches which I gave my&s;elf, for having endan|gered a Life &s;o much dearer than my own.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="119">
Pale, cold, and half Speechle&s;s in the Arms of his <HI>Damon, Pythias</HI> replied in broken Accents,&mdash;Fatal Ha&s;te!&mdash;cruel Impatience!&mdash;what envious Powers have wrought Impo&s;&s;ibilities in your Favour?&mdash;But, I will not be wholely di&s;appointed&mdash;Since I cannot die to &s;ave, I will not &s;urvive you.</P>
<P><HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> heard, beheld, and con&s;idered all with A&s;toni&s;hment. His Heart was touch'd. His Eyes were opened; and he could no longer refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to Truths &s;o inconte&s;tably approved by their Facts.</P>
<P>He de&s;cended from his Throne. He a&s;cended the Scaffold. Live, live ye in|comparable Pair! he exclaimed. Ye have borne unque&s;tionable Te&s;timony to the Ex|i&s;tence of Virtue, and that Virtue equally evinces the Certainty of the Exi&s;tence of a God to reward it. Live happy, live re|nowned! and, O, form me by your Pre|cepts, as ye have invited me by your Ex|ample, to be worthy of the Participation of &s;o &s;acred a Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>YOU bring your Arguments quite home, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;aid the Earl; the Under&s;tand|ing cannot reject what the Heart &s;o &s;en&s;i|bly feels. My Soul deeply acknowledges the Exi&s;tence of Virtue, with its e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="120" REF="120">and inherent Difference from Vice, and this Difference, I acknowledge, mu&s;t as ne|ce&s;&s;arily be founded in the Difference of the Principles from whence they proceed; but, what tho&s;e Principles are I know not; and I am equally a Stranger to what you intend by a Man's getting out of him|&s;elf in order to Happine&s;s. What am I to under&s;tand by the Term SELF, Mr. <HI>Meekly.</HI></P>
<P>Every Particle of Matter, my Lord, has a SELF or di&s;tinct Identity, ina&s;much as it cannot be any other Particle of Matter. Now, while it continues in this its State of SELFISHNESS or ab&s;olute Di&s;tinc|tion, it is utterly u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, and is to the Univer&s;e as tho' it were not. It has however a Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> (analogous or an&s;werable to <HI>De&s;ire</HI> in Mind) whereby it endeavours to derive to it&s;elf the Powers and Advantages of all other Portions of Matter. But when the DI|VINE INTELLIGENCE hath harmo|nized certain Quantities of &s;uch di&s;tinct Particles into certain animal or vegetable Sy&s;tems, this Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> in each is overcome, for each becomes at|tracted and drawn as it were from SELF, each yields up its Powers to the Benefit of the Whole, and then, and then only, be|comes capable and productive of Shape,
<PB N="121" REF="121">Colouring, Beauty, Flowers, Fragrance, and Fruits.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed now to ob&s;erve, my Lord, that this Operation in Matter is no other than a Manife&s;tation of the like Proce&s;s in Mind; and that no Soul was ever capable of any Degree of Virtue or Happine&s;s &s;ave &s;o far as it is drawn away, in its Affecti|ons, from SELF; &s;ave &s;o far as it is en|gaged in wi&s;hing, contriving, endeavour|ing, promoting, and rejoicing in the Wel|fare and Happine&s;s of others.</P>
<P>It is therefore that the Kingdom of Heaven is mo&s;t aptly, and mo&s;t beautiful|ly, compared to a Tree bearing Fruit and diffu&s;ing Odours, who&s;e Root is the PRINCIPLE of infinite Benevolence, and who&s;e Braches are the ble&s;&s;ed Mem|bers, receiving con&s;ummate Beatitude from the Act of Communication.</P>
<P>I think, indeed, &s;aid the Earl, that I can form &s;ome Sort of a Notion of &s;uch a Society in Heaven. But it would po&s;e you, Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> to exemplify your Po&s;i|tion from any Body of Men that ever were upon Earth.</P>
<P>Pray pardon me, my Lord, the States of <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> derived their Lu&s;tre and Power, their whole Preeminence and
<PB N="122" REF="122">Prai&s;e, from this Principle of <HI>Communication,</HI> which, in them, was called <HI>Love of Country.</HI> But this beatifying Principle was &s;till more eminently in&s;tanced in the Society of the Church of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who had all Things in common; who imparted their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to all Men, as every Man had need; and, thence, did eat their common Bread with <HI>Gladne&s;s and Singlene&s;s of Heart,</HI> prai&s;ing God, and having Favour with all People.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, my Lord, that you can form a Notion of &s;ome &s;uch Excellence in Hea|ven; but I can form no Notion of any Ex|cellence more admirable, in Heaven it&s;elf, than when a Man, in his pre&s;ent State of frail and depraved Nature, overbears his per&s;onal Fears of Pain and Mortality, and yields up his Body to a&s;&s;ured Perdition, for public Good, or for the &s;ake of tho&s;e whom it delighteth him to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over the In&s;tances of the Roman <HI>Regulus</HI> and the <HI>Decii,</HI> as al&s;o that of <HI>Leonidas</HI> and his three Hundred <HI>Spartans</HI> who devoted their Lives for the Liberties of <HI>Greece;</HI> was that Candidate le&s;s a Hero who, being rejected from being one of the&s;e Self-devoted, exclaimed, the Gods be prai&s;ed that there are three Hundred, in <HI>Sparta,</HI> better Men than my&s;elf! But, I come nearer our own Times and our
<PB N="123" REF="123">own Nation, to exemplify this Di&s;regard of SELF, the vital Source and Principle of every Virtue, in &s;ix Mechanics or Craft&s;|men of the City of <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the Third, after the Battle of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y,</HI> laid Siege to <HI>Calais.</HI> He had forti|fied his Camp in &s;o impregnable a Manner, that all the Efforts of <HI>France</HI> proved in|effectual to rai&s;e the Siege, or throw Suc|cours into the City. The Citizens howe|ver, under the Conduct of Count <HI>Vienne</HI> their gallant Governour, made an admira|ble Defence. Day after Day the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> effected many a Breach which they repeat|edly expected to &s;torm by Morning; but, when Morning appeared, they wonder'd to behold new Ramparts rai&s;ed, nightly erected out of the Ruins which the Day had made.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> had now put the Sickle into her &s;econd Harve&s;t &s;ince <HI>Edward</HI> with his victorious Army &s;at down before the Town. The Eyes of all Europe were in|tent on the I&s;&s;ue. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> made their Approaches and Attacks without Remi&s;&s;i|on; but the Citizens were as ob&s;tinate in repelling all their Efforts.</P>
<P>At length, Famine did more for <HI>Edward</HI> than Arms. After the Citizens had de|voured
<PB N="124" REF="124">the lean Carca&s;&s;es of their &s;tarved Cattle, they tore up old Foundations and Rubbi&s;h in &s;earch of Vermin. They fed on boiled Leather and the Weeds of ex|hau&s;ted Gardens, and a Mor&s;el of damag|ed Corn was accounted Matter of Luxury.</P>
<P>In this Extremity they re&s;olved to at|tempt the Enemy's Camp. They boldly &s;allied forth; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> joined Battle; and, after a long and de&s;perate Engage|ment, Count <HI>Vienne</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner; and the Citizens, who &s;urvived the Slaugh|ter, retired within their Gates.</P>
<P>On the Captivity of the Governour, the Command devolved upon <HI>Eu&s;tace Saint Pierre,</HI> the Mayor of the Town, a Man of mean Birth but of exalted Virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> now found him&s;elf under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of capitulating and offered to deli|ver, to <HI>Edward,</HI> the City, with all the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Wealth of the Inhabitants, provided he permitted them to depart with Life and Liberty.</P>
<P>As <HI>Edward</HI> had long &s;ince expected to a&s;cend the Throne of <HI>France,</HI> he was exa&s;|perated, to the la&s;t Degree, again&s;t the&s;e People, who&s;e &s;ole Valour had defeated his warme&s;t Hopes; he therefore determined to take an exemplary Revenge, though
<PB N="125" REF="125">he wi&s;hed to avoid the Imputation of Cruely. He an&s;wered, by Sir <HI>Walter Mauny,</HI> that they all de&s;erved capital Pu|ni&s;hment as ob&s;tinate Traitors to him, their true, and natural Sovereign. That, however, in his wonted Clemency, he con|&s;ented to pardon the Bulk of the Plebei|ans, provided they would deliver up to him &s;ix of their principal Citizens, with Halters about their Necks, as Victims of due Atonement for that Spirit of Rebellion with which they had enflamed the vulgar Herd.</P>
<P>All the Remains of this de&s;olate City were convened in the great Square, and, like Men arraign'd at a Tribunal from whence there was no Appeal, expected with beat|ing Hearts the Sentence of their Con|queror.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Walter</HI> had declared his Me&s;|age, Con&s;ternation and pale Di&s;may was impre&s;&s;ed on every Face. Each looked upon Death as his own inevitable Lot; for, how &s;hould they de&s;ire to be &s;aved at the Price propo&s;ed? whom had they to deliver &s;ave Parents, Brothers, Kindred, or valiant Neighbours who had &s;o often expo&s;ed their Lives in their Defence? To a long and dead Silence deep Sighs and Groans &s;ucceeded; till <HI>Eu&s;tace St. Pierre,</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="126">getting up to a little Eminence, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<Q><P>My Friends, we are brought to great Straits this Day. We mu&s;t either &s;ub|mit to the Terms of our cruel and en|&s;naring Conqueror; or yield up our tender Infants, our Wives, and cha&s;te Daughters to the bloody and brutal Lu&s;ts of the violating Soldiery.</P>
<P>We well know what the Tyrant in|tends, by his &s;pecious Offers of Mercy. It will not &s;atiate his Vengeance to make us merely mi&s;erable, he would al&s;o make us criminal, he would make us contemp|tible; he will grant us Life on no Con|dition &s;ave that of our being unworthy of it.</P>
<P>Look about you, my Friends, and fix your Eyes on the Per&s;ons, whom you wi&s;h to deliver up as the Victims of your own Safety. Which of the&s;e would ye appoint to the Rack, the Axe, or the Halter? Is there any here who has not watched for you, who has not fought for you, who has not bled for you? Who, through the length of this inveterate Siege, has not &s;uffered Fa|tigues and Mi&s;eries, a thou&s;and Times wor&s;e than Death, that you and yours might &s;urvive to Days of Peace and
<PB N="127" REF="127">Pro&s;perity? Is it your Pre&s;ervers, then, whom you would de&s;tine to De&s;tructi|on? you will not, you cannot do it. Ju&s;tice, Honour, Humanity make &s;uch a Trea&s;on impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Where then is our Re&s;ource? is there any Expedient left, whereby we may avoid Guilt and Infamy on the one Hand, or the De&s;olation and Horrours of a &s;acked City on the other? there is, my Friends, there is one Expedient left; a gracious, an excellent, a God|like Expedient! Is there any here to whom Virtue is dearer than Life? Let him offer him&s;elf an Oblation for the Safety of his People! He &s;hall not fail of a ble&s;&s;ed Approbation from that Power, who offer'd up his only Son for the Salvation of Mankind.</P></Q>
<P>He &s;poke&mdash;but a univer&s;al Silence en&s;ued. Each Man looked around for the Example of that Virtue and Magnanimity, in others, which all wi&s;hed to approve in them&s;elves, though they wanted the Re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Saint Pierre</HI> re&s;umed&mdash;<Q>It had been ba&s;e in me, my fellow Citi|zens to propo&s;e any Matter of Damage, to others, which I my&s;elf had not been willing to undergo in my own Per&s;on.
<PB N="128" REF="128">But I held it ungenerous to deprive any Man of that Preference and E&s;timation which might attend a fir&s;t Offer, on &s;o &s;ignal an Occa&s;ion. For I doubt not but there are many here as ready, nay more zealous of this Martyrdom than I can be, however Mode&s;ty and the Fear of imputed O&s;tentation may withold them from being foremo&s;t in exhibiting their Merits.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Indeed, the Station, to which the Captivity of Lord <HI>Vienne</HI> has unhappily rai&s;ed me, imparts a Right to be the fir&s;t in giving my Life for your Sakes. I give it freely, I give it chearfully; who comes next?</Q></P>
<P>Your Son! exclaimed a Youth, not yet come to Maturity. &mdash; <Q>Ah my Child! cried <HI>Saint Pierre,</HI> I am, then, twice &s;acrificed. &mdash; But, no &mdash; I have rather begotten thee a &s;econd Time. &mdash; Thy Years are few but full, my Son; the Victim of Virtue has reached the utmo&s;t Purpo&s;e and Goal of Mortality. Who next, my Friends? &mdash; This is the Hour of Heroes.</Q> &mdash; Your Kin&s;man, cried <HI>John D'Aire!</HI> your Kin&s;man, cried <HI>James Wi&s;&s;ant!</HI> your Kin&s;man, cried <HI>Peter Wi&s;&s;ant!</HI> &mdash; Ah, exclaimed Sir <HI>Walter Mauny,</HI> bur&s;ting into Tears, why was I not a Citizen of <HI>Calais?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="129">
The &s;ixth Victim was &s;till wanting, but was quickly &s;upplied, by Lot, from Num|bers who were now emulous of &s;o ennobling an Example.</P>
<P>The Keys of the City were then deli|vered to Sir <HI>Walter.</HI> He took the &s;ix Pri&s;oners into his Cu&s;tody. He ordered the Gates to be opened, and gave Charge to his Attendants to conduct the remaining Citizens, with their Families, through the Camp of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Before they departed, however, they de|&s;ired Permi&s;&s;ion to take their la&s;t Adieu of their Deliverers &mdash; What a Parting, what a Scene! They crouded with their Wives and Children about <HI>Saint Pierre</HI> and his fellow Pri&s;oners. They embraced, they clung around, they fell pro&s;trate before them. They groaned, they wept aloud; and the joint Clamour of their Mourning pa&s;&s;ed the Gates of the City and was heard throughout the Camp.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by this Time, were ap|pri&s;ed of what pa&s;&s;ed within <HI>Calais.</HI> They heard the Voice of Lamentation, and their Souls were touched with Compa&s;&s;ion. Each of the Soldiers prepared a Portion of their own Victuals to welcome and enter|tain the half fami&s;hed Inhabitants; and
<PB N="130" REF="130">they loaded them with as much as their pre&s;ent Weakne&s;s was able to bear, in or|der to &s;upply them with Su&s;tenance by the Way.</P>
<P>At length, <HI>Saint Pierre</HI> and his fellow Victims appeared under the conduct of Sir <HI>Walter</HI> and a Guard. All the Tents of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were in&s;tantly emptied. The Soldiers poured from all Parts, and arrang|ed them&s;elves on each Side, to behold, to contemplate, to admire this little Band of Patriots as they pa&s;&s;ed. They bowed down to them on all Sides. They mur|mured their applau&s;e of that Virtue which they could not but revere, even in Ene|mies. And they regarded tho&s;e Ropes, which they had voluntarily a&s;&s;umed about their Necks, as En&s;igns of greater Dignity than that of the Briti&s;h Garter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had reached the Pre|&s;ence, <HI>Mauny!</HI> &s;ays the Monarch, are the&s;e the principal Inhabitants of <HI>Calais?</HI> They are, &s;ays <HI>Mauny,</HI> they are not only the principal Men of <HI>Calais,</HI> they are the prin|cipal Men of <HI>France,</HI> my Lord, if Virtue has any Share in the Act of ennobling. Were they delivered peaceably, &s;ays <HI>Ed|ward;</HI> was there no Re&s;i&s;tance, no Com|motion among the People? Not in the lea&s;t, my Lord; the People would all have peri&s;hed, rather than have delivered the
<PB N="131" REF="131">lea&s;t of the&s;e to your Maje&s;ty. They are Self-delivered, Self-devoted, and come to offer up their ine&s;timable Heads as an am|ple Equivalent for the Ran&s;om of Thou|&s;ands.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> was &s;ecretly piqued at this Re|ply of Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> but, he knew the Privi|lege of a Briti&s;h Subject, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his Re&s;entment. Experience, &s;ays he hath ever &s;hewn that Lenity only &s;erves to in|vite People to new Crimes. Severity, at Times, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to deter Subjects into Submi&s;&s;ion by Puni&s;hment and Example. Go, he cried to an Officer, lead the&s;e Men to Execution. Your Re|bellion, continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to <HI>Saint Pierre,</HI> your Rebellion again&s;t me, the natural Heir of your Crown, is highly aggravated by your pre&s;ent Pre&s;umption and Affront of my Power.&mdash;We have nothing to a&s;k of your Maje&s;ty, &s;aid <HI>Eu&s;|tace,</HI> &s;ave what you cannot refu&s;e us.&mdash;What is that?&mdash;Your E&s;teem, my Lord, &s;aid <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> and went out with his Companions.</P>
<P>At this In&s;tant, a Sound of Triumph was hear'd throughout the Camp. The Queen had ju&s;t arrived, with a powerful Rein|forcement of tho&s;e gallant Soldiers, at the Head of whom &s;he had conquer'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and taken their King Captive.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="132">
Sir <HI>Walter Mauny</HI> flew to receive her Maje&s;ty, and briefly inform'd her of the Particulars re&s;pecting the &s;ix Victims.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as She had been welcomed by <HI>Edward</HI> and his Court, She de&s;ir'd a pri|vate Audience. My Lord, &s;aid She, the Que&s;tion I am to enter upon is not touch|ing the Lives of a few Mechanics; it re|&s;pects a Matter, more e&s;timable than the Lives of all the Natives of <HI>France,</HI> it re|&s;pects the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, it re&s;pects the Glory of my <HI>Edward,</HI> my Hu&s;|band, my King.</P>
<P>You think you have &s;entenced Six of your Enemies to Death. No, my Lord, they have &s;entenced them&s;elves, and their Ex|ecution would be the Execution of their own Orders, not the Orders of <HI>Edward.</HI></P>
<P>They have behaved them&s;elves worthi|ly, they have behaved them&s;elves greatly, I cannot but re&s;pect, while I envy, while I hate them, for leaving us no Share in the Honour of this Action, &s;ave that of gran|ting a poor and indi&s;pen&s;able Pardon.</P>
<P>I admit they have de&s;erved every Thing that is evil at your Hands. They have pro|ved the mo&s;t inveterate and efficacious of your Enemies. They, alone, have with|&s;tood
<PB N="133" REF="133">the rapid Cour&s;e of your Conque&s;ts, and have witheld from You the Crown to which You were born. Is it therefore that You would reward them? that you would gratify their De&s;ires, that you would in|dulge their Ambition, and enwreath them with everla&s;ting Glory and Applau&s;e?</P>
<P>But, if &s;uch a Death would exalt Me|chanics over the Fame of the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious Heroes, how would the Name of my <HI>Edward,</HI> with all his Triumphs and Honours be tarni&s;hed thereby! Would it not be &s;aid that Magnanimity and Virtue are grown odious in the Eyes of the Monarch of <HI>Britain?</HI> And that the Objects, whom he de&s;tines to the Puni&s;hment of Felons, are the very Men who de&s;erve the Prai&s;e and E&s;teem of Mankind The Stage, on which they &s;hould &s;uffer, would be to them a Stage of Honour, but a Stage of Shame to <HI>Edward,</HI> a Reproach to his Conque&s;ts, a dark and indelible Di&s;grace to his Name.</P>
<P>No, my Lord. Let us rather di&s;appoint the &s;aucy Ambition of the&s;e Burghers, who wi&s;h to inve&s;t them&s;elves with Glory at our Expence. We cannot, indeed, wholely deprive them of the merit of a Sacrifice &s;o nobly intended; but we may cut them &s;hort of their De&s;ires; in the Place of that Death, by which their Glory would be con&s;ummate, let us bury them under Gifts,
<PB N="134" REF="134">let us put them to Shame with Prai&s;es; we &s;hall thereby defeat them of that popular Opinion which never fails to attend tho&s;e who &s;uffer in the Cau&s;e of Virtue.</P>
<P>I am convinced; you have prevailed; be it &s;o, cryed <HI>Edward,</HI> prevent the Execution; have them in&s;tantly before us!</P>
<P>They came, when the Queen, with an A&s;pect and Accents diffu&s;ing Sweetne&s;s, thus be&s;poke them.</P>
<P>Natives of France, and Inhabitants of <HI>Calais,</HI> Ye have put us to va&s;t Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure in the Recovery of our ju&s;t and natural Inheritance; but, you acted up to the be&s;t of an erroneous Judg|ment, and we admire and honour in you that Valour and Virtue, by which we are &s;o long kept out of our rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>You noble Burghers, you excellent Citi|zens! though you were tenfold the Ene|mies of our Per&s;on and our Throne, we can feel nothing, on our Part, &s;ave Re&s;pect and Affection for You. You have been &s;ufficiently te&s;ted. We loo&s;e your Chains, we &s;natch You from the Scaffold; and we thank You for that Le&s;&s;on of Humiliation which you teach us, when you &s;hew us that Excellence is not of Blood, of Title, or Station; that Virtue gives a Dignity &s;uperior to that of
<PB N="135" REF="135">Kings; and that Tho&s;e, whom the Al|mighty informs with Sentiments like yours, are ju&s;tly and eminently rai&s;ed above all human Di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>You are now free to depart to your Kinsfolk, your Countrymen, to all Tho&s;e who&s;e Lives and Liberties You have &s;o nobly redeemed, provided you refu&s;e not to carry with You the due Tokens of our E&s;teem.</P>
<P>Yet, we would rather bind You, to our&s;elves, by every endearing Obligation; and for this Purpo&s;e, we offer to You your Choice of the Gifts and Honours that <HI>Ed|ward</HI> has to be&s;tow. Rivals for Fame, but always Friends to Virtue, we wi&s;h that <HI>England</HI> were entitled to call You her Sons.</P>
<P>Ah my Country, exclaimed <HI>Saint Pierre,</HI> it is now that I tremble for You. <HI>Edward</HI> could only win your Cities, but <HI>Philippa</HI> conquers Hearts.</P>
<P>Brave <HI>Saint Pierre,</HI> &s;aid the Queen, wherefore look you &s;o dejected?&mdash;Ah Madam! replied <HI>Saint Pierre,</HI> when I meet with &s;uch another Opportunity of dying, I &s;hall not regret that I &s;urvived this Day.</P>
<P>Here a long Pau&s;e en&s;ued. At length the Earl recollected him&s;elf. Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> &s;ais he, You have now proved to me your
<PB N="136" REF="136">Po&s;ition more effectually, more convincing|ly, than all the Powers of Ratiocination could po&s;&s;ibly do. While you related the Story of tho&s;e divine Citizens, I was im|perceptibly &s;tolen away and won entirely from Self. I entered into all their Intere&s;ts, their Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affections; and was wrapt, as it were, into a new World of delightful Sen&s;ibilites. Is this what you call Virtue, what you call Happine&s;s?</P>
<P>A good deal of it, my Lord. There are in Nature but two Kinds of Self; in other Words, there are but two Sorts of Wills in the Univer&s;e; the Will of infinite Wi&s;dom, of infinite Benevolence, going forth in Beauty and Beatitude on all Creatures; And the Will of the Creature, de&s;iring, attract|ing, envying, coveting, and rending all Things, from All, to its own Intere&s;t and Advantage. In the fir&s;t Will &s;ub&s;i&s;ts all po&s;&s;ible Good, from the Second ari&s;es all po&s;&s;ible Evil; and did not the fir&s;t Will, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, inform and meliorate the Second, the Will of every Creature would be an <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> his Hand would be a|gain&s;t every One, and every One's Hand again&s;t him, and there would be nothing but Strife and Di&s;traction, Hatred, Horrour, and Mi&s;ery throughout the Creation.</P>
<P>Hence it follows that, as there is but one Will, from Eternity, infinitely wi&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="137">to di&s;cern what is be&s;t throughout the Uni|ver&s;e, infinitely good to de&s;ire the Accom|pli&s;hment of what is be&s;t, and infinitely powerful to put what is be&s;t in Execution; every Will that is not inform'd by this ONE WILL, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity act in Ignorance, in Blindne&s;s, and Error. I will further affirm that every Act of every Will, that is not informed by the ONE WILL of GOODNESS mu&s;t, of equal ne|ce&s;&s;ity, be the Act of Malevolence.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of that, re|plied the Earl. I well perceive that God can give to intelligent Beings an Exi&s;tence or Identity di&s;tinct from him&s;elf, for I &s;ee that he has done it. What &s;hould there|fore prevent him from giving Qualities as di&s;tinct from him&s;elf as the E&s;&s;ence? why might he not impart, to any limited Degree, Capacity, Di&s;cernment, Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s? Might not &s;uch a Being in&s;tantly perceive, to a va&s;t Extent, the Relations of Things, with their &s;everal Fitne&s;&s;es and Di&s;agreements? would he not con&s;equently be enamoured of what was right and beautiful? would he not act agreeable to &s;uch a ju&s;t Approbation? and would not &s;uch Actions be fitly accounted the Act of Virtue?</P>
<P>At this In&s;tant a Me&s;&s;enger arrived on the Spur. He brought word to Mr. <HI>Meekly</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="138">that his Friend, Mr. <HI>Hu&s;bands,</HI> was taken &s;uddenly ill and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted to &s;ee him directly; whereupon Mr. <HI>Meekly,</HI> who preferred any Matter of Charity to all other Con&s;iderations, immediately got up, made a &s;ilent Bow and vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>TO RETURN to our Hero. As &s;oon as he was new rigged, he pre&s;s'd for ano|ther Vi&s;it to his Patron; who received him, with accu&s;tomed Tenderne&s;s, but greatly wonder'd at his Pea&s;ant Dre&s;s. Nur&s;e, then, recited to him the whole Adventure of the fritter'd Robeings. Whereat, the old Gentleman, in a manner devoured him with the Eagerne&s;s of his Care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>When Nur&s;e and <HI>Harry</HI> were departed, he called to him his old Dome&s;tic. <HI>James,</HI> &s;ays he, with a Tear yet &s;tanding in his Eye, I can no longer live without the Company of this dear Child, ha&s;ten, there|fore, the Orders that I have already given you, and let all Things be in Readine&s;s for the fir&s;t Opportunity. The Dome&s;tic, who had caught the filent Habit of his Ma&s;ter, with a Bow, a&s;&s;ented, and retired.</P>
<P><HI>Autumn</HI> was now advanced, and Lord <HI>Dickey,</HI> with his Brother, a Number of little A&s;&s;ociates, and an attending Foot|man, got leave to go to the Cop&s;e, a
<PB N="139" REF="139">Nutting. As the Children were perfectly acquainted with the Way, the Servant de|&s;ired to &s;tay behind, a while, in order to provide Hooks for pulling down the Branches. This was granted; and forth they all i&s;&s;ued in high Chat and Spirits.</P>
<P>The Cop&s;e lay, at &s;ome Di&s;tance, on one Side of the Park behind the Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e; but, when they had nearly ap|proached the Place of their De&s;tination, <HI>Harry</HI> mi&s;&s;ed a Garter, and, promi&s;ing &s;peedily to rejoin his Companions, went back to &s;eek it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, his A&s;&s;ociates, on entering the Wood, met with another little Po&s;&s;e of the Village Fry, who were on their Return, one of whom carried a Bag of Nuts that &s;eem'd bulkier than the Bearer. So, Gentlemen, &s;ays Lord <HI>Dickey,</HI> where are you going? Why, Home, where &s;hould we go? &s;ays a little Boor, &s;ullenly. And, pray, what have you been doing, &s;ays the Lord. Gue&s;s, &s;ays the Boor. Is it Nuts that you have got in that Bag? demanded the Lord. A&s;k, To-morrow; an&s;wered the Boor. Sirrah, &s;ais <HI>Dickey,</HI> a little provoked, how dare you to come and pull Nuts here, without our Leave? Why, as for that, Ma&s;ter <HI>Dickey,</HI> replied the other, I know you well enough, and I wouldn't a&s;k your Leave, an' you were
<PB N="140" REF="140">twenty Lords, not I. Sirrah, &s;ays <HI>Dickey,</HI> I have a great Mind to take your Nuts from you, and to give you as good a Beat|ing, into the Bargain, as ever you got in your Life. As for that, Ma&s;ter <HI>Dickey,</HI> coolly an&s;wered the Villager, you mu&s;t do Both or Neither. Here I lay down my Nuts between us; and now come any Two of your Watergruel Regiment, one down t'other come on, and if I don't give ye your Belly fulls, why, then, take my Nuts, and welcome, to make up the Want.</P>
<P>This gallant Invitation was accepted, on the Spot. Lord <HI>Richard</HI> cho&s;e his Com|panion in Arms; and Both appeared quite flu&s;h and confident of Victory. For, though neither of them had been ver&s;ed in the Gymna&s;tic Exerci&s;es, they didn't want Courage and they knew that the Challen|ger was their Inferior in Strength and in Years.</P>
<P>But, unhappily for the&s;e two Champi|ons of Quality, <HI>Tommy Truck,</HI> their Ad|ver&s;ary, had, like <HI>Harry,</HI> been a Brui&s;er, from two Years old and upward; and was held, in Veneration, as their Leader, and their Chief, by many who were his Supe|riors in Age and Stature.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="141">
Lord <HI>Richard</HI> began the A&s;&s;ault, but, was down in a Twinkling. To him his Friend &s;ucceeded, but, with no better For|tune. A Swing or Trip of <HI>Tommy</HI>'s &s;ent them, in&s;tantly, as <HI>Alcides</HI> &s;ent <HI>Antaeus,</HI> to gather Strength from their Mother-Earth. And, though the&s;e Summer Heroes, like the young Roman Nobility at the Battle of <HI>Phar&s;alia,</HI> were &s;olely intent on defending their pretty Faces from Annoyance, yet <HI>Tommy,</HI> at the third Turn, had bloodied them, Both.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> who was now on his Return, perceived the Engagement, and, running up, and, ru&s;hing between the Combatants, interpo&s;ed, with a Voice of Authority, and parted the Fray.</P>
<P>Having enquired, and duely informed him&s;elf of the Merits of the Ca&s;e, he, fir&s;t turned him to Lord <HI>Richard,</HI> and &s;aid, O, Brother <HI>Dickey,</HI> Brother <HI>Dickey,</HI> you ought not to hinder poor Boys from pull|ing a few dirty Nuts, what &s;ignifies 'em? Then, turning to the Challenger; his old Acquaintance; <HI>Tommy,</HI> &s;ays he, did you know that <HI>Dickey</HI> was my Brother? Yes, &s;ays <HI>Tommy,</HI> rudely, and what tho' of I did. O, nothing at all, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> but I want to &s;peak with you, <HI>Tommy.</HI> Whereup|on he took the Conqueror under the Arm, and walked away, with him, very
<PB N="142" REF="142">lovingly, in all Appearance, looking about to take Care that none of the Boys fol|low'd him.</P>
<P>Mean Time, the little Gentry threw out their Invectives, in Profu&s;ion, again&s;t our departed Hero. I think, &s;ays one, that Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> had as much to blame in <HI>Tommy</HI> as Lord <HI>Dickey.</HI> Ay, &s;ays ano|ther, one would think he might as well have taken his Brother's Part, as that Blackguard's. Indeed, it was very naugh|ty of him, &s;ays a Third. For my Part, &s;ays a Fourth, I never will have any Thing more to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>While, thus, they vilified their late Friend, he and his fellow Champion walk|ed, Arm in Arm, in a &s;ullen and uninter|rupted Silence. Till, coming to a &s;mall Opening, in a &s;ecreted Part of the Wood, <HI>Harry</HI> quitted his Companion, de&s;ired him to &s;trip, and, in&s;tantly, ca&s;t a&s;ide his own Hat, Coat, and Wai&s;tcoat. Why &s;hould I &s;trip, &s;ays <HI>Tommy?</HI> To Box, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> Why &s;hould you box with me, <HI>Harry?</HI> &s;ure I didn't &s;trike you, &s;ays <HI>Tom.</HI> Yes, Sir, replied our Hero, you &s;truck me when you &s;truck <HI>Dickey,</HI> and knew that he was my Brother. Nay, <HI>Harry,</HI> cried <HI>Tom,</HI> if it's Fight you are for, I'll give you enough of it, I warrant you.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="143">
<HI>Tom</HI> was about eight Months older than <HI>Harry,</HI> his equal in the Practice of Arms, and much the &s;tronger. But, <HI>Harry</HI> was full as tall; and his Motions, quicker than Thought, prevented the Ward of the mo&s;t experienced Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Together they ru&s;hed, like two little Tygers. At once, they &s;truck and parri|ed, and, watching every open, they darted their little Fi&s;ts, like Engines, at each other. But <HI>Tom,</HI> marking the Quickne&s;s, and feeling the Smart of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Strokes, &s;uddenly leapt within his Arm, bore him down to the Earth, and triumphantly gave him the fir&s;t ri&s;ing Blow.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> ro&s;e, indignant, but warn'd, by the Strength of his Adver&s;ary, to better Caution. He now fought, more aloof, and as <HI>Tom</HI> pre&s;&s;ed upon him, he at once guarded, &s;truck, and wheel'd, like an ex|perienced Cock, without quitting the Pit of Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> finding him&s;elf wholely foiled by this <HI>Parthian</HI> Method of Combat, again ru&s;h'd upon his Enemy, who was, now, aware of the Shock. They clo&s;ed, they grappled, they caught each other by the Shoulders, join'd Head to Head, and Brea&s;t to Brea&s;t, and &s;tood, like two Pil|lars,
<PB N="144" REF="144">merely &s;upported by their Bearing again&s;t one another. Again they &s;hifted the left Arm, caught each other about the Neck, and cuffed and punch'd at Face and Stomach, without Mercy or Remi&s;&s;ion; till <HI>Tom,</HI> impatient of this Length of Battle, gave <HI>Harry</HI> a &s;ide Swing, and, <HI>Harry</HI> giv|ing <HI>Tom</HI> a Trip at the &s;ame Time, they fell Side by Side, together upon the Earth.</P>
<P>They ro&s;e, and retreated, to draw Breath, as by mutal Con&s;ent. They glar|ed on one another with an Eye of vindic|tive Apprehen&s;ion. For neither of them could now boa&s;t of more Optics than <HI>Poliphemus;</HI> and, from their Forehead to their Shoes, they were in one Gore of Blood.</P>
<P>Again they flew upon each other, again they &s;truck, foined, and defended, and al|ternately, pre&s;s'd on and retreated in Turns, till <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;pying an Open, dart|ed his Fi&s;t, like a Shot, into the remain|ing Eye of his Enemy. <HI>Tom,</HI> finding him|&s;elf in utter Darkne&s;s, in&s;tantly, &s;prung upon his Foe, and endeavoured to grapple; but <HI>Harry,</HI> with equal Agility, avoided the Shock, and, traver&s;ing here and there beat his Adver&s;ary at Plea&s;ure. Till <HI>Tom</HI> cried out, I yield I yield, <HI>Harry,</HI> for I can't &s;ee to fight, any more.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="145">
Then, <HI>Harry</HI> took <HI>Tom</HI> by the Hand and led him to his Cloaths, and, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to dre&s;s, he, next, did the &s;ame friendly Office to him&s;elf. Then, Arm in Arm, they returned much more loving, in reality, than they &s;et out, hav|ing been beaten into a true Re&s;pect and Affection for each other.</P>
<P>Sometime before this, the Footman had joined his young Lord, with the &s;everal Implements requi&s;ite for Nutting. They had, already, pulled down great Quanti|ties; the young Quality had &s;tuffed their Pockets; and the little Plebeians, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, were now permitted to be bu&s;ie in gathering up the Refu&s;e. When all, turning at the Cry of there's <HI>Harry,</HI> there's <HI>Tom,</HI> they perceived our two Champions, advancing, lei&s;urely, but Hand in Hand, as Friends and Brothers.</P>
<P>They had left their Cloaths unbuttoned, for the Benefit of the cooling Air; and, as they approached, their Companions were frozen into A&s;toni&s;hment, at the Sight of their two Friends all covered with Crim&s;on.</P>
<P>They were neither able to advance to meet them, nor to &s;peak, when they ar|rived. 'Till Lord <HI>Dickey,</HI> fir&s;t, inquired into this bloody Cata&s;trophe, and, <HI>Harry</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="146">remaining wholely &s;ilent on the Subject; blind <HI>Tommy</HI> cried out, why, Ma&s;ter <HI>Dickey,</HI> the Truth is, that <HI>Harry,</HI> beat me, becau&s;e I beat You. Then <HI>Dickey,</HI> feeling a &s;udden Gu&s;h of Gratitude and Affection ri&s;ing up in his Bo&s;om, look|ed wi&s;tfully on his Brother, and &s;aid, with a plaintive Voice, O Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> you are &s;adly hurt; and, turning about, he began to weep mo&s;t bitterly. But <HI>Harry</HI> &s;aid, Shaw! Brother <HI>Dickey,</HI> don't cry Man, I don't matter it of the Head of a bra&s;s Pin. Then turning to the Footman, with <HI>Tom</HI> &s;till in his Hand, he cried, here <HI>John,</HI> take that Bag of Nuts and poor blind <HI>Tommy</HI> to my Mammy's, and tell Daddy that I de&s;ire him to &s;ee them both &s;afe home.</P>

In tho&s;e very early Days, the People of <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> were extremely rude and ignorant; they acknowledged no Laws, &s;ave the Dictates of their own Will or the Will of their Rulers. <HI>Lycurgus</HI> might have a&s;&s;umed the Sceptre; but his Ambition a&s;pired to a much more eleva|ted and durable Dominion, over the Souls, Manners, and Conduct of this People and their Po&s;terity. He framed a Body of the mo&s;t extraordinary In&s;titutions that ever enteredinto the Heart or Head of Man. Next to tho&s;e of our DIVINE LE|GISLATOR, they were intended <HI>to form a new Creature.</HI> He prevailed upon the Rich to make an equal Di&s;tribution of their Lands with the Poor. He prohibited the U&s;e of all &s;uch Money as was current among other Nations, and, thereby prohi|bited
<PB N="149" REF="149">the Importation of the Means and Materials of Pomp and Luxury. He en|joined them to feed, in common, on &s;im|ple and frugal Fare.

<P>Hero, heros, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the three Languages, &s;ignify a Demigod, or one who is &s;uperior to mere Man. But, how can this Superiority or Di&s;tinction be &s;hewn? The &s;erene Acts of Beneficence, the &s;mall and &s;till Voice of Goodne&s;s are neither accompanied by Noi&s;e nor O&s;tenta|tion. It is Uproar and Tumult, rather the Tumbling of &s;ack'd Cities, the Shrieks of ravi&s;h'd Matrons, and the Groans of dying Nations that fill the Trump of Fame. Men of Power and Ambition find Di&s;tinc|tion and Glory, very readily, attainable in this Way; as it is incomparably more ea&s;y to de&s;troy than to create, to give Death than to give Life, to pull down than to build up, to bring Deva&s;tation and Mi&s;ery rather than Plenty and Peace and Pro&s;pe|rity upon Earth.</P>

<P>From the Beginning of Things (a long Time ago) the joint Invention of Mankind has di&s;covered but two Methods of procur|ing Su&s;tenance on Earth, the Fir&s;t by the Labour of their own Hands, the &s;econd by employing the Hands of others.</P>

<P>Among tho&s;e who will not labour, we may number all who have the Happine&s;s of being born to no Manner of End; &s;uch as the <HI>Monks</HI> of every Country, the <HI>Der|vi&s;es</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the <HI>Bramins</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> and the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the&s;e free and poli&s;hed Nations.</P>

<P>Among tho&s;e who di&s;turb the Labour of others, I reckon all your ra&s;cally <HI>Alex|anders</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> whether antient or modern, who, in their Fits of Frenzy and Folly, &s;camper about, breaking the Lan|terns and beating the Watch of this World, to the great Amazement of Women and Terrour of little Children; and, who &s;eem to think that Heaven gave No&s;es and Heads, for no End in Nature but to be blooded and cracked.

<P>THE young Gentlemen were, now, upon their Return; and, as they approached the Hou&s;e, they crouded about <HI>Harry</HI> to keep him from being &s;een, till he took an Opportunity of &s;lipping away and &s;tealing up to his Chamber. He now grew &s;tiff and &s;ore, and his Nur&s;e, hav|ing got an Intimation of what had hap|pened, hurried up to him, and wept over him with abundant Tears of cordial Affec|tion. She &s;trait, undre&s;&s;ed, and put him to Bed; and, having ordered &s;ome White-Wine Whey, of which &s;he made him drink plentifully, &s;he, al&s;o, undre&s;&s;ed, and went to bed to him, and <HI>Harry,</HI> ca&s;t|ing his little Arm about her Neck, and, putting his Head in her Bo&s;om, was fa&s;t in a Twinkling.</P>
<P>By this, <HI>John</HI> had returned from the Execution of his Commi&s;&s;ion. He had been fully apprized by <HI>Tommy,</HI> on the Road, of all the Circum&s;tances relating to this bloody Bu&s;ine&s;s; and, going to his Lord and Lady, he gave them the whole Detail, occa&s;ionally dwelling, and expatia|ting on <HI>Harry</HI>'s Courage, his Prowe&s;s, his Honour, and his Genero&s;ity. They could, now, no longer forbear indulging them|&s;elves
<PB N="157" REF="157">with the Sight of a Child, in whom they held them&s;elves honoured, above all Titles. They &s;tole, gently, up Stairs; and, having got a Peep at <HI>Harry,</HI> and ob|&s;erved that he was fa&s;t a&s;leep, they &s;tole, as &s;oftly, back again, each inwardly exult|ing in their glorious Boy.</P>
<P>Our Hero was &s;carce recovered, from his Wounds and Brui&s;es, when, on a Day, he met a little Beggar Boy at the Hall-Door, half naked, and whinging, and &s;hivering with Cold. His Heart was, in|&s;tantly, touched with wonted Compa&s;&s;ion; and, taking him by the Hand, what is your Name, my poor little Boy, &s;ays <HI>Harry? Neddy,</HI> Sir, &s;ays the Child. And, where's your Daddy and Mammy? O, Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Ned,</HI> I have no Daddy nor Mam|my in the World wide. Don't cry, don't cry, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I have &s;everal Daddies and Mammies, and I'll give you One or Two of 'em. But, where did you leave your Cloaths, <HI>Neddy?</HI> I haven't any, Sir, replied the Child in a piteous Accent. Well well, it don't matter, <HI>Neddy,</HI> for I have more Cloaths, too, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> So, taking him again by the Hand, he led him up to his Apartment, without being perceived of any; and, helping him to &s;trip, he ran to his Clo&s;et for the Shirt which he had la&s;t thrown off, and put it on the new Comer with equal Ha&s;te and
<PB N="158" REF="158">Delight. He, next, ran for the entire Suit that his bearded Dada had given him, and, having helped, and &s;hewn him how to put on the Breeches, he drew on the Stockings and Shoes with his own Hands. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded the Coat and Wai&s;tcoat, and <HI>Ned</HI> was, now, full as well rigg'd as his Benefactor.</P>
<P>Never had our Hero enjoyed him&s;elf, &s;o highly, as while he was thus employed. When he had fini&s;hed his Operations, he chuckled and &s;miled, turn'd <HI>Ned,</HI> round and round, walked here and there about him, and was as proud of him, as if he had been wholely of his own making.</P>
<P>He now, again, became thoughtful, foreca&s;ting in his Mind the Particulars that might further be requi&s;ite for the Accommodation of his Gue&s;t; for he was grown too fond of him to think of parting &s;uddenly. He then recollected an adjoin|ing Lumber-Room, and, taking <HI>Ned</HI> with him, they found a little old Mattre&s;s, which, with united Strength they dragged forth, and lodged in a convenient Corner of the Clo&s;et. To this they added a Pair of old Blanketts, and <HI>Harry,</HI> having &s;pread them for <HI>Ned</HI>'s Repo&s;e, in the be&s;t Man|ner he was able, a&s;ked his Dependent if he was yet hungry; Yes, very, very hungry indeed, Sir, cried <HI>Ned.</HI> No &s;oon|er
<PB N="159" REF="159">&s;aid, than <HI>Harry</HI> flew down to the Kitchen, and, looking about, and &s;pying a large Porringer of Milk and a Luncheon of Bread, that one of the Servants had provided for a young Favourite of their own, he &s;eized upon them like a Hawk, and ha&s;t'ning, again to his Chamber, de|livered them to <HI>Neddy</HI> who, already, had half devoured them with his Eyes. <HI>Ned,</HI> in&s;tantly, fell to with the Rapture of a Cormorant, or any Rapture that can be &s;uppo&s;ed le&s;s than that of his Friend <HI>Harry,</HI> who &s;tood over him with the Feelings of a Parent Turtle; that feeds his Young with the Meat derived from his own Bowels.</P>
<P>For a few Days, <HI>Harry</HI> kept his Depen|dent &s;hut up in his Chamber, or Clo&s;et, without the Privity of any of the Family, except Nur&s;e, to whom he had reveal'd the Affair under the Seal of the &s;tricte&s;t Secre&s;y.</P>
<P>But, on a cro&s;s Day, <HI>Su&s;y</HI> the Hou&s;e|maid, having entered with a new Broom into our Hero's Apartment, perceived, in a Corner, the tatter'd Depo&s;ite of <HI>Ned</HI>'s original Robeings, and, lifting them, at a cautious Di&s;tance, with a Finger and Thumb, &s;he perceived, al&s;o, as many o|ther Philo&s;ophers have done, that there is no part of this Globe which is not peo|pled with Nations of Animals, if Man
<PB N="160" REF="160">had but Attention, and Optics duely ac|commodated to the Vi&s;ion. She dropt the living Garment, as though &s;he had ta|ken up a burning Hor&s;e Shoe; and was, in&s;tantly, peopled, by her prolific Imagi|nation, with Tribes of the &s;ame Species from Head to Foot.</P>
<P>In this Fit of Di&s;gu&s;t, <HI>Su&s;y</HI> happen'd, unfortunately, to &s;tep into the Clo&s;et, and &s;pyed <HI>Ned</HI> in a dark Corner, where he had &s;quatted and drawn him&s;elf up to the Size of a Hedge-hog. She, immediately flew at him, like one of the <HI>Eumenides,</HI> and dragged him forth to the Light, as <HI>Hercules</HI> is &s;aid to have haled <HI>Cacus</HI> from his Den. She que&s;tioned him, with a Voice of implacable Authority, and <HI>Ned,</HI> with humble and ingenuous Tears, con|fe&s;&s;ed the whole Adventure. But <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> no way melted, exclaimed, what, Sirrah, have you, and your Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> a mind to breed an Affection in the Hou&s;e? I will remit of no &s;uch Doings, for I have an utter Conver&s;ion to Beggar-Brats and Vermil. She then commanded him to bundle up his old Raggs, and, driving him down Stairs before her, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the Hall-Door with a Pair of &s;mart Boxes on each Side of his Head, and ordered him never more to Defend her Sight.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="161">
Poor <HI>Ned,</HI> went weeping and wailing, from the Door, when who &s;hould he &s;ee, at about fifty Paces, di&s;tant, but his be|loved Patron <HI>Harry,</HI> who had been cut|ting a Switch from the next Hedge. To him he ran, with Precipitation. <HI>Harry,</HI> touched with a Compa&s;&s;ion not free from Re&s;entment, to &s;ee his Favourite in Tears, demanded the Cau&s;e of his apparent Di&s;|tre&s;s, which <HI>Ned</HI> truely related. Our Hero, thereupon, became thoughtful and moody; and, judging that <HI>Su&s;y</HI> had not acted thus without Authority, he conceiv|ed a general Di&s;gu&s;t at a Family who had treated him &s;o injuriou&s;ly in the Per&s;on of his <HI>Neddy;</HI> but, comforting his Depen|dent the be&s;t he could, come <HI>Neddy,</HI> &s;ays he, don't cry, my Man; I will bring you, that I will, to my own dear Dada, and he will welcome and love you, for my Sake. Then, making his Way through a &s;mall Breach in the neighbouring Hedge, he or|dered <HI>Ned</HI> to follow him, and flew acro&s;s the Field, like a Bird of Pa&s;&s;age, in a di|rect Line to his Patron's.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman &s;aw him approach|ing and gave Sign to his antient Dome&s;tic, who withdrew, with Precipitation. He received and care&s;&s;ed our Hero with more than u&s;ual Tran&s;port, and who, my Dear &s;ays he, is this pretty little Boy that you
<PB N="162" REF="162">have got with you? <HI>Harry,</HI> then, like the <HI>Grecian Demo&s;thenes,</HI> taking Time to warm him&s;elf with the Recollection of his own Ideas, and, &s;etting his Per&s;on forth with an Action and Ardour that determined to pre|vail, made the following Oration.</P>
<P>Why, Dada, I mu&s;t tell you as how this poor little Boy, for he is a very poor little Boy, and his Name is <HI>Neddy,</HI> Sir, and he has no Friend in the wide World but you and I, Sir; and, &s;o Sir, as I was telling you, he comes to the Door, crying &s;adly for Cold and Hunger, and he would have pitied every Body, for he had no Cloaths, nor Daddy nor Mammy at all, Sir, and I had a many of them, and that wasn't fair, you know, Sir; and I was in the Humour to give him all the Dadas and Mamas I had in the World, ex|cept you, Sir; and Mammy Nur&s;e. And &s;o, I takes him up Stairs, and I puts the Cloaths upon him, that you gave me, when I was a poor little Boy, Sir; for no Body had to &s;ay to 'em, but you and I, Sir; and I knew that you would pity poor little <HI>Neddy,</HI> more than I pitied him my|&s;elf, Sir. And &s;o, Dada, they takes my poor little <HI>Neddy</HI> to Day, and boxed him, and beat him &s;adly, and turned him out of Doors; and &s;o I meets him crying and roaring, and &s;o, you know, Sir, as how
<PB N="163" REF="163">I had nothing to do, but to bring him to you, Sir, or to &s;tay, and cry with him for Company, Sir.</P>
<P>Here, Orator <HI>Harry</HI> cea&s;ed to &s;peak, except by his Tears, which he could no longer re&s;train, and which proceeded to plead mo&s;t emphatically for him. But, his Patron took him in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed the Drops from both Eyes, and &s;aid, don't cry, my Darling, for I am yours, my <HI>Harry,</HI> and all that I have is yours, and, if you had brought a whole Regiment of poor little <HI>Neddies,</HI> with you, they &s;hould be all welcome to me, for your Sake, my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Harry</HI> &s;prung up, and caught his Patron about the Neck, &s;o that it was &s;ome Time before the old Gentleman could get loo&s;e. But, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, I am going ju&s;t now to leave this Country; will you and your Man <HI>Neddy</HI> come along with me? Over the World wide, Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry;</HI> but where are you going, Sir? I am going a Begging, <HI>Harry.</HI> O, that will be brave Sport, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> I'll tell you what you &s;hall do, Dada. What's that, my Love? Why, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> you mu&s;t get a great Bag, like the old Man and little Child that was at Door, 'tother Day. And <HI>Neddy</HI> and I will beg for you, Sir; and we will put all that we
<PB N="164" REF="164">get into your great Bag, as that good lit|tle Child did for his Daddy, without touching a Bit; though he was a hungry enough, him&s;elf, poor Fellow, I warant. But don't let us go to beg to Papa's Door, Sir; for, if you do, they will box and beat us, and drive us away, as they did to poor little <HI>Neddy,</HI> to Day, Sir.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman, thereat, had his Countenance divided betwixt the ri&s;ing Tear and the bur&s;ting Laugh. But, taking <HI>Harry</HI> by the Hand, he &s;aid. No no, my heavenly Creature, I am not going to beg of any Man living, but to beg of God to pour down his full Weight of Ble&s;&s;ings upon my <HI>Harry,</HI> and, to endea|vour to confirm them to him, both here and hereafter, by my Care and In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken, he put a large Cake into the Hand of each of the Chil|dren, and, cau&s;ing them to drink a full Gla&s;s of &s;mall White-Wine, he took them into a back Yard, where a light Coach with &s;ix Hor&s;es and three Servants, ready mounted, attended. And, having placed his young Companions, and &s;eated him&s;elf between them, away the Coach drove, at a &s;weeping Gallop.</P>
<P>About the Time that our Hero and his Patron &s;et out, Nur&s;e went up Stairs,
<PB N="165" REF="165">with a mo&s;t bountiful Cut, of Home|baked Bread and Butter; for the Amu&s;e|ment of the young Caitiff whom &s;he had left in the Clo&s;et; but not finding him there, &s;he ha&s;tily dropped her Provinder on the fir&s;t Window &s;he met, and, hurry|ing down to the Kitchen, earne&s;tly enquir|ed for the little Beggar-Boy whom Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> had taken into his Service; at this Que&s;tion all the Servants &s;tood in &s;ilent A|mazement, except <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> who, bridling up, and a&s;&s;uming the whole Importance of her Station. Why, Nur&s;e, &s;ays &s;he, you mu&s;tn't oppo&s;e that I am come here, to &s;weep and to clean after lou&s;y little Fla|grants, it was enough to breed an Anta|gion, that it was, in the Hou&s;e; &s;o what magnifies many Words, I took the little dirty Ba&s;tard and cuff'd him out of Doors. You did Hu&s;&s;ey, &s;ays Nur&s;e, you dare to affront and vex my Child, my little Man, the Honour and Pride of all the Family? And, &s;o &s;aying, &s;he ups with her brawny Arm, and gave <HI>Su&s;y</HI> &s;uch a Dou&s;e on the Side of the Head, as left her fa&s;t a&s;leep for an Hour and upward. Then running up Stairs, again, &s;he went, &s;earching and clamouring, for her <HI>Harry,</HI> about the Hou&s;e, in order to comfort and condole with him for his Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Dinner was now &s;erved up, and the Company &s;eated, and all the Servants ran
<PB N="166" REF="166">&s;everally, here and there, repeatedly &s;um|moning Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> to attend. But, <HI>Harry</HI> was out of Hearing, by many a Mile. When the Cloth was removed, Nur&s;e entered with an A&s;pect, half in Tears and half di&s;tracted, and exclaimed that her Child was not to be found. And what, Nur&s;e, &s;ays the Earl, do you think is become of him? I hope, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, that he is either &s;trayed to his Daddy, or to the dumb Gentleman's. Then, Me&s;&s;engers were, in&s;tantly, di&s;patched to both Hou&s;es, who &s;peedily returned, with Tidings, that Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> had not been &s;een at his Fo&s;ter-father's, and that no one was at Home at the Hou&s;e of the Dumb Gentleman.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s, now, became &s;erious, and alarming; the whole Hou&s;e was in Com|motion, and all the Dome&s;tics, and our Hero's loving Nur&s;e, with Lord <HI>Dickey</HI> in her Hand, ran &s;earching through the Gar|dens, the Fields, and the Groves, that re|&s;ounded, on all Sides, with the Name of the Ab&s;entee.</P>
<P>On their Return from a Di&s;qui&s;ition, as fruitle&s;s as &s;olicitous, Nur&s;e declared her Apprehen&s;ions, that <HI>Harry</HI> was gone off, with a little favourite Boy whom he had taken into Service, and whom the Hou&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="167">Maid, that Morning, had beaten out of Doors. <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> being nearly recovered, and now called and que&s;tioned, hereon, was compelled to confe&s;s the Fact, though in Terms le&s;s haughty and le&s;s elegant, than u&s;ual; when my Lord, looking &s;ternly at her, and who, you Strumpet, he cried, gave you Authority to turn any one out of my Hou&s;e whom my noble and gene|rous Boy was plea&s;ed to bring in? get you in&s;tantly away, and never let me be &s;o un|happy as to &s;ee that Face again.</P>
<P>By this Time, the whole Village and Neighbourhood, as well as this noble Fa|mily, were in Trouble and Alarms for the Lo&s;s of their little Favourite; when a Countryman enter'd in &s;weaty Ha&s;te and de&s;ired, without Preface, to be admitted to the Earl. My Lord, &s;ays he, I think I can give you &s;ome News of your dear Child. As I was returning Home on the <HI>London</HI> Road, I &s;aw a Coach and Six driv|ing towards me at a great rate, and, though it pa&s;&s;ed me in Ha&s;te, I marked that the Gentleman with the Beard, was in it, and that he had two Children with him, one on each Hand, though I had not Time to ob&s;erve their Faces.</P>
<P>Here is &s;omething for your News, &s;aid the Earl, it may be as you &s;ay.&mdash;Here, <HI>John!</HI> take a Po&s;&s;e of the Servants along
<PB N="168" REF="168">with you. Go in Ha&s;te to that Man's Hou&s;e. If no one an&s;wers, break open the Door; and bring me Word of what you can learn concerning him.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> who was the Hou&s;e Steward, hurried in&s;tantly on his Commi&s;&s;ion; and, finding all in Silence, after loud and re|peated Knockings, he and his Myrmidons bur&s;t open the Door, and ru&s;hing in ran up and down through all the Apartments. They found the Hou&s;e richly furni&s;hed, a Library of choice Books above Stairs, a Buffet full of ma&s;&s;y Plate, and every Thing in Order as if prepared for the Re|ception of a Family of Di&s;tinction. At this they all &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, till <HI>John,</HI> ca&s;ting his Eye toward a Table in the Street Parlour, perceived a Paper which he ha&s;tily &s;natched up, and found to be a Letter, duely folded and &s;ealed and ad|dre&s;&s;ed to his Lord. Exulting at this Di&s;|covery, he left &s;ome of the Servants to watch the Goods, and hurried back with all po&s;&s;ible Speed to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays <HI>John</HI> entring, and &s;triv|ing to recover Breath, the dumb Gentle|man, as they call him, mu&s;t be a main rich Man, for the very Furniture of his Hou&s;e cannot be worth le&s;s than &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Pounds. <HI>John</HI> then pre|&s;ented
<PB N="169" REF="169">the Letter, which the Earl ha&s;tily broke open, and found to be, as follows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>I Am at length pre&s;ented with an Op|portunity of carrying off your little <HI>Harry,</HI> the greate&s;t Trea&s;ure that ever Parents were ble&s;s'd with.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tre&s;s that I feel, in fore&s;eeing the Affliction that his Ab&s;ence will cau&s;e to your whole Family, has not been able to prevail for the Su&s;pen&s;ion of this Enterprize, as the Child's Intere&s;t and Happine&s;s outweighs, with me, all o|ther Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Permit me, however, to a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip that our Darling is in very &s;afe and very affectionate Hands, and that it &s;hall be the whole Concern, and Employment of my Life, to render and to return him to you, in due Time, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and mo&s;t perfect of all human Beings.</P>
<P>In the mean while, your utmo&s;t Search and Enquiry after us will be fruitle&s;s. I leave to your Lord&s;hip my Hou&s;e and Furniture, as a Pledge and

<P>The My&s;tery of our Hero's Flight was now, in a great Mea&s;ure unravelled; but no one could form any rational Conjecture, touching the Motive of the old Gentle|man's Procedure in the Ca&s;e; and all were &s;taggered at his leaving &s;uch a Ma&s;s of Wealth behind him.</P>
<P>As the falling on of a dark Night ren|dered all Pur&s;uit, for that Time, imprac|ticable; my Lord order'd the Servants to Bed, that they might ri&s;e before Day; and then to take every Hor&s;e he had, Coach-Cattle and all, and to mu&s;ter and mount the young Men of the Village, and to pur&s;ue after the Fugitives, by different Roads, according to the be&s;t Likelihood or Intelligence they might receive.</P>
<P>In this hopeful Pro&s;pect, the Hou&s;e was again in &s;ome Mea&s;ure compo&s;ed; all, ex|cept poor Nur&s;e who would not be com|forted, neither could be prevailed upon to enter in at the Doors; but all Night, on the cold Stairs, or rambling through the raw Air, continued clapping and wringing
<PB N="171" REF="171">her Hands, and bewailing the irreparable Lo&s;s of her <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>On the following Day, my Lord or|dered a minute Inventory to be taken of all the Furniture in the for&s;aken Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e; and further appointed <HI>Harry</HI>'s Fo&s;|ter-father, with his Family, to enter into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to take Care of the Effects, till &s;uch Time as the Proprietor &s;hould re|new his Claim.</P>
<P>After three tedious Days, and as many expecting Nights, the Po&s;&s;e that went in que&s;t of our Runaways returned; all, drooping and dejected, mo&s;t of them &s;low|ly leading their over&s;pent Hor&s;es, and uni|ver&s;ally be&s;patter'd or cover'd with Mire, without any Equivalent of comfortable Ti|dings to balance the Weight of their Lan|gour and Fatigue.</P>
<P>The Happine&s;s or Wretchedne&s;s of hu|man Life, as it &s;hould &s;eem, does not &s;o much depend on the Lo&s;s or Acqui&s;ition of real Advantage, as on the fluctuating Opinions and Imaginations of Men. The Ab&s;ence of this Infant who, but a few Months before, had no Manner of Intere&s;t in the Views, Affections, or Solicitudes of this noble Family, appeared now as the Lo&s;s of all their Honours and Fortunes. A general Face of Mourning &s;eemed to dar|ken
<PB N="172" REF="172">every Apartment; and my Lord and Lady no more paid Vi&s;its, nor received public Company. They were however inventive in many Contrivances for amu|&s;ing and con&s;oling their darling <HI>Dickey,</HI> but even this was to little Purpo&s;e, for he was often found &s;ilently langui&s;hing in Corners; or crying, O, where's my Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> my own &s;weet Brother <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;hall I never &s;ee my own Brother <HI>Harry</HI> any more?</P>
<P>My Lord had already di&s;patched a Mul|titude of circular Letters to all his Ac|quaintances, with other Notices, through|out the Kingdom, containing Offers of ample Rewards for the Recovery of his Child. But, finding all ineffectual, he cau&s;ed Adverti&s;ements, to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e, to be repeatedly in&s;erted in all the public Papers; as the &s;ame, no doubt, are &s;till extant, and may be found in the mu&s;ty Chronicles of tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>Within a few Weeks after the publi&s;h|ing of the&s;e Adverti&s;ements my Lord re|ceived a Letter, re&s;pecting his Son <HI>Harry,</HI> that afforded great Con&s;olation to him and his Lady; in&s;omuch, that, with the Help of the lenient Hand of Time, in le&s;s than the Space of twelve Months, this noble Family were re&s;tored to their former Chearfulne&s;s and Tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="173">
But, to return to the Situation in which we left our Hero: The Coach drove on, at a round Rate, and the Children conti|nued in high Glee, and thought this kind of Conveyance the fine&s;t Sport imaginable.</P>
<P>When they had entered, a Space, on the fir&s;t Common, the Coachman looked about, to take Care that no one was in Sight; and, turning to the right Hand, he held gently on, till he came to another great Road, on which he drove at his former Rate. This he did, again, at the next Common, and, coming to another Road that led, al&s;o, to <HI>London,</HI> and Night now approaching, he put up at the fir&s;t great Inn he came to.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI>'s Patron had the Precaution to keep his great Coat muffled about his Face, &s;o that no one could ob&s;erve his Beard, till they were &s;hewn to a Room, and Fire and Candles were lighted up. Then, his ancient Friend and Dome&s;tic, having provided Sci&s;&s;ars and Implements for Shaving, locked the Door and &s;et to Work in the Pre&s;ence of the Children.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> was all Attention, during the whole Proce&s;s; and when the Operation was quite compleated, he drew near to his Patron, with a cautious kind of Jealou&s;y,
<PB N="174" REF="174">and, looking up to his Face, with the Tears in his little Eyes, &s;peak to me, Sir, &s;ays he, pray &s;peak to me. It is, an&s;wer|ed the old Gentleman, the only Comfort of my Life to be with you and to &s;peak to you, my <HI>Harry.</HI> The Child, hearing the well known Voice of Friend&s;hip, im|mediately cleared again, and, reaching up his little Arms to embrace his Patron; O, indeed, &s;ays he, I believe you are my own Dada &s;till.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Harry</HI> was, now, reconciled to the Identity of his Friend, yet he felt a &s;e|cret Regret for the Ab&s;ence of his Beard. For he loved all and every Part, of him, &s;o entirely, that the Lo&s;s of a Hair ap|peared a Lo&s;s and a Want to the Heart of <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>After an early Supper, and two or three &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es of Wine <HI>per</HI> Man; this Gen|tleman, whom his Servants had now an|nounced by the Name of Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> be|came all Things in all with his young Companions. He delighted them with &s;e|veral entertaining Tricks. He put the Point of a large Needle to the Edge of a drinking Gla&s;s, and then, placing the Centre of a Pewter Plate on the Top of the Needle, he began to turn it about, with an encrea&s;ing Motion, till it whirled round, at a Rapidity that was altogether
<PB N="175" REF="175">joyous and amazing to the little Spectators. He, next, turned two Plates with their Faces to each-other, and, placing them on the Brim of a large Beer-Gla&s;s, he put an Egg upon the Plates, and, giving the Plates a &s;light Stroke, with the Side of his Hand, the Plates, in&s;tantly flew from between the Gla&s;s and the Egg, and the Egg fell plumb into the Gla&s;s, without the &s;malle&s;t Fracture.</P>
<P>After &s;ome other of the like Fooleries, the Table was removed; and, as the Room was very large, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> propo&s;ed <HI>Hide and go &s;eek</HI> to his A&s;&s;ociates. This Invitation was accepted with Tran&s;port, and, after they were cloy'd with <HI>Hide and &s;eek,</HI> they all play'd <HI>Tagg</HI> till they were well warmed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> then ordered a Pallet into the Chamber, for <HI>James,</HI> his faithful Do|me&s;tic, and little <HI>Ned.</HI> Then, helping to undre&s;s <HI>Harry,</HI> he put him, fir&s;t, to Bed; and, ha&s;tening after, he took his Darling to his Bo&s;om, and tenderly pre&s;&s;ed him to a Heart that loved him more than all the World, and more than that World ten times told.</P>
<P>In about three Days more, they arriv|ed &s;afe, at <HI>Ham&s;ted,</HI> and &s;topping at the Court of a large Hou&s;e, that was delight|fully &s;ituated, they were welcomed by a
<PB N="176" REF="176">Gentlewomanly looking Matron, whom <HI>James</HI> had fixed for Hou&s;ekeeper, about a Fortnight before.</P>
<P>The next Day, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and his blithe Companions were attended at Table by <HI>James</HI> and the two Footmen.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the latter Grace was &s;aid, and the Cloth taken away; <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> it is now our turn to wait on <HI>James</HI> and his Fellow Servants. For <HI>God</HI> made us all to be Servants to each other, and one Man is not born a Bit better than another, and he is the be&s;t and greate&s;t of all who &s;erves and attends the mo&s;t, and requires lea&s;t to be &s;erved and attended upon. And, my Precious, he, that is a King to Day, if &s;o it &s;hall plea&s;e <HI>God,</HI> may become a Beggar To-morrow, and it is good that People &s;hould be prepared a|gain&s;t all that may happen.</P>
<P>Having &s;o &s;aid, he took his A&s;&s;ociates down to the Hall, ju&s;t as the Servants had &s;at down to Dinner. He gave his Dome&s;|tics the Wink, and, beginning to &s;et the Example, a&s;ked Mrs. <HI>Hannah,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Frank,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> what they would plea&s;e to have? The Servants, readily falling in with their Ma&s;|ter's Scheme, ordered <HI>Harry</HI> to bring &s;uch a Thing, and <HI>Ned</HI> to fetch &s;uch a Thing,
<PB N="177" REF="177">and <HI>Harry</HI> to do this, and <HI>Harry</HI> to do that. While <HI>Harry,</HI> with a graceful Action, and more beautiful than <HI>Ganymede</HI> the Cup-Bearer of the Gods, flew chearfully about, from Side to Side, preventing the Wi&s;hes of all at Table; &s;o that they poured upon him a thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings from the Bottom of their Hearts, and, would now &s;carce have parted with him for the mighty Re|wards, which his Father, &s;ome Time af|ter, propo&s;ed for his Recovery.</P>
<P>Within a Fortnight after this, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> the Hou&s;e Steward, had furni&s;h|ed a large Lumber-Room with thou&s;ands of Coats, out-Coats, Shirts, Wai&s;tcoats, Breeches, Stockings, and Shoes, of diffe|rent Sorts and Sizes, but all of warm and clean, though homely Materials.</P>
<P>When this was done, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> led his Favourite up to the Stores, and &s;aid; my <HI>Harry,</HI> you &s;ee all the&s;e Things, and I make a Pre&s;ent of all the&s;e Things to my <HI>Harry.</HI> And, now tell me, my Love, what will you do with them? Why, Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> you know that I can't wear them my&s;elf. No, my Dear, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> for, you have Clothes enough be|&s;ide, and &s;ome of them would not fit you, and others would &s;mother you. What then will you do with them, will you burn
<PB N="178" REF="178">them, or throw them away? O, that would be very naughty and wicked indeed, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> No, Dada, as I don't want 'em, my&s;elf, I will give 'em, to tho&s;e that do. That will be very hone&s;tly done of you, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> for, in Truth they have a better Right to them, my <HI>Harry,</HI> than you have, and that, which you can|not u&s;e, cannot belong to you. So that, in giving you the&s;e Things, my Darling, it &s;hould &s;eem, as if I made you no Gift at all. O, a very &s;weet Gift, &s;ays <HI>Harry.</HI> How is that, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> why, the Gift of doing Good to poor People, Sir. Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> then, &s;tepping back, and, gaz|ing on our Hero, cryed; whoever attempts to in&s;truct thee, my Angel, mu&s;t, him&s;elf, be in&s;tructed of Heaven, who &s;peaks by that &s;weet Mouth.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Harry,</HI> it would not be di&s;creet of you to give the&s;e Things to the common Beggars who come every Day to our Door; give them Victuals and Half-Pence or Pence a-piece, and welcome. But, if you give &s;uch Beggars twenty Suits of Clothes, they will ca&s;t them all off, and put on their Raggs, again, to move Peo|ple to pity them. But, when you &s;py any poor Travellers going the Road, and, that your Eye-&s;ees that they are naked, or your Heart tells you that they are hun|gry; then, do not wait till they beg of
<PB N="179" REF="179">you, but go and beg of them to favour you with their Acceptance; then take them in, to the Fire, and warm them, and feed them; and, when you have &s;o done, take them up to your Store-Room, and cloath them with whatever you think they want. And, believe me, my <HI>Harry,</HI> when|ever you are cold, or hungry, or wounded, or in want, or in Sickne&s;s, your&s;elf; the very Remembrance of your having cloathed, and fed, and cured, and comforted, the naked and the hungry, the wounded, and the afflicted, will be Warmth, and Food, and Medicine, and Balm to your own Mind.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;poke, the Mu&s;cles of <HI>Harry</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ive Countenance, like an equally tuned In&s;trument, uttered Uni&s;ons to every Word he heard.</P>
<P>From this Day forward, <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Ned,</HI> by Turns, were frequently out on the Watch; and, often &s;ingle, or in Pairs, or by whole Families, <HI>Harry</HI> would take in a poor Father and Mother, with their help|le&s;s Infants, driven perhaps from Hou&s;e and Home, by Fire, or other Misfortune, or oppre&s;&s;ive Landlord, or ruthle&s;s Credi|tor; and, having warmed, and fed, and cloathed, and treated the Old-Ones as his Parents, and the Little-Ones as his Bro|thers and Si&s;ters, he would give them ad|ditional Money, for Charges on the Road,
<PB N="180" REF="180">and &s;end them away the happie&s;t of all People except him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By this Time, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had inquired into the Circum&s;tances and Characters of all the Poor in the Town and throughout the Precincts, and, having refuted or con|firmed the Intelligence he had received, by a per&s;onal In&s;pection and Vi&s;it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and, having made Entries of all &s;uch, as he deemed real Objects and wor|thy of his Benificence, he invited the Heads of the &s;everal Families to take a Dinner with him, every <HI>Sunday,</HI> at his Hall.</P>
<P>On the following <HI>Sunday,</HI> there came a|bout thirty of the&s;e Vi&s;itants, which Num|ber &s;oon encrea&s;ed to fifty weekly Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>On entring, they found the Cloth ready &s;pread, and Mr. <HI>James,</HI> having counted Heads, laid a Crown, in Silver, upon e|very Plate; which fir&s;t Cour&s;e was a mo&s;t reli&s;hing Sauce to all that followed. A plentiful Dinner was then introduced, and, the Gue&s;ts being &s;eated, Mr. <HI>Fenton, Harry, Ned,</HI> and the four Dome&s;tics at|tended, and di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves, in a Manner the mo&s;t ready to &s;upply the Wants of the Company. The Gue&s;ts, all aba&s;hed and confounded at what they &s;aw, &s;at, &s;ome Time, with open Mouth, and
<PB N="181" REF="181">un&s;wallowed Victuals, much le&s;s did they pre&s;ume to apply to the Waiters for any Article they wanted; till, being encou|raged and &s;pirited up, by the Chearful|ne&s;s, Ea&s;e, and Readine&s;s of their Atten|dants, they became, by Degrees, quite happy and jovial; and, after a &s;aturating Meal, and an enlivening Cup, they de|parted, with elevated Spirits, with huma|nized Manners, and with Hearts warmed, in Affection, toward ev'ry Member of this extraordinary Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>By the means of this weekly Bounty, the&s;e reviving Families were &s;oon enabled to clear their little Debts, to the Chand|lers, which had compelled them to take up every Thing at the deare&s;t Hand. They, were, al&s;o, further enabled to pur|cha&s;e Wheels and other Implements, with the Materials of Flax and Wool, for employing the late idle Hands of their Hou&s;hold. They, now, appeared decent|ly clad, and with happy Countenances. Their Wealth encrea&s;ed with their Indu&s;|try. And the Product of the Employment of &s;o many late u&s;ele&s;s Members became a real Acce&s;&s;ion of Wealth to the Public. So true it is, that the Pro&s;perity of this World, and, of every Nation and Society, therein, depends, &s;oley, on the Indu&s;try or Manufactures of the Individuals. And, &s;o much more nobly did this private Patron
<PB N="182" REF="182">act, than all ancient Legi&s;lators, or mo|dern Patriots, and Landlords; who&s;e Selfi&s;hne&s;s, if they had but common Cun|ning, or common Sen&s;e, might in&s;truct them to encrea&s;e their proper Rents, and enrich their native Country, by &s;upplying the Hands of all the Poor, within their In|fluence, with the Implements and Materi|als of the Pro&s;perity of each.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Mrs. <HI>Hannah,</HI> daily, in&s;tructed the Children in the Reading of <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Neither was Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> inatten|tive to any Means that might pre&s;erve and promote the Health, Action, and corporal Excellencies of his little Champion.</P>
<P>He held a large Lawn, behind his Gar|den: and, hither he &s;ummoned, three Times in every Week, all the Boys of the Vicinage, that were within two Years, advanced above the Age of our Hero. To the&s;e he appointed Premiums for Football, Hurling, Wre&s;tling, Leaping, Running, Cudgelling, and Buffing. But the Champi|ons were enjoined to inve&s;t their Fi&s;ts with little Mufflers, in&s;omuch, that, how great &s;oever their Vigour might be, the Brui&s;es that they gave &s;topped &s;hort of Mortality.</P>
<P>Now, though the&s;e Premiums were, al|mo&s;t, univer&s;ally adjudged to the Party of which <HI>Harry</HI> then happened to be a Mem|ber,
<PB N="183" REF="183">or, individually, to him&s;elf for his &s;ingle Prowe&s;s and Preeminence. Yet, he never would con&s;ent to bear the Prize from the Field; but, either gave it to &s;ome Fa|vourite among tho&s;e, with whom he had been a&s;&s;ociated; or to the particular Champion whom he had wor&s;ted in Con|te&s;t. For he felt the Shame and Defeat of his mortified Adver&s;ary, and con&s;olingly hinted at the Inju&s;tice of the Judges, and reformed their Error, by the Re&s;toration of the Reward.</P>
<P>One Day, while <HI>Harry</HI> was watching to intercept poor Travellers, as eagerly as a Fowler watches for the ri&s;ing of his Game; he heard a plaintive Voice, behind the Hedge, as he thought, in the oppo|&s;ite Field. He flew acro&s;s the Road, and, pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;mall Turn&s;tile &s;oon found the unhappy Objects he &s;ought for. He &s;tood, for &s;ome Time, like a Statue, and his Compa&s;&s;ion became too &s;trong for Tears or Utterance: but, &s;uddenly turn|ing, and flying back again, he ru&s;hed, with Precipitation, into the Room where Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was writing a Letter. What is the Matter, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;tarting, what has frighted you, my <HI>Harry,</HI> what makes you look &s;o pale? To this <HI>Harry</HI> replied not, but catching hold of his Hand, and pulling, with all his Force, O come, &s;ays he, O come, Dada, and &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="184">
Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> then got up, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led where the Child plea&s;ed to conduct him, without another Word being a&s;ked or an&s;wered on either Side.</P>
<P>When they were come into the Field, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ob&s;erv'd a Man &s;itting on the Ground. His Clothes &s;eemed, from Head to Foot, as the tattered Remainder of bet|ter Days. Through a &s;qualid Wig, and Beard, his pale Face appeared ju&s;t tinctured with a faint and &s;ickly Red. And, his hollow Eyes were fixed upon the Face of a Woman, who&s;e Head he held on his Knees; and, who looked to be dead, or dying, though without any apparent Ago|ny; while a male Infant, about four Years of Age, was half &s;tretched on the Ground, and half acro&s;s the Woman's Lap, with its little No&s;e pinched by Famine, and its Eyes &s;taring about, wildly, though without Attention to any Thing. Di&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed to have expended its utmo&s;t Bit|terne&s;s on the&s;e Objects, and the la&s;t Sigh and Tear to have been, already, exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Unhappy Man, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> pray, who or what are you? to which the Stran|ger, faintly, replied; without lifting his Eyes. Whoever you may be, di&s;turb not the la&s;t Hour of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be at Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="185">
Run, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> de&s;ire all the Servants to come to me, immediately; and bid Mrs. <HI>Hannah</HI> bring &s;ome Hart&s;horn and a Bottle of Cordial.</P>
<P>Away flew <HI>Harry,</HI> like feathered <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> on his Godlike Errand. Forth i&s;&s;ued Mr. <HI>James, Frank,</HI> and <HI>Andrew.</HI> And la&s;t came Mrs. <HI>Hannah,</HI> with the Hou&s;e-Maid and Cordials.</P>
<P><HI>Hannah</HI> &s;tooped, in Ha&s;te, and applied Hart&s;horn to the No&s;e of the Woman, who appeared wholly in&s;en&s;ible. After &s;ome Time, her Bo&s;om heaved with a long-ri&s;ing and &s;ub&s;iding Sigh, and her Eyes feebly opened, and immediately clo&s;ed, again. Then <HI>Hannah</HI> and the Hou&s;e-Maid, rai&s;ing her gently between them, got a little of the Cordial into her Mouth, and bending her, backward, they ob&s;erv'd that &s;he &s;wallowed it. Then <HI>James, Frank, Andrew,</HI> and the Hou&s;e-Maid, joining their Forces, lifted her up, and bore her, as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, toward the Hou&s;e. While <HI>Harry</HI> caught up her Infant, as a Pi&s;&s;mire does its favourite Embryo, in a Time of Di&s;tre&s;s, in order to lodge it in a Place of Protection and Safety.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="186">
In the mean Time Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Hannah</HI> put their Hart&s;horn, with great Tenderne&s;s, to the No&s;trils of the Stran|ger, and reque&s;ted him to take a Sup of the Cordial. But, he, turning up his dim, though expre&s;&s;ive Eyes, feebly cried, are you a Man or an Angel? and directly faint|ed away.</P>
<P>They rubbed his Temples, with the Spirits, and did their utmo&s;t to recover him, but a &s;udden Gu&s;t of grateful Pa&s;|&s;ion had proved too &s;trong for his Con|&s;titution. On the Return of the Servants he was, al&s;o, carried in. A Phy&s;ician was, in&s;tantly, &s;ent for; Beds were provided and warmed, in ha&s;te; the new Gue&s;ts were all, gently, undre&s;t and laid therein; and, being compelled to &s;wallow a little Sack Whey, they recovered to a kind of languid Sen&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;ician gave it, as his Opinion, that this unhappy Family were reduced to their pre&s;ent State, by Exce&s;s of Grief and Famine. That Nouri&s;hment &s;hould be ad|mini&s;tered, in very &s;mall Proportions. And, that they &s;hould be kept as quiet, as po&s;&s;ible, for a Fortnight at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>Sir, you never were more mi&s;|taken. I know nothing at all of the&s;e People's Affairs. As &s;oon as they are able they will &s;peak for them&s;elves. I know of no Advantage that they can get by their Silence, whatever they may derive from your Compa&s;&s;ion and Genero&s;ity by telling their Ca&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a Month before this, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had engaged one Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> the Schoolma&s;ter of the Town, to come, for an Hour every Evening, and initiate the two Boys in their <HI>Latin</HI> Grammar. But, he had a &s;pecial Caution given him, with re&s;pect to the generous Di&s;po&s;ition of our Hero, which was &s;aid to be induced to do any Thing, by Kindne&s;s; but to be hardened and rouzed into Oppo&s;ition by Severity.</P>
<P>In about ten Days after the late Ad|venture, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was called to <HI>London,</HI> where he was detained, about three Weeks, in &s;ettling his Books with his <HI>Dutch</HI>-Cor|re&s;pondents; and in calling in a very large Arrear of Intere&s;t, that was due to him upon his Depo&s;its in the Funds.</P>
<P>During his Ab&s;ence, Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> began to a&s;&s;ume a more expanded Authority, and gave a freer Scope to the &s;urly Ter|rors of his Station.</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> was, by Nature, a very lively, but very petulant Boy; and when <HI>Vindex,</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="189">reproved him with the imperial Brow and Voice of the great Mogul, <HI>Ned,</HI> ca&s;t upon him an Eye of &s;uch &s;ignificant Contempt, as no Submi&s;&s;ions or Sufferings, on the Part of the Offender, could ever after com|pen&s;ate.</P>
<P>The next Day, Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> returned, doubly armed, with a mon&s;trous birch Rod, in one Hand, and a Ferule in the other. The fir&s;t he hung up, in Terro|rem, as a Meteor is &s;aid to hang in the Heavens, threatening future Ca&s;tigation to the Children of Men. The &s;econd he held, as determined upon pre&s;ent Action; nor was he unmindful of any Hook, whereon to hang a Fault; &s;o that, travelling from Right to Left, and from Left to Right, he &s;o warmed the Hands of the unfortunate <HI>Edward,</HI> as ruined the funny Oeconomy of his Countenance, and reduced him to a di&s;agreeable Partner&s;hip with the Afflicted.</P>
<P>On the Departure of <HI>Vindex,</HI> though <HI>Ned</HI>'s Drollery was di&s;mayed, his Re&s;ent|ment was, by no Means, eradicated. For the Principle of <HI>Ned</HI> was wholly agreeable to the Motto of a very noble E&s;cutcheon, and, <HI>Nemo me impune lace&s;&s;it,</HI> was a Maxim, of who&s;e Impropriety not Saint <HI>Anthony,</HI> him&s;elf, could per&s;uade him.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="190">
All Night he lay ruminating, and brood|ing on Mi&s;chief in his Imagination, and, having formed the Outlines of his Plan to|ward Morning, he began to chuckle, and comfort him&s;elf, and exult in the Execu|tion. He, then, revealed his Project to his Bedfellow, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> who was greatly tickled therewith, and promi&s;ed to join in the Plot.</P>
<P>Full again&s;t the Portal, that opened up|on the School-Room, there &s;tood an anci|ent and elevated Chair, who&s;e Form was &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of its Importance. Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> had &s;elected this maje&s;tic Piece of Furniture as, alone, &s;uitable to the Dig|nity of his exalted Station. For he judici|ou&s;ly con&s;idered that, if <HI>Thrones</HI> and <HI>Benches</HI> were taken from among Men, there would be an End of all Dominion and Ju&s;tice up|on Earth.</P>
<P>Through the Centre of the Seat, of this Chair of Authority, <HI>Ned</HI> got Mr. <HI>James</HI> to drill a &s;mall Hole, not di&s;cernible, ex|cept on a very minute Scrutiny. He then provided a cylindrial Stick of about &s;ix Inches in length, to one End of which he fa&s;tened a Piece of Lead, and, in the other End he fixed the Head of a large Needle. This Needle had been a Glover's, of ap|proved
<PB N="191" REF="191">Mettle, keen, and poli&s;hed, and three-&s;quare, toward the Point, for a quick and ready Penetration of tough Leather. He, next, fa&s;tened two &s;mall Chords, tran&s;ver&s;ly, to the leaden Extremity of the Stick, and, <HI>James</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting, they turned the Chair with the Bottom upward, and tacked the four Ends of the Chords, in &s;uch a manner, as an&s;wered to the four Cardinal Points of the Compa&s;s; while the Stick remained &s;u&s;pended in an upright Direction, with the Point of the Needle ju&s;t, &s;o far, through the Drill, as put it upon a Level with the Surface of the Seat. La&s;tly, they fa&s;tened a long, and well waxed, Thread about the Middle of the Stick, and, drawing this Thread over the upper Rung, they dropped the End of it, ju&s;t under <HI>Ned</HI>'s Stool; and replaced the Seat of Learning in its former Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Greatly did <HI>Ned</HI> parade it, when, on Trial, he found that his Machine an&s;wer|ed to a Miracle; for, the Stick being re|&s;trained from any Motion, &s;ave that in a Direction to the Zenith; on the &s;lighte&s;t Twitch of the Thread, the Needle, in|&s;tantly, mounted four Sixths of two Inches above the Surface of the Seat, and was, as quickly, recalled by the Revul&s;ion of the Lead.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="192">
At the appointed Hour of Magi&s;terial Approach, in comes Mr. <HI>Vindex.</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> and <HI>Ned</HI> are called. Each &s;eizes his Book; and takes his Seat as u&s;ual in a Line nearly, diagonal to the right and left Corner of the Chair of Authority. Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> a&s;&s;umes the Chair. But, &s;carce was he down, when <HI>Ned</HI> gives the pre|meditated Intimation to his Piercer, and up bounces <HI>Vindex,</HI> and gives two or three Capers, as though he had been &s;uddenly &s;tung by a Tarantula. He &s;tares wildly about; puts his Hand behind him, with a Touch of tender Condolance; returns to the Chair; peers all over it with Eyes of the mo&s;t prying In&s;pection; but, not tru&s;t|ing to the Te&s;timony of his occular Sen&s;e, in a Ca&s;e that, &s;o very feelingly, refuted its Evidence, he moved his Fingers over and over every Part of the Surface; but found all &s;mooth and fair, in Spight of the late &s;en&s;ible Demon&s;tration to the contrary.</P>
<P>Down again, with &s;low Caution, &s;ub&s;id|ed Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> reconnoitring the Premi&s;&s;es, to the right Hand, and to the left.</P>
<P>As his Temper was not, now, in the mo&s;t duleet Di&s;po&s;ition; he, fir&s;t, looked &s;ternly at <HI>Ned,</HI> and, then turning toward <HI>Harry,</HI> with an Eye that &s;ought Occa&s;ion for pre&s;ent Quarrel, he que&s;tioned him,
<PB N="193" REF="193">moro&s;ely, on &s;ome Articles of his Le&s;&s;on. When <HI>Ned,</HI> not enduring &s;uch an Indig|nity to the Patron of his Life and Fortunes, gave a &s;econd Twitch, with better Will, and much more lively than at fir&s;t; and up, again, &s;prung <HI>Vindex,</HI> with redoubled Vigour and Action, and bounded, plung|ed, and pranced about the Room, as be|witch'd. He glared, and &s;earched all a|bout, with a frantic Penetration, and por|ed into every Corner for the vi&s;ible or in|vi&s;ible Perpetrators of the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs. He, now, began to imagine that &s;ome Devil wanted a Pincu&s;hion, and propo&s;ed no o|ther, for the Purpo&s;e, than his capacious Material.</P>
<P>In this Thought, he retreated to the next Chamber, &s;tripped off his Clothes, his Shoes, and Breeches, and, to know whe|ther a Lodgment had been duely made; he groped for the Heads of the &s;uppo&s;ed Weapons. He next &s;earched his Breeches, and every Skirt and po&s;terior Fold of Coat and Wai&s;tcoat. But, finding the Coa&s;ts clear of any En&s;igns of Ho&s;tility, he writhed and twi&s;ted his Head and Eyes to this Side and to that to di&s;cern, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the Deva&s;tations that had been made in the Field of Honour; when, hearing a little Titter in the neighbouring School Room, he began to &s;mell a Fox, and, dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf again, with a malignant
<PB N="194" REF="194">Determination of better Note for the Fu|ture, he returned with a Countenance of di&s;&s;embled Placability, and, re&s;uming his Chair, began to examine the Boys, with a Voice apparently tuned by good-Temper and Affection.</P>
<P>During this &s;hort Serene, poor <HI>Ned</HI> hap|pened to make a little Trip in his Rudi|ments; when <HI>Vindex</HI> turned, and cried, to our Hero, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> my Dear, be &s;o kind to get up and reach me you Ferrule.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words had not fully pa&s;&s;ed the Lips of the luckle&s;s Pedagogue, when <HI>Ned</HI> plucked the String with his utmo&s;t Force, and <HI>Vindex</HI> thought him&s;elf, at lea&s;t, im|paled on the Spot. Up he &s;hot, once more, like a &s;udden Pyramid of Flame. The Ground could no longer retain him, he &s;oared aloft, roared, raved, cur&s;ed, and &s;wore, like a thou&s;and Infernals. While <HI>Ned,</HI> with an A&s;pect of the mo&s;t condoling Hypocricy, and Words, broke by a Tone of Mourning, tenderly inquired of his Ail|ments.</P>
<P><HI>Vindex</HI> turned upon him an Eye of jea|lous Malignity, and taking a &s;udden Thought, he flew to the Scene of his re|peated Infliction, and, turning up the Bottom of the Seat of Pain, this compli|cated Effort of extraordinary Genius lay
<PB N="195" REF="195">revealed, and expo&s;ed to vulgar Contem|plation.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t examined, minutely, into the Parts and Con&s;truction of this wonderful Machinery, who&s;e Efficacy he &s;till, &s;o feel|ingly, recollected. He then, drew the String; and admired, with what a pier|cing Agility the Needle could be actuated by &s;o di&s;tant a Hand. And, la&s;tly, and deliberately, he tore away, Piece by Piece, the whole Compo&s;ition, as his ra&s;cally Bre|thren, the <HI>Turks,</HI> have al&s;o done, in their Antipathy to all the Monuments of Arts, Genius, and Learning throughout the Earth.</P>
<P>In the mean while, our Friend <HI>Edward</HI> &s;at trembling and frying in his Skin. All his Drollery had for&s;aken him; nor had he a &s;ingle Ca&s;t of Contrivance, for evading the Mountain of Mi&s;chiefs that he &s;aw im|pending. How indeed could he palliate? what had he to hope or plead in mitigati|on of the Penalty? where, in the Party, &s;o highly offended, he &s;aw his Judge and his Executioner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> had now the Ball wholly at his own Foot, and, that <HI>Ned</HI> was ever to have his Turn again, was a Matter no way promi&s;ed by pre&s;ent Appearances.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="196">
<HI>Vindex,</HI> at length, looked &s;milingly a|bout him, with much Fun in his Face, but more Vengeance at his Heart. Mr. <HI>Ed|ward,</HI> &s;aid he, perhaps you are not yet ap|prized of the Ju&s;tice of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Laws, that claim an Eye for an Eye, and a Breech for a Breech; but I, my Child, will fully in&s;truct you in the Fitne&s;s and Pro|priety of them.</P>
<P>Then, reaching at the Rod, he &s;eized his &s;hrinking Prey, as a Kite tru&s;&s;es a Robin; he laid him, like a little Sack a|cro&s;s his own Stool, off go the Breeches, and, with the left Hand he holds him down, while the Right is laid at him with the Application of a Woodman who re|&s;olves to clear Part of the Fore&s;t before Noon.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> who was no way privy to the Machination of the Needle, now approach|ed, and interpo&s;ed in behalf of his unhap|py Servant. He petitioned, he kneeled, he wept; but his Prayers and Tears were ca&s;t to the Winds and the Rocks, till <HI>Vindex</HI> had reduced the Po&s;teriors of poor <HI>Ned,</HI> to a Plight little different from tho&s;e of Saint <HI>Bartholemew.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> ju&s;tly deemed that he had, now, given a Le&s;&s;on, of &s;uch ample In|&s;truction,
<PB N="197" REF="197">as might di&s;pen&s;e with his Pre|&s;ence for &s;ome Days at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Scalping of <HI>Ned</HI>'s Bottom held him confined to his Bed, where he had full Time, and Lei&s;ure, to contrive, with one End, a ju&s;t and wor|thy Retribution for the Sufferings of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> went, often, to &s;it, and condole with <HI>Ned</HI> in this the Sea&s;on of his Calimi|ty; and, as he had, now, conceived a &s;trong Aver&s;ion to the Pedagogue, on Ac|count of his Barbarity; he offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Friend in any Mea&s;ures deemed ade|quate to the Stripes and Injuries he had received.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> was a large and old-fa&s;hioned Building, with a &s;teep Flight of Stone-Stairs, and a &s;pacious Landing-place before the Door. <HI>Ned</HI> was again on his Legs, the Night was exce&s;&s;ive dark, and the Family of the Preceptor had ju&s;t fini&s;hed an early Supper.</P>
<P>About this Time, a gentle Rapping was heard, and a Servant, opening the Door, looked this Way, and that Way, and called out repeatedly, to know who was there; but, no Voice replying, he retired and &s;hut all to again. Scarce was he

<PB N="198" REF="200">re-enter'd when he hears Rap, rap, rap, rap. The Fellow's Anger was now kindled, and, opening the Door &s;uddenly, he bounced out at once, in order to &s;eize the Run-away. But, &s;eeing no Creature, he began to feel a coming Chilne&s;s, and his Hairs to &s;tir, as tho' each had got the Life of an Eel. Back he &s;lunk, clo&s;ed the Door with the greate&s;t Tenderne&s;s, and crept down to reveal a Scantling of his Fears to his Fellows in the Kitchen.</P>
<P>Now, though Men and Maids laugh'd, heartily, at the Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Hodge;</HI> they yet re&s;ented this In&s;ult on their Hou&s;e, as they called it, and, getting all up to|gether in a Group, they &s;lily, crouded be|hind the Door, with the Latch in one of their Hands, ready to i&s;&s;ue, in an In&s;tant, and detect the Delinquents.</P>
<P>They were not &s;uffered to freeze. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Open fly's the Door, and out ru&s;h the Ser|vants. Nothing appear'd. They all &s;tood, &s;ilent, and a&s;toni&s;hed beyond Mea&s;ure. Some, however, with outward Bravade but inwards Tremblings, went &s;earching, along the Walls, and behind the Po&s;ts for &s;ome Lurcher. Again, they gathered to the Landing-place, and &s;tood, whi&s;pering|ly debating what this might be. When, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Terror and Di&s;comfi|ture
<PB N="199" REF="201">of all pre&s;ent, the &s;pontaneous Knock|er a&s;&s;umed &s;udden Life and Motion; and gave &s;uch a Peal and Alarm to their Eyes and Ears, as put every Sen&s;e and Re&s;olu|tion to the Rout, and in they ru&s;hed, again, one on the Back of t'other, and clapped to the Door, as in the Face of a Ho&s;t of pur&s;uing Daemons.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> and his Lady, for &s;ome Time pa&s;t, had been &s;itting oppo&s;ite, and nod|ding over a Fire in the back Parlour, where they returned each other's Salute, with the greate&s;t good Manners and Punc|tuality imaginable. He now &s;tarted, on hearing the Ru&s;tling in the Hall, and angrily called to know what was the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Vindex,</HI> from the Prejudice of Education during his Infancy, had conceived the ut|mo&s;t Spight to all Spectres and Hobgob|lins, in&s;omuch, that he wi&s;hed to deprive them of their very Exi&s;tence; and labour|ed to per&s;uade him&s;elf, as well as others, of their Nonentity, but Faith proved too &s;trong, within him, for all his verbal Pa|rade of avowed Infidelity.</P>
<P>While the Servants, with pale Faces and &s;hort Breath, made their Relation, the magi&s;terial Philo&s;opher did &s;o &s;neer, and, contemptuou&s;ly, to&s;s this Way and t'other, and throw him&s;elf back, in &s;uch
<PB N="200" REF="202">affected Fits of Laughter, as nothing could be like it. Till, bouncing, at the Sound of another Peal, he mu&s;tered the whole Family, Boaders and all, to about &s;eventeen in Number, together with Ma|dam <HI>Vindex</HI> who would not be left &s;ole; and now they appeared &s;uch an Army as was &s;ufficient to face any &s;ingle Devil, at lea&s;t, and, forth they i&s;&s;ued, and filled the Landing place, leaving the Door on the Jar.</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> turned, and, with his Face toward the Knocker thus addre&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>My hone&s;t, but &s;imple Friends, quoth he, can any Thing per&s;uade ye, that a Spirit, or Gho&s;t, as ye call it, a Breath or Being of Air, a &s;omething, or nothing, that is neither tangible, nor vi&s;ible, can lay hold of that which is? Or are ye &s;uch Idiots as to imagine, that you Knocker, (for he did not yet venture to touch it) a Sub&s;tance, of &s;olid and molten Bra&s;s, with|out Members or Organs, or any internal Sy&s;tem or Apparatus for the Purpo&s;e, can, yet, be indued with Will, De&s;ign, or any Kind of Intelligence, when the lea&s;t locomotive Faculty, in the meane&s;t Rep|tile, mu&s;t, of Nece&s;&s;ity, be provided with an infinitely varied Mechani&s;m, of Nerves, Tubes, Re&s;ervoirs, Levers, and Pulleys
<PB N="201" REF="203">for the Nonce. I &s;hould di&s;credit my own Sen&s;es on any Appearance contrary to &s;uch palpable Demon&s;tration. In all Lights &mdash; <HI>Soft &mdash; break we off &mdash; Look where it comes a|gain</HI> &mdash; For, in this In&s;tant of Affirmati|on, &s;o peremptory and conclu&s;ive; the Knocker, as in Contempt and bitter De&s;pight to Philo&s;ophy, &s;o loudly refuted every Syllable of the Premi&s;&s;es, as left neither Time nor Inclination, to <HI>Vindex,</HI> for a Reply. But, ru&s;hing de&s;perately forward, he bur&s;t in at the Portal, with &s;uch as had Pre&s;ence of Mind to take Ad|vantage of the opening, and, turning a|gain, and &s;hutting the Door violently in the Face of Half of his Family, he ran and threw him&s;elf into his Chair, in an Agony of Spirits.</P>
<P>The Servants and Boarders, whom <HI>Vindex</HI> had &s;hut out, not abiding to &s;tay in Pre&s;ence of the Object of their Terrors, tumbled, in a Heap, down the Stairs, and gathering them&s;elves up, again, ran, di|ver&s;ly, to communicate, to all their Neighbours and Acquaintance, the Ti|dings of the enchanted Knocker. Their contagious Looks and Words gave the Pannic, throughout; but, Curio&s;ity pre|vailing above Apprehen&s;ion, the Town began to gather, though, fir&s;t, in thin Parties, and at a cautious Di&s;tance; till the Croud, encrea&s;ing, took Heart and
<PB N="202" REF="204">Re&s;olution from Number, and venturing up a Step or two of the Stairs, and being &s;till pre&s;s'd and urged forward by new Comers from behind, they, at length, filled the whole Flight and the Landing-place, and one of them growing bold e|nough to lift his Hand toward the Knock|er, the Knocker generou&s;ly, convinced him that no A&s;&s;i&s;tance was wanting. Rap, rap, rap, rap. Rap, rap, rap, rap. Rap, rap, rap, rap. Back recoil the fore|mo&s;t Ranks, ca&s;ting off and tumbling over the Ranks behind. No one &s;tay'd to give Help or Hand to Friend or Brother, but, ri&s;ing, or &s;crambling off on all Fours; each made the be&s;t of his Way to the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ylum; and, in le&s;s than ten Seconds, there was not a Mou&s;e &s;tirring throughout the Street.</P>
<P>If I had the Ill-nature of mo&s;t Authors, who &s;eldom communicate any Thing worthy the Knowledge of the Public, I might, al&s;o, leave the foregoing Aenigma to be &s;olved, or rather made more implicit, in &s;uch ways as Philo&s;ophy might happen to account for. But, in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Pains of a labouring Imagination, I chu&s;e to deliver my Reader, with all po&s;&s;ible Ea&s;e and Di&s;patch.</P>
<P>The Fact is, that the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing and tremendous Phaenomena, that di&s;comfited
<PB N="203" REF="205">little City, alarmed the Country round, and re&s;u&s;citated the Stories and Legends of the old Women of all the Pari&s;hes from <HI>Barnet</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> was the whole and &s;ole Contrivance of our Hero's petulant Found|ling, during a nightly Lucubration.</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> had, accordingly, imparted his Plan of Operations to <HI>Harry,</HI> and <HI>Harry</HI> had en|gaged Mrs. <HI>Hannah</HI> in the Plot.</P>
<P>Now, Mrs. <HI>Hannah</HI> had a Hou&s;e, in a narrow Part of the Street, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to that of Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> where her Niece and an old Servant re&s;ided. This Hou&s;e was narrow, but of the Height of four Stories; and, on the &s;aid memorable Night, <HI>Ned</HI> dropped the End of a Bottom of &s;mall Twine from the Garret Window, which <HI>Hannah</HI> took, acro&s;s the Way, and fa&s;ten|ed, with a double Knot, to the Knocker of <HI>Vindex</HI>'s Door. And, now, it is twenty to one, that if <HI>Vindex</HI>'s Family and the re&s;t of the Neighbourhood had been, even thus far, let into the Secret, they would not have been, altogether, &s;o much alarm|ed at the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I have read of Generals who could gain, but not maintain Conque&s;ts; and of Wo|men who could keep all Secrets but their own. Thus it happen'd to <HI>Ned.</HI> His Vanity was, at lea&s;t, on a Level with his
<PB N="204" REF="206">Ingenuity; he was &s;o elated with the Suc|ce&s;s of his recent Stratagem, that he boa&s;t|ed of it to &s;ome, and half whi&s;pered it to others; till it came to the Ears of the much exa&s;perated <HI>Vindex. Vindex,</HI> in the fir&s;t Heat, and very Boil of his Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;natches up a huge Rod, ju&s;t cut from that Tree who&s;e bare Name &s;trikes Terror through all our Seminaries of Learning, and, taking with him one of his Boarders, he marches directly down to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> and, thus formidably armed, he enters the fatal School-room.</P>
<P><HI>Ned,</HI> by great good Fortune for him&s;elf, was then ab&s;ent. But, our Hero happen|ing to be there, <HI>Vindex,</HI> in&s;tantly, &s;hut the Door and called him to Ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, did you know any Thing of the &s;trange Knocking at my Door, la&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night? To this Que&s;ti|on, <HI>Harry,</HI> who was too valiant to be tempted to tell a Lye through Fear, with|out He&s;itation, an&s;wered in the Affirma|tive. You did, Sirrah, cried the Peda|gogue, and have you the Impudence, al&s;o, to confe&s;s it to my Face? Here, <HI>Jacky,</HI> down with his Breeches, and hor&s;e him for me directly.</P>
<P><HI>Jack</HI> was a lu&s;ty lubberly Boy, about ten Years of Age, and &s;tooping to unbut|ton
<PB N="205" REF="207"><HI>Harry,</HI> according to Order, our Hero gave him &s;uch a &s;udden Fi&s;t, in the Mouth, as da&s;hed in two of his Teeth, that then happened to be moulting, and &s;et him a crying and bleeding after a pi|teous Manner. <HI>Vindex</HI> then ro&s;e into ten|fold Fury, and took our Hero in Hands, him&s;elf, and, notwith&s;tanding that he cuffed and kicked and &s;ought it mo&s;t man|fully, <HI>Vindex,</HI> at length, unbuttoned his Breeches, and &s;et him, in due Form, on the Back of his Boarder.</P>
<P>The Pedagogue, at fir&s;t, gave him the three accu&s;tomed Strokes, as hard as he could draw. So much, my Friend, &s;ays he, is for your own Share of the Burden; and, now, tell me who were your Confe|derates and Abettors in this fine Plot? That I will never tell you, deliberately and re&s;olutely an&s;wered our Hero. What, &s;hall I be bullied and out-braved, replied the frantic Savage, by &s;uch a one as you? You little &s;tubborn Villain, I will flea you alive, I will carbonade you on the Spot. So &s;aying, he laid at him, as though he had been a Sheaf of Wheat; while <HI>Harry,</HI> indignantly, endured the Torture, and, holding, in, his Breath, that he might not give <HI>Vindex,</HI> the Satisfaction of a Groan, he determined to peri&s;h rather than betray.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208">
In the mean Time, <HI>Ned</HI> had peeped in at the Keyhole, and, &s;pying the Situation and Plight of his loved Patron, he ran to Mrs. <HI>Hannah</HI> and imparted the horrid Ti|dings. <HI>Hannah</HI> ro&s;e, with all the Wrath of <HI>Ti&s;iphone</HI> in her Countenance, and, fly|ing to the School-room, &s;he ru&s;hed violent|ly again&s;t the Door, bur&s;t it open in a twinkling, and, &s;pringing forward, fa&s;ten|ed every Nail &s;he had in the Face and Eyes of <HI>Vindex,</HI> and tore away and cuffed at a fearful Rate. <HI>Jack</HI> at this Period, had let his Rider to the Ground, when <HI>Harry,</HI> catching at a Sword, that hung a|gain&s;t the Wain&s;cot, whipt it down, and drawing it from the Sheath, as quick as Lightning, he &s;prung at <HI>Vindex,</HI> in order to run him through the Body; but, hap|pily, not having had the Patience to put up his Breeches, they trammelled him in his Advance, and he fell pro&s;trate, with the Sword, in his Hand, which reached the Leg of the Pedagogue and gave him a &s;light Wound, ju&s;t as he was endeavour|ing to make his Way through the Door. <HI>Jack</HI> had, already, made his E&s;cape, and the mauled Preceptor &s;campered after, with his Ears much better warmed, and his Temper better cooled, than when he entered.</P>

<P>During the above Tran&s;actions, the Strangers, whom Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had received into his Hou&s;e, had been tended with great Humanity and were, now, on the Recovery.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>James,</HI> on conver&s;ing with the Head of this little Family. Ob&s;erved that he was an exceeding &s;en&s;ible Per&s;on, and had provided him with a decent, though ca&s;t, Suit of his Ma&s;ters; and had al&s;o, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mrs. <HI>Hannah,</HI> put his Wife and little Boy into clean and &s;eemly Apparel.</P>
<P>As <HI>James</HI>'s Invention was on the Rack to get adequate Satisfaction on the ba&s;e &s;pirited <HI>Vindex,</HI> he went to con&s;ult his new Friend, who dropped a Tear of Genero&s;ity and Admiration, on hearing the Story of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Heroi&s;m and Nobility of Soul.</P>
<P>By his Advice, Mr. <HI>James</HI> di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to a Druggi&s;t, at <HI>London,</HI> and
<PB N="208" REF="210">to &s;everal other Shops for a &s;undry Appa|ratus, and, having all Things in Readi|ne&s;s, and, <HI>Harry</HI> being now able to bear a Part in the Play; <HI>James</HI> &s;ent a &s;trange Porter to <HI>Vindex,</HI> with Compliments from his Ma&s;ter, as though he were ju&s;t come home, and reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P><HI>Vindex,</HI> accordingly, comes, and knocks. The Door opens, he enters, and it in&s;tant|ly &s;huts upon him. He &s;tarts back with Horror as at the Sight of <HI>Medu&s;a.</HI> He perceives the Hall all in Black, without a &s;ingle Ray, &s;ave what proceeded from a &s;ickly Lamp, that made the Gloom vi&s;ible. He is &s;uddenly &s;eized upon by two robu&s;t Devils cover'd over with painted Flames. They drag him to the School-Room, but, O Terror of Terrors! he knows the Place of his pri&s;tine Authority no more. He beholds a Hell more fearful that his Fancy had yet fram'd. The Cieling &s;eemed to be vaulted with Serpents, Harpyes, and Hydras, that dropt livid Fire. On one Side ran <HI>Phlegeton,</HI> in Waves of burning Sulphur. And here, the <HI>Ti&s;iphone, Ma|gaera,</HI> and <HI>Alecto,</HI> of the Heathens, ap|peared to contend for Frightfulne&s;s with <HI>Milton</HI>'s Death and Sin. Four Fends, and two little Imps, at once laid their Fangs upon him, and would have drag'd him to the Ground. But the Pedagogue was a &s;turdy athletic Fellow, and cuffed,
<PB N="209" REF="211">and &s;cratched, and roared it out mo&s;t manfully. The Devil, however, proving too &s;trong for the Sinner, he was ca&s;t pro&s;trate to the Earth; and, being left, in Retro&s;pection, as bare as Father Time, &s;ome &s;at upon his Shoulders to keep him down, while others, on each Side, alter|nately keeping Time, like the Thre&s;hers of Barley, gave our Flogger &s;uch a Scoring; as imprinted on his Memory to the la&s;t State of Magi&s;tracy, a fellow-Feeling for the Sufferings of petty Delinquents.</P>
<P>Being all out breathed in turns, they re|mitted from their Toil; and, now, ap|peared to be a Set of the merrie&s;t Devils that ever were a&s;&s;ociated. They fa&s;tened the Clothes of the di&s;con&s;olate <HI>Vindex,</HI> a|bout his Neck, with his own Garters; and, having manacled his Hands before him, they turned him loo&s;e to the Street. While he, with a wonderful Pre&s;ence of Mind in the mid&s;t of his Terrors, rai&s;ed his Hands, the be&s;t he could, to cover his Face and hurried homeward; judiciou&s;ly recollecting, that Forty nine, in Fifty, would recognize the one End, who would not recognize the other, e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent Pickle.</P>
<P>Within a few Days, after this Adven|ture, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> returned. At the fir&s;t Sight of one another, he and his <HI>Harry,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="212">grew together for near Half an Hour. He, then, addre&s;&s;ed every Member of his Family, One by One; and, with a fami|liar Goodne&s;s, inquired after their &s;everal Healths and Concerns. He al&s;o a&s;ked after his late Gue&s;ts, and de&s;ired to &s;ee them; but, on Mr. <HI>James</HI>'s Intimation, that he had &s;omewhat of Con&s;equence to impart to him, they retired to the next Room.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>James</HI> made him a minute Recital of the preceding Adventures; and &s;et forth, in due Contra&s;t, the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Barbarity of <HI>Vindex</HI> on the one Part; and the una&s;&s;ailable Worthine&s;s of his <HI>Harry</HI> on the other. While the Prai&s;e, of this cho|&s;en of the old Gentleman's Soul, &s;unk, like the Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> upon his wound|ed Mind, and almo&s;t eradicated every Me|morial of former Grief, and planted a new Spring of Hope and Joy in their Room.</P>
<P>The Table being &s;pread for Dinner, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;ent to de&s;ire that the Stranger and his little Family &s;hould join Company. They came, according to Order, but en|tered, evidently overcome with a Weight of Shame and Gratitude too grievous to be borne.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;aw their Oppre&s;&s;ion, and felt the whole Burden upon his own Shoul|ders. He, accordingly, was intere&s;ted and
<PB N="211" REF="213">&s;olicitous in the Removal which he effect|ed with all that Addre&s;s of which his Hu|manity had made him a great Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Through the Enfoldings of the Stran|ger's Mode&s;ty, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> di&s;cerned many Things preceding the vulgar Rank of Men. Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid he, I am a&s;toni&s;hed, be|yond Mea&s;ure, that a Per&s;on of Letters, as you are, and, who has &s;o much of the Gentleman in his Per&s;on and Manner, &s;hould, yet, be reduced to &s;uch Extremi|ty; in a Chri&s;tian Country, and among a People di&s;tingui&s;hed for their Humanity. There mu&s;t be &s;omething very &s;ingular and extraordinary in your Ca&s;e. And, this Night, if you are at Lei&s;ure, and that the Recital is not di&s;agreeable to you; you would oblige me by your Story.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ince my Life is yours, you have, &s;urely, a Right to an Account of your Property. Whene|ver you think proper, I will chearfully o|bey you.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> now ro&s;e, and &s;tepped into Town; and, calling upon a Neighbour whom he took to the Tavern, he &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> who came upon the Sum|mons.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214">
Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;ays he, pray take your Seat. I am &s;orry, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> for the Treatment you have got in my Hou&s;e, and &s;till &s;orrier that you got it, &s;o very de|&s;ervedly.</P>
<P>I have long thought, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> that the Method of School-ma&s;ters, in the In|&s;truction of our Children, is altogether the Rever&s;e of what it ought to be. They, generally, lay hold on the human Con&s;ti|tution, as a Pilot lays hold of the Rudder of a Ship, by the Tail, by the &s;ingle Mo|tive, I &s;ay, of Fear alone.</P>
<P>Now, as Fear has no Concern with any Thing but Self, it is the mo&s;t confined, mo&s;t malignant, and the ba&s;e&s;t, though the &s;tronge&s;t, of all Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Party, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it, will li&s;ten to nothing but the Dictates of his own Terror, nor &s;cruple any Thing that may cover him from the Evil appre|hended. He will prevaricate, and lye; if that Lye is que&s;tioned he will vouch it by Perjury; and, if he happens to do an In|jury, he will be tempted to commit Mur|der to prevent the Effects of Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Fear never was a Friend to the Love of God, or Man, to Duty, or Con&s;cience
<PB N="113" REF="215">Truth, Probity, or Honour. It, there|fore, can never make a good Subject, a good Citizen, or a good Soldier; and, lea&s;t of all, a good Chri&s;tian. Except the Devils, who believe and tremble, are to be accounted good Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>How very different is the Le&s;&s;on which our Ma&s;ter CHRIST teacheth, who com|mandeth us, not to fear what Man can do unto us; to &s;mile in Sickne&s;s and Calami|ty; to ri&s;e &s;uperior to Pain and Death; and to regard nothing, but as it leads to the Goal of that Immortality which his Go&s;pel has brought to Light.</P>
<P>There is, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> but one Occa&s;i|on, wherein Fear may be u&s;eful, in Schools or Common-wealths. That is, when it is placed as a Guard again&s;t Evil, and ap|pears, with its En&s;ignia of Rods, Ropes, and Axes, to deter all, who behold, from approaching thereto.</P>
<P>But this, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> is far from being the &s;ole Occa&s;ion on which School-ma&s;ters apply the Motive of Fear and Ca&s;tigation. They a&s;&s;ociate the Ideas of Pain to tho&s;e Le&s;&s;ons and Virtues which the Plea&s;ure of Encouragement ought, alone, to inculcate. They, yet, more frequently apply the La&s;h, for the Indulgence of their own Weakne&s;&s;es, and for the Gratification of
<PB N="114" REF="216">the Virulence of their own naughty Pa&s;&s;i|ons. And I have &s;een a Giant of a Peda|gogue, raving, raging, and foaming over a Group of &s;hrinking Infants; like a Kite over a crouching Parcel of young Turkeys.</P>
<P>There are, I admit &s;ome Parents and Preceptors who annex other Motives to that of the Rod. They promi&s;e Money, gaudy Clothes, and Sweet Meats to Chil|dren; and, in their Manner of expatiating on the U&s;e and Value of &s;uch Articles; they often excite, in their little Minds, the Appetites of Avarice, of Vanity, and Sen|&s;uality. They, al&s;o, &s;ometimes add the Motive of what they call Emulation, but which, in Fact, is rank Envy, by telling one Boy how much happier, or richer, or finer, another is, than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now, though Envy and Emulation are often confounded, in Terms; there are not two Things more different, both in re&s;pect to their Object, and in re&s;pect to their Operation. The Object of Envy is the Per&s;on, and not the Excellence, of any one; but the Object of Emulation is Ex|cellence, alone; as when CHRIST, excit|ing us to be emulous of the Excellence of <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, bids us <HI>be perfect, as our Fa|ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI> The Operation of Envy is to pull others down.
<PB N="215" REF="217">But the Act of Emulation is to exalt our|&s;elves to &s;ome Eminence or Height pro|po&s;ed. The Eyes of Envy are &s;ore and &s;ickly, and hate to look at the Light. But Emulation has the Eye of an Eagle and &s;oars, while it gazes in the Face of the Sun.</P>
<P>Were Tutors half as &s;olicitous, through|out their Academies, to make Men of Worth, as to make Men of Letters; there are a hundred pretty Artifices, very obvi|ous to be contrived and practi&s;ed, for the Purpo&s;e. They might in&s;titute <HI>Caps of Shame,</HI> and <HI>Wreaths of Honour,</HI> in their Schools. They might have little Medals, expre&s;&s;ive of particular Virtues, to be fixed on the Brea&s;t of the Atchiever, till forfeit|ed by Default. And on the Report of any Boy's having performed a &s;ignal Acti|on of Good-Nature, Friend&s;hip, Gratitude, Genero&s;ity, or Honour; a Place of Emi|nence might be appointed for him to &s;it on, while all the re&s;t of the School &s;hould bow, in Deference, as they pa&s;&s;ed. Such Arts, as the&s;e, I &s;ay, with that di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Affection, and Approbation, which all Per&s;ons ought to &s;hew to Children of Me|rit, would &s;oon make a new Nation of In|fants, and, con&s;equently, of Men.</P>
<P>When you, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> iniquitou&s;ly, took upon you to cha&s;ti&s;e my mo&s;t noble
<PB N="216" REF="218">and mo&s;t incomparable Boy, you, fir&s;t, whipt him for his gallant and generous Avowal of the Truth. And, next, you barbarou&s;ly flead him; becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to betray tho&s;e who had confided in his Integrity.</P>
<P>When I behold &s;o many Scoundrels walking, openly, throughout the Land, who are &s;tiled your Honour, and your Ho|nour, and who, impudently u&s;urp the <HI>mo&s;t exalted of all Characters,</HI> the Character of <HI>a Gentleman.</HI> I no longer wonder, when I reflect, that they have been principled, or rather unprincipled, by &s;uch Tutors as Mr. <HI>Vindex.</HI></P>
<P>The merry Devils, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> who took you in Hand, were not of a Species, &s;o alienated from Humanity, as you might imagine. They have, therefore, appoint|ed me their Vehicle of &s;ome Smart-Money, in Recompence, but, de&s;ire no further Advantage from your Company or In|&s;tructions.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> put a Pur&s;e of five and twenty Guineas into the Hands of the Pedagogue, and withdrew without &s;peaking another Word.</P>

<P>Why, there's the Plague on't now,&mdash;You begin to kindle already.&mdash;Ah, were you Authors to know the thou|&s;andth Part of the Liberties that are taken behind your Backs, you would learn to bear, with more Humility, a gentle Ad|monition though uttered to your Faces.&mdash;Few, indeed, have the Genero&s;ity, or even Humanity to intimate what they them&s;elves think, or what the World &s;peaks of you. We are &s;eldom over for|ward to &s;ay any Thing that might give Di&s;plea&s;ure to others, becau&s;e we like that others &s;hould be plea&s;ed with our&s;elves; but, in your Ab&s;ence, we pay our&s;elves largely for our Taciturnity in your Pre|&s;ence; and I have often been in Company,
<PB N="218" REF="220">where the Intimates and Confidents of you Authors, have depreciated and ridiculed the very &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ages, which they ap|plauded with Cries and Claps in your Clo|&s;ets. The World, my Friend, has &s;ub|&s;tituted <HI>good Manners</HI> in the Place of <HI>good Nature,</HI> whoever conforms to the former is di&s;pen&s;ed with from any Ob&s;ervance of the latter. Shall I add, (for the Misfor|tune of you Authors,) that there is a Set of Men who, at once, di&s;pen&s;e with com|mon Manners and common Humanity. They go under the Name of Crities, and mu&s;t be Men of Wealth, that the Defe|rence paid to Fortune, may give a Sort of Stamp and Currency to the Dro&s;s of their Erudition. In the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, indeed, they may be called <HI>Men of Letters,</HI> their Study, as well as Capacity, being nearly confined to a ju&s;t or orthographical Di&s;po|&s;ition of the Alphabet. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to reconoitre the Outworks of Genius, as they have no Key to the Gates of Nature or Sentiment. They &s;nuff Faults from afar, as Crows &s;cent Carrion, and delight to pick, and to prey, and to dwell upon them. They enter, like Wa&s;ps, upon the Gardens of Literature, not to reli&s;h any Fragrance of &s;elect any Sweets, but to pamper their Malevolence with every Thing that &s;avours of Rankne&s;s or Of|fence. Happily for them. their Sagacity does not tend to the Di&s;covery of Merit,
<PB N="219" REF="221">in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, a Work of Genius would give them the Spleen for a Month, or po&s;&s;ibly depre&s;s their Spirits beyond Re|covery.</P>
<P>To the&s;e high and dreaded <HI>Lords Ju&s;ti|ciaries,</HI> the <HI>Critics,</HI> Authors deem it in|cumbent to &s;ubmit the Products of their Lucubrations; not in the Pro&s;pect of any Advantage from their Advice or Animad|ver&s;ions; neither in the Hopes of acquir|ing their Friend&s;hip or Patronage; but merely to &s;ooth and deprecate the Effects of their Malignity. Accordingly, I have been pre&s;ent, when &s;ome of the&s;e Dictators have been pre&s;ented with a Manu&s;cript, as with an humble Petition; they have there|upon a&s;&s;umed the Chair, as a Judge a&s;|&s;umes the Bench when a Criminal is called before him, not in order to Trial or Hear|ing, but to Sentence and Condemnation. To what Scenes of Mortification have I been Witne&s;s on &s;uch Occa&s;ions! to what a State of Abatement, of Aba&s;ement, of Annihilation, have the&s;e Entertainers of the Public been depre&s;&s;ed!&mdash;<Q>I am &s;orry, Sir, to tell you that this will not do.&mdash;A few Attempts here and there, but that will not compen&s;ate&mdash;Here again how injudicious, ab&s;urd, unpar|donable!&mdash;Lord, Sir, you &s;hould have con&s;idered that when a Man &s;its down to write for the Public, the lea&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="222">Compliment they expect from him is that he &s;hould think&mdash;Here, my Friend, I have &s;een enough, I cannot affront my Judgment &s;o much as either to recommend or patronize your Per|formance, all I can do for you is to be filent on the Subject, and permit Fools to approve who have not Sen&s;e to di&s;|cern.</Q> &mdash;Thus do the&s;e Critics-para|mount, with the Delicacy and Compa&s;&s;ion of the Torturers of the Inqui&s;ition, &s;earch out all the Seats of Sen&s;ibility and Self-Complacence, in order to &s;ting with the more quick and killing Poignancy.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Friend, as you have not applied for the Favour of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed Arbitrators of Genius and Literature, you are not to expect the lea&s;t Mercy from them, and I am al&s;o free to tell you that I know of no Writer who lies more open to their Attacks.

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE MAN OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>BAR THOLOMEW CLEMENT, Sir, a Retailer of Hard Ware, on the Strand, is my Father. He was low-bred,
<PB N="224" REF="226">and, as I believe, of narrow Capacity; but, proceeding in, what they call, the Dog-Trot of Life, and, having a &s;ingle Eye to the making of Money, he became va&s;tly rich, and has, now, a large Income, from Hou&s;es and Ground Rents in the City of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the Fruits and Acqui|&s;ition of his own Application.</P>
<P>I remember nothing of my Mother, except her Fondne&s;s for me, nor of her Character, except the Tears that I have &s;een my Father &s;hed, when occa&s;ional Cir|cum&s;tances have brought her fre&s;h to his Memory. She died, when I was in my &s;e|venth Year. I was their only &s;urviving Child; and my Father transferred all his Tenderne&s;s, for her, to me.</P>
<P>The Love of my Father was not the mere Partiality or Prejudice of a Parent; it was not an Affection, he had a Pa&s;&s;ion for me, that could be equalled by nothing but his Vanity, in my behalf. He re&s;olv|ed, he &s;aid, that there &s;hould be one Gen|tleman in the Family, and, with this View, he re&s;i&s;ted his De&s;ire of having me, al|ways, in his Sight, and &s;ent me to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> School, and from thence to <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>-College, where I continued till I was twenty Years of Age, without any Thing happening, that was uncommon, or de&s;erving of your Attention.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">
In the mean Time, my Father was as prodigal of his Pur&s;e, toward me, as he was of his Care&s;&s;es. He had me with him, ev'ry Vacation. He vi&s;ited me, fre|quently, during Term; and &s;eemed to lo&s;e the better Half of his Exi&s;tence, when we parted.</P>
<P>He had infu&s;ed into me a &s;trong Tinc|ture of his own Vanity and Views. I lo&s;t even a Portion of that Tenderne&s;s and Re&s;pect which I had felt, in his Regard. He was a Trader, a Mechanick, I &s;ighed for his reptile State; and I looked down upon him, as <HI>Icarus</HI> did on that very Fa|ther, from whom he had derived Wings for &s;o exalted a Flight.</P>
<P>My Application, accordingly, was equal to my Ambition. I was not, merely, a Ma&s;ter, I was a Critic in the cla&s;&s;ical Lan|guages. I reli&s;hed, and commented on the Beauties of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Au|thors. Was a thorough Connoi&s;&s;eur, in the Cu&s;toms and Manners of the Ancients, and could detect the &s;lighte&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|on of a Sculptor or De&s;igner, in their folding of the <HI>Roman</HI> Toga. I al&s;o had the Honour to be intimate with all the Great of Antiquity, I frequently &s;at, in Synod, with the whole Po&s;&s;e of Heathen Gods, on <HI>Olympus;</HI> and I kept them as
<PB N="226" REF="228">I imagined, in a kind of Dependence, by my perfect Knowledge of all their &s;ecret Lap&s;es and Mi&s;treadings. I had traced the Sy&s;tem of Nature, from <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras</HI> down to <HI>Epicurus</HI> and <HI>Lucretius,</HI> and from them down to <HI>Des Cartes, Ga&s;|&s;endi,</HI> and <HI>Hobbes,</HI> and, I was &s;o thorough paced an Adept in all the Subtleties of Lo|gic; that I could confute, and change Sides, without lo&s;ing an Inch of the Ground that I had gained upon my Ad|ver&s;ary.</P>
<P>I now, imagined that I was arrived at the very Pinnacle of human Excellence, and that Fortune and Honour were within my Gra&s;p, on either Hand. I looked on the Chancellor&s;hip; or Primacy, as Things that mu&s;t come, in Cour&s;e.

<P>For &s;ome Time after the receipt of this cruel Letter, I remained in a State of Stupidity. I could not believe the Te&s;ti|mony of my Sen&s;es. I gave a kind of Di&s;credit to all Things. But, awaking from this Lethargy into inexpre&s;&s;ible An|gui&s;h, my Soul was rent by different and contending Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Whatever Contempt I might have for the Station of my Father, I &s;till loved his Per&s;on better than Riches and Honours. But he loved me no more, he was gone, he was lo&s;t; he was already dead and bu|ried, at lea&s;t to me. I ca&s;t my&s;elf on the Ground, I groaned, I wept aloud, I be|wail'd him, as though he had lain a life|le&s;s Corp&s;e, before me. At length having vented the fir&s;t Ravings of my Pa&s;&s;ion; I ro&s;e and wrote to my Father an An&s;wer, of which this, in my Pocket-Book, is the Copy.</P>

<P>IF you had not wi&s;hed to find tho&s;e Faults you &s;ent to &s;eek after, in a Life that defies Malice and is wholly ir|reproachable, you would not have given Credit to Scoundrels who cannot judge of the Conduct of a Gentleman, nor have condemned your only Child, with|out Hearing or Defence.</P>
<P>In cutting me from your Fortune, you only cut me from what I de&s;pi&s;e, but, in cutting me from your Love, you have, unju&s;tly, robbed me of that which no Fortune can repair. I &s;ee that you are, irretrievably, taken away from me. I &s;hall never more behold my long in|dulgent and fond Father; and I &s;hall not cea&s;e to lament his Lo&s;s with Tears of filial Affection. But, for this new Fa|ther, who&s;e Heart could dictate &s;o un|natural and inhuman a Letter, I equally di&s;claim all Commerce and Concern with him. And, could it be po&s;&s;ible that a Per&s;on, of my Talents and Abilities, &s;hould be reduced to Indigence or Di&s;|tre&s;s; you, Sir, are the very la&s;t Man upon Earth, to whom I would apply, or from whom I would deign to accept Relief.</P>

<P>Having thus vented the Gu&s;ts and Feel|ings of my Heart, I began, &s;eriou&s;ly, to think of the Cour&s;e I ought to take; and con&s;idered <HI>London</HI> as the Sphere in which a Luminary would appear with the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>I di&s;charged my Servant. Sold my two Geldings. Di&s;po&s;ed of my Room, my Furniture, and mo&s;t of my Books. And, having mu&s;tered &s;omewhat upward of three hundred and fifty Pounds, I lodged the &pound;300 with a <HI>Cambridge</HI> Dealer, from
<PB N="230" REF="232">whom I took Bills on his Corre&s;pondent in <HI>London;</HI> and &s;et out, on my Expedition, in the fir&s;t Stage.</P>
<P>I took cheap Lodgings, near <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> I was, altogether unknowing and unknown in that great City; and, reflect|ing that a hidden Trea&s;ure cannot be duely e&s;timated, I daily frequented <HI>Markham</HI>'s Coffee-Hou&s;e, amid&s;t a promi&s;cuous Re|&s;ort of Swords-men, Literati, Beaus, and Politicians.</P>
<P>Here, happening to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, on a few Occa&s;ions, where &s;ome Articles of ancient Hi&s;tory, or Tenet of <HI>Thales,</HI> or Law of <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> chanced to be in Que&s;ti|on; I began to be regarded with better Advantage.</P>
<P>An elderly Gentleman, one Day, who &s;at attentive in a Corner, got up and whi&s;pered that he would be glad of my Company to take &s;hare of a Pint in the next Room. I gratefully obeyed the Sum|mons, and, when we had drank a Gla&s;s a Piece; Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, you appear to have but few Acquaintance, and may, po&s;&s;ibly, want a Friend. My Fortune is &s;mall, but, I have &s;ome Influence in this Town; and, as I have taken an Inclinati|on to you, I &s;hould be glad to &s;erve you. If the Que&s;tion is not too free, pray, what
<PB N="231" REF="233">is your pre&s;ent Dependence, and Pro&s;pect for Life?</P>
<P>Having, with a grateful Warmth, ac|knowledged his Goodne&s;s to me, I, inge|nuou&s;ly, confe&s;&s;ed that my Circum&s;tances were very &s;lender, and, that I &s;hould be glad of any Place wherein I could be u&s;e|ful to my&s;elf and my Employer. And pray, &s;ays my Friend, what Place would be&s;t &s;uit you? I hope, Sir, an&s;wered I, my Education has been &s;uch, that, laying a&s;ide the manual Crafts, there is not any Thing for which I am not qualified. I am greatly plea&s;ed to hear it, replied Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> and hope, &s;oon, to bring you News that will not be di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Within a few Days, Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> a|gain, entered the Coffee-hou&s;e with a hap|py A&s;pect. He beckoned me a&s;ide. <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> &s;ays he, I have the Plea&s;ure to tell you that I have brought you the Choice of two very advantageous Places. Mr. <HI>Giles,</HI> the Banker, wants a Clerk who can write a fine Hand, and has made &s;ome Proficiency in Arithmetic. And, my good Friend Mr. <HI>Tradewell,</HI> an eminent Mer|chant, would give large Encouragement to a Youth who under&s;tands the <HI>Italian</HI> Me|thod of Book-keeping; as his Bu&s;ine&s;s is very exten&s;ive and requires the &s;horte&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="234">and cleare&s;t Manner of Entry and Refe|rence.</P>
<P>My Friend here pau&s;ed; and I blu&s;hed, hung down my Head, and was wholly con|founded. At length, I an&s;wered, he&s;itat|ingly, Perhaps, Sir, you have happened on the only two Articles, in the Univer&s;e, (Mechanics, as I &s;aid, apart,) of which I have no Knowledge. Well, well, my Boy, &s;ays he, don't be di&s;couraged, I will try what further may be done in your Behalf.</P>
<P>Within about a Fortnight after, Mr. <HI>Goodville</HI> &s;ent me a Note to attend him at his Lodgings, in <HI>Red-lion Square.</HI> I went, flu&s;hed with reviving Hope. My Child, &s;aid he, as I entered, I have, now, brought you the Offer of three different Places; and, &s;ome one of them, as I tru&s;t, mu&s;t &s;urely fit you.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Ea&s;t-india</HI> Company propo&s;e to make a Settlement on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coro|mandel,</HI> and are inqui&s;itive after &s;ome Youths who have made a Progre&s;s in Geometry, and are, more e&s;pecially, &s;tu|died in the Science of Fortification. There is, al&s;o, the Colonel of a Regiment, an old Intimate of mine, who is going on foreign Service, and he, in Truth, applied to me, to recommend a Per&s;on who was &s;killed in the Mechanic Powers, and, more particu|larly,
<PB N="233" REF="235">who had applied him&s;elf to Gunnery and Engineering. There is, la&s;tly, the &s;e|cond Son of a Nobleman to whom I have the Honour to be known; he is Captain of a Man of War, and would give any Con&s;ideration to a young Man of Sen&s;e and Letters, who is a Poficient, in Naviga|tion and in the U&s;e of the Charts and Compa&s;s, and who, at the &s;ame Time, might &s;erve as a Friend and Companion.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, quite a&s;toni&s;hed, I have been a Student, as <HI>Goliah</HI> was a Man of War, from my Childhood. If all my Tutors did not flatter me, my Genius was exten|&s;ive; and my Progre&s;s, in Learning, may prove that my Application has been inde|fatigable. I know all Things, from the Beginning of Time, that the ancient or modern World, as I was told, accounted Matters of valuable Erudition or Recogni|zance; and, yet, I have not &s;o much as heard of the U&s;e or E&s;timation of any of the&s;e Sciences required, as you &s;ay, by Per&s;ons in high Tru&s;t and Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> hereupon, looked con|cerned and &s;hook his Head. My dear <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I do not doubt your Ta|lents or Learning; but, I, now, begin to doubt whether they have been directed or applied to any u&s;eful Purpo&s;e. My Cou&s;in <HI>Goodville</HI> informs me that the Bi&s;hop of St.

He tells me, further, that a Gentleman, a Friend of his, who is in great Circum&s;tances, and who is now about purcha&s;ing the Place of Surveyor General, wants a Youth who has got &s;ome little &s;mattering in Architecture, and has an e|legant Hand at the Drawing of Plans and Sections. I am al&s;o known to one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Exci&s;e, and, if you are barely initiated in Gauging, or Surveying, I think I could get you into &s;ome Way of Bread.</P>
<P>Alas, Sir, I replied, in a de&s;ponding Tone, I am equally a Stranger to all the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>Perhaps, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> I could get you into holy Orders, if you are that way inclined. Are you well read in <HI>Theology?</HI></P>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir, I bri&s;kly an&s;wered, I am perfectly acquainted with the Gods and Manners of Wor&s;hip, through all Nations, &s;ince the Deluge.</P>
<P>But, are you, replied my Friend, equal|ly ver&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation? Have you &s;tudied our learned Commenta|tors
<PB N="235" REF="239">on the Creeds; are you read in <HI>Pole|mic</HI> Divinity? and, are you a Ma&s;ter of the Sen&s;e and emblematical Reference that the Old Te&s;tament bears to the New?</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, I have often dipped, with Plea&s;ure, into the Bible, as there are many Pa&s;&s;ages, in it, extremely affecting; and others full of fine Imagery and the true Sublime.</P>
<P>My poor dear Child, (mournfully an|&s;wered Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI>) by all I can find, you know no one Thing, of U&s;e to your|&s;elf, or any other Per&s;on living, either with re&s;pect to this World or the World to come. Could you make a Pin, or a Wai&s;tcoat Button, or form a Pill Box, or weave a Cabbage Net, or &s;hape a Cobler's La&s;t, or hew a Block for a Barber, or do any of tho&s;e Things by which Millions, daily, maintain them&s;elves, in &s;upplying the Wants and Occa&s;ions, or Fa&s;hions and Vanities of others; you might not be un|der the Nece&s;&s;ity of peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Ways of Life, for which your Studies have be&s;t prepared you, are Phy|&s;ic and the Law. But, then, they require great Expence, and an inten&s;e Application of many Years to come, before you can propo&s;e to enter on a Livelihood, by either of tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions. And, after all, your
<PB N="236" REF="240">Succe&s;s would be very precarious, if you were not &s;upported, by many Friends and a &s;trong Intere&s;t, at lea&s;t on your &s;etting out.</P>
<P>I have, already, told you, <HI>Clement,</HI> that I am not rich; and, if I were; it is not he who gives you Money, but he who puts you into a way of getting it, that does you a Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I am advi&s;ed to go to <HI>Montpellier</HI> for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of my Health, after a tedi|ous Fit of Sickne&s;s that I had at <HI>Bath.</HI> I &s;hall &s;et out, in about a Month. But, be|fore I go, my Child, I earne&s;tly wi&s;h, and advi&s;e you, to fix on &s;ome Craft, or Trade, or Manner of employing your Time, that will enable you to earn a certain Sub&s;i&s;t|ance, and, at the &s;ame Time, make you a worthy Member of the Community. For, believe me, my Boy, that it is not &s;peculative Science; no, nor all the Mo|ney and Jewels upon Earth, that make any Part of the real Wealth of this World. It is Indu&s;try, alone, employed on Articles that are u&s;eful and beneficial to Society, that con&s;titutes the true Riches of all Man|kind.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as you have made your Electi|on, let me &s;ee you again. And, in all e|vents, let me &s;ee you before I &s;et out.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="241">
Hereupon, I bowed and retired, the mo&s;t mortified and dejected of all Beings. I was &s;o low and di&s;pirited that I could &s;carce get to my Lodgings. I threw my&s;elf on the Bed. The Gildings of the Vapours of Grandeur and Ambition, that like the Sky of a Summer's Evening had delighted my Pro&s;pects, now wholly di&s;appeared, and a Night of &s;ucceeding Darkne&s;s fell heavy on my Soul.</P>
<P>One third of my principal Fund was almo&s;t &s;unk; and my Imagination con&s;i|dered the Remainder, as already vani&s;hed, without the Po&s;&s;ibility of Supply or Re|&s;ource. I, now, &s;ecretly cur&s;ed the Vanity of my Father: He mu&s;t breed me a Gen|man, thought I, with a Pox, as though I had been born to no Manner of End. Had I been the Son of a Cobler, of a Por|ter, an O&s;tler, of the lowe&s;t Wretch who wins his Bread by the Sweat of his Brow; I &s;hould not yet have been reduced to the wor&s;t Species of Beggary, that of begging with &s;ound Limbs and a rea&s;onable Soul, the lea&s;t pitied, though mo&s;t pitiable Ob|ject of the Creation; for, &s;urely, that is the Ca&s;e of a poor Scholar and a poor Gen|tleman.</P>
<P>For &s;ome following Days, I went about, prying and enquiring into the various and
<PB N="238" REF="242">numberle&s;s Occupations that maintained &s;o many Thou&s;ands of active Hands and bu&s;y Faces, throughout that wonderful City.</P>
<P>One Evening, as I returned late, and fatigued, through <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> I ob&s;erved a Man very importunate with a Woman who walked before me. Sometimes &s;he would hurry on, and, again, make a full Stop, and earne&s;tly be&s;eech him to go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s; but, in &s;pight of her Entreaties, he &s;till &s;tuck clo&s;e to her, till, coming to the End of a blind Alley, he, &s;uddenly, &s;eized her by the Arm, and pulled her in after him.</P>
<P>She &s;hrieked out for Help, with repeat|ed Vociferation; when, recollecting all my Force, and drawing my Sword; Villain, I cried out, quit the Woman, in&s;tantly, or you are a dead Man. He perceived the Glittering of the Weapon and retired a few Paces; but, taking out a Pocket Pi&s;tol, he di&s;charged it full at me, and ran off with Precipitation.</P>
<P>The Ball entered my Clothes and Fle&s;h and lodg'd on the Rotula of my left Arm. I felt a &s;hort Pang, but, not attending to it, I took the Woman under the Arm, and, returning with her to the Street, I told her we had no Time to lo&s;e, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="239" REF="243">to know where &s;he lived. She an|&s;wered, at the Sign of the Fan and Ruffle, in <HI>Fleet Street,</HI> where &s;he kept a Milliner's Shop. We had not far to go; we made the be&s;t of our Speed, and were let in by a Servant Maid who &s;hew'd us to a back Parlour.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> (that was her Name) bring a Gla&s;s and a Bottle of the Cordial-Wine, you look a little pale, Sir, I hope you are not hurt. Not much, I think, Madam, but I feel a &s;mall Pain in my left Shoulder. Sir, here is my be&s;t Service to you, with my be&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings and Prayers for you to the la&s;t Hour of my Life. You mu&s;t drink it off, Sir, we both &s;tood in Need of it; this was a frightful Affair. <HI>Jenny,</HI> where's <HI>Arabella?</HI> within a few Doors, Madam, at the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es.</HI> Come, Sir, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> I mu&s;t look at your Shoulder, then, open|ing the Top of my Wai&s;tcoat, &s;he, in|&s;tantly &s;creamed out. God pre&s;erve my Deliverer! I fear he is wounded dange|rou&s;ly. <HI>Jenny,</HI> fly to Mr. <HI>Weldon</HI>'s, bring him with you, immediately, do not come without him. Deare&s;t, worthie&s;t of Men, let me pre&s;s another Gla&s;s upon you. It is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Wa&s;te of Blood and Spirits. Madam, I replied, the Wound can't be of Con&s;equence, but, I was great|ly
<PB N="240" REF="244">fatigued, at the Time that I had the Happine&s;s to re&s;cue you from that Ruffian.</P>
<P>The Surgeon &s;oon came, and, looking at my Wound, &s;aid &s;omething apart, to Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> who, thereupon, order'd <HI>Jenny</HI> to get a Fire and to make, and warm the Bed in the be&s;t Chamber.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I to Mr. <HI>Weldon,</HI> don't alarm the Gentlewoman. I am not of a fearful Temper and hope to bear my Fortune like a Man, Sir, &s;aid he, your Wound has been made by a rifled Ball, and it may co&s;t you much Pain to extract it. You mu&s;t not think of &s;tirring from hence, for the pre&s;ent. By the Time your Bed is ready, I will be back with the Dre&s;&s;|ings.</P>
<P>During the Surgeon's Ab&s;ence, Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> was all in Tears; while I &s;at &s;u&s;|pended between my natural Fears of an approaching Di&s;&s;olution, and my Hopes of being &s;uddenly and la&s;tingly provided for. The Cruelty of my Father, the Di&s;ap|pointment and overthrow of all my eleva|ted Expectations, and my utter Incapaci|ty of being of the &s;malle&s;t U&s;e to my&s;elf or Mankind, had given me a kind of Loathing to Life. I had not, indeed, at|tended to my Duty as a Chri&s;tian! but, I was, then, Innocent of any actual or in|tentional
<PB N="241" REF="245">Evil, and as my Con&s;cience did not condemn me, I looked to Mercy with a kind of humble Re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Weldon</HI> came with the Dre&s;&s;ings, his elde&s;t Apprentice, and a Man Servant. I was, then conducted to my Chamber and helped to Bed, where I was put to great Angui&s;h in the Extraction of the Ball; as the Perio&s;tium had been lacera|ted, and that the Lead, being flattened, extended much beyond the Wound it had made.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed a very painful and re&s;t|le&s;s Night, I remember'd nothing further till at the Expiration of one and twenty Days, I &s;eemed to awaken out of a long and unea&s;y Dream.</P>
<P>I turned my Head and beheld as I ima|gined, all arrayed in &s;hining White, and at my Bed&s;ide, an Inhabitant of &s;ome &s;u|perior Region; for never till then had I &s;een, nor even conceived an Idea of any Form &s;o lovely.</P>
<P>Tell me, &s;aid I, fair Creature, on what World am I thrown? But in&s;tead of reply|ing, it flew out of my Apartment and &s;oon after, returned, accompanied by Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> who&s;e Hands and Eyes were ele|vated, as in &s;ome extraordinary Emotion.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="246">
Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> &s;aid I, how do You do? I hope You are well. I now beign to con|jecture whereabouts I am. But, neither did &s;he an&s;wer; but, falling on her Knees by my Bed, and taking hold of my Hand, I thank, I thank thee, O my God, &s;he cried, and, bur&s;ting into Tears, &s;he wept and &s;obbed like an Infant. Ah, Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> &s;aid I, I fear that you have had a very trouble&s;ome Gue&s;t of me. But then, &s;ays &s;he, we remember that Trouble no more, now that you are, once again, born into the World.</P>
<P>During the few &s;ucceeding Days, in which I kept my Bed, Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> and her fair Niece <HI>Arabella,</HI> whom I had taken for a Vi&s;ion, con&s;tantly breakfa&s;ted and &s;pent their Evening in my Apartment.</P>
<P>I gave them a &s;hort Narrative of my foregoing Hi&s;tory; and under&s;tood, on their Part, that they were the Si&s;ter and Daughter of the late reverend Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> of <HI>Putney,</HI> who had little more to bequeath than his Books and Furniture, amounting to about five hundred Pounds, which they held, in joint Stock, and had, hitherto, rather encrea&s;ed than dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>As I &s;carce remembered my Mother, and had now, as it were no Father, Re|lation,
<PB N="243" REF="247">nor Friend upon Earth, I felt a Va|cuity in my Soul, &s;omewhat like that of an empty Stomach, de&s;irous of &s;eizing on the fir&s;t Food that &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf to my Cravings. Delightful Sen&s;ibilities! Sweet Hungerings of Nature after its Kind! This good Woman and her Niece became all the World to me. The one had con|ceived, for me, all the Pa&s;&s;ion of a Parent; the other, that of the fonde&s;t and tender|e&s;t of Si&s;ters. On the other Hand, I had, for Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> all the Feelings of a Child who conceives him&s;elf a Part of the Exi&s;t|ence of her who bore him; and my Eyes and Actions could not forbear to di&s;cover, to <HI>Arabella,</HI> that my Heart was that of the mo&s;t affectionate of Brothers, though too delicate to indulge it&s;elf in tho&s;e familiar Endearments which the Nearne&s;s of Kin|dred might venture to claim.</P>
<P>When I was up and about the Hou&s;e, I reque&s;ted Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> to make out her Bill for my Board, and for Phy&s;ician, Sur|geon, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> during my long Illne&s;s. Hereupon, &s;he looked eagergly and ten|derly at me. Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I think you are too generous, de&s;ignedly, to reproach us with what we owe you. But, for what is it, my Child, that you de&s;ire us to charge you? Is it for re&s;cuing me from Death, or a Shame wor&s;e than Death, probably, from both? or, is it for
<PB N="244" REF="248">delivering this my Darling from the bitter Grief and Di&s;tre&s;s that my Lo&s;s mu&s;t have brought upon her? Or, do you, rather, de&s;ire to pay us for the fearful Pains and Sickne&s;s which you &s;uffered on our Ac|count, and for having, nearly, forfeited your Life in our Defence? No, Mr. <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> you mu&s;t not think of paying us the very Debts that we owe you; more indeed, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> than all our little Fortune, than the Product of the Indu&s;try of our Lives can ever repay.</P>
<P>Here, I was &s;ilenced, for the pre&s;ent, but, in no Degree convinced. And I felt, in a &s;ort, the Di&s;gu&s;t of an injured Per&s;on, unea&s;y and &s;tudious, till &s;ome Revenge might be had.</P>
<P>In two Days after, while Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> was at Market, and <HI>Arabella</HI> gone, with a Bru&s;&s;els Head and Ruffles, to a young La|dy of Di&s;tinction; I &s;tepped into the Shop, where <HI>Jenny</HI> waited the Commands of tho&s;e that &s;hould call. I had &s;carce entered, when a Sheriff's Officer, appear'd at the Door, and, bolting in laid an Execution on the Shop, for eighty five Pounds odd Shillings, at the Suit of Mr. <HI>Hardgrave</HI> the Cambric and Lace-Merchant.</P>
<P>I was, at fir&s;t, &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved, but Plea&s;ure, quickly, &s;ucceeded to my
<PB N="245" REF="249">Concern on the Occa&s;ion. I took out my Pocket-Book, immediately di&s;charged the Debt, with Co&s;ts, and gave a Crown to <HI>Jenny,</HI> on her &s;olemn A&s;&s;urance that &s;he would not betray a Syllable of what had happened to her Mi&s;tre&s;s or <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, this good Gentlewoman and her Niece returned, Dinner was ordered up, and I &s;at down to Table with a Heart and Countenance more ea&s;y and chearful than ordinary.</P>
<P>Before the Cloth was removed, <HI>Jenny</HI> came and delivered a Note to her Mi&s;tre&s;s. She read it over and over with apparent Surpri&s;e and Attention, a&s;ked if the Me&s;|&s;enger was waiting, and &s;tepped to the Door. Again, &s;he returned, &s;at down without &s;peaking a Word, and, the Mu&s;|cles of her Countenance being &s;trongly af|fected, &s;he could no longer retain her Pa&s;|&s;ion, and her Tears bur&s;t forth.</P>
<P>What is the Matter, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Aunt, my dear dear Mother, my only Friend and Parent? and, breaking al&s;o into Tears, &s;he threw her&s;elf about her Neck?</P>
<P>Oh, there is no bearing of this, exclaim|ed Mrs. <HI>Graves.</HI> This young Man, my <HI>Arabella,</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es us beyond Expre&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="246" REF="250">He has, this very Day, my Love, for the &s;econd Time, &s;natched us from in&s;tant Ruin. I would tell you, if I could &s;peak; but read that Note. Which &s;he did, ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>The Note was &s;igned <HI>Free&s;tone Hardgrave,</HI> and imported how &s;orry he was, that his late Lo&s;&s;es, by Sea, had put him under the Nece&s;&s;ity of laying an Execution on her Hou&s;e, without cu&s;tomary Notice. That he was glad, however, &s;he had &s;o large a Sum ready as &pound;90, the Receipt of which he acknowledged; and hoped that this Af|fair would make no Difference with re&s;pect to their future Dealings.</P>
<P>And why, be&s;t and deare&s;t of Women, &s;aid I to Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> why would you grieve that I &s;hould endeavour to relieve my&s;elf from a Part of that Burden, with which you Goodne&s;s and Obligations have &s;o greatly oppre&s;&s;ed me? Oh, that it were, that it were in my Power, I cried, and my Hands pre&s;s'd each-other with an involun|tary Ardour, but, it never will, it never can be po&s;&s;ible, for me, to prove the Pa&s;|&s;ion that my Soul has for you and&mdash;there I he&s;itated&mdash;to &s;hew you, I &s;ay, the Love that I have for you, Mrs. <HI>Graves.</HI> You two make my World, and all that I am concern'd for or de&s;ire therein.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="251">
Since that is the Ca&s;e, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> with a Smile and a Tear that gli&s;tened to|gether, if you will admit an equal Pa&s;&s;ion, from one &s;o old as I am, it were pity we &s;hould ever part. Send, my Child, this very Day, and di&s;charge your former Lodgings. The Time that we &s;pend toge|ther can't but be happy, All Cares are le&s;&s;ened by the Society of tho&s;e we love; and our Satisfactions will be doubled by feeling for Each-other.</P>
<P>I did not, at that Time, know the whole Rea&s;on of the Delight with which I accepted this generous Invitation. I &s;ettled at Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI>'s without any formal Agree|ment; and all my little Matters were, di|rectly, brought home.</P>
<P>O, how happy were many &s;ucceeding Days! how, &s;till, more happy, when con|tra&s;ted with the Mi&s;ery that en&s;ued! We &s;pent all the Time together, that Bu&s;ine&s;s and Attention to the Shop would permit; and we grudged every Moment that was &s;pent a&s;under. I related to them a thou|&s;and entertaining Stories, and Pa&s;&s;ages, occa&s;ionally recollected from the Poets and Hi&s;torians of Antiquity. And a &s;ecret Emotion, and inward Ardour for plea&s;ing, gave me, fluently, to inter&s;per&s;e &s;entimen|tal Ob&s;ervations and pertinent Digre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="248" REF="252">more delightful to my Auditory than all my quoted Authorities.</P>
<P>I was, now, daily gathering Health and Strength, to which the Complacence of my Mind greatly contributed; when, one Evening, Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> returned, more de|jected than ordinary. I inquired into the Cau&s;e, with a Solicitude and Countenance that, naturally, expre&s;&s;ed the Intere&s;t I took in her Concerns. Why, my dear Child, &s;ays &s;he, perhaps I have been both impertinent and indi&s;creet, but I meant all for the be&s;t. You mu&s;t know, then, that I have been on a Vi&s;it to your Father. To my Father, Madam! Even &s;o. I would to Heaven, that he were worthy to be called Father to &s;uch a Son. But, as I was &s;aying.</P>
<P>Your Father, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> is in great Circum&s;tances; he keeps his Coach, has taken a fine new Hou&s;e, and lives at a high Rate. I &s;ent in my Name, with No|tice that I came to him on Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence. I was, thereupon, &s;hewn to a back Parlour, where he &s;at, in Compa|ny with Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> and a lu&s;ty ill look|ing young Gentleman; but, your Step|mother has a comely and good humoured Countenance; &s;he al&s;o appears to be far advanced in her Pregnancy. Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> &s;aid your Father, take a Seat. What are
<PB N="249" REF="253">your Commands with me, Madam? I came, Sir, to let you know that your Son, Mr. <HI>Hammel Clement,</HI> the be&s;t of human Beings, has been on the Point of Death. Have you nothing to &s;ay to me, Madam, but what concerns my Son <HI>Hammel?</HI> I have not, I confe&s;s, Sir, but that is more than enough; it is very intere&s;ting and af|fecting, and concerns you mo&s;t nearly. Here, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> for I will never more call him by the &s;acred Name of Father, here, I &s;ay, he &s;tarted up, and, catching at a Book, he pre&s;s'd it to his Lips, and cried, I &s;wear by the Virtue of this and all other holy Books, that I will never li&s;|ten to any Per&s;on who would &s;peak a &s;ingle Word in Behalf of <HI>Hammel Clement,</HI> and &s;o, Mrs. give me leave to &s;hew you the way out again. So &s;aying, he caught my Hand and drew me to the Door, while I turn|ed, and cried to your Stepmother, O Ma|dam, what &s;ort of a Heart is yours, that refu&s;es its Interce&s;&s;ion on this Occa&s;ion? but &s;he gave me an Eye and Sneer, of &s;uch a mi&s;chievous Meaning, as expre&s;&s;ed the whole Fiend under the Gui&s;e of an Angel. When Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had taken me to the outward Door, I ju&s;t turned, and &s;aid, I am &s;orry, Sir, that a Man, of your grave and &s;en&s;ible Appearance, &s;hould &s;uf|fer your&s;elf to be &s;o duped, by People who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to deceive you. But, &s;welling into Choler, he gave me a violent
<PB N="250" REF="254">Pu&s;h from him, and clapped to the Door in my Face. So that, in &s;hort, my dear Child, I fear I have done you Harm, where I meant you true Service.</P>
<P>It matters not, my Mother, &s;aid I, (en|deavouring to &s;uppre&s;s a Tear of tender Re&s;entment) I will &s;oon, I tru&s;t, procure &s;ome kind of Independence on that <HI>Barba|rian</HI> and his Fortune; and, while I have you and your <HI>Arabella,</HI> I &s;hall want neither Father nor Friend.</P>
<P>Being, now, very nearly, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in my Health, I &s;et out again, in &s;earch after &s;ome Employment that might &s;uit me. As I was &s;trolling, on <HI>Tower Hill,</HI> I ob&s;erved a Shop on my left Hand; it was that of Mr. <HI>Wellcot,</HI> a Book&s;eller and Printer. I &s;tepped in, and, after &s;ome introductory Di&s;cour&s;e, I a&s;ked him if he had Occa&s;ion, in the way of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, for a Friend of mine; a Gentleman, in Di&s;tre&s;s, but of Parts and Learning. Alas, Sir, cried <HI>Wellcot,</HI> &s;uch Creatures, as you mention, are a Drug upon Earth; there is a Glut of them in all Markets. I would give any one a broad Piece <HI>per</HI> Man who &s;hould deliver me from three or four of them, who lie heavy on my Hands. Not, Sir, that they are greedy, or idle, in the lea&s;t. I can get one of the&s;e Gentlemen, as you are plea&s;ed to call them, on who&s;e
<PB N="251" REF="255">Education more Money has been expend|ed than, at the common and legal Intere&s;t, would maintain a decent Family, to the End of the World, I can get one of them, I &s;ay, to labour, like a hackney Hor&s;e, from Morning to Night, at le&s;s Wages than I could hire a ra&s;cally Porter, or Shoe Boy, for three Hours. I employ them, occa&s;ionally, in correcting the Pre&s;s, or folding, or &s;titching the Sheets, or run|ing of Errands. But then, Sir, they have, all of them, A&s;pects, of &s;uch a bilcous De&s;pondence, that a Man may, with le&s;s Melancholy, behold a Death's Head. And really, Sir, I could not &s;tand it, if Cu&s;tom, as I may &s;ay, did not harden me by the perpetual Vi&s;ion of the&s;e Spectres.</P>
<P>While <HI>Wellcot,</HI> was &s;peaking, I made a &s;ecret Vow again&s;t having any kind of Commerce or Concern, with Book&s;ellers or Printers, for, at lea&s;t, a Century to come. But, fearing to be &s;u&s;pected as a Party concerned, I affected an Air, as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, and, ob&s;erving &s;ome Females, who were bu&s;y in &s;titching Pamphlets, I a&s;ked him if they contained any Thing new or entertaining.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid <HI>Wellcot,</HI> this is an elaborate Performance of the mo&s;t eminent of our Patriot Writers; I pay him, at the lowe&s;t, five Guineas, weekly. And, could any
<PB N="252" REF="256">Man write, with double his Spirit and Ge|nius, I could better afford to give that Author an Hundred. For, good Writings are like Diamonds, that are valued, ac|cording to their Carrats; do but double their Weight, and they, immediately be|come of twenty Times the E&s;timation.</P>
<P>This Pamphlet con&s;i&s;ted of a Sheet, &s;ewed in blew Paper. I in&s;tantly, paid my two-pence, and &s;at down to peru&s;e it, I found that it contained &s;everal very free Remon&s;trances, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and the Mini&s;ters, for joining with <HI>France</HI> in the War again&s;t <HI>Holland,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the civil and religious Intere&s;ts of <HI>England.</HI> Together, with a few collateral Digre&s;&s;i|ons, in A&s;&s;ertion of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> of the Freedom of Man, in general; and of <HI>Bri|tons,</HI> in particular. I perceived that it was written with much more Judgment than Genius. And what, &s;aid I to <HI>Wellcot,</HI> will you give to that Man who &s;hall, con|fe&s;&s;edly, excel this your mo&s;t eminent of Patriot Writers, upon his own Subject, and in his own Way? Give Sir? Cried the Book&s;eller, many Thanks, and a proporti|onable Encrea&s;e of Profits. Enough, Sir, I an&s;wered, you &s;hall &s;oon hear from me again. I wi&s;h you a good Morrow.</P>
<P>On my Return, I called at Mr. <HI>Good|ville</HI>'s, but he had &s;ailed for <HI>France,</HI> about
<PB N="253" REF="257">a Fortnight before. I, then, went about to a Number of Pamphlet-Shops, and bought up all the political Papers that had any Reference to the Matter in Hand.</P>
<P>I &s;at down to my Work, like a hungry Man to his Victuals; and I grudged my Heart tho&s;e &s;hort Indulgencies, which it enjoy'd in the Society of the two Objects of its fonde&s;t Affections.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my fir&s;t Paper, in a|bout a Fortnight, I entitled it the WEEK|LY MONITOR, and took it directly to <HI>Wellcot</HI>'s. Here, Sir, &s;aid I, is my Friend's fir&s;t Venture. But, has your Friend, de|manded <HI>Wellcot,</HI> in a di&s;couraging Accent, &s;ent the u&s;ual Indemnity for the fir&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ion of a young Author? That &s;hall not be wanting, I an&s;wered, if you require it, Mr. <HI>Wellcot.</HI> Why, &s;aid he, I do not take upon me to be a Judge in the&s;e Matters; and yet, Cu&s;tom has given me a &s;hrewd &s;ort of a Gue&s;s. Come, Sir, I have a few Minutes to throw away, and they are, at your Service.</P>
<P>He, then, &s;at down, and, having read about a Dozen Lines, Ay, ay! &s;ays he, they don't, always, do thus at <HI>New|market;</HI> your Friend, I find, has &s;et out at the Top of his Speed. Going on, &s;ome|thing
<PB N="254" REF="258">further, he cried, well &s;upported by &mdash;! and, then, proceeding to the third Page, this, &s;ays he, mu&s;t have been &s;tollen from one of the Ancients, becau&s;e there is no modern who could write like it. Well, Sir, you need not give your&s;elf further Trouble, for the pre&s;ent. I will print this fir&s;t Paper at my own Suit. De&s;ire your Friend to be careful about the Second. Call to me, in a Week, and, I think I &s;hall be able to tell you &s;omething that will plea&s;e you.</P>
<P>How diligent is Expectation, how ele|vated is Hope! I returned with the Fea|thers of <HI>Mercury</HI> at my Heels. I &s;et a|bout my &s;econd Paper, with double Ge|nius and Application. My Ideas were more expanded, my Spirits more &s;ublimed. All the Per&s;ua&s;ives of <HI>Cicero;</HI> all the Thunder of <HI>Demo&s;thenes;</HI> all that I had read, on the Topic of Liberty, in popu|lar Governments, or Common-wealths, oc|curred to my Remembrance.</P>
<P>I fini&s;hed my &s;econd E&s;&s;ay, within the Week. I went with it to <HI>Wellcot,</HI> and he pre&s;ented me, at Sight, with twenty Gui|neas. It is more, &s;aid he, than hitherto comes to your Share; but, I love to en|courage, and I tru&s;t that, in the Run, I &s;hall not be a Lo&s;er. I &s;ell this Pam|phlet for two Pence. Nearly two Fourths
<PB N="255" REF="259">thereof go to Printing, Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> another Fourth I re&s;erve, as an Equivalent for my Application and Knowledge in this Way; and, the Remainder is a Redundance which, on extraordinary Tides, ought to flow to the Writer. The Demand, for this Paper, has been very uncommon; and, by what I can judge, the Sale may, in Time, amount to twelve Thou&s;and. You need not, Sir, be a&s;hamed to ac|knowledge your&s;elf the Author. Pre&s;erve but a Moiety of the Spirit, of this <HI>Elijah,</HI> with which you have &s;et out, and my own Intere&s;ts will in&s;truct me to &s;erve you ef|fectually.</P>
<P>I now returned, as in a triumphal Cha|riot. I never, before, received the Prize, as I may &s;ay, of per&s;onal Prowe&s;s. The Fortune of my Father, the Fortune of all Men living, who were merely born to Fortune, dimini&s;hed beneath me. O, how &s;weet, &s;aid I, to my&s;elf, how delicious are the Fruits of a Man's own Plantation! Then, like the &s;agacious and independent Spider, his Labours will be crowned, with per&s;onal Honour and Succe&s;s, while he &s;pins his Sub&s;i&s;tance from his proper Bow|els. It is then, and then only, that a Man may be &s;aid to be the true Proprietor of What he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; and the Value is en|deared, and the Enjoyment doubled there|by.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="260">
I ha&s;tened to impart my Tran&s;ports to the two loved Objects of all my Cares and Satisfactions. <HI>Jenny</HI> told me that her Mi&s;tre&s;s was not at Home, but, that Mi&s;s <HI>Arabella</HI> was above in her Clo&s;et. I ran up. I tapped at the Door, but no one an|&s;wered. Again I tapped, and added the &s;oft Voice of Affection, reque&s;ting to be admitted. At length &s;he opened, but looked pale, and with &s;wollen and down|ca&s;t Eyes. I perceived &s;he had been in Tears, and a &s;udden Fro&s;t fell upon all my Delights. What is the Matter Mi&s;s, I cried, my Si&s;ter, my &s;weet Friend, my deare&s;t <HI>Arabella;</HI> and I gently took her Hand between both of mine. I wi&s;h you had not come, at this Time, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, coolly. But, you mu&s;t permit me to keep my little Griefs to my&s;elf. Yes, I replied, if it is your Plea&s;ure to torture, to kill me outright, refu&s;e me my Portion in your Intere&s;ts and Concerns. O, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, your Soul is too generous, I dare not tell you. I feel what you would &s;uffer, &s;hould you know that you are concerned in the Cau&s;e of my Tears. But, we mu&s;t part, Sir, in|deed, we mu&s;t; we mu&s;t part, Mr. <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> and that &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>Here, her Voice failed, and, throwing her&s;elf into a Chair, &s;he bur&s;t out afre&s;h,
<PB N="257" REF="261">into a Gu&s;h of Affliction. While I &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed; and, dropping be&s;ide her on one Knee, awaited, with un&s;peakable An|gui&s;h, the Su&s;pen&s;ion of her Grief.</P>
<P>At length perceiving my Situation, ri&s;e Sir, &s;he cried, I entreat you to ri&s;e and take a Chair be&s;ide me; and I will tell you, as fa&s;t as I can, of this di&s;tre&s;sful Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that I was, a while ago, to the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es.</HI> They are very friendly, and good young Women, and told me, in Confidence, tho' with much Concern, of a Whi&s;per, in the Neighbourhood, that my Aunt had enter|tained a young Gentleman, in the Hou&s;e, who was admitted to &s;uch familiar and convenient Intimacies as could not, at all Times, be without their Con&s;equence, e&s;pecially, between Per&s;ons of our Age and Sex.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> I am no way a&s;ham|ed to confe&s;s that I have nothing in Hea|ven but my Innocence, nor on Earth but my Character; and, I think you wi&s;h me better, than to de&s;ire that I &s;hould forfeit the one, or the other. De&s;ire it! O Hea|vens! I &s;uddenly exclaimed, I will for ever guard them both, to the la&s;t Drop of my Blood, and la&s;t Breath of my Life. Alas,
<PB N="258" REF="262">cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> you are the Man, of all others, whom the World would not admit for my Champion, in this Ca&s;e; they are ab&s;olute Judges, they ought to be obeyed, our Parting will be painful, but it mu&s;t be complyed with.</P>
<P>But, my Si&s;ter, my <HI>Arabella,</HI> mo&s;t love|ly and mo&s;t beloved of all the Human Species; tell me, &s;ays I, my Angel, is there no other Way, no Expedient to &s;a|tisfy a mi&s;deeming World, &s;ave a Remedy that is wor&s;e than Death it&s;elf? No, &s;aid &s;he, with an Air &s;omewhat re&s;olute and exalted, there is no other Expedient, at lea&s;t, no other, to which I can con&s;ent. O, Mi&s;s <HI>Graves,</HI> an&s;wered I, with a ha&s;ty Dejection, if that is the Ca&s;e, you &s;hall be obeyed; I am, indeed, very unhappy, but I will not be importunate, Adieu, deare&s;t of Creatures, adieu, for ever! I &s;poke, and &s;uddenly withdrew, and gave her, as I imagined, the la&s;t farewel Look.</P>
<P>Hold, Sir, &s;he cried, pray &s;tay a Mo|ment. I &s;hould be wretched, beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, if you went away in the greate&s;t of all Errors. But, is it po&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould think that I could mean any Slight to you, Mr. <HI>Clement?</HI> No, Sir, no, of all Men living, indeed, it was not po&s;&s;ible. I &s;poke, through an humble Sen&s;e of my own Demerits; my Determination was
<PB N="259" REF="263">ju&s;t, I do not repent me of it. I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps, Sir, I have not under&s;tood you&mdash;Indeed I &s;carce know what I &s;ay or mean, my&s;elf&mdash;Of this however be a&s;&s;ured, that I neither do, nor ever did, nor ever can, mean any Offence to Mr. <HI>Clement.</HI></P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke I had kneeled before her. I took her Hand and pre&s;s'd it to my Lips and Bo&s;om. My <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;aid I, I confe&s;s that this was no premeditated Mo|tion of mine. Nay, this very Morning, the World &s;hould not have prevailed with me to have accepted this Hand, for which I now kneel. I was, then, poor and wretched, without Re&s;ource. And, I could not think of bringing Di&s;tre&s;s upon her, independent of who&s;e Happine&s;s I could have no Enjoyment. I was &s;en&s;ible that I loved you, with infinite Tenderne&s;s, with un&s;peakable Ardour; but, my Pa&s;&s;ion did not dare to admit of De&s;ire. I could have &s;uffered all Things to have heaped Ble&s;&s;ings upon you; but I would not per|mit to my Soul the di&s;tant, though dear Wi&s;h, of being happy with you&mdash;Ah, what Po&s;ture is this! exclaimed <HI>Arabella.</HI> Nay, you &s;hall not &s;tir, I cried, nor will I ri&s;e till you have heard me a few Words. Since Morning, I &s;ay, I have got Room to hope that my <HI>Arabella</HI> would not be &s;o unhappy, as I feared, in being united to
<PB N="260" REF="264">me. I will not urge her however. I leave her free, I leave her Mi&s;tre&s;s of her own Will and Actions. But, here I vow to Heaven, that whether &s;he live or die, con&s;ent, or not con&s;ent, I will never mar|ry another. I am, from this Moment, her Wedded for Eternity, the faithful and fond Hu&s;band of her Image and Remembrance.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I ro&s;e and &s;eated my&s;elf be|&s;ide her. She looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and af|fected beyond the Power of Utterance. But, covering her Face with a Handker|chief, &s;he gently leaned toward me, and &s;hed a plenteous Shower of Tears upon my Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> returned, I told her of my extraordinary Succe&s;s at the Book|&s;ellers, I had, before, made her the Trea|&s;urer of my little Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and I poured my twenty Pieces into her Lap.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella,</HI> as I conjectured, did not delay to impart, to her Aunt, the late Adven|ture; for I ob&s;erved that the Eyes of that good Woman, dwelt upon me with a fre&s;h Acce&s;&s;ion of Fondne&s;s and Delight.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my third Paper, I took it to <HI>Wellcot,</HI> who pre&s;ented me with twenty Guineas, and, further, acknow|ledged him&s;elf my Debtor. Returning
<PB N="261" REF="265">homeward, I ca&s;t up, in a plea&s;ing kind of mental Arithmetic, how much my weekly twenty Guineas would amout to at the Years End, and found it much be|yond my Occa&s;ions, even in the State of Matrimony.</P>
<P>I now looked upon my&s;elf, as in the certain Receit of a plentiful Income; and this encouraged me to pre&s;s for the Com|pletion of my Happine&s;s. Decency, alone, could give Difficulty or Delay, in an Af|fair that was, equally, the Wi&s;h of all Parties. We were privately married, in the Pre&s;ence of the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es</HI> and two or three other Neighbours; and I was put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the blu&s;hinge&s;t, fearfulle&s;t, and fonde&s;t of all Brides.</P>
<P><HI>Job,</HI> very ju&s;tly, &s;ays, <HI>&s;hall we receive Good at the Hands of God and not receive Evil?</HI> And yet, I imagine, that the Re|collection, of pa&s;t Happine&s;s, rather heigh|tens than alleviates the Sen&s;e of pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s. My Soul, in tho&s;e Days, enjoy|ed a Tide of Delight, to the Fullne&s;s of its Wi&s;hes, and to the Stretch of its Capa|city. I thought that, till then, no Per&s;on had ever loved, as I loved. But the Love, of my <HI>Arabella,</HI> was a kind of Pa&s;&s;ion, that wanted a new Name whereby to expre&s;s it. It was an Ab&s;ence, a &s;ort of Death to all other Objects. It was a Plea&s;ure too
<PB N="262" REF="266">paining, a di&s;tre&s;sful Attention, the Ava|rice of a Mi&s;er who watches over his Hoard, and joins to the Rapture, with which he beholds it, the terrifying Ideas of Robbery and Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I had now, within the Space of five Weeks, received about one hundred and twenty Guineas, on the Sale of my Moni|tor. When, going abroad, one Evening, I was &s;topped, within a few Doors of my Hou&s;e, by a genteel looking Per&s;on who a&s;ked if my Name was <HI>Clement,</HI> it is, Sir, I an&s;wered. Then Sir, &s;ays he, I arre&s;t you, in his Maje&s;ty's Name, for Sedition and a Libel again&s;t the Government. Then, beckoning to three or four Ser|jeants, that attended, he had me directly &s;eized and conveyed toward <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>As I was not of a timorous Temper, nor con&s;cious of the &s;malle&s;t Tincture of the Crimes with which I was charged, I &s;hould have made little more than a Je&s;t of this Bu&s;ine&s;s; had I not trembled for the Apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e who I knew would tremble for me.</P>
<P>On the Way, this Officer informed me, that my Book&s;eller had betrayed me, and had confe&s;&s;ed, to the Mini&s;ters, that I was the Author of a famous Pamphlet, entitled the WEEKLY MONITOR. Be|ing
<PB N="263" REF="267">delivered to the Keeper, I put a few Pieces into his Hand, and was conducted to a decent Apartment, con&s;idering the Place.</P>
<P>I immediately &s;ent for <HI>Humphrey Cypher,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Serjeant at Law, whom I had, once, occa&s;ionally feed in behalf of Mrs. <HI>Graves;</HI> and I &s;ent, at the &s;ame Time, for a Set of the WEEKLY MONITOR. When Mr. <HI>Cypher</HI> came, I put five Pieces into his Hand, and, having told him my Ca&s;e, I reque&s;ted him to peru&s;e the Papers in que&s;tion, and to give me his Opinion thereon.</P>
<P>Having read them, with due Attention; Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I perceive that you are a learned and ingenious young Gentle|man; but I find that you are better ac|quainted with the Republics of <HI>Greece,</HI> than with the Nature and Con&s;titution of our limited Monarchy. Hence, alone, hath proceeded &s;ome Lap&s;es, and Mi&s;ap|plications, that your Adver&s;aries would lay hold of. Yet, there is nothing, gro&s;sly, &s;currilous or malicious, throughout; nor what may amount to the incurring of a Praemunire, by the mo&s;t violent Con&s;traint or Wre&s;ting of the Sen&s;e. If you are in|clined, &s;ays he, to proceed in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Papers, I would advi&s;e you to put in Bail, and to &s;tand the Action. But,
<PB N="264" REF="268">as I am per&s;uaded that the Court have commenced this Pro&s;ecution as a Matter, merely <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to deter you from a Work that gives them great Di&s;gu&s;t, if you have any genteel Friend, who would &s;olicit in your Favour, and promi&s;e a fu|ture Conduct, more amenable to Power, you would, undoubtedly be di&s;charged, without further Co&s;t or Trouble.</P>
<P>I returned my warm Acknowledgments to the Serjeant for his friendly Coun&s;el, and told him I would con&s;ider of it, be|fore I gave him further Trouble. When he was gone, I di&s;patched a Letter to Mrs. <HI>Graves,</HI> wherein I gave her an Ac|count of my pre&s;ent Situation, in a Man|ner, as little alarming as po&s;&s;ible. I re|que&s;ted her to provide Bail for my Ap|pearance at Bar; but in&s;i&s;ted that, till this was done, neither &s;he nor <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;hould come to my Pri&s;on; and, that I had given expre&s;s Orders that they &s;hould not be admitted.</P>
<P>Alas! had they complyed with my Di|rections, how happy might we have been, all together, at this Day. But, the Exce&s;s of their Goodne&s;s was the Cau&s;e of our common Ruin. Their Affection would not be &s;atisfied with &s;imple Bail; and they re&s;olved never to re&s;t, till they had pro|cured my full Di&s;charge.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="269">
They went about to all their Cu&s;tomers of any Di&s;tinction. They &s;olicited, petiti|oned, and bribed without Mea&s;ure. They borrowed Money to the utmo&s;t Extent of their Credit; and pawned, or &s;old all their Effects under prime Co&s;t. They gave a Pur&s;e to one, to bring them acquainted with another, on whom they be&s;towed a larger Sum, to introduce them to a third. Having, at length, made their Way to Lord <HI>Stivers,</HI> an Agent of the Mini&s;ter, he thought he &s;aw an Advantage in granting their Reque&s;t, and my Di&s;charge was made out, without further Delay.</P>
<P>On the fifth Evening from my Impri|&s;onment, the Door of my Chamber open|ed, and, in came my dear Aunt with my dearer <HI>Arabella.</HI> They flew upon me; they cla&s;ped me, on each Side, in their Arms; and my Wife, in&s;tantly, &s;wooned away upon my Bo&s;om. She &s;oon revived, however, at the known Voice of Love, and, as every Door for my Enlargement had been previou&s;ly opened, we went down, &s;tepped into the Coach, and drove home, directly.</P>
<P>Here, I &s;aw the fir&s;t Subject and Cau&s;e of Alarm. The Shop was &s;hut up. I was &s;hocked and felt a &s;udden Chilne&s;s
<PB N="266" REF="270">come upon me; but did not venture to inquire, except by my Eyes.</P>
<P>The Kettle being down, and all &s;eated to Tea, I introduced the Affair, with an affected Unconcern; and, by Que&s;tion af|ter Que&s;tion, artfully extracted, from my Companions, the whole Hi&s;tory and Ad|ventures of the five preceding Days; whereby, I found that they had expended in my Behalf beyond the la&s;t Penny of their own Sub&s;tance; and that nothing remained, &s;ave one hundred and fifty Pounds, to which the &s;everal Depo&s;its a|mounted, which I had made with Mrs. <HI>Graves.</HI></P>
<P>I could now no longer contain my&s;elf. Cruel Women, inhuman Friends! I cried. The Bitterne&s;s of Enmity, the Rancour of Malice could never have brought an Evil, like this, upon me. Accur&s;ed Wretch that I am, ordained to be the In&s;trument of Perdition to tho&s;e, whom I would feed with my Blood and fo&s;ter with my Vitals. Would to Heaven I had not been born! or, would I had been cut off by &s;ome quick and horrid Judgment ere this had happened!</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>Graves</HI> drew her Chair clo&s;e to mine, and catching me about the Neck, and dropping upon me a few Tears, that
<PB N="267" REF="271">&s;he &s;truggled to &s;uppre&s;s; don't grieve, my Child, &s;he cried, don't afflict your&s;elf for nothing. All is as it &s;hould be. There is no Harm done. Your <HI>Arabella</HI> and I can always earn genteel and inde|pendent Bread, without Shop or other Means than the Work of our Hands. We can never want, my <HI>Hammy.</HI> We have done nothing for you. Neither has any Thing happened wherewith you ought to reproach your&s;elf. What we did was for our&s;elves, for the Relief of the Angui&s;h of our own Hearts; to bring you home to us, again, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble, my Son, &s;ince we found that we could live no longer without you.</P>
<P>Within a few Days, I perceived that my dear Aunt began to decline in her Health, perhaps, occa&s;ioned by her late Fatigue and Anxiety of Spirits. I brought an able Phy&s;ician to her, but, he could form no Judgment of the Nature of her Di&s;order, till, &s;ome Time a&s;ter, when her Complexion began to change, and the Doctor declared her to be in the Jaundice. He began to apply the cu&s;tomary Medi|cines, and, no Care nor Expence was &s;par|ed for her Recovery. <HI>Arabella</HI> and I &s;at up with her, alternately, ev'ry Night; and, all the Day, we read to her &s;ome Book of Amu&s;ement, in order to di&s;&s;ipate the Melancholy of her Di&s;ea&s;e. But, alas,
<PB N="268" REF="272">all our Cares and Remedies; our Attention and Solicitude, our Prayers and our Tears, proved, equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, and, at the End of five Months, &s;he expired within our Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> then quitted her Hold, and, cro&s;&s;ing her Arms upon her Bo&s;om, and looking, eagerly, on the Face, once &s;o lovely, and always boloved; you are then at Peace, &s;aid &s;he, my Mother. O Death, had&s;t thou not enough of Terrors, in thy A&s;pect, without adding to thy Agonies tho&s;e of tearing from us that which we prized above Life. O my Friend! my on|ly Parent! my deare&s;t deare&s;t Mother! &mdash; She could no more, but, immediately, fainted away upon the Body.</P>
<P>I took her up in my Arms, and, car|rying her into the next Room, I laid her on the Bed; I ordered <HI>Jenny</HI> and the two Nur&s;ekeepers to take Care of her Recove|ry, and charged them not to permit her to &s;ee her Aunt, any more.</P>
<P>I, then, returned to the Chamber, wherein, the precious Ruins of the Half of my World was laid. I locked the Door within &s;ide. I approached the Body, and, hung over it, and gazed upon it, with in|expre&s;&s;ible Emotion. I repeatedly clapped my Hands together. I &s;tooped down, and
<PB N="269" REF="273">ki&s;&s;ed, and reki&s;&s;ed her cold Lips, in an Agony of Affection. I gave a free Scope to my Tears, Sobs, and Lamentations. Ah, I cried, my Parent; my Patrone&s;s; ah, Mother to the Son of your unhappy Election! Have I lo&s;t you, my only Prop? Are you, for ever, departed from me, my Support and Con&s;olation? I was aban|doned by the World, by Friends, Father, and Relations; but you became the World and all Relations to me. <HI>I was a Stranger, and you took me in; I was &s;ick, and in Pri&s;on, and you mini&s;tered unto me.</HI> But, you are gone, you are gone from me, afar off. And I, die a thou&s;and Deaths in the Angui&s;h of &s;urviving you. Here you lie, my Mother, the Victim of your Good|ne&s;s to your unlucky Gue&s;t. Wretch that I am! doom'd to bring no Portion, &s;ave that of Calamity, to tho&s;e who regard me. Woe of Woes! Where, now, &s;hall I ea&s;e my Soul of its in&s;upportable Burden? Of the Debt, with which it labours, to this kind Creature? She will no more return, to take aught at my Hands; and I mu&s;t &s;uffer the Oppre&s;&s;ion, through Life, and through Eternity.</P>
<P>Having thus vented the Exce&s;&s;es of my Pa&s;&s;ion, my Spirits &s;ub&s;ided into a kind of gloomy Calm, I returned to my Wife. &mdash; But, I &s;ee, Sir, you are too much
<PB N="270" REF="274">affected. I will not dwell on this melan|choly Scene any longer.</P>
<P>When I had di&s;charged Doctor's Fees, Apothecaries Bills, and Funeral Expences; I found that our Fortune did not amount to fifty Pounds. My Wife was, now, far advanced in her Pregnancy; her Labour was ha&s;tened by her Grief and late Fa|tigues; and &s;he was delivered of that Boy whom your Charity, a &s;econd Time, brought into this World.</P>
<P>As I was, now, all Things, to my <HI>Aro|bella;</HI> the only Con&s;olation &s;he had upon Earth, I never left her during her Illne&s;s. By the Time &s;he was up and about; what with the Charges of Child bearing, and a Quarter's Rent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> our Fund was, again, &s;unk within the Sum of ten Pounds; and I was going, one Evening, to look out for &s;ome Employment when we heared a Rap|ping of Di&s;tinction at the Door.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> came, in a hurry, and brought us word that Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> was in the Par|lour, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. I went down, greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;ome|thing alarmed at his Vi&s;it. Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, with a familiar Air, I have long wi&s;hed to &s;ee you, but I did not think it &s;ea&s;onable to di&s;turb you, during the Mi&s;|fortune of your Family and the Illne&s;s of
<PB N="271" REF="275">your Wife. Your WEEKLY MONI|TORS have Genius and Spirit, but they have done &s;ome Mi&s;chief which we wi&s;h to have remedied. As how, pray, my Lord? Why, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> I never knew a Wri|ting, in favour of Liberty, or again&s;t any Mea&s;ures of Government, which the Po|pulace did not wre&s;t, in favour of Licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, and to the ca&s;ting a&s;ide of all Manner of Rule. Now, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> we want you to undertake our Cau&s;e, which is, by much, the more rea&s;onable and or|derly Side of the Argument; in &s;hort, we want you to refute your own Papers.</P>
<P>O, my Lord, I an&s;wered, I &s;hould think it an Honour to &s;erve your Lord&s;hip or the Mini&s;try, on any other Occa&s;ion. But, in a Matter that mu&s;t bring public Infamy upon me; indeed, my Lord, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me. I &s;hould be pointed at, as an Apo&s;tate and Pro&s;titute, by all Men, and bring my Per&s;on and Writings into &s;uch Di&s;grace as would, for ever, di&s;able me from &s;erving either my&s;elf, or your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Well Sir, replied my Lord, I will not, then, in&s;i&s;t on a formal Refutation of your own Writings. I only a&s;k, if you are willing to engage in our Quarrel, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with Honour and Truth? I
<PB N="272" REF="276">am, my Lord, I rejoined, as far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with my own Credit and the Good of my Country.</P>
<P>The Good of your Country, Mr. <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, I hope you do not think that Government is contrary to the Good of your Country. Pray, in what do you make this LIBERTY con&s;i&s;t, of which you are become &s;o eminent a Patron?</P>
<P>There are two Sorts of LIBERTY, my Lord, I an&s;wered. The fir&s;t con&s;titutes the Duty and Happine&s;s of a Man, inde|pendent of Community. The &s;econd con|&s;titutes the Privilege and Happine&s;s of a Man, merely, as he is a Member of any State or Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Independent of Community, a Man is &s;o far free and no further, than he acts up to the Dictates of Rea&s;on and Duty, in de&s;pight of inward Appetite and out|ward Influence.</P>
<P>As a Member of Community, a Man is, &s;o far, free, and no further than as every other Member, of that Community, is le|gally re&s;trained from injuring his Per&s;on, or encroaching on his Property.</P>
<P>Inimitably well definded, cried his Lord|&s;hip; I have read Volumes, in Folio, upon
<PB N="273" REF="277">the Subject; but, never knew what LI|BERTY was before. Well, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> as this LIBERTY of yours, is in all Re|&s;pects, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s I was talking of; it cannot but make, mainly, in Favour of good Government. I therefore reque&s;t you to write a Treati&s;e to the Purpo&s;e of your Definition; and to take us with you, as far as you can. We &s;hall not be ungrateful, we are good Pay|ma&s;ters, Sir. Why do you he&s;itate? Did you not tell me you were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve us?</P>
<P>My Lord, I replied, I fear I &s;hould fall greatly &s;hort of your Expectations. I am not &s;tudied in the Con&s;titution of modern States; and, how &s;hould I be able to ju&s;ti|fy any Government, with re&s;pect to Mea|&s;ures that, perhaps, are a Secret to all, except the Mini&s;ters? I mu&s;t further ob|&s;erve, to your Lord&s;hip, that my former Field would be greatly contracted, on this Occa&s;ion. It is very ea&s;y and obvious to find Fault and to call in Que&s;tion; but, to vindicate Truth it&s;elf again&s;t popular Prejudice, <HI>hoc Opus hic Labor e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, I am proud that we have got a Gentleman of &s;o much Hone&s;ty and Ingenuity to befriend us. It &s;hall be my Care to provide you with Ma|terials, and, I am confident that &s;o great
<PB N="274" REF="278">a Ma&s;ter of his In&s;trument, as you are, will make excellent Mu&s;ic on a few fun|damental Notes. Here are twenty Gui|neas Earne&s;t, and ten Guineas &s;hall be pay'd you, weekly, till we can fix you in &s;ome Station of due Honour and Advan|tage. I will take a Gla&s;s, or a Di&s;h of Tea with you, in a few Days, and wi&s;h you a good Evening.</P>
<P>On the third Morning after this Inter|view, my Lord returned with a large Bun|dle of <HI>Anti-Patria</HI> Pamphlets, in his Cha|riot, and &s;ome manu&s;cript Notes and Hints for my In&s;truction. He breakfa&s;ted with us, and was ea&s;y, polite, and chearful.</P>
<P>I now entered on my new Province, but, not with u&s;ual Ardour. As I had, formerly, la&s;hed the In&s;olence, Encroach|ments, and Rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of Power, le&s;s ambitious of Conque&s;t, over Aliens and Enemies, than over the very People it was ordained to protect: I now, on the other Hand, rebuked, with like Acrimony, the riotous, factious, and &s;editious Propen&s;ities, of a turbulent, licentious, and un&s;atisfied People; ever repugnant to Government, and reluctant to the Rein of the gentle&s;t Ruler. I proved, from many Authorities, and In&s;tances, derived from <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> that Power is never &s;o dangerous to a Populace as when it is taken into their
<PB N="275" REF="279">own Hands. That the Governors and governed, by the Violence of Colli&s;ion, are apt to fly to Extremes, on either Side. That Anarchy is the mo&s;t direct, of all Roads, to Tyranny. And that a People, who have no Will to be governed, reduce them&s;elves to the Nece&s;&s;ity, of being cru&s;h'd, in&s;ulted, and governed, whether they will or no.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, though I, thus alternately, &s;ided with the People again&s;t Power, and with Power again&s;t the People; yet I &s;truck at nothing but Faults, on either Hand; and equally a&s;&s;erted, on both Sides of the Que&s;tion, the Cau&s;e of my Coun|try, of Liberty, and Truth.</P>
<P>I took five Times the Pains with the&s;e latter Papers that I had with the For|mer, and yet, I confe&s;s I had not equal Plea&s;ure in the Delivery. I am, al&s;o, per&s;uaded, that the&s;e had more than dou|ble the Merit of the other; and, in Point of Sentiment, Moral, and general In&s;truc|tion, were of twenty Times the Value to Mankind: But, how can that in&s;truct which is not attended to? it was intimated to the People that the&s;e had been written at the In&s;tance of their Governors; and they would not have li&s;tened to an Oracle, if uttered from that Quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="280">
Six Months had now elap&s;ed in the&s;e Lucubrations. I had delivered, to my Wife two hundred and &s;ixty Guineas, the weekly Price of my Labours. We had lived with great Frugality. <HI>Arabella</HI> had, again, taken in as much Work as her Nur&s;ing and Attention to the Child would admit. And we had &s;ome Pieces left of our former Remnant; when Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> called in upon me, with Plea&s;ure and good News, as it were, Prologue in his A&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I want to &s;peak to you, apart. I had, Ye&s;terday, &s;ome Talk with the Mini&s;ter about you, and he has promi&s;ed me four hundred a Year Pen&s;ion for you, till &s;omething better can be done; and this is to be wholly clear and over your weekly Wages of ten Guineas, while we keep you &s;o hard at Work. But, tell me, <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, laying his Hand with an affectio|nate Familiarity upon my Shoulder, are you of a jealous Temper? The furthe&s;t from it, my Lord, of any Man breathing. O, I'm glad of that, but, if you were, I have nothing exceptionable to propo&s;e. To be &s;hort; Half a Dozen of Noblemen, all my Friends, and People of &s;trict Pro|bity and Virtue, have engaged to &s;pend a Share of To-morrow, in a Party of Plea|&s;ure upon the <HI>Thames;</HI> and, we have, each of us, laid a Bet of a hundred
<PB N="277" REF="281">Guineas, that, from the Number of his Relations, his Friends, or Acquaintance, he will bring the prettie&s;t Woman to this Field of Contention. I had fixed on Lady <HI>Fanny Standi&s;h,</HI> a lovely Creature, and a Relation of my own, but &s;he, unfortu|nately, happened to be pre-engaged to one of my Rivals. I am, therefore quite at a Lo&s;s, and mu&s;t, infallibly, lo&s;e my Wager, if you do not favour me with the Company of Mrs. <HI>Clement.</HI> With her I can make no Que&s;tion of Conque&s;t; and I give you my Honour to pour into her Lap, the whole five hundred Guineas, the ju&s;t Prize of her Beauty.</P>
<P>Why, my Lord, I an&s;wered, this is, indeed, a very plea&s;ant Project, and has nothing in it exceptionable, that I can perceive, if no one was to know any Thing of the Matter. But, what will the World &s;ay to &s;ee your Lord&s;hip &s;o pair'd? Shaw, damn the World, <HI>Clement,</HI> I am your World, Man. Your Lord&s;hip has a very good Right to damn an inferior World, I rejoined; but the World has an equal Right, and would, certainly, make u&s;e of it, in the Damnation of my Wife. What, &s;aid he, warmly, you will not, then, confide her to my Friend&s;hip and Honour? I will not, my Lord, confide her Honour, unnece&s;&s;arily, to any Man from under that Guardian&s;hip and Protec|tion
<PB N="278" REF="282">which I vowed to her, in Marriage. It is very well, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> you may hear from me To-morrow. And away he went.</P>
<P>He was as good as his Word. The very next Morning, I was arre&s;ted at his Suit for two hundred and four&s;core Gui|neas, the Amount of all that I had receiv|ed from him; and I was hurried to the <HI>Fleet Pri&s;on,</HI> without being permitted to &s;peak to any one.</P>
<P>As my Lord knew that, on I&s;&s;ue, I mu&s;t ca&s;t him in his Action, and, further, come upon him for &s;pecial Damage and fal&s;e Dure&s;s; it in&s;tantly occurred that this was, merely, a Stratagem for the Seducti|on of my <HI>Arabella;</HI> and her defencele&s;s State gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible Torture. I, immediately wrote her an Account of my Situation and Apprehen&s;ions which, un|happily for all Parties, were too well founded. But, Sir, I will give you a De|tail of the&s;e extraordinary Events, in the Order of Time, in which they happen'd, as I, afterwards, learned them, from the Mouth of my Wife, and from the Te&s;ti|mony of others, on Trial in public Court.</P>
<P>Before my Wife could have the lea&s;t Intelligence of my Confinement, my Lord paid her a Vi&s;it, and, entring with his ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="279" REF="283">Freedom and good Humour, Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I am come to pre|vent your being alarmed, when you &s;hould hear that I &s;ent your Hu&s;band to the <HI>Fleet Pri&s;on</HI> this Morning. But, to convince you that I intend him no manner of Harm; I have, here, brought you the Money for which he was arre&s;ted; and it is at your own Choice to relea&s;e him, within this Hour, or on the Fea&s;t of Saint <HI>Simpleton,</HI> if you are not in a Hurry. So &s;aying, he put a large Pur&s;e into her Hand. And, pray my Lord, then de|manded <HI>Arabella,</HI> on what Account was it that you had him arre&s;ted? To puni&s;h him, an&s;wered my Lord, for being the mo&s;t jealous-pated Coxcomb in Europe. Jealous, my Lord! pray of whom can he be jealous? Of you and I, Madam. Of us, my Lord? Sure we never gave him Cau&s;e. No, that I'll be &s;worn, rejoined my Lord; but more is the Pity; the Jea|lou&s;y came fir&s;t, and the Cau&s;e ought, now, in all Con&s;cience, to follow.</P>
<P>Before the la&s;t Words had e&s;caped his Mouth, he &s;prung forward, and, catching her in his Arms, he pre&s;s'd and ki&s;&s;ed her with the rude&s;t Ardour. But, quickly di&s;engaging her&s;elf, and, pu&s;hing him, violently, from her. I &s;ee you're a Villain, &s;he cried, and de&s;ire that you'll in&s;tantly
<PB N="280" REF="284">quit my Hou&s;e; and, &s;o &s;aying, &s;he threw the Pur&s;e out at the Door. My Lord, however, &s;tood his Ground, and, looking at her with a&s;toni&s;hing Ea&s;e and Uncon|cern; Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, the De&s;tiny of your Hu&s;band and your&s;elf is in my Hands; and I mu&s;t tell you it does not become you to treat your be&s;t Friend in &s;o injurious a Manner. I have, here, brought you a Settlement of five hundred a Year, for Life. It is perfected to you without Condition, and, how far you will be grate|ful, lies, wholly, at your own Election. May Heaven for&s;ake me, &s;he cried, when I accept the &s;malle&s;t Advantage from you or your Fortune. Well, well, <HI>Arabella,</HI> replied my Lord, I mu&s;t and will have you, on your Terms, or my own; but, if you had, really a mind to conte&s;t this Bu&s;ine&s;s with me, what a little Fool you were, &s;o &s;imply, to ca&s;t away the Sinews of War? I leave you, Child, for the pre|&s;ent, to wi&s;er Reflections; then in&s;olently &s;miling in her Face, he retired.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, my Wife hur|ried to the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es,</HI> and prevailed upon one of them to keep her Company till &s;he &s;hould be able to procure my En|largement. She, then, went to a Per&s;on, who dealt in Hou&s;hold Furniture, and re|que&s;ted him to come, the next Morning, and make a Purcha&s;e of &s;ome Goods that
<PB N="281" REF="285">&s;he had to di&s;po&s;e of. And, la&s;tly, &s;he writ me a Letter with an Account of all the&s;e Matters, and a Promi&s;e to be with me the Day following.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have appri&s;ed you before this, that our faithful and affectionate <HI>Jenny</HI> had for&s;aken us. A &s;mall Legacy had been left her, whereupon &s;he quitted Service and went to live with her Parents; and we were obliged to hire a &s;trange Maid in her Room.</P>
<P>The next Day, <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;old as much of her Furniture, to the forementioned Dea|ler and &s;ome Neighbours, as amounted to upward of forty Guineas. She had put the&s;e, with her former Depo&s;it of two hundred and &s;ixty, into her Pocket; it was now Afternoon, and &s;he was joyfully preparing to come and give me Freedom; when our new Maid entered and told Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgins</HI> that a Lady waited for her, at Home, on earne&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, but promi&s;ed not to detain her above five Minutes. Alas! Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgins</HI> was &s;carce gone, when Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> entered, and my Wife, giving a violent Shriek, dropped backward in a Chair.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Stivers,</HI> thereupon, drew another Chair, and, with an impudent Appearance of Tenderne&s;s, &s;eated him&s;elf be&s;ide her.
<PB N="282" REF="286">My dear <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;aid he, don't be alarm|ed. By,&mdash;I am not come to do you the &s;malle&s;t Injury. I tell you, however, that you're wholly in my Power. Your Street Door is bolted. I have two able Footmen below in your Kitchen; and the Maid, who contrived to get your Friend out of the Way, is much more my Servant than yours, I a&s;&s;ure you. I have loved you long, my <HI>Arabella,</HI> and the frequent Vi|&s;its, I pay'd, are to be placed to your Cre|dit, and not to that of the &s;tupid Polities, with which I amu&s;ed your Hu&s;band, and now, my Angel, if you will make any Conce&s;&s;ion, but the &s;lighte&s;t Return to the Exce&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;ion and Fondne&s;s for you; I, here, vow to you perpetual Faith and Con&s;tancy for Life, and, both my Fortune and Per&s;on &s;hall be, wholly, de|voted to you. But, don't attempt to impo&s;e; don't hope to deceive me.</P>
<P>No, no, my Lord, &s;he cried, I will not deceive you, by pretending to &s;acrifice the lea&s;t Article of Duty to your Per&s;on or Fortune. I &s;ee that I'm in Danger; on the Brink of Perdition. I &s;ee that Hell is &s;trong, and &s;ubtle at Devices. Heav'n &s;ave me, any how! &s;trike, &s;tike me dead, this In&s;tant! You Thunders and Earth|quakes, that once were my Terrors, be now my Deliverers!</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="287">
Why, my <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;ays Lord <HI>Stivers,</HI> this is all very &s;ine. It is the &s;weete&s;t Rant I ever hear'd. And you are the &s;weete&s;t Girl, upon my Soul, that ever I &s;aw. I perceive that you are really a|larmed, my Love; but, what is it that frights you, you &s;hall never receive any Treatment from me, &s;ave Proofs of the Fondne&s;s and Violence of my Affection. Recall your Spirits, Child; and prepare your&s;elf, with Patience, for what mu&s;t be. For I &s;wear to you, <HI>Arabella,</HI> by&mdash;<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> that no Power, in the Univer&s;e, &s;hall &s;natch you, this Hour, from the Ardour of my Care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The wretched Object of the Lu&s;t of this barbarous Man, then, dropped upon her Knees in a frantic Agony. O GOD! &s;he cried out, if you are in Heaven, if you hear and &s;ee the&s;e Things. If Virtue and Purity are not an Offence unto you. Send, &s;end, and deliver me by &s;ome &s;udden Sal|vation! O, my Lord, once our generous Patron and Protector, the Friend and Sup|port of our declining Hou&s;e! Would you now tumble into deep and irreparable Ruins, the Work of your own Hands? Alas, you know not what you do; you cannot gue&s;s at the Horrors you are about to perpetrate. If ever you had a touch of Pity. If ever&mdash;but, what &s;hall I &s;ay.
<PB N="284" REF="288">If you do not, like Devils, delight in the Mi&s;eries of Wretches, damn'd for Eter|nity; &s;hield, &s;hield me, my dear Lord; be you, your&s;elf, my Saviour, from this my Hour of Terrors, from this Hell that is come upon me. I have, already, &s;uf|fered the Pangs of Death, in the bare Ap|prehen&s;ion. I will never live to bear in me, and about me, a dete&s;table Being. Hope it not; dream not of it. By Heav'n, I will not a Moment, &s;urvive my Pollu|tion. O Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! And, &s;o &s;aying, her Voice was &s;topped, by an Agony of Sobs and Tears.</P>
<P>Charming Girl! enchanting Creature! exclaimed the deliberate Villain, every Ac|tion, every Word, intended to di&s;&s;uade, are fre&s;h Fuel and Incitement to my Pa&s;|&s;ion for you, my <HI>Arabella.</HI> But, I &s;ee that you will not con&s;ent to my Happine&s;s; and that I mu&s;t give you an Apology, for your Acceptance of any Favour or Fortune at my Hands.</P>
<P>So &s;aying he aro&s;e. And up &s;he &s;prung at the In&s;tant, and running to the furthe&s;t Corner of the Room, recollected all her Spirits and Force for her Defence. She &s;truggled, and &s;hrieked, and called out up|on Heaven, and Earth, to &s;ave her. But, no Help appearing nigh, &s;he, &s;uddenly, recollected a Pair of long and &s;harp pointed
<PB N="285" REF="289">Sci&s;&s;ars that &s;he had, in her Pocket, and, in the Moment that Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> threw her, prone upon the Floor, &s;he drew them forth, and, aiming at him, with all her Strength, &s;he almo&s;t buried the Weapon in his left Side; whereat he gave a loud Cur&s;e, and over he tumbled ga&s;ping, and groveling, be&s;ide her.</P>
<P>Up &s;he got, with all Ha&s;te, and, run|ing to the Cradle where her Infant lay crying, &s;he caught him in her Arms; and, opening the chamber Door, &s;oftly, and &s;hutting it after her, &s;he &s;tepped down Stairs, as upon Feathers, and, &s;tealing to the Street Door, &s;he opened it &s;uddenly, ru&s;hed into the Street, and hurried on till &s;he came to a Stand of Coaches; where &s;he hired the fir&s;t &s;he met, threw her&s;elf ha&s;tily into it, and de&s;ired the Man to drive, with Speed to the Fleet Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>On her Arrival, &s;he di&s;charged the Action and Fees of Arre&s;t, with all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;|patch, and, then, hurried up to my A|partment. On the fir&s;t Glimp&s;e, I &s;prung to her, and caught her in my Arms with un&s;peakable Tran&s;port; but, finding the Child with her, and ob&s;erving that her Breath was quick and uneven, I withdrew a Step or two, and looked eagerly at her; and, perceiving that &s;he was pale, and had
<PB N="286" REF="290">a kind of Wildne&s;s in her Eyes and Mo|tions; what is the Matter, my Love, I cried, what has happened to you? I have not been well, &s;he an&s;wered, with an af|fected unconcern before the Keeper. But, pray come down, my Dear, you are much wanted, and the Coach is in Waiting.</P>
<P>Nothing further pa&s;&s;ed, between us, till we got into the Coach, and that my Wife de&s;ired the Man to drive to &s;ome Neigh|bouring Street, and to &s;top at the fir&s;t Door where he &s;aw a Bill for Lodgings. For Lodgings; again I demanded, for whom does my <HI>Arabella</HI> de&s;ire to take Lodgings? For you and I Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> for you and I, &s;he cried, wringing her Hands together; Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> lies, weltring in his Blood at our Hou&s;e, deprived of Life within this Half Hour, by my unhappy Hand.</P>
<P>I was, &s;uddenly, &s;truck dumb, with Sur|prize and Horror. All the Occa&s;ions and Con&s;equences, of this direful Event, whirl|ed through my Imagination in a fearful Succe&s;&s;ion. What mu&s;t, now, become of my Soul's &s;ole Enjoyment? what Indigni|ties mu&s;t have been offered! what Viola|tion might &s;he not, or, rather, mu&s;t &s;he not have &s;uffered, before &s;he could be brought to perpetrate &s;o terrible a Deed, I grew, in&s;tantly &s;ick, and, putting my Head through the Window, de&s;ired the
<PB N="287" REF="291">Coachman to &s;top at the fir&s;t Tavern. I ordered the Drawer to na&s;ten, with a Pint of Spani&s;h White Wine, to the Door, and I pre&s;&s;ed and compelled my Wife to &s;wal|low a Part. Our Spirits being, in &s;ome Degree, &s;ettled, thereby; we drove to a private Street, on the right Hand of <HI>Cheap|&s;ide,</HI> where I took a back Room and Clo|&s;et, up two Pair of Stairs, at one Mrs. <HI>Jennett</HI>'s, an old Maid and a Mantua-ma|ker. I, immediately, ordered a Fire to be kindled, and the Tea-Things to be laid, and, giving the Servant a Crown, de&s;ired her to bring the Value in proper Ingredi|ents.</P>
<P>The Evening was, now, &s;hut in; and, while the Maid was abroad, not a Syllable pa&s;&s;ed between my Wife and me. I dread|ed to enquire of what I, &s;till, more dread|ed to under&s;tand; and <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;eemed to labour under &s;ome mighty Oppre&s;&s;ion; when, retiring to the Clo&s;et, where our Bed &s;tood, &s;he covered her Child up warm, and, kneeling down by his Side, broke forth into a violent Torrent of Tears, in|termingled with Heavings and Half &s;trang|led Sobs.</P>
<P>I &s;at &s;till, without &s;eeming to ob&s;erve her Emotion. I was &s;en&s;ible that Nature wanted this kindly Relief. The Teas and Sugars were brought; the Kettle put on
<PB N="288" REF="292">the Fire; and the Maid, again, retired; when I, gently, called to my <HI>Arabella</HI> to come forth, with a Voice, of the true&s;t Love, and &s;ofte&s;t Endearment, that ever yet breathed from a human Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Her Eyes were already wiped, her Countenance compo&s;ed, and her Motions and Demeanour much more &s;ettled, than before. She &s;at down with a ri&s;ing Sigh, which &s;he checked with a Half Smile. My <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;aid I, my only Joy! my un|mea&s;ured Ble&s;&s;ing! What is it that, thus, di&s;tracts my dearer Part of Exi&s;tence? Your Mind, your Spirit, my Angel, is &s;till pure and unpolluted; and Bodies are, merely as Bodies, incapable of Defilement, being doomed, from our Birth, to Di&s;&s;o|lution and Corruption.</P>
<P>Ah, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;he exclaimed, you are quite be&s;ide the Mark, I &s;igh not, I weep not, I grieve not for my&s;elf. I fear not, nor regard the Con&s;equences, howe|ver fatal, of what has happened. Suppo&s;e a &s;udden and &s;hameful Death, I thank my God for it, Death will offer me up a Vic|tim &s;till pure and unpolluted. But, O, the wretched <HI>Stivers,</HI> what is now become of him? &s;ent, &s;o &s;udden and unprovided, to his eternal Audit. Unhappy that I am! perhaps, an In&s;trument of Perdition to an immortal Being. Ah, rather, that I had
<PB N="289" REF="293">not been born! would I had peri&s;h'd in his Stead! A Death, in the Cau&s;e of Vir|tue, had been my Advocate for Mercy.</P>
<P>How is this? my <HI>Arabella,</HI> I cried. Is Condemnation, then, to be brought upon the Good, becau&s;e they oppo&s;e them&s;elves to Evil? Would you have cen&s;ured any one living, except your&s;elf, for having given you this Deliverance, by the Death of the Ravi&s;her? No, &s;urely. In the daily and nightly Robberies, Ma&s;&s;acres, and A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, that the violent machinate again&s;t the Peaceful; is it the Fault of tho&s;e, who &s;tand in the Defence of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, that Villains often peri&s;h in the Act of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? Tell me, my &s;weet Mourner; in the Sacking of a City, when the lu&s;tful and bloody Soldiery are loo&s;ed to their whole Delight in Burnings, Rapes, Rapines, Slaughters, Howlings, and Vio|lations; is it the Perpetrators of all the&s;e Horrors that you compa&s;&s;ionate, when they happen to be cru&s;hed in the Ruins they have wrought? Meritorious, my <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> mo&s;t meritorious were that Hand, who &s;hould cut a whole Ho&s;t of &s;uch In|fernals from the Earth; remaining Inno|cence and Virtue would be his Debtors for ever. Commi&s;eration to the Flagitious is Cruelty to the Ju&s;t; and he who &s;pares them becomes the Accomplice of all their future Crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="294">
During Tea, my Wife gave me an am|ple Narrative of all that happened, at our Hou&s;e, while I was in Confinement. As &s;he &s;poke, I was, fir&s;t, Speechle&s;s, with fearful and panting Expectation, I was, then, kindled into Fury and a vehement Thir&s;t of Vengeance. And, la&s;tly, I was elevated into an aweful Rapture. I look|ed at my Wife, with Eyes, &s;wimming with Love and Veneration. I ro&s;e from my Seat. I threw my&s;elf on my Knees before her. Adorable Creature, I cried, divine <HI>Arabella!</HI> &s;upreme Excellence of Women! thus let me wor&s;hip, through the pure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> of all Mediums, that GOD|HEAD who in&s;pires, and delights in &s;uch Perfections!</P>
<P>Our Fortune was, now, reduced to ve|ry little more than fifteen Guineas. We had no Clothes but what we wore; and we did not dare to go or &s;end, to our Hou&s;e, for others; neither to make our|&s;elves known to any Acquaintance. We went by the Name of <HI>Stapleton;</HI> and on the following Night, I ventured abroad, and bought, for my&s;elf a few &s;econd-hand Shirts, with a common Gown and &s;ome Changes of Linen for my Wife.</P>
<P>On the fifth Day, at Breakfa&s;t, while <HI>Arabella</HI> was ca&s;ting her Eye over a News|paper,
<PB N="291" REF="295">that &s;he had borrowed from Mrs. <HI>Jennett,</HI> &s;he turned &s;uddenly pale. What, &s;he cried, before I could que&s;tion her, ac|cu&s;ed for Robbery, as well as Murder? that is hard, indeed. But I tru&s;t that my Lot &s;hall not exceed my Re&s;ignation. And, &s;o &s;aying, &s;he handed me over the Paper, with a Smile in which Heaven appeared to open.</P>
<P>The Adverti&s;ement ran thus &mdash; <HI>WHEREAS</HI> Arabella Clement, <HI>alias</HI> Graves, <HI>did, on the 15th Day of</HI> Septem|ber <HI>In&s;tant, mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly &s;tab and mur|der the Rt. Hon.</HI> James **** <HI>late Lord</HI> Stivers, <HI>at a Hou&s;e of ill Report, where &s;he formerly had kept a Milliner's Shop, in</HI> Fleet-Street: <HI>And, whereas &s;he did, further, rob the &s;aid Rt. Hon.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of a large Pur&s;e of Money, his Gold Repeater, Snuff-Box, Diamond-Ring,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and did, la&s;tly, flee for the &s;ame, as may be proved, and is evident, from the Exami|nation and Te&s;timony of three concurring Wit|ne&s;&s;es. Now his Maje&s;ty, in his gracious Ab|horrence of &s;uch Crimes, doth, hereby, promi&s;e a Reward, of three hundred Guineas, to any Per&s;on who &s;hall &s;top, di&s;cover, or arre&s;t the &s;aid</HI> Arabella, <HI>&s;o as that &s;he may be brought to condign and adequate Puni&s;hment, if any &s;uch may be found for &s;uch unequall'd Of|fences.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="296">
O, &s;aid my Wife, I perceive that my Enemies will &s;wear home, indeed. Their Plunder of Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> can, no Way, be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ave by my Condemnation. But, be it as it may, that Providence, who overules the Wickedne&s;s of this World, may yet give Submi&s;&s;ion a Clue to E&s;cape its Perplexities. And, my Innocence, I tru&s;t, will be an Equivalent to all that the World can inflict, and much more than an Equivalent to all that it can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>I now had every Thing to fear for my <HI>Arabella,</HI> as well from the intere&s;ted Vil|lany of the Witne&s;&s;es, as from the Power of the Mini&s;try, and the Re&s;entment of the Relations of &s;o great a Man; and I looked upon her Death to be as certain as her Caption. Had I been the Fir&s;t, in Remainder, to the greate&s;t E&s;tate in <HI>En|gland,</HI> I would have exchanged my whole Intere&s;t, for as much ready Ca&s;h as would have &s;erved to convey us to &s;ome Region of Safety. But this was not practicable, with the very &s;mall Remainder of the Wreck of our Fortune; and, we had ta|ken our Lodging certain at fifty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter.</P>
<P>We appeared, as little as po&s;&s;ible, even to the Lodgers of the Hou&s;e; and I inti|mated, to my Landlady, that it was the
<PB N="293" REF="297">Fate of many a Gentleman to be obliged to ab&s;cond, till his Affairs could be com|pounded, with hard hearted Creditors.</P>
<P>During the Space of nine Months, our principal Diet was weak Tea and Bread, and, if we ventured, at odd Times, on a &s;mall Joint of Meat, it &s;erved us cold, ha&s;hed and minced, from one Week to the other.</P>
<P>As my Wife did not dare to take in Work, nor I to &s;tir abroad to look for Employment, our chief Entertainment was the reading &s;ome old Folio Books, of Hi&s;|tory and Divinity, which I borrowed from Mrs. <HI>Jennett,</HI> and which had belonged to her Father.</P>
<P>How &s;mall mu&s;t be the Cravings of &s;im|ple Nature, when, a Family, like ours, accu&s;tomed to Affluence, could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in <HI>London,</HI> without murmuring, for upward of nine Months, on le&s;s than eight Gui|neas. But, our Fund was, now, exhau&s;t|ed to a few Shillings; and my Sword, Watch, and Buckles were, al&s;o, gone, in Di&s;charge of our three Quarters Rent to the Landlady. Ruin &s;tared us in the Face. I beheld, as it were, a Gulph, un|fathomable and impa&s;&s;able, opening be|neath our Feet, and Heaven and Earth joining to pu&s;h us down the Precipice.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="298">
We, yet, lived, a Month longer, on coar&s;e Bread and cold Water, with a little Milk which we got, now and then, for the Child; but, I concealed, from my Wife, that we had not a &s;ingle Six-pence now left upon Earth.</P>
<P>I looked up to Heaven, but without Love or Confidence. Dreadful Power, I cried, who thus breake&s;t to Powder the poor Ve&s;&s;els of thy Creation! Thou art &s;aid to be a bounteous and benevolent Caterer, to the Spawn of the Ocean, and to the Worms of the Earth. Thou clothe&s;t the Birds of the Air, and the Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t; they hunger, and find a Ban|quet at Hand. Thou &s;hedde&s;t the Dew of thy Comforts, even on the Unrighteous, thou opene&s;t thy Hand, and all Things, living are &s;aid to be filled with Plenteou&s;|ne&s;s. Are we, alone, excepted from the Immen&s;ity of thy Works? &s;hall the Piety of my Wife, &s;hall the Innocence of my Infant, thus fami&s;h, unregarded and unpi|tied, before thee?</P>
<P>Ah! it is I who am the accur&s;ed Thing. Who bring Plagues upon all with whom I am connected. Even the Labours of my Life, the I&s;&s;ues of my hone&s;t Indu&s;try, have been changed, by thy Ordinances in|to nothing but Damage. To the Impri|&s;onment
<PB N="295" REF="299">of my Per&s;on; to the Ruin of tho&s;e who had the Misfortune to befriend me; and to the Death, Danger, and De|&s;olation of all whom I held dear. I &s;trive, in vain, with thy Omnipotence, it is too mighty for me, and cru&s;hes me below the Centre. Pour out then the Ve&s;&s;els of thy Wrath upon my Head, but, on my Head alone, O ju&s;t Creator! and take the&s;e Lit|tle-Ones to thy Mercy, for they cannot have participated of the Guilt thou art plea&s;ed to impute to me.</P>
<P>The Night was, now, advanced, but that, which fell upon my Soul, was a Night which would admit no Ray of Com|fort, nor looked ever to behold another Morning. I wi&s;hed for Di&s;&s;olution to my|&s;elf, to the Univer&s;e. I wi&s;hed to &s;ee the two Proprietors, of my Soul's late Affec|tions, now lying pale and breathle&s;s before my Eyes. I would not have endured my Hell another Moment. I would have gi|ven my&s;elf in&s;tant Death; but I dreaded to leave my de&s;olate Widow, and helple&s;s Orphan, without a Friend, as I then con|ceived, either in Heaven or Earth.</P>
<P>My Wife had lain down, with her In|fant, on the Bed. A &s;udden Reflection &s;tarted. My Death, thought I, may yet be u&s;eful to tho&s;e, for whom alone I could wi&s;h to live. I ro&s;e, frantically determin|ed.
<PB N="296" REF="300">My Brain was on Fire. I took down an old Pi&s;tol, which hung in a Corner, I put it into my Brea&s;t; down Stairs I went, and i&s;&s;ued to the Street.</P>
<P>I was bent on &s;omething de&s;perate, but knew not what. I had not gone far, when I &s;aw a large Tavern open be&s;ide me. I pa&s;&s;ed through the Entry, and, running up Stairs, boldly enter'd the Din|ing Room, where a numerous Company of Gentlemen &s;at round their Bottle. I clapt to the Door; and taking out the Pi&s;tol, Gentlemen, I cried, I &s;tarve, I die for Want; re&s;olve, in&s;tantly, to relieve, or to peri&s;h along with me.</P>
<P>They all fixed their Eyes upon me; but, the meager Frenzy, as I &s;uppo&s;e, which they &s;aw in my Countenance, held them &s;ilent. The Per&s;on, who was near|e&s;t, directly took out his Pur&s;e and pre|&s;ented it to me. I, again, returned it to him, and, putting up my Pi&s;tol; no no, Sir, I cried, I will not take your Gold, I am no Robber. But, give me &s;ome Silver, among ye, to keep, awhile, from the Grave, three Creatures who fami&s;h amid&s;t a plentiful World.</P>
<P>They all, as by one Con&s;ent, put their Hands to their Pockets, and, in&s;tantly made a Heap of upward of three Pounds.
<PB N="297" REF="301">I devoured it with my Eyes. I beheld it as a Mint of Money; and panting, and grappling at it, like a Vulture, I &s;tuffed it into a &s;ide Pocket; and being too full of Acknowledgment to thank my Benefactors, by Word or Token; I bur&s;t forth into Tears, and, turning from them, I got, once more, into the Street, without any Interruption.</P>
<P>I made, directly, home, and, &s;tepping &s;oftly up Stairs, I, fir&s;t re&s;tored the Pi&s;tol to its old Station. I, then, went to the Clo&s;et, where my Wife lay, &s;till, a&s;leep. I gently awaked her, by the Fondne&s;s of my Care&s;&s;es. My <HI>Arabella,</HI> I cried, I have ventured out, for the fir&s;t Time; and Heaven has &s;ent us &s;ome &s;mall Relief by a Friend that I happened to meet. Here my Love, I &s;aid, putting a Crown into her Hand, call the Maid, and &s;end out for &s;ome comfortable Su&s;tenance; our Fa&s;t has been long, indeed.</P>
<P>Within a few Days, our Strength and our Spirits began to recruit, though we, &s;till, continued to live much within the Bounds of Temperance. My Soul, again, &s;ettled into a kind of &s;ullen Calm, and looked forth, though at a Di&s;tance, to &s;ome future Dawning.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="302">
One Day as my Landlady's Bible lay &s;hut, before me, a &s;udden Thought oc|curred. I breathed up, to God, a &s;hort and &s;ilent Ejaculation, be&s;eeching him to in&s;truct me in what I ought to do, by the Pa&s;&s;age, upon which my Thumb &s;hould happen to re&s;t, on opening the Book. I, in&s;tantly, made the Venture, and found the following Words. <HI>I will ari&s;e and go to my Father and will &s;ay unto him, Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t thee, and before Heaven, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</HI></P>
<P>Alas, I was far from imagining at that Time, that it was no other than my Fa|ther in Heaven, who called me, and who would, thereby, have directed and con|ducted me to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I puzzled and racked my Memory, to di&s;cover in what I had given ju&s;t Offence to my earthly Progenitor, but, re&s;olved, in all Events, to ob&s;erve the Admonition.</P>
<P>In the Du&s;k of the Evening, I tied my Handkerchief, Sailor-like, about my Neck, I pulled my Wig forward, and, &s;louching my Hat, I &s;lid out of Doors; and, &s;toop|ing Half double, I limped, with a coun|terfeited Gate, toward my Father's. I was, duely, appriz'd that, if I knocked at the Door, or directly enquired for him, I
<PB N="299" REF="303">&s;hould not be admitted. I, therefore, walked to and again, now near, now aloof, for near an Hour, before his Door, in pa|tient Expectation of his Appearance.</P>
<P>I had repeated this Exerci&s;e, for five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Evenings, when the Door, at length, opened, and a Servant, in Livery, came up and acco&s;ted me. Is your Name <HI>Clement,</HI> Sir? Suppo&s;e it were, &s;ays I. Suppo&s;ing &s;o, replied he, I am ordered to tell you, that my Ma&s;ter is well informed of all your wicked De&s;igns, and that, if ever you appear, again, in Sight of his Windows, he will &s;end you to Newgate, without Bail or Mainprize, and pro&s;ecute you to the la&s;t of the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>We parted, without another Word, and I cro&s;&s;ed over the Way to a Chandler's Shop. The good Woman of the Hou&s;e al&s;o happened to &s;ell &s;ome &s;mall Ale, in her back Apartments. I called for a Mugg, and reque&s;ted her Company for a few Minutes. After &s;ome introductory Chat, I addre&s;&s;ed her, in a Manner, that I judged mo&s;t engaging for one in her Sphere. She, very freely, told me the Hi&s;tory of my Father and his pre&s;ent Fa|mily, and further, that it was his Cu&s;tom, on every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> to repair to the <HI>Trade&s;man's Club,</HI> at the Golden Anchor in <HI>Temple-Lane,</HI> about eight of the Clock,
<PB N="300" REF="304">at Night, and not to return till about eleven.</P>
<P>I went Home, &s;omething &s;atisfied with this Intelligence, as I now knew where to find my unnatural Parent, though his la&s;t barbarous and in&s;ulting Me&s;&s;age had ren|dered me hopele&s;s, and quite aver&s;e to any kind of Application to him.</P>
<P>We had now lived, three Months lon|ger, on the la&s;t Booty, or Charity, I know not which to call it. We were, again, reduced to the la&s;t Shilling, and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, our Landlady became importu|nate for her Quarter's Rent. My Wife had lately reque&s;ted her, to look out for &s;ome Semp&s;try-Work, among the Neigh|bours. This &s;he promi&s;ed to do, but, purpo&s;ely, declined, as &s;he and her Family got the Benefit of her Labour, gratis.</P>
<P>I began, again, to return to my former evil Thoughts. I re&s;olved to make War upon the whole Race of Man, rather than my Wife and Infant &s;hould peri&s;h in my Sight. But, I reflected that it was more equitable to begin with a Father, on whom Nature had given me a Right of Depen|dence; than to prey upon Strangers, on whom, Nece&s;&s;ity, alone, could give me any Claim.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="305">
It was <HI>Monday</HI> Night. The Clock &s;truck ten. I took down the old Pi&s;tol, and marched toward the Anchor. I patroled near the Place of Expectation, above an Hour. The Night was exce&s;&s;ive dark, and no Lamps in that Part; at length I li&s;tened to the Sound of di&s;tant Steps, and, &s;oon after hear'd a Voice cry Murder, Murder, Robbery! Watch, Watch!</P>
<P>I ran to the Cry, and perceived one Man on the Ground, and another &s;toop|ing, in Act, to rifle his Pockets. I, in|&s;tantly, drew my Pi&s;tol, and, &s;triking at the Robber's Head with my full Force, I laid him &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the Pavement. I, then, gently rai&s;ed the other, who was bleeding and &s;tunned by the Stroke he had received. I &s;upported him, Step by Step, toward a di&s;tant Lamp, where, at length, we arrived and found a Tavern open. I enter'd and ordered a Room, with Fire and Lights; and de&s;ired that a Surgeon &s;hould be, immediately, called. The Gentleman, who&s;e Face was, nearly, co|vered with Blood and Dirt, began now to recover his Strength and Sen&s;es. I got him to &s;wallow a &s;mall Dram of Spirits; and he &s;tepped, with me, up Stairs, &s;carce|ly leaning on my Shoulder.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="306">
While we &s;at at the Fire, and a Nap|kin and warm Water were getting ready; the Stranger grew pa&s;&s;ionate in his Ac|knowledgments for the Life, which he &s;aid he owed me, and which Service he pro|mi&s;ed to recompen&s;e, to the Stretch of his Power and Fortunes. But, when he had wa&s;hed and wiped away the Blood and Dirt from his Face; Heaven! what was my Emotion, at the Sight of an A&s;pect, once, &s;o loved, and &s;o revered! all my In|juries and Re&s;entments vani&s;hed, in&s;tantly, from my Memory. I fell at his Knees, with a great Cry. Is it you, then, my Father! my once dear, my ever dear and lamented Father! is it the Face of a Father that I, at la&s;t, behold? I bur&s;t into Tears. I wept aloud. I, interruptedly demanded, will you not know me? will you not own me? will not Nature &s;peak in you? will you not acknowledge your Son, your once beloved <HI>Hammel,</HI> &s;o long the Comfort of your Age, and the Pride of your Expecta|tions?</P>
<P>While I &s;poke, my Father looked wild and eager upon me. He, at length, re|collected me through all my Leanne&s;s and poor Apparel; and, he&s;itatingly, replied; I, I, I believe indeed you are my Child <HI>Hammel;</HI> and, &s;trait, fainted away.</P>
