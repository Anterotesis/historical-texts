<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of the following pages, is to point out the mo&s;t mate|rial cau&s;es, that occur in a large Town, to give ri&s;e to infectious di&s;|ea&s;es; to &s;hew the &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary to be taken to prevent &s;uch &s;ources of contagion; and to advi&s;e &s;ome pre|cautions to be u&s;ed, that are mo&s;t likely to prevent infection, during the prevalence of the&s;e di&s;orders.</P>
<P>A performance of this nature car|ried to its full extent, might be made to fill a volume; but I have indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;tudied to make every direc|tion as &s;hort, and conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; for had I entered more largely into the &s;ubject, I mu&s;t have written a
<PB N="v" REF="3">book that would only have been read by a few, whereas this &s;mall pam|phlet can readily be obtained by mo&s;t people. I have given my opinion in the form of paragraphs, as I imagine that this mode of giving directions is the ea&s;ie&s;t to be under&s;tood, &s;ince by this means the mind is not fa|tigued with a chain of rea&s;oning. I have avoided all rea&s;oning on the pro|priety of any direction that I have given, as I tru&s;t that it will appear &s;elf-evident; and had I entered into a vindication and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the utility of what is recommended in each paragraph, I &s;hould not only have made the&s;e pages too numerous to be generally read, but &s;hould have been obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;ci|entific rea&s;oning, that could only have been intelligible to tho&s;e of my own profe&s;&s;ion. I have therefore careful|ly
<PB N="vi" REF="4">&s;hunned every profe&s;&s;ional Term; a circum&s;tance that &s;hould always be attended to, by tho&s;e that write for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay, that the following pages contain every direc|tion, that may on &s;ome occa&s;ions be nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent or remove the cau&s;es of infectious di&s;orders; I will only venture to &s;ay, that on all occa|&s;ions, what I have given will be e&s;|&s;entially requi&s;ite; and are proper to con&s;titute the grand outlines, of any regulations that may be deemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to prevent and remove con|tagious di&s;ea&s;es from a City. I have likewi&s;e added, by way of po&s;t&s;cript to my plan, &s;ome directions that from experience have been &s;ound &s;ervicea|ble, to &s;uch as vi&s;it unhealthy cli|mates; which I thought would not
<PB N="vii" REF="5">be unacceptable to the inhabitants of a large commercial City.</P>
<P>Small as this performance is, I doubt not but that it may meet with critical cen&s;ure from &s;ome; but as men of di&s;cernment, will I hope al|ways judge for them&s;elves, and allow their opinions to be &s;wayed only by the cool deci&s;ion of an unprejudiced mind, I &s;hall always de&s;pi&s;e whatever impotent cen&s;ure may proceed from motives of ungenerous &s;elf-intere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>THE METHOD OF PREVENTING AND REMOVING THE CAUSES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE health of the Inhabitants of eve|ry large Town, depends very much on the police of the place, and on the due per|formance of every duty connected there|with.</P>
<P N="2">II. As the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as well as the execution of every regulation, made either for the convenience or health of a City,
<PB N="9" REF="7">are more immediately connected with the functions of magi&s;tracy, the Magi&s;trates are in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable to the In|habitants, in &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to enforce a proper obedience to, and of cour&s;e a per|fect performance of every law, that for the&s;e purpo&s;es may have been adopted.</P>
<P N="3">III. The fir&s;t material con&s;ideration for pre&s;erving the health of the Inhabitants in a large Town, is a rigid attention, to every &s;tep that can tend to produce cleanline&s;s; and in the laying out of every additional building, to &s;ecure a free communication of pure air, and a facility of pre&s;erving clean|line&s;s, ought always to be kept in view by tho&s;e that have the management of the police.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Nor &s;hould a hou&s;e be built in a place likely to prove unhealthy, &s;ince not only its own inhabitants would &s;uffer, but it would readily become a &s;ource of infec|tion to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive City.</P>
<P N="5">V. In building a Town, the &s;treets ought to be &s;o wide as to in&s;ure a free circulation of air, and the wider the &s;treets are in any
<PB N="10" REF="8">Town, the more healthy will the inhabit|ants be found; whereas narrow &s;treets, by admitting a le&s;s proportion of pure air, have every chance of creating infectious di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">VI. When it can be done, hou&s;es ought to be built on the north &s;ide of any mar&s;h, &s;wampy ground, or large rivers, that are apt often to ebb and flow, rather than on the &s;outh &s;ide of &s;uch places: Becau&s;e from the&s;e, the &s;un powerfully exhales &s;uch vapours, as by being breathed or otherwi&s;e applied to the body, are capable of producing many contagious di&s;ea&s;es. Whereas the inhabitants on the north &s;ide of &s;uch places, are in no ri&s;que of being expo&s;ed to the&s;e a&s;cending vapours. Hou&s;es built on the north-we&s;t of a large Town, will always prove the mo&s;t healthy.</P>
<P N="7">VII. All &s;laughter-hou&s;es, and butcheries, ought to be in the &s;outh of every Town; and the Magi&s;trates ought to enforce the greate&s;t cleanline&s;s in the&s;e places, that the nature of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s can admit of; and the filth produced in &s;uch places ought not to pa&s;s through any channel, that goes
<PB N="11" REF="9">through the City. The mo&s;t certain way of preventing di&s;ea&s;es from ari&s;ing in con|&s;equence of the filth of &s;uch places, is by obliging the butchers, &amp;c. to bury all offal, blood, &amp;c. before they have time to become offen&s;ive, or to remove them to &s;ome di&s;|tant place from the City.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. That of &s;laughtering animals in the &s;treets, and permitting the blood, &amp;c, to remain there, ought to be made highly criminal, and puni&s;hed accordingly.</P>
<P N="9">IX. All dead hor&s;es, dogs, cats, &amp;c. ought to be buried, or carried to &s;ome di&s;|tant place; nothing gives a &s;tranger a mean|er idea of the ta&s;te of the inhabitants of a Town, or produces more certain &s;ources of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, than to &s;ee &s;uch dead animals laying about the &s;treets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have a well authenticated account of a very violent infectious fever breaking out at Fgmont in North Holland, occa&s;ioned by the rotting of a Whale, which had been left on the &s;hore. There is likewi&s;e an in&s;tance of a contagious fever breaking out in the cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of a French &s;hip, owing to the putrefaction of &s;ome cattle that they had killed on the i&s;land of Nevis, in the We&s;t-Indies.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<P N="10">X. Tan-yards, and &s;uch factories as pro|duce offen&s;ive &s;mells, ought never to be permitted in the middle of any large Town. They ought only to be in &s;uch parts as have lea&s;t communication with the inha|bitants at large.</P>
<P N="11">XI. All filth &s;hould be removed from every &s;treet and lane, early every morning, and carried to a common re&s;ervoir at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Town; and peo|ple &s;hould be appointed, &s;o many to each di&s;trict, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it ought to be dur|ing the day, to carry entirely out of the Town, whatever filth or dirt may be pro|duced on the &s;treets. That of collecting dunghills on the &s;treets, and allowing them to remain there, during the plea&s;ure of a Scavenger, is very hurtful to the health of the inhabitants,</P>
<P N="12">XII. Common &s;ewers, or &s;hores, ought to extend through every &s;treet, and &s;hould empty them&s;elves entirely out of, or at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Town; and great care &s;hould be taken to keep them perfect|ly free, and fit for their duty; it likewi&s;e ought to be a puni&s;hable crime, to throw
<PB N="13" REF="11">any thing into a &s;hore that might tend to choke it up.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The e&s;tabli&s;hing of publick Privies, or Nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;es, in convenient parts of a Town, is e&s;&s;ential to its cleanline&s;s; as the want of &s;uch places of convenience, is a material cau&s;e of the filth &s;o frequently found in lanes, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Such publick Nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;es, ought to be carefully attended to, by the police officers, and &s;o con&s;tructed as to be ea&s;ily cleaned, which ought to be done ve|ry early every morning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When large armies have been long encamped on the &s;ame ground, putrid di&s;ea&s;es frequently ari&s;e, in con|&s;equence of the filth unavoidably produced by a large body of people, for a length of time occupying the &s;ame place; and the only mode of re&s;toring health to the ar|my, has been found, to be that of removing the camp to new ground; and an army is generally mo&s;t healthy, where the nature of the &s;ervice makes it nece&s;&s;ary, for the army to move frequently. This mode, &s;o well known to the moderns, was &s;ometimes practiced by the ancient Generals. Vegetius &s;eems to have been well ac|quainted with the nece&s;&s;ity of cleanline&s;s to remove or prevent contagious di&s;ea&s;es, for in his &s;y&s;tem <HI>de Re Mili|tari,</HI> he u&s;es the&s;e words, <Q>"Si autumnali, ae&s;tivoque tem|pore diutius in ii&s;dem locis militum multitudo con&s;i&s;tat, ex contagione aquarum, et odoris ip&s;ius foeditate vitiatis hau&s;tibus, et aere corrupto, perricie&s;i&s;&s;imus na&s;citur mor|bus, qui prohiberi non pote&s;t aliter, ni&s;i frequenti muta|tione ca&s;trorum." <BIBL>VEGET. <HI>de Re Militari,</HI> lib. iii. cap. 2.</BIBL></Q> Quintus Curtius likewi&s;e tells of Alexander the Great af|ter the battle of Arbela, being obliged to follow the &s;ame method to pre&s;erve the health of the &s;oldiery. "Ingruentibus deinde morbis, ques odor cadaverum to|tis jacentium campis vulgaverat, maturius ca&s;tra movit." lib. v. 32. And in the mo&s;t ancient times we find that cleanline&s;s was reckoned e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of health; and the proper injunctions for that purpo&s;e, were by no means &s;uppo&s;ed incompatible with the dig|nity of tho&s;e highe&s;t in power. Thus we find the divine law-giver Mo&s;es, enjoining cleanline&s;s in the camp of the Jews, in a mo&s;t particular manner, when he &s;ays. <Q>"Thou &s;halt have a place al&s;o without the camp, whe|ther thou &s;halt go forth abroad: and thou &s;halt have a paddle on thy weapon, and it &s;hall be when thou wilt ea&s;e thy&s;elf abroad, thou &s;halt dig therewith, and &s;halt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee. For the Lord thy God walketh in the mid&s;t of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee: therefore &s;hall thy camp be holy, that he &s;ee no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee," <BIBL>DEUT. chap. xxiii. ver. 12, 13, 14.</BIBL></Q>&mdash;Since then we find how fre|quently contagious di&s;ea&s;es are produced in a camp, by a great body of people collected together, while at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t judicious regulations for pre&s;erving clean|line&s;s, are by military di&s;cipline better enforced, than per|haps the be&s;t regulated civil police can ever accompli&s;h; and &s;ince it is evident, that the inhabitants of a Town, cannot avail them&s;elves of changing ground, and thereby leaving behind them whatever might tend to produce di&s;|ea&s;es, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee how e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary it mu&s;t be to take every &s;tep, that can tend to prevent the direful con&s;equences ari&s;ing from putrid &s;ub&s;tances laying in, and about a Town.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12">
<P N="15">XV. A plentiful &s;upply of good water is in&s;eparably connected with the health of a Town; the hou&s;es of opulent individu|als being provided with good water by
<PB N="15" REF="13">means of pipes, is of &s;mall benefit to tho&s;e of inferior circum&s;tances, that in all nati|ons con&s;titute the great body of the people.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The ea&s;y attainment of an ample &s;upply of this nece&s;&s;ary article in life to the people at large, merits the greate&s;t at|tention of the police. In many Towns where good water can only be obtained at a di&s;tance, publick pipes that conduct the water from the grand re&s;ervoir are e&s;tab|li&s;hed in convenient quarters of the Town, by which means the poor are enabled to partake of this common bounty of provi|dence, in as great perfection as the rich.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Jails, Poor-hou&s;es, and Ho&s;pitals, ought always to be in the mo&s;t remote quarters of a Town; but at the &s;ame time
<PB N="16" REF="14">in &s;uch places as are little likely by &s;itua|tion to become unhealthy, lea&s;t they &s;hould turn out nur&s;eries for propagating di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. An officer of the police ought daily to vi&s;it every part of the jail, poor|hou&s;e, and other publick charity, to enforce a due obedience, to &s;uch orders as the po|lice may think proper to make, for the re|gulation of &s;uch places; and the vi&s;iting officer &s;hould be authori&s;ed, to inflict &s;uch puni&s;hment as may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary (and as may have been fixed by the police) for any neglect of duty, or di&s;obedience of orders, that the re&s;pective officers of &s;uch places may be found guilty of.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. In all jails, poor-hou&s;es, &amp;c. the utmo&s;t attention &s;hould be paid, to the &s;hirts and &s;hifts of the pri&s;oners in jail, and the inhabitants of a poor hou&s;e. Their linen ought to be changed at lea&s;t twice a week, and the officer of police &s;hould not only enforce this order, but &s;hould take care that the linen has been properly wa&s;h|ed, and well aired before it is given to wear.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="15">
<P N="20">XX. All jails, poor-hou&s;es, &amp;c. ought to be provided with a &s;ufficient quantity of linen, to &s;upply &s;uch as may be &s;ent there without a &s;ufficiency of this nece&s;&s;ary arti|cle; and tho&s;e who have the care of &s;uch places, ought to be an&s;werable, that &s;uch linen is kept in good order, and always forth coming. And every jail &s;hould be &s;upplied with a quantity of good blanket|ting.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. Every room in jail, poor-hou&s;e, &amp;c. ought to be &s;wept carefully every morning, the &s;ides and ceiling as well as the floor ought to undergo this operation; and the &s;traw and other bedding, when the weather is dry, ought to be carried out, and laid in a yard (that ought always to belong to a jail) for the benefit of the air, five or &s;ix hours every day.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. As &s;oon as the &s;traw, bedding, &amp;c. has been carried out of the different rooms, the floors ought to be &s;trewed over with &s;and or &s;aw-du&s;t, which next morning is to be &s;wept out, and the &s;ame proce&s;s to be repeated every day.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<P N="23">XXIII. When wet weather renders the carrying into the air of the &s;traw and other bedding inadmi&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould be re|moved into a corner of the room, to per|mit it to undergo the directions ordered as above.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. The &s;traw for a jail, poor-hou&s;e, &amp;c. ought to be changed at lea&s;t once eve|ry month, and care &s;hould be taken that the old &s;traw is either burnt, or carried to &s;ome di&s;tance from the Town.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. If feather-beds, or hair-mattre&s;|&s;es, are ever u&s;ed in a jail, poor-hou&s;e, &amp;c. be&s;ides being regularly expo&s;ed to the free air, on every dry day, they ought to be &s;u|migated once a week, by being held at a proper di&s;tance over the &s;moke of burning brim&s;tone, or gun-powder.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. All &s;heeting &s;hould be changed once a fortnight, and the &s;heets and blan|kets when the weather will permit, ought to be put on ropes fixed in the yard for the purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing them to the action of the air.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="17">
<P N="27">XXVII. Every boarded floor &s;hould be wa&s;hed with &s;oap and water once every week, and it ought to be done in the morn|ing of a dry day, that the inhabitants of the room may be enabled to remain in the yard, till the floor is perfectly dry and co|vered over with &s;and. The &s;ides of the room and ceiling &s;hould undergo the &s;ame operation.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. All dungeons of a jail &s;hould have boarded bottoms, and their &s;ides plai&s;|tered to make cleanline&s;s the more practica|ble; but when the&s;e places happen to have clay floors, and rough walls for their &s;ides, the floors and walls ought daily to be &s;wept with a hard broom, and the walls once a week, ought to be wa&s;hed by throwing &s;oap and water upon them with a mop, after which they may be dried by careful|ly &s;weeping with a broom, and by burning &s;ome fuel in a chaffing di&s;h; a practice that ought frequently to be u&s;ed in all &s;ubtera|neous apartments, and which ought like|wi&s;e to be had recour&s;e to in all rooms in jails, poor-hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. Every room &s;hould have its win|dows &s;o &s;ituated, as to admit of a free cur|rent
<PB N="20" REF="18">of fre&s;h air at plea&s;ure; and all win|dow &s;a&s;hes, when there is no rain, &s;hould be opened &s;ome hours every day.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Every jail, and poor-hou&s;e or other charity, ought to have a commodious yard annexed to it, and a privy &s;hould be &s;ituated in &s;ome part of it, that will prove lea&s;t offen&s;ive. Into the&s;e privies all cham|ber-pots, &amp;c. &s;hould be emptied, and the regular cleaning of &s;uch privies, &s;hould be carefully attended to.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Every pri&s;oner in jail, ought to be (unle&s;s prevented by &s;ickne&s;s) made to remain in the yard for &s;ome hours every day in fair weather, and as a military guard attends on every jail, a proper number of centinels being po&s;ted in the yard, would render the walking about of tho&s;e con|demned to die, perfectly admi&s;&s;ible. Eve|ry pri&s;oner ought to twig and bru&s;h his cloaths in the yard, every day in dry wea|ther.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. A &s;eparate building with con|venient rooms ought to belong to every jail, and publick building, for the purpo&s;e of an
<PB N="21" REF="19">ho&s;pital for the &s;ick, and when this cannot be had, a &s;ufficient number of rooms be|longing to the building it&s;elf, &s;hould be ap|propriated to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. As the regulation of the apart|ments for the &s;ick will nece&s;&s;arily belong to the Faculty that attend them, I reckon any directions on that head unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. Whenever any per&s;on belong|ing to a jail, or other publick building is taken &s;ick, he ought immediately to be re|ported to the Surgeon, or Phy&s;ician, and the per&s;on taken ill, &s;hould be removed to the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. Men of the fir&s;t abilities only, in phy&s;ic and &s;urgery, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with the care of the &s;ick, the con&s;equence of delegating this important office, to the charge of an apothecary is highly danger|ous to the inhabitants at large. Since in all &s;uch places, infectious di&s;ea&s;es are more likely to break out than any where el&s;e, it follows, that the practitioners &s;hould be &s;uch, as by their abilities are be&s;t able, &s;peedily to put a &s;top to them.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="20">
<P N="36">XXXVI. In every large Town there ought to be commodious ho&s;pitals for the reception of medical, as well as &s;urgical pa|tients, and in &s;uch ho&s;pitals there &s;hould be a &s;uite of rooms for the accommodation of &s;uch &s;ervants of the inhabitants of the Town, as may be taken ill of infectious di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The happy effects of &s;uch an in&s;titution are amply Selt by the inhabitants of Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="37">XXXVII. There &s;hould likewi&s;e be a publick Di&s;pen&s;ary, where &s;uch of the di&s;|ea&s;ed poor who&s;e ca&s;es do not require con|finement, may receive medicine and advice, and the medical attendants of the Di&s;pen|&s;ary &s;hould vi&s;it &s;uch as are confined at home, whenever the ho&s;pitals happen to be full.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Whenever any infectious di&s;|ea&s;e appears in a Town, it ought immedi|ately to be reported to the chief magi&s;trate, who ought to &s;ummon a meeting of the police, to con&s;ult with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent of the Faculty, on &s;uch &s;teps as by being carried into execution, may be mo&s;t likely to put a &s;top to its progre&s;s.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<P N="39">XXXIX. Every per&s;on that dies of any infectious di&s;ea&s;e, ought to be buried in twenty-four hours after death; and when infectious di&s;ea&s;es prevail and great morta|lity, the ringing of bells at deaths and fu|nerals &s;hould be &s;trictly prohibited. And the idle, di&s;&s;ipated cu&s;tom of a number of people a&s;&s;embling at wakes, ought on all &s;uch occa&s;ions to be forbidden, as &s;uch a practice is extremely dangerous.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Tho&s;e who attend funeral cere|monies, &s;hould not perform the&s;e duties with an empty &s;tomach, for in this &s;ituati|on they will be more apt to catch infection, both from the corp&s;e, and the hurtful va|pours that ari&s;e from a newly opened grave, than after a meal.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. When infectious di&s;ea&s;es are pre|valent in a Town, it will be of great &s;er|vice to burn gun-powder in the &s;treets, and to make fires in different parts of the Town, of any wood that abounds with re|&s;in, &s;uch as the different &s;pecies of fir.</P>

<P N="44">XLIV. All attendants on the &s;ick in &s;uch fevers, &s;hould be careful in holding the head as little over the patient as po&s;&s;ible, or in &s;peaking very near to the patient: this caution is to prevent the hurtful e&s;&s;luvia (that are more powerful in proportion as they are near to the patient) from entering the lungs.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. When the Faculty, Clergy, or others that may for any time be obliged to &s;tay by the patients bed-&s;ide, are there, a ve&s;&s;el containing warm vinegar ought to be placed near them; and it is better to &s;mell to any grateful &s;ub&s;tance, than to chew any thing as a preventative, becau&s;e in doing the latter there is danger of the infectious matter being entangled with the &s;pittle, and thereby of producing what it was intended to prevent.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. Whenever a per&s;on dies of any contagious di&s;ea&s;e, the corp&s;e ought quick|ly after death to be put into a clo&s;e coffin, and the room in which the per&s;on died &s;hould be well aired, by having the win|dows opened, until a charcoal fire be kin|dled with &s;ome rolls of &s;ulphur upon it;
<PB N="26" REF="24">after which both doors and windows ought to be kept &s;hut, for a con&s;iderable time, not le&s;s than eight or ten hours, until the room be thoroughly &s;moked; after which the windows ought to be again opened for &s;e|veral hours, and the room &s;hould not only be well &s;coured with &s;oap and water, but likewi&s;e with warm vinegar, before any one inhabits it. The &s;ame &s;teps ought to be taken with every room in which an in|fectious di&s;ea&s;e has been, though the pati|ent may have recovered: and for this pur|po&s;e it is proper that whenever a per&s;on is &s;o far recovered from any contagious di&s;|ea&s;e, as to admit of being moved with &s;afe|ty, the patient &s;hould be conveyed to ano|ther chamber, to permit the one occupied during the di&s;ea&s;e to undergo the nece&s;&s;ary purification.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. It may perhaps be proper to ob|&s;erve, that the blankets, linen, &amp;c. of &s;uch as die of infectious di&s;ea&s;es, ought to be &s;teeped for &s;ome time in cold water, before they undergo the u&s;ual proce&s;s of being wa&s;hed: for if without this precaution they were to be wa&s;hed in hot water in the u&s;ual manner, the hurtful &s;teams that

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS putrid di&s;ea&s;es are very common and violent in hot countries, it is very ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Europeans who vi&s;it tho&s;e cli|mates to be well informed, of the &s;igns of an unhealthy country, that they may be on their guard as &s;oon as they enter any fo|reign region.</P>
<P>By the be&s;t judges the following are con&s;i|dered as chiefly demanding notice.</P>
<P N="1">1. A &s;udden and great alteration in the air at &s;un&s;et, from intolerable heat to a chilling cold. This is perceived as &s;oon as the &s;un is down, and is for the mo&s;t part accompanied with a heavy fall of dew; it &s;hews an unhealthy &s;wampy &s;oil; the na|ture of which is &s;uch, that no &s;ooner the &s;un-beams are withdrawn, than the vapours emitted from it, render the air damp, raw, and chilling in the mo&s;t &s;ultry climates; &s;o that even under the equator in &s;ome un|healthy
<PB N="34" REF="32">places, the night-air is very cold to an European con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thick fogs, chiefly after &s;un-&s;et, ari&s;|ing from the valleys, and particularly from the mud, &s;lime, and other impurities. In hot countries the &s;mell of the&s;e fogs, may be compared to that of a new cleaned ditch. Di&s;ea&s;es therefore ari&s;ing from this cau&s;e, generally take place in the night, or before &s;un-ri&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Numerous &s;warms of flies, gnats, and other in&s;ects, which attend &s;tagnated air, and unhealthy places covered with wood.</P>
<P N="4">4. When all butchers meat &s;oon cor|rupts, and in a few hours becomes full of maggots; when metals are quickly ru&s;ted on being expo&s;ed to the air; and when a corp&s;e becomes intolerably offen&s;ive in le&s;s than &s;ix hours; the&s;e are proofs of a clo&s;e, hot, and unwhole&s;ome country. And in &s;uch places during exce&s;&s;ive heats and great calms, it is not uncommon for Europeans, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are of a gro&s;s habit of bo|dy, to be &s;eized at once with mo&s;t alarm|ing, and fatal &s;ymptoms of what is called the
<PB N="35" REF="33">yellow-fever, without even any previous complaint of &s;ickne&s;s, or other &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the patient has often been carried off in le&s;s than forty-eight hours.</P>
<P N="5">5. A &s;ort of &s;andy &s;oil, commonly a &s;mall loo&s;e white &s;and, as that at Pen&s;aco|la, Whydah, and the i&s;land of Bonavi&s;ta, which is found by experience to be injuri|ous to health. The pe&s;tiferous vapours ari|&s;ing during the &s;ummer months, and in the heat of the day from &s;uch a &s;andy &s;oil, is be&s;t characteri&s;ed from its effects in the ex|ten&s;ive de&s;arts of A&s;ia and Africa. It there con&s;titutes what is called the Samiel Wind; a bla&s;t which in the parched de&s;art, proves in&s;tantly fatal both to man and bea&s;t; but when it pa&s;&s;es over a &s;oil well covered with gra&s;s and vegetables has its effects greatly mitigated: it is however even then always productive of &s;ickne&s;s. Thus the &s;outh|erly winds, while they blow from the de|de&s;arts of Lybia, in the &s;ummer, at Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, produce an unhcalthy &s;ea&s;on; and at Madra&s;s the winds, which in the months of April and May, pa&s;s over a large tract of &s;and, are always hot, di&s;a|greeable, and unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="34">
<P>During the&s;e land winds, &s;udden gu&s;ts of a more hot and &s;uffocating nature, are often ob&s;erved to come from tho&s;e &s;ands, once or twice, or even more frequently in a day, which &s;eem to be this vapour in a purer form. The&s;e gu&s;ts pa&s;s very quick|ly, and affect per&s;ons who happen to &s;tand with their faces towards them, in the &s;ame manner as the hot air, which i&s;&s;ues from a burning furnace, or from a heated oven, and obliges them immediately to turn away from it in order to recover breath.</P>
<P>The effect of this hot &s;uffocating bla&s;t on the human body, even when mitigated by pa&s;&s;ing through a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere, is the &s;ame as that of inten&s;e cold; it &s;huts up every pore of the &s;kin, and entirely &s;tops the per&s;piration of &s;uch as are expo&s;ed to it. The&s;e bla&s;ts come only in the day time and always from the de&s;arts.</P>
<P>Water is the only known corrector or antidote again&s;t them; hence, coar&s;e thick clothes kept con&s;tantly wet, and hung up at the windows, or doors, greatly mitigate their violence. A hou&s;e &s;o built as to have no doors, or windows, towards the de&s;arts,
<PB N="37" REF="35">is an excellent protection again&s;t their per|nicious effects.</P>
<P>That the heat of the&s;e land-winds, as al&s;o of the &s;udden gu&s;ts which accompany them, proceed from large tracts of land, heated by the &s;un, is evident from the in|crea&s;ed heat, and &s;uffocating quality of tho&s;e winds, in proportion as the day ad|vances, and as the heat of the &s;ea&s;on is in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite winds blowing from each &s;ide of the Balagate-Mountains, are a far|ther proof of this. Tho&s;e mountains, run|ning from north to &s;outh, divide the hither penin&s;ula of India into two unequal parts, and &s;eparate what is called the Malabar, from the Coromandel coa&s;t. To the for|mer they are very near, but at a great di&s;|tance from the latter. The winds blow|ing from the&s;e hills, are on the Malabar coa&s;t always remarkably cool; but on the the coa&s;t of Coromandel, in the months of April, May, June, and July, are extremely hot and &s;uffocating as they pa&s;s over a large tract of intermediate &s;and, heated during the&s;e months by an almo&s;t vertical &s;un.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="36">
<P>Hence the Malabar coa&s;t is always co|vered with an agreeable verdure; whereas the coa&s;t of Coromandel, during the conti|nuance of the&s;e hots winds, &s;eems a barren wilderne&s;s, nothing appearing green except the trees.</P>
<P>The next con&s;iderations for &s;uch as vi&s;it unhealthy climates, are &s;uch employments as are particularly dangerous to Europeans on their fir&s;t arrival. And according to the opinion of Doctor Lind, of Ha&s;tar, who &s;erved long as a Surgeon in the Royal Na|vy, one of &s;uch dangerous employments is that of cutting down of trees, &s;hrubs, &amp;c. or clearing the ground, as it is called. Of the unhealthine&s;s of this employment there are two remarkable in&s;tances. At the con|clu&s;ion of the former war, the captain of a &s;hip went on &s;hore at the i&s;land of Domi|nica, with twelve of his men, to cut down the wood, and clear a piece of ground, which he intended to have purcha&s;ed; but in a few days &s;ickne&s;s obliged him to de&s;i&s;t from this dangerous work; the cap|tain and eleven of his men being &s;eized with violent fevers which ended in ob&s;ti|nate agues, and of which &s;everal died; and
<PB N="39" REF="37">the &s;urvivors, during their lives, had fits of the ague on the return of an ea&s;t wind.</P>
<P>The Ludlow-ca&s;tle, a &s;hip of war, in a voyage to the Coa&s;t of Guinea, al&s;o lo&s;t twenty-five of her men, at Sierra Leona, who were employed in cutting down wood for the &s;hip. This is an occupation that has often proved de&s;tructive to Europeans in tho&s;e climates, and in which they ought never to be employed, e&s;pecially during the rainy &s;ea&s;on; there being many in&s;tances of white per&s;ons, when cutting down the woods at that &s;ea&s;on, who have been taken ill in the morning, and have died before night.</P>
<P>Another evil not le&s;s dangerous, is the &s;ending of Europeans in open boats after &s;un&s;et, where the &s;oil is &s;wampy, or where there are great night fogs. The &s;ingle duty of fetching fre&s;h killed butchers meat, an|nually in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, de&s;|troys &s;everal thou&s;and &s;eamen. In tho&s;e parts of the world, butchers meat mu&s;t be brought on board at night immediately af|ter it is killed, otherwi&s;e it will not be fit for u&s;e next day; but a contract made with
<PB N="40" REF="38">the natives to &s;end it on board, would be the means of pre&s;erving many u&s;eful lives.</P>
<P>At Batavia, a boat, belonging to the Medway man of war, that attended on &s;hore every night, was three times &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively manned, not one having &s;urvived that &s;ervice. They were all taken ill in the night when on &s;hore, or when return|ing on board; &s;o that at length the officers were obliged to employ none but the na|tives on that &s;ereice.</P>
<P>Since then it is &s;o unhealthy for Euro|peans to be expo&s;ed in open boats to the night fog, it mu&s;t appear, that &s;ending them un&s;heltered in open boats, far up rivers in unhealthy climates, for wood, water, trade, or other purpo&s;es, mu&s;t be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Burying the dead in &s;wampy countries, is an occupation that has proved fatal to many, and which ought to be entru&s;ted to to the natives of the country. The efflu|via from the ground when newly opened, whether from graves or ditches, are far more dangerous than from the &s;ame &s;wampy
<PB N="41" REF="39">&s;oil, when the &s;urface is undi&s;turbed; nay, in &s;ome places it has been found almo&s;t certain death, for an European to dig a grave, unle&s;s long &s;ea&s;oned to the country.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es where it is practicable, &s;hips which vi&s;it tho&s;e unhealthy countries, &s;hould anchor at as great di&s;tance as po&s;&s;i|ble from &s;hore; or if obliged to anchor near mar&s;hy grounds, or &s;wamps, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, or hot weather, and when the wind blows directly from thence, the gun|ports in &s;hips of war, that would admit the hurtful land breeze ought to be kept &s;hut, e&s;pecially at night. Or if the &s;hip rides with her head to the wind, a thick &s;ail ought to be put on the forema&s;t, along which the &s;moke from the fire-place might be made to play and a&s;cend; any inconve|nience that the &s;moke might occa&s;ion, would be amply compen&s;ated, by its keep|ing off the direct &s;team, of the &s;wampy vapour. The be&s;t preventative again&s;t the the mi&s;chevous impre&s;&s;ion of a putrid fog, or of a mar&s;hy exhalation, is a clo&s;e, &s;hel|tered, and covered place, &s;uch as the lower apartments of a &s;hip, or a hou&s;e, in which there are no doors or windows facing the
<PB N="42" REF="40">&s;wamps. If in &s;uch places a fire is kept, either at the doors or other inlets to a hou&s;e, or in the chambers, as is practi&s;ed in &s;ome unhealthy countries during the rainy or foggy &s;ea&s;on, it will prove an excellent and effectual protection again&s;t the injuries of bad air. On board of &s;hips al&s;o, fires may be made at the hathways; and of the good effects of this, we have the following ex|ample. When the Edgar, a &s;hip of war of &s;ixty guns, was upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the year 1768, her men were very &s;ick|ly and many of them died; whereas it was ob&s;erved, that in a &s;loop of war, that was con&s;tantly in company with her, few were taken ill, and not one died during the whole voyage. This could be a&s;cribed to no other cau&s;e, but that in the &s;loop the fire-place for cooking victuals, was on the the &s;ame level with the deck where the men lay; and every morning when the fire was lighted, e&s;pecially when there was but little wind, the &s;moke from the cook-room &s;pread it&s;elf all over the &s;hip, and particu|larly over tho&s;e parts where the men lay; but from the con&s;truction of the fire-place of the Edgar, no &s;moke from it ever came between her decks. Per&s;ons on board any
<PB N="43" REF="41">&s;hip whatever are much &s;afer, than tho&s;e that make inland excur&s;ions in open boats. The intolerable heat at noon often obliges &s;uch per&s;ons to be in a manner half-naked; while a violent &s;weat i&s;&s;ues from every pore on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>An approach to unwhole&s;ome &s;wamps, at this time, is apt to produce every &s;ymp|tom of the mo&s;t dangerous fever. But if they happen to pa&s;s them at night, or lay near them in an open boat, the air from tho&s;e &s;wamps is perceived to be quite chill and cold; in &s;o much that warm thick clothing becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to guard the body again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;o great an alteration in the air, and again&s;t its hurtful quality, for its effects then on the mo&s;t healthy often produce di&s;ea&s;es that quickly terminate in death.</P>
<P>But when &s;uch expo&s;ure becomes una|voidable, the only method is then to defend the body as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the pernicious effluvia with which the air abounds. Tho&s;e employed in cutting down wood, or in other laborious and dangerous &s;ervices in hot climates, during the heat of
<PB N="44" REF="42">the day, ought to have their heads covered with a bladder dipt in vinegar, and to wa&s;h their mouths with the &s;ame liquor; and they ought morning and evening to take a do&s;e of Tincture of Bark.</P>
<P>They &s;hould leave off labour before &s;un|&s;et, and not return to work till the &s;un has had time to di&s;per&s;e the unwhole&s;ome va|pours and dews. Tho&s;e who from nece&s;|&s;ity mu&s;t remain on &s;hore, and &s;leep in dan|gerous places, mu&s;t take care not to &s;leep on the ground, expo&s;ed to dews, but in hammocks in a clo&s;e tent, &s;tanding on a dry &s;and, gravel, or chalk, near the &s;ea|&s;hore. The door of this tent &s;hould open to the &s;ea, and the back part &s;hould be pro|tected from the land breeze, by being &s;ecur|cured with double canva&s;s, covered with branches of trees. But in &s;uch ca&s;es a hut is preferable to a tent, if it is well thatch|ed, to prove a defence from the heat of the &s;un by day, and from the dews by night.</P>
<P>When the air is chill, and moi&s;t, a fire &s;hould be kept in and about the tent or hut, as the be&s;t means of purifying &s;uch unwhole&s;ome air.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="43">
<P>It is the cu&s;tom with the Negros in Gui|nea, as al&s;o of &s;ome Indians, to have a fire producing a little &s;moke, con&s;tantly burn|ing in their huts where they &s;leep. This not only corrects the moi&s;ture of the night, but al&s;o, by occa&s;ioning more &s;moke than heat, renders the damp from the earth le&s;s hurtful. Doctor Lind gives us an in&s;tance of a Guinea &s;hip being up one of the rivers for trade, and it was found to be very dan|gerous to &s;leep on &s;hore, without which their trade could not be &s;o conveniently carried on. Fir&s;t the captain, then the mate, and two or three of the &s;eamen were taken ill; each of them the morning after they had lain on &s;hore. By the&s;e accidents the men were greatly intimidated from laying on &s;hore, till the &s;urgeon offered to try the experiment on him&s;elf. Next morning, when he awaked, he found him&s;elf &s;eized as the re&s;t, with every &s;ymptom of fever. He immediately acquainted one of the Ne|groes with his &s;ituation, who carried him to his hut, and &s;et him down in the &s;moke of it; when all the &s;ymptoms of fever &s;oon left him: he then took a do&s;e of the Tinc|ture of Bark, and found him&s;elf very well.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="44">
<P>Thus in&s;tructed by the Negroe, he order|ed a large fire to dry the hut he &s;lept in; and afterwards had every night, a &s;mall fire &s;ufficient to rai&s;e a gentle &s;moke, without occa&s;ioning a trouble&s;ome heat; and by the&s;e means, he and &s;everal others u&s;ing the &s;ame precautions, &s;lept many nights on &s;hore without any inconvenience.</P>
<P>I &s;hould next proceed to give &s;ome di|rections concerning the mode of living that ought to be followed by Europeans in warm climates; but as the limits fixed for the&s;e pages, prevent my entering fully into the &s;ubject, I am obliged with &s;ome reluc|tance to conclude this performance, by mentioning that together with the cau&s;es produced by an unwhole&s;ome climate, the exce&s;&s;es of European debaucheries carried into tho&s;e countries, tend greatly to bring on di&s;ea&s;es. Good living is in all countries nece&s;&s;ary to health; but exce&s;s of drinking in a warm climate is a matter of &s;erious con&s;equence. In &s;hort, the utmo&s;t atten|tion &s;hould be paid to cleanline&s;s; to u&s;e food as ea&s;y of dige&s;tion as can be procur|ed, to avoid fatigue, and all exce&s;s in liv|ing.
<PB N="47" REF="45">I therefore beg leave to recommend the advice given by Cel&s;us, as well merit|ing the utmo&s;t attention by tho&s;e expo&s;ed to unhealthy climates.</P>
