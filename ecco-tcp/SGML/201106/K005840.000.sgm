<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon my return to this country, I &s;hould have communicated the following Ob&s;ervations on the U&s;e of Opium; but one opportunity &s;oon offering of exhibiting it in a &s;imilar ca&s;e to tho&s;e in which I had found it &s;ucce&s;sful; and &s;ince
<PB N="iv" REF="3">that three or four others, the la&s;t of which was a very bad ulcerated Throat; I thought it was better to wait the event of the&s;e ca&s;es, than too ha&s;tily to adopt an opinion, which, from its novelty and importance, demanded the mo&s;t guarded circum&s;pec|tion.</P>
<P>As the experienced &s;alutary Effects of Opium in a Di&s;ea&s;e, in which its Effects have hitherto been little known, aro&s;e in mo&s;t in&s;tances from circum&s;tances in the con&s;titution, owing to irregularities inci|dent to a Military Life, I have endeavoured, as far as my experience would lead me, preci&s;ely to determine what the&s;e circum|&s;tances are.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="4">
<P>And as it is to you, Sir, I am indebted for the &s;ituation which afforded me the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, I think it my duty to addre&s;s them to you; and I am extremely happy in this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing <HI>my Gra|titude,</HI> and of a&s;&s;uring you, that I am always, with e&s;teem and truth, Sir,</P>

<PB REF="5">
<P>IN the year 1779 I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, in his Maje&s;ty's General Ho&s;pital at New York, the good Effects of OPIUM, in a variety of ca&s;es, originally Venereal, in which Mercurial preparations appeared to be of no efficacy.</P>
<P>It happened that a great number of &s;ol|diers fell under my care at the &s;ame time, who laboured under evident &s;ymptoms of Morbid Irritability, which might be owing to different cau&s;es; but all the&s;e Patients <HI>were undergoing,</HI> or <HI>had undergone,</HI> a cour&s;e of mercury.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms, in all their variety of appearances and changes, at fir&s;t ari&s;ing from the venereal virus, and terminating
<PB N="8" REF="6">in what has &s;ince, upon rea&s;oning and re|flexion, appeared to me to have been brought on by Morbid Irritability, were all relieved, and finally the cure compleated, by alleviating pain, and procuring re&s;t.</P>
<P>And here I may remark, that &s;oldiers in general are cured of the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e with more difficulty than any other Patients, owing to their ignorance and inattention, or to their de&s;ire of protracting the di&s;ea&s;e, and fru&s;trating the u&s;ual modes of relief.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e in which (as far as I am able to judge from the trials I have made) our expectations are likely to be an&s;wered from the u&s;e of Opium, is when the ulcers are &s;preading, or continue much the &s;ame, with a foul appearance, bad di&s;charge, and much pain, the patient having little or no re&s;t, and all local applications &s;eeming to be of no &s;ervice: to the&s;e &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="9" REF="7">may be added a quick pul&s;e, which is an invariable attendant, being, in gene|ral above an hundred, &s;ometimes an hun|dred and twenty, and &s;ometimes more, in a minute.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t admini&s;tered Opium in ca&s;es of this &s;ort, I had the &s;atisfaction to find, that I gained two material points, viz. Ea&s;e and Re&s;t; with &s;ome in the fir&s;t twenty-four hours, and in general within two days; afterwards, from the&s;e good con&s;equences, I was induced to continue the u&s;e of it, increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing the quantity as occa&s;ion required, and entirely omitting at the &s;ame time the u&s;e of mer|curial applications, either externally or in|ternally.</P>
<P>Without entering into a di&s;qui&s;ition on Opium, I take the liberty of concluding, that it will be &s;ufficient if I am enabled to
<PB N="10" REF="8">&s;tate facts, and mention the u&s;eful effects of this medicine in a di&s;ea&s;e, which is one of the mo&s;t violent that the human body can be afflicted with.</P>
<P>With regard to the action of Opium on the body in this di&s;ea&s;e, I have to ob&s;erve, that in &s;ome patients its effects were &s;udden, in others gradual; in general the circula|tion of the blood was very much decrea&s;ed by it, and &s;ometimes the pul&s;e was ren|dered &s;o &s;low as to beat only fifty and forty times in a minute; but this effect is not always nece&s;&s;ary to the cure, as a good deal will depend upon the patient's di&s;po&s;ition to Irritability, which is the principal thing I attend to&mdash;for I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that as &s;oon as that has been le&s;&s;ened, &s;ome &s;alutary change has been produced on the &s;urface of the ulcer.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<P>Its effects, in a few of the ca&s;es, were almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous; among&s;t the&s;e was that of a young man, twenty-two years of age, who had two Buboes (one in each Groin), which were opened and treated in the u&s;ual way, but continued in an ulce|rated &s;tate for five months, during which time he rubbed in three ounces and a half of &s;trong mercurial ointment, which &s;eemed &s;ufficiently to affect the con&s;titution: a pro|per diet was u&s;ed, and every thing el&s;e di|rected which was thought nece&s;&s;ary at the time. No change being perceived, he was ordered to wa&s;h out, and take purging phy&s;ick, which he did &s;everal times. Three weeks elap&s;ed, and at this period he was not in the lea&s;t emaciated, but remained in full &s;trength and good habit of body. At this time the ulcers were foul, with thick edges, and the di&s;charge from them ichorous,
<PB N="12" REF="10">with con&s;iderable pain; and the patient had little or no re&s;t. I then began with Opium, and gave him the fir&s;t night one grain and a half only, directed a low diet, and dre&s;&s;ed the ulcers in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner; the next day there was no altera|tion: I increa&s;ed the do&s;e of the medicine, half a grain in that day; the following day he was much the &s;ame; but the day after|wards, which was the fourth, a favourable change was ob&s;erved; and, from that time to the expiration of three weeks, gradual changes took place, and both ulcers per|fectly healed, without his having had oc|ca&s;ion to increa&s;e the do&s;e, or to make u&s;e of any other medicine. And here I will beg leave to remark, that with every pa|tient I have avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible &s;uch applications as &s;eemed to make the parts in any way unea&s;y. A &s;oft well-made
<PB N="13" REF="11">bread and milk poultice will an&s;wer in the early part of the treatment, and afterwards dry lint and cerate; but, if a fungus exi&s;ts, I prefer a &s;olution of thebaic extract in an oatmeal poultice, applied cold in contact with the &s;ore, to any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The manner in which the alteration takes place is both curious and &s;ingular; the fir&s;t favourable &s;ymptoms are ea&s;e and re&s;t; the next, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, is an unfolding or loo&s;ening of the texture of the &s;urface of the ulcer after the irritability is le&s;&s;ened, which ef|fect &s;oon takes place, the parts are in a &s;tate of relaxation, owing to the &s;tricture on the &s;urface being relieved, and finally the cure is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;kin corrugating, or contracting to the center of the ulcer, unaided by &s;timulating applications, and,
<PB N="14" REF="12">frequently, with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by the u&s;ual way of a new &s;kin.</P>
<P>In &s;everal ca&s;es I have ob&s;erved the cure go on extremely well, without the &s;urface of the ulcer appearing florid at any one time, as is u&s;ual in healthy-looking &s;ores. I am very happy in this part, in having Mr. Wier's, Surgeon of his Maje&s;ty's Mili|tary Ho&s;pitals, permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, that he has ob&s;erved all the above facts that I men|tion. And &s;ince that, having communi|cated my ideas to Mr. For&s;ter, who is like|wi&s;e Surgeon of his Maje&s;ty's Military Ho&s;|pitals, and who&s;e abilities I re&s;pect, I have much &s;atisfaction in being able to add his opinion in corroborating the above facts; Mr. For&s;ter having ob&s;erved the &s;ame ap|pearances, and changes, that I have en|deavoured to de&s;cribe.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>The third, fourth, or fifth day was the time I in general found the appearance of the &s;ores change for the better.</P>
<P>The do&s;e that I have in general begun with in this di&s;ea&s;e, has been about one grain and a half the fir&s;t night, which I have increa&s;ed night and morning, until I found it an&s;wered the intended pur|po&s;es. With a view of keeping the patient quiet, and le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to move, I always divided the time, and therefore gave it night and morning; and what is very ex|traordinary, the patient in the day-time never appeared to me more drow&s;y than if he were not making u&s;e of the medicine; but with &s;ome an indolency took place, and continued, or di&s;continued, either as the con&s;titution became u&s;ed to the medi|cine, or to the variation of the do&s;e. I confe&s;s my&s;elf, I was always happy when
<PB N="16" REF="14">it appeared; as I never knew any harm accrue from it: and, be&s;ides its own action internally, Opium di&s;po&s;es a re&s;tle&s;s temper of mind, to ob&s;erve a proper regimen, and to obey any directions that may be thought nece&s;&s;ary at the time. I have always ob|&s;erved, that it is be&s;t to keep the patient ignorant of the medicine whil&s;t he is u&s;ing it.</P>
<P>A tremor, which &s;ometimes came on, never obliged me to decrea&s;e the do&s;e, or to pay any particular attention to this &s;ym|ptom, unle&s;s the bowels were di&s;po&s;ed to be co&s;tive; and then a purge readily relieved it in a great mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The preparation that I invariably gave my patients was <HI>Extractum Thebaicum;</HI> if any objection aro&s;e to its being u&s;ed in a &s;olid &s;tate, I preferred di&s;&s;olving the do&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="15">in plain water to the tincture, or any other form.</P>
<P>With regard to the quantity that may be given, I will not determine; I think for the mo&s;t part the di&s;ea&s;e yielded to about four or &s;ix grains a day; I have in two or three ca&s;es given eight grains, and in one extraordinary ca&s;e of a cancerous lip, of near three years &s;tanding, I in|crea&s;ed the quantity to twenty-four grains in a day, divided in three do&s;es; the patient was a man about fifty years of age, and I was &s;ix weeks in bringing him to this do&s;e, which I continued for a few days, and finding that it did not do any material &s;ervice in the progre&s;s of the cure, I di&s;|continued it; yet now and then a favour|able change &s;eemed to appear, for two &s;inu&s;es that I had occa&s;ion to lay open di|ge&s;ted
<PB N="18" REF="16">well, and clo&s;ed; no ill effects were produced by the medicine, excepting &s;ome|times a giddine&s;s, which was always re|lieved by a gentle purge; previous to his making u&s;e of Opium, he had always a quick pul&s;e; but it afterwards decrea&s;ed to between forty and fifty &s;trokes in a mi|nute, and continued &s;o for &s;ome time. And I cannot help being very much of opinion, that had Opium been properly given in the earlier &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, a cure might have been obtained: and in this opinion I am confirmed by a ca&s;e I have lately at|tended; which was an ulcer in the mouth of three months &s;tanding, with all the characteri&s;tic marks and &s;ymptoms of an Incipient Cancer, which was compleatly cured by Opium and Cicuta joined. This patient (Major Sinclair) Dr. Garth&s;hore
<PB N="19" REF="17">attended with me; the fir&s;t time we &s;aw him we agreed in opinion with re&s;pect to the means to be pur&s;ued for his cure, and never had occa&s;ion to deviate from the plan. Before he began the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, he was almo&s;t in a &s;tate of di&s;traction from pain, and his pul&s;e beat an hundred and twenty &s;trokes in a minute. This quickne&s;s of pul&s;e was dimini&s;hed on the third day, and about the tenth the ulcers changed for the bet|ter; and in a month afterwards he was quite well<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Patient drank a decoction of four ounces of Sar&s;aparilla every twenty-four hours during his cure.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Gentle Purges frequently become ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the early part of u&s;ing the medicine, though in a &s;mall do&s;e, e&s;pe|cially where the body is di&s;po&s;ed to be
<PB N="20" REF="18">co&s;tive; and I have generally found that a little glauber &s;alts an&s;wered the purpo&s;e, as this operated without my being obliged to delay the u&s;e of Opium; on the &s;econd or third day with &s;ome a head-ach came on in con&s;equence of the bowels being con&s;tipated; but this always readily gave way to a gentle purge, and I have always found, that as the con&s;titution became u&s;ed to the medicine the pain of the head was no longer an attendant, and in gene|ral the body became regular; nay, with &s;ome a Diarrhoea has been produced, which has continued for two or three days, and that without &s;eeming to do any harm.</P>
<P>An increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of &s;aliva is not uncommon, as well as of urine; it does not depend upon taking a large quantity, for it will happen &s;ometimes in the fir&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="19">&s;ix days; but neither one, nor the other, &s;eems at any time to be injurious, nor does it appear nece&s;&s;ary to forward the cure, as patients who have experienced neither of tho&s;e effects have obtained it in as &s;hort a &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>One remark further I mu&s;t add, with regard to diet, viz. that until I procured ea&s;e and re&s;t, I continued the patient on a low diet, which I in general began with; and as circum&s;tances changed afterwards, &s;o I made &s;uch alterations as the con&s;titu|tion &s;eemed to require; &s;ometimes adding meat, and &s;ometimes either a gill of rum in the day, or wine in proportion.</P>
<P>From the above ob&s;ervations it will ap|pear, that I am inclined to confine the good effects of Opium (which are indeed very con&s;iderable) to an advanced &s;tage of
<PB N="22" REF="20">the di&s;ea&s;e, or what, in my humble opi|nion, may more properly be termed <HI>Mor|bid Irritability</HI> &s;imply, in which &s;tate, mer|cury has either lo&s;t its efficacy, or &s;eems to do mi&s;chief; and this irritability may, I apprehend, probably ari&s;e from different cau&s;es, as it certainly may be a que&s;tion, whether there was any Virus of a Vene|real Nature, remaining in the ca&s;es in which I gave Opium: however that may be, the good effects of the medicine were unque&s;tionable; and it will appear that I do not tru&s;t to Opium as a &s;pecific in re|cent ca&s;es, or where any part of the Vene|real Virus might &s;eem to remain; for the la&s;t ca&s;e I had under my care being of &s;o complicated a nature, I joined Mercury with the Opium for the la&s;t three weeks, but not till I had fully and effectually
<PB N="23" REF="21">relieved the &s;ymptoms of Morbid Irrita|bility.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e I allude to was, that of a bad &s;ore throat, which came under my care about &s;ix months ago: the patient was a gentleman about three or four and thirty years of age, and of a thin habit.&mdash;At the time I fir&s;t &s;aw him he was rather in an emaciated &s;tate: he was pur&s;uing a cour&s;e of mercury, which he had began about two months before. I found upon examination &s;everal ulcers in the Fauces, and a large one on the left ton&s;il; a &s;e|vere pain on the forepart of one leg, with the Perio&s;teum thickned&mdash;an eruption on his brea&s;t, his pul&s;e beating an hundred and thirty &s;trokes in a minute; a mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;great anxiety&mdash;and he had not had any &s;leep for &s;ome weeks:
<PB N="24" REF="22">I omitted entirely the whole of the plan he was then upon, and did not give him any thing till bed-time, when he took one grain and a half of Opium, with directions to repeat one grain the morning following. Upon &s;eeing him the next day, before I a&s;ked him a que&s;tion, he cried out, "I am a well man to what I was; I have had no pain &s;ince la&s;t night, and &s;lept well." This formed the foundation of his cure. I increa&s;ed the do&s;e, till he took three grains at night, and two in the morning.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day he made u&s;e of the &s;team of hot water, through the inhaler, which he repeated occa&s;ionally afterwards with evident advantage.</P>
<P>On the third day the ulcers &s;eemed to appear cleaner, and every day afterwards
<PB N="25" REF="23">he gradually grew better, till the twenty-fourth day, when all the parts were heal|ed.&mdash;On the fifth day I ob&s;erved that his pul&s;e was in a natural &s;tate, and it con|tinued &s;o the whole time of his re|covery.</P>
<P>The eighth day after u&s;ing the Opium a &s;pitting came on, and continued eleven days. For a few days he &s;pit about a pint each day. This did not weaken him in the lea&s;t&mdash;from being confined to his bed, he was able to walk about, and every day gained &s;trength. Ju&s;t at this time I directed a quart of very &s;trong decoction of Sar&s;aparilla to be taken every day, which produced a gentle diaphore&s;is; and I continued this plan for &s;ix weeks, and, for the &s;ake of &s;ecurity, for the la&s;t three weeks I joined to the Opium at bed-time
<PB N="26" REF="24">half a grain of Mercurius Calcinatus. In the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t fortnight the erup|tion di&s;appeared, and the thickened Perio&s;|teum gave way to a bli&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the 20th day, I began to decrea&s;e the quantity of Opium.</P>
<P>And from the 24th to the 42d day, when I left it off, con&s;idering him as per|fectly cured, I only gave one grain in the twenty-four hours&mdash;He had occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of purging medicines at dif|ferent times, owing to a co&s;tive habit of body; but the&s;e never interfered with the Opium.</P>
<P>As conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible I will ju&s;t men|tion, among other ca&s;es, the following:</P>
<P>William Rockett, of the detachment of Guards that was in America during the late war, thirty-&s;even years of age, had
<PB N="27" REF="25">ulcers on each ton&s;il, and almo&s;t the whole of the fauces, with violent pains in his bones. The&s;e complaints were of three months &s;tanding; mercurials, and other medicines, had been admini&s;tered during the whole of that time.</P>
<P>He was of a thin habit of body, with a pul&s;e from an hundred and twenty to an hundred and thirty &s;trokes in a minute. He began with one grain and a half of Opium the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P>On the third day, no alteration having taken place, I increa&s;ed the do&s;e one grain.</P>
<P>The next day, to appearance the ulcers &s;eemed not quite &s;o angry; and in every other re&s;pect he was better.</P>
<P>On the eighth day, he appeared weak, and his throat in general relaxed. I
<PB N="28" REF="26" MS="y">omitted the Opium, and began with the Peruvian Bark, in as large do&s;es as the patient's &s;tomach would bear, and or|dered him to make u&s;e of an a&s;tringent gargle.</P>
<P>On the tenth day, the Bark occa&s;ioning nau&s;ea, I was obliged to leave it off. The pain in his bones returning with vio|lence, I again gave him two grains in the morning.</P>
<P>The next day he was better.</P>
<P>On the twelfth day, as he was much the &s;ame, I increa&s;ed the do&s;e, one grain in the morning, and continued this plan to the fifty-&s;econd day, without varying the do&s;e; when every thing &s;eemed to go on &s;o extremely well, and the pains of the bones having left him, I omitted the two grains in the morning.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="27">
<P>In a week afterwards all the ulcers were healed; and he was gaining &s;trength daily. I continued one grain at night for a fortnight longer, and di&s;charged him from the ho&s;pital perfectly cured. It was near a fortnight before the pul&s;e returned to its natural &s;tate; and afterwards it was frequently under &s;ixty.&mdash;This ca&s;e hap|pened among the fir&s;t in the year 1779; and Mr. Ru&s;h, Surgeon to the Second Troop of Hor&s;e Grenadier Guards, and late Surgeon to the Brigade of Guards in North America, was witne&s;s to the whole of the treatment.</P>
<P>Thomas Wells, thirty-&s;ix years of age, of a &s;trong plethorick habit of body, with rather a full pul&s;e, had &s;mall ulcers on the ton&s;ils and fauces, and an ophthalmia, for which he had been &s;alivated without the lea&s;t benefit. I directed for him a low diet,
<PB N="30" REF="28">and began with giving him one grain of Opium night and morning.</P>
<P>The next day he was ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The third day a good deal better.</P>
<P>And on the &s;ixth day, being much the &s;ame, I increa&s;ed the do&s;e one grain at night.</P>
<P>The next day he was going on well, and continued getting better till the four|teenth day, when his throat was quite well, and his eyes much relieved.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth I omitted the Opium in the morning.</P>
<P>And on the eighteenth, as he was nearly well, I omitted one grain at night.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third, the inflammation was gone; and in every other re&s;pect he was perfectly well.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="29">
<P>On the thirtieth day the Opium was en|tirely omitted; and he was di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>April 7th, 1782, I was de&s;ired to &s;ee John Blewers, a &s;ailor, twenty-eight years of age, of a plethorick habit of body, with ulcers on the glans penis, a phymo&s;is, the praeputium in a gangrenous &s;tate, and &s;uf|fering mo&s;t excruciating pain; his pul&s;e beat an hundred and twenty-&s;trokes in a minute, and appeared to be increa&s;ing in quickne&s;s. He had rubbed enough of the mercurial ointment to affect his mouth twice.</P>
<P>I began with two grains of Opium at night and one in the morning.</P>
<P>The next day, he &s;aid he had enjoyed a good night's re&s;t, which he had been a &s;tranger to for &s;ome time.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="30">
<P>On the ninth he was much the &s;ame in appearance; and I directed two grains of Opium to be taken night and morn|ing.</P>
<P>On the tenth he had ea&s;e and re&s;t.</P>
<P>On the eleventh the pain was much relieved; and there was an appearance of part of the praeputium &s;loughing.</P>
<P>On the twelfth he was not quite &s;o well; and the do&s;e of Opium was now increa&s;ed to three grains night and morning.</P>
<P>Thirteenth, he was better.</P>
<P>Fourteenth, the &s;lough was thrown off; and he was better in every re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Fifteenth, he was in a good &s;tate, and continued going on well till the eighteenth of May, when the ulcers being nearly healed, I decrea&s;ed the do&s;e of Opium to four grains a day.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="31">
<P>Twentieth and twenty-fir&s;t, I decrea&s;ed the do&s;e two grains more.</P>
<P>Twenty-fifth, he was quite well, but continued to take a &s;ingle grain a day for a week longer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above, I had the &s;atisfaction of effectually relieving, with the &s;ame manner of treatment, ten other patients; of whom, &s;ix had either ob&s;tinate or &s;preading ulcers in the groin; one an ulcerated glans penis; and three ulcerations of the ton&s;ils and fauces.</P>
<P>HAVING remarked, that in ca&s;es where fungus exi&s;ts I prefer a &s;olution of thebaic extract in an oatmeal-poultice, made and applied cold, I beg leave, as proofs of its peculiar efficacy, to add the two following
<PB N="34" REF="32">ca&s;es; neither of which, as far as my en|quiries went, originated from the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>I&s;aac Pratt, twenty years of age, had a very large ulcer on the fore part of his right leg, with a fungus at lea&s;t an inch high on one part, inclining to the in&s;ide of the leg, and of a hard texture.&mdash;This ulcer, which came on after a long inter|mittent fever, began with an inflamma|tion, attended with &s;mall white bli&s;ters. It grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and when I fir&s;t &s;aw him was of thirteen months &s;tanding. The Peruvian Bark, and other medicines, were occa&s;ionally made u&s;e of, as &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, as were al&s;o a variety of external applications (including a tight bandage),
<PB N="35" REF="33">without producing any favourable change, though the patient recovered his health in every other re&s;pect. The di&s;charge from the ulcer was ichorous, and at times the pain was very great; but at intervals he was perfectly ea&s;y; his pul&s;e was never affected, excepting when he was in pain.&mdash;Conjecturing that Morbid Irritability might be the cau&s;e of the ulcers continuing in the &s;ame bad &s;tate, I left off the u&s;ual dre&s;|&s;ings, and in their &s;tead applied to the &s;ore an oatmeal-poultice, prepared with a &s;olution of thebaic extract, in the propor|tion of three drachms of the latter to eight ounces of cold water. This dre&s;&s;ing I re|newed twice a day; and I likewi&s;e began with giving him internally one grain of Opium night and morning.&mdash;This was on the 25th of February, 1780.
<PB N="36" REF="34"></P>
<P>On the 28th no alteration was produced. I increa&s;ed the do&s;e to two grains night and morning.</P>
<P>March 3d, no alteration being ob&s;erv|able, I increa&s;ed the do&s;e of Opium to three grains night and morning: at this time I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give him a purge.</P>
<P>On the 5th, there &s;eemed to be an ap|pearance of a favourable change.</P>
<P>During the five following days the changes for the better, though &s;low, were very evident; and, upon applying my finger to the fungus, I felt that it was not quite &s;o hard as before. At this time ano|ther purge was thought nece&s;&s;ary, and the patient continued till the latter end of April, gradually getting better.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="35">
<P>The &s;ame do&s;e of Opium, viz. three grains, was con&s;tantly exhibited; and now and then, as occa&s;ion required, a &s;mall do&s;e of &s;alts, which always an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of procuring &s;tools when well diluted.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May the fungus was to|tally gone, and the ulcer nearly healed.</P>
<P>On the 5th, I decrea&s;ed the do&s;e of Opium to two grains in the day.</P>
<P>On the 7th, I decrea&s;ed it to one grain.</P>
<P>And on the 8th I entirely left it off.</P>
<P>On the 20th, the ulcer was perfectly cicatrized. I had continued the poultice till within &s;ix days of the cure, and then applied cerate.</P>
<P>About eight months afterwards, I &s;aw this man, and he informed me, that his leg had continued well from the time he was di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="36">
<P>This ulcer healed without having had at any one time a florid appearance.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e, with others that I have had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, together with the remarks of my colleagues Me&s;&s;rs. For&s;|ter and Wier, will, I flatter my&s;elf, be &s;uf|ficient to make Surgeons le&s;s fearful of the probability of a cure being obtained, and le&s;s de&s;irous of u&s;ing &s;timulating applica|tions, with a view of producing the change to a florid, or what is commonly termed healthy &s;tate of an ulcer; for, as far as I am able to judge, by &s;o doing the cure will be protracted.</P>

<P>March 16th, 1780, Abraham El&s;tone, forty-one years of age, was received into the General Ho&s;pital, with an ulceration on
<PB N="39" REF="37">the whole &s;urface of the chin and left &s;ide of the lower jaw, with a fungus of nearly the thickne&s;s of half an inch, irritable to the touch, and extending univer&s;ally over the ulcer, and attended with an ichorous di&s;charge. He had been &s;ix weeks in this &s;tate.&mdash;He informed me, that at two or three different times, in the early part of his life, he had been &s;ubject to an en|largement of the maxillary glands, which had always been &s;oon relieved.&mdash;The Sur|geon, who&s;e care he was under for the pre&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;idered the ca&s;e as &s;cro|phulous, and treated it accordingly, with|out any &s;ort of benefit, as the ulcer con|tinued to &s;pread, and was rendered exceed|ingly painful by the growth of the patient's beard.&mdash;I directed one grain of Opium to be admini&s;tered night and morning, and
<PB N="40" REF="38">likewi&s;e recommended the u&s;e of an opiate poultice cold, as in the former ca&s;e: this method was per&s;evered in till the twentieth, but without any alteration, although the do&s;e of Opium was increa&s;ed to four grains night and morning.</P>
<P>On the 25th, there &s;eemed to be an appearance on the ulcer for the better.&mdash;I increa&s;ed the do&s;e of opium to five grains night and morning.</P>
<P>From the 25th of March to the 3d of April, the patient complained le&s;s of pain; and from the 4th to the 18th of April, the fungus was gradually decrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>On the 23d, the di&s;charge was changed for the better, and the fungus was nearly gone.</P>
<P>And on the 25th, there was not the lea&s;t appearance of fungus remaining, and
<PB N="41" REF="39">the parts were perfectly ea&s;y and re|laxed.</P>
<P>About a fortnight afterwards the ulce|ration was quite healed, and I laid a&s;ide the poultice; but I did not begin to le&s;&s;en the do&s;es of opium till the 23d of May; after which time I went on gradually di|mini&s;hing them, till the patient omitted them altogether; and on the 12th of June I di&s;charged him from the ho&s;pital per|fectly recovered; and eighteen months afterwards I had an opportunity of enquir|ing after him, and had the plea&s;ure to find he had continued well.</P>
