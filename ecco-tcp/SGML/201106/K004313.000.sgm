<P>HAVING, in the fir&s;t part of this work, gone through the &s;everal properties of the va|rious kinds of food, and &s;hewn how far they agree or di&s;agree with different con&s;titutions, we proceed now, according to our promi&s;e, in order to complete this treati&s;e upon health, to con&s;ider Exerci&s;e, Re&s;t, Excretions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for let us ever be &s;o ob&s;ervant of the former, unle&s;s we pay a careful attention to the&s;e, we &s;hall not be able to keep our&s;elves well. We &s;hall treat of them, therefore in their turns, and we will begin with,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<HEAD>EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>Now, in the human Sy&s;tem, there is a certain quantity only of living power that can be produced for the health of the body; &s;o that if we exhau&s;t that power, we debilitate or weaken the body. A man, for example, may walk, till he can walk no longer: it is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to know how far Exerci&s;e is &s;alutary; but let us fir&s;t con&s;ider the great benefits procured by it.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e encrea&s;es the natural heat of the body, and thus excites and dilates the &s;pirits, making them far more vigorous and active.</P>
<P>It empties the &s;tomach and promotes the ap|petite for the next meal; for, as in &s;edentary habits, dige&s;tion does not quite clear the &s;to|mach, but leaves part of the food, which often clogs and di&s;turbs it; exerci&s;e will excite this to pa&s;s away, and the &s;tomach being thus di&s;charged of tho&s;e relicts, the appetite &s;harpens and craves food very &s;trongly. This naturally &s;trengthens the powers of the &s;tomach, and we dige&s;t our next meal better.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<P>It al&s;o excites an expul&s;ion of excrements, not &s;uffering any &s;uperfluous matter to lodge in the body.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e opens the pores, and gives a free per&s;piration, which too much re&s;t will &s;hut up. Nature has appointed the&s;e vents, and &s;ecret ways of evacuation, to clean&s;e the habit of the body; which in a little time would be clogged and be|come very foul and impure, by an accumulation of &s;uperfluous humours.</P>
<P>It, in the la&s;t place, promotes and adds greatly to the nutrition of the body. We find by expe|rience, that active, &s;tirring people, have a fre&s;her countenance, a greater flow of &s;pirits; nay their fle&s;h is firmer and their limbs &s;tronger, than what is generally met with in per&s;ons that lead a &s;edentary, idle and &s;luggi&s;h life; for it is a maxim univer&s;ally known and received, that a fre|quent exertion of the original powers, in any one part of the body, tends to &s;trengthen that part. For example, the legs of a dancer &s;hall be &s;trong and lu&s;ty, when his arms &s;hall be weak and &s;mall, and the arms of a black&s;mith or water|man &s;hall be mu&s;cular and powerful, while their legs &s;hall fall away. The rea&s;on of this is very evident: exerci&s;e circulates the blood and nutri|tive
<PB N="4" REF="8">juices, gives them a free pa&s;&s;age to all parts of the limbs &s;o exerci&s;ed, and drives off all &s;u|perfluous humours, that, without it, would be de&s;tructive. But,</P>
<P>Such exerci&s;e is to be cho&s;en, as &s;uits be&s;t with the nature of each per&s;on's body, &s;ome requiring exerci&s;e of the upper parts mo&s;t, others of the lower parts, and &s;ome equally of both; but that is generally mo&s;t advantageous, that exerci&s;es every part, as dancing, fencing, riding, tennis, ringing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now, whatever be our exerci&s;e, tho&s;e whom good fortune has enabled to take it or not, would do well to attend to the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e &s;hould be daily in the morning; al|ways with an empty &s;tomach; and, if po&s;&s;ible, after excremental evacuation; for the heat of the body, opening the ve&s;&s;els, may otherwi&s;e draw foul humours into the blood and occa&s;ion very dangerous ob&s;tructions. For this rea&s;on, it is not &s;o well to take any extraordinary exerci&s;e upon a full &s;tomach, or till the inte&s;tines are clear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though any great exerci&s;e after meals is injurious, to walk gently is exceedingly whole&s;ome, for, b^^o this means, our food will de&s;cend to the bottom of the &s;tomach, the natural heat of the body will be encrea&s;ed, and dige&s;tion will go on the better. Where per&s;ons can retire after meals into the &s;weet air, and &s;uch delightful places as exhilerate the &s;pi|rits, tis right to do it. If the &s;tate of the body be &s;uch, as that we cannot walk after meals, it will be right to &s;tand up, at lea&s;t, according to the old ver&s;e,
<Q>"Po&s;t pa&s;tum &s;tabis, pa&s;&s;u mollive meabis."</Q>That is, &s;tand up after meals, or walk gently.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P>Exerci&s;e &s;hould be varied according to your con&s;titution and the &s;ea&s;on of the year. Young, &s;trong, robu&s;t per&s;ons, in cold weather, admit of greater exerci&s;e; old, weak and thin per&s;ons, in hot weather, of le&s;s; for the fatter and gro&s;&s;er the body is, &s;o much the more is the natural heat dimini&s;hed, and exerci&s;e more nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;|&s;olve the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture of the body, which occa&s;ions gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, and to encrea&s;e the circulation of the blood. Circulation being naturally bri&s;ker in the &s;ummer, exerci&s;e is le&s;s needful, but more &s;o in the winter, as the moi&s;ture of the &s;ea&s;on will &s;ometimes occa&s;ion ob&s;tructions in the lungs and brea&s;t, which &s;trong and laborious motion will often remove.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e, opening the pores, we &s;hould be careful not to u&s;e it in a damp air, le&s;t we take in &s;ome of its noxious qualities, that may do us
<PB N="6" REF="10">harm; neither &s;hould we expo&s;e the body, after it, le&s;t we catch cold, but the&s;e things are &s;o well known, that they need not be further explained.</P>
<P>Another nece&s;&s;ary caution to be ob&s;erved, is, that exerci&s;e be not too violent, nor continued longer than it is a plea&s;ure; but that we de&s;i&s;t before we be weary, or &s;weat too much.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who from age or infirmities are unable to take exerci&s;e, &s;hould rub their bodies, morning and evening, with flannel or coar&s;e linen gloves. All parts may be rubbed, except the &s;tomach and belly; rubbing the&s;e will di&s;turb dige&s;tion and offend the head. We may apply a warm cloth to them in the room of it. The loins of the back likewi&s;e &s;hould not be rubbed, unle&s;s we feel them cold, and then but gently, le&s;t they &s;hould be over-heated and ob&s;tructions in the uri|nary pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould en&s;ue. In this operation we &s;hould begin &s;oftly and ea&s;ily, encrea&s;ing the mo|tion and weight of our hand, as the tenderne&s;s of the &s;kin will permit, till the fle&s;h, as it were, &s;well and be &s;omewhat ruddy, and then de&s;i&s;t; for too much rubbing will bring on an inflamma|tion. Was every per&s;on, well or ill, to rub them|&s;elves in this manner, once or twice a day, for a
<PB N="7" REF="11">little while, they would never omit it; for they would find them&s;elves glow with a natural warmth, their limbs would be active and their joints &s;upple. It is for this rea&s;on, that children are rubbed, who can take no exerci&s;e; and experience teaches us, that the currying and rubbing a hor&s;e, not|with&s;tanding his exerci&s;e, is a great addition to his health. In cold and moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons the head al&s;o &s;hould be rubbed with a coar&s;e linen cloth, warmed.</P>
<P>Thus having &s;et out the times for exerci&s;e and motion, let us proceed to con&s;ider</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>REST.</HEAD>
<P>Re&s;t is as nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve health, and con|tinue us in &s;trength and vigour, as exerci&s;e. When the body is fatigued, re&s;t is refre&s;hing, and renews its &s;trength; but when &s;atiated with re&s;t it thir&s;ts again for motion and agreeable exerci&s;e. Re&s;t is a burden, if forced upon nature longer than it re|quires. <HI>Interdum quies, inquieta e&s;t,</HI> &s;ays Seneca, even re&s;t &s;ometimes is irk&s;ome. For if exerci&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of health, too much inactivity mu&s;t be prejudicial. <HI>Ignavia corpus hebetat, labor firmat.</HI> Sluggi&s;hne&s;s makes the mind and body dull and heavy, whereas frequent mo|tion &s;trengthens and invigorates them.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="12">
<P>The life of man, conver&s;ant in change, &s;pends its whole cour&s;e in &s;leep and watching; the one appointed for re&s;t and ea&s;e, the other for action and labour. If he was con&s;tant in the fir&s;t, his life would be only the &s;hadow of death; if in the la&s;t, he would &s;oon be exhau&s;ted. Nature therefore hath wi&s;ely contrived, that man &s;hould not long continue in either, but wear out his life between the two.</P>
<P>Sleep is a placid &s;tate of body and mind, giv|ing refre&s;hment and ea&s;e to both; for as an ex|ertion of the faculties either of mind or body exhau&s;ts our powers, re&s;t will re&s;tore tho&s;e powers. The powers of the mind are like a &s;mall current, which is &s;ufficient to keep up a continual motion. If we want to give this wa|ter greater power, we dam it up, and when the water is run from the dam, if we wi&s;h to produce a fre&s;h power, equal to the fir&s;t, we &s;hut the &s;luices, and collect the water again: &s;o it is with the mind, in &s;leep. In perfect &s;leep, both the body and mind are at re&s;t, excepting in tho&s;e particu|lars, where an exertion is nece&s;&s;ary to life; and in &s;leep, it is that the body receives a greater degree of nutrition; it is then dige&s;tion takes place in an extraordinary degree, and recruits
<PB N="9" REF="13">tho&s;e &s;pirits that were exhau&s;ted in the cour&s;e of the preceding day.</P>
<P>Now that &s;leep may prove advantageous, an|&s;wering the intentions and de&s;igns of nature; let us con&s;ider four things concerning it. The time when it &s;hould be taken; the nece&s;&s;ary limits, or quantity of &s;leep required; the &s;alubrity of the place, and the po&s;ition of the body.</P>
<P>The time mo&s;t proper for &s;leep, is, according to the appointment of nature, the night, when creation, in general, take its re&s;t. At the &s;hutting up of the day, when the &s;un gets below the horizon; the &s;pirits are not &s;o active and lively, but incline to a ce&s;&s;ation. Tis then they return to the centre of the body and apply them&s;elves to what is called concoction; that is they return to perform their vital operations, to nouri&s;h and refre&s;h the &s;y&s;tem. For during the heat of the day, they are dilated and extended to the external or circumferent parts. Hence, we find, that, towards midnight, unle&s;s we are in exerci&s;e, put on another garment, or encrea&s;e the heat of the room, we always find our&s;elves chilly. In the morning again, at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, our &s;pirits are naturally fre&s;h, bri&s;k and active. If we therefore, prevert the order of
<PB N="10" REF="14">nature, turn day into night, by keeping late hours, and laying in bed, all the morning, we do that which is greatly de&s;tructive to our con&s;titu|tion. For as &s;leep naturally draws the animal heat inwards, and the heat of the &s;un counteracts this power, by drawing it outwards; &s;leeping in the day is a re&s;i&s;ting of nature, which mu&s;t be prejudicial to the health of the body. Sleeping in the day, therefore, is a bad cu&s;tom, particu|larly for fat, corpulent people; but if the &s;pirits be fatigued with care or bu&s;ine&s;s, or by rea&s;on of old age, weakne&s;s of nature, extreme hot weather, labour, or the like; then mo|derate day-&s;leep is a good refre&s;hment, but take it rather &s;itting than lying down, becau&s;e the head will be le&s;s offended with the ri&s;ing vapours. Neither &s;hould it be taken immedi|ately after dinner, but an hour or half an hour after, at lea&s;t; and between dinner and our nap, it would be prudent to walk a little. Thus will our food de&s;cend better into the &s;tomach and be le&s;s liable to affect the head. Neither &s;hould this afternoon's nap be longer than half an hour, or an hour at mo&s;t, le&s;t the animal heat &s;hould be &s;o collected from the outward parts, as to cau&s;e a heavine&s;s in the head: neither &s;hould it be taken in a hot place, but in one cool rather, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer time, as &s;hall hereafter be &s;hewn.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="15">
<P>Sitting up late is one of the great de&s;troyers of the con&s;titution; it tires and wa&s;tes the animal &s;pirits, by keeping them too long upon duty; weakens nature, ha&s;tens on the effects of old age, changes a fre&s;h, florid countenance into a &s;allow one; heats and dries the body, breeds rheums and bad humours and is particularly injurious to thin people.</P>
<P>By going early <HI>to</HI> a&s;leep and early <HI>from</HI> it, we ri&s;e refre&s;hed, lively and active. Sleeping late in the morning, keeps that excrementitious matter in the inte&s;tines which ought to be eva|cuated and thus occa&s;ions ob&s;tructions and noi|&s;ome vapours, which greatly offend the head, dull the &s;en&s;es and are very pernicious to the whole body. If our nece&s;&s;ities indeed oblige us to &s;it up late, our &s;upper &s;hould be little, and we may make amends for it by laying an hour or two longer in the morning; but let what will happen, we &s;hould always be up by nine o'clock.</P>
<P>In order that &s;leep may be peaceable and re|fre&s;hing, we &s;hould be careful to go to bed with a free and quiet mind, and bani&s;h the thoughts of all manner of care and bu&s;ine&s;s. How often has a train of thinking di&s;turbed a man's re&s;t, and kept him awake the whole night! The body
<PB N="12" REF="16">and the mind is recruited in proportion to the &s;oundne&s;s al&s;o of &s;leep. The more we dream the le&s;s are we refre&s;hed. Although re&s;t is not complete at the beginning, it has a tendency to become &s;o, during this &s;tate of the body; that is to a quiet mind, &s;leep becomes &s;ounder and &s;ounder. When a man fir&s;t falls a-&s;leep, he dreams, to&s;&s;es and tumbles about; gradually he becomes more quiet, and were we awake him, he would not recollect that he had been dreaming at all, or he would tell us, he dreamed, but in a &s;mall de|gree. During &s;leep the original power appears to be &s;o much accumulated, as to give a di&s;po|&s;ition to action, both to the mind and body, from the &s;lighte&s;t cau&s;e; &s;leep then leaves us and we awake: that is, when the powers are recruited, the organs begin to be affected, and the man dreams afre&s;h; at la&s;t, outward objects &s;en&s;ibly affect him and he awakes. 'Tis then the mind is fitte&s;t for action; the judgment is then &s;tronger, the imagination more lively and as the evening comes on, the&s;e powers are gradually dimini&s;hed, and require fre&s;h &s;leep to recruit them.</P>
<P>The next thing that falls under our con&s;idera|tion, is the quantity of &s;leep we take. This has been in &s;ome mea&s;ure noticed; but it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to be a little more particular. It
<PB N="13" REF="17">cannot indeed be determined how long we may &s;leep; as in all other things, a mediocrity is be&s;t. Our &s;leep &s;hould be proportioned to our health, our age, the complexion and emptine&s;s or fulne&s;s of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>As the nutrition of the body is particularly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;leep, we &s;hould &s;leep, in general, till the food we take has performed its office; that is, till what phy&s;icians call concoction is completed. This may be di&s;cerned on our awaking by the &s;en&s;ible lightne&s;s of the body, e&s;pecially the head; the emptine&s;s of the &s;to|mach, and a certain de&s;ire of evacuation, pro|vided it is not unnaturally occa&s;ioned. Heavi|ne&s;s of the head and eyes, or a ta&s;te of our la&s;t meal, &s;ignify that we have not &s;lept a &s;uf|ficient length of time. In &s;hort, &s;ix, &s;even or eight hours is long enough for young per&s;ons in health, but &s;uch as are &s;ickly and weak require longer re&s;t, nine, ten or eleven hours. Children and old men require more &s;leep, in general, than young or middle-aged per&s;ons; children, that their growth may the better be promoted, and old men, becau&s;e it le&s;&s;ens the dryne&s;s of their con&s;titution. The &s;ame rea&s;on holds good with lean people, to whom more &s;leep is nece&s;|&s;ary than to &s;uch as are fat; for &s;leep moi&s;tens
<PB N="14" REF="18">and refre&s;hes the whole &s;y&s;tem. In a word, as im|moderate &s;leep, or &s;leep taken at improper times weakens the natural heat, loads the head with vapours, detains the excrements longer than is whole&s;ome, makes men &s;luggi&s;h and heavy|headed, de&s;troys the memory and &s;ubjects them to the pal&s;y, lethargy, &amp;c. &s;o too little &s;leep dries up the con&s;titution, dims the &s;ight, wa&s;tes the &s;pirits and de&s;troys all the powers and facul|ties both of mind and body. It mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved, that we &s;hould not go to bed upon a full &s;tomach; that is, not go to re&s;t too &s;oon after &s;upper; but continue up an hour or two, till our food be half dige&s;ted; if we are obliged to &s;up late, we &s;hould eat the le&s;s: for, on account of the natural heat of the body retiring inwards during the time of &s;leep, a full &s;tomach will oc|ca&s;ion a &s;uperfluity of vapours, and greatly offend the head. Be&s;ides, great &s;uppers are very apt to occa&s;ion heart-burn, which will of cour&s;e de|prive us of our re&s;t.</P>
<P>A matter occurs here; whether it be beneficial or not to have our bed warmed? Per&s;ons in years, &s;uch as are weak and tho&s;e who lead a tender and delicate cour&s;e of life, do right to warm their beds, in cold and moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons of the year; and that for two rea&s;ons; that the body, on putting

But this cu&s;tom is unwhole&s;ome to tho&s;e per&s;ons who are healthful and &s;trong, be|cau&s;e it will very much weaken them.</P>
<P>When we ari&s;e in the morning we &s;hould find it amply compen&s;ate for our trouble, were we gently to rub our brea&s;ts and &s;ides downward with our hands, and the re&s;t of our body more &s;trongly with flannel or a hot linnen cloth, particularly our joints. Doing this will quicken the blood, &s;trengthen the parts and excite the natural heat. When ri&s;en, we &s;hould &s;tretch our&s;elves out, that the animal &s;pirits may be dilated to the exterior parts of the body, walk a little up and down, that the remaining contents of the &s;tomach may more &s;peedily de&s;cend; this done, we &s;hould pro|ceed to clean&s;e our no&s;e, by blowing it; to clear our brea&s;t, by expectoration, and to make every other nece&s;&s;ary evacuation. We &s;hould wa&s;h and and plunge our eyes in cold water, for this not only clears away the filth, but &s;trengthens and pre&s;erves the &s;ight. The mouth &s;hould be well clean&s;ed with the &s;ame, and the teeth rubbed
<PB N="16" REF="20">with a dry coar&s;e cloth, after fir&s;t &s;couring them with a &s;age leaf, dipped in vinegar. This will purify the breath, and pre&s;erve the teeth from foulne&s;s and decay: and la&s;t of all the head &s;hould be combed, that the pores may be opened to expel &s;uch vapours, as were not con&s;umed by &s;leep.</P>
<P>The next thing to be mentioned is the &s;alu|briety of the place we &s;leep in. A high room, dry, &s;weet and well-aired, free from &s;moke and remote from noi&s;e, is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome: nei|ther &s;hould our chamber be hot, for the &s;pirits and natural heat of the body, which is drawn in|wardly by &s;leep, as before-mentioned, will be counteracted by any extraordinary heat in the room; but it &s;hould be moderately warm, and free from damps, either natural or artificial, ari&s;|ing from new plai&s;tered walls, wa&s;hing the floor or otherwi&s;e. It may not be ami&s;s here to men|tion the danger of &s;leeping in the open air or on the ground, as many in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on do. Tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tations in life oblige them to it, as &s;oldiers, though for the pre&s;ent they e&s;cape the mi&s;chief, are frequently afterwards made &s;en|&s;ible of the injury, by aches, &s;tiffne&s;s or weakne&s;s of limbs, and many other infirmities that pro|ceed from it.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="21">
<P>Our beds may be &s;oft, but &s;hould not &s;ink in, as that will &s;uck from the body, exhau&s;t and im|pair our &s;trength. A mattra&s;s upon a feather-bed is both ea&s;y and whole&s;ome. As bedding receives the vapours, and &s;weaty moi&s;ture of the body, we &s;hould be careful that it is always clean, &s;weet and well-aired; for if it is not purified by air or fire, it will contract an ill &s;cent and become un|whole&s;ome. If every one ought to be thus care|ful of the beds they con&s;tantly lie in them&s;elves, we may &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is that travellers &s;hould be cautious how and where they &s;leep. No bed-chamber &s;hould be wa&s;hed in cold, wet or foggy weather; &s;weeping and bru&s;hing is &s;uffici|ent to keep it decent, and airing it in clear, dry days, by opening the windows, will prevent its becoming offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>As to the nature of our covering at night, it &s;hould be according to the &s;ea&s;on of the year. The head &s;hould be covered &s;ufficiently to pre|vent its taking cold, but not too warm, le&s;t it weaken it and ha&s;ten grey hairs; for if the va|pours i&s;&s;uing from the brain are impeded in their pa&s;&s;age, it will cau&s;e the hair to turn grey, much &s;ooner than it otherwi&s;e would.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our manner of laying; we
<PB N="18" REF="22">may in a great mea&s;ure con&s;ult our own ea&s;e. The head &s;hould be higher than any other part of the body; the bed from head to feet, &s;hould be &s;mooth and even, without any fall below the pillow, or hollow under the &s;houlders. Sleeping generally on the back is unwhole&s;ome, as the hu|mours of the head naturally fall by this means into the hinder part of the brain and may di&s;or|der it, and the loins are thus more heated than they would otherwi&s;e be, and of cour&s;e the urinary pa&s;&s;ages more &s;ubject to ob&s;tructions. Per&s;ons afflicted with the &s;tone &s;hould by no means &s;leep on their backs. Sleeping with the back up|wards may be occa&s;ionally good for &s;uch per&s;ons as are troubled with wind and have a weak di|ge&s;tion, the bowels being thus kept &s;o much the warmer; but to tho&s;e who have weak eyes it is pernicious, as a defluxion of humours may thus fall into them. The mo&s;t whole&s;ome method of &s;leeping, is on the &s;ide, fir&s;t on the left &s;ide, e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who go to bed before they have dige&s;ted their &s;upper, as the food will in this ca&s;e better de&s;cend to the bottom of the &s;tomach; and then on the right, that the motion of the heart may be free&s;t from pre&s;&s;ure. But the principal thing to render &s;leep comfortable, is, as was hinted before, to compo&s;e the mind. If we lie down with roving, troubled thoughts, they will
<PB N="19" REF="23">commonly calls us up, before it is fit to ri&s;e, and our &s;leep will not be piacid or refre&s;hing. When we lay by our cloaths, therefore, let us not lay a&s;ide our bu&s;ine&s;s, care and thoughts, and let not a wandering fancy break our re&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been often doubted, whether it be good to &s;leep with the mouth a little open. Some there are, that altogether deny it; but to &s;leep with the mouth open is certainly beneficial, and that, for the&s;e three rea&s;ons: becau&s;e the breath pa&s;&s;es more freely and the fuliginous fumes are better &s;ent forth than di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. Hence it is that &s;uch as &s;leep with the mouth open, have a &s;weet breath, whereas tho&s;e that &s;leep with it &s;hut, have generally an offen&s;ive breath and foul teeth. The &s;econd is, becau&s;e &s;ome bad moi&s;ture may in &s;leep pa&s;s forth at the mouth, which if &s;hut, would fall upon the lungs and be prejudicial. The third rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e owing to the de&s;cent of rheumes from the head, the free pa&s;&s;age of the breath through the no&s;e may be impeded, and &s;norings, and offen&s;ive routings en&s;ue, that may di&s;turb us of our re&s;t, and awaken us.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the tongue, palate and gums of &s;uch as &s;leep with their mouth open, are com|monly afterwards very dry and covered with &s;li|my
<PB N="20" REF="24">matter, though in fact, tho&s;e who &s;leep with their mouth &s;hut are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it, all per&s;ons in the morning, &s;hould wa&s;h their mouths and teeth well and gargle their throats, and then eve|ry inconvenience is removed.</P>
<P>The only thing further to be enquired into, upon this &s;ubject, is whether &s;weating at night be de&s;tructive to the con&s;titution or not. Great &s;weats are undoubtedly weakening, but light &s;weats are a great benefit, for gro&s;s humours are thereby di&s;|&s;olved, wind is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the blood is purified, the &s;pirits are refre&s;hed, the cramp, pal&s;y, gout, &s;welling of the joints and other parts, achs, numbne&s;s and heavine&s;s of the limbs are prevent|ed, and con&s;equently the whole body better pre|&s;erved, lively, and in health.

<HEAD>EXCRETIONS or EVACUATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>All that the &s;tomach receives is not fit to be retained; our food, though &s;tudiou&s;ly cho&s;en and temperately u&s;ed, is not all converted into the &s;ub&s;tance of the body; but &s;ome part of it is,
<PB N="21" REF="25">to be &s;eparated and &s;ent forth; the re&s;t is to &s;up|ply and nouri&s;h.

<P>The general excretions of the body are the &s;tool or <HI>faeces</HI> and the urine, and for ea&s;e and health they ought to be daily evacuated. If our habit be naturally lax, it is a happine&s;s, provided that laxity be not immoderate; for &s;uch per&s;ons as are continually co&s;tive, and have &s;eldom the benefit of nature, in the re&s;pect we are now talk|ing of, are liable to many di&s;orders.

<HEAD>Whence it is that &s;ome who are very hungry and have good appetites, eat little; while others, hav-little appetites, each much?</HEAD>
<P>THIS proceeds from the difference of &s;to|machs. A man, with a &s;mall &s;tomach, that will hold but little, will be &s;atisfied with a &s;mall quantity of food; whereas one, with a large &s;tomach, though he &s;eems not hungry, yet when he comes to his meal, will eat plentifully.</P>
<P>A &s;tomach naturally cold, will crave more than it can dige&s;t. On the contrary, a hot &s;tomach has but little appetite, for heat de&s;troys it.

<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e of drink is to pre&s;erve natural moi&s;ture, and to make good a mix|ture and di&s;tribution of meat, that it may dige&s;t the better. For the&s;e rea&s;ons it &s;hould be mode|rately taken at meals. Sundry little draughts are more whole&s;ome than two or three large ones. Large draughts at meals makes the food fluctuate in the &s;tomach. This with its weakening and relaxing the coats of the &s;tomach, de&s;troys di|ge&s;tion. Great draughts al&s;o le&s;&s;en the natural heat of the &s;tomach, drives the food down too ha&s;tily, and corrups the whole body with too great moi&s;ture and crudity.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="29">
<P>It will not be improper to mention here, that &s;uch per&s;ons as accu&s;tom them&s;elves to taking &s;oup the fir&s;t thing at a meal, would do well to take it as hot as they can, as the heat will be very comfortable to the &s;tomach.

<P>Drinking after meals, unle&s;s we are dry, is a pernicious cu&s;tom, e&s;pecially if we drink during dige&s;tion is taking place, as it de&s;troys the na|tural heat that is working in the &s;tomach.

<HEAD>The utility of taking phy&s;ic in the &s;pring.</HEAD>
<P>THE winter by its moi&s;ture naturally fills the body with crude and excrementitious hu|mours, and by its coldne&s;s thickens and &s;tagnates the &s;ame; and the approaching &s;pring working on tho&s;e humours, rarifying and di&s;&s;olving them, they are apt to fluctuate and putrify in the body, which, unle&s;s by the force of nature, or the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of medicine, are often the cau&s;e of &s;ick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the uncertainty of the weather in &s;pring, its &s;udden alterations from hot to cold, and from dry to moi&s;t, will frequently produce feveri&s;h di&s;orders, according to the di&s;po&s;ition of the matter congealed as it were in the body during the preceding winter.

<HEAD>Some ob&s;ervations upon drunkenne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim e&s;tabli&s;hed upon good rea&s;on, that <HI>every thing exceeding its ju&s;t bounds, is hurtful to nature.</HI> The be&s;t of things are not ex|cepted in this general rule. Even the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>&s;upports</HI> of life, if not qualified and made whole|&s;ome by this corrective, may prove the <HI>procurers</HI> of death.</P>
<P>Drink, when carried to exce&s;s, is no longer a refre&s;hment, to moi&s;ten or water the thir&s;ty bo|dy; nor a pre&s;ervative; but becomes an inunda|tion, to drown and &s;uffocate the vital powers, and is the cau&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s. It puts a man out of a &s;tate of health, and di&s;orders him &s;o much, that we may con&s;ider him as going to die.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by &s;ome ancient phy&s;icians, that to be drunk, once a month, is good phy&s;ic and whole&s;ome, as by overcharging the &s;tomach it provokes vomiting and &s;o carries off what may
<PB N="29" REF="33">be there lodged, that would otherwi&s;e breed di&s;|ea&s;e; but this a poor plea for drunkenne&s;s; that for the gaining one &s;uppo&s;ed benefit, (which might be obtained by other means) we &s;hould run the ri&s;k of bringing on twenty di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s is certainly a di&s;ea&s;e, for it has all the requi&s;ites to con&s;titute a di&s;ea&s;e, and is far di&s;tant from a &s;tate of health. For if health be the free and regular di&s;charge of the functions of the body and mind, and &s;ickne&s;s a weak and imperfect di&s;charge of tho&s;e functions; then ebriety may properly be &s;aid to be a di&s;ea&s;e or &s;ickne&s;s; it having the &s;ymptoms of an acute di&s;ea&s;e; for, during the time of drunkenne&s;s and &s;ome time after, few of the faculties perform their office righly.</P>
<P>If we examine the intellectual faculties, we &s;hall find the rea&s;on gone, the memory lo&s;t or bewildered, and the will &s;trangely perverted.</P>
<P>If we look into the &s;en&s;itive faculties they are al&s;o di&s;ordered; their functions impeded, or very defectively performed. The eyes do not &s;ee well, the ears hear well, nor the palate reli&s;h, &amp;c. The &s;peech falters and is imperfect; the &s;tomach throws up its contents, or nau&s;eates;
<PB N="30" REF="34">the legs fail, and the whole man is out of order.</P>
<P>Now, according to the&s;e &s;ymptoms in other di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hould judge the patient not likely to live, or we &s;hould deem his recovery very difficult. Surely then drunkenne&s;s, for the time it la&s;ts, mu&s;t be a very great di&s;ea&s;e. But be|cau&s;e it does not in general prove mortal, or continue long, it is thought little or nothing of, and is con&s;idered as a trival matter, that will cure it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, why drunkenne&s;s is not u&s;ually mortal, &s;ince the &s;ame &s;ymptoms in other di&s;ea&s;es would be accounted &s;o?</P>
<P>To this we an&s;wer; all the hopes we have that a drunken man &s;hould live; is fir&s;t, becau&s;e com|mon experience &s;hews that drunkenne&s;s is not mortal; &s;econdly, from the nature of the cau&s;e, (&s;trong drink) which though it rage and &s;trangely di&s;compo&s;e the man for a time, yet it la&s;ts not long, nor is it commonly mortal. The inebriat|ing &s;pirits of the liquor, flowing in &s;o fa&s;t and joining with the natural &s;pirits of the man, oc|ca&s;ions a tide, &s;o high as to overflow all the banks and bounds of order; but the&s;e adven|titious
<PB N="31" REF="35">&s;pirits are &s;o amicable and friendly to our bodies, in their own nature, as not to be equally deadly injurious, with that which is not &s;o fami|liar. Be&s;ides, their being &s;o very volatile, light, and active nature, much &s;ooner recovers her&s;elf, than if the morbific matter were more &s;olid, ponderous, and fixed. And, further,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e bad &s;ymptoms in other di&s;ea&s;es are more to be feared, becau&s;e they depend, perhaps, up|on malignant cau&s;es; &s;uch as, by time, may be rooted in the con&s;titution, or from the defection of &s;ome principal part; but the &s;torm ari&s;ing from drunkenne&s;s, as it is &s;uddenly rai&s;ed, &s;o common|ly it &s;oon abates.</P>
<P>But though drunkenne&s;s be not mortal, nor the danger, perhaps, great for the pre&s;ent; yet drunken bouts frequently repeated, their relicts will accumulate, weaken nature, and lay the foundation of many chronic di&s;ea&s;es. Nor can it be expected otherwi&s;e; &s;o that we may ju&s;tly conclude, from the manife&s;t irregular actions which appear to us externally, that the internal functions and their motions are &s;trangely di&s;or|dered: for outward madne&s;s proceeds from in|ward impul&s;es and di&s;ordered motions of the fa|culties; which general di&s;turbance mu&s;t of cour&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="36">overturn the oeconomy of nature, and con&s;e|quently ruin the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The ill effects ari&s;ing from intoxication, are a changing of the natural tone of the &s;tomach, a de&s;truction of its dige&s;tive powers, and degene|ration of the nutritive part of our food. Com|mon experience tells us, that, after a drunken debauch, the &s;tomach lo&s;es its appetite, and readine&s;s of dige&s;tion, and, of cour&s;e, nau&s;ea, belching, and thir&s;t en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Great drinkers generally acquire an unwhol|&s;ome corpulency of body, or a lean confumptive con&s;titution; few of them e&s;cape. So great a dependance is there upon the &s;tomach, that other parts cannot perform their duty, if this leading principal part be perverted and debauched.</P>
<P>Now that different habits of body &s;hould ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, is owing to the different di&s;po&s;ition of parts: for in &s;ome per&s;ons, although the &s;tomach be vitiated, yet the &s;trength of the &s;ub&s;equent dige&s;tions is &s;o great, from the vi|gour of tho&s;e parts de&s;tined to &s;uch offices, that they act &s;trenou&s;ly, though the matter on which they act be tran&s;mitted to them imperfect and degenerate, and do therefore keep the body

<P>Others, on the contrary; who&s;e parts are not &s;o &s;trong, lo&s;e the benefit of nutrition, and fall away. Hence it is that by exce&s;&s;ive drinking one man &s;hall puff up, fill, and grow drop&s;ical; while another pines away, and becomes con&s;ump|tive.</P>
<P>A third injury, and a common one ari&s;ing from intemperate drinking, is a weakne&s;s of the nerves, brought on by di&s;orderly motions of the animal &s;pirits. Thus we &s;ee the inconve|niences and mi&s;chiefs attendant upon intempe|rance.</P>
<P>Drinking together is the pledge of friend&s;hip, and to be made drunk is the characteri&s;tic of a generous and hearty entertainment: for, mo&s;t commonly, drinking concludes the fea&s;t. When nature has been tempted with varieties, and per|haps overcharged with them; the next folly is to di&s;turb and inebriate the &s;pirits, vitiate the fer|mentation, and precipitate the food out of the &s;tomach by a flood of liquor, before dige&s;tion be fini&s;hed; that if you have e&s;caped a &s;urfeit by eating, you &s;hall not go away without a mi&s;chief
<PB N="34" REF="38">by drinking; thus your good dinner is &s;poiled, and in&s;tead of being benefited by it, you are in|jured, and your friends civility becomes your de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>But to the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es of drink appointed by nature, we have invented others, and made it &s;erve for plea&s;ure, for profit, for wantonne&s;s, and debauchery. So that drink, which &s;hould help to &s;upport, nouri&s;h, and maintain the &s;trength and vigour of nature, is made an unhappy in|&s;trument to abu&s;e and injure the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>However, as of drinking and drunkenne&s;s we have enumerated the evils, let us not be &s;o par|tial as to &s;mother the benefits.</P>
<P>Drinking advances the revenue of exci&s;e and cu&s;tom. Makes barley bear a good price, and helps the farmer to pay his rent. It keeps the phy&s;ician and apothecary in employ, and doubt|le&s;s adds con&s;iderably to their bu&s;ine&s;s; and is the &s;upport of many a publican. But whether drinking ought to be promoted, to forward the&s;e advantages, with the de&s;truction of health, the &s;hortening of life, and the debauchery of the people: we leave the reader to judge.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE SMOAKING of TOBACCO.</HEAD>
<P>TOBACCO is an herb of great antiquity and reputation among the Indians of America. It is al&s;o called <HI>Nicotian;</HI> but the name, Tobacco, was given it by the Spaniards, from an i&s;land on which it plentifully grew, and that of Nicotian, by the French, from one Nicot who fir&s;t made them acquainted with it. The Indians call it <HI>Petun</HI> or <HI>Petum,</HI> which is indeed the be&s;t general name to give it, deriving it from the Latin word <HI>Peto,</HI> it being far fetched and much &s;ought after.</P>
<P>It is an herb, hot and dry in its nature, and, we believe of a de&s;tructive or venomous quality, for being taken any way into the body, it cau&s;es &s;uch a di&s;turbance as to occa&s;ion violent vomiting and purging, &s;tupefying the &s;en&s;es and benumb|ing every part. The&s;e effects do not proceed from the temperature of the herb, but from the very e&s;&s;ence of it. Common experience con|vinces
<PB N="36" REF="40">us of its &s;tupefying quality; for &s;moaking to &s;uch as are not u&s;ed to it, will bring on a drun|en-like lightne&s;s of the head and, if per&s;i&s;ted in for any length of time, will occa&s;ion a &s;leepine&s;s of the whole &s;y&s;tem. Now as the benumbing effect of a plant generally ari&s;es from the cold|ne&s;s of its quality, and as Tobacco is of a hot nature, it is evident that its &s;leepy quality is not owing to its temperature but its very &s;ub&s;tance. However, there is in the juice of this herb a clean&s;|ing and healing property, and it is very effectual in the cure of any fre&s;h wound, or old &s;ore.</P>
<P>If it be objected by tho&s;e who accu&s;tom them|&s;elves to &s;moke or chew tobacco, that they find none of the&s;e injurious qualities I have menti|oned, let it be con&s;idered, that it is owing to ha|bit, for by a con&s;tant u&s;e of it, they in time ren|der them&s;elves in&s;en&s;ible to its effects, in the &s;ame manner as the Turks do, with re&s;pect to their chewing opium.</P>
<P>The Indians, from whom we learned the man|ner of &s;moaking, accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to u&s;e to|bacco, only when they were much fatigued with labour or exerci&s;e, or when the wi&s;hed to foretell things to come. For the &s;moke's lulling them to
<PB N="37" REF="41">&s;leep and creating &s;undry dreams; on their awak|ing, they found them&s;elves refre&s;hed, and from their wandering thoughts during their in&s;en&s;ibi|lity, they fondly conceived, they could progno|&s;ticate the event of any bu&s;ine&s;s they took in hand or any matter of importance they wi&s;hed to know.</P>
<P>Their method of u&s;ing it was this. Having dried the leaves, they ca&s;t them on the coals, and with a cane received the &s;moke of them by the mouth and no&s;trills till they fell into a drunken trance or &s;leep, in which they continued three or four hours, according to the quantity of &s;moke they had taken in. After which they found them&s;elves lightened and refre&s;hed, and were able to return to their labour or exerci&s;e as before.</P>
<P>But we &s;moke tobacco for no &s;uch purpo&s;e; where one per&s;on takes a pipe medicinally, a hundred do it for plea&s;ure to pa&s;s away the time. And as this is done indi&s;criminately at all times and by all ages and con&s;titutions, very often to the injury of health, a few ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ubject, can be no le&s;s profitable than plea&s;ing.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="42">
<P>Notwithanding there is &s;omething injurious in the nature of tobacco, and it leaves a di&s;agreea|ble &s;mell and &s;avour behind it; yet it is beneficial to &s;uch per&s;ons as are of a cold, moi&s;t con&s;titu|tion, and troubled with rheums, e&s;pecially in cold, damp weather, and when u&s;ed moderately; for it will expel wind, di&s;&s;olve and di&s;&s;ipate cold humours, rai&s;e the &s;pirits, ea&s;e pains in the teeth, &s;wellings of the gums and aches of the joints; and if the &s;moke be &s;wallowed, it will &s;peedily cure a &s;urfeit, by cau&s;ing a &s;udden evacuation both upwards and downwards. But to &s;uch as are not of a cold and moi&s;t con&s;titution, nor affected with rheums, tho' it be only taken in at the mouth and immediately ejected, it is unwhole&s;ome, as its heat will greatly affect the brain and di&s;turb the animal &s;pirits. As to &s;wallowing the &s;moke, un|le&s;s medicinally, or by way of phy&s;ic, it is ab&s;o|lutely pernicious both to the &s;tomach and the lungs, for it di&s;turbs dige&s;tion and tends to dry up the &s;oft and &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs. If any one therefore has habituated him&s;elf to this idle practice, let him in&s;tantly leave it off, for though he may find no great inconveniencies ari&s;ing from it, while he is young and &s;trong, yet he may be a&s;&s;ured, when it is too late to re|pair the injury, he will di&s;cover that it has ruined his con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="43">
<P>There are two or three cautions to be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;moaking, which &s;hall conclude the whole; one is, that in drawing the &s;moke, they take care that they &s;uck it not &s;uddenly into their throat or windpipe, as in &s;uch ca&s;e it will much offend and di&s;turb both the lungs and the mouh of the &s;tomach. Another caution is in returning the &s;moke from the mouth, to take care it does not outwardly affect the eyes, for it will do them a great deal of injury. A third caution, not to go abroad into the air for half an hour after they quit their pipe, e&s;pecially if the &s;ea&s;on be cold or damp, for the tobacco will open the pores of the head, and the &s;udden acce&s;s of the cold air may do a great deal of mi&s;chief. Hence we may &s;ee how idle and fooli&s;h &s;uch per&s;ons act, who walk or travel with a pipe in their mouths. In the la&s;t place, &s;uch as are of a dry, lean con&s;titution, &s;hould &s;hun the u&s;e of tobacco totally, for its dry|ing nature mu&s;t be de&s;tructive to &s;uch habits.</P>
