<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;curvy, though a di&s;ea&s;e very common to the inhabitants of this i&s;land, has not till of late been properly a&s;certained. The variety of &s;ymptoms which occur in it, have occa|&s;ioned it to be confounded with almo&s;t every chronic di&s;ea&s;e, where its nature was not properly under&s;tood. Of late it has been de&s;cribed with great accuracy and judgment by Dr. Hulme and Dr. Lind, in&s;omuch, that I &s;hall recommend my readers to their ob&s;ervations, and at pre|&s;ent dedicate this e&s;&s;ay to the &s;ervice and attention of tho&s;e who &s;eem infatuated with the belief that &s;ea-water is their only remedy.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to give a hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e as it u&s;ually appears, and enter &s;o far into the pathology, as to prove that &s;ea-water tends to increa&s;e it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that more than half the people who vi&s;it Margate and Bright-helm&s;tone, to drink the &s;ea-water, have not the true &s;curvy, as I have often ob&s;erved di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin are confounded with it. Nay, it very often happens, that in the &s;pring a ra&s;h breaks out, which, though it indicates high health, and &s;hews an equal di&s;tribution of the blood to the &s;urface, yet the patient (if I may call him &s;o) has been unea&s;y till he has been fre|quently purged by &s;ea-water to rectify his blood.</P>
<P>The &s;curvy is oftene&s;t found in people of a phlegmatic habit of body, and ari&s;es from a luxurious way of life; it generally ap|pears by the colour of the face, which changes gradually from the natural clear|ne&s;s,
<PB N="3" REF="4">and becomes yellowi&s;h and bloated, but the&s;e &s;ymptoms will occur from a pe|culiar temperament, and exi&s;t many years without any material alteration either for better or wor&s;e&mdash;but when it ari&s;es as a &s;ymptom of true &s;curvy, it is attended with pro&s;tration of &s;trength and dejec|tion of &s;pirits, with a remarkable la&s;&s;itude and aver&s;ion to motion; upon moving &s;uddenly, the patient finds a difficulty of breathing, with more or le&s;s of a palpi|tation of the heart; but before the&s;e &s;ymptoms have continued long, the di&s;|ea&s;e begins to appear in the gums, they turn red and &s;pongy, are attended with itching, and bleed upon the lea&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, the patient's breath becoming at the &s;ame time remarkably foetid; the &s;kin is now covered over with &s;pots of a different magnitude, of a livid colour, not unlike the appearance of a brui&s;e; they are &s;pread over the whole body, but affect the thighs and legs more than the face. The legs generally &s;well and become
<PB N="4" REF="5">oedematous near the ancles, and upon being pre&s;&s;ed, they leave the mark of the finger behind, much in the &s;ame manner as in the drop&s;y, but the impre&s;&s;ion here continues much longer. The pul&s;e is u&s;ually &s;mall and irregular, and rarely exceeds the common &s;tandard; the ap|petite is weak, and the patient upon lying in a recumbent po&s;ture, with his mind calm and undi&s;turbed, finds a re|markable ce&s;&s;ation of his more violent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Before other marks of the di&s;ea&s;e ap|pear, and even through its cour&s;e, the patient is attended with co&s;tivene&s;s, but &s;ometimes a dy&s;entery will break out, which is followed with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. The urine is commonly of a flame colour, &s;mall in quantity, ha|ving often a brown thick a&s;h-coloured &s;e|diment, and &s;ometimes a &s;aline pellicle is &s;ound floating on its &s;urface; in &s;ome ca&s;es the urine gives an irritation in its
<PB N="5" REF="6">pa&s;&s;age: upon bleeding the patient, the blood is commonly found without any texture, and has every mark of being broke down. The intellectual faculties are not much affected, and indeed all the &s;en&s;es &s;eem unimpaired to the la&s;t, and yet the nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;eems much more irritable than when in health, as the patient is one while greatly elevated, and at others as violently depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;uddenly has tran&s;itions from the mo&s;t extravagant boldne&s;s to the mo&s;t childi&s;h pu&s;illanimity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t common &s;ymptoms in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;order; but if from the patient's &s;ituation or circum|&s;tances the di&s;ea&s;e is neglected, innu|merable are the &s;ymptoms which attend it. I &s;hall give the mo&s;t remarkable:</P>
<P>The legs are contracted, and the knees are attended with a painful oedematous &s;welling, fungous ulcers break out in
<PB N="6" REF="7">various parts, but mo&s;tly about the legs; &s;ometimes dry pu&s;tular eruptions, not unlike tho&s;e of the miliary kind, are &s;cattered over the whole body. Wander|ing pains are felt every-where, but there is commonly a fixed pain in the brea&s;t, attended with &s;tricture, which is generally increa&s;ed upon any attempt to cough.</P>
<P>There is an uncommon di&s;charge of &s;aliva, which is greatly increa&s;ed with the &s;malle&s;t do&s;e of mercury. In this malig|nant &s;tage of the di&s;order, the blood be|ing entirely di&s;&s;olved, is poured out on every hand, bur&s;ting through the &s;cars of old wounds which have been healed many years; but very commonly more plenti|fully from the gums, no&s;e, and haemor|rhoidal ve&s;&s;els&mdash;the teeth become loo&s;e and fall out; the callus of old broken bones is di&s;&s;olved, and they begin to loo&s;en; the difficulty of breathing is daily increa&s;ed, and &s;uch is the degree of acri|mony, that the lea&s;t wound made by
<PB N="7" REF="8">accident in the &s;kin becomes a painful ulcer. In this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, a jaun|dice or drop&s;y often &s;upervenes, but much oftener, from an effu&s;ion of &s;erum in the brain, the patient upon the lea&s;t motion of body, or perturbation of mind, is &s;eized with a pal&s;y, which clo&s;es the tragedy, yet retains his faculties to the la&s;t. It &s;eldom happens that the di&s;ea&s;e arrives to this &s;tate on land, the patient having always at hand the u&s;e of fre&s;h vegetables, and other means to obviate its increa&s;e. The common &s;ymptoms which attend people in London are tho&s;e which I have enumerated in the fir&s;t part of the hi&s;tory, being commonly accom|panied with the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing of all di&s;ea&s;es, the hypochondria&s;is; and hence I imagine it is that a journey to the &s;ea|&s;ide has been found &s;o often of &s;ervice, not in removing the &s;ymptoms of &s;curvy, but by engaging the mind with a variety of new objects, obviates the di&s;po&s;ition which &s;uch patients find of cheri&s;hing the idea of their &s;ufferings.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<P>As I offer this e&s;&s;ay to my patients by way of caution, having profe&s;&s;edly un|dertaken it to prove that &s;ea-water in &s;corbutic di&s;orders is not only ineffectual, but even often is attended with bad con|&s;equences, I &s;hall now trace the occa|&s;ional and proximate cau&s;es of the di&s;|ea&s;e. I have hinted before, that people of a peculiar temperament are more &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e than others:&mdash;what tem|perament I mean, is that of the melan|choly, where the patient lives in ea&s;e and opulence, having too much of the enjoy|ments and too little of the difficulties of life to &s;truggle with.</P>
<P>There is one general cau&s;e of &s;curvy which &s;eems remarkably to prevail in the&s;e ca&s;es, and which is, too great a pro|portion of animal diet, which is not &s;o per&s;pirable as vegetables; but &s;alted and high &s;ea&s;oned meats, from cau&s;es we &s;hall enumerate hereafter, tend particularly to produce it, as Lord An&s;on's crew found in
<PB N="9" REF="10">the South-&s;eas. Though the too frequent, or &s;ole u&s;e of animal food tends to pro|duce the &s;curvy, yet it has been ob&s;erved, that dimini&s;hed per&s;piration is a much more common cau&s;e; hence it is, that the further we travel north the more we find the &s;curvy prevail, witne&s;s the Natu|ral Hi&s;tory of Norway, Lapland, and Greenland; and it is a fact, that the fur|ther we travel north or &s;outh, the more we find the &s;curvy prevail or dimini&s;h, and hence aro&s;e the common ob&s;ervation, that the people of Scotland are more &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e than tho&s;e of the &s;outh of England.</P>
<P>The ingenious Dr. Hulme, in his In|augural Di&s;&s;ertation, printed at Edinburgh, confirms this remark, by ob&s;erving that the &s;curvy prevailed among the &s;ailors (while at &s;ea) more or le&s;s according to the height of the thermometer and the &s;tate of the air. He ob&s;erved when the quick&s;il|ver was above &s;eventy degrees, the di&s;ea
<PB N="10" REF="11">&s;eldom or rarely appeared, although the men lived upon &s;alted provi&s;ions. This ea&s;ily explains how a vi&s;it to Southampton will remove &s;ymptoms of the &s;curvy; the &s;ea&s;on cho&s;en as proper is the months of June and July, when the weather is warm, and the &s;pot being the furthe&s;t &s;outh, hence they are more liable to a free and plentiful per&s;piration, which for the pre|&s;ent removes the di&s;order, and the patient returns to town though cured, yet per|haps greatly reduced and weakened by large nau&s;eous draughts of &s;ea-water; and con&s;equently upon the approach of cold bleak ea&s;terly winds he will be more liable to have his di&s;ea&s;e return with renewed violence. I have with pain often ob&s;erved whole families every &s;ummer pay an an|nual vi&s;it to the &s;ea; they have continued the practice for perhaps five or &s;ix &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive &s;ea&s;ons, the con&s;titution every winter becoming more and more enerva|ted, till at length a drop&s;y or jaundice has been the con&s;equence: all which perhaps
<PB N="11" REF="12">might have been obviated by a little pru|dent management during the winter.</P>
<P>Authors have ob&s;erved, that moi&s;ture joined with cold is one great cau&s;e of the &s;curvy; this evidently ari&s;es from its effect in dimini&s;hing per&s;piration, and this may give us one rea&s;on why a &s;corbutic habit is &s;o prevalent in England, as I believe no country is more &s;ubject to &s;udden changes of temperature than Great Britain; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s cold without moi&s;ture has the &s;ame tendency. Moi&s;ture joined with heat is more apt to produce putrid fevers and dy&s;enteries.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the occa&s;ional cau|&s;es of the &s;curvy, I &s;hall endeavour to give an analy&s;is of the blood in its &s;cor|butic &s;tate, and from thence draw a proof that &s;ea-water mu&s;t tend to promote every &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="13">
<P>Dr. Boerhaave, in his chemical lectures, has long &s;ince proved that the blood in its natural &s;tate gave no proof of its abounding with either an acid or alkali, as he could not procure an efferve&s;cence with either the &s;tronge&s;t vinegar or a fixed alkali; he tried another experiment by dige&s;ting the &s;erum of the blood till it became putrid, and he then di&s;covered a volatile alcaline &s;alt; and hence the doctor drew &s;ome plau&s;ible conclu&s;ions with regard to putrid di&s;ea&s;es, but his conclu&s;ions will not bear the te&s;t of examination, though perhaps if allowed it would be very favourable to my theory.</P>
<P>A volatile alkali is always found in the fluids in a neutral form, but that it is ever changed and decompo&s;ed in the ma&s;s of blood during life appears very doubtful; if it is evolved &s;o as to exi&s;t in a &s;eparate &s;tate, it mu&s;t be in con&s;equence of a putrefaction which goes further than is con&s;i&s;tent with life. Dr. Gaubius, an eminent profe&s;&s;or at
<PB N="13" REF="14">Leyden, in his excellent pathology, on this &s;ubject, con&s;iders it not as an alkali evolved, but rather &s;eems to think it may be introduced in its &s;eparate &s;tate; but his arguments, however &s;trong, are ea&s;ily ob|viated; as there is, for &s;ome purpo&s;e of the oeconomy, in every animal more or le&s;s of an acid in the &s;tomach, and it is certainly &s;o, nothing being more evident than that acids formally as &s;uch are often introdu|ced into our bodies, and ace&s;cents &s;till more frequently. The greater portion of our aliment is vegetable, all of which, except perhaps the oily parts is plainly ace&s;cent, and that the acid is truly and in our &s;tomachs &s;eparated I have rea&s;on to think from the experiments of the judici|ous Dr. Ru&s;h, profe&s;&s;or of chemi&s;try at Philadelphia, who has &s;hewn that more or le&s;s of an acid is always formally pre&s;ent in the &s;tomach, though not generally ob|&s;erved: it is a que&s;tion with me, whether the &s;ymptoms we mark as the effects of acidity in the &s;tomach are to be referred
<PB N="14" REF="15">to acidity alone, or to &s;ome other circum|&s;tance that attends the generation of this, as mephitic air, &amp;c. I much doubt whether this acid ever enters the &s;y&s;tem further without being covered; there is no doubt it goes &s;ometimes into the inte&s;tines when the powers which &s;hould cover it are defective, and hence it produces diarrhaeas, cholera, &amp;c. by its irritation. But &s;ome phy&s;i|cians have a&s;&s;erted, that it enters the lacteals, and hence a&s;&s;ign its effects; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I know not the lea&s;t ground to &s;uppo&s;e acidity in the blood. Dr. Gau|bius, in proof of the exi&s;tence of acid, brings the &s;ouring of milk as an argu|ment. I have no doubt but there is an acid materially in the milk, but I a&s;&s;ert not formally till is it evolved by &s;tagnation and putrefaction.</P>
<P>Having thus laid the foundation for a neutral &s;alt in our blood, which ari&s;es from the combination of an alkali in our ani|mal food, joined to a natural acid, I &s;hall
<PB N="15" REF="16">endeavour to convince the reader that it is this &s;aline &s;tate of our fluids which tends to increa&s;e and promote the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>I have in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e ob|&s;erved that the blood is broke down and di&s;&s;olved, and this is the peculiar effect of the ammoniacal &s;alt, to di&s;&s;olve the lymph which gives con&s;i&s;tence to the blood; we have proof of this in the great quantity of &s;erum and its acrid and &s;aline &s;tate, which is ob&s;ervable more particularly in the urine. It has commonly been &s;up|po&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent me|dical writers, that the &s;corbutic &s;tate is the putrid &s;tate of our blood, but I mu&s;t here carefully di&s;tingui&s;h it: I confe&s;s that there is rea&s;on to believe that this &s;aline &s;tate of our fluids is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards putrefaction; but the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t deplorable &s;curvy furni&s;hes no putrid ferment, and what is more re|markable, it is no where contagious: but there is another argument of con&s;i|derable
<PB N="16" REF="17">weight, that the &s;erum of &s;cor|butic blood has been found to re&s;i&s;t pu|trefaction when applied to other &s;ub|&s;tances; there is another circum&s;tance in &s;curvy which &s;hews it to be very different from putrid, which overthrows the whole &s;y&s;tem; the &s;curvy has a very &s;low pro|gre&s;s, and will &s;ub&s;i&s;t for years in &s;ome per&s;ons; and from what I have advanced we may obviate &s;ome confu&s;ion that has occurred in the terms alkale&s;cent and putrid. We can only &s;ay, that the alka|le&s;cent &s;tate &s;o much &s;poke of, is no other than the ammoniacal I have been de|&s;cribing.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, that after having advanced &s;ufficient proof that all the &s;ymptoms of &s;curvy are owing to a decompo&s;ition of the blood, the prox|imate cau&s;e of which is too great a quantity of neutral &s;alts; I need u&s;e no further arguments to prove the bad con|&s;equences
<PB N="17" REF="18">attending a too free u&s;e of &s;ea-&s;alt.</P>
<P>The true &s;curvy (which I have de&s;cri|bed) does not exi&s;t on land &s;o frequently as has been apprehended, at lea&s;t to any great degree; and indeed, we have rea&s;on to think that it was much more frequent formerly than at pre&s;ent, which the cele|brated Sir John Pringle attributes to our now making a greater u&s;e of vegetables. Almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e which ari&s;es from irregular &s;ecretion has been confounded with the &s;curvy, and it is this confu&s;ion in the di&s;tinction of di&s;ea&s;es that has given birth to a great deal of bad practice. Phy|&s;icians have hitherto pretty much neglected the &s;tudy of cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es: they have in mo&s;t ca&s;es had the idea of an acrimony in the blood thrown on the &s;kin. This I agree &s;ometimes happens, e&s;pecially in the &s;curvy and in putrid di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;but when we con&s;ider that the generality of di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="18" REF="19">of the &s;kin occur in the winter, when the temperature of the weather is fluctuating from warm to cold, it mu&s;t occa&s;ion a difference in the &s;ecretory organs; if the per&s;piration is remarkably free, we have rea&s;on to think an acrid matter pa&s;&s;es with it, which being &s;uddenly &s;topped by cold, occa&s;ions it to &s;tagnate; and this acrid mat|ter being effu&s;ed under the &s;kin gives a di&s;ea&s;e attended with an intolerable itch|ing, till a new increa&s;e of per&s;piration carries it off.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now enquire into the effects of &s;ea-water, when u&s;ed externally in the form of a bath, in the &s;curvy and di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin, and afterwards draw &s;ome favourable conclu&s;ions with regard to its u&s;e in &s;crophulous di&s;orders. The fir&s;t que&s;tion that ari&s;es is, whether the ad|vantages from bathing in the &s;ea are &s;upe|rior to tho&s;e which follow the u&s;e of water of the &s;ame temperature unimpregnated with &s;ea-&s;alt? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have
<PB N="19" REF="20">never yet found any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e its effects equally advantageous to &s;pring water, where a cold bath was indicated. I am &s;en&s;ible that this is a theory which will &s;urprize many people who have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;omething &s;pecific to exi&s;t in a &s;ea-bath. I am certain from experiments that a large quantity of water may be ab&s;orbed by bathing; but the que&s;tion is, whether &s;ea-water enters in its &s;aline &s;tate; if it does, the &s;ame objections will re&s;t again&s;t it in &s;curvy which I have advanced with regard to drinking it; if it cannot, it fol|lows of cour&s;e that its effects mu&s;t be the &s;ame as tho&s;e of &s;imple water. The imme|diate effect of cold bathing is a gradual warmth and an increa&s;e of per&s;piration; &s;o far it is u&s;eful not only in di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin, but al&s;o in &s;curvy; but if an increa&s;ed warmth is the advantage ex|pected, this will be found more remarka|bly in a colder water; and therefore I ad|vance this as another rea&s;on why cold &s;pring-water &s;hould be preferred as a bath to &s;ea-water.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="21">
<P>However, after all, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge that I believe &s;ea-water u&s;ed as a bath has frequently had a &s;uperior effect to a fre&s;h-water bath; the rea&s;on I take to be this, when a patient enters a bathing machine in the &s;ea, he goes with a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that it is his only remedy; the warmth of the water, the agreeable va|riety of company, all tend to remove that natural dread which mo&s;t people find when they are at home and obliged from a warm bed to go to a &s;olitary bath, where, perhaps, they &s;tand trembling on the brink till they have got a fre&s;h cold before they can be induced to plunge in, and this in a &s;hort time from being irk|&s;ome becomes terrible, and is neglected. Therefore, I am well convinced, that if people would candidly examine the matter without prejudice or partiality, they would agree with me, that in all the di&s;ea&s;es where a cold bath is indicated, &s;pring|water, by being much colder, mu&s;t be greatly &s;uperior to that of the &s;ea.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="22">
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that in advancing this theory I &s;hall di&s;oblige many of the in|habitants of Scarborough, Margate, South|ampton, and other places, but in an e&s;&s;ay of this kind it is nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould be candid. They may perhaps conclude, that for &s;ome intere&s;ted motives I write again&s;t &s;alt-water; I mu&s;t therefore de|clare that my object is truth, not intere&s;t. I mu&s;t now conclude this e&s;&s;ay with re|commending &s;ea-water, and more e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e &s;aline waters impregnated with &s;ulphur, in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and cruel of all di&s;ea&s;es, the</P>

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e, though it differs from the &s;curvy, yet has often been confounded with it, and therefore I &s;hall give a &s;hort hi&s;tory of it, with the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>By &s;ome authors it has been con&s;idered as a new di&s;order, introduced with the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; but I think the &s;trumae
<PB N="22" REF="23">mentioned in ancient medical writings were &s;uch &s;wellings of the glands as we call &s;crophulous: it generally appears like a tumor of a &s;mall &s;ize in different parts of the body without changing the colour of the &s;kin, and at the &s;ame time is for the mo&s;t part free from pain and inflammation; the tumor is move|able under the &s;kin, it &s;lowly advances to an inflammatory &s;tate, and after &s;ome redne&s;s has come on, it is gradual in coming to a &s;uppuration; and after it &s;hows a fluctuation of matter, it is long in opening and changing into an ulcer. It differs very materially from what is called a phlegmon, though it is true that it &s;ometimes has the appearance of a pointed tumor, but it does not (like other inflammatory tumors) come always to a point and open there, but the in|flamed &s;kin breaks at &s;mall and different apertures; when it is thus become an open &s;ore, it affords but little purulent matter, and always with it &s;omething of
<PB N="23" REF="24">a curd or chee&s;e-like &s;ub&s;tance, with a quantity of tran&s;parent and gelatinous &s;erum &s;oon after appearing in it. The ulcer thus formed heals &s;lowly, affording but a little pus, and much of a vi&s;cid tran&s;pa|rent &s;erum; the edges of &s;uch ulcers are &s;eldom regularly circum&s;cribed; being at the &s;ame time free from callus, and may be known by their flatne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s: they thus ari&s;e on the bones near the joints, and affect them with a caries of a particular kind, for while the caries from mo&s;t other cau&s;es is difficult to heal, it &s;eems as if that in &s;crophulous ca&s;es healed up as ea&s;ily as its ulcerations in the &s;oft parts: the&s;e tumors and their con&s;equences affect particular tempera|ments or con&s;titutions; per&s;ons of fair complexions, with light hair more fre|quently than tho&s;e of dark black hair, though &s;ometimes the&s;e latter do not e&s;cape; but in all the &s;kin has a re|markable poli&s;h, is very &s;mooth, the cuticle having a very peculiar finene&s;s;
<PB N="24" REF="25">it attends a certain period of life, from three years old to puberty, though I have &s;een it in a child three months old, it more frequently appears from three to &s;even than afterwards&mdash;After the age of puberty, it may be doubted whether a &s;welling of the glands is of the &s;crophu|lous kind, though there is a &s;pecies that appears about the age of puberty, but then it is always a prelude to con&s;umption of the lungs, and does not require to be treated as &s;crophula. Whenever &s;crophula attacks it rarely continues many years, the mo&s;t u&s;ual period is three or four, and then the ulcers heal; if they do not appear at the age of puberty, they &s;el|dom continue after it. I have thus de&s;cri|bed the di&s;ea&s;e as it mo&s;t commonly ap|pears. The&s;e tumors mo&s;t manife&s;tly oc|cur in the lymphatic or conglobate glands. Every part of the body is liable to be affected, but more frequently the neck. It is a difficult matter to determine
<PB N="25" REF="26">whether the di&s;ea&s;e thus affecting the glands at a particular period of life is not owing to &s;ome change in the &s;ecretory &s;y|&s;tem; it is a &s;erious, if not an important que&s;tion, and well de&s;erves the attention of phy&s;iologi&s;ts. The general opinion is, that &s;crophulous &s;wellings are owing to a morbid matter affecting the glandular &s;y|&s;tem; but if this was the ca&s;e, why &s;hould it occur at a certain period of life, and among people various in their way of living and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>From &s;crophula being commonly at|tended with a thickne&s;s of the upper lip, &s;ome phy&s;icians have &s;uppo&s;ed that the breath was infectious; but the phaenomena of the di&s;ea&s;e by no means confirm this, as children &s;leep together during the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;order without infection.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance attending the di&s;ea&s;e, which confirms an opinion I have long entertained, that &s;crophula primarily
<PB N="26" REF="27">is owing to a di&s;ea&s;e of the glands them|&s;elves, and not to the matter which they &s;hould tran&s;mit; for whatever changes may be made in diet, even after the ineffectual u&s;e of antimonials and mercurials, the di&s;ea&s;e has remained without alteration during the &s;ummer, being more or le&s;s inveterate according to the temperature of the weather; but as the cold weather ap|proached it gradually went off, and in|tirely di&s;appeared at midwinter. This ob&s;ervation I have made in various ca&s;es, and always found it hold good where the di&s;ea&s;e was recent; in &s;ome in&s;tances this fact has failed, but then I have remarked that the winter had been moi&s;t and warm, or the patient too much nur&s;ed. Scro|phulous tumors generally appear about the neck and on the elbows; but from my own ob&s;ervations, I have rea&s;on to believe that in &s;uch patients the me&s;enteric glands are more or le&s;s affected; this I conclude from the &s;welling and hardne&s;s of the abdomen, and the rapid emaciation which
<PB N="27" REF="28">en&s;ues. I have frequently had an op|portunity of &s;eeing young children in this &s;ituation, a remarkable in&s;tance occurred to me lately: a trade&s;man in Whitechapel brought his &s;on to me, he was about five years of age, of a thin, pale, delicate habit of body&mdash;his pul&s;e very rapid, being one hundred and twenty in a cool room when &s;itting &s;till; his abdomen was remarkably &s;welled without any fluctuation; his legs were oedematous; he had towards evening a hectic paroxy&s;m which increa&s;ed towards midnight, and went off in the morning with a copious colliquative &s;weat; his ap|petite was natural, but he &s;hewed a re|markable fondne&s;s for cold liquor, which he drank in great plenty; he was generally co&s;tive, except upon taking &s;ome laxative medicine; and his &s;tools were natural, ex|cept having a mixture of white matter; he had no cough, nor pain in his brea&s;t; was cheerful and lively; his urine &s;hewed no marks of purulency. He had for &s;ome time been under the care of an eminent
<PB N="28" REF="29">apothecary, who had given him calomel and rhubarb powders, &s;uppo&s;ing his di&s;|ea&s;e to ari&s;e from worms, but without any advantage, as the child gradually grew wor&s;e. Upon his application to me, I was convinced that the di&s;ea&s;e would in a &s;hort time prove fatal, as I had rea&s;on to think from the celerity of his pul&s;e, that if an ulceration had not already taken place in the me&s;entery, it mu&s;t in a &s;hort time (as his chylous &s;tools gave me &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe a great degree of conge&s;tion exi&s;ted in the me&s;enteric glands) accordingly he langui&s;hed a few weeks longer, and then expired without pain, the approach to death being remark|ably calm and gradual. At my earne&s;t re|que&s;t I was permitted to open the body; and agreeable to my expectation, I found the glands in the me&s;entery &s;welled in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing manner, &s;o that the child was in fact &s;tarved to death for want of a proper a&s;&s;imilation of chyle. Had this child been managed properly at fir&s;t by
<PB N="29" REF="30">taking &s;aline preparations, in all human probability he might have been &s;aved. Upon enquiry I found that the father of this child had been &s;everely afflicted with &s;crophula in his infancy.</P>
<P>I am well convinced that the&s;e ca&s;es oc|cur more frequently than is imagined; they are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from worms, as it occurs in the &s;ummer, when children meet with plenty of green fruit, which has been long &s;uppo&s;ed to generate worms, though I know not on what foun|dation. But to return to &s;crophula in ge|neral:</P>
<P>From this di&s;ea&s;e being hereditary; from its occurring at a particular period, and attending a peculiar temperament, we may &s;afely conclude it to be con&s;titutional; hence I conceive that it ari&s;es not from a <HI>matter</HI> tran&s;mitted from parents to chil|dren, but from a peculiar form of body.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that in this opinion I differ from many learned and ingenious phy&s;icians, who&s;e improvements will al|ways render their memory dear to the &s;tudents of medicine. I deliver this only as my opinion, &s;ubmitting it to the examination of more judicious and im|partial men. It may perhaps &s;eem a &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion to &s;ome, that I &s;hould pre&s;ume &s;crophula to depend on a peculiar forma|tion of the &s;y&s;tem; but if we examine the &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es which can be traced from father to &s;on, we mu&s;t conclude, that in the various &s;tages of life the &s;y&s;tem un|dergoes different changes nece&s;&s;ary for the animal oeconomy&mdash;if this was not the ca&s;e, how does it happen that the gout, which is a hereditary di&s;ea&s;e, lies dormant till the fortieth year of life? or whence ari&s;es that wonderful change which occurs in both &s;exes at the time of puberty? We every day &s;ee children who&s;e features bear &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance to the parents, that they may be known to be &s;uch among
<PB N="31" REF="32">&s;trangers&mdash;if then it is true that a parent can tran&s;mit to po&s;terity a miniature of him&s;elf externally, why &s;hould a &s;imila|rity in the internal &s;tructure be objected to?</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, I pre&s;ume that &s;cro|phula ari&s;es primarily from a peculiar &s;tate of the glands them&s;elves, and not from the matter they retain. And I pre&s;ume it will be an argument of &s;ome weight with my readers, if I ob&s;erve that &s;crophula exi&s;ts only during a certain period of life, and that it di&s;appears afterwards, owing to &s;ome change in the glands them&s;elves: how, or why this takes place I am uncertain; I only advance it as a fact, and leave it to the &s;pe|culation of men of ingenuity to inve&s;tigate it further.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted that vi&s;cid tenacious diet, and au&s;tere unripe &s;ummer fruits (things contradictory in them&s;elves) have been the cau&s;e of &s;crophula. In&s;ants have been &s;uppo&s;ed to receive the infection from
<PB N="32" REF="33">their nur&s;es, but we have no facts that can be depended on to prove this; be&s;ides, at the time of giving &s;uck nur&s;es have &s;eldom any &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, it has been imputed to humid air, to children being confined too clo&s;e, to a frigid phlegmatic temperament, to drinking &s;now-water, and various other cau&s;es, &s;ome of them without any founda|tion and others very uncertain.</P>
<P>I have in the preceding pages ob&s;erved, that the me&s;enteric glands are generally more or le&s;s affected in &s;crophula: this mu&s;t occa&s;ion a great difference in the a&s;&s;imilating powers; and hence it is that &s;uch people are generally weak and relaxed, the circulation being irregular it mu&s;t occa&s;ion a material difference in the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, and hence the phleg|matic con&s;titution is a con&s;equence of the di&s;ea&s;e, and not a cau&s;e; and this al&s;o will explain why the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on is &s;o very
<PB N="33" REF="34">unfavourable to &s;crophulous habits, and account for that phaenomenon of the di&s;ea&s;e returning at certain periods.</P>
<P>It may be readily &s;uppo&s;ed that I &s;hall find it difficult to alter a natural con&s;titu|tion, change and overturn an operation of nature, and con&s;equently that every me|thod of cure mu&s;t be ineffectual. I mu&s;t acknowledge that all di&s;ea&s;es depend|ing on a peculiar temperament, when they are once e&s;tabli&s;hed are very difficult to eradicate; as we find in the gout, ma|nia, &amp;c. It is true, that there are &s;ome em|pirics in the world who&s;e a&s;&s;urance is be|yond every thing; they have furni&s;hed the hi&s;tory of phy&s;ick with a number of pre|tended facts that may &s;eem to overthrow all dogmatic theory; but if mankind were le&s;s credulous, if they would examine &s;uch hi&s;tories them&s;elves, they would find, I am confident, in nine ca&s;es out of ten that &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es were gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Though a cure of this di&s;ea&s;e (when it is once e&s;tabli&s;hed) may be difficult, yet
<PB N="34" REF="35">there is no doubt but we may by a proper precaution obviate the con&s;equences to be expected from a &s;crophulous con&s;titution, and therefore I mu&s;t here earne&s;tly recom|mend to tho&s;e parents who have been &s;ub|ject to it, to make u&s;e of every precaution before the time when the di&s;ea&s;e occurs in children.</P>
<P>Although I have been &s;trenuous in &s;up|porting a new theory of this di&s;ea&s;e, never|thele&s;s I mu&s;t acknowledge, that in the indications of cure it is nece&s;&s;ary to include tho&s;e remedies which may obviate the ef|fects of acrimony. For it would be ab&s;urd in me to a&s;&s;ert that there are no marks of acrimony in this di&s;ea&s;e; there mo&s;t un|doubtedly are; but the&s;e I con&s;ider as &s;ymptoms of inveterate &s;crophula, ari&s;ing from a &s;tagnation of that matter which &s;hould be tran&s;mitted by the glands; and therefore the indications of cure are,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, Upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;ome acrid matter to wa&s;h it out of the &s;y&s;tem.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, To obviate debility and laxity.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>With regard to the former of the&s;e, the idea of acrimony being the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, has laid the foundation for variety of practice; various have been the remedies pre&s;cribed, many contradictory to each other, and others &s;o weak and inert in them&s;elves, that they could never afford relief in the &s;malle&s;t degree; but as a catalogue of remedies declared ineffec|tual mu&s;t in the recital be di&s;agreeable to my readers, I &s;hall pa&s;s them over with this ob&s;ervation, that if the no&s;trums re|commended by empirics had been infalli|ble in this di&s;order, they never would have &s;unk into neglect and contempt.</P>
<P>The method I have found the mo&s;t effectual for the fir&s;t indication, is the
<PB N="36" REF="37">u&s;e of water, which is a fluid fitted to carry out of the &s;y&s;tem any acrid matter by the &s;everal excretories. Much is to be im|puted to pure elementary water; but per|haps water impregnated with a &s;aline mat|ter fitted to &s;timulate and increa&s;e the &s;e|cretions, is the mo&s;t probable remedy. This &s;hould be u&s;ed during the &s;pring, in &s;uch quantities as the &s;tomach will bear without purging.</P>
<P>It has been often recommended to the patients in this di&s;order to drink &s;ea-water as a purge, in order to clean&s;e the blood (as it is commonly called): this, however, is a practice always u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;ometimes dangerous; for I con&s;ider it as an impo&s;&s;i|bility for a medicine pa&s;&s;ing off by &s;tool to affect the blood or excretories; it is true, that the &s;ea-&s;alt by its &s;timulus may emulge the inte&s;tines and carry off a great deal of mucus, and in that manner may have &s;ome effect on the glands of the me|&s;entery: but here it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="37" REF="38">that all purges mu&s;t have a bad effect, which &s;timulate the inte&s;tines when the glands by being turgid with matter, are in a &s;tate of inflammation; when this &s;tate takes place it may be ea&s;ily di&s;covered by the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, pain, and ten|&s;ion of the belly, and al&s;o by the condition of the external glands on the neck, and therefore I would recommend only as much &s;ea-water to be drank as the patient can bear without vomiting or purging: and this will be be&s;t effected by drinking &s;mall quantities at a time.</P>
<P>As this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to have periodical revolutions, it will be be&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of nature by drinking &s;ea-water very early in the &s;pring before the &s;um|mer &s;ol&s;tice &s;ets in; by following this rule I have known &s;crophulous complaints in time intirely removed. But as it often happens that patients being &s;ituated at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, through various circum&s;tances are incapable of making a
<PB N="38" REF="39">journey at the nece&s;&s;ary period when it is common to vi&s;it the &s;ea-coa&s;t; to &s;uch I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that &s;alt-water can be tran&s;ported at an ea&s;y expence to any inland town in good condition; there is no &s;uch advantage to be had from the &s;ea air as many people have imagined. I have frequently found that tho&s;e pati|ents who &s;taid quietly at home and drank &s;ea-water, received much more ad|vantage than tho&s;e who made a journey on purpo&s;e; the rea&s;on I take to be this, tho&s;e who take up &s;ea-water on the &s;hore generally get fre&s;h water among&s;t it; and therefore I give this caution to per&s;ons who wi&s;h to receive benefit from &s;alt-water, to let a boat be &s;ent off to &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and the water taken up ju&s;t before high tide; thus the &s;alt-water will be got without being diluted with any fre&s;h; with this management, I am certain that it will be a very powerful remedy.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
<P>As this di&s;ea&s;e affects people of all ranks and conditions of life, it mu&s;t &s;ometimes happen, through poverty, that the &s;ick are unable to bear the &s;mall expence of hav|ing the &s;ea-water &s;ent to them at the time it is mo&s;t wanted; to &s;uch I have recom|mended a &s;olution of three parts of Glau|ber's &s;alt to one of common &s;alt in &s;pring|water, which will be a u&s;eful &s;ub&s;titute when &s;ea-water cannot be had.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much on &s;ea-water, I &s;hall now con&s;ider our &s;econd indication, viz. to obviate debility and laxity of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I have in the foregoing pages given my rea&s;ons why patients in the &s;crophula are commonly &s;o much debilitated, and therefore I mu&s;t now remark that tonic remedies are not to be u&s;ed till after the &s;ea-water has been pur&s;ued for a con&s;idera|ble time; the general practice has been to u&s;e them both indi&s;criminately; but I have
<PB N="40" REF="41">never &s;een any advantages accrue from &s;uch treatment. The rule I have hitherto followed in putting the patient on a cour&s;e of &s;ea-water during the months of Ja|nuary, February, and March, and then gradually introducing the tonic remedies, as the &s;ummer advanced, has always been attended with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s. The remedies for this purpo&s;e are:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>Peruvian bark:</HI> in the London Medical E&s;&s;ays we have &s;ome account of the good effects of the bark in &s;crophulous ca&s;es; this induced me to try it, and I mu&s;t acknowledge that I had rea&s;on to think it u&s;eful; I will not pre|tend to &s;ay how it acts on the &s;y&s;tem in general, but I have never found it an&s;wer, unle&s;s taken in powder and in large do&s;es. &mdash;Dr. Fothergill &s;ays, he u&s;ed a decoc|tion of it with &s;ucce&s;s. But when we con&s;ider this as a con&s;titutional di&s;ea&s;e, that is, which goes and comes with the &s;ea&s;ons without the u&s;e of remedies, it
<PB N="41" REF="42">renders a &s;light decoction of the bark a doubtful remedy at the be&s;t.</P>
<P>I have often thought that this circum|&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e going off &s;pontane|ou&s;ly has been the &s;ole cau&s;e of that re|putation which quack medicines have ac|quired.</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Alum whey:</HI> this is a remedy which, after the u&s;e of &s;ea-water, I have found to an&s;wer better than the bark, or any other remedy, taken in the quantity of a tea-cup full three times a day, and continued for &s;ome time during the &s;um|mer months; but I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that when the glands of the neck are painful or inflamed, this and all other tonic remedies will tend to increa&s;e the inflammation; tonics are only indicated in the early &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, when the tumors are &s;mall and moveable.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="43">
<P>In ca&s;e the patient &s;hould become co&s;tive by the u&s;e of this remedy, it may be obviated by taking a large &s;poonful of ca&s;tor oil every morning.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Cold bathing:</HI> the &s;ea-water has by many phy&s;icians been con&s;idered as a remedy of great con&s;equence in &s;cro|phulous ca&s;es. I have no doubt but it has been often &s;erviceable&mdash;but what I have &s;aid on this head when treating of the &s;curvy may be applied here: I pre&s;ume its good effects are intirely to be attributed to the coldne&s;s of the water, and not to any impregnation of it. A gentleman of the faculty (who&s;e judgment I greatly value) having &s;een the foregoing part of this e&s;&s;ay before it went to the pre&s;s, informed me that the general opinion of phy&s;icians with regard to the effect of &s;ea-water, when applied to the &s;kin, was that the &s;ea-&s;alt acted as a &s;timulus; but though this ob|&s;ervation might be allowed to have &s;ome weight in a warm bath made with &s;ea|water,
<PB N="43" REF="44">yet I flatter my&s;elf it will be found to have no foundation when the water is u&s;ed cold. It is a general rule in phy&s;iology that a &s;trong &s;edative al|ways de&s;troys the force of a weak &s;timulus. <HI>Cold</HI> water &s;uddenly applied to the body acts as a very &s;trong &s;edative, and con&s;e|quently it mu&s;t de&s;troy the &s;light &s;timulus which &s;ea-water would otherwi&s;e give.</P>
<P>Others have ob&s;erved that &s;ea-water applied to meat tends to corrugate and harden the animal fibre; hence they &s;ay, that it mu&s;t be a great bracer when u&s;ed as a cold bath&mdash;this may be very true with regard to the operation of &s;ea-water on meat; but &s;urely there is a material dif|ference between the living and dead fibre &mdash;and hence I conclude that in this or any other di&s;ea&s;e, a plain bath of the colde&s;t fre&s;h-water mu&s;t be much more effectual than the &s;ea.</P>
<P>It perhaps would be attended with con|&s;iderable advantages if the patient after he
<PB N="44" REF="45">comes out of the cold bath was to be wiped dry and then rubbed for &s;ome time all over with a fle&s;h bru&s;h till he was thoroughly warm.</P>
<P>There yet remains two other remedies which have been much u&s;ed though with very different &s;ucce&s;s; the cicuta and tu&s;&s;i|lago: the former has been much recom|mended in cancerous ca&s;es, and indeed in indurated tumors; for my own part I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I have never &s;een it attended with any advantage when u&s;ed &s;imply. The general method of combining &s;everal medi|cines to an&s;wer one intention renders all their &s;ingle operations uncertain, as we can|not in &s;uch ca&s;es di&s;cover which of them is efficacious. The tu&s;&s;ilago is a remedy of great efficacy in this di&s;ea&s;e; the expre&s;&s;ed juice, or a &s;trong decoction of the dried herb, as recommended by Dr. Fuller, in his Medicina Gymna&s;tica, has remarkable effects on &s;crophulous ulcers. I have known it u&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s in very inveterate ca&s;es.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="46">
<P>I have thus endeavoured to inve&s;tigate the effects of &s;ea-water in two di&s;ea&s;es, if not the mo&s;t dangerous, yet the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to mankind. I have endea|voured to give a plain detail of tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which occur in each di&s;ea&s;e; and though perhaps I may have digre&s;&s;ed from the main &s;ubject in the practical part, yet I flatter my&s;elf it will not be found the le&s;s agreeable on that account to tho&s;e who are &s;o unfortunate as to labour under either of the&s;e complaints. It remains now that I clo&s;e the &s;ubject, and &s;ubmit it to the judgment of the publick.</P>
