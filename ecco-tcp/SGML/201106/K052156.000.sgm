<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Di&s;covering the great efficacy of the recrements of the body, to the dige&s;tion of our food, the cir|culation of the blood, and the &s;ecretion of the alimentary fluids.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM &s;en&s;ible that few phy&s;icians have exa|mined tho&s;e recrements of the body with that attention, accuracy, and diligence, that a point of &s;o great importance requires; and though they are many and divers, yet they all contribute their &s;hare to the maceration, attenu|ation, and dige&s;tion of our aliments in the mouth; to the greater liquidation of the chyle in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; to the more perfect fu&s;ion of the blood in the veins and arteries; and the better &s;ecretion of the various juices, &s;eparated and collected in the different folliculi or receptacles, &s;ituated in the various organs of the body, and which are ordained by nature, to &s;erve very great, and important u&s;es in the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>The&s;e recrements are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the excremen|titious di&s;charges, as the latter are thrown out of the body, and of no further u&s;e in &s;upport of the &s;everal re|&s;pective parts of the animal, and which therefore are called the excrements: while the former &s;erve many great and nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es in life; &s;o that I que&s;tion whether any animal circulation, &s;ecretion, or excretion, could be carried on, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e recrements; for all the motions of the chyle, blood, and animal juices, would &s;tagnate and &s;tand &s;till in an in&s;tant, were it not for the &s;aliva, bile, pancreatic juice, and divers other fluids &s;ecreted from the arterial blood: And as the&s;e &s;e|creted fluids are the main principles that &s;upport the life
<PB N="iv" REF="3">of animals; &s;o in the mo&s;t noxious, venomous, and poi|&s;onous creatures, where the great mi&s;chief is done by a bite, and the infu&s;ion of a poi&s;onous fluid into the wound, as is done by the viper; then, upon reflection, we di&s;cover that there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a counter poi&s;on, generated and &s;ecreted &s;omewhere in the body it&s;elf, to pre&s;erve this noxious animal from the force and deadly effects of its own poi&s;on.</P>
<P>But of all the various &s;eparations and &s;ecretions, I know none of &s;o much con&s;equence to the body, as that &s;ecreted liquor, we call the &s;aliva, or what is generally meant by the fa&s;ting &s;pittle, as will more clearly appear when we come to &s;peak of its effects and con&s;equences upon the bodies of rational animals; for without this &s;ecreted fluid, we could neither chew our victuals, nor &s;wallow our food into the &s;tomach, nor dige&s;t it, after it was there; &s;o that all the motions of the body will grow dry, &s;tagnate, and be at perpetual re&s;t, were not our &s;everal aliments mixed, attenuated, and &s;ufficiently diluted in the mouth, by the penetrating &s;alts of the &s;alival fluid, before they are &s;wal|lowed down into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>And though of late, we have heard of mighty feats being done by the virtues of crude mercury, tar-water, and divers other quack medicines, &s;old up and down this town, with royal patents, and dignified titles; yet I que&s;tion, whether in the gravel, &s;tone, gout, and rheumati&s;m, there ever yet was, or at this time is; or in times to come &s;hall be di&s;covered a medicine more valuable in the fore|going di&s;ea&s;es, than what I now offer for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>And the patient may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that, if the&s;e rules and cautions, laid down in the following pages, are but rightly pur&s;ued, and duly executed, they will mightily contribute, not only to pre&s;erve him in health, but al&s;o prove extremely efficacious to re&s;tore that invaluable ble&s;|&s;ing, whenever over powered by the force of a di&s;ea&s;e. And, in all the&s;e ca&s;es, I find little occa&s;ion for the u&s;e of medicine, provided the patient eats his cru&s;t punctually in a morning fa&s;ting, and is ob&s;erving of the air, diet and exerci&s;e I have &s;et before him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> Of the Virtues of a Cru&s;t of Bread, eat early in a morning fa&s;ting, with its force and efficacy in relieving the &s;curvy, gravel, &s;tone, gout, rheumati&s;m, and various other di&s;ea&s;es</HEAD>
<P>_I AM now going to &s;peak of a remedy &s;econd to none, in the cure and relief given in the forego|ing di&s;ea&s;es: It may indeed &s;erve other intentions and purpo&s;es as far as I know, but in the gravel, &s;tone, gout, and rheumati&s;m, I know it to be the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t remedy hitherto di&s;covered; and if you join fa&s;ting to this noble medicine, I know none more effica|cious: Would you know this valuable &s;ecret, it is ab&s;ti|nence: I &s;ay ab&s;tinence;&mdash;but by the word ab&s;tinence, I do not mean a mere negative remedy, as if fa&s;ting was to do all the work her&s;elf, by &s;uffering nature, in due cour&s;e of time, to re&s;olve the ob&s;tructions, and, at her lei&s;ure, to dige&s;t off the vi&s;cid juices and corrupt humours; for ab|&s;tinence is only nece&s;&s;ary as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, both to improve the operation, and enable the Cru&s;t of Bread, eat early in a morning fa&s;ting, to exert its virtues with more &s;alutary effects: For all medicines operate be&s;t upon an empty &s;tomach, and few purging medicines are advi&s;ed, if they are greatly efficacious but that they are pre&s;cribed to be taken in a morning early, and the fir&s;t thing that the pa|tient does; and he is often advi&s;ed not to eat till two or three hours after.</P>
<P>I chu&s;e to expre&s;s my&s;elf, in the vulgar manner of &s;peech, becau&s;e the vi&s;ible relief given in the gravel or &s;tone is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the Bread alone, and not to any other a&s;&s;i&s;tant remedy mixed with it in the mouth, or in its pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tomach, and &s;o into the blood: For it is a truth, e&s;tabli&s;hed by con&s;tant ob&s;ervation and expe|rience, that divers per&s;ons, by eating a Cru&s;t of Bread in a morning early, and fa&s;ting two or three hours after it, have received great relief in the gravel; others have de|clared, that under the &s;tone their &s;evere&s;t &s;ymptoms have been mightily mitigated; and &s;ome again, under the mo&s;t painful &s;ymptoms of the gout and rheumati&s;m, have found their pains greatly relieved by adhering to this remedy, and applying chewed bread, well moi&s;tened with the
<PB N="6" REF="5">fa&s;ting &s;aliva, warm to the gouty parts: And I do not &s;peak the&s;e things of two or three people only, that have accidentally been thus relieved, but of hundreds, nay, I may &s;ay thou&s;ands, that within my own knowledge, have received great benefit from this invaluable and &s;alutary medicine.</P>
<P>Now to examine the main point, and enquire upon what principles this great relief is given; for if we con&s;ider the Bread it&s;elf, this concrete can have no efficacy, at one time more than another; if the efficacy, I &s;ay, proceeds from the intrin&s;ical principles of the Bread; for then a Cru&s;t eat at five or &s;ix in the afternoon, or at a proper di&s;tance from our meals, mu&s;t produce the &s;ame effects upon the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; upon the ob&s;tructions of the joints and membranes of the mu&s;cles, that it does, when eat in a morning fa&s;ting; and therefore we are to con&s;ider whether this virtue and efficacy, &s;uppo&s;ed to be lodged in the bread, may not more properly be owing to &s;ome other a&s;&s;i&s;ting cau&s;e, than to the piece of Bread it&s;elf; for we know very well, that the matter of fact is &s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Cru&s;t of Bread, eat early in a morning fa&s;ting, does pro|duce the&s;e good effects in the afore&s;aid di&s;ea&s;es; and if we &s;earch into the virtues of Bread, and con&s;ider what ingredients there is in a Cru&s;t, we &s;hall not di&s;cover any virtues in the Bread, more than to nouri&s;h the body; for the pure&s;t wheat, when changed into never &s;o many dif|ferent forms, only produces a more elegant nouri&s;hment: This is the prime law of its nature, and therefore we can|not &s;uppo&s;e that the Bread it&s;elf can contain any powers capable of producing the&s;e principles of di&s;&s;olution of the gravel, attenuation of the phlegm, and mitigation of the painful &s;ymptoms of the &s;tone; and therefore I mu&s;t con|clude, that the Bread it&s;elf does not contain any principles powerful enough to accompli&s;h that great relief, that is often received from eating a Cru&s;t of Bread in a morning early; for then its great efficacy would &s;en&s;ibly appear, from the great quantities we eat of this aliment, in our &s;everal meals, at morning, noon, and night: And hence I infer, that the good that is known to en&s;ue from eating the Bread, mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of &s;omewhat that accom|panies the Bread, and that we can conceive to be nothing but the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, which leads me to &s;peak of the origin, &s;ecretion, and compo&s;ition of this fluid, or what
<PB N="7" REF="6">we vulgarly call the fa&s;ting &s;pittle; as it is a fluid that &s;erves divers great and important purpo&s;es in the animal</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. II.</HI> Of the origin, &s;ecretion, and compo&s;ition of the Fa&s;ting &s;aliva, as the fluid that fir&s;t mixes with the Bread, in the mouth; in its pa&s;&s;age through the gula; and in its de&s;cent into the &s;tomach, as the &s;ole cau&s;e of the fore|going &s;alutary effects.</HEAD>
<P>I Ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t &s;ection, that few phy&s;icians had &s;ufficiently examined the recrements of the body; and &s;o far looked into the my&s;teries of nature, as to con&s;ider for what purpo&s;es and u&s;es in life, they were &s;eperated and &s;ecreted into their proper channels and receptacles; for we daily perceive, that the &s;aliva, the pancreatic juice, and the bilio&s;e humours, are three liquors &s;ecreted from their re&s;pective organs, that &s;erve great and eminent pur|po&s;es in the animal-oeconomy: and as the &s;aliva, or what we call the &s;pittle, is the la&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the &s;ecretions, &s;o I think it will be proper to examine the nature, properties, and con&s;tituent principles of a fluid, that is often the cau&s;e of con&s;iderable changes and alterations in life.</P>
<P>Now the three grand recrements of the body, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;aliva, bile, and &s;eed, are three principles, that not only pre&s;erve life and health in the individuum; but the la&s;t &s;e|creted fluid is that &s;acred bal&s;am, that has continued the &s;pecies from the beginning of the world to this time, and which will &s;o continue it, to the late&s;t period of nature; and therefore methinks they de&s;erve a more particular en|quiry, than what I perceive phy&s;icians, hitherto, have been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon them: however, I &s;hall in this little tract only proceed to examine the recrements of the &s;aliva, the principles of the juices &s;ecreted in the &s;tomach, and the properties of the bile, as &s;ubjects the mo&s;t proper at pre&s;ent for my enquiry; and &s;hall po&s;tpone the la&s;t to a more convenient opportunity.</P>
<P>However, before we proceed to di&s;cover the powers, efficacy, and operation of the Fa&s;ting Spittle, I judge it highly nece&s;&s;ary that, in the fir&s;t place, we proceed to examine the origin, &s;ecretion, and compo&s;ition of this noble fluid, as it is &s;eperated from the arterial blood: becau&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="7">upon the&s;e principles mo&s;t of its active powers, in a great mea&s;ure, will be found to have their dependance.</P>
<P>The &s;aliva, or what we call the fa&s;ting &s;pittle, is origi|nally &s;ecreted from the arterial blood by two complex glands, called the parotides, which, according to <HI>Steno</HI> and <HI>Nuck,</HI> two accompli&s;hed anatomi&s;ts, lye at the root of the ear, one on each &s;ide of the neck: The&s;e glands &s;ecern the gro&s;&s;er &s;aliva; and by means of a number of little &s;mall tubes, ari&s;ing from the inner coat of the&s;e glands, convey the &s;ecreted liquor into one common duct, which, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the third upper grinder, opens into the mouth, where|by the jaws, tongue, and all the inner parts of the lips, are moi&s;tened with this vi&s;cous, &s;ecreted &s;pittle.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e two large &s;ecretory glands, that fur|ni&s;h out the gro&s;&s;er &s;ecretions for moi&s;tening the mouth in general, there are di&s;covered by later anatomi&s;ts divers other minute, conglobate glands, that &s;ecrete a finer, thinner, and more attenuated fluid: The&s;e have their roots in the polate, tongue, gums, and lips, all who&s;e mem|branes are perforated with little &s;mall tubuli, that let into the mouth a fine, thin, volatile &s;aliva, &s;omewhat more attenuated than the former: However, all the&s;e fountains of the &s;pittle are &s;o commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, upon clo&s;ing of the lips, pre&s;&s;ure of the jaws, and combining or compre&s;&s;ing of the cheeks, &s;queeze out a good quantity of their contents into the mouth, for the &s;eparating, moi&s;tening, and di&s;&s;olving of the aliments we take for the &s;upport of life.</P>
<P>And this is the rea&s;on, why the&s;e glands di&s;charge the greate&s;t quantities of their &s;ecreted liquors, during ma&s;ti|cation, or when we chew our food: becau&s;e then there is not only the greate&s;t pre&s;&s;ure upon the&s;e organs, but, at the &s;ame time, all the parts of the mouth are put into greater motions and compre&s;&s;ions, than at any other time whatever, for to make the experiment if you plea&s;e to grind clo&s;e the teeth, and, at the &s;ame time, compre&s;s your cheeks with the lips, you will readily perceive a larger di&s;charge of &s;aliva to rouze from the&s;e re&s;pective glands, than when the &s;ame lye &s;till, are at re&s;t, and under no compre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, of all remedies pre&s;cribed, we ought not only to at|tempt to know their origin, nature, and production, but al&s;o to endeavour to penetrate into the principles, powers, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">properties they con&s;i&s;t of, whereby we &s;hall be better ena|bled to di&s;cover their manner of action, and the different efforts they exert upon the various organs of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>As to the &s;aliva, when all the different &s;ecretions are inti|mately mixed in the mouth, and formed into one uniform, attenuated, frothy humour; the mixture then appears from experiments, to con&s;titute a fine, thin, volatile, &s;ilver-coloured fluid, and which is &s;ecreted from the arterial blood in the caroted arteries, and called the &s;aliva or &s;pittle.</P>
<P>Upon examination, it appears to be a compo&s;ition of &s;alt, oil, and &s;ulphur, di&s;&s;olved in a pretty large quantity of a &s;ine, thin, attenuated phlegm, very nearly re&s;embling the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;oap water, to which it is very nearly related by the virtues of its qualities.</P>
<P>Under a &s;ound &s;tate of health, it is without &s;mell, per|fectly in&s;ipid, or if it has any ta&s;te, it may properly be &s;aid to re&s;emble the white of an egg: To the touch it is ex|tremely vi&s;cid; ea&s;ily mixes with oil, and therefore is oleo&s;e; it readily evaporates with the lea&s;t force of fire, and therefore contains a large portion of volatile parts; and in its nature is mightily penetrant and ab&s;ter&s;ive, and therefore will de&s;troy even the &s;pericity of the mercurial globles them&s;elves, who&s;e round figures are &s;o difficult to de&s;troy, unle&s;s you apply &s;alts, fire, &s;ulphur, or ingredients of an unctions, adhe&s;ive nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. III.</HI> Of the properties, virtues, and &s;alutary effects of the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, when externally applied to old aches, pains, recent cuts, wounds, old ulcers, corns, &s;ore eyes, and gouty nodes.</HEAD>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the fa&s;ting &s;aliva alone, and as it is &s;e|creted from the &s;alival glands &s;ituated in the jaws and mouth, we &s;hall perceive divers great and remarkable effects to ari&s;e from its application; for this &s;aliva may mo&s;t properly be called the noble Bal&s;am of Nature, as it is a &s;urer relief, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, where outwardly applied, than what mo&s;t people will ea&s;ily be led to believe, that have not them&s;elves tryed its efficacy: I do not de&s;ire to be too &s;anguine upon the virtues of the fa&s;ting &s;aliva;
<PB N="10" REF="9">but &s;hall only beg leave of the reader, to lay down what I know to be matter of fact; and then &s;hall proceed to give a detail of divers very &s;urprizing cures, that one Mrs. <HI>Be&s;tock,</HI> at <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> has done to va&s;t numbers of people, in that neighbourhood, by the outward application of the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, vulgarly called the fa&s;ting &s;pittle.</P>
<P>I am intimately acquainted with a gentleman, that every &s;pring and fall was acco&s;ted with a very trouble &s;ome &s;corbutic tetter; he had taken mercury in all &s;hapes, ad|vi&s;ed with &s;everal phy&s;icians, and by their advice had ap|plied mixtures, ointments, and waters, pre&s;cribed for tettery humours, but without &s;ucce&s;s: At la&s;t, he was ad|vi&s;ed to apply the fa&s;ting &s;aliva every morning, which, in a fortnight's time, effectually cured him.</P>
<P>Nor do I know a better medicine for trouble&s;ome corns. A per&s;on of &s;ome di&s;tinction had a corn on the off &s;ide of his foot, that &s;o &s;hackled his limbs, as almo&s;t to reduce him to the &s;tate of a cripple: He employed the corn-cutter without effect; for every time it was cut it both bled and pained him very much: the&s;e are u&s;ual accidents that hap|pened from a nerve and vein, that entered into the com|po&s;ition of the corn, and who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility and cavity were not totally de&s;troyed by &s;o hard a body He had made u&s;e of plai&s;ters, bal&s;ams, ointments, lotions, and all manner of applications, but to no manner of purpo&s;e: He then accidentally a&s;ked a gentleman's opinion, and was advi&s;ed every night to &s;oak his feet in warm water and bran, and the next morning to apply chewed bread, well moi&s;tened with the fa&s;ting &s;pittle, by way of pultice, which, in a little time, perfectly relieved him; for the corn, in le&s;s than a week, tumbled out by the roots, and he has heard no more of it &s;ince. The like happened to a gentleman that was advi&s;ed to apply the chewed bread, mixed with the fa&s;ting &s;pittle, to a gouty node, which mightily relieved him, and has kept his feet ea&s;y ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e hard excre&s;&s;ences we call warts in the hands, face, and divers other parts of the body, it is an infallible cure, if con&s;tantly u&s;ed. It al&s;o mightily a&s;&s;i&s;ts in relieving &s;ore eyes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e eye-lids from hard drink|ing, are red, angry, and inflamed: In the&s;e ca&s;es, if you do but lightly touch the parts affected, with this noble bal&s;am, every morning, you will find great relief. And
<PB N="11" REF="10">we know, by certain experience, that in all cuts, recent wounds, and accidental hurts, that the fa&s;ting &s;aliva is a &s;overeign remedy: and its penetrant di&s;&s;olving ab&s;ter&s;ive qualities are &s;o great, that if it be &s;ufficiently rubbed with mercury, vulgarly called quick-&s;ilver, it will mortify that mineral, and de&s;troy the &s;pericity of its globles, though one of the mo&s;t active bodies in nature.</P>
<P>But the great cures done by one <HI>Bridget Bo&s;tock,</HI> at <HI>Nantwich</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> by the external application of fa&s;ting &s;pittle, would &s;urmount all credit, and &s;carce gain belief, had we not &s;ufficient atte&s;tations, from &s;everal authentic letters, that put the matters of fact above all di&s;pute; for in a letter from a per&s;on of undoubted cha|racter, he tells us; <Q>"that this old woman, all her life|time, made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to cure her neighbours, and people that lived near her, of &s;ore legs, and other di&s;|orders. But her reputation of late, &s;eems &s;o wonder|fully encrea&s;ed, that people come to her from all parts far and near.

<P>HITHERTO we have con&s;idered the fa&s;ting &s;aliva alone, and as it is applied to the external parts of the body; I am come now to &s;peak of its &s;alutary effects, when it is mixed, combined, and a&s;&s;ociated with the fine fluid &s;ecreted from the glands of the oe&s;ophagus or gula, in its de&s;cent into the &s;tomach; when it is combined with the &s;tomachic juices &s;ecreted from the villous coat of that important organ; and the improvements it acquires, as a di&s;&s;olvent, after it is got out of the &s;tomach into the in|te&s;tines, and there thoroughly mixed with the bile and pancreatic juices.</P>
<P>And it plainly appears, from the ob&s;ervations we have made in the fir&s;t &s;ection, that the bread is little or nothing concerned in producing the&s;e good effects, we &s;o &s;en&s;ibly perceive to en&s;ue, upon eating a Cru&s;t of Bread, in a morning fa&s;ting; nor can the virtues that follow, upon eating that concrete, be properly a&s;cribed to the bread it&s;elf; for it never could be &s;wallowed, did not the fa&s;ting &s;aliva mix with it, and convert it to a pulpous &s;ub&s;tance, and thereby fit it for dige&s;tion; for no dry aliments ever could be &s;wallowed, without a proper portion of the &s;alival fluid, nor do I conceive, that any other liquid men&s;truum would &s;erve the intentions of nature &s;o well as the &s;aliva: And this is the rea&s;on, why the greate&s;t number of &s;alival glands are placed in the mouth, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t quantity of &s;aliva &s;eparated from the&s;e glandural me&s;hes, during ma&s;tication, or the time we are chewing
<PB N="14" REF="13">of our food; for then there is not only the greate&s;t pre&s;|&s;ure and motion in all the parts of the mouth, but the mu&s;cles of the jaws, cheeks, and lips, are more forcibly compre&s;&s;ed, contracted, and put into motion, than at any other time: for the&s;e glandular bodies, the fountains of the &s;aliva, are &s;o commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, upon any pre&s;&s;ure of the cheeks, or clo&s;ing of the jaws, &s;queeze out their contents into the mouth; and, to make the experiment, let any per&s;on grind clo&s;e his gums and teeth, and at the &s;ame time, &s;traitly compre&s;s the mu&s;cle&s;s of his cheeks and jaws, and he will readily perceive a larger di&s;charge of &s;aliva to flow into his mouth from the&s;e compre&s;&s;ions, than is u&s;ual for the &s;ame glands, at any other time; which plainly demon&s;trates how much the action of the&s;e mu&s;cles contribute to influence the di&s;|charge of the&s;e &s;alival glands.</P>
<P>But if the relief given does not con&s;i&s;t in the virtues of the bread it&s;elf, but in the &s;ecretion of the recrement, called the Fa&s;ting Spittle, then you will &s;ay; to what end and purpo&s;e &s;erves a piece of bread, eat early in a morning fa&s;ting: To this I an&s;wer; to very great and good pur|po&s;es every way: For, in the fir&s;t place, there is no other &s;ub&s;tance we know of, that can &s;o properly be eat in a morning fa&s;ting, as a Cru&s;t of Bread, or that the &s;tomach will &s;o readily receive and dige&s;t as that concrete: Se|condly, of all other aliments, it is the mo&s;t proper vehicle to imbibe and collect the Fa&s;ting Saliva; and therefore, of all other vehicles, it is the fitte&s;t to be employed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, as it be&s;t mixes with the &s;aliva: Thirdly, the force from the teeth, nece&s;&s;ary to divide a Cru&s;t, and break its cohe&s;ions, will more readily &s;queeze out the &s;aliva from the &s;everal falival glands.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons I offer in preference to a Cru&s;t of Bread: and therefore I judge that no other concrete will &s;o readily &s;erve the purpo&s;e, as a Cru&s;t of Bread, unle&s;s it be what we call the captains bi&s;cuits, which they carry to &s;ea for their own eating: The&s;e are &s;till preferable to bread, as they are &s;till harder than a cru&s;t, and more de&s;titute of all foreign mixtures, as they are free both from leven and ye&s;t. But as the&s;e &s;ometimes may be difficult to be had, &s;o I judge a piece of bread, in general, the be&s;t vehicle we can &s;ub&s;titute, in order to convey the fa&s;ting &s;aliva into the &s;tomach. And hence it clearly appears, that the virtue and
<PB N="15" REF="14">efficacy that re&s;ults from eating a Cru&s;t of Bread, does not &s;o properly ari&s;e from the bread it&s;elf, as the chewing and mixing it with the Fa&s;ting Spittle; and therefore, to im|prove this fine liquid, volatile &s;oap, and exalt its virtues, I advi&s;e you, having eat nothing over night for &s;upper, about five of the clock in the morning, to eat one ounce, or an ounce and half, of either wheat or rye bread, which in chewing, will take up full half an ounce of the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, to reduce it into a proper, &s;oft, pulpo&s;e &s;ub&s;tance, and which, when well chewed and moi&s;tened, will be ea&s;ily &s;wallowed; and when you have got it down into the &s;tomach, then leave the re&s;t to nature, and, if you can, go to &s;leep. And it is advi&s;eable that you eat nothing for two or three hours after: Which leads me to &s;peak a few things of the con&s;equences of its being got into the &s;tomach, and of its mixture with divers of the &s;ecreted juices, in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Now this cour&s;e, if &s;teadily pur&s;ued for a month or &s;ix weeks, will prove of great efficacy in divers di&s;ea&s;es, that have ob&s;tructions and &s;abulous concretions for their parent, as the gravel, &s;tone, gout, and rheumati&s;m. Nor is it le&s;s efficacious in tumours of the liver, &s;pleen, and divers other organs; in all which ca&s;es, it is known to give great relief.</P>

<P>BUT after this &s;ine, thin, &s;aponaceous fluid, we call the &s;aliva or &s;pittle, has left the mouth, and before it gets down into the &s;tomach, it receives con&s;iderable improvements from a fine, thin, attenuated, volatile fluid, &s;ecreted from a number of glands, &s;ituated in the head of the gula, which &s;till renders it more penetrant and ab&s;ter|&s;ive: It &s;till acquires more force and energy from its mixture with the &s;tomach juices, di&s;charged from the various glands, who&s;e orifices form the velvet coat of this important organ: The&s;e &s;upply the &s;tomach with a &s;ine,
<PB N="16" REF="15">thin, clear, &s;pumo&s;e fluid, that ta&s;tes a little &s;aline and acid, but is very active and volatile in its properties.</P>
<P>This is ordained by nature to penetrate the foods, break their cohe&s;ions, and help forward their dige&s;tion for the nouri&s;hment of the body: And here a very fair opportunity offers it&s;elf for me to &s;peak of the principles of dige&s;tion, and to di&s;cover how the&s;e important changes are brought about; that convert our aliments into nouri&s;hment, but this would be foreign to my intention, and be a means of rendering the di&s;cour&s;e tedious, as my avow'd de&s;ign is brevity, and only to take a view of the &s;ecreted fluids, as far as, in their cour&s;e, they join with the Fa&s;ting Saliva, in order to exalt it into a fine, &s;aponaceous liquor, proper to relieve the body of its in&s;irmities.</P>
<P>Thus it appears how much the Fa&s;ting Saliva is improved in its nature, properties, and action, from the lubricating lymph of the gula, the &s;tomachic juices, and the chylous fluid, all continually dige&s;ting in the &s;tomach; continually &s;ecreting from their re&s;pective glands, and continually flowing over the pilorus into the duodenum, where they mix and unite with the bilio&s;e and pancreatic juices, which greatly improve this noble, active medicine, and by their tumults, con&s;&s;icts, and conqua&s;&s;ations, render it the mo&s;t penetrant, ab&s;ter&s;ive, and di&s;&s;olving medicine we know of in nature.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I have mentioned the bilio&s;e juice as an in|gredient in this fine, volatile, di&s;&s;olvent medicine, you will permit me here a little to examine into the nature, pro|perties, and &s;ecretion of the bile, becau&s;e it is a liquor, that will be found to have very con&s;iderable effect and con&s;equences in the various organs of the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>The liver is the organ ordained by nature for the &s;epa|ration, &s;ecretion, and ultimate perfection of the bilio&s;e hu|mour; and I &s;hould immediately proceed to examine the principles and mechani&s;m of this important organ, but that <HI>Malpigius,</HI> that accurate anatomi&s;t, and our learned coun|tryman Dr. <HI>Gli&s;&s;on,</HI> have &s;o fully exhau&s;ted this &s;ubject, that they have left but little, that is new, to be &s;aid by tho&s;e that come after them: And as I am only to ob&s;erve the nature of &s;ecretion, the principles of the bile, and the u&s;es and purpo&s;es for which it is ordained to &s;erve in life, &s;o I judge that the cour&s;e of the ve&s;&s;els, their various ramifications, and their aptne&s;s for the &s;ecretion of this
<PB N="17" REF="16">humour, will furni&s;h out every thing nece&s;&s;ary to be known upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>However, I think proper here to ob&s;erve, that the modus of &s;ecretion of the bile in the liver, is different from the humours &s;ecreted in all other parts of the body; for in all other parts the &s;ecretions are u&s;ually made from an artery, but in the liver nature has inverted that order, and makes u&s;e of a vein: and therefore the vena porta is appointed for this important office: this vein receives the blood from the &s;pleen, from the me&s;enterick arteries, and from almo&s;t all the organs &s;ituated in the lower belly: this &s;anguineous fluid moving much &s;lower in the vena porta, than it would have done in an artery of the &s;ame &s;tructure and mechani&s;m, is the &s;ole cau&s;e why the bilio&s;e &s;alts are &s;o readily di&s;po&s;ed to attract each other, and form a fluid with that vi&s;cidity, nece&s;&s;ary to give con&s;i&s;tence to the bile; and for this end and pur|po&s;e the vena porta and biliary ve&s;&s;els are inclo&s;ed in one common &s;heath or cap&s;ule: they enter the liver on the concave &s;ide, and are equally di&s;tributed through all its &s;ub&s;tance; &s;o that wherever there is a branch of the one, there, upon good in&s;pection, you will be &s;ure to di&s;cover a branch of the other: and therefore each lobe, and each gland of that lobe, whether on the convex or concave &s;ide, receives the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els, <HI>viz.</HI> A vein, nerve and artery, called <HI>arteria hepatica,</HI> to convey the nouri&s;hment for the u&s;e of the liver.</P>
<P>The porta receives the blood from the neighbouring parts, which is very &s;harp, by rea&s;on of the clo&s;e union of the bilious &s;alts; for the lymph that kept them a&s;un|der is &s;eparated from the blood by the glands of the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, ancreas, and me&s;entery: and there|fore, if this &s;harp, deter&s;ive, &s;aline bile, did continue to circulate with the blood, it mu&s;t frequently occa&s;ion vehement fevers, colliquative fluxes, heart-burnings, and &s;evere cholic pains, but the&s;e mi&s;erable effects are often prevented by a &s;oft olious fluid, that tempers the&s;e &s;harp, keen &s;alts, and blunts their acrimonious effects, both upon the inte&s;tines and parts adjoining.</P>
<P>In the &s;ecretion of the bile, we are to ob&s;erve, that the vena porta hepatica terminates in little &s;mall glan|dular folliculi, that &s;ecrete the bile from the blood; from the&s;e &s;mall glands the billous humour is received into the
<PB N="18" REF="17">extremeties of the pori biliarii, as they ino&s;culate with the extremeties of the vena porta, and which, by their unions, form one trunk, called the ductus hepaticus: this trunk empties part of the gall into the gall bladder: from the gall bladder ari&s;es the ductus cy&s;ticus, which uniting with the ductus hepaticus, form one common trunk, called the ductus communis cholidocus that con|veys the gall into the duodenum, near its curviture, that forms the beginning of the jejunum; &s;o that only part of the gall flows into the ve&s;ica felea, by the cy&s;tick duct, while the other part is conveyed into the inte&s;|tines by the ductus communis cholidocus, that opens into that organ by an oblique in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The bile &s;eems to be a gro&s;s, thick, vi&s;cid, oleous phlegm well impregnated with &s;alts of various kinds, as &s;weet, bitter, acerb, muriatic, and bitter &s;weet; all which are blended and intimately mixed in a &s;mall quantity of vi&s;cid phlegm: in this fluid, more than any other of the body, the oil and &s;alts greatly predominate; for an ounce of black gall contained in the fund of the ve&s;ica fellea yields oil and &s;alts, of each three drams; of phlegm only two drams.</P>
<P>If you examine the gall in the liver, in the pori biliarii, and gall bladder, you will find it of a different con&s;i&s;tence, colour and bitterne&s;s, in all the&s;e three different &s;ituations; for the gall in the liver, or glan|dular folliculi, is of a pale green, more fluid, &s;alti&s;h, and le&s;s bitter; that in the cy&s;tick duct more vi&s;cid, le&s;s bitter, but greatly partaking of &s;acharine &s;alts: that in the gall bladder appears of a deep poracious green: and la&s;tly, that in the fund, inclining to a blacki&s;h hue, and which is more vi&s;cid, le&s;s &s;alt, but contains more of the bitteri&s;h twang.</P>
<P>I could not but be thus particular upon the nature, principles, and &s;ecretion of the bile, becau&s;e our great ma&s;ter <HI>Hippocrates</HI> avers that the ingredients of bile are generated with the fir&s;t principles of life; and when it happens to be viteous, redundant, or defective, fails not to become the parent of mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es that any way can affect the con&s;titutions of animal bodies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are hot, fiery, and inflammatory: and tho' every con&s;titution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily generate bile, yet a ten&s;e, &s;pringy con&s;titution, or a con&s;titution with very
<PB N="19" REF="18">elactic fibres, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have this humour in the large&s;t proportion, and the&s;e liable to generate much bile, are very prone, &s;pring and fall, to fall into loo&s;e|ne&s;&s;es, fluxes, and the cholera morbus, which is what we call a bilious vomiting, accompanied with a loo&s;e|ne&s;s, where great quantities of yellow, green, black &s;tools are di&s;charged.</P>

<P>BUT I have not yet done with the bile: for it is a &s;ecreted humour, of that va&s;t &s;ervice and u&s;e in the animal-oeconomy, that I very much que&s;tion whe|ther either health could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or life it&s;elf be conti|nued without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for this bile, I am &s;peaking of is a &s;ecretion &s;o univer&s;al, that I do not know one &s;ingle &s;pecies of animals de&s;titute of this noble &s;ecretion; for man, bea&s;t, reptiles, and the various cla&s;&s;es of the fi&s;h kind, all have bile; and, in all the&s;e different &s;ub|jects, it is the bittere&s;t humour in the whole body; which is a &s;trong argument with me of the nece&s;&s;ity of bitter medicines in divers ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially when they are properly applied.</P>
<P>Now the bile is &s;o copious a &s;ubject, and affords &s;o many experiments to enlarge upon, that I could write a very large volume on the principles, nature, and vir|tues of the bile alone, without exhau&s;ting the &s;ubject: and we find by experience, that all people of a hot, choleric, dry con&s;titution, are inordinately &s;ubject to be hot, furious, and pa&s;&s;ionate, in proportion as they gene|rate a greater or le&s;&s;er quantity of bile: however, I will not &s;ay, that any one of the &s;ecreted liquors or recre|ments are the &s;ole cau&s;e of life and health; yet this I will aver, and am able to demon&s;trate, that neither health nor life can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, where the recrements of the &s;aliva and bile are for any con&s;iderable time ob|&s;tructed: and it is the ob&s;ervation of all naturali&s;ts, that the bile greatly differs in its own nature; for in the
<PB N="20" REF="19">larger animals it is le&s;s acid and &s;harp, than in tho&s;e that are little; in bea&s;ts than in birds, and in birds than in fi&s;hes, and in fi&s;hes, than the various tribes of in&s;ects: however, in man we di&s;cover the mo&s;t tinging bitter bile, that is in any animal what&s;oever; for it is &s;o in|ten&s;ely bitter in this animal, that one drop will com|municate a bitteri&s;h twang to two ounces of water; and the &s;ame quantity will tinge half a pint of the &s;ame fluid with a fine, beautiful, pali&s;h green.</P>
<P>But to be a little more explicit, and particular upon this &s;ubject: as it is a point of &s;uch importance to the health and lives of animals, I lay it down as a principle, not to be conte&s;ted, that life it&s;elf depends upon a regu|lar and uninterrupted circulation of the blood and fluids through the &s;everal organs of the animal-oeconomy: this con&s;tant and equal motion of the blood is kept up by the circulation of the bile, that every where de&s;troys the tenacious, thick, vi&s;cid particles of phlegm, that ren|ders the blood roapy, &s;tagnant, and apt to furr up the minute&s;t arteries.</P>
<P>This bilious humour, from its inciding, penetrant, and di&s;&s;olving qualities, not only a&s;&s;i&s;ts the circulation, but al&s;o is greatly concerned in promoting the &s;eparation of the chile from the faeces, or matter of our &s;tools, a&s;&s;i&s;ts its pa&s;&s;age into the lacteals, and then cuts, di|vides, and corrects the thick vi&s;cid &s;lime, that often adheres to the coats of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines: blocks up their &s;ecretions, and is a frequent cau&s;e of very &s;evere cholic pains.</P>
<P>But among&s;t all the &s;alts of the bile, which are both volatile and fixed, there is a peculiar e&s;&s;ential &s;alt, en|dued with a very &s;weet property; the&s;e e&s;&s;ential, &s;acha|rine &s;alts, more readily join with the chyle in the inte&s;|tines than any other; and this is that &s;alt, that gives to the chyle both its &s;weetne&s;s and ta&s;te, and that white|ne&s;s it obtains after it has pa&s;&s;ed the venae lacteae primi gene&s;is: this &s;acharine &s;alt al&s;o gives to the urine of tho&s;e that labour under the diabetes, that &s;weet ta&s;te we often di&s;cover in tho&s;e that, for any con&s;iderable time, have been &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If we proceed farther in our enquiries, we &s;hall di&s;|cover by experiments, that the bile of animals ab&s;terges like &s;oap, and renders oils mi&s;cible with water: as to
<PB N="21" REF="20">its virtues, it penetrates, attenuates and re&s;olves all ob|&s;tructions in every part of the body, and affects ro&s;ins, gums, and other tenacious bodies, by a di&s;&s;olution of their texture; whereby they are brought to mix with any fluid they are applied to: this bile or gall is neither alcalious or acid, but &s;eems a combination of various &s;alts, oils, and &s;ulphurs, diluted in a pretty large quan|tity of phlegm; and there is no que&s;tion to be made, but that the principal u&s;e of the bile is to &s;eperate at|tenuate, and &s;heath the a&s;perities of the chyle by its oils and &s;ulphurs; to blunt the acids by its oleous corpu&s;cles, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the circulation of the blood in the veins and arteries, by its &s;timulating powers: It al&s;o proves a &s;timulus to the inte&s;tines, and thereby facilitates the de&s;cent of our excrements, and without which we &s;hould be perpetually co&s;tive and &s;eldom go to &s;tool.</P>
<P>As the bile is the hotte&s;t and &s;harpe&s;t of all other hu|mours in the body; &s;o in its circulation, it every where irritates the fibres of the veins, nerves, and arteries; and thereby keeps up the circulation of the blood, and frees the glands from ob&s;tructions; &s;o that without the circulation of the bile, and con&s;tant &s;ecretion of this bilious humour, the circulation of the blood would be languid, the &s;ecretion of the &s;everal humours &s;tand &s;till, and life it&s;elf be extinct; for there is no other power, that we know of in nature, capable of keeping up the blood's motion, &s;ave the bile: and therefore, in the blood, the&s;e bilious &s;alts are &s;et at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, as only to irritate the veins and arteries to a degree, as may keep the blood in motion, and help forward the &s;ecretion of the &s;everal re&s;pective humours to their de&s;tined ends and purpo&s;es of life; but as the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are compo&s;ed of more &s;olid coats, &s;o, to make any &s;uitable impre&s;&s;ions upon their vi&s;cid, &s;limy &s;ecretions, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for a more active, volatile, inciding humour: and therefore, as the bile came to be &s;ecreted into the vena porta of the liver, it was deprived of its fluidity, that a greater quantity of its various &s;alts might be concentrated into a &s;maller portion of phlegm; for by this means its &s;alts are &s;o nearly collected, that they form a thick vi&s;cid, &s;aline, bitter humour, who&s;e office is to &s;timulate the inte&s;tines,
<PB N="22" REF="21">keep up their peri&s;taltic motions, and help forwards the de&s;cent of the excrements, and without which they would be apt to &s;tagnate in the inte&s;tines, and create ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s and &s;evere cholic pains; &s;o that the bilious &s;alts &s;erve &s;everal ends and purpo&s;es in life; for as they exi&s;t in the blood, &s;o they a&s;&s;i&s;t the circulation; as they are &s;ecreted in the liver, and flow into the in|te&s;tines, the more fine parts help forwards the &s;eparation of the chyle, and its &s;ecretion into the lacteals, while a gro&s;&s;er portion of the bilious &s;alts mix with the ex|crements, and facilitate their de&s;cent; and without which the animal it&s;elf neither could well &s;ub&s;i&s;t under a &s;ound &s;tate of health, or continue in life for any con|&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>After &s;o much &s;aid concerning our enquiries into the nature, principles, and &s;ecretion of the bile, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve on the fluid &s;ecreted from the pancreas, that it is a fine, thin, lymphatic liquor, who&s;e office, when mixed and incorporated with the &s;aliva, &s;tomachic juices, and bile, &s;erves to dilute and attenuate the chyle, and facilitate its motion into the lacteal ve&s;&s;els; which leads me to treat of the e&s;&s;icacy of the &s;aliva, when duly mixed, properly incorporated, and perfectly united with the foregoing liquors, whereby they arrive at the highe&s;t perfection their &s;everal natures are capable of; and of who&s;e effects and con&s;equences, in divers di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hall treat in the following &s;ection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECT. VII.</HI> Of the operation of the Fa&s;ting Saliva, when inwardly taken, and mixed with the pancreatic and bilious juices, in the &s;curvy, gravel, rheumati&s;m, and di|vers other di&s;ea&s;es incident to ob&s;truct the blood, and vitiate the &s;ecretions in the internal habit.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now &s;een in the fourth &s;ection what this fa&s;ting &s;pittle will do alone, and when outwardly applied in divers external di&s;ea&s;es: I come now to &s;peak of its effects and virtues, after it is mixed with divers &s;ecreted liquors, in its pa&s;&s;age from the mouth, till it becomes a &s;ecreted liquor into the mouth again. If the fa&s;ting &s;pittle, after the bread has been well
<PB N="23" REF="22">moi&s;tened with it in the mouth, is charged into the &s;tomach, it then, in its pa&s;&s;age, meets with the lubri|cating lymph of the gula, which, from its &s;pirituous, active qualities, very much improves the fa&s;ting &s;aliva: and after its de&s;cent into the &s;tomach, there the &s;to|machic juices are continually &s;ecreting from their re&s;pec|tive glands; continually mixing with the inge&s;ted &s;pittle conveyed into the &s;tomach with the meat we eat, till dige&s;ted into a thin, light, volatile &s;pume or froth, they, from their lightne&s;s and tenuity of parts, flow over the pylorus into the inte&s;tines, where all the&s;e various fluids of the &s;aliva, of the &s;ecreted liquor i&s;&s;uing from the glands of the oe&s;ophagus and &s;tomach, are united in the duodenum, and intimately combined with the bilious and pancreatic juices, di&s;charged from their re&s;pective pipes, into one uniform ma&s;s or &s;oap.</P>
<P>And having brought the fa&s;ting &s;aliva through a cour&s;e of dige&s;tions to mix with the bile, and pancreatic juice in the inte&s;tines; it appears to me, from the very nature and properties of the bilious humours thus new-modelled, from the acce&s;s of the various &s;ecretions, that we have generally confined the gall and pancreatic juices to an&s;wer very imperfect purpo&s;es of life; as if they were &s;ecreted for little el&s;e, but by their bitter and acid &s;alts, to di&s;&s;olve our aliments into the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, to facilitate the de&s;cent of the foeces, and give the depurated chyle a pa&s;&s;age into the lacteals. But upon a more attentive view of things, we &s;hall per|ceive that the bilious humour &s;erves very great and im|portant ends of life in the animal-oeconomy; for were this liquid, volatile, animal &s;oap, of a very active, clean&s;ing, penetrant and ab&s;ter&s;ive nature, by the large|ne&s;s and union of &s;alts of various natures, as of bitter, &s;weet, &s;alt, acrid, alcalious, and muriatic, all com|bined into one &s;ub&s;tantial fluid; it will nece&s;&s;arily hap|pen, that &s;uch a uniform liquor will be able to di&s;&s;olve all manner of vi&s;cous humours, and &s;abulous concre|tions, that furr up the mouths of the lacteals, ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of the chyle, and di&s;po&s;e all corrupt hu|mours to di&s;charge by &s;tool, urine, and in&s;en&s;ible per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>This fluid the &s;aliva, by the improvements it receives, as above de&s;cribed, being admitted with the chyle into
<PB N="24" REF="23">the lacteals, attenuates, di&s;&s;olves, and liqui&s;ies any furr or coaculum, that may &s;tick or adhere to the coats of the lacteals, or ob&s;truct in the ve&s;&s;els of the receptaculum chili, or ductus thoracicus: for the fine, thin, depu|rated chyle contains globles of a larger &s;ize, than any to be found in the blood it&s;elf: and therefore are apter to &s;tagnate in the&s;e fine, white tubes, called venae lacteae primi &amp; &s;ecundi generis, than in the ve&s;&s;els of any other parts of the body.</P>
<P>Therefore if it enters the lacteals, and gets into the blood, it purifies that fluid, di&s;&s;olves all preternatural lentours, &s;cours the glands, and clean&s;es their emuncto|ries, whereby the veins, nerves, and arteries, are cleared of all embarra&s;&s;ing ob&s;tructions, and the cour&s;e of nature carried on with the greate&s;t harmony and accord.</P>
<P>In the kidnies, ureters, and bladder, it is known to encrea&s;e the &s;eparation and &s;ecretion of the fluids in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o that a man may ob&s;erve him&s;elf to di&s;charge more urine after he has eat his cru&s;t in a morn|ing fa&s;ting, than at any other time of the day: again, this noble fluid, by its oleous and bal&s;amic qualities, abates pain, and a&s;&s;wages the inflammation of the parts, as is very u&s;ual where either much gravel or large &s;tones have frequently pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e &s;everal organs: as this fine, bal&s;amic, liquid, compound &s;oap is endued with &s;oft, oleous and bal&s;amic properties, whereby it may &s;heath the a&s;perities of the acrimonious &s;alts, and attemperate all &s;harp humours; &s;o it abounds al&s;o with &s;harp, acid, inciding &s;alts, both volatile, e&s;&s;ential, and fixed; where|by it attenuates, breaks, and di&s;&s;olves, all &s;abulous con|cretions, rectifies the intemperature of the blood, that may intercept the motion of the fluids in every part, and carries its virtues to the extreme&s;t organs of the body: nor does it only contribute to de&s;troy the mo&s;t &s;tubborn di&s;ea&s;es, but al&s;o mightily &s;erves to pre&s;erve the body in health; for where the circulation of the blood, the &s;ecretion of the juices, and di&s;charge of the excrementi|tious foeces and fluids are con&s;tant, regular, and uniform: there the health is in the highe&s;t perfection a man can po&s;&s;ibly arrive at, in this imperfect &s;tate of nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VIII.</HI> Of the force and efficacy of fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence, un|der the operation of this fine, penetrating, ab&s;ter&s;ive, animal &s;oap.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not pre&s;ume here to treat the&s;e &s;ubjects of &s;a&s;ting and ab&s;tinence as a divine, who intends, by his advice and coun&s;el, to mortify the body or &s;oul, and better the con&s;cience; but as a phy&s;ician, who is de&s;i|rous to pre&s;erve the &s;trength, health, and motions of the body of his patient, &s;teady, uniform, and regular.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, what great things have been promi&s;ed from quick&s;ilver, tar-water, Mrs. <HI>Stevens</HI>'s medicines, and divers other quack pills, powders, and elixirs, in the gravel, gout, drop&s;y, and various other di&s;ea&s;es: but I declare, that if the advice I offer for the benefit of mankind, be but carefully ob&s;erved, and punc|tually put in practice, that many will not only receive great relief, but an entire exemption, from the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and &s;tubborn di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>For we ought ever to con&s;ider, that nature is always on the &s;ide of health, and continually &s;triving to re&s;tore the con&s;titution, whenever borne down by the force of a di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that &s;eldom can any-ob&s;tructions happen to the body, but that repletion or gorging more than nature can dige&s;t, is the cau&s;e; and which, when often repeated, brings on indige&s;tions in the &s;tomach, windi|ne&s;s or flatulencies in the bowels and inte&s;tines; a cor|ruption of humours in the blood, and various ob&s;truc|tions in different organs of the habit: the&s;e are the parents of mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, that are incident to affect us in life; for what is the &s;curvy, but a thick, vi&s;cid, ropy blood, unable to pa&s;s the fine&s;t &s;trainers of the &s;everal organs; and how comes it by the&s;e properties, but by the indige&s;tions of our aliments? The &s;ame we may ob|&s;erve of cholic pains, the a&s;thma, and drop&s;y; their original cau&s;e undoubtedly ari&s;es from indige&s;tions; nor is the generation of gravel and &s;tone le&s;s owing to the &s;ame cau&s;es; for when our foods e&s;cape the force of the &s;tomach, not thoroughly dige&s;ted, they never after can receive the a&s;&s;imilating power from any after impre&s;|&s;ions the &s;ub&s;equent organs can lay upon them, but be|come
<PB N="26" REF="25">the cau&s;e of various ob&s;tructions in the &s;mall or|gans of the body: hence ari&s;e wind in the &s;tomach, pains in the inte&s;tines, rheumati&s;ms in the limbs, and &s;chirrous tumours in the liver, &s;pleen, and divers other parts.</P>
<P>Now, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, to bring nature home to her&s;elf, the fir&s;t thing mu&s;t be to pre&s;cribe ab|&s;tinence from all fle&s;h meats, for the compa&s;s of a week, if the di&s;ea&s;e be recent; three weeks, or a month, if the &s;ame has been of any long continuance: this will give nature time to recover her&s;elf; what I mean by nature recovering her&s;elf is that there are certain re&s;titutive powers in every organ and fibre of the body, whereby nature, when any organ is ob&s;tructed or oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;trives to recover its former tone. And this &s;elf-re&s;toring power is partly the effects of the fluids, and partly lodged in the organs them&s;elves, and the mechani&s;m that con&s;titutes their powers of force and motion.</P>
<P>Now in any great pre&s;&s;ure, from a load of foods charged into the &s;tomach, there is nothing that gives &s;o &s;ure a relief, as fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence; for the&s;e vacati|ons from aliments, enables the fibres of the &s;tomach, vicera, and other organs, to re&s;olve the ob&s;tructions, to break the cone&s;ions of the blood, and enables nature to root out the mo&s;t &s;tubborn di&s;ea&s;es, by flinging their cau&s;es off by either &s;tool, urine, or in&s;en&s;ible pre&s;pira|tion, or &s;ometimes a profu&s;e &s;weat: nor can there be a more noble, &s;afe, and efficacious remedy to rid us of either &s;tone, gravel, or gout, than what I now offer for the relief of mankind; that is ab&s;tinence, fa&s;ting, and a Cru&s;t of Bread eat early in a morning fa&s;ting; or rather the fa&s;ting &s;aliva charged into the &s;tomach, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a piece of bread: and in the&s;e ca&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we take nothing of aliments for two or three hours after.</P>
<P>Give me leave here to recapitulate, as briefly as I can, the virtues of one of the greate&s;t di&s;&s;olvent medicines in nature; and at the &s;ame time one of the &s;afe&s;t, that ever was communicated to mankind; a remedy that, if &s;teadily pur&s;ued, will cure both the gout, the gravel, the &s;tone, the a&s;thma, and drop&s;y. Would you know this invaluable &s;ecret,&mdash;It is ab&s;tinence.&mdash;I &s;ay ab|&s;tinence; the mo&s;t effectual cure in all di&s;ea&s;es: but by
<PB N="27" REF="26">the word ab&s;tinence, I do not mean a mere negative remedy, as if fa&s;ting was to do all the work, by &s;uffer|ing nature, at her lei&s;ure, to attenuate the fluids, re&s;olve the ob&s;tructions, and dige&s;t off the ob&s;tructing matter: nothing like it; for we have given you the form of this medicine above, told you the ingredients, and whereof this excellent remedy, &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ting to nature, is com|po&s;ed; and mu&s;t leave your&s;elf to judge of its efficacy and operation.</P>
<P>However to make &s;ome pertinent reflections upon this &s;ubject, I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that after the whole quantity of chyle is dige&s;ted into the &s;tomach, and conveyed into the inte&s;tines; thereupon the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, the lubricating lymph of the gula, the fluids &s;ecreted from the fine velvet coat of the &s;tomach, are all continu|ally &s;eparating from their re&s;pective glands; continually dige&s;ting in the &s;tomach, and continually flowing over the pylorus into the duodenum; there they are mixed, united, and intimately combined with the pancreatic and bilious juices, and which, by their conflicts, tumults, and conqua&s;ations, produce a mo&s;t fine, thin, attenuated fluid: this fluid being admitted into the lacteals, re|&s;olves the ob&s;tructions of the me&s;entery glands, every where &s;eated near the lacteals; attenuates, di&s;&s;olves, and liquifies any furr or coagulum, that may adhere, or &s;tick to the &s;ides of the lacteals, and prevent its entrance into the receptaculum chili, or ductus thoracicus. In a word, this fine, volatile, &s;aline fluid, from the various &s;ecretions mixing with it, becomes a univer&s;al di&s;&s;olvent; and is intended and &s;eparated by nature, to break the cohe&s;ions of the ob&s;truent matter, that may cleave to the coats of the ve&s;&s;els in every part of the body: and from this natural ob&s;ervation, we may learn the great benefit of frequent fa&s;ting, not only to pre&s;erve the body under a &s;ound &s;tate of health, but al&s;o how mightily &s;erviceable it is in relieving divers di&s;ea&s;es; and how efficacious it is in the gravel, &s;tone, rheumati&s;m, and divers other di&s;ea&s;es, that have ob&s;tructions for their parent.</P>
<P>You &s;ee now, that, after all, we di&s;cover this to be no imaginary medicine, formed upon the negative prin|ciples of fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence, as if they were to do all the work them&s;elves, but on the &s;olid grounds of

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IX.</HI> Of the air, diet, exerci&s;e, and other requi&s;itorial rules, nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, in order to facilitate the operation of this liquid &s;oap, I e&s;teem a mo&s;t invaluable remedy.</HEAD>
<P>THUS we have di&s;covered the operation of this noble and mo&s;t &s;overeign remedy in the &s;curvy, gravel, rheumati&s;m, and divers other di&s;ea&s;es; which leads me to &s;peak a few things of the air, diet and ex|erci&s;e, nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, in order to facilitate the relief it gives in the mo&s;t &s;tubborn di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But before we can expect to accompli&s;h all the&s;e fine effects, enumerated in the foregoing pages, I hold it highly nece&s;&s;ary that a proper air, a regular diet, and a well adju&s;ted exerci&s;e, &s;hould be enjoined the patient: as to the air, which is the fir&s;t thing we ought to con|&s;ult about, I judge it highly nece&s;&s;ary, that the patient &s;hould &s;ojourn in a &s;oft, free, open air, on a ground rather ri&s;ing; in a place free from woods, &s;ens, or high mountains, that may intercept the pure, bal&s;amic pro|perties of this healthful, enlivening fluid, the air. By all means, if he is &s;ubject to either the gravel, a&s;thma or rheumati&s;m, let him avoid living in great cities, which are pernicious to tho&s;e incident to the foregoing di&s;ea&s;es; and therefore my advice is, that he take the medicine in the country, if po&s;&s;ible, as the goodne&s;s of the air will a&s;&s;i&s;t its operation: but if his bu&s;ine&s;s calls him to the city, and he cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tay in the coun|try, he mu&s;t not, by any means intermit the medicine, but pur&s;ue its u&s;e a month or &s;ix weeks in the be&s;t man|ner
<PB N="29" REF="28">he can, without intermi&s;&s;ion; from which, in mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, that are lodged within the compa&s;s of the cir|culation, he will receive con&s;iderable benefit.</P>
<P>Having done with the air, the next thing to be ob|&s;erved, is the patient's diet: and I chu&s;e to begin with his diet in the morning, becau&s;e there are &s;everal nice circum&s;tances, nece&s;&s;ary to be adju&s;ted, in order to facilitate the operation of this &s;overeign remedy, we call the fa&s;ting &s;pittle. And therefore I advi&s;e the patient to eat his breakfa&s;t about ten of the clock in the morning: and, under a fit of the gravel, I would advi&s;e him to drink three or four di&s;hes of tea, made either of mallow flowers, or, if the &s;ea&s;on does not permit them to be had, let him u&s;e the mallow leaves, &s;weetened with honey, with a &s;lice or two of bread and butter, as the be&s;t breakfa&s;t he can have.</P>
<P>An hour or two after breakfa&s;t, let him exerci&s;e; and of all exerci&s;es, I prefer that on hor&s;eback; but if the weather happen to be hazy, and not promi&s;ing, he may then, for two or three hours, take the air in a chariot, clo&s;e chai&s;e, or coach. When I &s;peak of exerci&s;e, I always &s;uppo&s;e the patient is entirely free from any pains of the gravel or &s;tone.</P>
<P>After his return, if he finds him&s;elf refre&s;hed, he may take a walk in the garden, or about the hou&s;e, or bu&s;y him&s;elf for the remainder of the time between that and dinner, in his &s;tudy: but above all things, let him take care he does not habituate him&s;elf to drink wine, or any thing that is &s;trong, in the morning, before dinner; for many, by that means, have de&s;troyed their appetite, and for ever after &s;poiled a good dige&s;tion; &s;o that whatever they have eat at noon, has turned to wind and crudities, and &s;ubjected them to &s;evere cholic pains.</P>
<P>When he &s;its down to his great meal, or dinner, I permit him to eat of every thing, &s;o it be not too &s;alt; for &s;alts, of all kinds, are undoubtedly ingredients of both the gravel, &s;tone, and rheumati&s;m; and the&s;e in|gredients furni&s;h out the cau&s;e of frequent fits in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es: and therefore the young, of all animals, are to be cho&s;en, as they con&s;i&s;t of the lighte&s;t &s;alts, and &s;uch as are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipable by urine, &s;weat, and per&s;pi|ration; and &s;eldom concrete, as they are not endued
<PB N="30" REF="29">with that degree of attraction as are the &s;alts of older animals.</P>
<P>Between dinner and &s;upper, I would not advi&s;e him to touch any thing, unle&s;s a di&s;h or two of tea or coffee, with a &s;lice of bread and butter; for the great point is &s;o to order the air, diet, and exerci&s;e, as to be able to bring all the motions of the animal organs to a due tem|perature, and then we &s;hall greatly promote the opera|tion of this &s;alutary remedy, and render its virtues highly efficacious.</P>
<P>His &s;upper I would advi&s;e him to take about &s;ix or &s;even in the evening, and by no means later; and as milk is phlegmatic, &s;o, if he plea&s;es, he may take half a pint, or more, of white wine whey, with a &s;ea bi&s;cuit; or, if it plea&s;es him better, he may take a &s;lice of new chee&s;e, and drink a few gla&s;&s;es of old port, or a pint of fine, &s;oft ale, with about &s;ix ounces of the cru&s;t of a French role or minchet.</P>
<P>After the&s;e things are done, I advi&s;e him not to eat any thing till about &s;ix, &s;even, or eight of the clock the next morning, which is the time of his taking the grand medicine: this con&s;i&s;ts of half an ounce or &s;ix drachms of the fa&s;ting &s;aliva, pre&s;&s;ed or &s;quee&s;ed out from the &s;alival glands into the mouth, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the jaws and teeth, in eating an ounce or ten drachms of the cru&s;t or heel of a loaf made of the pure&s;t wheat; for the cru&s;t occa&s;ions &s;o much the greater pre&s;&s;ure from the teeth, who&s;e greater force occa&s;ions a greater di&s;|charge of this &s;alival fluid, and which will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es we declared in the preceding &s;ections.</P>
<P>And, though of late years, we have heard of mighty feats done by crude mercury, tar water, and other quack medicines, &s;old up and down the town, &s;upport|ed by royal patents, and dignified titles: yet I que&s;tion, whether in the gravel, &s;tone, and rheumati&s;m, there ever yet was di&s;covered, or at this time is di&s;covered, or any remedy, in future times, &s;hall be di&s;covered, that in its virtues and efficacy, comes up to this invaluable medicine, I now offer for the benefit of mankind: and the patient may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that if the&s;e rules and cautions and &s;ome others, that does not properly come within the narrow compa&s;s, I here have &s;et my&s;elf, are
<PB N="31" REF="30">but rightly pur&s;ued, they will not only mightily contri|bute to pre&s;erve him in health, but al&s;o be extremely efficacious, to re&s;tore this invaluable ble&s;&s;ing, whenever overpowered by the force of a di&s;ea&s;e: and in all the&s;e the patient will find little occa&s;ion for taking of medi|cines, provided he is ob&s;erving of the&s;e rules, and care|ful, every day, to adju&s;t his air, diet, and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, though I will not pretend, like our modern quacks, to cry up this medicine, as a univer&s;al catholicon, and promi&s;e the world, that it will never fail to cure all di&s;ea&s;es it is applied to; yet I will boldly venture to declare a &s;olemn truth, that no quack can, with ju&s;tice, affirm in favour of his medicine: that it never was known to do any harm to man, woman, or child, notwith|&s;tanding the many thou&s;ands of people, that have ex|perimentally made u&s;e of it.</P>
