<PB REF="4">
<P>A di&s;tingui&s;hing feature of the pre&s;ent times, in a medical point of view, is the prevalence of nervous di&s;orders, and a great increa&s;e of paralytic affections. Their origin is not difficult to be a&s;certained. A deter|mination appears to pervade all ranks, to call forth into immediate action all the re|&s;ources of exi&s;tence, by an employment of the mo&s;t powerful agents; and, in the gra|tification of a moment, to ri&s;que their whole &s;tock of nervous energy. To &s;uch inordinate movements, kept up by a repeated u&s;e of the mo&s;t active &s;timulants, may we ju&s;tly look for the cau&s;e of that derangement, which phy&s;icians have to encounter under the multiplied forms of nervous debility.
<PB N="2" REF="5">Various chemical, pncumatic, and mecha|nical operations, it is well known, are con|&s;tantly going forward in the human body: and when any of the&s;e is too much accele|rated, or precipitately urged, the machine it&s;elf is de&s;troyed, or is rendered u&s;ele&s;s. Strongly incited to animal gratifications, men become in&s;en&s;ible to the condition of their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, which, &s;o far from implying an ince&s;&s;ant &s;eries of plea&s;ures, in many ca&s;es &s;eems to produce the highe&s;t en|joyments by preceding pain; thus inculcating upon human creatures the nece&s;&s;ity of tem|perance, and, in many in&s;tances, the utility of &s;elf-denial. However, as was &s;aid, but fewattend to the admonitions of their animal con&s;titution. They aim at acquiring what Nature, more provident than they, has pro|hibited to be attained; and by a lavi&s;h u&s;e of wine, &s;pirits, or laudanum, endeavour to procure to them&s;elves the power of perpe|tual enjoyment. They bid defiance to the
<PB N="3" REF="6">warnings of experience in the fate of others: and &s;olicitous only to appear replete with &s;pirit and animation in the eyes of tho&s;e with whom they a&s;&s;ociate, (who probably have recour&s;e to the &s;ame incitements) they continue to urge on the proce&s;&s;es of life, till &s;ome part of the apparatus gives way, and they &s;uddenly feel all the &s;ymptoms of a ru|ined con&s;titution, not to be repaired by the utmo&s;t efforts of medical &s;kill. Hence pro|ceed that train of nervous &s;ymptoms, which no le&s;s impede the operations of the mind, than occa&s;ion painful bodily &s;en&s;ations: &s;en|&s;ations &s;o acute, as to drive the unhappy victims into the hands of daring empirics, to who&s;e pretended &s;kill they too often &s;a|crifice tho&s;e lives and fortunes, which ought to have been devoted to the good of their connections.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of my &s;ubject, I &s;hall endeavour carefully to avoid every thing
<PB N="4" REF="7">that has the appearance of ab&s;tract &s;pe|culation. I wi&s;h only to announce what, I conceive, will prove a benefit to the public, in alleviating &s;ome of the mo&s;t di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;orders, that are incident to the human frame. I will &s;imply relate what has taken place under my own ob&s;ervation. I will not attempt to account for the <HI>modus operandi</HI> of the plant, which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay; nor take upon me to decide whether it acts by renewing the ir|ritability of the &s;y&s;tem, or only by giving energy to the natural powers: nor &s;hall I pre&s;ume to determine whether the nerves, acting as conductors of electricity, are, by its means, made capable of tran&s;mitting a larger quantity of this &s;ubtile fluid through the whole frame, as Aurum Mu&s;ivum, when applied to the rubber of an electrical appa|ratus, enables the cylinder to accumulate a much larger quantity of that agent&mdash;It is
<PB N="5" REF="8">my intention only, by the relation of facts, to e&s;tabli&s;h the u&s;e of this powerful drug in tho&s;e di&s;orders, which u&s;ually attend upon an enervated con&s;titution. As the plant is not to be found in our Materia Medica at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, de&s;cribe it, give it's hi&s;tory, and relate the ca&s;es in which I have &s;ucce&s;sfully employed it; in hopes that the faculty will be induced to make a fair trial of it, and, if found worthy of further notice, that they will furni&s;h the world with the re&s;ult of their ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t acquaintance with the &s;ubject of this e&s;&s;ay began while I was examining, about four years ago, the plants in the Nur&s;ery Grounds at Cottingham. I was told by the proprietor, of the wonderful effect of the Poi&s;on Oak; that, if touched by the fingers, and not immediately wa&s;hed off, the acrimony it imparts would be
<PB N="6" REF="9">retained for a long time; that &s;hould a per&s;on accidentally touch his eyelids, or any part of the body where the &s;kin u&s;ually corrugates, whil&s;t the virulence of the deleterious particles thus contracted conti|nues unimpaired, a &s;welling and trouble|&s;ome itching would come on, and continue for &s;ome time; and that even &s;ome of his men had &s;uffered &s;o much as to lo&s;e &s;uch parts of the &s;kin by &s;phacelation, as the acrid juice had touched. This deter|mined me to make further enquiries into it's powers; and I &s;oon after &s;aw in the Analytical Review (to the conductors of which I beg leave to make my acknow|ledgements) &s;ome account of experiments made in France, with the <HI>Rhus Radicans,</HI> to which this plant is clo&s;ely allied, by Mon&s;. Fre&s;noi; from which it appeared, that he had given the di&s;tilled water and extract of this plant, in ca&s;es of paraly&s;is of the lower extremities, with &s;ucce&s;s.
<PB N="7" REF="10">This information induced me to hope, that the Sumach I now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, might be ex|hibited with equal advantage, in the &s;ame and &s;imilar complaints: and though, in the form of di&s;tilled water and infu&s;ion I was not &s;ucce&s;sful, yet the event of the ca&s;es &s;ubjoined, in which I have given it in &s;ub|&s;tance, has made me ample amends. I mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s, that it's u&s;e has not been uniformly attended with complete &s;ucce&s;s. Having always advi&s;ed extreme caution in it's fir&s;t exhibition, it has required a greater length of time to produce the de&s;ired effects, than the general impatience, which, I apprehend, all medical men have to com|bat with in their practice, will allow; an impatience continually encrea&s;ed by the bold adverti&s;ers of &s;pecifics for the cure of every di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have not found that an attempt has at any time been made in this country, to a&s;certain, by experiments, the power of the
<PB N="8" REF="11"><HI>Toxicodendron,</HI> as a medicine. In France it &s;eems to have been made the &s;ubject of enquiry for &s;ome time; for Mon&s;ieur Fontana, &s;peaks of the many celebrated writers,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Que les Ecrivains les plus celebres ont commun&eacute;ment regard&eacute; comme un poi&s;on tres pui&s;&s;ant, quoique quelques Phy&s;iciens modernes ne l'aient pas trouv&eacute; tel pour certains Ammaux." <HI>Fontana.</HI></NOTE> who have con&s;idered it as a mo&s;t virulent poi&s;on. The experiments how|ever, which he made upon animals, and has related, are not nece&s;&s;ary to be intro|duced here, &s;ince I hold all experiments on animals as in&s;ignificant, and irrelevant to the effects of any medicine on the human &s;ubject. And tho&s;e made on him&s;elf go to &s;hew merely the manner in which it affected the &s;kin, and &s;eem to have terrified<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Mais jai &eacute;t&eacute; forc&eacute; d'abandonner, des le com|mencement mes recherches fur cette plante, parceque j'ai eu le malheur de m' en poi&s;onner moimeme par trois fois de &s;uite, avee &s;es feuilles." <HI>Fontana.</HI></NOTE> him from any internal exhibition.</P>

<P>THE Pube&s;cent Poi&s;on-Oak or Sumach, is a deciduous &s;hrub of moderate growth, ri&s;ing to the height of about four feet, it is covered with a greyi&s;h coloured &s;ome|what &s;triated bark, which is u&s;ually marked with minute &s;pots, or glandular appear|ances, not greatly unlike the effect of an in&s;ect, they have al&s;o a di&s;tant re&s;emblance to &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t &s;pecies of <HI>Sphoeria,</HI> for like <HI>Sphoerioe</HI> they &s;eem to ari&s;e from the wood, and finally cau&s;e a &s;ort of bur&s;t|ing or opening of the bark, immediately over them equal to their own &s;ize, they further re&s;emble <HI>Sphoerioe</HI> in being large&s;t on the older and more &s;tunted &s;hoots, par|ticularly in the winter &s;ea&s;on; but in all likelihood they are the common excretory ducts of the plant, who&s;e fluid being exce&s;&s;ively acrid, may po&s;&s;ibly require more
<PB N="13" REF="16">capacious outlets, than &s;hrubs of a milder juice.</P>
<P>The lower &s;hoots, on and near the ground, in moi&s;t &s;hady &s;ituations, which the plant mo&s;t affects, trail con&s;iderably like the <HI>Rhus radicans Linnoei,</HI> (&s;mooth rooting Poi&s;on-Oak or Sumach) and have like that &s;hrub, the property of &s;ending down radicles into the earth, by which the plant admits of great increa&s;e, in any of the winter months.</P>
<P>In &s;uch &s;ituations, however, I have not &s;een it produce &s;eeds &s;o readily, as in drier and more pinching places, where it loo&s;es in a great degree, it's radicating principle, grows more &s;tiff and robu&s;t, and pro|duces annual crops of pale yellow &s;triated berries.</P>
<P>There is a remarkable in&s;tance of this kind, (the &s;ingularity of which induces me
<PB N="14" REF="17">to mention it) now exi&s;ting in a <HI>wall,</HI> in the Phy&s;ic Garden of the Company of Apothecaries at Chel&s;ea, out of a chink in the &s;ide of which, and near the ground, grows a &s;trong plant of this <HI>Rhus,</HI> that has pro&s;pered there ever &s;ince the time of the celebrated Miller, and which Mr. Fairbairn, the Company's pre&s;ent gardener, obligingly a&s;&s;ured me, was what Miller called the &s;econd &s;pecies of <HI>Toxicodendron,</HI> in his Gardener's Dictionary; it is, in all probability, the identical plant from which the de&s;cription in that well known work was made; it &s;eeds annually, but none of it's lower &s;hoots exhibit the lea&s;t radicating propen&s;ity, although other plants of the &s;ame kind, in the &s;hady parts of the &s;ame garden, have that quality in great perfec|tion, but I believe they rarely produce &s;eeds; &s;o much do local circum&s;tances affect and alter the mo&s;t permanent and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing characters of vegetables.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<P>I believe it is pretty generally known to Gardeners, and others concerned in the plea&s;ant and in&s;tructive employment of horticulture, that many other fibrous plants, which, like the <HI>Rhus Toxicoden|dron,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of encrea&s;ing ing them&s;elves in any con&s;iderable degree by their roots, have that property material|ly le&s;&s;ened, when the place they grow in happens to be dry and poor, for nature has chiefly allotted them rich and moi&s;t habitations, and, with her u&s;ual care, con&s;tructed their con&s;titutions accordingly; the alteration &s;uch plants undergo, in &s;uch a &s;oil, is doubtle&s;s in the direction of their juices, which (being fewer) appear to pa&s;s by the lower and le&s;s noble parts, (they had before rendered luxuriantly radicant or prolific) and mount upwards by a natural and almo&s;t in&s;tinctive impul&s;e, to feed and mature, with collected force, the infant germs which they had before too &s;paringly &s;upplied with nouri&s;hment.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<P>Thus Nature checked by art or accident, in any cu&s;tomary channel of renewing her works, kindly &s;earches out and perfects another, that &s;he may not be di&s;appointed in the multiplication of her productions, for
<Q><L>"&mdash; each mo&s;s,</L>

<L>Which Nature's &s;elf wou'd rue."</L></Q></P>
<P>I am not acquainted with any common plant, that more abundantly exemplifies the above doctrine, than the Lilly of the Valley, <HI>Convallaria majalis Lin.</HI> which is well known to all who po&s;&s;e&s;s a garden, to flower freely, and increa&s;e amazingly by the root, in a moi&s;t north border, yet few, I fancy, have &s;een it produce perfect &s;eeds in that &s;ituation, notwith&s;tanding the vigour of it's growth; but when it is planted and confined in a garden pot, and it's increa&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="20">by the root con&s;equently checked, it will frequently produce good &s;eeds.</P>
<P><HI>Vinca major et minor,</HI> greater and le&s;&s;er Periwinkle, <HI>Tu&s;&s;ilago Peta&s;ites,</HI> Butter Burr, and many other plants, as remarkable for the &s;terility of their &s;eeds, as their great increa&s;e by roots, might, in all probability, experience a &s;imilar effect, if under &s;imilar circum&s;tances; their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;terility therefore, &s;hould &s;eem to re&s;ult chiefly from the peculiarity of their &s;ituation and con&s;titutions, and not from any real defect in the formation of all, or any of their parts of fructification, as has &s;ometimes been ingeniou&s;ly conjectured by botani&s;ts and others; but, to return to the <HI>Rhus Toxicodendron,</HI></P>
<P>The leaves are alternate and three'd, and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd upon remarkable long petioles, the lateral leafits are u&s;ually &s;upported on very
<PB N="18" REF="21">&s;hort petioles, which frequently loo&s;e them|&s;elves by a kind of dilatation, in the &s;ub|&s;tance of the leafits; the terminal leafit has often a foot&s;talk half an inch long or up|wards: all the leafits are dull green, have a drooping po&s;ture, and an unplea&s;ant a&s;pect, they are oval-angulate and nervo&s;e, with a kind of undulated margin, which &s;ometimes forms di&s;tant tooth-like crena|tures. The young wood-buds, petioles, and the nerves on the under&s;ides of the leafits, are furni&s;hed with a very vi&s;ible degree of pube&s;cence, on which account I have ventured to give the plant the Engli&s;h name of Pube&s;cent Poi&s;on Oak, or Sumach, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hing it from the <HI>Rhus radicans Lin.</HI> which has con&s;tantly &s;mooth leaves and &s;hoots.</P>
<P>The flowers are produced in June, July, and Augu&s;t, on &s;hort, crowded axilleay racemi, which are paniculate, and in a &s;tate
<PB N="19" REF="22">of nature, dioecious. In our &s;pecimens, however, (which were cultivated luxuri|ant ones, and the only ones which we could procure in a &s;tate of fructification) a few of the flowers were hermaphrodite, and had an encrea&s;ed number of parts, particularly, a minute &s;ix cleft calyx, &s;ix &s;mall lance-oval whiti&s;h, rather &s;triated, petals; and &s;ix &s;hort &s;tamina, &s;upporting as many antherae.</P>
<P>When not rendered unnaturally luxuriant by cultivation, the male flower con&s;i&s;ts of a minute calyx with five &s;hallow clefts, a corolla of five &s;mall petals, and five &s;tamina which &s;upport as many antherae, and the germen in the female flower is roundi&s;h, and when a little magnified, appears &s;ome|what bottle-&s;haped, and &s;upports a &s;hort &s;tylus, which is crowned with three very &s;mall &s;tigmata.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="23">
<P>The fruit or &s;eed arrives at maturity in England about the month of October and November, it is a round, dry, pale-yel|low &s;triated berry, which is &s;omewhat &s;cario&s;e, and nearly the &s;ize of a &s;mall pea, and enclo&s;es one hard compre&s;&s;ed end-nick|ed kernel, which has a thick furrowed mealy covering.</P>
<P>The germination of the &s;eed, I am &s;orry to add, I have had no opportunity of ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rhus Toxicodendron</HI> is a native of North America, it has been introduced into England ever &s;ince the year 1640, and was cultivated in this country as a curious &s;hrub in the time of Parkin&s;on, who figures it in his Theatre.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Parkin&s;on</HI>'s Theatrum Botanicum and <HI>Aiton's</HI> Hortus Keween&s;is.</NOTE></P>

<P>A &s;hort account of ca&s;es in which it has been employed, will enable the reader to judge of it's power as a medicine.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e is in&s;erted as drawn up by my ingenious friend Mr. B&mdash;, an eminent &s;urgeon in this neighbourhood, who paid the greate&s;t attention to the exhibition of the medicine, and has related, in a clear and intere&s;ting manner, the gradual recovery of his own wife.</P>

<HEAD>CASE I.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. B&mdash;, aged 38, always enjoyed remarkable good health, till about eight years ago, at which time &s;he complained of a di&s;order in her bowels, which &s;he de|&s;cribed to feel as if the bowels had lo&s;t their &s;en&s;ation, and that a cold wind &s;eemed to ri&s;e up the oe&s;ophagus. As &s;he was co&s;tive, two ounces of the Ol. Ricini were given at four do&s;es, which having no effect, &s;tronger purgatives were admini|&s;tered, but without producing a &s;tool; after
<PB N="23" REF="26">which the &s;moke of tobacco was thrown up, the warm bath applied, a do&s;e of calo|mel given, and a bli&s;ter put upon the belly. At length an evacuation was obtained; and from the large quantity of cathartic reme|dies u&s;ed, the bowels now took on the other extreme, and a violent purging en&s;ued.&mdash; She now complained of a pricking pain on the right &s;ide of the abdomen, which went off upon her voiding by &s;tool a piece of a large plumb &s;tone, one &s;ide of which was worn as &s;harp as the edge of a knife. After this &s;he was frequently troubled with ob|&s;tinate con&s;tipations of the bowels, and obliged to have recour&s;e to purgative me|dicines. In the year 1789, &s;he had two fits, which, I believe, were epileptic; but, as I happened not to &s;ee her in either of them, I cannot be certain. In the month of September, &s;he was &s;eized with pains in her hands and feet, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be gouty; and when the&s;e went off, &s;he
<PB N="24" REF="27">lo&s;t entirely the u&s;e of the exten&s;or mu&s;cles of the wri&s;ts, and &s;oon after tho&s;e of the feet, which was followed by the lo&s;s of the exten&s;ors of the fingers and toes. A tumour now aro&s;e upon the metacarpal bones of each hand, which &s;eemed a &s;welling either of the pcrio&s;teum or bone it&s;elf, and had greatly the appearance of a &s;crophulous affection, The tumours &s;eemed &s;ometimes likely to &s;uppurate, but about the end of the year 1790, they gradually di&s;appeared. The hands now looked livid, and the exten|&s;or mu&s;cles upon the arms and hands wa&s;ted and &s;hrivelled; her feet felt like logs of wood, and the fingers and toes were con|tracted from the action of the flexor mu&s;|cles; &s;he could not walk without help, and when &s;he attempted it, always com|plained of &s;omething drawing her back|wards. During this time, &s;he took a variety of volatile, cardiac, and tonic medicines, but without any good effect. In the month
<PB N="25" REF="28">of September, 1791, Dr. ALDERSON was con&s;ulted, and advi&s;ed her to take the TOXICODENDRON. Six grains of the pow|dered leaves of that plant were infu&s;ed in eight ounces of boiling water, a table &s;poon|ful to be given three times a day. The whole of this was taken without any &s;en&s;i|ble effect, except a &s;light pricking &s;en&s;a|tion in the feet and hands:</P>
<P>Oct. 3d, She took one fourth of a grain of the powdered leaves made into a bolus with Con&s;. Cort. Aurant. twice a day.</P>
<P>4th, The &s;ame; the pricking &s;en&s;a|tion continues, and the arms, to the ends of the fingers, feel as if warm water was running-down them.</P>
<P>5th, Medicines continued three times a day.</P>
<P>6th, The &s;ame. In the evening, had an
<PB N="26" REF="29">irregular &s;pa&s;modic fluttering in the toes.</P>
<P>Oct. 7th, Medicines continued. Was agree|ably &s;urpri&s;ed to find &s;he could extend her fingers and toes a little. Her hands a little &s;wel|led, and her feet and ancles much more &s;o. She has, in a great mea&s;ure, recovered the u&s;e of the exten&s;or pollicis of the right hand, and that of the left in a &s;maller degree; has al&s;o lo&s;t the dead hard &s;en&s;ation in her finger ends, which was al|ways her con&s;tant attendant.</P>
<P>8th, Medicines continued.</P>
<P>9th, One third of a grain ter die.</P>
<P>10th, The &s;ame. Walked up &s;tairs with|out help, her hands al&s;o &s;tronger and better, but the exten&s;ors of the wri&s;ts &s;till inactive.</P>
<P>11th, The &s;ame.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="30">
<P>Oct. 12th, Took half a grain ter die. Begins to walk tolerably well, and can u&s;e her hands better, the ex|ten&s;or, adductor, and abductor mu&s;cles of the thumbs, having recovered their action.</P>
<P>15th, Three grains were made into four bolu&s;es, and one taken three times a day. At night the &s;en|&s;ation, as if hot water was run|ning down the arms, very trou|ble&s;ome, with the pricking feel in the fingers.</P>
<P>17th, One grain ter die.</P>
<P>30th, Takes one grain and a half ter die; and this day perceived that &s;he had recovered the u&s;e of the exten&s;or mu&s;cles of the wri&s;ts.</P>
<P>She continued the medicine, gradually in|crea&s;ing the do&s;e to four grains ter die, for &s;ome time longer. It &s;eemed to act as a
<PB N="28" REF="31">gentle aperient, and frequently, when the large do&s;es were taken, occa&s;ioned a &s;light vertigo, with a pain acro&s;s the forehead, and a nau&s;ea for about half an hour after taking it. She has now left off the medicine twelve months, has entirely recovered the u&s;e of her hands, and walks a mile or two very well; but the mu&s;cles of the feet are not &s;o well recovered as tho&s;e of the hands, and &s;he always lifts the feet very high when &s;he walks; which may be owing to a re|membrance that in her former &s;tate, if &s;he attempted walking, and met with the &s;malle&s;t ob&s;tacle, a fall on the face was generally the con&s;equence.</P>

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>GREG, mariner, complained of the lo&s;s of one &s;ide, which he attributed to falling a&s;leep upon the deck, after being exhau&s;ted
<PB N="29" REF="32">by fatigue during a gale of wind. I ordered him half a grain of the powdered leaves of the TOXICODENDRON, three times a day. On the &s;econd day, he felt an unu&s;ual twitching, or convul&s;ive motion, in the arm and leg affected; and when I &s;aw him on the Monday following, he could, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, bring the di&s;ea&s;ed leg acro&s;s the other, and had much more u&s;e of his arm. He continued his medicine a week longer, when, finding him&s;elf &s;o far recovered, that he could be employed as a pilot on the river, he was content not to compleat his cure, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;ubject him to be impre&s;&s;ed. He has continued in much the &s;ame &s;tate for &s;ome time pa&s;t, having gotten more u&s;e of his limbs than he ever expected. It is but right to ob&s;erve, that during two years previous to his application to me, every other means had, in vain, been employed, to re&s;tore the action of his leg and arm.</P>

<P>Mr. B&mdash;, &s;urgeen, aged 47, after having endured a complication of ills, haemoptysis, jaundice, me&s;enterie ob&s;truction, and gene|ral atrophy, lo&s;t the total u&s;e of all his limbs; and even his mental faculties under|went a &s;imilar paraly&s;is. All his powers of ratiocination were &s;u&s;pended, and he was reduced to a &s;tate nearly as helple&s;s as that of a child only &s;ix months <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d. In this &s;ituation I gave him the TOXICODENDRON, half a grain three times a day, which, in the cour&s;e of a week, improved his appetite, and removed the habitual co&s;tivene&s;s to which he had long been liable. The do&s;e was gradually increa&s;ed to one grain, three times a day. It produced &s;ome twitching acro&s;s the abdomen, with irregular or convul&s;ive motion in the limbs; and when the nervous influence &s;eemed to pa&s;s to the extremities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> excited in the brain &s;uch a &s;en&s;ation of pain, as made him frequently
<PB N="31" REF="34">exclaim mo&s;t violently: but when any one a&s;ked him where his pain was, he an&s;wered, he could not mention any particular place, but that all his limbs were, as if &s;tretched forcibly. This was more e&s;pecially the ca&s;e after &s;leep.</P>
<P>The do&s;e was gradually increa&s;ed to three grains four times a day, and he has now taken it for three months. His brain has recovered its wonted functions; his &s;tomach and bowels do their office more completely than for years; he re&s;ts without opium, though for a long time in the con&s;tant habit of taking it; his animal &s;pirits are wonderfully invigorated; and although he has not yet acquired the perfect u&s;e of his limbs, they &s;eem to be recovering their tone, and I have every rea&s;on to hope, that he will, in time, be re&s;tored to the full enjoyment of life.</P>

<P>GEORGE. FORD, &s;hip carpenter, aged 24, of a &s;trong athletic make, and full habit of body, was admitted into the Hull General Infirmary, on Wedne&s;day the 13th of November, 1793, for a paralytic affection, which had deprived him of the u&s;e of his right &s;ide; his recollection was &s;o impaired, that he could not give any account of the attack him&s;elf, but his wife informed me, that, for a week before he lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs, he had, at times, complained of a dull pain in his head, and numbne&s;s in his right hand and foot; that, by the advice of &s;ome old woman, he had been blooded on the Monday, and that upon going out of doors &s;oon afterwards, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with hemiplegia. In which &s;tate he was admitted into the Infirmary, on the Wedne&s;day following.</P>
<P>A vomit was given him &s;oon after his admi&s;&s;ion, which was followed the next day
<PB N="33" REF="36">by a warm purgative, and volatile and &s;ti|mulant medicines for the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t week; but finding that I was not likely to gain any ground from the u&s;ual plan, and being de&s;irous of trying the power of the TOXICODENDRON in a recent ca&s;e, I order|ed him half a grain of the powdered leaves of this plant in pills, three times a day; on the &s;econd day, after the exhibition of this medicine, he felt a &s;udden convul&s;ive twitching, or involuntary motion in certain mu&s;cles of the affected &s;ide; from that moment he found he had the &s;ame motion at will; every &s;ucceeding day he felt &s;ome mu&s;cle or other convul&s;ively moved, and it was always remarked, by the other patients in the &s;ame ward, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of voluntarily employing all tho&s;e mu&s;cles that had been once convul&s;ively affected in con&s;equence of the TOXICODEN|DRON.
