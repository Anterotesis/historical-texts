<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with much diffidence that I offi|cially pre&s;ume to deliver a few de|tach'd thoughts, chiefly re&s;pecting MEDI|CAL IMPROVEMENT; as an addre&s;s in|troductory to the commencement of our literary bu&s;ine&s;s in this place. Your in|dulgent candour which I have &s;o often experienced, I flatter my&s;elf, will, on this occa&s;ion, impute the faults which you will doubtle&s;s di&s;cover, not to intention, but inability or mi&s;conception.</P>
<P>I chearfully embrace this opportunity to expre&s;s the mo&s;t grateful impre&s;&s;ions I
<PB N="8" REF="5">entertain of the great and un&s;ollicited honour you have been plea&s;ed to confer upon me, by twice calling me to the of|fice of PRESIDENT. Had my powers been equal to my wi&s;hes, no part of my con|duct in that elevated character, had been unworthy of you, or of this chair. Al|tho' indi&s;pen&s;ible avocation permits me no longer to hold any office among you; yet will I lo&s;e no opportunity of being pre&s;ent, and, as far as I may be able, of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in your in&s;tructive &s;peculations; and of promoting to the utmo&s;t of my power, the general pro&s;perity of a Society to which I ever have been &s;o much at|tached.</P>
<P>In the commercial world, it is allowed by all, that the comparative rate of ex|change, is a ju&s;t <HI>index</HI> of the pro&s;perous or adver&s;e &s;tate of trade in different countries individually, or relatively con|&s;idered.
<PB N="9" REF="6">With no le&s;s truth, in my opnion, the comparative degree of cultivation to which <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> and philo&s;ophy, or the fine and u&s;eful arts, arrive in different kingdoms may be re|garded as demon&s;trative of their re|lative civilization.</P>
<P>Judging by this criterion, altho' in this re&s;pect CALEDONIA may not ju&s;tly boa&s;t of being the fir&s;t, &s;he is by no means the la&s;t of the European nations: Her progre&s;s in the walk of general &s;cience and liberality is rapid, and I hope will long continue &s;o. Ju&s;tice, however, con&s;trains me to confe&s;s, that long, too long, in a great degree, &s;he had neglected the MEDICAL PHILOSOPHY. In an <HI>Aera</HI> not beyond the recollection of &s;ome pre&s;ent, the immortal honour of planting a medical &s;chool in this <HI>Metropo|lis;</HI> now indeed &s;econd in fame and erudition to none in Europe, was re&s;erv|ed
<PB N="10" REF="7">to a di&s;tingui&s;hed, a fortunate MON|RO. To his memory con&s;enting nations pay that ju&s;t tribute of applau&s;e, which his country in general, but this City and its Univer&s;ity in particular, ought to perpetuate by a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>By a WORTHY SELECT BAND of the numerous &s;tudents, who flocked from all quarters, allured by the ri&s;ing fame of the Edinburgh Univer&s;ity; this MEDICAL SOCIETY in 1737, was happily in&s;titu|ted. Of its various progre&s;s and pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing independent &s;tate, I pre&s;ume you to be well informed; and there|fore avoid attempting any particular hi&s;|torical narration of the&s;e circum&s;tances at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE BUILDING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The MEDICAL HALL,&mdash;A hand&s;ome Edi|fice of various elegant appartments with a <HI>Cupola</HI> and Spire, ornamented with the <HI>In&s;ignia</HI> of Ae&s;cu|lapius, erected chiefly by the liberal contributions of the Members.</NOTE> in which we are now
<PB N="11" REF="8">a&s;&s;embled is a grand <HI>phenomenon</HI> of medi|cal ardor, unparallelled in any country; and may ju&s;tly be regarded as a temple &s;acred to AESCULAPIUS, reared by the virtuous zeal of his youthful votaries, for purpo&s;es the mo&s;t liberal and prai&s;e|worthy. The FRIENDS OF SCIENCE, not of your number,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many Gentlemen, applauding the noble in|tentions of the Society, have been generou&s;ly plea&s;ed to contribute towards defraying the ex|pence of building the Hall,&mdash;Li&s;ts of whom are &s;u&s;pended in the principal appartment.</NOTE> who have generou&s;ly contributed towards its &s;tructure; are entitled to our mo&s;t grateful thanks.</P>
<P>Contemplating this FABRIC, and the many other aids which the pre&s;ent ad|vantageous &s;tate of our &s;ociety affords to facilitate &s;tudy; you mu&s;t have anti|cipated me in this reflection, that, while our minds are gratefully affected to our MERITORIOUS PREDECESSORS, our
<PB N="12" REF="9">every power ought to be exerted, if not to advance, at lea&s;t, to maintain our ex|tended reputation: that, the verdant lau|rels they have tran&s;mitted may not wi|ther in our hands, overwhelming us with indelible ignominy and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>'Tis with the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, I per|ceive, without being chargeable with adulation, I can fairly aver, that this So|ciety at no period of its exi&s;tence has been more &s;ecure of progre&s;s than at pre&s;ent: the learning, genius and manly liberality of &s;entiment, which I know you po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which, with much &s;atisfac|tion and in&s;truction, I have &s;o often ob|&s;erved animating your debates; con&s;titute the foundation on which this a&s;&s;ertion re&s;ts.</P>
<P>You are not to be informed that the com|bined powers of GENIUS and INDUSTRY mu&s;t per&s;everingly operate thro' the cour&s;e of &s;everal years, that a tolerably
<PB N="13" REF="10">complete knowledge of even the elemen|tary parts of the &s;cience of medicine, as already a&s;certained and taught, may be acquired. To have proceeded &s;o far in medical &s;tudy, is indeed to have made no de&s;picable progre&s;s: But I tru&s;t your ardent ambition is more a&s;piring than to remain &s;atisfied with the acqui&s;ition of a bare acquaintance of the <HI>dogmata</HI> of this, or the other MEDICAL SECT or PROFESSOR, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the healing art. It would be offering an unde&s;erved in&s;ult to your &s;agacity, were I but once to imagine, that you could entertain a be|lief, that the Medical Philo&s;ophy had al|ready attained the utmo&s;t perfection of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. You well know, that the unexplored regions of the <HI>terra incognita Medicinalis,</HI> &s;o to &s;peak, &s;till af|ford abundant &s;cope for your mo&s;t pro|tracted labours; &s;o ju&s;t is the ob&s;erva|tion, <HI>ars longa, vita brevis.</HI></P>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
<P>ANATOMY, as being the <HI>grand ba&s;is</HI> of the Medical Fabric, from the earlie&s;t periods of &s;ociety, in every civilized coun|try, has been cultivated with the mo&s;t unrelenting ardor of inve&s;tigation, which many mo&s;t material improvements have from time to time rewarded. Are there not &s;till, however, many very intere&s;ting parts and circum&s;tances of the &s;tructure of the ANIMAL AUTOMATON which we but little know? and many others of great importance, of which we are total|ly ignorant? What anatomi&s;t has hither|to been able &s;ucce&s;sfully to evolve the texture of the SPLEEN; an organ of con&s;iderable &s;ize, and probably of pro|portional importance in the animal oeco|nomy? Very lately it has been &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;ole fabricator of the globular part of the blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late ingenious Mr Hew&s;on of London, endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h this opinion.</NOTE>. The &s;ame que&s;tion may be put with re&s;pect to the &s;tructure of the MUSCULAR FIBRE, or LIVING SOLID;
<PB N="15" REF="12">and that SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION of the &s;everal orders of the SECRETORY ORGANS, upon which &s;uch a wonderful variety and oppo&s;ition of &s;ecreted liquors probably depends. But, above all, it may be put with re&s;pect to the BRAIN, and ITS APPENDAGES; parts e&s;&s;ential to life, often the &s;eat of di&s;ea&s;e, evidently variou&s;ly organized, of great volume and &s;urprizingly diver&s;ified in their external form.</P>
<P>I will be pardoned for expre&s;&s;ing my fears, that few anatomical improvements are to be expected from you while re&s;i|ding in this country; at lea&s;t, while its pre&s;ent TONE continues, however great your ability and ardor: becau&s;e an in&s;u|perable barrier is oppo&s;ed to your pro|gre&s;s; I mean the WANT OF PRIVATE DISSECTION. In the end of the eight|teenth century, when philo&s;ophical libera|lity is diffu&s;ed from Pole to Pole, what a
<PB N="16" REF="13">pity, or rather what a &s;hame, that, even in the Metropolis of a kingdom, not un|civilized, and in its principal Univer&s;i|ty too, where the circle of education is otherwi&s;e tolerably complete; this GRAND and almo&s;t ONLY AVENUE to the AESCULAPIAN Temple, &s;hould re|main mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly blocked up!</P>
<P>A public cour&s;e of anatomical demon|&s;tration, exceeded by none, and equalled by few, is, I confe&s;s, annually made here; by a learned, di&s;cerning, accurate, inde|fatigable Profe&s;&s;or: whom none of you can more re&s;pect than I do. I, notwith|&s;tanding, he&s;itate not to declare it as my po&s;itive opinion, and I will venture to &s;ay it is not &s;olitary, that, no public anatomi|cal exhibitions, where the &s;tudent is mere|ly a PASSIVE SPECTATOR, are &s;ufficient to convey and impre&s;s tho&s;e preci&s;e and multifarious ideas of this important branch of natural knowledge, ab&s;olute|ly requi&s;ite to complete the medical
<PB N="17" REF="14">character; throwing di&s;covery altogether out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>To acquire a tolerable knowledge of even the great outlines of anatomy, it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to take the knife in hand, and, with the mo&s;t unremitting attention, di&s;&s;ect a variety of bodies of different &s;izes, ages, and &s;exes, properly cho&s;en, and prepared for the purpo&s;e: Much more mu&s;t this plan be followed, if it be propo&s;ed to &s;oar in the regions of di&s;covery and improvement. I can ex|perimentally a&s;&s;ert, that more anatomical information will be reaped from the well conducted di&s;&s;ection of one body, than from repeated public cour&s;es.</P>
<P>If this opinion be well founded, it is a &s;elf-evident con&s;equence, that attending one or two public cour&s;es of anatomy, mu&s;t be much inadequate to accompli&s;h the medical philo&s;opher; e&s;pecially, if the practice of &s;urgery, the mo&s;t evident|ly u&s;eful part of the healing art, be his
<PB N="18" REF="15">de&s;tination. Humanity revolts at the idea of the many unavoidable, and, I fear, too often fatal blunders that mu&s;t re&s;ult from this capital defect of the me|dical education to be obtained in this country. It is abundantly mortifying indeed, to ob&s;erve tho&s;e who wi&s;h to at|tain a proper degree of anatomical know|ledge, after &s;pending &s;everal years at our Univer&s;ities, and probably attaining their highe&s;t honours, reduced to the alterna|tive of either undertaking expen&s;ive ex|peditions into foreign countries, in this re&s;pect more civilized than ours; or of remaining dangerou&s;ly uninformed.</P>
<P>If one &s;hould attempt to adju&s;t the wheels and &s;prings of a nice and delicate mechani&s;m, he, perhaps, had never be|fore &s;een, or, at lea&s;t, never minutely con&s;idered; with what indignant contempt would we treat the rude audacious pre|tender? Thou&s;ands, alas! are daily &s;ub|jected
<PB N="19" REF="16">to the unpracti&s;ed knife of opera|tors of nece&s;&s;ity aukward, I had almo&s;t &s;aid un&s;killed; becau&s;e they never could enjoy the requi&s;ite opportunity, of either acquiring proper dexterity to perform any propo&s;ed operation with due addre&s;s; or full knowledge of the parts concern|ed: from the want of acce&s;s to the dead human body.</P>
<P>This alarming con&s;ideration is &s;urely of &s;ufficient force to conquer the vulgar prejudices again&s;t private di&s;&s;ection, whe|ther the offspring of &s;uper&s;tition or igno|rance. The violation of the &s;epulchre or the clande&s;tine robbery of the tomb, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly regarded as a crime of a deep dye; but certainly private di&s;&s;ecti|on, under proper regulations, is compa|tible with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ecurity in this re&s;pect. Of this the practice of mo&s;t of the European countries is an ir|refragable proof; <HI>viz.</HI> of the&s;e countries to which our &s;tudents are compelled to
<PB N="20" REF="17">re&s;ort, to obtain opportunities of diffec|ting which might &s;o ea&s;ily be afforded at home. Were a proportional number of dead human bodies annually furni&s;hed by authority, to the medical Students in the different towns of Scotland in gene|ral, and to tho&s;e attending our Univer&s;i|ties, in particular, for private di&s;&s;ection: the &s;alutary con&s;equences would &s;oon &s;urpa&s;s conception. It is truly a&s;toni&s;h|ing, that a matter of &s;uch endle&s;s impor|tance had not, long e'er now, challenged the notice, and rou&s;ed the attention of the HONOURABLE SUPERINTENDANTS of our Police, or even of the LEGISLA|TURE it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Criminal</HI> and <HI>Flagitious,</HI> whether they expire under the hands of the exe|cutioner, or by di&s;ea&s;e; ought always to be con&s;igned to the anatomical knife: that thus, in &s;ome degree, when dead, they may attone to &s;ociety for their de|predation
<PB N="21" REF="18">and turbulence when alive. Public utility &s;eems likewi&s;e to have a good title to the u&s;e of the dead bo|dies of tho&s;e who by idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, have rendered them&s;elves objects of public charity; and con&s;equently, per|haps for many years, have been cloathed and fed at the public expence.</P>
<P>Humanity, Patrioti&s;m, and even &s;elf-intere&s;t con&s;pire, to &s;timulate every in|dividual to promote, at lea&s;t, not to op|po&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mea&s;ure &s;o pregnant with the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages to mankind. The advancing liberality of this country, affords the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;ons to hope that the au&s;picious <HI>Aera</HI> is not very di&s;tant, when medical improve|ment &s;hall be no more retarded by the impo&s;&s;ibility of acquiring anatomical in|formation in the only way that it can be acquired; a mi&s;chief hitherto &s;o op|probrious, fatal, and gigantic.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="19">
<P>If Anatomy be defective, PHISIOLOGY which teaches the functions of the va|rious organs and parts detected by ana|tomy, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be proportionally defective. Not only is this the fact, but the u&s;es even of many parts which the anatomi&s;t has de&s;cribed with tolerable ac|curacy, are far, very far, from being &s;uf|ficiently explained by the phi&s;iologi&s;t; <HI>e. g.</HI> Of &s;everal of the GENERATIVE ORGANS, of the DIFFERENT SUB|STANCES and PROTUBERANCES of the BRAIN, of the GANGLIONS, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In like manner, many of the gene|ral laws and principles of the living &s;y&s;|tem are not illu&s;trated with &s;atisfactory preci&s;ion; while one phy&s;iologi&s;t affirms that MENSTRUATION depends on TO|PICAL, another refers it to GENERAL PLETHORA. Some contend that NUTRI|TION is effected by the NERVES, others by the VESSELS: and a variety of facts
<PB N="23" REF="20">are artfully adduced, to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e oppo&s;ite doctrines. With re&s;pect to many other phy&s;iological di&s;qui&s;itions the &s;ame contrariety of opinion exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>If the que&s;tion be put, "What &s;hall be &s;aid when Doctors di&s;agree?" I reply, recur to nature, collect u&s;eful facts, from them draw manly, liberal, cha&s;te con|clu&s;ions; di&s;regard ideal, cobweb, flim&s;y theories, the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion. GENERAL PRINCIPLES, rationally de|duced as corrollaries from e&s;tabli&s;hed facts, only, in my opinion, can ju&s;tly claim the dignified appellation of THEO|RY.</P>
<P>PATHOLOGY, you know, treats of the MORBID STATES of animal nature, with a view to effect their PREVENTION, AL|LEVIATION or CURE. Many anatomical and phy&s;iological &s;peculations are more curious than u&s;eful, and may, therefore, altho' not &s;trictly ju&s;t, have the merit
<PB N="24" REF="21">of being innocent. Pathological di&s;qui|&s;itions, on the contrary, mu&s;t always pro|duce the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equences; be|cau&s;e they influence the medical conduct of di&s;ea&s;e. Our &s;mall knowledge, or rather our great ignorance, of this depart|ment, affords but a melancholy theme to the anxious philo&s;ophic inquirer. The va|riety and oppo&s;ition, the ab&s;urdity and confu&s;ion of numberle&s;s futile conceits, wild imaginations, fanciful opinions, dig|nified for&s;ooth with the name of DOCT|RINES, are the <HI>opprobrium</HI> of the medi|cal profe&s;&s;ion: and pre&s;ent to the con|templative mind, the idea of primaeval <HI>Chaos,</HI> when darkne&s;s brooded over the great aby&s;s.</P>
<P>Altho' I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ability, neither your time nor patience permit me to attempt a particular enumeration of the &s;triking ab&s;urdities, which have, in a great de|gree, hitherto overwhelmed pathology,
<PB N="25" REF="22">depre&s;&s;ing medicine far beneath the rank of her &s;i&s;ter arts; becau&s;e the&s;e arts are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the evolved un|alterable laws of nature.</P>
<P>One cla&s;s of pathologi&s;ts have recour&s;e to the SENSIBLE QUALITIES of the AT|MOSPHERE, as chiefly contributing to create the numerous and important tribe of febrile di&s;orders; and endeavour to &s;upport their rea&s;onings by meteorologi|cal regi&s;ters and ob&s;ervations without end. With equal confidence, another tribe, di&s;regarding in a great mea&s;ure, this opinion, mu&s;ter up INVISIBLE MIAS|MATA and FLOATING POISONS, to untie every gordian knot; either as principal agents, or complete efficients. In like manner, while the favourite &s;y&s;tem of one period, refers us, with much plau&s;ibility, to the FLUIDS, and MORBIFIC MATTER there exi&s;ting, for the SEAT and CAUSES of many di&s;ea&s;es; that of another, with
<PB N="26" REF="23">at lea&s;t equal probability, directs our at|tention almo&s;t &s;olely to SPASM and other AFFECTIONS of the SOLIDS.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid here to remark, that were the &s;cience of medicine like fluxi|ons, infinite&s;imals, the quadrature of the circle, <HI>&amp;c. i. e.</HI> purely a matter of curious unintere&s;ting &s;peculation; we might view the FLUCTUATING INSTA|BILITY of its DOGMATA or DOCTRINES, as they are called; with the &s;ame Tone of mind with which we contemplate the fanta&s;tic &s;hiftings of the <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> or vi&s;ions of the night. But how diame|trically oppo&s;ite mu&s;t be the feelings of humanity, reflecting that the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive doctrines have re&s;pectively, during their fa&s;hionable periods of domination, greatly influenced the medical management of di&s;ea&s;e; compelling the pa&s;&s;ive entramel|led, bewildered practitioner, to employ the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite curative means, in the
<PB N="27" REF="24">&s;ame morbid &s;tates: the con&s;equent ha|vock, deva&s;tation, and ma&s;&s;acre of man|kind is more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cri|bed.</P>
<P>The ancient maxim <Q><HI>"in medio tuti&s;&s;i|mus ibis,"</HI></Q> &s;hould perhaps never be en|tirely neglected. It &s;eems exceedingly probable <HI>a priori,</HI> that, the fluids being made or elaborated by the &s;olids; and the&s;e, on the other hand, &s;upported by the fluids; their affections will not long remain di&s;tinct, but rather always be re|ciprocal: However,
<Q>"Non no&s;trum tantas componere lites."</Q></P>
<P>Moreover, how little we do know with tolerable certainty, re&s;pecting the IM|PRESSIONS made on the SENTIENT PARTS of our bodies, by what are named the <HI>potentiae nocentes;</HI> or of the DERANGE|MENT of ORGANIZATION; or of the NUMBER and NATURE of the MORBID ALTERATIONS thence con&s;equent! yet
<PB N="28" REF="25">it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e particulars be marked with the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible preci&s;ion. For in&s;tance, we are told, that there are two <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of FE|BRILE DELIRIUM, requiring the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite treatment; but who has hither|to pointed out, with &s;ufficient accuracy, the &s;ymptoms a&s;certaining their important di&s;crimination? If, therefore, in &s;uch a perilous predicament the GENIUS of blunder &s;hould but for a moment over|cloud the practitioner's di&s;cernment, which is a very &s;uppo&s;able, but I hope, a rare occurence; <HI>conclamatum e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>'Till pathology, therefore, is more de|termined and complete, don't ca&s;es be&s;et with dubiety and peril, &s;eem ju&s;tly to de|mand a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities (&s;o to &s;peak) or of our therapeutic efforts; which, permit me to &s;ay, may often with ju&s;tice be termed the impertinence of art? The&s;e daring practitioners, who in
<PB N="29" REF="26">the advanced critical febrile &s;tates, which they by no means under&s;tand, exhibit FEBRIFUGE NOSTRUMS,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as James's Powders.</NOTE> with a teme|rity that equally &s;hocks our feelings, and alarms our fears; may not ineptly be compared to the nonplus'd &s;tate&s;man; who, to &s;mother di&s;&s;ention and broil, of which his mal-admini&s;tration is probably the cau&s;e, ri&s;ks the very exi&s;tence of the &s;tate it&s;elf, by plunging it headlong into general combu&s;tion, and foreign war.</P>
<P>It is with much plea&s;ure I acknow|ledge, that, in this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential depart|ment of the medical philo&s;ophy, light and order happily begin to diffu&s;e their genial influence over darkne&s;s and con|fu&s;ion. The GENIUS and LABOURS of &s;ome whom this Society can reckon among her honorary &s;ons, have al|ready contributed, in no &s;mall degree,
<PB N="30" REF="27">to this mo&s;t de&s;irable purpo&s;e. I am confident I &s;peak your &s;entiments, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly my own, when I mention with the mo&s;t particular gratitude, the great advantages we have &s;o often and &s;o happily reaped in our inquiries, from the CULLENIAN NOSOLOGY: a work per|&s;picuous tho' conci&s;e, elaborate yet not voluminous, in every part demon&s;trative of the liberal views, and exten&s;ive medi|cal erudition of its very re&s;pectable and accompli&s;hed author, who with truth may &s;ay,
<Q>"Exegi monumentum aere perennius."</Q></P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing ju&s;t indications of cure to be formed, in con&s;equence of an advan|ced and cha&s;te pathology, to be then provided with proper and active AGENTS or REMEDIES to fulfil the&s;e indications; becomes a matter of mo&s;t important con|cern. The jarring opinions of authors
<PB N="31" REF="28">re&s;pecting the nature, activity, do&s;e and mode of exhibition, of almo&s;t every ar|ticle of the MATERIA MEDICA; pre&s;ent a mo&s;t exten&s;ive field for u&s;eful experi|ment and inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to medical improvement, I &s;hall only in general add, that, your ex|pectations, in my opinion, are le&s;s likely to be fru&s;trated, if you look for it to re|&s;ult more from anatomical phy&s;iological and pathological progre&s;s, than from the di&s;covery of any addition to the Materia Medica. This part of the medical &s;ci|ence is by no means to be neglected, altho' it be probable, that advancing but a &s;ingle &s;tep in any of the other walks, may be productive of more real and &s;olid im|provement and utility, than the acqui&s;i|tion of a thou&s;and &s;imples; if it be true, that it is an ea&s;ier bu&s;ine&s;s to fulfil, than in&s;titute proper curative indications.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="29">
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured that the PHYSICIAN towers above the <HI>Empiric,</HI> the <HI>nur&s;e</HI> and <HI>old wo|man</HI> almo&s;t only in proportion to his &s;u|perior information re&s;pecting the PARTS, the LAWS, and MORBID STATES of ani|mal nature; the more perfect his acquire|ments in the&s;e particulars, the higher his pre-eminence among the &s;ons of Ae&s;cu|lapius. No mode of inauguration how|ever &s;olemn, no academic rites or autho|rity however great or antient, can elevate to the honourable rank of Phy&s;ician, a per&s;on of an oppo&s;ite de&s;cription. Such a one could only be regarded as an EMPTY DIGNIFIED FORM, around who&s;e blighting temples, the VENAL, the SURREPTITIOUS, the PROSTITUTED LAURELS of APOL|LO mu&s;t ba&s;ely fade to the utter di&s;credit of all concerned; a more melancholy con&s;equence &s;till would be, that his prac|tice could not fail to prove the bane of &s;o|ciety, operating the de&s;truction of &s;uch in|dividuals
<PB N="33" REF="30">as might become the unfortu|nate &s;ubjects of his temerity.</P>
<P>If therefore to become a Phy&s;ician, (<HI>i. e.</HI> to be qualified to mark with preci|&s;ion, the almo&s;t infinitely various affec|tions of animated matter, &s;o as to direct, as far as may be, its movements to the bli&s;sful abode of longaevity and health,) be a ta&s;k only terminating with life, to be exhau&s;ted by no labour, and to which the mo&s;t di&s;criminating mental powers are not &s;uperior; the folly, not to &s;ay criminality of attempts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such as tho&s;e of TISSOT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> to incite vulgar vanity to tamper with the mo&s;t precious intere&s;ts of mankind, needs no illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>In every &s;pecies of philo&s;ophical inve&s;|tigation, particularly tho&s;e of a medical nature, where certainty is &s;o difficultly attained; to guard again&s;t CREDULITY, is a coun&s;el, I deem of &s;uch infinite im|portance, that, before I put an end to this
<PB N="34" REF="31">addre&s;s, I cannot help tendering it in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to the particular no|tice of my YOUNGER SOCII. In all ca&s;es, where there is not ab&s;olute de|mon&s;tration, or at lea&s;t as high a degree of evidence, as the nature of the argu|ment admits; to &s;u&s;pend belief or to ex|erci&s;e a proper degree of &s;ceptici&s;m, till mature examination and reflection &s;hall compel a&s;&s;ent: I regard as a mea&s;ure pru|dent, rational and philo&s;ophic. The un|&s;upported <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> of any man, however great his name in &s;cience, I always con|&s;ider as a very weak argument: Recan|tation at be&s;t is exceedingly di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of our Society, or its pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of laws, I am far from reckoning perfect; many meliorations, I doubt not will be made from time to time. No good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why our meetings &s;hould be &s;u&s;pend|ed during half the year: In &s;ummer in|deed
<PB N="35" REF="32">they might probably be thin; but it does not follow, that your &s;peculations on that account would be le&s;s in&s;tructive, or your e&s;&s;ays more imperfect.</P>
<P>I conclude by congratulating you up|on your affairs being now happily in &s;uch a pro&s;perous train, as to afford the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pects. I contemplate the ri&s;ing glory, and future greatne&s;s of the Medical Society, with no &s;mall degree of plea&s;urable ec&s;ta&s;y and expectation: Methinks, I hear its TOWERING GENIUS with the mo&s;t complacent exultation ex|claim <Q><HI>"&s;ublimi feriam &s;idera vertice."</HI></Q></P>
