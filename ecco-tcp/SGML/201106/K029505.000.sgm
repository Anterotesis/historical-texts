<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT Of the MANNER of Inoculating for the SMALL POX in the EAST INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>ON peru&s;ing lately &s;ome tracts upon the &s;ubject of Inoculation, I deter|mined to put together a few notes relative to the manner of Inoculation, practi&s;ed, time out of mind, by <HI>the Bramins of Indo&s;tan;</HI> to this I was chiefly in&s;tigated, by con&s;idering the great benefit that may ari&s;e to mankind from a knowledge of this foreign method, which &s;o remarkably tends to &s;upport the practice now generally fol|lowed with &s;uch marvellous &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>By Dr. SCHULTZ's account of Inocula|tion, page 65. note (9), it &s;hould &s;eem,
<PB N="2" REF="4">that the world has been already obliged with a performance of the kind which I have now undertaken, by a Dutch author, a friend of Mr. CHAIS; but as this is all I know of that work, it &s;hall not di&s;cou|rage my proceeding with my own, the more e&s;pecially as that performance is in a foreign language, and may not much be|nefit my country.</P>
<P>As many years are elap&s;ed, &s;ince a theme of this nature has employed my thoughts and attention; I will hope for every favor|able indulgence from the candor of that learned and re&s;pectable Body, to who&s;e judgment I mo&s;t readily &s;ubmit the follow|ing hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It has been lately remarked by a learned and judicious ornament of the College of Phy&s;icians, <Q>"That the Art of Medicine has, in &s;everal in&s;tances, been greatly indebted to Accident; and that &s;ome of its mo&s;t valuable improvements have been received from the hands of Igno|rance and Barbari&s;m; a Truth, remark|ably
<PB N="3" REF="5">exemplified in the practice of IN|OCULATION of the SMALL POX."</Q>&mdash;However ju&s;t <HI>in general</HI> this learned Gen|tleman's remark may be, he will, as to his <HI>particular reference,</HI> be &s;urprized to find, that nearly the &s;ame &s;alutary method, now &s;o happily pur&s;ued in England, (how&s;oever it has been &s;eemingly blundered upon) has the &s;anction of remote&s;t antiquity; but in|deed with &s;ome variations, that will rather illu&s;trate the propriety of the pre&s;ent Prac|tice, and promote the obvious very laud|able intention, with which that Gentle|man publi&s;hed his late E&s;&s;ay on this inter|e&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The general &s;tate of this di&s;temper in the Provinces of Bengall (to which the&s;e ob&s;er|vations are limited) is &s;uch, that for five and &s;ometimes &s;ix years together, it pa&s;&s;es in a manner unnoticed, from the few that are attacked with it; for the complexion of it in the&s;e years is generally &s;o benign as to cau&s;e very little alarm; and notwith|&s;tanding the multitudes that are every year inoculated in the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on, it adds no
<PB N="4" REF="6">malignity to the di&s;ea&s;e taken in the natu|ral way, nor &s;preads the infection, as is commonly imagined in Europe. Every &s;e|venth year, with &s;carcely any exception, the Small Pox rages epidemically in the&s;e Provinces, during the months of March, April, and May; and &s;ometimes until the annual returning rains, about the middle of June, put a &s;top to its fury. On the&s;e pe|riodical returns (to four of which I have been a witne&s;s) the di&s;ea&s;e proves univer|&s;ally of the mo&s;t malignant confluent kind, from which few either of the natives or Europeans e&s;caped, that took the di&s;tem|per in the natural way, commonly dying on the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third day of the eruption; and yet, Inoculation in the Ea&s;t, has <HI>natural fears</HI> and <HI>&s;uper&s;titious preju|dices</HI> to encounter, as well as in the We&s;t. The u&s;ual re&s;ource of the Europeans is to fly from the &s;ettlements, and retire into the country before the return of the Small Pox &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingularly worth remarking, that there hardly ever was an in&s;tance of a na|tive
<PB N="5" REF="7">of the I&s;land of St. Helena, man or woman, that was &s;eized with this di&s;tem|per in the natural way (when re&s;ident in Bengall,) who e&s;caped with life; altho' it is a known fact the di&s;ea&s;e never yet got footing upon that I&s;land. Clearly to ac|count for this, is not an ea&s;y matter; I will venture, however, a few conjectures on the occa&s;ion. The&s;e people rarely migrate from the I&s;land before they arrive at years of maturity; the ba&s;is of their diet there, from their infancy, is a root called <HI>yam,</HI> of a <HI>&s;kran&s;hee kind,</HI> a term they u&s;e to expre&s;s its acrid, unwhole&s;ome qualities, which frequently &s;ubjects them to epidemic and dangerous dy&s;enteries, and &s;ometimes epi|demic putrid &s;ore throats. The blood thus charged, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;titute a mo&s;t unlucky habit of body to combat with any acute inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e what&s;oever, but more e&s;pecially of the kind under con&s;ide|ration (&s;o frequently attended with a high degree of putrefaction,) always fatal to the&s;e people, even in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when the di&s;ea&s;e is mild and favorable to others: But indeed it is a general remark, that a
<PB N="6" REF="8">St. Helenian rarely e&s;capes when &s;eized with the Small Pox in what&s;oever part of the Globe he happens to re&s;ide. The &s;ame has been ob&s;erved of the African Coffries, altho' I know not what cau&s;e to a&s;cribe it to, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e one &s;imilar to that above mentioned, to wit, &s;ome fundamen|tal aggravating principle in their chief diet. Be this as it may, that the&s;e two portions of the human &s;pecies &s;eem peculiarly marked as victims to this di&s;ea&s;e, is a fact indi&s;pu|table, let the cau&s;e be what it will.</P>
<P>Having thus far premi&s;ed touching the general &s;tate of this di&s;temper in the Pro|vinces of Bengall, (which I believe is nearly applicable to every other part of the Em|pire) I will only add a few words re&s;pect|ing the duration of it in Indo&s;tan, and then ha&s;ten to the principal intention of this &s;hort E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>The learned Doctor FREIND in his Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ic from the time of GALEN, has this remarkable pa&s;&s;age: <Q>"By the earlie&s;t account we have of the Small Pox, we find it fir&s;t appeared in <HI>Aegypt</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="9">in the time of <HI>Omar,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;or to <HI>Maho|met:</HI> though no doubt, &s;ince the <HI>Greeks</HI> knew nothing of it, the <HI>Arabians</HI> brought it from their own country, and might derive it originally from &s;ome of the more di&s;tant regions of the <HI>Ea&s;t."</HI></Q> The &s;agacity of this conclu&s;ion, later times and di&s;coveries has fully verified; at the period in which the <HI>Aughtorrah Bhade</HI> &s;criptures of the Gentoos were promulged, (according to the Bramins three thou&s;and three hun|dred and &s;ixty &s;ix years ago;) this di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t then have been of &s;ome &s;tanding, as tho&s;e &s;criptures in&s;titute a form of divine wor&s;hip, with <HI>Poojahs,</HI> or offerings, to a female Divinity, &s;tiled by the common peo|ple <HI>Gootee ka Tagooran</HI> (the Godde&s;s of Spots,) who&s;e aid and patronage are in|voked during the continuance of the Small Pox &s;ea&s;on, al&s;o in the Mea&s;les, and every cutaneous Eruption that is in the &s;malle&s;t degree epidemical. Due weight being given to this circum&s;tance, the long dura|tion of the Di&s;ea&s;e in Indo&s;tan will mani|fe&s;tly appear; and we, may add to the &s;agacious conjecture ju&s;t quoted, that not
<PB N="8" REF="10">only the <HI>Arabians,</HI> but the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> al&s;o, by their early commerce with India through the Red Sea and Gulf of Mocha, mo&s;t cer|tainly derived originally the Small Pox (and probably the Mea&s;les likewi&s;e) from that country, where tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have reigned from the earlie&s;t known times.</P>
<P>Inoculation is performed in Indo&s;tan by a particular tribe of Bramins, who are delegated annually for this &s;ervice from the different Colleges of Bindoobund, Eleabas, Banaras, &amp;c. over all the di&s;tant Provinces; dividing them&s;elves into &s;mall parties, of three or four each, they plan their travel|ling circuits in &s;uch wi&s;e as to arrive at the places of their re&s;pective de&s;tination &s;ome weeks before the u&s;ual return of the di&s;ea&s;e; they arrive commonly in the Bengall Pro|vinces early in February, although they &s;ome years do not begin to inoculate be|fore March, deferring it untill they con&s;ider the &s;tate of the &s;ea&s;on, and acquire infor|mation of the &s;tate of the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The year in Bengall can properly be di|vided into three &s;ea&s;ons only, of four
<PB N="9" REF="11">months each; from the middle of June to the middle of October is the rainy &s;ea&s;on; from the middle of October to the middle of February is the cold &s;ea&s;on, which never ri&s;es to a degree of freezing; the whole globe does not yield a more de|&s;irable or delightful climate than Bengall during the&s;e four months; but the freedom of living, which the Europeans fall into at this &s;ea&s;on, &s;ow the &s;eeds of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which &s;pring up in all the &s;ucceeding months of the year. From the middle of February to the middle of June is the hot, windy, dry &s;ea&s;on; during which no rain falls but what comes in &s;torms of fierce winds and tremendous thunder and light|ning, called North We&s;ters, the quarter they always ri&s;e from; and the Provinces, particularly Bengall, is more or le&s;s healthy, in proportion to the number of the&s;e &s;torms; when in this &s;ea&s;on the air is frequently agitated and refre&s;hed with the&s;e North We&s;ters, accompanied with rain, (for they are often dry,) and the inhabitants do not expo&s;e them&s;elves to the inten&s;e &s;un and violent hot winds that blow in March,
<PB N="10" REF="12">April, and May, it is generally found to be the mo&s;t healthy of the year; otherwi&s;e (as in the year 1744, when we had no rain from the twentieth of October to the twentieth of June) this &s;ea&s;on produces high inflammatory di&s;orders of the liver, brea&s;t, pleura, and inte&s;tines, with dy&s;enteries, and a deplorable &s;pecies of the Small-Pox.</P>
<P>From the middle of July (the &s;econd month of the rainy &s;ea&s;on) there is little or no wind, a &s;tagnation of air follows, and during the remainder of this month, and the months of Augu&s;t and September, the atmo&s;phere is loaded with &s;uffocating heat and moi&s;ture, the parents of putre|faction; and nervous putrid fevers (ap|proaching &s;ometimes to pe&s;tilential) take the lead, and mark the dangerous &s;ea&s;on; from the&s;e fevers the Natives frequently recover, but the Europeans &s;eldom, e&s;pe|cially if they in the preceding May and June indulged too freely in tho&s;e two <HI>be|witching delicacies, Mangos</HI> and <HI>Mango Fi&s;h,</HI> indi&s;criminately with the free u&s;e of <HI>fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>wine;</HI> for the&s;e <HI>(all together)</HI> load the whole habit with impurities, and
<PB N="11" REF="13">never fail of yielding Death a plentiful harve&s;t, in the three la&s;t months of this putrid &s;ea&s;on: If any are &s;eized with the Small-Pox in the&s;e months, it is ever of the mo&s;t malignant kind, and u&s;ually fa|tal. It will not, I hope, be deemed a u&s;ele&s;s digre&s;&s;ion, if I be&s;tow a few re|marks on the nature of this <HI>Bengall Fever.</HI></P>
<P>A day or two before the &s;eizure, the patient finds his appetite fall off, feels an unaccountable la&s;&s;itude, and failure in the natural moi&s;ture of the mouth, is low &s;pi|rited without any apparent cau&s;e, and can|not &s;leep as u&s;ual; but having no acute complaint what&s;oever, nor preternatural heat, that &s;hould indicate a fever, he at|tributes the whole to the heat of the &s;ea|&s;on, is &s;atisfied with fa&s;ting and confine|ment to his hou&s;e, or goes abroad among&s;t his friends to "&s;hake it off," as the com|mon phra&s;e is; but on the third day, find|ing every one of the&s;e &s;ymptoms increa&s;e, he begins to think &s;omething is really the matter with him, and the Phy&s;ician is called in: thus the only period is lo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="14">wherein art might be of any u&s;e; for in the cour&s;e of eighteen years practice I ne|ver knew an in&s;tance of recovery from this genuine fever, where the fir&s;t three days had elap&s;ed without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the patient in this ca&s;e dyed on the fifth or &s;eventh day. In &s;ome, this fever is at|tended with a full, equal, undi&s;turbed pul&s;e, but obviou&s;ly greatly <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed;</HI> in others, with a low and <HI>depre&s;&s;ed</HI> one, but equal and undi&s;turbed al&s;o, and yet both re|quired the &s;ame treatment. New comers in the profe&s;&s;ion, have been often fatally mi&s;led by the full pul&s;e, which they thought indicated the lo&s;s of blood; they followed the &s;ugge&s;tion, the pul&s;e &s;uddenly fell, and when that happens from this cau&s;e, the art of man can never rai&s;e it again, the patient dies on the fifth or &s;e|venth day; and the con&s;equence was ex|actly the &s;ame, if Nature, being overloaded, attempted to free her&s;elf of part of the burden by a natural haemorrhage, or by the inte&s;tines, on the &s;econd or third day, (which I have often &s;een) they proved equally fatal as the launcet. Until the
<PB N="13" REF="15">clo&s;e of the &s;ixth day the &s;kin and urine pre&s;erved a natural &s;tate; but if at this period of the fever the &s;kin &s;uddenly ac|quired an inten&s;e heat, and the urine grew crude and limpid, it was a &s;ure pre&s;age of death on the &s;eventh. The natural cri&s;is of this fever, when attacked in the very beginning, and treated judiciou&s;ly, was re|gularly on the eleventh day, and appeared in a multitude of &s;mall boils, chiefly upon the head, or in &s;mall watery bladders thrown out upon the &s;urface of the &s;kin, but in the greate&s;t abundance on the brea&s;t, neck, throat, and forehead; both of the&s;e cri|tical appearances are con&s;tantly preceded, on the tenth day, by a copious &s;ediment and &s;eparation in the urine. If by any inadvertent expo&s;ure to the cold air, the&s;e critical eruptions were &s;truck in, the re|pelled matter in&s;tantly fell upon the brain, and convul&s;ions and death followed in a few hours, and &s;mall purple &s;pots remain|ed in the places of the eruptions. Such is the <HI>genuine putrid nervous fever of Ben|gall,</HI> which never gave way properly to any treatment but that of bli&s;ters applied
<PB N="14" REF="16">univer&s;ally, &s;upported by the &s;tronge&s;t alexipharmics: &s;ometimes I have &s;een the cri&s;is (by un&s;kilful management) &s;pun out to the twenty-fir&s;t day, but it has been ever imperfect, and the patient is harra&s;|&s;ed with intermittents or diarrhoeas, and commonly dies in the beginning of the cold &s;ea&s;on; but if he is of a &s;trong con|&s;titution, he lingers on, in a dying way, until the month of February, which u&s;u|ally gives &s;ome turn in his favor, but his health is hardly ever re-e&s;tabli&s;hed before the &s;alutary <HI>mango &s;ea&s;on,</HI> which fruit, eaten with <HI>milk,</HI> proves an effectual and never-failing re&s;torative. But to re&s;ume our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Bengall, knowing the u&s;ual time when the Inoculating Bramins annually return, ob&s;erve &s;trictly the regi|men enjoined, whether they determine to be inoculated or not; this preparation con|&s;i&s;ts only in ab&s;taining for a month from fi&s;h, milk, and ghee, (a kind of butter made generally of buffalo's milk;) the prohibition of fi&s;h re&s;pects only the native
<PB N="15" REF="17">Portugue&s;e and Mahomedans, who abound in every Province of the Empire.</P>
<P>When the Bramins begin to Inoculate, they pa&s;s from hou&s;e to hou&s;e and operate at the door, refu&s;ing to inoculate any who have not, on a &s;trict &s;crutiny, duly ob&s;erved the preparatory cour&s;e enjoined them. It is no uncommon thing for them to a&s;k the Parents how many Pocks they chu&s;e their Children &s;hould have: Vanity, we &s;hould think, urged a que&s;tion on a matter &s;eem|ingly &s;o uncertain in the i&s;&s;ue; but true it is, that they hardly ever exceed, or are deficient, in the number required.</P>
<P>They inoculate indifferently on any part, but if left to their choice, they prefer the out&s;ide of the arm, mid-way between the wri&s;t and the elbow, for the males; and the &s;ame between the elbow and the &s;houlder for the females. Previous to the operation the Operator takes a piece of cloth in his hand, (which becomes his perqui&s;ite if the family is opulent,) and with it gives a dry friction upon the part intended for Inoculation, for the &s;pace of
<PB N="16" REF="18">eight or ten minutes, then with a &s;mall in&s;trument he wounds, by many &s;light touches, about the compa&s;s of a &s;ilver groat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The in&s;trument they make u&s;e of, is of iron, about four inches and a half long, and of the &s;ize of a large crow quill, the middle is twi&s;ted, and the one end is &s;teeled and flatted about an inch from the extremity, and the eighth of an inch broad; this extremity is brought to a very keen edge, and two &s;harp corners; the other end of the in&s;trument is an ear-picker, and the in&s;trument is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as the Barbers of Indo&s;tan u&s;e to cut the nails, and depurate the ears of their cu&s;tomers, (for in that country, we are above performing either of the&s;e operations our&s;elves.) The Operator of Inoculation holds the in&s;trument as we hold a pen, and with dextrous expedition gives about fifteen or &s;ixteen minute &s;carifications (within the compa&s;s above|mentioned) with one of the &s;harp corners of the in&s;trument, and to the&s;e various little wounds, I believe may be a&s;cribed the di&s;charge which almo&s;t con&s;tantly flows from the part in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. I cannot help thinking that too much has been &s;aid (pro and con) about nothing, re|&s;pecting the different methods preferred by different Practi|tioners of performing the operation; provided the matter is thrown into the blood, it is certainly a con&s;ideration of mo&s;t trivial import by what means it is effected; if any claims a preference, I &s;hould conclude it &s;hould be that me|thod which bids faire&s;t for &s;ecuring a plentiful di&s;charge from the ulcer.</NOTE>, ju&s;t making the &s;malle&s;t appear|ance of blood, then opening a linen dou|ble rag (which he always keeps in a cloth round his wai&s;t) takes from thence a &s;mall pledgit of cotton charged with the vari|olous matter, which he moi&s;tens with two or three drops of the <HI>Ganges</HI> water, and applies it to the wound, fixing it on
<PB N="17" REF="19">with a &s;light bandage, and ordering it to remain on for &s;ix hours without being moved, then the bandage to be taken off, and the pledget to remain until it falls off it&s;elf; &s;ometimes (but rarely) he &s;queezes a drop from the pledget, upon the part, before he applies it; from the time he begins the dry friction, to the tying the knot of the bandage, he never cea&s;es reciting &s;ome portions of the wor|&s;hip appointed, by the <HI>Aughtorrah Bhade,</HI> to be paid to the female Divinity before-mentioned, nor quits the mo&s;t &s;olemn countenance all the while. The cotton, which he pre&s;erves in a double callico rag, is &s;aturated with matter from the inoculated pu&s;tules of the preceding year, for they never inoculate with fre&s;h mat|ter, nor with matter from the di&s;ea&s;e caught in the natural way, however di&s;tinct and mild the &s;pecies. He then proceeds to give in&s;tructions for the treat|ment of the patient through the cour&s;e of the proce&s;s, which are mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved; the&s;e are as follow:</P>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<P>He extends the prohibition of fi&s;h, milk, and ghee, for one month from the day of Inoculation; early on the morning &s;uc|ceeding the operation, four collons (an earthen pot containing about two gallons) of cold water are ordered to be thrown over the patient, from the head down|wards, and to be repeated every morning and evening until the fever comes on, (which u&s;ually is about the clo&s;e of the &s;ixth day from the Inoculation,) then to defi&s;t until the appearance of the erup|tions, (which commonly happens at the clo&s;e of the third complete day from the commencement of the fever,) and then to pur&s;ue the cold bathing as before, through the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and until the &s;cabs of the pu&s;tules drop off. They are ordered to open all the pu&s;tules with a fine &s;harp pointed thorn, as &s;oon as they begin to change their colour, and whil&s;t the matter continues in a fluid &s;tate. Con|finement to the hou&s;e is ab&s;olutely forbid, and the inoculated are ordered to be ex|po&s;ed to every air that blows; and the
<PB N="19" REF="21">utmo&s;t indulgence they are allowed when the fever comes on, is to be laid on a mat at the door; but, in fact, the eruptive fever is generally &s;o incon&s;iderable and trifling, as very &s;eldom to require this in|dulgence. Their regimen is ordered to con&s;i&s;t of all the refrigerating things the climate and &s;ea&s;on produces, as plantains, &s;ugar-canes, water-melons, rice, gruel made of white poppy-&s;eeds, and cold wa|ter, or thin rice gruel for their ordinary drink. The&s;e in&s;tructions being given, and an injunction laid on the patients to make a thank&s;giving <HI>Poojah,</HI> or Offering, to the Godde&s;s on their recovery, the Ope|rator takes his fee, which from the poor is a <HI>pund of cowries,</HI> equal to about a pen|ny &s;terling, and goes on to another door, down one &s;ide of the &s;treet and up on the other, and is thus employed from morning until night, inoculating &s;ometimes eight or ten in a hou&s;e. The regimen they or|der, when they are called to attend the di&s;|ea&s;e taken in the natural way, is uniform|ly the &s;ame. There u&s;ually begins to be a di&s;charge from the &s;carification a day be|fore
<PB N="20" REF="22">the eruption, which continues through the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes after the &s;cabs of the Pock fall off, and a few pu&s;tules generally appear round the edge of the wound; when the&s;e two circum&s;tances appear only, without a &s;ingle eruption on any other part of the body, the patient is deemed as &s;ecure from future infection, as if the eruption had been general.</P>
<P>When the before recited treatment of the Inoculated is &s;trictly followed, it is next to a miracle to hear, that one in a million fails of receiving the infection, or of one that mi&s;carries under it; of the multitudes I have &s;een inoculated in that country, the number of pu&s;tules have been &s;eldom le&s;s than fifty, and hardly ever ex|ceeded two hundred. Since, therefore, this practice of the Ea&s;t has been followed without variation, and with uniform &s;uc|ce&s;s from the remote&s;t known times, it is but ju&s;tice to conclude, it mu&s;t have been originally founded on the ba&s;is of rational principles and experiment.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="23">
<P>Although I was very early prejudiced in preference of the cool regimen and free admi&s;&s;ion of air, in the treatment of this di&s;ea&s;e, yet, on my arrival in Bengall, I thought the practice of the Bramins car|ried <HI>both</HI> to a bold, ra&s;h, and dangerous extreme; but a few years experience gave me full conviction of the propriety of their method: this influenced my practice, and the &s;ucce&s;s was adequate; and I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that every gentleman in the Profe&s;&s;ion who did not adopt the &s;ame mode, (making a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction and allowance between the con&s;titutions of the Natives and Europeans,) have lo&s;t many a patient, which might otherwi&s;e have been &s;aved; as I could prove in many in&s;tan|ces, where I have been called in too late to be of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But to form a judgment of the propriety of this Ea&s;tern practice with more preci&s;ion, it will be be&s;t to analyze it, from the period of the enjoined preparation, to the end of the proce&s;s; as thereby an opportunity pre|&s;ents it&s;elf of di&s;playing the principles on which the Bramins act, and by which
<PB N="22" REF="24">they ju&s;tify their &s;ingular method of prac|tice.</P>
<P>It has been already &s;aid, that the pre|parative cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ts only in ab&s;taining from fi&s;h, milk, and ghee; re&s;pecting the fir&s;t, it is known to be a vi&s;cid and inflammatory diet, tending to foul and ob&s;truct the cutaneous glands and excre|tory ducts, and to create in the &s;tomach and fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages a tough, &s;limy phlegm, highly injurious to the human con&s;titu|tion; as the&s;e are the generally &s;uppo&s;ed qualities of this diet, it &s;eems forbid upon the ju&s;te&s;t grounds.</P>
<P>Touching milk, which is the ba&s;is (next to rice) of all the natives food, I confe&s;s I was &s;urprized to find it one of the forbidden articles, until I was made ac|quainted with their rea&s;oning on the &s;ub|ject. They &s;ay that milk becomes highly nutritious, not only from its natural qua|lities, but principally from its ready admi&s;|&s;ion into the blood, and quick a&s;&s;imulation with it; and that it con&s;equently is a warm heating diet, and mu&s;t have a re|mote
<PB N="23" REF="25">tendency to inflammation, whenever the blood is thrown into any preternatural ferment, and therefore, that milk is a food highly improper, at a &s;ea&s;on when the pre|ternatural fermentation that produces the Small Pox ought to be feared, and guard|ed again&s;t by every per&s;on who knows him&s;elf liable to the di&s;ea&s;e, or determined to prepare him&s;elf for receiving it, either from nature or art. Upon this principle and rea&s;oning it is, that their women, during the cour&s;e of their periodical vi&s;itations, are &s;trictly forbid, and religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from, the u&s;e of milk, le&s;t it &s;hould, upon any accidental cold, di&s;po&s;e the uterus to inflammation and ulceration; and from the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion, the u&s;e of it is as &s;trictly prohibited during the flow of the lochia, and is avoided as &s;o much poi&s;on; our European women, re&s;ident in India, have adopted the &s;ame precaution from experience of the effect, and will not, on any con&s;ideration, at tho&s;e times, mix the &s;malle&s;t quantity with their tea, a le&s;|&s;on they derive from their Midwives, who are all natives, and generally are in&s;truct|ed
<PB N="24" REF="26">in their calling by the Bramins, and other Practitioners in Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Concerning the third interdicted article, they allege, that under <HI>that</HI> is implied a prohibition of all fat and oily &s;ub&s;tances, as their qualities are nearly &s;imilar with tho&s;e of fi&s;h, and &s;imilar in their effects of fouling the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in a high degree above any other aliment that is taken into them; that they &s;oon acquire an acrimony in the cour&s;e of dige&s;tion, and convey the &s;ame into the blood and juices; the&s;e pre|mi&s;es being granted, which I think can hardly be denied, there appears &s;ufficient cau&s;e for prohibiting the u&s;e of the whole tribe; the more e&s;pecially, as ghee and oil are the e&s;&s;ential ingredients u&s;ed in cooking their vegetable diet.</P>
<P>Thus far the &s;y&s;tem of practice pur&s;ued by the Bramins will, I imagine, appear rational enough, and well founded; but they have other rea&s;ons for particularly prohibiting the u&s;e of the&s;e three articles, which to &s;ome may appear purely &s;pecu|lative, if not chimerical. They lay it
<PB N="25" REF="27">down as a <HI>principle,</HI> that the <HI>immediate</HI> (or in&s;tant) cau&s;e of the Small Pox exi&s;ts in the mortal part of every human and <HI>ani|mal</HI> form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In an epidemic &s;ea&s;on of the confluent Small Pox, Turkeys, Chittygong Fowls, Madra&s;s Capons, and other poultry, are carried off by the di&s;ea&s;e in great numbers; and have the &s;ymptoms u&s;ually accompanying every &s;tage of the di&s;temper. I had a favourite Parrot that died of it in the year 1744; in him I had a fair opportunity of ob&s;erving the regular progre&s;s of the di&s;order; he &s;ickened, and had an ardent fever full two days before the eruption, and died on the &s;eventh day of the eruption; on opening him, we found his throat, &s;tomach, and whole channel of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, lined as thick with the pu&s;tules as the &s;urface of his body, where, for the mo&s;t part, they ro&s;e contiguous, but in other places they ran together.</NOTE>; that the <HI>mediate</HI> (or &s;econd) <HI>acting</HI> cau&s;e, which &s;tirs up the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and throws it into a &s;tate of fermentation, is multitudes of <HI>imperceptible animalculae</HI> floating in the atmo&s;phere; that the&s;e are the cau&s;e of all epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, but more particularly of the Small Pox; that they return at particular &s;ea&s;ons in greater or le&s;&s;er numbers; that the&s;e bodies, im|perceptible as they are to the human or|gans of vi&s;ion, impri&s;on the mo&s;t malig|nant tribes of the <HI>fallen angelic Spirits:</HI> That the&s;e animalculae touch and adhere to every thing, in greater or le&s;&s;er propor|tions, according to the nature of the &s;ur|faces which they encounter; that they
<PB N="26" REF="28">pa&s;s and repa&s;s in and out of the bodies of all animals in the act of re&s;piration, with|out injury to them&s;elves, or the bodies they pa&s;s through; that &s;uch is not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e that are taken in with the food, which, by ma&s;tication, and the di|ge&s;tive faculties of the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines, are cru&s;hed and a&s;&s;imulated with the chyle, and conveyed into the blood, where, in a certain time, their malignant juices excite a fermentation peculiar to the <HI>immediate</HI> (or <HI>in&s;tant</HI>) cau&s;e, which ends in an eruption on the &s;kin. That they adhere more clo&s;ely, and in greater numbers, to glutinous, fat, and oily &s;ub|&s;tances, by which they are in a manner taken pri&s;oners; that <HI>fi&s;h, milk,</HI> and <HI>ghee,</HI> have the&s;e qualities in a more eminent and dangerous degree, and attach the animalculae, and convey them in greater quantities into the blood; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons, added to tho&s;e before a&s;&s;igned, they are forbid to be taken in food dur|ing the preparative cour&s;e. They add, that the Small Pox is more or le&s;s epi|demical, more mild or malignant, in pro|portion as the air is charged with the&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="29">animalculae, and the quantity of them received with the food. That though we all receive, with our aliment, a por|tion of them, yet it is not always &s;uffi|cient in quantity to rai&s;e this peculiar fer|ment, and yet may be equal to &s;etting the &s;eeds of other di&s;ea&s;es in motion; hence the rea&s;on why any epidemical di&s;order &s;eldom appears alone. That when once this <HI>peculiar</HI> ferment, which produces the Small Pox, is rai&s;ed in the blood, the <HI>immediate (in&s;tant) cau&s;e</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e is totally expelled in the eruptions, or by other channels; and hence it is, that the blood is not &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;econd fer|mentation of the &s;ame kind. That Ino|culating for this di&s;ea&s;e was originally hinted by the <HI>Divinity</HI> pre&s;iding over the <HI>immediate (in&s;tant) cau&s;e,</HI> the thought be|ing much above the reach of human wi&s;|dom and fore&s;ight. That the great and obvious benefit accruing from it, con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the fermentation being ex|cited by the action of a &s;mall portion of matter (&s;imilar to the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e) which <HI>bad already pa&s;&s;ed through</HI> a &s;tate of fermentation, the effects mu&s;t be mo|derate
<PB N="28" REF="30">and benign; whereas the fermen|tation rai&s;ed by the malignant juices of the animalculae received into the blood with the aliment, gives nece&s;&s;arily addi|ditional force and &s;trength to the fir&s;t effi|cient cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>That noxious animalculae, floating in the atmo&s;phere, are the cau&s;e of all pe&s;tilential, and other epidemical di&s;or|ders, is a doctrine the Bramins are not &s;ingular in; however, &s;ome of the con|clu&s;ions drawn from it, are purely their own. A &s;peculative genius may amu&s;e it&s;elf by a&s;&s;igning this or that efficient cau&s;e, or fir&s;t principle of this di&s;ea&s;e; but the be&s;t conjecture which the wi&s;dom of man can frame, will appear vague and uncertain; nor is it of much mo|ment, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to puzzle the imagination, by a minute enquiry into the e&s;&s;ence of a cau&s;e hidden from us, when the effects are &s;o vi&s;ible, and chiefly call for our regard: but if we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign <HI>a cau&s;e,</HI> why every part of the globe, <HI>at particular &s;ea&s;ons,</HI> is more liable to pecu|liar malignant epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, than
<PB N="29" REF="31"><HI>at others,</HI> (which experience manife&s;ts) I &s;ee no one that &s;o much wears the com|plexion of probability, as that of pe&s;tilent animalculae, driven by &s;tated winds, or generated on the &s;pot by water and air in a &s;tate of &s;tagnation, (and con&s;equently in a &s;tate of putrefaction favourable to their propagation,) and received into the habit with our food and re&s;piration. We yearly &s;ee, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, the bane|ful effects of the&s;e in&s;ects in blights, al|though at their fir&s;t &s;eizure of a plant they are invi&s;ible, even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;t gla&s;&s;es; and I hope I &s;hall not be thought to refine too much on the ar|gument, if I give it as my opinion, that epidemical blights, and epidemical di&s;ea&s;es of one kind or other, may be ob&s;erved to go often hand in hand with each other, from the &s;ame identical cau&s;e. But to proceed in our analy&s;is.</P>
<P>The mode by which the Ea&s;tern Inocu|lators convey the variolous taint into the blood, has nothing uncommon in it, un|le&s;s we except the preceding friction upon the part intended for Inoculation, and moi&s;tening the &s;aturated pledget, before
<PB N="30" REF="32">the application of it; for this practice they alledge the following rea&s;ons; that by <HI>friction</HI> the circulation in the &s;mall &s;angui|nary ve&s;&s;els is accelerated, and the matter being <HI>diluted</HI> by a &s;mall portion of <HI>Ganges water,</HI> is, from both cau&s;es, more readily and eagerly received, and the operation at the &s;ame time &s;anctified. The friction and dilution of the matter, has certainly the &s;anc|tion of very good common &s;en&s;e; and the Ganges water, I doubt not, may have as much efficacy as any other <HI>holy water</HI> what&s;oever. This la&s;t circum&s;tance, how|ever, keeps up the piety and &s;olemnity with which the operation is conducted from the beginning to the end of it; it tends al&s;o to give confidence to the pa|tient, and &s;o far is very laudable. The rea&s;ons they a&s;&s;ign for giving the pre|ference to matter of the <HI>preceding year,</HI> are &s;ingular and judicious; they urge, it is more certain in its effects; that nece&s;|&s;ity fir&s;t pointed out the fact, (the vari|olous matter &s;ome years not being procu|rable,) and experience confirmed it: they add, that when the matter is effectually &s;ecured from the air, it undergoes at the
<PB N="31" REF="33">return of the &s;ea&s;on an <HI>imperceptible fer|mentation,</HI> which gives fre&s;h vigour to its action. It is no uncommon thing to ino|culate with matter four or five years old, but they generally prefer that of a year old, conceiving that the fermentation which con&s;titutes its &s;uperiority over fre&s;h matter, is yearly le&s;&s;ened, and con&s;equently the e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit of action weakened, after the fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>The next article of the Ea&s;tern prac|tice, which offers in the cour&s;e of our di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, is their &s;luicing their patients over head and ears, morning and evening, with cold water, until the fever comes on; in which the inoculating Bramins are, be|yond controver&s;y, &s;ingular: but before we can penetrate the grounds and rea&s;ons for this practice, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to be|&s;tow a few words on the u&s;ual manner of cold bathing in the Ea&s;t, when medically applied, which is &s;imply this; the water is taken up over night, in three, four, or five ve&s;&s;els, before de&s;cribed, (according to the &s;trength of the patient,) and left in the open air, to receive the dews of the night, which gives it an inten&s;e coldne&s;s;
<PB N="32" REF="34">then in the morning, before the &s;un ri&s;es, the water is poured without intermi&s;&s;ion, by two &s;ervants, over the body, from the di&s;tance of &s;ix or twelve inches above the head. This mode of cold bathing has been adopted from the Ea&s;tern profe&s;&s;ors of Phy&s;ic, by all the European practi|tioners, and by con&s;tant experience found abundantly more efficacious than that by immer&s;ion, in all ca&s;es where that very capital remedy was indicated; notwith|&s;tanding it has been ever the received opi|nion, that the &s;ucce&s;s of cold bathing, is as much, or rather more, owing to the weight and pre&s;&s;ure of the circumambient body of water, than <HI>the &s;hock.</HI> The re|markable &s;uperior efficacy of this Ea&s;tern method of cold bathing, can only be ac|counted for, from <HI>the &s;hock</HI> being infinite|ly greater, and of longer continuance, than that received by immer&s;ion; which is a fact indi&s;putable, as will be acknowledged by every one who goes through a cour&s;e of both methods; the &s;everity of the one being nothing comparable to the other: this I a&s;&s;ert from my own per&s;onal feel|ings; and I never had a patient that did
<PB N="33" REF="35">not aver the &s;ame, who had undergone both trials: indeed, the &s;hock of this Ea&s;tern method is &s;o great, that, in many ca&s;es, when the &s;ubject was deeply ex|hau&s;ted and relaxed, I have found it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to begin the cour&s;e only with <HI>a quart</HI> of water.</P>
<P>If the known effects of cold bathing are attended to, and its &s;overeign virtues duly con&s;idered, in the very different circum|&s;tances of Pal&s;ies, Rheumati&s;ms, general relaxation of the &s;olids, and particular re|laxation of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, we &s;hall not be long at a lo&s;s to account for this part of the Ea&s;tern practice in the cour&s;e of Inoculation: They allege in de|fence of it, that by the &s;udden &s;hock of the cold water, and con&s;equent increa&s;ed motion of the blood, all offen&s;ive princi|ples are forcibly driven from the heart, brain, and other interior parts of the body, towards the extremities and &s;urface, and at the &s;ame time the intended fermenta|tion is thereby more &s;peedily and certainly promoted; (hence it probably is, that the fever generally commences &s;o early as about the clo&s;e of the &s;ixth day.) When the fever
<PB N="34" REF="36">appears, they de&s;i&s;t from the u&s;e of the cold water, becau&s;e when the fermentation is once begun, the blood &s;hould not, they &s;ay, receive any additional commotion until the eruption appears, when they again re|&s;ume the cold water, and continue it to the end of the di&s;ea&s;e; a&s;&s;erting, that the u&s;e of it alone, by the daily fre&s;h <HI>impetus</HI> it gives to the blood, enables it utterly to expel and drive out the remainder of the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e into the pu&s;tules. I have been my&s;elf an eye-wit|ne&s;s to many in&s;tances of its marvelous effect, where the pu&s;tules have &s;unk, and the patient appeared in imminent danger, but almo&s;t in&s;tantly re&s;tored by the appli|cation of three or four collans of cold water, which never fails of filling the Pock, as it were by enchantment; and &s;o great is the &s;tre&s;s laid by the Ea&s;tern Practi|tioners on this preparative, (for as the three interdicted articles in food is preparative to the Inoculation, &s;o this may be deemed preparative to the eruption,) that when they are called in, and find, upon enquiry, that circum&s;tance (and opening the pu&s;tules)
<PB N="35" REF="37">has not been attended to, they refu&s;e any further attendance.</P>
<P>The next and la&s;t article of the Ea&s;tern practice, which falls under our con&s;idera|tion, is that ju&s;t abovementioned, viz. the opening of the Pu&s;tules, whil&s;t the matter continues in a fluid &s;tate. That a circum|&s;tance &s;o important, &s;o &s;elf-evidently ra|tional and e&s;&s;ential, &s;hould have been &s;o long unthought of, appears mo&s;t wonder|ful! and if my memory fails me not, HELVETIUS is the only writer upon the &s;ubject of the Small Pox, that hinted it in practice before Doctor TISSOT; this ac|curate and benevolent Phy&s;ician has en|forced it with &s;uch &s;trength of judgment and argument, that he leaves little room (except facts) to add to his pathetic per|&s;ua&s;ive; in this he is &s;upported by his learned and elegant Commentator and Tran&s;lator Doctor KIRKPATRICK, (page 226 and 227,) and I am not without hopes it will, contrary to Doctor TISSOT'S ex|pectation, "become a general practice;" the more e&s;pecially, when it is found to have invariable &s;ucce&s;s, and venerable an|tiquity, for its &s;anction.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="38">
<P>So great is the dependence which the Ea&s;tern Practitioners have on opening the Pu&s;tules, in every malignant kind of the di&s;ea&s;e, that where the fluid &s;tate of the matter has been &s;uffered to elap&s;e without being evacuated, they pronounce the i&s;&s;ue fatal, and it generally proves &s;o; they order it in every kind, even the mo&s;t di&s;tinct; for although in the&s;e it &s;hould &s;eem &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary, yet they conceive it effectually prevents inflammation and weakne&s;s of the eyes, biles, and other eruptions and di&s;orders, which &s;o com|monly &s;ucceed the di&s;ea&s;e, however be|nign; in very critical ca&s;es, they will not tru&s;t the operation of opening the Pu&s;tules to the nur&s;es or relations, but engage in it them&s;elves, with amazing patience and &s;olli|citude; and I have frequently known them thus employed for many hours together; and when it has been zealou&s;ly per&s;evered in, I hardly ever knew it fail, of either in|tirely preventing the <HI>&s;econd fever,</HI> or miti|gating it in &s;uch &s;ort, as to render it of no con&s;equence; in various in&s;tances, which I have been a witne&s;s to, in my own, and others practice, I have &s;een the
<PB N="37" REF="39">Pu&s;tules in the <HI>contiguous</HI> kind, upon being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively opened, fill again to the fourth and fifth, and in the <HI>confluent,</HI> to the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, and eighth time; in the very di&s;tinct &s;ort they will not fill again more than once or twice, and &s;ometimes not at all, which was a plain indication, that the whole virus of the di&s;ea&s;e was expelled in the fir&s;t eruption.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;tern Practitioners, with great mode&s;ty, arraign the European practice of Phlebotomy and Cathartics in any &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, but more particularly when de&s;igned to prevent, or mitigate the &s;econd fever; alledging, that the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> weakens the natural powers, and that the <HI>latter</HI> counter|acts the regular cour&s;e of <HI>nature,</HI> which in this di&s;ea&s;e invariably tends to throw out the offending cau&s;e <HI>upon the &s;kin;</HI> that &s;he often proves unequal to the intire expul|&s;ion of the enemy, in which ca&s;e, her wi&s;e purpo&s;es are to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, in that track, which &s;he her&s;elf points out, and not by a diver&s;ion of the u&s;ual cri&s;is into another chanel; that this a&s;&s;i&s;tance can only be attempted with propriety, by emptying the Pu&s;tules, as thereby fre&s;h room is
<PB N="38" REF="40">given in them for the reception of the cir|culating matter &s;till remaining in the blood, and which could not be contained in the fir&s;t eruption; by which means every end and purpo&s;e of averting, or &s;ub|duing the <HI>&s;econd fever</HI> is obtained, with a moral certainty; whil&s;t Phlebotomy and Cathartics, admini&s;tred with this view, are both irrational and precarious; as be|ing oppo&s;ite to the con&s;tant operation of Nature in her management of this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains only that I add a word or two upon the Ea&s;tern manner of opening the Pu&s;tules, which (as before mentioned) is directed to be done with a very fine &s;harp pointed thorn: Experience has e&s;tabli&s;hed the u&s;e of this natural in&s;trument in pre|ference to either the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, launcet, or needle; the Practitioners perforate the mo&s;t prominent part of the Pu&s;tule, and with the &s;ides of the thorn pre&s;s out the pus; and having opened about a dozen, they ab&s;orb the matter with a callico rag, dipt in warm water and milk; and proceed thus until the whole are di&s;charged: the orifice made by the thorn is &s;o extremely
<PB N="39" REF="41">&s;mall, that it clo&s;es immediately after the matter is pre&s;&s;ed out, &s;o that there is no admi&s;&s;ion of the external air into the Pu&s;tule, which would &s;uddenly contract the mouths of the excretory ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently the further &s;ecretion of the variolous matter from the blood would be thereby ob&s;tructed; for this con&s;ideration, the method recommended by Doctor TIS|SOT, of clipping the Pu&s;tules with &s;harp pointed &s;ci&s;&s;ars, is certainly liable to ob|jection, as the aperture would be too large; when in the true confluent kind, no di&s;tinct Pu&s;tules pre&s;ent, they perforate the mo&s;t prominent and promi&s;ing parts, in many places, at the di&s;tance of a tenth of an inch, u&s;ually beginning at the extremities; and I have often &s;een the Pu&s;tules in the <HI>con|tiguous,</HI> and the perforated parts in the <HI>confluent</HI> kind, fill again before the opera|tion has been half over; yet they do not repeat the opening until a few hours elap&s;e, conceiving it proper that the matter &s;hould receive &s;ome degree of concoction in the Pu&s;tules before it is again di&s;charged.</P>
<P>If the foregoing E&s;&s;ay on the Ea&s;tern mode of treating the Small Pox, throws
