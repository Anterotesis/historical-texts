<HEAD>REMARKABLE CASE OF A BOY.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the brain be not only the &s;eat of tho&s;e powers which di&s;tingui&s;h animate from inanimate matter, but al&s;o of all tho&s;e mental operations which dignify man above the inferior orders of animals, yet there is no part of the human body concern|ing which we po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o limited a knowledge. Its intricacy is great, and to that our igno|rance &s;eems to bear proportion. We neither know the manner in which it performs its functions, nor the &s;hare each of its parts have in their performance. The former is per|haps for wi&s;e purpo&s;es placed above human
<PB N="4" REF="3">under&s;tanding, and the latter, though it ap|pears more within our reach, has hitherto eluded the re&s;earch of enquirers. Perhaps with regard to it al&s;o we &s;hall always remain in the dark. Its different parts are &s;o inti|mately connected, that when one is affected, &s;o, in general, are the whole; and it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch delicacy of &s;tructure, and is &s;o im|mediately connected with the vital principle, that it cannot ea&s;ily be made the &s;ubject of experiment. Accidental injuries &s;eem to bid faire&s;t towards its elucidation; but even the&s;e, as a &s;ource of information, mu&s;t be regarded as exceedingly uncertain. Some times, when to appearance &s;mall, their effects have been almo&s;t in&s;tantly fatal, while at other times, when &s;eemingly of much greater importance, they have been productive of little &s;ub&s;equent harm. Of the latter kind, the following ca&s;e of William Stewart, in the pari&s;h of Kip|pen, and &s;hire of Perth, affords a mo&s;t re|markable in&s;tance, the detail of which, if it
<PB N="5" REF="4">can in the lea&s;t conduce to illu&s;trate a &s;ub|ject &s;o curious and intere&s;ting, will afford much plea&s;ure to the per&s;on within who&s;e ob&s;ervation it fell. This at lea&s;t he thinks it points out, that every part of the brain is not equally concerned in the execution of its functions; but being little acquainted with this &s;ubject, he neither pretends to trace cau&s;es, nor to draw conclu&s;ions. Whatever inferences it may &s;ugge&s;t, he leaves to be deduced by tho&s;e more ver&s;ed in phy&s;iology. He only aims at an accurate &s;tatement of facts, which, from a regular journal he kept during the progre&s;s of the cure, he hopes he &s;hall be able to give, and, if in this he &s;hall &s;ucceed, the &s;ingularity of the ca&s;e will, he hopes, of it&s;elf, entitle it to attention.</P>
<P>The patient is a &s;ervant boy, about 14 years of age, and met with the accident on the 1&s;t of July la&s;t, in con&s;equence of a blow from the foot of a hor&s;e, which knocked him to the ground, and left him in a &s;tate of in&s;en|&s;ibility.
<PB N="6" REF="5">He remained alone nearly two hours, and was then accidentally di&s;covered by a per|&s;on of the &s;ame family, who, being &s;trictly interrogated concerning the condition in which he found him, and what happened before the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e were examined in|to, related, <Q>"That his face, and the ground underneath, were covered with blood, which &s;till continued to i&s;&s;ue in con&s;iderable quan|tity, from a wound on the right &s;ide of his forehead: That, from the &s;ame wound, a whiti&s;h, or rather greyi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, of a &s;oft and pulpy con&s;i&s;tence, and of nearly the &s;ize of a hen's egg, was di&s;charged, but that no pieces of bone were ob&s;erved along with it: That he was &s;en&s;ible, (which, from the boy's own account, he became &s;oon after the ac|cident), but was &s;o weak, that he could not ri&s;e: That, upon rai&s;ing him from the ground, he fell into a &s;woon, (perhaps from the erect po&s;ture), and continued in it till brought home, and laid in bed: That his recovery
<PB N="7" REF="6" MS="y">from this was attended with &s;everal efforts to vomit, which occa&s;ioned the di&s;charge of a|bout half the quantity of the &s;ame greyi&s;h coloured &s;ub&s;tance, as formerly, from the wound; but that, from this time, till he fell within the writer's own ob&s;ervation, in about an hour thereafter, nothing remark|able took place."</Q> The la&s;t portion of the greyi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance di&s;charged from the wound, being pre&s;erved for the purpo&s;e of examina|tion, was now found to con&s;i&s;t of brain, prin|cipally cortical, but that al&s;o intermixed with &s;triae of medullary &s;ub&s;tance. The former was left on the field where the injury was &s;u&s;tained, but from the exact &s;imilarity ob|&s;erved by the per&s;on who di&s;covered the pa|tient, mu&s;t have been of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>When the wound, which was ragged and unequal, was laid open, the &s;ub&s;tance of the brain projected a little way from its &s;ur|face,
<PB N="8" REF="7">which being wiped off, expo&s;ed to view an orifice in the bone, extending from a con|&s;iderable way above the external corner of the right eye-brow upwards, and backwards to|ward the coronal future. That this might be examined with accuracy, the integuments were more freely divided through its whole extent, and its dimen&s;ions thereby a&s;certained to be in breadth at the middle part about an inch, and in length rather more than two inches, with its &s;ides gradually converging together, &s;o as to form an acute angle at each extremi|ty. From its edges fi&s;&s;ures ran in almo&s;t all directions, and one piece of bone, about the &s;ize of a &s;ixpence, on its upper &s;ide, was &s;o nearly detached, that it could have been re|moved by the finger; but being no ways de|pre&s;&s;ed, was left remaining. That portion, the &s;eparation of which occa&s;ioned the hole, was in all probability either beat out by the hor&s;e's foot, or left &s;o loo&s;e as to be carried away by the fir&s;t portion of brain di&s;charged,
<PB N="9" REF="8">as no pieces of it could be detected, though &s;ought after with all po&s;&s;ible attention. The dura mater appeared on all &s;ides torn and ragged, and the heaving and falling of the brain underneath, were &s;o great during exa|mination, from the full in&s;pirations and expi|rations occa&s;ioned by his cries, that at one time &s;ome of it was pu&s;hed out through the wound, while at another it receded &s;o far from the bone, that a void &s;pace was left, in|to which the finger could for a good way ea&s;ily have been in&s;inuated. The protruded parts were &s;o torn by the &s;harp and ragged edges of the bone, that at different times more than the &s;ize of a hazle nut required to be wiped off; and this appeared to con&s;i&s;t prin|cipally of medullary &s;ub&s;tance, or, at lea&s;t, contained now a much &s;maller intermixture of cortical than that formerly di&s;charged.</P>
<P>It being by a careful &s;earch made pretty evident, that no pieces of bone were &s;o &s;itua|ted, as to be productive of any future injury
<PB N="10" REF="9">to the parts below, either by compre&s;&s;ion or irritation, the integuments were brought to|gether, and &s;ecured near the upper extremity of the wound with a &s;uture. This was done, to prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible the acce&s;s of air, while more was thought improper, for fear of ob&s;tructing the egre&s;s of matter, which apparently would be great, and which, if in any way confined, might occa&s;ion very per|nicious effects. The wound was covered with lint, and all &s;ecured with a bandage; and in order that the lower extremity of the wound might be made as depending as po&s;|&s;ible, he was laid to re&s;t, with his head pret|ty much elevated in bed.</P>
<P>The patient's pul&s;e, which before the exa|mination of the wound, was 120, in about half an hour after it, had ri&s;en in frequency to 160, and was &s;o weak as hardly to be counted. His re&s;piration was very anxious, and he felt very feeble and languid. On being rai&s;ed erect, he had a tendency to deli|quium.
<PB N="11" REF="10">A clammy moi&s;ture was pre&s;ent on his &s;kin, and he had frequent &s;tarting of the mu&s;cles of his extremities.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance here was unfavourable, and &s;eemed to forebode approaching di&s;&s;olu|tion; but a de&s;ire to know the i&s;&s;ue of &s;o re|markable an accident made it appear improper to de&s;ert the patient till the fatal event had ac|tually taken place. This, with another con&s;ide|ration of equal importance, namely, that of the boy's low &s;ituation in life, excluding him from proper medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not the &s;anguine expectation of performing a cure, were the motives which induced the writer to under|take its management; and this he did, though he had been hitherto more engaged in the &s;tudy than in the practice of his profe&s;&s;ion. He regulated the medical treatment, entirely by the &s;ymptoms which pre&s;ented them&s;elves, thinking it more expedient carefully to watch the efforts of nature, and implicitly to follow her indications, than by too active an interfe|rence
<PB N="12" REF="11">upon the rules of method and &s;y|&s;tem, probably to counteract her operations. This plan was adopted the more readily, as it coincided exactly with the &s;entiments of Mr Campbell, a very intelligent &s;urgeon at Balfron, who was pre&s;ent at the examination and dre&s;&s;ing of the wound; and it afterwards gave much &s;atisfaction to hear it approved of by Dr Leckie of Broich, a gentleman who has had an exten&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful practice, both here and in the We&s;t Indies, for many years, who &s;aw the patient during the progre&s;s of the cure.</P>
<P>As the &s;ymptom which required mo&s;t to be counteracted, &s;eemed debility, the patient was ordered a drink moderately cordial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whi&s;ky toddy.</NOTE>, and this appeared to take effect &s;o far, that next day his pul&s;e had de&s;cended to 120, and had now a much fuller and firmer beat than the preceding evening. The &s;tarting of the mu&s;cles was quite gone; the &s;en&s;ation of lan|gour was much dimini&s;hed, and he breathed
<PB N="13" REF="12">with con&s;iderable freedom; but the &s;ymptoms of debility were again aggravated by a &s;light hoemorrhagy from the wound, which, during the fir&s;t two days, took place repeatedly. On this account, the &s;ame cordial was continued, and had &s;eemingly the &s;ame good effects. Afterwards, however, the pul&s;e gradually ro&s;e in &s;trength, and the other &s;ymptoms of fever &s;upervened which required the di&s;continua|tion of this and the pur&s;uit of another very different plan. The antiphlogi&s;tic regimen, in all its branches, was &s;trictly enjoined. All impre&s;&s;ions from &s;ound, from light, and from heat were carefully avoided, &s;o likewi&s;e what|ever could call the attention, or in any way excite to action any of the internal faculties. Indeed all this &s;eemed &s;trongly pointed out by nature her&s;elf, an over &s;en&s;ibility to every impre&s;&s;ion appearing a very urgent &s;ymptom. Sleep was awanting; but &s;upervening inflam|mation, &s;eemed to forbid opiates. The thir&s;t too was great, but was as much as po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="14" REF="13">guarded again&s;t by acidulated drink. The only medicines admini&s;tered were refrige|rants and cooling laxatives; by the former, if po&s;&s;ible, to moderate the violence of circu|lation; and by the latter, not only to produce the &s;ame effect, but al&s;o to obviate any irrita|tion from an improper &s;tate of the alimenta|ry canal. On the fourth and fifth days, he was at times delirious, with his pul&s;e above 100; great heat of &s;kin, thir&s;t and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, blood-letting was on the point of being u&s;ed; but a general &s;weat upon the morning of the &s;ixth day, mo|derated all the &s;ymptoms, and made it after|wards unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the wound was very painful. The di&s;charge of blood mentioned took place from its edges, on the two fir&s;t days, but from that till the fourth, its edges were rather dry; when by the help of emol|lient applications, it began to di&s;charge copi|ou&s;ly; at fir&s;t a matter thin, and intolerably
<PB N="15" REF="14">foetid, but about the ninth day became chan|ged into a laudable pus. About that time al&s;o, &s;mall ma&s;&s;es, &s;eemingly brain, in a dead and corrupted &s;tate, con&s;tituted a part of the di&s;|charge, the egre&s;s of which was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the depending po&s;ition in which the wound was always kept.</P>
<P>After the &s;ixth day, the &s;ymptoms of fever began to di&s;appear. His tongue, which was before white, and furred, gradually became clean. The heat of his &s;kin, and thir&s;t, total|ly went off, and his pul&s;e from 100, de&s;cend|ed fir&s;t to the natural &s;tandard, and afterwards &s;unk &s;o low, as for a number of days, not much to exceed 60. It &s;unk however in frequency, not in &s;trength. With this his &s;en&s;ibility al&s;o dimini&s;hed, but could never be perceived to be below its natural &s;tate. His &s;leep was now &s;ound, abundant, and refre&s;h|ing, and his appetite began to recover. His urine, which was red, and in &s;mall quantity, was now more copious, and depo&s;ited a large
<PB N="16" REF="15">browni&s;h &s;ediment. He had &s;till tran&s;itory headach, but except of this, and general weakne&s;s, from the 11th day onwards, he made little or no complaint.</P>
<P>The di&s;charge was at this time great, but con&s;i&s;ted of matter that was well formed. The edges of the wound looked clean, and granu|lations began to &s;prout out all around. No adhe&s;ion was the con&s;equence of the future; but as the orifice in the integuments was ra|ther &s;uperior to that in the bone, that in the latter was thereby kept pretty well covered. The motion of the brain &s;eemed now to be &s;ynchronous with the action of the heart and arteries, and not with re&s;piration. This in|deed was the ca&s;e from the beginning, except when the latter was increa&s;ed by preternatu|ral cau&s;es. The edges of the wound were daily covered with &s;lips of linen, &s;pread with common cerate, and lint was laid over its mid|dle part, to ab&s;orb any matter di&s;charged. A|bout the 18th day the di&s;charge &s;eemed to di|mini&s;h,
<PB N="17" REF="16">and the integuments had fallen con&s;i|derably inwards, thereby forming a hollow. The former of the&s;e circum&s;tances aro&s;e ap|parently from the matter not getting free ex|it, in con&s;equence of partial adhe&s;ions having formed underneath. This gave con&s;iderable irritation, which for a &s;hort time cau&s;ed head|ach, quickne&s;s of pul&s;e, and a &s;light return of fever. But the&s;e &s;ymptoms were prevented from running high, by the introduction of a probe below the integuments, by which they were gradually rai&s;ed, and free exit given to matter which had accumulated in con&s;iderable quantity.</P>
<P>From this time he felt him&s;elf &s;o well, as to have an inclination to get out of bed, and be|ing permitted, he ro&s;e at fir&s;t for a &s;hort &s;pace only, but increa&s;ed it by degrees. He was now al&s;o allowed to take more nutritive diet than for &s;ome time he had been permitted to do, which was thought the more nece&s;&s;ary as the di&s;charge was great, and as night &s;weats,
<PB N="18" REF="17">and the other &s;ymptoms of hectic fever ap|peared in a &s;light degree to &s;upervene; but the&s;e were in this manner obviated.</P>
<P>The di&s;charge now dimini&s;hed apace, and the wound gradually filled up, &s;o that at the end of the month, it was almo&s;t well. Only a &s;mall portion of it remained open, which in little more than a week afterwards, was com|pletely cicatrized. The part was &s;till con&s;i|derably hollow, and to all appearance will re|main permanently &s;o, it being hitherto little filled. At that time its bottom felt &s;oft and yielding; wherefore to prevent the chance of its &s;u&s;taining any injury from accidental cau|&s;es, a piece of pa&s;te-board lined with flannel, was thought proper to cover all that &s;ide of the forehead.&mdash;He was now &s;ent home to his friends, who lived farther north in the coun|try, with &s;trict injunctions to avoid exerci&s;e. Indeed that he might the more conveniently do &s;o, was the principal rea&s;on for &s;ending him thither; and its propriety was evident from
<PB N="19" REF="18">this, that its u&s;e always gave him pain on the &s;ide of the head affected.</P>
<P>On the 10th of September, an opportunity having offered of examining him, it was found, that the pa&s;te-board was laid a&s;ide, and the orifice which had been in the bone, &s;eemed completely o&s;&s;ified in its whole ex|tent. The bottom of the hollow part, felt hard, and made a re&s;i&s;tance when pre&s;&s;ed up|on that could only be done by bone. His general health was now complete, and had been &s;o &s;ince he was &s;ent to his friends. In &s;hort, he &s;aid, that he never enjoyed more perfect health. Every function, both mental and corporeal, was unimpaired, and indeed had always been &s;o &s;ince the accident, except the &s;hort time he was delirious. His external &s;en&s;es were all entire, and his internal facul|ties, &s;o far as could be di&s;tingui&s;hed either by his relations, or by others who have &s;een him, have not &s;uffered the &s;malle&s;t diminution of acutene&s;s. He &s;eems naturally to po&s;&s;e&s;s great
<PB N="20" REF="19">vivacity, and quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which to all appearance will continue. At lea&s;t &s;o far as yet appears, no alteration in the&s;e, or any other endowment, will be the con&s;e|quence of the pre&s;ent accident.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI>&mdash;Since the above was written, the patient has been examined frequently, and is found to enjoy health, &s;trength, and the exerci&s;e of all his functions, entirely as before the accident. A circum&s;tance of &s;ome cu|rio&s;ity which he has repeatedly mentioned, is, that &s;ince his recovery he has been quite free from an occa&s;ional headach, with which he was formerly much troubled.</P>
