<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE AETHER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THIS truly extraordinary Chemical Pre|paration is not a new Di&s;covery, having been known and e&s;teemed, as a valuable Curio&s;ity, by many of the greate&s;t Che|mi&s;ts and Philo&s;ophers, both Ancient and Modern; particularly by Sir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quere 31&s;t, at the End of his Optics.</NOTE> <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> and the Honourable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Produciblene&s;s of Chemical Principles.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> who both mention it in their Works, tho' not by this Name: And therefore be|fore any Thing is &s;aid of it's Virtues as a Medicine, it may not be improper to explain the Nature of it, and enumerate a few of it's remarkable Properties, con&s;ider|ed as a Curio&s;ity in Chemi&s;try, in which Light chiefly it has hitherto been view'd by tho&s;e who have been acquainted with it.</P>
<P>IT is a kind of ETHEREAL OIL, produced by the Decompo&s;ition of the Vinous Spirit by Means of the Vitriolic Acid, and differs e&s;&s;entially both from Vinous Spirits and E&s;&s;ential Oils in &s;everal Re&s;pects, tho' it agrees with them in &s;ome, as will appear hereafter: But as the Vinous Spirit may be decompo&s;ed by means of all the three Mineral Acids, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Vitriolic,</HI> the
<PB N="4" REF="4"><HI>Nitrous</HI> and the <HI>Marine,</HI> and as the&s;e all act differently on the Spirit, they will, of Cour&s;e, produce three dif|ferent Kinds of AETHER; which, from the Name of the Acid employ'd in making them, are term'd <HI>Ma|rine, Nitrous,</HI> or <HI>Vitriolic:</HI> The la&s;t only is the Kind here under&s;tood, it's Properties being more &s;ingular and extraordinary, and, as an AETHER, more perfect than either of the others; the Rea&s;on of which &s;eems to be, that the <HI>Vitriolic Acid</HI> is a much &s;tronger Agent on the Spirit, and more perfectly decompo&s;es it, than either the <HI>Nitrous</HI> or <HI>Marine.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the mo&s;t light, mo&s;t volatile, and mo&s;t in|flammable, of all known Liquids: It &s;wims upon the highe&s;t rectified Spirit of Wine as Oil does upon Wa|ter, and flies away &s;o quickly as hardly to wet a Hand it is dropped upon; from which Properties it probably has obtained it's Name. It is &s;o readily inflammable, as to take Fire at the approach of a Candle, before the Flame touches it. Any Electrified Body will al&s;o pro|duce the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P>IT is one of the mo&s;t powerful Solvents known in Che|mi&s;try: It is neither <HI>acid</HI> nor <HI>alcaline,</HI> and therefore is perfectly free from that faline Acrimony with which all the common Volatile Spirits abound: It has a greater Affinity with Gold than <HI>Aqua Regia</HI> has, altho' it will not di&s;&s;olve it in the Ma&s;s, or whil&s;t in it's Metallic Form; but if you add AETHER to a &s;olution of Gold in Aqua Regia, it pre&s;ently takes all the Gold from it's former Solvent, keeping it perfectly di&s;&s;ol|ved and &s;u&s;pended, without the lea&s;t Precipitation; and becomes of a yellow Colour: The AETHER, thus &s;aturated with the Gold, does not mix with the Aqua Regia, but may readily be &s;eparated from it by &s;imple Decantation, and thus a true and &s;afe <HI>Aurum
<PB N="5" REF="5">potabile</HI> is readily prepared for tho&s;e who want &s;uch a Medicine. The Union of the&s;e two Sub&s;tances is very remarkable, one being the heavie&s;t &s;olid Body we know, and the other the lighte&s;t Liquid.</P>
<P>THE AETHER is remarkably cold, when dropped upon the Hand, and it affects the Thermometer in an extraordinary Manner; for if the Ball of either a Mer|curial or Spirituous Thermometer be immer&s;ed in it, the Spirit or Mercury immediately &s;inks con&s;iderably, tho' both the AETHER and the Thermometer have &s;tood a &s;ufficient Time together to be brought to the temperature of the Room, before the Experiment was made. The Thermometers dipt into Water, or Spirit of Wine, in the &s;ame Manner, &s;uffer not the lea&s;t Al|teration.</P>
<P>THEY who chu&s;e to &s;ee a further Account of the &s;ingular Effects which this curious Fluid produces, may peru&s;e what Doctor <HI>Frobenius,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> Chemi&s;t, has publi&s;hed concerning it, in the Philo&s;ophic Tran&s;actions for the Years 1733 and 1741.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t valuable Qualities of the AETHER are it's <HI>medicinal</HI> ones; it having been found by repeat|ed Experience to be an excellent Remedy in mo&s;t <HI>ner|vous Di&s;ea&s;es;</HI> particularly in FITS of all &s;orts, whether <HI>Epileptic, Convul&s;ive, Hy&s;teric, Hypochondriac,</HI> or <HI>Para|lytic:</HI> In habitual HEAD-ACHES, GOUT, RHEUMA|TISM, PAINS IN THE STOMACH, WINDY DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES, HOOPING COUGH, ASTHMA, PLEURITIC PAINS, and DEAFNFSS; all which Di&s;ea&s;es have, in a &s;ingular Manner, been removed by it; and that the Publi&s;her may contribute all the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance he can in extending the u&s;e of this Medicine, the following Methods of applying it are given, which have been attended with Succe&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Particular Directions for u&s;ing the <HI>AETHER. In the HEAD-ACH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A FIT of the Head-ach is almo&s;t in&s;tantly removed by applying the AETHER externally to the Fore|head, by means of a bit of Linen Rag, in the Manner hereafter directed for it's external Application. Or it may be applied to any other Part of the Head where the Pain lies, being fir&s;t &s;haved, if nece&s;&s;ary. If the Pain is violent, a Do&s;e of it &s;hould be al&s;o taken in|wardly. In &s;tubborn Ca&s;es it will likewi&s;e be &s;ervice|able to &s;nuff a little of the AETHER up the No&s;trils, either alone or mixed with equal Parts of Lavender Water, <HI>Hungary</HI> Water, or Brandy; or it may be more convenient to apply a bit of Linen Rag, wetted with AETHER, up the No&s;trils. Any of the&s;e Means, or all of them, mu&s;t be repeated if the Pain is &s;o ur|gent as to require it. To cure this Di&s;order radically, when it is of long &s;tanding, and to prevent it's Re|turn, the Medicine mu&s;t be taken inwardly for a con|&s;iderable Time every Night at Bed-time, or in violent Ca&s;es, every Night and Morning, in a &s;mall Draught of cold Water, according to the General Direction for taking it inwardly, given p. 11. In &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, Vomits are very &s;erviceable.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A VERTIGO.</HEAD>
<P>A VERTIGO, Giddine&s;s, or Swimming in the Head, will generally be removed by proceeding in the &s;am Manner as for the Head-ach.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The EPILEPSY.</HEAD>
<P>No Di&s;ea&s;e is more difficult to cure than the Epi|lep&s;y or Falling-Sickne&s;s; yet &s;everal In&s;tances have
<PB N="7" REF="7">occurred where the mo&s;t violent Degrees of it have been cured, even in grown Per&s;ons, by taking a Do&s;e of this Medicine regulary every Night and Morning for a con|&s;iderable Time. The Do&s;e mu&s;t be regulated accord|ing to the Age of the Patient, as mentioned in the General Direction, Page 11. If a Pain is felt in any Part of the Head, the AETHER mu&s;t be ap|plied to that Part occa&s;ionally, and it mu&s;t be previou&s;|ly &s;haved, if nece&s;&s;ary. It will be proper to give a &s;mall Do&s;e of <HI>Tinctura Sacra,</HI> or of the <HI>Pill. Rufi,</HI> at proper Intervals, as once a Week or Fortnight. It will al&s;o, in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, be nece&s;&s;ary to give now and then a Vomit. If it be &s;u&s;pected that the Patient has Worms, proper Medicines to de&s;troy them ought al&s;o to be given.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>In CONVULSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN Convul&s;ions, or Convul&s;ive Di&s;orders, give the AETHER inwardly, a Do&s;e two three Times a Day, or oftener, according to the exigence of the Ca&s;e; and it &s;hould al&s;o be applied externally to the Fore|head, or any other Part of the Head, during the Fit. If the Patient is full of Blood, bleeding is nece&s;&s;ary, and if Co&s;tive, a Do&s;e of <HI>Manna, Senna,</HI> or any gentle Lax|ative, or a Cly&s;ter, &s;hould be given.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Hy&s;teric and Hypochondriac DISORDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Medicine has excellent Effect in <HI>Hy&s;teric Fits,</HI> and in all that Train of Symptoms which Hy&s;teric and Hypochondriac Per&s;ons are &s;ubject to; &s;uch as Ri&s;ings in the Throat threatning Suffocation, difficult Breathing, Flutterings and Palpitations of the Heart, frequent Fainting, Lowne&s;s of Spirits, violent Pains in the Head, Languor of the whole Body, Dullne&s;s of the
<PB N="8" REF="8">Mind and Sen&s;es, with con&s;tant Anxieties and Inqui|etude, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Do&s;e mu&s;t be repeated according to the urgency of the Symptoms; and the Medicine mu&s;t be continued &s;ome Time after the Complaints di&s;ap|pear, to prevent a Relap&s;e. It will be &s;erviceable du|ring the U&s;e of the AETHER, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;e of Co&s;tivene&s;s, to take at proper Intervals a gentle Purge, &s;uch as <HI>Tinctura Sacra, Pill. Rufi, Rhubarb,</HI> or <HI>Glau|ber's Salts.</HI> Bodily Exerci&s;e of all &s;orts contributes greatly to the Cure of the&s;e Complaints, e&s;pecially Ri|ding on Hor&s;eback.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PALSY.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>Pal&s;ies,</HI> and all Paralytic Complaints, the Patient, if a grown Per&s;on, mu&s;t take the quantity of a Tea Spoonful of the AETHER every Night and Morning. The Do&s;e mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened in young People, according to their Age. It will al&s;o be proper to &s;nuff a little of it up the No&s;trils once or twice a Day, or apply a bit of Rag wetted with it up the No&s;trils. The AETHER mu&s;t al&s;o be applied externally to the Part affected, at lea&s;t once every Day. It &s;hould likewi&s;e be applied now and then to the Forehead, or any other part of the Head, e&s;pecially if the Tongue, Eyes, or any part of the Face or Head be affected. If the Arms or Hands are Paralytic, the Application &s;hould be made to the low|er and back Part of the Neck, as well as to the Part af|fected. If the Di&s;ea&s;e has &s;eiz'd the Thighs, Legs, or Feet, the Application mu&s;t not only be made to them, but likewi&s;e to the Back Bone, at the Loins. As this Medicine cannot, on account of it's Volatility and Pun|gency, be properly applied to the Whole of a Paraly|tic Limb at once, but only to a &s;mall Part of it, the Application therefore may be made &s;ometimes to one
<PB N="9" REF="9">Part, and &s;ometimes to another, as &s;hall be thought proper.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e will require a longer or &s;horter Continu|ance of the&s;e Means, according to the Degree of it, and the Time it has continued. A Vomit &s;hould be given, and repeated now and then as the Patient can bear it; but if Vomits &s;eem too fatiguing, a Do&s;e of <HI>Tinctura Sacra</HI> may be given in their room. Paralytic Patients &s;hould u&s;e as much Bodily Exerci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and the Head, Neck, and the whole Spine, as well as the Parts affected, &s;hould be frequently rubbed with a hot and dry Cloth till they appear red.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Medicine is of &s;ingular Service in the <HI>Gout,</HI> not only while it continues in the Limbs, but particularly when it flies inwards, and attacks the Head, Stomach, or any of the internal Parts; in which Ca&s;es a few Do&s;es will not fail to give pre&s;ent Relief. It &s;hould be taken in the Quantity of a Tea Spoonful, two or three Times every Day, or oftener, if the Ca&s;e be violent, during the Gou|ty Fit. It carries off the Gouty Matter by Urine, which it renders very thick and turbid. At any Time when there is a Nece&s;&s;ity to abate the exce&s;&s;ive Pain in the Part affected, the AETHER may be applied to it externally, according to the Method given p. 12. It will be proper to continue taking the AETHER once or twice a Day for &s;ome Time after the Fit is gone, and to begin taking it again about the Time of it's expected Return; by which Means, tho' it may not prevent the Return of the Fit, which in many Ca&s;es perhaps ought not to be de&s;ired, yet it will &s;horten it's Continuance, and moderate the Pain of it.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HEAD>RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>IN Rheumatic Complaints the Patient mu&s;t take a Do&s;e of this Medicine every Night and Morning, or oftener, if the Pains are violent; and it mu&s;t be conti|nued till the Di&s;ea&s;e is removed, or longer, to prevent a Relap&s;e. If the Pain is fixed in any particular Part, the AETHER mu&s;t be applied to it twice a Day, as directed hereafter. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> very much conduces to the Cure of ob&s;tinate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ic Rheumati&s;ms, and mu&s;t be repeated at proper Intervals if nece&s;&s;ary; the Blood in this Di&s;ea&s;e being generally very &s;izy.</P>

<HEAD>Di&s;orders of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Inte&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Medicine pre&s;ently cures Flatulent Cholics, removes all Windy Di&s;orders of the Stomach and In|te&s;tines, and corrects Acidities lodged there. It is al&s;o found to have excellent Effect in correcting that Weak|ne&s;s, or bad Habit of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, which &s;tudious Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as lead &s;edentary Lives, are particularly &s;ubject to, and is attended with four Belchings, Heart-burn, Windy Di&s;ten&s;ions, Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Stomach and Bowels. It mu&s;t be taken every Night and Morning, according to the General Direction below. Care &s;hould be taken to prevent Co&s;tivene&s;s in the&s;e Ca&s;es, which is be&s;t remo|ved by chewing <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> or taking it any other way, or by a Do&s;e of <HI>Manna,</HI> or <HI>Glauber's Salts,</HI> taken oc|ca&s;ionally.</P>
<P>THE AETHER is an extraordinary Diuretic in DROPSIES: It is an excellent Medicine in an ASTHMA, and the HICCUP; and may be looked upon as a Spe|cific in that Di&s;ea&s;e of Children called the HOOPING-COUGH, or CHIN-COUGH; in all which Ca&s;es it mu&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="11">be taken inwardly, according to the General Directi|on below, and the repetition of the Do&s;e mu&s;t be regu|lated by the violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A DOSE of it taken at going to Bed, after Drink|ing too freely, has been found to prevent the Head|ach, Sickne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which u&s;ually follow next Morning.</P>
<P>IT has removed DEAFNESS, and Hardne&s;s of Hear|ing, by moi&s;tening a little Cotton with a few Drops of it, putting it into the Ear, and holding the Finger for a few Minutes over it, at the &s;ame Time &s;nuffing a few Drops of it, mixed with Spirit of Lavender, up the No&s;trils, or putting a bit of Rag wet with the AETHER alone up the No&s;trils.</P>
<P>IT has frequently removed a temporary DIMNESS OF SIGHT, attended with a Swimming or Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Head, by external Application to the Forehead; and is a promi&s;ing Medicine in that Sort of Blindne&s;s called a GUTTA SERENA, and in Beginning CATA|RACTS, in which Ca&s;es it &s;hould be taken inwardly, as well as applied to the Forehead, and up the No&s;trils.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e found to be of great Service in remo|ving PLEURITIC PAINS, and STITCHES in the Side, by applying it to the affected Part, in the Manner di|rected for external Application.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Method of taking the <HI>AETHER</HI> Inwardly.</HEAD>
<P>THE General Do&s;e for a grown Per&s;on is a common Tea Spoonful; and the be&s;t Vehicle to take it in is a &s;mall Draught of Cold Water. If it be only &s;tirred in the Water with the Spoon, and the Mixture drank immediately it &s;trikes the No&s;trils by it's Volatility, but may be thought by &s;ome as agreeable when &s;o taken as when the two Liquors are more in|timately mixed, by &s;haking them together in a Phial,
<PB N="12" REF="12">and from thence pouring them into a Gla&s;s to be drank; for tho' it has but little Smell in this Manner, it is more warm to the Palate than in the other. The Patient may u&s;e the Way of Mixing he likes be&s;t, and if he has any Objection to Water, may take it in any other agreeable cold Liquor. Children in the Month may take two or three Drops for a Do&s;e; tho&s;e of a Year old may take &s;even or eight Drops; tho&s;e of five or &s;ix Years old may take from twenty to twenty-five Drops, and &s;o encrea&s;ing according to their Years: Or it may perhaps be better, in giving it to Children, to mix a Tea Spoonful of AETHER, with a convenient Quantity of Water, and, &s;haking it well, give at a Do&s;e about one twentieth Part of this Mixture to a Child a Month old; about one eighth Part to a Child twelve or fourteen Months old; to tho&s;e about five Years old one third Part of the Mixture; half of the Mixture to tho&s;e about &s;even Years old, and two thirds of it to tho&s;e about fourteen Years old.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Method of applying the <HI>AETHER</HI> Externally.</HEAD>
<P>To apply it Externally, you mu&s;t procure a Bit of Linen Rag, of &s;uch a Dimen&s;ion as to be conveniently covered by the Palm of the Hand; moi&s;ten this Rag with a little of the AETHER as it lies upon your Palm, and in&s;tantly apply it to the Part affected, pre&s;|&s;ing it very clo&s;e, &s;o as to prevent the E&s;cape of it's Fumes, for two or three Minutes, in which Time the Rag will be found dry, and may be taken away. It will be more convenient, on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, (as in applying it to Paralytic Parts, Rheumatic Pains, and the Gout, to place the Rag upon a Piece of a &s;oft, thin Bladder; and, when moi&s;ten'd with the AETHER, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o bind it gently upon the Part. A &s;light Redne&s;s u&s;ually
<PB N="13" REF="13">appears upon the Part after the Application, but it quickly vani&s;hes; but it may &s;ometimes happen, where the Skin is very tender and too much AETHER has been applied to the Forehead, or within the Ears, that it may affect the Skin more than the Patient choo&s;es; which is avoided by applying a le&s;s Quantity for the future. This is the Secret of a pre&s;ent famous Practi|tioner, who having a Method &s;ometimes of concealing his Application, is &s;aid to cure the Head-ach, fixed Rheumatic Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Touch of his Hand.</P>
<P>IT is very ea&s;y to conceive, from the extreme Sub|tlety of this Medicine, that it mu&s;t produce many ex|cellent Effects in &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as tho&s;e above menti|oned, as it is converted into Vapour by a much le&s;s Heat than the common Animal One; &s;o that being &s;wallowed, it can hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any Part of the human Body under any Form but that of an extremely pene|trating volatiliz'd Vapour; and it is perceptible by it's Smell, as it pa&s;&s;es thro' the Pores of the Skin, &s;e|veral Hours after taking; &s;o that it's &s;tay in the Body is longer, and it's Effects there more durable, than might be expected from &s;uch a &s;ubtle Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the extreme Subtlety of the AETHER, it is perfectly innocent and &s;afe to take, as it contains nothing that is acrimonious or corro&s;ive; &s;o that it may be given even to the younge&s;t Children without He&s;itation. It neither purges nor vomits; nor does it encrea&s;e any of the &s;en&s;ible Evacuations, ex|cept that of Urine, and &s;ometimes that of Sweat, if taken when in Bed; but as it is &s;o di&s;tinctly perceived by the Smell pa&s;&s;ing thro' the cutaneous Pores of tho&s;e who take it, it is highly probable that it encrea&s;es in|&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14">
<P>ANOTHER ob&s;ervable Property in this Medicine is, that it does not coagulate or thicken the Serum of the Blood, but thins it; and therefore has direct contrary Effects to all the common Spirituous Compo&s;itions, when either taken inwardly, or externally applied, and is e&s;|&s;entially different from the mo&s;t &s;ubtiliz'd Vinous Spi|rits; for tho' Spirit of Wine is u&s;ed in making it, yet it is &s;o far decompo&s;ed by the Proce&s;s, that it's Nature is entirely changed. In con&s;equence of this Quality in the AETHER, the Publi&s;her has &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;&s;olved &s;ome particular ob&s;tinate Tumours, by applying it to them, when other Means have failed&mdash;This Hint He hopes will not pa&s;s unnoticed by the Gentlemen of the Faculty, as it is evident no Application whatever can equal it in Subtlety and Di&s;&s;olving Power.</P>
<P>THE Medicine &s;o much celebrated in <HI>Germany,</HI> and &s;o frequently commended and u&s;ed in Practice by the late famous Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Hoffman,</HI> under the Title of his <HI>Liquor Mineralis Anodynus,</HI> was nearly of the &s;ame Na|ture with the AETHER, but not &s;o powerful, nor &s;o highly &s;ubtilized.</P>
<P>REPEATED Experience has confirmed the Efficacy of this Medicine in all the Di&s;ea&s;es before mentioned; and from the Con&s;ideration of it's uncommon Qualities, it may be pre&s;umed to be an excellent Remedy in many others, if judiciou&s;ly given: Hence it &s;eems &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;o valuable an Addition to the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> as the AETHER doubtle&s;s is, &s;hould have been &s;o much neglected, or &s;o little known; but the Rea&s;ons are, that the Proce&s;s whereby it was made was kept &s;ecret by &s;ome who rated the Preparation at a very extrava|gant Price, and not &s;ufficiently attended to by others, who con&s;ider'd it only as a Chemical Curio&s;ity, not as a Medicine.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="15">
<P>THE chief Merit the Publi&s;her of this Account pre|tends to, is, <HI>the a&s;certaining the Medicinal Virtues of this curious Preparation,</HI> by &s;everal Years Experience, and making them more publickly known; <HI>the reducing it's Price,</HI> which has hitherto been &s;o extravagant that had it's Virtues and Properties been known, only a &s;mall number of the afflicted could have enjoy'd the Benefit of it; and, <HI>the bringing it to a greater Degree of Perfec|tion than any hitherto &s;old;</HI> what he offers being a per|fectly rectified Vitriolic AETHER.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper to give the Marks by which good AETHER may be known. It is per|fectly colourle&s;s, except it has receiv'd &s;ome accidental Tinge from the Cork of the Phial in which it has been kept; and &s;o volatile as to &s;trike the No&s;e very power|fully. It's Smell is more or le&s;s &s;ulphureous, accord|ing to the management of &s;ome Part of the Proce&s;s. Wetting the Finger with it, or dropping a little upon the Hand, it vani&s;hes in&s;tantly, and leaves no Moi&s;ture behind; &s;o that the Part &s;carcely &s;eems to have been wet. Half a Dozen Drops, dropped together upon a Table, will di&s;appear in a few Seconds of a Minute, and leave only the Appearance of a large oily Ring be|hind; but if it leaves the lea&s;t Watery or Spirituous Moi&s;ture, or does not evaporate in much le&s;s than a Minute, it is not good. The be&s;t AETHER will di&s;&s;olve in, or mix with, a certain Quantity of Water; and that is the be&s;t which requires the large&s;t Quantity of Water to di&s;&s;olve it: If, therefore, to &s;ix Tea Spoons|ful of Water in a &s;mall Phial, you add one of the AE|THER to be examined, cork up the Phial, and &s;hake them very well together; and upon &s;tanding a little while &s;ome part of the AETHER appears at Top, in form of Oil, &s;ufficient to cover the &s;urface of the Mixture, it may be pronounced good, (provided it
<PB N="16" REF="16">al&s;o an&s;wers in the other Methods of Trial) and the more appears the better is the AETHER; but if none appears, or not enough to cover the &s;urface of the Mixture, it was either adulterated, or not well rec|tified. If to this Mixture of AETHER and Water you add a little <HI>Salt of Tartar,</HI> and any Fermentation en&s;ues, the AETHER was not well rectified. Upon &s;haking bri&s;kly a Phial containing AETHER, if the Bubbles, or Proof as they are u&s;ually called, do not di&s;ap|pear in le&s;s Time, and in larger Bubbles, than any o|ther Liquor, (the Vinous Alcohol perhaps excepted) 'tis not Genuine.</P>
<P>IT is the more nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the&s;e Rules of proving the Quality of the AETHER, as the im|perfect Sorts have been found to di&s;agree with the Stomach, and produce other bad Effects, be&s;ides di&s;|appointing the Patient's Expectation.</P>
<P>THE AETHER that has the foremention'd Pro|perties, (for there are Preparations &s;old by the &s;ame Name, which are very imperfect Imitations of it) is made and &s;old by M. TURNER, Surgeon, in <HI>Liverpool.</HI> The Ounce Phial <HI>two Shillings;</HI> the Half Ounce <HI>one Shilling.</HI> The Phials are &s;quare; the Word AETHER in&s;cribed on one Side, and M. TURNER on the op|po&s;ite, and &s;ealed with a Lion gardant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Proper Abatement will be made to Druggi&s;ts, Apothecaries, or the Gentlemen of the Faculty who u&s;e any con&s;i|derable Quantity. To prevent it's e&s;cape and lo&s;s, a &s;mall Quantity of Water is put into each Phial, which &s;hould be kept with the Cork downwards, by which Means the AETHER is prevented, by the interpo&s;i|tion of the Water, from evaporating.</P>
<P>THE Publi&s;her has al&s;o appointed it to be &s;old by Mr. <HI>R. Board,</HI> Chemi&s;t and Druggi&s;t, in <HI>Grace-church-&s;treet;</HI> and Mr. <HI>J. Wilkie,</HI> Book&s;eller, at the Bible in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard, LONDON: and Mr. <HI>Peter Wil&s;on,</HI> Book&s;eller, in <HI>Dame-&s;treet,</HI> DUBLIN.</P>
