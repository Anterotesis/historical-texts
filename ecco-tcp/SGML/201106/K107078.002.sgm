<P>I COULD not get time till this day, to an&s;wer my Loui&s;a's very agreeable favour, of the 1&s;t in&s;tant, as &s;ome old friends of my mother's have been with us the&s;e ten days, and I could not leave them long enough to compo&s;e an epi&s;tle, for we were always engaged either in
<PB N="6" REF="4">conver&s;ation or cards, as I happened to plea&s;e the old ladies; and be&s;ides that, they played whi&s;t, and could not make a party without me.</P>
<P>I had a letter from Charles ye&s;terday; he had &s;ettled his affairs to his &s;atisfac|tion, and was returned to London, where, he &s;ays, his &s;tay will be but &s;hort, though he has made &s;ome agreeable acquaint|ances, and is engaged in a perpetual round of amu&s;ements; but adds, he has &s;o little reli&s;h for them when I am ab&s;ent, that he &s;hall quit them very &s;oon without the lea&s;t regret, and ha&s;ten to Dublin, where he hopes to meet me. Though I have not the lea&s;t doubt of his affection, I do not think my&s;elf bound to give credit to all he &s;ays on the &s;ubject; e&s;pe|cially as the liveline&s;s of his &s;tile contra|dicts what he &s;ays of not having a reli&s;h for amu&s;ement; I dare &s;ay, he enjoys them with a very good go&ucirc;t, nor am I &s;o weak as to expect he &s;hould not have any &s;atisfaction but when I am pre&s;ent.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>Poor Gertrude! Indeed I think &s;he mu&s;t have a good deal of re&s;olution, if &s;he can keep up her &s;pirits tolerably on the approaching change in her condition; for there is &s;omething very melancholy in the idea, of leaving ones friends and country for ever: I &s;hall be extremely &s;orry if they go before I get to town; though to be &s;ure &s;he will come over now and then to &s;ee us all, and no doubt you will &s;ome|times pay her a vi&s;it; if I can prevail on my mother to undertake it, we will make a party to &s;pend two or three months at Montpellier; and I think &s;he would be the better of it.</P>
<P>Gertrude's cou&s;ins are fine girls, I hope &s;he will provide agreeable young men for their partners: Harry Maun&s;ell, without doubt, will be a bride's-man, but we all know who will be the object of his atten|tion. You &s;ay there is very few to whom your example &s;hould be recommended; and I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, there is very few indeed who would chu&s;e to follow it; for notwith&s;tanding the many pretenders to &s;entiment in both &s;exes, there is not
<PB N="8" REF="6">one in a thou&s;and that has really &s;uch re|fined notions, as to be capable of con&s;i|dering love in any other light than as a pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o you need not be the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive that any of the Mi&s;&s;es will bring them&s;elves into danger, by at|tempting to adopt your ideas on the &s;ubject: for I mu&s;t confe&s;s you have a &s;ingularity in your opinions, that is per|fectly adapted to your &s;ituation; or, I believe, it will be rather more proper to &s;ay, you have adapted your &s;ituation to your &s;entiments; for it is certainly of your own chu&s;ing. You are a cha|racter, my dear Loui&s;a, an amiable one, every body acknowledges, but at the &s;ame time, very uncommon for &s;o young a per&s;on. I wi&s;h I was ju&s;t &s;uch another, for I do not know any body &s;o happy.</P>
<P>You are very &s;evere on fine feelings, and I cannot but &s;ay, the ladies you hint at have left you great room to be &s;o; however, I think it can be only an af|fectation of &s;en&s;ibility, when one feels only for them&s;elves; but weak nerves are &s;o fa&s;hionable, there is no being a fine lady without them.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<P>I have got my poor woman removed to her new habitation, and pre&s;ented her with your generous donation; part of which &s;he will apply to the purpo&s;es you mention, when &s;he is able to attend to tho&s;e matters; as yet &s;he is very weak, though &s;urprizingly recovered &s;ince &s;he has had proper care and nouri&s;hment; where &s;he is now all her neighbours will a&s;&s;i&s;t her, till &s;he is well enough to do her own work; and I am &s;ure they will al|ways be kind to her, for they know it will oblige me; and be&s;ides that, the natural di&s;po&s;ition of our country people, is compa&s;&s;ionate in a high degree: even the poor creatures &s;he lived near, when I met with her, &s;hared their &s;canty provi|&s;ion with her; I gave them all &s;ome little matter, and will do more for them here|after. I need hardly tell you what prayers were put up for your hap|pine&s;s, when I gave her your pre&s;ent; one may ea&s;ily &s;ee the woman has known better days, &s;he has &s;uch de|cent notions.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>I &s;hall be dull on the 10th, with the recollection of all the amu&s;ement I lo&s;e by being here. I &s;hall expect you will write to me next day, and will long for the arrival of the po&s;t.</P>
<P>I think it is quite right in Emily to di&s;courage any declaration from James till &s;he has changed her mourn|ing, at lea&s;t; there is &s;omething very indelicate in a woman li&s;tening to a lover, while in her weeds; even though &s;he had no rea&s;on to lament her hu&s;|band: but in a proper time I hope &s;he will lay a&s;ide her re&s;erve, and that her father will not object, though James has but a thou&s;and a year, and &s;he has four, be&s;ides all the money he can give her; yet the qualities of his mind ought to be con&s;idered. I &s;hall be much concerned if he is di&s;|appointed.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
<P>My mother joins me in wi&s;hing Ger|trude all the happine&s;s &s;he can expect or de&s;ire; as well as in affectionate regards to you.</P>

<P>IT was a mo&s;t uncon&s;cionable ta&s;k you impo&s;ed on me, Eliza, to write the day after a wedding, when all the folks are crouding to pay their compli|ments, and I as mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e ought to be ready to receive them; how|ever as I feared the di&s;appointment might be too much for you, I have left the bride to do the honours to her own com|pany, with Mrs. Rochfort to a&s;&s;i&s;t her: and I a&s;&s;ure you, Gertrude looks very matronly to-day, and becomes her title extremely. I have quite provoked her, by &s;aying, her lady&s;hip when I &s;poke of her, or to her; you may think it was to
<PB N="13" REF="11">make her laugh I did it, as you know I am not much dazzled by titles: but I mu&s;t tell you about ye&s;terday; for to hear of a wedding is the delight of all females, from fifteen to fifty. Gertrude, by my advice, was dre&s;&s;ed early, and in the drawing-room before the company came, as I thought it would di&s;tre&s;s her le&s;s than coming in where they were all a&s;&s;embled; &s;he had only a white &s;attin night-gown and petticoat, trimmed with ermine, gauze apron, and blond cap, and robbins, with a very fine net tippet, no jewels, except three brilliant pins in her cap, which there was no being with|out, but &s;he wore as few as po&s;&s;ible, be|cau&s;e &s;he did not wi&s;h to be glittering. My gown was off the &s;ame piece, trimmed al&s;o like hers, but I had a lay-lock &s;attin petticoat, elegantly quilted; the re&s;t of my dre&s;s quite in her &s;tile, except I had a beautiful painted gauze &s;hawl, in&s;tead of a tippet: her cou&s;ins were as fine as hands could make them, in white and &s;ilver, and a profu&s;ion of diamonds in their hair.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="12">
<P>Captain St. George, and Mr. Fitz|maurice were bride's-men, as were Mr. Fitzgerald, and Harry Maun&s;ell.</P>
<P>The Count had a &s;uit of pearl colour tabbinet, with a &s;light pattern of &s;ilver, and he really looked very hand&s;ome; but I have &s;een Gertrude look better than &s;he did; &s;he was rather pale, and kept up her &s;pirits very indifferently: a woman cannot appear to advantage at her own wedding, unle&s;s &s;he is very thoughtle&s;s indeed.</P>
<P>The company were all a&s;&s;embled at &s;even o'clock, and the in&s;tant the tea|table was removed, the bride-groom &s;tept forward, and leading out the bride, the ce|remony was immediately performed, and &s;he went through it much better than I expected, but was very near fainting when it was over; &s;he &s;oon recovered her&s;elf, and when cake and wine was handed about, we all &s;at down to cards, till &s;upper, except Mr. O'Neil, and your
<PB N="15" REF="13">cou&s;in James, who retired into another room, and played back-gammon till ten o'clock, when the old gentleman went home, but as a very particular compli|ment to Gertrude and me, permitted his wife to &s;tay as long as &s;he plea&s;ed; and I a&s;&s;ure you, that was a very great favour to us, and a remarkable indulgence to her; had I been his wife, it is an indul|gence I would take without his leave, for I &s;hould not &s;ubmit to be treated like a child.</P>
<P>Supper pa&s;&s;ed over chearfully, and about twelve, Mrs. Pon&s;onby, (being the olde&s;t matron in company) ro&s;e to withdraw, and was followed by all the ladies: Gertrude, indeed, would have encrea&s;ed her own confu&s;ion, by being the la&s;t to move, only I perceived her &s;lowne&s;s, and pretending her chair was on my gown, obliged her to ri&s;e, and putting her forward among&s;t the bride|maids, hurried her off, before the gentle|men had time to ob&s;erve her; when the young ladies had got garter and pins to dream on, all the women went home,
<PB N="16" REF="14">and the Count quitting his company &s;oon after, they were all gone by one o'clock. To-day we had &s;everal morn|ing vi&s;itors, and the young folks that were at the marriage, are to &s;pend the evening with us. This week will be in|tirely taken up in receiving compliments, and the next in returning them; for as Gertrude's &s;tay here will be very &s;hort, it is nece&s;&s;ary for her to get that piece of ceremony over as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: I &s;hall be heartily glad when it is over, for I am fatigued with the bu&s;tle we have had this while pa&s;t; you know I am no friend to a continual round of di&s;&s;ipation. I have not time now to take notice of your la&s;t, nor does it require any particular an&s;wer. I give you joy of hearing from Charles, and hope I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee you both in Dublin.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Mr. SKEFFINGTON, to Mr. MAUNSELL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>Feb. 12. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR MAUNSELL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been about three weeks in this centre of Amu&s;ements, and &s;o borne down by the torrent of di&s;&s;ipati|on with which people here are over|whelmed, that I could not find time to perform my promi&s;e of writing to you, till this day, that a violent cold has ob|liged me to &s;tay at home and nur&s;e my|&s;elf; I got it by walking home late from a Tavern.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="16">
<P>To confe&s;s the truth, raking does not agree with me, but it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand the temptations that are con|tinually thrown in one's way, in a place where vice puts on the mo&s;t alluring form, and covers her deformity with the &s;pacious appearance of plea&s;ure, which one mu&s;t be almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t; at lea&s;t, till experience has taught us wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>You cautioned me again&s;t Sharpers, and I was on my guard; but you did not tell me, I might be in as much danger from tho&s;e who&s;e birth intitled them to be called Gentlemen; but perhaps you never met with &s;uch, I would hardly be|lieve it my&s;elf, if I had not purcha&s;ed my knowledge at the extravagant rate of two thou&s;and pounds. I did not at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pect, but latterly I perceived the cheat, and ri&s;ing, gave the gentleman a draft on my Banker for the money, in|forming him at the &s;ame time, I did not
<PB N="19" REF="17">chu&s;e to play any longer with one who under&s;tood all the game; and in&s;tantly quit the room, expecting he would fol|low to demand an explanation, as there was a deal of company pre&s;ent, who all heard what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>It happened as I thought, for I had not gone ten yards when he came up with me, and a&s;king what my words meant, I an&s;wered, the meaning was &s;o very obvious it could &s;carely be mi&s;taken; on which he drew his &s;word, and bid me defend my&s;elf: I did it &s;o effectually, that in le&s;s than a minute I wounded him in the &s;word arm, and the weapon drop|ped from his hand; as he bled fa&s;t, I advi&s;ed him to return to the hou&s;e we had ju&s;t left, and &s;end for a Surgeon; then bidding him good night, &s;tepped into a Chair I met, and went home very much di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had no apology for playing &s;o deep, becau&s;e my fortune is already too large to receive any advantage from winning
<PB N="20" REF="18">that &s;um, and though the lo&s;s is no way material to me, yet &s;ince I had it to &s;pare, I might have di&s;po&s;ed of it in a way that would have made &s;everal happy: the event too, might have been fatal, and duelling, you know, I greatly di&s;|approve; but when his unfair practices were &s;o plain, that I mu&s;t &s;ee it, I &s;hould have been looked on either as a fool or a coward, if I had not taken notice of it.</P>
<P>I took great care, however, not to wound him in a dangerous place, for I &s;oon perceived he had very little &s;kill: he is recovering fa&s;t, but I &s;hall always chu&s;e to avoid his company, as I mu&s;t di&s;like the man; be&s;ides, I am deter|mined never to play again, but for a few guineas, which will not be worth any one's while to cheat for.</P>
<P>My intercour&s;e with the other Sex has been more agreeable; for affairs of Gallantry have offered every day without
<PB N="21" REF="19">my &s;eeking. I &s;hould be &s;orry my love|ly Eliza knew how I have been led a&s;tray, though they were only venial tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, in which the heart was no way concerned, and indeed, the man mu&s;t be void of all pa&s;&s;ion that could with|&s;tand &s;uch temptations.</P>
<P>The women have &s;uch a fund of vi|vacity, that they are the mo&s;t agreeable mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in the world; but for a wife, I would prefer the more re&s;erved chear|fulne&s;s of my pretty country-women. That, perhaps, may be prejudice; for it is likely an Engli&s;h-man would think them in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>I have paid pretty high for my amu&s;e|ments in this way, though I a&s;&s;ure you, it was not with tho&s;e who &s;et their charms to &s;ale; but pre&s;ents mu&s;t be made, and of value according to the rank of the fair one.</P>
<P>In all my dealings here, I find money is the Idol of the place, and the whole
<PB N="22" REF="20">force of the people's genius is turned towards the different methods of obtain|ing it.</P>
<P>I often think if a medium could be &s;truck between the Engli&s;h and the Iri&s;h, it would ju&s;t produce a proper &s;tandard whereby to regulate our oeconomy; for one loves Gold too much for their eter|nal welfare, the other too little for their temporal peace; as their total di&s;regard of it keeps their dome&s;tic affairs in con|tinual embarra&s;&s;ment: I &s;peak of the general character of the two nations; for I know there are many exceptions in each.</P>
<P>I made an acquaintance in Su&s;&s;ex, with a Mi&s;s Freeman, who was in a vi|&s;it with a family where I was intimate; &s;he lives in London, and when &s;he was coming to town, a few days before me, gave me an invitation to her aunt's hou&s;e in Jermyn-&s;treet, where &s;he lives. I availed my&s;elf of it, and have pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal agreeable evenings there.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="21">
<P>They are genteel people, and very plea&s;|ing. Mi&s;s Freeman is a pretty lively girl, about nineteen; her aunt's daughter &s;omething younger, and hand&s;omer, but more &s;erious than her cou&s;in. I find the former has a large fortune at her own di&s;po&s;al: I believe the aunt gave me that hint with &s;ome view, but my heart is already fixed, and if Eliza's &s;entiments remain unaltered at my return, I have nothing more to wi&s;h for, except being at age, as I cannot marry till then; but I have a very &s;hort time to wait for that.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not expect to hear from you, &s;ince I mean to &s;et out for Ireland in le&s;s than a week, and hope to find you and all tho&s;e I mo&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee, in Dublin.</P>
<P>My be&s;t compliments to Mi&s;s Morti|mer, but do not tell her I am indi&s;po&s;ed, for I &s;hall write to Eliza this po&s;t, and will not mention it, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be unea&s;y.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="22">
<P>Tell Fitzgerald, I have ju&s;t received his letter, and will an&s;wer it if I have time, before I quit London.</P>

<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of my dear Loui|&s;a's letter, with an account of the wedding, and beg you will make my mother's compliments of congratulation, with mine, acceptable to Madame La Comte&s;&s;e. Seriou&s;ly, no one can wi&s;h her happier than we do; and I hope to have an opportunity of telling her &s;o in per&s;on, before &s;he leaves Ireland, as we
<PB N="26" REF="24">are to &s;et out for Dublin in ten days, which has rai&s;ed my &s;pirits more effectu|ally, than a large do&s;e of ASSA-FAE|TIDA. Indeed there is no one induce|ment here, to make me wi&s;h to &s;tay; for though the place is beautiful in Sum|mer, at this &s;ea&s;on I can find nothing plea&s;ing in the country, e&s;pecially when every one is gone to town, except a few old ladies and gentlemen, that are kept pri&s;oners by the Gout, or el&s;e are pa&s;t all inclination for amu&s;ement; and them you may think cannot be very agreeable companions for me.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle, who returned a few days ago, is the only one that keeps us alive; he left his daughters in Dublin, and brought me a letter from the elde&s;t, re|que&s;ting, if I was not to be in town very &s;oon, I would give her &s;ome excu&s;e to make you a vi&s;it; for &s;he longs of all things to be acquainted with you: and though &s;he could be ea&s;ily introduced, by &s;ome who vi&s;it you, yet, as an inti|macy
<PB N="27" REF="25">is what &s;he wi&s;hes for, &s;he &s;ays, that would be &s;ooner accompli&s;hed if &s;he brought her credentials from me; the&s;e are her own words.</P>
<P>I have wrote, to inform her, I &s;hall &s;oon be in town, when I &s;hall perform the part of Sir Clement Cottrel, and in|troduce her to your pre&s;ence. Mean time, if you &s;hould meet her in compa|ny, as probably you may, I flatter my|&s;elf, you will, on my recommendation, make &s;ome advances towards an ac|quaintance; and I am very &s;ure you will like her, and her &s;i&s;ter too, though not &s;o well, for the rea&s;ons I mention|ed. She is equally de&s;irous of being ac|quainted with you.</P>
<P>Their father will be in town again &s;hortly.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="26">
<P>I have not heard from Charles &s;ince. Little as he &s;ays he reli&s;hes amu&s;ements, I find they engage a good deal of his attention, el&s;e he might have wrote to me more than once, &s;ince he has been in London.</P>
<P>I expect you will an&s;wer this, as I have &s;till ten days to &s;tay here; and my next will be ju&s;t to tell you, what day I &s;et out for Dublin.</P>

<P>MY dear Eliza's letter has given me infinite plea&s;ure, by informing me I may &s;oon hope to &s;ee her. Gertrude too, is quite joyful, for &s;he began to fear &s;he &s;hould be gone before you arrived.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;he begins to lay a&s;ide her me|lancholy, except at times, when &s;he thinks of leaving us; and I a&s;&s;ure you, it is well you have had a letter from your Swain, who he &s;uppo&s;es has left
<PB N="31" REF="29">London ere this; but you will hear from him by this po&s;t, for he &s;ays, at the conclu&s;ion of his, to Harry, he was go|ing to write to you.</P>
<P>He mentions a Mi&s;s Freeman he is ac|quainted with there, and her cou&s;in, as pretty agreeable girls; and &s;ays, he pa&s;&s;es &s;ome of his hours very plea&s;ingly with them; you need not, however, be alarmed, for he, in the &s;ame paragraph, &s;peaks of you as the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Maun&s;ell read all tho&s;e extracts to me, but did not offer to &s;hew me the letter, from which I gue&s;s he gives &s;ome account of his Adventures; and I believe the adventures of young men in London are not always fit for females to hear; &s;o I would not a&s;k to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I hope this is the la&s;t I &s;hall write to you for this &s;ea&s;on, as I expect the re|turn of the po&s;t will inform me that you

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Feb. 22. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure to acquaint my dear Loui&s;a, we &s;hall begin our jour|ney the 24th; but as my mother is &s;till weak, and cannot bear fatigue, we &s;hall be four days on the road, &s;o the 28th in the evening I expect to find you waiting for me, that we may lo&s;e no time, in once more enjoying each other's &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The &s;ame po&s;t brought me your letter, and one from Charles; as you &s;uppo&s;ed he
<PB N="34" REF="32">will not leave London till the 27th; and as he does not mean to travel po&s;t, I &s;hall be in Dublin &s;ome days before him. He does not mention Mi&s;s Freeman to me, but I a&s;&s;ure you, I am not a bit inclined to be jealous of her, or any other per&s;on; I am rather apt to fear my unea&s;ine&s;s will ari&s;e from Mr. Skeffington's having too much affection for me, than too little; but I hope his going more into the gay world than he u&s;ed to do, will cure him of any little defect in his tem|per, for people who have confined them|&s;elves much to their &s;tudy, are apt to fall into &s;ome particularity, which they grow a&s;hamed of when they &s;ee more of life.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mr. Maun&s;ell had &s;hewn you his letter, for his not doing it, makes me think there was &s;omething about me in it, that he was unwilling you &s;hould &s;ee: though upon con&s;ideration, I believe it is more likely to be as you imagine; for as Harry knows how much you intere&s;t your&s;elf in my happine&s;s, he would hardly conceal any thing that was mate|rial to it from you.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="33">
<P>I am obliged to you for your intention of taking notice of the Mi&s;s Boyles, if you meet them before I arrive, I would not reque&s;t it of you, but I am &s;ure you will find them agreeable, and I expect we &s;hall be very happy together, while they &s;tay in town, which I dare &s;ay will be till the Parliament is up, for their aunt &s;tays till then.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but you will cure Harriet of her affectation, for I never met with any one that had the art of making one a&s;hamed of their own foibles, without giving offence, equal to you; your raillery is &s;o void of &s;atire, that it both plea&s;es and in&s;tructs.</P>
<P>I do think it is be&s;t for Mr. Maun&s;ell to be ab&s;ent from you; for though I have no idea he can ever cea&s;e to love you, &s;ince his attachment is of &s;o long a &s;tand|ing, yet I dare &s;ay, variety of objects will amu&s;e his mind, and keep it from dwelling &s;o ince&s;&s;antly on a &s;ubject that
<PB N="36" REF="34">mu&s;t di&s;tre&s;s him, as he has not the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope to &s;upport his &s;pirits with; and I agree with you, that &s;ome variation of place and company, is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make life plea&s;ing: a love of &s;ociety is natural to us, and without en|joying it in a moderate degree, every one mu&s;t &s;ink into gloomine&s;s, and, like your friends, will grow peevi&s;h and di&s;|&s;atisfied, for it is impo&s;&s;ible that three or four people, living con&s;tantly together, retired from the re&s;t of the world, can always find a fund of conver&s;ation or en|tertainment in each other. I know it by experience, when I am in the country with my mother and Charles, who I need not tell you, are two of tho&s;e I love be&s;t; yet when we are any time without com|pany, or going abroad, I find my&s;elf grow &s;tupid, and tired of every thing about me; to tell truth, I am at this in|&s;tant in the very &s;tate I am de&s;cribing, as I think my letter will convince you.</P>
<P>I am very glad I do not belong to the comfortable family you mention; what a treat your company mu&s;t be to the young
<PB N="37" REF="35">people, for I &s;uppo&s;e they are not much delighted with the comforts of being &s;hut up from &s;ociety, though their pa|rents may have out-lived all ta&s;te for earthly enjoyments; very thankful am I that my mother is not of that di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Farewell till the 28th, when I &s;hall have the happine&s;s of telling you in per|&s;on, how affectionately I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. MISS MORTIMER, TO THE COUNTESS ROUSILLON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>May 6. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE receipt of my dear Gertrude's letter, relieved me from great un|ea&s;ine&s;s, which I &s;uffered by not getting an account of your arrival in France; but the round you took, and all the vi&s;its you made to the Count's relations, on your journey, is &s;ufficient rea&s;on for my not hearing from you &s;ooner. I am happy to find they all received you &s;o kindly; for politene&s;s alone would be only what you had a right to expect; one wi&s;hes to meet with &s;omething more from the family they go into; and it gives me much &s;atisfaction, that you
<PB N="39" REF="37">have met with that tenderne&s;s and affec|tion, which I am &s;ure you will merit from them.</P>
<P>Your departure made us all melan|choly; and each morning when Emily and I met at breakfa&s;t, we renewed each other's concern, by ob&s;erving how lonely we were without poor Gertrude; and in|deed, if I was inclined to forget you, Wil&s;on would not let me, for &s;he laments you daily, when &s;he comes to take my orders, and brings her accounts for my in&s;pection, always ob&s;erving how good you were, to &s;pare me that trouble; and I mu&s;t acknowlege I have a lo&s;s of you in that re&s;pect, though &s;he is &s;o careful and exact, that I find it le&s;s di&s;agreeable than it would be, if I had a different &s;ort of per&s;on in her place; but &s;he is faithful and hone&s;t, and I e&s;teem &s;uch a &s;ervant to be invaluable.</P>
<P>I have had &s;everal letters from Harry, &s;ince you left him in London, and think he is recovering his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s; the
<PB N="40" REF="38">fir&s;t to be &s;ure was filled with lamentati|ons and regrets, and all the etcetera's of &s;oft non&s;en&s;e; but I have ab&s;olutely pro|hibited that &s;ubject, on pain of returning his letters unan&s;wered: he murmured a little at my cruelty, but was obliged to comply with the re&s;triction; and now he writes like a rational creature, and is a very plea&s;ing corre&s;pondent. Your CARO-SPOSO did him no good, for he encouraged him in all his romance and folly, and only for this fortunate call to England, I &s;hould have had him &s;ighing, and dying at my feet, till both for his &s;ake, and my own, I would have been under a nece&s;&s;ity of quarrelling with him; when he goes to France, I beg you will not indulge him in talking of certain cir|cum&s;tances, that had better be for|got.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton has been in town this month; Charles and he are on the mo&s;t friendly terms, without any appearance of the &s;u&s;picions his pre&s;ence formerly rai&s;ed; &s;o you may judge how happy Eliza is: I &s;uppo&s;e matters will &s;oon be
<PB N="41" REF="39">brought to a conclu&s;ion there, as Mr. Skeffington will be at age early in June, and then I think there will be nothing to prevent it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Freeman, that you heard him mention, has been in Dublin &s;ome weeks, and I have a &s;trong idea, that it is an at|tachment to Charles has brought her over. She &s;ays, &s;he was ordered &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s for a di&s;order in her &s;tomach; and as &s;he had a de&s;ire to &s;ee Dublin, &s;he thought &s;he might as well come here as any where; the &s;tory is plau&s;ible, and I fancy is believed by every one but me: however, if &s;he was ill, the remedy has been very effectual, for &s;he has not the lea&s;t remains of any complaint whatever; be&s;ides, I think it very extraordinary, that her friends would let her come to a &s;trange country, in &s;uch ill health, without any companion but her waiting-maid.</P>
<P>She has brought letters of introduction to &s;ome genteel families here, who of cour&s;e pay great attention to her; but I
<PB N="42" REF="40">ob&s;erve &s;he takes great pains to cultivate an intimacy with Eliza, who went to vi&s;it her, on account of the civility &s;he and her aunt had &s;hewn Mr. Skeffington, for &s;he &s;ent to him the day after &s;he arrived, and had fir&s;t fixed her&s;elf in a lodging next &s;treet to him.</P>
<P>Eliza gave her a general invitation, to come to them whenever &s;he was di&s;en|gaged, and &s;he avails her&s;elf of it in a manner that &s;hews &s;he means to be quite on free terms with her; all the&s;e things make me very ob&s;ervant of her, as I fear &s;he has &s;ome &s;cheme of &s;upplanting Eliza in Charles's affections; I do not, how|ever, think that would be ea&s;ily done, unle&s;s &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover that tincture of jealou&s;y in his temper, by which he might he wrought upon.</P>
<P>She is rather pretty, and uncommonly lively. In my opinion, if her vivacity was a little tempered with di&s;cretion, &s;he would be much more agreeable, for at pre&s;ent it borders upon levity.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="41">
<P>I know the Engli&s;h women are of a more &s;prightly di&s;po&s;ition than the Iri&s;h; but I never met any of them that could not &s;et &s;ome bounds to it, but this young lady, who quite over-powers me with her amazing volubility, and you know I have a downright horror of being talked to death. One happine&s;s to her hearers is, &s;he does not talk non&s;en&s;e, and though I am not much delighted with her, &s;he is generally thought agreeable.</P>
<P>I can perceive I am no great favourite with her, notwith&s;tanding &s;he effects an e&s;teem for me to Eliza; but I am &s;ure &s;he would not wi&s;h I was &s;o often at that hou&s;e, for &s;he has &s;aid (more than once) &s;he believed I had a deal of penetration.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid perhaps too much on &s;ur|mi&s;e, (for I acknowlege it is nothing more) except &s;o far as relates to her liking Charles, which I have no doubt about; but my &s;u&s;picions aro&s;e from
<PB N="44" REF="42">ob&s;ervations I have made on her beha|viour.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, be well plea&s;ed to lo&s;e my character for penetration in this particular.&mdash;Mr. Fitzgerald has declared him&s;elf in form to Mrs. Roch|fort; and &s;he has po&s;itively refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to him again on that &s;ubject, du|ring the fir&s;t year of her widow-hood; a pretty hint that, for him to renew it at the expiration of that time. When &s;he told me what pa&s;&s;ed between them, I &s;aid, very &s;eriou&s;ly, (but with a &s;ignificant look) it was really kind of her to limit his time of probation. She had not been aware of the inference I would draw, and it threw her into the utmo&s;t confu|&s;ion; when &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he &s;aid, no one would think of &s;uch a thing but my|&s;elf: if, &s;aid I, Mr. Fitzgerald does not think of it, he is more dull of apprehen|&s;ion than any lover I ever heard of; but do not be unea&s;y, for you know widows are privileged to give a mode&s;t hint of their intentions. She blu&s;hed &s;o exce&s;|&s;ively, and &s;eemed &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that I
<PB N="45" REF="43">pitied her, though I could not help laughing at her being &s;o affected; but &s;he has an uncommon degree of ba&s;h ful|ne&s;s: I relieved her, by &s;aying, I owed her that teizing for her re&s;erve to me on that affair; for &s;he con&s;tantly denied her partiality for James, though it was very vi&s;ible, and I was determined to mortify her for it.</P>
<P>I allow it is not delicate to make open declaration of our favourable opinion of a man, however worthy he may be; but to deny it &s;o po&s;itively to a particular friend, that one was living in the hou&s;e with, looks, I think, either like prudery, or di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he found I had taken it ami&s;s, &s;he apologized, by a&s;&s;uring me, it pro|ceeded only from a wi&s;h to conceal her &s;entiments from every body, (even her&s;elf if po&s;&s;ible) till &s;he knew if her father would approve of Mr. Fitzgerald, as &s;he meant to be guided by him. I could not help &s;aying, I thought it would be carrying
<PB N="46" REF="44">her obedience too far; though I have as high a notion of the duty we owe our parents as mo&s;t people; but as &s;he had once made her&s;elf unhappy to oblige him, I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ult his caprice in a &s;econd choice, when we knew his love of money, and that inequality of fortune, was the only ob|jection could be made in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. She certainly ought to inform her father of the affair, but if he objected merely on the grounds I mention, I did not think &s;he was under any obligation to comply with an unrea&s;onable hu|mour, con&s;idering &s;he was now her own mi&s;tre&s;s: if &s;he was &s;till under her parents authority, I &s;hould think her right extended no farther than to refu&s;e a per&s;on &s;he could not be hap|py with, but not to marry any one again&s;t their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to join in my opinion, but &s;aid &s;he had been u&s;ed to obey &s;o implicitly, and be&s;ides was of &s;uch a timid di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he doubted if &s;he
<PB N="47" REF="45">would have re&s;olution to follow her own inclinations.</P>
<P>I hope &s;he will not be put to the trial, as Mr. O'Neil profe&s;&s;es a mo&s;t violent friend&s;hip for James, and &s;ets him up as a pattern for all young men that he knows.</P>
<P>I &s;hall continue to write to you an account of all our proceedings here, without the formality of waiting for an an&s;wer, &s;ince the war prevents a re|gular intercour&s;e between the two coun|tries.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;s Boyles and I are become intimate; you were prejudiced in their favour by the little you had &s;een of them before you left us, and if you had known more of them, you would like them &s;till better, as they improve on an acquaintance; particularly Har|riet, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e is a little ob|&s;cured by affectation, which however
<PB N="48" REF="46">&s;he is throwing off very fa&s;t; you can|not think how much I made her a|&s;hamed of it, &s;o much, that it is only long habit makes her ever practi&s;e it, and the lea&s;t look from me corrects her.</P>
<P>I think Mr. Hamilton begins to at|tach him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Boyle, but I do not find it is ob&s;erved by any one el&s;e, nor am I quite &s;ure of it, but I wi&s;h it may be &s;o, &s;ince it would remove all cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s from Charles, as he is the only one he ever &s;eemed to fear would rival him.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle is my CE CISBEO, and flirts mo&s;t delightfully, con&s;idering he is old enough to be my father. I am a prodigious favourite of his, and indeed I return the compliment, for I think him the mo&s;t chearful, plea&s;ing man, I ever met with; of an elderly one, I mean.</P>
<PB N="49" REF="47">
<P>You mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a million of com|pliments and good wi&s;hes, from all your friends and acquaintances here, for it would fill a &s;heet of paper to enumerate them.&mdash;Do not be jealous that I de&s;ire my love to your hu&s;band. Are not you &s;hocked at &s;uch an ob&s;olete epithet?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX. Mi&s;s FREEMAN, to Mi&s;s VERNON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>May 8. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my arrival in this metropolis, I have wrote three letters to my dear Charlotte, and have received but one from her; but as the packets are kept out by contrary winds, I take it for grant|ed, your an&s;wers to my other two are detained by that means, and &s;hall pro|ceed to give you an account of my Iri&s;h acquaintances.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="49">
<P>I have already informed you of the polite, or, I may rather &s;ay, kind recep|tion I met with, from every family to whom I brought letters; and I have now to tell you, their civility rather increa&s;es every day; indeed I think there is no end to the attention a &s;tranger meets with in this land of ho&s;pitality, which has in &s;pite of all my prejudices, reconciled me to a people of whom we are taught to entertain the mo&s;t unju&s;t ideas; for I a&s;|&s;ure you, I find them the very rever&s;e of every thing our country folks u&s;ually imagine them to be: and I begin to &s;ee, it is very illiberal to &s;uppo&s;e merit is con|fined to any one particular clime or king|dom.</P>
<P>I told you Mi&s;s Fitzgerald, (Skeffing|ton's intended) had paid me a vi&s;it, and given me a genteel invitation to go to their hou&s;e, whenever I was not other|wi&s;e engaged, as they live in the next &s;treet, for I took care to fix my&s;elf near them. She has &s;ince &s;hewed, &s;he meant more than mere compliment, for &s;he
<PB N="52" REF="50">came her&s;elf &s;everal times and took me with her, after taking me airing, or to &s;uch places in the town, as &s;he thought worth my &s;eeing; &s;o we were now as free as if we had been acquainted this twelve month.</P>
<P>She is a pretty gentle &s;oul, entirely compo&s;ed of the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and has too much &s;en&s;ibility for her own peace of mind, which I am very &s;orry for, &s;ince there is a great deal of un|ea&s;ine&s;s in &s;tore for her; I wi&s;h it was otherwi&s;e, but I never was u&s;ed to put any per&s;on's happine&s;s in competition with my own; a &s;tranger cannot there|fore expect that compliment from me; be&s;ides I really think I &s;hall do them a &s;ervice in &s;eparating them, for were two &s;uch quiet mortals as Skeffington and &s;he, to go together, they would inevit|ably fall into a lethargy, by the perfect &s;amene&s;s of each other's temper: now if I take him, I believe I may engage to keep him from that di&s;order, by the continual variety of my di&s;po&s;ition; not to &s;ay any thing of my &s;pirit, which I
<PB N="53" REF="51">flatter my&s;elf is &s;ufficient to keep any man awake, for though I love him to di&s;|traction, and will go any lengths to obtain him, I do not mean to be the &s;ame turtle, when married, that his Eliza would be: it is nece&s;&s;ary to rou&s;e them &s;ometimes, that they may &s;et the higher value on your good temper, when you chu&s;e to treat them with it.</P>
<P>There is a Mi&s;s Mortimer that &s;tands very much in my way, for &s;he is Eliza's bo&s;om friend, and chief advi&s;er, &s;he is very civil to me, and a&s;ks me to her par|ties; but &s;he has quick di&s;cernment, and, I think, ob&s;erves me with a penetrating eye; for which rea&s;on I am in awe of her, and of cour&s;e do not like her; but that I keep to my&s;elf, for I find &s;he is a general favourite, even among&s;t the wo|men, though very much the ta&s;te of the men.&mdash;Is not this odd? She is not hand&s;ome, but has great expre&s;&s;ion in her countenance, and is by no means ugly; her di&s;po&s;ition is exceedingly live|ly, and a vein of humour runs through her conver&s;ation, that makes it va&s;tly
<PB N="54" REF="52">plea&s;ing; however, her vivacity never leads her into an impropriety, for her under&s;tanding is in the &s;uperior degree, and &s;he conducts her&s;elf with the &s;ame prudence you might expect from her grand-mother. I have been particular in my de&s;cription of her, becau&s;e I think her rather an extraordinary cha|racter for a woman, not above four and twenty: but do you know, I hate tho&s;e pieces of infallibility; their man|ners are a tacit reproach on us, who are too volatile to be re&s;trained by dull rules of decorum.</P>
<P>The women here, would, in general &s;uit your ta&s;te better than mine; for though very chearful, they have a &s;e|datene&s;s in them, that would be ju&s;t the thing for you, who are a good deal in that &s;tile your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have this in&s;tant got a piece of intel|ligence, that is of the utmo&s;t importance to me: Skeffington has a &s;park of jealou&s;y in his bo&s;om, which if I do not
<PB N="55" REF="53">blow into a flame, I de&s;erve to lo&s;e him. It never broke out till within the&s;e few months; the per&s;on who rai&s;ed it is a Mr. Hamilton, a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young man; he is at pre&s;ent in town; is very intimate at Mrs. Fitzgerald's, and &s;eems to be on the mo&s;t friendly terms with Charles; however &s;ince he once looked on him as a rival, there can be no great difficulty in placing him in the &s;ame light again, for &s;u&s;picions of that na|ture may be revived with very little addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Letty, whom I ordered to make an ac|quaintance with Mi&s;s Fitzgerald's maid, got this information from her; but as &s;he is not in her mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ecrets, &s;he could not tell how he was convinced there was no cau&s;e for his fears; it was from &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions of his own, &s;he di&s;covered his foible; &s;he &s;aid &s;he told her lady of it at the time, who bid her not mention it, and &s;he never heard more of it after, though &s;he per|ceived her very low-&s;pirited at times, till of late &s;he &s;eems quite ea&s;y: be that as it
<PB N="56" REF="54">may, I think I cannot fail of &s;ucceeding, now I know his weak &s;ide, as I &s;hall di|rect all my attack again&s;t that; but how I &s;hall proceed, I cannot at pre&s;ent in|form you, &s;ince my operations mu&s;t be determined by the circum&s;tance of the moment.</P>
<P>I never gave you a more convincing proof of the confidence I place in you, than by letting you into my intention of going &s;uch lengths to accompli&s;h my wi&s;hes, &s;ince I know you will not ap|prove of it; but I al&s;o know, your affec|tion for me, will prevent your taking any &s;teps to fru&s;trate my de&s;igns, as your knowledge of my di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t tell you, &s;uch a mea&s;ure would inevita|bly be attended with fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Whatever I do, mu&s;t be done &s;oon, for he will be at age in a few weeks, and they are to be married as &s;oon after, as he can go through &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary forms of law, to enable him to make proper &s;ettlements; for notwith&s;tanding they
<PB N="57" REF="55">have loved, and been intended for each other from their infancy, &s;he has pa|tiently waited till all the&s;e matters could be done regularly.</P>
<P>So important do the ladies here e&s;teem the &s;ecurity of their fortunes, that a girl who would marry without that precau|tion, would be looked on as a prodigy of imprudence, while we give away thou&s;ands, without a&s;king any return but love. Surely the Iri&s;h women mu&s;t have very cold con&s;titutions, or very great command of their pa&s;&s;ions, el&s;e their rea&s;on could not act &s;o powerfully.</P>
<P>What has rea&s;on and love to do with each other! The a&s;&s;ociation is unnatu|ral, and never entered into a brea&s;t truly occupied by that tender pa&s;&s;ion, as I can vouch from experience.</P>
<P>I would not venture to &s;peak &s;o open|ly, but that I know your mother cannot be returned to town yet; if you &s;hould
<PB N="58" REF="56">find &s;he means to come &s;ooner than we expected, let me know, as I would not for the world one of my letters &s;hould fall into her hands: no doubt &s;he was greatly a&s;toni&s;hed when you informed her I was gone to Ireland.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not expect I &s;hall write fre|quently now as I have done, becau&s;e my mind will be otherwi&s;e employed.</P>

<P>Chance has been favourable to my de&s;ign, and put it in a train, that perhaps my own ingenuity could not have &s;o ea&s;ily brought about: Mi&s;s Fitzgerald, and Mr. Hamilton have accidentally met at my lodgings, on morning vi&s;its, two or three different times, when by the greate&s;t good fortune that could happen, Charles luckily called in, and &s;ound them there; the fir&s;t time, he did not &s;eem to mind it; but the &s;econd I &s;aw, made an impre&s;&s;ion on him; and the la&s;t, which was ye&s;terday, they all looked embarra&s;&s;|ed. Hamilton &s;oon took leave; (you mu&s;t know I encouraged an intimacy with him, in hopes it would &s;ome way an&s;wer my purpo&s;e) Charles and Eliza &s;at a while, and then I went home with them, being engaged to pa&s;s the day there.</P>
<P>He continued very &s;erious, and &s;he very badly affected chearfulne&s;s: in the evening, however, we were &s;et a little to rights; two Mi&s;s Boyles, who are fre|quently there, came into tea, which rou&s;ed them from their thoughtfulne&s;s,
<PB N="61" REF="59">and when tea was over, we all went to the Rotunda, where we were joined by Mr. Hamilton; but as he attached him&s;elf to the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Boyle, whom I think he admires, Charles's good humour rather encrea&s;ed; the mu&s;ic too, of which he is very fond, &s;eemed to compo&s;e his &s;pirits, and he went home much ea&s;ier in mind than he had been all day; but as this meeting by chance affects him &s;o much, I &s;hall take the hint, and improve upon it: I cannot now be more explicit as my plan is not thoroughly dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>You a&s;k how I can be &s;o barbarous as to make an amiable girl wretched, who has &s;hewed me &s;uch friend&s;hip? I an|&s;wer, becau&s;e my own happine&s;s is dearer to me than that of any other per&s;on; and as to the civility &s;he has &s;hewn me, &s;he would do the &s;ame to any other &s;tranger that was introduced to her; it is the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the people here, therefore I do not e&s;teem it any particular compliment to me; &s;o my con&s;cience is ea&s;y on that head, and I beg I may have no more of your preaching;
<PB N="62" REF="60">it comes mighty ill from a girl of eigh|teen.</P>
<P>My aunt, you tell me, is much di&s;|plea&s;ed at my expedition; I gue&s;&s;ed &s;he would, which was the rea&s;on I took the opportunity to come off while &s;he was in the country; I was determined, and there was no u&s;e in having an argument upon it. If &s;he knew my purpo&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would come over expre&s;s to prevent it; and if &s;he was not two hun|dred miles from London, and likely to be detained there, till as I hope my bu|&s;ine&s;s will be accompli&s;hed, I would not have given you the &s;malle&s;t item of it; but I caution you to dread the con&s;e|quence of betraying me.</P>
<P>If I can but &s;ucceed, in making a quarrel between Skeffington and his fair cou&s;in, I have no doubt but I &s;hall ea&s;ily obtain her place in his heart, and then you &s;hall&punc; &s;ee how good, how religious, and all that, I will be the re&s;t of my life.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="61">
<P>I wi&s;h I was rid of this Mi&s;s Mor|timer for a while; I think &s;he per|fectly keeps guard over Eliza, and there is no having her to one's &s;elf, long enough to get into her confidence, which I am &s;ure I would have done long &s;ince, if her friend was out of my way; and that would be of great u&s;e to forward my &s;cheme, for I am &s;ure I could draw her into things that would confirm his &s;u&s;picions, if &s;he was without the advice of one who is &s;o well acquainted with her di&s;po&s;i|tion, and &s;o intere&s;ted in her happi|ne&s;s; be&s;ides that, I have rea&s;on to think &s;he &s;u&s;pects my attachment to Skeffington, and is therefore more anxious, to prevent Eliza from being too open in her communications to me; for neither of them has ever dropped the lea&s;t hint of his jealou&s;y: however, I believe all her wi&s;dom and precau|tion, will be in&s;ufficient to ob&s;truct the &s;ucce&s;s of my plan, which I look upon as certain, now that the knowledge
<PB N="64" REF="62">of his temper gives me &s;uch a &s;ure foundation to work upon.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me of Mi&s;s Mortimer's fa|mily, and &s;ituation, and &s;eem won|derfully taken with her character; &s;he is de&s;cended from one of the old|e&s;t families in England, and I think values her&s;elf on her pedigree, though &s;he is at the &s;ame time exceedingly complai&s;ant and affable to every one. Her father and mother are dead; but I &s;uppo&s;e her fortune mu&s;t be quite ea&s;y, &s;ince &s;he has a hou&s;e elegantly furni&s;hed; vi&s;its, and is vi&s;ited by all the fine folks here, and is treated with all that re&s;pect and attention that is u&s;u|ally paid to tho&s;e who are totally in|dependant: in &s;hort, &s;he ranks in the upper cla&s;s of life, but will not be a &s;lave to particular forms, and empty ceremonies, which, &s;he &s;ays, is the very rever&s;e of true politene&s;s; how &s;he manages, I do not know, but every thing &s;he does plea&s;es, and &s;he is &s;et
<PB N="65" REF="63">up as a pattern to all young ladies, as &s;oon as they are brought into com|pany; and as I told you, much ad|mired by the men. To all that I have ever &s;een with her, &s;he behaves with &s;uch perfect equality, that I cannot gue&s;s which of them &s;he pre|fers; yet it is &s;carcely probable that &s;he has not &s;ome attachment: be&s;ides I have heard hints among them that convinces me &s;he has, but I believe there is &s;ome my&s;tery in it, that I cannot fathom; and the ladies here are very re&s;erved on tho&s;e &s;ubjects: I am dying to find it out too, for I &s;hould have great &s;atisfaction in know|ing &s;he had an imprudent intangle|ment; but no matter, I &s;hall tri|umph over her &s;agacity yet, not|with&s;tanding all her endeavours to watch me, for I &s;ee plainly her &s;u&s;|picions of me encrea&s;e.</P>

<P>WHAT poor weak mortals you men are! borne away by every gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and with all your boa&s;ted wi&s;dom, incapable of conducting your|&s;elves with propriety, in the common occurrences of life!&mdash;Any girl ju&s;t e&s;caped from the nur&s;ery, can, if &s;he &s;ets her wits to work, make you believe improbabilities.</P>

<P>Your friend Mr. Skeffington, is flown off to England in a fit of jealou&s;y; and upon the credit of an anonymous &s;crawl he received, has accu&s;ed the &s;weet girl (who&s;e heart he has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from her infancy) of incon&s;tancy, and I know not what non&s;en&s;e.

She lives with her aunt, a Mrs. Vernon, in Jer|myn-&s;treet, and I &s;hould be glad you would keep a watch on the hou&s;e, to &s;ee if he goes or &s;ends there; he has taken Will Lacky with him; the fellow you know is his fo&s;ter-brother, and I am &s;ure has his ma&s;ter's happine&s;s at heart; &s;o if your James could meet with him, I dare &s;ay he would give &s;ome intelligence how he means to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII. MISS MORTIMER, TO THE COUNTESS DE ROUSILLON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 8. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I PROMISED to give my dear Ger|trude, an account of all the occur|rences among us that were worth relating, and I have now to inform you of one that I believe will give you much con|cern; Charles Skeffington departed ab|ruptly for England, four days ago, in a paroxi&s;m of jealou&s;y, which I am certain has been rou&s;ed by the machinations of that Mi&s;s Freeman, of whom I hinted
<PB N="74" REF="72">my &s;u&s;picions in my la&s;t; they are con|firmed by her &s;etting out for England as &s;oon as &s;he found he was gone, on a pretence of being wrote for on material bu&s;ine&s;s, though there had not a packet arrived in the time; for as I &s;u&s;pected her, I &s;ent to enquire.</P>
<P>Eliza bears it &s;urpri&s;ingly; &s;he is hurt by his behaviour, and her pride &s;upports her for the pre&s;ent, but I fear that will not continue long; &s;he is too gentle, and loved him too well, not to regret her di&s;appointment. I do my be&s;t to keep up her re&s;entment, but I know it will not do; tender recollections will obtrude them&s;elves on her mind, and interrupt, if not totally de&s;troy her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Her mother too is greatly to be pitied, for &s;he loved Charles as if he had been her own &s;on, and you cannot imagine how much his pre&s;ent conduct affects her: add to that, &s;he has terrible appre|hen&s;ions for Eliza's health, which indeed,
<PB N="75" REF="73">I think, likely to &s;uffer from the &s;hock &s;he has received.</P>
<P>I &s;hall advi&s;e them to go to Montpel|lier; changing the &s;cene may be of u&s;e to her, and as you mean to leave Paris this month, you will be at Rou&s;illon be|fore they could reach it, and I am &s;ure would contribute all in your power to amu&s;e the dear girl; if I po&s;&s;ibly can, I will accompany them, but that is at pre|&s;ent uncertain.</P>
<P>It is time for me to tell you how the affair happened, at lea&s;t as much as I know of it: I told you in my la&s;t, I was &s;ure Mi&s;s Freeman liked Charles; as I ob&s;erved her clo&s;ely, I was every day more convinced of it, as well as that &s;he mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;cheme in coming over; for which rea&s;on, I gave her as few op|portunities of being alone with Eliza as po&s;&s;ible; for being extremely artle&s;s her|&s;elf, I feared &s;he would be too unre&s;erved, and lay her&s;elf open to the other's cun|ning to take advantage of.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="74">
<P>I was con&s;tantly unea&s;y for her, though I did not know preci&s;ely what to fear; and was much more &s;o when I found Mr. Hamilton and Eliza had met by ac|cident, at Mi&s;s Freeman's lodgings &s;eve|ral times; Charles had found them there, and &s;hewed &s;trong &s;ymptoms of returning jealou&s;y; when Eliza told me what had happened, I mentioned my &s;u&s;picions of Mi&s;s Freeman, and cautioned her to guard again&s;t her artifices, and not to go to her without Charles. She promi&s;ed &s;he would not, but &s;eemed to think I wronged the girl very much, who &s;he &s;aid, was too volatile to manage any deep laid plot. She however look my advice, and &s;eldom went to her, but invited her to their hou&s;e as u&s;ual. Matters were in this way when Mrs. Rochfort got a vio|lent cold which confined her, and you may think I would not leave her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald was al&s;o indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;o that I had not &s;een Eliza for three days, when I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at re|ceiving a note from her at twelve o'clock,
<PB N="77" REF="75">Monday night, reque&s;ting I would go to her immediately, and prepare for &s;taying till morning, as an accident had happen|ed which greatly affected her; to prevent delay &s;he &s;ent the carriage for me.</P>
<P>I &s;hewed the note to Emily, in who&s;e chamber I was &s;itting, begging &s;he would excu&s;e me, if I &s;hould not be at home at breakfa&s;t, and ordering Jenny to put my night cloaths into the chariot, went off, very much alarmed, as both Emily and I had concluded it to be &s;omething relative to Charles.</P>
<P>When I &s;tepped into the hall, the &s;er|vants all looked &s;ad and &s;ilent, Kitty met me, with her eyes quite red from crying, as &s;he was lighting me up &s;tairs, Kitty, &s;aid I, what ails your mi&s;tre&s;s? Oh! ma'am, Mr. Skeffington; and bur&s;ting into tears, was unable to &s;ay more, but conducted me in &s;ilence to Mrs. Fitz|gerald's bed-chamber, who &s;at in her ea&s;y chair weeping.

</LETTER>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, this was calculated to make him &s;uppo&s;e it wrote by &s;ome one in his own family; accordingly his &s;u&s;|picions fell on Kitty, for &s;he &s;ays, when he was quitting the hou&s;e, he called for her, and giving her the letter for Eliza, put five guineas into her hand, &s;aying, he believed he was under an obligation to her; though if her mi&s;tre&s;s confided in
<PB N="83" REF="81">her, &s;he did wrong to betray her &s;ecrets. He forgot he had once endeavoured to tempt her to do the very &s;ame thing, he now di&s;approved. The girl did not know what he meant; &s;he mu&s;t be innocent of it, for &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly tell her mi&s;|tre&s;s would go to the Rotunda, before &s;he knew it her&s;elf: that could only be told by the per&s;on who was determined to take her there.</P>
<P>Having read the letters, I a&s;ked Eliza, had &s;he been at the Rotunda that even|ing? &s;he an&s;wered yes; but begged I would not condemn her, till I heard her &s;tory. She then proceeded to tell me, that in the morning Mi&s;s Freeman had come to breakfa&s;t, as &s;he often did, but would not &s;tay the day, though much pre&s;&s;ed, alledging, &s;he was geting a beautiful fancy trimming on a gown, and mu&s;t go home to &s;hew her maid how to put it on, for &s;he would not let the man|tua-maker do it, le&s;t it &s;hould not be to her ta&s;te; but &s;aid if it was done, &s;he
<PB N="84" REF="82">would come in the evening, as &s;he knew Charles would be out of town.</P>
<P>She left us &s;oon after, and we heard no more of her till &s;ix in the after-noon, Letty came &s;eemingly in a great hurry, with a reque&s;t from her mi&s;tre&s;s, that I &s;hould go drink tea with her; I an&s;wered, &s;he knew I could not leave my mother. Ah, ma'am! &s;he bid me tell you, &s;he is in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, for Mr. Harman is come to tea, and &s;he does not think it prudent to entertain gentlemen at her lodgings, without having &s;ome other lady with her, and &s;he cannot make &s;o free with any one but you, as to expect they would come on &s;uch &s;hort notice.</P>
<P>As Mr. Harman is reputed to be an admirer of Mi&s;s Freeman's, my mother was charmed with her di&s;cretion, and in|&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould go, &s;aying, &s;he was now well enough to amu&s;e her&s;elf by reading. I therefore told the girl, I would follow her as &s;oon as the hor&s;es could be put to,
<PB N="85" REF="83">which I did. Mi&s;s Freeman met me on the &s;tairs, and in her own rattling way, &s;aid I was the be&s;t girl in the world; if I had not come &s;he would have been ruin|ed, for there was two of them with her now; but bid me not &s;ay any thing of being ju&s;t &s;ent for. We had by this time reached the drawing-room, where I found the gentleman already mentioned, and Mr. Hamilton; I would rather he had not been there, but as Charles was not likely to know of it, I was the le&s;s concerned; be it as it would, I would not go away again. We had tea immedi|ately; and a great deal of wit and repar|tee pa&s;&s;ed between Mi&s;s Freeman and her admirer, who &s;eemed to think it in|cumbent on him to follow her lead, and &s;he was remarkable lively, even for her that you know is always &s;o.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden, &s;he propo&s;ed going to the Rotunda, which I readily a&s;&s;ented to, thinking it more eligible than &s;taying at home; the evening was &s;o fine, we agreed to walk, and I ordered the car|riage there at ten. It was very full, and
<PB N="86" REF="84">rather warm, &s;o between the acts we walked in the garden; when we re|turned to the room, Mi&s;s Freeman com|plained of fatigue and thir&s;t; the forms were all filled; but the gentlemen pro|po&s;ed going into a rece&s;s, and having coffee; which &s;he accepted, &s;aying, &s;he was choaked with du&s;t, and we went into one that a &s;et of company had ju&s;t quitted. Coffee and &s;everal other refre&s;h|ments were &s;oon brought, and we were &s;itting making our ob&s;ervations on the variety of figures that were moving in a circle before us, when Mi&s;s Freeman cried in a tone of a&s;toni&s;hment, there is Mr. Skeffington; in&s;tantly he turned his head, and when he &s;aw it was us, &s;tepped in; I &s;aid, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to meet him there, as I did not expect him to town; he an&s;wered, I am &s;ure you did not, and &s;eemed to lay a particular empha&s;is on his words; I hope, &s;ays I, nothing ex|traordinary has happened; yes, madam, &s;aid he, &s;omething very extraordinary.</P>

<P>I was &s;ilent, perceiving at once what he meant, though I could not conceive how he got intelligence of my being there: the gentlemen pre&s;&s;ed him to take coffee, but he declined, &s;aying, he had &s;ome material bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, and had only called in to look for a per|&s;on he had heard was there.</P>
<P>He ca&s;t a look full of indignation at me, and bowing to the company, with|drew, leaving us all looking at each other, as if we did not know whether we &s;hould take notice of his behaviour or not; till Mi&s;s Freeman &s;aid, laughing, &s;he thought we looked as if we had got an|ger, and were afraid to &s;peak.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure Mr. Skeffington's temper was much ruffled at &s;omething, or he would not have behaved &s;o odd: then turning to me, he will make an agreea|ble hu&s;band, my dear, if he has frequent returns of tho&s;e humours.&mdash;I was con|fu&s;ed at her directing the &s;peech to me, but an&s;wered, the woman would de&s;erve
<PB N="88" REF="86">to be unhappy, that knowingly &s;ubjected her&s;elf to &s;uch caprice.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton, whom I &s;aw, gue&s;&s;ed he was the cau&s;e of what had pa&s;&s;ed, looked concerned and &s;erious; but as for me, I was &s;o full of re&s;entment, that it kept up my &s;pirits, and I was deter|mined to &s;peak to him when I came home, and put a final end to the affair; for &s;ince he has no confidence in my af|fection, it is impo&s;&s;ible we could be happy.</P>
<P>It &s;eems he was of the &s;ame &s;enti|ments, for he was gone before I came in. Kitty gave me a letter, &s;aying, Mr. Skeffington left it for me, when he was going away.&mdash;Away where? &s;he an|&s;wered to England, ma'am. I a&s;ked no more que&s;tions, but came to my mother's chamber, who I found &s;o chearful, that I knew &s;he had not heard of it; &s;o I went to my dre&s;&s;ing-room, (as if to undre&s;s) and there I read the letters. I immedi|ately ordered the carriage to go for you,
<PB N="89" REF="87">and then returned to my mother, and broke the matter to her as gently as I could, by telling her of the fir&s;t com|mencement of Charles's jealou&s;y, which I never mentioned before, wi&s;hing to &s;ave her from unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;till hoping a little reflection would cure him of that weakne&s;s; the hope I find was vain, ad|ed &s;he, &s;ighing, but my greate&s;t concern at pre&s;ent is, to &s;ee my mother &s;o much afflicted by his ingratitude. She wanted me to &s;end after him, as he could not have got down to the packet when I came home; but I begged her not to in&s;i&s;t on it, as I never would conde&s;cend &s;o far, to a man, who upon &s;uch &s;light foundation could &s;u&s;pect my &s;incerity; I &s;aid, I thought her right, for it would probably be to no purpo&s;e, &s;ince he did not now &s;eem capable of u&s;ing his rea&s;on; it was therefore better to let him alone, till time and circum&s;tances might open his eyes to conviction.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald agreed with me, &s;aying, &s;he had not con&s;idered the matter properly at fir&s;t. I a&s;ked them
<PB N="90" REF="88">had they no &s;u&s;picion of the author of that letter? Eliza &s;aid, &s;he had no doubt it was Mi&s;s Freeman had it wrote; per|haps by her maid, but the words &s;he was &s;ure were her own, as the &s;tile did not &s;uit the writing and &s;pelling, which were both of the vulgar kind. She &s;aid, &s;he had not a&s;ked any particulars about his going, but would call Kitty now, for &s;he had heard the chariot return &s;ince I came in.</P>
<P>When Kitty came, &s;he was a&s;ked where John had left his ma&s;ter? &s;he an|&s;wered, he had &s;taid to &s;ee him in the wherry, and the &s;ailors &s;aid, the wind was &s;o fair, he would be at the Head to breakfa&s;t. I then a&s;ked her, what had pa&s;&s;ed before he left the hou&s;e; &s;he &s;aid, the &s;ervants told her, for &s;he was not be|low, that he came in &s;oon after nine, which &s;urpri&s;ed them, as they did not expect him that night; he went to his &s;tudy, and called for Will, who found him walking back and forward in great di&s;compo&s;ure; he took no notice of him for &s;ome minutes, then bid him pack up
<PB N="91" REF="89">all his things, with what ha&s;te he cou'd, for he was &s;etting off immediately for England; and Will, if you chu&s;e to come, you may pack up your own things too; but probably I &s;hall not return the&s;e twoor three years, therefore take your choice. Will &s;aid, to be &s;ure he would attend his honour, as long as he would give him leave, and went to do as he was ordered, but fir&s;t &s;tepped into the hall to tell the &s;ervants the news.</P>
<P>Mr. Skeffington came down in about half an hour; de&s;ired one of the men to call me, and when I came, bid me de|liver that letter to my mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he then repeated what he had &s;aid to her; ad|ding, he charged her not to mention his departure to his aunt; her young lady would tell it when &s;he returned. He left directions for Will to follow with the trunks, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and drove off, leaving them all in great con&s;ternati|on; and for her, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had been crying almo&s;t ever &s;ince, for though &s;he did not know directly what the words meant, &s;he gue&s;&s;ed &s;ome mi&s;chief was
<PB N="92" REF="90">between him and her mi&s;tre&s;s, and that he &s;u&s;pected her to be the cau&s;e of it; Eliza bid her not be unea&s;y, for &s;he was convinced of her innocence, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>We all retired to bed &s;oon after, but I cannot &s;ay to re&s;t, for Eliza and I talked over the affair the remainder of the night, which was already far advanced; and I took care to place his treatment of her, in &s;uch a light, as &s;hould rai&s;e her re&s;ent|ment, for I found her &s;everal times in|clined to melt into tears. We determined if Mi&s;s Freeman came next day, to &s;ay Charles was gone to England on bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, and watch her looks and behaviour, to &s;ee if they would confirm our &s;u&s;picions, which in my opinion did not want confirmation, &s;ince it is impo&s;|&s;ible any one but her could know Eliza, and Mr. Hamilton would be at the Ro|tunda together, as it was by her means the thing happened.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="91">
<P>She came as we expected, in the fore|noon, ju&s;t as &s;prightly, and to all appear|ance as thoughtle&s;s as u&s;ual; but &s;he is not what &s;he &s;eems to be in that re&s;pect: &s;he had not &s;at long before &s;he a&s;ked for Charles; and Eliza made the an&s;wer we agreed on; &s;he looked a&s;toni&s;hed; and exclaimed, to England! you quite &s;ur|pri&s;e me. Why &s;hould it &s;urpri&s;e you, &s;ays I, that Mr. Skeffington, who has a large e&s;tate in England, &s;hould have bu|&s;ine&s;s there? &s;he was di&s;concerted at fir&s;t, but recovered quick enough, and replied, becau&s;e ma'am, I thought a certain event, (looking towards Eliza) was to take place &s;o &s;oon, that he would defer every other bu&s;ine&s;s till that was over. Eliza blu&s;h|ed, and was &s;ilent; but I made an&s;wer, Mi&s;s Fitzgerald was in no hurry about that affair. Here the &s;ubject dropped, and we talked of indifferent things till &s;he left us, which &s;he did very &s;hortly, &s;aying, &s;he had a hundred vi&s;its to pay.</P>
<P>I went home to &s;ee Emily, and tell her what had happened, but returned again to &s;tay the day with them; it pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="94" REF="92">over very well, as &s;everal friends had called in to &s;ee Mrs. Fitzgerald, and the Mi&s;s Boyle's came to tea; they always come early, &s;o we had a good deal of time for chat; and I thought it be&s;t to tell them the real truth in regard to Char|les's &s;udden departure, for it will be certainly talked of, and re&s;erve to them was unnece&s;&s;ary. They immediately fixed on Mi&s;s Freeman as the cau&s;e; and I found Mr. Hamilton had told them what pa&s;&s;ed at the gardens. We were &s;till talking it over, and had &s;at down to tea, when Mi&s;s Freeman arrived; &s;he told us, &s;he was come to take leave, for &s;ince &s;he &s;aw us in the morning, &s;he had received a letter with &s;ome news, which made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to go home di|rectly, and &s;he meant to &s;ail in the next packet; we all ca&s;t a look at each other; and I &s;aid, it was a &s;udden call indeed, that put her in &s;uch a hurry; &s;he made no reply to that, but chatted away in her u&s;ual &s;tile about two hours, and then took leave, making a profu&s;ion of ac|knowlegements to Mrs. Fitzgerald, and Eliza, for the many civilities &s;he had re|ceived from them; which provoked me
<PB N="95" REF="93">&s;o much, I could &s;carce forbear giving her a hint of my &s;u&s;picions; but I con|&s;idered it be&s;t, to &s;ay nothing, as it could not an&s;wer any purpo&s;e, &s;ince &s;he certainly would not own it.</P>
<P>After &s;he was gone, we agreed there could be no doubt of what was taking her back; and I mentioned to the Boyle's what had been my opinion of her all along, and my rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>Eliza &s;aid, &s;he would never di&s;pute my penetration again; but &s;he had thought her too giddy to be &s;o de&s;igning. I have wrote to Harry Maun&s;ell an account of Mr. Skeffington's behaviour, and begged him to have a watch on Mi&s;s Freeman, perhaps &s;omething will come out that will be of u&s;e to us, for I think, if his eyes were effectually opened, by a di&s;co|very of her artifice, it would cure him of his foible, and they might yet be happy.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="94">
<P>Mr. Hamilton's marriage with Mi&s;s Boyle, when that takes place, mu&s;t go a good way towards undeceiving him.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzgerald does not abate the lea&s;t bit in his attention to our lovely widow, and &s;he receives them very gra|ciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>When I freed my heart from its fond prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I thought I had done with love, and all its attendant perplexities, but I find I was mi&s;taken, for I am now as much affected with the &s;oft di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my friends, as I could po&s;&s;ibly be with my own; I think rather more &s;o, becau&s;e if any of the follows took &s;uch airs with me, I &s;hould di&s;card them at once, with|out a moment's pain.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. Mr. MAUNSELL, to Mi&s;s MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>June 21. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DEFERED acknowleging the receipt of my dear Mi&s;s Mortimer's favour, till I could give &s;ome &s;atisfactory account of my unhappy friend; unhappy I call him, though I think him blameable, but I mu&s;t feel for him, &s;ince I too well know what he &s;uffers, who lo&s;es all hopes of being united to the object of his fonde&s;t wi&s;hes. But I forget my&s;elf, and am tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing again&s;t your cruel com|mands,
<PB N="99" REF="97">not to mention that &s;ubject, which is, and will ever be neare&s;t my heart; yet &s;urely Loui&s;a, you will par|don me, as you mu&s;t at lea&s;t allow there is &s;ome merit in my endeavours to obey you, when I find the ta&s;k is &s;o difficult.</P>
<P>I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of letting James into the whole &s;ecret, as I &s;hould want his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and have no doubt of his fidelity, I then gave him proper in|&s;tructions, and &s;ent him to Jermyn|&s;treet, where he took a lodging, nearly oppo&s;ite Mrs. Vernon's, &s;o that he mu&s;t &s;ee who went in and out there: it was in the evening, and as his landlady keeps a &s;hop, he bought &s;ome tea, and begged leave to try it in her apartment, and &s;ent for cakes to treat her and the chil|dren; &s;he was much plea&s;ed with his ci|vility, which made her very communi|cative, and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation &s;he gave him the hi&s;tory of every family in the &s;treet, and told him all the genteel female &s;ervants frequented her &s;hop, and often made parties to drink tea there, and be merry, ju&s;t to help her, becau&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="98">&s;he was a poor widow. James reque&s;ted &s;he would introduce him to &s;ome of them, as opportunity offered, which &s;he promi&s;ed; telling him, Mi&s;s Vernon's maid was the prettie&s;t girl in the &s;treet, and &s;he would invite her next evening: it was the very thing he wanted; &s;o giving her to under&s;tand, he would provide the entertainment; he took his leave, telling her he &s;hould &s;leep there next night, and came to inform me of his proceedings.</P>
<P>I was well plea&s;ed at &s;uch a beginning, not doubting but he would &s;o manage matters with the pretty dam&s;el, as to get into the &s;ecrets of the young ladies, &s;o far as would be u&s;eful to us. I &s;ent him next day, that he might watch if Mr. Skeffington went there, and told him I &s;hould not expect to &s;ee him that night again.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="99">
<P>Accordingly, he did not return till morning, when he informed me, he had the greate&s;t hopes of &s;ucceeding to my wi&s;hes; for the girl he had been intro|duced to, was &s;i&s;ter to Mi&s;s Freeman's maid; that &s;he told him, that young lady had met with an accident by the overturning of the carriage, on her road from Ireland, which rendered her unable to travel, and her young lady was to go to her in a day or two, to &s;tay with her till &s;he recovered.</P>
<P>Finding he was an Iri&s;hman, &s;he en|quired if he knew Mrs. Fitzgerald's fa|mily; being an&s;wered in the affirmative, &s;he a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions about them and Charles in a manner that convinces him &s;he knows the whole affair.</P>
<P>I have therefore laid a plan by which I think we &s;hall come at the truth.</P>
<P>James is a well-looking lad, and the girl &s;eemed plea&s;ed with his company; by treating her with a little gallantry, it is
<PB N="102" REF="100">more than probable he will learn all &s;he can tell him. He is already become a favourite, and is frequently with her, for her mi&s;tre&s;s is gone to attend her cou&s;in, who &s;till remains too ill to be moved; and Mrs. Vernon has been out of town &s;ome time, by which means he'll have great opportunities of getting into her con|fidence.</P>
<P>As you gue&s;&s;ed, Charles did not come near me, but I made private enquiries, and found he was at his hou&s;e in Su&s;&s;ex; however, I could get no knowlege of his intentions till ye&s;terday, James luckily met Will Lacky, who had been &s;ent to town on bu&s;ine&s;s; they were rejoiced to &s;ee each other, and &s;tepped into a public hou&s;e to take a gla&s;s; where William told him his ma&s;ter had &s;ome unfortunate mi&s;under&s;tanding with Mi&s;s Fitzgerald, and had left Dublin in a huff, was de|termined not to return this long time, and was now preparing to go abroad, he believed to Germany, and from thence to Italy.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="101">
<P>He lamented greatly what had happen|ed, &s;aying, he was &s;ure the young mi&s;|tre&s;s was not to blame, but his ma&s;ter would not hear rea&s;on.</P>
<P>James expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow on the oc|ca&s;ion, and having obtained a promi&s;e from Will to keep up a con&s;tant cor|re&s;pondence, they parted, and James came to tell what he had heard; and that he propo&s;ed corre&s;ponding, that I might have always intelligence of Mr. Skeffing|ton's movements, which it &s;eems he did not intend to make any of his friends ac|quainted with.</P>
<P>I approved what he had done, and commended him highly for his attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I hope my proceedings will meet the approbation of my lovely Loui&s;a, and obtain her good opinion of one, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="104" REF="102">of that &s;ex, again&s;t which &s;he is &s;o ju&s;tly incen&s;ed by the folly and ingratitude of another.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h your fair friend had &s;ome &s;hare of that fortitude of which you exhibit &s;uch an example on all trying oc|ca&s;ions: indeed, I &s;hould do well to wi&s;h for it my&s;elf too, &s;ince I have even more need of it than Mi&s;s Fitzgerald; becau&s;e it is mo&s;t likely re&s;entment will keep her from repining; but I have not that to &s;upport me, and am, I think, more un|happy than if I had been ill u&s;ed by the woman I adore.</P>
<P>Why will the&s;e ideas perpetually re|cur? I &s;hall not fail to inform you of every thing material that pa&s;&s;es, and have no doubt but matters will yet take a happy turn, if Mr. Hamilton marries Mi&s;s Boyle. Sure that alone will be &s;uf|ficient to convince Charles of his error.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="103">
<P>I will not now give you room to laugh at me by repeating what you have alrea|dy anticipated; &s;o &s;hall only &s;ay, I wi&s;h you may ever retain that charming viva|city which &s;o exceedingly becomes you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>July 1. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TWO days after I wrote to my dear Mi&s;s Mortimer, I received a &s;hort letter from Mr. Skeffington, apologizing for not calling on me, as his mind was in too di&s;tracted a &s;tate &s;ince he came to England, to make him a plea&s;ing com|panion to any one; before that would reach me, he &s;aid, he &s;hould have &s;et off with an intention of quitting the&s;e king|doms,
<PB N="107" REF="105">till the memory of &s;ome late events, which no doubt I had heard of, were &s;o far worn out, as to enable him to return to his own country with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction, when he hoped we &s;hould renew that friend&s;hip which had ever afforded him &s;o much plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>James &s;ame time received a note from William, informing him, they were ju&s;t &s;etting out for Harwick, there to embark for Helvoet&s;luys; and promi&s;ing to write to him from the fir&s;t place, where he &s;hould find they were likely to make any &s;tay: if he keeps his word, we &s;hall not be at a lo&s;s where to find him; and as I am to go to France, I &s;hall certainly make whatever place he is in my way, if he is not lo&s;t to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have now &s;uch a proof as mu&s;t con|vince him the whole plan was laid by Mi&s;s Freeman; but I think it be&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer a-while; as the torments he feels from jealou&s;y, will, when he
<PB N="108" REF="106">finds how groundle&s;s it has been, be the mo&s;t probable means of effecting his cure: and if Mr. Hamilton is married be|fore I leave England, it will be a &s;trong te&s;timony in our favour.&mdash;But to the mo&s;t material point; James conti|nued his vi&s;its to Mrs. Betty, but quit his lodging, informing her, his ma&s;ter was returned from Ireland, where he had &s;aid I went on bu&s;ine&s;s; and that he found I had heard &s;omething very particular about Mr. Skeffington, who &s;he had been &s;peak|ing of, and who was his ma&s;ter's very particular friend.</P>
<P>This rai&s;ed the girl's curio&s;ity, and &s;he made it a point that he &s;hould find out what it was; her young ladies were ex|pected in a few days, and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was de&s;irous of having what intelligence &s;he could again&s;t they came.</P>
<P>James told me what had pa&s;&s;ed, and we agreed he &s;hould not go to her for two or three days; he then paid his vi&s;it with
<PB N="109" REF="107">a face of great concern, and when &s;he que&s;tioned him in regard to what he had heard from me, he evaded an&s;wering, and &s;eemed unwilling to enter on the &s;ub|ject, which made her more anxious to know, till at length he &s;uffered him&s;elf with great difficulty to be prevailed on to tell her, I had by &s;ome means di&s;co|vered that there was mi&s;chief made be|tween Mr. Skeffington and the lady he was going to marry, by a &s;cheme of Mi&s;s Freeman's; that Mr. Skeffington was gone abroad in con&s;equence of it, but he found I was determined to lay the whole matter before Mrs. Vernon, and in&s;i&s;t on her u&s;ing her authority with her daugh|ter, (who he knew was privy to the af|fair) to produce all her cou&s;in's letters from Dublin, by which means he &s;aid, I hoped to effect a reconciliation between the parties concerned; and concluded by &s;aying, he flattered him&s;elf &s;he had no|thing to do in it, for if &s;he had, &s;he would certainly lo&s;e her place, be&s;ides being greatly expo&s;ed, as they all would, who had entered into &s;uch a wicked plot,</P>
<PB N="110" REF="108">
<P>The girl was terrified, and &s;aid it would be the ruin of both her and her young lady, if his ma&s;ter &s;hould acquaint Mrs. Vernon of the affair; though &s;he de|clared, neither of them had any farther to do with it, than by knowing there was &s;uch a plan, and how it was carried on; of which her &s;i&s;ter con&s;tantly inform|ed her by letter, as Mi&s;s Freeman, &s;he was &s;ure, did her mi&s;tre&s;s; for &s;he had often heard her wi&s;h, her cou&s;in had ne|ver gone to Ireland, as &s;he feared it would have bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>She then a&s;ked him, could he think of any way to prevent his ma&s;ter telling Mrs. Vernon; for if it was done, &s;he did not &s;ee how either her mi&s;tre&s;s or &s;he could &s;tand the anger they would get for not di&s;covering it at fir&s;t; for her part, &s;he was determined to run away, though &s;he did not know where to go, &s;ince &s;he had neither father nor mother living,
<PB N="111" REF="109">and mu&s;t earn her own bread; here &s;he cried bitterly, and James affected much unea&s;ine&s;s for her, &s;he pre&s;&s;ing him all the time to think of &s;ome expedient that would &s;ave them from being expo&s;ed to the old lady's wrath.</P>
<P>After much pretended con&s;ideration, he told her he had ju&s;t thought of one, which if &s;he con&s;ented to, he believed would not fail of &s;atisfying me, as all I wanted was to lay open to Mr. Skeffing|ton and Mi&s;s Fitzgerald, the art that had been u&s;ed to &s;eparate them, and if that could be done without applying to Mr. Vernon, he was &s;ure I would at once give that up.</P>
<P>She was earne&s;t to know what &s;he could to do; and he &s;aid, if her &s;i&s;ter's letters to her contained &s;ufficient infor|mation, and that &s;he would part with them, he was certain he could prevent all farther enquiries, and perhaps obtain a reward for her be&s;ides; as he could put
<PB N="112" REF="110">her behaviour in the be&s;t light to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Betty who was mo&s;t hearty, readily complied with his propo&s;al, making no other terms than tho&s;e, that he &s;hould get my promi&s;e never to make the affair known to Mrs. Vernon; for &s;he was &s;ure them letters contained every thing I wi&s;hed to know, and &s;he believed more than Mi&s;s Freeman's.</P>
<P>She delivered a parcel of letters to him, which he brought in triumph to me, mightily elated with his &s;ucce&s;s. I im|mediately &s;at down to examine them, and found a long account of her mi&s;tre&s;s's attachment to Mr. Skeffington, and her Intention to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of creating a quarrel between, him and his intended bride; and &s;ays in one of them, &s;he had di&s;covered by Mi&s;s Fitzgerald's maid, that he had been jealous of a Mr. Hamilton; and her mi&s;tre&s;s had given her a &s;ilk gown for the information: &s;he ob&s;erves, the girl that told her meant no
<PB N="113" REF="111">harm; but &s;he was a &s;imple innocent body, and was not aware of the con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The la&s;t letter is however the mo&s;t material, as it contains the whole plan, which was to be put in execution the day after it was dated, and mentions her having wrote that note, dictated by her mi&s;tre&s;s, that was to be deliver|ed to Mr. Skeffington ju&s;t when he was going out of town.</P>
<P>The whole collection is wretchedly &s;pelt and wrote, &s;o that I could &s;carce decypher &s;ome of them; however as it was the &s;ame hand wrote the anony|mous note which Charles gave &s;uch credit to, I think he mu&s;t believe his own eyes when he compares them to|gether, for I hope that is not de&s;troy|ed.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="112">
<P>I &s;ent the girl a few guineas by James, and my promi&s;e not to mention the tran&s;action except to tho&s;e it con|cerned; for I find by her &s;i&s;ter's letters, &s;he advi&s;ed her not to have any thing to do with &s;uch a wicked &s;cheme, and had great &s;cruples of con&s;cience about it.</P>
<P>The young ladies are come to Town, but Mi&s;s Freeman is confined to her chamber after the journey: the hurt &s;he got was in her head, and the effect will not, (as the &s;urgeons &s;ay) be &s;peedi|ly removed.</P>
<P>She ought to have remained where &s;he was, at lea&s;t a fortnight longer; but her impatience to get home in hopes of finding Charles, was &s;o great, &s;he could not li&s;ten to advice; and &s;he now makes her&s;elf wor&s;e with fretting, le&s;t he &s;hould go from England before &s;he is able to &s;ee him.</P>
<PB N="115" REF="113">
<P>At pre&s;ent &s;he &s;uppo&s;es he is in Su&s;|&s;ex, as Betty tells James, and &s;he on her own account does not pretend to know any thing about him.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly happy in being able to dive &s;o far into this contrivance, as will I think bring matters to a plea&s;ing conclu&s;ion between our friends, at lea&s;t, my endeavours &s;hall not be wanting for &s;uch a de&s;irable purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>I Cannot expre&s;s how much you have obliged me by intere&s;ting your&s;elf &s;o heartily in the affair I mentioned to you; and Eliza to whom I communi|cated your &s;ucce&s;s, is quite a&s;hamed at the trouble you have had, attended with &s;ome expence; &s;he is however a good deal plea&s;ed that the truth will be
<PB N="117" REF="115">brought to light; for though &s;he has not now a thought of marrying Mr. Skeffington, &s;he wi&s;hes to be cleared of the imputation of jilting him; which &s;he looks on, (and &s;o to be &s;ure does every one of common delicacy) as a mo&s;t &s;can|dalous blot in a female character; in|deed I who know every &s;ecret of her heart, can venture to affirm &s;he never had the &s;malle&s;t tendency to any kind of levity.</P>
<P>The anonymous epi&s;tle is &s;afe in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and you will &s;hortly have the happine&s;s of receiving it from my fair hand&mdash;now I know you are overwhelmed with joy and &s;urpri&s;e, and can &s;carce believe you have read it right; but you may, for &s;o it is.</P>
<P>I have promi&s;ed to accompany Mrs. Fitzgerald and Eliza to Montpellier; the late &s;hock they received, has had a bad effect on their &s;pirits, and I ad|vi&s;ed them to this jaunt, but they would
<PB N="118" REF="116">not go without me; &s;o I have con&s;ent|ed to be of the party; for be&s;ide the plea&s;ure I &s;hall have in being with them, I long to &s;ee Gertrude, and I know &s;he and her agreeable Count are now at Rou&s;&s;illon; I &s;hall write by this po&s;t to inform her of our intention, and get her to &s;ecure accommodations for us in the town.</P>
<P>Now I mention that, will you be &s;o good to take a lodging for us for a week, again&s;t we reach London, where we &s;top merely to re&s;t, for this is not a &s;ea&s;on for making any &s;tay there: two floors will do us.</P>
<P>We mean to &s;et out in two days, and will go to you when we arrive, to know where you have fixed us.</P>
<P>But pray now moderate your tran&s;|ports, when we meet; for po&s;itively tho&s;e raptures, which were pretty enough

<P>I Believe my dear Gertrude will hear with plea&s;ure that I &s;hall &s;et out in two days from this date on my way to Montpellier, in company with Mrs. Fitzgerald and Eliza, whom I have pre|vailed on to take the journey, which
<PB N="121" REF="119">I hope will recruit both their health and &s;pirits, at pre&s;ent very much affected by Mr. Skeffington's beha|viour.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t trouble you to &s;ecure apart|ments for us in the mo&s;t agreeable part of the town; our family will con&s;i&s;t of our&s;elves, Eliza's waiting dam&s;el, and mine, one man &s;ervant we take with us, and we mu&s;t certainly get a French valet de chambre for the time we &s;tay, &s;o you will provide accommodations ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald does not take her woman, becau&s;e &s;he has her town hou&s;e|keeper, and being a tru&s;ty body, can be depended on to take charge of every thing in the hou&s;e, and the furni|ture you know is very valuable; therefore Eliza's maid is to &s;upply her place.</P>
<PB N="122" REF="120">
<P>I know you would wi&s;h to have us at the Chateau; but it will be more agree|able to Mrs. Fitzgerald to have a lodg|ing in the town; be&s;ides there is too many of us to go to you, who are not in a hou&s;e of your own; however, as we &s;hall be &s;o near you, we can be every day together.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Freeman was, as I &s;u&s;pected, the author of all the di&s;turbances I men|tioned to you in my la&s;t: Harry Maun|&s;ell has letters in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that prove it pa&s;t contradiction; how he came by them is (in the language of auction bills) too tedious to in&s;ert, as I have &s;till &s;everal little things to do pre|paratory to my journey; but the &s;tory will &s;erve us for conver&s;ation when we are traver&s;ing the &s;hady walks of Rou&s;|&s;illon together, which I hope we &s;oon &s;hall.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="121">
<P>We mean to go through Holland, and make as little delay on the road as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of Augu&s;t is fixed for the marriage of Mr. Hamilton and Mi&s;s Boyle; they are to &s;et off for Belle Park next day, where they make a &s;hort &s;tay, and then go to Hamilton Hall for the remainder of the &s;ummer, but will be in town every winter: he has taken an elegant hou&s;e in Merrion|&s;quare: they will be an amiable couple, and I am plea&s;ed on every account they are to be &s;o &s;oon married.</P>
<P>Mrs. Herbert informs me her &s;i&s;ter-in-law is ju&s;t on the eve of matrimony with a young man of large fortune in that country; Patty is very happy on the occa&s;ion, as &s;he feared her brother
<PB N="124" REF="122">would ab&s;ent him&s;elf a good deal from her hou&s;e while Mi&s;s Herbert remained &s;ingle; for as he knew her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favor, and could not return it, it certainly would not be agree|able to him to be much in her com|pany, and &s;he was frequently at her brother's.</P>
<P>Patty tells me Mr. Herbert is deter|mined to come to Dublin in about a year, their elde&s;t girl will by that time want proper ma&s;ters, and he is &s;o fond of her, he cannot bear &s;ending her to a boarding-&s;chool, nor does &s;he much like that mode of education if it can be avoided; &s;he chu&s;es to have her daugh|ters under her own eye; but Mr. Herbert is &s;o fond of the country, &s;he feared he would never con&s;ent to liv|ing for any time in town; but to her great joy he made the propo&s;al him&s;elf.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="123">
<P>they have got a large addition to their fortune by the death of a di&s;tant rela|tion.</P>
<P>How happy &s;hall I be to have this dear companion of my childhood &s;et|tled near me once more; for to be &s;ure, on the child's account, they'll &s;tay in town at lea&s;t &s;ix or eight months in the year.</P>
<P>Emily left me ye&s;terday; &s;he is gone with her father and mother to the coun|try, but they will all return early in the winter: Mr. O'Neil has taken a hou&s;e, &s;o Mrs. Rochfort mu&s;t be there when next &s;he comes to Dublin; but I fancy it won't be for any long time, as matters between her and Mr. Fitz|gerald are, I find, mo&s;t likely to be concluded to the &s;atisfaction of all par|ties, her father being quite content.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. MISS MORTIMER TO MRS. ROCHFORT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Montpellier, Aug. 14 &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am per&s;uaded my dear Emily is anxious to hear of our &s;afe arrival, I &s;eize the fir&s;t lei&s;ure moment that has offered to inform you we per|formed our journey &s;urpri&s;ingly well, and Mrs. Fitzgerald bore it to a mira|cle, &s;carce complaining of fatigue till the la&s;t day or two: We made but three days &s;tay in London, for as &s;he found her&s;elf quite able to proceed,
<PB N="128" REF="126">there was no occa&s;ion for delay, nor did we &s;top longer than was nece&s;&s;ary among&s;t the high and mighty Lords, &s;o could make no material ob&s;ervations on the people, except tho&s;e obvious ones of their cleanline&s;s and indu&s;try, which are thread-bare themes, they have been &s;o often expatiated on al|ready.</P>
<P>I think indeed they excel their En|gli&s;h neighbours in both tho&s;e quali|ties; as for the former, they are down|right &s;laves to it, &s;ince they debar them|&s;elves the u&s;e of their rooms for fear of dirtying them; which is carrying the point to exce&s;s, and exce&s;&s;es even in virtue border on vice.</P>
<P>We have been here &s;ome days, and are &s;ettled very agreeably in the mid&s;t too of acquaintances, for here are &s;e|veral of our country people that we had &s;ome knowledge of, who paid us their compliments as &s;oon as we were known
<PB N="129" REF="127">to be here, and we are now quite &s;o|ciable.</P>
<P>Gertrude, though prepared by my letter to expect us, was very near faint|ing when we met, her joy &s;o far over|came her. She is &s;omewhat increa&s;ed in &s;ize &s;ince you &s;aw her, and is nearly as much a&s;hamed of it as if &s;he was not married; it is &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;he has not conquered her ba&s;hfulne&s;s in this country, where I believe &s;he is her&s;elf the only example of it; but &s;he &s;eems not one bit altered in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Count's affection is, I think, rather warmer than before &s;he was his wife, and &s;he &s;ays all his family treat her with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, &s;o that I have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing her happy; only &s;he now and then wi&s;hes to be in Ireland among&s;t her own friends, but as &s;he will come over &s;ome times to &s;ee us all, and will al&s;o &s;ee many of them here at times, &s;he will
<PB N="130" REF="128">by degrees be reconciled to the nece&s;&s;i|ty of living in France.</P>
<P>Next to my own country it is the place I would chu&s;e; the di&s;po&s;ition of the people here being very like the Iri&s;h in kindne&s;s and attention to &s;trang|ers; and if their pre&s;ent Monarch goes on as he has begun, they bid fair to be re&s;tored to their natural rights, liberty I mean; for he is daily loo&s;ening the bands of oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery; while our Rulers are only &s;tudying how to rivet the chains with which they have been loading the people as long as I can remember.</P>
<P>Poor Eliza tries to be chearful, but her heart revolts again&s;t the attempt, and it does but make the &s;ettled languor that has over&s;pread her countenance more vi&s;ible; her forced &s;miles make my heart ach, and bring the tears into her mother's eyes, who anxiou&s;ly watches every turn of her features.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="129">
<P>I grieve that the dear girl cannot combat her tenderne&s;s for one who, I fear, would never make her happy, but I am not &s;urprized at it, for in a temper &s;o gentle as hers, that cannot long harbour re&s;entment, one might expect ill u&s;age would have ju&s;t the effect it appears to have on her; you know it was what I feared, and was the the rea&s;on I wi&s;hed &s;he would change the &s;cene; as every object at home would revive &s;ome idea it was nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;he &s;hould forget.</P>
<P>I am in hopes that time, and the agreeable variety &s;he meets with here, will in &s;ome degree re&s;tore her peace.</P>
<P>The letters Mr. Maun&s;ell has are exactly in the &s;ame hand as the anony|mous one &s;ent to Charles; therefore he mu&s;t be convinced, when he &s;ees them; but unle&s;s it could make an ab&s;olute change in his di&s;po&s;ition, I would never
<PB N="132" REF="130">advi&s;e her to marry him; for a jealous hu&s;band would be mi&s;ery indeed.</P>
<P>Well, and how goes on your affair? Do you &s;till keep up that matronly gravity with which you u&s;ed to receive Mr. Fitzgerald's attentions? for I dare &s;ay he has paid you a vi&s;it in the coun|try before now; do tell me all about it, that I may amu&s;e Eliza with the reci|tal. &mdash;You &s;hall hear &s;oon from me again; mean time, believe me,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>Augu&s;t 30.&mdash;</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Emily,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of yours within the&s;e few days; and am much ob|liged to you for writing, without wait|ing to hear from me; there is how|ever a letter of mine on its way to you, which I &s;uppo&s;e you will &s;oon receive, and which contains an ac|count
<PB N="134" REF="132">of our health, and &s;o forth, I am &s;orry I cannot tell you that Eliza is better, but indeed I cannot as yet perceive the lea&s;t amendment, tho' I do not think &s;he is any thing wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald has received great benefit from the air and exerci&s;e &s;he takes here, if Eliza was well I believe her mother wou'd have no com|plaint.</P>
<P>I hope little Emily is quite reco|vered from the &s;mall-pox, and con|gratulate you on her having it &s;o fa|vourably, and while &s;he is &s;o young; it is be&s;t early, let the event be what it will: for if they recover, there is a deal of anxiety over; but if it plea|&s;es Heaven to take them, the affliction cannot be &s;o heavy for an infant, as if they were taken from us at a later period of their lives.</P>
<PB N="135" REF="133">
<P>I had ye&s;terday a letter from Henry Maun&s;ell; he tells me Mi&s;s Freeman's health is in a mo&s;t dangerous &s;tate; &s;he was pretty well, and &s;ent down to Su&s;&s;ex to enquire about Charles, but when &s;he received for an&s;wer that he was gone abroad, di&s;appointment and vexation, threw her into violent hy&s;|teric fits, which continued, with &s;hort intermi&s;&s;ions, for two days, and have left her &s;o weak and low that the phi|&s;icians apprehended a galloping con|&s;umption will be the con&s;equence, as medicine &s;eems to have little or no effect; to be &s;ure it cannot have much, as the cau&s;e of her di&s;order lies in her mind, and not likely to be removed.</P>
<P>What a dreadful thing it is to be governed &s;o ab&s;olutely by our pa&s;&s;i|ons; for it brings on the wor&s;t kind of bodily complaints, which one would think &s;ufficient to deter people from giving the reigns to their head&s;trong
<PB N="136" REF="134">inclinations, &s;uppo&s;ing they have no regard to religious precepts, which however ought to be the fir&s;t motive with a chri&s;tian to correct the wild &s;allies of an impetuous di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Nature had been liberal of her en|dowments to Mi&s;s Freeman, both as to per&s;on and under&s;tanding, which had &s;he made a proper u&s;e of, would have enabled her to make a plea&s;ing, if not a &s;hining figure, in life; but by for&s;aking the path of moral rec|titude, &s;he has lo&s;t both her health and her peace; the gentle heart of Eliza is grieved for her, tho' &s;he is her&s;elf &s;uffering from the unhappy girl's mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>You cannot form an idea of any thing more beautiful than the &s;itua|tion and improvements of Rou&s;&s;illon; I think the very air that blows there in&s;pires one with the &s;ofte&s;t, mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;erenity imaginable, and I am
<PB N="137" REF="135">not at all &s;urpri&s;ed that Gertrude &s;hould learn to love, and even be prevailed on to acknowledge it, in the&s;e de|lightful bowers; for doubtle&s;s external objects operate powerfully on the di&s;|po&s;ition of the mind; e&s;pecially of Women.</P>
<P>Place a pair of lovers on a barren rock, the wind and &s;ea roaring round them, and I think the dreary pro&s;|pect would extingui&s;h every wi&s;h but that of finding &s;helter from the jar|ring elements; at lea&s;t I will venture to an&s;wer for the dam&s;el, that the tendere&s;t eloquence would be lo&s;t on her in &s;uch a place; but change the &s;cene, and place them in a blooming arbour, a gentle rivulet murmuring by, and all nature &s;miling round them, there let him tell his &s;oft tale, and I think he need not doubt a kind reception; for me, I am &s;o convinced of it, that I am arming my heart with all its in&s;en&s;ibility again&s;t Harry Maun&s;ell comes; for I think it will
<PB N="138" REF="136">require no &s;mall degree of &s;toici&s;m, to remain unmoved by the &s;oft lan|guage of his &s;peaking eyes, joined to the love-in&s;piring &s;cene around me.</P>
<P>I fear if I was not fully prepared for the danger, I &s;hould, forgetful of my promi&s;e, and even of my own di&s;inclination to matrimony, &s;tep to the next church and pre&s;ent him with my fair hand.</P>
<P>I think I hear you &s;ay, this girl's pen runs fa&s;ter than her wit; but con&s;ider child, tho' I rattle a great deal, there is many a true word&mdash; pardon me, I had like to write a whole proverb, in defiance of Lord Che&s;terfield.</P>
<P>The old Compte and Compte&s;e and their daughters arrived at the Chat|teau four days &s;ince; their &s;on-in-law is to follow &s;oon; they are mo&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="137">agreeable people; as for Madame St. Variolle I am quite charmed with her; and delighted to &s;ee the tender friend|&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between her and Gertrude; &s;he is exceeding &s;prightly, but does not give into the gallantry that is u&s;ually practi&s;ed here; I mean, &s;he does not encourage any particu|lar gentleman to attend her; as to the men in general, the cu&s;tom of the country permits a degree of fa|miliarity with them, that appears odd to us, who&s;e manners are more re&s;erved; it would throw us into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion to have our male vi&s;itors u&s;hered into our bedchambers before we were up, or to our toilet, while we were dre&s;&s;ing: yet &s;o powerful is cu&s;tom; it is done here without the lea&s;t idea of indelicacy by women who, I am convinced, are as perfect|ly virtuous as any woman in Ireland; and that I think is &s;aying every thing for them: even among&s;t tho&s;e married ladies who fall in with the fa&s;hion of having a particular admirer, (which mo&s;t of them do) I am &s;atisfied the
<PB N="140" REF="138">greater number of them are as cha&s;te as Lucretia~.</P>
<P>I know &s;everal of them, who from the ju&s;tne&s;s of their &s;entiments, and the whole tenor of their conduct, I am per&s;uaded, would not deviate from the right path, in &s;o material a point; be it as it may, they are more refined in their gallantry than the Engli&s;h ladies, who are gro&s;s enough to &s;toop &s;o low as their footmen and grooms, of which we have had &s;everal in&s;tances within the&s;e few years.</P>
<P>Gertrude cannot be brought to comply with any of the cu&s;toms I have mentioned, and is a good deal rallied for her ba&s;hfulne&s;s, even by the Compte: I dare &s;ay, &s;he will in a while admit gentlemen to her toi|let; it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it, without being impolite and &s;in|gular.</P>
<PB N="141" REF="139">
<P>We have thoughts of taking a trip to Paris, that is Eliza and I, accom|panied by Gertrude and her Lord, and Madame St. Veriolle, who has invited us to her hou&s;e, and was in|deed the fir&s;t propo&s;er of the jaunt; I had it in contemplation before, as a thing that would amu&s;e Eliza, but had not mentioned it: &s;he &s;eemed plea&s;ed when it was &s;poke of, and Mrs. Fitzgerald con&s;ented at once; &s;aying, &s;he could never want company, there were &s;o many of our acquain|tances in town.</P>
<P>I fancy we &s;hall &s;et out in day or two; our &s;tay will not be very long; &s;o you need not expect to hear from me again, till after we return'; by that time, perhaps, I &s;hall have &s;ome intere&s;ting intelligence from Henry, who I imagine is ere now on his way to Geneva, where he was in|formed Charles meant to make &s;ome &s;tay.</P>
<PB N="142" REF="140">
<P>We are going to dine at Rou&s;&s;il|lon, and I am yet to dre&s;s; I &s;hall therefore bid you farewell, for I mu&s;t take a little more time than u&s;ual, to make my&s;elf very lovely, as there are to be three or four young Dukes, and as many Marqui&s;&s;es (no|thing under to be met with here, who are all candidates for my fa|vour.</P>
<P>Do you know that I am the admiration of the French Men quite eclip&s;e Eliza, who is acknow|ledged to be infinitely hand&s;omer; they &s;ay, if &s;he had Mi&s;s Morti|mer's vivacity, &s;he would be but too charming; indeed I wi&s;h I could give her a little chearfulne&s;s; I would willingly &s;hare my conque&s;ts with her, if that would blot Charles from her memory&mdash;but it will not be.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Emily,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Sudden illne&s;s which attacked Mrs. Fizgerald put a &s;top to our intended jaunt to Paris; for though &s;he was well again in two days, we would not venture to leave her, as from the &s;ymptoms we fear|ed it was the gout in her &s;tomach, which might return, and we could not have enjoyed our&s;elves under that
<PB N="145" REF="143">apprehen&s;ion, if we were three hun|dred and fifty miles from her: we there|fore contented our&s;elves with mak|ing &s;hort excur&s;ions of two or three leagues, and have vi&s;ited &s;everal of the nobility and gentry, who are re|lations or friends of the Rou&s;&s;illon fa|mily, and were every where received with that plea&s;ing attention and po|litene&s;s, for which this nation is di&s;|tingui&s;hed, and which makes it &s;uch an agreeable re&s;idence for &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The adjacent country is very de|lightful; but not near &s;o populous as England or Ireland; it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould, if we con&s;ider the thou|&s;ands of both &s;exes that are buried in Convents; be&s;ides their clergy be|ing condemned to perpetual celi|bacy.</P>
<P>I will not di&s;pute about the piety of &s;hutting up their youth from the world, though, in my opinion, our
<PB N="146" REF="144">duty to God does not con&s;i&s;t in &s;e|cluding our&s;elves from &s;ociety; but putting religion out of the que&s;tion, it is certainly the mo&s;t impolitic cu&s;|tom, that was ever allowed by any government, &s;ince it mu&s;t depopu|late, and con&s;equently impoveri&s;h the country.</P>
<P>Spain and Portugal, where this reli|gious phrenzy is carried to the highe&s;t exce&s;s, are melancholy proofs of it, for at lea&s;t half of each kingdom lies un|cultivated and uninhabited, while their convents and mona&s;teries are crammed with people, who, were they exerci&s;ing their different talents in the world, might be u&s;eful members of the com|munity.</P>
<P>France is not &s;o bad in this re&s;pect, as there are &s;ome bounds &s;et here to &s;u|per&s;tition, and I think &s;ome limitation to the number of tho&s;e hou&s;es; they begin to &s;ee how de&s;tructive the&s;e in&s;ti|tutions
<PB N="147" REF="145">are to the pro&s;perity of the king|dom in general.</P>
<P>I have given you a di&s;&s;ertation upon Convents, as it is a &s;ubject England or Ireland does not afford us, and I thought you would expect &s;omething new from France.</P>
<P>I have had a letter from Harry Maun&s;ell; he is yet at Geneva, and ledged at the &s;ame hou&s;e with Mr. Ske&s;&s;ington.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night he arrived he &s;tayed at the hou&s;e where he &s;et up; but you &s;hall have it in his own words as fol|lows:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I went next day to a Coffee-hou&s;e, where I thought it likely I &s;hould meet him: He was not there when fir&s;t I went,
<PB N="148" REF="146">but there were &s;everal Gentlemen of the town, with whom I had been acquaint|ed when on my travels, who all came up to compliment me, and I had been conver&s;ing with them about half an hour, when Charles came in; his coun|tenance &s;hewed his mind was not at ea&s;e, for he appeared pale and languid, and much altered for the wor&s;e &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw him. He &s;poke to &s;ome Gentle|men near him, and then took a &s;eat, without once perceiving me, and &s;eem|ed &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that when I went up to him, the &s;ound of my voice made him &s;tart.</P>
<P>He however expre&s;&s;ed great plea|&s;ure at &s;eeing me, and a&s;ked was I go|ing to Montpellier, as he knew I in|tended? Having an&s;wered him in the affirmative, he &s;aid he &s;hould be glad to accompany me, if I would wait till he got letters from England.</P>
<PB N="149" REF="147">
<P>You may gue&s;s this propo&s;al was in&s;tantly complied with on my part, as he could not have made a more agreeable offer.</P>
<P>At his reque&s;t I then walked to his lodgings, and as we went he apo|logized for leaving England without &s;eeing me, &s;aying, he was at that time in a &s;ituation of mind not to be de|&s;cribed; he was now better, and hoped time and proper reflexion would re|&s;tore his peace; but added, &s;ighing, it is hard to break the cord of affection that has been for years twining it&s;elf round the heart; I believe, Harry, that is a truth your own feelings will make you acknowledge. He touched a ten|der &s;tring; I too &s;ighed a&s;&s;ent to his ob&s;ervation, and the ideas it rai&s;ed kept us both &s;ilent till we were &s;eated in his apartments.</P>
<P>He then in&s;i&s;ted I &s;hould dine with him; and &s;aid if I was not al|ready
<PB N="150" REF="148">fixed, I could be accommodat|ed in that hou&s;e, and it would make him very happy.</P>
<P>I &s;oon agreed about it, and &s;end|ing James with my Trunks, took im|mediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my chambers.</P>
<P>In the evening we went out to pay &s;ome vi&s;its, and did not return until late, &s;o that nothing farther pa&s;&s;ed that night on the material &s;ubject; but I determined to intro|duce it the fir&s;t convenient offer he gave me, as I thought it nece&s;&s;ary the af|fair &s;hould be thouroghly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before he and Mi&s;s Fitzgerald met.</P>
<P>But I do not mean to tell him &s;he is at Montpellier; &s;hame would certainly prevent his going there, for he has declared he never can bear to &s;ee her, after the unpardonable
<PB N="151" REF="149">folly he has been guilty of, as he cannot expect forgivene&s;s&punc;</P>
<P>I had &s;oon an opportunity of en|tering on the &s;ubject, by his men|tioning Mi&s;s Freeman.</P>
<P>You are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a happy in|&s;en&s;ibility, Charles, &s;aid I, that can &s;peak with &s;o much indifference of a woman that is dying for you.</P>
<P>He looked very &s;erious, and &s;aid, he was not now in a di&s;po&s;ition for joking: I a&s;&s;ured him I did not mean it as a joke, then replied he, excu&s;e me Mr. Maun&s;ell, if I di&s;approve of your &s;eriou&s;ly affirming &s;uch an in|delicate &s;tory of a young lady I highly e&s;teem; though I am not coxcomb enough to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he loves me.&mdash;If, an&s;wered I, you really did not &s;ee her partiality to you, which I find other people did, I am
<PB N="152" REF="150">not &s;urpri&s;ed you &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;|ed at my mentioning it, as a wo|man's delicacy ought to be &s;acred; but when &s;he her&s;elf departs from it, and goes &s;uch unwarrantable lengths to gratify her pa&s;&s;ion, &s;urely &s;he has no right to expect others will &s;peak of her with much tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>He looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;aying, he did by no means comprehend me, begged I would explain my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I immediately went for a &s;mall box, in which I kept the letters, and lay|ing it on the table, told him, he would find in that a full explanation of the matter, and al&s;o of &s;ome di&s;a|greeable circum&s;tances, which I be|lieved would appear to him in a quite different light, after he had read tho&s;e papers, from what they had done.</P>
<PB N="153" REF="151">
<P>Being engaged for the evening, I left him to peru&s;e them at his lei&s;ure, and make his own reflections on them.</P>
<P>I did not return until late, &s;o went directly to my chamber, though James told me, Mr. Sheffington was not in bed, but had been walking about his room for &s;ome time, as if under an agitation; but as that was not an hour to enter on the topic, I retired to re&s;t, and did not &s;ee him until we met at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>He looked embarra&s;&s;ed, and con|tinued &s;ilent, &s;eemingly at a lo&s;s how to begin the &s;ubject, until I led the way, by a&s;king, had he looked over the letters? he replied, I have, and am a&s;hamed of my own folly and in|gratitude in affronting, by my unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, the &s;weet girl who was in|capable of giving me any real cau&s;e for them, though I have been &s;o in|du&s;trious
<PB N="154" REF="152">in &s;eeking out imaginary ones; but, &s;aid he, I have &s;uffered &s;e|verely for it, and &s;hall continue to &s;uffer even more from reflecting on the happine&s;s I have wantonly flung from me.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed a hope that matters might &s;till be made up between him and Mi&s;s Fitzgerald; but he declared he could never bring him&s;elf to ap|pear before her; or if he did, to what purpo&s;e would it be, for though the gen|tlene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition might prevent her harbouring any violent re&s;entment again&s;t him, yet he could not expect &s;he would hazard her peace by unit|ing her&s;elf to a man who had given &s;uch proofs of a jealous temper; for notwith&s;tanding I feel my&s;elf perfectly cured of that foible, how &s;hall I con|vince her that it would not break out again: No, Maun&s;ell, &s;he never can &s;o far forget the unkind treatment &s;he has met with from me; and I mu&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="153">bid adieu to all the felicity I once promi&s;ed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He cea&s;ed &s;peaking, and was &s;o much affected, that I was moved at his affliction, e&s;pecially as I thought his fears were well founded, and that it is very probable, though Mi&s;s Fitz|gerald may pit and forgive, &s;he will not marry him; unle&s;s &s;he can be brought to believe, (as I really do) that he will never again yield to a pa&s;&s;ion which cau&s;ed him &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was not for &s;ome time that he thought of a&s;king how I came po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e letters? I told him James had &s;ome how got acquainted with Mi&s;s Vernon's Maid, who let him into the &s;ecret, and he knowing how much I was intere&s;ted for your happine&s;s, per&s;uaded her to give him the&s;e papers, which would lay the whole &s;cheme open; but I mu&s;t tell
<PB N="156" REF="154">you, Charles, your friends &s;aw at fir&s;t there was a plot in it, and as Mi&s;s Freeman immediately followed you to England, concluded it was concerted between you; till your going abroad, and the intelligence James gave me of the effect it had on the lady's health, convinced us, it was all her own con|trivance.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had no right to com|plain of our &s;u&s;picions, &s;ince he mu&s;t own appearances were much again&s;t him, e&s;pecially to Eliza, who was con|&s;cious of her own innocence.</P>
<P>I took occa&s;ion from thence to preach to him on the folly of tru&s;t|ing to appearances, and not giving our own rea&s;on fair play; it was that ha&s;|tine&s;s in judging had cau&s;ed all this mi&s;under&s;tanding, and interrupted his own peace as well as that of his deare&s;t friends.</P>
<PB N="157" REF="155">
<P>He acknowledged the ju&s;tice of my ob&s;ervation, and &s;aid, he was &s;o perfectly &s;en&s;ible of his error, that he hoped he was quite &s;ecure from falling into it again.</P>
<P>Indeed I hope and believe &s;o too; if my Loui&s;a &s;hould be of that opi|nion, will &s;he not become his advo|cate with her fair friend? I have &s;ince told him all I had heard of the ac|cident Mi&s;s Freeman met with on the road, and the very precarious &s;tate &s;he is now in; for when I left England there was very little hopes of her: but I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to tell him it was I employed James to dive into the affair, &s;ince he did not &s;eem to &s;u&s;pect it.</P>
<P>He made &s;ome pertinent remarks on the impropriety of the young lady's conduct, as well as her ingratitude to his
<PB N="158" REF="156">Eliza, who had &s;hewn her &s;o much friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>We are now only waiting for the letters he expects from England, which I hope will not detain us much longer; as I have the utmo&s;t impatience till I again view that enchanting face, and hear the mu&s;ic of tho&s;e accents, which vibrate to my heart, and cau&s;e &s;uch plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, as none but tho&s;e who love as I do can feel."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>So far Harry Maun&s;ell; you &s;ee I have given you the conclu&s;ion of his epi&s;tle, lea&s;t you &s;hould imagine he was &s;o &s;tupid as not to be affected by our approaching meeting, or &s;o impo|lite as not to tell me &s;o:&mdash;Be&s;ides, I know young widows like to hear &s;oft non&s;en&s;e, whether &s;aid to them&s;elves or others; not but I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;ufficient entertainment of that &s;ort from your own &s;wain, now that all impedi|ments are removed.</P>
<PB N="159" REF="157">
<P>I charge you do not think of marry|ing till I return, for I intend the &s;ame day &s;hall &s;erve for you and Eliza, and then I can perform the part of bride-maid to you both; as I fore&s;ee my me|diation will not be nece&s;&s;ary to bring about a reconciliation in that quarter.</P>
<P>Harry knows little of the matter, if he thinks his friend has need of an ad|vocate; but I do not mean to tell him &s;o; for it gives the&s;e men &s;uch con&s;e|quence in their own eyes, when they find their influence is &s;o powerful over our fond hearts.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of pleading for the offender, I am endeavouring to fortify Eliza with re&s;olution to keep up &s;ome degree of dignity on their meeting, and to take at lea&s;t a few days before &s;he &s;uffers her&s;elf to be per&s;uaded to &s;ign his ab&s;o|lute pardon.</P>
<PB N="160" REF="158">
<P>But I fear all my good le&s;&s;ons will be forgot, when the loved youth appears; unle&s;s the &s;en&s;e of his own demerits may make him too humble to a&s;k a compleat re&s;toration to her favour.</P>
<P>Harry's letter threw her into the prettie&s;t agitation imaginable, when &s;he found they were coming to Montpel|lier; but the idea of Charles's &s;uffer|ings melted her to tears; in &s;hort, &s;he was quite fluttered, and affected a hun|dred different ways; but that I am not &s;urprized at, for her mother was not much better, though the affection &s;he bears him is only that of a parent, while her daughter's are of a much ten|derer kind.</P>
<P>Her health mends apace, and her countenance begins to wear its u&s;ual &s;erenity; even the country &s;eems to have new beauties for her; at lea&s;t &s;he
<PB N="161" REF="159">had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed them over unnotic|ed; &s;o true is that line of the &s;ong,</P>
<Q><L>" We only can ta&s;te when the heart is ea&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>Well, the&s;e &s;en&s;itive plants may boa&s;t of their exqui&s;ite feelings, but for me, I am content to be only moderately happy, on condition of never being &s;upremely mi&s;erable; and for that pur|po&s;e took pains to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e violent &s;en&s;ibilities that would not be controuled by rea&s;on, and are therefore always dangerous, and frequently fatal, to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them.</P>
<P>A letter from Harriet Boyle to Eliza, informs her of her &s;i&s;ter's nuptials with Mr. Hamilton; I wonder how Charles will look when he hears of it; for Har|ry does not &s;ay he had mentioned any thing of that to him.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="160">
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald begins to long for home; however we &s;hall not leave this for &s;ome time yet; it would be fooli&s;h to make &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay, after &s;o long a journey.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not write to you again till I can inform you how matters are accom|modated between Charles and Eliza.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LI. MISS MORTIMER TO MRS. ROCHFORT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>Sept. 28. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;ure my dear Emily will be full of impatience to know how our lovers quarrel has ended; why, as all love quarrels do end; in an encrea&s;ed affection for each other.</P>
<P>As I foretold, &s;he &s;igned an act of oblivion, as &s;oon as he could a&s;&s;ume re&s;olution enough to a&s;k it, which was
<PB N="164" REF="162">not for two days, &s;uch a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e had he of his high crimes and mi&s;de|meanors.</P>
<P>I am provoked that &s;he could think more lightly of them than he did; I would have taken one little week's be|&s;eeching, at lea&s;t, before I would have &s;uffered my&s;elf to be prevailed on; a pardon &s;o ea&s;ily obtained may encou|rage him to farther tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; but Eliza has no art, and as her heart for|gave, &s;he could not keep her tongue from acknowledging it: to tell truth, I believe &s;he will have no cau&s;e to re|pent; for he &s;eems &s;o perfectly con|vinced of his fault, that I think it im|po&s;&s;ible he can ever fall into it again&mdash; But I mu&s;t tell you how matters were conducted to bring them together.</P>
<P>Harry never gave the &s;malle&s;t hint of our being here, and contrived not to come in till night, lea&s;t they &s;hould by any accident meet us or our &s;er|vants;
<PB N="165" REF="163">he then made &s;ome excu&s;e for going out, and came him&s;elf to inform me of their arrival.</P>
<P>Fortunately Eliza was in her mother's chamber; and it was agreed between him and me he &s;hould bring Charles in the morning, as if to vi&s;it a friend of his; and I was to prepare the ladies for the interview.</P>
<P>When he left me, which was not till I po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on his going, I went to Mrs. Fitzgerald's room to commu|nicate the matter to them, having fir&s;t bid Kitty withdraw; but I was &s;oon obliged to recal her; for I had but ju&s;t &s;aid Mr. Maun&s;ell was with me, when Eliza dropt on the floor in a fainting fit, which put us all into a hurry and confu&s;ion for &s;ome minutes, when &s;he began to revive, and &s;oon after, by proper applications, was perfectly re|covered.</P>
<PB N="166" REF="164">
<P>Her &s;pirits, which were always weak, have been &s;till weaker this while pa&s;t, and &s;unk under the &s;udden mention of Harry's arrival, knowing who accom|panied him.</P>
<P>When we were once more left to our&s;elves, I told her, if &s;he had not re&s;olution to &s;upport the idea of &s;eeing Mr. Skeffington, I feared &s;he would never &s;tand a meeting next morning, &s;o I had better write a note to forbid his coming, as &s;uch another fit might have a bad effect on her health.</P>
<P>She begged I would not teaze her, but tell her was he really to come, &s;ince &s;he found &s;ome preparation would be nece&s;&s;ary to enable her to receive him with any degree of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>I then informed her how we had &s;et|tled it, and advi&s;ed her to retire to re&s;t,
<PB N="167" REF="165">and try to conquer the flutter &s;he had thrown her&s;elf into, el&s;e Charles mu&s;t have a phy&s;ician for his gentleman-u&s;her; as I &s;uppo&s;ed his palpitations would be as great as her's, &s;ome of the faculty &s;hould certainly be at hand to apply proper re|&s;toratives.</P>
<P>I was obliged to talk non&s;en&s;e, to prevent her making &s;uch a &s;erious mat|ter of it, and when I had &s;et her and her mother laughing, at the ridiculous de&s;cription of what I &s;uppo&s;e their meet|ing would be, I bid them good night, and went to my bed, where I &s;lept very comfortably, till di&s;turbed by Eliza, who, I dare &s;ay, had not clo&s;ed her eyes.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, and was but ju&s;t dre&s;&s;ed, when our French Valet informed me two gentlemen enquired for me.&mdash;I in&s;tantly went to them, and &s;oon as I entered the room, Mr. Skeffigton ap|proached with a rueful countenance,
<PB N="168" REF="166">and with great humility ki&s;&s;ing my hand, &s;aid, will Mi&s;s Mortimer receive a pe|nitent, and deign to intercede with her lovely friend for a man who has &s;o high a &s;en&s;e of his faults, that he is inca|pable of pleading his own cau&s;e!</P>
<P>I told him, &s;miling, his &s;ex were &s;eldom &s;o humble; therefore, as I lov|ed to encourage good di&s;po&s;itions, and had be&s;ide a proper &s;tate of the ca&s;e laid before me by Mr. Maun&s;ell, I had ventured to become his advocate, and had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that his aunt and cou&s;in had promi&s;ed to receive him as a friend that had been ab&s;ent, without any retro&s;pect to former di&s;agreeable occurrences, which I believed it would be be&s;t not to mention as yet.</P>
<P>He was full of acknowledgments for my kindne&s;s; and I conducted him to his audience.</P>
<PB N="169" REF="167">
<P>His colour went and came as he ap|proached, and his voice faultered &s;o, he could not articulate a word, which Mrs. Fitzgerald ob&s;erving, &s;tept for|ward to meet him, and kindly taking his hand, &s;aid, my dear child, I rejoice to &s;ee you, (indeed &s;he loves him as if he was he own) then turning to Eliza, will not you welcome your cou&s;in my love? The dear girl, who was little le&s;s agitated than he, held out her hand, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, and then ventured to &s;alute her; while &s;he was utterly unable to &s;peak, as a tear &s;tood trembling in her eye, which would have overflowed its bounds on the lea&s;t at|tempt at &s;peech: their &s;ilence however was &s;ufficiently eloquent, &s;ince it plain|ly di&s;covered how their hearts &s;tood affected to each other.</P>
<P>I thought it high time to put an end to the pantomine, which was likely to become too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;o hurried them into the breakfa&s;t room where Harry
<PB N="170" REF="168">was; who, advancing to pay his com|pliments, relieved them all from a very aukward &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then became gene|ral, till the gentlemen left us, to pay a vi&s;it at Rou&s;&s;illon; being fir&s;t invited to dinner by Mrs. Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>Harry told me after, he had inform|ed Mr. Skeffington, when he got him near our hotel, who he was to meet, and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty he could prevail on him to proceed; not till he a&s;&s;ured him, I would intere&s;t my&s;elf in his favor, and knowing my influence over Eliza he had no doubt of my &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>They continued on the&s;e terms for two days, not a hint of pa&s;t tran&s;ac|tions dropping from either party; when being all engaged to pa&s;s the day at the Chateau, every one, as is u&s;ual there,
<PB N="171" REF="169">di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves as they found mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>Eliza, it &s;eems, had retired to that arbour, where the Compte fir&s;t declar|ed his pa&s;&s;ion to Gertrude, and was followed by Charles, who had ob&s;erved where &s;he went.</P>
<P>I al&s;o was &s;traying in the garden, and pa&s;&s;ing in &s;ight of the place; &s;he came out and joined me, not thinking I &s;aw him there: but if I had not, the blu&s;h &s;till mantling on her cheek would have betrayed her: I ju&s;t patted it &s;ay|ing, well Eliza, that blu&s;h is not for nothing; Charles has pleaded his cau&s;e more effectually than the able&s;t ad|vocate could do; is it not &s;o, &s;he &s;aid, I was a provoking girl, and &s;he would not tell me; &s;he knew I would blame her, and &s;he could not help it now.</P>
<PB N="172" REF="170">
<P>Indeed, Eliza, you wrong me; I ne|ver blame any one for con&s;ulting their own happine&s;s; and I &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, you are the be&s;t judge of what will con|&s;titute your's.</P>
<P>Fie Loui&s;a, &s;aid &s;he; there is no &s;tanding your looks, no more than your expre&s;&s;ions, when you chu&s;e to be teiz|ing.&mdash;Ju&s;t then, to her great relief, we were joined by Madame de St. Veriolle, which prevented our pur&s;uing the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure &s;he was heartily glad of the interruption, for I dare &s;ay, &s;he could not have brought her&s;elf to tell me, &s;he had con&s;ented to give her hand to Charles as &s;oon after our return to Ireland, as matters could be &s;ettled for the purpo&s;e; which I was informed of by Henry, the fir&s;t opportunity he had of &s;peaking to me alone.</P>
<PB N="173" REF="171">
<P>He was full of joy at his friend's &s;ucce&s;s; and a&s;ked if Eliza had told me; no, I replied; but I knew &s;ome|thing of the kind had been the con&s;e|quence, when I &s;aw &s;he had been with him in the arbour, for arbours are of all other places the mo&s;t dangerous to female re&s;olution; he laughed at the idea; and cla&s;ping me to his bo&s;om, wi&s;hed, if that was the ca&s;e, he could find me in one.&mdash;When we get home, you will be all marrying and giving in marriage; I only &s;hall remain in the &s;ingular ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I don't however find my&s;elf a bit unea&s;y at the reflection: the epithet of old maid, is not at all formidable to me; for as I at pre&s;ent meet as much re&s;pect as mo&s;t of the matrons I know, I &s;uppo&s;e that will not be le&s;&s;ened, when encrea&s;e of years makes me wi&s;er and better than I am now.&mdash;I tell you, Emily, I &s;hall retain my good humour,
<PB N="174" REF="172">when you and Eliza are fretting over your &s;qualling Infants.</P>
<P>Charles means to &s;et off in a few days, as he had a good deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do, preparatory to making &s;ettle|ments, and &s;o forth; and wi&s;hes to be in Dublin before November.</P>
<P>We &s;hall remain here till the latter end of October, and Mr. Maun&s;ell &s;tays to be Eliza's Ceci&s;bo: as for me, I have about a dozen lively Frenchmen at command, among&s;t whom I di&s;pen&s;e my &s;miles &s;o equally, that one cannot be jealous of another, and I reign &s;ole Empre&s;s of them all.</P>
<P>Eliza's ideas are &s;o totally engro&s;&s;ed by one object that &s;he can find no amu&s;ement in the agreeable gallantry &s;he would receive here, without their having the lea&s;t de&s;ign on her heart; but &s;he would not take it on her con|&s;cience
<PB N="175" REF="173">to encourage it, fearing lea&s;t any of them &s;hould think her &s;erious, and be hurt when he found &s;he was engaged.</P>
<P>I cannot per&s;wade her that tho&s;e things are mere matters of cour&s;e here, and meant only as politene&s;s; it is im|po&s;&s;ible to argue her out of romantic notions.</P>
<P>Harry takes up his abode at Rou&s;|&s;illon as &s;oon as Charles goes, accord|ing to invitation, the old Compte and Compte&s;&s;e return &s;oon to Paris, and their &s;on-in-law accompanies them: their daughter &s;tays till Gertrude and her lord goes, which will be immedi|ately after we leave this; as &s;he would &s;hortly be unfit for travelling.</P>
<P>You need not expect to hear from me again; for I do not intend writing any more while I am here: and I hope
<PB N="176" REF="174">to find you, and mo&s;t of my friends, in Dublin, by the time I get there.</P>
<P>You are very idle, or rather you have more agreeable amu&s;ement <HI>pour pa&s;&s;er le tempts,</HI> their writing to me; I have had but one letter from you yet: Had I thought of that &s;ooner, I would not have &s;aid a word about Charles and Eliza, and that would mortify you.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will &s;ay, it would be no lo&s;s &s;ince I have &s;o bad a hand at de&s;|cribing love &s;cenes; true, but I have given you the outlines, and as I dare &s;ay you are now pretty conver&s;ant in them, you may &s;upply the deficiency by the power of your own imagination. &mdash;And &s;o, in the true royal &s;tile, we bid you</P>

<P><LABEL>P.

<HEAD>LETTER LII. MISS MORTIMER TO THE COMPTESSE DE ROUSILLON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE>Dec. 12. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we are, my dear Gertrude, after four months ramble, enjoy|ing our&s;elves under our own vines, and under our own fig-trees: No, that will never do in a city.&mdash;But what is far more comfortable at this &s;ea&s;on, and in our climate, we are &s;nug at our
<PB N="179" REF="177">fire-&s;ides, talking over the plea&s;ing hours we &s;pent with our kind friends at Rou&s;&s;illon.</P>
<P>As I wrote to you on our arrival at Harwick; I have taken a little time to re&s;t &s;ince I came home, before I would take up the pen again; for I a&s;&s;ure you, our journey from London was very fatiguing and di&s;agreeable; the wea|ther being extremely &s;evere; at lea&s;t we found it &s;o, we had been &s;o long u&s;ed to the mild air of Montpellier, where none but gentle breezes fan the ro&s;y bowers,</P>
<P>While we were in London, James brought us the account of Mi&s;s Free|man's death&mdash;&s;he had langui&s;hed in a wretched &s;tate, from the time &s;he heard that Charles was gone abroad, mo&s;tly delirious, in which way &s;he died, a martyr to her own ungovernable pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<PB N="180" REF="178">
<P>There is &s;omething&punc; &s;hocking in a woman's &s;o far departing from the de|licacy of her &s;ex, and all the rules of decorum, as this unhappy girl did, I think her friends may rejoice that &s;he is no more; for had &s;he lived, with &s;o little regard to religion, or rectitude, as appeared in her conduct, it is more than probable, &s;he would have brought a reproach on her&s;elf and them.</P>
<P>I found Mr. and Mrs. Herbert in town, and all their little ones; they have five lovely children; and the be&s;t behaved babies I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Their mother, without any har&s;hne&s;s, has let them &s;ee they mu&s;t obey her, therefore it is a point they never di&s;|pute, and a grave look from her, is more effectual, than correction from one who only indulges or chides her children rather according to her own caprice than their de&s;erts.</P>
<PB N="181" REF="179">
<P>Mr. Herbert is very partial to his elde&s;t girl, though Patty frequently re|mon&s;trates again&s;t it as unju&s;t; and in her own behaviour, takes care to &s;hew equal affection to them all, when they equally de&s;erve it, which prevents their little hearts from being filled with jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s how happy it makes me, to have Patty once more in the fame &s;treet with me, as &s;he now is we call to remembrance a thou&s;and plea|&s;ing circum&s;tances that occurred in our childi&s;h days, and enjoy over again our early friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Harry, who tenderly loves his &s;i&s;ter, and has, as you know, &s;ome &s;mall re|gard for your humble &s;ervant, is quite delighted to get us together, and joins in recollecting pa&s;t plea&s;ures: but then he is too apt to dwell on tho&s;e inci|dents
<PB N="182" REF="180">that made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on his heart; however, his tranquillity &s;eems re&s;tored, which adds much to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It is quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to &s;ee our friends repining at di&s;appointments that cannot be remedied; and refu&s;ing the happi|ne&s;s within their reach, becau&s;e &s;ome one thing they wi&s;h for is with-held; perhaps if it was granted, the acqui&s;i|tion might make them mi&s;erable, a thing we have frequent examples of: yet we are not to be convinced that Pro|vidence is wi&s;er than we are.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rochfort is come to town with her father and mother; her marriage is fixed for the 16th; Eliza's the day after.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted on Emily taking the lead, as &s;he was determined to be bride|maid; I would not &s;ay any thing again&s;t
<PB N="183" REF="181">it, becau&s;e I was glad to &s;ee her in &s;uch good &s;pirits; but I have a notion &s;he will repent placing her&s;elf in &s;uch a con|&s;picuous light, the day before her own wedding. She mu&s;t probably &s;tand many jokes on the occa&s;ion, but that to be &s;ure has never occurred to her.</P>
<P>She looks, and is as well as ever I &s;aw her; the cau&s;e of her illne&s;s, which was unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, being remov|ed, the effect has cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Skeffington has given James Grady fifty guineas as a reward for the part he took in bringing tho&s;e let|ters to light; and I find this en|crea&s;e of fortune has encouraged him to offer his hand to my Jenny; (his heart has long been her's) and Jenny has conde&s;cended to accept it, with my approbation.&mdash;You may be &s;ure I &s;hall make &s;ome addition to her portion; and I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he has &s;aved a good deal in my &s;ervice.</P>
<PB N="184" REF="182">
<P>They mean to go into bu&s;ine&s;s, linen and haberda&s;hery they have fixed on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly countenance them; for I think it but right to promote the in|tere&s;t of &s;ervants who have been hone&s;t and faithful; though I totally di&s;ap|prove of making them confidants, or allowing them any influence over us: their education renders them unfit for advi&s;ers, and we often &s;ee the bad ef|fects of young ladies placing confidence in their waiting-maids, who always en|courage them in whatever they know to be their inclination, as they are &s;ure of being rewarded for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance they lend; or even where they mean well, ignorance often leads them into errors; they do not fore&s;ee the bad con&s;equences that may attend their re|peating what they hear, as was the ca&s;e with Eliza's Kitty; for I am &s;ure the girl loves her mi&s;tre&s;s; yet Charles in|cautiou&s;ly betraying his temper to her,
<PB N="185" REF="183">was near proving fatal to the peace of the whole family.</P>
<P>Eliza has talked to her a great deal on the &s;ubject, and intimated an inten|tion of parting with her, le&s;t her in|di&s;cretion might hereafter create di&s;tur|bance; for as &s;he expo&s;ed the only de|fect &s;he had di&s;covered in Mr. Skeffing|ton's di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;tranger, &s;he was no longer to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>Poor Kitty came in great woe, to reque&s;t my intere&s;t with her mi&s;tre&s;s not to di&s;charge her, promi&s;ing never to commit &s;uch a fault again; and &s;he is accordingly rein&s;tated in Eliza's fa|vour.</P>
<P>You &s;hall hear from me when the weddings are over. I am anxiou&s;ly ex|pecting an account of your being &s;afe and well; <HI>faite me bai&s;emens a Mon&s;ieur La. Compte:</HI> and pray pre&s;ent my be&s;t
<PB N="186" REF="184">re&s;pects to all his agreeable family, par|ticularly his amiable &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>&mdash; Dec. 18. &mdash;</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>At length, my dear Gertrude, Eli|za's novel is concluded, like mo&s;t other novels, with the &s;erious cata&s;trophe, matrimony.</P>
<P>The ceremony was performed ye&s;ter|day evening, in what we call a private
<PB N="188" REF="186">manner; that is, quite in the family way; but in &s;uch a family as theirs, you know what a croud they make when gathered together on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>Eliza did not behave quite as well as your lady&s;hip in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances; for it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty &s;he could &s;ay, "I will" loud enough to be heard by the Clergyman, and as to the re&s;t, we could only per|ceive her lips moved to the words; the good man, however, who &s;aw her heart was con&s;enting, took the will for the deed, el&s;e I think &s;he would &s;till have remained a maiden; indeed he e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his &s;ex &s;o far, as to in&s;i&s;t on her pronouncing the word obey, pretty audibly: now had I been in her place, that of all words never &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed my lips; I whi&s;per|ed that to Harry fir&s;t opportunity; he replied, &s;miling, he would venture to take me even on them terms, if I would &s;ay I loved: No, &s;aid I, for if you
<PB N="189" REF="187">would di&s;pen&s;e with my promi&s;ing obe|dience, I &s;hould fear you meant to en|force the doctrine by &s;ome more power|ful argument: he called me &s;ome fond name, &s;aying, he mu&s;t be a brute in|deed that would de&s;ire me to comply with any thing that was di&s;agreeable to me.</P>
<P>How mild and gentle tho&s;e men talk before marriage, and how &s;oon they change their tone after; yet you can produce one that continues the &s;ame &s;tile, and I have &s;ome little idea that Harry would have been like him.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h he could conquer an attach|ment that promi&s;es &s;o little &s;atisfaction; for I want to make up a match between him and Harriet Boyle, who&s;e heart &s;eems perfectly di&s;engaged, and &s;he has wholly laid a&s;ide her affectation&mdash;but it is in vain to think of it, for he is quite determined.</P>
<PB N="190" REF="188">
<P>How I wander from my &s;ubject: to return to it then&mdash;Charles's behaviour was tender and attentive, but delicate|ly &s;o, endeavouring all he could to keep up her &s;pirits, in which Harry and I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; for the re&s;t of the young folks were more inclined to amu&s;e them&s;elves at her expence.</P>
<P>Cards however relieved her from their raillery, be&s;ide &s;ome &s;hare of it was directed to Emily and her bride-groom, who, as I told you, were mar|ried the night before, and a good many of the &s;ame company had been at their wedding.</P>
<P>She too was much affected; though &s;he had gone through all the ceremony before; but her heart was now con|cerned, and &s;he was agitated by all the hopes and fears, &s;o natural to tho&s;e who love.</P>
<PB N="191" REF="189">
<P>Doubtle&s;s the unhappine&s;s &s;he had already experienced in the &s;tate, mu&s;t have cau&s;ed &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions, when &s;he reflected on the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of being again &s;ubject to the &s;ame, though there is all the rea&s;on in the world to believe &s;he has nothing of that kind to fear from her pre&s;ent choice, as there does not appear to be the lea&s;t defect in his temper, and &s;he, you know, is all &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>They are to accompany Charles and his bride to Ca&s;tle Skeffington; as will all the bride men and maids; of which number are Mr. Maun&s;ell, and your Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>We &s;pend the chri&s;tmas there; then pay a vi&s;it, by invitation, to Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, and return from thence to Dublin.</P>
<PB N="192" REF="190">
<P>I forgot to tell you Mr. Fitzgerald looked a little cool on Charles when fir&s;t they met, after our return from France, and not very cordial on Eliza; he was di&s;plea&s;ed with him for his be|haviour, and with her for not re&s;enting it; till I laid the true &s;tate of the affair before him, which reconciled him to them both, el&s;e it might have had un|plea&s;ing con&s;equences, as he would have certainly told Mr. Skeffington his mind, who would probably have been too high &s;pirited to enter into any ex|planation of the matter.</P>
<P>The prevalence of that mo&s;t horrid cu&s;tom, duelling, makes one tremble at the pro&s;pect of warm words between men.</P>
<P>Eliza, who ob&s;erved her cou&s;in's cool|ne&s;s, was very apprehen&s;ive, till I un|dertook to remove it: I was happpy in
<PB N="193" REF="191">&s;ucceeding; and they are now ju&s;t as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave town, the 20th, do not expect another epi&s;tle till I come back; for I know we &s;hall live in a perpetual hurry of company while we remain in the country; as all the peo|ple will croud to pay their compliments to the two new married couple.</P>
<P>Mrs. Fitzgerald is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the happie&s;t creature now in the kingdom, in &s;eeing her two darlings united, after the great danger there was of their be|ing &s;eparated for ever.</P>
<P>She has forgot all her complaints, and is as young as any of us: I hope &s;he will long continue to enjoy her pre|&s;ent &s;atisfaction, which nothing can add to, except living to &s;ee half a dozen grand-children playing about her.</P>
<PB N="194" REF="192">
<P>I expect my next will be a congratu|lation on the birth of a little Mon&s;ieur or Madamoi&s;elle; be it which it will I be&s;eech you, Gertrude, do not dre&s;s it in the French &s;tile till it's childi&s;h years are &s;omewhat pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I think the children in France, &s;o be powdered, and curled, have ju&s;t the appearance of a race of dwarfs; do let yours look like infants while they are &s;o; for you cannot make them like any thing half &s;o plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The time employed in writing this, I have &s;tolen from the hours of re&s;t; finding it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain a mo|ment for the purpo&s;e during the day, I am &s;o entirely engaged with the wed|ding folks, who will not excu&s;e my ab|&s;ence.</P>
<PB N="195" REF="193">
<P>They all de&s;ire me to a&s;&s;ure you and the Compte of their kinde&s;t regards.</P>
