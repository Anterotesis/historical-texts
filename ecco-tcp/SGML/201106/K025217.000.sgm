<P>ABOUT Five Years ago he felt a Sorene&s;s in his Left Side, after having rode Four Days together, and made Water, which was fir&s;t coffee-colour'd, and then bloody. The&s;e Complaints went off in a &s;hort time; however, he became, after this, &s;ubject to make bloody Water upon Riding: He felt once a mo&s;t violent Pain along the
<PB N="2" REF="3">Region of the Right Ureter; it la&s;ted only for a Moment, and happened during a Fit of Cholic, occa&s;ioned by eating Strawberries. About Two Years ago he was obliged to for|bear riding, and could hardly walk without making bloody Water; had Pain in making Water, and a Forcing to go to Stool at the &s;ame time, but no Stoppage: He began Mrs. <HI>Ste|phens</HI>'s Medicines in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t; they increa&s;ed the Pain in making Water for &s;ome time; his Water became turbid at the time of making, had ropy fetid Matter in it, depo&s;ited a thick heavy Sediment, and many &s;mall Flakes and Fragments of Stones were voided with it in a &s;oft State: In Five or Six Weeks he grew much better, and was able to go over the Stones in his Coach: His general Health was al&s;o much improved. In the Beginning of <HI>July</HI> he had a Return of the Pain in making Water, with a &s;udden Stoppage now and then: Upon this he voided &s;everal Pieces of Stone in a &s;oft State, with one pretty large Piece, Part of which was &s;oft and white, Part brown and hard, and it gave a little Pain in pa&s;&s;ing: After this the Pain and Stoppage in making Water went off intirely. In <HI>September</HI> he went into the Coun|try, where he often rides a trotting Hor&s;e with|out any Inconvenience; and is free from all Complaints, excepting that he has now and then &s;ome unea&s;y Sen&s;ations in the Region of the Kidneys: He has continued the Medicines till a little while ago; but his Water has been in general perfectly clear, during the U&s;e of
<PB N="3" REF="4">them; whereas it has twice been turbid upon di&s;continuing them, and depo&s;its a red Sedi|ment, which dries into a &s;tony Sub&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>II. <HI>The Ca&s;e of Mr.</HI> Binford, <HI>at Mr.</HI> Cameray<HI>'s, in</HI> Tokenhou&s;e-yard, Throgmorton-&s;treet.</HEAD>
<P>HE had a Stone taken out of his Bladder by the Operation, when about Ten Years old; has had the Symptoms of a Stone in the Blad|der now again, for about Six Years. A Sur|geon at <HI>Exeter</HI> examined him twice by the Finger in the Anus, and found both times in the mo&s;t evident manner a Stone in the Blad|der, which he imagined to be as big as an Egg. Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> perceived the Motions of this Stone during the Examinations, and made bloody Water after one of them. He began Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines about the middle of la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in a &s;hort time after voided many white Scales, and much brown Grit in a &s;oft and rotten State: Since this he has voided many irregular Shells of Stone, of a con&s;iderable Size, and of &s;uch a Thickne&s;s, as to con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal Coats, from Two to Six in Number:
<PB N="4" REF="5">Many of the&s;e, when voided, are covered with a Whitene&s;s, which being rubb'd off, the Shell appears to be brown. On the 30th of <HI>January</HI> he had a Suppre&s;&s;ion of Urine; Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Catheter then, and found a Stone in the Bladder, which he told Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> he believed to be very &s;mall, tho' he would not pre&s;ume to be certain. Mr. <HI>Binford</HI> has voided many more Pieces of Stone &s;ince this, and Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI> is in daily Expectation of his being perfectly well.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TOWARDS the latter Part of my Life, when in my Fiftieth Year, about 1720, I was &s;ore pained with the Stone, until I voided a large one; at &s;everal times &s;ince about a Dozen; Part came away after a little riding, and then I made Water like Coffee: But I imagine, one of the large&s;t might &s;tay behind; for in 1735 I began to be greatly afflicted; could not endure to ride, or bear a Coach: When I have been making Water, it often
<PB N="5" REF="6">&s;topped on a &s;udden, cau&s;ing much Pain; and no Per&s;on in the Country could give Relief, tho' I took a many odd Things. Reading the Papers, I ob&s;erved, &s;ome Specificks for the Stone were advertized, one a Powder, the other a Liquid: I got 'em, and try'd each; but was not able to go thro' with either of 'em; being of a forcing Nature, increa&s;ed my Pain: Then was advi&s;ed to &s;mooth palliating Medi|cines, yet Pain &s;till continued, and exce&s;&s;ive; made me begin to think of coming up to <HI>Lon|don</HI> to be cut, if it might be &s;afely done at my Age: At that time the News informed us, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells</HI> and others were cured by taking Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medi|cines: I was then more inclinable to come: When I &s;et out, my Thoughts were to un|dergo the manual Operation, and had wrote to Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden</HI> about it: When I arrived in <HI>London,</HI> and con&s;ulted with &s;ome Friends, it was thought, as I was in my 68th Year, the &s;afe&s;t way to take Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines; and accordingly on the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> 1737, I began with 'em, taking Three Powders, and Three half Pints of Liquid every Day: What Effect, and how they did operate, you will &s;ee by the following Diary, which I kept as exactly as I could, con&s;idering the Pain I had by times; which yet prompted me to keep &s;trictly to the Medicines, believing, that by &s;o doing, I &s;hould the &s;ooner be made ea&s;y, and took the Liquid Four times a Day for &s;ome Weeks.</P>

<P>HAVING been very much afflicted with the Stone and Gravel, and having by the be&s;t means I could, endeavour'd to get Relief, at length, in the utmo&s;t of my Extremity, I was recommended to Mrs. <HI>Stephens;</HI> and &s;oon

This continued for &s;ome time, and in about Two or Three Months I found my|&s;elf freed from a Pain, I had felt at times for &s;everal Years, on the Right Side of the Bladder. And I am well a&s;&s;ured, it was a Stone or cal|culous Matter, which &s;tuck to the Bladder. Be&s;ides this, I had a loo&s;e Stone in the Bladder, which for &s;everal Months after gave me ex|treme Pain, by its forcing when I made Wa|ter; which at length came away in Pieces, almo&s;t every time I made Water, for about Nine Weeks following; until at la&s;t it came all away, as appeared by my being freed from all manner of Pain. The Kernel of the Stone it&s;elf having come away, I thought my&s;elf then intirely well, tho' afterwards, upon a Journey to <HI>London,</HI> &s;ome Stones fell from my Kidneys, which came away to the Number of Seven at one time, which made me pre&s;ume too far in di&s;continuing the Medicines in great Part, having little or no Pain; when a Stone, which had &s;tuck in the Ureters, came down, and &s;topped the Pa&s;&s;age of the Urine, which occa&s;ioned a Suppre&s;&s;ion of it, and out of Fear of its not pa&s;&s;ing, I had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Che&s;elden;</HI> and, I thank God, I am now free of any Pain, and have been &s;o ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>HE had the u&s;ual Symptoms of a Stone in the Bladder, and began Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, being about 75 Years old. <HI>October</HI> the Eighth Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> examined him, and found a Stone in the Blad|der, which he told Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> he believed to be a large one: Upon fir&s;t taking the Me|dicines Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Water depo&s;ited much heavy Sediment, which dried into a &s;tony Sub&s;tance: Some time after he voided &s;oft white Scales in great Quantities with Grit and Slime, which I &s;aw.

This Stone Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hawkins</HI> &s;aw <HI>Jan.</HI> 30. I &s;aw Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> that Evening, and took down from his Mouth the
<PB N="26" REF="27">following Words, relating to the Appearance of the Stone.</P>
<Q>The Stone was light, white on the Out&s;ide, a great Part of it covered with a cretaceous Coat, which broke off in Flakes with great Ea&s;e, perfectly like to tho&s;e before voided, as appeared by comparing them. The Stone would to any indifferent Per&s;on plainly ap|pear as if acted upon by a Solvent, &s;o as to have greatly dimini&s;hed its Bulk. The inner Part of the Stone was reddi&s;h, and harder than the external, when tried by a Knife. There were Two Bulgings, which ro&s;e pretty high above the Stone, and which appeared to be le&s;s acted upon by the Solvent than the other Parts. The Stone was not covered equably with the &s;ame Coat, but what co|vered one Part appeared to have been taken off in others.</Q>
<P>The next Day I &s;aw Mr. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> and took down from his Mouth the following Words relating to the Appearance of the Stone:
<Q>He &s;aw a Stone weighing nearly Two Ounces, as Mrs. <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;aid. The Surface was of a whiti&s;h Colour, and in Part covered with a Matter that had all the Appearance of the &s;oft Shells that had before come away in Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Water. This Matter was very &s;oft, and ready to fall off and crumble upon the lea&s;t Touch. By the&s;e Appearances he &s;ays, that he &s;hould imagine that the Stone had been larger, and that this &s;oft Matter &s;eem'd to he ready to fall off in a little time. The
<PB N="27" REF="28">Part of the Stone not covered with this &s;caly Matter, appeared, when &s;craped with a Knife, of a ru&s;ty Iron Colour, and con&s;iderably hard.</Q></P>
<P><HI>ANY Per&s;on who is di&s;po&s;ed to inquire more particularly into the Effects of the&s;e Medi|cines, may have a Li&s;t of tho&s;e that take them, at Mr.</HI> Winter<HI>'s, in</HI> Richbell-Court, Red-Lyon-&s;treet, <HI>from whence they are given out: However, I hope, the&s;e Ten Ca&s;es will be &s;uffi|cient to engage the Attention of all Well-Wi&s;hers to Mankind; and I have been determined in my Choice of them, rather by the Eminence of the Per&s;ons, by their living in Town, or by the &s;trong Pre&s;umption of at lea&s;t a partial Di&s;&s;o|lution of a Stone, than by the Greatne&s;s of the Benefit received.

<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS, Tending to ILLUSTRATE the Foregoing Ca&s;es.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. SINCE I have taken Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medicines, my Urine has been of a more urinous Smell than u&s;ual; tur|bid at the time of making, and <HI>alkaline,</HI> that is, it turns Syrup of Violets green, and fer|ments with the following acid Liquors, Oil of Vitriol, Spirit of Vitriol, Oil of Sulphur, Spi|rit of Nitre, Spirit of Sea-Salt, Vinegar, and Lemon-Juice. And as far as I can judge, the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with all who take the&s;e Medi|cines. This I thought very remarkable when I fir&s;t ob&s;erved it, and began to hope, that Urine, which was &s;o different from common Urine, might have different Effects upon Stones in the Kidneys and Bladder. And I have lately been informed, that even common Urine, when it putrifies, that is, turns alka|line
<PB N="29" REF="30">by being kept, will di&s;&s;olve and take up the calculous Incru&s;tations, upon the Sides and Bottoms of Chamber-pots.</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to &s;atisfy my&s;elf the better in this Affair, I thought it not ami&s;s to try what Effects my Urine, thus render'd alkaline by the Medicines, would have upon Stones taken from a human Body, by dige&s;ting them in it with a gentle Heat. For this Purpo&s;e I took the Stones A and B, and &s;awed each of them into Four Pieces, of nearly the &s;ame Shape and Size. A was a white hard Stone of an uniform Sub&s;tance throughout. It con&s;i&s;ted of Coats indeed, but the&s;e were all, as far as one could judge, perfectly alike. B was a brown Stone; it's Shell was hard and knotted, but the internal Parts were much &s;ofter. I called the &s;everal Pieces A 1, B 1; A 2, B 2; A 3, B 3; A 4, B 4; in order to denote thereby the &s;everal Liquors in which each was dige&s;ted; 1 &s;tanding for New River Wa|ter; 2 for a Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Powder and New River Water; 3 for com|mon Urine; and 4 for my own Alkaline Urine. I then dige&s;ted all the&s;e Pieces of Stone for a Week in their re&s;pective Liquors, with a gentle Heat. This Heat was intended to have been the &s;ame as that of Urine in the Blad|der; but my Contrivances not being good, it was, at different Times, both con&s;iderably greater, and con&s;iderably le&s;s. I examined them pretty often, and recruited the Liquors as they wa&s;ted, with others of the &s;ame Kind.
<PB N="30" REF="31">Two or three Days after they were put into Dige&s;tion, I ob&s;erved that A 4 had &s;ome white Scales lying upon its Surface in &s;everal Parts, which fell off upon being pre&s;s'd with my Nail. After a Week's Dige&s;tion, I took them out, and rubb'd them all with a Cloth. They were then laid in a Window till they became perfectly dry. And the following Table &s;hews the Effects which the &s;everal Liquors had upon them.</P>

<P N="3">III. By this Table it appears, that the Pieces A 4, B 4 in my alkaline Urine, had lo&s;t more than any of the others; A 1, B 1, in New River Water, more than A 2, B 2 in the Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens's</HI> Powder and New River Water; and that A 3, B 3 in common Urine had receiv'd a &s;mall Addition. That my alkaline Urine &s;hould occa&s;ion the greate&s;t Lo&s;s, is a Pre&s;umption in favour of Mrs. <HI>Ste|phens</HI>'s Medicines; that the New River Wa|ter &s;hould have a greater Effect, than the Mixture of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Powder and New
<PB N="31" REF="32">River Water, was owing, I believe, to the Powder's adhering clo&s;ely to the Stones in &s;e|veral Parts; which both kept the Water from coming freely in Contact with the Stones, and al&s;o added to their Weight; and the In|crea&s;e of Weight in A 3, B 3, is an Appear|ance of the &s;ame Kind with the Growth of Stones in the Body. And upon examining A 3 accurately, I perceived that it had got an exceeding thin Coat in &s;everal Parts, which &s;eparated ea&s;ily, and which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Accretion from the &s;tony Particles of the common Urine, in which it had been dige&s;ted.</P>
<P N="4">IV. After this I wa&s;hed the &s;everal Pieces of the Stone A, and rubb'd them well with a Bru&s;h, &s;o as to take off all loo&s;e Parts; I took out the &s;oft internal Parts of the Pieces of B, re&s;erving proper Portions of each of the hard Shells; I &s;awed the Stones C, D, and E into Four Pieces each, of nearly the &s;ame Shape and Size, and F into Two; I took Two Pieces of the white Shell G, Two of the brown Nucleus H, and gave them all Names as in the following Table, in which 1 denotes New River Water, as before; 2 Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Liquid; 3 common Urine, as before; and 4 my own alkaline Urine, as be|fore. The&s;e Pieces were dige&s;ted for a Week, in the Manner above-mentioned, excepting that the Liquors were now changed every Morning, and all the Pieces rubb'd at the &s;ame Time with a wet Sponge. They were rubb'd al&s;o when taken out as clean as could

<PB N="33" REF="34">
<P N="5">V. By this Table it appears, that the Stones had lo&s;t much more in general by this Week's Dige&s;tion, than by the former; which without doubt was owing in great mea&s;ure to my hav|ing rubbed them every Morning with a wet Sponge; and it was al&s;o upon this account, I &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome of the Pieces in common Urine had lo&s;t a little. However, the great Difference of Lo&s;s in the &s;everal Pieces of the &s;ame Stone could not ari&s;e from this Cau&s;e; and the rubbing them gave me an Opportu|nity of ob&s;erving the Manner in which the &s;everal Liquors acted upon the Stones. This was, in general, giving a Whitene&s;s to the Sur|face of the Stones, which, when it was rubbed off, left the Stone of its former Colour; but in tho&s;e which were mo&s;t affected, &s;oft white Scales fell off upon being rubbed, and &s;ome of them were corroded, and honey-combed. Thus the Pieces in New River Water had a White|ne&s;s upon their Surface, and the Water it&s;elf became milky; A 2, A 4, C 2, C 4, F 4, and H 4 had all lo&s;t white Scales; B 2, E 2 and E 4 were all pretty much corroded; D 2 a little corroded; B 4 was corroded within, and at the &s;ame time its knotted external Sur|face rendered &s;mooth; D 4 had its brown Surface turned white, but G 4 &s;eemed not to have been affected at all.</P>
<P N="6">VI. In order to &s;atisfy my&s;elf &s;till farther, I took all the foregoing Stones, H 3 and H 4 excepted, which were lo&s;t by rea&s;on of their Smallne&s;s; and dige&s;ted them again in their
<PB N="34" REF="35">re&s;pective Liquors, having now got a Contri|vance, by which they were kept in a Heat, not differing materially from that of Urine in the Bladder. I got al&s;o Two &s;mall round Stones from the Reverend Dr. <HI>Hales,</HI> which were both taken out of the Bladder of the &s;ame Per&s;on, and which the Doctor judged to be very hard ones, and called them I 3 and I 4. I 3 weighed Twenty-five Grains and an half, and was put into common Urine; I 4 weighed Twenty-one Grains and an half, and was put into my own alkaline Urine. I began the Dige&s;tion <HI>July</HI> 26. The Liquors were changed every Day during the whole Di|ge&s;tion, and the Stones all rubbed with a wet Sponge every Day for the fir&s;t Ten Days; then once in Three or Four Days till <HI>Sept.</HI> 3, but after that not at all. And the following Table &s;hews the Day on which each Stone was either &s;o far wa&s;ted as not to be found, or reduced to &s;uch a Size, as to be in Danger of being confounded with the &s;mall Pieces, which fell from the re&s;t.</P>

<P>I omitted to &s;et down the Day, on which C 4 was judged to be wa&s;ted; but I remember, that it was not till towards the latter End of the Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. All this time the &s;everal Pieces in common Urine continued intire, and even had Incru&s;tations upon them. I took them out <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. and having weighed them <HI>Nov.</HI> 15. when they were perfectly dry, found that they had all receiv'd an Increa&s;e of Weight, as in the following Table:</P>

<P N="8">VIII. The Manner in which the other Pieces wa&s;ted, was in general the &s;ame as that which is de&s;cribed above in the 6th Para|graph, excepting that tho&s;e in New River
<PB N="36" REF="37">Water became after &s;ome time as much honey|combed as the re&s;t, and wa&s;ted as fa&s;t; that D 4 and G 4 remained unaltered to Appear|ance for a long time, and then grew quite rot|ten in a few Days; and that I 4, the &s;mall hard Stone given me by Dr. <HI>Hales,</HI> had &s;everal Cracks in it, after about a Month's Dige&s;tion.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Be&s;ides the&s;e I made &s;everal other Ex|periments, the Re&s;ult of which it may not be improper ju&s;t to mention.</P>
<P N="10">X. I dige&s;ted different Pieces of the &s;ame Stones in my own alkaline Urine, with diffe|rent Heats; the one, that of Urine in the Bladder, the other &s;o great, that I could not bear my Hand at re&s;t in it; and I found, that the le&s;s Heat had the greater Effect.</P>
<P N="11">XI. I boiled different Pieces of the &s;ame Stones in common Water, my own alkaline Urine, and common Urine, for Five Hours each. Tho&s;e in Water and my Urine wa&s;ted con&s;iderably, and the Surface of the la&s;t was turned white and &s;oft; but tho&s;e in common Urine had little Effect produced upon them.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I dige&s;ted different Pieces of the &s;ame Stones in common Water, the di&s;tilled Water of Water-Pepper, the Juice and the Decoc|tion of it; and found that common Water had a greater Effect than any of the&s;e. The Heat in this and all the following Experiments did not differ materially from that of Urine in the Bladder.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. I dige&s;ted Pieces of Stones taken from the human Bladder, from the Bladders of
<PB N="37" REF="38">Dogs, and the Stomachs of Hor&s;es, in <HI>Thames</HI> Water, and in Pump Water, and found, that both the Waters di&s;&s;olved all the human Stones intirely, and wa&s;ted the others very much; but the <HI>Thames</HI> Water had the quicke&s;t Ef|fect. The Waters were changed every Morn|ing, at which time I ob&s;erved, that the Pump Water poured on the Day before, had always &s;ome Bubbles upon it. Some of the human Stones were cracked during the Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I dige&s;ted Pieces of the &s;ame Dogs and Hor&s;es Stones in common Urine, and my own alkaline Urine; but did not ob&s;erve any Effect, except that one of the Dog's Stones &s;eemed a little &s;oftened by my Urine.</P>
<P N="15">XV. I dige&s;ted a large Kidney-&s;tone, Two Pieces that had been boiled in my alkaline Urine, and a round hard Stone in common Urine, which was a Mixture of different Urines. The Kidney-&s;tone and the Two Pieces lo&s;t &s;omething of their Weight. The round hard Stone grew black at fir&s;t, but whe|ther it was wa&s;ted or not, I cannot determine from its Appearance, and I had not weighed it. The Surface of the Kidney-&s;tone was rendered &s;o brittle, that large Scales broke off with very little Force, but they were neither white nor &s;oft.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. I dige&s;ted a large Kidney-&s;tone of the &s;ame Shape, Size and Texture, with the fore|going, and taken out of the other Kidney of the &s;ame Per&s;on, with Twelve different Stones, or Pieces of Stones, in the alkaline Urine of a
<PB N="38" REF="39">Gentleman, who took Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Medi|cines. They all wa&s;ted very fa&s;t, excepting one Piece, which received a &s;mall Addition. It was iron-coloured, and exceedingly hard, as I found by &s;awing it. It appeared to me, that this Gentleman's Urine had in general a quicker Effect than my own. The Stones mentioned in this, the 10th, 13th, 14th and 15th Para|graphs, were none of them rubbed.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. There are &s;ome Appearances men|tioned in this Ab&s;tract, which I cannot ac|count for; but if the Experiments were re|peated with more Accuracy, and other new ones tried, it is probable, that many u&s;eful Di&s;coveries would ari&s;e. And thus much I think one may venture to conclude, even from the&s;e Experiments, that the Di&s;&s;olutions by the &s;everal Sorts of common Water prove again&s;t the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of an acrimo|nious Liquid for this Purpo&s;e, and that tho&s;e by the Two alkaline Urines are &s;trong Pre|&s;umptions in Favour of Mrs. <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Me|dicines, e&s;pecially when compared with the foregoing Ca&s;es. I &s;hall be much obliged to any Gentleman, who will furni&s;h me with Stones, for the farther Pro&s;ecution of this Matter.</P>
