<P>_SOME few Days pa&s;s'd in the common Way, when Mr. <HI>Sang|froid</HI> entered, and with Plea|&s;ure told <HI>Conyers,</HI> he had pro|vided him a good Place.&mdash; <Q>My Lord Bi&s;hop of &mdash;, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> wants ju&s;t &s;uch an one as you to tran&s;cribe his <HI>Works,</HI> and keep &s;ome Accounts.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Conyers,</HI> without He&s;itation, accepted the Offer, and next Morning was
<PB N="4" REF="3">
pre&s;ented to the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and immediately entered on his Office.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> was a great <HI>Writer;</HI> but his Works were intended for the U&s;e of Po&s;terity, having never publi&s;hed but a <HI>Thank&s;giving Sermon,</HI> and one on the 30th of <HI>January</HI> by Order of the Hou&s;e of Lords. His Tracts were very voluminous, but all e&s;&s;ential, and of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to Mankind. His Treati&s;e on the <HI>U&s;e</HI> and <HI>Abu&s;e of Surplices and Lawn Sleeves</HI> was filled with the profounde&s;t Erudition.&mdash; His Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>Pews, Cu&s;hions,</HI> and <HI>Mats,</HI> in Churches, was extremely well handled; but the Po&s;t&s;cript on <HI>the Crime of &s;leeping in tho&s;e Places,</HI> was &s;o artfully worded, that you felt an Example in your&s;elf. &mdash;His Letter to the Inhabitants of the Pari&s;h of &mdash; clearly demon&s;trated the <HI>Ab&s;urdity of a Steeple without Bells.</HI>&mdash;His <HI>Apology</HI> and <HI>Vindication</HI> of <HI>Murder, Adultery,</HI> and <HI>Forni|cation,</HI> proving, mathematically, that the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Name</HI> of the&s;e Crimes were en|tirely changed by <HI>Circum&s;tance, Time,</HI> and <HI>Place,</HI> was a mo&s;t learned and elaborate Performance; but his favourite Work was his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Tithes,</HI> which he demon&s;trated to be an <HI>E&s;&s;ential of True Re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">HIS Lord&s;hip, at different Times, was &s;o good as fully to explain the&s;e Subjects to <HI>Conyers,</HI> who in three Months had tran&s;cribed the Treati&s;e on <HI>Surplices,</HI> and had ju&s;t began the la&s;t-mentioned Work. He had full Employment, but was not extremely plea&s;ed with the Nature of it, for his Ta&s;te was &s;o vitiated, that he found no Charms in what he did not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>THE Bi&s;hop kept a plentiful Table, where his <HI>Clergy</HI> were welcome, except the poorer Sort, to whom he made ample Amends for the Di&s;tinction by &s;mall Pre|&s;ents and large Promi&s;es. He was a Man of Virtue, and religiou&s;ly kept his Word, when his Memory, which was none of the be&s;t, fail'd him not. So weak was he in that Quarter, that he remembered and for|got his Promi&s;e to a poor Curate ten dif|ferent Times, and as often was angry with him&s;elf. On the&s;e Occa&s;ions he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>Well, God help me! I find I am grown old; my Faculties can't la&s;t for ever;&mdash; <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord ta|keth away.</HI></Q>&mdash;Sometimes indeed his Me|mory was very &s;harp, for if one, or ten of his Clergy, were &s;ick, he never failed a daily Enquiry after their Health; and when any died, he never &s;uffered the Li|ving to lap&s;e. He could not bear Contra|diction,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and no Doubt his Dependants were careful not to offend in that Article.&mdash;He did not <HI>like Money,</HI> but he pa&s;&s;ionately <HI>lov'd it.</HI></P>
<P>JACK did not much approve of his Si|tuation. He lived well, but he plainly &s;aw he had no great Pro&s;pect of a future Fortune, and looked on him&s;elf as <HI>Gil Blas</HI> when with the Archbi&s;hop, which deter|mined him to be &s;oon convinced of what he had to depend on. He had Thoughts of writing a mode&s;t and moving Letter to his Lord&s;hip; but then he remembered, That '<HI>a Ver&s;e may catch him, who a Sermon flies;</HI> &s;o re&s;olved to write a Stanza or two, and leave it on my Lord's De&s;k next Morning. Accordingly he &s;at down and wrote,
<Q><LG>
<L>Tho' ev'ry <HI>Virtue</HI> fills my Heart,</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> o'er-&s;preads my Face,</L>
<L>What are their <HI>Worth,</HI> except &s;ome <HI>Art</HI></L>
<L>Can rai&s;e the&s;e Virtues into <HI>Place.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet tho' I can't my&s;elf <HI>commend,</HI></L>
<L>Kind <HI>Fate</HI> may &s;till relieve my Want,</L>
<L>And, as <HI>dull Sermons</HI> always end,</L>
<L>Heaven of it's gracious Mercy grant!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">MY LORD mounted to his Study as u&s;ual, and found the Scrowl, which he carefully read, and as carefully put into his Pocket.&mdash;Family Prayers and Breakfa&s;t being ended, <HI>Jack</HI> was ordered to attend him.&mdash; <Q>Good-morrow, Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, I am extremely concerned that my Under&s;tanding did not di&s;cover your Worth and Genius before this Morn|ing. They are &s;o uncommon, they ought to be rewarded.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> applauded him&s;elf for his lucky Thought, but my Lord proceeded &mdash; <Q>I have a Paper in my Hand, on which you will permit my making a few Remarks. I believe it is intended for Poetry, which at the be&s;t, is an idle unprofitable Study; I &s;hall not &s;peak of the Rhime, but of the Subject. &mdash; Your fir&s;t Line is fal&s;e, for as you want <HI>Prudence,</HI> you cannot have <HI>every Virtue.</HI>&mdash;Your &s;econd is not Fact, for I never &s;aw you <HI>blu&s;h</HI> in my Life.&mdash;Oh&mdash; I a&s;k your Pardon, you blu&s;h now in|deed.&mdash;As to the <HI>Worth</HI> of your <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> I am afraid you will find it of little or no Value, and your <HI>Art</HI> mu&s;t be extraordinary, if you think to impo&s;e on <HI>me.</HI> &mdash; But it &s;eems you want a <HI>Place.</HI> &mdash; I &s;hall &s;oon put you into the High-road to Preferment.&mdash;Your Second Stanza

is mo&s;t admirable. &mdash; You can't <HI>Prai&s;e your&s;elf,</HI> poor Gentleman! although you tell us of your <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;ty.</HI>&mdash; This indeed is the Height of Mode&s;ty! Then, like a true Heathen, you believe in <HI>Fate.</HI> &mdash; If &s;o, pray Mr. <HI>John</HI> take care of your Fate.&mdash;Here you complain bitterly of <HI>Want.</HI> Can any Man be &s;aid to want, who has three good Meals a Day?&mdash; Now comes the be&s;t of all.&mdash; You are one of tho&s;e fine Gentlemen who can't play the Fool but they mu&s;t bring in the <HI>Church.</HI> You abu&s;e <HI>Sermons.</HI>&mdash; Who make Sermons but the Clergy?&mdash; and the <HI>Clergy</HI> make the <HI>Church.</HI> The&s;e Matters, Mr. <HI>John,</HI> ought to be held in Reverence by all Men, much more by &s;uch as you.'&mdash; 'I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> to &mdash;' 'Pray Sir, &s;pare me, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> for I have but a few Words more to &s;ay.&mdash;You were &s;o good as to give me a Bit of <HI>Poetry,</HI> and, in Return, permit me to give you a Bit of <HI>Pro&s;e.</HI></Q>&mdash;He then rung his Bell, and giving him a Paper pro|ceeded.&mdash;<Q>Here is, Mr. <HI>John Conyers,</HI> &s;ome of my own Compo&s;ition, and to &s;hew you it is of &s;ome Value, pray tack the&s;e ten Guineas to it.&mdash;So now, Mr. <HI>John Conyers,</HI> you are a Free-Man, and have
<PB N="9" REF="8">
my Con&s;ent to get what <HI>Place</HI> you plea&s;e.</Q> &mdash;My Lord's Gentleman then entered the Chamber.&mdash;<Q><HI>Lewis, &s;aid my Lord,</HI> here is Mr. <HI>John,</HI> who has given me &s;uch a Lecture on his <HI>Modesty,</HI> that convinces me is the mo&s;t impudent Fellow breath|ing: So, bid the Porter open the Door and let him out. Such Mode&s;ty ought to be &s;een in the World.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> was ex|tremely mortified, and attempted to &s;peak, but <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;houlder'd him out of the Room. Finding he could have no Remedy, he bundled up his little Effects, quitted the Hou&s;e, and &s;oon vi&s;ited Mr. <HI>Sangfroid,</HI> to whom he told his Story.</P>
<P><Q>THIS Accident, <HI>&s;aid his Friend,</HI> gives me little Concern, for I believe his Lord|&s;hip would never have provided for you as you de&s;erve; but, if you will wear a Livery, I can get you into <HI>Sir Peter Shallow</HI>'s Service To-morrow. He is a Member of Parliament, and perhaps, in Time, may procure you an Employ|ment.'&mdash;'It is worth the Trial, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> and a Livery &s;hall be no Ob|jection.</Q>&mdash;Next Day <HI>Jack</HI> attended <HI>Sir Peter,</HI> and received the Badge of Office; but, by the Advice of his Friend, he took the Name of <HI>Con&s;tant.</HI></P>

<P>SIR PETER SHALLOW was a Gentleman of large Fortune, but more remarkable for his ea&s;y, quiet Temper, than &s;trong Judgment. His Lady had &s;omewhat of the oppo&s;ite Character, and, as her <HI>Under|&s;tanding</HI> informed her <HI>Sir Peter</HI> had but a &s;mall Share, &s;he took the accu&s;tomed Pri|viledge of, &s;ometimes, impo&s;ing on it, and indeed his great Fondne&s;s gave her frequent Opportunities.&mdash;Her Lady&s;hip had a very delicate Con&s;titution, and was afflicted with the <HI>Spleen</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, that &s;he has &s;ometimes been &s;ilent for ten

<P>THE Servants had per&s;uaded <HI>Jack</HI> to be a Member, and pay Quarteridge to a Society of <HI>Footmen,</HI> which they called a Parliament. This Convocation regulated diver&s;e weighty Matters, and rai&s;ed a Fund for the Maintenance of their Brethren <HI>out of Place.</HI> The Members took the Titles of their re&s;pective Ma&s;ters, and &s;poke and acted &s;o near their Characters, that it might be termed a <HI>Saturnalia. Jack was but</HI> too punctual a Vi&s;iter. If he improved not in his Manners by &s;uch Company, he
<PB N="18" REF="17">
thought, at lea&s;t, that he was well di|verted.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;titution of this motly Synod, with their Conduct and Re&s;olutions, mu&s;t be po&s;tponed to another Chapter, that the Chain of this Hi&s;tory may not be broken.</P>
<P>WAS our Hero intitled to an E&s;tate, his Age would permit him to enjoy it.&mdash;His Complexion, his Manner, his Voice, but above all, his generous good-humoured Di&s;po&s;ition, could not e&s;cape the piercing Eyes of Mrs. <HI>Su&s;anna Pinup.</HI> This Lady acted in the humble Station of Waiting-Woman to Lady <HI>Shallow.</HI> From her Know|ledge of &s;undry dome&s;tick Secrets, &s;he had great Power in the Family, and, as the Servants phra&s;e it, had <HI>feathered her Ne&s;t.</HI> Her great Sagacity not only di&s;covered Charms in the Per&s;on of Mr. <HI>John Con&s;tant,</HI> but that he had Money likewi&s;e.

<P>WITH the&s;e Views Mrs. <HI>Pinup</HI> began to notice our <HI>Jack</HI> in a particular Manner. She &s;hewed him every Civility; &s;he ho|noured him frequently with her Conver|&s;ation, and was &s;o intimate and gracious, that he often drank Tea in her Chamber.
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Such a manife&s;t Partiality drew on her the Re&s;entment and &s;candalous Tongues of the other Servants; but, from her <HI>exalted Seat,</HI> &s;he looked down with Contempt on the <HI>vulgar Wretches.</HI>&mdash;Mr. <HI>Buffett,</HI> the Butler, &s;eemed mo&s;t concerned, and, with a jaun|dic'd Eye, beheld this growing Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o fatal to his Hopes. This Gentleman had long &s;ighed for Mrs. <HI>Pinup,</HI> and made &s;un|dry Libations of Pints of Sack, and other choice Wines, on the Shrine of her Beauty. His Project was as exten&s;ive as it was am|bitious. He judged, that could he ob|tain the Heart of this Lady, <HI>the cheating the Family</HI> in every Branch, from the <HI>Cellar,</HI> upwards, would centre in his own Pocket. This was a Lo&s;s his Philo&s;ophy was not Proof again&s;t, and made him meditate dire Revenge.</P>
<P>Mrs. PINUP was &s;o fond of <HI>Jack,</HI> and &s;o &s;ecure of her darling Scheme, that &s;he omitted &s;ome E&s;&s;entials in bringing it to bear; for one Evening, when Prote&s;tations and Vows were plentifully be&s;towed on each other, and fervent Ki&s;&s;es and Em|braces given, and returned with mutual Ardour, the <HI>World</HI> and all its <HI>idle Ceremo|nies,</HI> were forgotten, and equal Happine&s;s cemented their Hearts without the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of any <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> except that of Love.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">MATTERS were thus conducted for &s;ome Time; but Mrs. <HI>Pinup</HI> had prai&s;ed <HI>Jack</HI> &s;o much to Mi&s;s <HI>Shallow,</HI> that &s;he longed to conver&s;e with him, and <HI>Pinup</HI>'s Cham|ber gave her frequent Opportunities. Mi&s;s <HI>Shallow</HI> was Si&s;ter to Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> and had a Fortune of Ten Thou&s;and Pounds. Her Education had been none of the be&s;t, and her Per&s;on was of that Sort, that a Man pa&s;&s;es by without noticing. However, <HI>Jack</HI>'s Vanity was &s;trangely up, and Ten Thou&s;and Pounds put a Million of Schemes into his Head, and his waking and &s;leep|ing Dreams were filled with <HI>Equipage</HI> and <HI>Splendor.</HI>&mdash;With &s;ome Difficulty and weighty Rea&s;ons, he per&s;uaded <HI>Pinup</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and Mi&s;s <HI>Shallow</HI> &s;eemed no-ways aver&s;e to his <HI>Care&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Propo&s;al,</HI> tho' the was actu|ally engaged to 'Squire <HI>Hunt,</HI> and the Mar|riage Writings drawn. In &s;hort, nothing was wanting to compleat this Affair but a convenient Opportunity, which would &s;oon have happened, had not adver&s;e Fate, in the Shape of Mr. <HI>Buffett,</HI> maliciou&s;ly in|terpos'd.</P>
<P>JEALOUSY, <HI>Envy, Intere&s;t</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI> are powerful <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> but make &s;trange Havock when <HI>united. Buffett</HI> had them all. He had never ceas'd watching the Motions of Mrs. <HI>Pinup;</HI> and his Di&s;co|veries
<PB N="21" REF="20">
were &s;uch, that they added to his Pain; but, when he found Mi&s;s <HI>Shallow</HI> was of the Party, Revenge opened an am|ple Field.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Peter,</HI> as I've before ob&s;erved, was not the brighte&s;t Genius in <HI>England;</HI> but, in Recompence, Nature had indulged him with a large Share of Pride, <HI>(that Vice of little Minds!)</HI> with which he &s;ometimes impo&s;ed him&s;elf on the World as a Man of Con&s;equence and great Importance.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Buffett</HI> knew his ruling Pa&s;&s;ion, and applied to it. On the fir&s;t Notice, the <HI>Knight</HI> &s;tormed and &s;welled with Rage; but the Butler moderated his Anger, and per&s;uaded him into Patience, until he &s;hould convince him of the Truth.&mdash;Next Evening the Lovers met; but the artful <HI>Buffett</HI> had &s;o contrived, that Sir <HI>Peter</HI> ab|ruptly entered, and caught the unguarded Pair in their innocent Embraces, and Mrs. <HI>Pinup</HI> in the Mid&s;t of a Di&s;cour&s;e on Con|&s;tancy.&mdash;<Q>Fine Doings in my Hou&s;e, <HI>cryed Sir Peter,</HI> &mdash; But I'll &s;poil your Sport, you impudent Son of a W&mdash;re.</Q>&mdash; He ran directly at <HI>Jack,</HI> but <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;s Shallow</HI> averted the Blow, and gave him an Opportunity of &s;lipping out of the Room. His Retreat was &s;o precipitate, that he did not ob&s;erve the Butler li&s;t'ning
<PB N="22" REF="21">
on the Stair-head, but drove again&s;t his Brea&s;t with &s;uch Force, that poor Mr. <HI>Buffett</HI> was hurried down a little improperly, for his <HI>Head</HI> went foremo&s;t. He fell with a mighty Noi&s;e, and the Alarm was ge|neral through the Family. &mdash; Had there been <HI>Earth</HI> or <HI>Air-quakes</HI> in tho&s;e Days, no Doubt they had all ran to <HI>Prayers,</HI> and laughed at them&s;elves for &s;o doing, when the Danger was over.&mdash;Sir <HI>Peter</HI> thundered &mdash;Mi&s;s &s;creamed, and <HI>Pinup</HI> wept &s;o loud, that my Lady with her Company, and al|mo&s;t all the Servants, filled the Room in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>THE Knight thought he acted very cun|ningly, by not telling the <HI>Whole</HI> of this Affair before &s;o many; but as he dropt &s;ome Words about Mi&s;s, and in&s;i&s;ted that <HI>Pinup</HI> and <HI>Jack</HI> &s;hould be immediately di&s;|charged, he left them all Room enough to <HI>think the wor&s;t,</HI> tho', perhaps, their Charity and Good-nature wanted not his Help.&mdash;<HI>My Lady</HI> pleaded &s;trongly for poor <HI>Pinup;</HI> yet at la&s;t &s;he was obliged to con|&s;ent, but with a Provi&s;o, that the <HI>Butler</HI> &s;hould make a Third. Sir <HI>Peter</HI> gave him up very readily, &s;o that in le&s;s than an Hour, the ill-fated Mr. <HI>Buffett</HI> lo&s;t his Cellar.&mdash;The unhappy <HI>Pinup</HI> lo&s;t all her Lover's Promi&s;es.&mdash;The unfortunate <HI>Jack</HI>

lo&s;t Ten Thou&s;and Pounds, and &mdash; next Day <HI>Mi&s;s Shallow</HI> lo&s;t her <HI>Reputation,</HI> but luckily &s;he found it on the Third, in the Arms of <HI>'Squire Hunt.</HI></P>
<P>I FORGOT to mention, that Mr. <HI>Sang|froid</HI> had been lately obliged to accompany a Nobleman to <HI>Li&s;bon;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Jack</HI> lo&s;t this <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> with his Advice and Friend|&s;hip.&mdash;When he had packed up his Goods, and re&s;igned his Livery, he found Mrs. <HI>Pinup</HI> waiting for him in the Hall, becau&s;e, as &s;he &s;aid, <Q>One Coach might &s;erve both.</Q> &mdash; They mounted, but where to drive was not determined; but at la&s;t they &s;topt in <HI>Southampton-&s;treet. Jack</HI> alighted, and &s;oon found a convenient Lodging, where the happy Pair acted the Part of <HI>Man and Wife,</HI> with great Harmony for about a Fortnight. <HI>Pinup</HI> often boa&s;ted her Riches, and tempted him, by &s;hewing Thirty Guineas <HI>in hard Gold,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Linens and Woollens,</HI> and &s;undry Gowns and Pet|ticoats.&mdash; <Q><HI>Jack</HI> was Proof again&s;t all Tears and Intreaties. &mdash; 'P&s;ha, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I've more than that my&s;elf. Marry! &mdash; we &s;hould be pretty Devils truly! No, no, Child, keep your Money, and I'll keep your Secret.'&mdash;'I don't under&s;tand, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> what you mean by Secrets. &mdash; If I have any, I believe it won't be a Secret

long.&mdash;I wi&s;h your <HI>Money</HI> was no more a Secret than mine.'&mdash;'So much for Se|crets, <HI>reply'd Jack,</HI> now for the Proof. Do you &s;ee that large Trunk, my Dear?

At la&s;t he got the better, but was &s;urprized at &s;eeing &s;ome of his Effects out of order. In a little Flutter, he &s;earch'd for his Pur&s;e, but not readily finding it, his Hurry increa&s;|ed, and he pull'd out an <HI>old Great Coat,</HI> and &s;ome tatter'd Shirts artfully mingl'd with &s;ome of his Things of little Value.&mdash;In a Word, his <HI>Money</HI> and his be&s;t Effects were vani&s;h'd. &mdash; He flew in an In&s;tant to the &s;mall Trunk, which contain'd his ordinary wear, and in which he had very oddly placed the <HI>&s;mall Box</HI> his old Friend Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> had given him, and mo&s;t of Mr. <HI>Villeneuf</HI>'s and his own Papers. Finding this &s;afe and untouch'd, he &s;at down in Silence, tho' greatly perplex'd.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"><Q>BLESS me, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Pinup,</HI> what ails the Man?&mdash;Sure, you <HI>haven't</HI> lo&s;t your <HI>Money?</HI> &mdash; Yes, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> 'tis gone, &mdash; every Shilling gone! but how, or which Way, Heaven knows!&mdash;Heaven knows! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I believe Heaven knows very well you had no &s;uch Thing, but that you've betray'd and cheated a poor innocent Woman; but &s;ince I find the&s;e are your Tricks, I &s;hall take Care of my&s;elf, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;Very well, <HI>reply'd Jack,</HI> pray proceed, for I am in a Temper to pro|voke a <HI>Saint;</HI> for I &s;ha'n't an&s;wer.</Q>&mdash;As &s;he had nothing to fear, &s;he &s;aluted him with bitter Terms, and many &s;tinging Re|proaches, till <HI>Tears</HI> interven'd, and gave him a Rece&s;s.&mdash; <Q>Since, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you are &s;o good to be &s;ilent, becau&s;e you have no more to &s;ay, pray let me be heard.&mdash;I have my Quarter's Wages in my Pocket, which will more than pay the Lodging.

<P>HOWEVER, this la&s;t Stroke of Fortune had alter'd his <HI>Thermometer,</HI> and <HI>Pride</HI> &s;unk down to <HI>extreme Humility.</HI> In this Tem|per he apply'd to Mr. <HI>Edge,</HI> a Barber, to whom he made known his Situation.

and then our Party is compleat?&mdash; Gen|tlemen, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> give me your Hands. Now I am a Brother. &mdash; Command and lead me where you plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>That Night they conducted him to their Lodging, and gave him a Hor&s;e for the Morning Expedition, and three Guineas more. They ro&s;e very early, and <HI>Jack</HI> put on a Pair of Spatterda&s;hes, examin'd his Saddle and Pi&s;tols, and found all Things in tolerable Order.</P>
<P>THE Plan of Operation was &s;ettled by <HI>Smart,</HI> but, providentially, <HI>Jack</HI> made a &s;mall Alteration. <Q>No, Gentlemen, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> let us not &s;et out together, or keep Company on the Road, as it may cau&s;e Su&s;picion; let us rather divide, and ride on to <HI>Staines,</HI> but join on <HI>Houn&s;low-heath</HI> preci&s;ely at Eleven o'Clock, when we can't fail of meeting the Coach we look for. &mdash; Be&s;ides, when &s;eparate, we may each pick up a &s;ingle Traveller to amu&s;e us before the principal Action.'&mdash;'Very right, <HI>&s;aid Smart,</HI> then I'll advance fir&s;t, <HI>Brazen</HI> will follow in half an Hour, and you will bring up the Rear in another; &s;o, Gentlemen, Good-morrow, Succe&s;s attend us.</Q>&mdash;He rode off, and <HI>Brazen</HI> but re&s;ted his proper Time.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">WHEN alone, <HI>Jack</HI> began to con&s;ider this Affair more circum&s;pectly, but not with a De&s;ign of breaking his Engagement. The Fellow, who took Care of the Hor&s;es, was no Stranger to the Expedition, and congratulated his new Ma&s;ter, on the Pro|&s;pect of making his Fortune. <Q><HI>Tim, &s;aid Jack,</HI> I have a Thought that will &s;ur|prize my Friends; if you will a&s;&s;i&s;t me I'll give your a Crown for your Trouble.' &mdash;That I will, Ma&s;ter, <HI>an&s;wer'd Tim,</HI> and be true and faithful too.'&mdash; 'Well, then, <HI>&s;aid Jack,</HI> take my Hor&s;e, and ride a little beyond the Church at <HI>Houn&s;low,</HI> and wait for me; you may depend I &s;han't keep you long. When you de|liver me the Hor&s;e, go directly acro&s;s the Heath.</Q> &mdash; <HI>Tim</HI> promis'd to obey his Orders, and &s;et forwards.</P>
<P>TWO odd Circum&s;tances happen'd to <HI>Jack.</HI> He very fortunately knew the Name of a Family that liv'd ju&s;t by <HI>Houn&s;low,</HI> of which he intended to make a proper U&s;e; and the Old Great Coat which he found in his Trunk, he had made into a <HI>Surtout,</HI> and was then on his Back. This Coat was of that Sort of Cloath that is one Side Scarlet, and the other Blue; it was &s;ingle, and not lined. This Day the Blue was out&s;ide, and the Sleeves turn'd up,
<PB N="38" REF="37">
made Scarlet Cuffs. Thus dre&s;s'd, he walk'd to <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> and took a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e to <HI>Houn&s;low,</HI> where he arrived at Ten o'Clock. With great Civility he en|quired of Mrs. <HI>Day</HI> about the Family he &s;aid he was going to vi&s;it. He call'd for a Gill of Wine, and the good Woman an|&s;wer'd all his Que&s;tions, which were &s;uch, as made her imagine he was a Relation of the Family, and had ju&s;t come from Abroad. He hinted, that perhaps he might &s;tay there a Week, or return in an Hour, when he'd be glad of a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e ready for <HI>London.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Day</HI> a&s;&s;uring him he &s;hould have one at a Moment's Warn|ing, he walk'd forward tho' with a troubled Mind, and &s;oon found his Hor&s;e. When <HI>Tim</HI> had march'd off, he turn'd his <HI>Surtout,</HI> and was now in Scarlet, with Blue Sleeves.</P>
<P>HE rode on about three Miles, and met with his Friends, who began to be in &s;ome Pain about him.</P>
<P><Q>Z&mdash;ds, <HI>&s;aid Smart,</HI> what the Devil kept you &s;o long?&mdash;but we have no Time to talk, for the Coach is at Hand. You are to keep the Po&s;tillion and Coachman in Awe; <HI>Brazen</HI> will do the &s;ame with the Servants, and let me alone for <HI>con|ver&s;ing</HI> with the Pa&s;&s;engers. When the Jobb's over, let's &s;eparate, and meet at our Lodging.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">THEY had no Time for further Delibe|ration, for the Coach drew near.&mdash; Cou|rage! <HI>cry'd Smart,</HI> and all rode bri&s;kly for|ward.&mdash;<HI>Jack</HI> did his Duty with the Po&s;til|lion;&mdash;The Servants, making a Re&s;i&s;tance, received a Fire from <HI>Brazen,</HI> which did no Harm; but the Compliment was in&s;tantly return'd, and poor <HI>Brazen</HI> fell from his Hor&s;e. Whil&s;t this was doing, <HI>Smart</HI> attack'd the Coach, but a Gentleman in it, with great Re&s;olution, &s;o nimbly, and with &s;uch Strength, turn'd his Wri&s;t, that the Pi&s;tol went off in the Air, and immedi|ately one of the Servants rode up, and knock'd him down.</P>
<P>JACK, finding two Wings of his Army taken Pri&s;oners, was determin'd to &s;ave the Remainder by a &s;peedy Flight. The Gentlemen and Servants were &s;o bu&s;y about <HI>Smart</HI> and <HI>Brazen,</HI> that he was not pur&s;u'd, but got near <HI>Houn&s;low</HI> in a &s;hort Time.&mdash; His former Caution had now its U&s;e; for tying his Hor&s;e to a Tree, a little out of the Road, he once more turn'd his Coat, and walk'd lei&s;urely on to the Inn. With a tolerable Coolne&s;s of Temper, he de&s;ir'd a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e; but accidentally a Hor&s;e was wanting, which obliged him to wait a full half Hour, which, no doubt, he thought was half an Age. He &s;ummon'd
<PB N="40" REF="39">
all his Re&s;olution to avoid Su&s;picion, and talk'd to Mrs. <HI>Day</HI> about the Family he had vi&s;ited. His Chai&s;e was ju&s;t ready when Mr. <HI>Day</HI> enter'd.&mdash;<Q>There, now, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is two fine Gentlemen that have made a noble <HI>Kettle of Fi&s;h</HI> of it this Morning.' &mdash; 'Ble&s;s me, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid Mrs. Day,</HI> what's the Matter? &mdash; Not much, <HI>reply'd her Hu&s;band,</HI> only a Coach was &s;topp'd on the Heath by three High-waymen, and two of 'em <HI>is</HI> taken, and now at next Inn.'&mdash;'Dear Sirs, <HI>&s;aid Mrs. Day,</HI> 'tis the mo&s;t <HI>prepo&s;terou&s;te&s;t</HI> Thing <HI>in Life,</HI> that Gentlefolks won't travel in <HI>Po&s;t Chai&s;e&s;es,</HI> and then they're always &s;afe from the&s;e Fellows.'&mdash;'Well, well, <HI>&s;aid her Hu&s;band,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;end after the <HI>Third</HI> who e&s;cap'd; I'll engage to find out his <HI>Scarlet Coat</HI> before Night.'&mdash; Were it not, <HI>&s;aid Mrs. Day,</HI> that the&s;e poor Creatures <HI>pay</HI> for being Taken, I am <HI>&s;ure and certain</HI> my Hu&s;band would never trouble his Head about them; becau&s;e, you know, Sir, one of the Gang will <HI>peach,</HI> and then the others <HI>hang</HI> of Cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT were the Emotions of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Soul, cannot be expre&s;s'd. He felt Ago|nies that all his former Di&s;tre&s;&s;es had never plung'd him into; but, recollecting his
<PB N="41" REF="40">
Situation, he chim'd in with Mrs. <HI>Day,</HI> and &s;poke greatly again&s;t the Di&s;turbers of the Publick.&mdash;At la&s;t, he took his Leave of Mrs. <HI>Day,</HI> mounted his Chai&s;e, and got &s;afe to <HI>London,</HI> but often thought the Hor&s;es were very bad.</P>

<P>GUILT is a <HI>Fiend,</HI> that &s;eizing the Con&s;cience, becomes a Tyrant over every Idea of Man. <HI>Remor&s;e</HI> is his Com|panion, and <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> con&s;tantly pur&s;ue his Steps. <HI>Di&s;quietude</HI> engro&s;&s;es every Thought, and even his &s;leeping Ima|gination is fill'd with Dread and Horror. &mdash;Our poor Hero is now an Object of the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;He knew not whom
<PB N="42" REF="41">
to tru&s;t, where to fly for Safety, or how to <HI>live;</HI> and he had now di&s;cover'd that he was very unfit to <HI>die.</HI>&mdash;He got to his Lodg|ing, and telling the Barber that he was engaged to a Gentleman at <HI>Hamp&s;tead,</HI> he paid a Week's Rent, call'd a Coach, and drove, with his Effects, to an Inn in <HI>South-wark.</HI></P>
<P>NOT &s;ecure in &s;o publick a Place, he found out a poor Widow in a neighbour|ing Village, with whom he agreed for Diet and Lodging. Here he was &s;afe and quiet, had his anxious Thoughts permit|ted him any Repo&s;e. A Fortnight pa&s;s'd, and he paid the poor Woman very punc|tually. She began to conceive a very great Opinion of Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> as his whole De|portment was very regular and decent. His Mind now grew &s;omewhat more calm, and his Sleep was le&s;s di&s;turb'd, for he mo&s;t &s;incerely repented of his Folly and Wickedne&s;s, and with great Fervency and Devotion, confe&s;s'd his manifold Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and humbly pray'd for <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Forgivene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Pur&s;e was extremely low. He had Thoughts of applying to &s;ome People he knew, but dur&s;t not venture to <HI>London;</HI> and his Landlady was &s;o poor, &s;he could not afford to give him Credit.&mdash;He almo&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="42">
determin'd to break his Promi&s;e to Mr. <HI>John&s;ton,</HI> and write to <HI>Lord Truegood,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Kindly;</HI> but as he knew not what Apology to make for deferring it &s;o long, or how to account for his Conduct, he was obliged to lay the Thought a&s;ide, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent.&mdash;He frequently wept mo&s;t bitterly, and bewail'd his wretched Condition. The Agitation of his Mind affected his Health, and threw him into a dangerous Fever. The poor Woman was extremely tender and careful of him, but his <HI>Soul</HI> wanting as &s;alutary Remedies as his <HI>Body,</HI> he begg'd that a Clergyman might be &s;ent for; and <HI>Doctor St. Amour,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, attended on the fir&s;t Notice. This Gentleman was one of tho&s;e who reproach many of his Profe&s;&s;ion, for he was <HI>pious</HI> without <HI>Moro&s;ene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> without <HI>O&s;tentation. Jack,</HI> tho' extremely weak, politely thank'd the Doc|tor for his Conde&s;cen&s;ion in vi&s;iting &s;o <HI>poor,</HI> &s;o <HI>wretched,</HI> &s;o <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> a Being. &mdash; The good Man, with an ea&s;y Countenance, re|ply'd.&mdash;<Q>If your Situation, Sir, is &s;o bad, I think you require, and have a natural Right to my more <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>parti|cular Attention.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Doctor pray'd by him in the true Spirit of Devotion. His Exhortations
<PB N="44" REF="43">
were &s;o fill'd with Chri&s;tian Eloquence, as warm'd and chear'd the Heart of <HI>Conyers,</HI> and in&s;en&s;ibly lighten'd his Burthens.&mdash; The Fever &s;till continued, and the Doctor never fail'd his Morning and Evening Vi&s;its.&mdash; <HI>Jack</HI> was &s;o charm'd, that he open'd his whole Soul to this good Man, and hid not the minute&s;t Part of all his Affairs &s;ince his Return from <HI>France.</HI>&mdash;The Gentleman flatter'd not his <HI>Sins,</HI> neither did he at|tempt to affright him with the di&s;mal Pro|&s;pect of <HI>endle&s;s Mi&s;ery.</HI> He &s;kilfully pro|bed and clean&s;ed his <HI>Wounds,</HI> and then pour'd in the Bal&s;am of <HI>Peace, Comfort,</HI> and Hopes of Pardon by <HI>Repentance,</HI> and a Newne&s;s of Life.&mdash;Had Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> been acquainted with <HI>one Man</HI> of Dr. <HI>St. Amour</HI>'s Character, I apprehend he would not have &s;aid, that <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Roguery go together.</HI></P>
<P>IN one of the&s;e Conver&s;ations, <HI>Jack</HI> took an Opportunity of mentioning the Promi&s;e he made to Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI> when he gave him the &s;mall Box, as &s;poken of in a former Chapter. &mdash; <Q>I am now, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;o poor, &s;o indigent, that I think I may &s;afely open the Pre&s;ent; but I am &s;o fee|ble, that I mu&s;t beg your A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> The <HI>Doctor</HI> found the Box in the Trunk, and open'd it by the Bed-&s;ide.&mdash;He pull'd out a Quantity of Straw, and, at la&s;t, a

<P>AS the Doctor read, <HI>Jack</HI> wept. The good Man could not avoid &s;ympathizing, and with &s;treaming Eyes, pur&s;ued the Di|rections of the Po&s;t&s;cript; but when he open'd a Paper nicely roll'd, and threw <HI>Twenty Guineas</HI> on the Table, poor <HI>Jack</HI> attempted to &s;peak, but his Tongue faulter|ing, he fainted on his Pillow. With &s;ome Difficulty he recover'd, and a violent Fit of Crying en&s;u'd.&mdash;<Q>Yes, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> I will obey my <HI>Father,</HI> my <HI>Friend,</HI> and my <HI>Guardian Angel!</HI> Oh Sir!

Can I be ungrateful to his Hopes?&mdash;Can
<PB N="47" REF="46">
I di&s;regard his charitable In&s;tructions?&mdash; No!

I have enquir'd par|ticularly into that Affair, and find you have nothing to dread. A third Per&s;on was indeed &s;poken of at the Tryal, but the Name of <HI>Con&s;tant</HI> or <HI>Conyers</HI> was never mention'd. Let this &s;uffice to ea&s;e your Mind.&mdash;Follow Mr. <HI>Kindly</HI>'s Advice, and be happy!</Q></P>
<P>WHEN alone, he &s;hudder'd and wept at the Fate of <HI>Smart</HI> and <HI>Brazen.</HI> He reflect|ed on the dreadful Con&s;equences of lawle&s;s Pur&s;uits. He traced back his own Life and wicked Conduct, and found, that <HI>one Vice</HI> generates another; that as they grow in Strength; they corrupt the Heart by Degrees, until the <HI>whole Man</HI> is &s;wallow'd up in Debauchery, and his Name and <HI>Na|ture</HI> eraz'd out of the Volume of the World. &mdash;<Q>How fatal, <HI>continued he,</HI> is the Begin|ning of Evil! and who can fore&s;ee the
<PB N="48" REF="47">
End?&mdash;We go on from Step to Step re|gardle&s;s of Danger. <HI>We walk on Fire cover'd with A&s;hes.</HI> No Thought, no Prudence guides. We dream of <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Delight,</HI> but, too often, awake in the Gulph of <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Perdition!</HI> &mdash; How few, like me, have prov'd an almo&s;t mi|raculous E&s;cape, and what Thanks, what <HI>Gratitude</HI> do I not owe for my Deliver|ance!</Q>&mdash;His Reflections were very ju&s;t and moving, and he promis'd to him&s;elf an entire Change of Conduct.</P>
<P>HIS Spirits began to revive, and in a few Days the Fever left him. He thank'd the Apothecary, and de&s;ir'd his Bill, but the good <HI>Doctor St. Amour</HI> had been before|hand with him. So generous was this Gentleman, that he would not permit him to mention that, or any other Obligation he lay under.&mdash;<Q>All I now want, <HI>&s;aid the Doctor,</HI> is to &s;ee you quite recovered, and then we &s;hall think of &s;omewhat for your Service.</Q>&mdash; In a Week he was perfectly well, tho' a little Pale, and when neatly dre&s;s'd, the <HI>Doctor</HI> was &s;urpris'd at his comely Appearance.&mdash;At la&s;t he propos'd an Employment to <HI>Jack,</HI> which, he &s;aid, he knew he could di&s;charge extremely well. &mdash;<Q><HI>Sir John Curious, continued he,</HI> wants a young Man, like you, to read to him,

and keep his private Accounts. I have &s;atisfied him as to your Abilities, and he is willing to give you <HI>thirty Pounds</HI> a Year. He is very old, rich and gouty, and &s;ometimes peevi&s;h, but a Man mu&s;t bear with the Infirmities of Superiors.</Q> He then proceeded in a very u&s;eful Lecture on a moral and political Conduct.&mdash;<HI>Conyers</HI> return'd him many Acknowledgements, and in two Days he took a grateful Adieu of the good Widow, and fix'd in <HI>London</HI> with the Family of <HI>Sir John Curious.</HI></P>

<P>NEVER Man began an Employment with more Plea&s;ure. He &s;eem'd as if return'd again into Life, and was de|termin'd to &s;pare no Pains in enjoying it.&mdash; His fir&s;t Care was a particular Attention to his Duty, and his next was to find out the
<PB N="50" REF="49">
Family Oeconomy, that he might adapt him&s;elf to their different Tempers.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN CURIOUS was Sixty-&s;even Years of Age, very corpulent, and ex|tremely infirm. When his Gout was not violent, he din'd with his Company, and was very chearful. From Seven to Nine at Night, <HI>Jack</HI> read to him; at Ten he went to Bed, but never ro&s;e till about Eleven next Morning. Two Servants at|tended him, and about One o'Clock, all his Flannels were remov'd, and in an old embroider'd Coat and great Wig, he &s;at in his Arm-Chair, and <HI>Jack</HI> did the Duty of his Office till Three o'Clock.&mdash;He did SIR ROBERT WALPOLE the Honour of being his Enemy, and look'd on the <HI>Craft&s;|man,</HI> equal, if not &s;uperior to <HI>Holy Writ,</HI> con&s;equently the&s;e Papers were every Mo|ment quoted. In this Choice of Books he had great Judgment, and to &s;hew it fully, he delighted in the Works of TAYLOR the <HI>Water Poet;</HI> in an old and only Tran&s;la|tion of DUBARTUS; in huge Folios of <HI>Heraldry;</HI> and when inclin'd to Sleep, in the modern Pamphlets and weekly Papers.</P>
<P>HIS Hou&s;e-Steward had a good Salary, and a certain Quarterly Sum for providing all Things for the Family. This Sum was accounted for, but could not be exceeded.
<PB N="51" REF="50">
To examine, and checque the&s;e Accounts, was part of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Duty.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN had always maintain'd the Character of <HI>A fine Gentleman.</HI> His Dre&s;s was gay, and his Manner &s;uch, that &s;up|ported the Dignity he a&s;&s;um'd. It was a Que&s;tion, whether <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Avarice</HI> had the Superiority in his Con&s;titution, but it is certain, they frequently acted in concert. <HI>Pride</HI> obliged him to a Punctuality in pay|ing his Debts, but <HI>Avarice</HI> prevented his going a Step beyond it.&mdash;<HI>Pride</HI> made him extremely <HI>Courteous, Complai&s;ant</HI> and <HI>Cere|monious,</HI> becau&s;e he lov'd to be &s;o treated him&s;elf, but <HI>Avarice</HI> &s;topp'd his Ears again&s;t the Cries of the <HI>Poor,</HI> expell'd every Senti|ment of Charity and Benevolence, and con|tracted and abridg'd &s;ome of his <HI>Vices,</HI> even when he had the Power of being <HI>Vicious.</HI> In a Word, <HI>Sir John</HI> had a <HI>Negative Cha|racter,</HI> and acquir'd the Title of <HI>a good Sort of Man;</HI> that is, his Vices were not <HI>many,</HI> but he had not a <HI>&s;ingle Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>HE had &s;een enough of <HI>one</HI> Part of the World to convince him that there was no &s;uch Thing as a <HI>mode&s;t Woman.</HI> This happy Imagination kept him a Batchelor, till, at the Age of Sixty-three, <HI>Love,</HI> or &s;ome other <HI>Mono&s;yllable,</HI> &s;tumbled into his Head. &mdash;The Charms of <HI>Mi&s;s Bridoon,</HI> his Sadler's
<PB N="52" REF="51">
Daughter, made him &s;o generous as to propo&s;e a Marriage and relinqui&s;h a For|tune. Whil&s;t this Treaty was on Foot, his Relations interpos'd, and &s;ome of his mo&s;t intimate Friends &s;poke pretty freely about it. They &s;aid, <Q>It was highly pru|dent in him to marry, but begg'd he would con&s;ider his Age and the Infirmi|ties growing on him. That a Girl of <HI>Eighteen</HI> was quite out of the Rule of Proportion. That a <HI>Mechanick's</HI> Daugh|ter was unworthy his <HI>Rank</HI> and Fortune, and an <HI>Indignity</HI> to his Family.

<P><Q>OONS, cry'd the <HI>Knight,</HI> what the Plague would you be at? I tell you, my Age is no Impediment, for I find my&s;elf as vigorous as at Twenty. If Children, <HI>not my own,</HI> inherit my <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> is it not the Practice of every Day? Is it not much better than the Heathen Scheme of Adoption?&mdash;The Honour of my Family, which my <HI>virtuous Si&s;ter</HI> makes &s;uch a Noi&s;e about, is a Farce, and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he thought &s;o, when &s;he
<PB N="53" REF="52">
ran away with my Father's Footman. Does &s;he imagine, that the Son of &s;uch a Scoundrel &s;hall enjoy my Fortune?&mdash; Then as to a <HI>virtuous Wife,</HI> I know the World too well to expect &s;uch a one, but I likewi&s;e know, that I had rather have <HI>a Part</HI> in a <HI>young Wench,</HI> than the <HI>Whole</HI> of any <HI>old Woman</HI> breathing.</Q>&mdash;In &s;hort, <HI>Sir John</HI> was re&s;olute, or rather, po&s;itive. <HI>Mi&s;s Bridoon</HI> was advanc'd to his Bed, and <HI>Con&s;ummatum e&s;t, rang through the Pari&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>LADY CURIOUS was extremely pretty. Her Eyes &s;poke, and her great Vivacity and Sprightline&s;s had attractive Qualities. &mdash;An Hou&s;e magnificently furni&s;h'd.&mdash;A Number of Servants, with Coach, Chariot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were &s;o infinitely beyond her Hopes, that her little Head began to turn. Her Con&s;titution and Soil were &s;o good, that the &s;eeds of Example grew up &s;urprizingly fa&s;t, and afforded a plentiful Crop of the mo&s;t <HI>fa&s;hionable Follies.</HI> In a &s;hort Time, &s;he had contracted a Variety of Acquaint|ance, and va&s;tly improv'd in modern Po|litene&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Plays, Operas</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;its,</HI> went a con&s;tant Round, and <HI>Drums, Routs</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> employ'd her Time, at Home and Abroad. She had a Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Play,</HI> and play'd <HI>very deep.</HI> Here, indeed, her low Birth was con&s;picuous, for, not being
<PB N="54" REF="53">
educated from her Childhood, like <HI>other Ladies</HI> of Quality, in the true Principles of <HI>Gaming,</HI> &s;he made but a &s;mall Progre&s;s in that Science, and play'd <HI>&s;o ill,</HI> and lo&s;t <HI>&s;o much Money,</HI> that her charming Com|pany was greatly courted and admir'd.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN was very indifferent about the&s;e Matters. He allow'd her <HI>two hundred Pounds</HI> a Year as Pin-Money, but was &s;o rigid and exact, that no Art, nor all her <HI>Lady&s;hip's</HI> Contrivances, could extract a Shilling more. &mdash; <HI>Conyers</HI> knew of large Sums lo&s;t at Cards, and was &s;urprized how her Lady&s;hip could an&s;wer &s;o many Demands; but at la&s;t he di&s;cover'd, that her <HI>Play-Pur&s;e</HI> was <HI>inexhau&s;tible.</HI>&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding the Multitude of Affairs, and the Variety of Employments on her Hands, &s;he found a Time to pre&s;ent to <HI>Sir John</HI> a Brace of <HI>fine Boys.</HI> Her Lady&s;hip was <HI>Happy,</HI> the old Knight was <HI>Content,</HI> and Family Affairs went on with great Har|mony.</P>
<P>IN about three Months <HI>Conyers</HI> pick'd out this Information from the Steward, and Mrs. <HI>Sieve,</HI> her Lady&s;hip's Woman. This la&s;t threw in &s;ome <HI>Nods, Winks,</HI> and <HI>In|nuendos,</HI> but the Honour of her Lady was always &s;acred. Mrs. <HI>Sieve</HI> conceived a good Opinion of <HI>Jack,</HI> and on many Oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="55" REF="54">
gave him Proofs of her E&s;teem.&mdash; He had felt the fatal Effects of &s;uch Friend|&s;hip, and was determin'd to avoid every Temptation.&mdash;He &s;hunn'd her Pre&s;ence as much as po&s;&s;ible, and even &s;lighted her Favours.&mdash;His Conduct was &s;uch an Af|front to her <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> that &s;he &s;hifted Sides, and became an implacable Enemy.</P>
<P>THIS kind Creature had laid many Schemes to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her Lady again&s;t <HI>Jack.</HI> She in&s;inuated, that his Impudence had not only dar'd to make Attempts on her <HI>Virtue,</HI> but had even mutter'd Re|flections on her Lady&s;hip. &mdash; Fir'd at his In&s;olence, my Lady determin'd to have him immediately kicked out, but the artful <HI>Sieve</HI> begg'd of her Lady|&s;hip not to <HI>di&s;parage</HI> her&s;elf &s;o much as to &s;peak of &s;uch an Affair, but to <HI>worm the the Fellow out by Degrees.</HI></P>
<P>THE Re&s;olution being taken, my Lady never cea&s;ed teizing <HI>Sir John</HI> till he grew peevi&s;h.&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Sieve</HI> affronted <HI>Jack</HI> openly, and the <HI>Steward</HI> treated him with great Impertinence. <HI>Conyers</HI> found a very vi&s;ible Change in the Countenances of the whole Family, and was made very unea&s;y in his Duty, but knew not what to a&s;cribe it to.
<PB N="56" REF="55">
&mdash;One Evening, <HI>Sir John</HI> u&s;ed him a little har&s;hly, but the Humility of <HI>Jack</HI> &s;poke much in his Favour, and oblig'd the <HI>Knight,</HI> with &s;ome good Humour, to a&s;k him, <HI>What he had done to my Lady and her Woman?</HI>&mdash; I prote&s;t, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Jack,</HI> I have done no|thing. &mdash; <Q>Nothing! <HI>cry'd Sir John,</HI> Nay then I know your Crime; you can never be forgiven.&mdash;Oons! a <HI>Hand&s;ome</HI> Fellow of your Age in &s;uch a Family as this, and do <HI>Nothing!</HI> &mdash; Thou art a &s;illy Blockhead, and I am &s;orry for it, but, <HI>Travel</HI> you mu&s;t; however, I'm deter|min'd you &s;hall &s;tay till I get you another <HI>Service,</HI> and have one in your Place.</Q></P>
<P>JACK had been &s;o accu&s;tom'd to Di&s;|appointments, that he bore this with great Temper and Re&s;ignation. He inform'd his Friend <HI>Dr. St. Amour</HI> of this Revolu|tion, and told him what was the Occa&s;ion of it, which he had learn'd from the Hou&s;e-Maid.

<P>MRS. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> and her Si&s;ter had been Coheire&s;&s;es, and had each an E&s;tate in *******, of about <HI>Five hundred Pounds</HI> a Year. The Si&s;ter had been married to Mr. <HI>Gold,</HI> a <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant, who died about four Years &s;ince, and added <HI>Fifteen thou&s;and Pounds</HI> to her Fortune. Mrs. <HI>Gold</HI> was near Thirty-&s;even Years of Age, of a noble Pre&s;ence, with great <HI>good Nature</HI> and <HI>Prudence.</HI> She continued a Widow in Spite of many Sollicitations, and &s;o affectionate|ly lov'd her Si&s;ter, that &s;he remov'd her Habitation to be nearer to her. When Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> was in Di&s;tre&s;s with his Cre|ditors, Mrs. <HI>Gold</HI> advanc'd him <HI>Six thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> on his and her Si&s;ter's Secu|rity.</P>
<P>THE Si&s;ters were almo&s;t con&s;tantly with each other, and <HI>Conyers</HI> was always of the Party.&mdash;Mrs. <HI>Gold</HI> had <HI>read,</HI> and had an excellent Under&s;tanding.

<P><PB N="63" REF="64">SOMETIMES their Entertainment was of a &s;erious Nature, and fell on the Follies of the World; &mdash; The mad <HI>Extravagance</HI> of &s;ome, and the equally mad <HI>Penury</HI> of o|thers.&mdash;On <HI>Ju&s;tice, Virtue, Charity,</HI> and the like. &mdash; Mrs. <HI>Gold</HI> &s;poke on the&s;e Heads with great Strength of Rea&s;on, and Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> enforced her Arguments by &s;undry hi&s;torical Pa&s;&s;ages, and by Accidents to which he had been Witne&s;s.

<P><Q>SCANDAL, Madam, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> let it inhabit where it will, is a <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>vulgar Vice.</HI> It is a <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>vile</HI> At|tempt to rai&s;e our own Reputation on the Ruins of another.

<P>SOME Evenings they pa&s;s'd their Time at Cards, and &s;ometimes the Ladies went to a Play, attended by <HI>Conyers.</HI> This gave Ri&s;e to a Variety of plea&s;ant Chat, where <HI>Jack</HI> &s;hew'd his Memory and good Ta&s;te, but it was a con&s;iderable Time before they di&s;cover'd he had an excellent Voice.

<P>THE Behaviour of <HI>Conyers</HI> puzzled Mrs. <HI>Gold.</HI>&mdash;She could not conceive how a Man in his Station could acquire &s;o many <HI>genteel Accompli&s;hments.</HI> She thought there was a My&s;tery in it, and when &s;he had ju&s;t de|termin'd

to find it out, <Q>Lord ble&s;s me, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> why &s;hould I trouble my&s;elf about what is not my Concern?</Q> At that In&s;tant &s;he felt a prodigious Flu&s;hing in her Face, and &s;ome Sen&s;ations &s;he had not been lately accu&s;tom'd to. She began to &s;u&s;pect the Cau&s;e, and with great Cau|tion, &s;at down to examine her <HI>Heart,</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with her&s;elf, &mdash; that is &mdash; to find out Rea&s;ons to corre&s;pond with her Inclinations. The Truth is, &s;he di&s;cover'd &s;o many, that <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Family,</HI> were fairly routed, and <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>E&s;teem</HI> got the better. She would not call it <HI>Love,</HI> as &s;he thought it a too &s;en&s;ual Term for one of her Years. She own'd &s;he regarded the <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Qualifications</HI> of Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> but the <HI>Comeline&s;s</HI> of his Per&s;on was merely accidental, and quite out of the Que&s;tion. However, that Contingent and his <HI>Youth</HI> had certainly <HI>&s;ome</HI> Weight.</P>
<P>BE this as it will, her Re&s;olution was taken, but determin'd not to proceed too ra&s;hly.

View, &s;o his Actions were <HI>Free,</HI> and with|out Re&s;erve. He had a great Regard for the Widow, which made him fond of every Opportunity of obliging her. Perhaps &s;he had ob&s;erved this, and gave it a flattering Con&s;truction. He found her mo&s;t neatly dre&s;s'd, and, for the fir&s;t Time, particu|larly remark'd her Charms.</P>
<P><Q>I AM quite a&s;ham'd, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to give Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> &s;o much Trouble for no|thing.

<P>CONYERS, unwittingly, had like to have &s;poil'd all, but Mrs. <HI>Gold's</HI> hinting, <Q><HI>One mu&s;t be civil to &s;uch Sort of People,</HI> gave him an Opportunity of &s;aying, He won|der'd of what U&s;e they were in the World.

'I &s;hall not, &s;aid <HI>Jack,</HI> affirm or deny a Thing I have not thought about, for I neither know the Lady or her Fortune; but really, Madam, I think I ought to have been exempted in your general Cen&s;ure.

<P>MRS.

<P>HE then began a Narrative of his Life, and painted his Sufferings in a very moving Manner. He artfully avoided the Place of his Birth, or the lea&s;t Hint of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as it might occa&s;ion Scandal.

<P>CONYERS promis'd to be directed by her; and Supper being &s;erv'd, a different Conver&s;ation began.

<P>'TWOULD be tedious to mention the Method &s;he took to open this Affair to her Si&s;ter. She was her own Mi&s;tre&s;s, but &s;till wanted a Sanction.

<P>THE Generality of the World regard the Actions of Men, but according to the Event.

<P>OUR Friend Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> could not avoid &s;ome few Compliments to his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> and <HI>Abilities,</HI> as they were the Motives of his Advancement; but when he reflected on the Goodne&s;s of his <HI>Wife</HI> in noticing and rewarding them &s;o amply, he di&s;cover'd, that they proceeded from a &s;uperior Cau&s;e, which, as it reach'd above his Comprehen|&s;ion, he could only wonder at, and, by <HI>prai&s;ing</HI> the <HI>Giver,</HI> make Returns of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gra|titude</HI> to the <HI>In&s;trument.</HI>&mdash;By rea&s;oning thus, and lowering his own Value as much as he heighten'd the Goodne&s;s of <HI>Providence,</HI> his Mind became more calm, and his Heart le&s;s liable to <HI>Vanity.</HI> He was not too elate, or puff'd up; for, by regarding his <HI>Wife</HI> more than her Fortune, the World was compell'd to believe he de&s;erv'd both.&mdash; Never was Woman more happy than Mrs. <HI>Conyers,</HI> and never could a Hu&s;band take more Pains to oblige a Wife.

<P>MR. CONYERS &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Brother <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> and having got in mo&s;t of his Debts, and &s;ettled all his Affairs, propo&s;ed, at the Reque&s;t of his Wife, to retire to the Country. They agreed to live in a &s;mall Town near their E&s;tate, and having pro|vided every Hou&s;hold Nece&s;&s;ary, and a good Collection of Books, they quitted the noi&s;y City, for the <HI>Peace, Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>Joys</HI> of a Rural Life. He now found him|&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of above Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year, and, calling to his Me|mory the Conduct of Lord <HI>Truegood,</HI> re|&s;olved, as near as po&s;&s;ible, to follow the Example of &s;o <HI>worthy</HI> a Nobleman. Like a prudent General, he plann'd out his Operations; he collected his Forces, and a&s;&s;ign'd to each Part a ju&s;t Proportion. His Di&s;tribution was exact; but Mrs. <HI>Conyers</HI> changed it a little, by making him &s;en&s;ible, that his Scheme had not provided for Sickne&s;s, and many other Accidents they were liable to. <Q>Let us, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> live as genteely as you plea&s;e; But where is the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of

My Ad|vice is, to &s;ave at lea&s;t <HI>Three hundred Pounds</HI> a Year, to an&s;wer Contingencies, and a&s;&s;i&s;t a worthy Friend on Occa&s;ion; neither do I &s;ee how we can well lay out the Remainder. My Life, <HI>&s;aid Jack;</HI> you are quite in the Right; then be it &s;o: It is but &s;triking out the&s;e two ex|traordinary <HI>Hor&s;es, a Servant, one Di&s;h</HI> a Day, &s;omething from the <HI>Wine,</HI> and a little from the Allowance of <HI>Cloaths</HI> and plea&s;urable Expences, and the Affair is ju&s;t as you de&s;ire.</Q></P>
<P>THE Behaviour of this Family &s;oon ac|quired the E&s;teem and Re&s;pect of the neighbouring Gentlemen and Ladies. Par|ticular Friend&s;hips were form'd, and a charming Society enlivened every Amu&s;e|ment.&mdash;Some Gentlemen met twice a Week at the be&s;t Inn in the Town, to benefit the Hou&s;e, and keep up a proper Intere&s;t, and our Friend was &s;oon invited to be of the Number. It will not be ami&s;s to mention &s;ome of this good Company.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Dob&s;on,</HI> and old <HI>Colonel Manly,</HI> were the principal. The <HI>Knight</HI> had been <HI>Member</HI> for the <HI>County</HI> in three Parliaments, as the <HI>Colonel</HI> had been for the <HI>Town</HI> for almo&s;t <HI>Forty Years.</HI> Mr. <HI>Leatherhead,</HI> Mr. <HI>A&s;h, Doctor Grace,</HI> who was Mini&s;ter of the
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Pari&s;h, and Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> made &s;ix con&s;tant Companions. Our Ladies were happy with Mrs. <HI>Grace</HI> and Family, and with Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy Manly</HI> the Daughter of the Colonel, now a mo&s;t amiable Girl of Seventeen Years of Age. Her Wit and Under&s;tand|ing, with her tender and compa&s;&s;ionate Heart, made her the Joy of her Friends. No Wonder the Colonel was extremely fond, for &s;he was the Child of his Age, and his only one. He &s;poke with Plea|&s;ure of the va&s;t Fortune he intended to leave her, and often &s;aid, he almo&s;t envy'd the happy Man to who&s;e Lot &s;he fell.</P>
<P>WITH great Care and Attention have I examined the original <HI>Memoirs</HI> of this <HI>Hi&s;|tory,</HI> but unfortunately found not the lea&s;t Hint of <HI>Amours,</HI> or, as it is called, the <HI>Gallantry</HI> of Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> during his Re&s;i|dence in the Country. This mu&s;t certain|ly be a tedious Time to a Reader of <HI>Genius,</HI> who expects at every Page, a well or ill-contrived <HI>Intrigue,</HI> or &s;omewhat wonderful or &s;urpri&s;ing to rai&s;e his Imagination, and keep up his Attention.&mdash;Tho' I cannot an&s;wer the&s;e <HI>valuable Ends,</HI> I cannot pa&s;s in Silence this Space, as my Materials are large, but mu&s;t &s;upply the Want of extra|ordinary Adventures in this &s;eeming State of Inactivity, with the Sub&s;tance of the

How could &s;uch a Tax affect the Land?'&mdash; They travel for <HI>Health</HI> or <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> and I think ought to pay <HI>Fifty</HI> or an <HI>Hundred Pounds</HI> to their own Country, for Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;pend the Remainder of their Fortunes in another. Upon my Word, <HI>&s;aid Squire A&s;h,</HI> a very notable and rea&s;onable Scheme! Then, <HI>continued the Doctor,</HI> if every Man, who accepted an Employment of <HI>One hundred Pounds</HI> a Year, was obliged to pay a <HI>Year's Salary</HI> to the State, and a propor|tionable Tax on the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Land and Sea-Officers, would it not rai&s;e a large Sum, and how would it affect our Lands?&mdash; In <HI>Holland</HI> they have what
<PB N="85" REF="88">
is called a <HI>Collateral Tax,</HI> that is, the In|heriter of a Fortune in Land or Money, not de&s;cending to him in a <HI>direct Line,</HI> pays 2 &frac12; <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the State. When they &s;ell Lands or Tenements, the Seller and Purcha&s;er pay two or three <HI>per Cent.</HI> of the Value to the Government.&mdash;Thus, Gentlemen, it is plain, there are many Ways of rai&s;ing Money, where Taxes, &s;o far from rai&s;ing our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> might be &s;o managed, as to go infinitely cheaper to Foreign Markets.</P>
<P>I ASSURE you, <HI>cried Colonel Manly,</HI> I never thought my Friend Doctor <HI>Grace,</HI> had &s;o calculating an Head, and I dare &s;ay, were the Mini&s;try acquainted with his Genius, he would &s;oon have Lawn Sleeves. I am &s;o plea&s;ed with his Money Projects, that I mu&s;t add <HI>one,</HI> which I wonder he forgot. For Example: Sup|po&s;e all the Livings of the <HI>Clergy</HI> of <HI>Eng|land</HI> were to be new valued, and the Cler|gy who &s;ucceed, after a certain Day, were obliged to pay to the Government one Year of that Valuation by four equal Payments in four Years. Would not this likewi&s;e make a large Fund? And how would it affect our Lands? Permit me to explain my Scheme by Figures.</P>

<P>Now, I would value the&s;e Livings but at Two Hundred Pounds a Year in the <HI>King's New Books,</HI> and where would be the mighty Inju&s;tice to oblige his Suc|ce&s;&s;or to pay that Sum in four Years? And how would it affect our Lands?' Were this Chamber, <HI>reply'd the Doctor,</HI> a Chamber of Parliament, I &s;hould va&s;tly di&s;appoint the Colonel, by heartily con|curring in &s;uch a Scheme, properly re|gulated, but I &s;hould certainly Vote for exempting the poor Clergy.

'Raillery apart, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> I &s;incerely think,
<PB N="87" REF="90">
&s;omewhat of this Nature ought to be done, and the <HI>Clergy of France</HI> have &s;et us very good Examples. The Wi&s;dom of Government is be&s;t &s;een in the ju&s;t Partition of Taxes. <HI>To charge them who are rich in this World,</HI> is true Policy, and to ea&s;e the poor <HI>Labourer,</HI> is equal to it. To le&s;&s;en the Tax on the Con&s;umption of the <HI>Poor,</HI> is, in Fact, an Advantage to the <HI>Rich,</HI> as all Manufactures and Workman&s;hip mu&s;t le&s;&s;en in Proportion.</P>
<P>THE Doctor mention'd, &s;aid Sir <HI>John,</HI> &s;omething of <HI>poor Clergy.</HI> I am really a&s;ham'd to &s;ee &s;o many, in &s;uch a Coun|try as <HI>England,</HI> who appear like Objects of Charity, and thought, that when QUEEN ANNE gave up her <HI>fir&s;t Fruits</HI> to buy <HI>Glebe</HI> and <HI>Impropriated Tythes,</HI> they would all have comfortable Livings; but I am va&s;tly di&s;appointed, nor can I conceive why they are not in a better Situation.' 'All I know, <HI>reply'd the Doctor,</HI> is, that the Tru&s;tees for that u&s;eful Work have had the <HI>fir&s;t Fruits</HI> and <HI>Tenths</HI> above Thirty Years. They have purcha&s;ed many Glebes, and, I dare &s;ay, from their great Virtues and high Dignities, every Thing in their Power has been done for the <HI>Good of the</HI> CHURCH, If they have not added more to the Li|vings
<PB N="88" REF="91">
of <HI>poor Clergy,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e they could get no more to purcha&s;e, or wanted a Fund.</P>
<P>FAR be it from me, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> to hint the lea&s;t Reflection on the Ho|nour or Integrity of Gentlemen in &s;uch eminent Stations, but from what the Doctor has &s;aid, and from what I have heard on this Subject, I mu&s;t conclude, that there has been no <HI>Mi&s;application</HI> of Money. On the contrary, I am in|form'd very little has been <HI>apply'd.</HI> If my Intelligence be true, a <HI>Capital,</HI> and the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of a Capital, has been &s;uffer'd to <HI>accumulate</HI> to &s;o <HI>mighty</HI> a <HI>Sum,</HI> that I am cautious to mention it. The Re|venue is certainly large, and &s;hould the <HI>Tru&s;tees</HI> not have found out Purcha&s;es, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on but that <HI>Twenty, Thirty,</HI> or <HI>Forty</HI> Pounds in Money, &s;hould be given annually to many poor Clergymen, which, I humbly apprehend, would fully an&s;wer the Intent of the charitable Donor. Whether the <HI>Tru&s;tees</HI> have expended their <HI>whole Fund,</HI> or whether they are enabled to &s;upport <HI>Twenty or Two Hundred</HI> Cler|gymen, I cannot po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert; but &s;ure I am, that as the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> would not be le&s;s manife&s;ted by a fair and hone&s;t Enquiry into it;
<PB N="89" REF="92">
&s;o I am equally &s;atisfied, that the <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>Tru&s;tees</HI> would be thus clearly demon&s;trated, and malevolent and clamorous Tongues &s;ilenced.</P>

If we beat them, I re|joice and am thankful. But to argue, that &s;ome Things ought to have been <HI>done,</HI> and that others ought to have been <HI>undone,</HI> is certainly idle, for, I profe&s;s, I believe we know nothing of the Mat|ter.' 'Right, Right, &s;aid Sir <HI>John,</HI> but you know my Rule is, never to contra|dict or di&s;pute about what I do not un|der&s;tand, e&s;pecially when I am convinc'd that my Antagoni&s;t is equally ignorant.</P>

<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my Tour through this Kingdom.

<P>IT is of little Moment to argue, whe|ther this Country is claimed by <HI>England</HI> as a Conque&s;t, or whether the Inhabi|tants threw them&s;elves under its Pro|tection?&mdash;That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> fought again&s;t <HI>Queen Elizabeth,</HI> and were often in Arms, till entirely &s;ubdued by <HI>King William,</HI> is a Matter not to be wondered at, when

<P>I AM afraid I have carried my Reader too far from the Subject-Matter of this Hi&s;tory, and try'd his Patience; but I a&s;|&s;ure him that my Indulgence has been very great; for, at infinite Pains, I have cur|tail'd the la&s;t Chapter at lea&s;t Sixty Pages. &mdash;Few know the Difficulty of <HI>Bridling</HI> the <HI>Imagination,</HI> and <HI>Reining back</HI> an hard-mouth'd <HI>Pen.</HI> It &s;ometimes gets a-head, and, in Spite of all our Skill, runs away with us into <HI>Mire</HI> and <HI>Dirt;</HI> nay, this Mi|nute I find my Quill in a Humour to gal|lop, &s;o &s;hall &s;top him &s;hort in Time.</P>
<P>THUS we have &s;een the agreeable Man|ner Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> pa&s;s'd away many Even|ings; and thus did he e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in
<PB N="124" REF="127">
the Affections of his Company, and in the Love of the Inhabitants, by many Acts of generous Charity. <HI>Colonel Manly,</HI> in par|ticular, held him in great E&s;teem, and carried his Friend&s;hip &s;o far, as to promi&s;e his Intere&s;t with the <HI>Borough</HI> for a <HI>Seat</HI> in <HI>Parliament</HI> on the fir&s;t Vacancy.</P>
<P>MR. CONYERS had now experienced perfect Happine&s;s for above a Year.&mdash;He knew the great Secret of enjoying the <HI>good Things of this World,</HI> &s;o as not to <HI>abu&s;e them.</HI>&mdash;His <HI>Fortune,</HI> his <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>agree|able Companion,</HI> his <HI>Family,</HI> and the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> of all, were the Rewards of his <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Intentions to <HI>all Mankind.</HI> In a Word, <HI>the Elements in him were &s;o mix'd,</HI> that he de&s;erv'd the honourable Title of <HI>a Man.</HI>&mdash; But this World is not made for <HI>permanent</HI> and la&s;ting Joys! &mdash; His <HI>Happi|ne&s;s, Tranquillity,</HI> and every <HI>dome&s;tick Plea|&s;ure,</HI> vani&s;h'd in a Moment, and left him as awaken'd out of a Dream of Bli&s;s.&mdash;He had a Pro&s;pect of an Increa&s;e to his Hap|pine&s;s, but the Di&s;appointment added to his Pains.</P>
<P>MRS. CONYERS was near Lying-in, but an ignorant Servant Maid telling her a mo&s;t frightful Story of the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> which had ju&s;t then broke out, threw her into a <HI>Fit</HI> and violent Tremor, which brought
<PB N="125" REF="128">
on an improper Labour. She was deli|vered of a Boy, who died &s;oon after, and in four Days the <HI>kind,</HI> the <HI>tender,</HI> the <HI>af|fectionate</HI> and <HI>agreeable</HI> Mrs. <HI>Conyers,</HI> fol|low'd her Child.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;traction and real Grief of the Family and their Friends is not to be ex|pre&s;s'd. Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> bore this dreadful Stroke like a <HI>Man,</HI> but <HI>he felt it like a Man.</HI> His Exclamations were few, but his Sighs and the Throbbings of his Heart were without Number. His <HI>inky Coat</HI> was not the only Sign of Sorrow. The invo|luntary Tear, the Heavings of his Brea&s;t, and the Alteration of his Countenance, gave vi&s;ible Marks of <HI>&s;incere Affliction.</HI>&mdash;Let me at once quit the melancholy Subject, and bring my Friend to a State of Mind a lit|tle more compo&s;ed and re&s;igned.&mdash;He a&s;|&s;ured Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> of his con|&s;tant Affection and Love, and that not|with&s;tanding his <HI>deare&s;t Wife</HI> had made no <HI>Will,</HI> he knew her Intention, and would fulfil it. Accordingly, new Writings were drawn, and he made them a Compliment of <HI>Three thou&s;and Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>HIS gloomy Countenance would have had a much longer Duration, had not the <HI>Re|bellion</HI> rous'd his Indignation. He thought his Duty to his <HI>Sovereign</HI> call'd him from
<PB N="126" REF="129">
Inaction, and the Love of his <HI>Country</HI> &s;eem'd prior to every other Regard. To be&s;tow hard Names on <HI>Rebels,</HI> and &s;upinely to &s;igh at inte&s;tine War, he judg'd, was <HI>un|manly</HI> and imprudent. He had no Idea, that the Choice of <HI>Liberty</HI> or <HI>Slavery</HI> re|quir'd a Moment's He&s;itation. Full of <HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> he unbo&s;om'd his Thoughts to the Colonel. &mdash; <Q>My dear Friend, <HI>&s;aid this venerable but hearty old Gentleman,</HI> I mu&s;t love you the more for this.&mdash;Yes, my dear <HI>Conyers,</HI> go &mdash; fight for your Country, and <HI>God Al|mighty</HI> pre&s;erve and give you Victory!&mdash; Did my great Age permit, I would be your Companion, and &s;hare in the Dan|ger.&mdash;I well remember, tho' then a Boy, the In&s;olence of a <HI>Popi&s;h Government.</HI> I remember the <HI>Seven Bi&s;hops</HI> in the Tower. &mdash;The Swarms of <HI>Friers</HI> in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park.&mdash; The Sham <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> and a thou&s;and other Enormities. &mdash; Young as I was, I follow'd my Father, and join'd the <HI>Prince of Orange.</HI>&mdash;I fought and bled for him and <HI>Liberty</HI> at the <HI>Boyne.</HI> &mdash;I fought for <HI>Liberty</HI> and KING GEORGE at <HI>Dumblain,</HI> and what Man, who has a Soul, and a Sen&s;e of our <HI>invaluable Ble&s;|&s;ings,</HI> but would venture, nay lay down his Life for <HI>them?</HI>&mdash; Now I am Old and Infirm, but my Heart is good, &mdash;indeed

He left a <HI>Will</HI> with Dr. <HI>Grace,</HI> and a Power with Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> to receive his Rents, and remitted Five Hundred Pounds to the Agent of the Re|giment, that he might draw on him as Occa&s;ions required. He concerted Mat|ters with the Colonel, and his Hor&s;es and Baggage filed off by Degrees to the next Town. He invited &s;ome Friends to Din|ner the next Day, which was <HI>Sunday;</HI> &s;o the Family was &s;ure of him for one Meal more. However, whil&s;t they were at Church, the Colonel called in his Chariot and accompany'd him, where the Hor&s;es
<PB N="131" REF="134">
attended. The old Gentleman gave him a proper Letter to <HI>his Grace,</HI> and &s;tay'd with him that Night. In the Morning he took a Soldier-like Farewell; &s;aw him &s;et out for the Regiment, and return'd in the Evening to give Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> an Account of their Expedition.</P>

<P>OUR <HI>Lieutenant</HI> &s;oon arrived at the appointed Place, and found his Re|cruits in good Order.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My very dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE this fir&s;t Opportunity of fulfilling my Promi&s;e, by laying be|fore you what my Age and Experience judge nece&s;&s;ary for your Well-doing.</P>
<P>YOU are a Man of <HI>Property,</HI> and now enli&s;ted to fight the Cau&s;e of <HI>Freedom,</HI> and of <HI>That</HI> MONARCH who has <HI>ever &s;up|ported it.</HI>&mdash;You are a <HI>Soldier.</HI> You are one of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> on whom, <HI>under God,</HI> the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> of this Nation depend. &mdash;Con&s;ider the <HI>Dignity</HI> of your Station.&mdash; Con&s;ider the <HI>mighty Tru&s;t</HI> repo&s;ed in you. Con&s;ider your&s;elf, and it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible you will err in your Conduct.</P>
<P>I AM po&s;itive as to your <HI>per&s;onal Cou|rage,</HI> for your Soul is <HI>humane</HI> and <HI>tender,</HI> and your Tongue is not a <HI>Bragart;</HI> but as your Behaviour in this new Scene of Life is what I am not &s;o certain of, your Good-nature will excu&s;e a little Advice, and attribute my <HI>Trite Maxims,</HI> more
<PB N="133" REF="136">
to the Warmth of my Friend&s;hip, than to any Occa&s;ion you may have for them.</P>
<P>TO be an <HI>Officer,</HI> there is no Nece&s;&s;ity of being in&s;pired with &s;upernatural Ta|lents. <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Deportment</HI> of a Gentleman are &s;ufficient. The Know|ledge of your <HI>Duty,</HI> and the <HI>Military Art,</HI> will come with <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Experience;</HI> but a clo&s;e Application to the Study is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE Love of the Soldiers is the Hap|pine&s;s of an <HI>Officer;</HI> and to gain <HI>that Love,</HI> the Method is &s;hort and ea&s;y.&mdash; <HI>Pay and puni&s;h where due, but never &s;trike.</HI> &mdash; Be free with your Men, but &s;uffer them not to be too free with you. An <HI>haughty,</HI> over-bearing Temper, may in|deed in&s;pire them with <HI>Fear,</HI> but never with <HI>Affection.</HI> Treat them as <HI>Men,</HI> and they will re&s;pect you as <HI>their Officer;</HI> but at the &s;ame Time, be careful that the <HI>Non-commi&s;&s;ion'd</HI> Officers act in the &s;ame Manner, and <HI>&s;upport</HI> their proper Au|thority, on which all <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> depends.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOUR, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep your Men <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>decent;</HI> it gives <HI>Spirits,</HI> and prevents <HI>Drunkenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Debauchery.</HI> &mdash; Drop in at their Meals,
<PB N="134" REF="137">
ta&s;te their Victuals, encourage them to keep good Me&s;&s;es, and reprove where you find them remi&s;s.</P>
<P>BE a&s;&s;iduous to learn the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> of a Soldier, and keep your Men diligent at it, yet &s;o as not to fatigue them unne|ce&s;&s;arily. See that they punctually obey your Commands, but be not too ri|gorous in <HI>trivial Matters.</HI> Believe me, the Men &s;oon find out the <HI>Genius</HI> of their Officers, and will never <HI>impo&s;e</HI> or play Tricks, when they know they cannot do it with <HI>Impunity.</HI></P>
<P>MAKE it a con&s;tant Rule to <HI>obey</HI> with <HI>Alacrity</HI> and <HI>Chearfulne&s;s</HI> every Order of your Superiors: Such a Conduct will add to your <HI>Reputation,</HI> and confirm your <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>SLANDER and <HI>Scandal</HI> &s;ometimes in|&s;inuate them&s;elves into Camps, and too frequently attack the mo&s;t De&s;erving. Let me beg of you to turn the deaf Ear to <HI>evil Report,</HI> and not be &s;peedily <HI>pre|judiced</HI> again&s;t any Man, much le&s;s your Commanders.</P>
<P>IF an <HI>Officer</HI> need not have all the <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> of a Privy-Coun&s;ellor, he ought, at lea&s;t, to have that Part that enjoins <HI>Se|crecy.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb is good:&mdash; <HI>In a clo&s;ed Mouth no Flies enter.</HI>&mdash;Execute
<PB N="135" REF="138">
your Orders in Silence, and let not the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;tant Hint,</HI> of the Conduct of the Army, e&s;cape from your <HI>Lips</HI> or your <HI>Pen.</HI> Should you know nothing parti|cular, your Words mu&s;t be mere Con|jecture, and, in all Probability, quite wrong. Should a material Circum&s;tance come to your Knowledge, what <HI>Infamy</HI> mu&s;t follow your di&s;clo&s;ing it!</P>
<P>COMPANY and <HI>Chearfulne&s;s</HI> are ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, but to <HI>drink</HI> to <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> is inexcu&s;able. The <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> depend on the <HI>Sobriety</HI> of <HI>Officers.</HI>&mdash;How can a <HI>Drunkard</HI> guide Men truly, when his own Legs <HI>mutiny,</HI> and refu&s;e his Com|mands?</P>
<P>BE <HI>charitable;</HI> be <HI>generous</HI> according to your Power; but &s;eldom give <HI>Money</HI> to a Soldier. When you think proper to <HI>Reward</HI> or <HI>Encourage,</HI> there are other Ways infinitely more u&s;eful to them.</P>
<P>RISE early, and examine your Com|mand; keep them rea&s;onably employ'd, and under the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t Di&s;cipline;</HI> but let your <HI>own Example</HI> keep Pace with your <HI>Precepts.</HI> Have all your Affairs in &s;o <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>exact</HI> an Order, as to be always <HI>ready</HI> to march at a Moment's Warning. All Men ought to accu&s;tom them&s;elves
<PB N="136" REF="139">
to <HI>Regularity;</HI> but none requires it more than a <HI>Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR natural <HI>good Temper</HI> will prevent your giving <HI>Offence</HI> to any One, and per|haps incline you to bear patiently <HI>tho&s;e</HI> offered to you; but <HI>have a Care,</HI> and let what will be the Con&s;equence, permit no Man to <HI>Taunt</HI> or <HI>In&s;ult</HI>&mdash;Should the lea&s;t Particle of <HI>Contempt</HI> fall on you, quit a Service, where you mu&s;t do <HI>more Harm</HI> than <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>WITH regard to your <HI>pre&s;ent Enemies,</HI> hold them not <HI>too cheap.</HI>&mdash;Speak of them as Men of an <HI>unhappy Education,</HI> led away by <HI>fal&s;e Maxims,</HI> and prejudiced to <HI>erroneous Principles:</HI> They are, or ought to be, our <HI>Brethren.</HI>&mdash;Let your <HI>Humanity</HI> extend to them as far as <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Pru|dence</HI> will permit. If ab&s;olute and <HI>fatal Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> compels you to &s;trike, let the Sword fall from no other Motive but the <HI>General Good.</HI> &mdash; Let it be <HI>effectual,</HI> but <HI>in&s;tant.</HI> &mdash; In that unhappy Ca&s;e drive every <HI>Womani&s;h Weakne&s;s</HI> from your Heart, and con&s;ider, that too much <HI>Le|nity</HI> and <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> may be Cruelty to your Country.&mdash;The <HI>Action,</HI> or nece&s;&s;ary Pur&s;uit over, let <HI>Clemency</HI> and <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> fill your Brea&s;t.&mdash;Should you <HI>conquer,</HI> be all <HI>Mildne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> &mdash;Comfort the

<P>But I have done, and di&s;charged the Office annexed to <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> If my Hints are u&s;ele&s;s to you, perhaps you may know tho&s;e to whom they may be of Service.</P>
<P>I SEND you my old faithful Companion <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Feuquiere.</HI> Read him care|fully, for he is able to in&s;truct. I like|wi&s;e &s;end you <HI>Polibius,</HI> with the Annota|tions of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Follard.</HI></P>
<P>YOU find I am an <HI>old Fellow</HI> by my long-winded Tale; but I &s;hall appear more &s;o, when you con&s;ider I end, (where I ought to have begun) by recommend|ing to you the Service of <HI>God,</HI> and Obe|dience to his Ordinances.

a Paper, that I &s;uppo&s;e &s;erv'd as <HI>Memoran|dums</HI> and Hints to Mr. <HI>Conyers.</HI> It was dated like a Journal, but gave me little In&s;ight into Affairs.

THEY WERE WEIGH'D IN THE BALLANCE, AND FOUND LIGHT.</P>
<P>WHEN he reflected on the happy Con|&s;equences of the <HI>Glorious Day.</HI>&mdash; When he con&s;idered, that <HI>Freedom, Liberty, Religion,</HI> and <HI>his Maje&s;ty's Augu&s;t Family</HI> were more firmly e&s;tabli&s;h'd and confirmed to <HI>Great Britain.</HI>&mdash;That a full Period was put to <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Slaughter,</HI> and to that <HI>unnatural Mon&s;ter,</HI> CIVIL WAR, his Heart <HI>exulted,</HI> and his <HI>Joy</HI> was extreme. &mdash; He very de|voutly returned his Acknowledgments to <HI>that Providence,</HI> which had &s;o often and &s;o &s;ignally pre&s;erved our <HI>invaluable Privi|leges,</HI> and had protected him in the Mid&s;t of &s;o many Dangers.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="144">HE wrote a particular Account of this Battle to Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> and <HI>Colonel Manly.</HI> He va&s;tly extoll'd the <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>General,</HI> and the <HI>Valour</HI> of the Troops.

<P>HE greatly commi&s;erated the unfortu|nate Pri&s;oners, now &s;ubject to the <HI>injured Laws</HI> of their Country. To avert the Pu|ni&s;hment due to &s;uch <HI>Crimes,</HI> was not in his Power; but to make them ea&s;y, and alleviate their Sorrows, was his daily Em|ployment.&mdash;He lay'd no Stre&s;s on <HI>Victory,</HI> as it is an uncertain Determination of <HI>Right</HI> or <HI>Wrong;</HI> but he argued in the gentle&s;t Terms, and endeavour'd to convince them, from <HI>Hi&s;tory, Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> that their <HI>Prejudices</HI> were ill founded. &mdash; That, they were <HI>Dupes</HI> to the Politicks of <HI>France,</HI> and acted like <HI>Children</HI> who di&s;obey the be&s;t of <HI>Parents.</HI>&mdash;That as Criminal as they were, <HI>his Maje&s;ty</HI> was cloathed with <HI>Mercy,</HI> and advi&s;ed an immediate Application to his <HI>Clemency.</HI>&mdash;He &s;hewed them the Good|ne&s;s of the <HI>late King</HI> in 1715, and very judiciou&s;ly referred them to the Memoirs of <HI>Marchal Villars,</HI> and many other <HI>French</HI> Books, for the oppo&s;ite Conduct of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth to his <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Subjects in the <HI>Cevennes,</HI> who had <HI>taken Arms</HI> merely to defend their <HI>Religion,</HI> not to <HI>dethrone</HI> their <HI>Monarch.</HI>&mdash;Such a Conduct made Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> va&s;tly beloved, and brought &s;ome,

who were <HI>violent,</HI> to think with more <HI>Mo|deration.</HI> He greatly pity'd the <HI>poor Clans,</HI> as they were bred up in a blind and <HI>im|plicit Obedience</HI> to their <HI>Chiefs.</HI> He lament|ed tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who acted from <HI>Con|&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Principle,</HI> but regarded tho&s;e, as the mo&s;t <HI>wicked</HI> of human Beings, who&s;e only Motive was <HI>to fi&s;h in Troubled Waters.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="146" REF="149">AS your <HI>Cowardice</HI> and <HI>Infidelity</HI> were the Ruin and Subver&s;ion of our augu&s;t Hou&s;e, we tru&s;t hat the &s;ame Principles are capable of <HI>re&s;toring</HI> us to the Throne of our Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>TO obviate every Difficulty to the&s;e our ju&s;t and laudable Purpo&s;es, we &s;hall, by the Authority afore&s;aid, convince this Nation, that our Rule will be &s;alutary, and extend to the Happine&s;s of every Individual.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Habeas Corpus Acts</HI> are equally dangerous, and &s;hall, with the Advice of Friends, be abrogated or &s;u&s;|pended, until a Regulation can be made, and the <HI>Holy Inqui&s;ition</HI> introduced into the Kingdom.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>Grand</HI> and <HI>Petty Juries</HI> are the greate&s;t Evils of Civil Government, they &s;hall be aboli&s;hed, and the Judges, whom we &s;hall think proper to appoint, &s;hall finally hear and determine all cri|minal Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>PROCESSES in Civil Affairs are mo&s;t &s;hamefully and abominably abu&s;ed. The Deci&s;ion of <HI>Property,</HI> as now managed, is a Matter that greatly affects our hu|mane Heart, and until a proper Method can be fixed on for abridging the Laws, we &s;hall take the conte&s;ted <HI>Lands</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> into our Care and Guardian&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="150">THE In&s;ufficiency of the <HI>Statute</HI> and <HI>Common Law</HI> of <HI>England</HI> ab&s;olutely re|quire an Explaining and a <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ing</HI> Power. We &s;hall therefore, once more, e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>Star Chamber-court</HI> in its fulle&s;t Extent.</P>
<P>THE many Evils ari&s;ing from Clan|de&s;tine Marriages is a Scandal to the Nation, and Ruin to many Thou&s;and Families. To remedy which, we &s;hall immediately erect a <HI>Court of Wards,</HI> as in the Days of our illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THE Education of Youth is a Matter of the highe&s;t Importance. Our Vigi|lance &s;hall watch over tho&s;e mighty Se|minaries <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge.</HI> Their Learning is too crampt and confined, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Mandamu&s;es,</HI> we &s;hall throw in &s;uch Fellow Labourers from the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> and <HI>St. Omers,</HI> as will &s;oon in|culcate our grand De&s;ign.</P>
<P>LIBERTY is the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing Man can enjoy; but the Abu&s;e of that Liberty the greate&s;t Cur&s;e: To avoid the latter, and yet keep &s;trictly to the former, it is our &s;incere and determin'd Re&s;oluion, to indulge every Man in the peaceable and quiet Liberty of THINKING. Neverthe|le&s;s, tho' we would &s;hew our great Mo|deration and Lenity, our true Intent and
<PB N="148" REF="151">
Meaning is, That &s;hould any Per&s;on pre|&s;ume to do more than merely THINK, he &s;hall not only incur our highe&s;t Di&s;|plea&s;ure, but be delivered to the <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Juri&s;diction,</HI> over whom we do not pretend to have any Power, con&s;equently the Door of our natural Clemency will be &s;hut again&s;t him.</P>
<P>FROM our unbounded Charity to weak and tender Minds, and in Imitation of our illu&s;trious Grandfather, (of ble&s;&s;ed Memory) it is our firm Re&s;olution to grant a <HI>plenary Indulgence</HI> and full <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience</HI> to all Sects and Religions what&s;oever; that they &s;hall exerci&s;e and enjoy all their re&s;pective Rites and Ce|remonies in the ample&s;t Manner, until the <HI>true and infallible Church</HI> has taken Root, and &s;pread its Branches, <HI>but no longer.</HI></P>
<P>THE Liberty of the Pre&s;s is an Abo|mination in the Sight of God and Man. Such Power in the Hands of Unbelievers and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> gave Ri&s;e to vile Writings and Infinity of Bla&s;phemies again&s;t the mo&s;t Highe&s;t; nay, it has dared to open its Mouth again&s;t the <HI>Maje&s;ty of Kings:</HI> &mdash; To contemn and make odious that great Bulwark of Monarchy, The ancient Sy&s;tem of <HI>Divine, Hereditary</HI> and <HI>inde|fea&s;ible

<P>AS no true Son of the Church can with Patience hear of the Havock and Deva&s;tation the Hou&s;e of TUDOR made of her Lands and Revenues, nor of the many Robberies and Impieties commit|ted in tho&s;e barbarous Times again&s;t the <HI>Holy See,</HI> and the cloi&s;tered Saints whom God had &s;o plentifully &s;cattered over the Land, our Pious Intention is, &s;o &s;oon as Affairs will permit, to rein&s;tate our <HI>Holy

<P>IN fine, Let us conjure you by the Duty you owe God's Hereditary Vicegerent: By the Love of Peace and Tranquillity, and by the Honour of our &s;upreme and infallible Judge, to hear and con&s;ider the&s;e our real and &s;incere Purpo&s;es, &s;trip|ped of any the lea&s;t Di&s;gui&s;e.&mdash;Con&s;ider our Situation. &mdash; Regard our Sword!&mdash; Con&s;ider, That the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King is our Support; the Mo&s;t Catholick our Helper; and tho&s;e in the Mountains A&s;&s;ertors of our Right.&mdash;Let therefore no <HI>un&s;anctify'd Bi&s;hop</HI> preach you from your Duty, but remember the Happi|ne&s;s, the mighty Happine&s;s we intend to be&s;tow upon you, and be a&s;&s;ured on the Faith of a Family who <HI>never forfeited their Word.</HI>&mdash; On the Faith of a Family, who&s;e <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Heroick</HI> Deeds are &s;o fully recorded in your Hi&s;tories, that we

<P>DOMESTICK Peace was once more e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the late confu&s;ed and di&s;tracted Kingdom now more &s;en&s;ibly felt the Joys of publick Tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE War with <HI>France</HI> &s;till raged in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and required the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e Troops, which a Rebellion had com|pelled
<PB N="152" REF="155">
to withdraw from their Allies, and the nece&s;&s;ary Orders were di&s;patched for embarking &s;undry Corps. Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> was pre&s;ented to a Troop of Dragoons under the&s;e Orders. He now equipt him&s;elf in a much better Manner, and was &s;o em|ployed, that he had not Time to vi&s;it his Friends; but contented him&s;elf with tender Letters to Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> Colonel <HI>Manly,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Grace.</HI>&mdash;When the Regiments were compleated, the final Orders were given, and Captain <HI>Conyers</HI> attended his Duty.</P>
<P>HE certainly ob&s;erved a profound Si|lence on the Military Operations, for I only found &s;ome Orderly Books, written in his own Hand, which, undoubtedly, every Of|ficer ought to do.</P>
<P>FOR the Marches and Encampments of the Army, I mu&s;t refer to the Gazettes of the Time.&mdash;As I ever con&s;ult the Ea&s;e of my Reader, he will not condemn my Si|lence, when he con&s;iders I have no Lights to guide either Him or my&s;elf into Affairs &s;o much above our Knowledge.&mdash;However I mu&s;t follow the Glimmerings I have, and pur&s;ue him through his Variety of Marches and foraging Parties, till I find him en|camped near <HI>Mae&s;tricht.</HI> I mu&s;t attend him in cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> with the Army,
<PB N="153" REF="156">
and encamping in the Vicinity of the <HI>French,</HI> but, even to the Night before the la&s;t Battle, I have nothing particular to mention.&mdash;This Night, indeed, an Affair happened, which makes &s;o material a Part of this Hi&s;tory, that compels a Recital, tho' with my u&s;ual Brevity.</P>
<P>THE Captain had been ordered, with Detachments from other Regiments, on a Command to <HI>Venlo,</HI> for Forage. Di&s;putes frequently happen on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, which the Commanding Officer mu&s;t be extremely careful to prevent.&mdash;By an Of|ficer's in&s;i&s;ting to be &s;erved out of his Tour, a Quarrel began: The Clamour was great; but the <HI>Captain</HI> running to the Spot, ex|erted his Authority, and directed the Fo|rage in the proper Channel. The Officer who&s;e Name was <HI>Thornton,</HI> and a Lieute|nant of Dragoons, was much out of Hu|mour, and dropt &s;ome Words, as much as to &s;ay&mdash;Captain <HI>Conyers</HI> would not be al|ways at the Head of a Command!</P>
<P>THE Foraging being over, they return|ed to <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> where the Captain found an Order, from the Adjutant-General, to join the Army as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, after the Men and Hor&s;es were refre&s;hed. He communicated this Order to the Officers of the Party, and directed them to join at
<PB N="154" REF="157">
the Port, preci&s;ely at Two o'Clock in the Morning. The&s;e Orders were given to the Men, and he invited the Officers to &s;up with him at the <HI>Helmet,</HI> and Lieutenant <HI>Thornton</HI> was of the Party. This Gentle|man was younger than Captain <HI>Conyers,</HI> but in his Size, and many other Re&s;pects, extremely re&s;embled him. He had a very good Character in the Army, but was too apt to imagine an Affront where none was intended. As he was well liked for many good Qualities, this Fault was imputed to his Youth, and Want of Experience.</P>
<P>LIEUTENANT <HI>Thomas</HI> was likewi&s;e of the Company. He was an elderly, rough Sort of a Man, who, from a low Station, had, by Accident, arrived to this Rank. He was educated, and took his Degrees, in a <HI>Stable,</HI> and, forgetful of the <HI>Title</HI> he was honoured with by <HI>his Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Com|mi&s;&s;ion, &s;wore and talked as if &s;till a Dra|goon.&mdash;This Gentleman began the Affair of the Forage, and &s;eemed to think that Lieutenant <HI>Thornton</HI> had been injured.&mdash; <Q>By the L&mdash;d, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if any Man had &s;erved me &s;o, I'd have &s;hewn him the <HI>Difference.</HI>&mdash;Sir, <HI>reply'd Mr. Thornton,</HI> I know as well as any Man, <HI>when</HI> I am ill u&s;ed, and &s;hall take a proper Time to explain my&s;elf.'&mdash; 'Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="158">
who began to be warm, I don't know the Meaning of all this; but &s;hould you imagine any ill Treatment, I beg you will &s;hew the Manner, and you &s;hall find me va&s;tly ready to give you every <HI>Sa|tisfaction</HI> in my Power.&mdash; 'Spoke, <HI>cry'd Thomas,</HI> like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour.' &mdash; Sir, <HI>&s;aid Thornton,</HI> &s;ince I mu&s;t &s;peak, I mu&s;t tell you, I am a Gentleman of Family and Fortune, per|haps, &s;uperior to your &s;elf! You in&s;ult|ed me at <HI>Venlo;</HI> you &s;topt my Men in their Duty, in a rude and uncivil Man|ner. This, Sir, may injure my Charac|ter and Honour, and calls for immedi|ate Satisfaction.' &mdash; 'That's right, <HI>&s;aid Thomas,</HI> the pre&s;ent Time is always the be&s;t, therefore, my Advice is, to take a cool Turn on the <HI>Parade,</HI> and decide the Matter like <HI>Friends</HI> and Men of <HI>Ho|nour.&mdash;Thornton</HI> ro&s;e up, as did Captain <HI>Conyers.</HI></Q>&mdash;The re&s;t of the Company in|terpo&s;ed, and contrary to all Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s Arguments, obliged them to &s;it down in Peace.</P>
<P>THE young Lieutenant was on fire, and the Captain almo&s;t as hot; but a little Re|flection brought him to his Rea&s;on.&mdash;Gen|tlemen, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> I am &s;orry for this Affair, and believe I can convince Mr.
<PB N="156" REF="159">
<HI>Thornton</HI> of a mi&s;taken <HI>Point of Honour.</HI>&mdash; <Q>By the L&mdash;d, <HI>&s;aid Thomas,</HI> your only <HI>be&s;t Way,</HI> is, by the Point of the Sword.</Q> &mdash;Sir! <HI>&s;aid the Captain, with a &s;trong Em|pha&s;is,</HI> Did I affront you, too?&mdash;<Q>No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid Thomas,</HI> not me.'&mdash; 'Then, Sir, <HI>re|ply'd the other,</HI> let me advi&s;e you, as you regard your Commi&s;&s;ion, or your Safety, no more to interfere in our Di&s;putes.</Q>&mdash; <HI>Thomas</HI> bit his Lips, but, prudently held his Tongue.&mdash;<HI>Conyers</HI> turned to Mr. <HI>Thorn|ton,</HI> and &s;aid,&mdash; <Q>You have de&s;ired Sati&s;|faction, Sir, and it is my Duty to give it, but permit me fir&s;t to &s;ay, I think you began at the wrong End. What Satisfaction could my <HI>Life</HI> have afforded you, or your <HI>Death</HI> have given me, your Family or Friends? &mdash; I hope we have had Time to reflect on the Con&s;equences of too precipitate a Re&s;olution.' &mdash; 'Sir, <HI>reply'd Thornton,</HI> the Honour of an <HI>Officer</HI> is a tender Point.' &mdash; 'I confe&s;s it, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> and therefore ought to be tenderly u&s;ed.&mdash;No Satisfaction, Sir, can equal a Conviction of being in an Error. &mdash;Here, Sir, are the Orders I received, and &s;ubmit to the Gentlemen pre&s;ent, if I exceeded them, or &s;hewed the lea&s;t Partiality.</Q>&mdash;The Company agreed, that he could not avoid acting as he did; <HI>and
<PB N="157" REF="160">
he proceeded:</HI> &mdash; <Q>As to your Family and Fortune, they are in this Ca&s;e, quite out of the Que&s;tion. I own, Sir, I was in an Hurry to prevent a Di&s;pute; but if any Expre&s;&s;ions of Rudene&s;s or Incivi|lity e&s;caped from me, I am &s;orry for it, and before the&s;e Gentlemen, mo&s;t hear|tily a&s;k your Pardon. This, Sir, I hope, is the <HI>rational</HI> and ju&s;t <HI>Satisfaction</HI> one Gentleman ought to a&s;k of another; if <HI>more</HI> is required, I mu&s;t comply, tho' with Reluctance.</Q></P>
<P>ALL the Company, except <HI>Lieutenant Thomas,</HI> who was a&s;leep, cryed out, &mdash; <HI>No Gentleman can de&s;ire more,</HI> and greatly prai&s;ed <HI>Captain Conyers.</HI> &mdash; Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> confe&s;&s;ed his Error, excu&s;ed him&s;elf for his Ra&s;h|ne&s;s, and begged that no more might be &s;aid about it.&mdash;The <HI>Captain,</HI> affectionately embracing him, wi&s;h'd for an Opportu|nity of &s;hewing his Regard and Friend|&s;hip.&mdash;<Q>What Pity it is, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that <HI>tri|vial</HI> and <HI>in&s;ignificant</HI> Words &s;hould rai&s;e our Anger, to the De&s;truction of our <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> and that Incendi|aries are not more &s;everely puni&s;hed.&mdash; Had not this good Company been more prudent than <HI>Two of us,</HI> and hone&s;ter than a <HI>Third,</HI> One might, by this Time, have &s;lept with his Fathers, and perhaps
<PB N="158" REF="161">
both. &mdash; But, come, Gentlemen, let us prepare for Duty where <HI>real Honour</HI> calls. Let us fight with the <HI>common Enemy,</HI> but never among&s;t our&s;elves. &mdash; One Bottle more and then.' &mdash; 'And then, <HI>&s;aid Mr. Thornton,</HI> have at the <HI>French.</HI></Q> &mdash; They fini&s;hed two Bottles with great Harmony, and often drank Succe&s;s to the DUKE, and preci&s;ely at the Time appointed, marched out of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and &s;oon arrived at the Camp.</P>
<P>THIS proved a very <HI>bu&s;y Day,</HI> and made the &s;mall Village of LAWFELD Famous.&mdash; Tho&s;e who de&s;ire an Account of the Bat|tle, mu&s;t not apply to me, for my whole Attention is taken up with Capt. <HI>Conyers.</HI> &mdash; When our <HI>Dragoons</HI> were ordered to Charge, the <HI>Captain</HI> did &s;ingular Service. He re&s;cued his Major, and a Lieutenant-Colonel of another Regiment.&mdash;He &s;top|ped &s;everal Parties who were driving to their Ruin, and directed them where to turn their Swords. &mdash; His <HI>Head</HI> and his <HI>Hands</HI> were at Work, and in &s;hort, as the <HI>French</HI> Memoir Writers phra&s;e it, <HI>He per|formed Prodigies</HI> of <HI>Valour.</HI>&mdash;In the Mid&s;t of this, he &s;aw Lieutenant <HI>Thornton,</HI> with the greate&s;t Bravery, waging unequal War, for he was &s;urrounded by three Cavaliers. &mdash;In an In&s;tant, he flew to his Relief, and
<PB N="159" REF="162">
effectually took Care of one. By this Time Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> was wounded in many Places, and on the Ground; the <HI>Captain</HI> received a violent Blow on his Head, and two Wounds on his left Shoulder. His Hor&s;e was &s;hot, but he manfully defended the Body of his Friend on Foot. Finding the Foe encrea&s;ed, he de&s;ired <HI>Quarters,</HI> and re&s;igned his Sword to an Officer who had ju&s;t come up.&mdash;At fir&s;t he imagined Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> was killed; but ob&s;erving &s;ome Signs of Life, he per&s;uaded &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> to carry him to a Place of Safety, and was conducted along with him by the Officer, who was a Gentleman of great Humanity. All po&s;&s;ible Care was taken of both; and, the Action over, they were &s;ent to <HI>Tongres</HI> with other Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman to whom he had &s;ur|rendered, was the <HI>Marquis de Bri&s;&s;ac,</HI> Co|lonel of a Regiment of Dragoons. His Politene&s;s and good Manners, corre&s;pond|ed with his Quality. He daily vi&s;ited the Captain, and procured him and Mr. <HI>Thorn|ton</HI> every Nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;The Lieutenant had been &s;everely treated, having no le&s;s than &s;even Wounds in the Head, Shoulders, and Body. Two of them were dangerous, but his Youth and good Con&s;titution &s;urmount|ed the Difficulty. In three Weeks the Sur|geons
<PB N="160" REF="163">
declared him in a fair Way of Re|covery; but it would require great Time.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Marquis</HI> was extremely plea&s;ed, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very genteely on the Occa&s;ion. He a&s;&s;ured him, that a&s;&s;i&s;ting two &s;uch valiant Gentlemen was the highe&s;t Proof of his good Fortune.&mdash; <Q>Tho' I was not, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> a Witne&s;s of your Bravery, I am &s;ure it mu&s;t have been great, but the Courage of the <HI>Captain</HI> in defending you, is what I &s;hall ever e&s;teem and ad|mire him for. To his Valour you really owe your Life, more than to my En|deavours to &s;ave it.</Q></P>
<P>AS our two Pri&s;oners recovered their Strength, the <HI>Marquis</HI> introduced them to the <HI>Duke d'Ayen,</HI> with other Officers of Family and Di&s;tinction, and every Polite|ne&s;s and Re&s;pect was paid them.&mdash; They had now their own Servants and Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and a Credit for Money. In two Months Capt. <HI>Conyers</HI> was in good Health, but his Left Arm was u&s;ele&s;s. He got Permi&s;&s;ion, on his Parole, to go to his Re|giment, but promi&s;ed his Friend to return &s;oon, and, if po&s;&s;ible, go with him to <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> which was nece&s;&s;ary for both.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Conyers</HI> was received with the greate&s;t Joy by his Corps, and highly ho|noured by his Superiors. He &s;poke of
<PB N="161" REF="164">
Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> in &s;o noble a Manner, that the DUKE gave him a Troop of Dragoons, and Permi&s;&s;ion to both, to go to <HI>Aix,</HI> or where they thought proper, to e&s;tabli&s;h their Healths. Capt. <HI>Thornton</HI> was extreme|ly &s;en&s;ible of the Bounty and Goodne&s;s of <HI>his Royal Highne&s;s,</HI> and affectionately em|bracing <HI>Conyers,</HI> called him his <HI>Father, Bro|ther</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;erver,</HI> and vow'd a perpetual Friend&s;hip. Capt. <HI>Conyers</HI> was not behind Hand, and promis'd to attend him, and, if po&s;&s;ible, never to part.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Capt. <HI>Thornton</HI> was able to travel, the Friends took their Leave of the <HI>Marquis de Bri&s;&s;ac,</HI> the <HI>Duke d'Ayen,</HI> and others, in the polite&s;t Terms, and te&s;tified their Gratitude for all the Civilities recei|ved. Capt. <HI>Thornton</HI> could not think of going to <HI>Aix</HI> till he had paid his Duty to the <HI>Duke,</HI> and ki&s;&s;ed that Hand which had &s;o nobly rewarded his little Services. He met with a mo&s;t gracious Reception, and in a few Days left the Camp.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Thornton</HI> was the Second Son of Sir <HI>Roger Thornton,</HI> a Gentleman of large Fortune in <HI>Ireland</HI> and in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons. He was about Twenty-four Years of Age, &s;poke <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> perfectly well, and under&s;tood <HI>Drawing,</HI> and tho&s;e Branches
<PB N="162" REF="165">
of the Mathematicks, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to every Officer who choo&s;es to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> allowed him Three Hundred Pounds a Year, but on this Occa&s;ion he very liberally &s;upplied him. He wrote Capt. <HI>Conyers</HI> a mo&s;t obliging Letter, for his Son had informed him of the Obliga|tions he lay under. The young Captain received many Letters from his Uncle the <HI>Earl of Mountworth,</HI> in which Mr. <HI>Conyers</HI> was always honourably mentioned.</P>

<P>ON their Arrival at <HI>Paris,</HI> they hired very grand Apartments in the be&s;t <HI>Hotel.</HI> In a few Days they were prepared to vi&s;it the <HI>Marquis de Bri&s;&s;ac</HI> and the Duke <HI>d'Ayen,</HI> who received them with Marks of the greate&s;t Re&s;pect and E&s;teem. They were vi&s;ited in Return, and &s;oon made ac|quainted with the Families of the Fir&s;t Di&s;tinction. The <HI>Marquis</HI> recommended the able&s;t Surgeon, and they went on very &s;ucce&s;sfully under his Care.</P>
<P>THEY had been about a Month at <HI>Paris,</HI> when one Day Capt. <HI>Conyers</HI> took it into
<PB N="164" REF="167">
his Head to dre&s;s him&s;elf as formerly, and dine at the <HI>old Ordinary.</HI> The People of the Hou&s;e immediately recollected him, and were much rejoiced at his Return&mdash; It &s;eems <HI>Paris</HI> had greatly mi&s;s'd the <HI>Engli&s;h Guineas</HI> that &s;o plentifully roll'd about be|fore the War, and now promi&s;ed them|&s;elves that <HI>my Lord Anglais</HI> would &s;oon pay the Expence of all their <HI>Fireworks</HI> and Illuminations.&mdash;He found none of his for|mer Acquaintances at Table; but after Dinner he begg'd the good Woman would accept of a Pot of Coffee, and enquired after them.</P>
<P><Q>MONSIEUR <HI>Maquereau, &s;aid &s;he,</HI> had very bad Fortune at <HI>Play,</HI> and was &s;o reduced, that for &s;ome Time he lived on the Women of the Town; but at la&s;t he got <HI>Religion</HI> into his Head, and went into <HI>La Trappe.</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Chevalier Fanfaron</HI> was very unlucky, for about a Year ago he <HI>died of his Wounds.</HI>'&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;aid Co|nyers,</HI> the <HI>Chevalier</HI> had an Affair of Ho|nour, and fell by it.' &mdash; 'All I know, <HI>&s;aid the Landlady,</HI> is, the <HI>Chevalier</HI> killed a Gentleman one Night on <HI>Pont-Neuf,</HI> and was &s;o unfortunate as to be taken and <HI>broke Alive</HI> on the Wheel, at <HI>the Greve.'</HI>&mdash;'So much for the Chevalier, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> but you don't tell me
<PB N="165" REF="168">
a Word of my good Friend <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pen&s;&eacute;.</HI> I hope no Accident has happened to him.'&mdash; 'Ah, poor Gentleman! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> indeed, he is greatly to be pity'd. 'Tis now ju&s;t two Years &s;ince the <HI>Archers</HI> got into his Lodgings, took him out of Bed, &s;eized all his Papers and Effects, and carry'd them to the <HI>Ba&s;tile.</HI> God knows if he be dead or alive. Some|body &s;aid he was a <HI>Spy</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and &s;o the poor good Man was ruined.</Q></P>
<P>THE Captain enquired for no more, but fini&s;hed the Coffee, thank'd the good Wo|man, and went in a Hurry to his Lodg|ings. He was va&s;tly moved at the Fate of <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;,</HI> and determin'd to try his Intere&s;t to &s;ave him, if it was not too late.&mdash;He &s;oon dre&s;s'd, and follow'd Captain <HI>Thorn|ton</HI> to the <HI>Marquis</HI>'s, where he had dined. The Company were informed of the Morn|ing <HI>di&s;habill&eacute;</HI> and imputed it, and his long Stay, to &s;ome Affair of <HI>Gallantry,</HI> on which he was heartily railly'd. He railly'd in his Turn, and the Conver&s;ation fell into the u&s;ual Channel. The Duke <HI>d'Ayen</HI> came in &s;oon after, and in a little Time the whole Company went to the <HI>Opera.</HI></P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Conyers</HI> took Care to place him&s;elf next to the <HI>Duke,</HI> and at la&s;t found an Opportunity of mentioning the Ca&s;e of
<PB N="166" REF="169">
<HI>Pen&s;&eacute;.</HI> He concluded with a&s;&s;uring his Lord&s;hip, that he held the Office of a <HI>Spy</HI> in the utmo&s;t Contempt: <Q>But, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> this unhappy Man has formerly render'd me more Services than I can ever repay; therefore I hope your Lord&s;hip will con|&s;ider the Gratitude I owe, and grant a Favour to me, and not to him.'&mdash;'I pro|te&s;t, <HI>&s;aid the Duke,</HI> I never heard of this Man, but all in my Power you may command. I &s;hall &s;peak to my Father, <HI>(Mar&s;hal Noailles)</HI> and intere&s;t my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t. Should I &s;ucceed, you &s;hall &s;oon hear of it, but my <HI>Silence</HI> will con|vince you of the Impo&s;&s;ibility.</Q></P>
<P>CONYERS pa&s;s'd four Days in great Anxiety, but the fifth he had a Vi&s;it from the <HI>Duke,</HI> who, after &s;ome Conver&s;ation, told him, his Friend was alive.&mdash; <Q>Then, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> &s;o am I. This is a great Point gain'd; but I hope more remains.'&mdash; 'Yes, <HI>reply'd the Duke,</HI> I will not keep you longer in Su&s;pence. The <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> with &s;ome Difficulty, un|dertook the Cau&s;e, and I have brought you an Order to the <HI>Governor,</HI> to deliver Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> and all his Effects, into your Hands, but with this Injunction, that he quits <HI>Paris</HI> in twenty-four Hours, and <HI>France</HI> in a Week.</Q>&mdash;The Captain took
<PB N="167" REF="170">
the Order, and mo&s;t heartily thank'd the Duke.&mdash; <Q>I know not, <HI>&s;aid this Nobleman,</HI> how <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> e&s;caped, for he has been a mo&s;t notorious Offender; but his Art was great, and by little Di&s;coveries pro|tracted his Time &s;o long, that I believe, at la&s;t, they were a&s;hamed to hang him. &mdash;But I &s;ee you are impatient to be the Me&s;&s;enger of good News, and &s;hall only add, that I expect you To-morrow at Dinner.</Q>&mdash;He was in the highe&s;t Delight, and immediately drove to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> ac|companied by Capt. <HI>Thornton.</HI></P>
<P>THE proper Compliments being paid to the <HI>Governor,</HI> the Captain mentioned Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;,</HI> but was an&s;wer'd civilly, tho' in a cold un&s;atisfactory Manner.&mdash; <Q>Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> I believe I have a Paper in my Hand, that will convince you I am not here to a&s;k impertinent Que&s;tions.</Q>&mdash; When the Governor had read and care|fully examin'd the <HI>Order,</HI> he behaved quite in another Manner, and directed a Servant to call Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> to him.&mdash;He &s;poke much of the poor Man, but &s;eem'd to hint, that all Things con&s;ider'd, he had &s;urpri&s;ing good Fortune.&mdash;<HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> was conducted into the Chamber, but his Countenance was &s;o changed, that his Friend &s;carcely knew him.&mdash;He bow'd and trembled. &mdash; A &s;mall
<PB N="168" REF="171">
Silence intervened, but, fixing his Eyes in|tently on Captain <HI>Conyers,</HI> and, at la&s;t, cre|diting their Evidence, he cry'd out.&mdash;<HI>It is he,</HI> and flew to his Arms. He hung on his Neck. He had not Words to te&s;tify his Amazement. He cla&s;p'd him, and was in an Agony of Joy, till Tears moderated the Exce&s;s. He &s;obb'd, and a&s;k'd broken Que&s;tions, every Moment embracing his Friend.&mdash;The Scene was very moving, nor could the <HI>Captain</HI> refrain the manly hone&s;t Tribute of a Tear.</P>
<P>THE Governor told Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;,</HI> that he was at Liberty to go with the Gentlemen. That his Papers were &s;ealed up, as was the Value of his Effects in a Box, which he might take with him; but gave him the Orders about quitting the Kingdom. &mdash; Mr. <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> made many Compliments, but &s;eem'd to wi&s;h he was out of the Walls, which Half an Hour &s;aw done; and the Captain conducted him to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>AS his Time was to be &s;hort in <HI>Paris,</HI> they abridg'd a thou&s;and Que&s;tions to each other, and re&s;erved them for a more fa|vourable Opportunity, only the <HI>Captain</HI> mention'd the Situation he was in, as to Rank and Fortune, which gave the old Man a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure. &mdash; They now ex|amin'd his <HI>Finances,</HI> and found he had a
<PB N="169" REF="172">
Remainder of &s;ix hundred Pounds <HI>Sterling.</HI> They debated on the Application of the Money, but found, that the mere Intere&s;t would by no Means afford him a decent Maintenance. &mdash; <Q>My dear Friend, <HI>&s;aid Pen&s;&eacute;,</HI> let me &s;ettle this Affair.&mdash; Take the Money, and allow me what you think proper, by way of Pen&s;ion, during my Life.</Q>&mdash;Be it &s;o, <HI>reply'd the Captain,</HI> and immediately he drew up a little In&s;trument, and gave him a Letter to his Banker in <HI>London,</HI> to honour his Bills for <HI>twenty-five Pounds for every three Months.</HI>&mdash;Poor <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> once more &s;hed Tears, and could only add &mdash;<HI>You are too good, and I am too happy.</HI></P>
<P>MANY Towns were propo&s;ed for his Re&s;idence, for to <HI>England</HI> he could not &s;afely go, and the Captain fixed on <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> as a cheap and agreeable Place. Matters being thus adju&s;ted, they pa&s;s'd the Re|mainder of the Day to their mutual Sa|tisfaction; and next Morning <HI>Pen&s;&eacute;</HI> bid Adieu to his faithful Friend, and took the Coach to <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> but not before the Cap|tain had obliged him to accept of <HI>Forty Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS I ought to extol the Good|nature of Capt. <HI>Conyers:</HI> &mdash; To paint his Friend&s;hip in the brighte&s;t Colours, and to &s;hew the Amiablene&s;s and Self-Satisfaction
<PB N="170" REF="173">
of a grateful Heart.&mdash;By &s;o doing, &s;hould I not deprive my Reader of the Plea&s;ure of doing it him&s;elf? &mdash; When I con&s;ult my own Ea&s;e, 'tis only with a View of indulging his Judgment.</P>

<P>CAPT. <HI>Thornton</HI> was not yet quite cured; for his Wounds, by &s;ome lit|tle Irregularities, had frequently opened. Capt. <HI>Conyers</HI> was perfectly recover'd; and as his Regiment had been for &s;ome Time in <HI>England,</HI> he began to con&s;ider that his Duty required his Pre&s;ence. Whil&s;t he was preparing to attend it, he received a Letter that gave him Pain and Plea&s;ure. In &s;hort, the Regiment was <HI>broke.</HI> He was now his own Ma&s;ter, and determin'd to &s;tay with his Friend till he was quite fit to Travel.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="174"><Q>SINCE, &s;aid he, that I am now at full Liberty, and have an ea&s;y Fortune, ought I not to think on tho&s;e Friends to whom I owe my very Being? Perhaps that dear good Man Mr. <HI>Kindly,</HI> or &s;ome of his Family may want my A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash; Perhaps I may be u&s;eful to the worthy Lord <HI>Truegood,</HI> or his charming Sons. Heavens! what a Joy mu&s;t I not feel at contributing to their Satisfaction! What Plea&s;ure will they not receive at &s;eeing their little <HI>Jack</HI> completely happy! &mdash; Ought I not to think on my Mother? Ought I not to &s;eek her out, and relieve her Di&s;tre&s;&s;es? and have I not neglected the&s;e Duties too long?</Q>&mdash;Such Thoughts made him glow with alternate Shame and Plea&s;ure, and determin'd him to vi&s;it <HI>Ire|land</HI> as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE Captains pa&s;s'd their Time in <HI>Pa|ris</HI> in the mo&s;t agreeable Manner, and were much re&s;pected by the Ladies. I find a few Hints that per&s;uade me, they were not without Amu&s;ements of a delicate Nature; but as the Papers are &s;ilent as to the Parti|culars, &s;o mu&s;t I.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that Capt. <HI>Magragh</HI> of Lord <HI>Clare</HI>'s Regiment, had lately taken Apart|ments in the &s;ame <HI>Hotel.</HI> This Gentleman thought it his Duty to pay his Re&s;pects to
<PB N="172" REF="175">
the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers, and made them a very civil Vi&s;it. They received him in a polite Manner, and in an Hour's Conver|&s;ation found out his <HI>Rank</HI> and his Charac|ter. He was of a lively Soldier-like Di&s;|po&s;ition, and very communicative. His Father had quitted <HI>Ireland,</HI> and follow'd the Fortune of <HI>King James the Second.</HI> He was born in <HI>France,</HI> but &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with a prodigious <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Accent, tho' he had ne|ver been in that Kingdom. He told them of the va&s;t E&s;tate his Father lo&s;t in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and how near he was, the other Day, of recovering it. He &s;poke of the War in <HI>Germany</HI> and in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and gave them a Hi&s;tory of his own Exploits. He men|tioned the Valour of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and without con&s;idering the <HI>French Policy,</HI> &s;eem'd to glory in their being &s;ent foremo&s;t on the mo&s;t de&s;perate Attacks. His Conver&s;ation, and the Oddity of his Language, was agree|able enough, and made our Friends de&s;ire a further Acquaintance.</P>
<P>IN a few Days he invited them to a gen|teel Supper, with two other Officers of the <HI>Iri&s;h Brigade.</HI> The Chat turn'd on War, and Capt. <HI>Magragh</HI> &s;poke very eloquently on <HI>Sieges</HI> and <HI>Battles,</HI> for he could really &s;peak on little el&s;e.&mdash;One of the Officers, in a laughing Way, mention'd &s;omething of
<PB N="173" REF="176">
an unfortunate Expedition into <HI>Spain,</HI> which obliged the Captain to enlarge upon it. <Q>Gentlemen, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you my fatal Story. You mu&s;t know, that my Father's Brother, that is, my Uncle by the <HI>Father's Side,</HI> was a Merchant at <HI>Cadiz.</HI> He was as rich as a thou&s;and <HI>Jews,</HI> and always promi&s;ed to make me his <HI>Son and Heir,</HI> but &mdash; the Devil fire all Prie&s;ts! About &s;eventeen or eighteen Years ago, a Son of a Whore, one <HI>Fa|ther Kelly,</HI> came over from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and brought his Si&s;ter with him. She was the Widow of one <HI>Squire Connor,</HI> and young and hand&s;ome enough. What will you have of it, but my fooli&s;h Uncle got acquainted with this <HI>Father Kelly</HI> and his Si&s;ter, and by my own <HI>Sowle</HI> he married her. To be &s;ure I wrote to my Uncle, and <HI>towld</HI> him what a <HI>Fool</HI> he was, and what a <HI>Rogue</HI> he was to cheat a Gentleman <HI>like me,</HI> and his own <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI> The old Fellow was very &s;aucy, and by my own <HI>Sowle</HI> I had a great Mind to go to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>beat his Coat.</HI> Well, Gentlemen, about two Years agon I got a Letter from a Friend at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that my Uncle was growing &s;ickly; &s;o I took Po&s;t, thinking to make it up with him, but by my <HI>Sowle,</HI> I <HI>was
<PB N="174" REF="177">
late,</HI> for the old <HI>Teef</HI> hid him&s;elf under Ground. Now, will you believe it? The Devil take me, and I &s;wear by him that made me, if the old Rogue left me a <HI>grey Groat.</HI> I &s;poke to <HI>Madam my Aunt,</HI> and <HI>towld</HI> her of my Journey, and my great Expences, and of the Wrong &s;he did me, and the like, and only begg'd her to let us fairly divide the Money be|twixt us. The Lady began to laugh, but &s;aid, &s;he had &s;ome Commi&s;eration on me, and made &s;ome fine Speeches; but the Devil a Farthing would &s;he give but <HI>four hundred Pi&s;toles.</HI> I took the Money, and giving her a hearty Cur&s;e, wi&s;h'd her and her <HI>thirty thou&s;and Pound</HI> at Hell.'&mdash;'You had hard Fortune, in|deed, <HI>&s;aid Capt. Thornton;</HI> but perhaps &s;he may make you Amends &s;ome Time or other.' <HI>Sir, reply'd Magragh,</HI> I &s;hall never trouble her <HI>no more.</HI> I am now a Captain in the <HI>fir&s;t be&s;t</HI> Regiment in <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> I have the <HI>Cro&s;s of St. Lewis,</HI> which the King gave me, becau&s;e I <HI>wouldn't</HI> be kill'd at <HI>Philip&s;bourg,</HI> and I have a <HI>Royal</HI> Donation of <HI>three hundred Livres</HI> a Year; &s;o, my Dear, what do I want? I love my Friends, and my good Friends love me; and I vow to God, I am as happy as the <HI>King him&s;elf,</HI> God ble&s;s him. I
<PB N="175" REF="178">
love my Countrymen the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and I love the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> well enough, but <HI>Faith and Sowle,</HI> they are too hard upon us.</Q></P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Thornton</HI> ob&s;erv'd a peculiar Gravity in the Countenance of his Friend, and thought, by changing the Current of Conver&s;ation, to remove it. He try'd many Ways, but <HI>Conyers</HI> &s;eem'd lo&s;t in Thought. His Silence gave a &s;erious Turn to the Company, and they broke up much &s;ooner than was intended.</P>
<P>NEXT Morning Captain <HI>Thornton</HI> had a very early Vi&s;it from Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> for he had not &s;lept. &mdash; <Q>My dear <HI>Thornton, &s;aid he,</HI> you mu&s;t wonder at my Behaviour, but I in&s;i&s;t on your Friend&s;hip, and beg you will not require an Explanation of the only Thing I cannot divulge.</Q>&mdash; <HI>Thornton</HI> imagin'd a Quarrel, and ro&s;e in a Hurry to &s;top his going out of the Room. His Friend could not forbear laughing at his &s;erious Figure, but a&s;&s;ur|ing him on his Honour, that a Quarrel was the lea&s;t in his Thoughts, the other was pacify'd and returned to his Bed.&mdash;<Q>I am, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> in the odde&s;t Situation, per|haps, ever Man was in. I am far from unhappy; but &s;ome Doubts and Anxi|eties &s;o much torment me, that I cannot be at Peace till they are &s;atisfy'd.' 'Dear
<PB N="176" REF="179">
<HI>Conyers, &s;aid the other,</HI> I hope you will indulge me with my Share of what gives you Unea&s;ine&s;s; I think I have a ju&s;t Claim to it.&mdash;'I believe, <HI>reply'd Conyers,</HI> your Friend&s;hip is &s;incere; but my Ca&s;e is of &s;uch a Nature, that as you cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I mu&s;t only de&s;ire your Pati|ence.</Q></P>
<P>HE revolv'd a thou&s;and Projects to bring about his Affair in the propere&s;t Manner. He remember'd <HI>Father Kelly,</HI> and call'd back every Circum&s;tance of his Childhood &s;o clearly, that he had not the lea&s;t Doubt but Mrs. <HI>Magragh</HI> was his Mother.&mdash;He reflected on her Features, and brought her Face familiar to his Imagination. He own'd &s;he had not been the tendere&s;t of Parents, but <HI>Nature</HI> &s;poke, and threw her Faults into the mo&s;t favourable Light. He ardently wi&s;h'd to embrace her, and, as his filial Affection aro&s;e, the tender Tear fell down his Cheeks. The good, the hu|mane Heart, will not call this an unmanly Weakne&s;s. &mdash; The Sen&s;ations of his Soul were natural, and the re&s;ult of an hone&s;t Mind. At la&s;t he determin'd on a Jour|ney to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and went immediately to Mr. <HI>Waters,</HI> his Banker, for proper Let|ters.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="180">WHILST he was &s;peaking to this Gen|tleman on the nece&s;&s;ary Credit he might want, he took an Opportunity of a&s;king him if he knew Mr. <HI>Magragh,</HI> who had been a Merchant at <HI>Cadiz.</HI> <Q>Yes, Sir, <HI>reply'd Mr. Waters,</HI> extremely well, for he was my Corre&s;pondent many Years.' I hear, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> he has left a Widow, and &s;hould be glad to know if &s;he be alive.' 'She was &s;o, very lately, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Banker,</HI> for I have had Let|ters from her about &s;ome Effects remain|ing in my Hands. I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he is a very notable Woman, and va&s;tly rich.' As for her Riches, <HI>&s;aid Conyers,</HI> I have nothing to &s;ay; but you would much oblige me, by recommending me to her Notice and good Offices, in a friendly Manner; and likewi&s;e for another Let|ter, wherein you will plea&s;e to mention me as her <HI>near Relation.</HI> This la&s;t I &s;hall only make U&s;e of, in ca&s;e I find her really &s;o.</Q> Mr. <HI>Waters</HI> very readily com|ply'd, and promis'd to be very &s;ecret in the Affair.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Conyers</HI> was now much ea&s;ier in his Mind, and the Alteration in his Conduct, gave a very &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure to his Friend, but it was of &s;hort Duration, for he inform'd him, that he was oblig'd
<PB N="178" REF="181">
to &s;et out immediately for <HI>Madrid,</HI> where his Stay &s;hould be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible. Captain <HI>Thornton</HI> was oblig'd to acquie&s;ce, and Preparations were made for his Jour|ney. The <HI>Marquis de Bri&s;&s;ac</HI> was &s;urpriz'd at the Project of Mr. <HI>Conyers,</HI> but got him Recommendatory Letters to the <HI>French Mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> and advis'd his travelling with the King's Me&s;&s;enger, e&s;pecially as he &s;eem'd in Ha&s;te. &mdash; A Me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patch'd the Week following, who had Orders to take particular Care of the Captain.&mdash;He took a Servant with him, and, with &s;ome Reluctance, bid adieu to his Friends.</P>

<P>AN Account of a Journey, <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be very un&s;atisfactory to a Reader, and tire and fatigue him as much as the Traveller.

Mrs. <HI>Ma|gragh</HI> read the Letter, and with great Po|litene&s;s, a&s;&s;ur'd him of her Re&s;pects, and Readine&s;s to &s;erve him.

her Complexion. &mdash; He frequently caught him&s;elf too earne&s;tly looking at her, and very often met her Eyes.</P>
<P>NEXT Day the Company din'd at her Hou&s;e. Mirth and Good-humour abound|ed, and each &s;trove who &s;hould add mo&s;t. Mrs. <HI>Magragh</HI> &s;hew'd a more than com|mon Civility to the Captain, and often re|peated, that he had much of the Air of a Gentleman who had been a very <HI>dear Friend</HI> to her and her Family.

<P>MR.

<P>NO doubt Mrs. <HI>Magragh</HI> was impa|tient to hear the Story of her Son, and begg'd he would begin, and not omit the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances. He obey'd, and carried her through every Scene of his Life, except a few Parts not &s;o fit for her to hear, and concluded, by his being a Captain of Dragoons; the Accident that brought him to the Knowledge of her be|ing alive, and how &s;oon he determin'd to pay his Duty.&mdash;He did not mention his being on <HI>Half-Pay,</HI> le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;taying at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> which he by no Means intended to do.&mdash;He recited all his Adventures in a full and clear Man|ner, and &s;o pathetically worded his Suffer|ings,
<PB N="188" REF="191">
that &s;he wept mo&s;t bitterly, but, his good Fortune &s;ucceeding, a vi&s;ible Joy &s;pread over her Countenance. &mdash; She em|braced him a thou&s;and Times, and ble&s;t God for re&s;toring to her a Son, and a Son of &s;uch <HI>Prudence</HI> and &s;o many <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> my dear <HI>Jack,</HI> it is but ju&s;t to recount my own Hi&s;tory, and in|form you of &s;ome Things that you are a Stranger to.</P>
<P>SHE then began from her being a Ser|vant at Sir <HI>Roger Thornton</HI>'s. &mdash; <Q>In this Family, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I lived very happily. I was <HI>young,</HI> and tolerably <HI>hand&s;ome,</HI> and it plea&s;ed <HI>Sir Roger</HI> to think me more &s;o than perhaps I really was. He made me Pre&s;ents, &s;eem'd very fond of me, was a mighty fine comely Gentleman; and, in &s;hort, overcome my fooli&s;h Weakne&s;s. I proved with Child, and he married me to <HI>Jerry Connor.</HI> You came into the World with that Name, but my dear <HI>Jack,</HI> your real Father was <HI>Sir Roger Thornton.'</HI>&mdash; 'More Wonders! <HI>cry'd her Son,</HI> &mdash; Is it po&s;&s;ible! &mdash; She &s;eem'd &s;urpri&s;ed at his Exclamations, but he inform'd her of his Intimacy with Captain <HI>Thornton,</HI> and of the Accident that brought on their great Friend&s;hip. She was va&s;tly delighted with this In|cident,
<PB N="189" REF="192">
and charm'd to find <HI>Sir Roger</HI> was &s;till alive.</Q></P>
<P>THIS obliged her to begin a little more particularly, and &s;he continued her Ac|count to the Death of <HI>Jerry Connor,</HI> and the Parting with her Son.&mdash;As I have pla|ced all the&s;e Facts in the fir&s;t Pages of this Hi&s;tory, where I imagin'd they naturally came in, I mu&s;t refer my Reader to them, and take up her Story where I dropt it.</P>
<Q><P>THUS, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Father <HI>Kelly</HI> and I co|habited in a &s;candalous Manner; and the Proofs again&s;t us were &s;o &s;trong and &s;o many, that he could not live in the Country. His Uncle the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> gave him a good Sum of Money, and a Let|ter to a <HI>Prior</HI> of a rich <HI>Convent</HI> in this City. He per&s;uaded me to go with him, (and I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tay behind) but he would by no Means con&s;ent to my taking you. I was in the utmo&s;t Trouble, and could not think of parting with my Child for ever. At la&s;t he propo&s;ed &s;ending you to his Brother's in the County of <HI>Galway,</HI> who would take care of your Education, and, at a certain Age, &s;end you to <HI>Cadiz.</HI>&mdash;The barbarous Wretch laid the Scheme, and expo&s;ed you to peri&s;h on the Road. He was &s;o
<PB N="190" REF="193">
cruel, that he never would give me the lea&s;t Satisfaction, or let me know what he had done with you. I was too much depending on him to quarrel, and had no other Con&s;olation but my frequent Tears.</P>
<P>WE embark'd at <HI>Cork</HI> in a Ship load|ed with <HI>Beef, Tallow,</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;ted Stuffs,</HI> and arrived &s;afe at this Place. It was agreed I &s;hould pa&s;s for his <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> and the Widow of one Mr. <HI>Connor</HI> of <HI>Clonmell.</HI> He went to the Convent, and deliver'd his Letter to Father <HI>Purcell</HI> the <HI>Prior,</HI> where I believe he was well received, for he return'd va&s;tly plea&s;ed. He was &s;oon in the Habit of his <HI>Order,</HI> and provided me a Lodging in a good Family, and made me dre&s;s in a very decent Man|ner.</P>
<P>I KNOW not how he managed with the <HI>Prior,</HI> but he gave me to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t call him my <HI>Uncle,</HI> and be extremely civil when he vi&s;ited me, and next Day I had that Honour. Father <HI>Purcell,</HI> or rather my <HI>Uncle,</HI> was a comely, grave Man, of about <HI>Sixty,</HI> va&s;tly polite, and courteous, and, &s;eemingly, of a mo&s;t <HI>religious</HI> Deportment. However, my pi|ous <HI>Brother</HI> &s;oon hinted, that I was to be more than <HI>merely civil</HI> to him, if I ex|pected
<PB N="191" REF="194">
to be maintain'd.&mdash;What could I do?&mdash;I was compelled to forfeit my <HI>Ho|nour,</HI> that I might &s;ave my <HI>Reputation.</HI> In &s;hort, I comply'd, and my <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Uncle</HI> con&s;tantly vi&s;ited me, and were <HI>mighty tender</HI> and <HI>affectionate Rela|tions.</HI></P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, my deare&s;t <HI>Jack,</HI> I hide not from you, even my own Shame.&mdash;How are the be&s;t In&s;titutions perverted! but let us not condemn the <HI>Whole</HI> for the Wickedne&s;s of a <HI>Few.</HI>&mdash;Thus I lived for about four or five Months, and was vi&s;ited by the be&s;t Families, and paid them in Return. I own I was not a fit Companion for People of Fortune; but as I could not conver&s;e in their Manner, I behaved with great <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Silence.</HI> This procured me a general good Cha|racter, and made me pa&s;s for what I did not merit.</P>
<P>I HAD a Mind to try the Temper of Father <HI>Purcell,</HI> and one Day very gravely hinted an Apprehen&s;ion of my being with Child. The <HI>old Man</HI> &s;tared, and was in a &s;trange <HI>Dilemma,</HI> for he had no Notion but Father <HI>Kelly</HI> was my real <HI>Brother.</HI>&mdash;He walk'd about the Room in a very pen&s;ive Manner, but at la&s;t &mdash; Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if my dear Widow be with Child, I mu&s;t find a Father for it.

&mdash;Shall I get you a Hu&s;band? &mdash; 'I have no Objection, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> provided he be a good one.'&mdash;"Leave it to me, <HI>re|ply'd the Prior;</HI> but it mu&s;t be done in a Hurry, and &s;hall in&s;tantly &s;et about it; &s;o put on your be&s;t Airs for a Vi&s;it To-morrow Evening." &mdash; 'I took his Advice, but could not forbear laughing at the Oddity of my Scheme, and won|der'd where it would end.</P>
<P>FATHER PURCELL kept his Word, and introduced Mr. <HI>Magragh.</HI> He &s;eem'd a plain good Sort of a Man, of about Fifty-five. He was very ceremo|nious and complai&s;ant, but &s;poke little.

<P>MR. MAGRAGH was really a good-natur'd inoffen&s;ive Man, and very af|fectionately lov'd me. I kept very good Company, I read a good deal, and wrote, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him very much in his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. By Degrees I grew very expert, and began to <HI>think</HI> and <HI>talk</HI> in a quite different Manner.&mdash;My poor Hu&s;band was extremely delighted with my Dili|gence and Capacity, and only wanted a <HI>Child</HI> to compleat his Happine&s;s; but none came, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>frequent</HI>

<P>THUS I liv'd for about five Years, with great &s;eeming Happine&s;s; but your Image, and Father <HI>Kelly</HI>'s Per&s;on, were <HI>too often</HI> pre&s;ent to make me really &s;o. I dreaded his more than <HI>Brotherly Love;</HI> for he &s;ometimes vi&s;ited at very impro|per Sea&s;ons. I knew his Temper, and, as he began to be &s;u&s;pected on many Ac|counts, particularly for &s;ome Intrigues with <HI>Spani&s;h Ladies,</HI> I was in continual Apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome fatal Accident. Nay, I much fear'd the Jealou&s;y of the <HI>Prior,</HI> for he gave me &s;ome Hints. At la&s;t I mi&s;s'd the Vi&s;its of my <HI>Brother,</HI> and enquir'd after him from my <HI>Uncle.</HI> He &s;hook his Head, but no &s;atisfactory An&s;wer came. I cry'd for my <HI>Brother,</HI> but I never &s;aw him &s;ince.&mdash; He was ei|ther <HI>murder'd,</HI> or carry'd to the <HI>Inqui&s;i|tion,</HI> and I violently &s;u&s;pected the <HI>Prior.</HI> &mdash;I was really &s;orry for his Misfortune, but not di&s;pleas'd at the Lo&s;s of his Com|pany.

<P><PB N="196" REF="199">THESE Impediments to the Tranquili|ty of my Mind being remov'd, I ap|ply'd my&s;elf more clo&s;ely to the Study of every Thing that might give my Hu&s;|band Plea&s;ure.

with the Ladies.&mdash;<HI>It is ju&s;t</HI> They <HI>&s;hould peculiarly admire the</HI> Brave, <HI>when</HI> They only <HI>are capable of rewarding them.</HI></P>
<P>LADY MOUNTWORTH &s;till pre&s;erved a large Re&s;idue of Beauty.

Perhaps &s;he was too delicate in the Choice of a Hu&s;band, and required more Perfections in a Man, than a <HI>large Fortune</HI> and <HI>high Titles.</HI> She was &s;o whim&s;ical and &s;ingular in her No|tions, that &s;he thought a <HI>rational, tender,</HI> and <HI>faithful Companion,</HI> was infinitely more e&s;&s;ential to a Scheme of Happine&s;s, than a Multitude of Servants, and the mo&s;t bril|liant Retinue.&mdash;My <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Lady</HI> often raillied this Temper; but as they knew her Under&s;tanding and Judgment, they always left her Free.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Conyers</HI> admired her Virtues. He was charmed at the <HI>ea&s;y Elegance</HI> of her Conver&s;ation. He gazed on her Beauties,

<P>THO' <HI>Lady Harriot</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Imagi|nation, yet his private Affairs were attended to.

<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Thornton</HI> had been &s;o long ab|&s;ent from his Regiment, that he was oblig'd to take Leave of his Friends, and join his Po&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and his Father Sir <HI>Roger</HI> had been &s;ome Time in <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> on Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.

<P>COLONEL MANLY was &s;till hearty, and tolerably well.

Truegood.</HI> He was &s;truck with her Beau|ty, but the Elegance of her Conver&s;ation, firmly fixed every tender Thought.&mdash;<HI>Con|yers</HI> perceived his Lord&s;hip's Anxiety, and gue&s;&s;ing the Cau&s;e, hinted his Su&s;picion.&mdash; <Q>True, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> I own my Love, nor am I a&s;hamed of it. An Object &s;o infinitely worthy, mu&s;t engro&s;s my Heart. Dear <HI>Conyers,</HI> let me require your Friend|&s;hip. A&s;&s;i&s;t me with the <HI>Colonel</HI> and his <HI>deare&s;t</HI> Daughter, as I a&s;&s;i&s;ted you with <HI>Harriot.</HI> I am certain of my Father's Con&s;ent, and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t of Men.</Q>&mdash;The Captain, who was rejoiced at this Incident, a&s;&s;ured him of his Intere&s;t, and the next Day, not only obtained the Colonel's Con&s;ent, but artfully found out from <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> that my Lord was far from be|ing di&s;agreeable to her.&mdash;<HI>Lord Truegood</HI> was in Raptures, and the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Conyers</HI> curtailed a long Court&s;hip, which of all People, Men of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sincerity</HI> are the lea&s;t capable of doing for them&s;elves. The Way being now paved, the Affair went &s;moothly on, and only wanted <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Lady Mountworth</HI>'s Approbation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> re&s;igned to the <HI>Colonel</HI> the Promi&s;e of his Intere&s;t for a Seat in <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> and begged him to transfer it where, &s;oon, it would be naturally due. When
<PB N="218" REF="221">
his Family Affairs were &s;ettled, they all agreed on a Journey to <HI>London;</HI> and, as the <HI>Colonel</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> were infirm, they were obliged to make ea&s;y Stages. His <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> daily made fre&s;h Di&s;coveries of the Under&s;tanding and good Nature of Mi&s;s <HI>Manly,</HI> and &s;he found her Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction ari&s;e, the more &s;he con|ver&s;ed with him.&mdash;In &s;hort, it is not in Na|ture to give more real Joy, than what this good Company felt.</P>
<P>ON their Arrival in <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Conyers</HI> flew to Lady <HI>Harriot,</HI> and <HI>Lord Truegood</HI> to his Father. One di&s;covered his Soul more openly, and the other mentioned, what Lord <HI>Mountworth</HI> and my Lady were charmed to hear.</P>
<P>MATTERS were in this Situation, when HONOUR attacked the Captain with &s;uch Force, as almo&s;t to unhinge his flattering Hopes. This <HI>bu&s;y Companion</HI> &s;eemed to hint, <HI>That he ought in Ju&s;tice to make him|&s;elf known to my Lord before the Marriage; that it would heighten his Character, and prevent the Imputation of an Impo&s;tor.</HI>&mdash; He owned the Truth of this, but at the &s;ame Time, he looked on his Per&s;on, Ac|compli&s;hments and Fortune, as very far from Counterfeits. His di&s;covering him|&s;elf, gave him no Unea&s;ine&s;s, but he dread|ed,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
that his <HI>Love</HI> might be injured by it; and, as he could by no Means think of putting it to the Hazard, he determined &s;till to be &s;ilent.&mdash;I write the Fact, and will neither approve or condemn this Conduct. The Truth is, <HI>he loved,</HI> and tho&s;e who have felt that Pa&s;&s;ion, perhaps will make Al|lowances for the Faults it occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould I take up the Time of my kind Reader?&mdash;He will naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that Vi&s;its were paid and returned;&mdash;That a Settlement was agreed on;&mdash;That the Lawyers were Fee'd, and all Nece&s;&s;aries done, to the fini&s;hing a Matter of &s;uch Con&s;equence, but without my Help he will not know that <HI>Lady Harriot</HI>'s Fortune was but Ten Thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>Two People, if not <HI>Four,</HI> imagined the Lawyers were very &s;low in their Motions, and the Clerks very dilatory in their Bu&s;i|&s;ine&s;s. A few Guineas enlivened their Pens, and the happy Day, at la&s;t came. The Bi&s;hop of&mdash;joined all their Hands, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Affection of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>LORD MOUNTWWORTH would not too &s;oon di&s;turb the Plea&s;ure of his <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters,</HI> but in &s;ix Weeks, he began to think of returning to <HI>Ireland,</HI> from whence he had been ab&s;ent three Years. As he

found Captain <HI>Conyers</HI> and <HI>Lady Harriot</HI> greatly inclined to go, he advi&s;ed him to keep his Money Matters in &s;uch a Readi|ne&s;s, that he might di&s;po&s;e of it the fir&s;t convenient Opportunity.&mdash;<Q>Whatever, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> &s;ome may imagine, let me advi&s;e you to Purcha&s;e in that <HI>Kingdom,</HI> but in one of tho&s;e Counties the lea&s;t im|proved.

<PB N="221" REF="224">
was too &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Truths, not to a|gree with my Lord.&mdash;His Spirit was al|ready in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and his Imagination plan|ed out his future Conduct.</P>
<P>COLONEL MANLY grew impatient to re|turn Home, there, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> to re&s;t for ever. <HI>Lady Truegood</HI> could not think of quitting her Father, and the young <HI>Lord</HI> could not part from his deare&s;t Wife, &s;o that the old Gentleman was perfectly happy, when they agreed to accompany him. &mdash;He took a mo&s;t tender Leave of all his Friends; but, embracing <HI>Conyers</HI> with Tears of the true&s;t Affection, call'd him his <HI>Friend,</HI> his <HI>Soldier,</HI>&mdash;but could utter no more than, <HI>Heaven ble&s;s and protect you,</HI> and retir'd with Eyes full of the tender Pa&s;&s;ion, to which <HI>Lady Mountworth</HI> and <HI>Lady Harriot</HI> mo&s;t liberally &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THE Captain took a good Hou&s;e and Garden at <HI>Richmond</HI> for Mrs. <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> who promi&s;ed to be mo&s;t careful of Mrs. <HI>Ma|gragh</HI> when &s;he arrived.

<P>ON their Arrival at <HI>Waterford,</HI> they were inform'd, that the Gentleman they wanted was then at <HI>Clonmell,</HI> and next Morning they pur&s;ued their Journey to that City.

A&s;toni&s;hment at finding him&s;elf actually placed in his <HI>fir&s;t Habitation!</HI>&mdash;He utter'd &s;ome Words that greatly affected his <HI>Lord|&s;hip,</HI> who imagined a Lightne&s;s in the Brain, and made him mo&s;t ardently de&s;ire to be in a Place where proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance could be had.&mdash;In a little Time his Spirits &s;o much revived, that my Lord hurry'd him into the Chai&s;e, and the Beggar had Rea&s;on to be thankful for the Accident.</P>
<P>THE CAPTAIN was lo&s;t in Thought. The Idea of former Times was &s;o &s;trong, and every childi&s;h Circum&s;tance recurr'd &s;o clearly to his Memory, that it might have been fatal to him, had not his Eyes given Vent to the Throbbings of his Heart.&mdash; This la&s;ted a con&s;iderable Time; but he was quite him&s;elf when he arrived at <HI>Clon|mell.</HI></P>

<P>Next Morning, Lord <HI>Mountworth</HI> in the mo&s;t affectionate Manner, embraced <HI>Con|yers,</HI> and call'd him his <HI>Son,</HI>&mdash;his <HI>Friend.</HI>&mdash; <Q>Permit me, <HI>&s;aid the Captain,</HI> to a&s;k your Lord&s;hip, if you can give me any Ac|count of Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI>'s Niece <HI>Nannett?</HI>' &mdash;'To the be&s;t of my Memory, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> &s;he married Mr. <HI>Lilly</HI> the U&s;her, about the Time you left the School.

<P>IN the la&s;t I had the Honour of writing to you, I traced out the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pro|gre&s;s</HI> of WISDOM in your antient Kingdom of IRELAND.&mdash;Permit me, a little, to con|tinue the Subject, and then I &s;hall mention my <HI>Ways</HI> for making their <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> abor|tive.</P>
<P>SOME of their Wi&s;e Heads have found out, that <HI>Ireland</HI> contains about <HI>two Mil|lions</HI> of Inhabitants, and they have likewi&s;e found out, that the <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> of a Nation are in Proportion to their In|habitants <HI>properly employed.</HI>&mdash;Such a Di&s;co|very was infinitely again&s;t the <HI>true Intere&s;t</HI> of our Family.&mdash;On this they built, and then computed the Value to the Government of every <HI>indu&s;trious Individual,</HI> which, I think, they made amount to about <HI>ten Pounds</HI> a Year.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="255">THEY then proceeded by a Thing called Arithmetick.&mdash;<HI>If</HI> ONE <HI>indu&s;trious Subject&mdash; be worth</HI> TEN POUNDS <HI>a Year to the State, &mdash;what will be the Value of</HI> TWO MILLIONS of <HI>&s;uch Subjects?</HI>&mdash;And, &s;uch is the Power of Figures! They made it plain that that Number was really worth TWENTY MIL|LIONS each Year.</P>
<P>IN order to acquire &s;uch <HI>Riches,</HI> the fir&s;t Care of the&s;e <HI>avaritious Gentry</HI> was to poi|&s;on the Minds of their Tenants with No|tions of <HI>Indu&s;try.</HI>&mdash;No ea&s;y Ta&s;k! But as they knew, that the <HI>Popi&s;h Religion,</HI>&mdash;their having &s;uch Swarms of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to maintain,&mdash; their Number of <HI>Holy Days,</HI>&mdash;and their na|tural Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>Sauntering,</HI> were &s;o many Draw-backs to <HI>Wealth, Hone&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>Cleanline&s;s,</HI> it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to change the <HI>Religion</HI> of the People, and make them &s;purn at our <HI>holy In&s;titutions.</HI>&mdash; This cruel Blow has been but too well fol|lowed; &mdash; Their <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> have matched with &s;uch gigantick Strides, that within the&s;e <HI>twenty Years,</HI> the whole Face of the Country is changed.&mdash;Now the Tra|veller journies on <HI>Roads</HI> the fine&s;t in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and repo&s;es him&s;elf, not in <HI>Barns,</HI> or <HI>Hovels,</HI> but in good, <HI>clean,</HI> and <HI>commodious</HI> Hou&s;es.&mdash;He may in Time be entertained with all the Beauties of the Country,

<P>'TIS amazing to ob&s;erve, how the <HI>tri|vial Praemiums</HI> of a little Society in DUBLIN have &s;purred on <HI>greedy Minds.</HI>&mdash;Scarcely has any Branch of <HI>Manufacture,</HI> or <HI>u&s;eful Art,</HI> e&s;caped their Notice and <HI>Encourage|ment.</HI>&mdash;Such low Creatures are they, that they ran&s;ack even the <HI>Dunghills,</HI> and give Praemiums to the old Women, who gather mo&s;t <HI>Rags to make Paper.</HI>&mdash;Should our Schemes oblige the <HI>Rebels</HI> to return to your Obedience, I would except the&s;e <HI>Fellows</HI> out of the general Pardon.</P>
<P>WHAT have we not to fear, &s;hould <HI>In|du&s;try,</HI> like other Novelties, become a <HI>Fa|&s;hion</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI>&mdash;INDUSTRY!

<P><HI>DULLNESS</HI> be prai&s;ed, all Thoughts are now dropt of making <HI>Ireland</HI> a <HI>Corn Country.</HI> I own, I am &s;urpri&s;ed their <HI>Cler|gy</HI> do not attempt it, as it would &s;o much encrea&s;e their <HI>Tythes.</HI> They have talked of <HI>publick Granaries,</HI> but it was meer Talk; nor &s;hall I remind them of it.&mdash;Indeed an Attempt was once made to encourage <HI>Til|lage,</HI> by granting, as in <HI>England,</HI> a <HI>Bounty

<P>WITHOUT Vanity I may &s;ay, I gave the fir&s;t <HI>Hint</HI> of <HI>re&s;training Ireland,</HI> with Re|gard to WOOLL, and then, I <HI>dexterou&s;ly con|trived,</HI> that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might <HI>&s;muggle</HI> it as well as <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> The happy Con&s;equence is, that <HI>Thou&s;ands of the</HI> French <HI>are amu&s;ed in manufacturing of it, whil&s;t as many of your Rebel Subjects are &s;tarving at Home.</HI>&mdash;To my great Joy, this cannot <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> be al|ter'd; for &s;o long as the <HI>Iri&s;h love Mutton,</HI> and feed <HI>Millions of Sheep;</HI> and &s;o long as they have <HI>more Wooll,</HI> than their <HI>home Con|&s;umption requires,</HI> &s;o long will they <HI>act</HI> on the Principles of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and &s;ell it to the <HI>be&s;t Bidder.</HI>&mdash;Perhaps your <HI>Fooli&s;h|ne&s;s</HI> will be &s;urprized, that &s;o large a King|dom as <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould want <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h Wooll:</HI> But&mdash;let me wi&s;per in your Ear.&mdash;<HI>All their Wooll cannot make one Piece of Serge.</HI>&mdash;Why this is &s;o, LEEDS, and every Cloathing Town in <HI>England</HI> can bet|ter explain than I.&mdash;Should they ever at|tempt a <HI>Change</HI> in this Matter, let us get a

<HI>Burrough</HI> or two to <HI>petition</HI> again&s;t it, and order your Brother CLAMOUR to attend.&mdash; They are truly, <HI>in this Re&s;pect,</HI> in <HI>the Way</HI> we wi&s;h them in; nor do I believe they will alter, till they are convinced, <HI>That it is more eligible to encourage the Subjects of</HI> Ire|land <HI>in &s;ome certain Branches of Trade, than by a contrary Conduct, drive tho&s;e Branches into the Arms of the common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>general Rule,</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful is, <HI>eternally</HI> to play <HI>one Part</HI> of the <HI>Mo|narchy</HI> again&s;t the <HI>other,</HI> and con&s;tantly to keep up <HI>that noble Spirit</HI> of <HI>Grumbling,</HI> and <HI>turning</HI> every Act of their <HI>Government</HI> into <HI>Ridicule.</HI> What MACHIAVEL &s;ays of a <HI>Prince,</HI> may well be applied to GREAT-BRITAIN and <HI>Ireland.</HI> <Q>They ought a|bove all things carefully to avoid render|ing them&s;elves odious or de&s;picable; for &s;uch a Conduct protects them from eve|ry Danger.</Q>&mdash;Could we contrive, not only to make them odious and de&s;pi|cable in the Eyes of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> but likewi&s;e to each other, how happy &s;hould we be!</P>
