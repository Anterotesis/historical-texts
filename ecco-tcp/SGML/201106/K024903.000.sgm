<HEAD>A NEW ESSAY ON THE SMALL-POX.</HEAD>
<P>_EVery Per&s;on is &s;en&s;ible, how fatal the Di&s;ea&s;e I in&s;i&s;t on, hath been the&s;e late Years; and perhaps there is not a Family in the Kingdom, that laments not the Spoils of it; which is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify every hone&s;t At|tempt, to free the Publick from &s;uch a Ca|lamity.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>I &s;hall not enter into the Di&s;pute about Ino|culation, which is now on the Carpet; by rea&s;on what I have in my Views, is the &s;u|per&s;eding any Occa&s;ion for that Operation; which, if it could be obtain'd, mu&s;t, on ma|ny Accounts, be preferr'd to the general Pra|ctice of it; and render it more &s;afe in the few In&s;tances, wherein, after all, it may be e&s;teem'd proper.</P>
<P>In order to introduce this Propo&s;al, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve what gave me the fir&s;t Hint, and is the real Foundation of it; <HI>viz. That the Di&s;temper it &s;elf is both of a Fo|reign Extract, and of a late Origin.</HI> There are &s;ome Parts of the World entirely unac|quainted with it at this Day; and we are a&s;&s;ur'd, one Quarter of it (viz. <HI>America</HI>) was &s;o, till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ubdued it; when, by the Infection of a Negro, this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread it &s;elf among the Natives, and hath now almo&s;t extirpated great and populous Clans.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Phy&s;icians had no Idea of this Di&s;order; For we have the
<PB N="3" REF="5">fir&s;t De&s;criptions of it from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Wri|ters. I confe&s;s, we read of Eruptions in Fe|vers; and have Rea&s;on to think the&s;e obtain'd in ancient Time. I know not whether what we term the <HI>Chicken-Pox,</HI> may not be a pro|per critical Secretion of &s;ome Humours in Children; for they often affect them, with|out any previous Contagion, and are attend|ed with no ill Con&s;equence. But the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabs</HI> (who, every Per&s;on knows, by their &s;ordid, na&s;ty way of Living, in a hot Climate, have turn'd common Fevers into Plagues;) have perhaps, in the &s;ame man|ner, given that malignant, contagious Effi|cacy, to tho&s;e Mild and Natural Pu|&s;tules.</P>
<P>From this Account of the Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t evidently follow, that the Di&s;temper I now treat of, <HI>is One Species of a Plague;</HI> and therefore both <HI>may,</HI> and <HI>ought,</HI> in the &s;ame Manner, to be extirpated from the Na|tion.</P>
<P>The late Experiments of Inoculating it, confirm this Account; and, at the &s;ame Time, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate, how &s;mall a Seed,
<PB N="4" REF="6">le&s;s than the Hundredth Part of a Grain, will produce a very plentiful Crop. It's true, this may differ very much, in regard of the Soil; which is a Con&s;ideration, in Favour of a Practice, that allows us a con|venient Opportunity to prepare the Body, and to adju&s;t both the Quantity and Situation of the Particles, that are thrown into it. But why &s;hou'd we <HI>generally</HI> cultivate after this manner an <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Plant, that hath made &s;uch dreadful Havock among us? E&s;pecially &s;ince there is &s;o much Rea&s;on to que&s;tion, whether we could promi&s;e our &s;elves that Succe&s;s, if it were <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> in U&s;e: For, the Contagion mu&s;t increa&s;e in Proportion to the Subjects; whereas, on the other hand, when the Di&s;ea&s;e hath left us, the few who (on the Account of Travelling, or Phy&s;ick) may have leave to go through the Opera|tion, will run le&s;s Hazard in it.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, there will be a Difficulty in o|vercoming popular Prejudices, in Favour of the&s;e Di&s;orders. They e&s;teem them &s;ent of God, for the Sins of Mankind; which is a pious Account of all our Afflictions. But when this Repre&s;entation di&s;courages the pro|per
<PB N="5" REF="7">Endeavours to remove them; it hath ge|nerally been e&s;teem'd, in other Ca&s;es, a cri|minal Abu&s;e of the Doctrine. This is per|fectly the Ca&s;e in <HI>Turkey;</HI> where, for that Rea&s;on, their great Towns are no more free from the Plague, than ours are from the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> But I have the Plea&s;ure to ob|&s;erve, that <HI>the Articles of the Church of England</HI> prudently caution us again&s;t this Con&s;truction of the Sentence of Prede&s;tina|nation; <HI>which, for Curious and Carnal Per|&s;ons to have before their Eyes,</HI> is there &s;aid to be, <HI>a great Downfall.</HI> But I leave the Management of this Argument to our Di|vines.</P>
<P>When our People are well reconcil'd to the Religion of the Thing, there can, perhaps, be nothing more ea&s;y or &s;afe, than to deliver us from the Infection. For, the Sub&s;tance of my Propo&s;al is but, in &s;hort,
<Q>To take the Method, that was in&s;i&s;ted on as nece&s;&s;ary to deliver us from the Plague, if it had been imported among us; <HI>as we appre|hended it might, from</HI> Mar&s;eilles.</Q></P>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<P>The Thing is then &s;o far done, that I have Rea&s;on to hope, and &s;ay, A few Generations hence would enquire, what Sort of Di&s;temper their Ance&s;tors intended, by the Name of the <HI>Small-Pox?</HI> And when &s;o great an Advantage may be procur'd by it; there can be nothing unkind, or difficult, only <HI>in obliging the At|tendants and Phy&s;icians, where the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>are, to perform a Sort of</HI> Quarantain; <HI>to bury the Furniture, and purify the Hou&s;es;</HI> which is all that will be requir'd, and to which they will have &s;ufficient Inducement to con&s;ent, if the Lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain by it, is but &s;upported by the Publick. I know not whether an <HI>Office of In&s;urance</HI> might not be e&s;tabli&s;h'd for that Purpo&s;e: But this will be the Care of the Legi&s;lature, if our Phy&s;icians do but come in|to the Scheme: They are the only Per&s;ons that will &s;uffer, in a profitable Branch of their Practice. But whatever &s;ome impudent Quacks may have in their View, I have the A&s;&s;urance to &s;ay, The Gentlemen of the Faculty, up|on the Principles of the New Philo&s;ophy, and the be&s;t Experience, will e&s;teem this Propo|&s;al worthy their Con&s;ideration. They know very well, that when the Eruption is com|pleated,
<PB N="7" REF="9">and the putrid Particles have fix'd on the Lungs, and vital Parts, the Event mu&s;t be left to Nature; for there is little Room for the Exerci&s;e of the be&s;t Skill: And upon that Account, they mu&s;t be pleas'd with an Expedient, that will &s;ecure their Art from the Tryals, that are vain in them&s;elves, and often fatal to their Reputation. As for the Scandal of our Profe&s;&s;ion, the Men who have no Comfort but in Filth and Ordure, and are only Caterers for the Worms; I am not a|&s;ham'd to confe&s;s, I have &s;hew'd no regard to their mercenary Ends.</P>
<P>It is to the very Learned and Worthy-Bo|dy, I &s;ubmit this Propo&s;al; who will, I am per&s;uaded, at lea&s;t honourably treat a Plan, that is form'd upon the Practice of &s;ome of the Ancient Phy&s;icians, the Fathers and fir&s;t Ornaments of this Science; who did not on|ly con&s;ult particular Ca&s;es, but <HI>deliver'd whole Nations at once from Plagues.</HI> If the Method I have &s;ugge&s;ted appears to them as well cal|culated for this Purpo&s;e, as it's hone&s;tly de|&s;ign'd; I have no Rea&s;on to doubt the Appro|bation of Per&s;ons of &s;uch a generous and gen|teel
<PB N="8" REF="10">Education, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is the Health of the People.</P>
<P>I know, the Fate of this Scheme will de|pend on their Repre&s;entation of it; and there|fore, by rea&s;on <HI>The Royal College of Phy&s;icians</HI> are be&s;t qualify'd to direct the Execution, I have not pre&s;um'd to offer the <HI>particular Rules</HI> that mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, and that will require the Sanction of the Legi&s;lature: It is what, I do not doubt, they will favour their Coun|try with, if this Propo&s;al is &s;o happy as to come recommended by them.</P>
<P><HI>His Mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty,</HI> whom God long pre&s;erve; and Their <HI>Royal Highne&s;&s;es,</HI> tho' they are now in no pain for the <HI>Princes,</HI> the young Hopes and Joys of the&s;e Realms; They have too much Regard for their People, not to encourage every Thing that may make them Happy and Healthful.</P>
<P>And I hope our <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Gentry</HI> will e&s;teem it too much a common Intere&s;t, to neglect this Propo&s;al, if there is a Pro&s;pect (as, I think, there is a very good one) in this Way of being &s;ecure from this Di&s;temper,
<PB N="9" REF="11">and, at the &s;ame Time, from a Train of E|vils and Ulcers, that generally attend the wor&s;t Sort of it. For why &s;hou'd we cheri&s;h the cruel Brood of <HI>Africa</HI> or <HI>A&s;ia</HI> in our Bow|els, that have made tho&s;e frightful Ravages a|mong us, and entail this Poi&s;on on our Po&s;te|rity, that was, perhaps, the Import of our Holy Wars in former Days?</P>
<P>How great mu&s;t be the Happine&s;s to ob|&s;erve the new Scenes ari&s;e, when a noi&s;ome Plague &s;hall cea&s;e to <HI>change our Countenances, and &s;end us away, or to make us a Terror to our &s;elves and others!</HI> How de&s;irable would it be, no more (unle&s;s by the &s;pecial Commi&s;|&s;ion of Heaven) to feel any of the Fury of it, filling our Graves, or &s;poiling our Fea|tures? We &s;hou'd not then &s;o frequently meet the di&s;mal Scars, and indelible Characters, it hath left on almo&s;t every Face: But <HI>Britain,</HI> no longer inhabited by the&s;e Sort of <HI>Picts,</HI> would become <HI>Fair Albion</HI> once again.</P>
<P>Then, to u&s;e the &s;acred Stile, <HI>may our Sons be as Plants grown up in their Youth;</HI> they will always carry their fir&s;t Bloom; <HI>and our Daugh|ters as Corner-&s;tones, poli&s;h'd after the &s;imilitude
<PB N="10" REF="12">of a Palace;</HI> or, in our Language, more &s;mooth and &s;parkling than the be&s;t-wrought Marble. Then would all the Dome&s;tick Virtues flou|ri&s;h: The Beautiful Mothers, &s;ecure of the Affection of their Hu&s;bands, wou'd convey the healthy Trea&s;ure to their Offspring: The La|dies wou'd &s;hine in our A&s;&s;emblies; and the Gentlemen &s;often, under their Influence, into every Virtue. Let future Ages tell the re&s;t with Joy!</P>
<P>Full of this Project, I can't forbear ima|ging to my &s;elf the Acknowledgments of a whole I&s;land; and every Per&s;on in it, contri|buting to make my Life ea&s;y and happy, who have in this Propo&s;al &s;tudied to make theirs &s;o.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I wrote this Scheme, I was ve|ry &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome con&s;iderable Ob|jections, which a Learned Gentleman, who is a Glory to the Profe&s;&s;ion, did me the Ho|nour to make to it: As, <HI>That the Seeds of the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>are almo&s;t in every Hou&s;e, which hath made it the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Country.</HI> But how much &s;oever they are naturaliz'd to the Soil, and have diffus'd them&s;elves in it; I have Rea&s;on to hope, Care and Indu&s;try might &s;urmount this Difficulty. For, the Particles appear, by their &s;low Operation, not to have that Life and Action, which tho&s;e have which con&s;titute the Plague: If every Hou&s;e, there|fore, in <HI>Great Britain</HI> (that is &s;u&s;pected) would but &s;ubmit to <HI>&s;uch a Purification</HI> as the <HI>In&s;pir'd Lawgiver</HI> (I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI>) pre|&s;crib'd in another Species of a Plague, <HI>Le|vit.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="14">xiii. 47, 48, &amp;c. and xiv. 33, &amp;c. we might ob&s;erve the happy Effects of it, not only in de&s;troying the Vegetation of the Seeds of this Di&s;temper, but of &s;ome others, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Rags and Dirt. In general, it mu&s;t render the Nation more clean and healthful: And why &s;hould not a <HI>Divine Law,</HI> as far as it re|lates <HI>immediately to Health,</HI> lay us under a Moral Obligation now, where there is any Parity in the Ca&s;e, as I apprehend in the pre|&s;ent? Our Criticks may ob&s;erve with Plea|&s;ure, the <HI>Arabian</HI> Phy&s;icians apply to the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> &s;ome of the Terms which occur in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Ver&s;ion of the&s;e Chapters. If it is &s;aid, The Prie&s;ts were to execute the Sa|cred Order; it is, becau&s;e <HI>They</HI> were the An|cient <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI> But it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to con&s;ider the typical U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I apprehend it will be urged, That after all this Care, when they are extirpated in one Place, they may po&s;&s;ibly break out in another. It is what may be expected for &s;ome Time, and will only require a more con&s;tant Attendance on this Di&s;temper through the whole I&s;land: In which this Advantage will probably be gain'd; That whenever it does
<PB N="13" REF="15">&s;prout in any Quarter, there will be the great|e&s;t Rea&s;on to expect, where the Soil is not too favourable, (if I may be allow'd to pur&s;ue a Figure that will be&s;t explain it to the com|mon Reader) it will be a weak and tender Shoot, which we may ea&s;ily weed out, and not one rank Crop upon another, as we &s;ome|times experience now.</P>
<P>As for the Time that will be requir'd to ac|compli&s;h all this; it can't be &s;uppos'd I &s;hou'd pre&s;ume to determine it: For, our Phy&s;icians know, it was &s;everal Years before we were rid of the la&s;t Plague. It is &s;ufficient, that the Affair is of &s;o much Con&s;equence, that the Children who are yet unborn demand our Attention to it.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Objection is from the Preju|dices of the People; who are inclin'd to think every Abridgment of their Liberty, tho' it is for their Advantage, inhuman and bar|barous. But in this In&s;tance, I know not how it is; Per&s;ons of Quality and Fortune, and very many of the Populace, are almo&s;t come into this Practice of them&s;elves, from their own Ob&s;ervations and Rea&s;onings upon the
<PB N="14" REF="16">Head. The Husband and Wife, we have &s;een content to live apart for a Time; or, if they are determin'd again&s;t it, they might perhaps be indulg'd to perform the <HI>Quarantain</HI> toge|ther.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews,</HI> as &s;tiff-neck'd and rebellious a People as they are repre&s;ented in the Holy Writings, had &s;o much regard to their Health, as to &s;ubmit to a much &s;everer <HI>Regimen.</HI> For there is a va&s;t Difference between a Separa|tion from Society for a few Days, which is all this Scheme requires; and theirs, which in &s;ome Ca&s;es continued for Life.</P>
<P>I can't doubt, the Worthy and Learned Col|lege of Phy&s;icians, if they came into the Pro|po&s;al, wou'd take care to direct the Execution of it, to a general Satisfaction: And upon this Account, if the Legi&s;lature made them a Sort of <HI>Office of In&s;urance;</HI> the Contributions they would receive from the whole Nation, and the Voluntary Benefactions of very many, to who&s;e Families this Di&s;temper hath been fa|tal, would, I'm per&s;uaded, render them very capable of di&s;charging that Service, by their Agents, with great Applau&s;e. I might &s;ug|ge&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="17">the Plea&s;ure they mu&s;t have by that Cor|re&s;pondence this would e&s;tabli&s;h, to ob&s;erve the State of Di&s;ea&s;es and Phy&s;ick through the whole Nation, and to direct the Practice of it in this In&s;tance: Which la&s;t is a Con&s;i|deration of too much Weight, not to be of|fer'd to the Publick: For, if any Thing can, it mu&s;t reconcile every Per&s;on to this Propo|&s;al; That He, and his Relations, tho' they are the meane&s;t of the People, (among whom this Di&s;temper generally lodges) will have proper Medicines and Attendance, and be|come the Care of the mo&s;t Learned Body of Phy&s;icians in the World.</P>
