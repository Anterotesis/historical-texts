<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the Year 1769, the Au|thor of the following Tract, being frequently Witne&s;s to the Mi&s;e|ries
<PB N="4" REF="3">attending People that had the Mis|fortune to be burned or &s;calded, was in|duced to apply him&s;elf &s;tudiou&s;ly to ob&s;erve the Effects, and to find a Re|medy that would quickly re&s;tore Na|ture, and one &s;o &s;imple, that it might in general be readily adopted in all Fa|milies. &mdash;This De&s;ideratum was ac|cordingly, after many Experiments about that Time, acquired, and Num|bers that have been mi&s;erably &s;corched and &s;calded have been in&s;tantaneou&s;ly cured by following the Author's Me|thod.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>THE outer Dre&s;s of Ladies being of late Years compo&s;ed of Gauze, Mu&s;lin, and other inflammable Articles, which blaze away &s;o violently, when they un|fortunately take Fire, that the mo&s;t dreadful Mi&s;chief has en&s;ued, too &s;ud|denly for Prevention. The Numbers of the Unfortunate have much increa&s;ed with the Fa&s;hion;&mdash;how many have of late been mo&s;t mi&s;erably &s;corched and defaced;&mdash;how many have &s;uffered a lingering death, under the mo&s;t ex|cruciating tortures;&mdash;while the Me|thods u&s;ed as Remedies have only
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;erved to lengthen the Term of their Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE Author pre&s;umes, that the Uti|lity of his Method will entitle it to a favourable Reception with the Public, and that there need no Apology for the Publication.</P>
<P>IN the U&s;e of Oil, and &s;everal other Things that are applied as Remedies for Scalds and Burns, it may be ob&s;erved, that Nature denies their Admi&s;&s;ion into the Pores of the Skin. That the acid Per&s;pira|tion,
<PB N="7" REF="6">Plenty of which is generally upon the Surface of the Skin, together with the continued Action of Nature through the Pores, are Repellers of &s;everal Things that would be Remedies in the&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Author &s;urmi&s;ed, that if this acid Per&s;piration was to be overcome, or continually wa&s;hed away as it is produced, that Applications might then take Effect; and in Con&s;equence of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations, after repeated Experiments, he laid down the follow|ing
<PB N="8" REF="7">ea&s;y Rules, which, when practi&s;ed, were never known to fail, but many and &s;urpri&s;ing Cures have been per|formed; and &s;o far from giving Pain, that the Pain cau&s;ed by the Burning or Scalding cea&s;es immediately on the Application. Whereas &s;uch violent Pains are produced by the Application of Spirits, and &s;ome other Things, that the Remedy is wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Patient lingers out a mo&s;t mi|&s;erable Life, and dies the mo&s;t excru|ciating of all Deaths.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>TAKE Soft Soap (Hard if that is not to be had), di&s;&s;olve it in boiling Water, exceeding &s;trong, in as little Water as po&s;&s;ible; then make it cold immediately, by the Addition of cold Water; be careful to ob&s;erve, that there be full &s;ix Ounces of Soap in every Gallon of this cold Solution, and Half a Drachm of Sal Tartar:&mdash; Then put in the injured Part, and move it gently about, keeping it there Half an Hour: For a recent Matter this is &s;ufficient; if it be of long Standing it may be continued or repeated as Oc|ca&s;ion requires.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>MIND to have Solution in Proportion to the Nature of the Ca&s;e. If a Per|&s;on is &s;calded or &s;corched all over, he or &s;he may &s;tand or &s;it up to the Chin naked in it, and frequently immerge the Head, or let &s;ome Per&s;on continu|ally pour plentifully of the Solution upon the Head.</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e, it will take 50 or 60 Gallons of Water, and from 18 lb. to 22 lb. of Soap, with about two Ounces of Sal Tartar.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P>THIS will be &s;trong enough to take off all Grea&s;ine&s;s and Dirt from the Body, without rubbing. It will keep the injured Part &s;oft and cold, while the Circulation regains its u&s;ual or a new Cour&s;e, and innate Nature repairs the Havoc made by the Fire.</P>
<P>A FEW Ca&s;es, among many, here follow, by Way of Elucidation:</P>
<P>A BOY having his Leg &s;calded, by a Pan-full of boiling Water being thrown upon it, after trying various Methods
<PB N="12" REF="11">for three or four Days to no Purpo&s;e, was cured by keeping it in the Solution (prepared as abovementioned) about Half an Hour, &s;o that the Pain never returned, and the Leg healed in a very &s;hort Time.</P>
<P>IN like Manner, a Man was cured who burned the Skin off his Hand, and terribly &s;corched the Fle&s;h, again&s;t a hot Plate of Iron.</P>
<P>THE Author having accidentally &s;lipped his Arm, almo&s;t up to the
<PB N="13" REF="12">Elbow, into a Copper of Water that was boiling furiou&s;ly; he put it into cold Water, which immediately took off the Pain, which was become exce&s;|&s;ive; while immer&s;ed, it was be|numbed and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, but when took out of the Water, the Pain returned with great Violence.&mdash;He therefore kept it in this Situation while the So|lution was making as above.&mdash;The Soap being di&s;&s;olved and cooled well, he plunged his Hand and Arm in it; the Pain never returned, the Numb|ne&s;s went off, and the Limb as it were
<PB N="14" REF="13">revivified; he continued it in the above Solution about 15 Minutes, and never after felt the lea&s;t Pain or ill Effects from this terrible Scald.</P>
