<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE RETROVERSION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e which is the &s;ubject of the following &s;heets, is neither generally known, nor hath it been fully treated of by any author I have read; which &s;eems rather remarkable in this enlightened age, when the indu&s;try and abilities of many of the faculty &s;hine forth &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly, e&s;pecially as the di&s;order is dan|gerous, and often proves fatal. There are indeed &s;ome ca&s;es in print,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries, Vol. IV. and V.</NOTE> which authenticate the di&s;ea&s;e, and partially de&s;cribe its &s;ymptoms; but, in my humble opinion, no remedy hath hitherto been di&s;clo&s;ed which perfectly meets the evil, or is adequate to the removal of it.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<P>DR. HUNTER, in his remarks on the retroverted uterus, a&s;&s;erts, that the very exi&s;tence of &s;uch a ca&s;e has been controverted. But, having my&s;elf met with a con&s;iderable number, in the cour&s;e of thirty years practice, I am induced to believe, that this dreadful malady occurs more frequently than the faculty in ge|neral &s;uppo&s;es. Nor do I apprehend that many of our practitioners, in the remote parts of the country at lea&s;t, &s;u&s;pect it to happen till it is too late to admini&s;ter relief; for the di&s;order, if long neglected, will mo&s;t probably terminate fatally, as too clearly appears by the &s;econd ca&s;e hereafter to be related; and the event will be the &s;ame if it &s;hould chance to be mi&s;taken. Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when I was a &s;tudent under the late cele|brated anatomi&s;t abovementined, in the year one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four, a ca&s;e of this &s;ort occurred to him; and the Doctor, in a lecture extra|ordinary, which he gave to the faculty, with the parts before him, treated it as a new ca&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ca&s;e has been communicated to the public.</NOTE> without a&s;&s;igning any &s;atisfactory cau&s;e, or pointing out any competent
<PB N="3" REF="7">remedy. The opinion he formed of it afterwards may be &s;een in his remarks;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries. Vol. V. Page 388.</NOTE> which, however, were un|known to me when I hit upon my method of cure; and I mu&s;t add, that &s;ince the year 1754, I have never heard &s;uch a ca&s;e mentioned in conver&s;ation by any of the faculty, except once, by Mr. Hey of Leeds, a gentleman in exten&s;ive practice, who is a very accurate ob&s;erver, and an ornament to his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I have made no &s;ecret of the facts I have met with; but, on proper occa&s;ions, made known to &s;ome of the faculty all tho&s;e ca&s;es which have fallen immediately under my own care, together with my ob|&s;ervations upon them: and as I have been the happy in|&s;trument, under Providence, of relieving many afflicted per&s;ons in this complaint, I thought it a duty incumbent on me to communicate to the public that method of cure which I have found effectual; hoping that it will be of &s;ervice to young practitioners in midwifery, and po&s;&s;ibly not unacceptable to tho&s;e of longer experience.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<P>PERHAPS I may not be able to make my&s;elf clearly under&s;tood in the de&s;criptive part, but &s;hall endeavour to &s;urmount that difficulty as well as I can, and &s;hall hone&s;tly propo&s;e the remedies which I believe to be effectual.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, I &s;hall give the general &s;ymp|toms of the di&s;order, from the time when they become &s;pecific and unequivocal, till the happy or fatal termina|tion, together with an anatomical explanation of the uterus, in its retroverted &s;tate, when the di&s;order has taken place.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS I &s;hall &s;ubmit to the reader what I take to be the proper treatment of the di&s;order; and will farther venture to add my ideas as to the cau&s;e of it, grounded upon a number of ca&s;es which have fallen under my own immediate ob&s;ervation; and will take occa&s;ion to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;covering the di&s;order in as early a &s;tage as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="9">
<P>I WOULD fir&s;t generally ob&s;erve that all the patients labouring under this complaint, whom I have been called to a&s;&s;i&s;t, were of relaxed habits of body, and that every one of them, when advanced into the third month of pregnancy, began to complain of making water with dif|ficulty, which before that time they had not properly at|tended to, generally attributing this complaint to their having been interrupted in the doing of it, or otherwi&s;e di&s;appointed of obeying the fir&s;t calls of nature.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty of making water, when the uterus is inverted, daily increa&s;es, and is attended with a dull pain about the &s;ymphy&s;is of the o&s;&s;a pubis, until nearly a to|tal &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine takes place.</P>
<P>FROM that time the pain about the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis becomes more and more acute. To the&s;e &s;ymp|toms &s;ucceeds a great difficulty in going to &s;tool, with a bearing down pain through the whole pelvis; every one of
<PB N="6" REF="10">which evils continue to increa&s;e, and at la&s;t no feces can be got rid of without the aid of cly&s;ters.</P>
<P>BY the time the patient has advanced to the latter end of the third, or beginning of the fourth month of preg|nancy, a&s;&s;i&s;tance is generally called for. But &s;hould the di&s;order continue many days longer undi&s;covered, the danger increa&s;es &s;o as in a &s;hort time to make the cure ex|ceedingly difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible; and then the mo&s;t pro|bable means of &s;aving the life of the patient in this &s;tage of the di&s;order, in my opinion, are tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted in my remarks on the &s;econd ca&s;e, and which I believe will be found generally practicable, and, for the mo&s;t part, at|tended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>HAVING been informed of all &s;ymptoms the patient can de&s;cribe, if they corre&s;pond to tho&s;e mentioned in the 5th page, and the beginning of this, a very probable conjecture may be formed of the ca&s;e, which to a&s;certain more clearly, the following mode of examination may be tried.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="11">
<P>LET the patient lie down on one &s;ide, with her back to you, and her knees drawn up towards the abdomen. Whil&s;t &s;he is in this po&s;ition, the os externum mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed with the fore finger; and the lower part of the vagina, towards the os coccygis, will be found greatly di&s;tended, and upon the &s;tretch from &s;ide to &s;ide, &s;o as to prevent it from collap&s;ing upon the finger. This is occa&s;ioned by a tumor pre&s;enting it&s;elf at the lower part of the os &s;acrum, which totally impedes the finger in its pa&s;&s;age to the hollow of the &s;ame bone, where you might expect to find the os internum; but by pa&s;&s;ing the finger up to the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis, there the collum utere will be di&s;covered, greatly &s;hortened of its natural length, and clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the upper part of the pubis, into the form of a round button, of the thickne&s;s of about half an inch, the os internum opening but little.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in this &s;tate, the &s;hape and form of the col|lum uteri cannot be better de&s;cribed than by comparing it
<PB N="8" REF="12">with a mu&s;hroom ju&s;t beginning to open, the concave &s;ide thereof being towards the pubis.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS, by pa&s;&s;ing the finger up the rectum, you find the tumor, betwixt the rectum and vagina, which is the fundus uteri inverted downwards, and fallen into that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THESE particulars being a&s;certained, a per&s;on is then perfectly ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject; and by carefully attend|ing to, and &s;teadily pur&s;uing the following general direc|tions, there will be little doubt of a cure, by replacing the uterus in it's natural &s;ituation.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this de&s;irable end, I recommend the following method, which I never found inadequate, ex|cept in the de&s;perate in&s;tance which is recorded in the &s;econd ca&s;e, and where it would have been ab&s;urd to make the attempt.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="13">
<P>THE catheter mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed, and all the water drawn off; which is not attended with much difficulty. It will be afterwards proper that a cly&s;ter be admini&s;tered, in order to free the rectum entirely of feces. But in doing of this mo&s;t commonly greater oppo&s;ition is met with than was expected, by rea&s;on of the fundus uteri pre&s;&s;ing the rec|tum clo&s;e to the os &s;acrum:&mdash;the&s;e impediments, how|ever, being removed, the patient &s;hould have &s;ome pro|per cordial to &s;upport her, and al&s;o a little time to recover the fatigue which &s;he has nece&s;&s;arily undergone.</P>
<P>I COME now to the operation it&s;elf. Place three or four pillows upon the floor by the bed&s;ide, upon which the patient mu&s;t re&s;t her head and arms; at the &s;ame time, let her be well &s;upported by two or three female friends, re&s;ting her knees upon the edge of the bed, which &s;hould not be a high one. The operator mu&s;t then be placed upon the bed, behind the patient, taking care not to &s;uf|fer the lea&s;t expo&s;ure, and gradually dilate the os exter|num, until the hand can be pa&s;&s;ed into the vagina; which
<PB N="10" REF="14">done, let him bend the thumb into the palm of the hand, re&s;ting its point ju&s;t betwixt the roots of the little and third finger; then clo&s;e all his fingers upon the thumb, which brings the hand into the &s;malle&s;t compa&s;s po&s;&s;ible; and in this po&s;ition great power and &s;tability will be given to the three fir&s;t fingers, with which every effort mu&s;t be made, by oppo&s;ing the knuckles and middle parts of the&s;e fingers to the tumor or fundus uteri, and as near to the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis as may be, keeping in mind an exact idea of the &s;ituation of the upper part of the &s;a|crum; and towards that part directing his whole pre&s;&s;ure, which mu&s;t be con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>BY per&s;evering in this mode, the os internum is &s;ome|what drawn, by the vagina, towards its natural &s;ituation, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the reduction. If the fir&s;t efforts prove abortive, the attempt mu&s;t be repeated and iterated, till the tumor is found to recede; which mu&s;t be followed up, till the fundus uteri turns over; when it will appear that it has regained its proper and natural &s;ituation. For
<PB N="11" REF="15">it will be immediately di&s;covered, that the os internum is moved from the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis to the hollow of the &s;acrum.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked what force is nece&s;&s;ary to apply in reduc|ing the uterus, &s;o wedged in the pelvis, I know of no better mode to an&s;wer than by referring to a ca&s;e in mid|wifery, where the foetus mu&s;t be turned, when the mem|branes are broke, the liquor amnii is di&s;charged, and the uterus contracted. All who practice in the ob&s;tetric art mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the great power required to effect this; &s;o much force I have found to be nece&s;&s;ary in re|ducing the inverted gravid uterus.</P>
<P>AFTER the operation the patient mu&s;t be put to bed, and take an opiate, and &s;hould continue eight or ten days without being moved therefrom. During this time &s;he mu&s;t be &s;upported with light nouri&s;hing diet, and avoid all force either in making water or going to &s;tool.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="16">
<P>AT the expiration of this period, if no mi&s;carriage hap|pen, upon examining the parts, not only the os inter|num will be found in its proper &s;ituation, but the collum uteri re&s;tored to its natural form; and at the &s;ame time, as the uterus and foetus will have acquired a con&s;iderable bulk, &s;o as to re&s;t upon the brim of the pelvis, there can be little danger of a relap&s;e; at lea&s;t I never experienced any.</P>
<P>AS the late Dr. Hunter, in the Lecture which I have mentioned in the beginning of this paper, did not give any opinion re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of the di&s;order; and as I have not at any time &s;ince, either heard or read of it's being accouted for by any one, what follows upon the &s;ubject I &s;ubmit with the greate&s;t deference, as the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation and experience; hoping that it will at lea&s;t induce others, who are more competent and have better opportunity, more fully to inve&s;tigate this &s;ubject, which I could wi&s;h, for the good of &s;ociety to be perfectly well under&s;tood.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="17">
<P>IT has been before ob&s;erved that all tho&s;e who have been afflicted by this di&s;order, at lea&s;t all whom I have &s;een, were of relaxed habits of body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have an ob&s;ervation to add, that &s;eems to confirm this idea of the di&s;order being peculiar to relaxed habits; namely, that &s;everal of the patients whom I have attended and cured of this complaint, in &s;ome time after have died of drop|&s;ies.</NOTE>: and that, when ad|vanced in their third month of pregnancy, they have ex|perienced a difficulty in making water; to which at fir&s;t they paid little or no attention, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been either natural in their then condition, or occa&s;ioned by not having obeyed the calls of nature; thus contenting them&s;elves, until the increa&s;ing difficulty, terminating in a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, obliges them to &s;end for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will be allowed me, that in all &s;uch ha|bits, every part of the body is equally &s;ubject in a certain degree to the con&s;equences of relaxation; which granted, it &s;eems not unrea&s;onable to imagine that the ligaments of the uterus, &s;o circum&s;tanced, mu&s;t be in a more flaccid
<PB N="14" REF="18">&s;tate than is natural in a robu&s;t habit of body; and con|&s;equently, the uterus is more loo&s;ely &s;u&s;pended in the pelvis, and extremely liable to motion from any preter|natural pre&s;&s;ure or impul&s;e. In &s;uch a &s;ituation then, if there be either a difficulty in making water or a &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of urine, no matter by what cau&s;e occa&s;ioned, the bladder will be preternaturally di&s;tended, and pre&s;&s;ing in every direction, as it ri&s;es in the pelvis, and above the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis, the ligaments of the uterus mu&s;t give way, and the fundus uteri is thereby forced to re|cede. But we find by experience, in every ca&s;e of dif|ficulty in making water, that the bladder &s;carce ever has the power of di&s;charging the whole of it's contents with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And in all &s;uch ca&s;es, that difficulty, not being at fir&s;t &s;ufficiently attended to, hourly increa&s;es, till it ends in a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion: In our ca&s;e, by parity of rea&s;oning, the bladder becomes daily more and more di&s;|&s;tended, and the pre&s;&s;ure again&s;t and over the fundus uteri mu&s;t be continually increa&s;ing, from the &s;ize and weight of the bladder, by the power of which the fundus is forced
<PB N="15" REF="19">back and downwards in the pelvis, between the vagina and rectum, as hath been before de&s;cribed. And when this has once taken place, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the uterus to return to its natural &s;ituation without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To &s;uch can&s;es, how &s;light &s;oever in the begining, do I at|tribute the whole of this dire mi&s;chief: on which ac|count I have always mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommended to pregnant women not to wait after, but rather to antici|pate the calls of nature.</P>
<P>Four ca&s;es, which I have &s;elected out of a con&s;iderable number that fell under my care, are added by way of Appendix to this little E&s;&s;ay; and will, I hope, &s;uffi|ciently confirm the account I have attempted to give of this formidable complaint.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX; CONTAINING FOUR REMARKABLE CASES OF THE GRAVID UTERUS INVERTED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case study">
<HEAD>CASE THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>ON the eighteenth day of Augu&s;t, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-eight, I was &s;ent for to Margaret, the wife of George Sharp, of Knottingley, three miles di&s;tant from Pontefract, in the county of York. She complained of great pain in her body, from a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, which had been increa&s;ing for &s;everal days,
<PB N="18" REF="21">with an odd dull pain at the &s;ymphy&s;is of the os pubis; but &s;he did not &s;uppo&s;e it would lead to any bad con&s;e|quence, believing the whole to have been occa&s;ioned by not making water at a time when &s;he had a pre&s;&s;ing call to it, a few days before the complaint began: &s;he was then about three months gone with child.&mdash;I endeavour|ed to make her &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing the catheter, with which &s;he complied; and, after drawing off two quarts of water, I ordered her &s;ome diuretic medicines, and pre&s;cribed an opiate to be taken at bed|time. I vi&s;ited her again the next day, and found &s;he had enjoyed an ea&s;y night, and had voided more water than for &s;everal days before.&mdash;I then recommended to her to continue the diuretic medicines, to keep her body open, and to take the opiate occa&s;ionally. But on the twenty-&s;eventh I was &s;ent for again, and found her much wor&s;e. She now complained of great pain in the pelvis, and could neither void water nor evacuate any thing by &s;tool;&mdash;I again drew off the very &s;ame quantity of wa|ter as before, and ordered her a cly&s;ter, which an&s;wered
<PB N="19" REF="22">the intention, and gave her great ea&s;e. But imagining that &s;he was about to mi&s;carry, I was de&s;irous to examine her; to this end, having pa&s;&s;ed the os externum with my finger, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that I could by no means proceed in the u&s;ual manner gently up the vagina towards the &s;acrum, in &s;earch of the os internum, being ob&s;tructed by a tumor at the lower extremity of the &s;a|crum, which &s;tretched the vagina from &s;ide to &s;ide. I then pa&s;&s;ed my finger up the rectum, which I perceived was pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to the &s;acrum, by this tumor, &s;ituated betwixt the vagina and rectum; then advancing my fin|ger to the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis, found there the col|lum uteri pre&s;&s;ed into a flat form, &s;omething like a middle &s;ized mu&s;hroom ju&s;t beginning to open. From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and at the &s;ame time recollecting the ca&s;e given by Dr. Hunter, in the year 1754, I was convinced that this tumor could be nothing but the fundus uteri in|verted.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="23">
<P>THIS being the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the kind which had occur|red in my practice, I was led to attempt a reduction of the uterus, in the manner which the Doctor had recom|mended; but, after &s;everal vain attempts, was obliged to leave her, only pre&s;cribing an opiate, till the day fol|lowing.</P>
<P>In the intermediate time, having con&s;idered the ca&s;e in every point of view, as far as I was able, with a female pelvis, and Doctor Smellie's tables before me, the&s;e being the only &s;ources from which I could then derive any in|formation, I determined upon the method of treatment already given at large, which at my next vi&s;it I put in practice. The fir&s;t attempt failed, but I was happy enough to &s;ucceed in a &s;econd effort, and reduced the uterus into its natural &s;ituation. This was done on the twenty-eighth of Augu&s;t, ten days after my fir&s;t &s;eeing the patient.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS &s;he went on in her pregnancy without any further inconvenience, and had a natural and ea&s;y
<PB N="21" REF="24">labour; nor did any evil happen in con&s;equence of the complaint. And &s;everal years after, when I called acci|dentally at the hou&s;e, I found both her and the child in good health.</P>

<P>ON the twelfth of December, 1759, I was de&s;ired by a gentleman of the Faculty to attend the wife of Andrew Montier, of Knottingley, &s;uppo&s;ed to be then in a fit of the &s;tone or gravel. Being that day en|gaged, I recommended what I thought mo&s;t proper from the information given me, and de&s;ired if &s;he was not re|lieved by the pre&s;cription, to be informed, in order that I might vi&s;it her.&mdash;I heard no more of the ca&s;e from that day until the &s;eventh of January 1760, when I was in|treated to go and &s;ee her. I then found her advanced five months in her pregnancy, and in a mo&s;t deplorable &s;itua|tion;
<PB N="23" REF="26">&s;he informed me that for a month pa&s;t &s;he had been in con&s;tant pain, which fir&s;t began with a difficulty of making water, and a trifling pain about the neck of the bladder; for which her midwife ordered her &s;omething, and &s;he had al&s;o taken medicines from her apothecary, in hopes to carry it off, but to no purpo&s;e. On the con|trary, the pain increa&s;ed every day, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine came on, and it was with difficulty &s;he could part with any &s;tool for &s;ome time pa&s;t: that about the twenty-ninth of December the pain in her body was very great; and, as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it, bore down violently; and as &s;he could neither di&s;charge urine nor &s;tool, that &s;he had &s;ent again for her midwife, believing &s;he was going to mi&s;carry, who &s;taid with her &s;ome time, and gave every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her power by opiates, cly&s;ters, &amp;c. notwith&s;tanding which her &s;ufferings hourly increa&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s and vomit|ings; nay, for twenty-four hours before I &s;aw her, &s;he had vomited up what ought to have gone down.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27">
<P>I FOUND her &s;unk and emaciated to the la&s;t degree; her pul&s;e &s;carcely to be felt, and this attended with fre|quent faintings, cold &s;weats, and a cadaverous &s;mell. But for a few hours preceding my vi&s;it, the pains in the pelvis had left her.</P>
<P>IN this mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ituation I doubted whether or no I &s;hould attempt any thing; but, for &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, as her body was greatly di&s;tended, I pa&s;&s;ed the catheter, and drew off five pints of a dark grumous cof|fee-coloured water, which towards the latter end was bloody.</P>
<P>AFTER this I pa&s;&s;ed the os externum with my finger, and found the fundus uteri in the vagina, below the ex|tremity of the os coccygis, pre&s;&s;ing the perinoeum, and the anus dilated the breadth of a &s;hilling, the parts di&s;|charging a mo&s;t offen&s;ive matter. With &s;ome difficulty I pa&s;&s;ed my finger up to the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis, where I found the collum uteri pre&s;&s;ed quite flat again&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="28">the pubis, at the very brim of the pelvis, the os inter|num being open the breadth of a &s;ixpence. But the tu|mor pre&s;&s;ed the rectum &s;o clo&s;e to the os &s;acrum, that I could not pa&s;s the os coccygis with my finger.</P>
<P>THESE parts being in a &s;tate of mortification, all far|ther attempts were vain:&mdash;I thought it my duty however, before I left her, to make the apothecary and midwife who attended, perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;order being in|curable. The poor creature expired next day.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS dreadful ca&s;e naturally led me to con&s;ider what relief might have been given to the patient before the parts were &s;o injured as to leave no hopes of recovery, i. e. before the mortification had taken place.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="29">
<P>THE means which then occurred to me as the only probable and practicable ones, in &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ituation, were the&s;e;&mdash;fir&s;t to draw off the water and clear the rectum of feces:&mdash;&s;econdly, to endeavour by &s;ome me|thod to rupture the membranes, and di&s;charge the liquor amnii, which would greatly reduce the uterus in magni|tude; and having gained the&s;e two points, then at la&s;t to attempt a reduction in the way I have in general recom|mended.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e that hath occurred to me in practice, I have always been able to reach the os internum with my finger, and clearly to di&s;cover its form and &s;ituation. I have not therefore any doubt, even in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, where the collum uteri is flat, and the os internum opens a little, that I could, by per&s;evering in my efforts, pa&s;s the os internum with my finger, and rupture the membranes; at lea&s;t the trial in a ca&s;e of &s;uch imminent danger is warrantable. For it might &s;ave the patient, and could do no injury. But &s;hould it prove impracticable
<PB N="27" REF="30">with the finger, then I think it would be right to make the attempt with a female catheter, or &s;ome in&s;trument of that kind, having a point much more curved or hook|like.</P>
<P>IN doing this, whil&s;t I had one &s;inger at the os inter|num, I would pa&s;s the in&s;trument up on one &s;ide of the &s;ymphy&s;is of the pubis, with the point towards the other &s;ide; and, when advanced as high in the pelvis as the os internum, in&s;inuate the point into it; and then, by pu&s;hing the point downwards, and again&s;t the mem|branes, rupture them, and &s;o di&s;charge the liquor amnii. After which the reduction &s;hould immediately be &s;et about as in general directed.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;peculative &s;ugge&s;tions only thrown out for others of kappier talents to improve upon. But were a ca&s;e of this de&s;cription to fall under my care, even though the os internum &s;hould not be at all open, I would mo&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="31">certainly adopt the mode of proceeding now de&s;cribed, without the lea&s;t doubt of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;This at lea&s;t, I can affirm, is the only ca&s;e that has occurred to me, in which I did not &s;ave the patient.</P>

<HEAD>CASE THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<P>ON the eighteenth of September, 1761, James Hunter of Led&s;ham, &s;ix miles from Pontefract, be|lieving his wife was about to mi&s;carry, called on me to vi&s;it her, as the midwife of the place, who was with her, could give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was at a lo&s;s what to do.</P>
<P>As it was then late in the evening I &s;ent her an opiate; and vi&s;iting her in the morning following, was glad to hear from her&s;elf that &s;he was better; which &s;he attributed to having made more water than u&s;ual; but at the &s;ame
<PB N="30" REF="33">time &s;he told me, &s;he had been labouring for many days under a difficulty of making water, attended with an un|common pain about the neck of the bladder; that for the three or four la&s;t days &s;he could make little or none, nor could &s;he have a &s;tool without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of medicine, and concluded with &s;aying that &s;he had had a great deal of bearing-down pain in her body which hourly increa&s;ed. All this &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed was owing to her condition, being her fir&s;t pregnancy.</P>
<P>FROM this information I concluded what the ca&s;e was, and upon examination found the uterus inverted in the manner I have already de&s;cribed. I therefore drew off the water, evacuated the rectum, and &s;et about the re|duction exactly as I have generally directed.</P>
<P>BUT I did not find it an ca&s;y ta&s;k, as the force requi|&s;ite to be employed was very great: however, at the third effort I &s;ucceeded, and the uterus reverted into its natu|ral &s;ituation.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="34">
<P>AFTER &s;he had continued in bed a week, I found the parts in their proper form and &s;ituation; and no &s;ymp|toms of abortion appeared. She even went on to her full time, without any kind of inconvenience, and on the eighteenth of March, 1762, &s;he had a natural labour; when, being again &s;ent for, I delivered her of a daugh|ter, and all did well.</P>

<PB REF="35">
<HEAD>CASE THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>ON the twenty-&s;ixth day of February, 1764, I was called to the &s;ame patient a &s;econd time, whom I found in the like &s;ituation as before; only according to her own reckoning, a little farther advanced in her preg|nancy; and though &s;he had &s;o lately experienced the very &s;ame complaint, yet on this occa&s;ion &s;he did not apprehend any dangerous con&s;equence, believing her in|di&s;po&s;ition to proceed merely from holding her water too long, which did not by any means appear a &s;erious mat|ter to her.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36">
<P>AFTER taking every previous &s;tep to facilitate the re|duction of the uterus, I &s;et about it in the u&s;ual way; but found the uterus &s;o fa&s;t wedged in the pelvis, that I was obliged to make many efforts before I could accom|pli&s;h the reduction, the force required being very great. And I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that immediately before the uterus receded, a &s;mart gu&s;h of water came down upon my hand, which at the in&s;tant I &s;uppo&s;ed could be nothing but the liquor amnii: of which I was convinced by what followed. The uterus being replaced, the patient was put to bed, and the u&s;ual directions given. But when I called upon her four days after, I di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of an ap|proaching mi&s;carriage, which I foretold, and it accordingly happened the next day. My patient &s;oon recovered, and in a &s;hort time after removed to a town called Kippax, about two miles di&s;tant, in a high dry &s;ituation, where &s;he ac|quired a more robu&s;t habit of body. Since that time &s;he has had &s;everal children, without any return of the retro|ver&s;io uteri, and now lives at Kippax in perfect health, March the fir&s;t, 1785.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="37">
<P>I SHALL conclude with remarking that I could produce a con&s;iderable number of other ca&s;es, in which the Gra|vid uterus has been retroverted, that have fallen under my own immediate care; but as they contain nothing new, differ very little in their &s;ymptoms from the Fir&s;t, Third, or Fourth; and being treated exactly in the &s;ame way, terminated happily; I forbear to enumerate them, con|ceiving it would only give the reader unnece&s;&s;ary trouble.</P>
