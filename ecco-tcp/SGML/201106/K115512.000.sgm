<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AN Hydrocele is &s;o irk&s;ome a di&s;ea&s;e to the indigent and la|borious, furni&s;hes even the ea&s;y and opulent with &s;uch di&s;agreeable ideas and apprehen&s;ions, and is to all who are afflicted with it &s;o trouble&s;ome and in|convenient, that every rational attempt toward relieving mankind from &s;uch an evil, will, I make no doubt, be favour|ably received.</P>
<P>It is now &s;ome years &s;ince I fir&s;t began to make particular inquiry into the nature of this, and &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle, and the u&s;ual methods of treat|ing
<PB N="2" REF="3">them; an inquiry, which they ap|peared to me, for many rea&s;ons, both to de&s;erve, and require. The re&s;ult I com|municated to the public, under the title of, A "Treati&s;e on the Hydrocele, or Watry Rupture, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle, its coats and ve&s;&s;els;" in which I endeavoured to be as preci&s;e, and as explicit as I could.</P>
<P>One part of this tract contains an exa|mination of the various means, which have at different times, either accidentally produced a radical cure, or have been profe&s;&s;edly propo&s;ed, and practi&s;ed for &s;uch purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Among other means u&s;ed to obtain this end, I mentioned the Seton; and &s;pake of it as that, which for many rea&s;ons, appeared to me to be prefera|ble to all others; as a method which I
<PB N="3" REF="4">had for &s;ome time practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, and as that, which if nothing &s;hould occur to induce me to change my opinion, I &s;hould continue to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Since that time I have had frequent opportunities of repeating the experi|ment, and it has &s;o con&s;tantly, and uni|formly an&s;wered my expectation, that my opinion concerning it is determined, and I am convinced, that it is the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully efficacious of any.</P>
<P>This might be urged, and would per|haps be admitted as a good rea&s;on for laying my thoughts on the &s;ubject again before the public; but I have others al&s;o to plead in vindication of the few following pages.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I think that I have con&s;iderably and materially improved the operation and proce&s;s; and have render|ed it le&s;s painful, and more certain.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd, I find, that what I &s;aid of it in the general treati&s;e, has not been &s;o clearly and perfectly under&s;tood as I could have wi&s;hed; and in con&s;equence either of brevity and ob&s;curity on my part, or mi&s;intelligence on the part of &s;ome of my readers, my true meaning has not been received, and I have been &s;ubjected to the frequent interruption of trouble&s;ome corre&s;pondences on the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>And, in the third place, I might add, that &s;ome few gentlemen of con&s;equence, who have by this means been cured, have reque&s;ted this publication.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<P>A minute account of the nature and circum&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e, would be a mere repetition of what I have already &s;aid at large in the book referred to; would be therefore unnece&s;&s;ary, and be|&s;ide my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; a &s;hort and cur&s;ory one may perhaps throw ju&s;t as much light on the &s;ubject, as may &s;erve to render the de&s;cription of the opera|tion, and the treatment after it, more ea&s;ily intelligible.</P>
<P>The common bag in which both the te&s;ticles are included, is called the Scro|tum, and con&s;i&s;ts of epidermis, &s;kin, and that loo&s;e cellular membrane, which is here called the Dartos; to which might perhaps be added, the expanded fibres of the crema&s;ter mu&s;cle on each &s;ide. The proper coats of the te&s;ticle, are, the tunica albuginea, and the tunica va|ginalis. The former of the&s;e immedi|ately
<PB N="6" REF="7">inve&s;ts the va&s;cular compages of the te&s;tis, and is that coat with which it is covered while within the cavity of the abdomen, before birth. The latter is form|ed on the out&s;ide of the &s;aid cavity, is a proce&s;s of the peritoneum, and is placed ready for the reception of the te&s;ticle when it &s;hall be thru&s;t forth, thro' the groin, into the &s;crotum. Between the va&s;cular &s;tructure of the te&s;ticle, and the tunica albuginea, there is no vacuity, but the external &s;urface of the gland, is in every part firmly adherent to, and connected with the internal one of the inve&s;ting coat; the tunica vaginalis forms a hollow cavity, or bag, which loo&s;ely, and unconnectedly envelopes the te&s;ticle, covered by its albuginea.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay loo&s;ely and unconnected|ly, I would wi&s;h to be under&s;tood aright. I do not mean that the te&s;ticle hangs
<PB N="7" REF="8">in the middle of the tunica vaginalis, (like a clapper within a bell) and has no connection with it; I mean, that all the &s;uperior, anterior, and lateral parts of the tunica vaginalis are loo&s;e from, and un|connected with the te&s;ticle, which is at the &s;ame time firmly united to its po&s;te|rior part, in &s;uch manner, that if the cavity of the tunica vaginalis was to be di&s;tended with wind, &s;uch wind would occupy, or fill all the loo&s;e, and uncon|nected part, and produce a tumefaction not unlike to a hydrocele, while the te|&s;ticle would be found firmly and im|moveably attached to the hinder part of the &s;aid cavity &s;o di&s;tended.</P>
<P>To prevent the accretion of the&s;e coats in tho&s;e parts where they ought to be unconnected, and perhaps for &s;ome other purpo&s;es, the cavity of the tunica vagi|nalis is furni&s;hed with a fine lymph
<PB N="8" REF="9">con&s;tantly ex&s;uding into it; which lymph is as con&s;tantly ab&s;orbed by proper ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that, in a healthy and natural &s;tate, there never is any more of this fluid, within the bag, at a time, than may ju&s;t &s;erve (be&s;ide what other purpo&s;e it may be intended for) to keep the two mem|branes from coming into immediate dry contact, and cohe&s;ion with each other. This &s;mall quantity is &s;ufficient to pre|&s;erve the proper and natural cavity of the tunic, but never occa&s;ions any de|gree of intume&s;cence, or any unnatural or di&s;ea&s;ed appearance of the part.</P>
<P>A deficiency, or total failure of the &s;ecretion of this fluid, will be followed by a partial, or total coale&s;cence of the two coats, with each other; and con&s;e|quently a total or partial abolition of the cavity, a &s;uper-abundance, or a &s;e|cretion of more than the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els
<PB REF="10">
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a single testicle inside an opened scrotal sac</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="9" REF="11">can take up, mu&s;t, on the other hand, inlarge and di&s;tend, the &s;aid cavity, by carrying all the loo&s;e unconnected part of the bag farther and farther from the te&s;ticle, in proportion to the quantity ac|cumulated. The former, I do know to be &s;ometimes, and I verily believe mo&s;t frequently is, the con&s;equence of a &s;evere hernia humoralis, as well as of other in|flammations of the te&s;ticle. The latter among other di&s;ea&s;es produces the hy|drocele or watry rupture.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, that is, the in|tume&s;cence of the &s;crotal bag, being cau&s;ed by the gradual accumulation of a fluid, which ought to have been ab&s;orbed, it is almo&s;t always produced gradually; and therefore has, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, made &s;ome progre&s;s before it is taken notice of; e&s;pecially by carele&s;s and in|attentive people. For the &s;ame rea&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="12">it will be found, that as it depends upon the circum&s;tances of &s;ecretion and ab|&s;orption, it will in different people, make quicker or &s;lower progre&s;s, according as the depo&s;ition &s;hall happen to be quicker or &s;lower, and the ab&s;orbent faculty, only more or le&s;s impaired, or totally ob&s;tructed. As this di&s;ea&s;e is confined to the cavity of the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis, and as this bag has no commu|nication with the cavity of the belly, the tumefaction can never be le&s;&s;ened by any attempt toward reducing or re|turning it into the abdomen. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it never is, nor can be liable to any alteration of &s;ize, or temporary di&s;tention from the efforts, or actions of coughing, &s;neezing, expul&s;ion of foeces, &amp;c. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, (I mean the confinement of the fluid within the ca|vity of the tunica vaginalis) the intu|me&s;cence, when early attended to, will
<PB N="11" REF="13">always be found in the lower part, and does not ri&s;e above the upper-part of the te&s;ticle, until the di&s;ea&s;e has made &s;ome progre&s;s, and the quantity is be|come con&s;iderable; therefore the &s;per|matic proce&s;s, will always, in the early &s;tage of this di&s;temper, be capable of be|ing felt perfectly and di&s;tinctly; altho' when the tumour has arrived to any con|&s;iderable degree of &s;ize, the fluid does &s;o conceal the te&s;ticle, as to render it not a very ea&s;y matter to find it. The three la&s;t circum&s;tances, well attended to, will always &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h the hydro|cele from the inte&s;tinal hernia or com|mon rupture, at lea&s;t in the beginning. To the&s;e might be added, &s;everal other characteri&s;tical marks of this di&s;temper; &s;uch as, that being neither accompanied by, nor occa&s;ioning any inflammation, or irritation, it never gives pain, unle&s;s it be very rudely handled, or be permit|ted
<PB N="12" REF="14">to attain &s;uch &s;ize as to be trouble|&s;ome from its weight, or to be &s;ubject to excoriation from its magnitude; which may &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the her|nia humoralis, an inflammatory, and often a very painful di&s;order. That if the fluid be thin and limpid, and the vaginal coat and membranes of the &s;cro|tum not thick, the tumour is often in &s;ome degree tran&s;parent; that is, the light of a candle or lamp may be &s;een through it. That con&s;tipation of belly does not render it at all more ten&s;e, or produce any unea&s;ine&s;s in it while it la&s;ts; neither does the removal of &s;uch ob&s;truction or con&s;tipation at all le&s;&s;en its volume, or make any alteration in it either to the eye, or to the finger. To all which ought always to be added, the <HI>fluctuation of the fluid.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="15">
<P>The &s;ize and figure of the tumour cau&s;ed by this di&s;ea&s;e are liable to con|&s;iderable variety, dependant upon the quantity and con&s;i&s;tence of the fluid accumulated, the time &s;uch accumula|tion may have taken up, the thickne&s;s, or thinne&s;s of the vaginal bag, and mem|branes of the &s;crotum, and the equal or unequal manner in which the&s;e parts may have given way to the di&s;tention. Hence the tumour will be larger or &s;maller, round, flatti&s;h, pyriform, or globular; will be firm, ten&s;e, and re&s;i|&s;tent, or lax, &s;oft and ea&s;ily compre&s;&s;ible; &s;mooth and regular in its &s;urface, mak|ing one uniform figure, or divided by a kind of depre&s;&s;ion or &s;tricture, which will make it appear as if the water was in two di&s;tinct &s;acculi or bags; it will al&s;o be more or le&s;s ten&s;e, as well as regular in its &s;urface, as the contractile power
<PB N="14" REF="16">of the &s;crotum, by means of the cre|ma&s;ter mu&s;cles, &s;hall be more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>The qualities of con&s;i&s;tence and co|lour in the contained fluid is al&s;o various: it is thin, aqueous, roapy, vi&s;cid, lim|pid, citrine, greeni&s;h, brown, bloody, clear, or turbid; from each of which &s;ome &s;mall differences in the a&s;pect, feel, weight, tran&s;parency or ob&s;curity of the tumour will ari&s;e; but are of no con|&s;equence with regard to any method of treatment, palliative, or radical.</P>
<P>The methods of cure of a hydrocele are &s;aid to be two, one called the Pal|liative, the other the Radical; the lat|ter of which alone de&s;erves the name of cure.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<P>The former con&s;i&s;ts merely in letting out the water occa&s;ionally, and is &s;o &s;imple and &s;o trifling an operation, that I &s;hall &s;ay nothing more of it, than that I think a &s;mall trochar a much preferable in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e on all accounts to the lancet, or any other.</P>
<P>The radical cures, as they are called, may be collected from the writings of &s;everal of our predece&s;&s;ors. The general means they made u&s;e of were cautery, cau&s;tic, ligature, and tent. For the particulars relative to each of the&s;e, I mu&s;t beg leave to refer my reader to the writers them&s;elves, a minute detail of them not being con&s;i&s;tent with the plan of the&s;e few &s;heets. But without entering into &s;uch di&s;qui&s;ition, I believe I may venture to &s;ay, that whoever will give him&s;elf this trouble, will find, that
<PB N="16" REF="18">all the means which were either pro|fe&s;&s;edly u&s;ed to obtain a radical cure, or which ultimately and accidentally pro|duced &s;uch event, were put in practice for three general rea&s;ons, or under the influence of three general opinions; the fir&s;t of which was, that the fluid found in the &s;ac of a hydrocele was always originally formed in the cavity of the belly, and de&s;cended from thence into the &s;crotum; the &s;econd, that it was a di&s;ea&s;e of the habit, as well as of the particular part; that is, that it was gene|ral, as well as local; the third, that the collection of liquor found in it, was either the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e, or the con|&s;equence, of a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the te&s;tis.</P>
<P>From the&s;e flow the applications of cautery, and cau&s;tics to the groin, and of ligatures on the &s;permatic proce&s;s.
<PB N="17" REF="19">From the&s;e are derived all the cautions to undertake the cure guardedly, to conduct it &s;lowly, and to attend rigidly to the pa|tient's general &s;tate by cathartics, altera|tives, &s;pecifics, i&s;&s;ues, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and to the&s;e we owe the experiments made to induce &s;uppuration from the parts affected.</P>
<P>Not being acquainted with the anato|mical &s;tructure and di&s;po&s;ition of the parts concerned in the di&s;ea&s;e, they had very terrible as well as very erroneous no|tions concerning it. They &s;uppo&s;ed that the fluid contained in the cy&s;t was thrown off from the habit as a kind of cri&s;is; that the general con&s;titution of the patient was by &s;uch depo&s;ition much relieved; that it prevented many other, and tho&s;e wor&s;e di&s;orders; and, either that a morbid &s;tate of the te&s;ticle and epidydimis concurred in producing the fluid, or that the &s;ame parts nece&s;&s;arily became di&s;ea&s;ed from ly|ing in it. They therefore concluded,
<PB N="18" REF="20">that although a radical or perfect cure might be obtained by certain means, or that certain means having been found now and then to have produced &s;uch event, they might with probability be expected to an&s;wer &s;uch purpo&s;e, yet the attempt ought never to be made without a &s;trict attention to the general evils which might en&s;ue, as well as to the particular ones proceeding from the &s;uppo&s;ed morbid &s;tate of the parts.</P>
<P>Inquiry and experiment have taught us better, have given us truer notions of the nature of the complaint, have induced us totally to lay a&s;ide many of the means u&s;ed by our fore-fathers, and although we do &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort continue &s;ome of them, yet it is upon different principles, and with very different views.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="21">
<P>The noxious quality of the fluid, the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the parts whence it pro|ceeds, or wherein it is depo&s;ited, the cri|tical, or depuratory nature of the depo&s;i|tion, the nece&s;&s;ity of drawing off the wa|ter partially and at &s;hort intervals, and the fear of curing it locally le&s;t the general habit &s;hould &s;uffer, are all now known to be groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions; and it being al&s;o known that the collection of fluid is originally made in the tunica vaginalis only, and that it does not de&s;cend from the belly, all attempts toward preventing &s;uch de&s;cent are become equally ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The te&s;ticle, although frequently &s;ome|what inlarged in its dimen&s;ions and re|laxed in its texture, is known to be &s;ound, to be otherwi&s;e unaffected, and unaltered, and to be fit for, and capable of perform|ing the functions it was de&s;igned to exe|cute; the fluid is acknowledged to be in|noxious
<PB N="20" REF="22">in its nature, neither proceeding from parts in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, nor cau&s;ing any di&s;ea&s;e in the parts in which it is de|po&s;ited, and with which it is in contact; but being accumulated in con&s;equence of con&s;tant &s;ecretion, and deficient, or non|executed ab&s;orption, the intention of every rational practitioner, when he aims at a radical cure, is, to aboli&s;h the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, and thereby to pre|vent any future collection.</P>
<P>Whatever means can accompli&s;h this end with the lea&s;t fatigue, pain, or hazard, are certainly the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the inci&s;ion I &s;hall in this place &s;ay nothing, except that it lies under &s;o many re&s;traints from a variety of circum&s;tances, is &s;o improper for the majority of per|&s;ons afflicted with the di&s;ea&s;e, and requires &s;uch nice attention and &s;uch judicious ma|nagement, that it never can be recom|mended as fit for general practice.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="23">
<P>The cau&s;tic, upon the rational principle of which I am now &s;peaking, viz. that of aboli&s;hing the cavity of the tunica va|ginalis, has been practi&s;ed by many, and that with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as to induce &s;ome to think it the be&s;t and mo&s;t eligible me|thod: Among the&s;e is Mr. El&s;e, who has lately publi&s;hed his opinion on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The introduction of &s;uppurative medi|cines by means of a tent, was practi&s;ed by &s;ome of even our remote predece&s;&s;ors, and as they tell us with &s;ucce&s;s, even in complicated ca&s;es; that is, in ca&s;es where a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the te&s;ticle has been ad|ded to the hydrocele: But whoever will attentively con&s;ider their accounts of this matter will &s;ee, that this method, what|ever might be its accidental con&s;equence, was not intended for the purpo&s;e which I am now &s;peaking of.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="24">
<P>Perhaps there is no part of &s;urgery which was le&s;s under&s;tood by our ance&s;|tors, or concerning which they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with &s;o little preci&s;ion as the &s;ubject of di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle: they have multiplied and confounded them in &s;uch manner, and &s;peak of them in &s;uch a jargon of unintelligible terms, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand often what they really mean.</P>
<P>For a particular elucidation of this &s;ubject the chirurgic world are much ob|liged to the late Profe&s;&s;or Monro of Edin|burgh, and Mr. Samuel Sharp, late of Guy's Ho&s;pital, now of Bath.</P>
<P>The accounts which many of the be&s;t among the writers in &s;urgery, even quite into our own time, have given of the di&s;|ea&s;es of the&s;e parts under the terms &s;arco|cele, fungus attached to the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, fungus ari&s;ing from the te&s;tis, hy|drocele
<PB N="23" REF="25">and hydro-&s;arcocele, are error it&s;elf; and the operations which they de&s;cribe and recommend are many of them coar&s;e, and either impracticable, or very unfit for practice. But however from the&s;e ac|counts, &s;trange and irrational as they are, we may collect that they conceived the di&s;|ea&s;es which they call the hydro-&s;arcocele, and the caro adnata ad va&s;a &s;permatica, to be (in contradi&s;tinction from the &s;arco|cele and the fungus &s;pringing from the te&s;ticle,) curable di&s;ea&s;es, the one by extir|pation of the fungus, the other by &s;up|puration.</P>
<P>No preci&s;e definition of what they have thought proper to call the hydro-&s;arcocele has been given by them, and therefore we have no better method of forming a judg|ment concerning it, than by con&s;idering the event and &s;ucce&s;s of their method of treating what they have &s;o called, with what we know concerning the &s;tructure
<PB N="24" REF="26">of the te&s;ticle, its di&s;orders, the means which we now find to be &s;ucce&s;sful in them, and the di&s;appointments, and di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tances which &s;ometimes occur in them.</P>
<P>Frabritius ab Aquapendente has been particular on what he calls the hydro|&s;arcocele, and has given an account of his method of curing it; but whoever is ac|quainted with di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle, and will compare with &s;uch knowledge what Fabritius has &s;aid concerning his method and its &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Si carno&s;a-&s;imul et aquo&s;a &s;it hernia ego talem adhibeo curam.

<P>That by his method he obtained a radi|cal cure I make no doubt; his 'turunda dige&s;tivo, et pus movente medicamento imbuta,' would mo&s;t probably occa&s;ion a &s;loughing of the tunica vaginalis, and con|&s;equently an abolition of the bag or ca|vity; but whoever knows any thing of the&s;e matters mu&s;t know, that a te&s;ticle really and truly di&s;ea&s;ed, would not bear &s;uch treatment; and therefore that his &s;ucce&s;s was owing to the &s;tate of the te&s;ti|cle <HI>not being</HI> what he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be, and what the term he makes u&s;e of im|plies.</P>

<P>The means and conduct were nearly the &s;ame, and I have no doubt that the &s;ucce&s;s was equal. But the &s;ame objection &s;till remained; which was, that not only a &s;uppuration was brought on, but the whole tunica vaginalis was &s;o irritated and inflamed, that it nece&s;&s;arily became &s;loughy, and was entirely de&s;troyed. An objection which had been made to the method by cau&s;tic, and which I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
<PB N="27" REF="29">is, in my opinion, an objec|tion to it &s;till.</P>
<P>The late profe&s;&s;or Monro, who&s;e ob|&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle are very pertinent and very ingenious, &s;eemed to think that it was by no means impracticable, by means of a &s;light degree of irritation, to excite &s;uch an inflam|mation both in the tunica vaginalis and al|buginea, as might occa&s;ion a coale&s;cence of them with each other, and thereby an&s;wer the end of aboli&s;hing the cavity without de&s;troying any part of either tunic.</P>
<P>I made the experiment propo&s;ed by him, and found it &s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sful, ne|ver hazardous, or prejudicial, but by no means certainly efficacious, or to be de|pended upon. The cannula by its hard|ne&s;s and re&s;i&s;tance was a very unplea&s;ant gue&s;t within the vaginal coat, and from
<PB N="28" REF="30">its inflexibility, upon any unguarded mo|tion of the patient, injured the te&s;ticle and gave very acute pain; and the tent and bougie, which I occa&s;ionally &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, although they did not give &s;o much pain, were liable to a con&s;iderable degree of uncertainty.</P>
<P>Uncertainty and hazard are certainly very different things, and the latter much preferable to the former: not to have injured a man by an experiment, affords &s;ome degree of con&s;olation under a di&s;ap|pointment, but yet when it is con&s;idered, that an operation and proce&s;s of this kind is &s;ubmitted to from choice and not from nece&s;&s;ity, if it fails of &s;ucce&s;s, although no real harm be done either to the part, or to the con&s;titution of the patient, both the lo&s;s of time and the confinement will become doubly irk&s;ome, as they will be found not only not to have an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed, but not to have brought
<PB N="29" REF="31">the patient at all nearer to a cure than he was before the attempts. The reflexion is unplea&s;ant to both parties.</P>
<P>Being, from the effects both of the ca|nula and tent, &s;atisfied that there was no kind of hazard in the introduction of a fo|reign body into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, nor from its remaining there; and having many opportunities of meeting with this di&s;ea&s;e in St. Bartholomew's, I de|termined to try what a &s;eton would do to|ward rai&s;ing &s;uch a degree of inflamma|tion as might occa&s;ion a coalition of the two membranes, and effect the purpo&s;e propo&s;ed by Profe&s;&s;or Monro<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His words are, <Q><P>"Con&s;idering how readily con|tiguous inflamed parts grow together, and how many in&s;tances there are of people having a radi|cal cure made of this hydrocele by inflammations coming on the part, it would &s;eem no unrea&s;onable practice to endeavour a concretion of the two coats of the te&s;ticle when they are brought contiguous, after letting out the water through the cannula of a trochar, by artfully rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient degree of inflammation.</P>
<P>This to be &s;ure mu&s;t be done cautiou&s;ly, and &s;o that the &s;urgeon can rea&s;onably expect to be ma&s;|ter of the inflammation, and therefore the applica|tion of all irritating medicines, the operation of which he could not immediately &s;top, or any &s;in|gle mechanical effort the effect of which he could not be &s;ure of, are not to be employed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the canula of the trochar was to be left, by the extremity of it rubbing again&s;t the te&s;ticle an inflammation might be artfully rai&s;ed, the cau&s;e of which might be taken away as &s;oon as the &s;ur|geon thought fit."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Medical E&s;&s;ays.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. The &s;uc|ce&s;s fully an&s;wered my expectation.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="32">
<P>In my general treati&s;e on the di&s;ea&s;es of the te&s;ticle, I mentioned and recom|mended it, but as I could not be certain what a greater length of time might produce to make me change my opinion, I mentioned it with &s;ome degree of cau|tion.</P>
<P>Since that time I have embraced every opportunity, both in the ho&s;pital and out, of practi&s;ing it, and that under
<PB N="31" REF="33">&s;ome improvements; and as I can now &s;peak po&s;itively to its &s;ucce&s;s, I thought it right to give it to the publick, who are always intituled to every benefit ari|&s;ing from the labours of every man whom they have honoured with any degree of confidence, and this as well on a principle of humanity as of gratitude.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid of it in the general treati&s;e is in the following words, p. 176. </P>
<Q><P>"The point to be aimed at, is to excite &s;uch a degree of inflammation both, in the tunica vaginalis and tunica albugi|nea, as &s;hall occa&s;ion a general and per|fect cohe&s;ion between them; and this, if po&s;&s;ible, without the production of &s;lough or ab&s;ce&s;s; without the hazard of gangrene, and without that degree of &s;ymptomatic fever which now and then attend both the cau&s;tic and the inci|&s;ion; and which, when they do hap|pen,
<PB N="32" REF="34">are &s;o alarming both to patient and &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>The&s;e ends I have frequently ob|tained by the u&s;e of a &s;eton.</P>
<P>It is a method of cure mentioned by Aquapendens from Guido, and others before him, though their proce&s;s was &s;omewhat different from mine. I have &s;everal times tried it on &s;ubjects of very different ages, &s;ome of them more than fifty years old. It requires confine|ment to bed only for a few days, after which the patient may lye upon a couch to the end of the attendance, which is generally fini&s;hed in about three weeks or a month at farthe&s;t, and during all that time no other proce&s;s or regimen is nece&s;&s;ary, than what an in|flammation of the &s;ame part from any other cau&s;e, (for example a hernia hu|moralis) would require.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="35">
<P>The manner of performing it is as follows. Choo&s;e a time when the vaginal coat is moderately di&s;tended, and having pierced it with a trochar, of tolerable &s;ize, draw off the water; when that is done, introduce into the cannula a probe armed with a &s;eton con&s;i&s;ting of ten or twelve &s;trings of candle-wick cotton; pa&s;s the probe as high to the upper part of the vaginal coat as you can, and on the end of that probe make an inci&s;ion of &s;uch &s;ize as to enable you to pull it out ea&s;ily, together with a part of its an|nexed &s;eton; then cut off the probe, and tie the cotton very loo&s;ely, co|vering the orifices with pledgets. By the next day the &s;eton will be found to have contracted &s;uch an adhe&s;ion to the tunica albuginea as would cau&s;e a great deal of pain to detach; but this it is perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary to do, and it
<PB N="34" REF="36">&s;hould be &s;uffered to remain without mole&s;tation. In about forty-eight hours the &s;crotum and te&s;ticle begin to &s;well and inflame; the patient &s;hould then lo&s;e &s;ome blood, and have a &s;tool or two, and the whole tumefied part &s;hould be wrapped in a &s;oft poultice, and &s;u&s;pended in a bag-tru&s;s. The di&s;ea&s;e from this time bears the ap|pearance of a large hernia humoralis, and mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame man|ner, by fomentation, catapla&s;m, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The adhe&s;ion of the &s;eton to the albuginea generally continues firm, and I never meddle with, or move it, till it becomes perfectly loo&s;e, which it &s;eldom does for the fir&s;t fortnight, or until the inflammation is going and the tumor &s;ub&s;iding. By the time the &s;eton be|comes loo&s;e, the coalition of parts is univer&s;ally and firmly accompli&s;hed. I
<PB N="35" REF="37">then withdraw it, and heal the orifices with a &s;uperficial pledgit, &amp;c."</P></Q>
<P>This method was, as I &s;aid in, general very &s;ucce&s;sful; but repeated trials fur|ni&s;hed me with objections to &s;ome parts of it, and induced me to think that &s;uch parts might be amended.</P>
<P>I found that cutting upon the end of the probe was trouble&s;ome, both from its &s;malne&s;s and from its flexibility, and al&s;o that it was &s;ometimes difficult to keep it &s;teady, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, and that it always required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ano|ther per&s;on's hand be&s;ides that of the operator: a circum&s;tance one would al|ways wi&s;h to avoid when po&s;&s;ible. I found al&s;o &s;ometimes that the &s;eton of candle-wick cotton did not pa&s;s &s;o ea&s;ily as I could wi&s;h, and by rubbing the tunica albuginea too rudely gave more pain than I liked. The &s;eton as made of cotton
<PB N="36" REF="38">adhered in &s;ome in&s;tances too long and too firmly. From the intimate connec|tion of the parts of the wet cotton with each other, it could never be brought away but entire, which in &s;ome ca&s;es oc|ca&s;ioned an unnece&s;&s;ary wa&s;te of time. And, what was &s;till wor&s;e, in two in|&s;tances it adhered &s;o firmly, that I was obliged to make a &s;mall inci&s;ion to get it away at all.</P>
<P>All the&s;e inconveniences and objections I have now obviated and removed.</P>
<P>The in&s;truments I now make u&s;e of are in the annexed plate, and are,</P>
<P>A trochar, the diameter of who&s;e can|nula is very nearly, but not quite, one fourth of an inch. Another cannula, which I call the &s;eton-cannula, which is made of &s;ilver, and is of &s;uch diameter
<PB REF="39">
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of three medical instruments placed side by side, the trochar, seton-cannula, and a probe</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="37" REF="40">as ju&s;t ea&s;ily to pa&s;s through the cannula of the trochar, its length five inches, and a probe of &s;ix inches one-half long, hav|ing at one extremity a fine &s;teel trochar point, and at the other an eye which car|ries the &s;eton; which &s;eton con&s;i&s;ts of ju&s;t &s;o much &s;trong, coar&s;e, white, &s;ewing &s;ilk as will without difficulty pa&s;s through the latter cannula, but at the &s;ame time will fill it.</P>
<P>With the trochar the inferior and an|terior part of the tumor is to be pierced, as in common palliative tapping: as &s;oon as the water is di&s;charged, and the perfo|rator withdrawn, the &s;eton-cannula is to be pa&s;&s;ed through that of the tro|char, until it reaches the upper part of the tunica vaginalis, and is to be felt in the very upper part of the &s;crotum. This done, the probe armed with its &s;eton is to be conveyed through the latter can|nula, the vaginal coat and integuments
<PB N="38" REF="41">to be pierced by its point, and the &s;eton to be drawn through the cannula, until a &s;ufficient quantity is brought out by the upper orifice. The two cannulae are then to be withdrawn, and the operation is fini&s;hed. It is executed in two or three &s;econds of time, and with little more pain than is felt in common tap|ping.</P>
<P>By this method, every advantage which attended the former operation is obtained, and every inconvenience which it was lia|ble to, is obviated and provided again&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;eton-cannula by its firmne&s;s bears tight again&s;t the place where the &s;eton &s;hould be brought out, the trochar-point of the probe is kept from deviating by its confinement, and its point pierces through the &s;kin immediately, and ex|actly in the place intended, while the &s;e|ton by pa&s;&s;ing through the cannula is
<PB N="39" REF="42">prevented from rubbing rudely over the te&s;ticle.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the operation is fini&s;hed I put the patient into bed, and immedi|ately give him twenty or twenty-five drops of tinctura thebaica, which I re|peat or not, pro ne nata.</P>
<P>About the third day the te&s;ticle and &s;crotum begin to inflame and &s;well, and to put on the appearance of a hernia hu|moralis, or the &s;welled te&s;ticle which now and then attends a clap; and re|quires the &s;ame and no other kind of treatment; that is, fomentation, poultice, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ory bag, a cool temperate regi|men, and an open belly.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the inflammation is &s;oon and ea&s;ily appea&s;ed. As &s;oon as this end is accompli&s;hed, I permit the patient to get out of bed and lie on a couch, or
<PB N="40" REF="43">&s;it in a great chair with his legs up, and I generally give the cortex in &s;ome form or other twice or thrice a day.</P>
<P>The &s;orene&s;s and tumefaction now di|mini&s;h apace, and as &s;oon as the parts are quite ea&s;y, which is generally about the tenth or twelfth day, I begin to withdraw the &s;eton, taking out, four, five, &s;ix, or &s;even threads of it at each dre&s;&s;ing, which dre&s;&s;ing con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than a &s;uperficial pledget upon each of the ori|fices while they continue open, and a di&s;cutient cerate (&s;uch as the ceratum &s;aturnin.) to cover the &s;crotum.</P>
<P>The di&s;charge of matter from the ori|fices, is &s;mall and trifling, no more than might be expected; the tunica vaginalis does not become &s;loughy, but is pre&s;erv|ed intire, and the cure is accompli&s;hed, merely by the coale&s;cence or cohe&s;ion of the tunica vaginalis, with the tunica al|buginea.
<PB N="41" REF="44">An event, which from what has fallen within my ob&s;ervation, I am inclined to believe, is mo&s;t frequently the con&s;equence of a &s;evere hernia humoralis.</P>
<P>In this circum&s;tance, viz. the accom|pli&s;hment of the cure, by adhe&s;ion of the two coats together, without any de|&s;truction of parts, con&s;i&s;ts the material difference between the method of cure by &s;eton, and that by cau&s;tic.</P>
<P>All the practitioners who make u&s;e of the latter, allow that it produces a &s;lough of the whole tunica vaginalis, that it de|&s;troys the whole bag or cy&s;t, and that it is u&s;ed with intention &s;o to do.</P>
<P>In the cure by &s;eton no &s;lough is pro|duced, (at lea&s;t I have never &s;een one) nor is the vaginal coat de&s;troyed in any part of it, a firm cohe&s;ion is made be|tween the two membranes occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="42" REF="45">the inflammation, and the cure is effected &s;olely thereby.</P>
<P>I &s;hall always mo&s;t gladly embrace any opportunity to improve &s;o noble and &s;o really u&s;eful an art as &s;urgery, but at the &s;ame time, &s;hould be very &s;orry to have it &s;uppo&s;ed that any partiality to my own opinion would make me mi&s;repre|&s;ent, or deviate from truth.</P>
<P>I have practi&s;ed this method of obtain|ing a radical cure on a very large number of &s;ubjects, of all ages, from &s;ix years old, to &s;ixty and upwards, in &s;ome &s;ub|jects on both &s;ides, and I have never &s;een any bad &s;ymptoms or any degree of hazard from it, nor have I once, &s;ince the pre|&s;ent improvement, &s;een it fail of perfect SUCCESS.</P>
