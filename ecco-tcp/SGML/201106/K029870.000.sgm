<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE BARBERS of <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Barbers</HI> of <HI>London</HI> were a <HI>Fraternity</HI> before the Time of <HI>Edward the Second,</HI> and by Letters-Patent of <HI>Edward the Fourth</HI> were made a <HI>Body Corporate,</HI> and inve&s;ted with &s;everal Powers and Pri|vileges. In the 32d Year of <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> the <HI>publick</HI> Policy thought proper to <HI>unite</HI> them with another Company (not then <HI>incorporated</HI>) called the <HI>Surgeons</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in order, (as is mo&s;t probable) to <HI>transfer</HI> tho&s;e Powers and Privileges to the <HI>latter,</HI> without directly appearing to <HI>wre&s;t</HI> them from the <HI>former</HI> to whom they had been <HI>originally</HI> granted.</P>
<P>This <HI>Coalition</HI> of the two Companies having now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted above <HI>Two Hundred Years,</HI> the <HI>Barbers</HI> are &s;urpris'd to find an <HI>Attempt</HI> made by the <HI>Surgeons</HI> to <HI>di&s;&s;olve</HI> it, by Authority of <HI>Parliament,</HI> without their Participation or Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>principal Rea&s;ons</HI> a&s;&s;igned by the <HI>Surgeons,</HI> in their printed Ca&s;e, to induce the Legi&s;lature to this <HI>extraordinary</HI> Act of Power, are,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Fir&s;t,"> That the <HI>Barbers,</HI> in the Time of <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> were <HI>all Sur|geons,</HI> and that the Parliament, by <HI>uniting</HI> them with others of <HI>&s;upe|rior</HI> Abilities, intended <HI>their</HI> Improvement in <HI>that</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion; but that they having, long &s;ince, <HI>cea&s;ed</HI> to intermeddle with any Branch of <HI>Surgery,</HI> this <HI>Intent</HI> of the Act is fru&s;trated, and the laudable <HI>Purpo&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI> at an end.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Secondly,"> That by this <HI>Alteration</HI> of the Circum&s;tances of things, the Junction of the two Companies (how advantageous &s;oever in <HI>former</HI> Times) is <HI>now</HI> become highly <HI>inconvenient.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Thirdly,"> That the <HI>Surgeons,</HI> if <HI>di&s;tinctly</HI> incorporated, would be encouraged to <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>communicate</HI> to one another their Experiments and Succe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="And Fourthly,"> That the like Separation has taken place at <HI>Paris, Edinburgh,</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;cow.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> is grounded on a <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> in point of <HI>Fact;</HI> for tho' it be <HI>true</HI> that the <HI>Barbers</HI> were <HI>all originally Surgeons,</HI> and incorporated <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> yet long <HI>before</HI> the Union in que&s;tion, <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of them had <HI>quitted</HI> the <HI>actual Exerci&s;e</HI> of that Profe&s;&s;ion, and the <HI>Right</HI> it&s;elf of exerci&s;ing it <HI>in virtue</HI> of their Charter, had been
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">3 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Ch.</HI> 11. No Per&s;on within the City of <HI>London,</HI> nor within &s;even Miles, &s;hall occupy as a <HI>Surgeon,</HI> except he be fir&s;t examined, approved, and admitted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> or Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s.</NOTE> <HI>taken away</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2">by Parliament: And tho' in the <HI>Preamble</HI> of the uniting Act, <HI>both</HI> Companies are &s;tiled <HI>Surgeons,</HI> yet from the
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Ch.</HI> 42. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3. No Per&s;on within the City of <HI>London,</HI> Suburbs of the &s;ame, and one Mile Compa&s;s of the &s;aid City, u&s;ing any Barbery or Shaving, &s;hall occupy any Sur|gery, Letting of Blood, or any other Thing belonging to Surgery, Drawing of Teeth only except.</NOTE> <HI>Enacting</HI> Part (which ex|pre&s;ly <HI>re&s;trains</HI> the <HI>Barbers</HI> from occupying any part of <HI>Surgery,</HI> except <HI>Tooth-drawing</HI>) it is evident the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> did not con&s;ider them as <HI>real</HI> Surgeons, nor could intend their <HI>Improvement</HI> in a Science they were <HI>forbid</HI> to <HI>practi&s;e,</HI> &s;o that the Circum&s;tances of Things are <HI>not</HI> altered from what they <HI>then</HI> were, or from what they manife&s;tly were <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to be; and therefore the <HI>Barbers</HI> having no Relation to the <HI>Surgeons,</HI> or their Art (as it was <HI>then</HI> deemed no <HI>Objection</HI> to their <HI>Union</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">annot <HI>now,</HI> with any Propriety, be in&s;i&s;ted on as a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for their <HI>Separation.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>Inconveniencies</HI> complained of, as the Charge is <HI>general,</HI> this <HI>general</HI> An&s;wer only can be given, That the <HI>Barbers</HI> have always, with the greate&s;t Deference, <HI>&s;ubmitted</HI> to the <HI>Surgeons</HI> in all Matters <HI>peculiar</HI> to them, and chearfully contributed, out of their <HI>com|mon</HI> Stock, towards every Expence which <HI>they</HI> have declared nece&s;&s;ary for the Honour or Advancement of <HI>their</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion. And &s;ince <HI>none</HI> of the&s;e Inconveniencies have been of Con&s;equence enough to de&s;erve being <HI>particularly</HI> pointed out, we may venture to pronounce them <HI>in|con&s;iderable,</HI> and unworthy the Attention and Redre&s;s of <HI>Parliament;</HI> and the rather, as <HI>all</HI> of them put together, have not prevented the <HI>Surgeons</HI> of <HI>London</HI> from carrying the Improvement of their Art, both in Speculation and Practice, to a greater Height than has been done in any other Place or Nation.</P>
<P>That the frequent Meetings of ingenious Men, and their free Com|munications on the Subject of their Profe&s;&s;ion, may tend <HI>to the Benefit of Mankind in general, and to the Honour of their Country in particular,</HI> is not denied: But &s;urely the Con&s;titution of the <HI>united</HI> Company is no ob&s;tacle to the&s;e laudable Purpo&s;es. The <HI>Barbers</HI> have for many Years, at their Monthly Courts, &s;ubmitted to <HI>withdraw</HI> at a &s;tated Hour, and <HI>re&s;igned</HI> the Parlour to the Surgeons: And if this <HI>Conde&s;cen|&s;ion</HI> is not &s;uppo&s;ed to afford them <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Time for Conver&s;ation on the&s;e <HI>particular</HI> Days, nothing <HI>hinders</HI> them from holding <HI>&s;eperate</HI> A&s;&s;emblies at the Hall almo&s;t <HI>every</HI> other Day in the Year.</P>
<P>As to what is &s;aid to have been done at <HI>Paris, Edinburgh,</HI> and <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> no <HI>particular</HI> an&s;wer can be given, unle&s;s it appeared by what <HI>Means,</HI> for what <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> and upon what <HI>Terms</HI> the <HI>Separations</HI> in tho&s;e Places were brought about. In <HI>London</HI> there are but two In&s;tances of Separations of Companies, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <HI>Feltmakers</HI> from the <HI>Haberda&s;hers</HI> in 1604, and that of the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> from the <HI>Grocers</HI> in 1617; but both the&s;e were effected by <HI>mutual</HI> Con&s;ent, without the Intervention of <HI>Parliament;</HI> and it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that the Feltmakers mi&s;carried in a former Application for an exclu&s;ive Charter in 1576 for <HI>want</HI> of the Haberda&s;hers Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, therefore, the <HI>Barbers</HI> humbly hope the forgoing Rea&s;ons will be deemed <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> to induce the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> to de&s;troy an <HI>Union</HI> they <HI>them&s;elves</HI> thought proper to <HI>form,</HI> an Union which two hundred Years Exi&s;tence has rendred <HI>venerable,</HI> and which, by
<PB N="3" REF="3">the <HI>Improvements</HI> above-mentioned, appears to have an&s;wered all the <HI>Purpo&s;es</HI> for which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But if for <HI>other</HI> Rea&s;ons (which the <HI>Surgeons</HI> &s;ay <HI>may</HI> be given) the Parliament &s;hall be inclined to favour them in <HI>this part</HI> of their Re|que&s;t; the <HI>Barbers,</HI> from the &s;crupulous Regard and Tenderne&s;s which that <HI>Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly</HI> has always &s;hewn for <HI>private Property,</HI> cannot but hope they &s;hall be <HI>continued</HI> in the Enjoyment of <HI>all</HI> their pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without any <HI>Divi&s;ion</HI> what&s;oever, and that, for the follow|ing Rea&s;ons:</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Fir&s;t,"> Becau&s;e mo&s;t of the <HI>united</HI> Company's Lands and Tenements, (particularly the Site of their <HI>Hall, Parlour, &amp;c.</HI>) originally belonged to <HI>them,</HI> and by the uniting Act
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Ch.</HI> 42. The united Company &s;hall have, po&s;&s;e&s;s, and enjoy, to them and their Succe&s;&s;ors for ever, all &s;uch Lands and Tenements, and other Hereditaments what&s;oever, which the &s;aid Company or Commonalty of <HI>Barbers</HI> have and enjoy, <HI>to the U&s;e</HI> of the &s;aid My&s;tery and Commonalty of <HI>Barbers</HI> of London.</NOTE> &s;eem with great Ju&s;tice to have been intended to remain to their <HI>&s;ole</HI> and <HI>&s;eparate</HI> U&s;e, tho' in fact the <HI>Sur|geons</HI> have hitherto been <HI>indulged</HI> in the <HI>equal</HI> Enjoyment of them with the <HI>Barbers.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Secondly,"> Becau&s;e the <HI>Surgeons Share</HI> of what may have been acquired <HI>&s;ince</HI> the Union, will &s;carce be an <HI>adequate</HI> Recompence to the <HI>Barbers</HI> for the above <HI>Indulgence,</HI> much le&s;s for the unmerited <HI>Lo&s;s</HI> of a Bro|therhood now &s;o <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>advantageous</HI> to them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Thirdly,"> Becau&s;e the Expences of the <HI>Barbers</HI> when <HI>di&s;tinctly</HI> incor|porated, can fall but very little, if any thing, &s;hort of tho&s;e of the <HI>united</HI> Company, &s;o that a Reduction of <HI>Income</HI> mu&s;t &s;ubject them to very great Difficulties, which (con&s;idering that <HI>they</HI> neither de&s;ire, nor have given the <HI>Surgeons</HI> ju&s;t Cau&s;e to de&s;ire a Separation) would be extremely hard and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="La&s;tly,"> Becau&s;e the pre&s;ent <HI>flouri&s;hing</HI> Condition of the <HI>Surgeons,</HI> (the only <HI>real</HI> Alteration in the Circum&s;tances of Things) will &s;ufficient|ly enable them to &s;upport the Dignity of their <HI>new</HI> and <HI>favourite</HI> In|&s;titution with becoming <HI>Splendor,</HI> without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their <HI>le&s;s happy</HI> Brethren the <HI>Barbers.</HI></P>
