<HEAD>A PILL To Purge the <HI REND="blackletterType">Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors:</HI> OR, A Cure for the pre&s;ent State of Phy&s;ick.</HEAD>
<P>THE State of Phy&s;ick may be truly &s;aid to be &s;ick, and &s;tand in need of the Doctor: I mean the Cor|dial Admini&s;tration of the Law, to bring it out of its Convul&s;ive Motions; for the whole Body is in &s;uch an uproar and confu&s;ion, I know not how any particu|lar Member that has a Dependence on the Welfare of the whole, &s;hould be able to perform his Functions regularly. I de&s;ign therefore to State the Ca&s;e impartially betwixt the hone&s;t Di&s;pen&s;ary Phy&s;icians (as they are pleas'd to entitle them&s;elves) on the one part; And the Apothecary's Advo|cates,
<PB N="2" REF="2">what the Apothecaries them&s;elves on the other part, and propo&s;e a Medium: To reconcile both Parties, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the Ca&s;e &s;tands thus: Several Eminent Members of the Di&s;pen&s;ary Catalogue, after many Years Diligence in hunting out Bu&s;ine&s;s, and getting little, at la&s;t found it entirely fall into the hands of the Younger Fry; began then to &s;et upon a pro&s;pect how to employ them&s;elves; for finding they had began at the wrong End fir&s;t, they thought upon the De|&s;ign of erecting a Laboratory, to in&s;truct them&s;elves a little better in the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> which, after many Years Ob|&s;ervation, they had at la&s;t pick'd up among&s;t the Apothe|caries. A happy Thought indeed! After a hundred Years Study, to hit upon the Right at la&s;t, and think upon doing &s;omething to be taken Notice of, after &s;o long a time of being remarkably Eminent for <HI>doing Nothing</HI> that tended either to the Improvement of real Knowledge, or the more effectual Curing of Di&s;ea&s;es. But now to &s;how the World the College (I mean the Di&s;pen&s;ary College) was not much of their Labour, and rather than lie idle they wou'd practi&s;e <HI>gratis,</HI> they offer'd Propo&s;als to the Apothecaries, <HI>That if they wou'd find Medicines, they wou'd be &s;o Charitable as to Pre|&s;cribe to all the Poor of the City of</HI> London. Indeed I think this was a little too hard upon the Apothecaries; for, con|&s;idering the Phy&s;icians that made tho&s;e Propo&s;als had little or nothing el&s;e to do, it was not much out of their way but the Apothecaries being to find all the Materials; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> rightly, that the&s;e Men's Bills wou'd never an&s;wer the Charge to them again, very rea&s;onably declin'd it. Well, this wou'd not do; but having erected a Laboratory, they hit upon this De&s;ign to enjoyn all the Community to &s;ub&s;cribe for a Di&s;pen&s;ary, as at fir&s;t pretended only to &s;up|ply the Poor with good Medicines at the prime Co&s;t. Tho' the Apothecaries at their fir&s;t Propo&s;al were to do it for no|thing.
e<PB N="3" REF="3">Now comes the the Di&s;&s;ention of their own Mem|bers, for the Learned part of their Body very well under|&s;tanding the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> and &s;eeing thro' the &s;hallow Pretext of &s;o mean a Fraud, to take Apothecary's Trade up|on them&s;elves, &s;traitways &s;hew their Aver&s;ion to &s;uch a poor De&s;ign, vail'd under the Specious Name of Charity; hence has ari&s;en all tho&s;e Animo&s;ities and Feuds, &s;o wittily Bur|le&s;qu'd by a Member of their own. And now to revenge this mighty Quarrel, the Authority of the College mu&s;t be exercis'd upon every one that &s;eem to di&s;countenance this Grand and Laudable De&s;ign. I &s;hall therefore here take oc|ca&s;ion to ob&s;erve how fitly qualified mo&s;t of the&s;e Worthy Sub&s;cribers were for Apothecaries? What Choice they made of Operators? And how their Medicines were at fir&s;t prepar'd. In the fir&s;t place, I wonder to hear &s;ome of the&s;e Men of late &s;et up for great Operators, and can now tell in every Coffee-hou&s;e, how <HI>Mithridate</HI> and <HI>Dia&s;cordium</HI> is com|pounded, when a few days ago they made many mode&s;t Mi&s;takes in Simple, Waters; nay in their own Laboratory, one that mounted the Guard for that day, le&s;t there &s;hould be any Minute difference in the Compo&s;ition, had like to have &s;ent for a Con&s;ultation to the Committee, to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt <HI>Liquori&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gentian.</HI> If the&s;e be the Men that are to regulate the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> to In&s;pect the Apo|thecarie's Medicines; nay to &s;et up Shops, and di&s;pence bet|ter Medicines of their own Making; ev'n the Lord have mercy upon us. I never thought the&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ary Men were really in Earne&s;t before, but that this was only done to bring the Apothecaries to &s;ome rea&s;onable Compliance, to take their Submi&s;&s;ion, and &s;end 'em to their Shops again; but this is the ready way to make 'em all for&s;ake their Shops; and Sell their blue Aprons to the Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctors. For one of the fir&s;t Operators the&s;e ingenious Men employ'd in
<PB N="4" REF="4">this great Work, was one that had been &s;ome time Prentice to an Apothecary of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle upon Tine,</HI> who there are gene|rally <HI>Grocers</HI> as well as <HI>Apothecaries;</HI> but (by the by, ob&s;erve all their Skill in Pharmacy has been learn'd from the Apothe|caries, or their Boys that in&s;tructed &s;ome of 'em, to my know|ledge) where after &s;ome Years Experience in Di&s;tilling of Mint, Camomil and Ani&s;eed Water, he is at la&s;t advanc'd to the great Tru&s;t of Prime Operator to the Di&s;pen&s;ary (always ob&s;erving he is under the Care and Management of the Com|mittee.) Now I leave you to judge, if the World mu&s;t not needs be very well &s;upplied, when I &s;hall tell you this Coun|try Booby knew not the Names, Form, or Figure of his U|ten&s;ils, much le&s;s how to u&s;e them: For by Chance I hap|pen'd to be pre&s;ent, when a grave Di&s;pen&s;ary Doctor and this Philo&s;opher by Fire, were hotly Di&s;puting which was the Head, and which the Body of a Cucurbit, and how to hit the Junctures clo&s;e; This occa&s;ion'd me (when the Ma|gi&s;terial <HI>Doctor</HI> was withdrawn) to ask &s;ome few Que&s;tions about the Preparations of &s;ome Medicines, which I imagin'd they cou'd not be without: But I &s;oon found the A&s;&s;uming Operator (who was not a little Proud of his new Title) as ignorant as his Ma&s;ter. But I fear this will give &s;o much Offence, that the&s;e Gentlemen will never think I can have that Re&s;pect for them, as to offer any thing for their Ad|vantage; but indeed they are mi&s;taken: and I think they have taken the wrong Mea&s;ures them&s;elves, either for pro|moting the Honour or Advantage of the Faculty of Phy|&s;ick; For certainly nothing can tend &s;o much to the Intere&s;t and Reputation of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> as a hearty Union among&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ors of it; and &s;uch a right Under&s;tanding among&s;t all tho&s;e that profe&s;s any part of it, that neither the <HI>Phy|&s;ician</HI> may encroach upon the Office and particular <HI>Duty</HI> of the Surgeon or Apothecary, or either of them upon the
<PB N="5" REF="5"><HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> or each other's proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, but that every one of 'em act di&s;tinctly in his own Sphere, and not endeavour to U&s;urp the <HI>Practice</HI> of one another. But in&s;tead of all this, every one of the&s;e 3 di&s;tinct Bodies have promi&s;cuou&s;ly interfer'd with each other's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o at la&s;t brought a Confu&s;ion and Controver&s;ie in the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> therefore it ought to be enquir'd into, who were the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors; And 2dly, What Remedy ought to be taken to cure this growing Evil, both to them&s;elves and the whole Nation. And fir&s;t of all, I think it highly unrea&s;onable, that the College of <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> &s;hould have any &s;uch Power in them to Cen|&s;ure and Condemn the other two Bodies of Surgery and Pharmacy; or that they &s;hould have a Power to practice all the parts of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and to vend Medicines, &s;ince there are two Bodies likewi&s;e incorporated, as well as them&s;elves, to exerci&s;e the particular Parts of Surgery and Pharmacy; For I think it the highe&s;t Inju&s;tice to make 'em a Body Politick, and afterwards re&s;train 'em to the Juri&s;diction of another, &s;ince the Incorporating of any Per&s;ons, is with De&s;ign to bring 'em under the Limitation only of their own Laws and Government: Therefore we are to enquire who were the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors. I cannot but think it was, and is always the Apothecary's Intere&s;t to call in a Phy&s;ician to the Pa|tient as &s;oon as he can; and therefore, why he &s;hould err in this, I cannot under&s;tand; be&s;ides, if it was not always his Intere&s;t, it would be his Safety, becau&s;e then the Care of the Patient lies wholly on the Phy&s;ician, and the Mi&s;|carriage ought to be imputed to him. But when the Apo|thecary meet with poor Patients, he mu&s;t either Advice him &s;omething him&s;elf, or el&s;e he mu&s;t have nothing: Becau&s;e mo&s;t of the Phy&s;icians, and e&s;pecially of late, will not take the Trouble to Pre&s;cribe and give Advice <HI>gratis,</HI> and &s;o they may thank them&s;elves. But therefore, to take off this Ob|jection,
<PB N="6" REF="6">the College &s;et up the Di&s;pen&s;ary, as a Pretence to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Poor, when, before they &s;old Medicines, it was difficult to get any of 'em upon Reque&s;t to give any Advice, without &s;uch Fees as poor People could not give; then the continual Threats, and Trouble, and Suits at Law they have put &s;everal of the Apothecaries to, is a very great Rea&s;on why the Apothecaries have been nece&s;&s;itated to make the be&s;t advantage they cou'd of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Permi&s;&s;ion the College have given to Quacks, and others that daily Vend Medicines to the great Detriment of the Apothecaries, while on the other hand, they unju&s;tly, and contrary to all Right and Rea&s;on, pro&s;ecute the Graduate Phy&s;icians of our own Univer&s;ities, upon pretence of an Act of Parliament, that ne|ver had the Royal A&s;&s;ent to it; nor can it be rea&s;onably &s;up|pos'd it &s;hou'd, &s;ince there is no re&s;pect had of the Privi|ledges of our own Univer&s;ities, which yet never was unex|cepted before. And I hope tho&s;e two Learned Bodies will take care to vindicate and a&s;&s;ert their own Rights again&s;t a Monopoly of a few Men, (I call 'em &s;o) becau&s;e the greater Part, and tho&s;e Men of the be&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s will never con&s;ent to their unrea&s;onable Proceedings. Therefore to remedy this, there is only this way left: <HI>viz.</HI> To petition the next Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament, either to explain the Acts of Parliament granted already in behalf of the Faculty, and to re&s;train all their illegal Practices, or el&s;e to grant Leave to bring in a Bill for the Regulation and better E&s;tabli&s;hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Practice of Phy&s;ick, wherein every di&s;tinct Body &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have their Priviledges free to them&s;elves, and the Exor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tances of the College Practices taken away, &s;o that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould have no Power to oppre&s;s others, nor want any Power to vindicate them&s;elves; and &s;uch Laws as &s;hould not be detrimental to the Priviledges of the Univer&s;ities And fir&s;t, That none &s;hould be permitted to be Members o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

That none of this Body &s;hould be permitted to Practi&s;e Surgery, or Compound, or Sell Medicines, nor Pra|cti&s;e Man-Midwifry. That the Surgeons be govern'd by their own Laws, and not &s;ubject to the College, nor be permitted to give any Phy&s;ick inwardly, except the <HI>Pox</HI> alone, but that they buy all their Medicines of the Apo|thecaries; and that &s;evere Penalties be inflicted on 'em for doing the contrary. That the Apothecaries &s;hall not ad|mini&s;ter Phy&s;ick inwardly or outwardly by Bills, as a Phy|&s;ician, or Practi&s;e any Part of Surgery, but that all Medi|cines be rated by the Laws of their own Corporation, and Tables hung up in every Shop; and that they be no ways Subject to the Phy&s;icians or Surgeons, but act &s;eparately by them&s;elves.</P>
