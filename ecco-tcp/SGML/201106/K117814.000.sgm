<HEAD>ANALYSIS OF <HI>BELLOSTE</HI>'s PILLS, AND THEIR Manner of operating in the Human Body, by the Author him&s;elf; with full DIRECTIONS for U&s;ing of this Remedy.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is a Thing univer&s;ally known, that <HI>England</HI> has, of old, been the Nur&s;ery of Men of Learn|ing, and that &s;he is &s;till, this very Day, the Mother of Arts and Sciences; and among&s;t tho&s;e that this flouri&s;hing Kingdom has cultivated with an inimi|table Care, Phy&s;ick is placed in the fir&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="2">Rank. It is to the celebrated Profe&s;&s;ors of the&s;e famous Univer&s;ities, as well as to the Knowledge and Experience of the excellent Practitioners of this Country, that it owes its fine&s;t Lu&s;tre: Therefore all the World ought to pre&s;erve a re&s;pect|ful and grateful Memory for tho&s;e great Men who have publi&s;h'd &s;o many learned Works, and have made Di&s;coveries upon the human Body of a prodigious Utility for the Pre&s;ervation of Mankind, and the Cure of the Sick.</P>
<P>Yet one cannot deny that there has been, in foreign Countries, con&s;ummated Prac|titioners, who having exerci&s;ed their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, during a great Number of Years, and who having had favourable Oppor|tunities of employing the happy Talents which Providence had be&s;tow'd upon them, with a &s;ound Judgment and par|ticular Lights, have, upon a long Expe|rience, made Di&s;coveries, and found out Remedies unknown to the preceding Ages; whereby the Glory they have ac|quired by their Art, is not le&s;s con&s;ider|able than the infinite Service done to the Publick by their Studies, and indefati|gable A&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>I think I may be allow'd to &s;peak par|ticularly on this Subject, as being the Son
<PB N="3" REF="3">of a Father &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Sur|gery, by a &s;ucce&s;sful Practice of Sixty Years, which made him worthy of the mo&s;t eminent Employments, that a Man of his Profe&s;&s;ion could a&s;pire to, and who&s;e Writings are tran&s;lated into mo&s;t of the Languages of <HI>Europe;</HI> who hav|ing found out the &s;alutary Effects that <HI>Mercury</HI> produceth in the Human Body, &s;pent three Quarter Parts of his Life in di&s;covering the &s;afe&s;t Manner of taking it &s;ucce&s;sfully, and without the Danger of any Accident, be it ever &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>He has been &s;o lucky in his Search, that he has performed with this Mineral a va&s;t Number of Cures, mo&s;t of them of a different Nature, which, in the Be|ginning, have even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his Expecta|tion; and he has ob&s;erv'd, that all the&s;e good Effects could be attained only by crude <HI>Mercury,</HI> being fir&s;t very well clean&s;ed of all its terre&s;tial and ar&s;enical Parts whereof it is loaded, coming from the Mine, ty'd by a Curb that hinders it from &s;ublimating, and mix'd only with gentle and &s;uitable Purgatives, without any Preparation by Fire, which is always very dangerous, as he has judiciou&s;ly ex|pre&s;s'd it in his &s;econd Volume.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>He has had the mo&s;t favourable Op|portunities to try it, having been, for a long Time, Surgeon Major of the Ho&s;|pitals of the <HI>French</HI> King's Army in <HI>Italy,</HI> and afterwards fir&s;t Surgeon to Madam Royal at <HI>Turin,</HI> during twenty-&s;ix Years, till that Prince&s;s died; where he has made, with the <HI>Mercury</HI> thus prepared, &s;everal Cures, which have been admired by all the Court; and where his Per|&s;on, and what he did, will not &s;oon be forgotten.</P>
<P>He was &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied that <HI>Mer|cury</HI> (whereof he alone has found the true Preparation) is a rare Gift of Pro|vidence, capable to obviate &s;o many dif|ferent Di&s;tempers; &s;ince (in the Manner he gives it) it has the principal Quali|fications required for curing all the Di&s;|orders occa&s;ioned by the bad Con&s;titution of the Blood, which are to evacuate &s;u|perfluous and peccant Humours, to ab&s;orbe the Sharpne&s;s of the Blood, and of the Humours, and to di&s;&s;olve the Thickne&s;s thereof. It tempers be&s;ides the Ferments of the Stomach, when they are in a manner viciated, and puts them again in a Condi|tion to make a good and perfect Dige&s;tion, which is the Spring of Life and Health; and, on the contrary, when it is adulte|rated,
<PB N="5" REF="5">it is the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of mo&s;t Di&s;tem|pers that attack the Human Bodies.</P>
<P>In effect, when this vital Function comes to be di&s;ordered by the Mi&s;u&s;age that is made of Food, which is the mo&s;t common, How many Di&s;ea&s;es is it not &s;ubject to breed? When there can only re&s;ult, from the Concoction of bad Ail|ments, a &s;harp or vi&s;cous Chylus, and &s;ometimes both, which can only produce a Blood of the like or &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>From the Thickne&s;s of the Blood and of the Humours, comes a great Number of Infirmities; as the Ob&s;tructions in the Entrails and the Kernels, a Slowne&s;s in the Circulation; from thence the Re|tardment, and &s;ometimes the Stoppage of the Secretions, and of the Di&s;tribu|tions of the nutricious and other nece&s;&s;ary Juices, for the Pre&s;ervation of the animal Oeconomy.</P>
<P>Their Sharpne&s;s is not le&s;s dangerous, as being very often the Occa&s;ion of the Di&s;orders above-mention'd, and the Cau&s;e of Overflowings, and the Thickenings of the Lymph in the different Parts of the Body, the Irritations of the Nerves, and the Contractions of the Fibres.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Cau&s;es, well con&s;ider'd, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that from them pro|ceed
<PB N="6" REF="6">mo&s;t of the Di&s;orders that afflict Human Body; as the Tumours in the Liver, the overflowing of the Choler in the Surface of the Body, or its &s;pilling in the Ventricle; the Ob&s;tructions of the Kernels in the Me&s;entery, or in Womens Brea&s;ts, Schirrus or Cancers, Oppilations, Green-&s;ickne&s;s, &s;topping of the Cour&s;es, hy&s;terical Vapours, &s;pilling of Milk in Women after their Lyings-in, Pains in the Head, Swimmings in the &s;ame, Me|grim, Scurvy, Fevers, St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fire, Surfeits, Con&s;umption, Oppre&s;&s;ions in the Brea&s;t, and Shortne&s;s of Breath, Sciatica, Rheumati&s;m, the Gout, the Griping of the Guts, Nephretick Cholick, the Gra|vel, the Strangury, the Hypochondriac Di&s;ea&s;e or Melancholy; as likewi&s;e, the King's Evil.</P>
<P>All this, at fir&s;t Sight, &s;eems to be a Paradox; yet every thing rightly con&s;i|dered, and weighed with Judgment, and without Prejudice, it &s;hall plainly be found, that one and the &s;ame Cau&s;e pro|duces many different Effects, if it be ob|&s;erv'd, that all the&s;e Di&s;tempers are oc|ca&s;ion'd by the Sharpne&s;s or the Vi&s;co&s;ity of the Humours, which &s;lide into diffe|rent Parts of the Body, as they find them di&s;po&s;ed to receive them.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>The Worms, to which Children more particularly are very &s;ubject, by the ill U&s;e that one allows them to make of Fruit and Sweat-Meats: There peri&s;hes a pro|digious Number of the&s;e innocent Crea|tures, by Cau&s;es very often unknown, and for want of giving them the proper Reme|dies to de&s;troy tho&s;e dangerous In&s;ects.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Di&s;orders which the De|pravation and the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Age have render'd too common, produc'd by a Ferment, which is extraneous, &s;harp and malignant, and on which, tho' there be much to be &s;aid, I chu&s;e to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As my Father has labour'd all his Life for the publick Good, in the fir&s;t Volume of his Book, intitled, <HI>The Ho&s;pital Sur|geon;</HI> he has given a &s;hort and ea&s;y Me|thod of Curing, in a &s;hort Time, all Sorts of Wounds: In the &s;econd Volume, he has mechanically explain'd the Virtues of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and its Manner of operating on the Ma&s;s of Blood in the Human Bodies. Tho&s;e that &s;hall think fit to read it, they &s;hall find an Account of a Di&s;temper of each Specie of tho&s;e that he cured with this Remedy. The Learned and the Cu|rious may have Recour&s;e to it; my In|tention being only to give an Idea or a general Notion of the Effect which this
<PB N="8" REF="8">Remedy produces, to tho&s;e that are not at hand for to provide them&s;elves with the &s;aid Book, or who will not give them&s;elves the Trouble of reading an en|tire Volume.</P>
<P>This Remedy ought not to be con&s;ider'd &s;eparately, neither as a &s;ingle Purgative, &s;oft and gentle, nor &s;ingly, as a Mineral Liquid, and penetrating; but as a &s;peci|fick Remedy compounded of both, in a Manner which renders it almo&s;t univer&s;al, &s;ince it perfectly tempers the bad Quality of the Blood, and of the Lymph, and that it evacuates without Trouble or Al|teration, the &s;uperfluous and peccant Hu|mours by the u&s;ual Ways of Nature.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the Roundne&s;s of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and its Activity, are the two main Qualities that we are to con&s;ider in the Effect which it produces on the Ma&s;s of Humours, &s;ince its Weight is only of &s;ome Con&s;equence, when it is united in a certain Volume, as it is given in the Twi&s;ting of the Guts.</P>
<P>When it comes then to di&s;&s;olve in the Stomach, the mo&s;t volatile Part of <HI>Mer|cury</HI> that &s;eparates by Means of the Fer|ments and the Heat of the Stomach, &s;lips, with the Chylus, into the lacteal Veins, that are carried together, and by
<PB N="9" REF="9">the &s;ame Way into the Ma&s;s of the Blood; there, by its Roundne&s;s, and its natural Motion, which is augmented by the Vi|bration of the Arteries, it circulates into the Blood and lymphatick Ve&s;&s;els, di|viding it &s;elf, as we conceive it, into in|finite &s;mall Parts, it runs through all the capillary Veins: If it meets in its Way any Ob&s;tacle in the Glands or Entrails, it &s;trikes and beats again&s;t it, it loo&s;ens Part of it, until at la&s;t, by often repeating the &s;ame Action, it makes it &s;elf a free Pa&s;|&s;age, and thereby procures to the Hu|mours a clear Way, which, to them, for a long Time, was become impracticable: By its continual and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Rubbings, it blunts the Points and Edges of the Acids that it meets with, it wa&s;tes and divides them, it drags and hurries them out of the Body, partly by Tran&s;piration, by Urine, and by Stools, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the proper Purgatives, fit to di&s;&s;olve and eva|cuate the &s;limy and ropy Matters, and all extraneous Bodies out of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, apt to breed various Di&s;tempers, which, though &s;light and in&s;ignificant in their Beginning, are &s;ometimes of a very dangerous Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Thus it is that I have often &s;een Per|&s;ons cured which were afflicted with in|veterate
<PB N="10" REF="10">Ob&s;tructions in the Entrails of the lower Belly, and in the Me&s;enterick Glands, which were become &s;chirrous, and which permitted the Pa&s;&s;age only to the Part of the Chylus, the mo&s;t wateri&s;h and le&s;s nouri&s;hing; and the Blood not receiving &s;ufficient Reparation, in pro|portion to the Lo&s;&s;es it makes by the Tran&s;piration, the Urine, and other Eva|cuations, there had en&s;ued a total Lean|ne&s;s in the Body, which evidently tended to a Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>It is after the &s;ame manner of operating that this Medicine has often cured old Ulcers, Tetters over all the Body, hy&s;te|rical Convul&s;ions, with &s;eventeen Relap&s;es in a Day, old Stoppages of the Cour&s;es, &s;pilling of Milk after Delivery, which had obliged the Woman to keep her Bed for Eight Years, Loo&s;ene&s;s and Di&s;enteries, Gripings of the Guts, Nephretick Cho|licks, with Lo&s;s of Blood by Urine, Hypo|chondriack Di&s;ea&s;es three Years old, Gouts, Rheumati&s;ms all over the Body, and ve|nereal Di&s;tempers &s;o old and ob&s;tinate, as to have re&s;i&s;ted all the other u&s;ual Reme|dies: The&s;e are Cures publickly known, which have been performed in <HI>France</HI> by the Help of my Pills, even with the Know|ledge of the Phy&s;icians of the Court.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that when the&s;e Sorts of Di&s;tempers are new, they are cured with an admirable Quickne&s;s and Facility; but when they are of an old Date, and inveterate, one mu&s;t not flatter one's &s;elf; they cannot be cured but by a long Cour&s;e of Phy&s;ick, more or le&s;s, according to the Age and the Con&s;titution of the Patient, who, rather than to di&s;|continue, ought to go on with a very moderate Do&s;e, which purging him only three Times, or thereabouts, may not give him any Trouble, or di&s;courage him, the Di&s;temper, at la&s;t, will be conquer'd: For it is ridiculous and ab&s;urd, to imagine that one Do&s;e or two of any Phy&s;ick what|&s;oever, may cure a Chronical Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>How can one expect to render, in a &s;hort Time, fluid, a thick and vi&s;cous Blood, to di&s;&s;ipate old Tumours, to melt inveterate Ob&s;tructions, to render bal|&s;amick &s;harp Humours, to re&s;tore the animal Secretions, return to the Fibres their natural Springine&s;s; in &s;hort, to re|&s;tore all the Parts of the Body in a per|fect State of Health? Which can only be performed by a good Di&s;&s;olvant and Ab&s;orbent, taken in a &s;uitable Do&s;e, du|ring a &s;ufficient Time, for to fulfil the&s;e Indications.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="12">
<P>It only belongs to <HI>Quacks</HI> to promi&s;e very &s;peedy Cures; and therefore the Succe&s;s never, or &s;eldom an&s;wers; that is, the right Name and Character of tho&s;e Impo&s;tors, who, by dint of Untruths, gather Riches, deceiving the ea&s;y Cre|dulity of an ignorant Publick, &s;o far as to fal&s;ify good Remedies, and to &s;ell them under the Name of the true Author: So that one cannot take Precaution enough in making u&s;e of Remedies, and e&s;pe|cially &s;pecifick ones; one ought to get them from the Author him&s;elf, or from Per&s;ons of Probity, who are in Corre&s;pon|dence with him.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that &s;hall make U&s;e of this Re|medy, &s;hall find by Experience, that in|&s;en&s;ibly it expels out of the Body all that is foul, malignant, and extraneous, and that it averts the Infirmities of Old Age.</P>
<P>It is by that Means that my Father has lived above eighty Years, without feeling tho&s;e Ailments to which one is &s;ubject at that Age: But, at la&s;t being dead, if he could not leave me his Learning, and his happy Talents, he has made me the Heir of his Secret, of his Hone&s;ty, and of his unalterable Uprightne&s;s, as well as an invincible Hatred for Fraud and Fal&s;|hood.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
<P>The whole Do&s;e, which is one Pill, is not to &s;erve for a Rule to every Body; for it mu&s;t be alter'd and proportion'd to the Age, and to the Con&s;titution of the Patient, as well as to the Effect it pro|duces: For an In&s;tance; if it purges four or five Times, it is enough; if eight or ten times, it mu&s;t be le&s;&s;en'd one Quar|ter, one third Part, or one Half; and if it purges only two or three Times, and but little at a Time, then the Do&s;e mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in Proportion: Yet, if it &s;hould &s;ometimes happen in lu&s;ty Per&s;ons, full of gro&s;s Humours, that a common Do&s;e &s;hould occa&s;ion a plentiful Evacua|tion, one mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged; for then, the more the Phy&s;ick operates, the more one feels the Illne&s;s decrea&s;ing, and one's Strength augmenting. But as there are likewi&s;e &s;ome Con&s;titutions, the Hu|mours whereof are difficult to be evacua|ted, and that even one Do&s;e and a half purges them but little, the Patient then mu&s;t take a Gli&s;ter the Day of a &s;econd taking, or the Day following; it &s;oftens the vi&s;cous and clammy Humours, it loo&s;ens the Fibres of the Inte&s;tines, and empties what has been put in Motion by the Pills; and it is very proper to make U&s;e, now and then, of &s;uch a Remedy.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14">
<P>In Ca&s;es of extraordinary Cholick, as the Twi&s;ting of the Guts, the Do&s;e mu&s;t be doubled, and even trebled; but in this la&s;t Ca&s;e, if the Inte&s;tine &s;hould be fallen into the Scrotum, the taking of the Pills mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended, until it be reduced again into the Abdomen.</P>
<P>If the Gout be newly come, or ju&s;t growing upon one, it radically cures it: But if it be of a long Standing, it puts off the Fit, and le&s;&s;ens the Violence of the Pains.</P>
<P>As this Remedy is very &s;afe in its Ope|ration, it is given with Succe&s;s, and with|out the lea&s;t Danger to Child-bearing Women, and to Nur&s;es, in a moderate Do&s;e; for it increa&s;es and cools their Milk.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons that u&s;e to take a Purge by Precaution, will be entirely &s;atisfied with the Effect of this Remedy; for it evacuates the Flegm and the Choler to Admiration, without Pains, Gripes, or any Alterations; it creates an Appetite, and promotes Sleep.</P>
<P>A Proof that it is no violent Medicine is, that it has cured Children under a Twelve-month old, of a Fever, cau&s;ed by bad Food, and Convul&s;ions, occa&s;ion'd by the Worms; ob&s;erving to give them
<PB N="15" REF="15">only a little Do&s;e proportion'd to their Age, divided into &s;mall Parts, that they may &s;wallow it in Lumps or Grains, without being di&s;&s;olv'd before taking (for the Di&s;&s;olution of this Phy&s;ick mu&s;t ab|&s;olutely be made in the Stomach) and to that Purpo&s;e one may wrap the Pills into Wafer-Paper, roa&s;ted Apples, Sweet-Meats, or the like.</P>
<P>They are taken every other Night, two or three Hours after a very light Supper, with Mutton-Broath, Water-Gruel, or Tea, as hot as one can drink it. The next Day one may take again &s;ome &s;uch hot Liquid, in order to help the Opera|tion of the Medicine. It al&s;o may be taken in the Morning fa&s;ting, which is better than at Night.</P>
<P>One is not obliged to keep in Bed nor the Chamber, nor to ob&s;erve a very rigo|rous Diet; but only to take Care not to catch Cold; to forbear all Acids, unripe Fruit, all Things made of Milk, Pork Fle&s;h, and &s;alt Meat.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pills will never &s;poil, if kept in a Box, in a temperate Place.</P>
<P>They are to be Sold only at Mrs. <HI>Clocker</HI>'s, a Packer, at the <HI>Blue Flower-Pot,</HI> in <HI>Great Bell Alley, Coleman-&s;treet,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="16" MS="y">and at Mrs. <HI>Giles's,</HI> a <HI>Milliner,</HI> at the <HI>Blue Ball</HI> near the <HI>Temple-Gate</HI> in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> at twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Box with eight Do&s;es, or ten Shillings the half Box with four Do&s;es, with the&s;e Directions.</P>
