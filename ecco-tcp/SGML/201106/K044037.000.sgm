<HEAD>ON THE EXTRACT OF LEAD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my intention here to de&s;cant on the prai&s;es of Mr. Goulard's remedy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Goulard's work, &s;old by P. Elm&s;ly &s;ucce&s;|&s;or to Mr. Vaillant, Book&s;eller in the Strand.</NOTE> That is already too well known throughout Europe, to want any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from my pen. My views coincide entirely with tho&s;e of the author, in endeavouring to bring it to &s;till greater perfection, by con&s;idering it with more preci&s;ene&s;s both as to it's compo&s;ition and u&s;e. To be ignorant of the&s;e would be a fault, willingly to conceal it's &s;uperior virtues, would be an injury to &s;ociety, and a mannes of proceeding very different from the author's, who has publi&s;hed all his knowledge on the &s;ubject without re&s;erve.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y">
<P>This medicament, ju&s;tly looked upon by tho&s;e of the faculty, who are free from prejudice, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al topic in &s;urgery, may very properly be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of all others generally pre&s;cribed: it will frequently prove efficacious when the re&s;t have failed, and will repair the di&s;orders they have brought upon the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I don't pretend to mention this medicine as a new di&s;covered one, on the contrary, we have received it from antiquity, known by the name of <HI>Acetum Lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">argiri;</HI> but by its having been ill made, <HI>mal-a-propos</HI> applied, and pre&s;cribed in improper quantities, it was for &s;ome time out of repute, and with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and the vigilance of Mr. Goulard's &s;peculative turn, who has had re|&s;olution enough to &s;tem the torrent of oppo&s;i|tion, this remedy, like many others, by having been improperly made and as improperly ad|mini&s;tred, would have fallen into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion only of the quacks. For want of proper vinegar the ba&s;is of this medicine it frequent|ly deceived the practitioners, who, from not knowing its properties and the real method of compo&s;ing it, entirely laid it a&s;ide. But it has of late been too minutely con&s;idered to be any longer neglected, and is now looked upon, by the impartial part of mankind, to be one of the greate&s;t ornaments of the di&s;|pen&s;atories, as well as the mo&s;t efficacious re|medy in &s;urgery. It is then to Mr. Goulard, a
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">&s;kilful &s;urgeon of Montpellier, we owe its re|vival; which could never have been effected, but by a man of his eminence, and like him ex|empt from vulgar prejudice, which has hither|to laid to the charge of this &s;alutary remedy faults, from which the experiments of many famous in their profe&s;&s;ion are now endeavour|ing to clear it in favour of mankind.</P>
<P>When this extract is made with natural vinegar, and the &s;tronge&s;t which can be pro|cured in the &s;outh of France, where nature in favourable years, and in particular can|tons, furni&s;hes this vegetable liquor with more virtues, than any art of the vinegar|makers can po&s;&s;ibly endow it with, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the di&s;per&s;ing, cooling, and re&s;olving qualities proper for dividing the glutinous &s;tagnated matter in the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els; it relaxes them when too much contracted, and re&s;tores to the &s;olids and fluids the proportion of circulation nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the animal oeconomy in a &s;tate of health. The common vinegars, owing their &s;trength to &s;al armoniac, to pepper, and the dung of the feathered kind, which can't fail of robbing this extract of the qualities ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its perfection, as do likewi&s;e other factitious vegetable acids, &s;uch for example, as are brewed in England, and in the nor|thern countries, under the appearance of vine|gar. The latter, 'tis true, tho' not capable of injuring the con&s;titution, act as &s;timula|tors to the &s;tomach; but this property is not
<PB N="6" REF="5">&s;ufficient to perfectly di&s;&s;olve the lead, or to impregnate the&s;e metallic particles with the particular qualities they acquire by the ad|dition of tartar natural to tho&s;e vinegars, which are made with the &s;tronge&s;t wines.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Such as are well ver&s;ed in the art of chymi&s;try, know, that natural vinegar contains an e&s;&s;ential oil which entirely di&s;&s;olves lead, while its acid only divides it's parts. Mr. Goulard has di&s;covered that it is the pro|perty of &s;ome particular vinegars only of the province he lives in, to perfectly di&s;&s;olve this metal, as they con|tain more e&s;&s;ential oil than the re&s;t; con&s;equently natu|ral vinegars, when adulterated, or factitious one, which receive their power of action from the acrid ingredients only mixed with them, are not only rendered incapable of perfectly di&s;&s;olving the lead, but likewi&s;e com|municate an inflammatory quality to the extract, very different from the cooling and calming one natural to it, when made with the be&s;t vinegar. The healing quality of lead is evident, from its happy effects, when applied in its natural &s;tate even to ulcerated cancers; how much more efficaciou&s;ly mu&s;t it then act, when its &s;aline particles are &s;o far divided as to be capable of being introduced into the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, and there circulate with the juices? the&s;e they attenuate and divide, &s;o as to return into their proper channel; it is very nece&s;|&s;ary then, that the vinegar; made u&s;e of for the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the lead, &s;hould be natural, well cho&s;en, and by no means factitious. A chymical analy&s;is will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the defects of vinegar; but, as every one is not in a &s;ituation of making the&s;e experiments, it's merits may be a&s;certained by the ta&s;te only. Good vinegar, when touched with the tongue, has a plea&s;ing acid ta&s;te, and leaves a fre&s;hne&s;s in the mouth, but when factitious rather appears to inflame the mouth, and throat, which &s;en&s;ation continues for &s;ome time.</NOTE> I &s;hall not here enter upon the bad qualities which may be conveyed to lead by the in|gredients
<PB N="7" REF="6">made u&s;e of in the compo&s;ition of factitious vinegars, which are brewed ac|cording to every one's particular <HI>recipe.</HI> The be&s;t argument in favor of the extract of Saturn, made in particular parts of the &s;outh of France, and again&s;t any other extract made with common vinegars, is, that the tartar of Languedoc has the preference in chymical proce&s;&s;es, &s;ome of which are in vain attempted without it. Another argument &s;till more cor|roborative is that, at Montpellier alone good verdigrea&s;e can be procured, on account of the &s;ingular property of its vinegar, and for &s;ome other concurrent and unknown rea&s;ons, which help to di&s;&s;olve the copper the ba&s;is of the above drug. For the &s;ame rea&s;on we may be induced to think that the tartarous particles of the wine of that country, being refined by its change into vinegar, may contribute more efficaciou&s;ly to di&s;&s;olve the lead, which experi|ence daily proves. Common vinegars help only to divide it in parts, &s;ome of Languedoc pro|perly elected di&s;&s;olve it &s;o thoroughly, that without any &s;ediment it pre&s;erves its weight, a certain proof that it incorporates it&s;elf more with this &s;pecies of vinegar, which no doubt mu&s;t render it's effects more efficacious. It is certainly owing to this, that the medicine we &s;peak of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es cooling, di&s;per&s;ing, re|&s;olving qualities, and by no means a repelling one, as has been hinted by certain people. This requires an explanation, which will be
<PB N="8" REF="7">ea&s;ily under&s;tood by the meane&s;t capacity, as I &s;hall endeavour to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the plaine&s;t terms.</P>
<P>When the lead is divided only, it's parts are too gro&s;s and ponderous to remain &s;u&s;|pended in the vegetable liquid its vehicle; this cau&s;es it to &s;ub&s;ide: on &s;haking the bottle, they again incorporate with the liquid, with|out &s;uffering a diminution of their volume; this volume by preventing them from penetrat|ing to the ve&s;&s;els tho' the pores of the &s;kin cau&s;es them to remain in the ti&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e parts, and, by &s;topping up the pa&s;&s;ages of per&s;pirati|on, gives ri&s;e to what is generally termed re|pul&s;ion. But, when the metal is &s;o far di&s;&s;olved, as always to remain &s;u&s;pended in the vegetable liquid, its parts are &s;o fine and &s;o far attenuat|ed, as not to be di&s;cernable thro' the mo&s;t per|fect micro&s;cope; they then ea&s;ily penetrate the pores of the &s;kin, follow the cour&s;e of the per&s;piratory ve&s;&s;els, and put in motion the in&s;pi&s;&s;ated and &s;tagnated fluids, which they again return to the road of circulation. When the metallic particles act thus, the aquatic vehicles, with which they are combined, loo&s;en the &s;kin, which was before in a &s;tate of too great ten&s;ion, whil&s;t the &s;piritous ones re|&s;tore to the ve&s;&s;els that ela&s;ticity of which they had been deprived. Thus a re&s;olution of the hu|mours is effected by means of tran&s;piration and circulation: but a wi&s;e and cautious prac|titioner mu&s;t always attend to the progre&s;s of
<PB N="9" REF="8">the complaint, when either putrefaction or a degree of malignity is apprehended; and care &s;hould be always taken to mix this with dige&s;|tives, for critical di&s;charges, as by abating their heat it will prevent the neighbouring parts from being affected, and &s;ecure the patient again&s;t a too copious di&s;charge which fre|quently attends the&s;e ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The compari&s;on made between the ex|tract of Saturn, and its &s;alt, commonly called the &s;ugar of lead, will be found unju&s;t, when we con&s;ider, that the latter is made with vinegars of all &s;orts of wines, and that tho&s;e of Switzerland, which produce the greate&s;t quantity of this &s;ugar, are made of wines very little impregnated with tartar, and that too of an inferior quality. But after all, this very &s;ugar of lead, which is quoted as a proof of the repelling quality to be found in our medicine, is it not made u&s;e of by the able&s;t practitioners, both as an internal and external medicine? if &s;o, with how much more confidence may we make u&s;e of Mr. Goulard's extract, properly made, in the above circum|&s;tances? A practice of fifty years, has &s;uf|ficiently convinced me of its &s;uperiority over the &s;ugar of lead, which I have known fail, when the other has always an&s;wered my in|tentions.</P>
<P>Such, as are thus di&s;po&s;ed to critici&s;e the mo&s;t approved remedies, won't give them&s;elves time to reflect, that an accidental failure of
<PB N="10" REF="9">&s;ucce&s;s might be owing to this extract not having been properly made in its commence|ment, or &s;ucceeding proce&s;&s;es, to its having been given in too great a quantity, or ap|plied cold, as indeed the author &s;ometimes recommends with a view only to the tempe|rate climate he writes in: thus have the&s;e people been induced, without having any regard for them&s;elves, to confirm the opinion of the vulgar, who generally attribute the death of the patient to the la&s;t remedy, and thus &s;hamefully take advantage of this fal|lacious argument to cry down the good effects of the extract of Saturn, and to extol reme|dies at be&s;t uncertain, often fallacious, and which cu&s;tom alone, the tyrant of the mind, authori&s;es the u&s;e of both again&s;t rea&s;on and experience. Many examples might be brought to refute what per&s;ons, otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable, have thought proper to advance to the pre|judice of this remedy; but I will refer the reader, to many ob&s;ervations given by the author in his treati&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Already mentioned in the note p. 3.</NOTE>, and to take into con|&s;ideration here the fir&s;t paragraph of the third Formula, page 208, on the inefficacy of the poultices generally pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The proofs I have given of the nece&s;&s;ity of procuring the be&s;t vinegar, and the rules I &s;hall lay down in the &s;equel, for the better making and u&s;ing this extract, having been
<PB N="11" REF="10">approved of by men of knowledge and rank in this country, ever intent on means to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poorer part of mankind, have induced me to procure a quantity of it from the foun|tain head it&s;elf. I have applied to Mr. Goulard for this purpo&s;e, to whom I have likewi&s;e communicated my thoughts on the farther improvement and u&s;e of this remedy, which I have the &s;atisfaction to know entirely coincide with his. This concurrence of Ideas, which originally &s;prung from a fifty years ac|quaintance, having been fellow-&s;tudents to|gether, has induced me to imitate him on other occa&s;ions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 8 and 201 of my treati&s;e of di&s;orders of the urethra and bladder, &s;old by P. Elm&s;ly, book&s;eller in the Strand, in 12mo. the third edition.</NOTE> and has been the means of his allowing me to be the &s;ole vender in this country of the extract he him&s;elf made<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the end of the&s;e remarks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This topic, which properly &s;peaking is an univer&s;al chirurgical medicine and ea&s;ily pro|cured, has this triple advantage over others. Fir&s;t, it co&s;ts but little; &s;econdly, it is pre|pared in an in&s;tant; and thirdly, it may ea&s;ily be conveyed from place to place.</P>
<P>Whoever is provided with it may prevent the bad con&s;equences of brui&s;es occa&s;ioned either by a fall or blow; it prevents an echymo&s;is, or extrava&s;ation of blood, the general attendant of fractures and di&s;locations,
<PB N="12" REF="11">till proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be procured to dre&s;s the patient <HI>&s;ecundum artem;</HI> in the&s;e circum|&s;tances it &s;hould be made u&s;e of in the begin|ning, as it is a known remedy again&s;t inflam|mations and mortifications, the general atten|dants of the&s;e complaints. I &s;hall not enter into a detail of the other di&s;orders it will relieve, but &s;hall refer the reader to Mr. Goulard's treati&s;e; I &s;hall only lay down here &s;ome few rules for its u&s;e, drawn from experience, which have met with Mr. Goulard's appro|bation, both as to that and its compo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">I.

<P N="2">II. The external qualities, which charac|terize the true original extract of Saturn, con&s;i&s;t in its colour, its &s;mell, its weight, its con&s;i&s;tence, and its ta&s;te: its colour is that of orange, its con&s;i&s;tence a little &s;irupy, its &s;mell empyreumatical, or of burnt &s;ugar, its weight a third part more than that of the vinegar; &s;o that a phial, which holds three ounces of vinegar, ought to weigh at lea&s;t four ounces when filled with the extract; the
<PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y">thickne&s;s of this medicine may be as great a defect as its lightne&s;s: for, if it weighs more or le&s;s than it ought, it cannot but deceive in regard to the proportions made u&s;e of, and not an&s;wer to the directions given. See p. 8.</P>
<P N="3">III. When bad vinegar has imbibed as much lead as it can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;&s;olve, the &s;uper|fluous metallic particles are ob&s;erved to &s;ink to the bottom of the bottle, &s;uch extract, im|properly called &s;o, is but an imperfect divi&s;ion of the lead, which mu&s;t be rejected for the rea&s;ons mentioned in page 8.</P>
<P N="4">IV. From this mixture of lead and vine|gar is produced a water called by the author vegeto-mineral; and this water is endowed with excellent virtues, when made u&s;e of in lotions, fomentations, injections, and baths, and in the different formulae de&s;cribed by Mr. Goulard, in his cerate, poultices, po|matums, liniments, plai&s;ters, &amp;c. but the water, of which the vegeto-mineral is com|po&s;ed, ought to be particularly con&s;idered in its own natural &s;tate, before it is made u&s;e of to form this medicated water. Every &s;pecies of water is not proper for this u&s;e. Rain water, when purged and filtered, and that of rivers, who&s;e bottoms con&s;i&s;t of either &s;and or gravel free from mud, are to have the preference, e&s;pecially after having been purified either by &s;tanding &s;ome time, or filtering through proper paper; &s;pring and pump water being impreg|nated
<PB N="15" REF="14">with gyp&s;ous or &s;elenitous particles, give ri&s;e to a new change of the metallic ones of the lead; and thus a white precipitate is formed, which will by no means incorporate with the water. "The&s;e effects, &s;ays a clebrated chy|mi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">BEAUME'.</NOTE>, are owing to a &s;eparation of the vitriolic acid of the &s;elenites from the earth, to which it was joined, which now mixes with the lead of the extract of Saturn, and thus forms a vitriol of lead. In that in&s;tant the vinegar mixes with the earth of the &s;elenites, and they form together an aceto&s;e-calcarious &s;alt; &s;o that at the &s;ame time a new di&s;&s;olution and a new combination are effected. Thus the medicine is by no means that of the vegeto-mineral water, but a mixture of vitriol of lead, aceto&s;e &s;alt, and brandy. On this occa&s;ion the vitriol of lead &s;eems to de&s;cend in form of a white powder, tho' it is in reality a &s;aline matter di&s;&s;oluble in water; the rea&s;on is, that it can|not be di&s;&s;olved without difficulty, and that there is not a &s;ufficiency of water to di&s;&s;olve the whole quantity collected: the remainder of the water contains in di&s;&s;olution a &s;mall quantity of this vitriol of lead. In fine, if you add to the precipitate a large quantity of boiling water, the di&s;&s;olution is perfect; which proves, that this precipitate is a &s;aline &s;ub|&s;tance." From this argument, founded on
<PB N="16" REF="15">natural philo&s;ophy, and confirmed by the experiments of all who make u&s;e of water not properly purified, may we not conclude that we have no rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed that this remedy has &s;ometimes baffled our endea|vours? is it not, on the contrary, a &s;ubject of a&s;toni&s;hment, that notwith&s;tanding this ac|cidental defect in its compo&s;ition it has &s;o frequently been crowned with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s? In fine, the water, which di&s;&s;olves &s;oap the mo&s;t effectually, is to be preferred, tho' it will be proper fir&s;t to purify it well. When the extract is thrown into improper water, it whitens it only for a time, and then falls to the bottom, without being able to mix per|fectly with it afre&s;h; this water becomes curdled, and like &s;our milk; and in this &s;tate it is by no means to be made u&s;e of, as not at all likely to an&s;wer our expectations. To this we may a&s;cribe the want of &s;ucce&s;s, which &s;erves to prejudice many again&s;t the remedy, and to plea&s;e others, who are by no means its friends for want of being better acquainted with it. When proper water cannot be pro|cured, care mu&s;t be taken to di&s;til others, if opportunity &s;erves. This may be ea&s;ily done with the common alembic, taking care to throw away &s;ome pints of the fir&s;t di&s;tilled, as it is frequently liable to be foul, by the uncleane&s;s of the head of the &s;till: you mu&s;t likewi&s;e take care to leave about a quarter of it in the &s;till, before you have fini&s;hed
<PB N="17" REF="16">your proce&s;s, to prevent the ri&s;ing of any of its heterogeneous particles. But in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, where proper water is not to be had, any kind of water may be u&s;ed, taking care to boil and filter it thro' paper which is not &s;tiffened, till &s;ome of the be&s;t water can be procured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It is advi&s;eable, that all tho&s;e, who make u&s;e of water in common as their drink, would carefully ab&s;tain from all that are hard, earthy, and &s;elenitous, which, are apt to di&s;order the &s;tomach, and give ri&s;e to &s;trong concretions in the kidneys and other urinary pa&s;&s;ages, e&s;pecially if they meet with any &s;limy matter. The on|ly means of preventing this is by di&s;tillation, which will &s;eparate, even from the pure&s;t water, &s;ome hetero|geneous &s;ub&s;tances; but this mu&s;t be effected in <HI>bal|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o mariae,</HI> with alembics either of earth or gla&s;s, taking care always to throw away the two or three fir&s;t pints, that pa&s;s into the receiver, to avoid certain heterogeneous and volatile &s;ub&s;tances, which ri&s;e by di&s;tillation, with the fir&s;t portions of water.

<P>N. B. In the Fractions of Grains I have taken the neare&s;t that could be expre&s;&s;ed by &s;ingle Figures, in tho&s;e of Avoirdupois Drachms I have made U&s;e of Decimals.</P>
</FLOATEXT>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
in the &s;ame country, care mu&s;t be taken, where it is po&s;&s;ible, to make u&s;e of weights, and to reduce foreign ones to tho&s;e of the country we live in. The author him&s;elf has followed the weights and mea&s;ures of the country he does inhabit; I will follow the Engli&s;h one, called <HI>Troy,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Called in French <HI>poids de marc,</HI> or &s;ilver &s;mith's weight. The &s;ame is u&s;ed in Paris.</NOTE> as it has more affi|nity to the Montpellier weight, being di|vided like that into ounces, drachms, &s;cruples, and grains. The Troy pound indeed, con|tains only twelve ounces, and the Montpellier &s;ixteen, but in the ounce, there is only a dif|ference of &s;even grains and an half, the <HI>Troy</HI> ounce being &s;o much heavier than the Mont|pellier. In the drachm, the difference is le&s;s than a grain, in the &s;cruple, not a third of one. The grain differs more in proportion, as the Mont|pellier &s;cruple is divided into twenty four grains, and the <HI>Troy</HI> &s;cruple into only twenty; but for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e, who may be cu|rious to know the exact difference between the Engli&s;h and Montpellier weights, I have added a table, in which is expre&s;&s;ed the value of the Montpellier pound, half pound, ounce, drachm, and grains, both in <HI>Troy</HI> and <HI>Avoir-du-Pois</HI> weight, as likewi&s;e the &s;everal values of the&s;e &s;orts of weights, compared with the Montpel|lier and with each other; and this I imagine will be the more welcome, as mo&s;t of the au|thors, who treat of the compari&s;on of Engli&s;h
<PB N="20" REF="20">and French weights, are more likely to mi&s;lead than to inform their readers. I cannot help remarking here, that the origin of different weights, aro&s;e from the ancient cu&s;tom of re|gulating them by that of a barley corn, which &s;erved as a &s;tandard for all the re&s;t, by mul|tiplying them into carats, &s;cruples, drachms, ounces, pounds, &amp;c; but, as it nece&s;&s;arily hap|pened, that the barley corns, made u&s;e of in different countries, weighed more or le&s;s on account of their &s;ize, moi&s;ture, or dryne&s;s, it gave ri&s;e to the difference of weights, and made it difficult to a&s;certain preci&s;ely tho&s;e of different countries. It is much to be wi&s;hed that the different powers of Europe would come to a general regulation of weights, it would be a change of much greater import|ance to trade than that of the old &s;tile, which all nations have not adopted, though there are none who would not find their account in having a general or univer&s;al &s;tandard for mea|&s;ure and weight. This, which was always looked on as an impo&s;&s;ibility, would be the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be executed, without any expence to governments, and with the ea&s;ie&s;t one for every individual.</P>
<P>But let us now return to the method of pre&s;cribing the extract of Saturn, and again re&s;ume our &s;ubject, from which this epi&s;ode has &s;omewhat hurried me. I &s;hall then make u&s;e of the weight, generally known by the name of <HI>Troy-weight.</HI> The proper and ge|nerally
<PB N="21" REF="21" MS="y">pre&s;cribed quantity of extract to a bot|tle of pure water,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ought to weigh 29 or 30 ounces.</NOTE> is two drachms (five penny weight) if the extract is well made, which quan|tity will make about a hundred and ten drops. Now, if we &s;uppo&s;e the bottle ought to weigh twenty-nine <HI>Troy</HI> ounces, and a gla&s;s of water to weigh about three ounces, the quantity of extract, according to the proportion given by Mr. Goulard, would exceed, or at lea&s;t be equal to that of the vegeto-mineral water pre&s;cribed by him for common u&s;es, when, on the contrary, the quantity ought to be dimini&s;hed con&s;iderably. So that I would recommend, in inflammations of the eyes, to put only two drops of the extract to every ounce of water, and the &s;ame proportion to be ob&s;erved in all ca&s;es, where the &s;en&s;ibility of the part is equal|ly delicate, e&s;pecially &s;ince Mr. Goulard has brought his extract to &s;o great a degree of perfection.</P>
<P>The method of counting the drops is to have a cork bored from end to end, through which pa&s;s a tube about the &s;ize of a &s;mall quill commonly called a pinion; this quill mu&s;t be cut off at both ends, like the obtu&s;e end of a tooth-pick; and of the two extremi|ties of the tube thus cut, one enters into the bottle, and the other remains on the out&s;ide of the cork. By inclining the bottle down|wards and putting the end of the fore-finger
<PB N="22" REF="22">upon the aperture of the tube you may let the drops fall at plea&s;ure, one after the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Goulard does not recommend his po|matum in opthalmies, and I think with great rea&s;on; grea&s;y and oleagenous &s;ub&s;tances are always dangerous in inflammations of the eyes, and eri&s;ipelatous complaints, though they are equally advi&s;eable for tho&s;e of the ears: he ought to have recommended the frequent wa&s;hing the eyes, externally with the vegeto-mineral water, and keeping a bol&s;ter con&s;tantly on them, well wetted with that water. This I have con&s;tantly practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, but you mu&s;t be careful always to add &s;ome brandy, and even that which is camphorated. This omi&s;&s;ion, on the part of the author in his fir&s;t pre&s;cription, gives an air of ob&s;curity to the la&s;t part of his &s;econd paragraph, by putting you in mind there of the nece&s;&s;ity of making u&s;e of brandy in the &s;econd pre&s;cription, as well as in the fir&s;t; a circum&s;tance he has entirely omitted. Let it be remarked, that camphorated brandy on all occa&s;ions is to be preferred to the non|camphorated, as I &s;hall endeavour to prove in the following article.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It is my opinion, that in the ca&s;es, in which the author recommends the u&s;e of camphire, one of the mo&s;t antiphlogi&s;tic, and anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines in phy&s;ic or &s;urgery, he does not pre|&s;cribe it in large quantities enough. Camphire is one of tho&s;e medicines we u&s;e too &s;paringly,
<PB N="23" REF="23">not being &s;ufficiently conver&s;ant in its effects, which are always wonderful, whether made u&s;e of externally or internally. I would re|commend a work of Mr. Pouteau, intitled, <HI>Melanges de Chirurgie,</HI> which would con|vince any one of the good qualities of this drug. I know an Engli&s;h gentleman, who not only pre&s;erves him&s;elf from, but cures him&s;elf of many complaints by the u&s;e of camphire, of which he takes inwardly a large quantity; and always carries about him a box of it. When I make u&s;e of this with the extract of Saturn, it is in large quantities, and with &s;ome precautions different from tho&s;e of Mr. Goulard. If it is given in &s;mall quan|tities, it has no effect; when mixed with po|matums, cerates, liniments, it is obliged to undergo the heat of fire, by which means the volatile parts of it are evaporated; what re|mains of them, in&s;en&s;ibly pa&s;&s;es away, &s;o that in a few days none is left. Whenever the vegeto-mineral water is made u&s;e of, I would recommend the &s;ame quantity of campho|rated brandy, as the author pre&s;cribes of that which is not camphorated. This campho|rated brandy &s;hould be kept in a bottle well corked; you mu&s;t be careful likewi&s;e to fill it up now and then, and &s;ee that the camphire you make u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e is not too airy, but that it is fre&s;h, oily, and of a &s;trong perfume.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
<P N="7">VII. Mr. Goulard recommends the vegeto|mineral water to be warmed only during the winter, and to make u&s;e of it in &s;ummer in its natural &s;tate. This di&s;tinction may be a very ju&s;t one at Montpellier, and in other warm climates; but in England and other cold countries it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary al|ways to warm it, otherwi&s;e the metallic particles are not &s;o thoroughly divided; and by the water's being impregnated with the vegetable parts only the repelling proper|ty, with which it is reproach'd, only re|mains; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all cold wa|ters, they act as repellents, by cau&s;ing too great a ten&s;ion in the fibres they ought to relax, and the colder they are the greater is their repelling power; but when warmed, they are of a moi&s;tening, relaxing, &s;oftening and re&s;olving quality. But particular care mu&s;t be taken not to exceed the do&s;e above pre|&s;cribed in inflammatory ca&s;es; Mr. Co&s;mond a celebrated &s;urgeon has well ob&s;erved that the leaden particles, when introduced into the ve&s;&s;els in too large a quantity, irritate and force them &s;o con&s;iderably, as frequently to add to the complaint, in&s;tead of relieving it. This is a fault that many, who are ignorant of the effects of this remedy, frequently fall into; and often blame the medicine, when them|&s;elves are only in fault.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es, where the lymph only is affected, the &s;ame precaution is not nece&s;&s;ary, as a
<PB N="25" REF="25">drachm or two of extract more may be &s;afely added to each bottle of water.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Such, as are little ver&s;ed in the know|ledge of the medicinal virtues of metals, are very apt to make co&s;metic pomatums with the vegeto-mineral water. The&s;e have fol|lowed the errors handed down to us by our ance&s;tors, who have made u&s;e of lead under various forms; others did u&s;e &s;uch as magi&s;|teries of pewter and bi&s;muth, &amp;c. which have rather &s;erved to de&s;troy the beauty of the &s;kin, than to pre&s;erve it; the rea&s;on is evident: the&s;e metals, by infinuating them&s;elves into the pores, there depo&s;e &s;ome of their par|ticles the mo&s;t divided, and by fir&s;t opening, and then filling up the&s;e pores &s;poil the fine&s;t features.</P>
<P>The&s;e metallic particles become of a black dye, and plainly &s;hew a leaden colour, which can be concealed only from the eye, by the application of a white wa&s;h compo&s;ed of the &s;ame drug, which by plai&s;tering over the &s;ur|face of the &s;kin add to its deformity. The author of the&s;e remarks begs leave to caution the fair &s;ex from tru&s;ting to the&s;e pomatums, the compo&s;ition of which is a &s;ecret, the bet|ter to conceal the known poi&s;on they are fraught with, which for a &s;hort time appears to an&s;wer their intentions, only to give the deeper wound afterwards. Time only can re-e&s;tabli&s;h nature, and the u&s;e of the poma|tums de&s;cribed by the author in his Treati&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="26">on Ruptures, p. 138, by leaving out the gold and the &s;affron, the fir&s;t making the &s;kin black, the other yellow. This pomatum, without altering the &s;kin, &s;oftens, and nouri&s;hes it, pre&s;erves its tran&s;parency, de&s;troys tetters and redne&s;s, fills up wrinkles, and repairs all da|mages done to it, either by the u&s;e of other pomatums or paint. This pomatum is infi|nitely &s;uperior to that of Saturn, or the cerate for removing the piles, for the &s;calding of the &s;kin, and to remove the &s;pots, which re|main after the &s;mall pox, if applied to it &s;ome time after the eruption.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I mu&s;t here add, that the pure liquid extract of Saturn,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is the liquid extract only, which is mentioned it this Treati&s;e.</NOTE> mixed with double the quantity of oil of turpentine is the mo&s;t &s;overeign remedy known again&s;t a &s;prain in a hor&s;e, by rubbing him with this liniment, as &s;oon as the accident happens, taking care to keep the part well covered, till you have got him home to the &s;table; if he &s;hould &s;till continue lame, or appear in pain, you mu&s;t rub him again, before he grows cold, and repeat this every four hours, keep him well cloathed, and allow him but half his u&s;ual quantity of food, and give him warm water with &s;ome bran in it to promote per&s;piration: it &s;eldom happens, if the&s;e rules are attended to, but that the cure is compleated in four-and-twenty hours.</P>
