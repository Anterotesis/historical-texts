<HEAD>PROPOSALS FOR THE RECOVERY OF PERSONS <HI>APPARENTLY DEAD</HI> BY DROWNING, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reports of &s;everal e&s;tabli&s;hments on the Continent, as well as of the Humane Society in London, have fully proved, that per&s;ons apparently dead from drowning, or &s;uffo|cation from other cau&s;es, may, by proper means, be re&s;tored to life. But whil&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s which has attended the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to every per&s;on intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of humanity; yet it is to be regretted, that the means of re&s;to|ration have not been more publicly under&s;tood, and more gene|rally adopted.</P>
<P>The frequent in&s;tances of death, by drowning, which have happened upon the river Tyne, and the un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts of recovery, have afforded the &s;tronge&s;t proofs, that the methods of re&s;toration have not been known to the public, or have not been &s;peedily or properly applied.</P>
<P>In order to give relief to per&s;ons in &s;uch unfortunate circum|&s;tances, in this town and neighbourhood, the Governors of the NEWCASTLE DISPENSARY have e&s;tabli&s;hed a department of their Charity, on the following plan, for the recovery of the vital motions, when &s;u&s;pended by drowning; and, to render this de|partment more u&s;eful, they have al&s;o extended it to the methods of re&s;toration in other ca&s;es of apparent death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>REMARKS</HI> ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF <HI>APPARENT DEATH.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE MEDICAL SOCIETY of Newca&s;tle, in com|pliance with the reque&s;t of the GOVERNORS of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, have inve&s;tigated the nature of <HI>apparent death,</HI> ari&s;|ing from the cau&s;es which become the object of the preceding plan, with care and attention: And, in the following Remarks, they have chiefly &s;tudied conci&s;ene&s;s, plainne&s;s, and preci&s;ion, that the public, at large, may under&s;tand a &s;ubject, in which they are &s;o peculiarly intere&s;ted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Apparent death con&s;i&s;ts in a total, tho' temporary ce&s;&s;ation of all the powers of motion and &s;en&s;e; to be more particular, the lungs cea&s;e to act; the heart and arteries to beat; and the brain and nerves to diffu&s;e their energy. It, therefore, only differs from real death, in this, that the living principle is not extinct, but only lies dormant; which, &s;ometimes &s;pontaneou&s;ly, but more frequently and certainly, when excited by proper means, again becomes active: In con&s;equence of which, all the functions of life are re&s;tored.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The common opinion, that life de&s;erts the body as &s;oon as the breath cea&s;es, is not confined to the vulgar alone; but, not|with&s;tanding the in&s;tances of recovery from apparent death, is &s;till belleved by many of the more di&s;cerning part of the com|munity. As this opinion has been productive of the mo&s;t dan|gerous con&s;equences, the SOCIETY wi&s;h to impre&s;s the public with the following truth; that the living principle, in every ca&s;e of death, keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the body for &s;ome time, at lea&s;t, after all the actions of life have di&s;appeared; nay, probably, it never entirely leaves the body, &s;o long as any degree of animal heat remains in the internal parts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. By proper attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances (2.3.), the SO|CIETY flatter them&s;elves, that per&s;ons &s;uddenly and apparently
<PB N="6" REF="6">dead, e&s;pecially from the cau&s;es, to be afterwards enumerated, will, for the future, not be con&s;idered to be <HI>really</HI> dead, till &s;uch time as the methods of re&s;toration have had a fair trial.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. But whil&s;t the SOCIETY endeavour to animate the public, to u&s;e every exertion to recover tho&s;e apparently dead, they do not wi&s;h to conceal the great uncertainty of a &s;ucce&s;sful termi|nation. In drowning, e&s;pecially, the methods of treatment prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, from the per&s;on lying too long under water; from his being &s;uddenly &s;eized with other di&s;ea&s;es, or being in a &s;tate of intoxication, at the time of the accident; and from vari|ous other cau&s;es. But, in &s;uch dangerous &s;ituations, if <HI>one</HI> in <HI>fifty</HI> can be re&s;tored, it will amply compen&s;ate for many fruitle&s;s attempts. If, however, any per&s;on conceive this to be a &s;mall proportion, let him but for a moment con&s;ider, if this <HI>one</HI> &s;hould happen to be his own &s;on, or a beloved friend, with what raptures he would extol the means which had averted the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s!</ITEM>
</LIST>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the Nature of APPARENT DEATH from DROWN|ING, and on the mo&s;t effectual Methods of Recovery.</HEAD>
<P N="6">6. From various experiments, in&s;tituted by different members of the SOCIETY, the following appearances have been ob&s;erved to take place in drowning, to which the attention of the reader is reque&s;ted, as not only pointing out the nature of the death, but the methods, which ought to be employed to effect a re|covery.</P>
<P N="7">7. When an animal is kept under water, in a few &s;econds it begins to emit its breath forcibly, &s;o as to occa&s;ion air bubbles. This emi&s;&s;ion of air from its lungs is followed with as &s;trong a de&s;ire to draw in air, and in the&s;e efforts, it commonly in&s;pires water<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">As it was thought of con&s;equence to a&s;certain this point; a cat, &s;ix weeks old, was frequently immer&s;ed in a &s;trong &s;olution of copperas, and as frequently allowed to come above the &s;urface, to in&s;pire, in order to im|itate what frequently happens in drowning. It was at la&s;t brought up, before it was dead, and in&s;tantly &s;trangled. Upon di&s;&s;ection, the frothy fluid in the lungs, and the lungs them&s;elves, became as black as ink, upon adding a tea-&s;poon full of infu&s;ion of galls to the former, and moi&s;tening the lungs with a little of the &s;ame infu&s;ion. The experiment, with the &s;ame re&s;ult, was repeated on a young whelp.</NOTE>. Its &s;truggles, in a few minutes, become impercepti|ble, and it falls down motionle&s;s. Upon taking it out of the water, provided only eight or ten minutes have elap&s;ed after all its &s;truggles are over, the no&s;e and mouth appear remarkably pale, the eyes do not protrude, and the pupils, tho' they nearly retain their natural lu&s;tre, are quite dilated; all &s;en&s;e and mo|tion, both external and internal, except a &s;light contraction of the right &s;ide of the heart, are now lo&s;t; and if no means of recovery
<PB N="7" REF="7">he made u&s;e of, the body gradually becomes cold, and with the lo&s;s of heat, the heart lo&s;es the power of contraction.</P>
<P N="8">8. Upon di&s;&s;ection, no fulne&s;s in the ve&s;&s;els within the &s;kull, nor any di&s;ea&s;e in the brain, or its membranes, are to be found. The lungs al&s;o appear &s;ound; are generally about half di&s;tended, but &s;ometimes more, when the animal is frequently allowed to come to the &s;urface of the water, &s;o that he may in&s;pire. A quantity of frothy fluid<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">By drowning a large old cat, and a kitten of four weeks old, in a &s;olution of copperas, one ounce of frothy fluid was found in the air ve&s;&s;els of the lungs of the former; and one dram and a half of the &s;ame fluid in the latter: By adding a &s;trong infu&s;ion of galls, the fluid in both became black, and as near as could be a&s;certained, the quantity of &s;olution of cop|peras, in the lungs of the former amounted to two drams; and in the latter to two &s;cruples. But, in one experiment, made by another member of the Society, the water in the lungs of a drowned whelp of five weeks old, was much more con&s;iderable; and water was al&s;o found in its &s;tomach.</NOTE>, con&s;i&s;ting of mucus, with a little of the water in which the animal was drowned, in every experi|ment except one, was &s;queezed from the lungs.</P>
<P N="9">9. The right-&s;ide of the heart is full of black blood, and the large veins going out from this &s;ide of the heart, thro' their whole cour&s;e, to the middle of the thighs, the arm-pits, and almo&s;t to the jaws, are full of blood of the &s;ame colour. The left-&s;ide of the heart is almo&s;t empty, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e with the whole of the large arteries, except the trunks of the artery, which en|ters the lungs, which is commonly filled with blood. The ex|ternal blood-ve&s;&s;els are empty, and the mu&s;cles commonly look as white as if the animal had been bled to death.</P>
<P N="10">10. Upon the whole, it appears (8.9.), that no injury is done to the organization of the vital parts; but that the heart and large veins, in its neighbourhood, are di&s;tended with blood, whil&s;t every other part &s;eems, in a great mea&s;ure, to be drained of that fluid. Nor are the&s;e circum&s;tances invalidated by the ap|pearances, which have been ob&s;erved in &s;ome bodies of drowned per&s;ons, who are never opened till many hours after death; for altho', in a few, the ve&s;&s;els of the brain have been found full of blood, yet, generally, this organ, as al&s;o the lungs, have been found in a &s;ound &s;tate. Neither does the prominent, or blood|&s;hot eye, the &s;welled bloated face, or the lividity of the &s;kin, which are &s;o often ob&s;erved in drowned per&s;ons, who have been long under water, prove any thing more, than that the blood, af|ter death, had drained to depending parts.</P>
<P N="11">11. From what has been advanced, in the three preceding para|graphs, it appears, that the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the vi|tal motions in drowning, is the &s;toppage of re&s;piration; in con&s;equence of which the circulation cannot be carried on, and the blood, therefore, is accumulated in the right-&s;ide of the heart, and in all the large internal veins. With this &s;toppage of the
<PB N="8" REF="8">circulation, the brain lo&s;es its energy, the body becomes cold, and with the total lo&s;s of heat, it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the principle of life is extingui&s;hed<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Altho' not immediately connected with the &s;ubject, the SOCIETY cannot help entering a caution again&s;t the ha&s;ty cu&s;tom of laying out per|&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead. In great &s;inking of the &s;trength, e&s;pecially in the end of acute di&s;ea&s;es, patients frequently lie in a &s;tate exactly re&s;embling death. If the bed-cloaths be removed, the heat, on which the vital princi|ple depends, will &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated, and every &s;park of life de&s;troyed. By not attending to this circum&s;tance, it is to be feared, that many have been actually killed, who, by a different treatment, would have recovered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="12">12. From this view of the &s;ubject, the mo&s;t likely means to re&s;tore per&s;ons apparently dead by drowning, will con&s;i&s;t: 1&s;t, in renewing the action of the lungs, without which the accumula|tion of blood about the heart cannot be removed; nor the heart it&s;elf be brought into proper motion: And 2d, in &s;upport|ing a due degree of animal heat, without which the vital princi|ple cannot, with effect, exert its influence.</P>
<P N="13">13. To re&s;tore the action of the lungs, it is indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be inflated. When the per&s;on has not been long under water, perhaps blowing air into the mouth or no&s;e with a wooden pipe may be all that is nece&s;&s;ary to put them into motion. But in many ca&s;es, it will require great &s;kill to in|flate them effectually. As the directions for doing this with in|&s;truments will be given in another place<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See the appendix. Paragraph 38, 39, 40, 41.</NOTE>, it would be improper to enlarge on them here. It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that the inflation ought not to be done with violence, but &s;o as to imi|tate natural, ea&s;y re&s;piration. And as, in many ca&s;es, the infla|tion ought to be continued for one or two hours, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to employ a pair of bellows. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, as &s;oon as the pul&s;e returns, the inflation &s;hould be gradually le&s;&s;en|ed, and, in a little time, totally laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P N="14">14. By artificial breathing (13.), judiciou&s;ly and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly em|ployed, not only the frothy fluid, already taken notice of (8.), which renders the recovery from drowning more uncertain than other ca&s;es of &s;uffocation, will be expelled; but the heart will mo&s;t likely be put into motion, by which the accumulation of the blood there, and in its neighbourhood (9.10.), will al&s;o be re|moved, and the circulation re&s;tored.</P>
<P N="15">15 At the &s;ame time, that the mea&s;ures recommended (13.) are a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed, other a&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;hould be endeavouring to re&s;tore, and to keep up a due degree of animal heat. Perhaps the &s;peedie&s;t method of doing this, (were hot water al|ways in readine&s;s) would be to put the patient into a warm bath. But as this cannot be &s;peedily procured, but more e&s;pecially, as it interferes with other e&s;&s;ential applications, the body mu&s;t be
<PB N="9" REF="9">gradually brought to a proper heat, by placing it on a warm bed, or mattre&s;s, and by the u&s;e of general frictions with warm cloaths<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">For more particular directions, &s;ee the Appendix. I.</NOTE>. The frictions, however, &s;hould be at fir&s;t moderate, and perform|ed only with a view to re&s;tore heat, and not force the blood to|wards the heart, which in drowned per&s;ons is generally found too much di&s;tended (9.10.).</P>
<P N="16">16. If the body has been taken out of the water in fro&s;ty weather, e&s;pecially if it has been afterwards long expo&s;ed to the air, the heat, at fir&s;t, &s;hould be applied in a very low degree; and if the thermometer be under the freezing point, and the body, when &s;tripped, feel cold, and nearly in a condition with tho&s;e that are frozen; it will, at fir&s;t, be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of frictions with &s;now, or cold applications, as heat, in &s;uch ca|&s;es, has been found pernicious. In a little time, however, heat mu&s;t be gradually employed.</P>
<P N="17">17. Upon the whole, great care and nicety ought to be ob|&s;erved in the application of heat, which, in every ca&s;e, ought to be proportioned to the powers of life. This is well elucidated by Mr Hunter in the following quotation:&mdash;"From ob&s;ervation and experiments, it appears to be a law of nature, in animal bodies, that the degree of external heat &s;hould bear a proportion to the quantity of life; as it is weakened, this proportion requires great accuracy in the adju&s;tment, while greater powers of life allow it greater latitudes. I was led to make the&s;e ob&s;ervations, by at|tending to per&s;ons who are fro&s;t-bitten; the effect of cold in this ca&s;e, being that of le&s;&s;ening the living principle. Heat mu&s;t, at fir&s;t, be gradually applied, and proportioned to the quantity of the living principle; but as that encrea&s;es, you may encrea&s;e the degree of heat. If this method is not ob&s;erved, and too great a degree of heat is at fir&s;t applied, the per&s;on or part lo&s;es entirely the living principle, and mortification en&s;ues. This proce&s;s invariably takes place with regard to men"<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Animal Oeconomy, p. 121, 122.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="18">18. Altho' the recovery of drowned per&s;ons depends almo&s;t entirely upon the methods recommended (13.15.16.); yet when the body is in a condition to be acted upon, cordial and invigo|rating medicines, &s;uch as throwing brandy and water into the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, pepper-mint water, aether, or &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, diluted with water, may prove u&s;eful auxiliaries<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix. II. Paragraph 42.</NOTE>. But the &s;ame moderation in their u&s;e mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, as has been recommended in the application of heat.</P>
<P N="19">19. The means for recovering the motion of the lungs, and animal heat, &s;hould often be continued for &s;everal hours; for it
<PB N="10" REF="10">appears from the reports of the <HI>Humane Society,</HI> that, in a very great number of ca&s;es, one, two, and even four hours, were per|&s;everingly employed before the fir&s;t &s;igns of life appeared<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">In many ca&s;es of complete recovery recorded in the HUMANE SOCIETY, the per&s;ons were under water twenty, thirty, one forty, and one forty-five minutes, and in the&s;e ca&s;es, the re&s;toration, as might be expect|ed, was tedious.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="20">20. Electricity being the mo&s;t powerful of all &s;timulants, it has been recommended by &s;everal ingenious authors<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">A. Fothergill, Henly, Hunter, Kite.</NOTE>, and, according to the reports of the <HI>Humane Society,</HI> has been found &s;erviceable in drowning; it ought, therefore, to be tried, when the heart cannot be brought to act by the means mentioned (14.). Shocks, therefore, may be tran&s;mitted thro' the heart, the head, and the &s;pinal marrow; but they ought neither to be employed &s;o gently as to produce no effect, nor &s;o violently as to do mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P N="21">21. The SOCIETY being of opinion, that bleeding can be &s;eldom employed as the means of recovery, refrain from recommending it in the beginning; but when life returns, and the pul&s;e will bear &s;uch an evacuation, it will frequently become indi&s;pen&s;ably requifite to remove determinations to the head, and to the lungs; which often take place from an irregular di&s;tribution of the blood to the&s;e organs.</P>
<P N="22">22. As the remarks, which have been already offered, will ap|ply, with a few exceptions, to other ca&s;es of &s;uffocation, the SO|CIETY &s;hall briefly di&s;cu&s;s the remaining part of the &s;ubject.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPARENT DEATH from HANGING.</HEAD>
<P N="23">23. In hanging, the external ve&s;&s;els, bringing back the blood from the head, are immediately compre&s;&s;ed, while the blood is &s;till carried on in the internal arteries. The windpipe is &s;oon after &s;hut by the cord, the ingre&s;s of air prevented; in con&s;e|quence of this, the face becomes red and livid, and the per&s;on or animal is &s;peedily carried off by &s;uffocation.</P>
<P N="24">24. On di&s;&s;ection, the blood ve&s;&s;els of the brain, in &s;everal ani|mals that were &s;trangled, appeared turgid with blood, but no o|ther di&s;ea&s;e was ob&s;erved within the &s;kull. The lungs were, in general, quite collap&s;ed, free from frothy fluid, and in every re|&s;pect &s;ound. The heart and large adjoining ve&s;&s;els exhibited ex|actly the &s;ame appearances as in drowned animals (8.9.10.).</P>
<P N="25">25. From this view (23.24.) it would appear, that, together with bleeding from the jugular veins, or cupping in the neck, the other methods of treatment ought to be the &s;ame as recommend|ed for the recovery of drowned per&s;ons.</P>

From &s;ome experiments, which would be tedious to re|late, it appears that the&s;e vapours (26.) occa&s;ion a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the vital motions, and death, by entering the lungs; and, ex|cluding the atmo&s;pheric air, and in other re&s;pects (if the <HI>fire-damp</HI> be excepted) when it takes flame<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>fire-damp</HI> frequently takes flame, by which means the pitmen are often mi&s;erably burnt. At the &s;ame time, others are &s;ound without &s;igns of life; and as they are erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be burnt to death by the flame, and not &s;uffocated by the vapour, methods of re&s;toration unfor|tunately are &s;eldom applied.</NOTE>, no farther injury is done to the body.</P>
<P N="29">29. The bodies of animals, &s;uffocated in the&s;e vapours, exhi|bit the following appearances:&mdash;The limbs remain flexible for a long time; the eyes retain their lu&s;tre; the temperature of the body, and even a heat higher than the healthy &s;tandard, in &s;ome in&s;tances, continue &s;everal hours after death. This is particu|larly the ca&s;e with animals &s;uffocated in the &s;teams of charcoal; and in them the blood remains fluid, and even highly florid. In animals &s;uffocated in fixed, and in inflammable air, altho' the limbs continue flexible, the blood was not florid. The ve&s;&s;els of the brain were found turgid in animals &s;uffocated in the&s;e va|pours; the lungs were &s;ound; the heart and adjoining ve&s;&s;els were equally turgid as in tho&s;e which were drowned or hanged.</P>
<P N="30">30. The mo&s;t effectual means of recovering the vital actions, when &s;u&s;pended by noxious vapours, con&s;i&s;t in inflating the lungs as &s;oon as the body is removed to the open air; in &s;prinkling the face, and, when the heat is above the &s;tandard of health, even the whole body, with cold water. In per&s;ons &s;uffocated by the fumes of charcoal, advantages have ari&s;en from rubbing the body with &s;now. But here the heat &s;hould be <HI>only dimini&s;hed in pro|portion to the powers of life;</HI> and, therefore, if the body become cold, equal advantage will accrue from the gradual application of warmth. The &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain (29.) would &s;eem to require bleeding; and accordingly it has been recommend|ed<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">PORTAL.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>APPARENT DEATH from SMOTHERING, and the want of RESPIRATION in &s;till-born CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P N="31">31. Children, from inattention or other cau&s;es, are frequent|ly &s;mothered in beds. When not overlaid, the functions of life are &s;olely &s;u&s;pended by breathing confined air. From experi|ments upon brutes, it appears that, in this ca&s;e, the lungs are collap&s;ed, and, except the accumulation of blood in the heart, and large ve&s;&s;els in the neighbourhood, no injury is done to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. If the means of recovery, therefore, be not too long delayed after the lungs and heart have cea&s;ed to act, there will be great hopes of re&s;toring the patient. If the body be too hot, as is commonly the ca&s;e, it &s;hould be expo&s;ed, at fir&s;t, to a current of air. The lungs &s;hould be immediately in|flated; and, afterwards, in every other re&s;pect, it &s;hould be treated conformably to what has been recommended in &s;uffoca|tion from drowning.</P>
<P N="32">32. In &s;uch &s;till-born children as come into the world, in other re&s;pects, with a healthy appearance, great hopes may be enter|tained from inflating the lungs, if too much time have not been lo&s;t. But this proce&s;s ought to be continued a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly for &s;ome hours, by blowing air thro' a quill, or any &s;mall tube in&s;erted into the mouth. The temperature of the body &s;hould at the &s;ame time be kept up by a due degree of warmth; and the blood propelled from the &s;urface to the heart by proper frictions.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P N="33">33. As &s;oon as the body is taken out of the water, a per&s;on mu&s;t inflate the lungs of the patient, by blowing into the mouth, or, (which is better) into one no&s;tril, thro' a wooden pipe<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Wooden pipes are always in readine&s;s at the receiving-hou&s;es.</NOTE>, a roll of cap-paper, or any thing el&s;e that will effectually convey the breath up the no&s;tril; whil&s;t the other no&s;tril, together with the mouth, is clo&s;ely &s;hut, that no air may pa&s;s otherwi&s;e than by the pipe. At the time of blowing thro' the pipe, another per&s;on, in order to prevent the air getting into the &s;tomach, mu&s;t

When the lungs are filled, the per&s;on mu&s;t remove his hand from the mouth, and pre&s;s the belly and brea&s;t, &s;o as to let the air pa&s;s out. When by the&s;e means the lungs have emptied them&s;elves, the blowing thro' the pipe is to be repeated in the &s;ame manner, &s;o that natural breathing, as far as po&s;&s;ible, may be imitated. If the lungs cannot be, by the&s;e means, di&s;tended, it mo&s;t pro|bably will proceed from &s;ome &s;toppage about the opening into the windpipe, which will in all likelihood be removed by pulling the tongue forwards.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CONTAINING </HI>A De&s;cription of a Pocket CASE of INSTRUMENTS for the Recovery of Per&s;ons apparently dead, with the Methods of USING them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="38">38. Many ingenious in&s;truments have been recommended by authors, and adopted by different e&s;tabli&s;hments in their endea|vours to recover the apparently dead; but the MEDICAL SOCI|ETY have preferred the improvements lately made upon them by Mr SAVIGNY of London, both on account of the utility of the in&s;truments, and their being contained in a ca&s;e, which is ex|tremely portable. Some management, however, is required to adju&s;t the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> to the different purpo&s;es; but a careful in&s;pection of their component parts<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Mr Savigny's original ca&s;e contained an <HI>apparatus</HI> for injecting the fumes of tobacco, which the SOCIETY have not recommended.</NOTE>, and attention to the following directions, will render their application ea&s;y.</P>
<P N="39">39. When air from the lungs of a healthy per&s;on is to be u&s;ed, the <HI>ivory mouth-piece</HI> is to be &s;crewed on one end of the <HI>flexible tube of red leather,</HI> and the <HI>ivory nozle</HI> upon its other ex|tremity, by which means, a blow-pipe is compleatly formed; which is to be in&s;erted into the no&s;tril; and to be managed in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>wooden pipe</HI> (33.). But as atmo&s;pheric air<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Dephlogi&s;ticated air, di&s;covered by Dr Prie&s;tly, pre&s;erved in blad|ders, has been recommended by &s;everal authors; but as the expan&s;ion of the lungs &s;eems to be the principal object of the inflation, the <HI>Society</HI> think it of little importance whether dephlogi&s;ticated, or atmo&s;pheric air be u&s;ed; and indeed, tho&s;e who have recommended the former were never able to re|cover any animal with it, when atmo&s;pheric air had been found ineffectual.</NOTE> &s;hould be, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, preferred for inflating the lungs properly, the following adju&s;tment of the in&s;trument will be required: The conical part of the <HI>hollow &s;crew,</HI> by means of the <HI>bra&s;s winch,</HI> is to be firmly &s;crewed into the muzzle of any common pair of <HI>bellows</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Proper bellows are always in readine&s;s at the place where the in&s;tru|ments are lodged.</NOTE>: The <HI>ivory mouth-piece</HI> of the <HI>flexi|ble
<PB N="15" REF="15">tube,</HI> is then to be removed, and the other end of the <HI>conical &s;crew</HI> to be fitted in its place. The in&s;trument being thus com|pleted, "a proper per&s;on, &s;tationed at the head of the body, is to pa&s;s the tube into the no&s;tril, and &s;u&s;taining it there with the fore-finge, he is to compre&s;s the other no&s;tril with his thumb, and the mouth with the remainder of the &s;ame hand, that no air may pa&s;s out. With the other hand, he is to make a &s;uitable pre&s;&s;ure upon the prominent part of the windpipe, to pre|vent air pa&s;&s;ing into the &s;tomach. The medical director is then to work the bellows, which ought, at one play, to throw in a &s;ufficient quantity of air to fill the lungs. When they are pro|perly di&s;tended, the hand &s;hould be removed from the mouth, and the lungs are to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in emptying them&s;elves by com|pre&s;&s;ing the belly and che&s;t. The &s;ame proce&s;s is to be repeated for &s;ome time, that, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the manner of natural re&s;|piration may be imitated." If the air do not pa&s;s into the lungs &s;o as to di&s;tend them compleatly, it probably ari&s;es from the a|perture of the windpipe being &s;hut, which may generally be re|medied by bringing the tongue forwards.</P>
<P N="40">40. But if farther impediments occur to the inflation of the lungs, the <HI>ivory nozle</HI> (39) mu&s;t be removed, and the <HI>&s;ilver in|&s;trument</HI> in the form of a catheter &s;crewed on the <HI>tube of red lea|ther,</HI> in its place. The in&s;trument being thus completed, "the medical director &s;hould place him&s;elf on the right &s;ide of the pa|tient; and introducing the fore-finger of his left hand, at the corner of the patient's mouth, he &s;hould pu&s;h the point of it be|hind the <HI>epiglottis,</HI> and u&s;ing this finger as a directory, he mu&s;t enter the tube, with the other hand, at the left corner of the mouth, till the end of the in&s;trument has pa&s;t beyond the point of his fore-finger; and the in&s;trument is then to be &s;uffered to fall rather than to be pu&s;hed into the <HI>glottis."</HI> The bellows are then to be worked as in the former proce&s;s (39).</P>
<P N="41">41. If the methods propo&s;ed (39.40.), fail of inflating the lungs, an opening into the wind-pipe may be made; and cer|tainly ought to be tried as a la&s;t re&s;ource. The &s;ilver in&s;tru|ment &s;hould be introduced into the opening, fitted with the bellows, and to be worked in the &s;ame manner as recommended (40.); by which means air will be certainly thrown into the lungs.</P>
<P N="42">42. The next in&s;trument recommended is the <HI>ela&s;tic tube of black leather,</HI> for conveying medicines into the &s;tomach. The &s;mall end mu&s;t be carefully introduced down the gullet, into the &s;tomach; and any liquid cordial, &s;uch as <HI>&s;pirits, aether, volatile liquor of hart&s;horn,</HI> or <HI>oil of peppermint,</HI> properly diluted with water, mu&s;t be poured in &s;mall quantities into the other end of the tube; and if the liquor do not de&s;cend readily, blowing upon it will make it pa&s;s into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="43">43. The next in&s;trument is a large <HI>bladder,</HI> which may in&s;tant|ly
<PB N="16" REF="16">be connected with a proper pipe, contained in a divi&s;ion of the ca&s;e. A cly&s;ter prepared with <HI>brandy, gin,</HI> or the <HI>oil of pep|permint,</HI> largely diluted with warm water, mu&s;t be injected.</P>
<P N="44">44. Altho', from the &s;ympathy which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts betwixt the &s;tomach and whole &s;y&s;tem, and the irritability remaining long in the inte&s;tines, much benefit may ari&s;e from the proce&s;&s;es (42.43.) as auxiliaries; yet no means, unle&s;s for a very &s;hort &s;pace, mu&s;t interfere with the more important articles of <HI>inflating the lungs,</HI> and <HI>re&s;toring animal heat.</HI></P>
<P N="45">45. The la&s;t in&s;trument<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Proper phials for aether, volatile liquor of hart&s;horn, and oil of pep|per-mint are al&s;o contained in the ca&s;e; and likewi&s;e pho&s;phoric matches, and a wax candle, when a light cannot be otherwi&s;e readily procured.</NOTE> is a <HI>thermometer</HI> upon Mr HUN|TER'S principles, which is extremely well calculated for a&s;certain|ing the natural heat remaining in the body; and for regulating the application of artificial heat. The freezing point is marked on the &s;tem by a &s;cratch on the gla&s;s, and the divi&s;ions upon an ivory &s;cale embracing the gla&s;s; are ea&s;ily &s;een thro' the &s;tem.&mdash;By applying this in&s;trument to the body, and finding the temperature con&s;iderably below 98^o, artificial heat &s;hould be gradually applied till it be uniformly heated to 98^o, or 100^o. But if the external parts of the body be &s;o chilled, that the ther|mometer &s;inks below 32^o, cold applications will be at fir&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary; and in this ca&s;e the heat &s;hould be afterwards increa&s;ed &s;lowly and gradually.&mdash;The in&s;trument may likewi&s;e be ea&s;ily introduced into any cavity, &s;o as to a&s;certain the degree of internal heat; which remains, in general, for &s;ome hours after the external &s;urface is cold. Therefore, if it be pu&s;hed three or four inches up the <HI>rectum,</HI> the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of life may be a&s;cer|tained by the ri&s;e or fall of Mercury in the tube.</P>
