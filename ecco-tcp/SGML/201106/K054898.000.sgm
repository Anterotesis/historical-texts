<P>REASONS Why the Practice of <HI>INOCULATION</HI> Ought to be introduced into the Town of <HI>B&V;RY</HI> AT PRESENT.</P>

<HEAD>SOME REASONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Number of People who have not had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is &s;o great, that in the Way of accidental Pro|pagation it will probably remain in the Town a very long Time &s;till, to the va&s;t Detriment of all Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps the Lo&s;s of the A&s;&s;izes, Se&s;&s;ions, Fair and other publick Meetings: Whereas if Inoculation was generally practi&s;ed, it might be got through the Town in a very &s;hort Time. In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e we may have it two Years; in the La&s;t, we need not have it &s;ix Months.</P>
<P N="2">2 As the utmo&s;t Hazard of dying of the inoculated <HI>Small Pox,</HI> appears by the la&s;t authen|tic Accounts, to be no more than that of 1 in 50, and by the &s;ame Accounts that of dying of the Natural is &s;hewn to be that of One in Six; it would be the Means of &s;aving great Numbers of Lives. For In&s;tance, let us &s;up|po&s;e that there are Three-thou&s;and Per&s;ons in <HI>Bury</HI> who have not had the <HI>Small Pox:</HI> The 50th Part of Three-thou&s;and, or the Number
<PB N="4" REF="3">of Per&s;ons which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to die of Inoculation, is Sixty; but the 6th Part of Three-thou&s;and, or the Number of Per&s;ons that are to be &s;uppo&s;ed to die of the natural <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> is 500. Deduct Sixty from Five-hundred, and there will remain Four-hundred and Forty for the Number of Lives which may be clearly &s;aved by Inoculation upon this Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>UNDER this Article it is to be ob&s;erved, that the inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> has been found to be as favourable to grown People, as to Children; but all the World knows the Con|trary is True of the Natural in a high Degree. So that if we con&s;ider the Value of the Lives as well as the Number, we &s;hall have &s;till farther rea&s;on for the Practice: For I &s;uppo&s;e every One thinks the Life of a grown Per|&s;on (e&s;pecially of the Head of a Family) to be of more Con&s;equence than that of a Child.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o probable that the Hazard of dy|ing of the inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> is le&s;s than that of One in Fifty. An impartial Judge who reads the Accounts of tho&s;e who died af|ter Inoculation will &s;ee, that the Death of &s;e|veral cannot in Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice be imputed to <HI>that,</HI> and it is much to be que&s;tioned whe|ther the Preparation before Inoculation, the Pu&s;tules from whence the Matter was taken, and the Management of the Patient during the Di&s;temper have been in mo&s;t Ca&s;es, &s;uch as they ought to have been, and &s;uch as they
<PB N="5" REF="4">may be for the future. Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> out of a Hundred and Nineteen, which he inoculated, had only one that mi&s;carried. He is a Phy&s;i|cian in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> who&s;e Skill and Integrity no Man that knew him ever yet called in Que|&s;tion; and in a Letter to Me, dated <HI>February</HI> 27, 1729-30. when the <HI>Small Pox</HI> was much at <HI>Newark,</HI> he &s;ays where due Care is taken of the Choice of the infectious Matter, Inocu|lation will very rarely fail of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved that all tho&s;e, who have not had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and re&s;olve to continue in the Town mu&s;t almo&s;t certainly have it now; at lea&s;t Children and tho&s;e who go much about. So that to <HI>the&s;e</HI> under the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Town, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to determine whether they will have the Chance of 50, perhaps 60, 80, or 100, or even more for their Lives, or that of 6 to 1 for 'em. One they mu&s;t have.</P>
<P N="3">3. As this Di&s;temper is infectious, and pro|duces it &s;elf, &s;o the &s;everal Sorts of it produce them&s;elves: A favourable Sort produces a fa|vourable One; a malignant Sort a malignant One. This is certain in Inoculation, and very highly probable in the natural Way. As it advances, therefore the Kind will grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, for where the Infection is taken from different Per&s;ons (and as it advances this will be more and more the Ca&s;e) the Good can't correct the Bad, but the Bad will prevail over the Good. And here Experience con|firms
<PB N="6" REF="5">our Rea&s;oning, for it is ob&s;erveable, that agreeably to that, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is for the mo&s;t Part favourable at its fir&s;t coming into a Town, but as it &s;preads, grows more malig|nant. Now in the Ca&s;e of Inoculation, not above 1 in 50 has a bad Sort, perhaps not a|bove 1 in 60, 80, or 100 as was hinted be|fore. Inoculation therefore would be a great means to pre&s;erve the &s;ort good; &s;o that even tho&s;e who have it not by Inoculation will have a fairer Chance, but in the natural Way where at a Medium 1 in 6 die, at the Time of the Town's being mo&s;t infected 1 in 5, 4, or 3 may die: Nay perhaps more among grown Per&s;ons. At <HI>Uxbridge</HI> near <HI>London</HI> 51 died out of 140, which is &s;omething more than 1 in 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE la&s;t Rea&s;on is the general Good of Mankind. Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> has &s;hewn that at lea&s;t a 14^t^h part of Mankind die of the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and within the Bills of Mortality it de|&s;troys at a middle Reckoning con&s;iderably more than 2000 Per&s;ons Yearly as appears from them: But it is very probable that if Inoculation was generally practi&s;ed, we &s;hould arrive at &s;uch Perfection in it, that few or none would die. We have then a mo&s;t happy Opportu|nity of &s;erving Mankind at the &s;ame Time that we &s;erve our &s;elves. Indeed it is much to be feared, that Inoculation will never prevail, but by being introduced in &s;uch Ca&s;es, as ours is at pre&s;ent, where People are almo&s;t under a
<PB N="7" REF="6">nece&s;&s;ity of having it, and are only to chu&s;e whether they will have it in a more or le&s;s dangerous Way. If be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of &s;o ma|ny Lives we con&s;ider the Fears and Unea&s;ine&s;|&s;es of People for them&s;elves, of Parents, Chil|dren, Relations and Friends for them, their own Unea&s;ine&s;s at not being able to vi&s;it their Friends under this Di&s;temper, the Unfitne&s;s for Bu&s;ine&s;s which it lays many under, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one has &s;till greater Rea&s;on to wi&s;h that this was the general Practice in Children, from the Age of 2 or 3, to that of 7 or thereabouts. And when we call to mind the Indignation and Gon|tempt which we have for the Oppo&s;ers of Bark, Opium, and Mercury in Phy&s;ic, Reformations in Religion, the wi&s;e&s;t Laws in Government, or of any Thing el&s;e, which is Great and Good (and Oppo&s;ition has generally been the Fate of every &s;uch Thing, either out of Intere&s;t and Di&s;hone&s;ty, or Ignorance, Folly, and Super&s;ti|tion) it &s;hould make us &s;eriou&s;ly reflect what Cen&s;ures Po&s;terity may ju&s;tly pa&s;s upon us in the pre&s;ent Point.</P>
<P>THE Objections that are made to this Prac|tice are generally the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are not certain that Inoculation is a Security from having the Di&s;temper again.</P>
<P>THIS Objection may be an&s;wered thus. 1. Several Per&s;ons who have been inoculated, have been made to conver&s;e with, to handle, nur&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="7">lie in the &s;ame Bed with others &s;ick of the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and no one ever had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn. 2. Several Stories, that have been in|vented to per&s;wade the World of the Contrary have been detected, and &s;hewn to be Forgeries. 3. As the inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> is in every minute Circum&s;tance, exactly like the natural One, of the &s;ame Kind and Degree, it would be very extraordinary, and contrary to the whole Cour&s;e of Nature's proceedings in &s;uch Things, if it &s;hould not be like in this. What|ever be the Rea&s;on why the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> pre&s;erves us from future Infection, it is inconceiveable that the Inoculated &s;hould not do the &s;ame, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. Indeed if the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> e&s;pecially of a favoura|ble Sort, be not an ab&s;olute Security, which is the Opinion of &s;ome, neither can the Ino|culated be &s;uppo&s;ed to be: But this if True, yet is &s;o rare as not to de&s;erve Notice. I &s;up|po&s;e no one would de&s;ire a bad Sort, rather than a good One, for that rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">II. ANOTHER Objection to the Practice of Inoculation is, that the inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> often leaves bad Con&s;equences, as Con|&s;umptions, Boils, and Blotches, weak Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> is apt to leave the &s;ame Sort of ill Con&s;equences is known to every one; and yet there are Methods, which will for the mo&s;t Part entirely prevent or re|medy
<PB N="9" REF="8">them, and always do it in &s;ome degree. The Objection therefore to have its proper Force mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that Inocu|lation leaves more or wor&s;e Di&s;orders, than the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and in order to know whether this be &s;o or no, it will not be improper to enquire fir&s;t, what is the Rea&s;on of the&s;e Di&s;orders at all. In the Declen&s;ion of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> a Quantity of corrupted Matter returns in|to the Body, and mixes with the Blood; as is evident from the falling of the Face, Hands, and Feet which were before much &s;welled and inflamed: And tho' &s;uch be the excellent Contrivance of a human Body, that it converts Things of mo&s;t different Natures into Blood, proper for its Nouri&s;hment and U&s;es, as we daily &s;ee in the va&s;t variety of Things which all make healthful Food for Mankind, yet it cannot entirely overcome this corrupted Matter returning into the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o as to make <HI>that</HI> in all Things fit for the purpo&s;es of Life and Health, but &s;uffers from thence the &s;econdary Fever fir&s;t, then what Phy&s;icians call Ob&s;tructions and Acrimo|nies, in which la&s;t con&s;i&s;t the Di&s;orders abovementioned. One would haturally think therefore, that where the mo&s;t corrupted Matter, and of the wor&s;t Kind
<PB N="10" REF="9">returned into the Blood, there the Di&s;|orders &s;ucceeding the <HI>Small Pox</HI> &s;hould be mo&s;t and wor&s;t, and &s;o we general|ly find it; but then there are a great many Accidents happening in the Con|clu&s;ion of the Di&s;temper, which con|curring with the different Age, Con&s;titu|tion, manner of living, different Me|thods u&s;ed by different Phy&s;icians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> make &s;ometimes a malignant <HI>Small Pox,</HI> leave &s;ew ill con&s;equences, and a fa|vourable one leave many: And parti|cularly I think it is true that many who have the di&s;tinct Kind and &s;oon recover their u&s;ual Health to appearance, and often more than their u&s;ual Appetite, are &s;o defective in the Rules of Ab&s;ti|rence, and proper Phy&s;ic, as to fall into an ill Habit of Body &s;ome time after. Now that &s;omething like this has been the Ca&s;e with &s;everal that have been inoculated, is not at all improbable, &s;ince it is remarkable that in <HI>London</HI> great pains have been taken to per&s;wade People, that Inoculation neither wants Preparation be|fore, the Attendance of a Phy&s;ician du|ring the Di&s;temper, nor Care afterwards: but this affects not tho&s;e who will take Care afterwards. As was &s;aid in the 3d An&s;wer to the foregoing Objection,
<PB N="11" REF="10">it is inconceivable how the inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> &s;hould be like the Natural in the whole Progre&s;s of the Di&s;temper, and yet differ in this: And to be more par|ticular, it is inconceivable how a Quan|tity of corrupted Matter falling into the Body &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of the Di&s;|orders &s;ucceeding the <HI>Small Pox</HI> (a thing which all Phy&s;icians allow) and yet the inoculated <HI>Small Pox,</HI> where there is le&s;s of that Matter, and that of a more kindly Nature, be attended with wor&s;e Con&s;e|quences. Now when any Matter of Fact is &s;aid to contradict &s;uch plain Rea&s;oning as this is, one may be allowed to exa|mine &s;trictly into the Evidence for that Fact. Let us examine then. And fir&s;t it is altogether impracticable to make any E&s;timate of the ill Con&s;equences that at|tend the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and therefore in like manner impracticable to compare the Natural and Inoculated together in that Re|&s;pect. Then if any happen to &s;uffer after the Inoculated, it is immediately in every once Mouth and that with many Aggrav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tions. In the Natural we hear nothing of tho&s;e who tho' they e&s;cape with Life are yet &s;everely afflicted with the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;equences of it. In the Inoculated e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cept the Patient go through the whole St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="12" REF="11">of the Di&s;temper without any ill Symp|tom, and continue free from any after|wards, perhaps without due Care to make him &s;o as was &s;aid, we are &s;ure to have the mo&s;t made of it again&s;t the Practice. Nay there have been Ca&s;es, where Stories to di&s;credit it have been entirely invent|ed. One would wonder that there &s;hould be any, who tho' they may have Ba&s;ene&s;s enough to affirm what they know is fal&s;e, can yet be &s;o &s;tupid as to do it, when they are &s;ure they may and mu&s;t be de|tected and expo&s;ed. But I believe every ones own Experience will furni&s;h &s;ome In|&s;tance of it. There are Men in the World who love to triumph, be it only for a Week or a Day, even when they cannot but be convinced, all will then end in their own Confu&s;ion; and it is notorious that Inoculation has met with &s;ome &s;uch Op|po&s;ers, as may be &s;een in Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI>'s Ac|counts of it.</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer to this Objection then in &s;hort is this. It compares the ill Effects of the natural and moculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> together, affirming that tho&s;e of the la&s;t, are wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, but fails in the E&s;timate of both &s;ides of the Compa|ri&s;on. The E&s;timate of the fir&s;t can ne|ver
<PB N="13" REF="12">be had, and that of the la&s;t is gro&s;ly mi&s;-repre&s;ented. This Evidence therefore will never &s;upport a Po&s;ition &s;o contra|ry to all common Sen&s;e as this, <HI>viz.</HI> that where the Quantity of corrupted Matter returning into the Blood is le&s;s, and al&s;o le&s;s corrupted; there the ill Effects of it &s;hould be more &s;evere. I will here add what I had from Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> la&s;t <HI>April.</HI> He collected the Accounts of all (in Number 724) that were inoculated in <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> for &s;ome Years, during which he was Secretary to the ROYAL SOCIETY: And it mu&s;t be acknowledged he has done it with the utmo&s;t Impartiality. Upon my asking him what his real Opinion about the Practice was, and particularly whether the ill Con&s;equences that attend the in|oculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> were wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the Natural; he an&s;wered, that as far as he knew they were not, and that his real Opinion of Inoculation might ea&s;ily be known, becau&s;e he had ju&s;t inoculated one of his own Children.</P>
<P N="3">III. A third Objection is that by In|oculation we may communicate other Di&s;tempers.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>MOST chronical Di&s;tempers (that is &s;uch as are not Fevers) are chiefly owing to the irregular Make of the Ve&s;&s;els thro' which the Blood and Juices pa&s;s, and as Chil|dren often re&s;emble their Parents in the Features of the Face, &s;o they may re&s;em|ble them in the make of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, and by that means may have many Di&s;tempers hereditarily. Now if this was the Ca&s;e of all, it would be as ju&s;t to affirm that Inoculation could communicate the Fea|tures of another Man's Face, as commu|nicate other Di&s;tempers. But it mu&s;t be acknowledged that there are &s;everal which may be communicated by methods, no ways con&s;i&s;tent with this Account: It cannot therefore be univer&s;ally True. For in&s;tance, a Child receives its whole Su&s;ten|ance from the Milk which has circulated thro' the Body of a Nur&s;e, afflicted with &s;crophelous Complaints, and has them from her. Nay &s;ome are of Opinion, that lying much in the &s;ame Bed with People of di&s;|tempered Con&s;titutions is of bad Con&s;e|quence but no one is afraid of &s;uch In|fection in the ordinary Intercour&s;es of Life, and yet in them we continually receive by means of the Air which we breath, (per|haps by other means) &s;uch Particles as fly
<PB N="15" REF="14">from the Bodies of tho&s;e we conver&s;e with. This is the Method in which the <HI>Small Pox</HI> is Infectious, and he that will affirm that Inoculation gives other Di&s;tempers, will find it hard to prove that accidental Propagation will not do the &s;ame, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on; and that the common Inter|cour&s;es of Life &s;hould not much rather do the &s;ame, &s;ince there we often receive into our own Bodies greater Quantities from tho&s;e of others, than the Matter of In|oculation amounts to. There has been no In&s;tance of this Kind produced that ever I heard of. The infectious Matter according to Experience, appears to com|municate nothing but what it was intend|ed to communicate, the <HI>Small Pox.</HI> It was never pretended to have left an here|ditary Complaint, &s;uch as the Per&s;on from whence it was taken was afflicted with. And if all that has hitherto been advanced upon this Head &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, yet there are enough of the laborious Part of Mankind where we have moral Certainty, that they have &s;ound and healthy Con&s;ti|tutions. I am &s;ure no Parent would put put a Child out to a Nur&s;e but upon &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P N="4">IV. I come now to another Objection which is foreign to me as a Phy&s;ician, but belongs to us all as Men. In this Capa|city I have a &s;trict Obligation not to mi&s;|take my Duty, and therefore a &s;ufficient Right to enquire: This then is my Apo|logy for doing &s;o here. The Objection is that the Practice is &s;inful: That is, that a Practice which would re&s;tore Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Means of living to ma|ny, who now want it, which would &s;ave great numbers of Lives, and which might be of fingular Service to all Mankind, by either promoting or di&s;couraging its far|ther Progre&s;s, is a thing forbidden us by infinite Goodne&s;s, who &s;ent us here to imi|tate his own Perfections, and that mo&s;t e&s;pecially in doing good. At fir&s;t &s;ight this &s;eems to be a very incon&s;i&s;tent and un|amiable Repre&s;entation of the Parent and Governor of the World, &s;uch a one as would be unworthy of an earthly Father, or a wi&s;e and beneficent Magi&s;trate. At fir&s;t &s;ight it &s;eems, that if all, or the principal Part of what is here offered be true, this Objection mu&s;t fall to the Ground of Cour&s;e. But perhaps in another View of things it may appear otherwi&s;e. The Objectors &s;ay then that it is &s;inful to en|danger
<PB N="17" REF="16">our Lives voluntarily. Be it &s;o. Con&s;ider now 50 Per&s;ons in this Town who have not had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and let us &s;uppo&s;e that 2 e&s;cape and 48 have it, or that 8 e&s;cape and 42 have it, or that 14 e&s;cape and 36 have it, or that 20 e&s;cape and 50 have it, or la&s;tly that 26 e&s;cape and 24 have it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Ca&s;e according to the Hazard above given of the natural <HI>Small Pox</HI> (that of 1 in 6) 8 will die, in the 2d 7, in the 3d 6, in the 4th 5, and in the la&s;t 4; for the 6th Parts of the Num|bers 48, 42, 36, 30, 24 are 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>HE therefore who waits for the na|tural <HI>Small Pox</HI> runs the Hazard of 4 in 50, even &s;uppo&s;ing the Hopes that he has to e&s;cape to be more than an equal Chance, which can never be true. He that tries Inoculation has only the Haz|ard of 1 in 50. If therefore to incur the Danger of Life voluntarily be a Sin, it is a greater Sin to incur a greater Danger, a le&s;s Sin to do incur a le&s;s Danger, that is, it is a Sin to do the Fir&s;t, and our Doty to do the La&s;t. But &s;ay they again, the natural and inoculated <HI>Small Pox</HI> are
<PB N="18" REF="17">not equally voluntarily; God brings one upon us, the other is our own do|ing. What does God confine Men and their Families in the Town? No; but their Affairs and Fortunes do. Shall then a Man for that rea&s;on &s;tand the Hazard of 4 in 50, and not take the le&s;s Hazard of 1 in 50, to avoid the greater of 4 in 50? And as Men endanger their Lives voluntarily in the pre&s;ent Situation of the Town by &s;taying in it, &s;o they do, and mu&s;t and ought to do it, by the Voy|ages and Journeys they daily make, the Phy&s;ic they &s;ometimes take, and the ma|ny Handicraft Trades pernicious to Health which are practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid that we are to tru&s;t in Providence, the An&s;wer is, that Provi|dence has given us Heads and Hands to contrive and execute what is mo&s;t for our Advantage: And to neglect to u&s;e them for that Purpo&s;e, is not to tru&s;t in Providence, but to be pre&s;umptuous and ungrateful. To tru&s;t in Providence is to do all we can for our &s;elves, and then to believe we &s;hall be taken care of. But to believe &s;o, till we have fir&s;t done that, is Pre&s;umption. It is affirming that all Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t &s;top, Mankind &s;it &s;till

<P>A tender Parent &s;ays, I &s;hall never for|give my &s;elf, if my Child &s;hould die of the inoculated <HI>Small Pox,</HI> that I did not &s;tand the Hazard of the Natural. But for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing the Haz|ards equal, a tender Parent ought to &s;ay, I &s;hall never forgive my &s;elf if my Child &s;hould die of the natural <HI>Small Pox,</HI> that I did not try Inoculation. And if the Hazards be unequal, what is a tender Parent to &s;ay then? If particularly the Hazard of the Natural be more than that of 1 in 6, that of the Inoculated le&s;s than that of 1 in 50, the Hopes of e&s;cap|ing the Di&s;temper in Children not 1 in 100, and the ill Con&s;equences of the In|oculated con&s;iderably milder than that of the Natural; all which Suppo&s;itions in my Opinion are very probable. What would a tender Parent give to have a Child alive again, to try the Chance of Inoculation?</P>
