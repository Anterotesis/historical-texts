<HEAD>GENTLEMEN and LADIES,</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN a <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> puts out a Book upon any Di&s;tem|per incident to human Bo|dy, he is <HI>hugely</HI> careful to ob&s;erve the following Method: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in the Pre|&s;ace to his Book, he very cunningly and artf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly pre|pares his Bait, and fixes his Trap, by a long Declaration of his good Intentions to &s;erve the Publick; and that the following Treati&s;e is publi&s;h'd with that View only, and with|out any private <HI>Ends</HI> or &s;elfi&s;h <HI>De&s;igns</HI> as <HI>Quacks</HI> u&s;ually have: In the Body of the Book he affords you mo&s;t delightful Entertainment, by Rea&s;oning &s;o finely upon the Variety of its Cau&s;es, and &s;etting forth in a mo&s;t ample Man|ner, both the <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern</HI> Methods of Cure; and in the End he is almo&s;t &s;ure to catch his <HI>Prey</HI> by a <HI>&s;ly</HI> In&s;inuation of the wonderful Succe&s;s he him&s;elf has had in the Cure of that Di&s;temper, by a Method entire|ly <HI>new,</HI> and <HI>unknown</HI> to any but him&s;elf; Now 'tis certain this is no more than a lar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

<L><HI>Who cures the Pl&mdash;e indeed and ind&mdash;d.</HI></L>
<L>Or,</L>
<L><HI>IS&mdash;l M&mdash;l born and bred in this Nation,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can cure the Small-Pox without Inoculation.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>THE difference therefore in this Point be|tween the <HI>Regular</HI> and <HI>Quack</HI> Phy&s;ician con|&s;i&s;ts only in the former's making you pay largely for his Adverti&s;ement and Phy&s;ick too; whil&s;t the latter is obliged to give away his Adverti&s;ement, and Perhaps is never half paid for his Phy&s;ick: But this I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, That both of them &s;till agree in the Con|cealment of their Methods, and would by no means di&s;cover them, no not for <HI>Five Hun|dred Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>THAT there are many Phy&s;ical Druggs and Plants yet undi&s;covered to the World, who&s;e effects may be very conducive towards the continuation of Health and long Life, I be|lieve is the Opinion of mo&s;t Men; and that there are many <HI>Secrets</HI> or <HI>No&s;trums</HI> now in the Hands of particular Per&s;ons which are known to work &s;urprizing Cures is certain and without dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t and the Rea&s;on why they do now, and will &s;till remain <HI>Secrets,</HI> and in pri|vate Hands, is for want of a <HI>Public</HI> Reward
<PB N="5" REF="4">being offer'd, equal to the Advantage a pri|vate Man may make of them.</P>
<P>IN other Countries, I find, the <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Go|vernment</HI> is generally the Purcha&s;er of &s;uch <HI>Secrets,</HI> and then generou&s;ly publi&s;h them for the Good of all their Subjects; a piece of <HI>Policy,</HI> in my Opinion, in no wi&s;e contempti|ble, and what can never be a dear Purcha&s;e or hard Bargain to a <HI>Crown'd Head</HI> or <HI>Go|vernment.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our <HI>Countrymen</HI> either having <HI>le&s;s Money,</HI> or <HI>more Frugality,</HI> go a cheaper way to work, and oblige their Authors and Inven|tors either to run the Hazard of having their <HI>Secrets</HI> by &s;ome Accident or other di&s;covered to the World, or to purcha&s;e a <HI>Patent</HI> under the Great Seal, for the Sole making, u&s;ing or vending &s;uch a Machine, Preparation or Com|medity, (of which the Patentee has prov'd him&s;elf the Original Author and Inventor) for a certain term of Years, on condition that he then publi&s;hes it to the World; a &s;ure way of &s;aving their own Money, whatever the Sub|jects may &s;uffer in the mean time for want of &s;uch a Publication: Be&s;ides, all Men are not able to purcha&s;e a <HI>Patent,</HI> which will co&s;t no le&s;s than Sol. with an infinite deal of trouble to follow it through the various Offices to get it confirmed.</P>
<P>Now for a Man to be a <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Se|crets,</HI> and not to be placed in &s;uch a Station
<PB N="6" REF="5">as may Capacitate him to make a private Advantage of them, nor able to purcha&s;e a Patent, what has he el&s;e to do but make an <HI>Hone&s;t Publication</HI> of them, and leave the Con&s;equence to the <HI>Genero&s;ity</HI> of the World; in compliance wherewith I take this Oppor|tunity of publi&s;hing &s;ome curious and u&s;eful Preparations and Remedies as may be of uni|ver&s;al Advantage, nay I may &s;afely &s;ay, that there are but &s;ew Families who&s;e common Contingencies will not furni&s;h them with Op|portunities of experiencing many, if not mo&s;t of them, in le&s;s than the Space of one Annu|al Circumvolution; and as a Proof of the Truth of what I have hereafter offered, I will be always ready, not only to perform the Experimental Part of any, but likewi&s;e ac|count for the other Preparations herein con|tained, to Per&s;ons of all or any Denominati|ons, that will ordinarily &s;atisfie for &s;uch Trou|ble.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Vomit</HI> herein di&s;covered by far exceeds the Hypecacuana, (which co&s;ts the late King of <HI>France</HI> no le&s;s than 1500 Pi&s;tols) both for the certainty and ea&s;ine&s;s of its Operation, as well as tho&s;e other good Effects which it generally produces; and what renders it &s;till more valuable is its readine&s;s to be come at, both in all Places and at all Times, it being a Root growing in mo&s;t Yards and Gardens, and never, as I have yet &s;een, mentioned or
<PB N="7" REF="6">accounted for by any Author: At Nantwytch in Che&s;hire lives a Per&s;on who has acquired a large E&s;tate by vertue of this incomparable <HI>Vomit</HI> only.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fryars Vulnerary Ball,</HI> heals almo&s;t an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wound at the fir&s;t intention, as is demon|&s;trated by &s;triking a Nail through a <HI>Cock's Head,</HI> and nailing him down to your Table: which Wound is cured by the immediate u&s;e of this Ball in le&s;s than Ten Minutes time, and your Cock appears as well and brisk as ever.</P>
<P>THE famous <HI>Stiptick</HI> with which Sir <HI>Wil|liam Read</HI> performed &s;o many wonderful Cures, both <HI>outwardly</HI> and <HI>inwardly,</HI> is what I have very often experienc'd, and don't re|member it has ever once failed, it is a very ea&s;v and very cheap Preparation, and what no Family ought to be without.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Imperial Snuff</HI> is a very valuable Re|medy, and will &s;eldome if ever be found to fail in giving Ea&s;e in the mo&s;t violent Pains of the Head, tho' of long &s;tanding; great Care mu&s;t be taken that the Patient does not catch Cold: This grows in many Gardens, and is not very difficult to come at</P>
<P>THE <HI>Receipt</HI> which I have here given you for the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> is what I have often wi&s;h'd to have &s;een publi&s;h'd, becau&s;e of its &s;urpri|zing good Effects in the wor&s;t Symptoms of the mo&s;t dangerous kind; this I had from a
<PB N="8" REF="7">very noted <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> who told me it very rarely, if ever, failed of Succe&s;s. I had a Son about nine Years old &s;eized with the wor&s;t &s;ort of the Confluent Kind of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> intermixt with the <HI>Purples,</HI> for whom I had the Advice of two eminent Phy|&s;icians in <HI>London,</HI> notwith&s;tanding who&s;e Skill and Care he died on the fourteenth Day; about three Weeks after, another Son of four Years old fell down with the &s;ame dangerous Confluent Kind, and very full of the Purples, and then it was I fir&s;t heard of this notable Receipt, which had ju&s;t recovered a Neigh|bour's Child; I was per&s;waded to u&s;e this, and to de&s;i&s;t from &s;ending for a Phy&s;ician, and by God's Ble&s;&s;ing it happily recovered my Child, in a Condition perhaps as bad as ever was &s;een; and I do verily believe it would have had the &s;ame Effect upon the other, had I but then known and u&s;ed it; and tho I be|lieve it impo&s;&s;ible to contrive an <HI>univer&s;al Re|medy</HI> in the Small-Pox, yet I am apt to think this Drink will do more good, and pre&s;erve more lives than their <HI>new fangled</HI> and <HI>unju&s;ti|fiable</HI> way of <HI>Inoculation: Unju&s;tifiable</HI> I call it, becau&s;e be the Practice never &s;o laudable in &s;ome particular and far di&s;tant Places, yet no one can ju&s;tify it in the middle of a large and populous Town, any more than a Man can ju&s;tify the &s;etting <HI>Fire</HI> to his own Hou&s;e in the middle of a thick and clo&s;e built Neighbour|hood;
<PB N="9" REF="8">nay 'tis certain, that by a parity of Rea&s;on, both the <HI>Inoculator</HI> and the <HI>Inocu|lated</HI> are liable to the &s;ame Pro&s;ecution with <HI>Highwaymen,</HI> who often &s;uffer the Law when they have not actually robb'd a Man, but only for putting him in <HI>Bodily Fear,</HI> and the&s;e not only put whole Towns in <HI>Bodily Fears,</HI> but oftentimes prove the occa&s;ion of the <HI>Death</HI> of many, which whether to call <HI>Man&s;laughter</HI> or <HI>Murder</HI> I leave the World to judge.</P>
<P>IF therefore &s;ome Men will be &s;o hardy as to venture upon &s;uch an uncertain Practice, they ought at their own Co&s;t and Charge to erect a <HI>Lazoretto</HI> or <HI>Bedlam,</HI> at &s;ome conve|nient di&s;tance from a <HI>Town,</HI> and not near a <HI>Highway,</HI> and appoint Phy&s;icians and Surge|ons, who are mo&s;t zealous for &s;uch Practice, con|&s;tantly to re&s;ide there for the Reception and Care of &s;uch <HI>Mad</HI> People as would either come them&s;elves, or &s;end their Children; and not infect whole <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Countries</HI> as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the Con&s;equence of their Pub|lick Practice. I can't under&s;tand from the be&s;t Information I have been yet able to get, that this have ever been the Practice of any <HI>Chri|&s;tian Countries,</HI> but u&s;ed only among the <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI> who hearing of our Ripene&s;s for <HI>Infidelity,</HI> made a Pre&s;ent to us of this Cu|&s;tom by the Hands of a <HI>Scotchman;</HI> and this I believe may be depended on, That the near|er
<PB N="10" REF="9">we approach to <HI>Infidelity,</HI> the more will their Cu&s;toms flow in upon us; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>MANY other good Receipts and Directions you'll find in this &s;mall Book, which I gene|rou&s;ly publi&s;h for the Benefit of Mankind in general, and hope the World will readily ac|cept of, at a Price &s;o &s;mall, that it is hardly &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Charge and Trouble of Printing and Publi&s;hing, but will be a means to introduce it into a greater number of Fa|milies, and prevent the copying out any of the Receipts herein contained.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Generous Di&s;covery,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Life is generally begun in <HI>Tears,</HI> continued in <HI>Unea&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and ended in <HI>Groans;</HI> and as Children are &s;ubject to vari|ous Di&s;ea&s;es while they are yet in their Mo|thers Womb, and frequentl make their fir&s;t Appearances with them, &s;o I &s;hall begin with them fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IT was the Practice of the late Sir <HI>David Hamilton,</HI> a famous Man-Midwife in <HI>London,</HI> to Vomit Children &s;oon after they were born; and this was chiefly done to prevent &s;ore Mouths, which otherwi&s;e too frequently hap|pen, and grievou&s;ly torment the poor Infants; But &s;ince Nur&s;es are generally capable of ma|naging that Di&s;order, I need not &s;ay any
<PB N="11" REF="10">thing more concerning it, nor do I think it an ea&s;y matter to per&s;wade People to Vomit their Children, though nothing is more agree|able to their Flegmatic Con&s;titutions, which almo&s;t immediately turns every thing &s;our, and then coagulates, and makes Tough Flegm, which is generally the cau&s;e of Stop|pages, by which many are thrown into Con|vul&s;ions, and &s;o die. Two or three Tea Spoon|fuls of the incomparable Vomit I have here|after di&s;covered, &s;weetned with a little Su|gar, will operate as kindly, nay with more ea&s;e and as much &s;afety as a larger Proportion for an adult Per&s;on.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For the GRIPES.</HEAD>
<P>THE next Di&s;order which frequently ari&s;e in Children is from the Gripes, and the&s;e proceed from a violent &s;harp Humour in the Bowels, for which two or three Tea Spoon|fulls of the following Mixture, well &s;haken, ought to be given two or three times in a Day.</P>
<P><HI>Crabs Eyes half a Drachm, Syrup of Ro&s;es &s;olutive one Ounce, Black Cherry Water one Ounce, mix.</HI></P>
<P>This will both ab&s;orb the Acidity and carry off the Humours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For the RICKETS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rickets claim the next Place among Childrens Di&s;ea&s;es, the cau&s;e of which is from vi&s;cid pituitous Humours lodg'd upon
<PB N="12" REF="11">the Joints, occa&s;ioning an unequal circulation and di&s;tribution of the Fluids to the Parts be|yond; therefore &s;uch Medicines as will at|tenuate and thin the Blood, and make it &s;ub|tle enough to circulate through the &s;malle&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, mu&s;t by a continued u&s;e not only break its Sizy State, but di&s;lodge tough Humours already fixed upon the Joints; for this let the Child take Morning and Evening for a Con&s;tancy, avoiding all acid or &s;harp things, 2 or 3 Drops more or le&s;s according to the Age, Strength, and Con&s;titution of the Child, in a Spoonfull of <HI>Black Cherry Water,</HI> either of <HI>Sal Volatile,</HI> or <HI>Spirits of Harts|horn,</HI> anointing the Spine or Backbone of the Child with the <HI>Gall of an Ox;</HI> a Secret which the Lady <HI>Moor</HI> for a long while had, and gave away to the Poor, and which alone have cured hundreds of Ricketty Children.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>For WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS are the Medicines which will certainly de&s;troy tho&s;e pernicious Vermin, the only difficulty is to contrive them into Forms as Children may not too &s;oon be tired of taking; the&s;e are generally bred from a putrid Slime in their Bowels, which both hardens the Belly, and gives a &s;tinking Scent to the Breath. The following are certain Remedies, if Children can but be per&s;waded to take them.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P><HI>Take Tin, Coral, and Worm&s;eed, all in Powder, of each one Ounce, Savin und Saf|fron Powder, of each one Drachm, mix.</HI></P>

<P>Or,</P>
<P><HI>Aethiops Mineral,</HI> which is made of equal Parts of <HI>Crude Mercury</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> rubb'd in a Mortar till they become exceeding black, and may be given from ten to twenty Grains, according to the Age of the Child. The&s;e are Infallible, but in all Childrens Medicines the greate&s;t Nicety con&s;i&s;ts in the clo&s;e&s;ts con|cealment.</P>

<P>THIS is the Receipt, as delivered to me and &s;everal others; and whatever fault &s;ome Carping Phy&s;icians and Stiff Apothecaries may find with the manner of it, yet Experience tells me, and many be&s;ides me, that there is no one now extant to be compared with it; and I defy any of the afore&s;aid to equal or come near it as a general good Remedy in the Small-Pox.</P>

A Woman of about 60 Years of Age took but twice of it, and it purged or &s;alivated her Head for a whole Fortnight, and effectually cured her of the Head-Ach, without which &s;he had not been for &s;even Years before.

<P>THIS is a very <HI>curious</HI> and <HI>&s;urprizing</HI> Ex|periment, and will &s;erve to light a <HI>Pipe</HI> or a <HI>piece</HI> of <HI>Paper</HI> in the Field when Gentle|men are Sporting: This is the true manner of making it, which I will readily &s;hew to any Gentleman; but it is of no u&s;e in Phy&s;ic.</P>

<HEAD>To make STARCH from Potatoes.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Pare your Potatoes and grate them upon a large clean Grater as you do Bread, and let them fall into a fine lawn Sieve, placed in a clean Ba&s;on half full of Water, and the Starch will &s;ink down to the bottom; wa&s;h it with two or three Waters, and then gently dry it between two Papers.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>fine&s;t</HI> and <HI>white&s;t</HI> Starch in the World, and will go further than any o|ther; and any one may make it for <HI>private u&s;e.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Take one Hundred Walnuts ju&s;t before they begin to be fit for pickling, brui&s;e them well, and put them into a Pot, with a Quart of the be&s;t White Wine Vinegar, and a good handful of Salt, let them &s;tand about twenty four Hours, and then pre&s;s out the Liquor, and Bottle it for u&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>LET it &s;tand 3 or 4 Months before it be u&s;ed, and when you u&s;e it &s;hake the Bottle, and one Spoonful or two will not only thick|en, but add a mo&s;t <HI>grateful</HI> Flavour to the Sauce; and is not at all inferior to the <HI>Fo|reign</HI> Ketchup of &s;even Shillings a Pint, made of we know not what.</P>

<HEAD>Of Di&s;tempers more peculiarly incident to the FEMALE SEX.</HEAD>
<P>How <HI>Wretched</HI> and <HI>Unhappy</HI> (&s;ays the Great Dr. <HI>Friend</HI>) are the Circum&s;tances of the Female Sex, who are yet appointed to be the <HI>Storehou&s;es</HI> of Human Kind; for let them choo&s;e what State or Condition of Life they will, <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> will attend them; If they choo&s;e the Married State, then forthwith comes on the Fatigue and Danger of Child|bearing; if they choo&s;e a <HI>Maiden</HI> Life, they are &s;ubject to various Di&s;orders, which a <HI>Mar|ried</HI> State would probably have freed them from.</P>
