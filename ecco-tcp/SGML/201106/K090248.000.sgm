<P>THE numerous favours which, during a re&s;idence of five years in Oxford, I have received from you, will, I hope, ju&s;tify the propriety of this dedication; and make that, which otherwi&s;e would appear an act of the highe&s;t pre&s;umption in me, con&s;idered as a &s;mall tribute of my gratitude and re&s;pect.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
<P>Though I might be ju&s;tly ac|cu&s;ed of a vanity nearly allied to the extravagance of folly, &s;hould I pre|&s;ume to think that I had a de&s;erved claim to your attention and peru&s;al of the following pages, either from the merit of their author, or from their own intrin&s;ic value, yet I can|not but hope for your favourable acceptance of them, when I con|&s;ider how nearly connected the &s;ub|ject of this treati&s;e is, not only with the nece&s;&s;ary regard which ought to be paid to that mo&s;t valuable of all earthly ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;ublunary po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, health, but al&s;o with the objects of your pre&s;ent pur&s;uits at the Univer&s;ity, and with your future connections with &s;ociety in general. For give me leave (not improperly or ludicrou&s;ly) to ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="v" REF="5">however ample and exten&s;ive the boundaries of your pre&s;ent &s;tudies may be, that a&s;&s;i&s;tance is certainly requi&s;ite which can promote and facilitate the communication of them to the world. The oratory of the pulpit and the bar, with regard to its excellence, depends greatly on the pre&s;ervation of the teeth; the teeth, which form the regular pro|nunciation of the voice, and pre|vent, in a great mea&s;ure, all impe|diments and ob&s;tructions of the &s;peech.</P>
<P>I could here dwell on the con|veniences that attend the pre&s;erva|tion of the teeth in private life: the ea&s;e in ma&s;tication, and the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which it gives to the mixture of our food with the &s;alivary liquors,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">which mixture is nece&s;&s;ary towards dige&s;tion: the air of floridity and youth, which it imparts to the com|plexion, and the prevention of all offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable humours, which would otherwi&s;e grow in the mouth and gums.&mdash;But I &s;hall re|&s;erve the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e points to the proper places in which they will be ranged in the following pages.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE TEETH.</HEAD>
<P>THE complaint which generally attends the execution of a work of this kind &s;eems to be, that the author, being puffed up with a vain conceit and opinion of his own abilities and con&s;equence, takes too frequent and unnece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions of introducing in his writings technical terms, and ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions of the art; making that, which profe&s;&s;edly undertakes in a clear and &s;imple manner to treat of the di&s;orders incidental to the teeth, and the remedial applications nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a work of laborious inquiry, and a mere di&s;play of anatomical
<PB N="10" REF="9">knowledge. This error I will endeavour cautiou&s;ly to avoid; as well, becau&s;e the natural hi&s;tory and anatomical &s;tructure of the teeth have been explained and amply treated of in &s;ome late very ingenious and elaborate treati&s;es (tho&s;e I mean written by Mr. John Hunter, F. R. S. and &s;urgeon to St. George's Ho&s;pital; and Mr. Beard|more, &s;urgeon denti&s;t in ordinary to his Maje&s;ty) as becau&s;e I &s;hould be too circum|&s;cribed in &s;uch an attempt by the limits of the&s;e pages: &s;uch an attempt requiring more time and lei&s;ure thoroughly to fini&s;h than I could be able to &s;ecure from my ne|ce&s;&s;ary avocations of bu&s;ine&s;s. I therefore beg leave to recommend the treati&s;es above mentioned, from the peru&s;al of which I have received great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, to tho&s;e, who&s;e curio&s;ity or profe&s;&s;ion lead them to attend to the <HI>minutiae</HI> of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign is merely to give a plain and brief account of the teeth, the compaints they are &s;ubject to, and the methods of cure; omitting nothing, I hope, which is
<PB N="11" REF="10">nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and avoiding all ob&s;curities of &s;tile and meaning. The &s;ub|ject has been already amply and copiou&s;ly treated of, and I have not the vanity to think that I &s;hall be able to &s;et it, or any branch of it, in a new or more in&s;tructive point of view.</P>
<P>The teeth are hard &s;ub&s;tances of bone and enamel growing in the cavities of the upper and lower jaw. The&s;e cavities anatomi&s;ts call the <HI>alveoli,</HI> which have circular pro|ce&s;&s;es embracing the body of the tooth with great clo&s;ene&s;s, and thereby are to be con|&s;idered as principal &s;upports of the teeth.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>alveolar proce&s;&s;es</HI> are covered by a compact ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance or fle&s;hy cove|ring, called the <HI>gums;</HI> which covering ad|hering firmly to the <HI>alveolar proce&s;&s;es</HI> inve&s;ts and contains the teeth firm in their &s;ock|ets: and are be&s;ides an admirable protec|tion for them again&s;t the injuries they might receive from an expo&s;ure to the air and cold, and from the occa&s;ional pre&s;&s;ure of our food again&s;t the thin membrane which covers them. The circular ridge
<PB N="12" REF="11">which &s;eparates and di&s;tingui&s;hes the body and roots, or fangs of the teeth, and to which the gums grow up, and are clo&s;ely attached, is called the neck or collar of the tooth. The fangs or roots are tho&s;e parts which are hid from our &s;ight in the &s;ockets: they are covered with a thin va&s;cular membrane, called the <HI>perio&s;taeum,</HI> which unites them firmly to the jaw. The inner &s;ub&s;tance of the tooth is the bone, having an internal cavity, which extends nearly the whole length of the tooth; be|ginning at the point of the root or fang, and ending in the body of the tooth. This cavity is well &s;upplied with nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els, which nouri&s;h the teeth, pro|mote their growth; and when &s;ubject to any di&s;order or ob&s;truction, are the &s;eat of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations of pain. The enamel grows only on, and &s;urrounds the body of the tooth. It is a very white and &s;moothly poli&s;hed &s;ub&s;tance, of a degree of hardne&s;s &s;o great, as to be impenetrable to our keene&s;t in&s;truments: in cutting or di|viding it therefore, we are obliged to u&s;e files, and even tho&s;e mu&s;t be &s;kilfully u&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="12">by the operators, to prevent any damage being given to the remaining poli&s;h of the enamel.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;hape</HI> of the teeth being within the immediate extent of every one's own knowledge, I &s;hall not here make mention of it. Their <HI>number</HI> is uncertain; though I believe they rarely exceed thirty. Mr. Hunter &s;ays, that he once &s;aw only twenty|&s;even, but never more than thirty-two; and makes thereupon this very &s;en&s;ible re|mark, "That where the number is le&s;s than thirty-two, the deficiency is in the la&s;t grinder."&mdash;This is, however (I mean the number of teeth in a full &s;ubject) a point of mere curio&s;ity; &s;ince during the cour&s;e of my practice, I never could di&s;cover any difference in the formation or &s;tructure of them, whether more or le&s;s in number: but they all equally as well perform their u&s;ual functions, and an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which they are de&s;igned. The number is not certain, I think, for this rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that if it were, when the jaw bone
<PB N="14" REF="13">of a man is enlarged, and grows in propor|tion to the increa&s;e of his age, we do not find any difference in the <HI>alveolar &s;paces,</HI> either with regard to their number or ex|ten&s;ion, which would otherwi&s;e undoub|tedly happen in the ca&s;e between a man, who in his perfect &s;tate, had thirty two teeth, and of another, who had only thirty.</P>
<P>The above is a brief de&s;cription of the &s;ituation and &s;tructure of the teeth: the formation of them is curious and particular, which I will endeavour to give as &s;atis|factory and conci&s;e an account of, as the limits of this work will permit.</P>
<P>The contents of the <HI>alveoli,</HI> or cavities in the jaw, in which the teeth grow; are at almo&s;t the earlie&s;t &s;tate of infancy, &s;ome little &s;oft pulpy &s;ub&s;tances which are attached to the bottom of the &s;ockets by a nervous filament, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els diffu&s;e them&s;elves through the pulpy &s;ub&s;tances, and the thin membrane that covers them.
<PB N="15" REF="14">Nouri&s;hment is hereby conveyed to the&s;e pulpy &s;ub&s;tances, which, as the child in|crea&s;es in age, begin gradually to o&s;&s;ify, and advance higher and higher from the &s;ockets. The tooth is yet imperfectly formed, not having gained any degree of &s;trength and rigidity. By degrees they begin to pre&s;s again&s;t the gums, which, by con&s;tant attrition are inflamed and affected with redne&s;s and &s;welling, and occa&s;ion great pain and unea&s;ine&s;s to the infant. What is called <HI>the cutting of the teeth</HI> now begins, which is a violent effort of nature to pierce through the confinement of the gums, where the teeth have undergone the &s;tate of formation and o&s;&s;ification, and to appear above the &s;ockets. As this opera|tion of nature is attended with great and continued pain to the child, and frequently not fini&s;hed without the hazard of much danger, it has been a matter of &s;urprize to &s;ome gentlemen of eminence in &s;urgery. that a new and more expeditious method has not been introduced to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cutting of the teeth, and that the efforts and endea|vours
<PB N="16" REF="15">of nature have not been, as in almo&s;t all other ca&s;es, promoted by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art. Tho&s;e gentlemen have thought, and with great appearance of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, that no danger or inconvenience would attend the opening of the gums at the particular time of the fir&s;t appearance of dentition, with an in&s;trument, and thereby, by making a way for the teeth to rai&s;e them&s;elves from the &s;ockets to pre|vent the &s;low advances of nature. The in|&s;trument certainly mu&s;t be managed with a nice and &s;kilful hand; or it may, by pene|trating too deep, do much harm and da|mage to the tooth it&s;elf, not yet &s;ufficiently hardened. I cannot &s;ugge&s;t to my&s;elf any plau&s;ible objection to the propriety and ex|pediency of this plan; however, I willingly &s;ubmit this opinion to the judgments of tho&s;e gentlemen, who claim a &s;uperior knowledge in this point, from their atten|dance upon children in their infancy; my practice having been chiefly confined to the care of the teeth in their full grown and perfect &s;tate.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P>Anatomi&s;ts divide the teeth into three cla&s;&s;es; <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> or cutting teeth, the <HI>canini,</HI> or canine teeth, and the <HI>molares</HI> or Grinders: the fir&s;t cla&s;s including the four anterior teeth; the &s;econd including the two next, one on each &s;ide, called the <HI>canine teeth,</HI> from the &s;imilarity and re&s;em|blance they bear to the teeth of dogs; and the third including the re&s;t. For a particular de&s;cription of which, I beg leave to refer the curious reader to Mr. Hunter's late treati&s;e, which I mentioned before, where he will receive every degree of intelligence and &s;atisfaction to his inquiries. I do not here take &s;o much notice of them, as perhaps &s;ome people may think I ought; as their &s;ituation and parts are pretty univer&s;ally marked out to every one's knowledge, and all that could be &s;aid would amount only to &s;ome comparative remarks on their diffe|rent degrees of prominence, thickne&s;s, or other inherent properties.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly treated of the forma|tion and &s;tructure of the teeth, the third
<PB N="18" REF="17">propo&s;ed point, <HI>viz. their u&s;e,</HI> comes under our con&s;ideration. This, though already apppearing &s;ufficiently clear and compre|hen&s;ive, may be thought to &s;tand in need of no farther explanatory elucidation; but really the pre&s;ervation and care of the teeth being a matter of no &s;mall con&s;equence, indeed of much greater importance than the generality of mankind &s;eem from their indolence and inattention to them to &s;u&s;|pect, I beg leave to be indulged in a few words. The teeth are parts which will &s;ooner decay and become di&s;ordered through neglect, than any other parts of our Frame; and, when di&s;ordered, occa&s;ion greater pain, and introduce a greater variety of other complaints than can be conjectured upon ca&s;ual con&s;ideration. An enumera|tion of the benefits ari&s;ing from their <HI>perfect</HI> &s;tate may therefore make us more attentive to them, and more de&s;irous of avoiding the numerous train of inconveniences and di&s;or|ders we &s;hall feel upon their decay and <HI>im|perfect</HI> &s;tate.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>The mo&s;t common and principal u&s;es which we find to re&s;ult from the growth and perfection of the teeth, are the a&s;&s;i&s;tances they give us in ma&s;tication, and in &s;peech. I &s;peak from the common experience which every one mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of, when I mention the painful and unplea&s;ant operation of chewing our food, at a time when any accident or di&s;order has deprived us of the temporary or entire lo&s;s of our teeth, not to mention any phy|&s;ical rea&s;ons of the harm it may do our con&s;titution, when the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the food we eat requires to promote its &s;peedy mixture with the &s;alivary liquor, facilitating thereby its pa&s;&s;age into the &s;tomach, and occa&s;ioning a plea&s;ant and &s;afe dige&s;tion, is lo&s;t or impaired. Another inconvenience will ari&s;e in this ca&s;e, from the continual pre&s;&s;ure of our food again&s;t the gums, which may irritate and inflame them; occa&s;ioning, thereby, &s;orene&s;s and &s;wellings.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="19">
<P><HI>In &s;peech,</HI> we all know the well timed, and regular aid, which the teeth in their perfect &s;tate give to our voice and pronuncia|tion; and, by con&s;equence, the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice they are of to the &s;tudy and practice of oratory in public life; where the form of the Engli&s;h government and con&s;titution, the elevated rank and e&s;teem in which the liberal profe&s;&s;ions are held, and the reputa|tion and fa&s;hionable celebrity which <HI>public &s;peaking</HI> claims, give the happie&s;t opportu|nities for eloquence to di&s;play her powers, and engage and captivate the attention of the large&s;t a&s;&s;emblies: and in private life, where a graceful and elegant addre&s;s are no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to attach us to the good opinion and favour of our neighbours, who would not be &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;o favourable an im|pre&s;&s;ion in our behalf, by an imperfect and broken voice, and a difficulty of expre&s;&s;ing our &s;entiments with fluency, and facility; which I affirm, will be the ca&s;e in a di&s;or|dered and rotten &s;tate of the teeth. The tongue, indeed, modifies the voice, and gives it different forms, but I cannot help
<PB N="21" REF="20">being &s;eriou&s;ly of opinion, that the various graces of pronunciation ari&s;e from the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the teeth; I mean according to the propul&s;ion of the tongue again&s;t the teeth, which detains or tran&s;mits the &s;ounds at plea&s;ure. This is, indeed, too curious, and indeed too philo&s;ophical an argument to be attended too in this &s;hort treati&s;e, nor is it at all of con&s;equence in common ob&s;er|vations. The ea&s;ine&s;s wherewith we &s;peak, and the plea&s;ure we take in hearing an harangue gracefully, and well pronounced are, I am &s;ure, not &s;uperficial or trifling recommendations to us to keep, when in our power, the organs of &s;peech perfect and unimpaired; of which organs I by no means reckon the teeth in an inferior cla&s;s.</P>
<P>A collateral advantage ari&s;ing from the care and pre&s;ervation of the teeth, is the grace and &s;ymmetry they give to the coun|tenance, keeping the complexion in a &s;tate of youthful bloom, and preventing all wrinkles about the face; which the de|pre&s;&s;ion of the jaws, in con&s;equence of the
<PB N="22" REF="21">lo&s;s of our teeth, would inevitably occa&s;ion. It is, I am told by my own and other peo|ple's ob&s;ervations, a prevailing fa&s;hion in the pre&s;ent age to keep the face and the complexion as delicate and &s;mooth as art can make them: (I &s;peak not here of our Engli&s;h ladies, who&s;e care in this particular is laudable, graceful, and characteri&s;tic of that amiable part of the creation) but, without meaning any offence to that part of mankind, whom the uncouth ru&s;ticity and unpolitene&s;s of &s;ome among&s;t us think they di&s;grace by giving them the appella|tion of <HI>Beaus,</HI> I beg leave to remind the younger part of my readers, that though they may po&s;&s;ibly take <HI>too much</HI> pains in adorning their per&s;ons, and thereby incur the charge of effeminacy, and the want of a decent and proper manline&s;s, yet I think they may oftentimes take <HI>too little</HI> care in this particular; and none can be attended with more di&s;agreable and offen&s;ive &s;en&s;a|tions, both to them&s;elves and their friends, than the neglect of the teeth.&mdash;Excu&s;es may be made frequently for any neglect of
<PB N="23" REF="22"><HI>Dre&s;s</HI>&mdash;&s;lovenly apparel&mdash;or unpowdered curls, which may be occa&s;ioned by a want of time to undergo the various proce&s;&s;es of dre&s;&s;ing, or the avocations of bu&s;ine&s;s. But no excu&s;es can be made, or taken for a dirty and foul &s;et of teeth, which argue an habitual neglect of them, and either a wilful or (what is ju&s;t as bad in this ca&s;e) an unintentional omi&s;&s;ion of the employ|ment of cleaning them; which employ|ment, when rightly under&s;tood, and fre|quently practi&s;ed, is attended with no length of time, nor the lea&s;t trouble.</P>
<P>The di&s;orders to which the teeth are &s;ub|ject, either &s;imply from the neglect of them, or from an ill habit and &s;tate of body, are numerous. Suffice it here to mention a few; a perfect knowledge of which will, I am per&s;uaded, give weight to my opinion and advice, relative to the care of them. The tooth ache, is a pain, which, as it ari&s;es from various cau&s;es, I &s;uppo&s;e, there are few among&s;t us, who have at all times been totally exempt from. The pain and
<PB N="24" REF="23">angui&s;h are more violent and excruciating than the vi&s;itation of di&s;ea&s;es to other parts of the body. Shake&s;pear, the immortal poet of the Engli&s;h nation &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;There never was philo&s;opher yet,</L>
<L>Who could endure the <HI>tooth-ache</HI> patiently.</L></Q></P>
<P>Meaning certainly thereby, that with what|ever great fortitude, and philo&s;ophical pa|tience, other di&s;orders might be born and combated with.&mdash;The pain of the tooth ache &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all human re&s;olution and cou|rage. The angui&s;h is frequently &s;o in&s;up|portable that it forces us to u&s;e violent means to obtain &s;ome kind of temporary ea&s;e, which means occa&s;ion, not a long time after, a greater and more afflicting return of the di&s;order.&mdash;Such are, I think unnece&s;&s;ary extraction of the teeth, which, according to &s;ome modern operators, is the univer&s;al method of cure; without con&s;idering that the pain may be oftentimes alleviated by gentle methods, and the tooth pre&s;erved entire. It frequently happens that the pain is &s;everely felt in &s;ound teeth,
<PB N="25" REF="24">owing to ulcers and excre&s;cencies on the gums, &s;udden colds, from &s;ympathy with the neighbouring affected parts, or other cau&s;es. Can the extraction of tho&s;e &s;ound teeth be therefore in &s;uch ca&s;es deemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary, or even expedient? common expe|rience and &s;en&s;e &s;hew the contrary.&mdash;We cannot perform the operation without in|crea&s;ing the evil which it is intended to di|mini&s;h or remove. By uncovering the roots, and baring the &s;ockets of the neigh|bouring teeth, we make them loo&s;e, and &s;u&s;ceptible of pain, and cau&s;e frequent in|flammations in their nerves and va&s;cular parts. I have known not a few in&s;tances where the extraction of one of the <HI>molares</HI> or grinders has con&s;iderably weakened the jaw, though performed in a &s;kilful manner, and by a violent di&s;ten&s;ion of the mu&s;cles of the jaw, brought on a great &s;orene&s;s and inflammation of them. I am, however, a great friend to extraction when
<PB N="26" REF="25">the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e po&s;itively demand it. Another method no le&s;s in|judicious of expelling the pain, and gaining a temporary relief, is the filling the mouth with acrid and hot &s;pices and &s;ub&s;tances, and burning &s;pirituous liquors; which deaden all &s;en&s;ation for a while, but when their influence is at an end the pain returns with redoubled &s;trength and &s;everity: ex|clu&s;ive of the harm which &s;uch applications certainly do the gums by di&s;po&s;ing them to inflammations, and occa&s;ioning &s;orene&s;&s;es, and external &s;wellings.</P>
<P>The tooth ache is frequently occa&s;ioned by acrid humours being lodged in the &s;ock|ets of the teeth, and purulent matter, which affects the roots of the teeth, and is always attended with a foul and offen&s;ive &s;mell of the breath. In this ca&s;e, if the cure be not &s;peedily undertaken, the whole
<PB N="27" REF="26">tooth becomes quite rotten and carious: the nerves and ve&s;&s;els are corrupted, and ulcerations of the parts will en&s;ue. Of this kind is the &s;curvy, that mo&s;t inveterate enemy to the &s;oundne&s;s of the teeth, which is however very effectually di&s;&s;odged by lan|cing the gums, and extracting the coagula|ted blood and matter. The tartar of the teeth is another cau&s;e of their de&s;truction, which is a yellowi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance formed on the teeth, which hardens in time, and forms a compleat incru&s;tation over them: deforming and di&s;colouring them, and by &s;ecretly and imperceptibly in&s;inuating it&s;elf in the <HI>inter&s;tices</HI> of the teeth, open too great a pa&s;&s;age between them, prevent the growth of the gums by an inconvenient pre&s;&s;ure of them, and are productive of a numerous train of di&s;orders. This tartar, however, when <HI>early di&s;covered,</HI> is very ea&s;ily removed, being at fir&s;t of a &s;oft pulpy nature, and may be rubbed off the teeth by
<PB N="28" REF="27">wa&s;hing the mouth with clean water, and afterwards gently rubbing the teeth with a &s;oft &s;pungy bru&s;h, or by u&s;ing any common tooth powder. When however it has for|med an incru&s;tation too hard to be rubbed off in that manner, having acquired a &s;trong adhe&s;ion to the teeth, the operator's in&s;tru|ment mu&s;t be u&s;ed, but great care is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be taken in the u&s;e of it, &s;o as not to damage the enamel. Some kind of an inflammation in the gums generally attends this operation, which inflammation may however be reduced with gentle means.</P>
<P>Venereal complaints, and the great quan|tities of mercury which are generally admi|ni&s;tered, in &s;uch ca&s;es, affect the teeth and gums in a violent degree: de&s;troy the nou|ri&s;hment which the teeth &s;hould receive from the nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els, impove|ri&s;h and render the gums pale and flaccid, loo&s;en the teeth from their &s;ockets, and oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="29" REF="28">putrid di&s;orders, attended with foul|ne&s;&s;es of breath. I am not ver&s;ed in &s;urgery enough to be able to declare what methods, to prevent &s;uch complaints and evils, &s;hould be taken, during the continuance of that venereal di&s;order to which they owe their ri&s;e, but certainly would recommend at the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the patient's health, that he &s;hould have his teeth thorougly cleaned, his gums lanced, and all the other nece&s;&s;ary proce&s;&s;es performed, whereby the gums will regain their former redne&s;s and firmne&s;s, and adhere, as originally, clo&s;ely to the teeth; the teeth will be cleared from all foul di&s;colorations, all the coagu|lated blood will be removed from the &s;ockets, and every part be braced a new and &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>The tooth-ache is frequently communi|cated by <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> from one tooth to ano|ther. This may &s;eem &s;urprizing, but I find
<PB N="30" REF="29">all writers on the &s;ubject I have con&s;ulted, agree in the opinion, though without a&s;&s;igning any cau&s;e for &s;o extraordinary a phaenomenon. We mu&s;t not, however, carry our notions of &s;ympathetic affections &s;o far as I remember one writer of my own country has done. I mean one <HI>Durlach Co&s;el,</HI> who was a German and lived I think in the year 1558 under Ferdinand the Fir&s;t. In a treati&s;e of his writing upon &s;urgery, (which I remember to have &s;een in manu|&s;cript in Leip&s;ic) he po&s;itively affirms, that &s;ympathy may be communicated <HI>by contact</HI> to other animals: and mentions &s;ome in&s;tances where he has known the tooth-ache transferred from a man to a cat, by applying the man's cheek for a con&s;ider|able time together, to that of the cat. The tooth-ache left the man, and the ani|mal was &s;eized with the violence of the pain, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the agony &s;he &s;eemed to labour under, and the &s;qualling
<PB N="31" REF="30">&s;he made. This will, I make no doubt, be looked upon by all &s;erious and &s;en&s;ible people as a fooli&s;h notion, and not founded in fact; and indeed I am greatly &s;urprized that that writer &s;hould &s;o warmly in&s;i&s;t on the reality of it, as he was undoubtedly, by &s;everal works which he left behind him, a man of great wi&s;dom and learning.</P>
<P>I will now ju&s;t mention a few ca&s;es, in which extraction of the teeth may be expe|dient or nece&s;&s;ary, which will introduce &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon artificial teeth, and the practice of filling up hollow teeth with gold or lead.</P>
<P>When the &s;curvy, or other putrid hu|mour, lies preying upon the roots or fangs of the teeth, removed beyond the reach of tho&s;e in&s;truments that can extract it from the gums by lancing them; when it de&s;troys the nerves, and corrupts the foun|dation
<PB N="32" REF="31">of the tooth; in &s;uch ca&s;es, I mu&s;t deem extraction nece&s;&s;ary, and that it is &s;o, will inconte&s;tibly appear, &s;ince we find the root or fang of the tooth quite covered with the corrupted matter, when we have pul|led it out: which corrupted matter there is no po&s;&s;ibility of reaching with our in|&s;truments, or expelling by any other means than extirpation, as it lies &s;o clo&s;e and con|cealed. Were the tooth to continue in the head, the corrupted matter would eat the tooth gradually upwards, and occa&s;ion a putrid decay of the gums. Stumps or por|tions of the roots of teeth which have either been broken off, or injudiciou&s;ly ex|tracted, ought certainly to be drawn. There is not much pain in this operation, when &s;kilfully performed, in a comparative &s;en&s;e with regard to <HI>whole</HI> teeth being extracted. Mr. Beardmore's opinion is, that <Q>"when any tooth-ache ari&s;es from a portion of the root left behind, if the
<PB N="33" REF="32">patient is unwilling to try this &s;econd operation, the pain may be &s;ometimes removed by burning the nerve, or by applying a very &s;mall bit of lint dipped in e&s;&s;ential oil of cinnamon, over the hollow part of the &s;tump, or by intro|ducing a bit of pa&s;te made of opium, camphor, and e&s;&s;ential oil of pepper mint."</Q> But with all po&s;&s;ible deference to his opinion, I &s;hould certainly prefer the extraction of the &s;tump, and recommend it in &s;uch &s;trong terms to the patient, as would, I think induce him to &s;ubmit to the opera|tion. Palliative applications may give ea&s;e, though Mr. Beardmore &s;eems him|&s;elf to own the ca&s;e to be uncertain, by making u&s;e of the word <HI>"&s;ometimes;"</HI> but I think the pain will return in a &s;hort time, or the gums will grow over the&s;e &s;tumps, and being con&s;tantly wounded by them, will be expo&s;ed to frequent inflammations, and extremities of pain. I am happy in
<PB N="34" REF="33">having Mr. Beardmore's authority to &s;anction my opinion, that <Q>"The &s;tump or root of a tooth is at all times ea&s;ily taken out, unle&s;s it grows to the jaw bone, which is a very rare ca&s;e; and nothing is more erroneous than the popular notion that &s;tumps are very difficult to be remo|ved, and that digging and punching (as they call it) are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary."</Q></P>
<P>Stopping the teeth, or filling them with gold, or lead, is a very u&s;eful practice, and attended with no inconveniences. This is nece&s;&s;ary when the internal part of the tooth is de&s;troyed, or wa&s;ted away, and &s;omething mu&s;t be put in the cavity, to prevent the air from piercing to the fang, or root of it, and occa&s;ioning the tooth|ache, or a further decay; as al&s;o for hin|dering loo&s;e bits of our food, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from lod|ging in the &s;aid cavity. The cavity then, in which the nerve formerly lodged, mu&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="34">be well filled up with gold or lead, and, if occa&s;ion be, may be fa&s;tened by a wire or thread to the neighbouring teeth: how|ever, after it has been well pre&s;&s;ed down in the hole, there will be no danger of its falling out.</P>
<P>When there is a real nece&s;&s;ity of extract|ing teeth, or they grow loo&s;e from any venereal or putrid di&s;order in the blood, I am a great friend to the practice of &s;upply|ing their places with artificial teeth. After a little u&s;e, they equally as well perform the different offices of real teeth, in ma&s;ti|cation, in &s;peech, and in appearance. In|deed to &s;uch a pitch of greatne&s;s has the art and ingenuity of modern times arrived, that operators can make them, and fit them in the &s;ockets in &s;uch a manner as not to be di&s;cernible from our natural teeth. Af|ter wa&s;hing the mouth con&s;tantly for &s;ome time afterwards with &s;ome a&s;tringent liquors,
<PB N="36" REF="35">we find that the gums will clo&s;ely adhere to the&s;e artificial teeth. I have frequently made and &s;et whole rows of artificial teeth, which have looked very ornamental, and have given an healthy air to the coun|tenance. The general objection &s;eems to be that they do not fit firm and ea&s;y in the &s;ockets, but are apt to fall out. This ob|jection I flatter my&s;elf, in the cour&s;e of my practice as a denti&s;t, I can wholly obviate: for without meaning or wi&s;hing to be my own paneygri&s;t, or de&s;irous of arrogating any credit to extravagant profe&s;&s;ions which &s;ome modern operators for the teeth among us do, I can &s;afely pronounce that this branch of the profe&s;&s;ion has employed greatly my time and attention, and I have, in con&s;equence of that attention, di&s;covered a method of &s;etting and fixing them almo&s;t immoveably in the &s;ockets, without the great number of wires and ligatures which are commonly u&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<P>It remains for me now to &s;ay &s;omething of the care and treatment of the teeth and gums, to prevent di&s;ea&s;es and complaints in them,&mdash;the methods of cure, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions for cleaning them, and pre&s;erving their poli&s;h and whitene&s;s.&mdash;But I here perceive a difficulty which I was not aware of at fir&s;t, which is, the impo&s;|&s;ibility of all the rules and directions I mean to propo&s;e being equally &s;alutary and efficacious in <HI>all</HI> ca&s;es.&mdash;<HI>Different</HI> modes of treatment mu&s;t be pre&s;cribed in <HI>different</HI> ca&s;es;&mdash;and as it would be morally im|po&s;&s;ible for me now to know the different &s;tate of the teeth in all my different readers, the various complaints they labour under, and whether they have ever taken care of their teeth or not, it is equally as impo&s;&s;ible to advance any directions which would be of nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>to all, in all ca&s;es;</HI> I &s;hall however be exceedingly happy when any per&s;ons approve &s;o far of the &s;entiments
<PB N="38" REF="37">and opinions advanced in the above pages, and think the contents of this work of con|&s;equence enough to let me have the honour of attending them; whereby I &s;hall be able upon a per&s;onal and direct view of the ca&s;e to decide with &s;ome degree of certainty, and to found my advice upon ocular proofs.&mdash;The &s;curvy mu&s;t certainly be removed from the gums, and all tartareous concretions &s;eparated from the teeth, and all putrid matter di&s;lodged from the &s;ock|ets, before we can think of u&s;ing any ex|ternal application to make the teeth white and clean: for otherwi&s;e, might they not be compared, with great plau&s;ibility, to &s;epulchres and monuments, which are painted and adorned with pure and &s;plen|did marble on the out&s;ide, but within con|tain nothing but rottene&s;s and corruption?
<PB N="39" REF="38">&mdash;I think it therefore nece&s;&s;ary, as I &s;aid before, to have the &s;curvy removed from the gums; all tartareous concretions &s;epa|rated from the teeth; and all putrid matter di&s;lodged from the &s;ockets <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> and <HI>then</HI> external applications may be u&s;ed to make the teeth white, and free them from all di&s;colorations.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking, (notwith&s;tanding what I am going to &s;ay oppo&s;es the opi|nions and advice of &s;ome of our modern writers on the &s;ubject, though I believe that <HI>Hoffman</HI> and <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> two German writers of eminence on phy&s;ic and &s;urgery, have introduced their approbation of the point in que&s;tion) that the occa&s;ional u&s;e of tooth-picks is nece&s;&s;ary in an high de|gree to remove what &s;craps of our food have lodged between the inter&s;tices of our
<PB N="40" REF="39">teeth, and to give a &s;alutary <HI>&s;timulus</HI> to the gums. The objections I hear, are certainly levelled again&s;t too con&s;tant an application of tooth-picks; but to argue again&s;t a practice and u&s;e in general terms, becau&s;e it is frequently abu&s;ed, and carried to too great extremities in particular in&s;tances, is ab&s;urd and ridiculous. The cu&s;tom of wa&s;hing the mouth with clear water, after the u&s;e of tooth-picks, is certainly judi|cious, and the cu&s;tom of u&s;ing occa&s;ionally cool emollient gargles.</P>
<P>I could willingly indulge my pen in a further prolixity, but am fearful of enga|ging the attention of my readers longer than their patience will countenance: and likewi&s;e of making this a work of labo|rious and diligent inve&s;tigations, which is only a &s;hort collection of a few ca&s;ual ob|&s;ervations
<PB N="41" REF="40">and loo&s;e remarks, which I have ha&s;tily thrown together, and now venture to &s;olicit the patronage and protection of the Gentlemen of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, as this publication is in con&s;equence of the de&s;ire of many of them, founded upon too favourable an opinion of the author's merit.</P>
