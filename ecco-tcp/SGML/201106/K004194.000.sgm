<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY Into the fir&s;t Eight Years INOCULATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now about ten Years &s;ince the Inoculation of the Small Pox has been introduced a|mong us: Mo&s;t contrary at fir&s;t were Mens Opinions about it; &s;ome were confident the Practice would be of little Service, that the Di|&s;temper
<PB N="6" REF="3">could not be thus given, or if given, would not be le&s;s dan|gerous to the Patient; others, that it would be &s;o beneficial, as that no one could die of the Small Pox, who thus underwent it.</P>
<P>The Writers of either Side were not a few, and many Rea&s;ons both for and again&s;t the Practice were daily publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>However, the Inoculation went on, and the mo&s;t impartial Judges were of Opinion, that how plau|&s;ible &s;oever the Rea&s;ons might be on either Side, that the Service or Di&s;&s;ervice of it would be&s;t be known by ob&s;erving the various Succe&s;s of it, and then comparing the Danger
<PB N="7" REF="4">of dying by the Inoculation, with the Danger of dying by the Small Pox in the natural Way.</P>
<P>To this End the learned Doctors <HI>Jurin</HI> and <HI>Scheuchzer</HI> have taken great Pains in getting in the Ac|counts of the Succe&s;s of all the Per&s;ons inoculated for the fir&s;t eight Years, as al&s;o of the Hazard Men underwent who had the Small Pox in the natural Way, and with Faith|fulne&s;s not to be called in Que&s;tion have publi&s;hed them.</P>
<P>By their Accounts it appears, that eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons have received the Small Pox by the Inoculation, and that &s;eventeen of them, or only one
<PB N="8" REF="5">Per&s;on in fifty hath been &s;u&s;pected to have died by it.</P>
<P>That in the natural Way, out of eighteen thou&s;and two hundred and twenty-nine Per&s;ons who have been &s;ick of the Small Pox, three thou&s;and and eight Per&s;ons, or one in &s;ix, hath died of it.</P>
<P>Their Conclu&s;ion is, that if the&s;e eight hundred and forty-five Per|&s;ons had had the Small Pox in the natural Way, one in &s;ix of them might be reckoned to have died by it, that is, one hundred and for|ty, or rather, one hundred and for|ty-one Per&s;ons; that is, one hun|dred and twenty-three, or one hun|dred and twenty-four more than
<PB N="9" REF="6">there died by the Inoculation, which Number of Lives they therefore think may actually be reckoned to have been &s;aved by this Prac|tice.</P>
<P>It is very ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that the Advantage here &s;hown is not the real Advantage, but a &s;uppo|&s;ed one, it is grounded upon a Suppo&s;ition, that all tho&s;e eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons mu&s;t have undergone the Di&s;temper, a Suppo&s;ition no otherwi&s;e true than that all Per&s;ons whatever mu&s;t un|dergo it, which, though indeed it hath been often a&s;&s;erted, is yet a Suppo&s;ition, of which every Day's Ob&s;ervation in the Death of ma|ny Per&s;ons who never had this
<PB N="10" REF="7">Di&s;temper demon&s;trates the Fal&s;e|hood.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing by then this &s;uppo&s;ed Advantage, let us enquire into the real one, which can only be known by comparing the Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the&s;e eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons being inoculated, not with the Lo&s;s out of &s;o many Per&s;ons who actually undergo the Di&s;tem|per, but with the Lo&s;s out of as many who not &s;ubmitting to the Operation, take their Chance of having it in the natural Way.</P>
<P>Were Bills of Mortality pub|li&s;h'd for the whole Kingdom, as there are for <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter,</HI> what this Lo&s;s would be,
<PB N="11" REF="8">would ea&s;ily appear, &s;ince by them it would be ea&s;y to &s;ee what Propor|tion the Number of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who die of the Small Pox bears, to the Number of Per&s;ons who die of all other Di&s;tempers; and, con|&s;equently, in any given Number, how many would probably die of this Di&s;temper, or what would be the Lo&s;s out of the eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But &s;uch Bills are only to be wi&s;h'd for; till we can have more Light in this Affair, we mu&s;t be contented with &s;uch as the <HI>London</HI> Bills afford us.</P>
<P>From a Table of Ca&s;ualties for twenty Years, publi&s;hed by the in|genious
<PB N="12" REF="9">Mr. <HI>Graunt,</HI> it appears, that out of two hundred twenty-nine thou&s;and two hundred and fifty-&s;ix Per&s;ons, there died of the Small Pox ten thou&s;and five hun|dred and &s;eventy-&s;ix, or one in twenty-one.</P>
<P>By a Table publi&s;h'd by Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> for forty-two Years, one Per&s;on in fourteen died of this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>And by a Table publi&s;hed by Dr. <HI>Scheuchzer</HI> for eight Years, tho&s;e Years in which the Inoculation has been practi&s;ed, one Per&s;on in twelve hath died of it.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e Tables, or whe|ther any of them may be made the
<PB N="13" REF="10">Standard of the Mortality of the Small Pox, will not ea&s;ily be deci|ded.</P>
<P>The Favourers of the Inoculati|on will think the la&s;t Table the mo&s;t proper to be made the Stand|ard, and in regard to Per&s;ons li|ving at <HI>London</HI> not unju&s;tly, but the Enemies of it will think, and perhaps with as much Rea&s;on, that even the fir&s;t Table repre&s;ents the Small Pox too &s;evere, to be made the general Standard of the Danger of it in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>Till a better Standard can be fix'd, it may not, perhaps, be great|ly ami&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e the la&s;t Table the Standard of the Mortality of the
<PB N="14" REF="11">Small Pox at <HI>London,</HI> and the fir&s;t Table the Standard for the Kingdom in general, and &s;o proceed to en|quire, what Benefit hath ari&s;en from the Inoculation, as each of the&s;e Tables is made the Standard of the Danger of the Small Pox in the na|tural Way.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t Table, when one Per&s;on out of twenty-one die of the Small Pox in the natural Way, then out of eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons, there could only be reckoned to have died forty, and whereas there died out of the &s;ame Number by the Inoculation &s;even|teen, the Lives of twenty-three Per&s;ons only can ju&s;tly be reckoned to have been &s;aved by this Practice.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="12">
<P>By the &s;econd Table, when one in fourteen died of it in the natural Way, &s;ixty Per&s;ons out of the eight hundred and forty-five would have then died of it, and forty-three Per&s;ons more than there died by the Inoculation. And</P>
<P>By the la&s;t Table, when in the natural Way, one out of twelve died of this Di&s;temper, &s;eventy Per&s;ons out of the eight hundred and forty-five would have died of it, and fifty-three more than by the Inoculation.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e Accounts, it ap|pears, that many Lives have been &s;aved by this Practice; but that
<PB N="16" REF="13">the learned Gentlemen in reckon|ing one hundred and twenty-three, or one hundred and twenty-four Lives, &s;eem to have been mi&s;ta|ken.</P>
<P>But though fewer Lives are lo&s;t by the Inoculation than in the na|tural Way, yet as the Lo&s;s of them one way is almo&s;t pre&s;ent, and in the other at &s;ome di&s;tance of time, it cannot appear unju&s;t to make a further Deduction on this Account from the Number of Lives &s;aved by the Inoculation.</P>
<P>Out of fifty Per&s;ons inoculated at a certain time given, one of them is &s;uppo&s;ed to die of the Small Pox, and that pre&s;ently.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="14">
<P>Should the&s;e fifty refu&s;e to &s;ub|mit to the Operation, about four of them would die, and three Lives would be &s;aved by the Practice.</P>
<P>But the time of the&s;e having the Small Pox is yet at a Di&s;tance; &s;uppo&s;e at the time given for their Inoculation, the Lives of the&s;e Per|&s;ons to be each of the Value of thirty Years, or that the&s;e four Per|&s;ons one with another were to live thirty Years exclu&s;ive of the Dan|ger of their dying by the Small Pox; &s;uppo&s;e now each of the&s;e Per&s;ons were to live fifteen Years from the time given for their Ino|culation before they had the Di|&s;temper, it is plain the&s;e four to|gether
<PB N="18" REF="15">would have lived &s;ixty Years, the value of two Lives, before they died of this Di&s;temper, which be|ing deduced out of the four Lives that are lo&s;t out of the fifty in the natural Way, two only can be ac|counted to be lo&s;t out of that Num|ber, and only one Life more than in the Way of Inoculation.</P>
<P>What Deduction is to be made on this Account out of the Num|ber of the Lives which are &s;aved by the Inoculation cannot be determi|ned, unle&s;s we could fir&s;t deter|mine, from a time given for their Inoculation, how long tho&s;e Per&s;ons may be accounted to live, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to die at la&s;t of the Small Pox in the natural Way, and then
<PB N="19" REF="16">the Deduction would be plain and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e Per&s;ons then be &s;uppo&s;ed to live a &s;econd, a third, a fourth, or &s;ixteenth Part of their Lives, let the Fraction, whatever it be, be multiplied by the Num|ber of the Per&s;ons that are reckon|ed to die, as many Unites as the Product will be, &s;o many Lives are to be deduced from tho&s;e ac|counted to be &s;aved by the Inocu|lation.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider that few Per|&s;ons are inoculated but when the Danger &s;eems near of their having the Small Pox, I cannot well &s;up|po&s;e them to live longer than one
<PB N="20" REF="17">fourth of their Lives before they have it, and when I con&s;ider that Per&s;ons chiefly inoculated are very young Per&s;ons, and that the Mor|tality of the Small Pox is mo&s;tly among tho&s;e that are grown up, I am not inclined to think they &s;hould have it much &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Let us then &s;uppo&s;e that the Per&s;ons who die at la&s;t of the Small Pox live one fourth of their Lives from the time given for their Inoculation, and the Deduction from the Number of Lives &s;aved by the Inoculation will be as fol|lows.</P>
<P>According to the fir&s;t Table, when forty Per&s;ons out of the eight
<PB N="21" REF="18">hundred and forty-five die in the natural Way, each of the&s;e forty living one fourth of their Lives from the time given for their Ino|culation, together equal to ten whole Lives; thirty Lives only may more ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be lo&s;t in the natural Way, and only thirteen Lives more than by the way of Ino|culation.</P>
<P>According to the &s;econd Table, when &s;ixty Per&s;ons die in the na|tural Way, the&s;e &s;ixty living each one fourth, or together fifteen whole Lives; forty-five Lives can only then be &s;aid to be lo&s;t in the natu|ral Way, and but twenty-eight more than by the Inoculation.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="19">
<P>According to the third Table, when &s;eventy Per&s;ons die in the natural Way, the&s;e &s;eventy living each one fourth, or &s;eventeen whole Lives, fifty-three Lives can only then be &s;aid to be lo&s;t in the na|tural Way, and thirty-&s;ix only more than by the Inoculation.</P>
<P>Were this Di&s;temper not an in|fectious one, I &s;hould here fini&s;h this Enquiry, and determine the Advantage to be on the &s;ide of the Inoculation. But it is mo&s;t cer|tainly otherwi&s;e, &s;o that it will be proper to inquire farther, how far the Inoculation of the&s;e eight hun|dred and forty-five Per&s;ons may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;pread this Di|&s;temper,
<PB N="23" REF="20">and compare the Mi&s;chief probably ari&s;ing from the increas'd Infection, with the Mi&s;chief that is prevented, or with the Lo&s;s of as many Lives as are accounted to have been &s;aved by the Practice.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons to take their Chance of having the Small Pox in the natural Way, it is ea&s;y to find out how many probably would have the Di&s;temper and how many would e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>Upon the exacte&s;t Inquiry that could be made, and the be&s;t Ac|counts that have been given in, it appears that one Per&s;on in &s;ix
<PB N="24" REF="21">die, that hath the Small Pox in the natural Way.</P>
<P>In any given Number then &s;ix times the Number of the Per&s;ons who are accounted to die of this Di&s;temper, &s;hould be accounted to undergo it, and the Remainder to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>According to the fir&s;t Table then, when out of the eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons, forty only are &s;uppo&s;ed to die of the Small Pox in the natural Way, &s;ix times forty, or two hundred and forty Per&s;ons only &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have this Di&s;temper, and &s;ix hundred and five Per&s;ons to e&s;cape it.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="22">
<P>According to the fir&s;t Table then, when out of the eight hundred and forty-five Per&s;ons forty only are &s;uppo&s;ed to die of the Small Pox in the natural Way, &s;ix times for|ty, or two hundred and forty Per|&s;ons only &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have this Di&s;temper, and &s;ix hun|dred and five Per&s;ons to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>According to the &s;econd Table, when &s;ixty Per&s;ons are accounted to die, three hundred and &s;ixty Per|&s;ons &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have this Di&s;temper, and four hundred and eighty-five to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>By the third Table, when &s;even|ty Per&s;ons are reckoned to die of
<PB N="26" REF="23">it, four hundred and twenty-two Per|&s;ons &s;hould be reckoned to have this Di&s;temper, and as many to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>The Mi&s;chief then ari&s;ing from the Inoculation of the&s;e eight hun|dred and forty-five Per&s;ons, is the Mi&s;chief that ari&s;es from &s;ix hun|dred and five Per&s;ons having this infectious Di&s;temper, who other|wi&s;e would probably have e&s;caped it, or from four hundred and eighty-five, or from four hundred and twenty-two Per&s;ons, as each of the&s;e Tables is made the Standard of the Mortality of the Small Pox in the natural Way.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tions then to determine, whether the Inoculation be of Ser|vice,
<PB N="27" REF="24">or not, according to the &s;everal Tables, are different, and the&s;e;</P>
<P>According to the fir&s;t, Which is better, or of more Service to Man|kind, the &s;aving of twenty-three Lives, or, according to the Deducti|on, of thirteen, or preventing the Mi&s;chief which ari&s;eth from &s;ix hun|dred and five Per&s;ons having this in|fectious Di&s;temper?</P>
<P>According to the &s;econd, Which is better, the &s;aving forty-three Lives, or, according to the Deduction, twen|ty-eight, or preventing the Mi&s;chief from the Infection of four hundred and eighty-five Per&s;ons?</P>
<P>According to the third, Which is better, the &s;aving fifty-three, or, if
<PB N="28" REF="25">the Deduction is to be allowed, thir|ty-&s;ix Lives, or preventing the Mi&s;|chief from the Infection of four hundred and twenty-two Per&s;ons?</P>
<P>The&s;e Que&s;tions may be different|ly an&s;wered, and the Practice accord|ingly either univer&s;ally approved, or univer&s;ally condemned, or perhaps allowed in one place, and condemn|ed in another.</P>
<P>To &s;ay there is no Mi&s;chief to be feared from the increas'd Infections of &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons would be a very bold A&s;&s;ertion, yet what the Mi&s;chief probably to be expected is, is very difficult to determine.</P>
<P>The general, if not univer&s;al way of having the Small Pox, is account|ed
<PB N="29" REF="26">to be from Infection, and the Di&s;temper now for &s;ome Years la&s;t pa&s;t hath &s;eemed to have been at a &s;tand; that is, the Mortality of it &s;eems neither to have much increa|&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, and the Number of Per&s;ons that undergo it to have been neither much greater or le&s;s.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Propo&s;itions are true, each Per&s;on who has the Small Pox may be &s;uppo&s;ed the Cau&s;e of another Per&s;on's having it.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s therefore the Mi&s;chief of Infection be le&s;s from a Per&s;on ino|culated, than from one who has the Small Pox in the natural Way, the Mi&s;chief probably to be ex|pected from the increas'd Infection will be as follows.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="27">
<P>By the fir&s;t Table, when from the Inoculation &s;ix hundred and five Per&s;ons out of the eight hun|dred and forty-five have the Small Pox, who otherwi&s;e would have e&s;caped it, the&s;e &s;ix hundred and five infecting or giving the Di|&s;temper to an equal Number, and one out of &s;ix of them dying ac|cording to the Standard of the Mor|tality of the Small Pox to tho&s;e that have them, the Mi&s;chief from the increas'd Infection will be the Lo&s;s of the Lives of one hundred Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>By the &s;econd Table, when four hundred and eighty-five Per&s;ons have the Small Pox, who without the
<PB N="31" REF="28">Inoculation would have e&s;caped them, the &s;ame Number will be by them infected, and the Mi&s;chief will be the Lo&s;s of the Lives of eighty Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>By the third Table, when four hundred and twenty-two Per&s;ons have the Small Pox, who without this Practice would not have had them; an equal Number will be infected, and the Mi&s;chief from the increas'd Infection will be the Lo&s;s of the Lives of &s;eventy Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Suppo&s;itions may be admitted, the Inoculation for the fir&s;t eight Years appears to have been of great Di&s;&s;ervice to the World, &s;ince the Lives &s;aved to the Per|&s;ons
<PB N="32" REF="29">them&s;elves inoculated fall very &s;hort of the Lives lo&s;t from the increas'd Infection.</P>
<P>Yet we have only now con&s;ider|ed the Mi&s;chief ari&s;ing immediately from the fir&s;t Infection from the Per&s;ons them&s;elves inoculated; but the Mi&s;chief ends not here, the Per&s;ons thus infected may be ac|counted the Cau&s;es of a future In|fection, and the Small Pox with in|creas'd Strength may de&s;cend to our late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
