<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF MAGNESIA ALBA, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT two years &s;ince I publi&s;hed a &s;mall volume of <HI>Experiments and Ob&s;ervations on va|rious Subjects,</HI> which al&s;o contained &s;ome ac|count of the di&s;ea&s;es in which Magne&s;ia Alba is particu|larly u&s;eful, and a recommendation of that medicine in a &s;tate of calcination, as preferable, in many in&s;tances, to the uncalcined Magne&s;ia. But as the remarks on this &s;ubject are intermixed with a number of others which are only intere&s;ting to medical or philo&s;ophical readers, I have been frequently reque&s;ted to draw up a plain detail of the hi&s;tory and medicinal u&s;es of Magne&s;ia, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e per&s;ons who may be purcha&s;ers of the medi|cine, and to whom the other part of my former publica|tion would be entirely u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>Previous therefore to the recital of the virtues of Mag|ne&s;ia, it may not be improper to give a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the invention of this medicine, and of the gradual pro|gre&s;s by which it has arrived at the degree of e&s;timation in which it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e mineral bodies which contain metallic earths, the earlier Chemi&s;ts gave the name of Marca&s;ites; and tho&s;e earths, which were capable of attracting the acid from the atmo&s;phere, and thereby forming &s;alts, were termed Magne&s;ia. The fir&s;t preparers of Magne&s;ia Alba, who procured it from the mother-ley of nitre, or liquor remaining after the cry&s;tallization of that &s;alt, imagining it to be the proper ab&s;orbent of the nitrous acid, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have given it the name of Magne&s;ia, and the epithet <HI>Alba</HI> appears to have been added as a di&s;tinction, on account of its &s;uperior whitene&s;s.</P>
<P>Magne&s;ia Alba was fir&s;t introduced by the Je&s;uits at Rome, and the preparation of it was concealed by them, for &s;ome time, as a no&s;trum. But the &s;ecret, at length, was divulged, and its u&s;e became more general in &s;everal countries on the continent. It has been ob&s;erved above that it was at fir&s;t prepared from the mother-ley of nitre, and it was &s;ometimes obtained by evaporating the liquor, and afterwards driving off, by means of a &s;trong fire, the acid with which it was combined; and &s;ometimes by precipitating the Magne&s;ia by pouring in a &s;ufficient quantity of an alkaline lixivium.</P>
<P>The powder, thus prepared, was not however pure Magne&s;ia. A quantity of wood a&s;hes and quick-lime are nece&s;&s;ary to the cry&s;tallization of nitre, and, in con|&s;equence, the Magne&s;ia, &s;eparated from the liquor re|maining
<PB N="7" REF="6">maining after that proce&s;s, contained a proportion of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. Be&s;ides, as but little nitre is prepared in Europe, the difficulty of obtaining the liquor in &s;uffi|cient quantity was an impediment to the general prepa|ration of Magne&s;ia. That excellent Phy&s;ician and inge|nious Chemi&s;t, Hoffman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoffman, Vol. 4. p. 500.</NOTE> was induced, from the &s;imi|larity between <HI>that</HI> lixivium and the brine remaining af|ter the cry&s;tallization of &s;ea &s;alt, to try whether Magne|&s;ia might not be precipitated from the latter. The ex|periment &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;hes, and he even found the powder, thus obtained, to be more purgative than the other. His animadver&s;ions and experiments on this preparation were publi&s;hed, and engaged the attention of phy&s;icians to a medicine &s;o &s;trongly recommended by that celebrated profe&s;&s;or. Dr. Black, to whom we are obliged for many ingenious experiments tending to in|ve&s;tigate the Chemical Hi&s;tory of Magne&s;ia, rendered the proce&s;s &s;till more ea&s;y by &s;ub&s;tituting the bitter purg|ing &s;alt, commonly known by the name of Ep&s;om Salt, which is prepared from the la&s;t mentioned brine, in&s;tead of the brine it&s;elf, thereby enabling chemi&s;ts to prepare the medicine, though at a di&s;tance from tho&s;e places where &s;ea-water is evaporated.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s, notwith&s;tanding, publi&s;hed by Dr. Black, was little known, and in &s;ome re&s;pects defective. Mag|ne&s;ia Alba was indeed &s;old in the &s;hops, but ill prepared, coar&s;e and adulterated. Scarcely any was to be met with, in a tolerable &s;tate of purity, except what was prepared by the late Mr. Gla&s;s of Oxford, who, having
<PB N="8" REF="7">be&s;towed much attention on the &s;ubject, produced it greatly &s;uperior to any at that time vended. This gentleman however had not the genero&s;ity to divulge his proce&s;s, but carefully concealed it as a profitable no&s;trum.</P>
<P>About &s;ixteen years ago, I happened to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood of Mr. Gla&s;s; I had before that time frequently prepared Magne&s;ia, but had never been able to make it equally fine as his, though far &s;uperior to what was commonly &s;old. My ambition was excited, I wi&s;hed to attain to a like degree of perfection, and, after many trials I arrived at the de&s;ired point, and found, by repeated compari&s;ons, that the Magne&s;ia which I pre|pared, equalled that of Mr. Gla&s;s in every re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When I left Oxford, I made no other u&s;e of the di&s;|covery I had made than preparing Magne&s;ia for my own &s;hop, and freely communicating what I knew on the &s;ubject to my acquaintance. After &s;ome years it occur|red to me that it might be of public utility to draw up an account of the method I had made u&s;e of, and to de|liver it to the College of Phy&s;icians, who are the proper guardians of medicine in this kingdom. I accordingly tran&s;mitted my proce&s;s to the College, who did me the honour of publi&s;hing it in their Tran&s;actions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Medical Tran&s;actions, Vol. 2. p. 226.</NOTE></P>
<P>Some time after the publication of the Volume of Tran&s;actions which contained my method of preparing Magne&s;ia; Dr. Saunders, a very ingenious phy&s;ician in London, who&s;e exten&s;ive knowledge in chemi&s;try has been di&s;played in &s;everal publications, mentioned in con|ver&s;ation, to Dr. Percival, the great improvement which
<PB N="9" REF="8">Magne&s;ia was capable of receiving by calcination. That by this means it might be deprived of tho&s;e di&s;agreeable qualities which occa&s;ioned flatulencies in the bowels of &s;ome tender people, and had brought the medicine into a degree of di&s;repute. My worthy friend, &s;en&s;ible how much I was intere&s;ted in every di&s;covery on that &s;ubject, communicated the information to me, and on trial of this proce&s;s, I found the Magne&s;ia improved to the ut|mo&s;t of my expectation; it was perfectly mild, and as free from cau&s;ticity after as before calcination; it operated in half the do&s;e, and occa&s;ioned none of tho&s;e di&s;agree|able &s;en&s;ations in the bowels which often follow the u&s;e of common Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>From hence I was in&s;en&s;ibly led into a train of other experiments which have been &s;ince publi&s;hed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experiments and Ob&s;ervations on various Subjects, by Thomas Henry, London, 1773.</NOTE> and it is hoped may have contributed to explain the nature of Mag|ne&s;ia, and determine its medicinal properties more accu|rately than had hitherto been done. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e experiments, it was ob&s;erved that the <HI>Calcined</HI> Magne&s;ia did not di&s;&s;olve &s;o <HI>rapidly</HI> in the vitriolic acid as the <HI>uncalcined,</HI> and being de&s;irous of comparing &s;ome other with my own, and imagining I might depend on the purity of that vended under the name of Mr. Gla&s;s, who had, &s;ome time before, &s;old his proce&s;s to Mr. Delamotte, who then re&s;ided, as a &s;tationer, at Weymouth; I purcha&s;ed a box, from the agent for the &s;ale of it in Manche&s;ter, that I might calcine it, and ob&s;erve whether it acquired the &s;ame or different properties from that which I had prepared.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e experiments, and the caution with which I proceeded, has been already delivered to the public; and the torrent of abu&s;e, which has &s;o plentifully flowed upon me in con&s;equence of the di&s;co|very, is notorious. Con&s;cious of my own integrity, I have &s;tood undaunted at the attacks which malice and revenge &s;ugge&s;ted. The unchemical doctrines, the ab|&s;urd inferences, the glaring contradictions, and illiberal language, with which the publications of my antago|ni&s;ts abounded, &s;erved only to convince the public of the badne&s;s of a cau&s;e &s;o meanly, &s;o ungenerou&s;ly de|fended.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE ACTION OF ABSORBENT MEDICINES IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a mixture of animal and vegetable food has remained a &s;hort time in the &s;tomach, a fermentation en&s;ues, which is nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the work of dige&s;tion, but which, when it becomes exce&s;|&s;ive, degenerates into di&s;ea&s;e. During this fermentati|on a con&s;iderable quantity of air is produced, and the alimentary mixture gradually tends to acidity.</P>
<P>To re&s;train the inordinate ferment in the &s;tomach, na|ture has wi&s;ely given us the &s;aliva or &s;pittle, which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the property of preventing it from ri&s;ing to a degree injurious to health. But where the &s;aliva is either cor|rupted
<PB N="11" REF="10">or in&s;ufficient in quantity, where the tone of the &s;tomach is &s;o weak, as to detain the aliment too long before it be pu&s;hed forward through the pylorus into the &s;mall inte&s;tines, or where the nature of the aliment it|&s;elf is too much di&s;po&s;ed to ferment; in all the&s;e ca&s;es the air, which is of the &s;ame nature as that di&s;charg|ed in the fermentation of vinous liquors, di&s;tends the &s;tomach, and an obnoxious, and &s;ometimes mo&s;t au|&s;tere acid is produced, which irritates the coats of that bowel, particularly that plexus of nerves which is dif|fu&s;ed about its upper orifice, and occa&s;ions pain, four belchings, vomiting and heart-burn.</P>
<P>As this was the mo&s;t obvious kind of acrimony, it became the fa&s;hion, among the chemi&s;ts of the &s;even|teenth century, to a&s;cribe the origin of almo&s;t all di&s;|ea&s;es to a redundant acid; and their practice con&s;i&s;ted in giving to their patients alkaline &s;alts and ab&s;orbent earths, &s;uch as chalk, calcined oy&s;ter &s;hells, crab's claws, &amp;c. and the&s;e were frequently admini&s;tered in ca&s;es where, perhaps, remedies of a very oppo&s;ite kind were requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>But when &s;cience became more founded on rational principles than on imaginary hypothe&s;es, this practice lo&s;t ground, and the u&s;e of ab&s;orbents was confined to its proper bounds, to the correction of acidities when obviou&s;ly prevailing in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. And here in|deed was a large field for the employment of the&s;e me|dicines, a field which, perhaps, daily became more &s;pa|cious, as luxury more prevailed, and as the increa&s;e of arts and manufactures tended to enervate the people by inducing them to lead more &s;edentary lives.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>Even in this &s;tate of things, inconveniences aro&s;e from the property which all the common ab&s;orbents po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of being a&s;tringent. For though they, for a time, cor|rected acidity, yet they produced &s;uch a degree of co&s;|tivene&s;s, as in effect rather added to the di&s;ea&s;e they were intended to cure, and an ab&s;orbent earth of a dif|ferent nature was a de&s;ideratum in practice.</P>
<P>Dr. Cadogan appears to have been the fir&s;t phy&s;ician who introduced the u&s;e of Magne&s;ia Alba into the&s;e kingdoms. In his excellent treati&s;e on the management of children, he recommended this powder as being more ea&s;ily &s;oluble in acids than the common ab&s;orbents, and as a mo&s;t &s;afe and efficacious purgative. The opinion of phy&s;icians was, for &s;ome time, &s;u&s;pended by the dif|ficulty of obtaining it in a &s;tate of &s;ufficient purity. I have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavours to remove that difficulty; and by the great improvement of calcining it, which was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by Dr. Saunders, the medicine is rendered much more exten&s;ively u&s;eful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am obliged to Dr. Saunders, for his permi&s;&s;ion to in&s;ert the following note.
<P>Dr. Saunders, in his public lectures both on the practice of phy|&s;ic and chemi&s;try, has frequently recommended my proce&s;s for pre|paring Magne&s;ia, and has declared, that my Magne&s;ia was the pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;oluble of any others.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, for the information of tho&s;e readers who may not be acquainted with medi|cal &s;ubjects, that alkaline &s;alts and ab&s;orbent earths, when united with acids, have their nature entirely chang|ed, and form &s;alts of a different kind, neither acid not alkaline, which &s;alts differ according to the different acid
<PB N="13" REF="12">or alkaline employed. It has been too cu&s;tomary to con|&s;ider the action of the&s;e medicines as &s;olely confined to the ab&s;orption and neutralization of acids in the &s;tomach and bowels; whereas, when thus united, they form a combination capable of being admitted into the lacteals, and from thence into the circulation, and thus acquire the property of acting by urine and by increa&s;ing the per&s;piration.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE DISEASES IN WHICH MAGNESIA ALBA IS USEFUL.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the fir&s;t months after the birth of a child, the &s;tate of the &s;olids is lax, and the juices thin and dilute. The&s;e circum&s;tances contribute to the more ea&s;y growth of the body; yet to prevent the tone of the parts from becoming too much relaxed, nature, with that providential care which pervades her whole crea|tion, has given an acid to the &s;tomach of young animals to &s;trengthen their fibres and prevent too great a ten|dency to alkaline acrimony. But this, like her other provi&s;ions, &s;ometimes exceeds the bounds which were intended, and degenerates into a di&s;ea&s;e of an oppo&s;ite tendency to tho&s;e it was de&s;igned to prevent. From the exce&s;s of acidity in the bowels of infants, the milk is coagulated, and, by oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;tomach, becomes the &s;ource of many di&s;ea&s;es. The bowels are irritated,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the guts occa&s;ion &s;evere gripings to the tender infant, and as the nerves are, at that period, exceedingly irritable, convul&s;ions of &s;ome particular part or of the whole &s;y&s;tem are frequently the con&s;equence. Green &s;tools and &s;our vomitings di&s;cover this acidity in the bowels of young children &s;o frequent|ly, that one of the be&s;t writers on the &s;ubject of their di&s;ea&s;es, attributes the origin of all infantile di&s;orders to this cau&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harris de Morbis Infantum.</NOTE></P>
<P>Children thus affected always lo&s;e their florid com|plexion and become pale and wan. Sometimes they de|clare the &s;evere gripings which torment them, by the mo&s;t piercing cries; and &s;ometimes, when their &s;tomachs are oppre&s;&s;ed with coagulated milk or vi&s;cid phlegm, they lie in a &s;tate of &s;tupidity, refu&s;ing all nutriment. Their &s;tools and what they vomit &s;hew evident &s;igns of acidity, not only in the colour but the &s;mell.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances it is too common a practice among nur&s;es, neglecting the primary cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, to pour in hot cordials, and often to quiet the complain|ings of the infant by admini&s;tering opiates, in&s;tead of attempting to correct and carry off the acidity which occa&s;ions the di&s;order. Remove the cau&s;e and the effect will cea&s;e. To this end, where the child vomits up phlegm or coagulated milk, or appears oppre&s;&s;ed with them, it it may be proper to clear the &s;tomach by giving a grain or two of ipecacuanha, or a tea-&s;poonfull of a dilute &s;olution of emetic tartar; either of which may be admini&s;tered with great &s;afety; and after the operation
<PB N="15" REF="14">of the vomit, a &s;mall do&s;e of Magne&s;ia may be given and repeated occa&s;ionally &s;o as to keep the body of the child gently open. It is a great recommendation of Magne&s;ia, that its in&s;ipidity renders it more agreeable to infants than any other purgative; and it has this advan|tage over all the other ab&s;orbents, that it acts as an ea&s;y purgative, whereas they tend to bind and render the body co&s;tive; a &s;tate which &s;hould be &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided during infancy, for a plentiful di&s;charge by &s;tool is al|ways &s;o favourable to the health of children, that we ought to be very cautious how we ha&s;tily check even the exce&s;&s;es which may &s;ometimes happen in that evacuation. As the loo&s;ene&s;&s;es of infants are generally occa&s;ioned by &s;ome acrid &s;timulus in the bowels, they are be&s;t cured by changing the nature of the offending matter and di&s;|lodging it from its &s;eat. The method, therefore, which has been propo&s;ed above &s;hould fir&s;t be u&s;ed, before any a&s;tringents are called in to our aid.</P>
<P>The ra&s;h, commonly known by the name of the red gum, and the di&s;order called the thru&s;h or frog, which &s;o often affect children during the fir&s;t months, may in general be cured by the &s;ame treatment. In the former, &s;hould the body be too loo&s;e, oy&s;ter-&s;hell powder, or &s;halk may &s;upply the place of Magne&s;ia. In the latter, &s;ome topical application may be nece&s;&s;ary; the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormula is very efficacious.</P>
<P>Take of egg-&s;hells, cleared from the internal &s;kin or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">embrane, dried before the fire, and reduced to a fine powder, and of &s;ugar, each a quarter of an ounce, of borax <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n grains, mix them together. Let a &s;mall quantity of his be placed now and then on the child's tongue, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e may roll it about in his mouth.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>It has been a common practice to give Magne&s;ia to children as a preventive, and to mix it for this pur|po&s;e with their food, in order to correct that di&s;po&s;ition which milk and the farinaceous aliments have to turn four. This however &s;hould be done with caution, for it is only the exce&s;s of acidity which is prejudicial to infants: &s;ome degree of it is nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;hould we too officiou&s;ly and entirely de&s;troy, what we ought only to re&s;train within due bounds, we may create di&s;orders of an oppo&s;ite nature to tho&s;e we have endeavoured to prevent, and in&s;tead of an acid, produce an alkale&s;cent di&s;po&s;ition in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. Indeed, I fear that di&s;|ea&s;es have been more frequently created than obviated by the u&s;e of preventive medicines, and they &s;hould only be allowed in ca&s;es where the approach to di&s;ea&s;e is ma|nife&s;t. But when a child is in a healthy &s;tate, the be&s;t means to pre&s;erve him from a &s;uperabundant acidity, is to pay due attention to the regulation of his diet, to give him proper exerci&s;e, not to confine him too much in the foul air of hot unventilated rooms, to wa&s;h his whole body every day in cold water, and to rub him very well night and morning with a dry flannel, taking care that his &s;tomach be not too full at the time when this friction is performed.</P>
<P>Nor would I advi&s;e parents to rely with too much &s;e|curity on the virtues of this medicine, where the di&s;or|ders of their children are complicated or ob&s;tinate. The advice of the &s;agacious and di&s;tingui&s;hing practitioner will then be nece&s;&s;ary, to direct what method of treat|ment is to be pur&s;ued. Nor can I here avoid lamenting that the management of children, when di&s;ea&s;ed, is &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="16">often in the hands of nur&s;es and ignorant women, from an ab&s;urd notion that their di&s;ea&s;es are not proper &s;ub|jects of medical inve&s;tigation; when, in truth, there are none which require a clearer judgment, a quicker pene|tration, or a greater &s;hare of medical knowledge in the pre&s;criber.</P>
<P>During the period between dentition and puberty, the di&s;ea&s;es attendant on a lax fibre &s;till continue, though not &s;o predominantly as in the former &s;tage; yet ace&s;|cency is the manife&s;t cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t the concomitant of many of the complaints to which children are at this time liable. To this they are di&s;po&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the change in their diet to a more alkale&s;cent kind, by the great quantities of fruit, frequently crude and un|ripe, cakes, and other &s;weet and grea&s;y food with which they are too often indulged. By the&s;e errors, their bowels are overcharged; their dige&s;tion impaired, and the aliment remaining too long in the &s;tomach becomes &s;our, and occa&s;ions vomitings, head-achs, and other com|plaints which are thought to proceed from worms, and indeed are frequently attended with that di&s;order; as the crudities thus generated in the bowels &s;erve as a nidus for the&s;e de&s;tructive vermin. Here likewi&s;e Magne&s;ia may be of con&s;iderable advantage, as an alkaline purga|tive, neutralizing the offending acid, and at the &s;ame time promoting its di&s;charge by &s;tool. But if the &s;to|mach be overloaded with mucus, or undige&s;ted aliment, a gentle vomit ought to precede the exhibition of the Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>And even in a more advanced &s;tage of life, per&s;ons of weak habits, and who lead &s;edentary lives, are often af|flicted
<PB N="18" REF="17">with indige&s;tion, four eructations, heartburn, vo|mitings, and co&s;tivene&s;s. The&s;e di&s;orders very frequent|ly attend women during their &s;tate of pregnancy, and are &s;ometimes almo&s;t in&s;tantly removed by the u&s;e of Mag|ne&s;ia. Doctor Wat&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries, Vol. 3. p. 335.</NOTE> has publi&s;hed the ca&s;e of a pregnant woman, who was afflicted with &s;uch &s;evere vo|mitings as to bring on convul&s;ions, hiccoughing, and violent pain at her &s;tomach. What &s;he brought up was acid, and &s;o very acrimonious, as to inflame and exco|riate her mouth and throat; and the great unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he felt at her &s;tomach, upon &s;wallowing any liquor that had the lea&s;t degree of acrimony, or was more than luke|warm, made it probable that the internal &s;urface of the &s;tomach was affected in the &s;ame manner. In this de&s;pe|rate &s;ituation, after variety of remedies had been tried in vain, the &s;tomach was wa&s;hed with un&s;alted mutton broth, till the liquor was di&s;charged without any acid ta&s;te. Her pain was by this means abated, but in about two hours was apparently returning with the &s;ame vio|lence as before. This ingenious phy&s;ician then directed a drachm of Magne&s;ia to be given in mutton broth, and to be repeated as often as her pain returned, without any regard to the quantity the whole might amount to, &s;up|po&s;ing her pain to continue &s;evere. The fir&s;t do&s;e reliev|ed her, and in three days &s;he took three ounces of Mag|ne&s;ia; and in the next three days, two ounces more, by which time all her &s;ymptoms were removed. It is re|markable in this ca&s;e, that an exce&s;&s;ive purging was not
<PB N="19" REF="18">the con&s;equence of taking &s;o large a quantity of Magne|&s;ia, where there was &s;o much acid to neutralize it.</P>
<P>In bilious habits, where there is generally a di&s;po&s;ition in the &s;tomach contrary to acidity, Magne&s;ia is u&s;ually e&s;teemed to be improper, taken alone: but I am dubious whether this opinion is well founded, and many rea&s;ons for the&s;e doubts may be deduced from &s;ome experiments which have been recited in a former work.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry's Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, p. 68, and &s;eq.
<P>By the&s;e experiments it appears that Magne&s;ia, though remark|ably &s;eptic to animal fle&s;h, retards the putrefaction of bile, and re|&s;tores &s;weetne&s;s to it when actually putrid: that the&s;e la&s;t effects are &s;till more &s;trongly produced by the Calcined Magne&s;ia, which al&s;o powerfully re&s;i&s;ts the corruption of fle&s;h: that &s;ome of the other ab&s;orbents prove anti&s;eptic to bile; and, con&s;equently, that the opinion of the univer&s;al &s;eptic property of the ab&s;orbent cla&s;s of medicines, and of the impropriety of pre&s;cribing them in fevers of a putre&s;cent type, may admit of &s;ome exceptions; for as the bile is by many &s;uppo&s;ed to be the great &s;ource of putrid di&s;ea&s;es, ought not the anti&s;eptics, which are pre&s;cribed in the&s;e ca&s;es, to be &s;uch as more particularly impede the corruption of this fluid, rather than that of fle&s;h?</P></NOTE> However, where putrid bile is to be corrected and di&s;charged by &s;tool, very good purpo&s;es may, perhaps, be an&s;wered by taking the Magne&s;ia, joined with a &s;ufficient quantity of acid to neutralize it, while in a &s;tate of efferve&s;cence; or by &s;wallowing the Magne&s;ia and the acid, one imme|diately after the other, &s;o as to produce the fermentation in the &s;tomach: for thus the fixed air, with which the Magne&s;ia abounds, being let loo&s;e, may powerfully cor|rect the tendency to putridity in the contents of the pri|mae
<PB N="20" REF="19">viae, and at the &s;ame time evacuate them down|wards.</P>
<P>It is probable Magne&s;ia may be of &s;ervice in di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin. Several authors have attributed cutaneous eruptions, and indeed the antient chemi&s;ts, as has been before ob&s;erved, a&s;cribed almo&s;t all di&s;orders to the pre|&s;ence of an acid in the blood; whil&s;t others ab&s;olutely deny that an acid can be admitted into the lacteals, or if admitted, exi&s;t in the blood in a &s;tate of acidity. In the&s;e ca&s;es, however, if an acid acrimony abounds in the &s;tomach and bowels, with a co&s;tive habit, and pale com|plexion, Magne&s;ia will be a u&s;eful corrector, and enter|ing the circulation in the form of a mild neutral &s;alt, may act as an excellent alterative; or, where there is no &s;u&s;picion of acidity in the &s;tomach, an equal quantity of cream of tartar may be mixed with the Magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>HAVING thus given a cur&s;ory detail of the medicinal properties of Magne&s;ia in its natural &s;tate, I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider it in a &s;tate of calcination.</P>

<HEAD>MAGNESIA ALBA, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ON THE MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF CALCINED MAGNESIA.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH, in the preceding chapter, notice has been taken of the good effects ari&s;ing from the fixed air of the Magne&s;ia being let loo&s;e in the &s;tomach, by drinking &s;ome acid beverage immediately after the powder, in di&s;ea&s;es of a putrid tendency; yet in di&s;or|ders of a different type, and in per&s;ons of flatulent ha|bits, the di&s;charge of this air by the acid of the &s;tomach often occa&s;ions unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in the bowels, inflating and di&s;tending them over-much, inducing griping pains, and above all, a &s;en&s;e of debility or &s;inking, which is not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. In order to obviate the&s;e inconve|niences, I was induced, by the rea&s;ons mentioned in chapter fir&s;t, to deprive the Magne&s;ia of this part of its compo&s;ition by calcination. By this proce&s;s it lo&s;t &s;even twelfths of its weight, and though it produced no effer|ve&s;cence with acids, yet it had not acquired any degree of acrimony to the ta&s;te; and when thirty grains of it were diluted with a few &s;poonsful, and &s;wallowed, it oc|ca&s;ioned no unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation in my &s;tomach, nor &s;en&s;e of heat in my throat, proved nearly as aperient as a double

<PB N="21" REF="22"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="22" REF="23">quantity of uncalcined Magne&s;ia, and operated without the lea&s;t griping.</P>
<P>Thus Magne&s;ia Alba is not only dive&s;ted of the di&s;a|greeable qualities which have been alluded to, but ac|quires new properties which render it likely to an&s;wer &s;ome very important practical purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Calcareous earths, alkaline &s;alts, and Magne&s;ia, be|ing deprived of their air, attract it from every &s;ub&s;tance with which it has a &s;maller degree of affinity. The two former becoming highly cau&s;tic by the lo&s;s of their air, cannot be admini&s;tered but in very &s;mall do&s;es. But Calcined Magne&s;ia, being ab&s;olutely dive&s;ted of air, though not rendered acrimonious, and being able to ab|&s;orb a large quantity of this ela&s;tic vapour, may act more powerfully than the whole tribe of carminatives, yet e&s;&s;entially differs from them in many re&s;pects. <HI>They</HI> contain a large quantity of air; <HI>Magne&s;ia</HI> in this &s;tate is entirely free from it; <HI>Aromatics</HI> may be apt to ferment, and increa&s;e acidities; the <HI>Calcined Magne&s;ia</HI> is incapable of efferve&s;cence, and corrects an ace&s;cent di&s;po&s;ition in the ga&s;tric juices; the <HI>former</HI> con&s;tipate the belly, the <HI>latter</HI> is laxative.</P>
<P>From this property of Magne&s;ia, when calcined, of ab&s;orbing air, it occurred to me that it would, of all others, be the mo&s;t proper purgative for patients labour|ing under the &s;tone who might be taking the lixivium &s;aponarium, or &s;oap ley, having the advantage over all the vegetable purgatives, which abound with air, and con&s;equently have a tendency to render the cau&s;tic alkali mild and inert: I even flattered my&s;elf that it might co|incide
<PB N="23" REF="24">in promoting the efficacy of that powerful &s;olvent of the human calculus. Doctor Macbride's theory, that the lixivium acts by depriving the calculus of its fixed air, appears to be well founded; and Mr. Chittick, in the exhibition of his no&s;trum, which, notwith&s;tanding all his arts to di&s;gui&s;e it, is now known to have been the &s;oap ley, kept his patients from every kind of diet abounding with air. We may therefore venture to re|commend it, though not as a lithontriptic, being in&s;o|luble in water, yet as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the lixivium, by ab&s;orbing a part of that air in the primae viae, which would otherwi&s;e be attracted by the cau&s;tic alkali, and thereby render it incapable of acting on the calculus.</P>
<P>In all the di&s;ea&s;es attended with an ace&s;cent di&s;po&s;iti|on in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, in which Magne&s;ia has, in ano|ther place, been recommended, the calcined powder may be given with &s;uperior advantages, as it will not produce any of tho&s;e inconveniences which have been attributed to that medicine when uncalcined. Be&s;ides that it will act in a threefold capacity, viz. as an ab&s;orbent of air, and of acidity, and al&s;o as an ea&s;y purgative. I know &s;everal who could never bear to take the common Mag|ne&s;ia, with whom the calcined perfectly agrees. This medicine has been very &s;erviceable in flatulent cholics; and even in gouty habits, joined with &s;ome warm aro|matic, it has been found u&s;eful in correcting the very great flatulency which &s;o much afflicts per&s;ons of this con&s;titution; and the Cayenne pepper appears to be the mo&s;t proper addition to it, on account of the &s;mall quan|tity of this &s;pice that is nece&s;&s;ary to make the Magne&s;ia
<PB N="24" REF="25">gratefully warm to the &s;tomach. Hypochondriacs, and tho&s;e per&s;ons who, from leading &s;tudious and &s;edentary lives, labour under ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, and ob&s;tructions of the bowels, have generally recour&s;e, for the cure of the&s;e complaints, to warm aloetic purgatives, and with propriety, where their habits are not too full, and di&s;|po&s;ed to inflammation: but in the&s;e ca&s;es, the u&s;e of &s;uch medicines frequently induces piles, and inflamma|tory irritation; whereas the Calcined Magne&s;ia &s;ucceeds much better, correcting the acidity which is &s;o prevalent in &s;uch patients, and removing con&s;tipation, without oc|ca&s;ioning the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences of more &s;timula|ting medicines.</P>
<P>The Calcined Magne&s;ia appears, in general, to be a preferable medicine for children to the uncalcined. It is an agreeable circum&s;tance that &s;o much &s;maller a do&s;e of the former is nece&s;&s;ary, as it operates in half the quan|tity that is requi&s;ite of the latter, and proves an effectual corrector of the flatulencies which give &s;o much di&s;turb|ance to the tender bowels of infants. I have admini&s;ter|ed it to children of but few days old, with &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s, nor have I ever ob&s;erved any di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences from its u&s;e.</P>
<P>My ingenious friend Dr. Lett&s;om<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lett&s;om's Medical Memoirs, p. 139, et &s;eq.</NOTE> has related the ca&s;e of a woman, aged 43, who was &s;eized with convul|&s;ive twitchings in the left &s;ide, accompanied with a mo&s;t acute pain under the &s;hort ribs, &s;hooting towards the re|gion of the &s;tomach. She had laboured under this di&s;|ea&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="26">for about two years before her admi&s;&s;ion into the Di&s;pen&s;ary in Alder&s;gate-&s;treet. The fits attacked her two or three times a day, and generally continued from half an hour to three hours. During the paroxy&s;ms, &s;he &s;uffered the mo&s;t excruciating torture, till at length, na|ture being exhau&s;ted, &s;he &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;tupefacti|on. In &s;ome of the fits, a &s;pontaneous vomiting termi|nated them &s;ooner, but no particular matter was ejected.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides bleeding, bli&s;tering, and laxative medicines, &s;he had tried a great variety of remedies in vain. Dr. Lett&s;om, from the frequent eructations of wind, joined with the other &s;ymptoms, judiciou&s;ly concluded that fla|tulence in the &s;tomach and bowels principally excited this direful di&s;ea&s;e; and that be&s;ides opiates to quiet the convul&s;ive motions, it was nece&s;&s;ary to ab&s;orb the &s;uper|abundant air that &s;eemed detached in the&s;e vi&s;cera, and &s;ometimes di&s;tended them &s;en&s;ibly to the touch.</P>
<P>An emetic was pre&s;cribed to be taken every week, and in order to ab&s;orb the fixed air which might be ac|cumulated in the inte&s;tines, and to correct acidity, &s;he was directed to take four ounces of lime water, and al&s;o two drachms of Calcined Magne&s;ia three times a day, and one drachm of the Paregoric elixir was exhibited once a day at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>By the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, and due attention to her diet, &s;he experienced ea&s;e the fir&s;t week; the fits gradually dimini&s;hed in violence and in frequency, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n two months nearly &s;ub&s;ided; at which time the elixir was omitted. She continued to take Calcined Magne&s;ia and lime-water for a week afterwards, and &s;ince &s;he was
<PB N="26" REF="27">di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital, the Doctor a&s;&s;ures us that her health has remained uninterrupted, without the u&s;e of any medicine.</P>
<P>Calcined Magne&s;ia is a medicine very well adapted to counteract the co&s;tivene&s;s occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of the Bath, Tunbridge, and Bri&s;tol waters; and may be a convenient &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;aline purging waters, be|ing taken in &s;mall do&s;es, wa&s;hed down with a large draught of pure water, or, in ca&s;es where acidity does not prevail in the &s;tomach, of lemonade or any acidu|lated liquor.</P>
<P>As a preparative for the &s;mall-pox, few medicines can be given to infants preferable to Calcined Magne|&s;ia. And from its anti&s;eptic property, or power of re|&s;i&s;ting the putrefaction of fle&s;h and of bile, it &s;eems well de&s;erving the attention of practitioners, as a purga|tive in putrid di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>GENERAL DIRECTIONS RELATIVE TO THE DOSES OF MAGNESIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE following general directions may be u&s;eful, in re&s;pect to the do&s;es of Calcined Magne&s;ia. But it is to be remembered, that a double quantity of the Uncalcined Magne&s;ia will be requi&s;ite to produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>A child during the month may take from three to &s;ix grains of Calcined Magne&s;ia; and the do&s;e may be re|peated, at proper intervals, till a &s;ufficient number of &s;tools be obtained.</P>
<P>Children during the time they are cutting their teeth may take five, ten, or twenty grains of the Calcined Powder, in proportion as it is intended to act as a purga|tive, or only as an alterative. As they advance in years, the do&s;e mu&s;t be increa&s;ed accordingly.</P>
<P>The do&s;es for adults, as well as for children, mu&s;t dif|fer greatly, according to their different con&s;titutions, or the degree of acidity in their &s;tomachs. It may be pro|per therefore to begin with &s;maller do&s;es, and to increa&s;e them if nece&s;&s;ary. In general, twenty or thirty grains
<PB N="28" REF="29">will be &s;ufficient to procure a gentle purging for an adult per&s;on, who is ea&s;ily moved; but much larger do&s;es may be nece&s;&s;ary for the more robu&s;t. While acidity prevails in the &s;tomach, and occa&s;ions co&s;tivene&s;s, heartburn, and vomiting, the do&s;e is only to be regulated by the effects which the medicine produces.</P>
<P>The Magne&s;ia is much more agreeable, when mixed well with the vehicle in which it is taken; to this end, only &s;uch a quantity of water &s;hould be added to it, at fir&s;t, as may be nece&s;&s;ary to reduce it to a pa&s;te, which &s;hould be rubbed till it be quite &s;mooth, and then gradu|ally diluted.</P>
<P>Water &s;weetened with &s;ugar, milk and water, or al|mond milk, are proper liquids in which to mix the pow|der. To children it may be given mixed with their food, in &s;uch a manner as not to be perceived by them.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t people are now provided with &s;cales and weights for weighing gold, it may be proper to mention the proportions which the&s;e weights bear to tho&s;e u&s;ed by the apothecaries. Two penny-weights are equal to 120 grains, or two drachms; and the grain weights, each of which contain as many grains as there are <HI>round</HI> marks on the &s;urface, are exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e by which medicines are weighed. The money weights which are marked with the names of the &s;everal coins, bear the following proportions, viz. that marked one guinea, contains 129 grains, or 9 grains above two drachms; that marked 10s. 6d. &s;ixty-four grains and a half, or four and half grains above one drachm, &amp;c.
<PB N="29" REF="30">So that the quantities of Magne&s;ia to be given may thus be accurately determined.</P>
<P>But where weights are wanting, the quantity may be mea&s;ured in a tea-&s;poon; one of a moderate &s;ize contains about &s;ix grains, upon a level with the edge of the &s;poon; and when headed up, about twenty grains.</P>
