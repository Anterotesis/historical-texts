<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE SURGEONS <HI>of</HI> London.</HEAD>
<P>THE Barbers of the City of <HI>London</HI> were incorporated by King <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Edw. IV. 1461.</NOTE> in order to promote and improve the Science and Faculty of Surgery, upon Con&s;ideration of the many pub|lick Mi&s;chiefs which had ari&s;en from the Ignorance and Un&s;kil|fulne&s;s of Per&s;ons practi&s;ing that Art.</P>
<P>To remedy &s;uch Evils for the Time to come, which the Charter recites to have been owing to the Want of a proper Over&s;ight, Correction, and Puni&s;hment of &s;uch as were not &s;ufficiently &s;killed in the Faculty of Sur|gery, the My&s;tery and Commonalty of Barbers were created a Body Cor|porate, with Power to make proper Statutes and Ordinances for their good Government.</P>
<P>And the Ma&s;ters and Governors of that Company were to have the Over&s;ight, Correction, and Government of all Per&s;ons u&s;ing the My&s;tery of Surgeons, within the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Suburbs thereof; and the Puni&s;hment of them, for their Offences, in improperly exerci&s;ing and practi&s;ing their Art; and likewi&s;e the Over&s;ight and In&s;pection of all In&s;truments, Plai&s;ters, and other Medicines, by them u&s;ed.</P>
<P>And, in order to attain the End of their In&s;titution, no Per&s;ons what|&s;oever were to be admitted or received into their Company, except Per|&s;ons &s;ufficiently &s;killed and in&s;tructed in the Art of Surgery.</P>
<P>This Charter was afterwards confirmed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIth, in the 15th Year of his Reign, and by King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, in the 2d Year of his Reign.</P>
<P>In the 32d Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, when Per&s;ons of better Educa|tion, and greater Abilities, began to apply them&s;elves to the Study and Practice of Surgery, the Legi&s;lature thought proper to unite this Com|pany, which were &s;till all Surgeons, and, by the Terms of their Charter, could be compo&s;ed of no other Per&s;ons, with another Body of Men, likewi&s;e practi&s;ing Surgery, but not incorporated.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>The Act recites, That there then were, within the City of <HI>London,</HI> Two &s;everal and di&s;tinct Companies of Surgeons, occupying and exerci&s;ing the Science and Faculty of Surgery; the one Company called <HI>The Bar|bers of</HI> London, the other called <HI>The Surgeons of</HI> London.</P>
<P>And the End propo&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature in uniting the&s;e Two di&s;tinct Companies of Surgeons, and making them One Body Corporate, is de|clared to be, That, by their Union and frequent A&s;&s;embly together, the good and due Order, Exerci&s;e, and Knowledge in the Science and Fa|culty of Surgery, &s;hould be, as well in Speculation as in Practice, obtained, both to them&s;elves and their Apprentices.</P>
<P>The Legi&s;lature then thought proper likewi&s;e to Enact, for particular Rea&s;ons mentioned in the Act, That, for the future, the &s;ame Per&s;ons &s;hould not practi&s;e both as Surgeons and Barbers, but that, from thence|forth, they &s;hould be &s;eparated Profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Surgeons having, &s;ince the Making of that Act, been more libe|rally and regularly educated, have directed and applied their whole Study and Attention towards the Advancement and Improvement of their Art.</P>
<P>The Barbers have ever &s;ince been engaged in a different Way of Bu&s;ine&s;s, altogether foreign to the Practice of Surgery.</P>
<P>It is evident therefore, that neither the Ends, which the Crown had in view at the original Incorporation of this Company, or tho&s;e which were afterwards propo&s;ed to be attained by the Legi&s;lature, can be an|&s;wered by their continuing united in the &s;ame Body.</P>
<P>As the &s;ole End of their Incorporation was, that they &s;hould over&s;ee and &s;uperintend the Practice of Surgery; and as the Legi&s;lature pro|po&s;ed, that, by their Meeting and A&s;&s;embly together, the Science of Surgery &s;hould be promoted, as well in Speculation as in Practice; it is plain, that their whole Union and Meeting with the Barbers, if it were no Ob&s;tacle, cannot in the lea&s;t be any Ways conducive towards attain|ing tho&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>But, if the Surgeons were incorporated, as a di&s;tinct Body, by them|&s;elves, they would not then be deprived of the Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of many ingenious Practi&s;ers of their Profe&s;&s;ion, who, at pre&s;ent, decline being Members of a Company, the Majority of which, being Strangers to their Art, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have in their Views the Advance|ment and Improvement of it.</P>
<P>The Majority of Per&s;ons practi&s;ing Surgery, would not then be di&s;|couraged and prevented, as they now are, from being Members of the Company, by the Inconveniencies and Expences which nece&s;&s;arily attend the Execution of the &s;everal Offices of the pre&s;ent Company, which have no Relation to the Improvement and Profe&s;&s;ion of Surgery; by which
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">Means, tho&s;e who practi&s;e Surgery are again divided, contrary to the Intention of the Legi&s;lature: The Number of the&s;e, at pre&s;ent, who are not Members of the Company, being almo&s;t double the Number of tho&s;e who are.</P>
<P>The Publick Lectures, Examinations of Surgeons, and other A&s;&s;em|blies, in&s;tituted for the Advancement of Surgery, would not then meet with any Interruption from Per&s;ons, only Barbers, in&s;i&s;ting, as they now do, that they &s;hall always be pre&s;ent at &s;uch Meetings.</P>
<P>Since therefore, there are di&s;tinct and peculiar Privileges and Powers lodged with the Surgeons, which the Barbers ought neither to take Part or Trouble in; particularly that important Tru&s;t, of examining Surgeons for the Royal Navy, which they have duly executed with the greate&s;t Chearfulne&s;s, to the great Advantage, as they hope, of the Publick:</P>
<P>And, as the de&s;ired Separation is founded upon Rea&s;ons of general and publick Utility;</P>
<P>The Surgeons of <HI>London</HI> humbly pray, To be &s;eparated from the Barbers, as tho&s;e of other Countries have been, each to be made an inde|pendent Corporation, and ve&s;ted with the &s;ame Privileges which they now enjoy under their pre&s;ent Charters.</P>
<P>And, as all the Members of the pre&s;ent Company have an equal Intere&s;t in the Property belonging to the &s;aid Company; and the original Members, who fir&s;t acquired that Property, could only be Per&s;ons &s;killed in Surgery (tho&s;e, practi&s;ing as Barbers only, not having been Members of this Company till the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth); they hope, That an equitable and proportionable Divi&s;ion and Di&s;tribution of their Property &s;hall be made, in &s;uch Manner as the Legi&s;lature &s;hall think fit.</P>
