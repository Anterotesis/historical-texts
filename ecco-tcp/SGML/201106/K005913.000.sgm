<P>THOUGH I have not the honour of being known to any one of you, I think I cannot addre&s;s the fol|lowing pages but to you.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on who is &s;ick and takes medi|cines is &s;en&s;ible of the relief he meets with from them, and therefore is the be&s;t judge of their merit and efficacy: but God be prai&s;ed for his goodne&s;s to us poor mortals, the di&s;coveries and improvements I have made in treating the Gout and Rheumati&s;m are &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that while they meet with the ble&s;&s;ings of the afflicted, they can abide the &s;evere&s;t examination of you gentlemen of
<PB N="2" REF="4">the faculty, which emboldens me to lay this account before you.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ent you with only a few ca&s;es out of a great number; the&s;e will &s;erve to &s;hew you what has been done; and as &s;everal patients have applied to me &s;ince I have been in this city, whom I have not yet had lei&s;ure, on account of other bu&s;ine&s;s, to attend, I may hereafter lay before you &s;ome ob&s;ervations made on the &s;pot, when I have compleated tho&s;e affairs that to me are more material; and for your further &s;atisfaction, and for the &s;atisfaction of the public, you may then ex|amine my patients before I begin with them, vi&s;it them under the operation of the me|dicines, and &s;ee the event.</P>
<P>Some of the following ca&s;es are well known to &s;everal gentlemen in London; one of the patients (Captain Samuel Bayard) is now in town, and may be examined on the &s;ubject; and I could moreover refer to a phy&s;ician of eminence, at pre&s;ent in this city, who can, if he plea&s;es, give a full and &s;atisfactory ac|count of the&s;e matters, as he attended &s;everal of my patients while under cure; and I openly and hone&s;tly communicated to him, for his candid behaviour to me, the medi|cines I u&s;e in the Gout, Rheumati&s;m, and other ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es; and I find he has made &s;ome con&s;iderable cures with them in the&s;e countries.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<P>It will be no di&s;advantage, I hope, in your eyes, that the per&s;on whom providence made the in&s;trument of the&s;e di&s;coveries, was not regularly brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s of phy&s;ic; <HI>for the race is not to the &s;wi&s;t, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> My own ill health fir&s;t made me read phy&s;ic: I afterwards &s;earched into chemi&s;try and the virtues of plants, and made numberle&s;s weari&s;ome ex|periments in tho&s;e ways, and on human bodies in &s;ickne&s;s and in health; by which means, I fell upon &s;ome of the medicines I now u&s;e with &s;uch uncommon &s;ucce&s;s in various &s;tubborn, and till now, incurable maladies.</P>
<P>In the year 1754, I was called to a gen|tleman, who was threatned with a morti|fication while he was in a violent fit of the Gout. He had been frequently attacked with the Gout, and at this time was greatly af|flicted with it in the wri&s;t, fingers, feet, an|cles and knees. I gave him &s;ome medicines to prevent the impending mortification; and, to my great &s;urprize, that was not only ef|fected, but in a few days all the gouty com|plaints went off, which he informed me u&s;ed to continue between two and three months. This unexpected &s;ucce&s;s encoura|ged me to pur&s;ue the lucky hint, and I have ever &s;ince that time made many experiments in relation to the Gout and the means to re|lieve
<PB N="4" REF="6">or cure it, till I brought the practice to the pre&s;ent degree of certainty and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>That you may kindly receive this account of a new di&s;covery, and that it may here|after, by your &s;uperior abilities, be made more u&s;eful to the afflicted, is the hearty wi&s;h of</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE GOUT AND RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE Gout has been &s;o long e&s;teemed an incurable di&s;order, that mankind have at la&s;t brought them&s;elves to think an attempt to cure it to be imprudent, as well as imprac|ticable; as if it was more advantageous to enjoy health for nine months in the year at the &s;evere penance of a painful illne&s;s the other three, than, by eradicating the cau&s;e of tho&s;e evils, to pa&s;s the whole year in full vigour and &s;trength. This ab&s;urd notion puts me in mind of what I have read &s;ome|where of the inhabitants of the Alps, who being in general &s;ubject to mon&s;trous &s;wel|lings about the throat, look upon tho&s;e hor|rid deformities as &s;o many real beauties. It is a comfort indeed that we can thus draw plea&s;ure out of pain, and per&s;uade our&s;elves that what we cannot obtain would be im|proper for us to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>For my part, I do not pretend to cure the Gout &s;o that it will never return; but I am by no means convinced that it is impo&s;&s;ible to do it. I do not pretend to do it, becau&s;e the experience I have had is not long enough to warrant me to &s;ay &s;o, or to think &s;o; and yet the experience I have had gives me great
<PB N="6" REF="8">rea&s;on to imagine it not impo&s;&s;ible. It is upon experience alone that I ground my judgment and my rea&s;oning upon the&s;e mat|ters. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the nature of the Gouty matter, and how it is formed in the body, or how the fits of the Gout are brought on, for all that is mere theory and &s;uppo&s;ition; I &s;hall only argue from what I have &s;een and from what I have done. We may &s;ay of the Gout what we do of Fevers, Pleuri&s;ies, Agues, Drop&s;ies, Jaundice, &amp;c. that though they be once cured they may re|turn again: but, for my part, experience, and plain rea&s;oning from it, authori&s;e me to carry the matter much further; and I can readily conceive, that the con&s;titution and habit of body of Gouty per&s;ons, which di&s;po&s;e them to the di&s;order, may, by the u&s;e of medicines, be &s;o amended, altered, and as it were changed, (like unto that of a healthy per&s;on who never had the Gout) that it will never afterwards, or at lea&s;t for a long time, generate or collect any Gouty matter. Now to judge whether this can be done let experience be our guide. Many things have been recommended as infallible for radically curing the Gout; but what happened on u&s;e|ing them? Some of them indeed prevented the returns of the di&s;order, but then, as far as I can find, the patient never enjoyed &s;ound and &s;trong health; from whence it is plain tho&s;e things did not cure, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="7" REF="9">di&s;order: Now, on the contrary, if the pa|tient had become active, vigorous, &s;trong and robu&s;t, we might pronounce the medi|cines were truly beneficial, and the end pro|po&s;ed to be properly an&s;wered by them. With regard to the medicines I u&s;e, I mu&s;t hone&s;t|ly confe&s;s that many of my patients have had returns of the Gout &s;ince I fir&s;t took them in hand, (but not oftner, nor indeed &s;o often, as before) &s;o that all the merit of the medi|cines in tho&s;e ca&s;es con&s;i&s;ted in completely carrying off a fit in &s;ome intermediate time, from two days to about twelve, according to the violence of the di&s;order and con&s;titution of the per&s;on that in all appearance would have tortured the patient for two or three months. But whether the return of the di&s;|order in the&s;e patients was owing to their irregularity in the u&s;e of the medicines, or to the in&s;ufficiency of the medicines to work a thorough change in the con&s;titution, I can|not pretend to &s;ay; I &s;peak only what I know: I have, however, had other patients who u&s;ed to be afflicted with a fit once or twice in a year, or in two years, but who after going through a cour&s;e of my medicines regularly, and living prudently for &s;ometime afterwards, have never had a return, but grown hearty and &s;trong, as indeed every Gouty per&s;on who took them have done. It is now above twelve years &s;ince I admini&s;tred the medicines to &s;ome of the&s;e patients, and
<PB N="8" REF="10">it is from thence that I am inclined to think a radical cure may be made, though, as I &s;aid before, the &s;hort experience of &s;o few years will not allow me to be intirely of that opinion, much more to affirm it as a fact; and therefore, notwith&s;tanding the proba|bility of the thing, I leave it to time and fur|ther experience to determine, whether the Gout can be radically cured or not.</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay thus much to prevent people being carried away with wrong notions of things, or forming wrong notions of what I &s;ay; but after all, all I know by experience is, that the&s;e medicines complete|ly carry off the pre&s;ent regular fit with expe|dition and &s;afety; but that, where the di&s;or|der is le&s;t to it&s;elf, nature &s;eldom makes a perfect de&s;pumation of the Gouty matter, which I take to be the rea&s;on that one fit comes &s;o quickly upon the back of another, and that the joints are &s;o greatly injured by the di&s;order: whereas, by the&s;e medicines, the body is perfectly cleared of the Gouty particles, the next fit does not come on &s;o &s;oon, and the limbs and joints are pre&s;erved. I know too by experience that they bring the irregular Gout to be regular, or expel it the body without going through tho&s;e regu|lar &s;tages, as frequently happens where the Gout affects the head, &s;tomach or bowels: and I al&s;o know by experience that they cure the &s;wellings, &s;tiffne&s;s, and contractions of
<PB N="9" REF="11">the limbs, which are occa&s;ioned by catching cold in the fit, or by the long continuance or frequent return of the di&s;order. As for the Sciatica and Rheumati&s;m, they are in gene|ral &s;o nearly allied to the Gout, that I need &s;ay nothing about them.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked how the medicines work upon the body to perform &s;uch cures with &s;o much ea&s;e to the patient; to which I an|&s;wer, that I don't know, nor don't care. Facts &s;peak for them&s;elves, and put it be|yond all doubt, that &s;uch cures have been wrought, and I am ready to &s;hew before any body that they may be done again; but put|ting the evidence of facts out of the que&s;tion, I would beg to a&s;k tho&s;e gentlemen who are for judging of the practicability of things by the weak powers of human rea&s;on, whether it is not accu&s;ing the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of Providence, who has enriched this world with thou&s;ands of plants to nou|ri&s;h our bodies and relieve our infirmities, to &s;uppo&s;e that he has left us de&s;titute of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Gout? or is it not more rea|&s;onable to think, that, amid&s;t the va&s;t varie|ty of plants he hath created for our u&s;e, he may have endued &s;ome with virtues and powers to cure this the mo&s;t painful and grievous di&s;ea&s;e mankind is liable to, though their manner of operation &s;hould be conceal|ed from us? Intermitting Fevers and Agues puzzled the faculty before the Peruvian Bark
<PB N="10" REF="12">was known in Europe; the bite of the Rat|tle Snake is mortal in a few hours; the be&s;t phy&s;icians and Surgeons cannot check the poi&s;on, but the Indians have taught us to cure it with a common herb.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e poor Savages the American Indians, with no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than experience, and the natural light of rea&s;on, have cured many di&s;ea&s;es that baffled the mo&s;t ingenious of the faculty. In Sinous Ulcers they make a de|coction of certain herbs and roots, with which they bath and wa&s;h the Ulcers, pour|ing part of it into the cavities; the&s;e appli|cations &s;oon &s;often and di&s;&s;olve the hardne&s;s, new fle&s;h &s;prouts up, and the Ulcer heals. I have attempted to imitate their practice in this re&s;pect, and have &s;ucceeded in it in &s;ome ca&s;es of fi&s;tulas of the Anus, and particular|ly in one who had been cut in vain. The u&s;e of the Seneca Snake-root, and &s;ome other medicines we learned from the Indians, need not be mentioned to prove their knowledge of u&s;eful herbs. By the abu&s;e of &s;trong li|quor, they are much troubled with ner|vous di&s;ea&s;es, that in women occa&s;ion mi&s;|carriages, and many other female com|plaints; for all which they take a decoction of an Aromatic-root, that is of great &s;ervice. I have given it my&s;elf in Nervous ca&s;es, and have experienced better effects from it than f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om any vegetable or chemical medicine I ever tried. This root is very difficult to be
<PB N="11" REF="13">got, growing only in particular places; and it is of &s;o delicate a nature, that it does not retain its virtues &s;o long as one could wi&s;h. The Indians are much expo&s;ed to cold, and frequently have their hearing much hurt by it, which they cure with the juice of a certain herb mixed with Bear's grea&s;e, or fi&s;h oil, and put into the ears. Some who have tri|ed it told me that it excited the &s;en&s;ation of an explo&s;ive noi&s;e in the ear, which opened the organ, after which their hearing return|ed: but the mo&s;t curious thing in their prac|tice, that I have &s;een, is the different kinds of baths (I mean baths prepared from diffe|rent herbs) and ways of &s;weating for diffe|rent di&s;ea&s;es: with the&s;e and the decoctions they give the patient to drink at the &s;ame time, they do wonders in many di&s;ea&s;es. There is now in London a per&s;on of indi&s;|putable veracity, who had the operation of &s;weating performed upon him by an Indian for a violent tooth-ach, and pain in the face, he had been long troubled with, which was &s;oon and &s;o effectually removed that he has never had the lea&s;t return of it &s;ince.</P>

<P>MR. THOMAS WHITE, Merchant. This gentleman was about forty years old when he became my patient; about eight years before, he was attacked, for the fir&s;t time, with the Gout; he had &s;everal fits in the following years; for two or three years pa&s;t the fits were very violent, and u&s;ually continued from &s;ix weeks to two months, &s;ometimes three months, before he was able to walk abroad. Eight months before I &s;aw him he was taken with an intermitting fever: in that di&s;order he complained of a pain in the right &s;ide, which grew more trouble&s;ome at times afterwards. The next fit of the gout came on with its u&s;ual vio|lence, and the pain in his right &s;ide returned with it. In the nights his pains became &s;o violent, as not only to deprive him of &s;leep, but almo&s;t of his &s;en&s;es. The di&s;order had continued about three days before the medi|cines were given, and in ten days after the fir&s;t do&s;e he walked to the coffee hou&s;e; no|thing but a &s;light tenderne&s;s in the &s;oles of his feet remaining, which al&s;o &s;oon went off: and what is remarkable, he never felt any thing of the pain in his &s;ide &s;ince. He con|tinued perfectly &s;trong, hearty, and active for four years, without refraining from tho&s;e in|dulgencies which a ho&s;pitable, &s;ocial, and
<PB N="13" REF="15">friendly di&s;po&s;ition led him into. He then underwent &s;uch another fit as the above, and from that time he has al&s;o enjoyed the &s;ame firm &s;tate of health as before.</P>
<P>Mr. LEASHELEAR, being attacked with pains in the feet, re&s;embling the fir&s;t fits of the Gout, &s;ent for a doctor, who gave him the volatile tincture of Guaicum, and appli|ed pultices to his feet, which repelled the di&s;order into his brea&s;t, neck, and head, with &s;uch violence, that he was thought to be ex|piring. The medicines I admini&s;tred relieved him in two days; but in cro&s;&s;ing a wide ferry before he had recovered his &s;trength, he caught cold and had a relap&s;e, which, how|ever, was carried off in two or three days by the &s;ame medicines, and he has from that time continued perfectly well, active, and &s;trong.</P>
<P>JAMES LOWEY, aged about 70 years, had been bedridden, at times, for &s;everal months with the Hip Gout. He had tried many practitioners, and taken various medicines, but could get no relief. His thigh and leg were dimini&s;hed. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, I admini&s;tred things to him, and in proce&s;s of time the thigh and leg recovered their &s;ize and &s;trength, and he came to walk as well as ever.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="16">
<P>Capt. SAMUEL BAYARD, aged 60, about 23 years ago was attacked with the Gout, and from that time, till he applied to me, commonly had a fit once a year, or there|abouts. During the fit he not only had vio|lent pains in all his limbs, but in his &s;tomach and bowels. The fits &s;eldom went off in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks, but in general they con|tinued much longer, as two or three months. He always lived high and free. From the very fir&s;t fit his feet and hands never recovered their natural feeling, but were dry, hard, and &s;caly, with great heat in them; and this, as well in the intervals between the fits, as in the fit it&s;elf. His knees and ancles at la&s;t were enlarged, his feet and toes always &s;welled, and all tho&s;e joints were &s;o weak and &s;tiff that he could &s;carce move them; walking, as he ex|pre&s;&s;ed it, as if he had no joints, or as if his legs and feet were made of wood. His wri&s;ts, hands, and fingers, were not quite &s;o bad, though in a &s;imilar condition, his fingers particularly being &s;o &s;tiff that he could not by any means extend them out &s;trait, nor bend them without difficulty: all this while he was much troubled with the gravel, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;mall &s;tones. When he appli|ed to me in January, 1760, he was in the height of a fit: the fir&s;t night I did nothing, the &s;econd I gave him &s;ome medicines, the day following he was free of pain, and in a few days more began to walk about the
<PB N="15" REF="17">room. By continuing the medicines a fort|night, his feet and hands began to regain their natural feeling, the hardne&s;s, heat, and dryne&s;s going off; and in about &s;ix weeks or two months his limbs and joints became &s;o pliant, that he walked with as much ea&s;e as before he had the Gout. He went on, however, taking the medicines for &s;everal weeks longer. Since that time he has felt &s;o little of the Gravel, that, as he &s;ays, it was not worth notice. Two years after this cour&s;e for the Gout he had a &s;light touch of the Gravel, and being co&s;tive, took an opening medicine when he went to bed, and drank &s;ome warm whey after it: but con|trary to my directions, to take it upon an empty &s;tomach, he made a very hearty &s;up|per, which, with the medicine and the whey di&s;agreeing with his &s;tomach and bow|els, occa&s;ioned it to work &s;ooner than was intended: he fell into a &s;weat, and the me|dicine beginning to operate downwards, he very imprudently got up, with the &s;weat upon him, and went to a nece&s;&s;ary in the yard. The night was very cold and wet; he was &s;uddenly &s;truck with a Pal&s;y of all the left &s;ide of his body; for five of &s;ix days he had violent pains in that &s;ide, but none in the other: the whole &s;ide gradually wither|ed, and became emaciated. He was con|fined to his bed for &s;ome weeks; the wither|ed parts at la&s;t began to recover their plump|ne&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="18">and &s;trength, and, with my be&s;t endeavours, it was about three months before he regained his &s;trength, and walked with his u&s;ual firm|ne&s;s. From that time to the pre&s;ent he has enjoyed perfect health and the free u&s;e of his limbs. He is now as well as any man of his years. His hands have their natural feeling, his feet per&s;pire freely, his joints are of their natural &s;ize, he has had no pain in his &s;to|mach or bowels, his appetite is good, and he &s;leeps well. He has had nothing of the Gou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ince I fir&s;t took him in hand till within the&s;e &s;ix months, that he once or twice felt &s;light twichings in his feet, but they went off di|rectly with a copious per&s;piration on the parts.</P>
<P>I SAMUEL BAYARD, now in London, hav|ing read the above account, declare it to be true in every particular, and am ready, if re|quired, to atte&s;t the &s;ame; and that &s;everal other Gouty per&s;ons, whom I am well ac|quainted with, have received great benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Mr. Flower.</P>

He did &s;o for about four weeks: in that time his legs were &s;omewhat reduced, and the motion of his joints became ea&s;ier and freer, but the&s;e al|terations were of &s;hort continuance; for in two or three months his joints and legs re|lap&s;ed nearly into their old &s;tate. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the medicines brought his irre|gular pains to a regular though &s;light fit, which was &s;oon relieved: after this he had much le&s;s pain, and enjoyed much better health.</P>

He was perfectly cured of a Fit of the Gout in eight or ten days, and is now in a better &s;tate of health than he has been in from the fir&s;t attack, hav|ing
<PB N="18" REF="20">felt nothing of the Gout or Rheumati&s;m ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mrs. ROSEVELT, aged 54, had been trou|bled many years with violent Rheumatic and Hy&s;teric complaints: her hands and fingers were greatly deprived of their motion, and the joints of the fingers were con&s;iderably en|larged and contracted; &s;everal of the faculty had attempted to relieve her. She had al&s;o tried a variety of things recommended by her acquaintances; from &s;ome of which &s;he re|ceived a little temporary relief. After a cour&s;e of the&s;e medicines her pains became ea&s;ier, and &s;he acquired the u&s;e of her hands and fingers, the &s;wellings that were upon them being &s;oftened and dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Captain HICKEY, aged about 38. This gentleman for &s;everal years had been afflict|ed, at lea&s;t once a year, with a violent fit of the Gout. Latterly it &s;eized his arms, hands and knees as well as feet. The&s;e fits not on|ly confined him to his bed or room for two months or more, but even after the fit was gone off he was liable to have &s;hort but pain|ful returns of the di&s;order upon catching the lea&s;t cold. He was cured of the fit in le&s;s than half of the time it u&s;ually took to go off, and has not felt any thing like the returns of it,
<PB N="19" REF="21">which formerly happened upon being expo|&s;ed to the cold.</P>
<P>Captain PAVEY, aged about 50, had been &s;ubject to the Gout about 18 years. While he was in a frontier garri&s;on, in 1759, he was &s;eized with a violent return of the di&s;order in his hands, knees and feet, and from the badne&s;s of the accommodations at that place &s;uffered greatly. The di&s;order, in|&s;tead of going off in about &s;ix or eight weeks, as u&s;ual, confined him almo&s;t entirely for four months to his bed; and though his pains by that time became le&s;s violent and con&s;tant, they &s;till continued to afflict him. His an|cles, feet and toes became thicker, and grew &s;o weak and &s;tiff that he could not walk with|out great unea&s;ine&s;s and difficulty. In this condition he was brought to town in 1761. He took the medicines, and lived very regu|larly for about four weeks, and received &s;o much benefit from them, that, being able to walk or go abroad with greater ea&s;e and fa|cility, he met with too many temptations not to be guilty of &s;ome intemperance: but not|with&s;tanding the&s;e irregularities, and repeat|ed neglects in taking his medicines, in about two months, from the time he began to take them, he got almo&s;t rid of the frequent pains he had been troubled with &s;ince the la&s;t fit; his ancles, &amp;c. became le&s;s, the joints grew
<PB N="20" REF="22">&s;tronger and more &s;upple, and he might now have walked with firmne&s;s and ea&s;e on any ground, but for a pointed hardne&s;s or corn|like &s;ub&s;tance on the ball of the great toe, that gave him pain whenever, in walking the &s;treets, he happened to tread on a round &s;tone. In May following he went to &s;ea, and was 28 days on his pa&s;&s;age to Bri&s;tol; during the voyage he was very well, hearty and lived free. A few weeks after his arrival in England he had a &s;light fit of the Gout, the pains were but trifling, and in three days, his feet hav|ing &s;weat plentifully, the di&s;order went en|tirely off. He continued after that perfectly well, and felt no inconveniency or pain but what the induration occa&s;ioned when he hap|pened to tread directly upon it: he found him|&s;elf indeed &s;o well and hearty, that he thought of procuring a commi&s;&s;ion again in the army, which he had quitted on account of being rendered unfit for &s;ervice by this di&s;order.</P>
<P>I am far from thinking this gentleman is cured of the Gout, but I am per&s;uaded, that if he had behaved with more regularity the time he was taking the medicines, he would have re|ceived relief &s;ooner, and continued a longer time free from a return of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Captain VALENTINE, aged about 50. This gentleman had always indulged too much in &s;ocial plea&s;ures to e&s;cape the Gout:
<PB N="21" REF="23">for &s;everal years he had been very much &s;ub|ject to it: the attacks of it were &s;ometimes regular and of a longer or &s;horter duration: the la&s;t fit happened when he commanded a Privateer, and was on a crui&s;e at &s;ea: his arms, wri&s;ts, fingers, knees, ancles, feet and toes were cruelly afflicted: he was confined on &s;hip board to his bed about three or four months, and was afterwards grievou&s;ly trou|bled with pains in all the above mentioned parts. Tho&s;e joints were all &s;welled, and &s;o &s;tiff and weak, that he could not write, and he fed him&s;elf and walked with great diffi|culty. In this condition he had been &s;everal months when he &s;ent to me. He took the medicines with &s;ome interruption about four months, and by that time regained, in a great mea&s;ure, the u&s;e of his limbs, and got quit of his pains; the thickne&s;s of &s;ome of his joints went off, in others it was much re|duced: he got a good appetite, a good heal|thy complexion, &s;lept well, and walked with ea&s;e and firmne&s;s. This happened in 1761: &s;ince that time he has had a fit or two, which went off in two or three days, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from medicine.</P>
<P>Mr. WILLIAM DARLINGTON, Wine Merchant, aged 45 years, had been &s;everely afflicted with the Gout, once or twice a year, for 15 years. For two or three years pa&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="24">his legs were frequently &s;welled, and his an|cles and upper part of the feet, for the mo&s;t part of that time, were much enlarged and weaker than formerly. One leg was much more &s;welled than the other, and had &s;everal Scorbutic Ulcers upon it. The former fits of the Gout u&s;ually la&s;ted eight or ten weeks. He had laboured under the pre&s;ent attack about four days when I was called to him, and from the violence of the &s;ymptoms ima|gined it would continue the u&s;ual time: he took the medicines regularly; the pains were carried off in 24 hours; the thickne&s;s and &s;wellings of his leg, ancles and feet, which had la&s;ted &s;o long, dimini&s;hed gradually; his appetite, &s;trength and &s;pirits returned; and he was able to walk about the hou&s;e in 10 days: his feet continued tender, though free of pain, for a few days longer: but at the end of the fortnight he put on a pair of &s;mal|ler &s;hoes than he had wore for &s;ome years, and went abroad about his bu&s;ine&s;s. He has con|tinued active, &s;trong and hearty, without any illne&s;s whatever, or the lea&s;t return either of his Gouty or Scorbutic complaints, though it is now above five years &s;ince he applied to me. He is much accu&s;tomed to &s;tamp his feet with all his force, to &s;hew how &s;trong and free of di&s;orders they are.</P>
<P>JOHN DUNSCOMB, Wine Merchant, 52 years of age, almo&s;t every &s;pring and fall for
<PB N="23" REF="25">near 20 years had been tormented with the Gout: he &s;eldom got the better of a fit in le&s;s than two months, and they frequently continu|ed longer. In the winter, 1760, he was taken with a return of the di&s;order in his hands, knees, and feet, attended with violent pains in his &s;tomach, bowels, hips, &amp;c. The fourth day from the beginning of the fit his breath was much oppre&s;&s;ed, his knees, legs, and feet va&s;tly &s;welled, and &s;o much di&s;co|loured, that it was apprehended, by a gentle|man of the faculty who &s;aw him in the afternoon, that a mortification would come on before the next morning. In the evening he became delirious at times; in one of the intervals of &s;en&s;e he &s;ent for me; I did for him what I thought proper; in a few hours afterwards his pains became ea&s;ier; he pa&s;&s;ed a good night; the next morning the &s;wel|ling of the knees, legs, and feet, was great|ly abated, and they had regained their natural colour; he felt no pain, except a very little in an old &s;car on one knee, was lively and full of &s;pirits, without thir&s;t, and had a good appetite: in 10 days more he was perfectly well, a tenderne&s;s only remaining in his feet for &s;ome days longer. He has had lately a &s;light attack, that was too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve notice, going off in a day or two of it&s;elf; and when I left him in New York la&s;t January he was hearty and &s;trong.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="26">
<P>Mrs. ZURACHER, aged 32, having taken cold in lying-in, was &s;eized with pains in all her joints, that fixed at la&s;t in her left knee, which &s;welled greatly, and became exce&s;&s;ive hard and painful. It had been in this &s;itu|ation between two and three months when I was called, and was daily growing wor&s;e in &s;pite of the internal and external medi|cines &s;he u&s;ed: but in a week after &s;he was able to walk about, and at the end of the fortnight was quite well.</P>
<P>Mr. TROOP, Merchant. This gentleman, between 40 and 50 years of age, had been confined to his chamber in the winter for above &s;ix weeks, with a violent Rheumati&s;m affecting mo&s;t of his limbs. In the &s;um|mer following he came to town and caught cold, which brought on a return of his di&s;|order: the pain affected every limb, and al|mo&s;t every joint: his &s;ervants were obliged to put him to bed and take him up, being unable to help him&s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding the advantage of the &s;ea&s;on, he apprehended, from the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, that it would continue &s;ome weeks. When I &s;aw him he had been ill but two or three days. I gave him &s;ome medicines in the evening, the next morning his pains were gone, the limbs were &s;upple and ea&s;y, he got up with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in the afternoon went, in
<PB N="25" REF="27">a carriage, a dozen miles to his country &s;eat, and I never heard that he had the lea&s;t re|turn of it, though it is now above four years ago.</P>
<P>I in&s;ert the following ca&s;e becau&s;e I think it &s;ingular; and as I have mentioned the Indian Anti&s;pa&s;modic root, I &s;hall add an in&s;tance or two of its effects.</P>
<P>JOHN ABEL, about 40 years of age. This man had been &s;ubject to the Epilep&s;y or Falling-Sickne&s;s for many years: the fits had latterly become more frequent than before: in&s;tead of attacking him once in ten days or a fortnight, they came on almo&s;t every day, and &s;ometimes he had two or three fits in a day. The mo&s;t remarkable thing in this ca&s;e, and for which I relate it, was a &s;en&s;a|tion of inten&s;e coldne&s;s he complained of in his &s;tomach: he de&s;cribed it to be like a piece in his &s;tomach of the &s;ize of a dollar or greater, that was like &s;o much ice. He took many things to warm his &s;tomach, but the &s;tronge&s;t &s;pirits and the warme&s;t medi|cines he could &s;wallow gave him no relief. He had taken bark, Valerian, Steel, and other things, without benefit. Within a week from the time I began with him he got rid of the coldne&s;s in his &s;tomach, and his fits &s;topt. I went on giving him medicines, and the fits did not return for three months; and
<PB N="26" REF="28">in all probability he would have been com|pletely cured, if he had not thought him&s;elf well, and upon the &s;trength of that laid a|&s;ide all re&s;traint, and made too free with his con&s;titution. The di&s;order then returned and gradually became wor&s;e; but before it had got to the former height he applied to a foreign practitioner, and died, as I was in|formed, of an apoplexy.</P>
<P>Mrs. B. a gentlewoman about 40 years old, had a numbne&s;s in one leg; had been long troubled with Drop&s;ical &s;wellings of the legs, and afflicted with various nervous complaints to a terrible degree. I gave her an infu&s;ion of the root I mentioned before; it promoted the di&s;charge by urine, expelled va&s;t quantities of wind, procured a good ap|petite, &s;weet refre&s;hing &s;leep, and re&s;tored her to perfect health as a per&s;on now in Lon|don can te&s;tify.</P>
<P>Mrs. PELHAM, about forty years old, for a dozen years, and more, was afflicted with many nervous complaints, and many di&s;|orders in con&s;equence of them: wind and &s;wellings of the &s;tomach and bowels, indi|ge&s;tion, co&s;tivene&s;s, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, pains in the head, giddine&s;s, univer&s;al languor and debility, pains in the brea&s;t, ob&s;tructions in the monthly evacuations, little urine, ri&s;ing in the throat, cough, &s;welled legs, &amp;c. In
<PB N="27" REF="29">this long cour&s;e of years &s;he tried many doc|tors, and many medicines, that were recom|mended to her; but nothing gave her any more than momentary relief, except the In|dian root; which, in a few weeks, removed all her complaints, and re&s;tored her to perfect health and &s;trength.</P>
<P>I could relate many in&s;tances of per&s;ons who were re&s;cued from de&s;truction by the&s;e medicines, when the Gout, after de&s;troying the joints, and going through the tragical &s;cene de&s;cribed by Sydenham, had, at la&s;t, brought on mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms, by invading the noble parts, as the head, &s;to|mach, bowels, lungs, &amp;c. The foregoing hi&s;tories, however, &s;ufficiently prove their great efficacy in the mo&s;t &s;tubborn ca&s;es; and therefore, in&s;tead of &s;welling this little tract with &s;uperfluous in&s;tances of the like nature, I &s;hall throw together a few loo&s;e ob&s;ervations that may be of real u&s;e.</P>
<P>The Gout, it is well known, oftentimes puts on the appearance of other di&s;ea&s;es: many &s;uch ca&s;es I have cured. In &s;ome in|&s;tances I tried the&s;e medicines without any &s;u&s;picion of the Gout being the cau&s;e of the di&s;order, or for any other rea&s;on than be|cau&s;e the medicines were &s;afe, and every thing el&s;e had been tried in vain; and I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee my patients get rid of their old complaints upon falling into a fit of the Gout. I have known this happen
<PB N="28" REF="30">to &s;everal people who had been long afflicted with nervous and &s;corbutic di&s;ea&s;es, as they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be; &s;uch as giddine&s;s, dim|ne&s;s of &s;ight, noi&s;e in the ears, pains and &s;tiffne&s;s in the head and in the eyes, a&s;thmas, pains in the brea&s;t, con&s;umptions, pal&s;ies, pains in the loins mi&s;taken for gravel or &s;tone, oppre&s;&s;ion and lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, fluxes, ob&s;tructions in the liver, certain female com|plaints, &amp;c. all which aro&s;e from a Gouty cau&s;e, as the effects of the medicines, and the recovery of the patients, proved.</P>
<P>In the treatment of Gouty per&s;ons I do not confine my&s;elf to my own remedies: I take all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I can from the me|dicines in common u&s;e; and, for that rea&s;on, I generally mix other medicines with my own, to a&s;&s;i&s;t or determine their operation and effects, as I think be&s;t, according to the con&s;titution of the per&s;on, and the nature and &s;eat of the di&s;order in different patients: I al&s;o vary the method of proceeding as to bleeding, vomiting, &s;weating, purging, &amp;c. in different ca&s;es, in the management and re|gular application of which particulars I re|ceived con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance and inform|ation, while I was in America, from Sir James Jay, to whom I communicated my di&s;coveries and improvements, in return for his candid behaviour to me. And &s;ince I have mentioned that gentleman's name, I mu&s;t take the liberty to add, that he &s;aw &s;e|veral
<PB N="29" REF="31">of the patients who&s;e ca&s;es are related in this tract, and attended &s;ome of them, at the reque&s;t of the per&s;ons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the treatment of them.</P>
<P>I do not a&s;&s;ert it as a fact, but I am in|clined to think that the&s;e medicines, after carrying off the Gouty matter that occa&s;ions the pre&s;ent fit, prevent the return of the di&s;order by rectifying tho&s;e particular &s;e|cretions and excretions which are naturally de&s;tined to di&s;charge tho&s;e morbid particles that, when they are retained in the body, and collected in &s;ufficient quantity, bring on the fit: and what particularly makes me think &s;o is, that many people who are liable to the Gout feel &s;light pains whenever the per&s;pi|ration in the feet is ob&s;tructed; that many people who have been troubled for years to|gether with con&s;tant heat, drine&s;s, and fre|quent &s;harp pains in the feet, were perfectly cured when their feet were brought to per|&s;pire freely and naturally by the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines: and further, as far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, tho&s;e per&s;ons are mo&s;t &s;everely afflicted with the Gout who have the lea&s;t per&s;piration in the feet.</P>
<P>The affinity between the nature of the Gout and Stone is well known; but I don't know that any one has taken notice that there is an affinity al&s;o in their cure. It has indeed, I think, been thought that &s;ome things which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have given
<PB N="30" REF="32">relief in the Gout, increa&s;ed the calculous complaints the patients were troubled with. If this be true, it amounts to no more than what I have &s;aid before, that tho&s;e Gout medicines did not cure, but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the di&s;order, and in&s;tead of expelling the Gouty matter, only diverted the natural cour&s;e of it. But I have had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome patients of mine, who were af|flicted with both the&s;e cruel di&s;ea&s;es, have met with relief for the Stone while I was treating them for the Gout alone. I &s;hall &s;ay no more of the Stone at pre&s;ent, but de|fer the account of the experiments I made with various &s;olvents, and of their effects on the body, till another opportunity.</P>
<P>I &s;elected the preceding ca&s;es for publi|lication becau&s;e they are all of long &s;tanding, and therefore the fitte&s;t to determine the merit of my di&s;coveries and improvements; mo&s;t of them happened above five years, none le&s;s than four years ago. In&s;tances of a later date would be inconclu&s;ive; we could not depend on the continuance of the good ef|fects of the medicines, nor could we be cer|tain that bad con&s;equences would not en&s;ue: but in the&s;e ca&s;es both tho&s;e points are &s;uffi|ciently determined. The&s;e ca&s;es are &s;ome of the mo&s;t favourable, as well as unfavour|able, that occurred. I could relate &s;ome others of a more &s;triking nature, which I &s;uppre&s;s, that I might not give unea&s;ine&s;s, or
<PB N="31" REF="33">&s;eem to reflect on any per&s;on. I hope the public will excu&s;e the inaccuracies of &s;tile, &amp;c. in this little performance, for I have be&s;towed more time and pains in &s;earching into the works of nature, the powers of na|tural bodies, the productions of chemi&s;try, and their effects on the human frame in va|rious di&s;ea&s;es, than in &s;tudying the beauties of language.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Captain BAYARD, who&s;e ca&s;e has been related, may be &s;een at the NEW YORK Coffee-Hou&s;e in Sweetings-Alley, Cornhill, every day, about Change hours.</P>
