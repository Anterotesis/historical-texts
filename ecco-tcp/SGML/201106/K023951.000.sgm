<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE APOTHECARIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent the Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from Ignorance, or Temerity in the <HI>Admini|&s;tration</HI> of Medicines, King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIth, by his Charter e&s;tabli&s;hed the COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, <HI>excluding</HI> all Per&s;ons, who &s;hould not be li&s;enced by them, from the Practice of Phy&s;ick within <HI>London,</HI> and &s;even Miles thereof: Which Charter was &s;oon afterwards confirmed by <HI>Parliament,</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> from Practice extended all over <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And to prevent the like Mi&s;chiefs in the <HI>Preparation</HI> of Medicines, the &s;aid Col|lege were by &s;ub&s;equent Acts directed to elect, yearly, <HI>Four</HI> of their Fellows, who, after taking an Oath of Office, were impowered (with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Wardens of the Company of Grocers and Apothecaries) to vi&s;it all Apothecaries Hou&s;es within <HI>London</HI> only, and to de&s;troy &s;uch Drugs and Medicines as they &s;hould find defective; which Power of <HI>Vi&s;itation</HI> was afterwards, by a Charter of King <HI>James</HI> the I&s;t, ex|tended to the Di&s;tance of <HI>&s;even</HI> Miles round <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Exerci&s;e of this la&s;t Power being limitted to four Per&s;ons, the &s;ame ap|peared to <HI>Sir Theodore De Mayerne,</HI> and <HI>Henry Atkins,</HI> Phy&s;icians to King <HI>James</HI> the I&s;t (and who, being the then <HI>mo&s;t illu&s;trious</HI> Members of the College, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to declare the Sen&s;e of the whole Body) &s;o very in&s;ufficient for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the variety of Abu&s;es intended to be remedied, that at <HI>their</HI> De&s;ire, and for the <HI>more effectually</HI> preventing tho&s;e Abu&s;es, the &s;aid King very &s;oon after, by another Charter, formed the Apothecaries of <HI>London</HI> into a di&s;tinct Society, with the like Powers of Vi&s;itation, and expre&s;sly <HI>prohibited</HI> all Per&s;ons from exerci&s;ing the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Apothecary with|in &s;even Miles of <HI>London,</HI> unle&s;s fir&s;t examined, approved, and licen&s;ed by the &s;aid <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE it is that the <HI>Validity</HI> of the &s;aid Charter being doubtful, and the <HI>Extent</HI> of the Powers thereby granted uncertain, and there being no Provi&s;ion for rectifying any <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e Powers, the &s;aid <HI>Society</HI> have ever been very cautious in the Exerci&s;e thereof, and of late Years e&s;pecially, have kept up the <HI>Form</HI> only of a <HI>Vi&s;itation:</HI> Whence it has happened, that &s;everal ignorant, and illiterate Per&s;ons have been encouraged to en|ter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Apothecary, whil&s;t others, of perhaps a more regular <HI>Edu|cation,</HI> and better <HI>Knowledge,</HI> have in order to engro&s;s the Trade, by under-&s;elling the fair Apothecary, ventured to compound their Medicines of damaged, &s;tale, and coun|terfeit Ingredients; &s;o that upon the whole, great Quantities of pernicious Medicines have been &s;old in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London,</HI> and tran&s;mitted into all Parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>THESE Practices being notorious, the College in 1722, procured the Act of Parlia|ment (now propo&s;ed to be revived) to e&s;tabli&s;h their Power of Vi&s;itation agreeable to their Charter. But a Clau&s;e having, upon their Attempt to obtain a Bill for reviving the &s;aid Act in 1729, been added by a Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons [for granting an Appeal from the Judgment of the Cen&s;ors to &s;ix Phy&s;icians and &s;ix Apo|thecaries to be determined upon Oath, and in Ca&s;e of Equality of Voices, by the Opi|nion of the Pre&s;ident or Vice-Pre&s;ident of the College] the &s;aid Bill was drop'd, and the College have not &s;ince thought proper to apply for any Bill of that kind, notwith|&s;tanding the Continuance and daily Increa&s;e of the bad Practices above-mentioned.</P>
<P>AT length &s;everal Apothecaries, [who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion affords them but too frequent Op|portunities of ob&s;erving the Extent and mi&s;chievous Effects of tho&s;e bad Practices,] thought it their Duty, as well in Regard to the <HI>Publick,</HI> as them&s;elves, to repre&s;ent the &s;ame to the LEGISLATURE.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>IN Con&s;equence of this Application, the Hou&s;e of Commons have been plea&s;ed to order in a Bill, to revive, <HI>explain, and amend</HI> the &s;aid Act pa&s;&s;ed in 1722. From which Order the &s;aid Petitioners conceive that honourable Hou&s;e was &s;atisfied of the <HI>In&s;uffici|ency</HI> of a mere <HI>Revival</HI> of the &s;aid Act, and therefore they &s;ubmit the following <HI>Amendments</HI> or <HI>Alterations,</HI> as what they humbly apprehend will render the &s;aid Act <HI>mo&s;t effectual</HI> on the one Hand, and prevent any <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of the Powers thereby granted on the other, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> &s;hall yearly elect ten &s;uffici|ently &s;killful Per&s;ons to be called <HI>Examiners of Apothecaries,</HI> and forty-eight (or any other competent Number) to be called <HI>Examiners of Medicines,</HI> who &s;hall all be <HI>&s;worn</HI> to the due Execution of their re&s;pective Offices.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT for the Future no Per&s;on (except the pre&s;ent Members of the Society, who have been already examined) &s;hall, within &s;even Miles of <HI>London,</HI> exerci&s;e the Art of an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> unle&s;s fir&s;t examined, and approved by three, or more of the &s;aid <HI>Examiners of Apothecaries,</HI> and licen&s;ed to exerci&s;e the &s;ame by Let|ters Te&s;timonial, under the Seal of the &s;aid <HI>Society.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THAT any Per&s;on rejected by the &s;aid <HI>Examiners</HI> may have an Appeal to the Pre&s;ident, and Cen&s;ors of the <HI>College,</HI> and if approved by them, &s;hall be licenced by the &s;aid <HI>Society.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. THAT there &s;hall be paid to the &s;aid <HI>Society</HI> for every Examination and Li|cence <GAP DESC="blank"> and no more; and that every &s;uch licen&s;ed Per&s;on &s;hall, during his Continuance in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, pay (as the Freemen of the &s;aid Society do) the yearly Sum of &s;ix Shillings, to be <HI>appropriated</HI> to the &s;upporting the <HI>Botannical</HI> Garden at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> to which he, and his Apprentices &s;hall have Liberty to re&s;ort, for their In&s;truction in <HI>Botany.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>V. THAT (in lieu of the &s;aid Cen&s;ors) the &s;aid <HI>Examiners of Medicines,</HI> or any four of them, &s;hall have Power, when&s;oever they &s;hall think fit (and be obliged, as often as the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;hall think proper) to go upon the Vi|&s;itation, and thereupon to enter any Hou&s;e <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of any Per&s;on within the Limits afore&s;aid, who &s;hall prepare, or keep for Sale, any <HI>compound Medicines,</HI> and to examine the &s;ame, and <HI>de&s;troy</HI> &s;uch as they &s;hall adjudge bad.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. THAT any Per&s;on &s;hall have Liberty to appeal from the Judgment of the &s;aid <HI>Examiners,</HI> to the &s;aid <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> or <HI>Vice-Pre&s;ident,</HI> and <HI>Cen&s;ors,</HI> who&s;e Deter|mination &s;hall be <HI>final,</HI> the Medicine complained of to be, in the mean Time, conveyed to the <HI>College.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. THAT in all Ca&s;es of Appeal the &s;aid <HI>Examiners,</HI> as well as the Parties <HI>ap|pellant,</HI> may produce Witne&s;&s;es to be examined upon <HI>Oath,</HI> either as to their Knowledge, or Opinion of the Preparation in que&s;tion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. THAT every Per&s;on convicted by the &s;aid <HI>Examiners</HI> (unle&s;s their Judgment is rever&s;ed within <GAP DESC="blank">) of &s;elling or keeping for Sale, any <HI>adulterated</HI> or <HI>per|nicious</HI> Medicine &s;hall forfeit the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank"></ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. THAT Per&s;ons ob&s;tructing the &s;aid <HI>Examiners</HI> in the Execution of their Office &s;hall forfeit the Sum of <GAP DESC="blank"></ITEM>
<ITEM>X. THAT all Penalties &s;hall go, one half to <HI>any Per&s;on</HI> who will &s;ue for the &s;ame, and the other half to the <HI>Poor</HI> of the Pari&s;h where the Offender &s;hall re&s;ide.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THESE <HI>Amendments,</HI> the Petitioners humbly conceive, will appear to be proper, and <HI>nece&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ary,</HI> for the following Rea&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the four <HI>Cen&s;or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> who mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be, as the Law requires, the <HI>be&s;t learned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;t, and mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently mo&s;t employed,) cannot &s;pare &s;ufficient <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> to attend the Vi&s;itation, &s;o diligently, and <HI>frequently</HI> as they ought, without great Lo&s;s to them&s;elves, and to the <HI>Publick,</HI> who may want their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in another Way.</P>
<P>THAT their <HI>Number,</HI> even if they were to give their <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> Attention, and dedicate their <HI>whole</HI> Time to this Duty, would not be &s;ufficient to vi&s;it <HI>all</HI> Apothecaries Shops within <HI>London,</HI> and &s;even Miles thereof, which upon a fair Computation, will appear to be upwards of a Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THAT the original Juri&s;diction, and the Determination on the Appeal ought not to be in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Body, the Members of which may be &s;uppo&s;ed tender of each other's Re|putation, and the general Character of their <HI>Community.</HI></P>
<P>THAT neither the <HI>Cen&s;ors</HI> in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> In&s;tance, nor the <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> and <HI>Fellows</HI> upon the <HI>Appeal,</HI> are by the &s;aid Act put under the Re&s;triction of any particular <HI>Oath.</HI></P>
<P>THAT by the &s;aid Act no Provi&s;ion is made for preventing Per&s;ons from entering upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Pharmacy</HI> who have not been properly in&s;tructed therein, and
<PB N="3" REF="3">who con&s;equently require a much &s;tricter and more frequent Vi&s;itation than any <HI>rea&s;on|able</HI> Number of Vi&s;itors can po&s;&s;ibly attend.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>only</HI> Puni&s;hment provided by the &s;aid Act for keeping any adulterated, or pernicious Medicine for Sale, is the <HI>de&s;troying</HI> it, which in mo&s;t In&s;tances (as Med|icines are principally adulterated for the &s;ake of &s;aving the <HI>expen&s;ive</HI> Ingredients) is a very <HI>trifling</HI> Puni&s;hment, by no Means adequate to the <HI>Offence.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Alterations</HI> in the Act (it is humbly conceived) will an&s;wer all the &s;alutary Intentions of the honourable <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> and yet pre&s;erve to the Society of <HI>Apo|thecaries,</HI> the Privileges granted to them by their <HI>Charter; Privileges!</HI> &s;o far from be|ing unrea&s;onable in their own Nature, that <HI>Parliament</HI> has thought proper to grant, or confirm the like to the <HI>College</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> and Company of <HI>Surgeons;</HI> and that, with|out any of tho&s;e <HI>Guards</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of Power, which the Petitioners propo&s;e, and de&s;ire may be provided in <HI>their</HI> Ca&s;e; nor can the &s;aid <HI>College,</HI> and <HI>Company</HI> but ap|prove, in the Society of <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> a Con&s;titution which, in their <HI>own</HI> re&s;pective Bo|dies, they have, by long Experience, found to be highly beneficial to the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the <HI>College,</HI> it is true the Power of <HI>Vi&s;itation,</HI> which has hitherto been exerci&s;ed by their <HI>Cen&s;ors,</HI> and the Wardens of the Society of <HI>Apothecaries</HI> in <HI>Conjunction,</HI> is by the&s;e <HI>Alterations</HI> propo&s;ed to be wholly ve&s;ted in &s;worn Examiners of the &s;aid <HI>Society.</HI> But then in lieu thereof, the &s;aid College are intended to be ve&s;ted with a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Juri&s;diction, and Controul, which the Petitioners humbly conceive is more &s;uitable, not only to the Convenience, but Dignity of that learned <HI>Body;</HI> and from the above-mentioned Te&s;timony of <HI>Sir Theodore de Mayerne</HI> and <HI>Dr. Atkins,</HI> as well as from the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf, it appears that the Apothecaries are very properly qualified for the <HI>Vi&s;itation</HI> hereby propo&s;ed to be entru&s;ted with them.</P>
<P>As to the Per&s;ons who will be immediately affected by the <HI>Examination</HI> intended by the&s;e Amendments,&mdash;It is &s;ubmitted whether it can be thought an <HI>Hard&s;hip</HI> to oblige tho&s;e who will engage in a Profe&s;&s;ion, of &s;o much Con&s;equence to the Publick, to give a Te&s;t of their Ability and Fitne&s;s for it; and as they will become intituled to &s;e|veral of the <HI>Privileges,</HI> without being &s;ubject to the many burthen&s;ome and expen|&s;ive <HI>Offices</HI> of the &s;aid Society, it is but rea&s;onable that they &s;hould contribute <HI>&s;omething</HI> towards defraying the <HI>additional</HI> Expences which the&s;e new Duties will occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Application of the yearly Sum of &s;ix Shillings (it is likewi&s;e hoped) will be thought &s;o very u&s;eful to the <HI>Publick,</HI> that no Objection can be made to &s;o <HI>trifling</HI> a Demand.</P>
<P>THE &s;aid <HI>Society</HI> do (at an Expence too great for their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances) endeavour to maintain a Botanical Garden, which the Munificence of that great Patron of na|tural and u&s;eful Knowledge, <HI>Sir Hans Sloane,</HI> has enabled them to e&s;tabli&s;h: A Matter in &s;everal <HI>foreign</HI> Cities, thought worthy of the <HI>Publick</HI> Care. At this Garden, (at pre|&s;ent furni&s;hed with as great a Number of <HI>Plants</HI> as perhaps any in <HI>Europe</HI>) a De|mon&s;trator is appointed by the <HI>Society,</HI> to in&s;truct their Members, and Pupils in this ne|ce&s;&s;ary Branch of <HI>Pharmacy,</HI> and to &s;uperintend, at proper Times, <HI>Herborizations</HI> in the Neighbourhood of <HI>London;</HI> of all which Advantages the &s;aid <HI>Licentiates</HI> and their Apprentices will be entitled to partake.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the <HI>Petitioners</HI> humbly hope the Publick will, by the&s;e Propo&s;als, be &s;atisfied that they have no <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> Views of enriching the <HI>Society,</HI> of which they are Members, or of procuring any particular Advantage to <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> their &s;ole <HI>Intention,</HI> in offering to take this <HI>Burthen</HI> upon them, being that they may contribute as much as in them lies to the preventing <HI>Frauds</HI> in their Profe&s;&s;ion. And as a Proof that they have no <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> Views, they decline no <HI>Appeal</HI> to any Juri&s;diction the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> &s;hall think proper, not de&s;iring to be tru&s;ted with a Power over <HI>others,</HI> which they would be &s;orry to &s;ee granted to any, over <HI>them&s;elves:</HI> neither do they wi&s;h for more than a temporary <HI>Probation</HI> of their Scheme, that &s;o, if it &s;hall be found <HI>hurtful</HI> or ineffectual, it may not be intailed upon <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
