<P>CONSIDERING the partiality that is entertained for novels in this country, it is much to be regretted that the generality of them are not written in a &s;tyle and man|ner &s;ufficiently excellent to ju&s;tify &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a prejudice in their fa|vour; &mdash; on the contrary, in very many in&s;tances, we find the charac|ters
<PB N="x" REF="7">
are unnatural, the plot impro|bable, and the language flim&s;y and unmeaning. Be&s;ides, it is too often objected, by the thinking part of the world, that their tendency ope|rates rather to corrupt the heart than to amend it, as the writers endeavour to throw a &s;ort of plea|&s;ing and fa&s;hionable veil over the blandi&s;hments of vice, and make the habits of intrigue familiar to the minds of the female part of the ri&s;ing generation, before they can form a proper di&s;tinction between right and wrong, which is doing a greater injury to public morality

than is at fir&s;t apprehended; where|as, if the &s;cenes were drawn from real life, the reader may not only be entertained with the ab&s;urdities of the weak part of human nature, but at the &s;ame time gather expe|rience from the ill con&s;equences of their folly. But this is a &s;pecies of writing either very little under|&s;tood, or very difficult to be ac|compli&s;hed; for, &s;carce one in a hundred, of all the ladies and gen|tlemen who have favoured the world with what they call <HI>novels,</HI> have been able to effect it; and we are &s;till left to lament, that the genius of a <HI>Fielding,</HI> a <HI>Smollett,</HI> or a <HI>Gold|&s;mith,</HI>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>My origin and introduction into &s;ociety.&mdash; A &s;hort account of my family.&mdash;My fa|ther's retirement.&mdash;His court&s;hip of my mother.&mdash;Their marriage.&mdash;My birth. &mdash;The dreadful circum&s;tance that ac|companied it.&mdash;My mother's &s;ickne&s;s and recovery.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;ome curio&s;ity may be excited in the minds of tho&s;e who &s;hall peru&s;e the following narrative re&s;pect|ing
<PB N="2" REF="11">
the place of my nativity, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give a brief de|tail of that as well as &s;ome other mat|ters that re&s;pect my fir&s;t entrance upon this great theatre, the world. I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that a &s;pirit of vanity by no means impels me to become my own biographer, as is frequently the ca&s;e with certain great men, who (to u&s;e a pertinent expre&s;&s;ion from the facetious Harry Fielding upon a &s;imilar occa|&s;ion) have been &s;u&s;pected to have lived an eccentric life, merely to have the plea&s;ure of telling it to the world; no, I di&s;claim &s;uch an idea <HI>in toto;</HI> my mo|tive is a &s;incere de&s;ire to oblige my readers of all parties and complexions; which they will readily give credit to, when they under&s;tand that the authors of my being were not remarkable for
<PB N="3" REF="12">
valuing them&s;elves upon the honour of their hou&s;e or the &s;plendour of their &s;i|tuations.</P>
<P>I drew my fir&s;t breath in Ireland, a country long &s;ince renowned for the ho&s;pitality and generous &s;pirit of its in|habitants. The &s;pot where I fir&s;t open|ed my eyes upon the genial day was at a &s;mall cabin, on the borders of the famous bay of Allen, in the Queen's county. My father had &s;erved, with great credit to his country and honour to him&s;elf, in a regiment of hor&s;e at the celebrated battle of Minden, where he received a wound that incapacitated him from continuing in the army any long|er. With the heart of a hero, and the re&s;ignation of a philo&s;opher, he was found to quit a &s;ervice, to which the habits of his life and a natural love for
<PB N="4" REF="13">
glory had attached him in a particular manner; the recollection, that he had been an active, though humble, in&s;tru|ment in the abovementioned gallant ac|tion, proved a &s;ource of happine&s;s that cheered him to his grave.</P>
<P>Fatigued with the calamities of war, he pined to re-vi&s;it his native home, from which he had been &s;eparated five years;&mdash;a &s;mall portion of time perhaps to tho&s;e who&s;e hearts were never &s;acri|ficed to love and con&s;tancy; but it was not &s;o with my father, for five years to him appeared as five thou&s;and.</P>
<P>There lived, in the neighbourhood of my grandfather, a rich farmer, who at that time rented two hundred acres from the lord of the manor. By a cour&s;e of frugality and indu&s;try he had ama&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient wealth to command the nece&s;|&s;aries,
<PB N="5" REF="14">
and even the comforts, of life; but his riches did not con&s;i&s;t in his mo|ney &s;o much as in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an only daughter, whom he tenderly loved, and expected to marry with advantage to a farmer's &s;on, of the next village, of exten&s;ive property.</P>
<P>The fair Kathleen was the admiration of all the young men in that part of the country; but &s;he treated their offers of marriage with &s;corn and neglect, which was univer&s;ally attributed to her pride, though the real motive was a &s;ecret pa&s;|&s;ion &s;he entertained for my father. In the cour&s;e of their rural occupations they frequently met; &mdash; a &s;ympathy of &s;oul rendered them plea&s;ing to each other; &mdash; they looked, and frequently gave involuntary &s;ighs, the meaning of which they could not comprehend;&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="15">
they &s;ought every opportunity of view|ing each other, but it produced no other effect than riveting their chains the &s;tronger. At la&s;t, nature, tired with the conflict, urged my father to a declara|tion of his pa&s;&s;ion; he &s;eized the trem|bling hand of his dear Kathleen, and, pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, ki&s;&s;ed it with an ardour that alarmed the natural mode&s;ty of his mi&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;the blood ru&s;hed into her cheeks, and, ha&s;tily withdrawing her hand, &s;he reproved his warmth with an air of tenderne&s;s that tacitly encouraged the freedoms which her language affect|ed to depre&s;s.</P>
<P>By repeated &s;olicitations my father won her to declare that &s;he would mar|ry only him; but, prudence forbidding their union at that time, they re&s;olved to defer the completion of their bli&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="16">
till a change of circum&s;tances &s;hould happen in their favour. Their inter|views now became more frequent than ever, till their mutual pa&s;&s;ion at la&s;t reached the ears of her father, who, en|raged, in the mo&s;t peremptory terms of anger forbade his daughter ever to think more of her lover, whom he re|pre&s;ented as utterly beneath her con&s;i|deration or regard.</P>
<P>It was not long before my father learned the dreadful i&s;&s;ue of their af|fections. In the fir&s;t moments of his de&s;pair he determined to put an end to an exi&s;tence, which was now rendered mi&s;erable for ever: he actually was pre|paring for that dreadful mea&s;ure, when a ray of hope diverted him from the horrid purpo&s;e; his fainting &s;pirits once more revived, and he re&s;olved, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="8" REF="17">
to &s;ee his Kathleen once again. Cupid, ever attentive to the intere&s;ts of his votaries, favoured his re&s;olution; for, by means of a hind in the &s;ervice of her father, he got a me&s;&s;age conveyed to the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart, earne&s;tly in|treating a meeting in the evening. She complied with his wi&s;hes, when my fa|ther, with tears in his eyes, took a fi|nal adieu; re&s;olving, that the violence of his love &s;hould be no bar to the fu|ture happine&s;s of his adored Kathleen.</P>
<P>After a &s;olemn and &s;incere inter|change of tho&s;e &s;entiments which love in&s;pires, they parted, with their eyes bathed in tears. My father, to forget his &s;orrows, repaired to a public hou&s;e in an adjoining village, where, meeting with a recruiting-&s;erjeant, who, &s;truck with the manly beauty of his figure,
<PB N="9" REF="18">
made him a tender of his &s;ervices, and courted him to join a regiment, then &s;tationed in that county. Urged by de&s;pair, and willing to die, he accepted his propo&s;al, joined the corps, and went abroad, where he was &s;oon &s;ignalized for his bravery and good conduct. On the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the peace he re|turned home, when, upon inquiring after his dear Kathleen, he learned that &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted every importunity of her father to marry, who, dying &s;hortly after, in con&s;equence of her di&s;obe|dience left her de&s;titute of a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>My father &s;oon di&s;covered the place of her retreat, and, flying on the wings of love, he re&s;cued her from that mi|&s;ery to which &s;he was re&s;igned, from an apprehen&s;ion that her lover was no more. The joy that followed upon their meet|ing
<PB N="10" REF="19">
can be conceived better than de&s;cri|bed;&mdash;to be brief, they were married in a few days, and lived together many years afterwards, exemplary objects of mutual love and fidelity.</P>
<P>Two moons had &s;carce wa&s;ted, &s;ince Hymen &s;miled upon their wi&s;hes, when my mother exhibited evident &s;igns of pregnancy: every care was taken by my father, every con&s;olation admini&s;tered, that could reduce the pains of her &s;itua|tion; he viewed the progre&s;s of her &s;tate with joy, anxiou&s;ly looking forward to the time that heaven &s;hould vouch&s;afe to give them an offspring, equally dear to both.</P>
<P>My mother had advanced into the eighth month of her pregnancy, when my father, labouring one evening in his potatoe-garden, was alarmed with
<PB N="11" REF="20">
the cries of a female. He immedi|ately ru&s;hed, as it were by in&s;tinct, to her relief; but who can paint the an|gui&s;h of his &s;oul, when, looking over the hedge, he perceived my mother pro|&s;trate on the road! he in&s;tantly rai&s;ed her up, and, inquiring into the cau&s;e of her affright, learned that a bull, dri|ven by &s;ome boys, ru&s;hed by her when &s;he was on the return from market, when her fears had overcome her &s;o far that &s;he &s;hrieked and fainted away.&mdash; Luckily the place of her accident was within a hundred yards of her own ca|bin, to which &s;he was conducted by my father with all po&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, who, placing her in a chair, began to rub her temples, and exerci&s;e all tho&s;e little a&s;|&s;iduities which are &s;o plea&s;ing to the human mind in the hour of &s;ickne&s;s or
<PB N="12" REF="21">
di&s;tre&s;s. But, notwith&s;tanding his ut|mo&s;t efforts, my mother grew &s;till wor&s;e; when, calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a female neighbour, &s;he pronounced &s;he was in labour. Upon this declaration &s;he was put to bed, and every a&s;&s;i&s;tance procured that the country could afford. Three quarters of an hour after the ar|rival of the midwife I was brought forth, and by her triumphantly di&s;played to my father as one of the fine&s;t male children that ever &s;he had the happine&s;s of introducing into this &s;curvy, motley, world of di&s;quiet and vici&s;&s;itudes. My father could not conceal his rapture at my infantine beauty and &s;hape, notwith|&s;tanding the moans and agony of my mother, who lay writhing under the pains with which heaven has thought
<PB N="13" REF="22">
proper to accompany the deare&s;t con|&s;equence of wedded love.</P>
<P>However, what with the tenderne&s;s of my father, and the admini&s;trations of the midwife, in about a fortnight the ro&s;y hue of health began to re-a&s;&s;ume her throne on the cheek of my mother; her vivacity returned, my father rejoi|ced, and every nece&s;&s;ary preparation was made to render the approaching chri&s;tening as &s;plendid and happy as the narrow circum&s;tances of my family would permit.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE time pre&s;cribed by cu&s;tom ha|ving arrived, when it was thought proper to give me a Chri&s;tian name, a &s;elect number of relations and friends were &s;ummoned to attend the ceremony. Among the re&s;t was an uncle of my fa|ther, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf, upon many occa&s;ions, in rendering him every &s;ervice that lay in his power; and, to
<PB N="15" REF="24">
manife&s;t his gratitude in the be&s;t man|ner he was able, my father re&s;olved that I &s;hould be named after him;&mdash;I was accordingly chri&s;tened ANTHONY, (that being the name of the old gentleman,) with all due rites and &s;olemn prepara|tions. It were needle&s;s to recount all the little plea&s;antries and harmle&s;s jokes which pa&s;&s;ed in that rural, though friend|ly, circle upon the occa&s;ion; good hu|mour pre&s;ided at the humble board, and gave a charming ze&s;t to the joyous en|tertainment. After each gue&s;t had drunk a health to young Anthony in whi&s;key-punch, the merry group &s;epa|rated, and &s;ought their re&s;pective homes, highly plea&s;ed with the conviviality of the evening.</P>
<P>When I had arrived at the age of five years it was determined by my fond pa|rents
<PB N="16" REF="25">
that I &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;chool, and an opportunity offered at that time which it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to em|brace.&mdash;The widow of an exci&s;e-officer, who had been left with a large family, in indigent circum&s;tances, was advi&s;ed by her friends to open a &s;chool, for the education of children at a certain age, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;upport of her young fa|mily. I was accordingly &s;ent to Mrs. Goodman, with a &s;trong charge from my father that &s;he would in&s;truct me in my letters with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, and an intreaty from my poor mother that &s;he would not whip me, for fear of &s;poiling my di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I attended the &s;chool regularly for three years, morning and afternoon, at the expiration of which I had made &s;uch a progre&s;s in my learning, that I was
<PB N="17" REF="26">
&s;poken of as a prodigy for my years;&mdash; I not only did great credit to the en|deavours of Mrs. Goodman, but gave infinite &s;atisfaction to my poor parents, under the idea that they had not be|&s;towed their money for nothing. This part of my education &s;tood them in half-a-crown a quarter;&mdash;an incon&s;iderable &s;um to the affluent and the vain, but a very important one to my father and mother, the former of whom laboured at hu&s;bandry for the poor pittance of &s;ixpence per day, and the latter &s;pun yarn for a much le&s;s con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>From this &s;chool I was removed to learn Latin and writing at a hedge aca|demy, kept for that purpo&s;e by a Ro|mi&s;h prie&s;t, who had been degraded for mal-practices in his profe&s;&s;ion by an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic &s;ynod of his own per&s;ua&s;ion.
<PB N="18" REF="27">
I had not been &s;ix months in my new &s;ituation, when, by the quickne&s;s of my parts and the cunning of my addre&s;s, I gained an entire a&s;cendency over the will of this country pedagogue, which was con&s;idered as a very flattering cir|cum&s;tance, as Father Doolough was not remarkable for the gentlene&s;s of his di&s;|po&s;ition or the charity of his opinion. However, the gratitude of my parents did not &s;uffer his partiality to their child to go unrewarded; every little oppor|tunity was &s;eized to &s;end his reverence a pre&s;ent of &s;ome fre&s;h butter, milk, and a piece of pork every Chri&s;tmas, when they killed a pig. It mu&s;t be owned, to the generality of my readers &s;uch acknowledgements will appear tri|fling; but the cheerfulne&s;s with which
<PB N="19" REF="28">
they were given was more than a com|pen&s;ation for their deficiency in value.</P>
<P>I made an a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s in my learning for my years, and could con|&s;true the ea&s;ie&s;t of the Latin authors with tolerable facility, when a dreadful accident happened, which proved, in its con&s;equences, a fatal wound to my pro&s;perity.&mdash;My father, returning home from a neighbouring fair, where he had been to purcha&s;e a cow, was thrown from his hor&s;e, and died upon the &s;pot. When the news was fir&s;t brought to my mother &s;he was deprived of her rea&s;on, and did not recover the u&s;e of her un|der&s;tanding until the remains of my much-lamented parent had been depo|&s;ited to &s;leep with his fathers:&mdash;from that moment &s;he gave her&s;elf up a prey to grief and lamentation; a rooted me|lancholy
<PB N="20" REF="29">
fa&s;tened on her mind, and, &s;e|cluding her&s;elf from comfort and &s;ociety, her con&s;titution was greatly impaired; the little property that their par&s;imony had gathered together was now dimi|ni&s;hing daily, her deare&s;t concerns were neglected, and even my pre&s;ence cea&s;ed to give her plea&s;ure. After langui&s;h|ing for a few months, the cold hand of death put a final period to all her mi&s;e|ries, and left me an orphan, at twelve years of age, to &s;truggle with a ba&s;e world in the be&s;t manner I was able.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the burial of my mother, a cou&s;in of her's, who entertained a &s;incere regard for her memory, and being a man not wholly unacquainted with the impul&s;e of humanity, under|took to put me in a &s;ituation that &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="31">
be mo&s;t likely ultimately to turn out to my advantage. After devi&s;ing various &s;chemes, it was &s;ettled between him and my &s;choolma&s;ter that I &s;hould remain in the hou&s;e of Father Doolough, and, by &s;erving him in the capacity of his boy, endeavour, by waiting upon his per&s;on, &s;weeping the &s;chool, and per|forming numberle&s;s other little offices, to repay him for the charges of victuals and education. I entered in this new department with more cheerfulne&s;s than could be expected from a child of my tender years, who had &s;o recently been deprived of parents, who&s;e only wi&s;h was to render him happy. But many days had not pa&s;&s;ed over my head be|fore I felt the lo&s;s of their protection and kindne&s;s. My ma&s;ter, being naturally of a moro&s;e and &s;aturnine di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="23" REF="32">
&s;eemed to &s;ingle me out as the object of his re&s;entment, when any accident or untoward circum&s;tance made him angry. One evening, when he returned home from a neighbouring village, I perceived his countenance, naturally &s;tern and forbidding, heightened with an unu&s;ual degree of &s;everity. He call|ed for me to take off his boots: I went, trembling with apprehen&s;ion, and had &s;carce laid hold of his foot, when he gave me a kick, which laid me &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor; at the &s;ame time loading me with the mo&s;t opprobrious epithets, calling me an aukward ra&s;cal, and that I was not worth be&s;towing bread and water upon. I made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to retreat from his fury and abu&s;e, and, hiding my&s;elf in the &s;chool-room, gave vent to a flood of tears, which in &s;ome
<PB N="24" REF="33">
mea&s;ure relieved my heart:&mdash;I con&s;i|dered that as the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on of all my future &s;orrow; I bewailed my condi|tion in terms of regret and de&s;pair; but, knowing of no remedy but pa|tience, I re&s;olved to bear up under my misfortunes in the be&s;t manner I was able. When I had indulged my&s;elf in the&s;e reveries for about half an hour, I was vi&s;ited by my ma&s;ter's niece, Judy, a good-natured girl, about five years older than my&s;elf, and who compa&s;|&s;ionated me from a &s;pirit of &s;ympathy, as her uncle, notwith&s;tanding the tie of con&s;anguinity, very frequently u&s;ed her in a manner to the full as cruel and un|ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>In this manner did I live for a whole twelvemonth, the humble, helple&s;s, vic|tim of an unfeeling barbarian, and pro|bably
<PB N="25" REF="34">
&s;hould have continued much longer, had not a circum&s;tance occur|red which determined me to change my &s;ituation at all events.&mdash;Unfortunately for me, &s;ome boys, belonging to our &s;chool, had broke into the fruit-garden of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, and not only &s;tripped the bu&s;hes of all the goo&s;eberries and currants they could meet, but committed various other wan|ton depredations, &s;uch as breaking the fences and de&s;troying the flowers. A formal complaint was lodged by the gentleman, who&s;e gardener &s;wore po&s;i|tively that he &s;aw a boy in the garden, and traced him as far as the &s;chool. The boys were all &s;everally examined, and, dreading the &s;choolma&s;ter's ven|geance, &s;toutly denied the fact. My ma&s;ter, thinking &s;ome expiation ab&s;o|lutely

nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e the gentle|man, and not being able to charge the theft home to any one, very charitably fixed upon me, who, he a&s;&s;erted, was the mo&s;t probable per&s;on in the &s;chool for an action of that enormity, from the wick|edne&s;s and bent of my di&s;po&s;ition.

<P>When I found my&s;elf pretty well re|covered from the hard puni&s;hment I had undergone, I took a firm and determi|ned re&s;olution to leave the hou&s;e for ever. I kept my purpo&s;e &s;ecret until the moment of putting it in execution, when I took the opportunity of the pe|dagogue's ab&s;ence from home to effect it.

<P><PB N="28" REF="37">After wandering for an hour through by-paths, and acro&s;s the mo&s;t unfre|quented fields, to avoid meeting my ma&s;ter, (the idea of whom was &s;hocking to my imagination,) I came to a little, mean-looking, cabin, which, by the well-known &s;ymbols, to Iri&s;h travellers, of a pipe and a rag &s;tuck in the thatch, I knew to be a hou&s;e of entertainment for weary wretches like my&s;elf, who, after travelling all day, &s;olace them|&s;elves with clean &s;traw in a corner, for the &s;mall con&s;ideration of two-pence per head.</P>
<P>As I approached nearer to this hum|ble man&s;ion of ho&s;pitality, I heard a noi&s;e, re&s;embling a confu&s;ion of voices, all engaged in conver&s;ation at the &s;ame time; and, above all, I could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the melodious tones of a
<PB N="29" REF="38">
bag-pipe. With &s;ome little apprehen|&s;ion I entered the cabin, and &s;oon learn|ed the cau&s;e of all this merriment, which was no other than a parcel of country people, who had a&s;&s;embled at this <HI>&s;hebeen</HI> hou&s;e, as they term it in Iri&s;h, to wake the body of the man's wife who lived there.&mdash;As this is a cu&s;|tom not known to the generality of my readers, I will give them an explana|tion.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on dies in Ireland, a|mong the lower orders of the people, it is u&s;ual for the neighbours to a&s;&s;em|ble, for a day or two previous to the interment of the body, at the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, who&s;e neare&s;t relations al|ways provide a &s;ufficient quantity of whi&s;key and tobacco for the accommo|dation of the gue&s;ts: and the&s;e meet|ings

are always mo&s;t numerous when the decea&s;ed has been particularly well-beloved; for the circum&s;tance of dy|ing, in that country, is not con&s;idered among the pea&s;antry as a matter of &s;or|row, but rejoicing; and this opinion is founded on the be&s;t idea imaginable, which is, that of the defunct's having been removed, by the will of heaven, from a &s;ituation laden with anxieties and trouble to a &s;tate of everla&s;ting joy;&mdash; and the poor cottager, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch principles, may look down with con|tempt on the affluence and vices of the great world.</P>
<P>After a few que&s;tions from the land|lord I was introduced among the fe&s;tive group, who, &s;itting on the ground, had formed a circle round the dead body, which was placed in a coffin, in the
<PB N="31" REF="40">
center of the apartment, elevated upon two &s;tools. In a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in the room there &s;at a little &s;quat man, with a loo&s;e great coat thrown carele&s;sly over his &s;houlders: he &s;eemed about fifty years of age, with a countenance remarkably carbuncled, and &s;o red and inflamed, that he looked at fir&s;t &s;ight like a flaming meteor: he had on a large bu&s;hy wig, without powder, a flapped hat, and boots, notwith&s;tanding which I could &s;ee plainly that his legs, when he &s;tood upright, formed a pa|renthe&s;is, or, in other words, were ex|tremely bandy. By the &s;ilence that was ob&s;erved, whenever the little man open|ed his mouth, I &s;oon found out that he was no other than the pari&s;h-prie&s;t, who had rode two miles on purpo&s;e to pay this mark of his re&s;pect to the memory
<PB N="32" REF="41">
of the decea&s;ed, for whom, I under|&s;tood, from the in&s;inuations of a part of the company, he had a particular degree of e&s;teem when living; &s;o much &s;o, that the foul voice of &s;candal was not wanting to a&s;&s;ert, that her godly confe&s;&s;or, in their hours of private de|votion, had a much greater regard for her body than her &s;oul; which opinion I the more readily gave credit to, as I perceived that the widower did not pay tho&s;e tokens of attention and profound re&s;pect to the prie&s;t as were rea&s;onably to be expected, and that he bore the lo&s;s of his wife with as much indiffe|rence and philo&s;ophy as if he had been educated in St. James's pari&s;h.</P>
<P>After the whi&s;key had circulated pret|ty bri&s;kly, I &s;aw the eyes of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tic begin to twinkle with &s;trong
<PB N="33" REF="42">
&s;ymptoms of intoxication; and the &s;trength of the liquor had &s;o far over-powered his under&s;tanding, that he vo|luntarily propo&s;ed giving the company a &s;ong; which being a&s;&s;ented to, with the lungs of a Stentor he bellowed forth the Wedding of Baltimore; and, being joined in chorus by the re&s;t, they made the room echo with a noi&s;e &s;o loud as mu&s;t have waked the decea&s;ed, if any thing le&s;s than the la&s;t trumpet could have rou&s;ed her from the &s;till-&s;leep of death.</P>
<P>When the noi&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the prie&s;t called for his hor&s;e, &s;ignifying his in|tention to depart; and, getting up, &s;tag|gered to the coffin, which leaning over, he uttered the following incoherent eja|culation:&mdash;"You know well enough, without my telling you, that you,&mdash;

<P><PB N="36" REF="45">After concluding this eloquent and pious harangue, the good man's powers of per&s;ua&s;ion for&s;ook him, and, falling fa&s;t a&s;leep over the dead body, he began to &s;nore louder than the ba&s;s note of a cathedral organ. The hu&s;band of the decea&s;ed, &s;lapping him on the &s;houlder, informed him that his hor&s;e was at the door, when he reeled out of the room with infinite difficulty, and, be&s;triding his garran, rode off towards his own home.</P>
<P>When the prie&s;t had left the room, who&s;e appearance, even drunk, kept them in &s;ome awe, they gave a loo&s;e to all tho&s;e indecent &s;ports, which they could not, with any propriety, act be|fore him. It was immediately deter|mined to hunt the brogue, a pa&s;time peculiar to that country. The mode is
<PB N="37" REF="46">
this:&mdash;one of the girls takes off her &s;hoe, which is there called a brogue, and the company, &s;itting with their knees bent, forms a pa&s;&s;age to convey the brogue from one per&s;on to another; for, in the quickne&s;s of the conveyance con&s;i&s;ts the merit of the game.</P>
<P>They had not pur&s;ued their diver&s;ion for above ten minutes when a very &s;e|rious affair took place. Darby, who had a va&s;t deal of roguery intermixed in the particles of his compo&s;ition, in &s;earching for the brogue under the legs of a young woman who &s;at next to him, made a terrible mi&s;take, which laid the foundation of much confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed;&mdash;in &s;hort, totally regardle&s;s of the &s;ugge&s;tions of delicacy, he laid his hand upon a part of the young lady, which gave her &s;uch offence, that, with
<PB N="38" REF="47">
one blow, &s;he laid him &s;prawling on his mother-earth. Her lover, who was one of the party, being made acquaint|ed with the nature of the tran&s;action, took the part of his <HI>enamorata,</HI> and aim|ed a blow at the head of the aggre&s;|&s;or, which unluckily alighting on the <HI>cranium</HI> of a drunken tithe-proctor, who was fa&s;t a&s;leep, he awaked in the utmo&s;t rage, and, demanding the name of the per&s;on who had pre&s;ented him with that friendly &s;alutation, he returned the compliment with &s;o much intere&s;t, that he made his a&s;&s;ailant &s;tag|ger under the blow, and fairly knocked him over an old woman, who, having taken too copious a quantity of whi&s;key that evening, was evacuating in a cor|ner the foul contents of an overcharged &s;tomach. The young woman, percei|ving
<PB N="39" REF="48">
the di&s;a&s;ter of her &s;weetheart, flew upon the proctor, with the fury of a lione&s;s in defence of her young, and, fa&s;tening her nails in his vi&s;age, made &s;uch inci&s;ions as drew forth the blood, which ran in torrents down each &s;ide of his face.</P>
<P>Now the riot became univer&s;al.&mdash;The old woman, enraged at the treatment &s;he had met with, &s;eized the hair of the young man with one hand, and, catch|ing up an earthen jug, which lay by her, with the other, made &s;uch a pow|erful application of it to his head, that, if his &s;cull had been formed of pene|trable materials, mu&s;t have done his bu&s;ine&s;s completely; however, quickly recovering, he turned round, and gave the old &s;ybil &s;uch a &s;troke on her face, as actually drove the remains of an old canine tooth, the only one left in her

head, fairly down her throat. The landlord interfered to put an end to the combat, when, unfortunately, in a &s;truggle for &s;uperiority between the old hag and her adver&s;ary, they over&s;et the &s;tools which &s;upported the coffin of the decea&s;ed, which, rolling on the floor, contributed to render the &s;cene more dreadful, and &s;o affrighted me, that, u&s;ing all the expedition I was able, I made my e&s;cape from a &s;cene that &s;truck me equally with terror and a|mazement. In my hurry out of the cabin I quite forgot to pay my reckon|ing, and would have in&s;tantly returned to di&s;charge it, if I had not been pre|vented by my fears.</P>

<P>AFTER running for a full hour, until I was quite out of breath, without once turning about or looking behind, I perceived, by the great quan|tity of &s;moke that i&s;&s;ued from a valley at a di&s;tance, that I was not very far from a town. Emboldened by this di&s;|covery I mended my pace, and arrived there ju&s;t as night began to &s;pread her
<PB N="42" REF="51">
&s;ooty wings over the darkening world. Overcome by my exertions I &s;at my&s;elf down at the door of a cabin, and began to ruminate in my mind what &s;tep I &s;hould pur&s;ue.&mdash;I looked over my mo|ney, and found it amounted to one &s;hilling and nine-pence halfpenny; a &s;um by no means incon&s;iderable in my eyes at that time.</P>
<P>As I &s;at brooding over my misfor|tunes, I was acco&s;ted by an old woman, who, perceiving me fatigued, invited me into her cabin, and offered me &s;ome butter-milk to a&s;&s;uage my thir&s;t. I thanked her for her kindne&s;s, and, find|ing her a humane, benevolent, poor creature, I told her of my di&s;tre&s;s, and unbo&s;omed my&s;elf to her with all the frankne&s;s of innocence. She pitied my &s;ituation, and offered me every &s;ervice
<PB N="43" REF="52">
in her power. She reque&s;ted me to re&s;t in her cabin that night, and that, in the morning, &s;he would inquire in the town, and &s;ee what &s;he could do for me. I would have gone and purcha&s;ed &s;ome|thing for &s;upper, not being willing to be too burden&s;ome to her; but &s;uch was her &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality that &s;he would not permit me.&mdash;She informed me that &s;he had buried her hu&s;band for many years, and owed her pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the goodne&s;s of her &s;on, (whom &s;he expect|ed to return home from his daily labour every minute,) and to what little &s;he could pick up by going out to nur&s;e in the town and neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Here &s;he broke off her di&s;cour&s;e to introduce me to her &s;on, who now en|tered the room, with a &s;cythe in his hand, the &s;harp part of which was bound
<PB N="44" REF="53">
round with hay. As &s;oon as he under|&s;tood my &s;ituation from his mother, he told me I was heartily welcome to my bed and my &s;upper; and, immediately taking a piece of dried beef, which hung &s;u&s;pended from the rafters of the cabin, cut a large &s;lice, and, giving it to his mother, reque&s;ted her to boil it that evening, with &s;ome potatoes, which he meant as an extraordinary dainty, pre|pared as a compliment to me, and to manife&s;t that hearty welcome, which is univer&s;ally paid by the inhabitants of Ireland to every &s;tranger that comes within their gates.</P>
<P>During the preparation of our home|ly repa&s;t, my kind ho&s;t entertained me with an account of the town, which, he informed me, was compo&s;ed principally of French families, or their de&s;cendents,
<PB N="45" REF="54">
who were, on the whole, a very good &s;ort of people; &mdash; that, as far as they were able, they gave bread to the poor; but, there being no manufactory of any &s;ort carried on in the place, the majo|rity of the inhabitants were frequently in very great di&s;tre&s;s for want of em|ployment.</P>
<P>By this time, our &s;upper being ready, we &s;at round the table, when, being naturally ba&s;hful and re&s;erved, I, at fir&s;t, are but &s;paringly; but the importunities of my kind ho&s;t and his mother at la&s;t removed all re&s;traint, and, giving way to the keenne&s;s of my appetite, I made a mo&s;t hearty &s;upper; after which we all prepared for re&s;t, my ho&s;t inviting me to a &s;hare of his bed. I undre&s;&s;ed, and, getting into bed, could hear my benefactor recommending him&s;elf to the
<PB N="46" REF="55">
protection of the Almighty with the mo&s;t fervent zeal and piety.</P>
<P>At that moment I could not avoid reflecting upon the great difference we perceive in the di&s;po&s;itions of the hu|man race, and formed a &s;triking con|tra&s;t between the behaviour of the young man and his mother, which appeared to me in a light &s;o perfectly amiable and prai&s;e-worthy, and the tyrannic, bru|tal, &s;pirit which actuated the brea&s;t and conduct of my late ma&s;ter:&mdash;young as I was, I &s;trove within my&s;elf to account for &s;uch a &s;eeming want of virtue in particular individuals; but, the &s;ubject being of a nature too deep and ab&s;tru&s;e for my comprehen&s;ion, I lo&s;t my&s;elf in conjecture, and &s;lept till morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the crowing of the cock proclaimed the return of day, my bed-fellow,
<PB N="47" REF="56">
&s;pringing from his humble couch, put on his clothes, and, &s;aying a &s;hort prayer, wi&s;hed me a good morning; and, taking his &s;cythe, proceeded to a re|newal of tho&s;e labours, in the execution of which his heart is happy, his fellow-creatures a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and his Creator plea|&s;ed.</P>
<P>After the departure of my friend I compo&s;ed my&s;elf to re&s;t a &s;econd time, and was awakened in the morning by my kind benefactre&s;s, who informed me, with great &s;atisfaction in her counte|nance, that &s;he believed &s;he had heard of a place that would &s;uit me. A phy|&s;ician of the town had parted with his &s;ervant the day before, and wanted a &s;mart boy to &s;upply his place.&mdash;"To be &s;ure," added &s;he, "the doctor is reckoned in the town but an odd &s;ort
<PB N="48" REF="57">
of a man, and is not over liberal to his dome&s;tics; but he is looked upon as extremely &s;kilful in his profe&s;&s;ion, and has a va&s;t deal of practice all over the country.&mdash;Now," &s;ays &s;he, if you are agreeable, I will &s;peak this morning to my friend, who &s;hall take you with him to the doctor."</P>
<P>I was overpowered with joy at the news, and eagerly thanked the poor woman for the intere&s;t &s;he had taken in my affairs; and, getting out of bed, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, to be ready to attend my new ma&s;ter when|ever I &s;hould be called upon.</P>

<P>AFTER waiting about a quarter of an hour, Mrs. Commins (for that was the name of my kind ho&s;te&s;s) re|turned, bringing with her a young man, who&s;e face, if it is to be con&s;idered as the index of his mind, proclaimed him to be remarkably &s;tupid.&mdash;"Here, Mr.

were &s;mall and black, yet piercing and animated; and, when he ro&s;e to receive us, I perceived that his knees formed two angles, which cro&s;&s;ed each other alternately as he walked.&mdash;He had on a large thick woollen night-cap, tied un|der the chin; a camblet gown, manu|factured in the good days of Queen Eli|zabeth; a black wai&s;tcoat, embrowned with &s;nuff, which he took in prodigious quantities; leather breeches, unbutton|ed at the knees; coar&s;e wor&s;ted &s;tock|ings, and a pair of green &s;lippers, that &s;eemed, by their patches and appear|ance, to have been in the doctor's &s;er|vice, a con&s;iderable time.&mdash;</P>

At the mention of the la&s;t article a &s;mile of complacency &s;tole acro&s;s the vi&s;age of the phy&s;ician, who, &s;troking me over
<PB N="56" REF="65">
the head, a&s;&s;ured me, that, if I became his &s;ervant, and behaved my&s;elf well, I &s;hould never want for proper encou|ragement. Upon my making a low bow, and thanking him, he bade me wait till he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for me.</P>
<P>Now Rhubarb and the doctor, ha|ving &s;eated them&s;elves by the fire-&s;ide, began to di&s;cour&s;e upon the effect of the &s;everal medicines that had been ad|mini&s;tered to Calomel's patients in the cour&s;e of the preceding week. By the cour&s;e of their ob&s;ervations, I &s;oon di&s;|covered, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, that gambouge and brick-du&s;t, Scotch &s;nuff, chalk, and vinegar, made up the prin|cipal part of every recipe that the doc|tor had i&s;&s;ued for the la&s;t twelve months, totally regardle&s;s of the di&s;order, whe|ther
<PB N="57" REF="66">
gout, fever, lax, pox, or con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>After this con&s;cientious phy&s;ician and his under&s;trapper had diverted them|&s;elves, at the expence of their patients, for &s;ome time, an object of mi&s;ery was brought in to the doctor for advice; upon which Mr. Rhubarb, wi&s;hing him a good morning, took his leave, and my ma&s;ter proceeded to examine the object alluded to, which was a woman turned of forty, with a pallid, emaci|ated, countenance, and her body and legs &s;o &s;welled with a drop&s;y that the members of her frame &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all proportion.</P>
<P>When the doctor had &s;urveyed her for a few minutes, he very gravely a&s;k|ed the poor &s;ufferer what &s;he wanted with him: &s;he replied, &s;he hoped, that,
<PB N="58" REF="67">
under heaven, he would cure her.&mdash; "Cure you, woman!" replies Calomel, "why, you're in a confirmed drop&s;y!" &mdash;"And is there no relief?" added &s;he, in a tone fraught with angui&s;h and de|&s;pair.&mdash; "Relief! aye, aye, I can relieve you, woman, as to that matter."&mdash; If you can," &s;ays the woe-begone wretch, lifting up her hands as in the act of prayer, "I pray that God may reward you hereafter."&mdash;"I have no &s;ort of objection to a reward <HI>here</HI> as well as hereafter; &mdash; you under&s;tand me."&mdash; Oh! &s;ir, I do," replies the unhappy being; "but, alas! I am poor, and have not the power;&mdash;I was left a widow, with a large family of young children, who will ince&s;&s;antly pray for your health and pro&s;perity."&mdash;"Aye, aye, my good woman," replies the di&s;ci|ple
<PB N="59" REF="68">
of Galen, "I am much obliged to you for the intention; &mdash; but, d'ye hear me? get home as fa&s;t as you can, and I'll contrive to give you &s;ome ea&s;e in about a couple of hours." &mdash;"In two hours, &s;ir!"&mdash;"Yes, I'll come and tap you, as they do the &s;mall-beer barrels, though, I'm a|fraid, for one quart of water I &s;hall find two of whi&s;key; is'nt &s;o? &mdash; Damme, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed if the whole country was in a drop&s;y; for three-fourths of their exi&s;tence are dedicated to drinking and &s;leeping." &mdash;"Oh! &s;ir," &s;ays the emaciated ob|ject, wounded to the quick at the cruel in&s;inuations of my ma&s;ter, "I a&s;&s;ure you I never drink &s;pirits of any kind." &mdash;"Oh! Lord, no, to be &s;ure," &s;ays the doctor, "you drink whi&s;key!&mdash;
<PB N="60" REF="69">
I beg your pardon; &mdash; no, no; &mdash; whi&s;key, indeed!" &s;ays he, "it's wa|ter!&mdash;yes, yes, you are all damned fond of water;&mdash;you &s;leep with wa|ter, get drunk with water, and wal|low about the &s;treets like a &s;ow in a dunghill! &mdash; however, good woman, go about your bu&s;ine&s;s." &mdash; Upon which the poor creature took her leave of this phy&s;ical brute with tears in her eyes.</P>
<P>She had &s;carce got out of the doors, when another unhappy claimant made his appearance. This was a young man, who, in thatching an outhou&s;e in the neighbourhood, by his foot &s;lipping, had fallen from the top of the building into the &s;treet, and broke his leg, and was conducted to the hou&s;e of Calo|mel to have it &s;et. (For the doctor was
<PB N="61" REF="70">
not only the principal phy&s;ician, but likewi&s;e &s;urgeon and man-midwife to half the county.) After they had pla|ced the unfortunate young man in a chair, my ma&s;ter began to examine the limb; while he was performing of which the poor fellow looked mo&s;t wi&s;tfully in the face of the doctor, as if anxious to learn his fate by the turn of his countenance, which Calomel percei|ving, he heightened the apprehen&s;ions of his patient by exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;ignificant grimaces, (in the whole art of which he was an adept,) and, at times, &s;haking his head, as if &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed about the con&s;equences of the fracture; which he continued to exer|ci&s;e, with other ge&s;ticulations, until he had worked upon the fears of the poor lad &s;o far, that, in the utmo&s;t vehe|mence
<PB N="62" REF="71">
of de&s;pair, he a&s;ked the doctor if he mu&s;t lo&s;e his leg? to which que&s;|tion Calomel replied in doubtful terms. He began to bewail his misfortune, which the doctor treated as a je&s;t, tell|ing him, at the wor&s;t he could but lo&s;e his leg, which was a circum&s;tance not &s;o unfortunate as was generally imagi|ned, when he con&s;idered the great &s;a|vings that are made in the articles of &s;hoes and &s;tockings. With a number of wittici&s;ms of this nature he enter|tained the mi&s;erable wretch (who lay writhing with pain) while he &s;et his limb; after effecting which he con&s;ign|ed him to the care of his friends, pro|mi&s;ing to call the next day to &s;ee how he went on.</P>
<P>By this time I had conceived the mo&s;t unconquerable aver&s;ion to my new
<PB N="63" REF="72">
ma&s;ter, both for his principles and prac|tice;&mdash;I looked upon him as a mon&s;ter, utterly devoid of humanity, callous to the misfortunes of his fellow-creatures, and a di&s;honour to his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>After the doctor had di&s;patched the young man with the fractured limb, he gave orders that he would &s;ee no more paupers that morning, as the hour had arrived when it was u&s;ual for him to vi&s;it his out-door patients. While he was adju&s;ting his wig, which forms no incon&s;iderable part of a phy&s;ician's con|&s;equence, his friend Rhubarb paid him a &s;econd vi&s;it. I &s;oon under&s;tood that this gentleman was as nece&s;&s;ary to the doctor's operations as his right arm.&mdash; I learned, from a neighbour, that Mr. Rhubarb was an apothecary in the town, who&s;e practice had been exceedingly di|mini&s;hed
<PB N="64" REF="73">
by the irregularities of his conduct, and more particularly by a &s;mall mi&s;take which he made in the re|cipe of another phy&s;ician, which was no other than admini&s;tering an emetic, of three times the &s;trength pre&s;cribed, to a young lady, the con&s;equence of which mi&s;take was no le&s;s than the in&s;tanta|neous death of the patient. As the phy&s;ician partook of the odium affixed to the blunder of the apothecary, and getting into di&s;repute, it proved a mat|ter of the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory nature to the malignant &s;pirit of Calomel, who &s;ecretly rejoiced at the event, ina&s;much as it was a deep wound to the reputa|tion of the phy&s;ician, who had hereto|fore been a formidable rival to Calomel upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="74">After giving me directions to tell any per&s;on who might call upon him that he &s;hould return in the afternoon, this redoubted &s;on of Galen, attended by his medical a&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;et out to vi&s;it a patient, who re&s;ided about four miles from the town, and to whom Calomel wi&s;hed to introduce Rhubarb as the apothecary;&mdash;for what rea&s;on, it is pre|&s;umed the reader is already &s;ufficiently acquainted.</P>

<ARGUMENT>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the departure of the doc|tor, and his brother in iniquity, I began to take an accurate &s;urvey of the apartment, which he dignified with the name of Study. In a gla&s;s ca&s;e, in the middle of the room, there was, pre&s;erved in &s;pirits of wine, a great va|riety
<PB N="67" REF="76">
of uncommon animals, in&s;ects, and reptiles, and, among the re&s;t, a human foetus, as it is &s;ituated in the womb after four months conception.</P>
<P>On the &s;helf, over the fire-place, were the &s;culls of an European, an African, and a monkey, by a compari&s;on of which I perceived that there was a &s;trong re&s;emblance between the <HI>cranium</HI> of a man and that of a monkey; but parti|cularly &s;o in that of the negro, the for|mation of which approached &s;o near to that of the monkey that there was &s;carce|ly any difference, except in the di&s;pro|portion of &s;ize.</P>
<P>His collection of books con&s;i&s;ted principally of Che&s;elden's Anatomy, a few numbers of the Medical Magazine, Cowper on midwifery, a French edi|tion
<PB N="68" REF="77">
of Boileau's poetry, a Latin dic|tionary, and an old bible.</P>
<P>In one corner of the room &s;tood a wig-block, unoccupied, and, in the other, a ca&s;e, containing an imperfect &s;keleton, at the fir&s;t &s;ight of which I thought I &s;hould have dropped dead with affright.</P>
<P>On a peg, in the middle of the room, hung a &s;carlet cloak, which, with &s;ix crazy chairs, a folding-table, and a draught-board, completed the furniture of the room.</P>
<P>When I had &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity, I began to peru&s;e Che&s;elden's Anatomy, and was amu&s;ing my&s;elf with looking at the cuts, when I heard a loud double knock at the door, on opening of which a gentleman on hor&s;eback inquired if Dr. Calomel was at home; to which I
<PB N="69" REF="78">
an&s;wered in the negative, but at the &s;ame time informed him, agreeably to his directions, that I expected him home to dinner; upon which the gentleman de&s;ired me to acquaint my ma&s;ter that his name was Rapine, and that he &s;hould do him&s;elf the favour to dine with him on his return from the inn, where he was going to put up his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger had not been gone from the door above half an hour when my ma&s;ter arrived, accompanied by his zeal|ous adherent, Rhubarb. He inquired if there had been any per&s;ons wanting him &s;ince he went out; upon which I informed him that Mr. Rapine had been there, and acquainted him with his in|tention of dining with him.</P>
<P>At the mention of the name of Ra|pine, I perceived the mu&s;cles of Calomel
<PB N="70" REF="79">
to di&s;tend with &s;miles of &s;ecret &s;atis|faction:&mdash; "Od-&s;o," &s;ays he, turning to Rhubarb, "a cou&s;in-german of mine from the north, from whom I have great expectations! &mdash; he is a great wit, a manufacturer of <HI>bons mots,</HI> and a very tolerable hand at the violin;&mdash; he has ama&s;&s;ed a prodigious &s;um in the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty."&mdash;"What, he's been &s;ome naval or military officer, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;ays Rhubarb, who, after a life &s;pent in honourable fatigue, has retired, to end his days in peace and &s;olitude beneath the &s;hade of his own laurels."&mdash;"Why, not exactly &s;o," replies the doctor, my cou&s;in has never had the honour of expo&s;ing his per&s;on on the quar|ter-deck of a man of war, or in de|fending a battery again&s;t the ap|proaches

of an enemy; no, my dear Rhubarb, excu&s;e me, we have no &s;uch fools in our family;&mdash;Mr. Ra|pine has &s;erved the king, it is true, but, between our&s;elves, where he &s;tu|died the intere&s;t of his maje&s;ty in one in&s;tance, he was wi&s;e enough to take care of his own in ten;&mdash;you under|&s;tand me," &s;ays Calomel, putting his finger to his no&s;e, with a &s;ignificant leer. &mdash;"Oh! perfectly well," &s;ays the pliant apothecary.&mdash;"He was, for the &s;pace of &s;even years," continues the doctor, a collector of exci&s;e at &mdash;, in the county of &mdash;; but &s;ome of his indirect practices being di&s;covered, in &s;pite of all his cunning and addre&s;s to hide them, he was, in con&s;equence, removed from his employment, but not quite de&s;titute, as my indefati|gable
<PB N="72" REF="81">
relation had taken care to ama&s;s a fortune in that &s;ituation, a|mounting to very near twenty thou|&s;and pounds." &mdash; Upon which my ma&s;ter retired into the kitchen, to give orders for &s;omething extraordinary for dinner that day, which he intended &s;hould be in a &s;tyle of elegance, &s;upe|rior to his ordinary mode of living, on purpo&s;e to entertain his wealthy kin&s;|man, and left poor Rhubarb in amaze|ment at the indu&s;try and enormity of Mr. Rapine's character; from which reverie he was awakened by the arrival of the doctor's gue&s;t, who entered the room with that &s;elf-con&s;equential mien, which is ever to be met with in tho&s;e worldly grublings, who have gathered and &s;craped a fortune at the expence of
<PB N="73" REF="82">
all the good and noble characteri&s;tics of a man.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;eated him&s;elf, when my ma&s;ter, running into the room, and embracing his cou&s;in, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf much honoured by his vi&s;it, which com|pliment Mr. Rapine returned with great formality and re&s;erve. The doctor &s;ei|zed his hat, whip, and coat, with that kind of ob&s;equious officiou&s;ne&s;s which would be highly painful to a generous mind; but it was what the doctor well knew would be extremely plea&s;ing to his vi&s;itor, the bent and turn of who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition he had long &s;tudied with a particular degree of attention.</P>
<P>The three worthies (for the doctor had invited Rhubarb to partake of the entertainment) trifled away the time in di&s;cour&s;e until I was di&s;patched by the
<PB N="74" REF="83">
hou&s;ekeeper (for the doctor was never married, having a peculiar aver&s;ion to the female &s;ex) to inform them that dinner was on the table; at which joy|ful &s;ummons I ob&s;erved Rhubarb to &s;mack his lips and rub his hands with great energy; but a vi&s;ible mortifica|tion and di&s;appointment appeared in his vi&s;age, when, ha&s;tening into the di|ning-parlour, he perceived the rigid oeconomy of the phy&s;ician's table; how|ever, after exhibiting &s;ome &s;mall &s;igns of &s;urprize, he &s;at down to dinner with his companions; which con&s;i&s;ted of a tureen of meagre broth,&mdash;the &s;canty re|mains of a &s;crag end of a neck of mut|ton,&mdash;a potatoe-pudding,&mdash;a di&s;h of <HI>col|canon,</HI> (which is no other than cabbage and kitchen-&s;tuff boiled and ma&s;hed to|gether;)&mdash;and, in compliment to Mr.
<PB N="75" REF="84">
Rapine, an antiquated goo&s;e, which had &s;een at lea&s;t three &s;ummers, was &s;erved up, &s;tuffed with &s;age, onions, and gar|lic.</P>
<P>As the goo&s;e &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t attractive object in the bill of fare, the apothecary, at the in&s;tigation of Ra|pine, &s;tuck his fork in the devoted fowl, and was proceeding to di&s;&s;ection, when an effluvium i&s;&s;ued from the &s;tuffing which di&s;concerted the fami&s;hed Rhubarb &s;o much, that he was obliged, in &s;pite of the voraciou&s;ne&s;s of his appetite, to forego the operation; the cau&s;e of which intolerable &s;tench was no other than a prudent manoeuvre of the phy&s;ician, who, knowing Rhubarb to be a capital hand at a knife and fork, and particu|larly fond of gee&s;e, had taken care to mix a little a&s;&s;afoetida with the &s;tuffing,
<PB N="76" REF="85">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure to allay the fury of his &s;tomach; and the expedient &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the a&s;toni&s;hed retailer of drugs had very nigh fainted under the influence of the noxious &s;mell; how|ever, after the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault was over, he re&s;umed his office, fini&s;hed the carving of the goo&s;e, and made &s;hift, in &s;pite of the a&s;&s;afoetida, to demoli&s;h two legs, a wing, part of the brea&s;t, a &s;ide bone, and afterwards ate the rump, made into a devil, to provoke his thir&s;t &s;o far, that, by drinking after dinner, he might revenge the affront at the expence of the doctor's wine.</P>
<P>But there he reckoned without his ho&s;t; for, as &s;oon as the table-cloth was removed, and Calomel had fini&s;hed his di&s;&s;ertation upon the virtues of a&s;&s;afoe|tida, and the good effects of moderation
<PB N="77" REF="86">
in eating, he entered upon another &s;ub|ject, for the benefit of his gue&s;ts, which was no other than a learned account of the numerous evils, which mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, follow the indulgence of our appetites, e&s;pecially in whatever had any relation to exce&s;&s;ive drinking; which, he a&s;&s;erted, not only degraded human nature to a level with brutality, but ab&s;olutely undermined and ruined the con&s;titution beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of relief. The doctor intreated them not to di&s;regard his doctrine; for he &s;hrewd|ly ob&s;erved, that he had been feed very highly for advice that was not a tenth part &s;o &s;alutary; but, as they were his particular friends, he &s;hould be &s;uffi|ciently recompen&s;ed in their enjoyment of a good &s;tate of health.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="87">When he had fini&s;hed this well-timed exordium, he called for the remains of a bottle of port, and, at the &s;ame time, a mug of ale, and a decanter of &s;pring-water. He placed the bottle before his relation, the water before him&s;elf, and the ale before the apothecary. Upon the latter per&s;on's appearing &s;omewhat di&s;&s;atisfied at his allowance, the doctor recommended it to his palate in &s;uch terms, as his friend Rhubarb did not think it proper or prudent, at that time, to call in que&s;tion, but took copious draughts of the homely beverage; the excellent flavour of which he extolled to the &s;kies, while his heart was tormented at an indignity, which he had neither &s;pirit nor capability of re&s;enting.</P>
<P>Upon Mr. Rapine's inquiring into the trade of the town, and the amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="79" REF="88">
of its inhabitants, the doctor gave him the following account.&mdash;</P>
<P>"P&mdash;t&mdash;g&mdash;n is a town," &s;ays the phy&s;ician, "that is extremely &s;ingular, in every point of view. It owes the little importance it enjoys to the &s;et|tlement of a few vagrant French fa|milies, who fled from oppre&s;&s;ion in their own country, about half a cen|tury ago, to take up their abode in a land which they de&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash;Their de|&s;cendents, who form the principal part of the inhabitants at the pre&s;ent day, have carefully pre&s;erved the lit|tle pride and narrow prejudices of their forefathers, to which they have annexed that &s;pirit of idlene&s;s and negligence of improvement which are &s;o con&s;picuous in this country; and, what renders their follies the more
<PB N="80" REF="89">
lamentable is, that, from &s;ome un|accountable combination of events, the children of one-third of our peo|ple of di&s;tinction are &s;ent here to im|bibe the fir&s;t rudiments of their edu|cation, which, doubtle&s;s, in a great degree e&s;tabli&s;hes their manners ever after; and, to give you an in&s;tance of the qualification of the ma&s;ters of the&s;e infantine &s;eminaries, I will re|late to you an account of the birth, knowledge, and endowments, of my neighbour, Mon&s;ieur de Champignon, who is con&s;idered as the pink of good-breeding and flower of all &s;chool-ma&s;ters."</P>
<P><Q>De Champignon is a native of Bourdeaux, in the South of France. His father was Merry-Andrew to a <HI>charlatan,</HI> and his mother &s;ervant and
<PB N="81" REF="90">
<HI>confidante</HI> to a <HI>figurante</HI> at the opera. My neighbour (who&s;e birth, you will admit, is not in the lea&s;t illu&s;trious) derived from his parents tho&s;e quali|ties, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, with a &s;mall portion of indu&s;try, are &s;uffi|cient to make a fortune;&mdash;you will naturally conclude I mean &s;ervility and impudence, which, as he grew towards manhood, were matured and directed by the in&s;tructions of his pa|rents; and he profited by their ad|monitions &s;o well, that, after a &s;eries of twelve years, laudably &s;pent in &s;tudying mankind, and making him|&s;elf, on all occa&s;ions, even the mo&s;t infamous, an in&s;trument of plea&s;ure to his betters, he wormed him&s;elf into the good graces of a certain ri|diculous baronet, who advi&s;ed him
<PB N="82" REF="91">
to &s;et up a &s;chool, and teach the French tongue, for his perfect know|ledge of which he undertook to be re&s;pon&s;ible, though, between our|&s;elves, the baronet him&s;elf cannot &s;peak ten words of the language.&mdash; De Champignon followed the advice of his patron, and, under his pro|tection, has, in a few years, reali&s;ed fortune &s;ufficient to ride in his own carriage, and look down with di&s;dain on tho&s;e poor beings, who have been weak enough to be guided through life by principles of virtue and mo|rality.</Q></P>
<P>Upon Rapine's te&s;tifying &s;ome a&s;to|ni&s;hment at the account, the doctor ap|pealed to Rhubarb, who, notwith&s;tand|ing his knowledge of one half of the &s;tory to be fal&s;e, nodded his head in to|ken
<PB N="83" REF="92">
of an acknowledgement of the truth.</P>
<P>"As to the amu&s;ements of the town," &s;ays Calomel, "they are equally under the influence of ab&s;urdity.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM my frequent conver&s;ations with my ma&s;ter's hou&s;ekeeper, (who&s;e good opinion I cultivated with the mo&s;t &s;olicitous a&s;&s;iduity,) I &s;oon found out that the eccentricity of the
<PB N="89" REF="98">
doctor's genius, and the want of huma|nity that too frequently attended his &s;urgical operations, had procured him no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of enemies; the ill effects of which he very frequently experienced by numberle&s;s little tricks that were practi&s;ed upon him, to his great mortification and di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>Before I had been quite a fortnight in Calomel's &s;ervice, I was a witne&s;s to one of the&s;e impo&s;itions, which had like to have proved, in its con|&s;equences, of a very &s;erious nature.&mdash; Among the number of the doctor's mo&s;t formidable enemies was one 'Squire Haw&s;er, who lived upon the &s;ide of a mountain, about nine miles from P&mdash;n. He had &s;erved his country on-board a man of war, and pa&s;&s;ed through the different gradations
<PB N="90" REF="99">
of the &s;ervice, from mid&s;hipman to captain, with di&s;tingui&s;hed honour; but, having a fortune of fifteen hundred a year left him by a di&s;tant relation, at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, he re&s;igned his naval command, and retired to &s;pend the remainder of his life in the im|provement of his e&s;tate, the protection of the poor, and the enjoyment of his friend.</P>
<P>The captain had not been &s;ettled a month in his e&s;tate, when his groom, breaking-in a young colt, at the imme|diate de&s;ire of his ma&s;ter, was thrown from the back of the re&s;tive bea&s;t with &s;uch violence, that it was apprehended his &s;cull was fractured. Calomel, as a &s;urgeon of the highe&s;t repute for ana|tomical &s;kill in the county, was &s;ent for in great ha&s;te. After examining the
<PB N="91" REF="100">
confu&s;ion, he treated their fears on the poor man's account with great plea|&s;antry; at the &s;ame time affirming, that, whatever he might do by hanging, he would venture to a&s;&s;ure him that he would never lo&s;e his life by a fracture, the comfortable thickne&s;s of his &s;cull putting any &s;uch accident at defiance. In &s;hort, by his neglect of the mi&s;erable patient, (for the doctor con&s;idered the life of a poor individual as of no more importance to &s;ociety than that of a dog,) the man langui&s;hed in great tor|ment for a few days, and then ex|pired.</P>
<P>After his death, the captain, for his own &s;atisfaction, had his &s;cull exami|ned, when it was clearly perceived that an ab&s;olute fracture had taken place, but one of that nature, that if any, the
<PB N="92" REF="101">
mo&s;t ordinary, care had been taken of it, the &s;ufferer might have &s;urvived, and done well. Upon this information, the captain (who&s;e heart overflowed with the milk of human kindne&s;s) &s;wore, that, if ever he met with Calomel, he would take the mo&s;t exemplary ven|geance on him for his cruelty to his dome&s;tic, who&s;e death the generous Haw&s;er could not help thinking was, in a great mea&s;ure, unhappily, though innocently, owing to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The threats of the captain had long &s;ince reach the ears of Calomel, which operated upon his fears &s;o powerfully (for the doctor, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, was the mo&s;t arrant coward upon the face of nature) that he left no &s;tone unturned to bring about a reconcilia|tion.
<PB N="93" REF="102">
Among the foremo&s;t of his ad|vocates on this occa&s;ion was a Mr. Wil&s;on, a relation of the captain, who promi&s;ed the phy&s;ician to u&s;e his intere&s;t with Haw&s;er in his behalf. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances coming to the ears of &s;ome wags, who re&s;ided in the neighbour|hood, and who entertained likewi&s;e a mo&s;t inveterate aver&s;ion to the doctor, they re&s;olved, in clo&s;e divan, to exe|cute a trick upon him, which they ef|fected in the following manner:&mdash;they bribed one of the captain's &s;ervants to lend his livery-coat to one of their party, whom they &s;ent to Calomel with the following letter, which was to be delivered into his own hands, written from the implacable Haw&s;er.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The doctor was at home, playing a game at backgammon with his friend Rhubarb, when the fictitious &s;ervant delivered the above-written letter. When the phy&s;ician fir&s;t &s;aw the &s;ervant's li|very, which he well knew, a thou&s;and fears crouded into his brain in an in|&s;tant; but, when he opened the letter, and &s;aw the contents, which he read aloud with exultation, the&s;e unplea&s;ing ideas vani&s;hed, and joy and &s;atisfaction &s;at triumphant in his countenance.&mdash;It
<PB N="96" REF="105">
was &s;ome minutes before he could com|pletely overcome the a&s;toni&s;hment which the receipt of this letter occa&s;ioned; at la&s;t he recovered him&s;elf &s;o far as to de|&s;ire the &s;ervant to give his be&s;t re&s;pects to the captain, and to inform him that he &s;hould do him&s;elf the honour to wait upon him with all convenient &s;peed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;ervant was gone,&mdash; "There," &s;ays the doctor, handing the letter to Rhubarb, what d'ye think of me now? am I to con&s;ider my&s;elf in|debted to my abilities as a phy&s;ician for this conde&s;cen&s;ion in the captain, or the kindne&s;&s;es of my friend Wil|&s;on?"&mdash;"I &s;hould rather imagine that you are obliged intirely to your abilities, doctor," &s;ays the humble para&s;ite, "which, without flattery, may be placed in the &s;ame cla&s;s with a
<PB N="97" REF="106">
Boerhaave, a Cel&s;us, or an Hippo|crates, and are, indeed, if properly known, the glory of your country."&mdash; You are perfectly in the right, Rhu|barb," replies the doctor, your re|marks are pertinent and ju&s;t;&mdash;dam|me if I ever thought before that you had half the di&s;cernment which I find you po&s;&s;e&s;s." The mode&s;t apothe|cary bowed his head for the compli|ment, while my ma&s;ter de&s;ired me to get his two hor&s;es, Sorrel and Slyboots, &s;addled immediately, and to bring them round to the hall-door, while he drew on his boots.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the con&s;i|deration of the fee, which he already touched in imagination, the thoughts of being reconciled to Haw&s;er, who&s;e re&s;entment he dreaded little le&s;s than
<PB N="98" REF="107">
that of the devil him&s;elf, or the well|timed compliments of Rhubarb upon his phy&s;ical &s;kill, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that then, and only then, for the fir&s;t time in his life, a &s;park of liberality illumined his &s;ordid heart, &s;o far, that he ab&s;olutely called for a bottle of port, which he in|vited Rhubarb to partake of; and, as &s;mall pre&s;&s;ing is nece&s;&s;ary where the mind is willing, the apothecary com|plied; and &s;o warmly did they &s;acrifice to Bacchus, while the potation la&s;ted, that they fini&s;hed the bottle in &s;ome|thing more than ten minutes, drinking &s;ucce&s;s to the faculty, and a general in|di&s;po&s;ition to the re&s;t of mankind. At the death of the la&s;t gla&s;s, it was very ap|parent that the phy&s;ician's under&s;tand|ing was &s;omewhat wounded, when he
<PB N="99" REF="108">
ro&s;e from his &s;eat to ride with all ha&s;te to Mount Binnacle.</P>
<P>But this progre&s;s was retarded by an unlucky accident, which di&s;comfited poor Calomel very much. When I had &s;addled the hor&s;es, and, agreeably to my ma&s;ter's directions, brought them round to the hall-door, he called me in to help him on with his boots; and, while I was performing that part of my duty, &s;ome mi&s;chievous boys had contrived to tie the prickly part of a goo&s;eberry-bu&s;h under the tail of the doctor's hor&s;e, which, in his great hurry to depart, he did not perceive when he got on hor&s;e|back; but, the in&s;tant he be&s;trided his old favourite, Sorrel, the bea&s;t began to kick and rear up in a manner that threw the phy&s;ician into the utmo&s;t terrors. However, in&s;pired by the fumes of his
<PB N="100" REF="109">
own port, he ventured to clap his &s;purs in the &s;ides of Sorrel, who, being unu|&s;ed to &s;uch an unwelcome &s;alutation, and irritated by the bu&s;h at his po&s;te|riors, &s;prang forward, and began to plunge with his rider with great fury, and pre&s;ently unburdened Calomel of his hat and wig; upon which the doc|tor (who was a timid hor&s;eman) clung fa&s;t hold of the mane; but, notwith|&s;tanding all the phy&s;ician's prudence, and in &s;pite of his cries to the people to &s;top the hor&s;e, Sorrel &s;et off in a full gallop, and never cea&s;ed till he came to the confines of a wet bog, into which, with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain, he threw the unfortunate &s;on of Galen, who now &s;tuck in the filth up to the arm-pits, roaring out for help with the lungs of a Sten|tor.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="110">As &s;oon as I &s;aw Sorrel gallop off with my ma&s;ter, I followed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, attended by numbers of the town's people, who, &s;o far from pity|ing his mi&s;chance, &s;eemed to be grati|fied at the doctor's na&s;ty &s;ituation. After many intreaties on my part, and un|numbered prayers on his, we prevailed on an old woman and a travelling-tin|ker to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in re&s;cuing the cre&s;t-fallen Calomel from the imminent pe|rils with which he was &s;urrounded. Im|mediately upon his relea&s;e he kneeled, and returned his Creator thanks for his timely delivery. (For I forgot to re|mark that the doctor was apparently very religious, though he did not po&s;|&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle grain of charity.)</P>
<P>By this time we were joined by his friend Rhubarb, who, after wiping his
<PB N="102" REF="111">
clothes, helped me to place the doctor on my hor&s;e, which was quiet enough: (being a mi&s;erable bea&s;t, which he had received as part of payment from a poor widow, with &s;even young children, for his attendance on her hu&s;band, who had late|ly died in a high fever.) In this man|ner we re-conducted him to town, when, after rubbing his temples with vinegar, and giving him a large gla&s;s of brandy, we recruited his &s;pirits &s;o far, that he &s;ent me to the inn for a po&s;t-chai&s;e, while he put on &s;ome clean clothes and linen, determined that neither the ex|pence of the chai&s;e, nor the con&s;e|quences of the accident, &s;hould be the means of lo&s;ing &s;o profitable a patient as Captain Haw&s;er, which he might do, if he did not pay that attention to his
<PB N="103" REF="112">
letter which a man of his &s;pirit and con&s;equence naturally expected.</P>
<P>Being &s;trictly enjoined to make ha&s;te, I pre&s;ently returned with the chai&s;e, into which the doctor &s;tepped, (having already cleaned him&s;elf,) amid the gibes and &s;neers of a concour&s;e of the neigh|bours, who &s;urrounded the carriage.&mdash; After giving the po&s;t-chai&s;e boy direc|tions to drive to Mount Binnacle with all imaginable expedition, I got on my Bucephalus, and followed my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary here to inform the reader of the &s;ituation of affairs at Mount Binnacle at the time of our ar|rival.&mdash;Captain Haw&s;er, who had ac|tually been confined with the gout for a con&s;iderable time, (a circum&s;tanee that Calomel well knew,) was, about an hour before we paid him our vi&s;it, &s;ei|zed
<PB N="104" REF="113">
with one of tho&s;e paroxy&s;ms that are attendant on the di&s;order, which, for the time, by the acute pain they create, almo&s;t deprive the patient of his &s;en&s;es, and which, working on the active di&s;po&s;ition of Haw&s;er, rendered him peevi&s;h, and inflamed him to the highe&s;t pitch of irritability. Added to this, he had ju&s;t received an account of the lo&s;s of the &s;hip he had formerly commanded, with all her crew, (among whom were &s;ome of his deare&s;t friends,) in the Gulf of Florida, in a hard gale of wind. The&s;e circum&s;tances, combi|ning, made the celebrated de&s;cent of Orpheus into hell journeying through a path of ro&s;es, in compari&s;on to that which the devoted, dete&s;ted, but &s;elf-&s;ufficient, Calomel was about to under|take.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="114">As &s;oon as we reached the iron gates, at the entrance of the park, I rang the bell; when the porter (who had recei|ved his in&s;tructions, accompanied with a bribe) opened the gates for the doc|tor with marks of great re&s;pect, which Calomel thought proceeded intirely from the directions of his ma&s;ter; and, giving him &s;ixpence, he inquired after the health of the captain, when the &s;ervant inform|ed him that he was in the greate&s;t ago|nies with the gout; which corre&s;pond|ing with the account he had received, he &s;aid, <Q>Aye, aye, my friend, but I'll &s;oon put him upon his legs, I war|rant you.</Q>&mdash;Then, ordering the po&s;t-chai&s;e boy to drive up to the door, he commanded me to knock, which, to do my ma&s;ter honour, I did &s;o loud and &s;o
<PB N="106" REF="115">
long, that, I verily believe, it might have been heard at five miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The captain, thinking, by the loud|ne&s;s of the knock, that it was a vi&s;it from a neighbouring peer, whom he ex|pected, hurried off the &s;opha, on which he was lying, enjoying a little momentary ea&s;e from his &s;ufferings, and, getting upon his crutches, hobbled towards the door to receive him. But, what arti&s;t can paint the look of Haw&s;er, when, in&s;tead of the expected nobleman, the dete&s;ted Calomel pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore him! &mdash; it was a combination of rage, horror, and a&s;toni&s;hment; &mdash; his eyes darted with indignant fire, and his lips trembled with aggravation; which the poor doctor perceiving, and unfor|tunately attributing both that and his &s;ilence to the great angui&s;h he was un|dergoing,
<PB N="107" REF="116">
he walked up with the ut|mo&s;t confidence to the captain, and was attempting to feel his pul&s;e; when Haw|&s;er, recovering the u&s;e of his faculties, and collecting all the might he was ma&s;ter of, with one &s;troke of his crutch (for he was a large, athletic, man) &s;truck the exulting Calomel &s;uch a tremendous blow on the &s;cull as felled him in&s;tant|ly to the ground, where he lay ga&s;ping and kicking for life, like a wounded &s;almon in a fi&s;hing-boat, till a repeti|tion of the blow put a period to his ca|pering.</P>
<P>He now lay extended at his length, and &s;peechle&s;s as Harry the Eighth in his tomb at We&s;tmin&s;ter, when this ira|&s;cible commander ordered his &s;ervants to take the body to the hor&s;e-pond, which they gladly obeyed; and, taking
<PB N="108" REF="117">
hold each of an arm and a leg, they conveyed the fallen victim to a large pool, in a yard adjoining the hou&s;e, which &s;erved as a re&s;ervoir for all the filth and ordure of the family, (the cap|tain following on his crutches, to &s;ee his orders &s;trictly obeyed,) into which, without either caution or mercy, like Fal&s;taff's fat paunch, hi&s;&s;ing hot, they plunged the pummelled carca&s;e of this redoubted prime mini&s;ter of death, who did not recover the u&s;e of his &s;peech until the third time of ri&s;ing in the wa|ter, when he had ju&s;t &s;trength enough left to crawl to the &s;ide, and &s;hake off a part of the mud and dung, with which he was very near being &s;uffocated.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he could &s;peak, and un|der&s;tood his &s;ituation, in &s;pite of his terrors, he threatened to pro&s;ecute Haw|&s;er
<PB N="109" REF="118">
for damages; when the captain, damning him for his impudence, order|ed the large ma&s;tiff in the yard to be unchained, which Calomel perceiving, he took to his heels, and ran for his life with the &s;wiftne&s;s of a greyhound, and had got within a few yards of the iron gate, at the entrance of the park, when the dog &s;eized the poor phy&s;ician by the breech, and did not quit his hold till he had torn his clothes all to frag|ments, and had not left a piece of his breeches or a remnant of his &s;hirt hang|ing together, when the &s;ervants, pro|bably apprehen&s;ive of his lo&s;ing his life, took the ma&s;tiff off, and left the mi&s;e|rable Calomel on the ground, ga&s;ping for life, and intirely de&s;titute of a rag to cover him.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE arrived home, after the de|plorable expedition to Mount Binnacle, about eight o'clock in the evening; my ma&s;ter having charged the po&s;tillion not to enter the town until it was quite dark, le&s;t his di&s;grace &s;hould be di&s;covered, which he knew would be treated only as a je&s;t by the neighbour|hood,
<PB N="112" REF="121">
unaccompanied with either pity or a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had got &s;afe into his own hou&s;e, he threw him&s;elf into a chair, and, after &s;ighing mo&s;t piteou&s;ly for a few minutes, began to talk very loud in the French language, which, from the &s;mall knowledge of it that I had gleaned, I &s;oon under&s;tood to be a vol|ley of cur&s;es, which he uttered with all the ge&s;tures of a man in the la&s;t &s;tage of horror and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When his rage had a little &s;ub&s;ided, by the entreaties of his hou&s;ekeeper he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be conveyed to bed, where he had not been above an hour before I carried him a ba&s;on of hot wa|ter-gruel, and found him a&s;leep, but, at the &s;ame time, furiou&s;ly agitated, talking as in a dream, and frequently repeating
<PB N="113" REF="122">
the words death, damages, and damna|tion. At la&s;t I ventured to awake him, and, &s;itting upright in the bed, he &s;ei|zed the gruel, and, being in&s;en&s;ible, at|tempted to drink it off at a draught, like &s;o much water, when the hot be|verage &s;calded his throat in &s;o &s;hocking a manner that he roared out like a goad|ed bull, and, laying hold of my ear, (which he &s;queezed without mercy,) en|deavoured to throw the remainder of the gruel in my face; but, perceiving his intention, and bobbing down my head, he threw it directly in the face of the hou&s;ekeeper, who had ju&s;t entered the apartment to inquire after his health; which &s;alutation made her &s;hriek and roar, not le&s;s loud, though infinitely more di&s;cordant, than the doctor. After running about the chamber, menacing
<PB N="114" REF="123">
vengeance again&s;t the author of her pain, and dancing as frantic as a drunk|en Welchman on the fir&s;t of March, &s;he flew to the bed, and, tearing down the clothes, (under which the doctor had retreated from her fury,) began to belabour the head, &s;houlders, and flank, of poor Calomel with a pair of tremen|dous fi&s;ts, which, for &s;ize and &s;inewy &s;trength, were equal to tho&s;e of any brui&s;er in the Briti&s;h dominions. After &s;he had amu&s;ed her&s;elf, at the expence of the doctor's bones, for a few minutes, he, being unable to bear the effect of her vengeance any longer, &s;uddenly turned round, and, fa&s;tening his teeth in the left arm of this dome&s;tic Tha|le&s;tris, obliged her to de&s;i&s;t from the farther pro&s;ecution of her re&s;entment. A parley now took place, and, mutual
<PB N="115" REF="124">
apologies having pa&s;&s;ed between them, they put the be&s;t complexion they were able upon their &s;everal di&s;a&s;ters; and the hou&s;ekeeper, repairing to the kitchen to dre&s;s her wounds, left her ma&s;ter groaning under the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ure of a train of evils, which had pur&s;ued him without intermi&s;&s;ion in the cour&s;e of that memorable day, while I &s;lunk to my homely bed, compo&s;ed of an old mat|tre&s;s &s;tuffed with &s;traw, to &s;eek repo&s;e in the arms of Morpheus.</P>
<P>The next morning, at the u&s;ual hour, the ill-fated doctor made his appear|ance; but &s;o rueful and dejected, and &s;o black and blue with the brui&s;es that he had received, that it was &s;carcely po&s;|&s;ible to know him. After giving orders to be denied to every per&s;on that &s;hould call upon him, excepting his a&s;&s;ociate,
<PB N="116" REF="125">
Rhubarb, he began to practi&s;e every expedient that could heal his wounds, and render him fit once more to mingle with &s;ociety; and, after being a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in his own hou&s;e for a week, he began to venture abroad, having al|mo&s;t wholly recovered by that time his u&s;ual pertne&s;s and vivacity.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t &s;allied forth among his acquaintance, he was &s;oon convinced that the calamities which befel him at Mount Binnacle were no &s;ecret. One a&s;ked him, with &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s, after the captain's health; another con|gratulated him upon his reconciliation with &s;o opulent and re&s;pectable a fami|ly; while a third inquired, with prodi|gious eagerne&s;s, after the &s;tate of his own health, which, he a&s;&s;ured him, he heard with great &s;orrow had confined him to
<PB N="117" REF="126">
his bed-chamber; <Q>I heard it was a violent fit of the rheumati&s;m,</Q> cried a fourth; a fifth a&s;&s;erted it was an ague; and a &s;ixth heard it was a fever. At la&s;t, after a &s;ullen &s;ilence on the part of Calomel during their impertinent in|quiries, he &s;topped their mouths by in|forming them that they were all right; for he really had been &s;uffering for &s;ome days from a complication of di&s;orders, which, from the various &s;ymptoms he had experienced, bore &s;ome &s;ort of affi|nity to the different complaints allu|ded to.</P>
<P>As it is frequently &s;aid, that we may even extract good out of evil, I was tempted to hope that the doctor's mis|fortunes would make him reflect upon his own want of humanity: indeed, not|with&s;tanding the ba&s;ene&s;s of his di&s;po|&s;ition,
<PB N="118" REF="127">
I &s;aw him reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of abject humiliation that I could not avoid pitying him; and, as I per|ceived that he talked le&s;s and thought more than u&s;ual, I had no doubt of his amendment.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as my ma&s;ter was convin|ced that the &s;ad i&s;&s;ue of his jour|ney to Captain Haw&s;er was known all over the country, he determined to apply for ju&s;tice, and endeavour, by procuring large damages again&s;t him,
<PB N="120" REF="129">
to &s;atisfy him&s;elf for the indignities he had &s;uffered and the dangers he had undergone: but the character of Calo|mel was &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, and that of his aggre&s;&s;or &s;o generally re&s;pected, that he could not, with all his art and indu&s;try, procure a bill to be returned by the grand jury; &s;o the doctor was reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of chewing the cud of re&s;entment in &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding his late di&s;|graces, his practice, in the joint capa|cities of phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, was by no means dimini&s;hed, and, as man-mid|wife, he brought more children into the world than half the <HI>accoucheurs</HI> in the country. Being retained by a young butcher in the town to attend his wife during her pregnancy, (who was remark|ably
<PB N="121" REF="130">
hand&s;ome,) the doctor's evil ge|nius, who never intirely for&s;ook him, took an active part in the affair, which terminated greatly to his di&s;&s;atisfaction. One morning, when he paid a vi&s;it to Mrs. Marrowbone, (for that was the name of his fair patient,) there happen|ed to be pre&s;ent a mi&s;chievous go&s;&s;ip, to whom the doctor had formerly given offence, and who, to be revenged, took e&s;pecial care to repre&s;ent the carriage and behaviour of Calomel in &s;uch a di&s;|advantageous light to the hu&s;band of Mrs. Marrowbone, that he determi|ned to watch the doctor's motions, and, if ever he di&s;covered any impro|priety or indelicacy, on the part of the phy&s;ician, towards his wife, to take am|ple revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="131">One day, when the doctor had been dining at the table of an acquaintance, where he drank more than a <HI>quantum &s;ufficit</HI> of wine, (for he always exceed|ed the bounds of di&s;cretion, in that par|ticular, when it was attended with no expence to him&s;elf,) on his return home, as he pa&s;&s;ed by Mrs. Marrowbone's door, he &s;tepped in, to a&s;k her how &s;he was. The butcher, who accidentally &s;aw the doctor go into his hou&s;e in the evening, and &s;u&s;pecting his intentions to be carnally, and not phy&s;ically, di|rected, followed him in, and getting, unperceived, into an adjoining clo&s;et to the room, in which his wife was then &s;itting, put his eye to a crevice, whence he could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h every thing that pa&s;&s;ed. He had not remained long in that &s;ituation, when his at|tention
<PB N="123" REF="132">
was rouzed, and his temper, (naturally jealous,) was fired, by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of the doctor towards his wife, which he conceived to border upon too much familiarity. The fact is, the phy&s;ician's &s;pirits had been wound up to a high pitch of vivacity by his friend's wine and cheerful conver&s;ation, which operated &s;o powerfully upon his actions that he could not avoid mix|ing a little &s;mattering of gallantry in his dialogue with Mrs. Marrowbone, (though, to do him ju&s;tice, in his &s;ober moments he had as little de&s;ire for the fine&s;t woman in the creation as a Jew rabbi for a pork-&s;teak,) and the doctor even proceeded &s;o far in his indi&s;cre|tions as to attempt to ravi&s;h a ki&s;s; which the butcher perceiving from his hiding-place, he bur&s;t into the room,

and, before Calomel could recover from the con&s;ternation into which this un|&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it threw him, made him an in&s;tantaneous pre&s;ent of &s;uch a vio|lent blow in the eye, with all the force he was able, as drove the ball fairly into the &s;ocket, and &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed his optic nerves, that every object in the 100m &s;eemed to the doctor to be dan|cing before him; but, upon receiving another blow upon the &s;tomach, equally &s;alutary, he mea&s;ured his length upon the floor, and crept under the bed with all the dexterity he was able; whence he was drawn out by the enraged butcher, who, throwing Calomel upon his back, kneeled upon his brea&s;t, while he whet|ted a long knife which hung by his &s;ide, and &s;wore, with the mo&s;t dreadful im|precations, that he would in&s;tantly di&s;|qualify
<PB N="125" REF="136">
the doctor from all attempts of that nature for the future; and was pro|ceeding to put his threats in execution, when the phy&s;ician, with uplifted hands, and his eyes &s;wimming in tears, intreated the butcher, for the love of God, to de|&s;i&s;t from his bloody purpo&s;e, every now and then interlarding his prayers with crying <HI>murder</HI> as loud as he was able. Upon hearing the noi&s;e, &s;ome of the neighbours ru&s;hed in, and prevailed on the butcher to relea&s;e him, which at length he con&s;ented to with infinite re|luctance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the doctor got fairly out of the door, he &s;et off, running as fa&s;t as if Satan him&s;elf had been in pur&s;uit of him, and never &s;topped to look back until he was quite at his own door, at which knocking lu&s;tily, I ran in ha&s;te
<PB N="126" REF="137">
to open it, and there &s;aw my mi&s;erable ma&s;ter with one eye &s;welled as it were out of his head, and his face covered with blood and dirt. The in&s;tant he got in, the hou&s;ekeeper, &s;eeing his dirty condition, brought him &s;ome warm wa|ter to wa&s;h his face, after which he in|formed us of every particular, &s;wearing that he would never re&s;t in his bed until he got revenge for &s;o unparalleled an outrage.</P>
<P>When he had got his face cleaned, and a bandage to his eye, he flapped his hat, and walked out to a ju&s;tice of the peace, who lived within a few paces of his own hou&s;e, at the &s;ame time de|&s;iring me to follow him; and, after pre|&s;enting him&s;elf before the ju&s;tice, he made his complaint in very moving terms; upon hearing which, his wor|&s;hip
<PB N="127" REF="138">
commi&s;erated his misfortunes, and a&s;&s;ured him that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done him.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate &s;ent his &s;ervant im|mediately to the butcher to de&s;ire him to attend, and reque&s;ted my ma&s;ter to &s;it down until his arrival. After wait|ing about half an hour, in came Mar|rowbone, with his wife and half a &s;core neighbours; and &s;o far was the doctor from gaining any &s;atisfaction, that, in the cour&s;e of the butcher's depo&s;ition, he had eloquence enough to convince the magi&s;trate (who was not one of the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind) that Calomel meant no le&s;s than to di&s;honour him; which depo&s;ition was &s;trengthened by the evi|dence of the wife and two of the neigh|bours; upon which, in &s;pite of all the doctor's prote&s;tations of innocence, the
<PB N="128" REF="139">
ju&s;tice advi&s;ed him to make up the mat|ter with the butcher in the be&s;t manner he was able; at the &s;ame time caution|ing the phy&s;ician again&s;t all &s;uch at|tempts for the future.</P>
<P>The poor doctor foamed at the mouth with vexation, and even went &s;o far as to charge the ju&s;tice with partiality in the proceeding, which the other recei|ved in &s;uch dudgeon, that he told Ca|lomel, if he was in the hu&s;band's place, he would not only &s;ue him for damages, (which no court of ju&s;tice, he &s;aid, would refu&s;e on &s;uch corroborating evi|dence,) but would publi&s;h the &s;tory to the world, and ruin his character. This la&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of the magi&s;trate alarmed the doctor very much, who now, lower|ing his note, declared he was willing to di&s;mi&s;s the parties; to which propo&s;al
<PB N="129" REF="140">
the butcher was &s;o far from agreeing, that he demanded reparation for the in|jury he had received; in which he was &s;upported by the magi&s;trate as a matter perfectly ju&s;t and equitable. The ap|prehen&s;ion of being expo&s;ed, in that &s;i|tuation, to the world, wrought upon the doctor &s;o forcibly, that he a&s;ked the butcher what &s;um he expected; Mar|rowbone replied, he would drop the affair for a con&s;ideration of forty gui|neas; to which propo&s;al the phy&s;ician, who would as &s;oon have parted with &s;o many ounces of his heart's blood, re|maining inexorable, the ju&s;tice inter|fered, and &s;ettled the &s;um at twenty guineas. At la&s;t, both parties agree|ing, with great reluctance the doctor depo&s;ited the &s;um, and walked out of the magi&s;trate's hou&s;e without wi&s;hing

him a good evening, grumbling and muttering all the way to his own door, being greatly di&s;&s;atisfied at the con|duct of the ju&s;tice in the whole tran&s;ac|tion.</P>
<P>The moment he got into his &s;tudy, he walked about the room with great agitation, cur&s;ing, &s;inging, and crying, by turns; then tore his wig, and, throw|ing it on the floor, &s;tamped upon it with great violence; then run his head again&s;t the wall, and began to caper about the place in &s;uch a manner that I had not the lea&s;t doubt remaining of his brain being di&s;ordered; &s;o, &s;tealing out of the room, I locked the door on the out&s;ide, re&s;olving not to venture into the room by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>After &s;itting by the kitchen-fire for about a quarter of an hour, the hou&s;e|keeper

(who had been out to procure &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries for the family) coming in, I told her the &s;tory, which terrified her almo&s;t as much as my&s;elf.

When we unlocked the door of the doctor's &s;tudy, I found him with his head upon the table, fa&s;t a&s;leep, and &s;noring comfortably without his wig.&mdash; Mr. Rhubarb expre&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow at &s;eeing his friend and patron &s;o mal|treated, and in &s;o comfortle&s;s a &s;itua|tion; but, de&s;iring the hou&s;ekeeper to bring his woollen night-cap, the offi|cious apothecary tied it under his chin, and advi&s;ed us to conduct him to bed; which endeavouring to put in execution, the doctor awoke, and, perceiving his

friend and coun&s;ellor, Mr. Rhubarb, he embraced him &s;eemingly with great affection; at the &s;ame time the tears ran down his cheeks &s;o copiou&s;ly that my heart melted within me.

At the in&s;tigation of Rhubarb, he permitted us to convey him to his bed-chamber, and there, while he was &s;itting on the edge of the bed undre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, he amu&s;ed us with a di&s;&s;ertation on the perver&s;ion of the di&s;tinction of right and wrong, and the glaring folly of the legi&s;lature in appointing individuals to be magi|&s;trates, who&s;e educations are narrow and who&s;e principles are vulnerable; and,

to do him ju&s;tice, he handled the &s;ub|ject with a degree of ingenuity and knowledge, that &s;ufficiently proved him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a keen and &s;trong under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Now we left him to enjoy a com|fortable night's re&s;t, of which, indeed, he had great occa&s;ion, not only to re|cruit his &s;pirits, but his &s;trength, to en|counter a &s;eries of unnumbered cala|mities, which the flinty-hearted de&s;ti|nies had decreed &s;hould torment him on the following day.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Large party of Highlanders arriving in the town, on their way from Dublin to Cork, and &s;ome of the offi|cers &s;pending the evening at the inn with the gentlemen of the place, a
<PB N="135" REF="146">
thought came into the head of a plea|&s;ant fellow, who was one of the party, to put another trick upon Calomel, which, if it &s;ucceeded, and was carried on properly, would effectually reduce him &s;o far that he would never be able to hold his head up again, or mortify him to that degree as to oblige him to quit the town; a circum&s;tance mo&s;t ar|dently wi&s;hed for by a majority of the inhabitants, to whom he had made him|&s;elf exceedingly obnoxious.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme was built upon the doc|tor's frequent boa&s;ting in company, that, when he was at Gla&s;gow, pro&s;e|cuting his medical &s;tudies, he was &s;ig|nalized and honoured for his peculiar indu&s;try and penetration, and that one of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians of that country, a Dr. Macgreggor, kept up a
<PB N="136" REF="147">
con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with him ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Now it was re&s;olved, that a Captain Crazy, a determined enemy of the doctor's, and one of the party, &s;hould dre&s;s him&s;elf in a Highland plaid, and, being an excellent mimic, &s;hould pa&s;s for the &s;urgeon of the regiment, and nephew to the Scotch phy&s;ician in que&s;|tion;&mdash;and that he &s;hould &s;end his com|pliments to Dr. Calomel, and acquaint him, that he would do him&s;elf the ho|nour of paying his re&s;pects to him be|fore he left the town. Accordingly the card was written, and a man di&s;patched with it to his hou&s;e. In the mean while Crazy, and another of the party, put on the Highland uniform, and, agree|ably to promi&s;e, after di&s;gui&s;ing their faces, went to Calomel's, and knocked
<PB N="137" REF="148">
at the door. The doctor, on any other occa&s;ion, would have been proud to have received &s;uch a mark of re&s;pect from the nephew of &s;o great a man; but, circum&s;tanced as he was, at that time, with a mo&s;t tremendous black eye, he would mo&s;t willingly have de|clined the interview; however, they came in &s;o unawares, that they ab&s;o|lutely took the doctor by &s;urpri&s;e, who was then in the act of adju&s;ting him&s;elf to hide his di&s;grace as much as lay in his power. After the fir&s;t ceremonies were over, and Calomel had made the nece&s;&s;ary inquiries after the health of his friend Macgreggor, the pretended &s;urgeon a&s;ked him how he came by &s;o di&s;agreeable an accident as that of a black eye. The que&s;tion aba&s;hed the doctor at fir&s;t; but, a&s;&s;uming an air of
<PB N="138" REF="149">
indifference, and a &s;pirit of lying being among the re&s;t of his qualifications, he told them, that, having occa&s;ion to get up in the night, in attempting to go down &s;tairs his foot &s;lipped, and he fell from the top to the bottom, and &s;truck his eye again&s;t a &s;tool, which his &s;er|vant had carele&s;sly left there after wind|ing up the clock, which &s;tood at the bottom of the &s;tairs. They pitied his ca&s;e, and, to all appearance, &s;wallowed the doctor's circum&s;tantial lie with great credulity. Upon the pretended &s;ur|geon's begging leave to look at it, Ca|lomel complied with a great deal of un|willingne&s;s; and, upon the parties go|ing to the window to examine it, the &s;urgeon took care, while he was feeling the &s;welling, which was prodigiou&s;ly large and inflamed, to give him &s;uch
<PB N="139" REF="150">
pinches, and handled the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o roughly, that Calomel, in &s;pite of all his endeavours to the contrary, could not help wincing, and grinding his teeth with torture; till, at la&s;t, the pretended nephew of Macgreggor gave him &s;uch a confounded pinch, that the doctor, lo&s;ing all patience, bellowed like a &s;tuck pig; exclaiming, with great vocifera|tion, that he could not endure more pain in an amputation; upon which the other a&s;king pardon, the doctor appear|ed perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>After &s;ome de&s;ultory di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;tate of phy&s;ic in Scotland, a &s;ubject which the doctor's vi&s;itor avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible, they parted, but not before the phy&s;ician had made a pro|mi&s;e to &s;pend the evening at the inn: when Calomel &s;tarted &s;ome objections
<PB N="140" REF="151">
relative to his eye, the other a&s;&s;ured him, upon his honour, that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of curing it in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle night, and that he would do him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of re|moving &s;o ungentlemanlike and per|plexing a disfigurement that very eve|ning; for which kind and polite in|tention Calomel profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very happy.</P>
<P>At the appointed hour for meeting in the evening, the doctor's newly-acquired friends, accompanied with two or three more implacable foes to Calomel, pro|perly di&s;gui&s;ed, and a few Scotch offi|cers, a&s;&s;embled together, expecting the phy&s;ician every minute.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t inform my readers, that my ma&s;ter was &s;o elevated with the idea of his own con&s;equence, which he concei|ved
<PB N="141" REF="152">
to be greatly heightened by the late vi&s;it, that he made a point to go among his acquaintance, and publi&s;h the cir|cum&s;tance as a matter materially re|&s;ounding to his per&s;onal honour and cha|racter; he &s;et forth the re&s;pect that was entertained for his abilities in other countries, and, at the &s;ame time, hint|ed how much the people of P&mdash;n were indebted to him for re&s;iding among them.</P>
<P>The time arriving that he was to re|pair to the inn, he put on his be&s;t wig, nicely powdered for the occa&s;ion, and curled as clo&s;e as a cauliflower; and, getting into a chair, he proceeded to the rendezvous with a heart as light as pride and vanity could make it. When he entered the room, the gentlemen ro&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking the
<PB N="142" REF="153">
chair at the upper end of the table, which, with a little affectation of mo|de&s;ty, he accepted. After a dozen gla&s;&s;es had circulated bri&s;kly, the doc|tor's unbound eye began to twinkle; and not intirely without a cau&s;e; for the&s;e wags had &s;lily infu&s;ed a quantity of brandy into every gla&s;s of wine the doctor drank; while he, proud of exhi|biting his talents for di&s;putation, was holding forth to the re&s;t of the company, and explaining, with great energy, the origin and exertion of the mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, conceiving a di&s;reli&s;h for the wine, a large bowl of punch was or|dered, which they placed before Calo|mel, who, bending over the bowl, lo&s;t his equilibrium, and, falling along the table, was, with &s;ome difficulty, replaced in his chair by his comic companions;
<PB N="143" REF="154">
but not without di&s;ordering his wig in &s;uch a manner that it was impo&s;&s;ible he could put it on his head any more that evening; for the truth is, when the doc|tor fir&s;t lo&s;t the center of gravity, in plunging forward, his nicely-dre&s;&s;ed wig fell into the punch-bowl, where it was &s;wimming for a period of five minutes, while they were fixing the phy&s;ician in his pre&s;idential chair; but, the doctor complaining that his head was cold, they called for a red night-cap, which the landlord brought, and with that they protected his &s;eat of knowledge and me|dical &s;kill from the a&s;&s;aults of the cold air.</P>
<P>It was now propo&s;ed by the fictitious &s;urgeon to apply the remedy to the doc|tor's eye, which he a&s;&s;enting to by a nod, being intirely overcome with li|quor,
<PB N="144" REF="155">
they tipped the landlord a wink, who went out, and returned in a few minutes with a plate-full of guts, taken warm from a &s;heep that was ju&s;t killed, which putting in a coar&s;e cloth, they applied, &s;moking hot, to the maimed eye and cheek of the pa&s;&s;ive doctor, who, having fallen into a &s;ound &s;leep, lay &s;noring in his chair, drunk, and in|&s;en&s;ible to all their kind exertions for the re&s;toration of his health.</P>
<P>After having tied on this never-failing pla&s;ter for his recovery, which, mode|rately &s;peaking, covered three-fourths of his head, and enjoying the brilliant &s;ucce&s;s of their de&s;ign for &s;ome time, they order|ed a chair, and, putting the phy&s;ician in|to it, &s;ent him home dead drunk, with his wig dropping wet in his lap before him. The chairmen (who had been previou&s;ly
<PB N="145" REF="156">

The chairmen, being almo&s;t as drunk as their employer, and not percei|ving his di&s;a&s;ter, got up, and made the be&s;t of their way to the doctor's hou&s;e. Hearing the chair &s;top, I ran with the light; but, gue&s;s our &s;urprize when we found the vehicle unoccupied! &mdash; The chairmen were thunder&s;truck; and all the hou&s;ekeeper and I could get out of them was, that they were certain the doctor got into the &s;edan at the inn.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="157">In the mid&s;t of concern for our ma&s;|ter's &s;afety, it was determined that I &s;hould go to Mr. Rhubarb, and endea|vour, with him, to di&s;cover what had become of the doctor. Accordingly, I went and called Mr. Rhubarb, who, imagining it was a &s;ummons to attend &s;ome per&s;on that had been taken &s;ick in the night, jumped up, and, dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with uncommon alacrity, inqui|red who was unwell; but, &s;eeing me, and under&s;tanding that the doctor was mi&s;&s;ing, he appeared very much alarm|ed, and, taking hat, cloak, and &s;tick, we &s;allied forth in que&s;t of this medical child of innumerable misfortunes. After rambling about the town for above half an hour, to no purpo&s;e, and wet to the &s;kin, (for it rained extremely hard,) we re&s;olved to give over the pur&s;uit; but,
<PB N="147" REF="158">
on turning the corner of the market-place, we heard a noi&s;e, much re&s;em|bling that of a man groaning, and, go|ing up to inquire the cau&s;e, there we found the pitiable Calomel (for, by this time, the wet and cold he had &s;u&s;tained awaked him) groping in the &s;urrounding mud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and he was &s;o disfi|gured, that, had it not been for his voice, we never &s;hould have recognized his per&s;on.</P>
<P>After getting him upon his legs, Rhu|barb called up a poor woman, who li|ved hard by the place, and, when &s;he had &s;truck a light, we guided this mi|&s;erable di&s;ciple of Hippocrates into the hou&s;e. When Mr. Rhubarb fir&s;t &s;aw his head, he bur&s;t into an exclamation of "Ch&mdash;t J&mdash;s! what have we here! &s;ure, this is not the doctor!"&mdash;"Yes,

but it is though, you &s;neaking cly&s;|ter-pipe &s;on of a whore," cries Ca|lomel, at the &s;ame time belching mo&s;t immoderately, "if it isn't me, who is it? tell me that;&mdash;d'ye hear?"&mdash; I beg your pardon, doctor," cries Rhubarb, "I did not mean to give you offence, upon my honour."&mdash;You and your honour may be damned to|gether;&mdash;d'ye hear me now?&mdash;here's a pretty &s;cou&mdash;ou&mdash;ou&mdash;ndrel to be talking of honour, that &s;ells the pow|der of rotten wood for julep, and ground oi&s;ter-&s;hells for <HI>magne&s;ia al|ba.</HI>"&mdash;"I &s;corn your words," replied the other.&mdash;"You and your &s;corn may go to the devil together;" &s;aid the doctor;&mdash;"d'ye hear me now, you dried eel-&s;kin? &mdash; Here, hou&s;e, bring me &s;ome brandy, for I'm cur&s;ed dry."</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="160">The apothecary and I &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;hment at each other, and could &s;carce believe we were in our &s;en&s;es; but, perceiving his head tied up, and the wildne&s;s of his eye and di&s;cour&s;e co-operating with our fears, we took it for granted, that, by &s;ome &s;hocking ac|cident the &s;cull was fractured, and that the <HI>&s;en&s;orium</HI> was wounded by the con|tu&s;ion; however, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the old woman of the hou&s;e, we made him three quarts of whey, which forcing down his throat, we perceived his rea&s;on to return apace.</P>
<P>When he came a little to him&s;elf, Rhubarb ventured to inquire what was the cau&s;e of his head being bound up in &s;o extraordinary a manner. All we could gather from his an&s;wer was, that it was put on by Dr. Macgreggor.&mdash;

<P>By this time, the copious draughts of whey that he had drunk, mixing with the vile dregs of the &s;pirituous liquor in his &s;tomach, cau&s;ed an in&s;urrection in that &s;en&s;ible part of the frame that put a total &s;top to Calomel's eulogium on his friend Macgreggor; and, after turn|ing up the white of his eye, with great energy, his face appeared as agitated by &s;trong convul&s;ions, which la&s;ted until nature, harra&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a combina|tion of liquids, impelled the phy&s;ician to di&s;charge the nau&s;eating load; which, lighting on the neck of the old woman,

(who was &s;tooping to re-kindle her fire,) ran down her back and &s;houlders like a torrent, and made her &s;tink more of|fen&s;ive than a bog-hou&s;e in the dog-days. Rhubarb all the while kept &s;lap|ping his patron on the back, who, gi|ving a violent &s;train to bring up the la&s;t remains of the filthy cargo, bur&s;t the bandage which tied the pla&s;ter to his eye; when the guts and garbage, falling to the ground, fairly &s;uffocated a young kitten that was fa&s;t a&s;leep at the doctor's feet.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The doctor pa&s;&s;es a night of great unea&s;i|ne&s;s.&mdash;Seeks his per&s;ecutor in the morn|ing.&mdash;Is guilty of a &s;mall mi&s;take, which throws him into a paroxy&s;m of de&s;pair.&mdash; Receives a threatening letter.&mdash;To avoid public &s;hame, he retires to a relation's, and I am di&s;charged from his &s;ervice.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the doctor and his friend Rhubarb pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night at the old woman's cabin, that they might not fail to find out Dr. Macgreggor in the morning, (which, if they went to bed, they apprehended might be the ca&s;e, as the Highlanders were ordered to a&s;&s;emble in the morning early at the market-place, for the pur|po&s;e

of proceeding on their route to Cork,) I was di&s;patched home to bring a change of clothes and linen, that my ma&s;ter might be properly dre&s;&s;ed, to call his brother in phy&s;ical iniquity to a pro|per account for the affront he had re|ceived at his hands over-night. On my return, we u&s;ed every expedient to ar|ray him properly; &mdash; we &s;tripped the doctor &s;tark naked, and wa&s;hed him with buckets of water from head to foot; and, after rubbing him dry, by frequently giving him whey and butter-milk recovered him pretty tolerably; &s;o that, when Aurora thought proper to give birth to a new day, the phy&s;ician had almo&s;t totally &s;urmounted his late indi&s;po&s;ition, and, con&s;idering every thing, cut a better figure, as a human being, than could well have been ex|pected
<PB N="154" REF="165">
from the variety of mi&s;ery he had &s;o recently experienced.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we heard the drums of the Highland regiment beating a reveilly, to call the &s;oldiers to a&s;&s;emble, the pu|rified doctor began to breathe nothing but denunciations of vengeance again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed nephew of the celebrated Dr. Macgreggor; he &s;wore, with great bitterne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, that no con&s;i|deration whatever &s;hould re&s;train him from publicly cha&s;ti&s;ing the object of his wrath.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely fini&s;hed this mena|cing and terrific prologue to the ap|proaching farce, when the old woman (whom he had di&s;patched to the mar|ket-place for the purpo&s;e of bringing the earlie&s;t account of their mu&s;tering) returned, to inform my ma&s;ter that the
<PB N="155" REF="166">
Scotchmen had already formed their ranks, with every man his knap&s;ack, and appeared equipped, at all points, for an immediate departure.</P>
<P>This information rouzed the mal|treated Calomel, who, attended by his faithful ally, Mr. Rhubarb, and my&s;elf, &s;allied forth to the propo&s;ed &s;cene of action. My ma&s;ter hurried on with pro|digious ha&s;te until we came within fifty paces of the market-place, when his walking became &s;lower and &s;lower; and it was evident, by the livid palene&s;s of his countenance and the quivering of his lips, that he &s;orely repented of his ra&s;hne&s;s. When he came within &s;ight of the &s;oldiers, he &s;uddenly turned about, and addre&s;&s;ed his friend Rhubarb in the following manner, his knees trembling under him all the while:&mdash;"Don't you
<PB N="156" REF="167">
think now, Mr. Rhubarb, that this action of mine favours &s;trongly of a bloody and de&s;perate di&s;po&s;ition? If it come to a duel, I know I &s;hall certainly kill him, and you mu&s;t be convinced that is but little &s;hort of murder;&mdash;no, I know my own ra&s;h|ne&s;s;" &s;ays he, with trembling ac|cents;&mdash;"it is an unchri&s;tianlike deed to &s;eek revenge, and I'll go no far|ther." &mdash;"What!" &s;ays Rhubarb, &s;hocked at his want of &s;pirit, "will you permit &s;uch an outrage, committed on your per&s;on, to go unpuni&s;hed!&mdash; Oh! fie, doctor!&mdash;it mu&s;t not be!" &s;ays Rhubarb; at the &s;ame time giving him a &s;hove with his &s;houlder, which drove the petrified phy&s;ician three yards nearer to the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="168">My ma&s;ter, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to retreat with honour, as things had been already carried &s;o far, made the be&s;t of the embarra&s;&s;ment, and, a&s;&s;uming all the importance he was able, walked up to the commanding officer, (&s;haking all the way, like a man in a pal&s;y,) and, putting his cane to his no&s;e, a&s;ked for Dr. Macgreggor in as authoritative a tone as he po&s;&s;ibly could a&s;&s;ume. The officer, perceiving that he was not treated with all that re&s;pect which he conceived to be his due, looked down upon this har|binger of death with ineffable contempt, at the &s;ame time remaining &s;ilent; but, upon the doctor's repeating the que&s;|tion, a young en&s;ign, who &s;tood at his elbow, told him there was no &s;uch man in the regiment. Calomel replied, that was impo&s;&s;ible; for he had invited him,
<PB N="158" REF="169">
in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> but the day before, and had likewi&s;e &s;pent the evening in his company at the inn, with &s;ix officers belonging to the corps; and had recei|ved &s;uch ungentlemanlike u&s;age, that he demanded &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Here the commanding officer, per|ceiving the mi&s;take, a&s;&s;ured him, upon his honour, there was no &s;uch per&s;on belonging to the regiment. The phy|&s;ician was thunder&s;truck; but, ob&s;er|ving the ma&s;ter of the inn at a di&s;tance, he beckoned him to him, and a&s;ked him, before a whole circle of people, (who had, by this time, gathered round the doctor,) if he knew who it was he was in company with, the evening before, at his hou&s;e.&mdash;The innkeeper replied, perfectly well;&mdash;that they were a parcel of gentlemen of the town, who had
<PB N="159" REF="170">
dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, for the &s;ake of a frolic, in the Highland uniform.&mdash;The doctor ha&s;tily inquired, who it was that called for the wine; and, hearing it was Mr. M'Neil, he appeared thoughtful for a few &s;econds; and, recollecting his features, and the &s;ucce&s;sful effect of their &s;tratagem, at his expence, together with the ridiculous boa&s;tings he had made of the honour of &s;uch a connexion, the blood for&s;ook his cheeks, and he ab&s;o|lutely fainted away in the arms of the apothecary, being completely overcome by a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, grief, and mortification.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate he was conveyed home before he recovered the u&s;e of his fa|culties, which he no &s;ooner found him|&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of than he tore his hair, and beat his brea&s;t with uncommon vio|lence;
<PB N="160" REF="171">
and, with the tears trickling down his face, he kneeled upon the ground, and, with the mo&s;t infernal execrations, cur&s;ed him&s;elf and the womb that brought him forth; at the &s;ame time vowing an eternal enmity with all man|kind.</P>
<P>The perturbation of his mind was &s;o great, that not only Rhubarb, but the hou&s;ekeeper and my&s;elf, expected no|thing le&s;s, from &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive agita|tions, but an in&s;tantaneous deprivation of his &s;en&s;es. His friend declaring him in a high fever, he was put to bed, which he kept for a fortnight, refu&s;ing to take any kind of &s;u&s;tenance or re|fre&s;hment for the fir&s;t three days.</P>
<P>When he had pretty well overcome the dreadful effects of the malady, he received one morning (while he was
<PB N="161" REF="172">

<PB N="167" REF="178">
Mr. Rhubarb for his friend&s;hip, I de|parted, with my linen, and all the port|able part of my wardrobe, tied up in a handkerchief, which putting at the end of a crab-&s;tick, I threw them acro&s;s my &s;houlder, and bade adieu to P&mdash;n for ever.</P>
<P>Taking the road to Dublin, I had travelled on &s;omewhat better than &s;even miles when I began to find my&s;elf in want of refre&s;hment; and, &s;topping at a &s;mall town, I went into a little mean-looking public-hou&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by a mi&s;erable &s;ign, which the arti&s;t meant &s;hould be taken for the ve|nerable figure of St. Patrick, in the act of driving all venomous reptiles out of the Land of Saints.</P>
<P>On my entering, I found the whole family had ju&s;t &s;at down to dinner, and
<PB N="168" REF="179">
hunger, at that time, being the great|e&s;t of the evils I endured, I re&s;olved to take advantage of my good fortune, and remove it; &s;o, boldly marching in, I told the landlord, if it were agreeable I would make one among them; offer|ing, at the &s;ame time, to pay whatever he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary. He gladly accepted my offer, and one and all &s;eemed to &s;trive who &s;hould be foremo&s;t to accommodate the young &s;tranger; &s;o, taking my place by a lu&s;ty black-eyed wench, (whom I afterwards found to be the landlord's elde&s;t daughter,) I began to a&s;&s;ail the whole&s;ome dainties of the table, which con&s;i&s;ted of a piece of &s;alt pork, boiled, &mdash; &s;ome red herrings, &mdash; a profu&s;ion of potatoes,&mdash;and &s;ome grid|dle-bread: and indeed it was extremely fortunate that I was &s;o &s;harp &s;et; for,
<PB N="169" REF="180">
while I was ca&s;ting an eye of admira|tion towards the ro&s;y wench that &s;at at my right hand, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e had filled my plate &s;o full of the be&s;t of every thing at the table, that it formed a kind of pyramid, behind which I &s;at intrenched, and lo&s;t in a kind of a&s;to|ni&s;hment; which is not &s;o much to be wondered at, as I had &s;o recently left the oeconomic table of Dr. Calomel, who would not willingly have allowed me &s;o much victuals for a week's &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence as this poor man de&s;igned &s;hould be only a part of one meal.</P>
<P>After I had allayed the cravings of my appetite, which, at the fir&s;t en|counter, bordered a little on the vora|cious, I had time and opportunity to &s;urvey the re&s;t of the family.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="181">Be&s;ides the ho&s;t, who was a hearty, facetious, man, and his buxom daughter, we had the company of his wife, who did the honours of her table, if it may be allowed that the fulfilling them con&s;i&s;ts in making every one a|round her eat plentifully; for my part, &s;he &s;o teazed me with her importunities to devour more than I was able, that I longed mo&s;t ardently for a removal of the victuals, to get rid of the trouble|&s;ome effects of her well-meant ho&s;pita|lity.</P>
<P>On the ground, at one corner of the apartment, were three fubby ma&s;culine children, the elde&s;t not more than &s;ix years old, as naked as when they came out of their mother's womb, &s;urround|ing a large wooden di&s;h, full of pota|toes, out of which they were eating
<PB N="171" REF="182">
lu&s;tily, accompanied by the like num|ber of pigs, who, by their noi&s;e in eat|ing, formed a kind of concert; the grunting of the pigs &s;erving as a kind of ba&s;s, which accorded perfectly well with the treble and tenor &s;qualling of the children. After the &s;wine had fi|ni&s;hed their repa&s;t, they ranged about the room with that kind of confidence and dumb plea&s;ure, which clearly pro|ved to me, that they did not con&s;ider them&s;elves, by any means, as incon&s;i|derable members of the family.</P>
<P>When I had &s;atisfied the landlord for my refre&s;hment, I once more renewed my pede&s;trian expedition, &s;till keeping on the high road to the metropolis. As I walked fa&s;t, I overtook a pedlar, and joined company with him. After a few que&s;tions had pa&s;&s;ed, on both &s;ides, he
<PB N="172" REF="183">
informed me that he was going to Dub|lin likewi&s;e, to procure a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ort|ment of goods; but, that being the time of the <HI>curragh</HI> meeting, he propo|&s;ed to &s;top that evening at Kildare, which re&s;olution he advi&s;ed me to concur in, as the evening was approaching very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>I thought his determination &s;o pro|per, and moreover liking his company, that I in&s;tantly agreed, and on we jogged together, the pedlar beguiling both the time and the road by recapitulating his adventures. In the cour&s;e of his remarks, he did not fail to warn me again&s;t the impo&s;itions of the world, and recounted various in&s;tances of youth coming to a bad and an untimely end, by making choice, in the early part of their lives, of vicious and unprincipled companions.
<PB N="173" REF="184">
I was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his di&s;cour&s;e that I li&s;tened to him with very great attention, and &s;ecretly ble&s;&s;ed my&s;elf for being &s;o uncommonly fortunate as to meet with &s;o good and &s;o exemplary an a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>While I was attending to the &s;age injunctions of this itinerant Mentor, we imperceptibly arrived at Kildare. I was &s;o much attached to my companion, that I reque&s;ted him, as a particular favour, that he would permit me to me&s;s and &s;leep with him until we reached Dub|lin; to which, after &s;ome little he&s;ita|tion, he a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>We put up at the &s;ign of the <HI>Brogue</HI> and <HI>Shamrock;</HI> and, having &s;ecured our bed, for the u&s;e of which, for one night, we agreed to pay four-pence, my com|panion (who&s;e name I now under&s;tood

We pa&s;&s;ed away the time in di&s;cour&s;ing on various topics, in which my friend Blarney never failed to introduce &s;ome excellent le&s;&s;on of morality.&mdash;We regaled our&s;elves at intervals with eating bread and chee&s;e, and wa&s;hing it down with copious draughts of ale, brewed by our land|lady, as thick as water-gruel, and as &s;our as a crab-apple.</P>
<P>When we &s;ignified a de&s;ire of going to bed, the ho&s;te&s;s &s;tepped forward, and, extending her hand, informed me that our reckoning came to tenpence-half-penny;
<PB N="175" REF="186">
when my friend Blarney, &s;eeing me put my hand in my pocket and pull out my money to di&s;charge it, im|mediately &s;topped me, and, paying the reckoning him&s;elf, told me, that young people, like me, had enough to do with their money be&s;ides treating their fel|low-travellers.&mdash;I was &s;o &s;truck with this in&s;tance of di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity, in &s;uch a man, that I could have hug|ged him with tran&s;ports of gratitude and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The good woman now &s;hewed us to our bed, to which we a&s;cended by the help of an old ladder;&mdash;it was placed in a kind of loft, in which we were for|ced to bend double, the rafters of the cieling and the floor being within three feet of each other.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="187">After our landlady had &s;trictly char|ged us to take care of our light, which was a dried ru&s;h, dipped in grea&s;e, &s;he left us to our private meditations. The dreary appearance around me made me undre&s;s my&s;elf and get into bed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; which my moral friend Blarney perceiving rebuked me, in very &s;evere terms, for lying down to re&s;t without fir&s;t returning thanks for the ble&s;&s;ings and comforts I had enjoyed through the day. I was &s;o confounded and a&s;hamed, that, although it was a cold night, I got out of bed, and, kneel|ing by the &s;ide of Blarney, he made me repeat &s;uch a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prayers, that every joint trembled with cold. At la&s;t, thinking proper to end his devo|tions, we got into bed, and, bein very
<PB N="177" REF="188">
much fatigued with travelling &s;o many miles, I in&s;tantly fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>But how great was my &s;urprize when I awoke in the morning and found my partner gone! however, concluding that he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act in the town, and that, when he had performed it, he would return and call me, I re|mained perfectly &s;atisfied, and in&s;en&s;ibly fell into another doze; from which I was rouzed by the woman of the hou&s;e, who a&s;ked me, in a very rough manner, if I meant to &s;leep all day as well as all night; upon which I a&s;ked her what time of the morning it was;&mdash;"Time," &s;ays &s;he, "why, it's time to go to din|ner!" At which I was &s;o &s;tartled that I got up and dre&s;&s;ed, my&s;elf in a few minutes, and, de&s;cending the ladder, inquired if &s;he had &s;een my bedfellow
<PB N="178" REF="189">
that morning;&mdash;"Seen him!" &s;ays &s;he, no, no; Dennis Blarney knows bet|ter than to be &s;een in Kildare by day|light; I warrant him that he's a good ten mile of the road by this time!" When I inquired into the meaning of her &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;he told me, that he was as big a villain as was unhanged, and had actually been tried, at the a&s;|&s;izes in that town, on a &s;u&s;picion of burglary.</P>
<P>On hearing this account, which I be|lieved as neither more nor le&s;s than a downright fal&s;ehood, I told the woman that certainly &s;he was deceived; for I was convinced, by his behaviour, that he was not only an hone&s;t, but a reli|gious, man: at which my landlady bur&s;t into a loud laugh, and a&s;ked me how long I had been acquainted with him;
<PB N="179" REF="190">
on my replying, only about three hours before I entered her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, that was long enough in all con&s;cience; and bade me, as I valued my character, if ever I met Blarney again to &s;hun him as I would a third-day ague.</P>
<P>My &s;tomach being, by this time, ready for the reception of another meal, I ordered &s;ome eggs to be boiled, and demoli&s;hed nine in as many &s;econds, which, le&s;t they &s;hould lie heavy, I qua|lified with a quart of ale; and, inqui|ring how much they came to, was pre|paring to di&s;charge the obligation, when, lo! I put my hand in my pocket, and found my money had fled!&mdash;I &s;earched one pocket after another, with the ut|mo&s;t trepidation; but, alas! all to no purpo&s;e. My landlady, perceiving my tribulation, inquired the cau&s;e; and,
<PB N="180" REF="191">
when I informed her that I had lo&s;t my money, &s;he a&s;ked what opinion I had of hone&s;t Dennis Blarney now; who, it &s;eems, notwith&s;tanding all his mora|lity and religion, had thought proper to march off not only with my money, but likewi&s;e with two &s;hirts, three pair of &s;tockings, and a linen wai&s;tcoat, which I had tied up in a handkerchief, and left in the room when I went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>I was &s;o affected at fir&s;t with my lo&s;s that I wept bitterly, being left in a &s;trange place, totally de&s;titute of friends, and not a penny in my pocket to pro|cure me food. The poor woman, at who&s;e hou&s;e I had lodged, took com|panion on my di&s;tre&s;s, and told me that I was extremely welcome to what I owed her&s;elf; but advi&s;ed me, while I lived, not to be over-ready in giving credit to
<PB N="181" REF="192">
the profe&s;&s;ions of men, that I did not know at fir&s;t, for the future. With this whole&s;ome admonition in my head, and abundance of &s;orrow in my heart, I went forth from her hou&s;e, with a con|&s;iderable addition to my experience, and not a penny in my pocket.</P>
<P>After &s;auntering about the place a great part of the day, I chanced to pa&s;s by a gate-way, intirely wrapt up in con|templation on the melancholy &s;tate of my finances, when a noi&s;e, all on a &s;ud|den, a&s;&s;ailed me, &s;o loud, &s;hrill, and di&s;cordant, that I verily believed it had bur&s;t the drum of my ear. After in|&s;tinctively clapping my hands to my head, to feel if it had not received &s;ome alteration from the violent nature of the a&s;&s;ault, I turned about, and &s;aw a fel|low in a livery-coat, &s;triped wai&s;tcoat,

red breeches, and an old gold-laced hat, in the act of blowing a trumpet. This prodigious exertion (which, in|deed, was not thrown away, for he made the very element re&s;ound with the a|larm) &s;welled his cheeks to the re&s;em|blance of bladders overcharged with wind.</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed this melodious flouri&s;h, (which had drawn together a large auditory of men, women, and children,) he changed the mode of en|tertainment, and proceeded to give a verbal de&s;cription of the wonderful &s;ights that were brought to the town, for the mere purpo&s;e of contributing to their amu&s;ement. He conveyed his lively de&s;criptions in a voice, that, had I been blind, I never &s;hould imagine could have i&s;&s;ued from human organs;&mdash;he

&s;eemed to heave every &s;entence from his lungs with prodigious difficulty, and with &s;uch a terrible hoar&s;ene&s;s of accent as rendered the plea&s;ant &s;allies of his imagination almo&s;t unintelligible.&mdash; "This is the time, my noble ma&s;ters," roared this herald of wonders, to &s;ee the large&s;t white bear, d'ye &s;ee, that ever was brought from the &s;hores of Greenland!&mdash;its body is as large as a young elephant, and every claw as thick as my leg!&mdash;Moreover, be&s;ides that, we have brought a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ing baboon, as tall, when he &s;tands upright, d'ye &s;ee, as e'er a trooper in the Ligonier hor&s;e!&mdash;and, for the plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction of my no|ble ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, d'ye &s;ee, the bear and the baboon &s;hall dance the minivit <HI>dilly core,</HI> &s;uch as was

<P>Having, by the &s;uperior eloquence of his harangue, drawn a young woman to the feet of &s;ome &s;teps that led to the &s;cene of wonders, he &s;uddenly clapped his &s;houlder to her bottom, (while &s;he &s;tood gazing, with her mouth wide open,) and, fairly lifting her up three &s;teps, be|gan to roar, <Q>See how they tumble up there! my hearts; now's your time, or never!</Q>&mdash;The young woman was &s;o confounded at her unexpected eleva|tion,

that, for fear of turning about, and expo&s;ing her&s;elf to the mirth of the mob, &s;he paid her money at the en|trance, and hurried in as fa&s;t as her legs could carry her; and the con&s;equences proved, that the fellow's ingenious ex|pedient, of forcing the young woman, in a manner, to become a &s;pectator a|gain&s;t her own con&s;ent, was well timed; for the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly began to a&s;cend &s;o fa&s;t, that, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, the room of exhibition was intire|ly crammed.</P>
<P>The fellow at the door &s;oliciting me to depo&s;it my two-pence for the &s;ight, among the re&s;t, with all the per&s;ua&s;ion he was ma&s;ter of, I ingenuou&s;ly told him, that two-pence, in coin, was, at that time, more than I was worth in the whole world. Upon his a&s;king if I had
<PB N="186" REF="197">
a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee the &s;how, and my replying in the affirmative, he bade me follow him, for that they were going to begin.</P>
<P>Elated with the opportunity of &s;eeing the dance for nothing, and highly plea|&s;ed with the good-natured offer of the man, I followed him into a dark pa&s;|&s;age, when, upon lifting up the &s;hat|tered remains of an old carpet, I found my&s;elf on a &s;udden behind the &s;cenes, but the place was &s;o dark that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h one object from another; nor &s;hould I have been able to have di&s;covered the &s;ituation of the audi|ence, if it had not been for the thun|dering clamour which they made for the &s;how-man to begin.</P>
<P>I was &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed in my new &s;itu|tion that I was afraid to &s;tir, for fear of
<PB N="187" REF="198">
doing &s;ome mi&s;chief, when, in the mid&s;t of a loud roar, which the &s;pectators &s;et up for the entertainments to commence, a fellow in the gallery, enraged at the delay, and perceiving me groping about the &s;tage, whom he mi&s;took for the &s;how-man him&s;elf, threw an apple with &s;uch force as, unluckily coming full in my left eye, made it actually &s;trike fire, and frightened me to that degree, that, attempting to make my e&s;cape, I ran directly again&s;t Ma&s;ter Bruin, who was &s;itting upon his hind legs, ready to be led out to dance by his agreeable part|ner, the baboon. The &s;trength with which I ran again&s;t the bear (who had not been u&s;ed to &s;uch intru&s;ions) of|fended him &s;o much, that, quickly turn|ing round, he &s;eized me in his paws, and, griping me with more violence
<PB N="188" REF="199">
than Hercules ever did Anteus, made me bawl out <HI>murder</HI> without intermi&s;&s;ion, until the keeper came with a light to my re&s;cue, and found me inclo&s;ed fa&s;t in the &s;haggy animal's embrace, while he was pummelling me over the head and face with his &s;nout, which, it was extremely lucky for me, was &s;ecurely muzzled, otherwi&s;e the angry brute had certainly made a breakfa&s;t on my brains.</P>
<P>When the keeper made him quit his prey, by dint of many hard blows, which he gave Bruin with a long pole that he kept for that purpo&s;e, I dropped motionle&s;s on the ground, and &s;ainted in a fit, out of which I was recovered, as I afterwards found, by an old wo|man, who poured a whole pail-full of water upon my face, which in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly

called me back to life; but the remedy was attended with one di&s;agree|able effect, which was, that it left me as wet as if I had been dipped in the river.</P>
<P>Upon my expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome apprehen|&s;ions of catching cold, the old woman de&s;ired me to go with her, and &s;he would bring me to a fire that I might dry my|&s;elf.

notion that, po&s;&s;ibly, his turn might be next, thought, like many an able gene|ral, that it was equally honourable, and infinitely &s;afer, to make a retreat from an enemy in time, whom he could not encounter without a certainty of lo&s;ing the battle; and, in pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, he made the be&s;t of his way to the top of the building, where he &s;at on a cro&s;s beam, grinning with a mi&s;|chievous and malignant a&s;pect upon his ma&s;ter, every now and then &s;cratching his rump, as if he meant to treat both him and his vengeance with &s;overeign contempt: however, the keeper, who had been pretty well accu&s;tomed to the unlucky pranks of this facetious young gentleman, procured a ladder and a hor&s;e-whip, and was a&s;cending to bring

his excentric pupil to a proper &s;en&s;e of his duty, when I went out with the old gentlewoman to dry my&s;elf by her fire.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Returned from drying my&s;elf ju&s;t in the nick of time, for the dance be|tween the bear and the baboon was then going to begin. I mu&s;t own my ex|pectations were exceedingly great, and I &s;urveyed the progre&s;s of the brutes
<PB N="193" REF="204">
with particular attention. When the baboon extended his paw to the bear, he &s;eemed to accept it with that &s;ullen kind of complai&s;ance, which made it appear rather a matter of force than in|clination; but, receiving from the &s;how-man, at that in&s;tant, a well-directed thump upon his po&s;teriors, it brought him to &s;uch a proper &s;en&s;e of decency and good manners, that he immediately proceeded to the front of the &s;tage with all the grace and agility of which he was ma&s;ter; when a little man, with one leg, and as blind as a mill-hor&s;e, who &s;at on a chair in the center of the plat|form, began to play the well-known and equally-celebrated tune of <HI>Sheela|na-gig</HI> upon an old violin that appear|ed to have received as much injury from the hand of time as him&s;elf; for, of the
<PB N="194" REF="205">
five &s;trings, (which the original inventor of the in&s;trument thought nece&s;&s;ary to the production of perfect harmony,) there were but two remaining. But this de|crepid Orpheus &s;eemed to think very lit|tle of &s;uch an impediment; for, labour|ing away with head, hands, and feet, he brought forth an infernal, grating, di&s;|tant, re&s;emblance of the tune in que&s;tion; indeed, had he performed ever &s;o well, it would have an&s;wered very little pur|po&s;e; for the &s;portive animals, either from want of a mu&s;ical ear, or &s;tubborn|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, paid &s;o little regard to the time or the tune, that it was pal|pable they jumped and &s;kipped about as di&s;orderly as if they had been both deaf to the elegant flouri&s;hes of the blind harmoni&s;t:&mdash;but, what they wanted in knowledge and attention, they amply
<PB N="195" REF="206">
made up in effect; for, during the per|formance, the laughter and applau&s;e that accompanied it was truly wonder|ful.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the dance, &s;ome of the more intelligent part of the audi|ence publicly complained to the &s;how-man, that the dance which they had &s;een was not the dance that they were promi&s;ed. The keeper replied, that he was &s;orry their complaint was, in one particular, but too well grounded; "for," &s;aid he, "I have been told as how, in dancing the minevit <HI>dilly core,</HI> they mu&s;t not turn their back|&s;ide on the audience; now, though I have beat the bear black and blue, as it were, my ma&s;ters, I could not, for the &s;oul of me, bring him to alter his manners, or to think otherwi&s;e
<PB N="196" REF="207">
than that his breech was, to the full, as honourable as any other part of his rough compo&s;ition."</P>
<P>The keeper's apology for Bruin's want of politene&s;s was received with great approbation, and he was de&s;ired to go on with the diver&s;ions.&mdash;<Q>Now, though the minevit might not be to your fancy altogether," &s;ays the &s;how-man, you &s;hall &s;ee a horn-pipe in &s;tyle, and, damme, I defy any of the great play|hou&s;es in London to &s;hew a better!&mdash; the bear &s;hall perform again&s;t any of 'em for a guinea, and I &s;ay <HI>done</HI> fir&s;t! why, it's no matter to me if they be|long (I'&s;e not afraid of my money) to Common-Garden, d'ye &s;ee, my ma&s;|ters, or the noted Flockton!</Q></P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this inimitable pa|negyric on his companion and fellow-traveller,
<PB N="197" REF="208">
the bear, he gave him a vio|lent thump on the head with a &s;tick, which, it &s;eems, was a &s;ignal for begin|ning, to which the animal had been &s;o well u&s;ed, that he immediately began to caper about the &s;tage in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner.</P>
<P>The poor &s;ightle&s;s fiddler was playing the tune of Nancy Daw&s;on with great eagerne&s;s, to accommodate his friend Bruin as well as he was able, when the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, not intirely &s;atisfied with his pupil's performance, lifted up his &s;tick to the &s;haggy actor in a threatening manner, which alarm|ed him &s;o much, (expecting the terrific motion to be followed by a blow,) that, in the endeavour to retreat from his fu|ry, he fell backwards over the maimed mu&s;ician, and &s;o cru&s;hed his weather-beaten
<PB N="198" REF="209">
carca&s;s with his ponderous weight, that it was greatly apprehended, by all pre&s;ent, that a &s;top was put to his gut-&s;craping talent for ever.</P>
<P>A few yards from the pro&s;trate vic|tim lay the remains of his once-famed violin, from who&s;e genial womb he had &s;o often called forth the fa&s;cinating &s;trains of melody, to beguile the lazy foot of time, and di&s;&s;ipate the impre&s;|&s;ions of care from the pea&s;ant's mind:&mdash; but, alas! it was decreed that it &s;hould yield delight no more; for it lay (par|ticipating the fate of its ma&s;ter) in a &s;tate of ruin, and &s;hattered into a hun|dred pieces.</P>
<P>The lamentable &s;ituation of the fallen &s;on of Apollo &s;eemed to awaken the &s;oft influence of &s;ympathy in every brea&s;t;&mdash; the keeper having &s;ecured the bear, e|very
<PB N="199" REF="210">
attention appeared now to center in the fiddler's cata&s;trophe. After rub|bing his temples with vinegar, for a few minutes, it was evident that he began to breathe, when a young &s;urgeon, who had mingled with the throng, offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>gratis,</HI> and recommended that he &s;hould be in&s;tantly bled, which operation he &s;et about performing with|out he&s;itation; and, having tied up his arm; he opened a vein, whence the blood flowed in &s;treams as thick and valuable as ever warmed the frame of an Iri&s;h king. The wi&s;er part of the company, fore&s;eeing that, if he continued to bleed in that manner for a &s;hort time longer, it mu&s;t inevitably deprive him of the little life that remained, propo&s;ed bind|ing up his arm, to which the &s;urgeon a&s;&s;ented; and he was conveyed to the
<PB N="200" REF="211">
next hou&s;e to receive &s;uch nouri&s;hment as the per&s;onal injuries he had &s;uffered made nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The alertne&s;s and activity, I had &s;hewn in attending upon the poor fiddler, had attracted the notice of the ma&s;ter of the &s;how; who, after the bu&s;ine&s;s was con|cluded, took occa&s;ion to a&s;k me &s;ome que&s;tions, as, who I was? &amp;c. intermix|ing his inquiries with &s;ome flattering compliments, &s;uch as, he believed I was a damned clever boy; and that, if I had a mind to go with him, I &s;hould live as merry as the day was long.</P>
<P>Surrounded as I was by di&s;tre&s;s, and entirely de&s;titute of a friend on whom I could, with any degree of certainty, re|ly for a &s;hilling, I thought I could not, in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, do better than clo&s;e with the bear-leader's pro|po&s;al;

&s;o, &s;triking his hand, with a hearty good will, which he held out for that purpo&s;e, he &s;hook it in &s;o cordial, and at the &s;ame time &s;o vigorous, a manner, that I thought at fir&s;t he had di&s;located my &s;houlder; but this friendly &s;alute, on the part of the &s;how-man, was con|&s;idered as a ratification of the treaty be|tween us, which was now, agreeably to the nature of &s;uch bargains, &s;igned and &s;ealed to all intents and purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>As my new ma&s;ter thought that he had gleaned the harve&s;t of the town pretty well, it was judged expedient, in a full council, compo&s;ed of him, the trumpeter, and my&s;elf, (for the poor fiddler remained &s;o ill, from the rough u&s;age of the bear, that we were forced to leave him behind,) to move our quarters with all convenient expedition;

&s;o, after &s;ecuring Ma&s;ter Bruin, (who, I was informed, was apt to be extreme|ly unruly, unle&s;s &s;uch a precaution was taken,) and tying up the baboon in a &s;ack, which was kept for that purpo&s;e, we depo&s;ited them, and the re&s;t of our portable furniture in a cart, and, at ex|actly half an hour after three the next morning, began our march, taking our route towards the northern part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>As we were tolerably well provided again&s;t the inconveniences of travelling &s;o early, (my ma&s;ter having wi&s;ely fur|ni&s;hed him&s;elf with a bottle of whi&s;key, and &s;ome bread baked on an iron grid|dle,) we proceeded as joyou&s;ly as we could wi&s;h, the trumpeter every now and then favouring us with a &s;ong, the burdens of which I do not think ne|ce&s;&s;ary

<P>In this care-killing di&s;po&s;ition did we pa&s;s along until we came to a little dirty hovel, by the road-&s;ide, which, by the number of cars that were ranged before the door, we pre&s;ently knew to be a kind of <HI>caravan&s;era,</HI> or rural <HI>hotel,</HI> where animals, of all de&s;criptions, might be entertained with bed and board, at all the hours of the day and night, for a very &s;mall con&s;ideration.

<P>When we made our entrance into the inn, (the &s;ides of which were built of mud, cemented with &s;traw, and formed a &s;ort of wall, about three feet in thick|ne&s;s, and covered with thatch, &s;o old and &s;o productive, that, in many places, it appeared more verdant than the ad|jacent

But, though it might, with great truth, be figuratively called the habitation of darkne&s;s, it was by no means the abode of &s;ilence; for a variety of voices i&s;&s;ued from every part of the place at the &s;ame time, that formed a kind of grating di&s;cord, which may be conceived by the imagi|nation, but is wholly unde&s;cribable by words.</P>
<P>Feeling my&s;elf very much chilled by the coldne&s;s of the morning air, I ven|tured
<PB N="206" REF="217">
to grope my way, as well as I could, to the place where I &s;aw the fire, but had not gone three &s;teps before I &s;tumbled, and, falling over a large warm body, which intercepted my pa&s;&s;age, I alighted on the other &s;ide in an in&s;tant, and unluckily pitched my head right into the face of a drover of cattle, who lay &s;noring upon his back, with his mouth open a foot wide. He no &s;ooner felt the unwelcome vi&s;it than he grap|pled me fa&s;t by the hair of my head, which he held mo&s;t tenaciou&s;ly, while he &s;truck me on the ribs with &s;uch fury, that I thought, in my terrors, he had actually drove them into my body, call|ing me a little dirty <HI>&s;palpeen</HI> &s;on of a whore. Though by no means equal in &s;trength to my adver&s;ary, I was &s;o en|raged at the &s;mart of the di&s;cipline I had

received, that I returned his favours with all the vigour I was able; and we lay &s;truggling together on the ground for &s;ome &s;econds, till a cow, (who, it appeared afterwards, was my a&s;&s;ailant's bedfellow,) being di&s;turbed by the af|fray, got up, turned her&s;elf about, and, lifting her tail, let fly without any &s;ort of ceremony, and ab&s;olutely deluged both him and me with the copiou&s;ne&s;s of her evacuation. On the receipt of this fre&s;h annoyance he quitted his hold, and I crept away, well plea&s;ed to e&s;cape the farther effects of his revenge, even in my pre&s;ent filthy condition.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the light I could ea&s;ily perceive that this public ho&s;|pitable receptacle was equally open for the accommodation of every kind of ani|mal, man included. In the center of the place was erected a kind of temporary manger, under which &s;ome hor&s;es were

extended in a &s;ound &s;leep; and, at their heads, their drivers were employed in the &s;ame &s;alutary pa&s;time, with their bo|dies parallel with the wall.</P>
<P>But what attracted my attention mo&s;t was the &s;ingular appearance of the lady, who had deigned, in conformity with the commands of her ma&s;ter, to illumi|nate the filthy hovel. Her per&s;on was rather of the &s;horte&s;t, being without her brogues, and be&s;ides, the lady ex|po&s;ed &s;omewhat too much of the <HI>rerum naturae</HI> for the eye of mode&s;ty, in height about four feet and an inch;&mdash;her figure &s;quare, &s;quab, and flabby;&mdash;and her hair (of which &s;he &s;eemed to have a prodigious quantity) was of the deepe&s;t tint of that obnoxious colour, vulgarly called <HI>car|roty,</HI> part of which hung in wanton ringlets down her &s;houlder, and the re|mainder
<PB N="214" REF="225">
appeared to be tied up as rough and &s;trong as a colt's mane, under the mi&s;erable remnants of a dirty piece of linen, which (&s;o indifferent was the fair Juggy in the ornaments of her beauteous per&s;on) &s;erved as a <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for a cap.&mdash;Her extremities bore all the marks of a vigorous, mu&s;cular, proportion; particularly her legs, which were coar&s;e, red, and &s;curfy, and had evidently a &s;trong inclination to be bandy, and the <HI>ga&s;terocnemii</HI> of which were as large and &s;inewy as tho&s;e of the Farne&s;e Hercu|les.&mdash;This delicate frame of the kind and officious nymph was &s;heltered from the rude winds, and more e&s;pecially from the roving eye of curious and unhallow|ed ob&s;ervers, by a kind of &s;mock, in the colour of which both black and white &s;eemed to contend for the &s;upe|riority;
<PB N="215" REF="226">
and the back of which (the only part I had the happine&s;s of &s;urvey|ing) reached ju&s;t as low down her body as where the mo&s;t &s;kilful anatomi&s;ts have thought proper to place the origin of the <HI>glutaeus;</HI> and from which &s;pot com|mences the formation of tho&s;e conve|nient, globular, bodies, in the neigh|bourhood of which the concurring de|terminations of the mo&s;t &s;agacious of mankind have placed the &s;en&s;ible &s;eat of per&s;onal honour.&mdash;I had ju&s;t time to take this cur&s;ory &s;urvey of her per&s;on, when the &s;pirit of delicacy impelled her to waddle towards the &s;traw, whence &s;he had ju&s;t ri&s;en, and there I left her, gather|ing up the tattered remains of her mot|ley drapery, to enable her to go through the duties and labour of the approach|ing day.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="227">As a kind of general di&s;turbance had taken place, and &s;ome of the drovers thought it time to get up, and pur&s;ue their &s;everal journies, a con&s;iderable number had a&s;&s;embled round the fire, among whom were my&s;elf, the &s;how-man, and the trumpeter. After &s;ome time employed in yawning, rubbing their eyes, and &s;hrugging their &s;houl|ders, it was propo&s;ed to &s;moke a whiff before they &s;et off; and, in con&s;equence, a &s;mall pipe was produced, broke off to the length of two inches, covered with an incru&s;tation of dirt, and, by the long cour&s;e of &s;ervice it had &s;een, as black as my hat. This was in&s;tantly filled with to|bacco, and, when properly lighted, was handed, as a te&s;timony of good fellow|&s;hip, round the company, who, each in his turn, took a bla&s;t for about five mi|nutes,
<PB N="217" REF="228">
and then, without ceremony, un|wiped, and reeking warm from the rot|ten teeth and gums of their a&s;&s;ociates, they partook, well plea&s;ed, refre&s;hing whiffs from the joy-in&s;piring weed.&mdash; When the pipe came round to me, it was with the utmo&s;t loathing of my &s;tomach that I accepted of the in&s;tru|ment of &s;ocial intercour&s;e; but, appre|hen&s;ive of appearing to di&s;like what all my companions &s;eemed to reli&s;h with &s;o high a gu&s;t, I re&s;olved to make a vir|tue of nece&s;&s;ity, and, taking the pipe, and putting it to my mouth with an intention of &s;moking, a more offen&s;ive &s;mell a&s;&s;ailed my no&s;e than could po&s;|&s;ibly have i&s;&s;ued from the celebrated box of Madam Pandora, which was reported to contain all that was &s;hocking and calamitous to human nature. Under
<PB N="218" REF="229">
the pretence of tobacco making me &s;ick, I was obliged to &s;hift the pipe to my neighbour, with the be&s;t grace I was able.</P>
<P>We were now joined by the <HI>maitre d' hotel,</HI> who&s;e gigantic figure corre|&s;ponded with the tremendous &s;ound of his voice, being a tall, bony, man; in &s;tature, when he &s;tood upright, at lea&s;t &s;ix feet four or five inches, with a gri&s;ly black beard; and had on a dirty wool|len night-cap, and a frieze great coat thrown loo&s;ely over his &s;houlders. In this garb he mixed among his gue&s;ts, and inquired if we were inclined to have any refre&s;hment before we pur&s;ued our journey. Upon my ma&s;ter's replying in the affirmative, the kind ho&s;t was bu|&s;ied in preparing &s;ome eggs, with a thick cut from a piece of pork that hung
<PB N="219" REF="230">
in the chimney, dried to that extreme degree, that it was as void of juice, and as hard, as an oak-table; while the ac|compli&s;hed and love-in&s;piring Juggy was placing a three-legged &s;tool before us, which was intended to &s;erve as a table, in lieu of a better; when, all on a &s;udden, the whole proce&s;s of eating was di&s;turbed, and every one's atten|tion engaged, by a noi&s;e and &s;hrieking that &s;eemed to alarm the very ele|ments.</P>
<P>Juggy, who had been di&s;patched for the purpo&s;e of learning the cau&s;e of this terrible outcry, &s;oon returned, with her hands lifted up in wonder, and her face pale with fear, crying out, <HI>Och hone! och hone!</HI>&mdash;With &s;ome difficulty we learned, in the mid&s;t of her lamenta|tions, that a wild <HI>baa&s;t</HI> had bit off the

head of Bryan M'Snivel. Upon this information we all &s;tarted up in an in&s;tant, and ran to the &s;cene of ac|tion.</P>
<P>When we got to our cart, we found a man roaring for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with his head buried in the &s;ack in which my ma&s;ter had tied up the baboon, and then we &s;oon divined the cau&s;e of this bloody and dreadful adventure, which was ex|actly thus.&mdash;The &s;tock of potatoes at the inn being con&s;umed, and Juggy ha|ving forgot to provide a fre&s;h &s;upply on the day before, agreeably to the direc|tions of her ma&s;ter, had prevailed upon Bryan M'Snivel (who, it &s;eems, was one of her humble admirers) to go and fo|rage among the cars before their de|parture, and get a &s;mall quantity out of each &s;ack; and poor Bryan was ac|tually

<P>As &s;oon as my ma&s;ter had di&s;engaged the poor fellow from the teeth of the grinning animal, and brought his head
<PB N="222" REF="233">
once more into open day, he made a mo&s;t rueful and &s;anguinary appearance; the features of his face were totally di&s;|figured with the blood that &s;till conti|nued to flow without intermi&s;&s;ion from the wounded head of the di&s;con&s;olate lover; indeed, upon examination, the perforation which the angry animal had made was &s;o deep, that, had the mis|fortune happened to a &s;cull of common thickne&s;s, his teeth mu&s;t have gone clear through the pia-mater into the brain; but Darby's &s;eat of under&s;tanding was ca&s;ed, very luckily, with none of tho&s;e flim&s;y defences; for, had the baboon penetrated an inch deeper, the wound would have &s;till remained curable.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT ten the &s;ame morning we arrived &s;afe, with all our baggage, at the place of de&s;tination; and, having depo&s;ited our friend Bruin and his com|panion in a place of &s;afety, in a barn which my ma&s;ter had hired for the pur|po&s;e of his exhibition, we began to per|ambulate
<PB N="225" REF="236">
the town, preceded by our trumpeter.</P>
<P>The nature of my office was to di&s;|tribute hand-bills among the people, in which were pompou&s;ly &s;et forth the &s;ur|pri&s;ing wonders that would await their attention at the hour of &s;even in the evening; my ma&s;ter farther illu&s;trating the de&s;cription by a &s;ort of oratory pe|culiar to tho&s;e caterers of amu&s;ement for the vulgar; wherein he did not for|get to inform them, that, for the paltry and low con&s;ideration of three-pence a head, they &s;hould &s;ee the greate&s;t mi|racles that ever were brought into Ire|land &s;ince the reign of Broderic, king of Lein&s;ter.</P>
<P>When we had gone through every part of the place, and announced our arrival, we repaired to the barn, to make
<PB N="226" REF="237">
up a temporary &s;tage, and get every thing in readine&s;s again&s;t the evening, that no di&s;appointment might happen to the audience on the fir&s;t night; to provide again&s;t which my ma&s;ter took unu&s;ual pains, knowing it, from expe|rience, to be a matter extremely e&s;&s;en|tial to our future &s;ucce&s;s, as the people were generally induced to favour him with their company, in proportion to the account that they heard from tho&s;e who attended the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P>After Bruin and the baboon were ta|ken from their confinement, and fed, we began a private rehear&s;al of the feats which it was intended &s;hould be per|formed in the evening; and indeed they acquitted them&s;elves &s;o well, that their leader had &s;trong hopes of acquiring a great &s;hare of reputation, and, eventu|ally,
<PB N="227" REF="238">
much profit, by their approaching performances: but, alas! as the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind have been deluded by too fond an indulgence of hope, it was no wonder that my ma&s;ter &s;hould be de|ceived, who, certainly, had no great claim to the character of a man of wi&s;|dom.</P>
<P>At the propo&s;ed time of beginning, the company came pouring into the barn in great numbers; at the &s;ight of which my ma&s;ter was &s;o elevated, that he de|clared, he believed he &s;hould receive more money, in this place, than he had done in any other, &s;ince he came into that part of the country. Upon my in|forming him that there were upwards of eight and forty &s;hillings already recei|ved, he began to rub his hands, ex|claiming, "a lucky hit, by G&mdash;d!"
<PB N="228" REF="239">
when two &s;tout fellows came behind the &s;cenes, and in&s;tantly laid hold of his collar, followed by a thick-&s;et lu&s;ty man, with a &s;carlet cloak and a bu&s;hy wig; who, it appeared at the conclu|&s;ion, was a ju&s;tice of the peace, and li|ved within a &s;hort mile of the town, and had taken offence, that any per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;ume to exhibit their mum|meries in that town, without fir&s;t a&s;king his permi&s;&s;ion; a compliment, it &s;eems, which he had been always u&s;ed to receive from every itinerant vagabond that vi&s;it|ed his neighbourhood, from the come|dian to the conjurer.</P>
<P>Upon my ma&s;ter (who now began to &s;moke the bu&s;ine&s;s) a&s;king, with great humility, what was the rea&s;on of his being &s;eized in that manner, like a com|mon felon, the magi&s;trate an&s;wered,
<PB N="229" REF="240">
contracting his brows into a mo&s;t fe|rocious frown, "Oh!

<PB N="230" REF="241">
I am afraid to go near 'em, your ho|nour," &s;ays the fellow."&mdash;"Afraid!" &s;ays the fat magi&s;trate, "afraid of what, you blockhead? why, I &s;uppo&s;e, he has neither got a mermaid, nor a cro|codile, nor the huge Behemoth that we read of in the Bible."&mdash;"No, your honour," &s;ays the other, "but he's got a bear and a large monkey."

<PB N="232" REF="243">
&s;prawling on the ground, to the mercy of the bear, who no &s;ooner perceived his prey than he &s;eized him by his po&s;|teriors, and, after &s;haking him for a con&s;iderable time, with great violence, ran out into the town, through the door which they had left open in their con|fu&s;ion, with the little man in his mouth, plunging with his arms and legs to get loo&s;e, and calling out to the people to re&s;cue him for the love of God. After running with him, in that perilous &s;i|tuation, above a quarter of a mile, he quitted his hold, and, making acro&s;s the fields, dropped the ju&s;tice in the middle of the high road, where he was found by his &s;ervants, in a deep &s;woon, a &s;hort time afterwards.</P>
<P>Thus, by a &s;eemingly trivial omi&s;|&s;ion of re&s;pect, was the faire&s;t pro&s;pect

<P>After revolving in my mind the un|fortunate train of events that had taken place, I began to think that this was not a place of &s;afety for me to remain in, more e&s;pecially &s;ince I under&s;tood that the ju&s;tice was a vindictive man; and, as he was notorious for pur&s;uing every per&s;on that he could to de&s;truction, who was unhappy enough to have given him any umbrage whatever, what was I to expect, who was well known to be a

I approached him with an air of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, and, inqui|ring if he knew a place where I could re&s;t for that night, he told me, if it &s;o plea&s;ed me, that I might lodge with him; at the &s;ame time pointing to a &s;mall board over the door, on which was painted, <Q>Dry lodging for tra|vellers,</Q> which, in my contempla|ting

the poor old man, who &s;at at the entrance, I had not noticed.</P>
<P>After inviting me to a &s;hare of his &s;eat, which was made of &s;ods of earth, placed over each other, we entered into di&s;cour&s;e, in the progre&s;s of which I found that my venerable companion had formerly been a con&s;iderable farmer in that county; but, one misfortune happening upon the back of another had reduced him at la&s;t to a &s;tate of ex|treme indigence, at a time of life when the comforts annexed to pro&s;perity are mo&s;t requi&s;ite. I learned that he had been driven out of his la&s;t farm, and his cattle off the lands, for a year's rent, which he had been rendered unable to pay by a fire that had con&s;umed a large &s;tock of corn, on the produce of which, at market, he &s;hould have been

enabled to have &s;atisfied his landlord, who, I found afterwards, was the very individual ju&s;tice, from who&s;e re&s;ent|ment I had made my e&s;cape. Prompt|ed by a de&s;ire to be acquainted with his character, my decrepid ho&s;t complied in the following manner.&mdash;<Q>When Ju&s;tice Guttle fir&s;t came to live in the town of &mdash;, he was neither more or le&s;s than a pettifogging attorney, and, before he had re&s;ided in the place three years, had cau&s;ed more mi&s;|chief and law-&s;uits, among its inha|bitants, than had been known before in the memory of the olde&s;t per&s;on li|ving, and, to do him ju&s;tice, he had rendered him&s;elf completely dete&s;table to all his neighbours: however, having a thorough knowledge of mankind, he always manife&s;ted it, by oppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="237" REF="248">
the poor and flattering the vices of the rich; and he &s;ucceeded &s;o far, by making him&s;elf an active in&s;trument in a long-conte&s;ted county election, in favour of one 'Squire Bribe'em, who originally owned this manor, that he made him his agent; and that ap|pointment was a woeful one to me as well as to his patron; for he had not been in his agency above ten years before he contrived, by one diabolical practice or another, to get the greate&s;t part of the e&s;tate into his own hands; and this was the more ea&s;ily effected, as the '&s;quire &s;eldom came down among his tenantry in the country, but &s;pent his time and his fortune in every &s;pecies of riot and di&s;&s;ipation, till he had reduced him&s;elf &s;o low that he was obliged to live upon a &s;mall an|nuity

in the South of France; while his hone&s;t agent, the ju&s;tice, keeps a coach and four, kills his own veni|&s;on, and wa&s;hes it down every day, after dinner, with at lea&s;t a gallon of claret, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the powers of di|ge&s;tion.</Q></P>
<P>Upon receiving this de&s;cription of the magi&s;trate I ventured to relate to the old man what had pa&s;&s;ed at &mdash;; which when he heard, he told me that I had acted a very wi&s;e part in leaving the town; for it was certain, if ever he got me in his clutches, he would puni&s;h me, upon one pretence or other, mo&s;t &s;everely; and I might think my&s;elf hap|py to get off with a public whipping, and, at lea&s;t, a year's impri&s;onment in the county-jail. I was &s;o much alarm|ed at this account that I determined to

get up at day-break the next morning, le&s;t, by &s;ome untoward accident, it might be di&s;covered that I was in the vicinity of the place.</P>
<P>We were now joined by a maimed &s;oldier and his wife, with a young child at her back, which &s;he contrived to keep there by tying the two ends of her gown together, and forming a &s;ort of bag, in which the child &s;lept in perfect &s;ecurity. Having lodged at the cabin before, they all three walked into the hou&s;e without any &s;ort of ceremony, calling for &s;ome ale. After the war|rior and his yokefellow had refre&s;hed them&s;elves, he came out with the mug in his hand, and offered it to the old man, who refu&s;ed his kindne&s;s, by in|forming him that he had ju&s;t been drinking; upon which he handed the

mug to me, &s;aying, <Q>Here, my lad, you will drink, I &s;uppo&s;e, though the landlord won't.</Q> Thanking him for his kindne&s;s, I took the mug, and drank to his good health. &mdash; <Q>Thankee, thankee, my lad,</Q> &s;aid he; and, &s;it|ting down between me and the reverend ho&s;t, he began to make &s;ome remarks upon the finene&s;s of the evening; at the &s;ame time telling us, una&s;ked, that he had travelled a good forty miles that day, and, being damnably tired, why, he did not care how &s;oon he began to take a comfortable &s;noo&s;e.</P>
