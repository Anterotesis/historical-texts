<P>YOU are welcome, my Friend. But pray, to what may I be indebted for the Favour of this Vi&s;it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>In compliment to your Work, rather than to its Author, I confe&s;s that Curio&s;ity impelled me hither, in &s;pite of &s;ome other urgent Occa&s;ions. Indeed, I
<PB N="4" REF="3">heartily curs'd the Intruders who di&s;turbed us in &s;o intere&s;ting a Point of the Story; and I &s;hould not have &s;lept &s;ince, had I not in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;atisfied my Impati|ence by making out the Remainder in my own Mind.</P>

<P>And pray, how have you contriv|ed the Bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a way, as I thought, that could not be avoided. The natural Affections of a Parent join'd to the recent Obligati|ons, by which old <HI>Clement</HI> was bound to his Son, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily effect a perfect Reconciliation, and all End, as one would wi&s;h, in future Pro&s;perity. In Truth, I thought it full Time to put a Period to the Reader's Di&s;tre&s;s, by putting an End to tho&s;e of the unfortunate <HI>Clement.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then it &s;truck me, this Morn|ing, that the deplorable Condition, in which the&s;e People were found, could not be con&s;i&s;tent with my Plan. This has brought me in a Hurry. I think that my Plan is &s;till the right one. I fear, you
<PB N="5" REF="4">have indulged your&s;elf in the Marvellous, at the Expence of Nature. It is the Fault of all Novelli&s;ts. I am in great Pain for you. I can't conceive how you bring your&s;elf off in this Plunge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>DURING his Fit, the Surgeon, came with his In&s;truments and Dre&s;&s;ings; and, having in vain attempted to re&s;tore him, by &s;prinkling Water in his Face, and by the Application of Hart&s;horn to his No&s;e and Temples; he took &s;ome Blood from him, whereon, he opened his Eyes, and began to breathe with Freedom. He then examined his Wound, which was a little above his Forehead, and declared it &s;o &s;light, as &s;carce to be an Excu&s;e for keeping his Chamber. The Surgeon, having dre&s;&s;ed it, received his Fee and re|tired. And my Father, ringing for the Drawer, ordered up a Fla&s;k of Burgun|dy, with a cold Fowl, Oyl and Vinegar.</P>
<P>When the Table was laid, and the Waiter de&s;ired to withdraw. My Father, again, looking earne&s;tly and compa&s;&s;ively upon me, I believe, &s;ays he, my Child may be hungry; and, &s;trait, his Counte|nance falling, and the Mu&s;cles of his Lips beginning to work, he broke into Tears. Barbarous Wretch! he exclaimed, unnatu|ral O&s;trich! who could, thus, leave the Fir&s;t-begotten of thy Bowels to the Na|kedne&s;s of the Sands, and to the Bla&s;ting of the Elements.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
No, no, my Father, I cried; again throwing my&s;elf on my Knees before him; kill me not with your Tears, cru&s;h me not with this, your unmerited Concern! all is well, all is happy, and ble&s;s'd, as I can bear it to be. This Moment overpays my Years of Angui&s;h, it is like Heaven after pa&s;&s;ing the Vale of Death and mortal Sufferings.</P>
<P>After Supper, of which my Father &s;carce ta&s;ted, he got up, and, as I ro&s;e at the &s;ame Time, he &s;tepped to me, and, catching me pa&s;&s;ionately in his Arms; and putting his Neck acro&s;s mine, my Child, he cried, my beloved Child, my Life's ble&s;&s;ed Pre&s;erver! come, once more, to my Bo&s;om, enter thy for&s;aken Man&s;i|on! too long has it been de&s;art and de&s;o|late, without thee! But, here, I vow to the Almighty, that no Step-Dames, nor viperous In&s;truments, &s;hall ever hereaf|ter in&s;inuate between us; accur&s;ed be they, who &s;hall attempt to divide us; and, may they come to an evil End, who &s;hall de&s;ire to deprive me of thee, the Light of mine Eyes, till I am cold, and in&s;en&s;ible to ev'ry other Joy.</P>
<P>While we &s;at over our Bottle, my Fa|ther called for Ink and Paper, and, fir&s;t pre&s;enting me with a Pur&s;e of fifty Guineas,
<PB N="8" REF="7">he again gave me a Bill, at Sight, on his Banker, for five hundred Pounds. I &s;tarted up, but, &s;topping me, he cried, hold, hold, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> I &s;ee my&s;elf over|pay'd in the Acknowledgments of that dear, though meagre Countenance; and, then, as I kneel'd before him, with both Hands held over me and Eyes rai&s;ed to Heaven, he ble&s;&s;ed me in an Ejaculation of the tendere&s;t Ardour.</P>
<P>The Reckoning being di&s;charged, and two Chairs ordered to the Door, my Fa|ther de&s;ired me to meet him at the &s;ame Tavern, the following Evening; and &s;aid that, in the mean Time, he would think of &s;ettling &s;ome certain Income upon me; and thus we parted, as though our Souls had accompanied each other.</P>
<P>It was now near Two o'Clock, and the Morning bitter cold. My <HI>Arabella</HI> had, long &s;ince, put her Child to Re&s;t; and I found her in Tears by a Fire, &s;carce alive. She &s;tarted up, on my entering; her Face gleamed with a &s;ickly Joy; and &s;he uttered &s;ome &s;oft Reproaches, of Love and Apprehen&s;ion, for my Ab&s;ence at tho&s;e Hours.</P>
<P>Before I ventured to let in the full Tide of our returning Happine&s;s on her weak and alarmed Spirits; I took out &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="8">Confections and a Pint of Sack, which I had purpo&s;ely brought in my Pocket. I broke &s;ome Naple Bi&s;cuit into a Cup, and, pouring &s;ome of the Wine upon it, I &s;et her the Example, and prevail'd on her to eat.</P>
<P>Mean while, &s;he gazed, earne&s;tly, and inqui&s;itively, in my Face. My <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;he tenderly cried, what is the meaning of this? What Eyes are the&s;e, <HI>Hammy,</HI> what new kind of a Countenance is this you have brought home to me? Ah, forbid it, my God! that the Darling of my Soul &s;hould have done any Thing criminal. Fir&s;t, peri&s;h your <HI>Arabella,</HI> peri&s;h al&s;o her Infant, rather than, on our Account, or on any Account, the lea&s;t of the Virtues of my <HI>Hammy</HI> &s;hould be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>No, no, my Angel, I cried, Daughter of highe&s;t Heaven! God has been wonder|fully gracious to me, he ble&s;&s;es me, for your Sake, my <HI>Arabella.</HI> I have &s;een my Father, we are happily reconciled, and Famine and Affliction &s;hall come near us, no more.</P>
<P>I then took the Bellows, and lighted up a good Fire, and, while we were emp|tying our Pint, of which I compelled my Wife to take the larger Share, I gave her a tran&s;porting Detail of what had pa&s;&s;ed;
<PB N="10" REF="9">and poured my Pur&s;e of Guineas into her Lap. So, we went to Bed in Peace, re|gardle&s;s of Futurity, the Happie&s;t of all the Pairs on whom the &s;ucceeding Sun aro&s;e.</P>
<P>We lay in Bed, till the Day was far ad|vanced. I then ordered &s;ome comfort|ing white Wine Caudle for Breakfa&s;t, and, calling up the Landlady, I di&s;charged our Quarter's Rent.</P>
<P>When &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; I con&s;ulted with my Wife whether &s;he would chu&s;e to retire to <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or rather to <HI>York,</HI> or &s;ome other remote Place, within the Kingdom. But, reflecting a|gain, on the pre&s;ent Exce&s;s of my Father's Tenderne&s;s for me, &s;he joined, in think|ing it advi&s;eable to act with his Concur|rence; and I determined, that very Even|ing, to reveal to him, in Confidence, the whole pathetic Hi&s;tory of our Marriage and Adventures.</P>
<P>Mean while, I thought it be&s;t, in all Events, to &s;ecure the Means of moderate|ly compa&s;&s;ing our Purpo&s;e, by taking up the &pound;500 from my Father's Banker. I found, by Experience, that I had now little to fear from being known to any one. My &s;habby Apparel, and emaciated Face and Limbs, that had prevented the Know|ledge
<PB N="11" REF="10">and Remembrance of a Father, ap|peared a double Security again&s;t all other Eyes. I therefore adventured, though not without Circum&s;pection, to Mr. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in <HI>Lombard Street,</HI> and, pre&s;enting my Bill, demanded Payment.</P>
<P>My Friend, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Giles,</HI> it is not two Hours, &s;ince a Stop was put to the Pay|ment of that Draught; and I was de&s;ired, at the &s;ame Time, to put this Paper into the Hands of the Party who &s;hould call. So &s;aying, he gave me a Note which I opened, with a Trepidation that was turn|ed into Agony on reading the following Words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To <HI>Hammel Clement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOST &s;ubtle, and mo&s;t accur&s;ed of all cruel Contrivers! thou did&s;t thy&s;elf, then, &s;et that Villain on thy fooli&s;h and fond Father, by whom his Blood was &s;hed, and his Life nearly lo&s;t. I renounce thee, I abjure thee from henceforth, and for ever. And, as I continue to di&s;claim all Sorts of Ties with thee, either here, or hereaf|ter; &s;o may Heaven continue to pro&s;per,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
On reading this dreadful Paper, I retir|ed from the Counter without &s;peaking a Word. I got home, I know not how, for I neither knew what I did, nor con&s;i|dered what I was about. I walked up Stairs, without perceiving that I was fol|lowed. But, I had &s;carce got into my Room, when five or &s;ix Men entered, almo&s;t along with me; and one of them, &s;tepping directly up to my Wife, cried, Mi&s;tre&s;s, I arre&s;t you in his Maje&s;ty's Name.</P>
<P>Hereat, I turned, and was &s;tunned, and rouzed again in an In&s;tant. I caught up the Poker, and, aiming at a well dre&s;&s;ed Man, who&s;e Face was not wholly unknown, and who appeared the mo&s;t active and joyous of the Crew, I mi&s;&s;ed the Crown of his Head, but tore off one Ear, and cut him, through his Cloaths and Shoulder, to the Bone. I then flew upon the re&s;t. I dealt my Blows, with inconceivable Fury and Quickne&s;s. I cleared my Room in a few Seconds and, tho' &s;everal Shots were fir|ed at me from the Stairs, I cha&s;ed them all to the Entry, and, returning to my <HI>Arabella,</HI> I barrocaded the Door.</P>
<P>It was then that &s;he interpo&s;ed, and, dropping on her Knees before me, what is my <HI>Hammy</HI> about, &s;he cried, what Mad|ne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="12">has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my Love? Would you be guilty of actual and in&s;tant Murders, through a ra&s;h and vain Attempt, of re&s;cu|ing from our Laws a Per&s;on whom nei|ther God, nor Man hath yet condemn|ed? This, indeed, were to en&s;ure the Ruin you apprehend. Ah, no, my Heart's Ma&s;ter, let us neither commit nor fear Iniquity. Join with me, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> let us tru&s;t in our GOD, and nothing, but Good, can happen unto us.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, the late Terrors of her Countenance di&s;appeared; and her A&s;pect was gradually over&s;pread with a Serenity, to be imagined, in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure, from the Face of an Evening Hea|ven in Autumn; when the Songs of Har|ve&s;t are heard through the Villages, all about.</P>
<P>I gazed on her, with a &s;peechle&s;s and complacent Reverence. She gently took the Weapon from my unre&s;i&s;ting Hand; and, leading me back, &s;he &s;eated me in the furthe&s;t Chair. She, then, removed every Bar and Ob&s;tacle to their Entrance. The Stairs were, now, filled with People who had been called to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King's Officers, but they &s;till appeared apprehen&s;ive and fearful of advancing.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Gentlemen, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> be plea&s;ed to walk in; I deliver my&s;elf peaceably into your Hands; ye &s;hall find no further Op|po&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty or the Laws. The Officers, accordingly entered, but bowing, and with a timid kind of Re|&s;pect; neither did any of them offer to lay a Hand upon her. Good God! Ma|dam, exclaimed the Foremo&s;t, is it po&s;&s;i|ble you &s;hould be guilty of the Crimes laid to your Charge, by that Ra&s;cal whom your Hu&s;band has Half killed. He is carried off to the Doctors; but I think, in my Con&s;cience, that he has got his De|&s;erts; and, as for the few Hurts that we have received, we excu&s;e your Hu&s;band, Madam, for your Sake; and we think him the braver and the better Man, for what he did. By my Soul, &s;weet Madam, you are well worth defending.</P>
<P>I thank ye, Gentlemen, &s;aid my Wife, gracefully &s;miling and curt&s;eying; pray, be plea&s;ed to &s;it, while I prepare to attend you. I am guilty, indeed, of the Death of a Man, and, yet, guilty of nothing that I would not repeat in the Defence of Virtue. But, Gentlement, &s;ays &s;he, again &s;miling, you are likely to be troubled with more Pri&s;oners than you look for. One of them, indeed, is young, and, as little meaning of Harm to any One, as his
<PB N="15" REF="14">Mother. I mu&s;t, therefore, beg your In|dulgence in &s;ending for a Coach; and, pray, do me the Favour to accept this Trifle, as the Means of wa&s;hing away Animo&s;ity between you and my Hu&s;band. So &s;aying, &s;he pre&s;ented their Chief with a Guinea, who, ri&s;ing and awfully bow|ing, ordered one of the others to &s;tep for a Coach.</P>
<P>Had the Harp of <HI>Orpheus</HI> been tuned, like the Voice of my <HI>Arabella</HI> at this Sea|&s;on; it is not to be wondered that Tygers &s;hould grow tame, and Bears crouch down before him, and lick his Feet. Since Wretches like the&s;e, hardened in hourly Acts of In&s;olence and Inhumanity, were now awed to downca&s;t Reverence; and, on her Return from the Clo&s;et with her Infant in her Arms, dropped a Tear of &s;till Compa&s;&s;ion, as though they had not, wholly, forgotten, that they were born of Women.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, my Fury having &s;ub&s;ided at the In&s;tance of my Wife, I &s;hould certainly have fainted, if I had not been relieved by a Gu&s;h of Tears; which I endeavoured to conceal, by turn|ing a&s;ide and putting my Hankerchief to my Face. A Cloud, of thick Darkne&s;s again over&s;pread my Soul; and every in|ternal
<PB N="16" REF="15">Idea grew pregnant, and laboured with Apprehen&s;ion and Horror. I cur&s;ed my Meeting with my Father, and his treacherous Appearance of Bounty, which had &s;erved to bring this deci&s;ive Ruin up|on us; and I looked upon Fortune as &s;oli|citous and indu&s;trious, to bring Evil and De&s;truction, out of every Pre&s;entment and Promi&s;e of Advantage.</P>
<P>Being conducted to Newgate, I agreed with the Keeper for a tolerable Apartment, at two Guineas <HI>per</HI> Week; and, putting on the be&s;t Chear I could affect before my Wife, I &s;ent out for a nouri&s;hing Din|ner. For I judged it late to be frugal, when Death was at our Door, and I had determined not to &s;urvive my <HI>Arabella,</HI> a Moment.</P>
<P>The Day following, I procured Copies of the Depo&s;itions of the three Witne&s;&s;es, the Fir&s;t of whom was our own Servant Maid. The&s;e I laid before two of the mo&s;t learned in the Law, but, received no Con&s;olation from their Report. They told me that, had my Wife been actually guilty of the Robbery, as alledged, &s;he might have had &s;ome Pro&s;pect of being acquitted of the Murder, by being enabled to bribe off the Evidence. But, that, if &s;he was really innocent of the Robbery as I affirmed, it, then, became the very
<PB N="17" REF="16">Cau&s;e, as well as Intere&s;t of the guilty Evidence, to have her condemned on both Articles of Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>As the fearful Day approached, I bought, at &s;econd hand, two decent Suits of Mourning, with the requi&s;ite Appenda|ges for my Wife and my&s;elf. Whenever I could get apart, I was drowned in my Tears, and Half &s;uffocated by my Sobs; and I did every Thing, but pray, for my <HI>Arabella;</HI> for I could not think of lifting my Heart to a Heaven, where I had lo&s;t all Dependance.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, my Beloved daily recovered Fel&s;h and Health. Her Eyes grew more brilliant, her Complexion more clear, her Countenance was, as the Sur|face of a Depth of Peace; and I gathered, I knew not why, a kind of reflected Con|fidence, by beholding her A&s;pect.</P>
<P>Early, on the fatal Morning, when I had left her within at her Prayers, and had pulled my Hat over my Eyes, and &s;at down in a Corner, to vent the Throbbings of my Heart; I ca&s;t my Eye on a Paper that appeared from under the Door. I took it up with Precipitation, and, in it, found the following Lines.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' Mountains threat thy naked Head,</L>
<L>Tho' circling Gulphs around thee clo&s;e,</L>
<L>Tho' Help is di&s;tant; Hope is dead;</L>
<L>Tho' Eearth and Hell are &s;worn thy Foes:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Yet, Heav'n their Malice &s;hall defy,</L>
<L>And &s;trong, in la&s;t Extremes, to &s;ave;</L>
<L>Shall &s;tand, with guardian Seraphs, nigh;</L>
<L>And, with thy Sland'rers, glut the Grave.</L>
</LG>
<P>I had no &s;ooner read this Paper, than I dropped down, involuntarily, on my Knees. My Hands clenched together; and I breathed up a mo&s;t ardent Petition, that &s;ome over-ruling Power would take my <HI>Arabella</HI> under his Protection.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;he came forth, adorned like the Moon when girt about with Clouds, through who&s;e Blackne&s;s her Beauty breaks forth with improved Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>While we fat at Breakfa&s;t, I pre&s;ented her with the Ver&s;es. She read them, over and over, with deep Attention; and then, returning them with a Smile; this, &s;ays &s;he, has been the Stratagem of &s;ome ve|ry charitable Per&s;on, who judged that
<PB N="19" REF="18">Hope was wanting to &s;upport me at &s;uch a Trial.</P>
<P>As the dreadful Hour was at Hand; and as I had con&s;idered, before now, that at la&s;t it mu&s;t come. I had prepared a &s;mall Bottle of Salts and a Cordial, to &s;upport my&s;elf, as well as my Wife, from an un&s;eemly Dejection of Spirits in Court.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! can you tell me how one Thing &s;hould come to pa&s;s? can you ac|count for this mo&s;t extraordinary of all the Workings in human Nature? That a Man, at &s;ome times, &s;hould more feeling|ly live, or die in Others, than in him&s;elf. Had I been called to my la&s;t Audit, had the Deci&s;ion of my own Exi&s;tence been at Stake, my Apprehen&s;ions, as I think, could not have equalled what I felt, at that Period.</P>
<P>At length, the Keeper appeared, and warned my <HI>Arabella</HI> that &s;he mu&s;t &s;pee|dily &s;et out. I turned, in&s;tantly, cold and pale; and, it was long before I recovered Strength to ri&s;e from my Chair. In the mean Time my Wife returned to our Bedchamber, and, bringing out her In|fant, gave him in Charge to a Nur&s;e|keeper; &s;he, then, held her Hands over him, and rai&s;ed her Eyes to Heaven, in Ble&s;&s;ing, for &s;ome Time. Again &s;he fixed
<PB N="20" REF="19">them on his Face, and, gazing upon him, as it were, for a la&s;t farewel Look; Tear dropped after Tear, in a pathetic and af|fectionate Silence.</P>
<P>Being conducted to the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> my Wife, on entering the Court, turned &s;ud|denly pale; and her Countenance was downca&s;t with a Diffidence that &s;he could not for &s;ome Time overcome. The Con|cour&s;e was exce&s;&s;ively great, and, chiefly, con&s;i&s;ting of the Nobility and Gentry of both Sexes. The great Man him&s;elf was there, with a Croud of his Dependents, and all the male and female Relations and Friends of the Decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I gave my <HI>Arabella</HI> the Salts to &s;mell to, and, as &s;he weakly, and ba&s;hfully ad|vanced to the Bar, a confu&s;ed and jarring Murmur was heared on all Sides; and the Words <HI>Impudence,</HI> and <HI>Innocence,</HI> re|&s;ounded throughout.</P>
<P>When, according to Order, &s;he had held up her Hand, and heared her Indict|ment; the Judge, with a Countenance and Voice equally &s;tern, demanded Guilty or not Guilty? She an&s;wered, Guilty, my Lord, I confe&s;s, of the Death of Lord <HI>Stivers,</HI> but, never guilty of any Kind of Robbery or Malice. Woman, &s;aid the Judge, you confe&s;s your&s;elf guilty, and I
<PB N="21" REF="20">&s;hould proceed to your Sentence. But, I a&s;k you, for the la&s;t Time, Guilty or not Guilty? Not guilty, my Lord, &s;he then rejoined; if to do what I approve, and &s;hall never repent of, is not to be guilty.</P>
<P>Again, the Murmur was repeated, but continued much longer, and, with more Virulence on the one Part, and more Concern on the other.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain you, Sir, with an Ac|count of the Examination of the two fir&s;t Witne&s;&s;es, one of whom had been our own Servant Girl, and the other the prin|cipal Footman of Lord <HI>Stivers.</HI> They had all Manner of Encouragement, and Coun|tenance from the Court, and concurred in ev'ry Circum&s;tance that cou'd &s;erve for Condemnation. The Sound of Triumph was heared, through all the Gentry, and the Populace, &s;ighingly, gave my <HI>Arabella</HI> for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The third Witne&s;s was then called. He was a very genteel and mode&s;t-looking young Man, and was now out of Livery.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays he, with a re&s;pectful but re&s;olute Voice, before I give my Te&s;timo|ny in this Ca&s;e, I reque&s;t that the two fir&s;t Witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be taken into Cu&s;to|dy. Into Cu&s;tody? cried the Judge, do
<PB N="22" REF="21">you know what you &s;ay? I do know what I &s;ay, my Lord, and I repeat my Reque&s;t that they &s;hould be taken into Cu&s;tody. Why, Friend, &s;aid the Judge, they are, as you are, they are Witne&s;&s;es for the Crown again&s;t a Criminal, and no Man has a Right to order them into Cu&s;tody. I &s;ay, rejoined the Youth, with an Air &s;till more determined, that they are Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t Innocence, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and again&s;t the Laws. That they alone are crimi|nal; that I am Evidence again&s;t them; and, I, again, require it of your Lord&s;hip, of the Jury, and of all pre&s;ent, that they &s;hould not be permitted to make their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, exclaimed the Judge, you are a prevaricating Villain; but, I &s;hall trounce you before we part. Where is this Fel|low's Examination?</P>
<P>My Lord, my Lord, &s;aid the young Man, with &s;omewhat of a &s;evere and &s;ar|ca&s;tical Tone. You were not placed there to prejudicate, in any Matter; no more than I was called here to be Brow-beat and &s;entenced without Trial. If you find that I prevaricate, if you de&s;ire to fift me as Wheat, and find any Chaff in me; I re|fu&s;e not the bittere&s;t Puni&s;hment that our Laws can inflict. But, as your Lord&s;hip
<PB N="23" REF="22">ob&s;erves, I am an Evidence for the Crown, and his Maje&s;ty, God be prai&s;ed, will not fix his Tribunal in any Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. I therefore demand to be heared, in the Cau&s;e to which I am cited; and all pre|&s;ent &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;peak nothing but the Truth. And you, Gentlemen of the Jury! I petition you to intercede, in favour of Equity with his Lord&s;hip, and to prevail that the&s;e Criminals, for &s;uch I affirm them to be, &s;hould not be &s;uffered to get away. And further, that they &s;hould be in&s;tantly &s;earched; and all, that is found about them, re&s;erved for the In|&s;pection of your&s;elves and his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid the Foreman, I humbly conceive that no ill Con&s;equence can en|&s;ue; from &s;earching and &s;etting a Watch over tho&s;e People; their Te&s;timony is al|ready given, and can't be invalidated thereby.</P>
<P>I cannot agree to it, an&s;wered the Judge. They are free Subjects. There is no Indictment nor Depo&s;ition again&s;t them. They are, al&s;o, Evidence for his Maje&s;ty, and are therefore under his peculiar Pro|tection. But, I would willingly hear what this Fellow, this Turncoat has to &s;ay for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
My Lord, replied the Youth, I now &s;tand before a Tribunal that is, infinitely, more aweful than that of your Lord&s;hip. And, provided I approve my Truth be|fore God, I &s;hall be the le&s;s afflicted for having fallen under your Lord&s;hip's Di&s;|plea&s;ure. My Name is <HI>Edward Longfield.</HI> I was born to happier Pro&s;pects. My Father was a Gentleman. And, about eighteen Months ago, I took the Degree of Batchelor at Queen's College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> But, Misfortunes and Mi&s;under&s;tandings happening in our Family, I was left to be the Former of my own Fortunes, and, ar|riving at <HI>London,</HI> I was taken into Service by my late Lord <HI>Stivers.</HI> He grew fond of me, beyond my Merits, and I began to partake of his Friend&s;hip and Confidence, at the Time that I was deprived, of the mo&s;t generous of Ma&s;ters, by the mo&s;t un|happy of all Events.</P>
<P>My Lord had one Foil to his many Virtues. It was an invincible Pa&s;&s;ion for Female-Beauty. The la&s;t Night of his Life, having called me a&s;ide, <HI>Ned,</HI> &s;ays he, I mu&s;t take you on an Adventure To-morrow. I have po&s;itively the fine&s;t Girl in the Univer&s;e in Cha&s;e; and I mu&s;t enjoy her in all Events. But the Devil on't is that &s;he is virtuous, though I hope not incorruptible. I have put her
<PB N="25" REF="24">Hu&s;band out of the Way upon a feigned Action for Debt; and I have bribed her Maid over to my Party. So, that I have nothing to contend with but her own lovely Per&s;on, and that will be the &s;weet|e&s;t Di&s;pute in the World. Sure, my Lord, I cried, you wouldn't force her. P&s;haw, &s;aid he, damn your impertinent Scruples. Another &s;uch Word, <HI>Ned,</HI> and you are blown with me, I can tell you. A fine Woman, my Lad, mu&s;t be won at any Rate; if &s;he is garri&s;oned with Virtue, and cannot be got by Stratagem; &s;he mu&s;t be taken by Storm.</P>
<P>The Day following, my Lord took me, and his Footman <HI>Robert</HI> there, who is one of the Witne&s;&s;es, to a Tavern directly op|po&s;ite to the Hou&s;e of the Pri&s;oner. He dined there, alone, and kept us in wait|ing mo&s;t Part of the Afternoon, in expec|tation of Intelligence from that other Wit|ne&s;s there, who has borne fal&s;e Te&s;timony again&s;t her Mi&s;tre&s;s. As he looked out, from Time to Time, at one of the Street Windows, he at la&s;t, as I &s;uppo&s;e, re|ceived the appointed Signal; for, hurry|ing down Stairs, he ordered us to follow. The Door was, purpo&s;ely, held open for us by that Woman. Is all &s;afe, <HI>Deb?</HI> &s;ays my Lord, Yes, &s;ays <HI>Deb;</HI> but may I de|pend on the&s;e who come with you? You may Child, cries my Lord, they are my
<PB N="26" REF="25">own People. It's very well, cries <HI>Deb,</HI> I have ju&s;t got Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgins</HI> out of your Way. My Mi&s;tre&s;s is above and alone for want of better Company. To her then, my Lord, &s;he is a Di&s;h for an Em|peror. But, if &s;he &s;hould prove too many for you, I know where the Shame will lie for ever. Well, well, cries my Lord, &s;hut the Door &s;oftly <HI>Deb;</HI> and take the&s;e Lads, down with you, to the Kitchen. But, whatever ye hear, on your Lives! let me have no Stir, I charge ye. So &s;ay|ing, my Lord went, tripping, up Stairs; and we followed that bad Woman to her darker Region.</P>
<P>I &s;oon ob&s;erved that my Campanion, Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> there, was intent on making up his Acquaintance with Mrs. <HI>Deborah;</HI> and, as I found my&s;elf extremely unea&s;y, I gave them the &s;lip, without being ob|&s;erved; and, &s;tealing up Stairs, I put my Ear to the Door where I heared the Voice of my Ma&s;ter. Ble&s;&s;ed Heaven! to what &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Sentiments was I, then, an a|mazed Witne&s;s! to what Proofs of a Vir|tue, that cannot be rated, at le&s;s than Di|vine! If I &s;hould not be tedious, I would deliver to the Court; to you, my Lord, in particular; and to you Gentlemen of the Jury; the be&s;t Account, I can, of tho&s;e wonderful Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
Hear him, hear him, hear him! was then almo&s;t the univer&s;al Cry! till he was permitted, by the Bench; and de&s;ired, by the Jury to &s;peak with Freedom.</P>
<P>He, then, repeated, in a more ample and pathetic Manner, all that pa&s;&s;ed, as I have told you, between Lord <HI>Stivers</HI> and my Wife. But, &s;topping, as he drew near to the fatal Cata&s;trophe. I could no longer bear, he &s;aid, the piercing Cries, and agonizing Shrieks of &s;uch Virtue, in &s;uch Extremity. Had I any kind of Weapon, I thought I &s;hould have done my Lord good Service, by protecting the Purity, he was about to violate. But I trembled and grew exceeding &s;ick, and, ha&s;t'ning down to the Kitchen, I threw my&s;elf into a Chair and &s;wooned away.</P>
<P>While I was in my Fit, and that <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Deborah</HI> were bu&s;y about me. The fatal Stroke, as I imagine, was given, and the Pri&s;oner made her E&s;cape, with her Infant in her Arms. When I was &s;omewhat recovered, and had taken a Dram of Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI>'s Bottle; &s;he put down the Kettle and invited us to a Di&s;h of Tea. I reque&s;ted my Companions, from Time to Time, to &s;tep out and li&s;|ten; but they reported that all was quiet above Stairs; and, when I wondered at
<PB N="28" REF="27">this; tut, &s;ays <HI>Deborah,</HI> the Lovers have made it up before now, I warrant; and my Mi&s;tre&s;s is &s;o well plea&s;ed with what &s;he was forced to, that it's well for your Ma&s;ter if he gets off before Midnight.</P>
<P>At length it grew darki&s;h, and, being all of us &s;urpriz'd that no Candles were called for, we went, in a Body, up Stairs, and <HI>Deborah</HI> ventured, gently, to tap at the Door; but, hearing no Voice nor Stirring in the Chamber, &s;he turned the Bolt, &s;oftly; and, peeping in, &s;he gave a loud Shriek, and drew &s;uddenly back a|gain. We then entered together, and as I was prepared, by my Knowledge of the Lady's Virtue, for &s;ome dreadful Cata&s;|trophe, I was the le&s;s &s;hocked and con|cerned at what I beheld.</P>
<P>The Floor was Half covered with clot|ted Blood. My Ma&s;ter lay in the Mid&s;t, already &s;tiff and cold; and Part of the fa|tal Sci&s;&s;ars was, &s;till, within the Wound. We all &s;tood, for &s;ome Time, in &s;ilent A&s;toni&s;hment and then, with joint Tears, lamented his Fate. At length, &s;ays <HI>Debo|rah,</HI> I would gladly &s;ee if my bloody Mi&s;|tre&s;s has taken Care to provide for her Journey: So &s;aying, &s;he &s;tooped, and, taking his Lord&s;hip's Pur&s;e from his Pocket, &s;he counted down two hundred and ninety &s;even Guineas. She, then,
<PB N="29" REF="28">took out his fine Gold-Repeater; and, next, his Gold Snuff-Box; and la&s;t took his large Diamond Ring from his Finger.</P>
<P>Come my Lads, &s;ays <HI>Deborah,</HI> my Lord's Silence gives Con&s;ent, and we can no more be &s;aid to rob this Piece of Earth, than the People in the Mines, who gather Gold from Clay. If my Mi&s;tre&s;s is ever taken, &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer Death for the Mur|der; and they can do no more to her, for the Robbery, and twenty &s;uch Matters together. If you will, therefore, be of my Coun&s;el, we will comfort our&s;elves, as we ought, for this melancholy Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;hare a Prize between us, that no one el&s;e has a Right to, and that no Body will want.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> did not he&s;itate long. In a little Time, he appeared more &s;anguine than <HI>Deborah</HI> her&s;elf; and they urged me to join them, by a Number of intere&s;ting and cajoling In&s;tances. I was di&s;pirited. I was affrighted. I &s;aw a Scene of Blood and Slaughter before me; and I doubted not that, if I refu&s;ed them, I &s;hould be made the &s;econd Victim to their Re&s;ent|ment and Avarice. I pretended to value the Watch at an unmea&s;urable Rate, and that I &s;hould be greatly the Gainer, if I got it for my Dividend. Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> then went to her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Drawers; and,
<PB N="30" REF="29">taking out Half a Dozen of Silver Spoons, a Tea Equipage, and &s;everal Articles in Laces and Cambricks; &s;he fairly laid them before us; and ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame Time, that her Mi&s;tre&s;s would not call in a Hurry to demand them; and that the Landlord would take all if we did not come in for Snacks. She then made a new Divi&s;ion, &s;he compelled me further to accept of the Snuff-Box. She gave the Pur&s;e of Gold intire to <HI>Robert;</HI> and con|tented, her&s;elf with the Diamond Ring, &s;ome Gold Medals, my Lord's Handker|chief, and the Plunder of her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> was in this Part of his Te&s;timony; the Foreman of the Jury cried out, Stay, Sir! Good People, pray &s;top tho&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, there! I &s;ee, they are making off. And, now, do us the Fa|vour to &s;earch their Pockets; and to put what ye find into two Hats &s;everally; and to hand them up to us.</P>
<P>This being accordingly done; Mr. <HI>Long|field,</HI> &s;ays the Foreman, be plea&s;ed now to proceed.</P>
<P>I have little further to &s;ay, replied Mr. <HI>Longfield.</HI> Here is my noble Ma&s;ter's Watch; and here is his Snuff-Box. They are undoubtedly known to many honoura|ble Per&s;ons, at pre&s;ent, in Court. And,
<PB N="31" REF="30">I ble&s;s my God that I have been enabled to pre&s;erve them, for the Vindication of Innocence, and the Illu&s;tration of Virtue, at this Day.</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> pau&s;ed; and the Judge cried out, Clerk, hand me up the Examination of this Prevaricator. This his Lord&s;hip peru&s;ed with a Countenance, and Scrutiny, apparently inveterate. But, finding that the Deponent had not touched upon the Robbery; and, that neither the Words, <HI>feloniou&s;ly,</HI> nor, <HI>of malice,</HI> were in|&s;erted in that Part, that referred to the Death of Lord <HI>Stivers,</HI> he tore the Exami|nation into twenty Pieces. Come, come, he cried, again, I have not yet done with this &s;ame <HI>Longfield.</HI> I perceive, perfectly well, how he came by the Watch and Suff-Box. The Transference was not diffi|cult, from the Pri&s;oner, who &s;tole them, to this her Confederate. But, tell us, my wonderfully hone&s;t Friend! How came you to keep the&s;e Things from their lawful Owners, for the very long Space of twelve Months and upward? Why did you not, immediately, or long before now, give Examinations again&s;t tho&s;e, whom you &s;o &s;uddenly take it into your Head to accu&s;e? And, why would you &s;uffer that, &s;o ex|ceeding cha&s;te, and innocent Lady, to la|bour, all this Time, under the Infamy
<PB N="32" REF="31">with which her Character, in my Judg|ment, is &s;till ju&s;tly loaded?</P>
<P>To all the&s;e Que&s;tions, Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> barely &s;miled; but, bowing with his Head, and making a Motion with his Hand to two Gentlemen, who &s;at on one Side in the Gallery. Mr. <HI>Archibald,</HI> an eminent Merchant, and an Alderman of the City, got up and &s;poke to the following Effect.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, my Lord, that I could as well content your Lord&s;hip, as I can &s;atisfy the Jury, and all others pre&s;ent, on the Arti|cles you require. The Day, immediately &s;ucceeding this fatal Accident, Mr. <HI>Long|field</HI> came to me, and, in pre&s;ence of Mr. <HI>Truelove</HI> here, my worthy and &s;ub&s;tantial Neighbour, gave a Detail, almo&s;t Word for Word, of all that he has this Hour depo&s;ed in Court. He then depo&s;ited the Watch and Snuff-Box with us; and did not reclaim them till early this Morning. As I am of his Maje&s;ty's Peace, he, al&s;o, gave in this Examination, before me, which however I mu&s;t not venture to hand over to your Lord&s;hip, till I have your previous Engagement that you will not tear it. I thereupon offered to i&s;&s;ue Warrants for apprehending the Delin|quents; but Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly and judiciou&s;ly, ob&s;erved, that &s;uch a Step mu&s;t, unque&s;tionably, &s;hut the Door a|gain&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="32">Ju&s;tice and all Knowledge of the Truth. That the Criminals were Two to One, again&s;t their Accu&s;er. That on the &s;lighte&s;t Alarm, they would infallibly ab|&s;cond. Or make away with the Effects, of which they now held them&s;elves the peaceable and unque&s;tioned Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Or contrive &s;ome further Plot, to invalidate his Evidence. Or, probably, make him away by Pi&s;tol, or Poi&s;on, and &s;o deprive that unhappy Gentlewoman of the only Witne&s;s of her Innocence. But, &s;ays he, if they are permitted to enter the Court, under the Confidence of my Confederacy; they will have no Re&s;erve upon them; no foreformed Eva&s;ions, or Contrivances for E&s;cape. My unexpected Te&s;timony will &s;uddenly confound their Guilt; and, they may happen to carry &s;ome Articles about them, which might &s;erve for their Convic|tion, beyond ten Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> Mr. <HI>Truelove,</HI> and I, were &s;olicitous and un|wearied in our Inquiries after the unfor|tunate Pri&s;oner, that we might per&s;uade her to &s;tand her Trial, and to deliver her&s;elf up to Ju&s;tice. But all our Search proved fruitle&s;s, till the Day in which &s;he was di&s;covered and taken.</P>
<P>Here, Mr. <HI>Archibald</HI> ended, and the Judge exclaimed; Crier! call the two fir&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="33">Witne&s;&s;es into Court; that we may hear what they &s;ay to this fair Weather Speech. The Crier, accordingly vociferated &s;everal <HI>O Ye&s;es,</HI> for <HI>Deborah Skinner,</HI> and <HI>Robert Callan,</HI> to come into Court. But, had they been within call, they did not chu&s;e to hear. During the Attention of the Court and Jury to Alderman <HI>Archibald,</HI> they had imperceptibly &s;lipped behind their next Neighbours, and proceeding, in like Manner, from one to another, they at length confounded them&s;elves with the Croud, and got clear off.</P>
<P>My Lord, then, began to &s;um his Charge to the Jury; and dwell't, with much Empha&s;is, on &s;ome Articles. Here, &s;ays he, we have lo&s;t a Nobleman; a Mi|ni&s;ter; one of the fir&s;t Ornaments of our Country, and Stays of our Land. And what, I pray ye, have we got, in recom|pence of this great Damage? Why, my Friends, we have got a new Thing upon the Earth; we have got a Saving of the Honour of a Milliner But, if this Prin|ce&s;s is inviolate, as &s;till is pretended; how come &s;he to be guilty of this mo&s;t horrid of all Murders, before &s;he knew to what Extremity his Lord&s;hip would have pro|ceeded? How did &s;he dare, capitally, to execute a Peer of the Realm, on a &s;imple Attempt, for which our Laws would not have confined a common Porter? This
<PB N="35" REF="34">Woman mu&s;t, certainly, have been a Tra|der in Blood; and her felonious Intents, and Malice, are fully expre&s;&s;ed, in the ve|ry peculiar U&s;e and Inhumanity of the Weapon, with which &s;he perpetrated this mo&s;t de&s;perate Deed. You need not therefore, Gentlemen go out of you Box to bring her in guilty of the Murder. I will not affirm, with equal Certainty, touching the Robbery. And yet, to me it is apparent, that &s;he could not have enter|prized &s;o barbarous a Fact, if &s;he had not done it in Pro&s;pect of plundering the De|cea&s;ed. But, as &s;he is capitally puni&s;hable in the fir&s;t In&s;tance; I leave ye, Gentle|men, to determine of the Second, at Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, permit us, my Lord, replied the Foreman, to examine what we have got in the&s;e Hats. He then drew a long Pur&s;e, from among the Relicks of <HI>Robert,</HI> and having counted out &s;eventy Guineas, Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;ays he, would you know my Lord's Pur&s;e? If it is my Ma&s;ter's Pur&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Longfield,</HI> it is of green Silk, and has toward the Top, a Coronet and the Letter <HI>S.</HI> wrought under it, in Silver Twi&s;t. The very &s;ame Sir indeed, rejoin|ed the Foreman. And, now, let us &s;ee what Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> might have got in her hone&s;t Keeping? So &s;aying he took, from the &s;econd Hat, a &s;mall Wooden Box. It
<PB N="36" REF="35">was nearly &s;tuffed with Cotton, in which he found my Lord's Diamond Ring, three Gold Medals, and the Ends of the Han|dles of &s;everal &s;ilver Spoons. Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I imagine we may have got &s;ome of your Property, among us. Pray, had you any Mark to your Silver Spoons? Yes Sir, &s;aid &s;he, &s;carce audible; a <HI>G.</HI> at Top for <HI>Graves,</HI> and a <HI>D.</HI> and <HI>A.</HI> below, for <HI>Dorothy</HI> and <HI>Arabella.</HI> I wi&s;h, Madam, replied this Gentleman, that we were e|qually enabled to find an Equivalent for your Merits, as to re&s;tore to you this trifling Remnant of your Rights.</P>
<P>Come, Gentlemen, cried the Judge, the Day wears apace. It is Time for ye to retire, and con&s;ult on the Verdict ye are to bring in.</P>
<P>My Lord, an&s;wered the Foreman, you, truely ob&s;erved that we need not leave our Box, for the Purpo&s;e you require. We are already agreed, and unanimous in our Verdict. And, I would to Heaven! that we were not confined, on this Occa|&s;ion, to literal Precedents and Forms of Law; that we might give a Verdict, &s;ome way adequate to the Merits of the Pri&s;o|ner, who, however depre&s;&s;ed by Fortune, is &s;uperior in all Excellencies; whom we judge to be an Honour to Human-Na|ture,
<PB N="37" REF="36">and the fir&s;t Grace and Ornament of her own Sex. But, &s;ince we are limit|ed, by Cu&s;tom, in the&s;e Matters. We do &s;ay, with one Voice, and a Con&s;cience that compells us to Utterance. Not Guil|ty, my Lord, not guilty!</P>
<P>The Words were &s;carce pronounced, when the Court-Hou&s;e was almo&s;t &s;plit by a &s;udden Peal. Hats, Caps, and Wigs, univer&s;ally filled the Air, and jo&s;tled a|gain&s;t each-other. The Triumph was caught and echoed by the Crouds with|out; and the Sound was repeated, and floated, from Street to Street, till it &s;eem|ed to die away, in di&s;tant Parts of the City.</P>
<P>My Wife, then turned gracefully Curt|&s;ying to the Foreman, I thank you, Sir, &s;ays &s;he; I thank ye, Gentlemen, &s;ays &s;he again, Curt&s;ying to the Re&s;t of the Jury. And then, glancing mode&s;tly round, &s;he &s;aluted the A&s;&s;embly, and &s;at down. But I could not contain my Gratitude, my Tran&s;port overpowered me; and, falling on my Knees, and lifting my Hands to|ward the Jury. GOD, alone, can reward ye, Gentlemen, I cried; may he for ever pre&s;erve the Pro&s;perities, Honours, and Families, of the worthy Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> from Violation and In&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
I then ro&s;e, ha&s;tily. I &s;lipped out of the Bar; and, ru&s;hing up to Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> I catched him, eagerly, about the Neck. I could not &s;peak. I hid my Face in his Bo&s;om, and broke into Tears. He at|tempted to di&s;engage him&s;elf; but I held him fa&s;t. I believe, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t be Mr. <HI>Clement.</HI> I congratulate you, Sir, with all my Soul. But, you owe me no|thing; I barely did my Duty.</P>
<P>O, my Friend, my Brother, my Pre&s;er|ver! I cried; I owe you more than Life. Exi&s;tence had been my greate&s;t of Cur&s;es, without you. That I am not, at this Mo|ment, the deepe&s;t damned of the Creati|on. That I find my&s;elf the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of all Beings. To you, alone, it is owing, my <HI>Longfield,</HI> my Deliverer! Nay, hope not to e&s;cape me; we, never more mu&s;t part. You are my Captive for Life. And I, and all that I am, or have, is your's to Eternity.</P>
<P>As the People, within and without, were &s;till in great Commotion, the Court appeared much alarmed; and the Judge, and mo&s;t of the Gentry, made homeward, through a private Door that opened into a back Alley. But, their Fears were ground|le&s;s. For the Croud was wholly intent on
<PB N="39" REF="38">another Object, and impatiently waited for a Sight of my <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;he walked forward, attended by Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> and my&s;elf, they made way, for her, on either Hand; and the Atmo&s;|phere again rung with Shouts and Accla|mations. So &s;incere is the Re&s;pect that the Populace pay to Virtue; and &s;uch is their Exultation when Innocence ri&s;es &s;u|perior to Oppre&s;&s;ion. But, when Inno|cence and Virtue are accompanied by Beauty, their Reverence grows almo&s;t cri|minal, and approaches to Adoration.</P>
<P>Thus we returned to <HI>Newgate,</HI> amid&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ings, Prayers, and Prai&s;es, of a yielding Multitude who, &s;till, re&s;pectfully opened as <HI>Arabella</HI> advanced. The Win|dows, on all Sides, poured forth Congra|tulations, and tho&s;e through whom we had pa&s;&s;ed, pre&s;&s;ed forward for another Sight, as though their Eyes could not be &s;atisfied with beholding.</P>
<P>Before we entered her late Pri&s;on, my Wife turned about, and curt&s;ied, three or four Times, to her numerous Attendants, with an acknowledging Grace and Humi|lity that &s;eemed oppre&s;&s;ed by their Favours. She then entered ha&s;tily and, running up Stairs, &s;he caught her Child from the Nur&s;ekeeper. She held him &s;ome Time
<PB N="40" REF="39">in her Arms; her Bo&s;om gently heaved; and the Tears rolled, in Silence, down her placid Countenance. But, on our Ap|proach, &s;he turned &s;uddenly into the Bed|chamber; &s;hut to the Door; and continu|ed there in private for near an Hour.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I &s;ent out for a warm Dinner and a Bottle of Wine. Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> now told me that he had, often, been tempted to introduce him&s;elf to us, during my Wife's Confinement; but, he feared that the Di&s;covery of any Acquain|tance or Corre&s;pondence, between us, might prejudice <HI>Arabella</HI> upon her Trial. And that, therefore, he had made u&s;e of the little Stratagem of the Ver&s;es, which he had thru&s;t under our Door, in order to pre&s;erve us from a total Depre&s;&s;ion of Spirits.</P>
<P>When the Cloth was laid; I whi&s;pered gently, through the Keyhole, to my <HI>Ara|bella;</HI> and &s;oon after &s;he came forth, with a Harmony and Beatitude of Motion and A&s;pect, as though &s;he had in&s;tantly drop|ped from that Heaven, which had wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her during her Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>At Table, Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> gave us &s;ome Heads of his Hi&s;tory. He further told us that, &s;ince the Death of his late Lord, he had entered into another Service; but that
<PB N="41" REF="40">he had been out of Place for about a Month pa&s;t. I have &s;aved, &s;ays he, about thirty Guineas of my Wages; but that is not the whole of my Trea&s;ure. This Morning, as I was ju&s;t upon entering the Court, a very comely Gentlewoman twitch|ed me by the Sleeve. She a&s;ked me if my Name was not <HI>Longfield,</HI> and if I was not one of the Witne&s;&s;es on the impending Trial? When I an&s;wered in the Affirma|tive, &s;he took me a little a&s;ide, and, put|ting ten Guineas into my Hand, keep up, &s;aid &s;he, to your Evidence, be zealous in avenging the Blood of your Lord, and this is not the la&s;t Gratification which you &s;hall receive.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e, I called up the Keeper, di&s;charged the Reckoning and Fees, and returned Thanks for his Civility and particular Re&s;pects to my <HI>Arabella.</HI> I then &s;ent for a Coach, and we drove Home together.</P>
<P>On the Way, I prevailed upon Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> to take up his Lodgings, at Mrs. <HI>Jennett</HI>'s; provided he could be accommo|dated, at a rea&s;onable Rate.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jennett</HI> received us, with warm Congratulations, we immediately ordered the Kettle down, and invited her to a Di&s;h of Tea; over which &s;he agreed with our
<PB N="42" REF="41">Friend, for the Street Room on the &s;ame Floor; at three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week.</P>
<P>The Day following, I left Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> to entertain my <HI>Arabella.</HI> I went to our late Landlord, and called him to an Ac|cout for the Furniture we had left in his Hou&s;e. Hereupon, he produced an In|ventory of Particulars, taken upon Oath, with the Bill of Apprai&s;ment and Sale, and returned me the Surplus, that remain|ed over the Rent, amounting to &s;omewhat upward of nine Pounds. <HI>Deborah,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;e, had carried off whatever was mo&s;t valuable and portable.</P>
<P>I then ha&s;tened to the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es,</HI> they received me with &s;uch Tran&s;ports as my Heart found to be unfeigned. They, already knew the happy Tidings. They huddled on &s;ome loo&s;e Matters; and away we tripped, together, with all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;patch.</P>
<P>The Meeting was accompanied by ma|ny tender and mutual Tears. Ah, my Love! cried the Elde&s;t of the Mi&s;s <HI>Hod|gin&s;es.</HI> Pride and Beauty of your Sex, how jealous we are of you! We went Ye&s;terday to your Trial, with the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial of our Friends, in order to give you a Character, if required; but, you
<PB N="43" REF="42">neither called upon us, nor would look on the Side where we &s;tood. Ah, my dear Girls, my &s;weet Friends! cried <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> how could I hope or imagine, that you would acknowledge or even think of &s;o low and lo&s;t a Wretch as I was.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> was now at Liberty to revi&s;it her old Acquaintance. She was care&s;&s;ed more than ever; and took in &s;o much Work that &s;he was obliged to hire a Girl to attend the Child.</P>
<P>I was now at the very Pinnacle of hu|man Happine&s;s. I had twenty Guineas left of the fifty I got from my Father. My Wife earned from two to her three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Day. And Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> who generally dieted with us, frequently brought Tea and Sugar, or a Bottle of Cordial, or &s;ome &s;uch Matter in his Pocket, which he pretended to have gotten exce&s;|&s;ively cheap, or as a Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Thus we lived, in a Kind of frugal Af|fluence. Affliction was no more. The Remembrance of Di&s;tre&s;s and Poverty had vani&s;hed, as a Dream. Our Days moved upon Down; and Joy and Peace, nightly prepared our Pillows.</P>
<P>Happy Days, happy Hours, above the Lot of Mortality! Heaven pre&s;erve me
<PB N="44" REF="43">from ever ta&s;ting the like again; le&s;t they al&s;o &s;hould be attended by &s;o terrible a Rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> was very lovely in his Per&s;on and Manners. He had made the Belles Letters his peculiar Study; and he u&s;ed to procure a Variety, of entertaining Novels and Memoirs, in <HI>French,</HI> which he read fluently into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> while my Wife was at Work. We had contracted a Friend&s;hip which I imagined too &s;trict for Time or Chance to untie; and I loved him the better for his Attention to my <HI>Arabella,</HI> who&s;e Entertaiment &s;eemed to form the chief Delight of his Life.</P>
<P>I gave him my Story, in Parts, from Time to Time; and he had plentifully watered the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages with his Tears. His own Experience had taught him to join, with Mr. <HI>Goodville,</HI> in think|ing that the Education, of a mere Scholar, was no way &s;uited to the common Occa&s;i|ons of Life. He, therefore, introduced me to Mr. <HI>Marfelt,</HI> his late Ma&s;ter, to whom he had recommended me as pri|vate Tutor to his Son; and we agreed at &pound;50 <HI>per Ann.</HI> to commence as &s;oon as the young Gentleman &s;hould de&s;cend from the Nur&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">
Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> as I told you, was very lovely in his Per&s;on; and he daily became more amiable and engaging in my Eyes. I was plea&s;ed that he appeared, in the &s;ame Light, to my Wife. She was in|debted to him for her Life, and, in her, I held my&s;elf indebted to him, for all Things. I thought that we could never love him enough; and I, daily and night|ly, importuned my <HI>Arabella,</HI> to affect him with a Tenderne&s;s equal to my own.</P>
<P>At length I became unea&s;y, I knew not why, nor wherefore. I grew diffident at the Compari&s;on which I made in my Mind between <HI>Longfield</HI> and my&s;elf, and I was di&s;gu&s;ted, as it were, with my own De|merits, wherefore, I grew dejected and di&s;pirited, and yet affected to appear the rever&s;e of what I was. I however &s;ighed in &s;ecret. When I could form a Pretence for retiring or going abroad, I took a &s;oli|tary Walk or withdrew to &s;ome Rece&s;s, where I lightened my Oppre&s;&s;ion by a loo&s;e to my Tears; and I was thereby the better enabled to &s;eem chearful, on my Return, and to a&s;&s;ume a Face of Gaiety that was foreign to my Heart. Ah! are not the real Evils of Life &s;ufficient? Yet Man adds to the Heap by his tendency to realize what is merely imaginary.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45">
The Source of my Malady was now no longer a Secret to me. My <HI>Longfield,</HI> I cried to my&s;elf, my <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Angel, you are &s;till faithful my <HI>Longfield,</HI> you are &s;till cha&s;te my <HI>Arabella;</HI> and there is no|thing, wherewith I can reproach the one, or the other. But you are, both of ye, too amiable; you are fitted for each-other. Your <HI>Clement</HI> loves ye too well to be a Bar to your Happine&s;s. You Two are the whole Trea&s;ure and Delight of his Exi&s;t|ence. He will have no Bli&s;s but your's; your Happine&s;s &s;hall be his; and he will die to accompli&s;h it; &s;ince his Life is an Interruption.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ed that I daily declined; but the Affectation of Chearfulne&s;s became irk&s;ome and painful to me. One Night, as we &s;at together, my Wife looked at me, with an affectionate Di&s;turbance; what is the Matter, <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;he cried. What is come over my Love? You look not, you &s;peak not, like the once fond, the delighting and delighted Con&s;ort of your <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>Ah, I cried, it is enough. I die, and I die contented, &s;ince I leave the only two happy, for whom I could wi&s;h to live. What is this I hear, <HI>Hammy?</HI> replied my <HI>Arabella;</HI> you die, you &s;ay, and you &s;ay,
<PB N="47" REF="46">al&s;o, that you die contented. Ah!&mdash;You love me no longer; what Bu&s;ine&s;s have I, then, any longer to &mdash; live, &s;he would have &s;aid, but &s;he, in&s;tantly, &s;wooned.</P>
<P>My Eyes were &s;uddenly opened. I cur&s;ed my infatuating Jealou&s;y. I wi&s;hed for in&s;tant Death to rid me of my Confu|&s;ion. Neither did I dare to look up into the Face of my injured Friend, who by this as I feared, had di&s;covered my Folly; and who, all trembling and pale as Death, was a&s;&s;iduous in helping to the Recovery of my Wife.</P>
<P>At length &s;he opened her Eyes, and, looking about with a languid kind of Di&s;|plea&s;ure, Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, your Services have been great; but, at pre&s;ent, I am not under any Nece&s;&s;ity for your A&s;&s;i&s;tance; whereupon, he, &s;ilently, bowed and withdrew to his Apartment.</P>
<P>I then dropped on my Knees before her. My <HI>Arabella,</HI> my Angel, I cried. Lovelie&s;t of Womankind, mo&s;t con&s;ummate of human Creatures! &mdash; But, here, with a forbidding Hand, and a Countenance a|verted, no <HI>Hammy,</HI> no, &s;ays &s;he, (in a Voice interrupted by Tears,) after what has pa&s;&s;ed your Lips, I cannot be deceiv|ed, and I will not be comforted. You would leave me you &s;ay, <HI>Hammy,</HI> and you
<PB N="48" REF="47">would leave me forlorn. But, I will not be for&s;aken, I will prevent your Unkind|ne&s;s. I will go where I &s;hall not be alto|gether friendle&s;s. Ah, my Aunt! my all Relations in One, why did you abandon me? You thought you left me the World, in this Hu&s;band, this Friend and Protec|tor, as you called him. But he &s;ays he is contented to part, and he bids me be happy without him. I come then, my dear Aunt; I will rejoin you, my beloved Pa|rent; you will take your for&s;aken <HI>Arabella</HI> to your Bo&s;om. You will comfort her, the be&s;t you can; and we will part no more.</P>
<P>Here, her Words were &s;uffocated by Sobs and a Bur&s;t of Affliction. But, &s;till continuing my Po&s;ture, I am guilty, my Love, I cried, I am guilty pa&s;t Pardon. Alas, you have been wedded to Weakne&s;s and Frailty, ill de&s;erving of Purity and Perfection like yours. But, I will live, if you de&s;ire it, my <HI>Arabella;</HI> I will live, to repent my Follies, and to repair my De|faults. But I cannot, a Minute longer, &s;urvive your Di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She, then beckoned me to ri&s;e, and &s;it be&s;ide her, which I did; when, reaching one Arm about my Neck, and gently leaning over, &s;he joined her Face to mine,
<PB N="49" REF="48">and &s;ilently &s;hed her Sorrows into my Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Soon after, I perceived that &s;he was &s;eized with a kind of &s;hivering; and, call|ing to the Girl, I ordered her, in all Ha&s;te, to warm the Bed, and I a&s;&s;i&s;ted my Wife directly to undre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he lay down, and was &s;ome|what compo&s;ed, I &s;tepped to my Friend's Apartment. I found him leaning on a Table, with his Eyes downca&s;t, like the Image of Di&s;comfort &s;tooping over a Mo|nument. What is the Matter, I &s;aid, what ails my dear <HI>Longfield?</HI> I hope I have not offended him pa&s;t Forgivene&s;s. Indeed, I am not well, &s;ays he. Heav'ns, what an Overca&s;ting! of &s;uch a Sun&s;hine, too! Do not look at me, <HI>Hammy,</HI> I can't bear to be looked at. I be&s;eech you to leave me to my own Thoughts, till Morn|ing. I under&s;tand you, Mr. <HI>Longfield,</HI> I cried, I confe&s;s my&s;elf no longer worthy of your Friend&s;hip, and I &s;hall no more demand it of you, till you conde&s;cend to make the Tender; and, &s;o &s;aying, I &s;ud|denly quitted his Chamber.</P>
<P>All Night, my <HI>Arabella</HI> was cold and hot, by Turns; and her Sleep was di&s;|compo&s;ed by Starts and Moanings. In the Morning, I ob&s;erved that her Breath
<PB N="50" REF="49">was &s;hort and feveri&s;h, and I got up, in ha&s;te, and went for a Phy&s;ician. The Doctor refu&s;ed to pronounce, with Cer|tainty, on her Di&s;order; but &s;aid that he greatly feared &s;he was taking an Ague.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had written his Pre&s;crip|tion, I went, eagerly, to wi&s;h Mr. <HI>Long|field</HI> a good Morning, and to apologize for the Abruptne&s;s of la&s;t Night's Behaviour. But, my <HI>Longfield</HI> had taken a long Adieu, and this Letter, which I &s;hall ever pre|&s;erve about me, was all I had left to con|&s;ole me for his Lo&s;s; or, rather, to give me Cau&s;e to lament his Departure, for ever.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>H. Clement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Leave you, deare&s;t of Friends, and I leave you for ever. Wretch that I am to have brought Affliction on the only Two for whom I would have lived, for whom I would have died.</P>
<P>Heavens, what a Fate is mine! I vo|luntarily depart, and I go where I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, &s;ince I leave tho&s;e who&s;e Sight and Conver&s;e made the Whole of my Enjoyment. That which doubles my Unhappine&s;s is partly to &s;u&s;pect that I have been guilty; is it any Alleviati|on, that I had no Knowledge of my
<PB N="51" REF="50">Fault; and that I now fly from it, on the fir&s;t Notice?</P>
<P>Your <HI>Arabella,</HI> my <HI>Hammy,</HI> I begin to fear that I loved your <HI>Arabella.</HI> Alas! I, feel that I &s;till love her, and that I mu&s;t love her during Life. I loved her, indeed, with a Tenderne&s;s full of infinite Re&s;pect; but the Pangs I &s;uffer, at Parting, give me, al&s;o, to under&s;tand that I loved her with infi|nite Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ah, fond and fooli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion! that could neither hope, nor wi&s;h, nor even accept of any Kind of Gratification, &s;ave the Sight and Society of the Object of its Ardour. No, mo&s;t amiable of Men! were it po&s;&s;ible for your <HI>Arabella</HI> to &s;tray, but in Thought from her Truth, from her Duty, from her Tenderne&s;s to you, I could have loved her no lon|ger. She would have lo&s;t that Seraphic Excellence, that more than mortal Pu|rity, for which I almo&s;t adored her; which gave a &s;weet Apology to my Heart for its Affection; and betrayed me into a Per&s;ua&s;ion that I loved her no more than I ought.</P>
<P>I am jealous for you, my Friend, I am jealous of my&s;elf, in your dearer Behalf;
<PB N="52" REF="51">and I will amply avenge you on the in|jurious and haple&s;s <HI>Longfield.</HI></P>
<P>Ah, let no Man henceforward, con|fide to his own Strength. I daily be|held your <HI>Arabella;</HI> I daily conver&s;ed with her; but I &s;aw not my Danger; I, therefore, did not re&s;i&s;t the Current that drew me beyond my Depth. The Gracefullne&s;s of her Motions, the Sound of her Voice, and the Loveline&s;s of her A&s;pect, hourly &s;unk upon my Soul, with an intoxicating Delight; and I wi&s;hed, and was &s;olicitous to become plea&s;ing in her Eyes, at the Time that I would have taken the Life of any Man, who had attempted to deprive you of your &s;malle&s;t Right in her Af|fections.</P>
<P>My Confe&s;&s;ion has been full, and reaches the utmo&s;t of my Faults; but, from what a Dream of Delight has it &s;uddenly awaked me! How ble&s;&s;ed have I been with my <HI>Hammy</HI> and his <HI>Ara|bella!</HI> how happy were we in each|other, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the Lot of Mortality! Enchanting Sen&s;ations! Ye are departed for ever; and all the future Portion, that ye leave me, is Bitterne&s;s.</P>
<P>But, beware of one Thing, I con|jure you, beware, that you never reveal
<PB N="53" REF="52">the &s;malle&s;t Hint of my Love, to your <HI>Arabella.</HI> Wound not her Delicacy, I be&s;eech you, with &s;o di&s;gu&s;tful a Recol|lection. Neither deprive your unhappy Friend of the only Con&s;olation that now is left him; an innocent, tho' fond Hope, that, &s;hould &s;he ever remember your <HI>Longfield,</HI> it may not be with De|te&s;tation.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. In the Drawer of my Table, on the left Hand, you will find a no-Paper, carefully &s;ealed, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed to you. It contains a poor Legacy, though all that could be bequeathed by</P>
</POSTSCRIPT>
<SIGNED>Your departed,
<HI>Ed. Longfield.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I wept, as I read this pathetic Epi&s;tle. I felt all the Pa&s;&s;ion and Angui&s;h of my Friend. My Brea&s;t heaved and was agi|tated with Emotions of Self-Reproach, and with a Tide of returning Tenderne&s;s to my <HI>Longfield.</HI></P>
<P>Ah, unju&s;t, tho' mo&s;t generous of Men, I exclaimed, I alone am guilty, and thou a&s;&s;ume&s;t to thy&s;elf a Burden that thy Virtue di&s;claims. Would to Heaven that
<PB N="54" REF="53">Men, and Angels, might love my <HI>Arabella</HI> with a Purity like thine; &s;he would not then, as now, be wholly dependent, on my &s;ole and poor Guardian&s;hip, for the Defence of her Innocence.</P>
<P>I found &s;eventeen Guineas, in the fore|mentioned Paper; a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable, and yet a mo&s;t unacceptable Supply, as I fear|ed, from the Genero&s;ity of my <HI>Longfield</HI>'s Temper, that it contained very nearly the whole of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>As the Doctor had conjectured; my Wife's Di&s;temper turned out a tertian Ague; and, after exhau&s;ting the Circle of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> toward a Cure; the Dregs of the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;ettled into a Rheu|mati&s;m, that principally affected her Arms and Hands, and thereby prevented her from earning any Sub&s;i&s;tance for her&s;elf or her Infant.</P>
<P>It was now upward of four Months, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Longfield</HI> had left us; during all which Time, I hardly ever departed from the Side of my <HI>Arabella.</HI> Our Finances were again reduced to about two Guineas, and this was not &s;ufficient to di&s;charge our &s;ixth Quarter, that had been due &s;ome Time. I was, however, confident of a Supply in the Tutor&s;hip, promi&s;ed me by
<PB N="55" REF="54">Mr. <HI>Marfelt;</HI> and I dre&s;&s;ed, in the be&s;t I could, and waited upon him.</P>
<P>I was concerned to find the Family in Black. But, when Mr. <HI>Marfelt</HI> him&s;elf appeared, and told me, with a Voice in|terrupted by Sighs, that his only Son, my Pupil in Expectance, had been lately carried off by a malignant Small-Pox, my Mourning pa&s;&s;ed all Shews and Suits of Sorrow.</P>
<P>I took my Leave, with a Dejection and Ab&s;ence of Mind, that forgot there was any Road left for me upon Earth. I went, I knew not where, a Way that led from Home. I &s;aw nothing but the Labyrinth within my own Soul; and, from thence I could perceive neither Outlet nor E&s;cape.</P>
<P>Rapines and Robberies, again offered them&s;elves to my View, as the only Expe|dients, by which Heaven had ordained, that my Wife and my Infant, that Virtue and Innocence &s;hould be permitted to live. Nature has ca&s;t my Lot, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, among Tygers and Vultures, who have no Choice, &s;ave to peri&s;h, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t by Prey. I dwelt, long, on this Thought; and then pu&s;hed it to Extremity, and the Perpetra|tion of de&s;perate Deeds. Again, the Stretch of my Re&s;olution began to relax; and the Tide of my Thoughts flowed
<PB N="56" REF="55">backward to the Sen&s;ations and Meltings of Humanity. Ah, I cried, my fellow-Creatures; you, in whom I &s;ee my&s;elf; my Brothers, in who&s;e Service I would gladly &s;pend my Life; pardon me, that I take from you what I would give you, twenty fold. Or, rather, powerful Author of Nature! I cried, take from us our Ex|i&s;tence, &s;ince thou refu&s;e&s;t the Means whereby we may exi&s;t!</P>
<P>My Eyes at la&s;t were opened, and I perceived that I was now much further from my Lodgings than when I &s;et out from Mr. <HI>Marfelt</HI>'s. I turned homeward, as well as I could, fatigued in Body, and with more than a Mountain's Weight up|on my Mind. On the Way, I lifted my Eyes, and wrung my Hands together, in a Kind of Agony; Bread, Bread! I cried inwardly, merciful Heaven, a little, but a very little Bread! my helple&s;s Wife, my helple&s;s Infant! a little Pittance for them, I crave it, in Mercy! and, O, &s;ave me from more than the Torments of the damned, from beholding them fami&s;hed, and ga&s;ping for a Mor&s;el of Su&s;tenance before my Face.</P>
<P>I looked round, and beheld nothing but Scenes of Luxury or Plenty; with Joy, Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Content, vi&s;ible in the Coun|tenance of the Meane&s;t. Ah, what is
<PB N="57" REF="56">here? &s;aid I to my&s;elf, Powerful Being, how partial are thy Di&s;pen&s;ations! How highly are tho&s;e exalted; to what a Depth do&s;t thou cru&s;h the Wretch whom thy Wrath has di&s;tingui&s;hed! I am &s;elected from among thy Works. I am, equally, the Outca&s;t of Heaven and of Earth. Might I become, but as one of yonder Beggars, I &s;hould derive a chance Mor&s;el from that Charity, which now hardens it|&s;elf again&s;t me, again&s;t my Babe, and my <HI>Arabella,</HI> the mo&s;t pitiable Objects of the Creation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had crawled Home, ano|ther Weight was added to the Burden I already bore. A Bailiff was in Waiting; and my Landlady, with an A&s;pect as in|exorable as Iron, ordered me directly into Cu&s;tody for the la&s;t Quarter's Rent.</P>
<P>I was, on this Occa&s;ion, obliged to di&s;|bur&s;e my la&s;t two Guineas, and further to depo&s;it my Wife's Gown, as a Security for the &s;mall Remainder of Rent and Cap|tion Fees. I had not, now, wherewithal to purcha&s;e a Pennyworth of Bread, that, like the Widow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> my Wife, my Child, and I, for this la&s;t Time, might &s;it down together and eat, before we died.</P>
<P>Thus abandoned of every Hope, divine or human, I did not dare to turn my Eye,
<PB N="58" REF="57">to borrow Patience, or Con&s;olation, from the Countenance of the Saint to whom I was united. I pretended to have forgot|ten &s;omewhat, and again, ha&s;tened out of Doors. The Night had ju&s;t fallen, and was &s;till and gloomy. Rage, Angui&s;h, and De&s;pair gave me new Strength and Spirits; and I turned, fiercely, down an unfrequented Street, without any Arms, &s;ave my Fury and natural Phangs, with which I determined, like the maternal Li|one&s;s, to rend Sub&s;i&s;tance, for my Young, from the fir&s;t I &s;hould encounter.</P>
<P>I perceived a Man advancing, at &s;ome Di&s;tance. I ha&s;tened to meet him, and, coming within a few Paces, &s;tand! I cried, pa&s;s no further! Why, &s;aid he, with a fearle&s;s and benevolent Voice, is there any Thing wherein you de&s;ire I &s;hould &s;erve you? Oh, &s;ave me! I replied, you mu&s;t, you &s;hall &s;ave me from the terrible Dam|nation of &s;eeing my Wife and Infant fa|mi&s;h before me. GOD, &s;aid he, &s;ends you this, by my Hands. He &s;ees your Di&s;tre&s;s, but di&s;approves your Conduct. You have now twice &s;inned in this Way. But, <HI>Clement,</HI> beware the third Time; another Offence like this would prove fatal to you.</P>
<P>He &s;poke, and, putting five Guineas into my Hand, he in&s;tantly &s;lipped away
<PB N="59" REF="58">or vani&s;hed, I know not which; for, &s;uch was my &s;udden A&s;toni&s;hment and Confu|&s;ion, that I neither remarked nor &s;aw what became of him.</P>
<P>At length, I awaked, as from a Trance. I &s;tepped up to a &s;ingle Lamp that glim|mer'd before me; and, opening my Hand, I perceived that the Money which I held was Gold. I hurried it into my Pocket; and turning back, I began, &s;low and pen|&s;ative, to move toward Home. The Fu|ry with which I was, &s;o lately, exa&s;pera|ted again&s;t Heaven and Earth, again &s;ub|&s;ided; and my Heart began to change from that of a Tyger, and to feel a new Infu&s;ion of Compunction and Humanity.</P>
<P>Ah, I cried, I am then known. The Darkne&s;s of the Night hath not been able to conceal me. My Guilt is laid open be|fore God and his Angels; and my pre&s;ent and pa&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are entered in his Book. He yet pities, he yet relieves me. He &s;natches me from the Gulph, wherein I had already plunged and &s;aw no Bottom; to &s;hew me that no Extremity can pa&s;s his Power; and that, on this Side of Exi&s;t|ence, it is always too early to de&s;pair of his Bounty. I will, then, be patient, O my GOD! I will no more repine nor kick again&s;t thy Di&s;pen&s;ations. It is &s;ufficient that I &s;tand within thy continued Notice.
<PB N="60" REF="59">This la&s;t In&s;tance of thy Goodne&s;s! it is enough, it is enough! I de&s;ire no further Proof of thy Providence or Regard; and, tho' thou kill me, I will tru&s;t in thee, to the late&s;t Ga&s;p. But, for me it matters not how thou plea&s;e&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of me. I will &s;urrender to thee that which is infi|nitely more dear. I confide to thee my Wife and Child. O, that thou did&s;t love them with a Love like mine! But, they are thine, as I am thine; and if they pe|ri&s;h before my Eyes, why, let them pe|ri&s;h. We were, all, born to peri&s;h before the Eyes of our Heavenly Father; and he may &s;lay, without Compunction; who can revive, at his Plea&s;ure; who would not, perhaps, &s;lay us, if it were not to revive us to a better Life; to a Life that &s;hall, no more, be acquainted with Calamity.</P>
<P>Before I reached Home, a &s;udden Faint|i&s;hne&s;s came over me, and, turning into a Dram-Shop, I called for a Quartern, and changed a Guinea. If the other four Gui|neas, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, are made of aethe|rial Money, I have, however, got &s;ome|thing &s;ub&s;tantial, to &s;upply my little <HI>Tommy</HI> and my dearer <HI>Arabella</HI> with a Mor&s;el of Bread.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I got to my Lodgings, I re|deemed my Wife's Gown, and &s;ent out
<PB N="61" REF="60">for a frugal Supper. I, then, &s;tepped up Stairs, and, taking a Chair, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to my Wife, I &s;at down and continued &s;i|lent, but dared not to look up. She eyed me, through and through. My <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, you are apt to meet with &s;trange Adventures, in very &s;hort Spaces of Time. I know you not for the &s;ame Per&s;on; you are not what you were a few Minutes ago.</P>
<P>I, then, found my&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;i|ty of openly avowing to her all that had happened. But, gracious Heaven! to my Death, through Time, and through Eter|nity, never &s;hall I forget the Reply &s;he made.</P>
<P><HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, with the Face, Air and Accent of Heaven's milde&s;t Mini&s;ter, it ill becomes me to reprove a re&s;pected Hu&s;|band for the Exce&s;s of his Goodne&s;s to me and my Child; and yet, I have &s;uffered more from the Con&s;ideration of this Ex|ce&s;s, than from all our other Trials and Calamities put together. I love you in|tirely my <HI>Hammy,</HI> but I love that Part of you mo&s;t, which you appear to regard the lea&s;t; it is a Part that mu&s;t &s;urvive the Di&s;&s;olution of all the Re&s;t, their &s;hort Joys, their idle Anxieties, their fierce De&s;ires, and empty Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and it mu&s;t there|after, be your&s;elf, to all Eternity.</P>

When a Man is bound on a Voyage to &s;ome di&s;tant Region, he fails not to en|quire into the Length and Dangers of the Way; the Nature of the Climate; the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Inhabitants; what Food they &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon; and what Sort of Goods chiefly, bear a Price or Value in &s;o remote a Country. With &s;uch Goods, alone, a wi&s;e Voyager will load his Ve&s;&s;el; nay, he will be careful to make and tran&s;mit Lodgments, before he &s;ets out; as al&s;o, to form and e&s;tabli&s;h previous Friend&s;hips in that Country, that he may not be reject|ed, as one unknown and unregarded, when he happens to arrive. Ah, my Hu&s;band, I will not adventure to a&s;k what Enquiries, and Provi&s;ions, you have made for the great Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I once thought, my Love, that Learn|ing was the principal Promoter of Piety; as it be&s;t taught the Nature of God and Man; their Relations to Each-other, and the con&s;equent Duties of the Creature to his Creator. But I have, long &s;ince, di&s;|covered that, to <HI>know,</HI> is not to <HI>feel;</HI> and that <HI>Argument</HI> and <HI>Inclination</HI> are, often, as oppo&s;ite, as Adver&s;aries that refu&s;e all Means of Reconcilement.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e you, for In&s;tance, in the Depth of your Knowledge and Extent of
<PB N="63" REF="62">your Genius, the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive of all Creatures, and the wide&s;t Di&s;coverer of the Attributes of Infinity. But what will this do for you, my <HI>Hammy?</HI> You may contemplate the&s;e great Objects, as Mat|ters with which you are no way connected. You may yet repine, and cur&s;e, in &s;ecret, the particular Di&s;pen&s;ations of that Provi|dence; who&s;e general Wi&s;dom and Pro|priety your Philo&s;ophy admits.</P>
<P>GOD, with all his Omnipotence, can, no otherwi&s;e, make his Image in our Hu|manity happy, than by connecting us with him&s;elf; &s;ince from Him we derive our Exi&s;tence, and in Him that Exi&s;tence can alone be continued. And this Connection can no Way be formed, but by our De|pendence upon Him. And this Depen|dence can, no way be made, but, by our Confidence in Him; by feeling that, in our&s;elves or the World around us, there is neither Footing nor Hold to &s;ave from finking for ever; and by catching at God alone for the Support of that Exi&s;tence which his Bounty be&s;towed.</P>
<P>It is this Confidence, my dear Hu&s;band, which is called by the Name of FAITH, throughout the Go&s;pel; which &s;trengthens all Weakne&s;&s;es; which heals all Di&s;ea&s;es; which enlightens all Blindne&s;s; which may be capable of Omnipotence, by its Con|nection
<PB N="64" REF="63">with God; and, in his Power, can perform all Manner of Wonders. At lea&s;t, <HI>Hammy,</HI> we ought to have &s;uch a Portion, of this Faith, as might enable us to &s;ay, to the Wor&s;t that can befal, what the three <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Captives &s;aid to the King of <HI>A&s;&s;yria; Our God is able to deliver us, and he will, in Time, deliver us from all the&s;e Afflictions. But, though he &s;hould not deliver us; we will not for&s;ake our Hold and our Confidence in him; neither bow to any Temp|tation that Guilt can &s;et up.</HI></P>
<P>From the Beginning to this Day, the World has ever proved a Traitor to tho&s;e who tru&s;ted in it. And O, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> that you would join with me, in looking only to the Principle, from whence Salva|tion can come to a poor and impotent Creature. For all Creatures, are poor and impotent in them&s;elves. Even the Cheru|bim and Seraphim, the mightie&s;t and mo&s;t exlated of the Works of Omnipo|tence, would be reduced to a State of No|thingne&s;s by an Independence on their Creator.</P>
<P>Since God, therefore, cannot communi|cate Happine&s;s to a Being, who refu&s;es to tru&s;t in his Goodne&s;s, or to repo&s;e upon his Power; where he is peculiarly favour|able, and determines to take a faithle&s;s tho' beloved Creature to him&s;elf; he ble&s;&s;es
<PB N="65" REF="64">him with all Sorts of Cro&s;&s;es and Di&s;ap|pointments. He breaks, under him, all the Props of Worldly Confidence. He &s;natches from him the Helps, on which his Hope had laid hold. That, in the In|&s;tant of &s;inking, he may finally compel him to catch at his Creator; and to throw him&s;elf on the Bo&s;om, of that infinite Be|nevolence, which is de&s;irous of receiving him to everla&s;ting Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to reflect, my Love, how af|fectionately &s;olicitous (if I may venture to &s;ay &s;o) your Saviour has been to win you to him&s;elf. He has left you, by Turns, to the Confidence, of a Variety of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing E&s;tabli&s;hments. As fir&s;t, in the Succe&s;s of your own Talents, when they acquired you as much, weekly, as might &s;ub&s;i&s;t you, for a Year. Again, when you had all the Right, that Man could have, to rely on the Honour, and even the Intere&s;ts of the Government, for whom you were &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly and profit|ably engaged. And again, in the Ren|counter and Pre&s;ervation of your Father, on whom Nature, and your own Merits had, further, given you an indefei&s;ible Title, and Foundation for Dependence. But, you may remember, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> that your God caught all the&s;e, and all other the like Pillars, as &s;uddenly from under you, as though they had been in|&s;tantly
<PB N="66" REF="65">changed to a Void. And yet, you did not appear, at tho&s;e Times, to di&s;cern, that it was no other than your heavenly Father, and your heavenly Friend, who contrived, by &s;uch Cro&s;&s;es, to wean you from Impotence; and to woo and to win you, from your Court&s;hip of a Cloud, to an Affiance with e&s;&s;ential and infinite Beauty.</P>
<P>I am your loving, and humble Wife, my Hu&s;band. And this is your dear and promi&s;ing Infant. But, what are we fur|ther to you? You neither made us, nor can you pre&s;erve us; nor are you obliged to provide for us, beyond your weak and finite Endeavours. Commit us then to him, in whom we have our Exi&s;tence; and know that, &s;hould he permit this In|nocent to &s;uffer, and my Confidence in his Mercy to fail of Support; the Retribution is in&s;tantly, and infinitely in his Hands, and his Exce&s;s will even con&s;i&s;t in the Overflowings of his Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I love you, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> too much; too inten&s;ely, for my own Peace here; I will &s;ay nothing of my Intere&s;ts in an eternal hereafter. And yet, my Darling, were it put to my Choice, I would rather fami&s;h, with you from Hour to Hour, and Day to Day; provided you peri&s;hed content and re&s;igned, and in a ble&s;&s;ed Conformity
<PB N="67" REF="66">to the Will of your Creator; than to en|joy, in Conjunction with you, for a Mil|lion of Ages, all that this World can be|&s;tow, till its Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Here ended my <HI>Arabella,</HI> but the Sweetne&s;s of her Voice continued to vi|brate in my Ear; like the Tone of a fine tuned Harp, when the Finger has cea&s;ed to touch the &s;ounding Strings.</P>
<P>She had, opportunely, laid hold of the Sea&s;on for making the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;he de|&s;ired; as my Mind was &s;till affected and &s;oftened by the late Adventure. I did not indeed, yet, behold the World or its Au|thor in the Light, by which they are re|pre&s;ented, in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, but, even in the Eye of Philo&s;ophy, all that my Wife had &s;aid appeared rea&s;onable, and right, and conformable to the Nature of a Being infinitely powerful, benevolent, and wi&s;e. Here was a PRINCIPLE, without who&s;e continued Will and Opera|tion, no one Thing, in the Univer&s;e, could either begin, or continue to exi&s;t; and as all Things in that Univer&s;e, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity depend upon him, he had of nece&s;&s;ity an equal Claim to their Confidence in him. I reflected, indeed, that he had hitherto permitted much, of Evil, to in|termingle with the Beauties, both of ma|terial and moral Nature; but this I held
<PB N="68" REF="67">to be well accounted for, if we con&s;idered him as a Being who cho&s;e to Work by Progre&s;&s;ion; as fir&s;t, by producing a Chaos out of Nothing; and again, by pro|ducing the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem out of Chaos; and la&s;tly, by preparing the pre&s;ent Sy&s;|tem for a final State of unchangeable and con&s;ummate Perfection. I, therefore held it incumbent to bear the Brui&s;ings of Mortality, with Content and Thankful|ne&s;s; as a Matter previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to our future Sublimation. Even, as the coar&s;e Earth of <HI>China,</HI> mu&s;t be cru&s;hed, and pounded to Powder, before it can ob|tain that Purity and Con&s;i&s;tence, which renders it capable of the final Poli&s;h and Beauty.</P>
<P>I am apt, Sir, to think, that there are very few Men, who do not, at different Times, behold the World, and its Crea|tor, in very different Lights; according to the different Events, with which they are affected; or according to the different Tempers, which a Change of Con&s;titution will, frequently, produce. If a Man is in Health, and finds Succe&s;&s;es coming upon him from &s;everal Quarters; all is Summer, all is Sun&s;hine, he &s;ees nothing but a de|lightful World, and a wi&s;e and benevolent Di&s;po&s;er thereof. He feels no Want, he perceives nothing ami&s;s; and therefore
<PB N="69" REF="68">thinks that all is full, and that all is right. In the very next Hour, let the very &s;ame Man be but cro&s;&s;ed in his Fortunes, or di&s;tempered in his Blood; and his Uni|ver&s;e &s;hall be covered with a &s;udden Gloom; the World, which he now be|holds, &s;hall be crouded with Objects of Wretchedne&s;s; divine Providence &s;hall ap|pear to him, as a daemoniac Di&s;pen&s;ation of all kinds of Evil. And, though he may not dare to &s;ay, he will &s;ecretly think, that, if he had the Formation and order|ing of Nature, he would, never have had the Malevolence to fill it with Tempe&s;ts, Earth-quakes, Inclemencies; Plagues, Pe&s;|tilences, Famines; Tumults, Wars, De|va&s;tations; Strifes, Violences, Murders; Griefs, Lo&s;&s;es, Calamities; Rage, Vexati|ons, Di&s;appointments; Pains, Di&s;ea&s;es, and Deaths.</P>
<P>Again Sir, I am apt to think, that there are very few Men, who do not depend upon this World for Happine&s;s; as our fir&s;t Parents depended on a Tree, a mere Piece of vegetable Wood, for the Con|ferring of Wi&s;dom and Divinity upon them. They will tell you, indeed, that human Life is &s;hort; that even that &s;hort Term is hourly determinable, by a thou|&s;and trifling Accidents; that it is &s;ubject to a Number of unavoidable Calamities; that all its Joys are tran&s;ient, and ever
<PB N="70" REF="69">followed by a weighty rever&s;e of Pain; and that, even, its be&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are at|tended by Cares that overbalance their Va|lue. They &s;ay true, but, to what Pur|po&s;e? They regret that Things are &s;o, without learning to prize them the le&s;s; and they repine at the Mi&s;eries that are in|cident to Mortality, as it were, at a Di&s;|temper for which, however, they never think of providing a Remedy. They tell you, that the World is a broken Staff, yet they &s;till lean upon it; they cur&s;e it, and, yet, cling to it as to their only Ble&s;|&s;ing. And thus, Sir, it is mo&s;t likely, that, from the Beginning of Things, to their final Di&s;&s;olution, each Man will be &s;eeking, on Earth, for a Happine&s;s, to which no other Per&s;on could ever attain. It is a Happine&s;s for which the immortal Soul is athir&s;t, and, though &s;he finds the whole World no better than an empty Ve&s;&s;el, &s;he is never tired of her Trials and endeavours to drink.</P>
<P>This however was not, altogether, the Ca&s;e between the World and me, at this Period. I had been &s;o brui&s;ed and buffeted and treated with &s;uch Severity, and Bitter|ne&s;s, by it; that I neither looked nor wi&s;hed for any Advantage from it. I, therefore, ca&s;t about for &s;ome kinder Sup|port; and I &s;aid, to my&s;elf, as the be&s;t Lover of earthly Happine&s;s may &s;ay with
<PB N="71" REF="70">great Truth; if there is not another State, to which this Sy&s;tem of Things is merely preparatory; if there is not &s;ome infinite Good to be derived from this World of multiplied Evils; the Author thereof mu&s;t have been &s;ome very malevolent or very petulent Being, who delights in the Mi&s;ery and Angui&s;h of others; or makes Sport of the Wretchedne&s;s of the Creatures of his Power. Neither can Angels or Men, In|vention or Rea&s;on, any otherwi&s;e account for the pre&s;ent calamitous State of mortal Nature.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Sentiments, I eagerly applyed, for further In&s;truction, to tho&s;e Writings that had brought Life and Immortality to Light. I began at the Creation, and pro|ceeded with the deepe&s;t Attention and Delight. Again, another Sy&s;tem of Mat|ter and Morals, another World and ano|ther God pre&s;ented them&s;elves before me. But I &s;hall not, here, detain you with an Account of my new Faith, as I may ju&s;tly call it. For, though I always had held my&s;elf, vulgarly &s;peaking, a Chri&s;tian; I found, on Examination, that I had been wholly a Stranger to the Nece&s;&s;ity; as well as Beauty, of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation; neither had I felt a &s;ingle Ray of its com|forting Influence.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="71">
My Wife began now to recover of her Rhumati&s;m, and hoped &s;oon, again, to be able to take in Work. I determined however to be beforehand with her, if po&s;&s;ible; for, at this Time, I regarded not how mean or humiliating my Occupa|tion would be, provided I might earn any kind of lawful and hone&s;t Bread.</P>
<P>Accordingly, as I rambled in Search of &s;uch Employment, I ob&s;erved a Porter, attending before the Door of a Tavern, clad in an ordinary Frock, with a Belt about his Wa&s;te, and an Apron before him. I thereupon went to <HI>Monmouth Street,</HI> and purcha&s;ed a Uniform for the like Purpo&s;e. I then pa&s;&s;ed through &s;eve|ral Streets, till I came to a &s;plendid Ta|vern, where no Porter was in Waiting. I &s;tepped over the Way, where I depo|&s;ited my former Coat with a poor Huck|&s;ter-Woman, to whom I promi&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall Matter for the Trouble I gave her. I then dre&s;&s;ed in my porterly Robes, and, applying to the chief Drawer, I promi&s;ed him Part of my Earnings, provided he put me into &s;peedy Employment.</P>
<P>I had not &s;tayed long, till I was di&s;|patched to a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance with a Letter. I was afterwards &s;ent on a Varie|ty of Errands and Me&s;&s;ages; and, by the
<PB N="73" REF="72">Clo&s;e of the Day, I had accumulated three Shillings; &s;ix Pence whereof I gave to the Drawer. I then &s;tep'd, in high Triumph to my Friend, the Huck&s;ter Woman. I gave her two Pence; rea&s;&s;umed my for|mer Garb; and left my Weeds in her Cu&s;tody. I returned Home, with a Sati&s;|faction, to which I had been a Stranger of a long Time; and I, that Night, eat heartily, talked chearfully, and &s;lept in Peace.</P>
<P>I continued this Occupation, during five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Days, in one of which I earned to the Amount of five Shillings.</P>
<P>It is &s;ure that, laying per&s;onal Pain and the &s;ocial Feelings apart, human Happi|ne&s;s does not, in any Way, depend on the Degrees of Station or Fortune, or on any ex|ternal Circum&s;tance whatever. It is mere|ly dome&s;tic; it is wholly imbo&s;omed, and cannot live from Home. I was, now, en|gaged in one of the lowe&s;t and lea&s;t lucra|tive Employments of Life; but a DIVINE FRIEND was at Hand, of who&s;e Favour I was confident, I was content, I was chearful; and I felt a Peace within that pa&s;&s;ed all the under&s;tanding I &s;hould, other|wi&s;e, have had of Happine&s;s, though I had been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown-Revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="73">
Late on the fifth Night of my new Oc|cupation, as I was on my Return, and within a few Doors of my Lodging, I was &s;eized and a&s;&s;aulted by four Men, who were Porters, as I found by the Sequel. I &s;truggled the be&s;t I could, and got one of them under me; but the Re&s;t fell upon me, and cuffed, kicked, and brui&s;ed me, in a mi&s;erable manner. Oy, they cried, you are a Gentleman, and be damned, and yet, Thief as you are, you mu&s;t &s;teal into our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and glean away the few Pence, by which we get our daily Bread; but we'll cure you for carrying of Bur|thens, we warrant you!</P>
<P>They would undoubtedly have murder|ed me, had I not feigned my&s;elf already dead; but, ob&s;erving that I lay without any Signs of Life, they made off in Ha&s;te.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e as well as I was able, and, hold|ing by the Rails and Wall, got with Diffi|culty Home, where, crawling up Stairs, my Wife helped to undre&s;s me, and I went to Bed.</P>
<P>She then &s;ent for our old Phy&s;ician, who ordered me &s;ome Potions, with out|ward Fomentations to a&s;&s;uage the Contu&s;i|ons. I was however &s;eized, that Night, with a violent Fever, which continued up|ward
<PB N="75" REF="74">of three Weeks, but without any Delirium; and, within another Week, I was able to &s;it up, though &s;till very weak and greatly ematiated.</P>
<P>Our la&s;t five Guineas, with the Fruits of my late Employment, were now nearly expended on Doctor, Drugs, and &s;o forth. Wherefore, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to abridge our dome&s;tic Charge as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; and, having &s;ent our Girl with a Token for my Porter's Habiliments, I gave them to her in Lieu of what remained of her Wages, and, with the Help of an additio|nal Shilling, di&s;charged her.</P>
<P>I was now able to bear the Light, and the Windows were Half opened; but, how was I &s;hocked, on ob&s;erving that my <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> and my little <HI>Tommy,</HI> were as pale and as much fallen away as my&s;elf. For, <HI>Arabella</HI> had Half &s;tarved her Infant, and almo&s;t wholly &s;tarved her&s;elf, in order to &s;ave &s;ufficient for my Su&s;tenance during my Illne&s;s; Yet, &s;he bore up with a &s;weet and &s;miling Semblance; and, in her alone, was realized all, that ever I have &s;een, of the boa&s;ted Patience of Stoici&s;m, or, of the Power of Chri&s;tianity in effecting a <HI>new Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Within a little Time, I was once more able to walk about the Room; when, on
<PB N="76" REF="75">the Day preceding that wherein our Quar|ter's Rent was to become due; Mrs. <HI>Jennett</HI> enter'd with a Face wherein was prefaced, whatever In&s;olence, Hardne&s;s of Heart, or Contempt of our wretched Situ|ation could dictate. Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, if &s;o be your Name be <HI>Clement,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e I am not to tell you that To-morrow is Quarter Day. And yet, if &s;ome People, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> can't afford to eat, I can't &s;ee how they can afford to pay Rent, Mr. <HI>Clement;</HI> and &s;o, you know, 'tis ev'ry bit as comfortable to &s;tarve in Jail, as in Lodgings. But this is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. I am, my&s;elf, but a poor Wo|man, and no better than richer Folks. Yet poor as I am, Compari&s;ons may be odious between &s;ome People and &s;ome People, and, then, I don't come for Cha|rity; I come for nothing but my own, and that, you know, is the lea&s;t that will &s;atisfy any Body. If you had any one el&s;e to befriend you, but my&s;elf, you might a' been put upon the Pari&s;h before this. But, as I was &s;aying, I can't be an only Friend and all Friends at once. And I mu&s;t tell you that I hate Objects; for, I have &s;o much Pity in my Nature, that it pains me to look at 'em; and, above all, I can't abide 'em in my own Hou&s;e. And &s;o, as I told you, Mr. <HI>Con&s;table</HI> will be here in the Morning; and he will &s;hew you to Lodgings that will fit you much

<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone; <HI>Hammy</HI> &s;ays <HI>Arabella,</HI> our kind Landlady puts me in Mind of the Wife of hone&s;t <HI>Socrates,</HI> whom he took for the Trial and Exerci&s;e of his Patience. Ah, how cringing was this Woman! how in&s;olent is Servility when it attains any Power! But what, I wonder, is become of our Friends the Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es?</HI> I would have &s;ent to in|quire after them; but I was petted at their Neglect of us, during our long Illne&s;s. I will &s;tep there this Minute, and borrow as much, at lea&s;t, as will &s;natch my <HI>Hammy</HI> from the Fangs of this Fury.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, weak as &s;he was, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with a chearful Air, and going, plea&s;antly repeated, your Servant, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> if &s;o be that your Name be <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> I wi&s;h you a mighty good Morning.</P>
<P>She was not long abroad, and, on her Return, I ob&s;erved a kind of heavenly Radiance that &s;eemed to beam through her Countenance, from whence I prophe|cied all Manner of happy Succe&s;s. But, continuing &s;ilent for &s;ome Time, and look|ing
<PB N="78" REF="77">eagerly at me, &s;he &s;uddenly threw her|&s;elf into my Bo&s;om, and bur&s;t into Tears.</P>
<P>Ah <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;he cried; I had Hopes I was very &s;tout; but frail Nature, in &s;pight of Grace, confe&s;&s;es me a Coward. I thought I could have &s;een you peri&s;h, with Pati|ence, with Delight, provided I &s;aw a hap|py Immortality before you. But, now that your Sufferings are at Hand, I find them in&s;upportable. I tremble al&s;o for your Faith, le&s;t it &s;hould not &s;upport you under the impending Trial. Yes, <HI>Hammy,</HI> all is over. All is fini&s;hed, my Love, and the Hand of our God is in it. Our dear Mi&s;s <HI>Hodgin&s;es,</HI> were not to blame; the Elde&s;t died &s;uddenly, &s;ince we &s;aw them; and the Younge&s;t is with a di&s;tant Relati|on in the Country&punc; We have Nothing, further to hope, neither to fear from this World. Our God has &s;hut us out by every Door; and will neither permit the Friend&s;hip, the Humanity, or Charity of others, neither our own Indu&s;try or Inge|nuity to yield us a Mor&s;el of Bread; to convince us that we are his; and that all Things are his; that when he openeth his Hand, there is Plenty on every Side, but, when he plea&s;eth to &s;hut, there is no Re|&s;ource. What &s;ay you then, my Hu&s;|band? Are you willing to run this la&s;t &s;hort Cour&s;e? The Prize is glorious, un|&s;peakable,
<PB N="79" REF="78">and lies within a very few Paces of your Gra&s;p. You mu&s;t run it, my Hu&s;band, and your Repugnance would but &s;erve to make it in&s;ufferable. But Pati|ence and Courage would give you Strength to endure; and, a little further Conformi|ty to the Will of our Di&s;po&s;er, would turn all the Bitterne&s;s into Delight. Our Time is done, our Ta&s;k is fini&s;h'd; we are al|ready brought to Nothing, that our all may be in God.</P>
<P>Yes, I an&s;wered, it is evident from a Chain of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Proofs. I &s;ee the Hand of God in all that concerns us; and I am plea&s;ed with any In&s;tances of his Notice and Attention, whatever his final Purpo&s;e may be. I will no longer &s;truggle with his Omnipotence; nor make my Ignorance a &s;ounding-Line for his unbottomed Wi&s;|dom. If, to &s;ee you and our little Inno|cent thus fami&s;hing by the Hour; if, in contemplating your Wants and imagining your Pains, I feel an Angui&s;h, above what Death can give. Why, let it be; rend Heart into a thou&s;and Pieces! A Period mu&s;t at length be put to our Sufferings; and all, beyond, &s;hall be Peace, or what God plea&s;es. But, do you <HI>Arabella,</HI> do you lead the Way, my Patrone&s;s, my Di|rector! I will endeavour to keep the Brightne&s;s of your Example in View; that, neither here, nor hereafter, I may lo&s;e
<PB N="80" REF="79">Sight of her, without whom, here or hereafter, I think I cannot be happy.</P>
<P>About Nine, the next Morning, our Landlady entered, followed by two Con|&s;tables and two Apprai&s;ers. Thus autho|rized, as &s;he imagined, the fir&s;t Thing &s;he did was to &s;earch our Pockets for Mo|ney, but, without Effect; as we had ex|pended our la&s;t Penny, the Day before, for Bread. She, however, found my Wife's Ca&s;e of Sci&s;&s;ars and other Imple|ments for her Bu&s;ine&s;s; and, gathering up our Boxes, Linen, Handkerchiefs, and a Variety of Articles, which we never had a Notion of converting into Money, &s;he laid them all before the Apprai&s;ers, who, on frequent Con&s;ultation, valued the &s;ame to four Pounds nine Shillings, my Wife's Gown included, being nine and thirty Shillings more than we owed. But this our hone&s;t Landlady, very prudently ob|&s;erved was &s;carce &s;ufficient for Co&s;ts, and other Damages, which &s;he had &s;uffered or might have &s;uffered, or might yet &s;uffer on our Accounts.</P>
<P>Thus, we were turned out, almo&s;t na|ked, to the Mercy of the Elements; O, how deeply degraded below the Birds of the Air, the Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t, or even the Worms of the Sod, who rightfully claim Su&s;tenance from the Earth whereof
<PB N="81" REF="80">they were bred; and have &s;ome Hole apart, whereto they may creep for Shelter.</P>
<P>The World indeed lay before us. It was wide and all &s;ufficient; and yet, no|thing to our Purpo&s;e. We had neither Act or Part, Conern or Intere&s;t therein. It was to us, as a Harbour to Tempe&s;t-beaten Mariners, who are &s;hut out and driven thence, on Su&s;picion of the Plague.</P>
<P>All hopele&s;s, weak, and faint, we took our Way, we knew not whither; without Home wherto we might travel, or Point whereto we might &s;teer. We could think of no one living, who would receive or acknowledge us; and we &s;eemed to have no Way, &s;ave that of ha&s;tening, as fa&s;t as we could, from the Pre&s;ence of Mankind.</P>
<P>Slow and tottering, as we went, my Wife and I carried our little <HI>Tommy,</HI> by Turns, and, in the &s;moother Places, he walked with the Help of our Hands. Thus, with much Toil and Fatigue, we got out of <HI>London,</HI> and repo&s;ed our&s;elves on a Bank that lay a little off the Cau&s;e|way. Here, we found our&s;elves greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with Thir&s;t, and, getting up a|gain, we made toward a &s;mall Hut that &s;tood be&s;ide the Road, where they had the Charity to treat us with a Draught of cold Water. With this we were wonderfully
<PB N="82" REF="81">refre&s;hed and recruited; and, putting on again, <HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;ays my <HI>Arabella,</HI> no Con|queror, on his triumphal Entry into <HI>Rome,</HI> ever exulted as I do in your Fortitude, this Day. And, what &s;ignifies it, now, that it comes to the Te&s;t? It is but to travel, my Love, till we can travel no further; and then, we drop, fit and ready, and ripe for Eternity. O, how &s;weet it is to peri&s;h with a Patience that is plea&s;ed; how fearful, how horrible, to die &s;truggling and kicking again&s;t the Almighty.</P>
<P>As we went gently along, &s;till mutually &s;upporting and exhorting Each-other; I applyed for Alms, from Time to Time, to a Number of Pa&s;&s;engers; but, my Voice and Addre&s;s were &s;o feebly impor|tunate, or their Attention was &s;o engaged on di&s;tant and different Matters, that my Oratory returned as empty as it &s;et out.</P>
<P>At length I met a poor Beggarman, with a Wife and &s;even Children following in a Train. I looked at him wi&s;tfully, and having civily &s;aluted him, I entreated &s;ome little Matter, from his Bag or his Can, to keep my Infant from peri&s;hing on the Highway. God's Mercy, Ma&s;ter! &s;ays the charitable Mendicant, I am very &s;orry to &s;ee any Body poorer than my&s;elf; but, the Truth is that I have travelled a
<PB N="83" REF="82">great Way, and have eat and drunk all, with a Pox, except this la&s;t two Pence Half-penny; here it is, Ma&s;ter, God's Ble&s;&s;ing go along with it, I grieve, and &s;hall grieve, that it is not two Pounds for your Sake.</P>
<P>In Expectation of the Refre&s;hment we &s;hould derive from this Supply, we kept on at a creeping Pace, till we came to a little Ale Hou&s;e, that &s;tands about Half a Mile from this Town. There we enter|ed, and called for a Penny worth of Bread and a Pint of Drink, with &s;ome Milk for the Child. While we &s;at to repo&s;e our|&s;elves, the poor Man of the Hou&s;e, hav|ing eyed me with a kind of earne&s;t Com|pa&s;&s;ion, you look, &s;aid he, to be in much Trouble; but, if your Trouble is of a kind that may be cured, there is one Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> at Hand, whom God has placed in this Country, as the Sun in Heaven, to give Comfort to all within his Reach.</P>
<P>My Heart revived within me, at the&s;e Tidings, and was further prophetic of &s;ome happy Revolution. Having fini&s;hed our Pint, and laid up the Remainder of our Bread in Store, we di&s;charged our Reckoning, and &s;et out on our la&s;t Stage.</P>
<P>The Pro&s;pect of &s;peedy Relief, and the Po&s;&s;ibility that it might not arrive too late,
<PB N="84" REF="83">gave us Spirits beyond our Powers, and we pu&s;hed on till we came nearly oppo&s;ite to this Hou&s;e, though we did not then know to whom it belonged. Here, &s;lack|ening our Pace, we found our&s;elves grow|ing extremely &s;ick; whether it was, that we were overpowered, by the late Nou|ri&s;hment we had taken, or by a Toil and Fatigue that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed our Abilities.</P>
<P><HI>Hammy,</HI> &s;aid my <HI>Arabella,</HI> God be prai&s;|ed! it is done, it is fini&s;hed. I die, my <HI>Hammy,</HI> but I would not die within the Gaze of public Pa&s;&s;engers. Help me into the Field, if you are able, my Love. I have no further U&s;e for Charity, now, &s;ave that of laying my Limbs, with De|cency, in the Ground.</P>
<P>She &s;poke, nor had I the Power to an|&s;wer. But, overcome as I was by Sick|ne&s;s and Angui&s;h, I exerted my&s;elf to help her through the Turn&s;tile; and &s;itting down on the Sod, I laid her Head in my Lap, where &s;he fainted away. And there we remained in the Situation, in which your Charity found us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Story of <HI>Clement,</HI> my Friend, is truely intere&s;ting, and in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages may be edifying al&s;o. I have on|ly to ob&s;erve that it is too long for an
<PB N="85" REF="84">Epi&s;ode, and that the Character of your Heroine Milliner is con&s;train'd and unna|tural; it is elevated above the Fortitude and Virtues of Man him&s;elf, but quite out of the Sight and Soaring of any of her weak and &s;illy Sex. Had &s;he been a Prin|ce&s;s, and Empre&s;s, &s;he could not have fi|gured, in your Hi&s;tory, with greater Dig|nity.</P>

<P>Your Drollery is more provoking than argumentative, I mu&s;t tell you, Sir. I was not &s;peaking of the Lowline&s;s, but of the Fortitude of your <HI>Arabella;</HI> indeed it exceeds every Thing that I have met in Romance. Such an Exaltation of female Character is of evil Influence among the Sex; each Woman will be apt to arrogate &s;ome of the Merit to her&s;elf; their Vanity will be inflated, and they will ri&s;e, on the Stilts of <HI>Arabella,</HI> to a pre&s;umptuous Level with their natural Lords and Ma&s;ters. Women, unque&s;tionably, have their be|coming Qualities; in the Bedchamber, Kitchen, and Nur&s;ery, they are u&s;eful to Man; but, beyond the&s;e, my Friend, they are quite out of the Element of Nature and Common-Sen&s;e.</P>

<P>I have &s;adly mi&s;taken this whole Affair, it &s;eems, I actually apprehended that Woman might be admitted as a Companion to Man, and was intended, occa&s;ionally, to &s;often his Temper and poli&s;h his Manners. They have, at Times, formed Governors, Legi&s;lators, and Heroes. The great <HI>Pericles</HI> derived all the Powers of his Oratory, and the Elegance of his Ta&s;te from the Example and In|&s;tructions of the lovely <HI>A&s;pa&s;ia;</HI> and the <HI>Grachi</HI> al&s;o caught the Spirit of their Elo|quence, and the Fire of their Patrioti&s;m, from their Mother <HI>Cornelia.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all Means, my dear Sir, I am quite impatient to be in&s;tructed in the
<PB N="87" REF="86">Policies and Con&s;titution of this your pet|ticoat Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aut.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whenever you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to turn over to the third Chapter of the fir&s;t Book of the Prophet <HI>E&s;dras,</HI> you will, there find it written to the following Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Darius Hy&s;ta&s;pes,</HI> Suc|ce&s;&s;or to the <HI>Grand Cyrus,</HI> (whom you may have read of in Romance) <HI>Darius</HI> made a great Fea&s;t to all his Princes and Nobles, chief Captains, and Governors of his hun|dred and twenty &s;even Provinces.</P>
<P>And, at the Fea&s;t, three young and princely Geniu&s;es aro&s;e, and offered to di&s;|pute for Pre-eminence before the great A&s;&s;embly. And the Que&s;tion turned on, what was STRONGEST? and the fir&s;t &s;aid WINE is &s;tronge&s;t, and the &s;econd &s;aid the KING is &s;tronge&s;t, and the third &s;aid WOMAN is &s;tronge&s;t. And then, the Advocate for the Bottle thus began.</P>
<P>O ye Princes! bear me Te&s;timony, that Wine gives and takes away according to its Mightine&s;s. It takes away the Strength and Capacities of Nature, and gives Powers, Virtues and Talents of its own Acquiring.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="87">
It trips up the Wre&s;tler, and lays a Gi|ant low; and bears the Feeble and the Fearful into the Mid&s;t of the Battle.</P>
<P>Wine is an Opener of Hearts and a Re|vealer of Secrets. It rai&s;es Hope into Cer|tainty, and gives Jollity and Enjoyment in exchange for Care.</P>
<P>It unfolds the Pur&s;e of the U&s;urer, and enriches the needy; and frees the Pri&s;oner from his Chain, and the Debtor from his Obligation.</P>
<P>It levels the Rich and the Poor, the High and the Low, the King and the Clown to one Temper and Condition. It can &s;et Companions, Friends, and Bro|thers at Variance; and cau&s;e Rivals, Com|petitors, and Enemies to embrace.</P>
<P>Wine enlarges the narrow Heart, and thaws the frozen Under&s;tanding; it in&s;tructs the Ignorant in Arts, and to the Silent and Illiterate gives Phra&s;e and Elocution.</P>
<P>It can elevate the Pea&s;ant from a Cot|tage to a Throne; for he who is drunk is as great as an Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="88">
O ye Princes! what in Nature can be &s;tronger than that, by which all the Pow|ers of Nature are inverted or &s;urpa&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>And having &s;o &s;poken, he held his Peace.</P>
<P>Then aro&s;e the Advocate for Kingly Dominion, and, waving his Hand, thus addre&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>O Princes! how &s;hort and &s;ickly is the Influence of Wine, it pa&s;&s;es away as a Va|pour at the Dawning; we recollect it with Di&s;gu&s;t, or remember nothing thereof. But all Power, that is &s;table or durable, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The King is but one Man among a hundred and twenty &s;even Nations of Men; yet he over&s;eeth, connects, and governs the Whole. His are the Ho|nours, Coun&s;els, and Strength of all his People.</P>
<P>The Sun, who from on high looketh down on the wide World, beholdeth not at once the Extent of our King's Do|minion. He mu&s;t travel for the Pro&s;pect through the blue Expan&s;e of Heaven, and leave the we&s;tern Nations involved in
<PB N="90" REF="89">Night, when his Beam begins to ri&s;e on their Fellow-Subjects in the Orient.</P>
<P>For the King they plow and they &s;ow, they reap and plant Vineyards. For him the Stars &s;hine and &s;hed Influences upon Earth, and the Sea&s;ons change to yield our Monarch Variety of Productions. For him the Fruits ripen, the Shrubs drop their Balm, and the Blo&s;&s;oms breathe their Odours; all Winds blow Incen&s;e to him, and the four Quarters of the World pay him Tribute Day by Day.</P>
<P>If he bids to build they build; and if he bids to lay wa&s;te the Nations are made de&s;olate. Bli&s;s and Bane, Life and Death, Ruin and Re&s;toration are in the Breath of his Lips.</P>
<P>If he cries, War! it is War; the Ban|ners of Blood are let loo&s;e to the Wind, and the Sound of the Clarion kindles all Men to Battle. His Ho&s;ts cloath them|&s;elves in Harne&s;s, and range in terrible Array; and his Hor&s;es begin to neigh and tear up the Ground, and his Chariots to roll as di&s;tant Thunders. They move and cover the Earth wide as the Eye can reach. The Fore&s;ts are laid flat, the Mountains &s;hake beneath them, and neither the Rocks nor Rivers impede the March of his Ar|mies. They trample into Du&s;t the Fruits
<PB N="91" REF="90">of the Field, and the Labours of the In|du&s;trious; Hou&s;es, Vineyards, and &s;tand|ing-Corn, the Villages, and Towns &s;moke and flame on every Side.</P>
<P>Yet none a&s;k the King, wherefore is Peace, or wherefore is War? For he &s;tands exalted on Ruin, and is glorified in De&s;truction; his Word is the Bolt of irre|&s;i&s;table Power, and his Will makes the Appointment and Sanctitude of Law.</P>
<P>And having &s;o &s;aid, he &s;at down amid the Applau&s;es of the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;low and ba&s;hful, aro&s;e the young Advocate for the FAIR, and bow|ing thrice around, let his Words go forth as the breathing of &s;oft Mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>Great, O Princes! great is the Strength of WINE, and much greater the Strength and Glory of MAJESTY. But yet there is a POWER, that tempers and moderates, to which Rulers them&s;elves pay delightful Obedience.</P>
<P>Man is as the rough and crude Element of Earth, unmollified by the Fluidity of Water and Light. Heaven therefore &s;ent WOMAN, gentle, bright and beauteous Woman, to &s;ooth, form and illumine the Rudene&s;s of his Ma&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91">
She comes upon Man, in the Meekne&s;s of Water, and in the Brightne&s;s of the Morning-Beam; &s;he imperceptibly infu&s;es Love and Delight into him, and bids his Affections go forth upon Kindred and Country.</P>
<P>The Planter who planted the Vine|yard, and the Vintner who pre&s;&s;ed the Grape were born of Woman; and by Woman alone, the Subject and the Sove|reign receive Exi&s;tence, with all that can make Exi&s;tence advantageous or de&s;irable.</P>
<P>She brings Man forth in his Weakne&s;s, and &s;he brings him up to his Strength; he is fo&s;tered in her Bo&s;om, he is nou|ri&s;hed with her Sub&s;tance, and he imbibes into his Being the Sweetne&s;s of Humanity with the Milk of his Mother.</P>
<P>Without Woman, where would be Fa|ther or where would be Child? where the Relations, Endearments and Connections of Kindred, the Charities that bind the wide World together into one inclu&s;ive Family, the great BROTHERHOOD OF MAN?</P>
<P>She comes not again&s;t you, in the Ho&s;|tility of Weapons, or Fearfulne&s;s of Power. She comes in the Comfort and mild Light of Beauty; &s;he looks aba&s;hed and takes
<PB N="93" REF="92">you Captive; &s;he trembles and you obey. Yet her's is the &s;ure&s;t of all Signories on Earth; for her Dominion is &s;weet, and our Subjection is voluntary, and a Free|dom from her Yoke is what no Man could bear.</P>
<P>There are no Forms of human Govern|ment that can exempt us from her Sway, no Sy&s;tem of Laws that can exclude her Authority. Do we not &s;tudy, toil, and &s;weat, and go forth in the Darkne&s;s, and put our Face to every Danger, to win and bring home Trea&s;ure and Ornaments to our Love? even the Robbers and &s;avage Spoilers of Mankind grow tame to the civilizing Prerogative of Beauty.</P>
<P>If Men &s;eek Peace, it is to live in kind|ly Society with Woman; and if they &s;eek War, it is to plea&s;e her with the Report and Renown of their Valour.</P>
<P>Even the Highe&s;t, the Mightie&s;t, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings is caught in the fa&s;cinating Net of his <HI>Apame.</HI> I &s;aw her &s;eated by his Side; &s;he took the Crown from his Head, and gave it new Lu&s;tre by the Beauty of her Brow and the Brightne&s;s of her Tre&s;&s;es. I &s;aw her chide him in her Playfulne&s;s, and &s;trike him in her Petulance; yet he pre&s;&s;ed the Hand of her plea&s;ing Pre&s;umption to his
<PB N="94" REF="93">Lips; he gazed fondly and fixedly on her; if &s;he laughed he laughed al&s;o, but if &s;he affected Di&s;plea&s;ure, he &s;poke and looked Submi&s;&s;ion; and was fain to plead and &s;ue for Reconcilement.</P>
<P>Here ended the blooming Orator. The Monarch ro&s;e from his Throne and gave loud Applau&s;e, and the Roofs re&s;ounded with the Shouts and Acclamations of the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Wherefore it was decreed, <HI>by the Laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians,</HI> that female Beauty ought to govern the World in Meekne&s;s, and that Men owed thereunto a voluntary Obedience.</P>

<P>MR. CLEMENT, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I am &s;ingularly obliged and in&s;truct|ed by your Story. The Incidents of your Life have been very extraordinary, and have been evidently accompanied by the Controul and Attention of a peculiar Pro|vidence. The &s;ame Providence is, un|doubtedly, with, and over all his Works; though we are not willing to admit him in, what we call, common Occurrences, and which, we think, we can account for, without his Interpo&s;ition. But, in the Pa&s;&s;ages of your Story, we &s;ee Omnipo|tence walking along with you, Step for Step; by &s;udden Succe&s;&s;es, by Calamities as &s;udden, compelling you to attend to Him; wrenching every other Prop and Support from your Dependence, &s;hutting every other Pro&s;pect and Re&s;ource from your Sight; and, never for&s;aking you, in Weal or in Woe, till he had fully convin|ced you of his Fellow&s;hip and Regard, and had reconciled you to the bittere&s;t of the Di&s;pen&s;ations of your Creator.</P>
<P>Your Story, my dear Friend, has been, generally, conver&s;ant in middle, or low Life; and I ob&s;erve that there is &s;carce a Circum&s;tance, in it, which might not

<P>God, I &s;ee, has made u&s;e of very &s;evere Methods, to call you, and as I may &s;ay, to compel you to come in. But, do you think, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> that any Methods, le&s;s &s;evere, would have been equally ef|fectual? You mu&s;t admit they would not. And, this demon&s;trates to me the Difficul|ty, and almo&s;t the Impo&s;&s;ibility, of divert|ing any Man from that Habit of thinking and acting, which he contracts from the People with whom he is daily conver&s;ant. In a World of Saints, a Sinner mu&s;t be a Devil; but, in a World of Sinners, the Man, who has Grace to deviate, mu&s;t be a Saint indeed.</P>
<P>Had I been in your Situation, on the Day in which you &s;ay my Charity relieved you; I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf very little beholden to that Per&s;on, who would have plucked me back from my opening Paradi&s;e, into a World of who&s;e Woes I had been &s;o ju&s;tly weary. No, no, my Friend, I did you and your <HI>Arabella</HI> the wor&s;t Office, as I think, that ye will ever receive. It was not to you that God in|tended
<PB N="97" REF="96">any Benefit, by re&s;toring you to Life; it was to tho&s;e, and I hope they are many in Number; who are to have the Advantage of your Example and In&s;tructi|ons. It is an Advantage of which I, al&s;o, propo&s;e to avail my&s;elf; and I reque&s;t you, in Behalf of my little <HI>Harry</HI> in particular, to accept your fir&s;t Retainer from our Hands.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> carele&s;sly &s;lid a Pur&s;e of a hundred Guineas into <HI>Clements</HI>'s Coat Pocket, and, ha&s;tily calling to know if Supper was ready, left the Room with|out Ceremony.</P>
<P>In about an Hour the Cloth was laid, and Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ordered his Family to be called together. He had &s;eldom &s;een <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> and never had noticed her, for fear of adding to that Confu&s;ion with which he &s;aw her oppre&s;&s;ed at their fir&s;t Meeting. But now his Sen&s;es were all open and alive for Ob&s;ervation, and, on her Entrance, he &s;aluted her, as he would have received and &s;aluted a de&s;cending Seraph.</P>
<P>She had not yet recovered her Fle&s;h or her Complexion; and Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> for &s;ome Time looked at her, in vain, to di&s;cover tho&s;e &s;triking and irre&s;i&s;table Beauties, to which Lu&s;t had fallen a Victim, by which Friend&s;hip had been &s;educed, and to
<PB N="98" REF="97">which a whole People had borne joint Te&s;|timony, by a Voucher of public Pro&s;trati|on and Applau&s;e. But, of all that Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had previou&s;ly thought nece&s;&s;ary for producing &s;uch extraordinary and a&s;to|ni&s;hing Effects; he &s;aw nothing but a Sentiment of Lowline&s;s, throughout; a &s;omething, in Face, in Voice, and in Mo|tion, that was lovely, for no other Rea&s;on, that He could find, but for its being quite impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not be beloved.</P>
<P>When they had &s;at down to Table, and eat, and chatted awhile on indifferent Matters; Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ure Mrs. <HI>Cle|ment</HI> is a greater Scholar than Mr. <HI>Vindex;</HI> and &s;he taught me a latin Le&s;&s;on to Day; and I would rather learn five Le&s;&s;ons from her than one from him; for &s;he can't look &s;o cro&s;s at me as Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> do you think &s;he can, Dada? No, <HI>Harry,</HI> I think not, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> if &s;he can find in her Heart to be cro&s;s, &s;he can't find it in her Face, and &s;o we &s;hall know nothing of the Matter. Well, well, Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> for all that, I'm &s;ure &s;he can't find in her Heart to whip Half &s;o hard, and &s;o I don't repent of my Bargain. What Bargain, <HI>Harry?</HI> Why, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> you mu&s;t know that &s;he is to be my Tutor, and I am to pay her at the rate of twenty Ki&s;&s;es a Day. But, indeed, it is not an hone&s;t Bargain, as you &s;hall hear, poor Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> has
<PB N="99" REF="98">cheated her&s;elf mo&s;t &s;adly; for every Ki&s;s I give her, I take Two away; and they are the &s;weete&s;t Ki&s;&s;es you ever got in your Life.</P>
<P>Here poor <HI>Arabella</HI> was put, &s;adly, to the Blu&s;h, though &s;he could not help join|ing in the Laugh of the Company.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> you talk, as feelingly of Ki&s;&s;es, as if you had been the Son and Heir of one <HI>Secundus,</HI> who wrote a very ingenious Treati&s;e on the Subject. But, pray Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> do you under|&s;tand the Languages? Ah, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Ara|bella,</HI> again blu&s;hing, I fear that my young Lover has brought me into a &s;ad Scrape. I know nothing indeed, Sir, that does not &s;erve to put me in mind of my own Igno|rance. Ah, what a Boa&s;t is there, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and all &s;ub&s;equent Philo&s;ophers fall infinitely &s;hort of &s;uch an Extent of Knowledge. But, tell me, <HI>Hammel,</HI> continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> does your <HI>Arabella</HI> under&s;tand the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Languages? Not that ever I knew of, I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Cle|ment;</HI> and, yet, I thought I had di&s;cover|ed the Limits of her Talents; tho' I de|&s;paired of ever reaching the Extent of her Virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99">
<HI>Hammy, Hammy,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> would you bani&s;h me from a Table, where Con|ver&s;ation makes the Fea&s;t, and Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> is a Speaker? But, Sir, &s;ince my De&s;ire of in&s;tructing this your little <HI>Harry,</HI> the deare&s;t and lovelie&s;t of all human Crea|tures, has brought me to the Shame of betraying a fooli&s;h Smattering in &s;uch Mat|ters, I will tell you how it happened.</P>
<P>My dear good Father was a Clergyman, and, as his Living was very &s;mall, he de|rived his principal Income from Boarding, and In&s;tructing the Children of the neigh|bouring Gentlemen. As I was his only Child, he loved me to a faulty Exce&s;s, and hardly ever &s;uffered me to be out of his Sight. I u&s;ed therefore to Work at my Sampler, in his School-Room; and, the frequent Repetitions, which the Boys made of their Le&s;&s;ons, in&s;en&s;ibly and in|voluntarily forced them&s;elves upon my Memory. I was, by Degrees, infected with the De&s;ire of knowing &s;omething of what engaged the whole Attention of all about me. The Floor and the Windows were, often, &s;pread with Books, which I took up and peru&s;ed in private at my Plea&s;ure. And, at length, I was applied to, by mo&s;t of the Scholars, as well for my A&s;&s;i&s;tance in framing their Exerci&s;es,
<PB N="101" REF="100">as for my powerful Mediation in &s;aving them from the La&s;h.</P>
<P>My Error, in thus wandering from the Sphere of my Sex, will appear, as I hope, the more excu&s;able; when I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that, from the Moment I entered the World with my dear decea&s;ed Aunt, I ne|ver looked into one of tho&s;e my favourite Authors; though I &s;till retain many of the Pa&s;&s;ages in them. But, above all, I &s;hall never forget the Indi&s;cretion of <HI>Homer,</HI> in his Character of <HI>Hector,</HI> the great Enemy of <HI>Greece.</HI> The Poet appears to make a mighty Parade of the Power, the Valour, and Virtue of his Countrymen. He fur|ther gives them the whole Merit and Ju&s;|tice of the Cau&s;e; and he calls upon Gods and Men, in their Favour, for the Righting and Reformation of Iniquity and Offence. But, does he give you the &s;en&s;ible and odious In&s;tances of this Iniquity on the Part of the Adver&s;ary? By no Means, as I take it. He &s;ums up all <HI>Troy,</HI> and even all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in the Character and Prowe&s;s of a &s;ingle Man. On the Part of the <HI>Tro|jans,</HI> on the Side of the Delinquents, you &s;ee nothing but <HI>Hector,</HI> you hear of no|thing but <HI>Hector.</HI> And again, what do you hear of him, or what do you &s;ee of him? Even all that is admirable; all that is amiable; whatever can be, &s;everally, culled and collected, from the Worth and
<PB N="102" REF="101">the Sweetne&s;&s;es of human-Nature; in his Submi&s;&s;ions to his King, in his Attach|ments to his Country, in his filial Affecti|ons, in his conjugal Delicacies, in his pa|ternal Fears and Feelings, in his Ardour for his Friends, in his Humanity to his Enemies, and, even in his Piety to the Gods that he wor&s;hipped (no Deduction from his Courage according to ancient Arithmetic) I &s;hould be glad, I &s;ay, to know in what Hi&s;tory, true or feigned, I might find his Fellow.</P>
<P>How injudiciou&s;ly, then, did this Au|thor connect an iniquitous Cau&s;e with &s;o righteous a Per&s;on; to whom no one liv|ing could take Exception; and, with whom no one living could cordially be at Vari|ance. In favour therefore of <HI>Hector,</HI> you wi&s;h well to the Abettors of the Ravi&s;hers of <HI>Helen.</HI> And, in Favour of <HI>Hector,</HI> you are, almo&s;t, tempted to wi&s;h ill to tho&s;e generous Patriots, who, at the Ri&s;que of their Honours, their Fortunes, and their Lives, came to vindicate the undoubted Rights of their Country; and con&s;equently the Rights of all Mankind. &mdash; But &mdash; but &mdash; Is there no one &s;o friendly, here, as to in|terrupt me, before all my Folly is let out?</P>
<P>You have no &s;uch Friend here, I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102">
Well, well, Gentlemen, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> blu&s;hing deeper than before, I leave ye to laugh away; and I would &s;tay, and laugh with ye with all my Heart, at any Ex|pence but that of female Learning, ye know. And &s;o &s;aying, up &s;he &s;tarted, and away &s;he would have flown; but Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> got between her and the Door.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid he, would you &s;erve us &s;o? Do but think, what Sort of a World this would be with|out a Woman; and then think what a Figure this Hum-drum <HI>Hammy,</HI> of yours, and I &s;hould make without you. So &s;ay|ing, he took her Hand and replaced her in her Chair. But why, continued he, why all this Blu&s;hing, my dear Mrs. <HI>Cle|ment?</HI> indeed my Child it is a Compliment that we cannot de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir, cried Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> it is a Compliment which I would very gladly &s;pare, if I could help it. But, I mu&s;t be a very guilty Body to be &s;ure; and my Faults I find mu&s;t be very much my Ene|mies, when they are ready to fly in my Face, every Moment.</P>
<P>Why, Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> do you hold Blu&s;hing to be any Evidence of Guilt? Certainly, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> it
<PB N="104" REF="103">can be nothing but a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;omewhat ami&s;s, that ought to give Shame to any &s;en&s;ible Per&s;on. Mr. Serjeant <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> pray, what is your Judgment on the Ca&s;e in Hand?</P>
<P>In truth, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Clement,</HI> it is a Ca&s;e to which I am not prepared to plead. I have, indeed, heard many and various Opinions on the Subject, though generally coinciding with that of my <HI>Arabella.</HI> And, more particularly, in Conver&s;ations of ri|bald Entendre, I have heard it affirmed, that the Blu&s;hing of a Woman is a &s;ure Proof of her under&s;tanding much more than became her.</P>
<P>Hold there, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> the mere under&s;tanding of Good or Evil, can no more be a Fault in the Creature than in the Creator, the E&s;&s;ence of Guilt bears no Reference to Knowledge, but con&s;i&s;ts in the Approbation of Evil alone. A Woman therefore, who blu&s;hes at what &s;he di&s;ap|proves, blu&s;hes not for her&s;elf, but for the Faults of her rude and ill-mannered Com|pany, who have not the Grace to blu&s;h for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak here of Blu&s;hing; I would not be under&s;tood, by any Means, to in|clude the Flu&s;hings of De&s;ire, or the Red|denings of Anger, or any &s;uch like turbu|lent
<PB N="105" REF="104">and irregular Emotions. I mean no other than that ready Expre&s;&s;ion of Shame, which, as our <HI>Arabella</HI> &s;weetly hinted ju&s;t now, ari&s;es from an Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome|thing being ami&s;s in our&s;elves, or others. But who or what is it that apprehends, in this Ca&s;e? Is it Guilt that is afraid or a&s;hamed of Guilt? No &s;urely. It is Vir|tue, alone, that can fear or be a&s;hamed of the Neighbourhood of its Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>I will take an In&s;tance from a Per&s;on, who is actually guilty of &s;omething very enormous, and who blu&s;hes, on his being que&s;tioned or &s;u&s;pected of the Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion. His blu&s;hing here demon&s;trates his Sen&s;ibility; and his Sen&s;ibility demon&s;trates &s;ome Principle within him, that di&s;approved and reproached him for what he had com|mitted. And &s;o long as this Spark or Principle remains unquenched in the Bo|&s;om; &s;o long as the wicked them&s;elves can feel Compunction and be a&s;hamed of wick|edne&s;s; &s;o long their Recovery is not to be de&s;paired of.</P>
<P>It is therefore from the Fountain of Vir|tue, alone, that this Flu&s;h of Shamefaced|ne&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly flow. And a Delicacy of Compunction, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, is as a &s;en&s;itive Plant of Divinity in the Soul, that feels, &s;hrinks, and is alarmed on the &s;light|e&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of approaching Evil.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="105">
Well, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> allowing all that you have advanced in Behalf of Blu&s;h|ers, (and that is doing them more Favour than I fear they de&s;erve) can it amount to more than this, that, however faulty they may be, they &s;till have Goodne&s;s enough to acknowledge their Guilt, or in other Words, that they have the Ju&s;tice to be a&s;hamed of them&s;elves?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> it a|mounts to much more, and you know that it does. But you are a wicked little Sophi&s;ter, and de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed, by our yielding to you the Cau&s;e that you have undertaken again&s;t your&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I ob&s;erved that nothing, but Vir|tue, could unde&s;ignedly expre&s;s a Di&s;ap|probation of Vice; I ought further to have ob&s;erved that, the greater and the purer, the more excellent and more vivid that this Virtue is, the more apt it will be to take Alarm, at the bare Apprehen&s;ion of hav|ing &s;aid or done, or of being &s;u&s;pected to have &s;aid, or done, or thought of any thing ami&s;s, or contrary to its own Na|ture.</P>
<P>As far as a guilty Per&s;on loves and is reconciled to Guilt, it becomes a Part of him&s;elf, and he cannot blu&s;h at it. But
<PB N="107" REF="106">Goodne&s;s will blu&s;h in a Clo&s;et, in a De|&s;art, in Darkne&s;s, on fearing it was in Danger to have &s;aid or done any Thing unbecoming or di&s;gu&s;tful to its own Sen|&s;ibilities. For a delicate Virtue is, like a delicate Cha&s;tity, that will blu&s;h to have been &s;een, or, even &s;u&s;pected to have been &s;een within the Suburbs of Drury.</P>
<P>But again, where &s;uch a delicate Virtue is accompanied by Lowline&s;s, there needs not any Thing ami&s;s, nor the &s;lighte&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of any Thing ami&s;s, to ex|cite this &s;weet Confu&s;ion in the Soul and in the Countenance. Humility will blu&s;h to be found in the Pre&s;ence of tho&s;e whom it reveres; it will blu&s;h to be thought of, either too meanly or too highly, by tho&s;e who&s;e favourable Opinion it wi&s;hes to merit; and I once knew a Lady blu&s;h, for being detected of Accompli&s;hments that would have been Matter of Pride and Boa&s;ting to any other Woman.</P>
<P>This graceful Effu&s;ion of a virtuous and humble Heart is, as I once hinted, the highe&s;t and, generally, the mo&s;t grateful Compliment that a Per&s;on can pay to the Company; as it is an Expre&s;&s;ion of De|ference, and a comparative Acknowledg|ment of &s;uperior Merit. But, it is more peculiarly amiable in your Sex, Mrs. <HI>Cle|ment;</HI> it is that <HI>Shamefacedne&s;s,</HI> &s;o grateful
<PB N="108" REF="107">to God and Man, and which, in Scripture, is called the mo&s;t becoming Cloathing, and be&s;t Ornament of a Woman.</P>
<P>However, my dear Child, as this Emo|tion is generally attended with &s;ome little Matter of Pain; the pre&s;ent Company are too much your Friends, to receive any kind of Plea&s;ure from a Compliment as unmerited, as it is wholly unnece&s;&s;ary. And, in Truth, there is but one Thing, that I can think of, for which Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> ought to blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, don't hold me in Pain, what is it, I be&s;eech you? It is for being a Re|proach almo&s;t to her whole Sex.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir, cried <HI>Arabella,</HI> ri&s;ing, &s;miling, and blu&s;hing, and curt&s;ying down to the Ground; excu&s;e me if I don't &s;tay to hear my&s;elf &s;o abu&s;ed; and, turning, away &s;he &s;wam and di&s;appeared in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, <HI>Clement</HI> took out his Pur&s;e of a hundred Guineas, and, pray Sir, &s;aid he, what &s;hall I do with all this Money? O, as for that Matter, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I know People, not half &s;o ingenious as you are, who could quickly contrive to get rid of a much larger Sum. Lay it out in decent Cloathing for your&s;elf
<PB N="109" REF="108">and your <HI>Arabella,</HI> and I will find &s;ome way to have you reimbur&s;ed. In &s;hort, <HI>Hammel,</HI> I can't think of parting with you, if my Fortune may &s;erve for a &s;ufficient Cement. I will pay you two hundred Guineas yearly, while you &s;tay with me; and I will &s;ettle on you, one thou&s;and Pounds, in ca&s;e of my Mortality, to put you into &s;ome little Station of Indepen|dence.</P>
<P>Sir, Sir, cried <HI>Clement,</HI> he&s;itatingly, you oppre&s;s me, you &mdash; Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> putting his Hand to his Mouth, no Compliments, my dear Friend. It is not your Thanks but your Services that I want; and you may readily make them more than an Equivalent to &s;uch Matters. I value the In&s;tilling of a &s;ingle Principle of Goodne&s;s or Honour, into the Mind of my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> beyond all the Wealth that the Indies can remit. Ah, <HI>Hammel,</HI> why wa&s;n't that Brat of yours a Girl, in|&s;tead of a Boy? She might one Day have been the Wife of my precious <HI>Harry;</HI> and I &s;hould then have had &s;ome of the Breed of this wonderful <HI>Arabella.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Hammy,</HI> continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I would not have you, through any Zeal, or Attachment to me, think of pu&s;hing my Boy into Learning or the Languages, beyond his own Plea&s;ure. Neither would
<PB N="110" REF="109">I have you oppre&s;s or perplex his infant Mind, with the deep or my&s;terious Parts of our holy Religion. Fir&s;t, be it your Care to in&s;truct him in Morality; and let the Law precede the Go&s;pel, for &s;uch was the Education which God appointed for the World. Give him, by familiar and hi&s;|torical In&s;tances, an early Impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;hortne&s;s of human Life, and of the Nature of the World in which he is placed. Let him learn, from this Day forward, to di&s;tingui&s;h between natural and imaginary Wants; and, that nothing is e&s;timable or ought to be de&s;irable, but &s;o far as it is nece&s;&s;ary, or u&s;eful to Man. In&s;truct my Darling, daily and hourly, if po&s;&s;ible, in a Preference of Manners and Things that bear an intrin&s;ic Value, to tho&s;e that re|ceive their Value and Currency from the arbitrary and fickle Stamp of Fa&s;hion. Shew him al&s;o, my <HI>Hammel,</HI> that the &s;ame Toils and Sufferings; the &s;ame Poverty and Pain, from which People now fly as they would from a Plague, were once the De&s;ire of Heroes and the Fa&s;hion of Na|tions. And, that Thou&s;ands of Patriots, of Captains, and Philo&s;ophers, through a Love of their Country, or of Glory, of Applau&s;e during Life or Di&s;tinction after Death, have rejected Wealth and Plea&s;ure, embraced Want and Hard&s;hip; and &s;uffer|ed more, from a voluntary Mortification and Self-denial, than our Church &s;eems to
<PB N="111" REF="110">require in the&s;e Days, for the Conque&s;t of a &s;en&s;ual World into which we are fallen, and for entitling us to a Crown in the Kingdom of Eternity.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> got up from Ta|ble, and ob&s;erving that it was late, wi&s;hed <HI>Clement</HI> a good Night.</P>
<P>Our Hero was now eight Years of Age; and weekly, and daily, continued to be exerci&s;ed, in Feats of bodily Prowe&s;s and Agility; and in Acts of mental Benevo|lence, and Service to Mankind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had, already, provided his Favourite with a Dancing-Ma&s;ter, the mo&s;t approved for Skill in his Profe&s;&s;ion; as al&s;o, with a noted Fencing-Ma&s;ter, who further taught him the noble Sciences of the Cudgel and Quarter-Staff. He was now on the Search for the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Champion of the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> in order to accompli&s;h our Hero in the My&s;|teries of Brui&s;ing, of Wre&s;tling, and of Tripping; and having, in a &s;hort Time, procured the Per&s;on de&s;ired; he purcha&s;ed for his <HI>Harry</HI> a &s;mall but beautiful Spani&s;h Jennett that was perfectly dre&s;&s;ed, as they call it, or rid to the Manage; and, once in every Week or Fortnight, he accom|panied his Darling to the Riding-Hou&s;e in <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> where he &s;aw him in&s;tructed in
<PB N="112" REF="111">all the Arts and Elegancies of Hor&s;eman|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Harry</HI> had his little Hands as full of Bu&s;ine&s;s as they could hold. But he was, naturally, of an active and vivid Di&s;|po&s;ition; and Time, unemployed, lay up|on him as the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t irk&s;ome of all Burdens. He, therefore, proceeded from his Book to his Exerci&s;es, and from one Exerci&s;e to another, as an Epicure does among a number of Di&s;hes; where the Variety of the Sea&s;oning excites in him a new Appetite to Each.</P>
<P>Within a few Weeks after the late Di&s;|&s;ertation upon Blu&s;hing, the &s;ame Com|pany being pre&s;ent and Dinner removed; <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> tell me which of the Two is the Riche&s;t, the Man who wants lea&s;t, or the Man who has mo&s;t? Let me think, Dada, &s;ays <HI>Harry</HI> &mdash; Why, &s;ure, they are the &s;ame Thing; aren't they, Dada? By no Means, my Darling, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI></P>
<P>There lived two famous Men, at the &s;ame Time, the one was called <HI>Diogenes,</HI> and the other <HI>Alexander. Diogenes</HI> refu&s;ed to accept of any worldly Goods, &s;ave one wooden Cup to carry Water to his Mouth; but, when he found that he could drink, by lying down and putting his Mouth to
<PB N="113" REF="112">the Stream, he threw his Cup away as a Thing that he did not want.</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> on the other Side, was a great Conqueror. And, when he had conquered and got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the World, he fell a crying becau&s;e there was not a hundred more &s;uch Worlds for him to conquer. Now, which of the&s;e two was the riche&s;t, do you think?</P>
<P>O Dada, exclaimed <HI>Harry, Diogenes</HI> to be &s;ure, <HI>Diogenes</HI> to be &s;ure. He who wants nothing is the riche&s;t Man in the World. <HI>Diogenes,</HI> Dada, was richer than <HI>Alexander</HI> by a hundred Worlds.</P>
<P>Very true, my Love, rejoin'd Mr. <HI>Fen|ton. Alexander</HI> had a whole World more than <HI>Diogenes</HI> wanted, and yet de&s;ired a hundred Worlds more than he had. Now, as no Man will allow that he wants what he does not de&s;ire, and all affirm that they want what&s;oever they do de&s;ire, De&s;ires and Wants are generally accounted as one and the &s;ame Thing. And yet, my <HI>Harry,</HI> there is a Thing, of which it may be &s;aid, that the more we de&s;ire it the le&s;s we want it, and that the le&s;s we de&s;ire of it the greater is our Want.</P>
<P>What in the World can that be, Dada? &mdash; It is <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> my Love. Well, &s;ays
<PB N="114" REF="113"><HI>Harry,</HI> I will not puzzle my Brains about nice Matters. All I know is, that no Man has more Goodne&s;s than he wants, except it be your&s;elf. I don't talk of Women, for I believe Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> here, is very good; pray look in her Face, Dada, don't you think &s;he is very good?</P>
<P>I &s;ee, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that young as you are, you are a perfect Phy&s;iogno|mi&s;t. Why, pray Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> is it, in earne&s;t, your Opinion, that the Cha|racter of Mind or Manners, may, in any Mea&s;ure, be gathered from the Form of the Countenance? Is not the World filled with Stories of the Deceit and Treachery of &s;uch fal&s;e Appearances? You remember how <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays that a prudent Mariner puts no Tru&s;t in the Gildings or Paintings of a Ship; &s;uch &s;uperficial Glo&s;&s;ings, as one might think, ought, rather, to be &s;u&s;pect|ed of an Intention to conceal the Rottenne&s;s of the Timber. And then, the Pa&s;&s;age of the famous Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts, at <HI>Athens,</HI> &s;o often quoted as a Proof of Capacity and Knowledge in this Way, proves wholly the Rever&s;e, as I take it; their Judgment of <HI>Socrates</HI> is oppo&s;ite to Truth in every In|&s;tance; they pronounce him the mo&s;t de|bauched, ira&s;cible, and malicious of Men; and it is a very poor Apology that <HI>Socrates</HI> makes for their Ignorance, when he affirms that he was, by Birth, the very Per&s;on they
<PB N="115" REF="114">deemed him, but that Philo&s;ophy had given him a new Nature; for if Education can change the Heart, without changing the Countenance, how can we form any Con|jecture of the one by the other?</P>
<P>Though I in&s;i&s;t, Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> that you are wrong in your The&s;is, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I admit that you are perfectly ju&s;t in your Inference. For, if a Change of Mind or Manners can make no Change in the A&s;pect, the whole Science of Phy&s;iog|nomy mu&s;t fall to the Ground. I there|fore take this Pa&s;&s;age, relating to <HI>Socrates,</HI> to be a mere Fiction; and I affirm that neither Philo&s;ophy, nor Chri&s;tianity, can make a new Heart or a new Nature in Man, without making a &s;uitable Alteration in his Vi&s;age.</P>
<P>As the Heavens are made expre&s;&s;ive of the Glory of God, though frequently over|ca&s;t with Clouds and Tempe&s;t, and &s;ome|times breaking forth in Thunders that terrify, and Lightenings that bla&s;t; &s;o, the general Tenour of a human Countenance is made expre&s;&s;ive of the Nature of the Soul that lives within; and, to which it is ordained an involuntary Interpreter.</P>
<P>Many Per&s;ons have made it the Study of great Part of their Lives, to counteract Providence in this hone&s;t Appointment;
<PB N="116" REF="115">to &s;hut this Window, by which, an im|pertinent World is &s;o apt to peep in, and &s;py what they are about; and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to make the Expre&s;&s;ions of their Countenance, to belie every Sentiment and Emotion of their Heart.</P>
<P>I have known <HI>Hypocri&s;y, Treachery, Pride, Malice,</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;t,</HI> a&s;&s;ume the oppo&s;ite Sem|blance of <HI>Saint&s;hip, Fidelity, Lowline&s;s, Be|nevolence,</HI> and <HI>Cha&s;tity:</HI> But, it is painful to keep the Bow of Nature long bent; its Ela&s;ticity will &s;till &s;truggle to have it re|&s;tored; and a &s;killful Di&s;cerner, at the Time of &s;uch Delu&s;ion, will often detect the Difference between a real Character and the acting of a Part. For, when Na|ture dictates, the whole Man &s;peaks; all is uniform and con&s;enting in Voice, Mien, Motion, the turn of each Feature, and the Ca&s;t of the Eyes. But, when Art is the Spoke&s;man, and that Nature is not alto|gether &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; the Turn of the Eye may contradict the Tongue; and the Mu&s;cles of the Face may counteract each other in their &s;everal Workings. And, thus, I have known an Expre&s;&s;ion of Re|&s;entment remain on the Brow, while the Face laboured to inve&s;t it&s;elf with a Smile of Complacence; and, I have known the Eye to burn with ill-governed Concupi|&s;cence, while Voice, Action, and Addre&s;s,
<PB N="117" REF="116">united in the Avowal of cha&s;te and ho|nourable Regards.</P>
<P>I perceive, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> by your own Account, that he mu&s;t be a ve|ry learned Proficient, in the Study of Phy|&s;iognomy, who can decide, with any kind of Certainty, on an Art that requires &s;uch Attention and Penetration.</P>
<P>I beg leave to differ, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fen|ton.</HI> The Science is much more obvious than you may imagine; and I fancy there are very few Per&s;ons, who do not tru&s;t, without reflecting, to their own Skill in this Way; and who do not, inadvertently, form a Character to them&s;elves of almo&s;t all the People with whom they are con|ver&s;ant.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that there is not a &s;ingle Sentiment, whether tending to Good or Evil, in the human Soul, that has not its di&s;tinct and re&s;pective Interpreter in the Glance of the Eye, and in the Mu&s;cling of the Countenance. When Nature is permitted to expre&s;s Her&s;elf with Free|dom by this Language of the Face, &s;he is under&s;tood by all People; and tho&s;e who never were taught a Letter can in|&s;tantly read her Signatures and Impre&s;&s;i|ons; whether they be of Wrath, Hatred, Envy, Pride, Jealou&s;y, Vexation, Con|tempt;
<PB N="118" REF="117">Pain, Fear, Horror and Di&s;may; or of Attention, Re&s;pect, Wonder, Sur|prize, Plea&s;ure, Tran&s;port, Complacence, Affection, De&s;ire, Peace, Lowline&s;s, and Love.</P>
<P>Now, all Per&s;ons are born with Propen|&s;ities (whether they be mental or con&s;titu|tional) to &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, ra|ther than to Others. I will take two In|&s;tances; the one, of a Male Infant who is born with a Propen&s;ity to Pride and Arro|gance: The other of a Female Infant, who is born with a Propen&s;ity to Ba&s;hful|ne&s;s and Lowline&s;s. In either Ca&s;e, it is evident, that, from the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion that may &s;erve to excite the&s;e &s;everal Affecti|ons, in the&s;e &s;everal Infants, the Senti|ments of their Souls will be &s;uitably and intelligibly expre&s;&s;ed in their A&s;pects; and every further Occa&s;ion of renewing the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ions will render them more obvious and legible to every Eye. In&s;o|much that, if no future Influence, ari&s;ing from Accident or Education, &s;hall check the Pride of the one or divert the Lowli|ne&s;s of the other; the Male will be &s;een to look on tho&s;e about him with an habi|tual Self-&s;ufficiency and Contempt of his Species; and the Female will be &s;een to regard Humankind, with an amiable Dif|fidence and a complacent Re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="118">
Let us &s;ee however, how far Education may be able to change the&s;e Sentiments; and, how far a Change of Sentiments may produce a Change of Face.</P>
<P>If the Scorner &s;hould be &s;o happy as to meet with worthy Tutors, wi&s;e, and dili|gent to inculcate the In&s;ufficiency of all Creatures, and more particularly the Wants, Weakne&s;&s;es, and Vilene&s;s, of our lap&s;ed Natures; and that no Honour can belong to Man in this his State of Depravity. But above all, &s;hould this Scorner prove &s;o happy as to be educated in the never failing School of Chri&s;tian Meekne&s;s; even the School of Adver&s;ity, of Pain, Sickne&s;s, depre&s;&s;ing Poverty, and Mortification; his lofty Cre&s;t by Degrees will be effectually unplumed; his Sufficiency and high Mind|edne&s;s will &s;ink to an humble Prayer and look out for Relief; and he will re&s;pect even the Wretched, becau&s;e he will ac|quire a &s;ocial Sen&s;e and Fellow-feeling of their Wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here, then, is another Man, as new made and as different from his former Self as he can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed from any other of the human Species. But, will this total Change of Sentiment produce no Change of A&s;pect, think you? Will this benevo|lent and lowly Man retain the &s;ame Front
<PB N="120" REF="119">of Haughtine&s;s, the &s;ame Brow of Over|bearance, the &s;ame Eye of Elevation, the &s;ame Lip of Ridicule, and the &s;ame Glance of Contempt? It cannot be &s;aid, it cannot be imagined.</P>
<P>When God, by his in&s;pired Penmen, expre&s;&s;es his Dete&s;tation of <HI>a lofty Look,</HI> was he quarrelling, do ye think, with the natural and unavoidable Ca&s;t of an unhap|py Countenance? No, no, my dear Friends. In condemning a proud A&s;pect, he con|demned a proud Heart; fora&s;much as he knew that a Loftine&s;s of Look and a Saucine&s;s of Soul could not be divided.</P>
<P>But, to clear up this Que&s;tion from any remaining Doubt, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the female Infant, with ba&s;hful and lowly Propen&s;ities, is ju&s;t brought down, blu&s;h|ing and trembling, from the Nur&s;ery. Let us &s;uppo&s;e her Education to be taken in Hand, by a Mama of Figure and Fa&s;hi|on, and by other Dames of Quality, who&s;e E&s;timate of Happine&s;s is mea&s;ured merely by the Mode. She now becomes in&s;tructed in more In&s;tances of Self-Denial, than &s;uch as dictated and tuned by Chri&s;|tianity, would have &s;ainted her for Eterni|ty. She is taught to &s;uppre&s;s her natural Feelings and Inclinations, and to bridle the Impul&s;es of an affectionate and humble Heart. She is taught to prize what &s;he
<PB N="121" REF="120">di&s;likes, and to prai&s;e what &s;he di&s;ap|proves; to affect Coldne&s;s and Di&s;tance to Inferiors whom &s;he regarded, and to pro|portion her Appearance of Inclination, and Re&s;pect, to the Station of the Party.</P>
<P>As I have been Ear-witne&s;s to &s;everal of the&s;e Quality Lectures, I might give you many familiar In&s;tances of their Nature and Tendency. Fye <HI>Harriet,</HI> &s;ays my La|dy, what does the Girl blu&s;h at? You are hand&s;ome and well-&s;haped, my Dear, and have nothing to be a&s;hamed of, that I know. No one blu&s;hes now a Days, ex|cept &s;illy Country Wenches who are igno|rant of the World. But, if you have any naughty Thoughts that make you blu&s;h, why, keep 'em to your&s;elf Child, and we &s;hall never be the wi&s;er. But, don't let your Face be a Town-Crier, <HI>Harriet,</HI> to let every Body know what you have in your Mind. To be a&s;hamed, my Girl, is the greate&s;t of all Shames.</P>
<P>Again, my Dear, I warn you, that you mu&s;t not be &s;o fond of the Mi&s;s <HI>Colle&s;&s;es,</HI> who u&s;ed to vi&s;it you in the Nur&s;ery. For, though they are good &s;ort of Girls, their Parents are People in but middling Life, and we never admit 'em when there's Company in the Hou&s;e. And then, there's the Mi&s;s <HI>Sanclairs,</HI> how low you curt&s;ied
<PB N="122" REF="121">to 'em Ye&s;terday: and what a Rout you made about welcoming and entertaining them; but, let me have no more of that, for though they are rich, they are Cits, and People of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and a Nod of your Head, or Inclination toward a Curt&s;y, with &s;ome Ye&s;es and Noes when they a&s;k you a Que&s;tion, will be Matter enough of Salute and Di&s;cour&s;e from you to them.</P>
<P>You &s;ay that your Stays are too low be|fore, and that they pain you about the Wa&s;te; but I know it is impo&s;&s;ible; for a young Lady mu&s;t never di&s;like or be pained, by any Thing that &s;hews the Finene&s;s of her Skin or Shape to Advan|tage.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t further advi&s;e you, <HI>Harriet,</HI> not to heap &s;uch Mountains of Sugar, nor to pour &s;uch a Deluge of Cream into your Tea; People will certainly take you for the Daughter of a Dairy-Maid. There is young <HI>Jenny Quirp,</HI> who is a Lady, by Birth, and &s;he has brought her&s;elf to the Perfection of never &s;uffering the Tincture of her Tea to be &s;poiled by Whitening, nor the Flavour to be adulterated by a Grain of Sweet. And then you &s;ay you can't like Coffee; and I could not but laugh, though I was quite a&s;ham'd at the wry Faces you made the other Day, when you mi&s;took the Olives for Sweetmeats.
<PB N="123" REF="122">But the&s;e Things, my Child, are reli&s;hed by Per&s;ons of Ta&s;te, and you mu&s;t force your&s;elf to &s;wallow and reli&s;h them, al&s;o.</P>
<P>I was talking awhile ago of young Lady <HI>Jane Quirp.</HI> There's a Pattern for you, <HI>Harriet;</HI> one who never likes or di&s;likes, or &s;ays or does any Thing a Hair's Breadth beyond the Pink of the Mode. She is ugly, it is true, and very ill-natured; but then &s;he is finely bred, and has all the be|coming Airs of a Mi&s;s of Di&s;tinction. Her you mu&s;t love, my Child, and to her you mu&s;t pay your Court; for you mu&s;t learn to love and prefer &s;uch Matters and Per&s;ons, alone, as will &s;erve, in the Beau-Monde, to render you noted and re&s;pected for the Accompli&s;hments in vogue.</P>
<P>The&s;e Le&s;&s;ons and Efforts, in Time, have their Influence. Mi&s;s comes to accommo|date her Ta&s;te, and Reli&s;h of Things, to the Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h of tho&s;e whom &s;he is proud to re&s;emble. She now is a&s;hamed of Nothing, but in Proportion as it is be|low the Top of the Mode; and &s;he blu&s;h|es at no Indecency that Fa&s;hion is plea&s;ed to adopt. Her whole Soul and E&s;&s;ence is futilized and extracted into Shew and Su|perficials. She learns that Friend&s;hip, in high Life, is nothing but Compliment; and Vi&s;its, Intimacies, and Connections,
<PB N="124" REF="123">the polite Grimace of People of Di&s;tincti|on. That, to talk elegantly upon No|thing, is the Sum of Conver&s;ation. That Beauty and Dre&s;s are the Con&s;tituents of female Perfection. And that the more we depreciate and detract from others, the more eminently we our&s;elves &s;hall &s;hine forth and be exalted. She is follow|ed by Fops, &s;he is wor&s;hipped by Fortune|hunters. She is mounted aloft upon the Wings of Flattery, and is hardened again&s;t public Opinion by Self conceit. While &s;he beholds a circling Group, of the Tay|lor's Creation, admiring the Harmony of her Motions, the Finene&s;s of her Com|plexion, and the Lu&s;tre of her Ornaments, the &s;ame Vanity, that bids her to be de|&s;irous of Conque&s;ts, bids her al&s;o to de|&s;pi&s;e them: But, for the vulgar World, &s;he regards it as the Du&s;t beneath her Steps, created to no End, &s;ave to be look|ed down upon, and trodden under Foot.</P>
<P>Will ye now affirm, or can ye conceive, that any Trace of native Ba&s;hfulne&s;s and Lowline&s;s &s;hould remain in the Frontlet of this Piece of Court-Petrefaction? No &s;uch Trace can remain.</P>
<P>As I ob&s;erved to ye before, that every Affection of the human Soul has its di&s;|tinct and re&s;pective Interpreter in the
<PB N="125" REF="124">Countenance; I am further to take No|tice that each, of tho&s;e many Interpreters, hath its re&s;pective Set of Tubes and Fibres leading thereto, through which the Blood and Spirits flow on their re&s;pective Emoti|on. Thus, whatever the general Tenour of a Per&s;on's Temper may be, &s;uch as joyous, or melancholy, ira&s;cible, or placid, and &s;o forth; the Ve&s;&s;els, relative to the&s;e Affections, are kept open and full, by an almo&s;t con&s;tant Flow of the Blood and animal Spirits, and impre&s;s &s;uch evident Characters of that Per&s;on's Di&s;po&s;ition, as are not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, except for a Time, and that too by &s;ome powerful and oppo&s;ite Pa&s;&s;ion. For the Mu&s;cles, &s;o em|ploy'd, grow &s;tronger and more con&s;picu|ous by Exerci&s;e; as we &s;ee the Legs of a Chairman, and the Shoulders of a Porter, derive Bulk and Di&s;tinction from the Pe|culiarity of their Occupation.</P>
<P>Now, I will take the Argument in the &s;tronge&s;t Light again&s;t my&s;elf. I will &s;up|po&s;e a Man to be naturally of a melan|choly Ca&s;t of Countenance; that he has the additional unhappine&s;s of a bileous Con&s;titution; and, that he is confirmed in this Look and Habit of De&s;pondence, by a Train of di&s;tre&s;sful Circum&s;tances, till he arrives at his twentieth or thirtieth Year. I will then &s;uppo&s;e that his Habit of Body, and Temper of Mind are totally
<PB N="126" REF="125">changed, by Medicine, a Flow of Succe&s;s, a happy Turn of Rea&s;on and Re&s;ignation, or perhaps of Complacence in the divine Di&s;pen&s;ations. He now grows &s;ociable, benevolent, chearful, always joyous when in Company and placid when alone. I a&s;k, on this Occa&s;ion, will ye continue to &s;ee the &s;ame Ca&s;t and Habit of Melancho|ly in this Man's Countenance? No more than ye can &s;ee the Gloom of la&s;t Winter, in the &s;miling Serene of a Summer's-Even|ing. For &s;ome Time, I admit, it will be difficult for the Set of joyous Mu&s;cles, and Glances, to overpower their Adver&s;aries who have &s;o long kept the Field; but, in the End, they mu&s;t prevail; they will re|ceive con&s;tant Supplies, from within; and the Pa&s;&s;ages, for their Reinforcement, will be opened more and more; while their Opponents daily &s;ub&s;ide, give Place, and di&s;appear.</P>
<P>What I have ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to Melancholy, may be equally affirmed of any other Affection, who&s;e oppo&s;ite gets an habitual Empire in the Mind. I &s;ay habitual, becau&s;e there are &s;ome Per&s;ons of &s;uch variable and fluctuating Tempers, now furious, now complacent; now chur|li&s;h, now generous; now mopingly me|lancholy, now merry to Madne&s;s; now pious, now profane; now cruelly hard|hearted, now meltingly humane; that a
<PB N="127" REF="126">Man can no more judge of what Nature or Di&s;po&s;ition &s;uch People are, than he can determine what Wind &s;hall predomi|nate next <HI>April;</HI> and yet, when the Wind blows, he can tell by every Cloud and Weather Cock, from what Point it comes; and may as ea&s;ily decypher the pre&s;ent Temper, by the A&s;pect.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Arabella,</HI> might not Na|ture impre&s;s, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Socrates,</HI> &s;uch con&s;picuous Characters of Vice (in his peculiar Ca&s;t of Countenance and &s;trong Turn of mu&s;cling) as no internal Virtues &s;hould be able to retract?</P>
<P>By no means Madam, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> For, if &s;uch Characters are im|pre&s;&s;ed by Nature on the Countenance, in|dependent of any &s;uch Characters in the Mind, this would, fir&s;t, overthrow the whole Sy&s;tem of the Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts, who judged of the Mind by the Countenance alone. And, &s;econdly, it would ower|throw the Opinion of <HI>Socrates</HI> him&s;elf, who allowed that his Countenance had re|ceived &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions from the natural Bent and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Mind. But, again, if the Mind has really a Power to impre&s;s her own Character or Likene&s;s on the Countenance; what &s;hould take away this Power, why does &s;he not retain it? Why &s;hould not a total Change of Cha|racter
<PB N="128" REF="127">in the Soul, make &s;ome &s;uitable Change of Character in the A&s;pect? It does, Madam, it does make a total Change. And there are thou&s;ands of Faces, in yon|der &s;anctified City, that, once, expre&s;&s;ed all the Sweetne&s;s of ba&s;hful Mode&s;ty; and yet are, now, as much hardened and bronzed over with Impudence; as the Face of the Statue at <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;oft and pliable Features of In|fancy and Youth, the Mind can expre&s;s it|&s;elf with much more Force and Per&s;picui|ty, than in the Features of People more advanced in Years. The Nerves and Fi|bres, in our early Age, are all open, ac|tive, and animated; They reach to the outward Surface of the Skin; and the Soul looks forth, and is &s;een through them, as a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Beauty is &s;een through a Veil of Gauze. But Time de&s;troys many of the&s;e intelligible Fibres; it al&s;o ob&s;tructs others; and it renders the Remainder le&s;s &s;u&s;cepti|ble of tho&s;e Offices and mental Impre&s;&s;ions, for which they were ordained; till the Sur|face of the Countenance grows &s;o callous and rigid, that the Beauties of the Soul can no more be di&s;covered through it, than the Luminaries of Heaven through an Atmo&s;phere of Clouds. Scarce any Thing, &s;ave &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion, can then be di&s;cernible, like Fla&s;hes of Lightening that break through the Gloom.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="128">
For this very Rea&s;on, my dear Mrs. <HI>Clement,</HI> were it po&s;&s;ible for you to advance in Virtues, as you advance in Years; you will however grow le&s;s amiable in the Eyes of Mortals, as your Beauties will be, more and more, &s;hut in from their Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>This brings me to my la&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant Remark, on the Nature and Power of Beauty, it&s;elf. And here we mu&s;t note that, though Nothing can be affectingly lovely or dete&s;table, that does not ari&s;e from &s;ome Sentiment of the Soul, there is yet, in many Faces, &s;uch a natural Sym|metry or Di&s;proportion, as is generally called by the Name of Beauty, and Ugli|ne&s;s. Thus, in &s;ome Countenances, you perceive a due Relation and Agreement between the Parts. While in others, the Forehead may overwhelm the nether Face; or the Mouth threaten to devour the other Features; or the No&s;e may ap|pear as a huge Steeple that hides a &s;mall Church; or, as a Mountain that is the whole of a Man's E&s;tate; in&s;omuch that, as &s;ome may be &s;aid to want a No&s;e to their Face, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e they may be &s;aid to want a Face to their No&s;e. But this Species of Beauty and Ugline&s;s excites no other kind of Plea&s;ure or Di&s;|gu&s;t &s;ave &s;uch as we receive from two
<PB N="130" REF="129">Pieces of Architecture, where one is exe|cuted with Propriety, and the other is ob|viou&s;ly out of all Rule. And, to continue the Simile, if People &s;hould be &s;een look|ing out at the Windows of tho&s;e two Buildings; we may come to dete&s;t and avoid the Fir&s;t, and to love and frequent the Latter, for the Sake of tho&s;e who live therein. And ju&s;t &s;o it is, with regular Faces that expre&s;s a Deformity of Soul; and, with di&s;proportioned Features that may, however, be pregnant with the Beauty of Sentiment.</P>
<P>By Beauty, therefore, I do not mean the Beauty of Lines, or Angles; of Moti|on, or Mu&s;ic; of Form, or Colour; of numerical Agreements, or Geometrical Proportions; nor that which excites the Pa&s;&s;ion, of &s;ome pragmatical Inamoratos, for a Shell, a Tulip, or a Butter-fly. All the&s;e have, undoubtedly, their peculiar Beauty; but, then, that Beauty has no Relation to the Power or Perception of that which contains it; it is derived from &s;omething that is, altogether, foreign; and owes the whole of its Merit to the &s;upe|rior Art and Influence of God or Man.</P>
<P>In the De&s;ignings of Sculptors, of Pain|ters and Statuaries, we, however, &s;ee very great and truly affecting Beauty. I have, at times, been melted into Tears thereby;
<PB N="131" REF="130">and have felt within my Bo&s;om the actual Emotions of Di&s;tre&s;s, and Compa&s;&s;ion, of Friend&s;hip and of Love. I a&s;k then what it was that excited the&s;e Sen&s;ations? Could any Lines, Colourings, or mere Symmetry of inanimate Parts, in&s;pire Affections, of which in them&s;elves they were incapable? No. They could only &s;erve, as the Ve|hicles of &s;omething intended to in&s;pire &s;uch Sen&s;ibilities, nothing further. We mu&s;t, therefore, look higher for a Cau&s;e more adequate to &s;uch extraordinary Effects; and the fir&s;t that pre&s;ents it&s;elf is the De|&s;igner, who mu&s;t have conceived amiable Sentiments within him&s;elf, before he could impre&s;s their Beauty on the&s;e his Interpre|ters, in order to excite &s;uitable Affections in others.</P>
<P>Here then it is evident that, whatever we affect or love, in the De&s;ign, is no o|ther than the Sentiment or Soul of the De&s;igner; though we neither &s;ee nor know any Thing further concerning him. And thus, a Sculptor, a Painter, a Statu|ary, or amiable Author, by conveying their Sentiments, in la&s;ting and intelligible Characters to Mankind, may make the World Admirers and Lovers of their Beau|ty, when their Features &s;hall be rigid and incapable of Expre&s;&s;ion, and, when they them&s;elves &s;hall no longer exi&s;t among Men.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="131">
From hence it &s;hould &s;eem, as indeed I am fully per&s;uaded, that Mind can affect|ingly love nothing but Mind; and, that univer&s;al Nature can exhibit no &s;ingle Grace or Beauty, that does not ari&s;e from Sentiment alone.</P>
<P>The Power of this &s;entimental Beauty, as I may &s;ay, is, in many Ca&s;es, great, amazing! and has not yet been accounted for, that I know of, by any Philo&s;opher, Poet, or Author; tho' &s;everal have made it their peculiar Study and Subject. We have &s;een, and read of many In&s;tances, where it carries People, as it were, quite out of them&s;elves; and gives them to live, and to be intere&s;ted, in the Object of their Affections alone. They will run to fight, bleed, &s;uffer, and even to die in its De|fence. And in its Ab&s;ence, they will pine, and de&s;pair, and attempt to de&s;troy them|&s;elves, rather than bear to be divided from what they love, in a Manner, above their own Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>This is wonderful, perhaps my&s;terious! and may po&s;&s;ibly be involved in impenetra|ble Darkne&s;s. Let us try however if we can throw any probable Lights upon it.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een that human Ar|tificers can impre&s;s the Beauty of their
<PB N="133" REF="132">own Sentiments on their inanimate Works. Suppo&s;e, then, that God &s;hould be barely the &s;ame to univer&s;al Nature, that a finite De&s;igner is to the Piece he has in Hand. He finds that the Stuff or Material, which he is to form and to inform, is, in it&s;elf, utterly incapable of any Thing that is beautiful, and con&s;equently incapable of any Thing that is de&s;irable. He, there|fore, finds him&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of imparting to his Works, &s;ome faint Ma|nife&s;tation or Similitude of Him&s;elf; for otherwi&s;e they cannot be amiable; neither can he &s;ee his Shadow in them with any Delight. On Matter therefore, he, fir&s;t, impre&s;&s;es &s;uch di&s;tant Characters of his own Beauty, as the Subject will bear; in the Glory of the Heavens, in the Move|ment of the Planets, in the Symmetry of Form, in the Harmony of Sounds, in the Elegance of Colours, in the elaborate Tex|ture of the &s;malle&s;t Leaf; and, in the in|finitely fine Mechani&s;m of &s;uch In&s;ects, and Minims of Nature, as are &s;carce vi&s;i|ble to Eyes of the cleare&s;t Di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>But, when God comes toward Home, if the Phra&s;e may be allowed; when he impre&s;&s;es on intelligent Spirits a nearer Re&s;emblance of him&s;elf, and imparts to them, al&s;o, a Perception and Reli&s;h of the Beauty, with which he has inform'd them,
<PB N="134" REF="133">he then delights to behold, and will eter|nally delight to behold his Image, &s;o fair|ly reflected by &s;uch a living Mirror. Yet, &s;till, they are no other than his own Beauties that he beholds in his Works; for, his Omnipotence can impre&s;s, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly detach a &s;ingle Grace from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am not quite &s;ingular in this Opinion. I have &s;omewhere read the following Stanza.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>'Tis</HI> Goodne&s;s <HI>forms the</HI> Beauty <HI>of the Face,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Line of</HI> Virtue <HI>is the Line of</HI> Grace.</L>
</LG>
<P>Here is al&s;o a little Poem, lately pub|li&s;hed on a Lady, who was beholden to the Graces of her Mind alone for all the Attractions of her Per&s;on and Countenance.</P>
<LG>
<L>What is Beauty? is it Form,</L>
<L>Proportion, Colours pale or warm?</L>
<L>Or is it, as by &s;ome defin'd,</L>
<L>A Creature of the Lover's Mind?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No &mdash; It is internal Grace</L>
<L>Pregnant in the Form and Face;</L>
<L>The Sentiment that's hear'd, and &s;een,</L>
<L>In Act, and Manners, Voice, and Mein;</L>
<L>It is the Soul's caele&s;tial Ray,</L>
<L>Breaking through the Veil of Clay;</L>
<L>'Tis the Godhead, in the Heart,</L>
<L>Touching each external Part;</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="134">
Wrapt in Matter, el&s;e too bright</L>
<L>For our Sen&s;e, and for our Sight.</L>
<L>BEAUTY (Envy be thou dumb)</L>
<L>Is DIVINITY in &mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>Here we reach at the Nature of that Enchantment, or Magneti&s;m, with which &s;ome Per&s;ons are &s;o powerfully indued, as to engage the Liking of all who barely be|hold them; an Enchantment often attrac|tive of Friend&s;hip, Affection, Pa&s;&s;ion, to Tenderne&s;s, Langui&s;hment, Pain, Sick|ne&s;s, and Death.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o we di&s;cover why the Bli&s;s, which we reach after, eludes our Gra&s;p; why it vani&s;hes, as it were, in the Mo|ment of Enjoyment, yet &s;till continues to fa&s;cinate and attract as before; fora&s;much as the BEAUTY, after which we &s;igh, is not e&s;&s;entially in the Mirror where we be|hold its Similitude. Thus, <HI>Ixion</HI> is &s;aid to have cla&s;ped a Cloud, without reflecting that it was but a bare Re&s;emblance of the real Divinity who had excited his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This will at once account for all the won|derful Effects of Beauty. For, if nothing but GOD is lovely, if nothing el&s;e can be beloved; he is him&s;elf the univer&s;al and irre&s;i&s;table Magnet, that draws all intelli|gent and affectionate Beings, through the Medium of Creatures, to the Graces of
<PB N="136" REF="135">their Creator; till the Veil &s;hall finally be taken away, and that he him&s;elf &s;hall ap|pear, in his eternal, unclouded and un|&s;peakable Beauty, infinitely lovely and in|finitely beloved.</P>
<P>But, I have out talked my Time, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> ri&s;ing, and looking at his Watch. I am engaged for an Hour or two above Street, and wi&s;h ye a good Evening.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was abroad. <HI>Ned,</HI> who would not willingly have exchanged his Unluckine&s;s for the Heir&s;hip of an E&s;|tate, happened to take a little Ramble through the Town. He held a Stick, to the End of which he had a long Ferule of hollow Tin, which he could take off at Plea&s;ure; and, from the Extremity of the Ferule, there aro&s;e a &s;mall collateral Pipe, in an Angle of about forty five Degrees. He had filled this Ferule with Puddle|water; which, by a &s;udden Pre&s;&s;ure of the Stick, he could &s;quirt out, to double the Height of his own Stature.</P>
<P>On his Return, he &s;aw an an elderly Gentleman advancing, who&s;e Shadow, be|ing lengthened by the declining Sun, at|tended, with a &s;low and &s;tately Motion. As <HI>Ned</HI> approached, he exclaimed, with a
<PB N="137" REF="136">well counterfeited Fear, look, look! what's that behind you? take Care of your&s;elf, Sir, for Heaven's &s;ake, take Care!</P>
<P>The Gentleman, alarmed hereat, in|&s;tantly &s;tarted, turned pale, and looked terrified behind him, and on either Side; when <HI>Ned,</HI> recovering his Countenance, &s;aid, O Sir, I beg Pardon, I believe it's nothing but your Shadow. What Sirrah, cried the Gentleman, in a Tone highly exa&s;perated, have you learned no better Manners than to banter your Superiors? and then, lifting a Kane Switch, he gave our merry Companion a few &s;mart Strokes acro&s;s the Shoulders.</P>

<P>I think for my&s;elf, but I &s;peak for the People. I may think as I plea&s;e, for I under&s;tand my own Thoughts; but, would I be under&s;tood when I &s;peak to o|thers al&s;o, I mu&s;t &s;peak with the People, I mu&s;t &s;peak in common Terms according to their common or general Acceptation.</P>
<P>There is no Term, in our Language, more common than that of <HI>Gentleman;</HI> and, whenever it is heard, all agree in the general Idea of a Man &s;ome way elevated above the Vulgar. Yet, perhaps no two, living, are preci&s;ely agreed, re&s;pecting the Qualities they think requi&s;ite for con&s;ti|tuting this Character. When we hear the Epithets of a fine <HI>Gentleman,</HI> a <HI>pretty Gen|tleman, much of a Gentleman, Gentlemanlike, &s;omething of a Gentleman, nothing of a Gen|tleman,</HI> and &s;o forth; all the&s;e different Appellations mu&s;t intend a Peculiarity an|nexed to the Ideas of tho&s;e who expre&s;s them; though no two of them, as I &s;aid, may agree in the con&s;tituent Qualities of the Character they have formed in their own Mind.</P>
<P>There have been Ladies who deemed a Bag-Wig, ta&s;&s;eld Wai&s;tcoat, new fa&s;hioned
<PB N="139" REF="138">Snuff-Box, and Sword-Knot, very capital Ingredients in the Compo&s;ition of &mdash; a Gen|tleman.</P>
<P>A certain ea&s;y Impudence acquired by low People, by ca&s;ually being conver&s;ant in high Life, has pa&s;s'd a Man current thro' many Companies for &mdash; a Gentleman.</P>
<P>In the Country a laced Hat and long Whip makes &mdash; a Gentleman.</P>
<P>In Taverns and in Brothels, he who is the mo&s;t of a Bully is the mo&s;t of &mdash; a Gentleman.</P>
<P>With Heralds, every E&s;quire is, indi&s;|putably, &mdash; a Gentleman.</P>
<P>And the Highway Man, in his Manner of taking your Pur&s;e; and your Friend, in his Manner of debauching your Wife, may however be allowed to have &mdash; much of the Gentleman.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you &s;ay, my Friend, our Ideas of this Matter are very various and ad|ver&s;e. In our own Minds, perhaps, they are al&s;o indetermined; and I que&s;tion if any Man has formed, to him&s;elf, a Con|ception of this Character with &s;ufficient
<PB N="140" REF="139">Preci&s;ion. Pray &mdash; was there any &s;uch Character among the Philo&s;ophers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aut.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Plato,</HI> among the Philo&s;ophers, was <HI>the mo&s;t of a Man of Fa&s;hion;</HI> and therefore allowed, at the Court of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> to be &mdash; <HI>the mo&s;t of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;eriou&s;ly, I apprehend that this Cha|racter is pretty much upon the Modern. In all ancient or dead Languages we have no Term, any way adequate, whereby we may expre&s;s it. In the Habits, Manners, and Characters, of old <HI>Sparta</HI> and old <HI>Rome,</HI> we find an Antipathy to all the Ele|ments of modern Gentility. Among tho&s;e rude and unpoli&s;hed People, you read of Philo&s;ophers, of Orators, Patriots, He|roes, and Demigods; but you never hear of any Character &s;o elegant as that of &mdash; <HI>a pretty Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>When tho&s;e Nations, however, became refined into what their Ance&s;tors would have called Corruption. When Luxury introduced, and Fa&s;hion gave a Sanction to certain Sciences, which <HI>Cynics</HI> would have branded with the illmannered Ap|pellations of Debauchery, Drunkenne&s;s, Whoredom, Gambling, Cheating, Lying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Practitioners a&s;&s;umed the new Ti|tle of <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> till &s;uch <HI>Gentlemen</HI> became as plenteous as Stars in the Milky-Way,
<PB N="141" REF="140">and lo&s;t Di&s;tinction merely by the Con|fluence of their Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as the &s;aid Qualities were found to be of ready Acqui&s;ition, and of ea&s;y De&s;cent to the Populace from their Betters, Ambition judg'd it nece&s;&s;ary to add further Marks and Criterions, for &s;e|vering the general Herd from the nobler Species &mdash; <HI>of Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, if the Commonalty were ob&s;erved to have a Propen&s;ity to Religion; their Superiors affected a Di&s;dain of &s;uch vulgar Prejudices; and a Freedom that ca&s;t off the Re&s;traints of Morality, and a Cou|rage that &s;purned at the Fear of a God, were accounted the di&s;tingui&s;hing Charac|teri&s;tics of &mdash; <HI>a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>If the Populace, as in <HI>China,</HI> were in|du&s;trious and ingenious, the Grandees, by the Length of their Nails and the cramping of their Limbs, gave Evidence that true Dignity was above Labour or Utility, and that to be born to no End was the Prero|gative &mdash; <HI>of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>If the common Sort, by their Conduct, declare a Re&s;pect for the In&s;titutions of civil Society and good Government; their Betters de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch pu&s;illanimous Confor|mity, and the Magi&s;trates pay becoming
<PB N="142" REF="141">Regard to the Di&s;tinction, and allow of the &s;uperior Liberties and Privileges &mdash; <HI>of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>If the lower Set &s;hew a Sen&s;e of Com|mon-Hone&s;ty and Common-Order; tho&s;e, who would figure in the World, think it incumbent to demon&s;trate that Compla|cence to Inferiors, common Manners, com|mon Equity, or any Thing common is quite beneath the Attention or Sphere &mdash; <HI>of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as Underlings are ever ambiti|ous of imitating and u&s;urping the Man|ners of their Superiors; and as this State of Mortality is incident to perpetual Change and Revolution; it may happen that when the Populace, by encroaching on the Pro|vince of Gentility, have arrived to their <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of In&s;olence, Debaucherry, Ir|religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Gentry, in order to be again di&s;tingui&s;hed, may a&s;&s;ume the Station that their Inferiors had for&s;aken, and, however ridiculous the Suppo&s;ition may appear at pre&s;ent, <HI>Humanity, Equity, Utility, Compla|cence,</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> may, in Time, come to be the <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;tics &mdash; of a Gentleman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>From what you have &s;aid, it ap|pears that the mo&s;t general Idea, which People have formed of a Gentleman, is
<PB N="143" REF="142">that of a Per&s;on of Fortune, above the Vulgar, and embelli&s;hed by Manners that are fa&s;hionable in high Life. In this Ca&s;e, <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> are the two <HI>con&s;tituent Ingredients</HI> in the Compo&s;ition of modern <HI>Gentlemen;</HI> for, whatever the Fa&s;hion may be, whether moral or immoral, for or a|gain&s;t Rea&s;on, right or wrong, it is e|qually the Duty of a <HI>Gentleman</HI> to con|form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aut.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I apprehend that true Gentility is altogether independent of For|tune or Fa&s;hion, of Time, Cu&s;toms, or Opinions of any Kind. The very &s;ame Qualities that con&s;tituted a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> in the fir&s;t Age of the World, are perma|nently, invariably, and indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Con&s;titution of the &s;ame Character, to the End of Time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>NED was not of a Temper to en|dure much, without attempting at Retaliation; and directing the Pipe of his Ferule to the Front of his Adver&s;ary, he &s;uddenly di&s;charged the full Contents in his Eyes and Face, and upon his Cloath|ing; and, &s;trait taking to his Heels, he hoped to get in at Door, before the Stran|ger could clear his Sight to take Notice where he &s;heltered.</P>
<P><HI>Ned</HI> however happened, at this Time, to be &s;omewhat over &s;anguine in his Ex|pectations. Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> for that was the Name of the Party be&s;pattered, had ju&s;t cleared one Eye, in Sea&s;on, to remark where his Enemy entered; and ha&s;tening Home, he wa&s;hed, undre&s;&s;ed, and &s;hifted his Linen and Cloaths, with le&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion and fewer Cur&s;es by the Half, than he conceived to be due to &s;o outrageous an In&s;ult.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> had him&s;elf been a Humou|ri&s;t, in his Time, and had acquired a pretty Competence by very fa&s;hionable Means; &s;uch as Gambling, bearing Te&s;|timony for a Friend in Di&s;tre&s;s, procuring Intelligence for the Mini&s;try, and Wenches
<PB N="145" REF="144">for the Peerage. He had, &s;ome Years ago, been bullied into Marriage by the Relations of a young Termagant, while he attempted to take &s;uch a Sample of her Charms as might enable him to recom|mend her to an Acquaintance of Quality. She was neither gentle by Nature, nor po|li&s;hed by Education; &s;he liked nothing of her Hu&s;band except his Fortune; and they lived together in a State of perpetual Al|tercation, and mutual Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Old Age, and a quarrel&s;ome Companion for Life, &s;eldom happen to be Sweeteners of the human Temper; and Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> had now acquired &s;uch a Quantum of the Infirmities both of Body and Mind, as might ju&s;tly apologize for a peevi&s;h Di&s;po|&s;ition. He had lately taken a hand&s;ome Hou&s;e on the Hill, for the Benefit of Air. As &s;oon as he had reclaimed him&s;elf from the Pickle into which <HI>Ned</HI> had put him, he &s;ent to enquire the Name and Charac|ter of the Owner of that Hou&s;e where he had taken Refuge; and, being &s;ufficiently apprized of what he wanted to know, he walked toward Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s, ha&s;tening his Pace with the Spirit and Expectation of Revenge.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had arrived but a little be|fore, and de&s;iring to know Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI>'s Commands, he was informed, in Terms
<PB N="146" REF="145">the mo&s;t aggravating and inveterate, of the whole Cour&s;e and Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ned</HI>'s Mi&s;|behaviour. The Delinquent thereupon was called up to in&s;tant Trial. He ho|ne&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed the Facts, but pleaded, in Mitigation, the Beating that Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> had, already, given him. But as Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> did not judge this &s;ufficient to re|form the natural Petulance of a Di&s;po&s;ition that, otherwi&s;e, was not void of Merit; a Rod was immediately brought; and <HI>An|drew</HI> was ordered to hor&s;e, and <HI>Frank</HI> to flog the Criminal in Pre&s;ence of the Party aggrieved.</P>
<P>During this Operation, Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> ob|&s;erved that <HI>Frank</HI>'s Hand did not, altoge|ther, an&s;wer to the Benevolence of his own Heart; whereupon, he furiou&s;ly &s;natched the Rod from him, and began to lay at <HI>Ned</HI> with might and main. Hereat Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ordered <HI>Andrew</HI> to let the Boy down, and ob&s;erving, that he would no further interfere in a Cau&s;e, where the Appellant a&s;&s;umed Judgment and Execution to him&s;elf, he carele&s;ly turned his Back upon Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> and left him to cool his Pa&s;&s;ions by his Evening's Walk homeward.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Ned</HI> was more afraid of Mr. <HI>Fen|ton</HI>'s Di&s;plea&s;ure, than he would have been
<PB N="147" REF="146">of a full Brother to the Whipping he had got. But Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was too generous, to add the Severity of his own Counte|nance to the Weight of <HI>Frank</HI>'s Hand; and <HI>Ned</HI> was quickly rein&s;tated in the good Graces of the Family.</P>
<P>His Genius however returned, with an involuntary Bent, toward obtaining Satis|faction for the Injuries he had received from Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> provided he might re|taliate without fear of Detection; and he was not &s;low in contriving very adequate Means.</P>
<P>There was a Villager in <HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI> a|bout ten Years of Age, who had conceiv|ed an uncommon Kindne&s;s for <HI>Ned,</HI> on account of his Sprightline&s;s, his Wit, and good Humour. To this condoling Friend he had imparted his Grievances; and, on him alone he depended, for Execution of the Project propo&s;ed for Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>On a certain moonle&s;s Night, they mu&s;|tered four tame Cats, and having bound &s;ome Feuze round three or four Inches of the Extremity of each of their Tails, they lodged them together in a Bag; and &s;ome|what after Suppertime, when all the Town was &s;ilent, they marched &s;oftly and cau|tiou&s;ly to the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Snarle.</HI> There <HI>Ned</HI>'s Friend, with his Knife, dext'rou&s;ly

<P>The poor Cats remained &s;ilent, and univer&s;ally inoffen&s;ive, while they felt no Damage. But, as &s;oon as the Fire had &s;eized on their Tails, they began to &s;peak to you in a Language wholly peculiar, as one would think, to Sentiments and Sounds of diabolical Intention.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Snarle</HI> had been jangling over the Fire in an oppo&s;ite Parlour; when their Di&s;pute was &s;uddenly &s;ettled by this Outcry, as they imagined, of a Legion of Infernals. They in&s;tantly &s;tarted up, and ca&s;t a Countenance of pale and contagious Pannic at each other. But <HI>George</HI> the Footman, a &s;trong and bold Fellow, hav|ing ju&s;t before entered on &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to his Ma&s;ter, turned and ran to the Cham|ber from whence the Peal came. He threw open the Door with his wonted In|trepidity; but this was as far as mortal Courage could go; for the Cats, &s;pying a Pa&s;&s;age whereby, as they conceived, they might fly from their Pain, ru&s;hed &s;udden|ly
<PB N="149" REF="150">and jointly on the Face and Brea&s;t of <HI>George,</HI> and back he fell with a Cry of Terror and De&s;peration. On however went the Cats, and flying into the Par|lour, one fa&s;tened a Claw in each Cheek of Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> and, as his Lady &s;creamed out and clapt her Hands before her Face, another fa&s;tened, with four Fangs, on her be&s;t Bru&s;&s;els Head, and rent and tore away after a lamentable Manner.</P>
<P>The Chamber-Maid and Cook, hearing the Uproar from the Kitchen, were afraid to a&s;cend and &s;till more afraid to &s;tay be|low alone. They therefore crept &s;oftly and trembling up Stairs The Torture the Cats were in, did not permit them to be attached to any &s;ingle Object. They had quitted Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Snarle,</HI> and now flew about the Parlour, &s;ma&s;hing, da&s;hing, and overturning Piers, Gla&s;&s;es, and China, and whatever came in their Way, as though it had been the very Palace of Pandaemo|nium it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> was again on his Legs; his Ma&s;|ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s had eloped from the Par|lour, and met the two Maids in the Mid|dle of the Entry. They concluded <HI>nemine con.</HI> to get as &s;peedily, as they might, from the Mini&s;ters of Darkne&s;s, and would wil|lingly have e&s;caped by the Street-Door; but alas this was not po&s;&s;ible; one of the
<PB N="150" REF="151">Devils guarded the Pa&s;s, and clinging to the great Lock with all his Talons, growl|ed and yelled in the Dialect of twenty of the Damned. The Stairs however re|mained open, and up they would have ru&s;hed, but were &s;o enfeebled by their Fright, that this could not be done in the Way of a Race.</P>
<P>As they mounted, by the Help of the Walls and the Bani&s;ters; &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Snarle</HI> to her Mate, in a languid and &s;oft Voice, my Dear, and my Jewel, 'tis all along of you that I am thus haunted, your old Friend, I find, makes no Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons; and, when he comes to take you Home, as come he will, 'tis twenty to one but he takes me for Company. Indeed, my Angel, cries Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> in a Tone of like Complacence, I &s;hould much rather he would be plea&s;ed to take me &s;ingle, wherever it may be his good Plea&s;ure to carry me; for, I know of nothing that I have done &s;o heinous neither, to have one Damnation heaped on the Top of the other.</P>
<P>Having &s;caled as far as the Dining-Room, they all entered and bolted the Door, and Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> opening a Window, &s;aw a large Po&s;&s;e of Neighbours who had gathered below. What is the Matter, Sir, cried one of them, what is the mean|ing
<PB N="151" REF="152">of this horrible Uproar and Din? one would think that Hell was empty, and that all its Inhabitants were come to keep Car|nival in your Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>O, a Ladder, a Ladder, cries Mr. <HI>Snarle;</HI> deliver us, good People, good Chri&s;tian People; a Ladder, we be&s;eech ye, a Lad|der, a Ladder! that indeed, cries a Wag, is the la&s;t good Turn an hone&s;t Fellow has Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>The Ladder was &s;oon brought, and this Panic-&s;tricken Family were helped down and, charitably, conducted to the great Inn of St. <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Dragon,</HI> where, with the help of Sack Whey, warm Beds, and their remaining Terrors, they got a hearty Sweat, and were &s;omewhat com|po&s;ed by Ten o'Clock next Morning. They then got up, and having breakfa&s;ted on a Pot of milled Chocolate, they hurried to <HI>London,</HI> without adventuring to &s;end to the haunted Man&s;ion, for any Change of Cloaths or Linen; for, they would rather have put on Garments that had been dipt in the Blood of <HI>Ne&s;&s;us,</HI> than have touched any Thing in a Hou&s;e of which, with the Furniture, Plate, Bedding, and other Ap|purtenances, the Devil, as they conceived, had taken legal and full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
In truth, there was &s;carce an Inhabitant of the whole Town of <HI>Ham&s;tead,</HI> who differed in Opinion on this Head, in&s;o|much that, as Day after Day began gra|dually to &s;hut in, all People, who had Oc|ca&s;ion to pa&s;s by the Dwelling of the late ejected Mr. <HI>Snarle,</HI> kept more and more aloof to the oppo&s;ite Side of the Way, in Proportion as their Apprehen&s;ions encrea&s;ed with the Darkne&s;s. And all Things in the Hou&s;e remained as &s;afe from Depreda|tion, as though they had been guarded by a Regiment of Dragoons.</P>
<P>Imaginary Howlings were heard by the whole Neighbourhood, and &s;till continued to i&s;&s;ue from thence Night by Night. And it was as firmly believed, as it was currently reported, that while Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> made his E&s;cape through the Window, <HI>Satan</HI> clawed off a Collop from his Po&s;teriors, in earne&s;t of his Carca&s;s in Remainder, on a further Day.</P>
<P>The Cats, in the mean Time, lived plentifully and at free Co&s;t on the cold Meats which they found in the Kitchen and Larder; and, as the Angui&s;h of their Tails was now no more remembered, they kept undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their new Acqui&s;ition, &s;o that, during their Re&s;i|dence, not even a Mou&s;e was &s;tirring.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154">
In about a Week after Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI>'s De|parture for <HI>London,</HI> he &s;ent an Undertaker, and a Friend on whom he depended, with Authority to enter the haunted Hou&s;e, to take an Inventory of all the Effects, and to &s;ell them to the Inhabitants by public Auction. They accordingly borrowed a Ladder, and got in at the &s;ame Window by which the Family got out. They found all quiet; and, &s;tepping &s;omewhat timo|rou&s;ly down Stairs, they opened the Street and back Doors, and Parlour Windows, and then prevailed upon two or three re|putable Neighbours to enter, and witne&s;s the Inventory they were going to take.</P>
<P>The Cats, in the mean Time, finding all late Impediments and Embargoes re|moved, &s;lunk &s;ilently and unperceived a|way; and retreated in excellent Plight to their re&s;pective Habitations. Though <HI>Gammar Gruff</HI> and <HI>Goody Gurton,</HI> gave many a Cur&s;e to the Rats, who had &s;o flead and mauled the Tails of their Tab|bies.</P>
<P>The Inventory being ended, public No|tice was given throughout the Town, of the Sale to begin preci&s;ely at Ten the fol|lowing Morning. At the Hour appointed, there was &s;carce a living Animal left to continue the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Hou&s;e in
<PB N="154" REF="155"><HI>Ham&s;tead.</HI> All crouded to &s;ee the Goods and Chattels of the Devil &s;old according to Law. The Auctioneer mounted his oratorial Eminence, and pranced and pa|raded for Half an Hour, like the Sign of the <HI>Flying-Hor&s;e</HI> in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> without pro|ceeding a Foot in the Bu&s;ine&s;s on which he came. Sir, Madam, good intelligent People, ob&s;erve! ob&s;erve, I &s;ay, you Ta|ble; what a Beauty, what an admirable Curio&s;ity is there! that Table, Gentlemen and Ladies, is all of virgin Yew, taken pure and undefiled from its native Fore&s;t. There's a Complexion, there's a Poli&s;h! it is a Looking Gla&s;s, in which, the fa|vourite <HI>Sultana,</HI> or Daughter of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> might behold every Charm re|flected with Advantage. Note the Variety of its Tints, the Luxuriance of its Vein|ings. How prodigal Nature has been, in expending on this favourite Piece of Ve|getation, &s;uch a Number of Excellencies, &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Beauties! Neither has Art fallen &s;hort of the Graces and Perfec|tions of Nature herein. Mark the Ta&s;te, the Manner, the Mouldings; how jointed and framed together, as one organized Body. The Operator no Doubt took a Plea&s;ure, by his Workman&s;hip, to rival the Beauties of the Subject on which he wrought. &mdash; I &s;et it up at five Guineas &mdash; What is five Guineas, my Friends? &mdash; Not the Half of what ye will bid at
<PB N="155" REF="156">the &s;econd Word &mdash; and, what is five times five Guineas, to the intrin&s;ic Value? &mdash; The Curious, indeed, have nothing &s;o rare in their Cabinets &mdash; Neither ever had Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> or any of the Knights of the famous Round-Table, the Honour of &s;itting round &s;uch a Table as this.

<P>Ay, ay, thought all pre&s;ent, the Devil, the Devil! that is the Ca&s;e indeed. And thus, our Orator might have been preach|ing, like Saint <HI>Anthony</HI> to the Fi&s;hes, till the Day of Doom; before any of his dumb Auditors would have returned a Word of An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Fact is that, as the Devil was a Per&s;onage, however re&s;pectable, with whom the well-meaning Inhabitants of this an|cient Village did not chu&s;e to have any Manner of Dealings; neither de&s;ired to go Snacks, in Matters of Property, with Be|ings whom they held much wi&s;er than them|&s;elves,
<PB N="156" REF="157">and of who&s;e Hone&s;ty they had but a very &s;lender Opinion; the&s;e Agents of Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> were obliged to return, ju&s;t as rich as they came, their Reckoning de|ducted; and Mr. <HI>Snarle</HI> &s;oon found him&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ing of tho&s;e, his que&s;tionable Commodities, at le&s;s than half Value to &s;ome <HI>London</HI> Undertakers. But, what he lo&s;t, in Point of Property, he gained in Matter of Morals; for he grew extremely cautious of adding to the Mea&s;ure of his former Iniquities, for fear of another Vi&s;it from his recent Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> could not but be fre|quently apprized of the&s;e Prodigies and Alarms, that kept all <HI>Ham&s;tead</HI> waking, and nightly grouped every Family into a &s;ingle Room. He compared, in his own Mind, the Di&s;comfiture and Bani&s;hment of the unfortunate <HI>Snarle,</HI> with the Circum|&s;tances of the Provocation which <HI>Ned</HI> had received. He found that all an&s;wered, as well in Point of Time, as to <HI>Ned</HI>'s natural Unluckine&s;s and Talents at Invention. Yet he could &s;carce conceive how a Child, little more than eight Years of Age, &s;hould be capable of contriving Mi&s;chiefs, &s;o for|midable in the Execution, and &s;o exten&s;ive in their Con&s;equences. Now <HI>Ned</HI> was &s;o happy, on this &s;ingular Occa&s;ion, that no|thing tran&s;pired. Wherefore, as Mr. <HI>Fen|ton</HI> could produce no Manner of Proof,
<PB N="157" REF="158">was too delicate to a&s;k any Que&s;tions on the Ca&s;e, le&s;t, on one Hand, he &s;hould tempt the Boy into a Lye; or, on the other, be obliged to cha&s;ti&s;e, or check him for Faults that his Genero&s;ity might induce him to confe&s;s.</P>
<P>Matters, therefore, with Re&s;pect to <HI>Ned,</HI> pre&s;erved their State of Tranquillity; though Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> would often view him with an Eye of Wonder and Su&s;picion; and could hardly bring him&s;elf to believe that a Boy of his extraordinary Genius, &s;hould be no other by Birth than a Beg|gar's Brat. But here, pardon me, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> if I di&s;&s;ent from your Opinion. With humble Deference to your Judg|ment in other Matters, I conceive that an Infant, begot on a Dunghill, brought forth in a Pig&s;tye, and &s;wathed with a rot|ten Remnant of the Covering of an A&s;s, may have Talents and Capacity above the Son of an Emperor.</P>

<SPEAKER>Author.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great Teutonic Theo&s;o|pher, <HI>Jacob Behmen,</HI> affirms that a Father begets the Soul as well as Body of his Child; and this &s;trongly coincides with your Judgment of the Matter. All ani|mal Nature al&s;o concurs in the &s;ame Po&s;i|tion; and the Offspring of a Lion, an Eagle, and an A&s;s, invariably partake of the Qualities of their Progenitors.</P>
<P>In the very early Ages of Mankind; when Honour, and Empire, Precedence, and Station were a&s;&s;ign'd to &s;uperior Merit alone, to Prowe&s;s in the Field, or Wi&s;|dom in the Council; it is but natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the more immediate De&s;cen|dents, of &s;uch Heroes or Patriots, inhe|rited, in a great Mea&s;ure, the Beauty, Strength, Genius, and Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e from whom they &s;prung. But &s;ome thou|&s;ands of Years are now pa&s;&s;ed, my good Sir, &s;ince all this Matter has been totally rever&s;ed; and the World affords but very rare In&s;tances, where <HI>Wa&s;herwomen,</HI> or <HI>Shepherds,</HI> where a <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> or
<PB N="159" REF="160"><HI>Kouli-Kan</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Theodore</HI> of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> by the mere Force of Genius, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves from Ob&s;curity to Dominion. The&s;e In&s;tances, al&s;o are very far from making any Thing in Favour of your Ar|gument; though, unque&s;tionably, were you to write their Romance, you would, agreeable to your The&s;is, derive their re|&s;pective Pedigree from the Queen's of <HI>Utopia,</HI> or &s;ome Emperors in <HI>Terra au&s;|tralis incognita.</HI></P>
<P>When Time was young, when Men were re&s;pected and advanced (as I &s;aid) according to their per&s;onal Di&s;tinctions and Accompli&s;hments, uncommon Beauty, Strength, and Agility of Body, informed by &s;uperior Genius and Talents, were ac|counted genuine Proofs of a royal or noble De&s;cent. But, in Proce&s;s of Years, when Art had introduced Luxury, and Luxury had introduced Corruption among the Great, a feeble di&s;temper'd Frame, in|formed by a per&s;er&s;e pu&s;illanimous and impatient Temper, became an Indication, by no Means improbable of the genuine De&s;cent of a Child of Quality.</P>

<P>With all Deference and due Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e who &s;it in the Seat of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or in the Throne of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> when we &s;peak as Philo&s;ophers, we &s;hould &s;peak independent of vulgar Prejudice.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible of that internal Re|&s;pect which the World is pleas'd to pay to external Luftre. If one Man acquires a Crown, another a red Hat, and another a Coronet, by Means that de&s;erved the Gibbet of <HI>Haman;</HI> they in&s;tantly become the pre&s;umptive Proprietors of I know not what Catalogue of fine Qualities and Ac|compli&s;hments. Wherefore, as I am &s;o &s;ingular, &s;o perver&s;e, or &s;o unhappy, as to differ from the Judgment of &s;o wi&s;e a World in this Matter, it is the more in|cumbent upon me to bring Proofs that are &s;elf-evident, at the &s;ame Time that I treat &s;o reverable a Subject with all po&s;&s;ible De|licacy.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Ages of ACORNS, when all that &s;u&s;tained the &s;imple Nature of Man lay open and in common, like Light and Air; as People knew of nothing fur|ther that was to be had, they thought there was nothing further to be de&s;ired. As they had no Wi&s;hes they felt no Wants; and neither Pride, Envy, Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, or Debauchery could commence,
<PB N="161" REF="162">before they contrived the Di&s;tinctions of Property and Materials of Intemperance, and thereby contrived the Cau&s;es of Quar|rel and Corruption.</P>
<P>But, as <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays, <Q><HI>quum oppida caeperunt munire,</HI></Q> when they began to build, and &s;et out Land-Marks, to plow and to &s;ow, to &s;pin and to weave, to han|dle the File and Hammer; in Proportion to the Advancement of Invention and Arts, on Nece&s;&s;ity Convenience aro&s;e, upon Con|venience Elegance, upon Elegance Luxu|ry; new De&s;ires encrea&s;ed and multiplied with the Means of Gratification; real Wi&s;hes became the Offspring of imagina|ry Wants; as tho&s;e Wi&s;hes waxed warm the Pa&s;&s;ions were enkindled; and the Vices, la&s;tly, grew in mathematical Proportion to the Growth of the Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>All Hi&s;tories, as well profane as &s;acred, in every Age, in every Nation, and in every In&s;tance, bear unque&s;tionable Te&s;ti|mony to the above State of Facts. And hence en&s;ues the Nece&s;&s;ity of our growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till the Pinnacle of Art &s;hall put a Limit to De&s;ire, till Invention &s;hall be exhau&s;ted, and no longer prolific of new Wants and additional Wi&s;hes in Man.</P>

But, &s;o long as untried Allurements, &s;o long as unta&s;ted Plea&s;ures, &s;o long as new Objects can be &s;et up to our Imagination in our eager Pur&s;uit after Happine&s;s on Earth, our Wi&s;hes will enflame our Impa|tience to reach the Prize; in Proportion to that Impatience our Endeavours will be exerted; in Proportion to &s;uch Exertion the Fences of Law and Morals will be broke through or trampled down; and, in Proportion to the In&s;ufficiency of moral Re&s;traints, all Sorts of Fraud and Violence, of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Corruption, of De|bauchery and Profligacy mu&s;t prevail throughout the World.</P>

<P>Whenever you can make it evident, that to humble the Spirit of Man, you ought to place him in Authority; that, to
<PB N="163" REF="164">convince him of per&s;onal Defaults and In|firmities, you ought to enclo&s;e him with Sycophants and &s;ervile Dependents; that, to make him temperate, you &s;hould &s;eat him at the Table of a <HI>Lucullus;</HI> and that, to humanize his Di&s;po&s;ition, you &s;hould remove him as far as po&s;&s;ible from a Sen&s;e of the Mi&s;eries of his fellow Creatures; when, to cure a Man of Di&s;tempers inci|dent to his Nature, you would place him in the Mid&s;t of adventitious Contagion; then, and not till then, will Wealth, Stati|on, and Power be productive of Reforma|tion and Virtue in Man.</P>
<P>Your Error lay in &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;en&s;ual Appetite and &s;piritual Ambition would cea&s;e or abate on Gratification or Indul|gence. But this is not po&s;&s;ible. The Spirit of Man is a deathle&s;s De&s;ire; its Cravings cannot be &s;atiated till it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of &s;ome Object that is adequate to its Nature: and, as this World has no &s;uch Object to exhibit, Gratifications only &s;erve to provoke to further De&s;ire, or finally to &s;ink us into utter De&s;pondence. And this makes the Moral that was intended by the Philo&s;ophers, when they fabled that the Son of <HI>Philip</HI> broke into a Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears, on finding that no more Worlds remained for him to conquer.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
Your Pardon yet, I pray&mdash;With re&s;pect to your Opinion that the De&s;cen|dents, of the Mighty and the Exalted, in|herit the Qualities and Excellencies of their Progenitors, you &s;peak as though this Earth and all that was thereon were in|variably permanent; whereas the knowing-Ones will tell you that the one and the other are &s;ubject to annual, and even di|urnal Revolutions.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is not a Beggar or Slave, upon Earth, who&s;e &s;ometime Progenitor was not a Prince or an Emperor. Per|haps there is not a Prince or Emperor, upon Earth, who&s;e &s;ometime Progenitor was not a Slave or a Beggar. Have you then the Di&s;cernment to perceive in the Beggar the Lineaments of the Prince, or in the Prince to retrace the Lineaments of the Beggar? You have not, &s;age Sir. I will tell you a Story.</P>
<P>The Cardinal <HI>Campejius,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch great Cardinal, happen'd to have a Di&s;pute with the Duke of <HI>Modena.</HI> Altercation ro&s;e high. Do you know, &s;ays the Prince in Pa&s;&s;ion, that your Father was no better than my Father's Hog-Herd? I know it full well, coolly an&s;wered the Cardinal; and I am per&s;uaded that, had your High|ne&s;s been the Son of my Father, you would
<PB N="165" REF="166">have continued of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion to this Day.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a World as this, all Things are in perpetual Change, Rotation and Revo|lution. It is Nature's Proce&s;s. As the Summer and Winter gradually &s;ucceed and encroach upon Each-other; or, as the Sun dawns and ari&s;es from Darkne&s;s till he reaches the mid-day Fervour of his culmi|nating Beam, and thence declines till he &s;ets in utter Darkne&s;s; even &s;o mighty Na|tions, as well as Families, have their Com|mencement, A&s;cent and Summit, Declen&s;i|on, Decay and Period. The Vertue of all Nations and Families begins in Poverty, thence ari&s;es to Indu&s;try, Genius, Honour, perhaps to Conque&s;t and Empire, there's their Zenith. But then comes on the Load of ponderous Wealth that gradually weighs them down, from this Meridian, to Indulgence, Sen&s;uality, Guilt, Corrup|tion, Pro&s;titution, Slavery, Perdition.</P>
<P>Let us now, with the Eye of Philo&s;o|phy, con&s;ider two Men in the mo&s;t con|tra&s;ted State that this World can admit, &s;uppo&s;e a King and a Beggar. Here, the King is more highly fed and more gayly cloathed than the Beggar; but, if the&s;e are Advantages de&s;erving E&s;timation, we behold both this Luxury and Lu&s;tre &s;ur|pa&s;s'd by the Bee in the Garden, and the
<PB N="166" REF="167">Lily in the Valley. Further, whatever the native Qualities of the King or Beggar may be, independent of the &s;aid external or per&s;onal Di&s;tinctions; we may, howe|ver, be a&s;&s;ured that an Education in the Mid&s;t of Sen&s;uality and Deception, of the Exhibition of Temptations and Gratificati|on of Lu&s;ts, of Para&s;ites and Pandars, Obei&s;ance and Pro&s;tration, of corporal In|dulgence and mental Impo&s;ition, can be no very good Friend to the Virtues.</P>
<P>If we carry the Compari&s;on further than this, we find the Body of the King to be as frail, as obnoxious to Pains, Di&s;ea&s;e and Inclemencies, even as naked, poor and pe|ri&s;hable as that of the Beggar.</P>
<P>But, if we take the Eye of Faith, to &s;ee further than with that of Philo&s;ophy, we behold their Souls alike immortal, of equal Dignity and Extent. We &s;ee Crea|tures re&s;embling the Creator him&s;elf, breathed from his own Spirit, form'd in his own Image, and ordained to his own Beatitude and Eternity. Here, all other Di&s;tinctions fall away and lo&s;e their Re|&s;pect, as an In&s;tant would do in Compari|&s;on of Ages, or a Molehill in Compari&s;on of yon boundle&s;s Expan&s;e. And here, we find a Beggar whom the King, him&s;elf, is bound to reverence, as being the unque&s;|tioned Heir of a KING, in Compari&s;ion of
<PB N="167" REF="168">whom all other Kings are but as Beggars. How utterly vile and contemptible is all Dignity and Dominion to &s;uch and Heir|&s;hip as this! an Heir&s;hip hourly approach|ing, perhaps ju&s;t at Hand; when the mag|nificent Ruin of Man &s;hall be rebuilt, when his Weakne&s;s &s;hall put on Power, his Corruption put on Glory, and his Mor|tal be wholly &s;wallowed up of Immortality!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Time after this, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> privately took <HI>Ned</HI> into his Clo&s;et, and calling him a good Boy, and giving him a few Shillings to buy Play-Things, de&s;ired him to give the be&s;t Hi&s;tory he could re|member, of him&s;elf and his Adventures, before he met with <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, &s;ays <HI>Ned,</HI> the fir&s;t Thing that I re|member of my&s;elf, is my going from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e a begging with my Mam|my. I dreamed indeed that I was once in a fine Hou&s;e, and among fine People, but I don't know where nor when, and &s;o I believe, as I &s;ay, it was only a Dream.</P>
<P>Do you remember your Daddy, <HI>Ned?</HI> no, Sir, I never had a Daddy, that I know of. My Mammy was very cro&s;s to me, and u&s;ed to take from me all the Money and Victuals that I begged; and that was a great deal, for I never let People re&s;t till they gave me &s;omething. And &s;o Sir, as I was &s;aying, my Mammy was very cro&s;s to me, and u&s;ed to half &s;tarve me, and gave me a Beating for every Hour in the Day.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170">
Did &s;he teach you your Prayers, <HI>Ned?</HI> no Sir, I believe &s;he had no Prayers to teach me; for &s;he u&s;ed to &s;wear and &s;cold &s;adly. And &s;o, Sir, as I was telling you, we begged from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, &s;ome|times in a Town, and &s;ometimes in the Country; till the Day &s;he run away from me.</P>
<P>How came your Mammy to run away from you, <HI>Ned?</HI> why Sir, we were beg|ging in your Town, and had got &s;ome Halfpence and filled our Bag, when my Mammy took up a Child at the Town's End, and run with it till &s;he got into the next Fields. The Child, Sir, cried &s;adly, and my Mammy went &s;o fa&s;t that I could not keep up with her, do my be&s;t. And &s;o, we heard a Man &s;houting behind us, and my Mammy turned and &s;aw him run|ning after her very fa&s;t; and &s;o &s;he threw down the Child and her great Bag on the Ground, and made the be&s;t of her way to the next Hedge, and got through it, Sir, and &s;o I never &s;aw any more of her.</P>
<P>What became of the Child, <HI>Neddy?</HI> when the Man, Sir, came up, he lifted it off the Ground, and he ki&s;&s;ed it a great many times, and made it quiet; and I'm thinking he was &s;o glad to &s;ee it, he took no Notice of me; how&s;omever, he took up
<PB N="170" REF="171">my Mammy's great Bag, and turned back and went the way he came. Then, Sir, I fell a crying and roaring terribly, to be left all alone, and to have Nobody in the World who would have any Thing to &s;ay to me; and I wi&s;hed for my Mammy a|gain, bad as &s;he was to me. And I &s;trove to follow her thro' the Hedge but wasn't able. And &s;o, I &s;aw a great Hou&s;e on one Side; and I was very &s;ad when I went to it; and there it was that I met my own young Ma&s;ter; and he put Cloaths upon me with his own dear Hands; and he took me to him&s;elf; and he is ever &s;ince &s;o kind to me, that it troubles me very much; for I can do nothing at all for him, you know, Sir, and that grieves me more than all the World.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Neddy,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> don't cry my Child. Be a good Boy, and mind your Book, and be &s;ure you tell no Lies, nor do Mi&s;chief to any Body; and I will take Care of you, and be a Father to you my|&s;elf. But tell me, <HI>Ned,</HI> would you know the Woman you call your Mammy, if you &s;hould &s;ee her again? yes, yes, Sir, cried <HI>Ned.</HI> There wasn't a Day of my Life but &s;he gave me Rea&s;on to remember her; I &s;hould know her from all the World, if I wasn't to &s;ee the Face of her for a hundred Years to come.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">
I find, <HI>Ned,</HI> you are not over fond of your Mammy. No indeed, Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Ned,</HI> I love Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI>'s little Finger, and I would love your&s;elf if I dare, Sir, better than a thou&s;and &s;uch Mammies as mine was; and that I &s;uppo&s;e is very naughty; for all good Children, they &s;ay, love their Fathers and Mothers. Well <HI>Ned,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> if you happen at any Time to &s;ee her, among the great Number of Beggars that come to our Door; don't you &s;peak to her, or &s;hew that you take the lea&s;t Notice of her; but come and tell me, or hone&s;t <HI>James</HI> in my Ab&s;ence, that we may take Care of her, and force her to confe&s;s whether &s;he is, in reality, your Mother or not.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> was &s;peaking, <HI>An|drew</HI> entered with Tidings that a Chariot was overturned, not twenty Yards from the Door, and that he feared the People in it were much hurt. Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI>'s Humanity was much alarmed at the News; he or|dered the Servants to follow him, and in|&s;tantly hurried out to give all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he could to the Strangers.</P>
<P>The Chariot happened to be overturn|ed, by the &s;lipping out of one of the Linchpins that kept the Wheel on the Axletree. The Company had already got
<PB N="172" REF="173">out. They were an agreeable young Cou|ple, Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI> and his Wife, who had come from <HI>London</HI> on purpo&s;e to take an Airing on the Hill. Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> had &s;uf|fered nothing, except from her Fears; but Mr. <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Right Arm was &s;omething brui&s;ed, by his endeavouring to pre&s;erve his Lady in the Fall.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> appeared the greate&s;t Suffer|er of the three, and addre&s;&s;ed the Strangers with a Countenance that convinced them how feelingly he was intere&s;ted in their Safety. He left <HI>Andrew</HI> to have the Cha|riot &s;et to Rights; and, having conducted his new Gue&s;ts to his own Hou&s;e, he or|dered up a Bottle of Sack and &s;ome Naple Cakes to the Parlour.</P>
<P>When they were all &s;eated, and the Gla&s;s had gone round; I find, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> that People are apt to be di&s;|gu&s;ted with what they call Accidents, and which may afterward turn out to their greate&s;t Advantage. Perhaps I &s;hould never have known what true Humanity was, if our Carriage had not been over|turned this Day. If you knew all, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> with a tender Bluntne&s;s, you would be far from laying any Humanity at my Door, &s;ince I rejoice at an Accident, where the Damage is all yours, and the
<PB N="173" REF="174">Advantage that ari&s;es from it is all my own.</P>
<P>I'd hold Fifty to one, cried Mrs. <HI>Field|ing,</HI> that this is the very Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> we have heard &s;o much about. Indeed Ma|dam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> you &s;urprize me much; if I had the Plea&s;ure of ever know|ing you, there is &s;omething in that Face I &s;hould not have readily forgot.</P>
<P>No, Sir, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> I &s;peak from Information. I never had the Hap|pine&s;s of being known to you, till now. We have a Fo&s;terer in this Village, <HI>Ro&s;e Jenkins,</HI> a poor Widow, one of tho&s;e many Per&s;ons you have down on your Li&s;t. She was Nur&s;e to our only Child, while he lived and was with us, &s;he was a con&s;tant Vi&s;itant; but, as &s;oon, as &s;oon as&mdash;Here Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> he&s;itated, her Lip trem|bled, and her Eye gli&s;tened with a filling Tear&mdash;I &s;ay, Sir, as &s;oon as a very &s;ad Affair happened; the poor Woman came near us no more. One Day, as we were taking the Air through this Town, I thought I &s;aw a Face that was familiar to me. I called to the Coachman to &s;top. It was my old Nur&s;e. She had a Family of &s;mall Children, and had fallen &s;adly to Decay before you came, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> to &s;ettle in the Town. I chid her for becom|ing a Stranger to us. Ah, Madam, &s;aid
<PB N="174" REF="175">the kind Creature, the Tears bur&s;ting from her Eyes, how could I go near a Place where every Thing would put me in mind of my dear lo&s;t Child&mdash;&s;he &s;till continued to weep&mdash;and I&mdash;wept for Company&mdash;I put a Guinea in her Hand, and in&s;i&s;ted on her coming to &s;ee us. She did &s;o. It was then, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that we learned your Name and Character. And you mu&s;t ex|pect the Mortification, now and then, of hearing a little of tho&s;e many Things that are &s;poken to your Advantage. I am &s;or|ry, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that my No|things &s;hould be talked of; le&s;t it &s;hould intimate that other People are le&s;s o&s;tenta|tious.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> was &s;till affected by what &s;he had been &s;aying. And, though Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> wi&s;hed to know what the &s;ad Affair was at which &s;he had hinted, he declined a&s;king any Que&s;tions, for fear of renewing her Affliction.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> had walked a|broad, upon a Vi&s;it, with their Pupil <HI>Har|ry.</HI> So that Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and his Friend <HI>Ned,</HI> with Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> made the whole of the pre&s;ent Company.</P>
<P>You are happily &s;ituated, Sir, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fielding.</HI> I blame my&s;elf and all others, who have any Independence, and yet live
<PB N="175" REF="176">in a City. Health, Plea&s;ure, and Spirits are all for the Country. Did any Poets or Philo&s;ophers ever place their golden Aeras, or golden Scenes, amid&s;t &s;uch a Town as <HI>London?</HI> a Man can &s;carce be him&s;elf, he is confu&s;ed and di&s;&s;ipated by the Variety of Objects and Bu&s;tle that &s;ur|rounds him. In &s;hort, Sir, I am like many others, the rever&s;e in Per&s;ua&s;ion of what I am in Practice, I live in a City, although I dete&s;t it. It is true that I am fond of Society and Neighbourhood, but Experience has &s;hewn me that <HI>London</HI> is not the Place in which I can enjoy it.</P>
<P>No Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> if I was a Lover of Solitude, if I wi&s;hed to be the mo&s;t reclu&s;e of all Anchorites that bid adieu to the Commerce of Mankind, I would chu&s;e <HI>London</HI> for my Cell. It is in &s;uch a City alone, that a Man may keep wholly un|known and unnoticed. He is there, as a Hail&s;tone amid&s;t a great Shower, he jumps and bu&s;tles about awhile, then lies &s;nug among his Fellows, without being any more ob&s;erved than if he were not upon Earth, till he melts away and vani&s;hes with the re&s;t of his Fraternity.</P>
<P>I am not for a Cell, Sir, replied Mr. <HI>Fielding.</HI> I love Society, but yet a Society that is founded in Friend&s;hip; and People, in great Cities, are &s;o divided and di&s;&s;ipat|ed
<PB N="176" REF="177">by the Multitude of &s;olliciting Objects and Acquaintance, that they are rendered incapable of a particular Attachment. I imagine, however, that in a well peopled and civilized Part of the Country, a Man might make an Election of Per&s;ons de|&s;erving his E&s;teem, &s;uch as he would wi&s;h to live with in a happy Interchange of kind Offices and Affections. This indeed is my Plan for my Remainder of Life; but the Law&s;uits, in which I am at pre&s;ent involved, will not permit me to go in &s;earch of my <HI>Utopia.</HI></P>
<P>At Law! exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> then Sir, you are much to be blamed, or much to be pitied.</P>
<P>I hope, rather to be pitied than blamed, rejoined Mr. <HI>Fielding.</HI> Four Suits de&s;cend|ed to me on the Part of my own Father, and three on the Part of the Father of my Wife; and my Adver&s;aries, on all Sides, are &s;uch Cocks of the Game, that no O|vertures can induce them to li&s;ten to any Terms of Compromi&s;e or Accommoda|tion.</P>
<P>If Matters of Wealth or Property, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> are really Matters of valuable E&s;timation in Life, it is much to be la|mented that there is no Place, on Earth,
<PB N="177" REF="178">wherein Property can be &s;aid to be fixed or a&s;certained. Throughout the Regions of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> De&s;poti&s;m, Life and Property are, alike, Tenures at the Will of the Ruler. Again, throughout the <HI>European</HI> Continent, no Man, indeed, no Nation can be a&s;&s;ured of their Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, expo&s;ed as they are to the Ambition and Avarice of their almo&s;t perpetually in|vading Neighbours. La&s;tly in the&s;e Nor|thern I&s;lands, who&s;e Defence Nature her|&s;elf appears to have undertaken, by a Guardian&s;hip of circling Rocks and Seas; this does not however defend us from in|te&s;tine Convul&s;ions and Changes. Think, what a general Change of Property has been made, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> during the two very late Revolutions; I am told that, in a neighbouring Country, the Alienation has been nearly univer&s;al; perhaps a third Revolution is al&s;o at Hand.</P>
<P>It is affirmed that the civil Con&s;titution of <HI>England</HI> is the be&s;t calculated for the Security of Liberty and Property, of any that was ever framed by the Policy of Man; and originally, perhaps, it might have been &s;o; when twelve &s;imple and im|partial Men were appointed for the &s;peedy Trial and Determination of Life and Pro|perty.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
Our Ance&s;tors, unque&s;tionably, were at that Time unble&s;s'd by the liberal and learned Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Long-Robe;</HI> they would not otherwi&s;e have committed the Di&s;po&s;ition of Property (a Matter held &s;o much more valuable than that of Life) to a few Men, who could have no <HI>Virtue</HI> under Heaven to recommend them, &s;ave the two illiterate Qualities of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Common Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e were Ages of mental Darkne&s;s and no Way illumin'd, as we are, by tho&s;e immen&s;e and immaculate Volumes of refined and <HI>legal Metaphy&s;ics,</HI> that now pre&s;s the Shelves of the Learned, and are read with &s;uch Delight. A Man, in tho&s;e Times, had no Play for his Money; he was either &s;tript or enrich'd of a &s;udden; whereas now, in the wor&s;t Cau&s;e, Hope is left during Life; and Hope is &s;aid to be the greate&s;t Cordial in this Vale of <HI>human Controver&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>It is greatly to be lamented that the learned, in our Laws, are not as immortal as the Suits for which they are retained. It were therefore to be wi&s;hed that an Act of Parliament might be e&s;pecially pa&s;&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e; a Matter no way im|practicable, con&s;idering the great Intere&s;t tho&s;e Gentlemen have in the Hou&s;e. In
<PB N="179" REF="180">Truth it &s;eems highly expedient, that an Infinity of Years &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to each Student of the <HI>Belles Lettres</HI> of our Laws, to enable them to read over that Infinity of Volumes which have already been pub|li&s;hed; to &s;ay nothing of the Infinity that are yet to come, which will be held equally Nece&s;&s;ary for under&s;tanding the Profe&s;&s;ion, of critically di&s;tingui&s;hing, and oratorically expatiating on Law again&s;t Law, Ca&s;e again&s;t Ca&s;e, Authority again&s;t Au|thority, Precedent again&s;t Precedent, Sta|tute again&s;t Statute, and Argument again&s;t Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In Matters of no greater Moment than Life and Death, Juries, as at the Begin|ning, are &s;till permitted to enter directly on the Hearing and Deci&s;ion. But, in Matters &s;o &s;acred as that of Property, our Courts are extremely cautious of <HI>too early</HI> an Error in Judgment. In order therefore to &s;ift and boult them to the very Bran, they are delivered over to the Lawyers, who are, equally, the Affirmers and Di&s;|puters, the Pleaders and Impleaders, Re|pre&s;enters and Mi&s;repre&s;enters, Explainers and Confounders of our Laws. Our Law|yers, therefore, maintain their Right of being paid for their Ingenuity in putting and holding all Properties in Debate. De|bated Properties, con&s;equently, become the Properties of the Lawyers, as long as An|&s;wers
<PB N="180" REF="181">can be given to Bills, or Replies to An&s;wers, or Rejoinders to Replies, or Re|butters to Rejoinders; as long as the Bat|tledors can &s;trike and bandy, and till the Shuttle-cock falls of it&s;elf to the Ground.</P>
<P>Soberly and &s;eriou&s;ly &s;peaking, <HI>Engli&s;h Property,</HI> when once debated, is merely a <HI>Carca&s;s of Contention</HI> upon which interpo|&s;ing Lawyers fall, as cu&s;tomary Prize and Prey during the Combat of the Claimants. While any Fle&s;h remains on a Bone, it continues a Bone of Contention. But, &s;o &s;oon as the learned Practitioners have pick'd it quite clean; the Battle is over, and all again is Peace and &s;ettled Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It is worthy of much Plea&s;antry and &s;haking of Sides to ob&s;erve that, in intri|cate, knotty, and extremely perplexing Ca&s;es, where the Sages of the Gown and Coif are &s;o puzzled as not to know what to make of the Matter; they then be|queath it to the Arbitration and Award of two or three plain Men; or by Record, to the Judgment of twelve &s;imply hone&s;t Fel|lows who, ca&s;ting a&s;ide all Regard to the Form of Writs and Declarations, to the Lap&s;e of Mono&s;yllables, verbal Mi&s;takes and Mi&s;nomers, enter at once upon the Pith and Marrow of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in three Hours determine, according to Equity and Truth, what had been &s;u&s;pending in the
<PB N="181" REF="182">dubious Scales of Ratiocination, Quotation, Altercation, and pecuniary Con&s;ideration, for three and twenty Years.</P>
<P>Neither do I &s;ee any Period to the Pro|gre&s;s of this Evil; the Avenue &s;till opens and leads on to further Mi&s;chiefs. For the Di&s;tinctions in Law are, like the New|tonian Particles of Matter, <HI>divi&s;ible ad in|finitum.</HI> They have been dividing and &s;ub|dividing for &s;ome Centuries pa&s;t, and the Subdivi&s;ions are as likely to be &s;ubdividing for ever; in&s;omuch that Law, thus divi&s;i|ble, debateable, and delayable, is become a greater Grievance than all that it was in|tended to redre&s;s.</P>
<P>I lately a&s;ked a plea&s;ant Gentleman of the Coif, if he thought it po&s;&s;ible for a poor Man to obtain a Decree, in Matter of Property, again&s;t a rich Man? he &s;miled and an&s;wered, according to Scripture, that <HI>with Man it was impo&s;&s;ible, but that all Things were po&s;&s;ible to God.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he meant, that the Decrees of the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> were hereafter to be rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>Perhaps Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> neither our Laws nor our Lawyers are &s;o much to blame as the People who apply to them for Protection, for Ju&s;tice, Satisfaction, or Revenge. Might not the Parties, who ad|venture on the Cour&s;e of Litigation, begin
<PB N="182" REF="183">where they are mo&s;t likely to end their Career, in the Award of a few Per&s;ons, or a Verdict of twelve Neighbours?</P>
<P>But the Nature of Man is prone to Con|tention and Quarrel. There is a certain Portion of Ye&s;t or Fermentation in his Ma&s;s that will have Vent in &s;ome Way, and our Courts of Law are the mo&s;t ob|vious Receptacles for the Ebullitions of Pride, Avarice, Envy, Re&s;entment, and Wrathfulne&s;s, the In&s;olences of Temper, and Overflowings of Fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Scruple,</HI> an Attorney, a very &s;ingu|lar Man in his Way, was lately recom|mended to me, as a Per&s;on equally quali|fied for alluring or compelling my litigating Opponents to an Accommodation. And he told me an exceeding plea&s;ant Story, as well re&s;pecting the Proce&s;s and Forms of our Courts of Law, as re&s;pecting the contentious Di&s;po&s;ition of our Neighbours.</P>
<P>Some Time &s;ince, <HI>Walter Warmhou&s;e,</HI> a &s;ub&s;tantial Farmer in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> was advi&s;ed, by Serjeant <HI>Craw,</HI> that he had an unque&s;|tionable right to a certain Tenement in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Barnaby Bonniface,</HI> his next Neighbour and Go&s;&s;ip, who fattened by the dint of good Ale and good Hu|mour.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184">
<HI>Barnaby,</HI> who equally hated Debate and dry Bowels, offered to leave the Matter, in que&s;tion, to any hone&s;t Neighbours of <HI>Walter</HI>'s own chu&s;ing; but <HI>Walter,</HI> proud of a weighty Opinion and as weighty a Pur&s;e, rejected the proffered Compromi&s;e with Scorn, and took a mortal Aver&s;ion to hone&s;t <HI>Barnaby</HI> becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;urrender his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on demand.</P>
<P><HI>Walter Warmhou&s;e</HI> accordingly began the Attack, in Form. But Mr. <HI>Scruple,</HI> who had the uncommon Con&s;cience to re|member that <HI>Barnaby</HI> had once recovered his Pur&s;e from a Highway-Man, deter|mined as far as po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve the Property of his old Friend. For this Pur|po&s;e he kept warily and cheaply on the defen&s;ive; and, while he held a watchful Eye over the Motions of the Adver&s;ary, he followed him clo&s;e through a thirteen Years Labyrinth of Law-Forms; and, what with Exceptions to Bills and Replies, expen&s;ive Commi&s;&s;ions for Examination of Witne&s;&s;es, Demurrer, Imparlance and E&s;|&s;oign; with Hearings, and Rehearings, Defer of I&s;&s;ue thereon, Co&s;ts of Suit and Co&s;ts of Office; he pretty nearly ex|hau&s;ted both the Pur&s;e and the Patience of the valorous Plaintiff <HI>Walter Warmhou&s;e.</HI> Whereupon his prudent Patron, the good Serjeant <HI>Craw,</HI> deemed it high time to
<PB N="184" REF="185">con&s;ent to a Motion for referring the Ca&s;e to the Arbitration and Award of certain Umpires, though not of his Client's choo&s;|ing, as at fir&s;t propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Soon after this Order, Serjeant <HI>Craw</HI> had occa&s;ion to travel to the farther Parts of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and his Road led to the Concerns of his old Client <HI>Walter Warmhou&s;e.</HI> Here, <HI>Walter</HI> happened to meet him, and warn|ed him of the manifold <HI>Dangers of the Way,</HI> and of <HI>the Numbers of Thieves and Highway|men that infe&s;ted the Pa&s;&s;ages that lay ju&s;t be|fore him.</HI> And pray then, very &s;moothly &s;ays the Serjeant, is there no way through your Fields Mr. <HI>Warmhou&s;e?</HI> there is, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Warmhou&s;e,</HI> as good as any in <HI>England.</HI> And may I not be permitted to pa&s;s? Mo&s;t &s;afely, and a thou&s;and welcomes.</P>
<P>Hereupon, Client <HI>Warmhou&s;e</HI> opened the Gate that led from the Road into the Fields, and in i&s;&s;ued the Equipage of his learned Advocate and kind Patron.</P>
<P>Goodman <HI>Warmhou&s;e</HI> was mounted on a round ambling Nag, and rode much at his Ea&s;e by the Chariot of his <HI>Malefactor.</HI> They chatted, as they went, about the Prices of Cattle and Improvement of Lands, the Fall and Ri&s;e of Grain, the Nece&s;&s;ity of Indu&s;try; and above all, of the Advantage of good Enclo&s;ures, which,

<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
A certain Judge of a Court of Law, in that Kingdom, had grown aged on the Bench, and honoured by the innumerable Sentences which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and which were all deemed conformable to the mo&s;t perfect Mea&s;ure and Di&s;pen&s;ation of Equi|ty. The Gainers of the &s;everal Suits ap|plauded his Di&s;cernment and Ju&s;tice to the Skies; and even the Lo&s;ers allowed that they had no right to complain. The Fame of his Wi&s;dom and Integrity reach|ed the Throne; the Monarch was curious to &s;ee a Judge of &s;o peculiar a Ca&s;t and Character; and he &s;ent for him under Co|lour of thanking him for the great Ho|nours which he had done to his Regency.</P>
<P>After a mo&s;t gracious Reception, and &s;ome Compliments at the Levee, the Prince took him apart and in Confidence &s;aid.</P>
<P>"My Lord Judge, the infinite Com|plaints that come before me from all Parts of the Kingdom, re&s;pecting the erroneous or iniquitous Sentences daily pa&s;&s;ed by your Fraternity, ca&s;t the highe&s;t Lu&s;tre on the Singularity of your Conduct, and give me an eager Curio&s;ity to know by what Mea|&s;ures you have been enabled to content all Parties. I adjure you then, by all that you reverence, to di&s;gui&s;e nothing from
<PB N="187" REF="188">me on this Head. You have not any thing to fear from my Cen&s;ure of Means that have proved &s;o very &s;ucce&s;sful, and you have all things to hope from my Appro|bation."</P>
<P>The Judge, thereupon, ca&s;t him&s;elf at the Feet of his Prince and, ri&s;ing, addre&s;&s;ed him thus.</P>
<P>To you, my Sovereign, as to Heaven, I will open my whole Soul.&mdash;In the fir&s;t Place, in order to enable my&s;elf to give a Gue&s;s whether the Judgments, to be pro|nounced, might be right or wrong, I gave all po&s;&s;ible Attention to the Merits of each Ca&s;e during the Proce&s;s; I daily took Mi|nutes of the Pleadings on either Side; I enlarged and commented on tho&s;e Minutes while Matters were fre&s;h in my Memory; and I never interrupted any Cau&s;e, till it had run it&s;elf out of Breath through the Circuit of Forms and due Cour&s;e of Law.</P>
<P>In the next Place, may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I never took Bribe or Pre&s;ent of any Kind, or from any Hand; le&s;t Favour or Inclination &s;hould in&s;en&s;ibly tempt me to <HI>cogg,</HI> or give <HI>a partial Turn to the final Ca&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Thus prepared, as &s;oon as Matters were ripe for a Decree; that is to &s;ay, as &s;oon
<PB N="188" REF="189">as the re&s;pective Lawyers had agreed a|mong them&s;elves, that <HI>nothing more was to be &s;aid,</HI> nor any Thing <HI>more to be got,</HI> on either Side of the Que&s;tion; I &s;ummed up the repugnant Merits &s;o equally and im|partially, with re&s;pect to Circum&s;tance, Evidence, and Ordinance of Law, as in|duced both Parties, now wearied and wi&s;h|ing for Re&s;t, to think that the Decree mu&s;t inevitably be given again&s;t them|&s;elves; and having appointed a certain Hour for uttering the fatal Sentence, I got up under vi&s;ible Concern, and retired.</P>
<P>From the Bench, &s;o plea&s;e your Graci|ou&s;ne&s;s, I withdrew to my Clo&s;et, and having locked my&s;elf up, I called upon my tutelary and never erring Directors in the &s;olution of all Knots and unwinding of all Intricacies; in &s;hort I went to a little Drawer and took out &mdash; <HI>my Box and Dice.</HI></P>
<P>Box and Dice! exclaimed the Monarch, Half &s;tarting from his Seat. Yes, Sire, re|plied the Judge, I repeat it, Box and Dice. And if your Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to at|tend, for a few Moments, I tru&s;t to con|vince you of the Propriety of this Pro|ceeding.</P>
<P><HI>Humanum e&s;t errare.</HI> This, my Liege, is a Maxim that has never yet been con|troverted
<PB N="189" REF="190">by Precept or by Practi&s;e; and it is as much as to &s;ay, that Life is a mere Labyrinth of Errors, in which all Men are appointed to travel, and to &s;tray.</P>
<P>Nothing, &s;ave Number and Mea&s;ure, is yet determined upon Earth. Nothing is certain, &s;ave that two and two make four, and that Lines are equal or differ accord|ing to their Dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>All Men, further than this, depend up|on <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as their Enlightner and Direc|tor in the Search of Truth. And yet Rea|&s;on, it&s;elf, has nothing whereon it may re&s;t or depend. It fir&s;t doubts, and then proceeds to examine. It calls in Evidence and Arguments, on this Side and on that Side, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> It compares, canva&s;&s;es, and di&s;cu&s;&s;es; &s;ifts and boults Matters, &s;uppo&s;e to the very Bran. It endeavours to poi&s;e the Scales of its own Uncertainty, and now recovers &s;ome lap&s;ed Circum|&s;tance, and ca&s;ts it into this Scale; and again throws &s;ome new Proof or Di&s;covery into that Scale; and &s;o changes its Opini|on from Day to Day.

<P><PB N="190" REF="191">
Truth, &s;o plea&s;e your Supremacy, has been &s;unk in &s;o very deep a Well, as to mock the five-inched Fathom of mere hu|man Ratiocination; whether it be a Dealer or Retailer of Phy&s;ic or Metaphy&s;ics; of the Di&s;tinctions in Law, or the Di&s;tincti|ons in Philo&s;ophy. And I flatter my&s;elf that I alone, the lea&s;t and mo&s;t unlikely of all your Maje&s;ty's Subjects, have hit upon a Method for fi&s;hing up Truth, by a Line which I acknowledge is not of my own twi&s;ting.</P>
<P>Within my Memory and, nearly, with|in that of your Maje&s;ty, particular Laws have been in Force for <HI>Trial by Combat,</HI> and <HI>Trial by Ordeal;</HI> and though, at pre|&s;ent, tho&s;e Laws are held to have been iniquitous and wholly ab&s;urd, they could not have been in&s;tituted without ju&s;t and ponderous Rea&s;ons. They related, my Liege, as my Sentences do, to the Inter|po&s;ition of Providence in the <HI>Jewi&s;h Lots;</HI> whereby all Doubts, however general, could be &s;peedily a&s;certained; where the Nation drew Lots according to Tribes, the Tribes according Families, and the Families by Individuals, till the Criminal was detected.</P>
<P>Thus, in Trial by Combat, I have known and read of manifold In&s;tances, wherein
<PB N="191" REF="192">guilty Courage and Prowe&s;s have been foiled by the Weak and Fearful. And, in Trial by Ordeal, Heaven never failed to guide the Steps of the hoodwinked In|nocent between the narrow Intervals of the burning Plow&s;hares. And thus, con&s;cious of my own Infirmity and Blindne&s;s, I have referred all my Decrees to a Power of bet|ter Di&s;cernment, and he never failed to determine according to Truth.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid the Monarch, I cannot wholly di&s;approve your Method, when I reflect on your Motive. And, according to your Account, when I think on the Plague and Anxiety, Lo&s;s of Time and Lo&s;s of Fortune, to which my Subjects are put by the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of the Law; you have clearly convinced me, my good Lord Judge, that it would be INFINITELY BETTER TO CAST DICE AT THE BEGINNING, THAN TO GIVE THE MOST RIGHTE|OUS JUDGMENT AT THE END OF ANY LAW-SUIT.</P>
<P>WHILE the Gentlemen were thus plung|ed in the bottomle&s;s Gulph of the Law, Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> beckoned <HI>Ned</HI> to a remote Part of the Room, and was greatly taken with his lively and innocent Chat.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, is this your Son? No Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> we
<PB N="192" REF="193">know not to whom he belongs, poor Fel|low; and I am per&s;uaded, from many Circum&s;tances, that he was &s;tolen, in his Infancy, from his true Parents.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> in&s;tantly coloured like Scarlet; and, ca&s;ting at her Hu&s;band an eager and animated Look, gracious Hea|ven! &s;he exclaimed, who knows, my Dear, but this may be our precious, our lo&s;t and long lamented Boy, to whom Providence this Day has &s;o wonderfully conducted us?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> it is thought that Hundreds of Children are yearly &s;pi|rited away from their Parents, by Gip&s;ies, by Beggars to excite Charity, and by Kid|nappers to carry to the Plantations; but I hear of very few that ever have been re|&s;tored, except in Romance. Pray, had you any particular Memorandum or Mark whereby you would know him to be your Child, on the Pre&s;umption of his being found?</P>
<P>Alas, no Sir, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Fielding;</HI> he was &s;carce two Year old when his Nur&s;e got Leave to go and &s;ee, a Relation, the only Vi&s;it, poor Woman that &s;he made from the Time &s;he took my Child to the Brea&s;t. She left him in the Care of the Hou&s;e Maid, who u&s;ed to care&s;s him with parti|cular
<PB N="193" REF="194">Tenderne&s;s. He &s;tood with her at the Door; &s;ome one called her in &s;uddenly; but, quickly returning, my Child was gone!</P>
<P>Ah! could the Wretches who took him have gue&s;&s;ed at the Heart-rending Angui&s;h which that Lo&s;s co&s;t me, it were not in the Nature of Barbarians, of Brutes, of Fiends them&s;elves to have imagined a Deed of &s;uch Deadline&s;s. For three Days and Nights, Life hover'd like a Flame that was ju&s;t departing, and was only retained by my frequent&punc; and long Swoonings that, for a Time, &s;hut up all Sen&s;e and Recollec|tion. Neither do I think that my dear Hu&s;band &s;uffered much le&s;s than my&s;elf, however he might con&s;train and exert his Spirits to keep up, as it were, &s;ome Ap|pearance of Manline&s;s.</P>
<P>We di&s;patched Cryers throughout the City, and through all the neighbouring Towns, with Offers of va&s;t Recompence to any who &s;hould di&s;cover and re&s;tore our Child to us; and we continued, for Years, to adverti&s;e him in all the public Papers. But alas, he mu&s;t have been taken by &s;ome very illiterate Wretches who could not read, and who never heard of the Re|wards that were offered, their own Intere&s;t mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have engaged them to re|turn
<PB N="194" REF="195">him. Pray, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> how did you come by this pretty Boy?</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Ned</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> to give a Detail, re&s;pecting him&s;elf, of the Circum|&s;tances already recited; and Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> mentioned the Precaution he had taken for &s;eizing his former Mammy, if ever &s;he &s;hould make her Appearance.</P>
<P>If Heaven &s;hould ever ble&s;s me with more Children, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fielding,</HI> I have determined to fix &s;ome indelible Mark upon them, &s;uch as that of the <HI>Jeru&s;alem-Let|ters,</HI> that, in ca&s;e of Accident, I may be able to di&s;cover and a&s;certain my own Offspring from all others. Such a Pre|caution, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> is more e&s;pecially incumbent on tho&s;e who &s;end their Chil|dren abroad to be nur&s;ed; where it is &s;o practicable for Fo&s;terers to impo&s;e a living Infant in the Place of one who has died; or, by an Exchange, to prefer a Child of their own to an Inheritance; for the Fea|tures of Infancy generally change to a Degree that &s;hortly leaves no Trace of the original Ca&s;t of Countenance; and it is common with Parents to leave their Chil|dren at Nur&s;e, for Years, without &s;eeing or renewing the Memory of their A&s;|pects.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">
Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Fielding,</HI> will you give me your Intere&s;t in this &s;weet Found|ling? I will regard him as my own Child, I will be good to him for the Sake of the one I have lo&s;t. Tell me, my Dear, will you come and live with me? &mdash; What &s;ay you <HI>Ned,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> would you like to go and live with that Lady? O Sir, cried <HI>Ned,</HI> could I find in my Heart to leave Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> and you, to be &s;ure I would give the World to be with this dear Lady. So &s;aying, he catch'd at her Hand and pre&s;&s;ed it eagerly to his Lips. Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> found her&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ed and agitated by this Action, and, taking him in her Arms, and repeatedly ki&s;&s;ing him, the Gu&s;h of Pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he had &s;ometime &s;uppre&s;&s;ed broke forth, and &s;he &s;hed a plenteous Shower of Tears upon him.</P>
<P>Word being now brought that the Cha|riot was put to Rights, and at the Door; Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Fielding</HI> took a tender Fare|wel of Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> and <HI>Ned,</HI> and &s;et off for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As we propo&s;e, after the Manner of the celebrated <HI>Vertot,</HI> to drop all the heavy and inanimate Parts of our Hi&s;tory, and to retain nothing but the Life and Spirit thereof; we take the Liberty to pa&s;s over a few Months, during which nothing ma|terial
<PB N="196" REF="197">happened, &s;ave that our <HI>Harry</HI> en|crea&s;ed in Stature, and in all per&s;onal and mental Accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It was the latter End of Augu&s;t, the Weather fair and plea&s;ant, when <HI>Harry</HI> i&s;&s;ued forth to his little <HI>Campus martius,</HI> accompanied by <HI>Neddy</HI> and the faithful <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>He was there met by his cu&s;tomary Companions in Arms, and they had nearly &s;ettled their Cour&s;es and Exerci&s;es for the Evening, when a young Phoenomenon of Nobility made his Appearance, like a Phoenix among the vulgar Birds, attended by two Servants in flaming Liveries.</P>
<P>All the Boys, except <HI>Harry,</HI> and <HI>Ned</HI> who kept clo&s;e to him, immediately ap|proached the glittering Stranger and paid their Re&s;pects with Admiration and a kind of awkard Obei&s;ance; while <HI>Harry</HI> eyed him a&s;kance, with a half &s;ullen and half di&s;dainful Regard, and, notwith&s;tand|ing the native Benevolence of his Temper, felt no kind of Complacence in his Bo&s;om toward him.</P>
<P>The young Nobleman, to make a pa|rade of his Wealth, and at the &s;ame Time to indulge his Petulance of Di&s;po&s;ition, took a Handful of Sixpences and Shillings
<PB N="197" REF="198">from his Pocket and, throwing them a|mong the Crew, cried, a Scramble Boys, a Scramble!</P>
<P>Hereupon a Scuffle royal in&s;tantly en|&s;ued. All of them, &s;ave three, eagerly grappled at the Pieces that had fixed their Eye; while each at the &s;ame Time &s;eized and &s;truggled with his Fellow. Our He|ro, mean while, ob&s;erved all that pa&s;&s;ed with a di&s;tingu&s;hing Attention. But, as the Cau&s;e of Quarrel was quickly conveyed from Sight, nothing wor&s;e happened than a few Trips and Boxes, to which the Par|ties had been accu&s;tomed, and therefore did not re&s;ent; in&s;omuch that my Lord was wholly defeated of the benevolent In|tention of his Genero&s;ity, and looked upon him&s;elf as defrauded of his Coin.</P>
<P>To compen&s;ate this Di&s;appointment, and to make &s;urer, for the future, of his dear|ly beloved Mi&s;chief; he took a Crown-Piece from his Pocket, and holding it up to the full View of the A&s;&s;embly, he pro|claimed it as the Prize of Victory between any two, who &s;hould &s;tep forth on the Spot, and engage in a Boxing Match. At the Word an unknown Champion &s;prung forward, in&s;tantly &s;tripped, and challenged the Field.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">
This unknown had arrived but that very Morning, with his Parents who came to &s;ettle at the Village. He was by Nature a very valiant but very quarrel&s;ome Boy; he had con&s;equently been engaged in a Number of occa&s;ional Combats, wherein he had generally come off victorious; and this gave him as full an A&s;&s;urance of Con|que&s;t as though his Brow had already re|ceived the Wreath.</P>
<P>The Stranger in Bulk and Stature ex|ceeded the Field, and no one had yet of|fered him&s;elf an Antagoni&s;t; when <HI>Harry</HI> &s;tepping up, thus addre&s;&s;ed him in a gentle but admoni&s;hing Accent.</P>
<P>I find, Sir, you are a Stranger; you are therefore to be excu&s;ed for behaving a|mi&s;s, as you are yet unacquainted with the Laws of this Place. But I mu&s;t now be &s;o free to inform you that, whoever quarrels here or boxes for Money, mu&s;t afterwards take a Turn with me for no|thing. As well before as after, bri&s;kly re|plied the Adver&s;ary; but I &s;corn to take you at an Advantage, prepare your&s;elf and &s;trip! you mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;hew me, re|joined <HI>Harry,</HI> that you are worth &s;tripping for.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">
The unknown in&s;tantly fired at what he held to be a boa&s;tful In&s;ult, and, leaping forward, aimed a Punch at <HI>Harry</HI>'s Stomach, with all his Force. When <HI>Harry,</HI> nimbly catching the right Wri&s;t of his Adver&s;ary in his left Hand, and giving him, at the &s;ame In&s;tant, a &s;udden Trip with his right Foot, and a Stroke acro&s;s the Neck with his right Arm; the &s;trange Hero's Heels flew up, and his Shoulders and Head came with a Squelch to the Earth.</P>
<P>As this unfortunate Champion lay, a&s;|toni&s;hed, di&s;mayed, and wholly di&s;qualified by his Fall from further Contention; <HI>Harry</HI> generou&s;ly &s;tepped forward and offered to rai&s;e him. But, turning from him, he painfully and &s;lowly aro&s;e, and muttering &s;omething not intelligible, he walked away with a &s;ullen but much aba&s;ed Motion.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI>'s Companions, hereat, began to &s;et up a Cry of Triumph and Deri&s;ion after the vanqui&s;h'd. But <HI>Harry</HI> &s;uddenly &s;topped them and cried, for Shame, my Friends! he is a brave Boy and de&s;erves to be honoured, though a Stranger to our Ways; and I hope, in my Heart, that he mayn't be hurt, nor di&s;couraged from com|ing among us any more.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="201">
Our young Nobleman, mean while, had ob&s;erved all that pa&s;&s;ed, and con&s;idered our Hero with an envious and indignant At|tention; when <HI>Harry,</HI> calling to him the three Boys who had declined to partake of the Scramble for my Lord's Money; my good Boys, cries he aloud, you had the Honour to refu&s;e to Quarrel and Tear your Companions and Friends to Pieces, for the dirty Matter of a few Sixpences, and the fir&s;t Part of your Reward &s;hall be many Sixpences.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he put his Hand in his Pocket and, taking out three Crowns, made a Pre&s;ent of one to each. Then, feeling a &s;ecret Touch of &s;elf Approbation, he turned to my Lord's Servants and ad|dre&s;&s;ed them, in an Accent, and with an Action rather too highly elevated. Go, he cried, my Friends, take your young Ma&s;ter home to his Father and Mother; and tell them, from me, that, &s;ince they have already made him a LORD, I wi&s;h the next thing they do, would be to make him a GENTLEMAN!</P>
<P>What, you Scoundrel, cried my Lord, do you tell me, to my Face, that I am not a Gentleman? and, flying in&s;tantly at <HI>Harry,</HI> he gave him a &s;mart Stroke on the left Cheek. <HI>Harry</HI> had ju&s;t begun to re|collect
<PB N="201" REF="202">his Error. But, being again kindled to quick Re&s;entment, he half repre&s;&s;ed and half enforced a &s;udden Paunch which he reached at the No&s;e of his Lord&s;hip, who, giving a Scream, fell backward, and mea|&s;ured his Length on the Field.</P>
<P>The two Servants immediately &s;tooped to rai&s;e their bleeding Ma&s;ter; and one of them, highly exa&s;perated to &s;ee his Lord in that Condition, turned furiou&s;ly upon <HI>Harry</HI> in order to cha&s;ti&s;e him. But <HI>Jack Freeman,</HI> his fellow Servant, &s;trait caught him by the Arm, crying, hold <HI>Patrick,</HI> hold! remember <HI>fair Play</HI> and <HI>Old Eng|land!</HI></P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;uddenly &s;topped, catched at our Hero's Hand, pre&s;&s;ed it warmly to his Lips, and cried, O, my noble&s;t Child, how I envy the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;erve you! then turning, he took his Lord by the Hand, and &s;traight led him away from the Field of Battle.</P>

<P>Appropo', to your turning a Lord into a Gentleman. When your Hero gave that ju&s;t though over haughty Re|proof to the In&s;olence and Petulance of the gay Stranger, had he not a clear Con|ception of the Character of your true Gen|tleman?</P>

<P>That perhaps may be done, with better Effect to the Under&s;tanding as well as the Heart, by in&s;tancing and exemplify|ing, rather than defining.</P>

Some Time after the Battle of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y, Edward</HI> the Third of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> the more than Heir of his Father's Renown, pre&s;&s;ed <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> to indulge them with the Plea|&s;ure of his Company at <HI>London. John</HI> was de&s;irous of embracing the Invitation, and accordingly laid the Propo&s;al before his Parliament at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Parliament ob|jected that the Invitation had been made with an in&s;idious De&s;ign of &s;eizing his Per|&s;on, thereby to make the cheaper and ea&s;ier Acqui&s;ition of the Crown, to which <HI>Edward</HI> at that Time pretended. But <HI>John</HI> replied, with &s;ome Warmth, that he was confident his Brother <HI>Edward,</HI> and more e&s;pecially his young Cou&s;in, were too much of the GENTLEMAN to treat him in that Manner. He did not &s;ay too much of the King, of the Hero, or of the Saint, but too much of the GEN|TLEMAN to be guilty of any Ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Sequel verified this Opinion.

<P>As <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and the <HI>Critics</HI> derived their Rules, for Epic Poetry and the Sublime, from a Poem which <HI>Homer</HI> had written long before any Rules were formed, or Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Purpo&s;e. Thus, from the Demeanour and innate Principles of particular Gentlemen, Art has borrow|ed and in&s;tituted the many Modes of Be|haviour, which the World has adopted under the Title of Good-Manners.</P>
<P>One Quality of a Gentleman is that of Charity to the Poor; and this is delicately in&s;tanced in the Account which Don <HI>Quixote</HI> gives, to his fa&s;t Friend <HI>Sancho Pan&s;a,</HI> of the valorous but yet more pious Knight Errant Saint <HI>Martin.</HI></P>
<P>On a Day, &s;aid the Don, Saint <HI>Martin</HI> met a poor Man half naked, and taking his Cloak from his Shoulders, he divided and gave him the one Half. Now, tell me at what Time of the Year this hap|pened. Was I a Witne&s;s? quoth <HI>Sancho,</HI> how the Vengeance &s;hould I know in what
<PB N="205" REF="206">Year, or what Time of the Year it hap|pened? Had&s;t thou, <HI>Sancho,</HI> rejoined the Knight, any thing within thee of the Sen|timent of Saint <HI>Martin,</HI> thou mu&s;t a&s;&s;ured|ly have known that this happened in Win|ter; for had it been Summer, Saint <HI>Mar|tin</HI> would have given the whole Cloak.</P>
<P>Another Characteri&s;tic of the true Gen|tleman, is a Delicacy of Behaviour toward that Sex, whom Nature has entitled to the Protection, and con&s;equently entitled to the Tenderne&s;s of Man.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman-Errant, entering into a Wood on a Summer's Evening, found him&s;elf entangled among Nets of green Thread that, here and there, hung from Tree to Tree; and, conceiving it &s;ome Matter of purpo&s;ed Conjuration, pu&s;h|ed valorou&s;ly forward to break through the Enchantment. Hereupon &s;ome beau|tiful Shepherde&s;&s;es interpo&s;ed with a Cry, and be&s;ought him to &s;pare the Implements of their innocent Recreation. The Knight, &s;urpri&s;ed and charmed by the Vi&s;ion, re|plied.&mdash;Fair Creatures! my Province is to protect, not to injure; to &s;eek all Means of Service but never of Offence, more e&s;pecially to any of your Sex and apparent Excellencies. Your pretty Nets take up but a &s;mall Piece of favoured Ground; but, did they enclo&s;e the World,
<PB N="206" REF="207">I would &s;eek out new Worlds, whereby I might win a Pa&s;&s;age, rather than break them.</P>
<P>Two very lovely but &s;hamefaced Girls had a Cau&s;e, of &s;ome Con&s;equence, de|pending at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> that indi&s;pen&s;ably required their per&s;onal Appearance. They were Relations of Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph Jeckel,</HI> and, on this tremendous Occa&s;ion, reque&s;ted his Company and Countenance at the Court. Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> attended accordingly, and the Cau&s;e being opened, the Judge demanded whether he was to entitle tho&s;e Ladies by the Denomination of Spin&s;ters? No, my Lord, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> they are Lilies of the Valley, they toil not, neither do they &s;pin, yet you &s;ee that no Monarch, in all his Glory, was ever arrayed like one of the&s;e.</P>
<P>Another very peculiar Characteri&s;tic of a Gentleman, is, the giving Place, and yielding to all with whom he has to do.</P>
<P>Of this we have a &s;hining and affecting In&s;tance in <HI>Abraham,</HI> perhaps the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed Character that may be found in Hi&s;tory, whether &s;acred or profane.</P>
<P>A Contention had ari&s;en between the Herd&s;men of <HI>Abraham</HI> and the Herd&s;men of his Nephew <HI>Lot,</HI> re&s;pecting the Pro|priety
<PB N="207" REF="208">of the Pa&s;ture of the Lands wherein they dwelled, that could now &s;carce con|tain the Abundance of their Cattle. And tho&s;e Servants, as is univer&s;ally the Ca&s;e, had, re&s;pectively, endeavoured to kindle and enflame their Ma&s;ters with their own Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>When <HI>Abraham,</HI> in Con&s;equence of this, perceived that the Countenance of <HI>Lot</HI> be|gan to change toward him, he called, and generou&s;ly expo&s;tulated with him as fol|loweth.</P>
<P><HI>Let there be no Strife, I pray thee, be|tween me and thee, or between my Herd&s;men and thy Herd&s;men; for we be Brethren. If it be thy De&s;ire to &s;eparate thy&s;elf from me, is not the whole Land before thee? if thou wilt take the Left Hand, then will I go to the Right; or if thou depart to the Right Hand, then I will go to the Left.</HI></P>
<P>Another capital Quality of the true Gen|tleman is, that of feeling him&s;elf concern|ed and intere&s;ted in others. Never was there &s;o benevolent, &s;o affecting, &s;o pa|thetic a Piece of Oratory exhibited upon Earth, as that of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s pleading with God for averting the Judgments that then impended over <HI>Sodom.</HI> But, the Matter is already &s;o generally celebrated, that I am
<PB N="208" REF="209">con&s;trained to refer my Reader to the Pa&s;|&s;age at full; &s;ince the &s;malle&s;t Abridge|ment mu&s;t deduct from its Beauties, and that nothing can be added to the Excellen|cies thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Honour,</HI> again, is &s;aid, in Scripture, pe|culiarly to di&s;tingui&s;h the Character of a Gentleman; where it is written of <HI>Sechem,</HI> the Son of <HI>Hamor,</HI> that <HI>he was more ho|nourable than all the Hou&s;e of his Father.</HI></P>
<P>This young Prince, giving way to the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion, had di&s;honourably defloured <HI>Dinah</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Jacob.</HI> But his Affections and Soul claved to the Party whom he had injured. He &s;et no Limit to his Offers for repairing the Wrong. A&s;k me, he &s;aid to her Kindred, <HI>a&s;k me never &s;o much Dowry and Gift, and I will give according as ye &s;hall &s;ay unto me; but give me the Dam&s;el to Wife.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it may be inferred, that human Excellence, or human Amiablene&s;s, doth not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in a Freedom from Frailty, as in our Recovery from Lap&s;es, our Dete&s;tation of our own Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and our De&s;ire of atoning, by all po&s;&s;ible Means, the Injuries we have done and the Offences we have given. Herein therefore may con&s;i&s;t the very &s;ingular Di&s;tinction which the great Apo&s;|tle
<PB N="209" REF="210">makes, between his E&s;timation of a <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and of a <HI>Good</HI> Man. For a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>righteous Man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>one would grudge to die; but for a good Man one would even dare to die.</HI> Here, the <HI>ju&s;t Man</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to adhere &s;trictly to the Rule of Right or Equity, and to exact from others the &s;ame Mea&s;ure that he is &s;atisfied to mete; but the <HI>good Man,</HI> though occa&s;ionally he may fall &s;hort of Ju&s;tice, has, properly &s;peak|ing, no Mea&s;ure to his Benevolence, his general Propen&s;ity is to give more than the due. The <HI>ju&s;t Man</HI> condemns and is de&s;irous of puni&s;hing the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Line pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf; but the <HI>good Man,</HI> in the Sen&s;e of his own Falls and Failings, gives Latitude, Indulgence and Pardon to others; he judges, he con|demns no one, &s;ave him&s;elf. The <HI>ju&s;t Man</HI> is as a Stream that deviates not, to the Right or Left, from its appointed Channel, neither is &s;welled by the Flood of Pa&s;&s;ion above its Banks; but the Heart of the <HI>good Man,</HI> the Man of <HI>Honour,</HI> the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> is as a Lamp lighted by the Breath of GOD, and none, &s;ave GOD him&s;elf, can &s;et Limits to the Efflux or Irradiations thereof.</P>
<P>Again, the Gentleman never envies any &s;uperior Excellence, but grows, him&s;elf, more excellent, by being the Admirer, Promoter, and Lover thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
<HI>Saul</HI> &s;aid to his Son <HI>Jonathan,</HI> <Q>Thou Son of the perver&s;e rebellious Woman, do not I know that thou ha&s;t cho&s;en the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> to thine own Confu&s;ion?

<HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Thar&s;us</HI> had been a Man of Bi|gotry, Blood and Violence; making Ha|vock, and breathing out Threatenings and Slaughter, again&s;t all who were not of his own Sect and Per&s;ua&s;ion. But, when the Spirit of that INFANT, who laid him&s;elf in the Manger of human Fle&s;h, came up|on him; he acquired a new Heart and a new Nature; and he offered him&s;elf a willing Subject to all the Sufferings and Per&s;ecutions which he had brought upon others.</P>
<P><HI>Saul,</HI> from that Time, exemplified, in his own Per&s;on, all tho&s;e Qualities of the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> which he afterwards &s;pecifies in his celebrated De&s;cription of that <HI>Charity</HI> which, as he &s;ays, alone endureth for ever.</P>

<P>Here, with what an inimitable Elegance did this Man, in his own Per&s;on, at once &s;um up the Orator, the Saint, and the Gentleman!</P>
<P>From the&s;e In&s;tances, my Friend, you mu&s;t have &s;een that the Character or ra|ther Quality of a GENTLEMAN does not, in any Degree, depend on Fa&s;hion or Mode, on Station or Opinion; neither changes with Cu&s;toms, Climates or Ages.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER did <HI>Harry</HI> feel him&s;elf &s;o deeply mortified, &s;o deba&s;ed in his own Eyes, as when my Lord's Footman, in Terms and with an Action &s;o uncom|monly re&s;pectful, had &s;tooped and ki&s;&s;ed his Hand. His Heart, but ju&s;t before, had whi&s;pered to him, that the Manner, in which he had admoni&s;hed the young Nobleman, expre&s;&s;ed more of the Pride and In&s;olence of his own Temper, than any friendly Intention to reform the Faults of another; and he already began to &s;u&s;|pect that the Manner, in which he had di&s;pen&s;ed his own Bounty, &s;hewed the &s;ame O&s;tentation which he meant to reprove, and, with which he had been &s;o highly offended in his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;gu&s;ted with him&s;elf, and con|&s;equently with all about him, he turned away from his Companions, walked &s;ad and &s;ilent homeward; and, pa&s;&s;ing &s;oftly through the Hall, withdrew to his own Chamber.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> had followed <HI>Harry</HI> at &s;uch a Di&s;|tance as ju&s;t to keep him in Sight, and entering where his Ma&s;ter &s;at reading in the Parlour, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> enquired eagerly
<PB N="214" REF="215">after his Boy. <HI>James</HI> ca&s;t at his Ma&s;ter, a Look of much Solemnity, and, &s;haking his Head in Token of Concern, ah Sir, &s;aid he, I'm &s;orry to tell you that Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> To-day, was not altogether as good a Boy as I could have wi&s;hed. Indeed I ob&s;erve of late that, at Times, he is apt to be very &s;udden and pa&s;&s;ionate. I doubt, Sir, we &s;hall have woful Doings by and by; he has terribly abu&s;ed and battered the Son and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> one of the worthie&s;t Noblemen in all <HI>England.</HI> To be &s;ure we &s;hall have &s;ad Complaints a|gain&s;t him. I was pre&s;ent at all that pa&s;&s;ed; and truly Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> was very much in Fault.</P>
<P>You delight me, you tran&s;port me, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> my only Affliction was that he had no Faults. I want him to have Faults, <HI>James,</HI> I want him to have Faults, &s;uch Faults as may make him feel them. But tell me minutely, as particularly as you can, how this Affair happened. <HI>James</HI> then gave a &s;pecial Detail of what we have recited. Whereupon Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> exclaim|ed, O, my noble, my generous, my in|comparable Boy! where is he? let me &s;ee him, what is become of him?</P>
<P>Upon enquiry, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> reported that &s;he had &s;een him &s;tealing &s;oftly up Stairs. Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> then taking his Book in his
<PB N="215" REF="216">Hand, &s;tole up after his <HI>Harry,</HI> and, open|ing his Chamber Door with the lea&s;t Noi&s;e po&s;&s;ible, &s;aw him &s;eated, in a dejected At|titude, in a far Corner of the Room; and, looking attentively at him, perceived that he had been in Tears.</P>
<P>He thereupon took a Chair, and gently &s;eating him&s;elf be&s;ide him, what is the Matter my <HI>Harry,</HI> he &s;aid, what ails my Love? Don't a&s;k me, don't a&s;k me, Sir, cried <HI>Harry;</HI> I daren't tell you, indeed I dare not. You would love me no longer, you would hate me if I &s;hould tell you. Hate you, my Darling, cried Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that is quite impo&s;&s;ible, I can never hate you, my <HI>Harry.</HI> But come, be free with your Friend, tell me openly and hone&s;tly, for what do you think I &s;hould hate you? for my Faults, Sir, for my Faults. To be &s;ure there isn't in the World &s;o bad a Boy as my&s;elf; and, what is wor&s;e than all that, when I think and mean to do better than ever, &s;omething comes in the way, and &s;poils the Whole, and &s;o turns all the Good that is in me into nothing but Naughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry</HI> could contain no longer, but bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ionate Gu&s;h of Tears and Sobs; and, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> tenderly em|bracing him, and taking him on his Knee, and cla&s;ping him to his Bo&s;om, gave way
<PB N="216" REF="217">to the kindred Emotion that &s;welled in his own Brea&s;t, and mingled his joyful Tears with tho&s;e of his <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Pa&s;&s;ion of the&s;e two Friends had &s;ub&s;ided, <HI>Harry</HI> began to take new Courage from the Care&s;&s;es of his dear Dada, who, as he &s;en&s;ibly felt, would never hate or for&s;ake him, however he might condemn and dete&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Well then, Dada, &s;ays he, &s;ince you are &s;o very good, I will tru&s;t you with my Story, &s;o far as it has to &s;ay to the little that I can remember of my Faults in it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that I had no &s;ooner got into your Field that you gave me for our Plays, than a young Ma&s;ter came up to us, &s;o grandly dre&s;&s;ed and attended, and with &s;uch a &s;aucy Air that he &s;eemed to &s;ay, in his own Mind, all the&s;e are but Dirt in Compari&s;on of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>As I looked at him, he brought to my Mind the Story you once told me of <HI>Her|cules,</HI> who was poi&s;oned by his fine Coat. So I began to pity him, and, I believe, to de&s;pi&s;e him too; and that you know wasn't right; for you told me that, who|ever de&s;pi&s;es another grows wor&s;e than the one he de&s;pi&s;es, and falls below him while
<PB N="217" REF="218">he thinks to &s;et him&s;elf above him; but that didn't come into my Head at the Time.</P>
<P>And &s;o, Sir, to &s;hew us all that he didn't matter Money, or that he loved Mi&s;chief the better of the two, he took out a Handful of Silver and threw it among my Companions, to &s;et them by the Ears; and this provoked and began to make me very angry with him; and thus one Fault brought me into another after it, like Water my Chickens come clock.</P>
<P>But this didn't &s;atisfy my young Lord, for they call'd him Lord, but he mu&s;t take out a Crown, and offer it to any two of my Companions that would box for it. So a Stranger that was ju&s;t come offered to box any one in the Company for it, but I don't repent of my beating him, becau&s;e he was the Challenger.</P>
<P>But, the wor&s;t is yet to come, Dada. There was &s;ome of my Companions who refu&s;ed to join in the Scramble for the Money, and that plea&s;ed me very much; and &s;o to reward them I took out a Hand|ful of Money, and gave them a Crown a piece. But you know, I needn't have taken out more Money than I meant to give them, if it wasn't partly to &s;hew my Lord that I had as much Money as him|&s;elf;
<PB N="218" REF="219">and &s;o I got my&s;elf up to the Head and Ears in the very &s;ame Fault that I found with him.</P>
<P>Now comes the wor&s;t of all. For, growing proud and conceited, as if I had no one Fault in the World; and as if the like of me was only fit to reprove others and teach them their Duty; I de&s;ired the fine Ma&s;ter to get him&s;elf Home, and &s;ince he was a Lord to learn al&s;o to be a Gentleman. Upon that he gave me a Blow, which I de&s;erved very well; but I didn't matter his Blow a Phillip, if I hadn't thought it an Affront before my Companions. So my Pa&s;&s;ion begun to ri&s;e, and I gave him a half Stroke; but unluckily it hit him full in the No&s;e, and I'm afraid he's hurted very &s;adly.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all, Dada, I know well enough there will come &s;ad Complaints again&s;t me, and &s;o I &s;hall bring Trouble and Di&s;turbance upon you; and that's Grief upon Grief.</P>
<P>Don't fear for me, <HI>Harry,</HI> I &s;hall do well enough, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> But, <HI>Harry,</HI> you have not told me near as great News as you thought to do. I knew all along that you had a very naughty Boy within you; but I forbore to tell you &s;o, becau&s;e I rather wi&s;h'd you &s;hould make the Di&s;|covery
<PB N="219" REF="220">your&s;elf, and now, God be prai&s;ed, you have found out the Secret.</P>
<P>And what Good will it do me, Dada, to know that I am bad, when I don't know how to make my&s;elf better? for, To-day I thought and meant to be very good, and yet found my&s;elf in the End to be wor&s;e than ever. But, as you &s;ay, to be &s;ure I have been very bad, though I hardly knew any Thing of the Matter till now. I now remember how I had like to murder poor Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> with the Sword; and a hundred other Things, if I could bring them to Mind. What &s;hall I do then, Dada, what &s;hall I do to grow good?</P>
<P>I will tell you, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> And, as you have generou&s;ly en|tru&s;ted me with one Secret, that of having a very bad Boy within you; it is but fair that I &s;hould entru&s;t you with another Se|cret, which is that of having an exceeding good Boy within you.</P>
<P>What, two Boys in one, Dada, how can that be? it is even &s;o, my Darling, you your&s;elf told me as much. Did you not &s;ay that, this very Day, the one was &s;truggling and fighting within you again&s;t the other? that the one was proud, &s;corn|ful, o&s;tentatious, and revengeful; the o|ther
<PB N="220" REF="221">humble, gentle, generous, loving, and forgiving; and that when the bad Boy got the better, the good Boy took him to Ta&s;k, and reprimanded and &s;everely re|buked him, and made him cry bitterly?</P>
<P>What you &s;ay indeed, Dada, is &s;ome|thing very like it, only I can't think how one Boy can be two Boys. Do you re|member, <HI>Harry,</HI> what you read la&s;t Night in the old Te&s;tament, about <HI>Rebecka</HI> the Wife of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> when &s;he was with Child? yes, very well, Sir. As how &s;he was with Child of Twins, <HI>and the Children &s;truggled together within her; and &s;he &s;aid, if it be &s;o, why am I thus? And &s;he went to enquire of the Lord.</HI> Very right, my Love; and I now &s;ay to you what God then &s;aid to <HI>Rebecka.</HI> I do not mean that you have two Boys within you, of the bodily Bulk, Features, and Shape of your&s;elf; but that you have two <HI>different Spirits</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> within you which, like <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> have quite different and adver&s;e Natures, Inclinations, and De&s;ires; the one prompt|ing and hurrying you into all that is Evil, the other inviting and leading you into all that is Good. So you &s;ee, <HI>Harry,</HI> and you have felt that, like <HI>Rebecka,</HI> you have your own <HI>E&s;au</HI> and your own <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;trug|gling within your Bo&s;om. And the War between them &s;hall never cea&s;e, till the
<PB N="221" REF="222">one &s;hall have wholly conquered and &s;ub|jected the other.</P>
<P>To make this Matter plainer and clear|er to you, my Darling, I will tell you a pretty Story out of the Book that is in my Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> was a King and a great Conquer|or, but, in his private Capacity, a very virtuous Man. On a Day, &s;ome of his Captains, ju&s;t returned from an Expedition, informed him that they had brought him the greate&s;t Wonder in the World, a young Prince&s;s called <HI>Panthea,</HI> whom they had taken captive, and who&s;e Charms ex|ceeded all that could be imagined of Wo|man.</P>
<P><HI>Cyrus,</HI> as I told you, was virtuous. He was already married, and he dreaded running the Ri&s;que of being &s;educed from his Hone&s;ty by the dangerous Allurements of this enchanting Beauty. He therefore ob&s;tinately, though reluctantly, forbid her Approach; and denied him&s;elf the Plea|&s;ure he might have taken in beholding her.</P>
<P>His own Honour however, and the Re|&s;pect due to the Quality and Accompli&s;h|ments of the Lady, demanded all po&s;&s;ible Attention and Precaution in her Behalf.
<PB N="222" REF="223">For this Purpo&s;e he &s;ummoned his chief Captains and Favourites. He a&s;ked, which of them would adventure to take the Charge of this young Beauty; and he pro|mi&s;ed the highe&s;t Rewards to tho&s;e who &s;hould honourably di&s;charge their Tru&s;t, but threatened his deepe&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure to any who &s;hould betray it.</P>
<P>All of them &s;hrunk at the Apprehen&s;ion of taking upon them the per&s;onal Cu&s;tody and Care of a Beauty, whom their great and virtuous Monarch had not even dared to look upon; and no one had offered to undertake this perilous Commi&s;&s;ion, till a valiant and noble Youth, named <HI>Ara&s;pes,</HI> &s;tood forth.</P>
<P>From my Infancy, O <HI>Cyrus,</HI> &s;aid the graceful Adventurer, I have been educated in the School and brought up at the Feet of the divine <HI>Zoroa&s;ter.</HI> I am accu&s;tomed from my Childhood to combat, conquer, and &s;corn all &s;en&s;ual Seducers. I hold Vir|tue in mine Eye, as its only Object; my Heart e&s;teems and affects it as my only Good; the Nature thereof is become one with my Nature; and I do not remember the Time wherein I have been tempted to deviate from Rectitude, or &s;ink beneath the Calls of Honour. I cannot therefore but &s;mile at the Fear of my Companions. Their Courage at a Breach or in the Field
<PB N="223" REF="224">is unque&s;tionable. I have &s;een them face a thou&s;and Deaths; I have &s;een them ru&s;h into Dangers; and yet they dread the Sight of a &s;ingle and weakly Female. For me &s;he can have no Terrors, &s;ince I am out of the Power and Reach of her Allure|ments. I will undertake the Charge of this formidable Creature, at the Ri&s;que of my Honour, at the Ri&s;que of my Life, and more than all at the Ri&s;que of the Favour of <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cyrus</HI> had long loved the Per&s;on, and contemplated and admired the Virtues of this Youth. He, therefore, with Joy and Confidence, committed this precious De|po&s;ite to his Tru&s;t; in full A&s;&s;urance that the Per&s;on and Honour of <HI>Panthea</HI> could no where be &s;o &s;afe as in the Protection of <HI>Ara&s;pes.</HI></P>
<P>The young Hero had in Reality all the Virtues that he boa&s;ted. His Education under &s;o beloved and re&s;pectable a Ma&s;ter; his early and long Habit of oppo&s;ing and rejecting the &s;malle&s;t Incitement to Vice; and the Delights which he was accu&s;tom|ed to feel in the Sentiments and Practice of what his Judgment approved, had in a Manner &s;o wholly lulled his naughty Self to &s;leep, that he did not &s;o much as dream that he had an Enemy within him.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="225">
This, my <HI>Harry,</HI> was his heavy Mi&s;|fortune, and the &s;ad Occa&s;ion of his Fall. For, not knowing that his evil <HI>E&s;au</HI> was &s;till alive in his Bo&s;om; not knowing that he had any one to oppo&s;e or to &s;truggle with; he kept neither Watch nor Guard, and &s;o lay naked and open to the Mi&s;chief that came upon him, as I am going to tell you.</P>
<P>On his &s;eeing the Lady who was com|mitted to his Tru&s;t, he felt no Emotion nor Sentiment &s;ave that of Wonder, as in beholding the mo&s;t perfect of the Works of his Creator; and he took a Plea&s;ure in providing that &s;he &s;hould be treated and accommodated with all po&s;&s;ible Attention and Re&s;pect, as due to &s;o accompli&s;hed and pre-eminent a Being.</P>
<P>As the Nature of his Commi&s;&s;ion gave him frequent Occa&s;ions of being near and about the Per&s;on of his amiable Ward, new Beauties grew daily vi&s;ible and opened to his Eyes. But, abve all, in conver&s;ing with her, the Mu&s;ic of her Accents, and the Elegance of her Sentiments fell in&s;en&s;i|bly on his Soul that drank them up, as a dry Ground drinks up the invi&s;ible Dew of the Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="226">
His Occa&s;ions for attending her, and doing little Offices and Services about her, now daily encrea&s;ed without &s;eeming to do &s;o. When he was called and intended to go el&s;ewhere, his Feet imperceptibly car|ried him to the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Panthea.</HI> His Slumbers were &s;hort, unea&s;y, and broken; and, at Meals he knew not whether or on what he fed.</P>
<P>At length his Eyes opened to the Ca|lamity of his Condition. But, at the Mo|ment wherein he perceived his Love, he found him&s;elf too far gone for the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of a Return. He was as a Mariner who had haled his Boat up on Land and, thinking him&s;elf &s;ecure, had fallen a&s;leep therein; but, while he &s;lept, a &s;pring Tide came &s;ilently on, and covered the Shore, and gained upon the Beach, and &s;welled under the Boat and heaved it from Land, and turning bore it farther and farther to Sea. Then awaken'd the helple&s;s Mariner unprovided of Sail or Oar, or of any Means to effect or attempt a Return. He &s;aw his lo&s;t E&s;tate, he &s;tretched his Arms to|ward the Land, but while he reached it with his Eyes, he found him&s;elf carried, by an irre&s;i&s;table Power, &s;till more and more di&s;tant from the Sight.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227">
Thus fared it with the wretched, lo&s;t, fallen away <HI>Ara&s;pes.</HI> He awakened to his Condition, he looked around, but found him&s;elf helple&s;s. He would have &s;truggled, he wi&s;hed his Return to Virtue; but his Wi&s;hes were &s;ickly, as feeble as a Dream; and he felt him&s;elf borne away, by a &s;ecret and &s;ubtle Force, from that Honour of which he now barely retained a di&s;tant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The imbo&s;omed Fire that prey'd upon him, at length became in&s;ufferable, and he de&s;perately determined to &s;eek Relief. He threw him&s;elf at the Feet of the Object of his De&s;ires, avowed the Ardour of his Pa&s;&s;ion, and be&s;ought her Pity.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s replied, in a mild but re|&s;olute Accent, I do pity you, <HI>Ara&s;pes,</HI> I pity you the more, as it is all that my Power can ever do for you. Two in&s;ur|mountable Barriers oppo&s;e your De&s;ires, the one is my Honour, the other my In|clination. I am already married to a young Hero, the Prince and Patron of his People, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of his Sex, and an Honour to human Nature. He is my fir&s;t and la&s;t Love, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my Heart wholly; but, were it emptied of him, it would not be emptied of its Virtue; and the Thoughts of any other would be an
<PB N="227" REF="228">Offence to my Soul. Be advi&s;ed then, <HI>Ara&s;pes,</HI> depart from Temptation, and &s;eek, in Ab&s;ence, a Cure for the Indi&s;cretion of your Love.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ed, a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;peechle&s;s, <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> lo&s;t, at once, the little that remained to him of Virtue and Rea&s;on. He knew not what he did, he would have proceeded to Violence; when the Prince&s;s, &s;uddenly, drew a Ponyard and pointed it at her Bo|&s;om. Whereat <HI>Ara&s;pes</HI> &s;trait withdrew, overwhelmed with Shame, Di&s;appointment, and De&s;pair.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had retired, the Prince&s;s took a little Tablet, whereon &s;he in&s;cribed the few following Words.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

</LETTER>
<P>This &s;he di&s;patched to the Monarch by one of her faithful Mutes &mdash; As &s;oon as <HI>Cyrus</HI> had peru&s;ed it, he &s;ighed, and dropt
<PB N="228" REF="229">a Tear, as over the departed Virtue of his be&s;t beloved Friend &mdash; He in&s;tantly &s;ent for <HI>Ara&s;pes. Ara&s;pes</HI> dur&s;t not di&s;|obey. He came indeed, but then he did not dare to look upward.</P>
<P>After a Silence, on both Sides&mdash;<HI>Cyrus</HI> cried out! Whoever thou art, account to me for my Friend, account to me for his Virtue! a Virtue that I deemed to be im|pa&s;&s;able, una&s;&s;ailable. Whereupon, <HI>Ara&s;|pes</HI> made the following mo&s;t memorable of An&s;wers.</P>
<P>As you are but lately entered on your <HI>Greek,</HI> my <HI>Harry,</HI> I will fir&s;t read the Pa&s;|&s;age to you, and then give you the Sen&s;e of it, Word for Word.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign"></P>
<P><Q>O <HI>Cyrus,</HI> it is manife&s;t that I have two Souls. For, if I had but one Soul, it could not be, at once, both <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil;</HI> not a Lover, at the &s;ame Time,
<PB N="229" REF="230">of what is <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>di&s;hone&s;t;</HI> it could not at once <HI>de&s;ire</HI> and be <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to the &s;ame Thing. It is, therefore, mo&s;t evident that we have two Souls; and, when the good Soul hath the Dominion, <HI>good Works</HI> are performed; but <HI>evil Works,</HI> when the evil Soul predomi|nates.</Q></P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry,</HI> you &s;ee there was two Men in one Man, which is the &s;ame Thing as there being two Boys in you. For the Soul is the Man, <HI>Harry,</HI> and the Body is but as a Sign to give Notice to others that &s;uch a Man dwells within.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ince, as you &s;ay and as I find, I have two different Boys or Souls within me; pray, how came they to be different? did the &s;ame God that de&s;ired to make the one Soul good, de&s;ire al&s;o to make the other Soul evil?</P>
<P>Your Que&s;tion, my Darling, is very proper, though very deep. I will however endeavour, to the be&s;t of my Power, to accommodate my An&s;wer to the Weakne&s;s of your Capacity.</P>
<P>God, who is nothing but Goodne&s;s, can|not po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire any kind of Evil; and therefore cannot be, immediately, the Au|thor thereof. But he can make or create
<PB N="230" REF="231">&s;uch poor little in&s;ignificant Beings as you and I are, <HI>Harry;</HI> though all that God, him&s;elf, can do in our Behalf, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly make us good, or excellent, or per|fect, any otherwi&s;e than by informing us with his own Goodne&s;s and Perfections.</P>
<P>This would lead me, my Love, to the unfolding that capital Secret, of which you are not yet &s;u&s;ceptible; a Secret, upon which this World, Sun, Moon, and Stars, with all the Worlds upon Worlds that lie beyond them, depend and hang as your Hat would hang upon yonder Nail.</P>
<P>The Angels that are now in Heaven are great, good, perfect, and glorious Beings; becau&s;e they are filled with the Greatne&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Glory, and Perfection of God. For they know that, of them&s;elves, they are nothing; and that, in them&s;elves they are no other than empty and dark Crea|tures, mere &s;en&s;ible Capacities prepared for the Reception, the Feeling, and Enjoyment of the Light, Virtue, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of their bountiful Creator.</P>
<P>How the Spirit of Man came to be, in it&s;elf, &s;o much wor&s;e than an empty and dark Creature. How it came to be filled and polluted with all Manner of Evil, with Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, abomina|ble Lu&s;ts, Envy, Hatred, Malice, Re|vengefulne&s;s,
<PB N="231" REF="232">and Wrathfulne&s;s. How it further came to have a different Spirit be|gotten within it, informing its Heart and tuneing the Chords thereof to Sentiments of Humility, Charity, Purity, Love, Pa|tience, and Peace; this, <HI>Harry,</HI> is the great Secret, of which you are not yet ca|pable; the Secret, as I told you, whereon the World now hangs, whereby it has been changed, and whereby it will be re|newed.</P>
<P>In the mean Time let it &s;uffice, for you, to feel and to know that your dark Spirit &s;o filled, as I &s;aid, with Evil, is your&s;elf, my <HI>Harry,</HI> is all that you have of the Creature within you: And that the good Spirit, which is begotten within your evil Spirit, is breathed into you by the Power and Spirit of God him&s;elf, in order to op|po&s;e and conquer the Evil, and enlighten the Darkne&s;s, and purify the Foulne&s;s of your &s;elfi&s;h or creaturely Spirit; that you may finally become as the Angels that are in Heaven, filled with the Purity, Glory, and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of your God.</P>
<P>Know therefore from henceforward, and let the Sen&s;e of it &s;ink into your Soul, my Darling, that all the Evil which is in you belongs to your&s;elf, and that all the Good which is in you belongs to your God. That you cannot, in or of your&s;elf, &s;o much as
<PB N="232" REF="233">think a good Thought, or form a good Wi&s;h, or oppo&s;e a &s;ingle Temptation or evil Motion within you. From hence learn to be humble, and to think meanly of your|&s;elf, and not to a&s;cribe to your&s;elf any kind of Goodne&s;s or Virtue; for that would be Sacrilege, it would be to rob God of his peculiar Property of Goodne&s;s. From hence further learn never to prefer your&s;elf to o|thers, or to think better of your&s;elf than of any one living; for, &s;o far as you are a Creature, no one can be viler or faultier than you are; however God may be plea&s;|ed, through his Mercy and Bounty to you, to be better in you than in others.</P>
<P>Never exalt your&s;elf, my <HI>Harry,</HI> nei|ther in Company or Conver&s;ation, of any kind, &s;ay I did this or I did that, or I &s;aid this or I &s;aid that; for, in exalting your|&s;elf, you exalt your own proud and evil Spirit above the good and meek Spirit of God that is in you. Let all Prai&s;e mor|tify and be a Reproach to your Con&s;cience; but take Blame with Patience and Plea&s;ure; in &s;o doing you will approve your&s;elf a Lover of Ju&s;tice, as well as a Lover of your own Reformation.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, my Love, turn your whole Will and Affections, from your own evil Spirit, to the Spirit of God that is in you, for that is the utmo&s;t that any Man can do to|ward
<PB N="233" REF="234">his own Salvation. Reject, &s;purn, and dete&s;t every Motion to Evil; embrace, cheri&s;h, and take to your Heart every Motion to Good; you will thereby ac|quire the never ending Glory of having joined with God, in the Combat and Con|que&s;t that he is de&s;irous of obtaining over all the Guilt, Uncleanne&s;s, and Depravity into which your Nature is fallen.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Andrew</HI> came up with Notice to his Ma&s;ter that the Earl of <HI>Mansfield</HI> was below and reque&s;ted to &s;peak with him. At this <HI>Harry</HI> coloured up and cried, didn't I tell you, Sir, what Trouble I &s;hould bring upon you? Don't be alarmed, my Dear, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> do you &s;tay here. If there is a nece&s;&s;ity for your Appearance, I will &s;end you Word.</P>
<P>The Father of young Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> was, in every Re&s;pect, the rever&s;e of his Son. He had come on Foot, without Atten|dants, was dre&s;&s;ed in a plain napped Coat, and had the Mein and Appearance of an hone&s;t Country Grazier.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I &s;hould think my&s;elf greatly honoured by this Vi&s;it, if I was not &s;o much concerned at the Oc|ca&s;ion of it. I am truly grieved that my Son &s;hould have done &s;uch great Offence to young Lord <HI>Bottom.</HI> Sir, &s;ays the Earl,
<PB N="234" REF="235">I find you have quite mi&s;taken the Intent of my Vi&s;it; I am come to thank your Son for the ju&s;t and noble Le&s;&s;on which he gave to mine; and which he has &s;o forcibly impre&s;&s;ed upon his Memory, as will not, I tru&s;t, permit him &s;o forget it in a hurry. My Lord, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> my little Fellow is very &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;|behaviour in this Bu&s;ine&s;s. He was the fir&s;t to chide him&s;elf, and he told me the Story, very much, I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, to his own Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> rejoined the Earl, after what I have heard of your Boy, from one <HI>Jack Freeman,</HI> a very faithful and intelligent Ser|vant of mine, I am quite impatient to &s;ee him, and there is nothing generous which I am not willing to believe concerning him. My Wife indeed is not, at all Times, in my way of thinking. She has taken her young Lord with her, to Town, to the Doctors; and I am concerned at the Vio|lence of the Re&s;entment which &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed on this Occa&s;ion, as it may be a Means of deferring that Acquaintance and Intimacy, which I heartily wi&s;h to culti|vate with the Family of Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI> But where is this wonderful Boy? I reque&s;t to &s;ee him.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> hereupon, was immediately call|ed down. As he apprehended that he
<PB N="235" REF="236">was &s;ent for to be &s;everely chidden, a lit|tle re&s;entful Haughtine&s;s aro&s;e in his Mind, and &s;trengthened it again&s;t the Violence of the Reproofs that he expected. He there|fore entered with an Air that no way &s;a|voured of Mortification, and made but a cold though &s;olemn Bow to the Earl.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, exclaimed my Lord, what a &s;triking Re&s;emblance! I never &s;aw two Faces or Per&s;ons &s;o much alike. There is no Difference, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> between you and your Son, except what Age has made. Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> &s;miled, and my Lord continued. I always had a Notion that your Heroes were huge Fellows, but here I think we have got Heroi&s;m quite in Miniature. Can this be the one, who as I am told, with a Trip or a Blow, overthrows and demoli&s;h|es all before him? Come to me, my Dear, and give me Leave to &s;alute you.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> re&s;pectfully approached; and my Lord, taking him in his Arms and warm|ly ki&s;&s;ing him, &s;aid, I thank you, my lit|tle Man, for the generous Le&s;&s;on which you gave to my very naughty Boy; and for the Difference with you taught him to make, for the future, between the Sauci|ne&s;s of a Lord and the Sentiments of a Gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="237">
<HI>Harry</HI> felt him&s;elf, at once, di&s;concert|ed, aba&s;ed, and wholly cut down by this Compliment from his Lord&s;hip. At length, recovering him&s;elf, he an&s;wered. You mean to be &s;ure, Sir, to reprove me the more by what you have &s;aid; but if you are in earne&s;t, I'm &s;ure it's a very bad Le&s;&s;on which you teach me, Sir, when you prai&s;e me for my Faults and &s;o en|courage me in them. Faults, my Dear, cried the Earl, I heard of none &s;uch; what do you mean by your Faults? I mean, Sir, that when I told your Son as much as that he was not a Gentleman, it &s;hew'd that I was &s;till le&s;s of the Gentleman my|&s;elf; and I very well de&s;erved the Blow which he gave me for &s;uch an Affront; and I am ready to a&s;k his Pardon when|ever you plea&s;e, my Lord. No, no, my Man, cried Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> you &s;hall never Di&s;grace your&s;elf &s;o much as to make any Submi&s;&s;ions to my naughty Boy. I &s;hall think it no Di&s;grace, quick and affectingly replied <HI>Harry,</HI> to make Submi&s;&s;ions to any one, who is Son to &s;uch a Gentleman as my Lord <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, for &s;ome Time, looked with A&s;toni&s;hment at the Child; when, eagerly catching and pre&s;&s;ing him to his Bo&s;om, he cried out, On my Soul, you are the &s;weete&s;t as well as the noble&s;t Fellow I
<PB N="237" REF="238">was ever acquainted with; and, Sir, I &s;hall think it an Honour to be admitted among your Friends; and that's what I would not &s;ay to many in <HI>Old England.</HI> Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> continued the Earl, if you will give your&s;elf the Trouble to enquire out my little Lodge on the Hill, you will o|blige me; though I envy your Character I &s;hall be glad of your Acquaintance. So &s;aying, Lord <HI>Mansfield</HI> got up, after his blunt Manner, and precipitately with|drew.</P>
<P>On the following Evening, Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> took <HI>Harry</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> into his Study, and taking from his Pocket-Book a Num|ber of Bank Bills, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;ays he, I here make my <HI>Harry</HI> a Pre&s;ent of fifteen hundred Pounds, re&s;erving only to my&s;elf the Privilege of advi&s;ing how it may be laid out and &s;ecured for him to the be&s;t Advantage.</P>
<P>To-morrow Morning you and he are to &s;et out on Foot for <HI>London,</HI> and there to take Lodgings as near to the <HI>Fleet</HI> Pri&s;on as you can conveniently be accommodated. You are then to apply to the Keeper, and to give him a Gratuity for making out a written Li&s;t of all the Pri&s;oners under his Cu&s;tody, with their Quality and Condition annexed, as al&s;o the Sums re&s;pectively due,
<PB N="238" REF="239">and the Terms during which they have been in Confinement.</P>
<P>You are then to enquire from him the &s;everal Characters, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and Merits of all the Pri&s;oners of Note, and to make an Entry thereof in a &s;eparate Paper; but then you are not to depend altogether on his Report. You are to go from Room to Room, to conver&s;e with the Pri&s;oners a|part, and to enquire from each the Cha|racters, Fortunes and Di&s;a&s;ters of the o|thers.</P>
<P>This Inqui&s;ition, in all likelihood, will take you up above a Fortnight. But, above all, remember that tho&s;e, among them, who are mo&s;t affected by the Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of their Fellows, ought to be the principal Objects of your own Charity and Relief.</P>
<P>Let five hundred Pounds of this Money be appropriated to the Enlargement of &s;uch Pri&s;oners as are under Dure&s;s for Sums not amounting to ten Pounds. You will thereby free the Captive; give means of Bread to the Hungry; and re&s;tore to your Country many Members that are wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s, that are al&s;o a dead Weight and Incumbrance upon her.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="240">
Let the remaining thou&s;and Pounds be applied to the Enfranchi&s;ment or Relief of tho&s;e Pri&s;oners of Note, who&s;e Ca&s;es and Calamities call for &s;ingular Compa&s;&s;ion. And be &s;ure to keep an Account, where your Money may fall &s;hort of &s;uch va|luable Purpo&s;es; and, as far as five hun|dred Pounds more will reach, we will &s;up|ply the Defect.</P>
<P>Hereupon, <HI>Harry</HI> caught his Patron a|bout the Neck, and repeatedly ki&s;&s;ing him, cried, O Dada how happy, how very happy you make me! O, that we had Money enough to employ every Fort|night, the Year round, like this &s;weet Fort|night!</P>
<P>The very next Morning our Travellers &s;et out on their generous Expedition. But, we forbear to &s;ay any Thing, relative thereto, till their Return; as they them|&s;elves are the be&s;t qualified and, in Truth, have the be&s;t right to give the Particulars of their own extraordinary Adventures.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Harry</HI> and his Friend <HI>Clement</HI> had not been gone above an Hour, when Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> received a Card from the Counte&s;s of <HI>Maitland</HI> reque&s;ting his Company to Coffee in the Evening. She was Widow
<PB N="240" REF="241">to the late Earl, a very lovely Woman, had taken the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Hou&s;e on the Hill, and was re&s;orted to by Numbers of the fir&s;t Figure, from among whom &s;he was perfectly qualified to make an Elec|tion, exceedingly entertaining to her&s;elf, of the &s;en&s;ible, the elegant, and the ludi|crous.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> attended my Lady preci&s;ely at the Time appointed. When he enter|ed, &s;he was writing a Note at her De&s;k. On turning her Eye to the Door, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;truck with the Grace of his Fi|gure, the Sweetne&s;s of his A&s;pect, and Ea&s;e of his Deportment. She was further &s;truck with a Recollection as of &s;omething very intere&s;ting, but which had happened at a va&s;t Di&s;tance, or of which &s;he had dreamed. Her Heart was affected, &s;he coloured up and again turned pale, with|out being yet able to move from her Chair. At length, recovering, and ri&s;ing, and advancing toward him, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, this is a very &s;ingular Favour, a Favour for which I have long wi&s;hed. This Sir, you know, is my third Time of a&s;king, but my two former Cards were not &s;o happy as to bring you. Madam, &s;aid he carele&s;sly, I am but a very poor Vi|&s;iter; however I could not refu&s;e my&s;elf the Honour of attending your Lady&s;hip's
<PB N="241" REF="242">Summons, at lea&s;t for once. I have been now, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, three Months on the Hill. Within that Time I have ap|plied to all my Acquaintance, in order to get &s;ome of them to introduce me to you, but none of them were &s;o fortunate as to know any of your Name. To be known, Madam, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> a Per&s;on mu&s;t have been, in &s;ome way, con&s;iderable; in|deed it is no way di&s;agreeable to my own Inclinations to pa&s;s the &s;hort Remnant of an in&s;ignificant Life, as little noticed as po&s;&s;ible. I have been ju&s;t writing a Note, Sir, &s;ays my Lady, be &s;o good to amu&s;e your&s;elf for a Moment with the Books and Paintings in my Clo&s;et there, and I will attend you.</P>
<P>Within a few Minutes after Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> had withdrawn, Mr. <HI>Sneer</HI> enter'd. What, cried he, bowing, all alone, Lady <HI>Mait|land?</HI> that's &s;urprizing. Your Sex, it &s;eems, are grown very carele&s;s of Im|provement, when they neglect the Model by which they &s;hould poli&s;h their Manners. O you Wretch, exclaimed the Counte&s;s, what brought you here of all Things? I have a World of Company to be with me this Evening, and if they get but a Hint of your coming, I &s;hall be left as much alone as the Statue in <HI>Bu&s;hy-Park.</HI> Law Madam, cries Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> is it po&s;&s;ible that with all your Di&s;cernment you &s;hould be
<PB N="242" REF="243">&s;o much mi&s;taken? permit me to a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip, that I am plagued out of my Life, by the Solicitations of Numbers of the fir&s;t Quality for my Company. You, you Brute, cried my Lady, your Company courted! it mu&s;t be by <HI>Indians</HI> then, who have a Rea&s;on of their own for wor&s;hipping the Devil; why you make no more of Characters, than a Reaper does of Gra&s;s, when he is cutting down Weeds. O Madam, exclaims Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> they like me never the wor&s;e for that; every one gladly compounds for the maim|ing of their own Character, to have the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e of their Neighbours hewn down. But, pray Madam, what Com|pany do you expect this Evening? Why there is Colonel <HI>Sweetpouder.</HI> Colonel <HI>Sweet|pouder</HI> of all Things? Yes, Sir, and a very fine Gentleman too, in my Opinion. Why Madam, the Man would not want Sen&s;e, it is true, if he had not wholly mi&s;taken the Manners of his Profe&s;&s;ion. He has been, as I am told, in &s;ome trifling En|gagements, but never had the Rudene&s;s to attack his Enemy, without white Gloves. He had like to have lo&s;t his Life, upon a Retreat, by the Delay which he made in &s;earch of his Sword Knot.</P>
<P>Here a Footman enter'd &s;aying, Colonel <HI>Sweetpouder,</HI> my Lady. &mdash; Lady <HI>Maitland,</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="244">&s;ays the Colonel, your truly mo&s;t devoted. More your's than you are any one's, Mr. <HI>Sneer;</HI> you are extremely happy, Sir, in your <HI>tete a tete</HI> with her Lady&s;hip, but People have not always the choice of their Company. Severe, Colonel, very &s;evere upon my Honour, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Sneer.</HI> He who wars on the World, replies the Co|lonel, &s;hould not hope to e&s;cape without a Scratch, Mr. <HI>Sneer;</HI> and I have Faults enough to make me angry with all who are cen&s;orious. Colonel, &s;aid the Coun|te&s;s, Mr. <HI>Sneer</HI> has been railing at me through fifty Families, and is but ju&s;t come to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to rail at my Neigh|bours. On my Soul, Madam, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> I am re&s;olved not to &s;pare the lea&s;t of your Failings, when I am once &s;o in|genious as to di&s;cover where they lie. Your Ju&s;tice, Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> to the Merits of this Lady, exclaims the Colonel, entitles you to &s;ay what you will again&s;t the re&s;t of Womankind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> ju&s;t then re-entering, the Counte&s;s introduced him to her Acquain|tance. I hope in Heaven, Madam, cried Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> that the Company whom you expect may be wholly the rever&s;e of this Gentleman's Appearance! the Mouth of Raillery mu&s;t el&s;e learn the Language of Admiration, and that would be an Ex|change
<PB N="244" REF="245">by no Means &s;uitable to my Ta&s;te. Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> bowed, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Here was rap, rap, rap, rap; and im|mediately Lady <HI>Cribbage</HI>'s Chariot was an|nounced. There now, cries Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> there is the happie&s;t Woman in the Uni|ver&s;e, that's certain. She divides her whole Time between the two Delights of her Life, CARDS and SCANDAL. She is never tired of either, and yet runs from one to the other, that Variety may give the higher Reli&s;h to both.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Cribbage</HI> here entered, in all the Hurry imaginable. She flew and embraced the Counte&s;s with Tran&s;port. My dear deare&s;t Lady <HI>Maitland,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, how hap|py am I to have got to you at la&s;t! Hea|vens, what have I endured before I could get free of that odious <HI>London?</HI> what a Gauntelope have I run! a hundred and fifty Vi&s;its, no le&s;s upon rep: and through &s;uch a Sortment too, as your Mercers &s;ay. But there is no di&s;pen&s;ing with the&s;e Fop|peries; they had all dropt Cards at my Gate; and I coudn't but return the Vi&s;it, in good Manners to my&s;elf you know. There was Lady <HI>Gadabout,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Chat|away,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Tender&s;ides,</HI> and Lady <HI>Frump,</HI> and Lady Dowager <HI>Go&s;&s;ipper,</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Giglett</HI> the merry Mi&s;s of three&s;core, that you know. La Madam, exclaimed
<PB N="245" REF="246">the Counte&s;s, why, the&s;e are all Per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed Fa&s;hion. Ay ay, my dear Friend, replied Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> they are the Noughts of the great World; when &s;uch as Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> are plea&s;ed to figure be|fore them, they acquire a Kind of value; they would not otherwi&s;e be pick'd up &s;hould they drop on the High-Way. &mdash; Colonel <HI>Sweetpouder,</HI> ten thou&s;and Pardons! I really did not ob&s;erve you. &mdash; Your Ser|vant Sir &mdash; a fine Per&s;on! (half whi&s;pering to Lady <HI>Maitland</HI>) &mdash; And you here, Mr. <HI>Sneer?</HI> you are the Man of the World to whom we &s;hould pay our fir&s;t Re&s;pects, if we de&s;ire that our Caps &s;hould &s;it &s;traight, you know.</P>
<P>Why my Lady, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> would you be like the <HI>Turk,</HI> and allow no Bro|ther Slanderer near your Throne? But the Field of Folly and Ridicule is wide enough for us both. Be&s;ides Madam, we a&s;&s;ail in very different Manners; I am like the <HI>Parthian,</HI> no more than a back Stroke and away; but your Lady&s;hip moves on like Time or Death, and mow down your Sex without di&s;tinction before you. O fye Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> what &s;ay you, Sir, can you think &s;o hardly of me? no truly, Madam, an&s;wered Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> I am rather inclined to believe that you only prune. For I have often ob&s;erved that, after very keen Hands, Reputation
<PB N="246" REF="247">&s;prouts anew, and flouri&s;hes the better. O, Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> Lady <HI>Cribbage!</HI> exclaim|ed Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> that's the &s;evere&s;t Thing, upon my Honour, that was &s;aid this Day. What, allow a Lady the Will to do Mi&s;|chief, and not allow her the Power! can any Thing be &s;o provoking? Well, &s;up|po&s;ing it to be &s;o, rejoined Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> I would rather be cut by that Gentleman's Razor than Mr. <HI>Sneer</HI>'s Hatchet. But, apropo', I wonder what keeps Lady <HI>Philligree,</HI> I met her on my la&s;t Vi&s;it, and &s;he told me &s;he had but half a Dozen more to pay and be with us; &s;he brings with her a new Language for the Day, I'll en|gage. That Woman, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> ought to be &s;trung up for minting our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dialect. True, added the Colonel, if her Coin would pa&s;s. Ah Colonel, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> what Species of Folly or Faul|tine&s;s will not acquire Currency, when im|pre&s;&s;ed and uttered by Per&s;ons of Fortune and Figure?</P>
<P>Come, deare&s;t Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> cried Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> while we choice Spirits are got together, let us know what Company you have &s;ummoned for the Evening. I hope in Goodne&s;s you have laid in a &s;ufficient Fund for Merriment. I &s;hould droop to Death, if the Propriety of their Manners left no Room for Laughter. Fear not, &s;aid
<PB N="247" REF="248">the Counte&s;s, but mark the Characters as they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, there is Sir <HI>Bumkin Toilette.</HI> Mo&s;t excellent, exclaimed Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> the amphibious Wretch! he that is &s;o like an Otter, between his Country Breeding that he can't get rid of, and his Court Breeding that he can't a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>Again, there is Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> Earl of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> lately come to the Hill. Ay, added the Colonel, there is the Sample that Nature gave us when &s;he intended to &s;hew what Man ought to be. He, the Bear, cries <HI>Sneer;</HI> for Heaven's &s;ake, Co|lonel, how can you prai&s;e a Man who&s;e Manners are &s;o wholly the rever&s;e of your own? I allow that he has Talents and Learning, though he &s;eems to know no|thing about the Matter; and he piques him&s;elf, &s;olely, on the mo&s;t plebeian of all Virtues, that of being an HONEST MAN. Do you know him, Mr. <HI>Fenton?</HI> ju&s;t e|nough, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> to make me fear that I &s;hould rather afford Matter of Ridicule to his Lord&s;hip, than hope to be merry at his Expence. I have been told, &s;aid <HI>Sneer,</HI> that, on his Return from his Travels, he was an accompli&s;hed <HI>Cavalier,</HI> but he &s;uddenly took a di&s;gu&s;t to all Man|ner of Politene&s;s; and I que&s;tion, at this Moment, if there are five Men in <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="249">to whom he would &s;ay, <HI>your Servant!</HI> and I am confident, added the Colonel, that there are not five Men in <HI>England,</HI> whom he would not &s;erve.</P>
<P>Talk not of him, dear Colonel, exclaim|ed Lady <HI>Cribbage;</HI> he &s;ays more &s;hocking Things, in fewer and &s;impler Words, than any <HI>Cynic</HI> that ever breathed. Be|cau&s;e Madam, rejoined the Colonel, he is too much our Friend to hurt us by Flat|tery, and he never reproves but with an Intention to reform. Well, well, cried <HI>Sneer,</HI> I own there is not much Matter for Laughter in his Character. Let us call another Cau&s;e. Who comes next, Lady <HI>Maitland?</HI></P>
<P>The Widow <HI>Mawkin,</HI> &s;ays the Coun|te&s;s, the huge <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Fortune. She who keeps three marriageable Daughters in the Nur&s;ery, for fear People &s;hould be &s;o im|pertinent as to enquire who brought them into the World. She is not yet in de&s;pair of a third Jointure. And &s;he would bribe others, by her Smiles, to be as forgetful of her Age as &s;he is her&s;elf. I never &s;ee her, cries Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> but &s;he puts me in mind of a May-Morning, when the long Pole is awkardly hung with Flowers and Garlands. She has been equally hap|py, adds Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> in adorning her Mind
<PB N="249" REF="250">with the Flowers of Science, and is as ri|diculou&s;ly affected in the Parade of her Learning as &s;he is of her Dre&s;s. I could pity or pardon all this, &s;ays the Colonel, if &s;he were not &s;o mercile&s;s in her Cen|&s;ures, on an Article of Female Virtue, to a &s;ingle Breach of which no Man living will ever lead Mrs. <HI>Mawkin</HI> into Tempta|tion. But, have you any more Blocks, Madam, for the hewing out of our Mer|curies?</P>
<P>Yes yes, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, there's e|nough to laugh with, and enough to laugh at, I warrant you. There's our Friend <HI>Billy Bu&s;tle.</HI> O Lud! &s;cream'd La|dy <HI>Cribbage,</HI> I wi&s;h I had brought another Gown; this is he who is always &s;o bu&s;y where there's nothing to do; he is &s;o full of his Friend&s;hips that you never can e&s;|cape without &s;ome Damage; and he &s;poils you a Suit of Brocade in his hurry to reach you your Coffee.</P>
<P>Then, &s;ays the Counte&s;s, there's Mi&s;s <HI>Trinket.</HI> O the pretty Bauble, cries Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> whoever marries her will have &s;ome|thing to hang to his Watch. Again, there is <HI>Franc Faddle,</HI> who&s;e Company is &s;o uni|ver&s;ally courted. That's what amazes me of all Things, cried the Colonel, the in|&s;en&s;ible Wretch! he is quite callous to the
<PB N="250" REF="251">keene&s;t Sting of Satire; the Fool is good humoured, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed; he is &s;o de&s;irous of promoting Merriment, that he actually enjoys the Laugh that is rai&s;ed at his own Expence. It is then no longer, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> any Matter of Wonder that his Company &s;hould be &s;ought after, &s;ince all love to laugh, but very few to be laughed at.</P>
<P>There was a My&s;tery in the Behaviour of Mr. <HI>Faddle,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Sneer,</HI> that no one dreamed of. I happened, &s;ome Time &s;ince, to be in Company where he had &s;et him&s;elf up as a Butt to be &s;hot at. The Novelty of the Thing &s;urprized me. I examined him with Attention. I remark|ed the Cleverne&s;s of the Addre&s;s with which he u&s;ed to turn the Joke upon him|&s;elf; and I di&s;cerned, under his Submi&s;&s;ion to the Triumph of others, an Under&s;tand|ing quite &s;uperior to that of his Ralliers. In a few Months after, I happened to join him in a private Walk. Mr. <HI>Faddle,</HI> &s;aid I, I can't conceive why you &s;hould offer your&s;elf, as an Object of Je&s;t and Ridicule, to People infinitely your Inferiors in every Thing except Fortune.</P>
<P>I am no longer under that Nece&s;&s;ity, an&s;wered <HI>Faddle.</HI> You &s;ee I am in Mourn|ing. A Relation has lately left me &s;even hundred a Year. You are the fir&s;t, Mr.
<PB N="251" REF="252"><HI>Sneer,</HI> who had the Di&s;cernment to detect me, and are entitled that I &s;hould Account to you for my Behaviour.</P>
<P>I am a younger Brother. Early in Life, I was left wholly dependent on my Mo|ther's &s;mall Jointure; and Experience quickly &s;hewed me that the Countenances of all about me caught a Coldne&s;s and Di&s;|regard from the Knowledge of my narrow Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>How to remedy this Evil; how to pro|cure an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Golden Idol before whom all Nations and Languages fall pro|&s;trate,</HI> was the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf in a World where a Ge|nius for Pimping; or a Genius for Knavery was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the Acqui&s;i|tion of Favour. I was &s;o unfortunate as to want Talents for tho&s;e valuable Pur|po&s;es. I could not even betray an Enemy, to &s;erve a Friend. I therefore found my|&s;elf excluded from the Patrons of the pre|&s;ent Age, as I could neither contribute to the Modes of their Intere&s;t or the Modes of their Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>At length, I thought upon the Stratagem that &s;urprized you. It requires no greater Art, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, than to be wi&s;e and humble, wi&s;e enough to acquie&s;ce in be|ing
<PB N="252" REF="253">deemed a Fool, and humble enough to &s;ubmit as a Foot&s;tool, for others to rai&s;e them&s;elves, in their own Opinion, and in the Eyes of the Company.</P>
<P>My Project &s;ucceeded beyond Expecta|tion. I was admitted to an Intimacy with the Chiefs of the Land. My Company was coveted and &s;ought by all the Great; and happy was the Peer who could boa&s;t, to his Vi&s;itants, he &s;hould have <HI>Faddle</HI> to Supper.</P>
<P>Mean Time, I was by no Means a Je&s;t for all. I knew how to turn the Ridicule upon &s;uch of your middling Gentry as pre|&s;umed to laugh like their Betters; and I never failed to pull down tho&s;e from who&s;e Intere&s;t or Favour I had nothing to ex|pect.</P>
<P>I had a Number of the&s;e Right Ho|nourable Patrons, each of whom would gladly have engro&s;&s;ed me to him&s;elf. They all contributed to make me reli&s;h the Je&s;t. Independent of very con&s;idera|ble Pre&s;ents, they have procured me &s;ome pretty Sinecures to the amount of about &s;ix hundred Pounds a Year. So that you &s;ee Mr. <HI>Sneer,</HI> I am now in a fair Way of being enabled to fee others to permit me, in my Turn, to laugh at them.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
I do not feel in my&s;elf, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> a thorough Approbation of this Gentle|man's Character. There is &s;omething un|amiable in every Species of Impo&s;ition; and even the Merit of Mr. <HI>Faddle</HI>'s Hu|mility receives great Alloy from its Di&s;|ingenuity. His good Sen&s;e however is laudable, &s;ince his Intention was innocent, with Re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons upon whom he practi&s;ed his Stratagem. Does he bring up the Rear of your Vi&s;itants, Lady <HI>Mait|land?</HI></P>
<P>No, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, we have Lady <HI>Home&s;pun,</HI> with an <HI>et cetera</HI> of no Charac|ters, yet to come.&mdash;<HI>Home&s;pun!</HI> exclaim|ed Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> upon my Word, the be&s;t Sort of a Gammer of Quality that I know. The good Woman would really be &s;en&s;ible Company, if &s;he was not &s;o utter|ly void of Education. Could you think how the poor Creature expo&s;ed her Ig|norance t'other Day? &s;he popped in where I was engaged at four handed <HI>Cribbige.</HI> Having peer'd over the Game with va&s;t Sagacity; what, &s;ays &s;he, I think your Lady&s;hip has got to your old Game of <HI>Quadrille.</HI> Ha, ha, ha! Lady <HI>Home&s;pun,</HI> I fancy, is one of tho&s;e who think of gett|ing into a Fa&s;hion, exactly at the Period that others have got out.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="255">
Madam, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, if Lady <HI>Home&s;pun</HI> had Time to &s;pare, from the Duties of Religion and a Life of Benevo|lence, &s;he would undoubtedly employ it in &s;tudying Matters more &s;uitable to your Lady&s;hip's Ta&s;te. Her Peccadillos, how|ever, are pardonable on Account of her Plea&s;antry; for while &s;he laughs, with great Ju&s;tice, at the Follies of high Life; &s;he laughs at her&s;elf al&s;o, with great good Humour, for being &s;o &s;en&s;ibly out of the Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Here again was a loud rapping; and the Peals were repeated, with little intermi&s;|&s;ion, till all the Company arrived. They &s;ucceeded &s;o quickly, that Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> had &s;carce Time to receive each of them with a Di&s;tinction, and Manner of Addre&s;s, that &s;he judged mo&s;t agreeable to their Humours and Characters.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, Mrs. <HI>Philligree</HI> ru&s;hed in and cried, Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> I am mo&s;t &s;u|perlatively your's. I am your's, Madam, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, po&s;itively, beyond all Compari&s;on.&mdash;Such a Stranger as Mi&s;s <HI>Trinket!</HI> you have enquired the Way at la&s;t, then. I felicitate you, Mi&s;s, on your new Acqui&s;ition. I am told that your Green Monkey is ab&s;olutely the greate&s;t Beau, and the greate&s;t Wit, within the

Her Grace has Company this Evening and looks for you, without Que&s;|tion.

Dear Madam, how extremely rich and elegant is all this! and how conde&s;cending, in a Lady of your Ta&s;te, to appear to owe any Thing to Dre&s;s and outward Ornament. O, Mr. <HI>Bu&s;tle,</HI> thrice welcome! our Sex may now boa&s;t of having a Servant. For, the&s;e other Man-Creatures are &s;o li&s;tle&s;s, or &s;o aukward, as not to merit a Curt&s;ey in the way of Wages&mdash;My Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> this is more than an Honour, it is a Bene|fit. If &s;ome of us are not improved before you leave us; I &s;hall, for my own Part, take great Blame to my&s;elf&mdash;My dear Lady <HI>Home&s;pun!</HI> how are the &s;weet Babies? how are your obliging Dome&s;tics, how are all your Cats and Dogs? believe me, I
<PB N="256" REF="257">take an Intere&s;t in the Harmony and good Humour of every Thing about you. I think, &s;aid Lady <HI>Home&s;pun,</HI> they all begin to droop, &s;ince your Lady&s;hip has cea&s;ed to make them happy by your Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> looking about, perceived Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> turn'd precipitately to him and, catching him in his Arms, Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> he cried, how glad I am to meet you, what an Advantage I &s;hall e&s;teem it at all Times and in all Places! how is my <HI>Harry,</HI> my little Hero? Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> bowed twice.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid the Counte&s;s, Tea and Coffee! and order the Tables and Cards to be laid in the next Room. Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> what News? you are an Inti|mate of all the Foreign Cabinets.</P>
<P>Our dome&s;tic News, an&s;wered the Earl, is by far the mo&s;t extraordinary. It is affirmed that our Freeholders, throughout the Shires and Burroughs of <HI>England,</HI> have entered into a Re&s;olution again&s;t Bribery and Corruption.</P>
<P>Our Parliament al&s;o have this Moment, in agitation, an Act for e&s;tabli&s;hing the two Virtues of PROBITY and CHASTI|TY, re&s;pectively, among the Sexes. To this Act they further propo&s;e to add &s;eve|ral
<PB N="257" REF="258">Clau&s;es, in the Nature of a Codicil annexed to a Will. Among others, it is intended to make a general Exchange of the Forms of good Manners, for the Of|fices of good Nature; and all Acts of Be|nevolence are hereafter to pa&s;s, by an im|mutable Law, for Proofs of high Breed|ing.</P>
<P>It is further to be enacted, that every Courtier or great Man may be &s;ued upon his Promi&s;e; or even on &s;uch Intimations of Nods, Smiles, or Whi&s;pers, or Squeezes by the Hand, as may credibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to keep People in Expectation. No Ad|vantage is to be taken of Ignorance by any Trader, nor of Innocence in the Com|merce between the Sexes. The Glow of Mode&s;ty is the only Rouge that will be al|lowed to any fair Face of Quality, in the&s;e his Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P>No Per&s;on of any Station, will hereafter be permitted to go abroad in &s;earch of Faults, till they can find none at Home by the help of a Candle.

<PB N="263" REF="264">From thence Lord <HI>Freelove</HI> wrote to his Friend, a long Letter filled with peniten|tial Apologies, wherein he offered him the Di&s;po&s;al of his Fortune and Intere&s;t, as a &s;mall Compen&s;ation for having robbed him of &s;o very valuable a Trea&s;ure.

Mr. <HI>Faddle</HI>'s Remark on the Con&s;cienti|ou&s;ne&s;s of Libertines, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> re|minds me of <HI>Jack Wilding,</HI> a quondam Acquaintance of mine. I had the Story from him&s;elf; it is an Adventure of which he boa&s;ted; and the Recital, in his Opinion, did by no Means detract from his Charac|ter, as a Gentleman.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilding</HI> was of a neighbouring Country, and was educated by pious Pa|rents, in a &s;crupulous Ob&s;ervance of his Duties to God and Man. When they thought him confirmed in his civil and re|ligious Principles, they &s;ent him here to &s;tudy our Laws in the Middle Temple; where he &s;peedily learned that Plea&s;ure was the only Good, and that the Laws of Nature were irrever&s;ible by any &s;ub&s;equent Appointments. However, he piqued him|&s;elf extremely on what is called the Punc|tilio of Honour, and would run any Man through the Body who &s;hould intimate that he had been guilty of an unju&s;t or unge|nerous Action.</P>
<P><HI>Wilding</HI> was a young Fellow of Parts and Plea&s;antry, and &s;till pre&s;erved a very &s;pecious Appearance of Virtue. A con&s;i|derable <HI>London</HI> Merchant conceived a Friend&s;hip for him; and, when he was
<PB N="265" REF="266">taken under Arre&s;t, on Account of &s;ome Debts and a Failure of Remittances, his new Friend advanced two hundred Pounds in his Favour, and made him a general In|vitation to his Table.</P>
<P>The Merchant had lately married a lovely young Woman, who lo&s;t nothing of her Lu&s;tre in the Eyes of Mr. <HI>Wilding.</HI> For the &s;ake of the Wife, he ingratiated him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible with the Hu&s;|band. He &s;pent a large Portion of his Time at their Hou&s;e; and while his Friend was abroad, or engaged in the Counting Room, he endeavoured, by a winning Addre&s;s, and a thou&s;and A&s;&s;iduities, to thieve from him the conjugal Affections of a Woman, on who&s;e Virtue he depo&s;ited his Hopes and Delights, all the Honours of his Family, and all his Peace and Pro&s;|pect in Life.</P>
<P><HI>Wilding,</HI> in order to e&s;tabli&s;h his Credit with the Merchant, had punctually reim|bur&s;ed him his two hundred Pounds. A Nobleman, to whom the Dice had been lately unfavourable, made him an Offer of a Place at Court on a preliminary Com|pliment of a thou&s;and Pounds. <HI>Wilding</HI> con&s;ulted his Friend on this advantageous Propo&s;al. The Merchant had not the Money but promi&s;ed to procure it, and, in his Eagerne&s;s to promote the Fortune
<PB N="266" REF="267">of this Traitor, he went directly and &s;oli|citou&s;ly abroad for the Purpo&s;e. This was an Opportunity which a Man of his Gal|lantry could not neglect. The grateful Mr. <HI>Wilding</HI> accordingly &s;eized upon it to accompli&s;h the Fate of his Benefactor; and the happie&s;t Lot he left him was, ignorantly, to contribute toward the be|getting of Sons and Daughters who, like Maggots, were to be propagated from the Bed of Pollution.</P>
<P>If I didn't fear to be tedious, &s;aid Lady <HI>Home&s;pun,</HI> I could give you a recent In|&s;tance of Ingratitude even greater than that which Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> has mentioned, and attended with Circum&s;tances that affected me extremely. The Company in&s;tantly urged her to gratify their Curio&s;ity, and &s;he began as follows.</P>
<P>Some Weeks ago, I &s;ent to the Ser|vants Office to enquire for a Female of &s;ome Education, who might a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the In&s;truction of my little Girls. The Day following a young Woman came to be hired. Her Appearance was mo&s;t be&s;peaking; and, with a Countenance expre&s;&s;ive of every Virtue, &s;he look'd a Renunciation of the &s;malle&s;t Title there|to.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
I a&s;ked for her Character, but &s;he an|&s;wered, with an Air of the deepe&s;t Humi|liation, that &s;he never had been at Service; that &s;he was an unfortunate Stranger who de&s;erved no one's good Word, and that &s;he had nothing to a&s;k but my Acceptance of her Labour, and the Shelter of my Roof.</P>
<P>I had not the Heart to reject her; and on Trial I found that &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of the polite Languages, and of every female Accompli&s;hment, though &s;he did not &s;eem to have reached her two and twentieth Year.</P>
<P>She grew extremely fond of my Chil|dren. She u&s;ed to look with a melancho|ly Kind of Plea&s;ure upon them; and fre|quently during the Times of her dre&s;&s;ing or in&s;tructing them, I ob&s;erved her Tears &s;triving to &s;teal away unnoticed.</P>
<P>This, with the thou&s;and Elegancies that accompanied her Words and Actions, made me impatient to know whence and who &s;he was. She perceived my Curio&s;ity and with a befeeching and mortified Air, ah Madam! &s;aid &s;he, &s;eek not to hate me; &s;eek not to know the Story of my Shame, &s;ince it cannot be told without reflecting
<PB N="268" REF="269">Di&s;credit on Per&s;ons of Worth and Ho|nour.</P>
<P>The Day after, Sir <HI>Hanmer Home&s;pun</HI> came in, where <HI>Peggy,</HI> for &s;o &s;he called her&s;elf, was chatting with my little Girls at the further End of the Room. I am come, my Dear, &s;aid he, from a Vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>Grace,</HI> the new Acquaintance in who&s;e Prai&s;e you heard me &s;peak &s;o largely. I enquired out his Hou&s;e and went up with|out Ceremony. As I entered his Cham|ber, I was &s;truck with a new and very affecting Object. He &s;at oppo&s;ite to a Pier Gla&s;s wherein I ob&s;erved him, un|noticed; and on each Knee he held an Infant, over whom he wept plentifully, while he care&s;&s;ed them, in Turns, and ten|perly pre&s;s'd them to his Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At length he perceived me and ro&s;e in Confu&s;ion. You have caught me, Sir <HI>Hanmer,</HI> &s;aid he, lamenting the Lo&s;s of a fal&s;e Woman, whom yet I cannot cea&s;e to love, and who&s;e Fault has not been able to abate my Fondne&s;s for the&s;e her inno|cent Offspring. The mi&s;guided Wretch, while I was lately in the Country, eloped with Lord <HI>Riot</HI> from her own Honour and Happine&s;s. Lord <HI>Riot</HI> has &s;ince paid his Tre&s;pa&s;s with his Life, but what is become of my <HI>Peggy</HI> I know not. Can I depend on your Goodne&s;s to enquire her out? 'tis
<PB N="269" REF="270">a Pity that One &s;o lovely &s;hould be utter|ly lo&s;t. Here is a Bill for &pound;500, di&s;po&s;e of it, my Friend, as you think be&s;t for her Advantage, and let not her Nece&s;&s;ities plunge her deeper in Guilt.</P>
<P>Here the Children &s;hriek'd out, and cried that <HI>Peggy</HI> was dead, their <HI>Peggy</HI> was dead! We in&s;tantly ran to 'em, and found her in a Fit, in which &s;he continued &s;eve|ral Hours without Sign of Life. As &s;oon as &s;he opened her Eyes, &s;he turned them languidly upon me. Ah Madam! &s;aid &s;he, you know me now. I am faulty in|deed, but much more unfortunate. And, as you were lately de&s;irous to hear my Sto|ry, you &s;hall have it without Extenuation or Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>I am Daughter to a poor Farmer who was Tenant to the Father of Mr. <HI>Grace.</HI> When I was about nine Years old, the young Gentleman, who was lately return|ed from the College, happened to be out a Sporting, and called in at my Father's. I con&s;idered him as a Species quite different from all I had &s;een of Man. His Pre&s;ence gave me a Plea&s;ure till then unfelt, and his Parting was as the Lo&s;s of &s;omething extremely dear.</P>
<P>From that Time he cho&s;e our Part of the Country for the Scene of his Diver&s;i|ons,
<PB N="270" REF="271">and his Vi&s;its became longer and more frequent. He never failed to bring me &s;ome little Pre&s;ent, and I betrayed my Affection by many artle&s;s Te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>In about three Years, old Mr. <HI>Grace</HI> died. My Father got, no one knew how, into plentiful Circum&s;tances, and &s;ent me to a boarding School where I was carefully educated in all the becomming Matters of which I was capable.</P>
<P>I now began to apprehend from whom my Advantages flowed, and my young Heart was penetrated with the mo&s;t lively and affecting Gratitude. I grew more re|&s;erved however, as my Sentiments grew more ardent; and, whenever my Benefac|tor came to vi&s;it me, we appeared under a mutual Re&s;traint from the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Pa&s;&s;ions, which I thought it indecent, and he un&s;ea&s;onable to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>When I arrived to the Age of &s;ixteen Years, Mr. <HI>Grace</HI> publickly addre&s;&s;ed me for Marriage. Can you think it, Madam, that while my Heart embraced the Over|ture with the warme&s;t Tran&s;port; it was yet with the &s;tronge&s;t Reluctance, that I yielded to a Happine&s;s which I deemed &s;o injurious to the Honour and Intere&s;t of him whom I loved, as I loved my own Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="272">
Five Years, the happie&s;t &s;ure that ever were pa&s;&s;ed upon Earth, I lived ble&s;&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ed by my Heart's cho&s;en Ma&s;ter, and bore him three lovely Re&s;emblances of the Image that was always pre&s;ent to my Soul.</P>
<P>One Night Mr. <HI>Grace,</HI> returning later than u&s;ual, brought home a wounded Gen|tleman, but entered as privately as po&s;&s;ible for fear of alarming me. This Gentleman was Lord <HI>Riot,</HI> who&s;e Life Mr. <HI>Grace</HI> had &s;aved, at the Peril of his own, from the Re&s;entment of an injured Hu&s;band who had &s;et upon him with Advantage.</P>
<P>As it was feared that his Wounds were mortal, the Surgeons advi&s;ed that he &s;hould not be removed, and he lay &s;ix Weeks at our Hou&s;e, where, induced by Ho&s;pitality and the De&s;ire of my Hu&s;band, I attended him with a Care and Tenderne&s;s that he rewarded with Perdition.</P>
<P>When he took his Leave of us, he &s;eemed to labour under a Sen&s;e of in&s;uf|ferable Obligations. As &s;oon as his Health was e&s;tabli&s;hed, he &s;ent me a Diamond Necklace of great Value; but Mr. <HI>Grace</HI> was then in the Country, and I directly returned the Traitor's Pre&s;ent. The next Day he &s;ent up his Name and reque&s;ted to
<PB N="272" REF="273">be admitted; but I excu&s;ed my&s;elf from receiving the Vi&s;its of Gentlemen in the Ab&s;ence of my Hu&s;band. The Day fol|lowing however, having bribed my Ser|vants, he was permitted to enter my Chamber; when, without addre&s;&s;ing a Word to his Lord&s;hip, I &s;everely rebuked my Maid for &s;uch an in&s;olent Intru&s;ion, and withdrawing ha&s;tily to my Clo&s;et, I clapt to the Door.</P>
<P>After this I heard no more of Lord <HI>Riot</HI> for &s;ome Time, but, alas! he and his diabolical In&s;truments were not idle. One Evening, being &s;eized with an unaccount|able Drowzine&s;s, I lay down and was in|&s;en&s;ible to every Thing that pa&s;&s;ed, till I awakened the Day following in a &s;trange Bed, and in the Arms of my cruel and ac|cur&s;ed Undoer.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly &s;creamed out and, pu&s;hing him violently from me, &s;prung into the Floor. While I huddled on my Cloaths, all the Horrors of my Condition ro&s;e full upon my View. I flew to the Door, but finding it locked, I was &s;eized with &s;udden Madne&s;s. I da&s;hed the Piers and Jars to Shivers. I caught whatever came in my way and threw it at the Villain who, ter|rified by my Fury, made his E&s;cape through a back Door and bolted it after him.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">
Some Women whom he &s;ent to me re|covered me from a Fit. The dear and tender Images of Hu&s;band and Children then came to my Mind. My Rage was drowned in my Grief, I wept and &s;obbed without cea&s;ing.</P>
<P>For three Weeks I continued thus im|mured and incon&s;olable, my Fits of Frenzy &s;till returning whenever Lord <HI>Riot</HI> pre&s;ent|ed him&s;elf to my View. At length I a&s;|&s;umed the Patience to expo&s;tulate with him on the irretrievable Ruin he had brought upon me, my Wreck of Fame and Honour, and what was infinitely wor&s;e, my Lo&s;s of Hu&s;band and Children, to who&s;e Faces I never more &s;hould dare to lift an Eye.</P>
<P>While I continued to reproach my Be|trayer, we heard a Bu&s;tle below Stairs. He flew to &s;ome Pi&s;tols that hung in the Apartment. The Door bur&s;t open. My Hu&s;band &s;uddenly entered. Lord <HI>Riot</HI> fired at him, and &s;omebody fell. But I waited not to enquire into the I&s;&s;ue of the Scuffle. The Face of my injured Hu&s;|band was now more dreadful to me than that of my Ravi&s;her. The Doors lay open. I hurried to the Street. I flew along I knew not where, and running into
<PB N="274" REF="275">a little Shop, I &s;at down by the Counter, and fainted away.</P>
<P>The poor Woman of that little Hou&s;e behaved her&s;elf toward me with much Hu|manity. I told her Part of my unhappy Story. And, as I determied for ever to hide my&s;elf from Family and Acquaintance, and as far as po&s;&s;ible from the World; &s;he put me in the way of getting into Ser|vice, whereby I have received the only Con&s;olation of which I am capable, on this Side the Grave, that of your Lady&s;hip's Favour and Protection.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>Grace</HI> clo&s;ed her di&s;tre&s;sful Hi&s;tory. As Sir <HI>Hanmer</HI> and I greatly pi|tied and e&s;teemed her, we endeavoured to give her Comfort, by ob&s;erving that there was nothing in this Adventure, wherewith the mo&s;t cen&s;orious, or even a Hu&s;band of the mo&s;t delicate Sentiments could re|proach her. Ah Madam, &s;aid &s;he, when my Body was as pure as my Spirit, I was every way unworthy of Mr. <HI>Grace,</HI> and &s;hall I now bring Pollution to his honoura|ble Bo&s;om? How will the World interpret my re&s;iding three Weeks in the Hou&s;e and Cu&s;tody of a Libertine? Alas, I have no Portion &s;ave Di&s;grace to bequeath to my dear Infants, nor any Legacy to my Kin|dred but Confu&s;ion of Face. But&mdash;I
<PB N="275" REF="276">feel that I ha&s;ten to the End of my Sor|rows.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke her Countenance altered, and we per&s;uaded her to lye down and try to take &s;ome Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Within an Hour or two after, a Gentle|man came and ha&s;tily enquired for my Hu&s;band. It was Mr. <HI>Grace.</HI> My dear Sir <HI>Hanmer,</HI> &s;aid he eagerly, rejoice with me! my <HI>Peggy</HI> is innocent, &s;he is virtuous as ever. That Ruffian Lord <HI>Riot,</HI> by the Promi&s;e of a thou&s;and Guineas, prevailed on her Woman to give her a &s;leeping Po|tion, and had her conveyed to his Hou&s;e during her State of In&s;en&s;ibility. O my <HI>Peggy,</HI> might I but behold you once again! <HI>Riot,</HI> finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ubdue her to his Plea&s;ure, refu&s;ed to pay the Woman the Price of her Perfidy, and &s;he in Re|venge told me where he held my Wife &s;ecreted. O my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, my &s;hamefaced Angel, what is become of you? I took out a Replevin and forced my way into the Villain's Hou&s;e. He aimed a Pi&s;tol at me, but happened to &s;hoot his Accomplice. He then drew his Sword, but at the &s;e|cond Pa&s;s I pierced him to the Heart. The Traitre&s;s did not immediately die of her Wound; &s;he &s;urvived till within this Hour, and in her mortal Agonies &s;he re|vealed
<PB N="276" REF="277">to me all the Circum&s;tances of this diabolical Plot.</P>
<P>Here we con&s;oled Mr. <HI>Grace,</HI> by in|forming him that his Lady was &s;afe and in the Hou&s;e, but that &s;he was &s;omething in|di&s;po&s;ed and had lain down to re&s;t. His Impatience was too great to be re&s;trained from &s;eeing her. I entered her Chamber fir&s;t, and appri&s;ed her of his coming. As he tenderly approached, &s;he &s;tarted up in her Bed, and her Bo&s;om was agitated with agonizing Emotions. She gazed wildly at him. She attempted to &s;peak but could not find Utterance; when &s;eizing his Hand, and catching it to her Lips, &s;he &s;unk down gently, and expired upon the Pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>As &s;ome of the Company &s;till continued to honour Lady <HI>Home&s;pun</HI>'s pathetic Nar|ration with their Tears. Lady <HI>Cribbage</HI> cried out, Cards, Cards here immediately, to drive away Melancholy!</P>
<P>After Cards, an elegant Supper was &s;erved up; and after Supper the Conver|&s;ation happened to turn upon Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Is it not amazing, cried <HI>Sneer,</HI> (with a &s;arca&s;tical Glance at the Ladies) is it not amazing to think that the Nature and Rea&s;on of Things &s;hould be &s;o wholly in|verted
<PB N="277" REF="278">as, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to mean and effect the very Rever&s;e of their original In|tention and In&s;titution? the fir&s;t u&s;e that was made of the <HI>Fig-Leaf</HI> demon&s;trates that <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> was &s;olely appointed for the co|vering of Shame and Nakedne&s;s. And yet Woman has been &s;o ingenious, in Proce&s;s of Time, as to turn the Lo&s;s of her Robe of original Innocence, into Matter of Pride and O&s;tentation.</P>
<P>The covering from Cold as well as from Shame, &s;aid <HI>Faddle,</HI> may be allowed of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible U&s;e, with re&s;pect to <HI>Dre&s;s;</HI> at lea&s;t among us who are placed &s;o far North of the Tropic.</P>
<P>Our Neighbour <HI>Lewis,</HI> la&s;t Winter, had Occa&s;ion to pa&s;s through the Streets of <HI>Paris.</HI> His travelling Palace was drawn by eight white Steeds. The Fro&s;t was inten&s;ely &s;harp; the Gla&s;&s;es were all drawn up; and this warm Enterprizer for univer|&s;al Monarchy &s;at &s;hivering amid&s;t the wrappings of his Furrs and Robeings.</P>
<P>As he pa&s;&s;ed, he e&s;pied a young Man of a portly Per&s;onage, &s;tanding at an An|gle, clad in a &s;ingle Silk Coat, with his Hair powdered out, and his Hat under his Arm.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="279">
<HI>Lewis</HI> in&s;tantly pulled the Bell; his Coach &s;topped; he let down a &s;ide Win|dow; he ordered the Stranger to be call|ed; and, as nothing makes a Man &s;o mannerly as the &s;en&s;ible want of &s;omething from the Party to whom he applies, the Monarque addre&s;&s;ed him with the mo&s;t gracious and affable Air, and reque&s;ted to know by what Means he could keep him|&s;elf &s;o warm, in &s;uch Extremity of Wea|ther.</P>
<P>That, Sire, an&s;wered the Stranger, is a Secret which my Honour forbids me to reveal, and which nothing &s;hall extort from me, &s;ave the Commands of your Ma|je&s;ty. I promi&s;e you, Sir, &s;aid the King, that I &s;hall not be ungrateful, and that you &s;hall have no Cau&s;e to repent your having entru&s;ted me with your Recipe. I engage then, Sire, that provided you fol|low my Pre&s;cription, there &s;hall not be &s;o warm a Monarch in the Univer&s;e. I am impatient, pray inform me, what am I to do? As I do, &s;o plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, put your whole Wardrobe upon your Back! the King laughed him&s;elf into a Heat, and that very Hour ordered a Commi&s;&s;ion in his own Guards to be made out for his Pre&s;criber.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">
Your Story, Mr. <HI>Faddle,</HI> is elegantly fa|cetious, &s;aid Lady <HI>Maitland.</HI> I apprehend however that other valuable Purpo&s;es are an&s;wered by <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> over and above the mere <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> of Cloathing. Were it not for the various Di&s;tinctions of <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> it would be impo&s;&s;ible to point out the &s;everal Orders of Men throughout the re&s;pective Subordinations that are ne|ne&s;&s;ary to Society. Without this u&s;eful Expedient, we &s;hould be in utter Confu|&s;ion, we &s;hould not know who was who; we &s;hould not know to whom Re&s;pect or Obedience was due, nor be able to a&s;cer|tain the Prince from the Pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>O lud, cried Mrs. <HI>Mawkin,</HI> as your La|dy&s;hip &s;ays, how frightfully humbling and mortifying it would be! without the Rich|ne&s;s of <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> how &s;hould we of the Grand Monde &s;hew any Difference between our|&s;elves and vile Plebeians?</P>
<P>O Madam, an&s;wered Lady <HI>Cribbage,</HI> Plebeians are not confined to low Life a|lone; the great World has its Vulgar too, I a&s;&s;ure you. The Difference does not lie in the Richne&s;s; I have &s;een an A&s;s cloath|ed in a very gorgeous Sumpter-Cloth. The true Di&s;tinction lies in wearing the Qualities of the Mind on the outward
<PB N="280" REF="281">Habit, in the Peculiarity of Fancy and E|legance of Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip might &s;urely have added, &s;aid Mi&s;s <HI>Trinket,</HI> that <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> is a Hand|maid to Beauty too; it &s;erves to adorn and embelli&s;h Nature with Art, and to make what was lovely &s;till more attracting. However brilliant a Diamond may be in it&s;elf, it wants of its Value and Lu&s;tre, till &s;uitably &s;et; there may be an Elegance to be &s;ure in the Manner of &s;etting, but &s;till it ought to be ca&s;ed in nothing but Gold.</P>
<P>I greatly Iament the Departure of Mrs. <HI>Philligree,</HI> &s;aid Lord <HI>Mansfield,</HI> it is &s;he who would have adorned your Ornaments, Ladies; and have dre&s;&s;ed out <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> it&s;elf, in a &s;umptuous Outr&egrave; of Terms, and new Cut of Phra&s;e. I agree indeed with the Counte&s;s, that &s;ome Tokens or Markings, &s;uch as tho&s;e that <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> &s;upplies, are re|qui&s;ite for di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;everal Or|ders and Subordinations of People in a Community; but I am &s;orry to find that the&s;e &s;ame Markings or Tokens &s;hould, very nearly, engro&s;s the whole of the Things intended to be &s;ignified. If you take the full-bottomed Wig from a Judge, what will become of his Wi&s;dom? or Lawn and Sattin from Bi&s;hops, what would become of their Sanctity? or, &s;hould Mo|narchs be deprived of their Crowns and
<PB N="281" REF="282">Regalia, I doubt it would be a fearful A|bridgment of Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>I al&s;o agree with Lady <HI>Cribbage</HI> that the Qualities of the Mind are worn on the out|ward Habit. But, pray ye, what Sort of internal Qualities do tho&s;e external Ha|bits exhibit? even every Species of Af|fectation, Folly and Vanity that is con|ceivable. The whole futile Soul of a Fe|male &s;eems to have for&s;aken its frail Man|&s;ion and to float upon the Surface of her Attire. In the long Labours of the Toi|lette, where &s;o much Pains, Time, and Trea&s;ure is expended on an elaborate Ex|ternity, does not a Woman as good as confe&s;s that the whole of her Value lies where the whole of her Care is be&s;towed?</P>
<P>Now, in all the&s;e Operations, Female Vanity propo&s;es to excite the &s;ame Sen&s;a|tions in others, that it feels in and for it|&s;elf, on the plea&s;ing Contemplation of its own Image. Ah mi&s;deeming and pitiable Objects! while ye pa&s;s along, or &s;it exalt|ed in your imaginary Pre-eminence, &s;ome of your Sex behold you with an Eye of Contempt, others with an Eye of Envy, and all with an Eye of Malevolence, in|qui&s;itive after your Mi&s;carriages, and de|&s;irous of publi&s;hing and magnifying the &s;malle&s;t of your Failings.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="283">
Men, indeed, behold you with an Eye of Plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they draw an Inference from your Vanity that flatters their own. They contemplate you as dre&s;&s;ing at them. They con&s;ider the Labours of your Toi|lette as a Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>de&s;iring to be de&s;ired;</HI> as an Advance on your Part, and a Kind of Challenge for them to approach and capi|tulate.</P>
<P>I own that Beauty, as Mi&s;s <HI>Trinket</HI> has ob&s;erved, may occa&s;ionally derive a Sort of Acce&s;&s;ion from <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> like a Diamond en|ca&s;ed in precious Metal. But how much more generally do we ob&s;erve conceited Ugline&s;s and Deformity deriving addition|al Darkne&s;s from the Lu&s;tre that &s;urrounds it, like a Turnip or Toad&s;tool encircled by Gems.</P>
<P>Whether Finery gives additional Force to the Magnet of Beauty, for exciting and drawing our Affections to it, is an Article of which I am much in doubt. What &s;ay you to this Que&s;tion, Mr. <HI>Fenton?</HI></P>
<P>I hold, my Lord, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> that Finery is merely a <HI>Narci&s;&s;us,</HI> that neither loves nor is beloved by any except it&s;elf. It is much to be que&s;tioned whether Belle or Beau ever engaged the Affections of any &s;en&s;ible Per&s;on of the oppo&s;ite Sex; and,
<PB N="283" REF="284">where they them&s;elves have been &s;u&s;cepti|ble of the delicate Pa&s;&s;ion, they from that Moment cea&s;ed to be Belles or Beaus. <HI>Paris</HI> is the only Beau, as I remember, that ever was capable of loving a Wo|man; and yet, as you all know, &s;he was not a dre&s;&s;ed Lady to whom he gave the Prize.</P>
<P>Dame <HI>Iris</HI> was the greate&s;t Belle in all the Heaven of Pagan Theology. She was, as we may &s;ay, the female <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed out in her gay Coat of many Colours; and yet we do not find that &s;he ever at|tracted the love of a &s;ingle Immortal, or even Mortal, though &s;he duly and daily Vi&s;its them in all her Finery, and fails not to &s;hed Showers of Tears at their Di&s;dain.</P>
<P>Finery may dazzle, it may awe, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly excite the &s;malle&s;t Pittance of Affection. This can alone be done by &s;omething more per&s;onal, by &s;omething le&s;s &s;uperficial. Even the <HI>&s;implex Mundi|ties,</HI> that Ornament of a clean Simplicity, recommended by <HI>Horace,</HI> can operate only by Intimation of deeper Purity. The Vir|tues alone can weave the truly enchanting Robe of Female Influence, and the Graces alone gird on the <HI>Cae&s;tus</HI> or Girdle of ir|re&s;i&s;table Beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285">
Among the infinite Variety of Female Fa&s;hions, which in Turns have been fan|ta&s;tically predominant upon Earth, I re|member but of one &s;o very ob&s;olete as not to have revived in &s;ome di&s;tant Age or Climate. That the Memory of this &s;ame Fa&s;hion &s;hould not be wholly lo&s;t, it is re|corded by Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy.</HI> Here he recommends it to the Ladies to <HI>adorn them&s;elves with Sobriety and Shamefacedne&s;s, not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or co&s;tly Array.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Paul</HI> however, in this Piece of Advice, appears to have &s;pread a Net for the Hearts of his own Sex. The haughty, reluctant, and &s;tubborn Spirit of Man, can reject Wealth and Titles, can look with Indifference on the Symmetry of Shape and Features, and guard it&s;elf again&s;t the At|tacks of Female Artifice; but Female Ba&s;hfulne&s;s is an uncon&s;cious Thief to whom the Doors of all Hearts are in&s;tant|ly thrown open.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Maid who would atchieve the whole Laurel of Conque&s;t, mu&s;t not be obvious or obtru&s;ive; like <HI>Daphne,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t fly though pur&s;ued by an <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Company, breaking up, gave di&s;tinct and pre&s;&s;ing Invitations to Mr.
<PB N="285" REF="286"><HI>Fenton;</HI> but he politely excu&s;ed his Atten|dance for the pre&s;ent, on Account of a Multiplicity of indi&s;pen&s;able Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>On the following Morning, as he &s;at in his Study, &s;ome one tapped at the Door, and, on his de&s;iring them to walk in, who &s;hould enter but Lady <HI>Maitland</HI> in an a|greeable Di&s;habille.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;aid &s;he (deeply blu&s;hing and he&s;itating) I, I, &mdash; you mu&s;t think it very odd &mdash; I &s;ay, Sir, I &s;hould not have intruded upon you, thus out of all Form; perhaps indecently un&s;ea&s;onable. &mdash; Plea&s;e to be &s;eated, Madam. &mdash; The Bu&s;ine&s;s I come upon, Sir, is &s;o very intere&s;ting, &s;o concerning to my Peace, that I could not refu&s;e my&s;elf this Oppor|tunity of breaking in upon you. &mdash; Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear Madam, that the great|e&s;t Plea&s;ure you can do me is to let me know, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, wherein I can &s;erve you.</P>
<P>Here the Counte&s;s, looking eagerly and inqui&s;itively on him, put her Hand in her Bo&s;om, took out a Picture, and alternately &s;urveying the one and the other, yes, &s;he cried, it is, it mu&s;t certainly be &s;o. Then, reaching out the Picture, can you tell me Sir, &s;aid &s;he, for whom this was drawn,
<PB N="286" REF="287">or rather do you remember to whom you gave it?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> took the Picture, looked at it, and &s;tarted; when, recollecting Ideas and Pa&s;&s;ages, as from afar off; good God! he exclaimed, is it po&s;&s;ible, can you be my little <HI>Fanny Goodall?</HI> yes, my deare&s;t Cou&s;in, an&s;wered the Counte&s;s, as &s;urely as you are the &s;till too amiable <HI>Harry Clinton.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon they both ro&s;e &s;uddenly, and Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> catching his quondam <HI>Fanny</HI> in his Arms, pre&s;&s;ed her to his Bo&s;om with warm and kindred Affection. But the Agitation of the Counte&s;s was too big for Utterance, till, re&s;uming her Chair, &s;he gave Scope to her Pa&s;&s;ion, and bur&s;t into a violent Flood of Tears.</P>
<P>After a mutual and affecting Silence; ah! cries Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> in a Voice expre&s;&s;ive of much Emotion, how am I, my lovely Cou&s;in, to interpret the&s;e Tears? am I to con&s;ider them as further Proofs of your ancient Aver&s;ion to me, or as kindly and dear In&s;tances of your returning Affection? &mdash; The Counte&s;s an&s;wered not; and Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> continued.</P>
<P>You may remember, my Cou&s;in, that I had very few Relations. My only Brother
<PB N="287" REF="288">ever continued to behave him&s;elf toward me as an Alien and an Enemy; and my only Uncle and Guardian who, in his later Years, became your Father, was no way agreeable to my Ta&s;te or Di&s;po&s;ition. In you therefore, from your Infancy, in you alone, my amiable Cou&s;in, I had centred all my Sen&s;ations of Fatherhood, Brother|hood, all the Affections and tender Feel|ings that naturally ari&s;e from Kindred and Con&s;anguinity. How have I been delight|ed with your infantine Prattle, how have I exulted in your opening Charms! on the Death of my fir&s;t Wife you were my only Con&s;olation; and, in your innocent Care&s;&s;es and attractive Endearments, I felt a &s;weet|ne&s;s of Emotion that I never felt before.</P>
<P>On my Return from <HI>France,</HI> with what Tran&s;ports did you receive me! we grew as it were, in our Embracements, to each other. You were then, as I apprehend, about ten Years of Age. But, on my next Vi&s;it, you refu&s;ed to be &s;een by me. Soon after, you were taken ill. I daily went with an aching Heart to enquire after your Health, but your Mamma perempto|rily refu&s;ed me Admi&s;&s;ion to your Pre|&s;ence, till, on your Recovery, you were conveyed from me, and &s;ecreted into the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
Though this Unkindne&s;s went near my Heart, it did not alter my Affections, I &s;till continued to enquire after you, I &s;till continued to be intere&s;ted in you, and I preferred my ardent Wi&s;hes and Prayers to Heaven for your Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Maitland,</HI> (you have unque&s;tionably your Rea&s;ons for chu&s;ing to be &s;o called) I am very &s;en&s;ible Sir, I &s;ay, of your extraordinary Partiality to me from my earlie&s;t Years. Your Ten|derne&s;s, as you mentioned, was that of the fonde&s;t of Fathers or Brothers. You knew the Degree and Kind of Affection that was &s;uitable between &s;uch Relations, and you kept your&s;elf preci&s;ely within the Limits. But alas! for my Part, I knew no &s;uch Di&s;tinctions. I was as a Piece of Virgin Wax, warmed and willingly yielding to the fir&s;t kindly Impre&s;&s;ion. You made that Impre&s;&s;ion, my Cou&s;in, you made it deep and entire. As I had but the one Heart, &s;o I had but the one Love, and that Love was all your own without Di&s;tinction or Degree.</P>
<P>Gracious Heaven, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> what is this you tell me, Madam? is it po&s;&s;ible that, at your Years, you &s;hould actually conceive a Pa&s;&s;ion for one who
<PB N="289" REF="290">might almo&s;t have been your Grandfather? ah, if that be the Ca&s;e, what have I not to an&s;wer, for indulging you and my&s;elf in tho&s;e innocent Care&s;&s;es which, at that Time, fondly con&s;tituted the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Sen&s;ations of my Life.</P>
<P>Alas, replied the Counte&s;s, if you have any Thing to an&s;wer for, on that Account, the Charge indeed is very weighty which I have to bring again&s;t you.</P>
<P>I was not eight Years old when I begg|ed this Picture from you, which you ge|nerou&s;ly enriched with this Circlet of Dia|monds. Soon after, you went to <HI>France</HI> and, during your Ab&s;ence, this Picture was my con&s;tant Companion, whom I ca|re&s;&s;ed, whom I talked to, and to whom alone I made my Complaints in all my lit|tle Matters of Grievance.</P>
<P>I know not by what In&s;tinct or Kind of Cunning it was, that I endeavoured to conceal my Affection for this your Re&s;em|blance, and never made my Court to it but when I was alone.</P>
<P>The Morning after your Vi&s;it, on your Return from <HI>Paris,</HI> as I was carele&s;sly per|forming the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my little Toilette before the Gla&s;s; I took out your Picture, and &s;urveyed it with new and encrea&s;ing
<PB N="290" REF="291">Delight. In the mean Time I did not know that my Mama &s;tood behind me, attentive to all my Motions that were re|flected to her by the Mirror. She heard me talk to your Picture, &s;he &s;aw me ki&s;s it and eagerly pre&s;s it to my Bo&s;om. At la&s;t I turned my Eye to the Gla&s;s, and perceived a Piece of her Image, whereon I &s;tarted, coloured, and trembled, and was thrown, I know not why, into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ah <HI>Fanny,</HI> cried my Mother, what is this that I &s;ee? your young Heart, my Child, is certainly affected. Unque&s;tion|ably you love your Cou&s;in <HI>Clinton.</HI></P>
<P>Ought I not to love him, Madam, does he not love me as well as I love him? No no, my Darling, &s;aid my Mother, I would to Heaven that he did. Your Cou&s;in <HI>Clin|ton</HI> indeed is worthy of all Love, but then he has lately given away his Heart to ano|ther. He is married, my <HI>Fanny.</HI>&mdash;And can't he love me &s;till, for all that, Madam?&mdash;By no Means, my &s;weet Innocent. When once a Man marries, he vows and &s;wears, and obliges him&s;elf to love nobody living but his Wife; and what is more, my <HI>Fanny,</HI> it is accounted very naughty in any Girl to think of lov|ing &s;uch a one afterward.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292">
What Emotions did I then feel, what a Conflict of oppo&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ions! but Re|&s;entment, for the Time, got the upper Hand. I had yet formed no Idea of the Relations of Sex, or Matrimony, or any conjugal Obligation, &s;ave that of Love a|lone. But then it was &s;ufficient to me that I had given you my whole Heart, that nothing le&s;s than your whole Heart could &s;atisfy me in return; and I felt my&s;elf offended and outraged to the la&s;t Degree, by your having imparted a Share thereof to another.</P>
<P>The Day following, as I &s;at, languid and much di&s;compo&s;ed, as well by my Pa&s;&s;ion as want of Re&s;t the Night before; my Mama came up to tell me that you were below and enquired for me. No, no, my deare&s;t Mama, &s;aid I, it doesn't &s;ig|nify, I will not &s;ee him. Let him go to whomever he loves be&s;t.&mdash;But, what &s;hall I &s;ay to him, my <HI>Fanny,</HI> what Ex|cu&s;e &s;hall I make&mdash;No Matter for Excu&s;es, Madam, tell him that I never de&s;ire to &s;ee his Face any more.</P>
<P>As &s;omething informed me that you could not help &s;till loving me a little, I laid hold of that little Love to pique, and di&s;oblige, and be revenged of you for your
<PB N="292" REF="293">Perfidy; and as long as you &s;taid, the Thoughts of the Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s I pre&s;umed you were under gave me va&s;t Delight. But, as &s;oon as I was told you were gone, my Heart &s;unk down, as from a Mount of Triumph into a Depth of De|&s;olation.</P>
<P>My Mama came up to con&s;ole me. She highly applauded my Spirit and the Re|&s;entment I had &s;hewed; and &s;he blamed you for marrying another, at a Time that you pretended &s;o much Fondne&s;s to me. She further endeavoured to &s;et me again&s;t your Age. She told me that you mu&s;t &s;oon be old and ugly and wrinkled, and that you was much fitter to be my Father than my Lover. She al&s;o &s;poke to me of my va&s;t Fortune, of my Beauty and &s;o|forth; and that I might have my pick and choice of all the young and hand&s;ome Earls and Dukes in the Nation. She open|ed to me, in a Variety of glittering Pro|&s;pects, all the Plea&s;ures and Advantages of Wealth, Title, State, Equipage, with the Re&s;pect and Admiration of Crowds bend|ing around me. As &s;he repre&s;ented them to my Imagination, I catched at each of them for Comfort; but alas, I did not find you among them, and all to me became empty.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">
That Night, my tender Mama for&s;ook her own Bed and came to lie in mine. I &s;aw that &s;he had been afflicted; &s;o, for fear of adding to her Trouble, I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my own Emotions, and pretending to be a&s;leep, I lay quiet by her Side, till toward Morning, when I was &s;eized with a violent Fever. During my Illne&s;s I was told that you came daily to enquire about me; and that, I believe, above all Things contri|buted to my Recovery. One Day, my Mama came and informed me that you &s;at below in Tears, and earne&s;tly reque&s;t|ed to be permitted to &s;ee me. O, how &s;weet and comforting did tho&s;e Tears &s;eem to drop upon my Heart; but, mu&s;tering all my little Pride and remaining Dignity, no, no, my Mama, I cried, I will die fir&s;t! if he doesn't fir&s;t unmarry him&s;elf I will never &s;ee him any more.</P>
<P>When I had gotten Strength enough to walk about the Chamber, my Mama and I being alone, I went to my Drawer; and taking out your Picture, and turning my Head a&s;ide, I reached it to her, &s;aying, here Madam, take this and lock it up from me; for while I love it and hate it &s;o much, it Troubles me to look at it. My Mama thereupon took it from me, and catched me to her Bo&s;om, but, without
<PB N="294" REF="295">&s;aying a Word, &s;he bur&s;t into Tears and &s;traight quitted the Room.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was judged that I was able to travel, my Parents, by the Ad|vice of their Doctors, took me far into the Country. My Mother, in the mean Time, had unque&s;tionably confided my Secret to my Father; for, though he was naturally of a &s;evere and backward Temper, he be|came extremely tender and indulgent to|ward me.</P>
<P>As I was the only Child they ever had, their whole Care and Solicitude was af|fectionately employed in procuring me a Variety of Gratifications and Amu&s;ements. When I was in Spirits, they were in a Kind of Triumph; but my Dejection was to them the mo&s;t grievous of all Oppre&s;|&s;ions. They took down my <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;|tre&s;s and Mu&s;ic Ma&s;ter with them; and they collected from all Parts the mo&s;t a|greeable &s;et of Mi&s;&s;es and Ma&s;ters that they could mu&s;ter; &s;o that my Time was portioned out the mo&s;t happily that could be between Bu&s;ine&s;s and Recreations that were equally plea&s;ing. They had taken Care that your Name &s;hould never be men|tioned before me; and though, at Times, my Soul was athir&s;t and my Ear opened and turned to hear Tidings concerning you, yet a certain native Ba&s;hfulne&s;s and
<PB N="295" REF="296">fear of offending again&s;t Decency, did not permit me to enquire after you.</P>
<P>Thus a Length of Ab&s;ence, and a Va|riety of Di&s;&s;ipations by Degrees greatly abated the Ardour of my Pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;o|much that I did not &s;eem to feel any more for you. When any Occa&s;ion, however, renewed in me the Impre&s;&s;ion of former Scenes, a thrilling Sort of Chilne&s;s would run through my Blood. And, at other Times, when alone and thinking of you, a &s;wimming kind of Stupor would fall &s;adly upon my Soul.</P>
<P>On our Return to <HI>London</HI> after five Years Ab&s;ence, the great Number of Peo|ple, with the Novelty and Variety of Ob|jects that crowded upon my View, amu&s;ed and engaged my whole Attention. But, when we enter'd the old Man&s;ion; when I turned my Eyes on the Places where you &s;at, where you walked, where you talked and u&s;ed to care&s;s me, you became as it were actually vi&s;ible to my Eyes; &s;omething &s;eemed to wring my Heart, and I was &s;eized with a Sickne&s;s near to Faint|ing. I took hold of my Maid by the Arm, and with her Help walked into the Garden for fre&s;h Air; but there too you had got before me, on the Terrace, in the Walks and Alleys, where you u&s;ed to run feigned Races with me, and to gather
<PB N="296" REF="297">Fruit for me, and to play with me at bob Cherry, and afterward to pre&s;s the Lips that had gained the Prize. I then turned away from a Place that afforded me no A&s;ylum from you. My Mother met and eagerly a&s;ked what ailed me; let us go, Mama, I cried, let us go &s;ome where el&s;e, I am not able to &s;tay in this Place any longer. Accordingly, that very Evening we removed to Lodgings; and, in a few Days, my Dada took and furni&s;hed a new Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell, my dear Sir, on a trivial Detail of the many Circum&s;tances and little Incidents that happened during the Space of four &s;ucceeding Years. An Infinity of Suitors paid their Addre&s;&s;es to me or my Fortune, I neither knew nor cared to which, for I continued alike in|&s;en&s;ible to all. It is true that during &s;uch a Number of Years, having neither &s;een nor heard from you, I dropt all Thoughts of you, and &s;carce retained the Traces or Lineaments of your Per&s;on or A&s;pect. From the Impre&s;&s;ion however which you left in my Mind, I had formed to my&s;elf a dear though confu&s;ed Image of the Love|ly, of the De&s;irable, and this I looked for every where, but could no where find any Re&s;emblance thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="298">
In the mean Time my Parents urged me &s;trongly to Matrimony. They affect|ingly repre&s;ented that they &s;hould not die in Peace, if I did not afford them the Pro&s;pect of perpetuating them&s;elves in my Offspring: &s;uch is the fond Succeda|neum which &s;hort lived Creatures propo&s;e for eking out their Exi&s;tence, and &s;upply|ing the Lot of an inevitable Mortality by the flattering though poor Sub&s;titute of a Name, or bare Remembrance.</P>
<P>At length I told my Parents that, as I could not form any Choice of my own, I would tru&s;t wholly to their Judgment, and take up with whom&s;oever they &s;hould be plea&s;ed to appoint. Hereupon they re|commended the Earl of <HI>Maitland</HI> to me. I kept to my Promi&s;e, and we were con|&s;equently married.</P>
<P>My Hu&s;band was comely in his Per&s;on, ea&s;y and affable in his Temper, and a Man of &s;ingular Sen&s;e and Letters for a Lord. He loved me with Pa&s;&s;ion, and, as I could not pay him in Specie, I endea|voured to &s;upply my want of Affection to him by my Attention and A&s;&s;iduities.</P>
<P>On the fifth Year of my Marriage my Father died of a good old Age; and in four Years more my deare&s;t Mother left
<PB N="298" REF="299">me de&s;olate. In her I lo&s;t the only Object of fond Affections that I had upon Earth, and my Looks tacitly reproached my Hu&s;|band for his want of Power to con&s;ole me.</P>
<P>I believe it was equally unhappy for my Lord, as my&s;elf, that we were not ble&s;&s;ed with Children. The dear and tender At|tachments, that bind Parents to their Off|&s;pring, &s;erve al&s;o as a &s;ub&s;equent and more affecting nuptial Band for uniting tho&s;e Parents more intimately to each other. It draws about them a new Circle of In|tere&s;ts and Amities; and, by creating a mutual Confidence, forbids the Intru&s;ion of tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies that mu&s;t at all Times pre&s;uppo&s;e an Alienation of Regard. This however was not the Ca&s;e between Lord <HI>Maitland</HI> and me. We never had a Child. Perhaps, in &s;ome Con&s;titutions, a Union of Souls as well as Per&s;ons may be requi&s;ite for &s;uch an Effect.</P>
<P>During the two Years &s;ucceeding the Death of my dear Mother, I conceived a Di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t Company and Entertain|ments. I took a religious Turn. I look|ed upon this World and all that it con|tained as quite unworthy the Regard of an immortal Being. The principal Part of my Time was taken up in Books and Offices of Devotion; in which Employ|ment I alternately &s;unk under the mo&s;t
<PB N="299" REF="300">gloomy Depre&s;&s;ion of Spirits, and again was elevated above my&s;elf into a new World of Joys and inexpre&s;&s;ible Openings.</P>
<P>At length I was taken exceeding ill of what the Phy&s;icians called a Fever upon the Nerves, which confined me to my Bed above &s;ix Weeks. During my Illne&s;s, my Hu&s;band was the mo&s;t con&s;tant and a&s;&s;iduous of all my Attendants. The af|fectionate Sadne&s;s, the painful Di&s;tre&s;s, the tender Solicitude, that was vi&s;ible in all his Looks and Actions, made way into my Soul with an obliging Impre&s;&s;ion; and, while I reproached my&s;elf for my ungrateful De|fect of Sen&s;ibility toward him, Love, or &s;omething tender and very like to Love took Place in my Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was on the Recovery, my Hu&s;band di&s;appeared without taking Leave or giving me any Notice; and for three Weeks I knew not what was become of him. At length he returned, pale and greatly emaciated. I had yet lo&s;t none of the Tenderne&s;s which I conceived for him during my Illne&s;s. I took him affection|ately by the Hand, which glowed like a Coal of Fire. Ah, I cried, where have you been, what Looks are the&s;e, my Lord, what is the meaning of all this? he an|&s;wered not, but withdrawing his Hand, and &s;carce deigning to look toward me; I
<PB N="300" REF="301">am not well, he faintly &s;aid, I mu&s;t go to my Bed.</P>
<P>While his Servants undre&s;&s;ed him, I &s;tood in &s;ilent A&s;toni&s;hment, vainly gue&s;&s;|ing at the Cau&s;e of this extraordinary Be|haviour; but, as &s;oon as he had lain down, I took a Seat by his Side, and, &s;eizing and pre&s;&s;ing one of his Hands between mine, I broke into Tears.</P>
<P>After a &s;ad and mutual Silence, ah Ma|dam, cried my Hu&s;band, what am I to under&s;tand by the&s;e Tears? I am willing to con&s;ider them as Proofs of your Huma|nity, but I cannot con&s;ider them as In|&s;tances of your Affection. You love me not, Madam; you never did love me. All the Con&s;tancy and Complacence of the mo&s;t ardent Pa&s;&s;ion, all my Endeavours and A&s;&s;iduities have not been able to pro|cure me the &s;malle&s;t Intere&s;t in your Heart. I blame you not, Madam; alas! we are not the Ma&s;ters of own Affections. I am &s;en&s;ible that I never de&s;erved your Love. That was a Ble&s;&s;ing re&s;erved for a more amiable Object. But then the Tender|ne&s;s and Truth of my Attachment to you might &s;urely have laid Claim to a Share of your Confidence. Ah, how precious had &s;uch a Confidence been to my Heart! it had &s;tood to me in the Place of your
<PB N="301" REF="302">Love, and I &s;hould not have reproached you for irre&s;i&s;table Propen&s;ities. Yes, Ma|dam, I &s;ay irre&s;i&s;table, for I know you are virtuous. Perhaps it was not in your Power to refu&s;e another your Love, but then you might have admitted your Hu&s;|band to a Share of your Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>You have my Friend&s;hip, I cried, my tendere&s;t Friend&s;hip, my mo&s;t affectionate Regards. If my Love is not &s;o ardent as you could wi&s;h, you however have all the Love of which I am capable, and you po&s;|&s;e&s;s it entire and undivided.</P>
<P>What is this you tell me, Madam? I would to Heaven you could &s;till deceive me, that I had &s;till continued in Igno|rance! but that is pa&s;t, it is over, Ma|dam, my Eyes are opened to my Wretch|edne&s;s; and I die in the double Want of your Faith and your Affection. I have &s;een your Lover, Lady; I &s;aw him four Days ago from an oppo&s;ite Window. He &s;tood before this Hou&s;e, in Conver&s;e with another. I expected every Moment, that taking Advantage of my Ab&s;ence, he would have gained Admi&s;&s;ion to you. I held my Sword ready to follow, to pierce his Heart, and &s;acrifice him to the Claims of my Ho|nour and my Love. But, he &s;uddenly di&s;appeared and di&s;appointed my Ven|geance.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="303">
Gracious Heaven, I exclaimed, what Madne&s;s is this? do you dream, or who is it that has thus cruelly impo&s;ed upon you? you &s;hall &s;ee the Impo&s;tor, Madam, replied my Lord. So &s;aying, he &s;uddenly put his Hand back, and taking your Pic|ture from under the Pillow, he indignantly demanded, do you know the Original of this Portrait, Lady? ah, I &s;creamed, I confe&s;s it, I do know him, I did know him indeed; he was the Idol of my Heart, I delighted in him, I doated upon him! you then acknowledge, you avow it, re|joined my Hu&s;band, and at length you deign to make me the Confident of a Pa&s;|&s;ion which I &s;uppo&s;e, in your Favour, to have been involuntary. Ah, had I been earlier appri&s;ed of my Unhappine&s;s, I might not have &s;unk under the unexpected and &s;udden Pre&s;&s;ure as I do at this Day. But &s;ay, who and what is this formidable Rival, who robs me of my Peace, who tears my Life from me?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t tell me, my Lord, &s;aid I, how you came by this Picture? I found it in your Cabinet during your Illne&s;s, &s;aid he, when I &s;earched for your E&s;&s;ences to relieve you from a fainting Fit. I flatter my&s;elf that I am not of a jealous Di&s;po&s;ition. Curio&s;ity fir&s;t incited me to hurry it into
<PB N="303" REF="304">my Pocket. I afterwards &s;urveyed it more at Lei&s;ure, and &s;ome &s;tarting Doubts aro&s;e. I endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s them; I argued with my&s;elf that it might be a Family-Picture, the Repre&s;entative of a Brother or dear Relation decea&s;ed. But then &s;ome Enemy of my Peace again whi&s;pered to my Spirit that, if this had been the Ca&s;e, you would not be &s;o &s;olicitous to conceal it from me; you would rather have boa&s;t|ed of &s;uch an Ornament of your Lineage; you would have been proud to exhibit it before all People. This &s;taggered me I confe&s;s; and additional Doubts and Sug|ge&s;tions were impelled upon my Soul. She re&s;erves this, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, for her own Eye and In&s;pection; to revi&s;e it, to gaze and dwell upon it in Secret; and to plea&s;e her Sight with the favourite Image that is impre&s;&s;ed upon her Heart. At each of the&s;e Reflections I felt a Sting in my Bo&s;om; and the more I revolved and debated on the&s;e Uncertainties, the great|er Strength they gained and drew nearer to Demon&s;tration. Ah, I cried, her real Coldne&s;s and feigned Regards are now equally accounted for. She deceives me, &s;he impo&s;es upon me; and I will counter|feit in my Turn till this My&s;tery is detect|ed. I then attempted and would have con&s;trained my&s;elf to look at you with my accu&s;tomed Tenderne&s;s; but I found it im|po&s;&s;ible. I therefore withdrew &s;uddenly
<PB N="304" REF="305">and without any Notice. If &s;he ever had a Tincture of Friend&s;hip for me, thought I, the Apprehen&s;ion of my Lo&s;s will a|wake in her a Sen&s;e thereof. I di&s;gui&s;ed my&s;elf, and, as a Stranger, took Lodgings over again&s;t you. I took my Station at the Window. I was on the watch from Morn till Noon, to make a thorough In|qui&s;ition into your Conduct during my Ab&s;ence. I &s;hall di&s;cover her Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;aid I, by the Vi&s;itants whom &s;he receives; but, during a Fortnight of Ob&s;ervation, I could not perceive that, of the Numbers who called, any one was admitted. My jealous Pa&s;&s;ions abated; and I began to re|proach my&s;elf for having ever conceived them; when, to my utter Confu&s;ion, there &s;tood full to my View, in Dre&s;s, A&s;pect, Mien, Attitude, the di&s;tingui&s;hed Origi|nal of the Portrait which I had in my Pocket.</P>
<P>Here, I pa&s;&s;ionately broke in upon my Hu&s;band's Narration. God be prai&s;ed, I exclaimed; he then lives, he &s;till lives, my mo&s;t dear and amiable Cou&s;in, though I never wi&s;h to behold his Face any more! my only Relation, perhaps now my only Friend, you are &s;till living, and I tru&s;t you are happy; and that is e|nough!</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">
Your Relation, your only Relation, Ma|dam, cried my Lord! is he &s;o near? is he no nearer, no dearer to you than Con|&s;anguinity will warrant? proceed my Lord, I &s;aid, I will then tell you all, without Di&s;gui&s;e or Palliation.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to you, an&s;wered my Hu&s;band, that the Sight of him &s;truck my Soul with the fulle&s;t Conviction of my being betrayed. My jealous Pangs returned with double Poignancy. I was enkindled, I was &s;et on Fire, my Heart was rent &s;eve|ral Ways. A violent Fever &s;eized upon me, but my Fury and thir&s;t of Ven|geance &s;upported me under it. For four Days longer I held up in the impatient Expectation of once more beholding your Lover, that I might pierce him in a thou|&s;and Places, in every &s;educing Part about him. But Nature at length gave way, I &s;unk under the Oppre&s;&s;ion; and I return|ed, once for all, to behold, to reproach, and to expire before you.</P>
<P>O, my Hu&s;band, my Friend, my true Lover, I cried, how I pity, how I feel for you! I excu&s;e your Su&s;picions however in|jurious to my Honour, &s;ince your Jea|lou&s;y perhaps is not wholly without Foun|dation. I did indeed love the Per&s;on, for whom that Portrait was drawn, with Ten|derne&s;s,
<PB N="306" REF="307">with Pa&s;&s;ion. But believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you that I have not &s;et my Eyes, either on the Original or Picture, the&s;e twenty Years.</P>
<P>What is this you tell me? exclaimed my Lord. You are not yet, as I take it, thirty Years of Age. Could you love, even to Pa&s;&s;ion, at &s;o very early a Pe|riod?</P>
<P>Here I found my&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;covering to my Hu&s;band the little Adventures, Impre&s;&s;ions, and Sentiments of my Infancy, wherewith you are al|ready acquainted. When I had fini&s;hed my &s;hort Narrative, he &s;eized my Hand, and pre&s;&s;ing it pa&s;&s;ionatly to his Lips, and then to his burning Bo&s;om, he melted into Tears. O, my <HI>Fanny,</HI> he cried, my mo&s;t noble, my adorable Creature! what a Combat have you fought, what a Con|que&s;t have you gained, of Grace over Na|ture, of Virtue again&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion! can you excu&s;e me, will you forgive me? may I hope that you will re&s;tore me to the ble&s;&s;|ings of your Friend&s;hip? May I flatter my&s;elf that you gave me as much as you could of your Affections? that, if you had been able, you would have loved me with a Love like mine?</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="308">
I will not di&s;tre&s;s you, my Cou&s;in, by a De&s;cription of the affecting Scenes that en&s;ued. My Hu&s;band left me va&s;tly rich, but &s;till more forlorn. During the fir&s;t Years of my Widowhood, I looked upon my&s;elf as a friendle&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary Bur|den upon Earth. Though I thought of you at Times, it was not without a Re|&s;entment and a Tincture of Aver&s;ion, for your never having deigned to enquire or find out, whether any &s;uch Per&s;on, as your too affectionate <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> was in the Land of the Living. At length my Phy|&s;icians and my Friends, (as they &s;tiled them&s;elves) prevailed upon me once more, to enter into the Light and Air and A|mu&s;ements of their World. I con&s;ented. I found my Advantage in it. I gradually got rid of the grievous Oppre&s;&s;ion that lay upon my Spirits. Since all is Vanity, thought I, let us partake of the Di&s;&s;ipation, and make it as plea&s;ing as we can; and accordingly you found me in the Engage|ments which you honoured with your In|&s;pection Ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>When you entered, I did not know you. The &s;trange Name of <HI>Fenton,</HI> as well as the Alteration which Years had made in you, &s;hut you out almo&s;t wholly from my Recollection. I felt my&s;elf however agi|tated I knew not why. Something in your
<PB N="308" REF="309">Per&s;on and Manner renewed, in my Heart, Impre&s;&s;ions kindred to tho&s;e which were once its &s;ole Concern. I could not look at you, I could not &s;peak to you without E|motion. All Night I lay di&s;turbed, in vain endeavouring to remember when or where I had &s;een you. At Morning a &s;udden Light darted in upon my Mind. I got up, and flew to your Picture which, at once, laid all open and detected your Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>You are much altered Cou&s;in. Had I fir&s;t &s;een you as you now appear, I think my young Heart would not have been &s;o deeply affected. The Ruin however is &s;till very noble, and endearingly renews in me the Idea of what the Building once was.</P>
<P>Your ab&s;tracted Air, and the change of your Name &s;eem to intimate &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing Situation. But, if fifty thou&s;and Pounds, or that Sum doubled will be of U&s;e to you, I &s;hall for once think that Fortune has been of Advantage to me.</P>
<P>My mo&s;t dear and generous Cou&s;in, re|plied Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> I &s;hall never pardon my|&s;elf tho&s;e Griefs which the Exce&s;s of my Affection inadvertently occa&s;ioned you. No Brother ever loved a Si&s;ter, no Parent a Child, with fonder Pa&s;&s;ion. The Aver|&s;ion, which I thought you had &s;uddenly taken to me, was one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="309" REF="310">Afflictions of my Life; and my Ignorance of what laterally became of you, can only be accounted for by an Ab&s;tract of my own Story.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> called for Chocolate. And, after Breakfa&s;t, he gave Lady <HI>Mait|land</HI> the following affecting Hi&s;tory of his own Life and Adventures.</P>
