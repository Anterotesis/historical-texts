<HEAD><HI>TO DR.</HI> THOMAS DENMAN.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now above three years &s;ince Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> publi&s;hed a de&s;crip|tion of his <HI>New Forceps with three Blades,</HI> together with an elegant Copper-plate Print of that In&s;trument. From this Publication, though attended with con&s;iderable expence, he derived no advantage, &s;ince it was chiefly intended as a compliment to his <HI>Pupils,</HI> and to &s;uch other Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion as were par|ticularly engaged in the province of <HI>Midwifery.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is true, when his <HI>Introductory Lecture</HI> was lately publi&s;hed, his paper on the <HI>Forceps</HI> was annexed to it, but without being mentioned in the Adverti&s;ement, or making any addition to the price.</NOTE> Of this I can &s;peak with confidence, as I had at that time the plea&s;ure of attending the Doctor's Lectures, and was therefore, well acquainted with the truth of the particulars which I now mention. I was likewi&s;e one of the many, who, from the principles on which it was recom|mended, thought this a valuable addition to the Apparatus of Mid|wifery; nor has my experience of its u&s;e in Practice hitherto failed to confirm this opinion. But the merit of Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s <HI>Forceps</HI> re&s;ts on a much better foundation than any thing I can pretend to ad|vance in its favour. Many of the be&s;t Accoucheurs, both at home and abroad, have been plea&s;ed to commend it as a con&s;iderable Im|provement; many Commi&s;&s;ions were &s;oon received by the In&s;tru|ment-Makers, for &s;ending it to different quarters; and to my cer|tain knowledge, it has been for &s;ome time pa&s;t a familiar In&s;tru|ment
<PB N="4" REF="4">in the hands of &s;everal Practitioners of the fir&s;t name in <HI>France, Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> as well as <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>With &s;o many and &s;uch re&s;pectable Suffrages in its favour, I thought the credit and u&s;e of the <HI>new Forceps</HI> had been univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, till I was lately convinced, by peru&s;ing your <HI>Remarks on that In&s;trument,</HI> that there was at lea&s;t one di&s;&s;enting voice. When, or in what manner, the&s;e Remarks were fir&s;t u&s;hered into light, I will not take upon me to &s;ay; but I am apt to think they had a <HI>clande&s;tine Birth,</HI> as I do not remember to have &s;een them adverti&s;ed in the u&s;ual way; a circum&s;tance which would not have readily e&s;caped me, as my fondne&s;s for Improvement, e&s;pecially at &s;o great a di&s;tance from Town, makes me always very attentive to the Ar|ticle of new Publications. It was by mere accident therefore, and only very lately, that I had the happy opportunity of &s;eeing this &s;triking Specimen of your Candour and literary Talents; and as &s;oon as I had glanced it over, I was determined to employ my fir&s;t in|tervals of lei&s;ure, from the duties of my Profe&s;&s;ion in vindicating Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> from &s;o illiberal and injurious an Attack. Together with this motive you may attribute as much as you plea&s;e to the vanity of a young man, whom you may &s;u&s;pect, perhaps, of &s;eeking for an occa&s;ion to try his &s;trength in the li&s;ts of Controver&s;y; and in|deed, to be perfectly ingenuous with you on this head, I will frank|ly own, that &s;o far as it may be natural to take courage from the weakne&s;s of an Adver&s;ary, I did think I could never hope for a bet|ter opportunity of making a fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay with &s;o little hazard to my Reputation.</P>
<P>In cen&s;uring Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s <HI>Forceps,</HI> which you are plea&s;ed to de|clare an ineffectual as well as a dangerous In&s;trument, you alledge the public good as your &s;ole inducement for undertaking the trou|ble of your <HI>precious</HI> Remarks upon it. This is certainly a good Plea, and worthy of a good Man; but it has been &s;o often hackneyed and abu&s;ed, that we are &s;ometimes apt to &s;u&s;pect a counterfeit. It is a
<PB N="5" REF="5">convenient pretence, however, when a man is either a&s;hamed or a|fraid to avow his real motives, and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it would not perhaps be difficult to a&s;&s;ign others. But as this may be a matter of conjecture only, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon it, as I would not wi&s;h to attack even an ungenerous Adver&s;ary, by the &s;ly method of In&s;inuation.</P>
<P>Allowing you, therefore, the full merit of your pretended zeal for the public &s;afety; let me a&s;k you, why you did not &s;ound the alarm &s;ooner, when as you &s;ay and would have it believed, there was &s;o much impending danger, and &s;uch <HI>dreadful con&s;equences</HI> to be appre|hended from the u&s;e of this In&s;trument? Let me &s;till further a&s;k you, why at length, the&s;e benevolent remarks of yours were not exhibited to the world in a public and open manner, in&s;tead, as I am informed, of being privately handed about, among &s;uch young and unexperienced Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion as were not compe|tent Judges of the &s;ubject? Did you mean that the poi&s;on conveyed in this artful and in&s;idious manner, &s;hould have time to operate and produce it effects before an antidote could be admini&s;tered?</P>
<P>As every man has an undoubted right to approve or di&s;approve of whatever is pre&s;ented to public view, I by no means blame you for making Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s <HI>Forceps</HI> a &s;ubject of enquiry, provided you had done it in the way of a candid examination, founded on the evidence of his own De&s;cription: a mode of trial to which no Au|thor can rea&s;onably object, and to which every one has an undeni|able claim. But how far you have done ju&s;tice to that Gentleman in your Quotations, or the conclu&s;ions you draw from them, will be left to the following Strictures, and the Reader's judgment without farther anticipation.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, Sir, that contrary to your method, I &s;hall quote and examine tho&s;e your remarks fairly, without pervert|ing your meaning, where that is to be found, or omitting one part and in&s;erting another, as be&s;t &s;uits my purpo&s;e. I mu&s;t likewi&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="6">inform you, that in quoting an Author you have no right either to <HI>alter</HI> the Diction or tran&s;po&s;e the Sentences, e&s;pecially in points of Controver&s;y, becau&s;e from thence may ari&s;e an alteration in the &s;en&s;e, which may wholly mi&s;repre&s;ent the original meaning; both which you have frequently done without ceremony, in your Remarks on Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s paper on the <HI>new Forceps.</HI> With the &s;kilful and candid, I believe, that paper might very &s;afely have been left to vindicate it&s;elf; but lea&s;t your Remarks, puerile and &s;uperficial as they are, &s;hould chance to mi&s;lead the unex|perienced, who &s;ometimes mi&s;take &s;ound for &s;en&s;e, I will proceed to examine and place them in their proper point of view.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over in a general way, the &s;elf-conceit, and fini|cal preci&s;ion, as well as the childi&s;h vanity and formal parade with which you are plea&s;ed to bring forth your elaborate trifle; which examined in all its parts, will appear to every eye but your own, a <HI>&s;hapele&s;s abortion,</HI> deformed, unfini&s;hed, and &s;ent before its time.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t article of your Remarks, you take the liberty to a&s;&s;ert, that Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s De&s;cription of the <HI>Forceps</HI> is not correct; but in what manner you make good that a&s;&s;ertion, the Reader will be&s;t be able to judge, from an exact quotation of his De&s;crip|tion, compared with your own.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s De&s;cription of the <HI>Forceps</HI> is as follows: <Q>"The <HI>Forceps</HI> u&s;ed in Midwifery may be con&s;idered as an In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ting of two Levers, which act in contrary Directions from one common Centre or Fulcrum, where their Blades unite and are &s;u&s;tained by each other, con&s;equently, their power on the Body to be moved will be in Proportion to the length of their <HI>Levers</HI> or Handles."</Q></P>
<P>The following in your De&s;cription. <HI>The Forceps ought to be con&s;idered as an in&s;trument con&s;i&s;ting of two Levers, acting alter|nately
<PB N="7" REF="7">from two centres, which are tho&s;e parts of the Child's head undergoing the greate&s;t friction.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;peak thus, is to a&s;&s;ert that the Forceps, which is the active body, finds a Fulcrum or re&s;ting point upon the Child's head which is wholly pa&s;&s;ive, being the very part which is to be extracted. I &s;hould be glad to a&s;k, how the Child's head can be the part from which the Blades act, &s;ince it is demon&s;tratively the part acted upon? A very &s;lender knowledge of Mechanics might have taught you that every Lever mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily act from its centre of motion; but on the contrary, if the Child's head afforded a centre of motion to the Blades of the Forceps, as you a&s;&s;ert, then it would follow, that tho&s;e Blades, con&s;idered as Levers, would not act <HI>from,</HI> but <HI>towards</HI> their centre of Mo|tion; a thing &s;o contrary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e as to de|&s;erve no further attention. In a word, Sir, you have palpably confounded the idea of the part acted upon by the Lever, with that of the part from which it acts. But perhaps you are about to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome new Principle in Mechanics, which may &s;olve this Paradox, and prove that an active and a pa&s;&s;ive body is one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;<HI>It is true, that with re&s;pect to them&s;elves, viz. (the Blades) the Centre of Motion will be at that part where they unite; but when in the hands of the Operator, and containing a body within their Curve, the alternate motion nece&s;&s;ary for the extraction of that body through a &s;mall &s;pace, changes the whole circum&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>It is wholly incon&s;i&s;tent and improper, thus to talk of Motion, or a Centre of Motion in a body (the <HI>Forceps</HI>) which as above, you are de&s;cribing totally at re&s;t; that is unemployed and not in the hands of the Operator.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>That when the Blades are really in the hands of the Operator, then the whole circum&s;tance is changed</HI>&mdash;Without doubt the circum&s;tance is changed, but not at all in the manner
<PB N="8" REF="8">you apprehend; for if the blades contain a body within their Curve, the action for the extraction of that body, mu&s;t &s;till be derived from their Junction as a re&s;ting Point, otherwi&s;e they would want a Fulcrum, and therefore could not act at all.&mdash;If this is difficult to be under&s;tood, you may, if you plea&s;e, &s;up|po&s;e two Blades without &s;uch junction, to be pa&s;&s;ed up along the Child's head, and as the&s;e Blades could not po&s;&s;ibly then be locked, they would not act on the Child's head, and con&s;equently it could not be extracted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Blades of the Forceps, con&s;idered as two Levers, do not act alternately as you tell us; for as both of them clo&s;ely and equally embrace the Child's head, the one cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made to act without the other; their action therefore is not <HI>alternate</HI> but <HI>&s;imultaneous.</HI></P>
<P>Such frivolous and far-fetched Objections &s;hew that you have taken great pains to find them out, and that you have been at whip and &s;pur in pur&s;uit of Game; but like an un&s;kilful Hunts|man who mi&s;takes the mettle of his Stead, as well as his own; you have unfortunately quite unhor&s;ed your&s;elf in attempting the five Bar-gate. Upon the whole, either your knowledge of Me|chanics &s;hould have been greater, or your pre&s;umption le&s;s, in contradicting e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;elf-evident principles.</P>
<P>So much for your Accuracy and Skill; I &s;hall next quote your &s;econd Article verbatim, as a curious &s;pecimen of your Candour, and the re&s;pect due to your Superiors:&mdash;Reader, plea&s;e to attend to the following mode&s;t A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><HI>Profe&s;&s;ors have generally mi&s;led us in the per&s;uit of practical knowledge, being too often of that order of men, who are the bane of real improvement.</HI> Inquirunt, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> non quomodo res &s;unt, &s;ed quid alii dicunt.</P>
<P>If &s;uch Profe&s;&s;ors are any where to be found, your preceding Remarks evidently &s;hew that you have no &s;mall Title to be
<PB N="9" REF="9">included in their number." <HI>Nomine mutato, de te fabula narratur.</HI> In a word, if &s;uch Reflections in one of real con&s;equence, who&s;e judgement was ripened by time and experience, would ju&s;tly be thought uncommonly pre&s;uming, and &s;o replete with arrogance as to have got the better of both prudence and decency;&mdash;What then &s;hall be &s;aid of&mdash;Dr. <HI>Thomas Denman.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you proceed,</P>
<P><HI>I believe there are rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;pecting that M. Crantz is but little qualified for laying down Rules for the u&s;e of In&s;truments in Midwifery, and M.</HI> Levrette <HI>is not unexceptionable authority.</HI></P>
<P>You ought to have mentioned tho&s;e Rea&s;ons at large, other|wi&s;e an affertion &s;o rude and injurious, on your own authority only, is claiming more credit than the Reader may be willing to allow you; for you mu&s;t know that M. <HI>Crantz</HI> was an eminent Profe&s;&s;or of Midwifery at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and that he wrote judiciou&s;ly on the U&s;e of In&s;truments, in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ert. de re in&s;trumentaria in arte ob&s;tetricaria,</HI> a book very nece&s;&s;ary for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>M. <HI>Levrette,</HI> you &s;ay, is not unexceptionable authority&mdash;If none but yours is oppo&s;ed to it, I believe it will remain un|exceptionable. To tell any other of the profe&s;&s;ion but your&s;elf who <HI>Levrette</HI> was, would be unnece&s;&s;ary; but as you have &s;pelt his name wrong as often as you have had occa&s;ion to mention it, it appears you have no better acquaintance with him than with the former Gentleman, whom you have &s;o uncivilly cen|&s;ured. <HI>Levret</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> is &s;ufficiently known throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> both by his Writings and public Lectures. In &s;hort, the Merit and Judgment of the two re&s;pectable Authors in que&s;tion are &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, and their reputation &s;o &s;uperior to your in&s;ignificant Cavils, that the pre&s;ent circum&s;tance would be apt to put one in mind of a Village-cur barking at the Moon.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to quote the &s;ub&s;tance of what Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> has advanced, and to examine the propriety and validity of your
<PB N="10" REF="10"><HI>Remarks</HI> on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.&mdash;In his de&s;cription of the <HI>Forceps</HI> he &s;peaks thus:</P>
<P><Q>"<HI>H. Crantz,</HI> profe&s;&s;or of Midwifery at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and <HI>Levret</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> both ob&s;erve, that when the Child's head is wedged within the bones of the Pelvis, <HI>(capite incuneato)</HI> it can &s;carcely ever be extracted by the <HI>common Forceps</HI> recommended by <HI>Smellie,</HI> becau&s;e of their &s;hortne&s;s; and as their Blades are only curved in one Direction, whenever it happens that the Hind-head is forced over the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes, it cannot be got hold of within the curve of the Blades, which being only applied along the Ears in a &s;treight Direction, are therefore apt to &s;lip downwards over the Face, and to foil the Operator in the Extraction of the Head: This will the rather happen, becau&s;e they are made taper towards their Points, which will dimini&s;h their contact on the head and prevent them from taking a firm hold;&mdash;<HI>&s;o that they are the lea&s;t &s;erviceable in tho&s;e very Ca&s;es where they are the mo&s;t wanted,</HI>&mdash;that is, where the Pelvis is narrow; for it mu&s;t be allowed, of all Difficulties, that which happens from the above cau&s;e, is by far the mo&s;t in|&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to the birth, &s;ince it can only be over|come by very &s;trong Pains, which compre&s;s the head and force it to conform to the bony Pa&s;&s;age."</Q></P>
<P>Your remarks on the preceding Paragraph are as follows:&mdash;<HI>When the Head is</HI> incuneatum, enclav&eacute;e, <HI>or wedged in the Pelvis, it is a ca&s;e in which Forceps of any kind cannot be u&s;ed with prudence. If we did try them, we &s;hould happily mi&s;carry in the attempt, for if we &s;ucceeded, dreadful would be the con&s;equence to the parts of the Mother, cru&s;hed between the Child's head and Forceps on one hand, and the bones of the Pelvis on the other.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader is here pre&s;ented with a di&s;h of all &s;orts,&mdash;a perfect <HI>Oleo,</HI> but without a &s;ingle grain of &s;alt or &s;ea&s;oning, curiou&s;ly garni&s;hed with fre&s;h rhetorical flowers, but of the <HI>exotic
<PB N="11" REF="11">kind;</HI> &s;uch as that of mi&s;carrying happily; &s;ucce&s;s being attended with dreadful con&s;equences, &amp;c.</P>
<P>You tell us that, <HI>The Doctrine of applying Forceps before the bulk of the Head has pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperior aperture of the Pelvis, carries great danger and in&s;urmountable difficulties on the face of it. Tho&s;e who have endeavoured to reduce it to practice (for it is an old and ob&s;olete Doctrine) have in their accounts given us Hi&s;tories of their attempting it, of the difficulties they met with, of the mi&s;chiefs they did, and a retraction of their Errors.</HI></P>
<P>According to your account, this Doctrine wears a very <HI>frightful and gorgon-like countenance.</HI>&mdash;Alas poor pro&s;tituted <HI>word Doctrine!</HI> how mi&s;erably art thou profaned and mi&s;applied; I fear thou wilt next be tack'd to the method of making pea&s;e-pottage, or manufacturing mutton-pies. But to be &s;erious; was it not doing inju&s;tice to <HI>John Bunyan</HI> by the compari&s;on; I &s;hould think I had been reading his de&s;cription of the <HI>Pilgrim's Progre&s;s</HI> through the Vale of Tears.</P>
<P>When the greate&s;t bulk of the Head has pa&s;&s;ed the &s;uperior Aperture of the Pelvis, the greate&s;t difficulty is over, as appears by the following quotation from Dr. <HI>Leake,</HI> and therefore the Forceps are &s;eldom ever then nece&s;&s;ary, except floodings or other dangerous &s;ymptoms &s;hould &s;uddenly exhau&s;t the Patient's &s;trength.</P>
<P><Q>"The <HI>&s;hort Forceps</HI> may indeed be effectually applied when the Child's head is low in the Pelvis, but where that is the Ca&s;e, artificial A&s;&s;i&s;tance is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary, the principal Difficulty being then over; and &s;hould any &s;till remain, it will now be removed by the Concurrence of two Cau&s;es, viz. the inferior Parts of the Pelvis will gradually dilate and give way to the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Head, which, at the &s;ame time, will be &s;queezed into a longitudinal Form, and therefore its tran&s;ver&s;e Diameter, in re&s;pect to the Pa&s;&s;age, will become con&s;iderably
<PB N="12" REF="12">le&s;s and le&s;s; both which Circum&s;tances have a manife&s;t ten|dency to facilitate the Birth."</Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e then, and &s;uch like your Remarks, are more than &s;uffi|ciently an&s;wered by the following quotation from Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s Paper, which &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of the practice he recommends, and al&s;o that he was not unaware of Cavil and Critici&s;m.</P>
<Q><P>"I know that the Application of the Forceps is objected to by &s;ome, till after the Head has got below the Brim of the Pelvis, on the Suppo&s;ition that the Force applied to bring it down would prove injurious to the Mother;&mdash;but will not the <HI>violent and long continued Compre&s;&s;ion of the &s;oft Parts,</HI> viz. the <HI>Vagina</HI> and <HI>Neck of the Bladder,</HI> &amp;c. when &s;queezed between the Head and Bones of the Pelvis, as two &s;olid Bodies, be much more liable to endanger the Patient?&mdash;Since In&s;tances may be found where a <HI>Mortification</HI> has been the Con&s;equence, and where the Child, which always &s;uffers in Proportion, was al&s;o <HI>born dead.</HI></P>
<P>In ca&s;es, therefore, extremely laborious, when the <HI>Head is large,</HI> &mdash;the <HI>Pelvis narrow,</HI> or both;&mdash;where the Patient's Strength is exhau&s;ted by a <HI>Flooding,</HI>&mdash;where &s;he is &s;uddenly at|tacked with <HI>Convul&s;ions, Faintings,</HI> or other alarming Symptoms, and con&s;equently, where the <HI>labour Pains are in&s;ufficient</HI> to bring forth the Child; the <HI>long double curved Forceps,</HI> hereafter de|&s;cribed, may be u&s;ed with great &s;afety and advantage, either with or without the <HI>Lever</HI> or <HI>third blade,</HI> as occa&s;ion may re|quire.&mdash;Every one who has had much Experience knows, that it is often improper, as well as difficult and dangerous to turn the Child, and &s;ometimes even <HI>impracticable</HI> without bur&s;ting the Uterus, or applying &s;o much Violence as might be fatal to the Mother; and to open the head of a <HI>living infant,</HI> before the <HI>long Forceps</HI> and every other Expedient had been tried in vain, would &s;urely be deemed ra&s;h and unnatural Practice."</P></Q>

<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that whatever Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> recommends he al|ways gives his rea&s;ons for it; but what you advance is only mere matter of a&s;&s;ertion, or if you attempt any thing further, &s;uch is your &s;ucce&s;s, that what you endeavour to prove, &s;till remains to be proved by &s;ome other per&s;on.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is&mdash;What &s;hould be done for the &s;afety of the Mo|ther when her &s;trength is exhau&s;ted, and her pains in&s;ufficient to bring the Child; &s;o that &s;he is every moment in danger of dying undelivered.&mdash;Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> admits, there is danger in the Operation, but at the &s;ame time &s;hews why there is much more, when it is neglected, and therefore, of two evils, the lea&s;t is to be cho&s;en; e&s;pecially &s;ince there is no other alternative, than that one of kil|ling the Child, by opening its head; for he has &s;hewn that <HI>Smellie</HI>'s <HI>Forceps</HI> are much too &s;hort to reach and extract it thus &s;ituated, and that it is by no means eligible to turn the child: &s;o that all you have been able to advance again&s;t this practice, is mere invective; being nothing but a few formidable Epithets to excite horror, and to deter the weak and timorous from u&s;ing the Forceps recom|mended by Dr. <HI>Leake;</HI> and le&s;t his ingenious Invention of combi|ning the action of the Forceps and Lever, &s;hould chance to pluck a feather out of your wing.</P>
<P>You talk of dreadful con&s;equences, and cru&s;hing of heads, as others would talk of cracking nuts; but if &s;uch rea&s;oning as this could prevail; then the u&s;e of the &s;hort Forceps, of which you are &s;o fond, &s;hould al&s;o be rejected, even when the Child's head is below the brim of the Pelvis; for fear of lacerating the Perinaeum; and for the very &s;ame rea&s;on if it could be found to have any weight, no Surgeon would ever venture to cut for the Stone, le&s;t the patient &s;hould die by the con&s;equence of the Operation.</P>
<P>You &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the hind-head is forced over the Sym|phy&s;is of the Pubes. Whenever this is the Ca&s;e it is not po&s;&s;ible to apply Forceps of any kind, with advantage, or without the utmo&s;t danger; and
<PB N="14" REF="14">I call upon every Gentleman conver&s;ant in practice to confirm the truth of the A&s;&s;ertion.</HI></P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible, you &s;ay, to apply Forceps of any kind. Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> being apprized of the difficulty attending the application of all Forceps <HI>in this particular ca&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e of their lateral pre&s;&s;ure, which increa&s;es the longitudinal diameter of the head, and forces the <HI>Occiput</HI> &s;till more over the Pubes, has therefore, invented a <HI>third Blade,</HI> which combined with the Forceps acts as a Lever, applied immediately to the re&s;i&s;ting point or <HI>Occiput;</HI> and that without the lea&s;t danger of hurting the mother; a circum&s;tance which has often happened by the u&s;e of the common Lever.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e things premi&s;ed and duly attended to, I think it will fol|low that you may call on Gentlemen conver&s;ant in practice a long time before they an&s;wer to the truth of your A&s;&s;ertion, without your appeal is made to tho&s;e who are as much aver&s;e to improvement as you &s;eem to be your&s;elf, and who chu&s;e to grope in the dark, when they might walk in open day.</P>
<P>The following Ab&s;tract from Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s <HI>de&s;cription of his Forceps,</HI> will &s;till more fully illu&s;trate and explain the true nature and u&s;e of the Lever or <HI>third Blade,</HI> and &s;hew under what particular circum|&s;tances its application becomes nece&s;&s;ary and advantageous.</P>
<Q><P>"When the fore-head pre&s;ents to the Os Sacrum, and the hind-head to the <HI>Pubes,</HI> the long axis of the head inter&s;ects the &s;hort axis of the Pelvis, and therefore, the&s;e Parts may be con&s;idered as two Ellip&s;es cro&s;&s;ing each other;&mdash;a Po&s;ition of the head very un|favourable to the Birth of the Child.&mdash;Whenever this is the Ca&s;e, a very capital Inconvenience, even in the long double-cur|ved Forceps will occur, for when they are thus applied on the Sides of the Head, the more it is there compre&s;&s;ed by the Action of the Blades, the more will the <HI>Hind-head be forced over the Pubes,</HI> and the <HI>Fore-head again&s;t the Sacrum,</HI> which will &s;till add to the difficulty, and con&s;equently it cannot be extracted in this
<PB N="15" REF="15">manner, without great violence both to the Mother and the Child:&mdash;This Circum&s;tance has happened to me in Practice &s;everal times, particularly in two laborious Ca&s;es, where the re|peated Application of the Blades at the &s;ides proved ineffectual; and dangerous Symptoms appearing, I was afraid of further delay, and therefore, (the patient being placed on her &s;ide) I introduced them at the Sacrum and Pubes, that is, on the <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Occiput,</HI> and extracted the head with ea&s;e at the fir&s;t effort.</P>
<P>As this Succe&s;s was plainly owing to the Compre&s;&s;ion of the longe&s;t part of the Head, it fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to me the Hint of ap|plying a pair of <HI>Forceps with three Blades,</HI> one of which may be occa&s;ionally u&s;ed as a <HI>Lever,</HI> which will act on the &s;ame Princi|ple as that of <HI>Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming Simplicity of <HI>Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s Lever, it may be attended with the utmo&s;t Danger; for, as the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes is the Centre from which it acts, and the Point upon which the whole Stre&s;s is laid, whenever much force is applied to bring down the head, (Action and Re-action being the &s;ame) the <HI>Vagina, Neck of the Bladder,</HI> and <HI>nervous Parts</HI> may be &s;o violently brui&s;ed, as to occa&s;ion a <HI>Mortifi|cation,</HI> or even the very Symphy&s;is of the Pubes may happen to give way.</P>
<P>To remedy this Inconvenience, which is the principal Objec|tion to the <HI>Lever,</HI> I have, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, in my Cour&s;e of Lectures on Midwifery, recommended an <HI>In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ting</HI> of <HI>three Blades,</HI> being, in fact nothing more than a Pair of long Forceps with a double Curve, and the Addition of a Lever, which may be applied without the lea&s;t danger of hurting the Mother; for here the <HI>Fulcrum</HI> of the <HI>Lever</HI> is <HI>removed from the Pubes to the Junction of the two Blades,</HI> which not only act as a Pair of Forceps, but at the &s;ame time afford a firm re&s;ting Point
<PB N="16" REF="16">for the third Blade, by means of a &s;mall Pivot or central Pin, placed on the under Side of one of their Blades.</P>
<P>After the Introduction of the Blades of the&s;e Forceps at the Sides of the Child's-head, this Lever is to be pa&s;&s;ed up between the Occiput and Pubes, and as the Pelvis there forms a kind of Arch, and is al&s;o extremely &s;hallow; by inclining the Handle low towards the Perinaeum, it may be introduced without the lea&s;t Degree of Violence.</P>
<P>The additional Blade or Lever applied immediately to the re|&s;i&s;ting Point or Occiput, where it re&s;ts at the Pubes, will not only effectually &s;horten the Head, and detach it from the Place of its Ob&s;truction, but will al&s;o prevent the Forceps from &s;lip|ping; for if they tend down towards the Face, the <HI>Lever,</HI> which is fixed at the Hind-head, and &s;u&s;tained at the Junction of the Blades, mu&s;t be drawn down with them, and con&s;equently the head al&s;o will &s;till be the more brought into the Centre of the Pelvis, and therefore more ea&s;ily extracted; which may be better under&s;tood by referring to the <HI>third Figure in the</HI> Copper-plate.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>the&s;e two mechanical Powers of the Forceps and Lever thus combined, will mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other;</HI>&mdash;For, the Lever will not only <HI>prevent the Forceps from &s;lipping,</HI> but will al&s;o <HI>&s;horten the Head,</HI> and bring it down below the Arch of the Pubes into the Centre of the Pelvis, by which means it may be the more ea&s;ily extracted; on the other Hand, the Forceps will afford a re&s;ting Point to the Lever, from which it may effectually act <HI>without any Sort of Danger to the Patient,</HI> &s;o that we have the Advantages of both In&s;truments, without the defects of either."</P></Q>
<P>Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> does not here vainly magnify the merit of inventing this new In&s;trument, but plainly tells us, it was owing to a mere matter of accident which occurred to him in practice.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="17">
<P>You tell us that&mdash;<HI>The cen&s;ure of Dr.</HI> Smellie<HI>'s Forceps is unpro|fitable</HI>&mdash;You cannot then &s;ay, that Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> is mercenary; but I mu&s;t inform you that to cen&s;ure and to di&s;approve are very different things: Tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> well know that he is le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to cen&s;ure than commend; and it is apparent he has not treated Dr. <HI>Smellie</HI> in the di&s;re&s;pectful manner with which you mention the Names of <HI>M. Leveret</HI> and <HI>H. Crantz.</HI></P>
<P>You next proceed as a panegyri&s;t&mdash;<HI>Dr. Smellie was a Man of great candour, indu&s;try, and ingenuity, and we are all indebted to him.</HI> I have often heard Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> in the cour&s;e of his Lectures men|tion his name with great re&s;pect, and chearfully &s;ub&s;cribe to his merit.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;<HI>We are all indebted to him.</HI> Tho&s;e who have attended his Lectures, I pre&s;ume, will not deny it; for your part, Sir, had you been as grateful to the Gentleman from whom you received your In&s;tructions in Midwifery, we &s;hould not have &s;een you engaged with him in a News-paper Billing&s;gate conte&s;t, A. D. 1769.</P>
<P>Again you &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Dr.</HI> Smellie<HI>'s Forceps are not taper at the point</HI>&mdash;Not &s;o taper as the point of a Sword;&mdash;but they are taper&mdash;verily they are <HI>taper.</HI></P>
<P>You add&mdash;<HI>The largene&s;s of the head, and narrowne&s;s of the Pelvis are relative terms,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;This &s;eems to be a new and very notable di&s;co|very, and what makes it the more valuable, it is not more difficult to be demon&s;trated, than that two and one make three.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;<HI>The ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed in this Paragraph, I believe, never can happen at the upper part of the Pelvis.</HI></P>
<P>In what Paragraph? for you do not &s;ay, whether in Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s, or your own. Pray Doctor <HI>what Profe&s;&s;or, except &s;uch as you have mentioned in the beginning of your Remarks,</HI> ever talks of a Ca&s;e happening at the upper part of the Pelvis; I &s;uppo&s;e you mean a ca&s;e where the Child's head could not happen to be &s;o placed
<PB N="18" REF="18">at the upper part of the Pelvis; if this is not your meaning, the ca&s;e you allude to mu&s;t be a headle&s;s ca&s;e, a ca&s;e without a head;&mdash;a very piteous ca&s;e indeed, and &s;uch as probably never happened to any one except Dr. <HI>Thomas Denman.</HI></P>
<P>You proceed&mdash;<HI>My rea&s;on for preferring the &s;treight Forceps, is a conviction that this opinion is true, and that under the&s;e circum&s;tances the curvilinear Forceps become inconvenient.</HI></P>
<P>Your rea&s;on is a conviction that this Opinion is true:&mdash;A very curious rea&s;on indeed; but I &s;hall &s;ay no more on this pa&s;&s;age, le&s;t I make a mi&s;take; for I confe&s;s 'tis far too &s;ublime for my comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay&mdash;<HI>I know enough of the Hi&s;tory of the Vectes, in as able hands as Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s, <HI>to convince any rea&s;onable man, that much mi&s;chief may, and has been done by them.</HI></P>
<P>For this very rea&s;on Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> has contrived a Lever or Vectes, which occa&s;ionally combined with the Forceps, will produce all the effects of a Lever without the lea&s;t danger of hurting the Mother.</P>
<P>Thus you proceed&mdash;Roonhuy&s;en<HI>'s Vectes changes its centre of action, and though it may be fixed again&s;t the Symphy&s;is of the Pubes, the Ramus of the I&s;chium, near the obtu&s;e proce&s;s, mu&s;t become the</HI> Ful|crum, <HI>or you will not be able to extract the head.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is pre&s;umed you meant to have &s;aid <HI>ignoramus,</HI> and that by &s;ome unaccountable blunder of the Printer's, the word <HI>Ramus</HI> unluckily &s;lipt in.</P>
<P>You tell us that&mdash;<HI>The re&s;i&s;ting Point is not particularly where the hind head pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Pubes; but that the head is wedged and pre&s;&s;es on many Points.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;eem here to have forgot what every Practitioner in Mid|wifery ought particularly to remember, viz. that the Brim of the Pelvis is an Ellip&s;is from &s;ide to &s;ide, and mea&s;ured in that direc|tion, is one inch wider than from Sacrum to Pubes; and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="19" REF="19">the Head thus wedged in the bony pa&s;&s;age, mu&s;t of cour&s;e meet with mo&s;t re&s;i&s;tance where the Pelvis is narrowe&s;t; particularly, as the long axis of the Head is now turned to the narrow axis of the Pelvis, or as Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, where two Ellip&s;es are cro&s;&s;ing each other; and therefore, contrary to your a&s;&s;ertion, the re&s;i&s;ting point mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be where the hind-head pre&s;&s;es again&s;t the Pubes.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;<HI>You object to the u&s;e of all curvilinear Forceps</HI>&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e then you mean to make u&s;e of none at all; for all Forceps are <HI>curvilinear,</HI> or they could not be Forceps; but all Forceps have not a two-fold curve, which I pre&s;ume is the thing you mean.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you continue to &s;peak, and le&s;t the elegance of your expre&s;&s;ions &s;hould &s;uffer by the lea&s;t alteration, I &s;hall &s;et them down <HI>verbatim.&mdash;The curve of M.</HI> Levrett<HI>'s Forceps &s;eems the mo&s;t convenient, and Mr.</HI> O&s;born <HI>has contrived a very elegant pair, by dimini&s;hing the &s;ize of</HI> Levrett<HI>'s and very little alteration be&s;ides.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t now you objected to the u&s;e of all &s;uch Forceps, but now all of a &s;udden <HI>Levret</HI>'s are the mo&s;t convenient; how does this accord?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as you &s;ay that Mr. <HI>O&s;born</HI>'s Forceps differs very little from <HI>Levret</HI>'s, except in &s;ize, it is not ea&s;y to conceive how a diminution of the &s;ize alone, can properly be con&s;idered as a new invention. But here let me a&s;k you whether this Contrivance of Mr. <HI>O&s;born</HI>'s, whatever it may be, was prior or &s;ub&s;equent to that de&s;cribed by Dr. <HI>Leake.</HI> A direct an&s;wer to this &s;imple que&s;tion might probably unfold the my&s;tery, and determine what merit is due to Mr. <HI>O&s;born</HI> from this <HI>very elegant pair of Forceps.</HI></P>
<P>Again you &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Allowing Dr.</HI> Leake <HI>the full force of his own rea&s;oning, I cannot conceive the advantage ari&s;ing from this complicated In&s;trument.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="20">
<P>Here, like the Satyr in the Fable, you blow hot and cold with the &s;ame breath; for hitherto you have endeavoured to con|trovert his rea&s;oning in the be&s;t manner you were able; but now comes a kind of aukward and indirect a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>You &s;ay&mdash;<HI>You cannot conceive the advantage ari&s;ing from this complicated In&s;trument.</HI></P>
<P>The Forceps recommended by Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> is by no means complicated, for whenever the Lever is unnece&s;&s;ary, they may always be applied alone with the &s;ame ea&s;e and &s;afety, and gene|rally with a better effect than any other, for the rea&s;ons which he has &s;pecified.</P>
<P>Thus you proceed&mdash;<HI>If we act with the Forceps from handle to handle, the third Blade can do no &s;ervice.</HI></P>
<P>The Lever or <HI>third Blade</HI> will effectually prevent the Forceps from &s;lipping down over the Child's Face, which is a very capital advantage, e&s;pecially as it cannot in the lea&s;t injure the Mother more than the other two, although we act with them from handle to handle.</P>
<P>Again you &s;ay&mdash;<HI>If we act with the Lever, the Forceps are u&s;ele&s;s or prejudicial.</HI></P>
<P>You have before allowed that <HI>Roonhuy&s;en</HI>'s Lever is a dangerous In&s;trument; but as Dr. <HI>Leake</HI> has proved to a demon&s;tration, that the Lever combined with the Forceps, may always be &s;afely and advantageou&s;ly applied, both your a&s;&s;ertions become evidently groundle&s;s. Indeed, throughout the whole of your performance, from a doating affection for every thing you have &s;aid on the &s;ubject, you have never been fortunate enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the very great difference between &s;imple a&s;&s;ertions and &s;olid proofs; the fir&s;t are always ready at every man's call&mdash;upon the la&s;t de|pends the fair and equitable deci&s;ion of all points of controver&s;y whatever.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="21">
<P>I have now examined mo&s;t of your Remarks, yet I confe&s;s that &s;ome of them are ab&s;olutely unan&s;werable;&mdash;tho&s;e, Sir, alone are they which are utterly unintelligible; and to conclude, if I am not mi&s;taken, as you were, when in &s;peaking of the Forceps, you mi&s;|took the Child's Head for their Centre of Motion, all your Views centre in your&s;elf; though even that part of your de&s;ign you have executed but very indifferently, for your Style is clum&s;y, a&s;&s;um|ing, and pedantic; your Objections are frivolous and unfairly urged, and your A&s;&s;ertions, though po&s;itive, and highly expre&s;|&s;ive of &s;elf-importance, are generally un&s;upported by rea&s;oning and matter of fact.&mdash;To conclude, con&s;idering the air of exultation with which you &s;et out, it may be &s;aid with great ju&s;tice and truth, that the whole of your performance <HI>is mo&s;t pompou&s;ly poor indeed.</HI></P>
<P>You tell us, that you pay great regard to Dr. <HI>Leake</HI>'s Abilities; I wi&s;h I could with a &s;afe con&s;cience &s;ay as much for you; for if I was di&s;po&s;ed to compliment you on your abilities, your candour mu&s;t &s;uffer; and if I had an opinion of your candour, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be at the expence of your Abilities.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you have &s;hot your lilliputian Arrows and wounded nothing but Air; when you can &s;pare a little more of your precious time to advance any thing further on this &s;ubject for the <HI>public good,</HI> I &s;hall not be wanting in giving it due Attention.</P>
