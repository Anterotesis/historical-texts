<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS burle&s;que writing has of late taken place of &s;ober enquiry, on the &s;ubject of inoculation; I doubt not its merits are &s;o fully a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the opinion of &s;ome, as not to &s;tand in need of farther examination. Some there are however who think other|wi&s;e. If I perchance &s;hould be of that number, may I be &s;uffered a little in my folly; e&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame time, I declare my &s;entiments candidly and hone&s;tly, and endea|vour
<PB N="iv" REF="3">to explain its nature more fully, than I find is already done to my hands, by any author. And let the gentlemen of wit take this friendly caution with them, To take care that, in the u&s;e of talents, allowed at be&s;t to be but dangerous, they do not unwarily &s;tumble upon &s;ubjects, too important for their ap|plication. Let it be al&s;o con&s;i|dered, that it is but a mean and illiberal employment, to be the re|tailers of low je&s;ts. Can any thing equal the native beauty and dignity of truth, in her mo&s;t &s;imple dre&s;s? &s;he is, in fact, a mo&s;t delicate mi&s;tre&s;s, that mu&s;t be wooed in her own way, and will not bear being laughed at and jeered to her face. For a while then raillery apart from
<PB N="v" REF="4">di&s;qui&s;itions in phy&s;ic, for that is a part of truth.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s and depravity of human judgment is in nothing more con&s;picuous, than the tendency it has of running into erroneous ex|tremes. The bad effects of this unhappy propen&s;ity of carrying our prejudices, for favourite opinions and practice, too far, phy&s;ic, in com|mon with other &s;ubjects, has often felt; and it appears plainly to me, that the &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, whereby we examine only things pre&s;ent, and which is a grand cau&s;e of error in general, contributes not a little to our forming an erroneous judg|ment, in the matter before us. However, in enquiries after truth,
<PB N="vi" REF="5">a &s;ubject which di&s;claims all imper|fect notions, or partial repre&s;enta|tions, it is nece&s;&s;ary the mind, un|der &s;afe guidance, &s;hould take into its view, if po&s;&s;ible, the whole that relates to a &s;ubject, and examine every thing with the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t fixed attention.</P>
<P>Tho' &s;everal &s;en&s;ible and judicious writers &s;eem to entertain very &s;an|guine hopes, concerning the pre&s;ent method of inoculation, to whom, and to who&s;e writings, I wi&s;h to pay all due deference; though, I hope, I al&s;o wi&s;h well to all me|thods, which truly conduce to the health and pre&s;ervation of mankind, as well as have long known the importance of proper preparation,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">both before the natural, and inocu|lated &s;mall-pox: yet &s;orry I am to &s;ay, I am obliged to con&s;ider the pre&s;ent reigning mode, on the whole; as one of tho&s;e dangerous extremes, which will be productive of bad con&s;equences, to the health of this, and &s;ucceeding generations. I mu&s;t al&s;o, upon the principles and expe|rience, hereafter to be laid down, go yet farther, and declare I am far from being &s;o well fatisfied about inoculation in general, as not to be aware, that it is a &s;ubject, which has never been well cleared up; that, tho' it is become pretty univer&s;al in England, it &s;till wants the concurrence of many of the eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion, and of more of tho&s;e abroad; the unpre|judiced
<PB N="viii" REF="7">opinion of any of which, if happily &s;uch are to be found, I think, de&s;erves to be attended to.</P>
<P>There is &s;omewhat of original rectitude, or its contrary, in mo&s;t things, which di&s;covers it&s;elf, to an impartial ob&s;erver, at fir&s;t &s;ight. This te&s;timony inoculation appa|rently wants, in an eminent degree; or it had become long &s;ince uni|ver&s;al. And tho' the main argu|ment, its pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, be &s;trong in its favour; it is not infallible upon the principles and experience laid down in the following pages. I heartily wi&s;h I may be mi&s;taken in my opinion, and that inocula|tion really may be that u&s;eful and &s;alutary practice, I believe, many
<PB N="ix" REF="8">eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion, and others out of it, judge it to be. How|ever, as that opinion is founded on ob&s;ervation and experience, and a long and clo&s;e attention to the rea|&s;on of things; till inoculation &s;hall happily &s;tand upon a better founda|tion, than pre&s;ent, perhaps tran&s;ient &s;ucce&s;s, I cannot help retaining it.</P>
<P>I am, at the &s;ame time, fully &s;en&s;ible, how ill &s;uch &s;entiments agree, with the notions entertained by the patrons of inoculation; e&s;pe|cially by the warmer advocates for the pre&s;ent method. Nothing there|fore &s;hould have induced me pub|lickly to declare them, but the &s;tronge&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion of their truth; and an opinion, that it is the duty
<PB N="x" REF="9">of a writer to declare truth, or the be&s;t apprehen&s;ions he has of it. I have therefore herein delivered my &s;entiments to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who, being per&s;ons of due temper, will coolly hear rea&s;on, on every &s;ide of an argument; and who, having al&s;o ability to trace back effects to cau&s;es, and to inve|&s;tigate di&s;ea&s;es in their very prin|ciples and &s;ource, are the only per|&s;ons qualified to judge; who, being endued with a&s;&s;iduity and applica|tion, will diligently ob&s;erve not only pre&s;ent effects, but remoter con&s;e|quences; and who, being al&s;o men of integrity and candour, will faith|fully communicate &s;uch ob&s;ervations. By &s;uch, and &s;uch only, can the jarring opinions, relative to this &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="xi" REF="10">be at length determined. For my own part, my ob&s;ervations have been very unfavourable to it, at lea&s;t in the light I have con&s;idered them. As it appears undeniably clear to me, that if inoculation, or any other cau&s;e, is capable of increa&s;ing here|ditary or acquired &s;curvy, when al&s;o conjoined with the u&s;e of violent do&s;es of mercurials, the pre&s;ent too common and pernicious u&s;e of warm relaxing liquors, or any &s;pecies of intemperance which enfeebles the body; they will not fail to promote a decay, and a falling off, in this and each &s;ucceeding generation, from the pri&s;tine health and vigour of their ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD>THE NATURE of INOCULATION EXPLAINED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the nature of variolous matter, its &s;eat in, and effects on the blood.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOLOUS matter is a pe&s;tilen|tial <HI>virus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' this is a matter apparently beyond doubt, from the very nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and e&s;pecially its effects in the confluent kind; it is &s;urprizing to find that few writers have been of this opinion, except Rhazes, the late Dr. Mead, and the pre&s;ent Dr. Ru&s;ton.</NOTE> <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> that, upon reception into the body, takes its &s;eat in, and contaminates, that heterogeneous<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am &s;orry I cannot agree with Dr. Ru&s;ton, in opinion, that the variolous matter is apt to infect per|fectly a&s;&s;imilated juices; as then the heat and irri|tation, occa&s;ioned by mercurial medicines, would be pernicious. Their action upon heterogeneous mat|ter, better accounts for the good effects of prepa|ration thereby; as they are known to di&s;charge &s;uch matter from the body. Be&s;ides, were the more per|fect juices in general tainted, nature would have no re&s;ource left, whereby to &s;eparate the di&s;ea&s;ed humours from the body.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="12">part of the blood and juices, which is vi&s;cid; e&s;pecially that which, by rea&s;on of taking unwhole&s;ome, or too much animal food, or any kind of high living, or by being retained long in the ve&s;&s;els, without being a&s;&s;imilated into a good and perfect &s;tate, is become putre&s;cent; or tenacious and acrimonious, and therefore &s;trictly &s;corbutieal.</P>
<P>This taint in the humours may be either hereditary or acquired, and, it may be &s;afely &s;aid, is almo&s;t always both. It &s;erves for a nidus, wherein the variolous matter re&s;ts; and which it by degrees heats and corrupts, in the manner other
<PB N="3" REF="13">putrid effluviae do; but has not power of the more pure, globular, and perfect part of the blood and juices, if the other he|terogeneous corrupted part does not very much abound, and the con&s;titution is ca|pable of expelling it.</P>
<P>When the above de&s;cribed matter is &s;o corrupted by the variolous virus, and, as it were, changed into its own nature; the &s;ubtle effluviae ari&s;ing therefrom &s;timu|late the nerves, and rouze up that &s;y&s;tem, in proportion to the &s;trength it has, or as the peccant matter may more or le&s;s abound, to endeavour at its expul&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the matter then to be expelled, either by rea&s;on of natural health, tem|perance, or the power of preparation, is &s;mall, the di&s;ea&s;e is of the di&s;tinct kind; when large, of the confluent. And the&s;e, together with the effect a too rigid, re|laxed, or due tone of the fibres, and the reigning con&s;titution of the air, or the
<PB N="4" REF="14">climate, may have, &s;eem to be the real cau&s;es, which occa&s;ion the variety in this di&s;ea&s;e; which does not ari&s;e from any difference in the variolous matter it&s;elf; as is abundantly proved by numberle&s;s in&s;tances, of per&s;ons receiving the mo&s;t favourable &s;mall-pox, from the wor&s;t kinds thereof.</P>
<P>The above well accounts, why &s;ome per&s;ons are not liable, to take the &s;mall-pox, at all times; if it happens there is no heterogeneous corruptible matter in the body, at the time, for the effluviae to lodge in. As to the rea&s;on, why per&s;ons have the &s;mall-pox, or any &s;uch pe&s;tilential di&s;order but once; it is at pre&s;ent only re&s;olvable, into the will of that merciful Providence, who pre&s;ides over us. The cau&s;e of which will pro|bably ever remain among tho&s;e wonder|ful arcana, which human penetration may admire at a di&s;tance, but cannot &s;earch into.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the proce&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e in the natural &s;mall-pox, and its frequent beneficial effects, in tho&s;e who recover.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the morbid effluviae from the corrupted matter above de&s;cribed, begin to be predominant, they irritate and di&s;tend the nerves, and bring on the known &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e; pain in the head and back, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;to|mach, and an univer&s;al languor, &amp;c. All the powers of the body ri&s;e to expel this dreadful enemy, and a fever commences: whereby the morbid matter is in &s;ome mea&s;ure attenuated; but great part of it being &s;till incapable of being &s;ecreted, by the general outlets of the body, and in particular by per&s;piration; yet withal too irritating and dangerous, to be retained any longer within; is determined how|ever that way, viz. to the &s;urface of the
<PB N="6" REF="16">&s;kin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be here ob&s;erved, that miliary fevers ari&s;e from the &s;ame &s;tate of the humours without infection, and the &s;ame incapacity in nature to di&s;charge them; wherefore antimonials and calomel, in &s;uch ca&s;es, lay the ba&s;is of a cure.</NOTE> by one general and powerful effort. When therefore the matter to be &s;o expelled is not abundant, nature per|forms this with more ea&s;e, and by a more gradual expul&s;ion; when it predominates, if the &s;trength is good, the attempt is more violent. Hence ari&s;es, &s;ome ca&s;es, depending on extraordinary weakne&s;s of the nerves, and vi&s;cidity of the juices, excepted, that u&s;ual difference in the pe|riod of eruption, which is a general cri|terion, whereby to judge of the mildne&s;s, or malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When the eruption is compleated, na|ture &s;till carries on her work, by a farther gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ual attenuation and determination, of any remaining matter in the blood, to the pu&s;tules; bringing on hereby their matu|ration,
<PB N="7" REF="17">which, when fully compleated, is the cri&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e. And the pu&s;|tules, having attained that degree of per|fection, by degrees harden and fall off, which terminates it.</P>
<P>In the natural &s;mall-pox then, the va|riolous effluviae having taken full effect on the vi&s;cid, &s;corbutic, putre&s;cent matter above de&s;cribed, as not having been drawn off by any partial di&s;charge beforehand, nor its determination changed, the efforts of the con&s;titution in expelling it, are powerful, uniform and regular, at lea&s;t in good habits; and above all, natural: and, whatever we may pretend, nature is mo&s;t perfect in her operations, when the ob&s;tacles to be &s;urmounted are not very great; and all good phy&s;ic depends upon a knowledge, and ob&s;ervance of her laws.</P>
<P>The good effects, attending the natu|ral &s;mall-pox, are tho&s;e of greatly le&s;&s;en|ing, nay, often of eradicating, not only
<PB N="8" REF="18">acquired, but hereditary &s;curvy, tran&s;|mitted through preceding generations. An affair of great con&s;equence to the health and well-being of &s;ucceeding ones! and this by a method, whereby alone it can be di&s;charged. It is often got to &s;uch a degree of tenacity, as to be inca|pable of being &s;ecreted, by the emuncto|ries of the body; not even by the action of a fever. In this di&s;ea&s;e it is deter|mined to the &s;urface of the body, and, in a peculiar manner, eliminated and di&s;|charged. Health &s;ucceeds, and that often to a degree inexperienced before.</P>
<P>Hereby nature has a chance of being re&s;tored to a &s;tate of perfection, in &s;ome mea&s;ure adequate to its fir&s;t &s;tate, with re&s;pect to purity of the blood. The con|&s;equence of which, with regard to the beneficial effects of health, to the per|&s;ons them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity, I leave to the judicious to determine.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="19">
<P>It cannot indeed be denied, that this di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes makes dreadful havock, in tho&s;e bodies, in whom, the before-mentioned vi&s;cid, putre&s;cent, &s;corbutic matter predominates, e&s;pecially in hot climates, and in con&s;titutions of the air productive of putrid di&s;orders; when, by rea&s;on of abounding untoward matter and the putre&s;cence thereby occa&s;ioned, or when, on account of great weakne&s;s, nature cannot bring about, her main work, the maturation of the pu&s;tules. Nor that, when the di&s;ea&s;e does not prove fatal, there are wanting in&s;tances of imperfect recovery, where &s;he does thus meet with &s;uch ob&s;tacles, that &s;he cannot &s;urmount. The&s;e are however no contradiction of the original rectitude of tho&s;e laws, whereby the di&s;ea&s;e acts. And wi&s;e indeed mu&s;t he be, who can find out any, re&s;pecting the reception and expul&s;ion of di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uperior, on the whole, to tho&s;e which are original.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the proce&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation, the imperfect depuration generally attend|ing it, and the effects and di&s;ea&s;es that frequently follow.</HEAD>
<P>IN this method, the matter is indeed ab&s;orbed into the blood, by a wound made in the &s;kin; but undoubtedly it is &s;oon after al&s;o received in, by the breath likewi&s;e. For how is it po&s;&s;ible, the ef|fluviae of matter &s;o contagious, which is al&s;o again di&s;charged by the wound, and by which, the di&s;ea&s;e may, in the &s;ame manner, be communicated to others, &s;hould not be received in by the breath of the per&s;on, out of who&s;e arm it i&s;&s;ues?</P>
<P>Be that as it may; the effort of nature, in expelling it, is here twofold. A de|termination is made of the matter, to|wards the wound, whereat it was re|ceived,
<PB N="11" REF="21">and al&s;o to the &s;kin. Hereby is perverted that powerful and uniform de|termination of the matter of the di&s;ea&s;e, after one manner only, as in the natural &s;mall-pox. And certainly, the apparent difference, of inoculation, from the na|tural di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in reducing the ex|pul&s;ive fever in the former, under that which would take place in the latter, in the &s;ame body, with the &s;ame quantity of heterogeneous, unhealthful matter, to be di&s;charged; whether it ari&s;es, from thus baffling the effort of nature, by the double determination above-mentioned, the inflammation and di&s;charge attend|ing the wound beforehand, or any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The general con&s;equence is imperfect depuration, even though the pu&s;tules that appear maturate kindly; which, notwith|&s;tanding the per&s;on recovers, is productive of many bad con&s;equences.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="22">
<P>If there is any tolerable &s;trength in the per&s;on, and the juices are not extraordi|narily vi&s;cid, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;ual are impo&s;thumations; or a tendency of di&s;ea&s;ed &s;erous and lymphatic humours to the &s;kin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am far from thinking with &s;ome gentlemen, who practi&s;e inoculation, that it is good to avoid either of the&s;e con&s;equences, in ca&s;es where it hap|pens that nature has not properly relieved her&s;elf, by the preceding di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE>, which often degenerates into a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;corbutic di&s;order there.</P>
<P>If nature is not able to relieve her&s;elf in this way, &s;corbutic opthalmics en&s;ue, which often endanger the &s;ight; or the matter falls upon the lungs, and occa|&s;ions ob&s;tructions in the glands of that organ, which by degrees end in a tabes; e&s;pecially towards that critical term of life, when di&s;ea&s;es of that kind are apt to take place, in young per&s;ons. In others a &s;pitting of blood comes on, from the increa&s;ed heat and rarefaction occa&s;i|oned
<PB N="13" REF="23">therein, or ero&s;ions of the ve&s;&s;els brought on, by di&s;ea&s;ed, acrimonious hu|mours, never properly di&s;charged.</P>
<P>In women ob&s;truction of the men&s;es happens from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and &s;tru|mous tumours in the glands of the brea&s;t are occa&s;ioned, which degenerate into cancers, at a certain period. The&s;e hap|pen, where the matter de&s;cribed is apt to lye dormant, as it is generally inclined to do in weak, relaxed con&s;titutions; and therefore, in children, I have known the king's evil &s;ucceed: for let it be remem|bred, that tho' relaxation of the glands be now con&s;idered, as the chief cau&s;e of that dreadful malady; vi&s;cidity is often a predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e to relaxation, and al|ways co-operates with it.</P>
<P>Now, though I am mo&s;t ready to ac|knowledge, that inoculation is not to be con&s;idered as the &s;ole cau&s;e of many of the di&s;orders, which I have known &s;oon
<PB N="14" REF="24">con&s;equent, or could rea&s;onably trace, therefrom; yet, I cannot, without flying in the face of my rea&s;on, but remark, that it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be con&s;idered as in|&s;trumental, by preventing the beneficial effects of a di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o &s;alutary in its nature in general, to tho&s;e who recover from it.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections therefore lye again&s;t inoculation; even tho' the patients may have been treated after the mo&s;t judicious manner. I have known the&s;e con&s;equen|ces happen, in tho&s;e, who have been under the treatment of per&s;ons, of great reputed &s;kill in this branch, as well as in my own patients. And &s;o &s;en&s;ible I am of the bad effects of imperfect depuration of tenacious acrid matter, and e&s;pecially that which is tran&s;mitted, that I will venture to declare, any di&s;order may ari&s;e therefrom, even, from a &s;imple eruption on the &s;kin, to the king's evil, cancers, con&s;umption of the lungs, or the &s;low
<PB N="15" REF="25">nervous fever and atrophy; in which the &s;ubtle di&s;ea&s;ed effluviae attack and prey upon the fir&s;t principles of life.</P>
<P>Sorry I am to &s;ay it, and I wi&s;h I may be mi&s;taken; but the&s;e appear to me to be the con&s;equences of di&s;turbing and perverting the order of nature in her ope|rations, and aiming at a knowledge and power &s;uperior to that of the great Di&s;|po&s;er of things; who does not view things in that partial, contracted light we do; but looks forward, and has, I am of opi|nion, ordered every di&s;ea&s;e, in regard to the manner of its reception and expul&s;ion, &s;o as to be be&s;t on the whole, and for the benefit of his creatures.</P>

<P>THOUGH I cannot approve of in|oculation in the manner I could wi&s;h; it &s;hall not be &s;aid I am not wil|ling to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from what know|ledge I have therein, to bring it towards the be&s;t &s;tate, it is capable of attaining.</P>
<P>The be&s;t that can be &s;aid of inocula|tion is, that it is a means of preventing the mortality of the &s;mall-pox, which appears to be a very good plea for its u&s;e, when, on account of an unfavourable &s;tate of the air, we &s;ee numbers falling, on all &s;ides of us, a &s;acrifice to its mo&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="27">fatal effects. But that it can be equal, in its beneficial effects, to the natural di&s;ea&s;e, in tho&s;e who recover, unle&s;s it po&s;&s;ibly may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, take a more natural turn, is, I apprehend, in its own nature, impo&s;&s;ible. The laws of di&s;ea&s;es were given with them, and the nearer we keep to tho&s;e laws, on the &s;afer ground do we tread.</P>
<P>Inoculation will be brought neare&s;t, in its good effects, to the natural di&s;ea&s;e, by &s;o preparing the body, by diet and me|dicine, as to overcome, in a good mea|&s;ure, the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e, viz. tena|cious, acrid matter, to the bad effects the di&s;ea&s;e may have, without impairing the &s;trength, or the lea&s;t that is po&s;&s;ible. This is dividing the two extremes of no preparation at all, or of one which has but little efficacy; and of another, which brings down the &s;trength.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="28">
<P>By a gradual, proper, alterative prepa|ration, the blood will be reduced into &s;uch a &s;tate, by le&s;&s;ening and attenuating any tenacious humours therein, that the matter of the di&s;ea&s;e will be more ea&s;ily &s;eparated from it; and by pre&s;erving al&s;o the &s;trength, the effort of expul&s;ion will be more lively and effectual.</P>
<P>No preparation, or one that is ineffica|cious, are often bad, as they leave the humours too vi&s;cid, and the body too op|pre&s;&s;ed, for the morbid matter to be well &s;eparated from the blood. Which di&s;po|&s;ition, if it &s;hould not occa&s;ion any bad &s;ymptoms, during the di&s;ea&s;e, will be in great danger of &s;hewing it&s;elf afterwards, in the bad con&s;equences before-menti|oned.</P>
<P>Too much preparation, and violent do&s;es of mercurials, are bad on the other hand, as thereby the &s;trength is impaired, which is the chief in&s;trument in expel|ling
<PB N="19" REF="29">the di&s;ea&s;e. To which cau&s;e, with the heavy clog upon nature from the u&s;e of too much vi&s;cid diet, and the repul|&s;ion of the matter of the di&s;ea&s;e by cold air, are to be attributed the agues and putrid fevers, I have frequently ob&s;erved con&s;equent upon the modern method.</P>
<P>In the matter of preparation therefore, regard is to be had to the con&s;titution of the per&s;on, both in re&s;pect of the &s;olids and fluids; that the latter be not too te|nacious, and thereby hinder the &s;epara|tion from the blood; and that the former may be in &s;tate &s;ufficient, to give a lively and effectual impul&s;e to the morbid mat|ter, and to &s;upport the patient in the en|&s;uing di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>Of the be&s;t method of preparation, both before the natural and inoculated &s;mall-pox.</HEAD>
<P>CALOMEL, according to the pre|diction of the great Boerhaave, is the grand corrector, not of the variolous virus, but of that predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e, which occa&s;ions its mo&s;t dreadful effects, and the ba&s;is of the medicines now in u&s;e.</P>
<P>This, were it not now almo&s;t univer|&s;ally known, I might have &s;ome right to determine; having &s;een the extraordinary effects of it, in a practice commencing &s;o early as the year 1739, a period perhaps not many have a pretence to date from. I am therefore clear, that Dr. Ru&s;ton is right, in his experimental ob&s;ervations on Sutton's medicines; which is however, I believe, in general, not doubted.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="31">
<P>The method was at fir&s;t tried on three young per&s;ons, who afterwards received the &s;mall-pox, in the natural way, and had a favourable di&s;tinct kind, &s;ucceeded by an uninterrupted &s;tate of health, for &s;everal years after recovery.</P>
<P>It was afterwards confined within the narrow limits of the per&s;ons own friends and patients, who fir&s;t made u&s;e of it, and became the more confined, for want of that enterprizing and daring &s;pirit, which characterizes the modern race of inoculators. It was however communi|cated to &s;everal not long after.</P>
<P>Calomel and calx of antimony, joined with cream of tartar and purgatives of the bri&s;ker kind, as jalap and &s;cammony, were given as an alterative, in very &s;mall do&s;es every morning, &s;o as to move the bowels once daily, for a fortnight or three weeks before the natural di&s;ea&s;e; ab&s;taining, at the &s;ame time, from fle&s;h, and fermented, and other &s;trong liquors;
<PB N="22" REF="32">and going out daily, except in bad wea|ther.</P>
<P>This method I have &s;een attended with very great &s;ucce&s;s. It was made u&s;e of in preparation before the natural &s;mall-pox, in which it &s;carce ever failed of giving a di&s;tinct &s;ort, when the regimen pre&s;cribed with it was regularly per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>Its beneficial effects before inoculation, are al&s;o extraordinary, and I &s;till think it one of the be&s;t that can be u&s;ed for chil|dren, and young per&s;ons; but that &s;mall do&s;es of calomel joined with emetic tartar, or a preparation of antimony like James's powder, taken two or three nights toge|ther, and then purged off with Glauber &s;alt, repeating it at due di&s;tances, is pre|ferable for adults; e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a robu&s;t con&s;titution, and in the warmer &s;ea&s;ons of the year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This perfectly an&s;wers to Boerhaave's notion of the medicine, likely to correct, as he apprehended, the variolous virus.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="33">
<P>In patients to be inoculated, I never continued the method longer than to the time of inoculation; which I thought mo&s;t eligible, as it gave nature time to recruit, before the appearance of the di&s;|ea&s;e, and for the heat and di&s;turbance, occa&s;ioned by the mercurials, to &s;ub&s;ide. The original method however was to continue the medicines to the time of &s;eizure; which may be in &s;ome ca&s;es ne|ce&s;&s;ary, when per&s;ons are not &s;o &s;trict, in the ob&s;ervance of regimen, as they ought to be.</P>
<P>Let it be here ob&s;erved, that, as on the one hand, by this and other te&s;timo|nies, it cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that mer|curials have not an extraordinary u&s;e in preparation; and, as on the other, it has been objected, very ju&s;tly, by Mr. Brom|field, that by the pre&s;ent u&s;e of them, in large do&s;es, attended with a very lower|ing regimen, without &s;ufficient regard paid to the con&s;titution of the patient,
<PB N="24" REF="34">the &s;trength is often too much depre&s;&s;ed, and nature rendered unable to expel the di&s;ea&s;e, and perfect the maturation; that this method is a medium between both: and that a di&s;tinct pox by inoculation, expelled with ea&s;e, and coming kindly to maturation, as in the natural di&s;ea&s;e, is the almo&s;t infallible con&s;equence of the u&s;e of it.</P>

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the favourable ap|pearances above de&s;cribed, and the coming of the pu&s;tules kindly to matu|rity, yet from con&s;equences which have followed, I am fully a&s;&s;ured, that the work is not generally &s;o well done, as in the natural way; and that though the
<PB N="25" REF="35">enemy &s;hould lye dormant, and &s;eem quiet for a while; yet that, if he is not thoroughly conquered, he will certainly ri&s;e again, and commit dreadful havock and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>Let it be here remembered, that tran&s;|mitted and acquired &s;curvy, when joined to hereditary and acquired weakne&s;s, is to the body, what original &s;in is to the &s;oul, and will not fail &s;ooner or later to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Means may be u&s;ed to keep off and ward the blow. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, i&s;&s;ues continued in the inoculated parts, according to the old method, above all things will a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, and drain off any remaining matter, which is unfit for &s;e|cretion, and has probably received an in|crea&s;e of acrimony, from the variolous virus. To the&s;e &s;hould be joined, the alterative method u&s;ed in preparation for a &s;hort time; or crude antimony or &s;ome

<HEAD>Of the good and bad effects of cold air, and other anti&s;eptics, and the rea&s;onable man|ner of u&s;ing them; with &s;ome remarks on the pre&s;ent prevailing and peculiar method.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that air is one of the greate&s;t pre&s;ervatives of the blood and juices from putre&s;cence, while life &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; but does it thence follow, that the promi&s;cuous u&s;e of it, in &s;o free a manner, in all ca&s;es, in all &s;ea&s;ons, and in all periods of this di&s;ea&s;e, is there|fore advi&s;eable? Air has a repellent action upon the &s;urface of the body, as
<PB N="27" REF="37">well as is endued with a pre&s;ervative power. Therefore &s;uch indi&s;criminate and extraordinary u&s;e of it, as is too common with &s;ome, &s;avours but too &s;trongly of empirici&s;m, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Is there nothing to be done, but, after a &s;light fever, to check nature in the beginning of her work, by cold air and anti&s;eptics, and &s;et a&s;ide maturation, her &s;econd intention, as a matter of no con|&s;equence? or is it po&s;&s;ible mankind &s;hould be arrived at &s;uch total darkne&s;s of the under&s;tanding, in this, as is apprehended, mo&s;t enlightened age, as to &s;uppo&s;e they can trifle with and oppo&s;e original laws, without &s;marting &s;everely for it?&mdash;This is not copying after the great father of phy&s;ic, nor agreeable to his rules. For though it is the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of phy&s;ic, to relieve nature, when oppre&s;&s;ed, and le&s;&s;en her efforts, when too violent; I do a&s;k all who pretend to lay the lea&s;t claim
<PB N="28" REF="38">to medical erudition, if any thing can be &s;ub&s;tituted with equal propriety, in the place of tho&s;e known cri&s;es, whereby di&s;ea&s;es are terminated?</P>
<P>The &s;eeming recovery from the &s;mall-pox, is by no means a proof &s;ufficient; unle&s;s it can be likewi&s;e proved, that there is no other di&s;ea&s;e that can be fatal. I have my&s;elf known putrid purgings, putrid fevers with &s;ore throats, with in|flammation of the lungs, and ob&s;tinate in|termittents, following hard upon the heels of a celebrated method: Ari&s;ing, I have the weakne&s;s to apprehend, from the rarified, putrid matter of the &s;mall-pox, unexpelled by maturation; the oppre&s;&s;ive load upon nature, from vi&s;cid diet, joined with the relaxation brought on by large do&s;es of mercurials.</P>
<P>I hope Dr. Dim&s;dale will not take it ami&s;s, if I &s;ay, that the ca&s;e he has &s;o candidly related, in his treati&s;e on the
<PB N="29" REF="39" MS="y">&s;mall-pox, page 137, of the man who died of an apoplexy, upon recovery from inoculation, mo&s;t probably aro&s;e from matter unexpelled, determined to and affecting the head; though under a treat|ment more judicious, than what I have above recited.</P>
<P>The public is greatly indebted to that gentleman, for communicating the good effects air and mercurial purges may have, in repre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t fever of the con|fluent &s;mall-pox, in violent and dange|rous ca&s;es. They undoubtedly le&s;&s;en the putridity con&s;equent in the following &s;tages; and may, under judicious ma|nagement, be a great means of pre&s;erving life.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o of circulating air through the chambers of the &s;ick, in all &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, as well as of taking them, at times, out of bed, according to Sydenham's method; of even letting in|oculated
<PB N="30" REF="40">per&s;ons walk about the hou&s;e in the warm &s;ea&s;on of the year; and indeed all methods of u&s;ing air, agreeable to right rea&s;on and experience, are al&s;o abundantly apparent. But &s;urely the in|di&s;crimate u&s;e of it, in &s;uch degree, as is common, in all ca&s;es, in all &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, and in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, in this climate, is an extreme, which may be too ju&s;tly &s;tiled the madne&s;s and en|thu&s;ia&s;m of modern phy&s;ic! and to its account may be fairly &s;et, tho&s;e con&s;e|quences before enumerated, as attendant on imperfect depuration of the blood.</P>

<HEAD>THE APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IT is pretty univer&s;ally agreed, that the &s;mall-pox did not make its appearance very early in the world, as neither Hip|pocrates nor Cel&s;us take any notice of it. If this is the ca&s;e, and mo&s;t probable it appears; as I will not allow that things of that kind happen in the world by chance, I cannot help forming this infe|rence; that, at the time of its fir&s;t ap|pearance, there was a real nece&s;&s;ity for it, either in a phy&s;ical or moral &s;en&s;e, and mo&s;t probably in both.</P>
<P>The former nece&s;&s;ity could be occa&s;i|oned by nothing el&s;e, than the increa&s;ing corruption of tran&s;mitted or acquired &s;curvy or impurity of the blood, and its
<PB N="32" REF="42">mi&s;chievous effects, ari&s;ing from intem|perance; and the latter, by degeneracy of manners.</P>
<P>In regard to the former, it is humbly conceived, that the mo&s;t wi&s;e and mer|ciful Di&s;po&s;er of things, would not have laid this &s;evere &s;courge upon intempe|rance, without having &s;till farther therein a merciful view, in the re&s;toration and pre&s;ervation of the human &s;y&s;tem to future ages, in that &s;tate of perfection, it is &s;till &s;een, in a wonderful manner, capable of attaining in many in&s;tances; con&s;idering the many removes which have happened from that purity of blood, and that &s;trength which were original.</P>
<P>That the &s;mall-pox, among other cau&s;es, has had a great &s;hare in this miraculous pre&s;ervation and re&s;toration, whereby the humam &s;y&s;tem has been ca|pable, like the phoenix, of often ri&s;ing again, as it were, out of its own a&s;hes,
<PB N="33" REF="43">is not to be doubted. To this end, pro|vidence has appointed laws of an infal|lible propriety, re&s;pecting the manner of the reception and expul&s;ion of di&s;ea&s;es; wherewith, &s;o far as men co-operate, they proceed right; as they re&s;i&s;t, wrong. In the foregoing pages, I have already con&s;idered the matter of hereditary and acquired impurity of the blood, and what the &s;mall-pox has to do with it; at lea&s;t, in the natural way.</P>
<P>The latter is perhaps a &s;ubject of too delicate a nature to touch upon, and may al&s;o appear foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Suffice it therefore to &s;ay, that, though it is certainly right to alleviate and take off any of the &s;evere effects of di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o far at lea&s;t as we can do it to good purpo&s;e; it is undoubtedly a great error, that the &s;mall-pox is now con&s;idered, as the only bugbear in the whole li&s;t of di&s;|ea&s;es, which, if people can but get over, they think they are &s;afe. Whereas the
<PB N="34" REF="44">mortality, attending the &s;mall-pox, makes but a &s;mall part in the general deva&s;ta|tion occa&s;ioned by di&s;ea&s;es. It is cer|tainly wrong to in&s;til into and encourage &s;uch notions, in young minds. Tempe|rance is the &s;ure&s;t guard again&s;t the bad effects of di&s;ea&s;es in general, and of this in particular; for without regimen, pre|paration it&s;elf would avail but little.</P>
<P>Permit me now to addre&s;s &s;ome very peculiar inoculators.</P>
<P>Let it be laid down as a fundamental rule for all hone&s;t men to proceed by, never to per&s;uade any one into the u&s;e of inoculation. For, as the con&s;equence is to them and theirs, it ought to be their own act, and they &s;hould be &s;atisfied in their own minds, that what they are doing is right. This will be a &s;ure means of avoiding reflections afterwards, and prevent that unea&s;ine&s;s I have been witne&s;s to, even where a celebrated me|thod
<PB N="35" REF="45">has been &s;ucceeded by di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Much le&s;s let any pre&s;ume to declare, there is no danger attending even the be&s;t methods, as long as they would claim a pretence to believe, that we are in the hands of providence. It al&s;o well de&s;erves &s;erious con&s;ideration, how far it may be right and humane, to turn patients loo&s;e, and thereby drive all people into the u&s;e of a method, in a manner, whether they will or not.</P>
<P>Let me al&s;o join with Mr. Bromfield in de&s;iring, that if they have, at any time, found their method wrong, they would take the hint, alter it, and have regard not only to pre&s;ent, but future con&s;equences. For, whether it is allowed or no, the following of putrid fevers, &amp;c. on the heels of any method, is a &s;hrewd &s;ign of its in&s;ufficiency and inefficacy. It, in fact, requires more judgment, than
<PB N="36" REF="46">&s;ome are perhaps aware of, &s;o to order things unnatural, as to an&s;wer the great purpo&s;es of the Author of nature.</P>
<P>If any thing herein written &s;hall ap|pear too har&s;h, or &s;eem too hard to be dige&s;ted by our frail nature; let it be at|tributed to that hone&s;t and generous warmth, which is due to &s;ubjects of an important kind. Let it al&s;o be remem|bered, that, out of regard to the lives of my fellow-creatures, I have allowed of inoculation, as a &s;uccedaneum to prevent the mortality of the &s;mall-pox, under proper re&s;trictions, good management, and a re&s;pect to future con&s;equences; though, I declare, I am not clear in my own mind, that it will be attended with good in general. For, if lingering evils be of all evils the wor&s;t, the point is nice to decide on, and of weighty concern. That I have communicated a method, which, notwith&s;tanding the ba&s;is of it is now pretty univer&s;ally known, has a peculi|arity
<PB N="37" REF="47">belonging to it, in the manner of admini&s;tration, that brings the effects of inoculation, neare&s;t to tho&s;e of the di|&s;tinct natural kind, of any thing yet made known; and injures the &s;tamina le&s;s, than the common method of admini&s;ter|ing mercurials.</P>
<P>As I plead a long and pretty con&s;ider|able experience, though not &s;o exten&s;ive as that of &s;ome others, as well as a &s;trict attention paid to the &s;ubject, and a faith|ful relation of facts; let the&s;e pages be turned over and again, before any one ra&s;hly declares again&s;t what is therein contained. If people are determined to &s;tick to their own &s;hort&s;ighted views, had any one the knowledge of the whole truth of this &s;ubject, it would not avail.</P>
<P>For my own part, having long revolved in my mind the &s;entiments, ari&s;ing from rea&s;on and experience, herein contained, it would be ju&s;t neither to my&s;elf or
<PB N="36" REF="48"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="37" REF="49"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="38" REF="50">others, totally to &s;uppre&s;s them. There|fore, as the time now is of thoroughly examining this important &s;ubject, I have with fidelity declared them. And I heartily wi&s;h that method may take place, which will mo&s;t conduce to the general good; which undoubtedly will be the ca&s;e, if men will proceed upon firm and &s;table principles.</P>
