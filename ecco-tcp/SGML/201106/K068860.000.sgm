<HEAD>A PRACTICAL DISPLAY OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM CALLED Animal Magneti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to make this u&s;eful Science as plain as po&s;&s;ible, every thing that has not an im|mediate Connection with the practical part of it, is omitted, that the young Practitioner may not be confu&s;ed with the Subject; and I am fully per|&s;uaded, that, by attending to the Directions here
<PB N="6" REF="4">given, any one may attain to a &s;ufficient knowledge of the Science to enable him to practi&s;e it for the Benefit of him&s;elf and others, as well as tho&s;e who have obtained it at the Price of Twenty or Twenty-five Guineas.</P>
<P>In order to treat a Patient with Succe&s;s, the fol|lowing Qualifications are e&s;&s;entially Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Ab&s;traction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Affection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Intention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV Volition.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Ab&s;traction. Be as much ab&s;tracted as po&s;&s;ible, forget your&s;elf and every thing around you, and take a kind of temporary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Object to be treated.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>Affection. Let your Affection and Benevolence go forth towards the Object you are about to treat, let the whole energy of your Mind be fixed on the Patient's Relief, and almo&s;t certain Succe&s;s will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Intention. Keep up a con&s;tant Idea of the Com|plaint you wi&s;h to remove, let your Intention be to admini&s;ter all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance in your Power to|wards the Patient's Recovery; Compa&s;&s;ion and In|tention will contribute much to the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Volition. The Human Sy&s;tem being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mental Faculties who&s;e active Power is unknown 'till it is demon&s;trated by practical Operations; exert all the Volition you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed off, with a Determination, if po&s;&s;ible, to do good to the
<PB N="8" REF="6">Object you are treating, and you will often find a kind of contacting Sen&s;ation, effected by the In|corporation of Atmo&s;pheres and the powerful Prin|ciples of the Science acting upon each Body; and the greater the Exertion of tho&s;e Principles the more effectual will the Treatment be.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the different Modes of Treating.</HEAD>
<P>Several Modes have been practi&s;ed, but I &s;hall only mention Two, which will be quite &s;ufficient for the Purpo&s;e, one by the Science it&s;elf, without the U&s;e of the Hands, (for it is a mental Act, and the &s;tronger the mental Powers the more efficaicous will the Treatment be.) Here ab&s;tract your&s;elf, be quite placid and &s;erene, keep up your Intention, and put forth all the Volition you are Ma&s;ter off: By this Means I have &s;een a Hand rai&s;ed quite erect that lay pa&s;&s;ive on a Table,
<PB N="9" REF="7">without any Action whatever; but let me here ob&s;erve, le&s;t by failing in your fir&s;t Attempt, you &s;hould be di&s;couraged, a Per&s;on who will be faith|ful to you, that is to &s;ay, who will make no re&s;i&s;t|ance, &s;hould be cho&s;en, and the more delicate the Per&s;on the more ea&s;ily will this Operation be per|formed. Whatever the Ca&s;e you are about to treat may be, be not di&s;heartened, nor weary, if your &s;anguine Expections &s;hould not, at fir&s;t, be fully an&s;wered, but per&s;evere, make repeated Trials, the more you practice the greater will be your Confidence, and the more &s;ucce&s;sful your Treatment.</P>
<P>The other Mode of treating I &s;hall here men|is, by U&s;e of the Hands with the Science, for there mu&s;t be a concurrence with each other, the Hands will give a kind of energy to the Mind, and keep the Operator to his Work. The Effect of this will &s;oon be perceived in the Patient, and
<PB N="10" REF="8">al&s;o by your&s;elf, in the Patient the Effects may &s;ometimes be different, but in general a warm Sen|&s;ation will take place, at other times the Patient will feel cold; and the Operator will find a &s;ort of pricking in the the Ends of all his Fingers.&mdash; So much for the Mode of Treating.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be attended to is &s;ome of the Complaints the Human Body is &s;ubject to, and which the Operation of this Science is peculiarly adapted to remove; many Di&s;orders ari&s;e from Ob&s;tructions and the want of proper Circulation of the Fluids: the Body is like a curious Machine, which if one Wheel be a little ob&s;tructed, it affects the Whole and when the Di&s;order is di&s;covered the Remedy is the more ea&s;ily applied; &s;o when any Ob&s;truction is perceived, apply the whole Energy of the mind to the part affected, and in this, as well as every other Magnetic Operation, &s;eparate as
<PB N="11" REF="9">much as po&s;&s;ible, every Idea of corporal Action and think on mental Power only.</P>
<P>Head-Ach. Whatever ob&s;tructs the free Circu|lation of the Blood through the Ve&s;&s;els of the Head, may occa&s;ion the Head-ach, which very frequently ari&s;es from a foul Stomach; in that ca&s;e you mu&s;t treat the Stomach only, by moving the Hand upwards and downwards, which will agitatate the Bile, and relieve the Patient; but if it ari&s;es from Ob&s;tructions, the Treatment will occa&s;ion an agreeable warmth, and a&s;&s;i&s;t Na|ture in overcoming the complaint; this will be found effectual in mo&s;t Di&s;orders of the Head. I have frequently cured the Head-ach, by pre&s;&s;ing and drawing the Hand &s;teadily over the Forehead, in le&s;s than half an hour.</P>
<P>Inflammation of the eyes, may be cured by this Treatment, only ob&s;erve (during the Operation
<PB N="12" REF="10">with the Hand) to exert your Intention, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to draw out the Inflammation: By the &s;ame method you may treat Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in order to bring them to a head, if you cannot di&s;per&s;e them; likewi&s;e you will find it effectual to extract Fire from burns of all kinds, in two or three times treating, and if not very much burnt, in one Treat|ment only.</P>
<P>Strains. In treating Strains, which are often at|tended with wor&s;e con&s;equences than broken Bones; fix your Mind inten&s;ely on the part affect|ed, and while you are engaged in the method of Treatment, as above, the Patient will find an agreeable glow and warmth pervade the part, which will help to re&s;tore the Ve&s;&s;els to their proper Tone.</P>
<P>Deafne&s;s. The hearing may be hurt by violent Colds in the Head, by a Stroke upon the Ear, by
<PB N="13" REF="11">hard Wax, or other Sub&s;tances, filling up the Cavity of the Ear, all which may be removed by per&s;everance in the Treatment. Place the Patient at a little di&s;tance, with the Ear inclining towards you: Let your mental Ideas enter the Ear, at the &s;ame time moving your Hands backwards and forwards, pointing towards the Ear, and carry your Ideas, as it were, through the Head; and by a con|tinuance of this Treatment, an agreeable warmth will be produced, and the Ob&s;truction removed. I have known a Deafne&s;s occa&s;ioned by a &s;troke on the Ear, to have been totally removed in a quarter of an Hour; and Per&s;ons who had been Deaf for many Years, have been re&s;tored to their Hearing by repeated Treatments of this Kind; but great care mu&s;t be taken not to catch Cold whil&s;t the Cure is performing, le&s;t it &s;hould render the Treatment ineffectual.</P>
<P>WE now advance to another part of the Sci|ence,
<PB N="14" REF="12">that of ab&s;ent Treatment, and here it ap|pears in a more irrational and ob&s;cure point of view, to ignorant and prejudiced minds;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ironical, dogmatical, and not to &s;ay immode&s;t Pamphlet, has been recently impo&s;ed on the Public for a rational account of Animal Magneti&s;m, the Editor of which &s;eems to have attained to no better knowledge of the Science he explodes, than what has been imbibed from Vulgar Prejudice, and the Cant of a few old Women.</NOTE> but why &s;hould this be thought incredible, &s;ince Expan&s;ion or Di&s;tance is allowed to be a relative Idea, which belongs only to the Body, and has nothing to do with the Soul; the Soul is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with inte|lectual Powers and Affections, &s;uch as Thought, Reflection, Sen&s;ation, Volition or Willing, and I can as ea&s;ily fix my Mind upon St. Peter's at Rome as on St. Paul's in London. Di&s;tance be|longs to the Body, as ob&s;erved above, but Thought cannot be confined, it can travel backward into the pa&s;t, or forward into the future, it can a&s;pire to things above as well as reflect on things beneath; when we want to recollect any thing we travel back into the pa&s;t, we exerci&s;e a wi&s;h to recollect,
<PB N="15" REF="13">and often our wi&s;hes are effectual and the thing we want to recollect is brought to our Mind: Thoughts are in many ca&s;es, influencial, why may they not affect and remove Di&s;orders from Per|&s;ons at a di&s;tance, as well as tho&s;e at hand?&mdash; In order to perform ab&s;ent Treatment, retire; &s;it down for a few Minutes, be perfectly collected, and as much as po&s;&s;ible ab&s;tracted; con&s;ider the Powers you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed off, and what you wi&s;h to perform to your ab&s;ent Friend, form his Idea in your Mind, fix on it for &s;ome time, and de&s;cend &s;lowly and gradually from the Head downwards, 'till by the power of Sympathy you feel your&s;elf, as it were, in contact with him and find a corre&s;|pondent Pain which you mu&s;t endeavor to remove: But if you know the Complaint your ab&s;ent Friend labours under, and would relieve him, &s;it down, collect your&s;elf, and then treat him, though ab&s;ent, in the &s;ame Manner you would if you &s;aw him be|fore you.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<P>IF upon reading the&s;e Lines the Science &s;hould appear a Chimera, the Reader is reque&s;ted not to cen&s;ure and condemn it 'till he has tried the Power of it for his own Satisfaction and Conviction, and if he finds it effectual in one Ca&s;e, let him &s;u&s;pend his judgement 'till he has tried it in others, and I am per&s;uaded he will not be di&s;appointed. Let him make Trial of rai&s;ing the Hand as directed in the Mode of Treatment, and he will have occular De|mon&s;tration of the Power of the Science.</P>
