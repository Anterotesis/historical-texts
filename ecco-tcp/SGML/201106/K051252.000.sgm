<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>INNUMERABLE are the agents which di&s;turb our health, and make us liable to a wonderful variety of di&s;orders and di&s;ea&s;es; and it has ever been the bu&s;ine&s;s of the good Phy&s;ician to exert his application, &s;tudy, and diligence, in propor|tion to their danger and malignancy&mdash;Phy&s;icians, I &s;ay, who&s;e lives are occupied in de&s;troying the exi&s;ting cau&s;es of the different maladies to which we are &s;ubject, and of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the good order of the animal economy, are certainly the mo&s;t noble portion of &s;ociety, the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and (as Cicero has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf) "Who neare&s;t approach the Divinity."</P>
<P>Cutaneous Eruptions, although an affection &s;o very general, an affection, common to all ages, all con&s;titutions, all cities and countries, have, from the enlightened, received little more than mere theoretical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and thus, unhappily they are not even yet, advanced a long way in this branch of their art.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The only rea&s;on of their not having made progre&s;s in this part of the &s;cience, ari&s;es from an error, which, till lately, was univer&s;ally adopt|ed concerning the ORIGIN of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Every one &s;eemed &s;ure that a vice did exi&s;t in the blood, which when carried to the &s;urface of the body, produced the different morbific appear|ances: and each, as vainly endeavoured to deter|mine the CHARACTER and QUALITIES of this imaginary vice; their labours were nece&s;&s;a|rily abortive, and, as will ever be the ca&s;e where the criterion cannot be found, a variety of opinions nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e.</P>
<P>From the&s;e erroneous and fal&s;e principles they deduced their medical indications, or, in other terms, their method of cure; and the&s;e methods were not <HI>unique,</HI> but as numerous and as diffe|rent, as had been their particular opinions: con|&s;equently, by pur&s;uing the FALSE, the true means were neglected. This accounts for their back|wardne&s;s and univer&s;al want of &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e complaints.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is now different; I &s;ay different, be|cau&s;e in tho&s;e latter times Phy&s;icians have known, that the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin, are a local affection, produced by a depraved and altered &s;ecretion of the extreme arterial ve&s;&s;els, or, the cutaneous glands, which are in a PRETERNATURAL STATE: con&s;equently, this knowledge has led them to
<PB N="5" REF="4">attempt the cure, with topical, or external medi|cines. The effects have often corre&s;ponded with their expectation; but often al&s;o, their expecta|tions have been fru&s;trated, for want of a SPE|CIFIC REMEDY.</P>
<P>Experience only could bring forward this &s;pe|cific, which Phy&s;icians, by &s;imple rea&s;oning alone, never could di&s;cover.</P>
<P>As all new doctrines in medicine amount to an impeachment of, and directly militate again&s;t, the judgment and practice of the day in which they are propo&s;ed; they have therefore, not only men's prejudices to encounter, but al&s;o their pride; and frequently, nothing but the determination of the patients them&s;elvs can make their adoption general: this was particularly in&s;tanced in the in|troduction of the Bark, Inoculation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Mr. Gowland, as Apothecary to the Three Royal Hou&s;eholds, was particularly favourable, and gave more frequent occa&s;ion to his experience in the complaints of which we are about to &s;peak, than mo&s;t others; and he lau|dably availed him&s;elf at an early &s;tage of this doctrine, with that alertne&s;s, and ob&s;ervation, which eventually produced the &s;pecific in que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>He had ob&s;erved the treatment employed on Mi&s;s Chudleigh, by the Phy&s;icians under who&s;e care &s;he was, and the inefficacy, with which it was
<PB N="6" REF="5">attended; and <HI>although</HI> his Lotion was not admi|ni&s;tered, until their efforts had failed of &s;ucce&s;s, its wonderful effects went beyond his own, or even his patient's hopes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a more particular account &s;ee the Proprietor's Eleemo&s;ynary Pamphlet.</NOTE>. This fact alone, was not &s;ufficient to canonize the Lotion and en|&s;ure to it the reputation of SPECIFIC: but a long u&s;e, a &s;crutinizing and judicious ob&s;erva|tion, was further nece&s;&s;ary. The fact, how|ever, being known, a great number of afflicted per&s;ons, the more readily concurred to try the remedy. This afforded him the opportunity of verifying and e&s;tabli&s;hing, the va&s;t power of his Lotion, and at the &s;ame time, was the mo&s;t complete defence of his doctrine and his repu|tation, again&s;t the invidious attacks of tho&s;e in|tere&s;ted men of his time, who&s;e practice it &s;o di|rectly militated again&s;t.</P>
<P>This happy di&s;covery of Mr. Gowland's has been much more intere&s;ting, and more u&s;eful to mankind, than all the volumes written to this day upon Eruptions of the Skin, as they contain no|thing but Theories, and have always been defec|tive in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part, namely, THE MAN|NER OF CURING, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is not enough to SPEAK well upon di&s;ea&s;es; the thing more important is to RELIEVE them.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>This recalls to my recollection, the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e two Greek &s;culptors, who were called by the Senate, in order to learn from them, how they would execute a &s;tatue which might be allu&s;ive to an hero of Greece, and erect it to his glory. One of them made a long di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;howed him to have an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, and proved, that he was completely ma&s;ter, at lea&s;t of the theory of his art: as he fini&s;hed, the opinion of the other was required; he an&s;wered in a few words, "I will DO what my colleague has SAID;" and he was cho&s;en by the Senate, becau&s;e they de&s;ired THE WORK, and not a di&s;&s;ertation upon the work.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that many Phy&s;icians have &s;poken with more elegance and eloquence, upon the impurities of the &s;kin than Mr. Gowland has done&mdash;but Mr. Gowland RELIEVED HIS PA|TIENTS.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only advantage enjoyed by him; it will appear, by this e&s;&s;ay, that he was ac|quainted with the true cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The many rea&s;ons and proofs, which both de|mon&s;trate his knowledge, and the truth of the doctrine, have received additional weight, from having &s;ince appeared, in the works of the mo&s;t enlightened Phy&s;icians of the pre&s;ent day, and which prove incontrovertibly, that the cutaneous affections are mere LOCAL affections.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented that medical works are
<PB N="8" REF="7">chiefly confined to the readings of medical men; and of cour&s;e, however indi&s;pen&s;able and whole|&s;ome, the doctrine may be, are therefore never thoroughly di&s;&s;eminated, e&s;pecially, when re|pugnant to the general con&s;umption of medi|cine. How far that has been the ca&s;e in what has formerly been written on this &s;ubject, is left to the di&s;cernment of the reader. This remark, however, may be made, that, the u&s;e of a Topical Remedy, in cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t entirely &s;u|per&s;ede the u&s;e of internal medicine for the&s;e complaints; from its plea&s;antne&s;s, ea&s;e, and cer|tainty of cure. Hence &s;ome oppo&s;ition may be expected from the &s;elfi&s;h as well as the ignorant: characters unhappily too common, even in this profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;characters, on whom the remark of CICERO &s;hould be rever&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There exi&s;ts in this country a very vulgar, but at the &s;ame time a very univer&s;al error, re&s;pecting the term <HI>Humour;</HI> it is never u&s;ed, or thought of, but we have an idea of virus or acrimony: whereas the term literally means a fluid, and this fluid is as likely to be good as bad; the blood it&s;elf is a humour; there is al&s;o a fluid or humour of the pericar|dium, and of all cavities, fit and nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the vi&s;cera, &amp;c. from friction, and many others: the&s;e are not morbid or vicious, but ab|&s;olutely GOOD.
<P>The only place in which the term is generally properly under&s;tood is when we &s;peak of the humidity of the weather, meaning a dampne&s;s in the air: here the idea is ju&s;t, &s;ee any dictionary. "HUMOUR, Wet, Moi&s;t, Watery.&mdash;HUMIDITY, Moi&s;ture.&mdash;HUMID, Moi&s;ture, Wa|tery, &amp;c." And thus the ignorance of charlatans; I &s;ay the ignorance of &s;ome, and the wickedne&s;s of others, in di&s;torting this &s;en&s;ele&s;s term merely to frighten or alarm us thereby into a cour&s;e of u&s;ele&s;s internal medicine, and in&s;tead of forwarding, to deter us from the only means of cure: falls beneath our pity, and are de&s;ervedly objects of our abhor|rence and contempt.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>In the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay the term SECRE|TION is of nece&s;&s;ity often u&s;ed:&mdash;on a thorough knowledge, and indeed, intimate acquaintance with this term, and the exact meaning of it in its fulle&s;t extent, depends all the information the reader can gain; and in proportion to his ac|quaintance therewith, will be his information, and acquaintance with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By the term &s;ecretion people generally under|&s;tand no more than certain &s;ecreted fluids, or mat|ters; without con&s;idering AT ALL, the organs that produce them, or the power of tho&s;e organs, to alter their properties, from a natural &s;tate, and according to the circum&s;tances, impre&s;s them with new characters, and frequently characters of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>By the term SECRETION, phy&s;iologi&s;ts under|&s;tand a particular operation, performed by the extremities of arterial ve&s;&s;els, from which re&s;ults a new animal product, or in other terms, a fluid which is furni&s;hed with new characters and pro|perties, <HI>("&s;ui generis")</HI> and of their own di&s;tinct kind: for in&s;tance, the bile is elaborated in the liver, and is not in the blood, nor are its cha|racters to be found in any other part of the hu|man body. Again, the fat is not in the blood,
<PB N="10" REF="9">but the arteries, which terminate in the cellular membrane, elaborate and compo&s;e it by a &s;ecret and inimitable combination of principles: the poi&s;on of vipers is not found in the ma&s;s of their fluids, (on the contrary they are very innocent) but it is created by particular organs endowed with that power.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to all the &s;ecre|tions, particularly that which takes place and is performed in the &s;kin, or &s;urface of the body, CALLED PERSPIRATION.</P>
<P>The&s;e operations are them&s;elves very &s;urpri&s;|ing and difficult to be under&s;tood, it is however, enough to know the effects, and the&s;e effects are, as has been ob&s;erved, generally, of their own pro|per and natural kind.</P>
<P>Nor is this doctrine confined to animals alone, it is the &s;ame in greens, plants, and flowers them|&s;elves; their different colours, &s;mell, ta&s;te, &amp;c. are from a &s;pecific combination of parts, the con|&s;equence of different &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>Since then the EARTH, from which they have their nouri&s;hment, has not in it&s;elf, ALL the dif|ferent principles, qualities, &s;alts, and juices, which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;o it is nece&s;&s;ary to al|low, that this combination, is the re&s;ult of the ve&s;|&s;els of tho&s;e vegetables, adapted to an inherent power in them, the &s;ame as the &s;ecretions of ani|mals: and if it is ab&s;urd to a&s;&s;ert (as it certainly
<PB N="11" REF="10">is) that the&s;e different products and matters exi&s;t READY PERFORMED in the earth; &s;o it &s;hould be equally ab&s;urd to think that the different &s;ecreted fluids in animals exi&s;t READY PERFORMED, or that their characters, are in the BLOOD.</P>
<P>In the peru&s;al of this little work, the intelli|gent reader, it is pre&s;umed, will find rea&s;oning and fact founded on reflection and experiment, agreeing with the true&s;t principles of the art, and not on &s;imple &s;peculation: nor is it doubted but the truth and candour of Mr. Gowland's E&s;&s;ay will entitle his Specific to that confidence which the experience of fifty years, and the te&s;timony of thou&s;ands, in the fir&s;t ranks of &s;ociety, have proved it to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THAT the following Pages had been intended for Pub|lication by Mr. GOWLAND in his life-time, is evident:&mdash; why it did not take place, we are at a lo&s;s to &s;urmi&s;e. They were found among other MS. papers after his death, and have been &s;ubmitted in that manu&s;cript to a Gentleman, who, from his philanthropy and medical talents, is an orna|ment and a ble&s;&s;ing to the Country in which he lives. The truth of the doctrine, he declared was &s;uch, and withal &s;o little known, that he &s;hould regret extremely if it was with|held. This ob&s;ervation determined the pre&s;ent Proprietors of his &s;pecific, on its publication, and they conceive they are doing no more than their duty, to the public, and to them|&s;elves, in demon&s;trating al&s;o, that this remedy has not &s;uf|fered any diminution, or lo&s;t any of its virtues, in its mi&s;&s;ion from the inventor's hand to their's; in proof of which, they here adduce the following general te&s;timony:</P>

<HEAD>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es, the Eruption of the Skin is one affection, the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> common, and, at the &s;ame time the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> dangerous: it is not preceded by any cau&s;es, capable of inducing a di&s;order in the animal economy, and tho&s;e who are thus afflicted always enjoy the be&s;t &s;tate of health. This excludes the idea of that humoral vice, to which &s;ome Phy&s;icians, a&s;cribe every di&s;order, when the cau&s;e thereof is unknown to them. Some learned Engli&s;h Phy&s;icians, how|ever, of the pre&s;ent day, have taken away the veil to this &s;pecies of impo&s;ture, and have brought to light the vacuum that did exi&s;t in the hy|pothe&s;is of humours; and yet, notwith&s;tanding their efforts, the &s;ame prejudices neverthele&s;s exi&s;t, and indeed, are almo&s;t general, from their works having been chiefly confined to the read|ing of medical men. The humouri&s;ts have ne|ver been able to &s;upport their opinion beyond the mo&s;t <HI>&s;imple conjecture,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t of which is, that the work of Chylification and Sanguifica|tion, or of Chyle and Blood, is often ill perform|ed,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and con&s;equently the fluids remove more or le&s;s from their natural &s;tate. One might an&s;wer the&s;e gentlemen, that if the aliments are not all converted into chyle, the lymphatics or lacteal ve&s;&s;els of the inte&s;tines do not ab&s;orb the remain|der, and that they refu&s;e admi&s;&s;ion to all matters which have either an <HI>acid</HI> or alkaline quality; that is, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els have a power of attracting what is proper for them, and of repelling what is not: thus their mouths become &s;hut the in&s;tant their outer extremities are approached by the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, and except to &s;ome violent medicines, open only to what is neutrali&s;ed and fit for nu|trition. In order to demon&s;trate this, we need but ob&s;erve, that there are always matters in the inte&s;tinal canal, which are naturally in a cor|rupted &s;tate, namely the re&s;idium of the chylifi|cation or excrements, and which, are refu&s;ed upon the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o in the inte&s;tines a quantity of gaz really mixed with the aliments and chyle; but this is never ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics in the pure &s;tate of gaz; I &s;ay <HI>never,</HI> becau&s;e if it &s;hould happen, immediate death would be the certain con&s;equence of &s;uch ab&s;orption: in fact, when this gaz, or ethereal fluid are injected into the cellular of the &s;kin, or into the ve&s;&s;els of any animal, the mo&s;t dreadful di&s;orders en&s;ue, and, in general, death it&s;elf. This has been demon&s;trated by the experiments of the Abbe Va&s;&s;alli. And,
<PB N="15" REF="14">as to the &s;anguification, it is demon&s;trated, that the <HI>atmo&s;phere</HI> makes this admirable proce&s;s,&mdash;changes and converts the fluids into animal &s;ub|&s;tances, and renders them proper for nutrition: it is for this rea&s;on, that in individuals who have a bad temperament or con&s;titution, the blood is as good, as in the mo&s;t robu&s;t, and healthy. This fine and precious ob&s;ervation, is made by Dr. Ballonius, the Hyppocrates of France.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o po&s;itive vital powers, in the life of the animal, which prevent the <HI>degenera|tion</HI> of humours, as is demon&s;trated by experi|ments and facts; from which it re&s;ults, that the circulating fluids, though they are <HI>not</HI> refre&s;hed by new aliments, pre&s;erve them&s;elves innocent. V. Haller Phy&s;iolog:&mdash;<HI>Tit de fame et Siti,</HI> &amp;c. And la&s;tly, many organs exi&s;t in the animal body, which continually purge and purify the ma&s;s of blood, if by any accident heterogeneous matter &s;hould intermix therewith: but without &s;topping any longer on this que&s;tion, I return to my &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that the Cutaneous Eruptions do not originate by any acrimony of the fluids: their proximate cau&s;e is an <HI>altered &s;ecretion,</HI> which takes place in the &s;kin.</P>
<P>That the per&s;piration be a &s;ecretion, <HI>&s;ui gene|ris,</HI> is a fact which wants no proof, and it would be ridiculous to doubt, and que&s;tion, upon any phy|&s;iological
<PB N="16" REF="15">point &s;o evident as this is. That <HI>every</HI> &s;ecretion is liable to be changed, and more or le&s;s altered, by a variety of circum&s;tances, there are many in&s;tances. Individuals who are &s;ea|&s;ick, often bring up a great quantity of bile, which is black and corro&s;ive, and is very far from being in a natural &s;tate. It al&s;o happens frequently that children when cutting their teeth have very fetid Diarrhoea, from the &s;timulus of the gums communicating with the inte&s;tines. It is an ob&s;ervation of Sydenham, that hy&s;terical women &s;ometimes vomit bilious and depraved matters, which did not exi&s;t before the paroxi&s;m in the &s;tomach nor in the bowels, but which had been &s;eparated during the paroxi&s;m it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame women, as well as in the hy|pochondriacal, when afflicted by their mala|dies, a very copious quantity of urine is in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;eparated, and it is as limpid and clear, as &s;pring water. This &s;ecretion is the &s;ure, or as Phy&s;icians &s;ay, the pathognomonicon &s;ign of this di&s;order. Sometimes fear alone will &s;ud|denly arre&s;t the men&s;trua; &s;ometimes anger will provoke an hemorrhage of the uterus.

<PB N="17" REF="16">and brought into circulation, excites &s;ome &s;e|rious or fatal di&s;orders. The &s;ecretion of the milk, by violent <HI>pathemata,</HI> or pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, has been on &s;everal occa&s;ions &s;topped, and it often happens that its qualities are changed and vitiated: in the la&s;t ca&s;e the child is violently purged, or affected with convul&s;ion-fits, and other indi&s;po&s;itions and di&s;orders. In a word, every organ, which nature has de&s;tined to perform any &s;ecretion, is &s;ubjected to the influence of the nerves, and as a certain con&s;equence receives and partakes of all the affections of this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Now nothing is more certain, than that tho&s;e organs, which are &s;upplied with the greate&s;t &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility, and which have a more intimate connection (let me &s;ay) with the nervous &s;y&s;tem, will &s;uffer more than other parts in exact propor|tion to the clo&s;ene&s;s of that connection. I will now a&s;k what part in the animal body, has &s;o much connection with, or dependence on the nerves, as the &s;kin? Certainly none. It is from the in|numerable quantity of nerves which are inter|&s;per&s;ed throughout, and actually terminate in the &s;kin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Anatomy of the Skin, page 25.</NOTE>, that <HI>this</HI> dependence and connection ex|i&s;ts, and thus it is that the anxieties, emotions, and troubles of the mind,&mdash;the morbific &s;tate of the vi&s;|cera, the tooth-ach, a bad dige&s;tion, and a hundred
<PB N="18" REF="17">other CAUSES, are capable of influencing the tran&s;piration, and thereby materially affecting the health of the &s;kin; be&s;ides, that the action of the atmo&s;phere mu&s;t be calculated, and con&s;idered, as one of the mo&s;t obvious, and powerful agents.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es la&s;t &s;poken of, do not always act; for in&s;tance, they do not act when the tone of the Cutaneous ve&s;&s;els is above the irritability of the mu&s;cular fibre; and &s;ometimes, although an im|pre&s;&s;ion be made upon tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, neverthele&s;s no eruption takes place, becau&s;e in this ca&s;e, the other &s;ecretions are augmented, in the &s;ame pro|portion, as the <HI>cutaneous</HI> &s;ecretion is dimini&s;hed: This is e&s;pecially ob&s;ervable in cold weather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every per&s;on mu&s;t have remarked in them&s;elves an unu&s;ual di&s;charge of urine under this circum&s;tance of cold.</NOTE>.

<P>Per&s;ons of an irritable temper, a great mobi|lity, a fine a delicate &s;kin, and a di&s;po&s;ition to the cutaneous eruptions, &s;uffer very much from the humidity and vici&s;&s;itudes of the air, and every kind of irritation. The animal powers in &s;uch individuals are very often in&s;ufficient to prevent the di&s;orders in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>One reflection ought here to be made; it is,
<PB N="19" REF="18">that a great number of per&s;ons are ignorant of the cau&s;e of their complaint, although it really exi&s;ts in them&s;elves; but where the cau&s;es are &s;o extremely numerous, it cannot be expected I &s;hould enumerate them all: yet in order to be under&s;tood, I &s;hall in&s;tance a few facts, and at the &s;ame time ob&s;erve, that the effects frequently remain, when the primary cau&s;e has cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are many women, who, in certain deli|cate circum&s;tances, are frequently troubled with efflore&s;cences, pimples, &amp;c. in their faces, hands, legs, &amp;c. but who, not perceiving any &s;en&s;ible unu&s;ual trouble, or inconvenience, do not im|mediately think of the &s;timulus that exi&s;ts in the internal organs, and are therefore far from con|ceiving it to be the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent cuta|neous affection.</P>
<P>A great eater, who vigorou&s;ly executes all the functions of life, and is perfectly well, never &s;u&s;|pects that his &s;tomach is &s;timulated by the far|rago of aliments, with which it is continually a&s;|&s;ailed; but &s;eeing the &s;urface of his body covered with eruptions, is di&s;po&s;ed to attribute them to any cau&s;e rather than the true one. But there is a variety of &s;timulus, of which our internal organs are &s;en&s;ible, that we do not perceive; thus, we have no &s;en&s;e of the &s;timulus excited by the blood circulating in the heart, nor of that which the juices of the &s;tomach occa&s;ion
<PB N="20" REF="19">in its nervous membrane, and which the bile and other juices, occa&s;ion in the inte&s;tines, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the&s;e different &s;timulus, and many others, I do not &s;peak of, are increa&s;ed, and become violent, then not only the proper organ where the &s;pecific fluids are &s;eparated and collected, but other parts, are, by &s;ympathy, &s;en&s;ible thereof, without any knowledge or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mind. It is from effects that a knowledge of the wonderful laws of the animal economy is obtained; and in order to prevent mankind's being any longer mi&s;taken, as to the real &s;ources of cutaneous eruptions, I have endeavoured to explain them the more fully, that they may be the better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that the &s;en&s;ibility and mobi|lity of the arterial ve&s;&s;els are &s;o very great<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Anatomy of the Skin, page 25, it is &s;een, that all the nerves of the body interweave them&s;elves and actually terminate in the &s;kin.</NOTE>, that they &s;ympathize, extremely, with all the ner|vous &s;y&s;tem, but, particularly with the &s;tomach, the inte&s;tines, and the womb, &amp;c. <HI>and</HI> al&s;o, of the peculiar influence, which, the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, affecting the nerves, have upon the &s;kin; nor, mu&s;t we forget what is &s;till greater, <HI>the action</HI> of the <HI>atmo&s;phere,</HI> to which the face, particularly, is always <HI>expo&s;ed.</HI> Since then, there are &s;o many
<PB N="21" REF="20">agents to di&s;turb the functions of the &s;kin, it is not extraordinary to &s;ee the &s;urface of the body, and particularly the face, &s;o often affected with lumps, blotches, pimples, efflore&s;cence, herpeys, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;indeed, it would be more extraordi|nary if it was otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The action of &s;timulus, directed now to one part, and now to another, gives occa&s;ion to <HI>par|tial</HI> eruption, and the character of this eruption differs, according to the nature of the &s;timulus, its duration, and, of the &s;en&s;ibility of the per&s;on affected.</P>
<P>The&s;e appearances, &s;ometimes, re&s;emble &s;cor|butic &s;pots, and the practitioner, not well in|&s;tructed, often confounds the one with the other, but without rea&s;on; becau&s;e the real &s;ymptoms of &s;curvy, never attend the affections we are &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>It is truly important to determine the true cau&s;e of this di&s;order, for, from hence, one ought to deduce the medical indications; and I have endeavoured, in my little work, to fix this point, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by rea&s;on, experience, and authority.</P>
<P>In order then, to demon&s;trate the &s;evere con|&s;equences which obtain, by a wrong and fal&s;e principle, we need but reflect upon the ordinary method of humouri&s;ts in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion; they always begin by purging and bleeding, and
<PB N="22" REF="21">&s;o prepare the body to the u&s;e of remedies, which they call <HI>&s;weeteners</HI> and bal&s;amicks.</P>
<P>This plan is as infamous as their theory, as it &s;erves merely to weaken more and more the con|&s;titution, and, from hence, the cutaneous affec|tions take a greater extent, and its character be|comes more hurtful, &s;evere, and unea&s;y. Ex|perience &s;o fatal ought to teach them to re|nounce a practice which is always u&s;ele&s;s, and frequently dangerous.</P>
<P>Another remark mu&s;t be made on the method of humori&s;ts; it is, that they attempt to cure <HI>in the &s;ame manner</HI> all the unhappy per&s;ons which fall into their hands, however various may have been the cau&s;e. If in their opinion an acrimony does exi&s;t, it cannot be the &s;ame in all individuals; nay, it mu&s;t extremely differ from one another from their <HI>tempers, con&s;titution, age,</HI> cu&s;toms, and pa&s;&s;ions, and, to be corrected, its nature &s;hould be <HI>known,</HI> &amp;c. It is another argument of the ab&s;urdity of the treatment employed by the hu|mori&s;ts, and is al&s;o, equally a proof, that they have not an idea, nor ju&s;t nor fal&s;e, of the acri|mony which they undertake, and pretend to de&s;|troy, and, that they exerci&s;e the art blindly.</P>
<P>The good practitioners, in&s;tead of occupying them&s;elves, to correct an imaginary vice of the blood, direct their thoughts to the &s;kin, as there is the focus and &s;eat of the di&s;order.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<P>The qualities of the eruption are not always the &s;ame, nay, they differ materially, not only in different &s;ubjects, but al&s;o in the &s;ame in|dividual; for a per&s;on may have &s;pots, her|peys, blotches, &amp;c. &amp;c. all at the &s;ame time, which could not happen if the vice was in the blood, for then they would be all of the &s;ame &s;pecies of eruption, which is not here nece&s;&s;ary, as it proceeds from an altered &s;ecretion, and this &s;ecretion is not every where the &s;ame, but changes in different parts in the &s;ame body, be|cau&s;e every part, nay, every <HI>point</HI> of the body, is furni&s;hed with ITS OWN &s;en&s;ibility, and as the phy&s;iologi&s;ts &s;ay, "<HI>Sua fruntur vita."</HI></P>
<P>It might &s;eem contradictory and paradoxical, that we &s;hould propo&s;e <HI>one</HI> remedy as the &s;pecific in all the&s;e ca&s;es; but it is not &s;o, for we are NOT intending by THIS remedy to attack the bad qualities of the matters which occa&s;ion the local di&s;order, becau&s;e we know not their intrin&s;ic na|ture; there is another way for us to take that is more &s;hort, ea&s;y, and at the &s;ame time &s;ure; it is to alter the action of the ve&s;&s;els which <HI>prepare it improperly,</HI>&mdash; IT IS TO CHANGE THE CUTA|NEOUS SECRETION, by applying to the ve&s;|&s;els them&s;elves. The &s;mall arteries which fil|trate the per&s;pirable matter, are affected with &s;pa&s;m; I &s;ay, with <HI>&s;pa&s;m,</HI> for I &s;ee that the re|mote cau&s;es of the eruption act upon the &s;kin
<PB N="24" REF="23">as &s;timulants; and I ob&s;erve, that, if the &s;timulus be momentary, the eruptions almo&s;t always di&s;|appear &s;pontaneou&s;ly, with &s;wiftne&s;s and faci|lity. When the &s;timulus has been of long con|tinuation, the &s;pa&s;m continues though the &s;timu|lus has &s;ub&s;ided, and EXISTS NO MORE.</P>
<P>From the foregoing reflections, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that the principal indication in the cutaneous affections is TO RESOLVE THE SPASM, from which the preternatural &s;ecretion depends, and to give a bland tone to the cutaneous ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>The Lotion produces this effect, by calming the &s;pa&s;modic contraction, and re&s;toring the tone of the excretories, and the cutaneous ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>It often happens, that in the fir&s;t moments, the u&s;e of the Lotion increa&s;es the eruption, be|cau&s;e the action of the &s;kin becomes more ea&s;y and natural: this &s;ymptom, be&s;ides being de|mon&s;trative and &s;atisfactory, announces always a very quick recovery.</P>
<P>Generally the recovery is not rapid, but comes on &s;lowly, and in proportion as the ve&s;&s;els ap|proach their former &s;tate, and u&s;ual manner of acting.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANATOMY OF THE SKIN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ITS IMPURITIES, AND THE CAUSES THEREOF.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE has been no le&s;s bountiful and attentive to the &s;tructure of the external covering, than to the more noble parts of our frame; it is no le&s;s remarkable for its general u&s;e, than for its beauty; it is compo&s;ed of two parts, viz. the epidermis, or &s;carf-&s;kin, which is the external, and the cu|tis, or true &s;kin, which is underneath: the fir&s;t is inorganic; the other is, what anatomi&s;ts call highly organized, being made up of arteries, veins, and nerves, and exqui&s;itely formed to convey to the mind, the various impre&s;&s;ions we receive, which impre&s;&s;ions, we call feeling.</P>
<P>It is be&s;et with many &s;mall glands, for &s;eparating the per|&s;pirable matter, and with others al&s;o, which furni&s;h a dif|ferent and a more <HI>mucilaginous</HI> fluid, contained in a fine reticular, or network &s;ub&s;tance, between the outward and inward &s;kins, to &s;heath the nerves from injury, and regu|late the &s;en&s;e of feeling, which would, without &s;uch pro|tection, be too exqui&s;ite. The internal &s;urface becomes in|&s;en&s;ibly of a le&s;s firm texture, and at length degenerates into the cellular membrane; a great number of arteries, and &s;till greater number of veins, extend them&s;elves within its &s;ub|&s;tance; the lymphatics di&s;tributed upon it, are al&s;o very numerous, as well as the nerves, the extremities of which evade the ob&s;ervation of the mo&s;t di&s;cerning anatomi&s;ts.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>The &s;carf, or outward &s;kin, is a very fine tran&s;parent membrane, in the compo&s;ition of which, neither ve&s;&s;els or fibres are ob&s;ervable; it is, in it&s;elf, <HI>not</HI> endued with a &s;en&s;e of feeling,&mdash;ea&s;ily &s;eparated from the parts beneath,&mdash;is renewable when it peels off, or is de&s;troyed by any accident; &mdash;it is pierced by an infinite number of pores, which afford a pa&s;&s;age to the hairs, and in which, terminate, the lympha|tics and excretory ducts of the &s;ebaceous glands; it is pre|&s;erved &s;oft and &s;upple, by the mucus &s;ecretion below it, and by the per&s;pirable matter opening on it, through tho&s;e in|numerable pores. It is generally imagined by anatomi&s;ts, that, this membrane is formed by the conden&s;ation of a fluid, furni&s;hed by the extremities of the capillary arteries.</P>
<P>Under the true &s;kin, and over the mu&s;cles, Nature has placed another covering, called the membrana cellularis, or cellular membrane; between this membrane and the true &s;kin, lie a number of &s;mall glands, called <HI>&s;ebaceous</HI> glands: the&s;e glands have one or more excretory ducts, every where opening on the &s;urface of the &s;kin, through which <HI>is</HI> tran&s;mitted the fluid the glands &s;ecrete, to lubricate the &s;kin, and keep it lax, <HI>and a very important office they do per|form.</HI> Other glands &s;eparate a fatty matter of the &s;kin, of the nature of &s;uet, and the&s;e are found, in tho&s;e parts of the body, which are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the action of the air; in other parts it does not contain any.</P>
<P>The &s;kin is capable of being di&s;tended, and of contracting it&s;elf to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree; it has a variety of u&s;es; but we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to that one only, which is mo&s;t parti|cularly intere&s;ting to our &s;ubject, namely, the &s;ecretion of the matter of per&s;piration. I mu&s;t not here be under&s;tood as &s;peaking of a fluid floating in, and circulating with the blood, but, of a fluid which the ve&s;&s;els and glands them|&s;elves prepare and elaborate, upon which, they impre&s;s characters of a greater, or le&s;&s;er, degree of malignity, accord|ing
<PB N="27" REF="26">to the degree of &s;timulus with which they are oppre&s;&s;ed. This matter, in its natural &s;tate, is only a watery fluid, <HI>but</HI> when by any exciting cau&s;e, its <HI>quantity</HI> is increa&s;ed, its na|ture is <HI>changed,</HI> and it immediately appears to contain a <HI>&s;a|line</HI> principle, along with a certain quantity of inflammable air.</P>
<P>In acute di&s;ea&s;es, convul&s;ions, and epilep&s;y, its altera|tions are frequently very remarkable, &s;o that its &s;mell be|comes di&s;gu&s;ting and intolerable. From numberle&s;s other cau&s;es, it frequently happens, that this &s;ecretion is won|derfully changed, &s;o that the matter furni&s;hed by it, ad|heres to, and corrodes the &s;kin, and forms a chronic cu|taneous di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This la&s;t &s;ubject, is meant to be inve&s;tigated in this Trea|ti&s;e.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE appearance, of cutaneous eruptions, varies con&s;ide|rably, either on account of the different &s;en&s;ibility of the per&s;ons affected, or, of the different character of the &s;ecreted fluid.</P>
<P>Sometimes they pre&s;ent them&s;elves, as a red efflore&s;cence, under which a white powder is formed, which, after &s;ome time, falls off, and leaves the &s;kin apparently healthy; the efflore&s;cence, however, again makes its appearance, and again goes off in the &s;ame way. The&s;e alterations continue for life, unle&s;s cured by a topical remedy.</P>
<P>At other times, there are very &s;mall pu&s;tules or pimples, like millet-&s;eed, filled with a tran&s;parent water, which when &s;hed, conden&s;es and forms cru&s;ts or &s;cabs; the&s;e detach them&s;elves, but the &s;kin underneath being inflamed, pours
<PB N="28" REF="27">out fre&s;h matter, which undergoes the &s;ame change as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Sometimes, likewi&s;e, there are pu&s;tules, containing &s;erum, which at fir&s;t is white, then becomes yellow, excudes, and is converted into cru&s;ts; at other times the di&s;ea&s;e puts on the appearance and &s;ymptoms of the itch. <HI>What is called</HI> black worms frequently appear on the no&s;e, the chin, the cheek bones, &amp;c. this is the &s;ebaceous matter of the glands, ob&s;tructed and lodging in the ducts, which when &s;queezed out, have the appearance of worms; the black|ne&s;s at the outward extremity is dirt, too much in&s;inuated to wa&s;h off; and the rea&s;on they infe&s;t the&s;e parts particu|larly, is owing to the ducts being larger on tho&s;e extremities than in other parts.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, in other in&s;tances, there is only a redne&s;s in the &s;kin, or &s;pots, which prove extremely trouble&s;ome, from the itching which attends them. Sen&s;ations of prick|ing and itching almo&s;t con&s;tantly attend di&s;ea&s;es of this na|ture, and it &s;carcely ever happens, that they go off of them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>That the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin, are, in general, &s;imply local affections, was an opinion entertained by Dr. Cullen, one of the mo&s;t enlightened Phy&s;icians of the pre&s;ent age; and from the numerous remote cau&s;es, it evidently appears, that a DEPRAVED SECRETION, in the cutaneous capillary arte|ries, and the vicious elaborated matter, by the cutaneous glands, are the proximate cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. This acrid and corro&s;ive matter, could not exi&s;t in the ma&s;s of blood, without exciting grievous di&s;orders in the animal economy; but, as the latter does not exi&s;t, there is not any rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing the exi&s;tence of the former.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who are &s;ubject to eruption, generally enjoy good health, and execute their functions without in|convenience.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
<P N="3">III. Tho&s;e who have a bad con&s;titution, and in whom one might, with &s;ome appearance of probability, &s;uppo&s;e an acrimony exi&s;ting in their fluids, are lea&s;t of all &s;ubject to eruptions. They are never met with in ca&s;es of chloro|&s;is and cachexy.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The eruption is generally confined to &s;ome one par|ticular part; as to the no&s;e, the cheeks, the brea&s;t, or the ex|tremities, but almo&s;t, always, to the face alone.</P>
<P>If it were true, that the arteries received from the blood, the matter which occa&s;ioned the eruption, and that they di&s;charge it upon the &s;urface of the body, why do they not di&s;charge it in equal proportion upon every part of it? Would it not be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the artery <HI>A,</HI> or the artery <HI>B</HI> alone, &s;hould have a power of &s;electing, every thing viciated, from the general ma&s;s, whil&s;t all the other ve&s;&s;els of the &s;y&s;tem receive their blood from the &s;ame &s;ource?</P>
<P N="5">V. Cutaneous di&s;orders, are not peculiar to any particular cla&s;s of individuals, but attack all without di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>Thus, we meet with them alike, in the voluptuary, and the a&s;cetic; in tho&s;e who are little &s;en&s;ible to the allure|ments of wine, or the &s;till &s;ofter ones of love; in tho&s;e who do not work, as in tho&s;e who do: in a word, the di&s;ea&s;e at|tacks per&s;ons of all temperaments, characters, and pa&s;&s;ions. This, precludes every &s;u&s;picion of a &s;pecific acrimony of the humours, as it could not be found in the mid&s;t of circum|&s;tances &s;o oppo&s;ite to each other.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And la&s;tly, if there really exi&s;ted a di&s;ea&s;e in the fluids, &s;ome advantage might be derived from the u&s;e of tho&s;e means, which Phy&s;icians have characteri&s;ed under the titles of edulcorants, refrigerants, bal&s;amic and anti&s;ceptic me|dicines; but, on the contrary, experience has unfortunately &s;hewn, that in&s;tead of the patients receiving benefit from their employment, the di&s;ea&s;e is uniformly exa&s;perated, and
<PB N="30" REF="29">becomes wor&s;e and wor&s;e: for confirmation of this fact I have only to appeal to the tribunal of tho&s;e who have been the victims of their credulity. The &s;kin is therefore the &s;ource of the eruption.</P>
<P>M. Lorry, a very ingenious French Phy&s;ician, who has written a very voluminous work upon cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, adduces many in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who the in&s;tant after having eaten of certain kinds of aliment, or taken certain liquids, had the face, or &s;ome other part of the body covered with pimples, which di&s;appeared as &s;oon as the irritation of the &s;tomach had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>Eruptions, al&s;o, frequently appear, in a very remarkable &s;hort time after drinking cold liquors, particularly cyder, when heated; this is one eruption which often finally be|comes a real chronical cutaneous di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Riverious Hoffman, and all eminent practitioners, have remarked, that, the &s;aburra of the alimentary canal, frequent|ly occa&s;ions ery&s;ipelatous affections, which go off as &s;oon as the &s;aburra is evacuated.</P>
<P>Pechlin, quotes examples, of in&s;tantaneous eruptions, produced by violent emotions of the mind, and the hi&s;tory of medicine teems with &s;imilar examples.</P>
<P>A woman, Hyppocrates tells us, had, during pregnancy, an exanthematous affection of the face, which went off im|mediately after delivery.</P>
<P>There are many women, as M. Lory has ob&s;erved, who in certain delicate circum&s;tances, have eruptions which la&s;t as long as their cau&s;e continues to exi&s;t, and no longer.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, it is evident, that the &s;kin has a con&s;ent or &s;ympathy with every part of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, &mdash;that every impre&s;&s;ion, whether phy&s;ical or moral, may ea&s;ily become an indirect &s;timulus to the &s;kin, and, that this &s;timulus is capable of altering its functions in &s;uch a way, as to give ri&s;e to a &s;ecretion of an acrid matter, and con&s;equent eruption.</P>

<P>Since we are here in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es which explain, in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, the origin of cutaneous di&s;|ea&s;es, it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek for another in the blood, and gratuitou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;tence of an <HI>univer&s;al</HI> acrimony.</P>
<P>The term acrimony, is, in its application, extremely ana|logous, to the <HI>occult qualities</HI> &s;o much in u&s;e, among the an|cients; that is to &s;ay, a term void of &s;en&s;e, a term, to which Phy&s;icians only a&s;&s;ociate fal&s;e and arbitrary ideas.</P>
<P>The acrimony which is generally accu&s;ed, is that of the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>It is commonly the want of &s;ound fre&s;h animal food, with the want of vegetables, which gives ri&s;e to the &s;curvy; but, in London, neither of the&s;e is wanting: we are provided with excellent fermented malt liquors, as beer and porter, with brandy, rum, and other &s;pirits, and foreign wines, which may all be con&s;idered as &s;o many anti&s;corbutics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Van-Swieten, Millman, Lind, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the Scurvy.</NOTE>. We are not in the neighbourhood of mar&s;hes; &s;alted or &s;moak-dryed fle&s;h or fi&s;h do not con&s;titute any con&s;iderable part of our food, neither do we drink putrid or &s;tagnated water, which give the di&s;po&s;ition to &s;curvy. In a word, however it may have &s;uited the intere&s;t of regulars or irregulars to in&s;i&s;t upon it, our mode of living, and our &s;ituation, are by no means, favourable to its production.</P>
<P>Scurvy is preceded or accompanied by &s;ymptoms, which are never met with in the cutaneous affections of which we are &s;peaking. In fact, the &s;curvy begins by a &s;pontaneous weakne&s;s, or &s;en&s;e of weight in the whole body, pain in the mu&s;cles, inability to walk, a difficult and laborious re&s;|piration. The colour of the face of &s;corbutic patients, is pale and &s;allow, the mouth exhales a fetid &s;mell, the gums become red, painful, and flabby, and liable to bleed upon the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, the teeth fall out, flying pains are felt in
<PB N="32" REF="31">different parts of the body, bleedings come on, and <HI>la&s;tly, (and not till then)</HI> ulcerations make their appearance, parti|cularly in the legs, and the &s;kin becomes covered with an itchy eruption, pu&s;tules, and cru&s;ts.</P>
<P>The matter which produces the eruption is &s;o acrid as to corrode the &s;kin, and its &s;mell is highly di&s;gu&s;ting and alka|line. This &s;hort &s;ketch evinces the enormous difference, which obtains between &s;imple affections of the &s;kin, and the <HI>real &s;curvy.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who confound them together, either are unac|quainted with the cau&s;es, and nature of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, or they abu&s;e the confidence which the world, without &s;uffi|cient examination, may repo&s;e upon their talents or integrity.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e principles, which are &s;upported both by rea&s;oning and facts, I may advance, without running a ri&s;k of being accu&s;ed of temerity, that, <HI>cutaneous affections, being a local di&s;ea&s;e, require a local treatment.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="publisher's note">
<P>(NOTE.) The &s;ingle authority of Mr. Gowland upon this point, may not, perhaps, be of &s;ufficient weight to carry along with it conviction and per&s;ua&s;ion, but, the world, &s;urely, will not refu&s;e to accord its confidence to that of men of &s;cience. The <HI>Proprietors,</HI> therefore, take the liberty of adducing the authority, of one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;urgeons, this, or any other country can boa&s;t of, and, who&s;e works are known in every part of Europe; we mean the Profe&s;&s;or Bell, of the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>"It was" &s;ays he, "till lately believed, that eruptive di&s;ea&s;es of this nature (herpetic) could never appear but in con&s;equence of &s;ome general morbid affection of the &s;y&s;tem, and, accordingly, a great variety of internal remedies have been recommended, by almo&s;t every author who has written upon the &s;ubject. It has even been commonly con&s;idered, as an un&s;afe and dangerous practice, to attempt the cure of
<PB N="33" REF="32">&s;uch eruptions in any other way, than by correcting the fluids which at fir&s;t were &s;uppo&s;ed to have produced them: it is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, however, that the opinion &s;hould have remained &s;o long uncontroverted by regular practitioners; as, from the writings of many old authors it appears, that complaints of this kind were con&s;tantly and ea&s;ily cured, <HI>as they &s;till are,</HI> by every itinerant, with local external ap|plication only.</P>
<P>"This, we &s;hould imagine, ought, very &s;oon, to have over|turned the general notion, which prevailed with re&s;pect to the nature of tho&s;e di&s;orders, and which &s;eemed, all along, to have no other foundation than antiquity for its &s;upport. Modern practitioners, however, not being &s;hackled by &s;uch authority, have, in many in&s;tances, ventured to di&s;pute, and boldly to deviate from, the opinions of their predece&s;&s;ors, and the improvements which have univer&s;ally re&s;ulted from &s;uch a free &s;pirit of enquiry, have never yet given them rea|&s;on to repent their having done &s;o.</P>
<P>"This, in no in&s;tance, has been more remarkable, nor at|tended with better effects, than in the treatment of cuta|neous di&s;orders, which, from having been very perplexed, and intricate, will &s;oon, it is hoped, become a very &s;imple, and ea&s;y part of the practitioner's employment.</P>
<P>"In&s;tead of the tedious, and debilitating cour&s;es of medi|cines, which patients went through formerly, and which, perhaps, they are &s;till too frequently obliged to undergo, <HI>it is now found,</HI> that <HI>the greate&s;t number of the&s;e complaints, are more certainly, and &s;peedily removed, by the u&s;e of local remedies merely, than they ever were by a contrary cour&s;e."</HI></P>
<P>BELL, on the Theory and Management of Ulcers.</P>
<P>Sect. ix, page 336.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Proprietors may here be allowed to remark, that Mr. Bell had no Specific to recommend, no view or intere&s;t whatever, but the benefit of his fellow creatures.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="34" REF="33">
<P>Bell became convinced, by long experience, that the ex|ternal application of medicaments, rarely di&s;appoint the ex|pectations of the Phy&s;ician and Patient. He enumerates &s;e|veral of tho&s;e employed, as well by him as others, and ob|&s;erves, that the principle dependence, is to be placed upon tho&s;e which are of an a&s;tringent and drying quality.</P>
<P>I have been able to di&s;cover a remedy which I may with the greate&s;t propriety &s;tile "the Specific for Cutaneous Di&s;|ea&s;es;" it has a great advantage over tho&s;e which have gene|rally been employed, namely, that &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any the &s;lighte&s;t repellant quality, it is the very rever&s;e, and acts in a mode diametrically oppo&s;ite thereto. Its operation con|fi&s;ts in taking off the &s;pa&s;m of the extremities of the capillary arteries, removing the inflammation where it exi&s;ts, and gradually bringing back the excretorious ve&s;&s;els to <HI>the di&s;|charge</HI> of their <HI>natural</HI> functions.</P>
<P>Some days after its employment, the inflammation di&s;ap|pears, and con&s;equently the tran&s;udation; after which, the &s;kin re&s;umes its natural &s;tate and complection. If there are any pu&s;tules, they become in the fir&s;t place le&s;s trouble&s;ome, which &s;hew that the lymph they contain has lo&s;t &s;omewhat of its malignant properties.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, they di&s;appear altogether, and never appear again in any part of the body, except &s;ome new cau&s;e ari&s;es, or that the natural texture of the &s;kin &s;hould be inadequate to re&s;i&s;t the power of the external air, in which ca&s;e its appli|cation &s;hould be &s;ometimes repeated.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es, which, actually owe their ri&s;e to &s;ome &s;pe|cific virus, as the &s;crofulus, venereal, &amp;c. even though the morbific cau&s;e be de&s;troyed, the local di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;kin is incapable of curing it&s;elf. Ve&s;&s;els which have been in the <HI>habit</HI> of making, a depraved &s;ecretion, do not of them&s;elves, change this di&s;po&s;ition, although the ma&s;s of
<PB N="35" REF="34">blood and the con&s;titution be in a healthy and natural &s;tate. <HI>Van Swieten,</HI> when &s;peaking of venereal ulcers, has made this ob&s;ervation: Here the nece&s;&s;ity of a topical treatment becomes particularly evident; that is, the application, of a remedy, to the part affected. Thus, the Lotion is productive of the greate&s;t advantage, even in &s;crofulus, and &s;corbutic ca&s;es.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid, that there are &s;ebaceous glands in the &s;kin, the excretory ducts of which, throw out a &s;uetty matter, and that there is likewi&s;e a great number of excretory ve&s;&s;els, which are, a continuation of the capillary arteries.</P>
<P>The&s;e ducts and ve&s;&s;els, are frequently, con&s;tricted by &s;ud|den cold, &s;o, that the matter which ought to be exhaled, is pent up, and if not evacuated by the inte&s;tines or kidneys, it forms tubercles, or hard knots, and &s;mall vi&s;&s;icles, as has been ob&s;erved, by the celebrated Ludwig.</P>
<P>The face, is the mo&s;t common &s;eat of the eruption of which we are &s;peaking, on account of its being expo&s;ed more than any other part of the body, to the action of the air. Eruptions will &s;ometimes frequently remain, after the cau&s;e has cea&s;ed; for, nature is not always equal, by its own pow|er, of ree&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e minute organs in their natural functions; in con&s;equence of which, the &s;kin remains dis|figured, not only by a partial redne&s;s, but by &s;cabious irre|gularities on its &s;urface, and even by matter contained in pu&s;tules, and by cru&s;ts, which ari&s;e from the conden&s;ation of the lymph, e&s;caping from the ve&s;icles.</P>
<P>If this affection be unfortunately neglected on its fir&s;t ap|pearance, it &s;oon overleaps its fir&s;t limits, extends its &s;phere of action, and every day gives additional force to its malig|nity. This di&s;ea&s;e, commits horrid ravages on tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e general &s;y&s;tem is in a &s;tate of debility.</P>
<P>The female &s;ex, the endearing bond of &s;ociety, when once attacked by the&s;e di&s;orders, &s;uffer more from them than men, on account of their &s;kin being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a far greater degree of delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="35">
<P>How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing mu&s;t it not be to a fine woman, to the perfecting of who&s;e face nature has lavished all her power, to find the beauteous fabric &s;potted and di&s;coloured with di&s;gu&s;ting pimples, which de&s;troy the effect of all her charms? It is in this ca&s;e, that the imagination, who&s;e in|fluence on the &s;ofter &s;ex is &s;o very exten&s;ive, takes the lead, exa&s;perates the di&s;ea&s;e, and renders it a thou&s;and times more ob&s;tinate: and yet I can a&s;&s;ure my readers, from long and a&s;&s;iduous ob&s;ervation, drawn from the experience of many years, that the&s;e impurities, ari&s;ing from ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, are the ea&s;ie&s;t of all others to overcome. The ve&s;&s;els, when once freed from the matter contained in them, and which has become foreign and vitiated by &s;tagnation, readily re&s;ume the tone and energy nece&s;&s;ary for cutaneous &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>The Lotion, con&s;tantly produces this effect; it wa&s;hes and clean&s;es the &s;urface, and, by penetrating within the &s;mall, ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;els, di&s;&s;olves the conden&s;ed fluids contained in them, and facilitates their expui&s;ion.</P>
<P>When this is executed, the &s;kin re&s;umes its natural &s;tate, becomes &s;mooth and poli&s;hed, and, exhibits that brilliancy of tint which depends upon the free circulation of the fluids in the cutaneous arteries, and, the continual afflux of tho&s;e, furni&s;hed by the different glands and ve&s;&s;els, which are found in the &s;kin.</P>
<P>In addre&s;&s;ing my reflections to the public, I have ad|vanced, that &s;imple cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, are <HI>local affections only,</HI> and I have given proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion; I have &s;aid, that, the mode of treating them, ought to be local; and, both authority, facts, and rea&s;oning, have confirmed what I have advanced.</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted, that my Lotion, is a Specific for the&s;e Eruptions; and I appeal to tho&s;e who have experienced its efficacy, after they had been di&s;appointed by internal means:
<PB N="37" REF="36">thus, the goodne&s;s and infallibility of my Specific, is a &s;uffi|cient an&s;wer to, and compleatly confutes the invidious at|tacks that have been made again&s;t me, for its introduction.</P>
