<P>REMARKS ON Dr. BOERHAAVE'S THEORY OF THE ATTRITION of the BLOOD In the LUNGS.</P>

<PB N="3" REF="2">
<P>THE celebrated Dr. BOERHAAVE in his <HI>In|&s;titutiones Medicae,</HI> lays it down as a fun|damental Principle, that the Blood, in pa&s;&s;ing through the Lungs, undergoes a Degree of Attrition con&s;iderably greater than in any other Part of the Body. This Attrition, according to his Sy&s;tem, eminently increa&s;es the Heat of the Blood, at the &s;ame Time that it unites the ele|mentary Parts of it more intimately, and makes the whole Ma&s;s more den&s;e and compact.</P>
<P>I am &s;o far from a&s;&s;enting to this Theory, that I cannot but apprehend it is abundantly con|futed by the Texture and Appearance of the Parts them&s;elves. Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, for In&s;tance, that the right Ventricle of the Heart, which is thin|ner and apparently weaker than the left, can com|municate a greater Impul&s;e to the Blood? This however is one of the fir&s;t Requi&s;ites in producing a greater Degree of Attrition. There is &s;till a more remarkable Difference between the Pulmonary Ar|tery, and the Aorta; the one, being loo&s;e and flaccid; the other, of &s;o den&s;e and compact a Na|ture, as to re&s;emble, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, a Cartilage.
<PB N="4" REF="3">If we go on to examine the Texture of the Parts, through which the&s;e Circulations are re&s;pectively performed, and ob&s;erve how tender and &s;pungy the Lungs are, in Compari&s;on of the Mu&s;cular Parts of the Body, we cannot avoid coming to the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion; unle&s;s we would &s;uppo&s;e that Nature made the &s;tronger Sub&s;tance to re&s;i&s;t the weaker Impre&s;&s;ion: which &s;urely would be inter|preting its Meaning very perver&s;ely.</P>
<P>Neither is it material to &s;ay that the Blood may &s;uffer con&s;iderable Attrition by the alternate Motion of the Lungs in Re&s;piration; either when expanded by the Air, or compre&s;&s;ed by the Thorax. For, Action and Reaction being equal, it makes no Dif|ference in the Effect, whether the Lungs be every Moment pre&s;&s;ed upon the Blood, or the Stream of Blood forced again&s;t the Lungs. Should we there|fore admit the Sum of the Attritions produced by the&s;e two Cau&s;es in the Lungs, to be greater than that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the corre&s;ponding Arteries of the Body, the &s;ame Objection would &s;till remain, in regard to the Structure of the Parts. It would &s;till be impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend how the Author of Nature could proportion his Work &s;o ill, as to make the Power of Re&s;i&s;tance greate&s;t, where the Impre&s;&s;ion was lea&s;t: to give an unnece&s;&s;ary Degree of Strength to one Sy&s;tem of Arteries, or an in&s;uffi|cient one to the other.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>The Difficulties that attend this Theory are not more extraordinary, than the Proofs, by which it is &s;upported, are defective. In regard to the Velo|city of the two Circulations, Dr. HALLER expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: <Q><HI>Cum &s;anguinis tantum per pulmones tran&s;eat in dato tempore, quantum per univer&s;um corpus humanum, &s;equitur, ut &s;anguis per pulmonem in eadem ratione fluat celeri&ugrave;s, qu&acirc; ip&s;e pulmo minor e&s;t.</HI> <BIBL>(<HI>In</HI> Boerhaav. <HI>Praelection. Acad.</HI> Vol. II. p. 169.)</BIBL></Q> It is hard to &s;ay whether the Doctor is more unfor|tunate here in his Premi&s;&s;es, or his Conclu&s;ion. In the fir&s;t Place, that equal Quantities of Blood pa&s;s in equal Times through the Lungs, and through the larger Circuit of the Body, is a&s;&s;erted, as far as I can inform my&s;elf, without any manner of Foun|dation either in Rea&s;on or Experiment. And &s;e|condly, admitting it to be true, the Con&s;equence would be ju&s;t the contrary of what the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es; namely, that the Motion of the Blood through the Lungs mu&s;t be &s;lower, and in the ve|ry &s;ame Proportion too, that he a&s;&s;igns for its being quicker. In a late Edition of the Commentary on <HI>Boerhaave's</HI> In&s;titutions, I find the following Note, by which it appears that the Doctor begins to &s;u&s;|pect at lea&s;t, the Ju&s;tne&s;s and Force of his Rea&s;oning: <Q><HI>Haec omnia expedita &s;unt. Unum &s;upere&s;t an velo|ci&ugrave;s trajicitur per pulmones Sanguis? Videtur etiam
<PB N="6" REF="5">lenti&ugrave;s trajici, quia &s;anguis per corpus trajectus viam mult&ograve; majorem eodem tempore ab&s;olvit,&mdash;&amp; video hanc rationem fus&egrave; &amp; ornat&egrave; proponi a Cl. Krugero in Phy&s;iologi&acirc; Germanic&egrave; &s;cript&acirc;.</HI> <BIBL>Vol. II. p. 230. Ed. Gotting. 1745.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It has indeed been ob&s;erved by Dr. <HI>Hales</HI> (<HI>Hae|ma&s;tat.</HI> p. 67.) that in the Lungs of a Frog, the Blood moves with greater Velocity than in any other Part of the Body. We are not however to make any general Inferences from this Phaenome|non, which &s;eems to depend upon the peculiar Structure of the Frog and &s;ome other &s;mall Ani|mals, the Heart of which, having only one Ventri|cle, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity give the &s;ame Impul&s;e to all the circulating Blood. We cannot, I &s;ay, conclude from In&s;tances of this Kind, that the relative Ve|locity of the two Circulations is exactly the &s;ame in larger Animals, where the Heart, having two Ventricles, may po&s;&s;ibly impel the Blood with dif|ferent Degrees of Force.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider this Experiment in another Light. It appears that the Power exerted at the Origin of the pulmonary Artery and the Aorta being equal, the Blood moves with greater Velocity through the Lungs, than through any other Part of the Body: what are we to conclude from this,
<PB N="7" REF="6">but that the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs are larger, allowing the Blood to pa&s;s through them with greater Freedom? Which being once admitted, Dr. <HI>Boerhaave's</HI> Theory is directly overthrown, in the very In&s;tance that Dr. <HI>Haller</HI> refers to in Sup|port of it (Vol. II. p. 230.) and &s;till more clearly with re&s;pect to larger Animals, where the Force impelling the Blood into the Lungs is with good Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be le&s;s than that which throws it into the Aorta.</P>
