<HEAD><HI>Rea&s;ons, why the</HI> Apothecary <HI>may be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the Admini&s;tration of Medi|cines in the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, as well as the</HI> Phy&s;ician.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have at length found the mo&s;t effectual means to prevail with me, to break thro' the re&s;olution I had taken, of having no &s;hare in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;ie between the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> and the <HI>Apothecarys,</HI> by imputing my Silence to the bad|ne&s;s of my Cau&s;e: In the Vindi|cation of which, you are pleas'd
<PB N="4" REF="3">to &s;ay, no Sober or Ingenious Per|&s;on will offer to draw his Pen.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have hitherto been of the Opinion of the Major part of our Profe&s;&s;ion; that what has yet appear'd in publick again&s;t us, has not de&s;erv'd a &s;erious An|&s;wer, mo&s;t of it being taken up on Prejudice, the re&s;t a Scandalous A&s;per&s;ion, invented by a peevi&s;h Set of Men, who were angry that any body thriv'd be&s;ide them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus then have you unwilling|ly forced me into a &s;pacious Field, where on each &s;ide I may extend and dilate my &s;elf; and which way &s;oever I turn, may find at lea&s;t <HI>quantum &s;ufficit</HI> of Matter to Work upon.</P>
<P>But &s;ince you keep a more than ordinary pother with the high Ad|vantages which the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> have
<PB N="5" REF="4">over us, I &s;hall chu&s;e to examine the truth of that A&s;&s;ertion, and en|deavour to &s;et tho&s;e High Advan|tages, (as you call 'em) in a true light; and then leave the Impar|tial World to Judge, whether all be Go&s;pel which proceeds from the Pen of a Di&s;pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;ician.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t it is pretended, That the <HI>Ph&s;ician,</HI> by his liberal Educa|tion, (that is, by being bred at an <HI>Academy</HI>) has greater and more frequent opportunities of being in&s;tructed in the Practice of <HI>Phy|&s;ick,</HI> than the <HI>Apothecary</HI> can have; and that not only from his own private Reading and Ob&s;ervation, the Care and Direction of his Tutor, but al&s;o from the publick Lectures of the Phy&s;ick Profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Now if it be expected that this Argument &s;hould have any force again&s;t us, it mu&s;t fir&s;t be prov'd
<PB N="6" REF="5">what extraordinary Benefits tho&s;e are which Young Students receive from Tutors and Phy&s;ick Pro|fe&s;&s;ors; and not think that we &s;hall barely a&s;&s;ent to them, or be|lieve them to be &s;uch mighty things upon their &s;ingle Affirma|tion. I fear when the&s;e wonder|ful Lectures come to be examin'd, they will appear little better than Barren Animadver&s;ions on <HI>Galen, Hippocrates,</HI> or &s;ome other of the old Phy&s;ical Authours; which e|very Man is capable of doing, who is able to read and under&s;tand them. And I believe we may ven|ture to add, that the Auditors of the&s;e Lectures generally return with the &s;ame degree of Know|ledge and Satisfaction, as a late A&s;&s;embly did from a Lecture at <HI>Exeter-Exchange,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Cir|culation of the Blood.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<P>It is again Objected again&s;t us, That the Opportunities of being Advanc'd in the Knowledge of <HI>Anatomy</HI> and <HI>Chymi&s;try,</HI> &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Qualification of a Per&s;on who is to Admini&s;ter Phy&s;ick, are greater in the <HI>Academy</HI> than in any other place; and from whence the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is totally excluded.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd, that the un|der&s;tanding the wonderful Con|trivance and Texture of &s;o admi|rable a Machine, as is that of the <HI>Humane Body,</HI> is no ordinary part of Science, and what undoubted|ly the Per&s;on who Admini&s;ters Phy&s;ick ought to be acquainted withal. From which notwith|&s;tanding, I cannot &s;ee how the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is totally excluded, &s;ince there are con&s;tant Anatomical Di&s;|&s;ections at the <HI>Surgeon</HI>'s <HI>Hall,</HI> which is open to <HI>Apothecarys</HI> as well as
<PB N="8" REF="7"><HI>Phy&s;icians;</HI> and where I pre&s;ume there is more to be &s;een in one Year, than the Young <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> meets withal in &s;ix at his <HI>Acade|my.</HI></P>
<P>The pretended Advantages they have over us in <HI>Chymi&s;try,</HI> are of a-piece with tho&s;e before men|tion'd: For not to In&s;tance our own private <HI>Elaboratorys,</HI> the pub|lick <HI>Elaboratory</HI> at the <HI>Hall,</HI> where all Chymical Preparations are made in the highe&s;t Perfection, is a &s;ufficient Confutation of that groundle&s;s A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The&s;e, <HI>Sir,</HI> Being the principal Rea&s;ons on which You build your <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> namely, the Ad|vantages which the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> has over the <HI>Apothecary,</HI> I &s;hall not content my &s;elf with this general Reflection on them, but &s;hall pro|ceed to examine them more clo&s;ely,
<PB N="9" REF="8">and particularly that of Study|ing at the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity,</HI> by which is meant a liberal Education, as if the Streams of Polite Literature and Knowledge were not alike diffus'd throughout the <HI>Globe,</HI> but were &s;cantily confin'd to the Banks of <HI>Cham</HI> or <HI>I&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e then, An <HI>Apo|thecary,</HI> who is Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Tongues, (as there are few of them but are) to be as duly Qualified for the Read|ing, Comparing and Animadver|ting on <HI>Phy&s;ical</HI> Authours, as the <HI>Academic Phy&s;ician,</HI> which I think no &s;ober Intelligent Per&s;on will de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, if he allows that the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues as Taught at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, Pauls,</HI> &amp;c. to be as fit for that purpo&s;e, as what the Young <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> generally carries with him to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>Neither will it be di&s;puted with me, I think, that Reading, Reffe|ction, Ob&s;ervation and Experi|ment, are the only known means of acquiring Humane Learning and Science: To all which, the <HI>A|pothecary</HI> thus Qualified, has as fair pretences as the mo&s;t Elevated <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> of 'em all; and where|in the <HI>Apothecary</HI> may as rea&s;ona|bly be thought to make as great a Proficience, provided he u&s;es the &s;ame Indu&s;try and Application.</P>
<P>It may be objected, That altho' the <HI>Apothecary</HI> be thus Qualified, yet whil&s;t he is an Apprentice he has little or no time for the&s;e Stu|dys, if he had never &s;o great an Inclination; that what with the Duty to his Ma&s;ter, and the com|mon Nece&s;&s;ities and Expence of Life, which ask &s;ome time to be repair'd in &s;pight of us, there will
<PB N="11" REF="10">be little or none left for any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>To this I An&s;wer, That altho' for the fir&s;t Year or two there may be little el&s;e done, yet by that time he begins to have a true Ta&s;t of the Matter, and his Rea&s;on &s;hines forth with brighter Rays: If he be a Youth of any Spirit and E|mulation, he will and do's find a thou&s;and opportunities of advan|cing his Knowledge, equal, if not &s;uperiour to the <HI>Academic Phy&s;i|cian.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Apothecary</HI> then thus Qua|lified, may very rea&s;onably be thought to under&s;tand the Study of Phy&s;ick, the Natures of Di&s;|ea&s;es and their Cures, equally with the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> tho' he cannot boa&s;t the High Advantages of a liberal Education and <HI>Accademic</HI> Accom|pli&s;hments.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<P>Whil&s;t the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> contends with us after this manner, we &s;hall never recede from the&s;e Principles: But if he &s;hall &s;ay, That the Advan|tages of an <HI>Academic</HI> Education are a better Foundation for him to Set up for a Wit, a Poet, or En|tertaining Company; then indeed we &s;ubmit, frankly acknowledg|ing that we indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hun tho&s;e <HI>Arts,</HI> which rather tend to the Subver&s;ion and De&s;truction of the Animal Life, than its Pre&s;er|vation and Emolument.</P>
<P>If then the equal Learning of the <HI>Apothecary</HI> &s;ets him upon a le|vel with the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding his boa&s;ted Advantages over him, it can never be imagin'd that the Compo&s;ition and Admi|ni&s;tration of Medicines by which he di&s;covers their Nature and O|perations, will be any hindrance
<PB N="13" REF="12">to him in the per&s;ecution of tho&s;e Studies which naturally lead him to any inquiry into the Structure and Oeconomy of the Humane+dy, and the manner how the&s;e <HI>Me|dicines</HI> he prepares Operate upon it.</P>
<P>This certainly without Vanity we may affirm, That we under|&s;tand the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> as well, not to &s;ay better than mo&s;t Di&s;pen|&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI></P>
<P>The World is very &s;en&s;ible what Advantages they owe to the&s;e Mo|dern Reformers of Phy&s;ick; to who&s;e wonderful penetration we have not yet heard that Phy&s;ick has been Obliged for one Addition or Di&s;covery: But that is not their bu&s;ine&s;s, 'tis &s;ufficient for them if they can libel the Town in their awkard Exclamations again&s;t the <HI>Apothecarys,</HI> by which they vainly imagin'd to have Ingro&s;s'd the
<PB N="14" REF="13">whole Art of Compounding and Vending Medicines to the Publick. But alas! fond deluded Men, This knowing Age was not to be led Hoodwink'd to their Ruin. The Town &s;aw through the thin Di&s;|gui&s;e, and laugh at the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Contrivance: They knew the A|bilitys of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who un|dertook the Project, and that mo&s;t of 'em &s;o far from being able to Compound Medicines as they ought to be, &s;carce knew the Di|&s;tinction between <HI>Mint</HI> and <HI>Cardus.</HI> It may be thought perhaps, that here I have a little Tran&s;gre&s;s'd, and gone beyond the limits of Truth, for that &s;o &s;mall a degree of Knowledge is &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, that it is next to impo&s;&s;i|ble that even a Di&s;pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;i|cian</HI> &s;hould be without it. What|ever may be thought of it, I have
<PB N="15" REF="14">undeniable Proofs of this A&s;&s;erti|on to produce, when ever pro|vok'd to it.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, That however An|gry the Di&s;pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> may be with us at pre&s;ent, they had once a better Opinion of our A|bilitys and Under&s;tanding; I mean, when they Compos'd that mo&s;t Elaborate Piece, the <HI>London Di&s;pen&s;atory;</HI> where 'tis evident they did not under&s;tand what they were about, by the unaccountable Jumble of Alteratives and Ca|thartics in the &s;ame Compo&s;ition: Nay, nor even the making the Compo&s;ition it &s;elf; el&s;e, What is the meaning that we &s;o often meet with <HI>&V;t Artis E&s;t, Secundum Artum,</HI> and the like? By which at lea&s;t they tacitely confe&s;s that we are the more knowing of the Two.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>Since &s;o much has been &s;aid of the Di&s;pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to &s;peak a Word of their <HI>Mighty Captain,</HI> and to de&s;ire the Impartial Reader to Examine that Famous Book, which has made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the World; wherein the Igno|rance of its Writer is &s;o very Con&s;picuous, that we need hardly point at his Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>His Catalogue of <HI>Drugs</HI> and Simples, (notwith&s;tanding the whole Con&s;piracy labour'd for its Birth) is a hand&s;om Specimen of his Knowledge in the <HI>Materia Me|dica;</HI> wherein there is &s;carce a Paragraph which has not &s;ome one or more rang'd in their improper Cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;ele&s;s Remarks he has made on &s;ome of the be&s;t of Me|dicines, &s;how rather the Fertility
<PB N="17" REF="16">of his Spleen, than his Under&s;tan|ding: The which neverthele&s;s he fancies unan&s;werable, by his ha|ving taken &s;o much pains to bring Quotations from &s;ome Authours as Ob&s;cure and Splenatick as him|&s;elf for his Vouchers.</P>
<P>His Spleen and Ignorance will be the more remarkable, when we reflect on that Part of his Book, where with his wonted A&s;&s;u|rance he tells his Readers, That when it &s;hall plea&s;e the <HI>Almighty Di&s;pen&s;er</HI> of all things, to afflict them with any Malady, that they need not be very &s;ollicitous con|cerning the means of their Cure, that they have nothing to fear but the Lethiferous <HI>Apothecary;</HI> That if it &s;hould &s;o happen that no Di&s;|pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> be at hand, 'tis much &s;afer to tru&s;t to the uncer|tain Event of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the
<PB N="18" REF="17">Direction of Nature, or to any thing el&s;e, tho' it were but an Old Woman and <HI>Water-Gruel,</HI> than this Bugbear <HI>Apothecary.</HI> This is fine Jargon, and without doubt will be very grateful to a Per&s;on tortur'd with a Fit of the <HI>Stone,</HI> or indeed in any other violent Pa|roxy&s;m or Convul&s;ion of Na|ture.</P>
<P>It is confe&s;s'd, that Nature is mo&s;t wi&s;e in all her Productions; and that if we will clo&s;ely attend to her, &s;he will never fail to Indi|cate to us the true way by which &s;he would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by us in her Labours. But this I take to be be|yond the Power and Addre&s;s of an Old Woman, or even of our Di&s;|pen&s;ary <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To &s;ay but one Word more of the Ingenuity of this mighty <HI>Au|thour;</HI> and that is, that all the Bu&s;tle
<PB N="19" REF="18">he has made in this Matter, aro&s;e from a private Quarrel between him and an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> who it &s;eems was a Man of too much Ho|nour, and of too tenacious a Temper for the Friend&s;hip of this worthy <HI>Phy&s;ician.</HI> When the&s;e things I &s;ay &s;hall be duly con&s;ider'd, I make no que&s;tion but the World will have ju&s;t &s;uch an opinion of him and his Performance as they both de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Apothecary</HI> is not obliged to the Receipts of the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> for his Knowledge in the <HI>Admini&s;tration of Medicines in the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> as the Vulgar fal&s;ly imagine, but goes to the &s;ame Fountain and Drinks as large and as pure Draughts of Know|ledge as him&s;elf: And &s;ince mo&s;t of us are ready to confe&s;s, that their Receipts have been &s;o far
<PB N="20" REF="19">from being a Direction to us, that they have rather prov'd <HI>Ignes Fatui</HI> to mi&s;lead us into tho&s;e Errours we have been guilty of, in relation to Practice.</P>
<P>Since the Pre&s;ent Learning and Labours of the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> are &s;o abundantly evident in this Town, that it would be perfectly needle&s;s for me to mention them.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we do, and can give Rea&s;ons equally with the <HI>Phy&s;ici|an,</HI> of the different Operations of Medicines us'd in the Cure of Di|&s;ea&s;es; Why are we thus Branded with the Opprobrious Names of <HI>Quacks, Mountebanks, Empiricks,</HI> and what not, by the Mouth of the Con&s;piracy, that Mighty Champion for the Cau&s;e, The Renowned Dr. <HI>Pitt. O Doctiorum puicquid e&s;t A&s;&s;urgite huic tam colen|do Nomini.</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible, It may be thought by what I have &s;aid, that I inten|ded to bring an Odium on the Manner of Education, as now Practic'd at the Univer&s;ities, and on tho&s;e Learned Gentlemen who have been Educated there. I &s;hall only beg leave to a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e Ho|nourable Foundations, for whom I have the Profounde&s;t Veneration, That I Contend for nothing but the bare Priviledge which our School-Learning Intitles us to, namely, the Under&s;tanding <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Authours, as well as the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> tho' we have not had the Plea&s;ure of being brought up under their Benign Tuition.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e truly Learned and Worthy <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> who have not departed from their Integrity, We are &s;o far from the thoughts of Interpo&s;ing in their Practice,
<PB N="22" REF="21">That We are, and always &s;hall be ready, as it is our Duty, to Re|commend and Introduce them, when ever it is in our Power.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> Have I An&s;wer'd Your Reque&s;t; and I hope have made it appear as much as the Brevity of this Letter will per|mit, that tho&s;e High Advantages you &s;eem &s;o fond of, are not &s;o Un|an&s;werable as You imagin'd; and that in reality, They are no more than Vain, Empty, Airy Notions, the Genuine Production of the Imagination of a Di&s;pen&s;ary <HI>Phy|&s;ician.</HI></P>
<P>As this is barely a <HI>Specimen</HI> of what I have to bring again&s;t You, when Lei&s;ure and Opportunity offer them&s;elves, I would de&s;ire You, as a Friend, in the mean time, to provide your &s;elf with a better Shield, to Ward off the
<PB N="23" REF="22">Blows of Your Adver&s;ary, than your Boa&s;ted Advantages are like to prove: And withal, that You will Publi&s;h Your Next, that the World may judge fairly the Merits of the Cau&s;e, and give the Crown to the Conquerour.</P>
