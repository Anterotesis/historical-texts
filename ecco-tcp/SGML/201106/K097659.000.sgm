<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the following Treatment of Fractured Legs (from the Ex|perience I have had of its Suc|ce&s;s during a Practice of &s;everal Years) ap|pears to me preferable to any I have hi|therto known; and as it may be a Means of le&s;&s;ening many of the Inconveniences attending &s;uch Accidents, I take the Liber|ty of &s;ending it for your Opinion; and, if you think it of Con&s;equence enough to be made public, &s;hall be glad to have it laid before the ROYAL SOCIETY.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument here recommended was fir&s;t applied, with great Succe&s;s, in an ob|lique Fracture of the TIBIA, (which could not be kept in a proper Situation by the u&s;ual Methods), and afterwards, as happily, in a
<PB N="4" REF="3">Di&s;location of the lower Extremity of the &s;ame Bone, accompanied with a Fracture of the FIBULA. In this latter Ca&s;e it is often difficult to reduce the Di&s;location, even with a &s;trong Exten&s;ion, and more &s;o to retain the Bones in their proper Situation, whil&s;t the Limb is laid in the u&s;ual extend|ed Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>But both the&s;e Difficulties are ab&s;olutely avoided by the Means I am about to de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The remarkable good Effects, in the Ca&s;es abovementioned, induced me to try the &s;ame in different Fractures of the Leg, as well compound as &s;imple, in all which I have found it to an&s;wer my Expectation. I have formerly explained this Method of treating Fractures to many Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion, as well as to your&s;elf, and have al&s;o had &s;everal Ca&s;es where other Surgeons have been cencerned with me, who have in general expre&s;&s;ed great Satis|faction,
<PB N="5" REF="4">(and &s;ome of them have introdu|ced it into their own Practice), &s;o that I have Rea&s;on to believe it would have be|come more general, if the In&s;truments, that have hitherto been &s;old for that Pur|po&s;e, had been made according to the ori|ginal Pattern; but the Workman, whom I employed, has made and &s;old many that differ from mine in &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Points. I have therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end you, inclo&s;ed, a De&s;cription of the In&s;tru|ment, made after &s;uch a Manner, as I have found by Experience to &s;ucceed be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION <HI>of a</HI> NEW-CONSTRUCT|ED INSTRUMENT <HI>for</HI> FRACTURED LEGS, <HI>recommended to be u&s;ed in&s;tead of the common Apparatus. See the Plate.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Figures are drawn on a Scale of three Inches to a Foot, and repre|&s;ent two Splints of &s;trong Pa&s;teboard made with Glue, to be fa&s;tened upon a fractured Leg, by three Straps which &s;urround the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e are adapted to the Leg of a mid|dle-&s;ized Man: neverthele&s;s it may be convenient to have two other Sizes; the one almo&s;t twenty-two Inches in Length, and the other &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>Fig. I. A repre&s;ents an under Splint of an irregular Form, &s;uitable to that Part of the Leg it is intended to cover; it is a little con|vex externally and concave internally. The Length eighteen Inches from (a) to (b).
<PB N="7" REF="6">The Width two Inches and three Quarters at the Strap near the Knee; and two Inches and a Quarter at both the other Straps.</P>
<P>B,B,B, three Leather Straps from fifteen to twenty Inches long and one wide, having two Rows of Holes &s;o placed, that every Hole in each Row may be oppo&s;ite to a Space in the other. The&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ewed fa&s;t to the Middle and Out&s;ide of the under Splint. The Portions of Straps (ddd) on the anterior Part of the Splint mu&s;t be &s;horter than tho&s;e on the po&s;terior (eee) which are to &s;urround the more mu&s;cular Part of the Leg.</P>
<P>C, a Part to &s;upport the Foot from the Point (a) to the Heel (c), five Inches long at an Angle of &s;ixty Degrees.</P>
<P>D, the Foot-&s;trap, twelve Inches long, &s;ewed to the Bottom of the under Splint, within two Inches of the Point, to pa&s;s un|der the Heel and through the Leather Loop on the upper Splint, to the lowe&s;t Pin.</P>
<P>E, an irregular oval Hole two Inches long and almo&s;t one wide in the lowe&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="7">Part, but decrea&s;ing upwards to receive the Malleolus externus, or lower Extremity of the Fibula.</P>
<P>Fig. II. repre&s;ents the Leg rai&s;ed up, to &s;hew the Situation of the under Splint when properly applied.</P>
<P>Fig. III. repre&s;ents a fractured Leg when laid within the Splints, according to the Method I am about to recommend, having the Stocking-Foot (or Sock) and Shoe upon it. The darke&s;t Shade in this and Fig. II. being intended to &s;hew that Part of the Splints within the Shoe.</P>
<P>Fig. IV. A, the upper Splint. B,B,B, the Pins. C, the Leather Loop to receive the Foot-Strap.</P>
<P>Fig. V. A many-tailed Bandage, made of Slips of Ru&s;&s;ia Linen, regularly increa&s;|ing in Length, from twelve or fourteen, to eighteen or twenty Inches, according to
<PB N="9" REF="8">the Size of the Leg. Each of the&s;e Slips (being two Inches broad) is &s;o laid as to cover Half the Breadth of that which is underneath it (<HI>viz.</HI> one Inch.) Another Slip, ten or twelve Inches long, is &s;ewed on the Back, &s;o as to unite them all in the Middle, making a Bandage equally as firm as a circular one, and which may be u&s;ed without di&s;turbing the Leg. The nar|rowe&s;t Part mu&s;t be placed neare&s;t to the Heel. As the Number of Slips is to be increa&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened, according to the Space nece&s;&s;ary to be inclo&s;ed within them, I call this a many-tailed Bandage, leaving the preci&s;e Number to be determined accord|ing to the Nature of the Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>This has been u&s;ed many Years in St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, in&s;tead of the old eighteen-headed Bandage: Neverthe|le&s;s, as it is not generally known, I hope this De&s;cription will not be thought &s;uper|fluous.</P>
<P>The three different Sizes of Splints above-mentioned will generally be &s;ufficient;
<PB N="10" REF="9">at lea&s;t one or other of them may &s;erve any Leg of an Adult till others can be provided.</P>
<P>The Legs of Children, as they are more round and le&s;s mu&s;cular, may be defended, nearly in the &s;ame Manner, with the com|mon wooden Splints, properly bol&s;tered, that are now made U&s;e of in St. Bartholo|mew's Ho&s;pital, provided they are long enough to &s;ecure both Articulations of the fractured Bones.</P>
<P>When a Surgeon is called to a fractured Leg, at the Place where the Accident hap|pened, let him lay the Patient on the in|jured Side, on a flat Surface, and rai&s;e the Knee of the fractured Limb towards the Abdomen, bending at the &s;ame Time the Knee-Joint, &s;o as to put the Exten&s;or-Mu&s;cles of the Foot (which are the &s;trong|e&s;t) into a State of Relaxation. He will then be enabled to replace the Ends of the fractured Bones, and re&s;tore them to their proper Situation, without the cu&s;tomary &s;trong Exten&s;ion of the Limb, which is trouble&s;ome to the Surgeon, painful to the
<PB N="11" REF="10">Patient, and apt to bring on Ten&s;ion, Spa&s;ms, and Inflammation of the &s;tretched Mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>When the Ends of the fractured Bone are replaced, (which may often be done even without removing the Shoe or Stock|ing,) let an under Splint, of the mo&s;t &s;uit|able Size, be applied to the Fibula, (or out&s;ide of the Leg,) and, if it does not fit exactly, let it be made to do &s;o, by adding &s;uch Compre&s;&s;es of Tow, or thick Flannel,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Or comb'd Wool.</NOTE> as may be nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This Po&s;ture is much more comfortable and convenient, (rendering it le&s;s trouble|&s;ome for the Patient to ea&s;e him&s;elf or be moved by others,) and removes the Foot and Toes out of the Way of being hurt by the Weight of the Bed-Cloathes, &s;o as to make a Fracture-Box or Cradle unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>If the Fracture be compound, the Wound generally heals by the fir&s;t Inten|tion, the great Impediment, (Irritation,) being prevented; of which I can produce many In&s;tances. Add to this, that the
<PB N="12" REF="11">Leg may be taken up with the whole Ap|paratus, and the Knee-Joint gently moved as often as nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent that Stiff|ne&s;s which always &s;ucceeds a Ca&s;e of this Kind, and is attended with much Pain and Inconvenience, a long Time after the Leg is otherwi&s;e well. The Patient may al&s;o be taken out of Bed frequently, without Pain or Danger, if not very heavy or unweildy.</P>
<P>The under Splint makes a &s;afe and &s;ecure Bed for the Leg whil&s;t the upper Part is dre&s;&s;ing, (if a compound Fracture,) and the Leg may, by a &s;teady Hand, be &s;up|ported al&s;o again&s;t the upper Splint, and put into any Po&s;ture that may be nece&s;&s;ary to dre&s;s a Sore on the Fibula, or under Part.</P>
<P>I do not always remove the Shoe and Stocking-Foot; as well becau&s;e they &s;erve to keep the Part in Per&s;piration, as that the Shoe adds Steadine&s;s to the Limb, by the Connection it may have with the inferior Part of the In&s;trument.</P>
<P>Let al&s;o the upper Splint be applied on the In&s;ide of the Leg, &s;o as almo&s;t to cover
<PB N="13" REF="12">the Tibia, on its whole Length. The Straps may then be fa&s;tened &s;ufficiently tight to &s;ecure the Whole. This done, the Patient may ea&s;ily be removed in a Sedan Chair, (having the Cu&s;hion &s;o rai&s;ed that the Leg may hang down without re&s;ting upon the Bottom,) or in a Coach, with the Limb &s;upported by the Hand of a Surgeon, &s;o that it may yield to every Motion uniformly, or all together, as it were, whil&s;t it &s;wings in his Hand; for it matters not how great the Motion of the Body be, provided the Points of the fractured Bone are &s;ecured from being moved, the one again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>In this Manner I have carried many Pa|tients, from the Place of the Accident, over the London Pavements, to their own Homes, at a great Di&s;tance, without their having &s;uffered any Inconvenience from the Motion, even when the Fractures were compound.</P>
<P>When the Patient is brought home and put to Bed, (the Bed having a Mattra&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="13">upon it,) let the Stocking be removed, and the proper Remedies, with the many|tailed Bandage and the above Splints, ap|plied, ob&s;erving the &s;ame Directions, as to Po&s;ture, which I have already given; <HI>viz.</HI> that the Patient be laid on his Side, with the broken Leg undermo&s;t, the Knee bent, and the Thigh drawn up, in&s;tead of laying him on his Back, with the injured Limb extended.</P>
<P>Both the Splints are, de&s;ignedly, made narrow, to leave Room for Examination of the Parts affected, le&s;t any undue Pre&s;&s;ure &s;hould occa&s;ion Pain; but if it &s;hould be objected that they are not &s;ufficiently broad for a thick Leg, that Inconvenience may be remedied by putting a Slip of Pa&s;teboard, or thin Wood, between them, on the fore Part of the Leg, if thought nece&s;&s;ary. The Straps of the In&s;trument are &s;ufficient to &s;e|cure the Whole.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some Per&s;ons have propo&s;ed, by Way of Improve|ment, to have a Rivet or Pin, like that upon the Tibial or upper Splint, fixed upon an Iron Plate near one End of the middle Strap, in&s;tead of having the Strap fixed to the fibular or under Splint, in Order that it may be ap|plied, as the Cale may require it; but I neverthele&s;s think it nece&s;&s;ary to be fixed as de&s;cribed in the Plate, to prevent the Splints from approaching or receding from each other, if either of the other Straps become too loo&s;e: though I approve very much of an additional Strap to be applied where&s;oever &s;uch Compre&s;&s;ion may be nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>I made, with my own Hand, the fir&s;t of the&s;e In&s;truments, of &s;trong Pa&s;teboard, with Iron Plates rivetted upon them, which &s;ucceeded very well. I have tried al&s;o va|rious Materials for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, &s;uch as &s;trong<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">About the Year 1748, Mr. <HI>Holmes,</HI> In&s;trument-Ma|ker to <HI>St. Bartholomew</HI>'s Ho&s;pital, made, by my Direc|tion, &s;ome Splints of this Shape of &s;trong Hide Leather hardened with Glew: But the extraordinary Expence, as well as the Difficulty of being &s;upplied with a &s;ufficient Quantity of them, induced me to continue the Splints of Pa&s;teboard made with Glew, in my con&s;tant Practice, which by long Experience I have found to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e effectually.</NOTE> Hide Leather, hardened with Glew; al&s;o Wood, and Plate Copper; any one of which will an&s;wer &s;ufficiently, if well formed: neverthele&s;s I &s;hall prefer the Pa&s;teboard, if made &s;trong enough, till I can meet with a Workman that will make them accurately of harder Materials.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>The &s;ame Po&s;ture that is recommended for broken Legs, I have found equally &s;er|viceable with Re&s;pect to broken Thighs, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. In which Ca&s;e the common wooden Splint is as good as any other, provided it be long enough to &s;ecure both Extremities of the fractured Bone.</P>
<P>I have, through the Whole of this De|&s;cription, made U&s;e of the Terms <HI>upper</HI> and <HI>under Splints,</HI> for the Sake of being more ea&s;ily under&s;tood; though perhaps the calling the one <HI>Tibiale,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or Tibial Splint.</NOTE> and the other <HI>Fibularium,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fibular Splint.</NOTE> would &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h them better, and give a more preci&s;e Idea of the Manner of their Application; the fir&s;t being placed &s;o as to cover a great Part of the <HI>Tibia,</HI> and the &s;econd forming a &s;afe Bed for the <HI>Fibula.</HI></P>
