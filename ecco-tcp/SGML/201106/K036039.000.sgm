<P>THE intention of the Author, under this genus Epilep&s;ia, is to de&s;cribe that di&s;ea&s;e which has been mo&s;t com|monly in this i&s;land, called the <HI>Falling Sick|ne&s;s:</HI> The rea&s;on why we chu&s;e to give it the title of Epilep&s;y is, it being the general Term now in u&s;e among&s;t the mo&s;t accurate and re|cent Sy&s;tematics: But before I attempt to enumerate the phaenomena and different &s;ymp|toms accompanying it, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to avoid the danger of its being con|founded with any other Genera, of the cla&s;s of Neuro&s;es of Dr. Cullen, or of the <HI>Spa&s;mi</HI> of Sauvage, to which it pertains; to give it a Definition, which I &s;hall endeavour to be as conci&s;e in as the matter will admit.</P>

<HEAD>DEFINITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Epilep&s;y is a di&s;ea&s;e of the convul&s;ive kind, returning periodically, affecting the ex|tremities with various and irregular motions; every &s;en&s;e, as well as the faculties of the mind, for a certain time are altogether obli|terated.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus defined the di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hall next endeavour to illu&s;trate its appearance more accurately in a detail of the particular &s;ymp|toms attending it; but as I have before re|marked that it is a periodical one, and as many circum&s;tances &s;hew the approach of the&s;e pe|riods, it &s;eems mo&s;t proper to take our fir&s;t ob&s;ervations from them. Before any one is &s;eized with an Epileptic Fit, as it is called, he or &s;he generally perceives the head to be in &s;ome degree affected by &s;tupor, or a kind of &s;wimming, which we expre&s;s by the name Vertigo; the countenance is &s;ometimes red and bloated, at other times in a collap&s;ed &s;tate, the eyes &s;parkle and appear highly excited, a &s;mall inflammation or red &s;pot is frequently perceived upon the white of them, increa&s;ing gradually till the time of acce&s;&s;ion; the cir|cumambient parts are con&s;iderably di&s;tended;
<PB N="7" REF="6">vi&s;ion is dimini&s;hed and vitiated in &s;ome de|gree, &s;ometimes indeed altogether ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Iris has very different appearances, &s;ometimes purple, at others black; the ears tingle, and &s;ounds are difficultly heard; di&s;|agreeable &s;mells and ta&s;tes are al&s;o perceived.</P>
<P>The patient's di&s;cour&s;e deviates much from what it is in health, being either quicker or &s;lower, and at this time &s;aliva is emitted from the mouth very copiou&s;ly; the jugular veins are enlarged, and at la&s;t a lo&s;s of &s;en&s;e takes place.</P>
<P>Neither are the parts below the&s;e altogether free from complaint, but are affected with &s;ymptoms common to other &s;pa&s;modic di&s;|ea&s;es, particularly tho&s;e of hy&s;teria and hypo|chondriari; but it frequently varies here, act|ing differently in different temperaments; &s;ometimes a pain is felt between the &s;houlders, the abdomen is drawn upwards, the tendons are convul&s;ed, the heart and extremities trem|ble, yawning and difficult re&s;piration &s;ucceed, the extremities grow cold, the penis is prae|ternaturally di&s;tended a &s;en&s;e of air or warm vapour is often perceived from the hypochon|dria, extremities or lowe&s;t parts, a&s;cending to the higher and to the &s;enorium.</P>
<P>The eructions al&s;o are very irregular, for be&s;ides the profu&s;ion of &s;aliva, which has been &s;poken of above, the dige&s;tions of the in|te&s;tines are foetid and very offen&s;ive, the urine
<PB N="8" REF="7">is al&s;o di&s;charged in greater quantity than is cu&s;tomary, and not &s;ufficiently elaborated.</P>
<P>Nocturnal emi&s;&s;ions of &s;emen frequently happen from &s;alacious dreaming, a &s;en&s;e of inflation is al&s;o perceived at the praecordia, the abdomen begins to &s;well and murmur, the appetite vitiated, requiring food either in too great or &s;mall quantity, &s;ome are excited by anger, others are depre&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow or fear; others again are di&s;tracted by anxious cares, &s;ome tran&s;ported by joy, by fooli&s;h and intemperate laughing; others within a &s;hort &s;pace of time run through all their different affections, &s;leep is either too profound or di&s;|turbed with terrifying dreams; the incubus or night-mare frequently is an addition to the&s;e calamities. By the increa&s;e of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, at la&s;t the occa&s;ion appears, by which the patient is pro&s;trated on the ground by a groan, all the &s;en&s;es and the faculty of the mind being abandoned.</P>
<P>Violent convul&s;ions &s;eize the whole body, the mu&s;cies of the face being differently di&s;|torted, &s;eem to expre&s;s different &s;en&s;es of the mind as tho&s;e of grief, joy, anger, love, &amp;c. there is al&s;o a violent grinding or grating of the teeth takes place, to &s;uch a degree as &s;ome|times to de&s;troy part of their extremities; it is not unu&s;ual for the tongue to protrude a little out of the mouth, and the clo&s;ing of the jaws frequently cau&s;e the teeth to cut it ex|ceedingly;
<PB N="9" REF="8">a livid appearance of the lips and under parts of the eyes takes place, which, in a &s;hort time, runs over the whole face; the palpebrae of the eyes are irregularly moved, but never are &s;o far con&s;tricted as to cover all the white; the mouth is dry, &s;parm prevail|ing in the beginning, afterwards it pours forth its &s;aliva, the &s;parm not being &s;olved; re&s;pi|ration is performed with the greate&s;t difficul|ty and labor, as if a per&s;on was actually under efforts of &s;trength, and the hands are clinched with great force, neither are the heart and ar|teries free from di&s;tre&s;s, the pul&s;ations of which are at fir&s;t quick and &s;mall, in a &s;hort time they become full and &s;low, not having their proper force, and can &s;carcely be numbered, wanting their regular order; after this the venis of the face, al&s;o the praecordia and abdomen begin to &s;well; the excretions are al&s;o con&s;iderably di&s;turbed, for in&s;tead of &s;a|liva, which was before very profu&s;ely &s;ecreted, a &s;oam ari&s;es in the mouth, al&s;o &s;tools, urine, &s;weat and &s;emen, are &s;pontaneou&s;ly evacuated, in an excited &s;y&s;tem, endued with great &s;en|&s;ibility; vomiting al&s;o happens &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;ymptoms by degrees begin to vani&s;h, and the Convale&s;cent Epileptic has not the appearance of death, or a moribund &s;tate, but a more natural &s;leep at la&s;t returns again; but yet not &s;o &s;ufficiently natural but that it
<PB N="10" REF="9">repre&s;ents Apoplexy. The breathing at la&s;t becomes le&s;s laborious; and a &s;hort &s;pace of time intervening, the patient, not con&s;cious of any thing that has happened, is re&s;tored to his natural &s;tate: it rarely occurs that a per|&s;on recovers immediately all his faculties, upon the paroxy&s;m &s;ub&s;iding; for generally there remains an inactivity to motion, in all the extremities, dullne&s;s of conception, pains of the head, and dimne&s;s of &s;ight; all which continue &s;ome time. &mdash; The times of in|terval between the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions are very diffe|rent; &s;ome are attacked every day, or &s;ome|times twice in the day; others once in the month; and others again, at a much greater di&s;tance of time; but the acce&s;&s;ions do not ob&s;erve regular periods, even in the &s;ame per|&s;on; and the continuance of the acce&s;&s;ion al&s;o differs greatly, &s;ome only being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for a few minutes, others whole days: and here we conclude our account of the &s;ymptoms attend|ing Epilep&s;y.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>REMOTE CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>THE different remote cau&s;es, and the ef|fects of tho&s;e vi&s;ible upon the brain of di&s;|&s;ected Epileptics, &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate, that Epilep&s;y mo&s;t frequently depends on a turgid &s;tate of the brain; the&s;e cau&s;es, whether they
<PB N="11" REF="10">act directly upon the brain, or primarily on another part of the body, are at la&s;t transfer|red to it, and there act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Bonetus, Morgagni, and Lieutaud.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that act within the brain may, as &s;ar as at pre&s;ent we have learnt from di&s;&s;ections, be properly re&s;erred to &s;ix heads: 1. Mecha|nical Stimuli&mdash;As a fractured cranium, and all ca&s;es of depre&s;&s;ion. 2. Chemical Sti|muli&mdash;Collections of acrid fluids. 3. Mat|ters preventing the free circulation of the blood, or proper action of the nerves, under which are comprehended tumor, o&s;&s;ifications, and compre&s;&s;ions. 4. Where the ve&s;&s;els of the brain are preternaturally filled with blood. 5. Effu&s;ions of blood. 6. Effu&s;ions of Se|rum.</P>
<P>It is obvious, beyond a doubt, that all the&s;e cau&s;es con&s;i&s;t in a full and turgid &s;tate of the brain, which is the fourth cau&s;e; and an in|crea&s;e of this, the fifth and the &s;ixth follows either of the&s;e, when no hydropic habit is pre&s;ent; which may be ea&s;ily detected by its &s;ymptoms, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from that &s;tate of turgi&s;cency which we are endeavouring to in|ve&s;tigate; an impeded circulation in the &s;inu|&s;es of the brain, or jugular veins, will cau&s;e the arterious blood to act with greater impe|tus, upon their exhalents, which will cau&s;e an effu&s;ion of &s;erum; and a &s;mall effu&s;ion in the
<PB N="12" REF="11">brain is more liable to do harm than in any other part; becau&s;e here we have no ab&s;orb|ents, and the veins only perform this office; &s;o that a &s;mall quantity of &s;erum effu&s;ed, mu&s;t accumulate by &s;tagnation for want of this ab|&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth cau&s;e is therefore an effect of the two foregoing; nor does the fir&s;t act imme|diately, unle&s;s by giving that full habit we have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ing, or in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by that, we are certain it does not give a more certain Epilep&s;y, and the cure of every Epilep&s;y coming from this origin, con&s;i&s;ts in a diminution of the full habit.&mdash;What per|tains to the &s;econd, I agree that acrid chemi|cal Stimuli are both obnoxious to, and capable of giving Epilep&s;y; but as &s;uch I deny its ca|pability of giving one where the paroxy&s;m is continued longer, and when the &s;timulus is pre&s;ent, and the fit has been more durable, and &s;erous colluvies found extrava&s;ated; I contend that it is the effect of the di&s;ea&s;e, and of the impetus of the blood, which before has been elucidated.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e is the only one remaining to be reconciled to our general opinion, under which are cla&s;&s;ed, hard tumors and con&s;ertions in the brain, impeding the free circulation through it: this is pretty well explained by the fir&s;t and &s;econd cau&s;e; &s;uch is a compre&s;|&s;ion of the &s;ofter parts into a praeternatural
<PB N="13" REF="12">hardne&s;s: this cau&s;e therefore &s;eems to me to act as a &s;timulus, quickening the circulation of the blood through its ve&s;&s;els; therefore this, as well as the fir&s;t cau&s;e, if not directly, yet in effect produces the plenitude nece&s;&s;ary for our propo&s;ition; and the &s;ame may be added with re&s;pect to the other four cau&s;es, which have been before enumerated, and properly reconciled, as terminating &s;imilarly.</P>
<P>The&s;e conclu&s;ions are or the greate&s;t advan|tage in practice, and clearly &s;hew us how we ought to dimini&s;h the Plethoric habit of Epi|leptics, and recommend ab&s;tinence: this is an excellent example of the u&s;e of di&s;&s;ections in inve&s;tigating proximate cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, though much neglected at pre&s;ent by phy|&s;icians.</P>
<P>Not that I mean to affirm, or give it as my opinion, that there is no Epilep&s;y but what depends on <HI>Plethora;</HI> many depend on inani|tion, others on neither cau&s;e: more are how|ever to be referred to it than at fir&s;t view we imagine.</P>
<P>I remember a ca&s;e of Epilep&s;y, remarked by my mo&s;t ingenious ma&s;ter and illu&s;trious pro|fe&s;&s;or, Dr. Cullen, at Edinburgh, which was brought on by fear; and yet before every re|turn of the paroxy&s;m an inflammation of one of the eyes was clearly perceived.</P>
<P>As we have gone pretty fully through the&s;e cau&s;es, which act within the Cranium, let us
<PB N="14" REF="13">endeavour, in order more certainly to e&s;tab|li&s;h the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, as depending on this plethoric &s;tate of the Brain, to &s;hew how cau&s;es originally acting el&s;ewhere, or at a di&s;tance, produce the &s;ame effects.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ions of different kinds, acting upon the &s;en&s;es in general, give Epilep&s;y, according to their degree of impul&s;e; they do not act as being of di&s;tinct or different kinds, but by force of impre&s;&s;ion, or reflect &s;en&s;ations, ex|cited (as they are called) and this may be re|conciled to all the &s;en&s;es, except that of &s;mell, upon which odours &s;eem to act parti|cularly; neither have the&s;e the power of act|ing, unle&s;s &s;ufficiently &s;trong. So a con&s;ider|able degree of pain, of any part&mdash;joy, and what is &s;till more, <HI>fear,</HI> which is carried to a degree of terror, have produced Epilep&s;y.&mdash;Terror acts more powerfully as a &s;timulus than joy; becau&s;e we are modified by nature to attend more peculiarly to tho&s;e motions of the mind, which free us from danger, than tho&s;e which elevate us to &s;udden pro&s;perity.&mdash;And why not? when we con&s;ider, that &s;ud|den de&s;truction is e&s;caped in one ca&s;e, and only tran&s;itory plea&s;ure acquired in the other.&mdash;Chemical Stimuli act al&s;o in like manner; &s;ome upon the whole &s;y&s;tem, others only on a particular part, as by &s;timulating the &s;to|mach; and the&s;e do not act &s;pecifically, but according to their &s;trength do they produce
<PB N="15" REF="14">Epilep&s;y.&mdash;Odours, indeed, as we have be|fore &s;aid, &s;eem to have a peculiar mode of action, and &s;ome other cau&s;es produce the di&s;|ea&s;e from encrea&s;ed irritability of the patient; as among children, dentition, calculi, and worms. And the&s;e cau&s;es act in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e within the brain, viz. by &s;timulating the brain to more violent motions, and quickening the circulation of the blood through it; which, from our former ob|&s;ervations, &s;eems to be the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of Epilep&s;y. But having before &s;aid, that Epilep&s;y might ari&s;e from a contrary &s;tate, we &s;hall run over the&s;e cau&s;es, as not being of &s;o much con&s;equence and impor|tance, with le&s;s preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Perturbations of the mind, by dimini&s;hing the action of the brain, produce a tempora|ry Epilep&s;y, quickly terminating in either death or health, as is ob&s;erved in the effects of great and &s;udden joy, or terror; but it would have been &s;ufficient only to have men|tioned the&s;e once, as they very commonly bring on death in a &s;imilar manner; as by Pal&s;y, Apoplexy, Syncope, and Convul&s;ions.&mdash;Some of the affections of the mind give a more con|tinued Epilep&s;y, and one more pertinent to our propo&s;ition, as Fear; which, by dimini&s;h|ing in a certain manner the mobility of the nervous power, &s;eems, by an inherent law in our &s;y&s;tem, to give in a certain ratio, a re|action
<PB N="16" REF="15">of the efforts of the brain, which is even greater than natural; or the remem|brance of this &s;ame cau&s;e of fear is often very &s;urficient to bring back the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;There is a fact of a pregnant woman being fatigued with trying a new gown, which by dimini&s;h|ing the excitement of the Sen&s;orium, gave that reaction nece&s;&s;ary for the production of an Epileptic fit; the &s;ight of which gown, for &s;ometime after, was &s;ufficient to renew the paroxy&s;m. Atonia of the &s;tomach &s;ome|times is &s;ufficient to give Epilep&s;y; &s;uch as is made by di&s;tention after eating, as is ob|&s;erved by Galen.&mdash;Fumes of Ipecacuana taken into the &s;tomach, are capable of producing the &s;ame effects; al&s;o Mercury, and many other matters; the Variolous contagion, induced by inoculation; and the Aura Epileptica, and finally, compre&s;&s;ion of the brain, which pro|duces Epilep&s;y, &s;uch as generally precedes Apoplexy or Pal&s;y.</P>
<P>There cau&s;es, from the effects, and method of cure, are very clearly &s;een to act, by giv|ing a &s;tate of the brain, contrary to excite|ment, which we chu&s;e to call by the name Collap&s;e; but then the&s;e act very rarely when compared with the former; neither do they e&s;&s;entially deviate from our propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>From innumerable di&s;&s;ections of Lieutaud, Morgagni, and others, of Epileptic patients; al&s;o in the opinion of the greate&s;t characters in
<PB N="17" REF="16">Phy&s;ic, Albertinius and Ho&s;&s;man, and many others, truly honoured and e&s;teemed for their practice, it appears, that they, for the mo&s;t part, frequently treated Epilep&s;y as a di&s;ea&s;e &s;trictly connected with Plethora; and this al&s;o particularly agrees with the opinions and doctrines of my late mo&s;t worthy Ma&s;ter and In&s;tructor, Doctor Cullen, of Edinburgh, Pro|fe&s;&s;or of the In&s;titutes and Practice of Phy&s;ic; whole name I am at a lo&s;s for words to adorn with that reverence, gratitude, and affection, that it demands of me; but will always en|deavour to keep it in view in my practice.&mdash;I am al&s;o of opinion, that this turge&s;cent &s;tate, which we have been endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, will, argued fairly, mo&s;t ea&s;ily in|ve&s;tigate the nature and cure of the Epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>For the more clear and accurate elucida|tion of the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, let us con&s;ider tho&s;e habits that are mo&s;t pre|di&s;po&s;ed to it.&mdash;Tho&s;e Sy&s;tems inclined to Epilep&s;y, are generally endowed with encrea&s;|ed mobility: by this I mean per&s;ons &s;ubject to &s;udden, irregular and violent motions of the mind; and is it not highly probable, that the &s;tate of the brain in the&s;e habits, which is moved by every impul&s;e of &s;timuli, and every change of ten&s;ion, is &s;imilar?</P>
<P>This mobility is encrea&s;ed by repetition, and, after &s;ometime, become habitual, and al|mo&s;t natural, according to the law of irrita|bility,
<PB N="18" REF="17">(by which I mean the power of con|traction of mu&s;cles) it is encrea&s;ed and fa|cilitated by motion.&mdash;This explains the rea|&s;on why, after one paroxy&s;m others can be produced by le&s;s active and weaker &s;timuli, and &s;eems as if they were produced even &s;pon|taneou&s;ly; for which rea&s;on it has been called a voluntary and feigned di&s;ea&s;e. This mobi|lity a&s;&s;i&s;ts us much in the inve&s;tigation of the proximate cau&s;e of every Epilep&s;y.&mdash;There are two cau&s;es of mobility:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Debility of mu&s;cular fibres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Exce&s;s of ten&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fir&s;t cau&s;e is clearly elucidated in in|fants, who are particularly obnoxious to Epi|leptic fits, a debile &s;tate of mu&s;cular fibres, or of the original &s;tamina, can give &s;uch a cer|tain condition of the nervous power, which makes it more adapted to irregular motions, which we call encrea&s;ed mobility: but per|haps this rea&s;oning may appear too &s;ubtile; &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s to the other cau&s;e of mobi|lity, viz.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of ten&s;ion.&mdash;This giving mobility, remains by &s;ome means now more clearly to be explained. Stretching fibres beyond their tone, gives encrea&s;e of mobility: &s;o fibres immoderately di&s;tended by the Potentiae No|centes;
<PB N="19" REF="18">&s;uch as exerci&s;e, heat, drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c. e&s;pecially in a Plethoric &s;y&s;tem; when the force of the&s;e is removed, they immediate|ly relax them&s;elves, in a certain ratio, as they have been before di&s;tended; and in like man|ner are their o&s;cillations encrea&s;ed; which re|mi&s;&s;ion, or relaxation, mu&s;t frequently nece&s;|&s;arily take place in the brain.&mdash;This ten&s;ion, which depends on the quantity and impetus of the humours, frequently remits; an ex|planation of which, by an example of an ela&s;|tic cord, may perhaps render it more ea&s;y to conceive: if &s;uch a cord is extended, by force or by any weight, to a certain length, it will require a greater force, or weight, to &s;tretch it as much more, than was at fir&s;t applied: and in a ratio, according to the degree of di&s;ten|&s;ion, &s;o will be the re&s;ilition, the di&s;tending power being removed: or, I may explain the &s;ame thing by a pendulum; as far as you re|move it by the hand from the center of gra|vity in one direction, giving it liberty, it will, in a certain ratio, go &s;o much farther from it on the rever&s;e &s;ide.&mdash;A full, turgid &s;tate of the brain is analogous to this; the o&s;cillations of which are produced either &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or by faults occuring el&s;ewhere; as Plethora al|ways encrea&s;es it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this cau&s;e of Epilep&s;y, con&s;i&s;t|ing in the excitement of the brain, or in its greater o&s;cillations, that is exce&s;s of ten&s;ion
<PB N="20" REF="19">connected with debility; a defect of ten&s;ion, debility being pre&s;ent, will produce the &s;ame effects.&mdash;This is a peculiar law of our &s;y&s;tem; as excitement produces Collap&s;e, &s;o, in return, does &s;edative powers produce Excitements.&mdash;For the motions of our minds run into con|trary extremes.&mdash;Terror produces this di&s;ea&s;e by exciting the brain; but in a &s;hort time it produces a contrary &s;tate, the impetus being a little moderated. Exqui&s;ite titillation brings about the &s;ame phaenomenon, as is ob&s;erved by Ari&s;totle:
<Q>Omne animal po&s;t coitum tri&s;te.</Q></P>
<P>And other &s;edative cau&s;es act in like manner. We &s;hall however leave the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and pa&s;s to the cure of Epilep&s;y, depending on a turge&s;cent &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain.</P>

<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE indications of Cure &s;eem to be Two:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To avoid occa&s;ional cau&s;es.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To obviate a full habit.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. All exciting cau&s;es are particularly to be guarded again&s;t; &s;o every thing that induces plethora, is &s;trictly to be forbid, as animal food, and matters that are highly nutritious; al&s;o whatever has the power of determining the blood to the head, as the rays of the &s;un acting upon it, heat of the bed, favoured by the horizontal po&s;ition, bathing, exerci&s;e, drunkenne&s;s, and anger, and whatever is ca|pable of inducing vertigo; as viewing of ob|jects from eminencies, venery, &s;trong im|pul&s;es,
<PB N="22" REF="21">as &s;udden noi&s;es, &s;tridor of the hinge of a door, commotions of the mind, remem|brance of the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ight of other patients labouring under the &s;ame paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">II. By the &s;econd indication of Cure, is in|tended not only to obviate the increa&s;e of a full habit, but al&s;o to dimini&s;h that which is pre&s;ent; for which purpo&s;es the following method &s;eems to me mo&s;t advantageous.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Blood letting: This is peculiarly ef|ficacious, where the di&s;ea&s;e chiefly &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in ten&s;ion, and a few ounces drawn will an&s;wer the intent; but when &s;igns of conge&s;tion appear in the head, as by acute pain, tumor, or any inflammation, then blood is to be drawn plentifully; and for this rea|&s;on I advi&s;e a large quantity to be taken at once, becau&s;e it is not &s;o &s;oon repaired; and as we know from fact that nothing more en|crea&s;es plethora than frequent &s;mall bleedings, performed periodically, the &s;y&s;tem being ac|cu&s;tomed to lo&s;e a certain quantity of blood at particular times, always provides for &s;uch a lo&s;s: therefore, from the rea&s;ons above, it is &s;ufficienity clear, by &s;mall repeated bleed|ings we increa&s;e that habit we wi&s;h to obviate. And this remedy may be u&s;ed with greater advantage when we are acquainted, by any
<PB N="23" REF="22">&s;ymptoms, of an approaching acce&s;&s;ion; up|on the appearance of which, I would very freely immediately draw blood from a vein. I &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be very cautious of inducing a Deliquium Animi, and this for two rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, Le&s;t I &s;hould be fru&s;trated in my intent as to quantity; and 2dly, As by this there is &s;ome danger to be apprehended of inducing an acce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This then may be the rule, to bleed while the &s;trength of the patient remains favorable. Should not this prove &s;ufficient, which I am in hopes it would, then leeches, or cupping gla&s;&s;es, may be applied to the temples, as ne|ce&s;&s;ity requires.</P>
<P>Second, Purgatives: The action of the&s;e is accompanied with &s;timulus; and if this be a general one, often does as much harm as good: we &s;hould always, in this ca&s;e, pay particular attention that this &s;timulus be as much confined to the alimentary canal as po&s;|&s;ible; which may have good effect in altering the determination from the head, which be|fore we elucidated to be &s;o generally the ca&s;e with Epileptics.</P>
<P>The&s;e act by exciting the peri&s;taltic mo|tion of the inte&s;tines, and thus occa&s;ioning a di&s;charge of their contents; al&s;o by emul|ging the &s;everal excretions, which is a greater evacuation than the former: hence purgatives
<PB N="24" REF="23">mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable power in depleting the &s;y&s;tem, and dimini&s;hing its ten&s;ion, which we have &s;hewed to abound in Epilep&s;y; I would, however, recommend tho&s;e of the milder kind; &s;uch as neutral Salts, Senna, Manna, Rhubarb, Ca&s;tor&mdash;Oil, &amp;c. as mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>Third, I&s;&s;ues and Setons: The&s;e by di&s;|charging the coagulable lymph, are, without doubt, u&s;eful again&s;t a full habit; as this is the part of our fluids which forms Pus, that we &s;ee evacuated by the&s;e emunctories, which are generally placed in the neighbourhood of the &s;y&s;tem, where the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e acts: hence, in Epilep&s;y, the mo&s;t proper part for an I&s;&s;ue or Seton, is the nape of the neck.</P>
<P>The&s;e remedies, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, are &s;uffici|ent either to cure, or, at lea&s;t, to alleviate the di&s;ea&s;e: yet I would not recommend a long u&s;e of them; &s;ince the &s;y&s;tem being inured to this evacuation, from cu&s;tom and habit, a&s;&s;imilates an increa&s;ed quantity of co|agulable nymph, in order to &s;upply the di&s;|charge of pus, analogous to frequent blood lettings increa&s;ing plethora.&mdash;So the longer we continue the&s;e evacuations, the le&s;s e&s;&s;en|tial are the effects.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper method after the u&s;e of the&s;e means, to obviate a full habit, is,</P>
<PB N="25" REF="24">
<P>Fourth, Ab&s;tinence: This is highly effec|tual again&s;t the cau&s;e of Epilep&s;y, con&s;equent|ly again&s;t a turgid &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e; and certain|ly more Epileptics are cured by this, than all other remedies; and whatever advantages may ari&s;e from the u&s;e of the above evacua|tions, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the patient ob&s;erve &s;tri&s;t regularity in the non-naturals, and adhere inviolably to the antiphlogi&s;tic re|gimen, for a con&s;iderable length of time, and perhaps through life.</P>
<P>In Epilep&s;y, ari&s;ing from debility, the fol|lowing indication of cure &s;eems mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>To obviate mobility of the nervous power.</P>
<P>This takes place in a lax &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, and is relieved by tonics and anti&s;pa&s;modics: there is doubt in the former from the difficul|ty in the admini&s;tration. In the vegetable kingdom, there are &s;ome plants abound pecu|liarly with an a&s;tringent quality, as the bark of oak, which has been thought to act &s;peci|fically in this di&s;ea&s;e; perhaps commended enthu&s;ia&s;tically, as it is very uncertain.&mdash;The vegetables where the bitter and a&s;trin|gent qualities are connected, are the mo&s;t powerful; as in the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<HEAD>PERUVIAN BARK.</HEAD>
<P>And this is not admini&s;tered with &s;o much propriety to a full plethoric habit, as to re|move mobility of the nervous power; for it certainly is injurious to &s;y&s;tems accompa|nied with the haermorrhagic or inflammato|ry Diathe&s;is: And, as this di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes fluctuates from the mobility ari&s;ing from tur|ge&s;cency, to that from laxity, particularly con|nected with the nervous &s;y&s;tem; in this &s;tate we may admit it as a mo&s;t powerful remedy, e&s;pecially where the acce&s;&s;ions ob&s;erve regular periods; as we know the bark hath particular qualities of removing periodical di&s;ea&s;es, as is clearly elucidated in the phaenomena of inter|mittents, and that it has very trifling powers, unle&s;s given very nigh to the approach of a paroxy&s;m. Hence it appears, that the in|di&s;criminate manner in which the Bark has been pre&s;cribed, is the rea&s;on of its being ex|ploded by many in practice: It however, with &s;ome ju&s;tice may be &s;aid, that the Je&s;uit who fir&s;t &s;hewed the u&s;e of this mo&s;t noble medi|cine, hath &s;ufficiently compen&s;ated for the crimes of the whole fraternity.&mdash;Now we go to</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="27" REF="26">
<HEAD>METALLIC TONICS.</HEAD>
<P>Which are more powerful than all the ve|getable, except the Peruvian Bark, and
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Ar&s;enic.&mdash;This is dangerous, although much commended.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Tin.&mdash;This is &s;aid to have had good effects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Iron.&mdash;This is &s;ufficiently &s;afe; but if chalybeate waters have alleviated Epilep&s;ies, they have done this not &s;o much from their tonic power, as from the effects that &s;ucceed cold bathing, exerci&s;e, and cold air, in ge|neral.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Copper.&mdash;This is perhaps an u&s;eful me|dicine again&s;t Epilep&s;y, and it is much to be lamented, that we are not particularly ac|quainted with that compo&s;ition of it that proved &s;o remarkably effectual, and which is recorded by Baron Van Swieten, the form of which he him&s;elf is ignorant of; but, mo&s;t probably, it may depend on this circum&s;tance, pre&s;erving the tonic power of the Copper, and rejecting altogether its &s;timulating quali|ties, which may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be obviated by joining a neutral, in&s;tead of an acid, with the Copper; which is done in the Cuprum Ammoniacale, now in u&s;e in Epileptic ca&s;es; con&s;i&s;ting merely of Copper connected with the Sal Ammoniacum. This compo&s;ition has very &s;trong advocates.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="28" REF="27">
<HEAD>COLD BATHING.</HEAD>
<P>This alone hath frequently been recom|mended as a cure in Epileptic ca&s;es; and wherever it has been of &s;ervice, I &s;hould imagine it to be in tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems where the mobility of the nervous power is con&s;iderably increa&s;ed; but injurious in tho&s;e where the inflammatory or plethoric Diathe&s;is prevails.</P>
<P>The method of u&s;ing the Cold Bath &s;hould be, either by the patient going in head fore|mo&s;t, or by cold water being fir&s;t thrown upon his head; as in this manner it is mo&s;t likely to be effectual.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANTISPASMODICS.</HEAD>
<P>To enter formally into a &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e would be a work of time, and require much experiment and ob&s;ervation, to &s;hew with accuracy their modus operandi; but we can, in general, &s;ay of the&s;e, they &s;carcely merit the prai&s;e attributed to them.&mdash;We &s;hall &s;peak of tho&s;e chiefly recommended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PEONY and VALERIAN.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e have long been held very efficacious in the cure of Epilep&s;y; the former of which has been extolled even to ab&s;urdity; many having credulity enough to believe, that the
<PB N="29" REF="28">root of this plant worn about the neck only, was very &s;erviceable in this di&s;ea&s;e; but its great u&s;e, I own my&s;elf unacquainted with, therefore pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>Many phy&s;icians have a&s;cribed great prai&s;e to Valerian; but I have been informed by a mo&s;t eminent profe&s;&s;or at Edinburgh, who has been very much engaged in the practice of phy&s;ick for thirty years pa&s;t, who declared he had only &s;een it of &s;ervice in one or two ca&s;es; and when that takes place, it acts merely as a purgative, de&s;titute of any anti|&s;pa&s;modic qualities.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANIMAL OIL.</HEAD>
<P>This has been highly celebrated among&s;t the Germans, which is the Empyreumatic oil of animals, highly purified by di&s;tillation, which de&s;troys the original di&s;agreeable odour, and renders it thin and limpid, of a &s;ubtile, penetrating, not di&s;agreeable &s;mell and ta&s;te; its volatility is &s;o great, that it gives all its power to the air; for which rea&s;on, if there is any hopes of advantage in volatile medi|cines, it may ju&s;tly be expected from this; and the te&s;timony of many confirm the fact.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="30" REF="29">
<HEAD>MOSCH.</HEAD>
<P>This is the mo&s;t &s;ubtile of all, and there|fore ought to be &s;cattered upon the whole body; if its powers are obvious in the cure of hydrophobia, it ought from &s;imilitude of rea&s;oning to appear in Epilep&s;y, and its fame is every where divulged; but it is found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give it in large do&s;es to an&s;wer the intent, which may be owing to our very rarely meeting with this medicine pure, and there|fore being uncertain of its efficacy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AETHER.</HEAD>
<P>This is not altogether u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e of its volatility rendering it capable of being dif|fu&s;ed through the whole &s;y&s;tem; and there|fore it is not to be altogether rejected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>OPIUM.</HEAD>
<P>This has been condemned by many in the cure of Epilep&s;y. Two very illu&s;trious names in phy&s;ick, De Haen and Morgagni, have com|mended it, but without giving any &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their opinion. De Haen relates a particular ca&s;e, where the acce&s;&s;ion u&s;ed to return during &s;leep; and he declares that many paroxy&s;ms were obviated by the u&s;e of
<PB N="31" REF="30">opium, the &s;lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e having &s;uf|ficiently indicated their approach. This is very little to the purpo&s;e; neither is the rea|&s;oning of Morgagni &s;ufficiently probable.&mdash;In my own opinion opium acts here as a tonic, and being given at a happy cri&s;is before the ac|ce&s;&s;ion, by that means obviates it.&mdash;Certainly if ever it is to be admitted in &s;pa&s;modic con|vul&s;ions or Epilep&s;ies, it ought to be admitted as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to the acce&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e of its quickly lo&s;ing its power; and this being over, it always leaves the &s;y&s;tem more ir|ritable. Its inebriating quality on the one hand quickens the circulation to the head, and debilitates and irritates in con&s;equence; &s;o, on the other hand, its being given in &s;uch quantity, and at &s;uch a particular time, to obviate an acce&s;&s;ion by dimini&s;hing the ner|vous mobility, or to be more particular the mobility of the nervous power, in which &s;pa&s;ms con&s;i&s;t. But this power of opium does not appear &s;o clearly in a pure idiopathic Epi|lep&s;y, where the brain it&s;elf is the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, as in one ari&s;ing from irritation of the &s;y&s;tem in general, or of a particular part.&mdash;But in fact, the ra&s;h u&s;e of it in the former ca&s;e is &s;carcely compen&s;ated for, by the more prudent u&s;e of it in the latter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="32" REF="31">
<HEAD>HYOCYAMUS.</HEAD>
<P>The action of this plant is not unlike that of opium, only that it does not leave the belly &s;o con&s;tipated; this advantage alone be|ing admitted, it is either (notwith&s;tanding the high character given of it by Dr. Stork) not to be given at all, or with the &s;ame re&s;tric|tions as opium, in Epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>This indication for the removing mobility, contains a great many remedies; the u&s;e of which in a plethoric &s;y&s;tem would be altoge|ther ab&s;urd, and are adapted &s;imply to mobi|lity, accompanied with debility; but as this frequently in time &s;ucceeds the other, &s;o mu&s;t we practi&s;e accordingly.&mdash; We may add a fourth indication for the convale&s;cent &s;tate.</P>
<P>To obviate altogether an habitual Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This is chiefly done by avoiding occa&s;ional cau&s;es; a little fuller diet may be admitted; this di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes varies in &s;uch a man|ner, that to tho&s;e where ab&s;tinence hath been &s;trictly commanded, a fuller diet comes in for a remedy, after a few years. I &s;ay here, a more liberal regimen, not ab&s;olutely a full regimen; for irritability of the nervous and &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem is particularly to be at|tended to.&mdash;A generous gla&s;s of wine may be
<PB N="33" REF="32">admitted, but not in quantity to inebriate, as a little &s;trengthens and nouri&s;hes the body without irritating it, which effect has con|&s;iderable power again&s;t the very production of mobility.&mdash;Sleep ought to be enjoyed tem|perately, which is mo&s;t adapted to corrobo|rating the body.&mdash;Let the degree of the at|mo&s;phere, if it can be &s;o contrived, be under 64 of Farenheit's Thermometer, rather than above.</P>
<P>All the&s;e may be varied di&s;cretionally, ac|cording to the &s;tate of the convale&s;cents. This alteration being properly and &s;kilfully managed, other remedies being le&s;s efficacious, and the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf not being &s;o well in|ve&s;tigated, is highly beneficial; which is a maxim from the time of Hippocrates down to the pre&s;ent.</P>
