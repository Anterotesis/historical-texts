<HEAD>SECT. I. The NATURE of the DISORDER.</HEAD>
<P>TO call the Hypochondria&s;is a fanciful complaint, is ignorant and cruel. It is a real, and a &s;ad di&s;ea&s;e; an ob|&s;truction of the &s;pleen by thickened and di&s;|tempered blood; extending it&s;elf often to the liver, and other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent. Phy&s;ic has &s;carce known a Di&s;order more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.</P>
<P>The blood is a mixture of many fluids; which, in a &s;tate of health, are &s;o combined, that the whole pa&s;&s;es freely through its ap|pointed ve&s;&s;els: but if by the lo&s;s of the
<PB N="4" REF="3">thinner parts, the re&s;t becomes too gro&s;s to be thus carried through, it will &s;top where the circulation has lea&s;t power; and having thus &s;topped, it will accumulate; heaping by degrees ob&s;truction on ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>Health, chearfulne&s;s, and the quiet exer|ci&s;e of the mind, depend upon a perfect cir|culation: is it a wonder then, when this be|comes impeded, the body lo&s;es of its health, and the temper of its &s;prightline&s;s? to be otherwi&s;e would be the wonder: and he in|humanly in&s;ults the afflicted, who calls this change a voluntary frowardne&s;s. The &s;lighte&s;t &s;tate of this ob&s;truction brings with it &s;ick|ne&s;s, angui&s;h, and oppre&s;&s;ion; and innumera|ble ills follow its advancing &s;teps; unle&s;s prevented by a timely care; till life it&s;elf grows burthen&s;ome.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was common in antient Greece; and her phy&s;icians under&s;tood it, better than tho&s;e perhaps of later times, in any other country; who, though happy in many ad|vantages, which the&s;e fathers of the &s;cience could not have, yet want the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance of frequent watching the di&s;ea&s;e in all its &s;tages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e venerable writers have delivered its nature; and its cure: in the fir&s;t, every ob|&s;ervation at this time &s;hews they were right;
<PB N="5" REF="4">and what they have &s;aid as to the latter will be found equally ju&s;t and true. All this, &s;o far as pre&s;ent experience has confirmed it, and no farther, will be here laid before the afflicted in a few plain words.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. PERSONS &s;ubject to it.</HEAD>
<P>FATIGUE of mind, and great exer|tion of its powers often give birth to this di&s;ea&s;e: and always tend to encrea&s;e it. The finer &s;pirits are wa&s;ted by the labour of the brain: the Philo&s;opher ri&s;es from his &s;tudy more exhau&s;ted than the Pea&s;ant leaves his drudgery; and this, without the benefit he has from exerci&s;e. Greatne&s;s of mind, and &s;teady virtue; determined re&s;olution, and manly firmne&s;s, when put in action, and intent upon their object, all lead to this di&s;ea&s;e: perhaps whatever tends to the en|nobling of the &s;oul, has at lea&s;t an equal &s;hare in bringing on this weakne&s;s of the body.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>Hence we may learn ea&s;ily who are the per&s;ons mo&s;t &s;ubject to it: the grave and &s;tudious; tho&s;e of a &s;edate temper and en|larged under&s;tanding; the learned and wi&s;e; the virtuous and the valiant: tho&s;e whom it would be the intere&s;t of the world to wi&s;h were free from this and every other illne&s;s; and who perhaps, except for this alloy, would have too large a &s;hare of human hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e are mo&s;t, it is not the&s;e alone, who are liable to the di&s;order. There are countries where it is endemial; in other places many have the &s;eeds of it in their con&s;titution; and in &s;ome it takes its ri&s;e from accidents. In the&s;e la&s;t the complaint is the ea&s;ie&s;t of cure; and in the fir&s;t mo&s;t difficult.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the Greeks here named, the Jews of old were heavily afflicted with this evil; and in their de&s;cendants to the pre&s;ent day it is often con&s;titutional: the Spaniards have it almo&s;t to a man; and &s;o have the American Indians. Perhaps the character of the&s;e &s;e|veral nations may be connected with it: the &s;teady honour, and firm valour of the Spa|niard, very like that of the ancient Doric nation, who followed the &s;ober flute and not the &s;prightly trumpet to the field; and met the enemy, not with &s;houts and fury, but
<PB N="7" REF="6">with a determined virtue; is perhaps ally'd to this con&s;titution: it is the character of the Hypochondriac to be &s;edate and temperate, but unmoveably re&s;olved: the Jew has &s;hewn this, mi&s;takenly indeed; but a&s;toni&s;hingly; and the poor Indian, untaught as he is, faces all peril with compo&s;ure; and &s;ings his death|&s;ong with unalter'd countenance.</P>
<P>Among particular per&s;ons the inquiring and contemplative are tho&s;e who &s;uffer mo&s;t by this di&s;ea&s;e; and of all degrees of men I think the clergy. I do not mean the hunt|ing, &s;hooting, drinking clergy, who follow the tables of the great; but the retir'd and con&s;cientious; &s;uch as attend in midnight filence to their duty; and &s;eek in their own cool brea&s;ts, or where&s;oever el&s;e they may be found, new admonitions for an age plunged in new vices. To this di&s;ea&s;e we owe the irreparable lo&s;s of Dr. YOUNG; and the pre&s;ent danger of many other men, the be&s;t and mo&s;t approved among&s;t us.&mdash;May what is here to be propo&s;ed, prevent a lo&s;s truly irre|parable!</P>
<P>The Geometrician, or the learned enquirer, of whatever denomination, who&s;e cour&s;e of &s;tudy fixes his regard for ever on one object; his mind inten&s;ely and continually employed upon one point, ought to be timely warned al&s;o that he is in danger; or if he find him&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="7">already afflicted, he &s;hould be reminded that the &s;ame cour&s;e of life, which brought on the di&s;order, will, without care, encrea&s;e it to the mo&s;t dreaded violence.</P>
<P>The middle period of life is that wherein there is mo&s;t danger of an attack from this di&s;ea&s;e: and the latter end of autumn, when the &s;ummer heats have a little time been over, or early &s;pring, when we fir&s;t feel the &s;un, are the &s;ea&s;ons when, in our climate, its fir&s;t a&s;&s;aults are mo&s;t to be expected. The &s;ame periods of the year always increa&s;e the di&s;|order al&s;o in tho&s;e who have been before afflicted with it: and it is a truth which mu&s;t however unwillingly be confe&s;&s;ed, that from its fir&s;t attack the patient grows continually, though &s;lowly, wor&s;e; unle&s;s a watchful re|gimen prevent it.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutions mo&s;t liable to this ob|&s;truction are, the lean and dark complexion|ed; the grave and &s;edentary. Let &s;uch be aware of the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms; and obviate, (as they may then with ea&s;e) that which it will be much more difficult to remove.</P>
<P>It is happy that a di&s;ea&s;e, wherein the pa|tient mu&s;t do a great deal for him&s;elf, falls, for the mo&s;t part, upon tho&s;e who have the powers of rea&s;on &s;tronge&s;t. Let them only be con&s;cious of this; that the di&s;temper na|turally
<PB N="9" REF="8">di&s;po&s;es them to inactivity; and that the be&s;t rea&s;on will have no force unle&s;s ac|companied with re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Though the phy&s;ician can do &s;omething in the cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e, much more depends upon the patient: and here his con&s;tancy of mind will be employed mo&s;t happily. None can be better qualified to judge, on a fair hearing, what cour&s;e it is the mo&s;t fit that he &s;hould take; and having made that choice, he mu&s;t with patience wait its good effects. Di&s;ea&s;es that come on &s;lowly will take up time in curing: an attention to the fir&s;t ap|pearances of this di&s;order will be always hap|pie&s;t; becau&s;e when lea&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed it is mo&s;t ea&s;ily overthrown: but when that happy pe|riod has been neglected, the Sick mu&s;t wait the effects of &s;uch a cour&s;e as will dilute and melt the ob&s;tructing fluid gradually; for till that be done it is not only vain, but &s;ometimes dangerous, to attempt an expul&s;ion of it from the body.</P>
<P>The blood readily &s;eparates into gro&s;&s;er and thinner parts: we &s;ee this even in bleeding; and from the toughne&s;s of the red cake from that operation, may gue&s;s how difficult it will be to di&s;&s;olve &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tance, though of le&s;s firmne&s;s, in the ve&s;&s;els of the body. That the blood can thus become thickened within the body, every Pleuri&s;y &s;hews us too evidently: in
<PB N="10" REF="9">that di&s;ea&s;e it is brought on &s;uddenly, and with inflammation; in the other, &s;lowly and with|out: and in this la&s;t ca&s;e, even before it forms the ob&s;truction, can bring on many mi&s;chiefs. Various cau&s;es may produce the &s;ame effect, but that in all ca&s;es operates mo&s;t durably, which begins mo&s;t &s;lowly. The watery part of the blood is its milder part; in the re|maining gro&s;s matter of it, are acrid &s;alts and burning oils; and the&s;e, when de&s;titute of that happy dilution which nature gives them in a healthy body, are capable of doing the greate&s;t mi&s;chief to the tender ve&s;&s;els in which they are kept &s;tagnant.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. The SYMPTOMS of the DISORDER.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and lighte&s;t of the &s;igns that &s;hew this illne&s;s are a lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and inaptitude to motion, a di&s;reli&s;h of amu&s;ements, a love of &s;olitude and a ha|bit of thinking, even on trifling &s;ubjects, with too much &s;teadine&s;s. A very little help may combat the&s;e: but if that indo|lence,
<PB N="11" REF="10">which is indeed a part of the di&s;order, will continue to neglect them; wor&s;e mu&s;t be expected &s;oon to follow.</P>
<P>Wild thoughts; a &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s, weight, and oppre&s;&s;ion in the body; a want of ap|petite, or, what is wor&s;e, an appetite without dige&s;tion; for the&s;e are the varying condi|tions of different &s;tates of the di&s;ea&s;e: with the&s;e will come on a fullne&s;s, and a diffi|culty of breathing after meals, a &s;traitne&s;s of the brea&s;t, pains and flatulencies in the bowels, and an unaptne&s;s to di&s;charge their contents.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e then becomes low, weak, and unequal; and there are frequent palpitations of the heart: a little dark-coloured urine is voided at &s;ome times; and a flood of colour|le&s;s and in&s;ipid water at others; relieving for a moment, but not affecting the di&s;tem|per: there is in &s;ome ca&s;es al&s;o a continual teazing cough, attended with a choaking &s;toppage in the throat at times; then heart|burn, &s;ickne&s;s, hardne&s;s of the belly; with a co&s;tive habit or continual tormenting and vain irritation.</P>
<P>The lips will now turn pale; and the eyes lo&s;e their brightne&s;s; and by degrees the whites will grow as it were greeni&s;h: the gums by this time want their due firmne&s;s, with their proper colour; and an unplea&s;ing
<PB N="12" REF="11">foulne&s;s grows upon the teeth: the in&s;ide of the mouth is pale and furred, and the throat dry and parched: the colour of the &s;kin is pale (though there are &s;ome periods when the face looks florid) and as the ob&s;truction gathers ground, and more affects the liver, the whole body becomes yellow, tawny, greeni&s;h, and at length of that deep and du&s;ky hue, to which men of &s;trong imagi|nation have given the name of blackne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms do not all appear in any one period of the di&s;ea&s;e; or all in any one ca&s;e; but at one time or other the whole of them; as well as others, which now fol|low: the fle&s;h becomes cold to the touch, though the patient does not him&s;elf perceive it; the limbs grow numbed and torpid, the breathing dull and &s;low, and the voice hollow; and u&s;ually the appetite in this pe|riod is reduced almo&s;t to nothing: night &s;weats come on, black &s;wellings appear on the veins, the fle&s;h wa&s;tes, and the brea&s;t becomes flat and hollow: the mouth is full of a thin &s;pittle, the head is always dizzy and confus'd; and &s;ometimes there is an un|conquerable numbne&s;s in the organs of &s;peech.</P>
<P>I have known the temporary &s;ilence that follows upon this la&s;t &s;ymptom become a je&s;t to the common herd; and the unhappy
<PB N="13" REF="12">patient, in&s;tead of compa&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, has received the reproof of &s;ullenne&s;s; from tho&s;e who &s;hould have known and acted better.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago I met, on a vi&s;it at Catthorpe in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, a young gen|tleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed learning and abili|ties, who, as I was told, at certain times was &s;peechle&s;s. The vulgar thought it a pretence: and a joco&s;e lady, where he was at tea with company, putting him as &s;he &s;aid to a trial, poured out a di&s;h very &s;trong, and without &s;ugar. He drank it; and re|turned the cup with a bow of great re&s;erve, and his eye bent on the ground: &s;he then filled the cup with &s;ugar, and pouring weak tea on it, &s;ent that al&s;o to him: he drank it; looked at her &s;teadily; and blu&s;hed for her. The lady declared the man was dumb in|deed; and the re&s;t thought him perver&s;e, and ob&s;tinate: but a con&s;tant and &s;teady per&s;eve|rance in an ea&s;y cour&s;e of medicines cured him.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are mi&s;eries which the di&s;ea&s;e, while it retains its natural form, can bring upon the patient; and thus he will in time be worn out; and led mi&s;erably, though &s;lowly, to the grave. Let him not indulge his inactivity &s;o far as to give way to this,
<PB N="14" REF="13">becau&s;e death is repre&s;ented as far off; for the di&s;ea&s;e may &s;uddenly and frightfully change its nature; and &s;wifter evils follow.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT IV. The DANGER.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH are the effects of this mi&s;chievous ob&s;truction, con&s;idered in its &s;imple &s;tate: but this, though often in it&s;elf un&s;urmountable by art; at lea&s;t by any method in common u&s;e; will be &s;ometimes broken through at once by nature, or by accidents; and bring on fatal evils. The&s;e are &s;trictly &s;peaking different di&s;ea&s;es; and are no otherway con|cerned here, than as the con&s;equences of that whereof we are treating.</P>
<P>The thick and glutinous blood, which has now &s;o long &s;tagnated in the &s;pleen, will have at length altered its nature; and ac|quired a very great degree of acrimony. While it remains dormant, this does no other mi&s;chiefs, than tho&s;e named already; but when violent exerci&s;e; a fit of outrageous anger; or any thing el&s;e that &s;uddenly
<PB N="15" REF="14">&s;hocks and di&s;turbs the frame, puts it in motion, it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction. Being now become thin, it mixes readily with the ma&s;s of blood again; and brings on putrid fevers; de&s;troys the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;pleen it&s;elf; or being thrown on &s;ome other of the vi&s;cera, corrodes them, and this way leads in a &s;wift and mi&s;erable death. If it fall upon the liver, that tender pulpy &s;ub&s;tance is &s;oon de&s;troyed; jaundices, beyond the help of art, fir&s;t follow; then drop&s;ies; and all their train of mi&s;ery: if it fix upon the lungs, con&s;umptions; if on the brain, convul|&s;ions, epilep&s;y, pal&s;y, and apoplexy; if on the &s;urface, lepro&s;y.</P>
<P>The true intention of cure in the Hypo|chondria&s;is, therefore, is to melt this coagu|lation &s;oftly; not to break it violently: and when thus di&s;&s;olved, to give it a very gentle pa&s;&s;age through the bowels. There is no &s;afe way for it to take but that; and even that, when hurried, may bring on fatal dy&s;enteries.</P>
<P>Let no one wonder at the &s;udden deva&s;|tation which &s;ometimes ri&s;es from this long &s;tagnant matter, when liquified too ha&s;tily: we know how long, how many years, the impacted matter will continue quiet in a
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;chirrous tumour of the brea&s;t; but being once put in motion, whether from acci|dent, or in the cour&s;e of nature, who can de&s;cribe; or what can &s;top its havock!</P>
<P>In&s;tances of the &s;ame nature, from this ob&s;tructing matter of the &s;pleen, are but too frequent. A nobleman the other day died paralytic; and di&s;&s;ection &s;hewed a &s;pleen con&s;umed by an ab&s;ce&s;s, formed by the di&s;&s;olved matter of &s;uch an ob&s;truction; and 'tis &s;carce longer &s;ince, that a learned gentleman, who had been &s;everal years lo&s;t to his friends, by the extreams of a Hy|pochondriacal di&s;order, &s;eem'd gradually without a&s;&s;i&s;tance to recover: but the lungs &s;uffered while the &s;pleen was freed; and he died very &s;oon of what is called a galloping con&s;umption.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, when the ob&s;truction is great and has been of long continuance, if it be thus ha&s;tily moved, the con&s;equence is, a &s;udden and a mi&s;erable death; whe|ther, like the matter of a cancer, it remains in its place, or, like that of a confluent &s;mall pox, be thrown upon &s;ome other vital part.</P>
<P>Yet let not the patient be too much alarmed: this is laid down to caution, not
<PB N="17" REF="16">to terrify. 'Tis fit that he &s;hould know his danger, and attend to it; for the pre|vention is ea&s;y: and the cure, even of the mo&s;t advanced &s;tages, when under|taken by gradual and gentle means, is not at all impracticable. To a&s;&s;i&s;t his phy&s;i|cian, let him look into him&s;elf; and recol|lect the &s;ource of his complaint: this he may judge of from the following no|tices.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V. The Cau&s;es of the HYPOCHONDRIASIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;truction which forms this di&s;ea&s;e, may take its origin from different accidents: a fever ill cured has often cau&s;ed it; or the piles, which had been u&s;ed to di&s;charge largely, cea&s;ing; a mar&s;hy &s;oil, poi&s;oned with &s;tagnant water, has given it to &s;ome per&s;ons; and altho' indolence and inactivity are oftene&s;t at the root, yet it has &s;ometimes ari&s;en from too great exerci&s;e.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<P>Real grief has often brought it on: and even love; for &s;ometimes that is real. Study and fixed attention of the mind have been accu&s;ed before; and add to the&s;e the &s;tooping po&s;ture of the body, which mo&s;t men u&s;e, though none &s;hould u&s;e it, in writing and in reading: this has contri|buted too much to it: but of all other things, night &s;tudies are the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive. The &s;teady &s;tillne&s;s, and du&s;ky ha|bit of all nature in tho&s;e hours, enforce, encourage, and &s;upport that &s;ettled gloom, which ri&s;es from fixt thought; and &s;inks the body to the grave; even while it car|ries up the mind to heaven. He who would have his lamp

<P>LET him who would e&s;cape the mi&s;|chiefs of an ob&s;tructed &s;pleen, avoid the things here named: and let him who &s;uffers from the malady, endeavour to re|member to which of them it has been owing: for half the hope of relief de|pends upon that knowledge.</P>
<P>Nature has &s;ometimes made a cure her|&s;elf, and we &s;hould watch her ways; for art never is &s;o right as when it imitates her: and &s;ometimes the patient's own re&s;o|lution has &s;et him free. This is always in his power; and at all times will do wonders.</P>
<P>The bleeding of the piles, from nature's &s;ingle efforts, has at once cured a mi&s;era|ble man; where their ce&s;&s;ation was the

This la&s;t among the Jews happened often: both di&s;ea&s;es we know were common to them: and I have here &s;een &s;omething very like it. Water-Dock has thrown out &s;corbutic eruptions, and all the former &s;ymptoms of an Hypochondriacal di&s;order have di&s;appeared: returning indeed when the&s;e were unadvi&s;edly &s;truck in; but keeping off entirely when they were more wi&s;ely treated.

If a na|tural loo&s;ene&s;s may perform the cure, &s;o may an artificial; when the original &s;ource of the di&s;order points that way.

<P>The general and univer&s;al method of cure mu&s;t be by &s;ome mild and gently re&s;olving medicine; under the influence of which the ob&s;tructing matter may be voided that, or &s;ome other way with &s;afety.

<P>In the fir&s;t place, no &s;trong evacuating remedy mu&s;t be given; for that, by car|rying off the thinner parts of the juices, will tend to thicken the remainder; and that way certainly encrea&s;e the di&s;temper.

<HEAD>SECT VI. Rules of Life for HYPOCHONDRIAC PERSONS.</HEAD>
<P>AIR and exerci&s;e, as they are the be&s;t pre&s;ervers of health, are al&s;o greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the cure of all long-continued di&s;ea&s;es, and they will have their full effect in this: but there requires &s;ome caution in the choice, and management of them. It is common to think the air of high grounds be&s;t; but experience near home &s;hews otherwi&s;e: the Hypochondriac patient is always wor&s;e at Highgate, even than in London.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<P>The air he breathes &s;hould be temperate; not expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t violences of heat or cold, and to the &s;wift changes from one to the other; which are mo&s;t felt on tho&s;e high grounds. The &s;ide of a hill is the be&s;t place for him: and though wet grounds are hurtful; yet let there be the &s;hade of trees, to tempt him often to a walk; and &s;often by their exhalations the over dryne&s;s of the air.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e he takes &s;hould be frequent; but not violent. Motion pre&s;erves the firmne&s;s of the parts, and ela&s;ticity of the ve&s;&s;els: and it prevents that aggregation of thick humours which he is mo&s;t to fear. A &s;edentary life always produces weakne&s;s, and that mi&s;chief follows: weak eyes are gummy, weak lungs are clogged with phlegm, and weak bowels wa&s;te them&s;elves in vapid diarrhoeas.</P>
<P>Let him invite him&s;elf abroad, and let his friends invite him by every innocent inducement. For me, I &s;hould advi&s;e above all other things the &s;tudy of Nature. Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual plea&s;ure, and continual change; fertile of a thou&s;and u&s;eful things: even of the utility we are &s;eeking here.
<PB N="24" REF="23">This will induce him to walk; and every hedge and hillock, every foot-path &s;ide, and thicket, will afford him &s;ome new ob|ject. He will be tempted to be continu|ally in the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the air, by vi&s;it|ing in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion the high lands and the low, the lawn, the heath, and fore&s;t. He will never want inducement to be abroad; and the uncea&s;ing variety in the &s;ubjects of his ob&s;ervation, will prevent his walking ha&s;tily: he will pur&s;ue his &s;tudies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in his clo&s;et threatened his de&s;truc|tion, will thus become the great means of his recovery.</P>
<P>If the mind tire upon this, from the re|peated u&s;e, another of nature's kingdoms opens it&s;elf at once upon him; the plant he is weary of ob&s;erving, feeds &s;ome in&s;ect he may examine; nor is there a &s;tone that lies before his foot, but may afford in&s;truc|tion and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Even what the vulgar call the mo&s;t ab|ject things will &s;hew a wonderful utility; and lead the mind, in pious contemplation higher than the &s;tars. The poore&s;t mo&s;s that is trampled under foot, has its im|portant
<PB N="25" REF="24">u&s;es: is it at the bottom of a wood we find it? why there it &s;helters the fallen &s;eeds; hides them from birds; and covers them from fro&s;t; and thus becomes the fo&s;ter-father of another fore&s;t! creeps it along the &s;urface of a rock? even there its good is infinite! its &s;mall roots run into the &s;tone; and the rains make their way after them; the mo&s;s having lived its time, dies: it rots, and with the mouldered fragments of the &s;tone forms earth; wherein, after a few &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, u&s;eful plants may grow, and feed more u&s;eful cattle!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biberg.</NOTE></P>
<P>Is there a weed more humble in its a&s;|pect, more trampled on, or more de&s;pi&s;ed than knot-gra&s;s? no art can get the better of its growth; no labour can de&s;troy it! 'twere pity if they could: for the thing lives where nothing would of u&s;e to us; and its large and mo&s;t wonderfully abun|dant &s;eeds, feed, in hard winters, half the birds of Heaven.</P>
<P>What the weak mo&s;s performs upon the rock, the loathed toad&s;tool brings about in timber: is an oak dead where man's
<PB N="26" REF="25">eye will not find it? this fungus roots it|&s;elf upon the bark; and rots the wood beneath it: hither the beetle creeps for &s;helter, and for &s;u&s;tenance; him the wood|pecker follows as his prey; and while he tears the tree in &s;earch of him, he &s;catters it about the ground; which it manures.</P>
<P>Nor is it the beetle alone that thus in&s;i|nuates it&s;elf into the &s;ub&s;tance of the ve|getable tribe: the tender aphide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reaumur.</NOTE>, whom a touch de&s;troys, burrows between the two &s;kins of a leaf, for &s;helter from his winged enemies; tracing, with more than Dedalaean art, his various meanders; and veining the green &s;urface with the&s;e white lines more beautifully than the be&s;t Aegyp|tian marble.</P>
<P>'Twere endle&s;s to proceed; nor is it needful: one object will not fail to lead on to another, and every where the good|ne&s;s of his God will &s;hine before him, even in what are thought the vile&s;t things; his greatne&s;s in the lea&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Let him pur&s;ue the&s;e thoughts, and &s;eek abroad the objects and the in&s;tigations to
<PB N="27" REF="26">them: but let him in the&s;e and all other excur&s;ions avoid equally the dews of early morning, and of evening.</P>
<P>The more than u&s;ual exerci&s;e of this pre&s;cription will di&s;po&s;e him to more than cu&s;tomary &s;leep, let him indulge it freely; &s;o far from hurting, it will help his cure.</P>
<P>Let him avoid all exce&s;&s;es: drink need &s;carce be named; for we are writing to men of better and of nobler minds, than can be tempted to that humiliating vice: Tho&s;e who in this di&s;order have too great an appetite, mu&s;t not indulge it: much eaten was never well dige&s;ted: but of all exce&s;&s;es, the mo&s;t fatal in this ca&s;e is that of venery. It is the exce&s;s we &s;peak of.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. The proper DIET.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place acids mu&s;t be avoided carefully; and all things that are in a &s;tate of fermentation; for they will breed acidity. Provi&s;ions hardened by &s;alting never &s;hould be ta&s;ted; much le&s;s tho&s;e cured by &s;moaking, and by &s;alting. Bacon is indige&s;tible in an Hypochondriac &s;to|mach; and hams, impregnated as is now the cu&s;tom, with acid fumes from the wood fires over which they are hung, have that additional mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Milk ought to be a great article in the diet: and even in this there &s;hould be choice. The milk of gra&s;s-fed cows has its true quality: and no other. There are a multitude of ways in which this may be
<PB N="29" REF="28">made a part both of our foods and drinks, and they &s;hould all be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The great and general caution is, that the diet be at all times of a kind loo&s;en|ing, and gently &s;timulating; light, but not acrid. Veal, lamb, fowls, lob&s;ters, crabs, craw-fi&s;h, fre&s;h-water fi&s;h, and mutton broth, with plenty of boiled vegetables, are always right; and give enough va|riety.</P>
<P>Raw vegetables are all bad: &s;our wines, old chee&s;e, and bottled beer, are things ne|ver to be once ta&s;ted. Indeed much wine is wrong, be it of what kind &s;oever. It is the fir&s;t of cordials; and as &s;uch only I would have it taken in this di&s;ea&s;e; when it is wanted: plainly as a medicine, rather than a part of diet. Malt-liquor carefully cho&s;en, is certainly the be&s;t drink. This mu&s;t be neither new, nor tending to &s;our|ne&s;s; perfectly clear, and of a moderate &s;trength: it is the native liquor of our country; and the mo&s;t healthful.</P>
<P>Too much tea weakens; and even &s;ugar is in this di&s;order hurtful: but honey may &s;upply its place in mo&s;t things; and this is not only harmle&s;s, but medicinal; a very
<PB N="30" REF="29">powerful di&s;&s;olvent of impacted humours; and a great deob&s;truent.</P>
<P>What wine is drank &s;hould be of &s;ome of the &s;weet kinds. Old Hock has been found, upon enquiry, to yield more than ten times the acid of the &s;weet wines; and in red Port, at lea&s;t in what we are content to call &s;o, there is an a&s;tringent quality, that is mo&s;t mi&s;chievous in the&s;e ca&s;es: it is &s;aid there is often alum in it: how pregnant with evil that mu&s;t be, to per&s;ons who&s;e bowels require to be kept open, is mo&s;t evident. Summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmle&s;s, but medicinal; but if eaten unripe, they will be prejudicial. A light &s;upper, which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfa&s;t, is always right; and this will not let the &s;tomach be ravenous for dinner; as it is apt to be in tho&s;e who make that their only meal.</P>
<P>One caution more mu&s;t be given; and it may &s;eem a &s;trange one: it is, that the pa|tient attend regularly to his hours of eat|ing. We have to do with men for the mo&s;t part, who&s;e &s;oul is the great object of their regard; but let them not forget they have a body.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<P>The late Dr. STUKELY has told me, that one day by appointment vi&s;iting Sir ISAAC NEWTON, the &s;ervant told him, he was in his &s;tudy. No one was permitted to di&s;turb him there; but as it was near his dinner-time, the vi&s;itor &s;at down to wait for him. After a time, dinner was brought in; a boil'd chicken under a cover. An hour pa&s;s'd, and Sir ISAAC did not appear. The doctor then eat the fowl; and covering up the empty di&s;h, bad them dre&s;s their ma&s;ter another. Before that was ready, the great man came down: he apologiz'd for his delay; and added, <Q>"Give me but leave to take my &s;hort dinner, and I &s;hall be at your &s;ervice; I am fatigued and faint."</Q> Saying this, he lifted up the cover; and without any emotion, turned about to STUKELY with a &s;mile; <Q>"See,"</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>"what we &s;tudious people are, I forgot I had din'd."</Q></P>

<P>'TIS the ill fate of this di&s;ea&s;e, more than of all others, to be mi&s;under|&s;tood at fir&s;t; and thence neglected, till the phy&s;ician &s;hakes his head at a few fir&s;t que&s;tions. None &s;teals &s;o fatally upon the &s;ufferer: its advances are by very &s;low de|grees; but every day it grows more diffi|cult of cure.</P>
<P>That an ob&s;truction in the &s;pleen is the true malady, the ca&s;es related by the an|tients, pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation, and the unerring te&s;timonies of diffections, leave no room to doubt. Being under&s;tood, the path is open where to &s;eek a remedy: and our be&s;t guides in this, as in the former in&s;tance, will be tho&s;e venerable Greeks; who &s;aw a thou&s;and of the&s;e ca&s;es, where we meet with one; and with le&s;s than half our theory, cured twice as many patients.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="32">
<P>One e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine holds place in all the&s;e writers; that whatever by a ha&s;ty fermentation di&s;&s;olves the impacted matter of the ob&s;truction, and &s;ends it in that &s;tate into the blood, does incredible mi&s;chief; but that whatever medicine &s;oftens it by &s;low degrees; and, as it melts, delivers it to the bowels without di&s;turbance; will cure with equal certainty, and &s;afety.</P>
<P>For this good purpo&s;e, they knew and tried a multitude of herbs: but in the end they fixed on one: and on their repeated trials of this, they bani&s;hed all the re&s;t. This &s;tood alone for the cure of the di&s;|ea&s;e; and from its virtue received the name of SPLEEN-WORT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. O wi&s;e and happy Greeks! authors of knowledge and perpe|tuators of it! With them the very name they gave a plant declared its virtues: but with us, a writer calls an herb from &s;ome friend; that the good gardener who receives the honour, may call another by his name who gave it. We now add the term <HI>&s;mooth</HI> to the name of this herb, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another, called by the &s;ame general term, though not much re&s;embling it.</P>
<P>The virtues of this &s;mooth Spleen-wort
<PB N="34" REF="33">have &s;tood the te&s;t of ages; and the plant has every where retained its name and credit. One of our good old herbari&s;ts, who had &s;een a wonderful ca&s;e of a &s;woln &s;pleen, &s;o big, and hard, as to be felt with terror, brought back to a &s;tate of nature by it; and all the mi&s;erable &s;ymptoms vani&s;h with the &s;welling; thought Spleen-wort not enough expre&s;&s;ive of its excellence; but &s;tampt on it the name of MILT-WASTE.</P>
<P>In the Greek I&s;lands now, the u&s;e of it is known to every one: and even the lazy monks who take it, are no longer &s;plenetic. In the we&s;t of England, the rocks are &s;trip|ped of it with diligence; and every old woman tells you how charming that leaf is for booki&s;h men: in Ru&s;&s;ia they u&s;e a plant of this kind in their malt liquor: it came into fa&s;hion there for the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e; which, from its con&s;tant u&s;e, is &s;carce known any longer; and they now &s;uppo&s;e 'tis added to their liquor for a flavour.</P>
<P>The antients held it in a kind of venera|ration; and u&s;ed what has been called a &s;uper&s;tition in the gathering it. It was to be taken up with a &s;harp knife, without vi|olence, and laid upon clean linen. No time but the &s;till darkne&s;s of the night was pro|per,
<PB N="35" REF="34">and even the moon was not to &s;hine upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Silente Luna.</NOTE>. I know they have been ridiculed for this; for nothing is &s;o vain as learned ignorance: but let me be permitted once to vindicate them.</P>
<P>The plant has leaves which can clo&s;e at their &s;ides; and their under part is covered thick with a yellow powder; con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;eeds, and &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els: in the&s;e they knew the virtue mo&s;t re&s;ided: this was the golden du&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pulvis Aureus.</NOTE> they held &s;o valuable; and this they knew they could not be too cau|tious to pre&s;erve. They were not igno|rant of the &s;leep of plants; a matter lately &s;poken of by &s;ome, as if a new di&s;covery; and being &s;en&s;ible that light, a dry air, an expanded leaf, and a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on, were the means of lo&s;ing this fine du&s;t; and knowing al&s;o that darkne&s;s alone brought on that clo&s;ing of the leaf which thence has been called &s;leep; and which helped to de|fend and to &s;ecure it; they therefore took &s;uch time, and u&s;ed &s;uch means, as could be&s;t pre&s;erve the plant entire; and even &s;ave what might be &s;cattered from it.&mdash;And now where is their &s;uper&s;tition?</P>
<P>From this plant thus collected they pre|pared
<PB N="36" REF="35">a medicine, which, in a cour&s;e of forty days, &s;carce ever failed to make a perfect cure.</P>
<P>We have the plant wild with us; and till the fa&s;hion of rough chemical preparations took off our attention from the&s;e gentler re|medies, it was in frequent u&s;e; and great repute. I tru&s;t it will be &s;o again: and many thank me for re&s;toring it to notice.</P>
<P>Spleen-wort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture; and a &s;mall do&s;e of this, mixing readily with the blood and juices, gradually di&s;&s;olves the ob&s;truction; and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be thrown off without pain, from the bowels. Let this be done while the vi&s;cera are yet &s;ound and the cure is perfect. More than the forty days of the Greek method is &s;carce ever required; much oftener two thirds of that time &s;uffice: and every day, from the fir&s;t do&s;e of it, the patient feels the happy change that is growing in his con&s;titu|tion. His food no more turns putrid on his &s;tomach; but yields its healthful nouri&s;h|ment: the &s;welling after meals therefore vani&s;hes; and with that goes the lowne&s;s, and anxiety; the difficult breath, and the di&s;|tracting cholick: he can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain; he finds
<PB N="37" REF="36">him&s;elf more apt for motion, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> take that exerci&s;e which is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in his cure: life &s;eems no longer burthen-&s;ome: his bowels get into the natural condition of health, and perform their office once at lea&s;t a day; better if a little more: the dull and dead colour of his &s;kin goes off, his lips grow red again, and every &s;ign of health returns.</P>
<P>Let him who takes the medicine, &s;ay whether any thing here be exaggerated. Let him, if he plea&s;es to give him&s;elf the trouble, talk over with me, or write to me, this gradual decrea&s;e of his complaints, as he proceeds in his cure. My uncertain &s;tate of health does not permit me to practi&s;e phy&s;ic in the u&s;ual way; but I am very de&s;irous to do what good I can; and &s;hall never refu&s;e my advice, &s;uch as it may be, to any per&s;on, rich or poor, in whatever manner he may apply for it. I &s;hall refer him to no apothecary, who&s;e bills require he &s;hould be drenched with potions; but tell him, in this as in all other ca&s;es, where to find &s;ome &s;imple herb; which he may if he plea&s;e prepare him&s;elf; or if he had rather &s;pare that trouble, may have it &s;o prepared from tho&s;e whom I in&s;truct to do it.</P>
