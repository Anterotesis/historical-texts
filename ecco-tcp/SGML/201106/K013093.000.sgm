<P>THE following account of Factitious Airs, has been drawn up in the hopes of render|ing the pneumatic method of treating di&s;ea&s;es more generally under&s;tood than it hitherto appears to have been. The author has endeavoured to bring together under one point of view, the prin|cipal facts and di&s;coveries relating to the &s;ubject. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance he is little more than a mere expo&s;itor; but on a future occa&s;ion he hopes to add to the &s;tock of ob&s;ervations furni&s;hed by others, &s;omething of his own.</P>
<P>That the medicinal application of a&euml;riform fluids &s;hould meet with much oppo&s;ition, he is not &s;urpri&s;ed. Di&s;&s;atisfied with the theory of the hyperoxygenation of the blood in phthi&s;is pul|monalis, he will frankly own that he was for a long time inclined to view the new propo&s;al for curing di&s;ea&s;es by modified air, as a vi&s;ionary thing; but on recon&s;idering the &s;ubject, ab&s;tracted
<PB N="iv" REF="3">from theory (and this is the way in which it &s;hould be con&s;idered) he &s;aw analogy on its &s;ide; and after he had be&s;towed further attention upon it, he &s;aw it was &s;upported by facts. He could therefore no longer re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>If, as there is little doubt, &s;ub&s;tances are more operative upon the living body, in propor|tion as they are of a finer and more &s;ubtile na|ture, certainly medicines in an a&euml;rial form ought to have more effect than tho&s;e which are admi|ni&s;tered in a &s;olid or liquid &s;tate: And, if the vapour of water and other <HI>conden&s;able fluids,</HI> have been inhaled with advantage in certain af|fections of the lungs, analogy points out that the like advantages, or even greater, &s;hould be pro|duced by the inhalation of <HI>inconden&s;able fluids.</HI> This analogical induction has been confirmed by experiments, the re&s;ults of which are &s;tated in the following pages.</P>

<PB REF="4">
<P>IN order to give a ju&s;t notion of Pneumatic Medicine, it is nece&s;&s;ary to mention what takes place in the proce&s;s of breathing in the com|mon air. The che&s;t, in which the &s;oft and &s;pongy organs, called the lungs, are placed, is capable of having its capacity altered by the action of the mu&s;cles which belong to the ribs, by the action of the diaphragm, and by other co-operating cau&s;es. When, in con&s;equence of the elevation of the ribs, and de&s;cent of the diaphragm, its capacity is en|larged, the lungs are at liberty to expand, and be|come filled with air; i. e. we in&s;pire. On the other hand, by the depre&s;&s;ion of the ribs, by the a&s;cent of the diaphragm, and by the contraction of the mu&s;cles of the belly, the capacity of the che&s;t is dimini&s;hed, the lungs are compre&s;&s;ed, and the air that was ju&s;t before drawn in, is now forced out again; i. e. we expire. It is this alternate dilata|tion and compre&s;&s;ion of the lungs that is termed <HI>re&s;piration;</HI> a proce&s;s which is continually going on in the living body, and which cannot be &s;u&s;|pended (except in animals of a particular con&s;truc|tion) for much length of time without fatal con|&s;equences.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<P>Why re&s;piration is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the life of man, and mo&s;t other animals, is a que&s;tion which for ages has engaged the attention of phy&s;iologi&s;ts and phy&s;icians; but it was not till of late years properly explained. It was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the air which we breathe &s;erved no other pur|po&s;es than to expand the lungs, and thereby allow a free circulation through them, to cool the blood, and carry off moi&s;ture. But this account of the matter is now found to be not only imperfect, but in &s;ome degree erroneous. It is true that, without a due dilatation of the lungs, the blood cannot cir|culate freely and completely through them; but that this is not the principal u&s;e of breathing is evident from this circum&s;tance, that foul air, though it is equally capable with good air of filling and expanding the lungs, is neverthele&s;s not capable of &s;upporting life. It is al&s;o true, that a great quan|tity of moi&s;ture, &s;imilar to the per&s;pirable matter from the &s;kin, is di&s;charged from the lungs: but it is not &s;o clear that the blood is cooled by the atmo&s;pheric air that we in&s;pire: on the contrary, it appears to receive a &s;upply of heat from it.</P>
<P>When it was con&s;idered that air which has been frequently breathed becomes unfit for further re|&s;piration, it was natural to conclude, that, during
<PB N="3" REF="6">its application to the lungs, it mu&s;t have been de|prived of &s;ome principle nece&s;&s;ary to life. It has been proved within the&s;e few years by very deci|&s;ive experiments that this is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The atmo&s;phere which we breathe has been found to con&s;i&s;t of two kinds of air. That part of it which is con&s;umed by the act of re&s;piration (and by &s;ome other proce&s;&s;es) is called <HI>Dephlogi&s;ticated Air, Vital Air,</HI> or <HI>Oxygene Air.</HI> During its application to the lungs, this air, or &s;ome part of it, is ab&s;orbed by the blood, to which it imparts a florid colour, and a quantity of heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not all the oxygene air that di&s;appears, after an animal has repeatedly re&s;pired a given quantity of atmo&s;pheric air, is ab&s;orbed by the blood. Much, and perhaps the greate&s;t part of it, is u&s;ed in the formation of fixed or carbonic acid air, which is produced in great plenty by the proce&s;s of breathing. This air &s;eems to be formed in the lungs by the union of the coaly matter of the blood with the ba&s;is of the oxygene air. Hence, in re&s;piration, not only is &s;omething added to the blood, but &s;omething al&s;o (be&s;ides the per|&s;pirable vapour before-mentioned) is taken from it.</NOTE>. Animals live much longer in a &s;mall quantity of this than of any other air. When breathed in a larger proportion than that in which it naturally occurs in the atmo&s;phere, it rai&s;es the &s;pirits, promotes the circulation, increa&s;es the heat of the body, and heightens the colour of the blood. If it be breathed alone by healthy animals, in large quantities, and for any length of time, its
<PB N="4" REF="7">&s;timulant effects are carried to exce&s;s, and febrile and inflammatory &s;ymptoms en&s;ue. This air is further di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other kinds of ela&s;tic fluids, by its property of promoting combu&s;tion, and increa&s;|ing the vehemence and vividne&s;s of flame. It may be procured from various &s;ub&s;tances; but for me|dical u&s;e, it is be&s;t obtained by &s;ubjecting the mineral called mangane&s;e to a red heat. At the fir&s;t time of u&s;ing it, this air &s;hould be mixed with eight or ten times its bulk of atmo&s;pheric air.</P>
<P>The other kind of air which enters into the compo&s;ition of the atmo&s;phere, and which con|&s;titutes by far the greate&s;t part of it (amounting to nearly three-fourths of the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to late experiments, 100 parts of atmo&s;pheric air con&s;i&s;t of <HI>about</HI> 28 oxygene, and 72 azote. I &s;ay about; for it is never (at lea&s;t to a certain height from the &s;urface of the earth) free from a &s;mall quantity of fixed or carbonic acid air; and in the neighbourhood of mar&s;hes, moats, &s;inks, &amp;c. in &s;hort, wherever animal &s;ub&s;tances, or mixtures of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, are putrefying in &s;tagnant water, the atmo&s;phere contains &s;ome in|flammable air. But the&s;e are to be con&s;idered as accidental admix|tures.
<P>From all the experiments that have hitherto been made upon the &s;ubject, the con&s;tituent parts of the atmo&s;phere appear to be mixed together in the proportions above-mentioned. But it is to be wi&s;hed, that the&s;e experiments were more exten&s;ively repeated in different latitudes, and in different places of the &s;ame latitude, by &s;ea and by land, among mountains and in plains, in open &s;itua|tions, and in countries covered with woods. We know not yet what variations, in this re&s;pect, may be produced by difference of climate, difference of elevation above the &s;ea, proximity to, or re|motene&s;s from the &s;ea, expo&s;ure to particular winds, &amp;c. Amid &s;uch a variety of local differences, it is to be &s;u&s;pected (as a gentle|man well ver&s;ed in chemi&s;try hinted to me) that the a&s;&s;igned pro|portions are not in every place, and at all times, the &s;ame.</P></NOTE>) is called <HI>Phlo|gi&s;ticated Air,</HI> or <HI>Azote.</HI> If this air is applied to
<PB N="5" REF="8">the animal body with a le&s;s proportion of oxygene than that which is naturally mixed with it in the atmo&s;phere, it lowers the &s;pirits, weakens the cir|culation, and darkens the blood: and if it be en|tirely deprived of oxygene, it becomes unfit for the &s;upport of life and flame. This air is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the other unre&s;pirable airs, which are afterwards mentioned, by not being ab&s;orbed by water, by not precipitating lime from lime-water, and by not being inflammable. Be&s;ides its u&s;e as a diluent of the oxygene, it may &s;erve &s;ome other purpo&s;e with which we are yet unacquainted.</P>
<P>This air may be ea&s;ily deprived of its natural admixture of oxygene, by burning a candle, or any other combu&s;tible body, in a quantity of it properly inclo&s;ed. If the remaining air be afterwards &s;haken together with a &s;ufficient quantity of lime-water, the fixed air produced by the burning candle will be &s;eparated from it, and pure azote will be ob|tained; or it may be procured in large quantities, by agitating with lime-water the mixture of fixed
<PB N="6" REF="9">and azotic air, obtained, according to Mr. Watt's method, by pa&s;&s;ing common air through burning charcoal. The fixed air will be &s;eparated and ab|&s;orbed by the lime-water, and the azotic air will be left unmixed.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t time of u&s;ing it, this air &s;hould be mixed with four or five times its quantity of at|mo&s;pheric air. The proportion may afterwards be increa&s;ed according to its effects.</P>
<P>Now, as neither of the&s;e airs could for any length of time be &s;afely breathed alone, Providence has made the atmo&s;phere to con&s;i&s;t of both, mixed together in &s;uch proportions as doubtle&s;s are mo&s;t fit for the &s;upport of animal and vegetable life in general. But although the&s;e proportions are be&s;t adapted to the maintenance of animated beings in a healthy &s;tate, yet there is rea&s;on to think, they are not &s;o well &s;uited to every di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the living frame. Thus, in certain ca&s;es, where the circulation is languid, the heat deficient, and the powers of motion and &s;en&s;ation nearly exhau&s;ted, a greater quantity of oxygene, i. e. a greater quantity of vital &s;timulus than the common air affords, &s;hould be of u&s;e: on the other hand, in an oppo&s;ite &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, le&s;&s;ening the quantity of oxygene by applying a greater proportion of azote, in other
<PB N="7" REF="10">words, withdrawing a part of the atmo&s;pheric &s;timulus, ought to give relief.</P>
<P>On this is founded one part of the pneumatic medicine; and the trials that have already been made of it, have been attended with &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s, that there is every rea&s;on to expect, that, by means of it, phy&s;icians may now be enabled to afford great relief, if not to effect a cure, in many di&s;ea&s;es which have hitherto re&s;i&s;ted the u&s;ual modes of treatment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the airs above-mentioned, of which the atmo&s;phere is compo&s;ed, there are various other kinds of airs, or permanently ela&s;tic fluids; and as they have active properties different from tho&s;e which the con&s;tituent parts of the atmo&s;phere po&s;|&s;e&s;s, it was thought that they, too, might be ad|vantageou&s;ly applied in certain deviations from health. Experience has proved this rea&s;oning to be ju&s;t. They have been applied with great &s;ucce&s;s in &s;everal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>As in certain e&s;&s;ential properties, &s;uch as levity, tenuity, tran&s;parency, compre&s;&s;ibility, expan&s;ibility, and <HI>permanent ela&s;ticity,</HI> the&s;e fluids agree with the common atmo&s;pherical fluid (though they differ from it very materially in other re&s;pects, and par|ticularly
<PB N="8" REF="11">in the circum&s;tance of being alone unfit for the &s;upport of life) they go under the general name of <HI>Airs</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They are al&s;o called <HI>Ga&s;es.</HI></NOTE>, and though &s;ome of them are pro|duced by the operations of nature, yet as they may at any time be obtained by artificial proce&s;&s;es, they are called <HI>Factitious Airs.</HI> The names and proper|ties of &s;uch as are u&s;ed in medicine, are now to be mentioned.</P>
<P>They may be referred to two heads, the <HI>Inflam|mable</HI> and <HI>Uninflammable.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>inflammable air,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Hydrogene,</HI> is meant that kind of permanently ela&s;tic fluid, which, though incapable by it&s;elf of &s;upporting flame, does, when mixed or brought into contact with atmo&s;pheric or oxygene air, take fire on the approach of an ignited body, or on the application of the electrical &s;park. Alone, though it produces no irritating effects, it is unfit for re&s;piration. Its other di&s;tingui&s;hing properties are, that it is not ab&s;orbed by water, and that it is by far the lighte&s;t of all known fluids.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;pecies or varieties of this kind of air, differing in their &s;pecific properties ac|cording to the different nature of the &s;ub&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="12">from which they are produced. For our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, it will be &s;ufficient to mention three dif|ferent &s;orts, viz. inflammable air from heated iron and water, or <HI>martial hydrogene;</HI> inflammable air from melted zinc and water, or <HI>zincic hydrogene;</HI> and, la&s;tly, inflammable air from red hot charcoal and water, or <HI>carbonated hydrogene,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>hydro carbonate.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;pecies or varieties of inflammable air, when breathed along with atmo&s;pheric air, have one common operation upon the human body, though &s;ome of them produce their effects more &s;uddenly, and in a more powerful degree than the re&s;t. All of them dimini&s;h the heat and lower the pul&s;e. Hence they have a cooling and &s;edative effect; and in this way are &s;erviceable in &s;ome kinds of con&s;umption and other inflammatory affections of the lungs.</P>
<P>The martial and zincic inflammable airs may, e&s;pecially if they are &s;et by a few hours before they are u&s;ed, be admini&s;tered pretty freely, viz. in the proportion of one part to five or &s;ix parts of at|mo&s;pheric air; but the do&s;es of inflammable air from charcoal, &s;hould be con&s;iderably &s;maller, viz. it &s;hould at fir&s;t be mixed with as much as fif|teen or twenty times its bulk of common air. For further remarks on the proportions in which the&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="13">airs &s;hould be diluted before they are applied to the lungs, the medical reader is referred to the publica|tion quoted at the end of this pamphlet.</P>
<P>Under the head of uninflammable air, it is only nece&s;&s;ary on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to take notice of <HI>Fixed</HI> or <HI>Carbonic Acid Air.</HI> Like azotic and in|flammable air, it extingui&s;hes flame; but, unlike to them, it is ab&s;orbed by water, to which it com|municates acid properties, and it precipitates lime from lime water. It is heavier than any of the other ela&s;tic fluids of which we have been treating. This air is produced in the proce&s;s of re&s;piration, as we have before mentioned. It is thrown out by wort and the juices of vegetables, while they are undergoing fermentation. It is al&s;o let loo&s;e when vinegar or oil of vitriol is poured upon lime-&s;tone, marble, or chalk; but for medicinal u&s;e, it is be&s;t procured from chalk by heat alone. Applied to the lungs, fixed or carbonic acid air produces effects &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e produced by the inflam|mable airs: It is cooling; but, when properly diluted, by no means &s;o depre&s;&s;ing or &s;edative as they are; and it further differs from them in its property of checking putrefaction, and correcting the foetor of mucous and purulent matter. Hence it has proved &s;erviceable in ulcerations and ab&s;ce&s;&s;es of the lungs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Percival's E&s;&s;ays, Vol. 1, p. 308, and Withering on Fox|glove, p. 205.</NOTE>.
<PB N="11" REF="14">Applied to cancerous &s;ores on the &s;urface of the body, it quickly removes or abates the pain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As fixed air is &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly efficacious in abating the pain of cancerous ulcers and of bli&s;tered parts, might it not prove a valuable external remedy in burns and &s;calds, the pain and irrita|tion from which are &s;eldom much allayed by the applications commonly u&s;ed. Hence, when the excoriation is of con&s;iderable extent, violent fever, delirium, &amp;c. &s;upervene; and in young &s;ubjects, convul&s;ions and death: All which might po&s;&s;ibly, in many ca&s;es, be prevented by a &s;peedy removal of the pain.</NOTE>, and gradually improves the di&s;charge; and in one in|&s;tance it has cau&s;ed a remarkably large ulcer of this kind to heal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of two Ca&s;es of Cancer, &amp;c. by Dr. Ewart. The cure of ulcerated cancer of the mamma, in the in&s;tance of Su&s;an Alford, of the Bath Infirmary, would have been very deci&s;ive in favour of fixed air, if ar&s;enic had not been pre&s;cribed at the &s;ame time. But it may be a&s;ked, whether it is probable that &s;uch an active &s;ub&s;tance, given in the do&s;e of the <HI>16th part of a grain, three times a day for nine or ten weeks,</HI> &s;hould produce no &s;ort of effect? If it produced any, it mu&s;t have been a good effect, as the amendment was progre&s;&s;ive during its u&s;e. The abatement of pain and irritation, the im|proved &s;mell, and improved appearance of the di&s;charge, were evidently owing to the topical application; but as there was not &s;uch a rapid amendment in another patient, in which ar&s;enic was not given, it may be que&s;tioned whether this mineral had not &s;ome &s;hare in the cure of the fir&s;t.
<P>Whatever might be the operation of the ar&s;enic in Alford's ca&s;e, the good effects of carbonic acid air applied to cancerous ulcers in Dr. Ewart's way are &s;o con&s;picuous, that every per&s;on who has the misfortune to be afflicted with &s;ores of that nature mu&s;t be eager to have it tried.</P>
<P>If Mr. Ju&s;tamond did not &s;ucceed &s;o well with the &s;ame remedy in &s;uch ca&s;es, it was probably owing to &s;ome imperfection in the mode of applying it. Had the atmo&s;pheric air been entirely ex|cluded, and the fixed air con&s;tantly applied, the event of his trials might have been different. Whoever wi&s;hes for further informa|tion on the internal and external u&s;e of this &s;pecies of ela&s;tic fluid, &s;hould con&s;ult <HI>Dob&s;on's Commentary on Fixed Air.</HI></P></NOTE>. When applied to the lungs, this air &s;hould be diluted with ten or twelve times its
<PB N="12" REF="15">bulk of atmo&s;pherical air; but when applied to external &s;ores, it &s;hould be u&s;ed unmixed.</P>
<P>If to the&s;e airs, of which we have ju&s;t given an account, we add the two kinds before de&s;cribed, which enter into the compo&s;ition of the atmo&s;|phere, we &s;hall have &s;ix &s;orts of air for medicinal u&s;e, viz. oxygene and azote, three &s;pecies of in|flammable air, and fixed or carbonic acid air. The&s;e are by no means all the different kinds of airs that may be obtained, nor perhaps all that may be found u&s;eful in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es; but they are as many as have yet been tried with this intention, and therefore as many as it is nece&s;&s;ary to notice on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid, it appears that there is in fact but one kind of air, viz. oxygene, that is capable of &s;upporting of life; but, that being of a highly &s;timulant nature, it is largely di|luted in the atmo&s;phere with another kind of air
<PB N="13" REF="16">(azote) of directly oppo&s;ite qualities: That the na|tural mixture of the&s;e airs, though be&s;t accom|modated to the healthy &s;tate of animal life in ge|neral, does not appear to be be&s;t &s;uited to every morbid &s;tate of the living body; and, therefore, that by varying their proportions, &s;uch mixtures may be obtained as are capable of mitigating or curing many formidable di&s;ea&s;es: That, moreover, there are various other kinds of airs, be&s;ides tho&s;e which enter into the compo&s;ition of the atmo&s;phere, which po&s;&s;e&s;s peculiar and active virtues, and which, under proper management, may al&s;o be applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, then, it appears that the pneumatic me|dicine comprehends not merely the application of more or le&s;s oxygene, more or le&s;s azote; but the application al&s;o of various other kinds of airs, mixed and diluted in proper proportions.</P>
<P>How much may be done by applying ela&s;tic fluids directly to the lungs, it is ea&s;y to conceive after what has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject of re&s;pira|tion. Part of the air thus applied, is, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, taken into the blood, and quickly con|veyed to every part of the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In explaining the manner in which factitious airs produce their medicinal effects, we are far from attributing &s;o much to ab|&s;orption as others might do. It appears to us, that the &s;ubject has been treated by an author of great abilities &s;omewhat too chemically. Before we place the origin of di&s;ea&s;es in chemical changes of the blood, we &s;hould prove that the&s;e changes are antecedent, and not con&s;equent to the altered action of the &s;olids. But this, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, will be no ea&s;y matter. In the mean time it is well for pneumatic medicine, that it is not to &s;tand or fall according to the validity or invalidity of any hypothe&s;is, but is to re&s;t on the ba&s;is of fact and experience.</NOTE>.

<P>In which &s;oever of the&s;e ways their effects are produced, certain it is that great benefit has been derived from &s;ome of them in di&s;orders of the lungs, and other complaints. In con&s;umptions, in particular, the inflammable airs have afforded &s;ur|pri&s;ing relief; and it is &s;aid that in &s;ome paralytic and nervous affections, good effects have been pro|duced
<PB N="15" REF="18">by means of oxygene air. This air has al&s;o been employed with great &s;ucce&s;s in ca&s;es of &s;uf|focation from drowning, or other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not attempt to enumerate all the di&s;|ea&s;es in which pneumatic medicine promi&s;es to be of u&s;e. It will be &s;ufficient to &s;tate in a general way, that tho&s;e are proper ca&s;es for the application of factitious airs, which re&s;i&s;t, or do not readily give way to the common modes of treatment: &s;uch are con&s;umption, a&s;thma, &s;crophula, pal&s;y, &amp;c. It &s;hould be under&s;tood, that the application of mixed airs to the lungs, is not to prevent medicines from being taken into the &s;tomach in the ordinary way; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which &s;peedy and effectual relief is procured by the remedies already in u&s;e, the pneumatic method is of cour&s;e &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>Under proper management, the application of modified airs to the lungs is perfectly &s;afe and ea&s;y. The mixed airs are breathed out of bags; and no trouble or exertion is required on the part of the patient. That &s;ome of them po&s;&s;e&s;s very powerful and active properties, is no objection to their u&s;e; for the &s;ame may be &s;aid of opium, and certain preparations of antimony and mercury, which are daily pre&s;cribed, and which only do mi&s;chief in the hands of unqualified per&s;ons. The&s;e airs, like all
<PB N="16" REF="19">other medicines, may be overdo&s;ed; but prac|titioners, who are acquainted with their effects, will take care that they are not too freely or too fre|quently applied. With &s;uch precautions they may be pronounced to be as &s;afe as mo&s;t other medi|cines.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;s which has already attended the medicinal application of factitious airs at Bri&s;tol and other places, a propo&s;al has been made for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a public Pneumatic In&s;titution in London, for which &s;ub&s;criptions are now opened in this and &s;everal other towns. Ap|paratu&s;es for obtaining the different kinds of airs, have been introduced into the Ho&s;pital and Di&s;|pen&s;ary here; and in proce&s;s of time, when the preparation and u&s;es of the&s;e ela&s;tic fluids come to be generally under&s;tood, we may expect that the&s;e apparatu&s;es will be found in the laboratories of mo&s;t of the apothecaries. Phy&s;icians will then have opportunities of pre&s;cribing the pneumatic treat|ment in all ca&s;es in which they may judge it to be proper.</P>

<HEAD>Mi&s;cellaneous Ob&s;ervations ON <HI>Some</HI> REMEDIES <HI>u&s;ed in</HI> CONSUMPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>CONSUMPTIONS are very rare in the We&s;t-Indies; but the Negroes employed in the plantations, are not wholly exempt from them. When they happen to be attacked with &s;uch com|plaints, it is a practice in &s;ome of the i&s;lands to &s;end them to the &s;ugar-hou&s;es, the air and vapour of which are, according to the te&s;timony of a
<PB N="18" REF="21">French author, Raullin, a remedy in &s;uch ca&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Finke medicini&s;che Geographie, <HI>1</HI> band. <HI>464.</HI></NOTE>. In the &s;pace of two months the con&s;umptive ne|groes are (we are told) generally greatly relieved, or quite cured, by this method. Doubtle&s;s the air of the boiling-hou&s;es is an atmo&s;phere of a lowered &s;tandard, containing much fixed air, be&s;ides &s;ome oily matter, extricated from the juice of the cane, during the boiling. And the air of the &s;till-hou&s;es mu&s;t be &s;trongly impregnated with carbonic acid, thrown out from the open ci&s;terns in which the mela&s;&s;es, &s;cummings, and lees, are &s;et to ferment.</P>
<P>THE relief which &s;ome con&s;umptive per&s;ons are &s;aid to have received from breathing the air of cow-hou&s;es, is too much connected with the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject to be pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. The anti|phthi&s;ical effects of this remedy, &s;eem to be ow|ing, as Dr. Beddoes has &s;ugge&s;ted, to the &s;ubtrac|tion of oxygene; and I would add, in &s;ome degree al&s;o to the fixed air largely produced by the re&s;pira|tion of the cattle. Bergius has well remarked, that this remedy is generally tried in &s;uch a random manner, as is more likely to do harm than good.
<PB N="19" REF="22">Per&s;ons have gone in the depth of winter, and dwelt for &s;everal weeks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in common cow-hou&s;es, wet, filthy, and full of air-holes, with thin walls and &s;light doors. No wonder, if under &s;uch unfavourable circum&s;tances, they have often become wor&s;e than they were before. He &s;oon &s;aw that the only way of a&s;certaining the effects of this mode of treatment, would be to fit up a room for the purpo&s;e. This was accordingly done by a gentleman of rank and fortune at Stockholm, who&s;e lady was ill of a con&s;umption. Stalls for four cows were put up in a large hall on the ground floor, and a &s;tage was rai&s;ed in the middle, &s;o high as to be even with the heads of the cattle. This &s;tage was large enough to hold the patient's bed, a table, chairs, &amp;c. The windows and other open|ings were properly clo&s;ed; and though the heat of the cattle kept the room tolerably warm, yet a little fire was lighted in the &s;tove every morning. The patient went into this apartment in the month of September. She was very far gone in a con|&s;umption. For two years pa&s;t &s;he had been gra|dually lo&s;ing &s;trength, had &s;pit blood, laboured under difficulty of breathing, hectic fever, night &s;weats, cough, and great expectoration, and was exceedingly emaciated. Her breathing was &s;o difficult, that &s;he was obliged to be rai&s;ed in her bed; and &s;he was now affected with a con&s;tant
<PB N="20" REF="23">diarrhaea and &s;welling of the ankles. She was given up by her phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Her new abode at fir&s;t appeared very &s;trange to her. The noi&s;e which the cattle made deprived her of re&s;t; for no &s;ooner had &s;he fallen a&s;leep, than &s;he &s;uddenly awoke in a fright. By degrees, however, and under the hopes of a recovery, &s;he became reconciled to her new &s;ituation. In about a month's time, there was &s;ome appearance of amendment. The diarrhaea was le&s;s urgent, and her breathing was &s;o much ea&s;ier, that &s;he could di&s;pen&s;e with &s;ome of the pillows that had been u&s;ed to &s;upport her. Before Chri&s;tmas &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ingly better. The fever was abated. The pul&s;e was become &s;low and natural, and &s;he coughed and expectorated little in the day time. The &s;welling of the feet had nearly &s;ub&s;ided, the diarrhaea had almo&s;t cea&s;ed, the difficulty of breathing was much le&s;s, and &s;he had now a pretty good appetite. After Chri&s;tmas there was an unplea&s;ant occurrence, viz. an inflammation in her eyes; which, however, was removed by proper remedies. She remained in this apartment during the re&s;t of the winter and &s;pring, till the beginning of June; when the weather becoming warm, &s;he removed into the country, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer, and by the help of milk and Seltzer water, and daily exerci&s;e on foot, &s;he
<PB N="21" REF="24">gained fle&s;h, had her catamenia again, but &s;till had &s;ome little cough, and &s;hortne&s;s of breath when &s;he walked. This amendment continued throughout the &s;ummer. In the autumn, when the weather became cold, her phy&s;icians advi&s;ed her to have recour&s;e to the cows-breath again. She could not now be prevailed upon to remain con&s;tantly in the hall where the cattle were, as before; but con&s;ented to pa&s;s her nights there, which &s;he continued to do during the &s;everity of the winter. The &s;pring following &s;he caught cold, was &s;eized with an in|flammation of the lungs, fever, &amp;c. which reduced her con&s;iderably. However, during the &s;ummer &s;he in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered; but in the autumn the phthi&s;ical &s;ymptoms again returned. She could not now be prevailed upon to try the air breathed by the cows. She kept to her own room, and died at the end of the winter. She had borne children, and was about thirty years of age. <HI>Bergius &uuml;ber Lungens&uuml;chtiger Cur im Vieh&s;talle. N. Swed. Ab|handl. 3r. Band.</HI></P>
<P>The inflammation of the eyes with which this patient was affected is, according to Bergius, a common occurrence to tho&s;e who continue for any length of time in the atmo&s;phere of cow-hou&s;es. He a&s;cribes it to the ammoniacal effluvium con|&s;tantly ari&s;ing from the excrementitious di&s;charges
<PB N="22" REF="25">from the cattle. But if this vapour or effluvium is &s;o highly acrid and &s;timulant as to produce in|flammation in the eyes, it is not likely that it &s;hould be a proper application to inflamed and ulcerated &s;urfaces of the lungs. Yet the irritation that might ari&s;e from this &s;ource, &s;eems to have been counter|acted by the lowered &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere of the apartment, in con&s;equence of the &s;ubduction of a portion of the common vital &s;timulus (dephlo|gi&s;ticated air) and of the production of a quantity of fixed air, by the re&s;piration of the cattle.</P>
<P>Although no cure was accompli&s;hed, yet the relief was &s;o con&s;iderable, that this patient's ca&s;e may be adduced as an in&s;tance of the anti-phthi&s;ical effects of an atmo&s;phere of a lowered &s;tandard. When &s;he fir&s;t breathed the air altered by the re|&s;piration of the cattle, &s;he was rapidly &s;inking under hectic fever, con&s;tant expectoration, profu&s;e &s;weats, and colliquative diarrhaea. In a few weeks the&s;e &s;ymptoms abated; at the end of three months &s;he was in every re&s;pect &s;urpri&s;ingly better; and in the beginning of &s;ummer &s;he was &s;o much re&s;tored as to be able to remove into the country, where &s;he walked out in the open air, and quickly recovered &s;trength and fle&s;h. On the return of winter, had &s;he per&s;evered in u&s;ing the remedy in the &s;ame manner as &s;he did before, more la&s;ting benefit might
<PB N="23" REF="26">have been obtained; but now &s;he would only con|&s;ent to try it during the night. Still, however, &s;ome advantage was derived, and &s;he got over an|other winter; and if &s;he had not imprudently ven|tured into the country again before the warm weather &s;et in, and could have been prevailed upon to have continued the remedy on the approach of the third winter, the event might have been dif|ferent.</P>
<P>The remark we would make upon this ca&s;e is, that if the above-mentioned rude and di&s;gu&s;ting mode of applying modified air in con&s;umptive ca&s;es is capable of affording &s;o much relief, how much more may we not expect from a proper and well-regulated application of the &s;ame? Certainly the We&s;t Indian treatment, and the cow-hou&s;e remedy, are &s;trong recommendations of the pneumatic method.</P>
<P>It may be proper to add, that in the above-mentioned ca&s;e, little other medicine, be&s;ides the modified air, was made u&s;e of. What &s;he took con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of milk and Seltzer-water, and Chervil-whey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Seandix cerefolium Linn.</HI> Chervil-whey (&s;erum lactis cerefo|liatum) is prepared according to Bergius (Mat. Med. tom. 1, p. 218) by &s;teeping the fre&s;h herb in common whey made hot, and afterwards expre&s;&s;ing the liquor from it. This &s;eems to be a fa|vourite remedy in con&s;umptions with the Swedi&s;h phy&s;icians; but Briti&s;h practitioners will not be di&s;po&s;ed to have great faith in it. Indeed it is not probable that it contributed much, if at all, to the amendment that took place.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27">
<P>If this experiment had been made in England, where the air of our rooms is &s;o partially heated, mo&s;t of the &s;alutary alterations which took place might have been attributed to the equal degree of temperature which was con&s;tantly kept up in the apartment by the warmth of the cattle; but in Sweden, where the hou&s;es are warmed by means of &s;toves, and the external air is well excluded by double windows, this explanation will not hold. In all probability the patient breathed in her own room an atmo&s;phere of the like equal temperature, with|out, however, experiencing any kind of benefit. Therefore the good effects which en&s;ued, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to &s;omething more than to warmth alone.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it does not &s;trictly belong to pneumatic medicine, the writer of the preceding ob&s;ervations cannot let go this opportunity of men|tioning, that he has found the <HI>Vapour of Aether</HI> re|markably &s;erviceable in phthi&s;ical ca&s;es. It abates the hectic fever, checks the &s;weats, removes the dy&s;pnaea, and greatly improves the &s;mell, colour,
<PB N="25" REF="28">and other qualities of the expectorated matter. Like the inflammable airs, it ab&s;tracts heat; but it does not like them induce languor, nau&s;ea, or gid|dine&s;s. On the contrary, like fixed air, it has a refre&s;hing effect. Patients who have inhaled it two or three times, find it &s;o grateful to their feel|ings, that they are di&s;po&s;ed to have recour&s;e to it too often, and cannot readily be prevailed upon to lay it a&s;ide when it is no longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>His mode of applying it, is to direct one or two tea-&s;poonfuls of aether to be poured into a tea-&s;aucer, which is held up to the mouth, and the vapour ari&s;ing from it is drawn in with the breath. The inhalation is continued till the &s;aucer becomes dry. This is repeated two or three times a day, or oftener if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t pre&s;cribed this application, he direct|ed the &s;aucer containing the aether to be placed over a tea-cup filled with hot water, in order to promote the evaporation; but he &s;oon found this to be un|nece&s;&s;ary, as this highly volatile fluid a&s;&s;umes the form of vapour rapidly enough in the common temperature of our dwelling-rooms, even in the winter time. Be&s;ides, when the &s;aucer is heated, the aether evaporates &s;o fa&s;t, that much of it is wa&s;ted; and the la&s;t part of the vapour ac|quires
<PB N="24" REF="29"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="25" REF="30"><GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="26" REF="31">an empyreumatic taint, which, though it may not be hurtful, is very unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>None but well rectified aether &s;hould be u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. Le&s;t it &s;hould contain any loo&s;e acid, it is advi&s;eable to put a little alkaline &s;alt into the bottle in which it is kept, and to &s;hake them together now and then. Hitherto he has only pre|&s;cribed vitriolic aether. Nitrous and muriatic aethers would be highly improper.</P>
<P>Aether impregnated with mu&s;k, camphor, opi|um, a&s;afoetida, and the like, may in &s;ome ca&s;es be preferable to pure aether. The&s;e ingredients, how|ever, &s;hould be added only in &s;mall quantities; otherwi&s;e &s;ickne&s;s, giddine&s;s, and other unplea&s;ant &s;ymptoms will ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Where, as in certain a&s;thmatic affections, the object is to remove &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction of the bronchia, and to promote expectoration, the aether may be impregnated with &s;quill, by adding to it either tincture of &s;quill, or &s;quill triturated with a little water of ammonia, as aether alone does not &s;eem to di&s;&s;olve this drug in any great quantity. The finer particles of the &s;quill applied to the lungs in this manner along with the vapour of aether,
<PB N="27" REF="32">gently &s;timulate the &s;ecreting &s;urfaces of the bron|chia, and promote the mucous di&s;charge; and if applied in &s;ufficient quantity produce &s;ickne&s;s, which takes off the &s;pa&s;m, and is otherwi&s;e &s;erviceable in &s;uch ca&s;es. An emetic given in this manner is very different from an emetic thrown into the &s;tomach in the ordinary way; for be&s;ides having the &s;ame general effect upon the &s;y&s;tem with this la&s;t, it has at the &s;ame time a peculiar topical ope|ration.</P>
<P>But on this &s;ubject the author refrains from further remarks at pre&s;ent, intending to give a more parti|cular account of the u&s;es of the <HI>Vapour of Aether</HI> on a future occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time this vapour is not to be con&s;ider|ed as equal in power with Factitious Airs. Where-ever they can be had, they &s;eem to be entitled to the preference; but where they cannot be procured, or where there are objections to their u&s;e, this ea&s;y and &s;imple application will in many ca&s;es be found to be no bad &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
