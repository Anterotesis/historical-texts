<HEAD>AN ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>WE read, in the Holy Scriptures, not only of wine that maketh glad the heart of man, but of oil to make his face to &s;hine, or his out&s;ide, for &s;o the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> fre|quently &s;ignifies, and it ought, in this place, P&s;alm civ. 15. &s;o to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The ancients accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to the outward application of oil, in order to heighten the comeline&s;s of their per&s;ons&mdash;and they did well: for what con&s;titutes beauty more than the natural diffu&s;ion of gelatinous juices extracted from the aliment, and brought forward, through the arteries, to all parts of the body? or, if the&s;e be wanting, what better &s;ub&s;titute can there be than oils properly applied?</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>This practice of inunction was &s;o general, and &s;o frequent, that our Saviour gently reproved Simon, the Phari&s;ee, for omitting this in&s;tance of civility. Luke vii. 46.&mdash;The rich and honourable were anointed with oils of the greate&s;t fragrance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash; <GAP DESC="foreign">. HOMER.</NOTE> Thus due re&s;pect was &s;hewn to our ble&s;&s;ed Lord by having precious ointment poured upon his head. Mark xxvi. 7.</P>
<P>But the ancients u&s;ed oil not only for the decoration and refre&s;hment of their per&s;ons, but for the pre&s;ervation of their health and &s;trength. After bathing, they rubbed them|&s;elves over with ceromata to clo&s;e the pores of the body,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> and thus to give &s;trength to the &s;y&s;tem. They al&s;o anointed their heads with ointments to prevent drunkenne&s;s.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. ANACREON.</NOTE> (Athenaeus lib. xv. cap. 13.) Before en|gaging
<PB N="7" REF="6">in violent and fatiguing exerci&s;es, they always u&s;ed ceromata, or medicated oils, to prevent &s;trains, to make their limbs &s;upple, and, by hindering tran&s;piration, to preclude any great wa&s;te of &s;trength. Now although it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the an|cients were not the mo&s;t improved anato|mi&s;ts, yet their general and frequent prac|tice in the u&s;e of ointments and friction was excellent, being very preventative of di&s;ea&s;e, and conducive to health, as will appear from the following &s;tatement of facts.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. All over the human body are innu|merable inhalants, which are the orifices and branches of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els that ultimately terminate in the great veins near the heart. The&s;e ab&s;orb and carry fluids <HI>into</HI> the body, but they cannot carry any <HI>out.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. There are al&s;o innumerable exha|lants, which perforate the &s;urface of the &s;kin, that are the extremities of the arteries, and which carry fluids <HI>out</HI> of the body, but they cannot carry any <HI>in.</HI> According to Sanctorius, the tran&s;piration from the &s;kin
<PB N="8" REF="7">far exceeds, in quantity, all the excretions by the other emunctories, and, comparative|ly to alvine di&s;charges, the proportion is as one to four, &s;o that if the &s;kin ejects twenty-four, the inte&s;tines &s;hall di&s;charge only &s;ix ounces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If by any means the exhalants be &s;o clo&s;ed, as to hinder the greater part of tran&s;piration, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the <HI>deliciae animalis vitae,</HI> that is to &s;ay, good eating, may be ren|dered, for a time, unnece&s;&s;ary; for it appears in &s;tory, that wetting the body with &s;alt water, prevented hunger in &s;ix people, who were on a raft in the &s;ea for &s;ix days in the Gulph of Mexico; and Captain Bligh of the Bounty experienced the &s;ame effect after he had been turned adrift, in a boat, by his crew, in the Pacific Ocean.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Animal, or vital heat, which is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the nutrition and pre&s;er|vation of the body, is generated by the de|compo&s;ition in the lungs of atmo&s;pheric air by animal gas<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">BOERHAAVE, MARTIN, and others, were of opinion, that the motion of the blood was the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of animal heat. If &s;o, how is it that the vital heat is nearly the &s;ame in all per&s;ons in health, although the circulation of the blood be very different? How is it that the vital heat &s;hall be the &s;ame in a young lady, &s;itting at her &s;ampler, as in a &s;awyer, in the violent exerci&s;e of his trade? The circulation &s;hall be far above par in one, and below it in the other; but, neverthe|le&s;s, the vital heat &s;hall be the &s;ame in both!</NOTE> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plenck.</NOTE>. And hence it is, that the
<PB N="9" REF="8">more and quicker we in&s;pire atmo&s;pheric ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the warmer we become, as in running up hill, or in vehement reading and &s;peaking.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vegetables per&s;pire from their leaves as animals from their lungs. This vegetable per&s;pirable matter, when acted upon by the &s;un's light, produces the pure part of the at|mo&s;pheric, or vital air; hence it is, that exerci&s;e in a garden, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> is far more &s;alubrious than in the &s;treets of a city.</NOTE> That vital heat is generated by the afore&s;aid decompo&s;ition in the lungs, appears from con&s;idering that animals, de&s;titute of lungs, are not hotter than the circumambient air, whereas the vital heat of animals po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lungs is by no means dependent on the tem|perature of the air. In the human body it is hardly ever le&s;s than 95 degrees, or more than 105 of <HI>Fahrenheit's</HI> tongue thermometer; but if the living body, in a healthy &s;tate, be placed in contact to much hotter bodies, it will not acquire their exce&s;s; nor, if in the mid&s;t of much colder bodies, will it acquire their coldne&s;s; thus, on the coa&s;t of Africa, where the heat of the climate &s;hall ri&s;e to 140 degrees of <HI>Fahrenheit's</HI> thermometer, the human body will retain its natural heat of 96 degrees, becau&s;e of the evaporation of
<PB N="10" REF="9">&s;weat which generates coldne&s;s; hence it is, that the negroes in the We&s;t India I&s;lands endure labour in the &s;un far better than white men, becau&s;e, as it is &s;aid, of their quicker evaporation of per&s;pirable matter from their &s;kin and lungs. So again in the frozen re|gions of the North, the heat of the living body &s;hall experience no material change; and this is providential, for if the living body had not the means to re&s;i&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The heat of the room in which Dr. Blagden, and others, entered, was rai&s;ed, whilft they were in it, to 240^o, and to 260^o; the&s;e exce&s;&s;ive heats were borne for a con&s;iderable time, with little inconvenience, by the gentlemen who ex|po&s;ed them&s;elves to them, both naked and with their clothes on; nor was the <HI>heat</HI> of Dr. Blagden's body at all <HI>increa&s;ed,</HI> though the velocity of his pul&s;e was, in one in&s;tance, more than doubled. A bla&s;t of the heated air from a pair of bellows was &s;earcely to be endured, for the following obvious rea&s;on: When the &s;ame air remained for any time in contact with the body, part of its heat was de&s;troyed, and, con&s;equently, the body was &s;urrounded with a colder medium than the air of the room; whereas, when fre&s;h portions of the air were applied to the body in &s;uch a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that no part of it could remain in contact a &s;ufficient time to be cooled, the heat was &s;ea&s;ibly greater.
<P><HI>Vide</HI> CHAMBERS'S Dictionary, under the article HEAT.</P></NOTE> the fluids would become too thin, run out, or putrify; and if it could not re|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="10">exce&s;&s;ive cold, the fluids of the body could not circulate, and, of cour&s;e, become coagulant.</P>
<P>This vital heat is the cau&s;e of that &s;trong inte&s;tine action by which the &s;olids of the body are expanded, the fluids broke down and divided, and &s;uperfluous and heteroge|neous matter &s;eparated and di&s;charged. When it is &s;ufficiently &s;trong, in a healthy &s;tate,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This vital heat may be in exce&s;s, as in hectic and in|flammatory fevers, acute rheumati&s;m, &amp;c. <HI>Que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI>&mdash;Is not vitiated air, in jails, when combined with animal gas, pro|ductive of patrid mia&s;ma?</NOTE> it forces the blood and juices into the extreme arteries, the &s;kin becomes &s;oft and glowing, and the fle&s;h turge&s;cent from that bland oleaginous aliment &s;o well, and &s;o univer|&s;ally diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Friction, although far le&s;s pre|&s;ervative and re&s;torative than bodily exerci&s;e in the open country air, e&s;pecially if u&s;ed to the point of fatigue, yet, in one particular, it is more &s;erviceable, becau&s;e of its topical application.</P>
<P>Friction, by obliging the veins to admit of di&s;ten&s;ion, cau&s;es the arterial blood more
<PB N="12" REF="11">abundantly to flow into them, hereby en|crea&s;ing the velocity of the circulation, dif|fu&s;ing the vital heat, and augmenting vigour; moreover, the venal blood, by means of friction, runs quicker towards the heart, which it &s;timulates to a greater propul&s;ion of the blood and juices over the whole body.</P>
<P>If cold coagulated blood be rubbed, in a gla&s;s mortar, it will again become a frothy liquid of a crim&s;on colour. It is &s;aid, indeed, that this effect ari&s;es from fre&s;h &s;urfaces of blood being expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;pheric air, with the oxygen, of which it immediately combines, re&s;toring it to the &s;ame floridity as when in the body; neverthele&s;s, it is al&s;o true, that gentle friction &s;o attenuates &s;tag|nant blood, in brui&s;es, that it will enter into the mouths of the bibulous veins.</P>
<P>Friction moves and attenuates the other|wi&s;e immeable juices in the ve&s;&s;els that en|cumber and relax the nervous &s;y&s;tem; but if vehemently and immoderately u&s;ed it excites inflammation, and, by too much, encrea&s;ing the contraction of the heat and arteries, the liquids exhale, and the body becomes parch|ed and dry. Immoderate labour, in like
<PB N="13" REF="12" MS="y">manner, is prejudicial to the health, and it prevents longevity, for hard-working people &s;oon look old; and it is ob&s;ervable, that women, in general, live longer than men.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Oil, whether contained in the ce|lular membrane of the body, or externally applied, greatly, by its lubricity, facilitates mu&s;cular motion. It keeps off the coldne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere; hence, fat per&s;ons are not &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of cold as lean people, and it is the be&s;t preventive again&s;t chilblains. It gives whitene&s;s to the tender &s;kin; hence it is, that the fatte&s;t parts of the body are the white&s;t, as the brea&s;ts of young women.&mdash;It gives roundne&s;s and beauty to the hu|man form; for the &s;kin, when not di&s;tended by it, contracts it&s;elf into un&s;ightly wrinkles. It gives nouri&s;hment to the body, for being ab&s;orbed by the inhalants, it is carried, with the chyle, into the blood. If it be &s;aid that oil, externally applied, &s;tops the excretory pores, thereby preventing &s;weat and in&s;en|&s;ible per&s;piration, I an&s;wer, from my own experience, that it does not, but it rather promotes both, e&s;pecially if applied by bri&s;k friction, for it clean&s;es the exhalants of that
<PB N="14" REF="13">ever encru&s;ting luting &s;ordes, which covers even the mo&s;t delicate per&s;ons, and which the vapour bath &s;oon di&s;covers to every indi|vidual.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cuticle, or upper &s;kin, by time, wears rough, and decays, and a new one is generated; hence it is, that &s;er|penes and &s;hell-fi&s;h, every &s;ummer, become new coated. Vegetables and trees &s;eem to have this property, according to the ingenious Mr. FORSYTH's experiments on this curious &s;ubject.</NOTE> The ancients, who were in the frequent practice of inunction, never found plain oil to &s;top the pores; for when they wi&s;hed to &s;top or hinder tran&s;piration, they u&s;ed wax with their oil; &s;uch were the precious ceromata, mentioned by Athenaeus, (Deipno&s;oph 5.) as of &s;affron, &s;weet mar|joram, fenugreek, flower-de-luce, and of ro&s;es; and not thinking even the&s;e prepa|rations &s;ufficiently ob&s;tructive of the pores, they, before engaging in gymna&s;tic exer|ci&s;es, and after anointing them&s;elves with oil, rolled them&s;elves in the &s;and.</P>
<P>From what I have written concerning the inhalants, the exhalants, vital heat, friction and oil, I think, that the following practice will be thought, by the public, rea&s;onable, u&s;eful and important.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="14" MS="y">
<P>In incipient drop&s;y, particularly the leuco|phlegmatic, and ana&s;arcous (ari&s;ing from the debility of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem), the chief cure is to &s;trengthen the ve&s;&s;els by friction, and a &s;timulating oil; &s;o that the ab&s;orbents &s;hall take up the water from the cavities, and the per&s;piratory powers recover their wonted action. That the drop&s;y does not ari&s;e, as is commonly imagined, from an atony, or laxity of the whole body, and the vi&s;cera thereof, appears from this con&s;idera|tion, that many cachectic per&s;ons are not drop&s;ical, and many who have ci&s;ted drop&s;y, are entirely free from any cachexy what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>In chronic rheumati&s;m, owing to a &s;e|rous colluvies of humours predominant about the moving fibres of the mu&s;cles; as al&s;o in &s;tiffne&s;s, and rigidity of the joints and mu&s;cles, particularly in old military men, ari&s;ing from frequent and long ex|po&s;ures to the injuries of the weather, and from old healed-up wounds and fractures; medicated oils, with a fle&s;h-bru&s;h, together with electrical &s;hocks on the &s;tiffened parts, will be found very &s;erviceable.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>The fibres of old people are hard and ri|gid, their per&s;piration is little, and that bland vapour which formerly bedewed their bodies is no more; inunction, with friction to them, is mo&s;t &s;alutary, for the animal warmth and juices are hereby drawn into the &s;kin, and the oil, by its nouri&s;hing powers, renovates and invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem. The &s;agacious Sydenham had great &s;ucce&s;s in the recovery of debilitated nature, by re|commending healthy young men as bedfel|lows to the aged and infirm; he &s;aid, that heat alone was not the cau&s;e of re&s;toration, for the application of warm napkins did no good, (&s;ec. i. cap. iv. p. 79.) it was therefore only to be a&s;cribed to the mild oleaginous effluvia. Now, if the human oleaginous effluvia be &s;o penetrating and bal&s;amic as to afford revivifying nouri&s;hment by ab&s;orp|tion, why &s;hould not the oil of &s;weet-al|monds, for in&s;tance, do the &s;ame thing, e&s;pecially when broke down and pre&s;&s;ed in, by heat and friction.</P>
<P>Soldiers that are expo&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive heats in hot countries, &s;hould frequently be ordered to rub their bodies with ceromata, to prevent
<PB N="17" REF="16">too great a wa&s;te of &s;trength by per&s;piration; and when in cold countries, they are expo&s;ed to rain, and &s;leep in damp camps, they &s;hould be enjoined to follow the practice of inunc|tion; for being generally young men, &s;uch &s;timuli would quickly arou&s;e their native heat, draw it to the &s;urface, and keep it there, and al&s;o, by clo&s;ing the inhalants, effectually &s;hut out an otherwi&s;e too pene|trating a humidity.</P>
<P>After hard labour, or exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, the outward u&s;e of oil is wonderfully re&s;tora|tive and refre&s;hing: this is not only te&s;tified by the practice of the ancient Athletae, but by &s;ome mowers at Hendon, this &s;ummer, who, before the application, were nearly exhau&s;ted by exce&s;&s;ive labour at ta&s;k work, but af|terwards followed it up with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>After warm bathing in the winter &s;ea&s;on, the application of a ceroma is very advi&s;e|able, for by rendering the inhalants imper|vious to the cold air, colds are prevented, and, by clo&s;ing the orifices of exhalants, the dewy, nutritious juice, and vital heat (drawn towards the &s;kin by the bath) is then re|tained,
<PB N="18" REF="17">which mu&s;t greatly warm and invi|gorate the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>An imperfect paraly&s;is in the aged, not only ari&s;es from a deficiency of vigour, and a relaxation of nerves, &s;trained and worn by various de&s;troying cau&s;es, as gluttony, ebriety, &amp;c. but often it is owing to a &s;u|pinene&s;s of the vital principle, or the Anima-Medica,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the curious and elegant oration of the late learned Dr. Nicholls, (Phy&s;ician to George the IId.) on the Powers of the Anima Medica, before the College of Phy&s;icians in London.</NOTE> for terror, or imminent danger, has often been the means of re&s;toring tho&s;e limbs (during the paroxy&s;m of fear) that were before u&s;ele&s;s. Here then it &s;eems, that impotency is not the cau&s;e, but &s;loth; &s;urely then the natural and be&s;t cure mu&s;t be ob|tained from exerci&s;e, friction, and &s;timulat|ing oil.</P>
<P>Chilly, &s;edentary per&s;ons who ill endure the winter's cold, &s;hould frequently u&s;e friction, and a &s;timulating oil, for it is, through debility from want of exertion, that the arteries do not propel the fluids with &s;uch force as would prove &s;ufficient to di&s;|tend the exhalants in the &s;kin.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>A nervous unhappine&s;s, with &s;u&s;ceptibi|lity of cold is often occa&s;ioned by a thick cacochymy of humours, not at all inflam|matory; in this ca&s;e, after proper evacua|tion, it is proper to draw the juices to the &s;urface of the body by light frictions with the aromata, &s;o indeed as to promote the due circulation of the blood, but not by violent application, to encumber the heart and lungs by the reflux of the&s;e thick and foul hu|mours. The mind of man may be con|&s;idered figuratively as the axle-tree, round which the wheel of life can be&s;t turn, for although it may be uncon&s;cious of its power, yet it works wonders on the &s;olids and fluids of the body, rectifying their irregularity, and reducing them to moderation, or el&s;e rendering them inordinate and de&s;tructive. But if the mind have power over the body, &s;o al&s;o has the body a wonder-working power over the mind, for it is the blood that con|&s;titutes the <HI>temperament</HI> of different per&s;ons. The red part abounds in the <HI>&s;anguineous,</HI> who&s;e veins are large and cerulean, the head thin of hair, the fle&s;h &s;oft and abundant, and the cheeks of a ro&s;y colour. Per|&s;ons
<PB N="20" REF="19">of this temperament are fond of plea|&s;ure, they are &s;oon but not long angry, ea&s;ily per&s;uaded and incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>The albumenous part of the blood abounds in the petuitous, who&s;e veins are &s;mall and almo&s;t imperceptible; the face pale, the fle&s;h abundant, but cold and flaccid. The mind is u&s;ually placid and &s;erene, regardful of deco|rum, and of the hone&s;tum, and of what it ought to do, but generally too lazy to exert its powers.</P>
<P>When the blood is too concrete, having lo&s;t its proper fluidity, it forms the melan|cholic temperament. The fle&s;h and hair are of a very dark colour, as among the Jews, (who are commonly of this temperament) the head frequently bald. The body is very lean and dry, the blood ve&s;&s;els den&s;e and thin. The mind is con&s;tant to its purpo&s;e, not ha&s;ty, mindful of injuries, and remarkable for earne&s;tne&s;s in thinking.</P>
<P>From the&s;e temperaments are made up the re&s;t, as the bilious, where the body is thin, the colour brown, the hair black, cri&s;p and bu&s;hy, the veins large, the mind intelligent and re&s;olute.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<P>The phlegmatic are cold, not hairy, &s;ub|ject to baldne&s;s, fat and unweildly, liable to tumours, the mind &s;ometimes timid, generally inoffen&s;ive. The warm temperament is in body agile and robu&s;t, well covered with yel|low, thick, and copious pile, as the head with hair; the angles of the eyes, and al&s;o the face and lips are of a very red colour, the pul&s;e full and frequent, the mind capable, but impetuous.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s, to vindicate the &s;upre|macy of the mind over the body, it is to be ob&s;erved that, by the medicinal and dietetic art, one temperament may be altered, in &s;ome degree into another, &s;o that the pi|tuitous may become &s;anguineous, the &s;an|guineous melancholic <HI>et vice ver&s;a.</HI> St. Paul &s;aith, <Q>"I keep my body under, and bring it into &s;ubjection: le&s;t that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t away." <BIBL>1 Cor. ix. 27.</BIBL></Q> Undoubtedly the mind can, and often does reduce the body to rea&s;on, by the means of diet and the forbearing virtues; hence the u&s;e of fa&s;ting and religious meditation: but here ob&s;erve, that what would &s;timulate one
<PB N="22" REF="21">per&s;on, &s;ay of a hot temperament, into pa&s;|&s;ion, might only lift up another who is pitu|itous into rea&s;onable comfort.</P>
<P>Phlegmatic per&s;ons of irritable habits of body (who&s;e circulation is weak, the blood not being &s;ent in &s;ufficient force to the &s;ur|face, &s;o as in a due degree, to promote per|&s;piration, and who by their inhalants, ab&s;orb more moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere than &s;tronger people), &s;hould per&s;everingly u&s;e friction, if not oil; they &s;hould al&s;o pay particular attention to diet. They &s;hould avoid &s;ugar and butter, which, by thick|ening the juices, impedes the circulation. In&s;tead of eating glary food, as pig-meat and fatted calf, they &s;hould be contented with a more drying and attenuating diet, which would prevent alarming portions of lymph from collecting in the lungs, or in the joints. True indeed it is, that al|though a per&s;on be charged with too much lymph he may continue in health, but how long the&s;e defluxions may remain benign and unhurtful, no one can &s;ay, for al&s;o true it is, that, by the adver&s;e diameters of a very few ve&s;&s;els, the juices may &s;oon become
<PB N="23" REF="22">&s;tagnant and banefully acrimonious. The too abundant lymph &s;hould be di&s;charged by dra&s;tic purges, at long intervals, and for diet, &s;uch as &s;trengthens the ela&s;ticity of the fibres, &s;hould be recommended. Roa&s;t meat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Roa&s;ting, except the little that flies off by vapour, con|centrates the juices of the meat within it, giving the meat an empyreumatic and &s;timulating flavour; whereas, boiling di&s;charges the gelatinous part and e&s;&s;ential oil of the meat into the water, rendering it in&s;apid; therefore, it will not. I believe, be too much to &s;ay, that half a pound of roa&s;t will afford as much nouri&s;hment with a greater &s;timulus, as three quarters of a pound of boiled meat; moreover, the organs of dige&s;tion require fibrous matter to work upon, as will appear from the following experiment, which, I heard, was tried by an eminent &s;urgeon in London: He confined one large dog to the broth of meat boiled down, as we &s;ay, to rags, and another large dog to the ragged meat &s;o boiled down, allow|ing him, I &s;uppo&s;e, a little water to quench his thir&s;t. The dog that drank the broth &s;oon became emaciated, and died; but he that eat the fibres of the meat remained in health, and grew fat.
<P>The old French way of dre&s;&s;ing meat with little or no water, but with a few vegetables, as potatoes, in a pan &s;o clo&s;ely covered or luted, as to confine all the vapour or e&s;&s;ential oil within, is, <HI>me judice,</HI> the mo&s;t palatable, and the be&s;t mode of cookery.</P></NOTE> and game are proper; fruits, if any, &s;hould be &s;omewhat au&s;tere, and al&s;o the wine; &s;ay good rough port, but ever let this dietetic rule be carefully ob&s;erved, <HI>"ne quid nemis."</HI></P>
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<P>Wine, if medically taken, augments the &s;trength of the animal fibres and rarifies the juices of the body; but if immoderately drank, it excites a univer&s;al &s;pa&s;m that ends in weakne&s;s and relaxation, as the trembling hands and &s;taggering gate of bacchanalians &s;ufficiently evince. Wine after much u&s;e lo&s;es its &s;timulating power; hence it is that hard-drinkers proceed from bad to wor&s;e, from wine to the drinking of pure &s;pirit; thus de&s;troying their health, their reputation, and their life, for a very tran&s;ient and mi&s;er|able &s;atisfaction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In general debility brought on by drinking &s;pirituous liquors, with lo&s;s of appetite, it is, fir&s;t, advi&s;able for the patient to leave off drinking one fourth of his u&s;ual quan|tity: if, in a fortnight, his appetite &s;omewhat returns, let him leave off another fourth part, and &s;o every fortnight continue the decrea&s;e, 'till the burning potation be totally ex|changed for a daily, but &s;mall quantity of red port wine. If indeed, the natural powers of dige&s;tion be quite de&s;troyed, by the means of &s;pirituous liquors, then there is but little hope of re&s;toration.</NOTE> But wine, if mode|rately taken, enables the ve&s;&s;els of the body with encrea&s;ed alacrity to take up and di&s;per&s;e nouri&s;hment over the &s;y&s;tem. It is of excel|lent u&s;e after fatigue; al&s;o in the cure of mental languors, and in urgent fears, for it
<PB N="25" REF="24">not only braces the fibres, but it tonifies the mind; and therefore it is that &s;oldiers and &s;ailors after a dram of &s;pirituous liquor, de&s;pi&s;e danger, and joyou&s;ly enter into a battle.</P>
<P>Again, pituitous per&s;ons who u&s;e but little exerci&s;e, are particularly &s;u&s;ceptible of the ill effects of a damp air, which although, by the thermometer, may not be colder than a dry one, is more penetrating becau&s;e <HI>it con|ducts</HI> better, filling the inhalants with crude noxious vapour; hence &s;wellings of the great joints of the limbs are frequent, which are mi&s;taken for the gout. Certainly the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives are &s;trong daily exerci&s;e to the point of fatigue, &s;o as to &s;weat; a dry cardiac diet; frequent friction with ceromata of e&s;&s;ential oil, to counteract the baneful ef|fects of the atmo&s;phere; and &s;uch cloathing as of wool clo&s;e to the &s;kin, which, being a bad conductor, will prevent the inhalants from improper ab&s;orption.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By warm cloathing, we may indeed avoid in part, a cold humidity, but if we would do &s;o entirely, the face and the hands mu&s;t be al&s;o cloathed; whereas, by counteracting the humi|dity of the air by &s;timulants and e&s;&s;ential oils, every good effect will be an&s;wered, without acquiring the bad habit of too warm cloathing.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<P>It is al&s;o not uncommon for &s;uch per&s;ons to be troubled with an aqueous, not a chyli|ferous, diabetes, for by checked exhalation, what is not di&s;charged by per&s;piration and &s;weat, pa&s;&s;es through the bladder; and their too copious ab&s;orption of circumambient fluids doubtle&s;s encrea&s;es the quantity of urine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Per&s;piratio ad urinam in ae&s;tate e&s;t in ratione, 5. 3; in hyeme vero ut, 2. 3.</NOTE> This very common, and too un|noticed, yet dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, may, I think, be abated if not entirely cured, by the fol|lowing practice: &mdash; If it ari&s;e from hectic fever, mucilages (perhaps with acids to cor|rect the hectic) are &s;erviceable; but if from hy&s;teric, or any tran&s;itory relaxing cau&s;es, mucilages and diffu&s;ible &s;timuli are more proper. In either ca&s;e the <HI>primae viae</HI> &s;hould be clean&s;ed fir&s;t by ipecacuanha, then by rhubarb; &s;trengtheners, and mild a&s;trin|gents &s;hould be u&s;ed; a dry binding diet, and morning and evening friction in a warm room, with a defen&s;ive oil again&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="26">damp weather,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cold gives additional &s;trength to per&s;ons already &s;trong in health, becau&s;e of the re-action of the vital power, and becau&s;e the air may be nearly uncharged with vapour, and therefore more of it, in a given time, is inhaled; but cold debilitates very weak and &s;edentary people, becau&s;e of the want of re-action. Damp and cold air, or damp and hot air, is hurtful to all per&s;ons, becau&s;e le&s;s pure air, and too much humidity is inhaled by the &s;kin and lungs. Certainly the healthie&s;t is the warm and dry atmo&s;phere, which ought to be a con&s;ideration of &s;ome weight to valetudinarians who can afford either to change their re&s;idence, or to make it com|fortable.</NOTE> &s;hould be earne&s;tly recom|mended.</P>
<P>Sometimes cold and damp air &s;hall &s;o relax the nervous &s;y&s;tem, as to deprive the patient of the u&s;e of his limbs; then a bri&s;k vomit and the application, by friction, of warm medicated oil on the back bone, or on the inert limbs, will be of great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e of children, called the rickets, after di&s;charging the redundant lymph by vomits and detergent do&s;es of rhubarb, is to be cured by friction, and with woollen cloths properly fumigated.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to &s;ee, in young &s;e|dentary people, the &s;kin di&s;coloured, the mu&s;cles lank, the face pale and variou&s;ly di&s;|figured
<PB N="28" REF="27">with pu&s;tules; the &s;pirits gener|ally in a low &s;tate, and the body &s;luggi&s;h. The cure is to excite the per&s;piratory powers by bodily labour, friction, roa&s;t meat, and wine; and to heal the face by lenient in|noxious liniment.</P>
<P>Old &s;trains, and &s;tubborn pains in the back, loins, and el&s;ewhere, are, for the mo&s;t part, curable by friction and medicated oil, and even incipient white &s;wellings, that would otherwi&s;e cripple or render the limb u&s;ele&s;s, are thus to be di&s;per&s;ed and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Dry white &s;caly eruptions on the elbows and knees, even of long &s;tanding, may be cured by friction and medicated oil;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When, through neglect, the hair of the head in children becomes matted and &s;tuck together, by a vi&s;cid humour that the exhalants ca&s;t upon the &s;kin, the &s;afe&s;t and &s;peedie&s;t cure, after cutting off the hair, is, daily to &s;punge the head with hot water, always taking care, after &s;punging, to dry the head well with hot cloths.</NOTE> and here I mu&s;t remark, that although the cure of the &s;ea &s;curvy may be obtained by the vegetable acid of oranges and lemons, yet I &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of the &s;urgeons of the navy, whether or not, rubbing the
<PB N="29" REF="28">oil of the rinds on the di&s;ea&s;ed parts, would not accelerate the cure.</P>
<P>After fevers, and &s;ome chronical di&s;|ea&s;es, the hair of the head falls off, either becau&s;e the &s;kin &s;hrinks and becomes dry, through want of nutritious juices, or becau&s;e through di&s;ea&s;ed relaxation, the &s;tabulum of the hair becomes too weak. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, baldne&s;s may be cured by oily liniments. In the &s;econd, good &s;trengtheners of the &s;y&s;tem will be found mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>If this publication &s;hould &s;erve as a hint to a more enlarged mode of medical practice than the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall, as a Clergyman of the Church of England, mo&s;t heartily rejoice as having been the humble means of doing &s;ome good to my fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that I had been &s;even years in holy orders, before I became doctor of phy&s;ic, at Leyden, never thinking it at all improper to blend two very u&s;eful profe&s;&s;ions together, and more e&s;pe|cially, as our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf healed the di&s;ea&s;es of the body as well as of the &s;oul.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="29">
<P>Indeed, I am &s;trongly of opinion, as I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved in my Philan|thropic Monitor, that the public and private good re&s;ulting from &s;uch a union of profe&s;|&s;ions, would be great and incalculable. The unbeneficed clergy (being phy&s;icians) would enlarge the &s;phere of their u&s;efulne&s;s, e&s;pe|cially among&s;t the poor people, and by ac|cepting moderate fees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A vi&s;it near the practitioner's re&s;idence might be rated at half-a-guinea. If two miles off, one guinea, and &s;o on, <HI>in modo.</HI> Journeys in the night, and in bad weather, when car|riages mu&s;t be hired, de&s;erve a larger con&s;ideration.</NOTE> from the yeomanry and gentry, they would &s;oon di&s;entangle them&s;elves from that poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, which is as &s;ubver&s;ive of their re&s;pectabi|lity in civilized life, as of their de&s;erved comfort.</P>
<P>To the public at large, the advantages would be very great, having able prac|titioners always near at hand, and the pre|&s;ent enormous expence of cure &s;o properly cut down as to exclude none from the benefit of good medical advice.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="30">
<P>If it be &s;aid, that the clergy would not be &s;o competent in the healing art as the fa|culty, I will a&s;k why not? They have the &s;ame advantages of learning at Oxford and Cambridge, where there are ho&s;pitals, as other medical &s;tudents, and if degrees in phy&s;ic are thought to be particularly ho|nourable from Oxford and Cambridge, &s;urely the competency ought not to be di&s;puted. By this union of profe&s;&s;ions in the clergy, as phy&s;icians, no injury would be done to &s;urgeons, apothecaries, and chymi&s;ts, nor no inju&s;tice to phy&s;icians of e&s;tabli&s;hed fame and practice; for, if &s;ucce&s;sful, they would &s;till retain their patients, and even encrea&s;e the number, though, po&s;&s;ibly, they might re|ceive fees more &s;uitable to their re&s;pective merit.</P>
