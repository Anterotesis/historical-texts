<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT Of a particular KIND of RUPTURE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>_IN performing the operation for what is called a Strangulated Rupture, the portion of in|te&s;tine, or omentum, which had pa&s;&s;ed out from the abdomen, has &s;ometimes been found in the &s;ame cavity, and in contact with the naked te&s;ticle.</P>
<P>THIS is a ca&s;e which has been men|tioned by one or two late writers, who have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be produced by a
<PB N="2" REF="3">breach, or laceration, of that production of the peritoneum, which formed the hernial &s;ac, and contained the portion of inte&s;tine, or omentum, when fir&s;t it pa&s;&s;ed out from the belly.</P>
<P>IN order to under&s;tand rightly the kind of rupture, which makes the &s;ub|ject of my pre&s;ent inquiry, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a general de&s;crip|tion of the more frequent &s;pecies of in|te&s;tinal and omental rupture, and to &s;hew wherein con&s;i&s;ts the e&s;&s;ential dif|ference between the&s;e and that.</P>
<P>THE portion of inte&s;tine or omen|tum, which by being thru&s;t forth from the cavity of the belly, forms a common rupture, is contained in a firm, &s;trong, membranous pouch or bag, called the hernial &s;ac: this &s;ac is formed by a production of the peritoneum, pu&s;hed out by the inte&s;tine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> through the opening in the tendon of the obliquus de&s;cendens mu&s;cle of the abdomen, pa&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="3" REF="4">in &s;ome no lower than the groin, in others into the lower part of the &s;crotum.</P>
<P>THE peritoneum, of which this &s;ac is formed, is extremely dilatable, as preg|nancy, drop&s;y, and many di&s;ea&s;es prove; and in&s;tead of &s;eeming thereby in dan|ger of bur&s;ting, is frequently found to become thicker and &s;tronger in propor|tion to its di&s;tention.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ac are contained a portion of inte&s;tine, or omentum, (or both) and a &s;mall quantity of a fluid; the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s down behind it, and its cavity is perfectly di&s;tinct from, and has no communication with, that &s;acculus in which the te&s;ticle is generally included.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;uccinct account of a com|mon inte&s;tinal or omental rupture; but in that which makes my pre&s;ent &s;ubject, the inte&s;tine or omentum, or both, are found in the &s;ame bag, and in contact with the naked te&s;ticle.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P>THEY who &s;uppo&s;e this to be pro|duced by a breach, or laceration of the peritoneum, &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that the inte&s;|tine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pa&s;&s;ed out from the abdomen in a hernial &s;ac, &s;ormed in the u&s;ual manner; that this &s;ac originally com|po&s;ed a cavity perfectly di&s;tinct from that in which the te&s;ticle was included (cal|led tunica vaginalis te&s;tis); but that by &s;ome means this &s;ac &s;uffers a breach or laceration, that the membrane which divides the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis, from the tunica vaginalis of the chord, is broke through al&s;o, and that by this means the inte&s;tine and te&s;ticle are brought into contact with each other in the &s;ame common cavity.</P>
<P>BY this means the ancient doctrine of a hernia cau&s;ed by breach or rupture of the peritoneum, is revived, though the di&s;&s;ection of the parts has always proved it to be untrue; the peritoneum forming a hernial &s;ac, whatever &s;ize it may be
<PB N="5" REF="6">di&s;tended to, being always found entire, unle&s;s it has been wounded, or is mor|tified.</P>
<P>RUPTURES attended with that parti|cular circum&s;tance which brings them under the de&s;cription mentioned in the Title, are &s;aid to be very rare; but, from what I have ob&s;erved, both in the living, and in the dead, I am inclined to be|lieve that they happen much oftner to adults, than they are &s;u&s;pected to do.</P>
<P>WHEN I publi&s;hed my <HI>General Trea|ti&s;e on Ruptures,</HI> I had not enough con|&s;idered this particular kind, to be able to &s;ay any thing po&s;itive concerning it; I thought the breach of the peritoneum highly improbable, and from what I had &s;een of the ca&s;e, was &s;ure that it mu&s;t be owing to &s;ome other cau&s;e; but, as I was not perfectly &s;atisfied what that was, I did not chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ert any thing about it, and &s;poke of it as a thing not frequent, and produced by accident.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
<P>SINCE that time I have &s;ought for, and found many opportunities of inqui|ring into this matter, and of verifying what was then only probable conjecture? I have with great care examined a va|riety of &s;ubjects, and flatter my&s;elf that I have traced the di&s;ea&s;e to its true cau&s;e. The anatomy of the parts appeared to me as I &s;hall repre&s;ent it in the follow|ing pages, and all the deductions, and inferences which I &s;hall make from them, are &s;uch as appear to me to be na|tural, and true, and &s;uch as place the origin of this kind of rupture in a clear light.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e of which I am about to &s;peak, though &s;ometimes met with in adults, is mo&s;t certainly fir&s;t produced in early infancy; and, as I ap|prehend it to ari&s;e from the natural &s;tructure and di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome parts of the child while it is y&eacute;t unborn, I &s;hall begin with a &s;hort account of the&s;e parts during the re&s;idence of the foetus in the uterus.</P>
<P>THE parts which I mean, are, the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, the te&s;ticles, and epi|didymis, a part of the peritoneum, the aperture in the abdominal mu&s;cle, and the &s;crotum.</P>
<P>BY diligently ob&s;erving the &s;tructure, di&s;po&s;ition, and connexion of the&s;e in &s;o early a &s;tate as that of a foetus of five or &s;ix months; and by following them in their growth and progre&s;s, to that of
<PB N="8" REF="9">an infant; &s;uch information may (I think) be obtained, as will fully and clearly illu&s;trate the pre&s;ent matter.</P>
<P>THE te&s;ticles of all children are ori|ginally formed and lodged in the cavity of the belly; they remain there till the child is born, or till very near that time; and pa&s;s out from thence, each through an opening which leads into the groin; here they generally remain &s;ome little time; more or le&s;s in diffe|rent &s;ubjects, and at la&s;t de&s;cend into the &s;crotum, where they are &s;u&s;pended partly by their own ve&s;&s;els, and partly by the general attachment and connexion of the membranes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which include them. The di&s;po&s;ition of the te&s;ticle, and of its appendix the epididymis, while they remain in the abdomen of a foetus, their connexion with each other, and with other parts, their progre&s;s toward the opening by which they pa&s;s out, their determination to that opening, and the &s;tructure and di&s;po&s;ition of the parts
<PB N="9" REF="10">appointed for their reception both imme|diate, and future, are circum&s;tances, which, if properly attended to, will lead us not only into a knowledge of the parts them&s;elves, but of other matters of no &s;mall con&s;equence in the animal oeconomy.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay that the te&s;ticles are lodged in the cavity of the abdomen, I mu&s;t de&s;ire not to be mi&s;under&s;tood, as if I meant to &s;ay that they were within the peritoneum; they certainly are not, but are within the cavity of the belly, in the &s;ame manner as the inte&s;tines, and &s;ome other parts are, which, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are behind the peritoneum; but they are &s;o loo&s;e, and &s;o dependent from a kind of &s;talk, formed by the in|&s;ertion of the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els into them, and project &s;o much into the cavity of the abdomen, as to &s;eem within it&mdash;and in one &s;en&s;e are &s;o.</P>
<P>THEIR &s;ituation is not &s;o very preci&s;e, as not to vary a little &s;ometimes; but
<PB N="10" REF="11">the mo&s;t frequent is &s;ome way below the kidney, pretty near parallel to the upper part of the urinary bladder as it is upheld by the urachus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and re&s;t|ing upon the p&s;oas mu&s;cle. The &s;per|matic ve&s;&s;els lie behind the peritoneum enveloped in the membrana cellularis, and the body of the te&s;ticle projecting into the abdomen is loo&s;e and move|able from that pedicle formed by the in&s;ertion of the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els into it; it is of an oblong figure, and its greate&s;t length is upward and down|ward: The epididymis lies &s;tretched out behind the te&s;ticle, in the &s;ame di|rection&mdash;that is upward and downward.</P>
<P>THE inferior part of each epididymis is extended downwards, and in&s;inuates it&s;elf into a &s;mall orifice toward the lower part of the belly, almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the aperture in the tendon of the abdominal mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>IF the te&s;ticle be held a&s;ide, and the epididymis be moderately &s;tretched, this
<PB N="11" REF="12">orifice will become very vi&s;ible, and the extremity of the epididymis will be &s;een entering into it.</P>
<P>BY this orifice I have &s;everal times, without force or breach, pa&s;&s;ed a very &s;mall probe into the groin; the probe always pa&s;&s;ed through the aperture in the tendon of the abdominal mu&s;cle, and upon dividing the &s;kin, &s;eemed to be co|vered by, or enveloped in, a &s;mall mem|branous pouch, or &s;acculus, made by a protru&s;ion of the peritoneum.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome I have traced this little &s;accu|lus through the opening in the mu&s;cle, (which it always pa&s;&s;ed) into the upper part of the groin, and always found it to be a continuation of that part of the peritoneum which lines the mu&s;cles of the abdomen.</P>
<P>THAT extremity of the epididymis, which pa&s;&s;es into the mouth of this little &s;acculus is attached, or adherent
<PB N="12" REF="13">to the in&s;ide of it, in &s;uch maner, that though the te&s;ticle is &s;o loo&s;e at the in&s;er|tion of the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els as to permit very free motion from &s;ide to &s;ide, yet if either it, or the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, be pul|led &s;trait upward, toward the kidney, this adhe&s;ion will be found to detain it from going higher, unle&s;s the epididymis breaks, which a &s;mall degree of force will effect, it being very tender.</P>
<P>WHILE the te&s;ticles continue in the abdomen they are always naked, that is, they are not enveloped in that loo&s;e bag in which they are con&s;tantly found when in the &s;crotum, called tunica vagi|nalis te&s;tis.</P>
<P>AS the foetus increa&s;es in &s;ize and advances towards maturity, the te&s;ti|cles proceed lower down, and approach nearer to the openings in the abdominal mu&s;cle; and if they have not pa&s;&s;ed out ju&s;t before the birth (which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e) the di&s;tention of the lungs and
<PB N="13" REF="14">thorax by the air, and the action of the mu&s;cles of re&s;piration, &s;oon pu&s;h them forth from the belly, through the mu&s;cle, into the groin.</P>
<P>THE &s;afe and certain pa&s;&s;age of the te&s;ticles from the abdomen into the &s;crotum, is a circum&s;tance of great con|&s;equence; and, like every other part of the animal oeconomy, is provided for, and executed with &s;uch order and beauty, as to be&s;peak its great director.</P>
<P>I HAVE already taken notice, that on each &s;ide, of the lower part, of the in|&s;ide of the cavity of the belly, was a &s;mall opening; that in many &s;ubjects I could, without force or breach, pa&s;s a &s;mall probe, by means of this orifice, through the aperture in the tendon of the abdominal mu&s;cle; and that the probe, when thus pa&s;&s;ed, appeared to be enveloped in a very &s;mall membranous &s;acculus, formed by a production of the peritoneum.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
<P>BY this means a proper and convenient receptacle for the te&s;ticle is provided, and kept ready for it in due time.</P>
<P>IN mo&s;t of the foetus's which I have examined, it has appeared to me that the&s;e little &s;acculi were parts originally formed; but whether it is con&s;tantly and invariably &s;o, I will not pretend to &s;ay: Nor indeed is it of much con&s;e|quence to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, whether they are con&s;tantly &s;o, or not; for the event will be exactly the &s;ame, whether &s;acculi are formed by a production of the peritoneum pa&s;&s;ing through the tendinous aperture in the abdominal mu&s;cle, and placed ready to receive the te&s;ticle when it &s;hall be pu&s;hed through; or whether this tendinous opening is loo&s;ely covered by a membrane, &s;o very dilatable, as to give way to any impul&s;e, and pa&s;s out before the body which is pu&s;hed again&s;t it.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="16">
<P>IN either ca&s;e the te&s;ticle, as &s;oon as it has pa&s;&s;ed the opening in the mu&s;cle, will be found inveloped in a &s;acculus, formed by a production of the perito|neum, the upper part of which &s;acculus pa&s;&s;es through the mu&s;cle, and commu|nicates with the cavity of the abdomen by an orifice, patent, and vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>THIS the mere examination of the foe|tus makes to appear highly probable; but its truth is, I think, proved incon|te&s;tably (at lea&s;t with regard to the <HI>effect</HI>) by the following facts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the Te&s;ticles of almo&s;t all Children, though originally formed and lodged within the belly, yet &s;ooner or later after their birth, are found either in the groin, or in the &s;crotum; that is, they are found on the out&s;ide of the abdominal mu&s;cle.</ITEM>
<PB N="16" REF="17">
<ITEM>2. THAT the &s;crotum has no com|munication with the cavity of the abdomen, but through the mouths or entrances of the membranous &s;acculi in which the te&s;ticles are included.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT when the te&s;ticles are got into the groin, or &s;crotum, by hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through the aperture in the tendon of the abdominal mu&s;|cle, they are always found envelop|ed in a loo&s;e membranous bag, in which they were not contained while they were within the belly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT the entrances from the ab|domen into the&s;e &s;acculi containing the te&s;ticles, are generally to be &s;een open in a new born child. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THAT by laying the&s;e &s;acculi open, the te&s;ticles are found within them
<PB N="17" REF="18">naked;&mdash;that is, they are found in the &s;ame &s;tate with regard to co|vering as they were in, while with|in the cavity of the belly.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THIS is the &s;tate of the te&s;ticle when it is got into the &s;crotum, the place ap|pointed for its re&s;idence; and, le&s;t it &s;hould deviate from the right path, and by not pa&s;&s;ing through the aperture in the mu&s;cle, be detained within the ca|vity of the belly, that portion of the epi|didymis which precedes it in its pa&s;&s;age toward the abdominal opening, in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the orifice which leads to the &s;acculus appointed for its reception; by this means determining the pa&s;&s;age of the te&s;ticle, and preventing its deviation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This mu&s;t be under&s;tood as a de&s;cription of the ap|pearance the&s;e parts make at fir&s;t view: for both the epididymis and te&s;ticle are truly behind the peritoneum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is true, that in this, as well as every other part of the animal frame, the general laws of nature are &s;ometimes interrupted by accident, and mal-for|mations
<PB N="18" REF="19">are produced; but, in general, this is the proce&s;s, and this the appear|ance.</P>
<P>THE bag, which contains the te&s;ticle when in the groin, is loo&s;e and large, <HI>compared to the &s;ize</HI> of the <HI>te&s;tis;</HI> it is of a globular figure, is covered on its out|&s;ide by a cellular &s;ub&s;tance, and commu|nicates with the cavity of the belly by <HI>pa&s;&s;ing through the oblique</HI> mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>IF the te&s;ticles remain any time in the groin, (a thing not very unfrequent) the communication between the &s;acculi and the belly continues open all that time, at lea&s;t I have always found it &s;o in all tho&s;e whom I have examined.</P>
<P>WHEN the te&s;ticles are got below the groin into the &s;crotum, the &s;acculi which contain them a&s;&s;ume a pyriform kind of figure, having their large&s;t end lowe&s;t; they are connected with the membranes of the &s;crotum by means of the common
<PB N="19" REF="20">cellular &s;tructure, but &s;o very loo&s;ely in young &s;ubjects as to be &s;eparable with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THEY &s;till for &s;ome little time con|tinue to communicate with the cavity of the belly, by a large orifice capable in a mature foetus, or in a child newly born, of admitting a common crow-quill. This the eye-&s;ight, the pa&s;&s;age of a probe, or the de&s;cent of a fluid poured upon the mouth of the opening, will prove to the &s;atisfaction of any inquirer; and if the &s;ac|culus be now laid open, either from its bottom upward into the belly, or from its orifice within the belly downward, the mo&s;t clear and convincing proof will ap|pear, that the membrane which con&s;ti|tutes the in&s;ide of it is a production of, or a continuation from, that part of the peritoneum which lines the abdominal mu&s;cles, and covers the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">If this is doubted by any who have no immediate opportunity of examining it, I can &s;hew it to them in more than one &s;ubject, which I keep by me.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="21">
<P>UPON this divi&s;ion of the facculus it will al&s;o appear, that the te&s;ticle and epi|didymis within it have no other cover|ing than what they brought out from the abdomen, and that notwith&s;tanding they are protruded into, and apparently contained within the &s;acculus, yet they &s;till are (as they were originally) behind the peritoneum.</P>
<P>WHETHER it be by the weight of the te&s;ticle now become pendulous from the &s;permatic chord, or from the action of the abdominal mu&s;cles, or from what other cau&s;e, I know not; but &s;oon after the te&s;ticles are got fairly into the &s;cro|tum, the orifices and pa&s;&s;ages to the&s;e &s;acculi are clo&s;ed, and obliterated in &s;uch manner, that neither a probe, nor a fluid will now pa&s;s from the belly into them, nor from them into the belly.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age of communication be|comes clo&s;e &s;ome way above the epidi|dymis,
<PB N="21" REF="22">and the bag by this means forms a cavity much larger than the te&s;ticle, which is loo&s;ely included in it, and kept moi&s;t by a fine lymph con&s;tantly found there.</P>
<P>THE time at which this communica|tion is &s;topt, by the pa&s;&s;age being &s;hut, is uncertain and various; for though it mo&s;t frequently happens &s;oon after the te&s;ticles are got into the &s;crotum, yet it is not con&s;tantly &s;o; I have &s;een them open at four years old; and in an adult; and others have &s;een them open at a time between the&s;e: but whenever they do clo&s;e, they form tho&s;e bags which are then called the tunica vaginales te&s;|tium, from or to who&s;e cavity there is no longer any pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THUS it plainly appears, that what in the foetus was the little &s;acculus for the reception of the te&s;ticle, and what was the loo&s;e bag which contained it while it &s;taid in the groin, (during all which
<PB N="22" REF="23">time there was a free communication with the cavity of the belly) does, by the clo&s;ing and obliteration of that com|munication, become the tunica vagina|lis te&s;tis, and con&s;equently that the tu|nica vaginalis te&s;tis is a production of the peritoneum; and that the cellular membrane which envelopes the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els behind the peritoneum, by being gradually &s;tretched and lengthened as the child grows, becomes the tunica va|ginalis of the chord.</P>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate and progre&s;s of the&s;e parts from the foetus to the next &s;tage beyond early infancy; after which they undergo little or no alteration, which has any connexion with my pre&s;ent &s;ubject: but from their &s;tate in a foetus, from the alteration they undergo, and the progre&s;s they make, from conception to infancy, the di&s;ea&s;e contained in the Title may, I think, be clearly and &s;atisfactorily ac|counted for.</P>

<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is that kind of rupture, in which the portion of inte&s;tine or omentum which has pa&s;|&s;ed out from the belly, is found in the &s;ame bag, and in contact with the naked te&s;ticle; in contradi&s;tinction from the more frequent &s;pecies of inte&s;tinal or omental rupture, in which the parts fallen from the belly are contained in what is called a hernial &s;ac, who&s;e cavity is per|fectly di&s;tinct from, and has no commu|nication with, that in which the te&s;ticle is included called tunica vaginalis te&s;tis.</P>

<P>IN a natural &s;tate, and according to the mo&s;t u&s;ual cour&s;e, the openings or mouths of the&s;e &s;acculi become clo&s;e, and the pa&s;&s;ages obliterated, &s;oon after the te&s;ticles get into the &s;crotum; the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis is thus formed, and all communication with the belly pre|vented; but if a piece of gut or caul has &s;lipped in with, or ju&s;t after the te&s;|ticle, the opening cannot clo&s;e; the tuni|ca vaginalis te&s;tis cannot be properly formed, but the inte&s;tine, te&s;ticle and omentum mu&s;t be all together, in imme|diate contact with each other within this &s;acculus, who&s;e mouth mu&s;t &s;till remain open to the abdomen.</P>
<P>AND, as I have already taken notice, that the mouths of the&s;e &s;acculi always remain open while the te&s;ticle continues in the groin, a much longer time is by this means furni&s;hed in many &s;ubjects for this accident to happen in; not to mention again, that in &s;ome children
<PB N="26" REF="27">they do not clo&s;e till the te&s;ticles have been a great while in the &s;crotum, and that they have been found open in adults.</P>
<P>WHOEVER has a clear idea of the &s;tate of the&s;e parts, mu&s;t &s;ee, that what|ever pa&s;&s;es into the&s;e &s;acculi while they remain open, let the &s;ubject's age be what it may, mu&s;t be in the &s;ame ca|vity, and in contact with the naked te&s;ticle; and though the pa&s;&s;age from the belly will become clo&s;e and be obli|terated, if the parts which have fallen into it are returned back, and kept up by proper bandage; yet if they are not re|turned into the belly, or not kept there when returned, the pa&s;&s;age can never clo&s;e, and the hernia mu&s;t for ever re|main; and, while it does remain, will nece&s;&s;arily be of the kind mentioned in the Title.</P>
<P>FOR though this is a di&s;ea&s;e produced by &s;uch a &s;tate of parts as is peculiar to
<PB N="27" REF="28">an infant, and which a &s;mall &s;pace of time makes &s;uch an alteration in, as to prevent its happening after that &s;tate of infancy, yet if it is not taken proper care of when it has happened, it will mo&s;t probably continue during the life of the patient; and that therefore it mu&s;t &s;ometimes be found in adults.&mdash;A ca&s;e, which I am convinced, happens much oftner than is &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>THE more I have thought of this matter, the more I am convinced of the truth of what I have &s;aid in the pre|ceding pages; even accidents and mal|formations, which prevent the u&s;ual and regular proce&s;s, contribute to elucidate the &s;ubject; and though they are devia|tions from the natural cour&s;e, yet help to inform us what that would be, if it had not been prevented. A truth, which will appear in two of the following ca&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>J. GOODCHILD, a man who had been ruptured from his infancy, was brought into St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital labouring under &s;uch &s;ymptoms from &s;tricture, as to render the opera|tion immediately nece&s;&s;ary, but to leave little room to expect that it would be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE operation was performed in the u&s;ual manner, but upon returning the inte&s;tine into the abdomen, I found that the te&s;ticle was naked, and that the gut had been in contact with it.</P>
<P>THE man died the next day, and the parts were in &s;o gangrenous a &s;tate as not to permit any &s;atisfactory examina|tion of them; all that could be learnt was, that the inte&s;tine had been in the &s;ame cavity with the te&s;ticle, and that
<PB N="29" REF="30">the &s;ac containing them was open to the abdomen; this was all that appear|ed in this &s;ubject, which, though it did not give me much &s;atisfaction in pre&s;ent, determined me to examine more clo&s;ely &s;uch ca&s;es in future.</P>
<P>March 23, 1756. WILLIAM PEARCE, a healthy &s;tout man, twenty-five years old, was brought into St. Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, complaining of a painful &s;wel|ling in his right groin, a &s;light degree of nau&s;ea, and an incapacity of di&s;charging any thing by &s;tool.</P>
<P>THESE complaints had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted three days, when he was taken into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the groin on the right &s;ide was a &s;welling, about the &s;ize of a middling le|mon, of an oblong figure; its greate&s;t length being tran&s;ver&s;e or &s;tretching from the pubis to the ilium, the tumor &s;eemed pretty full, was con&s;tantly painful in &s;ome degree, but much more &s;o upon being handled.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<P>THE &s;crotum on this &s;ide was defi|cient from his birth, and neither te&s;ticle nor &s;permatic proce&s;s could be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE man being a&s;ked, &s;aid, that he had had more or le&s;s of this &s;welling ever &s;ince he could remember; that he had never been &s;en&s;ible of any te&s;ticle on that &s;ide, and that he had formerly wore a bandage, but could not endure the pain it gave him.</P>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms being &s;uch as indicated a &s;tricture on &s;ome part of the inte&s;tinal canal, I endeavoured to return the con|tents of the &s;welling into the belly, but could not &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>As his pain was not very great, ex|cept when the part was handled; as he had but little fever, and neither vomit|ing nor hiccup, I ordered him to be largely bled, to have a purging gly&s;ter,
<PB N="31" REF="32">to cover the tumor with a &s;oft pultice, and to keep in bed.</P>
<P>THE next day the &s;welling &s;eemed rather abated, and le&s;s ten&s;e; his &s;ickne&s;s continued, but without any vomiting; he was perfectly ea&s;y in his belly, but had di&s;charged nothing by &s;tool.</P>
<P>I TRIED again to return the parts, but ineffectually; and, as the handling them was exce&s;&s;ively painful to him, I ordered him to be again bled, to repeat his gly&s;ter and pultice, and to take frequently two or three &s;poonfuls of a purging mixture, but &s;till could obtain no &s;tool; and, on the third day, his pain being much in|crea&s;ed, with the addition of hiccup and vomiting, I endeavoured to relieve him by the operation.</P>
<P>I BEGAN the inci&s;ion in the u&s;ual place, and continued it as low as the tumor reached.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="33">
<P>UPON the divi&s;ion of the &s;kin and membrana adipo&s;a, a firm membranous bag or &s;acculus came into view; this I took to be the hernial &s;ac; but, upon laying it open, I found that it contained a quantity of bloody &s;erum, a piece of omentum, a portion of inte&s;tine, and the te&s;ticle.</P>
<P>THE te&s;ticle and its epididymis were both naked; that is, they were not en|veloped in a tunica vaginalis, and the bag which contained all the&s;e parts was open at its upper part into the cavity of the abdomen by a narrow neck, which neck pa&s;&s;ed through the aperture in the obliquns de&s;cendens mu&s;cle, by the tendon of which that &s;tricture was made on the inte&s;tine which produced the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e neither the inte&s;tine nor the te&s;ticle were got below the groin, there being no &s;crotum on that &s;ide; but
<PB N="33" REF="34">the &s;ac which contained the te&s;ticle, inte&s;tine and omentum, was plainly that &s;acculus which was originally de|&s;igned to become the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis; its communication with the belly, the &s;tate of the te&s;ticle and epididymis, and the date of the rupture, all prove this: The di&s;ea&s;e was from early infancy, the te&s;ticle and epididymis had no co|vering but their proper and immediate coat; the &s;acculus communicated with the cavity of the belly, and the te&s;ticle was connected with its internal and lower part.</P>
<P>As the &s;crotum was deficient on that &s;ide, the te&s;ticle could never de&s;cend &s;o as to become pendulous, and thereby give the tunica vaginalis an opportunity of becoming clo&s;e at its upper part; and a piece of inte&s;tine having pa&s;&s;ed in, was another rea&s;on why the orifice could not contract it&s;elf; the te&s;ticle always re|maining ju&s;t on this &s;ide the abdominal mu&s;cle, in the groin, was the rea&s;on
<PB N="34" REF="35">why he never could keep the inte&s;tine within the belly by a tru&s;s, the pad or bol&s;ter of which mu&s;t pre&s;s on the te&s;tis in &s;uch manner as to give great pain.</P>
<P>IN July la&s;t, J. Leak, a man about thirty-five, was brought into St. Bartho|lomew's Ho&s;pital, with all the &s;ymp|toms and all the appearances of a &s;tran|gulated inte&s;tine.</P>
<P>THE gentleman under who&s;e care he had been, had u&s;ed all proper means to relieve him, and had endeavoured to re|turn the parts, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and there was nothing left for me to do, but to perform the operation, which I did immediately. The &s;welling, which was confined to the groin, was more oblong than u&s;ual, &s;tretching from the pubis to the ilium, and had that inequality to the touch as implied a pretty large portion of omentum to be contained in it.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="36">
<P>UPON making the inci&s;ion, I ob&s;erved that the hernial &s;ac was not enveloped by any tunica vaginalis, but that it lay immediately under the adipo&s;e mem|brane, and had none of tho&s;e fine tendi|nous bands or expan&s;ions on its out&s;ide, which are generally &s;een on the out&s;ide of a common hernial &s;ac.</P>
<P>THE &s;ac being laid open, the &s;tricture divided, and the parts (which were a large portion of omentum, and a &s;mall one of inte&s;tine) returned, the te&s;ticle was found ju&s;t within the aperture in the tendon of the abdominal mu&s;cle, in the cavity of the belly; it was naked, and a portion of the epididymis was adherent to the upper part of the neck of that &s;ac, which had contained the gut and caul ju&s;t at its pa&s;&s;age through the tendon; the &s;permatic chord was &s;o &s;hort, as not to permit the de&s;cent of the te&s;ticle any lower.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<P>IN this ca&s;e, the te&s;ticle not being ca|pable of pa&s;&s;ing through the aperture in the mu&s;cle, the omentum and inte&s;tine were pu&s;hed out in its &s;tead, and had di|lated that &s;acculus (which, if the te&s;ticle had taken its natural cour&s;e, would have formed its tunica vaginalis) into a hernial &s;ac, of &s;ize capable of containing a large portion of caul, and &s;ome inte&s;tine. This al&s;o was a rupture from early infancy, but the patient, not knowing what it was, had neglected it.</P>
<P>SOON after this I had an opportunity of looking into the body of a youth about fif|teen years old, who died of another di&s;ea&s;e; but had been ruptured from his birth.</P>
<P>IN a &s;acculus, which pa&s;&s;ed through the opening in the abdominal mu&s;cle, were contained a large portion of the in|te&s;tine ilium, and a &s;mall piece of the co|lon, in contact with the naked te&s;ticle; the te&s;ticle had no other covering than
<PB N="37" REF="38">its proper tunica albuginea, and the epidi|dymis was united with the po&s;terior part of the &s;ac: The &s;ac lay immediately under the membrana adipo&s;a, and had no covering from the tunica vaginalis of the chord.</P>
<P>THIS is preci&s;ely that ca&s;e, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by the breach both of the peritoneum, and of the &s;ep|tum between the two tunicae vaginales; but which, I flatter my&s;elf, that I have proved in the foregoing pages, to be pro|duced in another manner: certain I am, that the anatomy of the parts, both na|tural and di&s;ea&s;ed, give no countenance or &s;upport to the former opinion; and, if I am not hindered by prejudice and partiality from judging properly, the lat|ter appears to me to have all the &s;upport from it which it can give.</P>
<P>BY con&s;idering what has been &s;aid it will appear, that in this particular kind of hernia the bag containing the parts which have pa&s;&s;ed out from the abdo|men,
<PB N="38" REF="39">although it be really a production of the peritoneum, and pa&s;&s;es through the tendon of the oblique mu&s;cle, yet is not what is commonly meant by the term a hernial &s;ac; but is that &s;acculus, which, if the inte&s;tine had not been pu&s;hed into it, would, by clo&s;ing at its upper part, have become the tunica va|ginalis te&s;tis.</P>
<P>THAT this &s;acculus cannot be includ|ed in the tunica vaginalis of the chord, no more than the &s;ac of the mo&s;t frequent &s;pecies of hydrocele is, it being the &s;ame bag in one ca&s;e as in the other, with this difference only, that in the latter it is clo&s;e at top, and does not communicate with the belly; in the former it is open, and does communicate.</P>
<P>THAT the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis be|ing open at its upper part to the cavity of the belly, the te&s;ticle cannot be enve|loped in it in the u&s;ual manner, but mu&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="40">be found naked in the &s;ame common ca|vity with the inte&s;tine.</P>
<P>WHEREAS in the common hernia, the tunica vaginalis of the chord envelopes the &s;ac, the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els lie behind it, and the te&s;ticle is included in a di&s;tinct cavity formed by the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis.</P>
<P>THE former ca&s;e happens while the pa&s;&s;age for the te&s;ticle is open, and con|&s;equently there can be no hernial &s;ac in the u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the term, but the tu|nica vaginalis te&s;tis is thus converted into one.</P>
<P>THE latter (or common hernia) hap|pening after this pa&s;&s;age is obliterated, another portion of the peritoneum is thru&s;t before the inte&s;tine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> through the tendon of the mu&s;cle into the groin or &s;crotum, thus con&s;tituting a hernial &s;ac; which &s;ac forms a cavity perfectly di&s;tinct from that of the tunica vagina|lis te&s;tis, lies anterior to the &s;permatic
<PB N="40" REF="41">chord, and is inveloped in the tunica va|ginalis thereof.</P>
<P>BY con&s;idering the &s;tate of the&s;e parts in an infant, it will al&s;o appear, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary it is to be &s;ure of the &s;ituation of the te&s;ticle before the pad of a tru&s;s is applied to re&s;train a rupture; &s;ince if the te&s;ticle is &s;till in the groin, it mu&s;t not only be brui&s;ed and hurt by the pre&s;&s;ure, but will al&s;o be prevented from de&s;cend|ing; whereas if it be got below the groin, the bandage will not only keep up the in|te&s;tine, but contribute al&s;o to the clo&s;ing of the tunica vaginalis te&s;tis; the &s;ame ap|plication thus becoming a cure in one ca&s;e, and adding to the di&s;ea&s;e in the other.</P>
<P>HENCE al&s;o the &s;udden appearance, and &s;ometimes as &s;udden di&s;&s;ipation of tumors, either flatulent or watery, which are frequently &s;een about the &s;permatic chord, &s;crotum and te&s;ticles of young in|fants, may be accounted for.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="42">
<P>AND hence al&s;o may be &s;een the rea&s;on, why by far the greater number of children, who are ruptured in their early infancy, are males.</P>
