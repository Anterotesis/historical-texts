<P><HI>MY</HI> de&s;ign is to exhibit, in as conci&s;e a form as po&s;&s;ible, a view of all that has been di&s;covered, &s;o far as I know, concerning the means of pre&s;erving the health of Seamen. Be&s;ides what I have learned from my own ob&s;ervation, and from the conver&s;ation of naval Officers and men of the medical profe&s;&s;ion, a great part of what is here advanced has been extracted from Authors, and par|ticularly from the works of Dr. Lind, and Capt. Cooke.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is to Dr. Lind we are indebted for the mo&s;t accurate, ingenious, and original ob&s;er|vations on this &s;ubject, and Sir John Pringle has given an excellent compendium of Capt. Cooke's improvements on his elegant di&s;cour&s;e before the Royal Society.</NOTE> As the ob&s;ervations on this important &s;ubject lie di&s;per&s;ed in voluminous writings, to which officers have &s;eldom time or opportunity to re&s;ort, I thought it would be a u&s;eful and acceptable undertaking to collect them into a &s;mall compa&s;s, together with &s;uch new remarks as have occurred to others as well as my&s;elf, particularly re&s;pecting this &s;tation.</P>
<P>More may be done towards the pre&s;ervation of the health and lives of &s;eamen than is commonly imagined, and it is plainly a matter not only of humanity and duty, but of intere&s;t and policy. The forming of a &s;eaman depends upon a long habit of life, and a practical education, as it were, from an early period of life; &s;o that if our &s;tock of mariners were exhau&s;ted, or dimini&s;hed, neither trea&s;ure nor any other means could repair the le&s;s. In this view, as well as from the peculiar dependence of Britain upon her navy, this order of men is truly ine&s;timable. Moreover, con&s;idering man merely as a commodity in an oeconomi|cal and political view, independently of moral con&s;iderations, it could be made clear that their health and lives might be pre&s;erved at infinitely le&s;s expence and trouble than what are nece&s;&s;ary to repair the ravage of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>That the health of &s;hips companies depends upon means within our power, is &s;trongly evinced by this; that &s;hips in the &s;ame &s;ituation of &s;ervice enjoy very different degrees of health. It cannot e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that in this, and every other fleet, there are &s;hips with the &s;ame complement of men, which have been the &s;ame length of time at &s;ea, and have been victualled and watered in the &s;ame manner, &s;ome of which are extremely &s;ickly while others are free from di&s;ea&s;e. It is to be inferred from this, that the health of &s;hips companies depends in a great mea&s;ure upon circum&s;tances within the power of officers, and upon them
<PB N="II" REF="7">much more than the medical branch, the health of the men depends, in as much as prevention is better than cure, and the art of phy&s;ic is at best but fallible.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It is not meant by this to in&s;inuate that every commander is ab&s;olutely accountable for the health of his &s;hip's company, and cen&s;urable when they are &s;ickly, for this may depend on his predece&s;&s;or, or a &s;tubborn infection may have prevailed from the original fitting and manning which he may not have &s;uperintended.</NOTE>It is prevention only that is the &s;ubject of this little treati&s;e, which is therefore addre&s;&s;ed to commanders, in who&s;e hands alone the means of it are, &s;ince it de|pends on matters of police which they only can enforce, and I am well per&s;uaded that a certain degree of attention on their part would almo&s;t entirely extirpate di&s;ea&s;e from the navy.</P>
<P>Several obvious and well-known particulars will be found on the peru&s;al of the following pages, which it may be thought &s;uperfluous to mention. But it was my intention to omit nothing of con&s;equence which I have heard of, or ob|&s;erved as a matter of a&s;certained utility, and I believe the mo&s;t experienced will find either &s;omething new, or what they had not before &s;ufficiently attended to. Although the de&s;ign of this work is to be exten&s;ively u&s;eful, yet my trouble would be compen&s;ated, &s;hould it prove the means of health and comfort even to a &s;ingle &s;hip's company Nay, I &s;hould not repent my labour, could I enjoy the con&s;cious certainty of its having &s;aved the life of one brave and good man.</P>

<HEAD>MEANS OF PRESERVING THE HEALTH OF SEAMEN.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who live at &s;ea are in a certain degree exempt from &s;ome of the di&s;ea&s;es to which a life on land is &s;ubject, but there are more fatal di&s;ea&s;es incident to the former than the latter. The &s;uperior purity of the air at &s;ea is more than counter balanced by the artificial means of propagating di&s;ea&s;e on board of a &s;hip. But as the air is &s;o pure at &s;ea, and as the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e peculiar to a &s;ea-faring life are chargeable ra|ther to the mi&s;management of men, than to the unavoidable cour&s;e of nature, we are encouraged to exert our attention in endeavouring to era|dicate them.</P>
<P>The only very fatal di&s;ea&s;es incident to &s;eamen are fevers, fluxes, and the &s;curvy.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. OF FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a fever is very prevalent in a &s;hip, it is almo&s;t always infec|tious, and this infection has either been vi&s;ibly introduced into her from without, by the per&s;ons or clothes of men, or it has ari&s;en from cau&s;es exi&s;ting within the &s;hip her&s;elf. The means of prevention &s;hould have regard to both the&s;e.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>1.</HI> Means of preventing the Introduction of Infection.</HEAD>
<P>The introduction of infection is prevented by great caution in admitting men who come from jails, guard&s;hips, tenders, captured ve&s;&s;els, and in general tho&s;e who are remarkably ragged and dirty, or who have come from &s;hips or other places where the fever is known to have prevailed.</P>
<P>The mode of manning the navy by pre&s;&s;ing is, I &s;uppo&s;e, unavoidable,
<PB N="2" REF="9" MS="y">but it is one of the greate&s;t means of &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e. As this cannot be remedied, and as the exigency of the &s;ervice in time of war does not permit that per&s;ons of any de&s;cription be excluded, it becomes highly nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the effects of the contagion that may adhere to them. This is done by &s;tripping and wa&s;hing their bodies, by cutting off their hair, and de&s;troying all their clothes, before they are allowed to mix with the &s;hip's company in which they are going to enter. Tho&s;e who have &s;trictly put tho&s;e methods in practice know how effectual and in|fallible they are, and exact attention is nece&s;&s;ary, as a &s;ingle infected man, or any part of his cloathing, will &s;pread &s;ickne&s;s through a whole &s;hip's company. Men in health who are remarkably dirty, or that have been in the company of tho&s;e who have been affected with an infectious fever, will communicate di&s;ea&s;e as much as the &s;ick them&s;elves, and the jail di&s;|temper has been known to proceed from pri&s;oners who were not them|&s;elves affected by it. When we reflect what havoc an infectious fever &s;ometimes makes in a &s;hip, it will appear how infinitely important it is to attend exactly to this circum&s;tance; for if the cau&s;e of the &s;ickline&s;s of particular &s;hips be traced to its &s;ource, it will generally be found to have ari&s;en from taking in infected men at Spithead, or wherever el&s;e the &s;hip's company may have been compleated.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> Means of preventing the Production of Infection.</HEAD>
<P>Fevers of an infectious nature are not always produced by the introduc|tion of any evident cau&s;es of contagion, but the infection &s;eems frequently to ari&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly, as it were, being either actually generated, or being excited or rendered noxious, when it would otherwi&s;e have been lain dor|mant and inactive. The means of preventing this &s;ort of infection in a &s;hip are chiefly fre&s;h air and cleanline&s;s, &s;helter from cold and wet, and keeping the &s;hip from being too much crouded. Nature has wi&s;ely con|trived our in&s;tincts for avoiding filth, by rendering tho&s;e places loath&s;ome to the &s;en&s;es which have been long crouded with numbers of people, and by making it offen&s;ive both to our&s;elves and others to keep the &s;ame cloathes long in contact with the body. It is this, joined to a narrow and confined &s;ituation, that gives ri&s;e to the jail di&s;temper, and fevers of a
<PB N="3" REF="10" MS="y">like kind that originate in ho&s;pitals and &s;hips where &s;imilar circum&s;tances concur.</P>
<P>The means that have been found mo&s;t effectual for keeping men clean, and preventing them from neglecting their per&s;ons, from poverty, &s;loven|line&s;s, or par&s;imony, have been,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;ee that all that enter be provided with a proper change of linen, and that a weekly review be made to &s;ee that the men are clean. Every man &s;hould be made an&s;werable for a certain nece&s;&s;ary quantity of &s;lops, and it has been the practice of &s;ome of our mo&s;t able and intelligent Com|manders to form the &s;hip's company into divi&s;ions and &s;quads, the weekly in&s;pection of who&s;e per&s;ons and clothing is a&s;&s;igned to as many re&s;pective officers.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was an article in the in&s;tructions of the late Commander in Chief in America, that the &s;hip's company &s;hould be divided into as many divi&s;ions as there were Lieutenants, and the&s;e di|vided into &s;quads, with a mid&s;hipman appointed to each, who &s;hould be re&s;pectively re&s;pon&s;ible for the good order and di&s;cipline of the men.</NOTE> This would both prevent the unhealthine&s;s ari&s;ing from na&s;ti|ne&s;s, and dimini&s;h the means of drunkenne&s;s procured by di&s;po&s;ing of &s;lops. A review of this kind would al&s;o prevent &s;eamen from allowing their wet and dirty cloathes to lie in a che&s;t or corner till they are cor|rupted, and become a &s;ource of na&s;tine&s;s and di&s;ea&s;e. It will appear clearly to any one who reflects well on the &s;ubject, that a regulation of this kind is as nece&s;&s;ary as any other piece of duty, and it perhaps de&s;erves to be made an article of the public in&s;tructions, in&s;tead of being left to the di&s;|cretion of officers. There are &s;hips that allow the men a day in the week for wa&s;hing their cloathes, and I have ob&s;erved the be&s;t effects from it. The trouble that is taken in attending to neatne&s;s, order, and &s;obriety, never fails to be rewarded with a healthy &s;hip's company, to the great &s;a|tisfaction and private comfort of the Commander, and the un&s;peakable advantage of the public &s;ervice. It is of con&s;equence that the Pur&s;er &s;hould lay in a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;lops, &s;uited to the climate for which the &s;hip is de&s;tined, in order that there may be a &s;upply after &s;he has been for &s;ome time from home upon a di&s;tant &s;tation.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">It would tend greatly to the health of &s;eamen to have a navy uniform e&s;tabli&s;hed, that they might always have in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and be accountable for a certain quantity of decent appa|rel, &s;ubject to the regular in&s;pection of their officers.</NOTE></ITEM>
<PB N="4" REF="11" MS="y">
<ITEM>2. To air and exerci&s;e the men above decks, when their duty does not lead them to do &s;o, and to air their hammocks by expo&s;ing them upon deck, e&s;pecially after the ports have been long &s;hut in con&s;equence of bad weather. The hammocks cannot be thoroughly aired unle&s;s they are unla&s;hed. This cannot with any convenience be done daily in a man of war, but it might be done from time to time by the different divi&s;ions in rotation, and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of &s;crubbing and wa&s;hing. When they come to be lain upon after the&s;e operations, the &s;ame agreeable &s;en|&s;ation is produced that one experiences from a change of linen, which highly conduces to health and plea&s;ure, like all other natural and mode|rate gratifications.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To keep the ports open as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to have &s;cuttles in them for the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air. This is extremely u&s;eful every where, but particularly in the We&s;t-Indies. It &s;hould never be neglected to cut &s;cuttles in the &s;ides of frigates de&s;tined for this &s;tation, for otherwi&s;e the heat between decks is almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To fumigate frequently with fires of wood &s;prinkled with pitch or ro&s;in, carried about between decks in a pot or moveable grate, or in a tub with &s;not in it when the ports can be opened; or, if the weather will not admit of this, to burn gun-powder wetted with vinegar. The &s;ick berth &s;hould be occa&s;ionally wa&s;hed all over with vinegar. The good effects of fire and &s;moke is &s;trongly evinced by this, that when it was the cu&s;tom for frigates to have their kitchens between decks they were remarkably more healthy than they are now that they have them under the foreca&s;tle, where the heat and &s;moke are di&s;&s;ipated without being diffu&s;ed through the &s;hip, and cau&s;ing a draught of air upwards as formerly, not to &s;peak of the benefit and comfort ari&s;ing from having a large fire round which men may a&s;&s;emble and warm and dry them&s;elves in a &s;heltered place. I leave it to tho&s;e who pre&s;ide in the con&s;truction of the navy how far an al|teration in this re&s;pect would be advi&s;eable in fitting this cla&s;s of &s;hips.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. To wa&s;h and &s;crape all the decks frequently.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Howe gave it as part of his in&s;tructions to wa&s;h the upper decks every day, the lower decks twice a we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and the orlop once a week at lea&s;t.

<PB N="5" REF="12">unwhole&s;ome moi&s;ture, and care &s;hould be taken to do it in dry weather, if po&s;&s;ible, and as early in the day as convenient, that there may be time for it to dry. It is after wa&s;hing that fires are mo&s;t applicable and u&s;eful.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dryne&s;s is perhaps of as great con&s;equence as any one thing that can be named, for not only the complaints commonly called colds are more owing to wet than cold, but moi&s;ture is the means of producing or at lea&s;t exciting dangerous fevers and contributes greatly to the production of &s;curvy. It is ob&s;erved that new &s;hips are generally unhealthy. Whether this is owing to moi&s;ture merely as &s;uch, or to &s;omething &s;pecifically noxious in the exhalation of wood I will not take upon me to determine, but the fact is well a&s;certained. Wood is moi&s;t either by being u&s;ed in too recent a &s;tate or by being injudiciou&s;ly &s;tript of its bark and outer &s;urface when piled and expo&s;ed to the weather in yards.
<P>I owe this ob&s;ervation as well as many others in this treati&s;e to an officer who&s;e exten&s;ive merits and virtues in the great line of his country's &s;ervice places him above prai&s;e in a &s;ubject like this.</P></NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. To work ventilators, and to put down wind-&s;ails, as often, and for as long a time as po&s;&s;ible. This is more particularly nece&s;&s;ary in large &s;hips, where the ma&s;s of foul air is &s;o great, and &s;o remote from the ac|ce&s;s of the external air, that it cannot be thoroughly &s;wept off but by &s;uch contrivances. Under this head it may be recommended to keep the decks as clear as po&s;&s;ible from che&s;ts and other lumber which are in the way of &s;weeping and wa&s;hing, and prevent the free cour&s;e of the air.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. To berth the watches alternately, which at the &s;ame time pre&s;erves the trim of the &s;hip. By this arrangement men lie much cooler, and it is more agreeable in every re&s;pect, as well as more healthy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Though foul air and uncleanline&s;s are the chief cau&s;es that produce an infectious fever, yet exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, too much expo&s;ure to heat, cold, and wet, &s;canty or unwhole&s;ome food, bad water and intoxication con|tribute &s;everally to awaken the &s;eeds of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>3.</HI> Means of Eradicating Infection.</HEAD>
<P>It too frequently happens that from a neglect of the means that have been mentioned, an infectious fever comes to prevail, and when once it has gained ground adheres ob&s;tinately to a &s;hip, in &s;pite of cleanline&s;s, good air and diet, and all the other means that have been pre&s;cribed for
<PB N="6" REF="13">preventing infection. In this &s;ituation &s;ome mea&s;ures have been thought of for <HI>eradicating</HI> this &s;ubtle poi&s;on. The means that have been found mo&s;t effectual are,</P>
<P N="1">1. To keep the &s;ick &s;eparate from the &s;ound, and to cut off all inter|cour&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible, in order to prevent its progre&s;s. For this end it is nece&s;&s;ary to appropriate a &s;ick berth to contagious complaints, and not only to prevent the men in health from go&s;&s;iping about it, but to find out and &s;eparate &s;uch complaints as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, both to pre|vent them from being caught by others, and becau&s;e recent complaints are more manageable and curable. Tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is to &s;uper|intend the health of the &s;hip would find it for their ea&s;e and intere&s;t as well as duty, to walk over the different decks once a day or every other day in order to di&s;cover early tho&s;e who are taken ill.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has been mentioned before that the cloathes of men are as dan|gerous a vehicle of infection as their per&s;ons, and it &s;hould be made a &s;trict and invariable rule that in ca&s;e of death from Fever or Flux, every article of bedding and clothing about the body be thrown over-board along with it. Upon the &s;ame principle, in ca&s;e of recovery from either of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, as it &s;eldom can be afforded to de&s;troy the clothes and bedding, they &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible be &s;moked and then &s;crubbed or wa&s;hed before the men join their me&s;&s;es and return to duty, as their hammocks will frequently have occa&s;ion to come in contact with tho&s;e of the other men. If the trouble of all this be objected to, let us reflect for a moment how much more trouble&s;ome &s;ickne&s;s it&s;elf is, how noi&s;ome and di&s;agree|able, and what a clog it is to publick &s;ervice; not to mention the regard due to the &s;ufferings of the objects them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;ometimes adheres to the timbers for months and years together and can be eradicated only by a thorough fumigation. This cannot well be done but when the &s;hip is in &s;uch a &s;ituation that every per&s;on can be turned out in order that pots of charcoal and &s;ulphur may burn between decks while the &s;moke is confined by &s;hutting the hatches. An action with the enemy has been known to purge a &s;hip from infection.</P>
<P N="4">4. To per&s;evere more regularly and frequently in the u&s;e of fires, and in the practice of &s;craping and wa&s;hing the decks and beams, particularly
<PB N="7" REF="14" MS="y">in the &s;ick births where hot vinegar &s;hould be &s;prinkled twice a day on the beams planks and &s;ides. The &s;umes of pitch tar and other re&s;inous &s;ub|&s;tances has a more powerful effect than any other &s;moke, and be&s;ides what is thrown upon the fires, it would be u&s;eful to throw pitch upon a red hot iron, or to immer&s;e a loggerhead in a ve&s;&s;el where there is pitch or tar. It has an extremely good effect al&s;o to white-wa&s;h all the decks and beams with quicklime. But a complete &s;moking is the only radical and effectual remedy and the fooner it is applied the better, for the longer infection continues the more it accumulates.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that the numbers of &s;ick in a &s;hip are &s;o great that it is not po&s;&s;ible to take proper and effectual mea&s;ures for &s;topping the progre&s;s of di&s;ea&s;e. But when &s;he can be cleared of her &s;ick by &s;ending them to an ho&s;pital, no pains &s;hould be &s;pared to extirpate the remaining &s;eeds of infection. Let their clothing and bedding be &s;ent along with them: their hammocks, uten&s;ils, and whatever they leave behind, &s;hould be &s;moked, and either &s;crubbed or wa&s;hed before they are u&s;ed by other men, or mixed with the &s;hip's &s;tores: the decks, &s;ides, and beams of their berths &s;hould be well wa&s;hed, &s;craped, &s;moked and dried by fire, and finally white-wa&s;ned all over with quick-lime.</P>
<P>It may be proper to mention in this place that the orlop, and all be|low it, by being below water is more apt to become a receptacle of na&s;ti|ne&s;s, and by being le&s;s under the eye of the Captain and other officers, is more apt to be neglected. I think I have &s;een &s;ickline&s;s propagated and continued from this circum&s;tance when the quarter-deck and gun|decks have been kept &s;ufficiently clean. The well and the hold &s;hould al&s;o be attended to, and a grate with fire in it &s;hould be let down from time to time. When the hold has been long &s;hut, it becomes full of a deadly air, and the common method of trying it by a lighted candle is &s;o well known as hardly to need mentioning.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This bad air, however, is not productive of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, the only air that is really to be feared in this way being that which is fouled by the &s;tagnating effluvia of the living human body. The air of the hold which renders bilge water &s;o offen&s;ive is rather to be con&s;idered as di&s;agreoable than pernicious unle&s;s when &s;o &s;trong as to produce &s;uffocation.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>4.</HI> Means of Guarding again&s;t Infection.</HEAD>
<P><HI>La&s;tly.</HI> If an infection actually prevails, and one is unavoidably ex|po&s;ed to it, the be&s;t means to prevent its taking effect are, to live in a hearty and generous manner, particularly in the article of drink, but al|ways within the limits of intoxication. It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to avoid exce&s;s, irregularity and expo&s;ure, &s;uch as intoxication, fatigue, fa&s;ting, watching and getting wet. To the&s;e may be added certain affec|tions of the mind, &s;uch as care, grief and fear, which in like manner weaken the powers of life, and render the con&s;titution more acce&s;&s;ible to the a&s;&s;aults of di&s;ea&s;e. I have already mentioned &s;eparation as a principal means of &s;topping the progre&s;s of contagion, but tho&s;e who are under the nece&s;&s;ity of approaching the &s;ick &s;hould avoid clo&s;e contact and their breath, they &s;hould not go within their influence with an empty &s;tomach, and &s;hould &s;mell to vinegar and camphor when near them.</P>
<P>It is highly worth while here to ob&s;erve that the influence of infectious di&s;tempers does not extend &s;o far as is commonly imagined. It is now known for certain that the infection of the Plague does not extend above a few yards, and the &s;ame &s;eems to hold with regard to malignant fevers. This di&s;covery is very valuable by a&s;certaining the degree of ri&s;k, for when men imagined them&s;elves in the &s;ame danger when at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;eat of a particular di&s;ea&s;e, as if they had been in contact with the &s;ick, they expo&s;ed them&s;elves ra&s;hly and unnece&s;&s;arily to the in|fection.</P>
<P>All the preceding ob&s;ervations concerning infection are particularly ap|plicable to the fevers prevailing at &s;ea, which however are not &s;o frequent in this climate as in England.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is a remark which, &s;o far as I know, has not been made by any author, and till ob|&s;ervation convinced me of it I fancied the rever&s;e to be true. It is certain that there is &s;omething in the tropical climates aver&s;e to the production or continuation of infectious fevers. I have &s;een &s;o many in&s;tances of crouding and na&s;tine&s;s in &s;hips and ho&s;pitals without contagion being produced, and which in Europe would have excited it, or rendered it more malignant, that the fact is a&s;certained beyond a doubt. Farther, tho&s;e &s;hips which bring this infectious fever from Europe in general get rid of it &s;oon after coming to this climate, and nothing but the highe&s;t degree of neglect can revive it. This brought into my mind what is related of the Plague at Smyrna and other places; that it di&s;appears at the hotte&s;t part of the &s;ea&s;on, and it is a di&s;ea&s;e we never hear of in the Torrid Zone. It is very di&s;&s;icult to a&s;certain the cau&s;e of this, as every thing relating to infection is very ob&s;cure. We can conceive it to be owing to the greater degree of airine&s;s which the heat of the climate makes nece&s;&s;ary, or the employment of le&s;s woollen clothes; there may be &s;omething in the &s;tate of the body, particularly of its &s;urface, which di&s;po&s;es it le&s;s to produce or imbibe the poi&s;onous effluvia, or more probably the virulent matter is of &s;uch a degree of volatility as to be readily di&s;&s;ipated in a certain degree of heat.</NOTE> There are other &s;ources of fever only to
<PB N="9" REF="16">be met with on &s;hore, &s;uch as the neighbourhood of woods and mar&s;hes, the vapours of which produce intermitting and bilious fevers, and they de&s;erve attention here, as &s;ailors are occa&s;ionally expo&s;ed to them. The pre&s;ervatives again&s;t &s;uch fevers; be&s;ides temperance and the avoiding of cold, wet and fatigue, are cold bathing, good living, particularly in the article of drink, and the u&s;e of &s;ome bitter medicine, &s;uch as an infu&s;ion of Peruvian bark or chamomile flowers.</P>

<HEAD>II. OF FLUXES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few remarks to be made upon the&s;e, be&s;ides what have been delivered on fevers, the &s;ame rules being applicable in a great mea&s;ure to both. The flux &s;eems indeed frequently to be a kind of &s;ub|&s;titute for fevers, as it prevails mo&s;t in tho&s;e &s;hips that have brought from Europe an infectious fever. This cea&s;es upon coming into the country, and is &s;ucceeded by the dy&s;entery, which &s;eems to be the la&s;t effort of the contagion, modified into this form by the influence of the climate. It &s;eems at other times to be a &s;pontaneous di&s;ea&s;e as well as fever; for both will &s;ometimes ari&s;e in this climate at &s;ea without any &s;u&s;picion of infec|tion or a &s;pecific quality of the air, and merely from circum&s;tances of heat, cold, wet, fatigue, intemperance, &amp;c.</P>
<P>With regard to prevention, be&s;ides the rules of cleanline&s;s, dryne&s;s, &s;moking and airing, which are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent and root out fevers, attention &s;hould be paid that men upon fir&s;t coming to this climate be expo&s;ed as little as po&s;&s;ible to &s;udden changes of heat and cold, or to hard labour, e&s;pecially in the night air, or in rainy weather. As it is the di&s;|ea&s;e mo&s;t incident to tho&s;e new-comers who u&s;e a &s;ea life, it is probable that the diet, and other circum&s;tances peculiar to a &s;ea life, tend to pro|duce
<PB N="10" REF="17">it, and therefore a fre&s;h and vegetable diet &s;hould be u&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible upon fir&s;t coming into this climate, and indeed ever afterwards. As the bowels are the &s;eat of this di&s;ea&s;e, every error in diet &s;hould be carefully avoided, and moderation in point of the quantity of what we eat and drink is as nece&s;&s;ary as the choice in point of quality. The nature of the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;uch that it is nece&s;&s;ary to pay greater attention to cleanline&s;s and the &s;eparation of the &s;ick than in fevers, as it is more catching and more offen&s;ive. It has been found of material benefit in preventing dy&s;eateries to put quick-lime into the water, the bad quality of which concurs with other cau&s;es in producing them in this climate. This is a good practice every where, and at all times, for nothing is more powerful in &s;weetening and pre&s;erving water than this &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have thus gone through the two acute di&s;ea&s;es to which &s;eamen are mo&s;t liable, namely, Fever and Flux. If I were to mention any others, they would be Colds and feveri&s;h and rheumatic complaints in con&s;equence of cold and wet. All &s;orts of fevers may be more or le&s;s owing to cold and moi&s;ture, and infection it&s;elf will frequently not take effect without their influence. They are fruitful &s;ources of complaint even in hot cli|mates, and it is a great point to pre&s;erve clothing uniform and dry as the body when under the influence of external heat is extremely &s;en&s;ible to every change and vici&s;&s;itude in the quality of the air. To prevent the&s;e effects I have nothing to add to what has been already mentioned, except to recommend a prudent u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors in ca&s;es of expo&s;ure and fatigue, and to &s;uit the clothing to the climate and fea&s;on. The virtue of &s;pirits is very much heightened by infu&s;ing garlick in them, and this is perhaps the be&s;t known pre&s;ervative for &s;eamen again&s;t the cold and damps of northerly climates.</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance highly de&s;erving attention, though not referable to any of the articles we have mentioned. It is the &s;tate of the &s;hip's coppers, which not being tinned are extremely apt to contract ver|digri&s;e, one of the mo&s;t deadly poi&s;ons known, and frequently the un&s;u&s;|pected cau&s;e of di&s;orders.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS on the WEST-INDIA Station.</HEAD>
<P>The following remarks upon this &s;ubject are important, as they parti|cularly re&s;pect the We&s;t-India &s;tation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The abu&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors is extremely pernicious every where, but a number of circum&s;tances concur to make it particularly &s;o here. Rum is not only cheap and ea&s;ily procured, but that which is &s;old to &s;ailors is generally of an extremely bad and unwhole&s;ome quality. Add to this that this &s;pecies of debauchery is more hurtful in a hot than in a cold or temperate climate. No pains &s;hould therefore be &s;pared to keep &s;uch rum from them, and care &s;hould be taken that they be &s;upplied with what is old and &s;ound. A water or two more &s;hould be added to the grog in this climate, or wine &s;hould be &s;erved in place of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seamen &s;hould be allowed to go on &s;hore as little as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;peci|ally at night, for they are here expo&s;ed not only to the land air from mar&s;hes that are generally near the &s;hore, and thereby catch intermittent fevers, but they find the means and opportunity of getting drunk. The &s;ure and natural remedy of the&s;e evils is to prevent them as much as po&s;&s;ible from going a&s;hore, and on no account to permit them to &s;tay all night. Many valuable lives would be &s;aved by each &s;hip hiring a boat's crew of negroes or others &s;ea&s;oned to the climate for the purpo&s;e of wooding and watering. It mo&s;t commonly happens that part of the &s;hip's company are under the nece&s;&s;ity of performing the&s;e duties, and in this ca&s;e they will be pre&s;erved from harm by each man taking half a wine gla&s;s or le&s;s of the tincture of Peruvian bark before going a&s;hore.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This may be thought too trouble&s;ome to be practi&s;ed in the hurry of &s;ervice, and I have in general purpo&s;ely avoided mentioning any thing but what is ea&s;ily practicalle and highly important to the body of &s;eamen at large, but &s;uch a precaution as is mentioned alone may, at lea&s;t, be &s;erviceable to officers, or to a &s;hip's company where &s;ervice is ea&s;y and on a &s;mall &s;cale.
<P>It was found the means of preventing &s;ickne&s;s on the coa&s;t of Guinea, by Mr. Robert&s;on, &s;urgeon of the Rainbow, in the late peace, and by the &s;ame means Count Bonneval and his &s;uite entirely e&s;caped &s;ickne&s;s in the camps in Hungary while half the army was cut off by fevers.

<P N="3">3 The cold bath, e&s;pecially in the morning, before the heat is inten&s;e and the per&s;piration profu&s;e, has been found of the utmo&s;t benefit in pre|&s;erving health in hot clinates. Tho&s;e who have had the per&s;everance to make their men practice it, have been amply rewarded for their trouble by their &s;hip's company remaining healthy. I could name in&s;tances of this fact both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P N="4">4. Care &s;hould be taken not to harrais men too much with labour or other hard&s;hips upon fir&s;t coming to this climate, for the&s;e are favourable to the attack of the fevers and fluxes with which almo&s;t all &s;hips are more or le&s;s &s;ea&s;oned upon their fir&s;t arrival.</P>
<P N="5">5. As men are more &s;ubject to &s;ickne&s;s in port than at &s;ea, this might be remedied by making the &s;hip ride with a &s;pring upon the cable, and by making her lie as much out of the lee of the land as is &s;afe and con|venient, e&s;pecially where the adjacent &s;hore is muddy or &s;wampy. This la&s;t circum&s;tance is in &s;ome &s;ituations of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and a hundred fathoms in a road has been known to make a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential dif|ference in the Lealth of a &s;hip's company.</P>

<HEAD>OF WATER.</HEAD>
<P>As water is one of the articles mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the health of a &s;hip's company, it de&s;erves particular attention. Spring water is to be preferred to running water, as the latter, e&s;pecially in a hot climate which teems with life, is apt to be impregnated with decayed vegetable and animal &s;ub|&s;tances, &s;uch as leaves, gra&s;s, wood and infects. This is the mo&s;t pre|judicial
<PB N="13" REF="20">kind of impurity, for the mineral impregnations common in &s;prings are &s;eldom at all unwhole&s;ome, and do not tend like the other to make the water corrupt. It is of con&s;equence that the ca&s;ks be well &s;ea|&s;oned by age and u&s;e, and a fumigation with &s;ulphur before they are filled has the be&s;t effect in preventing them from contaminating the water. It has al&s;o been found that butts by being filled for &s;ome time with &s;ea water, are thereby prevented from communicating any bad quality to fre&s;h water. If running water only can be had, the be&s;t means of ren|dering it pure and &s;weet is to put a pint of quick-lime into each butt when it is filled. I have mentioned that this has been thought to have &s;ome effect in preventing the flux. There are &s;everal other &s;ub&s;tances that have been found u&s;eful in correcting bad water, &s;uch as allum, cream of tartar, burnt bi&s;cuit, vinegar and acid fruits, &s;uch as tamarinds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Charles Saunders found that the water of the river St. Lawrence brought on fluxes, and that four pounds of lurnt bi&s;cuit put into each butt removed the noxious quality.</NOTE> If water is gro&s;sly impure, filtering is one of the be&s;t means of purifying it. As a dripping-&s;tone will not produce enough for a &s;hip's company, the following expeditious method may be practi&s;ed. Let a quantity of &s;and be put at the bottom of a barrel placed on one end, without the head, and let another barrel of a much &s;maller &s;ize, with both ends knockt out, or an open cylinder of any kind, be placed erect in it, and almo&s;t filled with &s;and; if impure water be poured into the &s;mall barrel or cylinder, it will ri&s;e up through the &s;and of both barrels, and appear pure above the &s;and of the large one in the interval between it and the &s;mall one. But if water &s;hould be offen&s;ive by being long kept, the mo&s;t effectual and expeditious method of &s;weetening it is by expo&s;ing it to the air in as divided a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible; and this is be&s;t done by Mr. O&s;bridge's machine, which no &s;hip &s;hould be without. If it is wanting, the place of it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be &s;upplied by blowing air through the water with a long|nozzled bellows, or the following contrivance will be found to afford a &s;ufficient &s;upply of &s;weet water to particular me&s;&s;es, and will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a dripping-&s;tone. Let the narrow mouth of a large funnel be filled with a bit of &s;punge, over which let there be a layer of &s;and and
<PB N="14" REF="21">gravel covered with a piece of flannel, and over the whole another layer of &s;and. Care mu&s;t be taken to change the &s;and, &s;punge, &amp;c. whenever they become loaded with the impurities of the water.</P>
<P>There &s;hould be in every &s;hip an apparatus for di&s;tilling water in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s. This con&s;i&s;ts merely of a head and worm adapted to the com|mon boiler, and the di&s;tillation may go on while the victuals are boiling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place of it may be &s;upplied by a tea kettle with the handle taken off and inverted upon the boiler with a gun barrel adapted to the &s;pout pa&s;&s;ing through a barrel of water, or kept con&s;tant|ly wet with a map. I cannot help here mentioning al&s;o, that in ca&s;e of great extremity, it has been found that the blood may be diluted, and thir&s;t removed by wetting the &s;urface of the body even with &s;ea water, the vapour of which is always fre&s;h, and is inhaled by ve&s;&s;els on the &s;kin, who&s;e natural function it is to imbibe the moi&s;ture that &s;wats in the atmo&s;phere.

<HEAD>III. OF SCURVY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the di&s;ea&s;e mo&s;t fatal to &s;eamen next to fevers. It was for|merly perhaps as fatal, but &s;ome modern improvements in the mode of life have rendered it le&s;s frequent and violent.

The greate&s;t part of the food of a &s;hip's company is nece&s;&s;arily &s;alt provi&s;ions. Bi&s;cuit and pea&s;e, though of a vegetable nature, are hard of dige&s;tion, and though they no doubt qualify the animal food, they do not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of fre&s;h vegetables. There are &s;everal other circum&s;tances be&s;ides diet which contribute to render a &s;ailor's life unnatural and full of hard&s;hip, and concur with it in producing &s;curvy. The&s;e are chiefly a &s;carcity or bad quality of water, a cold moi&s;t and foul air, either from climate or from the manner in which a &s;hip is kept, bad clothing, damp and dirty bedding or apartments, and too much crouding. It is al&s;o remark'd that the lazy and indolent are always mo&s;t liable to it.</P>
<P>With regard to provi&s;ions, be&s;ides its being recommended to carry to &s;ea as large a &s;upply of live &s;tock and &s;mall beer, or other fermented liquors as the nature of tho&s;e articles will allow, the world has lately been made acquainted with articles of a more durable and portable na|ture, which &s;o qualify the &s;alt provi&s;ion and crude bi&s;cuit that they can be u&s;ed without inducing di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As bread is a principal article of diet, the utmo&s;t care &s;hould be taken in pre&s;erving it, and great advantage would ari&s;e from keeping it in ca&s;ks that are water tight in&s;tead of keeping it in bags or laying it loo&s;e in a bread-room. Capt. Cooke by this method, and by giving it a ca&s;t of the oven in the cour&s;e of the voyage, pre&s;erved his bi&s;cuit &s;ound in every re&s;pect for more than three years. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of malt, which being well rammed in ca&s;ks of this kind will keep for nearly the &s;ame length of time.

The&s;e are extremely whole&s;ome, nouri&s;h|ing, and anti-&s;corbutic, and tho&s;e who have tried to &s;ub&s;titute them for butter have found the change to be popular among the &s;eamen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mola&s;&s;es and rice were found &s;o effectual in preventing and curing the &s;curvy in North-America that Lord Howe i&s;&s;ued a general injunction for the u&s;e of them, and the &s;ucce&s;s was an|&s;werable to his expectation. The u&s;e of &s;alt provi&s;ions &s;hould at the &s;ame time be &s;trongly prohi|bited. Oatmeal is in a great mea&s;ure an unnece&s;&s;ary article of expence to Government in victual|ing for this country, both becau&s;e the articles we have mentioned are fully more cheap and whole|&s;ome, and the &s;eamen like it &s;o little that they will hardly touch it. A &s;mall quantity, however, would be extremely u&s;eful if employed to make what is called Flummery or Sooins, which is a food extremely light, cooling, and ea&s;ily prepared, and was found to cure &s;curvy effectually on board the E&s;&s;ex in the late war. Capt. Cooke found wheat to an&s;wer in place of oatmeal, and this or barley would be a good &s;ub&s;titute, for part of it at lea&s;t, in victualling the navy. A great part of the oatmeal that is &s;erved is thrown overboard, and without determining which grain is mo&s;t whole&s;ome, any change that can induce men to eat a great quantity of either with their &s;alt provi&s;ions mu&s;t have a good effect.</NOTE> When captures are made, in which there are mola&s;&s;es, &s;ugar, rice or cocoa, part &s;hould be appropriated to the u&s;e of the &s;hip's company and deducted from their fourth part.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides diet, there are other articles of the naval oeconomy almo&s;t as e&s;&s;ential to the prevention of this di&s;ea&s;e. As indolence is both a cau&s;e and a &s;ymptom of it, idlene&s;s and <HI>&s;kulking</HI> &s;hould be rigidly di&s;couraged, unle&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o far advanced as to render it cruel and even im|po&s;&s;ible to force men to take exerci&s;e. The &s;ame tone of mind that in|clines a man to lazine&s;s di&s;po&s;es his temper al&s;o to low &s;pirits, which tend to foment every di&s;ea&s;e, but particularly the &s;curvy, and encourage|ment &s;hould be given to whatever produces jollity, contentment and good humour. It is uniformly ob&s;erved that &s;eamen are le&s;s &s;ubject to &s;curvy than marines and land&s;men, which is probably owing to the greater activity of their life and alacrity of their minds. The other circum&s;tances of mo&s;t importance are, dryne&s;s, airine&s;s, roomine&s;s, every article of cleanline&s;s, and warm clothing where the climate and &s;ea&s;on require it. The directions given in the&s;e points for the prevention of fevers will al&s;o &s;erve on this head, and it may be remarked farther in favour of cleanli|ne&s;s that it is not only directly conducive to health, but to good order,
<PB N="18" REF="25">&s;obriety and other virtues.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The impertance of this will further appear when we con&s;ider the effect of filth upon the general health of mankind, for it is the origin of a very large tribe of acute di&s;ea&s;es (by which are meant fevers and feveri&s;h complaints.) This is one of the cur&s;es entailed on us by clothing, which, more than any of the deviations from nature peculiar to our &s;pecies, renders man &s;ubject to di&s;temper above the re&s;t of the animal creation.</NOTE> It is al&s;o worth ob&s;erving, with regard to general health, that there are few things more de&s;erving of attention than the guarding again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive fatigue. It would be well if it could be rendered conventent at all times, except in ca&s;es of danger or emergency, to put the men at three watches in&s;tead of watch and watch. This would have the mo&s;t happy effect upon their health, by allowing them to have compleat re&s;t, and to get thoroughly dry. Fatigue is a very frequent means of bringing on di&s;ea&s;e and breaking the con&s;titution, and it is a cir|cum&s;tance in which young officers are apt to forget them&s;elves. They &s;hould therefore take care how they <HI>call all hands</HI> wantonly, and oblige men to exertions beyond their &s;trength, e&s;pecially as this will be &s;ubmitted to more readily by &s;ailors than any other &s;et of men, from the generous alacrity of their nature. One of the happy effects re&s;ulting from the good treatment of &s;eamen is the encouragement it gives men to enter into the &s;ervice, and to do their duty with cheerfulne&s;s and re&s;olution. There is &s;omething more daunting to the mind of man to &s;ee his fellow creatures langui&s;hing in di&s;ea&s;e, or peri&s;hing mi&s;erably from &s;ores or &s;ickne&s;s, than in the terrors of fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>The whole of the&s;e ob&s;ervations are meant to have re&s;pect to the pre|vention of di&s;ea&s;e, and the means of it fall within the province of tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the direction of the navy, either in a civil or mi|litary capacity. But with regard to cure and recovery a great deal is al&s;o in their power by providing and recommending proper diet and cordials.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Though there is &s;till room for improvement, the Navy, I am told, is now on a better foot|ing with regard to the health and comfort of &s;eamen than in former times. The victuals are in general &s;ounder and better; the civil department has &s;hewn in many in&s;tances a readine&s;s to adopt the means and to furni&s;h the articles that have been recommended for the health of the men; and &s;uch commanders as I have the honour to know are humane, attentive and intelligent.</NOTE>A liberal u&s;e of good wine would &s;ave many lives, both by its virtue in curing low and malignant fevers, and as a re&s;torative to convale&s;cents,
<PB N="19" REF="26">numbers of whom are lo&s;t by relap&s;es, or pine away in drop&s;ies and other chronic complaints, for want of &s;uitable diet in the article of drink as well as food. The nece&s;&s;aries of a &s;urgeon are by no means adequate to this, and care &s;hould be taken to lay in portable &s;oup, rice, &s;ago, &s;alop and currants, and to procure fre&s;h meat wherever it can be had for the convale&s;cent and &s;corbutic patients. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that this would not only be an object of humanity, but a great pecuniary &s;aving, con&s;ider|ing how expen&s;ive it is to &s;upport invalids, and to replace men; not to mention that it is upon the health and lives of men that all public exer|tions e&s;&s;entially depend.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the accounts furni&s;hed by hi&s;tory of the lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appoint|ments to public &s;ervice from the prevalence of di&s;ea&s;e in fleets. Without mentioning the di&s;a&s;ters occa&s;ioned by it to Sir Richard Hawkins, who &s;ays that in twenty years he had known of ten thou&s;and men who had &s;eri&s;hed at &s;ea by the &s;curvy, nor to Commodore An&s;on. who in the cour&s;e of his voyage lo&s;t more than &s;cur fifths of his &s;hip's company. I &s;hall recount a few in&s;tances that have occurred to me in hi&s;tory of expeditions that have been fru&s;trated in their object from the force of di&s;ea&s;e alone: That under Count Mansfedt in <HI>1624:</HI> that under the Duke of Buck|ingham the year after: that under Sir Francis Wheeler in <HI>1693:</HI> that to Carthagena in <HI>1742:</HI> that of the French under D'Anville in <HI>1746;</HI> and that of the &s;ame nation to Loui&s;tourg in <HI>1757.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Since we are upon this &s;ubject, it may be ob&s;erved that there are &s;everal particulars in which officers may be &s;ub&s;idiary to the &s;urgeons. For ex|ample, it is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence that men &s;hould complain early, as very little medical attention will prevent a fever or flux if taken in time, particularly in this climate. As &s;eamen are aver&s;e to complain, and may e&s;cape the attention of the &s;urgeon till their di&s;temper has gained ground, officers, by noting in a book made on purpo&s;e for the daily in&s;pection of the &s;urgeon, tho&s;e who are mi&s;&s;ed from duty upon calling the watch, and even tho&s;e who are remarked to droop and look ill, may get men put upon the &s;ick li&s;t, and proper means u&s;ed for their recovery in the begin|ning of their complaints.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there is no &s;ituation of life in which there is room for more virtues, more conduct and addre&s;s, than that of a &s;ea officer. Men are thrown upon his humanity and attention in more views than one: They are &s;ubject to a more arbitrary exertion of power than the con&s;ti|tution authorizes in other departments of the State: it is their character
<PB N="20" REF="27">to be thoughtle&s;s and neglectful of their own intere&s;t and welfare, requi|ring to be tended like children, and from their utility, bravery and other re&s;pectable qualities, they are &s;urely entitled to a degree of parental ten|derne&s;s and attention, both from the State they protect and the officers they obey.</P>
