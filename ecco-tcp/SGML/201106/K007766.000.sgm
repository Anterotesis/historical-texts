<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE very name of a <HI>Nostrum,</HI> or <HI>Patent Medicine</HI> generally conveys the idea of impo&s;ture; nor is it matter of &s;urpri&s;e. Almo&s;t every &s;hop is furni&s;hed with &s;ecret me|dicines, and hand-bills and news-papers, in &s;warms, ince&s;&s;antly cry up their infallible vir|tues, and boldly promi&s;e a certain cure for every di&s;ea&s;e, whether within or beyond the reach of art. This &s;ort of medicine never abounded more than in the pre&s;ent age. Seldom a month elap|&s;es, but &s;omething new is intruded as a &s;pecific. And yet, it may be &s;aid with truth, every &s;pe|cies of di&s;ea&s;e is as frequent as ever; and &s;ome kinds, particularly the putrid, the &s;corbutic, and tho&s;e called <HI>nervous,</HI> are known to gain ground. But it would be well for the credulous, if the u&s;e of <HI>mo&s;t</HI> of the adverti&s;ed medicines, only thinned their pockets, or di&s;appointed their ex|pectation of undoubted recovery. It is every where well known that many valetudinarians have &s;uffered and daily do &s;uffer by the u&s;e of tho&s;e me|dicines, their complaints being &s;ometimes increa|&s;ed,
<PB N="2" REF="3">or vitiated humours tran&s;lated to a more no|ble and therefore more dangerous part; at other times new di&s;orders are formed, and, not unfre|quently, the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms come on, and death at length clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem from the futility, or mi&s;chievous effects of <HI>many</HI> no&s;trums, that any medicine, whatever be its real excellence, if offered to the public under the veil of &s;ecre&s;y, lies under a great di&s;advantage, and mu&s;t meet, more or le&s;s, with cen&s;ure and contempt. Many undoubtedly who are fond of invective, and wi&s;h to make a &s;how of &s;uperior judgment, will <HI>indi&s;criminately</HI> con|demn <HI>every</HI> medicine of the &s;ort, and pretend to behold nothing but intere&s;ted artifice on the part of the proprietor, and mi&s;chief, or, at lea&s;t, in|&s;ignificancy on the part of the medicine. But this dogmatical method of condemning is evi|dently erroneous, and mu&s;t expo&s;e them that adopt it to ridicule and de&s;erved cen&s;ure; it being in fact as ab&s;urd as, on the other hand, it would be, to believe implicity all the virtues a&s;cribed to every no&s;trum, or to every &s;imple, &amp;c. either in an antient, or a modern <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> As no rank of per&s;ons, &s;o no cla&s;s of things <HI>univer|&s;ally</HI> de&s;erves either panegyric or invective. The merits or demerits of each mu&s;t be &s;ingly con&s;i|dered, and when weighed in the balance of im|partial
<PB N="3" REF="4">critici&s;m, receive prai&s;e or cen&s;ure, ac|cording to its re&s;pective degree of worth or vile|ne&s;s. As common &s;en&s;e forbids to inveigh a|gain&s;t <HI>all</HI> &s;overeigns, becau&s;e <HI>&s;ome</HI> are tyrants: to cen&s;ure <HI>all</HI> the profe&s;&s;ors of the law, becau&s;e <HI>many</HI> of them are obnoxious to it; to condemn all phy&s;icians, becau&s;e &s;ome are illiterate; or, with the medical Quixot, to declaim again&s;t the u&s;e of bread, becau&s;e it is often ill made: &s;o like|wi&s;e it will re&s;train the impartial and di&s;cerning from crying down <HI>every</HI> &s;ecret medicine, notwith|&s;tanding <HI>many</HI> of them are the brats of mere quackery and impo&s;ture. Should a phy&s;ician di&s;cover, for in&s;tance, a more efficacious prepa|ration of the Peruvian bark than is yet known, keep the preparation &s;ecret, and adverti&s;e and di&s;per&s;e it after the u&s;ual manner of no&s;trums; the bark would not, for this rea&s;on, be le&s;s u&s;e|ful; nor de&s;erve the cen&s;ure of the public, be|cau&s;e veiled from its eye. Even the great Hoff|man, and other fir&s;t rate phy&s;icians, as well as quacks and medica&s;ters, have had their No&s;|trums. It is not therefore the mere &s;ecre&s;y of a medicine, or the manner in which it is exhibited to the world; 'tis its being trifling or dangerous that mu&s;t draw upon it the contempt and abhor|rence, which are due to the <HI>major part</HI> of adver|ti&s;ed medicines.
<PB N="4" REF="5"></P>
<P>From the premi&s;es it appears, notwith&s;tand|ing the u&s;ual and <HI>commonly</HI> ju&s;t outcry again&s;t no&s;trums, that a medicine may with proprie|ty be recommended, and with &s;ervice intro|duced to general u&s;e, although its compo&s;ition be not declared. There may be honour and &s;kill on the part of the inventor or proprietor, and efficacy in the medicine.</P>
<P>On this foundation a remedy is now offered, the want of which has hitherto been, and &s;till is fatal to a great part of them, who by their &s;ex are liable to a greater number of di&s;ea&s;es than men, and by their characteri&s;tic qualifications claim the &s;tricte&s;t attention, &amp;c. I need not &s;ay that I mean the fair &s;ex. There is a period of their lives, when the <HI>men&s;es</HI> or monthly evacua|tions begin to be irregular, and then finally cea&s;e. This period admits of great latitude and many exceptions, but generally happens between the age of forty and fifty, and is the mo&s;t criti|cal time of women's lives; the final irregularity and ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> being the origin of mo&s;t, perhaps, of all the di&s;ea&s;es which attack them either at that or any other &s;ucceeding time. Many, who till this period had enjoyed the in|valuable ble&s;&s;ing of health, are then &s;eized with one or other of the various complaints that af|flict the human frame. Some are &s;peedily &s;natch|ed
<PB N="5" REF="6">away by an acute di&s;ea&s;e: others fall a prey to a chronic di&s;temper, and become invalids for life. Many indeed, by a peculiar happine&s;s of con&s;titution, pa&s;s over this period without any remarkable inconvenience: yet, their num|ber is much the larger, who are then troubled with ailments, and in the&s;e ca&s;es it is the com|mon practice to pre&s;cribe a few do&s;es of phy&s;ic: but as the&s;e &s;eldom remove, or even touch the cau&s;e, &s;o they rarely effect a cure. The event of which is, that the ailments increa&s;e, and a di&s;|order is at length formed, either of the acute or chronic kind, which, &s;till gaining ground from the pre&s;ence or continuation of the primary cau&s;e, baffles the u&s;ual methods of cure, and the medioines, which otherwi&s;e might have an|&s;wered every intention, here, at mo&s;t, only pal|liate the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>But it may be queried: How can any medi|cine be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch exten&s;ive effica|cy, as to &s;ubdue the variety of di&s;ea&s;es to which Females are expo&s;ed at the afore&s;aid period? This query &s;hall be fairly con&s;idered. Its elucidation will clearly point out what judgment is to be formed both of the medicine here recommended, and in general of others that are adverti&s;ed.</P>
<P>In variety of in&s;tances, it is demon&s;trable, that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e may proceed from very different
<PB N="6" REF="7">can&s;es; and it is equally certain, that according to the diver&s;ity of the cau&s;e, the method of cure mu&s;t al&s;o be varied. It is, again, a certainty, that the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t often be treated in a different manner, by rea&s;on of the difference of con&s;titution, age, &s;ex; and of the different ap|pearance, degree, inveteracy of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; and moreover, by rea&s;on of its combination with &s;ome other di&s;temper. It is thus in the headach, toothach, quin&s;ies, coughs; in con&s;umptions or decays; in the apoplexy, pal&s;y, deafne&s;s; in colics; in convul&s;ive di&s;orders, the epilep&s;y, tre|mours; in the hypochondriac or nervous di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the rheumati&s;m, the &s;curvy, cachexies, the vertigo, pleuri&s;ies, me|lancholy, madne&s;s, &amp;c. &amp;c. and was the whole catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es to be ran through, and the principles of rational or judicious practice con&s;i|dered, it would be found that the above variety of cau&s;es, con&s;titution, age, &amp;c. require to be &s;o accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed and attended to, that otherwi&s;e the be&s;t general method would fre|quently prove fruitle&s;s or noxious; and con&s;e|quently that more or le&s;s difference in pre&s;crib|ing medicines, or a method of treatment, will often be requi&s;ite for the recovery of &s;ive patients out of &s;ix labouring under the &s;ame di&s;order. With what &s;hadow of probability then can the
<PB N="7" REF="8">&s;ame drug, or compo&s;ition, be fondly imagined a never-failing cure for all afflicted with the &s;curvy, or for all epileptics, all that are con|&s;umptive, or, in &s;hort, for all patients troubled with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;u|perable impediments ari&s;ing from the diver&s;ity of cau&s;es creating the di&s;ea&s;e; from its changes, its complication with others; from the difference of age, &s;ex, temperament, &s;ea&s;ons, &amp;c? Can the &s;ame medicine brace the fibres of youth and delicacy, and relax tho&s;e of age? or warm the chills of the lymphatic con&s;titution, and cool the heats of the &s;anguine? or break down the vi&s;ci|dity of the blood, and conquer its putrefactive diathe&s;is? or act as a re&s;torative in di&s;ea&s;es from inanition, and perform the office of evacuants in the &s;ame, when brought on by a plethora? or remove tho&s;e cholics, &amp;c. in which warm medi|cines are e&s;&s;ential, and the cool de&s;tructive; and tho&s;e too <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> where the warm de&s;troy, and the cooling &s;ave? Neverthele&s;s, &s;ome of the&s;e, or other &s;uch oppo&s;ite indications, are commonly met with in the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, and proceed either from the varying &s;ymptoms which attend its different &s;tages and progre&s;s, or, as was &s;aid before, from the diver&s;ity of its cau&s;e, of the patient's con&s;ti|tution, &amp;c. But as rationally might we believe the promi&s;ed feats of a bottle-conjurer, or ex|pect
<PB N="8" REF="9">adventurers to inhabit the bottom of the &s;ea, and revi&s;it its &s;urface at plea&s;ure, as fan|cy that any medicine can po&s;&s;e&s;s qualities dia|metrically oppo&s;ite, and corre&s;pond with the widely differing intentions and methods of cure, which are &s;o often requi&s;ite in order to treat the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e with &s;ucce&s;s. Hence is evinced, not only the &s;mall dependence that can be had on the <HI>generality</HI> of adverti&s;ed medicines, but al&s;o the danger that mu&s;t attend their u&s;e: and in fact, where they chance to &s;uit the con&s;titution of <HI>one</HI> invalid, accord with every &s;ymptom and indica|tion of his di&s;ea&s;e, and thus luckily perform a cure; perhaps ten others, afflicted with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, find no relief; and as many more reap nothing from their trial but the aggravation of their complaints.</P>
<P>If any medicines in the world can e&s;tabli&s;h a well grounded confidence of their &s;afety and ef|ficacy, it mu&s;t be tho&s;e which are u&s;ually term|ed <HI>&s;pecifics.</HI> But how &s;mall is their number? and how very frequently do they fail of &s;ucce&s;s? how often is their trial attended even with di&s;ad|vantage, with an increa&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e they were intended to cure? or with the introduction of &s;ome other? And whence all this, but becau&s;e they are often admini&s;tered without di&s;cernment: the remperament of the patient, the cau&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="10">or &s;ome concomitant &s;ymptoms, are not ta|ken into con&s;ideration? Again, they may be ex|hibited at an improper time, too &s;oon, or too late; or without a cautious preparation; or are given in an incongruous form or quantity; or are not qualified with the addition of other &s;uit|able ingredients, which, by re&s;training or increa&s;|ing &s;ome of their properties, &s;hould promote their efficacy. Such is too often the fate of the Peruvian bark in intermittents, of opium in &s;pa&s;ms, of tin for worms, of &s;teel for the chlo|ro&s;is, of cerated gla&s;s of antimony for the dy&s;en|tery and &s;anguineous fluxes. Such likewi&s;e the fate attending the <HI>injudicious</HI> u&s;e of Dr. James' celebrated powder, which, though a medicine of &s;overeign efficacy, when given under his in|&s;pection, or preci&s;ely according to his directions, has neverthele&s;s been productive of many bad con&s;equences, and has &s;ometimes proved almo&s;t &s;uddenly fatal: and why? becau&s;e given with|out nece&s;&s;ary precautions, or in ca&s;es, in which that ingenious Phy&s;ician, as be&s;t knowing its compo&s;ition and &s;trength, would have judged it improper, perhaps perilous.</P>
<P>The difficulties and danger which accompany the u&s;e of mo&s;t no&s;trums, or the un&s;kilful exhi|bition
<PB N="10" REF="11">of other medicines, and which ari&s;e, in part, from their not being &s;uited to the cau&s;es and complication of di&s;ea&s;es, to the difference of age, &s;ex. &amp;c. have no place in the pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject of enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> a method of treatment to prevent or remove the complaints which attend or follow the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es.</HI> Here one &s;ex only is concerned: age is nearly the &s;ame: the di&s;ea&s;es or complications of di&s;ea&s;e, which frequently &s;eize the fair at or after the &s;aid period, are indeed various, yet the cau&s;e is but <HI>one.</HI> Such the difference between this and other medicines propo&s;ed as general cures for any malady. Al|mo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e may have various, and &s;ome|times oppo&s;ite cau&s;es: the remedies therefore mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the &s;ame variations, and to more &s;till, when con&s;titution, age, &s;ex, &amp;c. are taken into the account. But re&s;pecting the Re|medy now offered to the fair, every thing wears the plea&s;ing a&s;pect of certainty and &s;afety. It is adapted to them, to the critical period of their lives, to the radical cau&s;e which at that time in|volves &s;o many of them in almo&s;t all the evils of pain and di&s;ea&s;e The varieties that may occur in their u&s;e of this remedy, ari&s;e chiefly from the kind of morbid quality that may chance to affect
<PB N="11" REF="12">the fluids, and from the difference of con&s;titu|tion, whether &s;anguine, lymphatic, &amp;c. or from their being of a robu&s;t and healthy, or a delicate and infirm habit. The&s;e variations are duly con|&s;idered; and directions adapted to each, together with cautions and methods to be ob&s;erved in the ca&s;es that u&s;ually happen at this period, are laid down clearly and explicity, and will be pre&s;ented with the medicine.</P>
<P>But to proceed. As it may be acceptable to many to be informed of the complaints, di&s;ea&s;es, danger, which frequently accompany or follow the final ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> and to know what grounds there are to expect requi&s;ite a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance at that period from the u&s;e of the Remedy and method of treatment here recommended, I &s;hall enter more minutely into the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>One grand point in the medical art is to di&s;co|ver and di&s;tingui&s;h the real cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e: a|nother, to choo&s;e that method of cure, which, all things con&s;idered, is &s;pecifically proper, &s;afe, and e&s;&s;ectual.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es owe their formation either to &s;ome fault in the quantity, or to the morbid qualities, of the blood and other fluids.&mdash;The principal cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es which afflict fe|males
<PB N="12" REF="13">at the period in que&s;tion is manife&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> a general or partial plethora brought on by the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es.</HI>&mdash;When a long accu&s;tom|ed evacuation cea&s;es, a redundancy of blood, &amp;c. mu&s;t en&s;ue, and this exce&s;s now confined in the body, receiving fre&s;h additions, and its won|ted drain being checked, mu&s;t either di&s;order the whole frame, by bringing on a general di&s;ea&s;e, or, collect in particular parts, and generate the di&s;orders to which tho&s;e parts are re&s;pectively &s;ubject. This is evident in the ce&s;&s;ation of the haemorrhoids, of the haemorrhage of the no&s;e, or of other u&s;ual &s;anguine evacuations: the con|&s;equence being many, and &s;ometimes fatal di&s;ea|&s;es: but daily ob&s;ervation demon&s;trates, that tho&s;e which follow the final ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> are more in number, and attended with greater peril.&mdash;Secondly, any morbid quality of the blood, &amp;c, whether acrimonious, vi&s;cid, di&s;&s;ol|vent, &amp;c. that exi&s;ted in the habit before the ce&s;&s;ation, after it, becomes more predominant: and the&s;e morbid qualities of the blood al&s;o give birth to a variety of di&s;orders.</P>
<P>From one or other of the&s;e cau&s;es &s;ingly, or, from their complication, proceed the various di&s;|ea&s;es with which females are affected at the turn
<PB N="13" REF="14">of life, <HI>viz.</HI> headachs, &s;pa&s;modic pains, the <HI>ver|tigo,</HI> large haemorrhages of the no&s;e. In the throat a quin&s;y &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds. The parts contained within the brea&s;t have their &s;hare of vexatious &s;ymptoms: a palpitation of the heart, an unea|&s;ine&s;s in the <HI>praecordia,</HI> with difficult breathing, violent and la&s;ting coughs, the convul&s;ive or dry a&s;thma, pleuritic pains; not rarely a &s;pitting of blood, which returns at the u&s;ual time of the <HI>men&s;es.</HI>&mdash;Variety of pains and ailments attack the &s;tomach, flatulencies, di&s;tentions, the <HI>cardialgia,</HI> the heart-burning, lo&s;s of appetite, &amp;c.&mdash;Colics often torment the bowels. Nau&s;eas and reach|ings to vomit are not unfrequent: even a vomit|ing of blood now and then alarms the patient.&mdash;The loins have their unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and an inflammation of the kidneys has often followed. It is ea&s;y to conceive that the womb particularly, when the <HI>men&s;es</HI> cea&s;e to flow, becomes a &s;eat of di&s;ea&s;e. A &s;en&s;ation of weight and di&s;tention are here common, and pains are &s;ometimes felt which nearly equal tho&s;e of labour. Of profu&s;e, frequent, and &s;ometimes fatal haemorrhages, of drop&s;ies, inflammations, ulcers, &s;cirrhous tu|mours, cancers of this part, in&s;tances are frequent. Sometimes a tumour or hard &s;ub&s;tance is there
<PB N="14" REF="15">formed of con&s;iderable &s;ize. Its weight, the fre|quent and violent returns of pain, the attendant fever, and other &s;ymptoms, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e which accompany a mole. At other times the whole <HI>abdomen</HI> or belly grows big and turgid, and in &s;ize and appearance re&s;embles that of a pregnant woman. This turge&s;cency, when mi&s;|taken for pregancy, or neglected, has continued in &s;ome one or two, in others ten years, and has &s;ometimes la&s;ted with life.</P>
<P>To the&s;e evils, which &s;eize particular parts, may be added tho&s;e that di&s;temper the whole ha|bit. A cacochymy or depravation of the hu|mours, and hence generally a cachexy or relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olids.&mdash;Weight and wearine&s;s of the limbs, particularly after exerci&s;e. A corpulent or rather bloated habit. Oedematous &s;wellings of the feet, &amp;c. Drop&s;ies. Gouty and rheu|matic pains, wandering or fixed. Slow or ner|vous, hectic, inflammatory fevers. A di&s;tem|perature of the nerves and their &s;ubtle fluid, which manife&s;ts it&s;elf by the frequent a&s;&s;ault of hypochondriac, hy&s;teric, convul&s;ive, or paraly|tic &s;ymptoms, &s;ome of which are mo&s;t trouble|&s;ome at the changes of the moon, and at the pe|riods when the <HI>men&s;es</HI> u&s;ually came on. Even
<PB N="15" REF="16">madne&s;s has been a con&s;equence of the ce&s;&s;ation, and was happily removed. When the humours abound with &s;corbutic &s;alts, or other foulne&s;&s;es, the itch both of the dry and moi&s;t kind, variety of other eruptions, blotches, &amp;c. disfigure and torment the patient. Ob&s;tinate ulcers and &s;pread|ing &s;ores, e&s;pecially on the legs, are very fre|quent, and the more &s;o as age advances.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e complaints, one or more of which, in a greater or le&s;s degree, too often &s;ucceed, and are occa&s;ioned by, the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> many other di&s;orders, either acute or chronical, &s;ome of which are &s;ometimes ob&s;cure and com|plicated, and perhaps not ea&s;ily reducible to a|ny cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;e, al&s;o ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e.&mdash;And here it may be ob&s;erved, that, although at the ce&s;&s;ation no pre&s;ent inconvenience be perceived, neverthele&s;s it often happens, that in the cour&s;e of &s;ome months or years after it, &s;ome di&s;order or other begins to appear, and becomes exceedingly &s;tubborn; but might have been pre|vented, had proper care been taken when the fi|nal irregularities and ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> fir&s;t came on.</P>
<P>Having now indicated, in part, the various complaints, to which the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="17">&s;ubjects the fair, it remains to &s;how, that the the medicine and method of cure recommended to their u&s;e, are adapted to the cau&s;e of the &s;aid complaints, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the properties requi|&s;ite to remove them.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved above, that the cau&s;es of the inconveniencies and di&s;ea&s;es which frequently ac|company or &s;ucceed the final ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> are chiefly a redundancy, and &s;ometimes a vitiated &s;tate of the blood and other fluids. The intentions of cure are therefore to le&s;&s;en their quantity, correct their vitiated qualities, and remove the morbid &s;ymptoms, viz. ob&s;truc|tions, relaxation, &amp;c. which they may have ge|nerated in the &s;olids.&mdash;In order to an&s;wer the&s;e intentions, the medicine under con&s;ideration is calculated to act on the blood, lymph, &amp;c. it enters even the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;&s;els, cau&s;es a free cir|culation of their contained fluids, and promotes every &s;ecretion and excretion. It likewi&s;e clean|&s;es the <HI>primae viae,</HI> and keeps the body open. By the&s;e means ob&s;tructions are removed from the uterine and other ve&s;&s;els, from the vi&s;cera, &amp;c. redundancies are carried off, and the variety of complaints, which the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> might produce in the &s;tomach and bowels, are
<PB N="17" REF="18">obviated or &s;ubdued. It moreover contains a bal&s;amic quality mo&s;t friendly to the blood, which pre&s;erves or re&s;tores the natural bal&s;am of that fluid; and, being at the &s;ame time mildly attenuating, prevents a glutinous or vi&s;cid &s;tate, which is alone productive of many di&s;orders. The &s;alutary effects of this medicine on the &s;o|lids, that is, on the ve&s;&s;els and organs of the bo|dy, merit al&s;o to be noticed: it imparts to them a ju&s;t degree of ela&s;ticity and &s;trength to protrude their contained fluids, and perform their &s;everal functions regularly and with ea&s;e. Thus, by the peculiar qualities of this medi|cine, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, when nece&s;&s;ary, by other means which will be &s;pecified in the directions, and which relate to the different &s;tate of the humours, to con&s;titution, &amp;c. the following indications are fully an&s;wered, viz. redundancies are evacu|ated and thrown off by the different emunctories, the faults of the fluids are obviated or corrected, the &s;olids are &s;trengthened, and the whole habit invigorated.</P>
<P>Here it may be remarked, that this medicine is of equal &s;ervice to females on many other oc|ca&s;ions. It frequently happens, that the fir&s;t e|ruption of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> is &s;low, difficult, &amp;c. or
<PB N="18" REF="19">that afterwards they are irregular, or deficient, or otherwi&s;e deviate from their u&s;ual and healthy appearance; or that they are checked for many months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; or in fine, perhaps entirely cea&s;e long before the u&s;ual time of their ce&s;&s;a|tion. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of their cea&s;ing entirely and finally at the ages of thirty, twenty-&s;even, twenty-&s;ix, once at twenty-five. When the above complaints occur, the &s;trong emmenagogues or forcing medicines, &s;uch as &s;teel, hellebore, &s;avin, &amp;c. are too often advi&s;|ed, but for the greater part are highly improper, and very frequently are attended with pernicious con&s;equences, particularly if the patient be of a cachectic or relaxed habit; or if the ve&s;&s;els, or the vi&s;cera be ob&s;tructed in con&s;equence of checked per&s;piration, or a cold, or of glutinous &s;luggi&s;h humours; or if the irregularity or de|fect was brought on by the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of a|&s;tringents; or, in fine, if any other &s;pecies of e|vacuation has &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or otherwi&s;e, &s;uc|ceeded the &s;aid irregularity, defect or &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion. In the&s;e ca&s;es the above medicine, as will be more particularly declared in the directions, will, without danger, an&s;wer every de&s;irable in|tention.
<PB N="19" REF="20"></P>
<P>This &s;ketch of the virtues of the Remedy and method of treatment here recommended to the &s;ex, is not merely theoretical, or merely de&s;crip|tive of the good effects which are to be wi&s;hed for when the <HI>men&s;es</HI> are irregular, deficient, or finally cea&s;e; but is in fact, a conci&s;e and can|did relation of the efficacy and &s;ucce&s;s with which their u&s;e has been accompanied in almo&s;t an infinite number of in&s;tances. The above a&s;|&s;ertions being therefore e&s;tabli&s;hed on experience, which is above all authorities&mdash;any other pane|gyric would be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es attending or following the irregu|larities and ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> which have been brought to an happy i&s;&s;ue by the method here recommended, are &s;o very numerous and various, that a de&s;criptive collection of them would &s;well to a moderate volume, and proba|bly would prove both &s;atisfactory and &s;ervice|able. Almo&s;t every female patient might di&s;co|ver therein a ca&s;e &s;imilar to her own, and with plea&s;ure ob&s;erve it had been treated with &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s. Perhaps too the profe&s;&s;ors of the healing art might not deem it an u&s;ele&s;s attempt, particularly if the writer of the&s;e lines &s;hould, in the &s;aid collection of ca&s;es, <HI>fully</HI> communicate
<PB N="20" REF="21">his ob&s;ervations on the ce&s;&s;ation of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> which though a fertile and fatal &s;ource of di&s;|ea&s;e, has hitherto been little noticed, and gene|rally improperly treated. But other avocations permit me not to &s;it down to any thing of the kind. Moreover, the fair &s;ex only being here concerned, the &s;ubject might to &s;ome appear ra|ther too delicate to admit an hi&s;torical detail and explication of ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It &s;hould therefore &s;eem &s;ufficient, that every female may know, and have it in her power to obtain, a remedy and directions, which will an|&s;wer her mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes, when arrived at the critical period of life, or when, before that period, the free and healthy emanation of the <HI>men&s;es</HI> is any way di&s;turbed. And this is the motive why the &s;aid remedy is thus offered to the &s;ex, as it will, by this publication, and by adverti&s;ements, be far more &s;peedily and uni|ver&s;ally known than by any other means. But, it may be &s;aid, is not the author's own emolu|ment al&s;o a motive? I an&s;wer, be that as it may, the efficacy of the remedy is not for that rea&s;on the le&s;s. Again, why &s;hould not the author reap &s;ome advantage from his endeavours to re|lieve and &s;ave multitudes? But, in truth, the
<PB N="21" REF="22">advantage will be in favour of the public. Fir&s;t, the medicine will be made with the be&s;t ingre|dients, and nice&s;t accuracy. The&s;e are condi|tions, without which medicines, the mo&s;t judi|ciou&s;ly pre&s;cribed, would often prove, not fruit|le&s;s only, but noxious: and, was the compo&s;i|tion of this medine declared, who would an&s;wer, that as many as made it up would &s;trictly ob|&s;erve the above conditions? Hurry, negligence, bad drugs, any pre&s;umptuous alteration, or the &s;ub&s;tituting one ingredient for another, (faults which are too common and inexcu&s;able) would fru&s;trate every hope, every wi&s;hed for effect. The&s;e uncertainties, and the dangerous con&s;e|quences of neglect, &amp;c. are cut off by entru&s;t|ing the compo&s;ition of this medicine to a per&s;on who&s;e integrity and indefatigable attention are not to be called in que&s;tion. Secondly, the price of the medicine will be reduced to the lowe&s;t, to the end that, the inferior ranks, as well as the opulent, may purcha&s;e it with ca&s;e, and, for a triflle, receive that benefit, which an expen&s;ive variety of drugs, and repeated fees, &s;eldom procure at the period, &amp;c. in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Let it be finally ob&s;erved, that hitherto this remedy has been made up in almo&s;t every form,
<PB N="22" REF="23">according to the inclination of different patients; &s;ome preferring liquid, others &s;olid forms. But now, that it is intended for more general u&s;e, it will be made into pills. This form is le&s;s liable to accidents than any other, may be carried from place to place without difficulty or injury, and be taken by patients without trouble, when on a journey, vi&s;it, &amp;c.</P>
