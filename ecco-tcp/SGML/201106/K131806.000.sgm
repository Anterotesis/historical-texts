<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is the wi&s;h of the Editor of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations to render them generally u&s;eful, pains have been taken to draw them up in &s;uch language as &s;hall be generally under&s;tood; with this view all technical terms and medical phra&s;es have been avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible; where they have nece&s;&s;arily occured they are accompanied with &s;uch explanations as it is hoped will render them perfectly intelligible to every capacity.</P>
<P>In treating of wounds a good deal of minutene&s;s has been employed; but he believes not more than is required when the importance of the &s;ubject is con&s;idered. To point out the pro|pere&s;t method of &s;topping violent bleedings, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething on the relative &s;ituation of the veins and arteries, he tru&s;ts this has been done in as clear a manner as the &s;ubject will admit of; and doubts not but a little attention will render it perfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the u&s;e and application of the medicines the &s;ame per&s;picuity has been attempted; and he hopes not attempted in vain. The do&s;es mentioned are for a grown per&s;on; the di&s;|cretion of the per&s;on admini&s;tering them will generally be &s;ufficient to direct him in any variation from the rules here laid down, that may be called for by particular circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the patient's age, &s;trength, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To captains of &s;hips this &s;mall che&s;t, with the remarks con|tained in this pamphlet, are particularly recommended. When at &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a they and their crews are cut off from the re&s;t of the world, and are indeed a little &s;ociety of them&s;elves. Thus circum&s;tanced the health and vigour of every individual becomes an object of con&s;iderable importance; in fact it is then a common concern, as few ve&s;&s;els carry more people than are required, the exer|tions
<PB REF="4">of every one is nece&s;&s;ary in order to perform the common duties of the &s;hip; and the want of one man, di&s;abled by &s;ickne&s;s or accident, where the number of the crew is by no means &s;uper|fluous, may prove in the end of very &s;erious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>To families at a di&s;tance from any town they are al&s;o cal|culated to be &s;erviceable.&mdash;By an attentive peru&s;al of the pam|phlet little doubt is entertained but the meane&s;t capacity will be enabled to hand relief in many in&s;tances, where much &s;uffering and danger might be the con&s;equence of the delay occa&s;ioned by waiting the arrival of a medical per&s;on from the di&s;tance of perhaps &s;everal miles, independant of the chance of his being from home, or engaged when &s;ent for.</P>
<P>The Editor wi&s;hes to be under&s;tood that it is not in any manner his intention to &s;ugge&s;t the inexpediency of calling in medical aid in every ca&s;e which has the appearance of danger, or from which there may be a chance of danger re&s;ulting; on the contrary he &s;trongly recommends it. He wi&s;hes to im|pre&s;s the minds of tho&s;e who may read this with the nece&s;&s;ity of early medical advice in every &s;uch ca&s;e; and repeats that it is to tho&s;e only who&s;e &s;ituation renders it impo&s;&s;ible immediately to procure &s;uch help, or to ca&s;es which are &s;light and well under&s;tood, that this Medicine Che&s;t is particularly adapted.</P>

<HEAD>WOUNDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the u&s;e of the Tourniquet or Bandage, and manner of &s;tepping violent Bleedings.</HEAD>
<P>IN treating of the management of wounds the fir&s;t thing that demands our con&s;ideration is the bleeding with which mo&s;t of them are attended. When the blood is not poured out with great force, though the quantity &s;hould even be con&s;iderable, it generally proceeds from wounded veins, and may be &s;topped by pre&s;&s;ing a piece of &s;craped lint, either alone or dipped in fine flour or Turlington's Bal&s;am, upon the wound with the fingers. But when the Hood is thrown out with great force, and e&s;pecially if it &s;prings out by jerks, it proceeds from wounded artcries, and requires the mo&s;t &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>To direct us in this ca&s;e, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the arteries as &s;trong branched pipes or tubes through which the blood is forced from the heart at each beat to every part of the trunk of the body, to the head, to the arms, and to the legs.&mdash; The veins &s;pring in &s;mall branches from all the parts the arteries carry blood to; they pur&s;ue their cour&s;e towards the heart; joining with each other, forming gradually larger and larger veins, till they reach the heart in one large trunk. The heart may be compared to a &s;ort of forcing pump, throwing the blood along the arteries with &s;uch force, that we can feel the jerk or pul&s;e wherever an artery lies: and the blood lo&s;ing its impul&s;e as it pa&s;&s;es along, makes its way, without any pul&s;e or beating, into the veins, through which it returns to the heart, compleating what is called <HI>the circulation of the Hood.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;imple principles the method of putting a &s;top to a bleeding from a wounded artery is exceedingly plain; that is, it mu&s;t be compre&s;&s;ed between the heart and the wound.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>In wounds of the foot or leg the bleeding may be &s;topped by ca&s;ting a knot in the middle of a handkerchief, placing the knot in the ham or hollow behind the knee, tying it tight before, and twitching it &s;ufficiently by means of a &s;tick, put between the place where we tye it and the thigh. The handkerchief &s;hould be tightened as quickly as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ible after it is put on, otherwi&s;e the veins will be painfully &s;tretched. For a very &s;light pre&s;&s;ure on a vein &s;tops the cour&s;e of the blood in its return to the heart, whil&s;t the artery requiring more force to ob&s;truct it, keeps throwing blood into the veins of the limb, di&s;tending them as when we tye an arm up for bleeding.</P>
<P>When the wound is in any part of the thigh a handker|chief mu&s;t be firmly knoted round the limb, between the place of the wound and the body; and mu&s;t be twitched with a &s;tick as before directed. But &s;hould the wound be &s;o high up as to leave no room for tying the handkerchief above it, a firm pre&s;&s;ure mu&s;t be made, with the hand, on that part of the groin where the watch lies when the wound is of the right thigh, and on the left groin when the wound is of the left thigh.</P>
<P>If an artery in the hand or arm is pouring out blood, we &s;top it by ca&s;ting a knot in a handkerchief, placing the knot on any part of that &s;ide of the arm which is next the body between the elbow and armpit, tying it round, and twitch|ing it with a &s;tick as in wounds of the leg. And here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in dangerous bleedings, from wounds of the limbs, there is neither time nor nece&s;&s;ity for &s;tripping the part we apply the ligature to; for there is no doubt of lives having been lo&s;t by attempts to undre&s;s the limb when an expeditious appheation of the handkerchief above the cloaths, but higher up than the wound, might have &s;aved them.</P>
<P>In wounds of the head or trunk of the body we command the bleeding by pre&s;&s;ing firmly with our &s;ingers on that border of the wound the blood &s;prings from; and when we cannot determine which &s;ide the blood comes from, we pre&s;s one &s;ide after another till we &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, which it is every man's duty to be ac|quainted with, the mo&s;t violent bleeding may be &s;topped for
<PB N="7" REF="7">&s;ome time; and where a &s;urgeon can be had no more &s;hould be attempted. But when it unfortunately happens that the wound is received at &s;ea, or where no &s;urgical a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be obtained, a manly re&s;olution mu&s;t be put on to &s;ave the &s;ufferer's life, which it is hoped the following directions will a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>A temporary &s;top being put to the bleeding by one or other of the forementioned methods, the wound &s;hould be cleared of clotted blood, or whatever el&s;e may happen to &s;tick to it, by wa&s;hing it gently with a &s;ponge and milk|warm water. It &s;hould next be dried, and the pre&s;&s;ure re|moved from the artery, by rai&s;ing the finger, in ca&s;es of wounds of the head or body, and by untwi&s;ting the &s;tick of the handkerchief or tourniquet in wounds of the limbs, in order that the flow of blood may direct us to the mouth of the wounded artery. We now take notice of the place the blood &s;prings from, and immediately renew the pre&s;&s;ure by the fingers or twitch; and by again wa&s;hing the &s;ore en|deavour to find the opening, which will &s;eldom be difficult when the wound is large and open, and the artery of any con&s;equence. If the blood proceeds from a wound in the &s;ide of an artery, the wounded part of it may be rai&s;ed up by means of a large needle, &s;o as to allow a piece of double waxed thread to be pa&s;&s;ed under it on the &s;ide next the heart, and firmly tied round the artery, taking care to leave the ends of the thread &s;o long as to hang quite out of the wound.&mdash;The &s;ame &s;hould be done on the other end of the opening if the artery is large. But when an artery is quite cut in two, the ends &s;oon &s;hrink among&s;t the fle&s;h, &s;o that the bleeding is &s;ometimes &s;topped in both of them; almo&s;t always in that mo&s;t di&s;tant from the heart; for then no blood pa&s;&s;es into it but by &s;mall branches between it and the other arteries of the limb.</P>
<P>For the mo&s;t part, however, the upper end in large arteries, continues to throw out dangerous quantities of blood, which we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;top by drawing it out with a needle, and tying it firmly with a double waxed thread.</P>
<P>When the end of a limb is carried away by a cannon ball the bleeding is &s;eldom very alarming, for even large arteries are, in that ca&s;e, clo&s;ed up by the brui&s;ed parts. But we
<PB N="8" REF="8">&s;hould not entirely depend upon this, as the larger ones gene|rally break out again in a &s;hort time when we are not aware of it, and &s;o prove fatal. We are, therefore, to put the twitch round the limb, but without tighteaing it, to wa&s;h away the clotted blood with a &s;ponge and warm water, in order to di&s;cover the end of the artery, that it may be tied as before directed.</P>
<P>This method of &s;ecuring wounded arteries is certainly the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t when it can be followed; but ca&s;es may occur where, either from want of courage, or of dexterity, it does not an&s;wer; in the&s;e recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the following:</P>
<P>Having di&s;covered, by the means already de&s;cribed, the mouth of the bleeding artery, or at lea&s;t the part of the wound in which it is &s;ituated, we pre&s;s a piece of &s;ponge of a convenient &s;ize firmly upon it; over this we lay a piece of &s;craped lint, folded up and dipped in Turlington's Bal&s;am, and then &s;ome pieces of linen rag, folded up as if for bleed|ing, each a little larger than that laid on before it, till a pile is rai&s;ed an inch or two above the edges of the wound according to the &s;ize of the wound; binding the whole firmly down with a bandage of linen about three inches broad, and &s;o long as to cover the limb with two or three plies, extending at lea&s;t four inches each way from the wound.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferer mu&s;t now be laid in bed, in &s;uch a manner that the wounded part may lie ea&s;y and undi&s;turbed, and not too much covered with bedeloaths. Nor where the wounded artery is large mu&s;t the handkerchief be removed from the upper part of the limb for three or four days; nor mu&s;t the patient be left alone during that period for any length of time, &s;ince &s;tartings of the part, or many other cau&s;es, may give ri&s;e to repeated bleedings, which might be prevented from proving fatal by immediately tightening the handkerchief or tourniquet. In this &s;tate the wound mu&s;t remain for the &s;pace of four or five days, or until the dre&s;&s;ings are loo&s;ened by the formation of matter, when it mu&s;t be managed in the &s;ame manner as other wounds with lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance, which we &s;hall fully de&s;cribe under the next head.</P>

<HEAD>TREATMENT OF WOUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have confined our&s;elves to the means of &s;topping the di&s;charge of blood from wounded arteries, we are next to con&s;ider the mo&s;t proper mode of dre&s;&s;ing every variety of wounds; and for the &s;ake of method begin with tho&s;e mo&s;t ea&s;y of cure.</P>
<P>Of this kind are clean fle&s;h-wounds running in the direc|tion of the limbs on which they are &s;ituated; for here we can avail our&s;elves of the di&s;po&s;ition which the edges of &s;uch wounds have to grow together when they touch each other con&s;tantly, by what is called adhe&s;ive inflammation, and by which the healing of a con&s;iderable wound will &s;ometimes be effected in three or four days, &s;o as to require no farther care than avoiding &s;uch accidents as might tear it open again before the part regains its &s;trength.</P>
<P>In every clean wound therefore where there is no bleeding artery, or where we have been able to tye it, as this method is admi&s;&s;ible recour&s;e &s;hould be had to it. The fir&s;t thing to be done is to make the wound as clean as po&s;&s;ible by means of a &s;ponge and warm water; and having ab&s;orbed as much as we can of the blood from its &s;urface, the &s;urrounding &s;kin mu&s;t be dried with a cloth, and whil&s;t another per&s;on holds the edges of the wound nicely and clo&s;ely together with his fingers, but &s;o as to be out of our way, &s;trips of &s;ticking plai&s;ter, from three to &s;ix inches in length, and from a quarter to half an inch in breadth, are to be laid right acro&s;s the wound, a &s;traw's breadth di&s;tant from each other; warming them as they are applied, to make them &s;tick more readily, and carefully drying the &s;kin wherever the lea&s;t moi&s;ture appears.</P>
<P>If an artery has been tied in the wound the ends of the thread mu&s;t he brought out at that edge they are neare&s;t to, and &s;hould be left of &s;uch a length as to reach an inch beyond it, when the wound mu&s;t be clo&s;ed, and the &s;trips of plai&s;ter applied as before. And here it may be u&s;eful to ob&s;erve that the per&s;on who a&s;&s;i&s;ts us &s;hould lay his &s;ingers on the &s;trips as we proceed to &s;ecure them more effectually. The
<PB N="10" REF="10">tract of the wound mu&s;t now be covered with a piece of &s;eraped lint, and over this we mu&s;t lay a piece of the &s;ame thinly &s;pread with <HI>cerate,</HI> and &s;o large as to reach half an inch in every direction beyond the fir&s;t piece. And la&s;tly, this dre&s;&s;ing mu&s;t be &s;ecured by binding the part neatly up with a linen bandage, reaching a hand's-breadth each way from the wound. The wound being thus dre&s;&s;ed it mu&s;t be kept quite ea&s;y and unmoved till the fourth day, when the bandage mu&s;t be cantiou&s;ly unfolded, &s;oftening it with a &s;ponge and warm water if it is glued together with the blood. The lint mu&s;t be next removed, and if there are threads hanging out from tied arteries they may be very gently drawn; but if they are not di&s;po&s;ed to come away ea&s;ily they mu&s;t not be forced, but tried at each fature dre&s;&s;ing till they are quite loo&s;e. After examining the threads, the &s;ticking plai&s;ters mu&s;t be removed; and having gently wiped away any matter that may be found on the &s;ore, or on the adjoining &s;kin, they may be renewed but in le&s;s number, and al&s;o the lint, the lint &s;pread with cerate, and the handage. This mode of dre&s;&s;ing mu&s;t be repeated daily, and continued &s;o long as the threads remain, any matter appears on the wound, or its edges continue tender; but when the&s;e appearances cea&s;e, allowing the &s;ame dre&s;&s;ing to remain, a few days will com|plete the cure.</P>
<P>We have dwelt particularly on this mode of curing wounds, as it is the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory in its con&s;equences, the mo&s;t de&s;irable when ever it can be u&s;ed, and may &s;erve as a model for &s;ome part of the treatment of the de&s;cription of wounds we are next to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Wherever there is a lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance in wounds, or where there is &s;uch a vacancy left between the &s;ides of the wound, by the &s;hrinking of the divided &s;kin and fle&s;h, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible to keep them together by &s;trips of &s;ticking plai&s;ter or bandages, a di&s;&s;erent and much more tedious method of cure alone remains for us. A brui&s;ed or ragged wound, or one we have been obliged to &s;ill with &s;craped lint, &s;ponge, &amp;c. for re&s;training the di&s;charge of blood mu&s;t be treated exactly in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<P>The proce&s;s which nature follows in the repair of the&s;e injuries is admirable, and mu&s;t be attended to before we can manage the treatment of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in wounds who&s;e edges are le&s;t open is, that the &s;urface of the wound is in every in&s;tance thrown off by the formation of matter under it. Sometimes this &s;urface is &s;o thin as almo&s;t to e&s;cape no|tice; at others thick, and is then called a &s;lough or &s;it|fa&s;t. And where much violence has been done to the &s;tructure of the part by a brui&s;e, or where the habit of body is faulty, the &s;lough is &s;ometimes of a very &s;erious &s;ize as happens in ca&s;es of gangrene. The colour of &s;loughs varies with their degree of importance; the &s;light ones, when they are not tinged with blood, are of a buff dolour; the more &s;erious ones are a&s;h coloured, mixed here and there with black, brown, green, and yellow. No &s;ooner are the&s;e &s;loughs di&s;charged than the matter becomes cream|coloured and thick; the &s;urface of the fore looks red and clean; the cavity of the wound gradually fills up with tender granulations, or now fle&s;h, to the level of the adjoining &s;kin; and la&s;tly, a thin rind begins to form round the edges, which extending inwards, becomes the future &s;kin.</P>
<P>Having taken this &s;light view of the healing proce&s;s, in wounds who&s;e edges are left open, we are prepared to enter upon their treatment. Clean wounds of this kind mu&s;t be filled lightly with &s;craped lint; ragged or brui&s;ed ones with the &s;ame dipped in Turlington's Bal&s;am. Over this a pledgit of ba&s;ilicon, &s;pread upon &s;ine tow, mu&s;t be laid, and then a nice bol&s;ter of tow, binding the whole on with a ban|dage. In this &s;tate the part mu&s;t remain till the fourth day, when the matter generally loo&s;ens the dre&s;&s;ings &s;o as to make their removal ea&s;y. At this time we take away all that is loo&s;e, or can be rendered &s;o by moi&s;tening with warm milk and water; but clip off the ends of tho&s;e pieces of lint that &s;till &s;tick to the &s;ore. We lay on a little fre&s;h lint, renew the plai&s;ter, bol&s;ter of tow and bandage, and change this dre&s;&s;ing daily, gently wiping the edges of the &s;ore with a piece of tow, to remove any &s;uperfluous matter, and taking care not to cram it with the lint. And when the cavity is filled up we mu&s;t change the ba&s;ilicon pledgit for one of
<PB N="12" REF="12">cerate, covering the &s;urface with a &s;ingle piece of lint rather larger than the &s;ore, and laid with its &s;ofte&s;t &s;ide downwards, &s;till dre&s;&s;ing once a-day till the cure is complete.</P>
<P>When a wound is attended with a high degree of inflam|mation and &s;welling, or its edges are hard and projecting, white bread poultices mu&s;t be applied once or twice a day above the pledgit in&s;tead of the bol&s;ter and bandage, and in that ca&s;e the patient may take a cooling purge, &s;uch as &s;alts.</P>
<P>But when, on the other band, the &s;urface of the &s;kin around the &s;ore looks flabby and &s;oft, is covered with bli&s;ters, or the &s;loughs are thick and ill coloured, the di&s;charge thin, dark, and very offen&s;ive to the &s;mell, the bark mu&s;t be given freely in the manner directed under that article in the di|rections. Towards the conclu&s;ion of the cure of &s;ores the new granulations &s;ometimes ri&s;e above the &s;urface of the &s;ound &s;kin, forming what is called fungous, or proud fle&s;h, this may be kept down by touching it occa&s;ionally with a piece of wetted blue vitriol, which will in &s;uch a ca&s;e amazingly ha&s;ten the healing.</P>
<P>Balls, &s;plinters of wood, bone, or gla&s;s, pieces of the cloaths, or any kind of extraneous &s;ub&s;tance found in a wound, mu&s;t be immediately removed if that can be done by gentle means, as they for the mo&s;t part ab&s;olutely prevent the cure, and are often productive of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and dangerous con|&s;equences. But where their removal is difficult they mu&s;t be &s;uffered to remain till they are loo&s;ened by the dige&s;tion of the wound, or till the ca&s;e comes under the management of a &s;kilful &s;urgeon, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the&s;e few directions are never de&s;igned to &s;uper&s;ede.</P>

<HEAD>SCALDS AND BURNS.</HEAD>
<P>SLIGHT &s;calds may be &s;meared three or four times a-day with a mixture of three &s;poonfuls of olive oil, one o|cerate, and thirty drops of Goulard's Extract, and covered with a piece of &s;oft rag moi&s;tened with the &s;ame. If a few &s;mall bli&s;ters &s;hould ri&s;e do not di&s;turb them for a day or two, when the pain and inflammation will probably be

<HEAD>APPARENT DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;tances of apparent death mo&s;t frequently met with, and which come mo&s;t within the plan of this work, are tho&s;e ari&s;ing from drowning, hanging, exce&s;&s;ive drinking, or breathing air which is unfit for the purpo&s;es of animal life, by being impregnated with noxious parti|cles, as by charcoal burning in a clo&s;e place, the vapour from &s;ulphur, mine damps, &amp;c. As in&s;tances of this kind from one or other of the&s;e cau&s;es are frequently occuring, we &s;hall endeavour to give &s;ome general remarks on each head.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>DROWNING.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a body is taken out of the water apparently dead there are two material objects to which our attention mu&s;t be immediately turned, viz. to re&s;tore breath|ing, and to keep up or bring back a natural degree of warmth. To effect the&s;e important purpo&s;es, after the body has been &s;tripped and laid upon a bed, with the head and &s;houlders a little rai&s;ed, we mu&s;t "put the pipe of a pair of bellows into one of the no&s;trils, the other no&s;tril and the mouth being clo&s;ed by an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and blow gently till the brea&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little rai&s;ed. Let the mouth and no&s;tril then be left fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and an ea&s;y pre&s;&s;ure be made upon the brea&s;t. Repeat thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imitation of natural breathing, at &s;hort intervals, for an hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or longer. If no bellows be at hand, let an a&s;&s;i&s;tant blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> into the no&s;trils of the drowned per&s;on with his brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through a quill, reed, or any other &s;mall pipe."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e attempts are making other a&s;&s;i&s;tants may "dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the body completely with warm cloths, and afterwards ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it diligently, but gently, with hot flannels on the left &s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> near the heart.

<P>The&s;e efforts mu&s;t be continued for at lea&s;t two hours, as there have been in&s;tances of recovery after a length of time has pa&s;t without any appearance of reanimation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>HANGING.</HEAD>
<P>HANGING occa&s;ions death by compre&s;&s;ing the wind|pipe, and con&s;equently &s;topping the breathing, and ob&s;tructing the return of the blood to the heart by the jugular veins. If the unhappy per&s;on is di&s;covered whil&s;t the body is &s;till warm and pliable there are generally &s;ome hopes of recovery; and as apparent death has been occa&s;ion|ed principally by the breathing being &s;topped, the method of attempting recovery is clearly pointed out. We mu&s;t endeavour to re&s;tore the breathing as quickly as po&s;&s;ible in the &s;ame manner as directed in ca&s;es of drowning.</P>
<P>Should any per&s;on be pre&s;ent who under&s;tands bleeding, the patient may be bled to the extent of a tea-cup full, more or le&s;s according to his &s;trength, or a cupping gla&s;s may be applied to the neck. Should it happen that none pre&s;ent will attempt bleeding &s;ome pains mu&s;t be taken to le&s;&s;en the quantity of blood collected in the head and neck, by keep|ing the body almo&s;t upright. Attention mu&s;t be paid to prevent the patient becoming cold, or if already cold, to re&s;tore the natural warmth by means directed under the article drowning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EXCESSIVE DRINKING.</HEAD>
<P>THE effects of exce&s;&s;ive drinking are frequently &s;atal, from little or no attention being paid to the unfor|tunate, and frequently helple&s;s object. The vulgar notion, <HI>that nothing can hurt a drunken man,</HI> has been the lo&s;s of many
<PB N="16" REF="16">a life. From this erroneous opinion, when a per&s;on is be|come what is termed dead drunk, he is &s;uffered to tumble and roll about almo&s;t without notice. He is then in the greate&s;t danger. The quantity which he has drank generally begets an inclination to vomit; in attempting which, he gets his head over the &s;ide of the bed, or into &s;ome other po&s;ition, with his head downwards, and not being attended 10, that &s;ituation, added to the tightne&s;s of his &s;hirt-neck or neckcloth, produces &s;uffocation; and we have &s;een many in&s;tances where the unhappy per&s;on has been found next morning quite dead.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations it will appear evident how ne|ce&s;&s;ary it is to pay &s;ome attention to people in this condition. The fir&s;t &s;tep &s;hould be to loo&s;en the neckcloth, &s;hirt-neck, night-cap &s;trings, or any thing which is about the neck, and to place the body in a &s;uitable po&s;ition. The be&s;t po&s;ition is laying, with the head and &s;houlders rai&s;ed; if the patient is &s;uffered to &s;it there is a danger of his head hanging down too much upon his brea&s;t, by which the circulation of the blood in the neck is ob&s;tructed, and an apoplectic &s;tate is brought on.</P>
<P>During the time that he is &s;o extremely drunk he mu&s;t not be left alone le&s;t be tumble out of bed in his &s;truggling. If notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions he &s;hould &s;en&s;ibly be|come cold, and appear to be growing wor&s;e, a cly&s;ter may be given without delay, compo&s;ed equal parts of wine and hot water, with a &s;mall table &s;poonful of flour of mu&s;tard, or a tea &s;poonful of powdered ginger or pepper. Rum, brandy, or gin, mixed with &s;ix times its quantity of hot water, with the addition of mu&s;tard, &amp;c. may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of wine. To keep up a proper degree of warmth the &s;ame means mu&s;t be u&s;ed as directed under the article drowning.</P>
<P>The exce&s;&s;ive degree of thir&s;t occa&s;ioned by drinking &s;trong liquors often induce people to quench it by taking what is hurtful. The &s;afe&s;t drink after a debauch is water with a toa&s;t, barley water, or tea.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive drinking is a failing we cannot &s;ufficiently con|demn. Of its effects we can hardly &s;ay too much; as it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what are the con&s;equences which ari&s;e from it not only to the individual him&s;elf but to the community
<PB N="17" REF="17">at large. A per&s;on who gives him&s;elf up to hard drinking greatly hazards his own exi&s;tence, and renders him&s;elf inca|pable of fulfilling the duties of his &s;tation in life. If he is in a &s;ituation of tru&s;t he ill merits the confedence repo&s;ed in him. If a &s;ea-faring par&s;on &s;uch a conduct is more e&s;pe|cially blameable, as the &s;ucce&s;s of his voyage is thereby ren|dered precarious, and the property of his employers, and the lives and &s;afety of tho&s;e under him, are frequently expo&s;ed through his mi&s;conduct to imminent peril.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>NOXIOUS VAPOURS AND LIGHTNING.</HEAD>
<P>IT frequently happens that in ea&s;es of apparent death from noxious vapours, or being &s;truck down by lightning, if the per&s;on is di&s;covered &s;oon, that the heat of the body is even greater than that of a living per&s;on. In this ca&s;e good effects have been ob&s;erved from da&s;hing the face and the whole body with cold water, thrown in &s;mall quantities, and with &s;ome force. The effect will be &s;till greater if the body be dried at intervals, and then the &s;prinkling repeated.</P>
<P>Every thing mu&s;t be removed from the neck, and pains mu&s;t be taken to le&s;&s;en the quantity of blood collected in the head by the means recommended under the article hanging. But if the body in&s;tead of being warmer than natural &s;hould feel cold, or &s;hould be gradually turning colder, warmth mu&s;t be kept up by the means already directed under the article drowning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EXPOSURE TO EXTREME COLD.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the effects of long expo&s;ure to &s;evere cold in &s;leepine&s;s; this is produced by the cold gradually ex|tingui&s;hing the vital principle. In ca&s;es of &s;hipwreck, and in very &s;evere winters, it will &s;ometimes happen that people are expo&s;ed for &s;uch a length of time as to produce the effect we have ju&s;t mentioned; every exertion &s;hould then be made
<PB N="18" REF="18">to keep awake, as there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that death might be the con&s;equence of falling a-&s;leep at &s;uch a time. A body found apparently dead from this cau&s;e mu&s;t be treated with the greate&s;t caution. It would appear mo&s;t eligible to many to attempt the re&s;toration of life by the immediate applica|tion of warmth; but experience has proved this to be an erroneous and dangerous mode of proceeding. The body mu&s;t be got into a hou&s;e as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, but not near the fire, and rubbed for a length of time with cold cloths, after which warmth and breathing may be gradually attempt|ed in the manner already directed.</P>

<P>SPIRIT OF HARTSHO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.&mdash;U&s;eful in headachs and faint|ings; it may be held to the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, or a feather dipped in it may be put up the no&s;tril. Half a tea &s;poonful of it may be mixed with half a cup of water, and taken in faintings and fits. One table &s;poonful of it and two of olive oil, well mixed, by &s;haking them together in a hottle, make a lintment very u&s;eful for rubbing on parts &s;welled from rheumati&s;m, for &s;ore throats, or &s;wellings of the face from expo&s;ure to &s;evere cold, and for &s;prains where there is no unu&s;ual heat or inflam|mation. The part &s;hould be rubbed three or four times a day, and covered with flannel.</P>
<P>SPIRIT OF NITRE.&mdash;Six tea &s;poonfuls of this and one of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn may be mixed, and a tea &s;poonful taken in a little barley water every three hours where &s;weating is required. Its effect will be greatly promoted by drinking freely of barley water, thin gruel, or balm tea.</P>
<P>BASILIGON OINTMENT.&mdash;U&s;eful in the fir&s;t &s;tage of every wound who&s;e edges cannot be brought together. It pro|motes the formation of good matter, which may be known by its being thick and of a crean, colour. It is the mo&s;t proper dre&s;&s;ing for boils and collections of matter after they bur&s;t. As we have already had occa&s;ion to allude to the u&s;e of this article in the treatment of wounds we con&s;ider it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more in this place.</P>
<P>CERATE.&mdash;A very proper dre&s;&s;ing for &s;uch &s;light hurts as con&s;i&s;t only of a lo&s;s of &s;kin. Al&s;o in burns and &s;ealds. This article is al&s;o alluded to in the treatment of wounds, which &s;ee.</P>

The belly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould have large pieces of woollen cloth, wrung out of hot water as hot as the hands can well manage, applied to it, and renewed as fa&s;t as they cool for the &s;pace of a quarter of in hour at a time, and repeated occa&s;ionally.
