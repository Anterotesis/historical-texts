<HEAD>SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE PLAGUE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS to the <HI>Original</HI> of this dire|ful Scourge of Mankind call'd the <HI>Plague,</HI> I find the mo&s;t learned <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> are much divided in their <HI>O|pinions</HI> concerning it, and tho&s;e who have &s;earched ve|ry far into the Secrets of <HI>Nature</HI> do yet ingenuou&s;ly acknowledge them&s;elves to be very much at a lo&s;s about it. The great Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> freely and ful|ly confe&s;&s;es his <HI>own</HI> and his <HI>Brethren's</HI> Ignorance in this Matter, and that not without a <HI>Smart</HI> Re|flection upon &s;uch as pretend to know more than their Neighbours, in this and other Particulars of the &s;ame ab&s;tru&s;e Nature. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 2 d. <HI>Page</HI> 71. of his Works, he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf. <HI>At ver&ograve; quae, quali&s;que &s;it, illa aeris Di&s;po&s;itio &agrave; qu&acirc; mor|bificus hic apparatus promanat, nos, pariter ac com|plura alia circa quae vecors ac arrogans Philo&s;o|phantium
<PB N="2" REF="5">turbanugatur, plan&egrave; ignoramus.</HI> Words &s;o <HI>&s;evere</HI> and &s;o <HI>di&s;couraging</HI> to any <HI>Enquiries</HI> of this Kind, that I &s;hall chu&s;e to leave them as I find them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here indeed freely own that I am much plea&s;ed with the <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity</HI> of the lear|ned and diligent <HI>Diemerbroeck,</HI> who after a large Recital and Examination of the &s;everal <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> that had been advanced before his Time concern|ing the Origine of the <HI>Plague,</HI> and after weighing the Arguments and Rea&s;ons brought by their re|&s;pective Patrons for the Support of them, declares him&s;elf wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with them all, in the eight Chapter of his fir&s;t Book and the Annotations there|on; and after all, he has Recour&s;e to the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the great <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> (the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Phy|&s;icians,</HI>) and endeavours to make it appear that &s;omething &s;upernatural or preternatural is to be un|der&s;tood thereby, and that <HI>That</HI> ancient <HI>Sage</HI> (tho' guided only by the Light of natural Rea&s;on) inten|ded to &s;ignifie by that Term, &s;omewhat &s;ent down from angry <HI>Heaven,</HI> as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment for the Wickedne&s;s of Men.</P>
<P>But it may not be improper to add &s;omething un|der this <HI>Head</HI> from that great <HI>Chri&s;tian Philo&s;o|pher,</HI> and (while he lived) illu&s;trious <HI>Ornament</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> never to be men|tioned without a Preface of Honour. This <HI>Curi|ous</HI> and <HI>Critical,</HI> but <HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;t</HI> Enquirer into the Powers of <HI>Nature,</HI> and Operations of <HI>Se|cond Cau&s;es,</HI> in his Occa&s;ional Di&s;qui&s;ition concer|ning the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Plague,</HI> wi&s;ely chu&s;es the middle Way, between tho&s;e who recur wholly to &s;upernatural <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> and tho&s;e who impute all to na|tural <HI>Ones,</HI> in their Accounts hereof: He ob&s;erves,
<PB N="3" REF="6">in his <HI>Experimental Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> concerning the <HI>In|&s;alubrity</HI> and <HI>Salubrity</HI> of the <HI>Air, Page</HI> 50. &amp;c. That the <HI>Sacred Writings</HI> expre&s;ly teach that &s;ome <HI>Plagues</HI> have been in an extraordinary Manner in|flicted by <HI>God,</HI> particularly <HI>That</HI> which in <HI>David's</HI> Time &s;wept away in three Days <HI>Seventy Thou&s;and</HI> Men. But <HI>He</HI> &s;eems to think that it is carrying the Matter too far to infer from hence, or to affirm po|&s;itively that <HI>All</HI> are &s;o. <HI>I have &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pect|ed</HI> (&s;ays he, Page 52.) <HI>that in the Controver&s;ie concerning the Origine of the Plague whether it be Natural or Supernatural, neither of the contend|ing Parties is altogether in the Right, &s;ince 'tis very po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome Pe&s;tilences may not break forth without an extraordinary Interpo&s;ition of Almighty God, provoked by the Sins of Men; and yet other Plagues may be produced by a tragical Con|cour&s;e of merely natural Cau&s;es.</HI> But we are not to think that by this la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion <HI>He</HI> meant to exclude the Superior Agency or Superintendency of the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> in any <HI>Ca&s;e;</HI> for no <HI>Man</HI> can expre&s;s a more becoming and awful Sen&s;e of, or an higher Reverence for the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> than <HI>this</HI> great <HI>Genius</HI> does in all his Writings; and I could heartily wi&s;h that <HI>He</HI> were more generally imitated herein by the <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> of the pre&s;ent <HI>Age,</HI> and that a more explicit Reference to <HI>Divine Providence</HI> were to be found in all their Re&s;earches into <HI>Nature:</HI> And I cannot but hope that it would very much contri|bute hereunto, if our Modern <HI>Wits</HI> would &s;eri|ou&s;ly read and con&s;ider that excellent <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> cal|led the <HI>Chri&s;tian Virtuo&s;o,</HI> written by this <HI>Noble Author.</HI> But to return from this (I hope not un|u&s;eful) <HI>Digre&s;&s;ion:</HI> As to Mr. <HI>Boyle's</HI> Opinion concerning the Ri&s;e of <HI>Ordinary Plagues,</HI> it is in
<PB N="4" REF="7">&s;hort <HI>This: He</HI> inclines to think that the <HI>Malig|nant Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> whereby the <HI>Plague</HI> is propagated, if not fir&s;t produced, is imputable to &s;ome Kind of <HI>Subterraneal Expirations,</HI> and par|ticularly to <HI>Ar&s;enical Fumes;</HI> but as to this <HI>He</HI> is far from being Po&s;itive, or Dogmatical: What <HI>He</HI> offers to render this Conjecture probable, they that plea&s;e may &s;ee, in his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> as to its Unhealthfulne&s;s or Healthfulne&s;s, already men|tioned. Thus far as to the <HI>Origine</HI> of the <HI>Plague.</HI></P>
<P>What the Learned Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> advances, about the Beginning of <HI>Page</HI> 4. of his Di&s;cour&s;e, in the&s;e Words; <HI>[Nor do I think that in this I&s;land particularly, there is any one In&s;tance of a Pe&s;tilential Di&s;ea&s;e among us of great Con&s;equence, which we did not receive from other Iufected Places:]</HI> is perfectly agrecable to the Opinion of the celebrated <HI>Syden|ham,</HI> who ob&s;erves, that to the evil Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Air,</HI> which proceeds (according to <HI>Him</HI>) from a latent unknown <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> there mu&s;t be joyned the Reception of &s;ome <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Infection</HI> flowing from &s;ome <HI>Plaguy</HI> Body, and received either <HI>immediately</HI> by a near Approximation to it, or el&s;e <HI>mediately</HI> by the Means of &s;ome <HI>Fomes</HI> tran&s;mitted thencefrom into &s;omething apt to receive and retain the &s;ame, and transferred therewith to di&s;tant Places; until by the great Number of infected Bodies, the <HI>Air</HI> receives &s;uch a <HI>Taint,</HI> [or rather is &s;o charged and loaded with <HI>Poi&s;onous Particles</HI>] as &s;uffices to pro|pagate the <HI>Contagion</HI> to &s;ome Di&s;tance, without any other Spark to kindle the &s;preading Fire. The Sub|&s;tance of this may be &s;een in <HI>Page</HI> 72. of his Works.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 7. the <HI>Doctor</HI> briefly mentions that mo&s;t terrible <HI>Plague</HI> which carried <HI>Death</HI> over the greate&s;t Part of the then known <HI>World,</HI> about the
<PB N="5" REF="8">Middle of the fourteenth <HI>Century,</HI> the Hi&s;tory of which being very remarkable (e&s;pecially if all the Circum&s;tances related by <HI>Authors</HI> of con&s;iderable Note be true) I &s;hall pre&s;ent the Reader with a &s;omewhat larger <HI>Narrative</HI> of it, as very proper to affect us with a pious Awe and Fear of the Wrath and Vengeance of a righteous <HI>God,</HI> and al&s;o to give us a melancholy and humbling Repre&s;entation of the horrid <HI>Degeneracy</HI> of humane Nature, and the de&s;|perate Ob&s;tinacy of irreclaimably <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> in <HI>Page</HI> 69. of the forementioned Di&s;|cour&s;e has given a brief Account of this prodigious <HI>Pe&s;tilence,</HI> from that excellent French Hi&s;torian <HI>Mou&s;ieur de Mezeray,</HI> who (as he tells us) relates in the Life of <HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> that the <HI>Plague</HI> which happened in <HI>France</HI> in the Year 1346, was &s;o Contagious and De&s;tructive, that &s;carce a Village or even a Hou&s;e e&s;caped uninfected by it: <HI>He</HI> adds, that this <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> began two Years before in the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> by a Vapour that was mo&s;t horribly &s;tinking, which brake out of the Earth like a Kind of <HI>Subterraneal Fire;</HI> and devoured above 200 Leagues of that Country, even to the very Trees and Stones, and infected the <HI>Air</HI> in a wonderful Manner: From <HI>Cathay</HI> (&s;ays he) it pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> thence into <HI>Africa,</HI> afterwards into <HI>Europe,</HI> which it ran&s;ack'd throughout. Thus far Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> from <HI>Mezeray,</HI> in who&s;e Account the Date of the Year &s;eems to have been mi&s;taken, or 1346 mi&s;printed for 1348, or 1349. For by Dr. <HI>Mead</HI>'s and the following Account, it began in <HI>Ca|thay,</HI> (the Northern Part of <HI>China</HI>) in 1346.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I have quoted from Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> I &s;hall entertain the Reader with a more Circum&s;tan|tial Relation of this mo&s;t fearful Calamity which I
<PB N="6" REF="9">met in <HI>Kircher's Chronology</HI> of the mo&s;t remarka|ble <HI>Plagues</HI> that are recorded in <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> annexed to his <HI>Scrutinium Phy&s;ico-Medicum contagio&s;ae Lu|is, quae Pe&s;tis dicitur.</HI> The <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of what he writes is this; That in the <HI>Poutificate</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth being <HI>Emperor,</HI> there raged a mo&s;t cruel <HI>Pe&s;tilence,</HI> the wor&s;t that ever was, &s;carcely the third Part of Mortals being left alive. It &s;o prevailed every where, that <HI>God</HI> &s;eemed as if he would de&s;troy all Mankind by a general Ru|ine, as of old in the univer&s;al <HI>Deluge. Villanius</HI> tells us that it had its fir&s;t Ri&s;e in the <HI>&V;pper A&s;ia,</HI> and particularly in the Kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> in the Year 1346, from a mo&s;t filthy Smell &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from a certain <HI>Fiery Body,</HI> which either fell from <HI>Heaven,</HI> or broke out of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and extended its horrible and terrifying <HI>Bulk</HI> to &s;o va&s;t a Compa&s;s, that it con&s;umed every thing that &s;tood in its Way, Animals, Hou&s;es, Trees, &amp;c. for the Space of fifteen Days Journey: And &s;ome mo&s;t filthy lit|tle <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> furni&s;hed with Feet and Tails, [by this De&s;cription they &s;eem to have been a Sort of <HI>Neuts</HI> or <HI>Lizards</HI>] as al&s;o <HI>Worms,</HI> and a &s;mall Sort of <HI>Snakes</HI> in a numberle&s;s Multitude, fell at the &s;ame Time from the Air upon the Earth, the Stench and Putrefaction whereof infected the whole <HI>Region.</HI> A <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> hence ari&s;ing invaded the adjacent Pla|ces, and then &s;pread it &s;elf to the remoter Cities and Provinces, &s;o that it depopulated all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> After|wards it penetrated into <HI>Egypt, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Thence it pa&s;&s;ed over into <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>En|gland,</HI> and at length into <HI>Germany, Poland</HI> and all the <HI>Northern Parts,</HI> with the De&s;truction of innu|merable Per&s;ons. In the City of <HI>Florence</HI> only, <HI>Villanius</HI> &s;ays there peri&s;hed 60000, but St. <HI>An|thony</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10">makes them 100000; and although &s;uch a dreadful <HI>Contagion</HI> was &s;ent among Men by the a|venging Hand of <HI>God</HI> for their enormous Wicked|ne&s;s, yet after &s;o great a Calamity tho&s;e that &s;uc|ceeded and came greedily into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch rich Inheritances as the decea&s;ed had left, grew wor&s;e and more wicked than ever. Many Prodigies pre|ceded this <HI>Plague</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;uch as horrible Clefts, or &s;wallowing Gulfs in the Earth exhaling a poi|&s;onous Wind or Vapour, and other Things of the like Sort. Thus far <HI>Kircher.</HI> Page 247.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If that Part of the Story be Fact concer|ning the Worms, Snakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are &s;aid to have fallen from the Air, it &s;eems to me much more probable that they were hatch'd from Eggs that had been formerly laid on the Earth, or Leaves of Plants, by Animals and In&s;ects of that Kind; the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Air, which was filled with the Steams of that horrible <HI>Meteor</HI> before mentioned, perhaps greatly contributing to their Generation or quickning in &s;uch va&s;t Numbers.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t fearful <HI>Plague</HI> is al&s;o taken Notice of by many other <HI>Chronologers. Al&s;tedius</HI> relates that at <HI>Lubeck</HI> it carried off 90000. And that of the Bare-footed <HI>Monks</HI> in &s;everal Parts it de&s;troyed &s;o great a Number that in the whole their Dead amoun|ted to 1244434; and the &s;ame Particular is mentio|ned by <HI>Hogelius</HI> in his <HI>Horologium Hi&s;toricum,</HI> Page 632. who tells us al&s;o, that at <HI>Erford</HI> there died &s;uch Multitudes that the burying Places in the City being all fill'd with Carca&s;es, 12000 were laid in eleven Caves under the <HI>Mountain</HI> called the <HI>Red Moun|tain.</HI> Page 650.</P>
<P>Many other de&s;tructive <HI>Pe&s;tilences</HI> before and after this are mentioned by Hi&s;torians, and &s;e|veral
<PB N="8" REF="11">of the later Ones particularly de&s;cribed by Learned Phy&s;icians, as That at <HI>Delft</HI> in 1557 by <HI>Fore&s;tus,</HI> That at <HI>Vicenza</HI> by <HI>Ma&s;&s;aria</HI> in 1576, That at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> in 1636 by <HI>Diemerbroeck,</HI> and the la&s;t very terrible One at <HI>London</HI> in 1665 by <HI>Hodges,</HI> which they that plea&s;e may con&s;ult.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 11. towards the End, the <HI>Learned Au|thor</HI> ju&s;t mentions the Opinion of &s;ome who have thought that the <HI>Pe&s;tilential Contagion</HI> or <HI>Infecti|on</HI> is propagated by the Means of <HI>In&s;ects,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Eggs</HI> may ea&s;ily be conveyed from Place to Place, and produce the Di&s;ea&s;e when they come to be hatched: But he ob&s;erves withal that this is a <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> groun|ded upon no manner of <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> and that there is no Need to have Recour&s;e to it. As to this <HI>Hypothe|&s;is</HI> of poy&s;onous <HI>In&s;ects</HI> giving Ri&s;e to the <HI>Plague,</HI> it has been lately in&s;i&s;ted on by Mr. <HI>Bradley,</HI> who in his <HI>new</HI> (and indeed very ingenious and u&s;eful) <HI>Improvements of Planting and Gardening</HI> Reprin|ted here, has publi&s;hed a Letter from Mr. <HI>Robert Ball</HI> containing &s;everal curicus Ob&s;ervations which &s;eem to him to render it highly probable; and in a &s;mall Tract lately publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Bradley,</HI> the Title of which is, <HI>The Plague at Mar&s;eilles con&s;i|dered,</HI> he has pur&s;ued the &s;ame <HI>Conjecture,</HI> and tran|&s;cribed the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of what is to be found in the <HI>Book</HI> and <HI>Letter</HI> already mentioned upon the Head of <HI>In&s;ects.</HI></P>
<P>This Notion &s;eems to be much a-kin to that which was advanced by <HI>Athana&s;ius Kircher</HI> (that famous <HI>Enquirer</HI> into Nature, &s;ufficiently known to the lear|ned World by his Voluminous Labours) in the for|mer <HI>Century,</HI> and he &s;eems to have taken the Hint from the noted <HI>Cardan,</HI> for in <HI>Page</HI> 52. of his <HI>Scruti|nium Pe&s;tis,</HI> he tells us, that <HI>Cardan</HI> relates that in his
<PB N="9" REF="12">Time (who flouri&s;hed about the Middle of the &s;ix-teenth <HI>Age</HI>) there was a mo&s;t cruel <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> ari&s;ing (as he conjectures) from an infinite Number of little Worms: Of the&s;e <HI>Vermiculi Kir|cher</HI> di&s;cour&s;es very largely in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Plague,</HI> bothbefore and after thenowmention'd Quo|tation from <HI>Cardan;</HI> and particularly in <HI>Page</HI> 141. he &s;peaks of the <HI>Plague</HI> as &s;omething which he had&s;hewn to be <HI>Animated,</HI> becau&s;e of tho&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> which hetakes to be often, if not always, the <HI>Seminary</HI> there|of, concerning which he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf; <HI>Sunt autem hi Vermiculi Pe&s;tis propagatores, tam exigui, tam tenues et &s;ubtiles, ut omnem &s;en&s;&ucirc;s captum cludant;</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of what he &s;ays is this; That the&s;e little <HI>Worms</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the <HI>Spreaders,</HI> if not wholly the <HI>Breeders</HI> of the <HI>Plague,</HI> are &s;o exceeding <HI>Small</HI> that they are to the Sen&s;e and Sight imperceptible and undi&s;cernable, unle&s;s it be by the Help of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite <HI>Micro&s;copes,</HI> and for their Smalne&s;s may be called <HI>Atoms,</HI> but they encrea&s;e &s;o prodigiou&s;ly that their Numbers are beyond Compute.

<P>As for proper <HI>Prophylacticks</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ervatives</HI> from the <HI>Plague,</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI> has not offered much upon this Head, and &s;eems to de&s;pair of the di&s;co|very of any Specifick of vertue &s;ufficient to fortifie nature again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of &s;uch a <HI>Malignant Di|&s;ea&s;e.</HI> After the mention of &s;ome general and very u&s;eful rules to be ob&s;erved by way of prevention, and ju&s;t hinting at a few particulars, e&s;pecially the u&s;e of <HI>Wine Vinegar</HI> in &s;mall quantities, [which, with his <HI>Con&s;erva me Domine,</HI> is &s;aid to have been the <HI>Antidote</HI> of the famous <HI>Sylvius</HI>] <HI>He</HI> does in the 35.

But as to this, I (being no <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> my &s;elf) have little to offer but what has occa&s;ionally occurred to me in peru&s;ing &s;ome of the be&s;t <HI>Medi|cal</HI> Books, written by <HI>Authors</HI> of the greate&s;t Name and Note, who have them&s;elves been emi|nent <HI>Practitioners,</HI> and particularly have had cou|rage enough to Vi&s;it the Sick in places where the <HI>Plague</HI> has raged with the greate&s;t Violence.

Take Con&s;erve of Wood-&s;orrel and Goats Rue, of each half a Pound; of Marigolds, one Pound; London-treacle, three Ounces; Bole Armoniack vitriolated, four Ounces; with Syrup of Lemons as much as is &s;ufficient; make an Electuary; two or three Drams of which may be taken Morning and Evening.</HI> The other is an <HI>Hau&s;tus</HI> &s;aid to be of great Virtue. <HI>Viz. Take Wa|ter of red Ro&s;es camphorated two Ounces, the be&s;t Vinegar one Ounce, in which di&s;&s;olve two Scruples of the be&s;t Bole Armoniack; add three Drams of &s;imple Syrup of Scabious, mix them for a Draught.</HI></P>
<P>I do the rather mention this becau&s;e the U&s;e of <HI>Vinegar</HI> &s;eems to be much approved by the Lear|ned Dr. <HI>Mead. Diemerbroeck</HI> al&s;o highly com|mends <HI>Vinegar,</HI> and &s;ays that he had &s;een many poor People better pre&s;erved by taking a <HI>Spoonful</HI> thereof every Morning, than &s;ome Others were by the mo&s;t co&s;tly <HI>Remedies.</HI> Page 170.</P>
<P>Among other <HI>Antidotes</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Pe&s;tilential Contagion,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> does particularly commend <HI>Canary</HI> of the be&s;t Sort, of which he frequently drank while he attended the Sick, and found it of &s;in|gular
<PB N="21" REF="24">U&s;e to him&s;elf and others. His Time of drink|ing it was at <HI>Dinner,</HI> and a little before <HI>Bed-time;</HI> but as to the <HI>Smoaking</HI> of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which <HI>Diemer|broeck</HI> &s;o much extols, <HI>He</HI> &s;peaks very doubtfully of it, and &s;eems to have had an Aver&s;ion to it, and to &s;u&s;pect that the <HI>Pe&s;tiferous Vapours</HI> may be &s;uck|ed in with the <HI>Smoak;</HI> and in fine he prefers his good <HI>Spani&s;h Wine</HI> very much before it, and this &s;o far as appears was the <HI>Antidote</HI> he chiefly tru&s;ted to among the <HI>Internal</HI> Ones. But then as to <HI>Ex|ternal</HI> Defen&s;atives again&s;t this deadly Enemy (re|jecting the many <HI>Amulets</HI> vulgarly pre&s;cribed, the mo&s;t of which he thinks to be u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;ome noxious,) there is one which he greatly commends as the mo&s;t powerful and effectual of all others in this Ca&s;e, and that is the having of large <HI>I&s;&s;ues;</HI> for In&s;tance, one in the <HI>Left Arm,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Right Leg,</HI> capacious enough to contain five or &s;ix Pea&s;e. The more to enforce this Advice, he does &s;olemnly affirm, <HI>Page</HI> 240. that as oft as he went in|to Places that were more than ordinarily <HI>Infected,</HI> he found that Part of his <HI>Arm</HI> in which the <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> was, exceedingly pained, and that <HI>thin, undige&s;ted, Bloody Matter</HI> would flow from it, with a very &s;mart Pungency, and that upon this Warning given him, he pre&s;ently had Recour&s;e to proper <HI>Alexiphar|micks.</HI> It &s;eems plain from hence even to Sen&s;e and ocular Demon&s;tration, that the <HI>Virus,</HI> the <HI>Venom,</HI> and <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Contagion</HI> did work off in a great Mea&s;ure by Means of this Sort of <HI>Evacuation.</HI> I &s;hall only add under this <HI>Head,</HI> that <HI>Diemerbroeck</HI> does al&s;o much commend this Remedy, and ob&s;erves that many who had <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> e&s;caped the <HI>Plague at Ni|meguen,</HI> and of tho&s;e that had it, a con&s;iderable Num|ber recovered &s;peedily upon taking a <HI>Sweating
<PB N="22" REF="25">Medicine,</HI> and he mentions &s;everal other eminent <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> that had found the happy Effect of &s;uch <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> in the Cour&s;e of their <HI>Practice.</HI> Page 150. <HI>&amp;c. He</HI> ob&s;erves al&s;o that many of tho&s;e that had <HI>Sores</HI> about them e&s;caped the <HI>Plague,</HI> and he tells us that <HI>Galen</HI> of old made the Same <HI>Ob&s;ervati|on.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now in the Clo&s;e of this <HI>Collection</HI> ju&s;t mention <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two Pre&s;ervatives</HI> recorded by the Excellent <HI>Mr. Boyle,</HI> towards the latter end of his di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Air</HI> beforementioned. The former of the&s;e is in Page 86. which was communi|cated to him by one whom he calls an ancient and very experienced <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> to who&s;e care a great <HI>Pe&s;t-hou&s;e</HI> was committed. This <HI>Per&s;on</HI> own'd to Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> that be&s;ides ardent <HI>Prayers</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and a very regular diet, his con&s;tant <HI>Antidote</HI> was on|ly to take every Morning fa&s;ting a little <HI>Sea-Salt</HI> di&s;&s;olved in a few Spoonfuls of <HI>Fair Water:</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> adds that he thinks it de&s;irable that Notice be taken of all Remedies that have been found by good <HI>Trials</HI> available again&s;t the <HI>Plague;</HI> for &s;ince <HI>Pe&s;ti|lences</HI> are various in their Kinds, 'tis very po&s;&s;ible that their appropriated Remedies may be &s;o too; and that Medicine may prove &s;ucce&s;sful in one, which has proved ineffectual in another. The <HI>Noble Au|thor</HI> adds to this, That the &s;aid Con&s;ideration for|bad him to pa&s;s by the following Particular, <HI>Viz.</HI> That a very Learned <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> having recommen|ded to him the Herb called <HI>Galega,</HI> or <HI>Goats-rue,</HI> at that time little noted in <HI>England,</HI> as a mo&s;t effectu|al <HI>Antidote</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Plague,</HI> he cau&s;ed it to be cultivated in a Garden, and when the <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> raged mo&s;t, having &s;ome of it by him made up with a little <HI>Sugar</HI> in the form of a <HI>fine green Con&s;erve,</HI> he
<PB N="23" REF="26">&s;ent it to <HI>Two</HI> infected Per&s;ons, who, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing on it, both of them recovered. He al&s;o takes notice of the great vertue of this <HI>Herb</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Bitings</HI> of <HI>Venomous Creatures:</HI> It may be eaten in its entire Sub&s;tance as a Salad, or the <HI>Con&s;erve</HI> or <HI>Syrup</HI> may be taken, or the <HI>Juice</HI> newly expre&s;s'd, which he thinks better than the <HI>Syrup</HI> or <HI>Con&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have fini&s;hed what I had to offer to the <HI>Publick</HI> concerning the <HI>Plague,</HI> and the mo&s;t proper <HI>Antidotes</HI> again&s;t it which I have met with in my lit|tle reading. I &s;hall only add, That after all, our prin|cipal-Tru&s;t and Confidence mu&s;t be in the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> through the Merits of our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and it great|ly concerns all <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to &s;earch and try their ways, and turn unto the <HI>Lord</HI> with their whole hearts. Let the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>In&s;truments</HI> or <HI>Second Cau&s;es</HI> of this terrible Calamity be what they will; whether it owes its <HI>Origin</HI> to <HI>Subterraneal Steams</HI> and the <HI>Expirations</HI> of Noxious <HI>Minerals,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> conjectures) or, to a pe&s;tiferous <HI>Aura,</HI> proceed|ing from a peculiar, and (in a Sort) corruptive al|teration of the <HI>Nitro-aereal</HI> Spirit, (as Dr. <HI>Hodges</HI> thinks) or, to prodigious <HI>Swarms</HI> of invi&s;ible <HI>Ve|nomous In&s;ects,</HI> (as <HI>Kircher</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bradley</HI> ima|gine) Or <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> to an unhealthy Con&s;titution of the Sea&s;on, and Di&s;order in the <HI>Air</HI> Occa&s;ioned by ex|ce&s;&s;ive <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Moi&s;ture,</HI> (as <HI>Galen</HI> taught of old) which evil Con&s;titution is heightned and ren|dred more Malignant by the Stinks of <HI>Stagnating Waters,</HI> by <HI>Putrid Exhalations</HI> from the <HI>Earth</HI> and from dead <HI>Carca&s;es</HI> lying unburied, which fill the <HI>Air</HI> with <HI>Contagious Particles,</HI> and &s;o being <HI>Suck'd</HI> in with the <HI>Breath</HI> taint in their pa&s;&s;age the <HI>Salival</HI> Juices, which being Swallowed down into
<PB N="24" REF="27">the <HI>Stomach</HI> fix the <HI>Malignity</HI> there, as the Learned Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> ob&s;erves, Pag 7. and 11. of his Di&s;cour&s;e: I &s;ay whether this <HI>Dreadful Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> owes its <HI>Origine</HI> to any one, or (which is more probable) to a <HI>Concurrence,</HI> and <HI>Complication</HI> of <HI>Secondary Cau&s;es,</HI> Yet &s;till it becomes us to look higher, and to reverence <HI>Divine Providence</HI> as the fir&s;t and principal <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> The great <HI>God</HI> has &s;aid, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. <HI>[Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?] Sword</HI> and <HI>Famine</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> are what <HI>He</HI> expre&s;ly calls, <HI>His &s;ore Judgments.</HI> (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.21.) The <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Water,</HI> the <HI>Fire,</HI> the <HI>Air,</HI> all the <HI>Elements,</HI> and all their <HI>Actions</HI> are at his <HI>Beck,</HI> and under his &s;teady <HI>Government,</HI> and 'tis not improbable that he does employ <HI>Angels,</HI> as the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> to in&s;lict de&s;erved <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> and particularly this of <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> up|on a guilty People: Po&s;&s;ibly he may by their <HI>invi|&s;ible</HI> Hands &s;catter through the <HI>Air</HI> tho&s;e fatal <HI>Mi|a&s;mata,</HI> tho&s;e Malignant <HI>Venomous Atoms,</HI> and <HI>Poi&s;onous Effluvia,</HI> the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Contagious</HI> Di&s;|tempers, that carry <HI>Death and De&s;truction</HI> all a|round; to which Thought &s;ome <HI>Divines</HI> have been led by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Holy Writ</HI> that &s;eem in their opinion to look this way. Be this as it will, 'tis certain that the <HI>Almighty</HI> is the principal <HI>Agent,</HI> who orders and over-rules all <HI>Inferiour ones,</HI> and therefore whatever or whoever be the <HI>In&s;truments,</HI> 'tis with him that we have chiefly to do, 'tis from him that we have more to <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Hope</HI> than from all the <HI>World</HI> be&s;ides, and therefore it mu&s;t needs be both our Duty and our Intere&s;t to fly to his <HI>Mer|cy-Seat,</HI> to <HI>Humble</HI> our &s;elves before him, and to make our earne&s;t <HI>Supplication</HI> to him, either to <HI>Pre|&s;erve</HI> us from &s;uch <HI>Publick</HI> de&s;olating Calamities,
<PB N="25" REF="28">or to <HI>prepare</HI> us for them. And a general <HI>Humili|ation, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> is one of the mo&s;t hopeful Means of <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> from this ter|rible <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> whereby the <HI>Wrath</HI> of an <HI>offen|ded God</HI> is revealed from <HI>Heaven</HI> again&s;t the <HI>&V;n|righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&V;ngodline&s;s</HI> of a guilty World. Yea, if <HI>God</HI> &s;hould &s;ee fit to &s;end it among us, &s;uch <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Amendment,</HI> joined with a true <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Mediator,</HI> would be&s;t prepare us for it, give us the greate&s;t Courage and Comfort under it, and the mo&s;t happy I&s;&s;ue out of it, and even <HI>Death</HI> it &s;elf would be to us no other than a Pa&s;&s;age to a bet|ter <HI>Life.</HI></P>

<P>Add to the Pre&s;ervatives, that <HI>Garden Rue</HI> eaten with Bread and Butter, or made up into a <HI>Con&s;erve</HI> is much commended again&s;t the <HI>Plague,</HI> and if this were added to the <HI>Con&s;erve</HI> pre&s;cribed in <HI>Page</HI> 23.

<PB N="27" REF="30">&s;pringing up of its &s;elf in this Part of the World, I &s;hall beg Leave to add as a Clo&s;e to this <HI>Paper;</HI> That altho' it may be true that this <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> ne|ver breaks out in the&s;e <HI>Countries</HI> unle&s;s the <HI>Semina|ry</HI> of it be brought to them from &s;ome infected Place, yet the Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Air</HI> may &s;ome|times be &s;uch as to render it more apt than ordinary to receive into it the <HI>Poi&s;onous Fomes,</HI> and to pro|pagate the &s;ame, which is what the&s;e Learned <HI>Gen|tlemen</HI> do expre&s;ly acknowledge. The U&s;e which I would make of this <HI>Reflection</HI> is, that the <HI>warm Con&s;titution</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> which has prevailed for the greate&s;t Part of the pre&s;ent <HI>Winter,</HI> and is general|ly thought to be too favourable to the <HI>Seeds</HI> of this <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> (whatever they are) &s;hould put us upon <HI>Doubling our Diligence,</HI> in the U&s;e of all proper Means to guard again&s;t the Admi&s;&s;ion of any Thing from Abroad, that may give the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of its harbouring &s;uch a <HI>Fatal Mi&s;chief:</HI> for &s;hould any Thing of this Kind be conveyed to us, it may have the like unhappy Effects with a <HI>Little Spark,</HI> falling into a great Deal of <HI>Dry Tinder,</HI> that may quickly diffu&s;e it &s;elf, and break forth into a <HI>Flame</HI> not ea&s;y to be extingui&s;hed.</P>
