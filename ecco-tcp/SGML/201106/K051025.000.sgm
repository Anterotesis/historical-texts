<P>I will not &s;ay, had your benificent Di&s;po|&s;ition never appeared in favour of the wretched <HI>Incurable,</HI> that I &s;hould never have entertained any Thoughts on this Subject: But this I am obliged, in Ju&s;tice, to acknowledge, that whil&s;t I was committing them to Paper, your excellent De&s;ign was &s;o &s;trongly before me, that I found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to write regardle&s;s of it. Upon which Account, it is but Ju&s;t that I make you a Tender of what was thus written.</P>
<P>I cannot indeed per&s;uade my &s;elf, however mean the Performance may appear, that it will prove an unacceptable Pre&s;ent; &s;ince it attempts a farther Relief of tho&s;e deplorable Per&s;ons, for whom you have already expre&s;&s;ed &s;o tender a Regard.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. <HI>Of the proper Means to reduce the Number of</HI> Incurables.</HEAD>
<P>_ALTHO' &s;everal cogent Rea&s;ons, to demon&s;trate the Fea&s;ibility of the pre&s;ent De&s;ign, may be drawn from the Nature of Di&s;tempers, and the known Effects of Medicines; the common Occurrences of daily Prac|tice, and the great Probability there is of bringing many unknown Remedies to Light; yet were it not for what &s;o grave and approv'd an Author, as the great Lord-Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI> has recorded about incurable Di&s;ea&s;es, it would per|haps &s;eem daring and pre&s;umptuous to maintain the Po&s;&s;ibility of le&s;&s;ening
<PB N="2" REF="6">their Number, after &s;o many Ages appear to have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;pent in attempting it.</P>
<P>FOR, the Cure of Incurables does not only involve a Paradox in the Expre&s;&s;ion, but in an Age &s;o productive of new Di&s;coveries, and &s;o fertile in Improvements as the pre&s;ent, it generally pa&s;&s;es for a de&s;perate Problem; and is apt to be rank'd in the &s;ame Cla&s;s with the Quadrature of the Cir|cle, the Perpetual Motion, and the Philo&s;opher's Stone.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t celebrated and judicious Author abovementioned, is clear and expre&s;s, that Phy&s;icians
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">When they enquire into Di&s;ea&s;es, find &s;o many which they a&s;&s;ert to be <HI>Incurable,</HI> either from their fir&s;t Appearance, or after they have continu'd &s;ome Time, that the Pro&s;criptions of <HI>L.

<P>AFTER &s;uch a Declaration from &s;o great a Man, it will not, I hope, appear either a&s;&s;uming or ridiculous to attempt a Di&s;covery of the Cures
<PB N="3" REF="7">of &s;uch de&s;perate or inveterate Di&s;ea&s;es as may chance unju&s;tly to pa&s;s for Incurable. Such a De&s;ign, at lea&s;t, ought not to be thought a&s;&s;uming, if it be enter'd upon according to his Lord&s;hip's Direction, <Q>"To the end that the more able Phy&s;icians, and Per&s;ons of Eminence and Re&s;olution, may be encouraged and excited to a thorough pur&s;uit of this Matter;"</Q> which is the main View in publi&s;hing this Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>And if an Indulgence be granted to any thing that may &s;eem to carry an Air of Pre&s;umption or A&s;&s;urance in &s;uch an Undertaking, I am per&s;uaded there are few will think an attempt of this Nature, Ridiculous or Impracticable, after &s;o very grave and di&s;cerning an Author has laid it down for ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>Some there are, however, who will be apt to &s;ay, granting many Di&s;|ea&s;es were an hundred Years agoe, unwarrantably call'd Incurable; and al|lowing the Phy&s;icians of that time to have, in this Re&s;pect, been no le&s;s unju&s;t than rigid and &s;evere; yet after &s;o many great Improvements, and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries made in Medicine of late, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the Cen|&s;ures of the pre&s;ent Phy&s;icians &s;hould be equally unju&s;t, or equally &s;evere with tho&s;e at the time when this great Author wrote. Others will go &s;till farther and cry, can it be imagin'd, when by a grand Increa&s;e of Learning, a through Reformation in Philo&s;ophy, a prodigious Number of u&s;eful Experiments, and happy Di&s;coveries in Mechanicks, Anatomy, Chy|rurgery, Chymi&s;try, Pharmacy, and Botany, a noble Addition to the <HI>Ma|teria Medica,</HI> and the Introduction of a Mechanical Sy&s;tem of Phy&s;ic; can it be imagined will &s;ome &s;ay, when by the&s;e large Acqui&s;itions the Art of Healing &s;eems rais'd to its Achme, its Pinnacle of Perfection, that the Cen&s;ures of Phy&s;icians are not extreamly ju&s;t and utterly Irrever&s;ible; and the Number of Incurables already &s;hrunk and contracted within the narrowe&s;t Bounds human Means can reduce them?</P>
<P>Indeed, it may very well appear Surprizing, if with the&s;e accumulated Advantages the Art of Healing be not va&s;tly improv'd, and the Number of reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es le&s;&s;en'd; and yet alas! the thing it &s;elf will &s;peak and tell us, that Incurables were never more common, and that they are &s;o far from dimini&s;hing, that they rather &s;eem to grow upon us daily,
<PB N="4" REF="8">in&s;omuch, that 'tis become nece&s;&s;ary to provide for the meaner Sort of them by a new and an extraordinary Kind of Bounty.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as 'twere folly to endeavour to palliate the Matter, the com|mon Practice of every Place will, at this Day, afford a &s;ufficient Proof both of the great Number of Incurables, and the ra&s;h Cen&s;ures of Phy&s;icians. For not to mention that we daily &s;ee Per&s;ons who were given over by &s;ome Phy&s;icians, recover'd by others, what Numbers after having been de|clared Incurable by very eminent Men, and &s;uch as were well ver&s;ed in phy&s;ical Practice, have not found a Cure by Accident, the Kindne&s;s of Nature, the Ob&s;ervation of a Regimen, the U&s;e of &s;light Medicines, a Cour&s;e of Phy&s;ic, or by venturing upon &s;ome de&s;perate Means? In&s;tances of all the&s;e are every where &s;o Numerous, that 'tis in vain to go about to conceal the Thing, or its pernicious Con&s;equences: Mo&s;t Per&s;ons are now appriz'd, that <HI>Incurable</HI> in Phy&s;ic has had a like Effect with <HI>Occult Qua|lity</HI> in Philo&s;ophy, a Term which manag'd with Addre&s;s, amus'd the Mul|titude, and kept up a Veneration for an Appearance of Learning, but at the &s;ame time prov'd a very great Ob&s;tacle to farther improvement in u&s;e|ful Knowledge.</P>
<P>'Tis well known al&s;o, that every Age has had its particular Kind of Practice, which was always adequate to the Di&s;coveries of the Time, and regulated by the prevailing Philo&s;ophy of the Place; &s;o that this Practice in the Infancy of the Art, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been proportion'd to an in|fant Knowledge of Di&s;ea&s;es and Remedies. 'Tis le&s;s to be wonder'd at there|fore if the puny Phy&s;icians of the earlie&s;t Ages &s;hifted the ob&s;tinate Ca&s;es from one to another, and were pleas'd to denounce all the Di&s;ea&s;es incurable which baffled their &s;lender Skill. This Procedure, however we laugh at in them, but are our &s;elves perhaps no le&s;s Ridiculous; for we al&s;o turn off our de&s;|perate Patients, when our Remedies fail us, and term that an incurable Di&s;ea&s;e which ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;ts the fa&s;hionable Practice of our Age and Country.</P>
<P>But is a Di&s;temper therefore really Incurable, becau&s;e I, a &s;econd, or a third Per&s;on cannot cure it? Or can this Term with any Propriety, be ap|plied
<PB N="5" REF="9">to a Ca&s;e which has only eluded the prevailing or current Practice of our Time, without giving any evident Tokens, that 'tis ab&s;olutely, and in every re&s;pect Incurable? If this be &s;ufficient to denominate a Di&s;ea&s;e incu|rable, then numberle&s;s Di&s;ea&s;es, which have been cured, were incurable.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s this Term ought to be u&s;ed with great caution, becau&s;e when mi&s;applied, it not only abu&s;es the Patient, but di&s;graces the Profe&s;&s;ion, and brings a Scandal on its Profe&s;&s;ors, at the &s;ame time that it prevents an Improvement of the Art of Healing. But we of this Age ought more than tho&s;e of any precedent one, to demur in the U&s;e of the Word, when the Ca&s;e is not very plain and evident; we who are well acquainted with the Structure of the human Body, and &s;everal grand Remedies which were unknown to former Ages; we who are Ma&s;ters of all the Experience of the Ancients, and have &s;een their Weakne&s;s and Errors, as well as our own, in calling &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es incurable; we who cannot but own Po&s;te|rity may improve in their Knowledge of the&s;e Things, and be able to cure Di&s;ea&s;es reputed by us Incurable, as we have happily cured &s;ome that were &s;o reputed by Antiquity. Are not we al&s;o &s;en&s;ible that Phy&s;icians generally go in the &s;ame beaten Track, and that tho' they differ in Forms, yet u&s;ually agree to exhibit the &s;ame Medicines in like Ca&s;es? Thus all now pre&s;cribe Mercury in the Venereal Lues, and Cortex in Intermittents; and if the&s;e happen to fail, the modi&s;h Practice of our days is &s;uppos'd to be exhau&s;ted, and without farther trouble, the Ca&s;e is adjudg'd Incurable. But as this Sentence is frequently revers'd either by Nature, Accident, or Art, it is, by no means, of it &s;elf &s;ufficient to denominate a Per&s;on proper|ly Incurable, that his Ca&s;e has been un&s;ucce&s;sfully pre&s;crib'd to by a few Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>How it comes to pa&s;s that Incurables are &s;o numerous at this time, and that whil&s;t other Arts and Sciences appear in a flouri&s;hing Condition, and even Medicine it &s;elf is greatly improv'd in its Theory, yet the Art of Healing, the practical Part, the mo&s;t valuable Branch of Phy&s;ic, and ulti|mate End which all the other Branches are de&s;tin'd to promote and centre in, &s;hou'd not be equally advanced, is a Speculation that wou'd carry us beyond the Bounds of the pre&s;ent De&s;ign. And as it is of far greater Con|&s;equence
<PB N="6" REF="10">to know how to remedy this Defect in the Art of Healing, and thereby dimini&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, the Number of Incurables, than to account for the &s;low Progre&s;s of the phy&s;ical Practice; I &s;hall here confine my &s;elf to the former Con&s;ideration, and endeavour to &s;hew what is the mo&s;t proper Method of proceeding in order to di&s;cover the Cures of &s;uch Di&s;tempers as ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;ent Form of Practice, at the &s;ame Time that they give no other Signs of their being ab&s;olutely and properly Incurable.</P>
<P>The Method that I wou'd offer at in this ca&s;e, is founded on a proper U&s;e of our natural Faculties. If we will but open our Eyes, allow a free|dom of Rea&s;oning, and not be &s;low in reducing its Dictates to Action, there are good grounds to hope that the Number of reputed Incurables will &s;oon be le&s;&s;en'd, or at lea&s;t their increa&s;e be prevented; and a more accurate di&s;tinction of Di&s;ea&s;es for the future be introduced.</P>
<P>As by a reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;e, I always mean &s;uch an one as proves too &s;trong for ordinary Treatment, without affording any farther rea&s;on to per&s;uade us, that the Cure of the &s;ame Ca&s;e is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to be effected hereafter, to attempt the Cure of a reputed incurable Di&s;|ea&s;e, is in no wi&s;e Wild or Romantick. But the Way to di&s;cover &s;uch a Cure, is not to &s;top &s;hort where the common Medicines fail, lazily term the Ca&s;e Incurable, and then &s;it down contented, and applaud our &s;elves for having got to the extent of our Tether: On the contrary, if we wou'd in carne&s;t endeavour to benefit Mankind, by improving the Art of Healing, from an accurate Ob&s;ervation of the Phaenomena of Di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hould proceed to deduce their immediate Cau&s;es, and find out what kind of Re|medies are wanting to remove them; and then by the proper Experiments ob|tain the&s;e <HI>De&s;iderata,</HI> or at lea&s;t in defect of them, contrive to rai&s;e the known Remedies to their utmo&s;t Power, in order to &s;ee whether they will not then reach the more &s;tubborn Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It is &s;uch a Kind of Geometrical Method, which appears to me the mo&s;t proper to be ob&s;erv'd in this Pur&s;uit; that way of Rea&s;oning from <HI>Data</HI> to <HI>Quae&s;ita,</HI> which has done Wonders in Philo&s;ophy, A&s;tronomy, and Mechanicks. But it happens mo&s;t unfortunately, that in&s;tead of encoura|ging and pur&s;uing this noble Method in Phy&s;ic, we &s;eem almo&s;t entirely to
<PB N="7" REF="11">di&s;countenance and contemn it; in&s;tead of endeavouring by this means to cul|tivate the mo&s;t momentous Art on Earth, we are too often amu&s;ing our &s;elves with what is Trifling, when &s;et in Competition with it; and in&s;tead of endeavouring to le&s;&s;en the Number of Incurables, or ea&s;e their Tortures, we are either wrapt up in the Clouds, and contemplating the Stars, or groveling on the Ground in que&s;t of Pebbles. Not that I would Reflect on any part of Knowledge, though ever &s;o little u&s;eful; but &s;urely tho&s;e who have attach'd them&s;elves to Phy&s;ick, and make Profe&s;&s;ion of its Practice, are inexcu&s;able, if this has no &s;hare in their Studies. Some excur&s;ions out of this Province are perhaps allowable, but we &s;hould not methinks al|ways content our&s;elves with &s;earching after Things which are utterly foreign to Phy&s;ic. The Theory of Phy&s;ic, indeed, no one can deny to be u&s;eful, &s;o far as it brings Advantage to the Practice; but who does not &s;ee that 'tis Prepo&s;terous to &s;pend Time in computing the ab&s;olute force of the Mu&s;cles, the weight of the Air upon the Lungs, the ju&s;t Momentum of the FLuids, and a thou&s;and other Things; whil&s;t there remain &s;o ma|ny inquiries of infinitely greater Importance to be made, and which might even di&s;cover the cure of &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as we now mi&s;call Incurable?</P>
<P>Is it not &s;hocking to &s;ee what Pains and Application are be&s;tow'd in promoting other Arts and Sciences, whil&s;t Phy&s;ick alone is abandon'd, and &s;eems to be almo&s;t the only Art that is not cultivated among us? Thus in A&s;tronomy, a glorious Science indeed, and tho' not unworthy of the E&s;teem it meets with, is yet infinitely le&s;s conducive to the Well-being of Mankind than the Practice of Phy&s;ick; what immen&s;e Labour and A&s;&s;iduity are em|ploy'd? With what diligent attendance and watching is a new Star added to the Catalogue, or another Satellite to the train of a Planet? What Drud|gery is not gladly undergone, to determine the Magnitudes, Di&s;tances, Periods of Revolution, Gravities and Den&s;ities of the remote planetary and cometary World? But if any profe&s;s'd Phy&s;icians, leaving their own Art to the improvement of others, &s;hall give them&s;elves up to the cultivati|on of <HI>this,</HI> they may plea&s;e to con&s;ider that &s;uch procedure will afford little Con&s;olation to a Man under the raging torture of the Gout or Stone, or to tho&s;e doom'd to langui&s;h under the hard Sentence of Incurable.
<PB N="8" REF="12">What will it avail &s;uch as the&s;e, to be told the exact Minute of an E|clip&s;e, or other Re&s;ults of numerous Ob&s;ervations, and laborious Calcula|tions? And yet the&s;e Things which concern us &s;o little are highly priz'd, at the Expence of Medicine; and the Knowledge of them obtain'd with the mo&s;t vigorous Re&s;olution and a&s;&s;iduous Application. How we can an&s;wer the not taking equal Pains to di&s;cover new Remedies, improve the old ones, and advance the Art of Healing, when the Lives of Man|kind are immediately concern'd in it, I am at a lo&s;s to know. But to re|turn.</P>
<P>The Method I would recommend to find the Cures of reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es, will be be&s;t under&s;tood by the Specimen annext; where I aim to pro|ceed intirely upon rational Grounds. I mu&s;t therefore take leave to ob&s;erve, that the free u&s;e of our Rea&s;on is the be&s;t Guide we can make choice of to lead us to this Di&s;covery. By the u&s;e of Rea&s;on I wou'd be under&s;tood to mean the exerci&s;e of that Faculty upon Subjects relating to Di&s;ea&s;es, in order to find a de|&s;irable and promi&s;ing Method of Cure for an inveterate Ca&s;e, when the current Practice has proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; that is, &s;uch a Method as &s;hall, be|fore it be try'd, appear likely to &s;ucceed, when con&s;ider'd by a rational Phy&s;ician, and is more eligible to the Patient, than the Di&s;temper 'tis intended to rid him of, or at lea&s;t to palliate. Such a Method of Cure as this, is, in my Opinion, unexceptionable, in reputed incurable Ca&s;es; and ought without &s;cruple to be put in Practice by a reputed incurable Pati|ent; becau&s;e &s;uch a Patient can have no hopes of a Recovery, but either from meer Chance or Empirici&s;m, or el&s;e from the tryal of &s;uch a ratio|nal Means as is here propos'd: But any rational Per&s;on will &s;urely rather rely on Rea&s;on, than Chance for a Cure. Moreover, true rea&s;oning from the requi&s;ite <HI>Data,</HI> brings us to ab&s;olute certainty; and is always prefera|ble to Belief, Tradition, ca&s;ual Experience, or any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance rely'd on in phy&s;ical Practice: a general and rational Phy&s;ician therefore, who is never unprovided of <HI>Data</HI> to Rea&s;on from, cannot do better than thus to apply this Faculty.

<P>This method of Procedure will be readily acquie&s;c'd in by tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the general fate of Phy&s;ick. Such Per&s;ons are ant to imagine, that this is the common foot upon which all rational Phy&s;ici|ans proceed in their daily Practice, and that no other tolerable Method can be e&s;tabli&s;h'd. But the&s;e Per&s;ons are not aware how extreamly cautious and &s;paring Phy&s;icians have formerly been in the u&s;e of their Rea&s;on. That Body of Men have all along had &s;o tender a Regard to their fellow-Creatures, that they thought their utmo&s;t care was nece&s;&s;ary in the Application of Reme|dies; and therefore rarely ventured to tru&s;t &s;o dangerous a Thing as Rea|&s;on in the u&s;e of 'em. And &s;o Experience, &s;afe Experience, came to be wi&s;ely &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead: this was the Oracle, this alone was ex|toll'd, and Rea&s;on, fallacious Rea&s;on was decry'd and contemn'd, as ha|ving little to do in the Practice of Phy&s;ick. Hence they proceeded to &s;ettle Rules, and e&s;tabli&s;h Forms from Experience, chu&s;ing always to u&s;e the Remedies which had been u&s;ed before, and to pre&s;cribe over again what they had already <HI>experienc'd.</HI> To &s;werve from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Method, or prevailing Practice of the Age, was commonly thought bold and dangerous; and to try a new Re|medy, tho' it might promi&s;e ever &s;o fair, was look'd upon as hazardous and pre&s;umptuous. The practice of Phy&s;ick being thus curb'd in, and re|&s;train'd, has advanced by very &s;low Paces; and all this for want of a &s;ound Philo&s;ophy, and a larger &s;tock of <HI>Data.</HI> For certainly there can be no o|ther Pretence, why this be&s;t of Faculties &s;hould be thrown a&s;ide as u&s;e|le&s;s, or di&s;advantagious in Phy&s;ick, rather than in Philo&s;ophy, or any of the Arts and Sciences. But now as the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, as our <HI>Data</HI> are more numerous, and the way of rea&s;oning from them is improv'd; as our pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy is &s;olid and exten&s;ive, and the Subject of Phy&s;ick, the animal Structure, is va&s;tly better defin'd and under&s;tood; 'twould be highly ab&s;urd to pretend, that this grand Talent ought not to be ap|plied to di&s;cover the cures of, at lea&s;t, the reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es a|mong us. For in the&s;e Ca&s;es, our pre&s;ent &s;tock of Experience is confe&s;|&s;edly of no Service, and new random Trials might be ju&s;tly deem'd ra&s;h and Pre&s;umptuous: An attempt therefore to form a method of Cure, by argu|ing from the nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e, to the di&s;covery of more powerful
<PB N="10" REF="14">Remedies, is here the only rational and promi&s;ing means we have left.</P>
<P>It will &s;urely be granted, that the pre&s;ent practice of Phy&s;ick is im|proveable, if it be con&s;ider'd, that the &s;everal Branches of which this Art is compos'd, are daily improving; whil&s;t new di&s;coveries are made in A|natomy, and Chirurgery grows more compleat; whil&s;t Chymi&s;try and Phar|macy furni&s;h us with new Preparations, and Mechanicks is more &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully applied to the animal Structure; it cannot be doubted but &s;ome u&s;e may be made of the&s;e Things to the advantage of Phy&s;ick, and the cure of reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es. There is no room to que&s;tion, that many powerful Remedies lye now ab&s;conded, or enveloped in their fir&s;t Prin|ciples, if it be con&s;ider'd, that the whole Set we are at this time ac|quainted with, were once in the &s;ame &s;tate of Darkne&s;s and Confu&s;ion. Let us but reflect, that <HI>Agues</HI> were reputed incurable till the Cortex was found, and its U&s;es known, as well as the <HI>Lues Venerea</HI> till Mercury, and the Woods were applied; and con&s;ider by <HI>what</HI> means not only the&s;e, but numberle&s;s other u&s;eful Medicines were obtain'd; and then there will be very great Encouragement to expect, that if diligent &s;earch were made, and the proper Experiments in&s;tituted, many grand Remedies might be di&s;clo&s;ed, and &s;uch as wou'd be of force &s;ufficient to cure &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es which now lye under the unju&s;t Sentence of Incurable.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only rea&s;on we have to hope for &s;uch a Redre&s;s in the Art of Healing, and a con&s;iderable Reduction of the pre&s;ent Incurables: great A&s;&s;i&s;tance may in this ca&s;e be likewi&s;e obtain'd from a due management of the Remedies we are already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of. For there are &s;o many Requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary to advance the&s;e to their highe&s;t Power, that it may very well be que&s;tioned, if the utmo&s;t force they are capable of affording, was ever exerted on the cau&s;e of any Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Chymi&s;try has improv'd the Efficacy of many Medicaments, and &s;hewn them to have &s;uch Virtues, as were utterly unknown before that Art be|came general: And Fire is an Element from which other as great Matters may be ju&s;tly expected. Be&s;ides this, an inverted Order, a well propor|tion'd Do&s;e, a proper preparation of the Body and Medicine, a right Choice,
<PB N="11" REF="15">a &s;elect Combination, with many other Things of the like kind, have an immen&s;e Power to increa&s;e the Virtues of Remedies. Here then is an al|mo&s;t inexhau&s;tible fountain of u&s;eful Varieties put into our Hands, which we can manage as we plea&s;e; and if they were properly employ'd, 'tis not to be &s;aid what Effects they might produce in ob&s;tinate or reputed incurable Ca&s;es. That this may the better be apprehended, let it be con&s;ider'd by way of Illu&s;tration, that when the <HI>Cortex</HI> has prov'd ineffectual for the cure of an Ague, being given before the Body was rightly di&s;pos'd, it will &s;ucceed when exhibited after due Preparation; that Opiates mixed with Purgatives will take effect, which admini&s;tred &s;ingle might fail; that Solids will purge when Fluids will not; that lenient Purgatives will open the Body where &s;trong Catharticks wou'd loo&s;e their force; that &s;ome Medicines &s;ucceed when given in &s;mall quantities, at long Intervals, which admini&s;tred otherwi&s;e would have a contrary effect; and in &s;hort, that all po&s;&s;ible Combinations, Do&s;es, Preparations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have never yet been try'd, nor perhaps ever can be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>From all which it appears, that the cures of &s;ome reputed incurable Di&s;|ea&s;es may be ju&s;tly expected, either from a di&s;covery of new powerful Reme|dies, or a more appo&s;ite u&s;e of the old ones. Our Method therefore ought to have regard to both the&s;e De&s;iderata.</P>
<P>In order to acquire new Remedies, let us &s;uppo&s;e the true and immediate Cau&s;e of a &s;tubborn di&s;order to be found, which in all bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, is com|monly material; our Method of proceeding directs us to obtain this material Cau&s;e, where-ever it can be come at, and to make the proper Experiments up|on that very Matter out of the Body, which being included in it was the Parent of the Di&s;order. An Example or two will make all plain. The <HI>cretacecus Matter,</HI> or <HI>chalky Stones,</HI> which are often thrown out in a Fit of the Gout, ap|pear to have been the immediate cau&s;e of that Fit. A proper quantity of the&s;e therefore being obtain'd, and the Nature of them di&s;cover'd from the Symptoms of the Di&s;temper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we are hence directed to try any Prepa|ration that we know has a power to act upon, and di&s;&s;olve Matter of the like kind. But in ca&s;e &s;uch a Di&s;&s;olvent be unknown to us, then are we to contrive &s;ome Compo&s;itions, after the &s;ame manner as if we were pre|&s;cribing
<PB N="12" REF="16">to an inveterate ca&s;e of a Patient afflicted with the Di&s;temper, and try their Virtues upon the&s;e Stones, till at length we arrive at a Prepa|ration that proves a real Di&s;&s;olvent, at the &s;ame time that it may be &s;afely admini&s;tred, &s;ome convenient way, in &s;uch a quantity as to be able to ef|fect the like di&s;&s;olution of that cretaceous Matter, whil&s;t it is circulating in the Fluids of the Body. Such a Compo&s;ition, 'tis rea&s;onable to expect, wou'd prove a grand Remedy, and perhaps a Specifick, that is, &s;uch a Me|dicine as will effect a Cure without cau&s;ing any &s;en&s;ible Evacuation. Un|der&s;tand the like Experiments to be made upon the Stones, which are apt to lodge in the Bladder or Kidneys, till a proper Di&s;&s;olvent be found, which, if it cannot &s;afely effect the de&s;ired di&s;&s;olution in the Body, may at lea&s;t be &s;o managed, as to prevent the future Generation of a Stone. Again, &s;uppo&s;ing the ca&s;e of an Hydrophobia occa&s;ion'd by the Bite of a mad Dog, where we know the Fluids are contaminated by an actual Poy&s;on, which being contagious by a Communication of any of tho&s;e Fluids, a way may very ea&s;ily be contriv'd to obtain a quantity of the infected Saliva, or any other of the animal Juices, in order to make the proper Experiments upon it, till an Antidote for the Venom were by that means di&s;cover'd. This Antidote might thus be known to be found. Suppo&s;ing two equal Portions of the con|taminated Fluid to be procured, and the pre&s;umed Antidote to be mix'd in one of them, let both be communicated by Injection, or otherwi&s;e to two &s;ound Dogs; and if that wherein the pre&s;um'd Antidote was contain'd, proves harmle&s;s, and the other noxious, and the &s;ame Con&s;equence at|tends the &s;ame Experiment in two or three Repetitions; it would be rea|&s;onably to expect that the Cure of this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e was di&s;cover'd, and the Medicine might therefore be try'd occa&s;ionally upon Hydrophobous Patients, or rather admini&s;tred &s;oon after the Bite was receiv'd.</P>
<P>How far this Method of proceeding may be put in Practice, I will not pre&s;ume to determine; but 'tis very probable that it may be advantageou&s;ly pur&s;u'd at lea&s;t in all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers which yield a gro&s;&s;er kind of Mat|ter for their Cau&s;e, or el&s;e depend upon, a vi&s;ible alteration in the Con|&s;i&s;tence, Texture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Fluids. This is certainly a mo&s;t de&s;irable and rational way of procuring Specificks or grand Remedies, &s;ince the
<PB N="13" REF="17">Lives of Mankind are not hereby in the lea&s;t endanger'd; and it otherwi&s;e remains, that we wait for their Di&s;covery till mere chance &s;hall place them before us, open our Eyes, and force us by repeated Importunities and Solli|citations, at once to acknowledge their Virtues, and our own Indolence. If the whole tribe of reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es, gave &s;uch fair Opportunities as the&s;e for the di&s;covery of their re&s;pective Specificks (and that mo&s;t of them do not, I would have no one be too po&s;itive) we might &s;oon &s;ee their number &s;hrink, upon allowing a proper Patronage and Encouragement to this kind of Experiments.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice, how apt we are to plume our &s;elves upon living in an Age when experimental Philo&s;ophy flouri&s;hes. Experi|ments, its true, are daily made, but I wou'd fain know to what grand Purpo&s;es they &s;erve? Several indeed there are, who&s;e de&s;ign is highly Com|mendable; but are there any now on foot, or that can po&s;&s;ibly be con|triv'd, of greater Moment, than the &s;ort above mentioned; any more Bene|ficial to Mankind, or Ornamental to a Nation; any &s;o well de&s;erving the Encouragement of the Wealthy, and the Countenance of the Learned? But in&s;tead of &s;uch u&s;eful E&s;&s;ays as the&s;e, we generally meet with At|tempts &s;o mean and low, &s;o trivial and contemptible, in compari&s;on of them, that one wou'd be tempted to think they came from the igno|rant Vulgar, and the Herd of Mankind, rather than from the polite and philo&s;ophical Part of the Species. 'Tis a melancholy Reflection, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons from who&s;e open Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;urprizing Di&s;coveries might be ju&s;tly expected, &s;hould generally amu&s;e us with the <HI>Minutiae</HI> of Things, put us off with the Tith of Mint and Cummin, and leave us to &s;eek the weigh|tier Matters, the advancement of Phy&s;ic, and the Reduction of Incurables from another Quarter.</P>
<P>But what an Improvement of the Art of Healing may we not expect, what Alleviation of the Mi&s;eries of the Incurable may we not hope for, when a &s;pa|cious Building is now purpo&s;ely crecting for their Reception and U&s;e? This &s;eems not only a particular In&s;tance of compa&s;&s;ionate Bounty, but a De&s;ire ex|pre&s;s'd for the improvement of Phy&s;ic, and the univer&s;al Benefit of Mankind in an illu&s;trious Pre&s;ident of a &s;olid and diffu&s;ive Good. Phy&s;icians then, we
<PB N="14" REF="18">may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume, will not now be &s;o far wanting to them&s;elves, to their Art, and to human Nature, as to neglect this or the like favourable Opportunities, of rai&s;ing the Reputation of their Profe&s;&s;ion, by di&s;covering the Cures for the unju&s;tly &s;uppos'd Incurable, and le&s;&s;ening the Torments of the mi&s;erable Objects, to whom &s;uch Goodne&s;s is &s;hewn.</P>
<P>No longer let us, through Ea&s;e and Indolence, give occa&s;ion to Empiricks to triumph over us, and boa&s;t them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of Speci|ficks for the Di&s;ea&s;es which we incon&s;iderately pronounce Incurable: No longer let us &s;uffer the People to be deluded with the &s;pecious <HI>Arcana</HI> of ignorant Men; <HI>Arcana</HI> the dear and de&s;perate purchace of hazardous Ex|periments, and random trials on the human Kind: No longer let us leave to Chance, and the &s;low workings of Nature, the Di&s;covery and Production of tho&s;e u&s;eful Remedies which we are furni&s;h'd with Faculties to &s;earch for and obtain. Who does not rather repo&s;e his Confidence in Rea&s;on, and the due exerci&s;e of his own Abilities, than tru&s;t to Accident the manage|ment of any Affair? And &s;hall we in the Art of Healing alone, put off our inquiries till Chance &s;hall deign to pre&s;ent us with the means of Re|covery, when Health is within our own reach? We &s;eem to want no Pre|parative in this ca&s;e, but a Re&s;olution to &s;tep beyond the &s;low-paced Practice in vogue, and to be guided by our Rea&s;on in the choice of Experiments. We are every way fitted to go immediately upon &s;o u&s;eful an Undertaking: We have &s;een the Effects of a tolerable number of Trials made upon human Blood, and other animal Fluids; which when improv'd and enlar|ged, may &s;erve to very u&s;eful Purpo&s;es: We are furni&s;h'd with a large &s;tock of <HI>Data,</HI> and know how to increa&s;e it at Di&s;cretion: The Cau&s;es of Di|&s;ea&s;es are generally known, and Materials for Experiments are every where at hand; &s;o that if the Work were heartily &s;et about, there is no fear of Succe&s;s. A Set of <HI>Axioms</HI> al&s;o might be laid down to encourage and di|rect the Undertaking, and &s;erve as Rules in the Pro&s;ecution of it. Such as the following for Example.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mathematical Certainty ought not to be expected in Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Chronic Di&s;ea&s;e allows many Opportunities for the Di&s;covery and U&s;e of Remedies.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="19">
<P N="3">3. The &s;ucce&s;s or failure of a &s;ingle Experiment, is not &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h or aboli&s;h the u&s;e of a Remedy.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any unde&s;irable Method of Cure &s;hall, upon repeated trials, ei|ther prove intirely un&s;ucce&s;sful, or &s;uffer more to die than recover, it ought not to be acquie&s;c'd in, before, at lea&s;t, other more de&s;irable and pro|mi&s;ing Methods &s;hall have been tried.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis better to try any de&s;irable and promi&s;ing Method of Cure, than run the hazard of langui&s;hing out a Life in Pain and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="6">6. If any Di&s;ea&s;e can be tran&s;muted into another, attended with le&s;s Danger, and le&s;s Pain, every &s;uch Tran&s;mutation is a Degree of Cure.</P>
<P N="7">7. A Remedy that acts immediately upon the Seat of a Di&s;ea&s;e, is more likely to effect a Cure, than one that acts only Con&s;equentially upon it.</P>
<P N="8">8. No more cau&s;es of a Di&s;ea&s;e need be inquired after, than will fairly and naturally account for its <HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. In every inveterate and dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, the mo&s;t powerful Reme|dies ought to be immediately applied.</P>
<P N="10">10. No Remedy can rationally be directed before it be known what Life is, together with its Cau&s;e, State and Effects; and what a Di&s;ea&s;e is, together with its Cau&s;e, State and Effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e may &s;uffice for a Specimen of what Rules might be given to for|ward the di&s;covery of the Cures of reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>But let this bu&s;ine&s;s proceed as it may, and that the Succe&s;s will be pro|portionable to the Application, cannot be denied; we certainly have it already in our Power, by the U&s;e of known Remedies to make &s;e|veral, whether real or reputed Incurables, pa&s;s their Lives with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction than they would enjoy without, them: Nay, by well adapted Regimen and Remedies, 'tis po&s;&s;ible not only to palliate, but to change a &s;tubborn Di&s;temper, &s;o that it may ju&s;tly pa&s;s for a degree of Cure, or really become a partial one. But when a Ca&s;e is per|emptorily adjudg'd ab&s;olutely Incurable, the Patient is u&s;ually di&s;pirited, and with difficulty brought to follow tho&s;e Rules which wou'd produce this Effect.

Some Rea&s;on drawn from the Nature of the Thing, is requi&s;ite to &s;hew a Ca&s;e to be ab&s;olutely Incurable; to denomi|nate a Patient &s;o, a groundle&s;s Conjecture will &s;erve.</P>
<P>'Tis likewi&s;e evident, that reputed Incurable may chance, at the &s;ame time, to prove real incurable Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;o that to introduce a more accurate Di&s;tinction, and to &s;hew the true difference betwixt them, is of great Im|portance.</P>
<P>'Tis not nece&s;&s;ary however, in an E&s;&s;ay which rather propo&s;es what ought to be done, before we make &s;o free with a Term, upon who&s;e u&s;e the Lives and Health of Mankind depend, than undertakes to do it; 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;ay, in &s;uch an E&s;&s;ay as this, to de&s;cend &s;o far as to inquire what Life and Health are, what their Cau&s;es and Effects, wherein they con&s;i&s;t, by what various Means, and how far they may be impair'd or dimini&s;h'd before Death nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ues; all which it wou'd be ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to know in the re&s;pective Di&s;tempers, if we were willing to &s;ee whe|ther any, and which of the Catalogue of Di&s;ea&s;es are in their own Nature ab&s;olutely, and in every Stage properly Incurable; or if we would fix the Point in other Ca&s;es, to which when Di&s;ea&s;es arrive, they will never admit of farther Alleviation. The&s;e Things are here &s;uppos'd to be in great mea&s;ure known already, altho' they highly de&s;erve the mo&s;t exact and careful In|quiry.</P>
<P>But not to let this weighty Matter pa&s;s intirely unregarded, it &s;hou'd be ob&s;erved, that if a Di&s;temper be ab&s;olutely Incurable, the rea&s;on why it is &s;o, mu&s;t ari&s;e either from the Nature of the Di&s;order, or the natural Im|perfection of Medicine; and con&s;equently where the Properties and imme|diate Cau&s;e of a Di&s;ea&s;e are well known, and yet from them no Rea&s;on can be deduced to manife&s;t the ca&s;e Incurable; that it pa&s;&s;es for &s;uch, ought to be attributed to the natural Imperfection of the Art of Healing. But the Art of Healing cannot be &s;aid to be naturally Imperfect, till its utmo&s;t extent be known, that is, till the animal Oeconomy, and the immediate Cau&s;es of its Di&s;orders are throughly under&s;tood, and the utmo&s;t Powers of the known Remedies have been fully obtain'd; if not al&s;o, till all the di&s;|coverable
<PB N="20" REF="24">ones have after the be&s;t Manner been experienc'd. Now if all the&s;e Advantages have not been acquir'd in our Days, as no con&s;iderate Per&s;on will &s;ay they have, it follows, that no Di&s;temper can properly by us be called Incurable, but where &s;ome evident Cau&s;e of its being &s;o, ap|pears from the Nature of the Thing it &s;elf. For unle&s;s this Cau&s;e be ma|nife&s;t, to pretend a Di&s;ea&s;e is not to be alleviated in any of its Stages, or that a Cure can be carry'd no farther, when we don't know why, is a bold Gue&s;s; and to pronounce the Ca&s;e Incurable, even after we have done our utmo&s;t, will mean no more than that the Remedies hitherto u&s;ed in it, have fail'd of the defir'd Effect. But wou'd not &s;uch a Cen&s;ure be equally Ridiculous, as to &s;ay, ten or an hundred un&s;ucce&s;sful Experiments have been made to tran&s;mute Metals, and therefore their Tran&s;mutation is un|di&s;coverable? Here then is a Foundation for a ju&s;t Di&s;tinction between real and reputed incurable Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee in Chirurgery, tho&s;e Wounds are properly adjudg'd Mortal or Incurable, which happen in &s;uch Parts of the Body who&s;e Union was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to the continuance of Life; as for Example, a tran&s;|ver&s;e Section of the <HI>Larynx,</HI> which intirely &s;tops Re&s;piration; a di&s;union of the <HI>Cerebellum,</HI> which prevents the Influx of the Fluid there &s;ecreted into the Heart; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e and the like Ca&s;es are ju&s;tly deem'd Incurable, from the very In&s;tant when the Wounds were fir&s;t inflicted; becau&s;e here the vital Functions are evidently de&s;troyed, without any opportunity be|ing allow'd for the U&s;e of Remedies. This is the mo&s;t determin'd and genuine Sen&s;e of the Word, and therefore the U&s;e of it in other Ca&s;es ought to be judg'd of, by its Approach to, or Rece&s;s from this original Meaning. And accordingly where the Fatality of Wounds is le&s;s &s;ud|den, and le&s;s certain, as in Ob&s;tructions of the animal Faculties, &s;up|po&s;e by a tran&s;ver&s;e Section of the <HI>Oesophagus,</HI> the Term Incurable can|not with equal Certainty be apply'd at the In&s;tant the Wound was re|ceiv'd, becau&s;e there may be other Ways contriv'd of conveying Nu|triment to the Body, be&s;ides by the Mouth; and in the mean Time, Op|portunities may be afforded, of applying the proper Remedies. But if the Body could be &s;upply'd with Nutriment only by the Mouth, and
<PB N="21" REF="25">there were no Opportunities allow'd for the U&s;e of Means for Reco|very, then &s;uch a Ca&s;e might, with equal Certainty, be pronounc'd In|curable, or mortal, as one of the former Kind; though the Prediction would not be &s;o &s;oon fulfilled. In all &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e, 'tis evident when and why the Term incurable is applicable, which is always go|verned by the Nature of the Thing, and the Opportunities there are for the U&s;e of Remedies, or el&s;e by the natural Imperfection of the Art of Chirurgery: Whereas on the contrary, in &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es, both Acute and Chronic, this Term is apply'd, where no &s;uch Rea&s;ons appear. Thus when certain equivocal Symptoms come on in acute Di&s;tem|pers, without having any Regard to the immediate or material Cau&s;e of the Di&s;orders of the animal Oeconomy; they con&s;i&s;t in without &s;o much as any po&s;itive Idea in our Minds, obtain'd from reflecting on the Nature of the Di&s;temper; and without con&s;idering the State of the Art of Healing, we at pre&s;ent make no Scruple to adjudge them mortal, or Incurable, though neither the vital, natural, or animal Faculties are wanting. Thus for In&s;tance, we proceed in the Plague, malignant Fe|ver, Goal-Di&s;temper, and the confluent Species of the Small-Pox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when perhaps if the Matter were carefully examin'd into, &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es ought never to be call'd Incurable, till they arrive at the very Point of Death. But if there be any Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pend this final Judg|ment in acute Ca&s;es, is there not va&s;tly more to be cautious, how we pa&s;s &s;uch a Cen&s;ure in chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, where no Opportunities are wanting to make the nece&s;&s;ary Inquiries to find out the Cau&s;e, and to apply the proper Remedies? And what rea&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;|&s;igned, that the re&s;pective Specificks for the Gout and Stone, &s;hall ne|ver be di&s;cover'd; or that no means can be contriv'd to alleviate the Pain of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, farther than is effected by the pre&s;ent Practice? Who can pretend, that an Antidote for the Bite of a mad Dog is undi&s;coverable, when he con&s;iders we are Ma&s;ters of the Specifick for that of the Viper? But to call the&s;e, and &s;everal other Di&s;ea&s;es In|curable, is the Way to make them &s;o, as being apt to put a Stop to farther Inquiries into the Nature of them, and retard the Di&s;covery of any Thing that
<PB N="22" REF="26">has a Relation to their Cure. At lea&s;t then, let no one pretend to call any Ca&s;e Incurable, till he is well acquainted with the Subject of Di&s;ea&s;es; till he knows their true and immediate Cau&s;e, and the ut|mo&s;t Virtues of the &s;everal Remedies we are at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of.</P>
<P>An animated human Body, we are certain, is a pure mechanical Structure, wholly compos'd of Solids and Fluids; and con&s;equently the immediate Cau&s;e of every bodily Di&s;ea&s;e, can be only Matter and Mo|tion.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t Virtues of Remedies cannot be known, till the Reme|dies have been mo&s;t artificially prepar'd and combin'd, mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably and properly apply'd, exhibited in the mo&s;t ju&s;t Quantity, at the mo&s;t proper Intervals, and la&s;tly, continu'd in exact Proportion to the De|mand of the Di&s;temper. All which Requi&s;ites, there is little Rea&s;on to believe, have been hitherto &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd in their Exhibition. And be&s;ides the Improvement which may be made in the pre&s;ent Set of Remedies, 'tis not to be doubted, as was before ob&s;erv'd, that many o|thers, of equal Virtue, may be di&s;cover'd by proper Application; upon all which Accounts, it were greatly to be wi&s;h'd, that Phy&s;icians would never apply the Term Incurable to any Ca&s;es, but &s;uch alone where that Matter and Motion are wanting, which Life, even in its lowe&s;t and weake&s;t State requires, or when all means, by which they u&s;ed to be &s;upply'd, are intirely cut off. For if a Di&s;temper be curable on|ly in Part, 'tis improperly call'd incurable, till that partial Cure, can by human Means, be carry'd no farther.</P>
<P>We daily ob&s;erve &s;o many unexpected and &s;urprizing Turns in the Di&s;orders of a human Body; Nature here acts by &s;o many &s;ecret Springs, and makes &s;o many unfore&s;een Sallies and Excur&s;ions, as if &s;he took Delight to mock our Toil, baffle our be&s;t concerted Mea|&s;ures, and rever&s;e our be&s;t form'd Judgments, that it is pre&s;umptuous, where the Ca&s;e is not manife&s;t, to pretend to fix and determine the Point &s;he &s;hall ju&s;t come up to, and not exceed; to &s;ay, hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no farther; here the Di&s;ea&s;e is Incurable, and here the Art of Healing fails. No one le&s;s than an ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of this Art,
<PB N="23" REF="27">will &s;urely ever go &s;o far. If indeed we could always obtain from an exact ob&s;ervation of the Properties of Di&s;ea&s;es, their true and imme|diate Cau&s;es, and had a previous Knowledge of the utmo&s;t Effects, the be&s;t adapted Regimen and Remedies would have upon them, then we might pre&s;ume to determine what Ca&s;es either were, or were not in|curable, by the pre&s;ent known Remedies; and no one, without this Qualification, can pa&s;s a valid Judgment. Let us then endeavour to increa&s;e our Knowledge of Di&s;tempers and Remedies, by all po&s;&s;ible Means, and not venture to pronounce the Sentence of incurable upon Di&s;ea&s;es, at lea&s;t till we have acquir'd &s;uch a Definition of them, as will bring us acquainted with their real Cau&s;es; and till we are Ma|&s;ters of the be&s;t Way of managing and improving the Remedies we enjoy.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover whether a reputed incurable be al&s;o a real incurable Di&s;temper, I apprehend the be&s;t Cour&s;e to be taken, is fir&s;t to &s;et down the &s;everal Properties of every Ca&s;e di&s;tinctly; next, to draw as many Con&s;equences from the&s;e Properties, as may give Light into the Na|ture of the Ca&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;covering its immediate Cau&s;e: And when this is obtain'd, we are naturally directed to &s;earch for the Re|medy; &s;o that at length, by this Method of Proceeding, we &s;hall &s;ee how far our pre&s;ent Stock of Remedies will reach, after they have been duly improv'd; and what we are farther directed to &s;eek for, to advance the Art of Healing to a greater Perfection. To u&s;her in this Method, I will here &s;et down a few &s;hort Examples, by way of Spe|cimen, of what may be expected from it, upon a proper application. The Ca&s;es I &s;hall chu&s;e to in&s;tance in, are <HI>reputed Incurable,</HI> either from their fir&s;t appearance, to their ultimate Stage, or after a &s;et Time; the Sequel will &s;hew whether they really de&s;erve the Appellation of incurable, or ought to be re&s;cu'd, and &s;et free from the tyrannical Im|po&s;ition of a mi&s;employ'd Term.</P>

<P N="1">1. THERE are two Species of this Di&s;temper, <HI>viz.</HI> Melancholia and Mania.</P>

<P N="14">14. Anatomy &s;hews in both Species, that the Brain and its Meninges are dry, hard and cri&s;p; its Cortex yellow, and that its Ve&s;&s;els abound in Varices, and are di&s;tended with a black vi&s;cid Gore.</P>
<P N="15">15. The Mania, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of the common Practice, has been cured by &s;pontaneous Varices or Haemorrhoids, by a Drop&s;y, Dy&s;en|tery, a tertian or quartan Ague, and large Haemorrhages.</P>
<P N="16">16. Does it not follow, that the immediate Cau&s;e of both Species is an Evaporation of the more &s;ubtile Parts of the Fluids? 1. 2. 3. 7. 10. 13. 14.</P>
<P N="17">17. That the Mania differs from the Hypochondria only in degree, 4. 5. 6. 14. 15. Since they both have the &s;ame Cau&s;es, and exhibit the &s;ame Appearance upon Di&s;&s;ection?</P>
<P N="18">18. That this Di&s;ea&s;e unju&s;tly pa&s;&s;es for incurable 6. 15. even altho' a Year or two may have been un&s;ucce&s;sfully &s;pent in attempting its Cure?</P>
<P N="19">19. And la&s;tly, that the Specific wanting in both Species, is &s;uch a Reme|dy, as will prevent this Evaporation 16. which remains to be di&s;cover'd by proper Experiments.</P>
<P N="20">20. In the mean time, perhaps no known Remedy will more forcibly contract the Pores, and prevent this Evaporation, than the Cold Bath, when u&s;ed &s;o as to exert its proper force.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="30">
<P N="21">21. Now the Cold Bath can only act upon the Body by its Gravity or Pre&s;&s;ure, the In&s;inuation of the Parts whereof it is compos'd, and its Cold|ne&s;s; but its Gravity or Pre&s;&s;ure will be proportionably increa&s;ed by a deep|er Immer&s;ion, and this will con&s;equently render the In&s;inuation of the Water proportionably greater.

<HEAD>Of the Rabies Canina, or Hydrophobia, con&s;e|quent upon the Bite of a mad-Dog.</HEAD>
<P>THE Properties of this Di&s;ea&s;e are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis &s;pontaneous in many Animals, e&s;pecially in Dogs, Foxes, and Wolves, which communicate it not only to one another, but to Men, by Contagion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;lighte&s;t Bite of an Animal thus infected is often fatal, as it is al&s;o to touch their Saliva with the Tongue, or to handle &s;uch In&s;tru|ments much, as have been u&s;ed about them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Contagion in a human Body, manife&s;ts it&s;elf at various Inter|vals in various Subjects; in &s;ome it will lurk for &s;everal Years.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Place where the Bite happen'd fir&s;t becomes painful, the Pain &s;preads to the adjacent Parts, a Wearine&s;s and Heavine&s;s is felt in the Fle&s;h, the Sleep is broken, di&s;compos'd, frightful, and attended with Convul&s;ions. The Patient is unea&s;y when awake, he &s;ighs, is &s;ad, and &s;eeks Solitude. The&s;e Symptoms gradually increa&s;e, and a Dif|ficulty of Re&s;piration comes on, which is now frequently interrupted with Sighs; an unu&s;ual Dread and Terror upon beholding any Liquid, lo&s;s of Appetite; to ta&s;te any Liquor cau&s;es very great Anxiety, Tre|mors and Convul&s;ions; vomiting of a vi&s;cid bilious or green Matter, Heat, Fever, Watching, Priapi&s;mus, &s;trange di&s;orderly Ideas. The Tongue is dry, and extended out of the Mouth, there is a Hoar&s;ene&s;s and very great Drought; the Patient at length now becomes outragious upon attemp|ting
<PB N="28" REF="32">to drink; he endeavours to bite whoever he meets with; he foams at the Mouth, and gna&s;hes with his Teeth; a cold Sweat comes on; he grows mo&s;t outragiou&s;ly mad, and, with the utmo&s;t Difficulty of Re&s;pi|ration, dies convul&s;ive.</P>
<P N="5">5. From Di&s;&s;ection it appears, That the Organs of Deglutition are inflam'd, that a vi&s;cid bilious matter is lodg'd in the Stomach, that the Gall-Bladeer is full of black Bile, that the Pericardium is dry, that the Lungs are greatly overcharg'd with Blood, that the Arteries are full of a ve|ry liquid Blood, but the Veins empty. Tis remarkable, that this Blood will &s;carce coagulate, when extrava&s;ated and expo&s;ed to the Air. All the Mu&s;cles, Vi&s;cera, Brain, and Spinal Marrow appear too dry.</P>
<P N="6">6. Is not therefore the immediate Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e a &s;ubtile Poi&s;on in the Fluids, who&s;e Specific Antidote is unknown to us?</P>
<P N="7">7. And till this Antidote can be found, is it not clear, that all man|ner of Evacuations, e&s;pecially Phlebotomy or rather Arteriotomy, are to be u|&s;ed in every Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e; and all other Mea&s;ures to be pur&s;u'd, which tend to introduce new Fluids, in the Room of the contaminated Set; or at lea&s;t to di&s;charge &s;o much of the Virus, as to le&s;&s;en its pernicious Con&s;equences?</P>
<P N="8">8. The Effects of this Virus in the Body, being &s;o very dreadful and fatal, may ju&s;tify the U&s;e even of &s;evere and hazardous Means to pre|vent 'em, &s;o that at lea&s;t Phlebotomy <HI>ad Animi Deliquium u&s;&abque;</HI> may be occa|&s;ionally repeated; not only upon that Account, but al&s;o by rea&s;on of the very great Inflammation that attends it. And becau&s;e Fear is known to have been &s;erviceable in this Ca&s;e; may it not be very proper to con|trive &s;ome extraordinary Ways to rai&s;e this Pa&s;&s;ion to a very great De|gree, if not before Immer&s;ion in the cold Bath, at lea&s;t by means there|of, being us'd in almo&s;t its utmo&s;t force?</P>

<HEAD>Of the Pal&s;y.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE are three Species of this Di&s;ea&s;e. 1. Where Motion a|lone is wanting. 2. Where Sen&s;ation alone is wanting. 3. Where both Motion and Sen&s;ation are wanting.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis often preceded by the Apoplexy, Epilep&s;y, or Convul&s;ions, a Retention of the natural Evacuations, a Tran&s;lation of the Matter of an acute or chronic Di&s;ea&s;e; Wounds, Contu&s;ions, Luxations, Compre&s;|&s;ions, Ero&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> inten&s;e Cold or Heat, too free an U&s;e of hot Water, Exhalations of poi&s;onous Minerals admitted into the Body.</P>
<P N="3">3. The paralytic Parts grow cold, &s;oft, flaccid and wa&s;te gradually.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis often critically cur'd, or by the Force of Nature, either by a &s;pontaneous and la&s;ting Diarrhaea, a Fever, an in&s;en&s;ible Di&s;&s;ipati|on of the morbific Cau&s;e, or la&s;tly, by a convul&s;ive Motion of the Part.</P>
<P N="5">5. From hence it follows, that the immediate Cau&s;e of the Pal&s;y is a Want of the Influx of the Blood, or nervous Fluid, or both, into the Part, 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Parts lo&s;e their natural Ela&s;ticity. 2, 3.</P>
<P N="7">7. That when both the nervous and arterial Fluid is wanting to the Part, and the Canals are depriv'd of their natural Ela&s;ticity, the Ca&s;e is mo&s;t inveterate.</P>
<P N="8">8. That its Cau&s;e may be either external or internal. 2.</P>
<P N="9">9. That the Want of the nervous and arterial Fluid, is either owing to a Fault in their re&s;pective Canals, or to the Fluids them&s;elves. 2.</P>
<PB N="30" REF="34">
<P N="10">10. That it may be cured either by a Specific or an Evacuant, 4. and con&s;equently is not ju&s;tly reputed incurable.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the Cure depends upon removing the Ob&s;truction to the Influx of the Fluids, and deriving them in their natural State, into their re&s;pective Canals.</P>
<P N="12">12. That the Cure mu&s;t be adapted to the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="13">13. Suppo&s;ing then, both Canals and Fluids to be affected; the Canals to have become cold and flaccid, and the Fluids gro&s;s and te|nacious; 'tis plain, that a powerful Di&s;&s;olvent, which at the &s;ame time that it liquifies and purifies the Blood, promotes a free Circulation in the di&s;order'd Parts, and re&s;tores the Ela&s;ticity to the Canals, will prove a Specific in this Ca&s;e: And why the Cortex Peruvianus, when rais'd to its utmo&s;t or proportionable Power, may not prove this Specific, per|haps nothing but the proper Experiments will &s;hew.</P>
<P N="14">14. The very great Effects of a due U&s;e of the Cortex, not only in intermitting Fevers, but in many other Di&s;orders, both of the Solids and Fluids, are too well known to &s;tand in need of a particular Enu|meration; and this Medicament is now &s;o univer&s;ally allow'd to be &s;afe as well as efficacious, when properly apply'd, that I know of no Ob|jection that can lie again&s;t the U&s;e of it in the Pal&s;y. Tho&s;e who think it not of Force &s;ufficient in &s;uch an ob&s;tinate Di&s;temper as this, when, after &s;ome Months have to no Purpo&s;e been &s;pent upon it, 'tis reputed Incurable, will plea&s;e to con&s;ider its &s;urprizing Effects on the Solids and Fluids in a rebellious Quartan Ague, in what very large Do&s;es 'tis capable of being exhibited, and how much a prudent Mixture of <HI>Sal Ab&s;inth: &amp;c.</HI> will add to its Virtue; e&s;pecially if &s;o grand a Remedy as the cold Bath, when duly improv'd, may be call'd in to its A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as in the Di&s;temper we are &s;peaking of, it frequently may.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lues Venerea.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN this Di&s;ea&s;e is hereditary, or become univer&s;al, it ap|pears under various Forms, but may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the&s;e Properties.</P>
<P>It generally begins with an Itching, Heat, and Inflammation in &s;ome Part of the Body. Whiti&s;h Pu&s;tules appear, which drying, &s;cale off, and leave a Cavity; or el&s;e break, grow deep, afford a yellow Mucus, or cor|ro&s;ive Sanies, and form Ulcers incurable by common Medicines. The&s;e afterwards increa&s;e in Number both externally and internally. The inguinal Glands &s;well, collect Matter, break of them&s;elves, and di&s;charge. Shankers, Verrucae, Porri, Mari&s;cae, Condylomata, Caruncles, Strangury, Ero&s;ion of the Urethra, and Parts adjacent. Stiffne&s;s in the Joints, and Pain of the Limbs. Ero&s;ion of the Cartilages. The Bones grow carious, and ri&s;e in &s;tubborn Apo&s;tems, corrupting the adjacent Parts. The Vi&s;cera mortify, and the Fle&s;h corrupts.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Di&s;temper is found to be communicated by Lactation, Sweat, Saliva, and Exhalation.</P>
<P N="3">3. From hence, it's Cau&s;e is a corro&s;ive Taint admitted into the Body, which gradually a&s;&s;imilates the Fluids to it &s;elf, corrupts the Solids, and becomes contagious by a Communication of the Fluids.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Specific wanting here is therefore &s;uch an one as will de&s;troy the force of this Corro&s;ive, or put a &s;top to the Contagion in the animal Flu|ids; which there is an opportunity of di&s;covering by the proper Ex|periments.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="36">
<P N="5">5. In the mean time, if we expect this &s;pecific Virtue from any known Medicament, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hou'd be u&s;ed as a Specific, that is, by &s;uf|fering it to be detain'd in the Body as long as po&s;&s;ible, to let it have it's utmo&s;t Effects upon the Solids and Fluids: And who can &s;ay that Mer|cury, thus properly manag'd, will not have &s;uch a &s;pecific Virtue?</P>
<P>This is a matter of no &s;mall moment, and certainly de&s;erves to be well examin'd; for if this rea&s;oning will hold good, it follows, that much Pain and Fatigue, very great Danger and Loath&s;omne&s;s, the nece&s;&s;ary attendants of a Salivation, are often undergone to no purpo&s;e, or el&s;e to a bad one; whil&s;t &s;uch a hazardous Method frequently failing to Cure the Di&s;ea&s;e, occa&s;ions it afterwards to pa&s;s for Incurable. In which Ca&s;e, this &s;pecific U&s;e of Mercury, may bid very fair for a Cure.</P>
<P>There is but one Objection, that I know of, can be made again&s;t this way of turning Mercury into a Specific, for the Cure of the Lues Venerea, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Venereal Taint or Virus, being plentifully evacuated by Salivation, as appears from the quantity and &s;tench of the Saliva, a con|trary way of proceeding will have a contrary Effect, and con&s;equently detain and lock up the Virus in the Body.</P>
<P>That &s;ome Portion of the Venereal Taint is evacuated with the Sa|liva in a Salivation, cannot be deny'd, any more than that &s;ome is likewi&s;e evacuated with the Urine, and other Excretions, &s;ince in both Ca&s;es the Virus will evidently manife&s;t it &s;elf by propagating the Contagion. 2. But that it is more plentifully evacuated by the Salivary Glands in the former Ca&s;e, than it wou'd be by the Renal in the latter, were proper Diureticks exhibited, may be ju&s;tly que&s;tion'd, if the &s;tench of the Saliva be no proof of it. But 'tis well known that the Saliva evacuated in the Salivation of a Per&s;on who is entirely free from any Venereal Taint, is equally fetid with that of a Venereal Patient.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Salivations have been oftentimes regularly rais'd, and prudently carried on, &s;o as to cau&s;e a very plentiful Excretion of fetid Sa|liva; but notwith&s;tanding this, the Lues has been left uncured: from whence it &s;hou'd appear that the Cure does not depend upon an eva|cuation
<PB N="33" REF="37">of ferid Saliva. Nor will this perhaps admit of a doubt, if it be remember'd that many, on the contrary, have been cured of the Lues, by Mercury, who cou'd never be brought to Salivate at all; and that others, whom upon account of &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;e of the Brea&s;t, or the like, it has not been thought prudent to venture under &s;o dangerous a Flux by the Mouth, have happily recover'd by this &s;pecific U&s;e of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And agreeable to this Doctrine is that Practice of the be&s;t Phy&s;icians, who even after the mo&s;t profu&s;e Flux by the Mouth, either exhibit pro|per Do&s;es of Mercury, during the &s;pace of &s;everal weeks after the Sa|livation is drop'd, without any De&s;ign to bring it on again; or el&s;e put the Patient into a Cour&s;e of &s;pecific Diet-Drink; as well knowing that unle&s;s &s;omewhat of this kind be done, the Patient is not &s;ecure, but runs the hazard of a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>'Tis evident that Mercury exhibited &s;o as to Purge or Salivate, cannot ex|ert its full Force upon the Body; becau&s;e by tho&s;e very Excretions it is &s;oon thrown out, as appears, in that it may be reviv'd from the Excrements and rein&s;tated in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its former Properties: If therefore we wou'd obtain the utmo&s;t Effects of this grand Medicament, ought it not by a prudent management to be detain'd, in a large quantity, as long as po&s;&s;ible in the Body? This Method alone, methinks, can determine whether Mer|cury will prove a true Specific for the Lues Venerea.</P>
<P>Moreover, &s;uch an U&s;e of Mercury is not only directed by the na|ture of the Di&s;ea&s;e, but by the &s;imilar Effects of other Remedies. The Lues Venerea is a very &s;tubborn and ob&s;tinate Di&s;temper, and where it once &s;ei&s;es, is with great difficulty removed; it &s;eems &s;trongly to adhere to the body, or rather it entangles it &s;elf &s;o as to become one with it, as appears particularly by its la&s;ting Effects after a partial Cure; (for Mercury as 'tis generally exhibited, only palliates, but &s;el|dom eradicates this Di&s;ea&s;e, as is well known to the more curious ob&s;ervers:) ought not then the Remedy al&s;o to be entangled and united with the Body, in order to exert its full Force, and be upon equal Terms with its Adver&s;ary? Thus we &s;ee every Day when the
<PB N="34" REF="38">Cortex, exhibited in an Intermittent, is evacuated by Stool, 'tis of no Effect towards curing the Di&s;ea&s;e, tho' admini&s;tred in a very large Quantity; but &s;top this Evacuation, let the Medicine remain in the Body, circulate with the Fluids, and exert it's full Force, it becomes a very different and va&s;tly more powerful Remedy than before, and ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be call'd a Specific.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Gout.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE chief Properties of the Gout are, to return generally in the Spring and Autumn. 2. Seldom to affect any but Men of a gro&s;s and corpulent Habit. 3. To &s;ucceed high Living, hard Study, vio|lent Exerci&s;e, the free U&s;e of Acids, and taking Cold on the Feet.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Fit is u&s;ually preceeded by Crudity, or rawne&s;s felt in the Sto|mach, heavine&s;s, Co&s;tivene&s;s, a &s;toppage of Sweat in the Feet, and by Va|rices.</P>
<P N="3">3. When regular, it &s;eizes the internal Parts of the Foot, its Perio&s;teum, Nerves, Membranes, Ligaments, and Tendons about the Joynts: And when irregular, that is, when it moves about or di&s;per&s;es it &s;elf, it always falls on the like membranous and nervous Parts.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Fit comes on with a ten&s;ive, burning, gnawing Pain, which in|crea&s;es gradually to it's height, then decrea&s;es, as the Part grows moi&s;t, red, and tumid.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Pain goes off in a Diaphore&s;is, leaving an Itching behind it.</P>
<P N="6">6. It &s;cales the Part, or bur&s;ting the Ve&s;&s;els, throws off a &s;olid cretaceous Matter.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'Tis more violent, as the Swelling is le&s;s, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The more &s;evere the Fit, the greater the Interval of its return, and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Does it not follow that the immediate Cau&s;e of the Gout, both in its knotty and &s;mooth Species, is a cretaceous Matter lodg'd in &s;ome ner|vous and membranous Part? For a Fit never cea&s;es 'till this Matter is thrown off in the former Species, and to &s;uppo&s;e a like Expul&s;ion in the latter, tho' made in a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible manner, fairly and naturally accounts for the other
<PB N="36" REF="40">Phaenomena, which are the &s;ame in both. It &s;hould follow therefore, that the&s;e two Ca&s;es differ only as the Cau&s;e happens to be more or le&s;s per&s;pirable, 3.4.5.6.</P>
<P N="10">10. Does not the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e lurk in the Body in the Ab&s;ence of a Fit? 1.7.8. If the Gout be ever properly hereditary, this is &s;till more evident.</P>
<P N="11">11. It appears that this Cau&s;e is depo&s;ited upon various Parts by the Fluids; 2. For the Solids never exchange Places; and con&s;equently the Fluids alone, in the Ab&s;ence of a Fit, are the Seat or Vehicle of this Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="12">12. This Cau&s;e upon many Occa&s;ions 1. is apt to &s;tagnate, or be depo|&s;ited in the &s;malle&s;t Canals, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t remote from the Brain and Heart, where the Circulation is languid, and the Parts are na|turally pre&s;&s;ed, contracted and le&s;s yielding, 3.</P>
<P N="13">13. This Matter is corro&s;ive 4.6.</P>
<P N="14">14. As the Ve&s;&s;els are more &s;tiff and rigid, 12. and the Matter more corro&s;ive and tenacious, 11.13. the Di&s;ea&s;e will be more &s;evere.</P>
<P N="15">15. Both the Solids and Fluids being concerned in the Fit, the Cure ought at that Time to regard them both: But in the Ab&s;ence of a Fit, the Cure need only regard the Alteration of the Fluids 11.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Cure then in the Ab&s;ence of a Fit, is to be effected, either by a proper Di&s;&s;olvent of a cretaceous Matter in the Fluids, or by pro|per Evacuation.</P>
<P N="17">17. Till the Specific can be found for this Ca&s;e, perhaps Evacuations might be contriv'd, to carry off the Semina of the Di&s;ea&s;e, during that large Interval (1.) which is u&s;ually interpos'd between two Fits; and by that Means a new Set of Fluids be procur'd, and a proper Regi|men and Remedies u&s;ed to prevent the future Generation of this Cau&s;e. For if the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in the Ab&s;ence of the Fit, exits in the Fluids, 11. and be equally di&s;per&s;ed in them, as there appears Rea&s;on, from the &s;uppos'd pre&s;ent State of Health, to believe; 'tis certain, that an Evacuation of Blood, at a large Orifice, would le&s;&s;en the Quantity of
<PB N="37" REF="41">this Cau&s;e in the Body: and could not Phlebotomy be &s;o manag'd, as to detract as much of it as would otherwi&s;e be thrown out by the en&s;uing Fit; and if &s;o, would not this prevent a Fit as effectually as the having undergone one? In the ab&s;ence of the Fit, the Body is &s;ound, and the Effects of moderate Phlebotomy on a &s;ound Body, we know are to le&s;&s;en the Quantity of the Blood, and rarify the remaining Part; to take off from the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Fluids, allow a more free Contraction of the Canals, and a Recovery of their Ela&s;ticity; to di&s;&s;olve Coagulations, to open Ob&s;tructions, and promote a free Circulation; and la&s;tly, to forward both Secretions and Excretions, and to allow of a Renovation of the Fluids or Ma&s;s of Blood. Now there are none of the&s;e Effects, taken &s;eparately or conjointly, but &s;eem of them&s;elves to have a direct Tendency to forward the Cure, provided the fir&s;t Dige&s;tion can be well &s;ecur'd, and Crudities in the others prevented; which greatly depending upon a prudent Choice of the Subject, and a proper Management during the U&s;e of the Remedy, no greater Objections will perhaps lie again&s;t this Method, where a Per&s;on is willing to pur&s;ue it, than are to be pro|duc'd again&s;t other approv'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Forms of Procedure in other Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Phlebotomy, after the manner propos'd, has never that I know of, been try'd by Way of Prevention or Cure of the Gout, though in the Rheu|mati&s;m, an acknowledg'd &s;imilar Ca&s;e, it frequently has with very good Succe&s;s; and is one of the be&s;t known Methods of Cure, for that Di|&s;temper. And the &s;ame Operation, when perform'd in the common Manner, or u&s;ed as an A&s;&s;i&s;tant in the Cure of the Gout, has &s;ome|times been found of Service. But as this Ca&s;e has &s;eldom been pre|&s;crib'd to by Phy&s;icians of Judgment, it being always look'd upon as In|curable, or &s;uch a Di&s;ea&s;e as was render'd wor&s;e by the U&s;e of Phy&s;ic, it has fallen almo&s;t entirely to the Management of Empiricks, from who&s;e Practice I will not, in a Ca&s;e of &s;o great Nicety, venture to draw a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the&s;e few Examples are propos'd by Way of Specimen, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that it did not &s;uit with the Nature of the De&s;ign, to enu|merate
<PB N="38" REF="42">all the Properties and Phonomena of every Di&s;ea&s;e, under its re|&s;pective Title, tho' there may perhaps be commonly enow from whence to deduce their immediate Cau&s;e, and a &s;uitable Method of Cure. Nor are all the po&s;&s;ible Advantages taken of what Properties are &s;et down, upon account of the de&s;ign'd Brevity of this Di&s;cour&s;e. It ought not therefore to be attributed to neglect, that under <HI>Madne&s;s,</HI> no No|tice was taken, of what Service a prudent Exhibition of the Cortex, Sal, Ab&s;inth. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might be, during the U&s;e of the particular Remedy, there recommended; nor any Mention made of the proper Ways of en|deavouring to reduce the Mind to its natural State: Nor again how advanta|gious, deep Inci&s;ions, frequent Scarifications, &s;trong Attractives, actual Caute|ries, powerful Dige&s;tives, &s;harp Corro&s;ives, proper Lotions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Bite of a <HI>mad-Dog:</HI> How u&s;eful &s;trong &s;timulating Remedies in the <HI>Pal&s;y;</HI> or what better Methods than the common, there are of treating the inveterate or confirm'd <HI>Lues Venerea:</HI> Nor la&s;tly, of what Ser|vice a Cour&s;e of Relaxatives, Per&s;piratives, Sudorificks, Corroboratives, Stomachicks, or a Salivation in the <HI>Gout;</HI> or the mo&s;t proper Method of treating that Di&s;ea&s;e during the Fit, though the Properties mention'd will lead to it.</P>
<P>Much le&s;s could it be expected, that the Diet, Regimen, and Medi|cines requi&s;ite, or u&s;eful in each Proce&s;s, &s;hould be there in&s;i&s;ted on, which would be to have &s;well'd a Volume upon each Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Thus then have I done what I at fir&s;t props'd; which was only to offer at &s;ome probable Means to improve the Phy&s;ical Practice with Regard to inveterate Ca&s;es, or &s;uch as are unde&s;ervedly &s;til'd Incurable; in hopes, at the &s;ame Time, to wipe off &s;ome Part of that Reproach, which has fallen on the Art of Healing, through a Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s to cul|tivate &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial a Part of it. I am &s;en&s;ible how lit|tle I have contributed to &s;o great a Work, yet if this imperfect Sketch may happen to give Occa&s;ion to a due Pro&s;ecution of the De&s;ign, I &s;hall not repent that I ventured to communicate &s;o &s;lender a Perfor|mance to the Public.</P>
