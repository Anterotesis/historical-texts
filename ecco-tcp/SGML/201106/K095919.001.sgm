<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU make me happy, by &s;aying that my letters afford you comfort. How often have I been on the point of throwing them in the fire, le&s;t their gaiety &s;hould &s;eem to impeach my &s;en&s;ibility of your mis|fortunes. If I have con&s;oled you, I believe it was by not attempting to offer you con|&s;olation.
<PB N="2" REF="4">I have not, with the cruel in&s;o|lence of cold philo&s;ophy, pretended to a&s;|&s;ign rea&s;ons why you &s;hould not grieve for the lo&s;s of an amiable hu&s;band; fir&s;t alienated by cau&s;ele&s;s jealou&s;y, and then &s;natched away by an early and untimely death! My dear &s;i&s;ter, I have left you to rea&s;on&mdash;I have left you to Heaven! You know as well as I, that grief is unavailing, that it ought to be &s;truggled with; and I am &s;ure you do &s;truggle; but, alas! the feelings of the heart are not always obedient to the dictates of rea&s;on: or why cannot I conquer a hope|le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion? Why does my heart revolt again&s;t the friend&s;hip I have vowed to Va|leria O'Bryen? a friend&s;hip, &s;he in no way de&s;erves to forfeit. True, &s;he has deeply injured me; but 'twas without de&s;ign. She knew not that I loved St. Clair, and, O pride forbid that &s;he ever &s;hould know it.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, very ju&s;tly, <Q>If the marquis de St. Clair once loved you, you ought now to de&s;pi&s;e him for his incon&s;tancy: if he never loved you, he never ought to enter your thoughts.</Q> Very true, Harriet; very true. But did I ever tell you that I
<PB N="3" REF="5">believed I did <HI>right</HI> to love him? No, I am &s;en&s;ible of the folly of my attachment; yet cannot even re&s;olve to overcome it. I am not accu&s;tomed to re&s;train my pa&s;&s;ions. From the time I came under the care of my uncle and aunt de Villemar, to this mo|ment, I have not been u&s;ed to the lea&s;t con|tradiction. It appears ungenerous&mdash;per|haps, in this ca&s;e, it is ungrateful&mdash;to plead the faults of others as an excu&s;e for my own; but I cannot help thinking I &s;hould have had more firmne&s;s of mind, and more command over my pa&s;&s;ions, if I had been educated le&s;s tenderly.</P>
<P>You reprove me for mentioning people you never heard of, as familiarly as if I thought you acquainted with them: and then you a&s;k&mdash;&s;hall I &s;ay, you have the cruelty to a&s;k&mdash;Who is this Mi&s;s O'Bryen? and who is Lady Enmore? I &s;uppo&s;e you expect to have your que&s;tions an&s;wered. Well, I will gratify you. Let us proceed methodically: I know you love method.</P>
<P>When I was in the country la&s;t &s;ummer, Lady Enmore, her daughter, and Mi&s;s O'Bryen, arrived here from Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Lady Enmore, who it &s;eems pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of her youth in France, was formerly an acquaintance of my aunt's; and on my return to town I found them ex|tremely intimate.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip &s;eems to be about fifty, and is a genteel, plea&s;ing woman.</P>
<P>Lady Mary Enmore is an ill-natured, envious, ugly, deformed little creature: ac|compli&s;hed, &s;en&s;ible, and &s;hrewd; but in|tolerably &s;elf-&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s O'Bryen is&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he is&mdash; the fine&s;t woman I ever &s;aw. La belle Ir|landoi&s;e! the men here call her.</P>
<P>Her father was an Iri&s;h baronet; who being on a vi&s;it to &s;ome friends in England, in the neighbourhood of one of the Duke of Granville's country &s;eats, fell in love with Lady Charlotte Sedley, only daughter to his Grace. Sir William was hand&s;ome, wild, and profu&s;e; qualities which too often engage our thoughtle&s;s &s;ex. He &s;oon in&s;i|nuated him&s;elf into Lady Charlotte's affec|tions. Her father, however, rejected his propo&s;als with an irritating haughtine&s;s.
<PB N="5" REF="7">Though gay and thoughtle&s;s, he was proud to exce&s;s; and could ill &s;upport treatment he thought &s;o injurious. Provoking ex|pre&s;&s;ions en&s;ued on both &s;ides. The Duke forbade him his hou&s;e, and commanded his daughter never to &s;ee him more.</P>
<P>Lady Charlotte, divided between love and duty, yielded&mdash;as is, perhaps, gene|rally the ca&s;e in &s;uch conflicts&mdash;to love! and fled to Ireland with Sir William.</P>
<P>After her marriage, &s;he made many in|effectual attempts to reconcile her&s;elf to her family. She had no mother to plead for her; and her father was &s;o &s;evere as even to forbid her only brother, Lord Cari&s;brook, to hold any corre&s;pondence with her.</P>
<P>Valeria O'Bryen, the &s;ole offspring of this marriage, was left an orphan, at &s;even|teen. Her parents died within a &s;hort time of each other; leaving her tenderly and li|berally educated, accu&s;tomed to elegance and profu&s;ion, without any other depend|ance than the friend&s;hip of Mrs. Chetwynd, Sir William's &s;i&s;ter, who is married to a clergyman. However, as they are very worthy
<PB N="6" REF="8">people, and, fortunately for her, have no children of their own, &s;he probably has not much rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied at her lot. With them &s;he has lived about three years, and is come here merely for amu&s;ement, with Lady Enmore, who is Mrs. Chet|wynd's very particular friend.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip has &s;hewn her friend&s;hip very much, at the expence of her di&s;cre|tion, in providing &s;uch a companion for her daughter. I imagine, that if Lady Mary had been left to her&s;elf, &s;he would not have made &s;o imprudent a choice. Yet if &s;he has not, like me, had every fondly-cheri&s;h|ed hope bla&s;ted by the charms of this fatal O'Bryen, I know not how &s;he can &s;hut her heart again&s;t &s;uch an amiable di&s;po&s;ition! &s;uch &s;educing manners!</P>
<P>Ever &s;uperior to envy, I &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;h|ed her. I &s;ought her for my friend. Fool that I was! I could not live without her. It was at the hotel de Villemar, &s;he was fir&s;t &s;een by St. Clair.</P>
<P>I tire you, my Harriet. I will quit this &s;ubject; but I cannot write on any other. I know not what is become of all tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="9">agreeable nothings, that u&s;ed to pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my imagination with &s;o much facility. Adieu.</P>

<P>YES, you are in the right, my dear Mrs. Chetwynd; your Valeria has&mdash;</P>
<Q>"Set the world on fire!"</Q>
<P>The ringlets that &s;hade her &s;nowy fore|head, are not &s;o numerous as the &s;ighing &s;wains that compo&s;e her train;</P>
<Q><L>"While her high pride does &s;carce de&s;cend</L>
<L>"To mark their follies.</L></Q>
<P>Seriou&s;ly, my dear Caroline, this lovely creature. although &s;he has not an atom of vanity, is rather too lofty. Allow me to &s;ay, that &s;he has rather too much of her fa|ther in her di&s;po&s;ition. She has lately re|fu&s;ed two very advantageous matches: her objections, which I took the liberty to a&s;k, were quite frivolous and romantic. This minute, I expatiate on the enjoyments of a &s;plendid fortune; the next, I threaten her with willow garlands, leading apes, &amp;c. but all to no purpo&s;e; &s;he &s;miles, equally
<PB N="9" REF="11">unmoved, at both pleas. However, I am not without hopes that the marquis de St. Clair will, in time, find means to warm her icy heart. She &s;eems already to prefer him to all his competitors. I have exerted my utmo&s;t influence in his favour; but all I could obtain for him, was a promi&s;e of not immediately refu&s;ing him.</P>
<P>I told the marquis I &s;hould write to Mi&s;s O'Bryen's friends: and I ventured to a&s;&s;ure him, he would find them his zealous advo|cates.</P>
<P>Now, I earne&s;tly recommend it to you, to write immediately, and <HI>&s;trongly,</HI> to your niece on this &s;ubject. She cannot make one rea&s;onable objection to St. Clair. He bears an univer&s;al good character; he is po|lite, hand&s;ome, very rich, and of a noble extraction.</P>
<P>If this marriage takes place, you may leave every thing to my management; and depend upon my acting for your Valeria, as I &s;hould for my own daughter.</P>

<HEAD>To the COUNTESS DOWAGER ENMORE.&mdash;FRANCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>CHETWYND VILLA.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE great obligations to you, my dear friend, for your care of my lovely child. I have written to her, according to your de&s;ire; as &s;trongly too, as I thought I ought. Your lady&s;hip mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible there would be an indelicacy in my urging her to marry. Would it not &s;eem as if I want|ed to be freed from my charge? How &s;uch a thought would wound her high &s;pirit!</P>
<P>I had another rea&s;on for not pre&s;&s;ing Va|leria on this &s;ubject: the marquis may not be the kind of man with whom &s;he could think her&s;elf happy. I have the highe&s;t re|&s;pect for your lady&s;hip's judgment: without que&s;tion you are abundantly capable of di&s;|tingui&s;hing an amiable man; but Valeria, her&s;elf, can alone di&s;tingui&s;h the man in who&s;e &s;ociety &s;he might wi&s;h to &s;pend her life. A man may be worthy, and not plea&s;|ing; he may be plea&s;ing, and yet want &s;omething we cannot di&s;pen&s;e with. In
<PB N="11" REF="13">&s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to explain the &s;ecret magic, that draws our affection to one man more than to another; although it is probable even our partial &s;elves do not di&s;cover any extraordinary merit in that dear one. We feel the <HI>tout-en-&s;emble</HI> irre&s;i&s;tible, without being able to define the particular charms that attract us. I have often thought that parents do not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider the im|portance of this point. When they have provided a young man of a good family, &s;uitable fortune, and fair character&mdash;truly, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary!&mdash;and if to the&s;e advantages he adds a tolerable &s;hare of beauty and agreeablene&s;s, the poor girl is downright perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate, if &s;he does not immediately fall in love with him. Yet were &s;he to give her heart without their knowledge, to one fifty times more engag|ing, no reproaches would be thought ade|quate to her mi&s;conduct. Is not this to &s;up|po&s;e love quite voluntary? when Heaven knows, it is not always in a young per&s;on's power to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> her heart; it never is to <HI>be&s;tow</HI> it. For my part, I think tho&s;e who love improperly, have many excu&s;es; and
<PB N="12" REF="14">tho&s;e who do not love where they are im|portuned, want none.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t&mdash;pardon the peremptorine&s;s of the expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon your leaving my niece entirely to her own direction in the important point before us. O may the on|ly direction &s;uperior to her own, be vouch|&s;afed to her! I confe&s;s to you, I cannot re|concile my&s;elf to the thought of her being &s;ettled in France. Both Mr. Chetwynd and I have &s;et our hearts upon this girl. Far from repining at our not having chil|dren, we are plea&s;ed at a circum&s;tance that will enable us to provide the more amply for our darling.</P>
<P>Never, Lady Enmore, never will that &s;olemn &s;cene be era&s;ed from my memory, when the dear child was committed to my care by her la&s;t &s;urviving parent.</P>
<P>"My poor Valeria!" &s;aid he, gazing on her mournfully, as &s;he knelt, weeping by his bed; <Q>My poor child! I have undone you! I have made you a beggar&mdash;a de|pendant! Mu&s;t my daughter de&s;cend to &s;erve up&s;tart greatne&s;s for bread?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
"She never &s;hall!" &s;aid I, with firm|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Dear Sir William," &s;oftly interpo&s;ed my Charles, <Q>I be&s;eech you to be calm. O let no anxious thought for Valeria di&s;|turb the peace of &s;uch an hour as this! Be a&s;&s;ured, that in me &s;he will find a fa|ther. Is not Caroline already her mo|ther?</Q></P>
<P>"My dear, lo&s;t Charlotte!" cried my brother, with a heart-rending &s;igh; <Q>Lo&s;t, perhaps, to all eternity! I do not de|&s;erve to participate your bli&s;s. My fol|lies opened an early grave for you! My extravagance has beggared your child!</Q></P>
<P><Q>You have, indeed, been extravagant and unthinking,</Q> &s;aid Mr. Chetwynd. <Q>This is not a time to palliate your errors. But I tru&s;t that a merciful Being will not too &s;everely mark a fooli&s;h prodigality, that brought its puni&s;hment here. As a hu&s;band, and a father, you were affec|tionate and indulgent. A &s;incere friend &mdash;a better brother&mdash;</Q> cried Charles, &s;queezing his hand, "no man ever was."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
"Your voice, my dear Chetwynd," re|plied Sir William, <Q>is ever the voice of comfort. As a brother, indeed, I have nothing to reproach my&s;elf with; not even to the brother, who&s;e too great anxi|ety for what I have valued too little, has ruined my affairs; who&s;e unkindne&s;s, perhaps, has not a little contributed to make that child an orphan.</Q></P>
<P>"While I live," &s;aid I, &s;carely able to &s;peak, "Valeria is not quite an orphan."</P>
<P><Q>Give me your hand, my amiable, my beloved Caroline!</Q> &s;aid my dying bro|ther; "and yours, my dear Charles." We each of us put one of our hands in both his. <Q>To you, my friends, I leave Valeria&mdash; a &s;acred tru&s;t!&mdash;a beque&s;t, of which only minds like yours know the value.</Q></P>
<P>We gave him the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances, that it &s;hould be the bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives to protect and cher&s;h his Valeria.</P>
<P>Mr. Chetwynd rai&s;ed the fainting Valeria in his arms.</P>
<P>"Poor child!" &s;aid her father.&mdash;I can|not give you an idea of the pathos with which he pronounced that&mdash;"Poor child!"</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
"Caroline," &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, <Q>let her know, as &s;he values my la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, &s;he mu&s;t never accept any thing from the duke of Granville. If I mu&s;t leave my daughter dependant, I have, at lea&s;t, the con&s;olation to think &s;he will depend on my <HI>own family.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I do not, my dear lady Enmore, defend &s;uch re&s;entful pride at &s;uch a time. But he probably called to mind, that the gentle lady Charlotte had often &s;aid,&mdash;<Q>Dear Va|leria, &s;hould you ever &s;ee my father, on your knees intreat him not to cur&s;e my memory!</Q>&mdash;and he feared, not without rea&s;on, that the haughty duke, whom he hated, would look upon this mournful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion as the abject &s;cheme of want.</P>
<P>It is highly probable that poor lady Char|lotte, who too well knew the de&s;perate &s;ituation of her hu&s;band's affairs, did by this means intend to recommend her child to the care of her father; and &s;uch conduct in her was very natural and laudable. The duke, notwith&s;tanding his over-&s;trained pride, and dete&s;table implacability, is a man of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
My dear brother &s;urvived this melancholy &s;cene but two days; and I bore my droop|ing ward from O'Bryen Ca&s;tle, &s;o many centuries the re&s;idence of her ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Although my e&s;teem for my younger brother, was wholly de&s;troyed by his rigor|ous exaction of the large &s;ums, his par&s;i|mony had enabled him to lend Sir William, yet it was a &s;atisfaction to my family pride, to &s;ee him become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of O'Bryen Ca&s;tle, rather than any other creditor.</P>
<P>I &s;hared with my Valeria a &s;atisfaction of a better kind, when I &s;aw that the &s;hattered remains of her father's fortune were &s;uffi|cient to pay his debts.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of an excellent mother; of a kind, though an imprudent father; the total di&s;appointment of her ju&s;t expectations of affluence:&mdash;The&s;e were not gentle trials for a girl of &s;eventeen. But what &s;he felt with &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he bore with fortitude.</P>
<P>O, lady' Enmore, &s;he is the pride of my heart! the delight of my life! You know not what I feel at the thought of her being &s;eparated from me. But I mu&s;t not, will not be &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
I can by no means agree with your lady|&s;hip, that my dear child <Q>has too much of her father in her di&s;po&s;ition.</Q> She does re&s;emble him; but not <HI>too much.</HI> She has Sir William's lofty &s;oul, generous &s;pirit, high pa&s;&s;ions, and piercing wit; with a &s;till deeper penetration, and a much more &s;olid judgment than he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. <HI>His</HI> lof|tine&s;s was pride: <HI>her</HI>'s is dignity. <HI>He</HI> &s;pent a noble fortune in &s;upporting an extravagant parade; and gave to tho&s;e that a&s;ked, ra|ther than to them that wanted: <HI>&s;he</HI> knows how to &s;teer between the extremes of ava|rice and prodigality; and is careful to exer|ci&s;e her beneficence on proper objects. Her high pa&s;&s;ions do not govern <HI>her;</HI> her rea&s;on governs <HI>them. His</HI> wit was not under the check of di&s;cretion; it was often ill-natured; a two-edged &s;word, that at once wounded his neighbour and him&s;elf: <HI>her</HI>'s is exerted only to amu&s;e, never to give pain; its &s;e|verity is pointed again&s;t <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> and <HI>folly,</HI> not again&s;t the <HI>vicious,</HI> or the <HI>weak:</HI> or if &s;he does attack the vicious, the weak her generous tongue never a&s;&s;aulted. Is &s;he not careful to give due prai&s;e to the amiable
<PB N="18" REF="20">part of the character? When did Valeria expo&s;e a per&s;onal defect, a natural imper|fection? To conclude, Valeria is her fa|ther's picture; but the picture is &s;ofter, &s;weeter, has more grace and elegance than the original.</P>
<P>I intreat your lady&s;hip's forgivene&s;s, if I have &s;eemed over-forward to contradict your &s;entiments, throughout this tedious letter. You know I am a plain-dealer, and always &s;peak my opinion; a liberty I think very con&s;i&s;tent with our friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>HOW, in the name of every thing mar|vellous, did St. Clair procure your intere&s;t? Sure the man has &s;ome familiar &s;pirit to run of his errands! A &s;ylph, I &s;uppo&s;e; no &s;pirit le&s;s pure dared approach you. Ah! my good lady Enmore, I fancy you are at the bottom of this affair. It does not plea&s;e my aunt to &s;ay who was her intelligencer; yet &s;he accu&s;es me of over-re&s;ervedne&s;s. How could you &s;ay I &s;eemed to want confi|dence in you? My be&s;t, my deare&s;t friend! whom &s;hould I confide in but you? You know your Valeria would not a&s;&s;ert an un|truth; and I a&s;&s;ure you, on my honour, the only rea&s;on I did not acquaint you with the addre&s;&s;es I am tormented with, was the ap|prehen&s;ion of your imputing the communi|cation of them to my vanity. Have you not ob&s;erved, how fond &s;ome women&mdash;and perhaps &s;ome men too&mdash;are of publi&s;hing their conque&s;ts? I have been made the confidante of a great many young ladies,
<PB N="20" REF="22">who I am certain had not the lea&s;t friend&s;hip for me; but told me their affairs, merely to let me know they were admired. When any of my female acquaintance tell me, that my lord, or Mr. &s;uch-a-one, is in love with them, but that they would not have it men|tioned for the world, I am the only per&s;on they would tru&s;t to, &amp;c.; I conclude what they mean to &s;ay is, <Q>I &s;hall be obliged to you for a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to make this matter as much known as po&s;&s;ible.</Q> And ac|cordingly I have found, that the be&s;t way to get rid of &s;uch trifling communications, is to keep them &s;ecret. Excu&s;e me, if my contempt for a conduct &s;o wretchedly vain and ridiculous, has thrown me rather into the oppo&s;ite extreme.</P>
<P>You tell me I have a great many lovers I do not mention to you: true,</P>
<Q>I've praters, and &s;uitors, and danglers great &s;tore.</Q>
<P>But they are a &s;et of in&s;ignificants, I have not the con&s;cience to take up your attention with. However, that you may not again call me re&s;erved, we'll ju&s;t take a look at
<PB N="21" REF="23">two of them, lady Enmore thought me imprudent to refu&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>En premier lieu,</HI> Mon&s;ieur le compte de Chaumont, a tall, lean man, of about fifty; who&s;e greate&s;t ambition, next to plea&s;ing me, is to be thought a gay, foppi&s;h young fellow: a fop he is; his bittere&s;t enemy cannot deny it; and if he would be con|tented to conver&s;e only with the blind, he might be thought young, indeed! but <HI>mon vieillard</HI> would plea&s;e both the eyes and ears, and &s;o, alas! plea&s;es neither; verify|ing the proverb, "Gra&s;p all, lo&s;e all." <Q>What could recommend this count to lady Enmore?</Q> you a&s;k. Be it far from me to di&s;play the bad only; though I could find precedents. Let us turn to the bright &s;ide; bright it mu&s;t be owned&mdash;Noble de|&s;cent, large fortune, &s;plendid equipage, court favour. Agreeable trifles the&s;e, if joined to &s;ome more &s;olid advantages. It is need|le&s;s to ob&s;erve, to a per&s;on of your ju&s;t and refined way of thinking, how very little it is in the power of &s;uch extrin&s;ic merit in a hu&s;band, to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of a wo|man, who pretends to any &s;entiment.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DEFERRED communicating my re|&s;olutions with regard to the marquis de St. Clair, becau&s;e I did not well know them my&s;elf. I am little le&s;s to &s;eek than ever: I cannot bring my&s;elf either to accept or refu&s;e him. How like a coquet this! I have hitherto been above the meanne&s;s and cruelty of playing with the happine&s;s of a man that loved me: it lowers me very much in my own e&s;teem, to find my&s;elf ca|pable of it now.</P>
<P>Were St. Clair to live in Ireland, I be|lieve I &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment; but I cannot bear the thought of &s;ettling at &s;uch a di&s;tance from my dear uncle and you.</P>
<P>You tell me, that to give my hand to the marquis, unle&s;s I can give him my whole heart, will be making my&s;elf unhappy, and acting a di&s;honourable part towards him. You likewi&s;e ju&s;tly cen&s;ure the gro&s;s notion, of marrying fir&s;t, and loving afterwards. I
<PB N="25" REF="27">entirely agree with you in all this. I have a rea&s;onable regard for my own happine&s;s; I would rather die than do a di&s;honourable thing by any one. But here re&s;ts the diffi|culty &mdash;Do I, or do I not, love him?"</P>
<P><Q>Surely, Valeria, it is you mu&s;t an&s;wer that que&s;tion!</Q></P>
<P>True, my dear aunt; but hone&s;tly, and &s;eriou&s;ly, I don't know how to an&s;wer it. I really think him very amiable; and cer|tainly prefer him&mdash;I &s;hould not deliberate if I did not&mdash;to all the men I ever knew. I like his conver&s;ation; except when he im|portunes me on a certain &s;ubject. I am generally be&s;t plea&s;ed when he is pre&s;ent; and &s;ometimes regret his ab&s;ence. I pity him more tenderly than I do any other man, to whom I am unhappy enough to give pain.</P>
<Q>"Tell me, my heart, if this be love?"</Q>
<P>If I form my opinion of that pa&s;&s;ion, from what I have read of it in novels, I &s;hall be obliged to pronounce my &s;entiments for the marquis, only&mdash;friend&s;hip; for I am po&s;itive if he were to for&s;ake me this
<PB N="26" REF="28">moment, and even to wed another, I &s;hould pre&s;erve my rea&s;on; yes, and my peace of mind too! Yet, I confe&s;s, his dereliction would &s;en&s;ibly pique, and perhaps wound me.</P>
<P>Love, it &s;eems, can ob&s;erve no faults in &mdash;or at lea&s;t glo&s;&s;es over the faults of&mdash;its object. Now, I think St. Clair wants vi|vacity; and, if the expre&s;&s;ion be not too bold, fire! There is a &s;oft gentlene&s;s in his manners, that would be more &s;uitable to a female character, and might be in&s;ipid even in that. I would not be &s;uppo&s;ed to like roughne&s;s; no, not in the lea&s;t approach to it; but I would have a certain degree of life and &s;pirit accompany the &s;oftne&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>Thus have I ingenuou&s;ly told you the &s;tate of my heart. Let my dear parents de|termine for me. I &s;hall remain in &s;u&s;pen&s;e till your advice turns the balance; and it is in your power to turn it to which &s;ide you plea&s;e. If you would be happier&mdash;and your unbounded tenderne&s;s gives me room to imagine you would&mdash;in my living with you, &s;peak the word: I &s;hall in&s;tantly break
<PB N="27" REF="29">off this match; I &s;hall return to dear Ire|land, and my beloved friends. This la&s;t re&s;olution will &s;urprize you. To &s;ay the truth, I begin&mdash;or rather continue&mdash;to &s;igh at our long &s;eparation. Be&s;ides, my &s;itua|tion here is a little di&s;agreeable. I plainly &s;ee lady Mary Enmore hates me; &s;he does not treat me with incivility; but I ea&s;ily read her &s;entiments for me notwith&s;tanding. She is unhappy when in the &s;ame party with me; imagining the unde&s;ired court that is paid me, a &s;light to her. It mu&s;t appear vain in me to impute her di&s;like to envy; yet I don't know how otherwi&s;e to account for it. I have carefully examined into my be|haviour to her, and flatter my&s;elf with im|partiality in &s;aying, it de&s;erved a very dif|ferent return.</P>
<P>Lady Enmore's friend&s;hip is almo&s;t as unplea&s;ing in its con&s;equences, as her daughter's hatred: &s;he is continually teazing me to marry. <Q>Certainly, Mi&s;s O'Bryen, you are very young, and very hand&s;ome;</Q> &mdash;you'll pardon my repeating her own words&mdash;<Q>and yet you may never have &s;uch another offer.</Q> This &s;peech was
<PB N="28" REF="30">fir&s;t made for Chaumont, then d'Olonne, and is now repeated, at lea&s;t twice a day, for St. Clair. Re&s;pect to her more advanced years, and gratitude for her affection, obliges me to attend to her advice; and I don't know any thing more irk&s;ome, than to be forced to li&s;ten to coun&s;els one is predeter|mined not to follow. She is undoubtedly a &s;en&s;ible woman; I greatly e&s;teem her, as well on account of her per&s;onal merit, as her being your friend; but her di&s;po&s;ition, and notions of things, are &s;o oppo&s;ite to mine, that &s;he is by no means qualified to judge for me in &s;o important a point. Indeed, her lady&s;hip wants a little of my dear aunt's delicacy. Were I to put my&s;elf under her direction, I &s;hould be quite a female for|tune-hunter. How would you like, ma|dam, to &s;ee your girl a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a charac|ter; to be continually <HI>on the catch</HI>&mdash;allow me that expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;endeavouring to make her fortune by her per&s;on?&mdash;O, villainous! What a conduct!&mdash;It would ab&s;olutely be uncha&s;te!</P>
<P>Lady Enmore has ju&s;t told me, &s;he is re&s;olved not to importune me any more on
<PB N="29" REF="31">the marquis's account. <Q>I &s;hall leave you entirely to your&s;elf, my dear;</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>becau&s;e I am convinced you cannot be &s;uch a fool as to refu&s;e him.</Q> This is an odd way of leaving me to my&s;elf. I told her I had &s;ubmitted the matter to your de|ci&s;ion; at which &s;he is very well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I have written &s;eparately to my dear un|cle; not to exclude him from my confi|dence, but becau&s;e I thought cu&s;toms, laws, &amp;c. would have made an awkward appen|dix to &s;uch a letter as this. I have an&s;wered his &s;everal que&s;tions, according to the be&s;t information I could procure. If I have plea&s;ed him, I &s;hall be happy; if not, put on a &s;aucy look for me, and tell him he was mighty curious to give me &s;o much trouble about things that did not concern either of us.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>PARIS.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your letter, my dear &s;i&s;ter, and am determined to accept your invitation. I know my uncle and aunt will be unwilling to let me go; but they are too indulgent to deny me, when they find I have &s;et my heart on it. I &s;hall plead my impatience to &s;ee you, after a &s;eparation of near five years; my de&s;ire to behold a bro|ther, of whom I have &s;o &s;light a remem|brance. Here they will tell me, that Sir Edward has given us hopes of &s;eeing him at Paris next &s;ummer; and I &s;hall promi&s;e to return with him.</P>
<P>I would not, on any account, remain here one month longer, after the conver&s;a|tion I had ye&s;terday with lady Mary En|more. A re&s;tle&s;s curio&s;ity&mdash;perhaps a la|tent hope&mdash;prompted me to make an en|quiry, that has ended, as I might have &s;uppo&s;ed it would, in de&s;pair! I did not dare to mention the marquis's name to
<PB N="31" REF="33">Mi&s;s O'Bryen; her piercing eyes &s;eem to read one's very &s;oul; but, affecting an air of carele&s;s vivacity, I ventured to a&s;k lady Mary, if her fair companion was not &s;oon to be married to Mon&s;ieur de St. Clair. She replied, <Q>I believe &s;o; Mrs. Chetwynd has been written to.</Q> I could hardly &s;tand this &s;hock, though I thought I had fortified my mind again&s;t it. I am afraid I did not entirely conceal my emotion from lady Mary: &s;he looked I don't know how at me; &s;he even had the in&s;olence to &s;neer. I wi&s;h to Heaven I had been &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I went this morning to lady Enmore's; hoping, by an a&s;&s;umed &s;prightline&s;s, to de|&s;troy lady Mary's &s;u&s;picions. They were abroad. I waited for them. My &s;pirits began to flag: I &s;at down to the harp&s;ichord, and played and &s;ung, that I might not <HI>think!</HI> It would not do;&mdash;a flood of tears interrupted the &s;ong. What &s;hould become of me, were they to return at this mo|ment? The reflection in&s;tantly rou&s;ed me. I &s;tarted up, walked about the room, re|covered my&s;elf, and &s;at down again. Turn|ing over the leaves of a mu&s;ic book, I
<PB N="32" REF="34">found &s;ome tolerable ver&s;es, addre&s;&s;ed to lady Mary on her &s;inging:&mdash;<HI>&ocirc; ciel!</HI> that any man &s;hould think it worth his while to flatter lady Mary Enmore! I recollected her behaviour to me ye&s;terday, and could not deny my&s;elf the &s;mall revenge of &s;crib|bling a very &s;atyrical couplet on the oppo|&s;ite page. I hope the lines will vex her. Perhaps &s;he may di&s;cover the author, though I endeavoured to di&s;gui&s;e my hand. I care not if &s;he does: let her remember her barbarous <HI>&s;neer.</HI> Why is not Valeria O'Bryen &s;uch a creature as lady Mary En|more, that my mean jealou&s;y might not be wholly without excu&s;e? I hate my&s;elf for my ingratitude to the woman, with whom I have interchanged the tendere&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. She has long &s;ince perceived the melancholy I took &s;o much pains to hide; and her generous and tender a&s;&s;iduity, in con&s;equence of that di&s;|covery, wounds me to the &s;oul. She once hinted a de&s;ire to know the cau&s;e of my unea&s;ine&s;s. You may believe &s;he was the la&s;t per&s;on I &s;hould have cho&s;en for a con|fidante. I was forced to give her an eva|&s;ive
<PB N="33" REF="35">an&s;wer: &s;he did not pre&s;s me; but, with a delicacy peculiar to her&s;elf, &s;he im|mediately changed the &s;ubject, and has ne|ver &s;ince renewed it. Why cannot I love her?</P>
<P>It is late; I am fatigued and &s;leepy; I &s;hall lay down my pen; but I am re&s;olved not to clo&s;e this letter till I have obtained permi&s;&s;ion to go to England.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>Why do they oppo&s;e my going? I can|not, will not, &s;tay here. I am di&s;gu&s;ted with this place, and every body in it. I hate the woman I ought to love; and I de|&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf! I am ju&s;t returned from vi|&s;iting Madame de Carignan. She had a good deal of company; Mi&s;s O'Bryen was mentioned; every one &s;aid &s;omething in her favour. My envious heart died within me. I &s;at &s;ullenly &s;ilent, while her prai&s;es were echoed from mouth to mouth, as if the company had been in a con&s;piracy to puni&s;h me&mdash;as I de&s;erve. O, how has this pa&s;&s;ion narrowed my mind! There was a
<PB N="34" REF="36">time, when I &s;hould have received plea&s;ure from &s;uch a conver&s;ation. Still I am not &s;o far lo&s;t to ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity, but that I am ready to acknowledge, &s;he is the fir&s;t of women. In &s;hort, I prai&s;e her my&s;elf, but cannot endure to hear her prai&s;ed by an|other. Were &s;he cen&s;ured, I could li&s;ten with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, and &s;hould warmly defend her, notwith&s;tanding:&mdash;what con|temptible caprice!</P>
<P>Adieu. I have not yet relinqui&s;hed the &s;weet hope of &s;eeing you.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>After two day's &s;truggle I have prevailed. Now you, my gentle &s;i&s;ter, would have given up any plea&s;ure, rather than have endured &s;o long a contention: I &s;ee there are &s;ome advantages attending ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>You may expect to &s;ee me very &s;oon. My uncle intends putting me under the protection of Mr. Domville; who talks of quitting France every day. He is an Eng|li&s;h gentleman, brother to Lord Linfield, married about two years ago to lady Lucy

<P>How weak I am! Would you believe it,&mdash;I can hardly bear the thought of leav|ing this place, though I would not &s;tay in it for the world: though I die to embrace you, though I long to &s;ee the brother on who&s;e prai&s;e I have heard you dwell with &s;o much rapture&mdash;but, &s;till, St. Clair is here; and, as yet, St. Clair is free.</P>
<P>Not the &s;lighte&s;t hint to Sir Edward of the cau&s;e of my &s;udden vi&s;it to England. I might have &s;pared the caution. I know I may depend on your prudence.</P>

<P>AN unexpected incident occa&s;ions me to revoke the power I have placed in the hands of my dear uncle and aunt; a power, which not my duty and gratitude only, but my ju&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their very &s;uperior under&s;tandings induced me to give them. I &s;ay give; for I can never think that parents &s;hould have an affirmative voice in the&s;e matters; a negative one they have an in|conte&s;tible right to; and even of <HI>that</HI> they &s;ometimes make but too cruel a u&s;e. I owe more to you than I could to a father and mother. They would have a natural obli|gation, and a natural de&s;ire to &s;upport, to love me, and to &s;eek my welfare: all the&s;e you do, not nece&s;&s;arily, but freely and vo|luntarily; which, beyond doubt, very much enlarges my &s;phere of duty: yet, I frankly own, I could allow you no more than a ne|gative &mdash;and I well know you are both too generous to claim even <HI>that</HI>&mdash;in an affair of
<PB N="37" REF="39">&s;uch momentous concern to the future hap|pine&s;s of my life.</P>
<P>Where has my rambling pen led me? I was going to tell you, that an unexpected in|cident had fixed my intentions in re&s;pect to the marquis. It is, without further pre|face, as follows:&mdash;I have, &s;ince I came here, contracted a friend&s;hip with a Mi&s;s Marchmont, which I believe I might have mentioned to you in &s;ome of my former let|ters. Till within the pa&s;t month, I had every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this amiable girl amply returned the very lively tenderne&s;s I entertained for her; but during that period, there was an unu&s;ual coldne&s;s and con&s;traint in her behaviour to me. I could not think &s;he was of a fickle di&s;po&s;ition, and was po&s;itive I had given her no cau&s;e of di&s;plea|&s;ure, &s;o attributed the alteration rather to a melancholy &s;he wi&s;hed to conceal, than to any diminution of affection to me. From being the livelie&s;t creature imaginable, &s;he became quite the rever&s;e. Convinced that &s;uch a change was the effect of &s;ome extra|ordinary misfortune, I was exceedingly alarmed for her. I &s;ought to know the oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="38" REF="40">of her &s;orrow; not from an imperti|nent curio&s;ity, but the better to enable me to pour the &s;oothing balm of con&s;olation on her wounded mind. She avoided my en|quiry, which &s;eemed to give her &s;o much pain, that I extremely condemned my&s;elf for making it, though con&s;cious of the ju&s;|tifiablene&s;s of my intention. I think there are very few &s;ecrets that can ju&s;tly be denied to perfect friend&s;hip; but &s;ome there cer|tainly may be; and I doubted not Mi&s;s March|mont had proper rea&s;ons for her &s;ilence: I therefore was not offended, though cha|grined at her re&s;erve. It was her advan|tage, not my own gratification, I &s;ought; and &s;he be&s;t knew whether it was in my power to be &s;erviceable to her or not. As far as my friends plea&s;e to tru&s;t me, they &s;hall find me faithful; but I have no notion of over-earne&s;tly &s;oliciting a per&s;on's confidence, as it always has more the appearance of de&s;ign or curio&s;ity, than of affection. With the&s;e &s;entiments, you may imagine, I was no encroacher on the tenderne&s;s of my friend. Since &s;he would not put it in my power to comfort, or to advi&s;e, I endea|voured
<PB N="39" REF="41">to amu&s;e her, but was not &s;o happy as to &s;ucceed. Still was the dear girl me|lancholy, and &s;ometimes a little captious, and out of humour. I &s;eemed not to per|ceive it: they have an ill temper that can|not bear with the infirmities of tho&s;e they love.</P>
<P>Things continued in this train for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>About a week ago &s;he came to &s;pend a morning at Lady Enmore's. During her &s;tay, one of the footmen brought a letter to her lady&s;hip. As there was no company but Mi&s;s Marchmont, with whom we are on &s;o intimate a footing, &s;he made &s;ome apology, and opened it.</P>
<P>"Who is that from, madam?" a&s;ked lady Mary; who has a rea&s;onable portion of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"From the marquis de St. Clair."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Marchmont turned <HI>paler;</HI> for &s;he has &s;ome natural complexion, in &s;pite of the vile <HI>rouge.</HI> A &s;melling bottle of mine, which I had &s;hewn her for its remarkable beauty, fell from her hand, and was broken to pieces. I rallied her for being &s;o much
<PB N="40" REF="42">di&s;compo&s;ed at &s;uch a tri&s;ling accident. She in&s;tantly laid hold of this pretence, as I had de&s;igned &s;he &s;hould; apologized for the little mi&s;chief &s;he had done me; and ob|&s;erved that her nerves were &s;o weak, that the &s;udden breaking of any thing always threw her into di&s;order.</P>
<P>"Well, my dear," &s;aid I, <Q>mu&s;ic will &s;et you to rights in a moment. Lady Mary, will you favour us with a &s;ong?</Q></P>
<P>She immediately complied, which gave my fair friend time to recover her&s;elf; and &s;o the matter pa&s;&s;ed off: but I frequently afterwards revolved it in my mind with great perplexity. That &s;he loved the mar|quis, was the only probable &s;olution of the my&s;tery: if &s;o, I wondered I had not ob|&s;erved it &s;ooner. But I recollected I had &s;eldom &s;een them together; and as it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed her behaviour was carefully guarded at &s;uch times, it is not &s;urprizing it deceived one wholly un&s;u&s;picious. If &s;he had placed her affections on a man &s;he knew to have attached him&s;elf to another, her deep melancholy was no longer unac|countable. I called to mind &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="41" REF="43">which appeared to favour this opinion, particularly her referve to me;&mdash; what could be more natural; who would make a rival a confidante? Pride forbade it, and even genero&s;ity; &s;ince if I loved St. Clair&mdash;and her own pa&s;&s;ion would incline her to imagine I did&mdash;&s;he reduced me to the terrible nece&s;&s;ity of either acting an un|feeling and unfriendly part by her, or of making my&s;elf wretched. I flatter my&s;elf I need not tell you which &s;ide, even in that ca&s;e, I would have taken.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t break off here, as my lovely coun|trywoman, lady Lucy Domville, has ju&s;t called on me, to take a ramble with her. She is going to make &s;ome purcha&s;es, wherein &s;he politely wi&s;hes to profit by my fancy.</P>

<P>I SHALL now, my dear madam, re|&s;ume the &s;ubject of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>It highly concerned me to find out Mi&s;s Marchmont's &s;entiments: but how was I to penetrate them? It required an infinity of addre&s;s to que&s;tion her on &s;o nice a &s;ubject: I was apprehen&s;ive of hurting her delicacy, her pride; of appearing ungenerous; in &s;hort, I never was &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed in my life.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, it was fortunate for me that the marquis was out of town. This leads me to mention the purport of his let|ter to lady Enmore. It was, to inform her, &mdash;or rather me, through her&mdash;that he was confined to the country (where he had not intended to &s;tay above four days, at the mo&s;t) by his attendance on the chevalier d'Aumont, his particular friend, who had been de&s;perately wounded in a duel. You will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e this was accompanied by
<PB N="43" REF="45">a number of complaints, compliments, &amp;c. Three days after this letter had annihilated my poor &s;melling bottle, lady Mary told me, that Mi&s;s Marchmont had been en|quiring from her, whether I was to be mar|ried to St. Clair. "I declare," &s;aid her lady&s;hip, <Q>I believe &s;he has a penchant for him her&s;elf; &s;he looked &s;o confu&s;ed while &s;he &s;poke of him: and don't you remem|ber her di&s;order the other day, when my mother received his letter?</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am a&s;toni&s;hed a per&s;on of your lady|&s;hip's di&s;cernment, could harbour &s;o ri|diculous a &s;uppo&s;ition: the place I have the honour to hold in Mi&s;s Marchmont's friend&s;hip, &s;ufficiently confutes your er|ror.</Q></P>
<P>The word <HI>error</HI> offended her; and it was unpolite, or rather, it was incon&s;iderate in me to u&s;e it: &s;he repeated it twice with em|pha&s;is; then added, <Q>'Tis true, I am not ble&s;&s;ed with the penetration and profound judgment of Mi&s;s O'Bryen!</Q> pronounc|ing my name with a &s;neer, and to&s;&s;ing her little conceited head.

<P>As my talents for wrangling are by no means a match for her's, I thought it mo&s;t prudent not to an&s;wer a &s;peech that might have produced a quarrel.</P>
<P>"If you plea&s;e, lady Mary," &s;aid I, <Q>we &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject; but fir&s;t, let me conjure you never to divulge your very unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, as you may there|by greatly injure my Leonora.</Q></P>
<P>I was heartily &s;orry the malicious creature had made this di&s;covery, though it con|firmed my own &s;urmi&s;e. I was now deter|mined to come to an eclairci&s;&s;ement imme|diately, e&s;pecially as I found Mi&s;s March|mont intended to go to England with the Domvilles. I did not get an opportunity of conver&s;ing with her in private, till the day before ye&s;terday. Thus it was:&mdash;I
<PB N="45" REF="47">called at the <HI>hotel de Villemar,</HI> in the morn|ing. Madame de Villemar, her aunt, told me &s;he was in her own apartment, and was going to &s;end for her. I &s;aved her the trouble, by &s;tepping up &s;tairs my&s;elf. I found her weeping: &s;he &s;tarted, on &s;eeing me.</P>
<P>"Why the&s;e tears, my dear Leonora?" a&s;ked I, a&s;&s;ectionately taking her hand.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," an&s;wered &s;he, averting her face, <Q>I am a little low-&s;pirited this morning.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! Mi&s;s Marchmont, it is not parti|cularly this morning you are low-&s;pirited; you are always &s;o: yet, mi&s;er as you are, you hoard all your griefs within your own brea&s;t, and refu&s;e to &s;hare them with your friend.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No more, Mi&s;s O'Bryen; for pity's &s;ake importune me not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I mu&s;t, I mu&s;t, my Leonora. Ah! wherefore do you mock me with the name of friend, while you treat me with a re&s;erve incompatible with friend&s;hip?</Q></P>
<P>I waited her reply. She &s;poke not: &s;he &s;eemed greatly agitated. I endeavoured to
<PB N="46" REF="48">put an end to her di&s;tre&s;s as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. &mdash;<Q>Permit me, Mi&s;s Marchmont, to a&s;k you one que&s;tion: a que&s;tion which I in|treat and conjure you to an&s;wer with &s;in|cerity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>What que&s;tion?&mdash;what would you a&s;k?</Q> &s;he demanded, with fearful ha&s;ti|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Am I," &s;aid I, ba&s;hfully looking down, <Q>am I &s;o unfortunate as to be, di|rectly or indirectly, the cau&s;e of your&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>"In&s;ulter!" interrupted &s;he, colouring with re&s;entment; and &s;tarting from her &s;eat, &s;he moved towards the door with quickne&s;s: by a &s;till quicker movement I got between her and it.</P>
<P>"Call me not in&s;ulting!" and I threw my arms about her. <Q>Heaven be my witne&s;s, I intended not to in&s;ult; &s;till le&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, to grieve you. Will not you pardon me, Leonora?</Q> Ap|prehen&s;ive that the compa&s;&s;ion which was written on my heart, might be legible on my countenance, I reclined my face on her &s;houlder&mdash;unwilling to offend her, even by a look. She bur&s;t into tears, and be&s;ought
<PB N="47" REF="49">me to forgive her. Then recollecting her|&s;elf, as it were, &s;he half pu&s;hed me from her, exclaiming, <Q>Too charming crea|ture! Fatal beauty!&mdash;Would I had never known you!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! form not &s;o cruel a wi&s;h. If I have been your rival, 'twas ignorantly and unde&s;ignedly. I never cea&s;ed to be your friend, nor ever &s;hall. No longer view me in the former odious light; con|de&s;cend to accept me in the latter. Can you dive&s;t your&s;elf of&mdash;what you will al|low me to call&mdash;a narrow pride, and place your con&s;idence in one incapable of abu&s;ing it?

<P>"O, noble-minded Valeria!" cried &s;he; <Q>how little do I merit this genero&s;ity! Ca&s;t me for ever from a heart too wor|thy to entertain an affection for &s;uch an ingrate! I have hated&mdash;I have envied you&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">
"Do not condemn your&s;elf," an&s;wered I, <Q>for the natural effects of the mo&s;t un|controulable of all pa&s;&s;ions.

Endeavour to love me for the future, as &s;incerely as I &s;hall endeavour to de&s;erve it; and let us mutually forget the injuries we have involuntarily done each other.

<P>The &s;weet girl was quite oppre&s;&s;ed by her too lively gratitude. She wept&mdash;&s;he was unable to &s;peak. To relieve her, and perhaps in &s;ome mea&s;ure to relieve my&s;elf, for I was exceedingly affected, I abruptly feigned an engagement; and, tenderly em|bracing, quitted her.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now conclude pretty briefly, hav|ing already given my pen a greater portion of my time than I can well afford. When
<PB N="49" REF="51">I tell you that I leave Paris three days hence, you will imagine I mu&s;t be extreme|ly hurried.</P>
<P>I have &s;aved my&s;elf the fatigue of fare|well vi&s;its, by not mentioning my intention to any one, except Mon&s;ieur and Madame de Villemar, Mi&s;s Marchmont, lady En|more, and lady Mary; and Mr. Domville and his lady, whom I am to accompany.</P>
<P>Lady Enmore is to make my apologies to my acquaintance. That the &s;uddenne&s;s of my departure may not be thought my&s;|terious, &s;he thinks fit it &s;hould appear in con&s;equence of &s;ome letters from Ireland.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip has &s;aid every thing in her power to di&s;&s;uade me from going; and I really had occa&s;ion for all the little addre&s;s I am mi&s;tre&s;s of, to keep her from being of|fended. I could not tell her the true mo|tive that actuated me in this &s;udden re&s;olve. I was obliged to pretend that my impa|tience to &s;ee my Iri&s;h friends would not permit me to &s;tay another winter; and &s;he had no de&s;ign to return &s;ooner. I &s;hould have been happy, I &s;aid, to &s;tay with her three or four months longer, only the op|portunity
<PB N="50" REF="52">of going with the Domvilles was &s;o peculiarly tempting. All my rhetoric could hardly reconcile her to parting with me. She is a mo&s;t &s;incere and affectionate friend. I do not quit her without regret; and &s;hall never forget what I owe her.</P>
<P>Lady Mary is immea&s;urably afflicted at lo&s;ing &s;o agreeable a companion. <HI>Pa&s;&s;e pour cela!</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, that Mi&s;s Marchmont does not go to Eng|land. Her uncle and aunt, who are exce&s;|&s;ively fond of her, are delighted at her changing her mind, though they do not know why &s;he did &s;o.</P>
<P>She has engaged me to vi&s;it a &s;i&s;ter of her's of whom &s;he has given me an intere&s;ting hi&s;tory, which I &s;hall communicate to you when I have more lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I do not expect to &s;ee the marquis before I go, as the chevalier d'Aumont is con&s;ider|ably wor&s;e. Poor St. Clair! I grieve to think what his gentle nature may &s;uffer on my account. I &s;incerely hope his pa&s;&s;ion will expire, when he no longer beholds its object. I have de&s;ired Leonora to a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="51" REF="53">him of my gratitude and unalterable e&s;teem; but at the &s;ame time to tell him, that was all he had ever to expect from me.

<P>DAME Prudence took me by the hand, and led me here to look after my e&s;tate. I never &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had any thing further in view: but mark her treachery. Who could have &s;u&s;pected it in &s;uch a grave gen|tlewoman? She had mo&s;t devili&s;hly con|trived and complotted with the gods Hymen and Cupid, to introduce me to the acquaint|ance of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by. A merchant's daughter!&mdash;'tis true;&mdash;but what of that? &mdash;She has forty thou&s;and pounds!</P>
<P>Shall I tell you all how and about it?&mdash; I will.</P>
<P>Mr. Matthias Orm&s;by&mdash;it is nece&s;&s;ary, for the exactitude of the thing, that you &s;hould be told his chri&s;tian name&mdash;Mr. Matthias Orm&s;by, a London merchant, has two fair daughters, videlicet, Emily and Hannah: the former, it plea&s;ed Sir James Conway to take unto him, in quality of wife; leaving the latter for me, his friend,
<PB N="53" REF="55">and brother baronet. <Q>Very kind, and con&s;iderate,</Q> you will &s;ay, <Q>that he did not take both.</Q> Why &s;o it was; and to make my acknowledgments, I po&s;ted to his man&s;ion-hou&s;e, which is but three miles from my own, the &s;econd day after I came down&mdash;was mo&s;t ho&s;pitably received by Sir James&mdash;introduced to his bride, and her &s;i&s;ter&mdash;reque&s;ted to accept a general invita|tion, of which I have frequently availed my&s;elf; my hou&s;e being then, as at pre|&s;ent, utterly de&s;titute of inhabitants, &s;ave only &s;elf and &s;ervants and I am entirely of opinion, that <Q>it is not good for man to be alone.</Q></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my vi&s;its, Sir James has &s;ometimes dropt hints, that I &s;hould do well to countenance his example, and clear my e&s;tate.</P>
<P>What does your lord&s;hip think of this advice? My e&s;tate, you know, is worth about ten thou&s;and a year. My father in|volved it extremely. I have been clearing ever &s;ince I came to it; and have now re|duced the debts to thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and
<PB N="54" REF="56">pounds. By living within the bounds I have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf, I &s;hall pay off the whole in le&s;s than ten years. But &s;up|po&s;e I take a more expeditious method.&mdash; Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's fortune will more than &s;ettle my affairs; and her father will likewi&s;e leave her a con&s;iderable &s;um at his death. I a&s;&s;ure you, the oeconomy of this &s;cheme has &s;truck me forcibly.</P>
<P>May I boa&s;t to you, that Mi&s;s Orm&s;by treats me with di&s;tinction. If &s;he did not, perhaps I &s;hould not think of her. The dear charmer &s;hould con&s;ider, however, that&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"A heart by kindne&s;s only gain'd,</L>
<L>"Will a dear conque&s;t prove;</L>
<L>"And, to be kept, mu&s;t be maintain'd</L>
<L>"At va&s;t expence of love."</L></Q>
<P>Call it vanity, or gratitude, which you will, Methuen; but a&s;&s;uredly there is &s;ome|thing irre&s;i&s;tibly engaging in being beloved. When a woman &s;eems ready to jump into one's arms, indeed, 'tis quite another mat|ter. I admire her, who</P>
<Q><PB N="55" REF="57">
<L>"&mdash;In &s;triving to hide,</L>
<L>"&mdash;Reveals all her flame."</L></Q>
<P>This is exactly Hannah's ca&s;e. She fixes her mild eyes, filled with dying langour, on my face; in&s;tantly draws them off, with great confu&s;ion, when their glances meet mine. She practi&s;es a number of other pretty contrivances; &s;o natural to her wily &s;ex, when they would en&s;nare our hearts.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s you expect a de&s;cription of my fair one:&mdash;here it follows then.</P>
<P>She is tall, &s;lender, and &s;traight. But to &s;hew you my impartiality&mdash;a rare virtue in a lover!&mdash;I mu&s;t confe&s;s, her limbs are ra|ther coar&s;e, than delicate; &s;tiff, than ela&s;tic; but, on the whole, &s;he has &s;omething very genteel and <HI>degag&eacute;e</HI> in her appearance.&mdash; Now for her face&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"O, face, indu&s;triou&s;ly contriv'd by Heaven,</L>
<L>"To fix my eyes, and captivate my &s;oul!"</L></Q>
<P>Shall I di&s;&s;ect her features? Perchance they will not bear it; though they do very well together, let me tell you. Her fore|head,
<PB N="56" REF="58">cheeks, no&s;e, and chin, are unexcep|tionable. O, mo&s;t unlover-like, thus ne|gatively to prai&s;e them in the aggregate! I &s;hould have &s;eparated them, and be&s;towed a poetical &s;imile or two on each. Well, to make amends for my negligence&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"Her radiant eyes,</L>
<L>"The bright, cele&s;tial blue that paints the &s;kies."</L></Q>
<P>By the way, I have no pa&s;&s;ion for blue eyes: they are generally &s;oft, &s;ometimes bright, but almo&s;t always want life.</P>
<P>Her mouth is rather wide; but her teeth are white, and even. Her hair is a pretty light-brown, very thick and glo&s;&s;y: her &s;kin, white as the new-blown lily; but her complexion not blooming enough for my ta&s;te. There is a &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility in her looks, with a tincture of indolence.</P>
<P>Her under&s;tanding is good enough for her &s;ex; but &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not a &s;ingle &s;park of what we call wit. I cannot &s;ay I lament that, as I think wit a mo&s;t unamiable and dangerous quality, when it is not joined to
<PB N="57" REF="59">an uncommon &s;trength of judgment, and goodne&s;s of heart.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MARCHMONT, I tell you frankly, I do not approve your precipitate choice. 'Tis a prudent one with regard to fortune; but as to birth, I could wi&s;h you had been a little more nice. I have been making en|quiries about Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's family. Her father, I find, has the character of a wor|thy, hone&s;t, rich man; but he may have dropt from "the heavens above," or&mdash; more applicable, indeed&mdash;a&s;cended from "the earth beneath," for any thing I know to the contrary; for, in &s;pite of my &s;tricte&s;t re&s;earches, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly learn he had a &s;ingle forefather. Mrs. Orm&s;by's family, it &s;eems, is tolerably genteel.</P>
<P>Had I no knowledge of your di&s;po&s;ition, except what your letter conveyed to me, I &s;hould certainly conclude you were one of the greate&s;t mi&s;ers on earth; and &s;o impute your&mdash;I believe I mi&s;apply the word&mdash;<HI>pa&s;|&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="61">for this girl, wholly to avaricious mo|tives: but I well know you are greatly above &s;uch meanne&s;s. Your e&s;tate is in|cumbred; yet it &s;urely is a competence; nay, much more than a competence: and he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing enough, &s;ighs for more, is a de&s;picable fellow! The votaries of Plutus are more wretched, and far more contemptible, than tho&s;e of any other god in the whole Pagan theology.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another con&s;ideration&mdash;of which I apprehend you have not been &s;uffi|ciently mindful&mdash;of more weight than either high de&s;cent or riches; I mean the intere&s;ts of the heart. You call your&s;elf a lover; yet there is not a &s;entence throughout your letter, that appears to me to &s;avour of a pa&s;&s;ion, of which I am bold enough to think my&s;elf an excellent judge. You will allow me, likewi&s;e, to know &s;omething of ma|trimony, as I have been almo&s;t four years a hu&s;band; and believe me, Marchmont, that love&mdash;love alone can make that &s;tate de&s;ireable. You have often laughed at what you call my romantic notions: but I &s;till maintain them, and &s;hall to the end of
<PB N="60" REF="62">my days, in defiance of all your lively rail|lery. I know you have the many on your &s;ide. I care not: I am by no means a&s;hamed of being &s;ingularly in the right. What! becau&s;e mo&s;t minds are too dull, or too coar&s;e, to feel the lively and delicate &s;en&s;ations, that warm and purify my heart; mu&s;t I, therefore, give up an opinion, found|ed, not on imagination, but experience; and joining mine to the vulgar voice, call love romantic; its joys evane&s;cent and delu&s;ive? No, I neither can nor will, conceal from my&s;elf or others, that I am &s;upremely hap|py; and that it is love which makes me &s;o.</P>
<P>If I thought you one of tho&s;e grovelling wretches, into who&s;e narrow &s;ouls love can|not force an entrance, I &s;hould not have touched on this &s;ubject; but I am convinced your generous, enlarged mind, is capable of entertaining this pa&s;&s;ion in its utmo&s;t &s;ublimity; and that the in&s;en&s;ibility you have pre&s;erved to your twenty-fourth year, is wholly accidental: or, perhaps, in a great mea&s;ure owing to the quickne&s;s of your penetration, which enables you &s;o ea&s;ily to develope the in&s;ignificance, which,
<PB N="61" REF="63">I acknowledge, does but too much abound in the female character.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, you tell me, has &s;en&s;e enough for her <HI>&s;ex;</HI> you &s;hould rather have &s;aid, for her <HI>education:</HI> for certainly, Sir Edward, it is fal&s;e and illiberal to &s;uppo&s;e the natural capacities of women, much&mdash;if at all&mdash;inferior to our own. Undeniably there are numbers of them very triflers. But may not the &s;ame be &s;aid of the men? And how many ladies do we &s;ee, overcom|ing all the di&s;advantages they have to con|tend with, make a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in conver&s;ation? Let me a&s;k you&mdash;I know you will &s;mile at the que&s;tion&mdash;Did you ever hear lady Methuen make an ob&s;erva|tion you would have blu&s;hed to pronounce?</P>
<P>I am running into a greater length than I intended when I began this letter. I de|&s;igned only to put you upon con&s;idering, whether the per&s;onal attractions of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by will make her an agreeable com|panion for life? You don't &s;eem to be in very violent raptures with them, even at pre&s;ent: and I caution you not to &s;uppo&s;e that your inclination will be la&s;ting, becau&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="64">it is moderate;&mdash;it is in its own nature pe|ri&s;hable. An attachment founded entirely on out&s;ide beauty, can never hold a man of &s;en&s;e&mdash;nor, perhaps, any man&mdash;for an length of time.</P>
<P>I am confident you have no &s;entiments for Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, that pity does not in&s;pire. You &s;ee her unhappy;&mdash;know your&s;elf the cau&s;e, and wi&s;h to relieve her. Is not this the whole matter; though your &s;crupu|lous genero&s;ity did not allow you to &s;peak thus plainly?</P>
<P>It is generally thought arrogant to return pity for love. I cannot conceive why? It is brutal not to feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; dou|bly &s;o, when we our&s;elves are&mdash;though ever &s;o innocently&mdash;the cau&s;e of their unea&s;ine&s;s: therefore I think it impo&s;&s;ible, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to dive&s;t one's &s;elf of compa&s;&s;ion; and both unnece&s;&s;ary and inexpedient to conceal it. I would not have a gentleman, or even a lady, &s;ay&mdash;<HI>I pity you;</HI>&mdash;but I think they may&mdash;nay, ought&mdash;to expre&s;s pity by their looks, &s;oftened voice, perhaps tears, and indirectly by their words: a man, certainly, with rather more circum&s;pection than need
<PB N="63" REF="65">be ob&s;erved by a woman. Compa&s;&s;ion, when delicately &s;hewn, is far from being offen&s;ive; it is grateful.</P>
<P>I hope what I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject, will be &s;ufficient to induce you to treat me, in this affair, with the &s;ame unre&s;erve you do in all others: though, certainly, to any other than a long-tried, faithful friend,&mdash;in which light I dare to think you regard me&mdash; it would be di&s;honourable in you to com|municate your &s;entiments for Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, becau&s;e it would be expo&s;ing her to cen&s;ure; cu&s;tom having&mdash;I believe, very rightly&mdash; made it improper for the fair &s;ex to love fir&s;t. They &s;hould&mdash;</P>
<Q>"&mdash;Be woo'd; and not un&s;ought be won."</Q>
<P>Whether you think fit to tru&s;t me or not with the &s;ituation of your heart, I conjure you be careful not to hide it from your&s;elf. Be a&s;&s;ured it is not &s;ufficient for you merely to give this young lady a preference to others: it is requi&s;ite you &s;hould love her. A preference in a di&s;engaged heart, is not of much con&s;equence; if circum&s;tances fa|vour,
<PB N="64" REF="66">it may <HI>probably</HI> improve into pa&s;&s;ion; but it is not at all <HI>certain</HI> that it will do &s;o.

The whole force of your arguments turns on this &s;ingle point,&mdash;I don't love Hannah Orm&s;by: the con&s;equence of which is, I may hereafter love &s;omebody el&s;e. I certainly have not that &s;ort of &s;entiment for her, to which, alone, your romantic imagination would affix the name of love: but I e&s;teem, and&mdash;you have reconciled me to the acknowledgment &mdash;I pity her. The &s;weet girl is unhappy; it is in my power to make her otherwi&s;e;&mdash; and &s;hall I not? Methuen, I &s;hould de|&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, were I capable of he&s;itating between the <HI>prudent</HI> and the <HI>generous.</HI> Yes, I will &s;acrifice my long-pre&s;erved liberty to her peace. Neither do I apprehend any danger from this conduct. I am confident I never &s;hall be in love, according to your eccentric notions of that pa&s;&s;ion. I doubt not, Hannah will always be able to main|tain the preference I already give her. In|deed, were I to meet a woman equally
<PB N="67" REF="69">amiable, who joined a very &s;uperior under|&s;tanding to a form more attractively lovely, &mdash;I know not that I could an&s;wer for my heart. But I have not the lea&s;t expectation of ever &s;eeing &s;uch a per&s;on. Nine-tenths of the young and hand&s;ome part of the &s;ex &mdash;and, po&s;itively, my wife mu&s;t be young and hand&s;ome&mdash;are intolerably affected, im|pertinent, and in&s;ignificant. By the way, it is of little con&s;equence whether it be na|ture or education that makes them &s;o: it is &s;ufficient for me to know that the thing is certain; and certain it is, even by your own confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To be very &s;erious:&mdash;It is too late for you to argue again&s;t my choice:&mdash;it is made. 'Tis true, I have not yet declared my&s;elf; but I have &s;aid more than I would un-&s;ay for worlds. Could I recede from what I had even <HI>looked,</HI> I &s;hould hold my&s;elf unworthy to be Lord Methuen's friend.</P>
<P>I have not written to my &s;i&s;ter Went|worth on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I expect to &s;ee her in a few days. I &s;hall be mi&s;erable

<P>AS your la&s;t gives me an account of your arrival at lord Linfield's, I &s;et about an|&s;wering all your dear letters. To begin with the one that de&s;ires us to direct your conduct to the marquis: you cannot ima|gine how much it embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed us. There is no denying it,&mdash;it would have half broken our hearts, had you &s;ettled in France; but we did not dare to give you the lea&s;t hint of &s;uch a nature; well know|ing you would, in that ca&s;e, refu&s;e St. Clair, were he ever &s;o dear to you. Could we have been certain you had no <HI>tendre&s;&s;e</HI> for him, we &s;hould not have had any &s;cruple about the matter: his rank and fortune would not have bia&s;&s;ed us, for we were far from fearing with lady Enmore, that <Q>you might never have &s;uch another offer.</Q> Our &s;ole difficulty aro&s;e from the apprehen|&s;ion of your loving him. Your uncle, in|deed, was inclined to think the marquis in|debted
<PB N="70" REF="72">for your confe&s;&s;ed predilection, only to his &s;uperiority over your other admirers, and to his &s;oftne&s;s, which excited your's. He thought your letter to him &s;upported this opinion. "Do you imagine," he would &s;ay to me, <Q>that a girl in love could write on &s;uch &s;ubjects as the&s;e, with &s;o much judgment and accuracy?</Q> He ac|knowledged, however, that he apprehended the little Frenchman in a fair way of gain|ing your affections. But, for my part, when I con&s;idered that he obviou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed a larger portion of my dear, &s;aucy girl's favour, than any other gentleman has been fortunate enough to obtain, I could not help fearing he had already conquered a heart, which has braved &s;o many attacks. In this per&s;ua&s;ion I wrote to you. I beg|ged you to examine your heart, and chu&s;e whatever was mo&s;t con&s;onant to its wi&s;hes, without a thought of us, who could not but approve of every thing you did, and mu&s;t be happy in your happine&s;s. This letter, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have not re|ceived, as you do not mention it.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">
You will perhaps be &s;urprized, that I once wrote to you about this gentleman in rather a favourable manner. The propo&s;al was repre&s;ented to me to be &s;o advanta|geous, that I was afraid I &s;hould be want|ing to your intere&s;t, if I did not &s;eem to approve it. I at fir&s;t &s;lattered my&s;elf I &s;hould be able to ma&s;ter my &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; but the more I reflected on the &s;ubject, the more in&s;upportable became the thought of lo&s;ing your &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure we received from your two next letters, amply compen&s;ated the anxiety conveyed to us by the preceding. Valeria has acted like <HI>her&s;elf!</HI> This &s;entence only, which comprehends every thing noble, can &s;ufficiently expre&s;s our &s;entiments of your conduct to Mi&s;s Marchmont.</P>
<P>We are charmed with the hope of &s;oon &s;eeing you. Lord Melmont &s;ays, he ex|pects his daughter and Mr. Domville will pay him a vi&s;it early in the &s;ummer. I fan|cy it would be agreeable to you to wait for them. Your friend, lady Lucy, will be delighted with your company: but if you would rather come to Ireland immediately,

<P>Why did my lovely Valeria &s;ay, in one of her letters, "<HI>If</HI> I am hand&s;ome." Do you really think I can &s;uppo&s;e you ignorant of your beauty? If you have either eyes or ears you mu&s;t know it; for you have never been debarred the u&s;e of looking-gla&s;&s;es, nor the conver&s;ation of the other &s;ex. No man&mdash; not even your uncle&mdash;ever addre&s;&s;ed you, but in a &s;tile that would have been ridicu|lous flattery to any other; you have &s;ub|dued more hearts than you have numbered years: how, then, is it po&s;&s;ible for you to doubt your being hand&s;ome? I know you are not vain; and, when you write to me, I in&s;i&s;t on your taking no pains to avoid the imputation of vanity. I wi&s;h to be made acquainted with every thing that concerns you, even to the conver&s;ations you are en|gaged in; and if you gratify my de&s;ire, &s;elf-prai&s;e is unavoidable. I a&s;pire to be treated with the &s;ame freedom you would u&s;e to a corre&s;pondent of your own age; nay, more, for friend&s;hip might not be able to exclude mi&s;con&s;truing envy from a

<P>I WRITE this from the &s;weete&s;t roman|tic &s;pot in England. But I mu&s;t go back a little, to tell you how I came here. The morning after I arrived in London, lord and lady Methuen&mdash;a mo&s;t amiable pair&mdash; paid a vi&s;it at lord Linfield's, purpo&s;ely to &s;ee Mi&s;s Marchmont, and conduct her to her &s;i&s;ter. They &s;eemed much di&s;appointed at not finding her; more, though, on Mrs. Wentworth's account than their own, not being at all acquainted with her. I told them, Mon&s;ieur and Madame de Villemar's extreme reluctance to part with their niece, had induced her to lay a&s;ide her intention of coming to England. I added, that I had a letter from her to Mrs. Wentworth, which I wi&s;hed for an opportunity of delivering into that lady's own hands; as I was ex|tremely de&s;irous of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t vi&s;it her then, madam;" &s;aid lady Methuen, <Q>for &s;he never leaves home.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
<Q>The retired, and melancholy Mrs. Wentworth,</Q> ob&s;erved lord Methuen, <Q>would be no de&s;irable companion to a lady in the full bloom of youth and beau|ty; and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great deal of vi|vacity &mdash;if I rightly read her animated face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When I have the honour to be better known to lord Methuen, I dare to think he will judge more favourably of me. I have not been wholly nur&s;ed in the lap of pro&s;perity; and I hope my heart is not naturally &s;o hard, but it could have felt for others, although it had never found occa&s;ion of feeling for it&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I did not, in the lea&s;t, mean to que&s;|tion the goodne&s;s of your heart, madam,</Q> &s;aid his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"If you had," returned his lady, <Q>I &s;hould have entertained a very poor opi|nion of your &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy. Now I pretend to be a perfect <HI>connoi&s;&s;eu&s;e</HI> in that &s;cience; and I am po&s;itive Mi&s;s O'Bryen's fine features expre&s;s as much good-nature as vivacity. I am &s;ure, my dear,</Q> added &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing me with an
<PB N="76" REF="78">agreeable familiarity, <Q>you will not have any objection to going with me to Mrs. Wentworth's to-morrow morning. Lord Methuen cannot accompany us, as he is engaged in town. My coach will hold us, and our women.</Q></P>
<P>I readily a&s;&s;ented to this propo&s;al; telling lady Linfield, that I hoped &s;he would not be offended with me, as &s;he &s;aw that, by a non-compliance, I &s;hould eternally forfeit my reputation for good-nature. She made &s;ome polite objections; but lady Methuen's earne&s;tne&s;s prevailed.</P>
<P>We accordingly &s;et out at eleven next day; and after a plea&s;ant little journey, of about &s;ixteen miles, arrived at Hermitage before two.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wentworth, knowing the equipage from the window, ran out; and, getting to the coach &s;ide ju&s;t as we were alighting, &s;he exclaimed, "My &s;i&s;ter is here!"</P>
<P>"Alas! my dear," &s;aid lady Methuen, taking her hand, <Q>&s;he is not here; but this young lady can give you &s;ome account of her.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79">
I felt exceedingly for her di&s;appointment; tears of pity filled my eyes;&mdash;they alarmed her.</P>
<P>"Ah!" cried &s;he, <Q>my poor Leonora is ill.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No; I a&s;&s;ure you, madam, &s;he is ex|tremely well; at lea&s;t &s;he was &s;o when I left Paris.</Q></P>
<P>When we got into the parlour, the love|ly widow &s;trenuou&s;ly embraced her friend; &s;aluted me; and, placing her&s;elf by me, earn|e&s;tly enquired for Mi&s;s Marchmont. I pre&s;ented her letter, &s;aying, I &s;hould think her very ceremonious if &s;he &s;crupled read|ing it before us.</P>
<P><Q>Perhaps, my dear Harriet, you would rather retire to read it; I am &s;ure Mi&s;s O'Bryen will excu&s;e you.</Q></P>
<P>"Mi&s;s O'Bryen!" echoing my name with much quickne&s;s and &s;urprize.</P>
<P>"I beg her pardon, and yours," &s;aid her lady&s;hip, <Q>for neglecting to introduce her to you; but, really, my concern for you put it out of my head.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You are on your way to Ireland, I &s;up|po&s;e, madam,</Q> &s;aid Mrs. Wentworth.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">
I replied, "Not immediately." I thought the que&s;tion extremely abrupt.</P>
<P>Pleading impatience to peru&s;e her letter, &s;he left the room: and lady Methuen, in a very polite manner, apologized to me for&mdash; what &s;he called&mdash;the whim&s;icalne&s;s of her behaviour.</P>
<P>In &s;ome little time &s;he returned;&mdash;her every feature enlivened by joy, and &s;oftened by &s;en&s;ibility. She flew towards me, and, cla&s;ping me in her arms, poured forth a thou&s;and prai&s;es and acknowledgments of&mdash; what &s;he termed&mdash;my genero&s;ity to her &s;i&s;|ter. She &s;poke incoherently, and in a &s;tile extravagantly beyond my de&s;erts.</P>
<P>Lady Methuen looked on in &s;ilence for &s;ome minutes, then begged Mrs. Went|worth to tell her the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tran&s;|ports. "But ju&s;t now," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>your behaviour to Mi&s;s O'Bryen was &s;o cold, as to border on incivility; at pre&s;ent, it is as unaccountably warm.</Q></P>
<P><Q>At fir&s;t, Loui&s;a, I regarded this charming lady as the de&s;troyer of a &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s. Read that letter, and &s;ee how unju&s;t I have been to her. Perhaps I ought not
<PB N="79" REF="81">to divulge Leonora's &s;ecrets; but I can hide nothing from you.</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>I return to fini&s;h my letter while the coach is getting ready. We are going to take an airing, and &s;hall probably meet Sir Edward Marchmont, Mrs. Wentworth's only bro|ther, whom &s;he expects here this morning. I am &s;orry he is coming to break in on our &s;weet female party. I cannot &s;ay I di&s;like either men or mirth; yet I never &s;pent two days more to my ta&s;te than the&s;e la&s;t pa&s;t, when both were entirely excluded. Lady Methuen's fine under&s;tanding makes her a mo&s;t agreeable companion. Mrs. Went|worth has a great deal of good &s;en&s;e; and there is a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy in every thing &s;he &s;ays, that is ineffably plea&s;|ing: &s;he has the mo&s;t in&s;inuating gentlene&s;s of manners; there dwells a "melancholy grace" about her, which touches the heart in a way not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe. Whenever I
<PB N="80" REF="82">look on this beautiful, unhappy woman, I call to mind tho&s;e lines.</P>
<Q><L>"As when a du&s;ky mi&s;t involves the &s;ky,</L>

<L>"O'er the dull face of nature; &s;o her charms</L>
<L>"Divinely graceful &s;hone upon her grief,</L>

<P>I am afraid &s;he is melancholy to exce&s;s, when alone; for her Loui&s;a's and my joint endeavours, can hardly keep her in tolera|ble &s;pirits for any length of time. Amiable unfortunate! how deeply do I feel your woes! Her hi&s;tory, which you may re|member I promi&s;ed you, will be conveyed to you by this po&s;t: I have inter&s;per&s;ed it with &s;ome account of her family.

<P>Lady Methuen &s;ays Sir Edward March|mont is a charming fellow, and bids me take care of my heart. I felt more for St.

<DIV2 TYPE="narrative">
<P>Mrs. Wentworth's father, Sir George Marchmont, was on a tour through France, when he became enamoured of Mademoi&s;elle de Villemar, a little, lively brunette, who had ju&s;t e&s;caped out of a convent, where &s;he had been brought up, having lo&s;t her mother in her infancy. Her father, who&s;e mind was bent on aggrandizing his family, had de&s;igned to make her take the veil,
<PB N="82" REF="84">that he might leave the larger fortune to his &s;on.</P>
<P>The gloom of a cloi&s;ter ill &s;uited the gay temper of Angelica: but in vain &s;he remon|&s;trated, &s;he wept in vain; <HI>Mon&s;ieur &s;on pere</HI> was inexorable. Her good genius did not abandon her in this extremity; but having made intere&s;t with the king of terrors, prevailed on his dread maje&s;ty to di&s;mi&s;s the old gentleman from all his em|ployments on this &s;ide eternity.</P>
<P>Her brother was too generous to u&s;e the advantage a father's unju&s;t pride had given him. He took her home, and promi&s;ed to give her a hand&s;ome fortune.</P>
<P>Her &s;ituation became now as agreeable, as it had before been the contrary. Mon|&s;ieur de Villemar was married to a lady who had pa&s;&s;ed two years in the &s;ame convent with her, and the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed by the count de Meulan, who&s;e addre&s;&s;es were highly approved of by her brother, and not ob|jected to by her. This nobleman bore a re&s;pectable character; and though pa&s;t the
<PB N="83" REF="85">bloom of life, might &s;till be thought hand|&s;ome. Angelica, however, had no liking to his per&s;on, but her little heart fluttered at the thought of being a counte&s;s.</P>
<P>While this match was on the <HI>tapis,</HI> &s;he happened to meet Sir George Marchmont in the Thuilleries: he walked with &s;ome gentlemen and ladies &s;he knew; by which means they became acquainted. It is not &s;urprizing that two very engaging young per&s;ons &s;hould draw each other's attention: <HI>pour abr&eacute;ger,</HI>&mdash;a few vi&s;its created a lively pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>He declared him&s;elf to her brother, who an&s;wered, Mademoi&s;elle was engaged. Sir George, in de&s;pair, threw him&s;elf at his mi&s;tre&s;s's feet. <HI>Le beau chevalier Anglois</HI> was not to be <HI>re&s;i&s;ted.</HI> She candidly ex|plained her &s;ituation; a&s;&s;ured him of her indifference to Meulan; and, with a mode&s;t frankne&s;s, confe&s;&s;ed her attachment to him. As &s;he knew her brother's high &s;en&s;e of ho|nour would never permit him to counte|nance her jilting the count, &s;he con&s;ented to marry Sir George privately, and after|wards fled with him to England.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">
When Mon&s;ieur de Villemar found his &s;i&s;ter was married, he rightly judged a pur|&s;uit would be improper. Though he did not endeavour to detain her, he was ex|tremely &s;hocked at her marrying a heretic. When &s;he for&s;ook the Roman catholic com|munion, his indignation was &s;o great, he re&s;olved never to &s;ee her more.</P>
<P>The affection of an amiable hu&s;band &s;he found &s;ufficient to con&s;ole her for the lo&s;s of every thing &s;he had &s;acrificed to him. They lived in an uninterrupted cour&s;e of happi|pine&s;s for twelve years, when lady March|mont died, leaving only three children out of &s;even;&mdash;Edward, who was then eleven years old; Harriet, nine; and Leonora, eight.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Villemar was more grieved at this event, than might have been ex|pected, from his antecedent behaviour; and having no children of his own, readily gave ear to his wife's propo&s;al of adopting one of his late &s;i&s;ter's. He wrote to Sir George, earne&s;tly begging him to repair the injury he had done him, in depriving him of his &s;i&s;ter, by giving him up one of
<PB N="85" REF="87">her daughters, whom he would look on as his own child, and leave her every thing he died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; &s;tipulating only, that &s;he &s;hould be entirely re&s;igned to his care; and that he mu&s;t be allowed to bring her up in the Roman catholic religion.</P>
<P>Sir George's notions of religion were ex|tremely liberal; he was likewi&s;e a good deal in debt; &s;o he chearfully accepted the offer, and di&s;patched the little Leonora to Paris; the dowager lady Marchmont having pro|mi&s;ed to provide for Harriet, who lived mo&s;tly with her.</P>
<P>While Sir George wholly devoted him|&s;elf to the education of his &s;on, his mother applied her&s;elf with no le&s;s diligence to that of his daughter. She looked on mu&s;ic, dancing, &amp;c. as the mere &s;uperficies of edu|cation. She made her young pupil read: &s;he taught her to think! She &s;hewed her to appretiate the ble&s;&s;ings of life ju&s;tly; and patiently to bear its misfortunes. Her chief care was to implant religion deeply in her mind; and not only religion, but honour: for, however in&s;ufficient a guide the latter may be without the former, it certainly is
<PB N="86" REF="88">an excellent auxiliary; it gives a &s;uperior noblene&s;s to our thoughts, and a brighter poli&s;h to our actions.</P>
<P>At eighteen, the lovely, all-accompli&s;hed Harriet Marchmont, became the wife of Mr. Wentworth. This gentleman came recommended by every advantage that birth, education, and fortune could add to the bounty of nature. Her friends approved, and &s;he adored him. But, alas! he had one ill quality, of which &s;he, unhappily, was ignorant,&mdash;a mo&s;t jealous temper, &s;trengthened by an unfavourable opinion of female virtue.</P>
<P>They lived in the mo&s;t perfect harmony almo&s;t a year: nor did &s;he in all that time di&s;cover his di&s;po&s;ition. Perhaps &s;he would never have done &s;o, had not her brother, who was ju&s;t then returned from Italy, brought home with him Mr. Methuen, elde&s;t &s;on to lord Methuen, who&s;e over|bearing, proud, and un&s;ocial temper, drove his children from his &s;ociety. Mr. Methuen was continually with Mr. Marchmont; either at Marchmont-hou&s;e, or Wentworth|place. Mr. Wentworth looked on his wife
<PB N="87" REF="89">as the cau&s;e. He narrowly watched her actions; but, in the true &s;pirit of jealou&s;y, was careful not to let her perceive he &s;u&s;|pected her, for fear of putting her on her guard.</P>
<P>The innocent Harriet &s;aw not the preci|pice on which &s;he &s;tood; &s;he took no pains to conceal her e&s;teem for her brother's friend: when pre&s;ent, &s;he treated him with di&s;tingui&s;hed civility; and in his ab&s;ence frequently gave him the prai&s;es his merit entitled him to.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, likewi&s;e, his behaviour to her, was but too well calculated to confirm her hu&s;band's &s;u&s;picions: to all women he was attentive and polite; but to Mrs. Went|worth, he was even a&s;&s;iduous; he admired her,&mdash;he loved her next to his Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Loui&s;a Sydney was the daughter of a clergyman, who had left her a very &s;mall fortune. It was madne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e the haughty lord Methuen would ever al|low his &s;on to make &s;uch an alliance. Mr. Methuen made both the young lady and her mother &s;en&s;ible, that it would be fruit|le&s;s to propo&s;e it to him; and without much
<PB N="88" REF="90">difficulty obtained their con&s;ent to a private union, to be kept &s;ecret during the old lord's life. His frequent vi&s;its began to be ob&s;erved: the world &s;et him down as Mi&s;s Sydney's lover; and, for once, the world &s;aid le&s;s than the truth, &s;ince he was already her hu&s;band. The report reached his fa|ther, who roundly told him, he mu&s;t either give up Mi&s;s Sydney's acquaintance, or his favour; and concluded with reminding him, that he had intended &s;ome time before to make another excur&s;ion to Italy, which he hoped he had not forgotten. This di&s;agree|able intelligence he quickly communicated to his Loui&s;a and her mother, who concur|red in advi&s;ing him to make the voyage his father propo&s;ed. He &s;taid but a &s;hort time abroad, being unable to &s;upport the ab&s;ence of his beloved wife; though, after his re|turn, he dared to make her but &s;hort vi&s;its, and tho&s;e &s;eldom, and private.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, he found great con&s;olation in complaining to the gen|tle, compa&s;&s;ionating Harriet, whom he made unre&s;ervedly his confidante. He &s;ought opportunities of conver&s;ing with her alone,
<PB N="89" REF="91">that he might talk of his Loui&s;a. Con&s;ci|ous of the honourable nature of his friend&s;hip for her, he thought not of concealing it from her hu&s;band, or any other. No won|der, then, if the magnifying eye of jea|lou&s;y &s;aw enough to condemn them.</P>
<P>She began, at length, to perceive a con|&s;iderable abatement in Mr. Wentworth's af|fection. In vain &s;he &s;ought the cau&s;e for it in her own blamele&s;s conduct: &s;he was obliged to &s;olve it into incon&s;tancy. She would not upbraid him: &s;he endeavoured to hide her &s;u&s;picions; but &s;he could not hide the grief they occa&s;ioned her; he per|ceived it, and Methuen being in London, placed it to the account of his ab&s;ence. He a&s;ked her, with a kind of &s;neer, why &s;he was low-&s;pirited? Unu&s;ed to &s;peak any thing but pure truth, &s;he he&s;itated, and ap|peared confu&s;ed, while &s;he attributed it to a head-ach.</P>
<P><Q>O, you want company, child; you will be better next week: Mr. Methuen's conver&s;ation&mdash;</Q>. He &s;topped &s;ud|denly, as recollecting him&s;elf, but the quick|ne&s;s wherewith he had &s;poken,&mdash;the tone
<PB N="90" REF="92">and look of angry irony,&mdash;the emphatical pronunciation of the name of Methuen,&mdash; at once opened her eyes. She was all amazement; and, unable to &s;peak a word in her own ju&s;tification, &s;at &s;ilent; con|fu&s;edly revolving in her mind every circum|&s;tance of her conduct to Methuen, and his to her, which could po&s;&s;ibly give ri&s;e to her hu&s;band's di&s;plea&s;ure. Her &s;ilence, and very apparent di&s;order, had but too much the air of guilt; and, doubtle&s;s, was &s;o con&s;trued by the &s;elf-tormenting Went|worth.</P>
<P>At this very in&s;tant a &s;ervant came in, and delivered a letter to his lady. The &s;u|per&s;cription was a man's hand, and like her brother's; who being the only gentleman &s;he corre&s;ponded with, &s;he imagined the letter was from him, and very naturally &s;aid aloud, as &s;he opened it, "From Edward." Her cheek burned when &s;he found it was from Methuen.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this fatal letter was as &s;light, as its con&s;equences were important. Mi&s;s Marchmont had written to her &s;i&s;ter to &s;end her &s;ome Engli&s;h books. Mr.
<PB N="91" REF="93">Methuen having a friend going to Paris, promi&s;ed to get him to take them to her; and Mrs. Wentworth commi&s;&s;ioned him, when he went to London, to buy them: he had lo&s;t the li&s;t &s;he gave him, and wrote to her for another.</P>
<P>Though this was his &s;ole motive for writing, he had not entirely confined him&s;elf to this &s;ubject: he could not help mentioning his Loui&s;a, who was always uppermo&s;t in his thoughts.</P>
<P>Had &s;he been at liberty to &s;hew this let|ter, it would have effectually de&s;troyed every &s;u&s;picion again&s;t her; but &s;he had too much honour to betray &s;o important a &s;e|cret: and determining with her&s;elf to a&s;k Mr. Methuen's permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;which &s;he did not doubt of obtaining&mdash;to entru&s;t Mr. Went|worth with the knowledge of his marriage; &s;he thought it be&s;t not to touch on the &s;ub|ject till the next week, which was fixed on for their removal to London for the winter. She did not, therefore, contradict the un|intentional fal&s;ehood &s;he at fir&s;t uttered, of the letter being from her brother.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">
If we do not judge by the event, her con|duct was not very imprudent; and, &s;urely, it was no great crime, by &s;ilence to confirm her hu&s;band in a mi&s;take &s;he had not intend|ed to lead him into, and which &s;he meant &s;hould continue but three or four days: yet the fatality that &s;eemed to wait on all her actions, &s;o ordered it, that this little deceit was, in a great mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e of her ruin; for having unthinkingly thrown the cover of the letter on a table that &s;tood by her, he found it, and ea&s;ily di&s;covered Me|thuen's hand in the direction, and his arms in the &s;eal.</P>
<P>The little interval between that time and their going to London, he was almo&s;t con|tinually abroad; and &s;he &s;uffered all the un|ea&s;ine&s;s her &s;ituation may be &s;uppo&s;ed to oc|ca&s;ion; impatiently longing for the time which &s;he expected would put an end to his jealou&s;y, and her own con&s;equent trouble: &mdash;too &s;oon came the time appointed for this unfortunate journey!</P>
<P>The morning after they arrived in town, Mr. Methuen came to wait on them. Mr. Wentworth was not at home; and his lady
<PB N="93" REF="95">&s;eized on that opportunity to make her in|tended reque&s;t, which being immediately granted, &s;he, in return, went to pay a vi&s;it to Mrs. Sydney and her daughter, to whom &s;he had long before promi&s;ed her acquaint|ance.</P>

<P>I &s;hould not think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in leaving England for ever, without ex|plaining my rea&s;ons for taking &s;uch a &s;tep, to a family I am &s;o nearly connect|ed with, and for which I have &s;o perfect a re&s;pect.

<P>I intended to write to you calmly, and tell you every circum&s;tance on which I found my opinion of her guilt; but my hand refu&s;es to trace the odious particu|lars. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, they could not hide their mutual fondne&s;s even before my face; that they corre&s;pond by letters; and&mdash;can I write it!&mdash;make <HI>a&s;&s;ignations!</HI> This la&s;t in&s;upportable injury, I neither knew nor &s;u&s;pected, till ye&s;terday morn|ing. I went to &s;ee my friend Hender&s;on; his &s;ervant &s;aid he had gone out about an hour before, and was expected back every moment. I &s;tepped up to the dining room to wait his return; where I had not been many minutes, when my coach &s;topped at the oppo&s;ite door, and Harriet alighted from it. I &s;aw her en|ter the dining room, and &s;it down. An old lady&mdash;who, doubtle&s;s was the confi|dante
<PB N="97" REF="99">of this infamous amour&mdash;came in: they &s;aluted each other, and talked &s;tand|ing for &s;ome time. The hell-hag then advanced towards a window that was open, and endeavoured to &s;hut it down: at the &s;ame in&s;tant a hackney-chair, the curtains clo&s;e drawn on the in&s;ide, was carried into the hall, the door of which was immediately &s;hut:&mdash;in&s;ufficient pre|cautions!

<P>The hour approaches in which I &s;hall rid the world of a villain, or from his hand receive in&s;en&s;ibility of my wrongs. Adieu, then, Marchmont,&mdash;adieu, for ever.

<P>As this letter was delivered before Mrs. Wentworth, there was no concealing it from her.

<P>The innocent victim of mi&s;placed jea|lou&s;y was in &s;o weak a &s;tate both of body and mind, that lady Marchmont thought it ad|vi&s;eable to keep from her the knowledge of her hu&s;band's death; but her brother was of a different opinion, and with a proper degree of caution, communicated it to her.
<PB N="102" REF="104">He was undoubtedly in the right: great as mu&s;t have been the fir&s;t &s;hock of this dread|ful uncertainty, it was hardly more difficult to &s;upport, than the cruel &s;u&s;pence from which it delivered her.

<P>Lady Marchmont's days were &s;hortened by the too tender &s;ympathy with which &s;he beheld the mi&s;eries of her favourite child.

<P>Religious con&s;iderations a&s;&s;i&s;ting her good under&s;tanding, after &s;ome time, her ten|derly attentive brother had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee her a&s;&s;ume a degree of tranquillity.</P>
<P>All her letters to her &s;i&s;ter &s;peak the re|&s;ignation of a pious mind! yet they &s;ome|times contain &s;uch lively touches of &s;orrow, as would wring compa&s;&s;ion from the harde&s;t heart.</P>

<P>Though he is now near three years dead, a &s;able robe&mdash;which, on others, but too frequently veils a joyful heart&mdash;&s;till conti|nues to make this faithful mourner's per&s;on corre&s;pond with her mind.</P>
<P>She has cau&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;umptuous mo|numental honours to grace her Henry's tomb;&mdash;tho&s;e honours, which greatne&s;s with mimic woe, &s;o often gives to vice!&mdash; The hand of virtuous &s;orrow rai&s;ed them over the remains of the noble, ill-fated Wentworth.</P>
<P>I have been unpardonably negligent, in leaving you all this time to &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Methuen was killed: he was only danger|ou&s;ly wounded.

<OPENER><DATELINE>HERMITAGE.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS met within four miles of Her|mitage this morning, by your lady and my two lovely &s;i&s;ters. Is not Leonora a mo&s;t charming creature! I cannot expre&s;s how much I admire her. What an elegant height and &s;hape! Ju&s;t that air which the <HI>Spectator</HI> &s;o finely calls, <Q>recitative danc|ing.</Q>&mdash;A &s;ymmetry of features, how beau|tiful and exact&mdash;<HI>un teint de lis et de ro&s;e!</HI>&mdash; Such eyes! bright, eloquent, and&mdash;as &s;ome French writer prettily &s;ays&mdash;ju&s;t ready to be tender: ah! <HI>mon Dieu!</HI> what eyes they are! nor France, nor England, can boa&s;t &s;uch ano|ther pair. 'Tis well for Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, and 'tis well for my&s;elf, that this little divinity is my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Now I mention Mi&s;s Orm&s;by,&mdash;you mu&s;t know my affair goes on rapidly: a declara|tion made&mdash;graciou&s;ly received&mdash;and I am actually on my way to London, to propo&s;e
<PB N="105" REF="107">the matter to her father. But enough of this for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Do you recollect a di&s;pute I once held with you and lady Methuen; you both <HI>again&s;t,</HI> and I <HI>for</HI> natural affection? Now, my lord, if there be no &s;uch thing as natural affection between brothers and &s;i&s;ters, on what principle will you account for the warmth wherewith I love a &s;i&s;ter, I am but a few hours acquainted with? My pre&s;ent feelings would enable me to point out the fallacy of all your arguments. Surely, I have no obligations to Leonora; nor is my &s;elf-love &s;atisfied with the recollection of any &s;ervices done to her: the di&s;tance at which we have lived, has prevented the ex|change of kindne&s;&s;es. As a brother, I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to love her for her beauty. She &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s a cultivated under&s;tanding, and a worthy heart; but I am by no means a competent judge of ei|ther&mdash;particularly the latter&mdash;in &s;o &s;hort a time. How comes it then, my friend, but from the mere impul&s;es of fraternal love, that I felt&mdash;as, I &s;wear to you, I did&mdash;a livelier emotion when I pre&s;&s;ed this en|chanting
<PB N="106" REF="108">creature to my bo&s;om, than I ex|perienced in receiving a parting embrace from the woman I mean to make my wife.</P>
<P>How I &s;hould triumph over you, if mv &s;i&s;ter's &s;entiments did not &s;eem to favour your opinion. Perhaps lady Methuen has been poi&s;oning her mind with her cold phi|lo&s;ophy. The dear girl does not at all re|turn my tenderne&s;s. Her behaviour to me is extremely polite, but not affectionate:&mdash; &s;he ju&s;t <HI>&s;uffers</HI> my care&s;&s;es; apparently from the con&s;ideration of my being her brother. I &s;hall really be very unhappy if &s;he will not love me. My dear father was a little capricious in not allowing me to vi&s;it my mother's re|lations. Harriet was twice in France with her grandmother; &s;o &s;he has the good for|tune to po&s;&s;e&s;s Leonora's friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It is late. I am fatigued, and &s;leepy. Adieu.</P>

<P>Lady <HI>Methuen (throwing down a book).</HI> It is &s;urprizing how the whole tribe of novel writers have fallen into this error.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>E. Marchmont.</HI> What error does your lady&s;hip reprehend?</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> That of &s;uppo&s;ing, that a parent and child will feel a reciprocal af|fection, while they are ignorant of the rela|tion&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> And do you think &s;uch a matter impo&s;&s;ible? I take the liberty to differ from you, madam. The ties of na|ture are wonderfully &s;trong, and almo&s;t im|perceptibly fine. I do believe that parents and children, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, or &s;uch near relations, would, by a &s;ecret &s;ympa|thy, an involuntary and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of the mind, find them&s;elves attached to each other, without knowing why.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> My dear Sir Edward, you talk more like a poet than a philo&s;opher; that is to &s;ay, with more elegance than
<PB N="111" REF="113">&s;ound rea&s;oning. For my part, I am in|clined to think, that after we pa&s;s the brute creation, we &s;hall find natural affection to be extremely limitted. The par&s;imony of na|ture has not thought fit to be&s;tow the &s;ame perfect in&s;tinct upon us, as upon other ani|mals; tru&s;ting our pre&s;ervation to our higher powers of mind.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> What then, my friends, you will not allow that the human &s;pecies po&s;&s;e&s;s any of that unerring &s;ympathy, which directs the new-dropt lamb to the teat de&s;igned for its pre&s;ervation, while a hundred other fleecy mothers bleat unheed|ed round.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> No, my flowery friend, I will not allow it. I mu&s;t maintain, that natural affection does not exi&s;t at all with us, uncoupled with knowledge.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> If a child &s;hould be changed at nur&s;e, the &s;uppo&s;ed parents will take the &s;ame care of it, and feel for it the &s;ame fondne&s;s, they would have done to their proper offspring; and the &s;ub&s;titute will experience the &s;ame reverence and af|fection
<PB N="112" REF="114">for them, it would have entertained for its own father and mother.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> I believe your lady&s;hip may be right &s;o far; but this only proves what lord Methuen &s;eemed to hint ju&s;t now &mdash;that other cau&s;es combine to attach us to our offspring. Although the&s;e cau&s;es might &mdash;in the ca&s;e you have mentioned&mdash;&s;eem to &s;upply the place of nature, yet I do not thereby perceive, why the&s;e very parents, if they afterwards became acquainted with their own child, might not love it tenderly without di&s;cerning the cau&s;e; though they might &s;till prefer the imaginary child to the real one, from the nece&s;&s;ary effects of cu&s;|tom and prejudice.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> I fear, Sir Edward, your &s;ympathy &s;tands on a &s;lippery founda|tion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> Well, my lord, what cau&s;es do you &s;uppo&s;e to co-operate with natural affection? for I pre&s;ume you had &s;ome &s;uch meaning when you &s;aid, that our pre&s;ervation was partly tru&s;ted to our higher powers of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> Fir&s;t, then, I will men|tion &mdash;&s;elf-love: that &s;tronge&s;t affection of the mind, which governs us with the mo&s;t uniform and uninterrupted influence; which teaches us to &s;et a peculiar value on an e&s;tate, a hou&s;e, a hor&s;e, a dog, or any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, merely becau&s;e it is our <HI>own.</HI> Children are our property in a more particularly manner than any thing el&s;e: they are part of our&s;elves; they owe their being to us, and entirely depend on us. I mu&s;t not omit, that we always extend good will to a per&s;on we have &s;erved; and kind and tender parents may rea&s;onably think they have laid great obligations on their children. The conferring of favours is a very powerful incentive to love; even more than the receiving of them. Strange as this ob&s;ervation is, its ju&s;tne&s;s cannot be con|te&s;ted. If this part of our tempers is not to be accounted for from &s;elf-love, I believe it is wholly unaccountable.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> There is &s;ome truth, and &s;ome imagination, in your ob&s;ervations. But why will you refer the dear unaccount|able genero&s;ities of our nature to &s;elf-love?
<PB N="114" REF="116">You confu&s;e my ideas. I no longer know what you mean by the term. Surely there is nothing &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted as parental affection.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> It is, indeed, difficult to mark where &s;elf-love runs into the &s;ocial. But, my lord, Sir Edward expects you to find &s;ome more amiable auxiliaries to natu|ral affection.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> A &s;en&s;e of duty mu&s;t powerfully influence any mind not utterly depraved. Compa&s;&s;ion &s;oftly induces us to love an infant in its helple&s;s &s;tate; and as it grows up, we admire its beauty, e&s;teem its merit, and are grateful for its gratitude.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> There are in&s;tances of pa|rents loving children without beauty, merit, or gratitude.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> If the parents are un|worthy them&s;elves, it is little more &s;urpriz|ing that they &s;hould love their unworthy off|&s;pring, than that bad people &s;hould love them&s;elves. Be&s;ides, you mu&s;t allow a great deal for the force of habit: a parent loves a child many years before it can be guilty of vices for which youth may not form a &s;ufficient excu&s;e. And though you
<PB N="115" REF="117">deny the power of &s;elf-love, you mu&s;t grant, that a &s;en&s;e of duty and of compa&s;|&s;ion, &s;till remains to aid the powerful in|&s;tinctive fondne&s;s of nature, which will ope|rate in favour of the child, whether de|&s;erving or unde&s;erving.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> Let us admire the wi&s;|dom of Providence, which has not left the care of the infant to depend on the good|ne&s;s of the parent. The love of children to their parents, ari&s;es almo&s;t entirely from their own virtue, and the de&s;ert on the other &s;ide. The love of parents towards their children, is an in&s;tinct, not materially dif|fering from the in&s;tinct of brutes; like all other in&s;tincts, impelling from feeling to action, without any deductions of rea&s;on. We &s;ee that the parent, who has not virtue to nouri&s;h the &s;oul by education, guided by unerring in&s;tinct, protects and cheri&s;hes the helple&s;s body.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> I mu&s;t own my&s;elf in|clined to think, that natural affection does not &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all, at lea&s;t not with any con&s;i|derable force, except from the parent to the child.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118">
Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> From what &s;ource do you derive our affection to our parents? If they be good, you &s;ay, from gratitude and e&s;teem. But &s;uppo&s;e them bad.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> Habit, and a &s;en&s;e of duty, may create all the affection they can be imagined to feel.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> If the parent has been al|ways bad, a habit of loving them could &s;carcely ever have taken place: and as to duty&mdash;it rules the actions only, not the heart; it gives the external marks of affec|tion, but cannot po&s;&s;ibly in&s;pire it. Now, from what, but the &s;ecret workings of nature, ari&s;es love to a parent, who&s;e character we cannot e&s;teem, and from whom we have received no obligations?</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> My dear Marchmont, you are &s;uppo&s;ing a mere chimera. There are very few &s;uch parents as you de&s;cribe; and tho&s;e few, you may depend on it, are not loved by their children.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> Well, my friends, I hope you will at lea&s;t allow, that fraternal affec|tion is &s;omething more than friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> Perhaps fraternal affec|tion
<PB N="117" REF="119">is only friend&s;hip. I grant you, we generally feel a more lively tenderne&s;s for our brothers and &s;i&s;ters, than for any other friends; yet this may not be occa&s;ioned by the &s;ympathy of nature, but becau&s;e we have had more opportunities of knowing them, and exchanging obligations with them.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Methuen.</HI> Our love to our bro|thers, &s;i&s;ters, and relations in general, may in a great mea&s;ure be attributed to our having lived con&s;tantly among&s;t them; and being, for that rea&s;on, better acquainted with them than with other people.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> I fancy we &s;hall end our di&s;pute, as di&s;putes are generally ended&mdash; with all parties retaining their own opinions. I mu&s;t &s;till condemn the ab&s;urdity of the novel writer, who &s;hall de&s;cribe unknown relations di&s;tingui&s;hing each other by an ir|re&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e: and Sir Edward will &s;till maintain his beloved &s;ympathy&mdash;natural af|fection to all degrees of relation&s;hip, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> I acknowledge that my opinion has been oppo&s;ed by &s;trong argu|ments: yet &s;till I mu&s;t per&s;uade my&s;elf,
<PB N="118" REF="120">that were I by any accident to meet my &s;i&s;ter Leonora, whom I have not &s;een &s;ince we were both children, my heart would in|&s;tantly di&s;tingui&s;h her.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Methuen.</HI> If you did not know her, you would give her but the &s;ame por|tion of e&s;teem, that you would accord to the &s;ame degree of merit in another. And if you conceived a friend&s;hip for her, im|mediately on finding her to be your &s;i&s;ter, it would be wholly the effect of a &s;trong imagination, bia&s;&s;ed by prejudice, operating on a good and tender heart.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day I attended the too charming Mi&s;s O'Bryen to lord Linfield's. I was not a little chagrined, on calling at your hou&s;e, to find you had already for&s;aken the gaieties of the town, for the &s;erener plea&s;ures of Poplar-hill. Why did you go, Methuen? I never wanted a friend &s;o much as at this period. Your advice&mdash;but why do I talk of your advice?&mdash;you would give me &s;uch as I have not fortitude to take. How little have I already profited by your wi&s;e coun&s;el! You warned me not to engage my&s;elf to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by.&mdash;I did; and &s;everely repent it.&mdash; You bade me fly Mi&s;s O'Bryen;&mdash;I did not; and am irretrievably undone!</P>
<P>What a number of little circum&s;tances con&s;pired again&s;t me!&mdash;I gave free admit|tance to love, under the di&s;gui&s;e of frater|nal affection; and, far from re&s;i&s;ting the dangerous intruder, I fancied there was a merit in cheri&s;hing it. The deceit, indeed,
<PB N="120" REF="122">la&s;ted only a day. But what will not &s;uch attractions do, in a &s;ingle day? The man|ner of my introduction to her, naturally prevented the &s;tiffne&s;s and formality that is apt to attend a beginning acquaintance, and placed us on the mo&s;t ea&s;y and agreeable footing imaginable. I gave my&s;elf up, without reflection, to the &s;educing charms of her conver&s;ation. I thought I li&s;tened to her with delight, only becau&s;e &s;he &s;poke the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e, adorned by the &s;ofte&s;t eloquence; and gazed on her with rapture, only becau&s;e &s;he was exqui&s;itely beautiful. Your friendly letter brought me the fir&s;t in|timationof my danger: I then &s;aw there was a nece&s;&s;ity for my quitting her; but deceived my&s;elf &s;o far, as to think it would be more prudent to &s;tay at Hermitage&mdash; where &s;he was to remain but two days&mdash; than to go to London, where &s;he was go|ing. I did not think of the affair that &s;hould have called me there; nor how ea&s;y it is, in fuch a place, to avoid a per&s;on that does not &s;eek you. Harriet's illne&s;s pro|longed her &s;tay. I ought to have gone&mdash;it
<PB N="121" REF="123">was impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;&s;o firmly had love, in &s;ilken fetters, bound my &s;oul!</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, my con&s;cience reminded me of my engagements, and reproached me with giving to another what was Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's due; but I &s;oon learned to &s;tifle its admo|nitions: and the lovely Valeria's tender and affectionate care of my poor &s;i&s;ter, though little more than a &s;tranger to her; her unre|mitting endeavours to amu&s;e her; afforded me &s;o many opportunities of admiring the goodne&s;s of her heart, that I almo&s;t thought I was in the right to love her. Ah! how cautious ought we to be of familiarizing our&s;elves to what we di&s;approve! &s;ince we thereby confound the notions of right and wrong in our minds, and utterly lo&s;e that nice di&s;cernment, which at fir&s;t marked out the boundaries of each, and that delicate &s;en&s;ibility which &s;hrunk from the appear|ance of evil.</P>

<P>I have written to lady Conway, to apolo|gize for my negligence. I ventured to defer my wretchedne&s;s a little, by po&s;tponing my application to Mr. Orm&s;by till &s;he comes to town.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">
While I was at Hermitage, I had not the courage to think of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by; my &s;i&s;ter, therefore, was totally ignorant of my affairs. As I did not think it would be u&s;ing her well, to &s;uffer her to remain &s;o any longer, I wrote to her ye&s;terday even|ing. I would not let her perceive I was melancholy; but, on the contrary, affected a gaiety, that was far&mdash;oh! very far&mdash;from my heart: nor did I once mention Mi&s;s O'Bryen's too dear name; not that I &s;hould he&s;itate to confide in her, but becau&s;e I know her unbounded affection for me would make her mi&s;erable, if &s;he knew the half of what I &s;uffer; and I would not add a feather's weight to the load of woe &s;he bears, to be for ever exempt from &s;orrow. By the return of my &s;ervant, this morning, I have her an&s;wer. What penetration wo|men have! Let me give you an extract from her letter:</P>
<P><Q>Though to &s;ee you united to &s;ome worthy woman, has long been the favou|rite wi&s;h of my heart, yet, I own, I am far from being plea&s;ed to find you &s;o much nearer matrimony, than I imagined
<PB N="128" REF="130">you were. Mi&s;s Orm&s;by may&mdash;nay, &s;ince &s;he is your choice, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be amiable; but I am po&s;itive &s;he is not equal to my dear Valeria. Indeed, Ed|ward, you have deceived me &s;trangely: never will I pretend to read the heart again, &s;ince Mi&s;s O'Bryen is not the mi&s;tre&s;s of your's. You have greatly di&s;appointed me; I had ab&s;olutely &s;et my heart on an union between you and this lovely girl. Till I knew her, I never wi&s;hed you to attach your&s;elf to a beau|ty; as I believe they have generally more foibles, than fall to the &s;hare of al|mo&s;t any other denomination of females: but &s;he &s;eems to have no faults. How was it po&s;&s;ible for you, when you &s;aw and heard her, to retain a thought of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by? I am certain you did forget her for the time; and I heartily wi&s;h you had forgotten her for ever. Such a &s;uperior creature as Valeria would have ju&s;tified incon&s;tancy. Though &s;he has no fortune, I had rather &s;ee you married to a de|&s;cendant of the families of Sedley and
<PB N="129" REF="131">O'Bryen, than to a merchant's daughter with millions!</Q></P>
<P>And has not my Valeria a fortune? O, ye unpitying powers! why am I not at li|berty to lay mine at her feet? What value has money, compared to her worth? I cannot de&s;cribe to you the variety of tor|menting &s;en&s;ations, every pa&s;&s;age of Har|riet's letter excites: between it, and my own reflections, I am really little le&s;s than di&s;tracted.

In&s;ipid &s;tate, however! and to be wi&s;hed for only by wretches, who, like me, are doomed to mi&s;ery that can end but with life.</P>

<P>I "TRIUMPH over you!" Ah! Leonora, how little do you know me! Nor do I think I have cau&s;e to triumph;&mdash; &s;en&s;ible, as I am, that love much oft'ner flows from the caprice of a lover, than the merit of the object beloved. But why, my dear girl, are you &s;o &s;oon di&s;couraged? Did you think he could transfer his affection in a few days? You mu&s;t give him time to forget his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;you mu&s;t &s;teal imperceptibly into his heart. Have pa|tience, my friend; continue your friend&s;hip to him; con&s;ole him, but forbear to cheri&s;h his hopes: it was your wild project of &s;end|ing him to England that has thus far impeded your &s;ucce&s;s. If you will pur&s;ue the plan I take the liberty to trace out to you, I am per&s;uaded you cannot fail of attaching him to you, and that more &s;trongly than he ever was to me. Gratitude, that amiable affec|tion, which &s;o powerfully &s;ways the gene|rous
<PB N="135" REF="137">mind, will exert all its influence for you; and give you, on his under&s;tanding, on his honour, and his heart, a tie&mdash;addi|tional to any I ever could have had.</P>
<P>May I tell you, Mi&s;s Marchmont, you are indu&s;trious to torment your&s;elf? Why, el&s;e, tho&s;e extravagant &s;elf-accu&s;ations? What is the mighty injury you have done Mon&s;. de St. Clair?&mdash;Deprived him of a woman, who has not a &s;hilling of fortune in the world:&mdash;a woman who felt no ten|derer &s;entiments for him, than tho&s;e which friend&s;hip dictated; and, in exchange, you give him riches and love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take a &s;eparate paper, which I in&s;i&s;t on your &s;hewing to the marquis.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>How, my Leonora, have I forfeited the place I held in your affection? Or, rather how has Mon&s;ieur de St. Clair attained a higher one? And a higher one he certainly does po&s;&s;e&s;s, or you would never have thought of making my acceptance of him the condition of the continuance of your
<PB N="136" REF="138">friend&s;hip to me. You are cruel, my friend; you are unju&s;t. Can I command the emo|tions of my heart? Does not the marquis's giving way to a pa&s;&s;ion, he ought for every rea&s;on to conquer, tell you that love is in|voluntary? And if it be &s;o hard to de&s;troy&mdash; is it, do you think, ea&s;y to create? I e&s;teem him, I admire him;&mdash;but &s;till, it is only e&s;teem&mdash;it is only admiration&mdash;without a &s;ingle &s;park of love. I &s;hall venture to leave it even to your partial deci&s;ion, whe|ther or not, with the&s;e cold, unchangeably cold &s;entiments, I ought to give him my hand?</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t knew him, I preferred him to every other male acquaintance. The friend&s;hip he profe&s;&s;ed for me, plea&s;ed and flattered me. He &s;poke not of love; and if his behaviour &s;ometimes indicated it, I attribu|ted it to the gallantry of his nation. He kept me a long time in this agreeable error; I believe by lady Enmore's advice, who knew my di&s;po&s;ition, and rightly &s;uppo&s;ed, that a declaration on his part, would be fol|lowed by a refu&s;al on mine. At length, &s;he thought proper to propo&s;e him to me, as a
<PB N="137" REF="139">match every way de&s;irable, and greatly above any thing my circum&s;tances in life could warrant me to expect. Her argu|ments were chiefly drawn from prudence; yet &s;he did not fail to do ju&s;tice to his merit, though without po&s;itively a&s;&s;erting&mdash;like another fair advocate of his&mdash;that he had <Q>all the graces that can adorn a human being!</Q> Ah! Leonora, I would to Heaven he had! 'twould be well for my peace, if&mdash;But, to return to my &s;ubject: &mdash;Wearied by lady Enmore's importuni|ties, I with difficulty con&s;ented to delibe|rate on the matter for a month. I exacted, in return for this conce&s;&s;ion, that &s;he would not let him know &s;he had mentioned the affair to me at all. In this, however, I have good rea&s;on to believe &s;he did not keep her word with me; for he&mdash;flattered, without doubt, by my conduct&mdash;threw off the re&s;traint he had hitherto worn, and talked to me ince&s;&s;antly of his pa&s;&s;ion. I was &s;o far moved by my &s;en&s;ibility of his worth, that I determined with my&s;elf to endeavour to love him: but in&s;tead of be|ing able to effect this; I found I liked him
<PB N="138" REF="140">le&s;s, after I had made the re&s;olution, than before. I was u&s;ed to welcome him as a friend;&mdash;I now &s;hunned him as a creditor, who demanded of me what he had a ju&s;t title to, but what it was not in my power to pay him. The promi&s;e which had been extorted from me, con&s;trained me to li&s;ten to him. My indefatigable friend, lady En|more, took advantage of the time &s;he had gained, to write to my aunt Chetwynd, who&s;e a&s;cendant over my mind &s;he was no &s;tranger to. In effect, my aunt wrote to me, and approved the marquis's addre&s;&s;es; but it was only on condition, if I approved them my&s;elf: and, le&s;t her letter &s;hould in|fluence me too much, &s;he even advi&s;ed me not to marry him, unle&s;s I loved him. I balanced no longer; but determining to break off the matter at once, I left France; thinking I could not take a more effectual method of re&s;toring St. Clair that peace, which I was &s;incerely grieved to have in any mea&s;ure deprived him of. After this deci&s;ive &s;tep, I am a&s;toni&s;hed to be told he can entertain any hopes of me; even though you &s;hould have left him to imagine
<PB N="139" REF="141">my going was occa&s;ioned by my aunt Chet|wynd's writing to me to come home with the Domville family; which, you know, was the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on of my departure. &mdash;I cannot help thinking you have greatly &s;oftened the refu&s;al I commi&s;&s;ioned you to give him: it was polite, indeed&mdash;at lea&s;t I intended it &s;hould be &s;o&mdash;but it was peremp|tory; it was &s;uch as would not have encou|raged him to follow me. If he chu&s;es to come to England, I cannot prevent him: but that I may not in any re&s;pect be the ob|ject of his voyage, I declare &s;olemnly, if he comes, I will not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I &s;latter my&s;elf you are too ju&s;t to be of|fended at my paying &s;o little regard to your threats and intreaties on this &s;ubject, when I tell you, that my uncle and aunt Chet|wynd have acknowledged to me, it would have made them mi&s;erable, had I married a foreigner. After this, I &s;hould refu&s;e Mon&s;ieur de St. Clair without he&s;itating, were he dearer to me than the <Q>ruddy drops that warm my heart.</Q> I am &s;ure he him&s;elf would confe&s;s, that I ought to do &s;o, if he knows any thing of my obligations
<PB N="140" REF="142">to them. They have been more than pa|rents to me, ever &s;ince it plea&s;ed the Al|mighty to deprive me of my father and mother. Their pecuniary favours to me, only, con&s;idered&mdash;without mentioning their affection, their indulgence, the graceful manner of giving which, doubles the gift, &mdash;I &s;ay, their pecuniary favours, only, con|&s;idered, I &s;hould be the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t ungrateful of human kind, were I capable of voluntarily giving a moment's pain to the honourable donors.</P>
<P>It has ju&s;t come into my head, to de&s;ire you to let the marquis peru&s;e this letter. If he be offended at the freedom wherewith I have treated him, let him con&s;ider, that the &s;ubject required plain dealing. I &s;et a high value on his friend&s;hip; but I would rather lo&s;e it, than po&s;&s;e&s;s his love.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding your threats, my dear Leonora, I am bold enough to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><Q>DOES Sir Edward Marchmont love my Valeria?</Q>&mdash;Dear madam, why did you a&s;k this que&s;tion? You know not how &s;en&s;ibly it mortified me. Yet I will an&s;wer it with &s;incerity;&mdash;he does not; and I had believed he did.&mdash;Let me, my honoured, my beloved friend, confe&s;s to you all my folly.&mdash;While I was at Hermitage, Sir Ed|ward's behaviour to me was &s;uch, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me not to ima|gine my&s;elf dear to him. This fatal per|&s;ua&s;ion made me little careful to &s;hut my heart again&s;t him. Mrs. Wentworth's in|&s;inuations confirmed my error: but &s;he, I am convinced, was very far from having any intention to deceive me; &s;he was de|ceived her&s;elf. The tender and con&s;tant attention, the delicate compliments he paid me, &s;eemed to have their &s;ource in his heart: he followed me every where, with|out appearing to know that he did &s;o: it
<PB N="143" REF="145">could not be mere chance, that always placed his chair next mine: if his hand ac|cidentally touched mine, he trembled: he would frequently heave deep &s;ighs, even in the mid&s;t of a chearful conver&s;ation; and look on me with a tenderne&s;s, which unne|ce&s;&s;arily borrowed from melancholy, an ad|ditional power to touch the &s;oul. This de|&s;cription, far from being exaggerated, is really imperfect: judge from it, if I had not rea&s;on to think he loved me.</P>
<P>To apologize, in &s;ome &s;ort, for my weak|ne&s;s, I will draw you a faint picture&mdash;for a faint one it mu&s;t be&mdash;of this accompli&s;hed man:</P>
<P>Sir Edward Marchmont is indi&s;putably one of the be&s;t made men in England; tall, rather &s;lender, and inimitably proportioned; his per&s;on gives the joint ideas. of, &s;trength and activity, dignity and gracefulne&s;s. His face is &s;trikingly hand&s;ome; though not regularly &s;o: a clear brown complexion; ro&s;y lips; white and even teeth; open fore|head; arched brow; and dark hazel eyes, penetrating, &s;parkling with vivacity and good-humour, and, when he plea&s;es, &s;e|ducingly
<PB N="144" REF="146">tender. His addre&s;s is mo&s;t po|lite; manly, but not forward. No pen can de&s;cribe the varied charms of his con|ver&s;ation. Would you form an idea of it? &mdash;Imagine every thing that &s;ound &s;en&s;e, exten&s;ive knowledge, lively wit, and ge|nerou&s;ly warm feelings can dictate; dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t elegant words, that language can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>Allow me to add a mo&s;t romantic excu&s;e, for a romantic pa&s;&s;ion:&mdash;Hermitage is the very land of love: Nature has dealt it beauties with a lavi&s;h hand; which have been heightened and improved by the ta&s;te of its owner. The wild variety of the &s;cene delights and &s;urpri&s;es the eye.&mdash;The Spring had thrown her verdant mantle o'er the lawns; and tho&s;e early flowers, of ha&s;ty duration,&mdash;me&s;&s;engers of Spring, to an|nounce the coming Summer&mdash;&s;hed their grateful perfumes around. The plea&s;ing &s;tillne&s;s of the new&mdash;and then but half|dre&s;&s;ed groves, was interrupted only by ca&s;cades; gurgling &s;treams; and the notes of euphony and gladne&s;s, poured forth by the little feathered &s;ong&s;ters.&mdash;Rural de|lights
<PB N="145" REF="147">create a placid &s;erenity in the mind, which is wonderfully favourable to love; and the &s;weet &s;adne&s;s in&s;pired by pity, in beholding the unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s of this charming place, gives a &s;oftne&s;s to the heart, which di&s;po&s;es it ea&s;ily and deeply to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of a virtuous pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>I wrote the above ye&s;terday; and have read it over this morning with blu&s;hes. I was going to de&s;troy it, but re&s;trained my|&s;elf: my friend, my parent, you have a right to my confidence; and never will I defraud you of it. I have ever found you a far more indulgent monitor, than that within my own brea&s;t. I have erred deep|ly; but not inexcu&s;ably; and I will&mdash;yes, madam, I will recover my pa&s;t involuntary mi&s;conduct: your Valeria will <Q>act like her&s;elf!</Q> with pride I quote this &s;en|tence from one of your affectionate letters.</P>
<P>To &s;pare my&s;elf the pain of renewing this dangerous &s;ubject, I &s;end you a letter
<PB N="146" REF="148">of Mrs. Wentworth's: &s;he has been my corre&s;pondent ever &s;ince I left her.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that Sir Edward did not fix his choice on a woman of family?</P>
<P><Q>And why &s;urpri&s;ing? A merchant's daughter, in the eyes of rea&s;on and re|ligion &mdash;</Q></P>
<P>But in the eyes of the world, madam, &s;he will di&s;grace the Marchmont blood.</P>
<P>"Such things are done every day."</P>
<P>True; but for what are they done? Ne|ce&s;&s;ity or avarice: the fir&s;t cannot be Sir Edward's motive, and he has a &s;oul above the la&s;t. He loves her then; 'tis very plain; he can have no other inducement.&mdash; I relap&s;e into folly.&mdash;Forgive me.&mdash;'Tis the la&s;t time.&mdash;I now quit the &s;ubject for ever. Nor my pen, nor my thoughts, &s;hall dwell on him more.</P>
<P>I cannot tell you what &s;tay I &s;hall make here. Mr. Domville talks of &s;etting out &s;oon for Ireland; but the Linfield family will not hear of our going. Ob&s;erve, I include my&s;elf. I have the honour to &s;tand very high in Lady Linfield's good grace: and am a &s;ingular favourite with his lord|&s;hip;
<PB N="147" REF="149">who very confidently &s;wears, I am the hand&s;ome&s;t woman in the world.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me news of Lady Mary En|more&mdash;Web&s;ter, I mean:&mdash;I know nothing more concerning her, than her mother has already told you. I flatter my&s;elf I need not &s;ay what an&s;wer I intend to give to Lady Enmore's too generous propo&s;ition. God forbid I &s;hould ever accept what ought to be the property of another! Far from the meanne&s;s of u&s;urping Lady Mary's place in her mother's favour, I &s;hall do every thing in my power to re&s;tore her to it: even at the hazard of di&s;obliging Lady Enmore, for whom I have a high con&s;i|deration.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN mere compliments daily ex|hau&s;t the language that &s;hould be &s;acred to friend&s;hip, and unfelt and undue thanks are given in the mo&s;t weighty and &s;ignificant form of words, it becomes impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;incere and ju&s;tly grateful heart to expre&s;s its feelings. I mu&s;t then, my dear lady Enmore, forbear to make you tho&s;e ac|knowledgements I owe to your genero&s;ity; con&s;cious of my utter incapacity to pay them as I ought. But I expect you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, I have the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of your kindne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>I intreat you not to be offended, that I frankly tell you, I cannot accept your of|fer:&mdash;I dare not; it would be robbery! While you have a child, or a grandchild, in the world, nothing &s;hall prevail on me to take any part of your fortune.</P>
<P>I have, a long time, honoured my&s;elf by regarding you on the equal ground of
<PB N="149" REF="151">friend&s;hip: excu&s;e me, that I am unwil|ling now to de&s;cend from this height, and look up to you as a benefactre&s;s. 'Tis true, you &s;eek to &s;often the idea of dependance, by calling me daughter; but it will not do. Pardon the pride of noble blood. It was not till after many painful &s;truggles, I could con&s;ent to be &s;upported by my uncle Chet|wynd. The inexpre&s;&s;ible delicacy of his conduct to me, at length reconciled me to receiving unreturnable obligations; and at pre&s;ent my gratitude is even plea&s;urable; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, I &s;hould not chu&s;e to have any other hand be&s;tow the like favours.&mdash; Wrong me not &s;o much, as to &s;uppo&s;e, I at all doubt <HI>your</HI> delicacy: but relation&s;hip makes a wide difference, in this ca&s;e, be|tween Mr. Chetwynd and your lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary to multiply excu&s;es for my unavoidable refu&s;al, I might add, that my aunt Chetwynd would have good rea&s;on to accu&s;e me of ingratitude, were I to chu&s;e any other mother than her&s;elf. See! ma|dam, I have both a father and a mother!&mdash; Poor lady Mary has no father; and you would deprive her of her mother!</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">
I am &s;en&s;ible that it mu&s;t be a very trying thing, when the object of the tender cares, and fond anxieties of years, by an impru|dent marriage, bla&s;ts all tho&s;e long-cheri&s;h|ed, high expectations, which a parent na|turally entertains for a beloved child. But who is the per&s;on injured by this ra&s;h &s;tep? &mdash;The party who takes it, undoubtedly. Will it be ju&s;tifiable then, my friend, to puni&s;h your daughter with your everla&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure, becau&s;e &s;he has ruined <HI>her&s;elf?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Web&s;ter, you &s;ay, is meanly born; has di&s;&s;ipated his fortune and reputation:&mdash; a dreadful character! What countenance will be nece&s;&s;ary to lady Mary, to &s;creen her from the cen&s;ures of the world!&mdash;from the contempt and ill-treatment of the very man, to whom &s;he has &s;acrificed &s;o much! Can you, who have hitherto been her be&s;t friend, for&s;ake her in that critical conjunc|ture, when &s;he mo&s;t wants your a&s;&s;i&s;tance? &mdash;yes, more than in the helple&s;s days of in|fancy. I beg you to con&s;ider, how much your neglect will put her in her hu&s;band's power: and by your own account of him, it is too probable he will abu&s;e his advan|tages.
<PB N="151" REF="153">&mdash;O, do not, by your &s;everity, in|crea&s;e all the mi&s;eries that may be con&s;e|quent on her mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>I a&s;k no more for this giddy couple, at pre&s;ent, than forgivene&s;s and friend&s;hip. I would by no means recommend it to you, to give them up any part of your fortune, nor even to promi&s;e it; only forbear to &s;ay you will <HI>not</HI> make them your heirs, and Mr. Web&s;ter mu&s;t naturally &s;uppo&s;e you <HI>will.</HI> The con&s;ideration of his own intere&s;t will induce him to behave well to his wife: and perhaps his re&s;pect, e&s;teem, and grati|tude, may empower you to influence him to a reformation of his life. I &s;trongly ad|vi&s;e you to make no di&s;po&s;ition of your fortune at pre&s;ent. Settle it, at your death, on lady Mary and her children. If you do not give it to her, to whom will you give it? The per&s;ons that would accept it, in prejudice to her rights, would, by that &s;in|gle action, prove them&s;elves unworthy of it: and &s;ure you will, at lea&s;t, &s;hew a pre|ference to your daughter, among&s;t the <HI>un|de&s;erving!</HI> Can you, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, bequeath an e&s;tate you received from lord
<PB N="152" REF="154">Enmore, to any other than lord Enmore's only child? The di&s;cretionary power he left you, was not, I imagine, in any ca&s;e, to deprive lady Mary of his fortune; but &s;olely to re&s;train her from the very fault, which, notwith&s;tanding his caution, &s;he has unhappily committed. He, doubtle&s;s, de|pended on your tenderne&s;s for her. Will you, then, betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you by one of the be&s;t, and fonde&s;t of hu&s;bands? Would it not be di&s;honourable?

<P>Pardon me, deare&s;t lady Enmore, that, for a moment waving the re&s;pect due to your &s;uperior under&s;tanding and maturer years, I have pre&s;umed to offer you my ad|vice.

<P>SUPPORT me! my ine&s;timable friend! &mdash;Pride has hitherto been my chief prop, on that "weak &s;ide, where mo&s;t our nature fails;" and pride no longer aids me. I blu&s;hed at the meanne&s;s of be&s;towing my heart on a man to whom I was indifferent, who even loved another. Fatally for my peace, I am now convinced that I am the mi&s;tre&s;s of his affections; although for&s;ome cau&s;e, to me unknown, he is obliged to give his hand to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by. I inclo&s;e you the copy of a letter I received from him this morning. I dare not make any comments.&mdash;Yet, pardon me, I mu&s;t. It is evident to me, that Sir Edward's mind was ill at ea&s;e when he wrote that letter; every expre&s;&s;ion betrays di&s;quiet:&mdash;he was "extremely embarra&s;&s;ed:"&mdash;there was nothing in the affair that could have em|barra&s;&s;ed an indifferent per&s;on.

<P>WE came to town ye&s;terday. Sir James called at your hou&s;e this morning, and there learned you were at lord Methuen's &s;eat. Are you not a &s;trange fellow, Sir Edward? Upon my life, one would al|mo&s;t imagine you were &s;hunning us. How|ever, I &s;uppo&s;e you will now venture to London, as we are here to introduce you to Mr. Orm&s;by.

<OPENER><DATELINE>LONDON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TIME ever flies on leaden wings, when my Loui&s;a is ab&s;ent. I have been but a week away from you; &s;o &s;ays the almanack; but my heart contradicts it. How &s;olitary is this hou&s;e without you!&mdash;how &s;ilent with|out my prattling boy!</P>
<P>Our dear Marchmont is with me; I would not &s;uffer him to go to his own hou&s;e; I do not leave him a moment alone; his is not the kind of grief that &s;hould be in|dulged. I endeavour to lead him into agreeable company&mdash;into amu&s;ing di&s;&s;ipa|tion. All will not do: a &s;ettled melancholy has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind. In pre|&s;ence of the Orm&s;by family, he &s;trives to a&s;&s;ume an air of &s;prightline&s;s, but with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed they do not di&s;cover his affectation. Mi&s;s Orm&s;by mu&s;t have very little penetration, or a great deal of vanity, if &s;he can believe he loves
<PB N="161" REF="163">her. From my &s;oul I pity him: condemn|ed to feign a pa&s;&s;ion that he does not feel, and to conceal one that preys&mdash;ah! my Loui&s;a, I fear&mdash;upon his life. He re|proaches him&s;elf with weakne&s;s. For my part, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the noble firmne&s;s, wherewith he &s;acrifices the deare&s;t wi&s;hes of his heart to motives of genero&s;ity and ho|nour. Yet I &s;incerely wi&s;h he had been le&s;s determined. Now, indeed, it is too late to retract: but before he came to town, I think he might have made an ef|fort to free him&s;elf from this mo&s;t irk&s;ome bondage. I could not bring him over to my opinion: perhaps he was in the right. In his &s;ituation, I &s;hould probably have thought&mdash;though I might not have been able to act&mdash;like him. If I have any knowledge of my heart, it would be apter to dupe my judgment in my friend's favour than in my own.</P>
<P>You a&s;k my opinion of the Orm&s;by fa|mily. &mdash;To begin with Mr. Orm&s;by:&mdash;he is a plain, &s;en&s;ible, good kind of man; has rather more of the merchant than the gen|tleman in his manners.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164">
Mrs. Orm&s;by has more politene&s;s, and le&s;s under&s;tanding than her hu&s;band. She has been very pretty in her time; and, unfor|tunately, thinks her&s;elf &s;o &s;till: pays the mo&s;t critical attention to her dre&s;s, and gives her&s;elf &s;everal little airs, that would better &s;uit her daughters.</P>
<P>Every one allows, that youth is the mo|nopolizer of beauty. How comes it, then, that women who have been hand&s;ome in their younger years, carry the idea of their loveline&s;s into advanced life? Yet how, indeed, can it be expected they &s;hould per|ceive the gradual decay of their beauty, when they are in&s;en&s;ible of the progre&s;s of their years?</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis greatly wi&s;e to know, before we're told,</L>
<L>"The melancholy news that we grow old."</L></Q>
<P>Aye, or to believe it when told. Why cannot women's ambition be directed rather to the embelli&s;hment of their minds, than their forms? What a happine&s;s it would be, if the beauty of all females was, like lady Methuen's, eclip&s;ed by the &s;uperior
<PB N="163" REF="165">brightne&s;s of their under&s;tandings! Age, then, in&s;tead of &s;tealing away all their charms, would only deprive them of &s;ome trifling, extrin&s;ic advantages, and be&s;tow &s;ome intrin&s;ically valuable ones in their room. TIME is, in the main, a generous robber: with one hand, indeed, he wre&s;ts from us part of our property, whether we will or not; but with the other, he offers us more than double the worth of what he takes: it is at our own option to accept, or refu&s;e his liberality; but if we refu&s;e it, we have only our&s;elves to blame.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e who have more to fear from the predatory hand of Time, than to hope for from his bounteous one, I think we may fairly rank lady Conway. She is what her mother has been; and, if I do not mi&s;take, will be what her mother is. I would not be united to &s;uch a woman for kingdoms;&mdash;&s;o volatile, &s;o gay, &s;o vain and incon&s;iderate; &s;o politely inattentive to her hu&s;band, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o very attentive to other men&mdash;Take care of your forehead, my good Sir James; if horns will grow out of lead, you have but
<PB N="164" REF="166">a &s;orry chance of e&s;caping &s;uch an orna|ment. It is a fa&s;hionable one, however; and that is &s;ome con&s;olation. Luckily, he does not care three-pence for his wife; which, for the repo&s;e of my &s;ex, I heartily wi&s;h was the ca&s;e of every hone&s;t man, who has the ill fortune to be married to a co|quette.</P>
<P>As to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by her&s;elf, I need &s;ay little more, than that Sir Edward's de&s;crip|tion of her&mdash;which, without doubt, you remember&mdash;was a very ju&s;t one. I really believe her to be an amiable girl; yet, &s;till, &s;till &s;he is not worthy of Marchmont! There is nothing exalted in her character: her talents, her under&s;tanding, are not above the common level.&mdash;In a word, &s;he is not an O'Bryen! He would never have di&s;tingui&s;hed her, but from the per&s;ua&s;ion that he was nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s, A few more &s;uch examples, and your &s;ex would no longer accu&s;e mine of the ingrati|tude, or caprice, or cruelty; of continually de&s;pi&s;ing the woman who loves una&s;ked.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday&mdash;Marchmont being fortu|nately engaged at Mr. Orm&s;by's&mdash;I
<PB N="165" REF="167">dined with our friend dean Domville. The company was compo&s;ed of his elder bro|thers, lord Linfield, and Mr. Domville; their ladies; Mi&s;s O'Bryen, the young counte&s;s dowager of Severn, Mr. and Mrs. Warner, and two or three young gentlemen, who vied with each other in rendering the lowlie&s;t homage to the awe-creating, but all-attractive charms of the fair Hiber|nian, who treated them all with equal po|litene&s;s, and equal indifference. In vain did the maje&s;tic beauty di&s;regard their at|tention; in vain did the langui&s;hing eyes of the right honourable widow court it: 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for Mi&s;s O'Bryen to be unnoticed; 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for any other woman to be taken notice of in her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with you, Loui&s;a, that this fine young creature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mind equal to her form. She &s;poke but little at the dean's, and that on common topics; but I want no other proof of her good &s;en&s;e, than her being &s;o totally devoid of vanity. How uncon&s;cious does &s;he appear of her &s;uperlative loveline&s;s! How unde&s;irous of admiration! What a dignified mode&s;ty in
<PB N="166" REF="168">her deportment! Certainly &s;he is a mo&s;t charming woman. Ah! why was &s;he not de&s;tined for my de&s;erving friend?</P>
<P>I &s;hould not forget to tell you, Mi&s;s O'Bryen enquired for you in &s;uch a manner, as convinces me you have a place in her friend&s;hip. I am &s;orry, very &s;orry you can|not cultivate it. 'Tis well you are not in town; you could not avoid vi&s;iting her; and I would not, for any con&s;ideration, Sir Edward &s;hould &s;ee her again: yet I doubt that he could love her to a greater exce&s;s than he does already, or be more deeply involved in con&s;equential mi&s;ery. I know not whether to pity or admire him mo&s;t. To be obliged to re&s;ign the object he adores! to wed another!&mdash;with &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o much delicacy as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es&mdash;how pain|ful mu&s;t be the conflict!&mdash;how great the re&s;olution that enables him to make the fearful &s;acrifice!</P>
<P>The marriage preparations are not be|gun; and, I conjecture, will proceed &s;low|ly. I &s;hall not be the per&s;on to hurry them; I &s;hall regard them with an eye of horror. O, ye immortal powers! that watch over

<P>I TOLD you briefly, in my la&s;t, my dear madam, of my meeting with lady Mary Web&s;ter. I have been to &s;ee her twice or thrice &s;ince. She receives me with cordiality, and &s;eeming friend&s;hip; I &s;ay &s;eeming&mdash;for I am &s;ure &s;he does not love my per&s;on, but knows &s;he may de|pend on my principles. Being unhappy, &s;he &s;tands in need of a friend to con&s;ole her; and is obliged to attach her&s;elf to me, for want of a more de&s;irable one. For my part, I &s;incerely wi&s;h her well; I pity her; I &s;hall do every thing in my power for her benefit; but I cannot &s;ay, I e&s;teem her. When I fir&s;t knew her, I was inclined to love her: acquaintance di&s;covering to me the unamiablene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, I found I could not. While we lived together in France, my di&s;like to her daily increa&s;ed;&mdash; it really made me mi&s;erable; it is a mo&s;t painful thing to hate any body; and, I own
<PB N="173" REF="175">to you, I <HI>almo&s;t</HI> hated her. She had &s;o many mean, malicious, namele&s;s ways of provoking, that had I not de&s;pi&s;ed her, and re&s;pected her mother, &s;o much as I did, I &s;hould have found it very difficult to have con&s;tantly kept guard over a temper, &s;o impatient of affront as mine naturally is. We parted with great civility on both &s;ides: but, I confe&s;s, I carried away a &s;en&s;e of her injurious treatment. I am not revengeful; which I owe rather to education and princi|ple, than to nature. I never return an in|jury, but I feel it &s;trongly, and rarely for|give it, till the per&s;on is in &s;ome &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s, or that I have done them a kind|ne&s;s, which I catch at an opportunity of doing, with more eagerne&s;s than I &s;hould exert in favour of one who had done me neither good nor harm. When lady En|more propo&s;ed to adopt me for her daugh|ter, and to &s;ettle her fortune on me, in prejudice to lady Mary, all my little ani|mo&s;ities again&s;t her died within my brea&s;t; I felt my&s;elf intere&s;ted in her welfare; I pleaded for her as I &s;hould have done for a friend. Since the recommencement of our
<PB N="174" REF="176">acquaintance in England, I find her in di&s;|tre&s;s, which excites my pity, and con&s;e|quently &s;trengthens my de&s;ire of being &s;er|viceable to her. She &s;eems heartily to repent her ra&s;hne&s;s; and complains in general of Mr. Web&s;ter's behaviour to her. She par|ticularly re&s;ents his not giving way to her de&s;ire of living in Ireland. <Q>I have no friends in England,</Q> &s;aid &s;he to me, <Q>and very few acquaintances, except &s;ome that are wor&s;e than none.</Q></P>
<P>A lady below to wait on me&mdash;.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>It was lady Mary: &s;he is ju&s;t gone. I have not yet recovered my &s;urprize. I mu&s;t give you our conference. &mdash;Ob&s;erving &s;he was very melancholy, I chid her in a tender manner, for indulging low &s;pirits. "I cannot help it&mdash;I cannot help it," &s;aid &s;he, &s;triking her hand, with &s;ome degree of violence, again&s;t the arm of the &s;ofa on which &s;he leaned.</P>
<P>"Come, come, my friend," cried I, <Q>be wi&s;e; at lea&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent: you
<PB N="175" REF="177">thought too little before marriage; don't think too much after.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Too little, indeed! I was infatuated! Would that pa&s;t time could be recalled! &mdash;ha&s;ty actions retrieved!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why will you torment your&s;elf, by vainly wi&s;hing for impo&s;&s;ibilities? Con|&s;ult your good &s;en&s;e, and you will find, that when an evil is without remedy, we have nothing to do, but to endeavour to bear it in the be&s;t manner we are able.</Q></P>
<P><Q>True; but there are &s;ome things not to be borne:&mdash;ingratitude, for in&s;tance. Did I &s;acrifice my fortune and my friends</Q> &mdash;&s;ure, &s;he might have added, her duty&mdash; "only to be a &s;lave?"</P>
<P><Q>Ah! my dear, your pride is ill-timed. Our &s;ex was not born to rule. While we are in a &s;ingle &s;tate, we may take &s;ome airs on us; but when we are mar|ried, we can have no degree of merit, without meekne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Heavens! do I hear this &s;lavi&s;h maxim from the lips of my &s;pirited countrywo|man? &mdash;But you are not married.</Q></P>

<Q>If being married, I &s;hould act in oppo|&s;ition to this &s;lavi&s;h maxim, as you call it, I &s;hould be wrong, even in my own opinion; and, con&s;equently, my example ought not to be followed.</Q></P>
<P>She was &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes; and then, as if unable to contain her re&s;entment any longer, cried, <Q>Could you &s;ubmit to coldne&s;s, &s;lights, and in&s;ults? Could you bear to vi&s;it, and be ince&s;&s;antly vi|&s;ited by a rival?</Q></P>
<P><Q>O, lady Mary, be cautious of giving way to jealou&s;y;&mdash;that cruel, de&s;tructive, &s;elf-deluding pa&s;&s;ion. I know, at this moment, &s;uch an in&s;tance of its deadly effects, as, were I at liberty to divulge to you, would oblige you to drive the fell intruder from your brea&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Hear me, Mi&s;s O'Bryen, only hear me, and judge if I have not cau&s;e for my &s;u&s;picions. About ten days ago, Mr. Web&s;ter brought a lady Conway and Mi&s;s Orm&s;by to pay their re&s;pects to me. He told me they were daughters to a great merchant of this city, to whom he had been formerly apprenticed, but had
<PB N="177" REF="179">quitted, on an uncle bequeathing him a fortune that &s;et him above trade: a for|tune, by the way, of which I don't be|lieve he has at pre&s;ent a &s;ingle &s;hilling. I did not decline an acquaintance with the&s;e ladies; but he obliged me to re|turn their vi&s;it &s;ooner than I intended. Lady Conway has &s;ince been twice at my hou&s;e; and her &s;i&s;ter very frequently, though I never invite nor welcome her; but, on the contrary, treat her with as much coldne&s;s, as it is po&s;&s;ible to &s;hew without being downright rude. She comes in the morning;&mdash;Web&s;ter a&s;ks her to &s;pend the day;&mdash;I &s;ay nothing;&mdash; yet &s;he &s;tays. Then, their mutual looks, their whole behaviour, their very words&mdash;</Q>.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, as expecting I &s;hould &s;peak. &mdash;It was totally beyond my power. &mdash;She went on.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>My woman tells me there was a &s;trong attachment between my hu&s;band and Mi&s;s Orm&s;by; and that &s;ome improper &mdash;(&s;he believes not ab&s;olutely criminal)&mdash; familiarities had pa&s;&s;ed between them;
<PB N="178" REF="180">which being di&s;covered by the father, Mi&s;s was &s;ent away to a &s;i&s;ter of her mo|ther's, who is married to a clergyman, that lives near a hundred miles from London, and her lover compelled to leave the hou&s;e. His uncle dying &s;ome little time after, he made propo&s;als for her, and was refu&s;ed by her father. Six months ago, my evil genius led him to Paris; and not till then was his mi&s;tre&s;s permitted to return home.</Q></P>
<P>I had now collected my &s;cattered &s;pirits. &mdash;"And how," demanded I, <Q>could your woman come by &s;uch particular informa|tion of tran&s;actions, which, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, were kept very &s;ecret?</Q></P>
<P><Q>She has a cou&s;in that waits on Mrs. Orm&s;by, and is much in her confidence.</Q></P>

I beg your lady&s;hip's pardon for my freedom; but I am too much your friend to flatter you in this pernicious error. Con&s;ider, the &s;tory may have no other foundation, than the malice of Mrs. Orm&s;by's maid: perhaps the young lady has di&s;obliged her, and &s;he takes this method of being revenged; or po&s;&s;ibly the whole has been fabricated by your own &s;ervant, in order to make her&s;elf of con&s;equence to you.</Q></P>
<P>"P&s;haw!" &s;aid &s;he peevi&s;hly, <Q>indeed, indeed, Valeria, you cannot think your|&s;elf as you would have me do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Why, my dear lady Mary, if the&s;e young people had a liking for each other, what could have prevented their marry|ing, when Mr. Web&s;ter had a compe|tent independant fortune?</Q></P>
<P>"Orm&s;by would not give his con&s;ent," &s;he an&s;wered.</P>
<P>"However," &s;aid I, <Q>his di&s;approba|tion mu&s;t have been the only ob&s;tacle to
<PB N="180" REF="182">their union; and if &s;uch a powerful temptation could not induce his daugh|ter to break through her duty to him, can you &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would be guilty of the far greater crime, of endeavouring to en&s;nare the affections of a married man?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But why &s;hould you think he ever a&s;ked her to marry him again&s;t her fa|ther's con&s;ent? I dare &s;ay he would not have taken her without a fortune. I know you will catch at this, as a proof of his not loving her; but it proves no more to me, than that his pa&s;&s;ion was not a generous one.</Q></P>
<P>You may be in the right, thought I: it is probable enough he would not marry the woman he liked, without money; &s;ince he married one he could not like, for the &s;ake of it.</P>
<P>Here a pau&s;e of &s;everal minutes en&s;ued; during which &s;he looked on me with unealy earne&s;tne&s;s; and I &s;at in a po&s;ture of me|lancholy attention&mdash;my thoughts, I own to you, extremely di&s;tuibed: alas! I need not &s;ay why they were &s;o. My God! thought I, is the amiable Marchmont de&s;tined to an
<PB N="181" REF="183">union with &s;uch an infamous coquette?&mdash; The cruel, the ungenerous reflection, was condemned as &s;oon as formed. I blamed my&s;elf, for &s;uffering my opinion of a &s;tran|ger to be influenced by one I knew to be prejudiced. Slight is the foundation on which a jealous temper can build &s;u&s;picion: &mdash;has not the &s;potle&s;s purity of Harriet Wentworth been &s;u&s;pected? I dare not, do not doubt that Mi&s;s Orm&s;by is perfectly innocent. I felt my mind expand beyond the narrowne&s;s of partiality: my con&s;cious heart was elated with hone&s;t triumph&mdash;not over lady Mary&mdash;but over my own way|ward pa&s;&s;ions. 'Tis mean to glory in our &s;uperiority over others,&mdash;great to overcome our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I exerted all the &s;trength of rea&s;oning I am mi&s;tre&s;s of, to argue her lady&s;hip out of her unwarrantable jealou&s;y:&mdash;my endea|vours were quite fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>"You talk very plau&s;ibly," &s;aid &s;he; <Q>but while I have &s;o much rea&s;on to think as I do, it is not in my power to think otherwi&s;e. Wherefore am I detained in England &s;o much again&s;t my inclination?
<PB N="182" REF="184">He drew me here at fir&s;t, on the thin|&s;pun pretence, that his affairs required his pre&s;ence. I did not then a&s;k what the&s;e affairs were; and if I now enquire, receive only the mo&s;t eva&s;ive an&s;wers.</Q></P>
<P>We were here interrupted by the entrance of lady Lucy Domville.</P>
<P>Now, my dear aunt, are you not &s;ur|prized to find lady Mary tru&s;ting the for|merly hated and envied Valeria with a &s;ecret, of a nature &s;o mortifying to her&s;elf? I am convinced &s;he did not come to me with that intention; but being accidentally led into the &s;ubject, was incapable of re|&s;training the impetuo&s;ity of her temper. She has treated me with the confidence of a friend, however, let her motives for it be what they will; and I mu&s;t endeavour to re|turn it by the good offices of one. I &s;hall go to her to-morrow, on purpo&s;e to give her the be&s;t advice in my power. I am apprehen|&s;ive &s;he will be &s;o unguarded as to &s;ay &s;ome|thing to provoke her hu&s;band; an impru|dence which cannot but have di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. I &s;hall &s;trive to make her believe, the behaviour &s;he thinks &s;o repre|hen&s;ible,
<PB N="183" REF="185">is only the effect of a friend&s;hip contracted in younger years; or, at mo&s;t, of a tenderer pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided into friend|&s;hip. This is my own opinion of the mat|ter: were I to form any other, I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf wanting in candour and ge|nero&s;ity. The mo&s;t innocent are frequently the mo&s;t liable to the malevolence of &s;lan|der: &s;en&s;ible of the rectitude of their inten|tions, they dream not of becoming the ob|jects of cen&s;ure, and con&s;equently take no pains to guard again&s;t it. Prudence, with regard to this world, is perhaps a more ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification than virtue it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Although I have already &s;welled this let|ter to an enormous &s;ize, I cannot clo&s;e it without informing you, I had the honour to plea&s;e the duke of Granville's eye the other night, at a play. He prote&s;ted, with great warmth, I was the mo&s;t perfect beauty he had ever beheld; with a good deal more, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Dean Domville, lord Linfield's younge&s;t brother, who is very well acquainted with the duke, happened to be be&s;ide him, and &s;aid plea&s;antly, <Q>If I could introduce your grace to that
<PB N="184" REF="186">young lady, might I reckon upon your intere&s;t for the fir&s;t vacant bi&s;hoprick?</Q> He a&s;ked my name; and upon being told, repeated it twice, with eagerne&s;s and emo|tion. <Q>Pray, &s;ir, do you know her fa|mily?</Q> The dean replied, that he did not; but told him I was an Iri&s;hwoman: upon which he a&s;ked no more que&s;tions; but appeared remarkably re&s;erved and thoughtful for the re&s;t of the evening; fre|quently looking on me with earne&s;tne&s;s, but drawing off his eyes, and affecting to ap|pear unconcerned, when he thought him&s;elf ob&s;erved by the dean, who was extremely puzzled to what motive to impute a beha|viour that &s;eemed to him &s;o &s;trange. From pure curio&s;ity, he came to lord Linfield's the next morning; gave the above recital to lady Lucy, and made &s;ome enquiries about me. She explained the my&s;tery to him; and he very kindly offered his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to reconcile me to his grace. I wi&s;h much to be on terms of friend&s;hip with &s;o near a relation; but I &s;hall not &s;toop to any mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to bring it about. I have never done any thing to di&s;oblige him. My
<PB N="185" REF="187">mother married without his con&s;ent; but &s;he married a gentleman&mdash;a man of honour, of family; one who was&mdash;nearly, at lea&s;t&mdash; her equal. The fault, if it becomes me to call it one in her, did by no means ju&s;tify his &s;everity to her; and even if it did, I am not in any degree an&s;werable for it. The truth is, I think he ought rather to &s;eek me, than I him: yet I &s;hall be contented to pay him this compliment, as he is my mother's father; but tru&s;t me, I &s;hall not forget I am the haughty Sir William O'Bryen's daughter. With all this pride, you will believe I have no great chance of &s;ucceeding with this proud nobleman: the affair is not of much con&s;equence, how|ever. I have great rea&s;on to be thankful that it is not on him I am dependant; but on tho&s;e, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ju&s;t degree of &s;pirit them&s;elves, know how to forgive even an exuberance of it in another. I ought to be pardoned for being proud, be|cau&s;e I am poor;&mdash;rich people are without excu&s;e: affluence &s;hould give humility;&mdash; but poverty elevates the well-born &s;oul! I feel I &s;hould be much le&s;s lofty, if I was
<PB N="186" REF="188">rich&mdash;<HI>apropos</HI> to rich&mdash;Mr. Domville tells me, he has my uncle's orders to accommo|date me with what money I may want. I have no occa&s;ion for any at pre&s;ent: I have always three times as much as I know what to do with. I am re&s;olved I will not be extravagant, if I can help it, though my uncle does all he can to &s;poil me. 'Tis not ea&s;y for me here to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, as neither his, nor your deli|cate genero&s;ity will allow me to make u&s;e of. My be&s;t friends, I do not wi&s;h my obligations to you cancelled; it is impo&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould ever be &s;o; but I pray that they may be paid by the <Q>Giver of all good things!</Q>&mdash;Infinite Bounty only can pay them for</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;een her! the happy Orm&s;by! lady Mary's rival. Ah! is &s;he no other per&s;on's rival?&mdash;"Down ri&s;ing mi&s;chief!"</P>
<P>I found lady Mary a little indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;he did not &s;ee company; I &s;ent up my name, however, and was admitted. We had near half an hour's conver&s;ation on the la&s;t &s;ubject: her jealou&s;y is too deeply rooted, for me to be able to pluck it up; but I hope my coun&s;el&mdash;to which &s;he &s;eems to pay a de|ference&mdash;will a&s;&s;i&s;t her to conduct her&s;elf with prudence: yet when I con&s;ider her ira&s;cible temper, and the mad pa&s;&s;ion that wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her mind, I cannot help fearing &s;he will &s;ay or do &s;omething extra|vagant.&mdash;I thought it expedient to inform her Mi&s;s Orm&s;by was on the point of being married;&mdash;I would not tell her to whom.</P>
<P>While I &s;taid with her, her &s;ervant en|tered; <Q>Mi&s;s Orm&s;by is below &s;tairs, my lady; and begs to know if&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190">
<Q>Impertinent animal! Did not I tell you, I would not &s;ee any body?</Q></P>
<P>"I told her &s;o, madam; but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Be gone&mdash;I will not&mdash;"</P>
<P><Q>Give your lady's compliments to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>and tell her &s;he will be glad to &s;ee her?</Q></P>
<P>The woman looked doubtful; I nodded toward the door; an imperial nod, I &s;up|po&s;e,&mdash;&s;he left the room immediately. I apologized for the liberty I had taken; and convinced her lady&s;hip it would have been in all re&s;pects improper to have refu&s;ed the vi&s;it.&mdash;With &s;hame I confe&s;s to you, my indulgent friend, the vi&s;it was little le&s;s painful to me than to her. My heart beat as Mi&s;s Orm&s;by came up &s;tairs,&mdash;'twas a certain malicious &s;ort of beating, that I cannot de&s;cribe. I felt a kind of predeter|mination to hate her:&mdash;the impul&s;e was involuntary; as &s;uch, I hope it was not quite unpardonable: it was attended with exqui&s;ite pain; may that atone for it!&mdash;I am convinced we can be happy only in proportion as we are good: we &s;hould cul|tivate benevolent di&s;po&s;itions in our own
<PB N="189" REF="191">defence:&mdash;if hatred, envy&mdash;any evil pa&s;|&s;ion &mdash;does but glance upon my mind, it di&s;turbs my internal peace. I &s;hall remem|ber this; and henceforth, when any per|&s;on does me an injury, I &s;hall forgive them on account of the mi&s;ery their own malig|nity occa&s;ions them.</P>
<P>You will expect me to &s;ay &s;omething of Mi&s;s Orm&s;by.&mdash;She is a fine girl: tall, well made, and genteel; very fair, her fea|tures hand&s;ome; a &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty in her looks and behaviour, that &s;ufficiently refute the black charge again&s;t her. But, indeed, that charge &s;carce needs any other refutation than its improbability: can the woman who is honoured by the addre&s;&s;es of &s;uch a man as Marchmont, throw away a thought on any other of his &s;ex? Impo&s;&s;i|ble! impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Web&s;ter is hand&s;ome&mdash; nay, very hand&s;ome; lively, yet tender and in&s;inuating; apparently good-humoured; has an inexhau&s;tible fund of chit-chat:&mdash; but Sir Edward&mdash;ah! I cannot bear the compari&s;on;&mdash;Sir Edward is a being of a &s;uperior order.</P>

Adieu; my woman tells me I have not half an hour to dre&s;s for dinner.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>It would be more fit for me to go to bed after one o'clock in the morning, than to &s;it down to &s;cribble; but my mind is not &s;ufficiently at ea&s;e to allow me to &s;leep: the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing incident&mdash;but I need not enter into particulars.&mdash;Poor Hamilton!

<L>"And all that I inflict, endure."</L></Q>
<P>What a painful thing it is, to give pain! And yet, madam, how many of our &s;ex are there, who make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, to excite wi&s;hes they never mean to gratify? The cen&s;ure, indeed, mu&s;t not &s;olely fall on us,&mdash;the men are equally cul|pable: each &s;ex delights to en&s;nare the other. Such, O vanity! is thy power over
<PB N="191" REF="193">the mind, that many a young per&s;on, who would &s;hed tears of unfeigned compa&s;&s;ion over a di&s;tre&s;s, far inferior to the pangs of &s;lighted love, &s;acrifices, without compunc|tion, the peace of a fellow-creature, to the trifling, contemptible plea&s;ure of being ad|mired. How cruel and ba&s;e it is, to inflict the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h, the &s;en&s;ible heart is capable of feeling, only to procure a very worthle&s;s and unwarrantable gratifica|tion! &mdash;Coquetry is &s;o common a vice, we are not apt to look on it with the dete&s;ta|tion it de&s;erves; but a crime lo&s;es nothing of its original nature by becoming general; let guilt be divided and &s;ubdivided ten thou&s;and, thou&s;and times, its &s;pecific pro|perties will &s;till be contained within the por|tion of each individual.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;peak of coquetry, without thinking of poor lady Mary Web&s;ter;&mdash; would not one have imagined, that nature had effectually &s;ecured &s;uch a piece of &s;tu|died deformity, from the influence of va|nity? No &s;uch thing;&mdash;&s;he was determined to be thought hand&s;ome, in &s;pite of na|ture, let her looking-gla&s;s contradict her as
<PB N="192" REF="194">much as it plea&s;ed. It is none of the lea&s;t pernicious attributes of vanity, that &s;he is continually mi&s;leading her &s;en&s;ele&s;s votaries, to &s;eek applau&s;e where they are wor&s;t qua|lified to obtain it: lady Mary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a genius, which, had &s;he cultivated, would have given her a rational claim to admira|tion; but &s;he preferred the mere &s;emblance of beauty, to the reality of under&s;tanding; and art was called in, to &s;upply the par&s;i|mony of nature with inefficacious profu&s;ion. But dearly has &s;he paid for her ill-judged choice: health, the fir&s;t of earthly ble&s;|&s;ings, was the price of a complexion alone. That abominable paint has hurt her con|&s;titution extremely. Strange it is, that any body in their &s;en&s;es &s;hould barter health, even for real beauty!&mdash;Lady Enmore had apprehen&s;ions of her being con&s;umptive, before I left Paris; and very rationally im|puted it to her u&s;e of paint; which, how|ever, &s;he could not prevail on her to lay a&s;ide. I fear the continuance of this de|&s;tructive practice, joined to the pre&s;ent in|quietude of her mind, may have very bad effects. Probably &s;he dares not now ap|pear
<PB N="193" REF="195">in her natural <HI>colours</HI>&mdash;excu&s;e a pun&mdash; for fear of di&s;gu&s;ting her hu&s;band: yet, were I a man and a hu&s;band, I &s;hould think paint more di&s;agreeable, than the mo&s;t tawny &s;kin Africa's &s;un ever &s;hone on.</P>
<P>After &s;aying &s;o much again&s;t artificial complexions, it behoves me not to lay my|&s;elf open to the temptation of u&s;ing one, by keeping &s;uch bad hours.</P>

You don't blame me&mdash;you allow me to complain&mdash;you don't expect me to conquer my unhappy love immediately.

<P>I will fly to you:&mdash;my heart will not know peace, till it repo&s;es it&s;elf on your affec|tionate bo&s;om. I told lady Lucy you in|tended &s;ending my uncle for me; where|upon &s;he very obligingly limited her &s;tay here to a fortnight. I wi&s;h the time was &s;horter. I would not be in this kingdom,

<P>I had an interview with the duke of Granville this morning: thus it happened &mdash;Lady Linfield and I went to &s;ee Mrs. Domville: on entering the drawing-room, we found only her, the dean, and a hand|&s;ome, maje&s;tic looking old gentleman. The dean aro&s;e from his &s;eat with alacrity, and taking hold of my hand, <Q>Come, Mi&s;s O'Bryen, you will plead your cau&s;e more &s;ucce&s;sfully your&s;elf than I can do. The
<PB N="196" REF="198">duke of Granville, madam,</Q> leading me up to him.</P>
<P>I knelt:&mdash;<Q>It was the dying com|mand of the be&s;t of mothers, that if I ever had the honour to &s;ee your grace, I &s;hould thus intreat you&mdash;not to cur&s;e her memory.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eemed much agitated and &s;urprized at this uncommon addre&s;s, and remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time; then a&s;&s;uming a &s;tern a&s;pect,&mdash;"Ri&s;e," cried he, without even pre|&s;enting his hand to rai&s;e me; <Q>your mo|ther was the mo&s;t ungrateful&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tarted up:&mdash;<Q>Hold, my lord; you &s;hall not abu&s;e my mother.</Q></P>
<P>"She was devoid of gratitude," &s;aid he, fiercely; <Q>&s;he was devoid of duty. I re|nounced her, and I renounce her daugh|ter.</Q></P>
<P>I bowed my head re&s;pectfully, as acqui|e&s;cing in his determination; and tears filled my eyes, in &s;pite of my endeavours to &s;up|pre&s;s them. Mrs. Domville, who is one of the &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t natured women in the world, embraced me, and wept.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199">
"The duke of Granville," &s;aid lady Linfield warmly, <Q>is the only man in the kingdom that would not be happy to call Mi&s;s O'Bryen his relation.</Q></P>
<P>The dean, in a re&s;olute tone, &s;aid, <Q>My lord, I &s;hould con&s;ider my&s;elf unworthy of the &s;acred character I bear, if I neg|lected to&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The duke did not care to hear a remon|&s;trance that opened &s;o formidably; and in|terrupted it by addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P><Q>I do not mean to treat you with rude|ne&s;s, young lady: neverthele&s;s I mu&s;t tell you plainly, that I am determined never to admit into my family, a per&s;on that bears the name of O'Bryen.</Q></P>
<P>This in&s;ult rou&s;ed all my father's &s;pirit: &mdash;"And yet, my lord," an&s;wered I, <Q>it is a name that will always confer honour on the per&s;on that bears it: and I boa&s;t le&s;s of the Sedley, than the O'Bryen blood!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Though I don't look on you as my re|lation,</Q> rejoined he, <Q>I &s;hall be your friend. Dean Domville has told me in what circum&s;tances your father has left
<PB N="198" REF="200">you: I &s;hall take care to make a genteel provi&s;ion for you.</Q></P>
<P>My pride was inconceivably rai&s;ed; and I haughtily &s;aid, <Q>I am &s;orry your grace thought proper to make me &s;uch an of|fer, in a manner that puts it out of my power to thank you. Do not think, my lord, that I inherit as little of Sir William O'Bryen's pride, as of his for|tune. I derive from him a &s;pirit&mdash;equal to your own; and will never conde&s;cend to receive obligations from tho&s;e who treat me with contempt. I &s;ought your friend&s;hip only;&mdash;you deny me that:&mdash; I di&s;dain your wealth. I had no merce|nary views: I could have none; for my father, with his la&s;t breath, conjured me never to accept any thing from you; and the utmo&s;t degree of indigence could not tempt me to break his command. Nor do I need your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: I have an un|cle, on whom I depend with the &s;ame ea&s;e and confidence, I &s;hould do on a father; who &s;upports me, not only in affluence, but &s;plendour. And, give me leave to inform your grace, I &s;hould ne|ver
<PB N="199" REF="201">have made my&s;elf known to you, if I had not been &s;o circum&s;tanced, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;interpret my motives.</Q> I curt&s;ied, and left the room, with an air (lady Linfield was plea&s;ed to call) grace|fully maje&s;tic. Both the ladies followed me into another room, where we pre&s;ently took leave of Mrs. Domville, and returned home.</P>
<P>I know my uncle will be plea&s;ed with his girl's boldne&s;s on this occa&s;ion: and, though you are not &s;o proud as either he or I, I think you will not di&s;approve it. Perhaps I ought to have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome gratitude for the provi&s;ion his grace would have made for me; but, I own, I was more hurt than obliged by his intention. I have been almo&s;t four years &s;upported by friend|&s;hip; &mdash;but I have not yet learned to give thanks for charity!</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry to tell you&mdash;deuce take this cant!&mdash;no, I am neither glad nor &s;orry to tell you, that Sir John O'Bryen has de|parted this life.</P>
<P>"Truly, &s;ir," you'll &s;ay, <Q>a very feel|ing and polite manner of informing me of the death of &s;o near a relation!</Q></P>
<P>Come, my dear, no affectation. I know you never loved him; nor had you ever any rea&s;on: indeed, very few people had.&mdash; He lived unloved, and died unlamented. Your father&mdash;pardon me, Valeria&mdash;your father was a libertine; yet he was loved and re&s;pected, and de&s;erved to be &s;o. He had a &s;oul!&mdash;Sir John had none! One would not be &s;o uncharitable as to &s;ay, he has probably by this time found out, to his co&s;t, that he had one. Of all &s;inners, I take a mi&s;er to be the farthe&s;t out of the road to Heaven. Avarice is the wor&s;t of vices &mdash;the mo&s;t incompatible with any degree
<PB N="203" REF="205">of virtue: it blunts all the finer feelings; de&s;troys every great and generous principle; &s;tifles the &s;ocial di&s;po&s;itions that bind man to man; &s;ours the temper; and narrows the heart. In compari&s;on with avarice, I could call other vices the pardonable effects of human frailty; but the mi&s;er breaks that grand law of benevolence, which was ori|ginally written by God's own finger on his heart.</P>
<P>Francis O'Bryen&mdash;I beg his pardon&mdash;<HI>Sir</HI> Francis O'Bryen is come home. He has apparently profited well by the liberal edu|cation he has received, and acquired a knowledge of the world without being cor|rupted by it. It is with &s;ingular plea&s;ure my Caroline &s;ees this only &s;urviving male of her illu&s;trious family, &s;o well qualified to &s;upport the dignity of his hou&s;e. His fa|ther has left him a fortune not unworthy of his name: this, without doubt, will be a great advantage to him; but had he been of a different character, it could have been none. The &s;un&s;hine of wealth only &s;erves to di&s;play a man's virtues, and expo&s;e his vices, to a larger number of beholders;&mdash;
<PB N="204" REF="206">it may dazzle the view of fools, but the &s;teady eye of rea&s;on ea&s;ily penetrates the fal&s;e glare. How often have I lamented the folly and &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s of tho&s;e men, whom I have &s;een heaping up riches for their children, while they denied them &s;uch an education as would have enabled them to become a fortune! How cruel it is to &s;uffer a youth to grow up in ignorance&mdash; perhaps in vice too&mdash;and then place him in a con&s;picuous point of view, that all the world may perceive his defects! For my part, I think grandeur becomes a clown as ill as a fine &s;uit of cloaths would a monkey.</P>
<P>But all this time, I tell you nothing of your legacy:&mdash;five hundred pounds! I refu&s;ed this pitiful beque&s;t for you, as proudly as you could have done your&s;elf. Sir Francis &s;aid, it was a mi&s;take; that the &s;um ought&mdash;you ob&s;erve the equivocating <HI>ought</HI>&mdash;to have been five <HI>thou&s;and</HI> pounds, which he would pay into my hands imme|diately; and begged I would keep the er|ror of the will a &s;ecret. I was plea&s;ed with his genero&s;ity, and &s;till more with the manner of it: but I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to
<PB N="205" REF="207">deceive you; and a&s;&s;ured him, that your delicacy would not permit you to receive &s;uch an obligation from &s;o young a man. He was much chagrined and di&s;&s;atisfied at my refu&s;al:&mdash;&s;aid, he did not know how to offer you <HI>money</HI> him&s;elf; but he hoped there would be no impropriety in his intreating you to accept &s;ome jewels. He mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e I thought meanly of him, if I did not prevail on you to take them. He owed you &s;ome reparation for the injury his father had done your's. I ob&s;erved, that though Sir John had undoubtedly hurt his brother, it was only by exacting a ju&s;t debt.</P>
<P>"A ju&s;t debt Sir!" replied the &s;pirited youth; <Q>there may be debts, which the law calls ju&s;t, that no man of honour would exact.</Q></P>
<P>This indirect cen&s;ure on Sir John, is the only one 1 ever heard him pronounce: on the contrary, he treats his memory with great re&s;pect, though he neither is&mdash;nor affects to appear&mdash;much afflicted. But as to lady O'Bryen, her grief hardly knows any bounds. God forgive me, for &s;u&s;pect|ing her of a little hypocri&s;y. Yet, perhaps,
<PB N="206" REF="208">I wrong her:&mdash;when a tender connexion is broken, the memory retains and exagge|rates all the advantages and plea&s;ures of it; and the anxieties are totally forgotten. Many a per&s;on, I believe, has unaffectedly wept for a relation they would not wi&s;h to recall to life.</P>
<P>Sir Francis has brought a friend with him from Italy. He is a Frenchman; but has none of that vivacity, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to characteri&s;e his nation: he rather &s;uits our ideas of the Spaniards; &mdash;grave, &s;tately, and re&s;erved. Is it not &s;omething &s;urpriz|ing, that O'Bryen, who&s;e temper is warm, frank, and &s;prightly, &s;hould chu&s;e a man of &s;o oppo&s;ite a character for his bo&s;om friend? It would be hard to tell by what &s;ympathy they are &s;o clo&s;ely united. The chevalier du Mornai has a fine under&s;tand|ing; has thought, read, and &s;een a great deal: but the qualities of the heart are more nece&s;&s;ary to excite and pre&s;erve affec|tion, than tho&s;e of the head. I know, however, I am too apt to judge&mdash;though I am &s;eldom mi&s;taken in judging&mdash;of the in|terior by the exterior. The coldne&s;s of du
<PB N="207" REF="209">Mornai's manners, is perhaps the re&s;ult of misfortunes: if &s;o, his re&s;erved behaviour does not di&s;qualify him for friend&s;hip, though it mu&s;t prove an ob&s;tacle to his forming it.</P>
<P>May I a&s;k you, my &s;weet girl, what is the meaning your aunt does not &s;hew me your letters, as &s;he u&s;ed to do; but only reads me pa&s;&s;ages here and there? And I ob&s;erve, neither the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, nor the let|ters you write to me, are dictated by your u&s;ual &s;prightline&s;s. Ah! Valeria, I &s;u&s;|pect &mdash;How often have I told you, that the little deity would, &s;ome time or other, claim his rightful &s;overeignty over your re|bellious heart? But why may not I be tru&s;ted as well as Mrs. Chetwynd? Believe me, &s;he cannot be more tenderly intere&s;ted in any thing that concerns you than I am. I do not recommend my &s;ex in general to the confidence of your's: &mdash;men, to &s;ay the truth, are rough, gro&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ible crea|ture; but I am willing to think, that your conver&s;ation, and &s;o many years pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety of my Caroline, mu&s;t have po|li&s;hed my manners, and &s;oftened my heart.
<PB N="208" REF="210">Sure, my love, you are not afraid of my raillery. If I have joked with you upon this or that admirer, 'twas only becau&s;e I knew you were indifferent to them. I do love to be merry my&s;elf, and to make others &s;o; but never at the expence of any one's feelings:&mdash;when a je&s;t becomes ill|natured, it is no longer a je&s;t to me. My deare&s;t Valeria, if you will admit me into your confidence, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as the highe&s;t proof you can give me of your friend&s;hip;&mdash;perhaps, too, it may be &s;ome way in my power to &s;erve you: &mdash;but if you chu&s;e to exclude me, you have nothing to do but to pa&s;s over this part of my letter without notice. I &s;hall not think I have a &s;hadow of right to be offended; &mdash;I &s;hall acquie&s;ce in &s;ilence;&mdash;I &s;hall be convinced you are actuated in this ca&s;e, as in every other, by the be&s;t and propere&s;t motives. Nor need you fear that I will endeavour to find out any thing from your aunt. I never expect, nor wi&s;h, <HI>my</HI> friends to betray <HI>theirs</HI> to me,</P>
<P>When may we expect to fee you? I have no patience with the dilatorine&s;s of the&s;e Domvilles.</P>

Other men may tell you what they will, Valeria; but, po&s;itively, your complexion is &s;o far from di&s;gracing the lily or the ro&s;e, &mdash;your breath &s;o little &s;teals their &s;weets,&mdash; that my flowers blow not half &s;o fair in your ab&s;ence.

<P>I WANTED to &s;peak to you, Han|nah, and intended to call at my father's this morning for that purpo&s;e:&mdash;am prevented, and therefore <HI>take this method of informing you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I abhor the part of a cen&s;or, but &s;hall act it for your benefit.&mdash;You are wretchedly imprudent to &s;uffer your pa&s;&s;ion for that Web&s;ter to tran&s;port you thus beyond the bounds of decorum. Don't laugh, child, at <HI>my</HI> preaching up decorum; I may do things that won't fuit you:&mdash;my man is noo&s;ed&mdash;your's free:&mdash;freer, perhaps, than you think.

<P>IN what a &s;tile do you write to me, Emily! You are the la&s;t per&s;on on earth from whom I expected &s;uch a lecture. Surely, &s;ome people think the folly of others brings an acce&s;&s;ion of wi&s;dom to them&s;elves.</P>

<P>You need be under no fear of my lo&s;ing my <HI>intended.</HI> This very morning our wedding was fixed for next week.</P>
<P>You accu&s;e me of deceiving Sir Edward. &mdash;What! you a coquette, and di&s;allow a little nece&s;&s;ary hypocri&s;y! Believe me, however, the tenderne&s;s I manife&s;ted to him, was, at fir&s;t, far from being the effect of artifice. When he vi&s;ited you at Meadow-vale, I
<PB N="216" REF="218">was &s;truck with his beauty, the ea&s;y maje&s;|ty of his fine per&s;on, his poli&s;hed manners, his wit, his vivacity, and perhaps, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with his rank. Re&s;entment of Mr. Web&s;ter's cruelty, bade my heart &s;eek a kinder ma&s;ter. The apprehen&s;ion that my unhappy, guilty connexion with him, though known only to our&s;elves and you, might by &s;ome unfore&s;een means become public, induced me to &s;eek a &s;helter in ma|trimony. Sir Edward's charms&mdash;rendered more con&s;picuous by his extreme &s;uperiority to your other vi&s;itors&mdash;pointed him out to my choice. I endeavoured to plea&s;e him&mdash;&s;uc|ceeded &mdash;and was delighted with my con|que&s;t. I determined to bani&s;h his rival from my mind, and give him the preference he de&s;erved: the&s;e were my &s;entiments when he left us. His tedious vi&s;it to his old-fa&s;hioned &s;i&s;ter, his ill-timed excur&s;ion to lord Methuen's &s;eat, his coldly polite an|&s;wer to your letter, his unnece&s;&s;arily and unaccountably delaying to declare him&s;elf to my father,&mdash;all con&s;pired to &s;tifle the new|born flame, when the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of my affections returned to claim them. He
<PB N="217" REF="219">&s;wore that he loved me with unabated ar|dour &mdash;that nothing but the fear of bringing me into di&s;tre&s;s could have prevented his marrying me&mdash;and that nece&s;&s;ity, alone, had compelled him to give his hand to a woman, who was not only indifferent, but di&s;agreeable to him. He be&s;ought me to vi&s;it her,&mdash;I had long forgotten how to de|ny him any thing,&mdash;I complied;&mdash;found her below my jealou&s;y; and in&s;en&s;ibly re|&s;umed my fir&s;t &s;entiments for this too en|gaging man. Still, Sir Edward is, as he ever mu&s;t be, the object of my e&s;teem and admiration: there is no man, on who&s;e honour or genero&s;ity I &s;hould &s;o confi|dently rely;&mdash;more than this I cannot grant him; nor does he de&s;erve I &s;hould, for I am well convinced he is not more attached to me, than I am to him. He is very po|lite to me, and even attentive; but it is a forced &s;ort of attention;&mdash;there is an auk|wardne&s;s in his tenderne&s;s, that betrays the affectation of it. To &s;ay the truth, I &s;u&s;|pect him to be pretty much in the &s;ame predicament with my&s;elf,&mdash;videlicet,&mdash;his heart engaged in a wrong place.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220">
This morning, when I mentioned my intended jaunt to Jeph&s;on-lodge, my father de&s;ired I would fir&s;t name the wedding-day; which I did, after &s;ome little he&s;itation.&mdash; Marchmont turned pale as a&s;hes&mdash;bowed, and &s;poke not a word. About a quarter of an hour after, he thanked me, in a con|fu&s;ed manner; and begged to know how long I &s;hould &s;tay in the country. He did not a&s;k to vi&s;it me there&mdash;he did not bid me ha&s;ten my return&mdash;he expre&s;&s;ed no cu|rio&s;ity to know who was to be of my party &mdash;he did not &s;o much as hint a wi&s;h for a nearer day.&mdash;Emily, do you think my heart can melt to &s;uch an icy lover as this?

Really, my friends, I tre&s;|pa&s;s on your genero&s;ity; but I cannot &s;pare you on Thur&s;day&mdash;Thur&s;day? O God!</P>
<P>My angui&s;h deepens as that fatal day ap|proaches. I begin to doubt the principles on which I act. Shall I not do a great and la&s;ting injury to Mi&s;s Orm&s;by, in making her my wife, incapacitated as I am from ever loving her? Ought I not rather to have ingenuou&s;ly acknowledged my unal|terable attachment to another? Yet, how could I do &s;o? Would it have been deli|cate &mdash;honourable? Alas! my error&mdash;my irretrievable&mdash;and, may I &s;ay, my una|voidable error, lay in my incon&s;tancy.&mdash; Incon&s;tancy!&mdash;I wrong my&s;elf. No, Me|thuen,
<PB N="223" REF="225">till I &s;aw that angel, my heart was ignorant of love:&mdash;that dear, that cruel pa&s;&s;ion was totally unknown to me. Infa|tuating pa&s;&s;ion! mi&s;erable as it has made me, I hardly wi&s;h&mdash;don't think me mad&mdash; I hardly wi&s;h it to be extingui&s;hed. A fine writer &s;ays extremely well&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"There is a plea&s;ure, &s;ure,</L>
<L>"In being mad, which none but madmen know."</L></Q>
<P>Yes, in my very pains there is a &s;oft, in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;omething, I could almo&s;t call plea&s;ure. O love! &s;harp and barbed are thy arrows, but they are dipt in &s;mooth oil! With what idly-plea&s;ing dreams does fancy cheat me! A few days more, and this bright flame will be dimmed by guilt. &mdash;Here, here, my friend, is the extreme&s;t malice of my fate. I can never, never cea&s;e to love her: and, O, that I might always love with innocence, although it &s;hould always be without hope!</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>Good Heaven!&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter has this moment received a letter from Mi&s;s
<PB N="224" REF="226">O'Bryen. She is going to Ireland&mdash;I &s;hall never &s;ee her more!</P>
<P>I am afraid Harriet mu&s;t have perceived the agitation with which I received this cruel intelligence.</P>
<P>The letter came from Granville-park, where &s;he is at pre&s;ent. She returns to lord Linfield's in a few days; and from thence will come to Hermitage, to take her final leave of Mrs. Wentworth.</P>
<P>O, Methuen, to lo&s;e even the &s;ight of her for ever!&mdash;But I merit it: I ought to have vi&s;ited her in London. What could &s;he think of my apparent negligence?&mdash;and that, after &s;he had mo&s;t kindly and politely a&s;&s;ured me, my <Q>e&s;teem was e&s;&s;ential to her happine&s;s.</Q>&mdash;The dear creature!</P>
<P>Can I expect &s;he will remember me with friend&s;hip? Ah! no! I &s;hall be&mdash;per|haps I already am&mdash;the forgotten thing I de&s;erve to be. Shortly may &s;ome happier man&mdash;The pen drops from my fingers.</P>
<P>&mdash;</P>
<P>I have &s;pent this evening in &s;traying through the&s;e &s;ilent woods, endeavouring
<PB N="225" REF="227">to rea&s;on down my pa&s;&s;ions. Why do I lament her departure? thought I. Situa|ted as I am, ought I not rather to de&s;ire it? Ju&s;t then, I entered a little arbour;&mdash; here I was once ble&s;t with her &s;ociety! I threw my&s;elf&mdash;or, indeed, I rather fell&mdash;on the verdant turf. I laid my face on the place where &s;he had &s;at; and&mdash;do not de|&s;pi&s;e me, Augu&s;tus&mdash;I wept. After a long time, I rai&s;ed my head, and accidentally ca&s;t my eyes on a &s;hrub, that grew at the back of the gra&s;&s;y &s;eat, who&s;e tender root her friendly care had &s;heltered. I leaned over it with affection:&mdash;it looked droop|ing. "I will refre&s;h you with my tears," &s;aid I;&mdash;<Q>but <HI>her</HI> tears have fallen over you&mdash;how can you ever wither?</Q>&mdash; My &s;i&s;ter, the angelic Valeria, and my&s;elf, were &s;itting in this bower, li&s;tening to the birds, that perched on the branches around us, warbled forth the prai&s;es of that charm|ing &s;ea&s;on, when nature, like the phoenix, ari&s;es with renewed beauty and vigour from her own ruins. Mi&s;s O'Bryen prai&s;ed their wild melody, in words as &s;weet as their own notes. The gentle Harriet's mind
<PB N="226" REF="228">was melted, even beyond its u&s;ual &s;oftne&s;s. With a countenance at once expre&s;&s;ive of re&s;ignation and woe, and a tone that knew its way directly to the heart, &s;he repeated tho&s;e plaintive lines of the melancholy Gray:&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>"To warm their little loves the birds complain,</L>
<L>"I fruitle&s;s mourn to him that cannot hear,</L>
<L>"And weep the more&mdash;becau&s;e I weep in vain!"</L></Q>
<P>Valeria's eyes &s;hone through the trem|bling tears of pity. She turned away her beauteous face;&mdash;"Poor little &s;hrub," &s;aid &s;he, in a low and interrupted voice, <Q>you are expo&s;ed to the weather.</Q> Her white hand gathered up the earth about it. Per|haps her fancy, at that moment, drew a &s;ort of compari&s;on between it and Harriet:&mdash; "and, O, thou fair and pining flower!" thought &s;he, <Q>would that I knew how to reanimate <HI>thee!</HI> or, rather, would that my hand could thus have timely &s;creened thee from the blighting winds of afflic|tion!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="229">
O my loved &s;i&s;ter, how hard has been thy fate! What could have brought down &s;o much wrath on thy innocent head?</P>
<P>When this white lamb has bled on &s;or|row's altar, how &s;hall &s;uch an unworthy victim as I am, dare to murmur?</P>

<HEAD>To the RIGHT HON. LADY METHUEN.&mdash; POPLAR-HILL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>HERMITAGE.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS I know the affectionate part my dear lady Methuen bears in all my &s;orrows, I fly to pour out my full heart to her.&mdash; My brother&mdash;my dear, my amiable Ed|ward &mdash;mu&s;t he be unhappy? This is too much, ye cruel powers! I have hardly a wi&s;h that does not center in him: he &s;up|plies to me all the dear relations I have lo&s;t &mdash;my parents, hu&s;band, brother, all in one! Mu&s;t he, who&s;e &s;tudy and delight is to promote the felicity of all around him&mdash; who&s;e genero&s;ity is the &s;ource of happine&s;s to numbers&mdash;mu&s;t he be mi&s;erable him&s;elf? &mdash;Loui&s;a&mdash;lord Methuen&mdash;I conjure you both, a&s;&s;i&s;t me to extricate him. He &s;hall not marry her: I would go any lengths to prevent it. But what can I do, unac|quainted as I am with the nature of his en|gagements to her? Advi&s;e me; tell me what I &s;hall do; for &s;omething I mu&s;t, and will
<PB N="229" REF="231">do, be it ever &s;o extravagant. I cannot be a pa&s;&s;ive &s;pectator of his wretchedne&s;s. Write to me in&s;tantly, and inform me of all you know: I am certain he would not conceal any thing from my lord or you. &mdash;A too generous a compa&s;&s;ion for my weakne&s;s, is probably the motive of his re&s;erve to me. But if you are not his con|fidante, in how unintelligible a manner am I writing to you!&mdash;Let me explain my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>When my charming young friend, Mi&s;s O'Bryen, honoured my little retirement with her pre&s;ence, I imagined my brother's heart was fully &s;en&s;ible of her uncommon perfections; and I really took great pains to incline her in his favour. I was equally vexed and &s;urprized, when he informed me of his intended alliance with Mi&s;s Orm&s;by; which I thought my&s;elf in honour bound to make known to Mi&s;s O'Bryen. I did &s;o: and reluctantly gave up the plea&s;ing hope of &s;eeing an union between two per|&s;ons I thought eminently calculated for each other:</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="232">
Since he came here la&s;t, I perceived he was far from having his u&s;ual flow of &s;pi|rits; and though it appeared &s;trange enough, that an event which brings joy to others, &s;hould be an occa&s;ion of &s;adne&s;s to him, I was &s;o well convinced that I had been mi&s;taken in his &s;entiments, that I &s;u&s;pected nothing.</P>
<P>I had this morning a letter from Mi&s;s O'Bryen, which informed me, that &s;he was to leave England immediately. I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my concern in lively terms. Ed|ward hardly &s;aid any thing; but his looks were to the la&s;t degree di&s;compo&s;ed; and he left the parlour abruptly.</P>
<P>He did not come down &s;tairs till &s;um|moned to dinner, when he affected to ap|pear chearful, though he &s;carcely eat any thing; and di&s;quiet, and melancholy, were vi&s;ibly marked on his countenance.</P>
<P>I was, much to my regret, obliged to &s;pend the evening abroad.</P>
<P>On my return home, I found him &s;till le&s;s him&s;elf than he had been in the morn|ing. His looks &s;poke neither contentment
<PB N="231" REF="233">nor health: he was ab&s;ent, &s;ilent, and al|mo&s;t &s;tupid.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants were withdrawn after &s;upper, I took a chair by him; filled his gla&s;s, and put it into his hand: he bowed, and drank the wine without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>"You are ill, Edward," &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"My head aches a little."</P>
<P>"Alas!&mdash;I fear your heart aches too!"&mdash; He &s;poke not; but &s;ighed&mdash;deeply &s;ighed &mdash;and leaned his dear face on my &s;houl|der.</P>
<P>"Something preys on your mind!"</P>
<P>"Nothing, my dear &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P><Q>Indeed there does! and you &s;hall not hide it from me. You have been a &s;harer in all my &s;orrows; you taught me to &s;upport them&mdash;Have I not then a right to partake of your's?</Q></P>
<P>He rai&s;ed his head with &s;ome degree of bri&s;kne&s;s:&mdash;<Q>Harriet, you can re|move the grief you &s;eek to know. I have a very lively friend&s;hip for Mi&s;s &mdash;</Q>. He &s;topt; and faulteringly pronounced&mdash;<Q>O'Bryen. You have told me &s;he is dependant; I cannot bear that
<PB N="232" REF="234">&s;he &s;hould remain &s;o. I dare not offer to make her otherwi&s;e; &s;he would refu&s;e me; perhaps I &s;hould even offend.&mdash; When I die, I cannot leave her any thing con&s;iderable, without &s;ubjecting her to the cen&s;ures of an ill-natured, mi&s;con|&s;truing world. I &s;hould be inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy, if I could transfer Mi&s;s Orm&s;by's fortune to her. Will you endeavour to prevail on her to accept forty thou&s;and pounds, as from your&s;elf? at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of that &s;um: le&s;s than twenty would be nothing. I need not tell you, that you mu&s;t proceed in the mo&s;t genteel and delicate manner.</Q>&mdash;I looked on him earne&s;tly.&mdash;<Q>If you love me, if you value my peace, oblige me in this.</Q> So &s;aying, he aro&s;e, and ha&s;|tily wi&s;hed me a good night.</P>
<P>He has "a lively friend&s;hip" for her; I doubt it not; for I <HI>feel</HI> that &s;he has every qualification, both of under&s;tanding and heart, requi&s;ite to in&s;pire and pre&s;erve that refined &s;entiment. But think you not, my dear Loui&s;a, that this lively friend&s;hip is joined to a much more lively pa&s;&s;ion? Can
<PB N="233" REF="235">his tumultuous &s;en&s;ations flow from tranquil friend&s;hip? Why do I a&s;k? He unque&s;|tionably loves her. He has too much fire to love with moderation&mdash;too much &s;tabi|lity to leave one room to doubt the dura|blene&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and, I may very ju&s;tly add, that Mi&s;s O'Bryen is too charming, and too worthy, not to be loved with ar|dour and con&s;tancy. What then, but cer|tain and uncea&s;ing mi&s;ery, can await his union with any other woman, however amiable?</P>
<P>This marriage &s;hall never be, if I can pre|vent it. I am &s;orry for the pain I mu&s;t give Mi&s;s Orm&s;by; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to con&s;ider her intere&s;t&mdash;or any body's intere&s;t &mdash;in oppo&s;ition to Edward's. A hand, without a heart, could not be acceptable to her, if &s;he be a woman of delicacy and honour: if not, &s;he is little worth being anxious about; and very, very unworthy &s;uch a hu&s;band as Sir Edward Marchmont.</P>
<P>I have ordered Thomas, who is to carry this letter, to &s;et off for Poplar-hill by day|break to-morrow. Let me have your an|&s;wer immediately. Direct me, my &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="234" REF="236">friend: I am wholly at a lo&s;s how to pro|ceed; matters have been carried &s;o far&mdash; But the happine&s;s of my dear&mdash;un&s;peakably dear&mdash;brother, is at &s;take. Nothing &s;hall di&s;courage me.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to a&s;&s;ure lady Methuen, how truly I am her friend.</P>
