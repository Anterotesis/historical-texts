<HEAD>PART I. OF THE NATURE OF <HI>CONTAGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of any Method, which &s;hall be propo&s;ed to pre|vent the &s;preading of <HI>Con|tagious</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es, may the better ap|pear, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome|what in general concerning <HI>Conta|gion,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="8">and the Manner, by which it acts.</P>
<P>CONTAGION is propagated by three Cau&s;es, the <HI>Air; Di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons;</HI> and <HI>Goods tran&s;ported from infected Places.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hall therefore fir&s;t enquire what alteration of the <HI>Air</HI> it is, that makes it <HI>in&s;ections;</HI> and then, by what Means it communicates its noxious Quality to other Bodies.</P>
<P>THE anciente&s;t and be&s;t Authors of Phy&s;ick, who lived in a Coun|try more expo&s;ed to the&s;e Calami|ties than ours, ob&s;erved the Con|&s;titution of the <HI>Air,</HI> which preceded <HI>Pe&s;tilential Fevers,</HI> to be great <HI>Heats</HI> attended with much <HI>Rain</HI> and <HI>South|erly Winds</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hippocrat. Epidem. lib. 3.</NOTE>: And one of Them takes particular Notice, that no o|ther
<PB N="3" REF="9">than a <HI>moi&s;t</HI> and <HI>hot</HI> Tempera|ment of the <HI>Air</HI> brings the <HI>Plague;</HI> and that the Duration of this Con|&s;titution is the Mea&s;ure of the Vio|lence of the Di&s;temper
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galen. de Temperament. lib. 1. cap. 4. &amp; Comment. in Epid. l. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Natural Hi&s;tory of &s;everal Countries confirms this Ob&s;ervati|on; in <HI>Africa</HI> particularly, if Show|ers fall during the &s;ultry Heats of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Plague</HI> en&s;ues thereupon, with which who&s;oever is infected hardly e&s;capes
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. J. Leon. Hi&s;tor. Afric. lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT has be&s;ides been remarked in all Times, that the Stinks of <HI>&s;tag|nating Waters</HI> in hot Weather, <HI>pu|trid Exhalations</HI> from the Earth; and above all, the Corruption of dead <HI>Carca&s;&s;es</HI> lying unburied, have occa&s;ioned <HI>infectious Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<P>FROM hence it appears to be a <HI>Concurrence</HI> of Cau&s;es, that pro|duces Di&s;ea&s;es of this Kind; which mu&s;t not only meet, but exert their Force together for a con&s;iderable time. And when this happens, their fir&s;t Effect is a Degree of <HI>Stag|nation</HI> in the Air, which is after|wards followed by <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Putrefaction.</HI></P>
<P>AND upon this account it is, that tho&s;e Countries are chiefly liable to the&s;e Calamities, where not only the <HI>Heats</HI> are very great, and the <HI>Weather</HI> continues long in the &s;ame State; but the <HI>Winds</HI> (the U&s;e of which is by Motion to purify the Air) do not &s;hift and change &s;o of|ten as they do in Northern Climates.</P>
<P>INDEED <HI>Plagues</HI> &s;eem to be of the Growth of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11">Parts of the World, and to be tran&s;|mitted from them into colder Cli|mates by the Way of <HI>Commerce.</HI> Nor do I think, that in this <HI>I&s;land</HI> particularly there is any one In|&s;tance of a <HI>Pe&s;tilential</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e a|mong us of great Con&s;equence; which we did not receive from o|ther <HI>infected</HI> Places.</P>
<P>THIS I the rather mention, be|cau&s;e it is a common Opinion, and propagated by Authors of great Name, that we are u&s;ually <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> with the <HI>Plague</HI> once in 30 or 40 Years; which is a mere Fancy with|out any Foundation either in Rea|&s;on or Experience: and therefore People ought to be delivered from the Subjection to &s;uch vain Fears.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, though we have had &s;everal Strokes of this kind, yet there are In&s;tances of
<PB N="6" REF="12">bad <HI>Contagions</HI> from abroad being brought over to us, which have proved le&s;s malignant here by our Air not being di&s;po&s;ed to receive &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sweating Sickne&s;s,</HI> called the <HI>Sudor Anglicus</HI> and <HI>Febris Ephemera Britannica,</HI> becau&s;e it was common|ly thought to have taken its Ri&s;e here, was mo&s;t probably of a foreign Original, and no other than a <HI>Plague</HI> abated in its Violence by the mild Temperament of our Climate.</P>
<P>FOR, we learn from Hi&s;tories, that the fir&s;t time this was felt here, which was in the Year 1485, it be|gan in the Army, with which King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. came from <HI>France,</HI> and landed in <HI>Wales</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Caium de Febre Ephemers Britannica.</NOTE>; and it was then thought to have been brought
<PB N="7" REF="13">into <HI>France</HI> from the famous Siege of <HI>Rhodes</HI> by the <HI>Turks</HI> 3 or 4 Years before. And of the four Returns, which this has made &s;ince that Time; two, viz. <HI>tho&s;e</HI> in the Years 1527, and 1528, may very ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected to have been owing to the <HI>Pe&s;tilence,</HI> which at tho&s;e Times raged in <HI>Italy,</HI> particularly at <HI>Flo|rence</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rondinelli Contagio in Firenze, &amp; Sum|monte Hi&s;tor. di Napoli.</NOTE>. And the others were very probably from a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Infection.</P>
<P>I call this Di&s;temper a <HI>Plague</HI> with le&s;&s;ened Force, becau&s;e the Symptoms of it were of that kind, though in a le&s;s Degree; as great <HI>Faintne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Inquietudes,</HI> inward <HI>Burning, Pain</HI> in the <HI>Head,</HI> a <HI>De|lirium</HI> &amp;c. All which were accom|panied with profu&s;e <HI>Sweats,</HI> and the Di&s;ea&s;e la&s;ted but 24 hours. And
<PB N="8" REF="14">though for want of Care and due Management many died of it; yet, as a learned and wi&s;e <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord</HI> Verulam's <HI>Hi&s;tory of</HI> Henry VII.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, <HI>It appeared rather to be a &s;urprize of Nature than ob&s;tinate to Remedies, for if the Patient was kept warm with temperate Cordials, he commonly recovered.</HI></P>
<P>AND I cannot but take Notice, as a Confirmation of what I have been advancing, that we had here the &s;ame kind of Fever in the Year 1713, about the Month of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> which was called the <HI>Dun|kirk Fever,</HI> as being brought by our Soldiers from that Place; where it was indeed a Malignant Di&s;ea&s;e attended with a <HI>Diarrhaea, Vomit|ing,</HI> &amp;c. and probably had its Ori|ginal from the Pe&s;tilential Di&s;tem|per, which &s;ome time before broke
<PB N="9" REF="15">out at <HI>Dantzick</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> But with us was much more mild, beginning only with a Pain in the Head, and by very ea&s;y Means went off in large <HI>Sweats,</HI> after a Day's Confinement.</P>
<P>THERE being in every Air a greater Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>Contagion</HI> at one Time than another, we have indeed &s;ometimes felt this Calami|ty with greater Fury; as particular|ly the la&s;t time in the Year 1665; when it continued in this <HI>City</HI> a|bout ten Months, and &s;wept away by computation 97306 Per&s;ons: But it was generally allowed, that the <HI>Contagion</HI> came by <HI>Cotton</HI> im|ported from <HI>Turkey</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Hodges de Pe&s;te.</NOTE>; and the long Duration of it, I believe, may ju&s;tly be charged up the unhappy Ma|nagement of infected Hou&s;es, which
<PB N="10" REF="16">was then directed by Publick Au|thority; as I &s;hall &s;hew anon.</P>
<P>AND the Hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t ter|rible of all the Plagues, that ever were in the&s;e Parts of the World, which was that in the Year 1349, gives a manife&s;t Proof from whence all <HI>Europe</HI> may trace the Origine of the&s;e Evils, viz. from <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> for
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Hi&s;tor. Fiorent. di Matteo Villani.</NOTE> This taking its Ri&s;e in <HI>China</HI> in the Year 1346, advanced through the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Syria, Turkey, Aegypt, Greece, Africa,</HI> &amp;c. In 1347 &s;ome Ships from the <HI>Levant</HI> carried it to <HI>Sicily, Pi&s;a, Genoa,</HI> &amp;c. In 1348 it got into <HI>Savoy, Provence, Dauphiny, Catalonia, Ca&s;tile,</HI> &amp;c. In 1349 it &s;eized <HI>England, Scot|land, Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and in the next place <HI>Germany, Hun|gary,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> and in all
<PB N="11" REF="17">the&s;e Countries made mo&s;t incredi|ble Havock.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Con&s;iderati|on of the Air, which we left in a putrid State: It is to be ob&s;erved, that Putrefaction is a kind of Fer|mentation, and that all Bodies in a Ferment emit a volatile active Spi|rit, of Power to agitate, and put into inte&s;tine Motions, that is, to change the Nature of other Flu|ids into which it in&s;inuates it &s;elf.</P>
<P>IT were ea&s;y to &s;hew from the be&s;t <HI>Theory</HI> of Fevers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bellini de Febrib.</NOTE>, how the Alterations made in the <HI>Blood</HI> this Way will favour <HI>Pe&s;tilential</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es, by rendring the Body obnoxious to them: But the Digre&s;&s;ion would be too great.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="18">
<P>THIS is one &s;tep towards <HI>Conta|gion.</HI> The next, as it &s;eems to me, proceeds after this Manner. The Blood in all <HI>Malignant Fevers,</HI> e&s;|pecially <HI>Pe&s;tilential</HI> ones, at the lat|ter End of the Di&s;ea&s;e, does like Fermenting Liquors throw off a great Quantity of active Particles upon the &s;everal <HI>Glands</HI> of the Bo|dy, particularly upon tho&s;e of the Mouth and Skin, from which the Secretions are naturally the mo&s;t con&s;tant and large. The&s;e, in <HI>Pe|&s;tilential</HI> Ca&s;es, although the Air be in a right State, will generally infect tho&s;e, who are very near to the &s;ick Per&s;on; otherwi&s;e are &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed and lo&s;t: But when in an evil Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>This</HI> they meet with the &s;ubtle Parts, its Corrup|tion has generated, by uniting with them they become much more active and powerful, and likewi&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="19">more durable and la&s;ting, &s;o as to form an <HI>Infectious Matter</HI> capable of conveying the Mi&s;chief to a great Di&s;tance from the di&s;ea&s;ed Body, out of which it was produced.</P>
<P>THEY who know what &s;trange Attractions and Combinations are made by volatile Spirits will under|&s;tanding this Rea&s;oning; e&s;pecially if they con&s;ider, how ea&s;ily all kinds of <HI>Effluvia</HI> are diffu&s;ed in a warm Air, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed an Infectious one to be; and further, of how penetrating a Force the fi|ne&s;t Parts of Animal Juices are; of which the &s;trange Stench of a mor|tified Limb, upon a Body yet liv|ing, will convince any one.</P>
<P>A corrupted State of Air is with|out doubt nece&s;&s;ary to give the&s;e <HI>Contagious Atoms</HI> their full Force; for otherwi&s;e it were not ea&s;y to
<PB N="14" REF="20">conceive how the <HI>Plague,</HI> when once it had &s;eized any Place, &s;hould ever cea&s;e, but with the De&s;tructi|on of all the Inhabitants: Which is readily accounted for by &s;uppo|&s;ing an Emendation of the Quali|ties of the Air, and the re&s;toring of it to a healthy State capable of di&s;&s;ipating and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Ma|lignity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand it is evident, that <HI>Infection</HI> is not received from the Air it &s;elf, however predi&s;po&s;ed, without the Concurrence of &s;ome|thing emitted from <HI>Infected</HI> Per|&s;ons; becau&s;e, by &s;trictly prevent|ing all Intercour&s;e of Infected Pla|ces with the Neighbourhood, it may be effectually kept from &s;preading: Whereas the lea&s;t Wind mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily convey whatever noxious Quality re&s;ides in the Air alone, even to a great Di&s;tance. Of this
<PB N="15" REF="21">we have had a fre&s;h Proof in the pre&s;ent unhappy <HI>Plague</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which, by keeping careful Guard, was confined for a con&s;iderable Time within the Walls of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles;</HI> &s;o that none of the adja|cent Villages &s;uffered any thing by it; till at length &s;ome Per&s;ons finding Means to e&s;cape carried the Infection along with them. And we find, they have been able, by the like Care, &s;till to re&s;train it within moderate Bounds.</P>
<P>THIS is the Manner by which Infectious <HI>Effluvia</HI> are generated: The Way, by which a &s;ound Per&s;on receives the Injury, I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t commonly to be this. The&s;e <HI>Conta|gious</HI> Particles being drawn in with the Air we breath, they taint in their Pa&s;&s;age the <HI>Salival</HI> Juices, which being &s;wallowed down into the Stomach pre&s;ently fix their Ma|lignity
<PB N="16" REF="22">there; as appears from the <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> and <HI>Vomiting,</HI> with which the Di&s;temper often begins its fir&s;t Attacks. Though I make no Que|&s;tion but the <HI>Blood</HI> is al&s;o more im|mediately affected by hurtful Parti|cles being mixed through In&s;piration with it in the Lungs.</P>
<P>THE third Way, by which we mentioned <HI>Contagion</HI> to be &s;pread, is by <HI>Goods tran&s;ported from infected Places.</HI> It has been thought &s;o dif|ficult to explain the Manner of <HI>this,</HI> that &s;ome Authors have ima|gined <HI>Infection</HI> to be performed by the Means of <HI>In&s;ects,</HI> the <HI>Eggs</HI> of which may be conveyed from Place to Place, and make the Di&s;ea&s;e when they come to be <HI>hatched.</HI> As this is a &s;uppo&s;ition grounded upon no manner of Ob&s;ervation, &s;o I think there is no need to have Re|cour&s;e to it. If, as we have con|jectured,
<PB N="17" REF="23">the <HI>Matter of Contagion</HI> be an active Sub&s;tance, perhaps in the Nature of a <HI>Salt,</HI> generated chiefly from the Corruption of a <HI>Humane Body,</HI> it is not hard to conceive how this may be lodged and pre&s;erved in &s;oft, porous Bo|dies, which are kept pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e together.</P>
<P>WE all know how long a time <HI>Perfumes</HI> hold their <HI>Scent,</HI> if wrapt up in proper Coverings: And it is very remarkable, that the &s;tronge&s;t of the&s;e, like the <HI>Matter</HI> we are treating of, are mo&s;tly <HI>Animal</HI> Juices, as <HI>Mo&s;ch, Civet,</HI> &amp;c. and that the Sub&s;tances found mo&s;t fit to keep them in, are the very &s;ame with tho&s;e which are mo&s;t apt to receive and communicate <HI>Infection,</HI> as, <HI>Furrs, Feathers, Silk, Hair, Wool, Cotton, Flax,</HI> &amp;c. the great|e&s;t Part of which are likewi&s;e of
<PB N="18" REF="24">the Animal Kind; which Remark alone may &s;erve to lead Us a little into the true Nature of <HI>Contagion.</HI></P>
<P>FROM all that has been &s;aid, it appears, I think, very plainly, that the <HI>Plague</HI> is a real Poi&s;on, which being bred in the Ea&s;tern or South|ern Parts of the World, maintains it &s;elf there by circulating from <HI>In|fected</HI> Per&s;ons to Goods; which is chiefly owing to the Negligence of the People in tho&s;e Countries, who are &s;tupidly Carele&s;s in this Affair: That when the Con&s;titution of the Air happens to favour Infection, it rages there with great Violence; That at that Time more e&s;pecially di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons give it to one ano|ther, and <HI>Contagious Matter</HI> is lodg|ed in Goods of a loo&s;e and &s;oft Texture, which being packt up, and carried into other Countries, let out, when opened, the impri|&s;oned
<PB N="19" REF="25">Seeds of Contagion: And la&s;tly, That the Air cannot diffu&s;e and &s;pread the&s;e to any great Di|&s;tance, if Intercour&s;e and Commerce with the Place infected be &s;trictly prevented.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF THE METHODS TO PREVENT <HI>CONTAGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS it is a &s;atisfaction to know, that the <HI>Plague</HI> is not a Native of our Coun|try, &s;o this is likewi&s;e an Encouragement to the utmo&s;t Dili|gence in finding out Means to keep our &s;elves clear from It.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="27">
<P>THIS Caution con&s;i&s;ts of two Parts: <HI>The preventing its being brought into our I&s;land;</HI> And, if &s;uch a Calamity &s;hould happen, <HI>The putting a &s;top to its &s;preading among us.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e is provided for by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Method of obliging Ships, that come from <HI>Infected</HI> Places, to <HI>perform Quaren|tine:</HI> As to which I think it nece&s;|&s;ary, that the following Rules be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>NEAR to our &s;everal Ports, there &s;hould be <HI>Lazarettos</HI> built in con|venient Places, on little I&s;lands if it can &s;o be, for the Reception both of Men and Goods, which arrive from Places &s;u&s;pected of <HI>Infection:</HI> The keeping Men in <HI>Quarentine</HI> on board the Ship being not &s;uffi|cient;
<PB N="22" REF="28">the only U&s;e of which is to ob&s;erve whether any dye among them. For <HI>Infection</HI> may be pre|&s;erved &s;o long in Cloaths, in which it is once lodged, that as much, nay more of it, if Sickne&s;s conti|nues in the Ship, may be brought on Shoar at the End than at the be|ginning of the 40 Days: Unle&s;s a new <HI>Quarentine</HI> be begun every time any Per&s;on dies; which might not end, but with the De&s;truction of the whole Ship's Crew.</P>
<P>IF there has been any <HI>Contagi|ous</HI> Di&s;temper in the Ship; The <HI>Sound</HI> Men &s;hould leave their Cloaths; which &s;hould be burnt; the Men wa&s;hed and &s;haved; and having fre&s;h Cloaths, &s;hould &s;tay in the <HI>Lazaretto</HI> 30 or 40 Days.

<P>IF there has been no Sickne&s;s in the Ship, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Men &s;hould perform <HI>Quarentine.</HI> In&s;tead of this, they may be wa&s;hed, and their Cloaths aired in the <HI>La|zaretto,</HI> as Goods, for one Week.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Danger is from &s;uch <HI>Goods,</HI> as are apt to retain In|fection, &s;uch as <HI>Cotton, Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax, Paper</HI> or <HI>Books, Silk</HI> of all &s;orts, <HI>Linen, Wool, Feathers, Hair,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>Skins.</HI> The <HI>Laza|retto</HI>

<P>THIS may perhaps &s;eem too long; but as we don't know how much Time preci&s;ely is nece&s;&s;ary to purge the Inter&s;tices of Spongy Sub&s;tances from <HI>infectious Matter</HI> by fre&s;h Air, the Caution cannot be too great in this Point: Unle&s;s there could be a Way found out, without hazard|ing Men's Lives, of trying when Bodies have done emitting the Noxious Fumes; which po&s;&s;ibly might be done by putting tender <HI>Animals</HI> near to them, particularly by &s;etting little <HI>Birds</HI> upon the ex|po&s;ed Goods; becau&s;e it has been ob&s;erved in Times of the <HI>Plague,</HI> that the Country has been for&s;aken

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Diemerbroeck de Pe&s;te, L. 1. C. 4.</NOTE>. But the U&s;e of this Fancy Expe|rience only mu&s;t &s;hew; for I am well aware, that all <HI>Plagues</HI> do not indifferently affect all Kinds of liv|ing Creatures; on the contrary, mo&s;t are confined to a particular <HI>Species</HI> of them; like the Di&s;ea&s;e of the <HI>Black Cattle</HI> a few Years &s;ince, which neither proved Infectious to other Brutes, nor to Men.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, that the <HI>Goods</HI> &s;hould be <HI>opened,</HI> when they are put into the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> other|wi&s;e their being there will avail nothing. The Misfortune, which happened in the I&s;land of <HI>Bermudas</HI> about 25 Years &s;ince, gives a Proof of this; where, as the Account
<PB N="27" REF="33">has been given me by the learned Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> a Sack of <HI>Cotton,</HI> put on Shoar by Stealth, lay above a Month without any Prejudice to the People of the Hou&s;e, where it was hid; but when it came to be di&s;tributed among the Inhabitants, it carried &s;uch a <HI>Contagion</HI> along with it, that the living &s;carce &s;uf|ficed to bury the Dead.</P>
<P>INDEED as it has been frequently experienced, that of all the Goods, which harbour <HI>Infection, Cotton</HI> in particular is the mo&s;t dangerous, and <HI>Turkey</HI> is almo&s;t a perpetual <HI>Seminary</HI> of the <HI>Plague;</HI> I cannot but think it highly rea&s;onable, that whatever <HI>Cotton</HI> is imported from that Part of the World, &s;hould at all Times be kept in <HI>Quarentine;</HI> becau&s;e it may have imbibed <HI>In|fection</HI> at the Time of its packing up, notwith&s;tanding no Mi&s;chief
<PB N="28" REF="34">has been felt from it by the Ship's Company.</P>
<P>As all rea&s;onable Provi&s;ions &s;hould be made both for the <HI>Sound</HI> and <HI>Sick,</HI> who perform <HI>Quarentine;</HI> &s;o the &s;trict keeping of it ought to be inforced by the &s;evere&s;t <HI>Penalties.</HI> And if a Ship come from any Place, where the <HI>Plague</HI> raged, at the Time of the Ship's Departure from it, with more than u&s;ual Violence, it will be the &s;ecure&s;t Method to <HI>Burn</HI> all the <HI>Goods,</HI> and even the <HI>Ship.</HI></P>
<P>NOR ought this further Caution to be omitted, That when the <HI>Con|tagion</HI> has cea&s;ed in any Place by the approach of Winter, it will not be &s;afe to open a free Trade with It too &s;oon: Becau&s;e there are In|&s;tances of the <HI>Di&s;temper's</HI> being &s;topt by the Winter Cold, and yet the Seeds of it not de&s;troyed, but
<PB N="29" REF="35">only kept unactive, till the Warmth of the following Spring has given them new Life and Force. Thus in the great Plague at <HI>Genoa</HI> near 60 Years ago, which continued part of two Years; the fir&s;t Sum|mer about 10000 dyed; the Win|ter following hardly any; but the Summer after no le&s;s than 60000. So likewi&s;e the la&s;t <HI>Plague</HI> at <HI>Lon|don</HI> began the Autumn before the Year 1665, and was &s;topt during the Winter by a hard Fro&s;t of near three Month's Continuance; &s;o that there remained no further Ap|pearance of it till the en&s;uing Spring
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hodges de Pe&s;te.</NOTE>. Now if Goods brought from &s;uch a Place &s;hould retain a|ny of the latent Contagion, there will be Danger of their producing the &s;ame Mi&s;chief in the Place, to which they are brought, as they
<PB N="30" REF="36">would have cau&s;ed in that, from whence they came.</P>
<P>BUT above all it is nece&s;&s;ary, that the <HI>Clande&s;tine Importing</HI> of Goods be puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t Ri|gour; from which wicked Practice I &s;hould at this Time apprehend more Danger of bringing the <HI>Di|&s;ea&s;e</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> than by any o|ther Way what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THESE are, I think, the mo&s;t material Points, to which Regard is to be had in defending our&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Contagion</HI> from other Coun|tries. The particular Manner of putting the&s;e Directions in Execu|tion, as the <HI>Vi&s;iting</HI> of <HI>Ships, Re|gulation</HI> of <HI>Lazaretto's,</HI> &amp;c. I leave to proper Officers, who ought &s;ometimes to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted herein by able Phy&s;icians.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="37">
<P>THE next Con&s;ideration is, What to do in Ca&s;e, through a Mi&s;carriage in the publick Care, by the Neglect of Officers, or otherwi&s;e, &s;uch a Calamity &s;hould be &s;uffered to be|fall us.</P>
<P>THERE is no <HI>Evil</HI> in the World, in which the great Rule of <HI>Re&s;i&s;t|ing the Beginning,</HI> more properly takes Place, than in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; and yet it has unfortunately happened, that the common Steps formerly taken have had a direct Tendency to hinder the putting <HI>this Maxim</HI> in Practice.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Plague</HI> always breaks out in &s;ome particular Place, it is cer|tain, that the Directions of the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> ought to be &s;uch, as to make it as much for the In|tere&s;t of Families to di&s;cover their
<PB N="32" REF="38">Misfortune, as it is, when a Hou&s;e is on <HI>Fire,</HI> to call in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Neighbourhood: Whereas on the contrary, the Methods taken by the Publick, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, have always had the Appearance of a &s;evere <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> and even <HI>Puni&s;h|ment,</HI> rather than of a <HI>Compa&s;&s;i|onate Care:</HI> Which mu&s;t naturally make the <HI>Infected</HI> conceal the Di&s;|ea&s;e as long as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE main Import of the <HI>Orders</HI> i&s;&s;ued out at the&s;e Times was, As &s;oon as it was found, that any Hou&s;e was infected, to keep it &s;hut up, with a <HI>large red Cro&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us</HI> on the Door; and Watchmen attending Day and Night to prevent any one's going in or out, except <HI>Phy&s;icians, Surge|ons, Apothecaries, Nur&s;es, Search|ers,</HI> &amp;c. allowed by Authority: And this to continue at lea&s;t a

<P>IT is not ea&s;y to conceive a more di&s;mal Scene of Mi&s;ery, than this; Families &s;eized with a Di&s;temper, which the mo&s;t of any in the World requires Help and Comfort, lockt up from all their Acquaint|ance; left it may be to the Treat|ment of an inhumane Nur&s;e (for &s;uch are often found at the&s;e Times about the Sick;) and Strangers to every thing but the Melancholy &s;ight of the Progre&s;s, Death makes among them&s;elves; with &s;mall Hopes of Life, and tho&s;e mixed with Anxiety and Doubt, whether it be not better to Dye, than to &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of their be&s;t Friends, and neare&s;t Relations.</P>

<P>NOTHING can ju&s;tify &s;uch <HI>Cruel|ty,</HI> but the Plea, that it is for the Good of the whole <HI>Community,</HI> and prevents the &s;preading of <HI>In|fection.</HI> But this upon due Con&s;i|deration will be found quite other|wi&s;e: For while <HI>Contagion</HI> is kept nur&s;ed up in a Hou&s;e, and conti|nually encrea&s;ed by the daily Con|que&s;ts it makes, it is impo&s;&s;ible but the <HI>Air</HI> &s;hould by Degrees become <HI>tainted,</HI> which by opening Win|dows, &amp;c. will carry the Malig|nity fir&s;t from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e;
<PB N="35" REF="41">and then from one Street to ano|ther. The &s;hutting up Hou&s;es in this Manner is only keeping &s;o ma|ny <HI>Seminaries</HI> of <HI>Contagion,</HI> &s;ooner or later to be di&s;per&s;ed abroad: For the waiting a Month, or longer, from the Death of the la&s;t Patient will avail no more, than keeping a <HI>Bale</HI> of infected <HI>Goods</HI> unpack'd; the Poy&s;on will fly out, whenever the <HI>Pandora's Box</HI> is opened.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Mea&s;ures were owing to the Ignorance of the true Nature of <HI>Contagion,</HI> &s;o they did, I firmly believe, contribute very much to the long Continuance of the <HI>Plague,</HI> every time they have been practi&s;|ed in this City: And no doubt they have had as ill Effects in o|ther Countries.</P>
<P>IT is therefore no wonder, that great Complaints were &s;ometimes

<PB N="48" REF="54">to de&s;troy the Matter of <HI>Infection,</HI> or to keep particular Places from a Di&s;po&s;ition to receive it; which are the only things here to be aimed at. It is of more Con&s;equence to be ob&s;erved, that as <HI>Na&s;tine&s;s</HI> is a great Source of <HI>Infection,</HI> &s;o <HI>Clean|line&s;s</HI> is the greate&s;t Pre&s;ervative: Which is the true Rea&s;on, why the Poor are mo&s;t obnoxious to Di&s;|a&s;ters of this Kind.</P>
<P>THE next thing after the <HI>purifying of Hou&s;es,</HI> is to con&s;ider by what Means particular <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> may be&s;t defend them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Contagi|on;</HI> for the effectual doing of which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to put the <HI>Humours</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> into &s;uch a State, as not to be alterable by the <HI>Matter of Infection.</HI> But &s;ince this is no more to be hoped for, than a <HI>Specific Pre&s;ervative</HI> from the <HI>Small-Pox;</HI> the mo&s;t that can be
<PB N="49" REF="55">done, will be to keep the <HI>Body</HI> in &s;uch Order, that it may &s;uffer as little as po&s;&s;ible. The <HI>fir&s;t Step</HI> to|wards which, is to maintain a good State of Health, in which we are always lea&s;t liable to &s;uffer by any external Injuries; and not to weaken the Body by Evacuations. The <HI>next</HI> is, to guard again&s;t all <HI>Dejecti|on of Spirits,</HI> and <HI>immoderate Pa&s;|&s;ions;</HI> for the&s;e we daily ob&s;erve do expo&s;e Per&s;ons to the more com|mon <HI>Contagion</HI> of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> The&s;e Ends will be be&s;t an&s;wered by living with Temperance upon a good generous Diet, and avoiding <HI>Fa&s;tings, Watchings, extreme Weari|ne&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Another</HI> Defence is, to u&s;e whatever Means are proper to keep the <HI>Blood</HI> from <HI>Inflaming.</HI> This, if it does not &s;ecure from <HI>contracting Infection,</HI> will at lea&s;t make the <HI>Effects</HI> of it le&s;s violent.
<PB N="50" REF="56">The mo&s;t proper Means for this, according to the Advice of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Phy&s;icians, is the repeat|ed U&s;e of <HI>acid Fruits,</HI> as <HI>Pomegra|nates, Sevil Oranges, Lemons, tart Apples,</HI> &amp;c. But above all of <HI>Wine-Vinegar</HI> in &s;mall Quantities, ren|dered grateful to the Stomach by the Infu&s;ion of &s;ome &s;uch Ingre|dients as <HI>Gentian Root, Galangal, Zedoary, Juniper Berries,</HI> &amp;c. Which Medicines by correcting the <HI>Vine|gar,</HI> and taking off &s;ome ill Effects it might otherwi&s;e have upon the Stomach, will be of good U&s;e: But the&s;e, and all other hot <HI>Aro|matic</HI> Drugs, though much recom|mended by Authors, if u&s;ed alone, are mo&s;t likely to do hurt by <HI>over heating</HI> the Blood.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince none of the&s;e Methods promi&s;e any certain Protection; as
<PB N="51" REF="57"><HI>leaving</HI> the Place infected is the &s;ure&s;t <HI>Pre&s;ervative,</HI> &s;o the next to it, is to avoid, as much as may be, the <HI>near Approach</HI> to the <HI>Sick,</HI> or to &s;uch as have but <HI>lately Recover|ed.</HI> For the greater Security here|in, it will be advi&s;able to avoid all <HI>Crouds of People.</HI> Nay it &s;hould be the Care of the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> to prohibit all unnece&s;&s;ary <HI>A&s;&s;emblies;</HI> and likewi&s;e to oblige all, who get over the Di&s;ea&s;e, to <HI>Confine</HI> them|&s;elves for &s;ome time, before they appear abroad.</P>
<P>THE Advice to keep at a Di|&s;tance from the <HI>Sick,</HI> is al&s;o to be under&s;tood of the <HI>Dead Bodies:</HI> which &s;hould be <HI>buried</HI> at as great a Di&s;tance from Dwelling Hou&s;es, as may be; put <HI>deep</HI> in the Earth; and <HI>covered</HI> with the exacte&s;t Care. They &s;hould likewi&s;e be <HI>carried out</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="58">in the <HI>Night,</HI> while they are yet fre&s;h and free from Putrefaction: Becau&s;e a Carca&s;s not yet begin|ning to Corrupt, if kept from the Heat of the Day, hardly emits any kind of Steam or Vapour.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e, who mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity attend the <HI>Sick;</HI> &s;ome fur|ther Directions &s;hould be added for their U&s;e. The&s;e may be com|prehended in two &s;hort Precepts. <HI>One</HI> is, not to <HI>&s;wallow their Spittle</HI> while they are about the <HI>Sick,</HI> but rather to <HI>&s;pit</HI> it out: <HI>The other,</HI> not &s;o much as to <HI>draw in their Breath,</HI> when they are very near them. The rea&s;on for both the&s;e appears from what has been &s;aid above con|cerning the Manner, in which a &s;ound Per&s;on receives the Infecti|on.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="59">
<P>THIS is the Sum of what I think mo&s;t likely to &s;top the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> in any Place, where it &s;hall have got Admittance. If &s;ome few of the&s;e <HI>Rules</HI> refer more par|ticularly to the City of <HI>London,</HI> with &s;mall Alteration they may be applied to any other <HI>Place.</HI> It now remains therefore only to lay down &s;ome Directions to hinder the <HI>Di&s;temper's</HI> &s;preading from <HI>Town</HI> to <HI>Town.</HI> The be&s;t Method for which, where it can be done, is to ca&s;t up a <HI>Line</HI> about the <HI>Town in&s;ected,</HI> at a convenient Di&s;tance; and by placing a <HI>Guard,</HI> to hin|der People's pa&s;&s;ing from it with|out due Regulation, to other Towns: But not ab&s;olutely to for|bid any to withdraw them&s;elves, as they have now done in <HI>France,</HI> ac|cording to the u&s;ual Practice abroad;
<PB N="54" REF="60">which is an unnece&s;&s;ary Severity, not to call it a Cruelty. I think it will be enough, if all, who de&s;ire to pa&s;s the <HI>Line,</HI> be permitted to do it, upon Condition they fir&s;t per|form <HI>Quarentine</HI> for about 20 Days in <HI>Tents,</HI> or other more conveni|ent <HI>Habitations.</HI> But the greate&s;t Care mu&s;t be taken, that none pa&s;s without conforming them&s;elves to this Order, both by keeping di|ligent <HI>Watch,</HI> and by <HI>puni&s;hing</HI> with the utmo&s;t Severity, any that &s;hall either have done &s;o, or at|tempt it. And the better to di&s;co|ver <HI>&s;uch,</HI> it will be requi&s;ite to o|blige all, who travel in any Part of the Country, under the &s;ame Penalties, to carry with them <HI>Cer|tificates</HI> either of their coming from Places not <HI>Infected,</HI> or of their pa&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Line</HI> by permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="61">
<P>THIS I take to be a more effectu|al Method to keep the <HI>Infection</HI> from &s;preading, than the ab&s;olute refu&s;ing a Pa&s;&s;age to People upon any Terms. For when Men are in &s;uch imminent Danger of their Lives, where they are; many, no doubt, if not otherwi&s;e allowed to e&s;cape, will u&s;e Endeavours to do it &s;ecretly, let the Hazard be ever &s;o great. And it can hardly be, but &s;ome will &s;ucceed in their At|tempts; as we &s;ee fell out in <HI>France</HI> notwith&s;tanding all their Care. But one that gets off thus clande&s;tine|ly, will be more like to carry the Di&s;temper with him, than twenty, nay a hundred, that go away un|der the preceding Re&s;trictions: E|&s;pecially becau&s;e the <HI>Infection</HI> of the Place, he flies from, will by this Management be rendered much
<PB N="56" REF="62">more inten&s;e. For confining Peo|ple, and &s;hutting them up together in great Numbers, will make the Di&s;temper rage with augmented Force, even to the increa&s;ing it be|yond what can be ea&s;ily imagin|ed; As appears from the <HI>Account,</HI> which the learned <HI>Ga&s;&s;endus</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notitia Ecclefiae Dinienfis.</NOTE> has given us of a memorable <HI>Plague,</HI> which happened at <HI>Digne</HI> in <HI>Pro|vence,</HI> where he lived, in the Year 1619. This was &s;o terrible, that in one <HI>Summer</HI> out of <HI>ten thou&s;and</HI> Inhabitants, it left but <HI>fifteen hun|dred,</HI> and of them all but <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> had gone through the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> And he a&s;&s;igns <HI>this,</HI> as the princi|pal Cau&s;e of the great De&s;truction, That the Citizens were too clo&s;ely confined, and not &s;uffered &s;o much as to go to their Country Hou&s;es.
<PB N="57" REF="63">Whereas in another <HI>Pe&s;tilence,</HI> which broke out in the &s;ame Place a year and half after, more Liberty being allowed, there did not dye above <HI>one hundred</HI> Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I think, to allow People with proper <HI>Cautions</HI> to remove from an infected Place, is the be&s;t Means to &s;uppre&s;s the <HI>Contagion,</HI> as well as the mo&s;t humane Treatment of the pre&s;ent Sufferers: But though Liberty ought to be given to the <HI>People,</HI> yet no &s;ort of <HI>Goods</HI> mu&s;t by any means be &s;uffered to be carried over the <HI>Line,</HI> which are made of <HI>Mate|rials</HI> retentive of <HI>Infection.</HI> For in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, when <HI>In|fection</HI> has &s;eized any Part of a Country, much greater Care ought to be taken, that no <HI>Seeds</HI> of the <HI>Contagion</HI> be conveyed about, than
<PB N="58" REF="64">when the Di&s;temper is at a great Di&s;tance; becau&s;e a <HI>Bale of Goods,</HI> which &s;hall have imbibed the <HI>Con|tagious Aura</HI> when packt up in <HI>Turkey,</HI> or any remote Parts; yet, when unpackt here, may chance to meet with &s;o healthful a Tempe|rament of our Air, that it &s;hall not do much hurt. But when the Air of any one of our Towns &s;hall be &s;o corrupted, as to &s;pread and maintain the <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> in it, there will be little rea&s;on to believe, that the Air of the re&s;t of the Country is in a much better State.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame Rea&s;on <HI>Quaren|tines</HI> &s;hould more &s;trictly be en|joined, when the <HI>Plague</HI> is in a bordering Kingdom, than when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s more remote.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="65">
<P>I have gone through the chief Branches of <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Plague.</HI> And &s;hall only add, that if the <HI>Burning of Goods,</HI> which has been propo&s;ed, be thought a|ny Way <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> or <HI>inconvenient,</HI> The <HI>Burying</HI> of them &s;ix Feet, or more, under Ground may an&s;wer the Purpo&s;e as well.</P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid of the <HI>Na|ture of Contagion,</HI> upon which the foregoing Directions are grounded, may al&s;o be of U&s;e towards e|&s;tabli&s;hing a better Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> than <HI>Authors</HI> have common|ly taught: But to engage in this is beyond the pre&s;ent De&s;ign.</P>
