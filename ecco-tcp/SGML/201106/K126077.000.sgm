<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Gout</HI> is a ten&s;ive and lacerating Pain about the Joints, chiefly returning in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hippoc.</HI> Sect. vi. Aphori&s;m 55.</NOTE> Spring and Autumn, ari&s;|ing from an Ob&s;truction in the nervous Ve&s;&s;els and A|crimony of the Fluids; whence Redne&s;s, Swelling, and chalky Con|cretions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boer|haave</HI> Aphori&s;. 1254-61, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. In general it is called <HI>Arthritis,</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> Word <GAP DESC="foreign">, &s;ignifying a Joint, becau&s;e this Complaint chiefly &s;eizes tho&s;e Parts. It likewi&s;e takes its Name from the &s;everal Parts of the Body it attacks, to wit, in the Hands, <HI>Chiragra</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign">
<PB N="8" REF="6">a Hand, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Prey or Seizure, there|by denoting its cruel Ravages and Injury where&s;oever it comes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sciatica</HI> or <HI>Hip-Gout,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign"> the Hip. In the Knees <HI>Gonogra,</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign"> the Knee, and <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P><HI>Podagra</HI> in like manner is from <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Foot, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, whence the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Feet is &s;o termed.</P>
<P>There are various other Denominations which all take their origin from the parts affected, the Cau&s;e being &s;till the &s;ame, &s;ome|times &s;eizing one Place &s;ometimes another.</P>
<P>Many are apt to believe the <HI>Rheuma|ti&s;m</HI> to be either <HI>Gout</HI> or <HI>Scurvy,</HI> but impro|perly; it has its Name from <GAP DESC="foreign">, to flow, hence <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Rheum, thereby denoting a Flowing of Humours to a Part, yet the <HI>Rheu|mati&s;m</HI> partakes &s;omewhat of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The renowned <HI>Sydenham</HI> hath well treated this Di&s;ea&s;e, yet mu&s;t own in my Opinion, he makes u&s;e of bleeding too frequently. It chiefly &s;hews it&s;elf in the &s;ame Places, where the <HI>Gout</HI> appears, whence in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Mi&s;take ari&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lumbago</HI> was ob&s;erved by the An|tients; in which the Pain in the Loins is &s;o great, that the Patient is obliged to &s;it or &s;tand upright: If he moves to either Side, or endeavours to bend forward or backward, then he &s;uffers excruciating Pains, and &s;ome|times even Convul&s;ions. The &s;ame Diffi|culties
<PB N="9" REF="7">are found in moving the Neck, if that Part is afflicted, as it often happens to be. When it &s;eizes the Region of the <HI>Os &s;acrum</HI> it is often termed the <HI>lower rheu|matic Lumbago;</HI> by &s;ome al&s;o it is called the <HI>rheumatic Gonogra,</HI> if in the Knees: Yet this Di&s;ea&s;e may for the mo&s;t part be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Scurvy;</HI> if the Per&s;on has not had either of the&s;e be|fore, then I &s;hould e&s;teem it the <HI>Rheuma|ti&s;m,</HI> and not the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me here to explain the Cau&s;e of the regular Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> which invades a little before the vernal E|quinox, and after the autumnal; for <HI>Win|tringham</HI> has learnedly treated of this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. iv. See al&s;o <HI>De Gorter</HI>'s Commentary in his <HI>Medicina Hippocratica</HI> on <HI>Hipp.</HI> Sect. vi. Aphori&s;m 55.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The noble <HI>Willis</HI> and <HI>Hein&s;ius</HI> al&s;o [who has wrote in <HI>Dutch</HI> a Tract of this Malady] de&s;erves to be read again and again; which makes good the old Proverb,</P>
<Q><HI>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit.</HI></Q>
<P>The <HI>Gout</HI> under its various Denomina|tions is either <HI>hereditary</HI> or <HI>acquired.</HI> Its Cau&s;e is two fold,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From a Straitne&s;s and Rigidity or Stiffne&s;s of the nervous Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From an Acrimony and Tena|city of the Fluids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>H. Boerh.</HI> Aphori&s;m. 1262-63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence every Fault committed in the <HI>Non-naturals</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To wit, Air, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Watch|ing, Motion and Re&s;t, Retention and Excretion, and the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind.</NOTE> (as they are termed by Phy|&s;icians) ha&s;ten and bring on the Fit. It principally afflicts in Parts remote from the Brain. The Defect lies in the la&s;t Office of Dige&s;tion. 1&s;t. From our Food is Chyle produced, 2dly. The Serum or Whey, 3dly. The Blood, and la&s;tly, The nervous Spirit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> or Organs of the fir&s;t Con|coctions are good, but that ultimate or la&s;t Effect is not properly performed. Our Ma|&s;ter of the Faculty, the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> is of the &s;ame Opinion; for he &s;aw a Patient who had about the Joint a Swelling that broke without Pain; he forced a Needle quite through to the Bone without any Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and took out this chalky Matter which was made up with the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;|&s;els, thus de&s;troyed and changed. It is al&s;o plain, that the Blood, Serum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not in fault, for they equally exerci&s;e their &s;everal Functions; the gouty Subject can rea|&s;on properly, and feels the Power of Love as before: Hence I have often admired <HI>Hip|pocrates,</HI> where he &s;ays, the <HI>Gout</HI> clean&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="9">the mo&s;t minute Rece&s;&s;es of the Blood in old Men; for after a Fit, they, for the mo&s;t part remain free and well for Months; and in this Cour&s;e, they may obtain the good old Age of Four&s;core or upwards; where|fore this Di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t not be in the Blood, but in the Ultimate <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Spirit of the Blood.</P>
<P>Hence it is nece&s;&s;ary (as al&s;o <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> and <HI>Helmont</HI> ob&s;erves) that the whole Body be recruited in the Solids, and the Fluids mended, and corrected before the Cure can be accompli&s;hed; but this is to be done by re&s;torative Medicaments, and not tho&s;e of a purgative Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Otto Tachenius</HI> (in his Tract <HI>de Morborum Principe</HI>) &s;ays, that a &s;ubtile corroding Acid is the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and hence an <HI>Alcali,</HI> it being quite an Oppo&s;ite, de&s;troying and driving out the Malady, he e&s;teems as a Specific: which acrid Cau&s;e, ari&s;ing from too great Rigidity or Straitne&s;s in the Ve&s;&s;els, Venery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> de&s;troys the be&s;t and fine&s;t Part of the Nerves. He got great Profit by this Invention, yet the Medicine did not an&s;wer. It is in&s;cribed on the Statue erected to the Memory of <HI>Paracel&s;us,</HI> that he could cure the <HI>Gout,</HI> by which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is to be under&s;tood, he cured the Fit by order|ing a good Diet, giving proper Anodynes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this does not root out the Seeds of the Di&s;ea&s;e; Nature left to her&s;elf would have performed thus much.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<P>A Man in <HI>Holland</HI> made Trial of all the Remedies he could pick up, among the re&s;t the <HI>Caryoco&s;tinum,</HI> but was much the wor&s;e for it, notwith&s;tanding the great Prai&s;es given it by its Inventor <HI>Eugenius.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> as well as in <HI>Holland,</HI> there is a noted Powder highly recommended in this Di&s;ea&s;e; it is made with <HI>Germander, Ground-pine,</HI> the le&s;&s;er <HI>Centaury,</HI> the Roots of <HI>Birthworth</HI> and <HI>Gentian;</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the Title of the Great and Noble Duke of <HI>Portland.</HI> It is true, this Powder will mitigate the Pains; but in my Practice, I have found it to produce Ob&s;tructions in the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, and cau&s;e the morbid Matter to attack fre&s;h Places; hence if it &s;hould retire to &s;ome of the more noble <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> Death in a &s;hort Time, mu&s;t be the Event. I readily own, that if the gouty Per&s;on, having this Malady, only in a recent and &s;light manner, ob&s;erves a good Diet, during the U&s;e of this Powder, he may, for a Time, have his Pains le&s;&s;ened and abated; but it is not in the Power of this Remedy to era|dicate the peccant Matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gout</HI> is not only dangerous in it|&s;elf, but likewi&s;e of all Di&s;ea&s;es the mo&s;t &s;evere, and ob&s;tinate in its Continuance, tormenting poor Mortals, for the mo&s;t part, as long as Li&s;e la&s;ts; from whence the Saying,</P>
<Q><HI>Tollere nodo&s;am ne&s;cit medicina podagram.</HI>
<BIBL>JUVENAL.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<P>We may further add the Words of Dr. <HI>Wintringham</HI> in the End of his Treati&s;e, where he ob&s;erves, <Q>"That notwith&s;tand|ing the vain Boa&s;tings of <HI>Empirics,</HI> it is quite evident, that no Specific has been given, by the Help of which, this Di|&s;ea&s;e has been rooted out."</Q></P>

<P><HI>H. Boerhaave</HI> Aphori&s;m. 1269.</P></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Our Father <HI>Hippocrates</HI> has here declared Things worth notice, but yet he does not &s;ay this Di&s;ea&s;e is incurable.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>"That this Di&s;ea&s;e cannot be cured, unle&s;s by Medicines, which have Power to cor|rect and change the bad State of the Body, whence this Di&s;order ari&s;es &Verbar;."</Q></P>
<P>The hereditary <HI>Gout,</HI> and that attended with &s;tony Concretions are of all the mo&s;t dif|ficult to cure &Dagger;. For the hereditary is the Effect of the whole Compages of the human Machine, and &s;hews it&s;elf in its own pro|per
<PB N="14" REF="12">time, in like manner, as the Secretion of the male Seed appears after Puberty, having its Origin from the Nerves &s;o ingen|dered.</P>
<P>The Tophi, or Chalk-&s;tones do not hap|pen till after all the Juices of the Body have been infected; hence we may plainly learn, why they are the wor&s;t and mo&s;t difficult to be cured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated <HI>John De Gorter</HI> (late Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Harderwych,</HI> but at pre&s;ent of <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI>) ob&s;erves in his <HI>Chirurgia Repurgata</HI> (Lib. ii. Cap. ii. Par. 205.) That the <HI>Tophi</HI> or <HI>Nodes,</HI> in the <HI>Lues venerea,</HI> are to be treated in the &s;ame manner, as a <HI>Caries</HI> or <HI>Rotten|ne&s;s</HI> of the Bones; but that no Remedy has been given for the <HI>gouty Tophi:</HI> There is good Rea&s;on in what this worthy Man mentions, for Ointments, Empla&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> externally applyed, do nothing; it being nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to remove the Cau&s;e, and then the <HI>Tophi</HI> will &s;pontaneou&s;ly di&s;appear.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now to the Method of treating this Di&s;ea&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boerhaave</HI> Aphori&s;m. 1270.</NOTE></P>
<P>During the Paroxy&s;m or Fit, I carefully avoid every Thing which may hinder or di&s;turb the Evacuation of the peccant Matter. Therefore I &s;hun bleeding, for the Blood being le&s;&s;ened in Quantity, the Pre&s;&s;ure to|wards the excretory Ve&s;&s;els is likewi&s;e dimi|ni&s;hed; and thus the Matter which &s;hould be evacuated, is retained, whereby grievous and heavy Symptoms en&s;ue &Dagger;.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Wintringham</HI> directs Emetics and Purgatives to be repeated occa&s;ionally, in order to clear the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> of their Cru|dities;
<PB N="15" REF="13">but I ab&s;tain from &s;uch Remedies, for they occa&s;ion a Tumult in the nervous Juices, draw off the more fluid Parts, and de&s;troy their expul&s;ive Power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herm. Boerhaave <HI>Aph. 1271.</HI></NOTE>, whereby the natural Secretions are much hindred.</P>
<P>Medicines that encourage Sweat, and al&s;o tho&s;e that pa&s;s by Urine, make the Cir|culation of the Blood more rapid, and of Cour&s;e the offending Matter is determined in a larger Quantity to be &s;eparated and car|ried off, hence the pre&s;ent Fit will be in|crea&s;ed. It is be&s;t that the Concoction and Evacuation of the gouty Matter be left to the &s;ole Work of Nature.</P>
<P>I would refer the Reader to the 1273d Aphori&s;m of the immortal <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> it de&s;erving a particular Regard, nay even all of them on this Subject are well worth our peru&s;al.</P>
<P>During the Fit, we can only endeavour to render the Pain as mild as po&s;&s;ible, by blunting the Acrimony or Sharpne&s;s of the morbid Matter, and gently helping forward its Expul&s;ion out of the Body. To effect this, I endeavour to dilute and thin the Blood, that the Matter unfit for Circulation, and lodged at the Joints, may flow with more Facility and Ea&s;e. I order a <HI>temperat|ing Powder,</HI> three or four Times in a Day, with a <HI>medicated</HI> Liquor to be plentifully drank. When the Pain is &s;evere and &s;carce
<PB N="16" REF="14">&s;ufferable, I give fifty, &s;ixty or &s;eventy Dops of an <HI>anodyne Elixir</HI> in a large Draught of the above Drink. I never u&s;e any outward Application during the Fit, unle&s;s the &s;ick Per&s;on &s;hould be very impatient and de&s;irous of it; in which Ca&s;e, I apply an <HI>anodyne Cata|pla&s;m</HI> or <HI>Fomentation.</HI> If the gouty Mat|ter &s;hould recoil to the internal Parts; and there attack &s;ome of the noble <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> or Bowels, we mu&s;t immediately try all in our Power to drive it out again to the Joints, with large Draughts of an <HI>aromatic Decoction, Fomentations and Bli&s;ters</HI> too if requi&s;ite.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Herm. Boerhaave</HI> Aphori&s;m 1281.</NOTE> By the&s;e Means many may be pre&s;erved from &s;udden Death.</P>
<P>Out of the Fit, I take Care to prevent the Encrea&s;e of the gouty Matter, al&s;o to &s;hake off that which has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, begun to fix it&s;elf. And for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t the Patient mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve a good Diet, e&s;pecially a milky one, for Milk has been &s;eparated from every gro&s;s Part, having already pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;everal Di|ge&s;tions in the Animal; hence it does not beget tho&s;e Crudities any other Diet is liable to.</P>
<P>The gouty Patient, while he is under his Cour&s;e of Medicines, ought to have the following Ver&s;e in&s;cribed over his Chamber|door.</P>

<P>Con&s;tant Exerci&s;e is directed by the noble <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> and very ju&s;tly too; for Sloth is Sepulchre of the Living; to &s;tand &s;till and be unactive is pernicious; if the Air &s;tag|nates it becomes pe&s;tilential; if Water is without Motion, it &s;oon is putrid and cor|rupt; if the Land is not cultivated it be|comes De&s;ert and wa&s;te; in like manner the Warrior laying a&s;ide his Arms, Ru&s;t and Canker prey upon them; the Mu&s;ician too neglecting his In&s;trument, the Chords of Harmony decay and are u&s;ele&s;s; the Moth al&s;o makes his Inroads on our horded Gar|ments: Thus &s;ings the Poet <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

<P>What &s;ays the old Divine <HI>Hippocrates?</HI> Indolence moi&s;tens and renders the Body weak and flaccid; Labour and Indu&s;try throws off the &s;uperfluous Juices, and makes it firm and robu&s;t.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ea&s;e of Drow&s;ine&s;s and un&s;table Judgment is the Offspring of Negligence and want of Care<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rolfinck Meth. Med. Spec. Praef. ad lect. in princip.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Always to &s;it is bad, for the pancreatic Juice and Bile, which is a Bal&s;am nece&s;&s;ary to be mixed with the Chyle, is by this Inactivity precipitated in the &s;maller Inte&s;|tines, hence ari&s;es a <HI>Cacochylia</HI> or bad State of Chyle; wherefore in&s;tead of a &s;weet nu|tritious Chyle, an acid aquo&s;e Fluid enters the Lacteals.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Ferment in the Stomach becomes acid, which afterwards changes whatever it receives into the &s;ame Acidity, after the manner of the Fermentation in making Bread (for a little Yea&s;t being mingled with the Flour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;oon communicates the &s;ame Ferment to the whole Ma&s;s.) Hence vari|rious Di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Blautus Palinurus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Curcurl.</HI> Act. 11. p. 167.</NOTE> directs a <HI>Cappadocian</HI> (who&s;e Blood had not a free Circulation) to walk, it being the be&s;t Remedy for the Spleen.</P>
<P>Agreeable to <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> every gouty Per&s;on ought to ride in a clear, but not a cold Air: As Chilline&s;s or Cold is the Fore|runner of Mortality, thus a due Warmth &s;hews the vital inte&s;tine Motion, that is &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Life; for as long as we live, we mu&s;t enjoy a more or le&s;s Degree of Heat: Cold is injurious to the Nerves as <HI>Euripides</HI> bears Te&s;timony, where he &s;ays, <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, Cold is very hurtful to a thin or lean habit of Body.</P>
<P><HI>Hippocrates</HI> al&s;o takes notice, that tho&s;e who travel through Snow, or in extreme cold Weather, &s;o as to have their Feet, Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> benumbed thereby, are much afflicted by their Approach to any &s;udden Heat, and have intolerable Itchings, and that in &s;ome even Bli&s;ters ari&s;e, like tho&s;e from a Burn, but this happens not till after they begin to grow warm.</P>
<P>Cold Bathing is prejudicial, for it pro|duces a &s;udden Hurry and Tumult to Na|ture, becau&s;e of the immediate Change from the warm Air into cold Water; thus the Per&s;piration is in a Moment checked, and all the moi&s;t impure and &s;aline Effluvia re|maining

See <HI>Oration.</HI> D. We&s;&s;erhau&s;en <HI>de Diaeta &s;tud.</HI> &s;. 8. p. 5. <HI>it. Zeil. Handb.</HI> p. 11. p. 404. <HI>Zacut. Lucit. H. Ephem. Germ.

<P>The Rea&s;on is that the Body undergoes a greater Alteration by Air from <GAP DESC="foreign">, (Tran&s;piration) or Breathing of Vapours through the Pores, than from <GAP DESC="foreign"> (In&s;pi|ration) or taking Air into the Lungs; hence an <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Ob&s;truction of the na|tural Per&s;piration is the Mother of many Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved that many who labour under Fevers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Spring, if they do not guard them&s;elves well again&s;t the Air, though they may e&s;cape Death, yet are &s;ub|ject to Relap&s;es.</P>
<P>Moreover, the &s;ick Man &s;hould be early in Bed in the Evening, and late in the Morn|ing, as <HI>Boerhaave</HI> ob&s;erves; for Sleep is the be&s;t Specific in all Di&s;ea&s;es, it is a Secret in Medicine more valuable than Gems or pre|cious Stones; and that Phy&s;ician ought to be much e&s;teemed who can a&s;&s;i&s;t the Wants of Nature in this Re&s;pect, with Security and Advantage to the Sick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Croll.
