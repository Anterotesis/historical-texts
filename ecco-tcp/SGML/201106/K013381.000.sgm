<P>THIS little Treati&s;e was at fir&s;t not intended to be publi&s;hed &s;e|parate, but only to be annexed to ano|ther work of the author's, printed at the &s;ame time, entitled, <HI>Ob&s;ervations on Spe|cific Medicines,</HI> &amp;c. But as many may have an occa&s;ion to peru&s;e this part without the other, who would not care to be at the expence of purcha&s;ing both together, a few copies were printed off &s;eparate for this rea&s;on.</P>

<P>All the merit which the author pre|tends to in this, as well as in the other Treati&s;e, is, his having offered to man|kind the means for relief, e&s;tabli&s;hed upon reiterated experience, (the mo&s;t infallible foundation for the &s;cience of phy&s;ic) which will &s;carce ever fail of giving &s;atisfaction to the mi&s;erable pa|tient; e&s;pecially if the rules and direc|tions pre&s;cribed, and given with the medicines herein recommended, are &s;trictly adhered to.</P>

<P><HI>_MASTUPRATIO,</HI> or <HI>Ma|nu&s;tupratio;</HI> Manual Stupration, or Self-Pollution, is a vice hardly to be named, much le&s;s to be practi&s;ed in a country, where virtue, decency, or politene&s;s, have the lea&s;t re|gard
<PB N="12" REF="7">paid to them; and this abominable and unmanly practice is productive of the mo&s;t deplorable, and generally incurable di&s;or|ders.</P>
<P>Providence has implanted in human na|ture what is by &s;ome called, <HI>the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love,</HI> and by others, <HI>the Appetite of Lu&s;t,</HI> for very wi&s;e purpo&s;es; but has given us rea&s;on to re&s;train this nece&s;&s;ary inclination, and keep it within due limits. Every day, however, furni&s;hes us with ca&s;es which evince, that rea&s;on is not always a ballance again&s;t the appetites; for boys regardle&s;s, or perhaps ignorant of the con&s;equences, too frequently indulge them&s;elves in this prepo&s;terous method of venery; and it is beyond a doubt, that many, more ad|vanced in years, who are long immured in colleges and cloi&s;ters, and at la&s;t elope from their cells, utterly de&s;titute of &s;cience, and equally unacquainted with the world and books, are not le&s;s guilty of this enor|mous vice.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>The&s;e by a mo&s;t dete&s;table kind of magic, conjure up at plea&s;ure an ideal <HI>Ve|nus,</HI> and thus never want an opportunity of enjoying an imaginary mi&s;tre&s;s. The frequent repetition of the&s;e execrable plea|&s;ures induce an infinitude of the wor&s;t di&s;|orders; &s;uch as Lethargies, Vertigo's, Atrophys, Apoplexies, Pal&s;ies, Lowne&s;s of Spirits, Hypochondriacal Di&s;orders, Amauro&s;es, a Tabes Dor&s;alis, and the wor&s;t &s;pecies of a Gonorrhaea, mo&s;t commonly attended with an utter impotence as to real enjoyments; be&s;ides an innumerable train of various nervous complaints, &s;uch as are the frequent attendants upon a de|clining age, when the vigour of youth be|gins to wear off.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;orders chiefly derive their ori|gin from tho&s;e univer&s;al convul&s;ions, that always attend the emi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Semen;</HI> and if we con&s;ider the human body, as made up of flexible pipes, and yielding fluids, we &s;hall readily under&s;tand how Convul|&s;ions
<PB N="14" REF="9">wear out the con&s;titution, and pro|duce the&s;e effects, viz. by de&s;troying the &s;trength and ela&s;ticity of the &s;olid parts. And that the extacy which accompanies venereal enjoyments is of the nature of a convul&s;ion, is not hard to be conceived. <HI>Quincy,</HI> in his explanation of <HI>Sanctorius</HI>'s Aphori&s;ms expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, that <Q>"At the time of coition, the fibres are inten&s;ely drawn up; that too frequent u&s;e of this exerci&s;e, cannot but be very prejudicial to health by over&s;training and de&s;troying the force of the fibres"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect iv. Aphori&s;m i.</NOTE></Q>; the natural con&s;e|quence of which mu&s;t be a &s;pringyne&s;s and action upon their contents. Hence per|&s;piration is le&s;&s;ened,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mala a nimio Coitu orta mediate a Per&s;piratione. Sanctor. Sect. vi. Aphori&s;m iii.</NOTE> the fluids run into preternatural cohe&s;ions, and ob&s;tructions are generated. And this morbid condition is &s;till augmented by an exce&s;&s;ive lo&s;s of the
<PB N="15" REF="10"><HI>Semen</HI> it&s;elf, &s;ince the blood is thereby robbed of its mo&s;t pure, bal&s;amic, and in|vigorating particles.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is worthy of remark, that people who are accu&s;tomed to &s;uch filthi|ne&s;s, are not &s;o ea&s;ily cured of any chro|nical di&s;temper as tho&s;e who are free from it; for as <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> &s;peaking about venereal intercour&s;es, prudently remarks, <HI>Caven|dumne in &s;ecunda valetudine adver&s;ae pre&s;idia con&s;umantur:</HI> that is, <Q>"We &s;hould take care of con&s;uming wantonly in a &s;tate of health, what would be our &s;upport during &s;ickne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Semen verile,</HI> is a fluid of the mo&s;t elaborate and noble production in the whole body, except that of the nerves, if &s;uch there be; and it is this vital feed which makes men hot, robu&s;t, hairy, of a &s;trong and deep voice, bold and courageous, and fit to contrive, or exe|cute
<PB N="16" REF="11">any enterprize. Men are a proof of this; whereas they who are de&s;titute of vi|tal Seed, are wrinkled, pale, weak, of a &s;hrill voice, without hair, beardle&s;s and ef|feminate; &s;uch are eunuchs. For we know from experience, when the &s;ecretory or|gans of this juice are de&s;troyed by ca&s;|tration before the time of puberty, as is frequently done in <HI>Italy</HI> to pre&s;erve the voice; or if by any accident a man is de|prived of his te&s;ticles after this age, the de&s;truction of the&s;e marks of verility al&s;o follow, in confirmation of this <HI>Boerhaave</HI> has given us an in&s;tance of fact. <Q>"There was, &s;ays he, an intrepid &s;oldier, who, a&s;piring after the reward propo&s;ed by the general, to him who would fir&s;t fix the &s;tandard in the enemies fort, climbed through the thick battery of the enemy, but unfortunately the fire of a cannon took off both his te&s;ticles; yet he reco|vered, and became at length effemi|nate, not in mind but in body. The &s;trength of the &s;everal mu&s;cles of the genital parts &s;till continued, and no|thing
<PB N="17" REF="12">towards his virility but his te&s;ticles, and yet his voice &s;oon altered, and beard fell off, &amp;c."</Q> But the man who is re|tentive of the &s;eminal juices, becomes bold, hardy and &s;trong, like the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t; witne&s;s the <HI>Athletae</HI> of old, who led cha&s;te lives.</P>
<P>Therefore as the <HI>Semen</HI> is, as it were, the flower and choice&s;t part of the blood and nervous fluid, &s;o venery ought to be only moderately u&s;ed; le&s;t too great an evacuation of this &s;ub&s;tance prove preju|dicial to health. A frequent ejection of the <HI>Semen</HI> requires a &s;ound and vigorous habit of body, becau&s;e it exhau&s;ts the &s;trength, and weakens the per&s;on; hence <HI>Pythagoras</HI> when a&s;ked, when coition was to be u&s;ed, wi&s;ely an&s;wered, <Q>"When you have an inclination to render your|&s;elf weaker."</Q></P>
<P>As venery then only agrees with per&s;ons of robu&s;t and vigorous con&s;titutions, &s;o
<PB N="18" REF="13">the u&s;e of it is principally beneficial to health, after the &s;tomach is empty, and per&s;piration duly performed, e&s;pecially if the per&s;on has &s;lept well, and taken ali|ments of a nutritive quality, and ea&s;y di|ge&s;tion. All the&s;e things are of &s;uch a nature, as to increa&s;e the &s;trength and vi|gour of the body, and con&s;equently to favour venery, or at lea&s;t prevent the bad effects it would otherwi&s;e have. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that it is more &s;alutary in Spring than at any other &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who would often engage in venery, ought to guard again&s;t all &s;urfeits, hunger, labours, exce&s;&s;ive &s;tudies, vene|&s;ections, watchings, purges, and every thing which can in the lea&s;t impair and de&s;troy the &s;trength.</P>
<P><HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ob&s;erves,</P>
<Q><P>"That we ought not too eagerly to pur&s;ue, or too &s;ollicitou&s;ly to avoid, intercour&s;es with the tender &s;ex.
<PB N="19" REF="14"> Plea&s;ures of this kind, rarely indulged, render the body alert and active, but if too frequently repeated, weak, languid, and inactive. And as the proper de|gree of the&s;e plea&s;ures is not to be e&s;ti|mated by the number of repetitions, but by the con&s;titution, the age, and the &s;trength of the per&s;on; &s;o we may take it for granted, with re&s;pect to this particular, that the enjoyment which is neither followed by weakne&s;s, nor &s;uc|ceeded by pain, is not prejudicial.</P>
<P>The day is the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on for plea|&s;ures of this kind, e&s;pecially if they are &s;ucceeded by a full meal; the night is le&s;s hazardous, but even then &s;ub&s;equent fatigue, with long watching, render it improper. It is al&s;o to be ab&s;tained from in &s;ummer, becau&s;e at that time, it is &s;ubject to throw the humours into preternatural commotions."</P></Q>
<PB N="20" REF="15">
<P>But as moderation in every thing con|tributes to health, &s;o likewi&s;e does tempe|rate venery, and every one ought carefully to con&s;ider what his con&s;titution can bear. For a very robu&s;t per&s;on may &s;afely indulge him&s;elf in a degree of venery, which would remarkably weaken one of a wor&s;e con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of a tender and delicate habit of body, and weak <HI>Cra&s;is</HI> of blood and &s;pi|rits, &s;hould by no means indulge them|&s;elves in venereal engagements, without great moderation and caution; tho&s;e who are either too young, or too old, and tho&s;e who are lately recovered from a di&s;ea&s;e, ought al&s;o to ab&s;tain from venery, le&s;t they bring on too great a relaxation of the nerves, and by over&s;training the fibres that compo&s;e all the parts of their bodies, in|jure and weaken their &s;everal functions in the animal &s;y&s;tem, and become liable to all tho&s;e di&s;orders that have been already men|tioned.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="16">
<P>Thus they, who by nature were &s;tronger than others, have, by intemperance, ren|dered them&s;elves much weaker than tho&s;e who were naturally weak; and tho&s;e who were much weaker by nature, have, by their temperance, become &s;uperior in &s;trength, to tho&s;e who were &s;tronger; for nothing renders an animal robu&s;t, but the &s;eminal juice, which is therefore of great efficacy and importance towards health, &s;trength and magnanimity, as well as pro|creation.</P>
<P>But as there are too many, who do not attend to the rules here laid down, &s;o much as would be convenient for them, perhaps the following ca&s;e may be of &s;ome importance, to &s;uch as have not yet utter|ly de&s;troyed their con&s;titutions, by an im|moderate pur&s;uit after plea&s;ures.</P>
<Q><P>"A young man of twenty-five years of age, of a phlegmatico-&s;anguine habit, and
<PB N="22" REF="17">who from his very infancy, had a tender con&s;titution, when about fifteen years of age, learnt of a wicked &s;chool-fellow, the execrable trick of <HI>Ma&s;tupration.</HI> He indulged him&s;elf in this vile and unman|ly practice, very frequently, even al|mo&s;t daily, from the fifteenth to the twenty-third year of his age, and applied him&s;elf at the &s;ame time to writing in a very &s;mall character; by which means he contracted &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive weak|ne&s;s of his head and eyes, that the&s;e latter were frequently convul&s;ed, during his prepo&s;terous entertainment.</P>
<P>Some time ago, while he was wick|edly employed in this manner, and his de&s;ign upon the very point of being executed, &s;ome per&s;on or other unex|pectedly knocked at his chamber door, which accident put him into &s;uch con|fu&s;ion, that the ultimate &s;cene of his di|ver&s;ion was left unaccompli&s;hed. Upon this he immediately felt &s;o exqui&s;ite a pain, and &s;o vehement a ten&s;ion in his
<PB N="23" REF="18">te&s;ticles, and &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els, that he could not walk without the utmo&s;t diffi|culty. The force of his genius, and the &s;ight of his eyes, &s;eemed at the &s;ame time to be dimini&s;hed and impaired.</P>
<P>Though he had the danger, with which this execrable practice threataned him, in full view, yet after the pain of his te&s;ticles was removed, he was &s;o much infatuated as to repeat his crime, and begin afre&s;h his former cour&s;e; but he was &s;oon after &s;eized with the like pain in his genitals, and e&s;pecially in his te&s;ticles, where the pain was ac|companied with a very con&s;iderable ten|&s;ion. By the u&s;e of external and in|ternal medicines for about half a year, he al&s;o got this di&s;order removed, but with &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>Soon after he was &s;eized with a &s;wel|ling in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which go to the
<PB N="24" REF="19">left te&s;ticle. The &s;welling appeared larger than ordinary after his meals, but was not accompanied with pain, unle&s;s, when by his folly he brought a &s;timulus on the parts; but though it was void of pain, it was attended with another very unlucky circum&s;tance, for it remains with him to this very day. To this was joined &s;o great a weak|in his head and eyes, that when he was about to read any thing, he &s;eemed to be drunk, and flu&s;hed with wine; the pupils of his eyes were extremely di|lated, and his eyes them&s;elves racked with darting pains, accompanied with &s;ome degree of ten&s;ion; his eye-lids &s;eemed, as it were, oppre&s;&s;ed with a kind of weight; in the morning they were conglutinated together, and wa|tered very much; but this was not all, for both corners of his eyes, be&s;ides the violent pains with which they were racked, were al&s;o clogged and &s;tuffed with a whiti&s;h kind of matter.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="20">
<P>In this deplorable &s;tate he was obliged to give over reading, and interrupt the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, for the &s;pace of &s;ix months, during which time he only employed him&s;elf in exerci&s;e and re|creation, and in taking the medicines, which were judged proper for one in his condition; by which means he recovered &s;o far, as to be able to apply him&s;elf to his &s;tudies for two or three hours a day, which he can &s;till do; but if at any time he &s;hould chance to protract his application, and lengthen out his &s;tudies beyond their &s;tated time, he is immediately &s;eized with the above &s;ymp|toms; be&s;ides, he was become &s;o lean that his body was little more than a &s;keleton; and though his appetite was good, yet he was indi&s;po&s;ed after his meals, and was affected with a kind of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>But when he got a ju&s;ter &s;en&s;e of things, and had for almo&s;t the &s;pace of
<PB N="26" REF="21">two years ab&s;tained from his former practices, and from all commerce with women, he began to be troubled with very frequent nocturnal pollutions, by which he found his body gradually more and more weakened, and his &s;trength impaired; &s;o that now what &s;eemed principally to be regarded was the re|moval of this imbecility, which was after &s;ome time entirely cured, by the u&s;e of my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, of which more will be &s;aid hereafter."</P></Q>
<P>From this account, we learn, that Venery u&s;ed either too &s;oon or too often, not only impairs the &s;trength of the body in gene|ral, but al&s;o debilitates the noble functions of the brain and eyes, to &s;uch a de|gree, that the lo&s;s becomes almo&s;t irre|parable.</P>
<P>I have had an opportunity of &s;eeing a great many ca&s;es, where per&s;ons well ad|vanced
<PB N="27" REF="22">in years, have by immoderate ve|nery, not only brought upon their eyes redne&s;s, darting pains, accompanied with ten&s;ion, a heavy &s;en&s;ation, as if a weight was laid upon them, and a frequent &s;hed|ding of tears, but likewi&s;e &s;uch a weak|ne&s;s of &s;ight, that they were rendered in|capable either to read or write; and I have found that in the&s;e very ca&s;es, the pupils were always dilated, as they are in a <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> by rea&s;on of the weakened, or lo&s;t tone of the mu&s;cular and nervous &s;ibres which &s;urround them. But why need I &s;top here? &s;ince I my&s;elf knew two ca&s;es, in which a <HI>Gutta Serena</HI> it&s;elf was brought on by exce&s;&s;ive venery, and a long &s;eries of grief.</P>
<P>Hence it appears how great and &s;ur|prizing a con&s;ent there is between the &s;e|minal parts, or rather the &s;pirituous &s;e|minal fluid it&s;elf, and the fabric of the eye, which is compo&s;ed of the fine&s;t mem|branes,
<PB N="28" REF="23">nerves and mu&s;cular fibres, as well as the mo&s;t clear and tran&s;parent fluids.</P>
<P>The lymphatic &s;eminal fluid is almo&s;t of the &s;ame nature and quality with that fluid which is &s;ecreted in the brain, and di&s;tributed through all the nerves of the body; for which rea&s;on, the more plenti|ful the evacuation of the former is, the more &s;canty and defective the &s;ecretion of the other in the brain mu&s;t of cour&s;e be. Hence al&s;o a rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned why tho&s;e youths, who begin too early to ta&s;te the forbidden joys of <HI>Venus,</HI> &s;u&s;tain a con|&s;iderable lo&s;s of memory, and are render|ed unfit for &s;tudy; and likewi&s;e why per|&s;ons farther advanced in years, who are exce&s;&s;ively addicted to venereal plea&s;ure, lo&s;e their &s;trength, and bring on a pre|mature death.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="24">
<P>The rea&s;on of the nocturnal pollutions in the ca&s;e ju&s;t recited, is very plain; for the more copious and frequent the afflux of the humours, e&s;pecially of the &s;eminal matter, has been to the organs de&s;tined for generation, either by the force of ima|gination or otherwi&s;e; I &s;ay the more fre|quent and copious &s;uch an afflux has been, the more the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els are dilated and relaxed, and the &s;eminal juice for that very rea&s;on, flows into them in a greater quantity, and lays a foundation for tho&s;e wanton ideas, and &s;eminal excre|tions, which even during &s;leep affect peo|ple of a warm imagination.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t formidable &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e, is when the retaining ve&s;&s;els are &s;o extremely relaxed, as to permit the &s;emi|nal juices to pa&s;s off upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;timulus, as a lu&s;cious idea, or conver&s;ation with a woman, after &s;training at the di&s;|charge of the excrements, or after riding
<PB N="30" REF="25">on hor&s;eback in con&s;equence of a relaxa|tion. In the night time the &s;ame accident happens from venereal dreams, with a &s;en|&s;ation of enjoyment; and this is frequent|ly attended with a continual weeping, or gleet, which exhau&s;ts the &s;trength of the patient.</P>
<P>The matter of this flux is an humid, thin, cold, colourle&s;s &s;ub&s;tance, called by <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> a <HI>Liquid Semen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet.

<P>A <HI>Tabes Dor&s;alis</HI> is a violent di&s;order, little treated of by phy&s;icians, though ful|ly de&s;cribed by <HI>Hippocrates</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tabes Dor&s;alis ex &s;pinali medulla oritur, praecipue vero recentes &s;pon&s;os &amp; libidino&s;os corripit, febris &s;unt expertes, bene comedunt, &amp; colliquantur.

The &s;ymp|toms which pre&s;age this Con&s;umption, I have for the mo&s;t part ob&s;erved to be the&s;e, an hypochondriacal oppre&s;&s;ion, melancholy,
<PB N="32" REF="27">and too much thoughtfulne&s;s, pain in the back, and often in the head, an aching pain, rolling and hanging down of the te&s;ticles, a weakne&s;s of memory and &s;ight, and a decay of &s;trenght; there is a &s;en&s;e of weight and giddine&s;s of the head, and a ringing in the ears, and as the di&s;order proceeds, all the &s;ymptoms are increa&s;ed, the legs &s;well, as in dropical ca&s;es; in &s;ome, Ulcers ari&s;e on the loins, &s;ome of which are healed, whil&s;t others ri&s;e in their &s;tead. At la&s;t, a violent Cataract ari&s;ing, the patient is rendered totally blind; the&s;e are followed by &s;ome others; as a thir&s;t, an hectical di&s;po&s;ition, an Atrophy, a wa&s;t|ing of the fle&s;h, &amp;c. &amp;c. till at la&s;t the body is brought to the highe&s;t degree of a Con&s;umption; and that very often with|out any cough, or any other remarkable &s;ign of a Con&s;umption of the Lungs.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t common di&s;orders that en&s;ue from the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of <HI>Venery,</HI> and the prepo&s;terous practice of <HI>Self-Pol|lution,</HI> for the cure of which I have two
<PB N="33" REF="28">medicines which I &s;hall recommend; the fir&s;t, which an&s;wers the fir&s;t intention of cure, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;topping of the Gonorrhaea, is my STRENGTHENING ELECTUARY, which braces up and &s;trengthens the weakened and relaxed &s;olids, warms and invigorates the habit, promotes dige&s;tion, and thereby furni&s;hes the di&s;pirited and impoveri&s;hed blood, with laudable and benign chyle.</P>
<P>The other medicine is my RESTORATIVE NERVOUS ELIXIR, which is perhaps the mo&s;t &s;timulating <HI>Re&s;torative</HI> that medicine can produce, and in the la&s;t decays of life, will &s;till &s;upply the vital lamp with &s;ome recruits; it is good in all Languors, Weak|ne&s;s, and Decays of the con&s;titution, for it &s;trengthens all parts of the body, e&s;pe|cially the &s;tomach, when relaxed and di&s;ordered with frequent debauches, and by re&s;toring the o&s;cillation of the fibres, quickens the various motions, and gives fre&s;h vigor to the animal functions. It is
<PB N="34" REF="29">an admirable remedy for tho&s;e who have been in a manner wore out with venereal engagements, e&s;pecially if their plea&s;ures have been purcha&s;ed at the expence of a few &s;alivations, or a frequent u&s;e of mer|curial medicines, and it will revive any con&s;titution that it not quite mouldered into rottenne&s;s. But they be&s;t de&s;erve &s;uch a <HI>Re&s;torative,</HI> who by acute di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as malignant Fevers, the Small-Pox, and the like, have been &s;o broke and &s;hattered in their con&s;titutions, as hardly to be with|in a po&s;&s;ibility of recovery. For in &s;uch it will to admiration repair the impoveri&s;hed juices, and fill again the veins with a warm, generous, nutritive blood.</P>
<P>It is excellent in di&s;ea&s;es of the head, ari&s;ing from a con&s;ent with the &s;tomach, &s;uch as the Vertigo, Head-ach, Sleepy Di&s;ea&s;es, dread of an Apoplexy, Weak|ne&s;s of the memory and &s;ight, and a noi&s;e or ringing in the ears. In Scrophulous
<PB N="35" REF="30">habits al&s;o, which are leaning towards Con&s;umptions, it will be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice. And when young per&s;ons are not &s;o early happy in their conjugal embraces as many wi&s;h to be, and it be &s;u&s;pected from a coldne&s;s, and in&s;ufficiency upon that account on either &s;ide, the u&s;e of this medicine cannot fail to render their inter|cour&s;e prolific, as it actually romoves the cau&s;es of impotency in one &s;ex, and of &s;terility, or barrenne&s;s, in the other. But the u&s;e of it is varily to be indulged, le&s;t with it be kindled a heat that rea&s;onable coition cannot a&s;&s;uage. And let &s;uch as indulge them&s;elves too lavi&s;hly in the&s;e en|joyments, be careful how they &s;pur nature, and prompt with &s;uch helps, le&s;t they run off their life and &s;trength too precipi|tately, for the be&s;t con&s;titutions in the world, wear out and &s;ink under the fre|quent repetition of &s;uch profu&s;ion, as the frequent &s;training any ela&s;tic body what|&s;oever, will weaken more and more it's &s;pring, till it is quite lo&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all the helps of art to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="31">
<P>To conclude. The omnipotent Creator has given us <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> for very wi&s;e and good ends; which &s;eem to be, that thereby we may be urged with a kind of impetuo&s;ity to &s;hun evil, and embrace good; wherefore the pa&s;&s;ions are not bad in them&s;elves, it is by their exce&s;s that they become vicious, when they ri&s;e to &s;o extravagant a pitch, as not to be governed by the dictates of rea&s;on. But we ought to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to keep them within proper bounds, and the more difficult the conflict, the more glorious will be the victory.</P>
<P>We have all a natural propen&s;ity to plea&s;ures; but the&s;e are of two very dif|ferent &s;orts, the &s;en&s;ual and the mental. Sen&s;ual plea&s;ures engro&s;s the greate&s;t part of mankind, while the&s;e few only, <HI>quos equus amavit Jupiter,</HI> are taken with the beauties of the mental. And the rea&s;on why &s;o many run after plea&s;ures of the fir&s;t &s;ort, &s;eems to be, becau&s;e they hardly ever allow them&s;elves an opportunity of
<PB N="37" REF="32">ta&s;ting the &s;weets of an upright con&s;cience, or of feeling that joy, which ari&s;es to a good man, from the moderation of his ir|regular de&s;ires; and being entirely devoted to the gratification of their &s;en&s;ual appe|tites, they never give attention to the real charms of virtue. Wherefore who&s;oever de&s;ires to enjoy this &s;olid happine&s;s, ought to enure him&s;elf by degrees to the love of virtue, and ever carefully to avoid adding fuel to the fire of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Appo&s;ite to the&s;e &s;entiments is that &s;ay|ing which <HI>Cicero</HI> puts into the mouth of <HI>Cato,</HI> as by him received from the great <HI>Archytas</HI> of <HI>Terentum; that nature never afflicted mankind with a more capital plague, than bodily plea&s;ure; the eager de&s;ires of which &s;pur on to enjoyment with ungovernable ra&s;hne&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Senectute. Cap. <HI>xii.</HI></NOTE></P>
<PB N="38" REF="33">
<P>And the re&s;t of what that great philo&s;o|pher has written on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t de|light the mind of every wi&s;e man in the peru&s;al. Wherefore, <HI>Virtue</HI>'s exclamation in <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> is very ju&s;t:
<Q><L>Quippe nec ira Deum tantum, nec tela, nec ho&s;tes,</L>
<L>Quantum &s;ola noces, animis illap&s;a voluptas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Punicorum. Lib. <HI>xv.</HI> Ver. <HI>94.</HI></NOTE>.</L>
<L>Plea&s;ure by gliding on the minds of men,</L>
<L>More mi&s;chiefs ha&s;t thou wrought than ho&s;tile arms,</L>
<L>Than wrath of Gods.</L></Q></P>
<P>But as the due government of the pa&s;&s;i|ons &s;trengthens the mind, &s;o temperance in diet renders the body le&s;s expo&s;ed to the&s;e turbulent motions. And this rule holds good, not only in tho&s;e, who are naturally of a hot con&s;titution, but even in tho&s;e who curb their appetites; be|cau&s;e it keeps them in a &s;tate of tranqui|lity. And this is the way in general to re&s;i&s;t the&s;e evils, or at lea&s;t to dimini&s;h their effects.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="34">
<P>As for tho&s;e who would have us to be entirely devoid of pa&s;&s;ions, and to &s;up|pre&s;s all the affections of the mind, as if they were &s;o many evils; they certainly have a wrong notion of the wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of the Almighty Creator, who has in&s;erted, and, as it were, interwoven them into our frame for excellent purpo&s;es; for they are not only beneficial to indivi|duals upon many occa&s;ions, but even ne|ce&s;&s;ary for keeping up &s;ociety and con|nexions between mankind.</P>
