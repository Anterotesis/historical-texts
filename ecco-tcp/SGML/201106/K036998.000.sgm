<HEAD>THE <HI>DROP</HI> and <HI>PILL</HI> OF <HI>Mr.</HI> WARD, CONSIDER'D. In an EPISTLE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may wonder po&s;&s;ibly, that I, who have been &s;o uncivilly treated by &s;ome who call them&s;elves <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> on the Account of my <HI>Enquiry after the crude Quick&s;ilver,</HI> &s;hould give my&s;elf any manner of Concern about the <HI>well</HI> or <HI>ill Fare</HI> of my Fellow Citizens, but leave them ra|ther to the ancient, and common Saying, <HI>If They will be, let Them be deceived.</HI></P>
<P>I dare be confident, whatever certain envious Per|&s;ons may think to the contrary, you will be &s;o cha|ritable as to believe, that I have no Ends of my own to &s;erve by an Undertaking, in which, though I may happen to plea&s;e &s;ome, I &s;hall, in all Likeli|hood, di&s;plea&s;e others.</P>
<P>The Friend&s;hip indeed of <HI>good,</HI> as well as <HI>learned</HI> Men, (and &s;uch I e&s;teem your&s;elf) I &s;hall at all Times value, whil&s;t the Malice and ill Nature of the <HI>Petulant</HI> and <HI>Profligate,</HI> however <HI>learned,</HI> I have long &s;ince learn'd to de&s;pi&s;e. But what, alas! avail the Smiles or Frowns of the World to an old Man, that mu&s;t &s;oon leave it? And, provided he has a well grounded Peace in his own Brea&s;t, when he
<PB N="2" REF="3">takes that Leave, has le&s;s Rea&s;on to be concern'd at the unju&s;t Cen&s;ure of unrea&s;onable Men.</P>
<P>To detain you no longer, I am &s;atisfy'd you are no Stranger to the Fame this <HI>Drop</HI> and <HI>Pill</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> have acquired within the&s;e twelve Months pa&s;t: How de&s;ervedly, we are now to examine: But fir&s;t, a Word or two of their Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Conjectures about which are various, as the diver&s;e Judgments and Opinions of the Conjecturers have diver&s;ly led them.</P>
<P>Some <HI>(&s;urely without Rea&s;on,)</HI> have &s;urmi&s;ed the &s;ame to be <HI>Mercurial:</HI> Yet, among the Hundreds daily taking them, not one In&s;tance can be given of a &s;ore Mouth, or Tongue, much le&s;s <HI>Salivation,</HI> which mu&s;t at &s;ome Time have inevitably fallen out, if the Ba&s;is was <HI>Mercurial.</HI></P>
<P>Others more rightly therefore conclude them <HI>An|timonial:</HI> Among the&s;e, there are, who pretend to be Ma&s;ters of the Secret, and who tell us, that the Pill is the &s;ame with the <HI>Kermes Mineralis,</HI> of the <HI>French Di&s;pen&s;atory,</HI> made out of four parts <HI>An|timony,</HI> and one of fix'd <HI>Nitre,</HI> boil'd in Rain-Water, and then filter'd: After which, more Water is ad|ded, and more al&s;o of the <HI>Nitre:</HI> Boiling and fil|tering as before; when &s;till more Water and <HI>Nitre,</HI> in the &s;everal Proportions ob&s;erved by the <HI>Pre&s;cript,</HI> are decocted. Finally, the &s;everal Liquors filter'd, having &s;tood to &s;ettle twenty-four Hours, are pour'd off from the Sediment, which being &s;weeten'd by often wa&s;hing, the &s;ame is dry'd, and twice fla|grated with Spirit of Wine.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Praecipitate,</HI> which I have &s;een prepared, comes forth of a deeper Red than Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s, nor will it operate in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity as his <HI>Pill.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hartman</HI> has one more Simple than the former, which he calls his <HI>Sulphur of Antimony,</HI> an&s;wering nearer to the Colour, and working after like Man|ner, both upwards and downwards, not &s;o dog|gedly, in the &s;ame Weight; though it has been given &s;ometimes to four or five Grains.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P>This is made of the fine Powder of <HI>Antimony,</HI> di|ge&s;ted for a Week in a &s;trong <HI>Lixivium</HI> of <HI>Aqua Calcis;</HI> when it is filter'd, and after gentle boiling, a red Powder is thrown down; which being wa&s;h'd, is dry'd, and kept for U&s;e.</P>
<P>His Copier, <HI>Salmon,</HI> &s;ays, this Powder performs all that the <HI>Crocus</HI> can do.</P>
<P>Related to the foregoing, is that of <HI>Beguinus,</HI> which is nothing but the &s;ame Mineral, boil'd al&s;o in a &s;trong <HI>Lixivium,</HI> and after precipitated with Rain-Water, impregnated with the Spirit of Vine|gar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lixivium,</HI> u&s;ed for the&s;e Purpo&s;es, is made commonly of the <HI>Sal Tartari, Calx Viva,</HI> and com|mon Salt, <HI>a~</HI> di&s;&s;olved in Water, and then filter'd, or of the <HI>Alkaline Salt</HI> of Plants; although the <HI>Aqua Calcis,</HI> as above, very frequently &s;upplies the Place.</P>
<P>Again, there is a <HI>Sulphur of Antimony</HI> made from the <HI>Crocus Metallorum</HI> boil'd in the &s;ame <HI>Lixive,</HI> and precipitated with the <HI>Acet. de&s;til.</HI> having the Vir|tues of the <HI>Crocus,</HI> and is much the finer of the two, given in the &s;ame Do&s;e, from two to four Grains, or five.</P>
<P>The <HI>golden Sulphur</HI> is prepared by boiling the Dro&s;s, &s;eparated from the <HI>Regulus</HI> in a <HI>Lixivium,</HI> as the re&s;t; then, precipitating with Vinegar, there falls a Powder of the Colour of Gold, (whence the Name,) which is &s;weeten'd by Ablution in a large Quantity of Rain-Water, and dry'd for U&s;e.</P>
<P>But the true <HI>Sulphur,</HI> according to our la&s;t recited Author, is prepared from <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> finely pow|der'd, and boil'd in a Solution of <HI>Salt of Tartar, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Calx Viva.</HI> After decanting the Liquor from the Quick&s;ilver at the Bottom, filter and incline the Ve&s;&s;el, that the <HI>red Sulphur</HI> may &s;ettle, which you mu&s;t &s;weeten with hot Water, and dry gently; &s;o have you (with this Gentleman) the true <HI>Sulphur Antimonti,</HI> which opens all Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Liver, Spleen, Me&s;entery,</HI> and <HI>Hypochonders;</HI> expel|ling all Humours whatever, or wherever heaped up in the Body, both upwards and downwards.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P>Of this <HI>Sulphur</HI> and the <HI>Regulus,</HI> there is a <HI>Pa|nacaea</HI> compounded, wonderfully extoll'd by <HI>Hart|man,</HI> as a <HI>univer&s;al Medicine,</HI> curing all ob&s;tinate Di&s;ea&s;es, as the <HI>Lues, Lepra, Scurvy, &amp;c.</HI> by the way of Sweat.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> gives us another, little differing from the former, unle&s;s in the Strength of the Lee, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the pouring one Pound of the <HI>Lixivium Capitale,</HI> or the fir&s;t running of the Soap-makers Lees, upon four Ounces of the fine&s;t levigated <HI>Antimony,</HI> &s;et to dige&s;t in warm Sand, four or five Days, &s;haking them well together; then put thereto &s;ome warm Water: After thus &s;tanding to &s;ettle for &s;ome Time, it is pour'd off into a clean Pan. This Ablution is to be repeated, 'till all the browni&s;h Powder is &s;epa|rated from that which appears like the crude An|timony, upon which more Lees are thrown; and the Wa&s;hing renew'd, 'till the whole of the <HI>Anti|mony</HI> is reduced into the Powder afore&s;aid, which being well rin&s;ed from the Salts, is to be kept dry 'till call'd for.</P>
<P>The Virtues are much the &s;ame with the re&s;t, being <HI>Emetic, Cathartick</HI> and <HI>Diaphoretick,</HI> i. e. by <HI>Vomit, Stool</HI> and <HI>Sweat.</HI> According to our Chymi&s;t, this Proce&s;s was u&s;ed as a <HI>Succedaneum</HI> to that, which went formerly under the Name of <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s <HI>Powder.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the abovemention'd, I could enumerate others, drawn from the &s;ame Mineral by the Tor|ture of Fire, as when flux'd in the Crucible to|gether with <HI>Sal Armoniack.</HI> Thus the <HI>Antimon. re|&s;u&s;citatum,</HI> or with <HI>Nitre, common Salt,</HI> and <HI>Charcoal,</HI> put into a red hot Crucible by a Spoonful at a Time; then either pouring it into a Cone, or &s;uffering it to cool in the Crucible, there will be found three diffe|rent Sub&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> at the Bottom, a little <HI>Regulus;</HI> above that, a clo&s;er, or more compact Matter, like the <HI>Liver of Antimony;</HI> and on the Surface, a finer and lighter Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The two la&s;t of the&s;e are to be kept a&s;under, put|ting by the <HI>Regulus;</HI> powdering the other and wa&s;h|ing them apart, till freed from their Salts, which
<PB N="5" REF="6">you may know by the Ta&s;te of the Water; the uppermo&s;t is accounted the be&s;t, being of a fine red Colour, after it has been wa&s;h'd; the middle Sub|&s;tance looks not of &s;o plea&s;ant a Colour, and works more roughly; the undermo&s;t, or <HI>Regulus,</HI> is the &s;ame with the <HI>Regulus</HI> of <HI>Antimony.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e red Flowers, with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Lemery,</HI> are the more Sulphurous parts of <HI>Antimony,</HI> &s;ublimed by Fire, as the &s;ame are precipitated from the <HI>Lixi|via,</HI> or <HI>Lees,</HI> by the Ablution with Water and Vine|gar.</P>
<P>Powder, &s;aith he, and mix together four Pounds of common Gla&s;s, with one Pound of <HI>Antimony;</HI> put them into a <HI>Retort</HI> &s;et in a Reverberatory Furnace, fitted with a Receiver, lute the Junctures, giving a little Fire at fir&s;t, then increa&s;e, and you will &s;ee the red Flowers come forth into the Receiver.</P>
<P>Their Operation, as of the re&s;t, is by Vomit and Stool, being given in the <HI>Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Gout, Drop&s;y, Scurvy,</HI> and other <HI>Chronical Di&s;tempers,</HI> from two to four Grains.</P>
<P>It was the former of the&s;e Proce&s;&s;es (according to Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI>) that Mr. <HI>Lockyer</HI> aim'd at in the Com|po&s;ition of his Pill, by which he acquired a great E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Now whether or no the&s;e Flowers of <HI>Antimony,</HI> thus rai&s;ed by Fire, or any of the <HI>Praecipitates</HI> of the &s;ame Colour here ob&s;erved, (as by &s;ome has been thought,) be the Compo&s;ition of Mr. <HI>Ward's Pill,</HI> is le&s;s <HI>material</HI> to our Purpo&s;e; &s;ince it is, I think, out of Di&s;pute, that mo&s;t of them will do as much Good, and as much Mi&s;chief al&s;o, when directed by ignorant Per&s;ons, and taken by the like, at all Ad|ventures: Although, to deal plainly, when I con|&s;ider the &s;trange Ravage it makes among the &s;olid as well as fluid Parts of the Body, in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity as one Grain Weight, as much even as the <HI>Gla&s;s</HI> it&s;elf, or <HI>Crocus</HI> would do, I have been ready to apprehend it rather a <HI>Praecipitate</HI> like the <HI>Algarct,</HI> though of a different Colour, from the &s;ame Cau&s;tick Oil, or <HI>Butter of Antimony;</HI> which, if fit to be coun|tenanced,
<PB N="6" REF="7">or to have a Sanction from any one in re|gular Practice, I leave all &s;uch, with your&s;elf, to de|termine.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame Time, give me leave to acquaint you of Mr. <HI>Lockyer</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> aforemention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> about Fifty or Sixty Years pa&s;t, there was ano|ther <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who had been an <HI>Itinerant Mountebank,</HI> travelling the Countries, but happening to Marry a Lady of &s;ome Condition as well as E&s;tate, he hired a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e in <HI>Holborn,</HI> near <HI>Grays-Inn-Gate,</HI> and coming here acquainted with a Chymi&s;t, who had been, as he &s;aid, an Operator in Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Elaboratory,</HI> he got a Preparation of <HI>Antimony</HI> from him, like this of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s, if not the &s;ame, which was prepar'd at the Doctor's Hou&s;e, being call'd by the Name of his <HI>Panacea,</HI> or <HI>Golden Sulphur of An|timony,</HI> by which many famous Cures were &s;aid to be effected.</P>
<P>It happen'd I was at this Time the Doctor's Pati|ent, and going often to his Hou&s;e, as living but a few Doors off, I have &s;een his Black bring of this red Powder in a &s;mall earthen Platter into his Study; where his Ma&s;ter weighing it out, would moi&s;ten the &s;ame with a Liquor, and form it into Pills of the bigne&s;s of large Pins-heads, re&s;embling, both in Bulk and Colour, the&s;e of our new <HI>Ae&s;culapius;</HI> Ten of which being put into a &s;mall tin Box, were &s;old for as many Shillings. The Poor, who made an Inte|re&s;t to my Lady, had them <HI>gratis;</HI> their Operation was rough, both upwards and downwards, like the other Dr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s <HI>Powder;</HI> and as <HI>Lockyer</HI>'s would frequently work, according as they met with Con|&s;titutions more robu&s;t or weak, or as the Fibres of the Stomach and Guts were more or le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of the Stimulating <HI>Salt</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the Prepara|tion.</P>
<P>What I would ob&s;erve farther from the&s;e Per&s;ons Remedies, is this, that my Neighbour the Doctor his <HI>Pill</HI> did not &s;urvive him, but through &s;ome fatal Accidents, like the&s;e of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s, was &s;oon bla&s;t|ed; and he fell then upon a &s;afer and more popular
<PB N="7" REF="8">Medicine, which was his <HI>Spirit of Scurvy-gra&s;s,</HI> both <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>purging,</HI> with which he furni&s;hed all parts of the Kingdom, as well as many abroad.</P>
<P>His <HI>Name-&s;akes</HI> Powder kept its Fame longer, and was, I remember, in much E&s;teem with &s;ome Mid|wives as a <HI>Specifick</HI> to forward <HI>Childbirth;</HI> but gra|dually declin'd for the &s;ame Cau&s;e, and is now, in a manner, lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lockyer</HI>'s held out &s;till, and till within twenty or thirty Years pa&s;t, &s;ome hundreds of Pounds, I have been informed, have been annually returned thereby, tho' I have known Mi&s;chief en&s;ue thence. Upon his Death it came into the Hands of Mr. <HI>Fyge,</HI> an Apothecary in my Neighbourhood, and is to this Day, in his Family; but I believe now, with little Emolument or Advantage, to what it has been formerly.</P>
<P>Thus my Friend, you &s;ee the Fate of the&s;e <HI>Em|pirical Medicines;</HI> and how it is po&s;&s;ible for &s;ome Antiquated Ones, after Mi&s;chief's forgot, to come into play again, or be revived; an In&s;tance of which, we have &s;urely now before us, as lately in the <HI>crude Quick&s;ilver,</HI> which was tamper'd with in the la&s;t Age, and brought once more into great Reque&s;t in this; but &s;unk almo&s;t again, by the popular <HI>Eulogye</HI> of the <HI>Drop</HI> and <HI>Pill.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it mu&s;t always fare with Remedies, how|ever powerful in them&s;elves, di&s;tributed without Judgment, or indi&s;criminately to all People, with|out any Regard to the State and Condition of the Bowels which are to entertain them, or to any Cir|cum&s;tances whatever in the Sick, or his Di&s;ea&s;e, fa|vouring or oppo&s;ing their Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Having laid down my Thoughts as to their Com|po&s;ition, I &s;hall next proceed to the <HI>pretended</HI> Cures, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome real Ones, effected thereby, with the Method how the &s;ame may be brought about.</P>
<P>And here, if we duly con&s;ider the Action of the Stomach, or the Force under which the &s;ame is act|ed, during the Operation of a &s;trong Vomit, like mo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Antimonial</HI> Ones, together with that
<PB N="8" REF="9">of all the Mu&s;cles therein concern'd, which accord|ing to <HI>Mathematick Calculus,</HI> is &s;carce credible; we &s;hall le&s;s wonder that not only its own Cavity, or the near adjacent, but the mo&s;t remote al&s;o in the whole <HI>Animal Fabrick,</HI> being drawn into Con&s;ent therewith, &s;hould have their Contents impel'd for|wards by &s;o forcible a Contraction of all the Fibres: by which the mo&s;t rivetted Ob&s;tructions therein, may in Time, be this way opened; whil&s;t the Fluxion of Humours on any particular Part is call'd off: whence Tumours, or Swellings of any kind, may be &s;often'd and dimini&s;h'd; Ulcers di&s;po&s;ed for heal|ing, which before would yield to no Application whatever. Of this, you know, we have con&s;tant Experience in our <HI>Venereal Cancers,</HI> and other corro&s;ive <HI>Phagedaenick</HI> Ulcers, when a Do&s;e or two of the <HI>Turpeth. Minerale,</HI> will render tho&s;e Sores in a few Days tractable, which, for many Weeks be|fore, would not yield to any Topicks admini&s;ter'd by the be&s;t Arti&s;ts: And &s;urely we need not won|der, if by the &s;ame Way of Revul&s;ion, many <HI>Chroni|cal Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> from the heaping up of Humours and ob&s;tructing the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould, by this <HI>Drop</HI> and <HI>Pill,</HI> thus daily repeated for &s;ome Time, give Way; many <HI>Scorbutic, Serpiginous, Leproas,</HI> or <HI>Venereal</HI> Affects of the Skin, clear off; whil&s;t the morbid Matter furni&s;hing the &s;ame out of the Blood, is eli|minated, or ca&s;t forth by this double, if not triple Di&s;charge; fir&s;t by <HI>Vomit,</HI> &s;econdly by <HI>Stools;</HI> when thirdly, the Remainder is, by the Conflict rai&s;ed therein, during the violent Commotion thereof, per|&s;pired in <HI>Sweat.</HI></P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, is the plain and obvious, as well as Me|chanic Proce&s;s, by which many &s;urpri&s;ing Alterati|ons are brought about, and Cures perform'd by &s;uch Remedies: Yet, if we reflect upon the great Hazard &s;ome Per&s;ons undergo, it is &s;urely incumbent upon all who take upon them the Admini&s;tration of any &s;uch, or who may advi&s;e them, to con&s;ider thoroughly the State and Condition of the Sick, in regard to the Soundne&s;s of his Bowels and Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and
<PB N="9" REF="10">of the Fibres in general, which compo&s;e them, and which are to undergo &s;o forcible a Contraction un|der the Operation; as well as that of the whole <HI>Nervous Sy&s;tem,</HI> &s;uffering likewi&s;e under the Shock; and for want of Regard to which, there will &s;ome|times fall out as great Harm, and as much Mi&s;chief, as at others, Benefit or Advantage.</P>
<P>To avoid the Accidents of this Nature, the honourable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> who under&s;tood the <HI>Chymical Pharmacy</HI> as well as the <HI>Animal Structure,</HI> much bet|ter, I dare &s;ay, than Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> pretends; yet, being fearful of the lea&s;t Injury that might ari&s;e by the tru&s;ting to his own Judgment, and tender of Life, when he had found out any Remedy, or had any &s;uch recommended to him, after preparing the &s;ame, gave it into the Hand of &s;ome learned and experi|enced Phy&s;ician of his Acquaintance, to make &s;uch Trials therewith, as might be done with Safety, and to report to him the Succe&s;s; that if found &s;afe and beneficial, they might encourage it, or if any ways detrimental, point out the Danger, or lay it wholly a&s;ide: Nor, as I have been told, would he &s;uffer a|ny one of tho&s;e which go under the Name of his <HI>Receipts,</HI> of which a Collection has been Publi&s;h'd &s;ince his Death, to go abroad, till it had the Ap|probation of one or other of the Faculty, to recom|mend it.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> had taken the &s;ame Method, he might doubtle&s;s have been the Author of much greater Good to his Country Men, by avoiding the Danger that will attend his Medicines, in this pro|mi&s;cuous Di&s;tribution of them to all Sorts and Con|ditions of the People, under whatever Tempe|rament as well as Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>From his <HI>Pill,</HI> give me leave, ju&s;t to make Men|tion of what is call'd his <HI>Drop:</HI> But here, whether he gives one or more, is uncertain, being diffu&s;ed in a <HI>Sack Vehicle;</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly, if rightly under&s;tood, may differ little from that common Infu&s;ion of our <HI>Crocus Metallorum;</HI> at lea&s;t is of the &s;ame Family with his <HI>Pill,</HI> which we need not &s;tay to Scrutinize.</P>

<P>Every one who is tolerably acquainted with the Chymi&s;ts Furnace, mu&s;t know that many Liquids, in the Forms of <HI>Tincture, Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Oil,</HI> may be drawn with this Mineral, which in a very &s;mall Quantity, as that of a Drop or two, however di|luted, will work too powerfully for &s;ome weakly Habits, or tender Con&s;titutions. An In&s;tance of this we have in the Preparation of its <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> where a Cau&s;tick Oil, call'd the <HI>Butter of Antimony,</HI> will ari&s;e, the lea&s;t Drop of which, notwith&s;tanding its Dilution, is not &s;afe to be given inwardly, being chiefly u&s;ed by the Surgeons, to de&s;troy what they term <HI>Proud Fle&s;h,</HI> and to level the callous ri&s;ing Lips of Ulcers: Tho' there have been tho&s;e who (as <HI>Lemery</HI> ob&s;erves) have given a Drop, two, or three of this <HI>Butter</HI> or <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Antimony</HI> in Broth, to cau&s;e Vomiting, which practice &s;aith he, <Q>"I cannot ap|prove, becau&s;e it is too &s;trong, and produces the &s;ame Effects as the Powder of <HI>Algarot,</HI> which is nothing but the &s;aid <HI>Butter</HI> wa&s;h'd in warm Water, whence a white Powder is praecipitated, call'd (but very improperly) <HI>Mercurius Vitae,"</HI></Q> which to &s;ome I have known, in like manner a <HI>Mercurius Mortis.</HI></P>
<P>The va&s;t Subtilty of this Mineral, in &s;ome of its Preparations, is very &s;urprizing; and in none more remarkably, than in that call'd the <HI>Vomiting Cup,</HI> without any &s;en&s;ible diminution in its Weight or Vertue.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e, compounded of the <HI>Regulus</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> I have now by me; which was &s;ent me as a Pre&s;ent, about forty Years pa&s;t, by a Country Gen|tleman, practi&s;ing among his Poor Neighbours, in the way of Charity. This Cup was lent out from one Neighbour to another, in which they &s;teep'd Cyder, Stale Beer, or other Spirituous Liquors all Night, and drank them the next Day, to cure <HI>Fe|vers</HI> and <HI>Agues:</HI> But after two Per&s;ons (for whom it prov'd too &s;trong) were de&s;troy'd thereby, it lo&s;t all the Credit it had gotten; and whereas before, it went by the Name of the <HI>Angelick,</HI> it was now call'd the
<PB N="11" REF="12"><HI>Devil's Cup.</HI> Quickly after, being &s;ent back to the Owner, it &s;o happen'd that I became its Proprietor; who have never &s;uffered one Tryal to be made with it, &s;ince it was in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Operation of all the&s;e <HI>Antimonial Vomits,</HI> is &s;o very precarious, that no Man can be ab&s;olutely cer|tain how they will turn out. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Lemery</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation being very ju&s;t, in the Words &s;ollowing.</P>
<P><Q>"When the Medicine diffu&s;eth it&s;elf &s;uddenly in the Stomach, mixing with the Juices thereof, and there Stimulating its nervous Fibres, the &s;ame is con&s;train'd to throw up its Contents: If it &s;tays longer, or till &s;ome of its Particles are derived to the Guts, the &s;ame <HI>Stimulus</HI> twitching their Fi|bres, a purging downwards happens: They mu&s;t differ al&s;o according to different Con&s;titutions, in tho&s;e who take them; and very often the &s;ame which makes a Per&s;on vomit at one time, purges him by Stool only at an Other; nay at &s;ometimes will move only by Sweat, which &s;hall often en&s;ue both tho&s;e Operations."</Q> <BIBL><HI>Cour&s;e of Chym. p.</HI> 225.</BIBL> With all which, I'm &s;ure you are well acquainted. But there is one Ob&s;ervation; (give me leave to take notice) of this great Chymi&s;t, about this Mineral, which may give us to under&s;tand of how little Service a mere <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> will be to us in our Practice, which is daily contradicted thereby, and that is this; <HI>That the Crude Antimony is dangerous for to take inwardly, or in Sub&s;tance, becau&s;e it may meet with an Acid in the Stomach, that would open its Body, and be the Cau&s;e of great Vomitings to en&s;ue.</HI></P>
<P>What has led this Gentleman into a Mi&s;take of this kind, mu&s;t be &s;urely his Surmi&s;e, that the Natural Heat of the Stomach, bears &s;ome Affinity or Re|&s;emblance with the Artificial of the Furnace or Cru|cible placed therein; by which the Body of the &s;aid Mineral being open'd, and its Texture broken, the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is &s;et free, and enabled to rai&s;e &s;uch Di&s;tur|bance therein.</P>
<P>For my own part (who have given many Pounds of <HI>Crude Antimony,</HI>) I have rarely known it to operate
<PB N="12" REF="13">otherwi&s;e, (unle&s;s in too great a Do&s;e,) than as an Alterative, correcting the &s;alt and acrid Humours in the Blood, and by that Means &s;ubduing tho&s;e corro&s;ive, &s;corbutick Eruptions on the Skin, which have &s;tood out even again&s;t <HI>Mercury</HI> it&s;elf. For the&s;e Purpo&s;es, I <HI>direct</HI> &ounce; &s;s <HI>of the crude Antimony, mo&s;t finely levigated, and</HI> &ounce;<HI>j of the Con&s;. Cochlear. hort. with</HI> &dram;<HI>j,</HI> &dram;<HI>j</HI>&s;s, <HI>or</HI> &dram;<HI>ij of the Gum Guaj. to be form'd &s;. a. into an Electuary, with a q. &s;. of the Syr. E. Suc.

Simpl.</HI> which from the Gum, but hardly from the Antimony, gives a Stool, &s;ometimes two or three in a Day, yet without <HI>Regimen:</HI> And for the <HI>P&s;ora, Scabies,</HI> or common <HI>Pruritus,</HI> I know of few, or none, that excel (after a <HI>Mercurial</HI> Purge or two,) the &s;ame Mineral, with an equal Quantity of <HI>Aethiops,</HI> made up in like Manner, and taken the &s;ame Way. To return whence I have digre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>From this Account of the&s;e Remedies, with the Hazard and Uncertainty of their Operation, and the manife&s;t Danger that mu&s;t frequently attend upon many of tho&s;e who think proper to venture on them, from the Warranty of &s;uch as know as little as them|&s;elves of the Nature of the Remedies they recom|mend, much le&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;es for which they recommend them, and le&s;s &s;till of the human Frame which is to grapple with them, and for want of which many Per&s;ons mu&s;t ri&s;que their Lives. For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I &s;ay, I thought I might do an acceptable Piece of Service to the Publick, if I laid down &s;ome Cautions in Reference thereunto: And &s;urely, the Di&s;pen&s;er of them to nece&s;&s;itous Per&s;ons, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;ame, &s;ince the more Good he can do with them, without any unhappy Accident &s;upervening, the greater Applau&s;e to him, as well as E&s;teem for his Remedies; nor will there be found any better Method for &s;ecuring that E&s;ti|mation, or that can render them of long Continu|ance, which, like others of like kind, palm'd upon
<PB N="13" REF="14">the World for great and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, for want of proper Caution, have, through &s;ome fatal Mi&s;car|riages, &s;oon dwindled away (as the&s;e, doubtle&s;s, will do in a little Time) to nothing.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, I would advi&s;e all <HI>Hy&s;terical,</HI> or <HI>Hypo|chondriacal</HI> People, &s;ubject to be ruffled by any Eva|cuation, e&s;pecially of &s;o rough a Nature, as the&s;e Medicines may produce, or to be thrown into <HI>con|vul&s;ive Suffocations, Palpitations at Heart,</HI> with <HI>Tre|mors on the Nerves,</HI> to be careful how they engage with them: Some &s;uch I have known to &s;uffer from the weak Frame thereof, and the Hurry their Spirits have been thrown into under the Operation, not recoverable for a long Time after.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the&s;e Medicines can by no Means agree with the <HI>Hectical,</HI> or <HI>Con&s;umptive</HI> and thin Habits, under any inflammatory State of their Blood, their Ve&s;&s;els tender, and the &s;ame apt, upon any &s;training, to break its Inclo&s;ures. Some of the&s;e al&s;o I have heard of falling into profu&s;e <HI>Haemorrhages,</HI> or bleed|ing at the No&s;e: And one that I was lately &s;ent for to, &s;eized the Night following the taking one of the&s;e Pills, with a Vomiting up a large Quantity of Blood, to which he is &s;till liable between Whiles, and which, I have Cau&s;e to believe, will be, at long Run, fatal. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, no Per&s;on what|ever, with an over-bearing Heat therein, or Full|ne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;els, &s;hould enter upon this Cour&s;e, before they have emptied them by free and repeat|ed Bleeding.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Such as labour under <HI>Ruptures,</HI> whether of the <HI>Navel, Groin,</HI> or <HI>Scrotum,</HI> mu&s;t &s;hun the&s;e Medicines, as they would <HI>Rats-bane:</HI> The Pre&s;&s;ure of the Parts of the lower Belly being &s;o great under the working of any Vomit, much more &s;uch as the&s;e, that there would be the greate&s;t Danger imaginable of rendering the Malady irretrievable. Dr. <HI>D&mdash;d</HI> told a Friend of mine very lately, he had vi&s;ited a Woman with a <HI>Navel Rupture,</HI> brought upon her by the hard &s;training in the working of this <HI>Pill</HI> of Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Such as have weaken'd the Tone of their Stomachs, by <HI>Dram-drinking</HI> all Day, <HI>Whet|ting</HI> in the Morning, or <HI>Bottling</HI> a Nights, and have brought upon them a loathing to all Food, or after taking the &s;ame, immediately throwing it up again, can be no fit Subjects for the&s;e Remedies: For that, be&s;ides their feeble, if not rotten <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> with their weak and tender Ve&s;&s;els, rendering them liable to a Breach therein, their con&s;tant Retchings, more e&s;pecially in a Morning, which &s;carce any Remedy can bridle, or put a Stop to, will be encrea&s;ed; and an over Vomiting, or Purging, ha&s;ten their Deaths; of which I have had an Account of two In&s;tances, in three Months pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Tho&s;e who bear not this Evacuation, un|le&s;s with Difficulty; al&s;o &s;uch as are ea&s;ily &s;et on Vo|miting, mu&s;t be careful they are not, with the fore|going, over&s;et thereby; for that at &s;ometimes, the <HI>Sulphur</HI> of the <HI>Antimony</HI> adhering to, or being en|tangled in the tender Coats of the Stomach, who&s;e Lining, by preceeding Evacuation, has been &s;cour'd off, is continually &s;timulating to the Excretion: And I could give as many Examples of tho&s;e, where the Operation has never cea&s;ed, till the Sick has been quite run down, and died &s;trongly con|vul&s;ed. For this Cau&s;e, it will be always found ex|pedient, that the di&s;ea&s;ed Patient, before he enter|prizes either of the&s;e Medicines, <HI>(if they may be &s;o denominated,)</HI> be provided with a proper Quantity of Chicken or Mutton Broth, which may &s;erve to &s;heath and blunt the <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Sulphur,</HI> rendering their <HI>Stimuli</HI> more tolerable to the Nervous Fibres; preventing tho&s;e hard Strainings, which might other|wi&s;e endanger the Animal Fabrick.</P>
<P>This you know, Sir, was the Advice of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lemery,</HI> (<HI>Cour&s;e of Chymi&s;try,</HI> pag. 292.) in the fol|lowing Words.</P>
<P><Q>"Broth, a little fat, is nece&s;&s;ary, when the Pati|ent finds an Inclination to vomit, becau&s;e it will render the &s;ame ea&s;ier, and be the Means of hin|dering tho&s;e great Efforts under the Operation of
<PB N="15" REF="16">the&s;e Remedies, which &s;ometimes break the Ve&s;|&s;els, and occa&s;ion mortal <HI>Haemorrhages.</HI> When if, notwith&s;tanding the U&s;e of the&s;e, the Vomiting will not cea&s;e, you may di&s;&s;olve a little <HI>Cream of Tartar</HI> in the &s;aid Broth, and take &s;ome Spoonfulls every Quarter of an Hour: This (&s;aith he) &s;tops the Vomiting, becau&s;e joining with the <HI>Antimony,</HI> it fixes the &s;ame; &s;o that together, they are pre|cipitated by Stool."</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t general Caution I have to impart, leave|ing you to judge if it be not a very nece&s;&s;ary one, is this, That Children, weakly Per&s;ons, and all others, naturally prone to Fluxes of any kind, and who are apt to throw up what they take upon the &s;lighte&s;t Occa&s;ion, not from any vi&s;cid, or phlegma|tick Humours, ne&s;tling in the plu&s;hy Coat of the Stomach, but from mere Debility, or <HI>Atony</HI> (as it is named by us,) of the Fibres thereof, mu&s;t be ex|ceeding careful how they engage with the&s;e Reme|dies, for Fear, as in my la&s;t Caution, of rai&s;ing &s;uch a Storm as may not be laid again, but by the Pati|ent's Death. One &s;ingle Pill (the only he ever took) taken by a poor Fellow, who had been my Patient, for a <HI>Venereal Nocturnal Head-ach,</HI> after a mo&s;t vio|lent Vomiting for &s;ome Hours, produced, as I was told by the Surgeon con&s;ulted, between &s;ixty and &s;eventy Stools, not without the mo&s;t imminent Dan|ger of his Life.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e Cautions, very nece&s;&s;ary for all People to ob&s;erve, who think fit to venture upon &s;uch Medicines, I &s;hall &s;peak now of the Di&s;|ea&s;es for which they have been recommended; and in which, according to vulgar Report, they have been, at &s;ome Times, found &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Here, indeed, we have a large Field to &s;urvey, becau&s;e there are very few, wherein, by &s;ome or other, they have not been try'd, by the Approbati|on of their Author fir&s;t of all, and after, from One to Another: However, among the Principal, have been reckon'd many of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate; &s;uch as
<PB N="16" REF="17">the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheumati&s;m,</HI> the <HI>Scurvy, Pal&s;y, Lues Venerea, King's-Evil,</HI> and <HI>Cancer</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The former, I think, we may readily give up, provided we had one In&s;tance of a true <HI>Cancer</HI> ab|&s;olutely cured thereby. This, I &s;ay, would, and ought to be acknowledged the greate&s;t Gift of Hea|ven to poor Mortals, on this &s;ide the Grave; the mo&s;t u&s;eful Di&s;covery, I will call it the mo&s;t ine&s;ti|mable Jewel of a Medicine, &s;ince the Infancy of the Healing Art; provided at the &s;ame Time, it was found a certain, and withal a &s;afe one.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved to you, how we may re|concile the Removal of many &s;tubborn Ob&s;tructions of the Ve&s;&s;els; how the Fluxion of Humours may be call'd off, for the pre&s;ent, from &s;ome Part bur|then'd therewith; how <HI>Scabs, Blotches, fretful Sores,</HI> and <HI>eating Ulcers,</HI> in this way of <HI>Revul&s;ion,</HI> e&s;peci|ally in tho&s;e who can bear the repeated Shocks, are di&s;po&s;ed to crumble off, and heal; though quickly after, they have broke out again, and &s;pread with greater Virulence than before. But admit the&s;e Cures to &s;tand, I am exceeding doubtful, whether the <HI>Cancer</HI> will bear to be handled after the &s;ame Manner, which I never found would &s;uffer any other than <HI>Lenients,</HI> whether internal, or external; being ever exa&s;perated by a <HI>Stimulus</HI> of any kind: So that the Strength of &s;uch a <HI>Revul&s;ion,</HI> however it may for the pre&s;ent take off the <HI>Tention,</HI> relax the <HI>Glands,</HI> and &s;often, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Induration for a Time; yet, &s;oon after, the old Leaven fermenting afre&s;h, the Di&s;ea&s;e repullulates, &s;prouts a-new, and rages oftentimes wor&s;e than before, at length put|ting an End to a mi&s;erable Life.</P>
<P>What I have &s;een of this Nature my&s;elf, or which has been imparted to me by Per&s;ons of Cre|dit, as well as Judgment in their Profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall now communicate unto you.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Summer, C&mdash;l <HI>C&mdash;r,</HI> from the <HI>W&mdash;t I&mdash;s,</HI> came over to <HI>England,</HI> to con&s;ult &s;ome Gentlemen, as well Phy&s;icians as Surgeons, about a &s;tubborn Sore above his Eye-brow: Among
<PB N="17" REF="18">the latter, Mr. <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;n,</HI> was the fir&s;t call'd in; quickly after he had a Meeting with Dr. <HI>M&mdash;d,</HI> and Dr. <HI>H&mdash;s;</HI> and afterwards (as I was told by the Apo|thecary) Mr. St. <HI>H&mdash;l</HI> and Mr. <HI>S&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>At one of the&s;e Meetings, I was propos'd by the C&mdash;l, but it &s;o happened, that I was put by. At the time of the&s;e Con&s;ultations he was under the Care of Mr. <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;n,</HI> but &s;oon after, at the de&s;ire of &s;ome about the Court, and the Relations he receiv'd of &s;everal as bad Ca&s;es, &s;et to Rights by Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s <HI>Medicines,</HI> that Gentleman was advi&s;ed with, and undertook the <HI>Chyrurgery,</HI> as well as the <HI>Phy&s;ical Regimen.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was under this Per&s;on's Care, he de&s;ir'd a Vi&s;it from me; when I &s;aw his Sore dre&s;s'd, the Ul|cer had &s;pread all over one &s;ide of the Fore-head, extending it&s;elf towards the Temple &s;ide-ways, and was making Havock downwards through the Brow, into the Orbit of the Eye: In &s;ome Places it appear'd &s;loughy and foul, in others fre&s;h and red, with unequal callous Lips, and had the A&s;pect of an Ul|cer truly <HI>Cacooethic,</HI> or what we call of an ill Di&s;po|fition: The whole of the local Medicine, was warm Butter-Milk to wa&s;h the Sore, and the Curd to be apply'd after, in&s;tead of a Plai&s;ter; which is the Gentleman's u&s;ual Topick.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Ulcer lay bare for my View, the C&mdash;l asked me, what I call'd his Malady? I told him, it might well bear the Name of an <HI>Herpes Exedens,</HI> and what &s;aith he, does that differ from a Cancer? I an&s;wer'd, every ulcerated Cancer might bear that Name, yet there were of the <HI>Herpes</HI> kind, which were not <HI>Cancerous;</HI> and that I hoped his might be &s;uch.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ubdue the Virulency of the Ulcer, and di&s;po&s;e it for healing, I propo&s;ed <HI>Salivation,</HI> which he &s;aid he had been under in the Country, but, as I under&s;tood, neither rai&s;ed by the <HI>Unction,</HI> nor continued for due time: I then mention'd my <HI>Cinnabar Suffitus,</HI> and the <HI>Quick&s;ilver Pill;</HI> by the former, I propos'd to gain at lea&s;t this Satisfaction,
<PB N="18" REF="19">that if the Edges of the Ulcer &s;pread not under it, but contracted and look'd better Condition'd, I &s;hould have made le&s;s doubt of his Cure, by a <HI>Sali|vation</HI> rais'd by the Anointing, having le&s;&s;ened his Fears as well as my own of its being Cancerous, which indeed were not ill grounded; &s;ince by his Ob&s;ervation, it would not &s;uffer any deter&s;ive Me|dicine, &s;uch as the <HI>Praecipit. Rub.</HI> his Surgeon had formerly &s;prinkled on the &s;ordid Parts, without be|ing exa&s;perated thereby, &s;o that he had prudently left off the &s;ame, and dre&s;t with dry Lint and a <HI>Di|ge&s;tive</HI> over all.</P>
<P>The Patient &s;eem'd inclinable to the Experiment I had propos'd, but &s;aid he mu&s;t go on a while longer with Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Medicines, or el&s;e his Friends would &s;ay he had mi&s;t his Cure for want of Per&s;e|verance. How long he continued that <HI>Regimen</HI> after my Vi&s;it, I cannot &s;ay exactly; but finding at length his Body harra&s;s'd by this con&s;tant Vomiting and Purging, without any Encouragement from his Sore; the next News I had was from Mr. <HI>J&mdash;s D&mdash;ie,</HI> to whom I had imparted the Ca&s;e, who told me the <HI>C&mdash;l</HI> had &s;ent for him, and that hav|ing found the Ulcer in the Condition I had repre|&s;ented it, he had (whil&s;t Mr. <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;n</HI> was by) de|liver'd his Opinion, that the <HI>Salivation</HI> by <HI>Unction,</HI> might be of Service to him, and probably lay a foun|dation for his Cure; to which that Gentleman a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>After this, having lay'd a&s;ide Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s Method, or fully purpo&s;ing &s;o to do, two Gentlemen of his Acquaintance came to me, in order to let me know they could not be &s;atisfied unle&s;s the <HI>C&mdash;l</HI> was put under my Care; and that they would per|&s;wade him to remove into the City, for the Con|venience of my Attendance, where I promis'd to do him what Service I could, and in the way I had propos'd, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Smoaking</HI> the Ulcer for three or four times, and finding Encouragement, to proceed in&s;tantly with the <HI>Unction.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<P>In a few Days more they came again, and told me, they had concluded upon the Removal of their Friend, to an equal Di&s;tance between me and Mr. <HI>C&mdash;l&mdash;n,</HI> for the Convenience of us both: I now ob|jected a Mi&s;under&s;tanding between my&s;elf and that Gentleman, which he had not rectified in the man|ner I expected; and therefore I propos'd Mr. <HI>D&mdash;ie,</HI> whom the <HI>C&mdash;l</HI> had &s;o lately con&s;ulted, as a Per|&s;on more agreeable to me, and with whom I could Act with more Freedom and Satisfaction: But whil&s;t this Matter was under Debate, &s;ome other <HI>Empirical</HI> Undertaker, who knows, I hear, as little of the Affair as the former, by means doubtle&s;s of &s;tronger a&s;&s;urance of a Cure, than he had from us, has undertaken him; but with what Succe&s;s I know not.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e has been variou&s;ly reported about the Town; &s;ome have taken the Liberty to give out, that Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> has cur'd him, after all the&s;e Con|&s;ultations: Others, of that Gentleman's Friends, that he would have cur'd him, had he gone on; and others again, that I had left him in as bad a Condition as I found him, intimating his having been under my Care, who never &s;aw him more than once, nor pre&s;cribed one Grain of Medicine for him.</P>

<P>Since I had this account of Mr. <HI>D &mdash;ie</HI>'s, I was de&s;ired by a Gentleman to Vi&s;it his Spou&s;e, in one of who&s;e Brea&s;ts, I felt a large and painful Knot, which had lain quiet for &s;ome Years, but by im|proper <HI>Topicks,</HI> was exa&s;perated, and had put on the Appearance of a true <HI>Cancer,</HI> of which &s;he had already been informed; I asked her, whether &s;he had Courage to part with her Brea&s;t? not that I am over fond of recommending the&s;e Exci&s;&s;ions, but it might &s;o fall out, that &s;he might her&s;elf think of it, when by the Increa&s;e or Adhae&s;ion, or communi|cating with the Glands of the Axilla, it was not practicable.</P>
<P>This I found had given Offence, and I heard no more of her, till about a Month or &s;ix Weeks after, when by Accident meeting her Husband in the Street, and enquiring how &s;he did; he told me &s;he was almo&s;t well, by taking Mr. <HI>Ward's Pill,</HI> which unknown to him, by the Intere&s;t of &s;ome Friend or Acquaintance, &s;he had procur'd; and in the working of which, her Brea&s;t broke, and di&s;|charged a great quantity of Bloody Water; &s;ince which her Nipple had been drawn in, but &s;he was ea&s;ier, and the Brea&s;t a great deal le&s;s than when I &s;aw it. I told him I wi&s;h'd a Continuance of the A|mendment, but own'd my&s;elf very doubtful: For this Retraction of the <HI>Tubuli Lactiferi,</HI> or Milk Pipes,
<PB N="21" REF="22">with the tucking-in of the Nipple, is always an un|toward Appearance, and generally &s;peaking, as &s;ure a Sign of a <HI>Cancer</HI> in the Brea&s;t, as the painful Knot therein it&s;elf; and truly by the di&s;tant Enquiry I have &s;ince made, this Truce was but of a &s;hort Duration; the Di&s;temper being again, wor&s;e than ever, the Remedy, by rea&s;on of its rough Ope|ration long &s;ince laid a&s;ide, and the Patient, as I heard but this Day, decea&s;ed al&s;o.</P>
<P>The la&s;t In&s;tance I will give you upon my own Knowledge, in re&s;pect to the pretended Cures of <HI>Cancers,</HI> &s;hall be that of <HI>C&mdash;n W&mdash;s</HI> Lady, whom I Vi&s;ited this la&s;t Summer, not long after Mr. <HI>F&mdash;n</HI> had been to &s;ee her on the &s;ame Occa|&s;ion: I perceived one of her Brea&s;ts of an uncommon Magnitude, the whole Body of which, was one continued Induration, and &s;o very ponderous, that &s;he was forced to wear a Su&s;pen&s;ory round her Neck, for the better &s;upport of it. She was prepar'd to receive any Sentence, I &s;hould pa&s;s on her Di&s;ea&s;e: But finding we were able to admini&s;ter little Com|fort, at the Importunity of a Friend, Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> was con&s;ulted, and gave her (if I am rightly inform'd) the greate&s;t A&s;&s;urance of a Cure, by his <HI>Butter-milk</HI> and <HI>Curds</HI> externally, and his <HI>Drop</HI> and <HI>Pill</HI> internally admini&s;ter'd; nay, when &s;he told him &s;he fear'd by the great &s;tretch of the Skin, the Brea&s;t would bur&s;t, he made very light thereof, and reply'd, no matter, his Medicines would make it whole again.</P>
<P>How long this unhappy Gentlewoman pro&s;ecu|ted his Method, I am not po&s;itive, but have heard, as long and as often as he him&s;elf de&s;ir'd her; at fir&s;t with that &s;eeming Advantage, that &s;he appre|hended her&s;elf lith&s;omer and better able to turn her&s;elf in her Bed; but at this time, now many Months pa&s;t, I under&s;tand, in as bad a State as ever: And altho' under the &s;ame Gentleman's Care, the <HI>Drop, Pill</HI> and <HI>Pultis,</HI> having fail'd him, he now has chang'd them for a different &s;et of Medicines; at lea&s;t the Old in a different Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="23">
<P>The&s;e are the Ca&s;es which have fallen under my own In&s;pection, or have been confirm'd by the Per|&s;ons concern'd, relating to the Cure of <HI>Cancers.</HI> I have heard indeed of more, and &s;ome which com|mon Rumour has &s;pread for Cures compleated: But whether or no they have been really, or truly <HI>Cancers,</HI> or only &s;o reported, remains with me a Doubt.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad if the Author, or his Confident, who gives them out, would be careful to collect a Hi&s;tory of his Cures, more e&s;pecially of this kind, well atte&s;ted, where any Arti&s;t had before pa&s;&s;ed the Sentence of a true <HI>Cancer,</HI> which might very much conduce to the clearing up of this Affair; and we may allow, I dare &s;ay, of nine Mi&s;carriages, if every tenth Experiment in this terrible Di&s;temper has been attended with Succe&s;s. Among tho&s;e I have talk'd with, or have heard from others, the far greater Number, on whatever Occa&s;ion they may have taken the &s;ame, have bitterly inveigh'd again&s;t the roughne&s;s of the Operation, without any benefit thereby.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Cancer,</HI> in the inverted Order I took notice of them, I come to the <HI>Scrofula,</HI> or <HI>King's Evil;</HI> and here I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I have &s;een &s;ome &s;tubborn Ulcers, where there were no foul Bones, better di&s;pos'd for healing, after taking of the&s;e <HI>Pills</HI> three or four times; but they have crack'd, fe&s;ter'd, and &s;pread again quickly after: nor have I heard of any <HI>&s;trumous Glands</HI> about the Neck and <HI>Fauces</HI> thereby re&s;olv'd: here indeed the <HI>Revul&s;ion</HI> is lo&s;t, becau&s;e the Humours in the Operation of Vomiting, are &s;till more derived to the&s;e Parts, as is evident in tho&s;e con&s;tant Tiplers of &s;trong Li|quors, who &s;ometimes from their violent retchings, and throwing up all they take, whether Food or Phy&s;ick, &s;hall have their Faces bloated, when the re&s;t of their Bodies are emaciated and wa&s;ted away.</P>
<P>The&s;e Remedies have been al&s;o cried up as infal|lible in the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> or <HI>French Pox.</HI> Here al|&s;o, as in the foregoing, as likewi&s;e in <HI>Scorbutick</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="24">Affects of the Skin, I have heard of Scabs and o|ther breakings out, which by u&s;ing of the Pill, have ca&s;t off, and dried away, as I have before ob&s;erv'd; but whether or no the Venereal Poi&s;on is this way to be extirpated, as it has been at &s;ometimes by the late <HI>Mi&s;aubin</HI>'s, and by the <HI>Quick&s;ilver Pill,</HI> as I have hinted in my Di&s;cour&s;e thereon, I am alike doubtful: Yet as to &s;afety in the Operation, I mu&s;t give the Preference to either of the two la&s;t; having known (as I took notice before) a poor Fellow very merely de&s;troy'd by the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pal&s;y</HI> is another Di&s;ea&s;e, reported to be cur'd thereby; and for tho&s;e who can bear the Ruffle of &s;uch repeated Revul&s;ion, it is not impro|bable but that Examples may be given, where not only ob&s;tructed Blood-ve&s;&s;els, but ob&s;tructed Nerves, by a pituitous Humour therein impacted, &s;uch as the <HI>Gutta Serena,</HI> which is a Pal&s;y of the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> may be thence di&s;charg'd: In like manner the <HI>Apoplexy, Lethargy, Coma, Carus,</HI> and other <HI>Phlegmatick Soporous</HI> Di&s;orders, where the Nervous Fibres are relax'd and &s;luggi&s;h, with the Sen&s;ation dull and torpid; and where the&s;e <HI>Antimonial Vomits</HI> may be more &s;afely enterpriz'd than when tho&s;e Fi|bres are in a State of <HI>Tention,</HI> and the Spirits more active.</P>
<P>A remarkable Recovery of this kind, Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> has given us, in the <HI>London Evening Po&s;t, Nov.</HI> 7. and continued in &s;everal other Papers, which he tells us was drawn up by my <HI>Lord Chief Baron Reynolds</HI>'s own Hand; but that &s;urely does not appear by the <HI>Baron</HI>'s Letter to him, who &s;ays only, That <HI>he had &s;ent him the Ca&s;e enclos'd, drawn up with exactne&s;s in point of Fact; for which he de&s;ires his Credit may be look'd upon as a Guarantee,</HI> as doubtle&s;s it will be: But it can hardly be &s;uppos'd that if the Narrative had been drawn by him, the Ca&s;e would have been expre&s;s'd as follows: MARY BETTS, <HI>a young Country Maid, Servant in the Lord Chief Baron Rey|nolds's Family, and con&s;tantly re&s;iding at his Hou&s;e, in St. Edmunds Bury, &amp;c.</HI> &mdash; Be&s;ides the Terms
<PB N="24" REF="25"><HI>Emetic, Cathartic, Emmenagogue,</HI> denote the &s;ame, however &s;ign'd by the <HI>Baron,</HI> to have been original|ly drawn up by the Phy&s;ician, or Apothecary at lea&s;t, concern'd; and if indeed in the Manner it is drawn, it was intended for the Information of the Common Reader, great part thereof might have been mode&s;tly omitted, as ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s to them, and that without any way le&s;&s;ening the Cure: If for the In&s;truction of the Faculty, few of the&s;e, I dare &s;ay, will think it &s;trange, that from &s;o great a force upon the Blood-ve&s;&s;els under the violent Streining, together with the <HI>Stimulus</HI> added to the Blood it&s;elf from the Medicine, the &s;ame &s;hould break through, not only the Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Uterus,</HI> but tho&s;e of other Parts al&s;o, as it has done in others, under the &s;ame Force. However, as the&s;e Ob&s;tructions might have no &s;hare in the <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> unle&s;s every Woman thus ob&s;tructed was <HI>Paralitical,</HI> or <HI>Vice Ver&s;a,</HI> every <HI>Paralitiek</HI> thus ob&s;tructed, this part of the Hi&s;tory was &s;uperaboundant: No le&s;s, <HI>the pulling down of the Eye-lids to bring on Sleep, and the lifting them up again, that &s;he might lye awake;</HI> as if either depended on tho&s;e Motions, or that a Man could not Sleep with his Eyes open, which &s;ome do frequently, and others are forc'd to do, from a <HI>Cicatrix</HI> after a Wound or <HI>Ab&s;ces</HI> on the upper Lid, occa&s;ioning &s;uch a Stricture as will not &s;uffer the &s;ame to be depre&s;s'd; or that he could not lye awake with his Eyes &s;hut, which others are con&s;train'd to do al&s;o, where the elevating Mu&s;cle has had its Fibres tran&s;verfly di|vided, &s;o that the Lid falls.</P>
<P>There &s;eems, I mu&s;t own, &s;omething &s;ingular in this <HI>Paraly&s;is</HI> of the Maid's Eye-lids, that upon lifting them up, they &s;hould keep &s;o, and not fall down again, upon removing the Finger. This Part, however, of the De&s;cription, together with <HI>her inability to compre&s;s the Glands of her Eyes, in order to &s;hed Tears,</HI> with that <HI>al&s;o of lifting up the Lip, for the taking in of her Nouri&s;hment,</HI> however inaccurate, were, I &s;uppo&s;e, intended to give us to under&s;tand, that there was a univer&s;al Re&s;olution
<PB N="25" REF="26">of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the Nerves; unle&s;s, po&s;&s;ibly, tho&s;e of the <HI>Sphincters,</HI> of which no Notice is taken. And whether or no a <HI>Salivation</HI> was any Part of <HI>Regular Practice,</HI> or carried any Likelihood of bracing up the Fibres, or invigorating their Tone, thus debilitated, I &s;hall leave to you, and others in &s;uch Practice, to determine.</P>
<P>If we go upon tho&s;e two great Principles, of the <HI>Strictum et Laxum,</HI> of the <HI>Animal Fibre,</HI> and con|&s;ider the latter to be the Condition of it, for the mo&s;t part, if not always, in <HI>Paralytic</HI> Patients: The <HI>cold Submer&s;ion,</HI> e&s;pecially in a youthful Subject, had carried greater Probability of Succe&s;s, than a <HI>Sali|vation,</HI> which I have known to have brought on that Di&s;ea&s;e, but rarely, that I remember, proved its Cure.</P>
<P>We are not, I mu&s;t acknowledge, certain, that this Experiment al&s;o, of <HI>cold Bathing,</HI> was not try'd, among other Parts of the <HI>regular Practice</HI> mention'd: Nor will I que&s;tion all proper Methods taken for the poor Girl's Relief, by the Phy&s;ician, who was concern'd. I will grant farther, all that Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> or his Friends, can de&s;ire, that it was by the Three-fold Evacuation, <HI>Vomiting, Sweating,</HI> and <HI>Purging,</HI> that this remarkable Cure was effected; and that the&s;e were the Re&s;ult of his <HI>Drop</HI> and <HI>Pill:</HI> But with whatever Views this Narrative was made publick, I hope no one, under the like Circum|&s;tances, will try the Experiment, upon an Expecta|tion of the &s;ame Succe&s;s, or run unadvi&s;edly there|on. Let them con&s;ider, I &s;ay, fir&s;t, that Part of the Story, relating to the Operation, and then, po&s;|&s;ibly they may judge it fit only for tho&s;e who choo&s;e the Chance (and a very &s;orry one,) of being cured, or kill'd, rather than drag on longer a very mi&s;erable Life. The Ca&s;e Writer &s;ays, That <HI>after two or three Days Interval from the Drop, Mrs.</HI> Reynolds <HI>gave her one of the Pills, which had &s;o violent an Operation, both as an Emetic and Cathartick, (i.e.</HI> upwards and downwards,) <HI>that the Maid, weaken'd to the la&s;t Degree, by her former long Cour&s;e of Phy|&s;ick,
<PB N="26" REF="27">was, for twelve Hours together, with great Dif|ficulty, kept alive.</HI></P>
<P>A Ca&s;e &s;omewhat related to this, in a <HI>Paralytick,</HI> farther advanced in Years, has been, with great In|du&s;try, conceal'd; where a violent Vomiting began the Tragedy, and after &s;eventy, or nearer eighty Stools, mo&s;t of them Blood, the Patient died upon the <HI>Bed-pan.</HI></P>
<P>If then the &s;ame tender Concern for the People's Welfare, the &s;ame Humanity Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> takes No|tice of in my <HI>Lord C&mdash; Baron,</HI> puts me (and I &s;o|lemnly declare to the World, it is nothing el&s;e,) upon giving them this Advice, and delivering the&s;e Cautions, I hope I &s;hall &s;tand clear of any unrea&s;o|nable, or unkind Cen&s;ure, as well from the B&mdash;n, who recommends, as Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> him&s;elf, the Di|&s;pen&s;er of the&s;e Remedies.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, Sir, to you, it was ever my Opini|on, that private Gentlemen, or others of Fortune, unacquainted with human Bodies, and the Di&s;or|ders it is &s;ubject to, might employ their Charity to much better Advantage, by &s;uccouring the Indigent with Food and Raiment, than by admini&s;tring Phy|&s;ick, e&s;pecially &s;uch as mu&s;t inevitably be attended with equal, if not greater Mi&s;chief than Benefit or Advantage. Whether the good Intention will attone for the <HI>Homicides</HI> happening in this Way, is out of my Province: But if the People cannot be content without &s;ome <HI>Quackery,</HI> it were better, &s;urely, they would return again to their <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> as the lea&s;t hazardous of the two.</P>
<P>Asking Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion, occa&s;ion'd by &s;o notable an <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> I proceed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rheumati&s;m</HI> and <HI>Gout,</HI> they tell us, have been removed by the &s;ame Medicines; of which I can &s;ay nothing, any more than of the foregoing, upon my own Knowledge. It is, I grant, le&s;s to be wonder'd at, if &s;ome &s;trong Habits, with robu&s;t Fibres, both <HI>Mu&s;cular,</HI> as well as <HI>Nervous,</HI> &s;hould, in the like Method of <HI>Revul&s;ion,</HI> with &s;ome others, after repeated Evacuation of the Humours, as well
<PB N="27" REF="28">upwards as downwards, be &s;et free of their Con|finement: But I &s;hould expect the &s;ame <HI>Regimen</HI> exceedingly hazardous to tho&s;e of differing Tempe|raments and Con&s;titutions; the &s;ound Bottom may ride out the Storm, when the leaky founders.</P>
<P>And now, la&s;tly, in re&s;pect to the <HI>Gout,</HI> it has been long &s;ince my &s;ettled Judgment, That the prime phy&s;ical Intentions, are (with <HI>Sydenham,</HI>) to &s;trengthen the Dige&s;tion, and fortify the noble Parts, leaving the Gouty Matter, thrown forth upon the Joints, to &s;pend it&s;elf there: For though, at &s;ome Times, I have heard of &s;uch, who, by the U&s;e of my <HI>Name-&s;ake</HI>'s Powder of <HI>Turbith, Hermodacts, Scammony, &amp;c.</HI> have put by a Fit, as they thought, or le&s;&s;en'd the &s;ame, by di&s;charging the Gouty Mat|ter in the way of Stool. I have heard of others, who, by the &s;ame Means, have brought the Di&s;tem|per upon their Bowels, their Stomach, or their Brains, where, notwith&s;tanding all Endeavours, they have lo&s;t their Lives thereby: An Example of which, I was a Witne&s;s, about four Years pa&s;t, in an elderly Gentleman, who labouring long there|with upon his Feet, was per&s;waded to take one of the&s;e Purges; the Day after which, he grew ea&s;ier on tho&s;e Parts, but was in&s;tantly tortured in his Bowels, to &s;uch Degree, that the &s;tronge&s;t Do&s;e of <HI>Opium</HI> would &s;carce give Ea&s;e: Hence the Di&s;tem|per took to his Stomach, and rai&s;ed as great a Storm with ince&s;&s;ant Vomiting. His Apothecary had given an ea&s;y Do&s;e, as I remember, twelve Grains of the <HI>Indian Root,</HI> and in the Evening an <HI>Opiate</HI> again, which freed him from this new Attack; but before Morning, the &s;ame Matter had &s;eized his Head, when he grew &s;tupid, &s;norted, and fell into a <HI>Coma,</HI> out of which, neither <HI>Volatiles, &s;harp Cly|&s;ters, Cupping, Bli&s;tering, Vomiting, Sternutatories,</HI> or any <HI>Stimulus,</HI> could rou&s;e him. In this Condi|tion he lay for forty-eight Hours, and then expired, through the unfortunate Tran&s;lation of a Di&s;ea&s;e, with which could he have been content to have con|flicted as formerly, &s;ome Days longer, whil&s;t the
<PB N="28" REF="29">&s;ame was upon the extreme Parts, he might, as in tho&s;e he had formerly undergone, in all Probability, have protracted his Life.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations, which I readily &s;ubmit, Sir, to your Judgment, I thought proper to com|municate to the Publick, at a Time when great Numbers of the People, who can &s;o readily come at them, are trying Experiments with Remedies, &s;o often hazardous to their Welfare; and by which, as it may fall out, &s;ome Benefit, &s;o al&s;o much Mi&s;chief mu&s;t en&s;ue the pre&s;ent Method of promi&s;cuou&s;ly taking them, or through the want of proper Infor|mation.</P>
<P>If that which I now offer, or from the Cautions here laid down, I may be in&s;trumental in &s;aving one &s;ingle Life, it will afford me abundantly more real Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction, than the idle Cavils of evil-minded Men, the &s;narling of loo&s;e-Principled Per&s;ons, or the Scurrilities offer'd by <HI>Debauchees,</HI> (who, de&s;titute of Argument, fly to Slander,) &s;hall give Di&s;quiet.</P>

<P>CASE I. A Gentleman of a middle Age, of a very robu&s;t and &s;trong Habit of Body, having no other Di&s;order but &s;ome of the common Symptoms of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> was, about three Months ago, brought to take one of the&s;e <HI>Drops,</HI> and two of the <HI>Pills.</HI> The <HI>Drop</HI> work'd very roughly; but he went on, in Hopes of being made quite &s;ound by this pre|tended <HI>Catholicon,</HI> and took one <HI>Pill.</HI> That carried on the Di&s;turbance, and &s;o &s;hook his Con&s;titution, that he broke out all over his Body; with many other Di&s;orders, too tedious to mention. He goes to WARD him&s;elf, tells his Complaints, and asks further Advice, which was given him, That he mu&s;t take more <HI>Pills.</HI> He bought four more; but upon taking one, became &s;o &s;hatter'd with its Violence, that his under Jaw became paralytick; &s;o that, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Hand, he could not move it up or down: The Eruptions increa&s;ed, and grew trouble&s;ome, in &s;ome Parts leaking a &s;harp Ichor. He recover'd the U&s;e of his Jaw in a little Time, but langui&s;h'd, with vain Hopes, that other Di&s;orders would mend. But the Tendons of his
<PB N="30" REF="31">In&s;teps, and of the Backs of his Hands &s;well'd: He had a general Weakne&s;s of his Joints all over his Body; the tendonous Parts apt to &s;well, upon any little Exerci&s;e, and be painful. His Head grew much di&s;turb'd; he almo&s;t loft his Hearing of his right Ear, and had a continual Noi&s;e in it; his Eyes grew watry, and &s;ore, and &s;o weak, he could not read five Minutes at a Time, without Pain and &s;marting. In this declining State, he fell into a Fever, about three Weeks ago, but by &s;afer Re|medies is recover'd; only tho&s;e ill Effects of WARD's Medicines are not yet removed.&mdash;Tho&s;e who are curious to know this Gentleman's Name, may enquire of the Book&s;eller.</P>

She took a &s;econd, and that was &s;o violent, it threw her into &s;trong Con|vul&s;ions, and brought a confirm'd Pal&s;y upon both her Hands and Arms, &s;o that &s;he could make no manner of U&s;e of them, attended with grievous Sickne&s;s, and Vomiting almo&s;t continually. She apply'd for Relief to tho&s;e in the Phy&s;ical way near Hand, for &s;he was then in one of the Lodges in <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Fore&s;t; but they being unable to relieve her, &s;he was brought to <HI>London</HI> about the &s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> has received &s;ome Benefit here, and is in a Way of Recovery.</P>

Then &s;he went to Mr. WARD again, who advi&s;ed her to take another, which &s;he did the next <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night, being <HI>July</HI> the 10th, this operated no more than the others that Night: But the next Day &s;he was taken very ill at a Neigh|bour's Hou&s;e, and was brought home in a Coach, &s;creaming and crying out of an intolerable Pain in her Stom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch and Guts, declaring to her Friends who &s;tood by, that the <HI>Pill</HI> had killed her. Her Pul&s;e was &s;carcely to be felt, &s;he had cold Sweats, fell into Convul&s;ions, and died about three o'Clock on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning the 12th.</P>
<P>CASE IV. HESTER STAPS, a Waiter at the Bagnio, Charing-Cro&s;s, aged about forty-five, of a moderate &s;trong Con&s;titution, and troubled with no other Di&s;|temper, but &s;ome &s;mall Scorbutic Pimples, which u&s;ed to break out Spring and Fall, would needs try Mr. WARD's <HI>Panacea.</HI> The fir&s;t Do&s;e &s;he &s;aid Vomited and Purged her times beyond numbering, and brought upon her many Di&s;orders; &s;he hoping, that repeating the like Medicine would cure them, took a third Do&s;e; but in&s;tead of curing them, it brought on a violent Di&s;order and Pain in her Head, lo&s;s of Appetite, an inward continual Fever, or Fever on the Spirits, with great Dejection and low|ne&s;s of Spirits, and continual griping Pain in her Bowels. She grew from hence Pleuretic and Pthi&s;i|cal: But more than all the&s;e, the third Do&s;e threw out all over her Body a mo&s;t violent Lepro&s;y. This Di&s;ea&s;e &s;he never had any &s;ign of before, but now it was &s;o violent, that the Scales which came off her were very offen&s;ive: Thus &s;he mi&s;erably wa&s;ted away, and the beginning of la&s;t Month died; which was about two Months, from her taking the third Do&s;e from WARD.</P>
<P>CASE V and VI. JOHN WOOTEN, Aged thirty-&s;ix, and DANIEL his Brother thirty-four, being Pthi&s;ical, took WARD's <HI>Drop;</HI> and DANIEL took one of his <HI>Pills</HI> be&s;ides. They both had the <HI>Drop</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="33">mixed in a Decoction of Ria&s;ins, which they took near two Months, but grew much wor&s;e; and DANIEL's <HI>Pill</HI> bur&s;t a Ve&s;&s;el within him in the work|ing, and forc'd up a quantity of Blood: He died about four Days after, and his Brother JOHN the next Day. They were Chairmen in Lumley-Court, in the Strand.</P>
<P>CASE VII. Mr. T. KING, Baker in St. Giles's, about forty Years old, was Con&s;umptive, but with the Direction of an eminent Phy&s;ician, grew better. He took one of WARD's <HI>Pills</HI> the twenty-third of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, which vomited him for three Days, then turned downward, and purged him as much, till it brought a quantity of Blood with his Stools; and the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> he died.</P>
<P>CASE VIII. SAMUEL GRAY, middle Aged, be|ing ill of a Con&s;umption, in the Pari&s;h Work-hou&s;e of St. George Hanover-Square, would needs take WARD's Medicine; he died within an Hour after taking the &s;econd Do&s;e.</P>
<P>CASE IX. MARCUM CAMBEL, about forty Years old, of Patin-&s;treet, Hanover-Square, having an Ague, took &s;ix Do&s;es of WARD's Medicine; but was made &s;o ill by them, that being &s;ent three Days after to the Infirmary at Hyde-Park-Corner, he could not there be relieved, but died in five Days.</P>
<P>CASE X. Mrs. MAGEE's Daughter, of Car|naby-Market, about five Years of Age, was only ill of a Ra&s;h, took three Do&s;es, and died the next Morning after taking the third Do&s;e; it never Ope|rating with her.</P>
<P>CASE XI. ANNE EVING, Servant to Mr. BURTON, of Conduit-&s;treet, about thirty Years old, had only Scrophulous Tumours on her Neck, took five Do&s;es of WARD's Medicines, and died two Days after taking the la&s;t Do&s;e.</P>
<P>CASE XII. Mrs. GILBERT, who kept the Hor&s;e&s;hoe Ale-hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet, of a middle Age and robu&s;t Con&s;titution, took one of WARD's <HI>Pills</HI> the beginning of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t; it vomited her thirty-four, and purged her twenty-two times. She &s;ent
<PB N="33" REF="34">for an eminent Phy&s;ician and Apothecary the next Day, who found her very feveri&s;h, and thir&s;ty, having continual retchings to Vomit, violent Pains in her Belly; and to be &s;hort, with all the Symptoms of Bowels a mortifying; and, what was almo&s;t as bad, the Operation had cau&s;ed a violent Navel Rupture. The Phy&s;ician u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Endeavours to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, but could get nothing to pa&s;s through her, but on the Morrow-night, &s;he mi&s;erably died.</P>
<P>To the foregoing, give me leave to add the two following.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, in di&s;cour&s;ing of the <HI>Pal|&s;y,</HI> a Ca&s;e indu&s;triou&s;ly conceal'd, and notwith&s;tand|ing all the Application and Intere&s;t I could make, have been denied Admittance, to the Widow of the Decea&s;ed. Thus much upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn A&s;&s;u|rance, that no Names &s;hould ever be brought upon the Stage, I have gather'd from a Relation to the Family; that about the middle of la&s;t Month, the Brother of the Decea&s;ed, having read in the publick Papers, of a great Cure of a <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> per&s;waded him to take one of the&s;e <HI>Pills;</HI> When I asked what Condition he was in at that time? they &s;aid he had a <HI>Pal&s;y</HI> on one &s;ide, under which he labour'd &s;everal Years: That in four Hours, after taking of the <HI>Pill,</HI> he was &s;eiz'd with a violent Vomiting, and could not keep from the Clo&s;e-&s;tool, till he fell off in a Fit; that they then laid him on the Bed, with the Pan under him, where he lay in cold Sweats, and very great Agonies; the Stools continuing to run from him, till he lo&s;t all Sen&s;e, and fell into Convul|&s;ions; his Jaws lock'd up, and all his Limbs con|tracted; in which Po&s;ture he died the &s;ame Evening.</P>
<P>I now enquired, What <HI>Report</HI> the <HI>Searchers</HI> had made upon &s;o violent a Death, and &s;o evidently brought on, by the Poi&s;on he had taken? and re|ceived for An&s;wer, That they &s;uppo&s;ed it was re|turn'd <HI>Convul&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Whence Sir, it &s;eems plain to me, that whil&s;t the&s;e poor Women, employ'd as <HI>Searchers,</HI> either ig|norantly, or through Corruption, pa&s;s by &s;uch mi&s;e|rable
<PB N="34" REF="35">Deaths, we &s;hall never be able to come at the tenth part of the&s;e Mi&s;carages: To detect which, I think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that every <HI>Pari&s;h Clark,</HI> lay the &s;tricte&s;t Injunction upon the&s;e Crea|tures, to make a true Report of all tho&s;e immedi|ately en&s;uing the taking of the&s;e Medicines, where they can come to under&s;tand, that any &s;uch had been given the &s;ame or the Day or two before; and that the&s;e Symptoms of violent Vomitings or Fluxes have in&s;tantly de&s;troyed the decea&s;ed Per&s;on. If this tru&s;t had been duly executed, I que&s;tion whe|ther we &s;hould have had one Weekly Bill, the&s;e three or four Months pa&s;t, wherein there might not have been in&s;erted among the <HI>Accidents; Poi&s;on'd by the Drop and Pill.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>If a Per&s;on voluntarily or with De&s;ign of de&s;troying him&s;elf, takes <HI>Poi&s;on (and the&s;e Pills we &s;ee will do the &s;ame Execution)</HI> he is deem'd a <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> and an <HI>Inque&s;i</HI> mu&s;t &s;it upon the Body; nay, if by Mi&s;|take or Accident he is de&s;troyed the &s;ame way, yet &s;till there mu&s;t be the &s;ame Enquiry. Why then &s;hould &s;o many of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects be thus hur|ried out of the World, and no notice taken, for that &s;ome others have &s;truggled and got the better, as well of the &s;aid Poi&s;on, as the Di&s;ca&s;e &s;ometimes, for which it was taken.</P>
<P>You very well know, that every Member of the College, is Sworn to pre&s;ent what is ju&s;tly denomi|nated by us <HI>Mala Praxis;</HI> dear Doctor, tell me what is this? but as the Gentlemen of the Faculty care not to turn <HI>Informers,</HI> neither the Governing Part of the College to take Cognizance yet a while thereof; &s;o po&s;&s;ibly, the Government it&s;elf, may in time, &s;ee Cau&s;e to enquire into an Affair of &s;o great Moment, and either wholly &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;tribu|tion of the&s;e dangerous <HI>Druggs,</HI> among the People, or take Care to &s;ee, that they are placed under a better Regulation.</P>
<P>About ten Days pa&s;t, a Gentleman, in Company with his Wife, having &s;ome tetteri&s;h Eruptions on her Skin, con&s;ulted with Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> who made no
<PB N="35" REF="36">Doubt of curing her in Time, if &s;he pur&s;ued his Directions. When &s;he objected the Weakne&s;s of her Con&s;titution, unable to undergo the Operation of any rough Medicines, he did a&s;&s;ure her, that he would order nothing which the weake&s;t Per&s;on might not venture on with the greate&s;t Safety, and gave her, at that Time, two of his <HI>Drops,</HI> that is, the &s;ame Number of his <HI>Sack Draughts,</HI> one of which &s;he took on the <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning following, without other Effect, than a little Sickne&s;s and Vomiting. On the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> &s;he took the other, with as &s;mall Di&s;turbance as the fir&s;t. On the next Day, which was <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> &s;he went again to Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> who now gave her two of his <HI>Pills,</HI> the one of which &s;he &s;wallow'd the next Morning, <HI>viz.</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day;</HI> this had as little Effect as the Draughts, but at Night &s;he found her&s;elf &s;well'd, as if &s;he had been poi&s;on'd, which indeed &s;he was: However, on the <HI>Friday</HI> &s;he lay by, continuing thus full, and pain'd in her Bowels. On the <HI>Saturday</HI> &s;he ventured on her &s;econd <HI>Pill,</HI> in hopes that might work off the re&s;t, when by Noon &s;he was taken with enormous Vomiting and Purging at the &s;ame Time, which, after &s;ome Hours Continuance, threw her into &s;trong Convul&s;ions; &s;o that &s;he lo&s;t her Sen&s;es, and &s;eem'd as one dead to the A&s;&s;i&s;tants round about. The Apothecary was call'd, and her Husband propo&s;ed a Phy&s;ician; but he told them, the whole Stre&s;s lay upon getting down what Quantities they could of &s;mall Broths, or other dilating Liquors, which might wa&s;h off the poi&s;onous Salts, and defend her Bowels from a Mortification thereby.</P>
<P>In this Condition &s;he continued all Night; her Fainting and Convul&s;ions often returning; and fre|quently no Pul&s;e, or other Signs of Life. The Day following, &s;he came a little to her&s;elf; yet is not, at this Time, free from the malign Impre&s;&s;ion left upon her Nerves by the Poi&s;on, being &s;till, upon the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion, &s;ubject to the convul&s;ive Moti|ons; nor, po&s;&s;ibly, may &s;he &s;uddenly, if ever, get clear from the &s;ame.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e Relations, I could have the Opportunity of letting my&s;elf only into the Mis|fortune of a Family, which mu&s;t, it &s;eems, remain &s;ecreted from the World, under a Pretext of pre|venting the &s;urviving Brother running out of his Sen&s;es, who was in&s;trumental in procuring and giving the fatal Pill, if the &s;ame were to be made publick. In this la&s;t, though I am forbid the Pub|lication of Names, yet I have Leave given to &s;end any Gentleman or Lady of Reputation, who doubts the Truth of the Narrative, to the Hou&s;e, where the Husband will confirm it, as well as the Gentle|woman her&s;elf, who underwent the cruel Symptoms, and who has &s;o narrowly e&s;caped with Life.</P>
<P>To the&s;e In&s;tances it may be objected, that many Hundreds of People have taken, and are daily de|vouring, the&s;e Draughts and Pills, without the&s;e mi&s;chievous Accidents. To which may be an&s;we|red, That the &s;ame Number might very likely take <HI>Ar&s;nick</HI> in that Do&s;e, with as little Complaint: It is not every one who takes ten times as much, that can di&s;patch them&s;elves thereby, as they had intended. Either &s;ome Quantity of Liquor al|ready in the Stomach, or pour'd down immediately after, di&s;&s;olving and diffu&s;ing the Cau&s;tick Salts, Nature rou&s;ing by &s;trong Efforts, throws up by Vomit, <HI>(as in the&s;e Ca&s;es,)</HI> what lies therein, di&s;|charging, at the &s;ame Time, (however, with horrid Gripings,) what is pa&s;&s;ed lower, by the way of Stool, and at length frees her&s;elf therefrom, though much weaken'd, and almo&s;t &s;pent. Thus I &s;ay, (and I doubt not, you will join I&s;&s;ue with me,) that it is po&s;&s;ible for many, by the Strength of a good Con&s;titution, or &s;ome lucky Incident in their Fa|vour, to e&s;cape the&s;e Symptoms, and to &s;uffer little otherwi&s;e than under common Vomiting and Purge|ing from a rough Medicine, of a different Tribe: But, indeed, it is &s;o very difficult to come at all which have fallen out in this Way, that it may be made a Que&s;tion, whether the one hundredth Part is brought to Light; the People who have been
<PB N="37" REF="38">impo&s;ed on, being a&s;hamed of their Credulity, in li&s;tening with the Herd after them, have &s;tifled all they can: And unle&s;s they have been de&s;troy'd out|right, which too, you &s;ee has been the Ca&s;e, their Friends care not it &s;hould be known, but endeavour what they can to conceal them. Had this been the Fate of a great Man's Servant, (and &s;urely, nothing could be more near,) &s;he al&s;o had, in all Likelihood, died &s;imply, as &s;ome others, of Convul&s;ions, with|out an Inque&s;t: And why it &s;hould be made an Ex|ample (as it was) for others to imitate, is, I own, above my Comprehen&s;ion. But the Nature of the&s;e Medicaments will better appear from the following more certain Account of their Compo&s;ition, as the &s;ame is reported to have been communicated by the <HI>French</HI> King's Phy&s;ician; the Original of which is at this Time, I hear, or was very lately, in the Cu&s;tody of that worthy, and very learned Man, Dr. <HI>P&mdash;t.</HI></P>
