<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the Vaccine matter, with which the inoculations have been carried on in the Ho&s;pital, was contaminated with that of the Variolous, and that a hybrid di&s;ea&s;e has in con&s;equence been propagated, not only by me, but al&s;o by others, who have been &s;upplied with that matter, is a charge which I know to be unfounded, and which it was my duty to refute.</P>
<P>The performance of this ta&s;k has, however, been very painful to me, from being unable to avoid a certain degree of recrimination, which attaches to a man, for whom I have long entertained a friendly regard, and to whom the public is under the great obligation of having been made acquainted with a di&s;covery which promi&s;es the mo&s;t important benefits to &s;ociety.</P>

<PB REF="3">
<P>I FEEL my&s;elf impelled to addre&s;s the public a &s;econd time on the &s;ubject of the inoculation for the Cow-pock, not only becau&s;e an enlarged experience of it has now enabled me to produce more deci&s;ive evidence of its advantages, but becau&s;e &s;ome remarks upon my practice of this new inoculation have lately been made, which call upon me for an immediate reply.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t it will be generally acknowledged, that the ob&s;ervations and opinions formerly adduced by me on this &s;ubject, are &s;trictly impartial and unprejudiced; al&s;o, that the facts on which they are founded, have been
<PB N="2" REF="4">related without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, and with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous fidelity: notwith&s;tanding, my conclu&s;ions in re&s;pect to a point of con&s;ider|able importance have been oppo&s;ed in a man|ner which I deem wholly unwarrantable. I allude to the pu&s;tular eruptions which appeared on more than half the patients fir&s;t inoculated for the Cow-pock, under my direction; Dr. Jenner, in a late publication,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his continuation of facts and ob&s;ervations relating to the variolae vaccinae.</NOTE> having main|tained that tho&s;e pu&s;tules could only proceed from variolous matter, introduced by inocula|tion into the con&s;titution along with that of the vaccine. That objections would be made to this effect might be fore&s;een, and they were accordingly anticipated in my <HI>Reports,</HI> where &s;everal facts and arguments are brought for|ward to prove, that all the ca&s;es which I had repre&s;ented as ca&s;es of Cow-pox, were pro|duced
<PB N="3" REF="5">from the inoculation of the matter of that di&s;ea&s;e, uncontaminated with any other. Having done this in a manner which has generally been deemed &s;atisfactory, I did not now expect that any gentleman would pub|lickly attempt to &s;ubvert my conclu&s;ion with|out fir&s;t doing me the ju&s;tice to &s;how, that the rea&s;ons on which it was founded were defective or fallacious. Although I have been di&s;appointed in this expectation, yet as I have no other object in view than a di&s;covery of the truth, I will fully &s;tate all the rea&s;ons which the ingenious inventor of the new ino|culation has advanced in &s;upport of a contrary opinion. He fir&s;t enters upon the con&s;idera|tion of pu&s;tules at page 7, where he &s;ays, <Q>"When I con&s;ider the great number of ca&s;es of ca&s;ual inoculation immediately from cows, which have from time to time pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to my ob&s;ervation, and
<PB N="4" REF="6">the many &s;imilar in&s;tances which have been communicated to me by medical gentlemen in this neighbourhood: when I con&s;ider too, that the matter with which my inocu|lations were conducted in the years 1797, 1798, and 1799, was taken from different cows, and that in no in&s;tance any thing like a variolous pu&s;tule appeared, I cannot feel di&s;po&s;ed to imagine that eruptions, &s;imilar to tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Dr. Woodville, have ever been produced by the <HI>pure uncontami|nated Cow-pox virus:</HI> on the contrary, I do &s;uppo&s;e that tho&s;e which the Doctor &s;peaks of originated in the action of vario|lous matter which crept into the con&s;titution with the vaccine: and this, I pre&s;ume, hap|pened from the inoculation of a great num|ber of the patients with variolous matter, (&s;ome on the third, others on the fifth day) after the vaccine had been applied; and it
<PB N="5" REF="7">&s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the matter thus propagated became the &s;ource of future ino|culations in the hands of many medical gentlemen, who appeared to have been pre|viou&s;ly unacquainted with the nature of the Cow-pox."</Q></P>
<P>Were I to allow the above ob&s;ervations all the force which the author of them could rea&s;onably expect, they would &s;till amount to no more than negative proof, and conjectural inference again&s;t the evidence of po&s;itive facts. It mu&s;t, however, be remembered, that the Cow-pox, as ca&s;ually produced by milking infected cows, differs con&s;iderably from that which is the effect of a regular ino|culation; the local affection in the former ca&s;e con&s;tantly exhibits a deep blue colour, an appearance which the inoculated di&s;ea&s;e never a&s;&s;umes. The Cows al&s;o, according to Dr. Jenner's own &s;tatement, readily communicate
<PB N="6" REF="8">the infection to the per&s;ons who milk them, although &s;uch per&s;ons have undergone the Small-pox.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical and Phy&s;ical Journal, v. i. p. 213.</NOTE> Dr. Pear&s;on, on the other hand, has informed us, that he made numerous trials to give the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e, by inoculation, to tho&s;e who had previou&s;ly received the Small-pox, but that all his attempts proved ineffec|tual. Therefore any arguments wholly founded upon the &s;trict analogy between the inoculated and ca&s;ual Cow-pox, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>From the manner in which Dr. Jenner has referred to the inoculations conducted by him during the years 1797, 1798, and 1799, the reader may be led to infer, that his experience had been &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive to equal mine. But it appears, from his publication in the &s;ummer of 1798,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Jenner's Continuation of facts, &amp;c. p. 12.</NOTE> that his practice had not
<PB N="7" REF="9">then extended to more than eight ca&s;es, and no opportunity to inoculate the Cow-pox was offered to him again till he obtained from me matter for the purpo&s;e in February 1799. With this matter, which the Doctor now reprobates as the contaminated &s;ource of pu&s;tules, he inoculated twenty per&s;ons, and in a letter to me at that time &s;aid, <Q>"The ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and termination of the pu&s;tule created by <HI>this virus</HI> on the arm, was exactly that of the true uncontaminated Cow-pox."</Q> This <HI>virus,</HI> however, which Dr. Jenner from his own experience declared to be &s;o perfectly pure and genuine, was taken from the arm of an ho&s;pital patient, who had 310 pu&s;tules, all of which &s;uppurated. On what ground then can he &s;ay, <Q>"I cannot feel di&s;po&s;ed to imagine that eruptions &s;imilar to tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Dr. Woodville, have ever been produced by the pure uncontaminated Cow-pox virus."</Q></P>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>As a farther evidence of the genuinene&s;s of the Cow-pox matter which I &s;ent to Dr. Jenner, I have the te&s;timony of Dr. Mar&s;hall, who procured &s;ome of it from the per&s;ons inoculated by Dr. Jenner, and in the cour&s;e of five weeks extended its effects in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire to 107 per&s;ons, all of whom underwent the inocula|tion in the mo&s;t favourable manner, nor did any pu&s;tules that &s;uppurated appear in a &s;ingle in&s;tance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Jenner, l. c. p. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Jenner, in his la&s;t publication, has given a tran&s;cript of a great part of Dr. Mar&s;hall's letter, in which the above 107 ca&s;es are &s;tated; but he does not repre&s;ent the&s;e ca&s;es as the effect of the vaccine matter &s;ent by me from the Ho&s;pital; on the contrary, he profe&s;&s;es to lay Dr. M's communication before his readers, to &s;how the re&s;ult of the inoculation in par|ticular with the matter which he procured
<PB N="9" REF="11">from a cow at Mr. Clark's farm, at Kenti&s;h Town.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very &s;triking mi&s;repre&s;entation here pointed out mu&s;t undoubtedly have ari&s;en from &s;ome inadvertency, for tho&s;e who are mo&s;t acquainted with Dr. Jenner will, I am &s;ure, be the la&s;t to &s;u&s;pect that he would willingly di&s;gui&s;e the truth to &s;erve any purpo&s;e whatever. That I have not here mi&s;tated what the Doctor has &s;aid will appear from the following paragraph, in|troductory to the letter above referred to.
<P><Q>"One experiment, tending to elucidate the point under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I had my&s;elf an opportunity of in&s;tituting. On the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being po&s;&s;ible, that the Cow which ranges over the fertile meadows in the vale of Glouce&s;ter, might generate a virus, differing in &s;ome re&s;pects in its qualities from that produced by the animal artificially pampered for the production of milk for the Metropolis, I procured, during my re&s;idence there in the &s;pring, &s;ome Cow-pock virus, from a cow at one of the London milk|farms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was taken by Mr. Tanner, then a Student at the Veterinary College, from a Cow at Mr. Clark's farm, at Kenti&s;h Town.</NOTE> It was immediately conveyed into Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, to Dr. Mar&s;hall, who was then exten&s;ively engaged in the inoculation of the Cow-pox; the general re&s;ult of which, and of the inoculation in particular with this matter, I &s;hall lay before my readers in the following communication from the Doctor."</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Jenner's Continuation of Facts and Ob&s;ervations relative to the Variolae vaccinae, p. 11.</NOTE></P></NOTE></P>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<P>Now it is very extraordinary, but certainly a truth, that Dr. Jenner did not even obtain the matter from Clark's cow till after the date of Dr. M's letter, which is &s;aid to contain an account of its effects by inoculation. Nor does Dr. Mar&s;hall mention the matter received by him from Dr. J. till he had inoculated 423 per&s;ons, when in a po&s;t&s;cript to the letter, giving a detail of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e inocula|tions, he &s;ays, <Q>"I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that of the patients I inoculated, and enumerated in my letter, one hundred and twenty-&s;even were infected with the matter you &s;ent me from the London cow. I di&s;covered no di&s;&s;imilarity of &s;ymptoms in the&s;e ca&s;es from tho&s;e which I inoculated from the matter procured in this county: no pu&s;tules oc|curred, except in one or two ca&s;es, where a &s;ingle one appeared on the inoculated
<PB N="11" REF="13">arm: no difference was apparent in the local inflammation."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Jenner, l. c. p. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here the whole of what Dr. Mar&s;hall has &s;aid militates mo&s;t pointedly again&s;t the opi|nion of Dr. Jenner, who in the above citation is plainly told, that the effects of the matter which he conveyed to Dr. M. differed in no re&s;pect from that which had been employed before, and which was &s;ent from the Inocula|tion Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Dr. Jenner has not only given an opinion, that the vaccine matter u&s;ed by me at the Ho&s;pital was <HI>variolated,</HI> but he has al&s;o ven|tured to point out how it happened, viz. <Q>"From the inoculation of a great number of the patients with variolous matter (&s;ome on the third, others on the fifth day) after the vaccine had been applied."</Q> The opinion here given would have had greater influence
<PB N="12" REF="14">had the Doctor fir&s;t conde&s;cended to an&s;wer the rea&s;ons I gave twelve months ago, to &s;hew that it was unfounded: for I can hardly believe that mere conjecture on his part will be thought of &s;ufficient authority to di&s;annul the facts and arguments I had advanced.</P>
<P>Should all that Dr. Jenner contends for be granted, &s;till none of his ob&s;ervations can apply to tho&s;e patients who had pu&s;tules, though inoculated with matter taken imme|diately from the cow, and to whom no variolous matter was applied during the whole progre&s;s of the infection. In&s;tances of this kind the Dr. mu&s;t have read in my Reports, and mu&s;t at the &s;ame time have known them to be irreconcileable with his opinion. But I have di&s;covered from repeated experience, that if the matter of Cow-pox, and that of Small-pox be in&s;erted in the arm of a patient, even within an inch of each other, &s;o that on the
<PB N="13" REF="15">ninth day the &s;ame efflore&s;cence becomes com|mon to both the local infections, neverthele&s;s, upon inoculating with matter taken from the Cow-pock tumour, the genuine vaccine di&s;ea&s;e is invariably produced. And I am convinced from experience, that the matter thus taken would not be more liable to produce pu&s;tules, or a le&s;s favourable di&s;ea&s;e, than matter pro|cured directly from the cow.</P>
<P>I have already publi&s;hed &s;everal other expe|riments, to &s;hew that the Cow-pox does not <HI>hybridi&s;e</HI> with the Small-pox, even when ino|culation is performed with the matter of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es intimately mixed together in equal quantities. Dr. Jenner mu&s;t likewi&s;e know, that his friend Dr. Mar&s;hall has com|municated to him the following fact, which corroborates this opinion: <Q>"I vi&s;ited a patient with the confluent Small-pox, and charged a lancet with &s;ome of the matter. Two
<PB N="14" REF="16">days afterwards I was de&s;ired to inoculate a woman and four children with the Cow-pox, and I inadvertently took the vaccine matter on the &s;ame lancet which was before charged with that of Small-pox. In three days I di&s;covered the mi&s;take, and fully expected that my five patients would be infected with Small-pox; but I was agree|ably &s;urpri&s;ed to find the di&s;ea&s;e to be the genuine Cow-pox, which proceeded with|out deviating in any particular from my former ca&s;es."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Jenner, l. c. p. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have now, I pre&s;ume, &s;aid enough to convince the reader, that Dr. Jenner's &s;uppo|&s;ition is directly incompatible with e&s;tabli&s;hed facts; and I hope in future he will do the <HI>Ho&s;pital matter</HI> the ju&s;tice to &s;peak of it as it de&s;erves. It has been employed by many medical gentlemen, both in London and in
<PB N="15" REF="17">the country, and I do not know of one in|&s;tance in which it has not fully an&s;wered the utmo&s;t expectations of the inoculator. In making this remark I do not exclude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As an additional proof I may appeal to his &s;econd publica|tion on the variole vaccinae, where we are informed, that with this matter he inoculated two per&s;ons, viz. S. Jenner, three years and a half, and J. Hill, four years old. In the former "ca&s;e a few <HI>red &s;pots</HI> appeared, which quickly went off," but Hill had no eruption. From Hill the infection was transferred to 18 per&s;ons, on none of whom did it produce any pu&s;tules. The red &s;pots which appeared upon S. Jenner were then regard|ed by the Dr. as an evidence of the genuinene&s;s of the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e he had ob&s;erved &s;imilar appearances in the ca&s;ual Cow-pox. He was therefore led to &s;uppo&s;e, that the pu&s;tules which the vaccine matter produced in London, was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome peculiar influence of the town air. Since that time, however, Dr. J. has adopted an opinion, that "the Cow-pox virus a&s;&s;imilates the variolous," and facts, though <HI>&s;tubborn,</HI> mu&s;t as it often happens, <HI>bend</HI> a little to favour the hypothe&s;is. Thus, in the Dr's la&s;t publication, he &s;ays, "In a few weeks after the Cow-pox was introduced at the Small-pox Ho&s;pital, I was favoured with &s;ome virus from this &s;tock. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance it produced a few <HI>pu&s;tules,</HI> which did not maturate; but in the &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es none appeared." The red &s;pots are here changed into pu&s;tules, and appear at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> till the variolous poi&s;on is a&s;&s;imilated by that of the vaccine. Again, at page 22, he &s;ays, "Some of my corre&s;pondents have mentioned the appearance of Small pox-like eruptions at the <HI>commencement</HI> of their inoculations; but in the&s;e ca&s;es the matter was derived from the original &s;tock at the Small-pox Ho&s;pital."&mdash;But "it is the nature of an hypothe&s;is, when once a man has con|ceived it, that it a&s;&s;imilates every thing to it&s;elf as proper nouri&s;hment, and from the moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the &s;tronger by every thing you &s;ee, hear, or under&s;tand."&mdash;<HI>Tri&s;t. Shandy.</HI></NOTE> Dr.
<PB N="16" REF="18">Jenner, for in a letter to me the Dr. acknow|ledges that it had &s;ucceeded better than any of the vaccine matter which he had tried before. I beg al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that it had a very &s;trong claim to the Doctor's gratitude; for of the four hundred and twenty-three inoculations brought forward by him to &s;hew the advantages of the vaccine virus as u&s;ed by Dr. Mar&s;hall, two hundred and ninety-&s;ix were performed with the matter &s;ent from the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>La&s;t &s;ummer Mr. Abernethy procured at the Ho&s;pital &s;ome Cow-pock matter, which he tran&s;mitted to the Rev. Mr. Holt, Rector of
<PB N="17" REF="19">Finmere, near Buckingham: with this matter the Rector inoculated upwards of three hun|dred of his pari&s;hioners, in all of whom the di&s;ea&s;e proved mild and tractable. No vario|lous-like eruptions were produced, except on two per&s;ons, who had each one hundred pu&s;|tules.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Medical and Phy&s;ical Journal, vol. i. p. 401.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Finch, who was &s;upplied by Mr. Holt with &s;ome of this vaccine matter, inoculated 714 per&s;ons, on none of whom did any pu&s;tules, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Small-pox, appear. Now as Dr. Jenner does not believe that variolous-like pu&s;tules <HI>have ever been produced by the pure uncontaminated Cow|pock virus,</HI> he is involved in the dilemma of either relinqui&s;hing this opinion, or of admit|ting that the above were not ca&s;es of genuine Cow-pox, becau&s;e in two of Mr. Holt's ca&s;es pu&s;tules occurred.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<P>Although I differ in opinion from Dr. Jen|ner in not imputing the pu&s;tular eruptions, produced in the ca&s;es at the Ho&s;pital, to any adulteration of the vaccine matter, employed in the inoculations, yet I readily admit that they have been and &s;till continue to be the effect of &s;ome adventitious cau&s;e, independent of the Cow-pox.</P>
<P>This will clearly appear, from the following ob&s;ervations, which likewi&s;e tend to place the &s;ubject in a new light.</P>
<P>I had not long practi&s;ed the vaccine inocu|lation at the Ho&s;pital, before I was reque&s;ted to extend it into private families in the Metro|polis, where I &s;oon di&s;covered that the Cow-pox uniformly appeared in its milde&s;t form, and was never attended with eruptions. I al&s;o &s;upplied &s;everal medical gentlemen with the vaccine matter, which was u&s;ed by them with the like re&s;ult. Hence I began to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="19" REF="21">that there exi&s;ted &s;ome peculiar cau&s;e which rendered the patients under the vaccine inocu|lation in the Ho&s;pital more liable to pu&s;tules than others: and that this &s;u&s;picion was well founded I have &s;ince, from daily experience, been fully convinced.</P>
<P>At various times I procured the vaccine virus, as produced in different cows, and with it inoculated patients in the Ho&s;pital; but the effects of all the matter I tried were perfectly &s;imilar: and pu&s;tules proved to be not le&s;s frequently the con&s;equence of the&s;e trials than of tho&s;e made with the matter formerly em|ployed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t matter of the vaccine poi&s;on which I introduced into the Ho&s;pital, was obtained from Dr. Jenner, and originally taken from Clark's cow, before noticed: with this matter I inoculated at the Ho&s;pital on the &s;ame day three patients, on one of whom about 100
<PB N="20" REF="22">variolous-like pu&s;tules were produced. This in&s;tance, and numerous others of the like kind which I could adduce, decidedly prove, that where there can be no doubt entertained of the purity of the Cow-pock matter, with which the patients in the Ho&s;pital are inocu|lated, pu&s;tules will frequently be the con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>On the other hand I have to ob&s;erve, from daily experience during the la&s;t twelve months, that among the great numbers of children re|&s;iding in various parts of London, to whom I have transferred the Cow-pock infection, no in&s;tance of pu&s;tules that maturated has occur|red. Now as the&s;e different effects of the di&s;ea&s;e between the patients in, and tho&s;e out of the Ho&s;pital did not depend upon any difference or alteration of the matter with which the inoculations were performed, the only cau&s;e remaining to which the frequent
<PB N="21" REF="23">occurrence of pu&s;tules on the former can be rationally referred, is the variolated atmo&s;|phere of the Ho&s;pital, which tho&s;e patients were nece&s;&s;arily obliged to in&s;pire during the progre&s;s of the Cow-pox infection.</P>
<P>Did it not lead me too much into detail, I &s;hould &s;how from many circum&s;tances relating to the patients in the Inoculation Ho&s;pital, that other rea&s;ons might from thence be ad|duced to &s;upport the opinion here advanced.</P>
<P>Mr. Evans, Surgeon, at Ketley, in Shrop|&s;hire, is the only per&s;on, except my&s;elf, who has given an account of the variolous and vaccine inoculations carried on &s;eparately in different per&s;ons at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame hou&s;e, &s;o that &s;everal of his patients, while under the vaccine infection, were ex|po&s;ed to the variolous effluvia. The number of tho&s;e which he inoculated for the Cow-pox amounted to &s;ixty-eight; and it is worthy of
<PB N="22" REF="24">remark, that more than one-half of the&s;e patients had pu&s;tules.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many of Mr. Evan's patients were inoculated with matter &s;ent from Dr. Jenner.</NOTE> It is true that the eruptions very rarely maturated; but &s;till their frequent occurrence would &s;eem to &s;how they aro&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e as tho&s;e at the Ho&s;|pital. I &s;u&s;pect al&s;o, that in tho&s;e places where the Small-pox is epidemick, or very generally prevailing, the Cow-pox will be found to be equally liable to excite pu&s;tules as in the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>During the very general and fatal preva|lence of the Small-pox at a village eight miles di&s;tant from London, more than 100 per&s;ons were inoculated under my direction for the Cow-pox, of whom one in five had eruptions; and as the&s;e furni&s;h the only in&s;tances which I have experienced, out of the Ho&s;pital, of the Cow-pox producing the variolous-like pu&s;tules,
<PB N="23" REF="25">I am di&s;po&s;ed to attribute them to the adven|titious co-operation of the variolous atmo&s;|phere, to which the patients were expo&s;ed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have lately been favoured with &s;ome communications from the country, which tend to confirm this opinion.</NOTE> In what way the variolous mia&s;ms act in thus modifying the Cow-pox, or why they co-operate in &s;ome and not in all ca&s;es of vac|cine infection, I &s;hall not even venture a con|jecture: the cau&s;es probably will continue as inexplicable as tho&s;e con&s;titutional peculiarities which produce all the varieties of Small-pox.</P>
<P>A month had &s;carcely elap&s;ed after the publication of my Reports on the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e, before I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inform the public, that the Cow-pock ca&s;es at the Ho&s;pital had become con&s;iderably milder: ob&s;erving that out of the 310 inoculations, only 39 were attended with pu&s;tules, viz. out
<PB N="24" REF="26">of the fir&s;t 100, nineteen produced pu&s;tules; out of the &s;econd, 13; and out of the la&s;t 110, only &s;even excited pu&s;tules. Since the above &s;tatement, which was publi&s;hed in July, 1799, the new inoculation has by me, or under my immediate direction, been extended to about 2000 per&s;ons, with none of whom did the infection occa&s;ion a &s;evere di&s;order, or excite one alarming &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>In the Ho&s;pital, however, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;till continues to occa&s;ionally produce pu&s;tules, though not more than in the proportion of three or four ca&s;es out of 100. But in my private practice of inoculation for the Cow-pox, which has been very exten&s;ive, I have not met with one in&s;tance in which any pu&s;tules, re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Small-pox, occurred. Hence the advantages of this ino|culation over tho&s;e of that of the variolous, are (as far as relates to the comparative
<PB N="25" REF="27">&s;everity of the di&s;order which they re&s;pec|tively excite) mo&s;t &s;atisfactorily evinced.</P>
<P>In order to &s;how that tho&s;e who had under|gone the Cow-pox re&s;i&s;ted the infection of the Small-pox, I ob&s;erved in my <HI>Reports,</HI> that up|wards of 400 of the patients who had received the former di&s;ea&s;e, were afterwards inoculated for the latter, which in no in&s;tance was pro|duced; though more than 100 of the patients had the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e &s;o very &s;lightly, that it neither produced any perceptible indi&s;po&s;ition nor pu&s;tules. In addition to this, I can now &s;ay, that more than 1000 of tho&s;e who had undergone the new inoculation, have been put to the &s;ame te&s;t, and that the like re&s;ult has been experienced.</P>
<P>The above facts, added to a multiplicity of others of a &s;imilar import, publi&s;hed by &s;everal profe&s;&s;ional men, clearly demon&s;trate, that the Cow-pox inoculation promi&s;es mo&s;t impor|tant
<PB N="26" REF="28">benefits to &s;ociety; and under this con|viction I congratulate the public on the great progre&s;s it is making, by which the real value of the invention will &s;oon become generally acknowledged, and duly appreciated.</P>
<P>It was not to be expected that a di&s;ea&s;e originating in Brutes &s;hould be recommended as a &s;ub&s;titute for the Small-pox, and for this purpo&s;e be transferred to the human race, without exciting much obloquy and oppo&s;i|tion: indeed, &s;everal of the mo&s;t valuable di&s;coveries in medicine, have met with a &s;imilar reception; among the&s;e may be in|cluded inoculation of the Small-pox, again&s;t which the clamour became &s;o con&s;iderable, that it fell into di&s;u&s;e for &s;everal years. To regulate the di&s;putes which the introduction of that practice into this country occa&s;ioned, and to direct the controver&s;y to the true points at i&s;&s;ue, Dr. Jurin, then &s;ecretary to the Royal
<PB N="27" REF="29">Society, judiciou&s;ly &s;tated, that the fate of ino|culation depended upon the deci&s;ion of the two following que&s;tions:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> "Whether the di&s;temper, given by inoculation, be an effectual &s;ecurity to the patient again&s;t his having the Small-pox after|wards in the natural way?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> "Whether the hazard of the inoculation be con&s;iderably le&s;s than that of the natural Small-pox."</P>
<P>The application of the&s;e remarks to our inquiries into the merits of the vaccine, com|pared with tho&s;e of the variolous inoculation, is too obvious to require being pointed out. Now, if by di&s;temper in the fir&s;t query we under&s;tand that of the Cow-pox, and if in the &s;econd we add new immediately before ino|culation, and &s;ub&s;titute inoculated for natural, I would an&s;wer both que&s;tions in the affirma|tive, pre&s;uming that the facts already brought forward on the &s;ubject, clearly decide the
<PB N="28" REF="30">Cow-pock inoculation to be preferable to that of the Small-pox.</P>
<P>An opinion has been propagated, and with &s;everal per&s;ons has had con&s;iderable influence, that the power of re&s;i&s;ting the in&s;ection of the Small-pox, which the con&s;titution derives from the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e, will continue only for a few years: but this is mere conjecture, contradicted by facts of ca&s;ual ca&s;es of Cow-pox, and contrary to analogy.</P>
<P>We have abundant evidence to &s;hew, that the Cow-pox and Small-pox are clo&s;ely allied, and the effects of the former, by pre|venting the action of the latter, &s;eem to prove that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, are in re&s;pect to a very principal point, e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame: and as the change which the con&s;titution under|goes from the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e producing the effect above-mentioned mu&s;t be &s;imilar to that occa&s;ioned by the Small-pox, why &s;hould it not be equally permanent?</P>
<PB N="29" REF="31">
<P>In regard to the comparative mildne&s;s of the vaccine and variolous di&s;ea&s;es, as produced from inoculation, I have been enabled to give a very different report from that which I publi&s;hed la&s;t year. The rea&s;on why &s;everal of the Cow-pox ca&s;es then at the Ho&s;pital proved &s;evere, like tho&s;e of the ino|culated Small-pox, has already been &s;ufficiently explained, and will, I tru&s;t, have the effect of placing the Cow-pock inoculation in a more advantageous point of view than my former <HI>Reports</HI> pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved, that of the la&s;t 2000 ca&s;es of Cow-pox under my care, not a &s;ingle alarming &s;ymptom was excited; and I may now add, that during the la&s;t eight months I have not met with one in&s;tance of the vaccine di&s;ea&s;e, which has not been as favourable as the milde&s;t ca&s;es of variolous inoculation. I have no doubt, therefore, that
<PB N="30" REF="32">the inoculated Cow-pox is as much milder than the inoculated Small-pox, as the latter di&s;ea&s;e is milder than the ca&s;ual Small-pox: nay, it &s;eems to me from the very benign form in which the vaccine pock has of late invariably appeared, that it may be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e perfectly harmle&s;s in its effects.&mdash;Indeed, upon this con&s;ideration, &s;everal per|&s;ons have been per&s;uaded to have their chil|dren inoculated for the di&s;ea&s;e, although they were very doubtful of the reality of its anti|variolous power. For if it proved a &s;ecurity to the children again&s;t the infection of the Small-pox, the object would be attained by the &s;afe&s;t means: if it did not, no harm would ari&s;e from the experiment, &s;ince it was tried merely as a preliminary expedient to the inoculation for the Small-pox. The re&s;ult, however, has con&s;tantly furni&s;hed additional evidence in favour of the new inoculation,
<PB N="31" REF="33">and of cour&s;e has tended greatly to promote the adoption of it in London.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration, highly important to the community is, that as the Cow-pox, unle&s;s from the adventitious circum&s;tances before-mentioned, very rarely, if ever, appears with variolous-like pu&s;tules, it would &s;eem incapa|ble of propagating it&s;elf by effluvia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A child who had neither undergone the Small-pox nor Cow-pox &s;lept every night in the &s;ame bed with its father, mother, and brother, during the whole time the three latter were under inoculation for the Cow-pox; yet the child did not receive the di&s;ea&s;e till &s;ometime afterwards, in con&s;equence of inoculation.</NOTE> Hence by the &s;ub&s;titution of the vaccine for the variolous inoculation, the ca&s;ual &s;preading of the Small-pox from the inoculated, a circum|&s;tance which has greatly contributed to &s;well the bills of mortality for the metropolis, and of which the public has long ju&s;tly com|plained, is completely avoided. Nor is it unrea&s;onable to conclude, that if the new ino|culation
<PB N="32" REF="34">were to be univer&s;ally adopted, the variolous di&s;ea&s;e, in proce&s;s of time, may be wholly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>In my former publication on the Cow-pox I &s;ubjoined a tabular &s;tatement of the ca&s;es, in order to &s;hew at one view the re&s;ult of each; and it was my intention to continue this table, &s;o as to include all the inoculations that have &s;ince been under my direction: but as I now find &s;uch a &s;tatement could not be compri&s;ed in le&s;s than one hundred pages, and from what has already been ob&s;erved would be rendered in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s, I tru&s;t the reader will readily excu&s;e its omi&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall there|fore conclude the &s;ubject with &s;ome practical remarks.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have had much experience in inoculating with the matter of the vaccine pock, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that it is more apt to fail in communicating the infection than
<PB N="33" REF="35">variolous matter, e&s;pecially if it be &s;uffered to dry upon the lancet before it is u&s;ed. This does not &s;eem to depend upon the virus of the former being more volatile and more ea&s;ily carried off by evaporation than that of the latter, but from its becoming more hard and le&s;s di&s;&s;oluble upon ex&s;iccation. Care &s;hould therefore be taken to moi&s;ten it a con&s;ider|able time before it is u&s;ed. When fluid matter is employed, the lancet &s;hould be held nearly at a right angle with the &s;kin, in order that the infectious fluid may gravitate to the point of the in&s;trument, which in this direction &s;hould be made to &s;cratch the cuticle repeatedly, until it reach the true &s;kin, and become tinged with blood. This method has many advantages over the common punc|ture, and I have found it a more conve|nient and effectual mode of performing the inoculation than any other. It may be re|marked,
<PB N="34" REF="36">however, that there are per&s;ons who have never had the Small-pox, and are in|capable of receiving it by inoculation, or by any other means whatever. The proportion of the&s;e to tho&s;e liable to the di&s;ea&s;e have been differently &s;tated by authors; I have not found them to be more than about one in &s;ixty; but as &s;uch per&s;ons al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the in|fection of the Cow-pox, the inoculation of the latter mu&s;t therefore &s;ometimes fail, in|dependently of the mode in which it is per|formed, or of the matter employed.</P>
<P>When a con&s;iderable tumour, and an exten|&s;ive redne&s;s take place at the inoculated part within two or three days after the infectious matter has been applied, the failure of inocu|lation may be con&s;idered as certain, as where neither redne&s;s nor tumour is the con&s;e|quence. This rapid and premature advance|ment of the inflammation will always be
<PB N="35" REF="37">&s;ufficient to prevent the inoculator from mi&s;|taking &s;uch ca&s;es for tho&s;e of efficient inocu|lation. But there are other circum&s;tances under which I have found the inoculation to be equally ineffectual, and which as being more likely to deceive the inocula|tor, require his utmo&s;t circum&s;pection and di&s;crimination. I here allude to ca&s;es in which it happens, that though the local af|fection does not exhibit much more inflam|mation than is u&s;ual, yet neither ve&s;icle nor pu&s;tule &s;upervenes; and in which, about the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day, it rapidly advances into an irregular &s;uppuration, producing a fe&s;ter|ing, or cru&s;taceous &s;ore. Care, however, &s;hould be taken to di&s;tingui&s;h this ca&s;e from that in which the inoculated part a&s;&s;umes a pu&s;tular form, though it continue for one or two days only, when the &s;ame appearances follow as tho&s;e above de&s;cribed; for I have experienced the latter inoculation to be as
<PB N="36" REF="38">effectual as where the tumour has proceeded in the mo&s;t regular manner. The&s;e ob&s;er|vations, which I hope will be found u&s;eful to inoculators, are drawn from a con&s;iderable number of ca&s;es, &s;ome of which created in my mind much anxiety for the reputation of the Cow-pox. For until I had a&s;certained the di&s;criminating circum&s;tances here pointed out, I con&s;idered every new appearance of morbid action, which &s;eemed to take place at the inoculated part before the u&s;ual period at which the di&s;ea&s;e affects the con&s;titution, as &s;ugge&s;ting a doubt with re&s;pect to the efficacy of the inoculation. Hence I &s;ometimes judged it nece&s;&s;ary to inoculate the &s;ame patient a &s;econd, third, and even a fourth time. Some parents, however, were unwilling to &s;ubject their children to a repetition of the inocula|tion, and could not be prevailed upon to com|ply without much difficulty, even where their
<PB N="37" REF="39">refu&s;al might have been of fatal con&s;equence. I inoculated two children of the &s;ame fa|mily for the Cow-pox, the younger of whom was 18 months, and the elder four years old. On the fourth day the redne&s;s of the local affection in the elder extended to about one-third of an inch or more in diameter, and no ve&s;icle appeared. On the &s;ixth day the red|ne&s;s of the tumour was much increa&s;ed. On the following day the tumour &s;uppurated and produced a &s;uperficial ulcer for two or three days, when the induration and inflam|mation of the part wholly went off, and the fore healed. In the younger child the pro|gre&s;s of the infection was perfectly regular throughout all its &s;tages, and the di&s;ea&s;e was extremely mild. On the &s;ixth day I told the parents of the&s;e children that the elder had not received the Cow-pox, and that a &s;econd inoculation would be nece&s;&s;ary; at this they
<PB N="38" REF="40">appeared &s;urprized, and ob&s;erved, that the inoculation had produced more effect upon the elder than the younger child. However, on the ninth day they &s;uffered me to re|inoculate the elder in both arms, when each puncture produced the true vaccine pu&s;tule, and the infection proceeded in the mo&s;t re|gular manner.</P>
<P>Of mi&s;takes, ari&s;ing from ineffectual ca&s;es of the variolous inoculation, many in&s;tances have come under my knowledge, one of which was &s;o very remarkable that I &s;hall re|late it here. Not more than two months ago I was de&s;ired to attend a boy about five years old affected with the ca&s;ual Small-pox, of the mo&s;t confluent kind.</P>
<P>I was informed by the father that his &s;on who was then ill of the Small-pox had been inoculated for this di&s;ea&s;e three years before by Mr. &mdash;, who was a profe&s;&s;ional man of much experience; but as no pu&s;tules were
<PB N="39" REF="41">produced from the inoculation, he reque&s;ted Mr. &mdash; to try the effect of a &s;econd inocula|tion, and this reque&s;t he earne&s;tly repeated at different times. Mr. &mdash; however declined it, and a&s;&s;ured him that his child was perfectly &s;ecure again&s;t the Small-pox. The boy was therefore &s;uffered to play with his &s;i&s;ter while &s;he was under inoculation, and from her he received the di&s;ea&s;e, of which he died. Were the vaccine inoculation to be followed with a &s;imilar event, it is highly probable, that without adverting to the cau&s;e, it would be brought forward as a proof that the Cow-pox has not the power of preventing the Small-pox; and con&s;idering that of late the new inoculation has been very generally practi&s;ed, I am &s;urpri&s;ed that evidence again&s;t it of this de&s;cription has not yet been brought before the public.</P>
<P>The time at which the Cow-pox affects the
<PB N="40" REF="42">con&s;titution after the virus has been applied, appears to be differently &s;tated by inoculators: according to my ob&s;ervations it corre&s;ponds nearly to that of the variolous inoculation: however, it not unfrequently happens, that a ra&s;h takes place as &s;oon as the local action of the infectious matter becomes evident. The efflore&s;cence at the inoculated part which &s;el|dom &s;upervenes before the eighth, or latter than the eleventh day, is to be regarded as an indicacation that the whole &s;y&s;tem is affected; and if the patient has not felt any indi&s;po&s;ition on or before its approach, he may be a&s;&s;ured that there will not be any afterwards. When the efflore&s;cence does not commence till the eleventh day, it is almo&s;t always attended with more indi&s;po&s;ition than when it occurs on the eighth or ninth day. The efflore&s;|cence is more frequent in young infants than to children advanced to three or four years of
<PB N="41" REF="43">age, and the former have the efflore&s;cence &s;ooner, and the di&s;ea&s;e more favourably than the latter, in&s;omuch that by far the greater part of them have no perceptible illne&s;s, and require no medicines. On the other hand, in adults, the Cow-pox frequently produces head-ache, pain of the limbs, and other febrile &s;ymptoms, for two or three days, which are greatly relieved by a bri&s;k purgative.</P>
<P>After the local tumour has advanced &s;o far as to become a dry &s;cab, a few &s;cattered papu|lous, or pu&s;tular eruptions, &s;ometimes appear: the&s;e however are &s;eldom of long continuance, and the pu&s;tules rarely &s;uppurate, but when they do, the pus they contain is capable of producing the di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation. I have inoculated &s;ome children for the Cow-pox, who&s;e parents have been de&s;irous that two or three variolous-like pu&s;tules, &s;hould be pro|duced, which I have generally, though not
<PB N="42" REF="44">always, been able to accompli&s;h, by taking a little of the vaccine matter from the inocu|lated part upon a needle, and with it making a &s;light puncture in tho&s;e parts where it was wi&s;hed the pu&s;tules &s;hould appear. This &s;hould be done about the eighth or ninth day, or when the efflore&s;cence commences. If recent variolous matter be u&s;ed in&s;tead of the vaccine, the effect will be the &s;ame. With regard to the appearance of pu&s;tules from the vaccine inoculation, I &s;hall extract the following communication by Dr. Pear&s;on, which clearly &s;hews, that Dr. Jenner's opinion upon this &s;ub|ject is contradicted by facts:&mdash;<Q>"1. In a per&s;on inoculated by Dr. Jenner, in the country, who came to town, and was under the care of Mr. Cotton,"</Q> <Q>"the eruptions bore much re&s;emblance to the inoculated Small-pox, in number from twelve to twenty."</Q> See Mr. Cotton's letter to Dr. Pear&s;on.&mdash;<Q>"2. No
<PB N="43" REF="45">one has been more active and &s;ucce&s;sful than Mr. Ring; this gentleman, who&s;e experience I know has been very exten&s;ive, could not avoid eruptive ca&s;es, although he got matter with great pains, from different &s;ources."</Q> <Q>"I have,"</Q> &s;ays Mr. Ring, in his letter to Dr. Pear&s;on, <Q>"inoculated thirty patients, with matter given to me by Mr. Paytherus, and to him, by Jenner. One of the&s;e had about 150 pu&s;tules; the&s;e were not di&s;tingui&s;hable from variolous ones, by any diagno&s;tics with which I am acquainted. The matter was purulent; became perfectly opaque, and on ex&s;iccation, formed a &s;cab as large as that left by the Small-pox."</Q> Was the virus u&s;ed in the&s;e ca&s;es pure and uncontaminated?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gentleman lately obtained &s;ome vaccine matter from the Inoculation Ho&s;pital, which produced a full eruption of pu&s;tules: that this was owing to &s;ome mi&s;take, I have no doubt, but whatever was the cau&s;e, I think it right to mention it, as an exception to what has been before noticed.</NOTE></P>
