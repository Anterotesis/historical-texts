<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. STORY of the Hon. Mr. CLINTON.</HEAD>
<P>THE WORLD, my lovely Cou&s;in, the World is to Man as his Tem|per or Complexion. The Mind con&s;titutes its own Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;i|ty; Winter pre&s;ents no Cloud to a chearful
<PB N="4" REF="3">Spirit, neither can Summer find Sun&s;hine for the Spirit that is in a State of Dejecti|on. In my Youth every Object pre&s;ented me with Happine&s;s; but alas, the Time came when the Univer&s;e appeared as a Vault wherein Joy was entombed, and the Sun him&s;elf but as a Lamp that &s;erved to &s;hew the Gloom and the Horrors around me.</P>
<P>As my Father and Mother died before I was taken from Nur&s;e, I knew none of tho&s;e parental Tenderne&s;&s;es and Endearments that &s;erve to humanize the Soul and give it the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ocial Attachment; nei|ther were tho&s;e Sweetne&s;&s;es in any Degree &s;upplied to me by the Behaviour of an im|perious Brother or of a magi&s;terial Guar|dian. As I was naturally, however, of a benevolent Ca&s;t, I &s;ought for tho&s;e Affecti|ons and Amities among Strangers which I had not found in the Bo&s;oms or Faces of Kin.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s over the immaterial Parts of my Life at School and College, and ha&s;ten to the more important Period of my Appren|tice&s;hip.</P>
<P>Your Father bound me to Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> a very wealthy and eminent Merchant, who lived over again&s;t the <HI>Exchange.</HI> He had been &s;ome Years a Widower, and his
<PB N="5" REF="4">only Child, a Daughter, was then at the Boarding-&s;chool.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> with a plain Under&s;tand|ing, was a Man of exceeding Hone&s;ty and a &s;u&s;ceptible Heart. At fir&s;t Sight he con|ceived a partial Affection for me, whereof he gave me very frequent and very tender Proofs; and, as he &s;tood to me in the Place of a Patron and a Father, I felt for him all the Fondne&s;s and Attachment of a Child.</P>
<P>In the fourth Year of my Apprentice&s;hip he called me to his Clo&s;et, and, taking me kindly by the Hand, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, I love you, your Intere&s;t lies near my Heart, for though you are not the begotten of my Body you are the Child of my Affecti|ons&mdash;be quiet, <HI>Harry</HI>&mdash;let me &s;peak&mdash;I have to talk to you of Matters of Con&s;equence.&mdash;I went Ye&s;terday to your Uncle <HI>Goodall</HI> to know how Accounts &s;tood between ye&mdash;though he is but a cold Kin&s;man he is a very faithful Guardian&mdash;He has ju&s;t married a very lovely young Woman, and I would have you go and pay your Compliments to them on the Occa&s;ion.&mdash;Your Uncle has laid out your little Penny to good Advantage, and your 12000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is now nearly doubled&mdash;And now <HI>Harry,</HI> as your Father did not behave like
<PB N="6" REF="5">a Father toward you, in the Dividend which he made between you and your Bro|ther, I propo&s;e in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to &s;upply his Place, and I make you a Pre&s;ent of this Note of 12000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which added to your little Patrimony may enable you&mdash;O, Sir! I cried.&mdash;Be quiet, Child, I &s;ay again, till you find whether or no you &s;hall have Rea&s;on to thank me.&mdash;I am growing old, my <HI>Harry,</HI> and by a long Cour&s;e of Indu&s;|try have earned a kind of Title to &s;ome little Re&s;t; I would therefore gladly make a Compo&s;ition between your Application and my Repo&s;e. I &s;hall not be &s;o often in the Counting-Hou&s;e as u&s;ual. I propo&s;e to take you into immediate Partner&s;hip. But as I al&s;o propo&s;e that you &s;hall be at three fourths of the Trouble, it is but ju&s;t that I &s;hould offer you a proportionable Ad|vantage.&mdash;Now as my Capital, <HI>Harry,</HI> is more than five times as much as yours of 36000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I offer to your Acceptance a full Moiety of all the Profits in Recompence of your extraordinary Attention and Applica|tion.&mdash;Hear me out&mdash;I do not think that I &s;hall lo&s;e by this Bargain. The Affairs of <HI>Potiphar</HI> pro&s;pered under the Hands of Young <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> and I believe that you, al&s;o, are a Favourite of your God.</P>
<P>I could not &s;peak. The good Man per|ceived my Oppre&s;&s;ion, and catching me in his Arms, and pre&s;&s;ing me to his Bo&s;om, he
<PB N="7" REF="6">&s;hed a &s;ilent Tear of Satisfaction upon me, and withdrew without &s;aying another Word.</P>
<P>For &s;everal Days following Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> was employed in advi&s;ing his Corre&s;pon|dents that I was now become his Partner and equal in Trade, and I was wearied with Congratulations on my being one of the principal Merchants in <HI>London</HI> before I had attained my twentieth Year.</P>
<P>The Obligations and Advantages which this good Man thus delighted to heap upon me, incited me to double Application and Sagacity, and all the Eyes of <HI>Argus</HI> were opened within me for &s;uperintending and guarding the Intere&s;ts of my Patron.</P>
<P>I have often thought it &s;omewhat ro|mantic that I &s;hould win both my Wives by a matter of Adventure, &s;o that their Partiality in my Favour ought perhaps to be a&s;cribed to a Sentiment of Gratitude ra|ther than to any liking which they might take to my Per&s;on.</P>
<P>On a Day in Summer I rode to <HI>Barnet</HI> to &s;ettle Accounts with Mr. <HI>Fradgil,</HI> a Corre&s;pondent of my Ma&s;ter's, who was &s;aid to be indi&s;po&s;ed at his Country Seat. As I approached the Town, I ob&s;erved an elderly Gentlewoman walking lei&s;urely to|ward me, attended by an orderly Train of
<PB N="8" REF="7">young Maidens. I ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame Time, two Men in gli&s;tering Apparel who ha&s;tily followed, and, coming quickly up, put all the Females to a Stand, and cau&s;ed them to gather in a Group, as for mutual Defence. One of the Men, however, no way daunted by the Oppo&s;ition of &s;o nu|merous a Company, rudely caught one of the elder Mi&s;&s;es in his Arms, and repeat|edly ki&s;&s;ing her, thru&s;t his Hand into her Bo&s;om. Mean while the young Lady &s;hrieked and cried aloud for Help, when, riding &s;uddenly up, I &s;truck the Ruffian to the Ground, with the Heavy End of my Whip. His Companion hereupon drew his Sword and turned upon me, but, pu&s;h|ing my Hor&s;e at him, I ca&s;t him al&s;o to the Earth, then alighting, I broke their Swords, and, leaving my Gallants in a Plight not &s;uddenly to be dreaded, I led my Hor&s;e by the Bridle till I &s;aw my Fair Wards all &s;afe to their Dwelling.</P>
<P>Some Months after this Incident, Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> called me a&s;ide. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, my Daughter is now drawing to Woman's E&s;tate, and &s;hould learn &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial than Needle-work, and Dancing, and Harp&s;ichords, and frenchified Phra&s;es. I therefore propo&s;e to take her Home where, by the Help of our Cook and Hou&s;ekeeper, &s;he may be taught how to
<PB N="9" REF="8">make a <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Pudding, and to &s;uperin|tend a Family.</P>
<P>I regularly go to &s;ee her, once in every Month, accompanied by &s;ome Male or Fe|male Acquaintance, but never called you to be of the Party, as we could not &s;o con|veniently be both from Home.</P>
<P>My Child, though a plain Girl, is very dutiful and good-natured. Her Fortune, as you are &s;en&s;ible, will entitle her to the fir&s;t Lord of the Land; yet, I know not how it is, I would rather that my Girl &s;hould be happy than great. I do not wi&s;h to have her a fine titled Dame. I would rather, I &s;ay, &s;ee her married to &s;ome hone&s;t and tender-hearted Man, who&s;e Love might induce him to dome&s;ticate with her, and to live peaceably and plea|&s;ingly within his Family-circle, than to &s;ee her mated with a Prince of the Blood.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Harry,</HI> as this Affair, of all Af|fairs, &s;its neare&s;t at my Heart, it is greatly in your Power to oblige me beyond Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. On my Daughter's coming home, I conclude we &s;hall be be&s;et by a Number of Courtiers; &s;uch an <HI>Argo,</HI> when freighted with &s;uch a Fleece, will unque&s;tionably be held in Chace by many a Pirate. Where|fore, my Son, I would have you keep a &s;harp and inqui&s;itive Eye about you, and
<PB N="10" REF="9">to take good Note, of the Manners and Di&s;po&s;itions of &s;uch Suitors as my Daugh|ter &s;hall appear to regard. As al&s;o to en|quire minutely into their Circum&s;tances and Characters. Your Vigilance and Pe|netration may &s;ave us from Ruin. Should my Child be made Unhappy, your Friend mu&s;t be mo&s;t mi&s;erable. But I depend, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> that while I live you will prove a kind Brother to her; and that you will prove a Father to her in ca&s;e of my Mortality. Here the good Man, no longer able to re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion, put his Hand|kerchief to his Eyes and quitted the Chamber.</P>
<P>Within a few Days Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> &s;et out, accompanied by a Number of his City-Friends, in order to conduct his Daughter Home. On their Arrival, I was deeply engaged in the Counting-hou&s;e, and it was near the Time for Supper before I could attend. As I enter'd, Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> pre&s;ent|ed me to his Daughter, &s;aying, this, my Dear, is Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> my Partner, my Friend, my Son, and your Brother. Here|upon Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> coloured, and drawing back as I approached to &s;alute her, if I am not mi&s;taken, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, he is &s;ome|thing more to us than all you have menti|oned, it would ill become me to forget that he is the Deliverer of your Daugh|ter.&mdash;Your Deliverer, my dear <HI>Matty!</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">how, where, when?&mdash;Why pray, Papa, did Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> never tell you of his Ad|venture at <HI>Barnet?</HI>&mdash;No indeed, my Dear.&mdash;It is not every one who would be &s;ilent, Papa, where &s;o much was to be &s;aid to their own Honour. I remember that your Knights in Romance, when too mode&s;t to boa&s;t of their own Achievements, u&s;ed to permit &s;ome Friend or Squire to deliver down to Po&s;terity the Hi&s;tory of their Ad|ventures, and I take the Liberty to be Squire to Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> on the like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> began to give a Nar|rative of the Matter already recited, but in Terms of high Phra&s;e and aggravated En|comium. While all aba&s;hed and confu&s;ed, I withdrew, &s;aying, that I did not remem|ber of any Knights who &s;taid to hear their own Story.</P>
<P>In Truth I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> mention the Adventure of <HI>Barnet,</HI> for I did not recollect that I had ever &s;een her, and had taken much more Note of two or three other Mi&s;&s;es than I had of her.</P>
<P>Being re&s;ummoned to Supper, Mr. <HI>Gol|ding</HI> met me as I entered and cla&s;ping me in his Arms, O my <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, how wonderfully gracious has God been to me in &s;ending my be&s;t Friend to the Re&s;cue of
<PB N="12" REF="11">my only Child, in &s;ending at &s;o critical and very fearful a Conjuncture, perhaps the only Per&s;on who had either Gallantry or Humanity enough to pre&s;erve her. Indeed Sir, I replied, you owe me nothing; I did not even know that the Lady was your Daughter, and I could not pride my&s;elf, in any Degree, on an Action which I thought incumbent on every Man to per|form.</P>
<P>During Supper Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> was very chearful and agreeable. Her Face indeed could not be numbered among the Beau|ties, but her Per&s;on was Grace and Ma|je&s;ty though in Miniature, her Conver&s;a|tion was plea&s;ing, and when &s;he &s;ung or touched her In&s;truments, for &s;he was Mi&s;|tre&s;s of &s;everal, her Mien and Motions were Mu&s;ic, each Note &s;eemed a Senti|ment, and we felt her Fingers playing on the Chordage of our Heart.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t three Months after Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI>'s Arrival, all was crowding and Gaiety, A&s;&s;embly and Fe&s;tival at our Hou&s;e. She was as a Magnet that drew and grouped all the Peerage and Gentry of <HI>England</HI> together. But as Bu&s;ine&s;s hap|pened to be very throng at that Sea&s;on, I was not at Liberty to partake of their Amu&s;ements, and I re&s;igned to Mr. <HI>Gold|ing</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ion which he had given
<PB N="13" REF="12">me re&s;pecting the Parties who declared them&s;elves Suitors.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e Suitors, in a daily and nume|rous Succe&s;&s;ion, applied to Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> for his Con&s;ent, his general An&s;wer was that his Good-liking was in&s;eparable from that of his only Child, that he would, if they plea&s;ed, con&s;ult her on the Occa&s;ion, and faithfully report to them her Appro|bation or Di&s;&s;ent. In the like conclu&s;ive Manner, when Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> repeatedly que&s;tioned his Daughter, &s;he would take his Hand between her's and ki&s;&s;ing it, &s;ay, O no, my dear Papa, this is not the Man.</P>
<P>One Day, as I &s;at alone in the Counting-Room, Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> entered and pre&s;ent|ed me with an Order from her Father for &pound;250. And pray Madam, &s;aid I, why this Ceremony, this Matter of Form? &s;ure Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> may, at any Time, com|mand twenty Times this Sum without any Order &s;ave her own Intimation.&mdash;Indeed! are you &s;erious Mr. <HI>Clinton?</HI> I am very proud I a&s;&s;ure you to have &s;o much Credit with you&mdash;But, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> how comes it to pa&s;s that we have &s;o little of your Company?&mdash;Your Father's Bu&s;ine&s;s, Ma|dam, deprives me of the Plea&s;ure I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have in attending you.&mdash;Again, Sir, I am quite proud that it is your At|tention to my Father, alone, which pre|vents
<PB N="14" REF="13">your having any Attention for his Daughter&mdash;&s;o &s;aying, &s;he vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Immediately I was &s;truck with a Glimp&s;e of &s;ome uncommon Meaning in the Words and Behaviour of Mi&s;s <HI>Golding,</HI> but as I never had looked toward the Way of her Affections, I pa&s;&s;ed it lightly over as &s;ome Matter of Whim or Caprice in the Sex.</P>
<P>Among the brilliant Concour&s;e of Suitors that frequented our Hou&s;e there was one Mr. <HI>Spelling,</HI> a young Gentleman highly accompli&s;hed in his Per&s;on and Manners, and of a mo&s;t amiable Countenance and Di&s;po&s;ition. His Father, like Mi&s;s <HI>Gold|ing</HI>'s, had been a Merchant, and like him too had ama&s;&s;ed an exce&s;&s;ive Fortune. As he was mode&s;t, as I may &s;ay, to a Degree of Shamefacedne&s;s, he did not declare him|&s;elf a Lover, till nearly the whole Multi|tude of Competitors had been di&s;carded. Then, with a blu&s;hing Diffidence, he avowed his Pa&s;&s;ion to Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> and earne&s;tly be&s;ought his Con&s;ent and Inter|ce&s;&s;ion in his Favour. You have not only my Con&s;ent, replied the good old Man, you have al&s;o my be&s;t Wi&s;hes, and &s;hall have my be&s;t Endeavours for your Succe&s;s: However I mu&s;t warn you at the &s;ame Time, Mr. <HI>Spelling,</HI> that I will not do any Violence to the Inclinations of my Child,
<PB N="15" REF="14">although there are not two in the World whom I would prefer to you.</P>
<P>I was writing in my Clo&s;et when Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> came in, with an anxious Impor|tance in his Countenance, and told me what pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. <HI>Spelling,</HI> and a&s;ked if I did not approve the Match. I do not know Sir, &s;aid I, that Man in <HI>England</HI> who is &s;o de&s;erving of your Daughter as Mr. <HI>Spelling.</HI> Then, my dear <HI>Harry,</HI> I have a Commi&s;&s;ion to give you, <HI>Matilda</HI> has a great Re&s;pect for your Judgment, I be&s;eech you to make U&s;e of your Influence with her, and to exert all your Oratory in Behalf of this young Man.&mdash;But, Sir, will not Mi&s;s <HI>Matilda</HI> look on this as a Matter of high Pre&s;umption in one who has no Manner of Right to advi&s;e.&mdash;No Matter, you may tell her that you did it by my De|&s;ire and that we are both of a Mind with Regard to this Bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Well Sir, &s;aid I, &s;ince you are bent upon it, I will obey you, but it is the fir&s;t Time that ever I obeyed you with Reluctance.</P>
<P>Soon after Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> left me his Daugh|ter entered, with a Countenance vi&s;ibly inquiet and confu&s;ed. My Papa, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, informs me that you have a Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence to impart to me.&mdash;I hope,
<PB N="16" REF="15">Madam, pray be &s;eated a Moment.&mdash;In|deed, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Golding,</HI> this Office was not of my chu&s;ing, and I hope, I &s;ay, you will be &s;o good as to pardon my Pre|&s;umption, in Con&s;ideration of my acting by your Father's Command.&mdash;You alarm me, Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> pray proceed.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Spelling,</HI> Madam, at length has had the A&s;&s;urance to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion for you. Your Father highly approves of Mr. <HI>Spelling</HI> for a Son-in-law; and indeed, Mi&s;s, might I dare to &s;peak my Judgment, I know not where you could chu&s;e to better Advantage.&mdash;If that is the Ca&s;e, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> I wi&s;h that I al&s;o could be of the &s;ame Opinion&mdash;And are you not, Madam? what Objection can you form, what Exception can you have to my Friend <HI>Spelling?</HI>&mdash;A very &s;imple one, Sir, and no better than this, that he is not the Man who can make me happy.&mdash;I am &s;orry for it, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Golding,</HI> I am truly &s;orry for it; were I to pick from Mankind, were I to chu&s;e throughout the World, if any One can de&s;erve you, it is &s;urely this &s;ame <HI>Spelling</HI>&mdash;And yet, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> I remember to have &s;een the Man who, in every Grace and Merit, is infinitely preferable to your Favourite <HI>Spelling.</HI>&mdash;Where, when, my dear Mi&s;s?&mdash;When I am brought to the Torture, I may po&s;&s;ibly be under the nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Par|don, pardon, &s;weet Madam! I meant no Offence; and yet I wi&s;h to Heaven I knew
<PB N="17" REF="16">&mdash; But that you never &s;hall know, Mr. <HI>Harry.</HI> &mdash; Pray then, Madam, if I may ad|venture on one Que&s;tion more, has the Party &s;o highly favoured any Knowledge of his own Happine&s;s? &mdash; I hope not, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> but of what Advantage could his Knowledge prove to me I be&s;eech you? can you &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a Per&s;on as I have de&s;cribed could deign to look with Favour on &s;uch a one as I am? &mdash; I do not believe, Madam, that the Man is in <HI>England</HI> who would not think him&s;elf highly honour'd, highly ble&s;s'd by your Hand. But then are you a&s;&s;ured, Mi&s;s, that this Man is worthy of it?&mdash;Ah, there lies my Misfortune! he is too worthy, too noble, too accom|pli&s;h'd, too lovely, too much every thing for my Wi&s;hes to leave any thing to my Hopes. And now, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> that I have entru&s;ted you with my Secret, I hope you will not betray my Confidence and reveal it to my Papa. I rather tru&s;t and reque&s;t that you will u&s;e &s;ome other Colour for reconciling him to my Refu&s;al of Mr. <HI>Spelling.</HI> And to make you &s;ome Amends for the Mortification I have given you, by rejecting your Advocation in Behalf of your Friend, I here engage never to marry with|out your Approbation, though I do not pro|mi&s;e, Sir, that you &s;hall dictate to my Choice. There is one Thing further, Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> in which you may oblige me, it is to prevail on my Father to di&s;mi&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="17">the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies and Revels that pe&s;ter our Hou&s;e; indeed, they never were to my Ta&s;te, though, by their Novelty, at fir&s;t they might have helped to amu&s;e a little Matter of Melancholy that hung upon my Mind, but now they are grown quite in|&s;ufferable to me. &mdash; Here her Eye began to fill, and, heaving a gentle Sigh, &s;he curt|&s;ied and withdrew.</P>
<P>Immediately my Heart was &s;oftened and affected, I &s;aw the Child of my Friend and Patron, the one in whom his Hopes and Fortunes and very Life were wrapt up, I &s;aw that &s;he was unhappy, that &s;he was ve|ry unhappy, at a Time that &s;he had forbid|den me to attempt her Relief, though I would gladly have parted with Half my Fortune to have been enabled to give the Object of her Wi&s;hes to her Arms.</P>
<P>In the mean while, my deare&s;t Madam, it was the farthe&s;t of all Things from en|tring into my Imagination, that I was the very Per&s;on who &s;at &s;o near her Heart. I daily &s;aw the lovelie&s;t Youths and titled Chiefs of the Land attendant on her Words and Smiles, and humbly &s;uing for her Fa|vour. I &s;aw al&s;o that her immen&s;e For|tune and rare Attractions ju&s;tly entitled her to their Homage, and I was neither vain enough nor ba&s;e enough to attempt a Competition.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
As in my&s;elf I was wholly devoid of Pa&s;|&s;ion, I had neither Eyes nor Apprehen&s;ion for the Di&s;cernment of hers. Though I had often &s;een, I &s;eldom had any Kind of Conver&s;e with her, and where the Head is engaged and in a Manner ab&s;orbed by Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, there is neither Lei&s;ure nor Room for Love to enter the Heart. On the other Hand, a Per&s;on affected can in&s;tantly pene|trate the Bo&s;om of the Party beloved, and there di&s;cern a vacant and in&s;en&s;ible Heart as legibly as a Prie&s;t of <HI>I&s;is</HI> could decypher Hieroglyphics.</P>
<P>One Day, as I happened to pa&s;s near her Antichamber, I heard the warble, as I thought, of di&s;tant and aetherial Mu&s;ic. I approached tow'rd the Sound, the Door was on the jar, and, gently opening it, I enter'd and &s;tood behind her unperceived. She &s;at and &s;ang to her Lute. The Words were <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, but &s;weetly &s;et by her|&s;elf. They expre&s;s'd that Pa&s;&s;age in his Play of Twelfth Night, where it is &s;aid of <HI>Viola, She never told her Love, but let Concealment, like a Worm i'th' Bud, feed on her dama&s;k Cheek, &amp;c.</HI> Ah, how affectingly did her In&s;trument an&s;wer to her Voice, while &s;he gently tuned her Sighs to the &s;oft and melancholy Cadences. My Brea&s;t was &s;o &s;welled by a Mixture of Angui&s;h and Compa&s;&s;ion that I could no longer
<PB N="20" REF="19">wholly &s;uppre&s;s a ri&s;ing Groan. Hereat &s;he &s;tarted and turned, and ri&s;ing &s;uddenly, her Eyes &s;hot Fire, and her Face glowed with Indignation and Re&s;entment. But, ob&s;erv|ing the Tears that &s;till trickled down my Cheeks, her Countenance was as &s;uddenly changed into Kindne&s;s, and &s;he ca&s;t upon me a Look of inexpre&s;&s;ible Complacence.</P>
<P>Ah, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I &s;ee, I &s;ee that you have a gentle and a kindred Kind of Heart, and that, if ever you happen to love, you will love with great Tenderne&s;s. &mdash; Have you ever loved, Mr. <HI>Harry?</HI> &mdash; Indeed, Ma|dam, I cannot &s;ay, my Commerce has been very little among the Ladies. If I met Love on my Way, or even found it in my Heart, perhaps I &s;hould not rightly know what to make of it. But, my <HI>Matilda,</HI> my charming Si&s;ter, (your Father has ho|noured me with the Privilege of calling you by that dear that tender Name) why will you not entru&s;t your be&s;t your true&s;t Friend with the Secret of your Di&s;quiet? whoever the Object of your E&s;teem may be, I here &s;olemnly engage, at the Ri&s;que of my Life and the Lo&s;s of my Fortune, to bring him voluntarily to pay his Vows at your Feet. O, my Si&s;ter, I would to Heaven that he had now been pre&s;ent, as I have been pre|&s;ent, to have his Soul melted and minted as mine has been; his Heart mu&s;t have been harder than the Stones of <HI>Thebes,</HI> if you
<PB N="21" REF="20">did not attract it and move it, at plea&s;ure, by the Touch of tho&s;e Fingers and the Be|witchment of tho&s;e Accents. &mdash; Ah, you Flatterer, &s;he cried, with a Voice tuned to Harmony, and a Face form'd of Smiles, you almo&s;t tempt me to tell you what, for the World, I would not wi&s;h that any one in the World &s;hould know. But, I mu&s;t &s;natch my&s;elf from the Danger. &mdash; So &s;aying, and ca&s;ting at me a vani&s;hing Glance, &s;he was out of &s;ight in a twinkling.</P>
<P>As our Suitors had now been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and our A&s;&s;emblies di&s;continued, Mi&s;s <HI>Gold|ing</HI> &s;eem'd quite pleas'd with our Family-abridgment; it gave us frequent Occa&s;ions of being together; I endeavoured, by a Variety of tender Offices and little Amu&s;e|ments, to di&s;pell or divert the Melancholy under which I thought &s;he laboured; I was greatly &s;urprized at my own Succe&s;s on this Occa&s;ion; her Chearfulne&s;s return'd; &s;he di&s;covered new and &s;triking Graces in her Manners and Conver&s;ation, and in a little Time did not appear to want any Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>One Day, being on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> I was acco&s;ted by a <HI>Jew,</HI> who told me that he wanted a Sum of Money and would either &s;ell or pawn to me a Jewel of great Price. It was a Solitaire compo&s;ed of Oriental Pearls, with a Diamond of the fir&s;t Wa|ter
<PB N="22" REF="21">and Magnitude in the Centre: After &s;ome chaffering, we agreed for three thou|&s;and Pieces, and I put it into my Pocket|book. As my Bu&s;ine&s;s detained me on the <HI>Exchange</HI> till it was late, I dined with two or three Acquaintance at the Chop-Hou&s;e and did not return till the Evening was advanced.</P>
<P>On my entering, I was told that Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> was abroad, and that Mi&s;s <HI>Matilda</HI> had ju&s;t ordered Coffee for &s;ome Ladies in her Dre&s;&s;ing-room. Immediatly I ran up and opened the Door without Ceremo|ny, but was in&s;tantly &s;truck with the Look which &s;he turned tow'rd me, a Look that at once intimated Dejection and Di&s;gu&s;t. During Coffee, I endeavoured to behave with my u&s;ual Unconcern, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;haring in that Con|&s;traint under which Mi&s;s <HI>Matilda</HI> mo&s;t evi|dently laboured; in &s;hort, a gloomy Stiff|ne&s;s &s;pread through the whole Conver&s;ati|on, and I believe no two Per&s;ons in Com|pany were rightly &s;atisfied with each other.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Cups were removed, the fair Vi&s;itants got up; and, as Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;tay, in a Manner that ra|ther denoted her De&s;ire of their Ab&s;ence; they feigned a further Engagement, and very formally took their Leaves.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
When &s;he had &s;een them to the Door, and that I had handed them into their Carriages, &s;he turned without &s;peaking to me and withdrew toward her own Apart|ment. I followed, and, as &s;he was about to enter, my <HI>Matilda,</HI> my Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, with a Voice of cordial Tenderne&s;s, do your <HI>Harry</HI> the Favour to accept this Trifle, as an In&s;tance of my Regard for the Daugh|ter of my Friend, for the deare&s;t Object, upon Earth, of my E&s;teem and Affection. So &s;aying I pre&s;ented her with my recent Purchace; &s;he did not, however, even deign to look at it; but, &s;urveying me from Head to Foot with an Eye of &s;trange Pa&s;&s;ions, &s;he took it and da&s;hed it again&s;t the Floor, and, ru&s;hing into her Chamber, &s;he &s;hut to the Door upon me, without &s;peaking a Word.</P>
<P>I &s;tood in an inconceivable A&s;toni&s;h|ment and Concern. In vain I &s;earched and re&s;earched my Memory for the Recollecti|on of &s;ome In&s;tance wherein I might have offended her; but, not pre&s;uming to ob|trude upon her in order to que&s;tion or ex|po&s;tulate with her, I retreated to my Apart|ment under the deepe&s;t Dejection of Spirits.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> did not return till it was late in the Evening. He immediatly &s;ent for me. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, what is the Mat|ter,
<PB N="24" REF="23">has any Thing happened ami&s;s? I ne|ver &s;aw you look &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed. Indeed, Sir, I am not as well as I could wi&s;h. Ble&s;s me, we had better &s;end for a Doctor. No, Sir, I am in Hopes it will &s;oon be over.&mdash;Where is <HI>Matilda?</HI>&mdash;In her Chamber, Sir, I believe.&mdash;He then called Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and bid her tell <HI>Matilda</HI> that he de&s;ired to &s;peak with her, but &s;he an&s;wered that her Mi&s;|tre&s;s was gone to Bed indi&s;po&s;ed, and re|que&s;ted that &s;he might not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Supper being &s;erved up, we &s;at down in Silence, and as neither of us offered to ta&s;te a Bit, I ro&s;e, wi&s;hed Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> a good Night, and retired to my Chamber.</P>
<P>After a &s;leeple&s;s Night, my Servant en|tered in a vi&s;ible Alarm, and told me that Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> was extremely ill, and that almo&s;t all the Phy&s;icians in <HI>London</HI> had been &s;ent for.</P>
<P>Very unhappy were many &s;ucceeding Days. I &s;aw my Friend, my Father, the Man I loved above the World, I &s;aw him in a Depth of Di&s;tre&s;s that bordered on Di&s;|traction, and I found my Heart wrung with inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Though I was con&s;tant in my Enquiries after Mi&s;s <HI>Golding,</HI> yet I purpo&s;ely avoided appearing in her Pre&s;ence, le&s;t the Sight of
<PB N="25" REF="24">one &s;o obnoxious &s;hould add to her Di&s;tem|per. At length the good old Man came to me, wringing his Hands, will you not go <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, will you not go and &s;ee <HI>Matilda</HI> before &s;he dies? The Doctors tell me they have tried all the Powers of Me|dicine, but that they do not yet know what to make of her Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>My dear Sir, &s;aid I, it is then no longer time to conceal from you what I know or conjecture concerning this Matter. Mi&s;s <HI>Matilda,</HI> her&s;elf, entru&s;ted me with the Secret, but under the &s;tricte&s;t Injunctions of Silence; the Extremity of her Ca&s;e, how|ever, ought to di&s;pen&s;e with all &s;uch En|gagements. Your Daughter loves, Sir, &s;he loves with Pa&s;&s;ion, but who the Object of her Affections is I cannot imagine. Let it be your Part to di&s;cover what &s;he &s;o in|du&s;triou&s;ly hides from the World, &s;he will refu&s;e nothing to the Authority or rather to the Tenderne&s;s of &s;uch a Parent.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> left me, but returned in about an Hour. His whole Frame &s;eem|ed to labour with &s;omething extraordinary. You were right, <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, you were right in your Conjectures; my Prayers and my Tears have at length prevailed, with difficulty I have wrung the Secret from her. O, my Son! it is greatly in your Power to befriend us. Would you not do
<PB N="26" REF="25">&s;omething for the Relief of a Family who doat upon you as we do? would you not do &s;omething for your old Friend who loves you as fondly as ever Father loved a Child? Something for you, Sir, &s;aid I, yes, every thing, all things that are po&s;&s;ible to be done. But, pray Sir, do I know the Party? You do, <HI>Harry,</HI> you do, he cried, for, as the Prophet &s;aid unto <HI>David,</HI> thou art the Man.</P>
<P>Me, Sir! I exclaimed, impo&s;&s;ible! &s;he cannot bear my Sight, &s;he hates me, &s;he dete&s;ts the Ground I go upon. Not &s;o, &s;aid he, not &s;o, &s;he loves the very Du&s;t upon which you tread. Something &s;urely is due in Mitigation of the Calamities which you have occa&s;ioned. We lie at your Mercy, Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> my precious Daughter and my&s;elf, it is your's to bid us live or die at your Plea&s;ure, to cru&s;h us into nothing, or to re&s;tore us to Exi&s;tence, to Health, to Enjoyment. Will it hurt you, my Son, to do us the&s;e great Bene|fits? is it a Matter grievous to you to give Happine&s;s to tho&s;e, who&s;e Exce&s;s of Love for you is their only Misfortune? A princely Fortune attends you. We and all we have are yours, Mr. <HI>Clinton.</HI> We are de&s;irous of depending on your Bounty alone. Let the Extremene&s;s of my Daugh|ter's Affection for you excite &s;omething more kindly than Hatred in your Brea&s;t.
<PB N="27" REF="26">If not for her Sake, yet for mine, my be|loved <HI>Harry,</HI> let me be&s;eech you to con|&s;train your&s;elf before her, to affect &s;ome little Tenderne&s;s, &s;ome Appearance of Re|gard, that may revive her, awhile at lea&s;t, from the deplorable State under which &s;he langui&s;hes.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke I was agitated by un|utterable Emotions, and he might have proceeded much further, before I &s;hould have had the Power to reply. At length I ca&s;t my&s;elf on my Knee, and catching his Hand to my Bo&s;om, Ah, my Friend, my Father, my dear Father, I cried, am I then no better than a Barbarian in your Sight? To me would you impute &s;uch Sentiments of Cruelty and Ingratitude? Take my Hand, Sir, take my Heart, di&s;|po&s;e of them as you plea&s;e. All that I have, all that I am is yours and your Daughter's, without any kind of Re&s;erve for any other Per&s;on breathing.</P>
<P>The good Man caught me in his Arms, and pre&s;&s;ed me to his Brea&s;t in a long and &s;peechle&s;s Ec&s;ta&s;y; then, taking me by the Hand, he led me in Silence to his Daugh|ter's Apartment.</P>
<P>As we entered &s;he turned her Eyes toward the Door, and her pale and languid Coun|tenance was &s;traight &s;uffu&s;ed with a &s;hort
<PB N="28" REF="27">lived Red. I was &s;o affected by the Con|dition in which I beheld her, that I &s;carcely was able to reach her Bed&s;ide, where kneeling down I gently took one of her Hands, and pre&s;&s;ing it between mine, I bathed it in a &s;ilent Shower of Tears.</P>
<P>Ah, my Papa, &s;he faintly cried, I fear you have betray'd me, Mr. <HI>Harry</HI> is cer|tainly informed of my Weakne&s;s. I am informed, &s;aid I, my lovely, my all-beloved Si&s;ter, I am informed that I am permitted to hope for a Happine&s;s that is infinitely above my Merit, but it &s;hall be the de|lightful Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>My Dear, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> I perceive you are &s;omething flu&s;ter'd, your Con&s;titu|tion is too weak for &s;uch Emotions as the&s;e. For the pre&s;ent your Brother <HI>Harry</HI> mu&s;t leave you. To-morrow, I tru&s;t, you will be better able to &s;upport our Company.</P>
<P>Hereupon I took her Hand, and, im|pre&s;&s;ing upon it a tender and warm Ki&s;s, I ju&s;t ventured to look up, and &s;aw her fine Eyes &s;uffu&s;ed with a glittering Tear, and her Countenance bent upon me with a Look of inde&s;cribable Sweetne&s;s and Delight; but Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> to prevent the Effects of too tender a Scene, in&s;tantly took me by the Arm and led me away.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">
As he perceived that my Spirits had been much di&s;turbed, he ordered a Bottle to his own Chamber, and told me that he reque&s;t|ed &s;ome further Conver&s;e with me. As &s;oon as we had taken our Seats, he looked earne&s;tly upon me, then &s;eized me by the Hand, and looked at me again. But &s;ud|denly getting up, he turned and &s;tepped to the Window, and, breaking into Tears, he there wept and &s;obbed for good Part of an Hour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was &s;omewhat compo&s;ed, he re&s;umed his Seat. Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> &s;ays he, are you really &s;incere in your Profe&s;&s;ions with Re&s;pect to my Daughter? Shall I be rid of my Doubts at once? May I venture to a&s;k you a Que&s;tion, on which my own Life as well as that of my Child may de|pend? Should it plea&s;e the Almighty to rai&s;e her from her pre&s;ent Bed of Sickne&s;s, is it actually your Intention to make her your Wife?</P>
<P>Here, I demanded with &s;ome Warmth, is that a Que&s;tion, Sir, at this time? What Rea&s;on have I given you to &s;u&s;pect my Honour or my Truth?&mdash;I do not &s;u&s;pect you, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I do not &s;u&s;pect you; I know you would not deceive me, but you may have deceived your&s;elf. Your Nature is tender and full of Pity; and, in the de|plorable
<PB N="30" REF="29">E&s;tate in which my Girl lies, your great Compa&s;&s;ion may have ea&s;ily been mi&s;taken by you for Love. Your Friend&s;hip for me al&s;o may have helped to impo&s;e upon you, and you may have con&s;trued your Regard and Attachment to the Father into a Sentiment of Tender|ne&s;s and Affection for the Child. But O, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;hould any other Woman be pre|ferable in your Eyes; or &s;hould it not be in my Girl's Power to win and wear your Affections, I &s;hall then have been in&s;tru|mental in making you wretched, and my Heart may as well be broken the one way as the other.&mdash;No, my Father, no. I have no foreign <HI>Dalilahs,</HI> no &s;ecret Amours, no Plea&s;ures that &s;hun the Light. My Heart is a virgin Heart, and my <HI>Matilda</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it without a Rival.</P>
<P>From the Time that I was &s;en&s;ible of my Father's Partiality, a little Matter of Ambition, whether laudable or otherwi&s;e, incited me to attempt a Di&s;tinction that would rai&s;e me toward a Level with an only Brother who looked down with Ne|glect and Contempt upon me. Thence I became indefatigable in my Studies at School and College, as al&s;o in my Appli|cation under you, Sir, during the fir&s;t Years of my Apprentice&s;hip, and this left me no Manner of Lei&s;ure for female At|tachments. Indeed I dreaded the Appear|ance
<PB N="31" REF="30">of any Advances from the Sex, and turned from them as I would from &s;o ma|ny Gins or Pit-falls purpo&s;ely dug for my De&s;truction. My Conver&s;ation, Sir, has been very little among the Fair, and, ex|cepting my natural Propen&s;ity to the Sex, I never, till very lately, conceived a Liking for any Woman. In Truth, my dear Fa|ther, that Lady is not alive whom my Judgment or Inclinations would prefer to your <HI>Matilda.</HI> You need not fear my be|ing wretched, I think my&s;elf mo&s;t happy in her Affections.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid he, I pronounce her the happie&s;t of Women. And now, my <HI>Har|ry,</HI> I will tell you a Secret. From the fir&s;t time that I beheld you, I wi&s;hed you for my Daughter, I wi&s;h'd that &s;he might have Charms to attract and fix your Heart; but, as I feared, and was per&s;ua|ded that this was not the Ca&s;e, I forbore to indulge my&s;elf in &s;uch flattering Expec|tations. You know I never took you with me to &s;ee her at the Boarding-School, the true Rea&s;on was that I dreaded expo&s;ing her young and inexperienced Heart to &s;uch a Temptation, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould conceive and langui&s;h under a hopele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On her Return to Town, my Apprehen|&s;ions, on your Score, were much abated, as I imagined that the great Number of
<PB N="32" REF="31">her gay and gli&s;tering Suitors would divide or at lea&s;t divert her Attention from you; and I purpo&s;ely laid all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Hou&s;e on your Shoulders, that &s;he might have as little of your Company as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I further had the Precaution to warn my Child again&s;t the Danger of any Affec|tion for you. <HI>Matty,</HI> &s;aid I, one Day, among all this A&s;&s;embly of fair and fortu|nate Youths you are free and welcome to chu&s;e your Companion for Life, there is only One who &s;tands excepted, One only whom you mu&s;t not look upon with any Eye of Expectation. Who is that, Pa|pa? My young Brother and Partner in Trade, &s;aid I. He looks much higher, <HI>Matty,</HI> than to the Daughter of a Mer|chant. His Pro&s;pects are immen&s;e. He is only Brother and Heir to the Earl of <HI>Moreland</HI> who is now on his Travels, a di&s;&s;olute young Man, who&s;e Vices in all likelihood will quickly carry him off, and, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, our <HI>Harry Clinton</HI> would be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t Per&s;on in the Land.</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, I cried, I may ble&s;s your Pro|hibition with regard to me, it was certain|ly the happy, the only Cau&s;e of my <HI>Ma|tilda</HI>'s Partiality in my Favour. The good Man &s;miled and proceeded. Not|with&s;tanding what I &s;aid to <HI>Matty,</HI> I had not given up all Thoughts of you my&s;elf.
<PB N="33" REF="32">While &s;he talked or &s;ung in your Pre|&s;ence, I often turned my Eye upon you, and thought, at times, that I perceived a growing Tenderne&s;s in your Behaviour, which, further Acquaintance, I tru&s;ted, might ripen into Love. But when, in or|der to try you, I propo&s;ed your Advoca|tion in Behalf of <HI>Spelling,</HI> and that you appeared to undertake it with Readine&s;s and Plea&s;ure, I at once dropped all my fond and flattering Hopes concerning you, and I heartily wi&s;hed that my Child had accepted that mode&s;t and worthy young Man. Ble&s;&s;ed, however, be the favour|ing Hand of that Providence who, &s;o un|expectedly, hath conducted Matters to the I&s;&s;ue of this Hour, and fulfilled the capital Wi&s;h of my Life. But, I will no longer delay carrying to my dear Child the glad Tidings of your Affection; it will prove the be&s;t of Balms to her wounded Mind, and will clo&s;e her Eyes, for this Night, in Re&s;t and Peace of Heart.</P>
<P>I was &s;carce dre&s;&s;ed the next Morning, when <HI>Matilda</HI>'s favourite Maid enter'd my Chamber and bid me good Morrow. Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> &s;aid I, your plea&s;ant Countenance bids me pre&s;ume that Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> is bet|ter. &mdash; O, va&s;tly better, va&s;tly better, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you; &s;he &s;lept &s;weetly all the Night, and did not want for happy Dreams either, I warrant.&mdash;Here is &s;ome|thing
<PB N="34" REF="33">for your good News&mdash;No Sir, no, I never take Money from Gentlemen; my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Genero&s;ity does not leave me to the Temptation. I love my Mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir, and I think we ought all rather to join and fee you, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> as well for Ye&s;|terday's Vi&s;it, as for another which I hope you will pay her to Day. A Fiddle for the&s;e old Doctors, one pretty young Doc|tor is better worth than a Score of them.&mdash;<HI>Su&s;an,</HI> as it &s;hould &s;eem, had been an Ob&s;erver, and did not want for Penetration in &s;uch Matters.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;he continu|ed, I'd give my la&s;t Quarter's Wages to know what Charm it is that you carry about you, to make all the pretty Ladies &s;o fond of you.&mdash;In Truth, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> I am equally a Stranger to the Charm and to the Fondne&s;s that you talk of. &mdash; Don't tell me, Sir, don't tell me. The very Day of that Night on which my Mi&s;tre&s;s fell &s;ick, here was a Lady in her Chariot to enquire for you, one of the lovelie&s;t young Creatures I ever &s;et my Eyes on. I know &s;he a&s;ked very particularly and ve|ry affectionately for you; for though it was my Mi&s;tre&s;s to whom &s;he &s;poke, I &s;tood within hearing.&mdash;It mu&s;t, I cried, have been &s;ome Mi&s;take or &s;ome Impo&s;|ture, for I a&s;&s;ure you, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> that I know of no &s;uch Per&s;on. But pray be &s;o good as to bear my Compliments to your
<PB N="35" REF="34">young Lady, and tell her that I wait her Permi&s;&s;ion to attend her.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, Madam, that, agreeable to the Advice which Mr. <HI>Gold|ing</HI> had given me, I went to felicitate my Uncle <HI>Goodall</HI> on his Marriage with your Mother. He had already been informed of my recent Admi&s;&s;ion into Partner&s;hip, and thereupon received me with very un|u&s;ual Marks of E&s;teem and Affection.</P>
<P>Your Mother, at that Time, was ex|ceeding lovely in her Per&s;on and Manners, at every Sea&s;on of Lei&s;ure I frequented their Hou&s;e, and &s;he conceived a very tender and warm Friend&s;hip for me, but, during Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI>'s Illne&s;s, I had not been to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an</HI> was but ju&s;t gone, when Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> came and told me that he believed his <HI>Matty</HI> would be plea&s;ed to &s;ee me. I in&s;tantly obeyed the Summons. As I en|ter'd I ob&s;erved that &s;he &s;at up in her Bed, a Morning Gown was wrapped about her, and <HI>Su&s;an</HI> with the Help of Pillows &s;up|ported her behind. On my appearing her Spirits again took the Alarm. She &s;carce ventured a Glance toward me. I was greatly pained by the Aba&s;hment under which I &s;aw &s;he laboured, and I ha&s;tened
<PB N="36" REF="35">to relieve my&s;elf as well as her from the Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;at down by the Bed-&s;ide, and gently taking one of her Hands, without looking in her Face, my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Golding,</HI> &s;aid I, I hope you will not be jealous of your Papa's Affection for me. He has, indeed, been too partial, too generous toward me, and has approved him&s;elf more than a Fa|ther to me. He is not &s;atisfied with allow|ing me to call you by the tender Name of Si&s;ter, he further gives me Leave to hope that I may be united to you by the neare&s;t and deare&s;t of all Ties. Nothing but your Con&s;ent is wanting, my Si&s;ter, to make me the happie&s;t of Mankind. You are &s;ilent, my <HI>Matilda,</HI> may I ven|ture to call you mine? Ble&s;s'd be your Si|lence, my Angel, I will dare then to inter|pret it in my own Favour?&mdash;Indeed I &s;hould long &s;ince have made the pre&s;ent Declaration, I &s;hould long &s;ince have avow|ed my Inclinations, my Affection, my Pa&s;|&s;ion for you; but I did not pre&s;ume to li&s;ten to my own Heart on the Occa&s;ion, I did not &s;uffer it to tell me how much you were beloved. Amid&s;t &s;o many Suitors of the fir&s;t Rank and Merit, who were ju&s;tly called together by your numberle&s;s Attrac|tions, I deemed it a Flight by much too high for me to a&s;pire at a Competition for the Happine&s;s of your Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
Here, venturing to look up, I percei|ved that &s;he had put her Handkerchief to her Eyes. Ah! Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> &s;he cried with a trembling Voice, you are very delicate, you are &s;weetly delicate indeed; but ought I to take the Advantage of this Delicacy? I &s;ee that you would &s;ave me from the Confu&s;ion of an Avowal, you would &s;ave me from the mortifying Sen&s;ibility of my own Weakne&s;s. But, Sir, you ought not to e&s;teem that a Weakne&s;s in me, which I account my chiefe&s;t Merit and which is my chiefe&s;t Pride. I am proud of my Gratitude, I am proud of my Di&s;cernment. From the Moment that you pre&s;erved me, again&s;t Arms and again&s;t Odds, at the great Peril of your own Life, in you, and you alone, I &s;aw every thing that was amiable, every thing that was excellent. But then I dreaded le&s;t all Women &s;hould behold you with my Eyes; and, above all, I doubly dreaded and was fearfully a&s;&s;ured that you never would have any Eyes or At|tention for me. You have at length &s;een, or are rather informed concerning my Mala|dy. You pity me, you wi&s;h to relieve me, and you would love me if you could. It is enough, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> even this perhaps is quite as much of Happine&s;s as I can bear.</P>
<P>Here, again, I began to profe&s;s and to prote&s;t the Sincerity and Ardour of my Af|fections;
<PB N="38" REF="37">but &s;he cut me &s;hort and &s;aid, I know your Sincerity, Sir, you are per&s;uad|ed that you love me, becau&s;e as yet you know not what Love is. True Love, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> by its own Light, &s;ees into and throughout the Bo&s;om of the Party belov|ed: I am very &s;en&s;ible of the Tenderne&s;s of your Friend&s;hip for me, and that Sen|&s;ibility con&s;titutes the Whole of my Hap|pine&s;s. I tru&s;t al&s;o that it is all the Hap|pine&s;s I &s;hall ever de&s;ire. To &s;ee you, to hear you, to have you with me, to gaze upon you while you are looking another Way, to be permitted to attend, to &s;erve you, to conduce to your Satisfactions, it is a Lot that will lift me above that of Mortality, that will cau&s;e me to account my&s;elf the fir&s;t among Women.</P>
<P>Ah, I cried, can I &s;ay nothing, can I do nothing to convince you how dear, how exceedingly dear you are to me? I certain|ly loved you, long before I knew what it was to be a Lover. I now feel the united Force of tho&s;e imperceptible Degrees by which the plea&s;ing Intruder daily &s;tole and grew upon me. Believe me, my <HI>Matilda,</HI> when I pre&s;umed to pre&s;ent you with this as a Token of my Affection, I held it for a Trifle altogether unworthy of you; accept it, however, I be&s;eech you, for the Sake of the Giver!</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
And, is this the Gem, &s;ays &s;he, which I ca&s;t from me with &s;uch Di&s;dain?&mdash;For|give me, my Brother, it is ju&s;t &s;o that the World ca&s;ts from them the Pearl of much mightier Price. I would to Heaven, that I could reject all the Pomps, Plea&s;ures and Vanities of this tran&s;itory World with the &s;ame Aver&s;ion that I &s;purned from me this e&s;timable Jewel; but there is very lit|tle Hope of that, Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> while you your&s;elf may be partly numbered among tran&s;itory Things.</P>
<P>Here I was quite overcome by the Af|fection of the dear Girl, and, urged on by a &s;udden Tran&s;port, I caught her to my Bo&s;om with a Force that was &s;omething too much for her Weakne&s;s. On Recol|lection, I attempted to apologize for my Indi&s;cretion, but &s;he &s;weetly cried, Ah! Mr. <HI>Harry,</HI> never repent of &s;uch Faults, may I often, may I daily tempt you to be guilty of them. But tell me, and tell me truly, Mr. <HI>Clinton;</HI> the&s;e Gems, when you fir&s;t purcha&s;ed them, were they actually intended for me? were they not rather in|tended for your <HI>Fanny,</HI> for your own <HI>Fanny,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clinton?</HI> What can you mean? I ex|claimed, I know of no <HI>Fanny</HI> in the Uni|ver&s;e, with whom I have any Acquaint|ance. That is &s;trange! &s;he replied, very
<PB N="40" REF="39">extraordinary, indeed! but, le&s;t you &s;hould think me of a jealous or whim&s;ical Tem|per, I will relate the Affair to you pre|ci&s;ely, as it happened.</P>
<P>On the Day, in which I took to my Bed, I was looking out at the Parlout Window, when a Chariot and &s;ix Hor&s;es whirled up to our Door. I ob&s;erved a &s;ingle Lady in it, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed of my Acquaintance, and in&s;tantly &s;ent <HI>Su&s;an</HI> to reque&s;t her to walk in. On her entering, I was greatly &s;truck by the Beauty of her Figure, and eyed her very inqui&s;itively from Head to Foot. Having curte&s;ied gracefully to me, can you tell me, Mi&s;s, &s;ays &s;he, is Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> at Home? No, indeed, Madam, &s;aid I; but if you will be plea&s;ed to entru&s;t me with your Commands&mdash;It is only, Mi&s;s, that I reque&s;t to &s;ee him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible &mdash; And, pray Madam, where &s;hall he at|tend you&mdash;O, he will know that in&s;tantly, when you tell him it was <HI>Fanny Goodall,</HI> his own <HI>Fanny Goodall</HI> who was here to wait upon him.&mdash;Good Heaven, I cried out, my Aunt, my Aunt <HI>Goodall,</HI> my very Aunt I a&s;&s;ure you!&mdash;What do you &s;ay, what do you tell me, your Aunt, Sir, can it be? Ah, &s;he is too young, and too lovely to be an Aunt, Mr. <HI>Harry.</HI>&mdash;The very &s;ame, indeed, Madam, there is no other <HI>Fanny Goodall.</HI> I admit, as you &s;ay, that &s;he is
<PB N="41" REF="40">young and exceeding lovely, but &s;till &s;he is a Wife, and likely &s;oon, as I think, to be a Mother. Alas, &s;ays my <HI>Matilda,</HI> what a doleful Je&s;t is this! a cruel Aunt &s;he has been to me I am &s;ure, what Days of Sighs and Nights of Tears &s;he has co&s;t me! Ah, that heart-breaking Term, <HI>his own, his own Fanny;</HI> I think I &s;hall never be able to forgive her that Expre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> ju&s;t then entered, we dropped the Subject we were upon. Why, <HI>Matty,</HI> &s;ays he, you are quite another Crea|ture; I think I never &s;aw you wear &s;o happy a Face. I know you are come to chide me, &s;ays &s;he, for keeping your Partner from Bu&s;ine&s;s; but pay me down the Portion you intended for me, Papa, and I will re|imbur&s;e you the Damage of every Hour of his Ab&s;ence. Yes, my Love, cries the tender Father, if Wealth might &s;erve, for Wages, to a Heart like that of my <HI>Harry,</HI> he &s;hall be very amply payed for every Act and In&s;tance of his Affection and At|tention to you. Every Hour of my Life, I cried, is already her Due; &s;he has no|thing to pay to One who is her Debtor be|yond Account.</P>
<P>During &s;everal following Days, Mi&s;s <HI>Golding</HI> recovered with amazing Rapidity. In le&s;s than than five Weeks &s;he looked
<PB N="42" REF="41">plumper and fairer than ever. Peace &s;miled in her Countenance. Joy laughed in her Eyes. Her whole Frame appeared as actuated by &s;ome internal Mu&s;ic. And thus, all lovely and beloved, &s;he was given up to my Arms, in the Pre&s;ence of my Uncle and Aunt and of a few City Friends.</P>

<P>As I wi&s;h that none of your Faults &s;hould pa&s;s by me unnoticed, &s;o I am willing to allow you all your ju&s;t Prai&s;es. Your Story of your old Friend is, hither|to, very &s;imple, natural, and dome&s;tic; and to a Mind, yet undebauched, exceedingly intere&s;ting and affecting; for it opens and inve&s;tigates a Number of little Pa&s;&s;ages and Mazes in the Heart, which are quite clo&s;ed, or imperceptible to Per&s;ons of hard Nerves and callous Conceptions. I am free, however, to tell you that I felt my&s;elf offended by the Compliments which Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> pays to him&s;elf through the Mouth of your <HI>Matilda.</HI> It is, indeed, a very rare Matter for People to &s;peak of them&s;elves with due Decency and Delicacy.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>HERE the Counte&s;s, for the fir&s;t Time, broke in upon her Cou&s;in's Narration. Happy <HI>Matilda,</HI> &s;he cried, how di&s;tingui&s;h'd was thy De&s;tiny! were it but for a Year, were it but for a Day, for that Day thou did&s;t yet enjoy the Con|&s;ummation of all thy Wi&s;hes, a Lot rarely allowed to any Daughter of <HI>Adam.</HI> I was not then born to envy her State. Sweet Girl, &s;he de&s;erved you, &s;he was after my own Heart, the Exce&s;s of her Pa&s;&s;ion for you made her truly worthy of you. But tell me, my Cou&s;in, how could you be &s;o long ignorant of the dear Girl's Affection for you? The Language of Love is &s;o very intelligible, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive through e|very Motion and every Organ, as mu&s;t, with &s;ufficient Clearne&s;s, have opened your Eyes to the Object. Indeed, Madam, re|plied Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> &s;he her&s;elf led me away from any &s;uch Apprehen&s;ion, by drawing &s;o many Pictures of the Man whom &s;he &s;aid &s;he loved, all copied from the Crea|ture of her own Brain, and covered and di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;uch imaginary Excellencies as mu&s;t have prevented my&s;elf, as well as every one living, from perceiving therein the &s;malle&s;t Trace of my own Re&s;em|blance. Don't tell me, cried Lady <HI>Mait|land,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="44">&s;he was a true and a &s;weet Painter, and I &s;hould have known you by her Portrait in the Mid&s;t of a Million. But proceed, I be&s;eech you, my whole Soul is in your Story.</P>
<P>Within a few Months after my Mar|riage, continued Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> you, my Cou&s;in, fir&s;t opened your fair Eyes to the Light, and my <HI>Matty</HI> and I had the Ho|nour of being your Spon&s;ors.</P>
<P>Within the fir&s;t Year of my Marriage, my Girl, al&s;o, brought a Son into the World, and within the two Years follow|ing was deliver'd of a Daughter.</P>
<P>The Joy of the Grandfather, on tho&s;e Events, was inde&s;cribable. Alas, good Man! he thought that he perceived, in their infant A&s;pects, a thou&s;and happy Promi&s;es and opening Pro&s;pects. He &s;aw him&s;elf, as it were, perpetuated in a de|&s;cending and widening Progeny, who, like their native <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;hould roll down in a Tide of expanding Wealth and Pro&s;peri|ty. He wanted that all the World &s;hould participate of his Happine&s;s, and our Hou&s;e once more became the Hou&s;e of Fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>A Number of external Succe&s;&s;es, al&s;o, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to per&s;uade us, in tho&s;e Days, that
<PB N="46" REF="45">Felicity was to be attained and a&s;certained upon Earth. The Regency of <HI>Cromwel</HI> was admini&s;ter'd with the &s;tricte&s;t Ju&s;tice at Home, while, at the &s;ame Time, it be|came revered and formidable abroad, and extended its Influence to Regions the mo&s;t remote. Under the Protection of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Flag, we &s;ent our Ships out to the Ea&s;t, and to the We&s;t, and Wealth came pouring in upon us from all Quarters of the Globe.</P>
<P>In the mean while, my Wife and I lived together in perfect Harmony. Though my Commerce and Acquaintance was greatly extended, I had yet formed no Friend&s;hips, from Home, that partook of heart-felt Tenderne&s;s, except for your Mama. All my Plea&s;ures and De&s;ires, all my World was, in a Manner, confined and ab&s;orbed within the Compa&s;s of my own Walls. In the good old Man and his Daughter, and in the Pledges of their endearing Attachment to me, every Wi&s;h that my Soul could form was centered. Mutual Joy &s;at round our Board, mutual Peace prepared our Pillows, and, during a &s;wimming Period of &s;ix Years, I &s;carce remember to have experienced the &s;malle&s;t Di&s;content, &s;ave what aro&s;e from the In|ordinancy of my Wife's Affection for me.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46">
While &s;he continued to ble&s;s my Arms, I thought that no one had ever loved with greater Warmth than I loved her; and yet, at Times I remarked a very &s;triking Difference between the Manner and Effects of our Feelings for each other. If Bu&s;ine&s;s detained me an Hour extraordi|nary abroad, the panting of her Bo&s;om, that Eagerne&s;s of Look with which &s;he received me, was to me a painful Evi|dence of her Anxiety during my Ab&s;ence. One Evening I found her in fainting Fits, merely becau&s;e &s;he was told that a Duel had ju&s;t happened between Lord <HI>Mohun</HI> and a Per&s;on who had much the Re&s;emblance of her <HI>Clinton.</HI> In &s;hort, if my Head or my Finger ached, I found my&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of concealing my Ailment, and of a&s;&s;uming a Chearfulne&s;s di&s;agreeable to the Occa&s;ion, to prevent the wor&s;e Con|&s;equences of her ready Alarms. On the other Hand, my Affection was tranquil and &s;erene; it was tender and fervent, in|deed, but without Tumult or Di&s;turbance; a Species of Love which I afterwards found to be by far the mo&s;t eligible; for every kind of Pa&s;&s;ion is unque&s;tionably a kind of Suffering; Love in God, therefore, mu&s;t be wholly an Action, it acts infinitely upon Others without any Po&s;&s;ibility of be|ing acted upon.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47">
Thus the Years of my Life moved on|ward upon Down, when the Small-pox, that capital Enemy to Youth and Beauty, became epidemical in the City. Our Chil|dren caught the Contagion. All po&s;&s;ible Care was taken, and all po&s;&s;ible Art em|ployed. A Number of Phy&s;icians was kept con&s;tantly about them. Fifteen Days of their Illne&s;s were already elap&s;ed, and the Doctors pronounced them out of Danger; when the Di&s;temper took a &s;udden and malignant Turn, and, in one and the &s;ame Minute, both my Babes expired in the Arms of their Mother.</P>
<P>I was in the Room, at the Time, and as I knew the extreme Tenderne&s;s of my <HI>Matty</HI>'s Nature, all my Concern, as well as Attention, was turned upon her. I took her fondly by the Hand, and, looking up to her Face, I was in&s;tantly alarmed and &s;hocked by that placid Serenity which appeared in her Countenance, and which I expected to be quickly changed into &s;ome frantic Eruption. But, fir&s;t drop|ping a &s;miling Tear on her Infants, and then lifting her gli&s;tening Eyes to Heaven, I thank thee, I thank thee, O my Ma&s;ter, &s;he cried, thou ha&s;t made me of &s;ome U&s;e, I have not been born in vain; thou ha&s;t ordained me the humble Vehicle of two &s;afe and certain Angels, living Attendants
<PB N="49" REF="48">on thy Throne, and &s;weet Singers of thy Prai&s;es in the Kingdom of little Children, for ever and for ever. I have yet &s;uffici|ent left, more Ble&s;&s;ings remaining than &s;uit the Lot of Mortality; take me from them, I be&s;eech thee, whenever it is thy good Plea&s;ure, for I fear there are &s;ome of them, which I could not, I could not bear to have taken away from me. So prayed the dear Saint, and looking eagerly at me, no, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;he cried out, I fear, I fear I could not bear it! So &s;aying, &s;he &s;uddenly ca&s;t her&s;elf into my Bo&s;om, and gra&s;ping at my Neck, and gu&s;hing into a Flood of Angui&s;h, we mingled our Sobs and our Tears together till no more were left to be &s;hed.</P>
<P>You are affected, my deare&s;t Cou&s;in, I had better &s;top here. If you are moved by &s;mall Matters, how would your Heart be wrung by &s;ome en&s;uing Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; I mu&s;t not venture to proceed.</P>
<P>Go on, cried the Counte&s;s, go on, I in&s;i&s;t upon it. I love to weep, I joy to grieve, it is my Happine&s;s, my Delight to have my Heart broken in Pieces.</P>
<P>We were, both of us; much relieved by the vent of our mutual Pa&s;&s;ion, for, though my Wife &s;till continued to keep to me and cling about me, &s;he yet &s;eemed to be
<PB N="50" REF="49">&s;weetly compo&s;ed, and &s;unk, within my Arms, as into a Bed and Depth of Peace.</P>
<P>At length, I li&s;tened to a Kind of Mur|mur and Bu&s;tle in the Hall, and I heared &s;ome one di&s;tinctly cry, O my Ma&s;ter, my Ma&s;ter!</P>
<P>We &s;tarted up at the In&s;tant. Mr. <HI>Gold|ing</HI> had been from Home at the time of the deadly Cri&s;is of my two darling little Ones, and had quieted all his Fears, and renewed all his Pro&s;pects, in the View and full A&s;&s;urance of their Life and quick Recovery. We had been too much engaged and oc|cupied, in our own per&s;onal Griefs, to give to our Servants the &s;ea&s;onable Precaution of breaking the Matter to our Father by unalarming Degrees; and a rude Fellow, at his Entrance, bluntly told him that the Children were both dead; whereupon he clapped his Hands together, and, ca&s;ting him&s;elf into a Chair, remained without Sen&s;e or Motion.</P>
<P>When we ran up, we were greatly ter|rified by the Manner of his A&s;pect, though his Eyes were clo&s;ed, his Brows were gloomy and contracted, while the nether Part of his Face looked quiet and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly &s;ent for a Surgeon, and recall|ed the Phy&s;icians who had but lately left
<PB N="51" REF="50">us; while my <HI>Matty</HI> &s;tood motionle&s;s, with her Hands clo&s;ed together and her Eyes fixed upon her Father. At length &s;he cried out, my Papa, my Papa, my dear Papa, I would I would I had died before I came to this Hour! but, ble&s;&s;ed be thy Will &s;ince it is thy Will, O God! when all other Props are &s;apped and plucked from under me I tru&s;t to fall into thee, my Father which art in Heaven!</P>
<P>Being put to Bed, and bled, he recovered Motion and Speech, and we got him to &s;wallow a compo&s;ing Draught, though he did not yet recollect any Per&s;on or Thing about him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our late Fatigues, <HI>Mat|ty</HI> and I &s;at up with him mo&s;t of the Night; and then, ordering a Pallet to be brought into the Room, we lay down to take a lit|tle Re&s;t toward Morning. Alas, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, how rich was I Ye&s;terday, how is my World abridged! the&s;e narrow Walls now contain all that is left me of all the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that I value upon Earth.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> was but ill qualified to bear Calamity. His Life had been a Life of &s;ound Health and Succe&s;&s;es; and he never had been acquainted with Sickne&s;s, or with Affliction, &s;ave on the Death of his Wife whom he had married for Money,
<PB N="52" REF="51">and on the Illne&s;s of his Daughter as al|ready related.</P>
<P>As he had taken an Opiate, he did not awaken till it was late in the Day. Turn|ing his Head toward me, is it you, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he? How do you find your&s;elf, Sir, &s;aid I? &mdash; Why, has any thing been the Matter with me? Indeed I don't feel my&s;elf right; but, &s;end my Children to me; &s;end my <HI>Jacky</HI> and my little <HI>Harriet;</HI> the Sight of them will be a Re&s;torative beyond all the Cordials in the World. &mdash; You are &s;ilent, <HI>Harry</HI> &mdash; What is the meaning? &mdash; O, now I begin to remember &mdash; my &s;weet Babies, my little Play-fellows, I &s;hall never &s;ee you any more!</P>
<P>Here, he bur&s;t into the mo&s;t violent Gu&s;h of Pa&s;&s;ion. He groaned, he wept, he cried aloud with heart-piercing Exclama|tions, while I caught up <HI>Matty</HI> in my Arms, and, running with her to a di&s;tant Apart|ment, catched a Ki&s;s and locked her in.</P>
<P>I returned, but found him in the &s;ame Violence of Agitation. I &s;poke to him, I would have comforted him; but he cried, be quiet, <HI>Harry,</HI> I will not be comforted. I will go to my Children, they &s;hall not be torn from me, we will die, we will be buried, we will lie in the &s;ame Grave to|gether.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52">
As I found my&s;elf &s;ick, and ready to faint under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of his Lamen|tations, I withdrew to the next Chamber, and there plentifully vented the contagious Shower.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time I li&s;tened and perceived that all was quiet, and returning, I found him in a kind of troubled Doze, from whence he fell into a deep and peaceful Sleep. Thus he continued, for three Days, wailing and &s;lumbring by Fits, without ta&s;ting any Matter of Nouri&s;hment, though his Daughter and I implored him, on our Knees, and with Tears. No Rea&s;onings, no Entreaties could avail for appea&s;ing him, it was from the A&s;&s;ociation of our Sorrows alone that he appeared to admit of any Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>At length his Pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided into a &s;ullen and &s;ilent Calm; he would &s;peak to no body, he would an&s;wer none of us except by Mono&s;yllables.</P>
<P>Within a few following Weeks, News was brought me that our Ship the Phoenix was arrived in the <HI>Downs,</HI> &s;afe and richly laden from the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Immediately I carried the Tidings to the old Man, in the plea&s;ing Expectation that
<PB N="54" REF="53">they would &s;erve to divert, or, at lea&s;t, to amu&s;e his Melancholy. But, fixing his Look upon me, wherefore, <HI>Harry,</HI> do&s;t thou tell me of Ships and Indies, he cried; both Indies are poor to me, they have nothing that they can &s;end me. I have no Road to go upon Earth, no Way upon Sea to navi|gate, I am already become a wild and wa&s;ted <HI>Babylon,</HI> wherein the Voice of Mu&s;ic &s;hall never more be heared. O ye old and unble&s;s'd Knees, where are now your pre|cious Babies, who were wont to play about ye, and to cling and climb upon ye? gone, gone, gone, gone, never, never to return.</P>
<P>Here, breaking into Tears, I cried, we are both young yet, my Father, we may yet have many Children to be the Comfort of your Age. No, my <HI>Harry,</HI> no, he re|plied, you may, indeed, have many Chil|dren but you never will have any Children like my darling Children.</P>
<P>Love, as it &s;hould &s;eem, my Cou&s;in, like Bodies, has its Weight, and gains additi|onal Velocity in the De&s;cent. It de&s;cends from God to his Creatures, and &s;o from Creature to Creature, but rarely knows a due Return of Affection or Gratitude. It is therefore incomparably more inten&s;e in the Parent than in the Child, and &s;till acquires encrea&s;ing Fondne&s;s toward the Grand|child and &s;o downward. Nay, you may,
<PB N="55" REF="54">almo&s;t univer&s;ally, ob&s;erve it more warm in Patrons toward their Dependents, than in tho&s;e who are benefitted toward their Benefactors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> from this Time, no more entered his Counting-hou&s;e, nor paid nor received Vi&s;its, nor kept up any Corre&s;|pondence. Even my Company and that of his Daughter appeared to oppre&s;s him, and he rarely left his Apartment, where an old folio Bible was his only Companion.</P>
<P>Hereupon I began to withdraw our Effects from Trade, and having called in the be&s;t Part of them, I lodged near Half a Million in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Funds. When I went to advi&s;e with my Father on the Occa&s;ion, what, my Child, &s;aid he, what have I to &s;ay to the World, or to the Things of the World? Do ju&s;t as you plea&s;e with the one and with the other; and never con&s;ult a Per&s;on on any Affair wherein the Party con&s;ulted has no Intere&s;t or Concern.</P>
<P>One Morning, as I lay in Bed, <HI>Matty</HI> threw her Arms about me, and hiding her blu&s;hing Face in my Bo&s;om, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, if you could hand&s;omely bring it about to my poor Papa, perhaps it would be &s;ome Matter of Con&s;olation to him to know that I am with Child.</P>

When I broke the Matter to him, he did not, at fir&s;t, appear to be &s;en&s;ibly affected; in time, however, the Weight of his Affliction &s;eemed con&s;iderably light|ened, and, as my Wife advanced in her Pregnancy, he began to look us in the Face, he &s;at with us at one Table, and became conver&s;able as formerly.</P>
<P>One Day I went to dine with Mr. <HI>Settle,</HI> a Hardware Merchant, who had appointed to pay me a large Sum of Money. On my Return in the Evening, through <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> attended only by my favourite <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> a very faithful and active Fellow, though it was yet fair Day, I was &s;uddenly &s;et upon by a Po&s;&s;e of Robbers, who ru&s;hed on me from behind a Cover. The fir&s;t of them, running up, fired directly in my Face, but did me no further Damage than by carry|ing away a &s;mall Piece of the upper Part of my left Ear. Had the Fools demanded my Money, I would have given it to them at a Word; but, finding them bent on Murder, I re&s;olved that they &s;hould have my Life at as dear a Rate as po&s;&s;ible. I in&s;tantly drew my Sword, and run the fir&s;t through the Body; and then, ru&s;hing on the &s;econd A&s;&s;ailant, I laid him al&s;o on the Ground, before he had Time to take his Aim, &s;o that his Pi&s;tol went harmle&s;ly off in his Fall.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56">
In the mean while, my brave and lov|ing Companion was not idle; with two Strokes of his oaken Cudgel he had levelled two more of them with the Earth. Here|upon the Remainder halted, retreated into a Group, and then &s;tood and fired upon us altogether; but, ob&s;erving that we did not drop, they ca&s;t their Arms to the Ground, and run off &s;everal Ways as fa&s;t as they could. My good Friend, <HI>Tirlah O'Donnoh,</HI> then turned affectionately to me; are you hurt, my dear Ma&s;ter, &s;ays he? I believe I am, <HI>Tirlah,</HI> let us make Home the be&s;t we can. O, cried the noble Creature, if no body was hurt but <HI>Tirlah, Tirlah</HI> would'nt be hurt at all.</P>
<P>Here, taking me under the Arm, we walked &s;lowly to the City, till coming to a hackney Coach he put me, tenderly, into, it, and &s;itting be&s;ide me, &s;upported me, as I began to grow weak through much Effu&s;ion of Blood.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we got Home, the Coach|man, as is their Practice, thundered at the Door, and my <HI>Matty,</HI> according to Cu&s;tom whenever I was abroad, was the readie&s;t of all our Dome&s;tics to open.</P>
<P>By this Time I had fainted, and was quite in&s;en&s;ible, but when my tender and
<PB N="58" REF="57">true Mate &s;aw me borne by two Men into her Pre&s;ence, all pale and bloody, &s;he, who thought &s;he had Fortitude to &s;upport the Wreck of the World, gave a Shriek that was enough to alarm the Neighbour|hood, and in&s;tantly falling backward, got a violent Contu&s;ion in the hinder Part of her Head.</P>
<P>Immediately we were conveyed to &s;epa|rate Beds, and all requi&s;ite Help was pro|vided. It was found that I had received &s;ix or &s;even fle&s;h Wounds, but none of them proved dangerous, as they were given at a Di&s;tance and by Pi&s;tol Shot. But, alas, my <HI>Matty</HI>'s Ca&s;e was very different, &s;he fell into &s;udden and premature Labour, and, having &s;uffered extreme Angui&s;h all the Night, during which &s;he cea&s;ed not to en|quire after me, &s;he was with Difficulty de|livered of a male Infant, who was &s;uffo|cated in the Birth.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the good and tender|hearted old Gentleman hurried about, in|ce&s;&s;antly, from One of us to the Other, wringing his Hands, and &s;carcely retaining his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Wounds were dre&s;&s;ed, and I had recovered my Memory, I looked about, and ha&s;tily enquired for my Wife; but they cautiou&s;ly an&s;wer'd me, that &s;he
<PB N="59" REF="58">was &s;omething indi&s;po&s;ed with the Fright which &s;he got at &s;eeing me bloody, and that her Father had in&s;i&s;ted on her going to Bed.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Dre&s;&s;ing of my Wounds, I was pronounced out of Danger, and then they ventured to tell me of my <HI>Matty</HI>'s Mi&s;carriage, and of the Brui&s;e which &s;he had got in her Fall when &s;he fainted. On hearing this my Heart was cleft, as it were, in twain; I accu&s;ed my&s;elf of the Murder of my Wife and Infant; and I ac|cu&s;ed All, without Exception, of their In|di&s;cretion in not concealing my Di&s;a&s;ter from her.</P>
<P>At Times I began to fear that my Wife was either dead, or much wor&s;e than they repre&s;ented. On my third Dre&s;&s;ing, there|fore, I peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted on my being carried into her Chamber. I &s;ent her Notice of my Vi&s;it, and, on entering the Room, he lives then, &s;he cried, my Hu&s;band, my <HI>Harry</HI> lives, it is enough, I &s;hall die hap|py, I &s;hall now depart in Peace.</P>
<P>Here I ordered my&s;elf to be laid by her Side, when taking a Hand, which &s;he had feebly reached out, and pre&s;&s;ing it to my Lips, you would for&s;ake me then, my <HI>Matty,</HI> you die, you &s;ay, and you die happy in leaving me the mo&s;t wretched, the mo&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="59">de&s;olate of Men. You die, my Love, you die; and I, who would have fo&s;tered you and your Babe with my Vitals, 'tis I who have dug a Grave for the One and for the Other. But, you mu&s;t not for&s;ake me, my <HI>Matty,</HI> I will not be for&s;aken by you. Since we cannot live a&s;under, let us die, let us die together!</P>
<P>Here, a pa&s;&s;ionate Silence en&s;ued on ei|ther Part. But, my Wounds growing painful and beginning to bleed afre&s;h, I was obliged to be carried back to my own Apartment.</P>
<P>Within a few Days more, I was &s;o well recovered as to be able to walk about, from which time I was a con&s;tant Attend|ant on my Beloved, and became her mo&s;t tender and a&s;&s;iduous Nur&s;ekeeper.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have heard, my Cou&s;in, that the Cu&s;toms and Manners of tho&s;e Times were altogether the Rever&s;e of what they are at pre&s;ent. Hypocri&s;y is no longer a Fault among Men, all now is avowed Libertini&s;m and open Profanene&s;s; and Children &s;coff at the Name and Profe&s;&s;ion of that Religion which their Fathers rever|ed. On the contrary, in tho&s;e Days, all Men were either real or pretended Zealots; every Mechanic profe&s;&s;ed, like <HI>Aaron,</HI> to carry a <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> about him;
<PB N="61" REF="60">and no Man would engage in any Bu&s;ine&s;s or Bargain, though with an Intent to over|reach his Neighbour, without going apart, as he &s;aid, to con&s;ult the Lord.</P>
<P>My <HI>Matty,</HI> at the &s;ame Time, was the holie&s;t of all Saints, without any Parade of Sanctification. Her's was a Religion, of who&s;e Value &s;he had the daily and hourly Experience; it was indeed a Religion of Power. It held her, as on a Rock, in the Mid&s;t of a turbulent and fluctuating World. It gave her a Peace of Spirit that &s;miled at Provocation. It gave her Comfort in Affliction, Patience in Angui&s;h, Exaltation in Humiliation, and Triumph in Death.</P>
<P>In about five Weeks after her unhappy Mi&s;carriage, &s;he appeared on the Recove|ry, though by very &s;low Degrees, and with A&s;&s;i&s;tance, at Times, &s;at up in her Bed; when her olde&s;t Phy&s;ician, one Morning, called me apart, I am loath, Sir, &s;aid he, very loath to acquaint you with my Ap|prehen&s;ions. I wi&s;h I may be mi&s;taken, but I fear greatly for you, I fear that your dear Lady cannot recover. By the Symp|toms I conjecture that an Ab&s;ce&s;s, or Im|po&s;tume, is forming within her; but a few Days will a&s;certain Matters either for us or again&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="61">
Had all Sorts of evil Tidings come crowding One upon Other, I &s;hould not have been affected as I then was affected. I could not ri&s;e from my Seat to bid the Doctor adieu. My Knees trembled under me; a Swimming came before my Eyes; and a &s;udden Sickne&s;s relaxed and rever&s;ed my whole Frame. Alas, I had not, at that Time, the Re&s;ource of my <HI>Matty;</HI> I had not on the Armour with which &s;he was armed to all I&s;&s;ues and Events. I, how|ever, rai&s;ed my Thoughts to Heaven, in a kind of helple&s;s Acquie&s;cence rather than confident Re&s;ignation. I &s;truggled, not to appear weaker than became my Manhood; and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, Doctors have often been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Having recollected my Strength and Spi|rits the be&s;t I could, I adventured to enter my Wife's Apartment. She was ju&s;t rai&s;|ed in her Bed, from whence her pale and emaciated Countenance looked forth as the Sun, toward his Setting, looks through a &s;ickly Atmo&s;phere, in Confidence of his ari&s;ing in the Fulne&s;s of Morning Glory.</P>
<P>Having cautiou&s;ly and dejectedly &s;eated my&s;elf be&s;ide her, &s;he reached out both her Hands, and, pre&s;&s;ing one of mine be|tween them, I love you no longer, my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;he cried; I love you no longer.
<PB N="63" REF="62">Your Rival, at length, has conquered. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> am the Bride of Another. And yet I love you in a Mea&s;ure, &s;ince in you I love all that is him, or that is his, and that I think is much, a great deal, indeed, of all that is lovely. O, my dear, my &s;weet, mine on|ly Enemy, as I may &s;ay! Riches were no|thing unto me, Plea&s;ures were nothing un|to me, the World was nothing unto me; You, and you only, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;tood between me and my Heaven, between me and my God. Long, and often, and vainly, have I &s;trove and &s;truggled again&s;t you; but my Bridegroom, at length, is become jealous of you; my true Owner calls me from you, and takes me all to him&s;elf! Be not alarmed then, my <HI>Harry,</HI> when I tell you that I mu&s;t leave you. You will grieve for me, you will grieve greatly for me, my Belov|ed! but, give way to the kindly Shower that your Lord &s;hed for his <HI>Lazarus,</HI> and let the Tears of Humanity alleviate and lighten the Weight of your Affliction.&mdash;Ah, my <HI>Harry,</HI> I tremble for you; what a Cour&s;e you have to run!&mdash;what Perils! what Temptations! deliver him from them, my Ma&s;ter, deliver him from them all:&mdash;Again what bli&s;sful Pro&s;pects&mdash;they are gone, they are vani&s;hed!&mdash;I &s;ink, I die under the Weight and Length of &s;uc|ceeding Mi&s;ery!&mdash;Again it opens, all is cleared, and his End, like that of <HI>Job,</HI> is more ble&s;&s;ed than his Beginning.&mdash;Ah,

<P>You have been dreaming, my Love, I &s;aid, you have been dreaming; and the Impre&s;&s;ion &s;till lies heavy and melancholy on your Memory.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;he replied, I have been dreaming indeed; but then my Dreams are much more real then my waking Vi&s;ions. When all Things &s;en&s;ible are &s;hut out, it is then that the Spirit enlarges, grows con&s;cious of its own Activity, its own Power and Pre|&s;cience, and &s;ees by a Light who&s;e Evidence is beyond that of the Sun. I will tell you a Secret, my <HI>Harry,</HI> there is nothing in the Univer&s;e but <HI>Littlene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>Littlene&s;s</HI> of the Creature and the <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> of God, and in the Sen&s;e of this lies the E&s;&s;ence of all Philo&s;ophy and of all Religion. Be content, then, with your Lot, my Hu&s;|band, be content to be little, if you wi&s;h to be great. Become a Nothingne&s;s, an Emptine&s;s, and then your God will bring the Fulne&s;s of his own Immen&s;ity upon you, and will open a World in your Spirit more expanded and more glorious than this &s;urrounding World with all its Lu|minaries.</P>

O, my Angel, I cried, &s;hould any thing happen to you, I &s;hould then be little in|deed. But, I dare not look that Way, for I know, I find, I feel that I could not &s;urvive you.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t &s;urvive me, my <HI>Harry,</HI> nay you will once more be married. I beheld your Bride la&s;t Night. Even now &s;he &s;tands before me, the Si&s;ter of my Spirit, and one of the lovelie&s;t Compo&s;itions of Sin and Death that ever was framed for Di&s;&s;olu|tion. Her, al&s;o, you will lo&s;e; and you will think, nay, you will a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf that no Powers in Heaven or Earth can avail for a Ray of Comfort. In this Life, however, you will finally, unexpectedly, and mo&s;t wonderfully be ble&s;&s;ed; and, &s;oon after, we &s;hall all meet and be more intimately and more endearingly wedded than ever, where yet there is neither marrying nor giving in Marriage.</P>
<P>While &s;he yet &s;poke, her Pains, as the Pains of Labour, again came upon her, and went off, and again returned, after in|termitted Swoonings.</P>
<P>O, my Cou&s;in, what a &s;olemn, what a fearful Thing is Death! all our Inlets of Knowledge and Sen&s;ation clo&s;ed at once! the Sound of Chear and the Voice of Friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="66" REF="65">and the Comfort of Light &s;hut out from us for ever! Nothing before us but a Blackne&s;s and Depth of Oblivion, or, be|yond it, a doubtful and alarming Sen&s;ibility, &s;trange Scenes, and &s;trange Worlds, &s;trange A&s;&s;ociates and &s;trange Perceptions, perhaps of horrid Realities, infinitely wor&s;e than Nonentity; &s;uch are the brighte&s;t Pro&s;pects of Infidelity in Death.</P>
<P>Where, at that Time, are your Scoffers, your Defiers of Futurity? where your merry Companions, who turn their own Eternity into Matter of Laugh and Ridi|cule? dejected and agha&s;t, their Counte|nance wholly fallen, and their Heart &s;unk within them, they all tremble and wi&s;h to believe, in this the Hour of Di&s;&s;olution. They feel their Exi&s;tence &s;apped and &s;ink|ing from under them; and Nature compells them, in the Drowning of their Souls, to cry out, to Something, to any thing, &s;ave, &s;ave, or I peri&s;h!</P>
<P>Far different was the State of my little and lowly <HI>Matty,</HI> my Saint of Saints, at that tremendous Period; where all Others would have &s;unk, there &s;he &s;oared aloft; and &s;he dropped the World and its Wealth, with her Body and all the &s;en&s;ible Affections thereof, with the &s;ame Satisfaction that a
<PB N="67" REF="66">poor Man, ju&s;t come to a great E&s;tate, would drop his tatter'd Garb to put on gorgeous Apparel.</P>
<P>Oh, my Beloved! &s;he would cry in the Mid&s;t of her Pains, I have been weakly through Life, I have been Weakne&s;s it|&s;elf, and therefore not able to take up thy Cro&s;s; but be thou Strong in my Weak|ne&s;s, &s;hew thy Mightine&s;s in me, and then lay it upon me with all its Weight!</P>
<P>Again, after a Swoon, and when her Pangs became exce&s;&s;ive, I refu&s;e not thy Proce&s;s, my Ma&s;ter, &s;he cried. Thy Cro&s;s and thorny Crown they are all my Ambition. Point thy Thorns, twi&s;t them harder, let them pierce into my Soul, &s;o thou &s;uffer me not to fail or fall from thee, I care not.</P>
<P>Think, my Cou&s;in, what I endured upon that Occa&s;ion, my rending Heart &s;hared her Sufferings, and felt Pang for Pang. Nay, I was not far from murmur|ing and que&s;tioning with my God on his putting to &s;uch Tortures the mo&s;t guilt|le&s;s of his Creatures. If the Lambs of thy Flock, I &s;ecretly &s;aid, if thy Lambs are appointed to &s;uch excruciating Sen&s;ations, what mu&s;t be the Portion of &s;uch Sinners as I am?</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="67">
When &s;he drew near the Goal of her ble&s;&s;ed Cour&s;e upon Earth, O my almighty <HI>Sam&s;on!</HI> &s;he faintly cried, thou &s;hake&s;t the two Pillars of my frail and &s;inful Fabric; fini&s;h then thy Conque&s;t in me; down, down with the whole Building ap|pointed to ruin! let no one, O Lord, of mine Enemies or of thine Enemies e&s;cape thy victorious Arm! but &s;lay all tho&s;e by my Death, with whom I have been vainly combating during my Life-time! So &s;ay|ing, her Pains in an In&s;tant for&s;ook her. The Form of her Countenance was &s;ud|denly changed from the Expre&s;&s;ion of Agony into that of Ec&s;ta&s;y. She rai&s;ed her Hands on high, and exerting her&s;elf to follow them, &s;he cried, I come, I come! then &s;ighed and dropped over.&mdash;The Mu&s;cles of her Face &s;till retained the Stamp of the la&s;t Sentiment of her Soul, and while the Body ha&s;tened to be mingled with Earth, it &s;eemed to partake of that Heaven to which its Spirit had been ex|alted.</P>
<P>You may think it odd, deare&s;t Madam, that, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, I have taken no Note of the Man to whom I was tied by every po&s;&s;ible Band of Duty, Gratitude and Affection. The Fact is, that, during the latter Part of my Wife's Illne&s;s, and for &s;ome Weeks after her Death, Mr. <HI>Golding</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="68">was confined to his Chamber by a &s;evere Fit of the Gout, and the Acutene&s;s of his Pains &s;carce permitted him to attend to any other Concern. While my <HI>Matty</HI> lived, therefore, I divided my Time and A&s;&s;iduities as equally as I could between the Daughter and Father, and, at any Inter|vals of Ea&s;e, I u&s;ed to read to him his favourite Pa&s;&s;ages in the Bible.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Saint had expired, I charged the Servants not to give any In|timation of her Death to their Ma&s;ter, but alas, our Silence and our Looks were too &s;ure Indicators of the fatal Tidings; for, from the highe&s;t to the lea&s;t, my <HI>Matty</HI> had been the Idol of the whole Hou&s;e, and her Death appeared to them as the Lo&s;s of every earthly Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having looked, &s;everal times, intently and inqui&s;itively in my Face, well, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> all is over then, I &s;ee, we mu&s;t go to her, but my Child &s;hall no more return to us.&mdash;You are &s;ilent, my <HI>Harry.</HI>&mdash;O thou fell Glutton, Death! I had but one Mor&s;el left for the whole of my Su&s;tenance, and that too thou ha&s;t devoured. Here he gave a deep Groan, and &s;unk into a State of In&s;en&s;ibility, from which, however, he was &s;oon re|covered by the Return of an angui&s;hing Fit of the Gout.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">
When I look back, my fair Cou&s;in, on the Pa&s;&s;ages of my Life; it is a Matter of Amazement to me, that a Creature &s;o frail, &s;o feebly and &s;o delicately con&s;tituted as Man, with Nerves &s;o apt to be racked, and a Heart to be wrung with Angui&s;h, can po&s;&s;ibly endure under the Weights of Cala|mity that, at times, are laid upon him.</P>
<P>I had not yet dropped a Tear. I was in a State of half &s;tupid and half flighty In|&s;en&s;ibility; as One who, having lo&s;t eve|ry thing, had nothing further to look for, and therefore nothing to regard. But, when I &s;aw my dear old Man, my be&s;t Friend, my Father, whelmed under &s;uch a Depth of Affliction, all the Sluices of my Soul and inmo&s;t Affections were laid open, and I broke into an avowed Pa&s;&s;ion of Tears and Exclamations, till, like <HI>David</HI> in his Strife of Love with <HI>Jonathan,</HI> I exceed|ed. I accu&s;ed my&s;elf of all the Evils that had happened to his Hou&s;e; and I devoted the Day to Darkne&s;s and the Night to De&s;olation, wherein, by my Pre&s;ence and Connections, I had brought tho&s;e Mi&s;|chiefs upon him. The good Man was greatly &s;truck, and, I think, partly con&s;oled by the Exce&s;s of my Sorrows, and, all de&s;olate as he was, he attempted to ad|mini&s;ter that Comfort to me which he
<PB N="71" REF="70">him&s;elf wanted more than Any who had Life.</P>
<P>Break not your Heart, my <HI>Harry,</HI> break not your Heart, my Child, he cried! de|prive me not of the only Con&s;olation that is left me; you are now my only Tru&s;t, my only Stay, upon Earth. A wretched Mer|chant I am, who&s;e whole Wealth is ca&s;t away, &s;ave thee, thou precious Ca&s;ket, thou only Remnant of all my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions! My Girl, indeed, was thy true Lover, the tendere&s;t of all Mates; her Love to thee, my Son, was pa&s;&s;ing the Love of Woman; but we have lo&s;t her, we have lo&s;t her, and Wailing is all the Portion that is left us below.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Family heard the Voice of our Mourning, they too gave a Loo&s;e to the Impatience of their Griefs, and all the Hou&s;e was filled with the Sound of Lamentation.</P>
<P>On the following Day I &s;ummoned the chief medical Arti&s;ts, and got the precious Remains of my Angel embalmed. She was laid under a &s;umptuous Canopy with a Silver Coffin at her Bed's Foot, and, every Night when the Hou&s;e was at Re&s;t, I &s;tole &s;ecretly from my Bed and &s;tretched my&s;elf be&s;ide her. I pre&s;&s;ed her cold Lips to mine. I cla&s;p'd her Cor&s;e to my warm
<PB N="72" REF="71">Bo&s;om, as though I expected to re&s;tore it to Life by transfu&s;ing my Soul into it. I &s;poke to her, as when living, I reminded her of the &s;everal tender and endearing Pa&s;&s;ages of our Loves; and I reminded her al&s;o of the Lo&s;s of our little Ones, by whom we became e&s;&s;entially One, in&s;eparably unit|ed in Soul and Body for ever.</P>
<P>There is &s;urely, my Cou&s;in, a Species of Plea&s;ure in Grief; a Kind of &s;oothing and deep Delight that ari&s;es with the Tears which are pu&s;hed from the Fountain of God in the Soul, from the Charities and Sen&s;ibilities of the human Heart divine.</P>
<P>True, true, my precious Cou&s;in, replied the Counte&s;s, giving a fre&s;h Loo&s;e to her Tears; O <HI>Matilda,</HI> I would I were with thee! true, my Cou&s;in, I &s;ay, even now I &s;ink, I die under the Plea&s;ure of your Narration.</P>
<P>Upon the ninth Night, continued Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> as I lay by the Side of all that remained of my <HI>Matty,</HI> overtoiled and overwatched, I fell into a deep Sleep. My Mind notwith&s;tanding, at the Time, &s;eemed more awake and more alive to Objects than ever. In an In&s;tant &s;he &s;tood vi&s;ible and confe&s;&s;ed before me. I &s;aw her clearer than at noon Day, by the Light which &s;he ca&s;t with Profu&s;ion abroad. Every Feature
<PB N="73" REF="72">and former Trace &s;eemed heightened into a Lu&s;tre without a Lo&s;s of the lea&s;t Simi|litude. She &s;miled ineffable Sweetne&s;s and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s upon me. And &s;tooping down, I felt her Embrace about my Heart and about my Spirit, while, at the &s;ame Time, I &s;aw her bent in Complacence before me. After a Length of ec&s;tatic Plea&s;ure, which I felt from her Communion and Infu&s;ion into my Soul; my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, grieve not for me; all the Delights that your World could &s;um up, in an Age, would not a|mount to my Bli&s;s, no, not for an Hour; it is a Weight of Enjoyment that, in an In&s;tant, would cru&s;h to nothing the whole Frame of your Mortality. Grieve not then for me, my <HI>Harry,</HI> but re&s;ign my beggarly Spoils to their beggarly Parent, A&s;hes to A&s;hes and Du&s;t to Du&s;t! In my inordinate Fondne&s;s for you, I have at length obtained a Promi&s;e that my Ma&s;ter and your Ma&s;ter, my Beloved and your Lover &s;hall, finally, bear you triumphant through all the Ene|mies that are &s;et in fearful Array again&s;t you. Having &s;o &s;aid, I felt my&s;elf as it were compre&s;&s;ed within an Engine of Love; and again, lo&s;ing the Remembrance of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;unk, as into a State of utter Oblivion.</P>
<P>Toward the Dawning, I was awakened by the clapping of Hands and the Cries of Lamentation. Starting up, I perceived
<PB N="74" REF="73">Mr. <HI>Golding</HI> at the Bed&s;ide, &s;u&s;pended over his <HI>Matty</HI> and me, and pouring forth his Complaints.</P>
<P>There was a favoured Dome&s;tic of his, a little old Man, who had always kept a careful and inqui&s;itive Eye over every Thing that was in or concerned our Hou&s;ehold, This <HI>Argus,</HI> it &s;eems, at length &s;u&s;pected my nightly Vi&s;its to the Dead, and, lurk|ing in a Corner, &s;aw me open and enter the Chamber where the Corps was depo&s;it|ed. As he lay in his Ma&s;ter's Apartment, he took the fir&s;t Opportunity of his being awake to impart what he thought a Matter of extraordinary Intelligence to him. Sir, &s;ays he, if I am not greatly deceived, my young Ma&s;ter is this Moment in Bed with his dead Lady. What is this you tell me? cried Mr. <HI>Golding.</HI> No, <HI>John,</HI> no, what you &s;ay is impo&s;&s;ible. All who live love that which is living alone; whatever &s;avours of Death is dete&s;table to all Men. As I am here, replied <HI>John,</HI> I am almo&s;t a&s;&s;ured that what I tell you is Fact. Peace, Peace, you old Fool, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> think you that our <HI>Harry</HI> is more loving than Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> and yet <HI>Abraham</HI> de&s;ired to bury his Dead out of his Sight. I know not how that may be, &s;aid tru&s;ty <HI>John,</HI> but, if you are able to &s;tir, I will help you to go and &s;ee, I am &s;ure the Thought of it melts the very Heart within me.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="74">
Accordingly, Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> like old <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;trengthened him&s;elf and aro&s;e, and, pained as he was, he came with the Help of his <HI>John</HI> to the Place where I lay.</P>
<P>Having for &s;ome Time looked upon me, as I &s;lept with his <HI>Matty</HI> fa&s;t folded in my Arms; he could no longer contain his Emotions, but he and <HI>John</HI> broke forth into Tears and Exclamations. O, my Chil|dren, my Children, my deare&s;t Children, he cried, why did ye exalt me to &s;uch a Pitch of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? was it only to ca&s;t me down into the deeper Gulph of Mi&s;ery, a Gulph that has neither Bank nor Bottom?</P>
<P>As I aro&s;e, all a&s;hamed to be detected in that Manner, the good Man caught me in his Arms. My <HI>Harry,</HI> my <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;ays he, what &s;hall I pay you, my Son, for your &s;uperabundant Love to me and to mine? could my Wretchedne&s;s give you Bli&s;s, I &s;hould almo&s;t think my&s;elf ble&s;s'd in being wretched, my <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>I now prepared to execute the late Com|mand of my Angel, and to con&s;ign to Earth the little that was earthly in her. But, when our Dome&s;tics under&s;tood that all that was left of their loved Mi&s;tre&s;s was now going to be taken away from them
<PB N="76" REF="75">for ever, they broke into Tears anew, and &s;et no Bounds to their Lamentations.</P>
<P>Her de&s;olate Father was de&s;irous of at|tending the Funeral, but, on my Knees, I di&s;&s;uaded him from it, as I was a&s;&s;ured it would bur&s;t in twain the already over|&s;tretched Thread of his Age and Infirmi|ties. He then in&s;i&s;ted on having the Lid of the Coffin removed, and bending over, he ca&s;t his old Body on the Cor&s;e; again he ro&s;e and gazed upon it, and clapping his Hands with a Shout, Is this my World, he cried, the Whole of my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Are you the one that was once my little prattling <HI>Matty,</HI> the Playfellow of my Knees, the Laugher away of Care, who brought Chear to my Heart and Warmth to my Bo&s;om? Are you the one for whom, a|lone, I &s;pent my Nights in Thought and my Days in Application? Is this all that is left, then, of my Length of Labours? O, my Spark of Life is quenched; in thee, my <HI>Matty,</HI> my <HI>Matty,</HI> the flowing Foun|tain of my Exi&s;tence is dried up for ever.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething exceedingly &s;olemn and affecting, my Cou&s;in, in the Circum|&s;tances and Apparatus of our Funerals; they are oppre&s;&s;ive even to Minds that are no way concerned or intere&s;ted in the Death of the Party lamented. Though I grieved
<PB N="77" REF="76">no more for my <HI>Matty,</HI> though I was as a&s;&s;ured of her Bli&s;s as I was of my own Be|ing; yet, when the Gloom of the Proce&s;&s;ion was gathered around me, when I heard the Wailings of the many Families whom her Charity had &s;u&s;tained; when I heard the bitter Sobbings of the Servants, whom her Sweetne&s;s had &s;o endearingly attached to her Per&s;on; when all joined to bewail them|&s;elves, as lo&s;t in her Lo&s;s; my Heart died, as it were, within me, and I &s;hould have been &s;uffocated on the Spot, had I not given in&s;tant Way to the Swell of my Sor|rows.</P>
<P>The Tempe&s;t of the Soul, Madam, like that of the Elements, can endure but for a Sea&s;on. The Pa&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Golding,</HI> on the Interment of every Joy and of every Hope that he could look for upon Earth, within a few Weeks &s;ub&s;ided, or rather &s;unk into a &s;olid but &s;ullen Peace, a Kind of Peace that &s;eemed to &s;ay there is nothing in this Univer&s;e that can di&s;turb me.</P>
<P><HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid he, one Evening, I have been thinking of the Vi&s;ion that I have had. Vi&s;ion, Sir, &s;aid I, has my <HI>Matty</HI> then ap|peared to you? Yes, he an&s;wered, &s;he was the principal Part of my Vi&s;ion for the&s;e twenty Years pa&s;t. The Vi&s;ion that I mean, my <HI>Harry,</HI> is the Dream of a very
<PB N="78" REF="77">long and laborious Life. Here have I, by the Toil of fifty Years Application, &s;crap|ed together and accumulated as much as, in the&s;e Times, would &s;et Kings at Con|tention, and be accounted a worthy Cau&s;e for &s;pilling the Blood of Thou&s;ands; and yet what are the&s;e Things to me, or of what Value in them&s;elves, more than the Stones and Rubbi&s;h that make our Pave|ment before the Door? I have been hunger|ing and thir&s;ting after the Goods of this World, I have acquired all that it could give me, and now my Soul, like a &s;ick Stomach, di&s;gorges the Whole. I then took one of his Hands, and pre&s;&s;ing it tenderly be|tween mine, O, my Father, I cried, my dear, dear Father, O, that I might be made Sons and Daughters and every Sort of Kindred to you! all that I am and have &s;hould gladly be &s;pent in bringing any Kind of Comfort to you, my Father!</P>
<P>In about a Fortnight after, as I enter'd his Apartment to bid him good Morrow, I ob&s;erved that his Countenance had much altered from what it was the Evening be|fore, that he looked deeply dejected and &s;eemed to breathe with difficulty.</P>
<P>Are not you well, Sir? No, &s;ays he, my Spirits are greatly oppre&s;&s;ed. I find that I mu&s;t leave you &s;hortly; I believe that I mu&s;t go &s;uddenly, but where to? that
<PB N="79" REF="78">is the Que&s;tion, the very terrible Que&s;tion; the only Que&s;tion of any Importance in Heaven or on Earth. Sure, Sir, &s;aid I, that can be no Que&s;tion to you, who&s;e whole Life has been a continued Cour&s;e of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, of daily Wor&s;hip to God, and good Will to all Men. If you have any Sins to account for, they mu&s;t be co|vered tenfold by the Multitude of your Charities.</P>
<P>Talk not, <HI>Harry,</HI> &s;aid he, of the filthy Rags of my own Righteou&s;ne&s;s. I am far from the Confidence of the boa&s;tful Phari|&s;ee; alas, I have not even that of the poor and humbled Publican, for I dare not look up to &s;ay, <HI>Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner!</HI> wherefore then do you &s;peak of having fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e toward God and toward Man? It is but lately, very lately that I &s;et out upon it, and I am cut &s;hort before I I have got within Sight of the Goal. Yes, <HI>Harry,</HI> I fear, I know, I feel that there is no Salvation for me.</P>
<P>You amaze me, Sir, &s;aid I, you terrify me to Death. If there is not Salvation for &s;uch as you, what a Depth of Perdition opens for the re&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P>I would you could convince me, he cried, I want to be comforted, I de&s;ire Comfort, any Kind of Con&s;olation. But
<PB N="80" REF="79">I feel my Condemnation within my&s;elf; moreover, I &s;ee every Text of the Go&s;pel of the Words of Life terribly mar&s;halled and &s;et in broad Array again&s;t me. What Text, Sir? &s;aid I; I am &s;ure I know of no Texts that bring Terror or Condemnation to the Ju&s;t. Ah, <HI>Harry,</HI> he replied, Ju&s;tice is of the Law and the Circumci&s;ion, and has nothing to do with the new Cove|nant or the new Man. For, what &s;ays the great Apo&s;tle? <HI>Circumci&s;ion availeth nothing, neither Uncircumci&s;ion, but a new Creature.</HI> For Chri&s;t him&s;elf had &s;aid, <HI>Except a Man be born again he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI> Again, the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>I de|light in the Law of God after the inward Man.</HI> And again, <HI>my little Children of whom I travel in Birth again, until Chri&s;t be formed in you.</HI> Now, if all the&s;e corre&s;ponding Expre&s;&s;ions of being <HI>born again,</HI> a <HI>new Creature,</HI> a <HI>new Man,</HI> an <HI>inward Man, Chri&s;t formed in us,</HI> &amp;c. are to be glo&s;&s;ed and explained away, as meaning little more than a State of moral Sentiments and mo|ral Behaviour, there can be nothing of real Import in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, hear what the Redeemer &s;aith. <HI>Except ye be converted and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Again, <HI>If any Man will come af|ter me, let him deny him&s;elf and take up his Cro&s;s and follow me.</HI> Again, <HI>Who&s;oever he
<PB N="81" REF="80">be of you that for&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things, I cried, are to be taken according to the apparent Sen&s;e and Import of the Letter, neither the Teachers of the Go&s;pel, nor tho&s;e who are taught, can be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Therefore, replied he, it is &s;aid that, <HI>Many be called but few cho&s;en.</HI> And again, <HI>Enter ye in at the Strait Gate, for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to De&s;truction, and many they be which go in there|at: Becau&s;e &s;trait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</HI> O, my <HI>Harry,</HI> my <HI>Harry,</HI> our Lives have been employed in &s;eeking and <HI>loving the World and the Things of the World,</HI> therefore <HI>the Love of the Father could not be in us.</HI> O, that I had never been born! O thou God, who&s;e Tribunal, at this Hour, is &s;et up &s;o tremendou&s;ly again&s;t me; at length I feel the Propriety of thy Precepts, in rejecting the World and all that is therein, for what can they yield, &s;ave a little Food and Raiment to bodily Corruption, or Incitements to that Pride which ca&s;t <HI>Lucifer</HI> into a Gulph that now opens before me without a Bottom.</P>
<P>As I trembled and had nothing to an|&s;wer, I propo&s;ed to bring &s;ome of our
<PB N="82" REF="81">Clergy to him. No, <HI>Harry,</HI> no, &s;ays he, I will have none of their wordy Comforts, I will not ca&s;t my Soul upon bladder'd Ex|pectations. Can they per&s;uade me that I am one of the Few who are cho&s;en; can they tell me wherein I have &s;triven to enter at the &s;trait Gate, where many &s;hall &s;eek to enter but &s;hall not be able?</P>
<P>Here he &s;unk into a a Fit of agonizing De&s;peration, &s;o that a cold Dew broke forth from all Parts of his Body, and fell, Drop after Drop, down his gha&s;tly and fearful Countenance. Never, Madam, never did I feel &s;uch a Kind of angui&s;hing Horror as I then felt, I was affrighted and all frozen to my inmo&s;t Soul. Ha&s;te, my dear Sir, exclaimed Lady <HI>Maitland,</HI> make ha&s;te through this Part of your Narration, I be|&s;eech you! I al&s;o feel for my&s;elf, I am ter|rified to the la&s;t Degree.</P>
<P>At length, continued Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> I re|collected my&s;elf a little. My Ma&s;ter, I cried, my Father, my deare&s;t Father, &s;ince you will not take Comfort in your own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, take Comfort in that of Him who was made Righteou&s;ne&s;s for you. Do you not now reject the World, do you not now deny your&s;elf? I do, I do, he &s;aid, I dete&s;t the one and the other. And do you not feel that you're wholly a Compound
<PB N="83" REF="82">of Sin and of Death? Ay, he cried, there is the Weight, there's the Mountain under which I &s;ink for ever. Come then to Chri&s;t, my Father, heavy laden as you are, and he will, que&s;tionle&s;s, embrace you and be Re&s;t to you, my Father! I would come, <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, but I dare not, I am not able. Strive, my Father; do but turn to him, and he will more than meet you. Cry out, with &s;inking Peter, <HI>Save, Lord, or I peri&s;h!</HI> and he will catch you with the Hand of his ever ready Salvation.</P>
<P>Here, his Countenance began to &s;ettle into an earne&s;t Compo&s;ure; and his Eyes were turned and fixed upward; while his old and enfeebled Body continued to labour under the Symptoms of near Di&s;&s;olution. At length he &s;tarted, and, &s;eizing my Hand with a dying Pre&s;&s;ure, there is Com|fort, <HI>Harry,</HI> there is Comfort! he cried, and expired.</P>
<P>I WAS now ca&s;t, once more, upon a &s;trange and friendle&s;s World. All the In|tere&s;ts of my Heart were buried with this Family; and I &s;eemed to my&s;elf, as with|out Kindred or Connections in the Mid&s;t of Mankind. Your dear Mama, indeed, &s;ometimes called to condole with me, and water my Lo&s;&s;es with her Tears; and in her, and you, my Cou&s;in, young as you
<PB N="84" REF="83">then were, was locked up and center'd the whole Stock that I had left of endearing Sen&s;ations.</P>
<P>As the Scenes of my former Happine&s;s &s;erved, daily and nightly, to render me more wretched by a &s;ad Recollection; I determined to quit my Hou&s;e and to take private Lodgings. For this Purpo&s;e I &s;ummoned Mr. <HI>Golding</HI>'s Dome&s;ties, and, as he had made no Will, I fir&s;t paid them their Wages, and then gave them &s;uch pretended Legacies as brought their Tears and their Ble&s;&s;ings in a Shower upon me.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had di&s;charged all, except the two favourite Servants of my Ma&s;ter and my <HI>Matty,</HI> I de&s;ired that <HI>John,</HI> our little old Man, &s;hould be &s;ent to me.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, as he enter'd, here is a Bill for five hundred Pounds, which our good old Ma&s;ter has left you, in Token of his Acknowledgment of your true and loving Services, and to help, with what you have &s;aved, to &s;often and make ea&s;y the Bed of Death in your old Age. Do you mean to part with me, Sir, &s;aid <HI>John,</HI> &s;eemingly thankle&s;s and unconcerned about the Gift which I had offer'd him; Indeed, <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, in my pre&s;ent State of Dejection, Attend|ance of any Kind would but be an Encum|brance to me. Then, Sir, you may keep
<PB N="85" REF="84">your Bounty to your&s;elf, for I &s;hall break my Heart before five and twenty Hours are over. Nay, <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, I am far from turning you from me; &s;tay with me as my Friend and welcome, but not as my Servant, and I &s;hall &s;ee the Comfort of old Times in always &s;eeing you about me. Thank you, thank you, Sir, he cried, I will not di&s;turb you with my Tears; but, I &s;hould die unble&s;s'd, I &s;hould die unble&s;s'd, if I died out of your Pre&s;ence, &s;o &s;aying, he ru&s;hed from me in a Fit of re&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I then &s;ent for my Wife's Maid, whom I formerly mentioned. She had ju&s;t heard of my di&s;charging the other Servants, and enter'd with a &s;ad and alarmed Countenance. Come near, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> I am going to part with you, &s;aid I, come to me and give me a farewel Ki&s;s. She approached with down|ca&s;t Looks, when, taking her in my Arms, I pre&s;s'd and ki&s;&s;ed her repeatedly, and &s;carce witheld my Tears. O, my Girl, my <HI>Matty</HI>'s precious Girl, I cried, I am not forgetful of your Love, your Honour, and your Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s toward us. Here, my <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> your darling Mi&s;tre&s;s pre&s;ents you with this Bill of a thou&s;and Pounds, and, if you choo&s;e, I will give you Ca&s;h for it within a Quarter of an Hour. This, however, does not di&s;charge me from my Regard and At|tention
<PB N="86" REF="85">to you; you are of a helple&s;s Sex, my <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> that is &s;ubject to many Impo&s;itions and Calamities; wherefore, when this Sum &s;hall fail you, come to me again, come to me as to your Friend, as to your Debtor, <HI>Su&s;y,</HI> and I will repeat my Remembrance, and repeat it again, as you may happen to have Occa&s;ion; for, while I have Sixpence left, the favourite Friend of my <HI>Matty</HI> &s;hall not want her Proportion.</P>
<P>Here, the grateful and amazed Creature threw her&s;elf on the Floor. She cried aloud, while the Family heard and echoed to her Lamentations. She cla&s;ped my Knees, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my Feet again and again. I could not di&s;engage my&s;elf, I could not force her from me. O, my Ma&s;ter, &s;he cried, my all that is left to me of my adored my Angel Mi&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t I then be torn from you, mu&s;t you live without the Ser|vice of the Hands and Heart of your <HI>Su&s;y?</HI> But, I under&s;tand your Regard and Care for me, my Ma&s;ter! it is a cruel and naugh|ty World, and mu&s;t be complied with.</P>
<P>Here I compelled her to ri&s;e, and ki&s;&s;ing her again, I turned ha&s;tily to the Chamber where my <HI>Matty</HI>'s Corps had been laid; and bolting the Door, and ca&s;ting my&s;elf on the Bed, I broke into Tears, and at length wept my&s;elf to &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
While I was preparing to leave the once loved Man&s;ion, I found, in Mr. <HI>Golding</HI>'s Cabinet, a Parchment that much &s;urprized me. On my Marriage, he had propo&s;ed to make a Settlement of his Fortune upon me, which, however, I ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to accept; whereupon, without my Privi|ty, he got this Deed perfected, which con|tained an ab&s;olute Conveyance to me of all his worldly Effects and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and this again renewed in me the tender and endear|ing Remembrance of each of tho&s;e Kind|ne&s;&s;es and Benefits which he had formerly conferred upon me.</P>
<P>I now found my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of near a Million of Money, which, however, in my Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind at the time, ap|peared no worthier than &s;o much Lumber in a wa&s;te Room. And I know not how it was that through the &s;ub&s;equent Cour&s;e of my Life, although I was by no Means of an oeconomical Turn, though I never &s;ued for a Debt, nor gave a Denial to the Wants of tho&s;e who a&s;ked, nor turned away from him who de&s;ired to borrow of me, yet uncoveted Wealth came pouring in upon me.</P>
<P>It was not without &s;ome Sighs and a plentiful Shower, that I departed from the Seat of all my pa&s;t Enjoyments. I took
<PB N="88" REF="87">Lodgings within a few Doors of your Father; and my little Hou&s;ehold con&s;i&s;ted of my favourite <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> my little old Man, two Footmen, and an elderly Woman who u&s;ed daily to dre&s;s a plain Di&s;h of Meat for us.</P>
<P>It was then, my faire&s;t Cou&s;in, that your opening Graces and early Attractions drew me daily to your Hou&s;e; my Heart was &s;oothed and my Griefs cheared by the Sweetne&s;s of your Prattle; and I was melted down and minted anew, as it were, by the unaffected Warmth and Innocence of your Care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As I had no Faith in Dreams, not even in that of my <HI>Matty,</HI> I thought it impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould ever marry again. I therefore re&s;olved, in my own Mind, to make you my Heir, and to endow you, in Marriage, with the be&s;t Part of my Fortune&mdash;But, you are a little pale, Madam, you look dejected and fatigued. If you plea&s;e, I will &s;u&s;pend my Narration for the pre&s;ent; and in the Morning, if you choo&s;e it, as early as you will, I &s;hall renew and proceed in my in&s;ignificant Hi&s;tory.&mdash;Here he pre&s;&s;ed her Hand to his Lips. She withdrew with a tearful Eye and a heaving Heart; and, the next Day, he re&s;umed his Narration, as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH you, my Cou&s;in, at that Time, were a great Con&s;olation to me, and a &s;weet Lightner of my Afflicti|ons; yet the Griefs of Heart which I had &s;uffered were not without their Effect; at length they fell on my Con&s;titution, and affected my Nerves or Spirits; I think our Doctors pretty much confound the One with the Other. Accordingly, I was ad|vi&s;ed to travel for Change of Air and Ex|erci&s;e; and I was preparing for my Jour|ney, when there happened in my Family the mo&s;t extraordinary In&s;tance of an ever watchful Providence that occurs to my Memory.</P>
<P>My little old Man <HI>John</HI> began to decline apace, and at length took to his Bed; and, having a tender Friend&s;hip for him, I went to &s;it be&s;ide him, and to comfort him the be&s;t I could. <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, are you afraid to die? No, Sir, not at all, not in the lea&s;t. I long to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with our loving Lord. Indeed, <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, I am inclined to think you have been a very good Liver. A Dog, Sir, a mere Dog, de&s;perately wicked, the vile&s;t of Sinners! I am a Murderer too, my Ma&s;ter, there's Blood upon my Head. Blood? &s;aid I, and
<PB N="90" REF="89">&s;tarted. Yes, Sir, replied <HI>John,</HI> but then the Blood that was &s;hed for me is &s;tronger and more precious than the Blood that was &s;hed by me. Blood, however, <HI>John,</HI> is a very terrible Thing; are you not afraid to appear before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t? By no Means, my dear Ma&s;ter, I have long &s;ince laid the Burden of my Sins be|fore him, for I had nothing el&s;e to bring to him, nothing el&s;e to offer him, and he has accepted them and me, and my Con|&s;cience is at Re&s;t in him. Then, <HI>John,</HI> there may yet be Room for Hope. There is A&s;&s;urance, my Ma&s;ter, for I have laid hold upon the Rock, and cannot be &s;haken.</P>
<P>But how do you intend to di&s;po&s;e of your worldly Sub&s;tance? All that I have, Sir, I got with you and my old Ma&s;ter, and, where I found it, even there I re&s;olve to leave it. Indeed, <HI>John,</HI> I will not finger a Penny of your Money. How much may it amount to? Eight Hundred and Thirty Seven Pounds, Sir, or thereabout. And have you no Relations of your own? Not one living that I know of. Then think of &s;ome one el&s;e, for no Part of it &s;hall lie on my Con&s;cience, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I have read &s;omewhere or other, Sir, of a great King who was advi&s;ed of God, in a Dream, to take the very fir&s;t Man, whom he &s;hould meet the next Morning,
<PB N="91" REF="90">to be his Partner in the Government. Now, if it plea&s;es you, my Ma&s;ter, I will follow the like Coun&s;el, and who&s;oever &s;hall be fir&s;t found before our Door, let that Per&s;on be the Owner and Inheritor of my Sub&s;tance! It &s;hall be even as you &s;ay, I will go and &s;ee whom God &s;hall be plea&s;|ed to &s;end to us.</P>
<P>Accordingly I went and opened our Door, when a Woman, who had nearly pa&s;&s;ed, turned about at the Noi&s;e, and perceiving me, came up and &s;aid, a little Charity, Sir, for the &s;ake of him who had not where to lay his Head!</P>
<P>I was &s;trongly affected by the Manner in which &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me, and, eyeing her attentively, I ob&s;erved that &s;he was clean though meanly apparelled; where|fore, to make a further Trial whether our Adventure was likely to prove pro&s;perous or not, I &s;lipt a Guinea into her Hand, and de&s;ired her to go about her Bu&s;ine&s;s. Ac|cordingly, &s;he courte&s;ied and went from me a few Steps, when, looking into her Hand, &s;he turned &s;uddenly back; Sir, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, here had like to have been a &s;ad Mi&s;take, you meant to give me a Shilling, and you have given me a whole Guinea; it was, &s;ays I, a very great Mi&s;take, indeed; but, be plea&s;ed to come in, and we will try to rectify our Errors.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91">
Here, I took her into the Chamber where <HI>John</HI> lay, and, having con&s;trained her to &s;it down, I put my Hand in my Pocket. Here, good Woman, &s;aid I, here are Ten Guineas for you, to make you &s;ome Amends for the Mi&s;take I was guilty of in giving you but One. The poor Creature could &s;carcely credit her Sen&s;es, but, rai&s;ing her Eyes in Ec&s;tacy, and dropping from the Chair upon her Knees, &s;he was proceeding to ble&s;s me; but I peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted on her retaking her Seat. Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid I, be plea&s;ed to &s;tay your Prayers for the pre&s;ent; what I want from you is the Story of your Life; tell me who and what you are, without &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any Circum&s;tances, or conceal|ing the Faults of which you have been guilty, and I will make you the Mi&s;tre&s;s of twenty Guineas, that &s;hall be added to what you have already received.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you frighten me; my Sto|ry is a very unhappy and a very fooli&s;h Story, and cannot be of the &s;malle&s;t Con|&s;equence to you. Sure, you are too much of the Gentleman to de&s;ire to en&s;nare me; and, indeed, I know not of any Thing whereby I may be en&s;nared. Wherefore, bountiful Sir, unto you, as unto Heaven, I will open my whole Soul, without &s;eek|ing
<PB N="93" REF="92">to know why you look into the Con|cerns of &s;uch a Worm as I am.</P>
<P>I was the Daughter of a Farmer in E&s;&s;ex, my Maiden Name was <HI>Elenor Damer.</HI> I was married, early in Life, to a Man who kept a Chandler's Shop in a little Lane that led to <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> his Name was <HI>Barnaby Tirrell. Barnaby Tirrell?</HI> ex|claimed <HI>John,</HI> are you very &s;ure that his Name was <HI>Barnaby Tirrell?</HI> Peace, <HI>John,</HI> I cried, whatever you may know of this Man, or of any other Matter, I command you not to interrupt the Woman till &s;he has fini&s;hed her Story.&mdash;She then con|tinued.</P>
<P>I had neither Brother nor Si&s;ter, Sir, but one Brother, a Twin Brother, and we loved one another, as though there was no Body el&s;e in the World to be loved.</P>
<P>About three Years before my Marriage, my Brother <HI>Tommy,</HI> then a &s;weet pretty Lad, took to a &s;eafaring Life, and went from me, I knew not where, upon a Voy|age that I was told was a very great Way off, and &s;o I cried, Day and Night, as many Tears after him as would have &s;erv|ed me to &s;wim in.</P>
<P>My Hu&s;band was very fond of me, and, when he u&s;ed to &s;ee me cry, while I &s;poke
<PB N="94" REF="93">of my <HI>Tommy,</HI> he would ki&s;s me and try to comfort me, and &s;ay, that he wi&s;hed for nothing more than his Return to <HI>Old England,</HI> that he might welcome him and love him as much as I did.</P>
<P>One Night, on the ninth Month of my Marriage, as I &s;at moping and alone, my Hu&s;band being abroad upon &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, I heard a knocking at the Door, which was opened by our little Servant Girl. And then, before you could &s;ay this, in leaped my Brother, and catched me fa&s;t in his dear Arms.</P>
<P>I gave a great Shout for Joy, you may be &s;ure; and pu&s;hing my <HI>Tommy</HI> from me, and pulling him to me again and again, we embraced, and cried, and ki&s;&s;ed; and embraced and ki&s;&s;ed again, as though we never could be tired.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Door being open, my cruel <HI>Barnaby</HI> entered, unperceived by either of us; and &s;eeing a &s;trange Man &s;o fond and familiar with me, he opened a long ha&s;ped Knife which he had in his Pocket, and ru&s;hing up, he gave my dar|ling Brother three Stabs in the Body, be|fore he could &s;peak a Word or turn about to defend him&s;elf. Then, ca&s;ting down the Knife, in a Minute he was out of the Hou&s;e, and I never &s;aw him more.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="94">
For a Time, I &s;tood like a Stone, and then giving a great Shriek, I fainted and fell on my Brother as he lay weltring in his Blood.</P>
<P>Our little <HI>Mary,</HI> in the while, being frighted almo&s;t to Death, ran about like a wild Thing, and alarmed the Street. Our Neighbours crowded in, and &s;ent for the next Surgeon. My Brother's Wounds were probed and dre&s;&s;ed, and he was laid in our &s;pare Bed.</P>
<P>Mean time, being forward with Child, I fell into &s;trong and untimely Labour, and after very grievous Travail, was deli|vered of a Boy, who was chri&s;tened and called <HI>James,</HI> after my dear and lately de|cea&s;ed Father.</P>
<P>No Pains of my own, however, kept me from enquiring after that dear and la|mented Brother who had been killed, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, for his Love to me. But his Youth and natural Strength carried him through all Dangers. In three Months he was up and about as well as ever. And, in le&s;s than three more, he &s;et out on ano|ther Voyage, from whence he never, ne|ver, O never returned.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="95">
Before he went abroad, my dear and &s;weet Fellow had left me a Note of Hand for the Receipt of his Wages. But, in five Years after, I heard that he was ca&s;t away, or killed by the Barbary People; and, though I went and went again, in the middle of my Wants, and in the the mid|dle of my Sorrows, to a&s;k and to petition for his Pay from the Admiralty, I never could get an An&s;wer of any Profit or any Comfort.</P>
<P>My little <HI>Jemmy,</HI> however, grew and throve and prated apace, and was my only Prop under all my Afflictions. My Hu&s;|band, indeed, had left me in pretty Cir|cum&s;tances, and, had he but &s;tayed with me, we &s;hould have pro&s;pered above our Fellows. But, what can a Woman do, &s;ingle, weak, and unprotected? I was im|po&s;ed upon by &s;ome; by others I was re|fu&s;ed Payment for the Goods that I had given, and at length I was reduced to Po|verty, and obliged to &s;hut up Shop.</P>
<P>Mean time I had &s;pared no Co&s;t on the bringing up of my <HI>Jemmy.</HI> I had given him School Learning, and he now was grown a very towardly and clever Boy. And, having taken to Me&s;&s;ages, my &s;weet Fellow, over Night, u&s;ed to bring to me whatever he had earned in the Day Time.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="96">
In the Lo&s;s of my Hu&s;band and Bro|ther; in the Lo&s;s of my <HI>Barnaby,</HI> and in the Lo&s;s of my <HI>Tommy,</HI> to be &s;ure I had Grief upon Grief; &s;o that my Health went from me, and next my Strength went from me, and I was not able to work at the wa&s;hing Bu&s;ine&s;s as before. But this didn't &s;ignify much, while my Child had his Health; for he had now got a Porter's Place in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and, young as he was, he willingly carried heavy Burdens to have the Plea&s;ure of bringing Home his hard Earnings to his Mammy. But, about &s;ix Weeks ago, may it plea&s;e your Ho|nour, my dear Boy fell ill of a Quartan Ague, as they call it, under which he, and his Mother's Heart &s;till continue to Labour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had ended her &s;hort Nar|rative, well, <HI>John,</HI> &s;aid I, methinks this Bu&s;ine&s;s will do; in my Opinion you have got a very worthy Inheritor of your For|tune; what &s;ay you to it, <HI>John?</HI> Fir&s;t, Sir, let me a&s;k her a Que&s;tion or two, if you plea&s;e. Hone&s;t Woman, draw your Chair a little nearer to me, I pray you. And now, tell me the Truth; did you ever Love your Hu&s;band? Yes, dearly, indeed, very dearly did I love him; for he had loved me very dearly, till that mi|&s;erable Night. But when, as I thought,
<PB N="98" REF="97">he had killed my Brother, I hated him as much as I had ever loved him before. But then again, when my <HI>Tommy</HI> had re|covered of his Wounds, I &s;ent far and near to enquire after him and find him out; and when I could learn no Tidings of him, I put it into all the printed Papers, that <HI>Thomas Damer</HI> was well recovered, and that <HI>Barnabas Tirrel,</HI> who had wounded him, might return, without Danger, to his Wife and Infant.</P>
<P>And he is returned, &s;houted <HI>John,</HI> he is returned, my <HI>Nelly;</HI> your barbarous and bloody Hu&s;band, who &s;tabbed your Brother, and left you and your Infant to fami&s;h, he is returned to you, my <HI>Nelly!</HI> and, in his Death, he &s;hall make you Amends for all the Sufferings which he brought upon you, during his Lifetime. But, my Ma&s;ter, my deare&s;t Ma&s;ter, &s;end immediately for my Child, my <HI>Jemmy,</HI> I be&s;eech you, that, bad as I am my&s;elf, I may give him a Father's Ble&s;&s;ing before I die!</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed and affected, Madam, beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, by Incidents that were at once &s;o wonderful and &s;o tender; and I directly &s;ent Servants and a Sedan-Chair for <HI>James,</HI> with Orders to have him care|fully and warmly wrapt up; for, what his
<PB N="99" REF="98">Mother told me of him had, already, gi|ven me a very &s;trong Prejudice in his Fa|vour.</P>
<P>Mean while, Mrs. <HI>Tirrel</HI> had &s;unk on her Knees by her Hu&s;band's Bed-&s;ide, and was plentifully pouring forth her Tears upon him; partly for Joy of having found him, and partly for Grief of having found him in that Condition.</P>
<P>O, my <HI>Nelly,</HI> my <HI>Nelly,</HI> cried <HI>Barnabas,</HI> had I known who the Per&s;on was who&s;e Blood I drew that terrible Night, I would &s;ooner have thru&s;t my Knife into my own Heart, than into any Part of the Body of that dear Brother of yours. But I was old and ugly, you know; and you were young and hand&s;ome; and Jealou&s;y is a mad Devil that rages in the Brea&s;t like Hell-fire; it never knew how to &s;pare, but tears and con&s;umes every thing that comes within its Reach.</P>
<P>At length <HI>James</HI> was brought to us, and, as we were in his Father's Apartment, a Chamber no way adorned, <HI>James</HI> entered without any Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons. He was a tall and comely Youth, but very pale and lean, and, as it was one of his well Days, he walked in without Help. He had barely been told that his Mother &s;ent
<PB N="100" REF="99">for him in a Hurry; &s;o that he enter'd with a vi&s;ible Alarm in his Countenance.</P>
<P>What is the Matter, my dear Mother? &s;ays he; alas, I am little able to help you at pre&s;ent. I hope nothing has happened that is &s;uddenly di&s;tre&s;sful. Nothing ami&s;s, my Child, more than that your dear Fa|ther, for whom I have &s;ought and been &s;ighing this many a Year, your Father lies dangerou&s;ly ill in this very Bed, my <HI>Jemmy.</HI> Am I then &s;o ble&s;s'd, cried the Boy, as to &s;ee and embrace a Father? O my Child, exclaim'd the old Man, and eagerly &s;tretched his Arms toward him, come to my Bo&s;om, thou only Offspring of my Bowels! I may now &s;ay, with ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Jacob,</HI> let me die, let me die, &s;ince I have &s;een thy Face, and thou art alive, my Son!</P>
<P>I would at any Time give a thou&s;and Pounds, my Cou&s;in, for a Tenth of the Enjoyment that I then had, in the Feelings which God poured into the Hearts of this little Family, on their &s;o very unexpected and marvellous a Meeting. It appeared to me, however, that young <HI>James</HI> even ex|ceeded his Parents in Love; and this gave me &s;uch a cordial Attachment to him, that from that Hour to this we have never been &s;undered. He never failed nor for&s;ook me; and, at this very Day, he is my re|&s;pected
<PB N="101" REF="100">Friend, and the Superintendant of my Family.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Barnabas,</HI> continued to linger, for about a Fortnight longer, and then departed quite happy, and without a Groan. During the &s;ame Space al&s;o, <HI>James</HI> was daily attended by my own Phy&s;ician, and was nearly ree&s;tabli&s;hed in his Health.</P>
<P>Being then intent on my Departure, I &s;ent for Mrs. <HI>Tirrel.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Tirrel,</HI> &s;ays I, I &s;hould be much inclined to take your <HI>James</HI> along with me, if I did not think you would grieve overmuch in his Ab|&s;ence. No, no, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I would to Heaven I were, my&s;elf, a young Man for your &s;ake. I de&s;ire no better either of him or for him, than that he &s;hould live and die faithfully and lovingly in your Service.</P>
<P>The next Day I went down the <HI>Thames</HI> in a Barge, partly for Recreation, and partly to &s;peak to the Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el in which I propo&s;ed to embark. As I drew near to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Wharf, I ob&s;erved a Wherry, crowded with Men whom &s;he was about to land at the Stairs; and, on Enquiry, I was informed that they were Slaves, whom our Con&s;ul at <HI>Algiers,</HI> by his Interce&s;&s;ion or Bounty, had ran&s;om|ed and &s;ent Home.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101">
Immediately, Compa&s;&s;ion ro&s;e powerful|ly in my Bo&s;om. Alas, &s;aid I, to my&s;elf, I &s;ee that I am not without Companions in Affliction. I, indeed, have now, neither Wife nor Children; nor Father nor Mo|ther; nor Brother, as I may &s;ay, nor Si&s;|ter; nor any Connection with the World in which I live. I am &s;hut out, as it were, from every Enjoyment upon Earth. Let me not however be envious; let me rather wi&s;h, and give, and di&s;pen&s;e Enjoyment to others; &s;ince, to give Joy to others is all the Joy, in this World, that is left to my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here, I ordered my People to land, and, coming up to the late Captives, My Friends, &s;aid I, you are welcome once more to <HI>Old England!</HI> I am fond of hearing Adven|tures; You, al&s;o, may have got your Ap|petites; and, if you will favour me with your Company, I will order a Dinner for us at yonder Tavern.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, Madam, that the Parties were &s;oon agreed. While a plen|tiful Dinner was providing, I met Alder|man <HI>Bicker,</HI> a City Magi&s;trate and an old Acquaintance of mine. Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid I, I in&s;i&s;t on your dining with me, to Day, at the <HI>Phaenix</HI> there. Perhaps your Com|panions will not appear to you of the mo&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="102">honourable Sort. They are, however, good Go&s;pel Gue&s;ts, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and con&s;i&s;t of the Halt, the Lame, the Maim'd, and the Beggar. In &s;hort, I have invited all yonder ragged Regiment, being about five and thirty Slaves from <HI>Barbary,</HI> to Dinner; and, after I have filled their Bellies, I in|tend to give them a hundred Pounds, <HI>per</HI> Man, to help them to begin the World again, and to keep them from being an Incumbrance on their Country.</P>
<P>Five and thirty hundred Pounds! ex|claimed Sir <HI>Thomas Bicker,</HI> five and thirty hundred times twenty Shillings of Sterling <HI>Engli&s;h!</HI> Its well for you, <HI>Harry Clinton,</HI> that old <HI>Golding</HI> was born before you; but nothing can hold you long at this Rate. To whom, again, do you propo&s;e to give this unmea&s;urable Bounty? to the Excre|ments of the Public, to Nui&s;ances and Of|fences again&s;t Society; to Wretches whom <HI>England</HI> has &s;pewed forth from a &s;ick and debauched Stomach. But, I &s;uppo&s;e you expect to purcha&s;e extraordinary Glories in Heaven, as the Reward of the&s;e very ex|traordinary Charities on Earth. No, in|deed, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid I, I &s;hall never crave nor look for any Thing, at the Hands of the Son of <HI>David,</HI> &s;ave only Mercy from him, and Ju&s;tification in him. However, my good Friend, if you will in|dulge me with your Company, you your|&s;elf
<PB N="104" REF="103">&s;hall be Judge of the Merit of the Parties, and I will wholly be guided by your Advice. Then, &s;ays he, do you &s;aunter here a few Minutes; while, in order to open the Hearts of your Gue&s;ts, I go and give them a Priming before Dinner.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> had executed his Purpo&s;e, he came forth, and, beckoning me to him, put his Mouth to my Ear. Don't be offended, &s;ays he, at &s;ome free Expre&s;&s;ions that I may happen to let loo&s;e, in order to encourage the&s;e Fellows to the like Liberty, and &s;hew you what Met|tal your Companions are made of.</P>
<P>Dinner was now &s;erved up on a Range of joined Tables, and Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> with an ea&s;y and chearful Familiarity, de&s;ired that they would &s;eat them&s;elves without Cere|mony. This many of them did with a Freedom not far from Impudence, while others drew back aba&s;hed, and begged Per|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;tand.</P>
<P>At the Head of the fir&s;t Sort was &s;eated a Fellow who&s;e fir&s;t Sight gave my Nerves a Thrill of Horror. His Countenance was of that Ca&s;t in which any one would place an implicit Confidence who wanted an A&s;|&s;ociate for any dark, traiterous, or bloody Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="104">
When the Cloth was removed, my Friend pu&s;hed the Bottles about very jovi|ally, and began to talk as an utter Latitu|dinarian in Morals, whereby he gained the Confidence of every Rogue in Company.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as mo&s;t of them were well warmed, for &s;ome drank but &s;paringly, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> took out his Pur&s;e, and, to&s;&s;ing a Guinea to each of them, Now, my brave Friends, &s;ays he, if you de&s;ire any more Favours, you mu&s;t tell me openly and ho|ne&s;tly the jolly U&s;e you intend to make of your Money to Night. Why, Ma&s;ter, an|&s;wered the ill looking Villain, as for me and my &s;ix Companions here, we have had a long Lent, and a Wench is the Word! That's gallantly &s;poken, cried out Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> here are three Guineas more, apiece, for you Seven. And now, my brave Friends, I &s;hall not be backward of another Bounty, if you will give me a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of your Adventures.</P>
<P>That is &s;oon done, my Ma&s;ter, an&s;wer|ed the Spoke&s;man. We &s;even were taken Pri&s;oners by an <HI>Algerine Cor&s;air,</HI> after an Engagement in which &s;even and twenty more of us lay in Blood upon Deck. We were &s;old to one <HI>Pedro Paolo,</HI> a <HI>Renegade,</HI> who, having been of all Religions in Chri&s;|tendom, had at length turned <HI>Turk.</HI> We
<PB N="106" REF="105">were u&s;ed very &s;everely, and, after &s;weat|ing all Day, were made to &s;weat Blood at Night with the Stripes which they gave us. However, we were hardy Dogs, and did not matter this very much; when one of their Prie&s;ts came privately to us, and promi&s;ed that, if we would for&s;ake <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and turn to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> he would en&s;ure us Liberty and Riches here, and Paradi&s;e hereafter. The&s;e, Sir, as you well know, were very tempting Things. But, as &s;oon as our Ma&s;ter under&s;tood that we had complied with the Terms; he hurried us, by Night, into one of his Gallies, where we were chained to the Oar, our Ears were lopped as you &s;ee, and, at every Meal of Bread and Water, we received ten La&s;hes. At length his Honour, the Am|ba&s;&s;ador, I forget how they call him, found us out and redeemed us, and &s;o you &s;ee us here.</P>
<P>Pray, my Friend, &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> are there any more in this Company whom you could recommend to me, as being of the &s;ame Gallantry of Spirit with your|&s;elf? Yes, &s;aid he, there are the two <HI>Johns,</HI> and the two <HI>Andrews</HI> yonder, who are none of the Saint <HI>Johns</HI> or Saint <HI>An|drews,</HI> I promi&s;e you. But yonder &s;its our Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> a canting Son of a Bitch; he wanted, truly, to preach to us, during our Voyage; and, in the la&s;t Storm, he
<PB N="107" REF="106">would have per&s;uaded us, for&s;ooth, to join with him in Prayer. Here then, cried Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> you two no Saint <HI>Johns,</HI> and you two no Saint <HI>Andrews,</HI> here are three Pieces a Man for you al&s;o; and that Mo|ney, I hope, Gentlemen, will be &s;ufficient to maintain you in Gaol, till we can hear a better Account of you. Ho, Drawer! are the People I &s;ent for in Waiting? They are, plea&s;e your Honour. De&s;ire them to &s;tep in.</P>
<P>Here entered a Serjeant at Mace with a great Po&s;&s;e of Con&s;tables. Serjeant, &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> take the&s;e &s;even and the&s;e four into your Cu&s;tody, and keep them in clo&s;e Durance till you hear further from me; I would rather open the Tower Cages, and let all the wild Bea&s;ts abroad through the Streets, than loo&s;e &s;uch Reprobates as the&s;e among Mankind.</P>
<P>At this In&s;tant, as a Con&s;table was lay|ing hold on our gallant Spoke&s;man, he &s;uddenly drew an In&s;trument that was half Knife and half Dagger, and leaping acro&s;s me, he caught Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> by the Throat, and rai&s;ing his Arm, would have plunged the Steel into his Bo&s;om; but, at the &s;ame Moment, I &s;eized his Hand, and throwing up his Heels, I ca&s;t him on his Back, and wrenched the Weapon from him.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="107">
As &s;oon as we were thus rid of eleven of our Gue&s;ts, a young Man came earne&s;t|ly up to us: Gentlemen, &s;ays he, till tho&s;e &s;even Hell-hounds were &s;ecured, I did not dare to open my Mouth. I know them all right well, and, had they known me, there is not one of them but would have thru&s;t his Knife into my Heart.</P>
<P>About eleven Years ago, I was taken as cabbin Boy, when they, with many more, were taken as Sailors on Board the good Ship <HI>Saint Catharine,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Tom&s;on,</HI> Ma&s;ter, bound for the <HI>We&s;t Indies.</HI> As &s;oon as we came along &s;ide the <HI>Cana|ries,</HI> this big Villain, <HI>Patrick Mc. Douel,</HI> prevailed on mo&s;t of the Crew to enter in|to a Con&s;piracy, whereupon they barba|rou&s;ly and &s;portingly murdered the Ma&s;ter, the Officers, and all who were not of their own Gang, except my&s;elf, being then about ten Years of Age. But they did not pro&s;|per long, for, the very next Morning, we were held in Cha&s;e, and then they wi&s;hed for the Help of tho&s;e Hands whom they had cut off. So, as <HI>Mc. Douel</HI> told you, after a very bloody Battle, we were board|ed and taken, and tho&s;e &s;even Confede|rates were &s;old to one Ma&s;ter; and, well as it happened for me, I was &s;old to ano|ther; and all this and more, I am ready to
<PB N="109" REF="108">witne&s;s in any Court, provided I am kept &s;afe from the Clutches of tho&s;e Devils.</P>
<P>Ay, exclaimed Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> the&s;e are your Charities, Mr. <HI>Clinton;</HI> and &s;uch the Objects of whom your Judgment has made Choice. Ah, my Friend, I replied, that Charity mu&s;t be very tardy, which waits to be a&s;&s;ured of the Merit of its Object. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf cured ten Lepers, while he knew that nine of them were unworthy of his Graciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the Entrance of the Con&s;tables, I had ca&s;t my Eye round the Room, and remarked that mo&s;t of our Me&s;s-mates &s;eemed much alarmed, and turned pale on the Caption of their late Comrades, which rendered their Characters, al&s;o, &s;omewhat &s;u&s;pected to me. Wherefore, le&s;t I &s;hould ca&s;t my Seed on a wholly barren Soil, I wi&s;hed to get &s;ome further Intelligence concerning them. Where, &s;aid I, is the Per&s;on whom they call Saint <HI>Thomas?</HI> I de&s;ire a few Words with him.</P>
<P>Here a Man approached, re&s;pectfully, from the farther End of the Table, to which, through Mode&s;ty, he had retreat|ed with his few Companions. Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid I, looking earne&s;tly at him, have I not &s;een your Face before? No, plea&s;e your Honour, I think that mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="110" REF="109">It is now upon eighteen Years &s;ince I &s;et a Foot in this Kingdom, and your Honour, mu&s;t then have been but as a Child. Do you know any Thing, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> of the&s;e People or their Affairs? Nothing of their Affairs, Sir, and little more of their Per&s;ons, than that they are, all, Men of very profane Lips; except the Lad who &s;poke to you la&s;t, and my five Me&s;s-mates yonder, the only People who, during our long and dangerous Voyage, would return Thanks to God for any of his Mercies, or pray him to avert his ju&s;t Judgments from them.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid I, we will proceed between Extremes. On the one Side, we will not mini&s;ter Fewel to the Lu&s;ts of the&s;e un|happy Creatures: neither will we leave them to peri&s;h; or tempt them, through Want, to Robbery, on the other Side. Here, Landlady, take this Bill. Give twenty Pounds to each of the&s;e &s;eventeen Fellows, and, if any of them, within a Month, &s;hall bring you a Certificate of his good Behaviour, give him twenty Pounds more. Now, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> I may hope, that I do not exceed your good Plea&s;ure. Not much, <HI>Harry,</HI> not much, in Time you may be tractable.</P>
<P>Here the poor Wretches looked amazed, and &s;carce crediting the Reality of the
<PB N="111" REF="110">Bounty that was ordered for them, they cried, thank your Honours, thank your Honours! and withdrew. One of them, however, &s;eemed to linger after the re&s;t, and, going out la&s;t, he returned again quickly, and threw him&s;elf at my Feet. I am a Reprobate, Sir, a mere Reprobate, he cried, and am not worthy of your Cha|rity. Does your Con&s;cience condemn you then, &s;aid I? It does, Sir, it does. Then I condemn you not; ri&s;e, ri&s;e, and give me your Hand, my Brother!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> now that I have kept you from ca&s;ting &s;o much Mo|ney on the Quick&s;ands, you can afford to be the more generous to the&s;e worthy Fel|lows. You will allow me then, &s;aid I, to order our Landlady to pay them a hundred Pounds apiece. With all my Heart, &s;ays he, and if you will be &s;o hone&s;t as to reim|bur&s;e me the &s;ixty or &s;eventy Pieces, which I threw away, for your U&s;e, upon the other Villains, I will add &s;omething to that, al&s;o, and divide it among them.</P>
<P>Then, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> if you will indulge me with your Company for an Hour or two longer, let us &s;end for an Undertaker to put our Friends here in decent Apparel; while we li&s;ten to what they &s;hall be plea&s;|ed to tell us of their Fortunes. Agreed,
<PB N="112" REF="111"><HI>Harry,</HI> agreed. So, let us re&s;ume our Seats, and have the other Bottle.</P>
<P>Mi&s;ter <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid I, pray what may be your Sirname? <HI>Damer,</HI> Sir. <HI>Damer, Damer!</HI> have you any Relations in this Kingdom? Alas, Sir, I fear not; my Fa|ther, <HI>Chri&s;topher Damer</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> died a little before I &s;et out on my la&s;t Voyage. And had you no Relation be&s;ide? O, Sir, that is it, which brought the Tears &s;o &s;ud|denly into my Eyes! I had a Si&s;ter, an only Si&s;ter, a Si&s;ter that I loved dearer than Health or Safety. But &mdash; I fear &mdash; I fear &mdash; here his Speech was &s;topped by his Emotion; while I was ready to leap up and catch him in my Arms; but I &s;uppre&s;s'd my Inclinations, for the pre&s;ent, that I might heighten the Surprize and Plea&s;ure which I fore&s;aw there would be at the Meeting of the Twins.</P>
<P>While all Materials were providing, from the &s;everal Ware Hou&s;es, for the Cloathing and Accommodation of our Gue&s;ts; they, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, gave us an Ab|&s;tract of their re&s;pective Lives and Hi&s;to|ries, wherein were many Incidents ex|tremely intere&s;ting and entertaining. Let us have them, let us have them, by all Means! cried Lady <HI>Maitland.</HI> My dear Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> were I to relate to you the &s;everal affecting Stories that
<PB N="113" REF="112">occurred to me, throughout my Travels, from Pri&s;ons, from the Depth of Dunge|ons; from Captives, and from Per&s;ons re|deemed from Captivity; from Wretches wrecked at Sea, or wrecked by Fortune; from tho&s;e who &s;urvived the Calamities of Warfare and Famine, I &s;hould never make an End.</P>
<P>But then, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, the poor Creature who felt &s;o &s;udden and affecting a Compunction; I have a Friend&s;hip for that Fellow, and I am deeply intere&s;ted in all the Concerns of my Friend, I mu&s;t tell you. Well, Madam, you &s;hall have his Story, then, as nearly as I can recollect at this Di&s;tance of Time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. The HISTORY of a REPROBATE.</HEAD>
<P>I Know not, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, who my Parents were. I was found, when an Infant, wrapped in Rags on a Cobler's Bulk, in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> The Wardens &s;ent me to the Pari&s;h Nur&s;ery for Foundlings; and, when I was capable of In&s;truction, they &s;ent me to the Charity-School.</P>
<P>When I had learned to read and write, I was bound, a Servant Apprentice, to Mr. <HI>Skinner,</HI> a neighbouring Attorney. My Mi&s;tre&s;s grew fond of me; &s;he was a very holy Woman; &s;he taught me my Prayers and Catechi&s;e, and made me read to her every Night, and repeat Chapters and P&s;alms, till I had nearly got Half the Bible by rote.</P>
<P>As my Ma&s;ter u&s;ed to &s;end me on many Errands and Me&s;&s;ages, and to entru&s;t me with little Matters of Money on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions, on finding me always punctual and hone&s;t to him, he began to love me almo&s;t as much as my good Mi&s;tre&s;s did.</P>
<P>But now came on my fir&s;t falling away from all Goodne&s;s. I was about twelve
<PB N="115" REF="114">Years old, when, in a cur&s;ed Hour, my Ma&s;ter &s;ent me to a di&s;tant Part of the Town, with a Bill to pay &s;ome Money, and to bring him back the Change. The Change amounted to about four Pounds in glittering Silver. It appeared a Mint of Money. I had never been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a Heap; and I &s;ighed, and &s;aid to my&s;elf, how ble&s;&s;ed mu&s;t they be who are become the rich Owners of &s;o much Money. Then, &s;ome one &s;eemed to whi&s;|per me that I was the Owner; and again &s;ome one &s;eemed to whi&s;per me that I was not the Owner. Then, I would go for|ward toward my Ma&s;ter; and again I would &s;top and go a&s;ide. Then, I would thru&s;t my Hand into my Pocket, and feel the Greatne&s;s of my Trea&s;ure, then turn to the Wall, and lay the Brightne&s;s of it before my Eyes. Then I would run a Piece off, as hurried away by the Force of the Temp|tation; and again, I would delay, and &s;top, and turn, and &s;trive to force my&s;elf home|ward. Till, what with doubting and de|laying, and &s;truggling off and on, and going backward and forward, I con&s;idered that, if I went home, I &s;hould now get nothing but Blame and Beating, and &s;o I took a head, and ran into the Country as fa&s;t as my Feet could carry me.</P>
<P>As I ran my&s;elf out of Breath, from time to time, I would look back and look
<PB N="116" REF="115">back, and run on and run on, in the Thought that my Ma&s;ter, or &s;ome one from him, was at my Heels. But, often &s;ince, I have reflected and was per&s;uaded in my Mind, that my kind Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of me, but rather enquired and &s;orrowed after me, as being murdered or kidnapped from them, and this al&s;o was, at times, a great Grief of Heart to me.</P>
<P>When I was quite tired and jaded, and Night came on, I turned up to a Carrier's Inn, where was written <HI>dry Lodgings</HI> over the Door. But, as I feared every thing, I had the Cunning to conceal my Trea&s;ure, and taking a Penny from my Pocket, I begged the Woman of the Hou&s;e, for that and Charity's Sake, to give me a little Bread and Milk, and &s;ome Hole to lie in.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my Supper, I was &s;hewn to a kind of Hovel that lay under the Stairs, where, throwing my&s;elf on &s;ome Straw, with a Piece of a Blanket over me, I fell fa&s;t as a Rock. Awakening, however, about Midnight, or &s;omewhat after, and &s;eeing all dark about me, and no Creature near Hand; I began to tremble greatly; and then I wi&s;hed to &s;ay my Prayers, but I did not dare to pray; and &s;o I lay &s;weating and trembling, and trembling and &s;weat|ing,
<PB N="117" REF="116">till the Dawning of the Day brought &s;ome Relief to my Spirits.</P>
<P>Having breakfa&s;ted at the Co&s;t of a &s;econd Penny, I &s;et out, though not with my former Speed; for, reflecting that I had not my Livery on, but a &s;mall Frock Coat, I was under the le&s;s Fear of being known. However, I pu&s;hed on as well as I was able, wanting &s;till to get as far from Danger as po&s;&s;ible. And, indeed, I hoped, by going on &s;till further and further, to get away from my own Fears and from my own Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>O Gentlemen, what Mi&s;ery did I not endure, at that Sea&s;on! the Tru&s;t I had in my Trea&s;ure began now to abate, the Dread of lo&s;ing it al&s;o brought new Trou|bles upon me; Peace was bani&s;hed from within me; and without, there was no Place whereto I might fly for Re&s;t.</P>
<P>On the fifth Morning of my Travels, having expended what Halfpence and &s;mall Silver I had; I took out Half a Crown, and offered it to the Man of the Hou&s;e, de&s;iring him to return what was over the Reckoning. As he took it, he gave me a Look that I thought went through me, and continuing to &s;tare me in the Face, he &s;hamed me &s;o, that I was con|&s;trained to turn a&s;ide. He gave me the
<PB N="118" REF="117">Change, however, and I &s;et forward on my Journey, all trembling and apprehending I knew not what.</P>
<P>I had not gone above a Mile, when, meeting a dirty Road, I turned over a Stile that led to a Path through the Fields. Here I walked on a Piece, when, turning, I &s;aw my Landlord making long Strides after me, whereupon my Heart beat, and my Knees grew &s;o weak under me that I &s;tood as &s;till as a Stone.</P>
<P>He came quickly up with me, and, &s;eiz|ing me by the Neck, he ca&s;t me on my Back. Ha! you young Rogue, &s;ays he, let us &s;ee what Money you have got. Then, diving into my Pockets, he pulled out the whole Stock in which I tru&s;ted for Happine&s;s. O, you little Dog of a Vil|lain, from whom have you &s;tollen all this Trea&s;ure? but, I mu&s;t go and return it to the right Owner. O, good Sir, good Sir, I roared out, will you not leave me a little? ever &s;o little, dear Sir, to keep me from &s;tarving? but he was deaf to my Cries and Prayers, and away he went.</P>
<P>Hope, the la&s;t Comfort of the Mi&s;era|ble, now for&s;ook me. I cur&s;ed, at my Heart, the Day in which I was born; and I lay a long Time, as one who had no U&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="118">for Limbs, nor any further Way to travel upon Earth. At length I broke into Shouts and a great Gu&s;h of Tears; and having got &s;ome Ea&s;e by venting my Sorrows, I ro&s;e, by a Kind of In&s;tinct, and went on I knew not whither.</P>
<P>Growing hungry after Noon, I would willingly have begged the Charity of Pa&s;|&s;engers, but this I did not dare to do, for fear they &s;hould a&s;k me whence I came, and who I was, and whereto I was going, Que&s;tions to which I could give no very hone&s;t An&s;wer. So, I bore my Hunger as well as I could, till coming over Night to a Hovel where a Farmer kept his Pigs, I made way for my&s;elf among them, and &s;lept in the Straw till Morning.</P>
<P>The Day following, as I pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly and half fami&s;hed through a &s;mall Village, my Eye catched at a Penny Loaf that lay on a little Shop Window which jutted into the Street. I looked here and there, and peered into the Shop, and was ju&s;t going to &s;eize the ready and tempting Spoil; when &s;ome|thing whi&s;pered, at my Heart, don't touch it for your Life, &s;tarve, &s;tarve, rather than offer to &s;teal any more, and &s;o I tore my|&s;elf away, and, running as fa&s;t as I could, for fear of turning back, I at la&s;t got clear off from the Reach of this Temptation.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">
When I had travelled &s;omething fur|ther, I got into an enclo&s;ed Country, where there were Hedges on every Side, with Plenty of Haws and Bramble Berries on every Bu&s;h. And here I filled my Belly with Berries to &s;erve me for Dinner; and I &s;tuffed my Pockets with Haws again&s;t I &s;hould want. Upon this I grew wonder|ful glad that I had not taken the Loaf; and Peace again began to come upon my Mind; and, about Night-fall, having reach|ed a Cop&s;e on one Side of the Road, I crept, like a Hare, under the Shelter of the Bu&s;hes; I then &s;upped upon my Haws, after which I kneeled down and half ven|tured at a Prayer to God; and gather|ing up in my Form, I &s;lept happily till Morning.</P>
<P>Having lived thus for &s;ome Days, I came into an open Country, where there was &s;carce any Path, nor any Haw or Ber|ry within many a Mile. I now began to grow &s;ick and faint with Hunger; and again my Sickne&s;s went off, and I became &s;o greedy and ravenous that I was ready to eat my own Fle&s;h from the Bones. Soon after, I &s;pied, at a Di&s;tance, a con|fu&s;ed Heap of &s;omething at the Root of a great Tree that grew in the open Fields. I made up to it in Expectation of I knew not what, and found an old Beggarman
<PB N="121" REF="120">fa&s;t a&s;leep in his patched Cloak, with a Bundle of &s;omewhat lying be&s;ide him.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly I opened his little Baggage, when, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible Tran&s;port, a large Luncheon of brown Bread, with &s;ome Half-pence, &s;truck my Eyes. I did not he&s;itate a Moment about &s;eizing the Bread, for I could no more with&s;tand the Cravings of my Appetite, at the time, than I could with&s;tand a Torrent ru&s;hing down a Hill. Having appea&s;ed my Stomach, I began to demur about what I &s;hould do with the Remainder of the Bread, and felt a Motion or two inclining me to leave it behind me. But, no, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, this is all the Bread that I have, or may ever have during Life, and I know not where to get a Bit in the whole World; be&s;ide, I do this Man no Harm in taking it away, &s;ince I leave him Money enough wherewith to buy more. So I put the Bread in my Pocket, and went on my Way, leaving behind me about four or five Pence in the Wrapper.</P>
<P>I had not gone far, however, before I &s;aid to my&s;elf again, this Man is a Beg|gar by Trade, and gets Halfpence from every Pa&s;&s;enger that goes the Road. But alas, no one living has any Pity upon me, and &s;o, to &s;tarve alive, or take the Money, is all the Que&s;tion. So &s;aying or &s;o think|ing,
<PB N="122" REF="121">I went back on Tiptoes, and &s;toop|ing and &s;eizing my Prey, I flew away like Lightening.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had got out of the Reach and Sight of the poor Man, the fir&s;t Motion I felt was the Joy of having &s;uch a Prize; but I had not gone far till this Joy was much abated, my Sighs began to heave, and my Tears to flow apace.</P>
<P>That Night, I took up my Lodging in a little wa&s;te Cabin that lay a Piece off the Road. But though, as I thought, I had Plenty of Bread, and Money enough about me, yet I found my&s;elf exceeding heavy, and I was not able to pray, as I did the foregoing Nights.</P>
<P>During all this time, I neither knew where I was, nor whereto I was going, nor any thing more of my Travels than that I came from <HI>London.</HI> When I had &s;pent to my la&s;t Penny, and was walking, &s;low and melancholy, on a By-path that led through &s;ome woody Lawns, I heard the Voice of Merriment, and, quickly after, perceived a Group of Gip&s;ies that came from behind &s;ome Trees.</P>
<P>As I &s;aw that I could not e&s;cape them, I gather'd Courage and went forward, when coming up, they &s;topped and eyed me
<PB N="123" REF="122">with much Attention, and made a Ring about me. Where are you going, my Child, &s;ays a Man with a broad Girdle and a very formidable Beard? Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I cannot tell. And where did you come from then? From <HI>London,</HI> Sir, &s;o plea&s;e you. From <HI>London,</HI> Child? why that is a very great Way off. And pray what made you leave <HI>London?</HI> To get away from my Ma&s;ter. But, I hope you did not come away empty, you brought &s;omething from him, didn't you? Some little Matter, good Sir, but I was robbed of it on the Way. Hereupon, this venera|ble Regent &s;miled, and turning to his Dependents, as far as I &s;ee, &s;aid he, this Chap will an&s;wer our Purpo&s;es to a Hair.</P>
<P>Here, one of the Females a&s;ked if I was hungry, and, on my An&s;wer in the affirmative, they all invited me with a jovial Air to Dinner. We then turned a Di&s;tance off from the Path wherein we had met, and gradually de&s;cended into one of the plea&s;ante&s;t Spots in the World. It was a Dell &s;urrounded with Hills, &s;ome of which were &s;lanting, &s;ome headlong and impending, and all cover'd or &s;potted with Groups of Trees, of different Heights, Sorts, and Colours; through which there de&s;cended a gurgling Rivulet, which, hav|ing rolled over Stones and Pebbles, grew
<PB N="124" REF="123">&s;ilent in a &s;mall Lake, that reflected the circling Objects from the Vale below.</P>
<P>Immediately, Nature's Carpet was co|vered with a large Cloth of fine dama&s;ked Linen. The Baggage was taken from the Shoulders of the Bearers; and, before I could take note of what they were about, there was &s;pread, as by Art magic, before my Eyes, the mo&s;t various and &s;umptuous Banquet I had ever beheld. Down, in|&s;tantly, &s;unk the Gue&s;ts; &s;ome &s;itting, like the <HI>Turks,</HI> cro&s;slegg'd; while others lolled, like the <HI>Romans,</HI> along &s;ide of each other.</P>
<P>As they had travelled far that Day, they all eat in Silence; and, in a &s;hort Space, the Burden of the Luggage-carriers was pretty much lightened. In the mean time, &s;ome aro&s;e, and unladed two A&s;&s;es of the Creels which they carried. The Cloth then was quickly emptied of the cold Fowls and baked Meats, with the Loins of Beef and Mutton; and leathern Jacks, that con|tained Plenty of the be&s;t Wines and other Liquors, were &s;et before us. The&s;e, again, were decanted into clean japanned Pitchers; and a japanned Cup, of equal Mea&s;ure, was given into every Hand.</P>
<P>Then began Mirth and Jollity to flow round with the Cups; never did I &s;ee
<PB N="125" REF="124">&s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o gleeful a Company. Joke and Banter, without Offence, were bandied from every Side; and Bur&s;ts of Laughter were echoed from the an&s;wering Hills.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was warmed and my Heart opened by what I drank, they all expre&s;&s;ed a Liking and Kindne&s;s for me, and re|que&s;ted that I would tell them my Story, without Di&s;gui&s;e. Accordingly, I made an ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of all the Matters related. But, in&s;tead of meeting tho&s;e Reproofs which I expected for my Wick|edne&s;s, they jointly began to ridicule my Scruples, and put to &s;hame the little Shame that I had of my evil Deeds.</P>
<P>My Child, &s;aid their ancient Governor, when you have been a &s;ufficient time with us, you will then learn what it is to be wi&s;e and to be happy. You will then know that Religion is nothing but Hypo|cri&s;y or Fa&s;hion. There are Thou&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands of Religions upon Earth, all contrary, and fighting the one again&s;t the other. People pretend to fear God, when it is the Fear of the Laws, alone, that is before their Eyes. God is not to be feared but to be loved, my Son, for he is a very gracious and a bountiful God: He gave the Heavens, in common, to the Birds of the Air. He gave the Seas and Rivers, al&s;o, in common to the Fi&s;hes.
<PB N="124" REF="125">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="125" REF="126">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="126" REF="127">And he gave this whole Earth in common to Mankind. But, great People and Peo|ple of Power have &s;eized it all to them&s;elves, and they have made to them&s;elves Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons and Properties by Fences and En|clo&s;ures; and they have again enclo&s;ed tho&s;e Enclo&s;ures by Laws of their own making, whereby the Poor are to be puni&s;h|ed when they attempt to reclaim any Part of the natural Rights with which God had gifted them. But, when the Poor, with|out Fear of the Laws, can gain any thing from the Rich and the Mighty who have robbed them of their Rights, they may &s;urely do it with a &s;afe and an hone&s;t Con|&s;cience. And now, know, my Child, that you are come among tho&s;e who, of all People can be&s;t defend you and make you happy. We are of that Sort of the Poor who are above the Rich and the Mighty, by being above the Laws; for they can frame no Laws which are of any more Force to us than the Web of a Spider.</P>
<P>So &s;poke this formidable Sage; and in|deed, Gentlemen, however &s;trange it may &s;eem, I &s;aw the latter Part of his A&s;&s;ertion fully verified by Practice. I continued among this very &s;ingular and wonderful People, near the Space of three Years; during which time they initiated me into all the Arts and My&s;teries of their manifold Iniquities. No Fetters could hold them;
<PB N="127" REF="128">no Pri&s;ons could contain them; no Bolts or Locks could &s;ecure the Trea&s;ures of the Wealthy from them. By the means of Spells or certain Odours, as it were by Enchantment, all Bea&s;ts became &s;ubject to them; the wilde&s;t Hor&s;e would &s;tand for them; the fierce&s;t Ma&s;tiffs did not dare to bay or growl at them; &s;o that all Bleach|greens, Yards, and Gardens were as open to their Inva&s;ion as the Highway. They a&s;&s;umed all Sorts of Shapes, and almo&s;t all Sorts of Sizes. They became vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, known or unknown at Plea&s;ure; for every different Dre&s;s they had a dif|ferent Countenance and Set of Features; &s;o that their daily Intimates could not know them, except by appointed Words or Tokens. And thus, without Violence or apparent Fraud, without Bu&s;tle, Indict|ment, or Accu&s;ation on any Side, they over-ruled the Government, and held, as it were, the Pur&s;es of the whole Nation in their Hands.</P>
<P>You will wonder, Gentlemen, by what Policy the&s;e People could maintain their Influence and Depredations, undetected, throughout the Kingdom. I will account for this Matter as clearly and as briefly as I can.</P>
<P>Though they never appeared, by Day, except &s;ingle or in &s;mall Parties of ten or
<PB N="128" REF="129">fifteen at mo&s;t, yet they kept their State entire, by quick and con&s;tant Intelligence. Be&s;ide, their Prince or principal Potentate, who was the Per&s;on that fir&s;t acco&s;ted me, they had a deputy Governor for every Shire; and, in every Pari&s;h, they had a Hou&s;e of common U&s;e and common Re&s;ort to the Fraternity. Here their Victuals were dre&s;&s;ed and their Provi&s;ions laid in; and here al&s;o were depo&s;ited the Spoils of the Public, which, when converted into Money, was locked in a &s;trong Box, one tenth for the u&s;e of the Society on any Emergence, and the other nine for the Be|nefit of the Spoilers, in Proportion to their re&s;pective Ranks and Merits.</P>
<P>Before we ro&s;e from our late mentioned Fe&s;tival, an ancient female Fortune-teller chucked me under the Chin and &s;aid, do you know, my Dear, where this &s;ame kind Landlord lives who robbed you of your Money? All I know, &s;aid I, is that he lives in a little Town at the Sign of a white Cro&s;s, and near to a great Windmill. What, cried one of the Men, my old Ho&s;t <HI>Jerry Gruff?</HI> he hates that any, except him|&s;elf, &s;hould pro&s;per by their Ingenuity. I owe that Fellow a Fling, cried another, for once attempting to circumvent me in his own Hou&s;e. Well, my Lad, &s;ays <HI>Geoffry,</HI> the old Governor, his Hou&s;e lies directly in the Way of our Circuit, and, for
<PB N="129" REF="130">your Encouragement, I promi&s;e you that he &s;hall refund you every Penny of the Money he took from you.</P>
<P>The Luggage being now up, we &s;et back on the Field Path by which I came; and, coming to a great Road, we divided into &s;mall Parties, who were appointed to meet at the Pari&s;h-hou&s;e, where we &s;upped merrily and &s;lept &s;oundly for that Night.</P>
<P>We &s;et out, the next Morning, by Dawn of Day, and entering &s;oon after upon a Common, we &s;aw a Parcel of Hor&s;es feed|ing without a Keeper. Immediately, three of the likelie&s;t were taken from the re&s;t. Out came Sci&s;&s;ars and other Implements, with Phials of colouring E&s;&s;ences, and to work went many Hands, when, in le&s;s than five Minutes, had the Owners come up, they could not have found a &s;ingle Mark of their own Property upon them. And, indeed, I have frequently known &s;ome of tho&s;e, my ingenious Brotherhood, &s;o very audacious as to &s;ell, in public Marker, the Cattle, which they had &s;tolen, to the very Per&s;ons from whom they were taken.</P>
<P>As the&s;e People were never unprovided of their Conveniences, the Hor&s;es were quickly bridled and di&s;patched, by &s;everal Emi&s;&s;aries, &s;everal Ways, to &s;ummon the
<PB N="130" REF="131">neighbouring Brotherhood, on the third Night, to meet near the white Cro&s;s with their appointed Apparatus.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the Evening of the Night required, we arrived on a little Hill that &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the Hou&s;e of my con&s;cientious Landlord; and, &s;oon after, we were joined by &s;everal Parties, from &s;everal Sides, amounting to about a hun|dred and twenty Per&s;ons, with Parcels of I knew not what upon A&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Packs were quickly opened, and from thence were produced black and flame coloured Gowns, Flambeaux, Hoofs, and Horns, and Vizards of horrid A&s;pect and terrific Dimen&s;ion. In a Hurry, we were all fitted with our re&s;pective Dre&s;&s;es and Characters. A large pa&s;teboard Cof|fin was covered with a white Sheet, and exalted upon the Shoulders of four fiery Devils; and, as Night began to fall dark and heavy upon us, a Light was &s;truck, the Flams were lighted, one was put into every right Hand; &s;peaking Trumpets, with other In&s;truments of heart-&s;inking Sounds, were put to many a Mouth, and we directly &s;et out on our diabolical Pro|ce&s;&s;ion. Some roared like Bulls, others houled and bayed like Dogs at a midnight Moon, while others yelled articulately in the catterwawling Gibberi&s;h; in &s;hort, the
<PB N="131" REF="132">Sounds made &s;uch a Complication of Hor|rors as no mortal Ears could abide, nor mortal Courage &s;upport.</P>
<P>Mean while the Town took the Alarm and began to be in Commotion. Old and young quitted their Hou&s;es, and hurried hither and thither through the Street. But, as we advanced, they made back|ward, and running, or climbing, or &s;cram|bling up Hill, they gathered all in a Body before the Windmill. In the Interim, we pu&s;hed forward, and entered the Inn, where neither Cat nor Dog, nor living Creature was left, &s;ave Goodman <HI>Gruff,</HI> who lay impotent, of the Gout, in an upper Cham|ber.</P>
<P>While mo&s;t of the Company &s;taid, rout|ing and &s;earching the Hou&s;e below, Sig|nior <HI>Geoffry</HI> led a few of us&punc; up Stairs. He repre&s;ented the Per&s;on of <HI>Lucifer,</HI> who&s;e Name was impre&s;&s;ed in flaming Characters on his Cap. On entering the Room where Landlord <HI>Gruff</HI> lay, Hark ye, <HI>Jerry,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Lucifer,</HI> you &s;neaking Thief, you mean petty-larceny Villain! how came you to rob a Child, the other Day, of the Money which he gained under my Influence and Encouragement? I have a mind, you Scoun|drel, to &s;trike you out of my Li&s;t of Inn|keepers. O, my good Lord <HI>Lucifer,</HI> cries <HI>Gruff,</HI> with a trembling Voice, in my Con|&s;cience,
<PB N="132" REF="133">now, I did not think that any kind of Robbery would be an Offence to your Honour. You lie, you Ra&s;cal, you lie, cries <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the Devil is a Gentle|man, he loves tho&s;e who rob the Great, who have robbed the Little; but he hates your low &s;pirited Scoundrels, who rob the Widow, and the Fatherle&s;s, and take from the little Ones the little that they have. Why, pray, my Lord <HI>Lucifer,</HI> are you a Chri&s;tian, cries <HI>Gruff?</HI> A better one, Ra&s;cal, than you or any of your Tribe; for, though I tremble, yet I believe. And I tell thee, <HI>Jerry,</HI> that I will make this Ge|neration to tremble; but, as I think, the Devil him&s;elf cannot bring them to be|lieve.</P>
<P>During this Confabulation, the whole Hou&s;e, Drawers and all, was gutted as clean as a Fowl for Supper. So, without entering into any other Habitation, away we marched as in our former tremendous Proce&s;&s;ion; till, coming to &s;ome &s;tanding Water, we halted, and, at a given Word, we altogether plunged our Torches in the Pool, and in&s;tant Night fell upon all the World.</P>
<P>Thus, from Day to Day, and Year to Year, while I continued with this People, I was witne&s;s to a Variety of Slights, De|ceits, Impo&s;tures, Metamorpho&s;es, and
<PB N="133" REF="134">Depredations, without any In&s;tance of their being brought to condign Puni&s;hment. One of them, however, within my Time, was detected, taken, impri&s;oned, brought to the Bar, tried, and brought in guilty; and yet found Means to evade Ju&s;tice by the mo&s;t marvellous Piece of Stratagem that ever was.</P>
<P>He was &s;pied in the Act of &s;tealing a bay Hor&s;e. Fre&s;h Suit was made. He was &s;eized and loaded with Irons in the Dungeon of the County Gaol. On the Day of Trial the Fact was proved by in|conte&s;table Witne&s;&s;es; and the Jury, with|out quitting the Box, pronounced the fa|tal Word, <HI>Guilty.</HI> Have you any thing to &s;ay, cried the Judge, why Sentence of Death &s;hould not be pronounced again&s;t you? I can truly affirm, exclaimed the Culprit, that I am as clear as the Light, of this Matter; that the Bea&s;t which I took, then was, and, to this Hour, is my own Property; and that there mu&s;t be &s;ome wonderful Mi&s;take in this Bu&s;ine&s;s; wherefore, my Lord, as I am upon Life and Death, I tru&s;t that your charitable In|dulgence will order this &s;ame Hor&s;e to be brought into Court. The Hor&s;e accord|ingly was brought, and the Culprit continu|ed, Now, my Lord, be plea&s;ed to order the Witne&s;&s;es to &s;ay whether this be the &s;ame Hor&s;e that I &s;tole or not? The &s;ame, the
<PB N="134" REF="135">&s;ame, cried the Witne&s;&s;es, by Virtue of our Oaths. Be &s;o good then, my Lord, to a&s;k them of what Age this Hor&s;e was, at the Time that I &s;tole him? By Virtue of the &s;ame Oath, four Years old ri&s;ing five. Now, my Lord, if you will continue your gracious Indulgence, be plea&s;ed to order his Mouth to be examined by &s;ome People &s;killed in &s;uch Matters. This al&s;o was done by two or three Jockeys, of acknow|ledged Judgment, who in&s;tantly cried out, why, my Lord, this Hor&s;e is quite pa&s;&s;ed Mark of Mouth.</P>
<P>Hereupon, every Per&s;on that was pre&s;ent looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and Silence was in Court for &s;ome Minutes; till the Culprit re&s;umed. There is but one Reque&s;t more with which I &s;hall trouble your Lord&s;hip; it is, that you would be plea&s;ed to &s;end and examine whether this &s;ame Hor&s;e be a Hor&s;e or a Mare. This la&s;tly was done, when the Examiners cried out, a Mare, my Lord, a Mare, without any Que&s;tion!</P>
<P>Here, the Surprize and Amazement of the Court was redoubled. The Jury look|ed down aba&s;hed; the Witne&s;&s;es &s;lunk away in utter Shame and Confu&s;ion; and his Lord&s;hip in&s;tantly ordered that the Pri|&s;oner &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without Fees, and that the Mare &s;hould be re&s;tored to him as his proper Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
Now, the whole My&s;tery of the Affair was merely this, that &s;ome of the Frater|nity, the very Night before the Trial, had picked the Lock of the Stable, and, in the Place of the Hor&s;e, had &s;ub&s;tituted this Mare, whom they found or formed to &s;o perfect a Re&s;emblance of him, that no Eye could di&s;cern the &s;malle&s;t Di&s;|tinction.</P>
<P>During my Sojourn with the&s;e Wretches, may it plea&s;e your Honours, I found by dear Experience, that, between the Birth and the Grave, there are but two Sorts of Happine&s;s, of which Man is capable. The one is, that of a <HI>Con&s;cience void of giving Offence;</HI> the other is, that of a <HI>Con&s;cience that cannot be offended.</HI> I was therefore per|petually mi&s;erable, becau&s;e neither the one nor the other was my State; for, on the one Hand, I was con&s;cious that I gave daily Offence to God and Man; and, on the other Hand, my Con&s;cience was daily offended thereby. I was merry, indeed, though not happy, when in Company, but ever dejected when left alone; &s;o that du|ring my three Years Incorporation with this Fraternity, I never once lifted my Heart in any Appeal to God, nor ventured to petition for any Kind of Favour from him.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
Though the&s;e Reprobates, as I have in|timated, continued to perpetrate, and to glory, with a merry and &s;atisfied Con&s;ci|ence, in their daily Iniquities; yet, hither|to, they had not proceeded to Blood.</P>
<P>On the Night, wherein I left them, we we were overtaken, and cut &s;hort of our intended Re&s;t, by a &s;udden and violent Tempe&s;t of Wind and Hail, whereupon we took Shelter in a wa&s;te Barn that had belonged to the late Farmer of the Place.</P>
<P>When we had &s;truck on our Tinder and lighted a Candle, we &s;et together what Straw and Combu&s;tibles we could find in the Hou&s;e, and had ju&s;t kindled a Fire, when one of the Company came and whi&s;|pered that there was a Man a&s;leep in the far Corner. Hereupon, they took the Candle, and, with &s;oftly and cautious Steps, found a Pedlar &s;tretched along, with his Head on a Wi&s;p of Straw, and his Box clo&s;e be&s;ide him. They immediately lifted the Box, and brought it away, in Silence, to the Place where I was &s;itting. On opening it, with as little Noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, they found therein a large Quantity of Silks, Linens, and Laces, with a rich Va|riety of hard Wares; and, at the Bottom, a little padlocked Che&s;t, full of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pieces of Gold; in all Likelihood
<PB N="137" REF="138">the whole Amount of the Labours of his Life.</P>
<P>This was a Prize not to be thrown down the Stream. Immediately all was in a kind of underbreathing Bu&s;tle, and whi&s;per|ing Commotion. The great Que&s;tion was, how to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of &s;uch a Prey, with Safety to their Per&s;ons. It was ob|jected that the Man might waken; they were unluckily &s;een coming that way, and, it may be, entering into that Hou&s;e; the Country might be alarmed and ri&s;e upon them; they might be overtaken; they might be &s;eized in the very Fact.</P>
<P>At length, a bold Villain propo&s;ed di|rectly to cut his Throat, and that, then, there could be no witne&s;s to te&s;tify again&s;t them; but to this it was again objected, that the Blood it&s;elf would be the fear|fulle&s;t and &s;ure&s;t of all Witne&s;&s;es. Where|upon, another propo&s;ed to &s;uffocate or &s;trangle him and bury his Corps on the Spot; to which Scheme, though many were &s;ilent, yet no one expre&s;sly excepted.</P>
<P>During this deadly Con&s;ultation, not|with&s;tanding my long Cour&s;e of evil Habit, and evil Example, my Blood curdled throughout my Body, and Fear, Horror, and Dete&s;tation aro&s;e in my Bo&s;om. But, when they went, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to put the
<PB N="138" REF="139">deed of Death into in&s;tant Execution, I crouched and &s;hrunk inward; and creep|ing out at the Door, the Dread of be|ing, al&s;o, &s;eized and murdered, gave me Strength to get on my Feet, and, feeling along by the Wall, I got away from the Hou&s;e, and made off I neither knew nor cared where or whereto.</P>
<P>The Tempe&s;t &s;till continued; the driv|ing of the Clouds added to the natural Horrors of Night; I could &s;carcely di&s;cern that I had a Road under my Foot. But, though I could not &s;ee my Pur&s;uers, I yet feared that their Eyes were better than mine; and I &s;till turned and li&s;tened, to try if the Foot of the Murderer was be|hind me.</P>
<P>Having travelled all Night as fa&s;t and far as I could from the Scene of my Terrors; on the Ri&s;ing of the Day I &s;aw a large Town before me, and, for the fir&s;t time of three Years, I lifted up my Eyes, and inwardly ble&s;&s;ed God for his Mercy in my E&s;cape from &s;o great a Wickedne&s;s. Thereupon I felt a Plea&s;ure that I had ne|ver felt before; and I &s;aid in my Heart, if you will once more be my God, I will be your true Servant, and will never of|fend or tran&s;gre&s;s any more.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140">
I then walked on lei&s;urely, and my Fa|tigue went from me, and I &s;eemed quite light&s;ome to my&s;elf. On entering the Suburbs I met a Gentleman taking his Morning's Walk out of Town. I &s;topped and looked him wi&s;tfully in the Face, whereupon he al&s;o &s;topped and eyed me with much Attention. Who are you, my pretty Lad? &s;ays he. An unhappy Stran|ger, Sir, who wants a Service, or any Means of earning a little hone&s;t Bread. And pray what Service can you do? Not much, Sir, I fear, but my Good-will &s;hall &s;trive hard to make up my Lack of Ability. Then, cried he, you &s;hall be my Servant. All the Servants I ever had promi&s;ed every thing, but did little; I will now try what may be done by one who promi&s;es nothing. What is your Name, my Boy? <HI>David Doubtful,</HI> Sir; for that was my true Name, though I had gone by &s;everal others. And what Wages mu&s;t I give you, <HI>David?</HI> Ju&s;t as much, Sir, or as little as you &s;hall plea&s;e to think I de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Here he took me to a hand&s;ome Hou&s;e, where he kept a Mercer's Shop in <HI>Plymouth.</HI> His Name was <HI>Felton;</HI> he had been a Wi|dower, of &s;ome Years; and had an only Son who was then at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> School in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="141">
My Ma&s;ter, at fir&s;t, &s;et me to the mo&s;t &s;ervile and vile Offices, &s;uch as cleaning his and the Servants Shoes; &s;weeping the Street before his Door, and carrying out the Dirt of the Hou&s;e; but all this I did with Willingne&s;s, and even with Plea&s;ure, as &s;ome little Matter of Penance for my long Cour&s;e of evil Deeds.</P>
<P>On my &s;eparating from my Brethren in Iniquity, as I have told you, I was the Proprietor of one hundred and &s;eventy odd Pounds, which was locked up in the Pa|ri&s;h Che&s;t, being my allotted Dividend of the Fruits of our common Knavery, for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Years; but, in my pre&s;ent Turn of Mind, I would no more have ac|cepted any Part thereof, than I would have taken a Bar of red hot Iron into my Hand. I had al&s;o, in my Pocket a few Crowns with &s;ome &s;maller Silver, but the&s;e I &s;ecretly di&s;tributed among the Poor, that no Part, as it were, of <HI>Achan</HI>'s accur&s;ed Thing might remain about me.</P>
<P>In about three Weeks, my Ma&s;ter again changed the whole Manner of my Service, and &s;et me to bru&s;h his Clothes, dre&s;s his Wigs, whet the Knives, lay the Cloth, and attend at Table; but the&s;e were Mat|ters in which I was quite expert, as I had
<PB N="141" REF="142">not yet forgotten my Employment with my fir&s;t Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Time after, Mr. <HI>Felton</HI> a&s;ked me if I could read; a little in the Bible, Sir, &s;aid I. And, can you write too, <HI>David?</HI> If you plea&s;e I will try, Sir. Why, <HI>David!</HI> this beats the Hand of my Clerk; where in the World did you come by all this Learning? From a very good Ma&s;ter to a very bad Servant; but, pray Sir, do not enquire the Particulars of my Naugh|tine&s;s; for, indeed, you could not de&s;ire a &s;everer Monitor than my own Con&s;cience is to me. Well, my Child, &s;aid the good Man, I will not put you to Pain; and &s;o, giving me a Squeeze by the Hand, he went out with a gli&s;tening Eye.</P>
<P>From this Time my Ma&s;ter &s;hewed an uncommon Re&s;pect and Attention to me. He di&s;charged me from all the menial Offices of his Hou&s;ehold; he gave me his Burdens of Silks, and other Wares to carry to his &s;everal Cu&s;tomers; and he de&s;ired me to take particular Notice of the Nature and Values of what I carried.</P>
<P>On this Encouragement I became va&s;tly more apprehen&s;ive and a&s;&s;iduous than he looked for. I attended the Shop clo&s;ely, and took Notice and private Notes of all that was e&s;timated or tran&s;acted therein.
<PB N="142" REF="143">My Ma&s;ter looked quite amazed, on a&s;k|ing me &s;ome Que&s;tions with re&s;pect to his Affairs. His elde&s;t Prentice, &s;oon after, &s;et up for him&s;elf. He then placed me behind the Counter, over his younger Ap|prentice, and in joint Authority with his Journeyman. And, &s;oon after, he gave me the Key of his Till, and the Tru&s;t of all his. Trea&s;ure. I now dined with him at the &s;ame Table, and con&s;ulted and con|ver&s;ed with him as his Friend and Compa|nion. He gave me frequent Pocketmoney, which, he told me, he would not charge to the Account of my Wages. I walked with him every Evening, went to Church with him every Sunday, and read to him, in the Bible, every Night. I was now wholly reconciled to my God, and felt him in my Soul as a Friend and Benefac|tor. Plea&s;ure play'd about my Heart, Peace lay under my Pillow; and my Happine&s;s &s;eemed as a Ship that, after a long and de&s;perate Voyage, had anchored in a calm and &s;ecure Haven.</P>
<P>I had now been &s;omething upward of a Year in the Service of Mr. <HI>Felton,</HI> when, one Day, I heard a bu&s;tling Noi&s;e in the Street, and &s;aw People running hither and thither acro&s;s the Window. I &s;tepped to the Door, and, looking to the Left, &s;aw a great Crowd about a Cart, wherein were five Criminals going to Execution. I &s;taid
<PB N="143" REF="144">till they came ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to me, when, to my utter A&s;toni&s;hment and Terror, I I &s;aw five of my old Acquaintance, and, in the Front of them, the bloody Villain who had propo&s;ed cutting the Throat of the unfortunate Pedlar. In&s;tantly I turned all pale as my Shirt, and, dreading that they would know and claim Acquaintance with me, I &s;hrunk in, and, running back|ward, threw my&s;elf half fainting into a Chair.</P>
<P>I now reflected that it was happy for me that no one was in the Shop to take Note of my Confu&s;ion; and endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume &s;ome Courage, on the Enterance of our Journeyman, I put on the mo&s;t un|concerned Appearance that I could.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Felton</HI> happened to dine abroad that Day, and did not return till the Cloth was laid for Supper. He took his Chair at Table, and de&s;ired me to &s;it be&s;ide him. <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, is it not wonderful that People &s;hould continue &s;o incredulous, notwith&s;tanding the frequent and daily Proofs of an all-&s;eeing and an all-detecting Providence? If a Sparrow falls not to the Ground without the Notice of our God, how much more will he take Account of the Life of him whom he formed in his own Image. The Villain tru&s;ts to hide his Villany, and dares to affirm (with the
<PB N="144" REF="145">fir&s;t Murderer) in the Face of God and of Man, <HI>I know not where is my Brother.</HI> But Blood has a Voice, a crying Voice, <HI>David;</HI> it cries aloud to Heaven, from the very Bowels of the Earth. No Depth can cover it, no Darkne&s;s can conceal it, for the Light that &s;hineth in Darkne&s;s will bring it forth to the Day.</P>
<P>About twelve Months ago, a Pedlar, or itinerant Merchant, was murdered in a wa&s;te Hou&s;e, called <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Barn. The Murderers were of the People whom they call Gip&s;ies, the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and eva&s;ive of all Sorts of Reprobates, &s;o that the Fact lay a long Time in Silence. This Pedlar, as it &s;eems, had an only Brother, to whom the Rever&s;ion of his Sub&s;tance belonged; and this Brother, not &s;eeing or hearing from him of a long Time, went through|out the whole Country, and through many Parts of the Kingdom, enquiring after him. At length he arrived, over Night, at an Inn &s;ome Miles from hence, where he found, in the Kitchen, &s;even Men jovially &s;eated over a Bowl of Punch; he quickly accepted their Invitation, and having &s;pent the Time plea&s;antly, and the Hou&s;e being throng, he and one of the Company were &s;hewn to the &s;ame Bed.</P>
<P>About Midnight, his Companion began to moan mo&s;t piteou&s;ly, when, jogging,
<PB N="145" REF="146">and a&s;king him why he groaned? O, <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Barn, he cried, <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Barn, <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Barn! Again, lying &s;till awhile, he &s;tarted, and cried, you cannot &s;ay it, you cannot &s;ay that my Hand was in the Murder. Again he would mutter, with a half &s;mother'd Voice, &s;ee, &s;ee, how he &s;trug|gles, &s;ee how he kicks; put, put him out of Pain, O, put him out of Pain!</P>
<P>Hereupon, the Brother ro&s;e and dre&s;&s;ed as quietly as po&s;&s;ible, and, making way to the next Magi&s;trate, he returned and &s;eiz|ed and carried off his Bedfellow before any of his Comrades were apprized of the Matter.</P>
<P>What have you done, you Villain, &s;aid the Magi&s;trate without Preface, what have you done with the Body of the Pedlar whom you murdered in <HI>Fielding</HI>'s Barn? On this Que&s;tion, the Wretch, thinking that all was detected, in&s;tantly fell on his Knees. I had neither Hand nor Heart in the Murder, Sir, he cried; and, if you will get me a Pardon, I will faithfully tell you the whole Affair. On his Confe&s;&s;ion, the five principal Rogues were arre&s;ted be|fore they were out of Bed. And, on his Evidence, and that of their &s;eventh Com|panion, they were &s;entenced, and this Day executed, and are to be gibbeted in the Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
During this Narration, I could not re|frain from expre&s;&s;ing, by my Countenance and Ge&s;ture, the &s;trong Compunction I felt on recollecting my long A&s;&s;ociation with tho&s;e Reprobates; but my good Ma&s;|ter, as I &s;uppo&s;e, a&s;cribed my Emotions merely to the Dete&s;tation which I had of their Deeds.</P>
<P>I had been clo&s;e upon two Years in the Service of Mr. <HI>Felton,</HI> and he had lately agreed with me at 25<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly, whereof he paid me the la&s;t Year's Wages in Hand; when, one Evening, as I &s;tood be|hind the Counter, a young Woman came in and de&s;ired to &s;ee &s;uch and &s;uch Goods. While &s;he was cheapening on the one Hand, and I &s;etting forth the extraordi|nary Value on the other, &s;everal intelli|gent Glances were exchanged between us. Whenever her Eyes met mine, &s;he in|&s;tantly ca&s;t them down with a blu&s;hing Mode&s;ty; and, yet, whenever I looked at her, I &s;aw that her Eyes had been fixed upon me. At length, having bought &s;ome little Matters, &s;he made me a ba&s;hful Courte&s;y, and going out at the Door, &s;he turned upon me with a &s;ignificant Glance and departed.</P>
<P>All that Night I felt my&s;elf as I had never felt before; I turned, and turned
<PB N="147" REF="148">again from the Image of this Girl, and yet &s;he &s;eemed to &s;tand before me, and to look, and to look upon me, as &s;he had done the Day before.</P>
<P>For five tedious Days &s;he witheld her|&s;elf from my Sight, and I feared that I &s;hould never behold her any more. At length &s;he came, and I &s;trove in vain to conceal my Joy on her Appearance. After cheapening and paying for &s;ome little Mat|ters, &s;he ca&s;t her Eye on a Piece of Silk, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he fancied greatly, but feared that her Pocket would not reach &s;o far. O Mi&s;s, &s;aid I, we &s;hall not quarrel for &s;uch a Matter, provided I know where to call for the Money. On <HI>Sarah Simper,</HI> Sir, &s;aid &s;he, at &s;uch a Sign in &s;uch a Row.</P>
<P>As I had three or four &s;pare Hours from Bu&s;ine&s;s every Evening, I gladly laid hold of the Occa&s;ion I had gotten for &s;pending that Time in Vi&s;its to my Belov|ed. I went, indeed, without forming any Purpo&s;e or Intention, &s;ave the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her. Her Fondne&s;s &s;eemed, at lea&s;t, to equal my own; and, tho' we proceeded, at Times, to Toying, and Dal|lying, yet, for three Weeks we kept with|in warrantable Limits. But this was not always the Ca&s;e. Our fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was &s;ucceeded, on her Part, by Tears and
<PB N="148" REF="149">Reproaches, and, on mine, by a Depth of Sorrow and Remor&s;e.</P>
<P>As this was my fir&s;t Fault, with re&s;pect to Woman, my Con&s;cience was yet un|&s;teeled. I &s;pent the Night in Sighs and Tears of Contrition; and I repeated a thou|&s;and Promi&s;es and Vows to my God that I never would be guilty of the like again.</P>
<P>For five entire Days I kept from going to her. At length I con&s;idered, that, as I had injured her, I ought to make her &s;uch Recompence, as was in my Power. I put about twelve Pounds into my Pocket, be|ing all that I had left of my la&s;t Year's Sa|lary, and went and told her that I was come to take my leave of her; then, pour|ing the Money into her I ap, I promi&s;ed to give her what I &s;hould earn from Time to Time, and to marry her whenever I &s;hould be enabled to maintain a Family. Here we both fell into Tears, and, from Tears we proceeded to Care&s;&s;es, and &s;o forth, till, at la&s;t, we became as guilty as we had been before.</P>
<P>In like Manner, for the &s;ix en&s;uing Weeks, I kept on in a Cour&s;e of repenting and &s;inning, and of &s;inning, and again re|penting. Every Night, I formed Re&s;olu|tions which I imagined would be &s;tronger than any I had made before, but, what|ever
<PB N="149" REF="150">Force I put on my&s;elf, whatever Strength I exerted, I never was able to per&s;evere for three Days together. When I felt my&s;elf drawn to her, as by &s;ome ir|re&s;i&s;table Chordage, I vowed, and flattered my&s;elf, on the Way, that I would return without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing; but when I came to her, I found it quite as impo&s;&s;ible to keep from &s;inning with her as it was to keep from her. Thus, by frail, and fal&s;ified Vows, I daily continued to add to the Heap of my Guilt; till, at length, I be|came hopele&s;s of any Ability to re&s;i&s;t Temptation, and &s;inned on with my Eyes open, and yet with le&s;s Remor&s;e than be|fore.</P>
<P>As I was &s;itting with her one Evening, a Bailiff enter'd &s;uddenly, and laid an Acti|on upon her for fifteen Pounds, which, he &s;aid, &s;he promi&s;ed to pay for her Mother, in her la&s;t Illne&s;s. Whether the Debt was feigned, and the Caption preconcerted be|tween them, I know not; but I, after|ward, recollected that &s;he did not &s;eem to be &s;o alarmed, as one would have expect|ed on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. On the other Hand, my Soul was filled with bitter and di&s;tracting Thoughts. I could not think of &s;uffering my Love to be confined, among Fellows, in a common Pri&s;on; and yet, how to come by the Money I knew not.</P>
<P>offered the Man my Note payable when
<PB N="150" REF="151">my Salary &s;hould be due; but he refu&s;ed to depart without in&s;tant Payment. Here|upon I hurried Home, and taking out 15<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of my Ma&s;ter's Money, I returned and di&s;|charged the Action.</P>
<P>From this Time, my fair one began to extend her Appetites, and to ri&s;e in her Pa&s;&s;ions. Under Colour of being with Child, her Longings and Fits came fre|quent upon her; and I was in a Manner con&s;trained to indulge her, till I had taken of my Ma&s;ter's Money to the amount of fi&s;ty Pounds.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, one Day, it is Time to tell you, that I mu&s;t &s;oon quit my Mantuamaking Bu&s;ine&s;s, for I am grow|ing too big to appear with Decency a|mong my Cu&s;tomers. So you mu&s;t take other Lodgings for me, and provide a &s;uf|ficient Fund to defray the many nece&s;&s;ary Expences of Child-birth. And where, my deare&s;t <HI>Sally,</HI> may &s;uch a Fund be provid|ed? I have already gone Lengths for you that may bring me to the Gallows. If you had not been a poor &s;pirited Fellow, &s;ays &s;he, you could not bear to live in the Fears that haunt you &s;o; you would long &s;ince have made away with that old Scoundrel your Ma&s;ter. Here, throw this little Du&s;t into his Broth, or his Po&s;&s;et, and then you
<PB N="151" REF="152">may wallow in Money without Fear of Account.</P>
<P>Here, I looked her full in the Face, when, every Beauty, that had once en|chanted me, &s;uddenly vani&s;hed from my Sight, and I &s;aw nothing, but the dire Head of a &s;neaky Medu&s;a. However, I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my Horror as well as I could; and, putting back the Paper, No, no, no no, <HI>Sally,</HI> &s;aid I, I would rather die the wor&s;t of Deaths, my&s;elf, than have a Hand in making away with my kind old Ma&s;ter. And die you &s;hall then, &s;he cried, for I. will not peri&s;h alone. She then dropped on her Knees and vowed, with fearful Imprecations, that &s;he would go di|rectly to Mr. <HI>Felton</HI> and make a Di&s;covery of my Robberies; that &s;he would al&s;o go to the next Magi&s;trate and &s;wear a Rape again&s;t me; and that &s;he would poi&s;on her&s;elf and the Ba&s;tard within her, that &s;he might not bring into the World any Part of &s;uch a Villain.</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, her A&s;pect looked livid and deadly, and Wrath and De&s;pera|tion fla&s;hed in Fire from her Eyes.</P>
<P>My dear <HI>Sally,</HI> &s;aid I, lower your Pa&s;&s;i|ons a little, give me that Paper again; we &s;hall &s;ee what may be done. And here I leave you my Watch, as a Pledge of my
<PB N="152" REF="153">Return by to morrow at Noon. This I did, however, not with the &s;malle&s;t Inten|tion of keeping my Promi&s;e; for I deter|mined never more to look her in the Face. But I bequeathed to her, as it were, the only Stake of Value which remained to me, that the Wretch whom I had ruined might not be left, altogether, without Means of Life.</P>
<P>When I got into the Street, I ha&s;tened homeward, without deliberating a Mo|ment, on what I was about, or on the Con&s;equences that might en&s;ue. My Ma&s;|ter was in a back Chamber, looking over &s;ome Letters, when I ru&s;hed in precipitate|ly and &s;hut the Door behind me. What is the Matter, Child, &s;ays he, are you not well? you look pale and affrighted, what is the Matter, <HI>David?</HI> O Sir, O Sir! and I &s;unk upon my Knees, I bring to you a Villain, a Reprobate, a Thief, a Robber, a Betrayer of Tru&s;ts, al&s;o, the vile&s;t Sinner that ever &s;inned again&s;t God and again&s;t Man. I got in League with a bad Wo|man who &s;educed me, by her Beauty, and then prevailed upon me to defraud and rob you, and would have per&s;uaded me to murder you, but there I &s;topt &s;hort; I could not be prevailed upon to murder you, my Ma&s;ter. Pray then, &s;aid he, &s;omewhat &s;ternly, to what Intent are you come? to demand Ju&s;tice, Sir, I cried, and
<PB N="153" REF="154">to appea&s;e my own Con&s;cience by &s;uffering for my Faults. Tell me then, &s;aid he, mildly, and tell me truly, of how much Money have you defrauded me? Of fifty Pounds, Sir, I an&s;wer'd, a few Shillings under or over. Ri&s;e then, pray ri&s;e, my <HI>David,</HI> he cried; I would not bring you to Shame, and much le&s;s to Puni&s;hment, for five times the Value of fifty Pounds. I owe you, for your Services, very nearly that Sum, and I forgive you the Remainder with all my Heart. No, Sir, I cried aloud, and bur&s;t into Tears, you do not forgive me, you cannot forgive me, for this your Goodne&s;s does but heap the heavier Guilt upon my Soul.</P>
<P>He then got up, and came to me, and rai&s;ing me to his Bo&s;om, he embraced me and cried, I rejoice over thee, my <HI>David,</HI> I rejoice over thee, my Child, as Heaven rejoiceth over the one Sinner that repent|eth, more than over the ninety and nine that have no need of Repentance. You now know your own Frailties, you are &s;en|&s;ible of your Lap&s;es, you will be cautious of future Falls, and you &s;tand upon firmer Ground than ever.</P>
<P>You know me not, I exclaimed, you know me not, my good Ma&s;ter. I am wholly irreclaimable. The Devil has ta|ken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, and reigns through
<PB N="154" REF="155">all my Members. I find it quite in vain to &s;trive or &s;truggle again&s;t him. I have no more Strength than a Midge again&s;t Temptation; no more Power than a weak and fainting Man again&s;t a Torrent that, already, has borne him far away.</P>
<P>I will pray for you, my Son, &s;aid the good Man vehemently, I will wre&s;tle with my God for you, and his Grace &s;hall be &s;ufficient. No, Sir, I replied, after that which has happened, I never &s;hall be able to look you in the Face, I will not tru&s;t my&s;elf. I know that I &s;hould fall on the fir&s;t Trial. Will you leave me then, he cried, will you leave me, my Son <HI>David?</HI> and he took out his Handkerchief and wiped away the falling Tear. I mu&s;t, I an&s;wered, I mu&s;t leave you, my deare&s;t Ma&s;ter, I &s;hould be mi&s;erable if I &s;taid. I will go directly to Sea, I will confine my|&s;elf in &s;ome Ship, where I &s;hall be &s;hut from any Commerce or Communication with Mankind, and not have it within my Reach to wrong or damage any Per&s;on. And, indeed, I could not bear to &s;tay in one Town, or even in one Kingdom with that bad Woman. Where may &s;he be found, <HI>David?</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Felton.</HI> Ah, Sir! I exclaimed, leave her to God, and to her own evil Con&s;cience, I be&s;eech you. I be|lieve &s;he is with Child by me. Do not
<PB N="155" REF="156">de&s;ire, my Ma&s;ter, to hurt a little Innocent that has not yet &s;een the Light! No, my <HI>David,</HI> no; I mean nothing but Comfort to her. I mean to &s;upply her Wants and to &s;often her Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. She will not then be tempted to wi&s;h Hurt to her Bene|factor, and I will take Care of the little Wretch which &s;he carries in her Body, for your &s;ake, my <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o affecting, Gen|tlemen, in &s;uch a Proof of wonderful Goodne&s;s, as mu&s;t have &s;truck to the Heart of the mo&s;t abandoned Reprobate. I was quite overcome thereby. I fell &s;ud|denly at his Feet, and I wi&s;hed to pour out my very Soul, in the &s;ame Manner as I poured my Tears upon them.</P>
<P>As he now found that I was bent and determined on departing, <HI>David,</HI> &s;ays he, &s;ince you will go, you mu&s;t not go unpro|vided. A Sailor ought to have with him his Che&s;t, and Cheques, and Jackets, with his Books and In&s;truments of Navigation, and &s;o forth; and, if you will give me your Company for three or four Days longer, I will look out to procure you &s;ome little Matter of Station, and get you a good Birth in &s;ome Ship or other. Mean time, I would advi&s;e you to &s;et about your Pre|parations, for which Purpo&s;e you mu&s;t ac|cept the&s;e fifty Guineas, which you may
<PB N="156" REF="157">plea&s;e to return me, when &s;ome happy Adventure &s;hall furni&s;h you with Means. No, no, Sir, I cried, putting his Pur&s;e back with my Hand, your Plan is not the Plan of your reprobate Servant; your good Stations and good Births are not at all for my Purpo&s;e. I will go as a com|mon Sailor; the meane&s;t Offices and the greate&s;t Drudgery will be a Penance, too little, much too little, for my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons. And, &s;o &s;aying, I turned, and went ha&s;tily out.</P>
<P>I made directly to the Quay, where I &s;aw a Crowd of Citizens intermixed with Sailors. On going up, I found that they were enli&s;ting Volunteers, to whom they offered from one to three Guineas <HI>per</HI> Man. And what will you give me, Cap|tain, if I go with you? He then looked earne&s;tly at me, and, having eyed me, &s;e|veral times, from Head to Foot, I will give you my Lad, &s;aid he, five Guineas in your Fi&s;t, the be&s;t Me&s;s of Pottage, the &s;nugge&s;t Hammoc to lie in, and here is my Hand for a hearty Welcome into the Bargain. If your Honour then will be plea&s;ed to order tho&s;e five Pieces to be laid out for me, in Cheques and Trow&s;ers, and &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as you think fitting; I live at &s;uch a Place, and &s;hall be ready at a Call. Enough, &s;aid the Captain, our Ship is a thirty Gun, called the <HI>Centurion,</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="158">and your Friend <HI>David Jenkins,</HI> the Com|mander of her. We &s;et out by Morning's Tide, between ten and eleven; and if you come without a Call you will be the more welcome. So &s;aying, he gave me a fami|liar Shake by the Hand, and we parted.</P>
<P>I then went directly home, and, calling Mr. <HI>Pelton</HI> a&s;ide, I told him of my Succe&s;s and Engagement in the <HI>Centurion,</HI> &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing only the Time of my early Depar|ture; for I felt that I could not &s;tand the parting with him, and I thought it be&s;t to make it as little painful to him and my&s;elf, as might be.</P>
<P>During Supper, I endeavoured to chat, but I could not. And, as Mr. <HI>Felton,</HI> at Times, looked affectionately upon me, I turned my Head a&s;ide, and a &s;ilent Tear &s;tole down my Cheek.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the Night in Sighs and Tears, and, getting up before Day, I took my Shoes in my Hand, and, &s;tepping &s;oftly down Stairs, would have &s;tolen out at the Street Door; but, in that In&s;tant, the Door of a &s;ide Parlour was opened, and, before I could look about, my Ma&s;ter had me in his Arms. Will you leave me, then, <HI>David,</HI> will you indeed leave me? he cried. O, <HI>David, David,</HI> I love you next to my
<PB N="158" REF="159">only Child. Stay with me yet, my Son, O, &s;tay with me, my <HI>David,</HI> and I will do every thing, I will do all things that may be done for you.</P>
<P>Here I &s;unk, and was ju&s;t fainting, un|der the Pre&s;&s;ure of his Goodne&s;s. Do not kill me, my Ma&s;ter, do not kill me out-right, I cried. You mu&s;t no longer be burdened by my Body of Sin and Death; as God has for&s;aken me, I mu&s;t leave you, my Ma&s;ter! let him do with me as he will, and if I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h. So &s;aying, I broke from him, and away I ru&s;hed; weeping and &s;obbing all the Way, as tho' my Heart would cleave in &s;under.</P>
<P>The Captain received me with great Cordiality, and, at times, called me his Name&s;ake, and was very familiar with me. The Sailors al&s;o, after his Example, began to affect me without any Appearance of Envy; for, though I had not been exerci&s;|ed in their Profe&s;&s;ion, yet I was &s;trong and hale and active, and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them at every Turn.</P>
<P>In the mean time, plea&s;e your Honours, it may appear very extraordinary, that, though I felt daily Compunction, and night|ly wept many Tears for having offended my God throughout the Cour&s;e of my Life; yet, I neither prayed to him, nor be&s;ought
<PB N="159" REF="160">Pardon from him, nor applied to him for any kind of Support or A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I was now incorporated with a Fraternity who&s;e Wickedne&s;s was of a Species quite different from that of my former Brother|hood. Our Sailors were &s;o far from cheat|ing or defrauding, that they &s;carce &s;eemed to have any Regard for Property; and they were as brave a Set of Fellows as ever trod a Deck. But then, they were as hardened to any Sen&s;e of Religion or Piety as the nether Mill-&s;tone; and the &s;acred and tre|mendous names of God, and his Chri&s;t, were of no other Import to them than as the Balls of a Billiard Table, to be to&s;&s;ed, and &s;tricken, and bandied about for Sport.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, this was a Matter of great Offence and Horror to me. Can there be a God, I would &s;ay to my&s;elf, and can he &s;uffer his tremendous Name to be in&s;ulted and bla&s;pherned, as it is by the&s;e Wretches? But, alas! I was not as one of the three Cap|tives at <HI>Babylon;</HI> I could not be ca&s;t into the Furnace and come forth without a Singe. In time, this Profanene&s;s became le&s;s irk|&s;ome to my Ears; and, by Degrees, I began to reli&s;h, and to catch the common Con|tagion.</P>
<P>At times, however, &s;ome Thoughts of God and a Saviour would come into my
<PB N="160" REF="161">Mind, and the pious Impre&s;&s;ions of my Infancy would return upon me; but I did my be&s;t to bani&s;h them, as they &s;erved but to torment me.</P>
<P>At times, again, I would &s;ilently ex|po&s;tulate, as it were, with God. It is true, I would &s;ay to him, I have been wicked, de&s;perately wicked, through a long Cour&s;e of &s;inning; but, did I not long &s;trive, and &s;truggle, and fight again&s;t Temptation? If you meant me for your&s;elf, why did you not make me with le&s;s Pronene&s;s to Evil; or why did you not give me greater Strength to re&s;i&s;t?</P>
<P>Again, &s;hocking and bla&s;phemous Thoughts would enter into my gloomy Soul: As though the Go&s;pel were all a Fable, and Religion nothing but Prie&s;tcraft. That all Events were of Chance. That Men were good or evil, merely according to Con&s;titution; and that, either there was no God, or he was too great, or too di&s;tant to concern him&s;elf with the in&s;ignificant Affairs of Mortals. But the&s;e Infu&s;ions of the Tempter were never of long Conti|nuance; and again I would return to <HI>believ|ing</HI> and <HI>trembling.</HI></P>
<P>Our Ship had been de&s;tinated to protect the Trade in the <HI>Levant.</HI> Within the Space of five Months, we had re&s;cued, from their
<PB N="161" REF="162">Captors, &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Built and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Property; and we had made prize from time to time of three &s;tout Frigates, of tho&s;e <HI>African</HI> Pirates who war upon the World; when the Boy from the Ma&s;t Head cried out a Sail! We immediatly made cha&s;e, and found, by Evening, that we had gained con&s;iderably upon her; but, as the Night came on thick and hazy, we &s;lacken'd our Cour&s;e, and, in a manner, lay by till Morning, but hung out no Lights.</P>
<P>At Dawn of Day, we renewed the cha&s;e, though no Sail was then in &s;ight; but we had not continued our Cour&s;e above four or five Leagues, when we clearly di&s;cerned the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, and perceived that &s;he had tacked about and was bearing down toward us.</P>
<P>Hereupon, we &s;lacked our Sails and waited for her. But, we had not waited long, till we perceived a &s;econd Ve&s;&s;el that &s;eemed in cha&s;e of the Fir&s;t; and, &s;ome time after, &s;aw a Third that &s;eemed in cha&s;e of the two former.</P>
<P>On this, the Mate, an old and experien|ced Sailor looked &s;omewhat blank, and de&s;ired that the Captain would in&s;tantly call a Council of War. Gentlemen, &s;ays he, the many Captures we have lately made
<PB N="162" REF="163">could not fail of informing our Enemies that we are in the&s;e Seas; and I apprehend, with great Rea&s;on, that they have made choice of their be&s;t Means to overreach and overmatch us, and to fall with their united Forces upon us. And, indeed, ye may already perceive that the Ship which we had in cha&s;e, has &s;lackened her Sails, and waits to be joined by her two Con&s;orts, whom &s;he &s;eemed &s;o lately to fear. I think, as the Jockeys &s;ay, that we have more than Foot for them; and all the Que&s;tion is, whether old <HI>England</HI> &s;hall make u&s;e of her Feet to fly, while &s;he has any Hands left wherewith &s;he may fight. At this, they cried, with one Voice, no flying, no flying! let them come on, the circumci&s;ed Dogs, as many as may be of them; we will neither take nor give Quarter, they or we mu&s;t to the Bottom! To work then, my brave Lads, cries Captain <HI>Jenkins,</HI> for we are likely to have as warm a Bout on't as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>To bu&s;tle went all Hands. Every Sail was fitted, the Ropes and Pullies were made pliable; and, for the fir&s;t Time, we inter|laced and bedded our Nettings. The Cap|tain then ordered all the &s;mall Arms to be gathered, and cleaned, and loaded, and laid upon Deck; and choo&s;ing, from the Company, a Dozen of the be&s;t Mark&s;men, he di&s;po&s;ed them round the Ship, under
<PB N="163" REF="164">the Shelter of the Gunnel, with Orders to bring down every Enemy, who mounted any Shrowd within the Reach of a Mu&s;ket Ball.</P>
<P>Our Ship, at this time, was full manned with about two Hundred and &s;eventy Spirits, all as ready and de&s;irous to go and meet Death, as a Beau to go to a Ball, or an Alderman to a Fe&s;tival.</P>
<P>The three Con&s;orts were now joined, as our Mate had fore&s;een, and came down in full Sail and a &s;weeping Cour&s;e upon us; and then it was that my Sins came crowd|ing into my Mind, and I believe I was the only Per&s;on of the Ship's Company who trembled.</P>
<P>They all came up with a de&s;perate Bold|ne&s;s; and, while one attacked us in Front, the others run, along &s;ide, almo&s;t clo&s;e to our Gunnel, and, expecting in&s;tantly to &s;ink us, poured the Thunder of their Can|non, on either Side, upon our Timber: While we raked the Ship, a&s;tern, with our cha&s;e Guns, and &s;hower'd upon them, on either Side, the burning Hail of our &s;mall Arms. This put them into &s;ome Con|fu&s;ion, and they &s;heered off a little Space; when, in our Turn, we &s;aluted them with a Broad&s;ide, on either Hand, which went over the Heads of their Men, but much
<PB N="164" REF="165">damaged their Rigging. To repair this, they ran up the Shrowds, as thick as Bees upon a Branch, but our Mark&s;men brought them down in a Shower upon their Decks, and, as we plentifully &s;upplied them with new-loaded Arms, in a &s;hort time there was not a Man to be &s;een among their Sails.</P>
<P>Our Ship was of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Oak, and &s;tood their Shot to a wonder; our Mettal was al&s;o much weightier than theirs; but then they outnumber'd us three to one, in Men and in Guns.</P>
<P>Having got out of the Reach of our &s;mall Shot, they moved off, as intending to make their E&s;cape; but, having repaired their Tackle, as well as time would allow, they returned upon us with twofold Re&s;olution and Fury.</P>
<P>Then it was, Gentlemen, that &s;uch a Scene was opened, as was &s;ufficient to &s;trike Hell it&s;elf with Horror.</P>
<P>They now entertained us with a new Kind of Warfare. For, getting up within Pi&s;tol &s;hot, they to&s;&s;ed their Grenadoes or Hand Shells among us, that were filled with broken Bottles, and with ru&s;ty and ragged Pieces of old Iron. The&s;e did fear|ful Execution, and our Deck was quickly covered with Blood, and Brains, and Pieces
<PB N="165" REF="166">of human Fle&s;h, while the Noi&s;e of the Cannon could &s;carcely drown the Screams of the wounded and the Groans of the dying.</P>
<P>All enraged and de&s;perate, we now tore away the Beds and Netting, that confined their Shells to our Deck, and, heaving them over-board, we lower'd the Level of our Cannon, and poured our Grape-&s;hot into the Mid&s;t of their Ships on either Side, which made horrible Havock and Uproar among them; whereupon, two of them &s;heered away as fa&s;t as their tatter'd Cordage would permit, while the third kept playing upon us at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We now had Lei&s;ure to clear our Deck, and, with &s;orrowful Hearts threw our dead and our dying Companions overboard, as al&s;o all whom we judged to be pa&s;t Re|covery. Among, our wounded was one <HI>Daniel Mc. Daniel,</HI> who had lo&s;t his right Hand by the bur&s;ting of a Shell; and, while we meant to &s;pare him, heave me over, heave me over, my Lads, he gallantly cried, &s;ince I no longer can help you, let me not be your Hindrance! No, <HI>Daniel,</HI> no, I cried, you &s;hall not be heaved off. Such a Heart, with a left Hand, may be better to us, one Day, than the two Hands of a <HI>Goliah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
Having, once more, &s;et all to Rights, we moved toward the Ve&s;&s;el that continued to annoy us, whereupon &s;he veered away and joined her Con&s;orts. We then bore down on all three, but they gave way before us and maintained a running Fight; and as they levelled their Shot almo&s;t wholly at our Rigging, by Evening we were inca|pable of further Pur&s;uit, for we had &s;carce a Yard of entire Shrowding left, and our Sails fluttered in the Wind and fell along by their Ma&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mean while, we had plied them with our Cannon as fa&s;t as we could load; and, as it began to wax du&s;ki&s;h, we perceived the Crew of the hindmo&s;t in much Confu|&s;ion, and they repeated the Signals of Di&s;|tre&s;s to their Con&s;orts. Soon after, we &s;aw them heave out their Boat, and they had &s;carce crowded in and moved off a Piece, when their Ship &s;unk outright and went plum to the Bottom. Hereon, we gave a great Shout, which we repeated on &s;eeing their Boat over&s;et. But, as the <HI>Moors</HI> are excellent Swimmers, I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t of them got &s;afe, and were taken in by their Companions. In the mean Space, our brave <HI>Daniel Mc Daniel</HI> was put out of Pain by a Grape-&s;hot in the Temple; and our mo&s;t gallant Captain <HI>Jenkins</HI> had his right Leg carried off half way up his
<PB N="167" REF="168">Thigh, by a Cannon Bullet; I think it was the la&s;t Shot the Enemy fired.</P>
<P>As I &s;tood by my Captain's Side, I catch|ed him in my Arms before he fell to the Board, and cried out for the Surgeons; but the Effu&s;ion of Blood was &s;o great, and &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;tanched, that we quickly de&s;paired of any Life for him.</P>
<P>As I &s;upported him on Deck with my right Arm, he found him&s;elf growing faint, and turned his Face to me. <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, I am not afraid to die, for I am a Chri&s;tian. I believe, as &s;urely as I am here, that Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners, of whom I am chief; and he is &s;o great and &s;o gracious, that he will not &s;uffer Hell or the Grave to di&s;appoint him of an End for which he paid &s;o dear a Price. Here, my <HI>David,</HI> here is my Pur&s;e and my Watch, which I bequeath to your Love as my la&s;t Legacy; and here is my Diamond Ring with which I entru&s;t you, as a Token to my dear Daughter, if ever it &s;hall be your Fortune to revi&s;it old <HI>Eng|land.</HI> And, if you &s;hould go to <HI>London,</HI> my dear <HI>David,</HI> enquire out my good old Friend, Alderman <HI>Bicker;</HI> tell him of my Behaviour during your Service with me, and that I be&s;eech him to u&s;e his Intere&s;t with our Protector in procuring my Pay for my poor &s;weet Child.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">
And that I will, right heartily, cried out Sir <HI>Thomas.</HI> I will al&s;o &s;peak a Word for your&s;elf, my Lad; the Protector cannot refu&s;e his Favour to one who has had the Honour of &s;erving in the Action of the <HI>Centurion,</HI> who&s;e Fame our very Enemies have &s;pread through <HI>Europe.</HI> But, pray, proceed in your Narration; I long to hear of the Event, and of your future Succe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Though we greatly grieved for our Cap|tain, we were &s;till more concerned for the Honour of <HI>England,</HI> le&s;t our good Ship &s;hould fall into the Hands of the Barbarians. For &s;he now lay like a Hulk on the Face of the Water. She could neither pur&s;ue nor avoid an Enemy; and, though &s;he had been in Plight, we had not Hands left &s;ufficient to work her.</P>
<P>Night came on apace, Ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed on both Sides; the Pirates hung out Lights to prevent, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, their parting from each other; and we mournfully called a Mu&s;ter of our Men, in the dark; where|on we found that, of two hundred and &s;eventy odd Men, we had but fifty re|maining, twenty of whom were wounded, though not di&s;abled.</P>
<P>Come, my Lads, cried the old Mate, it is as good to be merry as &s;ad. We have
<PB N="169" REF="170">wrought enough to Day to give us an Ap|petite. Let us have a Piece of Pork and a Bowl of Punch; and, if we die by Morn|ing, let us not die with cold Hearts and empty Stomachs. Moreover, for your En|couragement, I take upon me to promi&s;e that, if you will be guided, I will make you the Ma&s;ters of one of yonder Ve&s;&s;els before Sunri&s;e.</P>
<P>We engaged Compliance to a tittle; and, after Supper and a plentiful Draught, he ordered our Boats to be heaved over|board and let drive with the Wind. We then &s;et our Watch, and went down to take a few Hours Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Two Hours before Day we were rou&s;ed by our Mate, and, the fir&s;t thing we did was to bore a large Hole in the Side of our Ship, about a Foot below Water, for which we had an occa&s;ional Plug prepared.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Day dawned, we &s;et Watches at the Cabin Windows, to give us timely Notice of the Enemy's Approach; and we lay down on our &s;mall Arms, within&s;ide the Gunnel, quite out of Ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Pirates, as we pre&s;umed, held up their Gla&s;&s;es, but, &s;eeing neither Men nor Boats in our Ship, they concluded that we
<PB N="170" REF="171">had made an Elopement by Night, and came on without Precaution or Preparation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had arrived within about Half a League, our Watchmen, according to Order, drew forth the Plug, and, get|ting up Stairs, crouched down, and joined us.</P>
<P>The Con&s;orts had agreed to board our Ship on each Side, in Confidence of a rich and unre&s;i&s;ting Prize. But, the Mo|ment that we heard the fir&s;t of them ru&s;|tling along-&s;ide, and perceived that they were beginning to a&s;cend our Gunnel, we jumped up, as one Man, and &s;etting up a great Shout, and, overturning all we met, leaped into their Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Never was Amazement like that of the Enemy, they &s;carce made any Re&s;i&s;tance, and, in le&s;s than a Minute, not a Moor was left upon Deck.</P>
<P>Mean time, the other Pirate had boarded our late Ve&s;&s;el, and nearly all the Crew had now got upon Deck. They had heared, indeed, the Shout, with the Clamour and Groans of their Fellows, but did not right|ly know what to make of it; till, moving clo&s;e round the Head of our former Ship, we &s;hot the few who were left in the
<PB N="171" REF="172">&s;econd Frigate; then, throwing out our Grapplings, we towed her a Piece off, and then bored and &s;unk her in the Face of her Owners.</P>
<P>They, thereupon, &s;et up &s;uch a Yell of De&s;pair and Horror as was affecting, even to the Hearts of their Enemies. At length they turned the Cannon of the Centurion upon us; but, every Moment, we got further and further from their Shot; till, having reached to a Di&s;tance of about three Leagues, we &s;aw our good Centurion go to the Bottom, the glorious Tomb of her no|ble Captain who had fought her to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>We now thought that, of about a thou|&s;and A&s;&s;ailants, there was not one left to carry Tidings to their native Country of their Defeat. But, going down to the State-Cabin, I &s;aw a young Man richly dre&s;&s;ed, and of a noble A&s;pect, leaning wounded upon a Couch, with three Attendants about him.</P>
<P>As I enter'd, he gave me a Look that &s;eem'd compounded of Apprehen&s;ion and Courage, and acco&s;ted me in mixed <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> for he had travelled much, and re&s;ided for a Sea&s;on in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I know, &s;aid he, that I am your Pri|&s;oner; I al&s;o know what I am to expect.
<PB N="172" REF="173">Draw your Cutla&s;s then, and let me join my Countrymen! No, Sir, I replied, you have nothing to fear from me. A Man, who de&s;erves that Name, owes nothing but Love to Man, except when he is a&s;&s;ault|ed; the Brave &s;ee no Enemy in the Feeble or the Conquered.</P>
<P>Where have you learned, he cried, the Sentiments of my own Soul? but, your Genero&s;ity &s;hall lo&s;e you nothing; demand what Ran&s;om you plea&s;e and it &s;hall be paid you. I am not Commander in chief, I an&s;wered, but, as far as my Influence reaches, you are free as Air, and &s;hall be bound to us by nothing but your Affections. Then, &s;tretching forth his Arm, your Hand, my Brother! he cried, and giving me a kind Squeeze, the Tear came into his Eye.</P>
<P>I went directly on Deck and informed our little Crew, now reduced to thirty three, of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the noble Moor and my&s;elf, and told them, I hoped they would be &s;o generous as to make my Promi&s;e good. To this the greater Number gladly a&s;&s;ented, but &s;ome of them murmured. Hereupon, I remon|&s;trated that we were already rich enough, for we had taken all the Plate and Money, with what was mo&s;t valuable and portable, out of our own Ship, be&s;ide the Trea&s;ure in the pirate Frigate which we had not
<PB N="173" REF="174">yet divided. I further repre&s;ented, that we knew not what the Events of War or For|tune might be; and that it would not be imprudent to make a Friend on the <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t, who, in all Appearance, was a Per|&s;on of high Con&s;ideration; and, with the&s;e Rea&s;ons, at length, all appeared to be &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>I then carried the plea&s;ing Tidings to my new Friend, and took with me our only &s;ur|viving Surgeon, who dre&s;&s;ed the Wound in his Thigh, which had been made by a Mu&s;ket Ball.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Surgeon had withdrawn, the noble <HI>O&s;myn</HI> of <HI>Petra,</HI> for &s;o he was called, pre&s;ented me with his Pur&s;e, and a Carbuncle Ring of extraordinary Value, and pre&s;&s;ed them earne&s;tly upon me; but I as peremptorily refu&s;ed them, and this Re|fu&s;al appeared to di&s;tre&s;s him greatly.</P>
<P>During the five Days in which we con|tinued together, I had him as tenderly and as honourably attended as our Circum|&s;tances would admit; and I &s;pent with him all the Time I could &s;pare from my Duties and great Fatigues upon Deck, as all the Hands we had were kept bu&s;ily employed in &s;plicing the Ropes, refitting the mangled Sails and Rigging, and in repairing the Breaches of the Ve&s;&s;el; for our Cannon had
<PB N="174" REF="175">bored her Sides quite through in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>On the&s;e Accounts we &s;ailed but heavily, &s;till making toward the Straits, and daily wi&s;hing to meet or be overtaken by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship of Force, to which we might &s;afely confide our&s;elves and our Trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth Morning, having arrived within twenty Leagues of the Mouth, the Day di&s;covered to us that we were almo&s;t within Shot of a Ship of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Built, and that carried <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours. Hereat we rejoiced with exceeding great Joy, and &s;lackening our Sail, and heaving out a &s;mall Boat, ten of us &s;lipt into it, and away we rowed with all our might. As we ap|proached, we &s;aw Numbers, in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dre&s;&s;es, walking to and again on Deck; and, getting along&s;ide, they threw Ropes over to us, and we mounted with great Alacrity.</P>
<P>Hitherto we were &s;o intoxicated with Joy, that we had not the Precaution to hail them, till we found our&s;elves in the very thick of our Enemies. I looked round, and, &s;eeing none but tawny and ho&s;tile Faces about me, I civilly demanded who, and of what Country they were; when a Ruffian, gathering his Spittle, &s;pirted it full in my Face, and, at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="175" REF="176">gave me a Buffet on the Side of my Cheek. Then, I did not once reflect either where or among whom I was, but, with one Stroke of my Fi&s;t, I &s;tretched him &s;tiff along the Deck: Then, throwing up the Heels of another, who had rai&s;ed his Arm again&s;t me, he fell with his Head foremo&s;t acro&s;s his Fellow; and twi&s;ting round on a third, who had &s;eized me behind by the Shoulder, I dragged him under me, and we fell together upon the Board. Here a Crowd of them gather'd over me, and, each helping to hold a Leg or an Arm, I was bound with Cords that cru&s;hed my Fle&s;h to the very Bone, and then tumbled with Kicks, like a Dog, along the Deck.</P>
<P>Mean time, my nine Companions, who had offered to interpo&s;e, were al&s;o &s;eized and bound, and ca&s;t into the Hold.</P>
<P>For about three Hours I lay in ex|ce&s;&s;ive Angui&s;h, though, through a Sort of &s;tubborn Pride, I endeavoured to &s;up|pre&s;s my Groans. In the Interim I felt the Ship begin to move, and, &s;oon after, I perceived all in Bu&s;tle about me, for I could &s;ee nothing that happened without|&s;ide the Gunnel. Again I heared, from within and without, &s;everal Di&s;charges of &s;mall Arms, and, as I &s;aw &s;everal <HI>Moors</HI> fall lifele&s;s or convul&s;ed and biting the Deck around me, I rightly concluded that
<PB N="176" REF="177">the Ships were engaged. I gave a long and deep Groan, and I cried aloud, O, my Countrymen, my brave Countrymen! why am I not with you, why have I not the Happine&s;s of dying with you and for you? and my Heart was &s;o wrung that I fainted quite away.</P>
<P>I afterward learned that my true and valiant Fellows had refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit up|on Summons. That the Pirate, &s;eeing them &s;o few, and being de&s;irous of &s;aving the Frigate for their own U&s;e, had attack|ed them with &s;mall Arms, which were warmly an&s;wered, on our Part; when, hav|ing dropped or di&s;abled above Half of our brave <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with two of <HI>O&s;myn</HI>'s At|tendants who happened to be upon Deck, they enter'd and mercile&s;sly butcher'd the Remainder, among whom was our old Mate and Surgeon.</P>
<P>Mean &s;pace, I lay in&s;en&s;ible to all that pa&s;&s;ed, till a Ruffian, &s;eeing me pale and lifele&s;s, in all Appearance, gave me a Wring by the No&s;e. Hereupon I awaked to the bittere&s;t Sen&s;ations. I remember'd me of my gallant Me&s;&s;mates, who had &s;o loved and care&s;&s;ed me above my Merits; and my Tears, without Sigh or Groan, went in a River down my Cheeks.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">
At length, I heared a Voice, a known Voice as I thought, crying, where is my Friend, where is my Brother <HI>David?</HI> and, turning my Head a little, I &s;aw my noble <HI>O&s;myn</HI> ju&s;t entering the Ship.</P>
<P>O, Gentlemen! be not apt to judge hardly of all who have not learned <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by the Form and by the Letter. <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> my <HI>O&s;myn</HI> proves that he may be in the Heart of tho&s;e who never acknowledged his Name, altho' they have felt his Power. And, indeed, as the Apo&s;tle writes, tho&s;e, who never learned his Law, yet, having his Law, or rather Him&s;elf, in their Hearts, &s;hall be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Having in&s;tantly ca&s;t an Eye of &s;earch|ing Love around, he &s;pied where I lay, and coming, and throwing him&s;elf be&s;ide me, he put one Arm about me, and cried, O, my Brother, my Brother <HI>David,</HI> is it thus that my People u&s;e you? I grieve that you, Chri&s;tians, &s;hould beat us, all to nothing, in Honour and Humanity. He then took out his Knife, and having tenderly cut my Cords, he &s;trained his own Ability, to help me to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>He then called for the Captain who came, bowing to him with great Re&s;pect. Their Di&s;cour&s;e was long and earne&s;t. At
<PB N="178" REF="179">length <HI>O&s;myn</HI> ro&s;e high in Pa&s;&s;ion, and gave the Captain a back Stroke with his Hand acro&s;s the Face. I ob&s;erved his Choler &s;welling, almo&s;t to Suffocation, but he &s;uppre&s;s'd his Indignation, and retired in Silence. I heard <HI>O&s;myn</HI> then giving &s;ome Orders to the Men, but, as I was a Stranger to their Language, I knew not the Purport of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed. Soon after, however, I &s;aw my nine Com|panions brought from the Hold, and un|bound. And <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> turning to me, de|&s;ired me to tell my People that they were all free, and that, as &s;oon as we landed in <HI>Barbary,</HI> he would take the fir&s;t Means of &s;ending them with Honour to their native Country. Ah, my Lord, I cried, I am &s;orry that you &s;truck the Captain, he has many Adherents here, and will certainly &s;eek &s;ome Method of Revenge. He dare not, he dare not, replied my Friend; the Villain would have di&s;puted with me the Property of my own Frigate, which I manned, and fitted out, at my own Ex|pence. But, if I hear or &s;ee any more of his In&s;olence, as &s;oon as we land I will complain to the <HI>Dey</HI> my Uncle, and have the Rogue impaled alive.</P>
<P>He then ordered out the long Boat, and turning to me, &s;aid, I am going, <HI>David,</HI> to take an Account of what Effects are left in my Ship; and, I would take you with
<PB N="179" REF="180">me, if you were in a Condition to go; but I will &s;oon return, and, in the mean Time, order the Surgeon to do his be&s;t for allay|ing the Swelling in your Limbs.</P>
<P>During his Ab&s;ence, the Ship's Compa|ny and even the Captain, who&s;e Name was <HI>Barbar,</HI> behaved them&s;elves toward me and my Fellows with great, though &s;ilent, Civility; and a plentiful Me&s;s was &s;erved up to us for Dinner. But, during our Repa&s;t, I ob&s;erved that the Captain called &s;uch and &s;uch of his Men to the Quarter-deck, where he held with them a long and whi&s;pering kind of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fellows, as it &s;eems, were the mo&s;t barbarous and bloody of all their barbarous and bloody Countrymen. Hav|ing taken the Ship wherein we then were, a Merchantman, carrying about twenty Guns, they had ma&s;&s;acred every Creature on board, and then dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in the Clothes of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in order to in|veigle others into the like Calamity; while they di&s;patched their own Frigate back to <HI>Tunis</HI> to get Recruits.</P>
<P>My noble Friend did not return till late in the Evening. He then order'd Supper to be got ready, and the State-Cabin to be prepared for him and I to lie in; but I whi&s;pered and be&s;ought him to excu&s;e me
<PB N="180" REF="181">for declining that Honour, as I perceived that the Favours which he did me, had, already, given much Umbrage and Offence to his Countrymen.</P>
<P>I know not whence, or for what Pur|po&s;e, Forebodings may come; but, all that Night, my Spirits were exceedingly &s;ad and depre&s;&s;ed; and, though my Fellows and I were put to lie in a Part of the Ship, the mo&s;t remote from my Friend; yet, I imagined that I heard &s;ecret Treadings and Mutterings; and again, at dead of Night, that I heard the di&s;tant Sound of trampling and &s;truggling, as of People in doing and receiving Violence.</P>
<P>I was &s;till &s;ore, from the Tyings and the Brui&s;es which I had received; when, to|ward the End of a &s;leeple&s;s Night, a Gang of armed Ruffians enter'd the Place where we lay, and loaded us with Irons. They then took away all our Clothes and Trea|&s;ures, and threw to each of us, a Canvas Shirt and Drawers, as Slaves prepared for the Market.</P>
<P>The Moment they laid their Hands up|on me, it occured that they would not have dared to do it, if they had not fir&s;t made away with my dear Friend and Pa|tron; at which Thought, my Soul grew
<PB N="181" REF="182">in&s;tantly &s;ick, and a dark Cloud of Sorrow fell heavily upon it.</P>
<P>Sore and &s;hackled as I was, I got im|mediately on Deck, and looked wi&s;tfully out to Sea, but could di&s;cover no Frigate. I then &s;huffled along, as fa&s;t as I could, to the Cabin where I had parted the Night before with my <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> and, looking in at the Door, I cried aloud, where are you Lord <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> where are you, my Ma&s;ter, my Friend, my dear <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> where are you, where are you?</P>
<P>When no An&s;wer could be had, I re|turned, wild with Rage and Grief, and notwith&s;tanding my Chains, had I not been di&s;abled by my Contu&s;ions, I &s;hould have done my be&s;t to throttle every Man I met. But all I could do was, to wring my Hands, and roar aloud to all around, yet Butchers, ye Cut-throats, ye Villains of all Villains! what have ye done with your Lord, what have ye done with your Ma&s;ter, what have ye done with my Friend, with my <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> my <HI>O&s;myn?</HI></P>
<P>For two Nights and two Days, I ta&s;ted nothing but Water, which I drank in large Quantities, as my Soul, as well as Body, was in a Ferment and a Fever. On the third Day, the Captain, fearing that I would die of Grief, and that he &s;hould lo&s;e
<PB N="182" REF="183">what he propo&s;ed to get by my Sale, &s;ent a kind of Interpreter to me, to let me know, that, on the Night in which I part|ed with <HI>O&s;ymn,</HI> he and the Captain, &s;oon after, had &s;ome warm Words concerning their Rights in the Frigate, and in the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> now on board; whereupon <HI>O&s;myn</HI> &s;wore that he would not remain any longer in his Ship; and that, taking with him a Number of Hands, he reimbarked in the Frigate, and directly &s;et Sail.</P>
<P>As this Tale carried with it &s;ome Face of a Fact, I grew ea&s;ier in my Mind; and, on the very Day following, having anchor|ed in the Bay of <HI>Algiers,</HI> my Fellows and I were taken into the Town, and &s;old at public Market.</P>
<P>I happened to be bought by one of the <HI>Dey</HI>'s Factors, who immediately &s;ent me to the Work at his Country Palace.</P>
<P>This Work was a mo&s;t &s;tupendous Un|dertaking. Above five hundred Men had been daily employed in it for two Years pa&s;t, and yet a third of it was not done when I arrived.</P>
<P>A large Lawn extended it&s;elf in the Front of the Palace, and here the <HI>Dey</HI> had or|dered a great Canal to be dug, and, from its Excavation a Mount to be rai&s;ed, who&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="184">Ba&s;e mea&s;ured three hundred Yards in Circumference. The A&s;cent was ea&s;y and &s;piral, much re&s;embling the Prints you have &s;een of the Tower of <HI>Babel.</HI> The Border of this A&s;cent was adorned, all the way, with lofty Cedars interlaced with all Sorts of aromatic and flowering Shrubs; and, from the top, before I left it, was to be &s;een the Bay, the Shipping, the City, and Country all around, while di&s;tant Mountains, on the one Hand, and an Ex|tent of Ocean, on the other, alone bound|ed the Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>You will think it very extraordinary, Gentlemen, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that, till I was in a State of Slavery, my Mind never was free. Hitherto I had been the Slave of Sin, and of Appetite, of Pa&s;&s;ions, and of Fears. But, here I counted to &s;et up my Re&s;t for Life. I had no Parents, no wealthy Kindred, no Friend upon Earth, to whom I might look for a Pennyworth of Ran&s;om. There was, therefore, no further Pro&s;pect for me, there was no|thing further left to excite my De&s;ire, or to excite my Concern; and I &s;unk gradu|ally, as it were, down into the Peace of my own nothingne&s;s.</P>
<P>I had been lately the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Value of &s;ome Thou&s;ands, and, now, I had not wherewithal to purcha&s;e a Mor&s;el of
<PB N="184" REF="185">Bread. But, I looked back on the many Scenes of my very many Wickedne&s;&s;es, and I did not look up, but looked down to my God, and cried, Not enough, it is not yet enough, O Lord! &s;omething &s;harper, &s;ome|thing heavier! &s;ome Puni&s;hment that may expiate, and reconcile me to my God!</P>
<P>One Night, as I lay on my Bed of Stubble, I looked up to God, through the Cloud of my own Iniquities, and &s;aid, In Life, O my Lord, lay what thou plea&s;e&s;t upon me, but, in the Hour of Death, &s;ave, &s;ave me from the Judgment! whereupon, &s;omething within me, &s;aid, Fear not, thou vile Wretch, fear not thou Worm <HI>David,</HI> for nothing &s;hall be able to pluck thee out of my Hands. This gave me great Con|&s;olation, and Con&s;olation was followed by Peace, and Peace was followed by Plea|&s;ure; in&s;omuch, that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more of the Sweetne&s;s of Heart-felt Enjoyment, than came to the Share of twenty Sen&s;ua|li&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Dey or Regent, then being, was called <HI>Ali Eben Buchar.</HI> He was a great Warrior, and yet a Man of an amiable Character, which is rarely the Ca&s;e with Moori&s;h Governors. He had been at <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> when I was en&s;laved; and, on his Return, he was &s;o &s;olicitou&s;ly engaged
<PB N="185" REF="186">in Matters of State, that he was not at lei&s;ure to come and &s;ee our Works. To|ward the End of the &s;econd Year of my Servitude, he arrived with a pompous Train, and in a Chariot drawn by Tygers. He was a portly and comely Per&s;onage, though his Complexion was a deep olive. He expre&s;&s;ed high Delight, on &s;urveying what we had done; and he ordered a Fe&s;tival, of three Days, to be proclaimed for his Labourers, with Sports, and martial Exerci&s;es, and Prizes for the Victors.</P>
<P>Great Preparations were made for this Entertainment. In a Plain, on the left of the Palace, a Square of half a Mile Dia|meter was enclo&s;ed with Pales; within which none were permitted to enter, &s;ave the Dey and his Train, with tho&s;e who la|boured in his &s;everal Works, amounting to about a thou&s;and Men. On one Side, within the Pales, a Throne was erected with two Seats, and lower Benches were placed on either Hand.</P>
<P>Early on the Morning of the fir&s;t ap|pointed Day, the Fe&s;tival was opened by the Sound of Trumpets and Horns, and other martial In&s;truments.</P>
<P>It had been a Cu&s;tom, among us of the Labourers who were young and active, when the Day's Work was over, to divert
<PB N="186" REF="187">our Fellows with various Exerci&s;es and Feats, &s;uch as Wre&s;tling, Running, Leap|ing, and to&s;&s;ing or trundling Leaden Balls, and &s;o forth; I was, therefore, up a|mong the &s;oone&s;t, in hopes of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing my&s;elf on the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>By the Dawning, the City was emptied of its Inhabitants, and Crowds came on, after Crowds, from all Parts of the Coun|try, &s;o that the Pales were &s;oon circled by an innumerable Concour&s;e.</P>
<P>Then came <HI>Ali,</HI> with his Attendants, and, entering the Pale, a&s;cended his Throne. His favourite Sultana was placed on his left, and his Concubines took their Places on either Side, and his Courtiers and Guards arranged them&s;elves behind.</P>
<P>Then were exalted, on Poles, the Prizes that were to be given to &s;uch of the Slaves or Labourers as excelled in to&s;&s;ing the Ja|velin, or in hitting a di&s;tant Mark with the Bow or with the Sling. But, as I had not been practi&s;ed in the&s;e Matters, I content|ed my&s;elf, for this Day, with being a Spectator. Some of the Candidates, on this Occa&s;ion, were extremely expert, and would &s;end an Arrow or &s;ling a Stone more directly to the Mark, than any <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> could &s;hoot a Mu&s;ket Bullet; ac|cordingly, the generous <HI>Ali</HI> added Free|dom
<PB N="187" REF="188">to the Prizes which they had won, and immediately preferred them among his Troops.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Ali,</HI> to entertain his People, ordered a Dozen of his Courtiers to run at the Ring. Immediately a Number of neighing Steeds, richly capari&s;on'd, were led by Lackeys into the Li&s;ts. The young Nobles, without Stirrup or Saddle, vaulted lightly into their Seats, and turning, and winding their fiery Hor&s;es, with wonderful Command and Addre&s;s, gave high Delight to the Spectators. Each of them then caught a Javelin which was to&s;&s;ed to him by an Attendant; and, &s;etting out, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, almo&s;t at their Speed, three of them, in mid Cour&s;e, bore off a &s;mall Ring of Bra&s;s, from the Thread by which it hung, on the Point of his Lance.</P>
<P>After this, again, a great Number of burle&s;que Comedians enter'd the Pales, in order to act one of their <HI>African</HI> Drolls or Pantomimes; &s;ome of them repre&s;ented Men, &s;ome Tygers, Hogs, and Bears; others Gho&s;ts, and others Goblins. But I could make nothing of &s;uch a Jumblement of Intention, although it gave great Di|ver&s;ion to the Populace. And thus ended the Sports of the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">
While the People retired homeward, &s;everal Waggons were drawn in, heavy laden with Victuals and Liquors, where|with all the Slaves and Labourers were plentifully regaled.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Day was u&s;her'd in with the like Pomp, as the former; and Prizes were &s;et up for lifting the Weight, for to&s;&s;ing the Colt, and for pitching the Bar.</P>
<P>At a little Di&s;tance from the Front of the Throne, a Ring was fa&s;tened to a leaden Ma&s;s, that weighed about five hun|dred Pounds, and above fifty Adventurers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attempted to lift, but, not a Man of them could move it. I then ad|vanced, bowing lowly toward the Throne, and putting my right Hand in the Ring, and exerting my Powers, I rai&s;ed it fairly from the Ground, whereupon a great Shout was &s;uddenly given by all my Companions who wrought with me at the Mount. Hereupon a Black came up, of Herculean Bulk and Brawn, and, de&s;iring that fifty Pounds more &s;hould be added to the Lead, he lifted and &s;wung them in the Air with apparent Ea&s;e, and the Prize was accord|ingly adjudged to him.</P>
<P>A large Iron Coit was then given to the Competitors, and, about a Dozen of them
<PB N="189" REF="190">to&s;&s;ed it to a Di&s;tance that was thought ex|traordinary. I then took it up, and threw it three Foot beyond the furthe&s;t. But again, the black Slave came up, who was not of our Company, and to&s;&s;ed it two Foot beyond my Ca&s;t, and con&s;equently atchieved the &s;econd Prize.</P>
<P>A long and ma&s;&s;ive Bar was then pre&s;ent|ed to us, but all refu&s;ed to take it in Hand, till the &s;ame Black &s;eized it, and, putting one End to his Foot, pitched it off to a Di&s;tance that rai&s;ed a Cry of Admiration. I then took my Turn, and giving my whole Strength and Action to this &s;ingle Ca&s;t, I pitched it &s;ome Inches beyond the Throw of my Rival, whereupon another Shout was given and repeated. The Black, then, was wholly enflamed by Envy and Re&s;entment, and reclaiming the Bar, and exerting all his Force, he threw it to a Length, that, on Admea&s;urement, was judged to exceed my Ca&s;t, and he proudly laid hold on the third Prize.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Ali</HI> then ordered me to be brought before him. I went, and, bend|ing on my Knee, laid my Head to the Earth. Ri&s;e, &s;aid he; I obeyed, and he &s;urveyed me with long and earne&s;t Atten|tion. Young Man, he cried, you have been this Day &s;omething unfortunate, but you have not the le&s;s Merit; put this Ring
<PB N="190" REF="191">on your Finger, it di&s;charges you, hence|forth, from all Kind of Labour; but it does not enfranchi&s;e you, becau&s;e, for the pre&s;ent, I do not choo&s;e to part with you. I re&s;pectfully took the Ring, and, again bowing to the Ground, retired in Silence.</P>
<P>A Tournament of the young Nobles then en&s;ued, wherein great Feats of Action and Prowe&s;s was &s;hewn. And the Day ended with another Droll to which I gave no heed.</P>
<P>The Morning of the third Day was o|pened as u&s;ual, and Prizes were exhibited for Wre&s;tling, for Running, and for Leaping.</P>
<P>Immediately the black Champion &s;tep|ped formidably forth, and challenged any to approach, who de&s;ired to be cru&s;hed to Death, but not a Man accepted this cha|ritable Invitation. Unwilling, then, that this Boa&s;ter &s;hould carry off the Prize, without a Conte&s;t, I &s;tepped from my Rank, depending more upon Action than Force to cope with him. We both &s;trip|ped to our Canvas Drawers, and his Looks and Ge&s;tures menaced me with in&s;tant De|&s;truction. I advanced, however, to e&s;&s;ay him, and he &s;tretched his Arms toward me, as a Vulture would reach his Pounces to &s;eize upon a Chicken; when, &s;pringing in&s;tantly up to him, I put a Hand upon
<PB N="191" REF="192">each of his Shoulders, and, vaulting lightly over his Head, I turned nimbly upon him, threw up his Heels, and laid him &s;idelong on the Earth.</P>
<P>As the Contra&s;t of our Colours had ren|der'd us remarkable to all the Spectators, a Shout was &s;et up that rent the very Elements. But the Black ro&s;e, and roared aloud, with his Lion-like Voice, for Ju&s;|tice; and the Judges, on weighing the Matter, appointed me to another Trial, forbidding further Fraud.</P>
<P>Again we prepared to engage, and again my black Adver&s;ary &s;tretched forth his Arms, with Eyes fla&s;hing Fire, and Fea|tures di&s;torted with Rage; when, retiring from him, as if di&s;mayed, I &s;hot forward like Lightening, and, &s;pringing from the Ground, I pitched the whole Weight of my Body into his Bo&s;om. This &s;tagger'd him &s;ome Steps backward, when, conti|nuing to pre&s;s upon him, I put one Foot behind, and he fell under me, with a horrible Squelch, upon the Sand; and, da&s;hing my Hand again&s;t his Forehead, I &s;prung up lightly on my Feet.</P>
<P>Here, the People repeated their Cla|mours, which were echoed for a long Space from Side to Side; while I propo&s;ed to
<PB N="192" REF="193">the Judges that, if my Rival was not yet &s;atisfied, I would give him the other Ven|ture. But the Black was &s;o far from being in Plight for a third Engagement, that he could not ri&s;e without Help on either Hand; and the Prize, being a fine Tur|ban with a Diamond Button, was put upon my Head.</P>
<P>The Competitors for the Race then came from among the Crowd, being fif|teen in Number, lightly equipt for the Pur|po&s;e; and I al&s;o put on a thin Canvas Wai&s;tcoat that came clo&s;e to my Body.</P>
<P>In the Front of the Throne, a long Pole was &s;et up, from whence we were to &s;tart; and another Pole was erected on the further Side, round which we were to run, and &s;o return to the Po&s;t from whence we &s;et out.</P>
<P>We were all arranged in a Line, and <HI>Ali</HI> him&s;elf was to give the Word, when one of our Fellows, either thinking or pre|tending to think that the Word was given, &s;tarted away, the re&s;t followed, and I was left alone, quietly &s;tanding by the Po&s;t. Why don't you &s;et out? &s;aid <HI>Ali;</HI> when your Highne&s;s &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give the Word. Away then! he cried, and away I &s;prung.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
As I found that I was gathering them up very fa&s;t, I &s;u&s;pended my Speed, and linger'd behind the hindmo&s;t, till they had all turned the Po&s;t, and extended in a long Line before me. I then &s;tarted away, and pa&s;&s;ed one, and then another, till, having pa&s;&s;ed them all, I left the ore|mo&s;t at a Di&s;tance behind me, and &s;eized the Goal; whereon <HI>Ali</HI> him&s;elf gave a Cry of Admiration, which was an&s;wered, from all Sides, by all his People.</P>
<P>I was then pre&s;ented with a Velvet Tunic, embroider'd with Gold; and &s;ome &s;maller Matters were given to the two who came next to me in Speed.</P>
<P>The Candidates for the third Prize then ro&s;e from the Ground where they had &s;at to repo&s;e them&s;elves; for they were the &s;ame Per&s;ons who had been Competitors in the Race. A &s;carlet Girdle was &s;tretched along the Gra&s;s, as a Mark from whence the Rivals were to &s;et off on their Leap. And each of them took a Run, till they came to the appointed Limit, and then &s;prung forward with their utmo&s;t Agility.</P>
<P>As this, of all others, was the Article of bodily Exerci&s;e wherein I excelled, I &s;tood by, as an unconcerned Spectator,
<PB N="194" REF="195">till the Conte&s;t was over. I then mea&s;ur|ed with my Eye the Length they had pa&s;&s;ed. Then, taking two Men, I &s;et them in Mid-&s;pace, and, placing a Pole upon their Heads, I took a run, and, throwing my&s;elf Head foremo&s;t over the Pole, I turned in the Air, and alighted &s;ix Inches beyond the furthe&s;t Leap; where|upon I was pre&s;ented with a Collar adorned with Gems of great Lu&s;tre.</P>
<P><HI>Ali</HI> then ordered two Troops of his lighte&s;t Hor&s;e to come forward. Accor|dingly they enter'd the Pale, and dividing, they retired to oppo&s;ite Sides of the Li&s;ts. The Populace then fell back and cleared the mean Space, and the young Officers &s;et forward, on a half Gallop, at the Head of their Troops.</P>
<P>Never did I &s;ee &s;uch Action, &s;uch Hor&s;e|man&s;hip. The Officers, as they rode &s;wift|ly forward, would to&s;s their Lances aloft and then catch them in mid Air; and again they would ca&s;t them to a Di&s;tance before them, and &s;tooping, take them from the Ground in the Mid&s;t of their Speed.</P>
<P>The Troops then met, as &s;hould &s;eem, in mortal Oppo&s;ition; and, breaking their frail Lances again&s;t each other, they drew their Wooden Sabres, and each, pa&s;&s;ing his Adver&s;ary, gave a back Stroke to his
<PB N="195" REF="196">Neck, with &s;uch Force and Agility as was truly alarming. Their Ranks then ap|peared to be broken on either Part. And, in&s;tantly, forming them&s;elves into little Rhombs, or Squares, or Wedges, they fought and mixed together, as in a Coun|try Dance, with the mo&s;t regular Confu&s;ion that ever was beheld.</P>
<P>This was ju&s;tly delightful to all the Spectators; and I regretted their Departure, with the ridiculous Entrance of a third Pantomime.</P>
<P>While this Droll was preparing, I re|ceived an Order from <HI>Ali,</HI> to dre&s;s my&s;elf in the Prizes which I had won, and to at|tend him.</P>
<P>I obeyed, and pre&s;ented my&s;elf before him. What is your Name, young Man? <HI>David,</HI> &s;o plea&s;e your Highne&s;s. Are you of Chri&s;t or of <HI>Mahomet, David?</HI> My Will is with Chri&s;t, &s;o plea&s;e you, but, while I confe&s;s him with my Lips, my whole Life has denied him. Then, <HI>David,</HI> if you will but for&s;ake Chri&s;t, and turn to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> you &s;hall be the Friend of <HI>Ali,</HI> and he will heap Trea&s;ures, and Titles, and great Honours upon you. Ah, my Lord! I cried out, though I hold my Chri&s;t but by a frail and feeble Thread, yet I would not quit that Thread for a
<PB N="196" REF="197">Chain of golden Links that &s;hould bind the whole Wealth of the World to my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on. And, why would your Highne&s;s de|&s;ire the Service of a Traitor? He, who proves a Traitor to his God, &s;o plea&s;e you, can never prove true to any Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he mildly, we may talk of the&s;e Matters hereafter. In the mean Space, before I do you any Grace, I ought at lea&s;t to do you Ju&s;tice. You have already received the Rewards of your Valour and your Action, but you have not yet received the Reward of your Obedience. You were the only one, brave <HI>David,</HI> who, at the Ri&s;que of your own Honour, attend|ed on my Word, and here I give you an Earne&s;t of the Recompence that I intend you.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he pre&s;ented me with a large and ma&s;&s;ive Sabre, who&s;e Handle was &s;tud|ded with Gems of great Value. I received it on my Knee, and he then continued, A&s;k me now, <HI>David,</HI> what further Gift you demand, except your Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and it &s;hall be granted you, to a Tenth of the Trea&s;ure in my Coffers.</P>
<P>When he had &s;poken, my Eye was caught by one of his Retinue, and imme|diatly I recollected the Features of the Pirate <HI>Barbar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">
I, in&s;tantly, ca&s;t my&s;elf pro&s;trate before his Throne, and cried aloud, Ah, gene|rous <HI>Ali!</HI> may God multiply to you Trea|&s;ures and Ble&s;&s;ings a thou&s;and fold! I a&s;k none of your Trea&s;ures or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, O <HI>Ali!</HI> I only a&s;k the Head of that Traitor, the Head of <HI>Barbar;</HI> I a&s;k but Blood for Blood: Let him re&s;tore to me my Friend, my Brother, my Lord <HI>O&s;myn;</HI> he is a Murderer, a Traitor, and &s;uch I will prove him, by Night or by Day, by Sea or by Land, at any Weapons, again&s;t any Odds, I will prove him a Traitor.</P>
<P>While I &s;poke, thus impa&s;&s;ioned, all about appeared under the utmo&s;t Con&s;ter|nation; and <HI>Barbar</HI> trembled and turned pale, but did not dare to quit his Station.</P>
<P>Ri&s;e, <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Ali,</HI> and tell me what Friend, what <HI>O&s;myn</HI> thou do&s;t mean? All I know of him, my Lord, is that his Name was <HI>O&s;myn</HI> of <HI>Petra,</HI> and that he was Nephew to &s;ome great Prince in this Part of the World.</P>
<P>Why, you dream &s;urely, <HI>David,</HI> replied the Regent, <HI>O&s;myn</HI> of <HI>Petra</HI> was my own Nephew; and he peri&s;hed, with all his Crew, by the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">
He did not peri&s;h by the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I cried; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were his Pre|&s;ervers, his Friends, his Attendants, and he peri&s;hed by the Hands of his own Countrymen, and more e&s;pecially by the Hands of this Traitor <HI>Barbar.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid <HI>Ali,</HI> we have not Lei&s;ure, at pre&s;ent, to examine into the Truth of the&s;e Allegations; Guards, take that <HI>Barbar</HI> into &s;afe and clo&s;e Cu&s;tody till we are better informed, touching the Facts with which he is charged. Mean time, do you, <HI>David,</HI> follow in my Train, for you mu&s;t take up your Lodging with me, this Night.</P>
<P>The Place, though it appeared one uniform Edifice, was divided into two by an impa&s;&s;able Barrier. The one was the occa&s;ional Habitation of <HI>Ali</HI> and his At|tendants: And his Wives, with their Eunuchs, were lodged in the other, where it was Impalement for any Man, &s;ave <HI>Ali</HI> him&s;elf, to enter.</P>
<P>The generous <HI>Ali</HI> was not of a jealous Temper. He gave his Women uncommon Liberties, as you have &s;een; for tho' they were kept, by their Veils, from the Eyes of the Vulgar; yet tho&s;e Veils were of &s;o very thin a Gauze, that they could clearly di&s;cern every Object about them.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">
For three Days and Nights, after I en|ter'd his Palace, though I was treated with an Attention that gave me much Unea&s;i|ne&s;s, yet I had not the Honour of being called to his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>At length I was conducted by a private Door to his Cabinet. My Friend <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, what ha&s;t thou to tell me, con|cerning my dear and brave Nephew <HI>O&s;myn?</HI> I then minutely, and at large, recited to him the Particulars above related And we &s;hed many Tears, that were mutually pro|voked by the Tears of each other.</P>
<P>Having clo&s;ed my Narration, he ca&s;t his Eyes down, awhile, as in deep Medita|tion; and rai&s;ing them again, he &s;aid, the Pre&s;umptions are &s;trong, very &s;trong again&s;t this Man, and yet there is a Po&s;&s;ibility that he may be guiltle&s;s. And though <HI>O&s;myn</HI> is my Nephew, my Blood, and almo&s;t my Bowels, yet Honour, Humanity demands of us, <HI>David,</HI> that nine Criminals &s;hould e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment they de&s;erve, rather than one innocent Per&s;on &s;hould peri&s;h in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. But, the great <HI>Alla</HI> may give us further Lights in this Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In about five Days after, a Convict was to be gaunched for the Rape and Murder of a free Woman. He was to be thrown
<PB N="200" REF="201">from the Top of a high Tower, from who&s;e Walls projected &s;everal &s;harp and &s;hagged In&s;truments, re&s;embling Hooks, Scythes, Tenters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at certain Di&s;tances, &s;ome below others.</P>
<P>He fainted &s;everal times as he was car|rying to Execution; and then, being in an Agony, he &s;aid he had a Matter of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence to impart to the great <HI>Ali,</HI> and prayed to be brought directly into his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I was on the Spot when he was led in, and, looking earne&s;tly at him, recollected that he was the Ruffian who had &s;pit in my Face and given me a Buffet when I enter'd <HI>Barbar</HI>'s Ship.</P>
<P>Wretch, cried the Dey, what ha&s;t thou to &s;ay to <HI>Ali?</HI> That I am guilty, an&s;wered the Convict, of Crimes more heinous and capital than that for which I am to &s;uffer, of Crimes that nearly concern your&s;elf, O <HI>Ali,</HI> but which you &s;hall never know, un|le&s;s you &s;wear to me, by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> to miti|gate the Manner of my Death. I do &s;wear it, &s;aid the Regent, provided the Di&s;covery which you make &s;hall be found of due Im|port.</P>
<P>He then depo&s;ed that, on the Night, in which <HI>O&s;myn</HI> di&s;appeared, the Captain,
<PB N="201" REF="202">with ten confederated Ruffians, of whom he was one, enter'd the Prince's Cabin, and, having muffled the Faces of him and his Attendant, to prevent their crying out, bound them Hand and Foot and heaved them, through the Window, into a Boat that waited for them. That then, getting into the Frigate, they ma&s;&s;acred the &s;even <HI>Moors</HI> to who&s;e Care &s;he had been left, and rifling her of all the Money and Plate and Valuables that they could find, they got into their Boat, and, &s;inking the Frigate, with <HI>O&s;myn</HI> and his Attendant in her, they made Way, with Oar and Sail, to the neare&s;t Shore, where they divided their Plunder, and, &s;taving the Boat, made &s;eparately off to different Regions.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Barbar</HI> was &s;ent for, and came in Chains, and attended by Guards, into the Pre&s;ence. But, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the Face of the Convict, without waiting to be con|fronted by his Evidence, he ru&s;hed violent|ly, with his Head foremo&s;t, toward the oppo&s;ite Marble, and, if a Man, who was at Hand, had not caught him by the Chain, he would in&s;tantly have da&s;hed his Skull to Shivers.</P>
<P><HI>Ali,</HI> hereupon, without further Exami|nation, ordered the Head of the Convict to be &s;truck off in the Morning, and <HI>Bar|bar</HI> to be impaled in the Face of the People.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
Never was Joy like mine, on hearing this Sentence pronounced again&s;t <HI>Barbar;</HI> and I ro&s;e early the next Morning in order to have the Plea&s;ure of being at his Execu|tion.</P>
<P>He was &s;o enfeebled by his Panicks, that they were obliged to draw him on a Sled to the Stake; and the mu&s;cling of his Countenance had all the Impre&s;&s;ions of Death, De&s;pair and Hell repre&s;ented upon it.</P>
<P>This, however, did not affect me with any other Sen&s;ation than of that Delight which is naturally felt on the Gratification of Revenge, till the Executioners, with unfeeling Hearts and merry Tauntings, began to take the Wretch in Hand. But, when I &s;aw them, with Difficulty and great Violence, thru&s;ting the Stake through his Body, which they run up within&s;ide the &s;pinal Bone and &s;o out at the Back of his Neck, in order to avoid his Bowels and keep him the longer in Angui&s;h; when I &s;aw him writhing in Agony, and heared his horrible Roars and Groanings, all my Revenge was quickly turned into Terror and Compa&s;&s;ion; his Pangs and Sufferings, as it &s;eemed, were transferred to my own Per&s;on, and, had I not turned away, I &s;hould have fainted on the Spot.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
The Dey, from this time, became ex|tremely fond of me and familiar with me. He allotted me an affluent Pen&s;ion, with Slaves, Hor&s;es and Attendants. He &s;aid I &s;hould be to him in the Place of a Nephew and of a Son, and he called me by the Name of <HI>David-O&s;myn.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after, Tidings were brought that <HI>Caled Amurath</HI> of <HI>Fez</HI> was making mighty Preparations to invade his Domi|nions. We will more than meet him Half way, cried the gallant <HI>Ali;</HI> perhaps we may even prevent his threatened Expediti|on. He then &s;ummoned his Forces from all Quarters. I was pre&s;ent when he made a general Mu&s;ter of them. His Foot were more formidable for their Numbers than their Di&s;cipline; but his Hor&s;e were per|fectly trained, and made a mo&s;t brilliant Ap|pearance.</P>
<P>The Day before he &s;et out, I threw my|&s;elf at his Feet. I will go with you, my Ma&s;ter, I will go with you, I cried. I will not have any Command or Po&s;t of Pre|ference or Honour; I only de&s;ire Permi&s;&s;ion to fight by your Side, that you may witne&s;s how greatly I &s;hall dare in your Cau&s;e; how ready I &s;hall be to take, to my own Bo&s;om, all the Weapons that &s;hall be aimed at your Bo&s;om, my Father!</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="205">
No, <HI>David,</HI> he replied, my People know you are &s;till a Chri&s;tian. I could not re|frain from &s;hewing the Love I have for you; and that might be Matter of Jealou&s;y and Di&s;content to my Captains. I will leave you here a Band of Soldiers, with whom you are to encamp within Sight of my Palace, and to keep the&s;e Walls from Violence, and my Women from Pollution. But, while you are their Guardian, beware that you do not turn an Invader, <HI>David!</HI> I would pardon you any thing but this; I would not pardon you the Inva&s;ion of my Bed, <HI>David-O&s;myn!</HI> No, my Lord, I cried aloud, I cannot prove ungrateful. Though your Women were as obvious to my Walks as yonder Pavement, and though adorned with more Graces than their fir&s;t Mother in Paradi&s;e, they &s;hould have no Temp|tation for me, my Ma&s;ter!</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Ali</HI> began his March; and having e&s;corted him a Piece on his Way, I returned to my Charge.</P>
<P>That Night, as I lay in my Tent, I began to call my&s;elf to Account. <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid I to my Soul, thou ha&s;t now gotten Pre|ferment, and Riches, and Honours; thou art, as it were, the &s;econd Man in the Realm, and all this People have thee in high E&s;timation: But, art thou the better
<PB N="205" REF="206">or the happier Man for all this, <HI>David?</HI> Far otherwi&s;e, far otherwi&s;e. O frail and vain Heart! the&s;e Gauds and the&s;e Glories have taken hold upon thee, and they have drawn a painted Veil between me and my God. To my Chain, and my Straw, and my Nakedne&s;s, return me to them, O Lord! return me to my Slavery, return me to my Labours! I was not then, indeed, gaining Conque&s;ts and winning Prizes; but I was near to obtaining <HI>the Prize of the High Calling.</HI> My Body was not then adorn|ed with Gold and Pearl; but my Spirit rejoiced in <HI>the Pearl of mighty Price!</HI></P>
<P>In about five Weeks after, as I was taking, by Moonlight, my Evening's Walk of Meditation, on the Marble that chec|quered the Pavement before the Palace, <HI>Muley,</HI> an old Black, and Chief of the Eunuchs of the Seraglio, came up and acco&s;ted me. <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> &s;aid he, taking a Bundle from under his Arm, I have here a Pre&s;ent for you, that would make proud the greate&s;t Emperor upon Earth. It is a compleat Suit wrought, purpo&s;ely, for you by the Fingers of the Sultana, as al&s;o by the Fingers of her fair and princely Si&s;ters. They &s;aw your great Atchiev|ments during the Fe&s;tival, and they &s;end you this in Return for the Plea&s;ure which you gave them.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
So &s;aying, he unfolded the Robes to the Moon. They were flower'd with needled Gold, and inlaid with Pearl and Gems of &s;uch a vivid Lu&s;tre as reflected her Beams with tenfold Brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>And what is required of me, <HI>Muley,</HI> I demanded, in Return for this ine&s;timable Honour and Bounty? Nothing, &s;aid <HI>Muley,</HI> but a &s;ingle Hour's Attendance, to give them a &s;hort Sketch of your Life and Adven|tures. Take back your Pre&s;ents, I cried, there is Poi&s;on and Death in them; I will not betray the Tru&s;t that our Ma&s;ter has repo&s;ed in me. Nay, &s;aid <HI>Muley,</HI> I affirm to you that there is no &s;uch Intention. Our Ladies are all Women of the &s;evere&s;t Cha&s;tity. I will undertake to conduct and reconduct you back in &s;afety. Neither can our Ma&s;ter be betrayed in any Degree. They all live together, they love like Si&s;|ters, and no one keeps a Secret from the other. However, they de&s;ired me to tell you that, if you are of a fearful Temper, they will not in&s;i&s;t on the Favour &s;o much expected.</P>
<P>Here, I felt my&s;elf piqued: No, <HI>Muley,</HI> I cried, I am no Coward. I can dare all hone&s;t Dangers. I will attend you. But, I will not &s;tay, <HI>Muley.</HI> I will let your Ladies know, that, in the Cau&s;e of Honour and Virtue, I can re&s;i&s;t all Temptations.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
I then called a di&s;tant Slave, who wait|ed my Orders, and, giving him the Bun|dle, de&s;ired him to lay it within my Tent. Where now, <HI>Muley?</HI> &s;aid I. I will &s;hew you, &s;aid <HI>Muley.</HI></P>
<P>He then led me to a large Bucket, wherein Water was accu&s;tomed to be rai&s;|ed, by Pullies, to the Balcony, and there to be emptied into Ve&s;&s;els that &s;tood upon the Leads.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not enter any Door of the lower Story, &s;aid <HI>Muley;</HI> for there our Dome&s;tics inhabit, and might, probably, ob&s;erve you. But, if you get into this Bucket, in a Minute or two after, I will rai&s;e you by the Pullies, and take you gently in.</P>
<P><HI>Muley</HI> then went from me, and was ad|mitted, on &s;triking at a di&s;tant Door; while I &s;tood by the Bucket, and, ob&s;erv|ing its fir&s;t Motion, jumped in and was conveyed to the Top of the Palace.</P>
<P><HI>Muley</HI> there received me in Darkne&s;s and Silence, and, taking me by the Hand, led me down by a few Steps, into a nar|row Apartment that was &s;carcely enlighten|ed by a glimmering Lamp. He there left me again, giving me only a whi&s;pering
<PB N="208" REF="209">Promi&s;e that he would quickly return. I waited for him long, however, under great Impatience of getting &s;peedily back again. At length he came, and, taking me by the Hand, without &s;peaking a Word, he led me through a long and dark Entry, till, coming to a folding Door, he touched a Spring, whereupon the Door flew open on either Side, and threw a &s;ud|den Blaze upon my dazzled Eyes.</P>
<P>The Saloon, upon which it opened, was profu&s;ely illuminated, and mo&s;t &s;umptu|ou&s;ly furni&s;hed; but my Attention was quickly called from &s;uch inferior Objects. In the Mid&s;t, a Board was cover'd with an elegant Collation of little Matters. Around it were placed a great Number of &s;mall Sofas; and, behind each Sofa, &s;tood a Lady richly adorned, but veiled from the Head to the Wai&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Muley</HI> led me to the further End, while I made low Obey&s;ance as I pa&s;&s;ed the Company. He then compelled me to &s;it, where, by a &s;mall Turn of my Head, I could have a full Pro&s;pect of each Fair-one at Table. Then, as by one Motion, they were all in&s;tantly &s;eated; and again, as by one Motion, they all, in&s;tantly, threw up their Veils, and I had like to have fallen backward with the Suddenne&s;s of the Lu&s;tre that fla&s;hed upon my Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">
All the Ladies &s;miled, and &s;eemed de|lighted at my A&s;toni&s;hment. The Sultana <HI>Adelaide,</HI> &s;at neare&s;t to me, on the Right; and was no way di&s;tingui&s;hed from her Si&s;|ters, but by a &s;mall Coronet of feathered Diamonds that was in&s;erted in her lovely Locks. <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, you &s;eem &s;ome|thing &s;urprized; were you never in a Se|raglio before? Have you no Seraglios in your Country, <HI>O&s;myn?</HI> No, Madam, I re|plied, we have no Seraglio in our Country; but &s;ure, no Seraglio, upon Earth, ever produced &s;uch and &s;o many Beauties as now &s;trike my Eyes. Heaven, alone, can exhibit &s;uch a Con&s;tellation of Luminaries.</P>
<P>Would you not wi&s;h then, &s;aid <HI>Adelaide,</HI> to have &s;uch a Seraglio of your own? No, Madam, I an&s;wered; without Love, in my Judgment, there can be no true Enjoy|ment; if ever I love, it can be but the one Object, and her I &s;hall love with my whole Heart; true Love will admit of no Divi&s;i|on. Here, &s;he looked at me, with a Ten|derne&s;s that &s;unk into my Soul, and, tak|ing out her Handkerchief, &s;he wiped away a &s;welling Tear.</P>
<P>Another Lady then demanded if we had not a Woman Market, and if they were not Slaves in my Country as they were here? No, Madam, I replied, our Fair|ones
<PB N="210" REF="211">ones there, are not the Subjects of Mer|chandize, but the Objects of Admiration. No Woman in <HI>England</HI> can be bound to any Lover, &s;ave by her own Affections. There, it is Death for any Man to have more than one Wife, and that after a Suit, perhaps of &s;everal Years. A Lady there of equal Beauties to the lea&s;t excellent in Company, would be followed by Hundreds of humble and &s;ighing Adorers. In <HI>Eng|land,</HI> our Actions are as free as our Hearts; and the Sen&s;ibilities of mutual Love, be|tween tho&s;e of the Sexes, who feel the tender and enchanting Pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;titute the principal Happine&s;s of which Life is capable.</P>
<P>Happy Engli&s;hwomen, happy Engli&s;h|women! was echoed all around.</P>
<P>Alas, cried the lovely <HI>Adelaide,</HI> how very different is our Fate! we are &s;old, like &s;er|vile Brutes, to any Brute of a Ma&s;ter. We neither love nor are beloved; as you now have convinced me, <HI>O&s;myn.</HI> We are &s;ubjected to vile De&s;ires, which we at once dete&s;t and &s;uffer; and, when tho&s;e De&s;ires are gratified, we are ca&s;t away as common Lumber, to make Room for &s;ome new Comer. Even high as I &s;it here, the fa|vour'd Sultana of my Lord, I may To-mor|row be appointed to the meane&s;t Offices of his Hou&s;hold. This, &s;urely, cannot be a
<PB N="211" REF="212">Marriage; for, as you have intimated, <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> and as I feel in my own Soul, Marriage can only con&s;i&s;t in an Union of Hearts. Love cannot be bought or &s;old; it is of too precious a Nature; nothing can purcha&s;e, nothing compen&s;ate, &s;ave its Value in Love alone.</P>
<P>Here they pre&s;s'd me to tell them my Story; and here I confe&s;s, to my Shame, that, however vile I appeared in my own Eyes, I was ambitious of appearing as ho|nourable and de&s;erving as po&s;&s;ible in the Eyes of the fair <HI>Adelaide.</HI> I, therefore, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed what was black, glo&s;&s;ed over what was offen&s;ive, and enlarged on every thing that I deemed advantageous in my own Character.</P>
<P>The Night was far &s;pent, by the Time I concluded; and the Sultana, ari&s;ing, pro|po&s;ed to &s;hew me the Curio&s;ities of an adjoining Cabinet. I accordingly attended her, and was a&s;toni&s;hed at the Lu&s;tre, the Richne&s;s, and Profu&s;ion of the Jewels, as well as at the Miracles of Art that &s;he di&s;|played before my Eyes.</P>
<P>On our Return, we perceived that our Company had ab&s;conded. <HI>Adelaide</HI> grew all Crim&s;on, and ca&s;t down her Eyes. I, al&s;o, was confu&s;ed, my Heart began to
<PB N="212" REF="213">throb, and I looked about for &s;ome Pre|tence to make a quick E&s;cape. But&mdash;but&mdash;In &s;hort, Gentlemen, neither my Re&s;o|lutions, nor Religion, nor Honour, nor Gratitude were of any avail again&s;t &s;uch a Temptation; they fell together, an ea&s;y Victim to the all-conquering <HI>Adelaide.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adelaide</HI> was the fir&s;t to pre&s;s my Re|treat. It was not yet Day. I found <HI>Muley</HI> in Waiting. We came by the Way we went, I &s;tepped into the Bucket, and he let me gently down.</P>
<P>As I approached the Pavement, I felt a Hand, behind, that &s;eized me violently by the Shoulder. I &s;prung out, and, &s;eizing the Wretch by the Throat, would in&s;tant|ly have plunged my Poniard into his Bo|&s;om; but &s;ome Power as &s;uddenly arre&s;ted my Arm, and &s;aid to my Heart, beware that thou add not Murder to Adultery, <HI>David!</HI></P>
<P>While I he&s;itated, a Number ru&s;hed up|on me unaware, they griped me by each Arm, and, wre&s;ting the Poniard from me, they bound my Hands behind, and led me to the Cells of the <HI>Imams</HI> that &s;tood &s;ome|thing aloof from one End of the Palace.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had brought Lights, what, <HI>O&s;myn!</HI> exclaimed their Chief, can
<PB N="213" REF="214">this be our renowned <HI>O&s;myn?</HI> Is it thus that you repay the Favours of your gene|rous and kind Ma&s;ter? You are a Chri&s;ti|an, cried another; has your <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> then taught you to betray the Confidence and Tru&s;t that is repo&s;ed in you? This was a home Stab; it went through my Heart; but I &s;tood in a &s;hamefaced Sullenne&s;s, and opened not my Lips.</P>
<P>Here they went apart, and, having con|&s;ulted awhile, returned. <HI>O&s;myn,</HI> &s;aid their Chief, you are a brave and a wonderful Man, and it is a pity to lo&s;e you. Your Secret is yet with us; and, we &s;wear to you, by our holy Prophet, and by the ter|rible <HI>Alha,</HI> that if you perform the &s;ingle Condition we enjoin, we will bury what we know, in a Depth below the Grave, and we will recommend you to the Love of <HI>Ali,</HI> and the Acclamations of all the People, and we will have you loaded with Preferments, and Riches, and Honours. Name it quickly, I cried, whatever it may be, at the Ri&s;que, at the Lo&s;s of my Life, I will perform it. It is, &s;aid he, no more than to abjure <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to confe&s;s <HI>Ma|homet,</HI> who&s;e Prie&s;ts we are, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings of his Paradi&s;e &s;hall be &s;hower'd down upon you.</P>
<P>Here I gave a deep Groan; and ca&s;ting down my Head, and &s;hedding a &s;ilent
<PB N="214" REF="215">Tear, without daring to lift my Thoughts to Heaven; No, no, I cried, though <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is nothing to me, though I have no Inte|re&s;t in him; though he &s;purns and has re|jected me, for Time, and for Eternity; though I have daily denied him by every Action of my Life; yet my Tongue &s;hall never deny him. In Poverty and Naked|ne&s;s, in Dangers and in Dungeons, in Death here, and in Hell hereafter, my Mouth &s;hall confe&s;s him.</P>
<P>Here, they went apart again, and, re|turning, told me, that I &s;hould have two Days to deliberate on their Propo&s;al; but that, if I did not comply, I &s;hould be im|paled alive on the third Morning, with all the additional Tortures that Art could in|vent.</P>
<P>They then put me into a cover'd kind of a Waggon and conveyed me to &mdash;, where I was ca&s;t into a noi&s;ome Dungeon, bolted down to the Ground with Irons, &s;u&s;tained with coar&s;e Bread and Water, and not allowed a Ray of Light to divert my Thoughts from the Darkne&s;s and Horrors of my Situation.</P>
<P>Mean time, I endeavoured to reinforce my Re&s;olution, by repeating to my&s;elf the &s;acred Promi&s;e, where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ays, <HI>who&s;oe|ver will confe&s;s me upon Earth, him will I
<PB N="215" REF="216">confe&s;s before my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Mine, indeed, &s;aid I, is but a verbal Con|fe&s;&s;ion; but, even that, with what I am about to &s;uffer for his Sake, may &s;erve to make me le&s;s criminal, if not acceptable in his Sight.</P>
<P>I then longed to be brought to the Te&s;t, while I &s;huddered at the Thoughts of it. At length the Day arrived. The <HI>Imams</HI> came, and once more repeated the Que&s;ti|on; but I &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, though in Terms that were &s;carcely intelligible, for my Tongue cleaved, with Terror, to the Roof of my Mouth.</P>
<P>They then &s;tripped me to the&s;e Draw|ers, out of which, al&s;o, they took my Money with other Valuables, and every thing except this in&s;ignificant Walnut, and, having tied me to a Sled, I was dragged to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P>The chief <HI>Imam</HI> once more a&s;ked if I would renounce the Son of <HI>David?</HI> but I made him no An&s;wer, for I was unable to &s;peak. I had &s;een the Preparations; the Stake in the Hands of the Executioners; the Fires kindled about me, with horrid In&s;truments ready to be put therein, for the tearing of my frying and quivering Fle&s;h from the Bones.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217">
Could I then have had the Confidence to have turned my Soul to God, and to have be&s;ought his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in that trying and terrible Hour, I make no Que&s;tion but he would have given me Strength from on high, to defy all that Man or Devils could do unto me; and, I might now, in the Regions of his Bounty and his Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, have been pouring forth my Exi&s;tence, in the grateful and a&s;toni&s;h|ed Sen&s;e of his Mercy to &s;uch a Sinner.</P>
<P>But, when I reflected on the Wrythings of <HI>Barbar,</HI> the bare Sight of which my Spirit was not able to &s;upport; when I &s;aw &s;uch an Apparatus of additional Torments; and when they took me in Hand, for in|&s;tant Execution, I utterly lo&s;t my Sen&s;es; I &s;hrunk inward with Fear, my Hairs &s;tood on End with Horror; my Tongue found &s;udden Utterance, and, I cried, Stay, &s;tay, I will &s;ay, I will do whatever you enjoin.</P>
<P>The Imam then began to pronounce a Form of Renunciation, which he ordered me to repeat after him; but, I was &s;o panting and breathle&s;s, that they were obliged to get a Cordial for me to keep me from &s;wooning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Spirits were &s;omething re&s;tored, the Imam again began his impi|ous
<PB N="217" REF="218">Ceremony, and I make no Que&s;tion but I &s;hould have gone through it, howe|ver abhorrent to my Soul; but, in that In&s;tant, we hear'd di&s;tant Shouts and Cries, as of many People; the Sound of the Cla|mours drew nearer and nearer; and, &s;oon after, we &s;aw Numbers hurrying to and hurrying from the City. Their Words became, now, as di&s;tinct as they were au|dible; <HI>Ali</HI> is &s;lain. <HI>Ali</HI> is &s;lain! was all the Cry; and <HI>Amurath</HI> comes in full March up|on us.</P>
<P>Here, all turned &s;uddenly from me, and, flying &s;everal Ways, left me un|bound and alone, &s;itting clo&s;e by the Stake. Seeing this, I began to recover from the fearful and faint Condition in which I was; and, ri&s;ing, I made the be&s;t of my way to the Port. There I &s;aw a long Boat ju&s;t about to &s;et off with a Number of Fellows, much in my own Plight, and, taking a Run, I &s;prung from the Beach into the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>A Man then demanded, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> if I was one of the Ran&s;omed? Yes, ran&s;om|ed, ran&s;omed, I cried, wonderfully ran|&s;omed indeed; whereupon, without fur|ther Que&s;tion, they &s;et up their Sail, and, in about two Hours, we reached the Ship which the Con&s;ul had appointed to take them in.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="219">
For the Remainder of that Day, I con|tinued in a State that is hard to be con|ceived. My Head and Stomach, at times, were di&s;ordered by &s;ick Fits; and my Soul hovered in an a&s;toni&s;hed and fearful Kind of Doze; as one not rightly awaked from a Dream of Horror.</P>
<P>Toward Evening I threw my&s;elf down in the Hold, and &s;unk into a State of utter Oblivion, as I had not &s;lept for the three foregoing Nights and Days.</P>
<P>The Day following I found my Body &s;omething refre&s;hed, but the Situation of my Mind was like that of a di&s;turbed and tumbling Sea after a raging Storm. I looked around for Comfort, but no Com|fort was near; I looked afar off for Hope, but no Hope came in Pro&s;pect. The Sen&s;e of Exi&s;tence became a Mi&s;ery under which I was not able to bear up; and, could I have had my Wi&s;h, Creation would again have been uncreated.</P>
<P>During the Whole of our Voyage, I con|tinued, very nearly, in this Di&s;temper of Spirit. For, though, at Times, I would enter into the Frolics and jovial Humours of the Crew; yet my Merriment, at &s;uch Sea&s;ons, was a Merriment to Madne&s;s; and I would again &s;ink, precipitately, into
<PB N="219" REF="220">a Depth of De&s;pondence, who&s;e Darkne&s;s would admit no Ray of Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The Tempter would then urge me, by Dagger, or by Drowning, or by any Means, to get rid of a Being that only &s;erved to torment me: But again, the Dread that I might not get rid of that Being, and that Death might plunge me into a Perpetuity of tho&s;e Pangs in which I &s;aw the wretched <HI>Barbar</HI> agonizing, this deterred me from ha&s;tening the Day of my horrid Doom, and &s;o I waited in a gloomy and <HI>fearful looking out for Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I would then call my&s;elf, at Dead of Night, before that terrible Judgment. Thou Fiend <HI>David,</HI> I would &s;ay, where|fore art thou &s;unk in Guilt above all that ever were guilty? It was thy Fortune to get three good and kind Ma&s;ters, good and kind above thy Wants, and even up to thy Wi&s;hes; and all the&s;e thou ha&s;t de|ceived, thou ha&s;t &s;poiled and betrayed them. Even the Ma&s;ter of all Ma&s;ters, the Ma&s;ter who was my Freedom in the Mid&s;t of my Captivity, I was on the Brink of denying the <HI>Je&s;us</HI> al&s;o; nay, I did reject, I did deny him, I promi&s;ed, I engaged, to reject and deny him; and he will reject thee; through Time, and through Eterni|ty, he will deny thee, <HI>David!</HI></P>

One Evening a fearful Tempe&s;t aro&s;e; and, while mo&s;t of the Crew gave &s;ome of their little Matters to the Providore for Liquors, and &s;at, drowning the Sen&s;e of Danger, and profanely carou&s;ing, at one End of the Ship; my Companions, who are pre&s;ent, were praying or &s;inging Glory to God, in the other. Both Parties invit|ed me to join them, but I refu&s;ed to be Partaker with either; for I could not abet, in others, that Wickedne&s;s which I con|demned and dete&s;ted in my&s;elf; and I could not think of taking, into my execrable Mouth, the &s;acred Name of that <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to whom I had &s;o lately turned a fal&s;e Apo&s;|tate. In the mean time, I held my&s;elf as the Refugee <HI>Jonas,</HI> who&s;e Crimes had brought Perdition on all in the Ve&s;&s;el; and I was on the Point of advi&s;ing the Mari|ners to ca&s;t me out.</P>
<P>At length the Tempe&s;t abated, but my Perturbations did not abate. I wi&s;hed to repent, but I deemed my&s;elf pa&s;t the Po&s;&s;i|bility of Repentance; and thus I continued in a State of Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Enmity again&s;t my&s;elf, again&s;t my God, again&s;t Man, and Woman kind.</P>
<P>When the Con&s;tables entered, and, by the Order of Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> laid hold on &s;uch a Number of my late A&s;&s;ociates; though
<PB N="221" REF="222">I thought that I did not care what be|came of me, yet Nature began to re|a&s;&s;ert her Rights; I trembled and turned exceeding pale, as I &s;uppo&s;e; all my Crimes came ru&s;hing together into my Memory; I imagined that they were ex|po&s;ed before your Eyes al&s;o; and I ex|pected, each Moment, to be &s;eized, like my fellow Culprits, and thrown into a Dungeon. But, when I found that, in|&s;tead of Puni&s;hment, you propo&s;ed to load me with your Bounties; all my Sins ap|peared to me the more exceedingly &s;inful; your Goodne&s;s came, in a Heap, upon the Heap of my own Guilt; and I fell pro&s;trate at your Feet, as under the Weight of a Mountain.</P>
<P>AS SOON as he had clo&s;ed his Story; take Courage and Comfort to you, <HI>David,</HI> I cried. Your Ca&s;e is not near &s;o de&s;pe|rate as your con&s;cientious Fears have form|ed it. Your Error lay in tru&s;ting to your own Sen&s;e of Duty, and to the Strength of your own Powers for re&s;i&s;ting Tempta|tion; and, the be&s;t Man that ever breath|ed, with no better a Dependance, mu&s;t in|evitably have fallen, as you did, <HI>David.</HI> You now know your own Weakne&s;s; you are taught, by repeated Experience, that, in or of your&s;elf, you no more can &s;tand again&s;t the Enemies of your Soul, when they a&s;&s;ail you, than a Tree &s;evered from

Keep therefore to your Root, <HI>David.</HI> Never dare, in your own Strength, to oppo&s;e your&s;elf to a Reed. Apply to the Rock, my Friend, from whence you were hewn. Cling to him, repo&s;e upon him, put your whole Confidence in him; and then your Weakne&s;s &s;hall become &s;tronger than an Army with Banners; and neither Life nor Death, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things pre&s;ent, nor Things to come, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate you from the Love of God which is in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>While I &s;poke, his Eyes began to gli&s;ten, the Cloud of his Countenance cleared, his A&s;pect a&s;&s;umed a chearful Serenity, he could &s;carce have been known for the &s;ame Per&s;on; and he cried, I will, I will, once more &s;eek to my God; do you, my Ma&s;|ter, pray him to permit my Approach; and in Life, or in Death, I never will let go my Hold of him any more. He then would, again, have ca&s;t him&s;elf at my Feet, but I ha&s;tened to prevent him.</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> &s;aid I, I am going for <HI>France,</HI> and before I &s;et out, I &s;hould be greatly plea&s;ed to &s;ee you in &s;ome decent Way of Livelihood, Now, in&s;tead of the twenty Pounds, of which you held your&s;elf &s;o un|worthy,
<PB N="223" REF="224">here are two hundred to make a kind of Beginning for you, and I &s;hould be glad to know the U&s;e you propo&s;e to make of this Money.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, Sir, &s;aid he, I will refund, to my two Ma&s;ters, all the Money of which I defrauded them, with full or double Intere&s;t, amounting, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;eventy or eighty Pounds. And, in the next Place, I will return, to your Honour, every Penny of the Remainder; for indeed you &s;hall not per&s;uade me to tru&s;t my&s;elf with it. In my pre&s;ent Way of thinking, it would be of no more u&s;e to me than the Stones or Dirt of the Street. My State of Slavery and Labour was the only State of Happine&s;s that I have known &s;ince my Birth; and I dread, I &s;hudder at the Ap|prehen&s;ion of Affluence. I am already but too rich, in having my Liberty. I am now in a free Country, and, therefore, Lord of my own Earnings. Matter of Labour is but Matter of Play to me. The Pay of a Porter, on the Spot where I am, will be too much of Opulence; it will give me a further Sufficiency to &s;upply the Wants of the Needy, and the Cravings of the Beggar.</P>
<P>My good <HI>David,</HI> my beloved Penitent, &s;aid the worthy Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and &s;o &s;aying
<PB N="224" REF="225">he took him mo&s;t cordially by the Hand, how came you by that &s;ame Walnut, the only Remnant of all your Trea&s;ures, which you called in&s;ignificant, and have yet re|tained to this Day? You are as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to his chief Butler, Sir, &s;aid <HI>David,</HI> you bring my Faults fully into the Remembrance of your Servant.</P>
<P>While the Sultana, as I told you, was &s;hewing and di&s;playing to me the Trea|&s;ures of her Cabinet, &s;he de&s;ired me to take, thereout, whatever I held mo&s;t rare or mo&s;t e&s;timable. But, as my covetous Fit was not then upon me, I turned my Eye on a few Walnuts that I &s;aw in a Cor|ner, and, taking one of them, &s;aid, that I would keep it for her Sake. Swear to me then, &s;he cried, that you will never break or open it, till you get into your own Country. This was an ea&s;y Condition, and I in&s;tantly complied with it.</P>
<P>Did you love the Sultana, <HI>David?</HI> Yes, Sir, to exce&s;s, as I am al&s;o per&s;uaded that &s;he loved me; and we vowed to inter|marry, if ever it &s;hould be our Fortune to regain our Liberty; and, bound or free, never to marry another.</P>
<P>Let me look at your Walnut, <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> you are now under no fur|ther Injunction concerning it. Do not
<PB N="225" REF="226">break it, I be&s;eech you, then, Sir, &s;aid <HI>David,</HI> becau&s;e I intend never to part with it. I will not break it, <HI>David,</HI> I will only open it with my Knife, and a little Matter of I&s;ingla&s;s may &s;oon repair the Breach.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> then took the Walnut, and having poi&s;ed it, for &s;ome Time, in his Hand; I will give you a hundred Guineas, <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, for your Hazard of what this Shell contains. I would take a hun|dred Pence, Sir, &s;aid <HI>David,</HI> if I was inclin|ed to take your Money without giving Value. Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> then took his Knife, and, dividing the Shell with the utmo&s;t Caution, I have a &s;trong Fancy, <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, that I mu&s;t &s;oon rai&s;e the Market; and in&s;tantly produced a Diamond of the fir&s;t Water and Magnitude.</P>
<P>We all &s;tarted back and looked a&s;toni&s;h|ed; and <HI>David</HI> was the only Per&s;on in Company who, neither by Word or Look, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;malle&s;t Joy or Satisfaction on the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was a Jeweller, having in&s;pected the Stone awhile with much De|light and Admiration, Mr. <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, I would offer you &s;eventeen hundred Pieces for this Diamond, if I did not think my Offer con&s;iderably under the Value, but I
<PB N="226" REF="227">&s;hall be a better Judge when I have put it in the Scales. Keep it, keep it, Sir, cried <HI>David,</HI> and heartily welcome, return me only the Shell, it is all I will accept of. Then, turning to me a pale and alarmed A&s;pect, Ah! Sir, &s;aid he, this is que&s;tionle&s;s another Device of the Tempter, I fear that I am not to get quit of my old A&s;&s;ociate &s;o &s;oon as I looked for. I do not think with you, <HI>David,</HI> in this Matter, I replied. I rather conceive that Providence hath &s;ent you this Trea&s;ure at a Time that he &s;ees you will make a worthy U&s;e of it. Oh, Sir, he cried, if it &s;hall ever, again, be my Ca&s;e to fall off from my God, I &s;hall certainly run mad, or make away with my&s;elf. Why &s;o, <HI>David?</HI> &s;aid I. You mu&s;t not expect, all on a &s;udden, to jump into a &s;inle&s;s State. Such a State is only for tho&s;e who have already <HI>fought the good Fight,</HI> who have <HI>fini&s;hed their Cour&s;e,</HI> who have <HI>kept the Faith.</HI> Such a State is only for tho&s;e, in whom the Babe of <HI>Bethlehem</HI> is not only conceived, but grown up and become mature: The&s;e, indeed, cannot &s;in, but run, with a joyful and free Will, into all Sorts of Goodne&s;s, as a Stream is prone to run to its kindred and parent Ocean. But, as for &s;uch as you and I, Brother <HI>David,</HI> we mu&s;t be content to &s;truggle on, and to fall and ri&s;e by Turns. And, though we &s;hould fall an hundred times a Day, yea, and be &s;ore wounded
<PB N="227" REF="228">al&s;o, my <HI>David,</HI> yet we &s;hould not de|&s;pond, but turn as often to our Helper, in total Diffidence of our&s;elves, and full Con|fidence in his Mightine&s;s. For he is al|mighty to lift us up whenever he thinks good, and the Balm of <HI>Calvary</HI> is better than the Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> to heal all our woundings.</P>
<P>I will tell you another Secret, <HI>David,</HI> which I learned from a Saint who is now decea&s;ed. That the humbling State of frequent and con&s;cious Lap&s;es is more eli|gible, and tending to higher Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for Man, than the Firmne&s;s and Rectitude of an unfallen Angel, becau&s;e it &s;aps Self-confidence and creaturely Dependance, and throws one wholly on the Ba&s;e that pillars up Eternity.</P>
<P>Here he catched at my Hand, and pre&s;|&s;ing his Lips upon it, what &s;hall I render you, my Ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I render you, he cried, for the Peace and Comfort which you have &s;hed abroad through my Bo&s;om? I may now draw near to the Throne of Compa&s;&s;ion, heavy laden with all my Sins, that is to &s;ay, with all my&s;elf; and I will tru&s;t to free Mercy for removing the Bur|den, and to free Grace alone for any good that &s;hall ever be in me.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="229">
As it now grew late, we agreed that Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> &s;hould take <HI>David</HI> home in his own Coach, and that I &s;hould take <HI>Thomas</HI> with me in a Hackney; and I gave their remaining Comrades an Order for a hun|dred and fifty Guineas <HI>per</HI> Man.</P>
<P>When we were ju&s;t upon &s;eparating, <HI>Thomas</HI> caught <HI>David</HI> about the Neck. O my dear <HI>David,</HI> &s;aid he, I &s;hall &s;urely never dare to judge any Man again; for I held you to be a very Reprobate, when you were, fifty times over, a better Man than my&s;elf. Hereupon I wi&s;hed Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>David</HI> a good Night, and, making <HI>Tirlah</HI> and <HI>Thomas</HI> go into the Coach before me, my two Servants light|ed us Home with, each, a Torch in his Hand.</P>
<P>As I entered the Hou&s;e, Mrs. <HI>Tirrel</HI> met me with a &s;udden Joy in her Counte|nance. My dear Sir, &s;he cried, I began to be in Trouble about you; I have kept Supper back this long Time. Then, &s;aid I, let us have it as &s;oon as you plea&s;e; for I have here brought a dear Friend home with me.</P>
<P>I placed the Twins directly oppo&s;ite to each other at Table, and I made <HI>Tirlah</HI> and young <HI>James</HI> &s;it down along with us.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">
While I was plea&s;ingly employed in ob|&s;erving the mutual Emotions of the Bro|ther and Si&s;ter; they looked eagerly at each other, they both changed Counte|nance, and neither of them offer'd to ta&s;te a Bit. Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> &s;aid I, why don't you eat? <HI>Thomas! Thomas!</HI> cried the Si&s;ter, in a quick and pa&s;&s;ionate Accent; it may be&mdash;it may be&mdash;O!&mdash;my Brother!</P>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he gave a Jump which, for the World, &s;he could not have done at any other Time. Over tumbled the Ta|ble, Meat, Di&s;hes, and Plates; while &s;he catched and clung about her Brother, with|out ca&s;ting a Thought away upon the Ruins that &s;he had wrought. O my <HI>Tommy,</HI> O my <HI>Nelly!</HI> my <HI>Tommy,</HI> my <HI>Nelly!</HI> was all that was uttered in the Mid&s;t of their Care&s;&s;es. They &s;aw no one but each other; they heard no one but each other; and I would gladly lo&s;e or give a thou&s;and Suppers, to be fea&s;ted as I was at that Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> came to this Part of his Story, a Me&s;&s;enger entered in fearful Ha&s;te, and delivered a Letter to Lady <HI>Maitland.</HI> As &s;oon as &s;he had run it over, my deare&s;t Sir, &s;he cried, I mu&s;t leave you this In&s;tant. I lately made you an
<PB N="230" REF="231">Offer of a hundred thou&s;and Pounds, and now I know not that I have &s;o many Shil|lings upon Earth. I am here informed that the Tru&s;tee of all my Affairs has ab&s;conded and made his E&s;cape to <HI>France;</HI> but I mu&s;t hurry to Town, and enquire into this Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. So &s;aying, &s;he courte&s;ied and &s;udden|ly withdrew, without giving her Cou&s;in Time to make a Tender of his Services.</P>
<P>The next Morning, Mr. <HI>Clinton</HI> order'd his Chariot to the Door, and ha&s;ten'd to attend her Lady&s;hip at her Hou&s;e in <HI>London;</HI> but, there he was told that &s;he had &s;et out for <HI>Dover</HI> about an Hour before, and he returned, much dejected and grieved on her Account.</P>
<P>In about three Weeks after, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> with his young Pupil, came home, quite lightened of the Money they had taken abroad. Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> for &s;o we &s;hall call him again, gave <HI>Clement</HI> a friendly Embrace, and took <HI>Harry</HI> to his Care&s;&s;es as though he had returned from a long and dangerous Voyage.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Clement,</HI> &s;aid Mr, <HI>Fenton,</HI> what Ac|count have you to give us of your Expe|dition? An Account, Sir, that would be extremely di&s;plea&s;ing to any Man living ex|cept your&s;elf, in &s;hort our young Gentle|man, here, has plunged you above a thou|&s;and
<PB N="231" REF="232">Pounds in Debt, over the large Sums that we carried with us. I hope the Objects were worthy, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> wonderfully worthy, indeed, Sir; I never &s;aw &s;uch ten|der and affecting Scenes. Then I &s;hall be overpaid and enriched by the Narration.</P>
<P>Here, <HI>Harry</HI> enquired impatiently for Mrs. <HI>Clement</HI> and his Friend <HI>Ned,</HI> and be|ing told that they were on a Vi&s;it to the Widow <HI>Neighbourly,</HI> he took a ha&s;ty Leave for the pre&s;ent, and away he flew to em|brace them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> I cannot think that there is, in the World, &s;uch another Boy as yours. I will leave to him&s;elf the Detail of our Adven|tures in the &s;everal Pri&s;ons; they had &s;uch an Effect on his Heart, that they cannot but have made a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on his Memory; &s;o I &s;hall only tell you of what happened in our Way to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As we were chatting and walking lei&s;ure|ly along the Road, a poor Man before us happen'd to drop in a Fit of the Falling-&s;ick|ne&s;s. When <HI>Harry</HI> &s;aw the Writhings and Convul&s;ions in which he lay, he turned pale and looked va&s;tly frightened, and, &s;eizing me under the Arm, he cried, come, come away! and hurried me off as fa&s;t as he could. But we had not gone far, till
<PB N="232" REF="233">his Pace began to abate, and &s;topping, and he&s;itating, let us turn, let us turn, Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> he cried, let us go back again and help the poor Man! We then returned ha&s;tily, and, rai&s;ing his Head, we kept him from brui&s;ing it again&s;t the Ground. I then forced open his clenched Hands, and, having chafed the Palms awhile, he began to recover, and &s;oon came to him&s;elf. Meanwhile <HI>Harry</HI>'s Fright was not yet quite over. He &s;eemed willing to get away from the Object of his Terror, and, putting his Hand in his Pocket, and giving him all the Silver he had, he wi&s;hed him better Health, and away we went.</P>
<P>We had not gone above Half a Mile further, when I &s;aw a little Girl, in a Field on the right Hand, endeavouring to drive a Cow through a &s;mall Gate into the Road, in Order to be milked, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by her Mother; but the Cow kicked up her Heels and proved wanton and refractory, and ran hither and thither, and would not be guided. The poor Child then &s;et up a Cry of as bitter Di&s;tre&s;s, as if all that was valuable in the World was going to ruin. <HI>Harry</HI> gave a ready Ear to the Sound of Lamentation, and &s;eeing the Plight that the poor Thing was in, he &s;uddenly cro&s;&s;ed the Road, above Ankle deep in Dirt, and, leaping the Ditch, he proved nimbler than the Cow, and, driving her through
<PB N="233" REF="234">the Pa&s;s, he turned her into the Way that the Child would have her go.</P>
<P>That Morning, indeed, was to <HI>Harry</HI> a Morning of petty Adventures. By the time that we approached the Suburbs, we had nearly overtaken a grown Girl who car|ried a Ba&s;ket of Eggs on her Head. A great lubberly Boy, ju&s;t then, pa&s;&s;ed us by at a &s;mart Pace, and, tripping up to the Girl, gave the Ba&s;ket a Tip with his Hand, and da&s;hed all the Eggs into Ma&s;h again&s;t a &s;toney Part of the Road, and, again taking to his Heels, run on as before. Immediatly <HI>Harry</HI>'s Indignation was kind|led, and, &s;etting out at top Speed, he &s;oon overtook him, and gave him &s;everal &s;mart Strokes with his little Cane, acro&s;s the Shoulders. The Fellow then turned upon <HI>Harry</HI> and gave him a furious Blow with his Fi&s;t over the Head, while I ha&s;ten'd to his Relief, as I perceived that the other was quite an Overmatch for him. But, before I arrived, our Hero had put a quick End to the Combat, for, &s;pringing from the Ground, he darted his Head full into the No&s;e and Mouth of his Adver&s;ary, who in&s;tantly roared out, and, &s;eeing his own Blood come pouring down, he once more took to Flight, while <HI>Harry</HI> continued to pre&s;s upon him, and belaboured him at Plea&s;ure, till he judged that he had beaten him to the full Value of the Eggs.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
Meanwhile the poor Girl, wholly un|mindful of what pa&s;&s;ed, remained wailing and wringing her Hands over the Wreck of her Merchandi&s;e. The Voice of a Syren could not &s;o powerfully have attracted and recalled <HI>Harry</HI> from the Length he had gone; he returned with Speed to her, and I fol|lowed. My poor Girl, &s;ays he, where were you going with tho&s;e Eggs? To Market, Ma&s;ter, &s;ays &s;he: And what did you ex|pect to get for them? About five Shillings, Sir, and I had promi&s;ed my Daddy and Mammy to lay it out in Shoes and Stock|ings for my little Brothers and Si&s;ters; and &s;o, I mu&s;t now hear all the Blame of the poor Things going barefoot. Here, &s;he again &s;et up her Wailings, and her Tears poured down afre&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> then de&s;ired me to lend him ten Shillings, and turning to the Mourner, hold out your two Hands, my poor Girl, he cried. Then, putting five Shillings into each Hand, here is the Payment for your Eggs, &s;aid he; and here are five Shillings more, though I fear it is too little, to pay you for all the Tears they co&s;t you.</P>
<P>Never did I &s;ee &s;o &s;udden, &s;o great a Change in any Countenance. Surprize, Gratitude, Ec&s;ta&s;y fla&s;hed from her Eyes, and gave a joyous Flu&s;h to the mu&s;cling
<PB N="235" REF="236">of her A&s;pect. She hurried her Money into her Bo&s;om, and dropping on her Knees in the Dirt, and &s;eizing hold of <HI>Harry</HI>'s Hand, &s;he &s;queezed and ki&s;&s;ed it repeated|ly, without being able to utter a Word. While <HI>Harry</HI>'s Eyes began to fill, and, en|deavouring to di&s;engage him&s;elf, he made off as fa&s;t as he could, from &s;uch Thanks as he thought he had no Way de&s;erved.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was the la&s;t of our Adventures going to <HI>London.</HI> But, had you &s;een us, on our Return, about two Hours ago, you would have wonder'd at the mirey Plight into which we were put, by helping Pa&s;|fengers up with their Bundles, that had tumbled into the Dirt; or by a&s;&s;i&s;ting to rai&s;e Cattle that had fallen under their Car|riages; for Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry</HI> would compell me to be as bu&s;y and active, in Matters of Charity, as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, Sir, I am to tell you, that Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> with all his Excellencies of Per&s;on, Heart, and Under&s;tanding, will be accounted a mere Ideot, among People of Di&s;tinction, if he is not permitted to enter into &s;ome of the fa&s;hionable Foibles and fa&s;hionable Vices of the Age.</P>
<P>We were taking a Walk in the Mall, when we were met by the Earl of <HI>Man&s;|field,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ed great Joy at &s;eeing
<PB N="236" REF="237">Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> his old Acquaintance, as he called him, and he pre&s;&s;ed us &s;o earne&s;tly to Dinner that we could not, in Manners, refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>There was a va&s;t Concour&s;e of Com|pany, more e&s;pecially of the little Quality of both Sexes, who came to pay their Re&s;pects to young Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> and his Si&s;ter the Lady <HI>Loui&s;a.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harry</HI> was received and &s;aluted by Lady <HI>Mansfield</HI> and the young Lord, without any Appearance of the old Animo&s;ity. Some time after Dinner, a large Pacquet of Letters was brought into the Earl, and, making his Excu&s;e to <HI>Harry</HI> alone, he ro&s;e from the Table and retired to his Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> and his Si&s;ter then led the young Males and Females to an adjoining Apartment, where &s;everal Card-tables were laid; and I began to tremble for the Credit of my Pupil, on the Occa&s;ion, as I knew him to be a Novice in &s;uch Matters.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the remaining Ladies and Gentlemen divided into two or three Parties at Ombre; and I &s;aunter'd about the Room, admiring the Prints of the <HI>Ariadne,</HI> and the <HI>Aurora</HI> that were taken from <HI>Guido,</HI> as al&s;o &s;ome capital Paintings that the Earl had brought from <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
I had &s;pent above an Hour in this plea&s;ing Amu&s;ement, and had nearly made the Tour of the whole Dining-Room; when, as I &s;tood, at a little Di&s;tance behind my Lady's Chair, &s;eemingly inattentive to any thing that pa&s;&s;ed, Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> enter'd on Tiptoe, and, tripping up to his Mother and tittering and whi&s;pering in her Ear; what do you think, Mamma, &s;aid he; &s;ure, Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton</HI> is a Fool, a downright Fool, upon my Honour. He does not know a &s;ingle Card in the whole Pack, he does not know the Difference between the Ace of Hearts and the Nine of Clubs. I don't think either that he knows any thing of the Difference or Value of Coin; for, as we pa&s;&s;ed through the Hall to Day, a Beggar a&s;ked for a Halfpenny, and I &s;aw him &s;lip a Shilling into his Hand. Indeed, Mamma, he is the greate&s;t Fool that ever I knew; and yet, poor Fellow, he does not &s;eem to know any thing of the Matter him&s;elf.</P>
<P>During this Oration of Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> on the Virtues of his new Friend, I felt my whole Body glow and tingle with Concern; and, &s;oon after, <HI>Harry</HI> enter'd with the re&s;t of the &s;mall Quality. Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> cries my Lady, I beg to &s;peak with you. Don't you know the Cards, my Dear? No, in|deed, Madam. Can't you play at Dice? No, Madam. Can you play Draughts, or
<PB N="238" REF="239">Poli&s;h, or Che&s;s? Not at all, Madam. Why then, my Dear, I mu&s;t tell you, that all your Father's Fortune will never intro|duce you among People of any Breeding or of any Fa&s;hion. Can you play at no Kind of Game, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry?</HI> A little at Fox and Gee&s;e, Madam: And pray, my Dear, &s;aid my Lady &s;miling, which of the Parties do you e&s;pou&s;e? The Part of the Gee&s;e, Madam. I thought as much, pertly cried out my Lord <HI>Bottom,</HI> whereupon a loud Laugh was echoed through the Room.</P>
<P>Here, my Lady chid the Company, and calling <HI>Harry</HI> to her again, for he had gone &s;omething aloof, Tell me, I pray you, &s;aid &s;he, why you e&s;pou&s;e the Part of the Gee&s;e? Becau&s;e, Madam, I always wi&s;h that Simplicity &s;hould get the better of Fraud and Cunning.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s here looked a&s;toni&s;hed, and having gazed awhile at him, and caught and ki&s;&s;ed him eagerly; You are a noble Fellow, &s;he cried, and all mu&s;t be Fools or mad that ever &s;hall take you for the one or the other.</P>
<P>The elder Gentry, here, laid their Cards a&s;ide, and de&s;ired the young Ones to &s;et about &s;ome Play. Lady <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> propo&s;ed Draw-Gloves, or Que&s;tions and Commands, and to it they went.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="240">
Among the Females was one Mi&s;s <HI>Up|pi&s;h,</HI> &s;ole Heire&s;s to a va&s;t Fortune. Though her Per&s;on was deformed, her Face was the very Picture of confident Di&s;dain; and &s;carce any one could &s;peak to her, or look at her, without being told of the Contempt &s;he had for them, by the Side-Glance of her Eye, the Writhing of her Neck, and to&s;&s;ing up of her Head.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of the Play, our <HI>Harry</HI> was commanded to put the Candle into the Hand of Mi&s;s <HI>Uppi&s;h,</HI> and then to ki&s;s the Candle&s;tick, which Command he obeyed literally, by giving her the Candle and ki&s;&s;ing the Candle&s;tick which he held in his own Hand.</P>
<P>Hereupon, a great Shout was &s;et up in the young A&s;&s;embly, and, O the Fool, the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Creature, the Fool, the Fool, the Fool, was repeated throughout; while Lord <HI>Bottom</HI> laughed, and danced about in the Impatience of his Joy.</P>
<P>I was amazed that <HI>Harry</HI>'s Countenance &s;eemed no Way di&s;concerted by all this Ridicule. At length Lady <HI>Mansfield</HI> called him to her. How, my Dear, could you be guilty of &s;uch an Error, &s;he &s;aid; did not you know that, when you gave the Candle into the Hand of the young Lady,
<PB N="240" REF="241">&s;he became the Candle&s;tick, and it was her you &s;hould have ki&s;&s;ed. <HI>Harry</HI> then ap|proached to her Lady&s;hip's Ear, and, in a pretty loud Whi&s;per, &s;aid, I did not like the Metal, Madam, that the Candle&s;tick was made of. Again Lady <HI>Mansfield</HI> looked &s;urprized, and &s;aid, you are a &s;ly Rogue, a very &s;ly Rogue, upon my Honour, and have Sen&s;e enough to dupe the wi&s;e&s;t of us all.</P>
<P><HI>Jemmy Bottom,</HI> cried my Lady aloud, come here! I can't but tell you, <HI>Jemmy,</HI> that you have behaved your&s;elf extremely ill to your young Friend here, who might have improved you by his Example as much as he has honour'd you by his Vi&s;it. I mu&s;t further tell you, <HI>Jemmy Bottom,</HI> that, whenever you pique your&s;elf on degrading Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> you only pride in your own Aba&s;ement, and glory in your Shame. Hereupon, I got up and, leaving our Compliments for the Earl, I carried off my young Charge, for fear of our falling into any further Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>While <HI>Harry</HI> is abroad, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> be plea&s;ed to give me a general Sketch of the Manner in which you di&s;po&s;ed of your Money. In the fir&s;t Place, Sir, an&s;wered <HI>Clement,</HI> you will find, by this Li&s;t, that, for little more than the five hundred Pounds allotted, we relea&s;ed ninety five Pri&s;oners,
<PB N="241" REF="242">who&s;e Debts amounted from forty Shillings to about twelve Pounds <HI>per</HI> Man. The&s;e, in the general, had been Journeymen Tay|lors or Weavers, or Profe&s;&s;ors of other in|ferior Crafts; and, as they wanted Means or Encouragement for exerci&s;ing their re|&s;pective Occupations in Gaol, they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on the Pence which they got by begging at the Grates, or on their Dividends of oc|ca&s;ional Sums, which were &s;ent for their Relief by charitable Individuals. Nearly all of them were thin in Fle&s;h, and ex|tremely &s;habby in Clothing, and yet they could hardly be &s;aid to excite Compa&s;&s;ion, as they appeared &s;o chearful, and unfeeling of their own Wretchedne&s;s. Neither was there one of them, that I could learn, a &s;in|gle Circum&s;tance of who&s;e Story was worth reciting.</P>
<P>Some, however, were of a Quality much &s;uperior to this Cla&s;s. Among others, there was a <HI>French</HI> Marquis and a <HI>German</HI> Prince; the Prince had been put under Arre&s;t by his Caterer, and the Marquis by his Taylor; &s;o that, &s;omething le&s;s than fifty Pounds &s;et them both at Liberty.</P>
<P>While the Keeper of the Fleet Pri&s;on was making out a Li&s;t, for us, of the prin|cipal Debtors, <HI>Harry</HI> and I took a Turn about the Court, and ob&s;erved two Fel|lows, in Liveries, bearing &s;everal &s;moaking
<PB N="242" REF="243">Covers, up the Stone Stairs, to a front Din|ing-room. This &s;urprized me, and gave me the Curio&s;ity to enquire what Pri&s;oner it could be who lived in &s;o expen&s;ive and &s;uperb a Manner. Sir, &s;aid the under Keeper, there are few Men, now at Liber|ty, near &s;o wealthy as this Gentleman, who has done us the Honour to &s;et up his Staff of Re&s;t in our Hou&s;e. His Name is <HI>Sink.</HI> He is an Attorney and an old Bachelor, turned of &s;ixty Years of Age. He is in for &s;everal Sums, amounting to upward of nine thou&s;and Pounds, and he is reputed to be worth above double that Money.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t twenty Years, he be|haved him&s;elf with the &s;tricte&s;t Probity toward all Men, and with the &s;tricte&s;t Ap|pearance of Piety toward God. In the dark, in Fro&s;t and Snow and all Inclemen|cies of Weather, he never mi&s;&s;ed attending Morning Service at Church. He was equally &s;olicitous to be at Evening Prayer; and, whatever Company he chanced to have with him, or, how important &s;o|ever the Bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was engaged, the Moment he hear'd the Bell ring, he would huddle up his Papers and break away without Ceremony. He was eager in his Enquiries to know where the Sacrament was &s;oone&s;t to be admini&s;tered, and he never mi&s;&s;ed Receiving at lea&s;t once in the Week. Whenever he hear'd any Pro|fanene&s;s
<PB N="243" REF="244">or Ob&s;cenity in the Streets, he would &s;top to reprove and expo&s;tulate with the Offender. In &s;hort, he &s;o perfectly counterfeited or took off, as they call it, the real Chri&s;tian, that many looked to &s;ee him, like <HI>Enoch</HI> or <HI>Elijah,</HI> taken alive into Heaven.</P>
<P>This perpetual Parade of Sanctity gave him &s;uch an Eclat and unmea&s;urable Cre|dit, that he was left Tru&s;tee and Executor in a Multitude of Wills; and Numbers al&s;o depo&s;ited their Sub&s;tance in his Hands, in order to be laid out at Intere&s;t on Securi|ties, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>Three Months &s;ince, about the Dawn|ing, as his Butcher happen'd to pa&s;s by his Door, he hear'd it open, and turning, &s;aw a Number of Porters come out heavy laden. This gave him a Kind of Su&s;picion. He let them all pa&s;s, and, walking &s;oftly after, he &s;tepped up to the hindmo&s;t and offered him Half a Crown, on Condition of his telling him where they were carrying tho&s;e Parcels. That I will, &s;aid the Porter, for the Secret, if &s;uch it is, is nothing to me you know. In &s;hort we are carrying them to the Wharf to be put on board a Boat that waits to take them in.</P>
<P>The Butcher &s;aid no more, but hurried away to the Baker, and, as they both run
<PB N="244" REF="245">to the Office, they met the Brewer by the Way. They took out their re&s;pective Actions, and, taking a Con&s;table with them, they &s;eized on good Mr. <HI>Sink,</HI> as he was &s;tepping into a Coach and Six to make the be&s;t of his Way to <HI>Dover.</HI> He would have paid them their Money and di&s;charged their Actions on the Spot; but here the Ma&s;ter, in whom he tru&s;ted, happened to leave him in the lurch. As he had turned all his Effects into Money, and his Money into Paper, he had not at Hand wherewith to pay his in&s;tant Creditors. So they hurried him to Gaol, and, before the Banks were open, the Matter was blown, and Action after Action came pouring fa&s;t upon him.</P>
<P>When he found him&s;elf thus at Bay, he ca&s;t a&s;ide his Di&s;gui&s;e and &s;et them all at Defiance. His Creditors have &s;ince offered to accept ten Shillings, and &s;ome of them to accept five Shillings in the Pound; but he &s;wears that he will never pay them a Groat; for he is now as liberal of his Oaths and impious Execrations, as he was lately of his more impious Profanation of Go&s;pel Phra&s;es. And thus he daily revels in the &s;en&s;ual Con&s;umption of tho&s;e Wretches whom he hath &s;o inhumanly defrauded, while Hundreds of Orphans and Widows, and other Mi&s;erables peri&s;h for want of
<PB N="245" REF="246">the Su&s;tenance, which one infernal Appe|tite devours without Remor&s;e. Nay, &s;e|veral of his Creditors are, at this very time, fami&s;hing in this Pri&s;on, while they &s;ee him fea&s;ting &s;o lavi&s;hly upon their Spoils.</P>
<P>The Gorge of my Soul, cried Mr. <HI>Fen|ton,</HI> the very Gorge of my Soul ri&s;es a|gain&s;t this <HI>Daemon.</HI> Can nothing be done to bring him to Puni&s;hment? Our Parlia|ment will &s;urely interfere in &s;uch a calling Exigence; they will &s;end to the &s;everal Banks, and take up all the Depo&s;its that have been made in his Name. Alas, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Clement,</HI> he was already aware of &s;uch Po&s;&s;ibilities, and has enter'd all his Lodg|ments in feigned Names, and to Bearer upon Demand.</P>
<P>Indeed, continued <HI>Clement,</HI> I heartily wi&s;hed, at the time, that the Laws of the <HI>Grecians</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> had been in Force among us, where the Debtor was given up to be &s;et to Labour, whipped or tortured at the Plea&s;ure of the Creditor.</P>
<P>God forbid, God forbid, exclaimed Mr. <HI>Fenton.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;ee Mankind divided into the <HI>Rich</HI> and the <HI>Poor,</HI> the <HI>Strong</HI> and the <HI>Weak,</HI> the <HI>Sound</HI> and the <HI>Sickly,</HI> we are
<PB N="246" REF="247">apt to imagine, that <HI>Health, Strength,</HI> or <HI>Opulence,</HI> was given to Tho&s;e; and <HI>Infirmi|ty, Want,</HI> or <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> appointed to The&s;e, as Marks of the peculiar Favour or Di&s;|favour of Providence.</P>
<P>GOD, however, knows that there is nothing permanently good, or evil, in any of the&s;e Things. He &s;ees that nothing is a Good but Virtue, and that nothing is a Virtue, &s;ave &s;ome Quality of Benevo|lence. On Benevolence, therefore, he builds the Happine&s;s of all his intelligent Creatures; and, in this our mortal State, (our &s;hort Apparatus for a long Futurity) He has ordained the relative Differences of <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor, Strong</HI> and <HI>Weak, Sound</HI> and <HI>Sickly,</HI> &amp;c. to exerci&s;e us in the Offices of that Charity, and tho&s;e Affections, which, reflecting and reflected like mutual Light and Warmth, can alone make our Good to all Eternity.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE produces and con&s;ti|tutes the Heaven, or Beatitude of GOD him&s;elf: He is no other than an infinite and eternal GOOD WILL: Benevolence mu&s;t, therefore, con&s;titute the Beatitude or Heaven of all dependent Beings, how|ever infinitely diver&s;ified through &s;everal Departments and Subordinations, agree|able to the &s;everal Natures and Capacities of Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="248">
GOD has appointed human <HI>Power</HI> and human <HI>Wealth,</HI> as a ready and &s;ufficient Fund for human <HI>Want</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s;</HI> to which Fund, therefore, they have as good a Right to re&s;ort, as any other Creditors have to re&s;pective Tru&s;t or Depo&s;its; for, though Poverty and Weakne&s;s are not Creditors, by the Laws of Man, they are Creditors by the eternal Laws of Nature and Equity; and mu&s;t, here, or hereafter, bring their Debtors to account.</P>
<P>Every Man, when he becomes a Member of this or that Society, makes a Depo&s;it of three &s;everal Sorts of Tru&s;ts, That of his LIFE, that of his LIBERTY, and that of his PROPERTY.</P>
<P>Now as every Man, in his &s;eparate or independent State, has by Nature the ab&s;o|lute Di&s;po&s;al of his Property, he can con|vey the Di&s;po&s;al thereof, to Society, as amply and ab&s;olutely as he was, in his &s;eparate Right, entitled thereto.</P>
<P>This, however, cannot be &s;aid of his Life, or of his Liberty. He has no Man|ner of Right to take away his own Life; neither to depart from his own Li|berty: He cannot therefore convey to o|thers, a Right and Authority which he hath not in him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">
The Que&s;tion then occurs, by what Right it is, that the Legi&s;lative and exe|cutive Powers of Community, appoint &s;ome Per&s;ons to Death, and others to Im|pri&s;onment? My An&s;wer is &s;hort, and fol|lows:</P>
<P>It is the Right, perhaps the Duty, of every Man, to defend his Life, Liberty, and Property, and to kill or bind the At|tempters. This Right he can, therefore, convey; and, on &s;uch Conveyance, it be|comes the Right and Duty of the Tru&s;tees of Society, to put to Death, or impri&s;on all who take away, or attempt the Life, Liberty, or Property of any of its Mem|bers.</P>
<P>This Right, however, extends to <HI>Cri|minal Matters,</HI> only; and it does not, yet appear to me, upon what Rea&s;on, or right Rule, founded in Nature or Policy, the &s;everal Societies of Mankind have agreed to deliver up their Members, to Slavery, to Stripes, Tortures, or Impri&s;onment, for Matters <HI>merely Civil,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Debts.</HI></P>
<P>Several of the States of <HI>Greece,</HI> though accounting the re&s;t of the World as Barbarians; and even the <HI>Roman Repub|lic,</HI> during the Times of its mo&s;t boa&s;ted Policy and Freedom, gave up In&s;olvent
<PB N="249" REF="250">Debtors (without enquiring into the Cau&s;es or Occa&s;ions of &s;uch In&s;olvency) as Slaves, or ab&s;olute Property, into the Hands of their Creditors, to be &s;old at Will, or put to Labour, or &s;tarved, ma|cerated or tortured, in order to give Value, in Vengeance, which they could not give in Coin, or other equivalent Commodi|ties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, though al|lowing &s;ufficiently, as <HI>CHRIST</HI> &s;ays, for <HI>the Hardne&s;s of that People's Hearts,</HI> yet gave perfect Enlargement to all <HI>Jews</HI> who were Bondmen, and perfect Remi&s;&s;ion to all <HI>Jews</HI> who were per&s;onal Debtors, on every &s;eventh or &s;abbatical Year: And on every &s;eventh &s;abbatical Year, or Ju|bilee, all Pri&s;ons were thrown open; all Slaves, though Foreigners or Aliens, &s;et at Liberty; and even the Lands were en|franchi&s;ed, however mortgaged, or labour|ing under Debt and Execution; that all Things, animate or inanimate, might have an Earne&s;t of that Immunity, and perfect Freedom, which God originally intended, and keeps in Store for his Creatures.</P>
<P>The Laws of <HI>Egypt</HI> permitted no Mem|ber to deprive the Public of the Life, Li|berty, or Labour, of any other Member, except he were a Criminal, not fitting to live, or to be &s;uffered to walk at large. In
<PB N="250" REF="251">all Ca&s;es of Debtor and Creditor, they equitably appointed Value for Value, as far as the Sub&s;tance of the Debtor could reach; and, in Ca&s;e of In&s;ufficiency, the in&s;olvent Party was obliged to leave, in Pledge, the <HI>Mummies,</HI> or pre&s;erved Bodies of his decea&s;ed Ance&s;tors, till, by Indu&s;try or good Fortune, either He, or his Po&s;te|rity, &s;hould be enabled to redeem them. A Matter of refined, as well as charitable Policy; as nothing was held more infa|mous, among the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> than their Inability to produce the Mummies of their Forefathers.</P>
<P>The Laws of <HI>Holland,</HI> by their late Qualifications, &s;eem to acknowledge the Iniquity, or Inadequatene&s;s, of depriving a Man of the <HI>Po&s;&s;ibility of earning,</HI> merely becau&s;e he has not an <HI>immediate Ability to pay.</HI> Sen&s;ible, therefore, that all Men are Debtors to GOD, and reciprocally Deb|tors and Creditors to each other, they have ordained, that He, who impri&s;ons an in&s;olvent Debtor, &s;hall pay the pro|per Penalty, of his Malevolence or In|di&s;cretion, by maintaining the Party, from whom he takes the Ability of maintaining him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be admitted, that, were our Laws le&s;s &s;evere with Re&s;pect to Debtors; were People le&s;s afraid of a Jail on failure
<PB N="251" REF="252">of Payment; there would be le&s;s Credit, and, con&s;equently, le&s;s Dealing, in this, &s;o wonderou&s;ly wealthy, and trading a Nati|on.

<P>Many of our poor City Dealers are yearly undone, with their Families, by cre|diting Per&s;ons, who are <HI>privileged not to pay,</HI> or who&s;e Remotene&s;s, or Power, places them beyond the Reach of the Law. For, by the Return of <HI>non invent.</HI> generally made upon Writs, one would be apt to imagine, that no &s;ingle Sub-Sheriff knew of any &s;uch Thing, as a Man of Fortune, within his re&s;pective County, throughout the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>When I was la&s;t at <HI>Paris,</HI> I had the Honour to be introduced to Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Thimble</HI> and <HI>Goo&s;e,</HI> two Taylors of Quality. In the Cour&s;e of Conver&s;ation, it happen|ed to turn, as u&s;ual, on the Dulne&s;s of the Times, the Deadne&s;s of Trade, and De|lays of Payment. Says Mon&s;ieur <HI>Thimble,</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="253">I had the Misfortune to make Intere&s;t for the new Cloathing of the la&s;t Regiments that were tran&s;ported to <HI>Canada.</HI> But In|tere&s;t was, again, to be made for the Pay|ment; and, before that could be done, the Officers were &s;hipped off, with greater Va|lue of my Gold and Silver on their Backs, than, I am &s;ure, they carried of their own in their Pockets. Ambition, cried Mon|&s;ieur <HI>le Goo&s;e,</HI> Ambition has brought me to the very Brink of Ruin: I &s;corned to work for any thing under the Degree of Nobility, and be pox'd to me! and the Nobility are a Sort of People, whom we can never &s;et our Eyes on, except at the Time we are fitting on their Clothes.</P>
<P>Before Money became the Medium of Commerce, the &s;imple Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World was carried on by Truck, or the Commutation of one Commodity for ano|ther. But, when Men con&s;ented to fix certain rateable Values upon Money, as a ready and portable Equivalent for all Sorts of Effects, Credit was con&s;equently intro|duced, by the Engagements of &s;ome, to pay &s;o much Money in lieu of &s;uch Com|modities, or to deliver &s;uch or &s;uch Com|modities on the Advance of &s;o much Mo|ney; and States found it their Intere&s;t to &s;upport &s;uch public Credit, by enforcing the Performance of &s;aid Engagements.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
By the Common-Law of <HI>England,</HI> no Per&s;on, except the King, could take the Body of another in Execution for Debt; neither was this Prerogative of the Crown extended to the Subject till the Statute of <HI>Marlbridge,</HI> ch. 23. in the Reign of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> III.</P>
<P>Many contract Debts, through Vanity, or Intemperance; or borrow Money, or take up Goods, with the Intention of Thieves and Robbers, never to make Re|turn. When &s;uch &s;uffer, they &s;uffer de|&s;ervedly, in Expiation of their Guilt. But there are unavoidable Damages by Water, by Fire, the Cru&s;h of Power, oppre&s;&s;ive Landlords, and more oppre&s;&s;ive Law&s;uits, Death of Cattle, Failure of Crop, Failure of Payment in others; with thou&s;ands of &s;uch like Ca&s;ualties, whereby Men may be|come bankrupt, and yet continue blamele&s;s. And, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, one would think that the pre&s;ent Ruin was &s;ufficient Cala|mity, without the Exertion of Law to make that Ruin irreparable.</P>
<P>As all the Members of a Community are intere&s;ted in the Life, Liberty, and Labours of each other; He, who puts the Rigour of our Laws in Execution, by de|taining an in&s;olvent Brother in Gaol, is guilty of a fourfold Injury; fir&s;t, he robs
<PB N="254" REF="255">the Community of the Labours of their Brother; &s;econdly, he robs his Brother of all Means of retrieving his &s;hatter'd For|tune; thirdly, he deprives him&s;elf of the Po&s;&s;ibility of Payment; and, la&s;tly, he lays an unnece&s;&s;ary Burden on the Public, who, in Charity, mu&s;t maintain the Member whom he, in his Cruelty, confines.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince the Severity of Law is &s;uch, that He, who&s;e Misfortunes have render'd him in&s;olvent, mu&s;t make <HI>Sati&s;|faction, (for &s;o the Savages e&s;teem it)</HI> by &s;ur|rendering his Body to Durance for Life; it is &s;urely incumbent on our Legi&s;lators and Governors to make the Condition of the unhappy Sufferers as little grievous as may be.</P>
<P>But this mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Duty, this mo&s;t humane of all Cares, is yet to come. When a Debtor is delivered up into the Phangs of his Gaoler, he is con&s;igned to ab&s;olute and arbitrary Slavery; and Woe be to the Wretch who&s;e Poverty may not have left him a <HI>Sop</HI> for <HI>Cerberus.</HI> How more than mi&s;erable mu&s;t be the State of tho&s;e unhappy Men who are &s;hut in from all po&s;&s;ible Redre&s;s or Appeal again&s;t the de&s;potic Treatment of their &s;avage Keepers, who&s;e Hearts are habitually hardened to all Sen&s;e of Remor&s;e, and who&s;e Ears are render'd callous by ince&s;&s;ant Groans.</P>

We are credibly informed, that it is u&s;ual, with &s;uch Keepers, to ama&s;s con&s;i|derable Fortunes from the Wrecks of the Wretched; to &s;queeze them by exorbitant Charges and illicit Demands, as Grapes are &s;queezed in a Vine Pre&s;s, while one Drop remains; and then to huddle them toge|ther, into naked Walls and windowle&s;s Rooms; having got all they can, and no|thing further to regard, &s;ave the Return of their lifele&s;s Bodies to their Creditors.</P>
<P>How many of the&s;e Keepers exact, from their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pri&s;oners, &s;even and eight Shillings per Week, for Rooms that would not rent, at a Third of that Sum, in any other Part of this City. At times, Nine of tho&s;e wretched Pri&s;oners are driven to kennel together in a Hovel fit only to &s;ta|ble a Pair of Hor&s;es, while many unoccu|pied Apartments are locked up from u&s;e. Even a Sufficiency of the common Ele|ment of Water is refu&s;ed to their Ne|ce&s;&s;ities, an Advantage which the Felons in Newgate enjoy. Public and private Bene|factions are di&s;&s;ipated or di&s;po&s;ed of, at the Plea&s;ure of the Keepers, regardle&s;s of the Intention or Order of the Donors.

<P>But what avail their Complaints, if the Legi&s;lature have not authorized, or made it the Duty of &s;ome e&s;pecial Magi&s;trates to examine into and redre&s;s the&s;e crying Abu&s;es?</P>
<P>But, tell me, continued Mr. <HI>Fenton,</HI> were there any Pri&s;oners of Con&s;ideration among the confined Debtors? A few, Sir, of Note, and many who had been well to pa&s;s in the World. Among the&s;e, indeed, it was, that every Scene and Species of Mi&s;ery was di&s;played.

<P>The&s;e People fared incomparably wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the vulgar Herd; for, being a&s;hamed to beg at the Grates, they had nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, &s;ave their &s;canty Portion of &s;uch Charities as happen'd to be &s;ent in, from Time to Time, and this &s;carcely &s;upplied them with a &s;ufficiency of Water, black Bread, and Offal; while the Recollection of their former Affluence add|ed

Have you e'er a pretty Story for me, my <HI>Harry?</HI> Several Stories, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Harry,</HI> that were &s;weet pretty Stories, when I heard them; but, Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> had better tell them; they would be &s;adly bungled if they came through my Hands, Dada. The Company will make Allowances, replied Mr. <HI>Fenton;</HI> let us have the&s;e Stories in your own Way, <HI>Harry,</HI> ju&s;t as your Memory may happen to &s;erve you.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Day, Dada, as my Tu|tor and I were walking in the Court Yard of the Fleet Pri&s;on, who &s;hould I &s;py but my old Ma&s;ter, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> walking, very &s;ad, to and again by the Wall. He was &s;o pale and &s;habby, and &s;o fallen away,
<PB N="258" REF="259">that I did not rightly know him, till I looked at him very earne&s;tly. My Heart then began to &s;often and warm toward the poor Man; for it told me, that &s;omething very &s;orrowful mu&s;t have happened, be|fore he could have been brought to that Condition. So, I went up to him, with a Face, I believe, as melancholy as his own.</P>
<P>How do you do, good Mr. <HI>Vindex?</HI> &s;aid I. I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you, if I did not &s;ee you look &s;o &s;ad. He then &s;tared at me for &s;ome Time, and, at length, re|membring me, he looked concerned, and turned away to &s;hun me; but I took him lovingly by the Hand, and &s;aid, you mu&s;t not leave me, Mr. <HI>Vindex;</HI> won't you know your old Scholar, <HI>Harry Fenton?</HI> Yes, &s;ays he, ca&s;ting down his mournful Eyes, I know you now, Ma&s;ter; I know I u&s;ed you ba&s;ely, and I know why you are come; but, reproach me, and in&s;ult me, as much as you plea&s;e, all is welcome now, &s;ince I cannot lie lower, till I am laid in the Earth.</P>
<P>I do not mean to in&s;ult you, this Tear will witne&s;s for me, that I do not mean to in&s;ult you, my dear Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> and &s;o I wiped my Eye. Here are twenty Gui|neas, to put warm Clothes upon you in this cold Weather. Little and low as I am my&s;elf, I will try to do &s;omething bet|ter
<PB N="259" REF="260">for you, and &s;o give me one Ki&s;s in Token that we are Friends.</P>
<P>The poor dear Man then opened his broad Eyes, in a wild Stare upon me, with a Look that was made up, Half of Joy, and Half of Shame. He then kneeled down, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, that I might reach to ki&s;s him, and taking me into his Arms, you are not born of Woman, you are an Angel, an Angel, he cried; and &s;o he fell a crying, and cry'd &s;o &s;adly, that I could not, for my Heart, but keep him Com|pany.</P>
<P>I did all I could to pacify and make him chearful, and getting him up at la&s;t, you mu&s;t not part with me Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;aid I, we mu&s;t dine and &s;pend the Day together. Here is Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> my Tutor, you and he too mu&s;t be Friends.</P>
<P>I then led him, by the Hand, into a large ground Room that Mr. <HI>Clo&s;e,</HI> the chief Keeper, had appointed for us; and I ordered Dinner to be ha&s;tened and brought up. As &s;oon as we were all &s;eated, I be|gan to laugh and joke, after my fooli&s;h Way, in order to make poor Mr. <HI>Vindex</HI> merry. When I found that it would not do, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;aid I, be &s;o kind to let me know what the Money may come to for which you are confined? A terrible
<PB N="260" REF="261">Sum, indeed, my Darling, &s;aid he, no le&s;s than a hundred and fifty two Pounds. I then put my Hand in my Pocket, and, taking out two Bills and a little Matter of Money that made up the Sum, I put it into his Hand, &s;aying, my Friend &s;hall never lie in Gaol for &s;uch a Trifle as this.</P>
<P>Having looked for &s;ome Time at the Bills, with Amazement, he turned to my Tutor with a doubtful and &s;hamed Face; is this young Gentleman, Sir, &s;aid he, duely authorized to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch va&s;t Matters as the&s;e? He is, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> he is the Carver and Di&s;po&s;er of his Fa|ther's Fortune at Plea&s;ure; and I am con|fident that his Father will think him&s;elf doubly paid in the U&s;e that his noble Son has made of his Privilege this Day.</P>
<P>A Gleam then, like that of Sun&s;hine, broke through his &s;ad Countenance, as through the Clouds of a dark Day; and, are you the one, he cried, are you the one, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> whom I treated &s;o barba|rou&s;ly? You may forgive me, my little Cherubim, you, indeed, may forgive me, but, I never, I never &s;hall forgive my&s;elf. O, Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;aid I, I would very nearly undergo the &s;ame Whipping again, to do you twice the Kindne&s;s, and make you love me twice as much as you now love me.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">
Dinner was now &s;erved, and, calling for Wine, I filled him a Bumper, in a large Gla&s;s, which he drank to the Health of my glorious Dada, as he called you, Sir. Upon this, we grew very merry and friendly among one another, and, when Dinner was over, I begged him to tell me how he came to be put into Confinement.</P>
<P>O, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry,</HI> he cried, I have &s;uf|fer'd all that I have &s;uffer'd, very ju&s;tly, very ju&s;tly for my har&s;h and cruel U&s;age of you, Ma&s;ter <HI>Harry.</HI></P>
<P>After the Affair of the Hobgoblins, as you know, the Shame to which I was put by my Fright and by my Scourging, began to be whi&s;per'd, and then to be noi&s;ed about the Town. The Boys, at length, catched the Rumour, and began to hoot at me; and the more I cha&s;ti&s;ed them, the more they gathered about me, and &s;hout|ed after me, a Rod for the Flogger, a Rod for the Flogger!</P>
<P>No Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o deadly, no Bla&s;ting &s;o baneful, as Contempt to a Man, in the Way of his Profe&s;&s;ion. My Boys grew di&s;|orderly, and behaved them&s;elves, in School, without Re&s;pect to my Per&s;on, or Regard to my Government. Even my Intimates
<PB N="262" REF="263">&s;hunned me, and would ca&s;t at me a &s;ide Glance of &s;miling Scorn as they pa&s;&s;ed. My School then melted from me like Snow in a Fog. Even my Boarders for|&s;ook me. I &s;tood at a high Rent; my Ef|fects were &s;eized by the Landlord. It was in vain that I &s;ollicited Payment from the Parents of my Scholars. No one who was indebted to me, would give me a Penny; while all that I owed came like a tumbling Hou&s;e upon me; and &s;o I was ca&s;t into this Pri&s;on, from whence your Bounty has &s;et me free.</P>
<P>My poor broken hearted Wife would have accompanied me to Gaol; but, as I had not wherewithal to give her a Mor&s;el of Bread, I &s;ent her to an old Aunt who had the Humanity to take her in.</P>
<P>Alas, alas, poor Mr. <HI>Vindex,</HI> &s;aid I, had I gue&s;&s;ed any Part of the Mi&s;chiefs that our unlucky Pranks have brought upon you, I would have put both my Hands in|to the Furnace of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> rather than have Act or Part in &s;uch a Wicked|ne&s;s. For, herein we acted the Fable of the Frogs and the Boys, that which was <HI>Play</HI> to us, was <HI>Death</HI> to you, Mr. <HI>Vindex.</HI></P>
<P>In Con&s;cience, now, we are indebted to you for every Misfortune we cau&s;ed you;
<PB N="263" REF="264">and, as you are not yet paid for the Half of your Sufferings, I here give you my Hand and Word to make up a hundred and fifty Pounds more for you; and, for this, I will not accept the &s;malle&s;t Thanks, as I think it is no more than an Act of common Hone&s;ty. And I, cried Mr. <HI>Fen|ton,</HI> I hold my&s;elf indebted to you a thou|&s;and Pounds, my noble <HI>Harry,</HI> for that &s;ingle Sentiment. That's well, that's well, Dada, cried <HI>Harry,</HI> (leaping up and clap|ping his Hands) I &s;hall now be clear in the World with all my poor Creditors.</P>
<P>Thus, Dada, continued he, it rejoiced my Heart, greatly, to &s;end poor Mr. <HI>Vin|dex</HI> away, in &s;uch Triumph; while my Tutor and I went two or three Doors off, to &s;ee a mighty pretty young Creature who was &s;aid to be confined with her ancient Father. And I will tell you their Story, with two or three other Stories, more on account of the Incidents that happened while we were there, than of any Thing el&s;e that was wonderful or uncommon in them.</P>
<P>On tapping at the Door, we were de&s;ir|ed to walk in, and &s;aw a Female, with her Back to us, waving Bone Lace on a Cu&s;hi|on; while an elderly Man, with Spectacles on, read to her in <HI>Thomas a Kempis.</HI> They both ro&s;e to &s;alute us. Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> then
<PB N="264" REF="265">&s;tepped up, and, &s;eeing what they were about, cried, God cannot but pro&s;per your Work, good People, &s;ince you employ your Time to his Purpo&s;es, both on Earth and in Heaven. As an Earne&s;t of his Kindne&s;s to you, he &s;ends you, by us, a con&s;iderable Charity, which you &s;hall re|ceive as &s;oon as you inform us who, and what you are, and how you came here? Ble&s;&s;ed be the Me&s;&s;engers of my God, cri|ed out the Father, whether they come with happy or with heavy Tidings, I &s;ay with old <HI>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P>O Dada, I was quite charmed, when the Daughter turned to me. There was &s;uch a Sweetne&s;s, &s;uch a heavenly Harm|le&s;&s;ne&s;s in her Face, that I could have ki&s;&s;|ed her, and ki&s;&s;ed her, again and again.</P>
<P>As I had brought a Gla&s;s and the Re|mainder of our Bottle with me, we all got about a Board that was Half Stool and Half Table, and, after a Round or two, the good Man began his Story.</P>
<P>My Father's Name was <HI>Samuel Stern.</HI> He had a clear E&s;tate of nine hundred and fifty Pounds a Year in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and had, by my Mother, three Daughters and four Sons, of whom I was the &s;econd.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266">
My Father, unhappily, was a Loyali&s;t, and when the Troubles broke out between King <HI>Charles</HI> and the Parliament, he took up all the Money he could, at any Intere&s;t, and rai&s;ed a Company, at his own Co&s;t, which he headed on the Part of his Royal Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful Skirmi&s;hes, his Head was &s;plit in two by the Broad-&s;word of a Trooper, at the Battle of <HI>Nai&s;by.</HI> Im|mediately, all our Servants for&s;ook us, each carrying away with them whatever came to Hand; and, quickly after, the Soldiers of the Commonwealth came, carried off all the Cattle, and left nothing of our Hou&s;e, except the bare Walls.</P>
<P>In the mean time we, poor Children, huddled together into the Garden, and, there &s;eparating, ran and crept under Bu&s;hes and Hedges, as &s;o many Chickens endea|vouring to gain Shelter from the Kite.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Noi&s;e of the Tumult was over, we ro&s;e and looked about fearfully, and, getting together again, we helped one another through the Garden Hedge, and made, as fa&s;t as we could, to the Cottage of a neighbouring Farmer who had been our Father's Tenant. Here we were re|ceived coldly, and fared but very hardly for
<PB N="266" REF="267">that Night. On the next Day however, in order to get quit of us, as I &s;uppo&s;e, the Man went among our Relations, and pre|vailed on one to take a Son, and on another to take a Daughter, till we were all divided among them; and &s;o we enter'd on a kind of Service to our Kindred, a Service, as I believe, that is found, on Experience, to be much harder and more in&s;ulting than any Service to a Stranger.</P>
<P>I forgot to tell you, Gentlemen, that our Mother decea&s;ed before our Father en|gaged in Arms, in&s;omuch that we became Orphans in all Re&s;pects. I fell to the Share of an Uncle by my Mother's Side. He had a &s;mall E&s;tate of about a hundred and twenty Pounds yearly Income, with one Son, and a Daughter whom I thought very lovely.</P>
<P>My Uncle appointed me Over&s;eer of his Labourers, as al&s;o his occa&s;ional Clerk, for ca&s;ting Accounts, and inditing his Let|ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but, when it was intimated to him that there was a &s;ecret Liking between his Daughter and me, he called me a&s;ide, and, taking up a Book of profane Poems, he ki&s;&s;ed it and &s;wore, by the Contents thereof, that, if ever I married his Daugh|ter, he would not give us a Groat.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="268">
If you ever knew what Love was, &s;aid he to Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> you mu&s;t know that it breaks over &s;tronger Fences than the&s;e. In &s;hort, we were wedded and turned out of the Hou&s;e, without any thing to live upon, except about the Value of twenty Pounds, in &s;mall Matters, which had been given to my Wife, from Time to Time, by lady <HI>Goodly,</HI> her God-mother.</P>
<P>We made the be&s;t of our Way to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> My Wife under&s;tood Needlework, and, as I knew that my Father-in-law was quite irreconcileable, I joined my&s;elf to a Hou&s;e Painter, to whom I gave my Time for nothing, on Condition of his giving me a Sight into his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the third Year, my dear Wife brought this poor Creature into the World; but, happily, &s;he did not encumber Mankind with any more of our wretched and de|pending Progeny.</P>
<P>All our Care and Delight was fixed on this our little Daughter, and we thought nothing of any Pains or Labours that might &s;erve to introduce her, like her&s;elf, into the World.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Charles</HI> the IId. had a&s;cended the Throne, our Relations were fully a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="268" REF="269">that we &s;hould be re&s;tored to our ancient Rights and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and they contribut|ed, as it were for their own Credit, to &s;et us forth in a &s;uitable Manner for appearing at Court. There accordingly we attended, from time to time, for the Space of twelve Months, and got a Number of woful Me|morials pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty; but his Maje&s;ty was &s;o deeply engaged in his Plea&s;ures, or &s;o fearful of offending the Enemies of his Hou&s;e, that he gave no Attention to our Wrongs. There may al&s;o be &s;omething in the Brea&s;ts of the Great that excites them to Acts of Bounty, rather than Acts of Ju&s;tice; for the&s;e, as they apprehend, might be accepted as Matter of Debt and not as Matter of Favour.</P>
<P>Being tired of a fruitle&s;s Suit, I returned to my former Employment, and, by In|du&s;try and Frugality, I lived with my little Family quite happy and contented.</P>
<P>About ten Months ago, two Men came to our Lodgings. The one was in a rich Livery, and, having enquired for my Daughter, pre&s;ented her with a Note to this effect,&mdash;<Q>Lady <HI>Diana Templar</HI> &s;ends <HI>Diana Stern</HI> the enclo&s;ed Bill of twenty five Pounds, in order to put her into &s;ome little Way of Livelihood.</Q>&mdash;As my poor dear Child had no Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="269" REF="270">any Fraud or evil Intention in the Ca&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired the Men to return her mo&s;t humble Thanks and Duty to her Lady&s;hip, and away they went.</P>
<P>As this Lady was a di&s;tant Relation of my Wife's Father, my Daughter, in a few Days, dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in her be&s;t, and went to return Thanks to her Lady&s;hip in Per&s;on, but was told that &s;he was gone to her Seat in the Country.</P>
<P>In the mean time &s;he laid out her &s;up|po&s;ed Bounty in furni&s;hing a little front Shop with &s;ome millinary Wares, and was already beginning to get &s;ome Cu&s;tom, when, one Evening, two Bailiffs enter'd laid an Action upon her, and, taking her up in their Arms, hurried her into a Coach that drove up to the Door.</P>
<P>My Wife and I had ru&s;hed out, on hearing our Child &s;hriek, and &s;eeing a Coach &s;et off with her at a great Rate, we ran after as fa&s;t as we could, &s;houting and &s;creaming, and crying, &s;top the Coach, &s;top the Coach, a Rape, a Rape! At length a bold Fellow, who was pa&s;&s;ing, caught one of the Hor&s;es by the Bridle, and, while the Coachman la&s;hed at him, he took out his Knife and cut the Reins in two. A Mob then began to gather, where|upon a well dre&s;s'd Man, who was in the
<PB N="270" REF="271">Coach, leaped out and made his E&s;cape; but the Coachman was not &s;o lucky, the People pulled him from the Box, and having beaten and kicked him, they dragged him through the Kennel.</P>
<P>Mean while we got our Child out, and then the Mob overturned the Coach, and, jumping upon it, broke and da&s;hed it all to Pieces. We then thought that we had nothing further to apprehend, and, taking our Child between us, we turned back and walked homeward; but alas, we were not permitted to enter; the two Bailiffs met us, and, producing their Writ, again arre&s;ted our Daughter at the Suit, as they &s;aid, of <HI>Jonathan Delvil,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for the Sum of twenty five Pounds which he had lent her on &s;uch a Day. So they conducted her here, while my Wife and I accompanied her, weeping and &s;obbing all the Way.</P>
<P>I then took the&s;e poor Apartments to cover us from the Weather, and as my Wife grew &s;uddenly &s;ick and faint, I ha&s;|tened back to our Lodgings, and had our Bedding brought hither.</P>
<P>It was now evident that the pretended Gift of Lady <HI>Templar</HI> was no other than a diabolical Scheme of the Villain <HI>Delvil,</HI> to get the Per&s;on of my Darling within his Fangs; and I cur&s;ed my own Stupidity for
<PB N="271" REF="272">not perceiving it at fir&s;t; but ble&s;&s;ed be my God however, in all Events, that my Lamb was &s;till innocent, was &s;till un&s;ullied.</P>
<P>What with Grief and the Fright toge|ther, my dear Wife took to her Bed, from whence &s;he never ro&s;e, but expired on the fifth Day, ble&s;&s;ing and pre&s;&s;ing her Daugh|ter to her Bo&s;om. My poor Infant then fell as dead be&s;ide her Mother, and could not be recovered from her Fit in many Hours; and, indeed, it was then the Wi&s;h and the Prayer of my Soul, that we might all be laid and forgotten in one Grave toge|ther.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Darling was recovered however, I again wi&s;hed to live for her &s;ake, that I might not leave her without a Comforter or Protector, in the mid&s;t of a mercile&s;s and wicked World.</P>
<P>In order to pay the Nur&s;ekeeper, the Doctor, and Apothecary, as al&s;o to defray the funeral Expences, I left my Child with the Nur&s;ekeeper, and, going to our former Lodgings, I &s;old all her millinary Matters at &s;omething under a third of prime Co&s;t; and having di&s;charged the Lodgings and pay'd my Gaol Debts, I prepared to lay my precious Depo&s;it in the Womb of that Earth which is one Day to render her back, incorruptible to Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="273">
When the Corps was carrying out at the Door, my Child fell once more into Fits, and I was divided and quite di&s;tracted about what I &s;hould do, whether to &s;tay with the Living, or pay my Duty to the Dead. But I will no longer detain you with melancho|ly Matters, &s;ince all worldly Griefs, with all worldly Joys al&s;o, mu&s;t &s;hortly be done away.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I under&s;tood that Lady <HI>Templar</HI> was returnned to Town, I waited upon her, and giving her an Abridgment of our manifold Misfortunes, I produced the Note that had been written in her Name; but &s;he coldly replied, that it was not her Hand, and that &s;he was not an&s;werable for the Frauds or Villanies of others.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, my dear Girl accu&s;ed her|&s;elf as the Cau&s;e of all our Calamities, and pined away, on that Account, as pale as the Sheets &s;he lay in. She was al&s;o &s;o enfeeb|led, by her fainti&s;h and &s;ick Fits, that &s;he was not able to make a third of her u&s;ual Earnings; and as I, on my Part, was al&s;o di&s;qualified from labouring in my Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince I did not dare to leave my Child alone and un&s;heltered, we were reduced to a State of the greate&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">
One Day, Word was brought me that a Gentleman, a few Doors off, de&s;ired to &s;peak with me; and as they, who are &s;inking, catch at any thing for their Sup|port, my Heart flutter'd in the Hope of &s;ome happy Rever&s;e. Accordingly I fol|lowed the Me&s;&s;enger. His Appearance, in Dre&s;s and Per&s;on, was altogether that of the Gentleman.</P>
<P>He ordered all others out of the Room, and reque&s;ting me to &s;it be&s;ide him, in a half whi&s;pering Voice he began: I am come, Mr. <HI>Stern,</HI> from one whom you have great Rea&s;on to account your greate&s;t Enemy, I come from Mr. <HI>Delvil,</HI> at who&s;e Suit your Daughter now lies in Pri&s;on. I &s;tarted&mdash;Be patient, Sir, he &s;aid. He knows your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he knows all your Wants, he knows al&s;o that he is the Author of them; yet I tell you that he feels them, as if they were his own, and that it was not his Enmity, but his Love that occa&s;ioned them.</P>
<P>He depends on his old Uncle <HI>Dimmock</HI> for a va&s;t Fortune in Expectation. He &s;aw your Daughter and loved her; he &s;aw her again and loved her to Madne&s;s. He en|quired her Family, her Character, and found that he had nothing to expect from any licentious Propo&s;al. He feared, how|ever,
<PB N="274" REF="275">that all mu&s;t love her, as he did, and, to prevent other Pirates, he made u&s;e of the Stratagem which, contrary to his In|tentions, has brought you here. He never meant any thing di&s;honourable by your Daughter. Had he carried her clear off, you might all have been happy together at this Day; and, if you con&s;ent, he will marry her here, in the Pre&s;ence of a few Witne&s;&s;es, who &s;hall be &s;worn to Secrecy till his Uncle's Death; and he will in&s;tantly pay you down three hundred Pounds, in Recompence for your Sufferings, and will &s;ettle one hundred Pounds Annuity on your Child for Life.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own that, to one in my Circum|&s;tances, this Propo&s;al had &s;omething very tempting in it. But who is this Mr. <HI>Del|vil,</HI> &s;aid I, I know him not, I never &s;aw him? &mdash; I am the Man, Sir, &s;aid he. I would have di&s;charged my Action as I came to this Place; but I dare not permit your Daughter to get out of my Cu&s;tody; for, at the Lo&s;s of my Fortune, at the Lo&s;s of my Life, I am determined that no other Man living &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s her. I then pro|mi&s;ed him that I would make a faithful Narration to my Child of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, but told him, at the &s;ame time, that I would wholly &s;ub&s;cribe to her Plea&s;ure; and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">
As &s;oon as I repre&s;ented this Matter to my <HI>Diana,</HI> O no, my Papa, &s;he cried, it is impo&s;&s;ible, it never can be, I would do any thing, &s;uffer any thing, but this, for your Relief. Would you act the Marriage of the Lamb and the Wolf in the Fable? If &s;uch have been the Con&s;equences of this Gentleman's Affection for us, what have we not to expect from the Effects of his Aver&s;ion? I would prefer any Kind of Death to a Life with &s;uch a Man. And then, my Mother, &s;he cried, and bur&s;t into Tears) my dear Mother whom he has murdered! tho' he were worth Half the World, and would marry me publickly in the Face of the other Half; it will not be, it cannot be, indeed, my Papa!</P>
<P>Hereupon I writ Mr. <HI>Delvil</HI> almo&s;t a literal Account of my Daughter's An&s;wer. It is nearly five Weeks &s;ince this happened, and we have not hear'd any thing further from him.</P>
<P>In this time, however, we got acquaint|ed with a Family at the next Door, who&s;e Conver&s;e has been a great Con&s;olation to us. There is a Father and Mother with &s;even &s;mall Children, Boys and Girls; they are very worthy People, and of noble De&s;cent, but how they contrive to live at all I can't conceive, for they have no

<P>Here poor Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> ended; and you can't think, Dada, how my Heart leapt with Love toward him, on his recommend|ing others as more de&s;erving than him&s;elf. So I re&s;olved, at once, what to do, and taking two 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Notes from my Pocket|book, you &s;hall not be under the Nece&s;&s;ity, Mr. <HI>Stern,</HI> &s;ays I, of marrying your pretty Lamb here to the ugly Wolf, &s;o here is fifty Pounds to pay your Action, and Fees, and other &s;mall Debts.</P>
<P>On taking the Note, Dada, he looked at it very earne&s;tly, and when he &s;aw it was a true Note, he opened his Eyes and his Mouth &s;o wide, and &s;tood &s;o &s;tiff, without &s;tirring Hand or Foot, that he put me in mind of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife who was turned into a Pillar of Salt. However, I did not &s;eem to mind him, but turning to his Daughter, and &s;hewing her the other Note, Mi&s;s <HI>Diana,</HI> &s;ays I, here is fifty Pounds for you al&s;o, in order to &s;et you up in your little Shop again, but you &s;hall not have it with|out a certain Condition; what Condition, Ma&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he &s;miling; the Condition,
<PB N="277" REF="278">&s;ays I, of putting your Arms about my Neck, and giving me one or two &s;weet Ki&s;&s;es. She then looked earne&s;tly at me, with Eyes &s;wimming in Plea&s;ure, and &s;tarting &s;uddenly to me, and catching me to her Bo&s;om, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed my Lips, and my Forehead, and my Head, again and again, and then &s;et up as lamentable and loud a Cry, as if her Father had lain a Corp&s;e be|fore her.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stern,</HI> then, lifted up his Eyes, and dropping on his Knees, O my God, he cried, how bountiful art thou to a Wretch who is not worthy the lea&s;t of all thy Mercies! hereupon, the Daughter turned, and, &s;eeing the Po&s;ture of her Father, &s;he fell on her Knees before him, and throw|ing her Arms about him, he folded her in his al&s;o, and they wept plentifully upon each other.</P>
<P>How comes it, Dada, that Crying &s;hould be &s;o catching? However it be, Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> and I could not contain, and I &s;hall love him the better during Life, for the Tears that he &s;hed on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On hearing a &s;mart Rapping, Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> ro&s;e and opened the Door, where a Foot|man, almo&s;t breathle&s;s, delivered him a Letter. The Letter was to the Purpo&s;e that Mr. <HI>Delvil</HI> was ill of a Quin&s;y, that
<PB N="278" REF="279">he had but a few Hours to live, and re|que&s;ted Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> to bring his Daughter to him, that, by Marriage, he might give her a lawful Title to his Fortune. No, Papa, cried <HI>Diana,</HI> living or dead, nothing &s;hall ever bribe me to give my Hand to a Man who has had a Hand in the Death of my deare&s;t Mother.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> however, thought it advi&s;|able that Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> &s;hould attend the Me&s;&s;enger, to &s;ee if Mr. <HI>Delvil</HI> was really ill, or whether this might not be &s;ome new contrived Treachery.</P>
<P>This was a Day of Succe&s;&s;es to poor Mr. <HI>Stern.</HI> We had promi&s;ed to &s;tay with his <HI>Diana</HI> till his Return; and he had not been long gone till &s;ome one tapped at the Door. I opened it, and &s;aw an exceeding old and reverend Man; he was dre&s;&s;ed all in black, and his white Head looked like Snow on the Feathers of the Raven. Is <HI>Tom Stern</HI> here? &s;aid he. No, Sir, &s;aid I, he is gone into Town. I thought he was a Pri&s;oner; no, Sir, it is not he, but his Daughter, who is under Confinement. Will you give a feeble old Man leave to &s;it with you, Gentlemen? and &s;o down he &s;at. Come here to me, Child, &s;ays he to <HI>Diana,</HI> are you a Daughter of <HI>Tom Stern?</HI> I am, Sir, &s;o plea&s;e you. And what was your Mother's Name? <HI>Anne Roche,</HI> Sir;
<PB N="279" REF="280">but, alas! &s;he is not living, I was the Cau&s;e of her Death; &s;he broke her Heart, good Sir, on my being put to Gaol. I hope, Child, &s;aid the old Gentleman, that you were not impri&s;oned for any thing that was naughty. No, Sir, no, cried Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> it was her Hone&s;ty alone that brought and kept her here; had &s;he been le&s;s virtuous, &s;he might have been at Li|berty and flaunting about in her Coach.</P>
<P>The old Man then put on his Specta|cles, and ordering her to draw nearer, he took a Hand in each of his, and looking in|tently in her Face, what is your Name, my Dear? &s;aid he; <HI>Diana,</HI> honoured Sir. That is a pretty and cha&s;te Name, for an unchri&s;tian Name. Indeed, <HI>Diana,</HI> you are a &s;weet Babe, and the prettie&s;t little Pri&s;oner that ever I &s;aw. I will pay all your Debts, and give you a thou&s;and Pounds over, if you will come along with me, and be my Pri&s;oner, <HI>Diana.</HI> Ah, Sir, cried the Girl, it is too much to have broken the Heart of one Parent already; I would not leave my dear Father for any Man with all the Money in all the World. You do not leave your Father, he cried, by going with me, <HI>Diana.</HI> I am your true Father, the Father of <HI>Nanny Roche,</HI> the Father of her who bore you, your own Grandfather, my <HI>Diana.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="281">
Here &s;he &s;unk on her Knees, between his Knees, begging and be&s;eeching his Ble&s;&s;ing; while his Hands and Eyes were lifted in Prayer over her. He then rai&s;ed her, and placing her gently on his Knee, cla&s;ped her in his aged Arms; while &s;he threw hers about his Neck, and joining her Cheek to his, &s;obbed aloud and pour|ed her Tears into his Bo&s;om. The old Gentleman, however, did not expre&s;s his Concern by Word, or Sob, or even any Change of his Countenance, and yet his Tears fell fa&s;t, down his reverend and de|lighted Features, upon his Grandchild.</P>
<P>This, Dada, was a very plea&s;ing, though a very affecting Sight. As &s;oon as the Height of their Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;omething abat|ed, Mi&s;s <HI>Diana</HI> turned her Eye toward me, and &s;aid, You were plea&s;ed, my Grand-Papa, to promi&s;e that you would pay my Debts; but that is done already. This Angel here was &s;ent to prevent all others, and he further pre&s;ented me with this Bill of 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to &s;et me up in a better Shop than I kept before.</P>
<P>I rejoice, cried the old Man, I rejoice to find that &s;o much of Heaven is &s;till left upon Earth. But you, my <HI>Diana,</HI> are now in a Condition, rather to give Charity than receive it from any. Your dear
<PB N="281" REF="282">Uncle <HI>Jeremy,</HI> who traded to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> lately died of the Smallpox on his Pa&s;&s;age homeward. You are the Heir of his Fortunes, and the Heir of my Fortune; you are the whole and &s;ole Lady of all our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But, tell me, how much did this young Gentleman advance in your Favour? A hundred Pounds, Sir.</P>
<P>He then took out a Bank Note of a hundred Pounds, and having offered it to me, I did not dare to refu&s;e it, for fear of offending the Honour of the re&s;pectable old Gentleman; &s;o I held it in my Hand after a doubting Manner. My dear Mi&s;s <HI>Diana,</HI> &s;ays I, I will not be put to the Pain of taking this back again, but on the Condition of your telling me to whom I &s;hall give it? O, &s;he cried out in&s;tantly, to the Babies, to the &s;weet Babies at the next Door; I wi&s;h to Heaven I had as much more to add to it for their Sakes.</P>
<P>I then enquired the Name of her fa|vourite Family at the next Door, and be|ing told that it was <HI>Ruth,</HI> I looked over my Li&s;t, and found that Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI> was in for above &s;even hundred Pounds. This grieved me very much, as &s;uch a Sum nearly amounted to the Half of our whole Stock. However, I comforted my&s;elf with the Hope that God would &s;end &s;ome
<PB N="282" REF="283">one el&s;e, to make up to this poor Family what &s;hould be wanting on my Part.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> ju&s;t then returned. I beg Pardon, &s;aid he, Gentlemen, for detaining you &s;o long, but I could not avoid it. The unhappy Man is actually dying, a very terrible Death, indeed, in his full Strength, and almo&s;t in his full Health, &s;tifling and ga&s;ping for Air, which the &s;welling of his Glands will not &s;uffer to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I enter'd, he beckoned to me, and put this Paper, &s;ealed, into my Hand. And again, ob&s;erving that I was agitated and deeply concerned for the State under which he laboured, he reach|ed out his Hand to me, and, gra&s;ping my right Hand, put this Ring upon my Fin|ger.&mdash;This Paper contains, under his Hand and Seal, a Di&s;charge of the Action which he laid upon my Daughter, as al&s;o a Conveyance to us, of the Ca&s;h Notes enclo&s;ed, amounting to three hundred Pounds, in Con&s;ideration, as he recites, of our Lo&s;&s;es and unju&s;t Sufferings. And &s;o, my dear Ma&s;ter <HI>Fenton,</HI> I here return you your 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> with all po&s;&s;ible Acknowledg|ments, and a Sen&s;e of the Obligation that will never leave me, during Life.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="284">
Sir, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, I am already payed. That Gentleman, yonder, compell'd me to accept of the very Sum you offer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stern</HI> then &s;tarted, and, turning, he &s;aw his Uncle; and, eying him inqui|&s;itively, at length recollected who he was. He then &s;tepped up and, falling on his Knees before him, O, Sir, he cried, your Pardon, your Pardon! 'Tis all I pre&s;ume to a&s;k, I dare not hope for your Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> &s;aid the old Gentleman, I wanted to be even with you, I wanted to &s;educe your Daughter, as you &s;educed mine. But your Daughter, <HI>Tom,</HI> though come of very rebellious Parents, would not be &s;educed. How&s;omever, as I have taken a liking to her, &s;he mu&s;t come along with me, whe|ther &s;he will or no. And, as <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> concerning <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> &s;he &s;hall be mine and not thine, <HI>Tom;</HI> and my Name and the Name of my Fathers &s;hall be named upon her, according to her Inheritance. But, if you have any Affecti|on for this my Child, <HI>Tom,</HI> and are unwil|ling to part with her, you may follow her, and welcome.</P>
<P>Soon after, we got up, and, having con|gratulated this happy Family on the Ble&s;&s;ing
<PB N="284" REF="285">of their Meeting and Reconciliation, I &s;tepped to the old Gentleman, and, catching him about the Neck, tenderly took my Leave of him, as I did al&s;o of Mr. <HI>Stern.</HI> But, when I went to take leave of the fair <HI>Diana,</HI> &s;he drew &s;ome Steps backward, and, her Eyes and &s;weet Features beginning to &s;well, &s;he again run forward, and catch|ing me in her dear Arms, O, my Darling, my Darling, my Darling, &s;he cried, am I then going to lo&s;e you, it may be never to &s;ee you more! were it but once in a Week, in a Month, in a Year to behold you, even that would keep me alive for all the Remainder. O my be&s;t, my mo&s;t generous, my fir&s;t Pre&s;erver, it is you who might be the Seducer, who might make me and others to run after you bare-foot. But if we mu&s;t part, my little Angel, do but promi&s;e to know me in Heaven, and there your poor <HI>Diana</HI> will meet you, never to part any more.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay or do, Dada, in an|&s;wer to the dear Girl? my Heart &s;welled, almo&s;t to bur&s;ting, while &s;he care&s;&s;ed and wept over me. At length, with Words, as well as my Tears would give me leave to pronounce them, I demanded the Name of the Place to which &s;he was going, and promi&s;ed to pay her a Vi&s;it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly I could. We then parted very melancholy, notwith&s;tanding all our Suc|ce&s;s;
<PB N="285" REF="286">and, going out, I wiped my Eyes, and begged Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> to order Tea and Coffee, with a comfortable Entertainment for the Family, at the next Door, while I &s;hould go in and introduce my&s;elf as well as I could.</P>
<P>Having tapped gently at the Door, it was opened by a little ragged Boy of about five Years old. Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> &s;at full in my view, and her three little Daughters &s;tood before her, while &s;he examined them in the Old Te&s;tament Que&s;tions of who was the fir&s;t Man, and the wi&s;e&s;t Man, and the &s;tronge&s;t Man, and the olde&s;t Man, and above all, the Man after God's own Heart?</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> was a fine Woman, and had a great deal of humbled Dignity about her. I bowed to her as I enter'd, and, going familiarly up, I took her by the Hand and ki&s;&s;ed it. Allow me, Madam, &s;aid I, to in|troduce a little Neighbour to you; I lodge within a few Doors, and &s;hall think my&s;elf happy in being acquainted in your Family. Alas, my Dear, &s;ays &s;he, there are very few who &s;eek acquaintance with Calamity. They, who wi&s;h to relieve it, &s;eek acquain|tance with it, Madam.</P>
<P>Having eyed me all over, with an ear|ne&s;t Kind of Surprize, you look, my Love,
<PB N="286" REF="287">&s;aid &s;he, to be very Good-natured, and I dare &s;ay will be very charitable when you come to have the Ability. The little A|bility I have, Madam, &s;hall be &s;trained for your Service. In the mean Time, pray pardon the Freedom I have taken in order|ing Tea and Coffee into your Room, with &s;ome Cakes and Sweetmeats for the&s;e pret|ty Mi&s;&s;es. I will only trouble you, Madam, with one Gue&s;t more, it is Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> my Tutor, who, good Man, has been no Stranger to Poverty or Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Here &s;he called Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI> from an inner Room, give me leave, my Dear, &s;ays &s;he, to introduce a young Stranger to you, from what World he comes I know not, but I am &s;ure that he is not wholly of the World that we have lived in.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI>'s Countenance &s;poke at once the Meekne&s;s of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Patience of <HI>Job.</HI> Having &s;aluted, we both &s;at down. Mr. <HI>Ruth,</HI> &s;aid I, I have a Me&s;&s;age to you and your Lady from your &s;weet pretty Neigh|bour, Mi&s;s <HI>Diana Stern.</HI> In Token of her Re&s;pect and Affection for you, &s;he pre&s;ents you with this Ca&s;h Note of a hundred Pounds. <HI>Diana Stern!</HI> cried out Mr. <HI>Ruth,</HI> why, Ma&s;ter, &s;he is nearly as poor as our|&s;elves. By no Means, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you; her Grandfather is come to Town, &s;he is worth &s;everal Thou&s;ands, be&s;ides a con&s;ide|rable
<PB N="287" REF="288">E&s;tate to which &s;he is Heire&s;s. O, the dear Creature, the dear Angel, cried Mrs. <HI>Ruth,</HI> I will in&s;tantly go and pay her my Acknowledgments; &s;o up &s;he got and out &s;he run, before I could prevent her.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, Mr. <HI>Ruth,</HI> &s;ays I, my Dada is much fonder of me than I de&s;erve. He has given me a little Money to di&s;po&s;e of, at plea&s;ure, among the confined Debtors, and though I may not have enough to an&s;wer your Occa&s;ions, yet my Dada is &s;o very good and &s;o very generous, that if you give me the Sum of your Debts, with the Story of your Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, his Heart, I am &s;ure, will melt, and he will &s;et you clear in the World.</P>
<P>He made no An&s;wer, however, to this my Offer, but, lifting up his Eyes, he cried, well mighte&s;t thou &s;ay, great Saviour of the Simple, <HI>&s;uffer little Children to come unto me, for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> O, thou Babe of the Manger, <HI>thou fir&s;t born of many Brethren,</HI> here, indeed, is a dear and true little Brother of thine, but he &s;peaks in his Simplicity, and not accord|ing to Knowledge. Then, turning toward me, can you gue&s;s, my Darling, &s;aid he, what you undertake to do for me? I que&s;tion if the Charities of all this Nation would be &s;ufficient, when united, to effect my De|liverance.
<PB N="288" REF="289">Nothing, nothing but the Arm of the Almighty can do it. He will do it, indeed, in Death; but what then &s;hall be|come of my Wife and &s;even Infants, that truly is terrible, is wor&s;e than Death to think of.</P>
<P>While we were &s;peaking, two &s;weet little Fellows came in, the elde&s;t very nearly of my Size, but both clad in very thin and poor-looking Apparel. Having kneeled for their Father's Ble&s;&s;ing, they &s;lipt behind us, and, turning my Head to ob&s;erve them, I was quite a&s;hamed, and drew it back again, on perceiving that the poor Things were unlading their Pockets of old Cru&s;ts and broken Meats, which I &s;uppo&s;ed they had begged for the Fa|mily.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> ju&s;t then returned, and her Countenance looked &s;omething dejected. She took her Seat by her Hu&s;band, and, continuing a while &s;ilent, &s;he put her Hand|kerchief before her Eyes, and began in broken Words, Can you gue&s;s, my Dear, &s;aid &s;he, what Sort of a Creature this is whom we have got among us? This little heavenly Impo&s;tor, to lighten our Obliga|tion, would have per&s;uaded us that the hundred Pounds was the Gift of another, but it is all his own Bounty, it is all his own Graciou&s;ne&s;s. Come, my Daughters,
<PB N="289" REF="290">come, my Children, kneel down and re|turn your Thanks to this your Patron, your Benefactor, your little Father here!</P>
<P>O Dada, you would have pitied me &s;ad|ly, had you &s;een me at that Time. The poor dear Things came, all in a Clu&s;ter, pre&s;&s;ing, and catching, and cla&s;ping, and clinging about me; while my Love, and my very Heart was torn, as it were to Fritters among them. So I took them, one by one, in my Arms, and ki&s;&s;ed and embraced them, very cordially, calling them my Brothers and Si&s;ters. I then took out another hundred Pound Note, and, giving it to the elde&s;t of the Daugh|ters, here, my Dear, &s;aid I, I always loved the little Mi&s;&s;es better than the little Ma&s;|ters; here is for your&s;elf and your Si&s;ters to clothe you in a way more becoming your Family. And then taking a Note, of equal Value, I gave it to the elde&s;t Son, for him&s;elf and his Brothers, as I &s;aid, to help to educate them in a Manner, more agreeable to the Hou&s;e from whence they came.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> looked &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed at me, and at each other, that, for a while, they were not able to utter a Syllable. And, ju&s;t as they began to make their Acknowledgments, I cried, hu&s;h, hu&s;h! here comes my Tutor.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="291">
Mr. <HI>Clement</HI> ju&s;t then entered, followed by &s;everal Servants, who carried a Tea Equipage, cold Fowl, baked Meats, with other Pa&s;tries, and &s;ome Wine.</P>
<P>Having introduced Mr. <HI>Clement,</HI> we all got round the Table, and, after Tea and a further Regale, I be&s;ought Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI> to give us the Story of his Misfortunes.</P>
<P>My Father, &s;aid he, was Baron of <HI>Frankford.</HI> He left my Brother, with the Title, four thou&s;and five hundred Pounds a Year, entailed however upon me, in ca&s;e of his dying without Male I&s;&s;ue. And he left me a &s;mall Inheritance of four hun|dred Pounds yearly, to &s;upport, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, the Appearance of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>As my Concern bordered on my Bro|ther's E&s;tate, we &s;aw one another every Day, and continued, for &s;everal Years, in &s;trait and tender Amity.</P>
<P>Being both invited, one Day, to dine with other Company, at the Hou&s;e of a Neighbour called Mr. <HI>Heartle&s;s,</HI> a Que&s;|tion happen'd to be &s;tarted over the Bottle, whether the Method of &s;etting an Egg on End was originally the Invention of <HI>Colum|bus,</HI> or whether it was communicated to him by &s;ome other; and I unhappily e&s;|pou&s;ed
<PB N="291" REF="292">the Opinion that was oppo&s;ite to that of my Brother.</P>
<P>Now, though the Que&s;tion was not worth the very Shell of the Egg about which we debated, yet we enter'd as warmly into it as though a Province had lain at Stake; for it is not Truth or In|&s;truction that Di&s;putants &s;eek after; it is Victory alone, that is the Object of their Contention.</P>
<P>After &s;ome warm Words, and per&s;onal Retorts had pa&s;&s;ed between my Brother and me, he &s;tarted into &s;udden Pa&s;&s;ion and gave me the Lie; whereupon, reaching acro&s;s the Table, I gave him a Tap on the Cheek with the flat of my Fingers: Then, ri&s;ing furiou&s;ly from his Seat, he &s;wore a fearful Oath, and cried, I will ruin you, <HI>Harry;</HI> though it co&s;t me my E&s;tate, I will ruin you, <HI>Harry Ruth,</HI> with all who are yours.</P>
<P>The very next Day he mu&s;ter'd his Tenants and Labourers, and coming up|on me with a little Army, he laid mo&s;t of my Fences level with the Earth.</P>
<P>When I complained of this Violence to my next Neighbours, Mr. <HI>Heartle&s;s,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hollow,</HI> they prote&s;ted they would &s;tand by me again&s;t &s;uch outrageous Pro|ceedings
<PB N="292" REF="293">to the la&s;t of their Fortunes. They then advanced me, between them, five hundred Pounds for the Purpo&s;e. I immediately commenced Suit again&s;t my Lord's Tenants. But, though I ca&s;t them all with Co&s;ts, I unhappily found that nearly all my Money was &s;unk in the Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Meantime, &s;carce a Day pa&s;&s;ed wherein I was not &s;erved with a Subpoena from Chancery, to an&s;wer &s;uch or &s;uch a Bill, to which my Brother had procured me to be made a Party. And he al&s;o enter'd a Suit again&s;t me, him&s;elf, in order to inva|lidate my Father's Will, whereby I claim|ed my little Patrimony.</P>
<P>When I told this to my Friend Mr. <HI>Hollow,</HI> he broke into a loud Laugh. Your Title? cried he; the World can|not invalidate your Title, Mr. <HI>Ruth;</HI> I will let you have a thou&s;and Pounds upon it To morrow; and this I was under the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of accepting &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Contention &s;erves, with mutual Hands, to &s;hut every Door again&s;t Reconciliation. The more I had loved my Brother, the more I now dete&s;ted him. In&s;tead of any Submi&s;&s;ion or Overture to appea&s;e him, my Lips uttered, in daily Invectives, the Overflowings of my Heart; as I al&s;o was
<PB N="293" REF="294">a&s;&s;ured that, on his Part, he wi&s;hed me nothing le&s;s than eternal Perdition. Thus we burned, on both Sides, with unquench|able Fire, and the Kingdom of <HI>Satan</HI> was fully opened within us.</P>
<P>At length, my Body was impri&s;oned, at the Suit of my Neighbour <HI>Heartle&s;s,</HI> for 750<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and my Lands were taken under Execution, at the Suit of my Neighbour <HI>Hollow,</HI> for the Sum of 2000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> But, I &s;oon was informed that all this Money was my Brother's, who had advanced it, from Time to Time, to tho&s;e his clande&s;|tine Corre&s;pondents, in order to ha&s;ten and deepen my De&s;truction. When I un|der&s;tood this, I raged, I was all on Fire; and I took a horrid Plea&s;ure in the Notion of having the Fangs of a Tyger, that I might tear my Brother Piecemeal, and my fal&s;e Friends, Limb from Limb, and fea&s;t my Spirit on their Pangs, and mine Eyes on their Carnage.</P>
<P>But when I turned a Look on my Wife and &s;even Infants, Grief joined with Rage to tear me by a double Di&s;traction. I cur&s;ed the Lot to which I was appointed upon Earth; and I &s;hould have &s;ought &s;ome de&s;perate Means of putting an End to my Torments and Exi&s;tence together, but that I dreaded, by my Death, to give
<PB N="294" REF="295">Plea&s;ure to my Brother, ten times more than I dreaded the Pain of Death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>O, my Friends, had all that ever were &s;ainted come and preached to me, the Peace of our Lord Chri&s;t, at that Sea&s;on, it would have been no more than beating the Air, or &s;triving with &s;o many Spunges, to make an Impre&s;&s;ion on a Block of Mar|ble. It is Di&s;tre&s;s alone that, by Oppre&s;&s;i|on, makes Impre&s;&s;ion; that preaches the internal Doctrine of &s;en&s;ible Mortification, and humbles a proud Spirit, by plucking away all its Props.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I was as a Worm under the Foot of my God. I turned, and &s;truggled, and writhed, and fought with all my Force again&s;t the Cru&s;her. But, alas! all was in vain; he was too mighty for me; and Oppo&s;ition &s;erved only to add to my Angui&s;h.</P>
<P>At length, I was compelled to acquie&s;ce, rather through the want of Power than the want of Will to re&s;i&s;t. And I lay, as it were, without Motion, under his Di&s;pen&s;a|tions; at the &s;ame Time that my Heart reproached him, in &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Having &s;old all our Moveables, and even our wearing Apparel for Su&s;tenance, we were reduced to the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;end|ing
<PB N="295" REF="296">our elde&s;t Boys to beg Fragments of Victuals at Kitchen Windows, to keep us from utterly fami&s;hing. This I held to be &s;uch a further Shame and Di&s;grace as &s;tung my Soul to the quick; I therefore began to kick again&s;t the&s;e Pricks al&s;o; but finding that, the more I &s;purned, the &s;tronger I was held and pre&s;&s;ed into the Du&s;t, I gave up all Re&s;i&s;tance, and con|tented my&s;elf with grieving and weeping under the Hand of the Almighty.</P>
<P>From hence I gradually &s;unk into a State of re&s;igned Serenity which, although without Sun&s;hine, was yet without Di&s;|turbance. My Fury &s;moothed its Cre&s;t, my Pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ided, and I felt nothing more of Rancour again&s;t my Brother, or Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t my God.</P>
<P>The Activity of the Soul will find it&s;elf Employment. As I had now no further Pro&s;pect or Concern upon Earth, I began to turn my Thoughts and Attention to|ward Heaven. I locked my&s;elf into yon|der Clo&s;et. I threw my&s;elf into the Du&s;t. I have &s;inned, I cried, I have greatly &s;inned, O God! I am nothing, I am cru&s;hed even lower than the nothing that I am; &s;pare, &s;pare me from a deeper Perdi|tion, I be&s;eech thee!</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="297">
I felt that my Prayer was heard; Peace de&s;cended upon me like Dew upon the Night. The-Day Star began gradually to dawn to my Soul. The dark Kingdom of <HI>Satan</HI> gave way before the Kingdom of the Son of Light and Love; and I would no more have entertained any one of my former Pa&s;&s;ions, than I would have taken burning Coals and have buttoned them up in my Bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I was greatly delighted, Dada, with this Part and &s;ome more of Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI>'s Story, and I got him to repeat it over and over, that I might remember it the better.</P>
<P>I now, continued he, I now pitied my Brother as much as ever I had hated him. I grieved for having cau&s;ed the Lo&s;s of his Peace. I wi&s;hed to re&s;tore it to him. I wrote a penitential Acknowledgment of my Faults. I be&s;ought his Pardon, in the humble&s;t Manner, for the unfortunate Blow. I &s;ub&s;cribed to the Ju&s;tice of my con&s;equent Sufferings; and I &s;ent my Son, here, to attend his Lord&s;hip with my lowly Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Triumph, which this Humiliation gave to my Brother, &s;upplied him with Patience to go through my Memorial. But then conceiving, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that it
<PB N="297" REF="298">was dictated by mercenary Meanne&s;s and Hypocri&s;y, he tore it to Pieces and da&s;hed it into the Fire. Then, returning to my Child the Box which had &s;o enflamed the Soul of his Lord&s;hip, he kicked my poor little Fellow out of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My Child came home to me, weeping &s;adly; but I con&s;oled him the be&s;t I could, and mingled my Tears with his; not in any Re&s;entment for the Treatment receiv|ed, but through Grief for the Inveteracy of my unhappy Brother. O my God, I cried, I no longer repine at my Aba&s;e|ment, at the Weight of my Sufferings and Mortifications; I ble&s;s thee for them, O God; they have proved my be&s;t Friends, my mo&s;t &s;alutary Phy&s;icians. Cruel and &s;tern, indeed, is the Porter who &s;tands at the Iron Gate of Pain; but O, it opens upon Regions of inward Delight; for he who clothed him&s;elf with the Cro&s;s is all glorious within.</P>
<P>My happy Experience of this Truth opened, for me, a new Pro&s;pect into the My&s;tery of God's Di&s;pen&s;ation to Mortals; and threw a Number of &s;hining Lights on tho&s;e very Articles of Go&s;pel-Redemption, which had formerly appeared to me &s;o ex|ceptionable and gloomy. If God, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, hath &s;uffered Man to fall, he
<PB N="298" REF="299">hath al&s;o provided for him every po&s;&s;ible Means of Recovery and Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>Wherefore, when Sin came into the World, God al&s;o &s;ent Suffering, its in&s;epa|rable Attendant, to be a Cure and an An|tidote to the Poi&s;on thereof. If Sin, there|fore, hath thru&s;t the Kingdom of Heaven from within us, Suffering comes, as God's Forerunner; it relaxes and unfolds the brazen Gates of our polluted Temple, that Chri&s;t our Righteou&s;ne&s;s may enter, the very Hem of who&s;e Garment is Salvation to every Soul that lays hold upon it.</P>
<P>Here I took Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI> about the Neck, and, ki&s;&s;ing him, &s;aid, that I was &s;ure my Dada would be willing to pay his whole Debt in Return for the &s;weet In&s;tructions which he had given to his <HI>Harry.</HI> You &s;peak of your Dada, my Dear, &s;aid he, as though he were the Repre&s;entative of God, in the Go&s;pel, who forgave to his Servant ten thou&s;and Talents. What you have given me already, Ma&s;ter, is beyond any human Bounty that ever I hear'd of. I &s;hall therefore lay by two of the&s;e Notes, till I am better informed how far your good Father may be &s;atisfied with the Do|nation.</P>
<P>Soon after, we took leave, for the pre|&s;ent, of this honourable Family. We
<PB N="299" REF="300">then went among the other principal Deb|tors, who&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es indeed were great, though their Stories, except one, had little &s;ingular in them. In order to make our Money go as far as we could, we hurried here and there, through the Town, com|pounding with the &s;everal Creditors, from eight to ten and twelve and fifteen Shillings in the Pound; &s;o that, for about &s;ix hun|dred Pounds, we di&s;charged a Number who were indebted to the amount of a thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> about Noon, in the la&s;t Week, I &s;tepped to Mr. <HI>Ruth</HI>'s to &s;ee if the Family had been decently clad, agreea|ble to my Reque&s;t. There I found him and his four Sons clothed in warm and clean, though very coar&s;e Apparel; and he told me, that his Wife had gone abroad with her three Daughters, in order to put them al&s;o into a &s;uitable Condition.</P>
<P>While I &s;at with him, a young Woman came in, of a very genteel Appearance, though in a plain Dre&s;s. Don't you re|member the Girl, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, to Mr. <HI>Ruth,</HI> who u&s;ed to come to you, over Night, in a green Kerchief and a little red Mantle. I &s;hould be very ungrateful, in|deed, &s;aid he, if any Change of Dre&s;s could conceal from my Remembrance that &s;weet and charitable Countenance. O Sir,
<PB N="300" REF="301">&s;he cried, the few Shillings that I brought you, from Time to Time, came from a very affectionate Hand, though from a Hand you would little &s;u&s;pect of any Af|fection toward you; they came from your loving Niece <HI>Belinda Ruth,</HI> who has &s;hed many a Shower of Tears on your Misfor|tunes. May Heaven be her Portion, cried out the good Man, &s;ince Earth has no|thing equal to &s;o much Goodne&s;s. Indeed, Sir, continued the Girl, the little that your Niece &s;ent you was procured with much Difficulty and Danger to her&s;elf; for, from the Time that, on her Knees and with a Deluge of Tears, &s;he petitioned her Fa|ther, in your behalf, he kept a watchful Eye over her, and took from her all Fa|mily Tru&s;ts; &s;o that &s;he had nothing wherewith to &s;upply you, except the Price of &s;ome ca&s;t Gowns, and of other little Matters that &s;he feigned to have lo&s;t. Moreover, my Lord &s;wore vehemently that, if ever &s;he furni&s;hed you with the Value of a Farthing, or kept any kind of Corre&s;pondence with you or with yours, he would di&s;own and turn her into the public Streets.</P>
<P>You alarm me greatly, cried out Mr. <HI>Ruth.</HI> Is any thing ami&s;s, has any thing happened to my dear Child? She was a lovely little Lamb, a little Angel from her Cradle; though I &s;hould not know her,
<PB N="301" REF="302">now, if &s;he &s;tood erect before me. I hope, I &s;ay&mdash;tell me&mdash;proceed, I be&s;eech you!</P>
<P>There was a Servant, Sir, a Man whom your Niece thought very faithful, and therefore entru&s;ted with the Secret of my coming to you, that he might attend and &s;ee me &s;afe back again. This Fellow, pre&s;uming on the Confidence that was placed in him, would, this Morning, have taken indecent Liberties with his young Mi&s;tre&s;s. This &s;he re&s;ented in a becom|ing Manner, and threatened to complain of his In&s;olence to her Father. The revenge|ful Villain in&s;tantly ran, and told the Af|fair to his Lord with many Aggravations, as though his Daughter was robbing him of all his Sub&s;tance. Thereupon &s;he was ha&s;tily called, and, having in Part confe&s;&s;|ed the Charge, my Lord drew his Sword in his Fury, whereupon, giving a Shriek and a &s;udden Spring, &s;he got out of his Pre&s;ence, and has &s;ent me to know, Sir, if you will be plea&s;ed to receive her?</P>
<P>Yes, cried Mr. <HI>Ruth,</HI> to my Bo&s;om, to my Heart; with the &s;ame Plea&s;ure and Welcome that a Convict receives Pardon on the Hour of Execution.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> enter'd, with her three Daughters, who, running up to their
<PB N="302" REF="303">Father, dropped together on their Knees before him for a Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>While his Hands and Eyes were rai&s;ed in Prayer over them, the young Stranger &s;tepped earne&s;tly up, and, falling on her Knees be&s;ide the Daughters, &s;he broke into Tears, and cried aloud, ble&s;s me, ble&s;s me al&s;o, O my Father! I am your Niece, your <HI>Belinda,</HI> my Father is no more! Yours, my Lord, is the Title, yours all the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I now, in my Turn, depend on your Bounty for a Mor|&s;el of Bread. My Brother, my Brother dead! exclaimed Mr. <HI>Ruth.</HI> He is, my Lord, &s;he replied; he was &s;uffocated by his ri&s;ing Choler, and expired on the Spot.</P>
<P>While the young Lady &s;poke, Mrs. <HI>Ruth</HI> looked, as quite terrified by the Tidings of &s;uch a &s;udden Elevation; and clapping her Hands together, and lifting her Eyes, &s;he cried, it cannot be, it is impo&s;&s;ible! Ours the Title, ours the For|tune!&mdash;O my God!&mdash;O my Hu&s;band!&mdash;O my Children!&mdash;and down &s;he dropped.</P>
