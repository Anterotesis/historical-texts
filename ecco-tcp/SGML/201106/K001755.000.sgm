<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two very different methods of curing the Gonorrhoea, the one wholly by internal medicines, the other principally by injection. The former is generally a very uncertain and di&s;agreeable proce&s;s, the latter is both expeditious and &s;afe, but dreaded by many per&s;ons on ac|count of a fal&s;e idea which has long pre|vailed. This ill founded notion it is my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to confute by &s;everal arguments &s;upported by quotations from Authors of di&s;tingui&s;hed credit.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pott</HI> recommends the advice given by Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> to a &s;tudent, "to con&s;ider one di&s;ea&s;e at a time, and to become tho|roughly acquainted with that, before he
<PB N="iv" REF="3">undertakes another." He further ob&s;erves, "that the only means by which true and u&s;eful knowledge is to be obtained in every part of &s;urgery, are a competent knowledge of the anatomical &s;tructure of the human frame, a clo&s;e attention to the &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es in the living, and a minute examination of the appear|ances in the dead: the&s;e are the great foun|tains of all medical knowledge." Mr. <HI>Pott</HI> has here pointed out, in a very judicious manner, the path which every chirurgical practitioner and writer &s;hould pur&s;ue, who undertakes to explain the true nature, &s;eat, and cure of any bodily di&s;order.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE ON THE GONORRHOEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE part principally affected by the Gonorrhoea is the penis, which con|&s;i&s;ts of three parts; two of which are called corpora caverno&s;a, and lie on each &s;ide, and a third, which is &s;ituated underneath, named corpus &s;pongio&s;um urethrae, con|&s;i&s;ting of the bulb and membranous part, continued on to the bladder, and termina|ting at the other extremity in the corona, or glans penis. The urethra has three glands, which were di&s;covered by <HI>Cowper,</HI> and called mucous glands, from the tena|city of the liquor which they &s;eparate. There are al&s;o two, (or rather one,) about the &s;ize of a nutmeg, they lie at the neck
<PB N="8" REF="6">of the bladder, between the ve&s;iculae &s;emi|nales and penis, under the o&s;&s;a pubis, al|mo&s;t within the pelvis of the abdomen; they &s;eparate a limpid glutinous humour, which is carried into the urethra by &s;everal ducts, which enter near tho&s;e of the pro|&s;tatae The two fir&s;t of <HI>Cowper</HI>'s glands are about the bigne&s;s of a French bean, of a depre&s;&s;ed oval figure, and a yellowi&s;h colour like the pro&s;tatae, being on each &s;ide the bulb of the urethra, a little above it. Their excretory ducts ari&s;e from the internal &s;urface next the inner membrane of the urethra, into which they open a little lower by two di&s;tinct orifices, ju&s;t below the curvature of the o&s;&s;a pubis in perinaeo, where they di&s;charge a tran&s;parent vi&s;cous liquor. The third mucous gland is a &s;mall conglobate yellowi&s;h gland, like the former, but &s;omewhat le&s;s, &s;ituated above the angle of the flexure of the urethra, un|der the o&s;&s;a pubis, in the perinaeum, near the anus: it has two excretory ducts, which enter the urethra obliquely, a quarter of an inch below the two former, and di&s;charges a liquor like them both in colour and con|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of the Gonorrhoea in women is the vagina, which is affected with a di&s;|charge
<PB N="9" REF="7">charge like that of the urethra in men. It lies between the bladder and inte&s;tinum rectum, and has rugae, under which are &s;mall glands, who&s;e excretory ducts are called lacunae. The&s;e glands &s;eparate a mucilaginous &s;limy liquor to lubricate the vagina, and are the &s;eat of the Gonorrhoea in this &s;ex, as the glands in the urethra are in the male. The meatus urinarius being a very &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, the heat and &s;calding is con&s;equently much le&s;s than in the men.</P>
<P><Q>"A Gonorrhoea from the urethra in a man, begins with an unea&s;ine&s;s about the parts of generation, together with an ap|pearance of a little whiti&s;h matter, about the orifice of the urethra, a little &s;welling and &s;ometimes redne&s;s there, and a &s;light pungency upon the evacuation of urine. The whiti&s;h matter &s;oon increa&s;es in quantity, the inflammation about the end of the urethra becomes more evident, and for the mo&s;t part there is now a ten|&s;ion and hardne&s;s through the whole of it, a &s;welling of the lacunae, and a &s;en|&s;ation of &s;tricture in the penis, particu|larly on erection. The matter &s;till in|crea&s;es, flows out, and grows thinner, lo&s;es all its adhe&s;ivene&s;s, and is of a yellow, or greeni&s;h colour. There is
<PB N="10" REF="8">now always a redne&s;s about the end of the canal; often a pain from the di&s;|tention of the urethra, during the eva|cuation of urine, and a much &s;everer to|wards the orifice, from its &s;timulus, with an increa&s;e of the redne&s;s ju&s;t after it is evacuated. The inflammation prevents the exten&s;ion of the urethra in erection, &s;o that the penis is at that time curved downwards with great pain, which is in|crea&s;ed if it be rai&s;ed towards the belly, and the &s;timulus occa&s;ions it often to be erected, e&s;pecially when warm in bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI>'s Elements of Phy&s;ic.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>I believe it would generally be e&s;teemed good practice on this occa&s;ion to give nitre in con&s;iderable quantity, a purging elec|tuary, pill, or &s;alts, and to take blood freely from the patient; al&s;o to direct large quantities of diluting liquors, and further to recommend a &s;trict regimen and ab&s;tinence from particular meats, vegetables, and &s;trong liquors. The que&s;tion is, are &s;uch medicines and re&s;triction nece&s;&s;ary? In my humble opinion they are not, and they appear, upon the whole, to do more harm than good, as I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate from the experience of tho&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="9">who are well qualified to give an opinion in a matter of this kind, and al&s;o from my own ob&s;ervation and practice.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> remarks, "that purgatives not only inflame the rectum, but al&s;o extend their irritation to the urethra." May not chordee and priapi&s;m then often be attri|buted to this cau&s;e?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> recommends "increa&s;ing the &s;ecretion a little, by &s;uch gentle pur|gatives as procure only two or three evacu|ations a day."&mdash;But who can en&s;ure his patient two or three &s;tools only in a day? The inte&s;tines being once put into motion, will not accommodate them&s;elves exactly to our wi&s;h or convenience. Happily for the patient, it is certain that even gentle purging may be di&s;pen&s;ed with on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>He adds, "that &s;evere purging often augments the inflammatory &s;ymptoms, brings on &s;trangury and exulcerations, gives occa&s;ion to inflammation of the te&s;ticles, and other neighbouring parts, or it &s;tops the running before the infection is wa&s;hed off, and the Gonorrhoea either returns in a few days, or exulcerations take place."</P>
<P>The Doctor further ob&s;erves, "that long continued purging is apt to weaken the
<PB N="12" REF="10">&s;tomach and inte&s;tines, to hurt the di|ge&s;tion, to produce ob&s;tinate gleets, and leave hypochondriacal &s;ymptoms, particu|larly in irritable or melancholic habits."</P>
<P>Many more authorities might be adduced in proof of the bad effects of a cour&s;e of purgatives in the&s;e ca&s;es, which are generally of con&s;iderable duration, when treated in this manner. Neither are anti|phlogi&s;tic remedies to be depended upon, as they &s;ometimes produce the very contra|ry effect to what was expected from them: among&s;t the fir&s;t of the&s;e is nitre, in inflam|matory di&s;orders. Dr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> a late writer of no &s;mall credit, reckons, that nitre often gives relief in &s;tranguries, and heat of urine, proceeding either from a &s;imple or a vene|real taint; and indeed the greate&s;t part of practitioners have always given it, and &s;till continue to give it in the venereal <HI>ardor urinae.</HI></P>
<P><Q>"This practice, however, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Hope</HI> in his lectures on the Materia medica, I am apt to believe has taken its ri&s;e from the name of ardor having always been given to the pain in evacuating the urine, during the time of a venereal inflamma|tion of the urethra, and the name and virtues of a cooler, having always been
<PB N="13" REF="11">attributed to this &s;alt. But it is certain that the urine pa&s;&s;ed during the time of a venereal inflammation is no warmer than at other times, and therefore to pre&s;cribe a cooler to allay the heat of it, is ab&s;urd: and I am per&s;uaded, that on a free and candid examination of this matter, it will be found, that nitre has not the &s;malle&s;t power of alleviating the pain which is then felt; for I have given it in all the different &s;tages of this di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;mall and in large do&s;es; but from the &s;ole u&s;e of it in a great number of trials, have never been able to ob&s;erve that it afforded the lea&s;t relief. Nor, when we con&s;ider the cau&s;e of that pain, and the effects of nitre, have we any rea&s;on to expect it; for the pain certainly proceeds from the acrid &s;alts in the urine, &s;timu|lating the inflamed or excoriated urethra; and a &s;olution of nitre applied to any ex|coriated part always gives con&s;iderable pain. Experiments a&s;&s;ure us, that on taking nitre into the &s;tomach, the urine becomes impregnated with it. The larger therefore the do&s;es are, the &s;tronger will this impregnation be, and the greater &s;timulus added to the urine; &s;o that we may &s;en&s;ibly conclude, that this &s;alt will
<PB N="14" REF="12">rather augment than dimini&s;h the pain in evacuating it. The Doctor further re|marks, that there are many weak and delicate &s;tomachs which cannot bear the cold it produces, and others in whom it always creates &s;ickne&s;s and nau&s;ea."</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance of taking great quantities of nau&s;eous me|dicines, we find there is the greate&s;t un|certainty as to their real effects on the di&s;ea&s;es they are intended to remove. A powder or medicine of any kind, applied to blood in a ba&s;on, may vi&s;ibly affect that fluid, and render it thin or thick; yet being taken into the &s;tomach, and po&s;&s;ibly from thence into the circulation, it may have a very different effect on the circula|ting fluids, or perhaps none, having un|dergone a material alteration in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A late celebrated Lecturer on the Mate|ria Medica, di&s;cour&s;ing with his pupils on the powerful operations of mucilaginous medicines in the alleviation of the pain ari&s;ing from the &s;tone in the bladder, re|marked that &s;uch medicines were extremely u&s;eful where the &s;tone was of the mulberry kind, and apt to vellicate the coats of the bladder. He told them the ropy mucilage
<PB N="15" REF="13">would envelope the &s;tone, and make a uni|formly &s;mooth &s;urface, entirely depriving it of its a&s;perities, and con&s;equently of its power of hurting the bladder.</P>
<P>It is difficult for one conver&s;ant with the mechani&s;m of the human body, and the operation of medicine, to conceive, that a mucilage given by the mouth will arrive at the bladder in that &s;tate. We are cer|tain that particular remedies will &s;timulate particular parts: bal&s;am of capivi, for in|&s;tance, being ab&s;orbed, is known to af|fect the kidnies and bladder, by the &s;trong odour it imparts to the urine; but we do not find this, or any other medicine, ex|cept quick&s;ilver, will pa&s;s off in the &s;ame form in which it is admini&s;tered by the mouth. This bal&s;am is very much e&s;teem|ed for its great virtues, particularly in cer|tain &s;tages of the Gonorrhoea, but it is &s;o very di&s;agreeable, on account of its oily and bitter quality, as well as its &s;mell, that &s;ome patients are &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with it, and others will not be prevailed upon to take it at all; we cannot therefore think it &s;trange, that many gentlemen &s;hould often prefer injections to all other means, which do not appear to produce effects in any degree equal to the trouble which at|tends
<PB N="16" REF="14">them. It mu&s;t be acknowledged that patients often &s;uffer more from the remedy than the di&s;order; they are often more emaciated, weak, and pallid in their countenance, (circum&s;tances which fre|quently lead to di&s;agreeable di&s;coveries,) from the operations of purgatives in the &s;pace of one week, than they would have been in a month, if there had been no attempt made to check the progre&s;s of this di&s;order.</P>
<P>There are many people who have not lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue the &s;everal directions and pre&s;criptions given by practitioners; and if they could find time, they would have but little inclination to undergo &s;o much fatigue and trouble. Such tedious pro|ce&s;&s;es are very ill contrived for the mul|titude, who mu&s;t be, <HI>and are daily cured by means much more ea&s;y, expeditious, and quite as effectual;</HI> and if one cla&s;s of men are cured in this manner, why &s;hould not all enjoy the &s;ame benefit?</P>
<P>I have a&s;&s;erted, that a regimen, or par|ticular diet, is not nece&s;&s;ary in the cure of the Gonorrhoea, when treated in the man|ner here recommended. Some have a&s;ked, if the di&s;order is not inflammatory, and if living low is not indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="17" REF="15">in every complaint of this kind? It may be &s;aid in reply, that this is a local inflam|mation, which yields at once to a cooling detergent liquid applied to the part; whil&s;t internal medicines are commonly &s;low and uncertain in removing it.&mdash;When mercury does not pa&s;s into the &s;tomach, there is no occa&s;ion to enjoin re&s;trictions with re&s;pect to diet, &s;ince no di&s;agreement can then happen; patients may live in the &s;ame manner as at other times, only avoiding exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hugh Smith,</HI> who is an advocate for vitriolic injections, a&s;&s;erts, "That a Go|norrhoea, if taken in the beginning, may generally be cured in a fortnight, without any injuty to the con&s;titution, or any ill effects what&s;oever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Formulae Medicamentorum.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I have met with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of this complaint from the &s;ame &s;ort of injections, and find they an&s;wer much better than mercurial ones, which depo&s;it a con&s;iderable &s;ediment, and being conveyed into the urethra, cau&s;e irritation and pain in that tender pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The injection &s;hould be applied cold, rather than warm, (as cold braces and
<PB N="18" REF="16">warmth relaxes,) which I find often com|pletes the cure in much le&s;s than a fort|night, the time mentioned by the Doctor.</P>
<P>If the injection cau&s;es any more than a &s;light &s;en&s;ation of &s;mart or pain in the pa&s;|&s;age, it is evidently too much impregnated with vitriol, and the &s;olution mu&s;t be made weaker, as the irritation of the liquor would increa&s;e the &s;ymptoms in&s;tead of dimini&s;h|ing them.</P>
<P>The great objection to this &s;ort of prac|tice is rai&s;ed on the &s;uppo&s;ition that <HI>In|jections</HI> are apt to produce <HI>&s;tricture</HI> in the urinary pa&s;&s;age, This idea, I apprehend, is not well founded; having enquired of many different people who have been troubled with <HI>&s;trictures,</HI> if they had u&s;ed injections for the cure, and was generally an&s;wered in the negative.&mdash;I am much inclined to think with Doctor <HI>Fordyce,</HI> "That when a <HI>gonorrhoea</HI> continues long, it &s;ometimes produces a <HI>&s;tricture</HI> in the part." Inflammation is naturally di&s;po|&s;ed to produce contraction and <HI>&s;tricture</HI> in the different &s;acculi and pa&s;&s;ages of the body, as well as in the <HI>urethra:</HI> therefore we may conclude, that evils are often at|tributed to <HI>Injections,</HI> which in fact owe
<PB N="19" REF="17">their origin to other cau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the long duration of this di&s;temper produces &s;tric|tures and ob&s;tructions, then what removes the di&s;order quickly, mu&s;t undoubtedly prevent the above evils, in|&s;tead of cau&s;ing them.</NOTE>. The &s;ame gentleman ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that omitting the <HI>injection</HI> once or twice will often make it fail of curing, when it would have other|wi&s;e produced that effect<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">If the Injection &s;hould not produce the de&s;ired ef|fect, it will be right to enquire if the urine pa&s;&s;es freely, and whether it divides into two &s;treams, or more; or whether it comes out twi&s;ted, like a cork-&s;crew. In the&s;e ca&s;es, it is not likely the Injection &s;hould effect its purpo&s;e, being unable to pa&s;s: recour&s;e mu&s;t therefore be had to the <HI>Bougie</HI> to re&s;tore the pa&s;&s;age to its natural &s;tate.</NOTE>. He likewi&s;e remarks, that patients treated in this man|ner, are le&s;s liable to inflammation of the te&s;ticles, or of the glands in the groin (on to <HI>chancres</HI>) or <HI>&s;trictures.</HI> The&s;e ob&s;erva|tions are certainly founded on fact. It is the general opinion, that &s;mall do&s;es of mercury ought to accompany the <HI>Injection.</HI> See <HI>Fordyce, Saunders, Smith,</HI> and others.&mdash;Conformably to this idea, I give a grain of mercurial powder, and apply it to the cu|ticular &s;urfaces of the lips, or the tongue, and at the &s;ame time make u&s;e of the <HI>vi|triolic,</HI> in preference to every other <HI>Injection.</HI> Though I have made repeated trials of &s;e|veral,
<PB N="20" REF="18">I know of no other which would remove the di&s;order in twice the time which this does; but there are &s;ome that would not &s;ucceed at all, and rather aggravate the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>It is now proved by a repetition of in|genious experiments, and generally admit|ted, that the di&s;charge in a <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> pro|ceeding from the <HI>wethra,</HI> is not <HI>pus,</HI> but <HI>mucus. Pus</HI> is the matter which proceeds from wounds and ulcers, but <HI>mucus</HI> comes from &s;urfaces not ulcerated, though &s;ome|times inflamed. Dr. <HI>Hunter</HI> &s;ays, he has often di&s;&s;ected the <HI>urethra</HI> of per&s;ons who have died, having the <HI>Gonorrhoea</HI> at that time, and he adds, that he never di&s;co|vered any ulcer in the pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Mucus</HI> is, in it&s;elf, an innocent, mild fluid, but ca|pable of acquiring virulence and acrimo|ny from contagious infection.</P>
<P>The Gonorrhoea is an increa&s;ed and virulent di&s;charge from the <HI>mucous</HI> glands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cribed in Pages 1 and 2.</NOTE> of the urinary pa&s;&s;age. Mucus, when untainted, is tran&s;parent like the white of an egg, appears as a drop &s;ometimes at the orifice of the urethra next the glands, is of a mucilaginous vi&s;cidity, and its u&s;e is to &s;heathe and defend the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="21" REF="19">from the irritating &s;alts conveyed in the urine. It re&s;embles the fluid in the eye, which is &s;ecreted in &s;mall quantity, but when the lachrymal gland is &s;timulated by grief, du&s;t, or other offending &s;ub&s;tance, the di&s;charge becomes copious and &s;ome|times acrid.</P>
<P><HI>Darwin</HI> ob&s;erves, in his experiments on pus and mucus, "That whenever the &s;ecretion of any fluid is increa&s;ed, there is at the &s;ame time an increa&s;ed heat in the part." The &s;ame gentleman ob&s;erves, that "the catarrhal humour from the no&s;trils of &s;ome who ride in fro&s;ty weather, and the tears which run down the cheeks of tho&s;e who have an ob|&s;truction of the puncta lachrymalia, are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, by their abounding in ammoniacal or muriatic &s;alts, whence they inflame the circumjacent &s;kin: thus in the catarrh, the upper lip becomes red and &s;welled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the &s;alt|ne&s;s of its ta&s;te. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corro&s;ive tears, and the ichor of &s;ome herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the contiguous parts, and is pungent|ly &s;alt to the ta&s;te, as &s;ome patients have informed him."</P>
<PB N="22" REF="20">
<P>When the mucous membrane of the no&s;e is &s;timulated by a violent cold, or other cau&s;e, we often &s;ee an extraordinary quantity of di&s;charge from that organ; yet no one &s;u&s;pects the exi&s;tence of any ulcers there, and I have often ob&s;erved, that the di&s;coloured mucus of that part bears &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the viru|lent di&s;charge in the gonorrhoea, that it would frequently perplex per&s;ons conver|&s;ant in the&s;e matters to di&s;tingui&s;h two handkerchiefs, the one from the other, when &s;tained with the re&s;pective mucus. Either of the&s;e fluids having acquired acrimony will inflame, and &s;ometimes &s;lightly exco|riate irritable nervous membranes.

<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE REMEDIES in USE for the CURE OF THE LUES VENEREA, FROM ITS Fir&s;t Appearance in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE cure of this di&s;order, which has now prevailed all over <HI>Europe</HI> near three centuries, has not been &s;o much im|proved by the profe&s;&s;ion as might have been expected during &s;o long a period. It raged for &s;everal years uncontrouled, be|fore an effectual remedy for it was di&s;co|vered. After the antidote for this poi&s;on was found to exi&s;t in mercury, yet &s;till &s;o very unfortunate was the applicat on of it, that many lives were lo&s;t by &s;a|livations, &s;hocking to relate, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="26" REF="23">of the want of &s;ufficient know|ledge of the nature and qualities of this mineral, in the practitioners of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t attempts of the cure of vene|real maladies, by this remedy, were learned from the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who having recom|mended mercurial ointments in the <HI>Lepro&s;y</HI> or &s;cabies, gave a handle to the <HI>Italian</HI> phy&s;icians, to try their efficacy in removing the foulne&s;s of the &s;kin from a new and ter|rible contagion: neither were they &s;paring of their liniments, which they continued to rub in for twelve, fifteen, nay, &s;ome|times for above thirty days together<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mead</HI> on Poi&s;ons.</NOTE>," a very dangerous practice, which prevails too much even in the pre&s;ent age. Sar&s;aparilla, &s;a&s;&s;afras, guaicum, have all at different pe|riods been in more or le&s;s e&s;timation for their antivenereal virtues; but mercury is the only antidote for this poi&s;on, on which any age has repo&s;ed an entire confidence.</P>
<P>In 1685, Dr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> wrote on this among&s;t other &s;ubjects. His account &s;hews, that although the u&s;e of the re|medy was better under&s;tood, yet the cure of the di&s;order was but little improved.</P>

<P>In 1731, Dr. <HI>Turner,</HI> a member of the College of Phy&s;icians in <HI>London,</HI> who had made the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e his particular &s;tudy, thought proper to communicate his ob&s;ervations and practice to the world. His dra&s;tic purges, and mercurial pre&s;criptions, were &s;uch as might de&s;troy the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titution; what then mu&s;t have become of tho&s;e of a weak and delicate frame?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> has advanced a &s;y&s;tem of his own, apparently le&s;s detrimental than former ones, and which has been very much adopted of late years. The Doctor's theory of the di&s;ea&s;e is, that it is &s;eated in the fat; therefore evacuations which de|&s;troyed it, mu&s;t, in his opinion, contri|bute greatly to the cure of this di&s;order; for which rea&s;on the Doctor recommended the mo&s;t powerful &s;udorifics and purga|tives, the former of which though hurt|ful, are le&s;s prejudicial to the con&s;titution than the latter.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>A&s;truc,</HI> a celebrated writer, has given a very &s;en&s;ible and accurate de&s;cription of the <HI>Lues Venerea</HI> in all its &s;tages, with di|rections for its cure; but the remedies are as violent as tho&s;e recommended by pre|ceding writers, and ought therefore to be exploded.</P>

<P>Baron <HI>Van Swieten</HI> recommends <HI>The Cor|ro&s;ive Sublimate</HI> to be given internally.

Even when admini|&s;tered in rum or brandy, to correct it, the &s;tomach can &s;eldom retain it, for which rea&s;on it has grown into di&s;repute, although it has a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and rapid effect in removing venereal &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Mr. Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Plenk</HI> advi&s;es the giving <HI>Quick&s;ilver with gum arabic,</HI> to prevent it from exciting a &s;alivation. This is the lea&s;t prejudicial of all the modes of admini|&s;tering mercury internally.</P>

<HEAD>A CRITICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE OPERATION OF MERCURY, AND THE DIFFERENT Modes of admini&s;tering it con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>DIFFERENCE of opinion prevails with regard to the mode of admini|&s;tering mercurial preparations; the advo|cates for each, giving their rea&s;ons for that which they adopt in preference to any other. The <HI>alterative</HI> method is much in e&s;teem and practice, and with &s;ome devia|tion and caution may be rendered very beneficial.</P>
<P>This appellation of <HI>alterant or alterative is given to all &s;uch medicines as correct the
<PB N="30" REF="27">bad qualities of the blood, and other animal fluids, without occa&s;ioning any &s;en&s;ible evacu|ation.</HI> According to Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> all that is commonly alledged concerning the change of principles or ferments of di&s;|ea&s;es by alterant remedies, is merely chi|merical and imaginary; he remarks, that there is no change made to the advantage of the human body without a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive renovation and di&s;charge of what is hurtful, and a &s;upply of its place by &s;omething in|nocent.</P>
<P>The Doctor gives the preference to eva|cuants, as being the only medicines ca|pable of freeing the machine from whatever incommodes it. Some take a contrary cour&s;e, and a&s;cribe even the &s;alutary ef|fects of evacuants to their alterative nature, which has been alledged of mercury in the cure of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. Among alte|rant medicines there are &s;everal which change the &s;cene of the &s;ymptoms, and others which &s;u&s;pend the action of the mor|bific matter for a time; but the&s;e reme|dies which hold the morbific principles captive pro tempo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, are only palliatives, and even on &s;ome accounts dangerous, &s;ince they may as well captivate other prin|ciples nece&s;&s;ary to li&s;e.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="28">
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> &s;ays, "Whatever prepara|tion we employ, we &s;hould give it in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch a do&s;e as to pro|duce hardne&s;s, fullne&s;s, and moderate fre|quency of the pul&s;e, with as little &s;en&s;ible evacuation as po&s;&s;ible; for that the mercury cures &s;ooner and with greater certainty, when the &s;trength is but little, than when it is much reduced by it."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Plenck</HI> is of opinion, "that mer|cury, together with the venereal virus, may be more conveniently and more ea&s;ily evacuated by the ordinary excretions of &s;weat, &s;tool, and urine."</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me much more &s;afe to per|mit the gradual evacuation of mercury (after it has circulated &s;ome time, and &s;ub|dued the virus) than to confine it within the body by opiates, or other means, &s;o as to oc|ca&s;ion hardne&s;s, fullne&s;s, and acceleration of the pul&s;e. The &s;aturation or &s;urcharge of the &s;y&s;tem with mercury is very ha|zardous, as it &s;ometimes terminates in a fatal diarrhaea. Surely it is mo&s;t prudent to permit a little of the mercury to depart, and throw into the circulation &s;uch a pro|portion only, as may be altogether &s;afe and
<PB N="32" REF="29">yet &s;ufficient to keep up a gentle mercurial &s;timulus in the habit.</P>
<P>Mercury and wine operate &s;omewhat alike upon the body. With a certain quantity of wine, hardne&s;s, fullne&s;s, and acceleration of the pul&s;e will &s;upervene, till at length in common an evacuation takes place; when it does not, and the wine is retained there, (like mercury ex|hibited as an alterative), it excites feveri&s;h heat, and does the con&s;titution much more injury than when it pa&s;&s;es off gradually by any of the ordinary evacuations.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fordyce</HI> ob&s;erves, "it is never ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alivate a patient, unle&s;s he be &s;o irritable, that the &s;malle&s;t do&s;e of mercury immediately affects his mouth, or unle&s;s the di&s;ea&s;e be proceeding &s;o fa&s;t that it would be hazardous to wait till it was checked by the remedy given in &s;uch a manner as to avoid &s;alivation; or except|ing when we cannot tru&s;t to his u&s;ing it regularly. On the contrary, &s;alivation ren|ders the effects of the medicine uncertain." The &s;ame author &s;ays, "If, notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e precautions, a &s;alivation &s;hould come on, we know of no remedy which will remove it with any degree of certainty,
<PB N="33" REF="30">although &s;ulphur, camphire, and purga|tives have been recommended for this pur|po&s;e. If therefore the ca&s;e be urgent, the be&s;t way is to let it go on, u&s;ing the mer|curial ointment as above de&s;cribed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Saunders</HI> &s;ays he has known patients who have had violent fevers excited by mercury in the form of unction.
<P>The &s;ame author remarks, that a gentleman who had recour&s;e to mercurial unction, being &s;eized with a fever, &s;ent for him, and communicated to him his venercal com|plaints. His pul&s;e was quick and hard, he complained of pain in his back, headach, thir&s;t, and other &s;uch &s;ymp|toms as he had frequently &s;een ari&s;e from a mercurial cour&s;e, conducted on the plan here pre&s;cribed."</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cullen</HI> ob&s;erves,&mdash;that purging is never excited by any means, without &s;pa&s;ms of the inte&s;tines, which, when the operation is continued, are apt to end in du|rable &s;pa&s;m and inflammation. The&s;e are attended with very dangerous con&s;equences. Neither does the method of purging by unction an&s;wer much better (although per|haps more effectual), becau&s;e it is attended with very great pain.&mdash;<HI>Lectures on Materia medica.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>I have ever found tho&s;e patients more ea&s;ily cured, who were mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of the mercurial &s;timulus. Let there be an affection of the mouth and cheeks, and an amendment of the complaint takes place at lea&s;t nine times in ten; the mercury will run off in general very &s;oon if the proce&s;s is di&s;continued, which it mu&s;t not be, but the tenderne&s;s of the mouth is to be kept
<PB N="34" REF="31">up to a certain degree, according to the urgency of the di&s;order, and to prevent a relap&s;e, e&s;pecially in chancres with hard|ne&s;s, and in other inveterate ca&s;es. It is not the mere quantity of mercury, but the method of directing its operation, which in my opinion is the chief circum&s;tance to be relied on in the cure. I would certainly run the ri&s;k, if there was any, of <HI>not imme|diately curing,</HI> rather than expo&s;e my pa|tient to the hazard of a large quantity of accumulated mercury ready at an hour's notice, or le&s;s, to emancipate it&s;elf from the body by &s;timulating the inte&s;tines, and thus exhau&s;ting li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>We may be amu&s;ed with the theory of mercury circulating in the &s;y&s;tem in perfect equilibrium, not inclining more to one &s;e|cretion than to another; but it is certain, this is a powerful medicine that ought not to be trifled with; we cannot &s;ay to it&mdash;So far &s;halt thou go, and no further. The mo&s;t &s;kilful pilot will find it difficult &s;o to trim his ve&s;&s;el that it &s;hall not &s;ink or over|turn when too heavily laden with mercury.</P>
<P>The ingenious <HI>Plenck,</HI> (to whom the world is &s;o much indebted for the great im|provements he has made by his experi|ments on mercury, and in the cure of this
<PB N="35" REF="32">di&s;ea&s;e) &s;ays, that a &s;alivation is a danger|ous practice; for the famous <HI>A&s;truc,</HI> &s;ays he, a&s;&s;erts that there frequently &s;upervene, violent fevers, diarrhaea, dy&s;entery, hae|moptoe, an immobility of the jaws, and likewi&s;e a &s;uffocation, and that too, when a &s;alivation has been mo&s;t properly con|ducted; and after him the mo&s;t &s;kilful <HI>Locher</HI> tells us the &s;ame.&mdash;</P>
<P>Several years &s;ince a practitioner had the misfortune to lo&s;e (within a &s;hort time of each other) two patients with chancres, for the cure of which he had rai&s;ed very high &s;alivations by mercurial ointment. Ju&s;t as their complaints were healed, and &s;alivation began to decline, one of the gentlemen was &s;eized with a dy&s;enteric flux, and expired within a few hours: his death was attributed to a piece of butter which the nur&s;e had inadvertently put into his gruel. The other died al&s;o of a flux, ari&s;ing from the &s;udden de&s;cent of the mer|cury overturning the equilibrium, and ru&s;h|ing through the patient's bowels with irre|&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity.&mdash;</P>
<P>To form a ju&s;t idea of a &s;alivation, we &s;hould perambulate the public ho&s;pitals, where there are wretches mi&s;erable indeed!
<PB N="36" REF="33">mi&s;erable in having a &s;ad di&s;ea&s;e, but much more &s;o in having a cure to encounter which makes the unhappy objects call on death for a deliverance from their pains. Their head, face, and tongue &s;o &s;welled, as to forbid their uttering a &s;yllable. Their cheeks often torn to pieces, a &s;alivary flux of two or three quarts a day, with breath extremely offen&s;ive, teeth loo&s;e, tongue and gums ulcerated and inflamed, attended with a &s;evere unremitting head-ach; and this proce&s;s is the &s;ame in all ca&s;es and &s;ea&s;ons: it may truly be &s;aid, &s;uch remedies are wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;es they are intended to remove. But this is not all the pa|tient has to undergo; add to this, fre|quent &s;evere cholicky pains, accompa|nied with diarrhaea and dy&s;entery, which continuing, &s;o often prove fatal. The patient can &s;wallow no &s;olid food during this &s;evere operation, and indeed &s;carcely liquids, and is almo&s;t dead with hunger, having often an appetite without the po&s;|&s;ibility of indulging it. Thus are per|&s;ons confined for &s;everal weeks, and when the proce&s;s is fini&s;hed, they are &s;o re|duced in fle&s;h, as to be quite a &s;pectacle, and frequently go into a deep decline.&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="34">If the&s;e evils may be prevented, and that they may, we have daily experience added to the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timonies, are we not all called upon by every motive of con|&s;cience, religion, and humanity, to pre&s;erve the unhappy from ruin, by rejecting &s;o cruel a practice?</P>

<P>If the &s;urgeons who &s;uperintend the ho&s;|pitals would make a trial of my me|thod, I am convinced from experience, they would be able, without annoying the &s;tomach, to convey any quantity of any mercurial preparation into the &s;y&s;tem in few hours, in&s;tead of weeks. This may be done by rubbing mercury on the back and middle of the tongue, and repeating the proce&s;s at the &s;horte&s;t intervals. There is no occa&s;ion to wait for its operation as in the ca&s;e of pills, but we may &s;afely &s;timu|late the&s;e &s;urfaces as much and as often as we chu&s;e, till we have actually produced the de&s;ired effect on the &s;y&s;tem. Let the mouth be well cleared of the &s;aliva, and I know of no other impediment to the &s;ucce&s;s of this proce&s;s. Dr. <HI>Home,</HI> profe&s;|&s;or of phy&s;ic at Edinburgh, has honoured me by making a variety of public experi|ments
<PB N="38" REF="35">in the Edingburgh Infirmary, which will &s;oon appear in the Doctor's intended publication. By the&s;e experiments it is proved, that mercury is more quickly in|troduced, with greater certainty, and with le&s;s prejudice to the con&s;titution in this way, than by any of the other modes of admini|&s;tering it internally or externally.</P>

<P>WITH re&s;pect to Pills, it is certain that many patients find a difficulty in taking them.

<P>Dr. <HI>Krohn</HI> on this &s;ubject &s;ays, "this mode agrees better with people who are debauchees, having had e&s;&s;ential proof of this a&s;&s;ertion in a patient who drank all kinds of &s;trong liquors, was &s;carcely ever in bed for a week together, till break of day, and was much expo&s;ed to cold damp air."</P>

<HEAD>A Recapitulation of Objections to the common Methods of admini&s;tering <HI>MERCURY,</HI> accompanied with &s;ome new Ob&s;ervations, and conveying a &s;hort and pointed View of the Whole.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Lues</HI> is a venereal infection in the ma&s;s of blood; and is to be cured by throwing a &s;ufficient quantity of mercury into the &s;y&s;tem to expel it.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="42">
<P>There are many ways of conveying mer|cury into the circulation of the blood.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual methods are by pills, bo|lu&s;es, and draughts, and al&s;o by outward application of mercurial ointment.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t three are conveyed by the mouth into the &s;tomach, where the mer|curial particles are in part ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of that organ, and conveyed into the blood; al&s;o by the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els in the inte&s;tines, and frequently the greate&s;t portion of the mercury e&s;capes out of the body by this outlet, having fir&s;t irri|tated the animal oeconomy throughout the whole of the canal.</P>
<P>Mercury may be prevented from pa&s;&s;ing downwards by joining <HI>opium</HI> with it, which takes off its &s;timulus, and generally pre|vents its purgative effects; but this often creates &s;ickne&s;s and reaching, and &s;hakes the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Two grains of mercury taken up into the blood by the mouth, will produce as power|ful an effect on the &s;y&s;tem, as twenty grains thrown into the &s;tomach, on the pre|&s;umption that eighteen of the twenty make their exit downwards: we reckon only what gets into the &s;y&s;tem, for what pa&s;|&s;es through, <HI>is lo&s;t,</HI> and certainly better
<PB N="46" REF="43">had never been given. The &s;tomach re|&s;embles a &s;ink with a grate in it, and is not con&s;tructed to retain mercury.</P>
<P>Mercurial ointment cures by being taken up into the blood by the ab&s;orbents of the external &s;kin, and when introduced there, by operating on the whole va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, and expelling the venereal poi&s;on by the different &s;ecretions and excretions of the body.</P>
<P>The objections to this mode of practice are, Fir&s;t, that it is dirty and di&s;agreeable; that it is commonly &s;low and tedious: that it requires too much labour for per&s;ons in a weak &s;tate, and if the friction is per|formed by other hands than their own, that one half of the ointment, or more, mu&s;t in|fallibly be lo&s;t to the patient, and may prove very injurious to the party who ap|plies it.</P>
<P>Mercurial ointment affects the &s;tomach or bowels, and brings on purging; in&s;o|much that it is not uncommon for patients, both in public and private practice, to die under a cour&s;e of unction, of violent cho|lies, accompanied by &s;anguinary and other fluxes, and this happens by the quantity of mercury ab&s;orbed proving an overbalance for the con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="44">
<P>Practitioners do not accurately know what quantity of mercury may be given, and what quantity of it will take effect, as different con&s;titutions require different do&s;es. Five grains of mercurial ointment will take more effect on one &s;ubject, than fifty on another; after u&s;ing it ten or fifteen days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, no vi&s;ible effect may be pro|duced on the con&s;titution; yet, on the eighteenth or twentieth, a &s;alivary flux may commence, and continue for a fortnight or three weeks, and the patient's &s;trength become exhau&s;ted. At this juncture &s;hould a diarrhaea unfortunately take place, it carries off the patient in a few hours, not|with&s;tanding all the endeavours of the mo&s;t &s;kilful of the faculty.</P>
<P>I have made u&s;e of &s;uch arguments as have occurred to me in behalf of this new method, and have advanced nothing but what my repeated experience doth fully warrant. If the ideas of other practitioners do not coincide with mine, I &s;hall be happy to &s;ee their avowed and printed &s;en|timents on this important &s;ubject, dive&s;ted of prejudice and delivered with candour.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;&s;erted that this method &s;ometimes fails, let not that declaration pre|vent the trying it, as this may be urged
<PB N="48" REF="45">again&s;t all medical practice, and often, no doubt, with the greate&s;t inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that this proce&s;s, by &s;horten|ing the cure and le&s;&s;ening the medicines, will dimini&s;h the fee. The profe&s;&s;ion need not object to it on that account, as they are paid, not for their medicine, this being no object, but for their &s;kill and judge|ment. Patients of liberal di&s;po&s;itions will always be plea&s;ed with di&s;patch and make a hand&s;ome return: and others will find their intere&s;t al&s;o in behaving in the &s;ame equi|table manner.</P>
