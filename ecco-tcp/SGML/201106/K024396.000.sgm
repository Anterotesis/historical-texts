<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Publi&s;h'd an E&s;&s;ay on this Subject the la&s;t Year; upon which &s;ome of the Faculty were pleas'd to pa&s;s this Judgment, That it was only written on purpo&s;e to dimini&s;h the Practice of the Phy&s;icians and Apothecaries in Town.</P>
<P>I here declare, That it was not written with that De&s;ign; tho' if it had, I believe it would not have been the le&s;s e&s;teem'd by mo&s;t Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I have u&s;ed in that Piece all De|ference and Re&s;pect to the Good and Worthy Practi&s;ers of Phy&s;ick at lea&s;t: And if by Accident it may prove de|trimental to the re&s;t of the Faculty, or tho&s;e that depend upon it, or rather (to
<PB REF="3">take it in a right Sen&s;e) whom tho&s;e latter Gentlemen are too much depend|ing upon, it ought not, I pre&s;ume, to be reckon'd as a Fault of mine.</P>
<P>The Reo&s;ons and De&s;ign of that Piece I have deliver'd very plainly in my Preface to it; and how far &s;uiting to &s;uch a De&s;ign the Work it &s;elf was, is given in the Judgment of tho&s;e two very <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Unprejudic'd</HI> Per|&s;ons I have mention'd towards the lat|ter End of this.</P>
<P>The Fault, as I am inform'd, of that other Piece, was, in my not being open and plain enough: But from hencefor|ward I &s;hall be more free in declaring my own, and others Sentiments, upon this Subject; of which I here give the Reader the following &s;hort Specimen.</P>

<HEAD>SOME REFLECTIONS UPON THE <HI>Modern Practi&s;ers of Phy&s;ick,</HI> In Relation to the SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_SYDENHAM</HI>
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sydenham</HI> was both a great Admirer and Follower of <HI>Hippocrates.</HI> The fir&s;t is mo&s;t apparent in tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages of his Preface, where he tells us, <HI>That</HI> Hippocrates, <HI>who arriv'd to the Top of Phy&s;ick, laid the &s;olid Foundation upon</HI> Nature cures Di&s;ea&s;es. And again, <HI>'Tis from the Anci|ents, and chiefly</HI> Hippocrates, <HI>we have receiv'd the be&s;t part of the</HI> Therapeuticks; that is [the Art of admini&s;tring to, or healing of the Sick:] So that both the true Theory and Practice of Phy&s;ick was chiefly this great Writer's, in <HI>Sydenham</HI>'s Opinion; and &s;till more &s;o, I judge, in his we are going to recount.</NOTE> was a great Admirer of <HI>Hippocrates;</HI> ne|verthele&s;s, we mu&s;t not al|low him to have been either the clo&s;e&s;t, or the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful Follower of him; as will appear by the follow|ing Account I &s;hall give of one that was his
<PB N="2" REF="5">great Crony and Cotemporary; I mean the good Dr. <HI>Mapletoft.</HI> I had Occa&s;ion to wait upon this Reverend, and very Venerable Per|&s;on the la&s;t Year, and to di&s;cour&s;e with him &s;omething about the Small Pox, which was no uncommon Subject then, nor now, in <HI>London.</HI> He told me, That <HI>he once thought he under&s;tood that Di&s;temper him&s;elf;</HI> for <HI>in Six Years that he was a Practi&s;er</HI> (of con&s;iderable
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">He was Pre&s;ident of the <HI>College of Phy&s;icians.</HI></NOTE> Emi|nence in <HI>London</HI>) <HI>he lo&s;t not one Patient by the Small Pox.</HI> At length, he &s;aid, two or three died under his Hands; which (tho' there were other Phy&s;icians, whom he nam'd, em|ploy'd with him in tho&s;e Patients) it gave him that Concern, as to ha&s;ten the leaving off his Practice of Phy&s;ick; which was gain|ful enough to him, being better worth than a Thou&s;and Pounds a Year, as he a&s;&s;ur'd me; and which he did not probably expect the &s;ame Profit from his Pains in Divinity, to which Calling neverthele&s;s he &s;aid he had a greater Inclination than to the other: and during his Employment in Phy&s;ick, was as con&s;tant in Publick Acts of Devotion as &s;ince.</P>
<P>This whole Relation was very much &s;ur|pri&s;ing to me; e&s;pecially from one of his Character: The perfect Veracity of who&s;e Words I could no ways &s;cruple or make a Doubt of. And it gave me Occa&s;ion to en|quire of him, what were his Ways or Me|thods in the Cure of the Small Pox. He ve|ry
<PB N="3" REF="6">frankly told me, That his general Way, was to do nothing at all; That a Patient of his, when his Apothecary's Bill was brought in, it came but to Three Pence; another's, (which was accidently view'd by him at the &s;ame Time,) amounting to Ten Pounds: that Per&s;on died. This la&s;t Account was not al|together &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing. But that the Doctor's good Succe&s;s &s;hould continue for &s;o many Years, when 'tis probable there were diffe|rent Sea&s;ons and Con&s;titutions of tho&s;e Years, and &s;ome more dangerous than others to this Di&s;temper, as well as has been &s;ince; that the Doctor's Method, the &s;ame I pre&s;ume with <HI>Hippocrates's, viz.</HI> a proper
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Diet was the fir&s;t, the principal, and oftentimes the only Remedy, that <HI>Hippocrates</HI> made u&s;e of, to &s;ati&s;|fie the greate&s;t part of the Intentions we have touch'd upon. By the&s;e means he oppos'd moi&s;&s; to dry; hot to cold: He added or &s;upply'd what was deficient; and took off from what was &s;uperfluous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that that was to him the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Point he &s;upported Na|ture, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted it to overcome the Cau&s;e of the Mala|dy&punc; and in a word, put it in a Condition to do of it &s;elf what was nece&s;&s;ary for the Cure of Di&s;tempers, &s;ays <HI>Le Clark,</HI> p. 273. of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ick;</HI> and 'tis confirm'd in <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Books <HI>De Morbis,</HI> and in his <HI>Epidemicks,</HI> which were his Practice.</NOTE> Diet pre|&s;crib'd, and a Regulation in the other
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The Non-Naturals are Diet, Air, Sleeping or Watching, Evacuation or Retention of Excrements, Exerci&s;e or Re&s;t, and Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind.</NOTE> Non-Naturals, &s;hould &s;o infallibly &s;ucceed, when a Multitude of Medicines then and &s;ince given by others has prov'd either inef|fectual, noxious, or deadly, de&s;erves a tho|rough Con&s;ideration: And before my Depar|ture
<PB N="4" REF="7">I could not forbear telling the Doctor my Sentiments, That the Practice of the Town &s;eem'd to be far different from his. He confe&s;s'd it was &s;o; and that the Phy&s;i|cians now made u&s;e of Bleeding, Bli&s;tering, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which, they told him, they &s;av'd the Lives of many. I an&s;wer'd him, that I thought Matter of Fact was too plainly a|gain&s;t their Practice; and if they &s;av'd the Lives of many, they de&s;troy'd far more.</P>
<P>To all this, and likewi&s;e what <HI>Sydenham</HI> mentions concerning the Poor's generally e&s;caping well in this Di&s;temper, there can be, I think, but one plau&s;ible An&s;wer given: which tho' it may be &s;o to this latter of <HI>Sy|denham</HI>'s, yet can &s;carce be allow'd to the foregoing. 'Tis this; That whoever con|cerns him&s;elf with Phy&s;ick, ought always to con&s;ider, that there is a very great difference in the Con&s;titutions of mo&s;t Per&s;ons, which makes the very &s;ame Di&s;temper &s;evere and dangerous to one, yet mild and very ea&s;y to to be born in another: that nothing appears more plainly than this Ob&s;ervation in the Small Pox. And from hence we are told, we ought to infer for a generat Rea&s;on, why the Poor, who u&s;e little or no Phy&s;ick in this Di&s;temper, yet commonly e&s;cape well in it: That it is from the lowne&s;s of their Diet, and their different ways of Living from the Rich; which cau&s;es their Bodies to be of another Nature, and not liable to the Virulency, or high Malignity of the Di|&s;ea&s;e: But the Rich are &s;ubject to it, and
<PB N="5" REF="8">therefore they mu&s;t u&s;e Means, and all the Powers of Art to quell, le&s;&s;en and de&s;troy it in their Bodies, or to prevent it. And after all that can be done for them, if great Num|bers of the&s;e latter mi&s;carry in the Hands of their Phy&s;icians, notwith&s;tanding their ut|mo&s;t Care and Medicines, 'tis not to be im|puted to their Fault: for they cannot alter Nature &s;o very &s;peedily, and create a good and &s;trong Con&s;titution or Habit of Body, where it was not at all to be found in the Patient before. This has pa&s;s'd, with ma|ny, for a good An&s;wer to what <HI>Sydenham</HI> has &s;aid, relating to the Poor's e&s;caping better than the Rich, tho' they us'd no Phy|&s;ick, nor Methods of Art in the Small Pox; but will not &s;erve, I think, to what Dr. <HI>Ma|pletoft</HI>'s con&s;tant Practice prov'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that the &s;ame Methods being us'd to both, were &s;ucce&s;sful alike; except we &s;uppo&s;e he had no Rich Patients: which, after what I have but now related of him, 'twere a mere Ab|&s;urdity to imagine.</P>
<P>This therefore is &s;ome Proof of what I hinted at in my Title-page and Preface; but &s;hall make out more fully in a larger Piece concerning Phy&s;ick's being grown in this Age too much an Art or Craft, it being us'd too much, and not to a right Intention, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t I &s;hould be any ways mi&s;taken, in either the receiving, or delivering of the&s;e Matters; or I may &s;eem to my Reader
<PB N="6" REF="9">to have over-weighted them with Con&s;e|quences, which, in his Opinion, they will not &s;o very well bear, I &s;hall go on; and take a View of the other part of <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Practice, in the Exceptions again&s;t his gene|ral Rule of Diet only. For &s;o we may pro|perly call them; Exceptions; being but few, and not to be met with in many Pages of his Works, e&s;pecially of his Practice. 'Tis cer|tain however, that he made u&s;e both of Eva|cuations, and other Means or Medicines, in Acute and Chronical Di&s;tempers: tho' not near &s;o often in the former, as the latter: Nature being generally better able, of her &s;elf, to bring Matters to a Cri&s;is without them. I de&s;ign to con&s;ider &s;everal of the&s;e, but at pre&s;ent can only go upon one of them, without &s;welling this Piece to too large a Bulk: But 'tis pretty material, namely, the Evacuation of Bleeding; to &s;ee upon what Rea&s;ons or Tokens (&s;carcely upon &s;light ones) <HI>Hippocrates</HI> made u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Indication in him, taken notice of by a certain Author
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Le Clarke.</NOTE>, who has under|taken to put them in Order, is a Plethora, or over-fulne&s;s of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, in which Ca&s;e, he u&s;ed Bleeding to evacuate, or take away the Superfuity of what was in them.</P>
<P>This I own is highly requi&s;ite, where the Ca&s;e by certain or very numerous Indicati|ons, is manife&s;t. But where not, 'tis as in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to let alone or omit it: for by Bleeding we mo&s;t certainly weak|en
<PB N="7" REF="10">Nature, if we do not relieve her. Nay, tho we do, as is mo&s;t certainly known in ma|ny Ca&s;es, and ought to be well noted in Di|&s;tempers that are both long and violent, as this we are now treating of, at pre&s;ent mo&s;t commonly is.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay &s;ome of our Modern Practi&s;ers in defence of their own Ways and Methods, tho' not &s;ucce&s;sful; The Gentry or rich Per&s;ons who have Plenty of every thing, are apt to indulge them&s;elves to exce&s;s, and &s;o mu&s;t needs be full of Blood and Humours, which renders Evacuations nece&s;&s;ary to them.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;ertion I hold to contain very con|&s;iderable Fal&s;ities; and to be mo&s;t pernicious in its Con&s;equences, as I &s;hall make appear both by Rea&s;ons and Facts them&s;elves. And for that purpo&s;e, &s;hall enter upon a brief Con&s;ideration and Account of the general ways of living, both of the Rich and Poorer Sort, and what are the common Diet and Delights of both.</P>
<P>The common Diet both of tho&s;e who&s;e Circum&s;tances are good and plentiful, as al&s;o of almo&s;t the meane&s;t Mechanick here in <HI>London,</HI> is Butchers Meat, little differently dre&s;s'd, excepting &s;ome few, who delight in made Di&s;hes, Sauces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but neither in this nor in the variety of Cour&s;es, do the Gene|rality of Wealthy Per&s;ons exceed tho&s;e of the Poorer, or Commonalty, who dine at the
<PB N="8" REF="11">Cooks Shops in <HI>London.</HI> This then can make no great Difference in their Con&s;titutions, either for good or bad. We &s;hall de&s;cend therefore to the <HI>Deliciae,</HI> the Entertainments of the Gentry, or richer Sort, among&s;t one another. In this there is a con&s;iderable Dif|ference and Di&s;tinction of them from the meaner &s;ort. The Entertainments of the Fir&s;t, where they give any in their Vi&s;its, being with Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, a Cup of Cordial Waters, or a &s;ingle Gla&s;s of Wine, and the like. Now whoever con&s;iders the&s;e, and compares them with the good roa&s;t Beef, Ale and Chee&s;e which the meaner &s;ort, both in City and Country, are apt to &s;et be|fore their Friends or Vi&s;itors at all Hours, will think, there is no Compari&s;on in the Sub&s;tantialne&s;s of the Treat, and that the latter is much more likely to fill the Body with Blood and Humours, than the former. For to con&s;ider of Coffee, 'tis a noted Dry|er up of the Blood and Humours; of Tea, the Green fir&s;t, 'tis an Evacuator both by U|rine and Sweat; this la&s;t by its own Heat, and by being drank in a fa&s;hionable manner, that is, in large Quantities and exce&s;&s;ive hot. The Bohea Tea is &s;omething of another Na|ture, being reckon'd good in Con&s;umptions by many: Yet no Per&s;on that I have met with, has complain'd of their growing too gro&s;s, bulky, or Plethorick by feeding on it, or that it put too much Blood in their Faces, as is the Complexion of tho&s;e who too much abound with it. This might make it become altogether an unfa&s;hionable Liquor, which I
<PB N="9" REF="12">do not hear that it is at lea&s;t upon this ac|count.</P>
<P>The third thing I have mention'd is, Cho|colate; which tho' not &s;o often us'd in Vi&s;its, is yet drank con&s;tantly by many; and this to be &s;ure will be reckon'd an high Diet; Yet I cannot find, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who take it (even in Bed, which way it &s;hould be mo&s;t nouri&s;hing) are obliged to make u&s;e of any Evacuations, as bleeding, purging, vomit|ing once a Month, or Quarter, upon that account.</P>
<P>I need not mention the Nature or Effects of the other two Liquors, which People of Fa&s;hion and Sobriety, e&s;pecially the Ladies, tho' they may ta&s;te of, yet we mu&s;t believe 'tis &s;paringly enough. And as for tho&s;e Gen|lemen, who make too free with their own Con&s;titutions by an over-liberal U&s;e of Wine and other Liquors, this does not always ren|der them Plethorick, or too abounding with Blood, Spirits and Humours in their Veins and Nerves: &s;uch Per&s;ons rather wanting them, and even a natural Heat in their Bo|dies upon any Intermi&s;&s;ion of their u&s;ual Debauch. To the&s;e the greate&s;t
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t not be taken to extend to an acciden|tal Debauch or Exce&s;s, where it is not cu&s;tomary in young Per&s;ons; for in the&s;e latter the Blood is apt to &s;well and boyl up upon it, which may endanger bur&s;t|ing of the Ve&s;&s;els. In this Ca&s;e we mu&s;t u&s;e Bleeding, tho' with Caution.</NOTE> Caution
<PB N="10" REF="13">therefore ought to be us'd, how we too much impair their Spirits by any Exhau&s;tion; when nothing but even a Riot can repair them again; &s;o much is Cu&s;tom a &s;econd Nature, and as hardly to be put off as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are but &s;hort Hints, which might be clear'd and enlarg'd upon very much: but &s;uch as they are at pre&s;ent, they are e|nough to &s;hew, That this Suppo&s;al of a Ple|thora, or fulne&s;s of Blood in rich Per&s;ons, rather than in the poor, or middle &s;ort, has no good Foundation. And another thing that may plainly convince us of this Mi&s;take is, the very Countenances, as well as Shape of Body, of &s;uch as live nicely and delicately in the City, compar'd with tho&s;e who live more hardily and in the Country: For in the fir&s;t 'tis thin, pale, and without Colour; but in the other Sanguine and full: which made one of our be&s;t Poets, when he brings in two City-Ladies ridiculing the Country-Gentle|man's ill-bred Daughters, to mention their being
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Congreve's Old Batchelor,</HI> Act 4. Scene 3.</NOTE> <HI>Plump, Cherry-Cheek'd, and Fat as Barn-Door-Fowl:</HI> which none doubts was na|turally, tho' &s;atyrically expre&s;s'd in him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall go not much farther, nor u&s;e many more Arguments at pre&s;ent in this thing; being not &s;o far &s;way'd in my own Judgment and Opinion, (tho' grounded upon Rea&s;on
<PB N="11" REF="14">and Ob&s;ervation) as to disbelieve there are any Plethorick Per&s;ons at all among&s;t the Rich; who may need Evacuations in the very beginning of this, as well as other Di|&s;tempers: but I am nearly of Opinion, that there may at lea&s;t as many be found among the poorer or middle &s;ort of People, and of &s;uch as live upon a plainer Diet too, than any I have yet mention'd. I &s;hall give the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>There was, &s;ome Years &s;ince, living in <HI>Cother&s;tock,</HI> near <HI>Oundle</HI> in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> a Family of the <HI>Whiteings,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the Grandmother, three Grand&s;ons and a Daugh|ter. The four young Per&s;ons were pretty well grown up, when the elde&s;t of them, a|bout Nineteen, and a very lu&s;ty Youth, fre&s;h and &s;anguine, fell ill of a Cold or Cough only; which being neglected, pre&s;ently turn'd to a Con&s;umption. Advice was at length call'd for him, when it was too late; but who gave it as their Opinion, That if he had been let Blood early enough, when he had only a Cough, and not a Con&s;um|ption, or wa&s;ting of the Lungs and other Parts, he had avoided this fatal Di&s;temper; which, in a &s;hort Time, carried him off.</P>
<P>About a Year after the &s;econd Brother, of much the &s;ome Habit of Body, and not yet quite at his full Growth, fell ill of the Small Pox, and was taken with an inward Bleed|ing, before the Di&s;temper well appear'd; which carried him off &s;peedily. The third
<PB N="12" REF="15">Brother caught them of this la&s;t; and with the &s;ame Symptoms, <HI>viz.</HI> voiding bloody Urine, died likewi&s;e. Whil&s;t he was yet unburied, the only now &s;urviving Child, the Grand-daughter, of a clear, florid, and &s;ome|thing &s;anguine Complexion, fell ill: and her they got pre&s;ently blooded in the Arm; notwith&s;tanding which, &s;he had a mo&s;t violent [Haemorrhage, or] Bleeding at the No&s;e; which la&s;ted &s;o long, till her Friends about her thought &s;he would have expir'd by it; they having try'd &s;everal Things in vain to &s;top it. At length they bethought them&s;elves of a very good Blood&s;tone; which being apply'd, the Bleeding imme|diately &s;taid. The Small Pox however, not|with&s;tanding this (one would think) cooling of the Blood by emptying, prov'd of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t confluent Kind; yet &s;he e&s;caped with great Difficulty, and is alive at this Day.</P>
<P>What I introduc'd the&s;e Examples for, is to &s;hew, that Per&s;ons either of a mean E|&s;tate, or that live almo&s;t as frugally as po&s;&s;i|ble, may be over full of Blood and Hu|mours. The Grandmother of the&s;e Per&s;ons, who was Manager and Provider of the Fa|mily, being noted for her Par&s;imonious Tem|per; and tho', I &s;uppo&s;e, the Hou&s;e did not want for Nece&s;&s;aries, having Means to pro|vide them, yet &s;he allowed very little Su|perfluities either to her &s;elf, or Grand-chil|dren; their Diets being both plain and com|mon. And as for tho&s;e Refre&s;hments of
<PB N="13" REF="16">Coffee, Tea, Chocolate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they were &s;carce at that time known in the Family, no more than Wine or Brandy, commonly us'd or permitted in it; yet the&s;e Per&s;ons &s;eem'd manife&s;tly Plethorick in their Con|&s;titutions, as I have &s;hew'd; and perhaps they were the more inclin'd to be &s;o, for living after their plain manner, and upon a low Diet. For I remember, that commu|nicating the&s;e Ca&s;es, and &s;ome others, to an old Phy&s;ician of my Acquaintance, he ask'd me if the foremention'd Per&s;ons fed upon a Milk-Diet. I told him, I could not directly affirm that was their con&s;tant Food: But that the Family kept a Dairy, and I &s;uppos'd it might be a con&s;iderable part of it. This Phy&s;ician told me, the Rea&s;on of his asking was, that he had ob&s;erv'd Per&s;ons who vo|luntarily cho&s;e a Milk-Diet, and liv'd upon it, were generally more turgid and fuller fle&s;h'd than others: which we may common|ly ob&s;erve of the poorer &s;ort, who are not over-labour'd, and e&s;pecially of their Chil|dren.</P>
<P>Another common Diet of the meaner &s;ort is Chee&s;e, which tho' reckon'd by &s;ome not to be a nouri&s;hing nor good Food, yet has been reputed otherwi&s;e by the mo&s;t judi|cious. For we find there were &s;o long &s;ince as in <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Days, various Opinions a|bout this Edible, as to the Wholefomne&s;s or Unwhole&s;omne&s;s of it: which in one Place he ridicules, as only given by ignorant Peo|ple at random, without con&s;idering the diffe|rent
<PB N="14" REF="17">Con&s;titutions of Per&s;ons, who may feed upon it and find different Effects, <HI>viz.</HI> an A|greeablene&s;s or Di&s;agreeablene&s;s of it. And he tells us, that for many
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">De Veteri Medicina, part. 37.</NOTE> thin and lean Per&s;ons 'tis found good and whole&s;om Food: which argues that it &s;omeways nouri&s;hes, and fills up &s;uch Bodies.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;uppos'd luxuriant and riotous living of the Rich, the Poor or Meaner Sort, both may and do, abound with Blood and other Juices, at lea&s;t as much, or rather more, and as oft|en as the former: and con&s;equently may have as great Occa&s;ion for Bleeding, and o|ther Evacuations, as tho&s;e fir&s;t. But that they do make very &s;eldom any u&s;e of them, e&s;pecially of Bleeding, I am pretty through|ly per&s;uaded; not only from their general and natural abhorrence to it, but a particu|lar one in this Di&s;temper of the Small Pox; which is &s;o great, that I have heard more than one Per&s;on affirm, they would &s;ooner admit a Dagger to their Hearts, than &s;uffer it to be done upon any account in this Di&s;ea&s;e. Yet the&s;e are the &s;ame Per&s;ons that &s;cape the be&s;t, as <HI>Sydenham</HI> ob&s;erves, and &s;uf|fer the fewe&s;t Mi&s;carriages by it.</P>
<P>There is one thing however, which my mo&s;t timorous Readers will be too apt to con|clude from the foregoing particular Ca&s;es
<PB N="15" REF="18">(two of which having prov'd mortal to all appearance for want of this Precaution of Bleeding, before Nature had forc'd her way by the &s;ecret Pa&s;&s;ages) which is that this in|ward Bleeding, being both a very common and dangerous Symptom, we ought to u&s;e a Fence and Precaution again&s;t it; and that nothing is &s;o Good and &s;afe as Bleeding at the Arm. I can agree with &s;uch a Per&s;on in none of the&s;e things. For fir&s;t, were this both a very common and very fatal Sym|ptom, Dr. <HI>Mapletoft</HI> mu&s;t no doubt have often met with it, and not knowing how to cure, would have lo&s;t &s;ome of his Patients by it; which we do not find that he did, or by any other means, of a long time, <HI>viz.</HI> Six whole Years. If he had a certain Remedy for this Symptom, I do not que&s;tion but he would have communicated it to the Publick long e're this; e&s;pecially when he had left off his Practice. If we &s;uppo&s;e he us'd the foremen|tion'd Precaution, and blooded all his Pati|ents in the beginning, the Suppo&s;ition is ve|ry unrea&s;onable; for this is far from doing
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See P. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Nothing.</HI> 'Tis too frequently doing Mi&s;|chief, as I have &s;hewn by &s;ome

<PB N="16" REF="19">
<P>This bad Symptom, as 'tis commonly and truely accounted, &s;eems mo&s;t incident to Per&s;ons of a pretty full, but lax Habit of Bo|dy; who&s;e Fibres have not a true Strength, Tone, and Re&s;i&s;tance, when any thing of Force or Violence is impre&s;s'd upon them. It &s;eems to require too, that their Blood and Humours be not only pretty much abound|ing, but that they &s;hould be of a thin and watery Con&s;i&s;tance. I &s;peak this as not only knowing one of the three Per&s;ons aforemen|tion'd, who had been my Patient, to have been of this Con&s;titution, from certain To|kens plainly di&s;covering both the Solids and Fluids to be &s;o con&s;tituted; but the other two were in outward appearance, and upon this Tryal of the Di&s;temper, as we &s;ee, inwardly affected almo&s;t the &s;ame. The&s;e things, to|gether with another Remark I &s;hall mention by and by, have made me take &s;ome notice of a Reflection Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> has thrown upon <HI>Sydenham,</HI> for his Method of u&s;ing Dilutives, <HI>viz.</HI> Quantities of thin and &s;mall Liquors in this Di&s;temper. He tells us, that this cele|brated Author carried it to an Exce&s;s in that Point, and the Effect of it was, to his Know|ledge, very often a voiding of bloody Urine. Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> was a Per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;iderable Practice, tho' far in&s;erior to <HI>Sydenham,</HI> and upon whom he is too &s;evere in his Reflecti|ons.

<PB N="17" REF="20">Temper into the Mi&s;carriages of others) di&s;cover'd this to him, 'twas very well the di&s;covering it to the World; e&s;pecially when <HI>Sydenham</HI> plainly &s;hews him&s;elf at a lo&s;s upon this Symptom.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay my &s;elf that I have &s;een this Effect upon any one in the Small Pox: but I have &s;een a very &s;udden and apparent Dia|betes, caus'd by a Per&s;on's only drinking a very large Quantity of Small Beer in the Pa|roxi&s;m or Fit of an Ague; which failing to be di&s;charg'd by Vomit, as it had us'd to have been to the &s;ame Per&s;on, pre&s;ently turn'd downwards, and the Patient had at lea&s;t twenty di&s;charges by Urine in le&s;s than twelve Hours: and with &s;uch a Pro&s;tration of Strength and Spirits, that Life &s;eem'd to be in danger, before we could get proper Remedies in a Country-Village; which ne|verthele&s;s this Di&s;temper &s;oon yielded to, when receiv'd; and the Per&s;on recover'd from the Ague and Diabetes, thus acci|dentally attending it, in a very few Days; there being no contrariety in the two Me|thods that I us'd for both. However, I have reflected upon it &s;ince; That if in &s;uch a Di|&s;temper as a common Ague, a Diabetes &s;uc|ceeded, by only thinning the Blood with too much Liquids, as is mention'd; In the Small Pox, which has a much greater Acrimony, the Blood it &s;elf, by corro&s;ion of the Ve&s;&s;els, might be carried down with tho&s;e Liquids the &s;ame way. I am therefore altogether for a Moderation in this, as well as in other
<PB N="18" REF="21">Methods or Admini&s;trations for this Di&s;tem|per, and not for large Quantities of Liquors to be given, except the Patient has been long and injuriou&s;ly detain'd from them, &s;o that the exce&s;&s;ive Heat and Drought of his Body does ab&s;olutely require them: for then only they are both &s;afe and u&s;eful. All this is by way of Precaution only again&s;t this Sym|ptom of inward Bleeding; which, if due Care be taken, I mean, if no violent Me|thods, or ill Regimen has been us'd, in, or immediately before the Di&s;temper, few Per|&s;ons Con&s;titutions, in my Opinion, would make them directly liable to it.</P>
<P>As for the Cure of it, I &s;hall advi&s;e but to a &s;eemingly &s;light and ea&s;y Method at Pre|&s;ent, which was recommended to me by a Lady; one of a very generous and charitable Di&s;po&s;ition, who vi&s;its equally both Rich and Poor in any Di&s;tre&s;s; and in one that her own tender Sex is only lyable to, when &s;he makes a ready Vi&s;it, &s;he tells me, &s;he ne|ver goes unfurni&s;h'd with an Herb call'd <HI>Ro&s;|folis,</HI> or <HI>Sun-dew;</HI> which has this powerful Virtue to &s;top immediately the greate&s;t Hoe|morrhages or Fluxes of Blood, that often happen in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, by hanging it in a Bag upon the Brea&s;t of the Per&s;on: and that its Force is &s;o great, as to hinder the Evacua|tion of what is nece&s;&s;ary and natural after|wards, if it be not removed in time: For which rea&s;on, &s;he takes it off at the end of twelve or four and twenty Hours at farthe&s;t. This &s;he a&s;&s;ures me &s;he has likewi&s;e made u&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="22">of in tho&s;e inward Bleedings of the Small Pox, and with perfect good Succe&s;s; it &s;top|ping them immediately, as &s;he had clearly experimented more than once, and does not doubt but it will always an&s;wer the &s;ame. However, there is one thing to be taken care of, that this Herb be pretty fre&s;h and good, for if it be either decay'd, or has been too long or too often us'd, its Virtue is then lo&s;t; as &s;he particularly prov'd upon Per&s;ons who have bled at the No&s;e habitually: For tho' it will both &s;top and prevent &s;uch Bleed|ings while worn upon the Per&s;on, yet it mu&s;t be renewed at the end of two or three Months at farthe&s;t. I have &s;een my &s;elf &s;ome Effects of it in this latter Ca&s;e: but have not had Opportunities of the former. However, I am far from di&s;countenancing the Tryals of it, as &s;ome, I que&s;tion not, will do, who are of another Temper, as well as intellect from their great Ma&s;ter <HI>Hippocra|tes;</HI> who &s;ays, <Q>"That a Phy&s;ician ought not to be a&s;ham'd to inform him&s;elf, tho' by the meane&s;t People, of Remedies con|firm'd by Experience. By this means, in my Opinion, the Art of Phy&s;ick grew up by degrees, that is, by ama&s;&s;ing and col|lecting Ob&s;ervations of the &s;everal parti|cular Ca&s;es one by one, which being all put together, make one entire Body."</Q></P>
<P>But to return (from this &s;omething long, tho' not u&s;ele&s;s Digre&s;&s;ion) to the Examina|tion of <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s other Rea&s;ons for Bleed|ing. This fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t of a Plethora
<PB N="20" REF="23">&s;uppos'd, being not &s;o common or probable a Ca&s;e (e&s;pecially among the Rich) as has been mi&s;takenly imagin'd.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Rea&s;on in <HI>LeClark</HI>'s Collection of them was, <Q>"to <HI>divert</HI> or <HI>Recall</HI> the Cour&s;e of the Blood, which was going where it ought not to be."</Q></P>
<P>This might probably have been u&s;eful in tho&s;e Ca&s;es I lately mention'd: but we are not to &s;uppo&s;e a Nece&s;&s;ity for a thing, where there is none. For this would be, like a Per&s;on, who having &s;een another die of an Apoplexy, and hearing it after reported, that if the deceas'd had us'd Bleeding, Vomiting, and Bli&s;tering, he had e&s;cap'd his Death; this &s;hould make him upon the fir&s;t time he was dozie, or his Head ach'd, &s;end for an A|pothecary and a Surgion, and order him&s;elf to be immediately Blooded, Bli&s;ter'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by way of Prevention: Which, if not the fir&s;t time, yet if this Humour often took him, would infallibly ruine the be&s;t Con&s;titution in the World, and bring upon him &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es and Di&s;orders, as he would ne|ver have been attack'd with, had he forborn tho&s;e Methods.</P>
<P>That this is a parallel Ca&s;e, and that there is as great Hazards, and commonly as little Nece&s;&s;ity (bating perhaps a little pre&s;ent Ea&s;e, (which might happen too in both Ca&s;es, it commonly cau&s;ing an Enlivening or Brisk|ne&s;s) for &s;uch a Practice in the one Ca&s;e as in
<PB N="21" REF="24">the other; I appeal to the experienc'd and &s;ucce&s;sful Dr. <HI>Mapletoft</HI> abovemention'd, p. 1, 2. But to proceed.</P>
<P>A third end of Bleeding was, <HI>to procure a free Motion of the Blood and Spirits:</HI> which, tho' Dr. <HI>Le Clarke</HI> has quoted in his Hi&s;tory of Phy&s;ick a long Ca&s;e, that will not much re|&s;emble the Small Pox, nor any Di&s;temper known in <HI>England</HI> at this Day: Yet &s;ince there are Di&s;orders of the Nerves, and there may be Stagnations both of the Blood and Spirits in this pre&s;ent Di&s;temper, I &s;hall be told, that we are not to take the&s;e as &s;light Indications, or Symptoms; and I confe&s;s they are not, being &s;uch as put not only <HI>Sy|denham,</HI> but many others, I believe, upon forcible Methods to remove them. Yet if we have &s;hew'd that there are very great Ha|zards in going that way to work for the Re|lief of the Patient; and that there is a &s;afer and better way, and one more peculiarly a|dapted to this Di&s;temper, and that carries &s;everal great Advantages with it, of u&s;e in the whole cour&s;e of it after: This is certain|ly to be prefer'd before any precarious or hazardous Method: And &s;uch an one I pub|li&s;h'd in my la&s;t Treati&s;e or E&s;&s;ay, which had &s;o far the Approbation of two of the Greate&s;t Men in this Nation, one for his un|parallel'd Skill in Mathematicks and natural Philo&s;ophy. The other for his equal Read|ing and Experience too in the practical part
<PB N="22" REF="25">of Phy&s;ick. That the
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newten.</HI></NOTE> fir&s;t of them told me upon his through Peru&s;al of my Tenth Experiment or Ca&s;e, with what follows up|on it, <HI>It was a better way than any thing el&s;e in the beginning;</HI> and in a &s;econd Vi&s;it he terth'd it, <HI>A very fair Propo&s;al and De&s;ign.</HI> The other
<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely.</HI></NOTE> Dignified Per&s;on, peru&s;ing and approving my whole Book through, told me upon the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age or Experiment, That he thought long till he could trye it him&s;elf: &s;o much was he &s;atisfied with the apparent Safety, and more than probable Efficacy, of it.</P>
<P>However, I have not yet attain'd my end of publi&s;hing that Piece, which was, to have the fore-mention'd, and &s;ome other things, fully try'd for publick U&s;e. Nor have I yet, on the contrary, receiv'd an account of any the lea&s;t Matters of Fact, nor &s;o much as Ar|guments (except what I have mention'd in my Preface, which I really receiv'd) urg'd again&s;t the whole or a part; &s;o true is it (what that highly skilful Per&s;on in a Profe&s;|&s;ion &s;carce le&s;s

<PB N="23" REF="26">Matter to introduce a new Invention in Medicin: The Phy&s;icians of the Town, as he had experienc'd, being all inclin'd tena|ciou&s;ly to follow their own way; at lea&s;t not to admit of any that was more plain and ea&s;y. What Alteration this &s;econd Treati&s;e of mine (which I de&s;ign'd to have been much longer) will make, I mu&s;t wait a little while to know.</P>
<P>One thing more I &s;hall mention here; which is, that when I la&s;t paid my Duty to his Lord&s;hip, he gave me fre&s;h A&s;&s;urances of the Goodne&s;s of his own plain Medicine, or that I call his own, he having recommended it to me: he now again commended the &s;ame: and told me he had done good things with it.</P>
<P>This I &s;peak, becau&s;e its having been laid a&s;ide in common Practice, &s;eems to me for little other Rea&s;on, but, becau&s;e it did not &s;uit the Humour of the Town when former|ly publi&s;h'd: tho' 'tis far more &s;afe, and com|monly effectual too, than tho&s;e in pre&s;ent vogue, which I have given Rea&s;ons for in that E&s;&s;ay. But to return.</P>
<P>A Fourth Intention of <HI>Hippocrates</HI> in Bleed|ing, was, for <HI>Refre&s;hment</HI> or Ea&s;e. The In|&s;tance there is in the Iliack Pa&s;&s;ion. But I have given an In&s;tance where <HI>Sydenham</HI> hath us'd both that and Vomiting for the &s;ame In|tention of acquiring Ea&s;e and Refre&s;hment only, in the Small Pox; which is very often
<PB N="24" REF="27">better procur'd another way. See p. 81, 82, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of my before-mention'd E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>In the next Paragraph he tells us, That the Conduct of <HI>Hippocrates</HI> was much the &s;ame in Bleeding, as Purging, in re&s;pect of <HI>Time and Per&s;ons. We ought,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to let Blood in acute Di&s;ea&s;es, when they are violent, and if the Party be lu&s;ty, and in the Flower of his Age.</HI></P>
<P>In tho&s;e In&s;tances I have given, pag. 11, 12. of an exce&s;&s;ive Athletick [or full] Habit of Body, the Flower of Youth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;hould not have been again&s;t Bleeding, but for it, for the &s;peedy taking off a Plethora, and for turning the Cour&s;e of the Blood as &s;peedily as might be: But that this is to be done al|ways, and to all Per&s;ons indifferently who have this Di&s;temper, and are in Youth, I mu&s;t deny; and once more appeal to the &s;afer and better Practice of Dr. <HI>Mapletoft,</HI> who generally omitted this, as we may mo&s;t rea|&s;onably infer from pag. 4. As for tho&s;e Circum&s;tances of <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es acute and violent,</HI> tho' the Small Pox is both, yet we mu&s;t not fal&s;e|ly, or upon ill grounds, draw in <HI>Hippocrates</HI>'s Advice or Authority, even tho' the Di&s;tem|per be attended with Pain too; which is an|other of his Indications for Bleeding; tho&s;e Di&s;tempers he directed it for, being Quin|zies, Pleuri&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (as is plain in the Ori|ginal) which, we know by Experience, not only admit of Alleviation or Abatement of their Pain by Bleeding, but very often of a mo&s;t &s;peedy Cure too by that alone. But
<PB N="25" REF="28">the Ca&s;e of the Small Pox is widely diffe|rent: For the greate&s;t Progre&s;s we can make towards its fini&s;hing its Cour&s;e by this, or u&s;ing other Evacuations, is only to bring it into Act, or to make its plain, and too com|monly very evil Appearance; but the Pa|tient is obliged to undergo almo&s;t the whole Cour&s;e of it afterwards, which how tedious and hara&s;&s;ing, as well as dangerous a one it is frequently in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, I my &s;elf have &s;ufficiently felt as well as &s;een. The&s;e la&s;t therefore are no Precedents to go by; and I wi&s;h all who have to do in directing for the Cure of this Di&s;temper, would not in&s;i&s;t up|on the Precepts, (e&s;pecially as collected by others, or taken from particular Ca&s;es in <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> no ways parallel to ours) but would rather follow the Practice of this &s;age and well experienc'd Phy&s;ician, (which would mo&s;t exactly &s;uit this Di&s;temper, as plainly appears by
<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See again, p. 1, 2.</NOTE> Fact) and in it they would find, that he u&s;ed the greate&s;t Caution a|gain&s;t Evacuations in the Beginning of all acute Di&s;tempers, this of bleeding e&s;pecial|ly, which <HI>Le Clark</HI> tells us he very &s;eldom u&s;ed; and that in his Fir&s;t and Third Book of Epidemicks, (which he calls the mo&s;t fi|ni&s;hed of his Works) we find but one &s;in|gle In&s;tance, and that in a Pleuri&s;y. So much did he tru&s;t to the Power of Nature, whom he endeavour'd always to &s;upport, and not, by the too often fal&s;e Reliefs of Art, to weaken and de&s;troy.</P>
