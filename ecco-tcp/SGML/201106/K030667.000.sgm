<HEAD>BILL of HEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>"A MAN," &s;ays Cel&s;us, "who is ble&s;|&s;ed with good health, &s;hould con|fine him&s;elf to <HI>no particular rules,</HI> either with re&s;pect to regimen or medicine. He ought frequently to diver&s;ify his manner of living; to be &s;ometimes in town, &s;ome|times in the country; to hunt, &s;ail, indulge him&s;elf in re&s;t, but more frequently to u&s;e exerci&s;e. He ought to refu&s;e no kind of food that is commonly u&s;ed, but &s;ometimes to eat more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s; &s;ome|times to make one at an entertainment, and &s;ometimes to forbear it; to make ra|ther two meals than one, and always to eat heartily, provided he can dige&s;t it. He ought neither too eagerly to pur&s;ue, nor too &s;crupulou&s;ly to avoid intercour&s;e with the fair &s;ex: Plea&s;ures of this kind, rarely indulged, render the body alert and active, but, when too frequently repeated, weak and languid. He &s;hould be careful, in time of health, not to de&s;troy, by exce&s;&s;es of any kind, that vigour of con&s;titution which &s;hould &s;upport him under &s;ickne&s;s."</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>Keep con&s;tant to a plain diet. Tho&s;e enjoy mo&s;t health, and live longe&s;t, that avoid curio&s;ity and variety of meats and drinks. Aged and decrepid per&s;ons ought to eat often, and but little at a time, of moi&s;t and liquid food, as &s;uch food nou|ri&s;hes &s;oone&s;t, and dige&s;ts ea&s;ie&s;t. The le&s;s a &s;ick per&s;on eats, the &s;ooner he will recover; for it is a true &s;aying, <HI>The more you fill foul bodies the more you hurt them.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t unhealthy are found among tho&s;e who feed high upon the mo&s;t delicious dainties, and drink &s;trong and &s;piritous li|quors; whereas others, who want &s;uch de|licate fare, are &s;eldom &s;ick, unle&s;s they have &s;uch un&s;atiable appetites as to eat too much. Experience teaches men, that, af|ter they have indulged their appetites to exce&s;s, they find them&s;elves heavy and dull, and often &s;leepy, which &s;ufficiently &s;hews that tho&s;e meals are prejudicial to the wel|fare of the body; whereas, in the morning before they have eaten, they are light and plea&s;antly ea&s;y. To &s;up &s;paringly is mo&s;t healthful, becau&s;e the &s;tomach being not over burthened, the &s;leep is more plea&s;ant; and from &s;paring-&s;uppers, the breeding of tho&s;e humours is prevented, which cau&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="3">defluxions, rheumati&s;ms, gouts, drop&s;ies, giddine&s;s, and corruption in the mouth from the &s;curvy. From fa&s;ting, or a very &s;pare diet, many indi&s;po&s;itions may be cu|red. And to pre&s;erve health, one meal &s;hould not be eaten till the former has pa&s;|&s;ed clean out of the &s;tomach (which is known when hunger calls for another &s;up|ply) by means of which con&s;tant practice, the food will be converted to good chyle, and from good chyle, which is a milk-like &s;ub&s;tance, good blood will be bred, and from good blood generous &s;pirits will be produced, on which a healthy con&s;titution and liberal mind will en&s;ue; but on the contrary, when too great a quantity of food is taken (for the plea&s;ure of ta&s;te) which the &s;tomach cannot well dige&s;t, the chyle will become raw and corrupt, foul the blood, effect the pa&s;&s;ions, and render the body di&s;ordered and unhealthy. Mi&s;ers, who eat and drink but little, live long. Two meals a day are &s;aid to be &s;ufficient for weak people, and all per&s;ons after fifty years of age, as the omitting of &s;uppers conduceth much to their health.</P>
<P>Every intention in the cure of di&s;orders may be an&s;wered by diet alone; but the
<PB N="4" REF="4">food mu&s;t be whole&s;ome, and taken regu|lar, or the con&s;equences will be bad. The poor are generally the fir&s;t who &s;uffer by unwhole&s;ome food, which often cau&s;es in|fection, and reaches people in every &s;ta|tion. There are many ways by which provi&s;ions may be rendered unwhole&s;ome. Acts of Providence we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to. Bad &s;ea&s;ons may either prevent the ripen|ing of grain, or damage it afterwards; but no puni&s;hment can be too &s;evere for tho&s;e who &s;uffer provi&s;ions to &s;poil, by hoard|ing them, in order to rai&s;e the price. All animal &s;ub&s;tances have a con&s;tant tendency to putrefaction; and the &s;ounde&s;t grain, if kept too long, becomes unfit for u&s;e. No animal can be whole&s;ome which does not take &s;ufficient exerci&s;e. Mo&s;t of our &s;talled cattle, &s;wine, &amp;c. are crammed with gro&s;s food, but not allowed exerci&s;e nor free air, by which means they indeed grow fat, but their humours, not being properly prepared, remain crude, and oc|ca&s;ion indige&s;tions, gro&s;s humours, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirits, in tho&s;e who feed upon them.</P>
<P>Good tea, taken in moderation, not too &s;trong nor too hot, nor drunk upon an
<PB N="5" REF="5">empty &s;tomach, will &s;eldom do harm; but if it be bad, or &s;ub&s;tituted in place of &s;olid food, it mu&s;t be prejudicial.</P>
<P>All high-&s;ea&s;oning, pickles, &amp;c. are only incentives to luxury, and never fail to hurt the &s;tomach. Plain roa&s;ting or boiling is all that the &s;tomach requires. Were fer|mented liquors faithfully prepared, kept to a proper age, and u&s;ed in moderation, they would prove real ble&s;&s;ings; but while they are ill prepared, and various ways adultered, &s;ince preparing and vending of them have become the mo&s;t coveted and lucrative branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, their quality &s;hould be &s;trictly examined. Families ought to brew and bake for their own u&s;e; as the grand object of the venders is to render the liquors intoxicating, and the bread to plea&s;e the eye, rather than to con&s;ult the health of the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>Diet ought to be &s;uited to the man|ner of life. A &s;edentary or &s;tudious per|&s;on &s;hould live more &s;paringly than one who labours hard without doors. Many kinds of food will nouri&s;h a pea&s;ant very well, which would be almo&s;t indige&s;tible to a citizen; and the latter will live upon a diet on which the former would &s;tarve.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>It is the opinion of an eminent Phy&s;i|cian that fa&s;ting, re&s;t, and drinking water, will cure mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es; for fa&s;ting gives time to the &s;tomach to unload it&s;elf of the cau&s;e of di&s;tempers, the cau&s;e of all di&s;ea&s;es being begun in that bowel only; to the clean&s;ing of which, drinking plentifully of water will much contribute.</P>
<P>With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fre&s;h air, and the above means, the following ca&s;e was ef|fected: "A neighbour of mine became very feveri&s;h, and his wife per&s;uaded him to go to bed. I heard of it &s;oon after, and gave him a vi&s;it, where I found the win|dows clo&s;e &s;hut, the curtains of the bed drawn, and the room very hot, for it was in the month of July: he was burning hot, and complained for want of breath. I drew open the curtains, covered him warm, and then opened the windows, and the wind blew into the room; upon which he &s;oon told me his &s;hortne&s;s of breath had left him. I per&s;uaded him to drink &s;ome water, which he found did much refre&s;h him; and, after I had taken my leave of him, he called for more water; and, while he had the cup in his hand, the apothecary came in, whom his wife had &s;ent for, who,
<PB N="7" REF="7">finding him about to drink the water, told him if he did do it he was a dead man; but, in&s;tead of forbearing, he drank it up in his pre&s;ence: upon which the apothe|cary took his leave, and told him he would &s;ay no more to him. However, before night, the per&s;on got up, went abroad, and was cured of his fever.</P>
<P>That there is a po&s;&s;ibility of curing di&s;|ea&s;es by a diet only that is temperate and cooling, &s;uch as milk, and the roots and &s;eeds of vegetables, viz. potatoes, turnips, wheat, rice, barley, oatmeal, and full-ripe fruit, let the following remarkable in&s;tance, te&s;tified by Dr. Cheyne, evince: A phy&s;i|cian that lived at Croyden, who had long been afflicted with the falling-evil, by &s;low ob&s;ervation, found, that the lighter his meals were, the lighter were his fits. At la&s;t he al&s;o ca&s;t off all liquids but water, and found his fits weaker, and the intervals longer; and finding his di&s;ea&s;e mend, as its fewel was withdrawn, he took to vegetable food, and water only, which put an entire period to his fits, without any relap&s;e; but find|ing that food windy to him, he took to milk, of which he eat a pint for a breakfa&s;t, a quart at dinner, and a pint for &s;upper,
<PB N="8" REF="8">without fi&s;h, fle&s;h, bread, or any &s;trong or &s;piritous liquor, or any drink but water, with which he lived afterwards for a num|ber of years, without the lea&s;t interruption in his health, &s;trength, or vigour.</P>
<P>Temperance or &s;pare diet, void of dain|ties, never was injurious to the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titution, and, without it, &s;uch as are weak and &s;ickly, cannot long exi&s;t; for the more &s;uch per&s;ons eat and drink, the more weak and di&s;ordered they will &s;till find them&s;elves to be. It is cu&s;tom only that makes men hanker after gluttony and drunkenne&s;s, and a contrary cu&s;tom will make men abhor it as much.</P>
<P>Temperance will enable the rich to live more at ea&s;e, and enjoy their wealth the longer, being the &s;ure&s;t way to prolong life, though it hath not the power to make tho&s;e young who are aged; but it will make the aged more free from decrepid|ne&s;s, and die with more ca&s;e, if the death|bed hath been well prepared for by a good life.</P>
