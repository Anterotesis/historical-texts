<HEAD>AN INQUIRY INTO THE Original Production OF <HI>INSECTS</HI> IN Human Bodies.</HEAD>
<P>NOT only have the manner of Secretion and U&s;e of the Ge|nital Liquor been the occa|&s;ion of Di&s;putation, but al&s;o its Matter and Compo&s;ition have been the Subject of much Inquiry; and the Methods they have u&s;ed for Satisfaction, were, (1&s;t) Hypothetic Arguments. (2ly)
<PB N="4" REF="3">Experimental Examination. Of the fir&s;t &s;ort, <HI>viz.</HI> Inquirers, or rather Gue&s;&s;ers, are, (1.) Such as derive the Sperm from the Brain only. (2.) From Brain, Heart, and Liver. (3.) From an uncertain Juice convey'd from the Brain along the &s;pinal Marrow to the Spermaticks. (4.) Such as a&s;cribe a &s;permatick Force to the Kid|neys. (5.) Such as will have it to be a Mixture and Temperature, taken from all the Facultys of the Soul. (6.) Such as plead that it falls from the parts of the Body into the le&s;&s;er Veins, and out of them a&s;cends into the greater, and &s;wims like a Cloud upon the Humours; and is at la&s;t attracted by the force of the Te&s;ticles. (7.) Some derive it from all the Parts of the Body; others from the Ma&s;s of Blood only. (8.) Some wholly reject the la&s;t, and fetch it from a &s;weeter Juice, or &s;ome milky chylous Matter. (9.) Others &s;ay it's the Excrement or Re&s;iduum of the mo&s;t elaborated and finely dige&s;ted Juices, falling like a Dew from all the Parts of the Body, and meet|ing at the Spermaticks. (10.) Some will have it to be only a &s;imple uncom|pounded nervous Juice, de&s;titute of all other Mixtures.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the chief Opinions of the Hypothetical Gentlemen, and each of them had their Patrons and &s;trenuous De|fenders;
<PB N="5" REF="4">who rack'd their Wits to in|vent Arguments to maintain their darling Notion: And many of their Arguments are fitter to move Laughter, or rai&s;e the Choler of the &s;ober, than to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity, or inform his Judgment. Where|fore &s;ome who were di&s;&s;atisfy'd with this &s;uppo&s;ititious or gue&s;&s;ive Way of arguing, I go with them next to experimental Ex|amination; the fir&s;t whereof hath cau&s;ed the animal Seed to undergo the fiery Trial of the Chymi&s;ts Furnace, to make it di&s;cover its Principles, but found it con&s;i&s;t only of the &s;ame with all the Parts of animal Bodies; <HI>viz.</HI> An in&s;ipid Wa|ter, a fetid Oil, &s;ome volatile Salt, a Re|&s;iduum of much light Earth in the <HI>Retort;</HI> but in <HI>Rectification</HI> it afforded no Spirit.

<PB N="6" REF="5">by ocular Examination and Demon&s;tra|tion; whereby they are convinc'd, that the Sperm is only a Croud of <HI>Animalcula,</HI> or &s;mall Worms, with long Tails, like Tadpoles, &s;wimming in a vi&s;cid Serum. And they are &s;o found of this notable Di&s;covery, that <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI> and <HI>Hart|&s;ecker</HI> are like to go by the ears about it, each challenging this for his own Ob|&s;ervation and Invention: But let them differ as they plea&s;e, we know it belongs to neither of them, for <HI>D. Ham</HI> fir&s;t of all ob&s;erv'd the&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> in the Se|men of a Cock. And long before any of them, <HI>Ludovicus Bonaciolus</HI> advi&s;es us, when we are &s;olicitous to know whether a Woman be conceiv'd with Child, to take her Urine, and put it into a Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;el, &s;hut it up, and &s;et it three days in the Shade; then filter it thro' a Linen Cloth, and if you find therein little Worms like Lice, then he &s;ays &s;he is certainly conceiv'd. Now one wou'd think that the&s;e were <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI>'s <HI>Ani|malcula,</HI> or little perfect Men, come down from the <HI>&V;terus</HI> to keep centry in the Neck of the Bladder, till they be wa&s;h'd off by the Urine, and chang'd into &s;mall Lice. A &s;trange Metamorpho&s;is indeed, Men become Lice! But to a&s;cend higher; <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his <HI>Sympo&s;iacon, Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 9. di&s;cover'd and de&s;crib'd a Sper|matick Worm, &s;aying, <HI>Ho&s;pitem no&s;trum
<PB N="7" REF="6">novimus Athenis Ephebum cum multo &s;e|mine ejeci&s;&s;e Be&s;tiolam a&s;peram multis pedibus celeriter ambulantem.</HI> But nei|ther is this Doctrine of Seminal <HI>Animal|cula</HI> without its Opponents; for <HI>Iddo Wolfius, Philip Verheyen, Chri&s;tianus Vater, Johannes Langius, Andreas Otto|mar, Gaelickius,</HI> and &s;everal others, flatly deny the Exi&s;tence of any &s;uch Infects in the Genital Liquor, and &s;ay, that what is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the&s;e <HI>Animalcula,</HI> is only Flatus's of Air, intermix'd with the Sperm, which, &s;eeking to unbend them|&s;elves, or make their e&s;cape, cau&s;e that Motion in the Seed.</P>
<Q>At no&s;trum non e&s;t tantas componere lites.</Q>
<P>But we &s;hall allow the Ma&s;culine Semen (like mo&s;t other Fluids) to abound with the&s;e little Infects, and &s;hall attempt to give a rational Account how they come into it, and are bred in it, and why they are more con&s;picuous here than in mo&s;t other Fluids of the Body.</P>
<P>It's the Opinion of &s;ome, that whil&s;t we are young, and our Stomachs weak, the <HI>Ova</HI> of In&s;ects taken in with our Food and Air may e&s;cape the Attenuation, Dige&s;tion, Communication and Attrition of the Stomach and Inte&s;tines, and lie there and generate Worms, which may
<PB N="8" REF="7">again depo&s;ite their <HI>Ova</HI> in the Guts, &s;ome whereof may be &s;o &s;mall as to en|ter the Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els, together with the Chyle, and mix and circulate with the Blood, and be &s;train'd off by the &s;perma|tick Ve&s;&s;els, &s;ooner than any other Sub|&s;tance, becau&s;e of their &s;moothne&s;s and politene&s;s; and if they be &s;o &s;mall as to enter the &s;mall Pipes, they may be readily convey'd along all the Gyres, Turnings and Windings of the <HI>Te&s;tes</HI> and <HI>Epididymides,</HI> till they arrive at the different Ve&s;&s;els, and thence get into the &s;everal Bladders, whither there are daily arriving other new ones, till the Age of Puberty, or time of Seminal Di&s;charge: And that thus the Seminal Bladders, from a &s;up|pos'd continual Addition of new <HI>Ova,</HI> may be &s;tretch'd forth and extended, ju&s;t as the Inte&s;tines of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> are full of <HI>Meconium</HI> before the Birth, and the Bladder full of Urine. Now when the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> are got into the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Semi|nales,</HI> where they are at re&s;t, and lie till the Boy is of Age, and there generate, and become little In&s;ects, and &s;o cover the Surface of the Seed-Bladders, they &s;hall never be free of that Spawn, till we are capable of Generation; but when we are grown to Strength, our Stomachs and Inte&s;tines are &s;o &s;trong, that they attenuate, dige&s;t, and grind down, not
<PB N="9" REF="8">only the In&s;ects which we &s;wallow, but the <HI>Ova</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>To all which may be an&s;wer'd, That it's improbable and impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e impregnated <HI>Ova</HI> &s;hould lie in the Se|minal Bladders, from Infancy to Puberty, without coming to Life: And if they &s;hould become live Infects, and breed without any Evacuation of them for &s;o many Years, what irreparable Mi&s;chief mu&s;t they fir&s;t make upon their containing Seminal Bladders, and then upon the cir|cumjacent Parts, Inte&s;tines, Bladders, Pe|ritoneum? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And none can deny this, who have read <HI>Sennertus, Schenckius, Spigelius,</HI> and others, who have &s;een and written on the Tragedys acted by Worms, how they have corroded the Stomachs and Inte&s;tines of Children, and even eaten their way thro' the Belly and Navel; yea, that they con&s;umed all that fle&s;hy Part on the Groins, and came to the Surface of the Body. Now if Vermin make &s;uch Di&s;patch, in a &s;hort time, upon thick and &s;trong Inte&s;tines and Mu&s;|cles; I do not &s;ee how the delicate Se|minal Bladders can, for 15 or 16 Years, impri&s;on &s;uch innumerable Numbers of <HI>Animalcula,</HI> generated and bred from &s;uch a heap of <HI>Ova,</HI> as from Infancy to Puberty are daily added to them from the <HI>Te&s;tes</HI> and different Ve&s;&s;els; be&s;ides
<PB N="10" REF="9">the prodigious <HI>Myriads</HI> which are &s;till generated from the diurnal Generation of the formerly repo&s;ited <HI>Ova</HI> and In&s;ects: for what may be done by a few Worms or Maggots in a &s;hort time, may certain|ly be expected from a va&s;t Congeries of little Animals, in &s;o many Years; e&s;pe|cially &s;eeing there is both a daily Gene|ration there, and a continual new Addi|tion from the <HI>Te&s;tes.</HI> How quickly is Chee&s;e con&s;umed by Mites, Leaves of Trees by imperceptible In&s;ects, Hair of Animals by the <HI>Tinea</HI> or &s;mall Mite, and &s;olid Wood it &s;elf into Du&s;t by minute In&s;ects?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hou'd be an&s;wer'd, that the <HI>Ova</HI> arriving at the Seminal Bladders, are &s;o very &s;mall, and the number &s;o in|con&s;iderable, that we need be under no Apprehen&s;ion of Danger from them: yet this affords no Satisfaction when we con|&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That from Infancy there's &s;up|pos'd to be a continual Addition of new <HI>Ova,</HI> &s;tretching forth and extending the Cavitys of the Seminal Bladders, till the Boy be of Age.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When we reflect on the &s;ud|den Generation of In&s;ects every where, (for a <HI>Chry&s;alis</HI> in which a Worm had been wrapt up, will be full to day, and to morrow quite empty, and the Butter|fly
<PB N="11" REF="10">got out of it, flying abroad in its full Stature and Magnitude) &s;ince this Generation is &s;o &s;udden, and their Spawn &s;o numerous; this de&s;troys their Argu|ment, who &s;ay that the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> may be laid up in the different Ve&s;&s;els and Se|minal Bladders, till the Boy comes to the Age of Puberty. The Difficultys &s;uch Gentlemen leave us in the dark a|bout, are as great as any they can re|move: for,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> may lie in a Quies in the Seminal Blad|ders, till the Age of Puberty; then what prevents the Generation of the&s;e repo&s;ited <HI>Ova,</HI> and impregnation of the <HI>Animal|cula</HI> in the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> until the Boy be <HI>Puber?</HI> Or what is there to im|pregnate, and render them fruitle&s;s after that time, which there was not before? What hinders the Corruption and Putre|faction of the&s;e &s;mall <HI>Ova,</HI> lying &s;o many Years in a warm moi&s;t Place, which is fit either for Generation or Corruption? But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If they did generate, (as it's mo&s;t probable they would, if they were there) how could the&s;e &s;trait Bladders be capable to contain &s;uch a va&s;t Croud, as a diurnal Generation in that place, and a daily new Supply from the Te&s;ticles, mu&s;t amount to. 'Tis &s;urprizing that any
<PB N="12" REF="11">&s;hould pretend that the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> &s;hould be &s;train'd off only by the <HI>ductus &s;perma|tici,</HI> when we are a&s;&s;ur'd from Expe|rience, that they are &s;train'd off and ge|nerated in all Parts of the Body, both internally and externally. And according to the&s;e Gentlemen's Hypothe&s;is, when the <HI>Ova</HI> are got into the Seed-Bladders, &s;eeing they are for &s;everal Years &s;hut up in the&s;e Cells, we might expect them to produce Maggots, were they capable of &s;uch Growth and Bulk. And as a Con&s;equence of this, the fir&s;t ejected <HI>Semen</HI> would be chiefly a Heap of Worms or In&s;ects, in&s;tead of &s;mall (and impercep|tible by the naked Eye) <HI>Animalcula:</HI> And according to this Opinion, more Sperm &s;hould be ejected the fir&s;t Year after Puberty, than in &s;everal Years after, and that Sperm &s;hould be better elabo|rated and fuller of <HI>Animalcula;</HI> and, &s;up|po&s;ing the&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> &s;o many Em|brios of human <HI>Foetus</HI>'s, &s;hould be more productive of &s;trong, healthy and lively Children: all which is contradicted by daily Experience.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Seeing the&s;e Infects are &s;o &s;hort liv'd, then if they generated in the <HI>Ve&s;i|culae Seminales</HI> &s;o many Years, the great|e&s;t number mu&s;t be dead, putrify'd and rotten in that time. And one would think it very improbable for the re&s;t to live in
<PB N="13" REF="12">&s;uch a Kennel of Filthine&s;s, e&s;pecially to feed upon the putrify'd Carrion of their own Species, which certainly mu&s;t make up a con&s;iderable part of their repa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall give the Rea&s;ons which &s;eem to me more probable, why Children have not <HI>Animalcula</HI> repo&s;ited from <HI>Ova</HI> in their Seminal Bladders (&s;up|po&s;ing the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> to come from without and &s;wallow'd down, together with our Air and Food) altho we had an Oppor|tunity to examine with a Micro&s;cope, that thin, u&s;ele&s;s, in&s;ipid Mucilage, contain'd in the Te&s;ticles, <HI>Epididymides,</HI> different Ve&s;&s;els, and Seminal Bladders; becau&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> During Infancy the &s;training Ve&s;|&s;els or Glands of the Te&s;ticles are too narrow and &s;mall for the <HI>Ova</HI> to pa&s;s; which is further prov'd from &s;uch Ob&s;er|vations as &s;hew that the <HI>Ova</HI> being mix'd with the Blood, when that comes to pa&s;s the capillary Ve&s;&s;els, the Diameter of the Egg being larger than the Cavity of the Ve&s;&s;el, it mu&s;t &s;top there, and be wedg'd in by the Force of the Fluids behind; is hatch'd by the Body's Heat, and produces a Worm or Worms, if o|ther <HI>Ova</HI> arrive at it, and &s;top al&s;o: And this Ca&s;e we know has often happen'd in mo&s;t parts of the Body. Thus Worms have been bred and found in the Liver, Kidneys, Bladder, Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, Brain,
<PB N="14" REF="13">Eyes, Teeth, Ears, No&s;trils, Feet, Na|vel, Heart, Lungs, Spleen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some|times where Ulcers or Abce&s;&s;es have &s;eated them&s;elves in any external Parts of the Body, there have been found Worms in them: Of the&s;e <HI>Herod, Sylla,</HI> and <HI>Aleman,</HI> were eaten up, and are called by <HI>Coelius Aurelianus, pediculi ferales.</HI> I &s;hall not here treat of the &s;undry Kinds of Infects found in the Inte&s;tines; <HI>Andre</HI> and <HI>Le Clerc</HI> have written well on this Subject; but e&s;pecially the learned <HI>Va|li&s;nerius,</HI> who hath carefully di&s;&s;ected &s;everal of them, and hath oblig'd the World with a curious Anatomy of them. And tho Worms have bred in mo&s;t other Parts of the Body, yet we have &s;carce any In&s;tances, where they have been ob&s;erv'd to generate in, or be di&s;charg'd from the Sub&s;tance of Childrens <HI>Te&s;tes.</HI> Wherefore I am ready to think that the&s;e &s;ecretory Ducts, which &s;train off the <HI>Semen</HI> from the Blood, are very narrow, and there|fore the Eggs cannot enter nor pa&s;s them, but are, together with the Blood, returned back to the &s;permatick Veins. This O|pinion appears more &s;atisfactory, becau&s;e the Sperm &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of more ela|borated Particles, than the matter of o|ther Evacuations; for its more ponderous Sub&s;idy in Water is of a thicker Con|&s;i&s;tence, and conden&s;es &s;till more in Spirit
<PB N="15" REF="14">of Wine; but if it be laid on a dry Place, expo&s;ed to the Air, it pre&s;ently becomes fluid, tran&s;parent, and lo&s;es its Vi&s;cidity. The Production of Worms in the miliary Glands, on the Surface of the Body, is no good Argument again&s;t this: for,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When the <HI>Ova</HI> get out of their road, into the Labyrinths of the miliary Glands, they cau&s;e an Ob&s;truction and Tumour; they breed there, break the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and get thro' the Skin.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Worms are &s;ometimes pro|duc'd on the Surface of the Body, (where the Skin is excoriated) from the <HI>Ova</HI> floating in the Air, falling upon the grieved Place, and taking up their Abode there, and generating others.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It's not improbable that the <HI>Ova</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> of the Ma&s;cu|line <HI>Semen,</HI> are greater than the <HI>Ova</HI> of &s;ome larger In&s;ects; and then it's no wonder that they neither pa&s;s the mi|liary Glands, nor the &s;permatick Laby|rinths of Children.</P>
<P>That &s;ome particular Glands have &s;uch narrow &s;ecretory Ducts, as will not al|low the <HI>Ova</HI> to pa&s;s readily, is ma|nife&s;t,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From the ropy Matter di&s;charg'd from the <HI>Penis,</HI> upon inten&s;e amorous Thoughts, or la&s;civious Conver&s;ation,
<PB N="16" REF="15">which tho more tenacious then the <HI>Se|men,</HI> and &s;train'd off by the Glands of the <HI>&V;rethra,</HI> yet we do not hear of any <HI>Animalcula</HI> taken notice of in it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Leewenhoeck</HI> owns, that Mens <HI>Semen</HI> has no <HI>Animalcula,</HI> and this he a&s;&s;igns for a rea&s;on of Sterility; but hereof he gives us but one In&s;tance, and for any thing we know, the fault even of this might be from &s;ome indi&s;|po&s;ition in the <HI>Ova foeminaea, Tubae fallo|pianae, &V;terus,</HI> or &s;ome of the circum|jacent Parts; or the Male Sperm might want that Vivacity, Subtility, or forcible Projection: but however the&s;e were, yet we may &s;afely impute his want of <HI>Animalcula</HI> to the narrowne&s;s of the <HI>Me|anders</HI> of the <HI>Te&s;tes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Flaccidity and Emptine&s;s of the different Ve&s;&s;els and Seminal Blad|ders before Puberty, and the minute Portion of <HI>Semen,</HI> di&s;charg'd by Boys for &s;ome Months after the fir&s;t Seminal Eva|cuations; yea &s;uch is the Penury of it, that we have Hi&s;torys of &s;ome wicked Boys, who de&s;iring to anticipate Nature, and gratify their too early libidinous De|&s;ires, have ejected Blood in&s;tead of Sperm.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Not only the &s;mall quantity, but the tenuity and aqueou&s;ne&s;s of their genital Liquor, &s;hows the narrowne&s;s of their &s;permatick Strainers.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In old Age, when the Tubes contract the Canals are &s;traitned, and few or no <HI>Ova</HI> pa&s;s; there's but little <HI>Semen</HI> &s;eparated from the Blood, and what is &s;trained off is mo&s;tly u&s;ele&s;s, either for Generation or Stimulation to Venery.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The Spittle has likewi&s;e pa&s;s'd the Micro&s;copial Examination; but <HI>Lee|wenhoeck</HI> could ob&s;erve no <HI>Animalcula</HI> in it, and we are &s;ure that that Secre|tion has a much &s;horter way to pa&s;s, after its Separation from the Blood, till it come into the Mouth; &s;o that if the narrowne&s;s of the Glands hinder'd not the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Ova</HI> from the Blood, we &s;hould rather expect them here, than in the <HI>Semen.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;poken of the Vi&s;ibility of the <HI>Animalcula</HI> in all Male <HI>Semen:</HI> But now let us try how we can account for &s;uch va&s;t Multitudes of In&s;ects in this Liquor.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rea&s;on then, why I &s;uppo&s;e we meet with greater Numbers in this Liquor than in &s;everal other Secretions of the Body, is the &s;low Circulation of the Blood in the Spermatick Ve&s;&s;els, whereby the &s;eminal Particles have time to approach and attract one another: For the Cour&s;e of the Blood in the &s;per|matick Arterys, betwixt the great Ar|tery and the <HI>Te&s;tes,</HI> Dr. <HI>Keil</HI> has demon|&s;trated
<PB N="18" REF="17">to be 150 times &s;lower than the Motion of the &s;ame Blood would be in the great Artery, or even in the <HI>Iliacks.</HI> And if its Motion decrea&s;e &s;o quickly in the fir&s;t Divi&s;ion from the <HI>Aorta;</HI> how much more languid then mu&s;t its Motion be in the many Divi&s;ions, Subdivi&s;ions, Turnings and Circumvolutions of the te|&s;ticular Glands! No inward Secretion or Circulation is &s;o &s;low in the whole Body, it being little more than what &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent the Blood's &s;tagnation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The long Retention of the <HI>Semen</HI> in the different Ve&s;&s;els and Semi|nal Bladders, which is more ob&s;tinate than any one, or all of the Abdominal Secre|tions. To this I add,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The &s;peedy and &s;urprizing Ge|neration of In&s;ects, the Breeding, quick Growth, numerous Progeny, and &s;hort Life, of the Butterfly and Silk-worm, Fle&s;h-fly, and Fly-Maggots, may be &s;een at large in <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations. Now if the&s;e are bred and come to Ma|turity in &s;o very few Hours, how much &s;ooner the <HI>Ova</HI> of the <HI>Animalcula,</HI> which are much le&s;s, and may therefore be &s;up|pos'd of much &s;horter continuance? I might al&s;o in&s;tance, in the &s;urprizing, &s;peedy, and prodigious Progeny of the &s;mall Worms called <HI>A&s;tarides,</HI> great Num|bers whereof I have known bred afre&s;h
<PB N="19" REF="18">every Night, and evacuated next Morn|ing at Stool: Let us then &s;uppo&s;e the Generation of the Seminal <HI>Animalcula</HI> to be as &s;peedy; if the <HI>Ova</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s the Glands, and get into the Seminal Bladders during Childhood, what <HI>Ve&s;icu|lae Seminales</HI> would be capable to con|tain the great Fry of &s;mall Worms, bred in the &s;pace of 15 or 16 Years?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Sperm is &s;eemingly the mo&s;t homogene Secretion of the whole Body, and the mo&s;t agreeable for the Generation of the&s;e <HI>Animalcula,</HI> being it &s;elf, not only a prolifick, but a &s;mooth bal&s;amick Fluid, &s;eemingly endu'd with all Propertys which can conduce to ren|der a Liquor either fertile or nutritious. If we con&s;ider the&s;e things, we &s;hall &s;ee Rea&s;on to be of that ingenious Gentle|man's Opinion, mention'd by Dr. <HI>Blair,</HI> who thinks that the&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> are the &s;ame with tho&s;e we &s;ee in Water, but under different Shapes.</P>
<P>But let us next enquire for the Cau&s;es why the&s;e &s;mall In&s;ects are either not &s;o numerous or perceptible in the Blood, Bile, Urine, or pancreatick Juice. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> None of the&s;e &s;eem of &s;o agree|able a Nature, have neither &s;o much re&s;t, nor afford &s;o proper Nutrition.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e, as Dr. <HI>Blair</HI> &s;ays, the Blood being a Compo&s;itum of all the
<PB N="20" REF="19">various Particles of the whole Fluids in the Body; it appears, under a more &s;o|lid form in Globules, where the &s;everal Particles are compactly and firmly united, &s;o that the <HI>Ova</HI> or <HI>Animalcula</HI> are not &s;o perceptible, unle&s;s the Particles were &s;eparated into their different Parts; and even this Heterogene Mixture call'd Blood has &s;ometimes had Worms in it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The&s;e <HI>Animalcula</HI> &s;eem to meet with the cruelle&s;t Treatment in the Bile; for altho &s;everal Phy&s;icians and Na|turali&s;ts have ob&s;erv'd abundance of live Worms in the Liver, yet rarely have they been found alive in the Bile or Gall-Bladder: for this is the mo&s;t pur|gent, &s;harp and bitter of all the Secre|tions, and is chiefly made up of very &s;harp Particles like &s;mall Wedges; whereby, when by the peri&s;taltick Motion of the Guts it's mix'd with the Food and Fluids, it breaks their acrid &s;aline Particles, as well as divides the coagulated, or mixes the watry and oily: The pungent bilious Particles are darted into either the Bodies or <HI>Ova</HI> of In&s;ects, that are larger than the bilious Particles in the Inte&s;tines, and kills them if alive, or prevents their Generation if they be only in <HI>Ova:</HI> But the <HI>Ova</HI> or <HI>Animalcula</HI> &s;wallow'd with our Meat or Drink, being both &s;o nu|merous and &s;mall, get out of the <HI>Duode|num</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="20">unhurt; but if the Bile be pure and unmix'd, very few Species of In&s;ects can live in it.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on why many <HI>Ova</HI> and In&s;ects may get out of the Inte&s;tines un|touch'd by the Bile, is, either its &s;carcity in the Body, from the &s;ecretory Ducts of the Liver being &s;tuffed with a gritty Matter, cau&s;ing a Jaundice; or its meet|ing with obtundent and tenacious Meat, Drink, or Medicine, often pour'd down into the Stomach. And, la&s;tly, The <HI>A|nimalcula</HI> are not &s;o con&s;picuous in the Bile, becau&s;e it's of a darker Body than the <HI>Semen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Pancreatick Juice is con&s;tantly flowing into the <HI>Duodenum,</HI> as it's &s;eparated from the Blood, and &s;o the <HI>Ova</HI> have but a &s;hort Re&s;idence there to generate In&s;ects. And &s;uppo&s;e they were in it, its immediate Mixture with the Bile, would render it very di&s;a|greeable to live In&s;ects. This Mixture of the two Juices prevents our Di&s;co|very of <HI>Animalcula;</HI> or perhaps the Tex|ture of the procreatick Glands may not be &s;o convenient for their Conveyance.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The Urine being often full of pungent Salts, they would be darted into the delicate Bodies of the&s;e little Creatures; therefore are we not to ex|pect them &s;o frequently and plentifully
<PB N="22" REF="21">in that Liquor, it not being of &s;o ami|cable a Nature for &s;uch Gue&s;ts: And al&s;o &s;everal times have there been Worms voided with the Urine; yet do I not find that either <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI> or his Vo|tarys, have met with what they call Seminal <HI>Animalcula</HI> in it: for which rea|&s;on it would appear that the Urine is no beloved Habitation of theirs.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> The Serum of the Blood is not altogether &s;o fit a Vehicle, for they having &s;ome &s;mall Solidity, mu&s;t be de|po&s;ited in the Sediment, together with the Blood Globules, and &s;o become in|vi&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Neither could <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI> find them in the <HI>Saliva;</HI> for the Glands which &s;train it off from the Blood, &s;eem to have too narrow Ducts to &s;uffer the Pa&s;&s;age of either Infects or their Eggs. The di&s;agreeablene&s;s of both Bile and Urine to the&s;e little Animals, is fur|ther evident from this, that altho the &s;trainers of both Liver and Kidneys &s;eem larger and laxer than the te&s;ticular Strain|ers, and might therefore be &s;uppos'd to admit of the&s;e In&s;ects, yet are they rarely perceiv'd alive in the&s;e Liquors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now try to account for be &s;e|veral ways how the&s;e In&s;ects are gene|rated in the <HI>Semen,</HI> and come to be re|po&s;ited in the <HI>Ve&s;iculae Seminales,</HI> when
<PB N="23" REF="22">Boys come to Puberty: And this will &s;erve to illu&s;trate, not only the Genera|tion of the&s;e, but of all other In&s;ects which are to be met with in human Bodies. The&s;e ways I &s;uppo&s;e to be chiefly three, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t, From our Crea|tion. 2ly, From our Propagation. 3ly, From our Su&s;tentation.</P>
<P>It's from the fir&s;t two of the&s;e that we can account for Worms in the Bodies of Embrios, <HI>Foetus</HI>'s, and Abortives: But the Generation of In&s;ects from our Crea|tion, I pre&s;ume to be this, That altho God, at Man's fir&s;t Creation, did not directly and purpo&s;ely &s;ow the Seeds of &s;uch an ineradicable Vermin in human Bodies; yet Man's Body being made of Earth (whether Clay, Du&s;t or A&s;hes, it's not material to our De&s;ign) towards the Evening of the &s;ixth Day, when he had ended all his other Works; the Earth not only then abounded with In&s;ects and <HI>Ova,</HI> but having been at fir&s;t created and furni&s;h'd with the Seeds of all the&s;e, there mu&s;t fall &s;ome of the minuter of them to the &s;hare of that part of Matter, which went to the Compo&s;itum of the human Machine. And the&s;e might not only be a Seed for the Generation and Propa|gation of the&s;e In&s;ects in the fir&s;t Man's Body, but &s;erve for the Seeds of a la&s;ting Progeny in all his Po&s;terity, who &s;hall
<PB N="24" REF="23">de&s;cend from him. 'Tis &s;urprizing to &s;ee how little trouble the Antients gave them|&s;elves in inquiring into the Cau&s;e of Ver|min in animal Bodies; they were &s;atisfy'd that they had &s;olv'd the doubt at once, by &s;aying, that In&s;ects were form'd from them&s;elves, out of a certain putrid mat|ter, by Heat and Motion: But they ne|ver regarded the De&s;truction of their Hy|pothe&s;is, when they might ob&s;erve that the Generation of In&s;ects, and all other Creatures, was always alike the &s;ame; for if &s;limy and putrid Matter could give Form and Life to any Creature, it were ridiculous to expect that the Species &s;hould &s;till be of the Sort, and always keep one Form and Shape. According to their Notion, where there is plenty of Slime and an agreeable Warmth, Men might with Horror and Danger look on, and &s;ee &s;trange and prodigious Mon&s;ters daily ari&s;e out of this Heap of Putrifac|tion, ready to devour the Beholders, and the Food de&s;ign'd for their Provi&s;ion. <HI>Mercurialis,</HI> either per&s;uaded of the Folly of this Suppo&s;ition, or affecting to be &s;ingular, fled to occult Qualities, and cele&s;tial Powers, which by the Mediation of proximate Cau&s;es, form'd Animals: But he could not di&s;pute, whether this was the <HI>Facultas fortuita Galeni,</HI> or the powerful <HI>Factor calcodea Avicennae,</HI> or
<PB N="25" REF="24"><HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>Anima Mundi:</HI> In the la&s;t Age the indefatigable <HI>Redi</HI> has demon&s;trated, that the Generation of Animals and In|&s;ects is &s;till alike; and then all Philo|&s;ophers with unanimous con&s;ent, bani&s;h'd the Notion of equivocal Generation, and a&s;&s;ign'd In&s;ects the &s;ame Parents, <HI>viz. Ova:</HI> Of late appear'd the learned <HI>Va|li&s;nerius,</HI> who &s;trenuou&s;ly contends that Worms in the human Body are coeval with <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;ays that the Eggs of all In&s;ects that generate in Men, were pur|po&s;ely created by God in the Body of the fir&s;t Man, even when created in a State of Purity and Innocency. One great Difficulty which put him on coining this new Scheme, was to account from whence the&s;e Eggs came, and how they can be detain'd in human Bodies; for he thinks it equally dangerous to true Philo|&s;ophy, whether we believe that Animals are bred out of Corruption, or &s;uppo&s;e a certain kind of Animals produc'd from the Eggs of others of a different Kind, and &s;o confound their Species. Thus, &s;ays he, we give to &s;ome In&s;ects feign'd Fathers, and to others ba&s;tard Children: What he chiefly builds his Argument upon, is, That we can find no Species of In&s;ects without us, to which we may fitly compare the&s;e In&s;ects bred within us; and then to e&s;tabli&s;h his Opinion be|yond
<PB N="26" REF="25">all Controver&s;y, he &s;ays, That the In&s;ects without us, as they are of dif|ferent Kinds, &s;o they have their &s;undry Habitations: Such as live in one kind of Earth will die in another; and on Shrubs and Trees, the&s;e who live on its Roots would pine on its Leaves; and tho&s;e who feed well on the Bark, would &s;tarve on the Wood, Fruit, Leaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho it be not my De&s;ign to examine all this learned Man's Arguments, yet give me leave briefly to ob&s;erve, <HI>en pa&s;|&s;ant,</HI> that as we meet with variety of In|fects without us, &s;o are there different Kinds of Worms within us.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We know that either Vege|tables or Animals, remov'd from their na|tural Soil to a very different Climate, and Nouri&s;hment, will in a few of their Ge|nerations be &s;o much changed from their natural Appearances, that they will hard|ly be taken for the &s;ame; this is &s;o commonly allow'd, that it needs no Proof.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The many Hi&s;torys and Ob|&s;ervations of the Spawn of Frogs, Beetles, and other In&s;ects, having been unwarily &s;wallow'd down with Meat or Drink, and generated in the Body, leaves no room to doubt but that the <HI>Ova</HI> of In|&s;ects &s;wallow'd down will breed in us, and produce a Vermin which will live in us, tho depriv'd of the open Air, and
<PB N="27" REF="26">the common Food of its Species, &s;uch as that we meet with in the <HI>Philo&s;o|phical Tran&s;actions</HI> of a Man's Girl at <HI>Sheffield,</HI> aged only three Months, who after &s;wallowing greedily a Pint of Worm|wood Ale, &s;he vomited up three <HI>Hexa|podes,</HI> all very active and nimble; the&s;e, Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> &s;ays, would have chang'd to Beetles: And al&s;o the Man's Son, who after a long and grievous Pain of the Sto|mach, vomited up &s;everal &s;trange Worms, in the ninth Year of his Age; the&s;e Worms, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter,</HI> were Cater|pillars with 14 Legs, for he had many times &s;een of the &s;ame Kind on Plants; and no doubt (&s;ays he) the&s;e would in due time (if the Place had not hindred) have &s;hrunk into <HI>Chry&s;alis</HI>'s, and chang'd into Moths.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> There may be &s;ome un|heeded Circum&s;tances in the Generation and Production of &s;everal In&s;ects, that will not only come up to, but exceed the Di&s;&s;imilitude of the&s;e In&s;ects bred in in our Bodys, to the&s;e of the &s;ame Kind without us. I &s;hall in&s;tance in &s;ome that we know, <HI>E. gr.</HI> Who wou'd believe that that fine flying In&s;ect the <HI>Lybella</HI> &s;hould be generated like a Tadpole under Water, wrapt up in a Membrane till &s;he be near ready to leave that Element, and appear in a more glorious Dre&s;s in the open Air?
<PB N="28" REF="27">Who would expect that great Caterpillars &s;hould &s;ometimes produce two or three, or a whole Swarm of <HI>Ichneumones,</HI> an In&s;ect with four Wings, <HI>Antennae,</HI> like a Bee? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter, Apr.</HI> 2. 1671. dif|fected &s;ome black Beetles which were ca&s;t up in his Garden, and found live hair Worms in their Bellys, which crept out and crawl'd, when the Beetle's Belly was cut up; they were &s;ome Inches long, and about the thickne&s;s of a Hog's Bri&s;tle. The&s;e are what have been taken by the Vulgar for Hor&s;e-hairs turning into Eels, or animated Bodys in Water. Strange it is al&s;o that the wild Bees which breed in old Willows, if the&s;e Bees, Maggots or Nym|phae happen to mi&s;carry, they breed, 1&s;t, little <HI>Hexapodes,</HI> which produce Beetles: 2ly, Maggots, which produce Flys: 3ly, Mites, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And what more wonderful Metamorpho&s;is can we imagine than that of a Caterpillar into a Butterfly, and of a Butterfly into a Caterpillar again? We have al&s;o &s;ufficient Experience that &s;everal In&s;ects live ca&s;ually and promi&s;cuou&s;ly on Herbs, Leaves, Flowers, and Fruits.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In&s;ects from <HI>Ova</HI> taken into our Bodys, may generate and live there, having, during their Generation, been nouri&s;h'd with the Juices of our Bodys, and afterwards fed with the &s;ame. And in|deed it's more rea&s;onable to think that the
<PB N="29" REF="28">In&s;ects of our Bodys are bred from <HI>Ova,</HI> than from Vermin &s;wallow'd down alive; for I have known &s;ome con&s;umptive Per|&s;ons &s;wallow many &s;mall Frogs alive, without any Generation thereof, or in|convenience therefrom. But a young Fellow in the Neighbourhood where I liv'd, had not &s;o good Fate; for he in the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> carele&s;ly drank &s;ome Water, wherein was Frog|&s;pawn, and had therefrom generated in his Body a fine fry of young Frogs, whereby he was emaciated and reduced to a living Gho&s;t; and when neither the greate&s;t Bitters nor &s;trong Purges could be of any &s;ervice to him, there were given him &s;trong Vomits of white Hellebore, which rai&s;ed &s;uch violent Spa&s;ms and Con|vul&s;ions in the mu&s;cular Fibres of his Sto|mach and Inte&s;tines, that the nau&s;eous de&s;tructive Vermin were forc'd to quit their hold and be thrown up. So there's no doubt but &s;everal In&s;ects which are &s;wallow'd alive by us, will live and breed: and for this rea&s;on it is that wi&s;e Nature has taught Herons and &s;ome other Fowls, which live much on Worms and In&s;ects, to draw them often thro' their Bills, and pinch them till they are dead before they &s;wallow them. Another great Difficulty with <HI>Vali&s;nerius,</HI> is. That there have been many kinds of In&s;ects found in hu|man
<PB N="30" REF="29">Bodys, none of who&s;e Species were ever &s;een abroad in the World. But to this may be reply'd, 1. That the diffe|rent Soil may very much alter the Crea|ture from tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind without us. 2. Some Creatures have very diffe|rent Appearances, according to the &s;undry Stages of their Growth: thus Bees are fir&s;t white Maggots, then Bees; Frogs are fir&s;t Tadpoles and &s;wim like &s;mall Fi&s;h in the Water; <HI>Ichneumones</HI> are fir&s;t a kind of Tadpole, then a glorious flying In&s;ect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I confe&s;s that &s;ometimes &s;uch Ob|&s;ervers may be willing to flatter them|&s;elves, and think they have &s;een Mon&s;ters, and &s;o impo&s;e upon our Faith, when per|haps their great wonder may be only a little coagulated Blood, unnatural Ex|cre&s;ence or <HI>Polypus</HI> appearing, or cun|ningly repre&s;ented by the dextrous Ope|rator in &s;uch a Shape; for there is no &s;uch thing as a new Creation of Animals or In&s;ects of &s;uch an unknown Species; &s;uch things are proper only to amu&s;e Idiots, Half-wits and Children, who can be pre|vail'd upon to believe a &s;pontaneous Ge|neration in oppo&s;ition to God, Rea&s;on and Ob&s;ervation. The&s;e are the chief of <HI>Vali&s;nerius</HI>'s Difficultys, which drive him back to Man's fir&s;t Creation for the Ori|gni of In&s;ects in human Bodys; but we
<PB N="31" REF="30">&s;ee there's no &s;uch Difficulty in them, as to challenge our Compliance with him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another way how In&s;ects are generated in human Bodys, is, from the Seed it &s;elf: for con&s;ider we that the <HI>Se|men</HI> whereby Man is propagated, is &s;aid to abound with live In&s;ects; and can we imagine that Creatures of &s;uch vigorous, agile and minute Bodys, cannot penetrate and make their way thro' the inter&s;tices of the dilated Membranes of the <HI>Ovum Foeminaeum,</HI> get into the Rudiments of the <HI>Embrio,</HI> be &s;hut up in its Ve&s;&s;els, and be mix'd with its Fluids, circulate with the Blood and Juices, live, lay their Eggs, and breed in the Body of the <HI>Foetus?</HI> The <HI>Animalcula</HI> make up the &s;ubtile&s;t Part of the Ma&s;culine <HI>Semen;</HI> and it would be ridiculous to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;luggi&s;h vi&s;cid Part made its way into the <HI>Ovum,</HI> but the more &s;ubtile and active Part did not: Therefore the Repletion of the Seed with the&s;e, is &s;ufficient Foundation for future Generation, and a la&s;ting Progeny of the kind in every Man and Woman during Life. Now to a&s;&s;ert the De&s;truction of them in the Womb, were ab&s;urd, &s;eeing the <HI>Embrio</HI> is nouri&s;h'd with the fine&s;t Juices of the Mother's Body, which mu&s;t make as agreeable a repa&s;t for them, as they can meet with afterwards in the Bodys of Adults.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="31">
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The la&s;t way how I &s;uppo&s;e the In&s;ects in animal Bodys do come, is, from our Su&s;tentation or Food; and this I divide again into three, <HI>viz.</HI> That where|with we are nouri&s;h'd in the Womb. 2. That wherewith we are fed in our Infancy, to wit, the Mother's Milk: and, 3. That which pre&s;erves human Life ever after.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e: Let us remem|ber that the <HI>Embrio</HI> in the <HI>&V;terus</HI> is not only &s;urrounded with, but fed by the Mo|ther's Juices, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the <HI>Am|nios,</HI> in which are di&s;cover'd multitudes of <HI>Animalcula</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts: And the&s;e, together with the Fluid wherein they live and &s;port, getting into the Body and Ve&s;|&s;els of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> will leave the Seeds of a Vermin, which &s;hall never be extirpated. And from this may In&s;ects of &s;undry kinds be found in the Bodys of Abortives. Now that the Child receives &s;ome of its Nouri&s;hment from the Liquor contain'd in the <HI>Amnios,</HI> the learned and curious <HI>Hei&s;ter,</HI> Profe&s;&s;or of Anatomy at <HI>Altorf,</HI> has fully prov'd. But &s;uppo&s;e the Child had no part of its Nouri&s;hment from the&s;e Juices, yet is there not a con&s;tant Circulation of Fluids from Mother to Child, and back from the Child to the Mother again? And are there not mul|titudes of In&s;ects and <HI>Ova</HI> in the human
<PB N="33" REF="32">Blood, tho its globular Parts render them invi&s;ible to us? But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Suppo&s;e the Child &s;hould come into the World, free from all man|ner of In&s;ects or <HI>Ova</HI> (which yet is nei|ther probable nor po&s;&s;ible) after its Birth, is not much of its Food Milk? and are we not &s;atisfy'd that the Mother's Milk abounds with <HI>Animalcula?</HI> and is not here &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for the Generation of all the&s;e Myriads in the human Body, whil&s;t as yet an Infant? How are we to expect that the Infant's Body &s;hould be ca|pable to de&s;troy all that Vermin, &s;ince they e&s;cap'd the &s;trong Attrition of the Mother's Stomach, Lungs, and Mu&s;cles, all which are &s;tronger in the Mother, than it's rea&s;onable to expect in the In|fant?</P>
<P>The la&s;t Cau&s;e I a&s;&s;ign'd for the In|ge&s;tion and Generation of In&s;ects and <HI>Ova</HI> into our Bodys, was by tho&s;e Means which are the Pre&s;ervation and Support of human Life, during the remaining Cour&s;e of our time; and the&s;e are our Meat, Drink and Air: I &s;ay, from the Mixture of the <HI>Ova</HI> of In&s;ects with the&s;e. For altho it be &s;uppos'd that when we are Adult, our Stomachs are able to at|tenuate and dige&s;t, not only the inge&s;ted A|liments, but al&s;o many of the&s;e <HI>Ova,</HI> which
<PB N="34" REF="33">mu&s;t undergo the common Fate of At|trition and Comminution of their Par|ticles; but in Youth, e&s;pecially in Child|hood, the Stomach is weak, and the <HI>Ova</HI> e&s;cape, and generate In&s;ects in our Bodys. To this Cau&s;e may be added Children's irregular way of eating, often cramming down new Food, before the former was fully dige&s;ted, and got out of the Sto|mach, whereby their <HI>Chyle</HI> mu&s;t be coar&s;e and unprepar'd: a Vi&s;cidity will &s;ub&s;ide and line the in&s;ide of the Guts, and be|come a fit Ne&s;t for the <HI>Ova</HI> to take up their Re&s;idence in, and become a Filter to the <HI>Chyle,</HI> whereby the <HI>Ova</HI> of larger In&s;ects are detain'd, hatch'd, come to Life, generate, and become the Parents of an innumerable Progeny. Childrens incapa|city for Exerci&s;e contributes its &s;hare to this; for their Solids are weak and lax, and then their Food is not only &s;uch as abounds with <HI>Ova,</HI> but as the Parents of the&s;e <HI>Ova</HI> have found it a proper Recep|tacle for them, &s;o their Offspring mu&s;t find it exceedingly agreeable, <HI>viz.</HI> Milk, and the farinaceous Foods. I could a&s;&s;ign other Cau&s;es, but the&s;e are &s;ufficient. However, I deny that when we are A|dult, our Stomachs are &s;o very capable of attenuating, breaking, and dige&s;ting the Particles of the <HI>Ova;</HI> for that is more
<PB N="35" REF="34">properly the U&s;e of the Lungs, and the Effect of mu&s;cular Motion, to divide and grind down &s;uch <HI>Moleculae,</HI> or &s;mall Bo|dys. But when all the&s;e have exerted their utmo&s;t Force, &s;till great Numbers of both <HI>Ova</HI> and <HI>Animalcula</HI> e&s;cape all their Shocks; as is evident, 1&s;t, From the Ge|neration of Worms and In&s;ects in all parts of adult Bodys: 2ly. The Production of &s;uch Myriads of In&s;ects in dead Bodys in few Days, as quickly eat it up, e&s;pecially if the Sea&s;on be very warm. Now that all the&s;e are <HI>Ova</HI> &s;wimming in the Air, and falling upon, and breeding in dead Carca&s;es, I deny: for altho the&s;e In&s;ects may &s;eize upon it externally, yet far greater Numbers are produc'd from <HI>Ova</HI> and In&s;ects within the Carrion it &s;elf. This I am &s;atisfy'd of from the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations. 1&s;t, I have found incredible Num|bers of the&s;e little Animals, generated and living in the fle&s;hy Parts of dead Bodys, where both Skin and Scarf Skin have been &s;ound and intire: this I have &s;een, e&s;pe|cially in dead Fi&s;h, upon the Shore in Summer-time. 2ly, Take a dead Body in a hot Summer Sea&s;on, and cover it up from the Air, and you &s;hall find that this will not wholly prevent the Growth of In&s;ects, only it will be longer before they breed, and arrive at their Perfection; and
<PB N="36" REF="35">no doubt fewer in Number, from the De|privation of adventitious <HI>Ova</HI> and <HI>Ani|malcula</HI> from the Air. 3ly, The Con|&s;umption of human Bodys in the Grave, is a plain Proof of this; for let the Coffin be contriv'd never &s;o clo&s;e, or the Grave deep, yet great Numbers of Ver|min generate in the Body: Here the deep Interment prevents the Acce&s;&s;ion or Ad|dition of <HI>Ova</HI> from the Air, and the clo&s;ene&s;s of the Coffin hinders their get|ting in from the Earth; for I found in a Skull newly digg'd up out of a deep Grave (which had not been many Years &s;hut up) a great Multitude of &s;mall Worms of dif|ferent kinds, tho the Coffin was clo&s;e and &s;ound, till broken by the Sexton. I had lately under my care a Woman who void|ed, every Day by Stool, a Multitude of <HI>A&s;carides;</HI> &s;he was then pa&s;t 40 Years of Age, and had been accu&s;tom'd to this Evacuation every Morning for &s;everal Years pa&s;t. I was acquainted with a Gentleman, who di&s;charg'd every Morn|ing at Stool many large Knots of them clean before the Excrements, and yet both enjoy'd a good State of Health, had a good Appetite and Dige&s;tion: The fir&s;t I recover'd by pre&s;cribing a tedious Cour&s;e of Bitters, with daily Exerci&s;e; and the la&s;t by the Chalybeat Waters. I hope it
<PB N="37" REF="36">cannot be deny'd, that Dogs have as &s;trong a Dige&s;tion as mo&s;t Animals, and yet they are never free from the&s;e In&s;ects. This I think is &s;ufficient to invalidate the Strength of their Arguments, who affirm that the Force of adult Stomachs hinders the Generation of Worms, by breaking and grinding down their Eggs.</P>
<P>But now it remains in the la&s;t place, That I &s;how how I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e <HI>Animal|cula</HI> to come at the Seminal Bladders of Youth, when come to Puberty; and that is, (&s;uppo&s;ing them to come from with|out) the Number of Ve&s;&s;els in Infants or <HI>Embrios</HI> is much greater than in Adults: as Children advance in Years, tho the greater Ve&s;&s;els lengthen out and grow, yet the lea&s;t become more compact, their Diameters &s;horten, the quantity of Fluids admitted is &s;till le&s;s, till at la&s;t they refu&s;e all Acce&s;s to the Fluids, then clo&s;e up, grow together, and are changed into mi|nute Fibres, which requiring le&s;s Space, give more Liberty to the larger Ve&s;&s;els to expand them&s;elves; their Compre&s;&s;ion being le&s;&s;en'd, their Canals are enlarg'd, they allow more and larger Particles of Fluids to enter their Orifices, and move along their Tubes; the Membranes of the Ve&s;&s;els being yet dilatable, and the contain'd Liquor pre&s;&s;ing <HI>&V;ndiquaque,</HI> the
<PB N="38" REF="37">Diameters of the Ve&s;&s;els are lengthen'd, and their Orifices and Cavitys are propor|tionably widened, and are capable to ad|mit Particles of larger Diameters than they could formerly receive; among&s;t which, not only <HI>Ova,</HI> but minute In&s;ects get along. And this appears to be truly the Ca&s;e of the te&s;ticular Strainers; for during Infancy, the natural Narrowne&s;s of the&s;e Pipes, and that increas'd by innumerable &s;mall open Ve&s;&s;els, (which afterwards va|ni&s;h into &s;olid Fibres) render the Tubes &s;o exceedingly &s;mall, that only &s;o much in&s;ipid Humour and Nouri&s;hment is &s;uffer'd to enter, as &s;uffices to keep open their Cavity, and nouri&s;h their Parts. But when both their Cavity naturally increas'd, and the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els which wedge them in on every &s;ide have lo&s;t their Cavity, then not only a greater Quantity of Liquor will pa&s;s them, but Fluids con&s;i&s;ting of larger Particles and <HI>Ova</HI> together with them. 2ly, We &s;hall add hereto the dif|ferent &s;orts of <HI>Animalcula</HI> found in Water; Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> &s;ays, that from his Micro&s;copial Ob&s;ervations, eight Millions two Hun|dred and eighty Thou&s;and of living Crea|tures may be &s;een in one Drop of Water. And as the&s;e had been too few, when he had procured finer Gla&s;&s;es, they not only magnified the&s;e he had formerly di&s;cover'd
<PB N="39" REF="38">to a very great Magnitude, but ob&s;erv'd others much le&s;s than what he had for|merly &s;een, and &s;ome of them &s;o minute, that Millions of Millions of them might be contain'd in one Drop of Water. Now if we con&s;ider the State of the Te&s;ticles of Youth arriv'd at Puberty, I &s;ee no Difficulty why we may not allow the <HI>Ova</HI> of the&s;e little Animals to pa&s;s, and even the generated <HI>Animalcula</HI> them&s;elves may make way, and be driven thro' all the Turnings and Windings of the Te&s;ticles, till they come at the deferent Ve&s;&s;els, and Seminal Bladders. How improbable is it to expect that the Stomach &s;hould exert any con&s;iderable Force upon the <HI>Ova</HI> of &s;uch In&s;ects? 3ly, Another Pre&s;umption that the Cavity of the Te&s;ticular Glands is the Occa&s;ion of the Admi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Gue&s;ts, is, becau&s;e the mammillary Glands of the Brea&s;ts, which &s;eparate the Milk from the Blood, give ready Pa&s;&s;age to prodigious Numbers of the&s;e In&s;ects or their <HI>Ova,</HI> which may readily be di&s;cover'd by the help but of ordinary Gla&s;&s;es. Thus I have explain'd the Manner of the Gene|ration of In&s;ects in human Bodys; it now remains that I &s;hould treat of the u&s;e of the&s;e Seminal Worms, and enquire whe|ther they are rea&s;onably to be reputed the Rudiments of a human <HI>Foetus,</HI> or
<PB N="40" REF="39">whether each of them be an entire and perfect Man, as <HI>Leewenhoeck</HI> and his Followers teach and believe. But this would protract the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e far beyond its de&s;ign'd Bounds: wherefore I &s;hall defer this Inquiry to another Op|portunity.</P>
