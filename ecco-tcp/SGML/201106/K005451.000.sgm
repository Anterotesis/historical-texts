<HEAD>OF THE WORM-FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Worm-Fever, as it is called, being a di&s;order to which Children are pretty gene|rally liable, and frequently eluding the &s;kill of the phy&s;ician; it will not, I pre&s;ume, be unacceptable to the Public, if I lay before them a method of treating that di&s;order, which, in &s;everal in&s;tances of my own practice, has been attended with &s;uc|ce&s;s, and which, from the immedi|ate relief it gives the patients, I con|clude to be &s;pecifically adapted to the cure of it, and not &s;ucce&s;sful by accident only.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P>The difficulty of curing what is called a Worm-Fever, ari&s;es in my opinion from its being frequently at|tributed to Worms, when the cau&s;e of the di&s;order is of a quite different nature. I do not mean to deny that Worms do <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> abound in the human body, nor that the irritation cau&s;ed by them does <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> pro|duce a Fever; but I apprehend the&s;e ca&s;es to be much more uncommon than it is generally imagined, and that great mi&s;chief is done by treat|ing &s;ome of the di&s;orders of children as Worm-ca&s;es, which really are not &s;o.</P>
<P>That Practitioners are frequently deceived in this re&s;pect, is &s;ufficiently a&s;certained by the te&s;timony of Dr. Hunter, who a&s;&s;ures me that he has di&s;&s;ected great numbers of children,
<PB N="5" REF="4">who have been &s;uppo&s;ed to die of Worm-Fevers, and who&s;e com|plaints were of cour&s;e treated as proceeding from Worms, in whom, however, there appeared upon di&s;|&s;ection to be not only no Worms, but evident proofs of the di&s;order hav|ing been of a very different nature. A &s;ingle ca&s;e of this kind was pub|li&s;hed long ago in the Edinburgh Medical E&s;&s;ays by Profe&s;&s;or Sinclair, who, after informing us, that upon opening the body, no Worms were found, goes on to ob&s;erve, that <Q>"A di&s;appointment of this kind is no new thing; for all experien|ced Phy&s;icians know, that every &s;ymptom commonly produced by Worms, (except voiding them) &s;ometimes ari&s;es from other cau&s;es."</Q> If this be the ca&s;e, if it be no new thing for Phy&s;icians to
<PB N="6" REF="5">pre&s;cribe medicines again&s;t Worms to patients who have none, I am afraid it is no new thing al&s;o, un|der this mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, to do a great deal of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the&s;e mi&s;takes is plainly this, that people not only conclude too ha&s;tily from the exi&s;t|ence of a &s;ingle Worm, that there are many more behind; but they often (as Dr. Sinclair al&s;o intimates) infer the exi&s;tence of Worms from &s;igns that are very equivocal and uncertain; &s;uch as the &s;tools con|taining &s;ometimes a curdly mat|ter, like the curd of milk, and &s;ometimes a dark green &s;ub&s;tance, apparently full of filaments, like the conferva upon &s;tanding waters, the urine, at the &s;ame time, having a mixture of &s;omething creamy. With evacuations of this kind, if
<PB N="7" REF="6">the patient is flu&s;hed in the face, &s;tarts frequently from his &s;leep, and is much di&s;po&s;ed to rub his no&s;e, it is concluded, that though there be no Worms completely formed, there is yet a con&s;iderable quantity of the <HI>minera vermino&s;a,</HI> or <HI>&s;emini|um vermino&s;um,</HI> which mu&s;t be carried off by repeated purges.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, however, by Prac|titioners, that the di&s;order is much le&s;s ob&s;tinate and dangerous when the Worms appear to be completely formed, even though their number &s;hould be con&s;iderable, than when there is no evacuation of complete Worms, but only a large quantity of what is called the <HI>&s;eminium ver|mino&s;um:</HI> and yet in this la&s;t &s;tate, the animal being by &s;uppo&s;ition as yet in embryo, and quite invi&s;ible,
<PB N="8" REF="7">cannot give &s;o much irritation to the bowels, nor ab&s;orb &s;o much of the chyle, as when it is perfectly form|ed and active; and therefore ought not, upon this principle, to give &s;o much di&s;turbance to the body that it inhabits.</P>
<P>But further, it is remarked, that the &s;uppo&s;ed Worm-Ca&s;es do every now and then cau&s;e a &s;orene&s;s, pro|minency and inflammation of the navel, which, if it comes to &s;uppu|rate, the di&s;order &s;peedily gives way; whereas, if there is no &s;uch tendency to inflammation, it fre|quently proves fatal, and is at be&s;t very tedious and difficult of cure. Now, what connection can there be between a &s;uppuration of the navel, di&s;charging nothing but pus, and a real Worm-Ca&s;e? How comes
<PB N="9" REF="8">it to pa&s;s that all the bad &s;ymptoms &s;hall vani&s;h, as I have &s;een them do, upon the coming on of the &s;uppu|ration, if they had been produced by Worms lodged in the inte&s;tine, and &s;till continuing to lodge there?</P>
<P>Wherever this has been the ca&s;e, it &s;eems clear that the di&s;order mu&s;t have been only an irritation or morbid affection of the bowel, from the u&s;e of &s;ome improper food, which the &s;trength of the con&s;titution after a time throws out upon the external &s;urface of the body, producing at the &s;ame time a proportionable relief of the in|ternal and vital part. Now if this be the nature of the di&s;order in &s;ome few ca&s;es, it may not im|probably have been &s;o in many more, in which the efforts of Na|ture
<PB N="10" REF="9">have been checked; or, to &s;peak le&s;s metaphorically, in which the power of Nature has been too much weakened by injudicious and repeated purges.</P>
<P>That purges are often found in|effectual to di&s;lodge the Worms in children, is a fact acknowledged by tho&s;e who mo&s;t frequently u&s;e them in the &s;uppo&s;ed Worm-Ca&s;es. In|deed the difficulty of tho&s;e ca&s;es evidently &s;hews it, the general me|thod of cure being by repeated purges. If this, however, was the only inconvenience, if all that pur|ges did was to produce a little un|nece&s;&s;ary nau&s;ea and griping, the practice might be borne with; but unfortunately, what upon the com|mon &s;uppo&s;ition is only u&s;ele&s;s, up|on the contrary and more probable
<PB N="11" REF="10">&s;uppo&s;ition is pernicious and de|&s;tructive. Where the irritation of the bowels is di&s;po&s;ed to affect the brain, the proper indication, after carrying off the original offending matter, is to comfort and &s;trength|en the bowels, in&s;tead of weaken|ing them by frequent purges, which effectually prevent the irri|tating cau&s;e from di&s;charging it&s;elf upon the &s;urface. In children, par|ticularly, who&s;e nerves are tender, and in whom all irritations are rea|dily tran&s;mitted from the inte&s;tines and other remote parts of the body to the brain, the effects of too fre|quently repeating them are greatly to be dreaded. I have my&s;elf &s;een more than one in&s;tance, where the evacuations intended to carry off Worms from the bowels, though
<PB N="12" REF="11">not immoderate in quantity, have been &s;oon after followed by &s;light convul&s;ions, and other very threa|tening nervous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, unle&s;s we could be certain <HI>a priori,</HI> that the child we pre&s;cribe for has Worms, and Worms too in a con&s;iderable num|ber, I mu&s;t think it highly impru|dent and un&s;afe to teaze and weaken him by purging, which, if there be really no Worms, mu&s;t certainly do con&s;iderable harm. To tho&s;e Worm-medicines that are not pur|gative, there is not the &s;ame ob|jection, though &s;till there is little or no benefit to be expected from them in the &s;purious Worm-Fever, which, as I ob&s;erved before, is much the mo&s;t common of the two.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
<P>The &s;purious Worm-Fever, of which I come now to give an ac|count, has, in all the in&s;tances I have &s;een, ari&s;en evidently from the children having been indulged with too great quantities of fruit; though a poor cold diet of any kind may, for aught I know, oc|ca&s;ionally give birth to it. Every &s;ort of fruit eaten in exce&s;s, will probably produce it; and of cour&s;e, that which is to be had in the greate&s;t plenty, will, from its plenty, be the occa&s;ion of mo&s;t mi&s;chief. I am convinced, how|ever, as well from my own expe|rience, as by the ob&s;ervations of my medical friends, that a great pro|portion of the&s;e di&s;orders is pro|duced by the immoderate u&s;e of cherries, which may in part be
<PB N="14" REF="13">owing to a prevailing opinion of their innocence; &s;o that children are &s;uffered even by their parents to eat freely of them, without any &s;u&s;picion or apprehen&s;ion of dan|ger, which they are very &s;eldom &s;uffered to do of pears, plumbs, or apples.</P>
<P>There is no part of Nature &s;o open to doubt and &s;ceptici&s;m as me|dical &s;ubjects; and therefore it is not to be wondered that many people &s;hould entertain a notion of the innocence of fruit to children. Fruit, like mo&s;t other &s;ub&s;tances that we know, has a variety of effects upon the human body: To &s;ome it is &s;alutary and medicinal, to others innocent, and to a third &s;ort prejudicial. Where it is even prejudicial, the harm it does de|pends
<PB N="15" REF="14">in a great mea&s;ure upon the quantity; and the preci&s;e quantity that will be prejudicial, it is, from the great varieties of con&s;titution, impo&s;&s;ible to define. People not aware of this intricacy, can hardly be &s;aid to rea&s;on ill, when they in|fer, that what a great number eat with impunity is innocent to all. Yet further reflection would &s;ugge&s;t to them, that things the mo&s;t con|fe&s;&s;edly noxious do not in every con&s;titution produce the &s;ame ef|fects. The effluvia of the &s;mall|pox, for in&s;tance, will affect one man, while another, equally ex|po&s;ed to them, &s;hall e&s;cape. It would, therefore, be a very com|mendable piece of di&s;cretion, to pay a little more regard, upon this occa|&s;ion, to the judgment of our fore|fathers,
<PB N="16" REF="15">who are known to have been particularly cautious in the article of fruit, and attributed many of the di&s;orders of children to a too frequent or exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of it. And that this apprehen&s;ion was not wholly unrea&s;onable, will appear, I think, from the follow|ing reflection. We have all fre|quent opportunities of ob&s;erving, and mo&s;t of us have experienced, that fruit in no very large quan|tity will produce the colic; which it could not do, without being occa&s;ionally offen&s;ive and ho&s;tile to the body. Now, whatever is of|fen&s;ive and capable of creating pain, will, by change of circum|&s;tances, be capable of creating a di&s;order of a different kind; that
<PB N="17" REF="16">is, a fever, a diarrhoea, or a &s;tu|por, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brain.</P>
<P>The approach of this di&s;order has a different appearance, accord|ing as it ari&s;es from a habit of eating fruit in rather too large quan|tities, or from an exce&s;&s;ive quan|tity eaten at one time. In the former ca&s;e, the patient gradually grows weak and languid; his co|lour becomes pale and livid; his belly &s;wells and grows hard; his appetite and dige&s;tion are de&s;troyed; his nights grow re&s;tle&s;s, or at lea&s;t his &s;leep is much di&s;turbed with &s;tartings, and then the fever &s;oon follows: in the progre&s;s of which the patient grows comato&s;e, and at times convul&s;ed; in which &s;tate, when the event is fatal, he dies. The pul&s;e at the wri&s;t, though
<PB N="18" REF="17">quick, is never &s;trong or hard, as indeed it very &s;eldom is in any of the di&s;orders of children. The carotids, however, beat with great violence, and elevate the &s;kin, &s;o as to be di&s;tinctly &s;een at a di&s;tance. The heat is at times con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in the trunk; though at other times, when the brain is much oppre&s;&s;ed, it is little more than natural. It is &s;ometimes ac|companied by a violent pain of the epiga&s;tric region, though more commonly the pain is &s;light, and terminates in a coma; &s;ome de|gree of pain, however, &s;eems to be in&s;eparable from it, &s;o as clear|ly to di&s;tingui&s;h this di&s;order from other comato&s;e affections.</P>
<P>Where a large quantity of fruit has been eaten at once, the at|tack
<PB N="19" REF="18">of the di&s;order is in&s;tantane|ous, and its progre&s;s rapid; the patient often pa&s;&s;ing, in the &s;pace of a few hours, from apparently perfect health, to a &s;tupid, coma|to&s;e, and almo&s;t dying &s;tate. The &s;ymptoms of the fever, when form|ed, are in both ca&s;es nearly the &s;ame, except that in this latter &s;ort I have now and then &s;een a little purulent matter di&s;charged by vomit and &s;tool from the very fir&s;t day. The &s;tools in both &s;orts are &s;uch as I have already de&s;crib|ed; that is, they exhibit &s;ome|times a kind of curd, re&s;embling curdled milk, and at other times a floating &s;ub&s;tance, of the colour and appearance of conferva, &s;ome|times a number of little threads
<PB N="20" REF="19">and pellicles, and now and then a &s;ingle Worm.</P>
<P>If the patient, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, is too frequently or too &s;trongly purged, the complaints, af|ter a &s;hort interval of relief, return with great violence; the coma in|crea&s;es, or, in&s;tead of it, convul&s;ions come on. Where the di&s;order is not &s;o &s;evere, frequent purgings will bring on flatulent &s;hifting pains of the &s;ides and brea&s;t, and twitchings of the lips and face. As &s;oon as any thing of this kind appears, it is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;i&s;t immediately from purging. And as to bleeding, it is not to be thought of in any &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the illne&s;s, as the indige&s;ted matter and mucus that
<PB N="21" REF="20">lies in the &s;tomach and bowels has a tendency to keep up the morbid &s;ymptoms, it may be of great u&s;e to give one vomit and one purge; the vomit for a child of three or four years old, to con&s;i&s;t of a few grains of Ipecacuanha, or, which is rather better, three or four tea &s;poonfuls of Ipecacuanha wine, with ten drops of the e&s;&s;ence of Antimony. The purge for the &s;ame age may be; a powder of Jalap and Rhubarb, of each four grains, powder of Sena leaves and fine &s;ugar, of each &s;ix grains. When this has operated properly, there will very &s;eldom be any occa&s;ion for repeating it; and it will be &s;ufficient, if the body is co&s;tive, to throw up every &s;econd or third day, the following cly|&s;ter:
<PB N="22" REF="21">
<Q>&rx; Infus Flor. Chamaemel. unc. v. Aloes Caballin. drachm. &s;s. Fiat Solutio pro Enemate.</Q></P>
<P>But the principal part of the cure depends upon external appli|cations to the bowels and &s;tomach, which are the re&s;idence of the mor|bid cau&s;e, and from whence the mi&s;chief &s;preads as from a centre to the parts above and below. I have already delivered my &s;entiments with regard to external applica|tions, that they have a real di&s;tin|gui&s;hed efficacy, and that their ac|tion is not by ab&s;orption and circu|lation, but directly upon the nerves. As the cau&s;e of this di&s;|order is of a cold nature, the ap|plications mu&s;t be warm, cordial, and invigorating; and their action
<PB N="23" REF="22">mu&s;t be promoted by con&s;tant ac|tual heat. The following is a pre|&s;cription I have u&s;ed with &s;uc|ce&s;s:
<Q>&rx; Folior. Ab&s;inth. &amp; Rutae a~a~ p. aeq. Aq. Pur. Q. S.</Q> <HI>Fiat decoctum &s;aturati&s;&s;imum, quo calid&egrave; foveatur regio ventriculi &amp; abdomen quart&acirc; vel quint&acirc; quaque hor&acirc; per horae quadrantem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Magma ex herbis coctis po&s;t fot&ucirc;s u&s;um ii&s;dem partibus perpetu&ograve; appo|&s;itum teneatur, &amp; quoties refrixerit, aliud calidum apponatur.</HI> For in|ternal u&s;e, the following is all I have found nece&s;&s;ary:
<Q><L>&rx; Aq. Cinnam. &s;pir.</L>
<L>&mdash;Cinnamom. ten a~a~. unc. &s;s.</L>
<L>Ol. Amygdal. dulc. unc. i&s;s.</L>
<L>Syr. Bal&s;am. drachm. iij.</L></Q>
<PB N="24" REF="23"><HI>Mi&s;ce, &amp; tempore u&s;&ucirc;s fortiter con|cutiantur in phial&acirc;. Capiat pro ra|tione aetatis drachm. ij. ad drachm. vj. terti&acirc; quaque hor&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>If any nervous &s;ymptoms &s;hould come on or remain after the di&s;|order is abated, they will &s;oon be removed by giving a pill of four grains of A&s;a foetida once or twice a day. The benefit the children find from this, makes them, in|&s;tead of loathing, &s;oon grow fond of it, &s;o as to call for it of their own accord, if it is not brought them, and &s;ometimes prefer it to an orange or a &s;weetmeat.</P>
<P>It was before ob&s;erved, that the diagno&s;tics of Worms are very un|certain, which implies not only that they are &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected where they have no exi&s;tence; but on the
<PB N="25" REF="24">contrary al&s;o, that they &s;ometimes exi&s;t where they are not &s;u&s;pected. Hence it becomes a very natural que&s;tion, whether, if a real Worm-Ca&s;e &s;hould be treated in the man|ner here de&s;cribed, there would be any ri&s;que of its being increa&s;|ed by &s;uch treatment? or of its gaining ground by lo&s;s of time? My opinion upon both the&s;e que&s;tions is clearly, No; and that in ca&s;es, where we will &s;uppo&s;e the bowels to be really full of Worms, this method, with &s;ome &s;light alte|rations, is greatly preferable to tho&s;e which are commonly u&s;ed. As Worms either find the con&s;ti|tution weakly, or very &s;oon make it &s;o, the frequent repetition of purges, particularly mercurials, cannot but have a pernicious effect
<PB N="26" REF="25">upon children. Bearsfoot is &s;till more exceptionable, being in truth to be ranked rather among poi&s;ons than medicines. Worm-&s;eed, and all kinds of bitters are too offen|&s;ive to the palate and &s;tomach to be long per&s;i&s;ted in. The powder of Coralline creates di&s;gu&s;t by its quantity; and the infu&s;ion of pink|root is well known to occa&s;ion now and then vertiginous complaints and fits: and though &s;ome people a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e fits are owing to the contor&s;ion of the Worms in the bowels, when the infu&s;ion is not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to kill or &s;tupefy them; others, and parti|cularly Dr. Lining, are of a con|trary opinion, and impute the bad effects of it to an over-do&s;e. In this diver&s;ity of opinions, who will
<PB N="27" REF="26">po&s;itively undertake to &s;ay, that the accident &s;hall not happen? It is commonly, therefore, with &s;ome reluctance that parents &s;uffer it to be admini&s;tered to their children, who have on their parts, on ac|count of its &s;ickly and earthy ta&s;te, an equal aver&s;ion to taking it. But fomenting the belly night and morning with a &s;trong decoction of Rue and Wormwood, is a remedy very ea&s;y to be admini&s;tered, at|tended with no danger, and, in|&s;tead of weakening the bowels, has an evident tendency to corroborate them; which circum&s;tance alone contributes, perhaps, more than any thing el&s;e to the de&s;truction of Worms, the vigour of the con|tained or para&s;itical animal being overcome by the dige&s;tive powers
<PB N="28" REF="27">of the Vi&s;cera in which it is lodged. After the fomentation, it may be of u&s;e to anoint the belly with a liniment compo&s;ed of one part e&s;|&s;ential oil of Rue, with two parts of a decoction of Rue in &s;weet oil. Fore&s;tus, in his Ob&s;ervations, Lib. xxi. 33. mentions a remarkable cure effected by an ointment in which the gall of a bull [the text has it, <HI>fel Auri</HI>] was a principal ingredient. Where the decoction or e&s;&s;ential oil of Rue are not rea|dily to be procured, an ointment &s;trongly impregnated with this or ox's gall, would, I &s;uppo&s;e, be very efficacious. Of internal medicines, the be&s;t is A&s;a foetida, with an aloetic pill or two at proper in|tervals.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
<P>The diet of children di&s;po&s;ed to Worms &s;hould be warm and nou|ri&s;hing, con&s;i&s;ting in part at lea&s;t of animal food, which is not the wor&s;e for being a little &s;ea&s;oned. Their drink may be any kind of beer that is well hopped, with now and then a &s;mall draught of porter or negus. A total ab&s;tinence from butter is perhaps not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, as the generality of the world imagine. Hungry poor chee&s;e mu&s;t by all means be avoided; but rich pun|gent chee&s;e, in a moderate quan|tity, is particularly &s;erviceable. In the &s;purious Worm-Fever, the pa|tient &s;hould be &s;upported occa|&s;ionally by &s;mall quantities of broth; and at the clo&s;e of it, when the appetite returns, the fir&s;t food given &s;hould be of the kinds above
<PB N="30" REF="29">recommended, though in a very &s;mall quantity. As the patient grows &s;tronger, the quantity may be increa&s;ed, taking care, if po&s;|&s;ible, to avoid indige&s;tion; or, if it ari&s;es, correcting it with the fol|lowing powder:
<Q>&rx; Rhubarb. pulv. Magne&s;. alb. a~a~ gr. v. Spec. Aromat. gr. ij. Mi&s;ce.</Q></P>
<P>The diet here directed will, per|haps, be thought extraordinary, as the general idea is at pre&s;ent, that, in the management of children, nothing is &s;o much to be avoided as repletion and rich food. It is, no doubt, an error to feed children too well, or to indulge them with wine and rich &s;auces; but it is equally an error to confine them to too &s;trict or too poor a diet, which
<PB N="31" REF="30">weakens their dige&s;tion, and ren|ders them much more &s;ubject to di&s;orders of every kind; but parti|cularly to di&s;orders of the bowels.
