<P>In the Day of Pro&s;perity be joyful; but in the Day of Adver&s;ity con&s;ider.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IF ever <HI>France</HI> had Rea&s;on to be <HI>joyful,</HI> &s;he has as much Rea&s;on now to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> the greate&s;t <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> that ever could befall an unhappy People, now involving &s;ome of her riche&s;t Cities in the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ive Mi|&s;ery and Woe. When I talk after this Man|ner,
<PB N="2" REF="9">every Body knows I mean the <HI>Plague,</HI> which now rages with &s;uch invincible Fury in its extreme Parts; and, in all Probability without a particular Turn of Providence, mu&s;t rage too in its very Bowels. And thus, <HI>France,</HI> once the Terror of its Neighbours, is now be|come the Object of their Pity and Commi&s;e|ration. Alas! <HI>How are the Mighty fallen! How un&s;earchable,</HI> O Thou One Eternal Being, <HI>are thy Coun&s;els, and thy Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, human Life is Nothing but one con|tinued Series of Mi&s;eries; and we are born to Trouble, whic his as natural to befall us, as for the Sparks to fly upwards; or to u&s;e the Words of a Modern
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the</HI> 2d <HI>Vol. of the</HI> Penitential Tables, <HI>a Work printed for</HI> J.

<P>The Time of <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> is arrived; <HI>Adver|&s;ities</HI> enough &s;urround us through the unnatu|ral Ruin of our own once flouri&s;hing and glori|ous Country, and how far the dreadful Cala|mity, raging &s;o furiou&s;ly among our Neigh|bours may reach us, Heaven only knows. <HI>Prox|imus ardet,</HI> when the next Hou&s;e is on Fire,
<PB N="3" REF="10">it requires all our &s;erious Con&s;ideration, At|tention, and Application, to prevent catching hold of our own.</P>
<P>To do this, we ought to make u&s;e of all the Helps of Nature and Art; and the rich, who have Means to procure both, will not want all po&s;&s;ible Aid and Care: The Poor and the middle Sort, are here, as in all other Ca&s;es, to be the greate&s;t Sufferers. It is for the Sake of tho&s;e I publi&s;h this &s;mall, but I hope, u&s;eful Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> and <HI>Apothecaries</HI> &s;urely will not take this ami&s;s, it would be cruel to think &s;o; I know there are but two &s;orts of the&s;e, the Good, and the Bad; the Good will not, and as for the Bad, tho&s;e very few are not worth our Notice.</P>
<P>I am very well &s;atisfied, that there have come into the World a great many ingenious Trea|ti&s;es relating to the <HI>Plague;</HI> but as they have been, for the mo&s;t Part, very &s;peculative, they have &s;erved rather to di&s;play the fine Genius of their &s;everal Authors, than to be of any real U&s;e to Mankind. Alas! What avails it to know the nice Definitions of a Di&s;temper, its remote and proximate Cau&s;es, and a long Jargon of Particles, Effluvias, In&s;ects, and that infinite <HI>Gallimatias</HI> of Pe&s;tilential and pe&s;tiferous Ve|hicles, if I know not how to pre&s;erve my &s;elf from their Contagion, or rid my &s;elf of it, when I am &s;o unhappy as to labour under it? What I &s;hall do then, in the following Pages,
<PB N="4" REF="11">is in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;y Terms, familiar to the meane&s;t Capacity to write what I have learnt in relation to that which may be &s;ervice|able to my Reader concerning the Plague, which I am afraid, I have too ju&s;t Fears, will, in all Probability, without a particular Providence of the mo&s;t High, vi&s;it our already too wretched and undone Country.</P>
<P>But that I may not burthen my Readers Me|mory and Attention, I &s;hall, as &s;hort as the Na|ture of the Thing will admit of, pre&s;ent them with what are my Sentiments hereupon; and for Order Sake, divide this little Treati&s;e into four Heads or Chapters.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="12">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of Apparel and Diet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' at all Times we ought to ab&s;tain from all Manner of Exce&s;s, yet chiefly ought we &s;o to do in the Time of Pe&s;tilence; e&s;pecially from Exce&s;s of outward and inward Heat, as that of the Sun, Fire, Cloaths, and hot Air, all very pernicious; this I call outward Heat; inward Heat is &s;uch as proceeds from too much eating of Salt, and &s;alted Meats, Spices, and all Food of a &s;trong and inten&s;e Heat, and all &s;trong Malt Liquors, and &s;trong Wines and Spirits.</P>
<P>Violent Exerci&s;es are al&s;o to be avoided, &s;uch as provoke <HI>Sweatings,</HI> and particularly, <HI>Co|ition,</HI> and all the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind. One mu&s;t likewi&s;e ab&s;tain from all Repletion of Meat and Drink, that is, to ri&s;e from Table without loading your <HI>Stomach.</HI> The other Exce&s;s too is equally dangerous, I mean too great a Hunger and Thir&s;t; a great deal of
<PB N="6" REF="13">Sleep, e&s;pecially at Day-Time, is al&s;o to be carefully avoided, as well as letting the Body be too much bound up or co&s;tive: Thus much in General.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Apparel,</HI> what is made of Linnen, is certainly be&s;t; thick Woollens are apt to gather Infections; but Silk and Furs, and Stuffs made of Hair, are principally to be &s;hunned, becau&s;e they very ea&s;ily admit the contagious Air, and retain it a long while. But above all, let every body be particularly careful in being clean in their Dre&s;s, as well as Lodging. <HI>Hangings</HI> are by no Means to be allowed, bare Walls, or plain, unpainted Wain&s;cot, are the be&s;t Furniture; the&s;e cannot be kept too fre&s;h and clean.</P>
<P>The frequent Wa&s;hings among the <HI>Jews,</HI> though they had &s;omething my&s;tical in them, and were a Part of their Religion, were yet very conducive to Health; and in Reality, there can be no Religion in being a Sloven; <HI>Pauper|tatem &amp; non Sorditiem Habitus diligit Deus,</HI> God loves the Poverty, not the Slovenline&s;s of a Habit, &s;aid St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> of &s;ome dirty Reli|gious of his Time. The good old Man thought there was no Religion at all in being dirty or lou&s;y.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that is to be done in the Morning by tho&s;e that wear their Hair, is to comb it with an Ivory Comb Forty Times at lea&s;t, from the Forehead towards the Pole; after that, let them wa&s;h all the Organs of the
<PB N="7" REF="14">Sen&s;es, that is, the Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Tongue, and Teeth; in &s;hort, the whole Face, with pure Water, and they who wear Wigs, are to wa&s;h their Head in like Manner. The Eyes are not only to be wa&s;hed, but dipt, or plunged into cold Water, and all the Foulne&s;s removed from the Eye-lids with this cold Water; it is very nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to mix Ro&s;e-water, or Fennel-water and good &s;trong White|wine Vinegar; and after the Neck is wa&s;hed, which mu&s;t never be omitted, let it be rubbed with a Towel, &s;omewhat coar&s;er than ordi|nary. All this comforts the Body, makes the Mind more lively and chearful, and pre&s;erves the Sight.</P>
<P>The Gums and Mouth ought to be particu|larly taken Care to be wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed, and e&s;pecially the Teeth; to do which, no|thing is more proper than the following Den|tifrices, or Teeth-Powders, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A cheap Powder to clean&s;e the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take three dried Egg-&s;hells, of Red Coral three Drams, a &s;mall Quantity of the Threads of white Silk burnt to A&s;hes in a new earthen Pot or Pipkin; Cinnamon, one Dram; Cloves, two Drams; Pelitory-Root, two Drams.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="15">
<P>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, and rub your Teeth every Night and Morning, wa&s;h|ing them with cold Water mixed with Vine|gar, or Ro&s;e-water, or both: you may buy the Red Coral of the Apothecary, ready pow|dered.</P>

<P>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, &s;ear&s;ing the &s;ame through a Tiffany Sear&s;e, as you &s;hould the former.</P>
<P>Purify your Chamber and your Cloaths with clear Fires made of Juniper, Cypre&s;s, Pine, or A&s;h-wood; as al&s;o with frequent Sprinklings of Ro&s;e-water and Vinegar. It is al&s;o very good to &s;trew about your Rooms, &s;weet Herbs, and Flowers, as Ro&s;es, Violets, Vine-leaves, Pennyroyal, Thyme, Lavender, and the like, and frequently to make u&s;e of &s;everal Kinds of odoriferous Fumes to purge and purify the Air, and perfume your &s;elf and Cloaths, and very often to wa&s;h your Hands and Face every Day with Water mixed with Vinegar and Ro&s;e|water, and never go abroad without a Piece
<PB N="9" REF="16">of the Root of Dittany, or Zedoary, or &s;ome candid Spice, in your Mouth, and a No&s;egay, or &s;ome refre&s;hing Per&s;ume in your Hand; among which, I recommend a little Box of <HI>Warham</HI>'s <HI>Apoplectick Bal&s;am,</HI> made only at the <HI>Golden Ball</HI> in <HI>Fi&s;her-Street,</HI> near <HI>Red-Lyon-Square;</HI> which is of wonderful Efficacy, and with which it is good to anoint or &s;mear a little the Temples; Eye-brows, and No&s;trils: and always ju&s;t before you go out, take a Piece of Bay-leaf, or Orange-peel, or Juniper Berries, which being brui&s;ed and &s;oaked in a little Vi|negar, pour upon a red hot Iron, hold your Head over the Fumes, receiving them into your Mouth, No&s;trils, and every Part of your Body and Cloaths. Some will not go out without a little Bunch of Hy&s;&s;op, or Rue, which is very good.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who can take Tobacco, would do well to &s;moke a Pipe in the Morning the fir&s;t thing they do. Dr. <HI>Evans,</HI> of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Col|lege in <HI>Oxford,</HI> told me not long &s;ince, that he de&s;igned Tobacco &s;hould be his chief Me|dicine whenever it &s;hould plea&s;e God to vi&s;it us, and that he would fume his Chambers and Cloaths with nothing el&s;e; which may be very good for tho&s;e who are u&s;ed to Tobac|co; and I have been told, that during the la&s;t Sickne&s;s in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Tobacconi&s;ts</HI> e&s;ca|ped the Contagion.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="17">
<P>Having mentioned &s;everal Fumes and &s;weet Waters, I &s;hall here give a Receipt how to make tho&s;e mo&s;t u&s;eful, which becau&s;e they are cheap, and ea&s;ily made, may probably be not much e&s;teemed by &s;ome, who love Nothing but what is co&s;tly; but I write for the general Good.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of Diet.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very ea&s;y to de&s;cribe what Kind of Diet &s;hould be u&s;ed in &s;uch Times of Sickne&s;s, but it is not &s;o ea&s;y for all People to ob&s;erve it. I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, that &s;uch Food as the Appetite mo&s;t delights in, is the be&s;t: and of Con&s;equence, that which it does not care for, ought to be avoided. I do not &s;peak here of a depraved Appetite, which has been ruined and debauched by Luxury, for there can be no Rules pre&s;cri|bed for &s;uch, at lea&s;t what it will ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>The &s;impler, and the more plain the Diet is, the better. And here I could wi&s;h Man had kept up to Nature, and followed what the great Creator of all Things had
<PB N="16" REF="23">pre&s;cribed to the Infant World, and had &s;till fed on that innocent Food, the Fruits and Herbs of the Earth, and Milk, and the Gol|den Productions of the Indu&s;trious <HI>Bee:</HI> Then would his Blood have flowed free from tho&s;e noxious Juices engendred from &s;uch a Heterogeneous Commixture of the Spirits of &s;o many Thou&s;and Animals which an unbounded cruel Luxury continually &s;acrifices and de|lights.</P>
<P>Before the Flood, Men did not eat the Fle&s;h of Animals, and yet they lived much longer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law, indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure indulged its Followers in this Re&s;pect; but it mu&s;t be remembred, the Bill of Divorce was in like manner tolerated, for the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts. The Fle&s;h Pots of <HI>Egypt,</HI> (the <HI>French</HI> Ragous of that Time) ran in their Minds; but a Toleration is a quite different Thing from an Approbation; and how many Re&s;trictions this Toleration was attended with, every one knows that looks into the Bible; the mo&s;t delicious Food was ab&s;olutely for|bidden, as Swines Fle&s;h, and all Shell Fi&s;h; and the manner of dre&s;&s;ing was &s;uch, as re|quired the utmo&s;t Scrutiny in Relation to the Health of the Animal; and the Blood, as the Life or Soul, was particularly prohibited.</P>
<P>But the Chri&s;tian, who has a better Reli|gion, who profe&s;&s;es to follow a &s;uffering Lord, and Self-denying Saviour, tyrannizes over the
<PB N="17" REF="24">whole Creation, flies at all, and without the lea&s;t Remor&s;e or Scruple, devours Things &s;trangled, and &s;wallows Blood, though ex|pre&s;ly forbidden in the &s;ame Place with For|nication, in that which he owns to be written by In&s;piration, and a Law decreed by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>The poor Cow, to in&s;tance no more, after having fed Families with her own Dugs, mu&s;t by cruel, ungrateful Man, be knock'd on the Head, for all her good Offices, and at la&s;t de|voured; and the tender Lamb, ju&s;t dropt from its Mother, (true Emblem of &s;weete&s;t Inno|cence) be &s;natched, kneeling at the Teat, and &s;acrificed to &s;atisfy the Appetite, perhaps of a lewd Harlot.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Man</HI> is the Lord of the Crea|tion; &s;o is a Ma&s;ter of his Family: But what Lord devours his own Subjects? Or, what Father fea&s;ts upon his own Children and Servants?</P>
<P>I could an&s;wer all the vain, idle, frivolous Objections, that have been rai&s;ed again&s;t this unlawful Practice of de&s;troying the Creation; but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to write of Controver|&s;y, but Health; and however novel this may &s;eem to &s;ome, I am &s;ure, its oppo&s;ite is only an ancient inveterate Error.</P>
<P>And I am &s;atisfied, that Men, if they would or could ab&s;tain from eating the Fle&s;h of Ani|mals, wou'd find them&s;elves much better in Health; for it is that dreadful mixture of
<PB N="18" REF="25">the Souls, if I may &s;ay &s;o, of &s;o many thou&s;and Animals, de&s;troy'd to pamper one, that rai&s;es that terrible War in the Blood, which has made it a Prey to &s;uch Di&s;tempers, as have baffled the Skill of the mo&s;t learned Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Let us ca&s;t our Eyes towards <HI>India,</HI> and we &s;hall &s;ee the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> or <HI>Bramins,</HI> who never eat the Fle&s;h of <HI>Animals;</HI> and yet they live frequently to an Hundred Years of Age.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> there is a Religious Order called the <HI>Camaldole&s;e,</HI> or Monks of St. <HI>Romuald,</HI> who look healthy, and live long, and by their Profe&s;&s;ion they neither eat Fle&s;h nor Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Monks of <HI>La Trappe</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> do the &s;ame. This Regimen of Life ren|ders the Pa&s;&s;ions calm and quiet; while your Fle&s;h-Devourers are &s;oon irritated, im|mediately take Fire, and even, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, participate of the Nature of the Brutes they feed on.</P>
<P>And then how many Delicacies may be made without the Death of Animals? how many Ways of dre&s;&s;ing Herbs and Fruits, with Milk and Cream, Sugar and Honey, and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Spices? all the innocent Lux|ury of <HI>Pa&s;try</HI> and Confectionary, may here be introduced.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="26">
<P>But becau&s;e this Evil came in by De|grees, &s;o by Degrees it mu&s;t be extirpa|ted; and &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible quite to for|&s;ake it at once, we having derived from our Parents, a Blood made up of the&s;e Spirits, I &s;hall only advi&s;e my Readers to make U&s;e of Fle&s;h Diet as &s;paringly as po&s;|&s;ible, e&s;pecially in Time of <HI>Pe&s;tilence;</HI> let them chu&s;e that Sort, that they know they can be&s;t di|ge&s;t, and dre&s;s it thoroughly, and that too after the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple manner, avoid|ing all rich Soupes, Ragous, Frica&s;ies, <HI>A la Royalles, a la Daubes,</HI> or <HI>a la Diables,</HI> and all tho&s;e <HI>Heterogeneous, Gallican,</HI> or rather <HI>Aegyptian Slip&s;lops,</HI> which are poy&s;onous, and create &s;uch malignant Juices in the Blood, which ea&s;ily unite with the pe&s;tilential <HI>Ef|fluvia,</HI> and become a proper Fewel for the <HI>Plague.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Broyling</HI> is undoubtedly the be&s;t Way of Dre&s;&s;ing, over a clear Fire, the Meat being thoroughly fir&s;t clean&s;ed from all Blood, and moderately &s;ea&s;oned with Salt; for Salt &s;a|vours all Things, and the Fire purifies all Things.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Roa&s;ting,</HI> for the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Boyling</HI> comes next, which mu&s;t be done with a large Quantity of Water, that the Meat may have Room enough; and as &s;oon
<PB N="20" REF="27">as the Pot boils, take off the Cover, that the Steam may go up.</P>
<P><HI>Frying</HI> and <HI>Stewing</HI> are the wor&s;t of all, un|le&s;s the Stew-pan be uncovered; and <HI>Frying</HI> is not very whol&s;ome, becau&s;e of the Fat the Meat mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;wim in, which hinders the Fire from pa&s;&s;ing through the Meat. And <HI>Stewing,</HI> unle&s;s there be a great deal of Li|quor, is only a genteel Name for <HI>Frying.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>Sauces,</HI> or <HI>Sea&s;oning,</HI> I recommend, e&s;pecially with fre&s;h Fi&s;h, (tho' indeed I do not approve of any Fi&s;h in the Time of Contagion: I &s;ay, for <HI>Sauces</HI> or <HI>Sea&s;onings,</HI> I recommend) Tormentil, Dittany, Fennel, Dill, Gentian, Zedoary, Sanders, never forgetting Ro&s;es; and al&s;o Vinegar, and Vinegar of Ro&s;es; e&s;|pecially, Citron, <HI>Seville</HI> Orange, and Lemon Juices; as al&s;o Juice of Sorrel, Verjuice, Juice of Pomegranates and Barberries, for all Acids or Sours re&s;i&s;t the pe&s;tilential Poy&s;on, for they are refre&s;hing, drying, comfort and pre|&s;erve; however, if they offend the Brea&s;t, qualify them with Sugar; if the Stomach, with a &s;mall Quantity of Pepper; for Pepper re&s;i&s;ts the Putrefaction of the Humours, &s;trengthens Dige&s;tion; and, provided it be not ground too &s;mall, but powdered a little, that is, ju&s;t broken, it helps the Liver.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Kinds of Sea&s;onings, you &s;hould al&s;o u&s;e Onions, Garlick, Saffron, Ra|di&s;hes, Succory, Capers, pickled Cucum|bers, Samphire, Mangoes, and all &s;orts of

<PB N="22" REF="29">
<P><HI>Take of White Chry&s;talline Ar&s;enick, two Oun|ces; of Red, one Ounce.</HI></P>
<P>Make of the&s;e two a little Cake about an Inch broad, mixed up with the White of an Egg, or a Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, that is, with Gum Tragacanth di&s;&s;olved in Ro&s;e-water, till it be of the Thickne&s;s of a Jelly.</P>
<P>Let this Cake be &s;ewed up in a Piece of clean Linnen Cloth, enclo&s;ed with Silk, and hung about the Neck, towards the Heart.</P>
<P>You need not put your Shirt between; for though Ar&s;enick taken inwardly be mortal, not on Account of any occult Quality, but its corro&s;ive Nature; and &s;o, properly &s;peaking, is no Poy&s;on; yet being outwardly applied, it re&s;i&s;ts every thing that is &s;o.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Another.</HEAD>

<P>Let all the&s;e be brui&s;ed, and &s;teeped in Ro&s;e|water, with an equal Quantity of White|wine Vinegar, or Juice of Sorrel, to which you may add, half an Ounce of Juniper Ber|ries. Take the Quantity of a Che&s;nut of this Preparation, fa&s;ting. It is an excellent Pre|&s;ervative.</P>

<P>Take of this, mixed up with half an Ounce of Sorrel Juice, or any other eager Juice, the Quantity of two Beans, fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pre&s;ervative Electuary</HI> was u&s;ed with good Succe&s;s by Don <HI>Pri&s;cian</HI> of <HI>Corduba,</HI> Phy|&s;ician
<PB N="24" REF="31">to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> X. and recommended by the famous <HI>Rantzovius.</HI></P>

<P>I &s;hall now give you another Receipt of great Virtue, which is,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Electuary of Eggs.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Take a new laid Egg, which, after having taken out the White, and Cock's Tread, fill with the be&s;t powdered Saffron, then clo&s;e the whole, and burn it over a &s;low Fire till it turn black, then grind it in a Mortar; to which add its Weight of Seed of Eruca, or white Mu&s;tard; incorporate the whole very well.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Electuary take the Quantity of a Pea, every Morning, with a little Wine and Ro&s;e-water; you may add to this, if you will, (for it makes the Compo&s;ition
<PB N="26" REF="33">much better) White Dittany, and Tor|mentill, of each two Drams; Nux Vomica, one Dram, &s;eparately powdered before you add them to the re&s;t. Add al&s;o of the Roots of Pimpernell, Zedoary, Angelica, and Cam|phire, and as much Treacle as the Weight of the whole.</P>
<P>This Electuary is not only an excellent An|tidote or Pre&s;ervative, but is good when one is actually infected, in order to cure the Di|&s;temper; to be given one Dram with White|wine, if the Sickne&s;s begins with Cold; or with Ro&s;e-water, or Scabious Water, if with Heat; but it ought to be taken in Twelve Hours Time after the Beginning of the Di|&s;temper</P>
<P>The&s;e are the be&s;t Antidotes or Pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the <HI>Plague,</HI> which may be u&s;ed with good Succe&s;s; but by no means omit taking Pill Ruffi once or twice a Week, about the Weight of a Scruple in the Morning, without any other Medicine.</P>
<P>But if the Sea&s;on be very hot, then let the Aloes and Myrrh, which are in the Compo&s;i|tion of that Pill, be well wa&s;hed in Ro&s;e-wa|ter; and you may add of the be&s;t Camphire, a third Part of the Quantity of Myrrh; but in cold Weather, and in cold Complexions, the Pill mu&s;t be taken without the&s;e Prepa|tions of Wa&s;hing and Camphire.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="34">
<P>Be&s;ides, as the&s;e Pills are &s;omewhat too opening, it would be good in &s;uch Ca&s;es, to add to them a &s;mall quantity of Bole Ar|moniack, or to roll them up in its Powder; and as &s;ometimes they hurt the Stomach, this Evil is to be corrected with a little Mixture of the be&s;t Ma&s;tick, and a little <HI>Venice</HI>-Treacle, or Mithridate, that is, two or three Scru|ples.
